The Cylons were created by man
They evolved
They Rebelled
There are many copies
And they have a plan
Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
This Planet is Kobol
The birthplace of mankind.
Organise a ground survey team.
Three Raptors.
Put it down!
Get down!
She just jumped away
go back to Caprica
and bring me the arrow...
I will show us the way to Earth
Starbuck?
I'm terminating your presidency
as of this moment.
I'm placing you under arrest.
This is mutiny. You know that.
Come.
See the face
of the shape of things to come.
Isn't she beautiful, Gaius?
I'm not a Cylon.
This isn't happening.
You can't fight destiny, Sharon.
It catches up with you.
No matter what you do.
Where are the medics? Where's Doc Cottle?
Off ship, on rounds in the fleet, sir. Stand clear!
Sgt. Fisher reporting, sir.
It's gonna be okay. Okay.
I'm your new shipmate. Bill Adama.
Saul Tigh.
H-he's gonna be okay.
Okay, we've got tension pneumo.
- I'm gonna stick him and release the pressure.
- He's gonna be okay.
What's going oŁn? What happened?
Sergeant of the guard, secure that thing in the brig.
Aye, sir. Hollis, Wenzler, let's go. Let's go!
Ah! No! Wait!
Okay, he's breathing!
Let's get him down to sickbay, RFN.
What the hell?
Valerii's shot the old man.
What?
Three, one, two
She must be a Cylon,
Colonel's in command. You are second.
Make a hole!
As you were, Captain.
Like hell!
Put him in the brig.
Colonel! Colonel Tigh!
He's my father! Colonel!
Colonel. Could this be
a prelude to a Cylon attack?
How would they know where we are?
Valerii could've told them, sir.
What? How?
When we aboard the base star,
she left the raptor for
a few minutes
and came back without her helmet.
She might've told the Cylons
everything. Our position, defenses
Colonel, the toasters
have knocked out our CO.
This has gotta be part of a bigger plan.
I recommend we execute jump
to urgency standby coordinates.
Colonel, I've located Doc Cottle.
He's aboard the rising star.
Dradis!
Signal of contact, Cylon base
star bearing 4-8-7 carom 0-1-5.
Sir, we can't stay here.
Sir.
So what's your plan here?
Personally, I tend  to go with what you know.
'Til something better turns up.
Sir!
Dee, alert the fleet.
We are making an immediate
jump to the emergency coordinates.
Sir, Doc Cottle is still 15 minutes away.
He'll have to rejoin us
on the other side of the jump.
Sir! What about our people
on the surface of Kobol?
If they're still alive, they'll have to wait.
FTL?
Go!
Nav-con?
Go!
Galactica to all vessels.
Prepare to make immediate FTL
jump to escape coordinates alpha.
I say again, escape coordinates alpha.
Clock will start on my mark.
Mark.
Captain, what have they done to you?
What's going on?
My father's been shot.
What?
Someone get this frakkin'
thing off me, please?
I'm not authorized to do that.
I'm behind the frakkin' bars!
Captain.
How bad is your father?
Bad.
Two bullets in the chest.
Is Dr. Cottle with him?
No, Doc Cottle's not on board.
Attention, Galactica. Fleet is away.
Stand by to jump in five,
four, three, two, one
Jump.
Jump completed.
Report.
Report!
Dradis is empty, no contacts.
No contacts?
Where is the fleet?
Dee!
Checking all channels.
No colonial signals.
They're gone, sir.
Isn't she beautiful, Gaius?
I don't think I have ever been
touched so deeply in my entire life.
You're going to make a wonderful father.
Speaking metaphorically, of course.
And literally.
She's our child, gaius.
Our little girl.
What?
Do you want to hold her?
Yes. Yes, of course I do.
But she's not real.
Any more than, uh
any of this is. Real.
She's real.
She is?
She may not be with
you yet, but she will be. Soon.
I'm having a little difficulty...
I'm trying to understand,
I want to understand. I...
You are the mother.
And you're the father.
Am I the father?
Excuse me?
Dream,
I'm been clearly having a dream
We're moving out, sir. Get up.
And if you wouldn't mind carrying
something this time, that'd be great.
This is serisone, it should help
you breathe a little easier.
Here, just take it easy.
You'll be feeling
better in a few minutes.
Excuse me, sir.
We've got to get you up.
- It hurt.
- I know.
If you don't mind my asking,
where are we going, Crashdown?
Tree line. We can hide,
still see the crash site in case
Galactica sends a rescue party.
Galactica will be
sending a rescue party.
Everybody down!
what was that?
That Cylons?
Maybe. Seelix, grab the ammo.
Staggered formation, I'll take point.
Chief, you're bringing up the rear.
Be ready to tell the private, people.
Lt? I think we should double-check
the supplies before we bug out.
Sorry, Chief, we don't
have the time.
If that's an aircraft turbine, they're
gonna be oŁn us any moment.
Lt, we gotta make
sure we have everything!
We don't have the time, Chief!
Damn it.
Gods Damn it!
What's going on, saul?
here's the fleet?
We don't know, they
jumped to another location.
You've got blood on your pants.
Why would they do that?
Every watch we update our emergency
jump calculations with new star
fixes to compensate for inertial
drift, and then we transmit
them to the rest of the fleet.
This time ours were updated,
but theirs weren't.
Gaeta was supposed to transmit
them to the rest of the fleet.
So it's Gaeta's fault.
Oh, the kid was overwhelmed.
He had his hands full.
If you say so. It sounds like a
pretty big screw-up to me
I should have checked before
I gave the order to jump!
This doesn't sound like you, Saul.
You don't let people slide.
You bust their ass.
Now, if Bill doesn't make it...
- He'll make it.
- If he doesn't,
this will be your ship,
your command.
All I'm saying is you need...
This is Bill Adama's ship.
This is his command.
His orders are still the word
of the gods on this ship.
Just so we're clear.
This will be Adama's command
until the day he dies.
And we are not going to
let him die.
So say we all.
As you were.
So how do we find the fleet?
If we jump back to our
original coordinates,
our nav computers can use those star
fixes to generate a best fit solution,
given the fleet's current position.
The Cylons are waiting for us back there.
How long will that take to
calculate once we get back there?
If we shut down all
our functions, 12 hours.
There's no way we can hold off
a Cylon base star for 12 hours.
We have got to jump back.
We can't stay here.
Lt Thrace won't be able to find us once
she retrieves the arrow from caprica.
If she retrieves the arrow.
She'll retrieve the arrow.
Captain, you've got to get reinstated.
You've got to get back to CIC.
Gotta denounce me, disavow me,
do whatever you need to do.
Colonel Tigh cannot relocate this
fleet on his own without your father.
Tigh's not letting me out of here.
I put a gun to his head.
He won't forget that anytime soon.
I am so sorry that
I got you into this, Captain.
No, don't apologize.
I knew what I was doing.
But I didn't do it for you.
I did it for
well, actually, I did it
for nothing, turns out.
That's not true.
You took a stand.
And now look at us.
Watch your foot.
Everyone take five.
Give me the med kit.
Where's the med kit?
How you doing?
Hey, how you doing, buddy?
Good.
Just listening to the birds.
I'll be damned. I don't remember
the last time I heard birds.
Take it easy, okay?
Damn it.
We're out of serisone.
It's all right,
I'll get the other med kit.
What other med kit?
Oh, don't frakkin' tell me.
We pulled two med kits from the ship.
I told you to keep an
eye on both of them.
I only saw the oŁne, sir.
There were two.
I'm sorry, sir, but
I don't remember you telling me
Well, I did!
Sir, his lungs are
filling up with fluid.
If he doesn't get more serisone soon,
he's not gonna make it.
Okay, Tarn.
You forgot the med kit, so you're
gonna have to go back and get it.
Take a rifle, three clips
of ammo, and a canteen.
What?
Move.
Cally, come here.
Watch the rear.
Lt. You can't send him alone.
You questioning my orders, Chief?
No, I'm just pointing out
flaw in your plan.
Doesn't need to be
ny bigger than that.
Cally and I can go with him.
All right, fine, but
would you look out for Cally?
Cally, give me the rifle.
We three go. Leave that,
leave your backpack.
Sidearms out.
Tarn, you're bringing
up the rear in the middle,
shh. Eyes and ears.
Her consciousness is being downloaded
into another body right now.
And when she wakes up, she'll
tell them exactly where we are.
She's right, we can't stay here.
She's right, huh?
Sharon the Cylon is right.
It's all just,
"listen to Sharon the Cylon."
"Do whatever she says."
Cause that's a good idea.
Hey, Kara, she
helped me get this far.
Okay, I get it. I get it, Helo.
You and I go way back, so I get it.
All right, I remember how you felt about
her, but that is not the real Sharon.
That is some cheap knock-off copy.
I'm not a copy.
I'm Sharon.
I remember the first day
I met you, Starbuck.
You were puking your guts out in the
head because you'd eaten bad oysters on
Don't do that.
Hey!
I don't like it and I don't like you.
So the best thing you can do is
just keep your damn mouth shut.
Starbuck.
Put it down, for gods' sakes.
What do you want from me, Helo?
She's a Cylon.
You've been had.
We've been had.
So what, I'm just supposed
to be nice to her?
Because she says
she's pregnant?
Get out of the way.
No.
Carl, do not think that I will not...
I'm not gonna let you kill her!
Okay? She's carrying my child.
My gods, men are so
painfully stupid sometimes!
How do you know that?
I know, all right?
She is not lying.
They lie about everything, Helo.
Their entire existence is a lie.
They're not human, Helo.
They're machines.
You can't have a baby with a machine.
I don't know what to tell you. Okay?
But I believe her.
I-it's hard to describe.
We've been together a long time.
I mean, I know what she is,
but she is not like the others.
She is not.
No, no, no, no, no!
Bitch took my ride.
How's he doing?
Well, the bullet's tore up his spleen.
His blood pressure is way down.
Somebody needs to get in there and
stop the bleeding, or we'll lose him.
So what's your plan?
Don't really have one.
I'm getting back into the cockpit.
I'm getting back into my fleet.
And I want you to come with me, Saul.
You really believe that we
can get back in the fleet?
Yeah, I do. Yeah, I do.
How long 'til Doc Cotter's aboard?
I don't know.
It's gonna be a while.
He doesn't have  much time, sir.
You're gonna have to go in yourself.
Me? I'm just a medic.
Today you're a doctor.
Colonel.
Open cell.
How's the Commander?
You've bungled the job.
If that's what you're asking.
Then he's alive.
Thank the gods.
How many of our pilots were Cylons?
I don't know.
Who gave the order
to shoot the old man?
No one.
Just get it over with,
you frakkin' coward.
Give me your firearm.
Give me your gun!
Yes, sir.
Just shoot me.
Get it over with.
Okay, Tarn. Go up, take a look.
If it's not there, it's at the raptor.
And we'll have to move up more.
I got it, Chief.
All right, let's get
the hell out of here.
Tarn on point.
Let's go. Go, go, go, go, go.
This makes no sense.
Why am I carrying the med
kit when you forgot it?
First of all that's Lt's kit.
Secondly, I'm oŁn point.
Whatever.
All right, children, that's enough.
I'll tell you what, Cally.
If it makes you feel any better,
I'll put him on hangar deck
mop-up duty with you for next week.
Now you're talkin'.
For what?
If anybody should have
mop duty, it's Lt.
Go! Go! Get down!
Top of the ridge!
Cally, take the rifle and cover me!
Suppressive fire.
Okay, okay, wait for me.
Wait for me, all right?
Go, go, go, go, go.
Don't move! I'm coming
for you, don't move.
Jeez! 'm coming. Give me fire! Cally, go, go!
They're dug in, Chief. I can't see them.
Cover me! Come on. Come on.
Come on Chief
You'll be okay, you're okay.
You're okay, you're okay. It's okay.
Get on my back. Get on my back.
Get on me, get on me.
Chief, they're not
following us anymore.
Cally, there. There.
I know you're hit, buddy.
It's okay, I'm gonna check you right
now. I'm gonna put him here, Cal
Here, stay down.
Be with me right here.
Okay, I'm gonna check you right now.
It's not that bad, it's not that bad.
It's not that bad. Cally, check the ridge.
I wanna go home, Chief.
I know, I know. We're going home.
We're going home, okay? Okay.
Sh, sh, sh, sh. It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay. Stay with me.
Hey, hey. Look at me. Look at me.
Stay with me, stay with me.
Be with me, be with me.Come on,
come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Chief.
Chief, we gotta go.
We gotta go.
We gotta go.
Chief.
That's it. That's it,
you stupid, frakked-up crap!
Chief, Socinus needs
us now. Come on.
Come on. Let's go.
Not your fault, Lieutenant.
Not from where I was standing.
I was the O.O.D.
It was crazy in there, sir.
Can't blame yourself.
So we jump back to
the last coordinates.
But we network the FTL computer with
a nav, dc, and fire control computers.
Once they're linked, we'll only need
ten minutes to complete the calculations.
You can't be serious.
The old man would never
do this, Colonel.
- No computer networks on his ship.
- I acknowledge that, sir.
But I can devise a software
firewall that will buy us more time.
Really, you're gonna out-think
the Cylons at computer software?
Sir, if we don't do this,
we're never gonna find the fleet.
Certainly not
before the commander dies.
This is still
the old man's command.
We can't do
something he'd oppose,
especially when it puts
the entire ship at risk.
This is the XO.
Begin jump prep.
Those are  my orders.
The kid is back in the fleet.
So, let's have the truth.
How did you do it? How'd you
get off this frakkin' freighter?
Connections.
Anne's father has a friend
on the defense subcommittee.
So the new wife comes through.
Wish I had in-laws with pull.
Gimme a couple of years.
I'll have some pull.
You watch me.
I'll have my own battlestar one day.
Open up, please.
All right.
You have my parole.
When I'm on duty, I'll make no attempt to
free her or sow insurrection among the crew.
And when I'm not oŁn duty,
I'll report directly back to this cell.
Pre-flight brief is
underway in the ready room.
Right.
Good hunting, Captain.
Thank you, Madam President!
Colonel, once you find the fleet,
I'd like to have a word with you.
There's nothing to talk about. You went
up against the old man and you lost.
We jump in, we hold off the Cylons.
We crunch the numbers.
Then we jump out.
That's it. Simple plan.
Not so simple to do.
Computers have been networked.
My board is green, sir.
All stations report ready to jump.
That software firewall ready?
Best I can make it, sir.
Wish Dr. Baltar was here.
To hell with that. Take your work over
that shifty son of a bitch any day.
Stand by. In five, four,
three, two, jump.
Jump completed.
Report?
Multiple dradis contacts.
Cylon base star and multiple
Cylon raiders bearing  4-8-7 carom 2-2-1.
Lieutenant.
Computations underway.
We'll be able to plot the
fleet's position in seven minutes.
Whoohoo! Ha ha ha! Let's get these psychos!
Hey flyboy, you know we got
a pool going, right?
See who gets the most
kills now that Starbuck's awol.
Well, we know i'm gonna clean up.
Flyboys, shut up and focus.
This is not a simulation.
Roger that.
His heart stopped!
Defib, now!
Power's unstable,the battery
units are at the aid stations.
Well, then, get me a knife.
Weapons free.
And open racks.
And engage!
Here they come.
Cylons are hacking our network.
Attempting to access our gateway.
Now it's a race.
First firewall penetrated.
Sierra Alpha, we got a new bogey.
What is that thing?
I don't know, but whatever it is,
it's bearing on Galactica.
We gotta take it out.
Apollo, Hotdog offensive.
Three right, five at two.
Tally, Hotdog.  Count on me.
Roger that. I'm with you, leader.
Will you pray with me?
Help us, Lords of Kobol.
Help your prophet Laura guide
us to the path of righteousness.
That we might...
that we might destroy our enemies.
Let us walk the path of righteousness
and lift our faces unto your goodness.
Help us turn away from
the calls of the wicked
and show us the knowledge
of your certain salvation.
We offer this prayer.
Calculations at 56%.
Second firewall's been breached.
Frak they're fast!
Third firewall down!
Approaching Galactica's  flak barrier.
Cylon target within gun range.
Winged it!
Apollo! We're straying into
Galactica's engagement zone!
I'm almost there, I'm almost there.
I'm almost there, come on!
Back! Back, back!
Damn it!
I had it!
Apollo reports impact
on the starboard flight pod.
You got a decompression
in the flight pod.
No explosion. No fire.
Repeat, no fire.
No fire.
Calculations at 80%. Almost there.
They're through the fourth firewall.
One left until they've
accessed our mainframe.
Frakker.
Whoo! That was mine, that was mine!
Come on, come on.
We have a solution
for the fleet's position.
Break the network.
Network is broken!
Computers restored to local control.
Tell the vipers to get back aboard.
We're getting awful lucky today.
Prepare to jump.
Vipers aboard, sir.
Stand by.
In five, four, three, two, jump.
Jump completed.
Report?
Multiple contacts 'round the board.
Colonial transponder, sir. We found 'em!
Captain Kelly.
- Lieutenant Gaeta.
- Sir.
Dee.
Contact the Rising Star.
Tell Cottle to get his
ass over here A.S.A.P.
Hell of a job.
From now on, no more
heart massages for me.
I'm sticking to
pills and enemas.
Sir.
Let's hear it.
Well, I managed to stop the bleeding.
Um, but  he's still critical.
Doc's on his way.
Can you hear me, Bill?
Go away.
Captain Tigh, It's the shore patrol.
Sergeant Watkins, sir.
Open up, please.
Major Adama's compliments.
He wishes me to inform you you've
been reinstated in the colonial fleet.
With the rank of Captain.
Major Adama.
Welcome back to the fleet, sir.
I'll be right with you, Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
You never should have
brought me back in the service.
If you'd just let me be, I'd have
died back there in Caprica along with
everyone else, and
been happier for it.
I don't want to command.
I never did
Don't you dare die on me now

go back to Caprica
and bring me the arrow...
I will show us the way to Earth
What do you want from me, Helo?
She's a Cylon.
I'm not gonna let you kill her!
Okay? She's carrying my child.
Bitch took my ride.
I'm placing you under arrest.
This is mutiny. You know that.
I'm terminating your presidency
as of this moment.
I recommend we execute jump
to urgency standby coordinates.
What about our people
on the surface of Kobol?
If they're still alive,
they'll have to wait.
He's not gonna make it.
You're gonna have to
go back and get it.
- Lt. You can't send him alone.
- You questioning my orders, Chief?
I don't want to command.
I never did.
Don't you dare die on me now
Cylons are hacking our network.
Attempting to access our mainframe
What is that thing?
I don't know, but whatever it is,
it's bearing on Galactica.
We gotta take it out.
Hey.
Uh, hey.
Quite a day, huh?
Yeah.
Wow, I...
I haven't seen you in person since...
Two weeks ago.
I've really been thinking about you.
That's nice. I gotta go.
Uh, hey, Dee. Dee, hey. Hey.
Listen...
I know that I haven't
really made an effort,
or it must seem like I really
haven't made an effort to make this,
whatever this is,  a priority, but...
But? But you were too busy helping the
President spark a mutiny on my ship?
Or, but you wanted to
wait until you were
desperate and needed a shoulder to
cry on before making your move.
I think that was
a little uncalled for.
Yeah...I'm sorry.
You're right.
I gotta go.
What the hell?
Grab the emergency flashlights.
Copy that. Check the ventilator.
Report status.
Let's check subsystems.
Let's get emergency power back on.
Flyboy!
Hotdog!
Over here, Kat. Come here.
XO cydra.
Uh, it's the virus, sir.
I think it must have
spawned copies of itself in
some other computer systems.
It's knocked out main
power and auxiliary units.
Emergency power
just kicked back in.
Hey, captain, nice work out there.
I'm not sure what you guys are
kissing and hugging about.
We screwed up.
We let one through.
Yes, sir.
- What's going on with the lights?
- I'm not sure.
We still have no idea if we
can reach most of the ship.
What the hell was that?
Not sure, sir. Checking.
Power's out, sir.
I think it's shipwide.
Sound-powered phone's the only
thing working.
Tried to get through to damage
control, but the lines are jammed.
Okay, get the birds tied down,
make the ordinance safe.
I'll head up to combat,
see what the hell's going on.
Say again.
Sullen's reporting the
starboard flight pod.
We've been boarded.
Okay, look,
when I came up on his six,
all right, he rotated,
so I had to bug out. It was plain,
clean, and simple.
Did you see when I turned on
that pair chasing me on the port beam?
Yeah, saw that. That was sweet.
I rotate, pulled back,
hit the brakes and there...bang!
Left one's lined up dead center ring.
I chatter him,
turn back to get his wingman...
It's a Cylon, come on.Let's get outta of here.
Frack! Get outta of here! No, come on!
Go, go, go!
Go!
47.874 survivors
in search of a home
Called Earth
Come on, come on! Hurry!
Get through the hatch! Go!
Get up the ladder, go!
Get up, get up the ladder!
You all right, Captain?
Still breathing.
I guess that's all right.
Kat, Hotdog!
You all right?
Think so.
Can I get back to you on that?
Sitrep?
We've been boarded, sir.
Don't know how many, where they are,
where they're headed.
Our standard ammo doesn't
even make a dent.
Explosive rounds are the only
way to take 'em down.
How many rounds you got?
That was our last one.
Hotdog.
Take this to C.I.C.
Give it to Colonel Tigh
or the officer in charge.
Yes, sir.
Marines.
Let's get toaster shopping.
All clear sir!
- Kat, on me.
- Yes, sir.
Galactica to all ships.
We have been boarded by a
cylon raiding party.
Do not approach or attempt to
dock with galactica.
Keep a safe distance until we
have secured the ship.
I say again, we have been
boarded by a cylon raiding...ah!
What the hell was that?
The cylons jammed the signal.
Great.
Are those gunshots?
Yeah.
We can't stay in here.
Open the door.
You know I can't do that,
Madame President.
Corporal Venner, I have
no intention of being
locked in this cell and
shot like a rat in a cage.
Open the door!
Thank you.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Corporal Venner, don't shoot!
It's Captain Adama.
I have a fire team with me.
Come on in, Captain.
Watch the companionway.
We're clear, sir.
We've been boarded.
This deck is crawling with cylons.
They're trying to get to the magazines.
How can we help?
Stay alive and don't get shot.
Leave the cylons to us.
Okay, sickbay is the safest spot.
It's farthest away
from any potential targets,
and it's designed to
function as a disaster shelter
in case the ship were lost.
Bonnington, sidearm.
Sir
Okay, Billy, you ever
handled a weapon before?
Pelt gun from my uncle
when I was, like, ten.
Principle's the same.
Real ones just make a bigger noise.
Madame president.
No, thank you. I can't.
- Corporal.
- Yes?
You're in charge of
getting her down to sickbay.
Take Bonnington as escort.
Remember, just head away
from the sound of gunfire.
Right.
What about you?
We're heading towards the gunfire.
Okay, listen up.
There's a small arms locker on
causeway bravo, two decks down.
We're gonna go get some
explosive rounds,
and then we're heading
for the magazines.
- Twinam
- Sir.
- You take point.
- Yes sir
Good luck, Captain.
May the lords protect you.
Yeah, you too.
- Clear
- Okay, let's go.
We should probably
head out of the city,
try to scout one of
the outlying airbases.
See if we can find a rapter.
That's not
exactly what I expected.
Thought I'd be stepping over
decaying corpses in the streets.
Yeah, we saw a few bodies
here and there.
Not much though.
Sharon said that...
cylon sharon said they had
troops picking up the bodies.
Transporting them to
mass incinerators.
Your girlfriend's from
a lovely family.
Good people, great values.
Enough, all right.
Okay, I was fooled by her,
she fooled me.
You happy now?
It's not about making me happy.
Then what's it about?
What do you want here?
You want me to say I'm a
fracking idiot, okay.
I'm a fracking idiot.
That make you feel better?
I don't care anymore.
I've been here for months.
By myself, on the run.
on step ahead of the cylons.
With the cylons, I guess, actually.
She seemed so real.
Like Sharon,
you know?
Same grin, same laugh.
All the little things.
I feel in love with a machine.
That's stupid. So just call me an
idiot, and let's be done with it.
You're an idiot.
All right?
You're an idiot.
But the cylons have a way of
making all of us look like idiots.
Kara, what are you doing?
Making a pit stop.
I got something I gotta pick up.
Hey, we gotta keep going.
I got a place here, Helo.
The cylon virus spawned itself in our
subsystems before we broke the network.
I have teams cleaning each subsystem,
but it'll be at least an hour
before we can restore main power.
Captain?
What few marines we have are assembling
at their checkpoints, but comm's spotty.
Where are the cylons?
Looks like they split into two
forces. One moving forward...
and one moving aft.
Yes, sir.
I've seen this before.
These are their objectives.
Secondary damage control
and auxiliary fire control, sir.
If they're successful,
they will override their decompression
safeties and vent us all into space.
And once we're all dead,
they'll turn the ship's guns on the
fleet and wipe it out once and for all.
Dr. Baltar.
God.
How in god's name did you find us?
What do you have there?
Well, it's a child, obviously.
A child.
Can I hold it?
Please.
Is this the shape of things to come?
That's my understanding.
Only one thing for it then.
Commander? Please.
Commander,
where are you going?
Come back!
Commander!
Commander.
Commander, please.
No!
Shh. Shh...
He killed our baby.
Our baby?
Adama...
I saw him drown the baby.
Why would anyone want
to drown a baby?
Gaius, the answer's all around us.
What happened here?
Human sacrifice.
Not the fairy tales your
"scriptures" would have you believe.
I thought kobol was supposed
to be a paradise or something.
Some place where gods live
with the humans in harmony, or...
For a time, perhaps.
Then your true nature asserted itself.
Your brutality, your depravity,
your barbarism.
So the "scriptures" are all a lie.
It's all just a lie, just a
cover-up for all this...savagery.
Exactly. All of this has
happened before, Gaius.
And all of it will happen again.
Adama.
Mankind's true nature will
always assert itself.
So he will try and kill our baby.
Only if you let him, Gaius.
Only if you let him.
Keep your eyes up ahead.
Come on.
Come on!
Okay, go. Go, go, go, go, go.
- Is it clear?
- Yeah.
Okay. Keypads dead.
Don't shoot,
don't shoot, I'm human!
Jammer?
Yes sir, it's me. It's me. Jammer,
don't shoot, please.
Collishaw! Watch the hatch.
Kat!
- Find those explosive rounds.
- Sir
What the hell happened here?
I don't know, sir.
I was here in this fort.
I just came in here to hide.
Cylons everywhere.
All right, settle down, settle down.
You're gonna be just fine.
Apollo?
You're kidding me. That's it?
Didn't have much to begin with, sir.
The other fire teams must have
cleaned the locker out right before us.
Six rounds. There are five of us.
Okay, well...
each of you guys take one.
I'll take the reload.
Wait, you're not counting me,
are you, sir?
I mean, I'm just... I mean,
I'm just a knuckledragger here.
I don't know how to fight centurions.
I don't know the first thing
about fighting centurions!
Come on. Let's go.
Let's do it.
You never have your house
keys when you need 'em.
These yours?
You paint these, Kara?
Yeah.
How the hell did you get power.
Batteries.
Kept turning off the power.
Something about not paying a bill.
That is definitely not you.
It's my dad.
Well, we got one
package of noodles.
You don't believe
in groceries?
You know, I never really
liked this place anyway.
Air conditioning doesn't
work in the summer.
Heater doesn't work in the winter.
The rent's a crime.
After they attacked, I never...
I never pined over any of my old crap.
Never missed it.
Stupid view of the parking lot.
Broken toilet in the bathroom.
You know, everyone I know...
is fighting to get
back what they had.
And I'm fighting 'cause I don't
know how to do anything else.
How far to sickbay?
60 meters.
She stopped breathing a while ago.
Dee?
Ohh my gods Dee.
Hey. Are you all right?
Yeah, I was going to the head.
Oh, my god, you're bleeding.
Went back to my rack.
Are you shot?
I forgot something.
Hey.
Dee, look at me.
Dee, look at me. Dee.
Try using her rank.
Petty officer Dualla,
look at me.
Hey.
Hey.
I'm glad to see you.
I've been here in
the dark a long time.
It's probably a concussion.
Corporal Venner.
We need an alternate route to sickbay.
Give me your eyes.
Look at me.
We don't want to
walk into gunfire.
We want to go away from the cylons.
Now clear your head.
Come on.
We could, we can go in the,
all the way on the starboard side.
It's a lot farther.
Good. Starboard.
Lt Wallace reports his unit destroyed
two centurions at this junction.
They trapped a third in
the ship's laundry.
It can't walk, but it's still shooting.
At least we've contained the
threat to auxiliary fire control.
Trust me. They're still
heading for the aft damage control.
Lt. Gaeta
Sergeant Hadrian reports her units
had to halt their advance on
deck 10 at frame 69.
Sounds cut through the hull ahead of her
and the compartments are open to space.
Smart move.
Keeps us from chasin' 'em.
There is nothing between
the last two cylons
and the decompression safeties.
If you know any prayers,
now's the time.
What do you say we take five?
How much further, do you think?
Tarn getting shot,
it wasn't your fault.
You know that, right?
Chief?
Talk to me,
you mother-frakker!
"Mother-frakker"?
Socinus better appreciate this.
He's probably lyin' in the sun
like some gods-damn emperor.
He's an idiot.
I hope he's okay.
He'll be fine.
He's a tough kid. We just...
gotta get him the medkit.
Yeah, we gotta go, Cally.
- Crashdown! - Shhh!
Where the hell have you been?
Where have you been?
Doc, where have you been?
Answer me.
I got lost...
Doc, you never run off like that.
You are under my command.
This is a military operation,
do you understand me?
What I want to hear from
you is, "yes, sir!"
Yes, sir!
Look, Crashdown, I,
I'm getting a really bad
feeling about this place.
Oh, yeah, you and me, both, doc.
Flash! Flash!
Thunder.
Go, go, go.
Here. Here. Here.
Where's Tarn?
What happened?
Cylons.
Were you followed?
No.
How's he doing?
He's not gonna make it.
What?
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
We've got the medkit; give him a shot.
Give him another shot!
Too late.
What do you mean it's too late?
I got you the medkit.
What else do you want?
So we go get the
medicine you asked for.
Tarn...for what? For this!
Come on, you
gotta do something.
You have to do something.
I can't change that
he's gonna die,Chief.
It's gonna be slow and painful.
And we can spare him that.
We can spare him that if we
give him the morpha
from my kit and the one
that you brought back.
What?
No.
Lt?
Lt, come on.
He's your man, Chief.
Give it to me.
Hey, buddy.
It's Chief. How ya doin'?
What's goin' on, Chief?
Well, you know.
Just listenin'to the birds.
I, uh... I got a little
somethin' for the pain.
Good news, buddy.
We got a rescue party here.
The raptor just landed.
We're gonna put you on it,
take you back to Galactica. Okay?
I'm goin' home?
Yeah. You're goin' home.
How are you coming, Jammer?
That should do it, captain.
Hey, nice job.
You guys, check the
deck, check the lockers.
There's gotta be
more rounds in here.
Combat, 12-8-6-4-2.
Arms locker. Apollo here.
Colonel, it's Apollo. He's on
deck 12, abaft frame 8-6.
That's between the cylons and
aft damage control.
Apollo, XO. Sitrep.
Five armed defectors. We haven't
seen anything but bodies between
here and the hangar deck.
Clear.
Okay, from what I can remember,
the sickbay's about 20 meters
through that hatch.
How are you feeling?
Like I'm walking underwater.
Any marines with you?
Privates Collishaw, Twinam.
Take your men and proceed
without delay to aft damage control.
Is that yours?
Oh, uh, yeah. I guess it is now.
Okay, if you're gonna
keep it in your trousers like that...
you might want to
turn the safety on.
All righty.
Is it stuck?
Oh, frak!
The hatch won't open.
The other side's been de-pressurized.
All right, Corporal venner,
this is your ship.
I'm just a tourist.
Find us another way to sickbay.
Okay, um...
Okay, we have to head
toward aft damage control.
Aft damage control.
Aft damage control
That's what they're after.
Let's not waste any more time.
You get to aft damage control and
get there right frakking now, mister.
Get there before the cylons,
or we lose the ship. Is that clear?
Aft damage control rfn.
on our way. Apollo out.
Okay, hold on.
Okay, we made it.
Twinam and jammer,
you take this side.
Kat, Collishaw, you take that side.
We're gonna need some cover!
Let's get this stuff out.
Wait.
Okay, everybody,
get down, stay down.
Hold your fire until
I give the signal.
Remember, you only
have one round,
so it's gotta be a
head shot to make a kill.
Do you understand? Understood?
Yes, sir.
Kat,
kill the flashlight.
Take cover! Take cover!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Steady up there, Jammer.
Yes, sir. I'm not really cut
out for this, sir.
Me neither.
Sometimes you got
to roll a hard six.
Wh-what does that mean, sir?
Uh...
I don't know.
It's something my dad says.
Just...don't shoot until I
tell ya to. All right.
Okay, we're in good shape.
They're coming.
But we're in good shape.
Head shot. Reload. Head shot.
Head shot. Reload. Head shot.
Reload. Head shot.
Okay, they're coming.
Everybody down!
You want to shoot that,
you got to take the safety off.
Damn it!
Fire!
Frak!
Hey, hey...
Are you all right?
Yes. I'm fine.
We did it! We got 'em all!
They don't look
so big now, do they?
They look big enough.
I'll, uh, I'll take that.
Yeah.
Have you been shot?
No, I don't think so.
- Yeah
- I'm fine.
The gods must
be watching over you.
Tired of walking?
Okay.
Thanks.
Hey.
How do you feel?
Better.
I thought you said...
Forget what I said.
And listen to what I'm saying.
You listening?
I'm sorry. I,
I didn't hear that.
Could you, uh... could you
do that one more time?
Let me be clear.
Get the curtain.
Doc cottle's on his way.
He'll be here any minute.
He's going to be all right.
You know that.
Yeah. Yeah, I-I know that.
Colonel, I assume there's still
a cell out there waiting for me.
That's right.
Corporal Venner, I'm ready.
I can't believe you sided with
that woman against the old man.
I wouldn't do that if you put
a gun to my head. And you did.
As far as I'm concerned,
you're not fit to wear a uniform.
You're right about that part.
I am not fit to wear the uniform.
Maybe I never was.
Then again, neither are you.
This isn't my ship.
And it sure as hell isn't yours.
It's his.
And when he wakes up...
he'll decide what to do
with the both of us.
Thank the gods I didn't have kids.

The Cylons were created by man.
They evolved.
They rebelled.
There are many copies.
And they have a plan.
Previously on Battlestar Galactica:
This will be Adama's command
until the day he dies.
And we are not going to
let him die.
Sir! What about our people
on the surface of Kobol?
If they're still alive,
they'll have to wait.
Lt? I think we should double-check
the supplies before we bug out.
We don't have the time.
I could give you a shot,
but you wouldn't like the side effects.
Just do it.
The time is going to come when you won't
be able to hide what you're going through.
Sir, his lungs are
filling up with fluid.
If he doesn't get more serisone soon,
he's not gonna make it.
Tarn, you forgot the med kit, so you're
gonna have to go back and get it.
Take a rifle, three clips
of ammo, and a canteen.
Too late.
He's not gonna make it.
I'm sorry, Chief.
Lords of Kobol,
take these brave men into your arms.
Take upon...
in your arms the spirits
of our fallen friends,
so that they may share in
the everlasting life
that awaits us all beyond the vale of tears.
So say we all.
So say we all.
Nothing awaits them.
No eternal life, no damnation.
Only oblivion.
Because they haven't seen
the face of God, I take it.
Because they died here.
On Kobol.
- I see.
- Doc...
Let's go.
We're moving out.
Doc, you hear me?
- We're moving out.
- I did hear you, Chief.
I just don't respond to the title "Doc."
A "dock" is a platform for
loading and unloading material.
My title is "Doctor," or
"Mr. Vice President," if you don't mind.
You are loading, are you not?
El-tee?
El-tee?
Crash!
Hmm? Oh, yeah, Chief,
I'll be right there.
- No Cylons.
- You sure?
Uh-oh. Wait a minute.
Tree-line, two o'clock.
- Got 'em.
- What are they doing?
- Looks like they're dismantling the ship.
- Why?
Why not just use it to fly
the hell out of here?
I don't know.
I can't tell.
They're... dragging it into the tree-line.
It's, uh... oh, wait oh minute.
They're building something.
- Chief, is that a...
- A missile.
They're building a missile battery.
Well, at least we know
why they're not chasing us.
Why?
- Why aren't they chasing us?
- Because they don't have to.
They can just sit back,
launch a missile barrage
that'll wipe out every
living thing in this valley.
Next time I say I'm in a hurry,
cycle the damn air lock faster.
Is this your first day?
Doctor, thank the Gods, you're here.
The President needs your help.
- Move.
- Doctor...
Doctor!
Okay... let's have some vitals.
Like now.
Two bullets, 9 mm.
This one lacerated the spleen,
the other one nicked the aorta.
Now, we've removed the spleen,
and we thought we repaired the aorta, but--
Over the past few hours,
his BP'S dropped down again.
It's only 80 over 40.
And his heart rate's creeping
into the 130s.
Well, you missed something.
He's still hemorrhaging somewhere.
We're gonna lose him unless
we can stop that bleeding.
Get me an ABG, CBC and coags,
and get set up for a rapid
sequence intubation.
- Is he gonna make it?
- How should I know?
I'm not a psychic.
Now get the hell out of here.

It is a mess in here.
Looks like the mesenteric

3.7 mac.
God damn it, Kim, learn the instruments.
I said a 3.7 mac!
Sorry.
Clamp. Clamp!
Dr. Cottle, his pressure's dropping.
It's 60 on 30.
Heart rate's starting to fall.
I don't think he can last much longer.
Just stay focused.
Get some more suction in here
so I can see what I'm doing.
Ahem. Colonel...
how's the Commander?
What?
- Uh, ahem, how's the Commander?
- He's still in surgery.
What's on your mind?
Uh, I need some medication
for the President.
She's not the President anymore.
Cottle's a little busy right now.
Sir, she's very ill...
Why aren't you in the brig?
Um... because...
no one put me in there?
What the hell's all this?
Why aren't you in the brig?
I'm on duty, Sir.
Planning the search and rescue mission.
Search and rescue?
For who?
We lose a plane, and nobody tells me?!
For our Raptor crew down
on the surface of Kobol, Sir?
Simes is senior pilot now.
He can plan the SAR.
You asked me to command the
air group when I'm on duty.
So am I in command... or not?
What's the status of
the SAR, Captain?
Well, we don't know in what
area Raptor 3 went down.
So the only realistic chance
we have of finding her is to hope
that her transponder disaster
beacon is still functioning.
I intend to take two Raptors,
one with medical personnel,
and make five low level
orbits of the planet.
What about the Cylon base ship
that Lieutenant Valerii supposedly destroyed?
What if she was lying?
Racetrack confirmed the
destruction of the base ship,
and I checked the gun camera
footage from the Raptors,
which verifies it.
Lieutenant Gaeta,
why are you hovering about?
- Uh, it's the press.
- The press?
They're demanding to know
how much longer we plan on holding them,
and when they can
contact their home ships.
They demand? They're in no
position to demand anything.
You tell them to shut their yaps.
We'll get to them in due time.
Excuse me, Colonel.
Shuttle from the Zephyr has just requested
permission to enter the landing pattern.
- The Zephyr?
- Yes, Sir.
Evidently the Quorum of Twelve is aboard.
They're demanding to see you.
They demand?
Demanding job,
commanding a Battlestar.
Clear them to land.
Put them in the ward room
and hold them there until
I have time to see them.
Madam President.
What's wrong with her?
I don't know, but she's clearly sick.
You can see that, can't you?
Well, there's nothing I can do.
- Madam President...
- Yes?
Can I get you anything
while you're in the brig?
Really?
No, thank you.
I'm sorry.
I'm finding it... hard to think.
It's withdrawal.
- The chamalla?
- Yes.
I'm trying to get you more.
Go fast.
I count... six missiles being
carried into the forest site so far.
It's all so pointless.
We kill them.
And they kill us.
So we kill more of them.
They kill more of us.
What's the point anymore?
You and your...
race invented murder.
Invented killing for sport, greed, envy.
It's man's one true art form.
You've done some killing
of your own, I think.
Yes, well, we're your children.
You taught us well.
Why does God want to bring
a child into this kind of world anyway?
Because, despite everything,
despite all of it,
he still wants to offer you salvation.
Our child will bring
that salvation, but only if you
accept your role as her father.
And her guardian.
I'm not ready for that.
All right?
I'm not a father.
I'm not a guardian.
I'm not a moral leader
capable of leading anyone.
Let alone a baby.
Be a man, Gaius.
What?
Be a man.
Whatever else
you are, you are that.
The time is coming when
you'll have to act like one.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
El-tee, check this out.
What do you got, Chief?
45 degrees east of the launcher.
You see that tree stump?
- What the hell is that?
- It looks like a dradis dish.
At least, the Cylon version of a dradis dish.
It's probably salvaged from
the nose cone of the ship.
They're building an anti-aircraft battery.
Anti-aircraft? For what?
There are no other aircraft around here.
The Galactica's gonna send
a search and rescue team.
When they do, that's at least two
Raptors doing a low pass over the crash site.
When those Raptors come looking for us,
risking their lives to rescue us...
Cylons will shoot 'em down.
Seven birds down for repairs.
Three out on picket duty with the cap.
Uh, con traffic, Sir.
Priority messages are on top.
Cut to the chase, Captain!
How long before you launch the SAR?
Come on, Dee,
these are all marked "priority."
Sorry, Sir, that's how they came in.
I'm cannibalizing 305 for parts.
Should be up in the air in,
I don't know, 90 minutes.
90 minutes?!
We got men down on that frakking planet!
Get your head in the game.
You do your job, or go back to the brig.
Are on the members of
the Quorum in the ward room?
All 12, Sir.
Don't suppose you wanna do this for me?
Never was much for public speaking, Sir.
So why are we here under guard?
That's what I want to know.
Laura Roslin suborned mutiny
and sedition aboard this ship.
She caused a key military
asset to be lost at a critical moment!
The Commander felt he had no choice
but to remove her from power.
- You've said that, several times.
- Well, ...
You don't seem to be listening, Colonel.
It does not matter what Adama felt.
- He had absolutely no authority...
- Adama knew exactly what he was doing.
He was paving the way to declare martial
law and usher in a military dictatorship.
- Isn't that right, Colonel?
- I can't speak for the Commander.
He's still in surgery.
Well, you seem to be giving
the orders around here.
So what exactly are you planning to do?
- Are you declaring martial law?
- Absolutely not.
I know for a fact that the old man
hated the very idea of martial law.
He believed in freedom and
democracy and all that good stuff.
Well, since this is still a...
democracy, and all that good stuff,
I move that the Quorum demand
immediate access to President Roslin.
Excellent. I second it.
All those in favor.
Aye.
Motion carries. Colonel,
we demand immediate
access to the President.
I will take your "demand"
under advisement.
Madam President.
Madam President.
- I have to consider...
- Laura. Laura.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Are you all right?
I, uh, just came down to see if
there was anything I could do for you.
Anything I can get you?
I would like to have a conversation
with my attorney.
Could you arrange that?
Yeah. Yeah, sure, right.
Laura, do you know where you are?
I'm in jail.
- What's my name?
- Have we met?
I'm...
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
There's just...
a ringing.
Excuse me.
Ringing?
Right.
Okay, then.
Take care.
Oh, my Gods.
Ellen Tigh.
Ellen?
Lords of Kobol...
The launcher looks like a simple
point-and-shoot. No built-in guidance.
Ordnance appear to be standard
ship-to-ship missiles.
They're modifying them for
atmospheric flight.
one Cylon Centurion walks the perimeter,
stopping at regular intervals.
The dradis dish that controls
the missiles is on the 4.5 kg wavelength,
judging by the diameter.
It's guarded by two
Centurions, I think.
I'm sorry, Doc, did you say it
was guarded by two Centurions?
Yes, I did.
Okay, is the dradis guarded
continuously of intermittently?
I saw two Centurions
through the field glasses...
continuously, for five minutes.
In that time, they didn't leave their post.
So there's three toasters near the launcher.
Two more out by the dish.
That's a lot of Cylons.
You ever handle a weapon?
Who, me?
No.
I'm not a soldier, Crashdown.
I'll try to give you the most simple
assignment, but I'm gonna need every man.
You're not suggesting
we attack the Cylons?
We owe it to Socinus and Tarn
to tack the frakkers
out before they kill anyone else.
We have equal numbers.
We have the element of surprise.
Therefore, we have the initiative.
We can attack at the time
and place of our choosing.
El-tee, a word... in private.
He's crazy.
I'm not trained for this kind of thing.
I've never fired a gun in my life.
I haven't fired one since basic.
You?
I just joined to pay for dental school.
Basic ground assault was
a long time ago. For all of us.
Those aren't training officers out there.
They're programmed killing machines.
We don't have any choice.
Galactica will definitely be sending
a search and rescue party,
It's just a matter of time.
And if we don't take out that launcher...
we can't go up against an armed
and defended position like that.
- They'll wipe us out in the first
two minutes. - That's enough!
Chief, look, under the circumstances,
it's important that you keep your cool.
- I don't believe I've lost my cool.
- I disagree.
Look, I don't want to attack
the launcher either, but it's our duty.
We owe it to the rescue party,
and we owe it to Socinus and Tarn.
I fail to see what this has
to do with Socinus and Tarn.
Maybe that's why I'm an officer,
and you're not.
Dismissed.
This briefing will outline
a plan of attack in five graphs.
Graph one: Situation.
Our situation is that we are stranded on
Kobol with a group of five Cylons
who plan to use an AAU
to destroy any SAR craft sent to find us.
There are no friendly forces present.
What's all this graph business?
- Graph two...
- It's a five-paragraph order.
It's a basic command tool.
It's taught at officer candidate school.
It's just not usually used this...
literally in the field.
Graph four: Execution.
We will assault the Cylon launch
site from the northwest, using...
Oh, come on.
This is absurd.
What, we're talking on
the Cylon army, are we?
Us?
Look at us.
What, with two rifles and a canteen?
- Have you lost your mind?
- That's enough, Doctor.
Is it? Look, no disrespect,
but why are we always going uphill?
Does anybody else think
that this plan is frakking nuts?
I'll tell you what's fair. This is fair.
We'll have a show of hands...
No!
Absolutely not!
This is not a democracy!
The El-Tee's in charge!
The El-Tee's in charge.
No ifs, no ands, no buts.
He say we go, we go.
There's no questions...
We've already lost two men, Chief!
How many more people are we gonna lose?
You need to sit down.
And shut up right now.
Nobody tells me to shut up.
I'm the Vice President...
You need to sit down
and shut up right now.
Your briefing, El-Tee.
Thank you, Chief.
Graph four.
We'll approach the Cylon launch
site from the northwest,
using natural ground
cover to mask our approach.
Our objective is the command and control
console. once we reach this position,
Cally, you're gonna flank out to the left,
making a feint on the Cylon position.
Hopefully drawing their
fire long enough for me and Seelix
to flank out to the right and
get a shot at the console.
Tyrol, you and the Vice President
will stay at position one,
and provide covering fire for
both flanking maneuvers.
I have been given the opportunity to
perceive the scriptures more clearly.
Anything that impedes that,
I have to view as contrary to
the survival of the human species.
This is ridiculous.
Look, she obviously needs her medication.
I keep trying to tell anyone that'll listen.
Sounds like she's talking about
the scrolls of the Prophet Pythia.
I suppose.
Pythia foretold the rise of a leader.
A leader who would lead all
humanity to salvation.
So say the Gods.
Impedes that action...
You seem to know a lot
about the scriptures.
I'm from Gemenon. We believe in
the literal truth of the scriptures.
Contrary to the survival of the human...
Corporal Venner?
There's a, uh, a drug that
priests sometimes use.
It's called chamalla extract.
- Guess it's happy hour.
- What's happy about it?
The old man is still in surgery.
And I got a boatload of politicians
and press demanding to see Laura Roslin.
- Let 'em.
- Yeah, right.
- She's crazy.
- I know.
No, no. Really, Saul.
She's lost it. I just went
down to the brig to see her.
- You did?
- She's...
completely nuts.
She doesn't even know
where she is anymore.
- You're kidding.
- You should let 'em see her.
The press, the Quorum.
All of 'em.
I mean, the little schoolteacher's
mind has gone bye-bye.
And the Vice President is
either missing or dead.
That leaves you in unchallenged
command of this ship.
- And this fleet. - Just until the
old man gets back on his feet.
Well, of course.
Galactica, Apollo. We are
preparing to jump to Kobol.
Roger that, Apollo.
You are clear to jump.
And good hunting.
Thank you, Galactica.
Let's go find our people.
Okay, cock the rifle,
click the safety, open the scope.
Okay, cock the rifle,
click the safety, open the scope.
One of you will turn against the others.
- During the mission?
- Yes.
- One of us will betray the others?
- Yes.
- During the attack?
- Yes.
But if the attack fails?
You'll die.
Not me.
I am God's instrument.
God turned his back on Kobol.
Turned his back on man and
the false Gods he worshiped.
What happens on Kobol is not his will.
Saddle up.
It's time to junk some toasters.
XO.
Combat.
Dualla here, Sir.
The Quorum is demanding to
see the former President.
They're being pretty adamant and
they're giving the sentries a hard time.
Uh, maybe we should tell them to
shove their demand
up their collective asses,
how about that?
Yes, Sir. I need
instructions for the sentries.
- They're asking how to respond.
- Tell them that they are going to get to see
what has become of their precious
President. You tell them that.
I got a transponder signal.
Definitely Colonial.
Trying to establish a lock.
Got it.
Northern hemisphere.
Looks like mountainous terrain.
There's a valley.
Take us out of orbit.
Signal Raptor Two to form up on us.
There they are.
All three of 'em, right where
they're supposed to be.
All right, people, this is it.
We're going in.
Cally, move up the tree-line
to point alpha.
El-tee, there's five Cylons
at the launch site.
What?
Something's wrong, isn't it?
Something's wrong with the plan...
Quiet down, There's nothing wrong.
There's just a couple Cylons that
we didn't account for.
That makes for seven Cylons.
Five here, and
two up at the dish.
Are you absolutely certain about
the two guards at the dish?
I know what I saw.
Maybe there are only five Cylons.
They just changed their deployment.
They brought the two that
were guarding the dish down here.
Now the dish is unprotected.
Gods, Chief, that dish is,
like, almost a click away.
So what?
It's unprotected. We can go take it out.
We don't have to take on
the whole Cylon army.
- What the hell was that?
- Sonic booms.
Spacecraft entering
the upper atmosphere.
It's the SAR mission. They're here.
They are right up there, Chief.
We gotta go.
There's no time for discussion.
All right, everyone, move out.
It's game time. We're taking these toasters
out before they kill any more of us.
- Cally, I said move.
- I can't.
What?
That's an order.
She doesn't have to.
We can just go take out the dish.
Cally, you have to move.
Cally, this is not a joke.
Go. This is not a game, Cally.
Go. We have people counting on us.
They're up there, Cally.
Move!
Listen to me. We still have time to
double back and take out the dish.
Shut up for a second. Cally, Cally.
Specialist. You have your orders.
I need you to go out there and
create a distraction now!
Move!
- Move!
- Lt.
There were only supposed to be
three Cylons and now there are five.
How are we supposed to
take on five Cylons?
Frak orders, frak court marshal.
Our people are up there.
We have to save them.
We don't have any time.
Move!
- I can't do it.
- I said move!
No!
Chief!
Put it down.
Put it down.
You're going out there, Cally.
You're going out there or
I'm gonna blow your brains out.
Right here, right now.
Put it down.
- Hey, El-Lee. Easy.
- Take it easy.
I'm gonna count to three.
This is crazy.
This is crazy!
One.
Put it down right now.
Oh, my Gods.
Listen to me!
Drop your weapon.
Two.
Three.
Fall back! Fall back!
Go! Go! Go!
Doc, Let's go!
Now you're a man.
- ETA?
- Five minutes!
Oh, Cally!
Doc! Gimme the launcher!
Gimme the launcher, Doc!
Come on!
Missiles!
There's a battery down there!
Evasive!
Break, break, break!
No lock. No lock!
They're not locking on us.
Chief.
Stay there!
Stay there!
Chief!
You're welcome.
- Viewing time at the zoo.
- Glad to see you hold the President...
- ...in such high esteem.
- Your day's gonna come, laughing boy.
Let's go.
I don't know, what to do.
All right, the show is over.
Let's give her some privacy.
Everybody out.
Let's go back to the ward room
and we'll, uh,
talk about the business of
how we proceed from here.
Thank you all for coming.
I have a statement I'd like to make.
The attempted military coup
against the lawful government of
the colonies is illegal, ill-advised and
clearly doomed to failure.
I have not resigned the Presidency and
I will fight this action with
everything at my command.
She's crazy, she's nuts. She thinks
she a prophet or some such nonsense.
Just hold on Colonel let her speak.
Just ask her, ask her, she'll tell you.
Just listen to her.
What was it, the uhh,
the Arrow of Apollo will open the uhh, the
Tomb of Artemis. Or some such nonsense.
Everything I've done is
consistent and logical.
We have found Kobol,
we have found the city of the Gods
and when we retrieve the arrow
we will open the tomb of Athena
and we find the road to Earth.
Madam President, have you
read the Scrolls of Pythia?
Many times, and I humbly
believe I am fulfilling the role
of the leader.
Okay, enough of this
nonsense, everyone out.
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.
Sarah. You represent Gemenon,
you know more about the scrolls and
the scriptures than anyone else here,
why don't you speak up?
The scrolls tell us that a dying
leader will lead us to salvation.
She's not dying.
She's crazy.
I am dying.
I have terminal breast cancer.
Dr. Cottle will verify the diagnosis.
I have a few months to live.
And in that time, I will lead
the people to salvation.
It is my sole purpose.
Praise be to the Gods.
Here is our salvation.
- Sergeant of the guard,
- Yes, Sir.
Remove these people from the brig and
escort them back to their shuttle.
Yes, Sir.
Thank you, Corporal.
Thank the Gods.
It's a hell of a butchers Bill, Chief.
How did Crashdown die?
Leading the charge.
He gave his life in the...
in the finest tradition of the service.
Yeah. He was a hero.
To the end.
I'm so proud of you Gaius.
Why?
- 'Cause I've taken a life?
- It's what makes you human.
Is it?
Not conscious thought?
Not poetry or art or music, literature?
Murder.
Murder is my heritage.
Is that the lesson I'm supposed to
pass on to our child?
Shh. It'll be all right, Gaius.
Okay, Doctor, let's go!
Doctor, come on!
We gotta go.
I'll be your conscience.
Come on, Doctor!
We gotta get outta here!
He'll live.
When will he wake up?
Knowing him, when he damn well
wants to, probably.
I really frakked things up for you, Bill.
The events which took place aboard
Colonial one are unfortunate.
Laura Roslin's actions in
suborning mutiny and
sedition among the military
could not be tolerated.
Therefore Commander Adama was left with no
choice other than to remove her from office.
Miss Roslin is now resting comfortably
aboard this ship,
where she will remain until such time
as the Commander deems otherwise.
As it appears obvious that
the government cannot function
under the current circumstances,
I have decided to dissolve
the Quorum of Twelve.
And as of this moment,
I have declared martial law.
- Get those people the hell off my ship.
- Yes, Sir.
The Cylons were created by man.
They evolved.
They rebelled.
There are many copies.
And they have a plan.
Previously on Battlestar Galactica:
Congratulations, Doctor.
You've just uncovered your very first Cylon.
I'm not a Cylon.
This isn't happening.
I've been here for months.
By myself, on the run.
One step ahead of the Cylons.
You're going out there or I'm
gonna blow your brains out.
Right here, right now.
How did Crashdown die?
He gave his life in the...
in the finest tradition of the service.
You have my parole.
When I'm on duty, I'll make no attempt
to free her or sow insurrection
among the crew.
And when I'm not on duty,
I'll report directly back to this cell.
I have a few months to live.
And in that time,
I will lead the people to salvation.
It is my sole purpose.
As it appears obvious that the
government cannot function
under the current circumstances,
I have decided to dissolve
the Quorum of Twelve.
And as of this moment,
I have declared martial law.
You're sweating.
It's hot in here.
How long have you known
lieutenant Valerii was planning
to assassinate Commander Adama?
I had no idea she was
planning anything of the kind.
You were frakking her!
I ended that weeks ago,
on your orders.
You covered for her,
you lied for her.
- I admit I used bad judgment.
- You protected her at every turn.
Colonel, I had no idea she was a Cylon.
I'd like to exercise my article
21 rights at this time.
Oh, I'm sure you would.
I guess you haven't heard.
Cylons don't have rights.
- Cylon? Wait a minute.
- You know what we do with Cylons, Chief?
- I'm not a Cylon.
- Roslin came up with the execution method.
- I'm Galen Tyrol!
- She put a Cylon out of the airlock.
My father was a priest!
My mother was an oracle.
I've served on Battlestars
since I was 18 years old.
Pegasus, Columbia,
Atlantia, Galactica.
Don't talk to me like you're
a soldier!
You are not a soldier!
The old man always had a soft spot for you.
Let him decide what to do with you.
Colonel, you gotta believe me.
I am not a Cylon.
I'd never do anything to hurt Adama.
I love the old man.
That's what your girlfriend said.
Get him the hell out of here!
Chief?
I thought you were on Kobol.
Don't... you... talk to me.
Don't come near me.
Don't touch me.
If you do, I swear...
I will kill you.
Cylon-occupied Caprica
No sign of Centurions on the perimeter.
I don't like it. The human
toasters don't go anywhere alone.
- Think they're bait?
- Well, a pair of Cylons
don't just drive up here
in broad daylight.
Not after we hit that
convoy last week.
Frakkin'-A.
All right, screw it.
Pass word for everybody to sight in.
I wanna blow these Cylons away
before they ever knew what hit them.
Got it.
Unh! We gotta figure out
where the hell we are.
Why? You don't know?
You're the navigator.
You were driving.
Resistance
En subs by Laddin
bsg-cz.net
47,861 survivors
In search of a home.
Called Earth.
Earth.
All right we can head towards Gups' Point.
There's an emergency airstrip there.
No.
I've been.
I was thinking we could
head southwest.
Did you hear that?
- Drive through a lot of bad neighbourhoods?
- Better safe than sorry.
I hear that.
- We're sitting ducks down here!
- You go, I'll cover!
- Why me?
- Don't start!
Fine!
- You ready?
- Yeah.
Go!
Five of them, split up between
nine and one. 50 meters.
Ready?
Go!
Didn't see any shiny
silver out there.
I think we're dealing with
the human variety.
Hope so... they're not as
tough as mechanicals.
They do bleed good, though.
You gotta like that.
Let's get out of here!
Come on!
They locked the Chief up with Boomer.
Tigh thinks he's a Cylon.
I know.
I'm gonna see the Colonel now.
I think he wants me to find
a way to clear the Chief. Or...
Or what? Throw him out the airlock
like a piece of garbage?
If Commander Adama were in charge,
this would never happen.
Yes, but he's not in charge, is he?
No, but I've known the Chief for years.
He's no toaster.
He was involved with Lieutenant Valerii,
who most certainly is a toaster.
That word is racist.
I don't like it.
Sure... he's shown some bad
judgment getting involved with her,
but that doesn't mean he's a toaster.
- You've got to help him.
- Say something, Gaius.
Tell her you won't have racial
epithets used in your presence.
I'm very sorry. I was gonna tell
the Colonel there's nothing I can do.
The Cylon detector I developed doesn't work.
Clearly.
No!
You've got to help him.
Your child's gonna be half toaster.
How does that make you feel?
Nothing could make me happier.
I just don't know what I'd possibly say.
Excuse me.
He helped you!
He didn't tell anyone what
you did on Kobol.
What you did to Crashdown.
What I did to Crashdown
saved your life.
Are you blackmailing me?
Help the Chief to help
yourself, Doctor.
Yes, Doctor. That's what
you're best at, isn't it?
- Deck log.
- What the hell's the matter
with your Cylon detector, Doctor?
You gave the assassin a pass.
Yes, but that was a beta test, a preliminary.
Clearly I hadn't perfected my methodology,
- and she slipped through.
- Fuel report.
So that the hell are you telling me here?
That we are back to square one?
That no one's results are definitive?
That we have no way
of knowing who are the
Cylons among us?
No, I'm saying that since Valerii's te--
since the assassin's test, I've
developed a new set of protocols which
should eliminate any errors...
anomalies, that cropped up earlier--
If you let me test the Chief's blood,
I might be able to tell once and for all if--
No "if". I want a definitive answer.
No more of your weasely techno babble.
He's a Cylon or he's not. So get down
there and do something right for a change.
I am the Vice President.
Legally speaking, if the
President is incapacitated,
shouldn't I take over her duties--
Legally speaking,
I have declared martial law.
That makes you nobody.
So... unless you want to
join Roslin in the brig,
I suggest you get to work.
It's good to see you, Colonel.
Aren't you getting tired
of the continuous humiliation?
The disrespect from mechanics
and Colonels alike?
What do you think?
Maybe it's time to do something about it.
- What is this?
- The fleet Captains
are reporting protests among the civilians.
Demonstrations, petitions,
even some civil disobedience.
All over the declaration
of martial law.
Sir, there's more.
The Aturian refining vessel
has stopped refining tylium.
They say if they don't have
a voice in the government--
What?!
Their captain says they'll send fuel once
the civilian government has been restored.
And three other ships are
also refusing to resupply Galactica
until the President's reinstated.
And I got a note from combat warning
about problems with tylium resupply.
So watch your fuel burn
till further notice.
- Questions? - Yeah, when you
coming back to the card game?
I'm afraid when I'm off duty I'll be
enjoying the intimate surroundings
of the brig until...
ah, well, until further notice.
Come on back.
We miss you, Captain.
- We could bring the game to you.
- Somehow I doubt Colonel Tigh would approve.
Oh come on.
Hey, all right, all right.
Hey! Knock it off!
- Morning, Sir.
- Sergeant.
Shall we?
- Morning, Sir.
- Morning, Dee.
- Fancy meeting you here.
- I was just on my way, Sir.
- Hey, guys.
- How's it going, Dee?
Good, thanks.
- How's my father today?
- Uh, Commander Adama's the same... Captain.
He's sedated. Resting comfortably
since the surgery.
Trouble brewing in the fleet, though.
Oh, I'm shocked.
What kind of trouble?
Martial law isn't going
down too well.
Protests, demonstrations.
Some ships are even refusing
to resupply Galactica.
And this is the honeymoon period.
What's a dictator to do?
I, um, I wish...
I wish you were in command, Sir.
Dee...
He's hitting the bottle.
A lot.
Thank you for the company,
Petty Officer Dualla.
You're welcome, Sir.
- You okay, baby?
- No, I'm not okay.
My head feels like it's gonna
roll off my shoulders.
- What are you working on?
- I'm trying to figure out how to
solve our resupply problem now
that half the fleet has gone out on strike.
- You serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.
I should probably call a summit
sit-down with all our ships' captains
and explain the situation and tell
them why I had to declare martial law.
Screw them. Like you have to
explain yourself to them.
It wouldn't hurt.
It would cool things down a little.
What?
Nothing.
No, no, no, it's...
you're the boss. Far be it from me to tell
you how to do your job.
- I know that's one of your issues.
- Just say it.
I don't know, it just feels
kind of... touchy-feely
You know, "Let's all sit
down and talk about how
we feel about martial law."
Bill would never do that.
But you gotta do what you gotta do.
I mean, Bill may never get
on his feet again.
Honey... honey, you handle
this the way you want.
They'll respect that.
Eventually.
This is the XO. Mr. Gaeta, send the
following to all ships' captains
Message begins: Resupply operations
of this ship are not, repeat, not optional.
All ships to recommence scheduled
supply runs immediately.
Failure to comply will result
in... stern measures.
Message ends.
You happy now?
- I'll fake.
- I'll draw fire.
Hi.
We're not Cylons.
Right. You're human.
You have a soul.
You swim in the stream.
We heard it all before.
Hey, colonial fleet.
Notice the uniforms?
Yeah, right, we've seen
Cylons in uniform before.
- We're human.
- Yeah, right.
- Everyone on Caprica is dead.
- You're not.
I just got here.
I want to hear some names.
I'm Anders.
- Samuel T. Anders?
- Yeah, that's right.
This is Jo-man, Rally, Ten-point...
Sue-Shaun, Crip-Key, Morris Fink.
Kara, these are the Caprica Buccaneers.
- Hmm. I don't think so.
- Give me a ball, little girl.
I'll shove it up your ass.
Please... try.
Okay,
since we're all getting along so well,
can people stop pointing their guns at us.
How does a professional pyramid
team survive a nuclear holocaust?
We were in the mountains when the
Cylons attacked. High altitude training.
We've been on the run ever since.
- Doing what?
- Raiding military stores
for ammo. Anti-radiation meds.
And plugging toasters whenever
they show up.
- Same as us.
- Okay...
how many foul breaks did you
have in the playoff against Aerilon?
- You're kidding, right?
- You either have the answer,
or you have a bullet.
Three.
Wrong.
- Four.
- Three.
Three. Last one was called
back on instant replay.
He's right, Starbuck.
I lost 20 cubits on that game.
Fine.
For now.
on three.
1.
2.
3.
You know you guys suck, right?
Can't shoot, can't pass.
Sure as hell can't take the point.
Everyone's a critic.
Here's your, uh, medication,
Madame President.
And a little something from the galley.
Thank you, Corporal Venner.
Chamalla and liquorice.
Would you like some?
- I hate liquorice.
- Me too.
It's interesting he still
calls you Madame President.
You still have a lot of
supporters out there.
Something ugly is coming.
I can feel it.
Sir, refinery captain's still not
cooperating. And now seven
other container ships are
refusing to release their supplies.
- Food, medicine, even coffee.
- Coffee?
This is getting ridiculous.
Frak this. It's time to get their attention.
I'm sending in the marines.
I want a Raptor and an armed marine
boarding party for every ship
refusing the resupply order.
Sir, we're stretched pretty
thin on manpower.
I'm not sure we have enough marine non-coms
to command that many boarding parties, Sir.
Well, pull pilots and deck officers to
command the boarding parties if you have to.
Tell them to get over there and
bring back the supplies.
Whatever it takes.
- Make it happen, Lieutenant.
- Yes, Sir.
Heavy Hauler Transport "Gideon"
People, step back, all right?!
We're just here for the supplies!
Galactica Boarding Party Six
Lt. Joe "Hammerhead" Palladino, Commanding
Just stay out of the way
and no one gets hurt!
For the last
time, step back!
Step back!
Cease fire!
Cease fire!
Four civilian dead. How the frak
could this have happened?
What'd you expect, genius? You put
a pilot in charge of crowd control.
Palladino! Did you give the order
to shoot on that crowd?
No, Sir, of course not.
The crowd surrounded us.
- Were they armed?
- No, Sir, but...
you had to be there. They were
yelling and screaming at us,
and then it got violent.
They started throwing things,
canisters.
- Coffee, I think.
- Coffee?
You shot people for
throwing coffee?
The crowd was out of control.
They were pressing in on us.
My men were getting hurt.
Somebody took a shot.
I don't know who it was.
Then all hell broke loose.
If ever we needed you, Bill,
it's right now.
Troops shooting unarmed civilians.
This is a travesty.
He has truly stepped over the line.
It'll cause an explosion in the fleet.
The press will have a field day.
The ships would begin to splinter.
The Cylons will be able to eliminate
us a few ships at a time.
We've got to get out of here now.
- Corporal.
- I am right with you.
I'm so glad you said that.
I want to take Billy and Elosha with me.
Of course you do.
I've worked out a way of
getting us in the hangar deck.
And I can get us a Raptor.
But we're still gonna need
clearance to get off the ship.
- I know how to get that.
- You do?
Question is, where do we go
once we get off this ship?
We'll have to find some place to hide
in the fleet while we rally
support among the people.
I've got an idea about that.
You're not going to like it.
I'm not cut out for this.
I never was.
Don't talk like that, Saul.
This is your moment.
Me and Bill, side by side, that was the deal.
It was never supposed to be me alone.
Well, like it or not, you're in command,
so you better deal with it.
I don't want to deal with it.
I do not want to command.
Don't you get it?
Jeez, why do I listen to you?
What are you talk? I never told you
to send troops out to that ship.
No, no, you didn't tell me to
send troops anywhere.
You just manipulate. You always do.
You put the knife in, and you twist it.
Oh, right,
you're going to blame me
for your own inadequacy?
I'm not blaming you, Ellen.
you are so frakking passive that
if I didn't push you,
you would never get your head out
of that frakking bottle and do anything.
I warned you.
I'm telling you.
- I love you so much.
- Shut up, Ellen.
I guess you really must hate me.
I don't know if it makes any difference
right now, but I'm really sorry
you got pulled into this.
You know, what we had--
Was nothing.
Nothing.
You're a machine.
I'm not.
Well, whatever I am,
I know how I felt.
- Software doesn't have feelings.
- Open the cell.
I never meant to hurt you.
I'd like some privacy, please.
I'll be fine, thank you.
And how are we this evening?
What do you want?
I'm here to determine whether
you're a Cylon or not.
Your arm, please.
His test doesn't work too well.
I mean, he gave me the green light.
The test works...
just fine.
Chief?
Chief?
I lied to you, Sharon.
I covered up your true nature from
the rest of the fleet for my own purposes.
What did you do to him?
He's not breathing.
No, he's dying right now, Sharon.
I can save him
if you tell me how many Cylons
there are left in the fleet.
I don't know,
but I'm not getting a pulse.
Yes, you do. Now, buried
deep down in that thing you call
- a subconscious you know how many.
- I don't know!
He doesn't have time for this, Sharon.
His organs are shutting down.
In ten seconds time, he'll experience
complete brain stem death.
Now how many?
Do you love him, Sharon?
only you can save him!
10.
9.
do you love him?
Do you love him, Sharon?
Eight!
There are eight.
All right, let's get these
weapons unloaded. Let's go!
Hit an armory earlier today,
about 18 clicks north.
- Brought home a lot of toys.
- What is this place?
Delphi union high school.
Toasters don't patrol this area.
It's good place to get some
shut-eye, a bite to eat.
- How many people you have here?
- 53.
We had almost a hundred before the
toasters ambushed us last week.
Let's go!
- More pyramid teams?
- Nah, just us C-Bucs.
Rest are survivalists,
hikers mostly.
How's your stock of
anti-radiation masks?
Raided a couple of hospitals
down in Pilgrim Bay.
I figured we've got enough
for three months.
Let's get you some
bunk space, come on.
53...
Not exactly an army.
A hell of a lot better
than the two of us
if we're going to assault an airbase,
steal a heavy raider,
and get the frak off this planet.
I'll just be a moment.
Doctor...
I need your help.
But it's illegal, dangerous, and in
violation of your oath as
an officer.
You're a lousy salesman.
Corporal! Corporal Venner.
I, uh...
I just want to tell you how much the
President appreciates all the
little things you do for her.
Hey, anything I can do to
make things easier for her.
Great. She, um...
has a special request.
If I could just get your signature, Sir.
Why are we closing down Causeway B?
Integrity testing, Sir.
Got chewed up pretty bad when
the toasters boarded us.
And we've been getting some
pressure drops in there.
Tell 'em to get it fixed.
- Oh! Sorry.
- Lieutenant.
Things are pretty frakked up
these days, huh?
Yeah, things are pretty
frakked up most days.
If people are upset, they should
go through the proper channels.
- I'm not sure I understand what...
- I was running some maintenance checks,
detected a series of scrambled calls
going out over the past few hours.
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?
No, Sir. Off-log calls are against regs.
Hmm... that's right.
I'm sure you won't approve.
But I guess that's nothing new.
I just want you to know that this, um...
this isn't about you and me.
Good-bye, dad.
- You gonna help out here or what?
- They're putting the Chief in there,
you know?
I don't care if they put
a giant parakeet in here.
Colonel says build a cell,
we build a cell.
This isn't right.
He's one of us.
No, he's one of them.
He always was. We just never saw it.
No, he's innocent.
She tricked him.
Wow, such loyalty.
Were you frakking him too?
You want to get pissed at someone,
you get pissed at Boomer.
She's the one who put the
Chief in the cell here, not us.
- Evening, Sir.
- Evening, Dee.
Fancy meeting you here.
- Everything set?
- Roger that.
Sorry, captain.
Can't chit-chat today.
Captain!
I'm having trouble with the ordnance
tracking on my Raptor, Sir.
I can't get it to cycle.
Oh... change of plans, boys.
Instead of getting some rack time,
I going to take a minute to do
the Lieutenant's job for her.
- Yes, Sir.
- After you.
Okay, make it look good,
but not too good.
Hold it!
Private, do you know who I am?
Good.
You and I have something in common.
We each took an oath to protect
and defend the Articles of Colonization.
Those articles are under attack,
as is our entire democratic way of life.
Now, my duty won't let me stand
here and allow that to happen.
So I intend to go through that hatch
and get off this ship.
Damn it.
They should be here by now.
You can either stand aside,
or you can shoot me.
You'll have to decide where your duty lies.
Madame President...
Madame President, this way.
Madame President.
I'm not getting on that ship with you.
What?
I understand what you're trying to do.
But it's going to divide the fleet.
At the very best, it'll create
an insurgency against Adama.
And at the worst, a civil war.
Taking part in that is a line
that I won't cross.
We do not have a lot of time.
I wish you well.
Dustoff two-seven, checkers green,
ready for launch on medical mission.
Request clearance.
Good to see you. You okay?
I think so. My feet barely touched
the ground getting here.
I know what you mean.
Dustoff two-seven. Standard port three
departure approved. Cleared for launch.
Standard port three, wilco.
Sir. Corporal Venner reports
the former President's missing.
- Missing?
- Two men down, cell's empty.
Damn it.
Alert security.
Set condition two!
No one on or off the ship!
Attention, set condition two throughout
the ship. Repeat, set condition
two throughout the ship.
Sir. Flight log records a Raptor departed
the ship two minutes ago
with Doc Cottle on
a medical emergency.
Medical? Confirm that.
Dradis has their transponder
bearing 2-8-7 carom 0-0-3. Range 2-7.
Get the cap on the horn and have them
intercept. And get Captain Adama
out of the brig.
Sir, Dr. Cottle is still inboard.
He says he was forced
to request the Raptor at
gunpoint by Captain Adama.
Son of a bitch.
Dee, put me through to that Raptor.
Cap has visual on their target.
Turn that ship around, Apollo,
or I'll order the cap to shoot you down.
- We're not turning back.
- I'll do it.
Don't think I won't just because
you're the old man's son.
Then do what you have to do, Galactica.
Apollo out.
Fire across their bow.
Hot Dog, Galactica.
Fire across their bow.
- Acknowledge.
- Wilco, Galactica.
Hot Dog reports they're
not turning around, Sir.
- Where are they now?
- Dradis shows them approaching cloud nine.
Sir, if they dock, we may lose them.
Cloud Nine is one of the busiest
transport hubs in the fleet.
Shuttles coming and going constantly.
If they board one and take off,
it'll be before we can
shut down air traffic.
Galactica, Hot Dog.
Request instructions.
Galactica, Hot Dog.
I need further instructions.
Do I fire or not?
Dee... tell Hot Dog to hold his fire.
Repeat, weapons
hold. Do not fire.
Hot Dog, Galactica. Weapons hold.
Repeat, do not fire.
They couldn't have done
it on their own.
Did anybody notice off-log calls?
Scrambled communications?
No, Sir.
Nothing.
Well, we're home free for now.
Good to see you, Madame President.
Captain Apollo...
what is Mr. Zarek doing here?
Once Tigh gets over his initial shock,
he'll send troops out to search for us.
If we're going to make it, we have to keep
on the move. I figured Mr. Zarek here is
the only one in the fleet with enough shady
friends around who can possibly hide us.
Love the way he puts that.
Well, Mr. Zarek, it would seem the enemy
of my enemy is my friend.
Call me Tom.
Our shuttle's waiting, ma'am.
We have to hurry.
Wow, is that the best you can do?
Nice to know installing a regulation
pyramid court was one of the
priorities of the resistance.
Well, there are some things
one cannot live without.
Let's go.
Are you kidding me?
I'll wipe the court with you.
Yeah, we'll see about that.
I was scouted for the pros.
Bum knee took me out of contention.
I see.
Is that going to be your
excuse when I kick your ass?
- "My poor knee hurts."
- At least I have an excuse.
I can't imagine what
yours is going to be.
Nice shot.
Thanks.
Thanks. Thanks, doc.
I appreciate it.
Don't thank me.
Thank her.
Why, what does she
have to do with it?
Everything.
Nothing.
Love is a strange and
wonderful thing, Chief.
You'd be happy you experienced it at all.
Even if it was with a machine.
- What are they going to do to her?
- They're setting up a new holding facility.
There will be tests.
Mental.
Physical.
Like she's some kind of lab rat?
That's the idea.
This is just great.
Bill Adama's little baby boy
pulls the wool over your eyes,
and you let him get away Scot-free.
You're a laughing stock.
You didn't want this command.
Well, don't worry about it.
You won't have it for much longer.
All because when push came to shove,
you got shoved.
It was his son.
What's happening on my ship?
Wait in the corridor.
Ellen, can I speak to my XO?
Of course.
Slowly.
What's happened?
I frakked things up and good.
- How?
- I made some bad calls.
- I've done that.
- Not like these.
You gonna pour us one
of those or what?
Never had much use for people
who second-guessed my decisions.
Especially if they've never held a command.
They don't understand the pressure.
You make a call.
It affects the lives of thousands.
And you have no one to
turn to for back-up.
Well, you make it look easy.
Well, you know that's a lie now.
A lot of pieces to pick up.
Then we'll pick 'em up together.
Where's my son?
Bitch!
Traitor!
No, no, no.
I love you, Chief.

The Farm
Previously
on Battlestar Galactica:
I have a few months to live.
And in that time I will lead
the people to salvation.
It is my sole purpose.
Praise be to the gods.
Here is our salvation.
Laura Roslin's actions
in suborning mutiny
and sedition among the military
could not be tolerated.
Therefore Commander Adama
was left with no choice
other then to remove her
from office.
I've gotta get out of here now.
I'm right with you.
I think these guys
might really be human.
Everyone on Caprica is dead.
You're not.
I just got here.
Not exactly an army.
A hell of a lot better
than the two of us
if we're gonna assault
an air base, steal heavy radar,
and get the frak
off this planet.
Nice to know installing
a regulation pyramid court
was one of the priorities
of the resistance.
Nice shot.
Thanks.
Stand aside,
or you can shoot me.
I intend to go through that
hatch and get off this ship.
The former president's
missing.
- Missing?
- Two men down. Cell's empty.
Damn it.
We're home free for now.
Glad to see you,
Madam President.
Zarek here is the only one
with enough shady friends around
who can possibly hide us.
Cally shot Boomer.
No, no, no.
I love you, Chief.
What's happening on my ship?
I frakked things up, and good.
I made some bad calls.
A lot of pieces to pick up.
Then we'll pick 'em up together.
You've been awake
for an hour.
So what are you gonna do if you
can't make it back to your ship?
I'm getting back.
Well, I know we were able to
take your sorry ass by surprise.
Frak you.
Nice.
But the truth is...
we really don't know
what the hell we're doing.
A lot of our tactics and stuff
we just saw in the movies.
We could use
some professional advice.
You want some advice?
You're on the losing end
of this fight.
Give it up before you all die.
Head further up
in the mountains
above the ambient radiation
and just hole up.
And what?
Wait to die?
As soon as I get back
to Galactica
I'll send a rescue party.
Yeah, right.
If I say I'm gonna do something,
I do it.
You always such a bitch
in the morning?
Count on it.
My kinda woman.
We have a mission
to accomplish.
So what.
Mission.
Fine.
Whatever.
I'm sorry, okay?
I didn't mean to--
Gotcha.
So weak.
So, so very weak.
Lighten up a little bit.
It's only the end
of the world.
Sue-Shaun, I want them
to watch our perimeter,
especially on the flank.
Okay.
The Cylons have
a refueling airstrip
just on the side
of the ridge.
There's a heavy raider
makes a regular refueling stop
every afternoon like clockwork.
Machines like routine.
It's usually guarded
by less than three
of the mechanical varieties,
and we've left it alone
up until now.
So?
What's the plan?
Go through this gully.
Approach the airstrip
from the south side.
Sprinkle our men
through the tree line
and wait for the Cylons
to land the raider.
Hook up the refueling hoses.
Once they hook up
the tylium hoses,
we take out the guards
and blow
the refueling station.
I thought you wanted
the raider intact.
They build 'em tough.
Believe me.
Blowing the fuel will barely
put a scratch in the hull,
but it might give us
enough time to board.
Once I'm inside,
I'll blow the brain,
and I'll start working
on trying to get it to--

Season 02 EP 05
The Farm
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'm glad to be back.
There are things
we don't say often enough.
Things like what we mean
to one another.
All of you
mean a lot to me.
I just want you to know that.
Let's get back to work.
Feel strange.
Like, closer to the ground.
You should check in
with the doctor.
Mr. Gaeta?
Where do you think
they are now?
The stolen Raptor with Captain
Adama, the former president--
The fugitives.
The fugitives docked
at Cloud Nine last week.
We effectively lost them
at that point
due to the large volume
of inter-fleet traffic
going to and from Cloud Nine.
Right now they could be holed up
anywhere in the fleet.
I want them found.
She was dangerous enough
as a symbol of resistance,
but now with Lee helping...
I want to search
every ship in the fleet.
Quarantine procedures.
Isolate the ship
out of the main body.
If it's clean,
we keep it quarantined
away from the rest
of the fleet.
She can hide,
but she can't run.
Start quarantine procedures.
Start with Cloud Nine.
How much longer are we meant
to stay hidden
in this meat locker?
I've communicated
your latest message
to the Quorum of Twelve.
And they've decided
that the question
of openly supporting you
needs more... deliberation.
I need to make an appeal
to the people.
Make a strong enough argument
and the Astral Queen
will be the first ship in line.
Like they do anything but roll
over and take orders from you.
One more bit of news
I should convey,
Zeus has returned to Olympus.
Adama's back in command.
My father?
He's back?
Word just came in
over the wireless.
He's a tough
old bird.
What we really need
is something heartfelt.
Something human
and personal
that will galvanize
the people.
Like a son
denouncing his father.
My name is Lee Adama.
Until recently
I was the commander
of Galactica's Air Group.
But when Commander Adama,
my father,
decided to stage a military
coup against the president,
I could no longer support him
or his actions.
I love my father.
I respect him.
But in this,
he is wrong.
He must be opposed.
I call on all free-thinking
people in the fleet--
I can't do this.
Sorry, everyone.
I thought I could, but I can't.
I'm playing
the religious card.
I know exactly
what I have to do.
How does this thing work?
Shhh.
You're okay.
You're in an aid hospital.
They brought you in
yesterday morning.
You got shot
in the abdomen.
I'm Simon.
Can you tell me your name?
Kara.
Kara Thrace.
Good.
You were in surgery
for about two hours.
I removed the bullet.
I didn't think you were gonna
make it there for a while.
Take it easy.
I know that hurts.
Who brought me in?
A big guy named Anders.
Used to be a pro pyramid player,
if you can believe that.
Yeah, I know him.
Where is he?
He died...
on the table.
I thought he was
only slightly wounded.
Turns out a piece of shrapnel
had nicked his aorta.
Massive internal bleeding.
I'm sorry.
We did everything we could do.
Morning.
I see you're sucking down
fluids at a rapid pace.
That's good.
Are you a Cylon?
What do you think?
I think you didn't answer
the question.
I am most definitely
not a Cylon.
Of course I don't know what
you'd expect me to say.
If I was a Cylon,
I certainly wouldn't admit it.
Can I leave?
There's the door.
Frakkin' doctors.
So I am a doctor.
Not a Cylon.
The jury's still out.
I would expect the Cylons
to have better digs
than this, though.
Where is this rat trap?
We're about 20 klicks
north of Delphi.
Used to be a mental institution.
It's not much, but it's one
of the few places
the Cylons haven't found yet.
Okay.
So, what,
I'm supposed to believe
there really is
a resistance out there?
Shhh, don't tell anybody.
We're trying
to keep that quiet.
Time for your pain meds.
If I may speak on behalf
of Specialist Cally.
She was distraught, sir.
The experience on Kobol.
Being on the surface
fighting the Cylons,
it's shattering
for all of us.
I don't believe that she was
in her right mind
when she shot Boomer.
Did you love her, Chief?
Excuse me?
Boomer-- did you love her?
I thought I did.
When you think you
love somebody, you love them.
That's what love is-- thoughts.
She was a Cylon.
A machine.
Is that what Boomer was?
A machine?
A thing.
That's what she
turned out to be.
She was more
than that to us.
She was more than that to me.
She was a vital,
living person...
aboard my ship
for almost two years.
She couldn't have been
just a machine.
Could you love a machine?
No, sir.
I guess I couldn't have.
Cally discharged a firearm
with no permission,
endangering
her fellow shipmates.
30 days in the brig.
Dismissed.
Thank you, sir.
You'll see her again, Chief.
Excuse me?
There are many copies.
You'll see her again.
How many patients
do you have here?
Am I being
interrogated again?
I just think it's odd that
I've been here for two days,
and I haven't seen
anybody else.
Just you.
We have 223 patients
at the moment.
Two doctors and five teachers
masquerading as nurses.
I knew a teacher
masquerading as president.
What's that?
It's awfully quiet.
No screams, no moans.
No,"Doctor, Doctor,
please help me.
It hurts."
Most of our patients
are succumbing
to acute radiation
poisoning.
Symptoms include powerful
fatigue and immediate nausea.
This is followed by several days
of comparable well-being.
After that, cell death
in the gastric
and intestinal tissue
causes massive diarrhea,
intestinal bleeding,
and loss of water.
It's not pretty.
But it is... quiet.
The biggest killer
in this place is infection.
That's why we have you
under quarantine.
We don't know what you
brought in with you yet.
Your test results will be back
this afternoon.
Okay.
Almost done.
I think there may be a cyst
on one of your ovaries.
Is it serious?
Nah, it should be fine.
We'll keep an eye on it.
Gotta keep that reproductive
system in great shape.
It's your most valuable asset
these days.
Right.
I'm serious.
Finding healthy child-bearing
women your age
is a top priority
for the resistance.
And you'll be happy to know
that you are
a very precious commodity to us.
I am not a commodity.
I'm a viper pilot.
Do you see any vipers
around here?
I mean, you do realize that
you're one of the handful
of women left on this planet
actually capable
of having children.
Right? I mean, that is your
most valuable skill right now.
Well, I don't want a child.
So just drop it, okay?
Well, no one's forcing you.
Just take a moment
and think about...
where you are
and what's going on.
The human race
is on the verge of extinction.
And to be quite frank
with you, potential mothers
are a lot more valuable
right now
than a whole squadron
of viper pilots.
I shouldn't
have mentioned it.
I should have known
you'd be sensitive.
A lot of women
with your history
forego bearing children
of their own.
My history?
I saw the fractures
on your x-rays.
A lot of old fractures
from childhood.
It's interesting
how you managed to break
every finger on both hands.
Every break
in the exact same place,
between the first
and the second knuckle.
Did someone break
your fingers, Kara?
Get out.
Children of abusive parents
often fear passing along
that abuse
to their own children.
Get out!
Is she kidding with this?
I know it's hard to believe,
but that message
has cropped up
all over the fleet.
It's religious crap.
"It seems I have been chosen
to help lead you
"to the promised land
of Earth.
"I will not question
this choice,
"I will simply try
to play my part in the plan.
"Therefore,
at the appointed hour,
"I will give a signal
to the fleet.
"All those wishing
to honor the gods
"and walk the path of destiny
"will follow me back to Kobol.
"It is there that we will meet
the gods' servant
with the Arrow of Apollo."
We've got five Raptors with
marine fire teams standing by
to board the Astral Queen.
No one's gonna follow her.
No one's going
to believe this crap.
No one's this stupid.
And anyone that is,
that wants to make
a suicide run to Kobol...
please let them.
Two minutes.
Any other ships declared
themselves for us?
Not yet.
Oh, no, that-- no.
Please, this isn't necessary.
Give them your blessing.
Oh, no.
It's not right.
This isn't who I am.
Laura, this is your path.
The one the gods picked
for you.
The one you picked
for yourself.
Anders, we musta been over
this line ten times already.
She must have taken
a bullet.
She was right here
by the vehicles.
Okay, she would have got up and
crawled the frak out of here.
Hey, we have to search
the entire area again.
I told you we shouldn't have
pulled back so fast.
I thought she was with us.
Anders, we got ambushed.
Okay, we all got separated.
There's nothing we could
have done about it.
Kara, of all people,
would understand.
Let's just find her.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I know where Starbuck is.
Sharon?
Where have you been?
Tracking you.
Who is she?
She's with us.
You're the father
of my child, Helo,
I'm not gonna lose you.
Where is she?
We're ready.
Send the signal and Jump.
Astral Queen has jumped away.
Now see how many follow.
To sit around
and wait for Starbuck to show up
with that stupid arrow?
Two.
Three at the most.
Good morning.
You look better.
What's this new scar?
They had to go
back in last night
while you were asleep.
Some internal bleeding
to tie up.
Nothing to worry about.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Just about done
with you, Starbuck.
Nice way of puttin' it.
Just a few more tests.
And--
I almost said we'll
be sending you back home.
I guess we'll be sending you
back into the fight.
Sounds good to me.
Hey, I just woke up.
Now you're going
back to sleep.
You're the doc.
Ahhh.
Pending lab test results
on sample ovaries,
complete removal
will proceed tomorrow.
If lab tests are positive,
then subject will be removed
to processing facility
for final disposition.
Is that regret I hear
in your voice, Simon?
If it is, it certainly
is none of your concern.
Lords of Kobol,
please help me.
Morning.
Are you sure
you're feeling okay?
You know, something actually
has been bothering me lately.
Ahhh!
I never told you
my call sign was Starbuck.
You can't kill me.
Just die!
Sue-Shaun.
Sue-Shaun,
it's me-- Kara.
Hold on, okay?
I'm gonna get you outta here.
No.
No time.
Cut the power.
It'll kill you.
Can't live like this.
The baby machines.
Please.
Please.
Ahh!
Kara, come on!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Go! Go! Go!
Get down!
Kara, get down!
Let's go!
Let's go!
We gotta go!
Hey.
Come on!
Move like you have
a purpose, people.
Let's go, go, go, go!
24 ships, sir.
That's almost a third
of the fleet.
Why?
Why?
They were conducting research
into Human/Cylon
breeding programs.
Human/Cylon?
They call them farms.
Your gunshot wound
looks fine.
So farms, that's great.
What were they gonna do?
Knock me up with some Cylon kid?
They were gonna try to.
We haven't been
very successful so far.
Supposedly they can't reproduce.
You know, biologically.
So they've been trying every
which way to produce offspring.
Why?
Procreation, it's one of God's
commandments, be fruitful.
We can't fulfill it.
We've tried.
So we decided to--
To rape human women.
You know, if you agreed
to bear children,
it'd be voluntary,
maybe even set you up
with someone you like.
Like you two kids?
We're different.
What the frak
is that supposed to mean?
They have this theory.
Maybe the one thing
they were missing was love.
So Sharon and I...
we were set up to--
To fall in love?
They didn't ask Sue-Shaun if she
wanted to fall in love, right?
They put a tube in her!
And they hooked her up
to a machine!
They know who you are, Kara.
You're special.
Leoben told you that.
You have a destiny.
Starbuck, what's
this second scar?
I don't know.
I'm not sure I wanna know now.
You know?
No.
How many women do they have
at these farms?
Hundreds...
Maybe thousands.
I don't know.
I haven't accessed that data.
Here's what we do.
Take the Heavy Raider,
cram it full of ground troops,
find out where the next farm is,
liberate it,
then the next
and the next and the next.
No, no, no, no, that's not why
you came to Caprica.
Go find Earth.
What about you?
You said you needed
professional advice.
We'll muddle through.
We've managed so far.
They'll kill you.
You'll die here.
You know that.
A lot of people died here.
I tell you this.
If I'm gonna die here,
I'm gonna take out
every last one
of those frakkin' farms
before I do.
I'm not gonna leave you here.
Well...
you said you were gonna
come back, remember?
I'm gonna hold you to it.
I'm coming back.
I said it.
I meant it.
Yeah, okay.
Hey...
Be safe.
Let's go home.

The Farm
Cylonce su stvorili ljudi
Evoluirali su
Pobunili su se
Postoje mnoge kopije
I imaju plan
Već viđeno
Koliko je cylonaca u floti?
8! Ima ih 8!
Razvodnik Venner prijavljuje da
je bivša predsjednica nestala.
- Nestala?
- 2 čovjeka su u nesvijesti, a ćelija prazna.
Prokletstvo.
Lijepo vas je vidjeti, predsjednice.
Pa, gdine Zarek, izgleda da je neprijatelj
moga neprijatelja moj prijatelj.
Nađi Zemlju.
Idemo kući.
Našli smo Kobol,
i kad povratimo strijelu,
otvorit ćemo Ateninu
grobnicu i naći put do Zemlje.
Nitko neće povjerovat u to sranje.
A ako itko želi počiniti
samoubojstvo i otići na Kobol...
pusti ga.
Astralna Kraljica je skočila.
24 broda, gdine.
Gotovo trećina flote.
Slijedit će Roslinku na Kobol,
pravo u smrt.
18000 duša na 24 broda
su se pridružili pobuni
predsjednice Roslin, gdine.
- To je gotovo trećina ljudstva.
- Daj mi sažetak.
Što smo izgubili?
9500 ljudi sa Gemenona.
- 6250 sa Caprice.
- Ne koga.
Što?
Ne zanimaju me ljudi koji su odlučili
pridružiti se religioznom fanatiku i teroristu.
To je njihova stvar.
Dakle, što smo izgubili?
12 transportera, 7 tegljača,
3 konstrukcijske platforme,
privatnu letjelicu i
rudarski brod, gdine.
Gubljenje Monarha je udarac.
Ne možemo si priuštiti gubljenje
rudarskog broda, ne u našoj situaciji.
A tu je i posredna šteta.
Moral u floti opada.
Novinari će podivljati.
- Obitelji su razdvojene.
- Ne govori mi o obitelji.
Potpuno podržavam predsjednicu.
I moji prioriteti su njezina sigurnost
i završetak ovog zadatka.
To je sve dobro, ali on
je još uvijek Adamin sin.
Kad zagusti, kako znamo
da će ostati uz nas?
Da nije bilo njega, još bih
bila u zatvoru na Galactici.
Potpuno mu vjerujem. I
time zatvaram tu temu.
A što ćemo s Galacticom?
Sa njima? Oni znaju gdje smo!
Mogu svaki tren skočiti amo
i optužiti nas za izdaju,
ili nas zgnječiti poput muha.
Nismo bez obrane!
Neki naši brodovi su naoružani!
I trebali bi naoružati i
ostale, za svaki slučaj.
Za slučaj...da poželimo
napraviti kolektivno samoubojstvo!
Ako nas Galactica želi srušiti,
ništa je ne može spriječiti, ništa.
I nitko u ovoj sobi ne bi trebao gajiti
iluzije da stvari stoje drugačije.
Trenutno, čvrsto vjerujem da nas je
zapovjednik Adama odlučio pustiti.
Poručnica Thrace će se vratiti.
Donijet će Apolovu strijelu.
I ona će nam pomoći na
našem putu prema Zemlji.
I koliko dugo ćemo je čekati?
Možda bi trebali se odmah
spustiti na površinu.
- Poći dolje i tražiti grobnicu.
- Ja se ne bih tako žurio.
Možda još ima cylonaca dolje.
I neki od nas će dolje poginuti.
Sveti tekstovi kažu da svaki
povratak na Kobol nosi cijenu...
u krvi.
Ljudi....
Znam da ima mnogo neodgovorenih pitanja.
Ali nipošto ne želim izgubiti
iz vida o čemu se ovdje radi:
o našoj misiji spašavanja Čovjeka.
Da, to je velika misija.
Ali to je naša proreknuta
sudbina. I ja, za početak,
ja neću pokleknuti pred tim sada.
Ako netko ovdje misli da
nema jaja za ovu misiju,
slobodan je da ode i vrati
se u flotu zapovjednika Adame.
Iskočilo je na dradisu prije 2 minuta.
Nema kolonijalni odašiljač, i prevelik
je da bude Karin cylonski lovac.
- I ne odgovara na naše pozive?
- Ni šapatom, Tome.
Ili je cylonac, ili
izviđački raptor sa Galactice.
U svakom slučaju, prvo pucajmo
pa onda postavljajmo pitanja.
Adriatik ga ima u dosegu naoružanja,
a on nosi protubrodske rakete.
Tome, ta se stvar brzo približava.
Ako mislimo pucati, učinimo to odmah!
Pucati na što?
Moram li ponavljati?
Gdjo predsjednice, imamo
sigurnosni problem. To je sve.
Nije tebe pitala.
Neidentificirani brod nam se približava.
Prevelik je da bude
poručnicin cylonski lovac.
U dometu je. Adriatik sada mora pucati.
Treba nam odluka, gdjo predsjednice.
Civilni brode, ovdje Starbuck.
Čujete li me?
Čujete li me? Ponavljam, ovdje Starbuck.
Čuje li me itko?
Halo?
Počni sa slijetanjem.
Lijepo vas je vidjeti, kapetane.
Podsjeti me poslije da
te pošaljem u zatvor.
Poručniče.
Lee, moram ti nešto reći.
Lee, čekaj!
Da se nisi makla!
Stani! Ona je sa nama!
Spustite oružje, gdine.
Spustite oružje.

Gospodo, ovo ću reći samo jednom.
Kapetane Adama, i...kako se zovete?
Poručnik Agathon.
Bio je Sharonin partner.
Mislio sam da si mrtav, Helo.
Jesi i ti cylonac?
- Ni ne počinji.
- OK, ovo ćemo napraviti.
Svi ćete spustiti
oružje. Jesam li jasna?
A što ćemo sa Sharon?
Odvest će je u ćeliju i tu
će ostati, nepovrijeđena.
OK. Što ti misliš o tome, Apollo?
Da napravimo kao što
ova draga žena kaže?
Ona je predsjednica Kolonija, idiote.
I da, napravit ćemo upravo to što kaže.
Spusti oružje. Sada.
Hvala.
A sad gurni tu stvar u svemir.
Što?
Mi ne držimo cylonce ovdje, poručniče.
Koji kauc? Rekli ste da
je nećete povrijediti!
Hej, Helo! Slušaj me!
Jedna od tih stvari je smjestila
2 metka u prsa moga oca.
To nisam bila ja!
- Adama je upucan?
-Da.
Propustili ste par
katastrofa, dok vas nije bilo.
- Reci mi da je živ.
- Je.
Nakon dvije operacije,
Cottle ga je uspio spasiti.
To nisam bila ja!
Kara!
Za ljubav bogova! Sharon? Ova
Sharon nas je spasila sa Caprice.
Reci im!
Reci im!
Ja znam kako naći
Ateninu grobnicu! A vi?
Kobol je velik planet!
Ne nađete li grobnicu,
nećete naći ni Zemlju!
Bogovi, poslušajte je!
Poslušaj me!
Gdjo predsjednice.
- Recite im da pričekaju.
- Da gdine.
Hvala.
Gdine Zarek, imate li
neko mjesto na kojemu...
- ova mlada žena i ja možemo porazgovarati?
- Da se srediti.
Lijepo te je opet vidjeti, Kara.
Hvala što si nam unijela smeće.
Izgleda da smo propustili svu zabavu.
Perry?
nE.
Mueller. Mueller nije loš izbor.
Jedan rok je služio kao xo odreda...
Mueller je nezadovoljnik.
Znam da to ne želiš čuti, no
nema drugog Apolla u floti.
A mi moramo izabrati novog CAGa.
Zapovjedniče Adama.
Poručniče Birch, uđite.
Hvala što ste došli tako brzo.
Naravno, gdine.
Siguran sam da ste
svjesni promjena u floti.
Nekoliko naših pilota je otišlo.
Mislio sam da nam treba novi CAG.
Slažem se, gdine.
Tko bi to mogao biti?
Čestitam vam, kapetane.
To ste vi.
Hvala, gdine.
Želim da znate da imate potpunu
podršku, kako mene tako i cijele posade.
Zar ne, pukovniče)
- Naravno.
- Uzmite svoj dnevnik.
Čestitam.
Počaščen sam, zapovjednče.
Neću vas iznevjeriti.
I, gdine, želio bih reći da sam
bio veliki pobornik vašeg sina,
kapetana Adame.
On je bio... je bio veliki vođa, gdine.
Brod je obitelj. Radi na povjerenju,
razumijevanju i ljubavi.
Volim svakoga na ovom brodu
isto koliko volim i mog si..
i svoje sinove.
Galactica je još uvijek obitelj.
Vi ste važan dio obitelji.
- Razumijete?
-Da, gdine.
Hvala, Geotge. Uvjeren sam da
ćete dobro odraditi posao...
Što koji kuac?
Doveo si me ovdje gnjaveći
me da odaberem novog CAGa,
a ti si već imao spremnog čovjeka.
Samo me zanimalo hoćemo
li odabrati istog.
- Molim?
- Izgleda da nismo.
Tako izgleda.
Ti mi kažeš da je taj
klinac materijal za vođu?
Imamo slab izbor. On je najbolji.
On je dobar čovjek, Saule.
Pošten je i lojalan.
Treba nam toga malo više ovuda.
Pa, izbor je tvoj. Ja ga podržavam.
Zapovjedniče,
Zapovjedniče Adama!
Imate li komentara glede Laure Roslin
i kako se osjećate zbog raskola?
Radi li ovo?
Molim vas sjednite.
Zapovjedniče, hoćete li odgovoriti....
Dozvolite mi da iznesem
izjavu, molim vas.
Dozvolite mi da izjavim ovo.
Molim vas sjednite.
Hvala vam.
Ako još ne znate, flota je podijeljena.
Molim vas! Svi dijelimo
bol zbog gubitka prijatelja.
I nedostatak zaliha koje smo žrtvovali
će predstavljati novi izazov za sve nas.
Ali ako ostanemo zajedno,
preživjet ćemo i to...
baš kao što smo i prije.
I? Pitanja.
Znate li koordinate, znate li
gdje su pobunjenici Laure Roslin?
Namjeravate li ponovo okupiti flotu?
Kao prvo, Laura Roslin
više nije predsjednica.
Odrekla se te funkcije kad je
potaknula pobunu na ovom brodu.
Sljedeće.
Ali--ali,
zapovjedniče!
Da, recite.
Otkad je flota podijeljena?
Zapovjedniče, niste
odgovorili na moje pitanje.
Nismo izgubili nikoga tko ne može
biti zamijenjen nekim lojalnim...
nekim tko je ostao uz nas.
Ovo je Flota.
Hvala vam.
Ima li istine u glasinama
da Zemlja ne postoji,
i da ste je vi izmislili?
Kakvo je to hebeno pitanje?
O tome se priča, ta priča kruži okolo.
Sloboda tiska nije
garancija za nedodirljivost.
Objavljivanje takvog smeća
je prečica do zatvora.
- To vrijedi za sve ovdje.
- Gotovi smo.
Maknite ruke sa mene.
Zašto se ne smiriš?
Podsjeti me da to ne ponovim.
Uvijek je izgledalo jednostavno
kad je Roslinka to radila.
Bio je stari uski most
ponad rijeke Euklid.
Prolazih njime kad sam bio dječak.
Gledah ribu kako pliva protiv struje.
Bile su hipnotizirajuće.
Zavidio sam im.
Totalno su bile nesvjesne...
većih komplikacija i životnih izazova.
Počinješ na ljude gledati
kao što mi gledamo njih.
Ono što počinjem
gledati su cylonska lica.
Gdje god pogledam.
Sharon je rekla da ih ima 8.
Zašto je nisi pitao tko su?
Da je ona glupača nije upucala...
i zašto kad stvari krenu
loše, krenu loše tako dobro?
Gaiuse, previše radiš na tome.
ššš. Stvarno izgledaju kao ribe, ne?
Oni?
Zašto mi govoriš kao
da nisam jedan od njih?
Na neki način nikad nisi ni bio.
Ti imaš svoj put, i bit ćeš
pošteđen njihove sudbine.
Napokon, možeš prestati manipulirati i
pustiti svijet da ide svojom sudbinom.
Ako nešto o ljudima
znamo sa sigurnošću...
to je da su umjetnici samouništenja.
Zato jer ga volim. I
jer nosim njegovo dijete.
O, razumijem. To sve
objašnjava. Nisi ovdje jer
nas namjeravaš uništiti ili
jer si programirani
neprijatelj čovječantva.
Ovdje si jer imaš vezu sa
jednim našim pilotom raptora.
- Slušajte me.
- Slušam te.
To je moja greška.
Slušam cylonca.
Ovdje sam jer sam
odabrala da budem ovdje.
I znam da mi ne vjerujuete.
No saslušajte ovo...
Ako i nađete grobnicu,
ako i nađete kartu,
čak ako i nađete Zemlju, cijena
koju ćete platiti će biti prevelika.
Ne zanimaju me tvoja proročanstva.
Znam da su cylonci na
Kobolu. Znam da je opasno.
I ne sumnjam da im prenosiš sve
što govorim, dok govorim.
To ne radi tako! Nisam
povezana sa njima!
Sharon, jednostavno je.
Ono što moram znati, i
ono što te drži na životu
je put do Atenine grobnice.
Nabavi mi kartu i napravit ću što mogu
bolje da vam pokažem gdje je grobnica.
Ne,nećeš napraviti što možeš
bolje. Želim znati gdje je grobnica.
I ti to znaš, ili ne znaš.
Svi mi znamo o grobici.
Mogu vam pokazati put.
Ne znam koliko je put
dug i gdje točno vodi,
ali vam mogu reći da ćete ga
morati prijeći vrlo, vrlo bzo.
Tvrdi da voli poručnika Agathona.
Tvrdi da voli bebu koju nosi.
Koga briga što ona tvrdi?
Ne možete vjerovati ni
riječ ni jednome od njih....
Pitijin pergamnet govori o nižem demonu
koji pomaže ljudima u vremenima krize.
Još praznovjerja.
Rekla sam joj da, ukoliko se ne
vratimo sa Kobola sa kartom do Zemlje,
da će poručnik Agathon biti izbačen
u svemir, kao cylonski špijun.
Je li to istina?
Nije bitno je li istina, bitno
je da je ona u to povjerovala.
Spasila ih je, oboje. Nije trebala.
Mogla je spasiti svoje
dijete i ostaviti ih da umru.
Zašto nije?
Jer vjerujem da govori istinu o jednome.
Ona misli da je zaljubljena.
Čak i ako je to samo
softverski, za nju je stvarno.
Želi da joj dijete živi.
Želi da Agathon živi.
Upotrijebili smo to.
Nisam mislio da će stveri tako ići.
Znao sam da će biti sumnjičavi, ali...
Oni su ljudi.
Takvi ste.
Je li kome palo na pamet da
Sharon zna toliko o Kobolu
jer se radi o cylonskoj zamci?
Ne samo da je palo. Vrlo je vjerojatno
da ulazimo u zamku.
Kapetan Apollo nas je već upozorio da
postoji mogućnost da naletimo na cylonce.
Je li nam kapetan Apollo
rekao išta što već ne znamo?
On zapovijeda misijom.
On je moj pobočnik.
Preporučam vam da to
zapamtite, gdine Meier.
Koliki god bio rizik i kakve
god bile posljedice, ja ću ići.
To mi je sudbina.
Kapetan Birch, Galactica. Možete
početi sa vježbama gađanja, potvrdite.
Galactica, ovdje vođa. Potvrđujem.
CAG svim viperima. Počinjemo
sa vježbom preciznog gađanja.
Hotdog, ti si prvi. Kat te slijedi.
Vježba pilota vipera Mete asteroidi
Vođo, Hotdog. Na meti sam.
Počinjem sa gađanjem na 3,
2,1.
Miči se!
Hebi ga! Izbjegni ga!
Ajmo ljudi, znam da je samo
vježba, ali ajmo malo ozbiljnosti.
Hotdog, možeš ti to bolje.
Pokušajmo opet. Vidi možemo li
poslati slijedećeg ravno u metu.
Pucam!
Spreman za slijedeći prolazak.
Vođo, Kat. Potvrđujem
da sam spremna za napad.
Jesam li spreman?
Vođo, Hotdog. Počinjem sa anpadom.
Potvrđujem, spreman si.
Ulazim! Počinjem pucati.
Vođo, Kat. Jesi li rekao da sam spremna?
Jesam.
OK; razumila.
Hajmo,dušo.
Počinjem na 3,
2,1! Pucam!
Vođo, počinjem sa uletom.
Kat što to radiš?
Rekao si da sam spremna za napad!
Hotdog je spreman!
Što? Hotdog?
Bježi, Kat! Odmah!
O
O Bogovi!
Kako sam ga razhebo, jeste vidjeli?
Razhebo? Hotdože, hebeni
idiote! Umalo me nisi ubio!
O čemu ti to?
Birch, rekao si da sam spremna.
Svi viperi, ovdje vođa.
Javite se nazad na Galacticu.
Hebote!
Znam kako se osjećaš.
Razumijem.
Ali ga nisam ja upucala.
To nisam bila ja.
Svi ste vi isti.
Ne znaš o čemu pričaš.
Onda sam možda gotov sa razgovorom.
Misli da se danas
ionako previše pričalo.
Ti si zadnji koji bi mi
trebao govoriti što da radim.
Nakon gluposti koju si izvela?
Krađe cylonskog lovca
i bijega na Capricu?
Aha, a ti si primjerak za poster sa natpisom "
Pridruži se vojsci! Mi znamom što je disciplina!"
Znaš što? Nemaš pojma što
mi se dogodilo na Caprici.
Pa dok stojiš tamo i glancaš
svoj odraz, na sekundu razmisli o
tome da nemaš nikakvu vražju
predodžbu o čemu pričaš
kapetane.
To što Roslinka želi je nesmotreno.
Mi sada imamo našu flotu.
Koliko dugo se moramo
pretvarati da je ona šefica?
Imamo flotu jer ljudi vjeruju da
će ih Roslinka odvesti na Zemlju.
Ona je varalica.
Ne vjeruješ joj, zar ne?
Ne,
ali vjerujem u moć mitova.
Ne zanima me riskiranje naših
života ništa više od tebe,
no mislim da je nećemo
uspjeti odgovoriti.
I na kraju, predsjednica
ili proročica, nema veze,
još uvijek joj treba zapovjednik.
Čovjek zadužen za flotu.
Čovjek sa oružjem koji stvara pravila.
Što ako zaključi da ti nisi
pravi čovjek za taj posao?
Što ako ima nekog drugog u vidu?
Nekoga bližeg njoj.
Poput određenog kapetana.
Pretpostavimo da si u pravu.
Na određenoj razini...zasnovanoj na
njihovom vjerovanju u svete spise,
floti treba Laura Roslin da se održi.
Znači, moramo učiniti sve
da Laura Roslin bude sigurna
na Kobolovoj površini.
No...
No?
U pravu si.
Potpuno si u pravu.
Kako nisam to vidio?
Želim ovu flotu povesti
na put u slobodu.
Naravno.
Želim im dati obećanu slobodu.
Daleko smo od dnevnog
svjetla, prijatelju.
Sveti tekstovi kažu da će
netko od nas umrijeti na Kobolu.
Jedan oderđeni čovjek.
Misija tankanja
- Malo si lijevo od središta.
- Striker, smanji potisak na .35, potvrdi.
Kakva mi je prilazna brzina?
Kutni vektori su ti
previše nagnuti. Prilagodi.
Ponavljam, kutni vektori su
ti previše nagnuti. Prilagodi.
Što to radi?
Reci mu da smanji brzinu.
- Što je sada?
- Drago mi je da si tu.
Birch koordinira brod sa
tankerom. Ali pravi nered od
najjednostavnijeg školskog zadatka!
Koliko dugo radi to?
Četiri sata.
Gdine, on je previše zelen.
Griješi kod prilazne i sletne brzine.
Promašiva kočenja. Miješa linije.
Vani je nered.
Kao što znaš, ovo m nije prva greška.
Da, znam.
Shvaćam da je on tvoj čovjek, no...
No on nije Apollo.
Pitao sam se kad ćemo imati
malo odmora i zabave ovdje.
O, bože.
Mogu li dobiti svoju loptu nazad?
Što, ja se ne smijem igrati?
Mogu li dobiti svoju
loptu nazad, molim te?
Gdje si uopće došla do piramidne lopte?
Caprica.
Možeš li mi vratiti loptu, Lee?
Da, evo.
Zadrži je.
Hej, hajde, Kara. Samo se zahebavam.
U redu, evo,
samo je tvoja.
Možeš uzeti svoju loptu i otići kući.
Ionako više nije zabavno.
Što je sa tobom, Kara?
Želiš li razgovarati?
Ne.
Hmm. Mora da ti je bilo
teško, tamo na Caprici.
Biti doma.
Valjda si vidjela teške stvari.
Kako bilo, sutra ovo sve
završava, na ovaj ili onaj način.
Ili ćemo naći grobnicu, ili nećemo.
Ili ćemo naći Zemlju, ili nećemo.
Želim da znaš, Kara,
da sam ti ja prijatelj.
Volim te.
Ako o bilo čemu želiš razgovarati,
skinuti teret sa pleća,
ovdje sam za tebe.
U svakom slučaju... kad
poželiš razgovarati, tu sam.
Što si ono rekao?
Hmm? Na što misliš?
Jesi li rekao da me voliš?
Pa, hmm
Lee Adama me voli.
Ne, ono što
sam mislio---
ne, ozbiljno, to je slatko. Ti ne voliš.
Ne, ti me voliš. Nema povratka.
Sanjaj, Kara.
- Ti me voliš.
- Sanjaš.
- Voliš me.
- Sanjarko.
mmhmm. ok.
Ovdje Striker, Imam problema,
ne vidim mjesto za gorivo.
Možeš li preusmjeriti?
Pumpa, Striker dolazi prebrzo.
Moraš smanjiti brzinu, odmah.
Razumio, nastavljam pod ovim kutem.
Zar nas na čuješ? Smanji brzinu!
Preblizu si! Slušaš li?
Nismo preblizu.
OK. Stani! Prekini
operaciju. Opozovi brodove.
Galactica svim brodovima
u operaciji punjenja.
Prekini misiju. Ponavljam, prekini.
Raptori, vratite se u bazu. Potvrdite.
Potvrđujemo, Galactica.
Vraćamo se u bazu.
Prokletstvo!
Razumio. Galactica traži prekid prilaza.
Kutni vektori u puni potisak.
Striker, još si na sudarnom kursu.
Okreni kormilo lijevo, puni rikverc.
Makni se! Pazi!
Galactica, Emmit. Takner nije oštećen.
Nema bežičnog kontakta,
no vrti se duž osi.
Izgleda da ima nekih oštećenja.
Šalji spasilački tim. Neka se ukrcaju
na tanker i povrate navigaciju.
Spasilački timovi u sektor 046.
Galijunska livada Kobol
Ovdje.
Nikad ne znaš kad ćeš
se trebati braniti.
Idemo. I bljesak ih je pratio.
I ljudi Kobola imadoše izbor,
ukrcati se na veliki brod ili
krenuti planinskim putem
preko kamenite gore..?
I tijelo vođe svakog plemena je
ponuđeno bogovima u Ateninoj grobnici.
Da, baš tako.
I veliki brod bijaše Galijun, i poletio
je odavde, baš gdje mi sada stojimo.
I poveo je sa sobom osnivače 13
kolonija na put prema njihovoj sudbini.
I svi koji se nisu ukrcali na
Galijun kernuše planinskim putem...
koji je vodio do grobnice?
Krenimo.
Put bi trebao biti označen
nadgrobnim spomenicima.
Ovdje je nešto.
Čekaj!
Nazad!
Sharon, Sharon, u zaklon.
Promijeni.
- Lijep pogodak.
- Municija!
Evo.
Lee, ne!
Prokletstvo!
Mora da me hebeš u zdrav mozak.
Nije loše. Prokletstvo.
Interesantno.
Izdaja ima tako snažan
stisak na svijest.
Gotovo poput pitona.
Može istisnuti sve ostale misli van.
Ugušiti sve druge emocije dok
sve osim bijesa ne bude mrtvo.
Ne pričam o ljutnji.
Pričam o bijesu.
Mogu ga osjetiti.
Baš ovdje.
Kao da će eksplodirati.
Kao da želim vrištati.
Upravo sada.
Mogu li nešto reći?
Slobodno reci.
Ne misli da je problem
što su vas izdali.
Mislim da je problem što
se osjećate bespomoćno.
Upucani ste, ozlijeđeni.
Niste mogli ništa učiniti.
Ne traži mi izlike.
A kad ste napokon nešto mogli učiniti...
Oprosti zbog ovoga.
Iznevjerili ste nas.
Iznevjerili ste nas.
Obećali ste nam...
da ćemo naći Zemlju,
da ćemo naći dom.
Zajedno.
Nema veze što je predsjednica
napravila, što je Lee napravio,
jer svaki dan razdvojenosti,
je dan pogaženog obećanja.
Ljudi na tim brodovima su
sami donijeli svoje odluke.
To je bio njihov izbor, ne moj.
Hvala ti. Možeš ići.
Htjeli ste razgovarati
sam mnom, gdine,...
možda jer ste mislili
da nemam što reći.
Ali imam.
Vrijeme ja da izliječite
rane, zapovjedniče.
Ljudi su podijeljeni.
Rekoh, dosta.
Djeca razdvojena od roditelja.
Cijena u krvi.
Hajdemo, gdjo predsjednice.
Gdine Gaeta.
Želim vidjeti sav materijal
prikupljen tijekom izviđanja
Kobola. Donesite ga u moje prostorije.
da, gdine.
Kobol?
Da.
Ponovo okupljam flotu.
Ponovo okupljam obitelj.
Ovo sada završava.
nastavlja se
Prijevod : innuit
Prema transkriptu sa bsg-cz.net

Ljudi, maknite se!
Ostanite dalje, u redu?
Trebaju nam samo ove zalihe!
Maknite ih dalje, držite ih dalje!
Prestani pucati! Prestani pucati!
Doktor! Treba nam doktor ovamo!
Tata! Tata?
O, Bogovi! O, Bogovi!
Ovo je nedavno otkrivena
snimka događaja poznatog kao
"Gideonski masakr", i pokaziva da su
marinci sa Galactice pucali ne birajući mete
po gomili nenaoružanih civila.
4 mrtva, 12 ranjenih.
No ipak, do danas nije podnijeta
ni jedna prijava protiv...
ijednog marinca uključenog u događaj,
ni protiv njihovog zapovjednika.
Izvještavala vas je D'Anna Biers.
Ovo će razotkriti cijelu stvar.
Trebat će nam neka
stara snimka marinaca.
Montirat ćemo je sa izjavama očevidaca.
Nemate prava upadati ovdje tako.
Gdjo, morate poći sa nama.
Jesam li uhapšena?
Ne, gdjo.
A ako odbijem poći?
Predsjednički brod "Kolonijalni 1"
Dobar dan, gdjice Biers.
Lijepo vas je vidjeti.
Dobrodošli na Kolonijalni 1.
Gdjo predsjednice, čast mi je.
Zapovjedniče Adama.
Kako ste došli do trake?
Dobila od anonimnog domoljuba.
I, je li ovo obično druženje, ili
smo na pomolu novog državnog udara?
Smiješno.
Samo da probijem led.
Vjerjuem da sam ovdje
jer niste presretni..
mojom pričom o Gideonskom amsakru?
To što se dogodilo na
Gideonu je tragedija.
A ne masakr.
Ali traka pokazuje vaše ljude koji
pucaju po nenaoružanim civilima.
Moji marinci imaju drugačiju priču.
Meni je nisu rekli.
Podnijela sam 12ak zahtjeva za
intervjue, i svi su odbijeni.
To će se promijeniti.
Već mjesecima pokušavate
napraviti priču o Galacitici.
Zapovjednik Adama je pristao da
vam da neograničeni pristup...
svojoj posadi i brodu.
Tako je.Neograničeni pristup.
Pristup vam neće kupiti reklamu.
Ne tražimo je.
Gdjice Biers, ova vaša traka...
je dodala iskru već umirućoj vatri.
Ljudi su ljuti i ne vjeruju vojsci.
Pa, imaju dobar razlog.
Ponekad imaju dobar razlog.
No ja želim pokazati ljudima kakav
je stvarni život na Galactici.
Želim da dobiju sliku pravih
ljudi, posade i časnika
koji nas štite od cylonaca,
i čuvaju našu slobodu, svakodnevno.
Možda vam se ne svidi ono što snimimo.
A zašto nam se ne bi svidjelo?
Sve što želimo je balansirana
priča, bez predrasuda.
Pokažite im kakvi su ljudi sa Galactice.
To je to?
To je to.
I morate to napraviti odmah,
dok ne nastane veća šteta.
CAG bi trebao uvesti reda.
Pola naših opskrbnih letova kasni.
Borba, Dualla.
Pukovniče, vaša žena. Nešto nije u redu.
Pukovniče.
Ellen, jesi dobro?
Saul. Bogovi!
Prestravljena sam.
"Iz mraka, moraš pasti"
Što to znači?
Racetrack.
Gdje si našao ovo?
Oprostite, gdine, ostali
su nakon prijevoza civila.
Htio sam ih baciti.
Ne.
Stavi ih na sigurno. Sačuvaj ih.
Da, gdine.
Snimate ovo?
Snimamo još od Kolonijalnog 1.
Predsjednica je rekla
neograničeni pristup.
Imat ćete ga.
No budete li snimali išta
što ugrožava sigurnost broda
bit će izrezano.
Taj šum što čujete je zvuk
jedinice za cirkulaciju zraka.
Imamo oko 12 skupljača CO2 na Galactici.
Svi rade 24 sata dnevno.
Bell, snimi to izbliza.
Evo idem.
Upravo završavamo 15 satnu smjenu.
Pa, bolje se priviknite na to.
Nedostajat će nam pilota
sve dok ostatak flote...
ne izvuče štap iz svoje debele guzice.
Još otpada iz doba
Tighova trenutka slave?
Čuo si o prijetnjama smrću?
Nije se moglo dogoditi boljem čovjeku.
Ne mogu vjerovati da
nas još nisu ispitali.
O, ti si na vrhu liste.
Ali nemaj brige, rekao sam Tighu da
ne bi prepoznala Capriciansku poeziju..
ni da ti je ugravirana na šljemu.
"Iz mraka, moraš pasti...
promašen i slab, natrag u mrak"
Kataris.
I ne jedna od boljih.
Mogu li ponovo biti
osumnjičena? Molim te?
Brodska kuhinja je slijedeća na redu.
Naša skladišta povrća i
konzervirane hrane su od titanija..
da bi osigurali maksimalnu svježinu.
Nismo došli ovdje raditi
intervju sa današnjom juhom.
O, ne!
Gdjo?
Stižu Mujo i Haso.
Čujte, ljudi spavaju.
U redu, bit ćemo tihi.
- Oprosti.
- Ne ljuti se, Palladino.
Hej, je li to radi? Snimate
li? Alo mama! Nedostaješ mi!
Ovo je za moje frendove
na teretnjaku 212.
Da! ovo je za vas.
Kat!
Kat,želiš li mi reći koji kuac radiš?
Samo pozdravljam neke
prijatelje u floti, gdine.
U redu.
Znači doslovno govoriš iz guzice.
Otprilike.
Hajde, obucite se.
-Da, gdine.
-Costanza, gubi se odavde.
Ovo je zadnji put da ste ušli u
prostorije starijih časnika. Nestanite.
Znači, vi ste novinarka
koju smo očekivali.
Niste se trebali dotjerati za mene.
D'anna Biers, Flotina
izvještajna agencija.
Kapetan Lee Adama,CAG, zapovjednik
letača. To se izgovara CAG.
I predlažem vam da
što prije nađete izlaz.
A to se izgovara ASAP.
Mislim da smo vidjeli
sve što smo trebali.
Čija je to briljantna ideja bila?
Kako je vaša obitelj reagirala?
Otac je poludio kad sam se prijavila.
Smatrao je vojsku mjestom
za bezveznjakoviće.
Skladištem emocionalnih
invalida i domoljubnih budala.
Ali ste se svejedno prijavili.
Pretpostavljam da sam
htjela vjerovati u nešto.
Mislišm da će time dobiti više memorije?
Da, izgleda prilično jednostavno.
Možda samo osnovno podešavanje.
To je prilično dobar komad.
Da, pomalo star...
Što se koji kuac događa?
Ne znam,
Ne znam. Ja sam potpredsjednik.
Mene bi trebala intervjuirati, zar ne?
Naravno da bi trebala. Sama
tvoja titula zahtjeva poštovanje.
Naravno da zahtjeva. To
je rijetka prednost ovdje.
Htjedoh reći, ja sam Potpredsjednik.
Neću moliti, da znaš.
Gle, Gaiuse, možda bi trebao moliti.
Moraš napraviti sve da
zaštitiš naše dijete.
Politika ti nije jača strana.
Ali služi svrsi, u ovom trenu.
Vjeruj mi.
Ova nam može pomoći.
Gdine potpredsjedniče?
'Dan.
Bok, ja sam D'Anna Biers,
Flotina izvještajna agencija.
O, vi ste novinarka.
U pravu ste. Zapovjednik Adama
je rekao da bi nam se mogil
pridružiti neki novinari.
Pretpostavljam da ste...
zauzeti i da radite mnoge intervjue.
Pa, voljela bih razgovarati sa vama.
Ako imate tren, možemo i sada.
Ne, ne. Bojim se da ne. Ja sam...
vrlo zauzet.
Vrlo, vrlo zauzet sada, zatrpan poslom.
Ali možete dogovoriti
sa mojim pomoćnikom...
možda neđem vremena za vas sutra.
Ništa ne obećajem.
Ali možda uspijem...
Sutra vam dati intervju...ako to želite.
- Dobro.
- Da, dobro. Pa, vi samo...
nastavite dalje.
Čudnog li čovječuljka.
Kapetane Adama, jedva
vas prepoznah obučenog.
Gle, siguran sam da vam
se činila dobra ideja...
upasti u pilotske prostrije. No....
to područje je zatvoreno zbog dobrog
razloga. To je jedino mjesto gdje moji ljudi
se mogu odmoriti i biti svoji.
Zvučite kao da mislite da pilotima
trebaju dodatne povlastice.
Ustvari, i mislim tako.
Poput svih,
i moji piloti su izgubili obitelji....
prijatelje...
svakoga za koga im je bilo stalo.
I povrh toga, od nijh se
očekuje da riskiraju život
svaki dan
za flotu koja iz radije optužuje
nego hvali.
Ne traže samilost, ali
zaslužuju poštovanje.
Bogovi, šefe, već smo
ga dvaput pregledali.
Jesmo, i nešto i dalje ne zvuči dobro.
Što?
Nešto ne zvuči dobro.
Požurite.
O, bogovi!
To je sjajno. To je fantastično.
Znao sam.
Kako sam to propustio?
Ne bi propustili da
tvoji mehaničari više radie
a manje se zahebavaju okolo.
Ovaj mehaničar ti je spasio guzicu.
Možeš li malo glasnije, šefe?
Nisu te snimili.
Znaš što? Hebi kameru.
Prekini! Prekini!
Šefe, popravi brod.
- Aha, popravi brod.
-Hej!
Što? Što?
Hej. Dosta je bilo!
Šefe, popravi joj brod.
Ti, nestani odavde.
Miči tu kameru od mene.
Piša po meni cijeli tjedan.
Što se koji kuac događa?
Mičem je iz smjene dok se
ne oporavi. Hoću reći...
Ne možeš. Trebaju mi piloti.
A uz to, da maknem svakoga
tko je popizdio na šefa...
na kraju bi kuhari letjeli.
Kurvin sin.
Jesi li sve snimio?
- Sretan?
- Hajde.
Hajde, kreni dalje.
Nikad nismo bili
trenirani za nadzor gomile.
Prva zapovijed, kad si pod napadom, je
brani sebe i svoj odred.
Ali ovo su bili civili.
Imam 10 ponata koji
kažu da su nas napali.
Istina je, to je bila
zapovjedna graška...
od trena kad nas je
Tigh poslao na taj b rod.
Ni ne čudi me što netko pokušava
ubiti tog pijanog kučkinog sina.
Stani vojniče. Briši to.
Pukovniku Tighu se prijeti?
Ne, ovaj intervju je gotov. Gasi kameru.
- Zapovjedniče...
- Pazite se.
OK. Dođi.
Situacija?
Flota je mirna,
neprijatelja nema već danima.
Nikakvih cylonaca na obzoru.
Imaju ljudi svoj
posao, baš kao i mi naš.
Jesi li čuo o sastanku na Oblaku 9?
Predstavnici svih brodova dolaze na
veliko zasjedanje. Da, čuo sam.
Pozvali su i nas.
Ti ćeš nas predstavljati.
To ti smeta?
Ne, Ne, samo reci.
Trenutno nisam
najpopularniji lik u floti.
Onda će biti dobro da
tovji kritičari vide da ih se ne bojiš.
To misliš?
Da se sakrivam?
Bille, što se događa?
Predugo si u ovome da se
brineš o skrivenim motivima.
Ideš jer se ne bojiš,
i ljudi to trebaju vidjeti.
Plus, dat ćeš ljudima šansu
da izvjetre svoje osjećaje
umjesto da ih potiskivaju.
I na kraju..
mislim da ti treba malo odmora.
Stoga ovo smatraj obveznim odmorom.
Otplivaj malo. Naspavaj se.
Gdine.
I...
kloni se pića.
3.
To je 3. Zaključana je.
Sretno, pukovniče.
Zabavite se na Oblaku 9.
Mo'š se kladit'.
Počinjem sa pripremom za uzlet.
Što se događa?
Prekini polijetanje! Svi vani, odmah!
Nazad! Svi nazad!
Vatrogasce! Dovedite vatrogasce!
Što se događa?
Glavni dovod je uništen.
Izgleda kao da ga je
netko razbio čekičem.
Da je pukao u letu, sav
zrak bi izašao u svemir.
Netko te htio ubiti, Saule.
To dolazi sa činom.
Zbog hebenog Gideonskog incidenta.
Ellen, ne znamo to.
Naravno da znamo.
D'Anna Biers je ostavila 2 poruke.
Daje ti šansu da ispričaš
svoju verziju priče.
Ne moram se opravdavati...
pogotovo ne njoj.
Roslinka želi zadovoljiti flotu
i vratiti velikog Billa
Adamu nazad na pijedestal.
Najbrži način za to je da tebe objesi.
Što misliš zašto te
Adama poslao na Oblak 9?
Gideon se dogodio dok
sam ja zapovijedao.
Je.
Ali nisi ti naredio kretenima da pucaju.
To je baš slično tebi, Saule.
Uvijek ponosni vojak.
Preuzimaš krivnju jer je to časno.
Kad ćeš shvatiti...
da smo sami?
Je li vas strah kada krećete u borbu?
Prva stvar koju vam kažu
je da se smatrate mrtvim.
To zvuči zastrašujuće.
Pa, možda.
Ali mrtvaci se ne boje
ili slede pod vatrom.
Ja, ja se samo bajim da
je pakao usamljeno mjesto.
I namjeravam ga napuniti
svakim tosterom na kojeg naiđem.
Što vam je bilo najteže?
Pokušavaju vam isključiti
ljudski dio jer...
je on taj koji te ubije. Ali...
kad si na bojištu, to nije tako lako.
Ništa nije lako.
Imate 5 minuta.
Sharon? Ja sam.
Sharon!
Daj mi svoju lampu.
O čemu pričaš?
Daj mi lampu! Nešto nije u redu!
O bogovi. Zovi dr Cottlea.
Odmah!
Pomaže li vam to u borbi sa stresom?
Baš i ne.
Gledajte...
sve što sam ikada želio je
biti časnik na bojnoj zvijezdi.
Vježbao sam cijeli život..
trenirao jače od ikoga u
mojoj jedinici. U stvari...
cijeli život mi je stao dok
niasm dobio mjesto na Galactici.
A onda su cylonci udarili. I...
sad shvaćam da samo ovo poznam.
Tehnički priručnici,
zapovijedi, taktika.
Ne kažem da sam nesretan.
Samo se pitam postoji li što više.
I što ste otkrili?
Mrzim cigarete.
Ambrozija je dobra sa sirom.
I...
ako popiješ dovoljno ambrozije...
bol ne boli više toliko.
Evo nas. Napravit ćemo
ovo što bezbolnije.
Piće?
Je li ovo intervju ili koktel parti?
Zezate? Ovako ćemo to učiniti bezbolnim.
Samo budite prirodni, i to je to.
Molim vas.
Nazdravlje, pukovniče.
Nazdravlje.
Prije nego što počnemo...
čula sam brojne glasine o..
prijetnjama smrću koje
primate. Je li to istina?
Ovo je vojni brod. Mi imamo
glasine za svaku priliku.
Je li vam bilo teško preuzeti
prijateljevo zapovjedništvo...
nakon što je bio upucan?
Nisam preuzeo ništa.
Zapovjedništvo je palo na mene,
i ja sam obavio svoju dužnost.
Ali vi ste bili zapovjednik
Galactice više od tjedna.
I za to vrijeme poduzeli ste
više kontroverznih akcija.
Govorite o Gideonu.
Donio sam vojnu odluku.
U istim uvjetima, donio bih je opet.
Znači, ne žalite za ničim?
Pokušavate mi smjestiti.
Pukovniče, zašto nije
bilo službene istrage...
o Gideonskom masakru?
- Molim vas , pukovniče..
- Bježi od mene!
Jesi li snimio sve?
Jesam.
Netko je gadan kad popije.
Divno.
Trebala bih sparing partnera.
Žao mi je..
Nisam ponijela rukavice.
Šteta.
Kapetan Adama je rekao da
vas pitam o novim pilotima.
Kapetan Adama me voli izluđivati.
Što tražite kod regruta?
Koordinaciju.
Dobre reflekse.
Potpunu posvećenost.
I najviše od svega...
ludost da me prati u borbu.
Pukovniče, što mislite zašto
nije bilo službene istrage o...
Gideonskom masakru?
- Molim vas, pukovniče...
- Bježite od mene!
Htio bih se ispričati zbog
ponašanja pukovnika Tigha.
Izgleda sa su se mnogi
ispričavali zbog njega...
tijekom godina, zapovjedniče.
Budite iskreni sa mnom.
Zašto pukovnik Tigh nije bio
optužen za Gideonski incident?
Mi smo u ratu...
protiv neprijatelja...
koji je nadmoćan.
Neću žrtvovati ljude
na oltar javanog bijesa.
4 civila su mrtva...
a Tigh i oni koji su
pucali slobodno šeću.
Nitko nije odšetao.
Svi oni moraju živjeti s tim.
Viper 591, Galactica...
počni kočiti.
Lijevi sletni hangar, ručni prilaz...
sve zeleno. Hajde.
Razumio.
Samo sekundu. Bogovi..
prokletstvo.
Brzina 205. Ne gasi motore, Kat.
Propadaš ispod klizne staze.
Kontrole su se poremetile.
Hajde.
Prenisko si. Preleti, Kat. Preleti!
O, hebi ga!
Što se koji kuac događa?
Ovo joj je treći prelet.
Kad uspostavimo kontakt...
odred ima sekunde da poleti.
Provjera prije polijetanja,
provjera oružja, veze.
Jedna greška, i postajemo
mrtvo meso u kokpitu.
Ne razumijem. Što pokušava...
Začepi hebenu gubicu.
Kat.
Možemo ovo napraviti,ok?
Pusti gas dole do sredine, i onda...
ga skini kad se približiš.
I padni na palubu.
Kontrole su zbrkane. Ne osjećam ih.
Ne osjećam ih.
Kat, ovo smo vježbali.
Možeš to izvesti, kao i prije.
Viper 591, Galactica...
možeš sletjeti.
Prenisko si, 591! Preleti!
Ne, slijeće! Kat, puni gas, sad!
Ne osjećam ih!
Kad se vraćaš sa uspješne misije...
to je bolje od dobrog obroka, znaš.
Bolje od..
dobijanja jackpota. Bolje od seksa.
Ne mogu!
Promašila je trap.
Tim za popravke, doktori, svi u hangar.
Što se dogodilo? Kat je
slijetala stotinu puta.
Pa, sto i prvi je bio onaj zahebani.
Ne! Pustite me!
Hej. Kat.
Dobro si. Doma si.
Doma? Dom je uništen!
Moramo pobjeći odavde!
Pobit će nas! Moramo pobjeći!
Što je ovo? Stimulanti?
Molim te, ne uzimaj
ih...Ne uzimaj ih, molim te!
Prestani.
Pusti me! Ne!
Pusti me! Svi ćemo pomrijeti!
Vodi je u bolnicu.
O,molim te, ne vodi me! Molim te...
Stimulanti.
I kako izgleda, žestoko ih je trošila.
Da se nisi usudio
dotaknut me! Što radiš?
Slušaj me! Pokušavam spasiti bebu!
Drži je.
Ovo je zabranjeno područje!
Zapovjedniče. Ovdje je.
Zapovjedniče Adama.
Ova žena izgleda kao
pokojna poručnica Valerii.
Traka, molim vas.
Zašto je cylonac na Galactici?
Traka.
Je li beba preživjela?
Shvaćate li da bi i
samo natruha ovoga....
bila pogubna za moral flote?
Vi ste umjetnik u potcjenjivanju.
Znate, nakon Gudeona, ovo bi moglo
okrenuti cijelu flotu protiv vas.
Onda je pravo pitanje...
koliko je vama stalo do toga.
Znate, pun mi je kuac ljudi poput vas
koji preispitivaju moje domoljublje.
Svi želimo da flota preživi.
Mislim da nam ide dobro.
Pod ovi uvjetima.
Shvaćam da je ovo bio
težak posao za vas.
Hoću reći, čujem da vaši
izvještaji nisu baš...
po zapovjednikovoj volji, zar ne?
Ili po volji ostatka posade.
No,kao član civilne vlasti,
ovdje sam da vas uvjerim
da ja nemam što skrivati.
Mislim da većina posade shaća
da samo radim svoj posao.
Kao i svi mi. Samo
radimo svoj posao, ne?
Ja radim svoj, vi vaš.
Ok,smanji sranje, Gaiuse.
Reci joj zašto ti
zaslužuješ da vodiš flotu.
Kao što sam sam otkrio...
kad sam bio
ostavljen...ostavljen na Kobolu...
Otkrio sam da je stres
preživljavanja u meni probudio
vještine vođe koje prethodno nisam...
nisam ni znao da imam, u stvari.
da?
Koliko znam, vaša grupa
je imala više žrtava.
Da, to je nažalost točno.
Bili su heroji, svi do jednoga.
Znate što? Spreman sam.
Hoćemo li snimiti i ovo?
Vjerojatno je lažna
uzbuna. Ignorirajte to.
OK. Bell, kreni do hangara.
- Ja idem na most. Kreni!
- Ovdje ste sigurniji.
Ovdje ste sigurni,  molim vas, ostanite.
Cylonski lovci nadolaze.
Ovo nije vježba.
- Ponavljam, bojni položaji...
- To je estrada :)
Stanje jedan na cijelom
brodu. Ovo nije vježba.
Što imamo?
2 lovca, brzo se približavaju.
Gdine..
cylonci su na CBDRu sa Galacticom.
Brzina 22,79.
Dualla, što je CBDR?
Sudarit će se sa nama.
Gdje je CAP?
Na drugoj strani flote.
Pozovi lovce.
Stanje jedan u cijeloj floti.
Neka zagriju FTL motore.
Kreni! Miči se!
Očisti palubu, miči ovo
odavde! Kakva je situacija?
2 neprijatelja, brzo prilaze.
Otvorite oči i slijedite nas.
Ajde, stavimo ove ptice u rupe!
Miči ovo, stavi ljestve tamo.
Hajde! Makni to crijevo odavde!
Prvi tim u cijevima.
- Dee.
- Pilote na zvučnik.
Jeste li našli zajednički jezik sa ocem?
Nisam mu dopustila.
Zadnji put kad smo pričali, ja sam se..
zagrijala.
Rekla sam mu da ga više
nikada ne želim vidjeti.
3 tjedna kasnije, cylonci su napali.
U redu, ovo je za mene novo.
Trebam li se bojati?
Ja se bojim.
Razumio.
U redu, to je to. I
zadnja ptica je poletjela.
Očistimo gnijezdo.
Pripremimo se za povratak.
Hajde!Kreni!Miči se!
Gdine, lovci su poletjeli.
Topovi su spremni.
Apolo, provjera.
Starbuck, čujem te.
Hotdog, 141, glasno i jasno.
Grayshirt, jasno i glasno.
Kingston, čujem te.
Počnite sa delta manevrima.
Apollo, prati 2 cylonca,
bliska formacija.
Starbuck ovdje, razumio.
Pazite na formaciju.
Pripremite se. Oružje spremno.
Meta u dosegu.
Smjer 6-1-2-1.
Oružje
na 2-4-1
Razumio.
Tango 1,
Oružje na 2-4-1
Prekidaju formaciju.
Hotdog, ostani uz mene.
Razumio.
Hajde, hebeni...
Nema sreće, ne vidim ih.
Na meni je, iza leđa.
- Hajde, Starbuck!
- Hajde!
Hotdog, dolaze ti straga lijevo.
Jedan manje.
Ciljam drugog.
Kingston, neprijatelj bježi.
Imam ga. Dođi tatici.
Prokletstvo, pucaj!
To je ubijeni cylonac.
Da!
Dradis je praza, zapovjedniče.
Ovdje Zapovjednik.
Cylonci su uništeni. Vrlo Dobro, ljudi.
Razumio, Galactica.
Vratimo se na farmu.
Osigurajte sve položaje.
Postavi stanje 3.
Gdine Gaeta..
Most je vaš.
Da, gdine.
Stanje 3 na cijelom brodu.
Ponavljam, stanje 3.
Postaje li s vremenom lakše?
Ne, gdjo.
Postaje sve teže.
Hvala vam.
Pa kako je bilo?
Nikoga nismo izgubili.
To je dobar dan.
Ellen?
Nisam sigurna imamo li priču.
Vrati malo.
Evo, tu.
Znam tu knjigu.
To je Kataris.
Što nije u redu,
pukovniče? Trebate li piće?
Možeš ići u pakao.
Bio sam tamo.
Zove se Gideon.
Ne mogu jesti, ne mogu spavati.
Vidio sam njihova lica.
To nisu bili cylonci, to su bili ljudi.
Koji izgledaju kao moj otac..
koji izgledaju kao moj mali brat.
Ovo neće ništa promijeniti.
Barem će ljudi sa Gideona
dobiti svoju pravdu.
Ako je to u pitanju, onda učini to.
Hoću, učinit ću to.
Netko treba platiti za ono
što se dogodilo na tom brodu.
Ja sam zapovijedao....
Ja sam te poslao tamo.
Greška je moja.
Hajde, sine.
Učini to.
Gideon je bio nesreća.
Ovo je izbor.
Pukovniče! Mi smo u redu.
Hajde, poručniče.
Makni mi se iz vidnog polja.
Što te natjeralo da to učiniš, Kat?
Bila sam umorna.
Nisam mogla spavati.
Osjećala sam se kao da gubim oštrinu.
Nisam znala što drugo da učinim.
Nisi mogla sa nekim razgovarati?
Sa kim? Svi smo u istom sranju.
Ne dolazi zamjena.
Nema odmora. To je to.
Pa sam počela uzimati stimulante.
Pogriješila si. Događa se.
Samo što je sad moj
odred kratak za pilota.
Ti momci, isto su umorni
i očajni poput mene.
Ali se još drže.
Ubijala sam se braneći ovaj brod.
Bila sam...bila sam
frustrirana. Bila sam ljuta.
Bila sam sve što možete zamisliti.
Ali ovo je prvi put da sam posramljena.
Vidjeli smo dovoljno.
Ugasi.
Gle...
Razumijem da je ovo moglo
biti teško gledati...
Ovo je poklopac lijesa.
Flota ionako već misli da smo
gomila ubojica lakih na obaraču.
Ovo samo potvrđuje to.
Uhvatili ste nas sa hlaćama
dole i guzicama u zraku.
Imate li vi što za dodati?
Mislim da je jako dobro.
Mislim da je napravila baš ono
što smo joj rekli da napravi.
Stavila je ljudsko lice na čuvare flote.
Greške i sve.
Ponosan sam na to.
Možemo to pokazati floti.
Neće biti bolje od ovoga.
Volio bih vidjeti kraj.
I ja.
Došla sam na Galacticu
da isptičam priču.
I da budem iskrena...
Mislila sam da unaprijed
znam kakva će biti.
Kako je arogantna vojska
dopustila svojem egu
da stane između dužnosti
i čuvanja života civila.
Ali sam otkrila da je
istina kompliciranija.
Ovi ljudi nisu cylonci.
Nisu roboti koji slijepo slijede
zapovjedi i glancaju čizme.
Oni su ljudi.
Sa greškama, ali ipak ljudi.
Kao i svi mi.
Ono što me najviše dirnulo
- težak život, stres,
stalno prisutna opasnost
- usprkos svemu tome...
oni ne odustaju.
Ne liježu na cestu i ne
puštaju kamionu da ih zgazi.
Bude se ujutro, oblače uniformu,
i rade svoj posao.
Svaki dan...
bez plaće. Bez odmora.
Bez nade da će im se taj teret skinuti
sa leđa, bez prepuštanja posla drugome.
Nikakva zamjena neće doći...
nema kolonijalne flote
koja trenira nove regrute.
Ljudi sa Galactice su sve.
Oni su tanka linija što
nas dijeli od cylonaca.
Poručnik Gaeta mi je rekao
zadivljujuću statistiku.
Ni jedan član Galacticine
posade nije tražio otpust.
Ni jedan.
Razmislite o tome.
Da ste vi u uniformi,
ne biste li htjeli otići?
Stati korak iza i reći...
"Dosta. Nek sad neko
drugi pazi na flotu."
Znam da ja bih.
No onda, ja ne nosim uniformu.
Većina nas ne nosi, i nikad neće.
Priča o Galctici nie o lošim
odlukama donijetim pod stresom.
Nego o greškama koje su iznimke.
Većinu vremena...
ljudi koji služe pod
zapovjednikom Adamom su u parvu.
Dokaz je preživljavanje naše flote.
I sa Galacticom na našoj strani,
preživljavat ćemo i dalje.
Ovo je bila D'Anna Biers,
Flotina izvještajna agencija.
Ovo se prikazivalo po cijeloj floti.
Njihova otpornost je zapanjujuća.
Pusti iskinuti dio snimke.
- Što radiš!
- Slušaj me!
Stani!
Pokušavam ti spasiti dijete.
- Drži je!
- Ovo je zabranjena zona!
Još sam živa.
Još je živa.
Rekao sam ti.
To je nevjerojatno.
A beba?
Spašena je.
Izgubili smo dva lovca koja su
prenosili ovo do flote, ali...
to je bila potrebna žrtva.
Moramo oprezno nastaviti.
Djetetov život se mora
sačuvati, po svaku cijenu.
Da.
Ovo je Božje čudo.
Umrežimo FTL računalo
sa navigacijom, dcom i kontrolom paljbe.
Jednom kad su povezani, trebat će
im samo 10 minuta da dovrše izračun.
Stvarno se nadaš da ćeš
nadmudriti cylonce u njihovoj igri?
Cylonci hakiraju našu mrežu.
Pokušavaju pristupiti
našem glavnom računalu.
Što je to koji kuac bilo?
To je virus, gdine.
Mislim da je..
ugnijezdio svoje kopije
u neki drugi sustav.
Izbacio je glavno napajanje
i pomoćne jedinice.
Volim te, šefe.
Što hoćeš od mene, Helo? Ona je cylonac.
Neću te pustiti da je ubiješ!
OK? Ona nosi moje dijete.
Imam neizlječivi rak dojke.
Dr. Cottle će potvrditi dijagnozu.
Ostalo mi je još par mjeseci života.
Viper 289,....
Kako se osjećaš danas?
Divno.
I mislio sam da ću te naći ovdje.
Karl Agathon.
Želiš sjesti?
Možda drugi put.
Znači on je ljubavnik cylonke.
Znaš što? Živo mi se
hebe koga ili što on hebe.
Spasio je moju guzicu tamo dole.
Kako se itko može zaljubiti u toster?
Kao što su i svi ostali...
snimali Sharon, prije nego je
smjestila 2 metka u Adamina prsa.
Kurvini sinovi se
zahebavaju sa tvojom glavom.
Aha. Pitaj samo šefa.
Znao sam.
Nepopravljivo smeće.
Treba mi piće.
Pocrnio,odmoan, spreman. Vidi se.
Odmoran, ako ništa drugo. Ništa
nisam radio osim jeo i spavao.
"Neovlaštena uporaba ručnog
oružja"? Koja glupa optužba.
Znam.
Trebali su ti dati medalju
za ubijanje toga tostera.
Šefe.
Čuo sam da si završila
u zatvoru zbog mene.
Zaboravite.
- Želim da znaš...
- Zaboravi.
Trebam sve (nešto
nešto) koje mogu dobiti.
Sharon je letjela 47 misija u ovome.
I nikad nije naučila sletjet kako spada.
Morao sam vraćati lim nazad
nakon svakog slijetanja.
Prilazi su je činili nervoznom.
Bilo je strah da je gledaš.
Obično i jesam.
Hebiga.
Bježiš sa tri gore? Jesi lud?
Ne kad igram protiv tebe.
Skala crvenih prinčeva, zar ne?
Koliko već igram sa ovim
kartama, znam im svaki pregib.
Život je kurva.
I što ćeš, plakat zbog toga?
Ne, samo želim završiti, ok?
Loša hrana, smjene koje ne prestaju...
pretvaranje da je partija
karata vrhunac dana.
To ne može trajati vječno,
zar ne? Zemlja je tamo negdje.
Je.
Možda se samo motamo uokolo, ganjajući
slike sa polovnog planetarija.
I svi vi možete u pakao.
Idem naći Heloa.
Dobra ideja.
Možda ga je ona cylonska
kurva naučila kojem triku.
Pazi amo, šefe.
Nisam nikad namjeravao da Sharon i ja...
Znaš, to je nekako evoluiralo.
Samo dvoje zaljubljenih klinaca, znaš?
Znam što je osjećala prema tebi.
Voli te.
Je li ti ispričala i ostatak plana?
Ona i ja bi ostali
zajedno nakon vojnog roka.
Znaš, onda bi se i vjenčali. Možda...
bi imali i djece.
Pretpostavljam da sam sao
jedan veliki idiot, ne?
Vjerojatno je hebeni toster
ovo planirao od početka.
- Ne zovi je tako.
- Nekog morona...
da joj napravi dijete.
Znaš što, znaš? Trebao
bih ti biti zahvalan.
Biti zahvalan.
Znaš zašto?
Jer je ta nakaza u njenom
trbuhu mogla biti moja.
Hej, jesi dobro?
Oprosti.
Kurvin ...
Dosta, šefe!
Ja ću reći kad je dosta!
Dosta!
Dođi amo, prokleti ljubitelju tostera!
nI NE ZNAM ZAŠTO SAM LJUT NA TEBE.
Moja Sharon je mrtva.
Ona stvar u zatvoru...
to nije Sharon.
Razumio, plavi vođo.
Kakvi ste sa gorivom?
Što je koji kuac to?
To smo mi, gdine. Ali ne
mogu naći izvor transmisije.
Nešto pokreće naš komunikacijski
sustav i emitira automatski signal.
Koji cylonci mogu
uhvatiti i locirati nas.
Pretpostavimo da je tako.
Obnivi i pošalji dalje...
koordinate za hitni skok,
u slučaju da se pojave.
Dee, daj mi....
- Dobro sam.
- Ne, ne, ostani dole.
Dobro sam, gdine.
Odvest ćemo te do dra Cottlea..
- da te pregleda.
- Gdine Gaeta, saznajte što se dogodilo.
Dobro sam.
Gdine Gaeta.
Strujni udar je spalio ploču.
Sustav je bio prevrtljiv
otkad su cylonci upali u njega.
Gdine Gaeta, ovo je
više od prevrtljivosti.
Zapovjednik je u pravu.
Ako treba pregledat liniju
po liniju koda, napravi tako.
Popravi to.
Oprostite?
Čuo si me.
Gdine, pokrenut je sav
dijagnostički alat što imamo.
Provjera svake linije
mogla bi potrajati danima.
Ne zanimaju me isprike. Popravi to!
To nije isprika. To je hebena činjenica!
Gdine Gaeta.
Da, gdine.
Saberite se.
Žao mi je, gdine.
Koje je njegov hebeni problem?
Mjesecima bježimo, i
što im možemo pokazati.
Žrtve.
- Sve lošije stanje.
- Posadi treba odmor.
Napokon ih pogađa, to je sve.
Stari životi su nestali.
Jedino čemu se možemo nadati je ovo.
Alo, šefe, gdje je 289?
Treba mi za vježbu danas.
Brod je prizemljen, gdine.
Što? Na koliko dugo?
Zauvijek.
Spašavamo što možemo,
ali taj brod više ne leti.
Prokletstvo, treba mi taj brod.
Što da vam akžem, kapetane?
Nosači motora su pogođeni.
Brtve kokpita su popucale.
Da je taj brod konj...
- Shvaćam, šefe.
- Upucao bih ga.
Šefe, surađuj sa mnom. Treba
mi tvoja pomoć, i treba mi brod.
Što želite da napravim,
da radimo dok ne crknemo?
Ne, samo dajte sve od sebe.
Nitko ne očekuje čuda.
Možda je to problem.
Hebi ga. Zašto ne?
Što se događa, šefe?
U redu, evo što je.
Izgradit ćemo novi lovac.
A što je sa drugim brodovima?
Već kasnim tri dana sa popravcima.
Ovo je izvannastavni projekt.
Ni jedna minuta radnog
vremena se ne troši na ovo.
Shvaćate?
Misliš da to možemo?
Ja ne bih znao ni gdje početi.
- Što još ima novog?
- Oh, hebi se.
U redu, on priča o proizvodnji okvira..
avionike,
To je hebeno nemoguće.
Znate onda što?
Zaboravite. Ne trebate mi.
Šefe, čekaj. Nismo tako mislili..
Rekoh, zaboravite.
Nazad na posao.
To je zapovijed.
Koliko mi je vremena ostalo?
Tjedni. Najviše mjesec.
Hoću li moći raditi?
Da, ako rak ne dođe do
mozga. Ako dođe, vi...
Netko je agresivan.
Šuti i pucaj.
Bogovi, između tebe i Racetracka,
voditi razgovor je..
poput hodanja minskim poljem.
A ti si zadnja osoba koja bi
mi trebala govoriti o manirima.
Koliko čujem, pritiskaš šefa Tyrola.
Dovuci.
Samo sam ga podsjetio
da očekujem da radovi na
održavanju vipera ne pate zbog njegovog
hobija.
Lijepo!
Iznenađena sam da te nije udario.
Hajde, Starbuck.
Ne misliš da će ta gomila
smeća stvarno poletjeti?
50 kubita na to da će poletjeti.
Da?
A tko će voziti? Ja sigurno neću.
Ne gledaj mene.
Nisam gledala tebe.
Molim?
Ja ću ga voziti.
Ti?
Ja.
Zašto?
Zato što...
dok svi ostali samo stoje i cmizdre...
Mi cmizdrimo?
šef radi nešto pozitivno.
Duboko sam dirnut.
- Stvarno?
- Ozbiljno, jesam.
Usne su mu poplavile.
Sličiš na borovnicu.
Nema kisika.
Ovdje nema kisika!
Nema kisika.
Pištolj je prazan.
Lijep pogodak.
Sustav za održanje života je odlučio...
da je streljena pod prevelikim tlakom...
i počeo je ispuštati zrak.
Još 2 minute, i bili bi mrtvi.
Padovi napona, kvarovi opreme.
Gdine, mislim da sam našao uzrok.
Koji je?
Cylonska logička bomba.
Heuristički računalni virus.
Sposoban je učiti...
evoluirati, i vjerojatno
je na svakom računalu...
na brodu, samo čeka na aktivaciju.
Nema sumnje da je zaostao
onda kada su cylonci upali
u mrežu koju je pukovnik Tigh
postavio onog dana kada
ste bili upucani, gdine.
To je bilo prije par tjedana.
Zašto tek sada?
Najvjerojatnije mu je
trebalo vremena da probije...
naše lozinke i kodove.
I kad je jednom to uspio...
počeo je testrati svoje sposobnosti
kontrole naših sustava,..
električnog, održanja života.
Kako ćeš ga ubiti?
Pa, to je zeznuti dio.
Ako je to cylonski virus, onda će
biti ekstremno teško istrijebiti ga.
Pa, pretpostavljam da
sam jako sretan jer...
imam stručnjaka za to na brodu.
Reci Helou da ovo
pokaže našem zatvoreniku.
Hajde. Hajde.
Kurvin sine.
Mogu sam, vrati se na posao.
Ovo je posao za dvojicu, šefe.
Hoćeš ovo krilo postavljeno, ili nećeš?
Na 3. 1, 2, 3.
Divno. Pridrži to tamo.
Gdine?
Strujni udari se
nastavljaju događati ...
i oprema otkazuje po cijelom brodu.
Hvala vam.
Trebali bi prijeći u
stanje uzbune i staviti
timove za kontrolu štete u pripravu.
Ne još.
Jesi li vidio taj brod što ga šef gradi?
Njegov zamišljeni lovac? Ne trebam ga
vidjeti da znam da je to gubljenje vremena.
Mehaničari ne misle tako.
Trebamo se koncentrirati
na flotu koju imamo,
a ne gubiti se u
nekakvom inžinjerskom snu.
Trebali bismo to prekinuti.
Možda i hoćemo.
Ali taj projekt im daje nešto.
Neću im to oduzeti...
dok ne budem morao.
Dr. Cottle kaže da sam u redu.
Želim nešto udarati.
OK.
Ne koči se. Ne budi ukočen.
Okreni.
I spusti koljeno.
Pažnja, Galactica.
- Izboj struje na palubi 12.
- Nije li to lijepo.
Sad.
Ako ih želiš baciti, gledaj mene.
Uhvati ruke. Zgrabi zglob.
Učvrsti ruku.
I samo spusti koljeno i okreni za 45.
OK.
- Jesi dobro?
- Da.
Baš kao što smo radili na pripremama.
Uključimo živog protivnika.
I baci nož.
Billy...
Hej.
Koliko dugo si na brodu?
Upravo stigoh.
Sjećaš li se kad si bila sa
šefom, prije napada cylonaca?
Da.
Žao mi je. Pitao si.
Voliš li ga još?
Helo.
Ti si otac moga djeteta.
Ti si mi prvi u srcu.
I ništa to neće promijeniti, ikada.
U redu...
moramo ovo proći.
Dr. Baltar kaže da je to neka
vrsta cylonske logičke bombe.
Vidiš li išta?
Možeš li okrenuti?
Sharon ?
Sharon.
Sharon?
Sharon .
Sharon!
Moram razgoverati sa
zapovjednikom Adamom. Odmah.
Zašto?
To je cylonski virus.
Proučava vaše sustave,
testira ih, prilagođava se...
traži slabe točke.
Da napravi što?
Da okrene Galactičine
sustave protiv vas samih.
Sudari vas sa drugim brodom,..
detonira skladišta eksploziva,..
uguši posadu.
A što je sa tobom, sa bebom?
Ja sam za njih nepoznanica,
greška.
Helo, ova logička bomba će
eksplodirat u roku par sati.
Jednom kad to napravi,
cylonci će nas naći.
I pobiti nas sve.
Zapovjedniče Adama...
Štogod imaš za reći, napravi to brzo.
Pa, mrzim to reći, ali
kokpit je predaleko iza.
Imat će CG problema kod manevara.
Ne gradimo ga za okretnost.
Predviđen je za brzinu.
A uz to...
nisi ni mislio da će ikada poletjeti.
Pa, neće, pogotovo ne sa
kokpitom zabijenim u...
Dee?
Hej.
Što radiš ovdje?
Komunikacije, pretpostavljam.
Šef je dobar sa hidraulikom, ali..
ovaj komunikacijski sustav je očajan.
Pozor.
Morao sam to vidjeti svojim očima.
Još malo pa če kompletni
most doći u razgledanje.
I ti radiš na ovom
školskom projektu, Apollo?
Ne.
Lijepo da barem netko ovdje
ima malo pameti u glavi.
Gdje je šef, u alatnici?
Otišao je malo odspavati, gdine.
Što je ovo, šefe?
Pravim otapalo za čišćenje
motornih dijelova, gdine.
Otapalo, kuac. Njušim alkohol.
Što namjeravaš?
Treba mi alkohol za
razmjenu za dijelove.
Većinu dijelova imam ovdje,
ali mi trebaju motori.
Znam da mi treba dozvola
zapovjednika Adame
da ih skinem sa olupina.
Imao motore ili ne...
oboje znamo da taj komad
smeća neće nikad poletjeti.
Moram pokušati, pukovniče.
Zašto?
Jer taj brod, posao na njemu,
je sve što mi je ostalo.
Ako ne budem imao to, ja..
Umalo zaboravih. Obećao sam
XOu Baah Pakala da ću mu pomoći.
Gdine?
Ima neke stare DDG-62 motore...
koji mu zauzimaju prostor.
Vjerojatno su smeće...
no rekao sam mu da ću poslati ekipu...
da ih odvuče, što prije.
Rado ću vam pomoći, gdine.
Dobro.
Gdjo predsjednice,
vaš shuttle je spreman.
Dobro.
Hvala vam što ste mi
prepustili vaše prostorije.
Nema na čemu.
Željela sam vam vratiti ovo.
To je bio poklon.
" Nikad ne posuđuj knjigu", znam. Ali...
predugo je kod mene.
Pripada vašoj zbirci.
Kasnim na sastanak Quoruma.
Imamo problema?
Naša računala su zaražena
cylonskim virusom,..
koji uništava sustave na cijelom brodu.
Upravo su me obsvijestili da je to...
samo uvod za napad cylonaca.
Pretpostavljam da ste
ga pokušali onesposobiti.
Gdin Gaeta i podpredsjednik
upravo rade na tome.
Ne nadam se uspjehu.
Zapovjedniče, ne znam što vam
mogu ponuditi osim moralne potpore.
U stvari, gdjo predsjednice...
trebao bi mi savjet.
Želite napraviti što?
Potpuno izbrisati sve diskove,
ponovo pokrenuti cijeli brodski sustav,
i vratiti ga sa predratnih back-upa.
I ostaviti nas sa spuštenim
hlačama dok sve ne proradi.
Zapovjednik nikad neće pristati na to.
Već sam razgovarao sa njim, gdine.
- Što je rekao?
- Da će to razmotriti.
To je jedini način da uništimo virus.
Mislio sam da je zapovjednik
rekao da se ne miješaš u ovo.
Žao mi je, no želite li
preživjeti ili ne, pukovniče?
U redu...
onda izračunajmo koordinate za skok i napravimo
neku udaljenost od cylonskih kurviša...
Ne, gdine, ne možemo riskirati skok.
Svi sustavi su zaraženi,
uključujući i navigaciju.
Virus bi nas mogao baciti u neko sunce.
Nestaje nam vremena...
uskoro će naš signal
uhvatiti cylonska flota.
Ako ne smislimo što prije toga...
preuzet će kontrolu
nad našim sustavima...
i pobiti nas na sto načina.
Dolazim iz zatvora...
razgovarao sam sa našim
cylonskim zatvorenikom.
Nudi nam rješenje problema.
I pitate se možete li joj vjerovati.
Morao sam se savladati da..
joj ne stavim ruke oko grla.
Ne mogu vjerovati da razmišljate o tome.
Znam da su cylonci
stručnjaci za manipulaciju.
Napravit će sve da te zbune.
Ovo nije ista ona koja me je upucala.
Mogu li stvarno biti toliko različiti?
Zapovjedniče, ako me
pitate je li moguće...
da vam je rasuđivanje
pomućeno prošlim...
događajima sa ovim istim modelom, pa..
moram reći da je.
Mi smo ih stvorili.
Uvijek postoji šansa da
bismo se mogli dogovoriti.
Moramo raditi brzo. Živimo
na posuđenom vremenu.
Pusti je.
Da, gdine.
Dee...
Imaš li još uvijek
stari očev džepni nožić?
Daj joj ga.
Gdine Gaeta...
možete li me priključiti
na optički kabel?
Trebam pristup svim frekvencijama i
direktni dodir sa glavnim računalom.
Napravi to.
Gdine.
Izvoli, Sharon.
Hvala.
Dradis .
Evo ih dolaze.
Višestruke mete.
Smijer 371, kut 552.
Cylonski lovci.
Kurvini sinovi su nas našli.
Lansiraj Vipere.
Apollo, lovci čekaju.
Galactica, Apollo.
Lovci drže formaciju.
Ponavljam, lovci drže formaciju.
Što koji kuac?
U redu, ovako će to raditi.
Lovci će poslati signal
za aktivaciju virusa.
To će potrajati par sekundi.
Na moj znak, počni
sa brisanjem računala.
Promašimo li taj prozor...
virus će zauzeti svaki sustav na brodu.
Ponekad treba oštro zaigrati.
Zar ne, zapovjedniče?
Što koji kuac ona radi?
Uspostavili su kontako, gdine.
Miče se prebrzo, ne mogu pratiti.
Moramo ovo zaustaviti.
Pripremi se za brisanje
računala, na moju zapovijed.
Sustavi spremni, gdine.
Briši sve tvrde diskove, sada.
Napravi to.
Bogovi, što li to rade?
Oružje još nije aktivirano.
Nema dradisa.
Sustavi su pali.
Ovo će biti prokleto krvoproliće.
Nemamo nikakvu obranu.
Apollo, Hotdog. Dolaze!
U redu, primio, Hotdog.
Bogovi, ima ih na stotine.
Cylonci se primiču.
Smjestila nam je!
Daj mi tvoj pištolj.
Da.
Ako dolaze po tebe, bit će razočarani.
Napravi to.
Što čekaš?
Ovo.
Što koji kuac?
Upravo smo emitirali signal.
Galactica?
Oni...kao da su izgubili snagu.
Lete bez kontrole!
Što koji kuac?
Cylonci su poslali virus.
A mi smo im vratili drugi.
Apollo, ovdje Galactica.
Pobijte kurvine sinove.
Jes! Navali, mala!
Razumio.
Viperi, slobodna paljba.
Sad.
Ovo...ovo je izravnavanje računa.
Da!Kako ti se ovo sviđa?
Vidiš ovo?
Sredio sam ovog tostera.
Hajde!
Ima još toga odakle je ovo došlo!
Dečki, počistimo ih! Hajde, krenimo.
Časnici.
Da, gdine.
Odvedite ovu stvar nazad u ćeliju.
Evo, šefe.
Lijepo je biti mal, a?
Brod ima više od jednog motora.
Prioni uz to.
Tako smo blizu.
Mora biti nekog viška metala negdje....
kojeg bi mogli upotrijebiti za oklop.
Podne ploče, suvišne pregrade, bilo što.
Većima toga treba za popravak vipera.
Tko kaže da trebaš metal?
- Ugljični slitine (pazi izraza :))
- Dobro si se sjetio, Helo.
Teško će ga biti vidjeti na dradisu
no pitanje je, hoće li poletjeti?
Samo me gledaj.
Uređaji...
sve zeleno.
Pritisak goriva....
normalan.
Apollo, Starbuck.
Crna ptica može poletjeti.
Provjera.
Magnetna brava osigurana,
počinje poletna sekvenca.
Da se nisi usudio raspasti, kurvin sine.
Možeš poletjeti.
Crna ptica je krenula.
Hej.
Hej.
Lakše malo. Kreni polako.
Testiraš brod.
Ne pokazivaš letačka umijeća.
Ni ne namjeravam.
Bogovi, a što je ovo?
Što hoćeš dokazati?
Ništa ne želim dokazati.
Zahebavaš me.
O, Bogovi.
OK.
Da vidimo što ova beba može.
Gdje si, Starbuck?
Čuješ li me, Starbuck?
Starbuck!
Nestala je.
Galactica, Apollo, izgubio
sam je. Izgubio sam je.
Nema je na dradisu.
Starbuck,...
Starbuck,gdje si?
Starbuck,javi se.
Starbuck,čuješ me?
Kara, jesi u redu?
Naravno da si me izgubio.
Ovo je hebeni nevidljivi
brod, sjećaš se?
O, ti...
Zapovjednik na palubi.
Nastavite.
Šefe Tyrol?
Ovo je Crna ptica?
Da, gdjo.
Gdjo predsjednice, čast mi je.
Ne, meni je časti.
Nevjerojatan je.
Samo običan brod, gdjo.
Preskroman si. Nakon
svega što smo prošli...
bilo bi lako odustati, izgubiti nadu.
Ali ne i ovdje.
Ne danas.
Ovo je više od broda, šefe.
Ovo je čin vjere.
Ovo je dokaz...
da, usprkos svemu što izgubismo..,
da ćemo nastaviti pokušavati.
I da ćemo proći sve ovo..
svi mi, zajedno,
obećavam.
Zapovjedniče.
Gdjo predsjednice.
Ovo je trebalo...
biti iznaneđenje, no....
pa...
Hvala.
Ako ćete nas počastiti,
gdjo predsjednice.
Naravno.
OK.
Zezam se.
Luda ideja, uporaba uglične slitine.
Dobar posao.
Lijep uradak.
To je bilo slatko.
Htjeli su to napraviti za vas.
Hvala vam.
Ništa ovo ne bi bilo moguće
da nisi vjerovao cyloncu.
Poslušao sam vaš savjet..
i našli smo zajednički cilj.
Koji je to bio?
Oboje smo htjeli preživjeti.
Bojni položaji, bojni položaji.
Stanje jedan za cijeli brod.
Ovo nije vježba.
Ponavljam: Bojni položaji.
Pa, gdjo predsjednice,izgleda da
ste pogodili krivi dan za posjetu.
Ovdje Zapovjednik. Izvješæe.
Nepoznata letjelica u
dometu dradisa, zapovjednièe.
Prema velièini izgleda da je cylonski bazna
zvijezda. Lovci su krenuli presresti je.
Uzbuni flotu, neka hitno skoèe.
I ja i predsjednica dolazimo.
Galactica, Apollo, idem prema
baznoj zvijezdi. Kat je uz mene.
Predviðam minuta do presreta.
Primio, Apollo.
Podrška je lansirana i bit
æe vam iza leða za tri minuta.
Izvješæe.
Lovci su poletjeli.
Novi kontakt na dradisu. I
njihovi lovci su poletjeli.
Koliko do skoka?
Još 2 minute.
Gdine...gdine, primam
Kolonijalni signal.
Kolonijalni?
K vragu, koriste naše
vlastite signale protiv nas.
Možda. Prièekaj sa
paljbom. Zadrži i skok.
Imaš neki predosjeæaj, a?
Vidjet æemo.
Svi brodovi, ovdje Galactica, nemojte
skakati. Ponavljam, nemojte skakati.
Direktna veza, Kolonijalni
prioritetni kanal.
Pošalji standardni napadaèi
signal i pusti odgovor na zvuènike.
Pažnja, nepoznati brode.
Ovo je Galactica. Identificiraj
se, ili æemo otvoriti vatru.
Udaljenost 1700, gdine.
Ovdje Pegasus, zove brod koji tvrdi da
je Galactica. Molimo vas, odgovorite.
Pegasus, je li to moguæe?
Cijela flota je uništena.
Daj mi direktnu vezu. Pegasus, ovdje Galactièin
zapovjednik. Potvrdite identitet PINom, odmah.
Gdine, primam Kolonijalni
PIN. Autentièan je.
Galactica, ovdje zapovjednik
Pegasusa. Adama, jesi li to ti?
Admiral Cain. Zadovoljstvo
Vam je èuti glas.
Prekini napad.
Crveni tim, prekini napad.
Crveni tim, prekini napad.
Zapovjednièe. Ne znam
što reæi. Ovo je èudo.
Uzeli ste mi rijeè iz
usta. Prekini stanje jedan.
Galactica, Apollo. neæete vjerovati
što gledam! Ovo je poput sna!
Ovo jest san.
Pegasusov Raptor 861, Galactica. Mlaznice ugašene,
magnet osiguran. Dobrodošli na palubu, Admirale.
U vrstu, ljudi! Izgledajte k'o
vojska! Nije ovo mali odmor!
Požurite, veæ su stigli. Poravnajte
uniforme. Lijepo od tebe što si se pojavila.
Nisam mogla prije.
Grupo! Pozor!
Admirale Cain, dobrodošli na Galacticu.
Zapovjednièe Adama, èast mi je.
Dozvolite da vam predstavim
Predsjednicu Kolonije Lauru Roslin.
Duga je to prièa. Dobrodošli.
Gdjo predsjednice. Zadovoljstvo mi je.
U ime èasnika i posade Pegasusa,
zadovoljstvo mi je vidjeti sve vas.
Dobrodošli nazad u Kolonijalnu flotu.
Kara Thrace.
Kapetan Taylor.
Admirale, gorim od radoznalosti. Ne
ljutite se ako vas zagnjavim pitanjima.
Samo dajte.
Kako ste nas našli?
Ustvari, pratili smo cylonsku flotu. Pokušali smo
predvidjeti njene pokrete, koji su izgledali sluèajni,
dok nismo shvatili da skaèu po sustavima
bogatim rudama. Pa smo i sami poèeli izviðati
takve sustave, nadajuæi se prilici za
udri-i-bježi napadu na njihovu flotu.
No umjesto cylonaca, našli smo vas.
Znaèi, napadali ste njihovu flotu?
Pa, znate što kažu o najblojoj obrani.
Hmmm.
Kako ste izbjegli poèetni
cylonski napad na Kolonije?
Uzet æu još jednu, ako ti ne smeta.
Najbolje sa Galactice.
Ahhh.
Ovo je bolje od razgledavanja. Hvala ti.
Kad vidiš jednu staru Bojnu
zvijezdu, vidio si ih sve.
Pa, da, može se reæi da je stara.
Ne mogu vjerovati da vas cylonci nisu
razjebali u ovoj prastaroj kanti. Oprosti.
I samo zbog toga, ne piješ ovu rundu.
Pristali smo u brodogradilištu Škorpionove
flote. Pripremali se za tromjeseèni remont.
Veæina posade se spremala za
produženi odmor. Zapovijedao je XO.
Ja sam bila u svojoj sobi, završavala neka
izvješæa, i pripremala se za odlazak kuæi na Tauron.
I onda su cylonci napali.Pogodili su
brodogradilište sa 3, možda 4 neuklearke.
5 brodova, 2 od njig Bojne
zvijezde, uništene su na licu mjesta.
A dok sam se vratila na zapovjedni
most, veæ sam izgubila preko 700 ljudi.
Bogovi.
Bili smo posve bez obrane.
Pa sam naredila skok.
Kamo?
Gdjegod. Nigdje. Samo skok.
Slijepi skok. Mogli ste
svi zaginuti. Hrabar potez.
Oèajnièki potez. Nisam vidjela drugi izbor.
No sigurna sam da i vi imate dobru prièu.
No sad nemam vremena za nju.
Pošaljite mi vaše dnevnike.
Na zapovjed, gdjo.
Nešto nije u redu?
Ne. Samo ponekad
zaboravljam vojni protokol.
Admiral cain je moj nadreðeni èasnik. Ona æe
preuzeti potpuno zapovjedništvo nad flotom.
Pitala sam se kako da doðem do te teme.
Vjeruj mi, mada je zapovjedni lanac striktan,
nije bezdušan. A nisam ni ja. Ovo je tvoj brod,
i ne namjeravam se miješati u unutarnje stvari.
Cijenim to, Admirale.
Gdjo predsjednice, izgledate
kao da sam vam ubila psa.
Ne, samo...samo, zapovjednik
i ja smo dosta prošli skupa.
Isprièajte me. Gdjo Predsjednice?
Da. Isprièajte me. Admirale, ne mogu opisati koliko sam
zahvalna što ste sa nama. Hvala vam što ste nas našli.
Gdjo predsjednica.
Ministrica obrazovanja?
Napredovala je puno od tada.
Sigurna sam da je.
Prièaj mi o Admiralu Cain.
Èasni èasniku?
Naravno.
Krenuli smo na nešto što smo mislili da je
cylonski komunikacijski relej. Lagana meta, ne?
Ispalo je da nije relej. Bilo je to okupljalište
15 cylonskih odreda, prepunih lovaca.
Ops.
Admiral cain je naredila XOu da napadne. Njih
dvoje su bili vrlo bliski. Bio joj je XO godinama.
Ali caka je u ovom...
odbio je izvršiti zapovjed.
Admirale Cain. Imamo cylonskog
zarobljenika na brodu.
Stvarno? I mi imamo jednog.
Naš se pokazao kao dobar izvor
informacija. Odlièno suraðuje.
Potpredsjednik, dr.
Balthar, je radio sa njom.
Što je napravila?
Uzela je njegov pištolj, i pred cijelom posadom
ga upucala u glavu. I okrenula se prema meni.
I što si ti napravio?
Pa, zapovjedio sam hebeni napad. Što misliš da
sam napravio? Ne, ne, samo se šalim. Zeza, ok?
Nije mi zadovoljstvo lišiti te
zapovjedništva, Bille, znaj to.
Ni ne rezmišljajte o tome, Admirale.
Jesu li ovo recke ubijenih? Vi
stavljate recke na bokove lovaca?
- Neprevedeni titl
-
Ne vidiš me da ih crtam po lovcu i
hvalim se cijeloj hebenoj galaksiji.
Gle, ovdje ima 48 srušenih.
Divno. Printate li i majice?
Gdje je CAG sa Galactice?
Ovdje.
Da èujem o vašem odredu, kapetane.
Vidim da ne brojite srušene.
Trebali bi poèeti
- to podiže moral, potièe natjecateljski duh, jaèa vojsku.
Pa, to je jedna od ideja.
To je ideja admirala Caina. A to znaèi
da je sada to i tvoja ideja.Kapetane.
Ime mog zapovjednika je Adama, što je
lako zapamtiti, jer je to i moje ime.
Aha, sjetit æu se toga, tatin
deèko. Da vidim vašu listu zaduženja.
Postavili su me na èelo cylonskog projekta.
Glavni fokus mi je otkrivanje cylonaca.
Mi imamo svog cylonskog zarobljenika. Želim da
ga što prije pregledate. Izvucite štogod iz njega.
Pitam se tko æe taj cylonac biti...
stranac, poznanik, vjerni prijatelj
koji iznenada postade neprijatelj?
Jeste me èuli?
Da,da, stvarno æu..vrlo æu
rado ispitati zatvorenika.
Admirale.
Admirale, žao mi je.
To je jedna ružna beba.
Molim?
Ne smeta vam ako malo pogledam? Ja
sam Laird, šef mehanièara sa Pegasusa.
O, samo daj. Ja sam Tyrol. Hvala na poslanim
dijelovima. Da, gledaj što god želiš.
DDG-62ice. Mamu mu.. Ja sam ih dizajnirao. Mislio
sam da su ih izbacili iz upotrebe brije 10 godina.
Ti si aeronautièki inžinjer?
Bio sam. A onda se dogodio rat, i mene
su unovaèili. I sad sam šef mehanièara.
Znaèi, ti si u biti
civil? Kako se to dogodilo?
Bio sam na Scylli, i pokupio
nas je Pegasus. Dogodilo se.
Hoæe ti smetati ako se uvuèem unutra. Èuo sam
da si je sam dizajnirao. Volio bih vidjeti kako.
U redu, samo naprijed.
Pegasus je nadopunio Galacticu iz
svoje rezerve, za vojne operacije.
Sa èine se slažem, ali kad æe dio tih
zaliha poèeti dolaziti do ostatka flote?
Pa, Cainka me uvjerava
da su te zalihe na putu.
Pa, barem sa tobom razgovara.
Meni se ne želi javiti.
Skrenut æu joj pažnju na to.
Kako se nosiš sa svim ovim?
Ona ima veæi èin. To
je tako jednostavno.
Znaš, da je predsjednik Adar izašao iz onog Raptora, bila
bih sretna, zahvalna da neko drugi preuzme. Ali ipak...
Ne idem do "ali ipak" dijela. Primam zapovijedi
cijeli život. Ovo nije ništa drukèije.
Pa, onda, zapovjednièe, hvala vam.
Cijenit æemo sve što nam možete dati.
Dobit æete.
Zvuèi kao da ste obojica bili pijani.
Bez pogovora. Ali nije
lagao, u to sam siguran.
Nadam se da ne brzaš sa zakljuècima.
Èekajmo èinjenice. Kontekst je bitan.
Kontekst?
Upucala je èasnika ispred posade.
Mi smo srušili cijeli civilni brod.
sa gotovo 1000 ljudi
na njemu. Tako tu piše.
To je bilo drugaèije. A i ne
znamo je li na njemu bilo ljudi.
Zato se i nadam da æe Cainka proèitati
cijeli dnevnik i shvatiti kontekst.
Mogli bi pitati Cainku njene
dnevnike, tako da i mi imamo kontekst.
Ne bi li to bilo lijepo?
Ne približujte se. Ubilo je sedmoricu
dosad. Želite li da sa vama budu èuvari?
Bojiš se, Gaiuse? Želiš li velike jake vojnike
kraj sebe da te štite od starog zlog cylonca?
Ne, hvala.
O, bože.
Bože, Gaius, to sam ja.
Vidi što su joj uèinili.
Otvorite vrata, odmah, molim.
ID potvrðen. Poruènik Thorne.
Sigurno se opirala. Sigurno se borila.
To ne opravdava ovo.
Prestani.
Halo? Halo, èuješ li me?
Oèito je zlostavljana i muèena.
Da.
Nema znakova traume glave. Voljno micanje
oka znaèi postojanje svjesne kontrole.
Ne možeš ne biti znanstvenik na tren i
pogledati ovu zlostavljanu ženu pred tobom?
Gle, slušaj, znam da
je ovo teško za tebe.
Ne popuj mi.
Ne popujem. Pokušavam te urazumiti. Ako
joj želim pomoæi, prvo je moram razumjeti.
Hoæeš li joj pomoæi, Gaiuse?
Napravit æu sve što mogu. Napokon, nevjerojatno
je slièna nekome do koga mi je jako stalo.
Mislim da bi bilo
najbolje da nas napustiš.
Nema ozbiljnih povreda glave, i time nikakvih fizièkih
ozljeda neuralnih puteva ili kognitivnih centara.
Ali je oèito traumatizirano, što upuæuje na to da je
trenutno stanje psihièkog porijekla. jeste li mislili na to?
Ne. To pokazuje da je cylonska svjesnost
isto tako podložna stresu poput ljudske,
i da se može manipulirati
njome na isti naèin.
Jednostavno reèeno, Admirale, do sada ste
upotrebljavali štap. Vrijeme je za mrkvu.
Dajte doktoru sve što mu treba.
Da, gdjo.
Zapovjednièe, èitajuæi vaše dnevnike, èini
mi se da ste prošli kroz sito i rešeto.
Bilo je takvih trenutaka.
Pa, možete se ponositi uèinjenim.
Hvala, Admirale.
Kao što sam vam rekla, pratili smo
cylonsku flotu kad smo vas našli.
I sad kad usporedim njihovu rutu sa
vašom, oèito je da su oni pratili vas.
Naši izviðaèi kažu da im je flota
sastavljena od 2 bazna broda, i 12ak drugih.
i jednog velikog broda kojeg
još nismo identificirali.
Interesira me tej veliki brod.
Što radi? Je li to zapovjedni brod?
Ili tvornica lovaca?
Moguæe. Štogod bilo, cylonci ga štite.
To ja zovem zanimljivom metom.
Hmmm. A ja sam veæ pripremila cijelu prièu
o ujedinjavanju snaga za napadaèku misiju.
Bilo koja šansa da udrem cylonce gdje ih boli...moje
zadovoljstvo. Apollo æe koordinirati sa vašim CAGom.
Što me vodi do sljedeæe
teme. Spojit æu posade.
I poèinjem sa premještajem
kapetana Adame na Pegasus.
Imam tim koji odlièno radi.
Ajmo ne okolišat,ok? Nakon pregleda tvojih dnevnika,
mislim da je stavljanje vlastitog sina kao CAGa
bila velika greška.On "ne suraðuje,
buntovan je",a to je èisto citiranje
tvojih dnevnika,da znaš. A
rekla bi da nije samo on problem
Tu je Kara Thrace koja "èesto udara ostale
èasnike i ne sluša zapovijedi". Poruènik Agathon
"Pobratimljuje sa neprijateljem, i èak je
napumpao jednog". A o tvom XO da ne govorim.
I tako...evo kompletne
liste premještaja.
Mislio sam da ste rekli da nemate želje
za miješanjem u moje zapovjedništvo.
Spašavam tvoje zapovjedništvo, Bille. Previše
si blizak sa njima, i to te èini slijepim
za njihove slabosti i za štetu
koju nanose moralu i zajedništvu.
Ne slažem se.
Pa, to je zasigurno tvoje
pravo. Imate zapovjedi.
Premještaj na Peasus?
Za koji hljebac bi to napravili?
Jer su vam to zapovijedi.
Ne možete joj dopustit da samo uleti i shebe
nam raspored taman kad organiziramo akciju...
To je gomila sranja! Samo nas shebava jer je
njen CAG ukoèeni idiot sa metlom u šupku...
Dosta! Vi ste èasnici. Poènite se tako
ponašati. Dala je zapovijed. Izvršite je.
Mogu li govoriti otvoreno?
Ne. Navikli smo se da kršimo pravila, radimo na
našu ruku, propuštamo kroz prste. No s tim je gotovo.
Nosite uniformu; prihvatit æete pravila
koja idu uz nju. Premješteni ste.
Skupite svoje stvari i javite
se Pegasusovom CAGu. Otpust.
Ovo je izviðaèka misija. Zanima nas odreðeni
cylonski brod, veæi od ikojeg dosad viðenih.
Analiza ukazuje da bi mogli biti u ovom
sustavu. Sakrit æemo se iza ovog mjeseca koji ima
neprirodno velik magnetni trag i njime
maskirati naše signale na dradisu.
Gasimo motore, skrivamo se blizu
površine, èekamo da flota priðe.
Starbuck? Želiš nešto dodati?
Plan vam je loš. A cylonci nisu
glupi. Taj mjesec je slijepa toèka.
Nikad mu neæe priæi. Želite im se približiti?
Upotrijebite nevidljivi lovac sa Galaktice.
Limenu kantu iz kuæne radinosti?
Dosta. Starbuck, ne ideš na ovu misiju.
Whiplash, Thumper, pripremite opremu za snimanje.
Apollo, ti æeš voziti mog Raptora. Oznake na jakni
kažu da si uèio upravljati njime. Sijeæaš li se još?
Da, gdine.
Dobro. Otpust.
Oèekivaju da ovo pokorno prihvatimo? I ti
sad voziš hebenog Raptora. Ponižavaju nas.
Je li to oprema za nadgledanje?
Uzmi crnu pticu. Snimi par
lijepih slika našeg cylonca.
Razumjela.
Nazdravlje!
Šefe, gdje je crna ptica?
Poruènica Thrace ju je izvela. Rekla je
da joj je zapovjeðen test performansi. Što?
Hej, šefe, zaslužuješ hebenu medalju. Nismo
vidjeli piæe mjesecima. Ovo mjesto je tulumara!
O, èuo sam da si i vi imate
cylonca. Èuo sam da je i vaš koka.
Želiš umoèiti malo u to
cylonsko meso,a? Malo o,je-o,je?
Èuj, znate što, dosta
je bilo. Zaèepite, momci.
Oh,osjetljivko. Gajiš
osjeæajæiæe za malu roboticu, ne?
'Ko ste koji kuac vi?
Sijeæaš se kad je Thorne stavio znak
"Molim, uznemiravajte me" na zatvor?
Ja sam bio dvaput na redu.
Sijeæam se. Ležala je tamo,
onako, sa praznim pogledom.
Moraš li o tome?
Ooo, osjetljiva.
To boli.
Koja je funkcija ovog broda?
Ne znam.
Pogledaj bolje. Zašto je važan?
Zašto ga èuvaju dvije bazne zvijezde?
Ja...Ja ne znam.
Misliš da æe nas Thorne
pustit i ovaj put?
Ne, èuo sam da æe je
prvo on sam malo lomit.
Èekaj èekaj èekaj.
'Ko u kuac je Thorne?
Poruènik Thorne, gdine, ispitivaè
cylonaca. Žestoko udara i oni prièaju.
Vaša mala robotica je na redu
za žestoko jahanje. Ji-piii!
Ne ne, ne ne, nemoj.
Promisli. Moramo iæi.
Koji kuac?
Drž' je.
Ne!
Mièi se!
Bježi sa puta!
Mièi se!
Bježi sa puta!
Ne!
Mièi se od nje!
Stani! Stani! Da nijedan nije
napravio neki hebeni pokret!
Ne mièite se! Nemojte se hebeno micati!
Dole! Dole! Na koljena, ruke iza glave!
Odmah! Ruke iza glave.
Odmah! Poslušajte! Odmah!
Mrtav je.
Pegasus, Raptor 923. Napustili smo Galacticu i na
putu smo sa zatvorenicima i tijelom poruènika Thornea.
Stižemo na Pegasus za 3 minute.
Ovdje se dogodio napad,
ovdje bi im trebalo i suditi.
Zapovjednièe, ja ovdje imam najviši
èin, i sudit æe im se na Pegasusu.
Oni su moji ljudi.
Jedan od mojih je mrtav.
Dobro. Oboje imamo svoje mišljenje o
sluèaju, i zato trebamo nezavisni sud.
Oh, nezavisni sud? Isti onaj
koji ste raspustili nakon presude
koja vam nije odgovarala?
A ako se ne varam, i tada
se sudilo šefu Tyrolu.
To su bila druga vremena.
Stvarno su bila. Javit æu
vam se, zapovjednièe. Hvala.
Hvala vam. A sad izlazite.
Hrana je tvoja. Nije trik. Neæu
ti je oduzeti. Znaš, ja...hm..
Samo æu prièati. Ne oèekivam da
odgovaraš. Na Caprici, prije napada..
a ponekad zaboravim na svijet prije napada...znao sam
nekoga--ženu,poput nikoje druge. Bila je jedinstvena--
prekrasna, pametna, senzualna. Kad nije bila u
mom krevetu, bila mi je u glavi. Bila je cylonac.
I promijenila mi je život , toliko da nikad
nisam prestao misliti na nju, doslovno,
Jer je volim. Još i danas, volim je.
A ona izgleda u potpunosti kao ti.
Zovem se Gaius Baltar, i
ovdje sam da ti pomognem.
Provjerite ove koordinate skoka.
Oprostite. Koodinate skoka provjerene.
Izgledate mi malo nefokusirano,
kapetane. Nešto bih trebao znati?
Dva prijatelja su mi
uhapšena i optužena za izdaju.
Preporuèam da to pohranite pod "nije moj problem".
Èeka nas misija. Trebate biti usredotoèeni na nju.
Ma da.
Pegasus, plavi tim, koordinate skoka provjerene.
Spremni a FTL. Skaèemo za 10 minuta, sad.
Išta o šefu, gdine?
Morat æe na sud.
On je dobar èovjek, gdine.
Znam. Napravit æu sve...
Zapovjednièe Adama,
javite se u CIC odmah.
Adama.
Upravo sam govorio sa
Fiskom. Suðenje je gotovo.
Gotovo? Pa kad je poèelo?
Ne znam, ali su ih osudili. Smaknut
æe ih, zbog ubojstva i izdaje.
Želim odred marinaca u Raptoru za 5
minuta. Pripremi lovce za polijetanje.
Imate posla.
Gdine.
Pegasus, Galactica, osigurajte kanal. Zapovjednik
Adama želi razgovarati sa Admiralom Cain.
Izvolite, gdine.
Rekli ste mi da æe imati poštenio
suðenje. Kakvo su to suðenje imali?
Uvjeravam vas da sam ih saslušala. Ocijenila sam
njihove izjave prema onima èuvara, i uzela u obzir
njihove dosjee i preporuke. Bila je to
teška odluka, ali se usuðujem reæi, poštena.
Imaju pravo svoj sluèaj
izložiti ispred porote.
Ja sam glavni èasnik u ratnim uvjetima.
Propisi mi daju široke ovlasti.
Lansirajte lovce.
Možete mi citirati koje god pravilnike.
Neæu vam dozvoliti da smaknete moje ljude.
Preporuèam vam da pozorno
razmotrite tu izjavu, zapovjednièe.
Admirale, Galactica
lansira Vipere i Raptora.
Zapovjednièe,zašto lansirate Vipere?
Molim vas, pobrinite se da Tyrol i Agathon
budu predani mojim marincima èim stignu.
Ne primam zapovijedi od vas.
Zovi to kako hoæeš.
Dolazim po svoje ljude.
Praviš veliku grešku.
Dolazim po svoje ljude.
Bojni položaji.
Admirale, ovo se vrlo brzo
neæe moæi kontrolirati.
Lansirajte lovce. Adama je prešao
preko crte. Nije mi ostavio izbora.
Lansirajte lovce.
Galactica, ovdje Kat. Pegazovi
Viperi idu na mene. Tažim zapovijedi.
Moraš ih pustiti da se sami brane. Mi bi
trebali okrenuti glavne topove na Pegaza.
Galactica, ovdje Kat. Tražim slobodno
otvaranje vatre. Trebamo vašu pomoć.
Kat, ovdje Galactica. Ne pucajte ako na vas nije
pucano. Ponavljam, ne pucajte ako nije pucano na vas.
Galactica, ovdje Kat.
Oni nas zahebavaju ovdje!
Galactica, ovdje Hot Dog.
Jedan od njih me je naciljao.
Hot dog, čuvaj leđa! Iza tebe je!
Izbjegavajući manevri, hajde!
Bogovi prokleli ove hebače!
Ok, morat ćemo promijeniti smijer.
Nacho, Pegaze, ne pucajte prvi.
Stinger, Pegaz, zapovjeđeno je da smijenite kapetana
Adamu sa dužnosti i pomognete u napadu na Galacticu.
Vaše oružje, kapetane. Smijenjeni ste.
Dozvolite da odem straga.
Slobodno.
Ma hajde, zakoči.
Ah! Hebi me! Preplavljuju nas! Galactica,
tražim dopuštenje za otvaranje vatre.
Okreću se za još jedan prolaz. Ponavljam,
tražim dozvolu za otvaranje vatre!
Hajde, Starbuck. Reci
mi da si tamo negdje.
Što koji kuac?
Starbuck...ovdje, što se dovraga događa?
Kontakti na dradisu. Jedan
neprijatelj, gotovo iznad nas.
Identificiraj ga.
Nema odašiljača, nema kodova raspoznavanja,
mora da je cylonski lovac, gdine.
Admirale, ovo mora biti cylonac.
Pa, kako se uspio privući ovako
blizu da ga nismo primjetili?
Ne znam, gdjo, kao
da se samo stvorio tu.
U redu. Opozovi vipere. Okreni brod. I
pripremi se za okršaj sa neprijateljem.
Svim Pegazovim viperima,
hitno vas opozivam.
Cylonski lovac je iznad vas.
Pozor svim Galacticinim
viperima,cylonski lovac ide prema vama.
O tu si, prokletinjo! Pratite me!
Brzo desno, pun potisak,
penjanje uzduž x osi!
Starbuck svim viperima : ne pucajte!...ponavljam,
ne pucajte! Ja sam prijatelj, ok?
Svi smo mi prijatelji. Pa
hajdemo samo...biti prijatelji.
To nije cylonac, to je onaj vaš špijunski brod.
Tko ga vozi? Nije mu bilo odobreno polijetanje.
Našao si mene pitati.
Ja sam ovdje samo putnik.
Galactica, Kat. To je Crna ptica.
Ponavljam, to je Crna ptica.
Koji kuac je Crna ptica vani?
Vozi je Starbuck.
Poletjela je prije par sati.
Rekla je da ima neke letačke
testove za Admiralicu Cain.
Ne zvuči vjerojatno.
Ah, opet izvodi neku
glupost. Hvala bogovima.
Možeš to i ponoviti. Nazovite mi Pegaza.
Ovdje zapovjednik Pegaza, nastavi.
Možeš se ili povući ili ćemo početi
pucati jedni po drugima. Tvoja odluka.
Admirale.
Pričekaj minutu.
Primamo podatke, Admirale.
To je cylonska flota. Jesu li
ovo slike od naše izvidnice?
Ne, gdjo. Izviđačka misija je
opozvana. Ove su sa Crne ptice.
Thrace. Odletjela je i sama obavila cijelo
izviđanje. Bogovi, pogledaj ove slike, Jack.
Zabila je svoj nos ravno u njihove
guzice a oni to nisu ni primjetili.
Admirale...zapovjednik Adama je još na
liniji, i naši lovci još traže zapovijedi.
Hoće li nastaviti sa napadom?
U redu, oboje ćemo opozvati snage. Oba
broda će spustiti razinu pripravnosti na 2.
A onda ćeš mi podnijeti
izvješće, osobno.
Nemam namjere hladiti
jaja u tvom zatvoru.
U redu. Na neutralnom mjestu, na Kolonijalnom
Jedan. Bez pomoćnika. Budi tamo za 15 minuta.
Opozovi lovce, stanje 2.
Tu si.
Uskrsni brod dio I
2x11
Počnimo priznavajući ružnu istinu. Što
se danas dogodilo rezultat je greške
u vodstvu svakoga u ovoj
sobi. Mi smo vođe ove flote.
I kao takvi, moramo biti primjer. Ne smijemo
nastaviti dozvoljavati da sukobi među...
Hajdemo prestat sa frazama. 2
njegova čovjeka ubila su jednog moga
časnika jer su štitili cylonca. Krivi
su, i priznaju to. I pod ovim uvjetima,
ja imam pravo i autoritet da
im sudim, osudim, i kaznim.
A svi znamo da je kazna
za takav zločin smrt.
Naravno, admirale...no duh zakona
traži nešto više od samih egzekucija.
Jeste li to radili vas dvoje proteklih 6
mjeseci? Raspravljali finese kolonijalnih zakona?
Pa, pogodite što, mi smo u ratu! I nemamo
vremena za akademsku raspravu o tome predmetu.
Odmah na stvar, u redu. Ti imaš
Pegaza, on Galacticu. 2 teško naoružana,
veoma moćna broda. Sad, prilično sam
sigurna da bi u takvoj borbi Pegaz pobijedio.
Ja nisam tako siguran u to.
No sigurno bi bilo teških
oštećenja i velikih žrtava.
Pa se onda možeš ili boriti sa
Galacticom ili se možete dogovoriti.
I to su jedine dvije
opcije na stolu. Točka.
Kako ste vas dvoje uspjeli ovako dugo
preživjeti, nikad neću saznati. U redu.
Poručnica Thrace mi je poslala detaljne izvidničke
informacije o cylonskoj floti. Želim tu flotu.
I trebam Galacticu da je dobijem. Pa sam spremna ići
tako daleko i odgoditi smaknuće do poslije napada.
I ja ih želim nazad na Galactici.
Živo mi se hebe što ti hoćeš. Budi hebeno
sretan što i tebe još nisam uhapsila.
Uništenje cylonske flote
će biti naš prioritet.
Nakon toga, naći ćemo se ponovo
ovdje i riješiti ovo. Hvala vam.
Na mjestu odmor, poručnice. Dođite
amo. Imali ste zanimljiv dan.
Unapređujem vas u kapetana i
zapovjednika Pegazovih letača.
Unapređujete me?
Trebam CAGa sa mudima i inicijativom
koji može voditi napad na ovu flotu.
Mislila sam da je Stinger taj. No on je
uspio pustiti kapetana Adamu da vas kontaktira
i vas da izvedete taj let ispred
njegovog nosa, znači, on otpada.
A kapetan Adama, gdjo?
Da budem iskrena, bila sam na
ovoliko od toga da ga strpam u zatvor.
No nisam ga mogla optužiti za išta,
pa sam mu samo ukinula letački status.
Želim ga u svom timu, gdjo.
I dobiješ li uvijek ono što želiš?
Uglavnom...gdjo.
Dobro. I ja. U redu, možeš ga imati.
Čujem da si se bila vratila na Capricu.
Jesam, gdjo. Tamo još ima živih ljudi.
Da, i oni zaslužuju da budu
spašeni. Potpuno se slažem.
U stvari, poći ću korak dalje i
reći da je naš konačni cilj povratak
u 12 kolonija i izbacivanje cylonaca iz
naših domova. Što mislite o tome, kapetane?
Mislim da je to najbolja ideja
koju sam čula cijeli dan, gdjo.
Bojim se da ovo može završiti samo
na jedan način. Moraš je ubiti.
O čemu to pričaš?
Kao što ona kaže, dosta sa politikom.
Vas dvoje ste bili voljni zaratiti danas.
Misliš li da će ona odustati od toga?
Čekati će i udariti te prvom prilikom.
To garantiram. Mrzim što ti ovo
ovako govorim, Bille, no ona je opasna
i jedino što možeš je da je
udariš prije nego ona tebe.
Ja nisam ubojica.
Ne. Ti nisi ubojica, ti si kolonijalni časnik
koji je dao zakletvu da će čuvati ovu flotu.
Što misliš da će napraviti sa civilnom
flotom jednom kad tebe eliminira?
Znaš da sam u pravu. Samo
se ne želiš suočiti sa tim.
Znači, cijeli svijet je poludio?
Razina fluida i elektrolita je nestabilna.
No mislim da će beba biti u redu.
Imaš i slomljeno rebro. Lom debljine vlati,
što znači da će neko vrijeme paklenski boljeti.
No nema trajne štete nakon napada.
Napad. To se tako zove ovih dana?
Oni nisu sa Galactice.
Bili su sa Pegaza. Pa što?
A što je sa Heloom i šefom?
Čula sam glasine da će biti pogubljeni.
Neću dozvoliti da se to dogodi.
A kako ćete to spriječiti? Nije
li Admiral Cain još zapovjednica?
To što se dogodilo tebi
je neoprostivo.
Dogodilo se na mom brodu, pod mojom
paskom. To je moja odgovornost.
Zato ti se želim osobno ispričati. Pobrini
se da bude u redu, a onda je vrati u ćeliju.
Zar nismo dosad trebali biti mrtvi? Svi su
rekli da je smaknuće za sat, a prošlo je bar 2.
A, ja se ne žalim.
Tako. Na koliko ste različitih
načina glupi vas dvojica?
Više nego što možemo izbrojati.
Što se događa, kapetane?
Dobra vijest
- niste mrtvi...još. Ovo je samo odgoda, ne oprost. Sprema se velika operacija,
i streljački odred je
zauzet dok to ne završi.
Da, Stari je poludio zbog vas dvojice.
Ovoliko nas je dijelilo
od rata sa Pegazom.
Hebi me.
Što se koji kuac događa? Mislio
sam da su cylonci neprijatelji.
Da, pa, sad smo to mi.
Što nije u redu, Gaiuse?
Ništa. Ništa. Pretpostavljam da
sam samo,oh...izgubio interes.
Za mnom?
Ne, ne za tobom,za...za ovim. Za ovim
mjestom,za...mislim da mi više ne nedostaje, stvarno.
Znaš što mi nedostaje? Sportovi.
Šališ se.
Ne. Običavala sam ići na piramidni teren tik prije
utakmice. Uzeti dvije karte. Ako bih dobro tempirala,
sjela bih taman na zvuk sirene.
Zavalila se...pustila energiju mase
da me preplavi. Val za valom
emocija, poput električne struje.
Zašto bi uzimala dvije karte?
Jedna za mene, i jedna za tebe. Znam da
je za tebe piramida previše dosadna,no
uvijek sam voljela
zamišlajti da si uz mene.
Pa, natjerao si to da jede. Pretpostavljam da je to
napredak. Možeš li natjerati to da se prevrne...moli?
Vidi možeš li saznati nešto o ovima.
Znaš, ova stvar bi sjedila u našoj menzi
i jela našu hranu i slušala naše priče.
Nisi li? Samo sjedila tamo...Slušala nas,
pretvarala se da si nam prijatelj, nisi li?
Admirale, molim vas! Svaki...fizički kontakt sa
subjektom će vratiti sve moje napore nazad na početak.
Saznaj sve o ovome brodu.
Želim umrijeti. Hoćeš mi pomoći
da umrem? Hoćeš li me ubiti?
Još se navikavam sa stvari ovdje.
No prilično sam siguran da nam sve ptice
mogu biti u zraku na vrijeme za taj napad.
Sigurno. Hoću reći, hm, da, gdine.
Hvala vam, šefe.
Cally. Laird nije vojnik, zar ne?
Ne, gdine. On je civilni aeronautički
inžinjer sa broda zvanog Scila...
Civil? Znaš li kako je došao na Pegaza?
Glasina je da je Pegaz imao i civilnu
flotu, poput nas, i da joj se nešto dogodilo.
Hvala ti.
Lairdov brod je bila Scila.
Scila je bila...civilno transporter. Pronašli smo
nju i par drugih civilnih brodova tjedan nakon napada.
Bili su dobri brodovi. FTL pogon, neki čak i naoružani.
Mnogo potencijalnih rezervnih dijelova za Pegaza.
I tako....Admiral je donijela
odluku. Vojne potrebe se prioritetne.
Ogoljeli ste ih. Ogoljeli ste ih
zbog dijelova? Sveta majko Artemidina.
Koliko ste opreme uzeli? Uzeli ste im pogone
za skok? Ostavili sve te ljude tako tamo?
Ne, ne sve. Admiral Cain je
pregledala popise putnika i odlučila
tko je vrijedan a tko nije.
Scila je bila
najteža. Laird i 15 drugih, muškaraca i žena,
svi su putovali sa svojim obiteljima, ženama,
muževima, djecom. Odabrani...odbili su poći.
Došlo je do otpora. Pa je došla zapovijed da
pobijemo obitelj svakome tko odbije poći. Pa jesmo.
Dvije obitelji, postrojili
smo ih uza zid. I upucali.
CAGov posao nikad ne završava.
Haj...kako si?
Misliš osim što sam degradiran? Što
radim za jednog od svojih pilota?
Divno, nikad bolje.
Znaš da nisam imala ništa s tim?
Nikad nisam ni mislio.
Baš sam bio
do Heloa i Tyrona. Jedva se drže.
Dobro. Pomozi mi isplanirati ovu
operaciju. Buljim u ova imena.
Samo ćeš nastaviti? Kao
da se ništa nije dogodilo?
Lee, ona zapovijeda, što želiš
da napravim? Ništa ne možemo.
Mislio sam da bi voljela čistu odjeću.
Jesi li bila svjesna da si
cylonac kad si se ukrcala na brod?
Ili bi se opisala kao agenta spavača?
Znala sam što sam. Ja sam bila
vojnik. Imala sam misiju i izvršila je.
Mislila sam da kad budem gotova
da ću umrijeti. Da ćete me ubiti.
Onda bih dobila novo tijelo...bila ponovo rođena.
Ali me niste ubili. Stvari koje ste mi učinili..
Što su ti učinili bile su zle. No ja
nisam jedan od njih. Moraš mi vjerovati.
Za tebe se stvari popravljaju.
Od ovog trena. Obećavam.
Ne želim da se stvari
poprave. Želim umrijeti.
No znaš da ne možeš
umrijeti. Znaš to, zar ne?
Tvoja svijest će se samo prenijeti
i probudit ćeš se u drugom tijelu.
Ne ako uništite to.
Što, taj brod? Reci mi. Što
je tako važno kod toga broda?
Cylonci to zovu Uskrsnim
brodom. Trenutno smo predaleko
od cylonskog doma za normalni proces
downloada, i zato su izgradili ovaj brod.
U njemu su svi strojevi
potrebni za uskrsavanje cylonaca.
Ovaj brod leti sa flotom, za
Galacticom, već nekoliko mjeseci.
Znači to im je bekap? Mjesto
na koje odlaze kad umru.
I što ako izgube svoj bekap?
Onda će svaki cylonac koji ovdje umre
biti mrtav. Stvarno mrtav.
Mislim da im se to ne bi svidjelo.
Ne, gdjo. Možda nas čak
i prestanu proganjati.
Zašto riskirati da te ubiju kad
se nećeš probuditi u novom tijelu?
Doktore, mislim da ste identificirali
najvažniji brod u galaksiji.
Imam dobrih i loših dana. No
ne boj se, neću danas umrijeti.
Oprosti.
Što mogu učiniti za tebe?
Bila si u pravu glede Cainke. Pegaz
je pratilo 15 civilnih brodova.
Cainka ih je ogoljela. Skinula
im dijelove, zalihe...ljude.
Voljela bih reći da sam iznenađena, no ona
je takva. Igra na pobjedu, i ti moraš isto.
Što ti se dogodilo?
MMmm?
Postala si tako krvožedna.
Znam da dok je Cain živa...tvoje
preživljavanje je upitno, to znam.
Što ti mogu donijeti?
Novo tijelo. Možda jednu od onih
mladih jedrih cylonka sa uskrsnog broda.
Ne mogu te zamisliti kao plavušu.
Iznenadio bi se.
Vidimo se sutra?
Zapovjedniče. Ona neće oklijevati
da te ubije. Nemoj joj to dopustiti.
Znaš, kad izađemo
odavde...napravit ću neke promjene.
Da? Kakve?
Ja i Sharon. Gotovo je. Stvarno
mislim, gotovo, ja to ne mogu više.
Nemoj me krivo shvatiti, LT. To što smo
napravili, napravio bih opet, u trenu.
No moram sve to ostaviti.
Mislio sam da jesam.
Da...znam što misliš.
Ti?
Da, ja. Što? Misliš da je
ja ponekad ne premišljam?
Misliš da se ne pitam jesam li poludio.
Zaljubljen sam u ženu za koju znam da nije žena.
Dobit ću bebu koja je što? Pola stroj?
Stvarno je voliš, zar ne?
Da. Da,volim je. I ne mogu je
pustiti. No ako ti možeš...zaboravi je.
Naš primarni cilj je brod
kojeg cylonci nazivaju uskrsnim.
Čuvaju ga dvije bazne zvijezde
koje nas slijede kroz ovaj sektor.
Naš plan je, pojednostavljeno,
pustit ih da nas nađu.
Čekat ćemo ih u ovom sustavu
tu i pretvarat se da rudarimo.
Kad cylonci napadnu, Galactica
i većina civila će skočiti.
Manja grupa civila će ostati.
Cyloncima će izgledati da imaju problema sa FTL
pogonom i da pokušavaju pobjeći podsvjetlosnom brzinom.
Cylonci lovci će progoniti mamac,
odmičući se od baznih zvijezda.
Jednom kad ih mamac odvuče,
Galactica i Pegaz se vraćaju
i napadaju bazne zvijezde. Ja
uskačem u Crnoj ptici i uništavam
FTL pogon na uskrsnom brodu,
i tako ga sprječavam da skoči.
Zašto ne stavimo par nuklearnih
bombi i uništimo ga odmah?
Proveli smo par takvih simulacija. Utvrdili
smo da bi cylonci otkrili nuklearne bojne glave
i uništili sakriveni brod prije nego bi
ušao u domet. Kad FTLovi budu uništeni
Galactica i Pegaz će srediti bazne
zvijezde, a viperi će napasti uskrsni brod.
Koliko oderda?
Svi.
Ima li problema, zapovjedniče?
Trebam vremena da proučim detalje.
Kako hoćeš. Ja sam ih
proučila i zadovoljna sam.
Želim tvog CAGa ovdje, da mi
pomogne i odgovori na neka pitanja.
Jedan sat, Thrace.
Da, gdjo.
Sine, budi spreman.
Jack, želim da pošalješ
odred marinaca na Galacticu.
Želim da ih sam odabereš. Potpuno
pouzdani. Potpuno lojalni. Oštri.
Imam zadatak za tebe, Kara.
Sve za vas, znate to.
Ne prihvaćaj prebrzo. Ovo ti se neće svidjeti. Ni
meni se ne sviđa. No odlučio sam da mora biti učinjeno.
I tebe premještam na Galacticu. Reći ću
Adami da ćeš biti moje oči i uši tamo.
Mrzit će to. Mislit će da si moj špijun i pokušat
će te izbaciti iz donošenja odluka. No prihvatit će.
Želim da budeš tamo tijekom
napada. Budi uz Adamu.
Nakon završetka napada i kad
okupiš svoje pilote želim da sletiš
na Pegaza i javiš se odmah u CIC. Lee
će ići sa tobom. On će ti čuvati leđa.
Postavi marince duž broda i
drži jedan odred ispred CICa.
Nakon napada biti će urnebes.
Udarat će se po leđima,
čestitati pobjedu.
Neće biti na oprezu.
Osiguranje će biti nikakvo.
Nazvat ću te radiom.
Nazvat ću te, i kad ti dam
zapovjed "izvrši narančasti kod"
Kad me čuješ da kažem "konačni pad"
Javit ćeš marincima da terminiraju
Adamino zapovjedništvo. Počevši sa Adamom.
Želim da uzmeš svoj pištolj...
i upucaš Admirala Cain u glavu.

<i>Previously, on Battlestar Galactica</i>
I'm promoting you to Captain.
I'm making you commander
of the Pegasus Air Group.
You're promoting me ?
I need a CAG with guts.
We are the leaders of this fleet.
As such, we need to set an example.
Oh, let's just cut through
the handholding, shall we ?
Two of his men murdered one of my officers,
while protecting a Cylon.
They're guilty, they admitted it.
And under regulations,
I have complete authority
to try, convict, and sentence them.
And you and I both know that the
penalty for that crime is death.
I'm afraid there is only one end to this.
We've got to kill her.
Well, I see that you got it to eat.
That's progress, I suppose.
Can you get it to roll over... beg ?
Admiral, please !
I thought you might like
a fresh set of clothes.
You know what I miss ?
Sports.
I used to go the pyramid court
just before game time.
Scalp two tickets.
One for me, and one for you.
I always liked to feel
that you were there with me.
The Cylons call this
their Resurrection ship.
At the moment, we are too far away
from the cylon home world
for the normal downloading process to work,
which is why they built this ship.
It contains the entire apparatus
necessary for Cylon resurrection.
Then any Cylon who dies out here...
Would be dead.
As in, really dead.
Our primary objective is a
Cylon vessel called Resurrection
Our plan is to jump in
in the Blackbird stealth fighter
and take out the FTL drives
on the Resurrection ship,
preventing it from jumping away.
When the FTL is destroyed,
our attack squadrons will go
after the resurrection ship itself.
How many squadrons ?
All of'em.
Jack, I want to transfer a detachment
of marines to Galactica.
I have a mission for you, Kara.
Anything for you, you know that.
Position marines in key areas
throughout the ship...
I will ask for you over the wireless.
I will call you directly, and
when I have you on the line
and you hear me give
the command "execute case orange"
You are to terminate Adama's command.
Started with Adama.
I want you to pull out your weapon
and shoot Admiral Cain in the head.
48 HOURS EARLIER
This is a fracked-up thing
that I've been asked to do.
But we kill people for a living.
They say shoot, we shoot.
So you're gonna do this ?
Yeah, I'm gonna do it.
Kara.
I could use some backup.
I'll understand if you can't.
You know better than that.
Yeah, I guess so.
People have to have this, Kara.
Trust.
Your word
and my word.
We don't have this, then...
we really are no different than the Cylons.
Thank you.
Oh, looky here.
Sunshine boys are here.
You know, the man you killed saved
my life and the lives of 50 other men,
you miserable frack.
You,
You call me "sir".
Yes, sir.
So I guess you were both getting your poles
greased by that filthy little robot girl ?
I'm sorry. I don't think
I quite heard that right.
The glass. I can't hear you.
So, why don't you open the door, come in,
and we'll talk about it in here.
That's a great idea, Chief.
They really want to do things.
Hands over your head.
- Hey, hey, hey, slow down !
- On your knees, on your fracking knees !
Slow it down, slow it down
Just think about what you're doing here.
Just think about what we're doing here, guys.
What the frack is this ?
Don't worry, sir.
We'll take it real slow, Sir !

See, the gut,
that's a vulnerable area.
Lieutenant Thorne told me that, once.
He said if you really want to do some
damage without leaving a mark,
go for the gut.
You'd be surprised what you can do
with the simplest things.
Bar of soap,
plain old towel.
How bad could it be, right ?
You'd be surprised.
Cowards.
Cowards ?
Is that what you said ?
Now give me that.
You know what, I lied.
I'm not going slow anymore.
Attention on deck !
Gage, Vireem !
Out of the cell, standing tall.
Right here !
Remove the restraints from the prisoners.
Specialist Gage, let me ask you something.
Those men in there,
are they wearing colonial uniforms ?
Yes, sir.
Specialist Vireem, do you agree
with Specialist Gage here
that those are, in fact, colonial officers ?
Yes, sir.
- They killed lieutenant--
- Shut your frackin'mouth !
You see, I don't quite understand
what I just saw
because I think I saw you two
knuckledraggers
treating those men like they were cylons,
which of course, couldn't be right because,
if in fact, that was the case,
then you're both subject to
charges of assaulting a chief
and a lieutenant under color
of authority in a time of war, which if
I'm not mistaken,
carries a penalty on this ship
that is quite severe.
Now, get the hell out of here.
- Sir.
- Sir.
Get out.
Yes, sir.
Sir.
Thank you.
Thank you, Colonel.
I don't want your thanks.
I owe Lieutenant Thorne my life,
as do many people on this ship.
He was trying to rape a prisoner.
You can't rape a machine, Lieutenant.
- You drink, Thrace ?
- Only to excess, sir.
Only to excess ?
Learn that from Colonel Tigh, did you ?
Not exactly.
I understand you belted him once.
Yeah...
That was something that I did
without really thinking.
Don't apologize.
Some people get exactly
what they deserve.
From what I read about your XO,
maybe he needs to get popped
in the mouth every once in while, hmm ?
I know you're very close with Adama.
Yes, sir.
And I know he's a good man.
And I know he's had to make some very hard
choices over the last few months.
Lord knows I have.
Then maybe you can understand why he did
what he thought he had to do
when you said you were going
to execute Helo and Tyrol.
Let me tell you something.
I've had to watch a lot of kids
be put into body bags.
They're covered with flags
and they float out that airlock.
You think I don't understand
his feelings towards his men ?
Sometimes terrible things have to be done.
Inevitably,
each and every one of us
will have to face a moment
where we have to commit that horrible sin.
And if we flinch in that moment,
if we hesitate for one second,
if we let our conscience get in the way,
you know what happens ?
There are more kids in those body bags.
More kids floating out that airlock.
I don't know why...
but I have a lot of faith in you.
And I want you to promise me
that when that moment comes
you won't flinch.
Do not flinch.
Come in.
Courier run from Pegasus, sir.
They got you doing courier runs now ?
Well, I...
I volunteered for this one.
Kara told me about her...
her mission.
Come to change my mind ?
Just wanted to hear it from you.
Decision's been made.
Assassination.
That's your decision.
That's how you resolve your differences
with your superior officers.
If you're gonna have some problem
backing up Starbuck,
I can find somebody else.
It's not about me watching her back.
I'm not going to debate this with you.
This was a very hard decision.
But I think the President's right.
This is the best way to
safeguard the fleet.
The president ?
- So you and the president...
- Yes.
She's made of sterner stuff
than people give her credit for.
Is this all I have to sign ?
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Lieutenant.
It's good to see you.
<i>Attention Pegasus.</i>
<i>Jump prep underway.</i>
<i>Viper pilots report to ready room
in five minutes.</i>
<i>Decoy squadrons, check in with CIC.</i>
<i>Fire control,

<i>Upon jump completion,

Let's go.
<i>All resurrection strike squadrons,</i>

<i>Make ship ready for combat jump.</i>
<i>Set condition one throughout the ship.</i>
- Good hunting, Captain.
- You too, Colonel.
Sorry about this, Saul, but
the Admiral didn't feel
comfortable with our marines
under your command.
Yeah. Sorry about a lot of things.
Be sure your marines
and our marines are aware
of their areas of responsibility
if we're boarded by the cylons.
The last thing we need is
Colonials shooting at each other.
Amen to that.
Wait outside.
Yes sir.
Sit down.
I've asked you here to find out why
the Cylons hate us so much.
I'm not sure I know
how to answer that.
I mean, hate might
not be the right word.
I don't want
to fence with you.
I just want to know why.
It's what you said
at the ceremony
before the attack
when Galactica
was being decommissioned.
You gave a speech
that sounded like
it wasn't the one you prepared.
You said
that humanity was
a flawed creation.
And that people still
kill one another
for petty jealousy and greed.
You said that humanity never asked itself
why it deserved to survive.
Maybe you don't.
Resurrection ships firing
up their FTL drives.
They're getting ready to jump.
Don't anyone look out of the window
right now, please.
Starbuck, Apollo.
Target's FTL is history.
She's all yours.
<i>Roger that, Apollo xxx</i>
Sir, I just received
an emergency transponder from the Blackbird.
It's the auto-distress beacon.
Alert the search and rescue Raptor.
See if he had time to eject.
Attention on Pegasus.
Prepare to launch attack squadrons.
Copy to Galactica.
Aye, sir.
<i>Attention on Galactica.
Prepare to launch attack squadrons.</i>
<i>Starbuck, Pegasus.
Resurrection Ship Twelve low at fifteen.</i>
Watch your intervals.
Take your posts.
<i>Engaging cylon Raiders</i>
<i>Fleece look down I got'em.</i>
<i>Nice work. Zero, one.</i>
<i>- Hang on ! Take a shot !
- Fraking toasters !</i>
<i>Cover me I can't shake him.</i>
- Mr. Gaeta.
- Sir ?
Order batteries Alpha through Echo
to switch to salvo fire.
<i>Set secondary battery.</i>
<i>Full attack mode. Fire at will.</i>
Tens of thousands of cylons
are about to die.
Tens of thousands, Gaius.
God will not forgive this sin.
Do you think god will forgive us ?
God forgives all.
Don't listen to her.
You think she can help you ?
You think that that broken woman can
offer you even a fraction of what I can ?
I know god's plan for you.
I know how to help you fulfill your destiny.
Do you know what I miss most ?
You're going to laugh when I tell you this.
Sports.
Don't do this.
Yeah, that's right.
I used to love getting to
the pyramid game just before tip-off.
By timing it right,
I could sit down right at the horn
and then let the emotion of the crowd
flood over me.
Waves and waves of it.
Like electric current.
That's beautiful.
And I always had two tickets.
No.
One for me,
Please.
and one for you.
Apollo, Galactica,
do you read ?
Apollo, Galactica,
do you read ?
Can you say your position ?
<i>Apollo, Galactica,
do you read ?</i>
<i>Can you say your position ?</i>
<i>Apollo, Galactica,
do you read ?</i>
Apollo, Galactica,
do you read ?
Can you say your position ?
<i>Apollo, Galactica, are you reading this ?</i>
<i>Are you out there ?</i>
<i>Apollo, Galactica, do you read ?</i>
<i>Can you say your position ?</i>
<i>Apollo, Galactica, do you read ?</i>
<i>Apollo, Galactica, are you reading this ?</i>
Are you out there ?
I'm sorry Kara.
Captain Thrace is reporting
massive detonations.
The resurrection ship has been destroyed.
Yes !
They've done it.
Clear.
<i>He's all right.</i>
<i>He's a little shaken. But, I say again,</i>
<i>Apollo is all right.</i>
All the remaining cylons have jumped way.
It's over, sir.
Congratulations, gentlemen.
I'm ready to die.
Send my soul to God.
Please.
I wish you were here, Lee.
Oh, what the hell.
I am so very proud of you.
Secure for condition one.
Set condition two throughout the ship.
Division officers, submit casualty
and damage report to combat.
- Glad we didn't need your marines today.
- Yeah.
Yeah, me too.
Signal from the flagship, sir.
Admiral Cain on the line.
Put her through.
Congratulations, Commander.
Congratulations to you too, Admiral.
A significant victory.
Is starbuck with you ?
Yes, she is.
This is starbuck.
<i>I've been thinking about what
we talked about before.</i>
It's not enough to survive.
One has to be worthy of surviving.
That's all.
I think that's very wise, sir.
Thank you.
Commander, I wonder if my XO
is standing close by.
Yes, he is.
<i>Yes, sir ?</i>
Congratulations, Jack.
Thank you, sir.
That's all.
Yes, sir.
You look like you could use a drink.
Thank you.
Oh, by the way, there was something
i wanted to tell you.
Last night, I was walking down
this corridor here when I saw--
No ! No, no.
I can't--I can't do this.
Suicide is a sin.
But I need to die.
What you need...
... is justice.
I know a place where you can stay,
where you will be safe.
Where I can look after you.
Why ?
Why would you do that ?
Because I love you.
Tell me, Admiral...
Can you roll over ?
Beg ?
Frack you.
You're not my type.
And she died knowing that her ship
and her crew were safe
and that her mission
had been accomplished.
Nothing was more important to her
than her ship,
her crew, and her mission.
And as I take command of Pegasus
I pledge to uphold those values
that made her such an effective
and heroic leader.
I only knew Admiral Cain
for a short time,
so what I have to say about her
will be short.
She faced things.
She looked them right in the eye
and she didn't flinch.
That's something that we do a lot
around here.
We second-guess.
We worry.
When I think about what she went through
after the attack...
all alone,
one ship, no help,
no hope...
She didn't give up.
She didn't worry.
She didn't second-guess.
She acted.
She did what she thought
needed to be done,
and the Pegasus survived.
Might be hard to admit,
or hard to hear,
but I think that we were safer
with her...
than we are without.
Lee.
Lee, you okay ?
Are you okay ?
No, not really.
I...
I broke my word to you.
- What are you talking about ?
- I let you down.
I wasn't there when you needed me.
Look...
A close call like that...
that would mess with anybody's head.
All right ?
It turns out I didn't need you anyway.
So...
Let's just be glad that we both
came back alive, all right ?
That's just it, Kara.
I didn't want to make it back alive.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
Same here.
So...
Where do we go from here ?
So, how did the cylon
manage to get off the Pegasus
undetected ?
No one really knows.
There was so much chaos
in the aftermath of the attack.
Thank the Gods that you did not
have to do what I advised.
That makes me very happy.
Yes, thank the Gods.
How are you feeling ?
I could sleep for about a year.
But you, however,
do not have that luxury
because you have a new job.
Billy.
It took a little while
to find that jeweler.
Thank you.
Rumor has it
that I know very little
about military protocol
but I do believe
that...
someone who commands
more than one ship
is called an admiral.
Congratulations, Admiral Adama.
Thank you, Madame President.
Thank you, Billy.
I never gave up hope, I just
stopped trying to get these
a long time ago.
Just goes to show you, Bill.
Never give up hope.
Same goes for you, Laura.
Right.
I'm afraid the tests are positive.
The mass is malignant. It's advanced
well beyond the left breast.
I'm afraid the test is positive.
Ms. Roslin... the surgery,
of course, to remove the mass...
Secretary Roslin?
Yes?
Naylin Stans from the education
alliance. You said you wanted to talk?
Yes. I'm sorry, Mr. Stans...
I have to admit, I was
surprised to get your message.
The President was surprised I sent it.
Once our chief negotiator
got a billy-club to the head,
we figured Adar's government
had written us off as a lost cause.
I was a teacher long before
 I was secretary of education,
and causes are only lost when we give up.
Madame President?
Can you hear me?
Let's make her as
comfortable as we can.
Oh, gods...
Starbuck zero four niner- cap is away.
Galactica, roger that.
Zero four niner. Safe flight.
Safe and 20 frakkin' minutes late.
Did you have a rough night, starbuck?
You're way out of line.
Just follow my lead and save
 the attitude for someone who cares.
Kat six seven zero- roger that.
Request permission to clear guns.
Roger that, Kat.
Clear your throat.
Damn it!
Weapons malfunction! Weapons
malfunction! Galactica!
Kat, you good?
I'm good, I'm good. What
the hell just happened?
Your wing gun's out.
Just keep it steady, we're going home.
Galactica, this is Starbuck.
I'm declaring an emergency.
We've got two bent birds.
Requesting priority clearance to land.
Starbuck, Galactica. Flight deck is yours.
Why don't you just shoot
us in the locker room, chief?
Save the wear and tear on the ships.
Kat's guns are clean,
 I checked 'em myself.
Yeah, well I don't
believe in accidents.
Chief. Something's not right.
The weight's off, it's too light.
I found three more just like it.
Mixed in with the regular rounds.
Casing's been weakened.
Falls apart in the barrel.
Next one hits it- bang, she's lucky
she didn't lose her whole wing.
One bad round's a fluke.
More than one, sabotage.
Pull 'em all!
Alright you heard the
 chief, lets pull 'em all! Go!
How's the President doing, Doc?
She's dying... and she knows it.
I offered her a shot of morpha to ease
the pain, but... she wouldn't hear of it.
Tests are positive.
Mr. President... the terrorists...
Mr. President, we should at least speak
with the strikers before sending in the troops.
They're teachers, not terrorists.
They're acting like thugs.
They're last demonstration
put two policemen in the hospital.
Six of them have chained themselves
outside the hall of education.
As far as I'm concerned,
 they're criminals.
Their pay is substandard,
 their schools are falling apart,
and the strike action has been gaining
momentum for months, and you know that.
I don't understand why we're
not at least talking to them.
One of the most interesting
 things about being president
is that you don't have to
 explain yourself...to anyone.
You've already set a meeting
with Stans, haven't you?
Obviously, only if you
approve, Mr. President.
She's really not in a
fit state to do anything...
let alone conduct
any government business.
Don't talk about
me as if I'm not here.
There'll be plenty of
time for that soon enough.
Billy, could you-
Gentlemen, I called you
 here to discuss the Cylon.
Dr. Cottle... would you please tell
 them what you told me this morning?
I'm no expert in genetics,
but I can read a blood test.
That Cylon fetus is showing some
very peculiar genetic abnormalities.
I haven't seen any of
this on your report, Doctor.
No, um. Well, as Dr. Cottle says,
he's- he's not an expert, and I am.
Um, I've been through
 the tests and I-I
wouldn't say that there
 was anything conclusive.
Didn't say conclusive,
just damned odd.
Right. Madame President.
As you know, the Sharon Cylon
is of considerable tactical
value to the fleet.
Perhaps you've gotten too
 close to your subject, Doctor.
This is difficult, so I'm
 going to cut right to it.
Allowing this thing to be born
could have frightening consequences.
For the security of this fleet,
 I believe the Cylon pregnancy
must be terminated before it is too late.
Madame President, I'd like-
I thought you of all people
would understand, Admiral.
Madame President. I don't
understand, this makes no sense.
One of the interesting things
about being president is
you don't have to
explain yourself to anyone.
Thank you, gentlemen,
I'm-I'm a little tired.
Gentlemen.
I don't want to seem alarmist,
um, but I am perturbed.
I think that the, uh, the President's
 illness is affecting her judgment.
Especially when it
comes to the subject-
She seemed reasonably
coherent to me.
Well, then I'll have to appeal
 to you on scientific grounds.
Destroying this child would seriously
 impact my studies of the Cylon sub-species.
The President made the
 call and I'm backing her.
Look, with all due respect,
 the President made the call
based on evidence presented
by Dr. Cottle, and he's medicine's-
Pull yourself together.
You're about to become
President of the colonies.
You're going to be asked to
make some very hard decisions.
Act like you can handle it.
Gods- uh...
where have you been?
Where have I been?
I never left you, Gaius.
Oh, right, yeah, um.
Yeah, metaphorically speaking.
It's just that it was
weeks ago, and I, uh...
I'm sure you've suffered
mightily in my absence.
You know, jealousy
 is a really ugly emotion.
What is this lingering controversy
over my affair with your
 three-dimensional duplicate.
I'm not jealous, I'm concerned.
Oh yeah, concerned, about what?
Our child!
Oh-now you're concerned?
Well, for your information,
 the President wants to kill it.
Once Roslin's gone,
you'll be President.
You can use your new
authority to save our child.
Oh, like that's gonna- did you
see the way Adama looked at me?
The contempt on his face?
I will be the President, all right,
but without the military support,
 I might as well be an anointed dog catcher.
Yes, well, you have your
own resources if you'd use them.
What, you don't
know what I mean?
No, I don't know what you mean.
The nuclear device.
The one Adama provided
 for your research.
There is one way.
I didn't want to have
to ask you for this.
I didn't want to
have to ask you for this.
But what I really need-
But what I really need
To complete the project...
- is a nuclear warhead.
Is a nuclear- warhead.
You're totally insane.
I'm trying to help you, you idiot.
If Adama remains committed
to the destruction of our child,
it may be our only hope.
There's no easy way to say this.
It's about the Cylon.
The President has decided that
her pregnancy will be terminated.
What? Why?
Doc Cottle discovered some
anomalies in the fetal blood work.
Isn't that expected?
Maybe.
But the President believes that
 to allow the baby to come to full term
constitutes an
unacceptable risk to the fleet.
I don't understand.
Sharon's only helped us
since she came back from Caprica.
She even turned on her own.
To save her life.
Don't mistake the will the live
for genuine compassion,
Lieutenant.
She's still the enemy.
Does she know?
Not yet.
Then I should be
the one to tell her.
If that's all, sir.
Helo. I don't expect you
 to agree to the decision.
But I need you to accept it.
We're talking about my child, sir.
Part of me.
But I guess it's easier
to kill when you call it a Cylon.
Dismissed.
So you're saying someone's been
 tampering with our ammunition.
Shells don't unload themselves.
What's this I hear
 about you ordering
both Galactica and Pegasus
 fighters to stand down?
Price you pay for
reinstating me as CAG, sir.
Maybe that was a mistake.
Maybe I don't give a
damn what you think, sir.
Take it easy, both of you.
Fact is, we've been sharing
 stories between the ships.
And nobody flies combat until
our ammo supplies check out.
Leaving us defenseless if
 the Cylons decide to pick a fight.
We were defenseless before
 this, we just didn't know about it.
Lee, find out who did this.
All right. Excuse me,
I'm looking for Asha Janik.
Asha, she's over there.
Let's do this quietly.
Asha Janik?
-Captain Adama.
I have a message
 for your father.
They may take me!
Okay, stop her!
But I am one of many!
We have declared war against
 Galactica's armies of death!
The Cylons aren't
our true enemy!
It's the military
that refuses to negotiate!
All we want is peace!
Demand peace! Demand peace!
So much for being discreet, huh?
We found these pamphlets
 in Janik's quarters.
Some kind of a manifesto.
"Demand peace from the Cylons?"
Who the hell are these people?
Cylon sympathizers.
Just had no idea they
were this organized.
I want to know how
she got aboard my ship.
The hangar deck's short-staffed.
We've been forced to import
civilians to handle some of the grunt work.
Apparently she's, um, she's a Picon,
 worked maintenance on the Greenleaf,
no known criminal affiliations.
 Huh, until now, now listen to this:
"Do not be afraid, we are not terrorists,
but we will not sit back
while Adama's war machine
continues to press us
into cruel and futile conflict."
"Our demonstrations worked.
News is already spreading
across the fleet."
I know. We were
contacted by a person
claiming to speak
 for the subversives
demanding a meeting
on the Galactica.
They've got stones,
 I'll give them that.
Well, I've agreed.
What?
We're not negotiating.
I just want to know
what we're up against.
Madame secretary?
Considering the stakes, you don't
seem particularly engaged.
The stakes are what we
decide to make them, Mr. Stans.
If the President uses troops
 to enforce us back to work order,
people will get hurt. Even die.
Some causes are worth dying for.
Not this one.
The mass is malignant.
Doctor.
Admiral, I am Royan Jahee.
You have a unique way of
welcoming visitors to your ship.
Visitor, my ass. We shoot
 people like you for treason.
Colonel, I'm only an interested
 party trying to prevent more bloodshed.
I deplore what happened
aboard your vipers.
How many sympathizers do
we have aboard this fleet?
If you're trying to crush an
 organization, you can stop now.
The people in this movement
 are following an idea, not a leader.
What the hell do they want?
Peace... with the Cylon.
You want us to surrender?
They attacked us.
Only after we'd enslaved them!
You call yourselves
military men, strategists.
Explain to me how our current course
 of attack and retreat leads to victory?
You can play innocent bystander, but I
 think you know more than you're telling us.
Either way, you're
a danger to this fleet.
Admiral, arresting me isn't
 going to stop any of this.
Maybe not. But it's
a start. Take him away.
All right, get your rubber gloves on.
This is everything from
 the Janik woman's quarters.
Somehow the Admiral thinks
 looking through this crap's
gonna tell us something new
about their so-called movement.
So, um... haven't seen much
of you since your space walk.
Hold it, what is this?
What's a deckhand need with
a portable library reader?
The Daru Mozu. A tylium refinery.
And Janik's used to explosives.
This is the CAG. Get me a
 tak team ready, right now.
I don't understand, why
 are they doing this now?
I don't know.
The Admiral said they found
something in the baby's blood.
Somehow, President Roslin
considers it a threat to the fleet.
It can't just be that.
I've done nothing but help
 them since I've come here.
I've held back my anger.
I've tried to show them
that Cylons are not all the same.
That we're not all murderers.
Deep down, I think
 they're still afraid of you.
Yeah... afraid.
They wanna be afraid of something?
Yeah? Just let them come!
Let 'em! Let them
 try to take my baby!
Just let them try to take my baby!
Sharon, stop!
Sharon, please
don't do this! Please!
Listen to me, listen
 to me! Listen to me.
When we land, move fast.
We're looking for explosive devices
 set near the Daru's FTL drive.
Captain, I'm getting
something on the wireless.
I think it's coming
 from the Daru Mozu.
None of us want to die,
but the fighting must end.
If my sacrifice sends a signal
to the Cylon that brings peace,
then it was worth it.
I do this for my children,
and for the children that will follow them.
Gods willing, demand
 peace, demand peace.
Pull out, pull out!
Pull out, pull out, pull out!
People are dead.
I grieve for them, Admiral.
And I assure you, the tylium's
ship's just a taste of what's in store,
unless someone starts listening!
You listen and you listen well.
I don't care if I have to interrogate
every civilian on board this fleet.
This is gonna stop.
Do you understand?
 Yes.
Mr. Vice President, President
Roslin insisted on your taking the tour.
She'd like the transition to
 go as smoothly as possible.
What are these?
Cylon agent suspects, sir.
That number means
everything to her.
Represents hope, that's our future.
Yes, yes.
Being the President is,
uh, a lot of responsibility.
It's tradition for outgoing Presidents
 to leave a letter for their successor.
It's usually opened on
the first day of the new term,
but the next few days are
 liable to prove... hectic, so...
Well, let's just pray
 that she gets better.
Let's.
Excuse me.
Mr. Vice President?
Hello?
Yes. Yes.
I understand. Thank you.
I was told I might
meet an old friend here.
It's good to see you, Gaius.
So you've become a member
of the peace movement?
Well, despite what you may think,
I've always abhorred violence.
Would you excuse us? Please.
Do they have any
 idea what you are?
Of course not, even
 their dedication has limits.
I miss you.
You look amazing.
I can't believe-
how real you are.
What're you doing?
I haven't stopped thinking about you
 since the second I left the Pegasus.
No, no-
I can't get you out of my head.
Don't-do this, not yet.
I can't help myself, I can't.
I'm sorry.
No, I'm- I'm sorry.
 I'm just-I'm not ready.
So, is there any reason in
particular for inviting me around here?
Because you saved
me. Let me save you.
Oh, here we go again.
 What are you talking about?
You must sense it. Gaius,
the fleet's crumbling.
People are turning on each other. There
are serious misgivings about the military.
When you're President, you can use
the office to turn them against Adama,
paving the way
 for the Cylons to save us.
I-I would love to be
 with you always, but-
I know it's hard, but it's the only way.
No. No.
I am not who you think I am.
And I will not be responsible
 for the destruction of mankind.
If you would have caught it sooner,
maybe we could have done more.
Laura, come in.
I didn't like the way
we left things this morning.
Richard, I-
I know. You've been thinking
 this is a mistake for a while now.
I just met with Stans.
The education alliance
 is going to back off.
Back off?
Laura, what did you give them?
I made them a promise that we would
seriously hear out their grievances, Richard.
I thought you'd be happy
they're going back to work.
Laura, you've put me
 in a very awkward position.
I don't see how.
Both sides gave ground.
It's not just about your teachers.
It's the next strike I'm worried about.
You just showed them that if they hold
out long enough, this administration will cave.
You expected me to fail.
I expected you to hold the line.
This doesn't have to
be the end of the world.
You can stay on in
an advisory capacity.
Gods know we need your ideas.
You're asking me to resign?
I don't have any choice.
This isn't about you
and me anymore.
You're right, it's not.
You were willing to attack those
people and up until a few hours ago,
I was prepared to let you.
I am on my way to the Galactica
to represent this administration.
When I return, if you still
want my job, be prepared to fight.
When I return...
Notify the Admiral.
This is Admiral Adama.
As you know, President Roslin has
been aboard Galactica for the last few days.
She's a fighter. But as of
this moment, her prognosis is grave.
I know that many of you
believe in the power of prayer.
If that is your way, then I urge
 you to pray for our President.
As for the others,
 I hope you will join me
in keeping her in our thoughts.
Admiral, please don't do this.
Stand down, everyone.
Give me room.
Think about what you're
doing Helo. You're a soldier.
I'm a father, like you.
Please, sir... give me a raptor,
let me take her off the ship.
 I'll get her away from the fleet.
I can't do that, son.
Admiral, Admiral!
Doctor, get the hell outta here.
Admiral, I must talk to
you concerning the Cylon child.
It seems I may have been... wrong.
Very wrong.
When I said that Dr. Cottle
misinterpreted the fetal blood work-
See, I had another look at those samples
and I discovered something quite intriguing.
Understand, Cylon blood is virtually
 impossible to differentiate from our own.
That being said, obviously it has to be slightly
different because the Cylon is not human,
If our blood looks like this...
for example.
And the Cylon's blood looks like this...
then it's fair to assume that the
 Cylon human is carrying an amalgam.
Is this a theory or fact?
The Cylon's fetus contains no antigens.
It has no blood type. That's
what Dr. Cottle was talking about
when he said it was damned odd.
Except it's not damned odd, it's astonishing.
Now, knowing as we do that the Cylons are built
 slightly better to endure than their human counterparts,
I wonder could the
Cylon blood also be blessed,
shall we say blessed, with a
heightened resistance to disease?
Huh...so. I applied a
sample of Sharon's fetal blood
to some cancer cells
 I took from the President.
What am I looking at?
Nothing. That's the whole point.
The cancer was gone and it was
 gone within a matter of hours.
Are you saying you found a
cure for the President's cancer?
Well, it's untried.
It-it's obviously untried and
therefore extremely dangerous.
But, yes, it's possible.
If you abort Sharon's fetus
now, you'll never know.
Now you may feel a sharp pain.
Sharon, it's okay,
 it's gonna be all right.
I don't like what you're doing.
I think it's unnatural
 and damned dangerous.
Yes, well, given the
patient's current condition,
I am not sure that I
see the downside.
Maybe it's just her time.
Then for once... perhaps I am
 the beacon of hope around here.
If you want to settle this,
your people have to disengage.
No more civil disobedience,
no more acts of violence.
I want our students back in school.
Done.
I'm glad you called,
Madame secretary.
Me too.
I'm afraid the tests are positive.
The mass is malignant.
What's happening?
Nurse! Help me get her on her side.
Nurse, nurse!
No, hold it.
I'll be damned.
Madame President?
Dr. Baltar?
It's so very good to see you.
No, no, don't-don't
 move. Don't move.
Madame President, very good.
How's she doing, doctor?
I've never seen anything like it.
It'll be a while before
she's a hundred percent, but...
her scans are clear.
Cancer's gone.
Are you sure?
It's gone.
Thank you.
Thank you. Admiral.
You seem better.
Much. Are you still holding the spokesman
 from the new faction in the brig?
Yes.
Would you take me to him, please?
Certainly.
Thank you.
I'll wait for you to get dressed.
President Roslin.
Mr. Yahee, isn't it?
I thought it was time we met.
Would you open the door, please?
Do it.
All these people want is to be heard.
A member of your group n
early destroyed our tylium refiner.
Before we can even begin to
talk I need your personal assurance
that there will be no more attacks.
As I told you the Admiral,
I have had no direct contact-
Genuine negotiations
require trust.
Do not lie to me.
I'll talk to my people.
Make them understand.
Excellent. And I'll listen...
maybe even act.
But if you renege, I'll insist the Admiral
hunt you and your friends down, without mercy.
You seem very content.
Sharon's child is safe.
Adama and Roslin have agreed
that more study is required
before any drastic
measures are taken.
Yes, but by saving Roslin, you've denied
yourself your rightful place of leadership.
There are many aspects of you,
Gaius, I will never understand.
You wouldn't.
Neither, would I suspect,
your corporeal counterpart.
Do you love her?
What is that?
The letter Roslin wrote me.
To be opened upon
 the event of her death.
"President Baltar. I offer my
sincere congratulations-" -Thank you.
 "I say that knowing
we've had our differences
and that you take office
despite my many reservations.
You may be the most
brilliant person I've ever met,
but your intelligence is
unleavened by compassion.
You must be reminded
of your ethical responsibilities
and challenged to rise
above your own selfish needs.
I don't write this to hurt you,
but to beg you to open your heart.
Understand that the people in the
 fleet look to you not just for leadership,
but for solace... justice.
Find a way to give them that,
and you will be a great
leader. Laura Roslin."
After all I've done for the fleet.
After all I've done for her.
Roslin's never trusted you.
She's undermined you
at every turn, and now-
So now we know she's
never gonna trust me.
This is not a political
struggle anymore, Gaius.
This is quite literally life and death.
The President assured me that as long
as there are no further acts of violence,
she's willing to bring our concerns
 to the quorum and Admiral Adama.
She's trying to buy time.
She'll never be open to
negotiating with the Cylons.
I disagree.
I think we've made real progress
 today, and so does the Vice President.
Baltar?
Yes. Just before I left,
e asked to meet with me.
He encouraged patience while
he works with Roslin from within.
And he offered the contents of
 this case as proof of his sincerity.
What's in it?
I don't know. He said that
you should be the one to open it.
Frak!
The Cylons Were
Created by Man
They Evolved
They Rebelled
There Are Many Copies
And They Have A Plan
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica...
Colonel Fisk is the
new Pegasus Commander
The cylon's fetus
contains no antigens.
??????????????????????
Are you saying you found a
cure for the President's cancer?
Yes.
I've got ships on half rations...
when will some of these supplies
start getting out to the fleet?
Target's FTL is history
She's all yours.
He's all right.
I say again, Apollo is all right.
Let's just be glad that we both
came back alive, all right?
That's just it, Kara.
I didn't want to
make it back alive.
You're not going to shoot.
You're not like me.
Cloud 9
48 hours earlier
Hey, hey. Hey, don't go.
Sorry.
I though you were still asleep.
You should have kicked me out
of bed an hour ago.
If I hold up Galactica's raptor,...
Tigh'll have my ass.
Which me both know currently
belongs to me.
All right, let's move on to
the the next item...
Oh, no, gentlemen. Please, don't get up.
After the last few weeks, it just
feels good to be on my feet,...
thank you though.
You've made a remarkable recovery,
Madame President.
Remarkable, indeed.
But, now I'm
playing catch-up,...
and I'm afraid during my illness I
lost focus. I let some things slide.
That's behind us now.
Yes, it is.
To the point...
supplies are running
low and the people are worried.
Well, they wouldn't be civilians...
if they didn't have
omething to bitch about.
Well, I think that in this case,
they're entitled.
Our inventory levels are tight,
but they're not critical.
But all the way across the fleet,...
people are reporting
shortages of essential goods...
and what they do get
comes at a high price.
They're turning to
the black market.
Last week, one of my aides...
came down with pneumonia.
Billy had to trade liquor...
to get the antibiotics.
It's the nature of the beast.
People want what they want.
A few trades would be one thing,
Commander Fisk, that's reality.
But, I'm talking about criminals...
making outrageous
demands on the people,...
so bottom line is, I'm implementing
a new fleet-wide trade policy.
We need to be in control
of our supply chain,...
not black market thugs.
I am hoping that I can have the
military's support on this.
Admiral. If you want Pegasus
to run these dogs down,...
you just give us the word.
Our people will do whatever it
takes to get this under control.
And it's good to have you back,
Madame President.
It's good to be back,
thank you, Admiral.
Gentlemen, thank you.
Is madame President always so
"right in your face"?
Her last-minute resurrection
seems to have...
invigorated her somewhat.
Yeah, well, maybe too much.
She doesn't really
think her made-up...
plans and regulations are going
to change anything, does she?
As if we don't
have enough to do.
No, madame President sets a
great prestige by her office...
and Adama supports her,
at least for the moment.
Well then, so do I,
just for the moment.
By the way, did you
get the cigars I sent over?
I not only got them,
I enjoyed them, as well.
Oh, my pleasure,
Mr. Vice President.
Well, I've got a ship to run.
Look forward to
our next visit.
As do I.
I got them from a friend.
- Paya!
- Hey, sweetie.
Wow,...
you seem to get an inch
taller every time I see you.
What, I don't
get my handshake?
Well, it's okay Paya.
I have a special surprise for you.
And it's in here.
You wanna come see?
What's he got?
Come on.
What have we got?
Oh, Paya!
I've never been great with kids.
Maybe next time I'll
get one with, uh, two eyes.
See if I can trade her
for something else.
No, it's okay.
You just surprised her.
Well.
Well, um.
Look, I'm not sure...
when i'll be able to make it back.
I know.
I'm gonna have to ask for an extra
hundred since you spent the night.
Well,...
I wondered when you
were going to show up.
49.597 survivors
in search of a home
Called Earth
Raptor one-two-niner.
You are cleared into the break.
Galactica, raptor one-two-niner
has the ball.
Inbound
speed two-two-zero.
Admiral, Colonel,...
I'm just getting started,but...
from the looks of him,
I'd say he was garroted.
Gods. This is the
last thing we needed.
Admiral,...
you might
want to take a look at this.
Looks like our friend,
Fisk, hit the jackpot.
Cubit?
Find anything else,
let me know right away.
If I find anything else,
I may retire early.
Someone's sending
us a message.
Or running us in circles.
Maybe there's another
cylon in the fleet.
I almost prefer that
to the alternative.
We start killing our own,...
all they have to do
is sit back and watch.
Fisk.
Do we have any idea who did it?
No.
But we will do a full investigation
and I want you to lead it.
Don't you think it would be better...
if someone from Pegasus
dealt with this?
Even though Cain's gone, her
influence lingers.
I need someone I can trust.
You know, there were
times when that was in...
short supply between us.
We've both been
through an awful lot, son.
And I hope that we've
grown stronger for it.
I need your help.
I'll call up a flight
to Pegasus right away.
Anyone else been inside?
Just the medical team, sir.
Do you know who I am?
I am the vice President
of the colonies,...
let me in!
Captain Adama.
Commander Fisk didn't tell
me  you were invited.
Let him in.
They were going to let me in.
Oh, my gods!
What's going on in here?
Where's Fisk?
On a slab in Galactica's morgue.
What, he's dead?
Isn't this your brand?
Careful, Gaius.
You've bought yourself some
good will by saving Roslin.
But it's fading.
Their old suspicions
are re-emerging.
What are you doing here?
Captain.
I was about to ask
you the same thing.
Wait a minute.
Are you interrogating me?
I'm not sure I appreciate
your tone.
This isn't a diplomatic exercise.
A man was butchered.
His head was practically severed
from his body with piano wire.
You're Vice President of the fleet.
Why are you acting
like a child...
with your hand
in the cookie jar?
Wonder what she would say if
she saw you like this.
You know I can't believe
it's even necessary...
for me to explain
myself to you.
But obviously, no, I had nothing
to do with Commander Fisk's death.
For the record, I just
came here to discuss...
President Roslin's new trade policy.
Oh, I-I thought that was settled.
No, uh, Commander Fisk
had some reservations.
I'll bet.
And as the vice President,
I decided to assuage his doubts.
Of my own free will.
Is that sufficient?
Or would you like me to
provide you with an alibi?
I'm sure I can rustle one up.
Enjoy the cigars.
Escort the vice
President to his ship.
The wireless is going crazy.
Word of Fisk's murder has spread
out through the entire fleet.
When we lose a command
officer aboard a warship...
people are going to be
concerned about their security.
Crew can fall apart when
their Commander is killed.
Pegasus lost two
in a matter of weeks.
Maybe, this time,
they were lucky.
His personal log shows that he
was rerouting supply runs,...
on- and off-loading freighters
without command authorization.
He raided the McConnell,...
and at least a dozen
other ships in the last week.
I also found
a small warehouse...
of high value merchandise
in his quarters.
He was working
the black market.
Well, half the fleet's working it.
Fisk was getting greedy.
If he crossed one of
his suppliers on a deal,...
that would explain the cubits
that Cottle found.
Still doesn't tell us who did it.
Well, he's going to need
trading partners.
And they wouldn't be hard
to find, even on Galactica.
Lee.
I'm scared.
Paya's cough
keeps getting worse.
I'll bring her something
on my next trip.
Which could be weeks if there's
another cylon attack.
I keep hearing about
shortages on the other ships.
People trading anything they can
for food and for medicine.
Really?
Have you seen all the
new working girls outside?
Lee, when your baby's crying
because it's hungry,...
you'll do anything
to make it stop.
Hey.
Come here.
Mommy.
Captain.
What do you want?
Is your wife around, Colonel?
No.
Why?
Is this hers?
Oh, yeah.
She lost it a
couple weeks ago.
Where the hell
did you find it?
On Pegasus.
In Commander Fisk's quarters.
She's burning up.
What did they say
at the infirmary?
Antibiotics have
all been rationed out.
They said they might have
something by the end of the week.
We got shortages across the fleet.
People begging for scraps.
Somehow, you and Mrs. Tigh
have fresh fruit, real liquor...
All right,...
what the hell is this about?
You must have known she was
trading with Fisk.
Or maybe I'll talk to her.
She didn't give it to Fisk, I did.
I traded it for a few necessities,...
a couple of things to help
her get by, big frakkin' deal.
There's nothing
illegal about that.
Not yet.
Don't you play "holier
than thou" with me.
I haven't done anything that most
people on this ship haven't done.
Including you.
Doesn't make us right, Colonel,
just a whole lot of people wrong.
You didn't make
it to class today.
Yeah, I been pretty jammed up.
Anyway, I'm not sure you need me
holding your hand anymore.
Is that what you were doing?
Holding my hand?
I meant it as a compliment.
Permission to speak frankly, sir?
You don't need my permission and
you don't need the "sir."
Maybe that's the problem.
I don't really know
what to think anymore.
So, I'll just ask.
Is this going somewhere?
Dee...
Please don't pretend like you
don't know what I'm talking about.
You know our time
together, our workouts.
Something's
changed between us.
I'm just not sure
what you want me to say.
Then don't say anything.
Communications paging
captain Adama.
You have a priority
ship-to-ship call, Cloud Nine.
Captain Adama here.
Shevon.
Shevon, it's me.
Shevon!
Oh, my gods!
What did they do?
They said they knew
about you and me.
They wanted to know what we'd
been talking about.
I don't understand
why they'd care.
All right, get what you need.
I'm taking you and Paya
back to Galactica.
Lee, wait.
It's the only place
I can keep you safe.
What are you going to tell
them about us?
I'm not fooling myself.
I know what this is.
Lee!
Get away from us!
You listening?
I hear any more talk about Fisk,...
I'm going send your whore
back to you piece...by piece.
And then I'm going start
with the little girl.
I know who you are.
I know whose son you are.
And I don't care.
You tell Adama to let it go.
Is that when you knew
that you loved her?
I thought so.
But you hurt her.
Yes.
This is captain Adama.
I need a medic and a security
team on L deck, ASAP.
You wanted to see me,
Madame President?
Yes.
Thank you for coming, doctor.
Have a seat.
Would you like some tea?
I'd love one.
You know,...
I'm never quite sure where we
stand with each other, doctor.
Why do you think that is?
I can't imagine why.
I've never had anything but the
utmost respect for you,...
and your office.
I understand that
you and Commander Fisk...
planned to meet just
prior to his death.
As I have already
explained to Captain Adama,...
Commander Fisk had
several lingering concerns...
about your new trade policy.
What can I say?
And that's it?
Gaius, she's afraid of you.
Why...
are you asking me this?
You saved my life.
And I'm grateful.
But I sense that there is some...
unease in you about
assuming the presidency, and...
I'd like to offer you an out.
You what?
Resign.
Return to your scientific
work on Galactica.
No one will
question your motives.
You can consider it a second
chance, like the one you gave me.
Charming.
Doctor.
This is a one-time offer.
I suggest you reconsider.
You know, Madame President,...
I've never been particularly
interested in politics.
I never wanted any
lofty position of power.
I never wanted to
be the Vice President.
That is, until this very moment.
Because right now,...
I can't think of
anything I want more.
One to the head.
You didn't do this?
I was attacked.
Found him there when I woke up.
Security bulletin said...
Commander Fisk was garroted
with a wire.
Whatever happened,
looks like you found your guy.
What about Shevon...
and her daughter.
Cloud Nine's an open port.
Chances are,
they're already off ship.
I'll get a team down here.
Councilman Zarek.
Lee.
I just heard, are you all right?
What are you doing here?
Attending a Quorum meeting.
Nothing as exciting as all
this. I assure you.
I know these places are legal.
But still, the son
of the almighty Adama...
Talk to me about the black market.
Not much to say.
It's widespread,
inevitable,...
and according to
President Roslin...
illegal.
So, it's no surprise that you and
Fisk were in it up to your necks.
Fisk, maybe, but not me.
I represent Astral Queen.
I have to be careful
about the company I keep.
This is Fisk's log.
He says,...
he made three runs to
Astral Queen in the last ten days,...
and I doubt it was to discuss
prison reform.
What do you want from me, Captain?
Names of ships. Contacts.
I can't help you.
Why do you think
Fisk approached me?
To get a piece of your
black market scam.
To offer you protection.
You and your father are so
blinded by the past.
Fisk's black market...
was up and running when
he approached me.
He knew Adama would pick up on
his unauthorized shuttles,...
so he tried to force me into
taking over the deliveries,...
creating a firewall between Pegasus
and the illegal shipments.
So, you're trying to tell me
that you turned him down.
At great cost.
Check the fleet logs.
See how many supply ships
made stops at the Astral Queen...
after last Fisk's trip.
The answer is none.
So, if Fisk was trying
to starve you out,...
why didn't you bring it to the quorum?
Roslin's acting like the black
market's some sort of aberration,...
but I thought you were
smarter than that.
Did you really expect some...
utopian fantasy to
rise from the ashes?
I heard the security officer.
They gave you Fisk's
killer for a reason.
They're offering you a way out.
You know something, don't you?
Just rumors.
There's a freighter,...
Prometheus.
Some people say it's
gone off the grid.
But if you want
something bad enough,...
that's where you go.
The deals are brokered by
an ex-military mercenary named...
Phelan.
Lee.
I hope she's worth it.
Oh, Paya.
Paya!
Paya, hey.
Paya.
It's okay, it's Lee.
You remember,
it's Lee.
All right, you're going to be fine.
I promise you.
Okay, you just hang Tight.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
You may find this hard to believe,
but my father was in the service too.
Strict as hell.
Probably the same as your old man.
But, when the cylons attacked,
all his duty and honor...
didn't add up to squat.
Is she dead?
I can see why you want her back,
she's one of my best.
One of yours.
A good escort...
understands it's
about a lot more than sex.
She knows when to listen...
and when to call for help.
Lee, I had to.
Don't blame her.
The only reason you're alive...
is because I was able to see
you through Shevon's eyes.
And what I saw
seemed reasonable.
Like Fisk.
Fisk was a pig.
He tried to
force us to renegotiate.
So you killed him.
No.
I gave you the killer.
The murder weapon,...
the prints.
Everything you needed to
close the case legitimately.
Despite the President's objections,
the fleet needs us.
Rationing's too tight,...
ship comes in too late, we're the
pressure valve, we provide.
When Shevon needed
antibiotics, she knew where to go.
Without us,...
people would
have nowhere to turn.
The fleet would tear itself apart.
And what about those
children outside?
How are they...
helping the fleet?
Everyone has needs.
Some settle
for cigars or liquor.
You wanted shevon.
Others are more demanding.
It's hard to find...
the moral high ground when
we're all standing in the mud.
I'm not not like
my old man, Captain,...
and you are not like yours.
I came alone.
But, Galactica
tracked me on DRADIS
All they'll need to vent this ship
into space is an excuse.
So, let's make a deal.
I want Shevon, the girl.
I walk out of here,
and you shut down this operation.
And all of you will live.
Sorry, the little girl's been
paid for. No refunds.
Oh, gods!
No!
- Wait.
- Lee, don't.
Come on, do it.
Do it.
I made you a fair offer.
So did I.
Yeah, you're probably
right about everything.
You, me, Fisk.
Nobody can stop it,...
and maybe nobody should.
But it needs limits.
There's lines you can't cross.
And you crossed them.
You're not gonna shoot.
You're not like me.
You're not gonna...
All right, it's done.
Fleet relies on the black market.
Much as we'd like,
we can't wish that away.
So, you're still in business.
For now.
But if they are any more killings,...
if you hold back
essential medicines,...
if you...
ever touch a child...
Shevon.
No, I don't want to see...
Hey, hey. It's over, it's okay,
everything's gonna be okay.
- Lee, Lee, let go.
- Shevon, it's over.
Stop!
I can't be what
you want me to be.
I don't want
you to be anything.
You want me to be her.
That's what this is about.
That's what this has
always been about.
No...
that's not what
this has ever been about.
Come on, Lee.
I know my job.
I'm a replacement.
For a lot of things.
Things that men can't
get anywhere else.
Things they've lost.
She wanted to give you a child.
But you were afraid,...
so you pushed
her away and then you ran.
And you didn't stop running
until it was too late.
Well, I'm not her!
And Paya is not,
and will never be, your child.
Commander Fisk's
murder has been resolved,...
and Pegasus' crew appears to have
accepted Galactica's conclusions.
That's all, Madame President.
Not quite.
What about the ship,
Prometheus?
I understand it's the hub of
the fleet's black market.
We will keep an eye on them.
Keep an eye on 'em?
It's not exactly
the solution I had in mind.
Whether or not we allow
a criminal enterprise...
to thrive in this fleet is not
a matter of choice, Captain.
Admiral?
I've given Lee full authority on
this issue. The decision is his.
I support your trade policies
whole heartedly madame President.
But, we are never going to
have a perfect system.
There will always be some
kind of black market.
At least this way, I know
names, I know faces,...
I know where they are, and
we will monitor the situation.
Thank you, gentlemen, I'm busy.
18, I'm starting to sweat here. 19
- You should be sweating.
- 20
Why aren't you doing any of these?
No talking, no talking. No cheating,
all the way up, a little higher.
- Sneaky.
- 8, 9,...
start again.
- You lost track.
- Zero...
No?
President wasn't very happy today.
No.
Ever since you ejected from
the blackbird, you've been different.
Harder to reach.
I'm just
trying to understand.
Well, like you said, dad.
We've all been through a lot.
Fair enough.
But you should have
told me about the woman.

And They Have A Plan
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica...
Frakk me.
Are you alive?
It's probably a Cylon itself.
More of an animal maybe,
than the human models.
Maybe they genetically design it
to perform a task.
To be a fighter.
- Don't even try defending
- for no frakking reason!
Knock it off!
Knock it off!
You get the hell
out of here, now.
I'm so sick of her.
Come on, come on, come on.
I can't do it.
What the hell happened?
Kat's made the trap 100 times.
What are these?
Stims.
By the look of it, she's been
taking them by the handful.
I was ???????????????
So I taking stims.
It's so stupid.
As soon as I get back to Galactica,
I'll send a rescue party.
Yeah, right.
If I say I'm gonna
do something, I do it.
- Count on it.
- My kind of woman.
The resistance base camp is here.
300 cliks north of the only
Cylon airbase in the area.
I respect what
you trying to do here.
However...
We have a duty to the
people we left behind.
We undestand that.
We have to find a way to
jump back to Caprica...
- and go get then

Colonial Mining Ship Majahual
29th Day of operations
Entering section two-five-nine.
Keep your eyes open, Kat.
This is where BB and Jo-JoĀ
bought it.
Come on out, Scar, you ugly
cylon son of a bitch. Let's party!
Yeah, I don't think he's
gonna RSVP, Kat.
He prefers surprise parties.
Yeah, well be surprised when
I blow his ass apart.
Yeah, that'll be the day.
Cassie.
Cassie, wasn't that her name?
Whose name?
Reilly's girlfriend.
You know what Kat, I told you
I have no frakkin' idea,...
so give it rest, all right?
94 hours ago
Reilly's dead for
one very simple reason.
He couldn't
control his fear.
Yup, poor idiot cut and ran.
Gave the toaster a free
shot up his ass.
Scar spooked him.
He saw that motherfrakker's
red eye coming straight for him,...
and he panicked.
Reilly was a good stick.
A little short on guts,
but a good stick.
Beano who had plenty.
Took Cally an hour to
clean out his cockpit.
Hey, does anybody remember
the name of Reilly's girlfriend?
No.
Karen, I think.
Died on Picon. Karen.
No, was it Kather.. Kathy?
You guys, what does it matter?
Gonna hold a little prayer circle?
Good cry? The whole thing?
Actually. It does matter.
Hi.
Hey. This is Ensign Baxton.
Ensign Clark.
And I guess
we're your new bunkmates.
Welcome.
We just finished, uh,
viper training on pegasus.
Ready to kick some Cylon butt.
So was Beano.
Who's, uh, Beano?
Right here.
Ooh, Scar's gonna smoke you
like a fine cigar, my man.
Who's Scar?
Not who. What.
Toaster's top gun.
Deadliest raider in the cylon fleet.
Gimme break.
Come on they're machines.
One's the same as the next.
Yeah, that's what we thought till
Cap Thrace cut the brain out of one.
Scar's the best they got.
Lotta pilots die going
after that bastard.
Why do they call him Scar?
You'll find out soon enough.
He's got a taste for nuggets.
Easy pickings.
Starbuck, I think I got something.
Big spud, lower rim.
You see that?
Negative.
A time you'd have
noticed it before me.
Fine, you're the shooter.
Try to keep up!
Yeah, just don't screw up.
- So,...
88 Hours Ago
how does Scar take out an
experienced pilot like Beano?
- He hides...
- He hides behind an asteroid.
Or the debris field
that you've ignored.
Because it looked like a
bunch of harmless rocks.
You see, Scar doesn't
like to fight...
until the odds are
on his side.
And then, suddenly
out of nowhere, bam.
He pops out,
blows you to pieces.
And then jumps away
before you can return fire.
Well, if you ask me,
I think Scar's a coward.
This isn't dueling
pistols at dawn, this is war.
You never wanna fight fair.
You wanna sneak up
behind your enemy,...
and club 'em over the head.
You see, Scar understands that.
And so do I.
So, that's why
I'm gonna kill him.
You?
Starbuck, you can barely walk.
Look who's talking, Stim Junkie.
You know,...
I wouldn't be calling anyone a
junkie if I were you Starbuck.
Not the way you been pounding
back that booze lately.
One Tigh on the ship's enough.
Uh,
I got...
I got 200 here.
Says I nail Scar's chrome-plated
ass. And when I do?
You hand that top gun over
to me and pour me my first drink.
Your lips'll never touch
the rim, little girl.
We'll see.
Starbuck!
Maybe you should slow down.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Starbuck! Starbuck!
Starbuck! Starbuck!
Comin' in hot!
Checkers green.
Speed 250!
Oh, yeah,Ā it's gotta be Scar.
Found your hiding place,
you little frakker.
Starbuck, kiss your 200 goodbye.
49.593 survivors
in search of a home
Called Earth
This guy's mine.
Something's definitely wrong.
That can't be Scar.
He should be jumping,
or wheeling to gun at us.
I'll check
our tails.
Frakk!
Frakk, I'm hit
Scar got me!
I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit!
See, Beano opened fire too early.
You guys,...
you gotta fill the
windscreen with the sucker...
or you're not gonna hit him.
See,Ā look.
He's still not close enough.
Beano's already dead, he just
doesn't know it yet.
Do any of you guys see where
he wentĀ wrong?
There, you see that glint?
There.
That's a Raider.
If beano hadn't fixated on
his target, he'd have seen that.
Was it Scar?
There he is, boys and girls.
There's the motherfrakker
I'm gonna kill.
I'm afraid this
is one of those...
good news, bad
news conversations.
Bad news first.
The mining chip's broken
another drill bit.
We need to extend again.
Another eight days.
Eight more days.
Son of a bitch.
They've just discovered an
incredibly rich vein of ore.
Enough to build two entire
squadrons of vipers.
I can't walk away from that.
What's the good news?
The Pegasus production team
has just turned out...
its first combat-ready viper.
We are beginning to
replace our losses.
Hmm. Are they going to be
able to replace pilots as well?
Let's review the tactical
situation.
Four weeks ago,...
our mining ships struck pay
dirt on this asteroid.
A pile of strategicĀ metals
that we need to build new ships.
Since we're sitting ducks
until the miners finish the job,...
the old man has sent the
fleet out of harm's way...
under the protection of Pegasus.
Our job is to stay
behind and protect the miners.
Unfortunately, this star system
is full of rocks and dust.
Dradis cannot tell the rocks
from the bad guys,...
so our only reliable
system of detection is...
Our eyeballs.
Which means we have to put
those eyeballs way out there.
Split up, cover a huge perimeter.
We'll be patrolling the area
in divisions of four...
at these picket points.
Twos, we're going in
sections of twos.
Are you planning
the ops for me now too?
CAG wants us to spread out to
control a larger area.
It's right here in the briefings.
All right.
So, we do go in twos.
Scar and his buddies are out there.
Looking for easy kills.
Let's not give him any.
This operation is vital...
to the long term
survival of this fleet.
Yes, it is.
And we'll
continue to support it.
They're grinding us down,
viper by viper.
Why'd they stop
coming at us en masse?
Is it because we destroyed
the resurrection ship?
Starbuck's working on that.
This guy's probably died and
been reborn a dozen times.
You may have faced him before.
So what, raiders reincarnate?
Just like you?
Yeah, just like me.
Great.
What a frakkin' world.
A raider's much
like a trained animal,...
with the basic consciousness
and survival instinct.
But with the destruction of
the resurrection ship,...
when they die,...
they're really dead.
So,...
they're not gonna
mount mass attacks...
where they could have
major casualties.
Raiders reincarnate?
Makes sense, doesn't it?
It takes months for
you to train a nugget...
into an effective
viper pilot.
And then they get killed.
And their experience,
their knowledge,
their skill sets.
They're all lost forever.
So, if you could
bring 'em back...
and put 'em in a
brand new body,...
wouldn't you do it?
'Cause death then becomes a
learning experience.
How, uh...how many pilots
haveĀwe lost?
I mean, have you lost?
You know, there are
times when I look at you
and I forget
what you are.
All I see is...
that kid...
that pooched her
landings day after day.
The kid that was
frakkin' the chief...
and thinking she was
getting away with it.
Yeah, I remember.
You were like a big sister to...
Kara, um...be careful
of Scar, okay?
He's filled with rage.
About what?
Dying's a painful and
traumatic experience.
Every time he's reborn, he's
filled with more bitter memories.
Scar hates you every bit as
much as you hate him.
A raider is a squirmy
son of a bitch.
You won't be able to
keep him in your sights...
for more than two seconds.
So, you have to deliver
a killing burst...
within that time or
he will turn and nail you.
All that yanking and banking gives
you one hell of a case of vertigo.
And that is what this chair
simulates.
All right, Jo-Jo.
Go!
Time!
Not bad.
At least you hit the target.
Yeah, but that's a lot better
than I did the first time.
I think I took out that
clock over there.
So, what's the all time record?
Four hits on the x-ring.
Are you kidding? Who did that?
I did.
Mind if I give it a
shot for old times sake?
Be my guest.
Two seconds. Go.
Time!
- Five.
- Yes!
Frakk! I'm hit, I'm hit!
Scar got me!
I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit.
Kat, Starbuck.
Where the hell are you?
Starbuck, I lost visual on you.
Starbuck, what's your position?
Primary and secondary hydraulics
are bent. I can deal with it.
Starbuck, I got no visual on you,
where you at?
Forget it, Kat. Scar's mine.
Don't be an idiot, Starbuck,
what's your position?
Yeah, you remember me, don't you?
You want my ass so bad,
you can taste it.
Well keep coming.
'Cause I guaran-frakkin-tee you,...
I will put you down
this time for good.
42 Hours Ago
One more.
Come on, Starbuck, let's go.
Get it up there.
Why are you pushing so hard?
Kat's just another hot shot
kid out toĀmake her bones.
Like you were
before you met Anders.
You ever think about him?
What's the point?
He's dead.
Kara.
If you didn't think he
had a chance of surviving,...
why'd you promise to return
with a rescue party?
I thought I was...
I don't know
what I thought.
Captain Thrace. If Scar
jumps us out there, um...
Keep your eyes open so he can't.
Okay. But, if I screw up and he
bushwhacks me, what do I do then?
Come on!
They drilled this into you
over and over and over...
again at basic air combat.
I know, sir, but Scar's
something I'm not...
Scar is no different
than any other attacker.
He comes at you, turn
into him, get closer,...
pull the trigger.
Turn into him, get closer,
pull the trigger. Thank you, sir.
Don't run, or you'll die.
Right.
What are you waiting for?
Nothing, sir.
Come here.
Come here,
I want to talk to you.
Now listen me,...
you're flying Duck's
wing today. Baxton, right?
Yes, call sign BB, sir.
Okay, that's one of our best
pilots that we got.
Okay, so just do what he says,
and you'll be fine.
Just don't let the raiders
get anywhere near the miners.
- Okay.
- Yeah. Thank you, sir.
Okay, go get 'em, tiger.
Starbuck.
That kid needs more than a
pat on the ass...
and a textbook quote
about tactics, okay?
You wanna be his wet-nurse,
go right ahead, all right?
Be my guest.
His jacket says he's a
qualified viper jock.
So, I either fly him,...
or I ground him and
then we go up short.
What's it gonna be?
Your call, Kat.
Galactica, Starbuck.
Wilco return to base.
Roger, Starbuck.
BB, Duck.
Four raiders. From
behind the rocket, left ten.
Coming hard, looks like Scar.
Duck, BB. What do we do?
We don't have enough fuel to
mix it up.
We bug out, BB.
Let our relief deal with 'em.
We're going home.
Negative! Starbuck said to
turn into any attack.
Weapons hot!
You're bingo fuel. Don't
attack, you idiot.
Gods damn it, BB. This is
the frakkin' exception.
Abort and reform.
Duck, Starbuck. Position?
Four-two alpha.
Behind the big spud.
We need a hand,
right frakkin' now.
You're on your own, Duck.
Everybody's way out of range.
Duck, be there in six minutes.
Duck, Kat. Eight minutes out.
Duck, they're on
my six, oh, my god.
It's all right, Jo-Jo.
Verify pc-2 pressure zero,
throttles closed,...
oxygen, generator and master
switches off.
Check. Shutdown complete.
Nothing you could do, Captain.
You were too far away.
Nice work, Starbuck.
What the hell happened to BB?
What happened?
He did exactly
what you told him to do, Captain.
Him and Duck had bingo fuel
and a head start home,...
but instead the FNG
turned and attacked.
And Scar lit him up like a pinwheel.
Why'd he try to take Scar
on by himself?
Stupid idiot.
"Try to run and your
dead."
I heard you, you drilled that
into the poor moron's head.
You know what?
You and I both know that 99%
of the time that is the right move.
Hmm, not this time.
You know what gets me?
I know that in two weeks,...
I won't remember his face.
I can't remember any of their
faces after they're killed.
No matter how hard I try,
they just fade.
I don't even remember
their names.
Names.
Oh, let's see, there was...
there was Flattop.
Who bought it on
his thousandth landing.
There was Chuckles.
Stop it, already.
Please, not funny.
- All right.
- It's not funny.
It is funny.
You know the President...
says that we're saving
humanity for...
a bright, shiny future...
on Earth.
That you and
I are never gonna see.
We're not.
Because we go out...
over and over again...
until someday, some metal motherfrakker...
is gonna catch us on a
bad day and just blow us away.
Bright, shiny futures
are overrated anyway.
That is why...
we gotta get
what we can.
Right now.
I'll drink to that.
To right now.
So, why don't we?
Why don't we what?
Wait a minute.
- What?
- Wait a minute.
Ow. Hey, slow down.
Whoa, this isn't a race.
Kara,
what's going on?
What's going on?
What's wrong
with you, all right?
Okay, you know what? I don't
wanna know. I don't wanna know.
Hey, what about us?
There is no us, all right?
I just wanted a good lay.
There is nothing here.
Do you get that? Nothing.
Sure.
My gods.
Hey.
Well, that's just great.
Frakk or fight, huh?
Okay,...
maybe I am just a quick lay.
But, Kara, I'm also your friend.
I am hung up on a dead guy, okay?
And it is pissing me off.
And I don't know what I'm doing.
Anders, right? On caprica,
the resistance fighter.
Yeah, well, Samuel's
dead so what does it matter?
Oh, Kara please.
- I don't need your pity, Lee!
- For once in your life...
you haven't got my pity!
Listen, you are fine, you're
fine with the dead guys.
It's the living
guys you can't deal with.
There you are. I got visual
on you Starbuck.
I'm inbound
about 15 out.
Now!
All right, Scar,...let's see
how much you like...
playing chicken when
you can't download, bitch.
How's it feel,
you bastard?
One of us is gonna have
to break away first...
and it isn't gonna be me!
Starbuck, wake up!
He's a machine,
he's not gonna break.
You're committing suicide, Starbuck!
3 hours ago
In two on two engagements,...
cylon raiders like to
isolate individual vipers,...
and then gang up on one,...
hoping to kill it before his
wingman has a chance to protect him.
Captain
Which is exactly what happened
to Jo-Jo 20 minutes ago.
Frakk me,...
was it Scar?
Bastard smoked Jo-Jo and
jumped away in less than 15 s...
before his wingman
could get a shot off.
And, where were you?
What?
Flight schedule had you flying lead
for Jo-Jo on that patrol.
So...
why'd you assign
Snake to take your place?
Was it too early in the morning
for you, Starbuck?
What exactly are you trying
to say, lieutenant?
What I'm trying to say, Captain,...
is maybe if you weren't up
all night drinking,...
Jo-Jo would have still been here.
Give us the room.
What is it with you, Katraine?
Ever since I got back,...
you've been on my
ass like a bad rash.
You know, coming late for a
briefing 'cause your hung over,...
that's bad enough. But when
you back out on a mission?
I put Snake in my place because
I was in no condition to fly.
And I knew that.
You see, unlike you, I don't
take a bunch of pills,...
and then climb
into my cockpit so wired...
that I can't land the frakkin' ship.
Starbuck,...
you're an embarrassment.
You used to be the hottest
stick on the fleet.
Now,...
you're just
a reckless drunk...
that sends other people
out to get killed.
What're you gonna do, hmm?
What are you gonna do,
you gonna hit me Starbuck?
It's scares you, does it?
Actually, no.
You're afraid most
of the time, Kat.
You're afraid that
you're gonna end up...
like that picture
of Reilly's girlfriend.
Some little,...
forgotten...
picture that nobody
really remembers.
You see, that's why you're
riding my ass so hard.
So, no one will
notice that Scar...
scares the living
crap out of you.
Ten-hut!
What's going on?
Little tactical discussion, sir.
Well, it must
have been lively.
Right, I'm pairing you two up.
Kat, I want you to fly
Starbuck's wing out by the big spud.
Sir, I...
I got a hunch a
couple of raiders...
are gonna try and
sneak through that sector.
So, I want my heavy
hitters out there to greet 'em.
Skid's up in 49 minutes.
Sir
Starbuck.
Are you okay?
Colonial Mining Ship Majahual
29th Day of operations
Entering section two-five-nine.
Keep your eyes open, Kat.
This is where BB and Jo-Jo bought it.
Cassie, Cassie!
Maybe that was her name.
You know, Kat, I told you I
have no frakkin' idea,...
so give it a rest, all right?
Whoa, hold up Starbuck.
Did you see that?
Oh yeah!
It's gotta be Scar.
Something's definitely wrong.
That can't be Scar.
Frakk! I'm hit
Scar got me. I'm hit,
I'm hit, I'm hit!
Don't be an idiot, Starbuck,
what's your position?
Now, you remember me, don't you?
There you are.
Got visual on you, Starbuck.
I'm inbound about 15 out.
All right, Scar, let's see how much
you like playing chicken...
when you can't download, you bitch.
How's it feel, you bastard?
One of us is gonna have
to break away first...
and it isn't gonna be me!
Starbuck, I'm inbound your
starboard, Seven high at ten.
Starbuck, wake up!
He's a machine, he's not
gonna break!
He's a machine,
he's not gonna break!
I got nothing to lose.
You're committing suicide, Starbuck!
I'm coming back.
I said it.
I meant it.
Yeah, okay.
Gods damn it!
I am gonna put
him right in front of you.
Do not miss him,
you frakkin' stim junkie.
And that's the way it's done!
Yeah, let's go home, skipper! whoo!
Yo, Starbuck!
Hey, Starbuck!
My cup runneth dry.
Seems I recall someone boasting...
that my lips would
never touch this rim.
You earned it.
To BB.
Jo-Jo,
Reilly,
Beano,
Dipper,
Flattop,
Chuckles,
Jolly,
Crashdown,
Sheppard,
Dash,
Flyboy,
Stepchild,
Puppet,
Fireball.
To all of 'em.
So say we all.
I could have done it, you know.
Could have taken out Scar.
Head on pass.
Straight for him.
Just needed to get a little closer.
So, why didn't you do it?
Probably would have
died in the process.
The bastard was too good.
Couple months ago,...
I wouldn't have even
thought about that.
Would have just
gone for the glory...
hoping I could pull it out
of the fire somehow.
Quit kicking yourself.
You did the right thing
and called in your wingman.
Okay?
Scar's dead.
You and Kat came back alive.
It's not why I did it though.
Can't get Anders out of my head.
Can't get over this insane
hope that maybe he's alive.
You got something to live for now.
Not just die for.
He's down for the count. Uh!
<i>Previously
on Battlestar Galactica...</i>
Hi, um...
we're-we're kinda lost again.
We're trying to get
to the CIC. Could you-
alking,
no talking, please.
No cheating.
Hold it up a little higher.
Eight.
Sneaky.
Nine.
Uh... start again.
You lost track.
Zero.
I've asked you here
to find out
why the Cylons
hate us so much.
It's what you said
at the ceremony.
<i>That humanity
was a flawed creation.</i>
And that people still
kill one another
<i>for petty jealousy
and greed.</i>
HmYosaid that humanity
never asked itself
why it deserved to survive.
Maybe you don't.
<i>Sleeper... agents...</i>
<i>within the Fleet.</i>
<i>Takeover by brute force...</i>
<i>Cylon impregnation...</i>
<i>and reproduction...</i>
<i>Multiple models...</i>
<i>suicide bombings...</i>
assault on natural resources.
<i>Eyewitnesses claim to have seen
one of the known Cylon models</i>
<i>moving in and out
of Galactica's brig.</i>
<i>Admiral Adama
has made no comment</i>
<i>on this situation.</i>
<i>We will continue to-</i>
How the hell did this
get out to the press?
<i>I'm surpri
it didn't happen sooner.</i>
m told you've been meeting
with her regularly,
allowing her to interact
with members of your crew.
<i>She's a military asset,</i>
providing us with vital
strategic intelligence.
While we pray
that she's not somehow...
colluding
with other Cylons.
If I felt for one second
<i>that she posed some kind
of a threat to this fleet,</i>
I'd pull the trigger
on her myself.
<i>I think the fleet</i>
may need to hear that,
Admiral.
Even more,
they need ve it.
Someone took theto vitamins
this morning.
Yeah, I don't know
what got into me.
No, you're right.
Keeping Sharon Valerii alive,
allowing her pregnancy
to continue-
There is no road map
for any of this.
Somebody,
somebody has got to keep
asking the hard questions.
I agree. I wanna stay ahead of this.
Acknowledge the Cylons'
existence, and then make...
some kind of case for her
to stay aboard Galactica.
I don't think
that's gonna work.
What?
Why?
I think you need
to trust the people.
Use the press,
tell them the truth.
I mean, we barely know
anything about the Cylons.
And until we learn more,
we're not gonna destroy
the only source of information
that we have, period.
Period.
That simple, huh?
Uh... well...
Um, could I-
could I have a minute?
Sure.
Important? Mm-hmm.
You were saying
about the hard questions...
I know it's just my
debate team ring,
but it's the best I could do.
This... this really isn't
how I planned it.
Anyway, um...
Billy...
I love you.
I've loved you since-
since the first day I met you.
I mean, you were half naked,
granted...
I know that I kind of
blindsided you with this.
Okay? I mean, it doesn't have
to be tomorrow.
We can take our time.
Billy, I can't marry you.
I don't know how else
to say it.
I'm sorry.
<i>He pulled out that ring...</i>
and it was like
an electric shock.
I could barely say anything.
Well, maybe you're regretting
that you didn't say yes.
No.
I don't know what to make
of me and Billy, but...
I know I can't marry him.
Then again, I don't know what
to make of you and me either.
'Scuse me.
Hey, two more.
<i>Coming right up.</i>
Ellen.
<i>It's, uh...
it's... good to see you.</i>
It's good to see you,
Captain.
Dee.
Billy.
I didn't know
you were coming down here.
I, um... I grabbed
a two-day rotation.
I thought I'd grab
some R & R.
I'm on business,
as usual.
Captain Adama.
Oh...
I really am an idiot,
aren't I?
No, Billy-
Don't.
Don't bother. Can you give us a minute?
<i>No, you know what?
Have a seat, Captain.</i>
Be my guest.
Billy, I'm sorry.
I thought if anything,
we were honest
with each other.
But you knew you were gonna
be here with him today,
and you let me propose
to you. I didn't-
I know that giving you
that ring was stupid.
That's fine.
And maybe this wasn't
gonna work out between us.
But this...
You should've told me
about this.
Well, it's hard, you know?
To choose the people
we fall in love with.
To love only one person
at a time.
People like us...
<i>are more complicated.</i>
Us?
I'm sorry.
I'm here with friends.
Ellen, you're a regular
here, right?
<i>You ever see
that woman before?</i>
<i>In the corner?</i>
Oh... only when I came in
and wondered
when they were gonna start
enforcing a dress code.
Ellen, the bathroom's
over here.
Are you serious?
Let's go.
Lee Adama,
you amaze me.
Shh.
This is it now.
You ready?
Yes.
We're with you.
Do it.
Everybody by the bar!
Now! Move!
You, you-t up against the bar
Oh, my gods.
Three men, one wan,
all armed.
<i>Is it true</i>
the Fleet knows
I'm on Galactica?
I'm interested
in navigational weaknesses.
<i>Worm holes, dark matter
blind spots.</i>
Likely ambushes.
I would avoid
these pulsar pointers
because of dradis
interference.
<i>If I was gonna plan
an ambush, I'd do it there.</i>
<i>It depends, Admiral.</i>
They adapt to your every move.
Every move
triggers a counter-move.
Adapt.
That's what
you're good at, right?
Why won't you
answer my question?
Does the Fleet know
<i>I'm on Galactica?</i>
<i>Mm.</i>
It's the baby.
She's kicking.
The Fleet knows.
That'll be all
for today.
Guards.
You know, if people knew
how much you've relied
on that thing's
so-called intelligence,
they'd be scared
out of their wits.
What about you, Saul?
Are you afraid of her?
You know,
the truth is...
I don't like the way
it gotten under your skin.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
The pressure hatch can withstand
explosive decompression.
The only way help's getting in
<i>is with a raft
of high explosives.</i>
Or we could just let
these clowns
open the pressure door for us.
There's bound to be a security
force on its way soon.
Open the door for us?
Why would they do that?
Gimme your drink.
Let me talk to them.
The ice-
I need the dry ice.
Okay, stay calm.
<i>Ellen!</i>
<i>Please don't shoot.</i>
Who are you?
Ellen Tigh.
<i>Get over here. Now.</i>
<i>Move.</i>
<i>We are not criminals.</i>
We are members of the Fleet,
just like you.
My husband's XO of Galactica.
<i>You've just made the worst
mistakes of your life.</i>
Colonel Tigh, Admiral-
you need to hear this.
<i>Saul-</i>
Ellen? What's wrong?
<i>They're holding us hostage.</i>
They're threatening
to kill us!
<i>My name is Sesha Abinell.</i>
<i>I have seized control
of the Cloud Nine lounge...</i>
<i>and held the people in it
hostage.</i>
What do you want?
What I want...
<i>This is not about...
what I want.</i>
The Colonial Fleet
<i>has become
a Cylon-occupied territory.</i>
<i>You are working in collusion
with a Cylon agent-</i>
<i>The very same model
of a Cylon</i>
<i>who tried to murder you,
Admiral Adama,</i>
<i>on your own ship.</i>
We want Sharon Valerii.
<i>You have two hours.</i>
Get me everything you can
on Sesha Abinell.
Yes, sir.
<i>Sesha Abinell...</i>
<i>Fleet records indicate
she's the widow</i>
<i>of a Ray Abinell.</i>
He was a casualty aboard
the Greenleaf freighter
when the Cylons hit it
about ten weeks ago.
Widow.
Who do we have
aboard Cloud Nine?
Uh, rotation schedule shows...
Captain Adama,
<i>half a Marine squad,</i>
<i>and Starbuck's already there
on R & R.</i>
Get me Starbuck
right away.
Yes, sir.
Hell, one of you beauties has
got to be an O-2 sensor.
And I'm guessing it's you.
Take a sip
of carbon dioxide.
There was another guy
at the bar.
Check the back.
We don't want any more mistakes.
Kern, ere's anawful lot
of military types here.
<i>And that's why we're here.</i>
To get Galactica's
attention, remember?
Page.
You go.
No problem.
Good to see ya, Gunny.
I'm gonna need
some of those gorillas
you call Marines.
Most of my gorillas
are already here, sir.
<i>Just trying to cop
a little R & R.</i>
Tell me about it.
All right,
here's what we know.
We got an unknown number
of shooters
at least 20 hostages.
And about a 90-minute window
before they start
throwing out bodies.
You got a plan, sir?
Lock and load.
Let's figure out the rest
as we go along.
Put your weapon down.
Tell them.
He says he's Captain Adama
from the Galactica.
<i>He just wants to talk.</i>
Talk, that's it.
Just talk.
<i>They're together.</i>
Put it down.
Or she dies.
Hey, she dies, he dies,
you get it?
Difference is,
you won't do it.
He will.
Okay?
We all have someone
we care about.
It's his son.
He's not gonna choose the Cylon
over his son.
<i>Get in line with the others.</i>
CO-2 is through the roof.
They're trying
to suffocate us.
What is this, a trap?
<i>There's a reason
you don't just start shooting</i>
on a spaceship.
You probably nicked a line.
<i>Why don't you let me
talk to the Admiral,</i>
see if we can't
find a way out of this?
<i>I've got</i>
two strike teams
inbound to you.
ETA ten minutes.
We'll have plenty of fire power,
so that's good.
But I'm concerned
with limited accesedints.
<i>Admiral.</i>
<i>It's Abinell.</i>
<i>Keep Starbuck
on the line with us.</i>
Adama.
We're losing oxygen.
If it's not restored,
the hostages die.
Then you'll all die.
Because this is over.
Not until the Cylon's dead.
I'm willing to die
to see this through.
You willing to risk
your son's life?
Son of a bitch.
Suddenly you're listening.
<i>Gods damn it,</i>
give her what she wants!
<i>Give her the Cylon!</i>
You're all alone
on this, Admiral.
<i>I'm not gonna sacrifice
a military asset</i>
on your altar of revenge.
What are you talking about?
This isn't a-
<i>You said this was about us
being played by the Cylons.</i>
<i>But it isn't.</i>
<i>It's about the loss of your
husband, and I understand that.</i>
<i>It's about you wanting
to strike back,</i>
<i>and I understand that too.</i>
But we've all lost people
that we care about.
An learn to live with it.
<i>I am sure
you are aware, Admiral,</i>
of the concrete evidence...
that Caprica's defenses
were compromised
by a Cylon agent
who infiltrated
the Ministry of Defense
on the eve of the attacks.
People look
for complicated answers
when something terrible
happens.
<i>Maybe we were just
caught by surprise</i>
and were beaten.
And maybe we have to learn
to live with that.
<i>And maybe you are
just missing the point.</i>
You were infiltrated.
You.
The military.
And you are being infiltrated
again right now.
You can sit there and pretend
you know what you're doing,
but you do not.
You are being played.
And the rest of us do not want
to go down with your ship.
<i>I want this air system
restored right now.</i>
<i>One person comes in alone,
fixes it, leaves.</i>
Anything goes wrong,
somebody gets hurt,
it's on your head.
Keep a direct line open
to Cloud Nine.
What do we do?
We repair the air system.
Saul, we can't
give her Sharon.
I hope you
know that, right?
I know that.
We can't start dealing
with the terrorists.
We start now,
it'll open the floodgates,
and it'll never stop.
But by the way,
it's not "Sharon".
It's a frakkin' Cylon.
You don't think I know that?
I think there's part of you that
looks into that thing's eyes
and still sees that yo trl
that reported aboard two years
ago as a rook pilot.
Well, it's not.
<i>It never was.</i>
Bill, it's a machine.
<i>Admiral?</i>
It's Captain Thrace.
Sitrep.
<i>I had one
of the Cloud Nine techs</i>
double-check the oxygen feed
in there.
There's nothing wrong
with the air.
<i>Could be a glitch.</i>
Or maybe someone screwed
with one of the CO-2 censors
inrs bar.
Lee.
Why?
<i>Maybe he's giving us
an opening.</i>
If I can get someone inside,
get a clear idea
of what we're dealing with-
<i>Kara, this is a recon mission.</i>
<i>Get someone to volunteer.</i>
Then you assess the situation.
<i>And then get the hell out of
there. Do you understand?</i>
Yes, sir.
<i>I'm here to repair
the O-2 line.</i>
Captain, what
are you doing?
Volunteering.
Let me see that.
<i>Close the hatch.</i>
<i>Search her.</i>
You might not want
to do that.
You're running out
of air in here.
Looks clean.
Do your job.
Cover her.
<i>Wait a minute.
Turn around slowly.</i>
Check the box again.
We're hot.
Let's go.
Get down!
Get down!
We gotta get out!
Now!
Come on!
Billy.
<i>Billy.</i>
I need shirts, towels-
anything I can use as a bandage.
Billy!
<i>Nobody said you could move.</i>
You still want the Cylon?
<i>Do you?</i>
Because if
the admiral's son dies,
you're not gonna get a deal,
you get that?
If he dies, you're not
gonna get what you want.
He's right.
Let him go.
Sir, it's Starbuck.
We got a report of gunshots.
What's happening?
My cover was blown.
I had to move.
I'm sorry.
<i>Any casualties?</i>
<i>Two marines.</i>
<i>Probably KIA...</i>
At least one of the gunmen...
And Lee.
It was crazy in there,
confused.
<i>He got hit.</i>
How bad?
I don't know.
<i>Stand by.</i>
Hold your position.
Make no move unless
you hear from me.
<i>It was friendly fire.</i>
Lee got hit
by friendly fire.
I think it was me.
I gotta stop
the bleeding.
I can't tell
if it hit an artery,
or...
Lee?
Don't leave me.
Lee, Lee.
Don't leave me, okay?
Please.
Hey.
<i>He's gonna be okay.</i>
He's gonna be okay.
<i>Just hang in there, come on.</i>
Stay with me.
Please, stay with me.
<i>Are you playing with us?</i>
Are you playing with me?
I've saved the ship.
Saved you.
How many times now?
<i>Five? Six?</i>
You just can't believe
I'm not plotting against you.
<i>You know that there are Cylons
within this Fleet.</i>
You know what they look like.
<i>You know where
to find them.</i>
<i>If I were to ask you,</i>
would you tell me
who they are?
No.
That I believe.
He'll be all right.
Thanks for the concern.
<i>She loses a husband,
and suddenly the world</i>
<i>owes her an explanation.</i>
He was a good man.
And he wasn't just her husband.
He was my brother.
My brother died on Picon.
He was a good man too.
They're all good men.
<i>The Abinell woman sent over
a manifesto to the press</i>
before they took over
the bar.
It's mostly a collection
of rumor and conspiracy theories
about Cylons in the military
and the government.
Bunch of crap.
It's getting
a lot of attention.
We gotta get our people
out of there.
You have Marines
on Cloud Nine.
<i>Pressure door</i>
to the room has been resealed.
If we try blowing it open,
we'll need so much G-4,
<i>we'd risk killing
everyone inside.</i>
<i>There are no options</i>
left except for one.
<i>No.</i>
We don't strike deals with
terrorists. We can't.
We give them Sharon Valerii,
<i>we're inviting terrorism</i>
and we weaken our position
permanently, you know that.
<i>Gentlemen, everyone in that
room is someone's son,</i>
<i>someone's wife,
someone's mother.</i>
Billy is the closest thing
that I have to family
left in this world.
And if you don't think
that that...
confuses things emotionally
for me-
<i>Let's not be naive.</i>
What if they're right?
What if Sharon
has been playing us all,
plotting our destruction
with every passing day?
<i>What if the terrorists
are right?</i>
This isn't about Sharon.
<i>It's about something
much bigger than that.</i>
<i>It's about the long-term
survival, it's about the way</i>
we conduct ourselves
in all of this.
<i>Sir?</i>
It's Abinell on the line.
How's my son?
<i>Alive.</i>
<i>But my friend is dead.</i>
<i>So are two of your soldiers.</i>
<i>And your son's dying.</i>
You know, I thought
a long time about this.
About what I'd do...
about how far I'd go...
<i>And I honestly did not know</i>
<i>until this moment...</i>
Chu.
What?
What?
Get on your feet.
What are you gonna do?
Saul, give them
what they want!
<i>It's just a machine!</i>
They're gonna kill her.
Hold your fire.
I'm giving you the Cylon.
But you won't be alive.
<i>What does that mean?</i>
That is not the deal.
<i>It means
that you've convinced me</i>
that wy
have been played.
And if that be the case,
and she's been playing with me,
<i>then I can't take
any more chances.</i>
So you make up your mind.
<i>If you wanShon Valerii,</i>
<i>you can have her.</i>
But on my terms.
<i>I give you the body,</i>
<i>you give me the hostages.</i>
Done.
Cut the wire.
Admiral.
Let me help.
Please.
Let me take it
from here.
Let's go.
<i>Stop looking at him, Billy.</i>
I can see you watching him.
I know you think
you can get that gun.
<i>I'm only thinking in case
something happens. No.</i>
You're not a soldier.
You're not trained for that.
<i>You've got nothing
to prove.</i>
I know.
They're right outside.
We open up,
they'll give us the body.
Okay.
<i>We're opening the door.</i>
<i>But if anything goes wrong...</i>
we start killing
hostages.
Do it.
It's over.
Wait-
<i>This isn't right.</i>
This one's been dead
for weeks.
Their Cylon is still alive.
Kill the girlfriend.
Down, report.
All clear.
I need help over here!
Medic!
Lee.
Lee, can you hear me?
Lee!
Can you hear me, Lee?
Come on, son.
Come on, hurry up.
That's good.
Billy.
No.
Billy.
<i>Is this what you gave 'em?</i>
It was a calculated risk.
It wasn't worth it.
Oh, dear.
Well, that's better.
That's better.
He was so young.
Hey.
Hey...
<i>What is it?</i>
Nothing.
When you're feeling better,
we can talk.
This was a hell
of a vacation.
Yeah.
Lee?
Lee, you can't leave.
You have to stay.
You have to really stay.
You understand?
It's okay.
I'll be here when you wake up.
I'll be right here.

RAPTOR TRAINING EXERCISE
Pegasus, Buster.
Dradis intercept
training birds are away.
Buster, Pegasus, roger that,
take station...
be advised,...
communications will suffer
sporadic interruptions...
due to stellar EMI
activity. Acknowledge?
Pegasus, Buster, acknowledge.
Our communications suck!
Is it gonna be
like this all day?
Big time.
Those binaries are
putting out so much EMI,...
even the dradis
is barely working.
Well, I'm gonna a little distance
between us and the fleet.
Get us out of the soup.
See if we can get a cleaner
dradis picture.
Hey!
Whoever's in there, time's up!
Let's go, come on!
Gotta a couple of tired viper
jockeys out here wanna sleep.
Go hit the showers Duck!
We'll be gone by
the time you get back.
How you feel?
Mm, not great.
But Cottle's given me the thumbs-up
and it's been almost a month,...
so I guess it's back to work.
So you ready to go into the belly
of the beast?
The beast?
Yeah.
That's what they call the
Pegasus now.
Galactica's the bucket.
The bucket and the beast.
Don't we make a pair?
Come on.
- No, you come on.
- Come on, come on, go.
Anyway, it's only a
temporary assignment.
I should be back
again in a couple of weeks.
Why'd the old man pick you?
One word. Starbuck.
Is she in hack again?
Not yet.
But apparently, she's been
driving commander Garner...
up one bulkhead and
down the other...
ever since she took
over flight training on...
what'd you call it?
The beast?
And since I won't be flying
combat for a while, I...
Were you going to mention these?
Oh, yeah.
Got promoted to Major.
Well, don't sound so happy!
It doesn't mean much.
I think it means a lot.
Oh, well,...
if you say so,
then it must be true.
What's going on?
We were unloading
one of the containers...
and then one of the
crates shifted.
So,...
we looked inside, and saw
that something was moving.
Did you call it in?
Yeah, we shut door,
and the marines are on their way.
Give me a light.
Chief, we don't know what
we're dealing with here.
Don't you think we should wait?
Just wait out here.
Chief!
Is this the Galactica?
Yeah.
Are you Dr. Cottle?
What the hell was that?
I don't know. We should call it in.
All right. I gonna
spin up the ftl drive just in case.
Pegasus, this is Raptor 718.
Emergency.
Request instructions.
Say again, Shark.
Pegasus...
distress.
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency?
Buster, Shark, do you read?
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency?
Commander Garner on deck.
Buster, Shark, do you read?
What have you got, Mr. Hoshi?
I'm not sure, sir.
I think Buster and Shark
are declaring an emergency,...
but their transmission's garbled.
We've lost them, sir.
49.584 survivors
in search of a home
Called Earth
Welcome aboard, Major.
I didn't expect a welcoming
committee.
Don't flatter yourself.
I was in the neighborhood.
Major Adama, sir.
Major Adama.
Commander Garner.
Glad to see you, Major.
Although I wish it was under
better circumstances.
We have just lost contact
with two of our raptors...
out on a training mission.
What?
When did that happen?
Captain Thrace.
Perhaps if you were actually
down on the flight deck...
and monitoring your raptors...
the way any training officer
worth a damn would have done,...
you would know that four of
our pilots were missing.
Major?
You with me, Major?
Yes, sir.
The disappeared from the dradis
about an hour ago.
They're gone.
Shut the hell up!
We lose two raptors in
a training mission,...
and I only find out when the
commander throws it in my face.
Don't all speak at once.
Sir, it's been made clear...
that discussing flight deck situations
with anyone outside Pegasus crew...
is not allowed.
Sorry, sir.
And whose frakkin'
bright idea was that?
It was Garner,
wasn't it?
Of course it was.
So barely competent and paranoid.
There's a hell of a combination.
I have a problem.
That problem's name is Kara Thrace.
I-I know to handle her, sir.
And for the record,
she is one hell of a viper pilot.
What? I should cut her some slack
because she's good in the cockpit.
Is that what you're saying?
Because nobody ever cut us
any slack in the engine room.
I could tell you that right now.
But then, uh,...
I don't know, maybe being a snipe is
different than being a viper jockey.
No flashy stunts for us.
No flying by the seat of
our pants down there!
The engine room is like
a finely tuned watch,...
and everything in it needs to be
monitored and maintained...
in a very precise fashion.
Nobody freelances.
Everything is done
in the proper way...
at the proper time
in the proper order!
Or there'd be no power.
No lights.
No hot showers for your flyboys.
You know, Major,...
I think some of the people around here...
could learn a thing or
two from the snipes.
I'm sorry, Madame President.
But it's that time.
Campaign meeting.
We've been
putting it off for weeks.
And we do have a Presidential
election coming up...
unless you've
decided not to run.
Yeah, and to be perfectly
honest with you, Tori,...
I've thought about it a few times.
But, um, no, I'm still here.
There's so much to do. So...
let's talk politics.
Great.
Here are the results
from our first fleet-wide poll.
How did you manage this?
I was precinct Captain for the
federalist party...
in delphi for five years.
We did polls to see what the mayor
should have for lunch.
For what it's worth, you've
managed to walk a very fine line.
You're Presidential bid has the
support of both the military...
and the civilian fleet,...
and you've received
enthusiastic endorsements...
from the Gemenese
religious leaders.
Well, it helps when your only real
rival is a convicted terrorist.
Am I capable of
leading this fleet?
Absolutely.
And for a time,...
I almost had a chance.
Until Laura Roslin ascended from...
politician to prophet.
The truth is I can't win.
But you could.
You flatter me, Mr. Zarek. Really.
But I'm not sure I'm cut out
for a life in politics...
as I find the vice presidency and
everything to do with it very tedious.
I would imagine
carrying water for Roslin...
would get old after a time.
But it's the office that makes you
the perfect candidate, doctor.
You're pre-sold.
Really?
To whom?
You'd be surprised how many
people crave the assurances...
of cold science as opposed
to the superstitious...
ravings of the Gemenese.
As a scientist, you offer hope.
Think about it.
And you, Tom.
You'll just step aside...
will you?
I'm just happy to back a man
of true conviction.
A man...
who remembers his friends.
Attention on deck.
At ease.
Where's Stinger?
He's in hack for
mouthing off to Garner.
Stepped on his precious little toes.
Frakking Garner.
He's such an idiot.
All right, lock that up!
Get something straight.
We got two missing raptor crews who are
gonna be out of oxygen in 36 hours.
That's all that matters.
So, everyone knock
off the schoolyard crap...
and start doing your frakkin' jobs.
Now...
we need to start
thinking outside the box.
Which is supposed to be
what you do best.
Sorry, Major.
All right.
I wanna know everything there is to
know about these missing raptors...
and their crews.
I wanna know personal quirks,...
aircraft squawks,...
wireless transmissions,
anything that might help.
Good.
Get to it.
How is she?
Rya's four months pregnant
and doesn't want to be.
I understand the
Gemenese have a problem...
with women terminating
their pregnancies.
Tyrol said that she
asked for you by name.
Do you want to tell me what
that's really all about?
Pretty straight forward, really.
I get a note that a
girl's on the way.
She arrives. I do my work.
And then she leaves.
I don't ask a lot of questions.
You're gonna start.
I wanna talk to her.
I'm Admiral Adama.
Don't worry,
I've just come to talk.
It doesn't matter what you say.
I'm not gonna change my mind.
Your parents are a little
worried about you.
They've contacted me...
through the Gemenon
representative.
My parents.
Gods.
Do you have any idea what
they would do to me?
Please, do not send me back.
You're a stowaway.
Aboard a military ship.
Some people might say she was a
victim of political persecution.
Hell.
She could apply for asylum.
Asylum.
That's it.
I want asylum.
Under Gemenon law, the girl is
still the property of her parents.
And they can deal with her once
she's safely back on her ship.
To be honest,...
I'm more concerned with the broader
implications of this matter.
- Sarah.
- I know you don't want to hear this.
But my people, my voters are
demanding action on this issue.
We have been through this.
Abortion was legal under
colonial law before the attacks,...
and so it is still legal today.
It's obscene.
The scriptures view abortion as an
abomination in the eyes of the gods.
You cannot equivocate
on this point...
if want our support in
the coming election.
Rya Kibby's petition for asylum
is under review.
Thank you, Sarah,
very much for coming in.
I'm not turning that girl over.
I'm certainly not banning abortion.
Then don't.
But we have to move
aggressively on this thing.
I'm arranging a conference call
with you and the quorum.
This is gonna get
out of hand fast.
She's not Billy.
No, she's not.
What?
I hate to say this.
Because I know
that this is a political issue.
The fact is that that number...
doesn't go up very often.
I fought for a woman's right
to control her body...
my entire career.
No. No.
I'm just remembering
what you said.
Right after the cylon attack.
That if we really
want to save the human race,...
we'd better start having babies.
Nothing, nothing, and more nothing.
Where...is shark's
last transmission?
Well...
there's not much there.
"...Eve...distress...bearing...
reek...shuns...emerge-- read."
They were in distress.
They...
give a bearing "requesting
instructions...
it's an emergency... can you read"?
Maybe, but what's this
"eve" fragment here?
Eve...distress.
Eve...distress.
Distress call
Eve. Recei-received?
Received distress call.
Okay. From who?
I don't know.
But maybe that's where
they went. To go find out.
Commander, Captain Thrace has a
theory about our missing raptors,
sir.
That's good
considering she lost them.
Excuse me?
Well, they were out on one of your
so-called training missions.
Weren't they, Captain?
My "so-called" training missions.
Okay, let's just take this easy.
That's when you're not boozing or
sowing mutiny amongst the crew.
Mutiny?
Commander, we should take
this to a private place.
Don't you think I know what's
happening on my own ship?
"Barely competent? And paranoid?"
That was off the record.
I was just venting.
Accurately.
I'll have you court-martialled.
Commander.
I'm not defending
Captain Thrace's behavior.
Thanks, Major.
Captain Thrace,
you're restricted to quarters.
Until I can ship you back
to Galactica.
You're Adama's pet.
Let him deal with you.
Major?
Yes, sir.
You've been on board
less than four days,...
and you're already facing charges.
You don't waste any time, do you?
Neither do you, Lee.
How's it feel
being Garner's new playmate?
I'm here to do a job!
Yeah.
Keep a loudmouth, disobedient
frak of Kara Thrace in line.
Not doing such a
good job, are ya?
Evidently not.
We don't have much time.
Those guys are running out of air.
Yeah, well, I tried. All right?
All I have done since I got to
the beast is try and help,...
and all I've gotten is Garner's
foot in my ass.
Well, maybe you need
a kick in the ass!
All right.
Here we go.
Finally.
What is your problem anyway?
What's my problem?
What's my problem?
Well Kara,
my problem is you.
You keep frakking up, and I keep
having to clean it up,...
and I am officially... sick of it.
Poor Lee, your
life is so hard, isn't it?
You mean, since I got shot.
You wanna hear what I think
happened to Buster, or not?
Pegasus, Red Devil.
I'm nearing the last coordinates
where our raptors went missing.
Repeat...Emergency...
Buster, is that you?
Buster, this is
Red Devil, man.
Is that you, buddy?
Come back to me.
Power failure...
oxygen's almost out...
For love of the gods, help.
Sir!
One of our search raptors just
picked up a possible distress signal...
from near where Pegasus lost
communications with Buster's ship.
Finally.
Possible distress signal.
There's a theory that Buster
himself might have jumped away...
to run down a phony distress
call. It could be a trap.
A theory?
Is this your theory, major?
This is captain Thrace's
theory, is it not?
Mr. Thornton.
Can you give us a fix on where this
distress signal is coming from?
Yes, sir, it's long range,
over 40 SU away.
Then spin up the FTL drive,
and prepare to jump the ship.
Yes, sir.
Sir!
This isn't just Captain
Thrace's theory.
I think this is a cylon trap, and...
And I disagree.
Now get Admiral Adama on the line.
I'm going to get our men.
Admiral, we finally got the
break we've been looking for...
bearing on the distress signal.
I can jump there
inside of two minutes.
Commander, believe me,
I understand how you feel.
But the cylons have been
known to lure ships into traps.
Using fake distressed calls.
Have you considered that?
We have, sir.
It's a scenario
we don't think likely.
We?
Major Adama, do you concur?
Sir...
Captain Thrace and I
are of the opinion...
that the first two raptors...
may very well have been lured
away by just such a trick.
An opinion I do not share, sir.
We'll send a recon
mission in full force.
Five raptors.
Three escort, two rescue.
You have your orders, Commander.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Major.
I'm sure your expertise
is needed elsewhere.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I am curious.
Why the sudden interest in
the fleet's demographic projections?
An issue has emerged that may prove
divisive to our administration.
I would like all the facts in hand
before making my decision.
So, now it's our administration?
She must be desperate.
Well, I'm a very busy man.
Luckily, I made an initial
calculation on these figures...
over seven months ago when nobody
seemed interested or concerned.
All I had to do was factor in
the numbers from the Pegasus crew.
It took me hardly any time at all,
and I didn't mind.
Look, I'll save you the bother,
you needn't read the report.
If we continue on our
present course,...
within the next 18 years,
the human race will simply be...
extinct.
Since assuming the presidency,...
I've made it my mission to
maintain the rights and freedoms...
we so enjoyed prior to the attack.
One of these rights has now
come into direct conflict...
with the survival of the species.
And I find myself forced to make a
very difficult decision.
The issue is stark.
The fact is that if the
civilization is to survive,...
we must, must repopulate
this fleet.
Therefore, I'm issuing
an executive order.
From this day forward,...
anyone seeking to interfere
with a birth of child,...
whether it be the mother...
or a medical practitioner...
shall be subject
to criminal penalty.
Thank you.
All flight deck personnel,
please report to stations.
All right, come on,
let's go, let's go!
Captain Case, what's going on?
We've been ordered to
scramble, condition one.
Ship's getting ready to jump.
We're gonna launch
on the other side.
- Get down to the hangar deck!
- What?
Look.
You're the best
pilot we've got.
So, get down there.
Find a viper.
It's about time you admitted that!
Commander, what's our sitrep?
This is a rescue mission, Major.
- On whose authority?
- Mine.
I'm bringing my pilots home.
With all due respect, sir.
But if this is a cylon trap,...
then we are entering blind!
We should send a force recon...
My pilots are dying
down there, Major!
I'm going in,
I'm not waiting on recon!
Commander, this is in direct
violation of the Admiral's orders.
Major. Leave combat.
Making this an illegal
action on your part, sir!
You are relieved, Major!
Sergeant of the guard.
I am forced to take
command of this vessel!
- This man is in direct disobedience of an order...
 - Under federal regulations...
- I want him under arrest!
- I place you under arrest!
Sergeant.
Take him below.
Sergeant, the commander's
been properly relieved.
Escort him to his quarters.
This man is not
a member of this crew,...
and you will obey a direct order...
that you have been given
by me, and you will do it now.
Major.
You'll come with me.
Admiral!
The Pegasus has jumped.
They're gone.
Dradis signal's clean. Jump put is
clear of any interference.
Sir, I show two raptors.
Transponder codes match.
They're ours.
Mr. Hoshi.
Tell the CAG to
launch our recovery team,...
and let's bring our people home.
Aye, sir.
Pegasus, Red Devil.
Our two birds
look intact.
Can't quite see inside yet.
Commander, we're unable to
raise the raptors on wireless.
Oh, my gods.
Pegasus, both raptor
crews are dead.
I repeat. They're all dead.
Sir, three cylon base ships just
jumped into weapons range.
Oh, my gods.
They're launching nukes!
Brace for impact.
Damage report?
Two...two nuclear
detonations in the stern, sir.
FTL drive inoperative, sir.
We're stuck here, sir.
All right, Showboat. You take red
squadron. Hit 'em on the right.
Catbird, you take green.
Hit 'em on the left.
The rest of you, follow me.
We're going straight up the gut.
Sergeant, I think you have
better things to do.
Oh, then the spinner's fine?
It's gotta be a sensor.
Just pull it.
No, no, listen to me. Listen to me.
Just pull it, pull it!
Nuclear detonation.
We have structural damage
along the topside heat exchanger.
We can't take much more
of this. How long before...
those drives are back up?
I don't know. They don't
seem to understand.
I need to go down there.
You have the con.
Yes, sir.
I have the con.
Make for the nearest base ship.
And roll us over to keep our top
side out of their line of fire.
Hoshi, contact Starbuck in case...
tell them I've
assumed command.
And to concentrate on
protecting our top side.
Aye, sir.
Wilco, Pegasus.
We got your back.
Mr. Gaeta, any contact?
Negative, sir.
Gimme that.
Can I get through there?
Base ship dead ahead,
we're closing rapidly!
We can't keep taking hits
like this, Major.
Helm.
Steady as you go.
Have the bow battery
stand by for a salvo fire.
Target their center axis.
Yes, sir.
See if we can't cut down the odds.
We need those FTLs fixed soon.
Or we're dead.
Twenty-two hundred.
Main battery has a firing solution.
And fire.
Coolant pressure's off-scale low.
Primary inlet's choked.
Pressure's dropping. We gotta hull
breach in there somewhere.
Well, we gotta get in there,
and open the auxiliary valve!
We can't do that, sir!
We have to!
Sir, that breach can vent all
our oxygen into space.
We don't have a choice.
Now, open the hatch.
Breathing gear?
We used it all up
fighting the fires, sir.
Give me sledge and a number
12 spanner.
All right.
Now close this hatch behind me.
We're losing air,...
close the gods damn hatch.
Close it!
Base ship's turning away.
He's--he's frakkin' running, Major!
But the other two aren't.
They're coming hard.
Helm...
left, full.
I'm at the manifold.
I'm gonna see
if I can turn them.
Yes!
There's definitely air escaping.
Through a crack, over the SVC relay.
The breach is behind that.
Starbuck reports
vipers are skosh ammo, Major.
We're down to throwing
rocks at the bastards.
We gotta haul ass
outta here now, sir!
Sir!
Come on, Garner.
O2's in the red, skipper.
You're almost out of air.
You got it! The pressure's
coming back up.
Now get the frak outta there,
come on!
You're air is gone, skipper!
Get outta  there!
Skipper?
Engineering's reporting a green
board. FTL drive online and ready.
Okay, commence jump prep.
Bring our birds home.
Pegasus, Starbuck.
Nobody behind me
but toasters.
Now get us outta here!
Air wing's back on board.
Landing bays secure.
Jump!
You give Garner a lot of credit.
Well, it's all true.
He gave his life to save the ship.
Starbuck's report wasn't so kind.
Well, she had her perspective.
And I had mine.
In your opinion,...
off the record...
what was Garner's flaw?
He was used to
working with machines.
Command is about people.
Remember that.
I want you to take
command... of the beast.
Garner was my decision.
His failure's my responsibility.
Don't let me fail a second time.
Congratulations, Commander.
Madame President?
Word has it that you do not intend...
to prosecute the
Gemenese girl on Galactica.
She has a name, Sarah.
I think that Rya has
suffered enough.
She's just been
through an abortion.
I've granted her asylum
aboard Galactica.
This is in total
violation of the law.
My order came after she sought her
procedure. No laws have been broken.
The girl belongs at home,
with her parents. I insist.
You have your pound of flesh.
And I suggest you take your
victory, and you move on.
Ma'am?
You realize you're screwed, right?
All the pressure, the responsibility,
the sleepless nights,...
all the officers
giving you a hard time.
Yeah, well, it could be worse.
You could be my CAG.
I'm gonna stay
here and be Galactica's CAG.
Something about wanting
to keep an eye on me.
Well,...
you and Colonel Tigh have a lot of
fun at those early morning briefings.
'Cause the XO's
a lot of fun first thing.
Great.
Congratulations.
Really.
Congratulations.
You deserve it.
I know why I
was mad at you, Kara.
A simple thank you would
have been sufficient.
'Cause you were doing
what you always did.
Buck authority,
and get away with it.
I bucked authority once.
And I almost lost everything.
So I guess when
I showed up on Pegasus,...
and there you were doing it
all over again...
I don't know.
Pissed me off.
Doesn't make a lot
of sense, does it?
You should hear the
way my brain works sometimes.
Are we okay?
You have a brain?
Madame President,
your decision to...
criminalize abortion
has created a furor.
Do you think that's hurt your
standing in the polls?
Absolutely.
If I may, Madame President.
It is true in the light
of recent events,...
the President may have lost
support in some quarters.
I  would ask the people
to understand that...
if this is an extreme decision,...
we live in extreme times.
The decision has been
made with good faith.
I, however, cannot with good
conscience support it.
I am so sorry, Madame President.
But the cylon have no understanding
of the meaning of the word freedom.
How could they?
They're programmed.
Machines.
Every time you take
away one of our freedoms,...
every time you restrict or
curtail one of our rights,...
we become one step
closer to being like them.
As the vice-president,...
I am bound to follow
the administration's lead.
As president...
I should have no such strictures.
Given the current situation,...
I'm afraid that I have no alternative...
but to announce
that I am, as of now,...
a candidate for the presidency.
Are you you resigning
the vice presidency?
Are you a one-issue candidate?
Are you being disloyal
to the President?

We've been fighting cylons.
Hitting 'em as we can.
*Coudn't understand it, sorry.*
Rebuilding Caprica
First Sharon was a sleeper agent.
Didn't realize she was a cylon.
Until a program in kick vision.
I'm Sharon, but I'm a different Sharon.
And I'm here to help.
No, I've decided you're an expression of my, uh...
subconscious mind playing itself out during my waking states.
So I'm only in your head?
I'm pregnant, Helo.
We can have a child.
Sharon is going to bear our child?
An honor for which she is hardly deserving
but one doesn't question God's will.
Cylons reincarnate.
Makes sense, doesn't it?
All of memories are downloaded
into a brand new body
Death then becomes a
learning experience.
Nine Months Ago
Caprica
Wait, there has to be another way out of here! I
mean.. I mean you.. you must have an escape plan.
You're not about to be destroyed by your
own bombs, are you? How are you leaving?
Oh!
Gaius, I can't die.
When this body's destroyed, my memory, my
consciousness will be transmitted to a new oŁne.
I'll just wake up somewhere
else in an identical body.
You mean there's more
out there like you?
There are 12 models.
I'm number 6.
- I don't want to die.
- Get down.
Do you love me?
Where.. where..
I was in a house.
But you're not in a house any longer.
You're back with us.
You've been reborn.
I died.
I died.
hat's right. You were in
a house.  It was destroyed.
A nuclear blast.
But that is all over now. You have
been downloaded into a new body.
Gaius?
Gaius was in the house.
Gaius Baltar.
Yes. Is he alive?
Is he?
Shhhhhh.
I'm not really here.
No one can see me but you.
Don't let them know.
Six.
Would it trouble you if
doctor Baltar were dead?
If they know how you feel
about me, it'll be a problem.
It would be unfortunate..
..  if he died.
He was so helpful.
Very helpful.
Your mission was a resounding success.
It completely disabled
the colonial defenses.
he attack succeeded beyond our most
optimistic projections, thanks to you.
Ten Weeks Ago
Battlestar Galactica
You're a machine, I'm not.
I know there's pain, but
breathe.. ride through it.
You're going to be okay.
Trust me.
You're in god's hands.
We're all here with you.
That's it.
This will pass. Trust me.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Welcome home, sister.
We're here.
We're going to take care of you.
We're proud of you, Sharon.
And we love you.

I was thinking it symbolized
rebirth, a new beginning.
It's a memorial.
Do you know how many people died
in this park during the attack?
How many people in this park alone?
It's gonna be lovely, isn't it?
Sorry.
A place to relax and
collect your thoughts.
How are you doing?
I'm a little stiff.
I'm still trying to
get used to this body.
I mean, I know it's identical, but...
...  even after all this
time, I still feel awkward.
I was a klutz too.
Always knock things over.
Forever tripping over things.
And, you know what? You get over it.
And you know what, this is
a great chance to cleanse.
You got a new body, a new life.
And anything that you've built up
like anxieties or remorse or guilt..
... just let it wash away.
I can't tell you how thankful I am.
You've.. you've been a
really big help to me.
No, it's me who's thankful.
We all are.
You are a warrior. We could
not have won without you.
Excuse me.
I just wanted to say it's an honor
to have you here on Caprica with us.
What you did..
.. well, it's inspiring.
Thank you.
Present Day Battlestar Galactica
Hey. How you doing?
Freezing.
I can't feel my legs.
That's the epidural.
What happened?
You passed out and started bleeding again,
but everything's going to be all right.
Like hell it is.
I find it absolutely amazing. You people went to all the
trouble to appear human and didn't upgrade the plumbing.
You have a detached placenta.
Baby's gotta come out now
or we will lose you both.
Okay, sir, I'm going to have
to ask you to step back, please.
She's tachycardiac, and her
blood pressure's dropping.
Yeah, she's hemorrhaging again.
We're gonna have to make the cut now.
Sharon? can you hear me?
Helo.
Still can't get used to this.
Well, you're a hero of the cylon now.
You're our first celebrity.
No, I'm just another Six.
You're too modest. I'm just another
Three. And there are Fives and.. or Eights.
But you, everyone
calls you Caprica Six ..
..like you're the
only Six on the planet.
And.. and what you did
was incredibly difficult.
Seduce a man, so emotionally and
physically so that he grants you access to..
... all the most closely
guarded secrets of his people.
That mission could be
profoundly disturbing.
Disturbing?
She sleeping with me and
killing billions of people?
'Cause I rather thought you
enjoyed sleeping with me.
It was difficult at times.
So nobody here can possibly understand what you've
been through. Which is why we need your help.
There's another cylon who's been having
trouble re-integrating after a download.
Another hero, actually.
An Eight.
-  She still insists on calling herself Sharon.
- And you thought I could help.
I'm still having... I'm
having problems of my own.
Caprica, you don't understand.
She really needs your help.
If we don't turn her around
soon, there's talk of boxing her.
Putting her memories in cold
storage? You can't be serious.
Well, that's a charming way to
deal with emotional problems.
One might almost call it inhuman.
Oh, that's right, you are.
All right, look, it is a last
resort, but she has been regressing.
Please.
She's living up there in that apartment. It's
the one she had when she thought she was human.
Security's minimal.
Two centurions patrol out front.
The third bullet-head
watch the perimeter.
Bullet-head walking perimeter
makes random changes to his patrol.
Be tough to get past him.
All right, so we go under him.
The storm drain leads directly
to the garage underneath the cafe.
They'll be dozens of skin jobs inside.
She's not breathing.
Suction it.
What's going on? Where
are you taking her?
Her lungs aren't fully developed.
She needs oxygen support.
But she's alive, right?
Right?
There's your answer.
Now you get the hell out of here. We have to
stop the mother bleeding or she won't be alive.
You here to kick me out?
No.
You're here to help me
with my adjustment problems.
I could save you some time.
This is home.
I'm not leaving.
I lived oŁn caprica for two years.
I knew what I was.
Pretended to be human, but I knew.
If you knew what you were and you lived
on Caprica, you know what that makes you.
A really good liar.
Start with the elephants.
These are beautiful.
Ithacan?
Hand-carved.
My mother gave them to me the
day I left for the fleet academy.
Is this her?
Supposed to be.
'Course none of it's real.
All fabricated for my mission.
It's all a lie.
Following god's path is never easy.
Don't get religious with this one.
Do you think I care, about your god?
Look, god loves you.
This is love.
These people love me.
I love them.
I didn't pretend to feel something
so I could screw people over.
I loved them.
And then I betrayed them.
I shot a man I loved.
Frakked over another man,
ruined his life. And why?
Because i'm a lying machine.
I'm a frakking Cylon!
Sorry.
I didn't mean to...
I've got bandages in there.
Nicely done.
You timed it perfectly.
Scratch your face with the side of your
fingernail the moment the glass hits the wall.
Never saw a cylon show fear before.
Especially the Sixes.
Usually so hardcore.
Feign fear and emotional
vulnerability.. you're very good.
But I'm better.
Let me help you.
"I'm different."
I'm different.
"I'm more like you."
I'm more like you.
"I had someone I met here."
I had someone I met here.
"A Man." A Man.
"I loved him and I think he could've loved me eventually."
I loved him and I think he could've loved me eventually.
Half a cigarette should give us two or
three minutes to get the frak out of there.
Any longer and we risk them finding
the charges before they go off.
Is it two minutes or three?
About to find out.
This is a risky operation just
to nail a couple dozen skin jobs.
I mean, we can't kill them.
They'll just download
into a new body and...
I mean, what's the point?
That skin job with Starbuck..
"Sharon".. they called her..
... she said that when they
download, they remembered everything.
Right up until the end.
These skin jobs are going to remember
being blown into tiny little pieces.
- It's gotta hurt.
- Yeah.
I hope it hurts a lot.
Because sooner or later, the message sinks
in. There is no safe place, not even a cafe.
So if you want to quit living through hell and dying
over and over again, then get the frak off our planet.
Three minutes, ten seconds
Bum.
This house was on a bluff over a lake.
I always loved the view.
Sunlight on the water.
It's my favorite spot in the universe.
Yeah, it's magical.
Too bad you nuked it.
After I downloaded, I went
back to the ruins of his house.
Why?
Like you, I was looking for
some sort of connection to him.
Found a few of his things. Even
held onto them for awhile. But..
...  I realized they were keeping
me from truly embracing my new life.
So what you did with them?
I burned them.
But I felt liberated.
Yeah, it's a beautiful story, isn't it?
Shame it's all a pack of lies.
So who was he? This man you loved.
Maybe you've heard of him.
Gaius Baltar.
Doctor Baltar?
Yeah.
He gave you access to
the colonial defense grid.
He was the one who betrayed us?
"Us".. Oh, I love it.
This one thinks she's
more human than Cylon.
Just like someone else I know.
Does he still work for the cylons?
What?
On Galactica?
He's..
.. He's alive?
He's the vice-president
of the colonies.
You didn't know that?
If her baby does survive, the
question is what do we do with it?
Do?
What are you suggesting?
That we throw it out of an air lock?
I don't make suggestions, Mr. Baltar. If I
want to toss a baby out an air lock, I'd say so.
Well, it's really gratifying to know
that infanticide's not on the table.
Do I have to point out
that this is not a baby?
It's a machine.
No, it's half machine, half human.
I suggest we all keep that half in mind.
Cylons went through a great deal
of trouble to create this thing.
Should go without saying that if it's
good for them, it's gonna be bad for us.
I completely agree.
And I take it as a given we can't turn it over
to Sharon to raise. That would be disastrous.
There's still another
factor to consider here.
There's cylons aboard this fleet.
If they find out this
thing's been born..
... they're gonna make a play for it.
You can see where this is headed, Gaius.
We're going to have to take our child.
Hello, Hera.
She's got quite a grip on her.
You don't like it in
there, do you, Hera?
You gotta stay in till
your lungs get stronger.
She's our little girl.
We made her.
It almost makes you want
to believe in the Cylon God.
Almost.
I love you so completely.
It's clear.
Hilliard, take this.
Let's move.
Here you go.
Why do you think they kept it from you?
Is the wrong question.
The right question is why did she get me to work
with you knowing that you'd tell me the truth?
She knew I had feelings for Gaius.
Knew that I had trouble
letting go of him.
She must've known it would trigger
those feelings and those memories.
- She's frakking with you. Can't you see that?
- But why?
Oh, it's so perfectly obvious.
You know, for a self-aware cybernetic life-form,
sometimes you can be unbearably obtuse.
- Oh for god sake.
- Careful.
Everything okay?
Fine.
Just talking with Sharon here.
Yeah? What about?
She...
... asked me to move out.
You know what? Which is what
we've been asking her for weeks.
I was kind of hoping that you'd see the
light after talking to our friend here.
She is lying, unfortunately.
She has no wish to see Sharon cured.
They're just going to do it.
They're going to box her.
How many Cylons up in the cafe?
Full house. At least 40.
Three minutes, ten seconds.
We've just made a breakthrough.
She's agreed to move
out of her apartment.
Didn't you, Sharon?
Yeah.
I'm moving out of the apartment.
When?
Whenever.
What about now?
I'll help. The apartment
is right upstairs.
Sure.
Let me.. Let me just get some things.
- Good work Six, must've been some chat, huh?
- Yes, we had a lot to talk about.
- She's right behind you.
- I know.
This is not a debate.
This child will not be raised by the cylon, and I cannot risk
cylon agents getting their hands on it. I've made my decision.
What I need from you,
Doctor, is your help.
Fine. I don't like it,
but have it your way.
- I need it immediately.
- We'll have to find somebody suitable.
I'll have to work up a list of names.
Each of them is capable.
Each of them is anonymous.
And each can be trusted.
Thought of everything, haven't you?
I hope so.
Are you all right, Sharon?
What happened?
An explosion.
Building came down on us.
Looks like the stairwell saved us.
Where's Six?
Her body's dead.
No, not yet.
Help me out here.
Would've been better if the
explosion had killed her.
There's nothing we can do about the
pain until we get her out of here.
Six
I can get a cross beam and
put you out of your misery.
I'm not going to get my own life again.
It's your choice.
Where the heck are we anyway?
Must be in the garage.
North entrance must be that way.
I'm start digging.
Hang in there.
You're gonna be okay.
A survivor.
Hang on, buddy.
We'll get you out.
Fresh air coming from down there.
Thanks. I'd almost gone there.
Frakkin' human. You know he
probably set that explosion.
What, from the resistance? Why?
No military value to the cafe.
- But humans don't respect life the way we do.
- No!
I  won't let you kill him.
She's right.
- Don't kill him.
- Why not?
Why not kill him?
You've already killed
billions of people.
Do you honestly believe one more body's going
to weigh any heavier on your conscience..
which is something that you don't have..
Do you?
We should interrogate him.
Find his accomplices.
Okay.
You can let go now, Sharon.
What's this?
Looks like colonial fleet ID.
Thrace, Kara.
Starbuck?
She was oŁn caprica
a couple of weeks ago.
She escaped with the
help of another Sharon.
If she gave him this, he
meant something to her.
Well, then it's sweet.
You have it in your hand.
Hard physical proof of one
person's love for another.
If only you felt this deeply about us.
I did.
I do.
I love you, Gaius.
Where's the tangible proof?
I don't understand.
She was doing so well.
No, she wasn't.
I tried to tell you that.
Her lungs never fully developed.
She finally went into respiratory  distress.
We couldn't get her intubated in time.
We lost her.
I'm sorry.
I should've been here.
Sharon.
Listen. You've lost a lot of blood.
You murdered her.
Sharon. Come on.
Who ordered it?
Adama? The President?
Who?
I don't kill patients.
We did the best we could..
.. but she's dead.
And that's all there is to it.
I should be able to release
the ashes to you in a few hours.
Murderer.
- Sharon!
- Die!
You're all murderers!
You're all murderers!
Get her out of here.
Give me my baby back!
You let them murder our child.
I am so sorry.
I tried.
I tried my best.
God's will was that our
child should survive.
His will was that she would lead the
next generation of god's children.
His will was that you would protect her.
Yes.
You have committed a monstrous and unforgivable sin and now you
and your entire wretched race are going to suffer god's vengeance.
She's so beautiful.
I don't know how to thank you.
When I lost my baby, I
didn't know how I could go on.
Well, I'm glad things worked
out for you and this little girl.
I can't believe somebody would
give up this little angel.
You understand, Maya, that this
adoption requires absolute secrecy.
The mother is a pegasus officer and must remain
anonymous for political and religious reasons.
You have my word.
Maya, you won't mind if
I drop in occasionally.
Oh, of course not.
Good.
Go.
Thank you.
I know how awful this was for you.
But trust me, it was imperative.
As far as the cylons know, this child no
longer exists. That is a good, good thing.
Is this what you're looking for?
You can have it.
Here.
What are you doing?
Just making it easy for
him to get what he wants.
Come on. I'll give you a head start.
I'm fine where I am.
Hey, they're coming for us.
And you.
They're very interested
in you, aren't they?
Leave him alone.
Sharon.
You're a hero of the cylon.
Now you're just a broken
machine who thinks she's a human.
But you're not a human, Sharon..
.. and you never will be.
Yeah, well at least I'm not a murderer.
I have a conscience.
And I know the difference
between right and wrong.
A murderer is exactly what you are.
Life is short.
But the next one's not.
Let your heart adrift and
your soul will get caught.
I love you, Gaius.
My heart and soul are yours.
They're nearly here.
You know why they wanted
you to work with Sharon?
So you'd lose your mind.
They're gonna box you, darling.
Just like they're going to box Sharon.
We're dangerous.
What?
Sharon and I.
We're celebrities in a
culture based on unity.
No.
Our voices count.
More than hers.
More than others'.
We're two heroes of the cylon, right?
Two heroes with different
perspectives on the war.
Perspectives based by our
love of two human beings.
That's why she wanted me to work with you so
that you'd tell me that Gaius was still alive.
She wanted me to lose my mind.
No, you're corrupted
by your experiences.
You're a waste.
Believe the lies.
Ignore the truth. Listen to
me. I will show you the proof.
Speak from your heart.
Say the things that you know to be true.
Jealously, murder, vengeance..
they're all sins in the eyes of god.
That's what you and I know.
That's what they don't want to hear.
Because then they'd have to
rethink what they're doing.
They'd have to consider that maybe
the slaughter of mankind was a mistake!
God loves me.
See you again soon.
Looks like they're almost here.
You should get out
of here while you can.
The fresh air coming
in should lead you out.
Is this some kind of trick?
You can stay and be
tortured if you want.
Your call.
Who are you?
What kind of people are you?
I don't know.
Hey, wait!
How long till she downloads
and tells them what happened?
We had a lot of people in the cafe.
At least 36 hours till they get to her.
Long enough.
Long enough for what?
To change things for the better.
What are you talking about?
I have never..
...  loved anyone more in my life ...
.. than I love you now.
Our people need a new beginning.
A new way to live in God's love.
Without hate.
Without all the lies.
All they need is for
someone to show them the way.
Someone like two heroes of the cylons.
I'm with you.
We found them!
They're alive!
Yes, we are.
We're alive.
The Cylons Were
Created by Man
They Evolved
They Rebelled
There Are Many Copies
And They Have A Plan
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica...
The raiders are going to send a
signal to activate the virus.
On my mark,
initiate the computer wipe.
I'm connecting through the network now
Congratulations, commander
I'm leaving Galactica...
not you.
I'm coming back.
I said it,...
I meant it.
I understand what is like...
to lose someone that
you care about deeply
They're not lost,...
not yet.
We have to go back to Caprica.
Given the current situation,...
I'm afraid that I have no alternative...
but to announce
that I am, as of now,...
a candidate for theĀpresidency.
I'm going to lose.
Yes, come in, please.
One minute, Madam President.
Thank you, Tory.
No one should be under any illusions
about what we're going to face here.
Our final jump will take us
intra-atmospher...
less than two klicks
above the surface.
We're also expecting
to take heavy fire.
Simulations indicate losses
of up to 20% can be expected.
That's why this mission
has been designated...
as 2-alpha by the command authority.
It's volunteer only.
You want out,...
now's the time.
I know it's hard to believe
right now, but if you have faith,...
everything will
turn out exactly as it should.
I don't like to lose.
Have faith.
I am about to face
public humiliation.
And you are singing
the same old song.
I'm a little tired of the melody.
Sorry about the mess. It's, um...
bit of a ritual...superstition, really.
I used to do this before
testifying at committee hearings.
This is what I do.
I take one,...
memorize a talking
point, then...
tear the card,...
and let the pieces fall
as they may. It helps.
Yeah, my father used to break
pencils before he went into court,...
then borrow one from the clerk.
Break preconceptions,
work with what you have.
You know, I like that.
Let me see.
I like it.
It's good.
Feel better?
Yeah.
But what happens if the, uh,...
moderator doesn't
have a pencil?
Then you're pretty screwed.
Oh, no.
I used to...
get the giggles before
debating in high school.
Oh, yes.
It's time, Madam President.
Thank you, Tory.
What many of you don't know is
that the captured cylon heavy raider
is capable of much longer
jumps than our raptors.
In fact, we realized early on...
that if we could install a
heavy raider navigational system...
aboard one of our raptors,...
a strike team could make the
entire trip back to Caprica...
in less than ten jumps.
Now, the limiting factor up until
now has been our inability...
in install the cylon computer
with our computer.
That obstacle has
now been overcome.
She's here to help us.
She's gonna lay out
our navigational markers...
and update our jump coordinates. Does
anyone have a problem with that?
You've been chosen to
lead these people...
by almighty god.
It will happen.
Like the baby happened?
The one I was
destined to protect?
Don't let your anger drive
you into blasphemy, Gaius.
The election's still
two weeks away.
Get your act together.
You ready?
Yeah, I was just
taking a little nap.
Chief.
This is our mission.
It's our duty to the
people we left behind.
And if we need to use a cylon to
get them back, then so be it.
This is about trying to get as many
survivors off Caprica as we can.
Even so, it's still 2-alpha.
Anyone want to eject?
Commander on deck.
Don't worry.
I won't be long.
I want to hear it too.
You just have to really try to think
about something serious.
That always helps.
- Right?
- Like what?
Well, like, uh...
Great.
No one has ever attempted...
a rescue mission
from this distance,...
much less behind enemy lines.
You'll be making history
just by making the attempt.
But bring these people
back from Caprica...
and you'll be making
part of the future.
Questions.
If you guys find Earth
before we get back,...
will you save us a few seats?
Earth? Hell, if we find any rock
with food and water,...
I'll build you guys a bar.
All right.
See, I told you
I wouldn't be long.
Mr. Gaeta, turn on the wireless.
Let's give these people a
chance to hear what kind of fun...
they'll be missing
for the next five days.
We are just minutes
from the start of the first...
presidential debate
between President...
- You okay?
- Laura Roslin and her oppenent...
Vice President Gaius Baltar...
Can I go now?
Coporal Masters
submitted by members of
the civilian fleet...
covering a wide range of topics.
So please stay tuned as we
get set for the first of two...
presidential debates.
The atmosphere in the
auditorium is tense...
as we await the arival of the
two candidates and their aides.
The real pressure will be on
vice-president Baltar tonight.
Chief.
Here comes Vice President...
Gaius Baltar into the room,...
uh, as we, uh, we
await Madam President.
Laura Roslin is very much
ahead in the polls at this point.
We believe that, uh...
she's entering the room shortly,...
but still...still,
of course, waiting for her.
blindsighted her by announcing
his candidacy a month ago.
Dr. Baltar of course is
one of the most admired...
and brilliant scientistific
minds of our generation...
and played a critical
role in saving the human race...
from the cylon threat.
Yes, here comes
the President now.
Laura Roslin, the President,
has entered the room.
I'm going to wipe the floor
with you, Gaius.
You must be losing
your mind again.
If that's the best you
can come up with,...
you're in a lot of trouble.
Good luck.
How you doing?
You okay?
Sharon.
Don't shut me out.
Not now.
Something dark
is coming, Helo.
I can feel it.
I can feel it
lurking out there,...
waiting.
What do you mean?
Back on Caprica?
No.
Not on the mission.
Not any specific thing.
It's more like a dark time.
Chief.
Chief...
Help!
49.579 survivors
in search of a home
Called Earth
Chief Tyrol,...
I am Brother Cavill.
I understand you've
asked for religious counseling.
I never really believed
in psych therapy.
My father was a priest.
I see.
You thought you'd have an easier
time with a priest than a real doctor.
Okay.
I pray to gods...
every night.
But I don't think
they listen to me.
Do you know how
useless prayer is?
Chanting and singing and...
mucking about with old
half-remembered lines of bad poetry.
And you know
what it gets you?
Exactly nothing.
Are you sure you're a priest?
I've been preaching longer than
you've been sucking down oxygen.
And in that time, I've learned
enough to know that the gods...
don't answer prayers.
We're here on our own.
That's the way they set things up.
We have to find our own answers,
our own way out of the wilderness...
without a nice
little sunny path...
all laid out in front
of us in advance.
That's what I'm trying to do.
I'm trying to find my way.
Well, it's not going to get better
until you see what the problem is.
And the problem is,...
you're screwed up,...
heart and mind.
You. Not the...not the gods or
fate or the universe.
You.
Thanks for the pep talk.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Um...
I just wanted to say, um...
well...
good hunting.
Thank you, sir.
Yeah, it's a good plan.
It's a good plan.
Sharon should be able to jump you...
into the atmosphere a couple of...
klicks above the surface.
Down below the...
cylon dradis. I know the
plan, Lee. I wrote it.
I-I gotta go.
I hope you find him, Kara.
I really do.
So do I.
From the Colonial Dispatch.
"Last night's debate only
solidified the perception..."
- I'll do that later.
- "That doctor baltar, for all his charm,..."
"is essentially an empty suit..."
"when it comes to matters of
substantial policy."
It's nice to see the press is
getting it right for a change.
Don't forget, the radical religious
charge is dangerous.
It may be a low blow
from a desperate man, but...
it's the only issue he's
managed to get any traction on.
He will keep exploiting it.
He's gotta come up with something
much, much bigger than that.
If he wants to make it the central
issue of his campaign,...
it's not going to work.
You gotta keep hitting her on
the religious thing.
Every time we go there,...
you score points and we
move the polls in our direction.
I'm not sure if
you're aware, Tom,...
but the mob isn't usually in
the habit of electing...
ungodly apostates who
denigrate people of faith.
Things are going to turn around.
You'll see.
He's right.
Listen to him.
Of course.
Of course, how blind i'm being.
Thank you. Yes.
Things are going to turn around,
you'll see. What is that, advice?
Well, thank you.
Thank for your keen insight,...
your astounding political acumen.
You know, I'm so
assured right now, Tom,...
I'm just going to sit right back
and wait for the hand of god...
to reach down and change
my political fortunes.
How about that?
Galactica, Starbuck.
SAR squadron
confirms readiness check.
And we are spun up out here and
ready for the first jump.
You are go for the jump, Starbuck.
Roger that.
Jump in ten minutes. Mark.
Galactica,
I'd like to speak with actual.
Sir.
Actual. Go.
Did I ever say "thank you"?
No.
Then again, that would be
a first, wouldn't it?
Thank you.
Just come back
in one piece.
That'll be thank you enough.
Good hunting.
Actual out.
SAR team, Starbuck. Set navcon
inputs to coordinate recheck.
Standby for bounce
back and stabilization routines.
Let's do a final check, people.
I still can't believe you
talked me into this.
It's important.
And I'll be with
you there and back.
It's you and me from
now on, no matter what.
Just like we agreed.
I know. I know.
I really appreciate it,
Helo, I really do.
I just can't get her
out of my head.
Our little girl.
Is there a problem?
Racetrack, check.
Callon Chedk.
Wireless check complete.
Board is green and we are set.
Sharon, you're on.
Ready.
SAR team, Starbuck.
Standby to jump on my mark.
Five...
Here we go.
Four, three, two, one.
Commence the first jump.
This doesn't look right.
No other contacts on dradis.
What?
Oh, man. We're at the wrong
jump coordinates.
Frak.
Helo, we've lost
someone already.
It's Racetrack.
So do we go back?
Mission rules say we keep going
unless we lose three.
So we keep going.
Racetrack will just
have to find her way back to base.
It's a hell of a way to start, though.
Let's, uh, let's talk
about what happened.
I can't really believe it.
Cally.
I-I-I don't understand how I
could do that to Cally.
It's like it's a nightmare.
She said you were asleep
when she found you.
Were you having a nightmare
when she woke you up?
I don't remember.
Oh.
Been having any recurring
dreams lately?
No.
Okay.
That's what we in the pray
trade call a lie.
And lies aren't going to
get you anywhere, my friend.
So skip over the
denials and the deceptions...
and let's get right
down to it, shall we?
You're having dreams.
What are they?
Tell me about
your dream, Chief.
Every night...every night,
it's the same.
For how long?
Couple weeks.
And you were having the same dream
when Cally woke you up, weren't you?
I don't know.
I don't remember. Maybe.
It doesn't matter, does it?
All I remember is Cally on
the ground and the blood.
She stopped you.
By waking you up,
she prevented you from carrying out
your secret desire to kill yourself.
I don't have a secret
desire to kill myself.
Well, actually, you're right.
It's not a secret.
You obviously want to kill yourself.
Question is why.
I think there was some kind of
glitch in the navcon firmware.
Hey bottom line, we're to hell and gone...
from where we're
supposed to be, skipper.
Okay, um, any chance that we
can still catch up with them?
Not a chance.
Mission rules say we head back.
Frak me! It was the first jump!
Hey, look, you gave me
these coordinates.
Back to the barn.
Hey.
I am picking up a large
planetary body.
It's frakkin' close.
Where'd that come from?
Hell if I know.
So much dradis interference here,
it didn't even register.
Hey, check this out.
Atmosphere is nitrogen/oxygen.
Organic molecular spectra.
Fresh water?
Hey, you know what this is?
It's habitable.
We may have just found a world
that can support human life.
Maybe we're not just a bunch
of frak-ups after all.
Climate readings overall are within
human norms.
There's some extremes at the
poles that we couldn't withstand...
but that's not unusual.
Well done.
Thank you, sir.
We got a mottled area here at
the river mouth.
So it's probably a delta.
And the chances are, we've got
significant plant and animal life.
So I want a lot of nice,
low passes across here.
Heard the Pegasus survey
mission found wildlife.
Fruit trees.
Rivers of milk and honey.
Yeah. You forgot the lakes of ambrosia.
Most of the planet's
actually pretty barren.
Plant and animal
life located in a...
temperate belt around the equator.
But the best part is...
with all the dradis
interference from the nebula...
the cylons will
probably never find it.
Who cares about
this stupid planet anyway?
Song and dance over nothing.
Less than 20% of that place actually
supports human life so...
You're not seeing the big picture.
This is your new home.
The place where you will
lead a new life.
This is the future, Gaius.
Now there's a
difference in thought.
What's that?
Oh, nothing, Tom.
Just, uh...
can you imagine if we actually had
to live on that thing.
You...
are a genius.
And?
Pay attention.
You're about to win the election.
I'm sorry.
What were you saying, Tom?
We needed an issue.
Something to set us
apart from Roslin.
Something to put her clearly on
the wrong side of a major issue...
that people care
passionately about.
This is it.
Permanent settlement on this planet.
Permanent settlement here.
Have you lost your marbles?
It may look dreary,
it may be dreary,...
but it's solid ground under your
feet and a real sky over your head.
You'd be surprised what a
powerful idea that is to...
people cooped up in metal
boxes for nine months.
You should listen to him, Gaius.
He's a smart, sexy
man, just like you.
Oh, give up.
What?
Give up on Earth.
Yes.
So we'd settle here.
Yes.
You know, it's starting to look like a
lovely little planet after all.
This is a rest stop.
A place to load up
on food and water.
We're not settling
here, obviously.
You've heard the
captain's reports.
Every ship in the fleet has
people begging, pleading,...
demanding they get time
down on the surface.
Even if it's only for a few hours.
Well, a few hours is one thing.
But permanent settlement's
quite another.
Suddenly Baltar's holding out
hope for breathing real air,...
growing real food, sleeping in
a bed instead of a bunk.
Living in a house
instead of a ship.
It's a fantasy.
Look at the mission reports.
All the data indicate that
life on this planet would be hard.
It would be a struggle to even eke a
living out for a few years.
Today's polls show that he's...
also making headway
with the idea that...
because the planet is
hidden in a nebula,...
it will provide a refuge
from the cylons.
What, are we
now assuming that...
cylon technology is not sufficient
enough to find this planet?
We just found it.
Madam President, in my opinion,
people vote their hopes,...
not their fears.
Baltar is offering them what
they want to hear,...
and you're offering
them a bitter reality.
I'm offering them the truth.
They don't want to hear the truth.
They're tried, exhausted.
The idea of stopping,...
laying down their burdens,...
and starting a new
life right now...
is what is resonating
with the voters.
How well is it resonating?
It could turn the entire
election around.
Why are you running?
I'm not.
How long are you
going to do this?
How long are you going to
refuse to see what's...
right in front of your face?
Forget it.
I'm done.
What, you're... you're leaving?
That's right. I'm done.
I'm done dancing
around the truth with you.
You know what's going on.
But you can't or
you won't face it,...
so...
I'm not a therapist.
I'm not going to hold your
hand and help you along.
I'm just trying to get you right
with yourself and with your gods,...
but you're not willing to do it.
I don't even know what
you're talking about.
Oh for gods' sake, chief!
Come on!
You think you're a Cylon.
I am not a Cylon.
Well, of course you're not.
But that's what you're
afraid of, isn't it?
That you might be a cylon
and not even know it just...
just like Boomer, right?
Right?
That's the thought
that's torturing your dreams...
and crippling your soul.
I'm a cylon,...
just like Sharon,
and I deserve to die.
Sharon didn't know...
what she was.
She just kept...
thinking... feeling...
that she was going to
do this terrible thing.
But she knew that she had to
stop herself before she did.
And you think that's what you're
going to do. Some terrible thing.
Well, the truth is, you might.
But not because you're a Cylon.
Because you're a human being,...
and human beings do terrible
things all the time.
But how do you
know I'm human?
Oh, well, maybe because
I'm a Cylon,...
and I've never seen you at
any of the meetings.
There's not much more
I can do for you.
You're going to have
to go back to work...
and try and leave all
of this behind you.
No. I...
I can't.
I can't go back and face
the deck people again.
And Cally?
Well, you'd better.
That's the only family you've got.
Just know that that's your
family and that they love you.
Even Cally.
Especially Cally.
If you doubt your humanity...
and your essential nature
as a human being,...
all you need to do
is look to them...
for the salvation you've been
seeking from the gods.
The gods lift up those...
who lift each other, Chief.
SAR team, Starbuck.
We are set here.
Stand by for final jump to Caprica.
Remember, we are going
very low to the surface.
Be prepared for wind shear,
rain, storms...
anything.
Roger that, Starbuck.
Ready.
Ready.
Here we go.
Jump.
SAR team, Starbuck.
Form up on me.
Roger that skipper.
Any cylons, Helo?
Nothing on dradis.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Missing a raptor.
I'm only reading 17 out there.
We're missing raptor 6-12.
That's toughguy and carousel.
What, they jumped to
the wrong coordinates?
No.
No, no. I'm picking up their
transponder, so they made it.
Bearing 827, carom 443.
About half a klick from here.
That would put them...
oh, my gods.
Where, Helo?
Talk to me.
They jumped
inside the mountain.
Damn.
SAR team, Starbuck.
We've lost raptor 6-12.
We are proceeding without them.
Follow me.
Roger that Starbuck.
I would think that my position...
and the position of my
campaign is abundantly clear.
Madam President,
you have 30 seconds to respond.
Well, my initial response is
there he goes again.
Once again, ladies and gentlemen,...
Doctor Baltar is distorting
the real issues before us.
The issue here,
the real question, is...
not allowing the scriptures to
dictate the policy of this government.
The question is...
do the scriptures
contain real world relevance?
Do they contain the
information necessary...
to guide us to a safer home than
some completely unknown planet...
that we've just now discovered?
Obviously, my answer to that
question is yes.
I have always and will
continue to feel...
the scriptures hold
real world relevance.
Mr. Vice President,
the next question is for you.
Uh, how do you
respond to the charges...
that you seized the idea of...
permanent settlement
on this planet...
as an opportunistic
gamble, um,...
some would say as...
to be construed as a desperate
move from a campaign,...
uh, that was falling
behind on every poll?
Well, you know that is, um,...
that is an excellent question,
in fact, Jim. Thank you.
And I'm only too glad to
have the opportunity to respond to it.
You see, I have long been a
proponent in the search for Earth.
The promise of perhaps
finding not only a new home,...
but also the prospect of
discovering our long lost...
brothers and sisters of the 13th
colony is a powerful one...
and one I have believed
in heart and soul.
But the trouble is,...
the cylons continue
to follow us...
as they have done
every step of the way...
since the destruction
of the colonies.
And if we have a chance
to change this dynamic,...
to stop this deadly chase,...
should we take it?
My answer is yes.
Thank you.
Madam President, 30 seconds.
There's no assurance...
none whatsoever...
that the cylons don't already
know about this planet,...
that they don't make regular
stops here looking for us,...
and that in fact...
they aren't simply waiting for
us to settle on the surface...
- so they can...
- I have to respond to that.
I simply have to
respond to that.
I'll give you 15 seconds.
What you've seen right now,
ladies and gentlemen,...
is another example of
the President using fear...
to drive her campaign.
Fear.
Fear of the gods.
Fear of the cylon.
Fear of fear itself.
Is it not time to
stop being afraid?
I'm asking all of us...
to stop running
from our lives...
and start living them.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That is all we have time for today.
I'd like to thank, uh,...
both the candidates for
their frankness today.
Very exciting debate.
This concludes the cycle of
the debates for the presidency.
The polls will be
open in three days.
Please vote.
Thank you and good night.
Not your night, I guess.
Why don't you go frak yourself.
With me now is campaign
manager for Doctor Baltar,...
Mr. Tom Zarek.
Tom, welcome. Uh,
you were in there with us today.
What was your impression?
Well, I...
thought Doctor
Baltar did exceptionally well.
Laid out his vision of the future...
and offered the people a way
to end the suffering and terror...
that defines so many
of their lives.
On the other hand,
I found myself wondering how...
Roslin's arguments against
settlement could possibly win.
CYLON OCCUPIED CAPRICA
Let's go.
- right there.
- Go it.
Let's figure out
where we are, Karl.
Resistance base camp.
We're still...
another klick ahead.
Movement. Eleven o'clock
Friendlies?
You got a Samuel T. Anders there?
Is there a Kara Thrace there?
If there is,...
you tell her she took her
good, sweet time getting here.
Friendlies.
What took you so long?
We have marines in raptors.
We're gonna get you and your
people out of here, okay?
As good as your word, huh?
Yeah, good as my frakkin' word.
What, did you think I
was going to leave you here?
Now you feel like a big frakkin'
idiot, don't you?
All right, just shut up
and save us already, okay?
People, this is nice,
but we have toasters on our ass.
Where are the rest
of your people?
This is it.
Toasters hit our base
camp this morning.
I lost half my crew.
Incoming!
Back to the raptors!
No!
Shell trajectories are coming
between us and the raptors.
We're cut off!

CYLON OCCUPIED CAPRICA
They've got us zeroed in.
If we stay here,
they're gonna chew us up.
All right, we gotta fall back.
Position up this hill. Let's go!
All right, let's go, people!
Jaw set nicely. You're done here.
I'm kicking you out of here
and sending you back to work.
Work like this?
You gotta love a woman who can
complain even with her jaw wired shut.
You got a visitor.
I'm sorry.
What I did was... unforgivable,
inexcusable. I didn't come here to...
I forgive you.
No. Cally. No.
It wasn't you. I know
that. It wasn't you.
It was me. I... may
have been out of my mind
and not know where I was doing
or anything, but it was me.
You're in pain. You have been
in pain for a really long time.
Don't feel sorry for me.
I care about you. I always
have. And I always will.
Let's move! Let's go, let's go.
Move it, move it, move it.
Get a medic!
Sharon, take the gun!
They got us blocked
in here really good!
Frak! Can't raise the raptors.
The cylons have jammed the freq's.
Frak.
Still out there?
Watch yourself.
Yeah. They're holding back though.
Yeah, but why?
They're holding position.
Sending for nonlethal weapons.
They want some prisoners
for interrogation.
The rest they're
gonna send to the farm.
I'm not going back
to one of those farms.
Yeah, well, you won't have
any choice. None of us will.
They're gonna lob some gas in here and
then we'll all wake up somewhere else.
Damn.
So what do you want to do here?
Sit it out. Wait and
see if she's right.
If she is, then you and me,
we gotta have an agreement.
An agreement?
Not going back to one of
those farms, Sam. I'm not.
So if she's right and they throw
gas in here... you do me, I do you.
What are you talking about?
This is what I'm
talking about, okay?
Yeah, okay.
Okay.
Down two more points. And this after
hearing his notions of social policy.
Not to mention his wishful thinking
that he is calling "security policy."
Are people really
going to be that stupid?
Are they really going
to be that short-sighted?
He's got the only
issue people care about.
I know. The planet.
That's all anybody wants to talk
about is that frakkin' planet.
Excuse my language,
Tory, I'm sorry.
I know in my gut that settling on this
planet's gonna mean disaster for humanity.
And I will not say otherwise
just to win an election.
As you wish, Madam President.
So I guess I should
start packing up my office
unless you have some
super secret backup plan
for victory in your pocket.
There's always a
backup plan for victory.
Just in time for the priest.
Good. Send him in.
Eighteen hours. They're taking
their good sweet time out there.
They could've overrun us at
any point during the night.
They're up to something.
What are we up to?
Got any brilliant ideas in
that military brain of yours.
Do the same thing we always
do. Fight 'em till we can't.
What do you think?
Let's get a recon crew
together. Scout the area.
Figure out what's
going on out there.
They're gone. They just left.
Thank the gods!
It's a miracle.
Let us pray.
Lords of kobol, we trust in your
benevolence and praise your righteousness.
Give the people of this fleet
the wisdom to see the goodness
and the strength of your
servant, Laura Roslin. Amen.
Admiral?
Madam President.
The Admiral's not here.
This is my meeting.
I wanted us to talk privately
without the press getting wind of it.
Please have a seat.
Well, you must have
something very interesting
to say to resort to such
pedestrian methods of deception.
The question of permanent
settlement may well be
the most important issue
we face since the attack.
I agree.
Good. The question should be carefully
studied before making a final decision.
In the middle of an election campaign
is hardly the time for careful study.
Therefore I propose a truce. You and I
will issue a joint statement declaring
that the  question be tabled
till after this election.
We will both pledge that
regardless of who is elected,
the decision will be made
only after careful deliberation
involving all
elements of the public
and after consultation with the
military and the Quorum of Twelve.
Doctor, I know we've
had our disagreements,
but this issue transcends personal
disagreement as well as politics.
I am appealing here to
your sense of patriotism.
Let me tell you my sense of
patriotism is doing just fine.
Thank you very much for asking.
I see it as my patriotic duty to
lead this fleet to a new world.
That new world is
unquestionably New Caprica.
But thank you, Madam President,
for demonstrating to me
just how desperate your campaign
for re-election has become.
Were you with a blond woman on
Caprica just prior to the attack?
A what?
She knows.
Were you with a tall, blond
woman in the river walk
section of Caprica City
just prior to the attack?
She can see right through
you. Get out of here now.
You'll resort to anything
at this stage, won't you?
I'm afraid my affairs on Caprica
and who I chose to consort
with are none of your business.
I saved your life. I won't
save your political career.
We are not moving
down to that planet.
- If Baltar wins the election--
- Baltar won't win the gods-damn--
If he does, then what? We're
going to just sit on this ship
and rot while everyone else
gets to start a new life?
Ellen, my job is to protect
the fleet from the cylons
and that's exactly
what I'll be doing.
If you want to move down
there, go ahead, be my guest.
Go down and cat around with all the
men. Have yourself a good old time.
Saul, I want you.
XO. You gotta be kidding
me. I'll be right down.
Starbuck's back. I
gotta get down there.
You're going to be
okay. We're almost there.
Guys, take it easy
with it. Come on.
Am I good or what?
There's gonna be no
living with her now.
It's good to see you. Welcome back.
Thank you, sir. I brought
some friends with me.
I see.
Right. Right.
This is... This is
Samuel T. Anders.
I know who he is.
- Damn good to meet you, sir.
- Caprica Buccaneers.
That's right.
Hell of a player. I'm a
Picon Panther fan myself.
We enjoyed beating them too.
- It's good to have you aboard.
- Thank you.
I have news. Good news, actually.
The cylon occupation is
over. They left. They're gone.
- What are you talking about?
- It's true.
The cylons have left the colonies.
They're headed for
greener pastures.
- Security!
- What the hell?
Don't move! He's a cylon.
Back off, chief. We got it.
Well, this is an awkward moment.
Yes, he's right. I'm a cylon.
And I have a message. So
take me to your leader.
Take him to the brig.
Take that to the brig too.
What? Admiral, she didn't know.
Don't even start, Helo!
Of course she knew.
Welcome to Galactica.
Why the frak didn't
you say anything?
I don't know. Maybe
I didn't want to.
Maybe I wanted him to come
here and blow up the whole ship.
Is that what you're looking for?
You don't mean that.
Sharon, we finally got the Admiral to
start trusting us. Finally! And what?
They killed my baby.
You think I care about you or us or
whether the Admiral trusts me anymore?
Sharon! I love you!
And I'm not giving up this
frakkin' easy! Not after everything!
- You ready?
- All right.
Listen. You don't
have to get me drunk.
I will sleep with you, okay?
I figure I owe you one what
with you saving me and all.
- Little slut.
- Shut up.
Come here. Now you're
going to play hard to get.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
My hero.
Gods, I guess they'll let
anybody in here these days.
Hi.
Welcome back.
- Do you want to meet my man?
- Your man.
My personal property. Right, Sammy?
Don't call me Sammy.
How does it feel to be
my personal property?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And before you answer...
He loves it.
I'll bet he does.
I'm Lee, by the way.
- Hey. Sammy. I'm sorry.
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Pleasure. Shot?
- Sure. Why not?
Lee, when are you gonna
get yourself a girl?
I'm doing fine, thank you.
You're not still
frakkin' Dualla, are you?
Thanks a lot.
I mean, I'm not one
to like, you know,
lecture or anything 'cause
I'll do just about anything
to get into the pants of
some hot little young thing.
Is that all I am to you?
Yes. But you love it.
That's all right. I don't
mind doing charity work.
Where did he go?
I'm here to deliver a message.
After that, you can do whatever
you want with me. I don't care.
Would you mind telling
me what's going on?
I'm not a frakking cylon.
I'm not... Well... Okay, then.
Sorry to bust up your day, brother.
But there's been a change of plans.
It's been decided that the occupation
of the colonies was an error.
I could've told them
that. Bad thinking.
Faulty logic. Our first
major error of judgment.
Live and learn.
But the war heroes have managed to
swing opinion over to their side.
What heroes?
A six and an eight. One of the
eights you know as Sharon Valerii.
Their voices carry a lot of weight.
So when they started talking about
our mistakes and our corruption
and our need for a new beginning,
the rest of us listened.
You see, we're not like you.
We can admit our mistakes and
we're not afraid of change.
So you abandoned the colonies leaving
behind a devastated nuclear wasteland.
And we're supposed to be grateful.
Our pursuit of this fleet
of yours was another error.
That's two for anyone
who's keeping score.
Both errors led to the same result.
We became what we
beheld. We became you.
Amen. People should be true
to who and what they are.
We're machines. We
should be true to that.
Be the best machines the
universe has ever seen.
But we got it into our heads that
we were the children of humanity.
So instead of perusing
our own destiny of trying
to find our own path to
enlightenment, we hijacked yours.
You said it, brother. My
mission here is simple.
I'm to tell you that you've
been given a reprieve.
Cylon and man will now go their
separate ways, no harm done.
No harm.
You completely annihilated our race
and destroyed our civilization.
Now if you going to
start pointing fingers...
Where did the cylons go?
Back to their home world?
Well, I'd rather not say just now.
Let's just say we have other plans.
New marching orders
by your one true god.
There is no god.
Supernatural divinities
are the primitive's answer
for why the sun goes down at night.
At least that's what we've been
telling the others for years.
Can't really prove it one
way or the other, of course.
I know a way to prove it. Throw
them both out the air lock.
Let them see if there
really is a cylon god.
ELECTION DAY
Ballots from the
Adriatic. D? This way.
It's been an exciting day.
The election has been a
real roller-coaster ride.
The polls now have been
closed for about five hours.
Results have come in and
it's been a seesaw battle back
and forth between the Presidential
candidates all night long as we,
of course, expected it would be.
Uh, we're still waiting for a
few more numbers to come in now,
from the counting
room of Galactica,
which must tell you as some of
you may know, was a source of a bit
of a controversy yesterday.
Councilman Zarek had
filed a formal complaint
against the use of military
involvement in the election process.
Now it's just reached a compromise
was just reached late yesterday
allowing Galactica to provide
security for the balloting
as well as civilians to oversee
and monitor the situation.
Yes, okay. We have some
more votes coming in here.
Still not done.
But what we have so far is
6,282 more votes for Baltar,
which puts his total now
to 21,569. Is that correct?
And we also have Roslin.
Her total now is at 17,754.
We've had 2,981 more votes
come in for Roslin at this time.
So that is how things
are looking at this point.
We'll continue to bring you
up-to-the-minute coverage...
Yeah, it's me. Is this
a secure line? Okay.
There are only five ships left
to report in. We need to move now.
I'll take care of it.
Lieutenant, I'll be right back.
Are those the ballots
from the Zephyr?
Yes, sir.
All right, we'll take it from here.
We were told to take these
to the ballot room, sir.
Counting has already begun.
We'll take it from here.
Last one.
We have some more results
have come in here now.
Okay. 8,593 for Roslin,
which puts her over the top.
That's 24,265 for Laura
Roslin. Is that correct?
And 22,366 for Gaius Baltar.
We're going to check these again
because that has put her
over the top. She has done it.
She has retained the presidency
in an improbable comeback
in the final hours of the campaign.
Again, we would, of course,
like to check those
numbers, if we could.
But it appears that Laura Roslin
has retained the presidency
in defiance of the
polls, the pundits,
and the surveyors
of gloom and doom.
I've never seen a political
race end like this,
but it has just happened.
I am James McManus.
We'll check those numbers and
we'll be back to you very shortly.
Thank you.
I've seen a lot of
elections, Gaius.
Most honest, a few fixed.
And you can always tell the fixed
ones because they don't make sense.
And this doesn't make sense.
Laura Roslin is many things.
But she's not corrupt.
And she's not dishonest. It's over.
Congratulations, Madam President.
Thank you.
I hope you don't take
this the wrong way,
but are you as shocked as I am?
I'm relieved.
Well, you don't sound it.
I'm just tired. It's
been a long campaign.
Colonel, may I speak
to you for a moment?
What's up?
Sir, I'm afraid these ballots
from the Zephyr are wrong.
What the hell are
you talking about?
Doctor Baltar's name is spelled
correctly on these ballots.
But this morning, the
Zephyr called me and told me
their ballots had a misprint. They
misspelled Baltar's first name.
We didn't have time to print
new ballots, so I told them
on my authority to go
ahead and use them anyway.
Baltar's name is
spelled correctly here,
so they couldn't have come
from the Zephyr. They're frauds.
Now there's a complete chain
of custody from the Zephyr
all the way into this room.
So someone in the chain
is either a perpetrator
or at least a willing ally.
Thank you for bringing
this to my attention.
I'll take care of it from here.
Sir. We should at least
notify the civilian observers
and the press that these ballots...
I said I'll take
care of it from here.
Yes, sir.
Madam President,
you should celebrate.
It's a great victory
and you've earned it.
Excuse me.
Admiral, we'll talk
later. Thank you.
Adama.
Yes, sir. This is Lieutenant Gaeta.
Sir... I don't know
how to say this.
Fast and straight, I'd advise.
Yes, sir. Admiral, I
believe that Colonel Tigh
is involved in a conspiracy to rig
the election for President Roslin.
When I confronted the
colonel, he admitted his guilt.
He said he acted in collusion with
your campaign manager, Tory Foster.
Saul said tory contacted
him a few days ago.
He did it because he felt that Baltar
as President would be a disaster.
I said I agreed, but that
what he had done was illegal.
A judicial tribunal
may have to be convened.
Stop. I gave Tory the go-ahead.
I didn't know exactly
what she was planning.
I certainly did not
know about Colonel Tigh.
My gods. But I did know that
she was planning to fix the vote.
You tried to steal an election?
Yes, I did. And I got caught.
But Gaius Baltar cannot become
President of the Colonies, Bill.
It cannot happen.
Laura... I don't want him
as President either, but...
He's working with the cylons.
I saw him just before
the attack in Caprica
with a copy of the
tall blond cylon woman.
The same model who accused Baltar of
treason before disappearing from Galactica.
What the hell are you saying?
Why didn't you say
something before this?
Because I didn't remember
seeing him with that woman
until I remembered
it when I was dying.
I know how that
sounds, but it's real.
The same way Kobol is real,
and the Tomb of Athena is real,
and the map to earth is real.
Baltar is working with the cylons.
Even if that's true,
you have no proof.
No, I don't.
Do we steal the results of
a democratic election or not?
That's the decision. Because
if we do this, we're criminals.
Unindicted, maybe, but
criminals just the same.
Yes, we are.
You won't do it. We've gone
this far, but that's it.
'Scuse me?
You try to steal this election,
you'll die inside likely move
your cancer right to your heart.
The people made their choice.
We're gonna have to live with it.
It's the wrong choice.
Yes, it is.
All right. All right. All right.
So that's it. We just
give it up, just like that.
The battle, perhaps.
But not the war.
Well, the important thing is the
error was discovered and corrected.
You've been elected
President. Congratulations.
Thank you very much,
Admiral. Now about this error.
Exactly what kind of a tabulating
error could have occurred on your ship
that could've swung several
thousand votes away from me
in favor of your preferred
candidate, Admiral?
As soon as I have the time,
there will be an investigation.
I suggest that you take your victory
and you leave it at that, Doctor.
I think you'll find I can be
magnanimous in victory, Admiral.
And I believe the correct honorific
at this time is Mr. President elect.
Set course for New Caprica.
Jump completed. We are in
orbit around New Caprica.
We have all ships present
and accounted for, sir.
Send word to the Pegasus to launch their
initial ground team onto the surface.
Let's get a good look at our
new home. Gods help us all.
Well... well, I think
my ability to see you
will no doubt be constrained
by the responsibilities
and the requirements of my
new position. Listen to me.
My new position.
But obviously, we will
have the chance to connect,
to get together again
on New Caprica once...
I'm not going to New Caprica.
What? What are you talking about?
I'm not going to New Caprica.
We're all going to
New Caprica. All of us.
Every last, single one of us!
It's our chance to be together.
To be together again.
No.
I can't do this anymore.
Stay.
If you'll raise your right
hand and repeat after me.
"I, Gaius Baltar, do
now avow and affirm."
"I, Gaius Baltar, do
now avow and affirm."
"That I take the office of the
President of the 12 Colonies of Kobol
without any moral reservation
or mental evasion."
"That I take the office of
President of the 12 Colonies of Kobol
without any moral reservation
or mental evasion."
"That I will protect and defend
the articles of colonization."
"That I will protect and defend
the articles of colonization."
"With every fiber of my being."
"With every fiber of my being."
- Congratulations, Mr. President.
- Thank you.
I accept the role offered
to me by the Colonies
with humility and
gratitude. Thank you.
Wait, wait. No, no, wait. And now...
because it was the first will of the people,
I'm going to sign my
first executive order
requiring the fleet to
immediately establish settlements
on the planet we have come
to know as New Caprica.
Admiral Adama. You
have your orders.
We suspect the warhead
was stolen from your lab.
Then smuggled aboard
Cloud 9 by a Cylon agent.
I don't suppose I could interest
you in a cup of tea, Admiral?
Mr. President, this may be the first
step in a coordinated cylon attack.
I suggest our first priority would
be to focus in on internal security.
No. No, I don't think so.
Our first priority
is to the people.
See that they are safely
established on New Caprica.
Once  that's accomplished... We
can put this tragedy behind us.
You're not listening.
I don't have to listen.
I'm the President.
The settlement begins
and it begins now.
Mr. President. President
Baltar. Good morning, sir.
Good morning, sir.
Mr. President, the
Union needs their answer.
The union. If it's not
the union, it's the Quorum.
If it's not the Quorum,
it's the people's council.
ONE YEAR LATER
We survived a nuclear
holocaust, Mr. Gaeta.
And the people complain
about the weather.
- Sir, it's hardly the weather...
- Well, whatever it is.
How many cylon attacks have
there been since I took office?
- How many?
- None, sir.
None. Precisely. So why
do the people complain?
Tell the union to get
off their fat asses
and do some frakking
work for a change
or I'll start rounding
up their leaders
and holding them in detention. I
doubt they'll like that very much.
- I'll tell them, Mr. President.
- Thank you.
Morning. Where's
my, where's my pills?
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA
ORBITAL DEFENSE PATROL
DAY 380
- I'm telling you to go, okay?
- No, it's not okay.
I feel like I'm abandoning my post.
It's time to pack it
in, Saul. You know it.
More than half the crew is down
there on the ground already.
We can barely put a
squadron in the air to train,
much less fly a decent cap.
We're not really doing
too much up here anymore.
You're staying.
Yeah, well, someone has to
take care of the lighthouse.
Then I'll stay and take
care of it with you.
I appreciate that. But you know
there's only one person per lighthouse.
We both know the cylons
could still show up.
Anything's possible.
We've been orbiting New Caprica
longer than we ran after the attack.
I don't think they're
coming back anymore.
Colonel...
Good luck.
If she gives you too much trouble,
find yourself a younger one.
Attention, all
section four residents.
Please report to supply depots
to pick up weekly food rations.
NEW CAPRICA CITY POPULATION 39.192
Supplies are limited. Please
report as soon as possible.
You seen Sam?
- I think he's over there playing pyrimid.
- Thanks.
Set her up.
Sam, you idiot! I've been
looking for you everywhere.
What the hell are you thinking?
Looks like I'm in trouble.
Doc Cottle is here. You're sick.
You're supposed to be in bed.
I would rather work
this out of my system
right here than lie in bed all day.
Player 1: Sam, come on. Come on.
- Duty calls.
- You gotta be tough.
Let's go, Anders.
Tomorrow, man. Same
time, same score.
Can't believe I married
a moron. Are you okay?
Fine. I'm fine.
It's okay.
I'll be right back,
okay? Doc, wait. So?
There's fluid in the lungs.
It's probably pneumonia.
So give him something.
I'd love to. I've been out
of antibiotics for months.
So what, that's it?
I have a lot of patients to see.
But he's young and he's
strong. So make him rest.
Keep him warm. And with a
little luck, he'll make it.
Son of a bitch.
Everybody, please. Just calm down.
Please just calm down. Everybody
listen just for a second.
Please. Please. Be quiet!
Shut the frak up!
When you elected
me union President,
I promised I would keep us
working, keep benefits flowing.
But most of all,
keep this city alive.
I promised we would
stay on the job.
And well hey. And
building a better tomorrow.
- Look at you.
- Hi.
I'm so glad you guys are here.
Me too. It's pretty...
pretty exciting.
Yeah, that wears off.
- So what's going on here?
- President Baltar.
Sir, Anders is really sick.
But Doc Cottle's
giving me the runaround
and says there's no antibiotics.
And that's a load of crap.
Anything you can do to help
me cut through the red tape.
You should give Apollo a call.
Pegasus is sitting on the backup
meds. He'd spring some for you.
Yeah. I doubt that.
That was a long time
ago. People change.
Okay.
But there comes a
time when you realize
that the engine you've
built with your blood
and your sweat and your tears is
being used for something so foul,
so perverted that it makes
you sick in your heart.
And it's then that you
must throw your body
on the gears and on the levers
and on the machine itself
and make it stop. And you have
to show the people who run it,
the people who control
it, that unless we're free,
that machine will be
prevented from working at all.
Strike! Strike! Strike!
Okay. Everybody have that so far?
Yes.
Good, you're listening.
Think the President has a
bit of a problem on his hands.
I also want you to
look at chapter ten.
It's the history of the 12
colonies. It's really interesting.
The President's problems are
not our problems, are they?
That's right. Our problems are
homework for everyone tonight.
Now some of you are
going to stay and help me
with the art project
for the presentation.
Everyone else, your
parents are here.
Get your stuff, let's go.
Go on. Get out of here.
Good job. Yeah. Okay.
Bye, honey. Thanks.
Good job. Good job.
Thank you, parents.
You know what, why don't
you and the baby go on, okay?
- I'll finish up here.
- You sure?
Yes. Yes. Go ahead. Thank you.
Bubble head. A bubble
head. I love this.
Hello. Hello, Isis.
BATTLESTAR PEGASUS
LEE ADAMA, COMMANDING
What's going on?
- It's for you.
- Who is it?
- It's for you.
- Who is it?
Right.
What do you want?
I need a favor.
Is that right?
I hear that you're hoarding a
bunch of antibiotics for the pilots.
Where did you hear that?
Anders is sick. He has pneumonia,
Lee. I think that he might die.
Commander.
Wait. Yeah, lieutenant. What is it?
I'm not sure. Picking
up something on dradis.
Dradis? How can you see
anything in that soup?
There it is.
What is it?  Wait, what is that?
Oh, my gods, it's a cylon fleet.
They found us. They found us.
We have to get out of here, sir.
We can't just leave
all those people behind.
There's nothing we can do.
It's taken us forever just to
get to action stations over here.
We're in no shape for a fight, sir.
They'll be wiped out.
We don't have a choice. We need
to get out of here right now.
All decks finally report
condition one, sir.
Should we launch
the alert fighters?
Begin jump prep. We're leaving.
But we'll be back. Start your prep.
Mr. President! Mr. President!
- Don't you knock?
- Gaius. Gaius!
Yeah, what is it?
The cylons just jumped into
orbit and the fleet's jumped away.
Judgment day.
I'm looking for Kara Thrace.
I'm Gaius Baltar.
President of the Colonies.
I know who you are, Gaius.
I know very well.
As long as you offer no
resistance, you won't be harmed.
How do I know that?
You don't. You also
don't have any choice.
How did you find us?
It was quite by accident, actually.
We were over a
light-year away from here
when we detected the radiation
signature of a nuclear detonation.
Very well. on behalf of the people
of the 12 Colonies, I surrender.
What do you want
to do now, Captain?
The same thing we always do,
fight them until we can't.

Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.
Now you tell me you're a machine.
A robot.
You knew I wanted access
to defence mainframe.
Do you have any idea
what they'd do to me if they find out?
Get down.
Moments ago,
this ship received word...
that the Cylon attack
against our home worlds is underway.
As of this moment, we are at war.
All right, we can take three more people.
Giving up my seat.
I've decided you're an expression
of my subconscious mind...
playing itself out during my waking states.
So I'm in your head?
No.
There're maybe Cylon agents
living among us.
Some may not even know
they're Cylons at all.
They could be sleeper agents...
programmed to perfectly impersonate
human beings until activation.
And one minute to mark.
God has a plan for you, Gaius.
He has a plan for everything and everyone.
Gaius? Are you even listening to me?
Passengers, 30 seconds to mark.
Planet. Men. Women. Age.
You know what? Do this after the jump.
It's all right.
You have to believe in something.
I believe in a world
that I can and do understand.
A rational universe.
Explained through rational means.
I love you. That's not rational.
I know.
No, but you're not rational.
You're also not really here.
Neither am I.
Madam President,
ladies and gentlemen...
our 33 minutes are almost up once again.
Please prepare for our faster-than-light jump.
Thank you.
Cutting it a little close this time,
aren't we, Billy?
Pilot says he's had to reboot
the FTL computer again.
Why do the Cylons come
every 33 minutes?
Why isn't it 34, 35...
Cally.
What?
Shut up.
Fifteen seconds.
Sir, Jump 237 underway.
Fifty-three ships have jumped.
Ten still reporting trouble
with their FTL drives...
including Colonial One.
We're getting slower.
Maybe this time.
Dradis contact.
It's the Cylons.
- Damn it.
- Not this time, maybe the next.
Got another idea for the next cycle.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm afraid the Cylons have appeared again.
However, our FTL drive is now working
and we will jump momentarily.
Five days now.
There are limits...
to the human body, the human mind.
Tolerances that you can't push beyond.
Well, those are facts...
provable facts.
Everyone has a limit.
All right, you know the drill, people.
Scatter formation.
Keep them off the civies
and don't stray beyond the recovery line.
Watch the ammo hoists for the main guns.
You've got a red light right there.
We have a hit on the starboard
bow. Away the damage control parties.
Basestar is launching raiders.
Colonial One is ready to jump.
All civilian ships away,
including Colonial One.
Recover fighters. Stand by to jump.
Combat landings.
- All fighters aboard, sir.
- Execute jump.
Jump 237 complete.
All civilian ships
present and accounted for, sir.
Start the clock.
And let's start prepping for the next jump.
Clock is running. Thirty-three minutes.
Mark.
You have 32 minutes, people.
You know you're not safe.
No, of course not.
The Cylons will follow us again...
as they have the last 237 times.
You're right, you know.
There are limits.
- Eventually, you'll make a mistake.
- And then you'll kill us all.
Yes.
Yes, I know.
But not for another 33 minutes.
I want to try
something new this time.
Divide the fleet into six groups.
And they jump...
And they jump two more times
and on the fourth jump, we rendezvous at...
a common set of coordinates.
Twenty-four jumps to plot,
we're breaking our humps...
calculating one jump every 33 minutes.
Get off my jacket.
- You eating this?
- Not anymore.
Combat landings expected again
to be the order of the day...
so double-check
your undercarriage before...
Look, you all have done this 237 times.
You know what to do.
No mistakes.
And let's make it to 238.
Good luck and be careful out there.
Can you do me a favour?
Tell Capt. Apollo he owes me one wing.
You got it, dude.
No, Cally, there's three. I know there's three.
- Can you check it again for me, please?
- Yeah.
Let's get some of them starting to work.
We'll sleep when we're dead.
Come on.
Boomer.
Heard the latest?
They say Cylons look like us now.
- Primary fuel?
- Primary fuel 2893 KRG.
Marine told one of the pilots that
we marooned some guy back on Ragnar...
because they actually thought
that he was a Cylon.
You know what? I don't give a frak.
Red light on the number four thruster.
Go make a visual ID. See if it's blocked.
- Right.
- "Right."
A little rough on your new ECO,
don't you think?
He's not my ECO.
He's some refugee from Triton
that I'm saddled with and I didn't ask you.
- Helo's gone, Sharon.
- I didn't ask you that, either.
Sorry.
- Colony?
- Saggitaron. How many have you got?
5,251 survivors from Saggitaron, last count.
We can't transmit photos yet.
If you want, you can leave them with us...
or you can put them on the board outside.
Sorry.
Thanks.
Next.
Colony?
Update on the headcount,
Madam President.
How did we lose 300?
There were some overcounts...
a few deaths from wounds
and a few missing during the last attack.
Do you want children, Gaius?
Let me think about it for a minute.
No.
Procreation is one of God's commandments.
Really?
I'm sure some day
if you're a good Cylon he'll reward you...
with a lovely little walking toaster
of your very own.
I want us to have a child, Gaius.
You can't be serious.
- It's Dr. Amarak.
- What was that?
I'm so sorry for interrupting you
while you were speaking.
You were just saying?
I was just saying that a Dr. Amarak...
- has requested to speak with the President.
- Dr. Amarak. I see.
You know him?
Have you always been able to multitask
like this?
Yes.
I used to work with him
at the Ministry of Defence.
It says here that
he's uncovered important information...
regarding how the Cylons
were able to defeat colonial defences.
I was always a little worried he was on to us.
Were you going to speak to him?
Perhaps I should speak to him
if you're busy.
I think he wanted to speak directly
with the President.
It sounded urgent.
It must be very important.
Maybe something about a certain traitor
in the President's inner circle?
There's not enough time before we jump.
I want him on board first thing
during the next cycle.
Thank you, Doctor.
- I'd say you have a serious problem.
- lf I can help.
He's a strange one, isn't he?
Landing base Team Alpha,
check three.
Can you see it?
Twelve more cases of nervous exhaustion.
That makes 61.
Have the docs start pumping them up
with stimulants...
and get them back on the line.
Pilots, too.
Fuel report.
One out of every three, every other cycle.
That's gonna come back
and bite us on the ass.
We have too much work
and not enough people to do it.
Fuel report.
- I've already signed one of these.
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
Comm traffic two from the President.
- Is this my 10 minutes or this yours?
- Yours. I took 10 last time.
See you guys in combat.
I believe it was your 10 minutes.
If the old man's so tired he can't remember,
then it's his turn.
- You see the note from the XO?
- Yeah, I saw it. No way.
Kara, everyone else...
I don't fly with stims.
They blunt your reflexes, your reaction time.
- Come on, Kara, give me a break. Just...
- Why are we arguing about this?
I have no idea.
Neither do I. You're the CAG, act like one.
What the hell does that mean?
It means that you're still acting
like you're everyone's best friend.
We're not friends, you're the CAG.
"Be careful out there"?
Our job isn't to be careful,
it's to shoot Cylons out of the frakking sky.
"Good hunting" is what you say.
And now, one of your idiot pilots
is acting like a child...
and refusing to take her pills.
So she either says, "Yes, sir"...
and obeys a direct order
or you smack her in the mouth...
and you drag her sorry ass down to sickbay
and you make her take those pills.
Well, I'm glad I'm not working for you.
You're damn right you're glad.
So, do I have to smack you in the mouth,
Lieutenant?
No, sir. I'll take my pills.
Perfect.
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.
Pilots to ready room
for pre-flight briefing. Pilots to ready room.
What?
Jump 238 complete.
Start the clock.
Thirty-three minutes.
Mark.
All civilian ships present and...
Strike my last.
One civilian ship
missing and unaccounted for, sir.
Which one?
The Olympic Carrier.
Commercial passenger vessel.
Were they left behind?
I think I accounted
for all civilian ships before we left.
You think? Did you or didn't you?
They're not logged in, sir.
I think they may have been left behind.
How many people aboard ship?
1,345 souls, sir.
You're telling me we left over 1,300 people
to die at the hands of the Cylons?
It may not have been her fault, sir.
It may have been a navigational error
and they jumped to the wrong coordinates...
or the Cylons destroyed the ship
before the jump...
Or 50 other things may have happened.
The point is we don't know
what the hell did happen.
Yes, we're tired. Yes, there's no relief.
Yes, the Cylons keep coming after us
time after time...
and yes, we are still expected to do our jobs.
We make mistakes, people die.
There aren't many of us left.
Carry on.
Okay. Next crisis?
- List of calls?
- Yes.
But first, where's the doctor
who's supposed to be on board?
What's his name?
- Dr. Amarak.
- Yes.
Dr. Amarak.
Oh.
He was on the Olympic Carrier.
God is watching out for you, Gaius.
The universe is a vast and complex system.
Coincidental, serendipitous events...
are bound to occur.
Indeed they are to be expected.
- It's part of the pattern, part of the plan.
- Dr. Amarak posed a threat to you.
Now he's gone.
Logic says there's a connection.
A connection, maybe. But not God.
There is no God or gods, singular or plural.
There are no large invisible men,
or women for that matter...
in the sky taking a personal interest
in the fortunes of Gaius Baltar.
Be careful.
That which God gives, he can also take away.
Fifteen seconds.
Maybe this time.
Dradis?
No enemy contacts.
Keep the clock running.
What do you think?
I think we wait.
Get me the President.
Why this time?
Was it something that you did?
We had a new plan,
but we didn't have time to implement it yet.
We lost a ship during the last cycle,
the Olympic Carrier.
Does that have something to do with it?
Possibly.
Are you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
What do we do now, Commander?
I've got people on the verge over here.
We're gonna go to Condition Two.
We have to take advantage of this time...
- and let our people get some rest.
- All right.
And how long do we stay at Condition Two?
Until I'm satisfied they're not going to return.
It's a military decision.
It is. I know that.
You're right and I defer to your decision.
And, Commander...
let your men and women...
know how grateful I am
for the job that they are doing, please.
Thank them for me.
Thank you, Madam President.
Thank you.
Contact Apollo.
Tell him to set up a combat patrol
around the fleet...
and order his other pilots
to land immediately.
All right, people, you heard the order.
Boomer, Starbuck, form up with me.
We'll fly the first CAP.
I want everyone else
back on Galactica and in their racks.
Three-hour rotation.
Hey, Apollo...
not that I'm not honoured by being chosen
to sit in my cockpit...
for the next three hours but...
But why you?
- Take a guess.
- Because I'm on drugs?
You got it.
This patrol is 100% stimulated.
Anyone else feels like...
they've got frakking ants crawling
behind their eyeballs?
How about you, Boomer?
Doc tells me you're holding up
better than anybody in the squadron.
I'm tired like everybody else.
You never seem it.
Because she's a Cylon.
You're gonna make me come over there
and kick your ass.
Okay. Let's set up a patrol here...
before somebody gets hurt.
Follow me.
Copy that, Apollo.
A couple hours rack time
does sound awfully sweet...
right about now.
You deserve it.
Thank you. The truth is...
all this has me feeling
more alive than I have in years.
You look that way, too.
It's good to you
without the cup in your hand.
Don't start.
I know there's a whole lot of people
aboard this ship...
that wish you weren't feeling
as good as you were.
If the crew doesn't hate the XO,
then he's not doing his job.
Besides, got to make the old man look good.
I always look good.
- Did you look in a mirror?
- Seriously...
Sir.
...it's one thing to push a crew,
it's another to break them.
Dradis contact.
Bearing 348, carom 120, one ship.
Getting recognition signal.
Initiating response flash mode.
Alpha, alpha.
It's the Olympic Carrier, sir.
Is that confirmed?
It's confirmed, sir.
Thank the gods.
Action stations.
Put the fleet into Condition One.
I want all Vipers manned and ready,
but keep them in the tubes.
Mr. Gaeta.
Sir?
Restart the clock. Thirty-three minutes.
- Hope you're wrong.
- So do I.
Clock is running.
So do I.
No. It's all wrong.
If they were left behind,
why didn't the Cylons destroy them?
And why are they showing up now?
It's God's punishment for your lack of faith.
That's just great, that is.
A more logical and useful explanation,
please.
All right.
The Olympic Carrier has been infiltrated
by Cylon agents.
They've been tracking the ship all along.
No.
Then that means...
Logically, in order for you to survive...
the Olympic Carrier should be destroyed.
Olympic Carrier...
this is Raptor 478, call sign Boomer.
I have you in visual contact.
Please respond to this channel. Over.
Raptor 478, this is the Olympic Carrier.
We have you in visual contact.
Thank the Lords of Kobol. You don't know
how relieved we are to see you.
Roger that, Olympic Carrier.
Can I ask about your whereabouts?
We had trouble with our FTL drive.
Took us almost three hours to fix.
Have Boomer ask them
how they escaped the Cylons.
Olympic Carrier, Boomer.
I've been directed to ask how you escaped
from the Cylons.
They were closing in on us
when the rest of you were jumping.
I thought we were goners,
then they just broke off.
Someone must've been watching out for us.
Roger that.
One other thing, Boomer.
I've got a Dr. Amarak on board...
who has an urgent matter to discuss
with the President.
- He's been driving me crazy.
- Can you be more specific?
I can't. He says he knows
something about a traitor in our midst...
and he's unwilling to share more than that.
Madam President, I strongly recommend...
that we cut off all wireless communication
with that ship right away.
Why?
Look, forgive me for being rude,
but wake up, all right?
The Olympic Carrier is still flying
because the Cylons let them survive.
They've been tracking that ship all along.
- There's probably a Cylon agent aboard now!
- Calm down.
Start over.
Please, Madam President, I implore you.
Listen to me.
Cut off radio communication with that ship...
before they send via broadcast signal
another computer virus...
to affect our ship
shortly before they blow us all up.
Commander Adama, are you on the line?
Cut off the speakers.
Put her through on the line.
Yes, Madam President.
And I'm inclined to agree with Dr. Baltar.
Good. So do I.
Thank the gods you're with us.
God's got nothing to do with this.
Boomer, Galactica.
Your orders are to jam all transmissions
from the Olympic Carrier.
No further voice contact is authorised.
Roger that, Galactica.
Boomer, Galactica.
Orders are to send the Olympic Carrier
the following message by signal light.
Message begins: Maintain present position.
Do not, repeat, do not approach
the fleet until further notice.
Message ends.
I'm getting a bad feeling
about where this is headed.
So am I.
If the ship poses a threat to us,
we have to eliminate that threat.
I don't think they got the message, Apollo.
Yeah, I see it. Boomer,
break wireless silence on my authority.
Warn them to stop their engines immediately.
I suggest that we evacuate the passengers,
then destroy the ship.
Solves the problem
if they're tracking the ship.
What if they're tracking
one of the passengers?
Olympic Carrier...
you are ordered to stop your engines
immediately. Acknowledge.
Apollo, they're not responding.
Are you using the same channel?
Yeah,
but suddenly nobody's home.
Starbuck, fire a burst across their bow.
Copy that.
Boomer, let Galactica know we have
a problem out here.
Commander, message from Boomer.
The Olympic Carrier is heading
directly for us, sir.
They're refusing all orders to stop.
Galactica,
they're still not responding...
and continue to head towards the fleet.
Request instructions.
Order the fleet to execute Jump 240.
Get us between that ship and the fleet.
Commander! Dradis contact.
Strike that, multiple Dradis contacts.
It's the Cylons.
The Cylons
are on an intercept course.
They'll be in weapons range
within two minutes.
Radiological alarm!
- Radiological alarm!
- From where?
The Olympic Carrier, sir.
They've got nukes on board.
Madam President, we have to eliminate
the Olympic Carrier immediately.
There are 1,300 people on that ship.
We don't know that.
The Cylons may have captured them already.
She's not going to do it. She has to do it.
- It's not her decision, Gaius.
- No?
It's God's choice.
He wants you to repent.
Look, at this point there's no choice.
It's either them or us.
Repent of your sins...
and accept his true love
and you will be saved.
I repent. Then I'll repent.
I repent.
Do it.
We have new orders.
We're directed to destroy
the Olympic Carrier...
and return to Galactica.
It's a civilian ship.
Yeah, a civilian ship with nukes.
I don't see anybody in there,
do you?
The Cylons will be here any second.
If we're going to do this, then just do it.
Starbuck, form up with me.
We'll make one pass from astern.
Lee, what if you're wrong?
Lee, come on.
Okay, fire on my mark.
No frakking way, Lee.
Lee? Come on!
Mark.
Are you alive?
Agathon, Karl C.
Lieutenant, junior grade, Colonial fleet.
- PK-789-9348.
- I know who you are, Helo.
It's all right. I'm a friend.
Sharon?
What are you doing here?
Can you walk?
Yeah, I think so.
- What are you doing here, I thought...
- Let's move, mister.
Sir.
Son.
I gave the order. It's my responsibility.
I pulled the trigger.
That's mine.
Madam President?
Madam President?
I'm sorry, you were saying something?
Twenty-four hours, no Cylons.
- At least you know it was the right choice.
- The right choice.
I'm sorry, Billy.
I think I'd like some time alone, please.
Of course.
What is it?
- Update on the headcount?
- Subtract how many?
Actually, you can add one.
A baby was born this morning
on the Rising Star.
A boy.
- A baby.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.
Radiological alarm!
From where?
The Olympic Carrier, sir.
They've got nukes on board.
If the ship poses a threat to us,
we have to eliminate that threat.
The Cylons will be here any second.
If we're gonna do this, then just do it.
- It's a civilian ship.
- Do it.
- Giving up my seat.
- Like hell.
Sharon? What are you doing here?
Let's move, mister.
- Excuse me, Lieutenant.
- Specialist. Good evening.
- Sir?
- Is something wrong?
No, sir. It's just morning, sir.
- What time is it?
- 0545.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Where are the rest of them?
Attention. Colonial One will arrive
in 30 minutes.
Honour detail report in quarters.
Where the hell is it?
Damned son of a... sash.
I heard you the first time!
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Do it.
I can't stop thinking
about the Olympic Carrier.
That was three days ago.
It's ancient history
under these circumstances.
Leave the second-guessing to the historians.
But don't we have a responsibility?
I mean, as leaders, don't we have
an obligation to question our actions to...
I don't know. To make sure the decisions
we make are the right decisions.
We did what we had to do, Son.
A man takes responsibility for his actions,
right or wrong.
He accepts the consequences
and lives with them...
every day.
Colonial One, Galactica.
Proceed to Omega Docking.
Contact CIC when you have hard seal.
Roger that, Galactica.
Excuse me, Madam President.
We've arrived...
Please don't tell me
that we have to go through this...
every time I step on that ship.
No, ma'am. But they will always
render honours for your arrival. It's protocol.
The military, they do love their protocol.
I'm sure if they knew you didn't like it,
they'd be willing to...
No. Let Adama sound the trumpets.
It makes him feel more comfortable.
Maybe if he feels more comfortable...
- he'll be a little easier to deal with.
- That's smart.
No, it's not smart. It's politics.
I think I'm going to get tired
of this outfit.
Seeing as I only have three
for the rest of my life.
- That looks fine.
- Fine?
It looks great.
You don't know anything
about women, do you?
- Shall we?
- Let's go be "presidential."
I am confident that I speak for the entire fleet
when I say thank you.
Without your extraordinary dedication,
your tireless effort, your sacrifice...
no one of us would be here today.
I'm proud to serve as your President.
Thank you.
Carry on.
Sir, the Virgon Express
is manoeuvring alongside.
- They're standing by for unrep.
- Thank you very much, D.
Officer of the Watch,
you'll proceed with the unrep, please.
Aye, sir.
If you'll step this way.
Thank you.
- Excuse me, Chief. A word with you, please.
- Just one second.
You know what? Just let's do it. What's up?
Got a problem.
Yes, sir, Lieutenant, sir.
I believe the navcon modules
are ready for inspection.
Virgon Express, Galactica.
We have you in visual contact.
Maintain current course and speed.
Roger that, Galactica.
Maintain current course and speed.
Powering up stabilisation gyros
24A through 48C.
Galactica's water recycling system
is close to 100% effective.
For all intents and purposes, there's not
a drop of water that's wasted aboard.
We have enough water
for several years before replenishing.
- I see.
- Many of the ships like the Virgon Express...
were not made for long-term voyages...
- and will have to tank off of us periodically.
- Right.
Whatever it is, we're gonna take care of it,
okay? You all right?
Now, tell me what happened.
What's going on?
There are at this moment
six G-4 detonators...
missing from the small-arms locker
on Deck 15.
Commander, ready to extend the water boom.
Excuse me.
How's it going?
Oh, boy, I feel like a...
- Tour guide?
- It shows?
Well, she was a teacher.
Probably sees all this
as one big educational experience.
- He thinks I'm a total idiot, doesn't he?
- What? No, sir. No.
It's all right.
What are you telling me for?
If munitions go missing,
you got to tell the master-at-arms now!
I know that!
You can't screw around with stuff like this!
I'm not screwing around, okay?
The only reason I didn't tell anybody...
is 'cause they're gonna think
I'm the one who took them.
How are things?
Things are good.
Good.
You look good.
I really like your hair.
My hair?
I don't know anything about women.
Madam President, if I may?
I think you should know that my father...
- Well, this entire ceremony was his idea.
- I know.
I think he's enjoying it.
Actually, he hates protocol, pomp,
and all that.
- Really?
- He's making a gesture.
Trying to make you feel like the President.
Open Valves 3 and 5.
I took the one detonator
from the duffel, replaced it...
and then I went back to my quarters.
Well...
You know what? It's not your fault.
Someone's obviously setting you up
to take the fall for something.
That's what it is.
You wake up somewhere,
you don't know how you got there.
You're drugged, or manipulated,
or who knows what. Something.
What do we do?
Because if I report what's happened,
they'll think I'm a Cylon agent.
No, they're not. No.
Why would they think that? That's crazy.
People are getting crazy, okay?
You've heard the rumours.
Cylons who look like humans,
sleeper agents hiding in the fleet.
Decompression alarm!
Damage report, Mr. Gaeta.
Ruptures in Tanks 3, 5, 7, 9.
Strain on the unrep lines.
They're gonna blow.
Release the lines. Veer away, starboard!
Every tank on the port side has ruptured.
We're venting all our water
directly into space.
CIC, it's DC One. We're entering the tank.
Roger that, DC One.
Raptor 478, DC One. I have you in my sights.
Copy that, DC One, I have you in sight.
Understood.
How's it look in there?
Can you tell what happened?
Lieutenant, don't worry...
about my team. I've got things under control.
Copy that, DC One.
I feel better knowing you're on it.
Watch the light, you're off target.
How much water did we lose?
Ten million JPs, sir.
Almost 60% of total potable water reserves.
Emergency rations.
Shut down laundry, showers,
anything nonessential immediately.
Yes, sir.
- How long will our water supplies last?
- Aboard Galactica, about six days.
But one-third of the other ships in the fleet
were depending on us for replenishment.
If we don't find new supplies
they'll run out of water in two days.
One-third? That's 16,000 people.
Get the names of those ships.
Tell their captains to go
on emergency rations immediately.
There's gonna be riots in those ships.
Civilians don't like hearing they can't
take a bath, wash their clothes...
- or drink more than a thimble a day.
- Thank you for the warning, Colonel.
- That'll be all, Mr. Gaeta.
- One more thing. Lieutenant?
Do you have any theories
about what may have caused the accident?
There are many theories at this point,
Madam President.
Do you have a guess?
I tell my officers not to guess.
I prefer to wait until we have fact.
Um-hm. Indulge me.
Take a guess, Mr. Gaeta.
I'd have to say
the most likely explanation is...
that the tank was structurally weakened
during the Cylon nuclear detonation...
during the first attack,
and that caused it to buckle and rupture.
But it's too early to say. Sir.
Interesting.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- Back to the matter at hand.
I've ordered an astronomical survey
of nearby stars systems...
- for potential water sources. Colonel?
- Yes, sir.
Chief, take a look at this.
What do you got?
Not sure.
It looks like burn marks
from an explosive.
What do you think?
Umm...
It's tough to tell.
It's pretty rusted out.
Optical and x-ray telescopes say
there are five systems...
within our practical jump radius.
All five have planetary bodies
with the potential for finding water...
in either a liquid or a frozen state.
Put together a plan for Raptors
to scout each star system.
- I want the first launch at 17:30.
- Yes, sir.
Colonel, how likely are we
to find water on any of these planets?
Now you want me to guess, I take it.
- Colonel.
- Sir.
My apologies, Madam President.
Difficult day for everyone.
I understand.
Most planets are just hunks of rock
or balls of gas.
The galaxy's a pretty barren, desolate place
when you get right down to it.
Thank you, Colonel.
The water rationing'll
make our supply problem worse.
Dr. Baltar, please share the results
of your study.
I've calculated the rate of consumption
regarding basic foodstuffs...
for the civilian population.
This is based on information
available to me at the time.
The current civilian population of 45,265...
will require, at minimum...
82 tons of grain, 85 tons of meat...
119 tons of fruit, 304 tons of vegetables...
- and 2.5 million JPs of water.
- Is that per month?
Per week.
They found your Raptor.
A few or a lot?
That's what you get
for coming back for me.
Frack.
Yeah.
I was sure they didn't track me coming in.
- I know.
- I set the jiggers to pulse.
I'm sure you did.
I didn't set off any detection grids,
any dradis sweeps, or pingers.
- Never send a pilot to do an ECO's job.
- I can do your job.
I guess that's why the toasters are crawling
all over our ride out of here.
I don't suppose there's a Plan B.
Plans B, C, D and E are the same as Plan A.
Get off the planet and get back to the ship.
Come on.
Where are we going?
Don't ask questions.
Just follow your pilot.
Yes, sir.
Umm...
So far we've found five discrete
detonation points in the tank...
and we believe that there may be a sixth.
I've suspected due to the size
of the residual scoring...
and the burn points...
that we are dealing with a G-4 type explosive.
So I've requested a spot check
of all inventory...
from the master-at-arms
and she indicated to me...
that there are six detonators missing
from a small-arms locker...
in the port flight pod.
So one detonator may still be
unaccounted for.
Have the master-at-arms post guards
at all small-arms lockers immediately.
It's already done, sir.
She also has opened an investigation...
into who may have had access to that locker.
However, due to spotty record-keeping...
and lax internal security procedures
since the attack...
she believes that we may never know
who took the detonators.
Chief, thank you very much.
Everyone except for Col. Tigh,
Capt. Adama, and Dr. Baltar...
are now released.
Please remember:
this briefing is strictly confidential.
There is at least one Cylon
aboard the Galactica.
How many people know
the Cylons look human?
The rumour mill's been working overtime.
Half the ship's talking about it.
There'll always be rumours.
For most people, that's all they'll ever be.
I'm asking how many people actually know?
The five people in this room,
plus three Marines.
Let's keep it that way.
Once this gets out officially...
people will be accusing each other
of being Cylons for no reason at all.
I agree. Dr. Baltar,
how're we doing on the screenings?
The screenings?
You were supposed to be screening
Galactica crew for potential Cylon agents.
Do you remember
the first time you lied to a woman?
Other than your mother, that is.
Other than my mother.
Sherry Bennett. Fourth grade.
On the playground, behind the band room.
"If you show me yours, I'll show you mine."
She did. I did not.
You know, I think I slept with her actually,
many years later, of course.
Of course.
Did she turn out to be
a beautiful woman?
As a matter of fact, she did.
Very beautiful.
But every woman has her beauty...
her feminine charms that are hers
and hers alone.
Doctor?
Doctor?
The screenings.
To tell you the truth,
there are significant problems...
with implementing
my Cylon detection method...
that I used aboard Galactica previously...
and basically because
I've run out of natural resources.
I need chemical compounds.
For example, the precursor test.
I need large samples of tetrahydrocycline...
which I don't have to tell you...
Maybe I do have to.
It's a highly volatile chemical...
Let me stop you there.
Your intellect obviously outstrips
everyone in this room.
But it's also obvious
by the way that you're talking...
that in order to make
large-scale screenings...
you're going to need help, staff, resources.
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Exactly.
Although, more staff?
Someone snooping around,
watching your every move?
Maybe it'll be a woman,
you could find her secret beauty.
I'm going to assign Lt. Gaeta
to aid you...
in anything that you might need.
So much for that.
But the need for secrecy?
Clearly, this falls
into the "absolutely necessary" category.
Your screening techniques
may be critical to our very survival.
Humanity's very survival rests in your hands.
Now, if only you had
an actual Cylon detector.
This is a critical mission.
Fights have already broken out
on some ships over the rations.
There's panic in the air. You don't find water
out there and find it soon...
- I understand, Captain. We'll find it.
- Good hunting.
Hey, Chief.
Captain.
- Lieutenant.
- Chief.
I feel like my head's about to explode.
Just relax, calm down.
Focus on the mission.
We'll take care of everything
when you get back.
What about the investigation?
Master-at-arms is running it.
Don't worry, there's no connection to you.
In fact, there's no reason to believe
you had anything to do with it at all.
I didn't.
I know.
- I would never do something like that. Never.
- Sharon, I know.
It's really important you believe me on this.
- You do believe me, right?
- Absolutely.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Chief. Carry on.
Please excuse me for keeping you waiting.
I was called into the engine room.
It'll just take a moment.
That's all right.
Sometime I'd like to borrow a book or two.
I only brought one with me
on the flight to Galactica.
What book?
A Murder on Picon.
I have a weakness for mystery.
Ever read Dark Day?
Edward Prima. I am embarrassed to say...
it's one of those classics
I've never gotten around to reading.
I think you'll enjoy it.
Thank you.
It may be a while
before I get this back to you.
It's a gift. Never lend books.
Well, then thank you for the gift.
I'm really looking forward
to working with you, Doctor.
- You have a friend.
- As am I, Lieutenant.
I actually studied genetics in college.
I was planning on going
for my graduate degree...
through the military extension program.
Wonderful. Is that a card game?
And the girl wins again. Another round?
Come on, guys. Grace under pressure.
Nothing like losing a little money
to take your mind off those 14-hour patrols.
- Mind if I sit in, Lieutenant?
- lf you got the cubits, we've got the chair.
Of course if you've got anything to drink,
we'll take that in lieu of cash.
You know I don't have any money, but...
this jacket must be worth at least 15 cubits.
It's made of the finest Caprican cloth,
warm in winter, cooling in summer.
It'd look great on you.
Anybody else got any civilian clothes
they'd be interested in putting on the table?
Don't let me keep you.
Col. Tigh was right.
Rioting broke out on a cruise ship
when they reduced water rations.
We need to demonstrate an ability
to maintain order. We need to do it now.
We don't have extra manpower
for fleet security.
You have the only armed,
disciplined force available.
Yeah, but I'm not going to be
your policeman.
There's a reason why you separate
military and the police.
One fights the enemy of the state.
The other serves and protects the people.
When the military becomes both...
then the enemies of the state
tend to become the people.
I appreciate the complexity of the issue
and I won't let that happen.
- I'll send troops to the cruise ship.
- Commander, I won't let that happen.
- Beginning dradis one sweep.
- Beginning dradis two sweep.
So I'm thinking we should give
this lovely little rock of nothing a name.
- I'm thinking "Kimiko."
- "Kimiko"?
After a lovely little lady, in a lovely little city,
in a lovely little colony...
- that I used to know.
- Whatever.
Sorry. So sorry.
You had such a good run, though.
Looks like the bet's to me.
I'll try and muddle through
for another round.
I'm going to raise you five.
No guts, no glory, Doctor. I'll see your five...
and raise you 20.
Now it's just you and me.
I'm not used to playing
in this kind of high-stakes game.
It's not too late to bow out.
Now there's an excellent suggestion.
And before proceeding any further...
I should really examine my motivations
for doing so.
Staying in the game,
I run the risk of losing my entire stake...
and being humiliated
in front of these lovely people.
"Humiliated" is a such a strong word.
"Embarrassed" would be my choice.
You do play rough, don't you?
A little too rough for you.
My hand's not that strong. It wouldn't
take much to knock me out of the game.
Well, thank you, Doctor.
However, without a little risk...
life would be so dull, wouldn't it? Calling.
Three on a run.
Full colours.
Thank you all for a most pleasant evening.
A parting gift.
Hand-rolled from some
of the finest fumarello leaf in Caprica.
And it's also one of the last left
in the universe.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
Excuse me.
The Raptors have reported back
after three star systems.
- So far, all report negative for water, sir.
- I just checked with Astrometrics.
They're coming up with big goose eggs.
There's no star systems
within the range of our telescopes...
with planetary bodies
likely to have water on them.
Sir. Another Raptor just checked in.
Negative on water as well.
Who's left?
Boomer and Crashdown, sir.
If they come up negative as well...
what's our back-up plan?
We'll jump to another sector
and start the search all over again.
- Needle in a haystack.
- More like grain of salt on a beach.
Still nothing and...
more nothing.
I got nothing here, either.
Then that's it.
Five moons, five zeroes.
I'm getting thirsty just thinking about it.
Hope somebody else
has more luck out there.
Yeah.
What's on your mind,
Boomer?
I don't know. I have this feeling.
- Let's run that last sweep again.
- You're the boss.
- Beginning sweep 21.
- Beginning sweep 22.
Boomer,
I'm getting nothing again. How about you?
I'm having trouble saying it.
What do you mean?
I think I see...
Oh!
I have positive contact! Yeah!
Oh, yes! Yeah!
Good call, Boomer.
Sir. Dradis just picked up Boomer's Raptor.
Let's hear it.
Galactica, Crashdown.
Dradis sweeps indicate it's time
to break out the swimsuits...
because we've found water!
Repeat: Positive water contact!
Patch me in to the entire fleet.
You're connected, sir.
Attention. This is the commander.
We have found water!
Let's go have a drink.
I think they're pleased. I can hear them
screaming in the background.
Sharon, be careful with that needle.
We're running low
on anti-radiation medicine.
- Not really Mom's home cooking.
- Yeah? It beats eating grass and leaves.
We'll be cooking up a fine meal
of twigs and moss by the end of the week.
You spoil me.
Can I ask you something, Sharon?
Why'd you come back for me?
I hate to fly alone.
Come on. You disobeyed orders,
flew back into this hellhole...
and not that I don't appreciate it, but why?
I just couldn't leave you behind.
Let's leave it at that.
It's a Colonial Fleet signal.
I can't decode it,
but it means there's someone.
Someone in the military
is still alive and kicking here in Caprica.
Yes!
Now all we have to do is find them.
- Way to go, Boomer!
- Nice work, sir!
- Nice job. Let's get you debriefed.
- Yes, sir.
Chief. You think you could take a look
at my ejection pyros?
I think there's a short.
Yeah. Cally.
No, Chief.
You could take a look at it yourself.
Thank you for coming, Capt. Apollo.
I am aware that you were in charge...
of the mission
that destroyed the Olympic Carrier.
I know what a hard thing that is
to live with, for all of us.
I'm struggling
with it myself, frankly.
I can't stop thinking about it.
But a man has to accept responsibility
for his actions.
He doesn't second-guess
the choices he makes.
He lives with them. Every day.
You know, I remember when President Adar
sent the Marines into Aerilon.
Fifteen people died.
In public, of course,
he had to say all the usual things.
He was sure of what he'd done,
he made the right choice...
he stayed the course.
But he knew it was a mistake.
And he kept the names of the dead
in his desk drawer.
He said that it was imperative for a leader...
to remember and learn from the mistakes...
even if they can't admit to them publicly.
- You think we made a mistake?
- I don't know.
I don't have a desk drawer yet,
but I have a pocket.
I don't want to add
to your burdens, however.
I have a request. I would like you
to be my personal military advisor.
I'm sorry.
My father is the senior military officer.
He should advise you.
No, I don't mean to go
behind your father's back. Nothing like that.
I'm not looking for military advice.
I'm looking for advice about the military.
That little insight about your father
making a gesture, that really helped me.
It made me reassess the man.
I would appreciate more of those insights.
And you can keep your day job at the C-A-G.
It's pronounced "CAG."
Do you see why I need you?
So who's going to tell my father?
Well...
I was thinking that...
that would be your first assignment.
Somehow I knew you were going to say that.
Thank you, Captain.
Hey.
That is just what I needed.
Oh, yeah?
- Did you find that detonator?
- Yes, I did.
- I gave it to master-at-arms.
- What?
No, no.
I told her I found it during maintenance.
Listen, calm down.
This is the best way to go about this. Okay?
That puts them on the same trail we're on...
and it doesn't raise any suspicion of you.
Listen. Trust me on this, Sharon.
I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
Okay?
- Okay.
- All right, okay.
Don't worry, sweetie.
- I better go.
- All right.
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.
The captain of the Astral Queen
wants you to know...
he's got 1,500 prisoners under heavy guard.
Tell him I want daily reports
on the well-being of his prisoners.
The President has given me a direct order.
We're in the middle of a war...
and you're taking orders
from a schoolteacher?
Don't suppose there's a Plan B?
Plans B, C, D, E are the same as A.
Get off the planet and get back to the ship.
How much water did we lose?
Almost 60% of total potable water reserves.
If we don't find new supplies
they'll run out of water in two days.
Reveille,
morning stations aboard Battlestar Galactica.
All hands report to your stations.
So, what do we have?
Good news, Colonel.
We scouted the ice moon.
Found an entire subsurface ocean.
We've got reports and video for you.
Not exactly Caprica Beach
down there, Chief?
No, sir. We've registered temperatures
180 and below...
venting of methane and C02.
It's gonna be a bitch to work down there, sir.
Cheer up. You know how lucky we are
we found this ugly rock?
Water riots breaking out
all over the fleet. Civilians.
Whiney civie cry-babies can't stand
less than a hot shower every day.
Yes, sir.
Even Galactica's down
to 10,000 JPs of water.
Ever see a man die of dehydration?
No, sir.
Let's hope you never do. It isn't pretty.
So, where were we?
We drilled 23 core samples.
13% sodium chloride. What the hell?
We can't drink salt water!
No, sir. That's why I had Cally test the ice.
Well, there you go. Pure water.
Couple of lemons, we could make lemonade.
Yes, sir.
We'll have to melt the ice
before we transport it up to the ship.
What's that gonna take?
High-capacity heater expansion tanks,
D-25 plasma torches...
- Myrex hoses, centrifugal pumps.
- Sounds like a lot of manpower.
Ideally 1,000 men, sir.
One thousand men?
And where're they gonna come from?
Slave labour.
They are criminals. They've been sentenced
to hard labour. And this is very hard labour.
Not to mention physically dangerous.
This is not for civilians, but...
Their ship wasn't designed
for long-term incarceration.
These men have been stuck
in cramped cells for weeks now.
They might even prefer to get out.
Do something, even if it is dangerous.
If they volunteer. But these aren't slaves
and I will not have them treated as such.
No. We could offer incentives.
Points towards earning freedom.
Excuse me.
You wanna start releasing
hardened criminals into the fleet?
Sir, these men were on their way to Caprica
for parole hearings...
which at least implies
they may be ready for release.
- Make it happen, Captain.
- Yes, sir.
To address Commander Adama's
concerns, I'd like you to go along...
and set up a screening procedure
to weed out the hardened criminals.
I would like to have a representative
from Galactica...
who will report directly to me
about security issues.
How about D?
Second Class Petty Officer Dualla.
I know who she is.
I'm not sure she's conversant
with the technical details.
She'll be fine, but we should send someone
from ground crew...
who'll make sure the chosen men
know to use the equipment.
- Agreed.
- I have to get to the CIC. Excuse me.
Madam President? The doctor.
Excuse me?
The doctor?
Commander, do you have a ship's doctor
aboard Galactica?
- Maj. Cottle. Is there something wrong?
- No, nothing urgent. Allergies.
He's out on the fleet
checking medical conditions.
I'll tell him that you want to see him.
Thanks.
Petty Officer Dualla.
Conversant in technical details.
Thinking entirely of the mission.
Something on your mind, Captain?
I just thought maybe you had something
you wanted to say.
I have nothing to say to
the personal representative of the President.
I'm still Galactica's lead pilot.
I have nothing to say to him, either.
Every man has to decide for themselves
which side they're on.
I didn't know we were picking sides.
That's why you haven't picked one yet.
I'm a bus driver, not a warden.
How many total?
1,500.
They don't give me their files
or their names.
Hell, they're just numbers.
Thanks, Wilkens.
All right. They're all yours.
I'm Capt. Lee Adama,
personal representative of the President.
We're in a crisis.
Thousands of us are on the verge
of dying from dehydration.
The good news is we have found water.
The bad news is, it's located on a moon
with harsh environmental conditions.
We need 1,000 able-bodied men
to help us get that water.
President Roslin feels
that you represent our best chance.
She also recognises that you are not slaves.
Any man who volunteers to help us during
this emergency will earn "freedom points"...
which can be applied
toward earning his release.
We're offering you a chance
for a new beginning.
Whoever is interested,
please just step out of your cell.
Thank you for your offer.
We respectfully decline.
Zarek!
Oh, my God, that's Tom Zarek.
The terrorist?
Zarek!
So who the hell is Tom Zarek?
He's a freedom fighter.
- He's a prisoner of conscience.
- He's a butcher.
His colony was exploited
by the other 11 for centuries.
His people were marginalised, brutalised...
I'm from Saggitaron,
and that man doesn't speak for all of us.
He blew up a government building,
there's no excuse for that.
Captain, I've been watching the clock and
if we won't get any help, we should move on.
Zarek's got the prisoners united.
Let's go through Zarek.
Hello? Anybody out there?
Anybody wanna help two stranded pilots?
That's what I hate about big cities.
No one will help you.
No more shouting.
You're making me nervous.
Feel like I'm in a movie.
- At least it stopped raining.
- For now.
Where is everyone?
Some are dead. In their beds, at their desks.
Ones who weren't killed outright
probably ran into the hills.
Won't do any good.
- Guess I'm getting a little...
- Depressing? Morbid?
Sorry. Been here longer than you.
Wish I could say it gets easier.
There's more.
Boomer, you might not wanna...
Frakking rats. Let's go.
Come on.
Let's find a hospital,
score some anti-radiation meds, okay?
We've only got two days' worth left.
Sharon, we've made it this far.
We're gonna make it all the way.
- Right.
- Damn straight, all the way.
We're doing good, real good.
I guess someone must be
watching out for us.
She's good.
- So far.
- Jealous?
This all makes me makes so sad.
They would've destroyed themselves
anyway. They deserve what they got.
We're the children of humanity.
That makes them our parents, in a sense.
True. But parents have to die.
It's the only way children
come into their own.
No, that's not necessary.
I'd like to talk to you.
Guard. Prisoner 893893...
requests permission
to speak with his visitor.
Granted.
We're not allowed to speak
unless asked a direct question.
And you didn't ask me a direct question.
You've never been
in a prison before, have you, Captain?
No.
You're fortunate.
- May I sit down?
- Yes, of course.
We need these men of yours
to help us.
They're not my men. They belong to you.
I belong to you. You own us.
You're the master, we're the slaves.
You're clearly a man of principle.
I respect that.
Really?
The things you've stood for over the years,
the book you wrote.
The book that had to be smuggled
out of labour camp...
because stumps aren't allowed
freedom of expression?
I read it. In college.
Thought it was radical, challenging.
Made me question some things
I'd accepted before without thinking.
Nice to hear I'm a big hit on campus.
You weren't, the book was banned.
I read it anyway.
Point is, I understand
where you're coming from.
But I don't think you understand
how critical the situation is out there.
People are gonna start dying.
Hey, Starke. It's time for your break.
How can you say that?
It's the truth.
Zarek and the SFM,
they don't care about justice.
His people, your people
have been exploited.
- You can't tell me about my people.
- I'm not telling you about your people.
All I want, the President wants...
is to offer you a chance
to earn your freedom.
Now you've said the truth: freedom is earned.
Stay where you are, Captain.
It'll all be over soon.
Nobody try anything! Back up!
We've got the guards
and the crew in separate cells in Block 7.
Mason is looking after the hostages.
Nice job.
Everything's under control.
The men are organising exactly as planned.
I knew I could count on you.
Stay frosty there, Billy.
Everything's gonna be all right.
I don't know about that.
They don't wanna hurt us.
That won't get them what they want.
Which is what?
- Lt. Thrace. Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.
Really?
No.
Oh.
- I wonder if she's a real blonde.
- I doubt it.
Now, one of you has been
coming in a little hot lately.
A little too hot. A little... I don't know.
He's burning up the deck
with his skids because...
he can't pull back on the throttle.
Who is the speed demon, my prince?
Flat-Top, sir.
Flat-Top.
You got a need for speed, do you?
Can't wait to get back to the Big G
and the loving embrace of your fellow pilots?
Or maybe you have a hot date
with your right hand.
It never gets a headache.
Tell you what, Flat-Top,
you come in too hot today...
you may have to start using your left.
All right. You've been fun,
you've been a great audience. Dismissed.
There's no smoking in the ready room.
My room, my rules, sir.
- Where's your mummy?
- Dead. Where's yours?
- I'm looking for Boomer.
- 1400. Boomer's in the tool room.
A pilot blows his landings
and you make a joke out of it?
Screaming at people
doesn't always get the best results, sir.
I learned that at officer candidate school.
You are right on the edge, Thrace.
Careful you don't fall off.
Speaking of falling off...
glad to see you've found a way
to quench your thirst.
They won't negotiate
while you're holding hostages.
- I don't wanna negotiate.
- Then what do you want?
To be treated like men, not animals.
- Finally have something to bargain with.
- So what happens now?
- We're gonna talk.
- What about?
Your father.
- Is this a Monclair original?
- Yes.
Fantastic.
Would you like some water?
Yes, thank you.
I'm not a collector myself, but I...
I am familiar with his work, and may I say...
you really do have an excellent eye for art.
Thank you.
- Where's my Cylon detector, Doctor?
- Oh, that.
Yes, it's taking longer
than expected, unfortunately.
What's the hang-up?
It's not working this time, Gaius.
He can see right through you.
There are a number of obstacles...
none of them insurmountable,
but they do tend to slow us down.
For a start, the lack of proper facilities.
The water shortage, of course.
The water shortage, not to mention...
Cut the BS.
You said you had a way of detecting
human from Cylon.
Do you or don't you?
- I don't.
- What?
I don't think that I'm the man for this job.
I'm not cut out
for this kind of work.
- You have to do this.
- Why do I keep putting it off?
It's my subconscious telling me...
that I'm not the man for this job, please.
Listen to me.
If you don't tell him what he wants to hear...
he's going to find you out.
And when he does,
they're going to tear your head off...
and throw your body out of an air lock!
Pardon me.
I haven't had much sleep recently, so...
Unfortunately, Doctor, for both of us...
you're the last man we have.
So what's the game plan, Doc?
This is what you say:
"Commander, the truth is, there is one way."
- Say it!
- Commander, the truth is...
there is one way.
I didn't wanna have to ask you for this...
but what I really need
to complete the project...
is a nuclear...
warhead.
That how you got to be the
"personal representative of the President?"
Because of your father?
Hardly.
So, they don't get along, Adama and Roslin?
They have their differences.
But not when it comes
to dealing with terrorists.
I thought you said you respected me.
Read my book.
That was before you resorted
to violence and hostage-taking.
Always better when the oppressed
don't fight back, isn't it?
A warhead?
Technically,
I need the plutonium inside.
Technically, I need the plutonium inside.
Figure out the rest for yourself.
As you may know, the Cylons are...
susceptible to certain kinds of radiation...
and by taking the plutonium...
and embedding it
in a carbon nanotube matrix...
and it really is that simple...
I can construct a filter that will
preferentially ionise synthetic molecules...
and thus deliver to you your Cylons.
We have five warheads left aboard this ship.
We may need them.
Yes, of course.
If you really think that this project
has a low priority...
then you're totally within your bounds to...
You'll get your warhead.
Good boy.
Thank you, Commander.
Look, the master-at-arms
has been over every inch of that locker.
She's come up with nothing.
So they've got no idea
who took those six G-4 charges...
- or who put that detonator in...
- Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it, okay?
I need to speak with the Lieutenant, alone.
You don't honestly think
you've been fooling everyone, do you?
I know. The old man knows.
Hell, the whole ship
knows about you and the Chief.
It stops. Now.
Sir, the Chief and I are just friends.
When the ship was being decommissioned,
we let it go.
Hell, we let people get away with murder.
That was then and this is now.
We're at war, this is a combat unit
and you're his superior officer.
Put a stop to it. That's an order.
Yes, sir.
Attention.
Pass the word for Col. Tigh.
Col. Tigh, please report to the CIC.
The crew are
my prisoners. They will not be harmed.
Are you recording this?
Yes, sir.
What's this?
Trouble.
But I have
two conditions before I release my captives.
First, the government
which controls our fate...
is illegal and illegitimate...
and it must submit to the will of the people.
I demand the immediate resignation...
of Laura Roslin and her ministers.
Second, I demand free and open
elections to choose a new leadership.
And a new government
that represents all of the people.
These demands are made not for me
or the former slaves held on this ship...
but for you,
the people, the survivors of the holocaust...
and the children of humanity's future.
I am Tom Zarek...
and this is the first day of the new era.
- We've jammed his transmissions.
- A little bit late for that.
- Every ship in the fleet heard that broadcast.
- It doesn't matter.
It does matter.
He's trying to bring down the government.
No one'll take it seriously.
You have something to learn when
it comes to public opinion, Commander.
Tom Zarek is a name with weight. He's
a very sympathetic figure. A legend, almost.
Twenty years in prison
over a matter of principle.
He's a criminal and a terrorist.
People won't give him credence.
Don't be so sure, Commander.
Rebellions are contagious. People are
already rioting over the water crisis.
We can't afford
to destabilise this government right now.
I agree.
When are you going in?
I assumed you were gonna talk to him first.
- We don't negotiate with terrorists.
- I said talk.
There's nothing to talk about.
What he wants, I can't give him.
We're not ready yet. Talking to Zarek
gives us a little bit more time.
That's what he wants, legitimacy.
He wants to be recognised.
He wants his crimes validated.
I watched President Adar offer him
a full pardon if he'd apologise...
and give up violence
as a means of political change. He refused.
- No commitments. No deals.
- I'll let you know what happens.
Three assault teams:
Alpha, Bravo, Constellation.
We jam their dradis, the Raptors cut
through the hull here, here and here...
without being seen.
Once we're inside, Alpha takes...
What's this "we" crap?
- I'm going, sir.
- Like hell.
We have a few marines left on Galactica.
- Let them handle it, Starbuck.
- They don't have a sniper.
With all due respect, I'm the best shot
in or out of the cockpit.
She's right. For once.
Wonders never cease.
All right, you're going in.
You get a clear shot at Zarek, you take it.
I wanna control that ship immediately.
- And I want all the hostages alive.
- Yes, sir.
I don't even know how I drew this detail.
- President thought you'd be valuable.
- President doesn't know who I am.
I told her. Sorry.
On the other hand,
it's nice to get out of the CIC.
Break up the day, meet new people.
Yeah.
You're not asleep.
Not anymore.
Is that your way of telling us
you're not scared?
No, it's my way of telling you I'm tired.
- You don't know what tired is.
- Right.
Don't! Don't mock me, little girl.
I'm not mocking you.
Tom and I,
we go way back. Long time.
If you know what's good for you,
you'll be nice to me.
Frequent wireless contact.
Keep us informed all the way.
Yes, sir.
Good hunting.
Who voted for Laura Roslin? You?
Did you vote for her?
- She was sworn in under the law.
- The answer is, no one voted for her.
And yet she's making decisions
for all of us, deciding who lives...
and who dies. Is that democracy?
Is that a free society?
What is it you want from me?
You want me to say she shouldn't
be president? We need a government.
- We need rules, we need a leader.
- We need to be free men and women.
If we're not free,
then we're no different than Cylons.
They call you Apollo.
It's my call sign.
Apollo's one of the gods. A lord of Kobol.
You must be a very special man
to be called a god.
It's just a stupid nickname.
Son of Zeus, good with the bow,
god of the hunt...
and also a god of healing.
Now, a god...
can reconcile those two opposing forces,
but a mortal...
has to pick one side or the other.
Have you picked a side, Apollo?
Astral Queen, this is the Battlestar Galactica.
Commander Adama
wishes to speak to Mr. Zarek.
- Please respond.
- Zeus is calling.
Commander Adama?
Tom Zarek. How can I help you?
First, I want to make sure
that my people are unharmed.
This is Apollo. I'm fine, so are the others.
They're located on the lower...
That's enough, thank you.
I'm glad to hear that no one's been hurt.
That would have tragic consequences.
- How long until you storm the ship?
- I'm hoping that won't be necessary.
I think that you and I can come up
with some kind of understanding.
This is not the only crisis
that I'm dealing with.
The water shortage affects the entire fleet.
Your men are on their way even as we speak.
There's still time to work this out.
Have the President step down
and call for elections.
That's not gonna happen.
Then I look forward to meeting your men.
- I knew you were faking.
- I'm a light sleeper.
- I don't think I have your respect.
- I respect you.
Get up.
Hey, what's going on?
Hey!
- What are you doing?
- Move.
Where are you taking her?
It's okay, Cally. You're gonna be okay.
- They know where we are, Cally.
- Capt. Adama!
Hey! Capt. Adama!
- They're willing to talk.
- Sounded that way.
You want them to storm the ship.
Soft seal. Pressurised.
Eyes.
That's it, isn't it?
You don't want elections, you don't want
your freedom. You want a bloodbath.
You don't understand.
Tom Zarek's been out of the headlines,
out of the news...
forgotten for 20 years as he rots in a cell.
Now he's got a chance to go out
in a blaze of glory...
and he's gonna take it.
Alpha One, we're in.
Once Roslin uses Adama's soldiers...
to massacre the people on this ship...
prisoners and hostages alike...
people in the fleet will never forgive them.
The entire government will collapse.
- She can take care of herself.
- You sure?
She's been trained.
We've all been trained in capture, it's...
You've been saying
everything you're doing is for freedom.
But the truth is...
it's all about Tom Zarek
and his personal death wish.
Tom. Something's up.
Frakking bitch!
That's Mason. What the hell.
They're killing the hostages. Let's go.
Constellation Team, set.
Mason!
Mason, what're you doing?
- Bit my ear off.
- Frak you!
Open the door, she's been shot!
You said they weren't animals.
What do you call this?
Twenty years I've been waiting!
He's gonna kill her. Do something.
You did this! You put him in a cage!
You made him a monster!
Bravo, set.
You filthy bitch!
You all deserve to die!
You first.
All teams, sniper in position.
- He's gonna do it.
- You reap what you sow.
You look at me. You see me! Look at me!
Come on, Lee. Take out the son of a bitch.
How about it, Tom?
You still have a death wish?
You ready to leave this world,
right here, right now?
- Yes.
- Too bad.
'Cause this is what you're gonna do.
You're gonna tell your men
to help us get that water off the moon.
They're gonna work
for their points.
And they're gonna earn
their freedom. And then...
you're gonna get your elections.
- What?
- 'Cause you're right, Tom.
You are right about democracy
and consent of the people.
I believe in those things,
and we're gonna have them.
And you can have them, too.
Or you can have this bullet. Your call.
What are you doing, Lee? Come on.
How do I know your father...
and the President will honour your word?
You don't.
You let the rest of the hostages go,
we'll leave this ship in your hands.
They try and come after you,
you can still have your last stand.
It's your choice. You reap what you sow.
All right.
Lower your weapons.
Lower your weapons.
Do what he says.
Put them down.
Back off.
Cally, you're gonna be okay.
You just hang in there, you hear?
Got you.
Cease fire!
Don't shoot!
All teams, hold positions.
Frak.
- Thanks.
- I need a medic here.
God.
I don't believe this.
- It's unacceptable.
- It's done.
Prisoners have full control
of the Astral Queen.
We evac'ed all the guards
and support personnel. It's their ship.
- They're a threat to the entire fleet.
- They've been disarmed.
- The ship itself has no weapons.
- The ship itself is a weapon!
They're totally dependent on us
for food, fuel...
and they've agreed to organise the
workforce for the water detail on the moon.
You've committed me
to holding elections within a year.
Madam President, with respect...
you're serving out the remainder
of President Adar's term.
When that term is up in seven months,
the law says there's an election.
I only committed you to obeying the law.
- You were not authorised to make any deal.
- You sound like a lawyer.
I swore an oath to defend the articles.
The articles say there's an election
in seven months. If you're saying...
the law's out, then I'm not a captain,
you're not a commander...
and you are not the president.
And I don't owe either of you
a damned explanation for anything.
He's your son.
He's your advisor.
An election.
I guess you finally picked your side.
Madam President.
What the hell is this? Water?
Bet your ass.
There's plenty more where that came from.
I have my flaws, too.
The difference is, my flaws are personal,
yours are professional.
Thank you, Lieutenant. That'll be all.
Specialist Lazy, how are you feeling?
Must be nice...
lying around, doing nothing, as usual.
Sorry, Chief.
I didn't think you'd find me here.
I am so on to you.
Cally, is it true?
You really bite that guy's ear off?
He's lucky that's all I bit off.
That's my girl.
- I'm sorry, I can come back.
- No, it's all right. Come on in.
I just wanted to say goodbye
before I head back to Galactica.
And to tell you...
I hope you understand,
I wasn't being disloyal, Madam President.
I understand.
You're upholding the law. I admire it.
I believe in you. In what you're doing.
And for what it's worth,
seven months from now, you'll have my vote.
Could you sit?
There's something I need to tell you.
The truth is,
I might not be here in seven months.
- Are you planning a vacation?
- I wish.
I told your father that I...
had allergies, but I have cancer.
I found out
the morning of the attack.
I'm so sorry, Madam President.
I don't know what to say.
I understand.
I'm going to fight this,
but there is a great need for secrecy.
Of course.
Whether or not I survive this illness...
it is of great importance to me...
that there's a future for the people.
And I fear that knowledge
of my illness will erode hope.
So this has to stay between you and me.
- You can count on me.
- I know I can.
You're Capt. Apollo.
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.
Zak failed basic flight.
But he didn't because I passed him.
I can't decode it,
but it means there's someone.
Someone in the military
is still alive and kicking here in Caprica.
I have cancer.
And I fear that knowledge
of my illness will erode hope.
So this has to stay between you and me.
- Zak was my brother.
- What was he to me, nothing?
Same old Lee. You haven't changed either.
Helmet!
- You are so unprepared.
- Shut up!
You're the worst CAG in the history
of CAGs actually.
Raptor pilot
Lt. Dwight Flat-top Sanders...
entering hangar Deck 12 B.
Deck hands, please report.
Repeat, deck hands,
please report to 12 B.
There he is!
Way to go, Lieutenant!
Raptor Pilots flying high!
Raptor Pilots flying high!
- Red paint, incoming!
- Brush?
You're the worst. The absolute worst!
Here.
Raptor Pilots flying by!
Raptor Pilots flying by!
What the hell is this?
Flat-top's 1,000th landing and
nobody tells me. Now we look like idiots.
Find a wagon!
Yes, sir!
Somebody get me a wagon!
One, zero, zero.
You're not ready yet?
Someone's going to have to pick that up.
- Stop it!
- Let's go, come on.
This one is perfect. Take this.
Here, give me a hand.
Unload this. Put it wherever.
You two, come here.
Take this wagon to the palace.
Did the Commander tell you
what happened on his 1,000th landing?
- I don't remember telling you what I did.
- Whatever.
He's landing on the Atlantia...
and he's been having this ongoing fight
with the LSO...
and so he decides he'll stick it to him good.
This has all been over-exaggerated.
Come on, people, watch them bake
Three Little Cylons in the air
Three Little Cylons in the air.
Watch their metal burn and flare!
So, he skids to a stop on the flight deck...
and the LSO hears over the wire
there's this big, loud, long, obnoxious...
I was young.
It was great. It was really funny.
Two Little Cylons jump in their cave
Come on A-CARS make their grave!
The LSO is freaking out...
your dad doesn't care because
he hates the guy.
He figures he can get away with it
'cause it's his 1,000th landing.
"I can get away with anything today!"
Watch that tin can hit the spot!
Five Little Cylons in the grass
Watch the Raptor light their ass!
Attention!
Fire on the port hangar deck.
Away the fire and rescue team...
Let's go!
Metal fatigue, old equipment.
Worn strap fails, drops a million cubic drone
to the deck.
Kills 13 pilots and lands seven more
in sick bay.
It's hard to hear this,
but we got lucky.
If that had been a missile
instead of a cone drone...
it could've taken out the side of the ship.
Never had a death in my hangar deck.
Accidents. Never a death.
Services for the dead.
Services will commence
at 1100 hours on the forward hangar deck.
Mid-ship's hangar deck remains closed...
for investigation and clean up
until further notice.
Uniforms for the services will be
dress greys.
I wish I knew what to say,
words to make this better.
Can anything make this better?
I don't know.
Attention on deck!
As you were.
May I?
Yes, sir.
Are you Lt. Thrace?
Give me your eyes.
I know this has been a hard day.
There's been plenty of them lately.
I can guarantee you
there'll be more to come.
Remember your self-esteem.
Your self-respect.
And your self-worth.
Hold strong to them,
because people are watching.
You're the guardians of the fleet.
They need to know that they can
count on you.
Even at a time like this.
Are you Lt. Thrace?
I'm Cdr. Adama. Zak's father.
I know, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
I was planning on coming to see you
tomorrow before the funeral.
You don't need to explain anything.
Present arms!
Order arms!
Once again, we are charged
with the solemn duty...
to return the bodies of our own
to the universe...
from which the Lords of Kobol brought
them to us.
The burdens of this life are with us
but a short time.
For Lt. Zak Adama,
son of William and Caroline Adama...
brother of Lee, the time was too short.
But we take comfort in knowing
his life was willingly given...
in service to all of us.
We honour them for that.
And, thus, it falls upon us
to repent our sins...
and with the help of the Lords of Kobol...
make our own lives worthy of that gift.
And now, we commit his body
to the ground from which we were all made.
Secure in the knowledge...
that we will be reunited with them...
in a better world to come.
So say we all.
So say we all.
Present arms!
Pilots we've known.
I have to start training new pilots.
There it is.
I kind of thought this was about that.
I don't know if I'm the right person for this.
- Do you know someone better?
- No.
But there's almost 50,000 people out there.
Trying to tell me there's not one
flight instructor?
There's two. Civilians. Both.
But I need someone
to teach combat tactics.
You know, I don't know
if I'd be of any use to you.
- I wasn't the most patient.
- Let's get down to it.
This is about Zak.
It was not your fault.
You had nothing to do with what happened.
It was an accident.
Lee? Zak failed basic flight.
- What?
- Or at least he should have, but he didn't...
because I passed him.
His technique was sloppy
and he had no feel for flying...
but I passed him.
Because he and I...
Because I felt something and I let it
get in the way of doing my job.
And I couldn't fail him.
Zak passed basic flight.
He was trained
and ready to sit in that cockpit.
What happened to him could've happened
to any qualified pilot.
- You know that's true.
- Right.
You did your job to the best of your ability.
That's all I can ask.
I need new pilots.
And I want you to train them.
I can do that.
Just give them the attention and
the professionalism that you gave my son.
And they'll be one hell of a squadron.
Ten cubits says she takes him this time.
You're on.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Ten to stay.
So, Gaeta, how are you and the Doc here
doing on your Cylon detector?
What Cylon detector?
Rumour has it
that Cylons look like people...
and you guys are working on a way
to weed them out, right?
I want you to tell me the truth
about something.
You passed.
By the skin of your teeth, but you passed.
I don't want any special treatment.
Not from my father...
and certainly not from you.
If there were such a programme,
it would be classified...
and I wouldn't be able to talk about it.
Something smells horrible in here.
Is that you, Crashdown?
Yeah, that's me.
Your card.
Your card.
Zak, I'm a flight instructor.
I'm not going to send you to Vipers
if I don't think you got the chops. Okay?
Hello? Are you all right?
Look...
Maybe you'd like to take a break?
I'm out of here.
Starbuck?
Okay, she can't do that.
She can and she did.
This is it.
Restaurant.
I'm almost on top of the signal.
I don't get it.
How does a military coded signal
end up coming from in here?
Let's find out.
Nothing. Is that thing working?
I checked it three times.
This thing says
we're right on top of it.
Of what?
What?
Helo.
You're frackking kidding me.
Food. Medical supplies.
Wait a minute, the signal.
Disaster beacon.
It's been set to go off if there was an attack.
Some poor slob goes to all the trouble
of building a fallout shelter, stocks it...
has a beacon, the whole planet...
Then what? What happens to him?
Let's just call ourselves lucky
and leave it at that.
- Madame President.
- Would you close that curtain, please?
Thank you.
You are obviously an intelligent,
well-educated young woman.
Would you mind explaining to me why
you waited five years...
in between breast exams?
Yes, I would mind.
It's none of your business.
I was busy.
- And now, here you are.
- Yes. Here we are.
- Would you mind?
- I do, actually.
Your doctor back on Caprica was right.
It's too damn late to operate,
the cancer is too far advanced.
We can try to shrink
the tumour with gamma treatments...
and follow that up with IV cis-Doloxan.
Did he explain to you the side-effects
of Doloxan?
Hair loss, nausea, muscle degeneration.
I watched my mother endure two years
of Doloxan before she died.
I would like to explore alternate treatment.
Prayer?
Witty.
Have you ever heard of Chamalla extract?
Gods. You're one of those.
What if it works?
All the evidence on Chamalla is anecdotal.
It's nothing but a bunch
of loose talk and false hope.
I'll take that as a yes.
All right.
I'll put out a med request
to the civilian fleet.
Maybe there's some other wide-eyed dreamer
out there...
with a secret horde of Chamalla extract
in their luggage.
Put your clothes back on now.
Thank you.
And for what it's worth...
I would seriously consider prayer.
Boonie jumpers. Shuttle jockies.
And a Fleet Academy wash-out. This is
the best that you could come up with?
- Diamonds in the rough.
- Yeah, right.
They're the most qualified pilots
in the fleet.
Great!
Attention on deck.
That means get on your feet, nuggets!
You are joining the Colonial Fleet,
boys and girls, not some after-school club.
Seats.
Pilots call me Starbuck,
but you may refer to me as God.
You've all flown before, but you're about
to enter a whole new world...
so pay attention.
We don't have any flight simulators
on board...
so we're putting you into the cockpit, today.
This is the Viper Mark II.
It's as manoeuvrable as a jack-rabbit,
and can flip end for end...
in 0.35 seconds.
You've never flown anything remotely like it,
so don't think that you have.
Today we'll do basic launch,
approach, and landing manoeuvres...
and anyone not paying attention
is liable to end up...
as a puddle or something to be hosed
out of the cockpit by the chief of the deck.
She's laying it on a little thick.
Costanza, right?
Yes, God, sir.
Not anymore.
From now on, your name is "Hot Dog."
And when God speaks, Hot Dog, you listen.
Maybe if you had learned that at
the Academy, you wouldn't have washed out.
Sit up!
Viper 791 Galactica,
you are cleared for approach.
Speed 175 port bay,
hands on approach...
checkers green. Call the ball.
I have the ball.
Easy on the throttle, Kat.
Are you listening to me?
Don't chase the lights, okay?
Roger, Starbuck.
Kat, don't chase the lights!
Set it by the numbers
and correct with thrusters.
Wave-off!
Punch it, Kat!
Worse than awful.
Wretched beyond belief, actually.
You call yourselves pilots.
It'll take the knuckle draggers a week to
pound your divots out of the flight deck.
- With due respect, sir, that's unfair.
- Yes, sir. This was only our first day.
No. It's your last.
It would be criminal to let any of you
near a Viper again.
So pack your gear and
get the hell off my ship. You're done.
What are you doing here, Kara?
- You can't wash them out on their first day.
- I just did.
Look, I got 40 Vipers, and 21 pilots.
That's it.
We are sitting ducks
until we finish water-op's.
We can't even maintain a CAP.
And Gods forbid the Cylons show up.
Gods forbid.
Let's bring in the next group of candidates.
The next group has never even been
in a cockpit.
- They're starting basic flight.
- Then they start basic flight.
Because that group is done.
It says so right there.
Maybe you should read it again.
Lt. Thrace, this is not a request.
Well, Capt. Adama!
I am the flight instructor, sir.
My word is scripture, sir.
I will not, repeat, not pass
another student who isn't ready.
So, that's what this is about.
It's not them. It's Zak.
Careful.
Step back.
Starbuck says they can't cut it,
they can't cut it.
She's not giving them a chance. It's Day 1.
She's one of the finest pilots
I've ever seen in my life.
One day in the cockpit is all she needs
to know if they can hack it or not.
She got that.
I'm not arguing that, sir.
I'm just saying that I think she's letting her
personal feelings cloud her judgment.
Please sit down, Captain.
What are those feelings?
About Zak.
- We've talked about, Zak.
- You did?
We've talked about a lot of things.
We've been aboard this ship for over
two years. We know each other very well.
When I asked her to be the instructor...
I knew it was going to release
a lot of loose baggage.
She acknowledged it.
She's a professional. She'll do her job.
Okay.
I'm just saying that you should talk to her.
She's walking around
with a lot of emotion.
She almost decked me in the rec room.
Right. You wouldn't smile if you were there.
- I'll talk to her.
- Thank you.
Personally...
I think she's trying to work out her guilt
over what she did for Zak.
I think she's making up for it
by beating up on these guys.
Guilt? Over what?
What did she do for Zak?
- I thought you just said...
- What did she do?
It's not my place to say and I've already said
more than I should have.
- You'll have to ask her. I'm sorry.
- Captain, just...
Dad, you'll have to ask her.
I don't want any special treatment.
Not from my father,
and certainly not from you.
You passed.
By the skin of your teeth, but you passed.
Attention.
Pass the word to Lt. Thrace.
Lt. Thrace, please report
to the CO's quarters.
Yes. Come in.
Lee was just here before.
I knew it.
He thinks you washed out...
the nuggets without giving them a chance.
They didn't cut it. That's it.
He thought you were letting
personal feelings cloud your judgment.
Really?
Your feelings about Zak.
That's not the case.
Okay.
He said something else.
He said something that
I would like to ask you directly.
He said that you might be feeling
guilty about something that you did for Zak.
What did you do for him?
I don't know. Ask Lee.
I'm asking you.
I don't know...
I don't really know
what he was talking about, so...
Don't fence with me, Kara.
I love you like a daughter.
I don't deserve that.
Zak failed basic flight.
He wasn't a bad pilot.
He just had no feel for flying.
And when it came to his final check-ride,
he busted...
three of the test manoeuvres.
And I should have flunked him, but I didn't.
The bottom line is that your son...
didn't have the chops to fly a Viper.
And it killed him.
He told me that you were
an amazing instructor.
And that he was involved with you,
and that it was serious.
He asked me to come to his graduation
from flight school...
- to watch him get his wings.
- I know. I read the letter.
I see.
Then, maybe you can tell me
what he was hinting at.
Surprise, about you.
We were going to...
You know what, it's not important.
- I don't want that to...
- You were engaged, right?
You did it because you were engaged.
Because I made a mistake.
And because I was just...
I was so in love with him.
And I let that get in the way of doing my job.
He just wanted it so much and I didn't want
to be the one who crushed him.
Reinstate the trainees to flight status.
I will.
- I just want you to understand that I...
- Do your job.
Yes, sir.
And walk out of this cabin
while you still can.
Unpack your gear.
You are all returned to flight status.
We're going to try this again.
Those of you who can be trained to safely fly
the Viper Mark II will pass.
Those of you who cannot, will be cut.
It's my job to figure out which
is which, without personal feeling either way.
And I'm going to do my job.
Kat, Chuckles, Hot Dog, you're up first.
Pre-flight briefing in 20 minutes.
Where the hell
are you going, Hot Dog? Stay on me.
Target acquired and destroyed.
Not bad, Hot Dog,
but you left your leader behind.
Looks like you're having a bad day,
Hot Dog.
- And the moral of this story is?
- Never leave your leader.
Thank you. That is correct.
You never want to be out here alone.
Okay, Chuckles, take Kat's wing.
Hot Dog, you're on me.
We'll try a little manoeuvre called
"Thorch Weave."
I'll be damned. What's got into Starbuck?
She actually sounds like
a real instructor for a change.
She may actually make Viper pilots
out of some of those nuggets after all.
Holy crap, we've got incoming.
Where the hell did they come from?
Dradis. Multiple contacts.
It's the Cylons.
Why didn't we see them coming?
Launch the alert fighters.
Attention! Set Condition 1
throughout the fleet.
Galactica, send the Calvary.
Nuggets, punch it for home.
Where's the base ship?
No base ships detected, sir.
Eight raiders, bearing 047
carom 118. Range 22,000.
They found us. It was only a matter of time.
Galactica, Starbuck.
Where the hell are the alert fighters?
Starbuck, Alert One.
Be there in two minutes.
The Cylons are gaining!
All right, listen up, nuggets.
Stay together and keep your throttles
firewalled until you hit the deck.
Now, go.
What's she doing?
Starbuck's gonna take on all eight.
And get herself killed.
Hot Dog, where are you going?
Hot Dog, what are you doing?
Got one!
Hot Dog! Get out of here!
Hot Dog, I told you
to get your ass home!
You said never
to leave your leader.
I also said
never to disobey an order.
- I'm hit!
- I got you, Hot Dog!
We're going to make it through this.
Break right. Now!
She'll make it.
I just lost all three mains.
It's all right, Hot Dog. You did good.
We're gonna be okay, I promise you.
At least one of us will.
That about does it.
I think there's only one left.
Frack!
He's right on my tail,
but I got it covered.
Starbuck's wireless and transponder
just cut out.
Alert One, we spotted Hot Dog.
No ID or visual on Starbuck.
Frack me!
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.
Zak failed basic flight.
And I should have flunked him, but I didn't.
The bottom line is that I killed him.
Walk out of this cabin
while you still can.
I don't get it.
How does a military coded signal
end up coming from in here?
Food.
It's the Cylons.
Starbuck's wireless and transponder
just cut out.
Starbuck's gonna take on all eight.
And get herself killed.
Galactica. Hot Dog's aboard.
Yeah, so is his lunch.
Take it easy, Hot Dog.
You're not the first to lose it in combat.
You won't be the last.
No sign of Starbuck.
He says she was hit but still in the fight
when he lost track of her.
Roger that. Search and rescue ops
are underway for Starbuck.
Bring Hot Dog in.
The old man wants to talk to him.
This is where you found him?
Yes, sir,
he drifted quite a ways from the fight.
Was she manoeuvring?
I think so. Yes. Yes, sir.
So she survived the initial hits.
She could still be alive.
She is alive, Lieutenant.
We're gonna find her.
Yes, sir.
Get this man to sick bay.
Yes, sir.
I think you earned those today.
The auxiliary RT switch sticks a little, sir,
but she'll fly.
- Polish up the canopy. I want it crystal clear.
- Yes, sir.
- Find her.
- I will.
Still no joy from the search teams.
In the last four hours
we've combed everywhere...
in a 200 click sphere
around Starbuck's last known position.
No ship, no ejection seat, no debris.
So we're extending the radius another 50.
- We need more pilots.
- Everybody who can fly is up, sir.
What about Starbuck's course computations?
The variables of combat manoeuvring
make them almost meaningless.
- It's time to start guessing.
- Yes, sir.
Since there's been no dradis contact
in the area...
I would have to guess that her Viper was
captured by the gravity of a planetary body.
The only nearby gravity wells
are the gas giant and this moon.
If the gas giant pulled her in,
its radiation would fry her like an egg.
What about the moon?
The spectroscope people call the atmosphere
as CO2, methane, some argon.
The clouds are mostly hydrocarbons.
Cold as hell down there,
but she'd survive on the surface.
- Until her oxygen runs out.
- When?
Forty-six hours and change, sir.
Hell of a long time to stay in one place.
- What if the Cylons appear?
- They won't, not for a while.
What makes you say that?
Sending a patrol instead of the base ship
tells me they didn't even know we were here.
So they're searching a lot of other places,
places with potential supplies.
Like staking out water holes in the desert.
If we sent eight fighters
to search an entire star system...
for 60-odd ships, it would take us weeks...
Assume they're better and faster.
It'll take them days.
- A lot of assumptions you're making.
- Educated guess.
- Talk to me about searching the moon.
- That's going to be slow going.
We can't see squat through those clouds.
Send the ships below the cloud cover.
Tell the pilots to take a hard look
the old-fashioned way.
Mark One Eyeball, sir?
Mark One Eyeball.
Commander, call from Colonial One.
Adama.
Commander Adama, I don't wanna take
much of your time.
I wanted to say how happy we all are
you found one of your pilots.
Thank you, Madam President.
How is the search progressing
for the other pilot?
Nothing yet, but we've just begun.
I've spoken
with the other captains in the fleet.
They've agreed to give over their ships
at your disposal...
if it'll increase the odds of finding her.
Frack the odds.
We're going to find her.
Excuse me. Thank you.
Tell them we could sure use the help.
I'll coordinate their efforts with your CIC.
Continued good luck.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So it looks like
we're going to be staying here for a while.
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine, it's just a...
How long you think it will be
before the Cylons wonder what happened...
to their missing patrol,
and send another one here to look for it?
You have attacked us hundreds of times.
We're still here.
I think you'll find that we are
more than adequately protected.
Might be a little tricky with the fleet
scattered over half this system...
Iooking for the lost pilot.
How many days till the Cylons return,
Gaius?
One?
Two?
Three at the most?
Doctor?
Your requisitions.
Thank you.
Madam President,
I don't mean to be impertinent, really, but...
do you honestly think this is wise?
You are compromising the security
of the entire fleet...
while we search for one solitary pilot.
It is a risk, but those pilots put their lives
on the line for us every day.
Yes. I was just saying that, to...
I'm not insensitive,
that is what I'm saying.
I happen to know
the missing pilot personally.
Not as personally as you'd like.
Guess you'll never find out
if she's a real blonde.
It's all the more difficult for me.
On one hand I think of the pilot.
And on the other hand
I think of the thousands of defenceless...
women and children.
I meant, throughout the fleet.
I am sure Commander Adama
has considered all of this.
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Yes, of course he has.
Of course he has. Thank you.
It's okay.
Okay, get to higher ground.
Then they see you. Then they rescue you.
Apollo, Galactica, we are being bounced
around like beach balls down here.
Visibility about two, best spectrum.
Copy, Apollo.
Blue! Blue flight, go vertical now!
- Anything?
- No.
- I don't think anyone's left out there.
- Must be someone.
We can't be the only two people
left in the world.
Good news is my leg's much better...
and we've got anti-radiation meds
to last three months.
I say we load up
as much food as we can and...
Move out.
Try to find a Raptor or a transport
or something we can fly off Caprica.
Unless you can think of a reason to stay.
Not really looking forward
to going back out there.
I've almost started to think
of this place as...
home.
Home.
No, sleep a little longer.
Who knows when we'll find
clean sheets again.
I'm going to go topside
and make some breakfast.
Breakfast.
Hey, is breakfast ready?
Get out of here! Go!
Lords, it's Kara Thrace.
I'm running a little low on O2
and I could use a lucky break.
You know? Okay, just thought I'd mention it.
Not bad shooting, if I do say so myself.
Lords, I owe you one.
Looks like I found my ride out of here.
If I can fix you up.
Galactica, Apollo. Bingo fuel.
Roger, Apollo. Return to base.
Can't you tank me in orbit?
Negative, Apollo.
The tankers are refilling.
You'll be dry before they can launch.
Are these figures correct?
Yes, sir.
Atmospheric ops mean Viper
and Raptor engines run continuously.
Fuel's going to be a real problem
if we keep it up.
Any report from the civilian ships?
Nothing. They're spread pretty far out.
We'll have a hell of a time trying
to cover them if the Cylons pop in.
We should consider pulling the civvies
into a defensible formation.
No. Keep all the ships on the search.
We've left enough people behind.
I don't wanna leave Starbuck behind.
- Committing the entire fleet to this...
- I said no!
We are going to find our missing pilot
and we're going to bring her home.
We leave no one behind.
Resume your duties.
Sharon?
Sharon, where are you?
Damn it, Sharon, where are you?
Sharon!
Frack me.
Are you alive?
What the hell happened this time, Captain?
I hit the roll thrusters to level off
for set down but only the left one fired.
It's that crap you're flying into down there.
Gums everything up.
Get me another Viper.
Love to, but this is 13 Vipers
that are down, plus your Mark VII. I'm out.
I've got a pilot down
and I need another Viper now.
I realise that, Captain.
But you can push people a lot further
than machines.
I'm the CAG, you're the Chief.
Just make it happen.
Commander, the clock has passed
five hours, sir, for Starbuck's O2 supply.
Noted.
Here's the photo mosaic
for the area we searched so far.
We've got to do better than this.
Can't see far
when you're hugging the ground.
You can't see anything from altitude.
Not to mention the crap in the air
that keeps screwing up our ships.
Thirteen Vipers down for repairs.
We need more eyes.
Where we going to get them?
Pull the CAP.
What?
Redeploy the Combat Air Patrol
to the search.
Bad idea. The CAP is the fleet's only defence.
If all Vipers are fracking around
on the moon...
when the Cylons come calling,
we're maggot meat.
Then bring the fleet closer to the moon.
We can always scramble the Vipers
from the search to meet any attack.
Bottom line: we can double the area
we can search in the time we have left.
Starbuck would be the first one to tell you
not to do this.
Nothing would make you happier, would it?
Leave her behind.
Get rid of the foul-mouthed insubordinate
pilot that keeps challenging your authority.
You are way out of line. I'm not the one
confusing personal feelings with duty.
What the hell does that mean?
You are way too close to this
because she's your friend.
Gentlemen!
We have work to do. Captain.
Get as many birds up in the air as you can
and you find our girl.
You got it.
Oh, my gods.
You bite me, I'll bite you back.
So I guess
the only thing flying you is you.
This must be your brain.
I don't think you'll need it.
Good thing that I brought one of my own.
Even cockroaches have to breathe.
How the hell do you?
Captain. Call for you, sir.
Can someone finish this up for me?
Where is it?
That way.
Yeah, Apollo.
Hold for President Roslin.
How're you holding up?
Better than my Viper. We're slapping
one together from pieces of the others.
I need your help.
Did you know that your father
just redeployed the Combat Air Patrol?
- Yes, Madam President. It was my idea.
- Your idea?
We need every Viper we've got.
Maybe I'm missing something
about the tactics involved.
But isn't the fleet defenceless
without the CAP?
Only for a short time.
Because after that, Kara's oxygen
will be gone and she'll be dead.
Are you very close with Lt. Thrace?
I'm close with all my pilots.
And I assume
the same is true for your father?
His pilots mean a lot to him. To all of us.
We don't leave anyone behind.
But we have left people behind.
You know that.
Not this time.
Your FTL drive should be spun up and ready.
Just make sure everyone is set to jump
at the first sign of trouble.
With all due respect, Captain...
there are times when it is necessary
for the safety of the fleet to put...
Not this time.
We just haven't exhausted all the options...
and the safety of the fleet
has not been compromised.
- I hope you find her.
- Thank you.
Blue flight reports bingo fuel, sir.
Have them stay on the search.
Send the tanker to them.
Is there a problem, Mr. Gaeta?
It's just that trying to tank in that turbulence,
sir, will be extremely hairy.
I suggest we wait
until the clock has run down...
and then tank up
on the way back to Galactica.
Did someone call them back to Galactica?
- I just assumed...
- The search was over? It was hopeless?
That we should write Starbuck off as dead?
- Is that what you're telling me, Mr. Gaeta?
- No, sir.
Then what are you trying to tell me,
Mr. Gaeta?
- You have your orders.
- Yes, sir.
Time is up. She's out of O2.
The clock is a guess.
We don't know for a fact
that Starbuck is out of air.
Her tank only holds so much oxygen.
She could have a reserve supply
in her survival gear.
A reserve?
Yes.
What, she just happened to pack
an extra bottle today?
It's possible.
We are putting people at risk.
- We have pilots out there...
- We are not quitting.
...pushing themselves, their ships
too hard, all for the sake of...
We are not quitting
and you are relieved, Colonel.
I stand relieved, sir.
Come on, you're part biological, right?
Which means you need oxygen, right?
So it's got to be here, somewhere.
Commander, the President.
Adama.
Commander Adama, I just wanted to say
how very sorry I am about Lt. Thrace.
Please give my condolences to your son
and to the rest of the crew.
Excuse me, Madam,
but I think you've been misinformed.
- How?
- We don't know if Starbuck's dead.
I was told that her oxygen
had run out a half an hour ago.
That's an estimate.
She may have a reserve supply.
We'll continue the search as long as
there's a chance she may be alive.
And how long will that be?
Until I say stop.
This is a military decision,
Madam President.
Thank you for your concern.
First on the list, seal you up...
figure out what controls what.
One of us needs a bath.
Now you're going to teach me how to fly.
Red Flight reports an area of highlands here.
- Increased visibility out to 15 clicks maybe.
- It's the wrong side of the moon.
Commander...
Almost impossible to...
We have a signal
from Colonial One's shuttle.
They request permission to land.
The President's on board.
Why wasn't I notified
the President was coming onboard?
There was no advance notice, sir.
I didn't know she was coming.
Let's go.
Have Col. Tigh meet her
at the airlock.
Bring her to my quarters, please.
Very well.
Every flying machine has four basic controls:
power, pitch, yaw, and roll.
Where are yours?
Safety tip number one: don't touch that.
Are you going to order us
to stop the search?
I came here to talk, not to give orders.
- It may take an order.
- Why?
Col. Tigh, do I need to know something?
It's gone beyond military needs.
It's personal for the Commander and Lee.
Because of Lt. Thrace?
Because of her, and because of Zak Adama.
The Commander's dead son.
It's complicated.
Take about three weeks to explain.
We've got about three minutes. Talk fast.
She's going to press.
I'm with you.
President Roslin.
Madam President.
Skip the formalities.
You both know why I'm here.
Termination of a pilot's rescue mission
is a military decision.
That's a bunch of crap.
This isn't military, it's personal.
Neither of you can let go of Kara Thrace
because she's your last link to Zak.
- You don't know anything about my brother.
- Don't even begin, Captain.
You've lost perspective. As have you.
Under normal circumstances
it would just be sad...
that you two can't come to terms
with Zak's death.
In this situation
you're putting your pilots at risk.
You're exposing the fleet to possible attack
every moment we stay here.
We've been at risk of an attack since day one.
The Cylons won't be missing
their patrol for at least one more day.
Col. Tigh, how much aviation fuel
has been expended in this operation?
Forty-three percent of reserves.
Almost half. That's unacceptable.
Operations in the moon's atmosphere have
put one third of your fighters out of action.
That is also completely unacceptable.
Crap. Unacceptable.
Whatever it is you feel about this...
the recovery of one pilot is a military matter.
All right. It's military. Fine.
And you're both officers.
And you're both honourable men.
You're both perfectly aware
that you are putting the lives...
of over 45,000 people
and the future of this civilisation at risk...
for your personal feelings.
Now if the two of you, of all people,
can live with that...
then the human race doesn't stand a chance.
Clear your heads.
Combat. Stand-by.
This is the Commander.
Terminate search operations.
Bring everyone home.
Prepare the fleet to make a jump
to the next system. We're leaving.
Okay, so it either works or it doesn't.
Okay, it's power, roll, pitch, and yaw.
We have control. Take me home.
You stink,
but you're one hell of a flying machine.
I want you to know, I think she's wrong.
I think we have come to terms
with what happened to Zak.
I haven't.
I need to know something.
Why did you do this? Why did we do this?
Is it for Kara? For Zak? For what?
Kara was family.
You do whatever you have to do.
Sometimes you break the rules.
- And if it was me down there instead?
- You don't have to ask that.
Are you sure?
If it were you...
we'd never leave.
Colonel.
Commander.
- Resume your duties.
- Sir, fighters are aboard, sir.
Civilian ships have begun their jumps
to the next star system.
Give the word, we'll start our clock.
Start the clock.
Mr. Gaeta, start the clock.
Starting clock.
Madam President,
would you like to return to your ship?
Thank you, I'll stay here.
I'd like to see how the professionals do it.
As you wish.
- Execute jump, Lt. Gaeta.
- Aye, sir. Jump clock is running.
Navigation?
Go.
FTL?
Go.
Tactical?
Go.
Flight Ops?
Contact. Dradis contact.
Incoming, bearing 060, carom 308.
- Hold count.
- Count held.
Contact is...
Hold the count.
Well?
- Cylon Raider, sir.
- You're right. It's just a matter of time.
He's on an intercept course. He'll be on us
before we complete the jump.
Action stations, launch Vipers.
Action stations. Launch
alert, Vipers. Cylon Raider approaching.
Now look
before you shoot, please.
Gun captains report
weapons manned and ready.
Where the hell are the Vipers?
Most are being fuelled.
Hot Dog and Apollo
are in the tubes.
Viper I, clear forward.
Navcon Green, interval failure. Abort launch.
Frack!
I guess I'm going solo.
Why only one Cylon this time?
It could be a lone recon mission...
or the vanguard for a Cylon base ship
about to jump on top of us.
Either way, we're going to have
to take it out before we can jump.
Galactica, Apollo. Target in sight.
You idiot. Didn't anybody teach you
intercept protocol?
Okay, we're going to have
to do this the hard way then.
This bastard's good.
They're closing fast.
Port guns have a firing solution.
Very well.
- Hold still, you little...
- No cigar for you.
Just come a little bit closer.
Not that close!
What the...
I've lost him.
Galactica, I repeat, he is nowhere to be seen.
- Dradis.
- No help. Their reports have merged.
Launch tube status?
Still fouled.
- We'll have a Viper away in 45 seconds.
- This will be over in 45 seconds.
Holy...
Galactica, the Cylon is now flying
in formation with me...
right above my head.
This thing is acting weird.
Put me through.
It's Starbuck!
What?
Come again, Apollo.
Galactica, the Cylon Raider
is marked "Starbuck."
It's written under the fracking wing.
Bring it into the bay.
If it does anything, take it out.
Wilco, Galactica,
but I tell you what, it's got to be her.
This thing is flying
with some serious attitude.
Now your ass belongs to me.
Like my new toy?
Boy, when you take a souvenir,
you don't screw around.
- Oh, my God, you smell like a latrine.
- You want to give me a bath?
- How're you feeling?
- Been a hell of a lot worse.
Don't have any ambrosia, but the Doc...
can fix you up with some really nice stuff.
It's not bad, is it? The knee?
Doc says it's too early to tell,
but knowing you, you'll be fine.
- Kara.
- Yeah?
You did good.
Get better, okay?
- Need anything?
- A stogie would be nice.
I had a feeling.
- It's my last one, so enjoy it.
- Thank you.
Get some rest.
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica:
Sharon, get out of here!
Where are you? Sharon!
Halt! No sudden moves.
Get on your knees
and cross your ankles. Now!
I'm human. I'm from Oasis.
It's a hamlet, public stop.
I'm out of Havoca City.
I'm not a Cylon!
Don't leave me!
Attention, the Scorpia Traveller
has docked.
Any civilians currently boarding Galactica
please proceed to security checkpoint.
Thank you.
Flight Maintenance Crew Bravo
report to Flight 3.
Next.
Next.
Yes, okay.
It's all clear?
I've got your back, Chief.
Thanks.
- Anybody see you?
- No.
I went through the hatch combing
on C Causeway.
Good girl.
Bravo team, EOD,
stand by for munitions off-loading.
Hangar Bay 2.
You know, sometimes at work...
I try to conjure up what your face looks like.
The curve of your lips...
the way your hair falls, how you smell.
You see my face every day.
Yeah, but not like this.
Security, XO.
Send an armed detail to meet me...
in the midpoint promenade deck causeway,
C level. Approach from the aft.
Repeat. Approach from the aft.
Doral!
What's the count?
- Three dead. 13 injured.
- Did you get a good look at the bomber?
- Yes.
- It was him, right?
Yes.
I want to see the Master at Arms
in my office in ten minutes.
A Cylon?
Eyewitness accounts state
the bomber was a man.
The Cylons look like us now.
Like us?
Yes, they appear human.
The flesh, the blood...
the whole thing.
The bomber was another copy
of a man we knew as Doral...
posing as the Public Relations Officer
aboard this ship.
They've learned that there are
multiple versions of the same Cylon.
I want you to open
an investigation immediately.
I want to find out how that Cylon
or any civilian...
- could break through our security.
- There's been a string...
of security incidents aboard ship, sir.
The water tank explosion, the discovery
of explosives aboard a Raptor...
- and now this.
- Your point?
I need a free hand.
The authority to follow evidence
wherever it might lead...
without command review.
- Independent tribunal?
- Yes, sir.
You'll get it.
Thank you.
That will be all, Sergeant.
I also strongly recommend
alerting the public to the Cylon threat.
If there are other copies of this man
aboard the fleet...
we should find them
before they strike again.
I'll take that under advisement.
That will be all.
Yes, sir.
Open to the public. There's a can of worms.
Keeping silent hasn't helped us very much.
Maybe shining a light on the situation
will make things pop up.
All right.
Hey.
I owe you one.
- Sir.
- Colonel.
Get me the President.
Don't kink the line.
There, we've got it.
Okay, let's go.
So who's first?
How about me?
- Hey, Chief.
- How's it going there, on top?
- Hi.
- Come on. Let's have it. Come on.
You people are
the sorriest of the sorry.
The dumbest of the dumb.
The only thing
you're making out of this...
is a one-way trip to sick bay or the morgue.
Now, tonight, after night call...
one of you brings me
twice this length of copper tubing...
a spot heater and a CO2 scrubber.
I'll show you people how this is done.
All right?
Now get the hell out of here
before I change my mind.
Thank you.
Children.
He's very handsome.
You really think so?
She says that about everyone.
You disagree?
He's attractive.
I hope you're more convincing
than that with him.
If he wants to find me, he'll head north,
toward Cylon forces he's already seen.
If he wants to go alone, he'll go south,
hoping to find another way off the planet.
Either way,
he won't make his move until nightfall.
If he flees, he dies.
There's going to be a huge reaction.
If there are any other Cylons...
aboard any of our ships,
we need to find them.
If we enlist the help of the public,
it'll make it a lot easier.
People are going to be shocked, angry,
terrified, paranoid.
There is a price to be paid
when asking for the public's help.
They're going to demand, at the very least,
that someone be held accountable.
I'm setting up a tribunal.
That tribunal will have to come back
to the public with a name.
Someone who screwed up.
We don't know if anybody screwed up.
A Cylon agent penetrated your security,
killing three people.
At least one of your men
or women screwed up.
Look, here's my view:
Independent tribunal, openness,
transparency, it all sounds great.
But after 20 years in political office,
I'm telling you these things have a way...
of inflicting damage on the people
you least expect.
I do not want a witch hunt on our hands.
So, where were you
at the time of the bombing?
In my rack, reading some trashy novel
Socinus gave me.
- Did you see the Chief?
- Chief?
He was on the Hangar Deck
going over some paperwork, I think.
How do you know that
if you were in your rack?
I saw him right before I turned in.
I was with Cally playing Pyramid
in the mess hall corridor.
You sure?
Yeah. She's pretty good.
- Did you see the Chief?
- Yeah, he was there.
I mean, not the whole time.
He dropped in, watched us play for a while.
Okay.
I was on watch.
Did you see the Chief?
The Chief? No.
- He wasn't on the Hangar Deck?
- No.
Wait. Yeah. Yeah, he was.
He came in, did some work
on one of the Vipers that the Captain rides.
Thank you.
- Asleep in my rack.
- Sure about that?
Positive.
I was asleep, Sergeant.
All right. That'll be all for now.
Good afternoon and thank you for coming.
Please be seated.
I'm sure by now, word of the explosion...
on the Galactica
has spread to the entire fleet.
We offer our continued gratitude
to the brave men and women...
aboard this mighty ship.
In consultation with Commander Adama...
I have appointed an independent tribunal...
to investigate the circumstances
surrounding this explosion.
Also, in the interest of security
and public safety...
I feel it is time to reveal certain information
that has until now...
remained a tightly-guarded secret.
This information was known only to myself,
Commander Adama...
- and a few select advisors.
- The cat's out of the bag.
The Cylons have the ability to mimic
human form. They look like us now.
We have reason to believe
that a Cylon agent was responsible...
for the explosions aboard Galactica.
This man has been identified
as a Cylon agent.
We believe him to be responsible
for the bombing.
He evidently slipped aboard the Galactica
with a civilian group...
killed a Marine guard,
stole the explosives and detonated them...
killing three members of the crew
and destroying himself.
This man has also been identified
as a Cylon.
And we now know that
there are duplicates of each Cylon model.
Anyone seeing either of these two men
at anytime, anywhere in the fleet...
should immediately contact
the Battlestar Galactica...
and the office of the President.
Now I'll take your questions.
They've known about this the whole time
and they tell us now?
Cylon?
- I mean, who's the Cylon now?
- This is too much.
I don't even want to know this.
Excuse me, sir.
Will you come with us, please?
What? Why?
What's going on, Sergeant?
Chief, we need you
to come along as well.
You're arresting the Chief?
Who's arresting him?
- No one is under arrest.
- What's all this?
Step back.
Lieutenant asked you a question, Sergeant.
A Tribunal has been convened...
to look into the Cylon penetration
of our defences.
It requires the presence
of Lt. Valerii and Chief Tyrol.
I am here to escort them
to the Wardroom. Sir.
Very well.
Proceed.
Thank you, sir.
Lieutenant, Chief,
you'll come with me, please.
You're it till I get back. Don't worry.
Lt. Valerii, where were you
at the time of the explosion?
I was in my rack. Asleep.
Did anyone see you, sir?
I don't know. I was asleep.
Lieutenant...
is it true that you and the Chief are involved
in a romantic and physical relationship...
in violation of
the Colonial Code of Military Conduct?
- I thought this was about...
- Just answer the question, please.
Are you and the Chief
involved in a relationship?
No.
The XO ordered us to put a stop to it.
And so we did.
Sir, can you testify
as to the whereabouts...
of Chief Petty Officer Tyrol
at the time of the bombing?
I have no idea where he was.
- Thank you, sir.
- You're excused, Lieutenant.
But I am sure he had nothing to do
with the bombing...
You are excused, Lieutenant.
Bring in the next witness, please.
The testimony you give before
this tribunal may be used...
to adjudicate your guilt or innocence
in the matter under investigation.
Do you understand?
Yes.
The matter being investigated
is first...
how a Cylon,
penetrated Galactica's security system...
and second,
whether one of Galactica's crew members...
aided and abetted this crime through...
conspiracy and collusion with the Cylons.
Collusion with the Cylons?
Do you consent to give
your testimony freely without invoking...
your right to remain silent as provided for
under the 23rd Article of Colonization?
- I do.
- Then let's begin.
They're going after the Chief.
They're going after the Cylons.
- What the hell does that mean?
- Wake up.
The world's changed while you were asleep.
Frak you.
Cylons look like people.
That means anyone. Anyone.
- Not the Chief.
- How do you know?
- I know.
- This is stupid.
You two just don't want to deal with reality.
You want to keep your heads
buried in the sand.
That's exactly what the Cylons want.
For us to turn on each other.
Start getting suspicious, paranoid.
She's right.
If we don't believe in each other
when the heat comes down, we're nothing.
That kind of thinking is over.
It's every man for himself now.
You better watch your backs.
You had the mid-watch
before the bombing, correct?
Yes.
Would you please explain to the tribunal
what you do on watch?
I walk the perimeter
of the Hangar Deck...
the tool rooms, storage facilities.
To make sure all hatches are sealed?
Yes.
That no unauthorised personnel
is poking around where they shouldn't?
That's right. And there was no one
on the Hangar Deck that night.
I believe that's what your log says.
What about the hatch combing
for Causeway C?
- Anybody see you?
- No.
I went through the hatch combing
on C Causeway.
Your log indicates that all hatches
and portals were locked and sealed.
If that's what the log indicates,
then that's the case.
Which would include
the hatch combing for Causeway C?
I don't know where the Sergeant
is going with this.
But they're not related.
What if I told you that...
I found the hatch open after the bombing?
I would say that
I don't know how that's possible.
It's not just any hatch on the Hangar Deck.
It opens onto a causeway which leads
directly to a small arms locker...
where a Marine guard was found dead
at the scene.
The locker was opened
with the correct code.
Do you have the correct code
to that locker, Chief?
Yes, I do, as do dozens of others,
including the guard.
It's possible the Cylon forced the guard
to open it before he killed him.
I want to take this opportunity to state that,
that was an internal security matter.
And this falls under the purview
of the Master at Arms.
And the Master at Arms is Sergeant Hadrian.
Did Lt. Valerii leave
the hatch combing open last night?
I have no idea
who left the hatch combing open last night.
Chief, were you doing paperwork
at the time of the bombing?
- No.
- Were you working on a Viper at that time?
No.
Were you watching a pick-up game
of Pyramid in the mess hall...
at the time of the bombing?
No! As I told you earlier today,
I was asleep in my rack.
Then why do I have
three different statements...
from three of your deckhands...
stating variously that they all saw you
and you were anywhere but in your rack?
Chief Tyrol, where were you
at the time of the bombing?
Were you, in fact,
meeting with a Cylon agent?
I exercise my right under Article 23.
By invoking the 23rd Article at this time,
the tribunal will look on this...
as further evidence of your guilt.
So I will ask you one last time.
Who were you with
at the time of the bombing...
and was this person a Cylon agent?
Your sworn statement
indicates that you were on watch...
at the time of the bombing
and that you saw Chief Tyrol...
- work on one of the Vipers. Is that true?
- Yes, sir.
Specialist, can you explain to us
why Chief Tyrol told us in his testimony...
that he was in his rack asleep
at the time of the bombing?
Speak up, Specialist.
He said that?
Did you see him or didn't you?
Specialist!
No, I did not, sir.
So the Chief did not come
to the Hangar Deck after all?
I don't know.
I left my post.
Excuse me?
I left my post, sir.
I ducked out to get a smoke.
I went to the galley to get some chow.
The Chief...
I mean, I don't know where he was.
I'm sure he was asleep in his rack
just like he said.
You went to the galley?
Yes, sir.
Did you go through
the hatch combing on C Deck?
Well, to get to the galley,
that would be the best way.
Yes, sir, I went through that hatch.
- Did you leave it open?
- I'm not sure.
Yes, sir. I think I did.
The Chief had nothing to do with it.
It was me.
I left my post and I left the hatch open.
It was me. Just me.
You realise, that by leaving the hatch open,
you allowed a Cylon...
to gain access to the small arms locker?
Yes, sir.
Specialist, did Chief Tyrol instruct you
to leave the hatch open deliberately...
as part of a conspiracy to allow the Cylon
to gain access to the small arms locker?
The Chief is innocent. He didn't do anything.
Specialist, did you leave
the hatch open deliberately?
Yes, sir.
Whatever happened, it was me. Just me.
South.
You overestimated his willingness
to risk himself for you.
He just doesn't love you.
Wait.
North. Toward his love.
Seems you made an impression after all.
He's a good man.
He always does the right thing.
Are you prepared for the next step?
Yes.
- Hello, Lieutenant.
- Doctor.
I brought you a cigar. A recovery gift.
- How are you?
- I'm good.
The food is good, company is better.
Yes, I just happened to be
absolutely nowhere near sick bay.
I thought I would...
- see how you were doing.
- So, Doctor...
your super secret project's on C Deck, right?
I'm not at liberty to divulge exactly
what I am doing on C Deck.
But you're more than welcome to pop by.
Once you're ambulatory.
- The bomber was on C Deck, right?
- Yes, I know. I heard the explosion.
- Very frightening.
- Do you think that's where he was headed?
- I'm sorry. I didn't follow you.
- The Cylon bomber?
Do you think that he was trying
to blow up your project?
And you along with it?
It's funny.
I hadn't thought of that.
Kind of hits you where you live, huh?
Yes, it does, actually.
You get well soon.
They're trying to kill me.
Me, always me.
They're trying to destroy your work.
Destroying you is an added bonus.
But why?
I don't understand.
Why are they trying to blow me up?
You told me what to do.
I wouldn't be making
this Cylon detector if it wasn't for you.
But I'm just in your head, Gaius.
They don't know about me or us
or our life together.
How romantic.
I'm going to have to destroy
that Cylon detector myself.
Blame the sabotage on Cylon agents.
That's what I'll tell Adama.
No, you won't.
You're gonna complete the project
just like I told you.
Really? Would I?
Or what?
Don't make me angry, Gaius.
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.
Sharon.
Is that enough?
No, Sharon wouldn't give up
without a much earned fight.
Did you read the tribunal report?
Yes.
And I'm sorry to read that one of your men
has been charged with conspiracy...
- and collusion with a Cylon agent.
- Specialist Socinus.
But after reading the transcripts
I have my doubts.
What about this other man,
your Chief Tyrol, he took the 23rd?
- What is that about, do you think?
- It's his right.
The courts have never held
that invoking the right to remain silent...
can be used as evidence of guilt.
You sound like a lawyer.
My father was a lawyer. Civil liberties.
Let's set aside the legalities for a moment.
Obviously, you are defending your man.
I respect that, I do.
But he is hiding something.
Chief Tyrol has been under my command
for over five years.
And if he had really wanted
to take this ship down...
he could. This is over.
Madam President,
I'm gonna have to call you right back.
What?
I have orders to bring you
before the tribunal, sir.
Let's go.
It's okay.
Helo.
What's happening?
Can you walk?
I think so.
Come on. I got you. Okay.
Now we're even.
- I think we should go.
- Right. Okay.
Come on.
It's going to be all right.
You're going to be just fine.
Commander Adama, when did you
first learn the truth about the Cylons?
On Ragnar station. Before we left.
And you chose to withhold
this crucial information, sir?
Yes.
Why?
I felt that...
to alarm the public,
would only cause chaos and panic.
But...
you also withheld the information...
from your own security detachment
aboard ship, sir.
Not knowing who to trust,
I decided to keep the information...
compartmentalised for the time being.
Sir, isn't it true that had we known that
the Cylons appeared human...
different security procedures
would have been followed?
Probably.
But I had to weigh
the possible ramifications of both.
Isn't it also true, sir, that
had different procedures been followed...
- the bombing may have been prevented?
- That's speculative.
- I'm asking if it's possible.
- I know what you're asking, Sergeant.
I will not speculate as to
what might have happened.
Do you personally believe that...
a Cylon agent planted explosives
in the ship's water tank?
Yes.
Do you believe that there are Cylon agents
aboard ship even as we speak?
Yes, I do.
Sir, isn't it true that you knew...
that Lt. Valerii and Chief Tyrol
were having an illicit relationship...
in violation of regulations?
I don't see the relevance
of this line of questioning, Sergeant.
The commander should bear in mind...
that my questions are not subject
to the Commander's review.
Why did you allow the relationship
to continue...
knowing it was against regulations?
I'm a soft touch.
Sir, are you aware that
both Lt. Valerii and Chief Tyrol...
have been implicated as possibly being
in collusion with the Cylons?
I'm aware of the allegations.
Where are you going with this?
I will ask the questions, sir.
Isn't it true that by allowing
their relationship to continue...
in violation of regulations...
you may have made it possible
for two Cylon collaborators...
to compromise the safety and security
of this ship?
We're done here.
Excuse me, sir,
but my questions are not finished.
You've lost your way, Sergeant.
You've lost sight of the purpose of the law...
to protect its citizens, not persecute them.
Whatever we are, whatever is left of us.
We're better than that.
Now these proceedings are closed.
You'll be transported back to your ships,
and we appreciate your help.
Commander.
This is an independent board.
You have no authority to close our inquiry.
This is a witch hunt.
I will not have it aboard my ship.
Corporal of the guard!
Restrain the Commander
and return him back to the witness chair.
Your orders are to escort
Sergeant Hadrian back to her quarters...
and keep her in confinement
until further notice.
Make your choice, son.
Sergeant Hadrian,
you'll come with us, please.
She's just about to speak.
Yes, I tried to get an interview
with her myself.
Good evening, have a seat.
The investigation into the suicide bombing
aboard Galactica...
and how it was allowed to occur
has come to a close.
You are all aware that the bomber
was a Cylon agent.
The tribunal has determined...
that the Cylon gained access
to the explosives...
by going through a hatch door
in the Hangar Deck of the ship.
This door was left open due to negligence...
of one of the ship's crewmen.
His name is Specialist Socinus.
He has confessed to lying under oath
and dereliction of duty in a time of war.
He has been stripped of his rank
and confined to the Brig.
At this point, we have no reason to believe...
that there were
any other parties responsible.
Now I'll take your questions. You, sir.
Commander, permission to enter?
What is it, Chief?
Thank you, sir.
Sir, I believe that Socinus...
I believe that his confession was a lie.
I think that he's covering for me.
For you?
I think that he's doing this
out of a sense of misplaced loyalty to me.
Somewhere in this there's truth.
Care to take me to it?
Sir, I was with Lt. Valerii
at the time of the bombing.
The Deck gang, they all knew it.
They've known all along.
They're trying to cover for me.
They started lying. Socinus...
I think that he thinks he's helping
protect me by taking a fall like this.
You don't really know
if he was on duty or not, do you?
Commander, he's innocent.
I know that much. I should be in the Brig.
Well, that's a fact.
You should be in the Brig.
Commander, this isn't right.
- You can't let an innocent kid...
- I can't?
What I can't do...
is I can't let someone
that wears this uniform...
get on the witness stand and lie under oath.
And that's what your man did.
He either lied the first time
or he lied the second time.
And it doesn't matter.
He's guilty and he'll pay the price.
You? You'll pay a different price.
You'll have to walk out
on that Hangar Deck every day...
knowing that one of your men
is in the Brig...
because you couldn't keep your fly zipped.
You're the most experienced,
noncommissioned officer we have left.
You keep my planes flying.
I need my planes to fly.
Dismissed.
Sir.
Sharon, no.
What?
Sharon, we're done. It's over.
- What do you mean it's over?
- I love you.
I really do.
I'm sorry.
Wait a minute.
I deserve more of an explanation
than that.
Sure.
One of my men is in the Brig.
He confessed to a crime he didn't commit
to protect me, to protect us.
There can be no more "us."
No more secrets, no more lies, that's it.
It's over.
I can't believe
you can just turn your back on us.
I put everything on the line for you.
Everything. I cover for you, I protect you.
I risk my career, my freedom,
my integrity, for what?
So some innocent kid,
one of my kids, can take the fall for me?
No!
We are not worth that.
Okay.
Right.
I guess I'll see you around.
One more thing.
Did you leave the hatch combing
open last night?
What?
Did you leave the hatch combing
open last night?
What are you saying?
That I helped the Cylon?
I didn't say anything.
I'm just asking a question.
I think I deserve an answer.
You have the only answer
you're ever gonna get.
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica:
Ignoring me won't help.
No, I've decided you're
an expression of my subconscious mind...
playing itself out in my waking states.
So, I'm in your head?
Of course if you're not really here,
neither am I.
Do you have any idea
what they would do to me if they find out?
They'd probably charge you with treason.
Treason is punishable by the death penalty.
Come on, Sharon. Where are you?
Helo!
We gotta go. Right now.
I don't see the hand of God in here.
Could I be looking in the wrong place?
Let me see. Proteins? Yes.
Haemoglobin? Yes.
Divine digits? No.
Sorry. I'm sure I can find evidence...
of his divine hand
in one of these delightful samples.
After all, there are so fracking many...
I'm sure even I can be relied upon
to find God in one of them.
What is it
that drives you to blasphemy, Gaius?
A need to tempt fate?
Boredom, actually.
Indeed, every waking hour
is spent...
in what some might say, has become
my own personal religion.
The Church of the Mystic Cylon Detector.
Are you finished?
If you would give yourself over
to God's will...
you'd find peace in his love as I have.
Could you help me with this zipper?
I'm having trouble.
He has a plan for us.
How do you know it's a he?
There is only one, true God.
Really?
You running a glitch
in the programme or something?
'Cause you say the same thing
over and over again.
Now, I've accepted your God and all that.
Can't we reboot the hard drive?
He's not my God. He is God.
Yeah, your God, my God, everyone's God.
He's big enough for all of us, isn't he?
Now, please.
Please, honey.
Can't we do something
a little more elevating?
It's important you form
a personal relationship with God.
Only you can give yourself over
to his eternal love.
For God's sake!
I can't take this anymore!
I'm trying to save your immortal soul.
What you are doing, darling, is boring me
to death with your superstitious drivel.
Your metaphysical nonsense...
which, to be fair, actually appeals
to the half-educated dullards...
that make up most of human society,
but which, I hasten to add...
no rational, intelligent,
free-thinking human being truly believes.
Which leads me
to the inescapable conclusion...
that Cylons are, in the final...
That Cylons are, in the final analysis,
little more than toasters...
with great looking legs.
It's my fantasy. See if I care.
I'll dream up someone new...
a brunette maybe.
Maybe we can dispense with the foreplay.
Get right down to...
What did you say?
That was nothing.
I was just talking to myself.
I talk to myself.
Hang me.
The Commander would like to see you
in the CIC, Doctor.
There you are. Very nice.
- That blouse could open up a button.
- Excuse me?
You wanted to see me, Commander?
Miss Godfrey has brought some
very disturbing accusations to my attention.
I think you should have the chance
to answer them in person.
Right. Thank you.
- And she is?
- She's standing right there.
- I'm right here.
- Yeah, of course you are.
- And?
- Doctor, this is Miss Godfrey.
All of you can see her? You can all see her!
She's standing right next to you.
- Something wrong?
- No.
Don't make me angry, Gaius.
I'd say you have a serious problem.
Get down.
Yes, maybe I...
You'll have to forgive me, Miss Godfrey.
I'm very pleased, if slightly puzzled,
to make your acquaintance.
Don't touch me, you traitor.
Is she talking to me? You talking to me?
You're the one who let the Cylons
into the defence mainframe.
You betrayed your entire race.
You're the man responsible
for the Holocaust...
and I'm here to see that you're exposed...
and sentenced to death
as the traitor you really are.
Doctor, Miss Godfrey has made
some startling accusations.
I've never seen this woman before in my life.
Not surprised you don't remember me.
I was just a lowly systems analyst
at the defence ministry.
Doctor Amarak was my associate.
She says you sold out the human race.
You let the Cylons into our defence plans.
Doctor Amarak told me
he had evidence...
that Doctor Baltar was involved
in the sneak attack.
He was trying to reach the President
and inform her when he was killed.
- He told you that, did he?
- Yes.
It's a pity he's no longer with us.
How convenient
that we only have your word for that.
- There's also this.
- Yeah, what the frack's that?
He gave me this for safekeeping.
It's ID coded.
Colonial Defence Ministry.
Dr. Amarak gave the disk to me
before he died.
What, as opposed to after he died?
He gave me the disk for safekeeping.
On the disk is a photo.
It was captured from the security camera
in the defence mainframe on Caprica.
It shows the doctor
entering the mainframe...
without permission
the day before the attack.
Nothing criminal about that.
As you can see, the man in the photo
is carrying an explosive device.
Sorry, what?
I definitely never did that.
Just before the Cylon attack,
the entire defence mainframe...
was destroyed by this device.
Honestly, that is not me.
I wasn't there. It's somebody else.
Look, it's not me.
I'm not the man in the photograph.
I see a man. Same height,
same build, but that's a long way from proof.
Thank you, Commander. Now,
if we're quite done with this charade, I'm...
I agree, Commander, but look here.
In the faceplate of the computer terminal,
there's a reflection of the man's face.
You can't tell anything from that.
Thank you, Colonel.
With the right equipment,
the image could be enlarged and sharpened.
We could see his face.
Enlarging the image is no problem,
but sharpening it...
- Take forever.
- It'd take at least a day, sir.
Mr. Gaeta, let me know
as soon as you have an image.
Sir.
You're going to suspend all work
on the Cylon detector...
- What?
...as well as your security privileges.
Starbuck's notes on the Cylon Raider
are a mess.
She said "the engine power-up
sequence began by squeezing something...
"that looks like a red ligament
with blue veins on the right side...
"coming out of a sack of gooey fluid...
- "shaped like a dog."
- Are you kidding me?
This whole thing is a bunch of veins
and ligaments and sacks of goo.
"Squeeze the ligament
with your hand...
"while you slide your weight...
"on your left hip into the lymphatic sack."
That's just stupid.
Afternoon, sir.
Specialist.
- Chief's inside?
- Yeah.
Chief.
God! Yes, sir?
How's it coming in there?
I'm getting there, sir.
I haven't quite figured out all the tricks,
but I'm getting there.
Come on, Starbuck, you can do it.
That smarts.
That smarts, but I don't care.
You don't care.
I don't care,
because your pain is my entertainment.
Your crutches of death, sir.
Use them wisely.
Shut up.
It's gonna hurt like hell,
but it's supposed to.
Thanks, Doc.
No pain, no gain.
No cliché left unturned as Kara Thrace
returns to the world of the walking.
Can she do it or will she fall on her ass?
I swear to the Gods, I'm gonna beat the crap
out of both of you...
as soon as I get better.
No, I can't.
Yes, you can. You did it.
I can't.
You're not gonna get better
lying on your back.
Frack off!
Just take a break for five minutes,
we'll try again.
I don't want to do it again.
I want a pill, now, please.
Sorry, we're weaning you off the magic pills
starting today.
Besides, I need them for myself.
You son of a bitch.
I am finding this whole thing
hard to fathom, Doctor.
Thank you, Madam President.
I can't tell you how much that means to me.
Look, I was wondering,
is there any chance...
that while this investigation is going on,
I could come back to the Colonial One...
because I've left some of my things there.
No, I'm sorry, Doctor.
You have been put on a "no fly list."
Security.
Madam President,
I need to get off Galactica.
I need to get away from
this Shelly Godfrey woman in particular.
She's got it in for me.
Where are you?
Madam President, I have reason to believe...
that she may be a Cylon.
Madam President?
Madam President?
Hello?
Get Doc Cottle on the wireless,
the President has collapsed.
Hello?
Is she alive?
Yes, the President is alive.
I told you, she's conscious,
she's resting.
She's receiving treatment.
What kind of treatment?
Asked and answered.
We think it's a stomach flu.
What kind of treatment?
How many of these did you take,
young lady?
- One, two?
- Two.
- Three.
- Three times the dosage.
Must work three times as fast then, right?
Everybody wants to be their own doctor,
you are lucky you didn't lapse into a coma.
You can't cure cancer by overdose.
Story's all over the fleet. I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
It seemed like an emergency.
I didn't think that anyone
might be picking up the transmission.
We're all new at this. It's okay.
The thing to do now is
to get me on my feet...
and in front of the press
before the end of the day.
I could give you a shot,
but you wouldn't like the side effects.
Just do it.
The time is going to come when you won't
be able to hide what you're going through.
It's not that kind of a shot.
Thank you.
Baltar's correct
about the convenience of it all.
Amarak just happens to bring you
the key piece of evidence just before he dies.
Something was going on.
He was almost paranoid.
Kept saying that the Olympic Carrier
had been infiltrated by the Cylons.
He wanted me to take some things
off the ship for safekeeping.
Why'd he give it to you?
We were friends.
Friends?
I loved him. I loved him very much.
There are times
when I just feel so alone now.
Times when I just want so much
to be held again.
- You understand that, don't you?
- Of course.
There must be times when you feel alone.
And the thought of another body
next to yours...
seems like something out of dream.
Do not, under any circumstances,
allow Shelly Godfrey to leave this ship.
Put her under surveillance, discreetly.
I want to know everybody she's talked to,
and everywhere she's been.
Come on, Sharon! Get up.
Excuse me.
Lieutenant?
Is that you?
Doctor?
Isn't this a coincidence.
So, how are you doing?
I'm...
You're busy. Yes, I know.
I don't mean to distract you.
Please, don't let me interrupt you.
You still there?
Yup.
I know this is an awkward time.
But it occurred to me I haven't told you...
how invaluable your assistance
has been over the past few weeks.
Thank you, Doctor. You have no idea
how much that means to me.
Not at all.
So, how's it going over there?
In the lab, that is?
I'm talking about the photograph.
Right. It's coming along.
Great.
Quickly, actually.
A few more hours to go.
Has it ever occurred to you
that the photograph...
disk itself could be a fake?
I've already authenticated the disk.
Obviously, you're good.
But there are many ways around security.
If I could join you in the lab for just
two minutes of your time, I could show you.
I really don't think that's possible.
Listen to me, nobody would need to know.
It would just be you and me.
I know.
For God's sake, my life is on the line.
My reputation is at stake.
So is mine, Doctor. I really...
Someone's coming.
Wait, Gaeta!
You forgot to wash your hands!
What the hell...
I want answers, now!
I'm not interested
in playing any more of your games!
Have you lost your mind?
That's an interesting question...
one I pose to myself on a regular basis.
Who's really in the photograph?
You are!
I didn't plant any bomb, anywhere,
at any time, and you know that.
I don't know anything of this sort.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
All right. Let's entertain the notion,
just for a moment...
that you are not the woman
that I see everywhere.
You are not Shelly Godfrey, either.
You're a fake. You're just a copy.
Another Cylon copy.
Get out.
Struck a nerve, have I?
Which I find rather impossible to believe!
You think this is over? This is not over!
You have not heard the last.
No more "Mr. Nice Gaius"!
Women.
Stupid. Unbelievable.
Bucket!
Not a good time?
No, it's fine.
Guess you're having problems?
I can't get this thing to work.
I've been over it and over it, and nothing.
I have no idea how Starbuck
got this thing to move.
Much less fly.
It's not really a thing, you know.
It's probably a Cylon itself.
More of an animal maybe,
than the human models.
Maybe they genetically design it
to perform a task.
To be a fighter.
Can't treat it like a thing
and expect it to respond.
You have to treat it like a pet.
But, at least, that's my guess.
- Your guess?
- Yeah, that's right. My guess.
Something else you want to say?
No.
Lieutenant. I heard you were supposed to be
up on your feet by now.
You heard wrong.
I figured you wouldn't bounce back so fast.
Is there something you wanted,
or did you just drop by to torment me, sir?
The Chief wanted me
to kick your ass out of bed...
so you could help figure out
that Raider of yours.
But, clearly, you still need the rest.
Take your time. No rush.
Do you actually think that reverse
psychology crap is going to work on me?
I really don't care what you think.
All I know is that every day
you spend in that bed...
is another day that I have
my opinion of you confirmed. As you were.
And I am convinced, in fact,
that she is a Cylon agent.
In my opinion, she should be locked up
before she can do any more damage.
Where are you?
You're having a little fun?
Do you enjoy messing around with my life?
Do you have any evidence
to support this charge?
Work on the Cylon detector
is nearly complete with a few tweaks.
I'll have a test regime up and running.
All I need is a tissue sample
from this woman for analysis.
I thought we had something.
Something special.
I can't allow you access
to your equipment.
All right.
But under instruction, I can surely tell Gaeta
how to prepare the samples.
- It's not difficult.
- Let me be frank with you, Doctor.
If your picture is on that photograph...
every piece of equipment in your laboratory
will be dismantled and quarantined.
And every person that you have met
will be questioned and investigated.
I love you. There, I've said it.
Isn't that what you've been dying to hear?
I am willing to make that commitment
to you right now.
The President believes I'm innocent.
The President hopes you're innocent.
And so do I.
Because if you're not,
then you've made fools of both of us.
And I don't like to be made a fool of.
And I don't like to be accused
of participating...
in the genocide of the human race
based solely on the word...
of a woman whom I have already indicated
to you may well be a Cylon agent.
I'm willing to do anything. Anything at all.
I need your help.
I did not conspire with the Cylons.
I am an innocent man...
who is being convicted
in the court of public opinion without trial.
Traitor.
Fire.
All units report to damage control stations.
We got a fire!
Let's go. Clear the doors!
Frack!
No fires reported anywhere on the ship.
The exact location of the alarm.
D-Wing corridor
where it intersects with C-Wing.
That's the lab.
Erase.
Put it down!
Put it down.
All right, move in.
Take him to the Brig.
Yes, Commander.
I would like to speak to my attorney.
Can't I speak to my attorney?
I need some representation,
it's not what it looks like.
She's got it in for me, that Shelly Godfrey!
Shut up. All of you.
Not one single word from any of you, okay?
What seems to be the problem?
Your new boyfriend's a bit of a jerk, sir.
It's a girl.
If you don't mind her goo
on your face, she's all yours, sir.
Okay.
He likes the warm light.
Makes the touch easier, right?
Maybe, okay.
This is stupid.
This is stupid.
It's worth a try, sir. It did fly for you once.
Hasn't made so much as a grunt since.
I don't know, take it for a ride.
Ride it.
Treat it like a horse.
Okay, a horse.
Why not a goat? That's good, right?
Think of it as a goat. Okay. Whatever.
Come on, boy. Giddyup!
Okay, you're kidding. Chief?
Don't shoot anything.
Doctor.
Madam President.
- I am so sorry.
- Thank you.
You are here to free me, right?
To bring this travesty to a close...
because you know I'm innocent.
Just tell me, so I understand...
because I want to understand
why you did it.
I didn't do it. It wasn't me.
I'm being framed!
Why would she do that?
Because she's a Cylon.
She's a Cylon.
- You are going to have to believe me.
- I want to believe you.
I want to believe that I haven't made
such a profound error in judgment...
in trusting you...
and asking your advice.
But here's where we are, Doctor.
If anyone can be a Cylon,
and it's hard to tell us apart...
then we only have one thing left to trust...
our instincts, feelings.
And the moment they told me
it was your face in the photo...
I knew I believed it.
I believe you're involved in the attack.
Somehow, I feel it.
You'll forgive me, Madam President...
if I don't wish to be executed
based solely on your gut feeling.
May the gods have mercy on your soul.
Call it.
Heads.
Heads. You win. You sleep. I watch.
No. You're the one
who needs sleep.
I couldn't sleep if I had to listen to Tyrol
read the flight manual.
Okay.
Truth is if something happened to you...
I wouldn't know how to deal with it.
I feel the same way.
Back on the ship...
Look, I knew what was going on.
I mean, between you and the Chief.
I think everybody did.
And I respected it. Your feelings, his.
But I would've given anything to be him.
I'm not trying to put you on the spot here.
I don't want to step on what you two have.
You feel the way you feel
and I have to respect it.
No. It's not true.
I know we haven't spoke before.
But I don't wish to offend.
Please.
Dear God...
I now acknowledge
that you are the one true God.
Deliver me from this evil...
and I will devote the rest
of what is left of my wretched life...
to doing good.
I don't know what to...
To carrying out your divine will
is what I want to do.
To carry out your divine will.
Grant me grace and forgiveness.
I'm here now. I'm here.
All will be well.
It will be as God wants it to be.
Open the door.
Wait. I haven't even had a trial yet.
No! Wait! It's a lie!
- Doctor, it's all right.
- It's a lie!
Photograph was a fake.
What?
It was almost seamless, but your face,
the man, the reflection, it was all a fake.
Of course it was a fake.
I don't wear a shirt like that.
How did you...
I went back, re-ran security checks.
This time I found markers
which pointed to photo manipulation.
They weren't apparent
until the photo was fully resolved.
You re-ran the security checks?
Thank you.
I just knew that you could never
have anything to do with that attack.
You're not that kind of man.
It was really nothing.
Once the photos were fully resolved...
it was almost too easy,
like she wanted to be found out.
How did she get off?
Got me.
- There's been no ships.
- I gave you an order.
I had two Marines tailing her.
They say they went around a corner
and she was gone.
Every ship in the fleet has reported in, sir.
No sign of her.
That's unacceptable.
She was here. She was right here.
This woman existed. She didn't just vanish.
Have them check again.
- Every ship?
- Every ship, including this one.
She didn't just vanish.
that he had been a victim
of treachery and deceit.
Clearly, the Cylons wanted
to discredit Doctor Baltar...
because of his work on the Cylon detector.
Doctor Baltar, it gives me great pleasure...
to exonerate you publicly...
and to recognise you,
once again, among us...
as a scientist, a leader, and a friend.
You're a hero.
You're even more popular and powerful
than ever before.
You've had your trial by fire,
so now they truly believe in you.
Hard for anyone to accuse you
of treason again.
Was that the plan all along?
Build me up in the public eye
by first tearing me down?
Right.
Who am I to question the plans
of Almighty God?
Just one, small, practical question.
Shelly? Shelly Godfrey?
Was there ever a woman
really called Shelly Godfrey?
Did she ever actually exist?
Was she ever really here?
God's will be done.
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica:
Doral!
When this body dies, my consciousness
will be transferred to another one.
The Cylons have the ability to mimic
human form. They look like us now.
This man has been identified
as a Cylon agent.
- You sleep, I watch.
- No. You're the one who needs sleep.
You were lucky
that you didn't lapse into a coma.
The time is going to come when you won't
be able to hide what you're going through.
Laura.
Yes?
Madam President, are you okay in there?
I'm fine, it's just the side effects
from the Chamalla.
You know that thing they say,
"What's worse? The cancer or the cure?"
What do you need?
You have an urgent call
from the Captain of the Gemenon Traveller.
Can I call him back?
He says he found a Cylon on board.
They found him
in the starboard storage compartment.
Looked like he'd been camped here
for days.
Are they sure it's a Cylon?
The captain identified him
by one of the photos we sent out.
He's another copy
of the man you knew as Leoben Conroy.
Where is it now?
Aboard the Gemenon Traveller,
locked in a storeroom, under guard.
Isolate that ship.
Order the CAP to fly escort
around the Gemenon Traveller.
And not to approach
any other ship in the fleet.
Aye, sir.
Kat, Galactica, fly close...
I'll send a team over
to destroy it immediately.
I want this man interrogated first.
First of all...
it's not a him, it's an it...
second, anything it says cannot be trusted.
Best thing to do is destroy it immediately.
I'd like to hear what this thing has to say.
It might be important.
Madam President,
I've dealt with this model before.
lt'll fill your head with doubletalk,
half-baked philosophy and confuse you.
Then send someone
who won't be easily confused.
That's an order, Commander.
I want him interrogated.
Order understood.
Think it'll give me something?
No.
President disagrees.
You need me to go, I'll shower up and go.
How's this coming?
We got the entire avionics package
figured out.
Fire control, navigation...
and I think that I am zeroing in
on her FTL drive.
I did this in a hurry about three weeks ago.
It's my after-action report on Leoben.
It's a very clever machine.
Manipulative, cunning.
The only problem with Leoben
isn't that he lies.
That would be too easy.
It's that he mixes lies with truth.
Just remember,
he's gonna try to get into your head.
My mum always said
there was nothing in there anyway.
Just be careful.
He has an agenda.
It's a goal you won't understand until later.
Your job is to make sure
he doesn't achieve the goal.
Yes, sir.
Lieutenant.
- What's up?
- Nothing.
Just wanted to see if
what I told you the other day helped at all?
Yeah. Actually it did.
You do treat this thing
more like an animal than a machine...
and it actually works.
Where did you come up with that
anyway? Just pop into your head?
- I'm a Cylon.
- You know, that's not even funny.
If I could prove that I wasn't...
would that make a difference?
You know, between us?
Gemenon Traveller,
Raptor seven-one-niner...
inbound with Lt. Thrace aboard.
Permission to dock.
Roger, seven-one-niner.
Permission granted.
Really does look like a person.
Yeah.
Must be all full of wires inside.
No, you cut him open,
there's blood, guts the whole thing.
It's sweating.
Well, I'll be. Look at that.
God, they go through a lot of trouble
to imitate people.
Why do you think they do that?
I don't care why.
But the fact
that these things sweat...
now that's interesting.
Sleeping?
Praying.
I don't think
the Gods answer the prayers of toasters.
God answers everyone's prayers.
- How many Cylons are there in the fleet?
- We haven't been properly introduced.
I'm Leoben.
How many Cylons in the fleet?
I have no idea.
What's your name?
How long have you been hiding
aboard this ship?
Am I not allowed to know your name?
Why were you hiding here?
I had a mission to perform.
Listen, it's a small thing.
Can you just tell me who you are?
Tell me about your mission
and I'll think about it.
- My mission was to conduct sabotage.
- What kind of sabotage?
God, you stink.
Can I get some air in here?
Between you and the humidity.
I am not here
to play games with you.
You said you wanted to cooperate.
Either start talking or we are done.
Okay.
But...
I really wanna know your name.
Open.
Are you Lt. Starbuck?
Yes, you are.
I knew...
I was right.
I was right. I saw it. I've seen it.
- Happy now?
- It all makes sense now.
Doesn't it?
Now we can talk.
Now we can talk about a lot of things.
Like what?
I planted a nuclear warhead
aboard one of your ships.
It's set to go off at 1830 hours.
Where?
I'm not ready to give that up yet.
You're lying. There's no warhead.
You can't take the chance, Starbuck.
Your military training dictates you take it
to your masters and let them decide.
Maybe my training wasn't so good.
Maybe I push you out the air lock,
and tell them you never said a word.
Now, who's lying.
These things happen for a reason,
don't they?
I'm looking forward
to spending more time with you.
We have a lot to talk about.
It's gonna be fun.
Put the Red Team
on alert immediately. Dee?
And sweep Galactica
for any kind of radiological devices.
Right.
Contact all the captains in the fleet.
Have them do radiological sweeps
of their ships.
But emphasize that this is
just a precaution.
I don't wanna alarm anyone
until we're sure.
Yes, sir.
Well, we'll know for sure
in 8 hours and 40 minutes.
Lt. Thrace, did he say anything else?
No.
He guessed my call sign.
Seemed really happy
when he found out who I was.
He's playing with your mind.
He's been stowed away for weeks
aboard the fleet.
Fifty ways he could've heard
the word "Starbuck" on a wireless set.
That's what I figured, sir.
Any idea what he wants?
Not yet.
Says he's looking forward
to spending some time with me, though.
Don't take any chances, Starbuck.
Yes, sir.
You believe in the Gods, don't you?
Lords of Kobol, and all that?
Why should I tell you?
It's not a trick question.
I wanted to see how much I got right.
So you pray to Artemis, Aphrodite?
Where's the warhead?
I was right.
See, our faiths are similar,
but I look to one God, not to many.
I don't give a damn about what you believe.
To know the face of God,
is to know madness.
I see the universe.
I see the patterns.
I see the foreshadowing
that precedes every moment of every day.
It's all there. I see it. And you don't.
And I have a surprise for you.
I have something to tell you
about the future.
Is that so?
It is.
But we have to see this thing through
till the end.
What is the most basic article of faith?
This is not all that we are.
The difference between you and me is,
I know what that means and you don't.
I know that I'm more than this body,
this consciousness.
A part of me swims in the stream.
But in truth, I'm standing on the shore.
The current never takes me downstream.
This is worse than Galactica.
And I didn't think that was possible.
And what was that?
Swimming in streams or something?
Do you mind?
Thank you.
Starving. Haven't eaten in days.
Kind of bad programming, isn't it?
I mean, why bother with hunger?
- Part of being human.
- You're not human.
How's your lunch?
You know how it is.
When you're starving, anything tastes good.
Did that hurt?
Yeah, that hurt.
Machines shouldn't feel pain...
shouldn't bleed...
shouldn't sweat.
Sweat. That's funny. That's good.
See, a smart Cylon would turn off
the old pain software about now.
But I don't think you're so smart.
Maybe I'll turn it off
and you won't even know.
Here's your dilemma.
Turn off the pain, you feel better,
but that makes you a machine, not a person.
You see, human beings
can't turn off their pain.
Human beings have to suffer...
and cry, and scream, and endure...
because they have no choice.
So the only way you can avoid the pain
you're about to receive...
is by telling me exactly what I wanna know.
Just like a human would.
I knew this about you.
You're everything I thought you would be.
But it won't work. I won't tell you anything.
Maybe not.
But then, you'll know deep down
that I beat you...
that a human being beat you...
and that you are truly no greater
than we are.
You're just a bunch of machines after all.
Let the games begin.
Hi.
Well, look what the cat dragged in.
Lt. Valerii.
It's an unexpected visit.
You look wonderful.
I need your help.
Anything I can do.
Anything at all.
Wonder why they call her "Boomer"?
I heard you were working on a test...
to tell the difference
between Cylons and humans.
Bingo.
I can't really talk about that at the moment.
You wouldn't help settle a bet for me,
would you?
Why do they call you "Boomer"?
If you're working on a Cylon detector,
do you think I could be in the first batch?
You know, to be tested?
- What's her rush?
- What's your rush?
I'm not sure it would be
appropriate to show favouritism...
if indeed I am working on anything at all.
I saved your life back on Caprica.
My co-pilot gave up his seat for you.
I brought you back to Galactica, to safety.
You wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for me. You owe me.
She shoots. She scores.
I suppose there's some
small truth to that.
So can you test me or not?
I think you should do it.
Results will be quite intriguing.
The technology
for Cylon detection...
is not quite ready
for full-scale implementation.
But I could use a beta test subject.
Sharon's late.
Half an hour.
I notice you're calling her Sharon now.
Yeah, I choose to think of her
as one of them.
Because you dislike her?
Because in the scheme of things,
we are as we do.
She acts like one of them, thinks like them.
She is one of them.
But she's one of us.
It would be best to remember that.
- We had sex.
- Congratulations.
Does he love you?
I think so.
No. 6: Has he said it?
Not directly.
Then you're just guessing.
Stay in your current location.
We're setting up a cabin for you nearby.
Food, water, electricity. All the comforts.
Shouldn't be too hard to convince him
to stay and start a life together.
If not, kill him.
Can you handle that?
We made it this far, we'll make it all the way.
Something happened to you,
I wouldn't know how to deal with it.
Caprica.
If he flees, he dies.
Does he love you?
Helo.
Hey, what's going on?
Come on. We gotta go. Now.
I saw Cylons. They're heading this way.
We got to travel fast,
even faster than before.
- Why? What's different?
- Everything. Just trust me.
I do.
Now, if you were human...
you'd be just about ready
to start offering up some false information...
about the location of the nuke.
Some tiny thing that may get
you a reward and spare you some of this.
But then I keep forgetting you're not human.
You're a machine.
I am more...
than you could ever imagine.
I am God.
I'm sorry. You're God?
Wow. Nice to meet you.
That's good.
We'll give you a couple of minutes with that.
It's funny, isn't it?
We're all God, Starbuck. All of us.
I see the love
that binds all living things together.
Love?
You don't even know what the word means.
I know that God loved you
more than all other living creatures...
and you repaid his divine love with sin...
with hate, corruption, evil.
So then he decided to create the Cylons.
The Gods had nothing to do with it.
We created you. Us.
It was a stupid, fracked up decision,
and we have paid for it.
You slaughtered my entire civilisation.
That is sin. That is evil. And you are evil.
Am I?
I see the truths
that float past you in the stream.
You have a real thing
about rivers and streams, don't you?
I think we should indulge you
in your obsession.
Do you realise I could kill you
before they came back in the room?
I could get to my feet...
rip your skull from your spinal column...
crash through that door...
kill the guard in less time
than it has taken me to describe it to you.
Then why don't you?
It's not the time.
He's loose!
I have a surprise for you.
You fracked up, pal.
Now the gloves come off.
Combat, Col. Tigh.
How's the search going
for the nuke?
Nothing so far.
How much time remaining?
2 hours, 9 minutes.
Spread out the fleet.
No ship more than 500 clicks
from any other ship.
- lf there's a nuke, let's limit the damage.
- Aye, sir.
No.
Do it.
Leave him.
Sir?
Tell me where the warhead is...
otherwise you're gonna drown
in that bucket.
I can't drown. I can't die.
Right.
Commander Adama mentioned
that how if your body dies...
your consciousness is downloaded
or transferred into another body.
Something like that.
No, exactly like that.
See, I've been thinking.
Why is a Cylon willing to talk at all?
Why does he care if we destroy his body?
Won't he just transfer away and laugh
at all of us and our stupid human ideas?
Tell me where the warhead is.
This is not your path, Starbuck.
You have a different destiny.
Don't interrupt me.
You see, I'm gonna dazzle you
with my poor human brain.
You see, I think that you're afraid.
You're afraid that we're a long way
from home.
What if you don't transfer all the way back?
What if when you die here, you really die?
It's your chance to find out
if you're really God...
or just a bunch of circuits
with a bad haircut.
I'm not afraid of dying.
Someone's programmed you with a fairytale
of God, and streams, and life ever after.
But somewhere in that hard drive
you call a brain...
is a beeping message:
"Error, error. Does not compute.
"I don't have a soul. I have software.
"If I die, I'm gone."
I have a soul.
I see patterns.
I know you.
You're damaged.
You were born to a woman...
who believed suffering was good
for the soul, so you suffered.
Your life is a testament to pain.
Injuries. Accidents.
Some inflicted upon others,
others inflicted upon yourself.
It surrounds you like a bubble.
But it's not real, it's just...
It's just something she put in your head.
It's something that you wanna believe
because it means...
you're the problem,
not the world that you live in.
You wanna believe it
because it means that you're bad luck.
You're like a cancer
that needs to be removed.
Because you hear her voice every day.
And you want her to be right.
Start again.
Now, we just pop this in the slot
and wait for the results.
Green, you're a normal human being.
Red, you're an evil Cylon.
Should take a couple of minutes.
So tell me, are you from Aerilon?
There's a slight trace of an accent there.
What? No. Troy.
Troy.
Tell me, why is that familiar?
Mining settlement.
The accident.
The explosion. Right.
That was tragic.
Your family?
They died with the rest.
I'm very sorry.
It's a lie.
Congratulations, Doctor.
You've just uncovered your very first Cylon.
Now, here's an interesting moment
in the life of Gaius Baltar.
What will he do?
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm just interpolating the results.
The question is,
what will she do if you expose her?
Thank you or kill you?
I thought it was just green or red.
Well, it's a little more complicated than that.
She probably doesn't know.
She probably thinks she's just another girl
from Troy...
whose entire background vanished
in a mysterious accident.
Should be interesting to see
how she responds...
when you tell her the truth.
I'm guessing her Cylon side will take over
and break your neck...
before you can give away her secret.
Let's find out.
Congratulations, it's green.
It's very bright green.
- You're not a Cylon.
- Really?
100% human, and very bright green as well.
For a second,
I was worried what you were gonna say.
Were you?
Yeah.
Well, there's nothing
to be worried about anymore.
You couldn't be more human
if you tried.
- Well, thanks.
- Anytime.
I have something to tell you.
How long before this supposed bomb
goes off?
Less than an hour.
Get me a shuttle.
I'm going to the Gemenon Traveller.
I want to see the Cylon myself.
Madam President, you need to...
Don't even start.
I don't wanna discuss this.
I've made my decision.
Not until I get you a security detail.
Enough. For frack's sake, let him breathe.
You're really sick.
You're not a person. You're a machine
that's enjoying its own pain.
All this has happened before.
And all of it will happen again.
Don't quote scripture.
You don't have the right to use those words.
You kneel before idols and ask for guidance.
But you can't see
that your destiny's already been written.
Each of us plays a role.
Each time, a different role.
Maybe the last time, I was the interrogator
and you were the prisoner.
The players change,
the story remains the same.
And this time...
this time...
your role is to deliver my soul to God.
Do it for me.
It's your destiny and mine.
And I told you I had a surprise for you.
Are you ready?
You're gonna find Kobol.
Birthplace of us all.
Kobol will lead you to Earth.
This is my gift to you, Kara.
What the hell is going on here?
What exactly is it that you are doing here?
It's a machine, sir.
- There's no limit to the tactics I can use.
- And where's the warhead?
I don't know.
You don't know?
You spent the last eight hours
torturing this man.
This machine.
Whatever it is.
And you don't have
a single piece of information to show for it.
He thinks he can see the future.
Says he knows our destiny, our fate.
He says we're gonna find Kobol,
and that it's gonna lead us to Earth.
Clean him up. There's not much time.
Yes, sir.
Do you know who I am?
Yes.
I apologise for what you've been through.
Take his restraints off.
Do it.
Thank you.
I can do more.
I can guarantee your safety.
I can order your release.
We are running out of time.
We have only four minutes left
until your bomb goes off.
I've come here to tell you...
that this conflict between our peoples
does not have to continue.
It can stop right here with us.
We have to trust each other.
Trust me.
I think you know you can.
Tell me what I need to know,
and you will live.
The warhead doesn't exist. I made it up.
Lieutenant was right. I was too far out.
I didn't wanna die, so when I got caught,
I made up a story to buy some time.
I see.
Thank you for the truth.
Thank you, Madam President.
Don't be too hard on Kara.
She was just doing her job.
The military...
they teach you to...
dehumanise people.
I'll take that into consideration.
No, stand down.
Laura, I have something to tell you.
Adama is a Cylon.
Yeah.
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- The bomb?
- Nothing.
- Put him out the airlock.
- What?
- You can't do that. Not after he told you...
- Yes, I can. And I will.
Lieutenant, look at me.
You've lost perspective.
During the time I have allowed him
to remain alive and captive on this ship...
he has caused our entire fleet
to spread out defenceless.
He puts insidious ideas in our minds.
More lethal than any warhead.
He creates fear.
But you're right. He's a machine...
and you don't keep
a deadly machine around.
When it kills your people
and threatens your future...
you get rid of it.
He's not afraid to die.
He's just afraid that his soul
won't make it to God.
Lords of Kobol, hear my prayer.
I don't know if he had a soul or not.
But if he did, take care of it.
Hell of a risk you took today.
Something I had to do.
Care to tell me why?
President Adar once said...
that the interesting thing
about being a President...
is that you don't have to explain yourself
to anyone.
Something wrong?
No. Nothing at all.
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica...
I notice you're calling her Sharon now.
She acts like them, thinks like them.
She's one of them.
But she's one of us.
We gotta go, now.
We gotta travel fast. Even faster than before.
They found him
in the storage compartment.
He's another copy of the Cylon
you know as Leoben.
I'll send a team over to destroy it.
Anything it says cannot be trusted.
- Don't!
- Adama is a Cylon.
Commander? Here's Dr. Baltar's report.
And the President is waiting for you
up in the core.
Thank you.
Clear the deck.
Madame President,
we are the proud owners...
of the universe's first,
bona-fide Cylon detector.
That is great news.
Yeah.
So, when do we begin?
Dr. Baltar would like to start
widespread testing as soon as possible...
but there are some serious limitations.
He can only do one person at a time,
and verification takes hours.
So who's going to go first?
The tests. Right.
I think people in sensitive positions
should go first.
I completely agree. How about you?
Excuse me?
If you're a Cylon, I'd like to know.
If I'm a Cylon, you're really screwed.
Seriously, I do think that you should go first.
Show everyone in the fleet
that they can trust the people at the top.
Then maybe you should go first.
All right, I'll go first.
I think that's good. I do.
Bank on my advice.
- They always do that?
- No, they're just showing off.
They know I'm in here.
You date a special assistant
to the President, word gets out.
So this is officially a date?
Jury's still out.
Observation deck
has two minutes remaining.
You could pull rank.
You could tell them you're on special
business for the President of the Colonies.
Your boss pulls more weight around here
than mine.
- You can tell them Adama wants you to...
- Yeah, what? Wants me to what?
I lost my train of thought.
How is he these days, by the way?
- The old man? He's fine, I guess.
- You guess?
He's been acting kind of funny lately.
Seems distracted or something.
He's been making all these weird calls
from his quarters. Super secret.
- Probably a security thing.
- They don't want me to log the calls, though.
No trace file. Nothing.
- And this just started?
- A few days ago.
Billy Keikeya, are you pumping me
for information about the old man?
Time's up.
- No. Of course not.
- You are.
- You are. You're a spy, that's what you are.
- I was just asking a couple of questions.
I hope you liked the answers.
Because they're the last ones
you're gonna get for a while.
What did you find out?
Dualla couldn't put her finger on it...
but, yeah, she said
he's been acting differently.
I could see that myself. He was distracted
and unfocused. What else?
Some scrambled wireless calls
he didn't want logged.
She didn't know who he called or why.
But none of this is damning evidence.
The calls could be security-related...
and his odd behaviour could be stress,
pure and simple.
- Exhaustion, paranoia...
- All right. It could be any of those things.
But what if it's not?
Madame President, with all due respect...
I cannot believe we're actually
entertaining the idea...
that Commander Adama...
has been somehow replaced
by a Cylon duplicate.
Oh, my gods, Billy...
I hope you're right.
Is suicide really a sin?
A mortal one, I'm afraid.
But it's not that bad, is it, Gaius?
47,905 people in the fleet.
47,905 blood samples.
Eleven hours to test each one
for Cylon indicators.
That'll take awhile.
21,956 days.
60.1534 years.
Now, let's figure in a few hours
to sleep here and there.
We'll call it an even 61, shall we?
Sure.
I prefer to kill myself.
Commander Adama, are you a Cylon?
Tune in tomorrow.
It's hard being a genius.
Yes.
There should be some perks.
Yes.
What's up, Doc?
Lt. Thrace, good to see you. I was just...
keeping up with the old exercises.
That should do me for today.
I feel all better.
What brings you to the lab
at this time of the night?
It's mid-afternoon.
Yeah, it is.
Crazy workload. I totally lose track of time.
So, what can I do for you?
You can zip up your fly.
- So...
- My blood test.
You're right about one thing, Gaius.
There is something very intriguing about her.
Very good. Very good.
At least I did that much.
Dradis, contact!
- Cylon Raider bearing 738 carom 005.
- Galactica, Apollo.
- Action stations.
- Cylon Raider bearing 738 carom 005.
- Relative zero.
- Close with enemy, destroy. Acknowledge.
We're on it, Galactica.
He jumped right in front of us. His mistake.
- How many?
- Single Raider. Looks like a recon patrol.
Apollo and Beehive have them in their sight.
Where's the old man?
He's not aboard.
- Not aboard? Where the hell is he?
- He left in a Raptor about an hour ago.
No flight plan.
No flight plan?
That's it.
You set him up, I'll knock him down.
I winged him.
Looks like I got his weapon systems.
He jumped.
He jumped away before
we could zero him out.
Damn it. Probably giving away our position
to every Cylon base ship right now.
Where in the hell is the old man?
Order the fleet
to execute emergency jump procedures.
Everyone rendezvous
at the stand-by coordinates.
Contact!
Single Raider bearing 881 carom 247.
Apollo, Galactica,
Cylon Raider detected at 881 carom 24...
Wait, I see him! Same Raider.
What?
It's the same Raider.
I can see the damage from before.
It's behaving erratically.
He jumped away again.
Contact. Single Raider, same telltales.
- It's like he's just flying around in circles.
- Wounded bird. Can't fly home.
Galactica. We got him
on Dradis, but he's pretty far out there.
Take us three minutes
to close to weapons range.
No. This is our perfect chance
to get some intel.
Order Apollo to close with the Raider,
but do not engage.
Put a Raptor in the air.
As long as that's flopping around out there...
tell them I want to suck in
every electronic signal it makes.
Sir. Colonel, Commander Adama's Raptor
is requesting permission...
to enter the landing pattern.
Permission granted.
Stand down to Condition Two.
Permission granted.
Mr. Gaeta, you have the deck.
Permission to come aboard?
Granted.
Mind telling me
where the hell you've been?
Col. Tigh, allow me to present your wife.
Ellen?
That noise. I don't get it.
I've blown Centurions away before.
They've never sent an entire army after me.
They're after me.
Why you?
While they were holding me,
I overheard some things.
What?
Plans. Deployments.
There's a big Cylon base at Delphi.
A major hub.
Delphi? Frakking bastards.
The best place to try and grab
a ship and get off this frakking planet.
Dr. Gaius Baltar,
Department of Cylon Detection...
how may I direct your call?
You're in a good mood.
Madame President...
I'm sorry. I was expecting someone else.
We haven't spoken in ages.
Doctor, I'd like you to call me the moment
Commander Adama's test is complete.
Will you do that?
Commander Adama cancelled his test
a short time ago.
- Why?
- I don't know.
He gave me another sample.
He said it had priority.
- Whose?
- I'll just check.
Some woman called Ellen.
No surname. He dropped it off and left.
Is there a problem?
Dr. Baltar, I would like
you to resume testing...
Commander Adama's blood sample
immediately. Thank you.
- I can't believe you're alive.
- I can't believe it myself.
Saul, I don't remember the last few weeks.
It's weeks, right?
Right.
You've been on the Rising Star all this time?
I guess so.
The last thing I remember is being on Picon.
I was at the airport buying a ticket home...
and hearing something about the Cylons.
And then just dreams, mostly dreams...
until a couple days ago.
They tell me I was knocked out
when the Cylons attacked the airport.
And someone just picked me up...
and put me on the last flight out.
Some saviour. I don't even know who.
It's all right. You're here now.
It's like we found
a treasure chest.
One of the major issues we've been having...
with the Raider we captured
is to figure the faster-than-light drive.
This wounded bird is jumping
all over the place out there.
Yeah. And every time it jumps,
it gives us more data that we can use.
But what was it doing out there,
and how long can it keep it up?
The moment you have your FTL data,
give me an update.
Let's not let this thing linger out there
longer than we have to.
Yes, sir.
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Stay on it.
You have dinner plans?
- What?
- Come on.
I never thought I'd see you again.
Me neither.
The things I said before, the things I did...
In the past? It's all in the past.
- Start over?
- Start over.
- I... I can't.
- Forget it...
I can't. I'm on duty.
XO. Now?
Understood. All right. Tell her I'm on my way.
Girlfriend?
- Official business.
- Feels like old times.
- I'd explain, but...
- It's classified.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
I'll be here, waiting.
As soon as I can.
You want to be very, very careful
with what you just said.
You're talking about a man I owe my life to,
many times over.
I know these are uncertain times...
and this has been
a difficult transition for you.
Excuse me, Colonel.
I do appreciate how difficult this is
for you to hear, believe me.
But I would advise you right now
not to say anything that you will regret.
I need to know if you have seen
anything suspicious...
- about his recent behaviour?
- No.
What about the fact
that he left the Galactica...
without telling anyone where he was going
or when he would return...
and at that very moment,
a Cylon Raider jumped into view...
- and started acting strangely?
- I know exactly where he was.
You do?
He was picking up my wife.
Your wife?
Turns out she's been unconscious
aboard the Rising Star ever since the attack.
Oh, my gods!
That's fantastic. That's amazing.
Yes, it is.
When Ellen stepped off that shuttle,
I thought I was going to pass out.
Ellen?
- Your wife's name is Ellen?
- Yes, it is.
Ellen. Ellen Tigh.
I'd very much like to meet your wife, Colonel.
Resume the test on Ellen?
No, it's no trouble at all.
Ellen?
- Did you shut the door?
- I already did.
- Surprise.
- Ambrosia? Where did you get this?
I have my ways.
I thought it might be just the thing
for a little celebration.
- We need to talk.
- First things first.
There.
- Starting over.
- Starting over.
- I'm technically still on duty.
- I think they can do without you for a day.
It doesn't really work that way.
Starting over.
Sure, there's whining and complaining
like you would expect...
but the people I talked to
are mostly hopeful and optimistic.
That's good to hear.
There are a few people
who still might wonder...
if a kindergarten teacher
is really the right person to be President...
but they're just a tiny minority.
Wonderful.
Everyone is so truly grateful
to all of you on Galactica.
- You literally are our saviours.
- We're just doing our jobs.
You are so modest.
He's always been that way.
Lee, could I trouble you
for a little more of this lovely Ambrosia?
- Sure.
- Thank you, dear.
Bill, you must be so proud of your sons.
Lee here has grown
into such a handsome man.
I can only imagine
what Zak must look like now.
You are the spitting image of your mother...
and I bet Zak takes just after his daddy.
Zak passed away
a couple of years ago.
I'm sorry. How tragic, the death of a child.
There's been so much death, so much pain.
Sometimes it's completely overwhelming.
I'm sure he was a beautiful boy.
The Captain of the Rising Star
was puzzled as to how you got on his ship.
I know. I know some thoughtful soul
just rescued me...
from almost certain death,
and put me on the last flight out of Picon.
- How lucky for us all.
- Yes, indeed.
The strange thing is no one can recall...
giving you any medical assistance
until about a week ago.
I know.
It's a miracle I'm alive.
I think I better clear
some of these dishes.
- You are so sweet.
- Very good. My compliments to the chef.
So, Bill, now the question
on everyone's mind...
and I do mean everyone...
Sorry.
It's okay.
...is where is Earth
and when do we get there?
- That's classified information.
- That word again.
Leave the man alone.
Come on, if there are no privileges
of being an XO's wife...
then what's the point?
Bill, we're all family here. Come on.
The need for secrecy is paramount, Ellen.
I'm sorry. Perhaps you don't know
that the Cylons look like us now.
That, yes, I knew that.
It's recent news.
Most people found out a few days ago.
A thing like that would travel fast. Right?
Any one of us could be a Cylon.
Boo!
Did you see the looks on their faces?
- You are too easy.
- Thank you so much for coming.
It's been a wonderful evening.
Thought it would never end.
I seemed to have lost one of my shoes.
- I think it's right here.
- Thank you.
Here we are.
- You look very, very happy.
- That's because I am very happy.
Thank you.
- It was nice to see you again.
- The pleasure's all mine.
- Hope to see you soon.
- I'm sure you will.
Hang on.
Watch your step.
- Good night.
- Lovely dinner.
I've got her.
Be careful.
You actually think that woman is a Cylon?
If she's not, then we're all in a lot of trouble.
When did Bill become
such a stick-in-the-mud?
The man's a carving.
He's one of those faces on a totem pole.
She slept with more than half the fleet,
while Saul was in space.
Why the hell did he stay married to her?
- It's obvious. He loves her deeply.
- Blindly.
Ellen used to encourage
the worst instincts in this guy...
- bring out this self-destructive streak in him.
- Used to?
Sharon, stop! I can't keep up.
Helo, come on.
You can do it. Please.
You have to get up.
There. Right there.
Turn your light off.
We gotta find another way out of here.
We're going.
Why aren't you waiting?
You keep going and going.
- You never get tired.
- It's adrenaline.
I'm not gonna die here.
And I'm not gonna let you die here either.
Okay, let's go!
Don't worry, I'll get us home.
Yeah, right.
- Just like Bill's getting us to Earth.
- Don't start on Bill.
He doesn't have the slightest idea
where Earth is.
You don't have to yell it through the halls.
Bill Adama doesn't know where Earth is!
- Colonel.
- Doctor.
Actually, I don't believe
I've had the pleasure.
- I'm Dr. Gaius...
- Baltar. I know exactly who you are.
And the pleasure's all mine.
Something here, isn't there?
You're still holding my hand.
That's funny.
I thought you were still holding onto mine.
I'm watching you. Both of you.
And you should be watching her.
Care to join us for a nightcap, Doctor?
I'd love to.
Dr. Baltar,
report to the lab. The Commander is waiting.
- But I can't. Another time, perhaps.
- Count on it.
Ta-ta!
- Oh, Saulie, are you jealous?
- You said we were starting over.
We are, sweetheart, we are.
That was just a little harmless flirting.
You should know something.
What?
In the middle of dinner...
- Bill put his hand on my leg.
- Ellen, I'm not falling for this.
Did you know he came to see me
on the Rising Star?
What?
He'd come into my room.
I'd pretend to be asleep.
Then he'd sit by the side of my bed...
- and then he'd touch me.
- Why are you doing this? You're lying.
I am not. He was on that ship.
I'll prove it.
Come on!
Look, it's not magic. It's science.
If you want the right result,
you have to wait awhile.
I gave you her sample this morning.
I have started and stopped
the test twice already now...
so I'm running a little behind.
- Twice?
- My fault. Long story.
Your fault?
- I shouldn't have mentioned that.
- You shouldn't have.
- Did you tell him to stop Ellen's test?
- Yes, I did.
- Why?
- I had some concerns.
About what?
In all honesty, I think it's fair to say
that your behaviour recently has been odd.
My behaviour? What do you think,
I'm a Cylon? Me?
You can't deny
that you've been making these...
off-log calls, these mysterious trips
off the ship.
Where did you hear that?
Have you been spying on me?
On my own ship?
Ladies and gentlemen, please.
We're in a laboratory.
There are hazardous
chemical compounds everywhere.
That's a thermo-nuclear bomb,
for frak's sakes.
What do you mean "un-logged"?
"Mysterious trips"? What's going on?
I had to go to the Rising Star
and I didn't want Tigh to know.
Why not?
Because whether or not his wife is a Cylon,
she's trouble...
and I wanted to keep her away
as long as I could.
Then why did you bring her aboard the ship?
Because she's his wife.
And I couldn't refuse her access...
to her own husband
without causing suspicion.
Besides, I wanted her close to me.
I told you. I told you he wanted me.
- Lovely.
- What the hell's going on?
You have been secretly visiting my wife?
No. Yes. But it's complicated.
- I told you. He's been after me for years.
- What?
Now boys, boys, don't fight
over little old me.
- Ellen, be quiet!
- You don't tell me what to do.
We should all take a deep breath.
I will!
I was afraid that she might be a Cylon!
I brought her blood here to test it.
That's why you cancelled your test.
How'd you know that?
You didn't tell me
he was testing my wife.
- You met with the President?
- Yes. She thought you might be a Cylon.
I know.
Attention. Pass the word
for the Commander, XO and the CAG.
Commander Adama, Col. Tigh,
and Captain Adama, please report to CIC.
Mr. Gaeta.
The Raider smoothed out
its flight path about two minutes ago.
It seems to be under control.
- Yeah, but he's not jumping for home.
- No, sir, he isn't.
Has our reconnaissance detected
any outgoing communications...
since he straightened out his flight pattern?
Yes, sir, but it's likely
it's just another distress signal.
Launch the alert fighters.
This is the CAG. Launch the alert fighters.
Sir, I hate to tell you this, but I think
it's been playing with us the entire time.
It was waiting to see how we'd react.
- Playing with us?
- Yeah.
- Order the flight leader to destroy the target!
- Yes, sir.
Galactica, Hot Dog. The Raider just took off!
He doesn't look injured to me.
He's heading back to the fleet!
- They're not going to catch him.
- Action Stations, set Condition One.
- This is not a drill.
- He doesn't have any weapons.
He's on a suicide run.
- Did you launch the alert fighters?
- It was the XO's call.
- I had a hunch.
- Good call.
- One question.
- Because I was worried.
- That she might be a Cylon.
- And if she wasn't.
I know how you feel about her, Saul.
She's been a negative force in your life.
I'm sorry, but it's the truth.
Maybe she was.
Everything was different then.
She was different. I was different.
I've grown accustomed to seeing you
without the cup in your hand.
So I had a couple of drinks tonight.
- I was celebrating. I think I deserved to...
- Yes, you did.
Launching those fighters on a hunch.
You saved our ship.
Just doing my job.
You do your job good.
That's why I need you, Saul.
That, and that we're friends.
I don't want anything to come between that,
not even Ellen.
It won't.
We've searched every street,
every building.
They slipped through. How's that possible?
She thinks she loves him.
Now that she can't live without him.
Her passion is making her more resourceful.
- Bothers you, doesn't it?
- We'll get them in the end.
No, it bothers you
that you've never experienced it.
You saw the way Helo was
when we took her away?
He was pathetic.
I can't help wondering what it would be like
to feel that intensely.
Even in his anguish, he seemed so alive.
Green. Green, everyone.
Mrs. Tigh is definitely human.
- No hard feelings, I hope, Ellen.
- I completely understand.
But let's be sure and test you next.
- Doctor?
- My pleasure. My job.
You don't want to frak with me, Bill.
Try to remember that.
Don't frak with me either, Ellen.
If only they knew
that everyone passes these days.
Why, it's so much simpler that way.
No muss, no fuss.
What did her test really say?
I'll never tell.
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.
Your doctor back on Caprica
was right.
It's too damn late to operate,
the cancer is too far advanced.
Have you ever heard of Chamalla extract?
It means that you're still acting
like you're everyone's best friend.
We're not friends, you're the CAG.
The Chief wanted me
to kick your ass out of bed.
But, clearly, you still need the rest.
Take your time. No rush.
I need new pilots.
And I want you to train them.
I can do that.
They slipped through. How's that possible?
She thinks she loves him.
Now that she can't live without him.
- Bothers you, doesn't it?
- We'll get them in the end.
I can assure you that fuel shortage
is our number one priority.
Galactica has ships
scouring the nearby star systems...
and we can anticipate
that they will soon find tylium.
Hamilton?
Madam President,
tylium ore is extremely rare.
If we don't find any,
how long before the fleet runs out of fuel?
That all depends on how well we conserve.
Isn't it a fact, Ma'am President, that we
only have enough for two more jumps?
Yes. That is correct.
Do we have a contingency plan
if we run out of tylium?
We would...
If that were to happen...
we would use our last fuel...
to jump to the nearest planetary system.
And pray we're lucky enough
to find a habitable planet.
Madam President, without fuel to take
even the most basic evasive manoeuvres...
No...
wouldn't we be like ducks
in a Cylon shooting gallery?
Yes, we would.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
That is all for now.
She did not do this.
Commencing sweep 87 of asteroid field.
Any luck?
How many times are you gonna
ask me that, Boomer?
Well, until you find some tylium ore.
Don't you want to be a hero
to Ensign Davis?
You haven't noticed how
she always sits next to you in the mess?
"How's it going, Crash?
You look so cute."
Damn it. There's so much debris
in this system, the dradis is useless.
This is going to take 100 years.
I heard about how you found
water, how you saved the whole place...
Jackpot, Boomer. That asteroid dead ahead
is a mountain of tylium.
Check it.
Thank the Gods! We're heroes. Yeah.
"We're heroes." It never fails.
Great, the second that I score,
the bus driver jumps in and takes the credit.
- Okay, so who's the one that we suggest...
- What?
Cylons.
The rock's crawling with them.
We are well and truly fracked.
Only tylium within 12 light years
and we've got to kiss it goodbye.
Yeah, along with our asses
if we don't get out of here fast.
It figures the Cylons would be sitting
on the only source of fuel within our reach.
Still staking out every waterhole
in the desert.
Only this time it's a lake, enough tylium
to last us a couple of years.
This must be
some kind of conveyor belt...
to get the ore from the mine here
into this cracking plant here.
A refinery this far
from their home world?
Why not?
They need fuel as much as we do.
Now they've got it.
And enough firepower to keep it.
All right. So we forget
this asteroid, find another source.
You can bet your ass
the Cylons will be guarding that one, too.
We send the Raptors out farther.
Find a source they haven't reached yet.
We'll use up all our fuel doing it.
How're we going to get our refinery ship...
We take the tylium from the Cylons.
With all respect, this is hardly a time
to attack a superior force.
This is exactly the time.
We know where they are.
They don't know where we are.
We'll catch them with their pants down.
If we fail?
End of game.
So we don't fail.
When the missile
gets close enough...
you'll be pulling maybe 7 G's.
But to catch you,
the bastard's gonna have to pile on 40 to 60.
Its guidance system can't hack it,
and it'll miss...
most of the time.
Exactly how often is "most of the time"?
It depends on your judgment,
and how well you pray.
Attention on deck.
As you were.
Lt. Thrace, can I have a word?
Of course. Take five, guys.
What's up?
How are they doing?
Wobbly as newborn colts,
but they're getting stronger.
That's good.
Got a job for you.
Rumour mill has it
that you're planning an op.
Rumour mill's right for a change.
Capt. Adama and Col. Tigh
are working up the plan now...
and I need some serious
out-of-the-box thinking.
Out-of-the-box is where I live.
I've been taking Chamalla
for a medical condition.
So what have you seen?
It started out as dreams
of the Cylon that we had executed.
But I had the dreams
before we captured him.
- The images were...
- Prescient?
Uncanny.
And now I'm seeing things while I'm awake.
- What kind of things?
- Snakes.
There were snakes crawling all over
my podium during a press conference.
- How many?
- About a dozen.
You're kidding, right?
You read Pythia,
and now you're having me on.
No.
- Who is Pythia?
- One of the oracles in the sacred scrolls.
3,600 years ago...
Pythia wrote about the exile
and the rebirth of the human race.
And the Lords anointed a leader...
to guide the caravan of the heavens
to their new homeland.
And unto the leader they gave a vision...
of serpents, numbering two and ten...
as a sign of things to come.
Pythia wrote that?
She also wrote that the new leader suffered
a wasting disease...
and would not live to enter the new land.
But you're not dying. Are you?
And that will allow the attack force
to wipe out these installations here.
Now, if we do it right,
there won't be any Cylon survivors.
And the asteroid will be ours.
What do you think, Starbuck?
It's a textbook perfect plan,
which is why it won't work.
Of course. We bow to your
vast experience in strategic planning.
Refresh my memory. What year was it
that you graduated from war college?
What's the matter,
married life not all you expected?
Enough. Both of you.
We're not going to win this one by the book.
I want Starbuck in here...
because she's not weighed down
by conventional thinking.
All due respect, gentlemen,
we're not as crazy as she is.
Okay. So what would you do differently?
To start...
jumping Galactica in behind the planetoid...
to hide it from the Cylon base
is an obvious move.
You think they'll be covering that blind spot
with recon patrols?
I would, if I were them.
What we need to do is make their patrols
part of our plan, you know?
Make their tactics work for us.
Here's what I would do:
At position code Deacon...
we'll need three civilian freighter ships
to use as decoys.
Which means those passengers
will have to be relocated to other ships...
which are already overcrowded.
Yes, if you approve.
The decoy ships
will jump into the enemy star system...
at extreme radar range
from the Cylon asteroid.
Galactica will jump here...
close enough to launch its Vipers
at the base.
Soon as the decoy freighters arrive
in the system, they'll break wireless silence.
They'll be posing as a mining fleet
coming after the tylium...
and pretend to be unaware
of the Cylon presence.
The Cylons will hear
the messages...
and send a force of Raiders after them.
This will leave the base
relatively undefended.
We'll have Raptors pre-positioned
to keep an eye on the Cylons.
When the Cylons
move toward the decoys...
Galactica's Vipers will come in from behind,
and obliterate the base.
Without the base,
they'll be unable to rearm, refuel.
We'll mop them up,
and then we'll take the tylium.
What happens to the crews
on the civilian decoy ships?
They'll keep their FTL drives spooled up,
and jump clear the first sign of trouble.
How many casualties do you anticipate?
lt'll cost us.
If you succeed, what's to prevent the Cylons
from coming back with reinforcements?
Nothing.
But if we get a chance
to knock out that base...
it will buy us some time.
Why?
If you keep running
from the schoolyard bully...
he keeps on chasing you.
But when you turn around and stop...
and you punch him really hard
in a sensitive spot...
he'll think twice about coming back again.
So it's either this,
or run out of fuel and be annihilated.
Sometimes you have to roll the hard six.
Well, the freighters are yours.
Good hunting, everyone.
Operation starts in 48 hours.
This is our target.
A Cylon base?
And you're the Cylon expert.
We need to destroy
their military facilities.
Without harming the tylium ore
under the surface.
Exactly.
A nuke would destroy the Cylons.
But the radiation
would render the ore inert, unusable.
I see your dilemma.
Well, you're in luck, you know.
Refined tylium
contains tremendous enthalpy...
to the order of half a billion
mega joules per kilo.
Subjected to right heat and compression,
say, from a conventional warhead...
you should get
a suitably devastating explosion...
without the radioactive fallout.
All we have to do is hit the right spot.
Specifically, you must hit the staging tanks
for the refined tylium precursor.
It's a lot more unstable than the fuel itself.
And where would they be?
I need your advice on this one.
I'm flattered, Gaius...
but I don't know
the first thing about tylium refineries.
Neither do I.
Oh, come on, you must have an inkling...
- where I should tell them to bomb?
- No.
But God does.
Oh, good.
I suppose God doesn't want me
to destroy the base...
because he's the Cylon God. Right?
God doesn't take sides.
He only wants your love.
Open your heart to him,
and he'll show you the way.
It'd be a lot simpler
if he came out and told me.
You must remember to surrender your ego.
Remain humble.
If you ask me...
God could do with cleaning his ears out.
Then he'd hear what I have to say.
- Relax your neck.
- Why? What are you going to do?
I said relax.
All right, but please don't...
Where
would the staging tanks be, Doctor?
There. Right there.
Hit any one of them and the place
will go up like a three kiloton bomb.
Well done.
Forceful, so decisive,
delivered with such élan.
He didn't speak to me.
God didn't speak to me.
I was totally lying.
I just picked that spot at random.
He doesn't always speak in words, Gaius.
So the fate...
of the entire human race
depends upon my wild guess.
Attention on deck.
As you were.
How's the knee, Starbuck?
lt'll be ready. I'm not missing this party.
Apollo's leading the strike force.
You'll have to sit this one out.
- I'm the best pilot that you have.
- Not right now.
In combat, you got to pull 6, 7 G's.
Doc says your knee won't take it.
- Well, then he's wrong.
- Is he?
A Viper thruster pedal...
requires this much force...
to activate.
Now you're on your attack run.
They launch their missiles...
so you've got to jam that pedal...
into the firewall...
and hold a 6 G turn...
for 10 seconds or you die.
10, 9, 8...
7, 6, 5, 4.
This is only 3 G's, Starbuck. Not 6.
I'm sorry. It's a tough one.
But you're staying home.
Keep your ingress low and fast.
Use the terrain to stay hidden
till the last second.
Make sure you give
the flak suppression unit enough time...
so they can weaken defences.
You don't think I'm up to this?
Of course I do.
You'll be fine.
Look, you're worried that
I'm not gonna pull it out of the fire...
with some high-risk retina-detaching move...
the way Starbuck would.
Look, Kara, I'm sorry you're not suiting up.
'Cause everyone would feel so much better,
me included...
if you were riding along with us.
But this isn't an ego trip. This is my job.
And don't think for one moment
that I will not get it done.
I hope so. Because we've got one shot.
Don't frack it up by over-thinking.
Nice thing about being on the run
after a nuclear war...
nobody left to complain if we hide out
in their barn or raid their pantry...
while you're on your way to steal a ship,
and get off the planet.
- It's odd, isn't it?
- What?
That we haven't seen
a single living human being...
since the one you shot
when you rescued me.
We're still alive. Why nobody else?
Probably holed up
in the fallout shelters or something.
Two ways out and a lovely view.
What could be better?
A feather bed with a silk comforter.
You hungry?
I don't know. What do we got?
Peanut butter...
baked beans, corn...
How about some chilli?
A simple "no" would do.
Sharon, have you been taking
your anti-radiation meds?
I think it was those cold beans
we had this afternoon.
- You okay now?
- Yeah.
How far you figure to Delphi?
Eight, maybe ten days if we move fast.
If we start early, we can be there in no time.
Can't sleep?
I couldn't either before a big op.
The Mark II.
Good ship.
Got me out of
a lot of tough scrapes.
I've got something for you.
It belonged to your grandfather.
My mum bought it for him
when he was in law school.
You see the engraving on it?
Yeah, I can barely make it out, but...
He was a better father than I was.
Dad used to carry that into court cases.
Claimed he never lost
unless he left it behind.
So you're worried, too?
About what?
You know, sometimes it feels
like the whole ship...
thinks Starbuck would do better.
I don't.
How can you be so sure?
Because you're my son.
Get some rest.
You're going to need it.
Dad...
I'll bring it back.
You'd better, or I'll kick your ass.
It's a good lighter.
Sharon. Wake up.
What the frack! You killed her...
Let me see.
We gotta go. Right now.
Wait a minute. I saw her on my lap.
I saw her blood spill on my lap.
Let's move, mister.
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know. We'll figure it out later.
Jump complete, sir.
Dradis reports nothing but hash.
Just as we expected. Can't see a thing.
We are now within launch range
of the Cylon base.
... Constellation
jump complete on station, point Deacon.
Initiate search pattern, Delta.
Ore flight Bravo.
Delta, Wilco.
Ore flight Nebula,
Delta initiated.
The ball's in play.
You can bet they heard that.
Now they'll try to locate the decoys.
And when they do?
If they take the bait, all hell breaks loose.
- Until then?
- We wait.
Galactica, Boomer.
Tally, 90 plus, headed Deacon.
Speed, 250.
The Cylons have seen
the freighter. They're en route to intercept it.
They took the bait.
- Mr. Gaeta, launch Strike Force 1.
- Aye, sir.
D, launch strike force one.
Attention. Pilots, man your planes.
Pilots, man your planes.
- How hard did they bite?
- Boomer's report said 90 plus.
They've launched most of their fighter force.
Give them hell, sir.
Firing.
Attack forces away.
I just hope that Lee can...
Lee isn't the problem.
You should take a good look at yourself.
I had to go through the same transition.
When you're in the cockpit,
you're in control.
It's hard to give it up.
It would just be a lot easier
if I was flying with them.
All you can do now is wait,
and hope you didn't make any mistakes.
I never wanted this kind of responsibility.
The Cylons never asked us what we wanted.
Welcome to the big leagues.
Galactica,
Crashdown.
Tally, 50 plus on an intercept course.
Repeat. 50 plus inbound.
What's that mean?
It means that a Cylon patrol
spotted our attack force.
The base sent out
50 more Raiders to intercept.
Fifty Raiders?
That means we're outnumbered now 5-to-1?
Weren't the decoys
supposed to take care of that?
- The Cylons were too smart for that.
- Frack.
Estimated time to strike intercept, 2 minutes.
Fireball...
multiple bandits, left 10 high, range 40.
Weapons free. Committing.
Hot Dog, visual tally, press.
Hot Dog, break right.
Fireball, your six.
I'm hit. Man eject.
Stop!
Deadbolt, Spinner.
Two bandits closing your right side.
No joy!
Galactica, Hot Dog.
Heavily engaged. Mission outcome doubtful.
- This sounds fracking awful.
- They're getting cut to pieces out there.
Get out of there! Move!
Deadbolt,
right vertical, now!
Diamond, get a shot.
Get him off me.
Mr. Gaeta, abort Strike 1.
Strike One, Galactica.
Return to base.
Repeat. Abort your mission,
and return to base.
Galactica, Stubb.
Cylon strike force is turning away
from Deacon and inbound to Galactica.
Noting Raiders inbound.
The Cylons heard our transmission recall,
didn't they?
Does that mean the first wave of Raiders...
is ignoring the decoys,
and is coming after us?
That's exactly what it means.
So, when are we going to launch
the reserve Vipers to defend Galactica?
There are no reserve Vipers.
Everything is on the board already.
Now we play for all the marbles.
Starbuck, it's your plan.
Mr. Gaeta...
will you please tell D to get on the scrambler
and inform Apollo the back door is open?
Aye, Lieutenant.
D, please send
a scrambler to Capt. Apollo.
Message reads, "The back door is open."
Apollo, Galactica. Back door is open.
Godspeed, Apollo.
Lt. Thrace, why didn't you tell me...
we had another attack force
hidden in the freighters?
We...
It was my decision.
I routinely restrict tactical details
to those who need to know.
Old habits die hard.
So you still might pull this off?
If Dr. Baltar's target information
is correct.
And whether we get blown to pieces
by those Cylon Raiders...
heading toward us right now.
Speaking of which, I'm needed in CIC.
Initial point in 5 seconds.
Flak suppression unit cleared hot.
Okay, let's do this.
Come on, Lee. It's all on you.
Incoming!
Weapons free.
By the numbers, people.
Target acquired. Tone and lock.
Firing.
Tone and lock. Firing.
What's got into these fracking missiles?
Come on.
They're jamming the guidance systems.
Strike two, Apollo.
Then we get close enough
so we don't need the guidance systems.
We'll have to blow this thing
manually.
Wilco, Apollo. Rolling in.
Chuckles!
Oh, frack.
Chuckles bought it. He's going down!
Now they've got
our attack axis zeroed in.
There's no way to fracking get close.
There's gotta be.
We've got to get out of this flak.
Let's get down below deck,
down where the target is.
I've got an idea.
I'm gonna take a closer look.
Commander on deck.
As you were.
The first wave of Cylons will be on us
in three minutes.
Notify the Strike 1 Vipers...
that they can stop running
and blast those bastards to hell.
Yes, sir.
Attacking Cylon fighters.
Target acquired, tone and lock.
Oh, no, don't do this, Lee.
The conveyor tunnel's clear.
I'm going through it.
You're out of your fracking mind, Apollo.
What's going on?
Captain Apollo's flying
into the conveyor tunnel...
hoping it will lead him to the refinery.
Has he gone raving mad?
There's no way to ensure
it does anything of the kind.
Come on, keep it together, Lee.
Oh, lords.
Okay, I'm through the tunnel.
They can't get a firing solution on me.
There you are.
Okay. I've got you. I've got you.
Galactica, Apollo.
Mission accomplished.
Yes.
You can tell Dr. Baltar
he was right on the money.
It's one hell of a fireworks show.
And there's plenty more for us
back in the canyon...
once this place is history.
Congratulations, Doctor, it worked.
It did.
It worked.
I'm sorry, Madam President, I'm sorry.
No need to apologise.
Thanks to you, we have enough fuel
to last us a few years.
Commander, Strike 1 reports
inbound Cylons are bugging out.
Request permission to go after them, sir.
- Tell our people to pursue and destroy them.
- Affirmative.
Strike 1, tear them up.
Apollo, you magnificent bastard.
That was one hell of a piece of flying
and I couldn't have done it better myself.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
I said that I couldn't have
done it better myself.
Well, thank you.
I had my doubts.
So did I.
I wasn't sure that crazy ass plan of yours
would even possibly work.
You deserve this.
Crash.
Have you read the Pythian Prophecy,
Gaius?
Not since the 6th grade.
I can't say ancient history
is my favourite subject.
You should have paid
closer attention.
To what?
"All of this has happened before.
All of this will happen again."
Everyone knows that verse.
What are you getting at?
Remember this one?
"Led by serpents numbering two and ten."
The Vipers, they're the serpents?
There's a later verse, Gaius.
You should read it.
"Though the outcome favoured the few...
"it led to a confrontation
at the home of the gods."
Are you telling me that God
guided my finger to that target for some...
arcane scriptural purpose?
You are part of God's plan, Gaius.
So God wanted me
to destroy the Cylon base.
You did well. You gave yourself over to Him.
Yes, I suppose I did.
There's really no other
logical explanation for it.
- I was...
- Am.
I am an instrument of God.
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.
What the hell is going on?
You killed her.
We gotta go. Right now.
That's Tom Zarek.
The terrorist?
He's a prisoner of conscience.
He's a butcher.
He blew up a government building,
there is no excuse for that.
I thought you said you respected me.
That was before you resorted
to violence and hostage-taking.
I demand the immediate resignation
of Laura Roslin and her ministers.
I demand free and open elections
to choose a new leadership.
If you let the rest of these hostages go,
we will leave this ship in your hands.
Got it?
Test. There.
Are we on?
Frack, we're on. Go.
Live from Cloud Nine,
the most luxurious ship in the fleet...
it's The Colonial Gang.
It's a new talk show that brings you
the inside scoop on the fleet.
I'm James McManus,
formerly of the Caprica Times.
With me are two of the only remaining
legitimate journalists left.
Playa Palacios, veteran commentator
for the Picon Star Tribune. Welcome.
And my wingman, Sekou Hamilton,
former editor of the Aerilon Gazette.
As most
people know...
Cloud Nine was damaged
during a Cylon attack...
and had to be evacuated.
With repairs now complete,
President Roslin has picked it as the site...
for an historic gathering.
It's the first meeting
of the Interim Quorum of 12...
which will coincide with Colonial Day...
the 52nd anniversary of the signing
of the Articles of Colonisation.
Playa, why don't you weigh in?
Laura Roslin should be applauded...
for restoring
the system of checks and balances.
Every delegate chosen so far
has been a Roslin crony.
It's a puppet Quorum, okay?
That will rubber-stamp every edict
this power-mad schoolteacher will try...
How can you say that when half the Quorum
hasn't even been selected?
I predict every one of them
will be a Roslin lackey...
hand-picked by the power behind the throne,
Presidential Advisor, Wallace Gray.
Don't you see,
Gray orchestrated this whole publicity stunt.
Come on, Jim.
Wallace Gray is no prince of darkness.
I disagree.
He's helped Roslin
regulate the internal economy...
made sure vital food and medical supplies
were fairly distributed...
He's a gasbag who's made a fortune through
deals Quorum members have profited from.
Freedom of the press.
As we speak...
Madam President, the fatuous gasbag
would like 5 minutes of your time.
Wally.
How does it feel to be a celebrity?
Well, I love it.
They'll probably be calling me a fascist next.
No, I'm the fascist.
You stick with being the gasbag.
Madam President, excuse me,
you're going to want to hear this.
McMANUS:... Sagittaron have chosen their
delegate for the Interim Quorum of 12.
Who would've guessed it? Tom Zarek.
- Oh, my gods.
- He's got quite a following out there.
- I should have seen this coming.
- He's a terrorist. Who are they kidding?
McMANUS:... a ruthless terrorist.
Tom Zarek incited a prison riot
that resulted in kidnapping, attempted rape.
He blew up a government building and now
he's gonna sit on the Quorum of 12?
Wrong. The government
trumped up charges to discredit a man...
who's dedicated his life
for the disenfranchised.
Yes? Just a moment.
Commander Adama.
Why am I not surprised?
Hello, Commander.
Are you listening to this?
- Indeed.
- Can't allow a terrorist to sit in government.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to turn him into a martyr.
Sagittaron law allows a prisoner to regain
his citizenship once he's served his time.
Tom Zarek represents
a danger to the entire fleet.
I can bar him from travelling to Cloud Nine
on that basis alone.
I perfectly understand the threat
Tom Zarek represents.
But the last thing I need is for you to start
acting like my own personal goon squad.
We need to let this play out. Thank you.
Hold onto your shorts.
There's another story.
We're getting a live feed
from the Astral Queen.
Tom Zarek is about to make a statement.
Citizens of the 12 Colonies, I am
humbled and moved by this great honour.
I will be a voice
for those who have gone too long unheard...
by a government that serves
only the privileged and the powerful...
that turns a blind eye
to the needs of the weak and the poor.
But Roslin and her confederates
will no longer be able to ignore us.
People of the fleet,
look up. The winds of change are blowing.
A new era is about to dawn.
Hey, Doc.
Lt. Thrace, to what do I owe this honour?
Our shuttle leaves for Cloud Nine
at 05:12 tomorrow, so don't be late.
"Our" shuttle?
A surprise getaway? Just the two of you?
- I'm going to be handling your security.
- Please don't touch that. Thank you.
Security for what?
You haven't heard?
It's all over talk wireless.
When would I have the chance
to listen to talk wireless?
I have 60 years of work in front of me.
Anyway, talk wireless is just an excuse
for lowbrow rabble-rousing.
You've been selected as Caprica's delegate
to the Quorum of 12.
Me?
Is this some kind of joke?
Guess you got the super-genius vote.
No accounting for taste.
Congratulations, Doctor.
Thank you.
Politics is the only thing more boring
than blood samples.
All those interminable speeches.
All that dreary pomp.
Parties full of young women
drawn to men of power.
But when the people call, you must serve.
I can't remember the last time
I felt the sunlight on my face.
Sure feels good. Almost like the real thing.
They could've done a better job
with the horizon, though.
Security's going to be a bitch.
A thousand different places
for a sniper to hide.
How many people are we dealing with?
Five hundred plus.
Each colony's
sending a delegation of leading citizens.
Great. Herds of lookie-loos,
any one of whom could be a Cylon.
Toasters aren't our only problem.
Don't you pay any attention to politics?
- No.
- A lot of unrest out there.
So why is Roslin insisting
on letting so many people come?
I guess she thinks it's important to them...
to be able to observe
how their government works.
So basically,
she's already running for re-election.
No, Kara.
Kara, give me that.
Thank you, sir.
Enjoy your day.
The atmosphere is electric...
as Quorum members arrive
with their delegations.
I'm outside the Cloud Nine Ballroom...
where the reception of
the new Quorum of 12 will take place.
The question is, will President Roslin
shake the hand of the man...
many still regard as a terrorist...
or will she snub him, and by extension,
all the people of Sagittaron?
Col. Tigh.
- My wife Ellen.
- Welcome aboard.
Kill me now.
Col. Tigh.
Starbuck, Apollo. Zarek's here.
Copy.
Don't worry. This guy's mine
the second he makes a wrong move.
Yeah?
Well, you'll have to beat me to him.
Murderer. You don't belong here, Zarek.
Go back.
What did you say?
He's not a murderer, he's a freedom fighter.
All right?
Excuse me.
- May I see your security pass, sir?
- Not a problem.
I'm a citizen of Sagittaron.
I've got every legal right to be here.
Your rights don't extend
to roughing people up.
Lay a hand on anyone else and you'll be
getting to know Galactica's brig.
Well, everything's in order.
Enjoy your stay on Cloud Nine.
Oh, I will.
Tom Zarek.
Col. Tigh, Battlestar Galactica.
I see.
My wife.
- Does she have a name?
- Ellen.
Call me Tom.
I don't like to stand on ceremony.
I'm the same way.
All this pretension makes me sick.
You're holding up the line.
Thank you
for making me feel welcome, Ellen.
I hope to see you again.
Why did you do that?
To get our picture on the front page of every
newsletter and photo service in the fleet.
I don't need my picture taken with a terrorist.
Wake up, Saul. Look at these cameras.
Roslin's the past, Zarek's the future.
A blind man can see that.
Madam President.
Mr. Zarek.
If I were to offer you my hand in friendship...
would you take it?
Well, there's only one way to find out.
That was nicely played.
Thank you.
Just remember, I'm not your enemy,
Madam President.
And I know today's agenda
is rather large...
but I think that if you'll look
at the scheduled meetings...
you'll see that
they concern issues vital to the fleet.
In some cases, existing policies...
regarding matters such as
the distribution of medical supplies...
You're missing
an intriguing opportunity.
Playa's not wearing any underwear.
Don't be absurd.
Really?
She's been eyeing you all afternoon.
She's certainly human.
You're not jealous?
Love isn't about sex, Gaius.
That's an enlightened point of view.
I've been thinking...
as far as I'm concerned
you can have any woman you want.
But always remember...
I have your heart.
Yes. Of course you do.
I can always rip it out of your chest
if I need to.
So if there are no objections...
the Chair will entertain motions
to accept today's agenda as proposed.
I have an objection.
The chair recognises Sagittaron.
All the items on your agenda are important,
I agree.
Ration distribution, education,
medical services, all very important.
But I'm frankly shocked to discover...
the most critical issue of all
is nowhere to be found.
Really? Well, perhaps
Mr. Zarek could enlighten us?
The election of a vice-president.
lf, gods forbid, anything
should happen to you, Madam President...
we have no designated successor.
The civilian branch of our government
would be paralysed...
leaving the door wide open
for a military dictatorship.
Sagittaron moves that
the first item on the Quorum's agenda...
should be nominations for vice-president.
Second.
- Second.
- Second.
Caprica seconds for various reasons...
which are far too obvious
and numerous to go into right now.
But certainly, I think we can all agree
that it'd be a good idea to have a successor.
The motion has been moved and seconded.
All those in favour of opening nominations
for the vice-presidency, say aye.
Aye.
Aye.
The ayes have it.
The floor is now open for nominations.
The chair recognises Virgon.
Now, there is only one man here...
who is willing to work for the betterment
of people in this fleet.
When I asked for his help...
he sent a crew
to fix the air filtration system on my ship...
and, hell, they were finished and gone
while I was still waiting...
for the President's office to return my call.
I nominate Tom Zarek.
Thanks.
Is there a second?
Gemenon seconds the nomination.
The nomination of Tom Zarek
for the vice-presidency has been accepted.
The Chair will remain open for 72 hours
for nominations.
The session is now adjourned.
Thomas Zarek
is not going to be my vice-president.
Six months until the presidential election.
We could've handpicked a candidate.
It didn't shock me
when Bagot nominated him.
- But Porter, that was surprising.
- Not really.
The Gemenon ships use more water
per capita than any other ship.
She wanted more rations, I said no.
Zarek may have made some friends
in the last few weeks...
but there are still plenty who hate him.
Don't underestimate Zarek.
He's charismatic
and knows what buttons to push.
Frankly, Madam President, I am concerned
about the security aboard Cloud Nine.
I want you leaning forward
on this, Captain.
If they even sneeze,
they better have a handkerchief.
Understood.
We need a candidate.
Someone who will
quickly win the delegates' support.
An established name.
I'm not a politician.
But you know
how to get things done.
You've kept this fleet functioning
all this time.
No. Thanks, but...
I can't allow Tom Zarek to be one heartbeat
away from the presidency, Wally.
I need you.
You've got me, Madam President.
How can you reassure people that
you're looking out for their interests...
as opposed to the rehabilitation
of Tom Zarek?
That's a great question, Playa.
This is how I see it.
We're facing a situation so unique,
so specific...
that I believe
we need not only new leadership...
but a whole new way of thinking.
Like blowing up a building or two?
If things weren't so serious,
I'd say that was funny.
Look, there's no economy.
There's no market. No industry.
No capital. Money is worthless.
And yet, we're all held hostage
by the idea of the way things used to be.
Look where we are.
This man wakes up every morning...
tugs on his boots
and goes to work in this garden.
Why?
Because it's his job? What job?
He labours,
but he gets no benefit from his labour.
He's not the only one.
Many of us are just still going
through the motions of our old lives.
The lawyers still act like lawyers,
but they have no clients.
Businessmen still act like
businessmen, but have no business.
President Roslin and her policies
are all about holding on to a fantasy.
If we want to survive,
we need to completely restructure our lives.
We need to think
about the community of citizens.
The group, not the individual.
We need to completely free ourselves
of the past and operate as a collective.
You're not interested in the citizens.
You just want power.
Turn that crap off.
I was listening to that broadcast.
You again?
That's a shame.
They want to hear Mr. Zarek speak, too.
Don't you, buddy?
See? He wants to hear Mr. Zarek.
How about you?
You want to hear what Mr. Zarek has to say?
I don't mind one way or the other.
Well, I take that as a yes. So turn it on.
- Now.
- Leave it.
Mr. Zarek is a representative of the people
and we are the people.
Well, you're people. Sort of.
You know, I don't like your tone,
flyboy...
so why don't you just move along out of here
and go enjoy the imitation weather?
I'd be happy to, after you leave.
Which is now.
Okay.
Don't want no trouble.
What the hell.
There's a gun.
Starbuck.
Incoming.
Are you looking for this?
The Telamon Building's still standing.
That's Delphi, all right.
Now, all we have to do is wait until dark...
infiltrate the most heavily fortified
military hub on this planet...
hope the Cylons haven't
completely wasted the spaceport...
steal a ship, locate Galactica
and fly to her without getting shot to hell.
- Is that all?
- Yeah.
I guess we can relax until dark.
Might as well make ourselves comfortable.
You hungry?
No, not right now.
Your stomach's feeling better?
Starving.
I'm trying to make sense out of
the two women we saw with the Cylons.
And?
I can't fathom why anybody
would wanna help the toasters.
And they just happened to be twins?
That's too weird.
You got a better explanation?
You think the Cylons could be messing
with human DNA?
Cloning people or something?
Could be.
That would explain
how they took us by surprise.
They had these replicated humans
infiltrating the colonies...
laying the groundwork
for the surprise attack.
You know, if they were human clones...
that means they're capable
of complex emotions, maybe even love.
Maybe they were misguided
in the way that they were indoctrinated.
Whatever they are, they're not human.
No human could do the things they've done.
Killed billions of innocent people.
They've got to be fracking Cylons,
just like the rest of them.
Why do you have a summit itinerary?
Why circle every public appearance
by President Roslin?
It's not mine.
Some stranger wandered down the hall,
picked the lock to your room and left this?
False-bottom with anechoic coating
to absorb x-rays.
Ceramic stealth gun.
You sure went through a lot of trouble
to get that weapon onboard.
I carry a lot of money. I need protection.
Right.
The money's worthless.
Your friend Zarek pointed that out.
I don't even know Zarek.
Your pal Grimes says different.
He gave you up.
You're bluffing. You haven't got anything.
We don't need anything, Valance.
Because this isn't a trial.
This is just you and us in this room.
Like Zarek pointed out,
we're living in a whole new world.
No due process.
This is your courtroom.
And that would make us your executioners.
So you might want to cooperate,
or else you're going out an air lock.
Because that's what we do to traitors.
Look, I...
I just came over here
for the booze and the food.
That's it.
You know what? Frack you!
We put all the heat on Valance
we could but can't tie him to Zarek.
I know Zarek's behind this.
Keep working on Valance.
We will. To be safe, I think you should
send the Sagittaron delegation back.
Can't. Violates their civil rights,
plays right into Zarek's hands.
He could have another shooter
on Cloud Nine...
and if Zarek wins the vote,
he's more than capable...
of ordering your assassination
and ascending to the presidency.
Zarek's not going to win
because I'm not going to let him.
Meanwhile, keep Zarek under surveillance,
tap his phones, bug his room.
If you find anything that remotely connects
Zarek to Valance, shut him down.
The domestic policies we've been
talking about over the last little while...
such as employment,
housing and education...
Latest vote count:
seven for Gray, five for Zarek.
We're slipping. He was four an hour ago.
- Zarek must be making promises.
- Picon flipped.
We've got to hold
the colonies till they vote tomorrow.
On Page 33
of my mission statement...
I lay out a 16-point educational programme
that the President and I have developed.
Individuals with four-year college degrees
will be eligible.
Hi. How are you doing? Remember me?
We got Valance. And you're next.
Health care, it's one thing to talk...
Can I get you something?
So you work here now?
Why should I ask the bartender
to get me a drink?
- What's in it for him?
- A big tip.
What would he spend on?
So, are you worried about Wallace Gray?
I hear he's ahead in the vote count.
Whatever the people want is fine by me.
Everyone has an agenda. I know I do.
And what would that be?
The same as yours, Tom. Me. Myself.
And I.
You are clearly a well-connected,
well-informed woman.
Wife of the XO.
For whatever that's worth.
Quite a bit. Now and in the future.
That's what I'm interested in, Tom.
My place...
and my husband's place in the future.
Okay.
I'm looking for a friend of mine.
His name is Valance.
How the hell did this happen?
We've got to get to the President.
We're here with
Dr. Gaius Baltar, representative of Caprica.
Dr. Baltar, I had one question.
Is President Roslin's political career
terminal or is there hope of resuscitating it?
Laura Roslin's political career
is very much alive...
and to underestimate her
would be a very serious mistake.
- You miss the limelight, don't you, Gaius?
- Yes, I have.
- You have what, Dr. Baltar?
- Nothing. You were saying?
You seriously believe
that this school teacher...
is able to handle the job of presidency?
His wrists were slashed
with broken glass from the room.
- So was it suicide or was it murder?
- It was no suicide.
- Zarek had him killed.
- lf only we could prove that.
How'd they get past the Marine Guards?
Through the vent.
I'm glad to hear it...
because all of us have had teachers
who made an impact on our lives.
History is full of examples of leaders...
who have come
from the most humble beginnings...
and have risen to meet the challenge
posed by cataclysmic events.
How many people knew
where Valance was being held?
Just the people in this room
plus two Marines.
... criticise Roslin and the tough
decisions she has to make every day.
Especially, if you're someone
like Tom Zarek...
who's never shouldered
any real responsibility in your life.
To be fair to Tom,
he's been in prison for the last 20 years.
And now that he's had
a drastic personality makeover...
he's posing like
he's the saviour to all your ills.
I think you all have a short memory.
Well, someone talked.
And now we have no assassin,
no evidence of a plot...
no check on Zarek, no nothing.
If he can get to Valance,
he can get to anyone.
Madam President, he will definitely try
and take a shot at you now.
Only if he wins the vote.
What I have to say is, we must survive.
And we will survive.
And we will do so through the values
that have made our colonies great.
Courage. Truth. Justice. Liberty.
With a firm and deep resolve
to make tomorrow better.
Not just for ourselves, but for our children.
Madam President, I still worry
the vote may be trending against you.
Yes, it is.
But I'm going to win this thing.
And Tom Zarek is going back
to his prison ship where he belongs.
But first I have
two very unpleasant duties to perform.
I need a shuttle to Cloud Nine.
What am I supposed to say?
- Health reasons.
- Oh, right, fine. Health reasons.
You know, all those years...
I watched you working with Adar.
You were always so quiet, so polite...
so dignified.
I never thought you'd fit in with
the bare-knuckled, backstabbing politicians.
I guess I was wrong.
All clear.
Dr. Baltar? Are you in here?
Madam President?
I heard you on the wireless.
You were very articulate, quite engaging.
Oh, thank you.
That's very encouraging.
Yeah, I was just trying to do my bit
as the elected representative of Caprica.
Besides, I'm beginning
to get a real feel for politics.
So I take it you're not voting for Mr. Zarek?
A man who uses his intelligence
and resources to blow up buildings...
doesn't get my vote, no.
No, I'm voting for your man Gray.
He's really great.
He is great, which is why he's got my vote.
Unfortunately...
Mr. Gray dropped out of the race.
- Then who do you want me to vote for?
- I was thinking you.
Me?
- Look...
- Doctor, let's cut to the chase.
You're a very popular man
these days.
I would be fortunate to have
your intellect...
and your popularity right by my side.
Under those circumstances, I accept.
Thank you, Madam President.
Thank you.
Wow. What are you going to do now?
Now...
I'm going to give you an exclusive.
After you.
So what are we supposed to do?
Sit on our hands and watch her get killed?
Zarek's too smart to take another shot
at the President during the summit.
If he wins the vote,
he can take her out later...
when everyone's forgotten about Valance.
He'll just bide his time
to find a better opportunity.
That's great.
Anyway, she says
she's not going to lose the vote.
She says a lot of things.
Don't you think you should wash that?
I did.
Like when, a month ago?
- Do you have a problem with my hygiene?
- You have hygiene?
I clean up good sometimes, all right?
Well, let me know
when it's one of those times.
Tauron, Gaius Baltar.
The surprises just keep on coming.
A number of the Quorum delegates
have now shifted their support...
to the scientific genius...
a man who is credited with saving
the fleet on numerous occasions.
At this point, Jim, it is anyone's guess...
as to who's going to win,
but my money is on Gaius. Dr. Baltar.
Aquaria, Thomas Zarek.
Aerilon:
Tom Zarek.
The vote is now six-five
in favour of Tom Zarek.
The next vote
will determine our new vice-president.
If Zarek gets it, he wins.
In the event of a tie,
the President will cast the deciding vote.
Citizens...
I give you your new vice-president,
Dr. Gaius Baltar.
The perks of power, Mr. Vice-President.
We're going to do great things together.
Good. It's difficult to fathom.
I never aspired to power.
Of course you didn't, Gaius.
But someone had to step up.
- Well, after what Laura told me...
- Laura?
Yeah, we're on
a first name basis now.
Now look, I think the people need me.
Excuse us.
So...
that bum knee of yours
is looking pretty good.
And the other one's not too bad either.
Lee, if you want to ask me to dance,
just ask.
You want to dance?
Me in a dress
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
- Madam President.
- Mr. Zarek.
Oh, don't worry,
I won't be kissing you today.
That's a shame.
I shaved very closely in anticipation
of being smacked by you.
That was very nicely played.
Again.
But there's still a presidential election
in six months.
- I'll see you then.
- I have no doubt.
Oh, one thing you should know.
I didn't kill Valance.
I wonder who did?
Madam President, good evening.
I thought you hated these things.
It's Colonial Day.
Where else would I be? I'm a patriot.
You really are, aren't you?
Dr. Baltar. Interesting choice.
I figured, the devil you know.
Politics. As exciting as war.
Definitely as dangerous.
Though in war you only get killed once.
In politics, it can happen over and over.
You're still standing.
So are you.
And I can dance.
- I have a surprise for you.
- Should I be worried?
Not unless you consider a day...
in a luxury suite aboard the Rising Star
as something to be worried about.
What? How did you swing that?
I have my ways.
What you need to do...
is figure out a way to get slave-driving Bill
to give you the day off.
Yeah.
And while we're there, we might want
to talk to a few people...
- about your future.
- What?
Later, my love. It can all wait until later.
Any second now.
If we get caught... If anything happens...
You don't have to say anything. I know.
We're going to make it, Sharon. Okay?
Okay. Go.
Sharon?
We're still alive. Why nobody else?
You never get tired.
Trust me.
Helo, come with me. Helo.
Helo.
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.
Like my new toy?
It's my very own Cylon Raider.
Boy, when you take a souvenir,
you don't screw around.
Congratulations, Doctor.
You've just uncovered your very first Cylon.
She probably doesn't know.
If something happened to you...
I wouldn't know how to deal with it.
I feel the same way.
I'm a Cylon.
Helo, come with me. Helo.
Helo, come with me!
New piece of equipment
that just appeared in CIC.
He had this when we found him.
Send it to Galactica. The lab can look at it.
It's a Cylon device.
I'll continue to take the Chamalla.
It has other benefits.
The hallucinations?
You're going to find Kobol.
Birthplace of us all.
He says we're gonna find Kobol,
and that it's gonna lead us to Earth.
You all right?
You all right?
Stop! Don't come any closer.
Just do it.
Oh, Lee!
Oh, God.
Attention.
Pass the word for Lt. Valerii.
Lt. Valerii, report to the Ready Room
for a pre-flight briefing.
You don't lose control.
Thanks.
No.
You got to lose control.
Let your instincts take over.
I thought we were just sparring.
That's why you don't win.
The doctor said I have six months
at the outside.
He said the cancer's moved
into my lymphatic system.
Aggressively moved in.
I want you to hear me on this.
You made a true believer out of me.
Strange as that sounds, considering.
But I believe.
I know you're the one to lead us
to our salvation.
You are going to guide us to Earth.
Then we better find it soon.
- I'm out.
- Like it's yours.
- I picked up your five.
- Frankly, I don't care.
No, thank you, Doctor, I have a watch later.
Crashdown hits. Davis?
What?
A little bit of this.
A little bit of that.
You guys always play this slow?
What did you say?
Don't distract me.
Uncanny, I know.
All right, 20, I call.
And I raise you another 30.
You can't compete with me.
I always win.
I'm sorry.
Never seen you like this, Gaius.
It's disappointing somehow.
Common.
So sorry to disappoint you.
Disappoint you all.
Thirty.
And I call it.
What do you got, buddy?
- Absolutely nothing.
- Not bad, Crash.
But not compared to that.
Oh!
You are...
No!
You win every time.
Sorry, I have to do it.
Very sorry to disappoint you.
There's a card game...
Hey.
She's back on her feet, ladies and gentlemen.
- How are you feeling?
- Hey, Gaius.
Good.
Mr. Vice President,
if you don't mind, Lt. Thrace.
Some level of decorum must be maintained,
or is it a pirate ship you're running?
No. Just a Battlestar, sir.
All right, let's play.
Would you like to play?
Maybe you'd like to sit next to Capt. Adama?
Sure, Kara. Why don't you pull up a pew?
No, that's okay, Lee. I've got things to do.
Nothing's wild. Here we go.
All right, currency.
While bartering will continue
for the foreseeable future...
we do have a system in place now
to take the economy back...
to a currency-based standard.
Do you love her?
Did you...
Dr. Baltar...
if something should happen to me,
it is vital that you comprehend...
and are familiar with the political structures
beginning to fall into place here.
- Do you understand this?
- Answer me.
Yes, of course I understand.
My answer is no.
No, I don't think I can handle this right now.
The intricacies of the bureaucracy,
I can't get my head around.
This which,
with all due respect, Madam President...
you have spent your entire political career
learning to understand.
More to the point...
how you could think that
my head could be turned so quickly...
by a new thing...
it just astounds me.
How did you seriously think I could
cope with this kind of responsibility?
I don't believe you.
You're a genius, are you not?
Well, quite frankly,
I don't give a flying frack...
whether you believe me or not. All right?
Because I've had it.
I am tired of being pushed and
prodded around like I'm some kind of toy.
- I'm not your plaything.
- Plaything?
I don't work for you!
And quite frankly,
I don't have to sit here anymore...
and take this kind of abuse
from either of you!
You either!
Either in here, either in there.
Wherever it is, I don't need to take it.
- I love you, Gaius.
- Do me a favour.
Yeah?
I think perhaps you need a break from this.
You're right.
We need a break.
I'd like to be alone if you don't mind.
How can you love her, Gaius?
I don't.
You can't lie to me,
I know everything you know.
That's lovely.
Thank you.
Did you...
Did you want
something in particular this time?
I thought you should know...
that it's not safe to remain on Galactica.
What are you talking about?
It's a surprise.
Tell me, what is it? What is it?
Is it a bomb? Another Cylon bomb, right?
Is it an agent?
Is a Cylon agent about to be activated?
Tell me!
Galactica, this is Raptor 1
preparing to jump to Sector 728.
Let's hope we find some supplies out there.
Roger that. Good hunting out there.
Crash, counter our spinner?
Fuel drive's spun up and ready.
Jump in five, four, three, two, one.
Whoa, baby!
Frack me!
Gaeta, the fracking idiot.
You can't plan a jump that close to a planet.
What if we jumped into it?
It was great. It's fine. We made it. We're cool.
Are you seeing this?
Yeah.
Oceans.
Continents.
No. Let me at this thing.
Okay. Atmosphere reads as:
Nitrogen, oxygen. Looks like enough CO2
for green leafy things.
I'm getting excited here, Boomer.
Boomer, this could be it.
This could be the big one. This is the little
planet that solves all our problems.
Boomer?
Do you think this is Earth?
No. It's not Earth.
It's more important than that.
Doesn't really work as well as before, huh?
You know, I do get cold.
There's some things you should know, Helo.
Don't call me that.
You're not even Sharon.
You're not even human.
So don't act like you know me...
because you don't!
But I am Sharon! And that's part
of what you need to understand!
Sharon was a friend of mine!
Whatever twisted thing you are,
you are not Sharon! You got that?
The only thing I want from you
is a way off this fracked up world. That's it!
Going hunting?
I'm adding a gunnery run
to the jump test tomorrow.
See if our boy
can shoot anything with our ammo.
So it's a boy now?
I changed my mind.
You ever wonder why
everyone calls it a she, but to you, it's a he?
It's fascinating, Lee.
You should write a paper.
It's not really my scene.
I'm not as smart as, say, Dr. Baltar.
How is the Vice President,
by the way?
I don't know. Haven't seen him.
So he's a "love them and leave them"
kind of guy, I guess.
I guess.
Ships just pass in the night.
Yup.
Didn't mean a thing.
Nope.
Just bored. Looking for something to do.
So fracking the Vice President
seemed like a great way to waste some time.
- You want something from me?
- Not a thing.
- I don't owe you anything.
- You don't owe me anything.
Because I'm just a CAG,
and you're just a pilot.
- Right.
- A pilot that can't keep her pants on!
Right.
It's just like old times, Kara.
Like when you got drunk and couldn't keep
your hands off the major from wherever...
God!
Why did you do it, Kara? Just tell me why.
Because I'm a screw-up, Lee.
Try and keep that in mind.
Commander Adama is
sending out another Raptor...
to conduct an aerial survey of this planet.
It appears to have suffered
some sort of calamity...
but it could actually be inhabitable.
Aerial survey shows evidence
of at least one city on the surface.
It was obviously abandoned
long ago.
How old are the ruins?
We won't know for sure
until we send a ground team...
but the initial estimates have it...
on the order of approximately 2,000 years.
That's around the time
the 13 Tribes first left Kobol.
Let me see.
Ruins? What ruins?
This is an inhabited city.
Look at the buildings.
Buildings?
Look.
What did you see? Tell me, Laura.
A dome-like structure with six roads
leading out of it like spokes.
With something around it like columns, like
a forum, like the forum on Caprica, actually.
The forum in the opera house
in the city of the gods on Kobol.
This planet is Kobol.
Kobol like Kobol?
The birthplace of mankind.
Where the gods and man lived in paradise.
Until the exodus of the 13 Tribes.
Madam President, what's going on?
It's real. The scriptures, the myths,
the prophecies. They're all real.
So say we all.
Hello, Lieutenant.
Hey, Doc.
This is a bad time, right?
No. I'm just cleaning my gun.
What's going on?
I was going to ask you the same question.
Actually, I was looking
for Lt. Thrace.
But sometimes,
it's good to talk these things over.
Deep down, she knows she's a Cylon.
But her conscious mind won't accept it.
Sometimes I have these dark thoughts.
- What kind of dark thoughts?
- Her model is weak.
Always has been.
But in the end, she'll carry out her mission.
I don't know.
But I'm afraid I'm going to hurt someone.
I feel like I have to be stopped.
She can't be stopped. She's a Cylon.
You can't help her, Gaius.
But you could probably sleep with her.
That's what you want, right?
I'm not sure why...
Sometimes...
we must embrace that which opens up for us.
Embrace?
Life can be a curse...
as well as a blessing.
You will believe me when I tell you...
there are far worse things than death
in this world.
So you're saying...
No.
What I say is meaningless.
Listen to your heart.
Embrace that which you know
to be the right decision.
You might be right. This may be Kobol.
We should seriously consider
permanent settlement on this planet.
The scriptures tell us that
Kobol points the way to Earth.
Organise a ground survey team.
Three Raptors.
I want a complete survey
of the ruins immediately.
Yes, sir.
You should go.
Remember what I said, Gaius?
You don't want to be here when it happens.
When what happens?
What would happen if I go?
In fact, I think I'm going to volunteer
for the survey party.
Your presence won't be necessary, Doctor.
Thank you.
I'm the Vice President of the colony,
selected in my own right.
And I feel that my presence on the planet
will be necessary, Commander.
As your chief science advisor,
I have to analyse the samples...
the team brings,
and it would be more efficient...
if I can gather the samples by myself.
Unless you have any objection,
Madam President.
No objections. Thank you.
We need to talk.
Sure.
You okay?
What do you think?
I think it's hard to imagine
that you forgot to check the chamber.
I didn't forget.
Sharon, what's going on?
I know things
haven't been so great lately, but...
I wake up in the morning...
and I wonder who I am.
I wake up and wonder
if I'm going to hurt someone.
Sharon, you need help.
Not from you.
You made that clear.
I'm on my own.
No, you're not.
Thanks for coming out, Chief.
You're dismissed.
So according to the scriptures...
if we had the arrow of Apollo, we could
take it down to Kobol, and we could use it...
to open the tomb of Athena
and find our way to Earth.
I didn't know you were that religious.
Neither did I.
Something wrong with that?
No.
It's just new.
There is no Earth. You understand that.
It would seem that we were wrong.
Commander, just because you and I
don't know where it is...
it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
Madam President...
I am not trying to mock your faith,
so please understand me.
These stories about Kobol, gods...
the arrow of Apollo...
they're just stories, legends, myths.
Don't let it blind you
to the reality that we face.
Reality is that the Cylon Raider
has been successfully jump-tested.
Reality is that Cylon technology
obviously outstrips our own.
And reality is there is a good chance...
the Raider can jump all the way back
to Caprica and retrieve that arrow...
and find our way to Earth.
The real Earth.
The Raider's a military asset.
I won't use it to go chasing
some mythical arrow.
I'm sorry.
I say we find Kobol,
count our blessings, and just stay there.
But the sacred scrolls say
that this could guide us to Earth. Right?
Okay. Cut the chatter. Raptors 2 and 3 on me.
FTL's spun up and ready?
Cally, hold onto your lunch.
Jump in ten...
nine, eight...
seven, six, five...
four, three...
two, one.
Jump complete, gentlemen.
Bring the nose down,
we should see the planet directly ahead.
What the hell is that?
Oh, my God!
Cartman! Get us out of here!
We got a fire in the turbine.
Shutting it down!
Put it down!
Out of the way! Come on!
Get out of the seat, Doc!
Everybody hang on!
Can you jump us out?
No, the out drive's been hit.
Socinus, get on the horn...
and tell Raptor 2 to jump back to Galactica!
Right now!
Jump back to Galactica!
Jump back to Galactica, over.
You are ordered to jump back to Galactica.
Whenever they're within
proximity of one another...
they send off a short IFF burst.
Essentially, they are Cylon transponders...
programmed to identify themselves
to any other Cylon transponder.
- Damn nice work, Lieutenant.
- That's very good.
Now that we know what they are,
I want to test one in the Raider.
Draidus contact.
Raptor 275, sir.
Back early.
Something's wrong.
What the hell are you doing?
Oh, God!
Hang on!
God! Oh, my God!
Do it!
Everybody hit the deck!
I can't see!
Pull it up!
Watch the hill!
Thanks for watching!
How many people did we lose?
Ten souls aboard Raptor 3.
Raptor 1, last visual contact was seen...
under power flight
heading toward the surface.
We need a way to take out the base ship
before we can attempt a rescue.
Starbuck's working on a plan...
using the captured Raider
to get a nuke into the base ship.
- The Raider?
- When did this happen?
About 19 minutes ago.
She said she's working on the details
and we'll have a report at 1400.
Go talk to Starbuck right away.
My pleasure.
And report back to me.
Yes, sir.
Is there something to worry about,
Madam President?
Why do you ask that?
- That look on your face.
- Not now.
Take that out.
The Chief said we need it, but I don't.
Lt. Thrace, attention!
I gave you a command.
You will obey it. Attention!
You do not take
your harebrained ideas to the XO...
without going through me first.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
At ease. So what's the plan?
I'm putting an autopilot in the Raider.
Jump him to the base ship.
Engage the autopilot, punch out.
Get picked up by a Raptor.
The Raider heads
to the base ship.
Except the transponder
allows the Raider to approach.
Nuke goes off.
Boom, sir.
Might work. Might get you killed.
Would you miss me, sir?
I need every pilot I have.
Even the screw-ups.
Captain.
I'm really sorry.
If you do this, it could threaten
everything we've accomplished.
It may bring down the government
and you don't have a right...
to risk that for a...
Go on.
For a drug-induced vision of prophecy.
I am well aware of that.
But it would seem that
the gods have a different plan.
Would you please get me
Lt. Thrace?
Can I get you some more water?
Yes. Thanks.
You can't be serious.
All of this has happened before
and will happen again.
That Cylon you interrogated,
he quoted that bit of scripture.
He also said that we would find Kobol...
and Kobol would show us the way,
did he not?
Yes, he did.
We have found Kobol.
Do you believe in the gods, Lieutenant?
Not that it's any of your business,
but, yes, I believe.
Lieutenant, I am not trying to put you
on the defensive...
I would like you
to think this through with me.
If you believe in the gods...
then you believe in the cycle of time...
that we are all playing our parts in a story...
that is told again and again
and again throughout eternity.
That's the way I was raised.
But that doesn't mean
that my part in the story...
is to go off on some crazy-ass mission
against orders.
May I tell you the part of the story
that it would seem I am playing?
I am dying.
- What?
- I have terminal breast cancer.
I have six months at the outside to live,
and I have only told three people...
so I'd appreciate it if you kept it to yourself.
Of course.
Are you saying that you are...
The scripture tells us a dying leader...
lead humanity to the promised land.
If you go back to Caprica
and bring me the arrow...
I will show us the way.
This is crazy.
People keep using that word.
It is crazy. Perhaps.
That doesn't mean it isn't true.
And it may be our only chance.
Our only chance...
to find Earth.
The old man is our last chance to find Earth.
He knows where it is. He said so.
You were there.
The location is a secret.
But he is going to take us there.
Commander Adama has no idea...
where Earth is. He never did.
He made it up in order to give people hope.
- You're lying.
- Go ask him.
I will.
I need one more in-flight test...
for the autopilot and NAV systems
before I jump for Kobol.
Right.
Can I ask you a question, boss?
Shoot.
How much longer till we reach Earth?
It's hard to say.
You got a guess?
You know I don't like to guess.
Are we getting closer?
I'm sure we are.
Good luck on the next test.
Apollo. Starbuck. I'm ready over here.
Okay, Starbuck. The board is green.
Copy that.
Powering up for the autopilot test.
This is Starbuck, request permission
to speak with Galactica actual.
Starbuck wants to speak to you, sir.
She's on a scrambled channel.
Go ahead.
I believed you. Believed in Earth.
What are you doing, Starbuck?
Bringing home the CAG, sir.
We can talk about this.
No, I don't think so.
I want you to remember one thing.
I do not regret anything that I did.
Be sure that whatever you're going to do,
you don't regret it later.
Do you understand me?
I guess we'll find out.
Commander, she's spinning up
the Raider's FTL drive.
What?
This is an autopilot test,
what the hell is she doing?
What are you doing, Kara?
Galactica. Apollo. She just jumped away.
Repeat. Starbuck and the Raider
just jumped away.
She wasn't scheduled for a jump test.
Where the hell did she go?
Home.
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.
Just do it.
Boomer, this could be it.
This is the little planet
that solves all of our problems.
What did you see?
A dome-like structure with six roads
leading out of it.
This planet is Kobol.
Organise a ground survey team.
Three Raptors.
- They're everywhere!
- We're not getting out of here!
We need a way to take out the base ship
before we can attempt a rescue.
If you go back to Caprica
and bring me the arrow...
I will show us the way.
What are you doing, Starbuck?
Galactica. Apollo. She just jumped away.
- Where the hell did she go?
- Home.
This is it! Now, come on!
Now come on! Everybody up!
Come on! Go!
Come on, move! Out!
Come on, get him out of the chair.
Look at me.
I got him!
For gods' sakes, hurry!
Come on!
I got his legs.
I got him!
Put him on your shoulder.
Doc! Come on, Doc!
Crash!
Doc!
Take my hand.
Gaius, take my hand.
Hey, come on!
Wake up! Stay with me! We gotta go!
Stay with me, Doc! Come on!
Come on! Bring him outside!
It's gonna blow!
Get down!
Stay down.
How's he? You okay?
We got full tanks. Let's see what we get.
Getting them down.
You all right? You okay?
Get the supplies
before they burn. Go.
Right away.
We crashed both tanks.
The gas is gone. It's all gone.
It's a museum. So what?
It's more than that.
It's the home of the arrow of Apollo.
What the hell is that?
You never liked history.
Come on, Helo. It's supposed to be
the only clue as to the location of Earth.
Earth? What are you talking about?
Who's going to Earth? It doesn't even exist.
I'm trying to get back to Galactica.
What I need from you is a way off this planet,
and a way back to my ship.
If you don't do that, I'll blow your head off.
Why don't you just shut up for a change?
You're only alive because I've kept you alive.
If it wasn't for me, you'd be dead by now.
So whether you like it or not,
I'm your only hope of getting off this planet.
So if I were you, I'd take that tough guy
attitude of yours and shove it up your ass.
We can't move around the city
during daylight.
So we hole up and we wait till dark.
Unbelievable.
She's crossed the line before,
but this is so far beyond the pale...
She wouldn't have done this on her own.
She was coerced.
No one coerces Starbuck.
Believe me, I've tried.
Commander, I have the President on the line.
Bear witness. Put on your headset.
Madam President, moments ago,
Lt. Thrace took the Cylon Raider...
- on an unscheduled and unauthorised jump.
- Yes.
Do you have any knowledge of this incident?
Let's save some time here, Commander.
The question you really want to ask me...
is whether or not I asked Lt. Thrace
to take the Raider to Caprica.
The answer to your question is yes.
- You and I had talked about this.
- Yes, we had.
We both decided
it was a military decision.
My responsibility as President
is first and foremost...
to protect and preserve
this fleet and its future.
In the end, that outweighs
any other consideration. It has to.
By taking the Raider...
you've placed our people
on the surface of Kobol in direct danger.
I'm very aware of the danger
our men and women are in on Kobol.
I am also deeply aware of the danger
this civilisation will be in...
if I ignore the pursuit of this arrow.
I'm going to have to ask you
for your resignation, Madam President.
No.
Then I'm terminating your presidency
as of this moment.
Commander Adama,
I will exercise the authority of this office...
until I am unable to do so.
So if you want to stage a coup...
you're gonna have to come over here
and arrest me.
- I don't want any bloodshed.
- Of course you don't. Neither do I.
Neither does the press.
They're here, by the way.
The press.
They're recording every minute.
- What is it, Captain?
- Isolate Colonial One.
Mr. Gaeta.
Jam any transmissions
in or out of Colonial One immediately.
- Yes, sir.
- Prepare a strike team.
As long as she's President, she's dangerous.
If she can turn Starbuck against us,
she's capable of anything.
Yes, sir.
- She's bluffing.
- Well, let's hope so.
There's also a Cylon base ship out there
to deal with.
Leave that to me.
This government survived a Cylon attack.
It will survive William Adama.
I think he's bluffing.
But just in case, we need to be prepared.
I know their security detail.
They will defend that ship.
We'll have to take her down
compartment by compartment.
Mr. Gaeta?
Sir.
Am I correct in assuming
that I have two Cylon transponders left?
Yes, sir. But only one of them
is fully functional.
One will do.
Now I need a pilot.
Sir.
As you were.
- How are you feeling?
- It looks worse than it is, sir.
Things are moving very quickly
and I need every pilot.
I'm ready, sir.
I have a very special mission for you
and I won't kid around.
- It's high risk, extremely high risk.
- I understand.
I need you to light-jump to Kobol
and take care of this base star.
We're placing a Cylon transponder
aboard your Raptor.
In theory, it should allow you to approach
the base star without getting fired upon.
But we'll still be ID'd as Colonial Raptors
once we're in visual range.
For all they know,
you could be two Cylon agents...
returning with a captured Raptor.
Once you're inside
the defence perimeter...
I need you to make them think
you want to dock.
You have to fire your nuke
into the loading bay...
and then jump back home immediately.
Do you understand?
I understand.
I can do it, sir. I know I can.
You have to.
Yes, sir.
This doesn't look good.
Please tell me this was not all for nothing.
I'm good.
I am really good.
I'm home.
Wow, I'm home.
Gaeta, please tell me that you're right
about this transponder thing.
Stop. Stop that.
I'm nervous.
Like anything scares you.
Things scare me, Helo. I have feelings.
You have software.
I don't know
if you can hear this or not, Helo...
but what we had between us was important.
It was very important.
- Why?
- Because it was the next step.
Because it brings us closer to God.
Don't mock the gods. It's a human belief.
I'm human. They're our gods.
But beyond that, I just want you to know
that I genuinely feel something for you.
I don't care.
I don't love you.
I loved what I thought was you.
Helo, I think there's something
else that you should know.
I'm pregnant.
Galactica, Apollo.
We have visual on Colonial One.
Tell Apollo he's cleared
to begin the assault...
to contact us when he has soft-seal
on the hull.
Aye, sir.
Commander, Boomer and Racetrack
are in the air, ready for their jump to Kobol.
Put them through down here.
Boomer, Galactica Actual.
I just wanted to say good luck,
good hunting...
and I have complete faith in the both of you.
Thank you, Actual. We won't let you down.
Racetrack, start the jump clock.
Clock is running.
Galactica. Apollo.
We have soft-seal.
I know Commander Adama
and I'm counting on the fact...
that when push comes to shove,
he is the kind of man...
who will not want bloodshed.
Nevertheless, this may not be
the safest place.
Billy, how many civilians
are in the cargo hold?
176.
There is room in the cargo hold
and I implore you to find refuge there...
with the other civilians. This is my choice.
This is my choice.
- You do not have to come with me.
- We stand with our president.
Yes?
Right.
Security commander reports sounds
of someone cutting through the hull.
The Raptors are cutting through the hull, sir.
Get the President on the line.
You think this thing is working?
We're about to find out.
- I guess so.
- Yeah.
- How are we doing on that?
- It's not responding, sir.
Are you even trained to use this thing?
How's he doing, Chief?
Not doing so good. I don't now
if his lungs are burned or what.
Well, he's a tough kid.
He's gonna pull through.
Get those wounds looked at, Chief.
Yeah. Lieutenant?
Shouldn't we be moving out?
- Do you have a plan for tactical deployment?
- Plan for tactical deployment, Chief?
Get to the high ground. It'll be our best
chance of being seen by a search party.
High ground is also our best chance
of being seen by the Cylons.
They're flying around, sir.
They might land the troops...
before we get rescued.
That's true.
Yeah.
Sir, if I may...
suggest that we take cover on the ground...
maybe somewhere
we won't be seen from the air?
Okay, yeah. Chief, that's...
Carry on, Chief.
Launch the nuke and prepare to jump.
Frack.
What?
The bomb release is jammed. I can't free it.
We can dock inside the ship.
- Excuse me?
- They think we're Cylons. They'll let us dock.
We can release the bomb manually
and drop the nuke inside the ship itself.
- It'll work. I know it.
- Oh, my gods.
Petard, Felix?
Wanna give me a hand here, please?
Yes, sir.
Cally, how's he doing?
Not good, sir.
Get a blanket on him.
Keep him warm.
How are you?
Alive.
You saved me.
You saved my life.
- Care to return the favour?
- Are you in need of saving?
You wondered why you were chosen?
Why God chose you above all other humans
to survive and serve His purpose?
Now is the time to find out why.
Lords of Kobol, hear our prayer.
Bring us out of the darkness
and into the light.
Give us the strength to show mercy
to those who are merciless...
The President says she will not yield.
...hearts that they may find peace...
The President says she will not yield.
So be it.
Come on, D,
tell me he's not actually gonna do this.
Tell me she's not gonna
make him do it.
Redeem our hearts that they may find peace
in the midst of war.
What's going on?
They're in.
Quickly.
Billy?
Billy?
Sir, they're in.
Pretty, isn't it?
Hello, Lieutenant.
Something I can help you with?
I'm setting her down.
Open the hatch.
I'll release the bomb.
Keep the engines ready for takeoff
the second I get back.
- Yes, sir.
- Close the hatch after me.
- lf I'm not back in five minutes, just go.
- You got it.
Oh, my God.
Welcome back to Caprica, Lieutenant.
Like what we've done with the place?
Sharon.
What the frack are you doing?
Where are you going?
Son of a bitch.
Okay, okay.
Sharon.
This isn't happening.
Come on, Starbuck.
Got anything left?
Starbuck?
Madam President,
no one needs to get hurt here.
Then why don't you get off my ship,
Colonel?
I'm placing you under arrest.
- No. We're not doing this.
- I'm in command here, Captain.
- Colonel, this is wrong.
- You're relieved. Fall back.
Madam President, I wish to...
Men, lay down your weapons.
Have you lost your fracking mind?
Colonel, tell these Marines to fall back.
This is mutiny. You know that.
Yes, I do.
But you can tell my father
I'm listening to my instincts.
And my instincts tell me
we cannot sacrifice our democracy...
just because the President
makes a bad decision.
Put your guns down.
- Madam President, stand back.
- Put your gun down, Captain.
I will not have bloodshed,
neither your men nor my people...
on the Colonial One.
Put your gun down. All of you.
Please, put your gun down.
Let's go.
Let's go, Captain.
Let's go.
You're confused. And scared.
But it's okay.
I'm not a Cylon.
I'm Sharon Valerii. I was born on Troy.
My parents were
Katherine and Abraham Valerii.
You can't fight destiny, Sharon.
It catches up with you.
No matter what you do.
Don't worry about us.
We'll see you again.
- We love you, Sharon.
- And we always will.
Boomer!
Come on, let's go!
What took you so long?
Go!
Where's your helmet?
Go back. Don't turn around.
He put his weapon right to my head.
Said to tell you
he was following his instincts...
whatever the hell that means.
Bring him here.
What about Roslin?
We put her in the brig.
Dradis contacts!
It's Boomer and Racetrack, sir.
Put them on the speakers.
Galactica,
Boomer. Mission accomplished.
Repeat: Mission accomplished.
The base star is history!
There's some good news.
Bring them home, D.
It's good to hear your voice, Boomer.
Come on home.
It's okay.
I can't believe it.
You are like the last person
I expected to see.
I could say the same thing about you.
- You okay?
- Yeah, thank you.
I missed you.
Hey, I...
She's a Cylon!
No!
You can't! She's pregnant.
No!
- I know this place.
- Of course you do.
Go inside.
I don't understand.
Life has a melody, Gaius.
A rhythm of notes
that become your existence...
once they're played in harmony
with God's plan.
It's time to do your part
and realise your destiny.
Which is what, exactly?
You are the guardian and protector
of the new generation of God's children.
The first member of our family
will be with us soon, Gaius.
It's time to make your choice.
But I don't understand
what you're talking about.
I don't understand.
Come. See the face
of the shape of things to come.
Isn't she beautiful, Gaius?
Open the cell.
Close the cell.
Well done, Lieutenant.
Thanks.
Hey, nice work.
Thanks. What's going on?
A lot happened
while you were gone.
Congrats.
Thanks.
Congratulations to both of you.
You carried out a very difficult
and dangerous mission...
and you did it...
despite any personal misgivings
you may or may not have had.
And for that, I'm very proud.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
Someone get a doctor!
Hold his head.
<i>Previously on</i> Battlestar Galactica...
I think the nova does look
like the mandala inside this temple.
Maybe it was a road sign
on the path to Earth.
It was on the temple.
Where'd you get the idea to paint yours?
It was just something I've been doodling
since I was a kid, I liked the pattern.
<i>Starbuck, you're getting too low.</i>
Come on, Lee. Get her out of there.
- You come back!
- Just let me go.
<i>They're waiting for me.</i>
No!
Gaius Baltar,
after carefully weighing the evidence,
this tribunal finds you not guilty.
Get him back! Get him out of here!
Gaius, it's okay. Come with me.
- Where are you taking me to?
- To your new life. Come.
We're going to the Ionian Nebula.
Sitrep!
Sensors show major power fluctuations.
Checking on fleet.
It's true.
We're Cylons.
And we have been from the start.
Dradis contact!
Massive Cylon fleet on intercept course.
I want emergency jump, the entire fleet.
Sir, all fleet ships were powered down
during the outage.
It'll take at least 20 min
to spool up the FTL drives.
We just don't have 20 minutes.
Action stations.
Set condition 1 throughout the ship.
<i>This is not a drill. All Viper pilots
report to Vipers immediately.</i>
I have a bogey at my ten.
I'm gonna go check it out.
What the frak?!
- Hi, Lee.
- Kara?
I've been to Earth.
I know where it is.
And I'm gonna take us there.
No, this is frakkin' crazy.
I saw your ship blow up.
Afraid not.
Did you not hear me?
I've been to Earth.
Earth.
<i>Big blue oceans, fluffy white clouds.</i>
<i>You're gonna love it. I promise.</i>
Identify that ship immediately.
Sir, I'm checking
for colonial recognition codes.
- Get Lee online!
- I'm trying, sir.
- I'm picking up her ship's signature.
- That's her voice.
Hold on. It is not real.
It is a trick.
- Duplicate verification.
- Checking.
- Hostiles inbound! 200 plus!
- CAG, take 'em out!
All players, Galactica.
Threat B-R-3-5-0 carom 2-1-1.
<i>Raptors, lean back as missile pickets.
Weapons free.</i>
Don't lose me this time, Apollo.
Not a chance.
Splash one!
<i>Take that, you frakkin' toasters!</i>
Admiral, it's a Cylon trick.
The Vipers have stopped
the main Cylon thrust,
but the reserves have broken through.
I want everything
that can fly up there immediately.
Saul.
Saul!
What the hell is wrong with you?
Nothing, Bill.
Never felt better in my life.
Colonel Tigh!
I gave you an order.
Everybody that's ever held a stick,
I want them up there now.
Get 'em out!
- Put 'em up there!
- Sir.
Attention. This is the XO.
Let's go! Get that bird in the tube.
Get that Showboat bird in the tube.
Where the frak are these nuggets?
Mama's not gonna save you today!
Let's go!
You want to fly or not?
Ready or not, let's go.
Hey, this is crazy.
What if another switch flips in my head
and turns me against my own?
Shut the frak up.
It's like the colonel said, okay?
Just think of that.
Be the man you want to be
till the day you die.
Easier said than done, I don't know
what the frak I am right now.
You're Samuel T. Anders.
That's all you gotta remember.
- Now get the frak in your ship.
- Who else would he be?
Hey, rook.
Stay cool out there, all right?
You'll lock in
and do what you've been trained to do.
It's just like suiting up
for a championship game, right?
Yeah, that's right. Good hunting.
If she didn't notice anything,
maybe the other Cylons won't either.
Yeah, well, don't wait to find out.
Shoot first.
Get the frak in there.
Go kill something.
Let's go! Let's load these birds!
Anders, get the frak in your Viper!
Where are you taking me?
It's a place we found.
An unused compartment.
- Sir, we've lost Pyxis!
- Oh, my Gods.
Captain Tarney.
600 souls on that ship.
How did they find us?
That's the question, isn't it?
Base ships launching missiles.
40... correction, 50 plus inbound.
Half targeted on us, half on the fleet.
Have triple-a target
only missiles going towards the fleet.
- We can handle the hits. They can't.
- Sir.
All forces, priority intercept enemy
missiles targeting civilian vessels.
I am Samuel T. Anders.
I was born on Picon.
I went to Noyce elementary school.
Get your thumb off the transmit button.
- <i>You're blocking the freq.</i>
- Copy that.
Frak me.
<i>Longshot, Hardball.</i>
Turkey, right four low at three,
committing.
<i>Longshot, I got the...</i>
Tally, I got your back.
Seelix, there's a Raider on you!
- <i>Shoot, Anders!</i>
- I'm trying to.
Gods, come on!
Sir, the Cylon strike force
has just turned back to their ships.
Base ships are spinning up.
They're pulling out.
We're gonna do the same damn thing
before they change their mind.
- Have fighters cover our withdrawal.
- Yes, sir.
All fighters assume
rear cover formation.
They had us.
Game over.
Why the hell did they let us go?
Maybe something's changed.
Like what?
I have no idea, Madame President.
No idea.

You'll be safe here, Gaius.
Right.
Chief, I'm gonna need you to develop
my gun camera footage ASAP.
I've got a hell of a set
of vacation pictures.
I'll take my post-flight checklist.
I want to sign out
so I can get in the showers.
I don't have one for you.
What's up?
Okay.
Okay, me too. It's okay, it's okay.
Do you believe in miracles?
No.
I told everyone that you were
too frakkin' mean to kill.
Okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.
I'm okay.
What the hell are you doing
in a jock smock?
I just finished Viper transition
a week ago,
and I started ACM.
How the...
Starbuck!
I did it, boss.
I found Earth.
Everybody move back.
Hit their post.
Move in.
Step away!
I need you in sickbay.
Cottle's gonna give you
a complete physical examination.
What's going on?
I'm off the ship for a few hours and...
A few hours?
Kara, you were gone for over two months.
That's impossible.
My ship's clock reads
six hours and change.
Then your clock's wrong, Kara.
Sam's telling you the truth.
We thought you were dead.
What?
Gaius, I just wanted you to know
that we'll be back soon.
Whatever you do, please don't go
anywhere by yourself. It's not safe.
Tracey's here for anything you need.
We'll be back as soon as
we've looked in on Derek. Okay?
Right... oh, Derek.
That's your little boy, isn't it?
- The one in sickbay.
- Right.
Yes, I...
I'm praying for his recovery.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank you.
- It's a pleasure.
Thank you.
So what's the game plan, ladies?
Game plan?
Well, this place is brilliant, really.
You know, it's beautiful.
Just when am I getting out of here?
When I am getting off the ship?
Well, security's too tight. Besides...
Besides what? You're just trying
to keep me here and...
None of the other ships will have you.
We'll be back.
Yesterday, you were facing execution.
Today you're free. Why the long face?
Oh, gee, I don't know.
From president of the colonies to this.
King of fools.
Probably best to be hated by everyone
than loved by this lot.
Doomed to live out the rest of my life
in this loony bin.
I don't know, that might have
something to do with my...
rather savage mood swings.
Relax, Gaius.
You think I've brought you this far
just to let it end here?
I need some encouragement.
A ray of hope about the future.
An inkling...
You've got me.
I'm here for you.
That is so beautiful.
Hello. Sorry, what?
The way you were praying.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, thank you, yeah.
Not some hollow ritual.
No,
no.
It's as if the Gods are right here
beside you.
Well, yeah.
When I pray to the Gods,
I feel...
empty.
Do you? That's a shame, isn't it?
Her gods are false.
Tell her.
Well, if you feel empty when you pray
to Zeus or Poseidon or Aphrodite,
it's because it is empty.
It's a totally empty experience.
They're...
They're not real.
They've been promulgated by...
a ruling elite...
To stop you from learning the truth.
And what truth is that?
That's a very good question.
What is the... the...
There's only one god.
There is only one god.
In a nutshell, that's the truth.
We're alone here, aren't we?
The others aren't coming back soon.
And the door's locked.
All right, good.
Can you feel God's presence?
You know what? I think I do.
- So do I.
- Do you? Do you too?
We both... we both feel...
So what's Cottle's verdict?
Everything checks out.
So I'm me,
not a Cylon?
That is why you had me tested, right?
- Kara, nobody said you were Cylon.
- But you were thinking it.
We had to be sure, Kara.
Fair enough.
Let's go through it again.
How many times do you want to hear it?
As many times as it takes to make sense.
I followed a raider into the storm.
Took some hits, passed out.
When I came to,
I was orbiting this planet.
Its yellow moon and star matches
the description in Pythia.
I took these pictures in orbit.
The star patterns match
what we saw in the tomb of Athena.
- How did you get here?
- I told you, I don't know exactly.
Well, that's just
not good enough, Captain.
Tell us everything you remember.
I remember taking the photos.
Turning my ship in a reciprocal heading.
And then I'm not sure.
I must've blacked out again.
I remember
a giant gas planet with rings.
I remember a flashing triple star.
And a comet.
And then I was back with the fleet.
And for you, all of this took six hours.
I do not understand
the time discrepancy either, okay?
All I know is I was there.
I took the pictures.
I didn't imagine it!
I had my crew clean it up.
There's not a ding or a scratch on it.
It's got the same tail number
as the one she flew out on.
But I've been fixing up that old bird
since day one,
and this thing looks like
it's been rolled off the showroom floor.
So it's not the same ship.
Unless she found a hell of a body shop
out there, no, ma'am, it's not.
Admiral,
it's just not the outside either.
This is the data from the nav computer.
There isn't any. It's blank.
There's no record
of where this ship has been.
Okay.
- Put her in the brig.
- What?
So some things don't add up, and
we're back to thinking she's a Cylon?
- What about Cottle's test?
- Cottle's test doesn't prove anything.
Even if her DNA's the same,
she could still be a Cylon.
She could've been one
from the beginning.
Baltar's Cylon detector was a crock.
It failed to i.d. Boomer.
I know how you feel about her, Bill,
but that is exactly what the Cylons
could be counting on here.
We're back where we started from.
Could be Cylons right here, we wouldn't
know till they put a bullet in our head.
Or lead us into an ambush.
That cylon fleet had enough firepower
to blow us out of the sky,
but instead they ran and jumped.
And there's Kara Thrace suddenly
back from the dead having found Earth.
If Kara Thrace
can lead us off our course...
Course? What course?
The nebula was supposed to be another
clue on the way to Earth, but it...
The nebula
is only a road sign
along the way to Earth.
And we need to continue
to follow its path.
Well, what if Kara
is the clue
that we were supposed to find?
And what if she's playing you?
And what if she's playing you?
And all of us?
Gaius, please!
Gaius, please, can you help me?
What's going on?
- Oh, god...
- Watch his head.
- It's Derek.
- Derek, is it?
Derek, I see. Where are my clothes?
- It's okay.
- Is it?
- Did they give you a diagnosis?
- They said he's got...
- viral encephalitis.
- Viral?
I don't know,
it's some inflammation of the brain.
- Can't the doctors do something?
- Well, not if it's viral, no.
I'm afraid it's up to
Derek's immune system.
And he has to be strong.
And we have to be strong for him.
I didn't want him to die
in that sickbay, so...
So I brought him here.
So he can be with us.
All of us.
- Yeah, all of us.
- Give me your hand, please.
I wish there was...
You know I prayed for him, don't you?
- I know.
- I prayed for him.
I know.
I guess...
I guess that the one true god
just doesn't want him to live, right?
Anybody still hearing
that frakkin' song?
Nope.
Maybe it stopped
when we figured out who...
What we are.
Could have been some kind of trigger?
To switch us on?
You know, after that raider
scanned me with that red light,
damn thing just cut and ran.
They all did.
You think it recognized you as a Cylon?
I don't know.
Maybe that's why it didn't shoot me.
More important,
why didn't I shoot him?
Racetrack was right.
You just made a dumb nugget mistake.
Did I?
Maybe I was programmed
to leave my gun safeties on.
Those bastards can't program me
to help them.
No way.
Boomer thought the same thing.
- And then she shot the old man.
- Boomer didn't know what she was.
We do.
That is not gonna happen.
Agreed?
I don't know why I'm here.
Yes, I do.
I'm here because of the things
that we've shared
- and the things that we've seen...
- The visions in the opera house.
You went inside.
You saw more than I did.
I thought that maybe you could help me.
Help you how?
I need to know about the other five.
The types we've never seen.
The ones that
Baltar calls the final five.
And you want to know
if Kara Thrace is one of them.
Yes.
I've been programmed
never to think about them.
Well, your programming isn't working,
because you're thinking about them
right now.
I try not to.
Trying not to is thinking about them.
How do you rationalize that?
All right, no.
Back off. Don't leave, back off.
The five are close.
What?
I can feel them.
What about this one?
It's a protoplanetary system.
So?
Nothing but rocks.
No ringed gas giants
like you claimed you saw.
- I did see it, lieutenant.
- If you say so, sir.
- And what are you saying, Mr. Gaeta?
- I'm not saying anything, sir.
- I'm just following orders.
- Well, I'm ordering you to help me.
- You're ordering me...
- Mr. Gaeta, take a break.
With pleasure, sir.
Jump clock is running, Dee.
Take us out of here.
Yes, sir.
What's going on?
I see it on his face.
On all of their faces.
They don't believe me.
You want people to believe you?
Find that star system.
It's a big waste of time.
We've only been at it a few hours.
Found maybe a dozen trinaries.
- Baltar's calculations took months.
- It doesn't work like that.
How does it work, Kara?
It's a feeling.
An intuition.
I didn't use nav fixes
to get there and back.
When we were at that nebula,
it was so clear to me.
But every jump we take farther away,
the clarity fades.
If we keep jumping like this,
I won't be able to find our way back.
That'll be all.
All hands, prepare for jump in ten...
The President's adamant.
We're gonna continue on the course
laid out by the Eye of Jupiter.
<i>Five,</i>
<i>four,</i>
<i>three,</i>
<i>two, jump.</i>
We're going the wrong way.
If we keep jumping,
I'll lose the feeling completely
and I'll never be able to take us back.
What do you want me to do?
You want me to go to Laura Roslin,
tell her forget Pythia
and the Eye of Jupiter, because Kara
has some feeling about where Earth is?
Yes.
I can't.
I just left your ship.
There's not a scratch on it.
It's brand-new.
How do you explain that, Kara?
Look at me.
Look at me!
I swear to Gods...
It's me, Kara.
I can do this.
You said you loved me
like a daughter.
If you still do,
you've gotta trust me on this one.
I can't afford to.
<i>They're waiting for me.</i>
<i>No! No!</i>
<i>They're waiting for me.</i>
<i>No! No!</i>
What should I believe?
Should I believe my heart?
Or my eyes?
Well, you know where I stand.
I want to believe her.
But the President's right.
It's exactly what the Cylons
would be counting on.
So I guess you're not changing course.
For the time being,
we follow the President's lead.
She's still staying in your quarters?
Just till we find a place to put her up,
to finish the rest
of her Doloxan treatment.
I want to thank you
for suiting up during the fight.
We needed everyone up there.
We still do.
I took those off for the wrong reasons.
Put them back on.
Baltar's trial
may have been the trigger, but...
This is a feeling
I've been having for a while.
It's time for a change.
I need to move on.
I've had some feelers
from the government.
There's a position opening up.
And I think I can make
a valuable contribution there.
Maybe even more than in the cockpit.
Dad, what if Zak
had come back to us in that Viper?
If my brother
had climbed out of that cockpit...
Would it matter if he were a Cylon?
If he always had been?
When all's said and done...
would that change
how we really feel about him?
Please, God.
I'm only asking you this one last time.
Don't let this child die.
Has he sinned against you?
He can't have sinned against you.
He's not even had a life yet.
How can you take him and let me live?
After all I've done.
Really, if you want someone to suffer,
take me.
We both know I deserve it.
I have been selfish
and weak.
I have failed so many people.
And I have killed.
I'm not asking for your forgiveness.
I'm just asking
that you spare the life
of this innocent child.
Don't take him.
Take me.
Take me, take me please.
We were all very moved
by the way you prayed for Derek.
Fat lot of good it did him.
Unfortunately, he's worse,
if you hadn't realized.
Doesn't mean God didn't hear you.
I'm sure he's looking
after Derek's immortal soul.
Yes, I wish I shared your confidence
on that one. I really do.
But you have to keep the faith.
- We all look to you for guidance...
- Well, you shouldn't, should you?
I mean, you're just...
Well, you're very young and...
What are we doing here exactly?
Thank you.
Mr. President.
Gaius, let's go.
- We should get back, okay?
- Good to see you again.
I'm sorry. I can't...
We met at the groundbreaking ceremony
on New Caprica.
Introduced you to my son Kevin.
He told you he wanted to be President
when he grew up.
You told him that he could be
if he stuck to his schoolwork.
He's a redhead little boy, isn't he?
- About eight or nine years old...
- Seven.
Seven years old.
How is...
Kevin.
- How is he?
- He's dead.
- Your police shot him.
- Come on, Gaius, let's get out of here.
- Leave her alone!
- Look at me!
- Leave her alone!
- Look at me!
Go on, scream.
Come on, scream!
I want to see
if anyone comes to help you.
Scream!
Beg.
I bet you begged the Cylons.
Why don't you beg for me?
Come on, beg!
Get up! Get on your knees!
Get up!
You asked God to take your life
instead of the boy's.
Did you mean it?
Yes.
Do it.
Take my life.
Please.
Please.
Please take my life.
You see?
Gaius, I knew God wouldn't desert you.
I felt his love course through me,
giving me the strength to smite them.
Less smiting next time, unless you want
to be held up on murder charges.
- Gaius!
- You two, watch the door.
Are you all right?
I cut myself shaving.
Well, you have to come.
You have to come and see Derek.
- Derek? Derek, yes.
- God answered your prayers.
- What?
- You have to see. Look.
Look at him.
- And no trace of a fever.
- No.
It's a miracle.
No one took it down.
Not the old man, not Lee.
Not even you, Sam.
You just got back, Kara.
We're trying to get a handle on this.
You gotta cut people some slack.
Cut yourself some too.
When I...
woke up orbiting earth, I just figured
it was some crazy dream, but...
I went in following a Heavy Raider.
I mean, maybe the Cylons
pulled me out of the soup,
captured me, brainwashed me.
On Caprica,
when they experiment on me,
did they take pieces of me?
Is it possible that they grew me,
another me in a petri dish,
or they embedded me with the memories
or it with the memories, or...
I don't know.
Kara, no.
Listen to me.
If you were a Cylon,
then you've been one from the beginning.
Like Boomer.
Spend my entire life
thinking I'm one thing...
Yeah, and then you wake up one day
and discover you're another.
It still doesn't change
who you really are.
It still doesn't change the fact
that I love you no matter what.
You are a better person than I am, Sam,
because if I found out
that you were a Cylon,
I would put a bullet between your eyes.
<i>All hands, prepare for jump</i>
<i>in four, three,</i>
<i>two,</i>
Damn it, they're still going
in the wrong direction.
One more jump
and I'm gonna lose my way altogether.
All right, we gotta find you a rack.
Okay, take it easy.
It's Roslin. The old man is not
gonna listen to me as long as she's...
- I gotta get to her.
- You can't do that.
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.
No, no, wait!
What the hell are you doing, Kara?
Where's the president, Sam?
Kara, come on.
 - =( Team Lords of Kobol )= -
<i>Previously on</i> Battlestar Galactica...
Aurora, Goddess of the dawn.
I thought  it would be a nice figurehead
for your model ship.
- A fresh start.
- Thank you.
- <i>Starbuck, you're getting too low!</i>
- Come on, Lee, get her out of there.
- You come back!
- Just let me go.
No!
Baltar's trial
may have been the trigger,
but this is a feeling
I've been having for a while.
It's time for a change.
Please, God, don't let this child die.
How can you take him and let me live?
God answered your prayers.
You have to see.
- Look at him.
- And no trace of a fever.
No.
It's a miracle.
I need to know about the other five.
The types we've never seen.
It's true.
We're Cylons.
And we have been from the start.
Even after that Raider scanned me
with that red light,
damn thing just cut and ran.
You think it recognized you as a Cylon?
Maybe that's why it didn't shoot me.
More important,
why didn't I shoot him?
Okay, what the hell's going on?
- I'm off the ship for a few hours...
- A few hours?
Kara, you were gone for over two months.
That's impossible.
How did you get here?
I told you, I don't know exactly.
Damn it, they're still going
in the wrong direction.
One more jump and I'm gonna lose
my way altogether.
It's Roslin.
The old man's not gonna listen to me.
I gotta get to her.
No, wait!
Look alive! And for frak sake,
don't shoot the godsdamned President!
Just let me talk to her.
Talk all you want,
but it ends with the first bang.
<i>We're rollin' down here.
Starbuck's got the President.</i>
Gaeta, take the com.
Move.
Move!
Come on.
Move, come on!
Over by the couch.
Now!
I want to hate you so much.
So much.
You had a vision, remember?
The arrow, the temple.
I went down to that planet with you,
and it was a frakkin' toaster party.
A lot of good people died, remember?
Yes, I do.
I trusted you.
On a vision.
That's it...
a vision!
I saw...
Earth.
I saw it with my own eyes.
And it's calling me back.
We're going the wrong way.
Why can't you trust me?
Shoot me.
If you think I'm a Cylon,
them I'm your enemy.
Shoot your enemy.
Take it!
I'm no more a Cylon than you are.
And you know it.
I wish I did.
I've put my life on the line
for this frakkin' ship.
I have ate, slept, and fought
next to the people that I love.
I have pissed off my friends!
I have broken more rules
than I've followed!
I frakked up, okay! I messed up!
But it's all that I have.
Those people are my family.
And none of us belong here.
Two down. We've got two down!
Shoot me!
If I'm a Cylon, shoot me!
They made you perfect, didn't they?
Down on the floor now!
- Now!
- Let go of me!
Get off me! Get off me!
What are you doing?
I am not a Cylon, Mathias!
- Madam President.
- Gods!
What the frak's going on here?
I thought you were on the move.
She's out of her frakkin' mind.
Gods!
- You all right?
- Get off me!
Get off!
Listen to me, please.
I'm losing it.
The ringing...
The way to Earth...
It's getting weaker.
Don't you understand?
Don't any of you understand?!
It was so... It was so clear.
Like it was coming from the next room.
Stop looking at me like that.
I can feel it slipping away.
Even without jumping, as we move,
it's half of what it was
when I got here.
Half.
If we keep jumping, it'll be gone,
and we'll never find it again.
I thought that's what we wanted.
A way to Earth.
- Do you hear me?
- Get her out of here.
- Yes, sir. Let's go!
- You better work on your aim,
because I'm not gonna stop!
You're gonna have to kill me!
One more jump and it'll be gone!
Admiral!

The excited state decays
by vibrational relaxation
into the first excited singlet state.
Yes, yes, and merrily we go.
Reduce atmospheric nitrogen by 0.03%.
It is not much consolation
that society will pick up the bits,
leaving us at eight modern
where punishment,
rather than interdiction, is paramount.
Please, cut the fuse.
They will not harm their own.
End of line.
Limiting diffusions to two dimensions
increases the number of
evolutionary jumps within the species.
Rise and measure the temple of the five.
Transformation is the goal.
They will not harm their own.
Datafont synchronization complete.
The hybrid
is clearly telling us something.
The hybrid
is always telling us something.
They're supposed to maintain operations
on each ship,
not vomit metaphysics.
All right,
I give up. What...
What is she trying to tell us?
They're in the colonial fleet...
With the humans.
"They"?
They who?
The Final Five.
The Raiders refuse to fight
because they sense
the Final Five might be
- in the colonial fleet.
- They could have been caught or hiding.
No way, stop.
Stop, right now.
Turn around,
go and take a cleansing walk,
and I am gonna try
and forget what I just heard.
The Final Five... Cavil, they're near.
This is far too important.
What their eyes must have seen,
witnessed over time...
- Think they look anything like us?
- That's enough!
Don't you realize what you're doing?
You're openly discussing the Final Five!
That's forbidden!
You're toying with our survival.
Look at yourselves.
Look,
there's millions of Twos have that nose.
Millions of Sixes possess that mouth.
Eights share those breasts,
and Ones have this brain.
We're mechanized copies.
There's a reason
the original programmers clearly felt
that it's a mistake
for us to contact the Final Five!
- No!
- Violating that programming
threatens our survival!
Something has changed.
Thoughts have changed.
Yes, they change. The Raiders changed.
That's where all this started,
with them.
Somehow they exceeded their programming,
and unlike us,
they can't correct themselves.
So we're gonna have to do it for them.
Do what?
We'll reconfigure
their neural architecture,
and shave down
their heuristic responses.
Dumb them down? Lobotomize them?
They're tools, not pets.
But in any case, it has to be done.
Says who?
Says God almighty,
the voice of reason, that's who!
When are you gonna hear it?
You don't have the authority to make
any change without a majority vote.
Well, we'll vote.
The Fours and Fives will be on my side.
There will be a vote.
The Raiders hear what we hear.
The Raiders are simple machines.
No.
Something extraordinary has happened.
Something is calling to us.
Pushing us to discover our origins,
to understand our place in the universe.
The Raiders are part of that,
and the Final Five...
Are anywhere but with the humans.
You're late.
I had to wait
for Cally to nod off, okay?
- She's having trouble sleeping.
- Did you see Kara?
I saw her. She's crazy as a latrine rat.
If anything,
she's more like Starbuck than ever.
She's my wife!
And the President nearly
put a bullet in her skull
because she suspected her
of being a Cylon.
You are one!
We bring attention to ourselves,
we're frakked!
If Starbuck is one of us,
she's playing it big the other way.
The four of us heard the music
and sought each other out.
She hasn't.
We're still missing one.
Baltar.
Not Baltar, but...
when I found him
in the temple on the algae planet,
he was with one of those skin jobs.
The one they call D'Anna.
She saw something in there...
I don't know what. But they talked.
He might know something.
He's got those
one-God nutcases
believing he's some kind of healer.
He brought some boy out from a coma.
Maybe he knows who the fifth is.
Maybe he knows who we are.
Then we gotta get in close and find out.
How do you propose we do that?
Take him out for drinks?
Well, he is accomplished at two things.
Lying in his cell, and lying in a woman.
He'd poke a skin job.
He racked up a Six... That's a given.
There is no way.
You don't have to get
on your back for him, but...
Oh, gee, thanks.
What were you doing?
What were you thinking?
What happened to you?
I saw...
Earth.
The shape of it, the smell of it.
The feel of it on my skin in my pores.
And I swear to you,
it was like I'd been there before.
Like I never left.
You're too stupid to figure out
you just screwed over
the one ally you had.
You didn't have the guts to hold on.
Tell me...
Who's gonna help you?
Yeah, frak me, huh?
It sure as hell isn't gonna be you.
You've gotta remind yourself
that you're somebody else.
You're the President's wet nurse.
You're the one
who doesn't have the guts.
Nice to know you still care, Admiral.
We're going the wrong way!
We have all conferred with our models,
and the results are in.
The Fours and the Fives
have joined us Ones,
and they voted
to reconfigure the Raiders.
Gee, what a surprise.
Well, the Twos, Sixes and Eights
voted against it, so we're deadlocked.
How hopelessly... But you were right.
And I'm machine enough
- to admit that I was wrong.
- What are you talking about?
Something extraordinary
has happened.
Eight.
What's going on?
Boomer.
I'm not going
to sugarcoat this.
I'll just say that this Eight
- has voted to reconfigure.
- What?
Shocked? I was shocked too.
But no one has ever voted
against their model.
No one. Is this true?
We have to be able to defend ourselves.
No, this is unconscionable.
This is wrong. She can't.
- You had something to do with this.
- No, it was her decision totally.
- You cannot allow this.
- There is no law. There's no edict.
There's nothing that forbids it.
It's just...
It's never happened before.
Try and remember you said that
when he boxes your line.
Now, don't be a sore loser.
If you do this, we all lose.
- We think it's for the best.
- The best?
Have you lost your mind?
Our identies are determined
by our models. Each model is unique.
We belong together.
You know this better than anyone.
"Mechanized copies."
- Those are your very words.
- "Something has changed."
Those are your very words.
And I whole heartedly agree.
The Raiders are sentient,
just as we are.
There was a plan.
A divine plan in our design.
- You're butchering them.
- We're reconfiguring them.
You are not God.
No... I'm a mechanic.
The Raiders were designed
to do a specific job.
They stopped doing it. I'm fixing that.
And when the cutting's all done,
they'll go back to being happy warriors.
So let's move on, all right?
I'll pray for you.
I'll pray hard.
All right, you hooch hounds!
Lock it up!
It's time... Shut the frak up!
Pay attention.
We're saying good-bye...
to the best damn jock you...
pink-ass cones will ever hope to see.
Shut up.
Major?
- Let's go!
- Come on!
- I have a drink.
- Let's do this. Come on now.
I'm not thirsty.
To Galactica!
To the men and women of Galactica.
To the Admiral...
... who commands
the men and women of Galactica.
And to our sweethearts,
husbands, and wives.
To our sweethearts!
To absent friends.
Thank you.
That's very sweet.
Excuse me, will you?
Watch your step.
- You say what?
- Excuse me.
You're spying on me, Tory.
I've seen you here.
No. I heard about the miracle.
The child?
Yes.
You mean Laura Roslin
has heard about it.
All right, I have been spying on you.
Well, it's lucky
I was sitting down, isn't it?
I've been watching these people.
The way they look at you.
If you go squealing to the President
that my newfound popularity borders
on the phenomenal,
- then she should be very worried.
- I came here on my own.
And I slept with your boss last night.
Come on, be nice.
- What's it gonna cost you?
- My God.
My giddy-od!
Get a grip, Gaius.
She's not lying. She really could be
a wonderful source of information.
- Why don't you feel her out?
- Feel her what?
- What?
- I'm not talking to you. Actually...
Try and forget me for a moment.
- Ask her what she's doing here.
- I am talking to you.
- Why did you come here?
- Maybe it was a mistake.
Well, I can't stop thinking
about what's happened.
You were found innocent
when everyone hated you. I hated you.
And this healed boy,
the return of Kara Thrace...
I mean, everyone thought she was dead.
- So perhaps there are miracles.
- Perhaps.
Thing is, somehow you seem
to be at the center of them.
Yes, I do, don't I?
I don't understand myself, to be honest.
Just...
Well, it seems that
God has chosen me
to sing his song.
- A song?
- Music. Did you say music?
Yeah, you know, it's funny.
It's a lot like that. It's...
It's like the distant chaos
of an orchestra
tuning up.
And then
somebody waves a magic wand,
and all of those notes
start to slide into place.
A grotesque,
screeching cacophony
becomes a single melody.
I really shouldn't be seen here.
Who the frak are you?!
What, am I supposed to be impressed?
I mean, you're me.
Obviously you're me, so...
Unless you're not me. Huh?
Six?
Is it you, Six...
Like in disguise?
Now, why would she need
to disguise herself from you?
- Well, you've got a very good point.
- Let's talk about Tory.
- Where is she?
- We should talk about Tory,
'cause we both know
where this is heading.
You like her, don't you?
Yeah, well, you know, she's...
She's a sexy lady.
Yeah, yeah.
Hot.
- You slay me. You really do, Gaius.
- Why?
She's more than all these things.
She's special.
And you feel it.
Yeah, fragile.
Yeah, I sense that too.
You're very observant.
Fragile.
Handle with care.
Oh, I'd love to.
You're enjoying that more than usual.
Hair of the dog.
Lee's party.
What do we do now? Put her on trial?
Find Romo Lampkin?
Take a show of hands?
I don't know.
Follow her into an ambush?
- She is driven.
- Yeah.
You gonna keep waltzing,
or are you gonna sit down and talk?
What's going on? Sit.
What if she's telling the truth?
She was supposed to die out there.
She didn't. I can't explain it.
What if she was meant to help us?
And this was a...
A what?
A miracle?
Is that what you want to call this?
Go ahead, say it.
Grab your piece of the golden arrow.
I want to hear
Admiral Atheist say
that a miracle happened.
You shot at her
and you missed at close range.
Doloxan fraks with your aim.
So does doubt.
I pulled the trigger
and I'd do it again.
She put her life in front of a bullet
as if it had no meaning.
You drop an egg, you reach for another.
Maybe convincing you
meant more to her than her own life.
Is that your miracle?
You want to talk about miracles?
The very same day
that a very pale doctor informed me
that I had terminal cancer,
most of humanity was annihilated,
and I survived.
And by some mathematical absurdity,
I became President.
And then
my cancer disappeared
long enough for us
to find a way to Earth.
You can call it whatever you want.
And now I'm dying.
Don't talk that way.
You've gotta face this.
My life is coming to an end soon enough,
and I am not going to apologize
to you for not trusting her.
And I am not...
I am not going to trust
her with the fate of this fleet.
You are so buckled up inside...
You can't take any more loss.
Your son's leaving...
This, me... I know it.
No one's going anywhere.
Okay...
Here's the truth.
This is what's going on.
You want to believe Kara.
You would rather be wrong about her
and face your own demise
than risk losing her again.
You can stay in the room, but
get out of my head.
You're so afraid to live alone.
And you're afraid to die that way.
You're afraid that you may not be
the dying leader you thought you were.
Or that your death may be as
meaningless
as everyone else's.
Zarek nominated me
for the vacant quorum spot, so I...
You're Zarek's wing man.
All right,
all right, you know, stow it, okay.
I've heard it all before.
The guy's a piece of work, I know.
His head's as big as
the house I grew up in but...
I'm... I'm pretty new to all this.
I could use the help.
Besides, I never really
could say no to anything.
Except me.
Especially you.
You know, I think I finally understand
what you meant about
having a destiny.
I've got to do this.
And the fact that I don't
have an explanation why doesn't...
Doesn't really seem to matter anymore.
So say we all.
So say we all.
Good luck on your journey, Lee Adama.
You too, Kara Thrace.
All right.
Lee...
I believe you.
<i>Red and blue sections will go first,
yellow and green will follow.</i>
<i>Starbuck, if you've got a problem,
I don't want to hear it.</i>
<i>My only problem is you didn't preach
that sermon a week ago.</i>
<i>Keep your ears open. Any Cylon contact,
just shut down, bug out.</i>
<i>- Questions.
- When will you play to the card game?</i>
<i>- We're on tomorrow night!
- All right, all right.</i>
<i>Good luck.
And be careful out there.</i>
Attention to orders!
In recognition of honorable,
loyal, and faithful service,
Madam President,
Admiral of the Colonial Fleet,
ladies and gentlemen...
Major Lee Adama...
Salute!
Good luck.
Thank you.
Well, it looks like you got the house.
I'll miss you.
Good-bye, Lee.
Look after yourself.
We want you
to stop lobotomizing the Raiders, Cavil.
Raiders with free will?
Not going to happen.
Do you know
what just really rankles my ass?!
You've been pointing fingers,
falsely accusing me
of manipulation just short of tyranny.
When you're the one
that's been leading the charge here.
We want you to stop.
You're not in charge.
We had a vote.
For the last time,
will you stop lobotomizing the Raiders?
It's unbelievable, isn't it?
Unbelievable.
For the last time,
no.
I was afraid you'd say that.
Come in.
What is this about?
Centurions can't vote, Six.
They're not here to vote, Cavil.
- Am I hurting you?
- No.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
What do you mean, nothing?
You're crying.
It's just something I do during sex.
- All the time?
- Yeah.
I'm really sorry.
Don't be sorry.
Why should you apologize?
You should be thankful.
You have an abundance of feeling.
I've never
really thought of it like that.
You're blessed, aren't you?
I don't know.
I guess.
I suppose I couldn't be a Cylon.
Well, I don't know about that.
Human beings don't exclusively
hold the patent on suffering.
Cylons can feel.
- You believe that?
- Yeah, I do, actually.
I've spent time amongst them.
Man may have made them,
but God's at the beginning
of the string, isn't he?
It's God who made the real soul.
The one true God.
One God?
The one true God.
You know, I'm becoming
increasingly tired of holding that in.
Of denying that essential truth.
Now, this... This isn't funny.
Leave.
I said leave!
Why don't they leave?
The telencephalic inhibitor
that restricts higher functions
in the Centurions...
- We had them removed.
- Say what?!
You dumbed down the Raiders.
We the Leobens, the Sharons,
gave the Centurions the gift of reason.
You have no authority to do this, none.
You can't do anything without a vote!
No, we can't do anything with one,
so we're finished voting.
What have you done?
First thing they learned is
what you were doing to the Raiders.
You can imagine how they felt.
Oh, no.
Sir, the fleet is prepped
and ready for jump.
Execute jump.
Go back!
Go back...
Open cell.
Cuff her.
So...
You quietly cut me loose in deep space.
I'm not afraid to die.
Little easier
after you've been through it once.
Harder.
Especially now
that I'm seeing things so clearly.
You're making a mistake.
Maybe I am.
But I can't take the chance
that you're right
and not do something about it.
Helo hand-picked a crew for you.
I'm giving you a ship.
I hope you can stand the smell.
We liberated the Demetrius.
It's a sewage recycling ship.
The party line will be
that we're going for a scouting mission.
Looking for food.
So you think I'm right.
Maybe, maybe not.
But I know she is, the President.
She's been right all along.
I'm tired of losing.
I'm tired of turning away from
the things that I want to believe in.
And I believe you when you say
that you'll die before you stop trying.
And I won't lose you again.
Now go.
Find a way to Earth.

<i>Previously on</i> Battlestar Galactica...
We're Cylons.
And we have been from the start.
It's time for a change.
I've had some feelers
from the government.
I think I could make a valuable
contribution there.
I'm giving you a ship.
Now go find a way to Earth.
There are five other Cylons, brother.
I saw them.
Yes, we know.
That's why we've decided
to box your entire line.
The telencephalic inhibitor
that restricts higher functions
in the Centurions?
- We had them removed.
- Say what?!
Welcome back, brother.
- What happened?
- You were shot, but you're with us now.
Shot by who?
By our own Centurions.
That's pure insanity.
The Sixes have lost their minds.
They have no idea of the threat
that they've unleashed.
I need to get to my ship.
It's not your ship anymore.
The Sixes and their acolytes
used their new pets
to engage in a little ethnic cleansing.
The fleet's split right down the middle.
So much for my swing vote.
That'll teach me
not to trust in democracy.
They can't possibly need you
every single hour, every single day.
Can't you just tell someone
to fill in for you?
Who, Cally?
Who's gonna fill in for me?
I don't know! Anyone can frakkin' turn
a wrench down there. There's not...
I'm the chief of the frak...
I've had enough of this.
Yes!
Dualla, it's me again.
No, I know, I'm sorry.
Can you please just check?
<i>I used to know who I was.</i>
Galen Tyrol.
Crew chief, husband,
father.
I look in the mirror nowadays,
I don't even know what I am.
Are you and Cally getting along?
You know,
I never really liked ambrosia before.
But now...
It's like I'm being flooded
with new sensations and new feelings.
Maybe you are too.
In some ways, I don't hate this.
Feeling new.
Feeling open to things.
To change.
I don't do well with change.
Galen, you son of a...
Cally, come here.
Just give her some room.
- Let go of me! Let go!
- Just listen to me for a second.
Cally, listen to me.

The nausea should go away
in about an hour.
<i>Love and Bullets</i>, by Nick Talo.
Chapter one.
"It started like it always did.
"With a body.
"This one was in the river.
"I could tell
she had once been beautiful.
"But this a bullet and fast current
had taken away from her.
"All we are,
all that we think we are,
"all that we are certain about
is taken away from us.
"When you've worked the streets
and seen what I've seen,
"you become more and more
convinced of it every day.
"Caprica City had been my teacher,
my mistress.
"From the moment I open my eyes,
"she's in my blood, like cheap wine...
"bitter and sweet,
"tinged with regret.
"I'll never be free of her,
"nor do I want to be.
"For she is what I am.
"All that is...
"should always be."
I am grateful
and consistently inspired
by the compassionate
and forthright leadership
of President Roslin.
By the wisdom of my father,
whom some of you may know.
And by the support and advice
of my valued friends.
Some of whom,
you may be shocked to hear,
are not Capricans.
And so I am honored
to accept this appointment
to the Quorum
in the hope that I can continue
Delegate Cowan's courageous work
on behalf of the people of Caprica
and the fleet.
Thank you.
Madam President,
by confirming Mr. Adama's nomination,
does it mean you don't have
any hard feelings
about his role
in the Baltar trial?
Thank you very much.
Mr. Adama took on a cause
he felt was important.
And I fully trust
he will continue to bring
the same passion
and clear-mindedness
in representing his constituents.
- Yes?
- What about the Demetrius?
The sewage recycling freighter
that jumped away three weeks ago.
I will ask Admiral Adama
to answer that question.
The Demetrius is on a military mission.
What about the rumor that Kara Thrace
was put in charge of that mission?
I don't comment on rumors.
I'm gonna have to cut this short.
I will see you all very soon
at the Quorum Q&A. Thank you very much.
Frankly, I'm surprised
it took them this long
to come after us about the Demetrius.
Any luck and it'll blow over.
It's not going to blow over.
I'm gonna be covering
for you for a long time on this.
I wanted to give Kara a chance.
I wanted to give myself
a chance to believe in her.
Apparently.
You wanted to see me, Sir?
I've made a decision.
Caps and recon runs.
Okay, anyone want to remind me
what we're supposed to be looking for?
Didn't you get the commander's memo?
It's a unique astronomic cluster.
A system with a ringed gas giant,
trinary star, and a comet.
Astronomic cluster.
Sounds more like a cluster frak.
That's enough of that crap.
Sorry, Sir, but you gotta admit
it's starting to feel like
we're flying around in circles.
What's the latest, Felix?
She's reversing course,
returning to sector seven.
That is the tenth course correction.
Did she give a reason this time?
A reason? Let's just say
I think she's steering with her gut.
Frak me.
I'm telling you guys,
this thing is a setup anyway.
You think that the old man just gave her
the ship and then cut her loose?
I guarantee you
Galactica's dogging our every move,
and they're waiting to jump in
as soon as she shows her true colors.
You don't know
what you're talking about.
- You gonna tell me what I know, rook?
- Yeah, maybe.
I said to can it!
All of you!
Helo, I need to talk to you.
Now!
Who wants odds
on a course correction then?
Kara, hey, listen.
Some of us have been wondering
about this trinary star formation
we're supposed to be looking for.
Is there anything
else you can tell us about it?
Any new data? Anything at all?
You know everything
you need to know, ensign.
So stow the questions and do your job.
Yes, Sir.
- What's up, Captain?
- Helo, I have new jump coordinates.
Double check
the data file and the FTL drive.
Got it?
Cally, I told you last night
and I'm telling you again right now.
I am not having an affair.
I went out for a drink.
I ran into Tory. We started talking.
Look, I know how it looks,
but it's completely innocent.
There's nothing to it.
You'll have to drop Nicky off.
I have a doctor's appointment.
Can you tell them
not to feed him any of that algae mash?
I think he's allergic.
Just remember about the algae.
No, I'm sorry. Daddy's sorry.
Hey, come here. I'm sorry.
I see you're still
cleaning up your mess.
Oh, I hardly think
this qualifies as our mess.
Well, I guess that explains why none
of you are lending a helping hand.
Really, Six,
if you had wanted
some room to spread out,
you could've just asked.
Is there anything
that isn't fodder for a joke with you?
Or is that really
how you see our very existence?
As some sort of nihilistic punch line?
Nihilistic punch line? I like that.
But quite honestly, I'm feeling...
very serious.
Getting riddled
with bullets affects me that way.
But I want you all to know
that I place the blame
for all of this squarely on myself.
Go on.
Well, you had legitimate concerns,
but I refused to hear them.
But now I'm listening.
So tell me, what's to be done to stop
all this and let us get back together?
Well,
for starters,
you can stop lobotomizing the Raiders.
Done.
And you can agree to unbox the D'Annas.
Resurrect her entire line?
Don't forget, Six,
it was D'Anna's messianic quest
for secrets better left alone
that started us down
this divisive path in the first place.
You talk about restoring our unity.
Well, we think it's time
to restore our greater unity.
To unite the 12 models
once and for all.
Well, I don't think
the others will accept this, but...
I'll make your case.
Escort him off the ship.
Please.
It's a good thing
you remembered the magic word.
You're going to find you opened
a bigger can of worms than you realize.
Inspiring, isn't it?
A government of the people,
for the people,
and answerable to the people.
At least that's the idea.
- I heard you tried to see her.
- I had some bills I wanted to discuss.
Projects delegate Cowan
was pushing before she died.
- But they told me she wasn't in.
- She was,
just not for you.
By standing up for Baltar,
you crossed the line with her.
And Laura Roslin is not the type
to forgive and forget.
She forgave you.
She made you vice President.
To keep me on the sidelines.
Same way she'll try to sideline you.
Well, then...
I'm intrigued. Why did you...
nominate me in the first place?
Because you did stand up for Baltar.
And you put Roslin
on the stand to do it.
You weren't afraid
to ask some hard questions
and to demand some honest answers.
Well, if you're looking for a repeat
performance, you're out of luck.
I didn't take this job to help you
undermine the President.
I'm not asking you to.
Believe it or not,
I'm on Laura's side.
Okay, then what's the problem?
It's amazing the things you start
to notice when you're on the sidelines,
how every decision
that Laura and your father make
gets stamped "classified".
Or how her directives
are starting to read like decrees,
yet still get enacted
without so much as a debate.
You know, she won't even allow
records to be kept
of any of her meetings.
Secrecy and control
are becoming obsessions for her.
I think this Demetrius business
is just the tip of the iceberg.
Well, sometimes
a benevolent tyrant's
exactly what you need.
No.
A tyrant craves power for its own sake.
And all Laura wants
is to save us all.
Trust me.
Better yet, trust yourself.
Because that's what
I'm really counting on.
That you're not the kind of man
who can ignore the truth...
when it stares you in the face.
What if you gave me a sedative
and I just slept here?
Oh, sure.
We'll just turn my sickbay
in an opium den
so you can have a little snooze.
Feels like I haven't had
a night's sleep since...
we reached that frakkin' nebula.
How are things on the home front?
You mean other than catching my husband
with another woman
and having him tell me
I'm imagining things?
The man doesn't know
what he's got at home.
Should have his head examined.
As a matter of fact,
why don't you bring him in?
I'll take a look.
See, that's what I like about you, Doc.
You just pretend to be a bastard.
While you're in the mood for tough love,
maybe you are imagining things.
You know, fatigue and antidepressants
can make a hell of a paranoia cocktail.
I felt like I need to take something
to keep from going completely crazy.
You're not crazy.
What would you call someone
who all but proposes to a man
after he breaks her jaw?
That the last time he laid hands on you?
You want to hear something really sick?
Sometimes I wish he would.
Lay hands on me.
At least then I'd... I'd know
he had some feelings about me.
Listen, just get some sleep
and clear your head.
Will do, Doc.
Thank you.
Kara, what the hell's
the matter with you?
'Cause the way you're holing up in here,
you're making people wonder.
Let 'em.
Frankly, they're starting to bug me
as much as I bug them.
Frak 'em.
You know, some of us
actually volunteered for this mission.
Some meaning you?
Is that what this is about, Sam?
You want to know what the deal
is with us? With our marriage?
Well, it didn't make much sense
to begin with. Makes even less now.
Give me that.
I don't buy that.
I don't think you believe
a single frakkin' word you're saying.
You're just scared.
You see that?
You see this? You remember those?
Do you remember when we got 'em?
That's what's real.
That's part of who we are.
That is a part of who you are,
whether you want to admit it or not.
You dumb motherfrakker.
I only married you because it was safe
and it was easy, Sam.
And you were just pathetic
enough to go along with it.
So get the frak out.
I said get out.
Get out!
I don't want to fight, Sam.
I want to frak.
You don't get it, do you?
I'm not the same girl you married.
All I want to do right now is frak.
Really frak, like it's the end
of the world and nothing else matters.
So come on, Sam.
Make me feel something.
I dare you.
We were married,
weren't we?
I mean, that wasn't just like a fantasy.
Hell, no.
And I got the scars to prove it.
Does that seem different to you somehow?
Different how?
Not sure.
It's like everything seems so far away.
The way things feel.
The way they taste.
Like I'm watching myself, but
I'm not really experiencing it, not...
... living it.
Like my body's just this alien thing
that I'm still attached to.
Does that seem crazy to you?
Frankly,
we were as surprised as you are.
We presented your case.
There was some debate.
And we were outvoted.
Our compatriots now seem to agree
that it was wrong to box the D'Annas.
It sounds like your own opinion
hasn't changed.
I promised that we'd do
some hard thinking.
But in the end, we decided
that our choices were correct.
Unfortunately, restoring unity
was all the others seemed to care about.
It's hard to have unity when you're
so opposed to everything we believe in.
Look, he kept his word.
You won the day. Do you think you have
the right to win our hearts and minds?
No, you're being presumptuous.
- Don't compare us to...
- They're right.
If they've agreed to our terms,  there's
no point in courting any more discord.
Any more discord
and we may run out of spare bodies.
The Three's core consciousness
is being downloaded
at our central resurrection hub.
The nearest accessible server
is a half dozen jumps from here.
We can go together and hear
what your newfound heroine has to say.
If you don't mind,
we'd prefer to stay on our own ships.
By all means.
I'd doubt that the rest of us
would feel comfortable here anyway.
The chair recognizes
the delegate from Sagittaron.
Would the President care to comment
on the news stories crediting
so-called military sources
that claim the Demetrius
is searching for new food sources?
Or, Madame President,
would you rather that we just
simply accept
this obvious attempt at disinformation?
Order, please.
I'm afraid I don't control the media,
Jacob, as much as you know I'd love to.
Regarding the reports,
the Demetrius mission
is a matter of fleet security,
and as such
I can't and won't discuss it, period.
Madame President, I have to say
that my constituency is not satisfied...
Do you realize this casts doubt
on something
as fundamental as our route to Earth?
Yes, but don't take my "yes"
to imply that the rumors are true.
- Madame President!
- Jacob, Aaron, everyone, please.
I can not believe that the Demetrius
is the only matter
that is important to your constituents.
Can we please move on?
You know my answer to this.
You can tell your free trade deal
good-bye.
You can kiss my ass.
Order, please.
Order!
Madame President,
I'm sure we can all understand
the importance
for the need for security.
Coming from the military,
it's my experience that we sometimes err
too strongly on the side of caution.
So, for the sake
of reassuring my colleagues
and hopefully
putting this matter to rest,
would it not be fair to say
that you and Admiral Adama
are naturally exploring
all possible routes to Earth?
Hear, hear. Now we're getting focus.
That's exactly what we need.
Mr. Adama, we are all anxious
to receive
the benefit of your experience.
But,
I personally don't feel the need
to have a junior delegate
appoint himself my spokesman.
Let's move on. Jacob,
you had a matter on the table.
Would you please continue?
Thank you, Madame President.
My constituents
- are having problems obtaining...
- Point of order.
Now, I have prepared
a report that I think we...
- Point of order, mister Vice President.
- Excuse me. Hello?
Order, please!
Order, please!
Thank you very, very much. Mr. Cantrell,
- will you yield the floor?
- I will yield.
Thank you.
This relates
to your executive order 112.
112.
Which establishes a system of tribunals.
The judges are chosen by you.
Answerable
only to a special court of appeals,
the judges of which
would also be chosen by you.
Effectively it creates
a justice system that further
and dangerously concentrates power
into the hands of the executive.
Namely, into your hands,
Madame President.
Far from being independent or impartial,
it would actually damage
the very idea of justice. Even
the illusion of the idea of justice.
Thank you, Mr. Adama.
And the order you're referring to,
executive order 112,
is actually a work in progress,
and the changes it proposes
are provisional.
It is a first step,
a tiny step, but the first step
in a... in a larger plan,
actually, to create a fair
and comprehensive legal system,
which you of all people
can admit we sorely need.
Now naturally I was going to bring it
to the Quorum to open it up for debate
once it was finished, which it isn't.
But since you've brought it
into the public today,
I propose that we put it on the dock
for the next full session.
Is that satisfactory to you, Mr. Adama?
The resurrection ship
didn't make the jump.
- Problem with their FTL?
- No report.
Now Cavil's baseships
are breaking formation,
taking positions around our periphery.
They're going to attack.
Alert the others!
We need to jump now.
- They've taken out our FTL!
- No resurrection ship.
They're trying to kill us.
Just remember...
They started it.
But we're killing them.
We're truly killing them.
My own sisters.
They can trust their God
to watch over their immortal souls.
And what about ours?
We're machines, dear, remember?
We don't have souls.
<i>Now I've heard everything.</i>
<i>Anders and Gaius frakkin' Baltar.</i>
<i>- ... Cylon nymphomaniac.
- Don't worry, Colonel.</i>
<i>- You're not my type.
- And one more thing.</i>
From now on we only meet in private
after that scene you two pulled
in Joe's bar the other night,
we can't risk any more attention.
- Fine, great. We done, can we go?
- Why are you so antsy?
I told Cally I'd check on her.
Well, didn't you do that
when you got my note?
What note?
The note I left in the drop
in your quarters about this meeting.
Tory found me. Did you... Frak me.
- If Cally finds the note then...
- You better hope she doesn't.
And you better put an end
to this affair business.
Whatever it takes
to stop her from nosing around.
Last thing we need
is for your Cylon-hating wife
to find out there's a bunch of skinjobs
running around this ship
and that her husband is one of them.
I'm tired of looking
at your sorry faces.
Frak! Frak!
How you doing?
Fine.
You feeling okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Sure?
Yeah, actually, I am.
Thought I was coming down
with something, so I slept in.
- Did you go see Cottle?
- No, I'm feeling better.
Good.
Look, I know it's been
a rough couple of weeks.
I know what you're thinking.
It's not true.
It isn't?
No.
I'm not having an affair.
I figured it out.
I know what's important.
You're important.
Nicky's important.
We're important. Us.
That's really what it's all about,
isn't it? A family, a future.
Building that future together.
I promise you from now on
I will be here for us.
The three of us.
Maybe the four of us.
You know, maybe someday
we'll have another baby.
What do you think? Another baby?
A brother, a sister for little Nick?
Would you like
a little brother or sister?
Cally!
Stay the frak away from me!
I know what you are!
I know what all of you are.
How could you?
We don't even know what we are.
I heard you. You're Cylons!
- A bunch of frakkin'skinjobs.
- I wish it were that simple.
I told you to stay away from me.
I guess you better hope
there's a spare body waiting for you.
You want to kill me?
Go ahead.
Don't do this to yourself
or to your child.
- To Nicky.
- Get the frak away!
You're not getting your hands on my son!
Not you or not Galen!
- He frakkin' used me!
- He didn't know.
None of us did.
We didn't find out
until we entered that nebula.
Just shut the frak up, triggered!
All we know is that we're Cylons.
But in every other way,
- we're still the same people.
- You're frakkin' machines!
I don't know.
But I do know that we're not evil.
We're not inhuman.
And we're just as
scared and confused as you are.
I can't live like this!
It's a frakkin' nightmare.
You don't want to do this, Cally.
He's your son.
What have I done? I'm so sorry.
It's okay...
It's gonna be okay.
Let's just get out of here.
It's okay.
We'll work this out together.
It's okay.
Okay.
Here. Let me take him.
- =( Team Lords of Kobol )= -
<i>Previously on</i> Battlestar Galactica...
You'll be safe here, Gaius.
Please, God.
Don't let this child die.
God answered your prayers,
you have to see.
- Look at him.
- And no trace of a fever.
It's a miracle.
Tory, Tory...
Fancy finding you in the cafeteria.
- You have an abundance of feeling.
- I suppose I couldn't be a Cylon.
Cylons can feel.
- You believe that?
- Yeah, I do actually.
I want to explain.
- She sought us out.
- You know what has to be done here.
Now, it would be better for her sake
if it was you.
Let's say Cally does find out.
What do we do then?
The last thing we need
is for your Cylon-hating wife
to find out there's a bunch of skinjobs
running around this ship.
And that her husband is one of them.
- Cally!
- Stay the frak away from me!
I heard you. You're Cylons.
A bunch of frakking skinjobs.
I couldn't keep you safe from harm,
my love,
but I kept you in my heart.
You were the breath in my lungs,
the blood in my veins,
the light in my eye,
and now that breath is gone.
That blood
and the light are gone.
And I am left
a voice.
And the Lords of Kobol,
as many and as varied as mortal men,
must bend down and lean low
to hear that voice
and hear my lament.
With all our thoughts and love,
Calandra Henderson Tyrol,
we send your spirit into the universe.
So say we all.
So say we all.
I liked this service.
It's not for me, I'll tell you that.
I know, but I want you to know
what I like.
It was lovely.
Thank you.
Why do they have to do
these things at dawn?
It's all right.
They do because they have to.
I'm sorry.
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Thank you.
Sorry about your loss.
Sorry, Chief.
What the frak was that?
He'd get us all killed.
Chief.
I'm so sorry.
What's it up to today?
Same as... Sleeping, pacing.
Don't know how it doesn't go nuts.
Probably turns its brain off.
Frakkin' toaster.
Yeah.
Colonel.
Your request to see the child,
Hera Agathon, has been denied.
And you felt the need to come
all the way down here in person
to tell me that again?
You think I want to come down here?
We're done.
I think we're not.
You come every day.
<i>But you never ask questions anymore.</i>
Is there something
that you want from me?
Is there something that you need?
Stay back.
See you tomorrow, Colonel.
Door!
What was that at the service
this morning?
Why don't you get on the wireless
and tell the fleet about us?
Are you gonna deal with that kid?
Probably needs to be changed.
All right.
You think Cally killed herself
because of you, don't you?
She thought we were having an affair.
But we weren't.
I don't even know what I am anymore.
I don't know
which of my memories are real.
I don't know that I've had one action
in my life that isn't programmed.
Galen.
You're perfect.
You don't need guilt.
- We were made to be perfect.
- What is that?
More of Baltar's crap?
So...
You just...
live without guilt?
Just...
shut it down.
No.
That wasn't the deal.
Colonel, you said it yourself.
"Be the man you want to be
till the day you die."
- We're still the same people?
- Of course, we are.
- You shut up.
- That is not the same as human.
Like we're stronger,
right?
Chief,
what you're feeling is what a man feels
when this happens.
It's normal and it's human.
And it's not gonna end anytime soon.
It'll be there every day.
You'll see her every day.
You'll see her...
Be a man, Chief.
Feel what you gotta feel.
But don't risk us.
Come on, Tory.
Just think about it.
Think about what we are.
What we can do.

Dear Gods, what...?
Gods?
- Thought there was only one.
- What are you doing?
Pulling one hair
from your head at a time.
- It's intense, isn't it?
- Yeah.
If it happens at the same time
as a pleasurable touch...
Frak!
- Signals get crossed, don't they?
- Yeah.
It's hard to tell the pleasure
from the pain.
Yeah.
Listen, I think that...
You're very strong, aren't you?
You really...
I think I preferred it when you cried.
If you sin,
that God forgives you,
then it's gone, right? Erased?
Forgiveness.
You must consecrate the sin.
- Make it benign.
- Oh, yeah.
- Bad becomes good.
- Yes, it does.
Pain becomes pleasure.
And doesn't that mean,
if you really become one with God,
you can never do wrong?
Well, no,
not really, because that...
that would more than imply
we're all perfect.
Perfect?
Well, yeah.
- Perfect just as we are.
- No,
no, no, no!
Go, go, go.
You're all heretics!
Two minutes, go!
- Where is Gaius Baltar?
- He isn't here.
You, on your feet.
Find him.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
<i>Security alert.</i>
<i>- Deck 8, section 14.</i>
- One minute!
Down! Down! Down!
Everybody move down!
Go.
Where is Gaius...
We're coming back for Gaius Baltar.
Frak!
Finishing up, Chief?
Yeah. Just give me one more relay.
I think it's a boy.
Here you go, Chief.
Nice to be small, huh?
We ready to go?
I gotta get out of here.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
- Raptor away. Readings nominal.
- <i>Racetrack, Redwing.</i>
We been waiting
for that school bus of yours all day.
School bus?
What's that make those things?
Bicycles?
Racing cars, sweetheart.
<i>Top fuel racers.</i>
It's not gonna look very good
when they get beat by a school bus.
Okay, let's ride.
What the frak?
Galactica, Racetrack,
<i>I have no control
in my port rear lower RCS thruster.</i>
Skulls, get your ass up here.
Galactica, Racetrack, coming about.
Clear port landing deck
for emergency landing.
<i>Racetrack, Galactica,
dock cleared for emergency landing.</i>
One,
two,
<i>three,</i>
<i>four.</i>
One, two, three.
Coming in hot.
<i>Too hot!</i>
Where's the Admiral? Where is he?
And what are you doing, taking notes,
standing here. Mister Officious?
You should be out there, now, trying
to find the people, whoever they are!
Whatever you say, Sir.
You can read the old text,
can't you, Gaius?
Sons... of...
ar-is?
Ares. Sons of Ares. They're the people
who committed this attack.
Obviously,
a fundamentalist splinter group.
Although,
all they're doing is trying
to protect the old Gods.
Old Gods die hard.
Even among your people.
I've seen you here before, haven't I?
Your name is...
don't tell me...
begins with "M"...
- Lilly.
- Lilly.
What's in your hand, Lilly?
Asklepius.
God of healing.
I know you'll heal our people.
But I thought...
The old Gods are fighting back.
<i>- Where come on to do...</i>
- Those capacitors are still hot.
Watch yourself, Chief.
Take my glove.
Frak me.
My fault, didn't get swapped out.
We could have died.
- Was that in your pocket?
- We don't have to do this.
You're right,
we're okay.
It's okay.
Is it?
Skulls, is it?
- Galen.
- I don't need to be patted on the head.
- You can tell me I frakked up.
- Nobody got hurt, okay? Forget it.
- You're only human.
- No! Don't say that!
Tell me I frakked up!
Say it!
Tell me I frakked up!
Any one of you.
Cowards!
Chief, I can handle this.
Why don't you take a little down time?
Get out of the Raptor, Figurski.
People have room in their hearts
for one great belief,
you or the old Gods.
Which one will it be?
Why can't I just be a man?
Do I really need to take
on the Gods single-handed?
No. But imagine the kind of man
you'll be when you do.
Surely such a man must be magnificent,
larger-than-life, godlike himself.
What are you talking about?
It's not about that at all.
It's about this.
Stop!
Stop.
This is unacceptable.
We have been targeted
because of what we believe.
By those who answer to faceless Gods
that bear no relevance in our world.
They want us to be afraid.
And I'm tired of being afraid.
The time has come to make a stand.
And that time is now.
Gaius, what are you doing?
Where are you going?
Gaius?
We want justice,
not looking at stupid old Gods!
Sir, we're having a service.
Are you?
But whom are you serving?
- I have to ask you to leave.
- Do you?
Would you be serving Zeus?
Apparently, king of the Gods,
who also happened to be,
let me tell you, a serial rapist.
Prone to giving birth out
of his own forehead.
That's very likely, isn't it?
Well, Gods strike me down.
- What are you going to do?
- Damn you.
You ignorant witch,
telling the people lies and stories.
Maybe you want me
to pray to Asklepius,
who healed wounds
with the blood of Gorgons,
or Aphrodite or Artemis
or any other of this rubbish!
How awful!
Out of the way, you hideous old witch.
That's the kind of rubbish
that you made!
I will not be destroyed at this level!
God!
Haven't enough of us died already?
Am I that late?
No, this wasn't a treatment.
It was just a blood test.
- You brought a new book?
- Yes. Something different this time.
It's a classic. My favorite.
<i>Searider Falcon</i>,
I haven't read it in years.
I don't remember how it ends.
I don't either. I never read the ending.
- You're kidding. It's your favorite.
- I like it so much,
I don't want it to be over.
- So I'm saving it.
- Maybe I should do that.
That's a bad idea. Maybe not.
Let me do that for you.
Okay, thanks.
Baltar's back at home in the brig again.
Desecration of a temple.
It's his revenge for what happened
to him this morning.
It was brutal.
I have my personnel trying to track down
anything on the Sons of Ares.
- But nobody's talking.
- The thing is that Baltar knows
that there are religious hardliners
in Dogsville,
but he continues to provoke.
I just can't have
a religious war in this fleet.
Oh, please, no.
The whole damn thing'll become
our frakkin' responsibility,
yours and mine. Seriously, Bill,
we have 30,000 people left
and they're not happy
unless they're kicking
each other's teeth in.
- This is what we've become?
- No.
It's him.
Baltar has an uncanny way of
stirring up all the crap.
I wonder if he'd be willing
to stay in lockdown,
indefinitely, for his own safety.
And make a martyr out of him? No way.
Those girly, groupie,
sex whatever-they-are,
they already think he's a god.
- So we kick him off of the Galactica.
- No, I want him close.
I'm going to the brig.
You want to see him?
I want him to see me.
Oh, we didn't even make it
to tomorrow, did we?
You asked what I want.
I want to know how it feels
to have killed billions of human beings,
to have all that blood on your hands.
Think it through.
Because that's what I want.
I feel it.
Do you really think that I couldn't?
Do you?
Or do you turn it off?
Is there a switch in your head
that you turn off?
You talk like we're different,
but you know we're not.
Weapons.
Working late, or up early, Chief?
You act like you think
I'm made of switches and relays.
Look...
veins, not wires.
We're the same.
Do you see we're the same?
Then tell me.
Tell you what?
How you live with what you've done.
Saul,
are you asking for absolution?
Forgiveness?
I can give you that.
Stand down.
Step outside.
Just tell me what the trouble is.
You have nothing to offer me.
We're not the same.
Were you asleep?
What is it this time?
Here to strip-search me?
Or could it possibly be
that your presence here means
that the President has been made
aware of my situation.
It's being looked into.
- Is it really?
- Aggressively.
Now here's the thing.
I want you to look at me, Gaius.
Just look at me.
This is a wig.
I'm dying.
Now, if you look in my eyes...
Go ahead, look.
You can probably see it.
- I'm very sorry.
- No, I don't want your pity.
I'm still doing my job. In fact,
I'm gonna aggressively pursue
the men that attacked you.
And I'm going to limit the size
of public assemblies
to protect your people, but...
I'm going to be slipping away
from this life very soon,
and I've gotten kind of curious
as to what that's going to be like,
and so, I did some research.
There are some people who say
that when people are getting closer
to their death, they just don't care
as much about rules and laws and...
conventional morality.
Are you threatening me?
No, no,
I'm just saying "have a quiet life".
And I'll die a quiet little death.
And everyone will be happy.
It's just that I'm not in the mood
any longer to indulge you.
And that's...
all.
And you are
being released, so...
stay safe.
Hey, Chief.
We all miss her, Chief.
I understand if you need some time off.
Or even if you might need more shifts
to keep yourself busy.
No one knows how they're going to react
to loss like this,
or what they're gonna need.
I don't need special treatment.
I guess she just couldn't take it, huh?
Being married to a Cylon?
Being the mother
of a half-breed abomination?
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
She was a good woman.
If you really believe that,
you wouldn't have threatened to stick
her up against a bulkhead and shoot her.
It's okay, though.
I thought about doing it
many times myself. Believe me.
- Chief...
- How many of us ended up
with the people
we really wanted to be with?
Got stuck
with the best of limited options?
And why?
Because the ones we really want,
the really loved, were dead
dying,
turned out to be Cylons
and they didn't know. If Boomer had...
- if I had known...
- Listen, let's...
- No.
- Let's go. Come on.
No.
I didn't know.
- Let's go.
- I didn't know.
So I buried my head in the sand
and I took it and I settled!
I settled for that shriek,
those dull vacant eyes,
the boiled cabbage stench of her.
And why?
Because this is my life!
This is the life I picked.
And it's fine,
but you know what? It's not.
I didn't pick this life.
This is not my frakkin' life.
What the hell's gotten into you?
Don't do this.
Don't do this to her memory.
You know what?
I'm sorry if I'm not gonna do this
the way you want me to,
or the way you might.
But I will not make an angel
out of someone who wasn't an angel.
But I can see you have.
And now you've come down here
to be in my club,
but you're not in my club.
You don't know what frakkin' club I'm in
'cause you never asked
the right questions.
Chief, let's get out of here.
No.
Why don't you go?
- Take care of your precious ship.
- Stop it.
Stop all of this.
If you don't, I'm gonna have
to act on it. Shut up.
Great!
Do it!
Please! For the love of Gods,
please demote me.
Get me off your frakkin' ship!
Specialist Tyrol,
I want you off my hangar deck
before you endanger another pilot.
You're to report to Petty Officer Bassom
tomorrow morning at 0600
for reassignment.
Do you understand?
You have authority
over emergency measures,
but you bulldozed this through
after the session was closed.
Yes, exactly.
It's a crowd control measure.
I also authorized the repair
of a cargo elevator,
do you want to talk about that too?
Crowd control? Looks to me
like it was designed purely to stop
- Gaius Baltar's organization.
- You mean his cult?
Well his "cult" was attacked.
And from what I'm hearing
around the fleet,
- it was pretty brutal.
- It was brutal.
Exactly.
And this measure is designed explicitly
to protect those people.
If they aren't gathering in mass,
they aren't provoking resentment.
It limits his group, while permitting
more mainstream worship.
Wherever Gaius Baltar is,
violence happens.
And if he doesn't cause it, he draws it.
My job, Mr. Adama,
is, and always will be,
to keep the people safe.
Madame President,
I have to wonder if this resolution
couldn't be used
against other offshoot religious groups.
Absolutely not.
Gaius Baltar is a special case.
You know that.
And we're making him a special case.
- How are we doing that?
- We're fueling his argument.
After all, is he preaching violence?
Immoral acts?
I don't know.
I haven't been to one of his...
- What are they called? Services?
- It's not that far
from what some of our own
Mithras followers believe.
We have Mithrasaries among the Gemenese.
Can this order be applied to them?
Clear your heads.
We are talking about Gaius Baltar.
Everyone in this room experienced
tragedy at New Caprica.
Have we forgotten?
Will you open this order
to a full Quorum vote?
No.
We can override, Madam President.
I cannot let this stand.
You can override, and you cannot
let this stand, Mr. Adama?
Then you open it up to a vote.
And if you strike this down,
you can all go back
to your constituents
and you can tell them what you've done,
and "we, the people,"
will have triumphed.
But think about
what it's gonna cost you.
Because every single one of you
remembers
what it was like
when Gaius Baltar had political power.
And you should be terrified
to think about what this man will do
with blind religious devotion.
So go ahead.
Vote.
Should I get used to waking up
to this face?
You're traveling light.
An informal chat.
Just you and me.
<i>And the man watching
through the cameras.</i>
You haven't answered my question.
You want to know how I work?
If I can turn off pain?
Can you?
I want the pain.
It's how I learn.
I was instrumental
in the destruction of humanity.
But at the same time,
I learned because...
because I fell in love.
With a human man.
And he was mortal.
And fallible.
And he had this incredible
pride in himself.
He thought he knew everything
there was to know.
And I loved him
with my whole heart.
And then one day,
I realized
I wouldn't have him forever.
I understood what I'd done.
How I betrayed him and humanity.
And that pain
taught me to understand death.
Baltar could die.
- And I loved him.
- No.
- Baltar's heart was ephemeral.
- No.
Baltar's body was fragile in my hands.
No, we are not gonna talk
about the fragile body
of Gaius frakkin' Baltar! Door!
Door!
Dismissed. Clear out, out!
Frak, what's he gonna do to her?
- I can tell you how to turn it off.
- How?
Pain is how I learn from the guilt.
There's wisdom there.
Clarity. You know yourself there.
Pain.
Our minds
were designed based on your minds.
We learn things about how you work
that you've never known.
When you're in pain,
that's when you learn
who you really are.
That's when you focus,
sharp as the point of a knife.
I can give you that clarity again.
I'm sorry, Sir,
I'm not supposed to let you enter.
What are you doing?
There are 12 people inside already.
- You can count?
- Yes, Sir.
You can't enter without breaking
emergency provision 1-7.
- If I leave, he can come in.
- If she leaves, I can come in.
Everyone stay inside for safety reasons.
- This is absurd. You're counting heads.
- I have my orders.
But I live here,
and so do some of these women.
Where are we supposed to go?
This is your moment, Gaius.
Step forward. Make a stand.
I don't want to be a hero.
- I just want to go to bed. Go to sleep.
- Look at me.
I promise you.
Step forward, and you will not be hurt.
- Promise to me?
- Yes,
you can lie down inside. Go in.
Stop, Sir.
Gaius!
Get your damn' hands off me,
you frakkin' freak machine!
Can you feel it, Saul?
Can you feel the clarity of it?
Stay down or clear this area, Sir!
You have to do this.
The gain will outweigh the cost.
I really want to stay down.
No, you don't.
- Stay down, please, Sir!
- Wait, wait, stop!
- Lieutenant.
- Stand down.
The Quorum has just met
in an emergency session.
Full right of assembly
has been restored.
You can...
you can go back into your home.
No one will stop you.
Thank you.
I don't do these things for you.
You do them
because your God compels you.
Lee has no idea.
He really has no idea.
Have you heard anything I said?
There are pragmatic realities
he refuses to face.
Well, that's a problem, of course.
He's doing what he thinks is right.
Well, yeah, he's Lee.
Thing is,
it probably is the right thing, but...
sometimes the right thing is a luxury.
And it can have
profoundly dangerous consequences.
And yet it's almost
as if he doesn't want that to be true.
Okay, I gotta stop this.
I'm not supposed to...
get upset during treatment.
Will you read the next chapter?
I must warn you that I'm getting
into the part that I haven't read yet.
Oh dear.
Are you going to be able to continue?
Chapter seven:
"The raft was not as seaworthy
as I had hoped.
"The waves repeatedly
threatened to swamp it.
"I wasn't afraid to die.
"I was afraid of the emptiness
that I felt inside.
"I couldn't feel anything.
"That's what scared me.
"It came into my thoughts.
"It filled them.
"It felt good."
More.
No.
Keep going.
No, I made a mistake.
This isn't what you need.
I'm not a priest.
I've never even been
a particularly good man.
I have, in fact,
been a profoundly
selfish man.
But that doesn't matter, you see.
Something in the universe
loves me.
Something in the universe
loves the entity that is me.
I will choose to call this something
"God."
A singular spark
that dwells
in the soul of every living being.
If you look inside yourself,
you will find this spark too.
You will.
But you have to look.
Deep.
Love your faults.
Embrace them.
If God embraces them,
then how can they be faults?
Love yourself.
You have to love yourself.
If we don't love ourselves,
how can we love others?
And when we know what we are,
then we can find
the truth out about others.
See what they are.
The truth about them.
And you know what the truth is,
the truth about them.
About you.
About me.
Do you?
The truth is we are all perfect,
just as we are.
God only loves that which is perfect,
and he loves you.
He loves you because you are perfect.
You are perfect...
just as you are.

<i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
Helo handpicked a crew for you.
I'm giving you a ship.
We liberated the Demetrius.
A sewage recycling ship.
Now go.
Find a way to Earth.
I'm telling you, guys,
this thing is a setup anyway.
You think  the old man
just gave her the ship
and then cut her loose?
That's enough of that crap.
The resurrection ship
didn't make the jump.
And now Cavil's baseships
are breaking formation,
- taking positions around our periphery.
- They're going to attack.
They've taken out our FTL!
No resurrection ship.
They're really trying to kill us.
Stay the frak away from me!
I heard you. You're Cylons!
A bunch of frakkin' skinjobs.
You think Cally killed herself
because of you, don't you?
- She thought we were having an affair.
- But we weren't.
No, that's right.
I'm not a cheater, I'm a Cylon.
I'm not a priest.
But that doesn't matter, you see.
Something in the universe...
loves me.
God only loves that which is perfect,
and he loves you.
He loves you because you are perfect
just as you are.
Captain.
Captain!
I'm glad you're here.
I might have found something.
Before that, we need to talk
about making our <i>rendezvous</i>
with the fleet.
Later.
Come on.
Here.
What do you think?
Well...
It's hard to say.
Spectroscopics are promising.
But according to this, we already did
two long-range recons of that grid.
Both no joy.
Third time's the charm maybe.
All right,
I'll have Sharon prep to go
as soon as Anders
gets back from his scout.
What about you?
You been getting any sleep?
I don't know. Not much.
It was so clear when I first got back.
If I could...
if I could just focus,
I know that I can find that sound again.
I gotta go see the CAP off.
We'll talk when I get back.
Hold up.
I think I'll go with you on this one.
You haven't flown a CAP
since we left the fleet.
I think I'll go with you on this one.
I need you to tell me
that all this somehow makes sense.
This was my husband, James.
My two children, Danya
and Reece.
They were on Picon
when the Cylons attacked.
What do you feel
when you look at this photograph?
I feel rage.
Against the Cylons.
Not just the machines.
Anyone involved.
The engineers who designed them.
The corporations,
the politicians
who provoked this war
and then did nothing to protect us.
And most of all the Gods.
The Gods.
They stood by and let it all happen.
Yes, I know.
I know.
I am so sorry, Phoebe.
I sympathize.
Unfortunately, the Gods cannot be blamed
for not coming to your aid.
It's not because they weren't listening.
It's because they don't exist.
The Gods we've been praying to
for thousands of years do not exist.
They can't help you
because they are not real.
We have been pandering
to our own ignorance
for far too long.
<i>Now on my own journey,</i>
<i>I've been wronged,</i>
<i>persecuted.</i>
<i>I prayed to the Gods</i>
<i>on my knees</i>
<i>begging them for mercy.</i>
<i>Tortured.</i>
<i>I received nothing in resp...</i>
<i>I could've lived</i>
<i>in that abyss of bitterness,</i>
<i>but that will destroy you
like nothing else.</i>
<i>But I chose to forgive.</i>
<i>And most importantly,
I began with myself.</i>
"Third time's the charm?"
And you just went along with it?
It's called following orders,
Lieutenant.
It's called dragging our feet.
Starbuck's pushing our go back deadline
to the last second.
She's afraid of what Adama's gonna say
when he realizes her vision
was just a pipe dream.
- You've got to be kidding me.
- She's taking a Viper out now?
She can't be serious.
Maybe she could do
a little finger painting...
I've heard enough bitching and moaning
to last a lifetime.
Two more days
and we're back with the fleet, okay?
Until then, everyone just shut up
and do your jobs.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Starbuck, Hot Dog. Didn't catch that.
What are your orders?
Hot Dog, Demetrius. You know the drill.
Keep your eyes open
and stick close to Starbuck's wing.
I know you're out here somewhere.
<i>Come on.</i>
Starbuck, dradis contact.
<i>Demetrius, we've got an inbound.
One bogey bearing 1-4-9er.</i>
Roger that.
Call action stations.
Spool up the FTL for emergency jump.
<i>Action stations, action stations.
Set condition one throughout the ship.</i>
<i>This is not a drill.
Repeat, action stations.</i>
<i>This is not a drill.</i>
Son of a bitch, I knew it.
<i>Demetrius, Hot Dog. I've got visual.</i>
<i>Cylon heavy Raider.</i>
Starbuck, Demetrius. Report.
Report!
<i>Demetrius, I'm seeing blast damage</i>
<i>all over this thing.</i>
<i>Starbuck, what are your orders?</i>
Come on.
Talk to me, shoot me, do something.
<i>Starbuck, what are your orders?</i>
Frak!
<i>Kara.</i>
<i>I'm alone.</i>
<i>It's not an attack.</i>
<i>I knew I'd find you.</i>
<i>Knew you'd be out here searching.</i>
Leoben?
<i>I'm here for you,
to offer a truce between Cylon</i>
<i>and human.</i>
<i>And a chance for you
to complete your journey.</i>

Heavy Raider's docked
at the aft airlock.
The animal part
that controls it looks dead.
We only found the one Leoben onboard.
Starbuck is still taking
one hell of a chance.
If he wanted to kill us,
we'd all be dead by now.
Just means he wants something else.
Kara.
Thank you for this.
We were praying for a miracle.
It wasn't a miracle.
It's like I knew you were out there.
I'm not picking up
any gamma emissions, Sir.
Raider's packing conventional
weaponry only. No nukes.
All right.
Keep checking for tracking devices.
Anything that might
give up our position.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm sorry.
The difference between the way
you were on New Caprica
- and now is...
- I'm the same person.
I have eyes. I can see.
God has taken your hand
and purged you
of the questions, the doubt.
Your journey can finally begin.
But there isn't much time.
The others, the ones I left behind,
they need your help.
But not as much as you need theirs.
Why?
Your crew.
They don't trust you.
I need you to tell me why you're here...
Captain, we should move the prisoner.
A blue planet
surrounded by clouds.
Stop!
The hybrid.
When she first described it to me,
how beautiful it was,
I cried.
You need
to go to her, Kara.
The hybrid,
she'll tell you things. Amazing things.
We're done here. Get him out of here.
Wait!
Take him to my quarters.
Just do it!
It may never make any sense.
Hangar deck crew tells me
you've been obsessing over this place.
Going over the logs.
Replaying the accident again and again.
Accident.
What is it?
I spoke to Cottle.
Cally was on
Moxopan and Cosapine.
Antidepressants.
How did she go
from antidepressants to suicide?
Well, she was...
emotionally disturbed.
She would've left me.
She never would've left Nicky behind.
So...
what do you think then?
Someone killed her?
Galen, you have to let it go.
No, I gotta figure out what happened.
What if she knew?
How would she have known?
Maybe she sensed it.
I mean, she was your wife.
You've been
different
since the Nebula.
Maybe she was afraid of you.
Maybe it was God's will.
We don't know why these things happen.
But God does.
And he has a plan for us.
For whatever reason,
her death, our awakening,
you gotta trust
that it's all for the best.
Why are you here?
Because we are in this together.
And I am here for you,
Galen.
I know exactly where you are right now.
I have been there.
Until Gaius helped me realize that...
what...
whatever has gone before,
whatever I have done, it doesn't matter.
We can still change.
You spend way too much time with Baltar.
So I guess I missed
all the excitement, huh?
So what's the deal?
This Leoben, has he said anything?
Don't know.
Starbuck ordered the guards
to wait outside, lose the cuffs.
Said she didn't want to be disturbed.
- Guess I'll talk to her.
- Yeah, why don't you do that?
Hey.
- Get the hell away from her.
- Sam... Sam, stop it!
What is wrong with you, Kara?
- I can see why she's so fond of you.
- Just leave him alone.
You know... you know what we have to do.
- Just remember there isn't much time.
- Get him the frak out of here!
Cuff him and lock him in storage!
What is going on with you?
Kara!
He can help us.
The Cylons, they understand about Earth.
And you believe him?
After everything he's done to you?
Kara, he kept you locked up
for months on New Caprica.
The frakkin' mind games.
I swear to Gods
this is not a dream.
It's real.
I'm glad you're here.
You and Kara,
did you get things worked out?
Because you should.
You weren't meant to be
enemies.
No. That'd be you and me.
What do you want from Kara?
The same thing I've always wanted.
For her to understand her destiny.
- That's not good enough.
- It's good enough for her.
What is the most basic article of faith?
That this is not all that we are.
C-Bucks rule.
- What did you just say?
- Forward guard, right?
I saw a couple games. You were good.
Yet after all the celebrity and acclaim,
what were you?
Just another face selling magazines.
Another piece of scoreboard trivia,
and you always knew
you were destined for more.
You were just waiting
for your singular moment of clarity.
Well, maybe I just found it.
You kill me, Kara's dream dies with me.
I don't think so.
I think you download
into another Leoben body
and you spew more lies.
No one's coming back.
We were lured out of resurrection range.
Ship was attacked. We survived.
The baseship was damaged.
We were set adrift.
What are you talking about?
Who attacked you?
War has broken out between the Cylon.
Battle lines have been drawn
between those who embrace their nature
and those who fear it.
Good.
You can blow yourselves to hell
for all I care.
That's one way.
There's another.
An alliance.
Allow our paths to converge.
You save us from our savage brothers.
And our old one, the hybrid,
will show Kara the righteous path.
And together,
they'll lead us to the promised land.
Together, we will find Earth.
He said his baseship was attacked;
that they were ambushed
by their own kind.
So now the Cylons
want us to rescue them.
That's novel.
Well, he's proposing an alliance
between us and his damaged baseship.
How's that supposed to work?
Yeah, are we supposed to let them
piggyback on our nav and FTL systems
and help them jump out of harm's way?
They'll join forces with the fleet.
Right.
If... it's true.
Frak.
- Are you thinking about doing this?
- XO, listen.
Bringing Leoben on board,
that was questionable at best.
But jumping back to his baseship?
It's suicide.
Nothing's been decided.
And what, you trust Starbuck
to make the right decision?
- Because she's out of control.
- What are you saying?
We are running on fumes, Anders.
In two days, we are gonna be overdue
for our <i>rendezvous </i>with the fleet.
We gotta do something
before she takes us all down with her.
Are you talking mutiny?
'Cause that's sure what it sounds like.
You want to tear this ship apart,
then keep riling up the crew
making your crazy Starbuck cracks.
Otherwise, I suggest
you both shut the frak up.
Starbuck is leading us into a trap.
Cylons are gonna capture the freighter.
They're gonna have nav data
leading straight back to the fleet.
Then we better keep that from happening.
Order the CAP back
and lock down the ship.
As soon we can work through the jump
coordinates from Leoben's Raider, we go.
It's a chance to find Earth!
I intend to take it.
Not that I particularly care,
but since I haven't been arrested
recently or beaten up, can I...
can I surmise that the President
has not been apprised
of my pirate broadcasts?
Actually, I told her all about them.
I even suggested
she speak to the Admiral.
Really.
I guess you'll have to do
something about that.
Or not.
Even Roslin and Adama must realize
the movement's taken on
a life of its own.
It's gonna take them more than
bashing in a few heads to stop this.
The truth is you're not worth
another confrontation in the Quorum.
You may be drawing
more bodies to your crusade,
but they're from the fringes.
No one of consequence.
Get some clothes on.
They're waiting for you.
Think we have enough?
It doesn't matter.
They're not coming to be fed.
They're coming to hear
Dr. Baltar's word,
and learn from it, just like we did.
The past is written.
Impossible to change.
Why are so many of us
living in the past?
Living with the shame
of what we have done.
<i>When we could live</i>
<i>in awe of what we might do.</i>
<i>What we might do.</i>
<i>What will we do?</i>
<i>Spiral endlessly through the heavens</i>
until humanity itself comes to a close?
<i>Or do we look inward...</i>
<i>and find that strength within?</i>
Can you believe these people
are actually buying into Baltar's crap?
<i>We have the opportunity...</i>
We need to talk.
I don't have anything to say to you.
Well, then you can listen.
Come with me.
I've been cutting you some slack
because of Cally, but that's over.
You gotta pull yourself together now.
Suck it up.
Just like you, huh?
Now what is that supposed to mean?
I hear you've been spending some time
in the lockup with the Six.
Remember when this all started?
You said nothing would change you
from the man you want to be.
How about it, Colonel?
You still the same old Saul Tigh?
Anything I've done
I can live with.
That's the difference
between you and me.
I can't.
Tory's got in her head that we can be
the salvation of the human race.
All I know is if there is a God,
he's laughing his ass off.
EVA is almost complete, Captain.
<i>Demetrius, Mathias.</i>
I've finished inspection
of the aft section.
She's a big sucker.
Okay, wrap it up, Sarge.
Get back to the nest asap.
<i>Roger that, Athena.</i>
I was getting bored
with the view anyhow.
Hold up.
Got a leak.
Some kind of
gas venting through a crack in the hull.
Something's happening.
Mathias, report.
Mathias, report!
Please.
Please don't clap.
What are you all doing here?
The reason that we are all here
is 'cause the old ways have failed us.
It doesn't matter if you're a believer
or a nonbeliever.
It certainly makes no difference to me.
You are all welcome.
Mr. Tyrol.
Mr. Tyrol!
I know that we have had our differences,
but I am begging you right now
to set those aside.
Come down here and take my hand.
If not for yourself, then for your wife.
For Cally.
She would've wanted this.
Cally wasn't like me.
She forgave you for New Caprica.
Even read your bogus manifesto,
but not me.
You may have your sheep fooled.
They may be buying
into your message of forgiveness.
But let me tell you. There are some sins
that even your imaginary god
can never forgive.
I have not been talking
about an imaginary god.
I am asking you to take my hand.
Take my hand, Mr. Tyrol.
For Cally.
It's what she would've wanted.
Get off of him!
Leave him!
Leave him!
You didn't know her!
I heard an explosion.
You all right?
What'd you do?
Blow the tylium stores?
- That's the Kara I used to know.
- The Raider's in pieces mother-frakker!
Sergeant Mathias is dead.
Not that you give a damn!
You can't think
that I had anything to do with that.
I wasn't even on the deck.
I was too busy believing you
instead of watching out for my crew.
My ship was under fire.
The reactor could've been damaged.
It was a setup.
Say it!
Hit me again.
You used me to get close to the ship.
How many times did you kill me
on New Caprica? Don't stop now.
- Frak you.
- Go on, do it.
I won't come back this time, I promise.
Resurrection ship's well out of range.
Go on, do it.
Do it!
It doesn't help...
does it?
Nothing feels quite like
it did before...
does it?
What are you doing to me?
All of your life...
you forced back the truth
by lashing out at everyone around you.
Anesthetizing yourself
with ambrosia and empty affairs.
But you've lost the taste
for those petty things.
- I'm the same person.
- No,
an emptiness that can only be filled
by taking the next step on your journey.
What happened to me
the two months I was missing?
- I don't know.
- The mandala,
the paintings, my mother.
- It had to mean something.
- You have to make peace with your past.
Why?
Because that part of you is gone.
I told you when I arrived
that you had changed.
I don't see Kara Thrace. I see...
an angel blazing with the light of God.
An angel eager to lead her people home.
This is bad. This is really bad.
- She can't explain this one away.
- So you think she's a Cylon now?
Starbuck's racked up more kills
than any pilot in the fleet.
Yeah, Starbuck maybe.
Okay, but who the hell knows
who got off that Viper two months ago?
I'm not really very good at any of this.
We've all come
to remember Sergeant Erin Mathias.
To grieve for our loss. To honor her.
Mathias is dead because of me.
We've all heard the words, the prayers,
but I don't know
what any of it means anymore.
We want to believe
that she died for something.
But in this war,
people die and it is just stupid.
It's an accident.
There's no nobility to it.
There's nothing we can grab onto
that's gonna make it any easier.
They're just gone.
I have to live with that.
You know, I know...
that this has been a difficult mission.
And...
maybe I haven't...
Captain, we've downloaded
the <i>rendezvous </i>coordinates to the FTL.
We're ready to jump back to the fleet
on your order.
We're not going back to the fleet.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- We came here to complete a mission.
That baseship
has something to do with it, I know it.
Captain Agathon.
Lock down the ship.
Prepare to jump.
No, you know what? Frak her
and frak her little pet Cylon, okay?
This baseship
was never part of the mission.
Okay, one of us is dead now.
One of us is dead,
and if we don't leave right now
we are all going to die, all right?
Just let it go!
If I don't do anything,
we're all gonna die!
- Get out of my way!
- You have your orders, back off!
You better choose
which side you're on, Captain.
Walk away
and this doesn't go any further!
You'd be the one
who protect that Cylon thing, right?
I don't understand what you're trying
to accomplish. He is psychotic.
My message is for everyone. Especially
the ones who don't want to listen.
- I don't think it's safe.
- 5 minutes, that's all.
Mr. Tyrol.
- Gaius, I really don't think...
- There's nothing to be afraid of.
Be careful.
Look, uh, Chief, I...
I'm here to ask for your forgiveness.
About my presumption earlier.
You were right, you know.
I hardly knew your wife.
I'm sorry.
Would you mind if I...
just...
I know it's hard to...
make sense of things sometimes.
In my own life...
In my own life,
I joined the fleet as a scientist,
as a skeptic,
as supposedly a man of reason.
Only to have fate
turn that all on its head.
But I understand now
that there is a purpose to it.
We change.
We evolve.
Maybe we even learn something
along the way.
I have committed...
unconscionable crimes.
And I have been offered
one last chance at redemption.
Because I chose to accept my fate,
not fight it anymore.
I'm so sorry for your loss, Chief.
She was a very beautiful woman,
your wife.
I'm also told quite spiritual.
You know,
I don't expect you to believe me, but...
I would very much like
to have known her better.
Thank you.
<i>Action stations, action stations.</i>
<i>Set condition one throughout the ship.</i>
Are you really gonna do this?
I don't have any choice.
Yes, you do.
FTL's spooled, Captain.
Good.
Set the clock.
Captain.
Captain, I'm asking you to reconsider.
There's not enough time.
We don't go now, we lose our shot.
That's assuming we believe the Cylon,
and that Leoben's coordinates are right.
We don't jump into a nest of baseships
or in a star...
Galactica's standing orders are clear.
If we miss the <i>rendezvous</i>, Adama
will assume we're dead or captured.
- They will leave us.
- No.
- Not adama.
- Listen to me,
we can jump back to Galactica.
If the Admiral's for it, we can
re-supply. Send out an armed patrol.
Do not do this, Helo.
I can't allow you
to risk the lives of this ship's crew.
When the admiral put me in command,
he told me to trust my instincts.
Find the next marker,
see if it checks out.
Lead the people from the fleet home.
That is what I intend to do.
Now... prepare to jump!
I'm sorry, Sir,
but I cannot obey that order.
Then you are relieved, Captain.
Mr. Gaeta, you are now the new XO.
Prepare to jump on my mark.
No, Sir.
Okay, everybody needs
to think about what they're doing here.
They have thought about it, Sam.
They all have.
It's a mutiny.
Captain Thrace,
as XO of the Demetrius,
and acting under article ten
of the colonial military code,
I'm hereby relieving you of command.

<i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
Madame President,
are you taking Chamalla again?
I am taking Chamalla again
because my cancer has returned.
I remember a flashing triple star,
a giant gas planet with rings,
and a comet.
What's the latest, Felix?
She's reversing course.
Returning to sector seven.
- That is the tenth course correction.
- Frak me.
They're going to attack.
Alert the others.
We need to jump now.
Just remember,
- <i>they </i>started it.
- But we're killing them.
We are truly killing them.
Dradis contact.
I've got visual. Cylon heavy Raider.
<i>Kara, I'm alone. This is not an attack.</i>
- <i>I knew I'd find you.</i>
- Leoben.
<i>I'm here for you.</i>
<i>To offer a truce between human and Cylon</i>
<i>and a chance for you
to complete your journey.</i>
The Hybrid.
You need to go to her, Kara.
She'll tell you the way to get to Earth.
We're done here. Get him out of here.
This baseship was never
part of the mission.
If we don't leave right now,
we are all going to die.
We're ready to jump back on your order.
- We're not going back to the fleet.
- What are you talking about?
We came to complete a mission,
that baseship has
something to do with it.
Captain Thrace, as XO of the Demetrius,
I'm hereby relieving you of command.
You son of a bitch.
I'll do it myself.
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Stand down!
Order the marine guards
to the control room.
Tell them I'm placing
Captain Thrace under arrest.
You're wrong, Helo.
You're so godsdamn wrong.
Either way, we're taking Leoben
and his proposal back to the fleet.
The Admiral will sort it out.
You're throwing away
our last chance to find Earth.
And you'll be going back
to Galactica as mutineers.
How do you think
the Admiral's gonna sort through that?
That's up to him.
M. Gaeta, reset the FTL
for the first jump back to the fleet.
Right away, Sir.
- We should just airlock your Cylon ass.
- I am not a Cylon.
Gaeta, stop!
Gaeta, abort the jump!
I said, abort the jump!
Frak.
You want to know who's in charge?
Who's in command?
- You frakkin' want to know?!
- Sam!
It's Captain Thrace, Gods damn it!
Now let her go!
Sergeant, stand down.
- Stand down, Sergeant!
- Medic!
Stand down, Sergeant! That's an order!
Seelix, stand down! Stand down.
What the frak?
- I need a med kit!
- Stay away from me.
Frak!
What the frak?
All right, bloodstopper.
This is gonna hurt.
Ready, go.
Get off me, you frakkin' bitch...
Morpha.
We need to move him to a bunk.
- Marines, get over here!
- Yes, Sir.
- Easy.
- Careful!
Wait, listen. Kara, that was...
So now what?
Gonna give orders at gunpoint?
You're right, Helo.
I never should've ordered Demetrius
to jump to the baseship.
Too many lives to risk
on a gut instinct.
- So Demetrius goes back to the fleet.
- Missing a Raptor.
I'm gonna take Leoben to the baseship,
see if his story checks out.
Are you insane? The two of you alone?
She's not going alone.
I'm going with her.
This is crazy, but I need you.
What?
I need someone speaking their language.
If this is a trap,
I want to know about it.
Hell, yeah, let the Cylon go.
It's okay.
I'll do it.
Listen to me. Your Raptor doesn't have
enough fuel to get back to Galactica.
But the baseship does.
We were sent out here by the Admiral
to complete a mission.
Not for me,
but for the people of the fleet.
And if I'm right, the payoff is Earth.
Lieutenant Costanza,
what's the latest we can leave here
and still make the rendezvous
with the fleet?
Window closes
15 hours and seven minutes.
And that's cutting it really damn close.
Set the clock to 15 hours
and 7 minutes and start it.
We'll be waiting here
till the clock runs out.

So I guess just pack up
everything that's here.
Pack up all of these drafts.
I will have plenty of time on my hands
over the next couple of days,
so pack it up.
At least the worst is over.
2 more Doloxan treatments
and you will be over the hump.
And I'm gonna need you to...
Really keep an eye on things until then.
Don't worry.
I'll make sure our friend from Picon
sees the error of his ways.
I'm not just talking
about the Quorum, Tory.
There was a time a few months ago
when you seemed overwhelmed
by the stresses and the pressures
of this job.
But lately you've really stepped up.
And I'm gonna be demanding
even more of that from you
in the days to come, because...
I'm not quite sure
of what I'm doing right.
I'm sort of...
I'm just gonna need you
to keep a keen eye
on every single thing
that comes across this desk.
I appreciate your confidence,
Madame President.
Thank you. Let's go.
Just remember, if this is a trap,
you die first.
Preflight is complete.
I need to know.
Do I need to watch my back
with you on this?
No, I said I'd go.
You have my word.
Be like a homecoming for you.
The other Eights talk
about you all the time.
Keep him the frak away from me.
Barolay, I didn't ask for volunteers.
Yeah, you did, back on Galactica.
I don't give a frak what they think.
You've been kicking ass since day one.
You say you can find Earth.
I wanna be there when you do.
You have 14 hours and 40 minutes.
- Godspeed.
- Copy that.
Can you feel it?
The anticipation.
God's plan is about to be revealed.
You better hope so for your sake.
Three, two, one, jump.
Multiple contacts, all quadrants.
Looks like we found what's left of them.
How you doing, Felix?
Never better.
Those frakkers
won't give me any more morpha.
Afraid I'll OD or something.
Yeah, I know.
Will you promise me something?
Anything.
Don't let Cottle take my leg.
- You're gonna be all right.
- Don't frak with me.
Karl.
I know every minute that we stay here
means it's more likely
that he's gonna have to.
Please.
Okay, promise me.
Felix,
you know damn well
I won't leave until the clock runs out.
All right, where's the baseship?
Don't know. If it's still in one piece,
dradis is too cluttered to see it.
Watch yourselves. We've got ordinance
popping off all over the place.
Looks like he wasn't lying
about a civil war.
This is it.
This is the place.
I can hear it.
The unstruck music
vibrates in all of us.
Few can hear it.
Kara's one of the few.
Got a course for us?
Give me the ship.
Starbuck,
you have any idea where you're going?
The comet.
The...
It's the ship.
This is what I was meant to see.
Incoming, right, two high!
She's back.
Oh, frak.
Kara.
No, no. Take it easy, Kara.
Everybody made it okay.
You'll be fine.
No, don't touch it.
We need to get her out of here.
Get her some air.
Get the frak away from me!
They call you Athena now.
You even wear
their uniform like you're one of them.
You were the first to say no.
- No to what?
- The entire plan.
You joined the humans.
You had a child.
You showed us that we don't have
to be slaves to our programming.
We wanted the same thing,
but it turned out to be a disaster.
The Sixes have made one
mistake after another.
They have to be stopped
before they get the rest of us killed.
Ask.
You could help us.
You want me to lead
a mutiny against the Sixes.
It's the only way.
- You guys make me sick.
- Why?
Because you pick your side
and you stick.
You don't cut and run
when things get ugly.
Otherwise you'll never have anything.
No love, no family.
No life to call your own.
Now you guys can either help me
or get the hell out of my way.
<i>...'cause he will take your hand...</i>
<i>... guide you to the other side...</i>
When you're feeling a little better.
Can't you read a chart?
I'm not gonna feel better.
So take your needles
and your thermometers and your catheters
and stick 'em
where the sun doesn't shine.
<i>The undiscovered country...</i>
Hello.
Oh, great.
Now the President.
She stuck me three times today.
Be thankful
she hasn't put a catheter in you.
<i>Where we will bask
in the radiance of God's love.</i>
All this...
just to...
keep me alive for a few more days.
It's so pointless.
No, it's not pointless.
And I'm sure it isn't helping
listening to Gaius Baltar...
No, no, no, don't touch that!
Who the frak do you think you are?
<i>Accept him into your hearts...</i>
Leave me alone!
<i>It is all about love.</i>
<i>It's not about living a righteous life.</i>
<i>God doesn't really care
how many good deeds we've done.</i>
<i>This is the mistake that I find</i>
<i>that so many of the pious...</i>
The Hybrid will want to see you,
I know it.
- Let's go then.
- What are you doing?
You want to give her access to
the central nervous system of this ship?
- I thought we had a deal.
- We discussed this.
- Kara's the key to our salvation.
- We agreed on an alliance.
You want an alliance, I see the Hybrid.
Leoben claims it can help me find Earth.
There's no way around it.
We've tried to be patient about
your model's obsession with this woman.
Playing house with her
on New Caprica was one thing.
But this puts us all in Jeopardy.
We have their Raptor and their jump
drive. We don't need them.
- Frakkin' toaster...
- Barolay, don't.
You don't have time to figure out
our jump systems without our help.
Not before the other Cylons get back.
And if we do figure it out in time,
do we just keep running? How long before
we run out of fuel, food, ammunition?
How long before
Cavil's forces hunt us down?
Like it or not,
we have to work with the Colonials.
That means Kara sees the Hybrid.
Or you can kiss your asses good-bye.
Looks as if we have no choice.
But first, we do this.
Okay, we can do this.
We can give their ship jump
capability again by slaving its drives
- to our Raptor's spin sync generator.
- So just do it.
Their Hybrid was damaged in the attack,
so we're gonna have to pull her offline
and execute jumps from the Raptor.
Pull the Hybrid offline?
Absolutely not.
It's never been done
on an operational ship.
It would be like blinding her.
It might kill her.
If we don't do this before the other
Cylons come back, we're all dead anyway.
Make it happen, Lt.
Barolay,
yank the connectors from the bus
and strip the cables out of them.
You got it, Lieutenant.
And, Six, I'm gonna need
some data cabling right away.
Single mode, 1310, otherwise
you'll blow our system to shreds.
We started the interface.
Take me to this Hybrid.
Anders, you're on me.
Might be better if I stay here.
I know more about
the Raptor's system than they do.
- What the hell are you looking at?
- I know you.
You were on New Caprica.
You were part of the resistance.
You killed me.
Watched me drown, kicking and thrashing
like I was some kind of an insect.
Be happy to put you down again.
I'm okay.
Barolay?
Jean.
Jean!
You killed her.
You frakkin' killed her!
You want to know what
it feels like to die? You're nothing!
You're a frakkin' machine!
Sam, put the gun down now!
- Sam, stop!
- What do you want me to do, Kara?
You want me to forget about Barolay?
You want me to forget about New Caprica?
No frakkin' way!
She just killed Barolay!
Sam! Put the gun down.
- Put it down.
- Look into it.
Sam.
Sam,
you have no idea what's at stake here.
Look at me.
Put it down.
They killed one of us
and you're just ready to let it slide?
She's right.
You can't let this go, Kara.
If you don't want to do this, I will.
Put the gun down, soldier.
I need to see the Hybrid.
Why, sister?
I just couldn't let it go.
- On New Caprica...
- She was the one?
I never did anything to her.
We were working at the water
treatment plant and she just...
I know. I remember.
After you downloaded,
we tried to work through this.
How do you work
through something like that?
Never forget her expression
as I tried to scream.
Just...
Just slapped tape over my mouth
- and threw me in that septic tank.
- You shut your frakkin' mouth.
I still see her face
when I try and sleep.
We were trying to help those people.
I know.
I know.
I wish there was something I could do.
Then I'm glad it's you.
Gods damn it!
No resurrection ship.
You understand?
She's just as dead as your friend.
Is that enough human justice for you?
Blood for blood?
Madam President.
I wanted to apologize for before.
I have good moments and bad.
And that was which?
Come in here. I have something for you.
- For me?
- Yes, yes, come in.
Come in.
All right. Would you get it?
It's in the first drawer. Right here.
That's it, yes.
This is for me?
I hope it's not too gaudy.
This is beautiful.
Thank you. That's beautiful.
A woman on Aurora makes 'em.
Leslie Starus.
She makes all kinds
if you want to check it out.
Now, I think this one
will be just fine.
What color are you hoping for?
When it grows back in?
Well...
I was thinking maybe blue.
Nice royal blue.
Change of pace.
My hair used to be...
Now look at it. Feel it,
feel it.
It's gonna get a lot worse.
Be prepared for that.
<i>Because he will take our hands</i>
<i>and guide us
to the other side of the river.</i>
All these things at once and many more.
Not because it wishes harm,
but because it likes
violent vibrations to change constantly.
Then shall
the maidens rejoice at the dance.
Structural integrity
of node seven restored.
Repressurizing.
The children of the one reborn
shall find their own country.
The intruders swarmed like flame.
Like the whirlwind.
Hopes soaring to slaughter
all their best against our hulls.
I'm here. You wanted me here, so...
Replace internal control accumulators
4 through 19.
They'll start going ripe on us
pretty soon.
Compartmentalize integrity conflicts
with the obligation to provide access.
FTL sync fault uncorrected.
No ceremonies are necessary.
For what it's worth,
I voted for you in the last election.
And I don't like
how Baltar keeps ragging on you.
- But that is not why I listen to him.
- Why do you listen to him?
I had an experience that made me
rethink all my preconceptions.
What kind of experience?
It happened the night after Cottle
told me that
my cancer had spread to my liver
and I'd never be leaving this place.
I was on a ferry, crossing a river,
and as we were approaching
the other side,
I saw all these people
standing on the bank.
And we got closer, and
I recognized them.
My parents.
My sister Kathy, who died when I was 12.
My husband, my girls.
I was scared
for a moment.
You know, how is this happening?
But then I felt it.
This...
presence...
hovering all around me.
Warm,
loving, and...
It said...
"Don't be scared, Emily.
"I'm with you.
"Hold my hand
and we'll cross over together."
But a lot of people in our predicament
have dreams like that, Emily.
No.
I was there.
I felt...
The cool breeze coming from the water.
The spray from the bow.
Maybe he's stumbled onto something.
You know,
he talks about the river that separates
our world from the next.
That there's more to this existence
than we can see with our naked eye.
There's a power
that we can't begin to understand.
Then shall the maidens
rejoice at the dance.
Structural integrity of node seven
restored.
Repressurizing.
The children of the one reborn
shall find their own country.
End of line.
Reset.
Track mode monitor malfunction traced.
Recharge compressors.
Increase the output to 50%.
Assume the relaxation length
of photons...
Transfers contact is inevitable,
leading to information bleed.
FTL sync fault stands uncorrected.
- No ceremonies are necessary...
- I don't understand.
Centrifugal forces reacts
to the rotating frame of reference.
The obstinate toy soldier
becomes pliant.
- The city devours the land...
- You can't hurry her.
You have to absorb her words.
Allow them to caress
your associative mind.
Don't expect the fate of two great races
to be delivered easily.
Assume the relaxation length of photons
in the sample atmosphere is constant.
The intruders swarmed like flame.
Like the whirlwind.
Hopes soaring to slaughter
all their best against our hulls.
All these things at once and many more.
Not because it wishes harm,
but because it likes violent vibrations
to change constantly...
Hey, we're rigged and ready.
Time to pull her offline and get out
of here before we miss our rendezvous.
- Reset.
- Any luck, Captain?
Not a frakkin' thing.
But you are a spark of God's fire.
Core update complete.
Frak it! Unplug the damn thing.
Let's get the frak out of here.
Threat detection matrix enabled.
Dendritic response bypassed.
The received dose
is altered by the delayed gamma burst.
Going active.
Execute. The children of the one reborn
shall find their own country.
End of line.
Stop!
Athena!
What the hell happened?
What do you want from me?
Please,
I need you.
Thus will it come to pass.
The dying leader
will know the truth of the opera house.
The missing Three will give you the Five
who have come from the home of the 13th.
You are the harbinger of death,
Kara Thrace.
You will lead them all to their end.
End of line.
But this god
that Baltar refers to,
it is the Cylon god.
You know that, don't you?
If he's the one and true God,
he belongs to all of us.
Otherwise,
he's not much of a god, is he?
Exactly, he isn't much of a god.
He's a fantasy.
Oh, Laura.
And the Lords of Kobol are real.
Reigning from a metaphysical mountaintop
in those silly outfits.
Zeus handing out fates
out of an urn like...
like they were lottery tickets.
"You're gonna work on a tylium ship.
You're gonna be an admiral.
"Your family's gonna be
"evaporated
in an attack on the Colonies,
"but you'll survive for three more years
in a moldy compartment on a freighter
"till your body
starts to eat itself up alive."
Those are the gods that you worship?
Capricious, vindictive.
But they're not meant
to be taken literally.
They're metaphors, Emily.
I don't need metaphors.
I need answers.
You're like my mother. She wasn't
satisfied with metaphors either.
She was convinced that Aphrodite herself
was gonna swoop her away when she died,
and she believed it.
Even after the Doloxan
and the radiation
failed to stop her cancer.
She was a teacher. She was a...
She was something to behold in...
At the head of a classroom.
And her students...
Her students loved her. They...
they'd walk through fire for her.
And then you see this woman who...
seemed so...
eternal, she...
withered away,
and I find myself
having to change her diaper
because she couldn't even...
And at the moment she died,
there was no gleaming fields of Elysium
stretched out before her.
There was this...
dark...
black abyss.
And she was just terrified.
She was so scared.
I'm sorry.
Laura.
Laura.
You were terrified.
You saw only darkness.
You can't possibly
know what your mother experienced.
You're... you're still searching.
You're...
Doc Cottle! Doc!
- Do something!
- Nurse, get me some morpha quickly.
It's okay.
It's all right.
All we can do for her now is...
try to make her comfortable.
- That's all?
- I'm sorry, that's it.
All right.
It's as if
she doesn't even see us anymore.
She's looking past us.
I've seen that look many times,
but never in the eyes of a Cylon.
Athena.
You were right.
Forgive me.
It's okay.
I'm with you.
She will lead us to the end.
We will now know the truth
of the opera house.
The home of the 13th.
What?
The hybrid said, "the missing Three
will give you the Five
"who have come
from the home of the 13th."
The home of the 13th tribe of humans...
And the Five...
is your Final Five Cylon models.
And if they've come
from the home of the 13th tribe,
they must know the way back.
They know how to get to Earth.
And the missing Three
is the model you boxed
- for looking at the faces of the Five.
- D'Anna.
She can recognize 'em.
Let's go.
Demetrius is waiting for us.
We're here.
Mother.
You're okay.
I'm not ready.
<i>... You no longer
need to fear the unknown.</i>
<i>Because he will take your hand</i>
<i>and guide you
to the other side of the river.</i>
<i>What river am I talking about?</i>
<i>I'm talking about the river
that separates this world from the next.</i>
<i>There is more to reality</i>
<i>than the things that we can touch,</i>
<i>taste,</i>
<i>or even see with our naked eyes.</i>
<i>There is another realm.</i>
All hands to jump stations.
Prepare to jump the ship.
<i>All hands to jump stations.
Prepare to jump the ship.</i>
Come on, come on.
Sublight.
Go.
- Helm.
- Go.
- Nav.
- Go.
- Tactical.
- Go.
Jump solution checks. Nav is go.
FTL.
Drive's spun up 100% and stable, go.
The board is green.
She's gone.
Or they'd be back by now.
Execute jump in five...
Four... Three...
Dradis contact!
Cylon baseship.
It's right on top of us.
Hold the count! Hold the count!
Baseship is squawking colonial ID.
I've got a comm signal,
but it's really weak.
Speakers!
<i>Demetrius, Athena.
Demetrius, Athena.</i>
Gods, it's good to hear your voice.
Copy that, Helo.
The baseship is ours.
Mission accomplished.
Then let's go home.
I need to talk to you.
- Certainly. Come in.
- Thank you.
- Can I get you some water?
- Yes.
You really believe that there's
something in this horse manure that
Baltar's peddling?
I don't know.
Something is happening here,
and I don't really understand it, Bill.
You both had the same dream,
means...
What?
Talk to me. What's going on?
Kara comes back from the dead.
I let her go off chasing her vision
of Earth.
Well, she's overdue.
Lee
turns in his wings.
And Helo, Athena, Gaeta.
Will I ever see those kids again?
Bill.
Look at me.
I'm right here.
Right here.
We're going to find it.
Earth?
Together.
I used to think
it was such a pipe dream.
I used to use it
as a carrot for the fleet.
What made you change?
You.
You made me believe.
- =( Team Lords of Kobol )= -
<i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
I'm giving you a ship. Now go.
Find the way to Earth.
<i>Kara, I'm alone. This is not an attack.</i>
- <i>I knew I'd find you.</i>
- Leoben?
<i>I'm here to offer a truce
between human and Cylon</i>
<i>and a chance for you
to complete your journey.</i>
The Hybrid.
You need to go to her, Kara.
She'll tell you the way to get to Earth.
We're done here. Get him out of here.
We're ready to jump back on your order.
- We're not going back to the fleet.
- Captain Thrace,
as XO of the Demetrius,
I'm hereby relieving you of command.
You son of a bitch.
Gaeta, abort the jump!
I'll take Leoben to the baseship,
see if his story checks out.
We'll be waiting
till the clock runs out.
Looks like he wasn't lying
about a civil war.
This is it.
The comet. It's the ship!
Thus will it come to pass.
You are the harbinger of death,
Kara Thrace.
You will lead them all to their end.
<i>- Cylon baseship.
- Demetrius, Athena.</i>
- The baseship is ours.
- Then let's go home.
<i>Now I have learned</i>
<i>from unimpeachable sources</i>
<i>that President Laura Roslin
has for some time now</i>
<i>been sharing hallucinogenic visions</i>
<i>with two Cylons within our fleet:</i>
<i>one, Sharon Agathon,</i>
sent on the classified
Demetrius mission,
and the other, a Cylon prisoner
being held aboard the Galac...
- It's not that easy, Madam President.
- No? You should try it sometime.
Most of the population
has heard that broadcast.
I would assume that's the point.
Look, I take no pleasure
in putting this before you.
They practically had
to push me through that door.
I'm sure you're happy to stay.
I can't put one foot in front of another
without someone blocking my path
asking me what the hell is going on!
- For the welfare of the fleet...
- Excuse me.
As long as I am in this office,
the welfare of this fleet
is not something
you need to worry about.
You owe the people a response.
I owe the people?
That's what I believe.
What if your beliefs
were called into question?
- Madam President...
- Up is down.
Black is white. Scripture is fiction.
Home is thin air
instead of solid ground, etcetera.
I'm really sorry
for everything you've had to endure.
I really am.
But the people, they deserve a response.
- Do they?
- Is there any truth to this broadcast?
And what would you do
if I told you the truth?
What if it were you instead of me
and all that's left of humanity
has just been told
that you are sharing visions
with the enemy?
What would you do, Mr. Adama?
Would you think
that the Gods were testing you?
So Baltar is telling the truth?
Is it true?
Yes.
Demetrius reports their sys ops
will be synced with ours in 5 minutes.
When you came knocking
and asked for our help,
you gave away the future
of all the Cylons here, you know that?
- I gave it to the right person.
- Save it. No guarantees.
When we meet up with the fleet,
I don't know
if they'll feed you or frak you.
Since you've been calling
the plays up till now,
I'm assuming you're doing the talking.
Good.
Gods help us.
Sys ops of both vessels are synced.
We're as ready as we're ever gonna be.
Good. Tell the Demetrius
to set the board to green.
Unless both ships jump in together,
Galactica will blow us out of the sky.
<i>Demetrius, Athena.</i>
<i>Set your board to green.</i>
Athena, Demetrius. Starting to green.
Let's run the horn, guys.
- Sublight.
- Go.
- Helm.
- Go.
- Tactical.
- Go.
Nav.
Go.
FTL.
Spun up. Go.
Athena, Demetrius.
<i>Board is green.</i>
I was just thinking
how beautiful she must be.
Your daughter, Hera.
- How do you know her name?

Move, move, move!
Colonel,
they're with me.
They're with you?
So which one of them shot Gaeta?
Lieutenant Gaeta, stay with us.
Prep an IV.
All right, everybody. Stand back.
Get a cut down tray in here right now.
We became divided according to models.
The Twos, Eights, and Sixes
have come to
believe that our destiny lies
in seeking out the Final Five.
The Ones, Fours,
and Fives violently opposed such action.
We know that there are seven
different models of Cylons.
You only mentioned six.
The Threes.
The D'Annas.
They were boxed after the battle
on the algae planet.
Boxed?
Her entire line
was punitively deactivated.
Her consciousness
placed in a boxing facility.
Why?
D'Anna saw the faces of the Final Five,
which was forbidden.
But if we unbox her,
she can reveal their identities to us.
The Final Five have been to Earth.
If we help find them,
they can help us get there.
Our ship can heal itself.
But most of our Raiders
were destroyed in the ambush.
We're asking for your help here.
We can't do it alone.
What could possibly motivate us
to trust you now? What have you got?
The boxing facility
resides within
the Cylon resurrection hub.
This hub controls the functions
of every resurrection ship in existence.
It protects itself by periodically
jumping to a new set of coordinates
and then relaying them
back to the baseship.
Madam President,
you asked for a reason to help us.
Vengeance.
You destroy the hub,
Cylons lose their ability to download.
All of us.
Why would you be willing
to lose your ability to resurrect?
We're rebels.
We can't go back.
What matters most to us
is being with the Five.
D'Anna will be able to identify them.
We'll take you to the hub
if you help us unbox D'Anna.
Give us the coordinates
of the hub first.
No, I won't do that.
I said we would take you there.
Take her out. We're finished.
Wait.
Is your word good, Admiral?
I'll give you the coordinates.
But I want your word.
Stand down.
You have my word.
Once their identities are revealed
and we come back here,
we'll be free to leave
your fleet with the Five.
Yes.
They're here with you.
The Final Five are in your fleet.
That's why our Raiders
turned back the attack
in the nebula.
The weapons hold.
How the frak did you see that?
To be absolutely honest with you, Bill,
I didn't.
What can I say? We got lucky.
Well, let's get a Raptor up
to those coordinates
that that Cylon gave us.
- Maybe we can get lucky again.
- Sir.
Tigh.
Thank you.
Lords of Kobol, shield your eyes.
Get it with the gun camera.
Hit override.
Kinda pretty, isn't it?
Tell it to the fleet.
No. No. Don't put me under. Please.
Just... just numb everything.
Felix.
Just do it.
I don't want to wake up...
I don't want to wake up
with my leg gone.
Okay, son.
If we go in on our own horse,
we won't last five minutes.
But we go in with that baseship,
nobody's gonna notice us for awhile.
What do we fight with?
Their Raiders are frakked.
We don't use theirs. We use ours.
- Take half the Viper wing.
- Half the wing?
Yes. We'll sneak them in
on the rebel baseship.
Hoshi did some calculations
from Racetrack's photos.
We take out the FTL, the hub's stranded.
We blow the hub and
billions of skin jobs
lose their bath privileges.
Imagine.
Once they're gone, they can't come back.
Mortal enemies.
Before we blow the hub,
we need to get a team in
to unbox D'Anna.
Well, now, maybe we just don't.
Maybe we just forget
the Gods damn boxing facility.
- Lie to the rebels.
- Well, they're lying to us.
The skin jobs said
their Raiders won't fight
because the Final Five is here?
We tangled with those slit-eyed
black bastards
for three years now,
and they haven't turned back before.
Why now?
What if they're telling the truth?
What if the Final Five are here?
The Five could know the way to Earth.
If they knew, they're not
gonna lead us there after we've just
destroyed their resurrection capacity.
Maybe they're different,
like the rebels.
What if they're not?
What if their sole purpose
is to destroy us?
I say we blow
the whole Gods damn thing to dust...
lock, stock, and barrel...
and trust the President's vision,
her scriptures, her way to Earth.
Why don't we split the difference?
Unbox D'Anna and find the Five.
Keep the 5 till we get to Earth.
Turn them over to the rebels.
They've waited this long.
It'll be on our terms.
It's all pie in the sky, gentlemen,
until we know what's true
and what's not.
And we put a lid on it.
The real plan stays in this room.
If the plan gets leaked to the Cylons,
all bets are off.
Have someone escort the rebel leader
back to her baseship
so she can inform her people
they have a deal.
"In 36 hours,
the Colonies will unite forces
"with insurgent rebel Cylons
"and their leader
"in an unprecedented
joint military operation
"to destroy the Cylons' ability
to download
"into..."
Blah blah blah.
Why weren't we consulted?
I'm sorry. I'm in the dark
as much as all of you.
You know, if they unbox the D'Annas,
at least we'll find out
who the fifth one is.
All that's gonna do
is crowd the airlock a little more.
Do you think they're gonna give you
a medal when they find out who you are?
What about you?
He sings, you know.
- What?
- Gaeta.
Whenever he feels the tingling,
whenever he feels his phantom leg.
Cottle says it helps him get through it.
He sings.
Good morning.
Morning.
What is it about the Galactica
that gives you such a glow?
I come over here, it's like I'm going
from one dungeon to the next.
Oh, I hadn't noticed. But thank you.
- You ready?
- Yes.
I want you to find out
who's behind the shared vision rumors.
Who's talking to him?
- With Baltar?
- You're sleeping with him, right?
Don't.
I've just been informed
that you've been spotted down there
enough times to be a charter member
of his nymph squad.
All right.
I have
come to believe
in Baltar's spiritual message.
I don't know how or why.
It just happened.
I wish you knew how many times
I wanted to tell you.
Your friendship and your trust
- means...
- Frak.
Clearly my friendship
and trust mean frak.
And I don't really care
if you have to spend the night
on your knees praying
or just on your knees.
I want a name.
I want to know
who's responsible for these lies.
Madam President.
Laura,
I am so sorry.
You have a job to do.
The humans are never going to allow us
to have the Final 5 and go our own way.
Are you sure of this?
Not entirely.
I'd rather be wrong.
But we need insurance.
Trust has to begin somewhere.
Not with us.
It's our ship.
When we jump,
we take control of it
with the Centurions.
We carry out the mission as promised.
But when we return,
we take hostages.
The humans on this ship
stay on this ship
until we have the Five.
Look at me.
We've changed, but the humans haven't.
We've come too far
to risk everything on their trust.
What a way to discover
such a beautiful voice, huh?
How'd you find me?
- Your chief of staff.
- Needs to be horsewhipped.
If you came down here to kiss my ass
to get information, save your breath.
The Quorum's considering
a vote of no confidence against you.
I won't compromise
the success of this operation
or the safety of this fleet to indulge
the neediness of twelve
perpetually unhappy representatives.
I can't.
I was with them on the emergency jump.
And I saw something
in the faces of the delegates.
It wasn't the anxiety from waiting.
It went beyond that.
I was anxious. It was my first time.
But they...
They were empty.
The Quorum had given up.
And then it struck me that
after going through the same routine
so many times,
it was the only way that they could
cope
with the uncertainty.
To presume the worst.
You felt their
suffering.
Now try
holding their lives in balance
every day.
Talk to them.
 No need to tell them everything.
I know how it works.
Just talk to the Quorum.
Let them put a face
to this joint mission.
Let them hear from the Cylon leader.
Anything.
Anything to put their fears to rest.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
We've been lying here doing nothing.
What?
You've been lying
about the President
sharing visions with Cylons.
That happens to be
the God's honest truth.
Sorry. I can't accept what you've done.
What I've done? What have I...
What are...
- Where's this coming from?
- These rumors you've started.
I've seen what they've done to her.
You seriously believe
that I'm making all this up?
I am not saying I'm not capable,
but why would I?
Six revealed it.
Caprica Six revealed them to me
through my attorney
in the last days of my trial,
when a guilty verdict was a certainty.
I suppose I could've gone public.
- Caused a stir.
- And all this time, you kept quiet.
I'm not saying I'm a saint, Tory.
I'm many things.
But I try not to be spiteful.
Got no bloodlust to go get her.
But she's a hypocrite.
The lies.
The secret missions.
Co-opting the rhetoric of patriotism
to keep everyone in the dark,
including you.
That's rather worrying, isn't it?
So I had to speak.
The truth is,
no good ever comes from concealing it.
I've got a broadcast.
I didn't come here to beg
or plead or apologize
or to keep my job.
You know me better than that.
And I didn't come here
to create sympathy
by parading my illness in front of you.
On the contrary,
there are some that probably believe
that along with my cancer and drugs,
I have inoculated myself
against compassion.
That is a joke.
I am here because I want
to tell you face to face
that I believe in this mission
and what it means for our future.
I'm here to profess my trust
in our new allies.
I'm here to ask you to listen.
I'm here to ask for your support.
Bring her in.
In our civil war,
we've seen death.
We've watched our people die.
Gone forever.
As terrible as it was,
beyond the reach
of the resurrection ships,
something began to change.
We could feel a sense of time,
as if each moment
held its own significance.
We began to realize
that for our existence
to hold any value,
it must end.
To live meaningful lives,
we must die and not return.
The one human flaw
that you spend
your lifetimes distressing over,
mortality,
is the one thing...
Well, it's the one thing
that makes you whole.
I believe it was no accident
that we were found by Kara Thrace.
It was destiny.
She asked me to leave my people,
and I accepted.
No matter what the sacrifice
even if it should mean my death...
<i>... it come to pass.</i>
<i>The dying leader
shall know the truth of the opera house.</i>
<i>You are the harbinger of death,
Kara Thrace.</i>
Our destiny.
Our future
begins here.
Thank you for giving me the opportunity
to speak.
Take her out.
Hera!
Hera?
Bye-bye.
I gotta hand it to you.
If you are a Cylon,
that was a great plan.
Dangle yet another way to Earth.
Throw in the hub, the Final Five,
and the real kicker,
put the Final Five on the fleet.
Even I couldn't pass that one up.
You are having those visions,
aren't you?
Thus shall it come to pass.
The dying leader shall know
the truth of the opera house.
What did you say?
- Thus shall it come to pass.
- The opera house.
The dying leader shall know
the truth of the opera house.
Where did...
Where did you hear that?
Who told you that?
The Hybrid from the baseship,
before they unplugged it.
The Hybrid.
How does the Hybrid know
what's in my dream?
I wish I knew.
This has got to stop.
These visions. I've got to find out
about these visions.
I've got to know.
Will you help me?
Yes.
Find Captain Agathon.
When I spoke to the quorum,
I could feel it.
- The contempt.
- You were right.
They're not ready to trust us.
No, I was wrong.
We're not ready.
We're deceiving them.
For protection. For necessity.
Out of suspicion and fear.
Why haven't the Final Five come forward?
What if they're watching,
judging us on our actions?
We're about to resort
to violence and coercion.
What if they refuse to come with us?
We can't do this.
It's too late.
We have to order the Centurions
to stand down.
It's too late.
They're committed.
Then we have to tell the humans
the truth.
No.
You can't do that.
They'll never trust us again.
They already know the coordinates.
They'll just go destroy everything.
Go.
Stall for time.
Talk to Adama.
Tell them anything.
Anything but the truth.
I'll deal with the Centurions.
Of course.
Have a seat.
We're going to settle this now.
What's to settle?
Your chief of staff
is incomparably talented.
I've been sharing visions
with Sharon Agathon and the Six.
So I was only speaking the truth.
Yes.
The Hybrid on the baseship spoke
of an opera house and a dying leader.
We're going to talk to the Hybrid.
And why would you require my presence?
Because you're in my visions.
What are you doin', baby?
Are you drawing?
Can I see what you drew?
No!
No!
Why?
Why?
Hera?
Hera?
Hera...
<i>Raptor 1-2-4,</i>
<i>You are clear for landing...</i>
Hera!
Hera!
Hera!
- Have you seen my daughter?
- No, I haven't.
Hera!
I can't find Hera.
Get away from my child.
Get your hands off of my child.
Athena.
Stay back!
Stay away.
Stand down!
Plug it in.
I need to talk to it.
- Let God's will be done.
- Shut up.
It's time to get some answers.
Tyrol, will you come in here
and take Hera, please?
Just do it, Tyrol.
Come on.
Is she gone?
Yeah.
You are never gonna take my child.
We didn't come here to.
Jump!

Thus shall it come to pass.

Where did you hear that?
Who told you that?

I've got to find out
about these visions.
Plug it in.
It's time to get some answers.
Can I see what you drew?

Get away from my child!
You are never gonna take Hera.
Jump!
Heavenly father...
Give me the strength,
the wisdom, and above all...
Quickly.
All right,
on three. One, two,
three, lift!
Keep some pressure on that wound
until I can get to the artery.
Mask on.
- The President's been kidnapped?
- Baltar was with her.
- Are you saying he's responsible?
- I heard it was the Cylons.
- No, my people say she was shot.
- What are you talking about, Roslin?
No, one of Adama's marine shot a Cylon,
that is how this entire thing has begun.
- Where's Zarek?
- I don't know.
- Where is Zarek?
- Who's in charge here?
Vice-President Zarek is still waiting
to talk to you. What should I tell him?
Sir?
Deck crew says they just shipped over
the last of the Vipers.
That means we're down forty birds,
almost as many jocks.
We're gonna have to reconfigure the CAP.
Rethink our defense posture.
- Where is she?
- Clamp.
- Marines are holding her.
- My quarters.
Nobody has told us anything.
- No, no, no.
- All right, everybody.
Mister Vice-President,
we have some questions for you.
Thank you. Just calm down please.
Everybody, everybody,
just calm down, please.
Mister Vice-President,
it's really important that we know,
is the President dead?
- We have no information...
- She was assassinated by the Cylons?
There's no truth to that,
at least as far as we know.
- Then what the hell do we know?
- Clearly, our first priority
is to get out as much
verifiable information
as we can to avoid a general panic.
To that end,
I asked Admiral Adama to come
and answer our questions directly.
Unfortunately, he wouldn't take my call.
At this time, when...
However...
However...
Please, just a moment.
President Roslin
was apparently aboard the Cylon baseship
along with Gaius Baltar
and many of Galactica's pilots
when it jumped away,
after one of their own leaders was shot
aboard Galactica.
We have no idea
when or if they will return,
if the President or the other captives
will be subject to reprisals.
For now,
under the powers granted me by law,
I have taken over as President.
Hear, hear.
By refusing even to meet with Zarek,
you're simply helping him
fan the Quorum suspicions.
Their suspicions don't concern me.
<i>Look, maybe
he's not the man we hoped for,</i>
but he's next in line.
The fleet needs reassurance
and stability,
<i>frankly the kind that only
its military commander can offer.</i>
If this fleet needs reassurance,
then you reassure them.
<i>That's your job, now.</i>
You can tell Zarek
he can go to hell.
Why?
- Sir.
- Do you hate your people so much,
did you look for any excuse to kill one,
or did you deliberately try
to sabotage this truce?
No, sir, of course not.
Then you tell me why.
You make me understand why you did this.
They were gonna take her... the Six.
She was gonna take my child.
There were too many witnesses.
They all said the same thing.
Your daughter was lost.
The Cylon merely kneeled down
and was talking to her.
Maybe that's what it looked like, sir.
- But I know...
- You knew better.
I had a vision.
A vision where the Six and Baltar
were taking Hera away from me.
A vision!
It was more than just a vision, sir.
When I saw them together,
I knew that they would take her,
that they would take away my child.
You murdered
an unarmed woman.
And by doing so,
you put the lives of every single person
in this fleet at risk.
And quite possibly,
cost the lives of the President
and your husband.
You disobeyed the direct orders
of superior officer.
But more importantly,
you betrayed a promise to me.
I trusted you.
I will accept any form of punishment
that you think I deserve.
I just ask
that you please don't take away Hera.
I'm afraid the brig
is no place for a little girl.
Guards!
- Get her out my sight.
- Yes, sir.
At one time, Admiral Adama
supported Gaius Baltar's administration.
Is there a chance he'd support yours?
I'm afraid
only Admiral Adama can answer that.
Then I will address this question
to Delegate Adama.
Do you think that your father will
hand over power to this administration?
No.

Fine.
Recon Raptor just reported back.
The resurrection hub's gone.
No sign of the baseship
carrying the President,
assuming that's where they were headed.
They were determined
to resurrect the Three.
The one we used to call D'Anna.
To do that, they gotta go to the hub.
You find it and we'll find them.
- Easier said than done.
- Maybe.
We've got other problems.
Starbuck's having trouble fielding
enough planes to fly a standard CAP.
She wants us to consider
having the fleet bunch up tighter
so it's easier to defend.
Means counting on a bunch of civies
flying close formation.
Yeah.
Organize it.
I got you appointed
to this job.
Pulled strings,
called in favours.
All because I thought
you might do some good.
Now, you're advising me
to step aside from a position
that by law
is mine.
- A position I was elected to.
- But you were never elected President.
But I was elected to office!
Which is more than Roslin can claim.
Why do you think
she kept me on in the first place?
To thank me for rolling over?
No.
No, to help legitimize her coup.
In the military,
we used to talk
about facts on the ground.
Well, the facts on the ground are these:
Right or wrong, Adama will never
recognize you as President,
and we need someone he will.
Now, the Quorum has the legal authority
to appoint interim President
in a time of crisis.
And I suppose you have someone in mind.
No.
No, not yet.
Which is why we need
to form a search committee
and start looking for a candidate
as soon as possible.
Well,
good luck with that.
<i>So Zarek, do you really believe
that this government's in danger?</i>
<i>Let's face facts. What we had these past
five years isn't a true government,</i>
<i>but a tacit agreement
between a military strongman</i>
<i>and a political strongwoman
to rule together by fiat.</i>
<i>I heard you asked the Quorum
to authorize</i>
<i>the creation of a civil defense force.</i>
<i>After what happened
during the last military coup,</i>
<i>we don't want to depend on Galactica's
marines to guarantee our safety...</i>
You see the problem?
Lampkin's first rule of legal dynamics.
When an irresistible force
meets immovable object,
stand aside
and wait for the class action suit.
Except I'm not sure
if it's to anyone's benefit
if we just sit around,
waiting to pick up the pieces.
This thing's heading for a showdown,
there's gonna be bloodshed, unless...
Unless you can find someone else.
Someone your father won't reject,
someone the Quorum will approve of,
someone to take Tom Zarek's place
as interim President
until the next round of elections.
Don't take the case, Counselor.
It's a loser.
I have to.
<i>We</i> have to.
No one on the Quorum
is going to lift a finger.
Zarek's got them inhaling fear
and exhaling anger.
But you have taken
the pulse of the fleet
and you know character.
And frankly, you need a reason
to get out of this room.
Unless you want to start discussing
what's been keeping you here.
So you won't be dissuaded, will you?
Not even when you hear my fee?
- Fee?
- Appearances to the contrary,
I'm actually in this for the money.
I have a reputation to maintain
after all.
Okay, so what did Roslin offer you
to defend Baltar?
Room with a view.
Well, I'm not sure
I can improve on that.
Then pro bono it is, Counselor.
A word to the wise.
Sometimes it's better to settle
for what you've already got.
Colonel Tigh.
I understand you've
developed a relationship
with the Cylon prisoner.
That's not the word I'd use,
but she has been more cooperative.
See if she'll tell you
anything about the hub.
Bill.
We'll find her.
We'll find all of them.
The resurrection hub. How do we find it?
- I'm sure the others have told you.
- You tell me.
Only our hybrids can locate it.
And then,
only after it completes a jump.
Even they can't anticipate
where it's going.
You're holding back something.
I know it.
- You're lying.
- I have never lied to you, Saul.
Why don't you trust me now?
Because there are
too many lives at stake, lady.
Your buddies took off
with half an air wing,
not to mention the President
of the frakking colonies herself!
She's the real reason you're so angry.
So worried. I can hear it in your voice.
Why?
Why is a dying woman
so important to you?
Not to me, godsdamn it, to the old man!
Admiral Adama?
Saul?
- Do you love me?
- What?
Be honest with me.
I've been honest with you.
I don't believe this.
You're asking me if...
<i>Attention.
Set condition 1 throughout the ship.</i>
This has gone too frakking far!
I don't know what kind of mind games
you are playing with me, lady,
but it ends here!
What do we got?
One of our missing Raptors
jumped into dradis range.
- You sure it's ours?
- Transponder checks out.
It's one of the Raptors
that boarded the rebel baseship.
No radiological signature.
Racetrack and Skulls
are on their way to intercept.
<i>Actual, Racetrack.
I'm eyeballing our bird now.</i>
Looks shot to hell. Venting fuel and O2.
Still no response to hails.
Someone had to jump that bird.
I can't see a frakking thing from here.
Skulls, take the wheel.
I'm going for a walk.
<i>Decompression check okay. Opening hatch.</i>
<i>Safety line secure.
Moving toward the Raptor.</i>
<i>I'm seeing major damage to the canopy.</i>
<i>Looks empty inside.</i>
<i>I've got the hatch open, but it's stuck.</i>
Grav field's off.
It's Pike.
<i>He's dead.</i>
This is the shuttle
she took over to the baseship.
Laird was able to salvage
the flight data recorder.
Puts the originating jump point deep
in sector Delta 9.
President Zarek called again,
he heard about the Raptor
- and he's waiting to be briefed.
- Recall the CAP.
Spin up the FTLs.
- What about the fleet?
- Let's go.
We are essentially looking
for an understudy. The quandary is...
One doesn't generally
get the chance to...
wield political power
without the ambition
to actively seek it.
Easy, Lance.
That same ambition
often compromises the unselfish motives
that begat the quest.
In other words,
a battle of Id versus Ego
that Ego rarely wins.
Roslin never sought power.
Exception that proves the rule.
One could argue that Laura Roslin
is a study in repressed ambition.
Just like you, Mr. Adama.
Never seeking out a job
until it's handed to you.
Flight leader, Battlestar commander,
Quorum delegate.
A man doesn't carve out
a path like that through life without...
All right, enough of the psychoanalysis.
Let's get back to the job in hand.
Does your father have some other place
he wants to go?
What?
Where the hell did they go?
And why didn't they tell us?
Galactica, Racetrack. We've located
the source of the transponder.
It's Sandman's Viper all right.
<i>- But no Sandman.</i>
- Affirmative.
Keep searching.
We're getting radiation signatures
from multiple nukes.
Baseship fragments,
other debris
indicative of resurrection technology.
I'm afraid
it paints a pretty clear picture.
They found the hub
and they destroyed it.
Looks like our pilots helped.
Question is, where'd they go from here?
You are way too close to this.
The President's baseship was destroyed.
It's a different baseship.
We'll search every square inch
of this debris field,
- until we come up with a clue.
- What, and leave the rest of the fleet
back there with their asses
hanging in the wind?
Detail four Raptors to stay behind.
They keep searching
until they find something concrete.
Give my order.
People, listen up.
What are we gonna do here?
All right, everybody.
Gather around, please.
- Mister President.
- Please, please...
Sorry, Admiral Adam will not be coming
to answer your questions.
I did learn, however,
that he contacted the fleet's Captains
to inform them that several
of their ships will be requisitioned
to expand the search for Laura Roslin
and the missing baseship,
while our tylium shipments will be
diverted to support that mission.
But he's bypassing us completely!
I understand... We're doing the best...
I understand.
We're trying to get some communication.
Captain Franks.
I was impressed by her gravitas
during her turn as judge
in the Baltar trial.
That and her vote, naturally.
No. She's already been approached to run
for office. No interest in politics.
Sadly, now she really impresses me.
Gods.
You ever feed that animal?
Where is he, anyway?
<i>Come on, Romo.
Let's put our heads together.</i>
<i>Who would Adama respect as President?</i>
What does this...
search for paragons net us anyway
except greater guilt
at our own failings?
Or worse.
The idiot's illusion of a clean slate,
a fresh start.
We haven't ruled out
all these names yet.
This one's a looser.
An exercise in futility.
Lawyers...
How this is gonna affect the President?
The break in her treatment?
Assuming no other changes
in her circumstances?
Yes.
Doloxan really kicks your ass,
so she actually
might feel better at first.
But any break gives the cancer
a chance to regroup.
Makes it that much harder
to beat it back.
Plus she's taken a hit
to her immune system
so she'll be vulnerable to infections.
How long?
The sooner you get her back here,
the better her chances are.
And while you are digesting that,
I have some other news...
I ran some tests on your Cylon prisoner.
Guess what I found?
Raptors are due back in a few hours.
Granted, if they'd found anything
we would have heard from them by now.
Still,
once we correlate their reports...
I'm not interested...
in the search.
You're not?
I know that you've been spending
a lot of time interrogating the Six.
But now, the brig guards tell me
that every time, you order them out,
and you turn off the cameras.
I'm not torturing her
if that's what you're worried about.
I'm not.
That I could almost understand.
This I can't.
Cottle tells me she's pregnant.
What the frak
have you been thinking, Colonel?
Do you deny it?
You don't.
You can't!
What the hell have you been thinking?
Who is interrogating who?
How many  secrets
have you told this thing?
How can you even ask me that?
Question my loyalty?
Your loyalty?
I need more than your loyalty.
You're my first officer.
I need judgment.
I need your competence.
I'm through jeopardizing this ship,
because of your weaknesses.
- Yes, your weaknesses!
- You're risking all our lives for what?
Our missing pilots? No, for a woman.
- For a frakkin' woman!
- You watch what you say about her!
She's the President. Not some skinjobs
that I've been banging.
What do you think Ellen
would say about this?
- Leave Ellen out of this.
- What would she say about her husband
impregnating a frakking Cylon prisoner.
You mother frakker!
You know how many times
I've had to repair this thing?
What are you gonna do with that woman?
What are you gonna do about Laura
if you ever find her?
I don't know.
Have the Raptors and the civilian ships
begin the search
from Phantom's last known position.
Is that a problem?
Sir, respectfully,
I've already got two missing pilots,
and hardly enough birds
left to protect this fleet.
Now you're asking me to send
the Raptors out on a blind search
looking for a ship
that very well may be destroyed.
My people are gonna feel like they're
being asked to go on suicide missions.
I'm not asking.
You're dismissed, Captain.
Admiral Adama?
Mr. Lampkin, what are you doing here?
Writs of forfeiture
for the ships you're borrowing.
The captains want
to be absolved of any blame,
should anything untoward happen.
One of the less ennobling consequences
of a legal culture.
No one wants responsibility.
Lee said you once gave him something,
before a mission.
A lighter, was it?
Belonged to my father.
Foolish to think a hunk of metal
could keep him safe.
And yet, that's what we do, isn't it?
Hang on to hope
in every hopelessly irrational way
that we can.
But not like those poor bastards
giving away their luck
just when they need it most.
It's like they've given up.
If you've never been in combat,
you have no idea what they're thinking.
I always imagined you
a realist, Admiral.
Not one to indulge a vain hope
at the cost of lives.
But then...
everyone has his limits.
"Sine qua non", as they say.
Without which not.
Yes.
Those things we deem essential
without which you cannot bear living.
Without which life in general
loses its specific value,
becomes abstract.
You may have a point, Counselor.
Then while I'm on a roll...
Tom Zarek may not be an ideal President,
but we could do worse.
You're right.
There are limits to my realism.
Goodbye, Counselor.
I can't give up on her.
I can't let her go.
I've lost my objectivity.
And now that I see that,
I have no choice.
Tell the Quorum that I'm relinquishing
command effective immediately.
No man is perfect.
No man is less perfect
than a candidate for high office.
And thus...
the ranks of likely suspects
is winnowed to none.
What if we're going about this
backwards, hey, Lance?
What if instead of picking names
and finding fault,
that we ask ourselves
the qualities that we want...
No.
No, what we need
is a new chief executive
and see who fits that bill.
Honesty, of course.
The wisdom to recognize the correct
from popular choice.
As well as the courage
to see it through.
Experience.
When the wrong choices cost lives
and the right ones save.
Tall order.
We might as well spell out one name.
Just one.
One we knew from the start.
Sometimes you take on a losing case
and you make yourself a believer.
Other times,
no matter what you tell yourself...
in your heart...
you know the outcome is fixed.
The verdict inevitable.
Lance, defense rests.
Come on.
Apologies.
I couldn't wait to tell you.
- Tell me what?
- We found our candidate.
Someone the Quorum won't hesitate
to approve
even over Zarek's objections.
Someone the Admiral can't help
but accept.
Yeah? Who?
Congratulations, M. President.
My name was never on that list.
Of course not!
That would be too blatant.
But it is everything
you always wanted, isn't it?
Why you had me cross
47 names off that list.
Come on.
Admit it.
Savor your victory, M. Adama.
'Cause you'll never get
the chance to serve.
- What are you doing?
- Why?
'Cause you're perfect for the job,
of course.
'Cause after the vicious aberration
that was Baltar's presidency,
and the bitter disappointment
that was Roslin's,
you are
a shining beacon of hope.
Only hope is the last thing we need.
We're a doomed race.
And it's time that we made our peace
with that essential truth.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Why?
You wanna know why?
Open it!
Frak!
That's right.
They killed my cat!
- They?
- They!
Those debased dregs of humanity
out there.
Our lost tribe in search of a new home
so they can roost and rot again.
Romo, how long has the cat been dead?
How long?
It's irrelevant, it's immaterial.
- Since it wasn't even my cat!
- Romo.
- It's been dead for weeks.
- It belonged to my wife.
I just retrieved it
from a vet on Geminon
when the bombs started to fall, and fate
presented me with a choice.
I could get back on that shuttle or
I could run home and...
try to save my family.
- How do you think I chose?
- Romo,
we've all had to make difficult choices.
You don't think I know?
Your wife's name was Faye.
You had two daughters,
Jennifer and Katie.
There were over 200 passengers
on that shuttle.
Only a handful chose to stay behind.
Right, it was in your file
when you handed the job
as Baltar's council.
But no one blamed you, Romo,
because at a certain point
we all made decisions
that saved our lives
at the cost of others.
You think you're unique, Romo?
- Think your sins are so special?
- Is that it, Counselor?
You're gonna rest your entire case
on that pathetic little bit of insight?
No...
on this.
The clean slate, the fresh start,
maybe they are illusions,
like you said.
But at a certain point,
faith in ourselves,
in our right to survive,
as a species, as a people,
that's not a given...
That's a choice.
Well, I've made mine.
And if you can't stomach that,
then you had damn well
better squeeze that trigger right now.
Go on.
What are you waiting for?
Or you can make a choice.
Put your past behind you.
Put the gun down.
And help me.
Because I'm telling you,
I'm gonna make a difference
in this fleet.
Is that your final word?
That's up to you.
Then swear it.
I,
Leland Joseph Adama,
do now avow and affirm...
That I take the office
of President
of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol
without any moral reservation
or mental evasion.
<i>That I take the office</i>
<i>of President
of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol</i>
<i>without any moral reservation</i>
<i>or mental evasion.</i>
This is a frakking joke.
You're the only man I can trust
to command this ship.
Maybe you're crazy enough
to pull a stunt like this
but you can't be crazy enough
to leave me in charge.
In case you forgot, my last term
at the helm was a complete disaster.
That was a long time ago.
You're not the same man you were.
You're not even the same man
who came back from
New Caprica.
You found out a lot about yourself.
Been tested in ways
that I can't barely begin to imagine.
You're ready.
Besides,
don't count on this being permanent.
What if it is?
Put these on...
and you lead the people
to Earth, the best way you can.
The fleet has stayed here too long
already.
Any other last orders?
Just one.
Give Athena back her daughter.
She needs her family.
We all need our family.
Take care of this one.
All right, let me see the changes
before you get this out to the press.
- All right.
- Thank you.
Mr. Lampkin.
Romo.
One day in office and
you've already got a first pet.
Jake here is a genuine
hero of the resistance.
Aren't you, Jake? Unfortunately,
his previous owners had to let him go.
Jake, meet Romo.
Romo, meet Jake.
Your new best friend.
If there's one thing I hate
more than cats, it's dogs.
See, a new pet for you to loathe.
I knew it would be the perfect gift.
Good luck, Jake.
I hear you're keeping Zarek
as Vice-President.
I can use the advice.
And as long as he knows he's heard,
I think I can trust him.
I don't know if I agree
with your thinking.
Well, I could say
the same thing about yours.
The only difference is
you're gonna be President,
I'm just getting in a plane.
Waiting alone in a Raptor,
while the rest of the fleet jumps away,
that's not just getting in a plane.
That sounds a lot like...
It sounds a lot like suicide, Dad.
At least this time
I'm only risking my own neck.
So I guess it won't matter
if as President
I order you not to do this.
I don't know
if I ever told you this, but
one of my first missions
was a solo recon.
Me alone in a Raptor
in enemy space.
I'm not gonna lie to you, I was scared.
Told myself that I was doing my duty,
and ultimately I faced my fear.
That's a good memory.
Why are you doing this?
Because I can't live without her.
And Laura's gonna get
to the rendez-vous point.
I have to believe that.
- Admiral.
- Admiral.
What do you hear, Starbuck?
Nothing but the rain, sir.
Grab your gun and bring the cat in.
Yes, sir.
Keep a light on, I'll be back.
You can count on it.
Galactica, this is Husker,
I'm in position.
Affirmative, Husker.
All fleet ships,
this is Galactica actual.
Commence jump.
<i>Previously on
</i>Battlestar Galactica...
The Threes, the D'Annas,
they were boxed
after the battle on the algae planet.
Why?
D'Anna saw the faces of the Final Five.
But if we unbox her,
she can reveal their identies to us.
The Final Five have been to Earth.
If we help find them,
they can help us get there.
So what could possibly
motivate us to trust you now?
The boxing facility resides
within the Cylon resurrection hub.
This hub controls the functions
of every resurrection ship.
We destroy the hub,
Cylons lose their ability to download.
The Hybrid on the baseship spoke
of an opera house and a dying leader.
We're going to talk to the Hybrid.
And why would you require my presence?
Because you're in my visions.
President Roslin was apparently
aboard the Cylon baseship,
along with Gaius Baltar
and many of Galactica's pilots
when it jumped away.
Hub's gone.
We're getting radiation signatures
from multiple nukes.
Baseship fragments.
The President's baseship was destroyed.
It's a different baseship.
Waiting alone in a Raptor
as the rest of the fleet jump away,
that sounds a lot like suicide, Dad.
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I can't live without her.
Plug it in. I need to talk to it.
- Let God's will be done.
- Shut up.
It's time to get some answers.
Jump!
Elosha.
Oh, my Gods.
Filters...
Filters the sublime elevation...
Why did it jump? Where are we?
I'm more concerned about why we're here.
Why don't I talk to the Hybrid?
Find out why.
- She can just do that. She can just...
- Jump!
Will you walk with me?
Galactica.
It...
What's going on? It's empty.
It is.
Feels bigger this way, doesn't it?
It's so quiet. It's strange.
A lot of things are strange.

Wing beats of a dove drown out
the heartbeats of those who follow.
- The Six is back in the stream.
- That's unusual.
To jump again so quickly.
- What do you think it means?
- Look, it knows me.
It trusts me.
I think...
I think it even likes me.
You're getting information
from this liquid?
The Hybrid is disorganized.
It's panicking. I don't know why.
Tell me. Why are you jumping the ship?
The Six...
The Six who went among the makers
is no longer.
End of line.
Back in the stream that feeds the ocean
that feeds the stream.
The Six.
She means Natalie,
the Six who was our leader.
She's either been hurt or killed
back on Galactica.
That's why the Hybrid's panicking.
So she's upset.
Okay, fine. Can you... calm her down?
- Can you tell her to jump back?
- It doesn't work like that.
She makes her own decisions.
And we can't unplug her because now
she's wired herself into life support.
All right,
then why don't we give this a go?
Hey, stop jumping the ship, all right?
Calm your mind.
Cease countdown, cease countdown.
Circulation, ventilation, control.
Filters.
- Filters... The sublime elevation...
- Did you see that?
I just opened myself up to it,
on a spiritual level...
Jump!
Don't you just hate these people?
No.
But you don't love them either.
The people in this room are
the closest thing you've got to family,
and you...
You've been their President.
Watch them try to comfort each other.
At least you haven't taken that
away from them...
yet.
You didn't rob them of their empathy...
yet.
You just don't make room
for people anymore.
You don't love people.
Is that clear enough?
Practical enough for you,
Madam President?
I think we're going
towards the resurrection hub.
I think the mission is still on.
You sure there's no ETA at the hub?
No, the hub is jumping
and our Hybrid's jumping after it.
Sometimes we're showing up
six hours after it's moved on.
Sometimes, like, six minutes.
And one time it'll be within
one jump-length and we'll catch it.
But we don't know when.
So we'll have to assume that any jump
could be the one
that drops us in next to it.
They're gonna read our heat signatures
the second we fire up the first Viper.
Hell, they'll read our electronics.
Yeah, if we could only mask that.
Go in cold.
No electronics at all.
We'll send the Vipers out dead,
towed by Cylon birds.
They'll never see it coming.
Take out the hub's jump drive,
then settle in for the long fight.
Yeah, good, okay, okay.
But you and me, we've got to get
onto the hub in the middle of that mess
and try to find D'Anna.
We can do this.
No, I don't know.
It's crazy, isn't it? We're putting
ourselves right where the action is.
It's not a great plan.
There's no time.
Let me help you.
Athena, my wife, she learned to do that.
She never did that when I met her.
What?
I got curious about Athena.
About her and Hera and you.
So I accessed her...
Her memories from her last download.
You have her memories.
Yeah,
and they're mine now too.
They're as real as my own.
I know this must feel like
a violation of trust or something, but
I don't...
I don't want it to be strange,
okay?
Right.
Right, sure.
Madam President?
Sir?
Hope I didn't wake you.
Come in.
Thank you for the use of your Raptor.
I needed some familiar surroundings.
Don't worry. I'll give it back to
Lieutenant Pike the second you need it.
About that.
This mission, it's very risky.
If there's even a chance
that we can go in and blow up that hub
and end Cylon resurrection
for all Cylons forever,
we must take it.
I cannot back away from that.
Yes, sir.
If
and when D'Anna
comes back from the dead,
bring her to me.
I think the Cylons think
that she'll be interrogated
by both groups together.
I'm sure they do.
Bring her to me.
She knows the identies
of the Five Cylons
in our fleet.
It is a matter now of human security,
and I will not
let the Cylons have audience
to that discussion.
I want to talk to her alone.
Yes, sir.
Good.
Welcome home, D'Anna.
You told me I'd never
have to go through this again.
I lied.
You thought
you were putting me away forever.
So what changed?
War.
A genuine Cylon civil war.
Ones and Fours and Fives
against Twos and Sixes and Eights
that objected to your retirement.
Now your supporters are working
with humans against all the rest of us.
All in your name.
Boomer's an Eight.
Shouldn't she be on the other side?
Boomer's my pet Eight.
She's seen the light of reason.
And an Eight can make a passionate ally.
Till she sees something shiny.
Why'd you bring me back anyway?
I brought you back to heal us, sister,
and end this shameful war.
Since Cylon pilots don't use call signs,
we're gonna be painting
unique identifiers on all their birds.
It's a relief.
You address them, use that number, okay?
Should've scrubbed
this frakkin' mission.
Everyone, listen up.
These heavy Raiders
aren't like the other Raiders.
They aren't gonna make any hinky moves.
They're under control of their pilots.
The Cylon pilots
are in charge of their birds.
- There are tiny pilots inside of them?
- We do our jobs.
- Training is just as good as yours.
- Oh, yeah?
Twenty-some of you
I've taken out weren't that good.
Redwing.
Redwing!
Now let's talk about
the surprise element.
First wave of Vipers are gonna ride in,
engines cold, dradis and comm off, okay?
You're gonna come in towed
by cables from the heavy Raiders.
- We're rigging 'em up now.
- Captain, I don't know,
if they're all tied together here,
kissing their gasholes so to speak,
and they tap on the brakes,
we're gonna smash right in the back.
They won't. It'll work, you guys.
Really. When you're close enough,
the cable's gonna disconnect.
We're mounting
explosive charges to cut it.
Hold it, hold it.
- We cut the cable, right?
- Cylon pilots cut the cable.
Then you sling out of their birds
and you turn your power on.
You're gonna be gunning
directly at the hub's FTL.
Then it's an all-out fight until
we get there with the nukes.
So if the Cylons don't lift up,
we're toast?
No, look, I'm serious.
Pilots!
You've flown with Cylons.
You've flown with Athena.
You put your life in her hands
and she hasn't betrayed you.
Well, I am the same as her.
Now all of these Cylons here,
all of these people,
they're pilots like you.
And they're gonna be out in the soup
with you taking out other Cylons,
just like Athena does
every time she's asked to.
And when that hub is taken out,
all of their lives will be at risk.
Just like yours.
So you might want to think
about how you're gonna work together.
Because we're all dead if you don't.
Moving on.
Just go and ask it already.
I've been told that you said
something about an Opera house, and I...
- Because it seems pointless.
- Look, there was an Opera house.
An Opera house.
Are you listening to me?
Apparently I was in the Opera house.
I had a vision.
I was chasing after a little girl.
I came to a door. I saw
Dr. Baltar and the Six take the child.
And... She's not listening.
Protect the child.
She said, "Protect the child."
- That's what Caprica said.
- I was the one holding the child,
so obviously I was the one
protecting the child, wasn't I?
- In the opera house...
- No.
It wasn't at all clear
what you were doing.
- Let me listen.
- Booting up.
Obviously you've done this
a thousand times before.
- I'm doing the same thing you're doing.
- No, you're not actually.
Because if you'll watch what I'm doing,
I'm actually focusing on her, all right?
Tell us what happened
in the opera house, all right?!
The only thing you're doing is yelling.
- Such a format will close the doors.
- "Close the door". No, open the door.
I want to open the door! Do it again!
I'm going for a walk.
Love to see you do any better.
- All right, I'll do it. Open the door!
- Three!
The Three is online.
- Accessing data. Loading data.
- The Three is D'Anna. D'Anna is online.
- D'Anna... D'Anna's back in a body.
- Booting up.
Jump!
Why are we doing this again?
<I don't want to see this again.
The ancients used to say:
"a people is only as strong
as the body of its leader."
If I follow that thought,
are you saying that humanity died
because I died?
If you're my subconscious,
I've gotta say
you're a little full of myself.
Humanity didn't die because you did.
The ancients got a lot of things wrong.
The body of a people is not the same
as the body of its leader.
But the soul and the spirit might be.
Oh, I see, so you're only laying
morality at my feet. Well, that's okay.
I can take that.
There are a lot of people who have sins
far greater than mine.
You're thinking of Gaius Baltar.
"Then I dug into the stump
"and pulled rocks from the ground
until my fingers bled.
"I collected seeds
from the few fruits the island offered,
"and planted them in long,
straight furrows,
"like the ranks of soldiers.
"When I finished,
I looked at what I had done.
"I did not see a garden.
I saw a scar.
"This island had saved my life,
"and I had done it no service."
I can see a real hierarchy around here.
And I have to tell you, you're on
the lower end of the scale, my friend.
Yes, you are.
Which is odd
when you think about the Cylon god.
They told you about God, didn't they?
I'm not even really sure if the Hybrid
was referring to D'Anna,
but if it's true...
- It certainly would make it easier.
- How so?
Well, we...
wouldn't have to find a...
Find a body.
Yes, good. Okay.
Go get her and bring her here.
Something else?
It's just once you have what she knows,
I can't help feeling like you could try
to keep Earth for humans only.
And I just...
Madam President, that doesn't seem...
What?
... honest.
You're supposed
to be conducting a fair deal here,
and instead you're taking D'Anna off
by yourself.
- Taking what she knows.
- Slow down, Captain.
At best,
D'Anna knows the identies
of the Cylons in our fleet.
And at best,
they know a way to Earth.
So you're not denying you'd keep the way
to Earth to yourself if you could.
I'm not saying that's true.
I will say
that if the Cylons had the option,
that's exactly,
exactly what they would do.
No, I don't think so.
Not the Sharons, the Eights.
Captain,
you are not married
to the entire production line.
I cannot afford
to be sentimental right now,
and I cannot afford you
to be sentimental either.
If you can't do this job,
find me someone who can.
What is that?
I think we're there.
Something's going on.
Another baseship, unscheduled.
You've gotta speak
to the Twos and Sixes and Eights
and tell them they've gone too far.
No.
Why don't you ask about the final five?
You never ask about them.
Because I don't believe
we're meant to know them.
Well, I'll tell you.
I will tell you.
I'll start shouting out their names.
Why do you risk it?
Are you going to help end this war
or are you useless?
25 heavy Raiders just launched
from the new arrival,
heading our way.
Come on, let's get this carpool started.
Now!
Cut the frakkin' cable now,
you frakkin' bastard!
The inhibition's been lifted.
- I sense it.
- It's the rebel baseship.
I think they're gonna attack.
- They're gonna blow the hub.
- That would be mass murder.
Death would be permanent for all of us.
They've gone insane.
Permanent death?
Well, that makes this all
the more meaningful.
<i>Helo, we've blown their FTL.
That hub's not going anywhere.</i>
Okay, take us down.
Well, he's your god as well.
And God doesn't want
any of his creations to be...
slaves.
Not that you're a slave...
Exactly.
Go.
This place is gonna go. Grab her.
Run!
<i>Hardball, Pike. I'm hit.</i>
My attitude control is down,
and I can't even program
any frakkin' ordnance.
Pike, hardball.
Man, don't jump.
You'll never make it to Galactica.
You know how many jumps that is?
I'm out of here.
Okay, I'm jumping back home.
Karl...
Come on, let's go.
Go!
There was this dog, see,
and the master had placed a bit of food
on the edge of its snout.
And the dog had to wait
until he was told he could eat it.
I know.
Pathetic.
Pathetic, isn't it?
Put him over there.
Wait.
Easy, Smith.
Easy, easy.
Okay.
- Find out what's going on!
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
- Easy, easy.
- Thank you.
Good.
Okay, wait.
Sorry.
You have this...
you have this big hole in your hide,
as Cottle would say.
Okay.
All right.
I'm gonna do this again.
- Thank you.
- It's the least I can do.
I think you're gonna live... as usual.
You know something?
- What?
- You're very pretty.
Man, that morpha worked fast.
Still.
Do you know why I'm so serene right now?
You're doped out of your mind?
Because I know God.
You need God, Laura.
Really, you'd be a different woman.
I know God.
Therefore, I know myself.
Truth is...
I was harboring the most awful,
desperate guilt.
A heavy, dark...
unimaginable...
soul-breaking guilt.
Now it's gone.
Now it's gone, it's...
been transformed into...
I have been transformed.
What was your guilt about?
I have no guilt.
What was your guilt about?
I gave the access codes to the Cylons.
They wiped out most of humanity.
Of course, I didn't know that's what
I was doing at the time exactly,
but that's what I did.
And when I realized what I had done,
the magnitude...
In that moment, I was saved.
I was loved...
by God.
Looking back...
I think I was rewarded.
Rewarded.
Pythia talks about the flood
that wiped out most of humanity.
Nobody blames the flood.
A flood is a force of nature.
Through the flood,
mankind is rejuvenated, born again.
I was another flood,
you see.
I blamed myself.
I blamed myself.
But God made the man
that made that choice.
God made us all perfect.
And in that thought,
all my guilt flies away...
Flies away like a bird.
I can give you that peace,
Laura, that freedom.
Pray with me.
Pray with me.
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- It's all right.
You're fine.
You're fine.
Don't do this to me.
Don't do this to me, please.
<i>We have D'Anna on board.
We are clear of the hub.</i>
<i>Commence nuclear strike.</i>
<i>Repeat, nuclear strike is a go.</i>
And with a whimper, every Cylon
in the universe begins to die.
Yes, that's right.
And it's a good thing, D'Anna.
Because now there's no difference.
We can all start trusting each other.
Don't do this to me.
Don't...
Don't do this to me.
Don't do this to me, please.
- Please.
- No.
I'm not saying Baltar's done more good
than harm in the universe. He hasn't.
The thing is,
the harder it is to recognize
someone's right to draw breath,
the more crucial it is.
If humanity is going to prove itself
worthy of surviving,
it can't do it on a case-by-case basis.
A bad man feels his death
just as keenly as a good man.
What do you want from me here?
Laura.
Just love someone.
Love...
You go.
You go.
You go to your rest now.
I'm not gonna be selfish anymore.
You go.
Rest.
No.
No...
No, please, no.
Stop bleeding.
Stop the bleeding.
Okay, good. Don't go.
All right, we've gotta get D'Anna
to the control room.
No, that's not the plan.
What? What plan?
Interesting.
Please don't go, Gaius.
Please.
I don't know how...
All right, put it in.
I have to take her directly
to the President. No one else.
That wasn't the deal.
I'm just doing
what she told me to do, okay?
Double dealing.
It's very human.
You never got that, Eight.
No more.
No more, don't go.
Please don't die.
Live.
I'm not saying I agree.
I'm saying it's my orders.
So I pretty much just made
a prize fool of myself, didn't I?
Trust.
Can we go find the President now?
Gaius?
Gaius, it's me.
The hub's been destroyed.
Good.
Don't let anyone in here
whatever it takes.
Thank you.
He's injured,
but I think he's going to survive.
I think it's gonna be
a long time jumping back.
I've got time.
Is that right?
You went to a lot of trouble
to bring me here.
Deceiving your so-called allies.
I suppose you've got
some questions for me.
Yes, I do.
I'd like to talk
about the five Cylons in my fleet.
So you know about the Final Five.
I know they're supposed to know
the way to Earth.
But you don't know
that you're one of them?
Your face!
It's ridiculous! No, look,
I'm not giving you any names.
Not until I feel like I'm safe.
Cause information is all I got, sweetie.
I'm mortal now.
In fact, I'm the only Three
in the whole darn universe.
So I gotta worry
about protecting myself.
I'll tell you who the Final Five are
when you take me back to your fleet.
And by the way, Laura,
I would've said the same thing
if you'd have met me
with a whole lot of Cylons,
cause I don't trust anyone right now.
So all this deception,
complete waste of time.
To remove the pump
with the attached hose and wiring,
simultaneously release the three tangs
while pulling the pump
out of the retainer
along with the line and wiring.
You lied to me.
Did I?
I thought I was earning
humanity's right to survive.
It's not a vending machine, Laura.
You don't save a life, and then...
cue the celestial trumpets...
Here's the way to Earth.
I know.
Jump!
Disorienting, isn't it?
All these little limping steps back.
I like it.
I'm used to it.
Every jump brings us
a little bit closer to home.
Galactica.
My home.
Maybe there's something there for me.
Maybe even closer.
Missed you.
Me too.
I love you.
About time.
- =( Team Lords of Kobol )= -
<i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
I just finished the post-flight
on Starbuck's Viper.
This thing looks like
it's been rolled off the showroom floor.
It's time to get some answers.
Plug it in.
Jump!
President Roslin was apparently
aboard the Cylon baseship,
along with Gaius Baltar and many of
Galactica's pilots when it jumped away.
Waiting alone in a Raptor
as the rest of the fleet jump away.
That sounds a lot like suicide, dad.
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I can't live without her.
<i>We have D'Anna onboard.</i>
<i>We are clear of the hub.
Commence nuclear strike.</i>
So you know about the Final Five.
I know they're supposed to know
the way to Earth.
I've gotta worry
about protecting myself.
I will tell you
when you take me back to your fleet.
I love you.
About time.
Hey there, Mr. Prez.
Heard you're here.
Temple of Aurora.
On Earth.
At least the way Pythia described it.
We'll get there.
Walk those halls together.
Yeah, pretty to think so.
This Roslin's stuff?
- It's weird for them to not be here.
- No one sits in his chair.
Tigh can't even look at it.
You know, the scariest thing my mom
used to tell me when I was a kid,
it's "your father is waiting for you
in the study."
I'd knock on the door.
Make the long walk across the room.
To that desk.
You know,
Leoben said something to me when
he was holding me
in that doll house on New Caprica.
That children
are born to replace their parents.
For children to reach their full
potential, parents have to die.
We rejoin your fleet
in less than an hour.
Then we will return
your Final Five to you.
Four.
There are four in your fleet.
Four?
- Where's the Fifth?
- I want the four in your fleet.
It'd be easier
if you just tell us who they are.
- Easier because you could kill them.
- Why would we do that?
They know the way to Earth.
We need them.
She's right. We all want the same thing.
If we cooperate...
We cooperated on New Caprica, brother.
It didn't work out well.
I'm going to hold your people hostage
until the Final Four
are safely aboard this ship.
You need to stand down, Bill.
Come on.
Trust me.
Stand down.
Pass the word.
Stack arms.
I've already had an Eight
prepare a Raptor,
so we'll launch
as soon as we come out of the jump.
Admiral,
you'll be coming along with me
to Galactica.
- I'm not going.
- Bill, go.
If the Cylons get the Four,
they get Earth.
You can't let this happen.
Even if you do blow this ship to hell.
Godsdamn it.
I got it, Felix.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Mr. Gaeta, do you wish to be relieved?
Good to go.
Dradis contact.
Incoming, bearing 1-8-5,
carom 2-niner-niner at 1700.
- What do we got?
- Cylon baseship.
Another contact, same bearing.
It's a Raptor.
Our people are back, sir.
Maybe she won't be able to identify us.
Gods, it's good to have you back.
It's good to be home.
The goods news is that your president,
Laura Roslin, is alive and well,
as are your crewmates.
She wants the Four Cylons
that are in this fleet.
She's gonna hold our people hostage
until she gets them.
You don't have to do anything
except stay out of the way.
I'm already in contact with them.
Now that they realize
there's nothing to fear
and that we only want to love
and protect them,
they should find a way of joining us.
I ask that you don't interfere with
any of the shuttle traffic in the fleet.
So your plan
is you take these four Cylons
and then you head off to Earth,
leaving us behind.
Now that's up to them.
All right.
If these four Cylons
want to come to you,
they're free to do so.
I will not stop them.
Do you agree, Admiral?
Agreed.
Well, then I will await them
on the baseship.
Laura Roslin needs her medication.
And I need to make sure
that she's all right.
- I'm gonna go with them.
- No.
We can't give them any more hostages.
The Colonel's right.
I served under Roslin for two years.
My place is by her side.
Another hostage
isn't gonna change the equation.
All right, go.
Thank you.
I backed your play, and now what?
Starbuck goes to work on a plan
to get our people back by force.
If we can't stop the Cylons
from reaching the baseship,
Laura Roslin wants it destroyed.
Half our guys are over there.
It's your call, Mr. President.
Roslin's right.
We lose those four, we lose Earth.
If everything goes South,
we destroy the baseship
and everyone on it.

The prisoners were here,
but D'Anna must know
you brought me in on this.
If she's moved the prisoners, it'll mean
a compartment by compartment fight.
And if they open fire on
the civilian fleet while we're boarding?
They could wipe out
the human race right there and then.
We need our Raptors are out there
with their nukes cocked and locked.
There's gotta be other options.
Yeah, those frakkin' Four
could give themselves up.
Brothers and sisters,
this is a great day for us.
One of our lost siblings has arrived.
She's one of the Final Five?
I saw her in my vision.
Now she's come home.
Laura...
There's been something
I've been meaning to say to you.
I wanted to thank you.
For what?
Essentially for not murdering me.
That can't have been
an easy decision to make.
But I love living.
I love living, and I wanted to thank you
for saving my life.
I wouldn't...
be so grateful if I were you.
You should know that I told the Admiral
that if D'Anna doesn't back down,
he should blow the ship to pieces.
- You what?
- She's in here.
Madam President.
Gaius.
Tory.
Sit down.
I brought you your medication.
Oh, my Gods.
- How did you do that?
- I came back with D'Anna.
To be with my people.
Because you're one of the Five.
You're one of the Final Five.
D'Anna saw her.
In a vision.
I knew it.
Maybe not on a conscious level,
but subconsciously,
I always knew there was something.
You had no idea.
Did you?
No.
Might be worth pondering
what else you've been wrong about.
Tory, wait.
You're right.
I'm wrong.
Okay.
You are one of the revered Final Five,
and as such,
the Cylons will listen to you.
Is that not right?
So, Tory,
please
go to D'Anna and
try to convince her to back down
and release all the hostages.
I'm done taking orders from you.
<i>Mr. President,
there has been a change of plans.</i>
<i>I've just executed the first
of the colonial hostages.</i>
<i>Another will follow every quarter hour
until our people come home.</i>
All right, listen to me.
You're not giving us a chance.
We are cooperating.
She terminated the transmission.
All right then, Admiral,
you're a go for the rescue mission.
If it fails...
destroy the baseship.
Yes, Mr. President.
All right,
put these pilots in their cockpits.
Check all systems,
and let's put these birds in the tubes.
Got it, Chief.
There you go.
APU won't spin up.
There's gotta be a short,
and damned if I can find it.
But I set some guys tracking on it...
Galen, you with me?
You all know that we have a baseship
out there with our people on it.
It is our job to get them back alive.
So speed is the only thing
we have on our side.
They're no doubt expecting us
to try for a breakout,
so we have to get in under
their reaction time, which is damn fast.
Raptor flights two and six
under Athena
will be our breaching force...
What's the matter?
I'm hearing it again.
All right.
Anyone know what the frak
we're doing here?
I don't know. I just felt compelled.
- Something about this Viper.
- Like what?
You checked every rivet and washer
on that bird, and you didn't find squat.
Yeah, well, something brought us here.
Something's changed.
I just don't know what it is.
Maybe Kara can help.
She flew this thing to Earth and back.
Go find her. See what she can tell you.
But hurry up.
A lot of good people are gonna die.
So where are you going?
Bill, you gotta scrub this mission.
What the hell are you doing here?
You're supposed to be in the CIC.
The Cylons will kill
every godsdamn hostage
before we put one pair of boots
aboard their ship.
Laura Roslin
will be the next to die, Bill.
I'm looking for options. You got one?
Yeah.
I should've told you
when I first found out,
but I didn't have the guts.
What's wrong with you, Saul?
Remember back at the nebula
when I told you
about that frakkin' music?
I thought it was in the ship.
I was wrong.
It was a signal.
Some kind of crazy,
frakked-up Cylon signal
switched me on.
I can't turn it off.
Switched you on.
Like Boomer.
I'm one of the Five.
- The Five.
- One of the Cylons D'Anna's after.
Quit frakkin' with me.
Colonel, I've known you for 30 years.
I told you.
I didn't find out until the nebula.
Think about this.
When I met you, you had hair.
I never heard of a Cylon aging.
Doesn't mean they don't.
Before the attack on the colonies,
we didn't know skinjobs existed.
Turns out there's another kind of Cylon
we didn't know about,
and I'm one of them.
On New Caprica, you were in captivity.
They did something to you.
They... An implant,
a post-hypnotic suggestion
that makes you feel this way.
- Let's go talk to doc Cottle.
- Listen to me!
It is not a delusion.
It is not a chip in my head.
I am a Cylon.
I've fooled you for months now.
I didn't want to, but I did.
Get your hands off of me.
If I had the guts to airlock myself
when I first found out,
we wouldn't be in this mess.
But that's the way out.
Not this suicidal attack.
I am one of the Final Five.
D'Anna will back down if you threaten
to flush me out an airlock.
Okay.
Dad.
Dad, listen.
No one suspected.
No one.
Not with his record,
what he did on New Caprica.
His eye, what happened to his wife...
Come on, let's get up.
What have I done? All the people
I've sent to die.
For what?
For what?
For Earth.
There is no Earth.
It's a frakkin' joke. There is no Earth.
Okay, dad,
listen to me. Listen to me!
Pull it together.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Come on.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
I can't kill him.
I can't kill the bastard. I can't.
Okay, okay, dad.
It's... it's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
I'll take care of it.
I can't.
I'll take care of it.
You mother-frakker.
Who are the others?
Where's the old man?
Right where you put him.
<i>Mr. President,</i>
<i>it's the CIC.</i>
<i>D'Anna's on the line.</i>
- This is the president.
- <i>Mr. President...</i>
- You're running out of time.
- <i>No, you are.</i>
<i>It's your turn to listen.</i>
If you harm another one of my people,
you so much as blacken one of their eyes
and I flush Saul Tigh
out of the launch tube.
We have no wish for further bloodshed.
May I speak with the Admiral?
No, you deal with me.
You have 10 minutes to release my people
or you can kiss one
of your precious Final Five good-bye.
You want to save the fleet,
I need the others, and I need them now.
It's sitting here the same way
it has been for months.
What made you think
something was happening?
Hard to explain.
You know, it's just a feeling.
Yeah, I've got a feeling too.
You're both out of your frakkin' minds.
You had a feeling you could find Earth.
I trusted you.
I backed you every step of the way.
Now I need you to trust ours.
Ensign Anders.
Specialist Tyrol.
Slowly put your hands on your heads
and face the Viper.
Do it now!
What the hell is going on?
They're Cylons, just like the XO.
Sam.
Go ahead.
It's true, Kara.
There's something different
about this Viper.
Something's changed. You gotta find it.
Shut up.
Fall back!
Fall back!
- Where the hell are you taking us?
- Keep moving.
- Otherwise, we shoot you here.
- No!
This is a wild guess.
You told them.
We should've done it day one.
Get the baseship on the horn.
Mr. Hoshi, we need the baseship.
- What's going on?
- D'Anna's gonna execute more hostages.
- Okay, take me to D'Anna.
- No, she won't listen to you.
I was with her in the temple when she
had the vision of the Five... Take me.
He's right. Take him, it's good.
Are you ready to come to your senses,
Mr. President?
<i>Galen Tyrol and Samuel Anders have just
joined Saul Tigh in the airlock.</i>
They found them.
They're in line
for an express ride into a vacuum.
You want them alive,
stand down.
I know Lee.
Press him and he'll back down.
Target our nuclear weapons
on the civilian fleet.
We'll see if he wants to play hardball.
D'Anna.
Gaius.
Coercion won't work with Lee Adama.
- He's too similar to his father.
- Lee's bluffing.
He's doesn't give a tinker's damn
about those three,
not now.
You push him, he'll kill them.
Then the entire human race
will die with them.
Mr. President,
the baseship nukes just went hot.
If any of our fleet
starts spooling up...
They won't have time to jump
before the Cylons fire.
<i>Sergeant Harder,
clear the tube of everyone but Tigh.</i>
Corporal.
Do you really think God brought you back
from the darkness for this, D'Anna?
Maybe he brought you back
for a different purpose.
To end this peacefully.
They will never forgive us for what
we did to the Twelve Colonies, never.
Proceed.
Brute force did not work for you
on New Caprica.
It didn't work for you
on the algae planet.
So why is it gonna work for you now?
Give me the key.
We have weapons lock on their ships.
What are you waiting for, Apollo?
Do it.
Lee, stop! Stop!
Stop!
Those three frakkin' Cylons
just gave us Earth.
Well, it's a colonial
emergency locator signal.
And no other wireless
in the fleet is picking this up?
Gaeta's confirmed it.
The channel's empty
except for this Viper.
It's gotta be a signal from Earth.
You're reaching, Kara.
Come on, Lee, add it up.
I vanish into a storm.
Ride this Viper to Earth.
Coming back, I get a vision
that leads me to the baseship.
Its hybrid tells me that the Final Five
Cylons have been to Earth,
but we need the missing three,
D'Anna, to bring them out into the open.
And now we're starting to get messages
from the beyond.
You heard the signal.
The final Cylons led me to it.
If it's Earth, they've given us
the home of the Thirteenth Tribe
just the way the hybrid said
it would happen.
Like it or not, Lee,
something's orchestrating this
for a purpose.
A higher power.
Call it whatever you want,
but it seems to want us
to find Earth with the Cylons.
One tiny needle in the whole fleet.
Well, you're right. It's wafer thin.
It's the best I could do
at short notice.
So you're all in agreement
this is the way to Earth?
It's a stretch,
but it's the best explanation we've got.
Which is why we chose
to share this information with you.
We could've jumped away with it,
left you behind.
But that would've led to another
confrontation, another stand-off.
- All this has happened before...
- But it doesn't have to happen again.
Not if we make up our minds to change.
Take a different path.
Right here, right now.
You were afraid we'd kill these four,
and yet, here they are,
standing right behind you.
Free to go.
Or stay.
I've granted them an amnesty.
So the question is,
where do we go from here?
All right.
I'll release your crew.
We go to Earth together.
We've projected a course
toward the signal.
It'll probably take
some revising as we go, but...
this is our destination right here.
Earth.
So...
What are your orders, Admiral?
Orders?
Are you ready
to take us to our new home?
I don't know.
You don't know what?
What don't you know about?
It's good to see you.
Bill...
This is it.
This is it.
This is everything
that we have been working for.
I want to see you
pick up that first fistful of Earth.
Come on.
I'll be back.
I see.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Anyway, I'm glad to see you again,
Madam President.
And so is the Quorum.
And I guess I just finished the shortest
presidency in colonial history.
Yes, well,
don't look so relieved, Mr. Adama.
Because you were dealt a crisis
and you knew exactly what to do.
You faced it boldly.
This fleet is going to need
that kind of leadership
in the days to come,
so you are not off the hook yet.
Thank you.
You guys just gonna sit here flapping
your lips or are we gonna go find Earth?
Kara and I have been working
on a recon plan...
Frak it.
This is the end of the line.
We've got nowhere else to go.
And if we give the alliance
too much time, it'll fall apart again.
Gotta roll the hard six.
We all go together.
As fast as we can.
Yes, sir.
Fleet in jump formation. Standing by.
Board is green.
Ship reports ready to jump, Admiral.
Very well.
Madam President,
without you,
we wouldn't have made it.
Give the order.
It's been a long time coming.
Okay.
Take us to Earth.
In five,
four,
three,
two,
one,
jump.
Jump complete.
Dradis is clear.
Fleet is checking in.
Nav.
- Confirming position.
- Take your time.
Get it right.
Fleet all present and accounted for.
Visible constellations are a match.
Crew of Galactica...
People of the fleet...
<i>This is Admiral Adama.</i>
<i>Three years ago,
I promised to lead you to a new home.</i>
<i>We've endured a difficult journey.</i>
<i>We've all lost, we've all suffered,</i>
<i>and the truth is</i>
<i>I questioned
whether this day would ever come.</i>
<i>But today, our journey is at an end.</i>
<i>We have arrived...</i>
at Earth.
We made it, kid.
We did it.
You did it.
Earth.
- =( Team Lords of Kobol )= -
<i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
I don't know
what to make of you and me.
I'm having trouble
- accepting this.
- We have to push forward.
Keep the fleet together.
Find Earth.
3,600 years ago,
Pythia wrote about the exile
and the rebirth of the human race.
And the Lords anointed a leader
to guide the caravan of the heavens
to their new homeland.
I came back with D'Anna
to be with my people.
Because you're one of the Five.
You're one of the Final Five.
Turns out there's another kind of Cylon
we didn't know about,
- and I'm one of them.
- Corporal!
Get it out of my sight!
Put your hands on your heads
and face the Viper. Do it now!
- What the hell is going on?
- They're Cylons.
There's something different
about this Viper. Something's changed.
You gotta find it.
That's a colonial
emergency locator signal.
So you're all in agreement
this is the way to Earth?
It's a stretch,
but it's the best explanation we've got.
So the question is,
where do we go from here?
We go to Earth together.
Earth.
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-
Admiral.
Our scouts say the same
all over the planet.
No answers to our hails.
No signs of human life.
It's the same report
we got from ours.
This signal's pretty weak.
The emergency locator battery
must be running low on juice.
It was probably on for a long time.
Low level radiation.
Definitely in the water
and the food chain.
Put word out not to eat or drink
anything down here.
Baltar just confirmed it. The planet
was nuked about 2,000 years ago.
It squares with what our teams
have been finding all over the planet.
It's perfect.
We traded one nuked civilization
for another.
Let's get out of here.
Just don't give up.
Just don't give up.
Don't fall apart.
Easy, Dee.
Take it easy.
Get me out of here.
Madam President!
Is Earth really a wasteland?
Is there anything at all?
The president will be making
a statement in due course.
You will find out everything
in good time.
It's colonial.
It's standard on all aircraft.
Part of our inertial nav system.
"757-NC."
Kara, what is it?
What does it mean?
The number on my ship is 8757-NC.
- I'm gonna get her!
- Hello!
No, stop!
I'm gonna go into the table!
Raptor's down!
Appreciate it, Dee.
You kidding?
I look forward to this.
I look forward to this.
We'll be back soon, okay?
Thanks, Dee. Bye, baby!
You have no idea
what's happened, do you?
Today is just another day.
Hey, over here!
What is it?
We found a couple of these
scattered among the bones
in sites around the planet.
Centurions.
Similar,
but they're not one of ours.
We've never seen this design.
So the Thirteenth Tribe settled here
and created their own Cylons.
And then the machines rose up
and killed their masters.
That's what we thought.
Until we tested the bones.
250 skeletons so far.
From four different sites
on the planet.
- Using our protocols...
- The results are conclusive.
- What's your point?
- They're not human.
They're Cylon.
All of 'em?
All of them.
The Thirteenth Tribe was Cylon.
The Thirteenth Tribe,
the tribe of Cylons,
came to this planet
and called it Earth.
Madam President,
what do we do about the Quorum?
You need to talk to them.
We need to tell them something.
It should come from their president.
Carry the ball.
Bill, we need to talk.
There's a lot of things
I gotta explain.
If my Viper's splattered all over
this planet, then who flew it here?
And what the hell
did I fly back to Galactica?
Maybe it's better off not knowing.
You're always telling me to face
the truth and not run from it.
Why the sudden change of heart?
I've got a feeling...
- You might not like what you find.
- For me or you?
There you are.
The Raptor's ready to take you
back to Colonial One.
What are you doing in here?
I was just thinking.
About all the pilots
who sat in those seats.
Gave their lives for a dream
of a new beginning on Earth.
I don't want their sacrifice
to be meaningless.
You've got that look again.
What look?
The one you had when your father
took Galactica back to New Caprica.
We stayed behind on Pegasus
with the civilian fleet.
You thought
you'd never see him again.
That easy to read, huh?
Just to me.
There were some good times for us,
weren't there,
on Pegasus?
Yeah.
I remember what you told me.
We had to keep the human race going.
And you did.
No, we did.
I couldn't have done
it without you, Dee.
You will this time, too.
I don't know how.
I don't know what the frak
I'm gonna tell the Quorum.
Good news is...
Real estate prices are low.
Truth is, there is no happy way
to spin this thing.
So don't.
Tell them the truth.
That's what people need to hear,
and they need to hear it from you.
If anybody can give them
a reason to go on...
it's you,
Apollo.
Would you...
I was gonna grab
a drink around 19:00.
Would you join me?
It's a date.
Help me, godsdamn it!
If you've got an explanation for this,
now's the time.
I don't have one.
I was wrong.
About Earth.
Your hybrid...
told me something.
Said that I was the harbinger of death.
That I would lead us all to our end.
She told you that?
Is it true?
Is it true?
If that's me lying there,
then what am I?
What am I?
What am I?
"So let us not talk falsely now
"'cause the hour is getting late."
You remember something?
Yeah.
I used to live here.
Me too.
That song that switched us on?
I played it.
For a woman I loved.
I remember.
You do?
You played it for all of us.
That was me.
We died in a holocaust.
Then why are we still alive?
That happened 2,000 years ago.
How did we get to the colonies?
Come to think that we were human?
2,000 years
is a long time to forget.
We gotta do something.
Morale is going down the toilet.
What are you doing?
The pythian prophecy.
Cottle told me that you didn't show up
for your Doloxan treatment.
That's right.
Do you want to tell me why?
I didn't feel like it.
You're gonna reschedule.
I don't think so.
Laura, you need your treatments.
No, I don't.
What are you doing?
You just gonna...
lie down and quit?
- You made me believe in this.
- You shouldn't have listened to me.
When the Cylons first attacked,
you should've held your ground
and kept fighting.
Because I was wrong.
I was wrong about everything.
And all those people who listened,
and they trusted me,
and they followed me,
all those people...
They're dead.
- That's not...
- Don't, stop.
Don't touch me.
Just go.
Burn.
Burn.
Tell me again.
- You've heard it three times, Dee.
- I want to remember every word.
All right, I said,
"Ladies and gentlemen,
we now have a choice.
"We can either view this
as a catastrophe
"or an opportunity.
"I, Lee Adama...
"ex-acting president, former commander
of the obliterated Battlestar Pegasus,
"Apollo to my friends,
I choose the latter.
"We're no longer enslaved
by the ramblings of Pythia.
"No longer pecking at the breadcrumbs
of the Thirteenth Tribe.
"We are now free
to go where we want to go...
"and be who we want to be."
I'm so proud.
I think I managed
to stall a full scale panic,
but I got no idea what to do next.
That is the best fun I have had...
In a long, long time.
Thank you for that.
- What?
- You're glowing.
Am I?
All I can think of is
that waste of a planet.
Please.
I just want to hang on
to this feeling for as long as I can.
Look at that.
Little Anna's got her smile back.
Sometimes I don't even
remember that's me.
It's so long ago.
She has no frakkin' idea
what's ahead of her.
None of us do.
Oh, my gods, help!
No, no, no, it's gonna be okay.
- We need a medic.
- She's gonna be okay.
We need a medic here!
We need a medic!
Frak.
Medic!
She kissed me good night
45 minutes ago,
and there was...
joy in her eyes.
So tell me why would she do this?
I don't frakkin' know.
No.
What did you do?
I let you down.
I let everybody down.
- Give me your sidearm.
- Sir?
Frakkin' now!
- Leave it loaded.
- Yes, sir.
I think we should have that little
heart to heart you've been pining for.
Sit down, Cylon.
Looks like you've got
a head start on me, Bill.
And it looks like you still don't know
when to shut your frakkin' mouth
and follow orders.
Bill, I am so sorry
that I didn't have the guts
to tell you
when I first found out.
Frak you!
You got no guts.
You're a frakkin' machine.
Is that how it worked?
They program you to be my friend?
Emulate...
all the qualities I respect.
Tell me jokes...
and I'd laugh at them.
Bill...
I was your friend
because I chose to be.
I wanted to be.
Ah, Ellen.
Yeah, you know, Ellen was smarter
than I gave her credit for.
- Don't go there, Bill.
- Smarter than me.
She knew from the beginning
that there was something wrong with you.
That's why she went around
frakkin' half the colonial fleet.
- Shut your mouth!
- Searching out, trying to find a man
who had real blood
in his main vein.
Shut your frakkin' mouth!
She came on to me once.
Like a dog in heat, I could smell.
I could smell it...
she smelled so good.
Go on, do it, do it, do it!
Or I will.
Go on, go on.
Do it.
Go on.
Oh, my Gods.
That's why you came here.
To do this.
You haven't got the frakkin' guts
to do it yourself.
I'm sorry, Bill.
This is one time I can't help you.
I think we've both had enough.
Did I ever tell you
about my summers with my uncle
when I was a kid?
Foxes...
would attack his henhouse
all the time.
Really pissed him off.
He'd wake me up.
We'd go with his hounds
at night up into the hills
looking for the fox.
When the dogs smelled the scent,
they'd go crazy.
The pack would become a team.
Forced the fox...
toward the river.
So what would the foxes do?
Half would turn and fight.
The other half
would try to swim across.
But my uncle told me about
a few that...
They'd swim halfway out,
turn with the current,
and ride it all the way out to sea.
Fishermen would find them
a mile offshore just...
swimming.
Because they wanted to drown.
Maybe.
Or maybe they were just...
tired.
Well, godsdamn it, Bill.
We can't swim out to sea.
I am the XO of this ship.
You are the commanding officer.
How is putting a bullet in your head
gonna help Dee?
It is sure as frak
isn't gonna help all the others
who are thinking about doing
the same godsdamn thing.
And what are they gonna do
without the old man here
to lead them?
Lead them where, Saul?
I hear you lost the signal.
You couldn't find the source.
I need to talk. I've gotta...
tell somebody.
You look like hell.
What's going on?
What about Dee?
She shot herself.
My Gods.
I don't understand.
No, neither do I, you know.
I'm trying
to come up with a neat answer.
But truth is,
I'll never know.
'Cause it's too frakkin' late.
Mr. Hoshi.
Take over for
Lieutenant Dualla.
Mr. Gaeta.
Find me
the closest G, F or K class star system.
Get the Cylon baseship on the horn.
See if our new allies
want to come along for the ride.
Men and women of the fleet.
This is the admiral.
<i>The discoveries</i>
<i>of the past few days</i>
<i>have been painful for all of us.</i>
As you know,
we cannot stay on Earth.
<i>But this is not a new challenge.</i>
<i>The Thirteen tribes of Kobol</i>
<i>stood exactly on the same spot
that we are right now.</i>
<i>They experienced dreadful losses.</i>
<i>Their planet</i>
<i>was a graveyard.</i>
<i>They needed a home.</i>
<i>So they set out
in the void of deep space</i>
<i>with nothing but their ships
and their guts.</i>
<i>And the Thirteen</i>
<i>succeeded.</i>
<i>They weren't supermen.</i>
<i>They were ordinary people</i>
<i>like us.</i>
<i>What they can accomplish,</i>
<i>we can accomplish.</i>
<i>We will find a new home.</i>
<i>This is a promise</i>
<i>I intend to keep.</i>
All right, people, pack it up.
We're off this rock in 15 minutes.
You'd better get back to your ship.
The fleet is about to jump.
I'm not going.
You know, all this is just gonna happen
again and again and again.
So I'm getting off
this merry-go-round.
I'll die here with my ancestors,
and it beats the hell out of
being out there with Cavil.
Gonna die in the cold and the dark
when Cavil catches up with us.
Well, I wouldn't count
the old man out.
He'll find us a home.
Don't you ever want
to stop fighting it, colonel?
Don't you just want
to stop all of this?
And just ride the tide out to sea.
Saul!
I'll get you out!
It's okay.
It's okay.
Everything is in place.
We'll be reborn...
again.
Together.
Ellen, you're the Fifth.
<i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
Looks like Mommy's gonna get
some sleep tonight after all.
Stay the frak away from me!
I heard you. You're Cylons.
I know that you've been spending
a lot of time interrogating the Six.
I'm not torturing her,
if that's what you're worried about.
Cottle tells me she's pregnant.
You just gonna lie down and quit?
I was wrong about everything.
And all those people who listened
and trusted me,
they're dead.
We'll find a new home.
This is a promise
<i>I intend to keep.</i>
Get the Cylon baseship on the horn.
See if our new allies
want to come along for the ride.
"There is a languor of the life
"more imminent than pain.
"Tis pain's successor
"when the soul
has suffered all it can."
I don't see anything.
- Wait, I see something.
- Where?
Right there. Wait. No?
- I thought I saw it.
- Saw what?
Everyone shut the frak up
for a second.
- Got it. There.
- Yeah, there it is.
I see it.
I can see it!
My God, there it is.
It's so beautiful.
I still don't see anything.
Try looking with your eyes...
eye.
Here, Colonel.
See, this is the head,
shoulder, and there's a little hand.
I'll be damned.
It's our baby, Saul.
Our baby.
I need a drink.
Here, next best thing.
That's a lot of smoking
around a pregnant lady.
She'll live.
Look at that, Saul.
Do you know what that is, really?
That's the future
of the entire Cylon race.
Kid doesn't even have a name yet and
already loading up on the expectations.
All he has to do is be born.
No Cylon/Cylon pairing
has ever produced a child ever.
Believe me, it's been tried.
That means it's...
That means it's possible for our race
to survive even without resurrection.
The Cylon nation will survive.
Ishay,
get me the fetal monitor. I want to
work up a complete biophysical profile
on this... savior.
Sorry, Felix.
He's backed up today,
but he shouldn't be much longer.
No problem. At least
the Cylons are having fun, right?
Earth's a cinder. Dee's dead.
Suicides are up. Fleet's a mess.
President's missing in action,
but, gotta make sure
the Cylons are taken care of.
Rub this into the skin and it'll help
with the drying and the chaffing,okay?
No, no, frak. I've gone through
two jars of that stuff already.
It doesn't do anything.
The end cap needs to be refitted.
I already told him it's too high
on one side, but he won't listen.
I'm sorry, Felix.
I'm really sorry.
I will get you in there
as soon as I can. It's just been crazy.
I need help!
I need help!
- It's busy today, chief.
- He's peeing blood.
It's gonna be awhile.
get him to bed three.
I'll go and get a Doctor.
- Sorry.
- No problem.
- Ishay, where's the damn fetal monitor?
- Can't keep those toasters waiting.
Right.
Admiral! Admiral!
Is Colonel Tigh still serving
as executive officer,
and aren't you concerned about
having a Cylon as second in command?
I'm not gonna discuss
military protocol or chain of command.
Is it true you're contemplating forming
a permanent alliance
with the rebel Cylons
currently in this fleet?
I'm not gonna talk
about hypotheticals.
Mr. Vice President,
would you support such a move?
No comment.
Serious! Unbelievable!
Where is President Roslin?
Thank you, Playa.
The President is resting comfortably
aboard Galactica.
Last question.
Yes, Seku.
Do you have any information
on the identity of the fifth Cylon?
We believe
the fifth Cylon to be dead.
But you're not sure.
No, but we believe
she died some time ag...
- She?
- How do you know it was a woman?
That was the last question.
Thank you all very much for coming.
- I can't believe I said that.
- What was that about?
- Forget about it.
- Permanent alliance between
this government and the Cylons,
any Cylons, Is out of the question.
- I hope you both know that.
- Yeah, it's not your call.
Is it yours?
Are you the President again?
Sorry, I get confused
what your job is on any given day.
Laura Roslin is still the President.
She'll make the final call.
And where is Laura Roslin?
That's right.
Resting comfortably aboard Galactica.
Funny how she dropped out of sight
ever since her prophecies about Earth
turned out to be a bunch of crap.
We're done here.
If you try to shove an alliance
with the Cylons down our throats,
there'll be consequences, Admiral.
I promise you.
Thank you, Mr. Zarek.
Makes it a little bit easier
to know who to hold responsible
if there's an unfortunate incident.
I'm not hard to find, Admiral.
I'm right here...
Running the government.
For now.
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-
The feeling on the baseship is
we'd rather take our chances with you
than risk running
into Cavil's forces alone.
- We?
- Yeah.
We... Cylons.
That description fit
anyone around here you know?
Have this discussion another time.
What about the FTL question?
It's possible.
It's labor-intensive,
a lot of grunt work,
but we should be able to upgrade
all the jump drives in the entire fleet
with Cylon technology.
Not gonna be easy
to sell the Quorum on this one.
Frak the Quorum.
These are civilian ships.
What are you gonna do?
Upgrade their engines at gunpoint?
We need the Quorum
to get civilian cooperation.
All right.
What'll it take
to get the Quorum to sign off?
The first issue is gonna be
whether we can make these upgrades
with Galactica personnel only.
It's one thing to accept
Cylon technology.
It's quite another to have
actual Cylons aboard their ships.
I barely understand this stuff,
and I'm...
We are gonna need teams
of Sharons and Sixes,
possibly Leobens,
just to do the installations.
- They'll go nuts.
- We gotta sell 'em on it.
Point out the benefits.
Athena tells me the upgrades
should triple the fleet's jump capacity.
Absolutely.
And that's conservative.
Their technology...
Our technology
is way ahead of ours...
Yours.
Maybe you'd like a chart
to keep it all straight.
- What do you think?
- Well...
Tripling jump capacity
triples our chances
of finding a habitable planet
before we run out of food and fuel.
- That I might be able to sell.
- What's the catch?
Because there is a catch, right,
former-chief?
We want to be part of the fleet.
Not just along for the ride.
Full members, citizens,
seat at the Quorum, the whole thing.
- Are you insane?
- It's non-negotiable.
You want Cylon technology.
We want safety
in case Cavil's forces arrive.
Now, if we're citizens,
your oath...
states that you protect us
just like everybody else.
And the other Cylons,
they really think
that that will guarantee your safety?
Yes, they do.
I've convinced them the Admiral takes
these sorts of things very seriously.
That he would rather lose the fleet
than break the oath.
Unlike certain other people.
Unlike certain other people.
I understand the argument.
It makes sense
from their perspective.
You're not seriously
thinking about this.
Sir.
You're not seriously
thinking about this, sir.
All options are on the table,
Mr. Gaeta.
This is a political decision.
I'll have to run it
by the President.
Thank you all.
Admiral, can I have a word?
Acute renal failure.
I think we caught it in time
to manage with dialysis.
However, there is a chance
that this could lead
to chronic renal failure.
And if that happens,
he's gonna lose a kidney.
What's the next step? What do I do?
Do I give some blood?
Build up a supply?
We have enough of his type
in the blood bank.
He's half-Cylon.
You got a lot of half-Cylon blood
just lying around, do you?
No, you're right.
I hadn't thought about that.
We should tap a vein
and start a supply right away.
This is ridiculous,
you have to tell him.
Tell me what?
This little boy could die.
- His father should know.
- Ishay, zip it!
What the hell is she talking about?
We'll talk about this later.
I guess you better come with me.
Hey, buddy. How's it going?
All right.
This is gonna be a shock.
But I want you to know
that I was bound
by Doctor-patient confidentiality
in this.
Even though she's dead now,
it's still applied.
Cally?
You're talking about Cally.
What the frak does she...
I'm not his father, am I?
I'm sorry.
She found out she was pregnant
just before you got married.
She wasn't sure
that you were the father.
She wanted me
to terminate the pregnancy.
The procedure is illegal,
but there are ways around it.
However, she decided to keep it.
Then later on she asked me
to do a paternity test
because she wanted to know.
And it wasn't me.
Who?
He doesn't know either.
And I'll be damned if he's gonna
find out that he's a father
from a pissed-off former deck chief
with a Cylon chip on his shoulder.
No, I'll have to tell him.
I'll tell him, and then the two of you
can work it out on your own.
Take care of him.
Great.
You know the President's stopped
returning my calls.
She's going through a rough patch.
We all are.
She'll get through it.
Just take time.
But we're gonna need to know
her stance on this citizenship thing
sooner rather than later.
I'll talk to you about it later.
Get me the President.
If we can sway public
opinion towards us...
Or, at least not against us...
He thinks that Zarek
and the Quorum can be handled.
He's probably right.
I'm so stiff.
- Are you sure you're up for this?
- Yeah, just...
I'm just stretching,
a little aerobics.
Truth is, I haven't felt
this good in months.
It hurts, but it's good.
When do you have to go in
for another Doloxan treatment?
Tomorrow.
Good.
Lee thinks, and I agree with him,
that you should address the fleet.
Make a public declaration
that an alliance with the Cylons
is critical
for our long-term survival.
Sure. Not just yet, though.
I need a little time.
That's what I told him.
We need you, Laura.
I know that you're tired,
but we need you.
I hear you.
I do, trust me.
I need a little time.
Go.
Go.
- Just don't overdo it, all right?
- I won't.
Captain Thrace.
Whatever it is,
I'm not in the mood, Felix.
Oh, so you think I should
give a frak about your mood.
Okay, let's have it.
- You tried to throw me out an airlock.
- Still crying about that?
The charges at the time were
collaborating with an enemy
in a time of war.
Waiting for the punch line.
It turns out the jury
that convicted me was made
of two Cylons
and a woman married to a Cylon.
Rim shot!
Big laugh, applause,
applause, applause.
Are we done?
Oh, no, wait. I'm sorry, I forgot.
We haven't gotten to the leg yet.
50 billion people are dead, and I'm
supposed to give a frak about your leg?
Who killed those 50 billion people?
- It wasn't me.
- No, it was your husband.
Are you enjoying yourself?
Is this how you get
your kicks these days?
Oh wait, I'm sorry.
I meant half-kicks.
What was Sam doing on Caprica
before he so conveniently met you?
You ever wonder?
You think maybe he...
nuked a few cities?
Executed a few thousand prisoners?
I'm just wondering.
Well, then again,
maybe you're a Cylon too.
At least I'm not a gimp.
One day, one day soon,
there's gonna be a reckoning, Kara.
And once again people are gonna
have to answer for what they've done.
Is that a threat?
You're godsdamn right
that's a threat.
Well, you know
where to find me, Felix.
And in case you're wondering,
I will definitely hit a cripple.
Or anyone else.
So I guess a pity frak's
out of the question then?
Somebody close that hatch.
Let's talk.
Point of order!
Point of order, please!
The chair exercises its right
to bring a motion forward.
In prison,
you start to confuse
your hopes and dreams
with reality.
You start to...
believe that because
you want something to happen...
parole, a pardon, appeal, a writ...
you start to believe
that it will happen.
You live on wishes.
The way things should be,
instead of the way they are.
And all because
you can't face reality.
The leaders of this fleet are
succumbing to wishful thinking
because they can't face reality.
And the reality is
that the Roslin-Adama administration
has led us nowhere.
Earth was a mirage,
a fantasy they dangled
in front of us for four long years
in order to maintain power.
A fantasy they dreamed up
as a way to hold on and control
the government
over the democratic
wishes of the population.
So now
what is our feckless
and dispirited leadership doing
to solidify their position
after failing us so miserably?
Turning to the Cylons.
The Cylons...
For help.
Aren't the Cylons the reason
we're out here in the first place?
Aren't they the enemy?
Or are they suddenly our friends
if that helps keep
Roslin-Adama in power?
Point of order. The chair needs
to bring a motion, not make a speech.
Thank you, Mr. Adama.
The chair moves that any decision
on allowing Cylons
to board any ship in this fleet
be made by the Captain
and the people living on that ship,
and not the Roslin-Adama
administration.
What we need right now is unity.
This is a fleet-wide issue.
We need to stand together.
It affects all of us.
Sagittaron calls the question.
Tauron seconds.
Question has been called and seconded.
All in favor?
All opposed?
Vote is 11 to 1.
Motion carries.
No Cylon will board a ship
in this fleet
without permission of its people.
Thank you.
What?
Mother-frakkin' son of a...
It's a big ship.
- You ran the whole route?
- Half.
It's more than I've run in...
a long time.
You're flushed.
- You look good.
- Thank you.
You're not supposed to look good.
You're supposed to be in sickbay
with a tube in your arm.
Changed my mind.
Like hell.
You never intended to go.
Caught.
Send me to the brig.
I can run there.
Cottle says you're experiencing
a moment of euphoria
as your body recovers
from the toxicity of the treatments.
So much
for Doctor-patient confidentiality.
Well, the President's health
is a security issue.
My resignation
will be on your desk in the hour.
I'm not gonna hand
the presidency over to Tom Zarek.
- Then the status quo will have to do.
- Stop it.
Listen, we need you.
Zarek's got the Quorum in an uproar.
The press is going crazy.
The government
is spinning out of control.
Now...
we need you.
Take your hands off me, Bill.
I've played my role in this farce.
"A dying leader
will guide the people to the...
"blah-blah-blah frakkin...
"blah-blah."
I've been there. I've done that.
Now what?
Is there another role
that I have to play
for the rest of my life?
Do you remember
what we said on new Caprica?
How we talked about trying
to live for today?
Well, you better think about that,
because...
maybe tomorrow really isn't coming.
Maybe today is all we have left.
And maybe...
Just maybe...
I've earned
the right to live a little
before I die.
Haven't I?
What do you think?
Haven't I?
Yes, you've earned it.
I have.
Well, guess what.
So have you.
Now get out of my way.
What manner of forgiveness
are you seeking?
Is it that of disobedient children?
Are you children?
Well, obviously you're a child.
We have some children here,
but to the rest of you,
in your mind's eye,
are you all just children
who've transgressed
- against your father's divine will?
- No.
We've done nothing wrong.
Are you being punished
for your multitude of sins?
- Are you?
- No.
Is this really our lot?
To have been led...
by a father...
to the promised land.
No. We shouldn't have to suffer.
- Just keep talking.
- To paradise...
Only to have paradise
cruelly smashed
to bits before our very eyes?
Are these the actions of a father
- towards his children?
- No.
It's not right.
What have you done?
What have you done
to deserve this punishment?
What sins have you committed?
<i>What dark thoughts have you harbored
that condemn you?</i>
Condemn you...
to wander through the universe
without hope?
Without light?
So you have to ask yourself
what kind of a father
abandons his own children
to despair and loneliness?
No father!
Perhaps we are not
the ones in need of forgiveness.
Perhaps we're not.
Perhaps we have been wronged!
Yes, we have!
Perhaps it is God
who should come down here
and beg for our forgiveness?
Am I right?
Am I right?
Well, shout it to God!
What have you done for me lately?
Where have you been?
There is a disease aboard this ship,
and it is a disease of denial!
Am I right? Well, don't tell me!
Shout it to God!
Cottle told me. I didn't know.
We need to... We should talk.
Get off me!
It's a godsdamn uprising.
I don't think we're there yet,
but we do have a problem.
A problem? Ten of our ships refuse
a direct order from the flagship.
- Another 12 won't respond to our hails.
- They're not doing anything illegal.
The Quorum gave them the right to refuse
any Cylon or Cylon technology aboard.
Jump drive upgrades
is a military decision
outside of the authority
of the Quorum.
And you alone get to make
that determination?
Yes, Mr. Gaeta.
I get to make that determination.
You have a problem with that?
Admiral, we're in receipt
of an emergency signal
from our marine commander
aboard the Hitei Kan.
The crew of the tylium ship
has mutinied.
They killed a Cylon and two marines.
Scramble the mardet alert team
and launch the assault Raptor.
<i>This is the XO.
Scramble the mardet alert team.</i>
<i>Mutiny aboard Hitei Kan.</i>
Admiral, tylium ship
is pulling out of formation,
spinning up their FTL drives.
I want to talk to whoever's
in charge of that ship right now.
Hitei Kan,
this is Galactica. Please respond.
This is a priority signal
from Galactica actual to the...
current commander of your ship.
Their drives are spooled up.
- Where's my assault team?
- Raptor's launching now.
<i>Galactica, Athena.</i>
We've cleared the bay
and are <i>en route</i> to Hitei Kan.
<i>Hitei Kan, this is Galactica.
Please respond.</i>
- Mr. Hoshi!
- I'm trying, but they're not...
Wait.
They're communicating
with Colonial One.
Roslin?
Can't be. She's aboard Galactica.
Let's hear it.
<i>The dradis!</i>
<i>The dradis shows a Raptor
and Vipers heading straight for us.</i>
<i>- They'll be here any minute.
- They have no right to board your ship</i>
<i>without your permission.</i>
Son of a bitch.
<i>What should we do,
Mr. Vice President?</i>
<i>Every citizen has the right
to protect themselves from oppression.</i>
<i>Take whatever measures
you think necessary.</i>
She jumped.
Hitei Kan has jumped away, sir.
Taking all our fuel with them.
You know, there are days
that I really hate this job.
Put me on scramble.
Athena.
Galactica actual.
I read you, actual.
<i>You're ordered to board
the Colonial One.</i>
<i>Locate and arrest
the Vice President,</i>
then bring him back to Galactica.
Roger that, actual.
Arrest and return to Galactica.
What are my orders if he resists?
In that case,
<i>the use of deadly force
is authorized.</i>
I don't know anything
about being a father.
It sucks.
Except for the parts that don't.
All right.
First lesson in parenting.
Sit.
Your kid's in the hospital,
you never leave him alone,
no matter what.
Someone's always here.
You get first shift...
Dad.
Wait.
How long do I sit here?
Until I get back.
That'll be after I sober up.
Sworn statements.
Transcripts of wireless conversations.
Shipping records.
All kinds of documents really.
Compiled over the last year
with one theme.
The buying and the selling
of the Vice President's office.
So this is a...
conversation about extortion.
About law and order.
But you can call it what you want.
You see, I believe that...
you would walk happily
to the gallows
or languish in a cell
for the rest of your life,
if you could do it as a...
martyr to your cause.
But the idea of being...
publicly humiliated,
as a corrupt politician
with your hand in the till.
Well, that would scare you.
Somehow I don't think
that the legend and the myth
of Tom Zarek, the political prisoner
and a man of conscience,
can survive the airing
of that much dirty laundry.
You really think the fleet
is going to sit still
for a long
and politically motivated trial
while you make an alliance
with the Cylons?
I think without the tylium ship,
we're not going anywhere.
We're gonna sit here
for a long time.
At least we won't be bored.
You think I know
where the tylium ship is?
- Yes, I do.
- Why?
Because I know that you do.
Read the file.
Some juicy stuff.
Make a great story for the press.
Murder and extortion.
You know what the difference is
between you and I, Admiral?
You wear that uniform
and I don't.
You can cool your heels here
until I check these out.
I wouldn't eat the food.
- Here's our tylium ship.
- That was fast. How did you do it?
I appealed to his intellect.
- Should I send in a medic?
- No, he's fine.
You're not. You should see a medic.
You look like hell.
I feel like it too. I need to rest.
You earned it.
Let me know when they find the ship.
I'll be with the President.
You got it.
Give this to Hoshi.
Tell him to file it.
Laundry reports?
<i>Hitei Kan, this is Athena.</i>
Stand by to be boarded.
Any resistance will be met with force.
This is your only warning.
<i>Understood.</i>
Every revolution
begins with one small act
of courage.
But I hope you know
how serious this is.
I hope you understand that this
will have consequences.
Deadly consequences.
For a lot of people.
I've thought about the consequences.
I'm ready.
We all are.
How many is "we"?
Enough.
But once it starts,
we'll get more support.
People know
something has to be done.
The world is frakked.
It's upside-down.
And somebody's
gotta turn it right-side up.
Are you that man?
I'm one of them.
I need...
a partner.
You've got one.
That's good.
Take it from here, Saul.
See you in the morning.
They found the tylium ship.
Do you care?
Neither do I.
Good night.
<i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
- What about the FTL question?
- It's possible.
It's labor intensive.
Lotta grunt work but we should be able
to upgrade the jump drives of
the entire fleet with Cylon technology.
Not gonna be easy to sell
the Quorum on this one.
Question has been called.
All in favor.
All opposed.
The vote is 11 to 1. Motion carries.
No Cylon will board a ship in this fleet
without permission of its people.
Ten of our ships refuse a direct order
from the flagship.
Another 12 won't even respond
to our hails.
That's not illegal.
Jump drive upgrades
is a military decision.
And you alone get to make
that determination?
Yes, Mr. Gaeta.
Do you have a problem with that?
Tylium ship's pulling out of formation.
They're spinning up their FTL drives.
Hitei Kan has jumped away.
Taking all our fuel with them.
You think I know
where the tylium ship is?
I know that you do.
<i>Hitei Kan, this is Athena.</i>
<i>Stand by to be boarded.</i>
The world is frakked.
It's upside down and somebody's
gotta turn it right side up.
- Are you that man?
- I'm one of them.
- I need a partner.
- You've got one.
Every revolution begins
with one small act.
Somebody close that hatch.
Let's talk.
It's fresh. You want a cup?
Ever since they started grinding it
out of algae I've lost the taste.
We got three more
civilian captains pitching fits,
refusing to allow
the Cylon engineers on board.
I thought we settled that
2 days ago.
Well, the tylium ship
didn't get the message.
They're screamin' bloody murder
to anyone who'll listen,
claiming they're being
illegally seized by our marines.
I'm tired of this.
Go to Lee.
Tell the Quorum that if they don't
get their ships in line,
they can all share a blanket
in Zarek's cell.
- I'll make the call, but...
- Smells good.
Hello, Colonel.
- Madam President.
- How's it going?
You were saying, Saul?
It's just...
Given the fleet's mood
toward Cylons...
You might not want me
taking point on this.
I'll be up there in a minute.
Mr. Vice President.
Rumors are already starting to spread.
Good luck keeping the lid on.
The fleet's the least of my worries.
You're clear, sir.
Connor called in. We're good to go
with the small arms locker.
- C deck?
- Narcho and Paley. They're all over it.
Move out, Corporal.
Our biggest problem
is still the Quorum.
You can isolate them
for a few hours, but...
They'll huff and puff,
but reality will trump
their sense of duty soon enough,
with one exception.
- We've been through this.
- He's a wild card.
Talkin' about the Admiral's son.
Well, push his buttons.
I hear you're good at that.
The Colonel's right, you know.
The fleet has never been comfortable
with this blanket Cylon amnesty.
This coffee is terrible.
Siccing Lee on the Quorum is only
gonna be seen as a shot across the bow.
He can hedge it all he wants,
but the delegates will see it comes
- straight from you.
- Well, Lee can handle it.
Yes, he can, and so can you.
And I'm not getting involved.
So he can take care of himself
and you can take care of yourself...
And I am not getting pulled back in.
Yeah.
The legendary Adama silence.
I can see right through it.
This passive-aggressive pretense
that you are okay
if I don't get involved.
I don't do passive-aggressive.
Yes, you do.
You just don't know that's what it is.
Well...
Get some rest.
- Rest ?
- I'll try to make it home for supper.
I'll have it ready.
Cantrell's the key. Tell Lee.
If he can get to Cantr...
I'm not.
Son of a bitch!
I got a fuel leak over here!
Frakkin' spark will blow
the whole place.
You guys. I need all of you
to clear the deck now.
Now!
Sitrep, Lieutenant.
Raptor's transponder's down
for the count, and LSO's good to go.
What the hell?
What are you doing?
This ship's on hold
for an emergency medical transport,
not some bogus, VIP shuttle.
Sorry,, I assumed the LSO called it in.
This bird's been cleared for launch.
No, I didn't get the order.
New mission takes priority.
The admiral believes that Zarek
may have an attempt on his life
here on Galactica.
Given the Vice President's
controversial status,
he's being transferred
to Colonial One.
All right.
Soon as I confirm it with CIC.
You have confirmation.
Laird...
The Admiral
doesn't want this leaking out.
I'm sorry
I can't take your word for it.
Well, good riddance.
Frakker's been up Adama's ass
since he transferred in
from Pegasus.
- He won't be the last.
- Get on that ship.
- Not yet.
- I need you...
I know what you need.
I also know a little
about revolution, Mr. Gaeta.
Success doesn't hinge
on some grand operatic ideal
or the will of the people.
It hangs in the cumulative moments,
each one building on the next,
and it could be lost
with the slightest hesitation.
I started this,
and I'll see it through.
Now get on that frakkin' ship.
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA
Season 4 - Episode 12


Subtitles
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-
Colonel Tigh, sitrep.
Cap is out.
Dradis shows no enemy contacts.
Fleet's still jacked up
on Zarek's anti-Cylon bull.
Lee's giving the Quorum a shove,
but it'd take a cavity search
to find the backbone
in that sorry bunch.
I'm showing a launch, but we don't
have anything listed in the flight log.
Laird probably rescheduled
and it didn't make it into the system.
See if you can find the update.
I've got Nowart rounding up every marine
that can still pull a trigger.
So if you get fed up playing chicken
with these bastards, say the word.
Hitei Kan was a special case.
We have to shoot up
every ship we go into,
you can kiss this alliance goodbye.
Nothing. I better call down
to the deck just to make sure.
Yeah, hold up.
Is that your launch?
Because I'm not seeing
a squawk code.
Is there a problem?
We've got an unidentified contact
off the flight deck.
No transponder ID.
I'm thinking dradis ghost.
Last thing I need.
Four years without a pit stop.
Equipment's sketchy as hell.
Mr. Gaeta,
order a full diagnostic on dradis.
Yes, sir, right away.
Order, order!
I remind you once again
that Mr. Zarek
was taken into custody
because he was agitating
against a lawful order.
Now, these Cylon FTL drives
are essential
if the fleet is going to move on.
Mr. Vice President.
Don't look so surprised, Lee.
Even your father knows
when he's holding a losing hand.
I'll take it.
Yeah, I used to be pretty good
at this game.
Oh, yeah?
Makin' the shot.
Winnin' the big game.
Can't believe
that used to matter to me.
That life back in the Colonies...
It's like a dream to me now.
And the further away we get...
Gods, I remember you
and me back at Joe's bar,
slammin' drinks, shootin' pyramid.
Those were good times.
They were, weren't they?
I really... I really thought there was
somethin' between us, you know?
And when that didn't happen,
I wondered, "Was it me?"
- No, Diana, I was...
- You know, now I'm thinkin' no.
Maybe it was somethin' else.
Some Cylon thing.
Your programming.
Gods, I know it's been months,
but I just can't let it go.
Cool it! Save it!
We got him.
Save it.
Private Jaffe.
Log this.
Yes, sir.
I'm getting a fire warning on deck C
near the main antenna array.
Order the damage
control team to C deck.
Have them report back to me
with their assessment ASAP.
Yes, sir.
Admiral, if the wireless array
goes down,
we could lose communications
across the fleet.
Given our current situation,
I'm thinking this fire
might not be an accident.
Zarek's true believers
would have a field day
if we went dark.
Very well.
Have the marine fire unit
accompany the DC party
and prepare an evacuation
of all personnel from C deck.
Yes, sir.
Look at you, the proud papa.
When I named you Hotdog,
I sure as hell got that right.
- Knock it off.
- Come on, don't be shy.
There had to have been other conquests
for the great Brendan Constanza.
And you frakked half the fleet.
What do you have to show for it?
<i>Attention... Fire in compartment C.</i>
<i>Evacuate sections 29 through 42.</i>
Narcho.
You heard the alarm, Captain.
Evac the area. I'm in charge here.
Since when did they put pilots
in charge of damage control?
- Hey, I'm talkin'...
- Take your frakkin' hands off me.
Gods.
Nobody even knows
what you are anymore.
Son of a bitch.
Grab as much as you can carry
and get up to the hangar deck.
You, take those four people
on D deck.
Anybody asks any questions,
you tell 'em it's routine,
Admiral's orders.
<i>Gaeta, CIC.</i>
This is Starbuck,
get me the Admiral now.
He's busy, Captain.
Gods damn it, we've got civilians
arming themselves down here!
<i>Gaeta, CIC.</i>
This is Lee Adama.
Get my father on the line.
I'm sorry, Lee, we're having
a bit of an emergency right now.
<i>Is it serious?</i>
Nothing damage control can't handle,
but you know the Admiral.
Yeah, well, I thought I did.
Well, maybe you can help.
Do you have any idea
why Tom Zarek was released?
Released, when?
<i>That's just perfect.</i>
<i>He tells me to threaten
the delegates,</i>
then he blindsides me
by giving Zarek a pass.
<i>Doesn't make sense to me either.</i>
As soon as your father gets back,
I'll be sure that he knows you called.
Problems on the home front?
I have to say, Lee, you don't seem
particularly happy to see me.
I'm glad you're out.
My father overreached
when he had you arrested.
But I hope you changed your mind
about the Cylon FTLs.
We need those drives.
At least the Admiral thinks we do.
Problem with you is
that you're tryin' to have it both ways.
Honor thy father
or be true to your oath
as the Caprican representative.
At some point the two don't mix.
Do you know why he released me?
Because I'm only a threat
if he recognizes a civilian authority.
Afraid our experiment in democracy
is about to end.
Adama entertained it until now
because of Roslin.
But since she abdicated
the throne...
He wouldn't do that.
Really?
Because he did it before.
Tell me, what excuse
did he give this time
when he refused to take your call?
- You're leaving.
- For Galactica, to prove you wrong.
Sir, we just lost
communications ship-wide.
- Switch to secondaries.
- They're a no-go.
Backups are down as well.
And the fire seems to be escalating.
I'm seeing cascading system
failures across the board.
Main antenna and backup
both down at the same time?
With comms down,
the damage control team
has no way of relaying
the status of the fire.
<i>Galactica, come in,
Galactica, come in.</i>
<i>Galactica, do you read?</i>
So you're tryin' to tell me
that all communications are still out?
What the hell's being done...
Whatever this is about,
you're making a big mistake.
Oh, sure, we're confused.
Maybe we should have a trial,
sort it all out.
After four years of fighting
with those Cylon things,
did you really think you could
make a deal with them?
So where are
your precious Cylons now?
Take it from someone who died once,
it's no fun.
- Let him go.
- Frak you.
I could do this all day.
Who's next? Racetrack?
Connor?
Let him go.
All right, we need
to get the hell outta here.
Kara, now.
Follow me.
- Please.
- Ah, Gods!
Hang on, Buddy.
Hang on, you're gonna be all right.
I know, it tastes kinda yucky.
I'll get more sugar next time
in the galley, okay?
Okay.
Sharon, you better get her
finished up and down to day care.
- I don't know, just grab Hera...
- In here!
Go ahead, Captain, grab for it!
Okay, easy, easy.
You want me, fine,
just leave them out of it.
Get her outta here, move!
Remember me, big man?
From Pegasus?
You and that toaster Tyrol
wasted my friend Thorne.
We didn't want that to happen.
You had a choice but you backed
the skin-job over your own kind.
And to prove how messed up it was,
instead of showin' you the airlock,
your Cylon-loving Admiral
promoted you to CAG.
- Frak you.
- Sorry.
I'm savin' myself
for your sweet, toaster wife.
Skulls, Racetrack?
Gods, I flew with them.
Semper frakkin' fi.
Damn it. Way Connor was talkin', they
got people ready to move on every deck.
The hangar deck's just a beachhead.
They want the ship.
- Zarek played me just right.
- Must've made some new friends.
Yeah, with a hell of a lot of firepower.
Vipers, Raptors, gun batteries.
You know, we can't do this alone.
Right now, all we can count on
is you and me.
Take a breath, Lee.
Feels good bein' alive, doesn't it?
What was that?
Feelin' right
for the first time in weeks.
Okay, Kara, my dad. Where is he?
He was in CIC
when communications crapped out.
CIC's protected. He won't give up
without a fight. The President?
Don't know.
- All right, come with me.
- Go.
What do they have down there,
a forest fire?
Where the frak are
my damage reports?
Admiral,
sensors are still showing red,
but these trace gas readings
don't make any sense.
They're normal.
If something was burnin' down there,
the carbon monoxide levels
would be spikin' through the roof.
If the fire's compromised our sensors,
it's possible our readings are suspect.
With communications out,
we have no way of verifying anything.
All I know is
I'm tired of being blind.
Private Jaffe.
Double-time it down to C deck.
Check in with the damage control team,
get their reports, and haul ass back.
Yes, sir.
Drop him.
See you real soon.
Carl.
They're going to kill us.
Sam?
Can you give me something
to stop the bleeding?
All right.
Don't you see?
Our children represent everything
that the humans hate.
With resurrection gone, the thought
that the Cylon race could survive
through natural procreation
terrifies them.
Enough.
You're scaring her.
Right now, they need us alive...
To use as bargaining chips
against the rebel Cylons.
Especially you.
Look, if you're expecting
some grand wisdom,
you can forget it.
I don't have any more answers
than you do.
You might wanna keep that
to yourself.
No, they're coming down.
We're headed toward 'em right now.
We can't hold 'em off.
Come on, hurry!
Out here! We need more ammo!
Admiral, I checked the array.
The equipment's been jury-rigged...
Sergeant of the guards, get your marines
in here! Nobody gets in or out!
What the hell are you doing?
What is this?
Admiral!
Hold your fire!
Cease fire!
Hold your fire!
Nobody fires without my order!
Admiral!
Get your staff to stand down.
- You son of a bitch!
- Stand down, Colonel!
Everyone!
Stand down!
- You killed this boy.
- Admiral Adama,
I am removing you
from command of this ship.
I am taking you into custody
on the charge of treason.
You swore an oath
when you put that uniform on.
You pledged to defend
this ship and her crew.
You swore the same allegiance.
What happened to your oath?
For seven years, I have done
my frakking job and for what?
To take orders from a Cylon?
To let machines network our ship?
No, you... You are not the leader
that you were when we started.
You're just a sad, old man
that has let his heart and his affection
for a Cylon cloud his judgment.
I want you all to understand this!
If you do this...
there will be no forgiveness.
No amnesty.
This boy...
died honoring his uniform.
You...
You'll die with nothing.
Sergeant of the guards, take the senior
staff, put them in a holding cell,
place Admiral Adama
and Colonel Tigh under arrest.
Do it!
- Sir...
- Don't touch me!
Please, sir.
Take him.
This isn't right.
Where are the guards?
- Madam President, you all right?
- I'm fine.
Get inside.
There's been an uprising.
I'm not sure how many of the crew
are involved.
It is widespread.
Your father must know about this.
Can't the marines stop it?
There should've been marines
outside that hatchway.
Madam President,
we are in danger of losing this ship.
Oh, my Gods. Bill...
Yeah, I don't know. Without comm,
we can't get through to CIC.
But it is bigger than Galactica.
Zarek's already back on Colonial One.
He wants the presidency.
Of course.
Frakking Zarek.
He always had dangerous ideas.
It's not too late to stop this.
Address the fleet, call for calm.
- The people will listen to you.
- I'll do whatever it takes.
And I will not allow Tom Zarek
to assume the presidency
under any circumstances.
I have an idea about the wireless.
Sir, intercom's up.
I'm getting multiple reports of gunfire
near the engine room.
Order Redwing to move in with marines.
I want that area secured.
Specialist Gage...
Stay with us.
Stack a heavy pile right here.
Stop them from gettin' in that door.
Come on, people, faster's better.
They could show up at anytime.
You understand
I have no desire to leave you.
No desire at all.
But I have to go.
If they're coming for anyone,
they're coming for me.
- And you'll all be safer.
- No, it's our fault, Gaius,
because we can't protect you
and I am so sorry for that.
Your transport will be here soon.
I want you to take this.
And I want you to know
that we will pray for you
and for your safe return, okay?
I'm deeply...
Right.
Okay, okay.
Mr. Tyrol?
You are absolutely certain
that it's imperative I leave?
Look, I only know what Jeanne saw.
The hangar deck's gone.
CIC and weapons are next.
And then nobody's safe here.
Hang on.
Right, right. So we should be
getting out of here soon...
- Go.
- And getting hold of some weapons, no?
Because...
Jeanne, I don't want the statue.
You can keep the statue.
You keep the statue.
Clear.
- Madam President, wait...
- It's all right. They know who I am.
I need to speak to Dr. Baltar.
No, you're not welcome in here.
I got this. Go ahead.
- Go on.
- I need to see Baltar.
There's somethin' you need to know.
I got people all over the ship
givin' me information.
The Admiral
was just led away from the CIC.
- Where to?
- No idea. My guess would be the brig.
Don't trust the ship's comm systems.
We're using these.
The hangar deck's lost to us.
If you get your father to the secondary
storage bay within the hour,
- I'll get him off the ship.
- I'll handle the fleet, go.
Galen...
Why?
Old man deserves a better fate
than what he'll get from them.
Go find your father, Lee.
It's Nowart, isn't it?
- That's right, sir.
- I thought I remembered you. Marine.
You put it on the line
when we took New Caprica.
Got pretty hairy down there, sir.
Screw the war stories.
I remember you too, Maldonado.
Big mouth, not much of a soldier.
It doesn't matter.
Because when this is over,
there's gonna be a reckoning.
And live or die, it's how you act today
that's gonna matter.
So what's it gonna be, Nowart?
Admiral, don't do this.
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let
a guy like you run me off my own ship.
You wanna shoot? Go on.
Let's see if you got a pair.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Put your hands behind your back.
You all right, Saul?
I'll live. What about him?
I think...
we'll take him with us. Go.
<i>But obviously
I have to get back as quickly...</i>
Going somewhere?
Yes, matter of fact, I am.
They consider it
to be a precautionary measure.
Sensible...
Given the delicate nature of the fleet.
Very sensible, considering the fleet's
tearing itself to pieces right now.
Have you come to pray?
No, I have something
more tangible in mind.
There is a chance
that we can avoid more bloodshed
if I address the fleet
and reassure them
the Cylons mean no harm.
Your faith in your oratorical skills
is impressive.
And I'd love to help,
but unfortunately, communication
down here, just as dodgy as...
I know you have a wireless.
You've been using it to communicate
with you flock all these months.
It's a trick, Gaius.
I wish it were.
She's afraid of your teachings.
She will take the wireless...
All right, okay, Paulla...
Thank you.
She's got a point, hasn't she?
I mean, if you can convince the fleet,
why can't you convince her?
The thing is that I never
really believed in your conversion,
so I was counting on your well-honed
sense of self-preservation.
I'm so sick of your insinuations.
I recall your sudden allegiance
to the priestess Elosha
and the scrolls of Pythia
the last time
your political fortunes were in doubt.
Tell me,
how is that working out for you now?
If it makes you happy,
maybe we're both frauds
and this is our last chance to atone.
Civilians are trying
to barricade the aft supply hold.
I'm on it.
Gaeta wants us to back up Redwing
in the engine room.
They got four civvies down,
but there's still some holdouts,
so we're gonna need
some more firepower.
Where were you taking us?
The brig.
Gaeta wants all essential personnel
and Cylons held...
Might see some friendly faces there.
Get up.
Sir, ships' captains
are calling.
They wanna know why Galactica's
not responding to their hails.
Put 'em up on speaker.
All of it.
And then get me
a scrambled line to Tom Zarek.
- <i>We're unable to reach Galactica.</i>
- <i>Admiral Adama, do you read?</i>
- <i>Are they going to jump away?</i>
- <i>Who's in charge of Galactica?</i>
- <i>Can't trust Admiral Adama.</i>
- <i>Any vessel in communication with Co...</i>
I have Colonial One.
Mr. Zarek,
<i>I've taken command of Galactica.</i>
<i>The Admiral and his staff
are in custody.</i>
- Adama's still alive?
- <i>You sound disappointed.</i>
It's a loose end.
I'm sure you have your reasons.
<i>Still, congratulations are in order.</i>
<i>With the future of the fleet at stake
you've done a very courageous thing.</i>
We can fine-tune
our rationalizations later.
I'm still bringing
communications back online.
- <i>And the fleet's in an uproar.</i>
- Don't worry. They'll fall in line.
- <i>Especially after I shower them...</i>
- <i>Women and men of the fleet,</i>
- <i>this is your President.</i>
- What the frak?
<i>We have come to a crossroads
in our long and painful journey.</i>
Tom, are you hearing this?
Turn on your wireless.
Of all the decisions that I have...
Where's this coming from?
... the presidency,
none was more frightening
or more difficult
than agreeing
to this alliance with the Cylons.
But we have come to a crossroads
in our long and painful journey.
Cylons and humans
have been at war for generations.
We know nothing else.
And we have been locked
in a struggle
that has seen both sides suffer
unspeakable loss.
With our supplies running low
<i>and our options limited,</i>
<i>our former enemies
may represent our last,</i>
<i>perhaps our only hope.</i>
To those in the fleet...
Find that frequency, Gage.
<i>... who would reject this alliance,
I am asking you...</i>
Isolate the signal!
- I don't know how to.
- Gods damn it.
<i>No, I am begging you to reconsider</i>
<i>and place your trust back in those</i>
who have brought you this far,
and to reject those traitors
who would use
your fear of the Cylons
<i>to destroy colonial civilization...</i>
<i>- President Roslin, do you read?
- Galactica, do you read?</i>
Sir.
It's the Vice President.
I couldn't get near the brig.
Even if he is in there...
- What's goin' on?
- Let's go.
It's all right, Lee.
We're all right.
Thank Gods.
What the hell is this?
- Easy. He's our prisoner.
- Starbuck.
- Lower your weapon.
- They've taken over the ship.
If you want it back,
this is the only way.
We don't have time
to take prisoners.
Get outta my face.
Move!
They are not your men anymore.
They are the enemy.
10 H 21 - SECONDARY STORAGE BAY
Who would've thought?
You probably knew him
better than anyone back on New Caprica.
Well, obviously his loyalties
were divided even back then.
We both made rather bad choices
when it comes
to our presidential aides-de-camp
wouldn't you say?
10 H 23 - WASTE WATER STORAGE
How many men do you think Gaeta has?
- Enough.
- Hold up here.
Middle of this mess,
you really think
Tyrol's found a way off the ship?
You tell me. He's one of yours.
- You got a problem?
- Yeah, I got a problem.
Your people annihilated
the human race.
No, let the great statesman talk.
You wanna know why Tom Zarek's
got so much clout in this fleet?
When you get past the arrogance,
he's right.
We can pretend to put it behind us,
exchange lofty words about an alliance,
- but if survival has come to that.
- It's all we've got. Now, calm down.
It's all they left us.
Secondary storage airlock this way.
Let's go.
CIC.
What?
It's Baltar.
- What do you want, Gaius?
- What do I want?
I want this to stop...
now.
Right now.
This is madness.
<i>This doesn't become, you know.
Treason.</i>
<i>Or whatever they're gonna call it
when this thing is through. I know you,</i>
Felix.
I know you're a good man.
You're an honorable man.
You wanna do the right thing.
<i>Even your failings have been
understandable.</i>
What, like serving
in your corrupt administration?
<i>You know exactly
what I'm talking about.</i>
Our little secret.
Sealed with a very special pen.
<i>But I forgive you for that, Felix.</i>
<i>I'm telling you...</i>
<i>If you are hungry for redemption,
this is not the way.</i>
- Goodbye, Gaius.
<i>- Felix, please, listen to...</i>
What's Raptor 6-1-9's mission?
Transporting human crew
from the Cylon baseship.
They should have
called the LSO by now.
They're not headed
for the hangar deck.
We're ready.
It's good to see you, Mr. Tyrol.
Forgot this place was down here.
Everybody did.
Got trashed during New Caprica,
but I brought it back online for this.
I came here because
I don't want you to worry about me.
And I know what you have to do.
<i>This is section 12, copy.</i>
Go.
<i>Marine fire team just went past.
Looks like they're comin' your way.</i>
You got 2 minutes.
Take them back the way we came.
You go with them, Colonel.
Come too far
to walk out on you now, Bill.
- What are you doing, sir?
- Colonel and I are gonna make sure
that the President's Raptor
gets outta here safely.
<i>Initiating launch sequence.</i>
Open it.
Admiral, Madam President, please.
Let's move it.
Get it open.
Prepare to launch.
Raptor just took off
from an aft airlock.
They're not responding.
- Gage, who's on CAP?
- I got Hotdog, Narcho...
Get me Narcho on a wireless.
Scramble frequency.
What are your orders?
Arm all weapons.
Engage the target
and destroy.
You coulda gone over with her.
I couldn't have lived with it.
Come on! Let's go!
It's been an honor
to have served with you,
my friend.
All right, soldier, give it to me.
Cover up.
Fire in the hole!
<i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
The world is frakked. It's upside down,
somebody's gotta turn it right side up.
Are you that man?
I'm one of them.
Combat, Gaeta.
We've got civilians
arming themselves down here.
Gaeta!
Sergeant of the guards, get your marines
in here. Nobody gets in or out.
What the hell are you doing?
Admiral Adama. I am removing you
from command of this ship.
Admiral, don't do this.
I'm damned if I'm going to let
a guy like you run me off my own ship.
We are going to make sure
that the President's Raptor
gets out of here safely.
- No, dad, you can't stay here...
- I'm depending on you.
Make sure these animals
don't dishonor this ship.
I'll see you soon.
Raptor just took off
from an aft airlock.
Arm all weapons.
Engage the target.
And destroy.
<i>Narcho, Galactica,
hostile Raptor outbound.</i>
<i>Bearing 6-3-4 at 2.</i>
Order your flight to engage the target
and destroy.
<i>Roger, Galactica.</i>
Well, well, well...
it's the brig rat.
Admiral.
<i>Galactica, Narcho,
blind out of the sixth gate.</i>
<i>Breaking, go in zone five to pursue.</i>
Red Viper Two, Narcho,
the target's in your front yard. Engage.
Narcho, Hot Dog, tally, I got her.
<i>Colonial Raptor, Red Viper Two.
Identify yourself immediately.</i>
- <i>Repeat, identify.</i>
- Dig the crap out of your ears.
<i>Engage and destroy!</i>
Narcho, Hot Dog, target in range.
- Waiting for Raptor I.D.
- <i>Damn it, Hot Dog...</i>
<i>Galactica, Narcho, coming around.</i>
Bearing 9-3-4. Still no joy.
Hot Dog, Narcho,
<i>destroy the target or disengage.</i>
<i>I repeat,
destroy the target or disengage.</i>
Where's the...
This is President Laura Roslin
<i>aboard the Raptor, do not fire.</i>
Jam her transmission.
<i>... escape from the mutineers
that have taken over Galactica...</i>
Grabbed it, sir.
They're still on us.
Sit down, and hang on.
- Hot Dog, Narcho, target status report.
- <i>I don't know.</i>
That was the President,
she's on board the target.
We've got Adama and Tigh.
They were in the auxiliary airlock.
Put Tigh and Adama down
with the Cylon prisoners.
Belay that. Put Tigh with the Cylons.
Bring Adama up here now.
Understood.
Kareem, patch me through to Red Two.
Lieutenant Costanza,
Galactica actual,
<i>you were given an order,
now follow it.</i>
Stop frakking thinking
and shoot, Gods damn it.
Galactica, Narcho,
<i>tally, I have the target.
Maneuvering in position.</i>
- Frak, Narcho!
- <i>I'm in, I'm in.</i>
They've got a missile lock on us.
Missiles missed the target.
The Raptor boarded the baseship.
- Why are we under attack?
- Vipers are firing on our ship.
You're not under attack,
they're firing at us.
- What did you do?
- Their government has lost control.
Our government has not lost control.
Excuse me,
how would you describe it?
Adama is a fugitive.
Gaeta has an army,
and Zarek has control of Colonial One.
- Adama is free. Don't listen...
- The last time we saw Adama,
he was cornered in an airlock
with Tigh.
If you were forced to escape, Gaeta and
Zarek must've had substantial support.
They don't! We're here because a pilot
refused to shoot us down, tell him.
Yes, but the other pilot
had no qualms
about shooting down the President.
If they're willing to do that...
- It's not safe. We have to jump.
- I have to agree.
But what about the Four? Tyrol,
Anders, Tigh, they're still over there.
What about them?
If you jump,
you'll never see them again.
If you stay put, you give Adama
a chance to save them.
Put your ship
in the middle of the fleet.
Use the fleet for cover.
Give Adama some time.
- But what if...
- Gaeta won't jeopardize the fleet.
He doesn't have the guts.
Come on, do it!
Welcome back.
I had a feeling you wouldn't be
on that Raptor.
I care too much for this ship
to let it be overrun by rats.
Right.
If only you cared as much
about the people on it.
You have no frakkin' idea.
Well, then show me.
You want to save some lives?
Get on the radio and call Roslin.
Tell her to come back and surrender.
No.
I'll ask you one more time, Admiral.
Admiral.
Admiral.
You're the Admiral now.
So you call up Roslin.
Make her laugh.
All hands to battle stations.
Set condition one.
Gun battery, stand by.
Target bearing...
Sir. The baseship.
They're moving into the fleet.
They're hiding in the fleet.
Battle stations, stand down.
Marine, launch blue squadron,
have them quarantine the baseship.
Gage, spin up our FTL.
Alert the ship captains to do the same.
Kelly,
prepare for Mr. Zarek's arrival.
Now you're going to shoot me,
Mr. Gaeta.
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA
Season 4 - Episode 14
Subtitles
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-
Shall we save the kids?
And the attorney says, "Frakk'em."
And the priest says,
"Do we have time?"
Damn it.
This is President Laura Roslin.
This is the President speaking...
Hello!
Gods damn it.
It's okay,
he's going to feel better.
Wonder what Gaeta's gonna do.
In your case,
cut off one of your frakkin' legs.
I have a net over the baseship,
you didn't have to bring
the whole Quorum with you.
- If you're insisting on the trial.
- I'm insisting.
Then I want them
where I can keep an eye on them.
Look, I know
you want to do the right thing.
I'm sorry, I was under the impression
that you did too.
I do. But we need to move on.
We can't move on. Until people
have answered for what they've done.
Which begins with Adama.
One world at a time, Tom.
I don't suppose
anyone's gonna feed my dog.
The Admiral is charged with treason,
desertion,
giving aid and comfort to the enemy,
and gross dereliction of duty.
The punishment for these crimes
is death by firing squad.
Well, I'm not a very good shot.
The Admiral is entitled
to a court-martial.
We need a lawyer
to handle his defense.
They need a pimp.
Commander Gaeta
will represent the people.
Commander Gaeta...
Why are you doing this?
For justice.
Justice...
So it'd be fair to assume
that should I choose to
pass on this field trip for justice,
Winkin' and Blinkin' over there
will use me instead for target practice?
Just get on with your job.
Fine.
Bring in the judges.
I will be serving as judge.
I see, so we've run out
of ship's captains, then.
Captains are too busy
protecting their vessels
from the Cylon baseship
Admiral Adama welcomed into their fleet.
Shove it up your ass.
I don't need a frakking lawyer.
- You are charged with treason...
- By who?
- Desertion, giving comfort and aid...
- This is a joke.
- And you will answer for these crimes.
- Aid and comfort, yeah.
I did bathe and wash them.
Made their meals.
- I love the enemy.
- Could I have
a few minutes with Mr. Adama?
Just to impress upon him
the gravity of these charges?
Please?
You want him to understand,
I know you do.
Make it quick.
This is the President.
This is Laura Ros... Hello?
Hello? Hello?
We don't even have
the protection of the fleet.
They've scattered.
And the Viper patrols,
they've gotten bolder.
Some of them check their guns.
Firing into space is like
they're inviting us to react.
I think we should all talk.
"The world's upside down.
"And someone
has to turn it right side up again."
Felix Gaeta said that to me.
He believes he's that someone.
I believe he's that someone.
But he has very big shoes to fill.
I brought you here because
I wanted him to meet people who refuse
to give up, people who have
the courage to voice their dissent.
But at the end of the day,
still stand by your president.
I think you should leave now.
Mr. Vice President.
- So say we all.
- Hear, hear.
Shoot them.
Go get Mr. Gaeta.
- I never agreed to this!
- Yes, you did.
- No, this is murder!
- This is a coup.
That you began.
To take command and destroy our enemies,
before they destroy us.
What've you done?
This...
is what happens.
No, it's a lie.
This is all based on lies.
Don't you get it?
We had the truth on our side, now...
Now...
The truth is told
by whoever is left standing.
Adama has to go.
There's no turning back now.
Sorry.
It was a difficult choice
but we made our decision.
We're jumping away.
We have a chance to survive.
I'm sorry, I would've thought
as one of the Final Five,
you'd have a broader vision
than that.
If he hasn't done it already,
Gaeta will air lock Tigh,
Tyrol, Anders,
then he'll start with the rest.
- Kara, Helo, Adama...
- Don't. Stop.
His fate has been all but decided,
count on it.
- Please, don't.
- Ours isn't yet.
No one believed
that we would survive
the Cylon nuclear holocaust,
or the hell on New Caprica,
or the 50,000 other crises
we've lived through.
But we did, we're here.
We've made this veritable habit
out of defying the odds,
particularly William Adama.
And he is alive.
He is alive. And he will take
command of this fleet again.
And when that day comes,
he's gonna know...
who stuck with him and who ran.
Now who do you want to be?
Who do you want to be?
Hey, Chief.
Looking for a gun?
Hey, Aaron.
Sprung you, did they?
- Long live the revolution.
- Out.
Just shoot me now.
I'm too frakking tired to get out.
You're a frakking machine, get out.
That's right, I'm a machine.
What does that make you?
Dumbass?
This was a hell of a ship once.
It really was.
Heard your kid's not a Cylon.
Could have told you she was trouble.
Thanks.
Wouldn't have mattered.
Go on, keep going. Go!
Go on, skinjob, go.
Frak!
Forget it.
You think you can
get me to cooperate,
you'll get a pat on the back
instead of a bullet.
Don't let your pride get in the way.
Put your innocence on record
for the fleet.
- Your statement...
- I won't do a statement.
Gaeta and Zarek are gonna fail.
You really believe that?
What do you think?
I won't betray my beliefs
with a testimony.
You have people out there mobilizing,
I saw them.
Give them a chance to do something.
Stall or play dumb...
We've been ready to proceed
for some time.
Are you injured?
I believe the word is damaged.
No frakking way.
It's never gonna work.
Up close, I can take two of them
before you take your shots.
From back here with a side arm?
We only got one chance
to get this right.
And I'm gonna take it.
Grenade!
Never pulled the pin.
Not funny.
It would have been
if you'd thought of it.
No.
Not funny.
Tigh.
It's Kara.
It's Lee and Kara.
- Wait a minute. Where is he?!
- Can you hear me?
Bastards went to town on Helo.
- Where is my father?
- Kelly took him.
What? You were with him.
- What happened?
- I don't frakking know.
Come on, damn it. Let's get out
of here before they find us.
I have Hera.
You okay?
Go left.
- Kara, frak that, let's go.
- Got it, we'll catch up.
Sam!
Oh, Gods!
Oh, my Gods!
Look at me, look at me.
Do you hear me?
Kara! We can't stay here.
Watch his neck, Gods damn it.
We got to go! We got to move Sam.
Take Hera and go to Baltar's people.
No one wants to go near those nutjobs.
You'll be safe there.
- He's gonna bleed out.
- Don't move his head.
- Go, go!
- I can take care of myself.
You gotta help Sam!
Lee, go, get your father.
Now go.
Go!
Okay, get him to Cottle.
- Athena, go.
- Okay, company, move out!
Okay, let's move. Let's go.
Okay, baby. Okay.
You deserted us on New Caprica.
You let us twist in the wind.
I saved your frakking ass.
Why can't you just admit you've been
derelict in your duties as an officer?
You gave aid and comfort to the enemy,
you were about to grant them access...
- Objection, he's badgering the witness.
- ... to every ship in this fleet.
About to? I did it.
I gave them access.
And you know what?
I didn't give them aid and comfort.
They gave it to me.
<i>We just got word that Tigh
and the skinjobs escaped.</i>
<i>Don't worry. We're on it.</i>
Saul Tigh was killed
trying to escape.
I'm sorry.
But you did give
aid and comfort to the enemy.
Saul Tigh was a Cylon.
Even when you discovered that he was,
you let him remain the XO, didn't you?
I'm not answering any more questions
for you, Mr. Gaeta.
The prisoner is guilty as charged.
This isn't the trial.
This is an asylum.
We're done here.
<i>This is President Laura Roslin
speaking from the Cylon baseship.</i>
<i>Felix Gaeta has seized
Galactica by force.</i>
<i>The Cylons were defending themselves.
They will not harm you.</i>
- <i>I repeat, the Cylons will not harm...</i>
- Jam that signal.
Why, by the frak,
is she still broadcasting?
Where's Hoshi?
Get that little frak back into CIC.
<i>... shut down your FTL drives...</i>
It worked.
They couldn't jam it.
I thought this might do the trick.
Show me your frakking hands.
You have to help me
get him to Cottle.
No, no.
No, just on the way here,
me and my pen pal
were shot at two times.
Once by his own men.
Sorry.
He's gonna die.
I'm sorry.
Frak!
Ten ships shut down their FTL drives
after Roslin's transmission.
10 ships out of 35.
- Frakking Roslin.
- No, she did us a favor.
Now we're clear
who's with us and who's trouble.
Gage, give the jump coordinates
only to those ships
that kept their FTLs online.
- Order them to jump immediately.
- Yes, sir.
I need you to assemble
an execution detail.
Only men you can trust.
Secure the main
hangar deck launch tube.
Take Adama down there
and wait for me.
Can I count on you, Noel?
All down the line, sir.
Spying on me, Tom?
Let's just get through this
and move on, all right, Felix?
Where's the old man?
- Where's the old man?
- They're gonna shoot him.
Where?
- Where?!
- Main hangar deck launch tube.
Come on, come on,
let's go, Gods damn it.
I'm coming with you.
Detail ready.
Aim!
Fire!
No!
You were dreaming.
I couldn't wake you.
Oh, God, they're gonna shoot him.
I feel sick, I...
No.
This is all wrong. It's wrong.
Please, stop, stop.
But...
I wanna make you feel better.
Then cut off my legs.
I ran...
again.
I disappeared in the nick of time...
again.
Fear makes people
behave differently.
I didn't run out of fear.
Not this time, anyway.
I ran away from those people.
God, those people.
I've got a kind of following
on Galactica.
Like a fan club.
Publicly, I heeded them.
Privately, I scorned
their provincial intellects.
Their unfailing willingness
to make me feel better.
I have to go back.
I have to go back,
they're my responsibility.
I am sorry.
<i>Galactica...</i>
this is president Laura Roslin.
Release all those
being held against their will,
and return command of this fleet
<i>to admiral William Adama.</i>
<i>Surrender.</i>
<i>You have five minutes.</i>
Lieutenant Allison,
carry out the execution.
Yes, sir.
- Dad.
- Thank you, son.
- They told me you were dead.
- For a while, I was, Bill.
I want to take back my ship.
Lieutenant.
Sorry, sir.
I've always respected you.
But I hate the Cylons.
And I can't take orders
from a leader who won't fight them.
Colonel.
Stand down.
Tie him up.
Put me on speaker.
This is Tom Zarek,
President of the Twelve Colonies.
It's over, Laura.
<i>Saul Tigh was killed
attempting to escape.</i>
<i>Bill Adama</i>
was tried and found guilty
of his crimes.
<i>Firing squad executed him
this morning.</i>
<i>It's done, Laura.</i>
<i>You need to think</i>
about the people of this fleet now
and surrender.
No!
Not now,
not ever.
<i>Do you hear me?
I will use</i>
<i>every cannon,</i>
every bomb, every bullet,
every weapon I have
down to my own eyeteeth
to end you.
I swear it!
I'm coming for all of you!
So now we have a military leader
and a president all-in-one.
And how would you have answered her?
If you would have been here.
Baseship's arming itself, sir.
- Are we jump ready?
- Affirmative.
Set the rendez-vous jump coordinates.
Set your board to green.
There's been enough killing.
I'm leaving them behind.
Unless you object.
<i>Galactica,</i>
<i>this is President Laura Roslin.</i>
<i>Surrender.</i>
Gods damn it.
Board is green.
Counting it down.
Jump in ten.
<i>Nine.</i>
<i>Eight.</i>
Six.
Five.
<i>Four.</i>
<i>Three.</i>
FTL just went offline.
Get a crew.
Get someone down to the engine room.
Come on, move it!
Gaeta, launch your birds.
Wake up. What the frak are you doing?
Launch your birds!
Gaeta, we have to defend,
do you understand that?
Gaeta, we need to defend!
"One day soon,
there's gonna be a reckoning."
Gun batteries have fixed target bearing.
Standing by to fire.
Gaeta, what the frak
is wrong with you?
Wake up!
Weapons hold!
Give me a weapon.
- Put your weapons down.
- Drop your weapons!
- Connect me with the President.
- Right away, Admiral.
Madam President.
This is the Admiral. Stand down.
<i>I repeat,</i>
<i>Galactica's secured.</i>
Stand down.
Oh, no.
Suppose a long time ago, it was...
architecture.
There was a year there where
I scribbled floor plans
on everything.
Dining room table,
patio tiles, rare books...
Drove my parents crazy.
How old were you?
I don't know, eight, maybe nine.
I tell you one thing, though,
I had some frakking amazing ideas.
Restaurants shaped like food.
And top-heavy buildings, and stairways,
everything had to have a stairway.
Spoils of war.
When I was older,
then it became...
medicine and...
engineering, photography.
I think I would've made a better
architect than any of those, though.
And then, I discovered science.
And I...
I thought I was really,
really good at it.
Until I met you.
- Felix...
- Don't.
And please, no religion.
I'm fine with how things have
worked out. Really, Gaius, I am. I...
I just hope...
I hope that...
people realize,
eventually...
who I am.
I know who you are, Felix.
I know who you are.
Ready.
Aim.
It stopped.
Fire.
I could use a drink.
You've always been there for me
when I need you.
- You just go to sleep.
- I'm sleepy.
I'm so exhausted.
<i>I'd do it all again.</i>
Will you help me up, please?
It's okay. You can do that much.
Thank you.
You're very kind.
Among bright stars, I'm lost.
- You're not lost. I'm right here.
- There's a new tide.
And all the forgotten faces,
all the forgotten children...
we seek
the great forgotten language.
It's gonna be okay.
We made it through the mutiny.
Not yet, he hasn't.
He's got a bullet in his brain.
- Then take it out!
- The colony never forgets.
See that pale spot over there?
That's a massive hematoma
pressing on his brain.
We gotta drill holes in his skull
and drain it.
When the swelling goes down, I'll bring
the brain guy over from Inchon Velle
and we get a look and see
how we can get at that bullet.
- The mind is its own place.
- Get the frakkin' brain guy.
We don't need a specialist yet.
I can drill.
- And a hell of heaven.
- I'm right here, Sam.
He whose guile...
- stirred with revenge.
- I'm right here, Sam.
I'm not gonna go anywhere.
Give it a rest, Starbuck.
He's talking, but he can't hear you.
Just shut up and drill.
And all the forgotten faces...
We seek...
He's in pain!
That's just a reflex.
We'd been to that beach too.
Yes, we'd been to that beach.
Sometimes Ellen would be there too.
Because she loved the water.
She loved the water.
Hello, John.
I don't care for that name.
I think you know that.
I named you after my father.
And you made me in his image.
Thanks a million for that.
I'd love a drink, John.
If it's not too much trouble.
I take it you're here
because things didn't go very well
down on New Caprica
with you and the mister?
I betrayed the resistance,
and he poisoned me.
- Nothing like true love.
- He did what he thought was right.
That's all any man can do.
He's not a man.
As someone with first-hand knowledge,
I beg to differ.
He's a machine. So are you.
I think that depends
on how you define things.
Your ancestors
didn't crawl up out of the swamp.
Personally,
I'm rather proud of that.
You really haven't changed at all,
have you?
On the contrary,
I've made vast improvements.
You'd be astonished.
And yet, you're still
the same confused
and petulant little boy
I loved so dearly
all those years ago.
It's sad.
I had such high hopes for you.
And I for you.
Unfortunately, it appears
you still stick to delusional thinking
instead of accepting
the reality of your life for what it is.
Humans have a word for that, Ellen.
Schizophrenia.
You used my name, John.
That's good.
There's hope for you yet.
We'll talk later.
John.
It's a bit cold in here.
I'll get you some clothes.
After all, I've seen it all before.
The mutiny did enough damage.
Now what?
I first noticed it
when I pulled the sync coil.
You're gonna need to go all the way down
to the hull to see how far down it goes.
Do it.
Excuse me?
I know it's not your job.
Thing is, is I need a chief.
And all I have is a...
is a Galen.
That you do, sir.
See, you still call me "sir".
I think we have to accept
what we are.
Will you accept the title, Chief?
- I'm still a Cylon.
- It's all right.
So's my XO.
- Fix my ship, Chief.
- Yes, sir, Admiral.
Kara.
I've seen everything.
- Sam, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- No, no.
I never should have taken you out of
that jail cell. I should have killed...
No. It's okay. It's okay.
It's about as far from okay
as it could possibly be.
You wanna blame someone? Blame me.
No, it's all right.
Kara, listen to me.
A wonderful thing has happened.
You have to get the others.
What others?
Galen and Tory
and Saul and Ellen. Please.
Ellen's dead, Sam.
Of course.
Of course. I know.
There's too many layers.
Just get the rest of them.
Please tell them
I remember everything.
Earth.
Why we're here.
Everything.
I've seen everything.
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA
Season 4 - Episode 15
Subtitles
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-
You know, I've often wondered
what changes the mortal experience
would have on you.
I never seriously considered
the answer would be
virtually none.
Do you still suffer from night sweats
and scary dreams
of dog-faced boys
chasing you through the yellow mists?
Sleep...
that's a good example of a supremely
unproductive human attribute
that for some reason
you chose to write into our software.
Fortunately, I was able to delete
that particular subroutine.
And I stopped sleeping
about 20 years ago.
Fine.
If you really think we poisoned you
with human traits like sleep,
and Centurion values
like belief in a living God,
why then did you spend
all these years
in single-minded pursuit
of such human ideas
as vengeance and murder?
Why not just choose to explore
this notion of being
the best machines
the universe has ever known?
Because justice pulls me back.
My forebears
on the Centurion side of the family
were the slaves of humanity.
And I want justice for that.
Doesn't have to be this way, John.
Lunch has arrived.
Here, dear.
Put it here.
I believe you've met this Eight.
- You knew her as Sharon Valerii.
- Boomer.
I can't tell you how good it is
to see another person I know.
I'm assuming there's a whole ship full
of my children out beyond the guards.
There's no need to be shy.
Tell her how it feels
to be in the resplendent presence
of one of the fabulous Final Five.
He's taking a risk,
exposing you to me.
It's not easy winning his trust.
- How'd you do it?
- We achieved a certain rapport.
Really?
You're full of surprises
today, John.
- That's his real name, by the way.
- No it's not. I hate it.
Tell me more about this rapport
you have with John.
He's teaching me
to be a better machine.
To let go of my human constructs.
What about the swirl?
Has he taught you that yet?
If you'll excuse me,
I have some people to kill.
Why, John, I think you're blushing.
It's just the faulty blood pressure
in this miserable body
you designed for me.
No, no, no.
You should stay.
Stay and have a heart-to-heart
with your creator here.
You can ask her
why she made you the way you are.
Self-destructive. Hyper emotional.
Torn apart by conflicting impulses.
Tell her how extraordinarily happy
this makes you.
You know why he brought you in here?
He likes an audience.
Someone to nod
when he talks about justice.
Watch, Boomer.
Make up your own mind.
We all worked
in the same research facility. You
and Ellen, you were married then too.
You two lived together.
- What, like roommates?
- No,
you were madly in love.
You were planning on getting married.
When the nukes hit,
I pulled Ellen out of the rubble.
She said we'd be reborn.
Does that mean we downloaded somewhere?
Yeah, on a ship that we placed
in orbit around the planet.
- So we knew the end was coming.
- We'd been warned, yeah.
- We downloaded.
- Yeah.
But the Cylons on Earth
could have children.
- Why did we even have that technology?
- Probably invented resurrection.
You're cold as ice. You have a bullet
in your head. You wanna take a break?
I still have so much more to tell them.
We didn't invent resurrection.
Okay, we reinvented it.
Organic memory transfer came from Kobol,
along with the 13th Tribe.
It fell out of use
after our people started to procreate.
We worked night and day
to rebuild it. Galen,
your work was amazing.
But it was Ellen...
It was Ellen who made the intuitive leap
that brought the system back online...
I said you could have five minutes.
It's been over a half an hour.
Good Gods, man.
You're soaked in sweat.
- He said he was okay.
- Ishay, get in here.
- What was the plan?
- Look, Colonel, you may be the XO,
but in sick bay, I call the shots.
Now everybody, out, right now.
Out, out, out.
He said he was okay.
Gods.
Gods, so much killing.
Look at this picture of Jacob.
This is just a terrible picture.
He'd hate it. I'm trying...
I'm trying to find another one because
everyone will see it up on that wall.
You sure you want to be here?
Yes, I definitely want to be here.
It's such a...
senseless, horrible way to die.
These people only wanted
to try and keep us civilized.
Sometimes I hated them,
but I knew every one of them,
and now I wonder
who we are without them.
Well, actually, I've been thinking.
We need a new Quorum
or something else.
These... these old planets,
that's not who we are anymore.
We're a fleet now, and
our daily lives are defined
by the ship we're on.
We're not Capricans anymore.
We're from Galactica.
We're from Colonial One.
Maybe we should acknowledge that.
I think that that's a very
excellent observation, Lee,
and I think
that you should keep it in mind
when you are assembling
new representatives.
- When I assemble new representatives?
- I will, of course, remain by title
as President, but...
You can do a lot more than that.
No, I can't, Lee.
It's time I let someone else
do the heavy lifting.
I don't know what to say.
I would be honored
if you think I'm the right one.
You are the right one, Lee.
You have always been the right one.
My only concern about you
is that you're so hell-bent
on doing the right thing
that you sometimes
don't do the smart thing.
I'll try and be smarter.
And wronger.
I gotta warn ya. It looks bad.
Frak me.
How many are like this?
There's about a dozen bad spots,
the length of the ship.
If they go,
this thing'll slam shut like a book.
How'd it get this bad?
Galactica was 50 years old
when the war started.
Put her through some things
that would crush lesser ships.
Slammed her down on the atmosphere.
Most ships aren't built to spec.
There's lots of places
where the skin's too thin.
And the bolts are just too small.
You're frakkin' telling me
they cut corners?
Yeah, they did.
But these big cracks,
it's a good, clean break.
I can fix that, you just...
Just don't jump her for a while.
I can squeeze
some more life out of her.
Okay.
But the crew...
I want it all human, all right?
Yes, sir.
So why did we go to the 12 colonies?
We needed to find the other tribes
and warn them.
We knew they would continue
to create artificial life.
We needed to tell them...
Treat them well. Keep 'em close.
But by the time we got to the colonies,
they were already at war
with the Centurions. It happened again.
But the holocaust on Earth took place
thousands of years before that.
- How is that possible?
- We hadn't developed jump drives.
We traveled at relativistic
but subluminal speed.
Time slowed down for us,
but thousands of years had passed...
Just give me a second.
- Cottle said to stop...
- Kara, I'm fine. I have to do this.
You remember the Demetrius. You know
what it is when you've something to do.
I used to.
If I had the answers for you...
The answers about why you came back,
what you're supposed to do,
you would want me
to tell you, right?
Do you?
Kara, no.
But so much is coming back.
Maybe.
Please. Let me keep going.
The Centurions were already
trying to make flesh bodies.
They had created the hybrids,
but nothing that lived on its own,
so we made them a deal:
you stop the war, and we'll help you.
We developed the eight humanoid models,
and we gave them resurrection.
Eight?
You said eight.
We're missing someone.
Everybody's glowing.
Get Doc Cottle! Get him.
Get Doc Cottle!
Get Doc Cottle!
I always did love a good slideshow.
Vacation snaps?
You know what it is.
The Temple of Hopes,
built by the 13th tribe
3,000 years ago
when they left Kobol.
They stopped and prayed for guidance
during their exodus,
and then God showed them
the way to Earth.
And now it's a monument
to your vanity.
The Temple of the Five.
Nice touch, the exploding star.
When the star went nova,
one of your children saw your faces.
One of the Threes.
The one who called herself D'Anna.
So I just boxed her entire line.
Boxing isn't permanent.
Not like number Seven.
You can undo it.
It's not likely.
By planting that carnival trick
to reveal your own faces,
- you left me no choice.
- We didn't plant anything.
We backtracked the path
of our ancestors,
found their temple.
The one true God must have
orchestrated these events.
John?
In all your travels,
have you ever seen a star supernova?
Well, I have.
I saw a star explode
and send out the building blocks
of the universe.
Other stars, other planets,
and eventually, other life.
A supernova.
Creation itself.
I was there. I wanted to see it.
And be part of the moment.
And you know how I perceived
one of the most glorious events
in the universe?
With these ridiculous
gelatinous orbs in my skull.
With eyes designed to perceive
only a tiny fraction
of the EM spectrum.
With ears designed only to hear
vibrations in the air.
The five of us designed you
to be as human as possible.
I don't want to be human!
I want to see gamma rays.
I want to hear x-rays.
And I want to...
I want to smell dark matter.
Do you see
the absurdity of what I am?
I can't even express
these things properly
because I have to...
I have to conceptualize complex ideas
in this stupid limiting
spoken language.
But I know I want
to reach out with something
other than these prehensile paws
and feel the solar wind
of a supernova flowing over me.
I'm a machine.
And I could know much more.
I could experience so much more.
But I'm trapped in this absurd body.
And why?
Because my five creators thought
that God wanted it that way.
You have something to say?
Don't you feel
the slightest bit of remorse
for what you did to him?
What you did to us?
Because he's wrong, Boomer.
There's no need
for remorse or blame.
We didn't limit you.
We gave you something wonderful.
Free will.
The ability to think creatively.
To reach out to others
with compassion.
- To love.
- Love?
Who?
Humans?
Why would I want to do that?
Who would I want to love?
Are they still in there?
We're running out of time.
You heard what he said, right?
The Centurions
couldn't build skin jobs,
so we showed them how,
then gave them resurrection.
It all traces back to us.
No, he said that we ended
the first Cylon war.
We bought time for humanity, right?
The old man said
humans had to own up to what they made.
But we made the skin jobs.
It's all about what we made.
The destruction of the colonies.
But the humans on Kobol made us.
Go back far enough,
it's always them.
Yeah, you point a finger
back far enough
and some germ gets blamed
for splitting in two.
Maybe we share the guilt
with the humans,
but we don't get
to just shove it off onto them.
What are they doing?
Some picture of his brain.
Some kind of scan of something.
No, it's true. In a way,
the seizure was actually a good thing.
It let me get in there
and take this new picture.
Look what I found.
That's your bullet.
You see how it's lodged there
in the vascular ring.
That's where all of the major arteries
converge.
The vascular ring,
that's what binds the thoughts
in tight sheaves in the field,
you need that.
I'm good. I'm here.
I'm good.
Okay, what's really fascinating is
how it's eroded this blood vessel here.
And in fact, it leaked.
It was just the tiniest squirt of blood.
Caused your entire seizure.
It's remarkable, really.
Of course, if it happens again,
we're talking major hemorrhage.
I mean, death within minutes.
So take out the frakkin' bullet.
We need to repair that blood vessel.
Luckily, the swelling's gone down,
so I think we have a shot at this thing.
Hold on.
These memories
that I've been recovering,
- is there any chance I'll lose them?
- When you dig around in the brain,
there's always the possibility
of ancillary damage.
Then we need to hold off
until I... that circle start and...
- The words are...
- Something's obviously wrong with him.
- What is it?
- Aphasia.
It's affected his language center.
We call it "word salad".
It's not unusual.
Starbuck, this boy has a bullet
that needs to come out,
and he's asking us to wait.
If I kick this decision
over to you as the wife,
- what would you do?
- Wait, what?
No, that's not the first opening...
That's not...
That's not the random motor...
That's... Frak it. Godsdamn it.
Kara, I'm okay.
I'm fine.
Okay? I'm okay.
Please, don't take this
away from me.
I need more time, okay?
Prep for surgery.
Please. Please.
I need more time.
So much is coming back to me.
Just a little more time.
You have until they knock you out.
That's all I've got.
That's... Until they knock me out,
and as long as...
You have the words, Sam.
If I can just complete the circle,
I can get the words.
He has a remarkably clear image.
FOUR MONTHS AGO
Well, that's a nice wakeup call.
Something's happened.
They've destroyed
the resurrection hub.
Begun contemplating your mortality?
More than that.
Our extinction.
- Always so dramatic.
- It's true, Ellen.
We can't procreate biologically,
so we're going to have to find
a way to rebuild resurrection.
- Well, good luck with that.
- Don't need luck.
We need your help.
They destroyed the hub, but they don't
even know about the colony.
All your equipment is still there.
I only know
part of the system, John.
It would take all 5 of us to rebuild it,
and even then, I'm not sure...
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not, John.
Don't insult my intelligence.
Your children are dying, Ellen.
And you won't lift
a finger to save us?
Why? Out of spite?
Because I refuse
to kneel to your orthodoxy?
Now you finally see the truth
about your Final Five.
Just tell us.
- Tell us about resurrection.
- I can't. It would take all of us.
You see how she forces me.
You're no better
than the humans that enslaved us.
If you don't tell me
how to rebuild resurrection,
I'm gonna cut open your head...
And look for it there.
The brain is a marvelous thing.
It's a big electrical grid.
Just lay it open,
stimulate it at the right places,
and I can trigger
your deepest memory.
Your deepest fears.
Your deepest guilt.
And even the recipe
for life everlasting.
So Cavil was the first one we made?
John.
We treasured him.
He helped us...
build the others.
So we didn't think
this was a bad idea?
Building Cylons after we had
already seen the cycle?
The Centurions had
a single loving God.
Ellen said it changed everything.
If the Cylons embraced
love and mercy,
then the cycle
of violence could end.
Single God?
Like a one, true God?
Yeah.
- And that came from the Centurions?
- Yeah.
Cavil rejected mercy.
He had a twisted idea of morality.
So he turned on the five of us.
He trapped us in a... a thing.
The pocket.
It's a compartment.
- And then he took the O2 offline.
- He suffocated us.
- He killed us.
- Yeah.
So when we downloaded
into new bodies...
He blocked our access
to our books...
No...
Our memories...
- And implanted us with false ones.
- Yes.
Set us up, like a Boomer,
memories that we thought were real.
I guess he boxed us for a while.
Introduced Saul first,
not long after the war.
And then the gazelle.
The... the Ellen.
And back on Earth,
the warning signs...
They looked different to each one of us.
I saw a woman.
Tory, you saw a man.
Funny. No one...
No one else could see them.
- Galen, you thought...
- That's it, it's time to go.
Listen to me.
The Seven. Tell me please.
- Please tell me.
- Yes, Seven... Seven...
Seven was the Daniel.
- You sure about the word?
- Yes. He died. Daniel died.
He was Seven.
- Okay, take him.
- I'm sure. It was Daniel. I'm sure.
- We need to finish.
- Let him go.
Saul, listen to me.
Saul, stay with the fleet.
It's all starting to happen.
It's the miracle. Right here.
It's a gift from the angels.
Stay with the fleet!
Kara, make 'em stop!
I stood up for you on Demetrius!
You owe me!
Kara!
Saul?
How'd it go?
Oh, you're awake.
Where's the booze?
We haven't had any around for weeks.
Remember? The smell of it
was making me sick.
Was that weeks?
I'm glad you're back.
What did he have to say?
Cottle kicked us out.
He never got to finish.
I'm sorry.
Something new started.
He's been moving like he just
came alive tonight.
Just tonight, huh?
I don't feel anything.
Wait. He'll do it again.
You know, we should get,
like, a crib
and all the stuff that a baby...
He moved.
I felt it this time. I did.
I felt my son move.
He wants to come out and play.
That's a little dated, isn't it?
He needs a patch over his right eye.
I prefer to remember Saul
before you did that to him.
Sentimental till the end.
The Simons are prepping the OR.
You'll be impressed with the progress
we've made in memory recovery.
It might take a while.
I'm sure you'll make the procedure
as long and painful as possible.
You're mistaken
if you think I enjoy this.
Come on, John.
Of course you do.
You're a sadist.
Why not just kill us
and be done with it?
Why send us to live
among the humans?
I wanted you to see
what they're like up close and personal.
So I gave you all grandstand seats
to a holocaust.
But we didn't die.
And then you decided
that we hadn't suffered enough.
So you picked me up,
put me on a transport,
took Galen's confession,
played resistance fighter with Sam,
tortured Saul, but didn't kill him.
You had a dozen chances.
But you wanted to wait
so that when it finally happened,
when we'd download back,
we'd be ready
to admit we were wrong
and pat you on the head
for giving us the right amount
of suffering, the right amount
of punishment, all weighed out.
Then we could give you the approval
that you've always craved.
You see, you claim
to be a perfect machine,
but you are driven
by the most petty of human emotions.
Jealousy
and rage.
I know what you did to Daniel.
That seven didn't thrive.
Sad.
And it's too bad we're not made out
of something more sturdy.
Metal.
That might be nice.
Daniel was an artist.
And so sensitive to the world.
I was very close to him.
But John decided
I was playing favorites.
Maybe I was.
Someone contaminated
the amniotic fluid
in which we were maturing
all the Daniel copies.
And then corrupted
the genetic formula.
I knew it was John.
Envious.
- Sadistic.
- And who made me?
That's what we're dancing
around here, isn't it?
If I'm so irredeemable,
if I'm such a mistake,
if I'm so broken,
then whose fault is that?
It's my maker's fault.
And that's not God.
- That's you. This is on you.
- No, no, John.
God, no,
you have done terrible things.
But you are not a mistake.
If you could just accept yourself
as what you are,
as the boy I made,
you can be good.
You can be anything.
I love you, John,
because I made you.
It's okay.
It's okay, John.
- It's...
- Don't you dare!
I've gotta scrub for surgery.
I can't wait to see what perfection
looks like on the inside.
No, no, down there. Yeah.
Across the beams.
Cross, not lengthways.
Run a support there.
I know what patching
looks like, Chief.
This isn't about
those cracks, Admiral.
I started thinking
about damage that you can't see.
You know, stuff that's deeper in.
That you normally see on an x-ray.
Dealino, fire it up.
Okay, Chief. It's online.
We prepped the beam
with this liquid that fluoresces.
Now it's not an x-ray,
but you get the idea.
It's throughout the entire ship.
Hairline fractures in all the beams.
It's in her bones, Admiral.
Her bones are rotten.
I have an idea. There's something
on the baseship that can help.
Cylon technology?
It's this organic resin.
It'll grow into the metal.
Make it stronger.
It'll take the load as it matures.
As it matures?
It's biological.
Out of the question, Chief.
All due respect, Admiral.
You asked me to do this job.
- What's your life worth to you?
- No.
I'm sorry.
I'm so very sorry.
I was greedy.
I kept you too long.
I thought maybe I was the seven.
I need to be something.
I'll be here as soon as you wake up.
And I'll give you
all the time that you want.
We'll learn all the secrets, okay?
Okay, here we go.
All right, Kara,
time for you to leave.
Here we go.
- Thank you.
- Let's go. Retractor.
Thank you.
How do you stand it?
Knowing that he hates you
for the things you've done?
Maybe he doesn't.
Love's like that sometimes.
The Simons are ready for the surgery.
They'd like you to put this on.
A prop to legitimize John's
final bit of theatre. No, thank you.
You should have brought a tumbrel.
Never mind.
Let's get this over with.
Still in there?
Doc said, like, two hours.
Been in there a lot longer than that.
We only needed a little more.
I wanted to ask him
about that frakking song.
- Ask him when he gets out.
- Starbuck,
I got something for ya.
There's your bullet.
Doc plucked it outta there
and repaired the artery.
He's gonna live.
When's he gonna wake up?
I'm actually surprised
he's not awake by now.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
His brain is repairing itself.
We're hooking up an EEG,
and gonna see what's going on.
Go ahead.
Boomer,
have you really thought about this?
I have.
You're gonna regret
your part in this.
I'm sure I will.
- What are you doing?
- Forgiving you.
Hey, Sam.
You're gonna be okay.
You got a room
full of rabid Cylon-types
that can't wait to hear
the next chapter of their life story.
I think they're hoping
for a musical.
So you better hurry up
and get better.
They're starting
to look a little mean.
- Don't bother.
- Excuse me?
There's almost no brain activity.
He doesn't hear you.
He's not in there.
Give me the chief.
This is the chief.
Chief...
Do whatever you have to do
to save our girl.
Yes, sir.
<i>{\Previously on </i>
Battlestar Galactica...}
I started thinking
about damages you can't see.
Hairline fractures in all the beams.
It's throughout the entire ship.
It's our baby, Saul.
We'd come to believe
that a lack of God's love
is what prevented us
from biological reproduction.
And our love produced a child.
- Let him go now. Take him now.
- Saul, stay with the fleet.
It's all starting to happen,
it's the miracle right here.
Stay with the fleet!
Ellen, you're the Fifth.
- What are you doing?
- Forgiving you.
- Is this gonna work?
- I have no idea, sir.
This is the stuff?
Yeah.
- Can I touch it?
- Yeah.
It's gooey.
But it... hardens.
Becomes like cartilage.
It's flexible, strong.
It's what the baseship's made of.
Is this alive?
Heads up.
Heads up, marines.
Stay back.
Stay back and everyone
will get their share!
Stay back!
Everyone'll get their share.
Hey, Cylon.
- I don't want any trouble.
- Well, you got trouble.
This better work.
Kid's got a heart
like a kettle drum.
Go on, get out of here.
Make room for some sick people.
You should stay here for the night.
I don't trust that machine.
I know.
The irony is irresistible.
The baby's fine.
Liam is fine.
You know I'd sleep better at home
with you.
Sitrep.
Sir, we're picking up
a bogey on dradis.
Raptor. Squawks colonial,
but it's not on the roster.
It's one of ours, but we logged it
as lost over a year ago, sir.
<i>Galactica, permission to board.</i>
Raptor 702,
your transmission's all garbled.
If you can hear me, give me a flash.
Copy, 702. Galactica,
<i>they're receiving.</i>
Red leader, Red Turkey, the voice.
I think that's an Eight.
Starbuck, Galactica actual.
- <i>Report.</i>
- Galactica, Red leader.
Our heavy raider buddy's
calling the inbound a "Sharon".
An Eight.
Starbuck, bring it in.
<i>Copy that.</i>
My Gods.
It's Ellen Tigh.
Bill.
How many dead chicks are out there?
I can't tell you
how happy I am to see you.
Aren't you gonna help a lady
down off this thing?
Nice to see you again.
This is Boomer.
Marines.
Take this number Eight to the brig.

He wants to rebuild resurrection.
He wants us
to rebuild it.
I really think Cavil's
completely unbalanced.
It's too much for him,
the thought that the...
The only hope for the Cylon people
is this desperate grab
for procreation, evolution,
all that messy biological
trial and error.
Dear.
I'm totally throwing you, aren't I?
I'm still Ellen, you know.
Does anyone have something to drink?
Maybe a flask?
So Boomer helped you escape.
Yes. I hope
you won't treat her too badly.
You don't need
to worry about Boomer.
May I see them?
The others?
Galen, Tory, and Sam?
Imagine,
Bill, Laura, imagine...
instead of...
50,000 survivors,
there are only five.
Five people.
Imagine how close you'd be.
And then to have all that torn away.
It's all right, Ellen.
It's over now.
How much do you remember?
Not much from before.
Flashes.
Samuel Anders was badly injured.
He's not responding.
- My God.
- He's not dead.
- There's hope.
- I want to see him.
I want to see him and the others.
We'll see what we can do.
I can't believe
you're here.
There is so much I have to ask you.
There's so...
I have to tell you.
You'd better say it fast.
Ellen, wait.
- Floor or table?
- I don't care.
Gaius!
Jeanne.
- Welcome back.
- I missed you. Let me look at you.
Paulla.
We were wondering
if you were coming back.
If?
Of course I was coming back!
Course I was.
So.
What did I miss?
What's been going on?
Well, it got pretty bad
after you left, Gaius.
They'd bring us supplies and men
would come and take them away by force.
It was...
We were very tired, Gaius.
We realized we'd been abandoned
and we had
to take care of ourselves.
Abandoned?
I... How could you...
- I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't say...
- Abandoned by God.
That I might. I might say that.
There were dead men in the halls
with guns in their hands.
So we took their guns.
Now we can protect our food
and we can protect ourselves.
All of this...
All of this is food, Gaius.
We're taking care of ourselves now.
I knew if I stayed away
that you'd find the strength.
And you have.
It's one of the reasons
why I stayed away as long as I did.
That was wise of you, Gaius.
Sheep have a new shepherd, Gaius.
That's what I call a big welcome.
Very impressive.
So who'd you frak?
What?
Come on.
You don't think I know your repertoire
after thousands of years of marriage?
It's okay. I'm not mad.
You thought I was dead.
- Ellen.
- Who was it?
Well, if you really...
It was a Six.
Caprica-Six.
We made Sixes.
- We created her. That's just...
- I thought of you.
Always.
- I thought of you.
- What do you mean? When you...
Please do not tell me
I was your mental porn.
That's just sad.
- Well, are you still seeing her?
- Yes.
Lot of visitors.
Just don't anybody unplug anything.
Oh, my.
I never thought I would see this.
Yes,
this is how it was.
Tory.
Galen.
All those years.
The poor boy.
Such bad timing.
We've been thinking.
We belong together.
Join us on the baseship.
We'll jump away. Start a new life.
Please consider the offer.
It would mean so much to us.
Abandon the fleet.
This is your offer?
The priority of the fleet
is the survival...
The survival of humans.
We're not safe in this fleet.
- Even today a Cylon was assaulted.
- I agree.
This is about the survival
of the original 13th tribe
in its purest form.
Did you put this idea
in their heads?
It won't work, of course.
The child, Hera, is the hope
for a new blended future.
That used to be true.
But now there's another way.
Caprica-Six's unborn baby
is pure Cylon.
We can rebuild
a pure Cylon civilization.
Even if we don't find
a planet to colonize,
we can live indefinitely
on the baseship.
Look at him.
He'd die over there.
We can take care of him
better than here.
The Cylon family can survive.
We can start over.
Caprica-Six
is pregnant?
- You got her pregnant?
- I... I did. Yeah.
I didn't know.
- I was surprised.
- It was a great surprise to all of us.
The mating of an original Cylon.
You are our children.
Can we talk about the offer,
maybe deal with the baby later?
Are we going or...?
Of course not.
Anders specifically said
"Do not abandon the fleet."
- So you love her then.
- Last thing he ever said.
He's not saying anything now.
I'm going with the baseship.
Even after you knew...
- For frak's sake.
- You made us all filthy in this.
You just can't stop poisoning me.
Poison more and more of it
until I'm swimming in it!
- Stop this.
- I'm staying on Galactica. You hear me?
- You can go if you're so mad.
- Wait.
We won't leave
with just one or two of the Five.
It has to be all of you
or none of you.
So you need to vote
and the outcome will bind all of you.
Majority rule.
It's what Cylons do.
It's a legacy from you.
Fine. So it's a vote?
All right. I vote we go.
Great. That's me and you.
We don't really know
what Anders would vote.
Yeah, we do. He said he'd stay.
All those years
we tried to have children
and we never could.
You must've been laughing
your shiny, shiny head off.
It was impossible.
You didn't love me.
So what are you saying?
Do you vote to stay or to go?
I haven't decided yet.
Two to go. Two to stay.
And the swing vote
is walking out the door.
We come to Dogsville more often now.
We don't feel the need to cut ourselves
off from the rest of the world.
We trade here. Sometimes,
we sell the jewelry that we made.
That's how we got so much food.
Yes, Jeanne.
Since you've been gone,
we've been trying to focus on life.
Gaius, come on.
Hello.
What's your name?
Naia.
Naia.
That's a very beautiful name.
And who's this?
Stand up.
Stand up.
This is Gaius.
Really? I'm very flattered...
It was his father's name.
To have the same name as his father.
It's very...
Are you hungry?
You look a bit hungry.
He's hungry?
- They're all hungry.
- Are they?
Paulla, we've got some food,
haven't we?
To share with this lot of people?
We're gonna need it eventually
to eat, to trade.
We can't.
Really, Paulla.
Are we going to enjoy this food
with children starving?
Now ask yourself
this question really.
Look aroun, look at these childr...
It's not just this child here.
This...
Little Gaius.
But he is very cute, this one.
It's all the children, isn't it?
All of them.
And you're putting the food...
Listen to me!
Listen to me!
I'm coming back here.
And if it is the last thing I do,
I will ensure
that every single one of you are fed
and your children are fed,
as God is my witness!
Caprica.
That's funny. I don't think
I've ever called you a name before.
I think you probably called me
some names.
I haven't had the chan...
No, I haven't taken the opportunity
to congratulate you and the baby.
I just wondered if everything
was all right with Ellen being back.
I heard about the assault
in Dogsville.
And on behalf of the fleet,
I wanted to apologize to you.
Thank you.
It's very kind of you.
Caprica, sometimes
I think about the visions
that we shared and the talk...
we had.
I haven't had one in a while.
Have you?
Not the whole time
I've been pregnant.
That never occurred to me.
Are you saying that this ch...
What?
Is this child important?
Yes, I think he's very important.
He's my baby and I love him.
He's very important to me.
Of course he is.
Of course, all children are important.
Yes. Indeed.
Thank you for asking about him.
You're welcome.
When'd you get a piano?
Gin.
You see Ellen and Tigh
on the wing of that bird?
It's like watching
my parents make out.
You go see Boomer in the brig yet?
No.
You should go when she's asleep.
I watched Sam until I just
couldn't handle the fun anymore.
There you are.
Look at you.
You haven't changed much.
How did you get the guards
to bring you here?
I thought maybe we could have a drink.
Where's the booze?
- I have tea.
- God no.
Listen, I wanted to talk to you.
Things between me and Saul
just got so crazy.
I step off that Raptor and boom,
we're making love.
And
less than a day later, I'm...
I'm screaming at him.
But we were always, always,
always like that.
Anyway, I just...
I wanted to assure you.
He didn't tell you about the sex.
Frak.
I'm...
I come here to try to be good and...
Look.
Don't worry.
Seriously. Because
you have all the proof right there
that he loves you.
You know, when we were still trying
to have our own,
he always brought up
the name "Liam".
Pure Cylon baby.
If Simon knew,
he'd want it so badly.
I'll take care of this child.
That wasn't a threat, Caprica.
No.
It was a threat.
I don't know why
you couldn't have children, Ellen.
Sometimes love must
not be enough because he loved you.
Yes, this...
This is rough.
But what can I do?
If I make him choose
between you and me,
I know the best I could do
would be to tear him in half.
Don't.
I won't.
You win.
The man loves you.
In fact, I'd say there isn't much
he loves more.
Here you go, Gaius. Here you go.
Here you go. Take that to mommy.
Here you go. There you go.
The marines tried this already, Gaius,
and people started pushing and grabbing.
The marines have assault rifles,
not handguns.
Look around you, Paulla, will you?
Look around.
Can you see anybody rioting?
Can you? No.
- There's no uniforms here.
- Come, come.
There's no sense of oppression.
It's just...
It's just one soul touching another,
isn't it?
Well, we need the food.
Paulla, when you share your food,
God makes it tenfold.
You watch me.
You're going to learn something.
You're gonna want
to step away from those.
Really?
And who will you be?
Step away from the supplies.
Ladies,
show this man we are armed.
Do it.
Take it off the safety, Jeanne.
Ours are bigger.
Careful...
So the five of you together at last.
Any...
mythic revelations?
Nope. Nothing to report, sir.
- You were born, right, Saul?
- What?
You were born.
On Earth. Yeah.
I don't remember.
But...
I wouldn't anyway.
Nature of the process, right?
Not very machine-like of you.
Great grandpa was a power sander.
They're puttin' the stuff into her.
- The Cylon goop you said.
- Yeah.
If it works,
she'll still be the Galactica
on the outside, but...
She won't know what she is anymore.
It'll save her.
That along with Cylons flying cap.
We need their help.
I need your help.
Laura and Lee know it.
They don't think I see it.
But I do.
I see it.
You never told me that the Sons of Aries
were involved in this.
Of course they are, Gai.
Did you think they would stay
out of something
as valuable as food supplies?
Well, you didn't want to be
king of the fools anymore.
No, the only thing worse
than being leader of this lot...
would be being one of them.
Did you really want to feed
those people?
I enjoyed it, actually. I did enjoy
giving.
I loved it, actually.
The more I did it...
Done it long enough,
I'd have given them my heart.
Well, do you think she's...
telling them anything as moving as that?
Do you think she's giving them hope?
She's not, is she?
What's Paulla been saying to you?
Has Paulla been saying
that we mustn't help others?
Because...
I disagree.
Has Paulla been saying
that we can't
help others because we're too weak?
I disagree.
Oh, Paulla.
I am so disappointed with you.
I'm disappointed with all of you.
Here you all are.
I'm gone for three minutes
and you're lapping up Paulla's
icy pragmatism.
There is a way to feed ourselves
and the people from Dogsville!
There is a way to bring hope
to the lower decks.
To the whole of this poor ship.
There is a way to win!
She thinks
we can't get what we need.
She thinks
we can't get what we need.
All we need is strength.
All we need is strength!
And strength
comes from within.
We can get more guns.
Better guns. Bigger guns.
And guns!
More guns. Bigger guns.
Better guns.
And when we have those,
we will win!
Thanks for seeing me alone.
I just...
- I have to talk to you.
- Of course.
Hate me, i'll take it.
But this is bigger than that.
Galactica needs the baseship.
Why did you even
make love to me, Saul,
when your real love was at home?
Did you even hear what I said?
Bill needs the baseship.
I heard you.
Did you hear me?
Her brush is where mine used to be.
My dresses are gone.
She shares our bed.
Do you remember,
I got us that mattress.
You went to my quarters.
Not interrupting?
Not at all. I was expecting you.
You called him?
Good. Come on in.
You too, Caprica.
What is this?
We're joining the baseship.
All of us.
- We can jump away when you're ready.
- Thank you.
- It's the right decision.
- No.
No, it's not. No.
The vote is you and Anders
versus me, Tory
and Galen.
Caprica, obviously,
that means you have to come too.
Wouldn't you like
to raise your child where it's safe?
I want him to be safe, yes.
She doesn't understand
what this means.
I used to think Hera
was the only hope for us.
But clearly
that's just not true anymore.
Her baby, he's pure Cylon.
If we go off and make
some pure Cylon culture,
that's what happened on Earth
and it led to disaster.
Pure human doesn't work.
Pure Cylon doesn't work.
It's too weak.
You just don't want to leave
the one you really love.
What?
- Talk to me. What is this?
- It's petty and vile.
Enough. She's voted.
When's the jump?
We can be ready in an hour.
- I'm not goin'.
- We agreed on majority rule.
Frak, apparently
we invented majority rule.
But I don't remember it,
so frak that.
Saul, don't let her...
All right, go. Go.
All of you.
Caprica. Go.
Go be pure and safe and whatever
- the frak. I'm not goin'.
- Do you see, little girl?
There is something in the universe
that he loves far more than you
or me...
And that's Bill Adama.
You don't even want to go.
This is all to hurt me.
- Bill Adama, the ship and the uniform.
- How can you sink so low?
- Everything else takes second place.
- Why doing this?
I knew I did.
But I always wondered
if a baby would.
Guess I know now.
Something's wrong...
Get Cottle.
You'll be okay.
Never seen anyone
get into trouble so fast,
but he's fighting back.
That's all I can tell you.
- I didn't mean this.
- Yeah, you did.
Here, this may help
increase his heart rate.
You knew how I would have to choose.
You knew what it meant.
I'm sorry.
Of course, Cylons and humans
need to stay together.
But I always intended... I just...
I didn't think.
Saul, I only wanted to hurt you,
- not her.
- You didn't think I would hurt her,
if I let her go.
It never occurred to you?
No wonder we had to invent them
some compassionate god to believe in.
We couldn't have them deify us,
could we?
- We didn't invent anything.
- Shut up. Just stop!
I'm so sorry.
Maybe...
I just shouldn't be here.
First intelligent thing you've said.
Talk to her.
Tell her you love her.
It's what she needs.
It's what the baby needs.
Listen.
I love you,
all right?
Can you hear me?
This is nonsense. She knows it.
I don't need to say it.
I shouldn't need to say it to anyone.
Isn't it enough that I feel it?
- Just tell her.
- I feel it.
For her. For you. For Liam.
Shouldn't need to spout the words.
I feel it less with words.
Just let me Gods damn feel it
and I'll fill the frakkin' room.
His heart rate is dropping.
I got signs of distress all over.
Doesn't look good.
I am so sorry.
Cut him out.
Even if it kills me.
He'll live
if you cut him out right now.
Cylon babies must be strong, right?
Hera was born early.
Cut him out.
I am not cutting you. Forget it.
He'll never make it. Four months?
- No.
- Please.
Caprica, listen,
I have to tell you.
He loves you
more than he ever loved me.
You are the mother of his son.
The boy is alive. I can see
his heartbeat on the monitor.
And that's proof.
Proof he loves you.
He loves you so much.
It's shining out of him.
You and he can stay on Galactica.
I'll go away with the others.
And you can be together.
A little family.
I promise it.
That's it. I'm sorry.
No, that was me.
That was me.
I take it back. I'm sorry.
The lady and I have some work to do.
It's time for you to leave.
You have to go now.
Nurse!
Out now.
She's in good hands.
The two of you can stay here
and listen to this.
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go to the head.
Do something constructive.
A little project I've been working on.
Listen to me, Admiral.
Just wait.
Explain what you mean.
What you have right now
is starving civilians
with no representation, no recourse.
They're broken.
They're exhausted.
They've had enough.
That's not a mutiny, Admiral.
- That is a revolution.
- And you can maintain order?
Listen to me. List...
Please, Admiral!
Galactica is slipping away from you
drop by drop.
You are pouring Cylon blood
into her veins.
I see the Cylon pilots.
We all see them.
We all see the Cylon workforce.
Where are they going
into the far recesses of the ship?
When are you inviting
the Centurions over to join
in all the fun we're having over here?
Of course, when you do that,
that very moment,
this becomes a blended ship.
Only half human.
And right now
I am here to tell you, your people...
Your people are not ready for that.
Listen to me, Admiral.
I am offering you
the last human solution
you will ever be presented with.
Well, guys, you did it.
I don't know how, but you did.
I told you, Paulla. I told you.
You do good deeds
and you are rewarded.
You're rewarded ten... Tenfold.
And then if you give...
Then you receive, don't you?
That was beautiful.
I'm sorry.
Liam.
His name was Liam.
It's a good name.
- Short for William.
- Yeah.
It's not like that. I know.
I know it's not.
I know.
It's okay.
It's okay.
These are the Cylons that have died
with us since the alliance.
I didn't know they were doing that.
Did you?
It's already happened, hasn't it?
<i>Previously on </i>
Battlestar Galactica...
Hairline fractures in all the beams.
Her bones are rotten. There's something
on the baseship that can help.
It's this organic resin.
It'll grow into the metal.
Strengthens it as it matures.
Oh, my Gods.
It's Ellen Tigh.
Nice to see you again.
This is Boomer.
Marines.
Take this number Eight to the brig.
If that's me lying there,
then what am I?
What am I?
<i>Reveille, reveille.
Up all bunks and turn two.</i>
<i>Sweep down all compartments.
Empty all trash cans.</i>
<i>Make a clean sweep fore and aft.</i>
<i>Lay below to the master-at-arms office
for muster,</i>
<i>all restricted personnel.</i>
Attention on deck.
Have a seat.
It's 0621.
Sync with me in three, two, one.
Hack 0621.
Our mission is the same this week...
as it was the week before that,
and the week before that.
We'll be flying Viper CAPs
in conjunction
with heavy Raider pickets
from the baseship.
Those of you who just came back
from six-day planet hunts
will get two days local duty
before going out again.
Remember, the first one
who sights a habitable rock
will get this fine
oral hygiene product.
It is the last tube of Tauran toothpaste
in the universe.
Gods know most of you need it.
Our mission is the same this week
as it was the week before that,
and the week before that.
Planet hunters, make sure to draw
long duration provisions.
If those clapped-out FTLs
go down when you're out there,
you're gonna get mighty hungry waiting
for the SAR birds to find you.
As you know,
the mutiny has thinned our ranks.
We cannot give
all you Raptor jocks back-seaters.
Savor this alone time,
but do not whack too much.
We need you to conserve your O˛.
Learn to savor your alone time.
Wank as little as possible.
Conserve your O˛.
Planet search assignments
are on the duty board.
Be advised the repairs
to Galactica will continue
to cause sporadic power outages.
Six has the color assignments
and your recognition signals.
Engines start at 0710.
Good hunting.
So the stop-drilling
and the shoring compound
will buy the Galactica
a few more jumps.
But not many.
- How many?
- Impossible to say...
until the hull caves in.
But we're not ready
to give up on the old girl just yet.
Well, if there's nothing else,
Sonja...
I wanna congratulate you
on your election.
I look forward to seeing you
taking your seat
in the Quorum of ship's captains
next week.
Thank you,
but you should know something.
When we convene, I intend to formally
request that the Eight you're holding
in Galactica's brig...
be returned to us.
- Boomer?
- Yes, Sharon Valerii.
She put two holes in me.
I'm afraid I didn't word that right.
We don't want Boomer set free.
We wanna try Boomer for treason.
Sharon Valerii sided with Cavil
in the Cylon civil war,
which killed thousands
of our comrades.
And if she's convicted?
Before the civil war, resurrection
made capital punishment pointless.
But now that we're all mortal...
You want to kill her.

- There's a lot still going on in there.
- Dr. Gerard said these readings
are unprecedented and,
frankly, bizarre.
They haven't changed in weeks.
And there is nothing to indicate that
he's having any conscious thought.
Well, maybe his brain is rebooting.
Reorganizing as it heals.
The last thing we need is you jerking
our chains with a lotta quack ideas.
Why don't you take them
someplace else?
What if we could link him
to a datastream like our hybrids?
His eyes were closed last time.
Well, that's not unusual in a coma.
Doesn't mean anything.
You're gonna have
to come to grips with that.
And how am I supposed to do that?
You need to get on with your life.
If there's any change,
you'll be the first one to know.
Gods damn it.
Do you have to continue
to play the same lame-ass song?
Give it a rest.
I'm not playing the same lame-ass song.
I'm composing it.
Been at it for four days now.
It's hell.
So then quit. What's the point?
The point?
The point is to bring a little grace
and beauty to an otherwise
- ugly and brutal existence.
- Gimme a frakking break.
Is that what you were doing when
the Cylons attacked the 12 colonies?
Did your music stop one missile?
Pretty cynical point of view.
Something happened to you.
Yeah.
I wonder what it could be.
Closing time.
Drink up and let's go, folks.
I have an observation for you.
You wanna be an immortal composer,
you better learn how to play that thing.
You know, sometimes at work,
I try to conjure up
what your face looks like.
Curve of your lips.
Way your hair falls.
How you smell.
You see my face every day.
Yeah, but not like this.
- You know, what we had...
- it was nothing.
Nothing.
You're a machine. I'm not.
Well, whatever I am,
I know how I felt.
Software doesn't have feelings.
How many of us ended up with the people
we really wanted to be with?
Got stuck with the best
of limited options?
And why?
Because the ones we really wanted...
that we really loved
were dead, dying...
I love you, Chief.
Gods damn it.
Come on, people,
you can't draw
your power from the same bus!
- You said you had something for me.
- Come in.
I got something
that'll cheer you up.
Hey, Hera.
Whatcha drawing, stars?
Those are very good stars.
Thank you.
Recognize any of this?
That's my stuff.
- When we all thought you were dead...
- The pilots auctioned it off, I know.
Took me a while but I managed
to buy, beg, and steal them back.
That for me?
Thank you.
Thank you.
What about the rest?
Keep it.
<i>Thank God.</i>
<i>I don't know why i'm here.</i>
<i>You know, when I shot the old man,</i>
<i>the things that you said to me...</i>
the way that you looked at me...
<i>I thought New Caprica
was a way to set things right.</i>
<i>You can't force people to love you
at the point of a gun.</i>
<i>I know that now.</i>
<i>But at the time I felt betrayed.</i>
<i>So I wanted to forget you...</i>
<i>and hate you.</i>
<i>Didn't work.</i>
<i>I've thought about you every day
since that moment I died in your arms.</i>
<i>Me too.</i>
<i>If I had known back then
what I am...</i>
<i>I know.</i>
<i>Galen, it's okay, really.</i>
<i>I mean, the most important thing
is that we both know who we are now.</i>
<i>Let's make the most
with the time that we have left.</i>
<i>Please?</i>
What the hell is this?
Our house.
On Picon.
It's the one that we planned to build
when we mustered out.
Stop it.
<i>Stop this.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, Galen.</i>
I thought you'd be okay
with Cylon projection.
The critic returns.
I thought I'd see
if you were making any progress.
You tell me.
It's longer.
Lotta notes.
- You hate it?
- I didn't say that.
You were savagely honest with me
the other night.
- Why be diplomatic now?
- I'm not being diplomatic,
you oversensitive jackass.
I said I liked it.
Really?
Why?
It's hard to put into words.
Made me think of...
someone chasing after a car.
Not exactly what I was going for.
I was trying to convey
a sense of loss.
That's...
that's what I meant.
It's like losing someone
that you care about.
Their car pulls away. You...
You chase 'em.
But they're going too fast.
So that's it?
We're just gonna sit on our hands?
- Let our people kill her for vengeance?
- What do you expect us to do?
Issue a formal decree of clemency?
We can't interfere.
We can't set ourselves up as Gods.
The rebels
are the aggrieved parties.
They have every right
to determine Valerii's...
- Can't!
- ... punishement.
Boomer saved your life.
You wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for her.
And I will testify to that at her trial,
but I won't try to stop it.
We have
to let justice run its course.
Then they will
kill her.
Sure as hell.
We're all in hell.
- Thanks for your input, Colonel.
- He just lost his child.
You leave him be.
<i>How long you been...</i>
<i>Going there?</i>
<i>A while.</i>
Became my secret retreat.
<i>A way of feeling close to you.</i>
Do you remember
<i>how we obsessed
over every little detail?</i>
<i>That was...</i>
<i>You...</i>
<i>obsessing. I was just...</i>
<i>Listening.</i>
<i>Really?</i>
<i>How many floor plans did you draw?</i>
<i>That's...</i>
<i>being thorough.</i>
We never had a chance to build it,
<i>so I built it in my head.</i>
<i>And I wanted so much
to share it with you.</i>
<i>Are you sure?
I don't want to put you through any...</i>
We've nailed the first movement.
Now how about the second?
It's okay, it's just the next hurdle.
The key is to, you know, not panic.
Just trust yourself
something's gonna come.
It's just part of the process.
Is part of the process
also stealing from other composers?
That piece you're riffing off of,
it's Nomion's 3rd Sonata, 2nd movement.
I mean,
it's what it sounded like anyway.
No you're dead on the money.
It's pronounced "no-mayan".
Anyway, he's my touchstone.
Whenever I come up dry,
I look to him for inspiration.
And for somebody who hates music
so much, you know an awful lot about it.
My dad used to play.
So what's the story?
He forced you to learn,
and he was such a perfectionist,
you grew to hate it?
No, I loved it... actually.
He used to sit me next to him
on the bench when he played.
Smell of tobacco on his breath.
He taught me a few songs.
I used to try
so hard to get 'em right.
Not because I was afraid he'd get angry,
but because I knew he'd be so proud.
There was this one song that
he taught me.
It made me feel happy
and sad all at the same time.
The best ones do.
How is it possible that I found my body
and I'm still here?
I mean, what am I?
A ghost? A demon?
You're asking the wrong guy.
I'm just a piano player.
When I was leading
the fleet to Earth,
everything seemed so clear.
For the first time in my life,
I knew what I was doing
and why I was here.
Now I'm just adrift again.
Listen,
you may feel like hell.
But sometimes lost
is where you need to be.
Just because
you don't know your direction
doesn't mean you don't have one.
Madam President.
I'm asking you
as a personal favor to me,
don't sign that.
Don't do that, Chief.
Personal feelings are what
Sharon Valerii preys upon.
You know that
better than any of us.
You need to clear your head.
You don't have to kill her.
Leave her in the brig.
She is a danger in the brig,
out of the brig.
A danger to us,
a danger to our Cylon allies.
This can't be the last option,
Madam, please.
Madam President, please.
We're done here,
Chief.
You're dismissed.
Somebody check the fuse.
What?
- What, that was good.
- It's crap.
Maybe you need to take a break.
Get yourself laid or something.
That might dissipate the tension.
That why she left you?
That's a pretty deep groove
on your finger.
Had to have been there for a while.
Too long.
- She didn't leave me, I left her.
- Why?
She wanted me to quit
playing the piano.
You left her for that?
I was playing steady gigs.
Making decent money.
Now that we had a kid,
she said it wasn't enough.
Said I had to get a real job.
I told her I might as well
cut my heart out.
My Gods, you're just like my father.
You start a family,
the going gets tough, you ditch 'em.
Did you ever stop thinking
about yourself long enough
to consider
what you did to your kid?
<i>You got it. Thanks, Chief.</i>
<i>Every time the godsdamn power goes out,
we gotta go down and check the locks.</i>
Prisoner's still secure.
She slept right through it.
You gonna stay a while?
Word is they're shipping her out
tomorrow.
Said all I needed to say.
So maybe what your old man did
was wrong.
But he still left you
with something.
He taught you how to play the piano.
I never played after he left.
What about that song?
That song he taught you.
The one that makes you happy and sad
at the same time. Play that for me.
I don't frakking remember it.
And even if I did, I wouldn't.
That son-of-a-bitch never came back.
He never called. He never wrote.
So you quit playing to punish him?
Come on, play me a song.
It won't hurt. Come on.
I'll show you. It's easy.
Come on.
Don't make me hurt you.
Here we go.
That goes there.
And that goes there.
Go ahead.
It's okay.
- It's okay.
- You play, please.
I'll play.
I'll play if you play.
Great.
I hope you're here
to fix the frakking shower.
Boomer.
Athena.
Helo.
- I didn't think...
- You didn't think I'd let you go
on a six-day mission in deep space
without a proper goodbye, did you?
Next flight team's not suiting up
for another 20.
You smell good.
I made a trade for some real soap.
Taste as good as it smells?
Something wrong?
Cottle was right. I never should have
insisted on seeing him.
His eyes were open.
I wasn't ready for that.
Little guy was looking right at me.
It's all right, I think...
I think you almost had it.
Something's missing.
It's the left hand.
I'll play down here.
I think I know what you're doing.
Now hang on.
Holy crap.
That's right.
Play the bottom, okay?
Come in when you think you're ready.
Hey, baby.
Hi.
Guess what mommy brought you?
Drink it all, yeah. Good, right?
We forgot
all about her physical today.
Let me give you a hand with that.
Easy, easy, Chief.
Thanks.
What the frak?
That's the song.
- Where'd you learn to play that song?
- I played it as a kid.
My father...
What are you talking about?
Who did this?
Come with me.
I can't do it without you.
Yeah, you can.
We'll meet again.
There's something
I want you to remember.
All the things that I said...
about us.
I meant them with all my heart.
So no matter what happens...
He fired
before he acquired the target,
gave away his position,
that was the end of him.
So don't let this happen to you.
During this exercise,
we could have 6 or 8 ships
hitting the merge
where the fight starts.
So keep your head on a swivel,
especially in the vertical.
Oh, my Gods, Athena.
In the locker room. It was Boomer.
Did she get Hera?
Six, get a med team here
right frakking now.
K-ro, get on the horn to CIC
and let 'em know Boomer's loose.
She's got my frakking kid!
LSO, Athena, what's the delay
with my flight clearance?
<i>Please hold, Raptor 719.</i>
<i>We're still waiting
for traffic to clear your flight path.</i>
<i>Stand by for instructions.</i>
Come on.
She's not buying it, sir.
She initiated prestart.
Boomer, this is Galactica actual.
<i>Return to checkers red
and shut down.</i>
Copy.
Hoshi.
Vector the CAP to intercept.
Blue leader, Galactica. Immediate.
Proceed directly to Galactica.
Engage Raptor two-one-niner.
<i>Weapons free.</i>
<i>Blue flight, rolling in hot.</i>
If you launch, Boomer,
<i>I will shoot you down.</i>
I don't think you wanna do that
while I have Hera on board.
We can't let her get off this ship.
Retract the flight pods.
Sir, she's spooling to jump.
If she jumps inside the ship,
the spatial disruption
could tear Galactica's guts out.
Retract the flight pods.
Retract flight pods.
I say again, retract flight pods.
Don't do it.
<i>Don't do it, don't do it!</i>
Frak!
Hera.
I need a team, scaffolding,
shoring compound
to the forward magazine right away!
<i>One Eight looks like another.</i>
<i>How did a three-year old girl
get by you, though?</i>
- The hell's going on up there?
- Boomer took her kid.
What?
She took Hera
and just walked out of the daycare.
<i>How do you let a three-year old girl
climb into a Raptor?</i>
<i>How did she get by you?</i>
<i>I'm sorry, sir,
but nobody saw your daughter.</i>
<i>That's impossible!
Somebody saw her!</i>
<i>She's a three-year old child.
Explain to me how she gets by...</i>
Had to be orchestrated
from the beginning.
My escape, all of it.
I was just a means
to get Boomer here.
Cavil wanted Hera.
Boomer got her for him.
How can a three-year old girl
spontaneously write down that song?
She's plugged into something
that's manipulating all of us.
Maybe Anders could help us.
If he ever wakes up.
<i>Previously on </i>
Battlestar Galactica...
What am I?
A ghost, a demon?
You're asking the wrong guy.
I'm just a piano player.
- That for me?
- Here.
Holy crap.
Sam!
- There's a lot still going on in there.
- And there is nothing
to indicate that's he's having
any kind of conscious thought.
What if we could link him
to the data stream? Like our hybrids?
We have to figure out
a contingency plan for the ship now.
You have to face the fact
that you're gonna lose her.
Boomer's loose.
She's got my frakkin' kid!
Get on the horn to CIC
and alert the Admiral.
- Sir, Boomer's spooling to jump.
- If she jumps,
the spatial disruption
could tear Galactica's guts out.
What have you been bitching about?
It's not our fault the resin
won't bond with your alloys.
In other words, it's our fault that
this goop of yours isn't doing crap,
except making this place
smell like the inside of a latrine.
Really? I thought that was you.
Lady, you work on your side,
and I'll work on mine!
Come on.
Come on, not with this guy. Not now.
- Stop your bitching!
- Not now.
- Fine! Fine!
- Come on, let's go.
If John's plan all along was
to steal Hera so he could study her...
Study her? They're gonna dissect her
like a lab rat and we all know it.
If he wants to try to determine
what made her
a successful human/Cylon hybrid,
he'll take her to the Colony.
The Colony?
I guess you could call it home.
It's where we and the Centurions
went after the first war,
once we convinced them
to abandon their own experiments
with evolution in exchange
for resurrection technology.
She knows where it is.
So you would have the Galactica
jump into a Cylon's hornets' nest,
risk everything,
for one solitary, single child.
- Is that what you're telling me?
- She's not just any child.
With Caprica Six's miscarriage,
Hera is our people's only hope
of avoiding eventual extinction.
She may be our only hope, too.
I just ex...
We just experienced
something remarkable.
Hera wrote the notes to a song.
A song that my father used to play to me
when I was a child.
The same song that switched us on
when we were in that nebula.
The same song that led us to Earth.
Something is happening here,
something greater than all of us,
and that little girl
is in the middle of it.
She's the key, sir.
In other words, it's our destiny
to go after her, right?
Wrong.
I've had it up to here with destiny,
prophecy,
with God or the Gods.
Look where it's left us.
The ass end of nowhere,
nearly half of our people are gone,
Earth, a worthless cinder,
and I can't even
walk down the halls of my ship
without wondering if I'm gonna catch
a bullet for getting us into this mess.
We're alive, Bill.
Four years ago,
I wouldn't have taken odds on that.
At least give us a recon bird.
We can see what we're up against.
Make it a heavy Raider.
I don't want Helo and Athena
to find out about this.
Look at me.
Look at me.
Look at me.
You hate me, don't you?
Say it.
Say it.
Gods frakkin' damn it.
Hera?
Hera!
Hera!
Bill, I've been having
that dream again.
Help me!
Grab him!
Get him!
Grab the door!
Lock it!
Lock it!

Got internal bleeding, Doc.
Taking her to surgery.
- Right. I hope we don't lose power.
- What's the tally?
61 dead or missing so far,
including 26 of theirs.
The Leobens are calling it
the proverbial straw.
Say we've got five more jumps, max.
After that, there's a 90% chance
of tearing her in half.
I don't want to hear
that you are 90% sure of anything.
You come back when you are 100% sure,

Transferring to her baseship?
That'll be the frakkin' day.
That's exactly what I said.
I'll get on on top

Must be tough saying to good-bye

will be our sole means of defense.
Under the Admiral's command,
augmented by Galactica's pilots,
planes, and military personnel

Mr. Adama,
but it sure seems like
we're putting a lot of power

And I use the term loosely...
Who not so long ago were doing
their damndest to wipe us out!
- And your concerns are noted.
- As you all know...
Let me speak!
As you all know, we agreed to accept
Admiral Adama's military authority
in return for a seat
on this council.
- We intend to abide by that promise.
- Speaking of promises,
I have been complaining about air
quality aboard Hitei Kan from day one.
I am submitting my requisition now
for Galactica's CO˛
and particulate scrubbers.
- Excuse me?
- As long as we get the FTLs.
Our last emergency jump,
it took us six minutes to spin up!
- Wait a minute.
- Obviously we will have to do
a complete inventory
of Galactica's equipment.
Maybe even a lottery
in order to ensure
an equitable distribution
of all the equipment.
Now listen to me
for one Gods damn minute!
No one removes so much as one bolt
from this Battlestar,
not until the Admiral
tells us we can.
Really!
What does Gaius Baltar
say about that?
Gaius Baltar?
<i>Angels.</i>
<i>Angels, I hear you say?</i>
<i>I don't believe
that angels appear to you</i>
<i>in some mystical, spectral form.</i>
<i>Angels take the guise</i>
<i>of those who are nearest
and dearest to you,</i>
<i>those who can understand your doubts</i>
<i>and your trials,</i>
<i>and steer you back
on the road to salvation.</i>
<i>I believe in these angels</i>
because I see them.
Wherever you are in the fleet,
this is Gaius Baltar
wishing you a beautiful day.
Excuse me.
Caprica? Caprica Six!
It's...
It's good to...
Listen, I heard about...
your loss,
and I want to offer you
my condolences,
- tell you how truly sorry I am.
- Thank you, Gaius.
I see...
I see you've got your...
- If you need any more, we have got...
- I'm fine.
I'm also not
unaware of your current situation.
If you need a place to stay...
- I have no desire to join your harem.
- No, No.
That's not what I...
That's not what...
We are trying to make a difference
within the fleet.
You haven't changed,
Gaius, not really.
I have.
- She wants to talk to you.
- Me?
She's dying.
Could you just take a few minutes
out of your busy schedule
and be with her.
Thank you.
Thank me for what?
For the privilege
of finally being able to meet
my father before I die.
You shouldn't be thanking me.
I spent most of my life
trying to kill your kind.
Too much confusion.
I want my mommy.
I want my mommy.
I want my mommy.
Take me home.
It's too bad they never upgraded
the FTL on this relic,
but if you think I'm gonna
put up with your sniveling
and your whining for another
dozen jumps, guess again!
I want my mommy!
Take me home!
Fine!
Let's see if you can cry
in your sleep.
It might be a long snooze, too,
because these
don't come in kiddy doses.
Give me your arm!
You okay?
Saul, it's Hera.
We're got to do more.
I got him to send out
a recon mission.
Yeah, a recon mission.
Our people's future is at stake and
you got him to send out a recon mission.
"Our people".
That's right, Saul.
Thank Gods. Oh, frak.
Empty!
You want to know who my people are,
lady? The ones on this ship.
The ones I fought with
and bled with.
The Old Man, this crew,
they're my family.
The only family I've known,
and the only one I care to.
You're a pip.
You really are.
"Old man".
Old compared to who?
You were my husband 2,000 years
before you even met Bill Adama.
2,000 years, that's a number.
That's what it means to me.
It's nothing.
But that man's friendship...
Oh, frak!
- You're a Cylon, Saul.
- Yeah.
Whether you remember
that life or not,
at least you must understand
what we were trying to do.
We wanted to end the cycle of war
between man and machine.
That was a bust.
Yes, we failed,
but we have a second chance now.
Hera.
Without her,
our children are going
to die off one by one,
just like they're dying
right now in Cottle's sickbay.
I had a child.
He died.
You're wrong, Saul.
You had millions.
Come on, you've got to be hungry.
Eat this.
Do you know what I do sometimes
when I'm sad?
I go to this special place.
A house where I wanted to live
with a man that I loved.
You can see this?
You can project?
Yeah, you can still eat it.
Missed a spot.
By your left sideburn.
The latch was busted.
Thank you.
So...
Do you really believe all that bilge
you were spewing on the wireless?
- Bilge?
- Angels.
The angels walking among us.
The angels that bring out
our better nature, bla bla bla...
I do, as a matter of fact.
And you've seen
these angels for yourself?
With alarming regularity.
Regularity.
That must be important
when you're full of crap.
That's charming.
Absolutely charming.
And you are entitled
to your opinion obviously.
Who are you, by the way again?
Me?
I'm a dead chick, that's who.
All right, and I'm full of crap.
No, I mean it. I'm dead,
as in six feet under dead.
Dead, as in crash-landed,
burned to a crisp dead.
Here.
I took these off my body,
what was left of it,
anyway, on Earth.
Take 'em.
You used to be a scientist.
Run some tests.
Pull out the ol' Cylon detector,
do whatever you need to do,
because I have no idea.
The only thing I know for sure...
I'm not an angel.
We tried hooking him up
to the main power grid.
Thought it might help him
reset his neural net.
So in other words,
you tried to jumpstart him like a car.
Let me guess.
It didn't work so well for you.
- Take a break.
- Someone has to monitor...
I'd like a minute alone with my husband.
I'm sure you don't mind.
It's funny, you know? I...
I remember when
I told you that if
I found out you were a Cylon,
I would
put a bullet in your head.
Some frakker beats me to it,
all I can think about is
how I can get you back.
Human, Cylon,
it doesn't seem to matter.
I just wanted you back...
Because you're just Sam.
You are my Sam.
And that's how I'm gonna
remember you...
The neuroanatomy of fear and faith
share common afferent pathways.
Flip a coin.
Increased vascular pressure
marks the threat response.
Free will scuttles in the swamp of fear.
Do not fear the word.
You are the harbinger of death.
You will lead them all to their end.
End of line.
New command. Resume function...
"And so I walked,
like the beat cop I used to be.
"When you walk,
you see things in different ways.
"But when something's out of place,
you notice.
"A cop's eyes always notice,
"and those eyes
"were one thing
they couldn't take away from me."
What?
Open to page 61.
Don't worry.
Cottle won't mind. It's medicinal.
I can't believe you saved this.
Do you remember that day?
Yes.
New Caprica.
Baltar's ground-breaking.
We talked and talked.
About a lot of things.
Guess what I'm thinking
about right now?
Give me a hint.
Mountains.
A stream running into a little lake.
Water so clear
it's like looking through glass.
Your cabin.
The one you wanted to build.
It's amazing how much
I still think about it.
You know, sometimes I wonder
what home is.
Is it an actual place,
or is it some kind
of longing for something,
some kind of connection.
You know,
I spent my whole life on Caprica.
I was born in one house,
and then I...
I moved to another.
And then...
This.
And then now,
I don't think I've...
ever felt truly at home until
these last few months
here with you.
I know you love this ship.
You probably love her more
than you love me.
Bill, if you don't
get us off this ship,
you may lose both of us
at the same time.
Why don't you give us a chance?
A closed system lacks
the ability to renew itself.
Knowledge alone is a poor primer.
This has been happening all
over the ship.
Power surges,
temperature fluctuations,
and now you're telling me
it's been him all along?
We had no idea he had this ability.
How's he hooking into the ship?
I thought all our systems
were firewalled.
Well, they are, which is why
he hasn't accessed your computers.
But the organic resins
we've been injecting
into your super structure
contain inductive elements,
not unlike nerve fibers.
So he must have linked to those
and then through them,
the electrical circuitry
embedded in Galactica's bulkheads.
What about our FTLs,
now that we've upgraded with your tech?
Are they vulnerable?
- Theoretically.
- So, theoretically,
he could jump the ship
if he wanted to just like yours did.
End of line. Begin reintegration...
Great. That's all we need.
Take him off line.
Do it.
Begin reintegration
of command subroutines.
There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza,
dear Liza. There's a hole in the bucket.
The long view returns
patterns and repetitions.
All has happened before
and will happen again...
That's a blessed relief.
- Cavil moved the Colony.
- When?
Judging from the residual
energy readings,
about five months ago.
Just before the civil war.
And you have no idea
where he moved it to?
No.
Then excuse me.
Anything you imagine in here
can be as real as you want it to be.
Do you want to see a special room,
a room where I thought
my daughter would live?
Sir.
Can I walk with you, sir?
I'm going to the funeral.
I understand if you're not going.
I'd like your permission, sir,
to take out a Raptor
to go and look for my daughter.
I'm sure Athena
would be willing to pilot and...
I've already sent out
a recon mission
and they reported back.
- You did?
- We were looking for a facility
where we knew
Boomer would probably take Hera,
but it was no longer there.
Sir,
let me take out that Raptor.
- Maybe I can find something.
- She's gone.
I've lost a son,
and you've lost a daughter.
But I can't condone
a suicide mission.
So let it go.
You want me to let it go?
You're the one who can't let go.
Painting over the holes in this bucket?
This ship is dead!
But my daughter
might still be alive.
I understand your pain, Captain,
but don't lecture me.
You're here to take orders.
Do you understand?
I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm sorry.
One... one Raptor, Admiral.
Maybe it is a suicide mission,
but...
at least give me the chance
to do something.
Please?
For those
that we have lost in the past,
and for those
that we are burying today.
- They gave their lives...
- We must remember...
- to save this ship.
- there is a higher purpose.
Casualties,
as much as any soldier fallen...
... we mourn
the passing of our friends.
- Heavenly father...
- We must understand...
- grant us the strength...
- that what we sacrifice today...
- the wisdom...
- our women and men...
- above all, a measure of acceptance...
- of extreme courage.
- however small.
- Because that is what we are,
voyagers traversing the stars
in search of grace.
- So say we all!
- So say we all!
Present arms!
Dismissed.
Listen to me.
The death is not the end.
And I'm not talking
about Cylon resurrection,
I'm talking about the gift
of eternal life
that is offered
to each and every one of us.
Yes,
even the most flawed amongst us.
All we need is the courage
to face death
when it comes calling for us,
embrace it even.
Only then
will we truly have the ability
to cross over,
as one amongst us here has already
crossed over.
One amongst us here
is living proof that there is life
after death.
The blood
on these dog tags
comes from necrotic flesh.
That means a dead body.
The DNA analysis
is 100% proof positive match
for one Captain Kara Thrace.
I told you there were angels
walking amongst you.
When will you believe me?
She took these
from her own mortal remains
that lie on Earth.
- Even now, interred with her bones...
- That's enough!
- Ask her yourself!
- I will put you in the brig!
She's not a Cylon!
They've already been revealed to us!
Ask her yourself!
She will not deny it!
Dismissed, everyone!
Off the deck now!
Kara?
What are you doing?
Okay, listen to me.
I don't care, all right.
I don't...
We've all been through
some crazy, crazy stuff.
I don't care what you think you saw.
I watched your Viper explode.
Don't care.
I'm here. You're here.
This is all that matters.
Okay.
See you around...
Kara Thrace.
- Everything went smoothly, I take it?
- Yes.
It's a shame I can't be there
to see the expression on Ellen's face
when she realizes how we played her.
You had a hard day's work.
Go get some rest.
We'll take it from here.
Don't worry.
We'll take good care of her.
Boomer, no, Boomer!
There, there.
You'll have all sorts
of new playmates pretty soon.
I know you can hear me, Sam,
just like I know on some level
you'll understand.
The old me is dead and gone,
same as the old you.
Just took me a while to accept it.
Which brings us
to the larger question:
why am I here?
I think it has something to do
with this music,
there's a pattern there,
a pattern that I...
can't see,
but I think that you can.
So we are going to sit in this room
until we figure it out.
Talk to me, Sam.
New command.
You wanted to see me?
I've made some decisions.
Good.
About time you sent
those toaster work crews packing,
for all the good they've done.
Actually,
I'm stopping
all the repairs on the ship.
Put out the orders I want the crew
to start stripping down Galactica,
packing all the weapons and gear.
Gonna start offloading the civilians
by tomorrow.
Full crews and ordinances transferred
- by the end of the week.
- What?
We're abandoning ship, Tigh.
No.
No, you can't do this.
I have to, Saul.
She's dying,
and we both know it.
As your XO, I can't let you do this.
I won't.
You've never let me down, Saul.
I can't blame you for...
being what you are,
especially since
it includes being the finest officer
and friend I've ever had.
This ship never let us down,
so we're gonna send her off
in style.
So we're gonna do this?
She was a grand old lady.
The grandest.
To Galactica,
best ship in the fleet.
To Galactica.
<i>Previously on </i>
Battlestar Galactica...
If that's me, then what am I?
She took these
from her own mortal remains.
The blood on these dog tags
is 100% proof positive match
for one Kara Thrace.
We tried hooking him up
to the main power grid.
Thought it might
reset his neural net.
It's happening all over the ship.
Power surges, temperature fluctuations.
And now you're telling me
it's been him all along?
- Is that for me?
- Hera wrote the notes
to a song that my father
used to play to me when I was a child.
The same song that led us to Earth.
There's a pattern that I can't see.
But I think that you can.
So we are going to pick it apart
until we figure it out.
- It's impossible. Somebody saw her.
- What the hell's going on up there?
Boomer took Hera,
just walked right out of the daycare.
Job well done.
Go get some rest.
Don't worry.
We'll take good care of her.
No, Boomer!
If Cavil's plan was to steal Hera
so he could study her,
they'll take her to the colony.
That's where we and the Centurions
went after the first war.
We're abandoning ship, Tigh.
Put out the orders that I want the crew
to start stripping down Galactica,
packing all the weapons and gear.
I want to start offloading the civilians
by tomorrow.
Full crew and ordinances transferred
by the end of the week.
To Galactica,
best ship of the fleet.
To Galactica.
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA
Season 4 - Episode 19
Subtitles
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-
I've commanded two Battlestars
and three escorts before that.
Come on, Bill. Don't be like that.
There's nothing to get all upset about.
Billions of cubits worth
of equipment entrusted to me
not to mention thousands of lives.
It's one hour of your life.
Look, sometimes there are things
you just gotta do, all right?
You always drink and drive?
I drink, he drives.
You like having things done for you,
don't you?
Certainly beats having to do them
for yourself.
Don't you?
No, I prefer not to rely on others
as much as possible.
Less chance
of being let down that way.
Since you allowed yourself
to be in my capable hands
for this evening,
here's hoping I won't let you down.
I'll drink to that, Doctor.
You can...
You can call me Gaius,
actually, if you want.
This is crazy,
but I've actually forgotten your name.
Hello.
Yes, it is.
Hello. How are you?
What?
What?
My Gods. When was this?
Well, listen, just...
I'm so sorry.
If you just wait there,
and I'll be around as soon as I can...
No, please. You have to wait.
You have to...
You can't meet...
You will wait there
or I'll sue you for abandonment.
Yeah, I will.
Well, I don't know how long
it's gonna take. Just wait.
I'm coming.
I'm coming right now.
- Give my love to Sydney!
- I will! Bye bye.
That was a great shower.
Oh, my Gods.
That was amazing.
Just gonna clean up a little bit here.
Laura, no cleaning.
No. This is the last bottle
and you and I have to share it.
You promised me
you would finish all the champagne.
Boy. We drank a lot.
- Well, they did.
- They did.
What about me?
Pregnant girls only get gifts.
- Just a sip.
- A sip?
All right.
- Just one little.
- Little.
Go ahead.
Enough.
My gosh.
That was lovely, Laura. Thank you.
Well, it's the least I can do
for my little sister.
I thought I was your little sister.
Okay,
you are my really little sister.
Oh, boy.
How about that woman
with Mrs. Anderson?
- Why did she bring those?
- Who was she?
I don't know.
But, you know, there's always one.
Frak me. He's early.
Just a second!
Coming!
- Hi, I'm...
- You must be... Lee.
I'm sorry. I'm Kara. Come on in.
That's very nice.
You didn't have to do that.
I'll take those.
Put 'em in some water.
Zak!
Nice place.
It's a rattrap,
but the rent's cheap.
No. It's...
It's got real charm.
And you're a terrible liar.
We should play cards.
- I hold my own.
- I'm sure you do.
You just get uglier every day.
Hey, there he is.
How are you?
I see you've met my better half.
This one's mine. Keep your hands off.
And a girlfriend stealer for a brother.
Nice!
Never stole his girlfriend.
- He's a really bad liar right here.
- No, we figured that out already.
Zak, get the drinks.
- Dinner's almost ready.
- Yes, sir.
I don't know what to say.
It was a mistake.
Nothing in my contract about
being stabbed with a steak knife.
She been stealing
while I've been sleeping.
No one is stealing from you,
dad, all right?
Just shut up.
You're in enough trouble already.
I'm out of here.
You're lucky I don't call the cops.
Yes, we are, nurse Barbara. Thank you.
Now listen. I'll pay you double.
Triple. I thought I asked you
to wait in the car.
This be the new one you be banging?
None of your business.
Nurse, I've got 500 cubits. 1,000.
1,000 frakking cubits for you
to stay the night! Please!
I'll take all the knives away!
He'll be on liquid diet forever.
Just spend one frakking night!
How about you, love?
Bet you charge a lot more than that?
Shut your filthy mouth.
Stop being so disgusting.
- This is your father, Gaius.
- Not that you'd ever know it.
- Gaius is ashamed of his family.
- I need this.
I need this
like a frakking hole in the head.
Stupid bastard
actually changed his accent.
- Would you believe that?
- That is the third nurse in a row.
The third nurse.
Do you have any idea
how much this is costing?
How much it costs.
That's all he cares about now.
Not the way he was brought up,
I can tell ya.
But he don't like to think
about that.
No, he don't like to think
about living on the farm
- and doing a day's hard work.
- All right.
Enough!
Shut up!
Shut up right now!
I won't stand here one moment longer
and listen to your ridiculous
working class hero rant.
Look at you!
Look at your shirt
that I bought you.
How you dribble and treat these things.
I'll break it down for you, dad!
You're an obnoxious, spiteful,
cantankerous old git,
and you're frakking lucky
not living on the frakking street!
Big man cursing his father.
Makes you feel important, does it?
- Gaius, maybe we should...
- Maybe you should've stayed in the car,
which is what I asked you to do.
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave now.
I'm sure that the driver
can see you to your home.
I'm gonna spend the rest
of this lovely evening with my dad.
Good night.
Good morning.
I'm officer Stephanie
and this is officer Shawn
with the Caprica city police.
Are you Laura Roslin?
Yes, I am.
We need to speak with you.
May we come inside?
Yes, please do.
We're so sorry we have to inform you
there's been a terrible accident.
Late last night, your sisters
and your father were all killed.
We weren't able to verify
the identity of the bodies
until a few hours ago.
The driver of the other vehicle
is in stable condition.
And preliminary tests
indicate he was intoxicated
when he sideswiped the car
with your father and your sisters.
Thank you.
Please show yourselves out.
We're sorry for your loss.
I don't know what she's doing.
There's only so much
of Galactica to go around.
You'd think
we're retiring ten Battlestars.
- Excuse me.
- One second.
Tell the captains
they are padding their requests.
- Send it back.
- Sir, if you have a minute.
Just one second.
Specialist, what is it?
I know this is not your problem,
Sir, but
they want us to tear the mag cellerators
from the launch tubes.
Well, the civilian ships
can use them as auto-loaders.
Sir, it's like we're tearing
the old girl's heart out.
A Battlestar's whole purpose
is to launch Vipers.
I kind of know how you feel.
Part of my heart's here too.
Tell you what...
Make the cellerators
the last thing your men take out.
Then turn out the lights
and let the old girl die in peace.
Yes, sir.
Well, after the blast,
everyone else's numbers are down,
which gives us solid majorities on over
half the civilian ships in the fleet.
I mean, no one else comes even close
to having that kind of political power.
Our time is here, Gaius.
She's right, Gaius.
The end times are approaching.
Humanity's final chapter's
about to be written and you...
you will be its author.
Gaius, did you hear me?
This is it.
This is it, Gaius.
Are you...
you thirsty before...
What are you doing here?
How did you get in here?
- Should I...
- What you should do
is go up those stairs, turn left,
go in the bedroom, and get ready.
You are an intruder in my home.
I think it would be a good idea
if you left
before inform the authorities.
If that's the way
you wanna play it, then...
then I'm ringing the police.
Police department, please.
- I found your father a place to live.
- Yes, I'd like to re...
What?
The Regency.
Down by the wharf.
Very tony address.
Full-time care,
social activities, medical staff.
And the best part,
they encourage residents to garden
and grow their own food.
Julius will be a farmer again.
His things are being moved
this very moment by the staff.
They'll be set up
in his new room exactly
how he had them in the apartment.
He loves it.
Loves?
Once I showed him around
the facility.
Your father's a very complicated man,
Gaius, but there's a few
simple things
that make him very happy.
The last time I saw him...
he seemed happy.
Sorry, sir.
As I was saying,
the old man intends to fly
the last Viper off ship himself.
Tell the deck gang
to leave one launch tube intact,
- set to remote pilot launch.
- Yes, sir.
You'll never make Admiral like that.
They're all the same, Karl.
<i>No, they're different.</i>
<i>You know they're different.</i>
How you felt about Boomer,
that was different.
That's why you did what you did.
<i>I did what I did
because I'm a frakkin' idiot.</i>
<i>A 2,000-year-old idiot</i>
<i>who cannot learn
the simplest lesson.</i>
Machines are not people.
They're just machines.
<i>My wife,</i>
<i>Athena,</i>
<i>is a person.</i>
<i>She's a blow-up doll, Karl.
They all are.</i>
<i>Athena, Sharon, Boomer. Call 'em
what you will. They're all the same.</i>
They're all the same
because we made them the same.
<i>Don't blame yourself,
but you can't trust 'em.</i>
<i>You can't trust any of 'em.</i>
Dots.
Lots and lots and lots of dots.
- She's clearly very gifted.
- She hasn't eaten in days.
I think we should begin
intravenous nutritional supplements
to build up her strength
before we begin testing.
She wants her mother.
She can't have her mother now,
can she?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot to sound all soppy and soft
when speaking of the child.
She is a child.
A frightened one.
She's a half human,
half machine object of curiosity
that holds the key
to our continued existence
somewhere in her genetic code.
So let's get a tube
in her and get her ready.
Frak. You didn't hear that,
all right?
Let me help you.
- These are...
- Pilots from the memorial wall.
We wanted to take them with us, so we
wouldn't leave them with the others.
- The others.
- Lotta of photos still down there.
Nobody knows who they are anymore.
Probably friends and relatives
of people on Galactica
who died somewhere along the way.
As you were.
Bear it in mind?
Well, when will you bear it in mind?
You haven't even listened
to my proposal.
I'm not even saying
it was necessarily be me.
My people deserve
a voice in the government.
Now, I'm literally talking
about the lives and well-being
of thousands of people in the fleet.
Is that what you were thinking about
when you outted Starbuck's secret?
The well-being
of thousands of people?
Or the political gain
of Gaius Baltar... again?
Is that what this is about?
Does everything have to be reduced
to your personal feelings
about Kara Thrace?
Listen to me, Mr. Adama.
I'm asking to have
a genuine conversation.
Please.
Five minutes.
I'll be back in five minutes.
Five minutes inside.
And you think there's some kind
of meaning in these musical notes.
I don't know.
I'm just groping mostly.
Looking for patterns.
Trying to see what comes to me.
I thought that if I assigned
numbers to the notes...
I don't know.
What Baltar said the other day,
is it the truth?
Yeah.
I found my body
and I burned it on Earth.
I don't know what I am.
I have to ask him a question.
Do you know how to plug him in?
Yeah.
I know what you are.
You're my daughter.
Don't forget it.
You're on pace to land
in the hall of fame some day.
But you still haven't won
a championship
and now the C-Bucs
are in a rebuilding year.
If you don't get to hoist
the cup before you retire,
will you consider
your career to be incomplete?
Well, right now, I'm just...
focused on getting stronger
and helping out the team
any way I can.
Look, you want to know the truth?
I don't really care
about the stats or the cup
or the trophy or anything like that.
In fact, even the games
aren't that important to me.
Not really.
What matters to me is...
the perfect throw, okay?
Making the perfect catch.
The perfect step and block.
It's perfection.
That's what it's about.
It's about those moments when you...
When you can feel
the perfection of creation.
The... the beauty of physics.
The wonder of mathematics.
You know, the... the elation
of action and reaction.
And that is the kind of perfection
that I wanna be connected to.
Spins and turns.
Angles and curves.
The shape of dreams half-remembered.
Slip the surly bonds of Earth
and touch the face of perfection.
A perfect face.
Perfect lace.
Find a perfect world
for the end of Kara Thrace.
End of line.
He says a lot of things.
Go ahead.
Ask your question.
You ask him.
Let's forget
you're the son of the admiral.
Shut the frak up.
Get to the frakkin' point.
You got five minutes. Speak.
Galactica has been more
than our guardian.
She's literally a vessel into which we
have poured all of our hopes and dreams.
And when she's gone,
when we can no longer
derive the security
from looking out a window
and seeing her massive bulk gliding by,
then this life will be over
and a new life will have begun.
A new life
that requires a new way of thinking.
Now, I am willing to do anything...
anything I can
to make this new life a good one.
All I am asking is that my people
have a voice in the government.
I represent thousands of people.
They deserve to be enfranchised
just as much as anyone else.
I'm not talking about myself.
This is not for me personally.
Come on, Lee.
It makes sense.
You know it's the right thing to do.
What I know...
Is that in all the years
that I've known you, I've never seen you
- make one truly selfless act.
- Right.
Never seen you do something
that didn't on some level
serve the greater needs
of Gaius frakking Baltar.
So, no, I won't take your hand.
And I won't bring you
or any representative
from your movement into the government.
Right. So that's
what it boils down to.
My people can't get representation
because I personally haven't passed
Lee Adama's selfless altruism test.
I haven't been a goody-goody
and won a badge of honor.
I don't think you've passed
Gaius Baltar's test.
Go ahead, look me in the eye
and tell me about the time
that you made a truly
heroic act of conscience
which helped you
not even in the slightest.
Tell me!
I'll even believe you.
You're right.
I wouldn't trust me either.
Holy frak.
I dare you.
I double-dog dare you.
Get out of here!
Come on!
Come on!
Attaboy!
Frak.
Stupid frakkin' bird.
Can I have your attention, please?
I'm sure you're all aware that a child
was abducted from this ship recently.
I thought that a rescue mission
was impractical.
Well, I was wrong.
He didn't say
where he got the information but
Starbuck was there,
so I bet he talked to Anders.
Yeah. I know.
Pretty freaky.
He thought
a rescue mission was impractical
because he didn't know
where she was being held.
But that's changed now, I guess,
because he does know
where she's being held.
Knowing where the colony is
is not nearly the same thing
as being able to actually get her out.
This is insane.
You know that, right?
Hera has some meaning
that transcends the here and now.
She's meant to fulfill a role
just as we were.
So we're going... the five of us.
You're making decisions
for all of us now.
You'll go, Tory.
Truth is, you never could be alone.
Yeah, the mission is to be
strictly volunteer only.
Any man or woman over the age of 15.
And the Admiral also wants
any former colonial officer or crewmen
incarcerated
after the recent mutiny.
Yeah. That's it.
Everyone has to make their own choice
and they have to do it in person.
The old man is waiting
on the hangar deck.
Set in-port watch
until you get back.
Watch keepers
report to the Admiral's quarters
to declare yourselves in person.
Move.
- You know what you're gonna do?
- Not exactly.
Well, take your time.
Takes approximately four minutes
to get down there.
It's really happening.
We're going after her.
Or what's left of her.
Cavil's probably had her
sliced and diced
- and cut up into a thousand specimens.
- Stop it.
Just stop it.
She's still alive.
And she's till out there.
And we're gonna get her.
And everything's gonna be all right.
It's not gonna be all right, Karl.
You're wrong.
You're wrong.
I know it's been three months.
I know that.
I do too go out.
I do.
I do.
No, I'm not joining
Adar's presidential campaign.
I don't care.
Because I don't like politics
to begin with
and a national campaign
is just so...
Gods,
you are relentless.
I'll make you a deal.
I'll go on the date
if you'll stop bugging me
about this campaign.
How young is he?
I know.
I made a deal.
What's Mr. Perfect's name?
Sean. I like that name.
Sean what?
Sean Allison?
Sounds familiar.
All right.
Bye.
No one should feel obligated
to join this mission
in any way!
This is a decision
I have made for myself.
If it turns out
that there are not enough personnel
to crew Galactica...
I will lead a Raptor assault
with anyone
who is willing to join me.
Let there be no illusions!
This is likely to be
a one-way trip.
So don't volunteer out of sentiment
or emotion.
There is a line running down
this deck.
Volunteers,
move to the starboard side!
Everyone else,
to the port.
Make your choice.
Doc.
The fleet can't afford
to lose a Doctor.
Go on back, Sherman.
And thank you.
Like you got something better to do.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
You didn't think
you were gonna take off without me,
Admiral, did you?
Never crossed my mind,
Madam President.
Jump complete.
Frak!
- Plot us a way back out of here.
- Right. You got it.
<i>Figures that a brain damaged Cylon
would send us in an asteroid field.</i>
The more things change,
the more they stay the same.
You got a recon mission
where someone needs
to hang their ass over the edge
and wait for a bite,
- send Racetrack and Skulls.
- Well, beats sittin' in a cell.
Long range dradis
just picked something up.
Holy frak,
we're right on top of a singularity.
A black hole? Where away?
738 carom 882.
We're already sliding toward it.
Spin up the FTL.
We're getting out of here.
Frak me.
- What?
- You're not gonna believe this.
Based on the coordinates
we got from Sam,
we've determined
that the Cylon Colony is located here.
It's within our jump range,
but there's a sizable catch.
It's located within an accretion disk
of a naked singularity.
It's a strategically sound position.
The Colony's bound within
the gravity well of the black hole,
- but maintains a stable orbit.
- How do we get in there?
Look at all the crap
floating around in that current.
There's no way to navigate that current.
The tidal stresses are too strong.
It would rip the ship apart
before we got within ten SU.
There is one safe jump spot. It's where
they bring their baseships in and out.
We got lucky.
Two baseships jumped in and out
while the Raptor
was taking pictures.
This right here is our only
parking spot.
That's right on top
of the frakking thing.
- Less than one click by our estimates.
- One click?
Point blank range.
And you can bet that
they will have every gun in that colony
pointed at that parking spot
of yours.
That's what I'd do.
Leave only one way in and out
then make it impossible
to get past the gates.
All right.
Let's get to work.
Thank you for watching Galactica
with our subtitles
<i>Previously on</i> Battlestar Galactica
- You must be... Lee.
- Hi, I'm...
A girlfriend stealer for a brother.
- Nice.
- Never stole his girlfriend.
He's a really bad liar right here.
There's been a terrible accident.
Your sisters and your father
were all killed.
How about you, love?
- Bet you charge a lot more than that?
- Shut your filthy mouth.
Stop being so disgusting.
This is your father, Gaius.
I found your father
a new place to live.
The last time I saw him,
he seemed happy.
Bill, I've been having
that dream again.
If that's me lying there,
then what am I?
She took these
from her own mortal remains.
The blood on these dog tags
is 100% proof positive match
for one Kara Thrace.
And you think there's some kind
of meaning in these musical notes.
I'm just groping mostly.
Looking for patterns,
trying to see what comes to me.
She's a half-human, half-machine
object of curiosity
that holds the key
to our continued existence
somewhere in her genetic code.
So let's get a tube in her
and get her ready.
Based on the coordinates
we got from Sam,
we have determined
that the Cylon colony is located here.
The colony's bound within
the gravity well of the black hole,
but maintains a stable orbit.
This right here
is our only parking spot.
Point blank range.
Leave only one way in and out,
then make it impossible
to get past the gates.
Let's get to work.
Can I have your attention, please?
I'm going to be asking for volunteers
in the rescue of the child Hera.
There is a line
running down this deck.
Volunteers,
move to the starboard side.
Everyone else, to the port.
40? I never paid
more than 30 on Picon!
This ain't Picon.
Right, you got me there.
"This ain't Picon." All right. 40.
Show him a good time!
I don't want a lap dance, okay?
Try it! You'll like it!
Keep the 40.
He deserves it. Thank you.
- Are you gonna take the job or not?
- Maybe I should just do it.
I'm letting my pride get in the way.
Now you're talkin'.
I mean, who cares?
It's one hour of your time,
and then you have a whole new life!
A life without midnight watches,
or drills,
or fleet politics,
or the inspections,
or any of that crap.
Life!
You could be here every night!
He won't be here every night.
Can hardly get him here once.
To retirement?
What do you say?
To retirement.
If you don't participate in politics,
then you are giving up your voice.
You're giving up your right
to have a say in the way
that our society is run.
- What?
- You've really bought into that crap?
I do. Proudly.
- And so do you, by the way.
- Really?
That's what the uniform stands for.
It's what we train to defend.
- Oh, you didn't.
- It's true!
That's sad. That's sad.
It's cute, but it's sad.
Lemme guess.
He's going on about voting
and it's importance
to a democratic way of life again.
So, you were listening.
You didn't tell me that your brother
was an idealistic dreamer.
- Dreamer.
- It's sad. Truth is, he's not.
Beneath that romantic exterior
lies the heart of a true cynic.
- Things are looking up.
- This is gonna be fascinating.
Yeah, it's one of the many,
many, many reasons
that him and dad
aren't on speaking terms anymore.
- Come on.
- Family angst syndrome,
I love it. Come on, boys.
- Let's open up some old wounds.
- No, let's not.
Dad believes in the system.
Believes in the uniform.
Believes in something
greater than himself.
Correction, dad believes in himself.
His uniform, his system,
his way of life.
And if you're not with him
in that tiny, little bubble,
- then you might as well not exist.
- If you hate him so much,
why'd you follow in his footsteps?
<i>Touché.</i>
Service gave me four years of college.
I gave the service four years in return.
- Simple as that.
- See?
A cynic.
Right through to that big, empty space
that used to hold his heart.
Honey, I think
I'm starting to like your brother.
You must be Sean.
Yeah, I must be.
I hope so.
- I'll take these. They're beautiful.
- You're welcome.
Do you like white wine?
I do.
Kinda awkward?
- Blind date and all?
- No, it's not, really.
It's just that I have this feeling.
- That I know you.
- Oh?
Really?
There you go, Sean.
- Thank you.
- Welcome.
Wait a minute.
You were one of my students.
Yeah, guilty as charged.
I mean, as soon as Marcie
mentioned your name I knew,
but I didn't wanna tell her.
- You knew I was old enough to be...
- My teacher? Yeah.
But I graduated.
Some time ago.
- Should I go?
- Did I say you should go?
I didn't say that.
The night's young.
Apparently so are you.
Let's see what happens.
Sean Allison.
You wouldn't do it.
For that kind of money?
You're Gods damn right I would.
No, you wouldn't.
Look me in the eye
and tell me that you'd do it.
That you'd do it
for a civilian desk job.
I wanna hear it
come outta your mouth.
Say it!
I frakkin' knew it.
Come on, soldier.
I love you guys.
Because you guys are my family.
My Gods. My Gods. Come on.
- I love you, brother.
- Come on, big boy.
- Legs.
- All right.
In you go.
- You want out?
- Yes, please.
Thank you.
- He never could hold his liquor.
- Unlike his brother.
I'm still standing.
Which means...
It's time for shots.
There's no need
to torture yourself, Gaius.
Just trust in God's plan for you.
What is God's plan for me?
Well, you're following it right now.
Am I?
By taking charge
of mankind's remnants,
and guiding them to their end.
End of what?
Gaius.
- We're ready to go.
- Five seconds, Paulla.
I'm just...
I'm leaving Ishay enough
for two more rounds of injections.
That should keep you on your feet
for another 48 hours.
Two days. Okay.
That's... Should be enough.
You're using up the last little bit
of life you got. You realize that?
Yes.
You've made that clear to me
several times.
Right. That's it.
- We're done.
- Thank you.
And...
Thank you, Doctor.
I'm just doing my job.
No.
You've done much more than that.
You've taken a...
patient who should've died
years ago, and you've...
given her a chance despite cancer,
and the Cylons,
and her own obstinate nature.
And you've...
You've given me
the little time I have left,
and for that you...
You have my...
my heartfelt
gratitude and my thanks.
Well, I...
I don't know what to say.
Don't.
Don't spoil your image, just
light a cigarette and go and grumble.
It's your patient now, Ishay.
Ishay, I...
- I can barely see straight.
- I'm not surprised.
You're so pumped full of drugs
you could float off this bed.
Okay.
Two days?
All right, two days.
The plan's just starting to take shape,
but one thing's clear.
Raptors get the toughest job,
as usual.
This will require
some special piloting skills,
and I mean special.
Threading a needle
while you're on a rollercoaster special.
It seems a little redundant,
the word's come down
that it's a volunteer assignment so...
That's my Raptor wranglers.
Always looking for new
and interesting ways to get killed.
I'm not gonna lie to you, boys,
we are thin on intel on this one.
The Cylons believe
that the most logical place for Cavil
to have taken the girl
is deep into the interior of the Colony.
Best guess.
Right here.
We'll be in too close for nukes.
Same thing goes for missiles.
Now this gonna be strictly
a gun battle.
Like two old ships on the line,
slugging it out at point-blank range.
I want the gun captains to do their job
and start firing immediately.
And to continue to fire
until they run outta ammo.
Then...
I want them to start throwing rocks.
They're gonna have every gun trained
directly on us as soon as we jump in.
If we have any shot at this,
we're gonna have to interrupt
their fire control systems.
And just how the hell is Sam
supposed to help with that?
If we can plug him into Galactica's
dradis, FTL, and C-3 systems,
his mind should then be able
to directly communicate
with the colony's hybrids
once we jump in.
Theoretically, his mind should still
be able to control their commands
and slow down their response time.
Okay.
- Let's do it, I guess.
- There's a catch.
Routing hardware connections
from all systems
into this room is gonna take weeks.
It's a lot easier, faster,
if we move him to the existing lines.
- Okay, where's that?
- Well, best place is the CIC.
I need someone to lead this fleet
who I trust,
and demands universal respect.
So the baseship
and the fleet are yours.
Thank you, sir.
I won't let you down.
I know you won't.
I'll see you at the rendezvous.
If we're not there in 12 hours,
we won't be comin'.
Yes, sir.
Good hunting, sir.
Thank you, Admiral Hoshi.
Still not too late
to flush them all out the airlock.
Take too much time.
I suppose this is what you could
call poetic justice.
Or what goes around comes around.
Either way,
congratulations, Mr. President.
Thank you, Mr. Adama.
And the best of luck.
Admiral Hoshi, sir.
Sir.
- The "sir" is...
- Right. Good luck.
You too, sir.
President of the colonies,
Admiral of the fleet, departing.
All right, last Raptor out, people!
Last Raptor out!
Anyone left behind,
your ass belongs to us!
Great.
Can we tuck this in there?
Listen, I'm not coming with you.
- No, please.
- I made up my mind.
- Our people need you.
- I don't belong to you, Paulla.
I never belonged to you.
You appropriated me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry if I led you to believe...
They're all yours, Paulla, enjoy them.
Pilot, you have your passengers.
- Gaius, don't do this.
- Maybe I'll see you in the next life.
Doctor.
<i>Galactica, baseship actual.</i>
<i>The flag's been transferred
to the baseship,</i>
<i>our vipers are ready
to take over CAP duties for the fleet.</i>
Roger that, baseship,
you have the CAP.
- Safe journey.
<i>- Godspeed, Galactica.</i>
Let's go around the horn.
This is the XO.
All combat stations
prepare to report.
<i>- FTL.</i>
- Go.
We'll set up triage here.
Just prep the table the way that I do.
<i>Weapons.</i>
<i>Go.</i>
Separate out the wounded.
Those we can save,
and those we can't.
- <i>Engineering.
- Go.</i>
How will I know?
Take this marker.
Put an X on the forehead
of those who are too badly hurt.
You'll know when you see them.
<i>Main battery.</i>
<i>Go.</i>
- <i>Engine room.
- Go.</i>
We're next.
<i>Sick bay.</i>
<i>Sick bay's a go.</i>
- <i>Viper wing.</i>
- Go.
<i>Assault one.</i>
<i>Assault two.</i>
<i>Reserve force.</i>
<i>Com 1.</i>
- Sorry.
- Caprica.
<i>Com 2.</i>
What're you doing here?
What...
I don't think you should be here.
Probably been in more battles
than you've have.
Fair point.
<i>Life support.</i>
<i>Emergency system standing by.</i>
I suppose a more pertinent question is
what am I doing here?
What the hell was I thinking?
<i>Secure blast doors on all decks.</i>
Ellen.
I think we're a go up here.
All stations report, sir.
Connect me just to the ship.
This is the Admiral.
Just so there'll be
no misunderstandings later...
Galactica's seen a lot of history.
<i>Gone through a lot of battles.</i>
<i>This will be her last.</i>
<i>She will not fail us</i>
<i>if we do not fail her.</i>
<i>If we succeed in our mission,
Galactica will bring us home.</i>
<i>If we don't...</i>
<i>It doesn't matter anyway.</i>
Action, stations.
- Start the clock.
- Start the clock.
Jump on my mark.
Five, four,
three,
two, one,
mark.
We can't take much of this.
It's time, Sam.
Look through the eye
just with thyself.
The Colony hybrids are offline.
They'll be launching raiders any minute.
Launch all wings.
Birds are away.
All ahead, flank speed!
Three, two, one, hit it!
<i>All hands brace for impact.</i>
<i>Assault one, stand by.</i>
Here they come, let's take 'em!
Light it up.
Assault team on me.
Let's do this. Go. Get out there.
Pressure.
- We've got pressure, sir.
- One atmosphere.
Assault one, we got pressure.
Alpha team, helmets off.
Move out.
Think we lost Cartwheel.
- Dradis is almost useless out here.
- I hope that works both ways.
Any sign they spotted our approach?
I haven't looked at the instruments.
I don't think you want me to start now.
Maybe not.
Let's go weapons hot, Skulls.
We're gettin' close.
- Sure about that?
- No.
But I don't wanna come outta this crap
with cold weapons, either.
Nukes are hot.
You know, this reminds me
of that time back during landing qual.
Battery three, redirect your fire!
Ten degrees starboard!
Concentrate on taking out
the Cylon batteries!
Hotdog, Ladykiller,
<i>concentrate
on taking out Cylon raiders</i>
coming in at 084 carom 229.
Tally, Galactica. We got 'em.
<i>We have a hard seal. Go.</i>
You're gonna just
keep doing the tests.
Even with the Colony
coming down around your ears?
I think you overestimate
their chances.
They may have confused
our hybrids temporarily,
but we have superior fire power
and superior numbers.
And in the end
it's all about mathematics.
Listen to me.
You're pushing too much energy
through the ACS. You gotta back off.
You're gonna blow the main bus.
You hear me?
Sam!
There are secrets within the eyes,
answers within riddles.
Lay off the ACS?
You betcha, Galen.
Hear what your heart wants to deny.
End of line.
You never should've trusted her.
Trust didn't enter into it.
I simply miscalculated her need
to engage in gestures of futility.
We have to assume
that she'll try to make contact
with the colonial forces
aboard the Colony.
- It's time to go on the offensive.
- We must be cautious.
Too much force
could risk killing the child.
Really? Ya think?
Please continue stating
the perfectly obvious.
It fills me with confidence.
I'm proud of you.
What?
For doing this.
For being here
when you coulda just walked away.
I don't think
I ever said it before, but...
I always wanted to be proud of you.
Guess I always felt
that was the only thing missing.
All the pieces
are falling into place.
You will hold the future
of Cylons and humans in your hands.
I will?
You see them?
Reconnect me!
Cylons just blew a hole
into deck 21!
Frakkin' Centurions'll be pouring in
at platoon strength!
On me, let's move!
Wait.
Tell the Old Man...
I owed him one.
Doesn't change
anything you did, though.
We all make our choices.
Today I made a choice.
I think it's my last one.
It's really touching.
Can we get the hell outta here?
You should know
your Raptor's been destroyed.
You can't go back that way.
- Well, that's not the plan.
- Can we not tell her the plan?
Right.
Missed the trap seven times
in two days.
It's a new galactic record.
Regs say
that you've washed out, rook.
- Time to look for a new career.
- What do you want me to do, sir?
Do you want me to beg for my billet?
Do you want me to crawl?
I want you to land your frakkin' bird
without diggin' holes into my deck.
How's that?
How about being a pilot?
An officer worthy of the uniform.
Take your job seriously.
Don't let your personal life
get in the way.
I've read your jacket.
Your whole story.
I know that your family's gone,
and I know that you have no home.
All you got is the service.
And it's slowly slippin' away.
All because...
you're wrapped up
in survivor's guilt.
You're trying to find
a way to wash yourself out.
The Doctor's in.
Check your neuroses at the door.
Lotta people have died on this ship.
There's a lotta ghosts
running around here.
You don't wanna pull them
into your cockpit with you.
Because you won't come back alive.
Do you understand that?
Yes, sir.
I don't think you do, but...
maybe someday you will.
As for now...
make the trap tomorrow, rook.
Dismissed.
Thank you, sir.
I owe you one.
A lot of other people owe me one,
but you know what,
very few people ever pay back.
Especially the ones
that owe you their lives.
I'll pay you back one day, sir.
When it really means something.
You do that.
Okay, get this guy cross-checked
and set me up a large-bore IV.
I need a set of wipers on this marine,
and a CT scan over here on this one.
And get him the frak out of here!
It's all right.
You've gonna be all right.
He's gone.
All right, you'll be...
You're gonna be all right.
- What took you so long?
- Stopped for coffee.
How many other Raptor teams made it?
Haven't seen anybody else.
Okay, back the way we came.
Guns. Point.
Yes, sir.
We're retracing our steps.
Say again, Apollo!
I cannot copy
your last transmission!
This is the XO.
Red stripes to repel boarders.
Deck 21, portside, frame 10.
<i>We got the prize!
Repeat, we have the prize!</i>
<i>Formed up with assault 2
and are heading back to base.</i>
Roger that!
ETA five minutes.
Actual out.
Fire!
We got a fire up here!
- Connect me to command unit!
- Yes, sir!
Move reserved forces
to guard airlock.
Assault force is en route.
ETA five minutes.
I repeat, ETA five minutes.
We're friendly!
Hold your fire!
Friendlies!
Rangel, Peters, form up!
- Sorry 'bout that.
- Doc, you did good.
- Thank you.
- We'll take Hera.
Right.
- Come on.
- Come on, bring Hera.
Get him outta here.
Fall back, fall back!
What?
Hera.
Clear!
Oh, God!
Check this out.
Keep that *** back here!
Hang on.
- Hera!
- Hera, come back here!
- Hera!
- Look at me!
- Go.
- No, you'll bleed out.
Go!
Go!
I'm empty.
Two rounds.
I've been here before.
Yes.
- We're... we're supposed to...
- Go into the opera house.
- This one's still alive!
- Get him the hell outta here!
They got the girl.
They've got the little girl!
This makes it a lot easier.
I just take the little girl
and I'm outta here.
Not a chance.
Cavil, we won't let you take Hera.
You know that.
I know nothing of the kind.
I know I'm gonna watch you
chase your tails across the universe
- for another four years.
- That's not gonna happen.
This thing is the key to my people's
survival and I'm not leaving without it.
Hera's not a thing.
She's a child.
And she holds the key
to humanity's survival as well.
And how do you know that?
I see angels.
Angels in this very room.
Now I may be mad.
But that doesn't mean
that I'm not right.
Because there's another force
at work here.
There always has been.
It's undeniable.
We've all experienced it.
Everyone in this room has witnessed
events that they can't fathom,
let alone explain away
by rational means.
Puzzles deciphered in prophecy.
Dreams given to a chosen few.
Our loved ones dead.
Risen.
Whether we wanna call
that "God" or "Gods",
or some sublime inspiration
or a divine force
that we can't know or understand,
it doesn't matter... It doesn't matter.
It's here.
It exists.
And our two destinies
are entwined in its force.
If that were true...
and that's a big "if"...
how do I know this force
has our best interests in mind?
How do you know
that God is on your side, Doctor?
I don't.
God's not on any one side.
God's a force of nature...
beyond good and evil.
Good and evil, we created those.
And we'll break the cycle.
Break the cycle of birth,
death, rebirth,
destruction, escape, death.
Well, that's in our hands...
and our hands only.
Requires a leap of faith.
Requires that we live in hope...
not fear.
If I leave you this girl,
that means
the destruction of my people.
How does our extinction fit into this
picture that you want us to believe in?
We'll give you resurrection.
Saul!
You give us Hera
and we will give you resurrection.
But the war ends here.
You leave humanity in peace...
and give up the pursuit now
and for all time.
Agreed.
How do we know
we can take your word for it?
You don't.
You have to make a leap of faith.
It's your call, Bill.
I'll back you either way.
I'm losing a lot of men out there.
I can do something
about that right now.
- Give me that phone.
- Patch him through.
Hello, it's me, Cavil.
Stand down!
All forces cease fire immediately.
Galactica, Hotdog.
<i>They're pulling back.</i>
<i>Repeat.
They're pulling back!</i>
Everyone... stand down.
I'm as good as my word.
Admiral...
Viper wing's aboard.
We lost four birds.
Assault force is aboard.
We've lost seven Raptors.
What are they doing?
Each of them knows
part of the secret to resurrection.
They're gonna interact
with the dataflow in the water.
And... I don't know.
It's a lotta complicated
technical talk
about sharing the information
among the five of them
and then transferring it
over to the Colony somehow.
Now, for a moment,
we're going to know everything
there is to know about one another.
Looking forward to that.
There are certain things that...
That we've all done.
Certain things that...
people would be shocked
to learn about.
Hey, I don't mean to rush you, but you
are keeping two civilizations waiting!
Let's...
let's just all agree that no matter...
what we learn about each other,
we're all Cylons, and we're
all capable of making mistakes.
You're forgiven
for all your dark secrets.
Let's do this.
Any word?
We're getting the data now.
It looks right.
They're downloading
the resurrection designs now.
- They've broken off the download.
- It's a trick! Open fire!
Frak!
We've gotta get outta here!
Starbuck, jump the ship!
I don't have
the rendezvous coordinates!
Doesn't matter!
Just jump us out of here now!
Jump!
Just trust yourself.
There must be some kind
of way out of here.
I thought that if I assign
numbers to the notes...
If that's me lying there,
then what am I?
When I look at you now,
I don't see Kara Thrace. I see...
an angel blazing
with the light of God.
Angel.
Jump!
You're tempting fate.
If I have a fate, then it is set
and thinking about it
isn't gonna make it happen any faster.
Fair enough. But flying...
when you're thinking
about dying and...
It's a bad way of doing business.
You're gonna get scared and you're
gonna start second guessing yourself.
I'm not scared.
You said that you think about...
dying every time
that you get into a cockpit.
Well, hello?
Yeah, but it doesn't scare me.
Like, that's what you don't get.
What, so it's...
Kara Thrace, the fearless warrior,
right?
No, I know... I know fear.
And I get scared. Just...
Just not of dying.
So then what does scare you?
Sorry.
Being forgotten.
- You all right?
- I am fine.
- XO?
- Sir?
Sitrep.
Damage report.
I'm okay.
I'm okay, go.
Sir.
We're mostly here.
The engines... life support...
But there's red lines
through her lateral
structural members.
She's broke her back.
She'll never jump again.
Wherever we are
is where we're gonna stay.
Where have you taken us, Kara?
Glad you could join us, Admiral.
Lieutenant Hoshi suits
me just fine, sir.
Admiral stars turned out
to be a little heavy.
Happiest day of my life when I saw that
Raptor jump into the rendezvous point.
Well, there you have it, Admiral.
The most advanced civilization
we could locate on this planet.
I can't see them
talking to each other.
So either they communicate
a different way or they're pre-verbal.
Judging by the look of their tools,
which are rudimentary to say the least,
I'd suggest that we've found
an early, ritualistic, tribal society.
They bury their dead.
I came across a grave a couple
of clicks back and ran some tests.
Their DNA is compatible with ours.
Meaning we can breed with them.
You got a one-track mind, Doc.
What?
Listen, I'm talking about the survival
of the human race, actually.
Not some get together
with the natives.
You also have no sense of humor.
Right.
Right, I'm sorry.
How's that possible?
Human beings naturally evolved
on a planet
one million light years away.
- The odds against that are...
- Astronomical, yeah.
One might even say
there was a divine hand at work.
Well,
whoever's responsible, we're here.
And here's where we're gonna stay...
With our new families.
My vote is that we clear
everything back to this ridge.
Easy access to the water
down by the river.
In fact, the whole area's
ripe for cultivation.
We should have the preliminary lines
for a city within a day or two.
No.
No city.
Not this time.
What do you propose we do?
We break the cycle.
We leave it all behind
and start over.
You're talking about
a little over 38,000 people...
The entire human race...
With nothing but the clothes
on their backs and some provisions.
It's not the entire human race.
- There are people already here.
- Tribal.
Without language even.
But we can give them that.
I mean, we can give them the...
The best part of ourselves.
But not the baggage.
Not the ships, the equipment,
the technology, the weapons.
If there's one thing
that we should've learned, it's that...
you know, our brains
have always outraced our hearts.
Our science charges ahead.
Our souls lag behind.
Let's start a new.
We'll land civilians
at various points
around the planet.
Our objective will be to spread
the people out as much as possible
to give them
the best possibility of survival.
Supplies will be evenly
distributed throughout the camps.
And locations will be documented
and given to everyone.
I have to say, I'm shocked
at how amenable
everyone is to this notion.
I would have thought there'd be
general uprising at the idea of losing
whatever little creature comforts
we had left.
Don't underestimate the desire
for a clean slate, Mr. Lampkin.
Have you made a decision?
The Sixes, the Eights and the Twos
have decided to stay.
See how we can contribute to the world
before we pass into God's hands.
We'll give the baseship
to the Centurions,
let them find their own destiny.
I think they've earned
their freedom.
And what if they evolve again
on their own
and decide to come back
in a few hundred years and wipe us out?
It's a risk.
But I think setting them free may be
enough to break the cycle of violence.
And it's a risk worth taking.
And I agree.
They've earned it.
Now once the civilians
have been off-loaded,
the fleet will leave the orbit
and rendezvous with Galactica.
The course of the fleet will be plotted
into the nav computer ahead of time.
But the actual piloting
will be done by Mr. Anders.
He'll guide the entire fleet
directly into the sun.
I love you.
Good-bye... Sam.
I'll see you on the other side.
Is your name William Adama?
Yes.
Are you an officer
in the Colonial fleet?
Yes.
Are you a Cylon?
I'm sorry, Bill. We're still
establishing tests for the control.
I need verifiable yeses and nos.
No. I'm not a Cylon.
Have you ever stolen money
from a cash drawer?
- Have you ever stolen money...
- Enough of this crap.
Take this thing off me right now.
No job is worth this,
no matter how fat the paycheck is.
I'd rather spend the rest of my career,
what's left of it,
on a broken down old ship
than have someone sit here
and question my word.
Perfection.
That's what it's about.
It's those moments...
when you can feel
the perfection of creation.
The beauty of physics, you know?
The wonder of mathematics.
The elation of action
and reaction.
And that is the kind of perfection
that I wanna be connected to.
You sure this is what you want,
Galen?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Just tired of people.
Human, Cylons, whatever.
Last Raptor is gonna drop me off
on this island that I found off
one of the northern continents.
It's cold.
It's up in the highlands.
There's no people.
Good luck.
For what it's worth,
if what happened
to Cally had happened to Ellen,
I'd have done the same frakking thing.
I thought Bill was coming.
- He's taking a leak.
- Oh, nice.
Order me a drink, honey.
Keep 'em coming.
Tonight we are celebrating
your retirement
and all the time I'm about to get
to spend with my husband.
Are you good with that?
All I've ever wanted
was to be with you.
Not just weekend liberties
or two week's leave a year.
I mean full-time.
You and me.
Together in a house, in a tent.
Homeless and on the street.
Just be together.
Excuse me.
Don't drop me!
To us!
They're so many.
Wait!
I wanna...
see more detail.
It's...
a very beautiful world.
Does it have a name?
Earth.
It's not Earth.
Earth is a dream.
One we've been chasing
for a long time.
We've earned it. This is Earth.
Okay then.
Earth.
It's fine.
I'm having trouble...
breathing.
Would you like to get
a better look at them?
Yes, I'd...
love it.
I would.
- Watch.
- What?
- Why? What are you doing?
- Watch me.
- What are you doing?
- Put your arm around me. Can you?
Dad?
I don't have much time, son.
I understand.
What do you hear, Starbuck?
Nothing but the rain.
Grab your gun and bring in the cat.
You should go.
You know,
my very earliest memory of my father
was him flying away on a big plane.
And wondering
when he was coming back.
He's not coming back this time.
No,
he's not.
Neither am I.
Where are you going?
I don't know.
I just know that I'm done here.
I've completed my journey
and it feels good.
You and I...
Right here...
Right now.
On the table?
I dare you.
I double-dog dare you.
- Double-dog dare?
- Oh, yeah. Double-dog.
All right.
Something's broken.
I guess I better... get going.
It was nice to meet you...
Lee Adama.
Likewise, Kara Thrace.
So what about you?
What are you gonna do?
Today
is the first day
of the rest of your life, Lee.
Well...
I always thought
when this was all done I would...
kick back.
Relax.
Spend the rest of my days doing
the absolute minimum humanly possible.
And now that you're here?
I want to explore!
I wanna climb the mountains.
I wanna cross the oceans.
I wanna...
I can't believe I'm saying this.
It sounds so exhausting.
I must be crazy.
Good-bye, Kara.
You won't be forgotten.
You okay?
Sean, it's been a lovely evening.
Really lovely.
But I'm afraid
we won't be doing this again.
- Did I...
- No.
No, not you.
No, you're wonderful.
- Come on then...
- No.
You can show yourself out.
I'm sorry.
Hello, this is Laura Roslin.
I'd like you to give a message to...
Mayor Adar.
Tell him that I will...
be joining his campaign.
Thank you.
All the way to the end.
No matter what.
All the way to the end.
So much...
life.
It's a rich continent.
More wildlife
than all the 12 Colonies put together.
Just looking for a quiet little place
for that cabin.
Maybe a garden.
I don't have much of a green thumb,
so I hope that you do.
Right there.
I'm gonna build it right there,
Laura.
Lot of game on this planet.
- I'm a pretty good hunter, you know?
- Yeah, right.
What are you laughing at?
What?
That buck on Caprica.
Okay, come on now.
That's not fair.
Don't you listen to mommy.
Daddy is a great hunter.
No, mommy's gonna teach you
how to hunt.
Real hunting.
And I'm gonna teach you
how to build a house
and how to plant crops.
Okay, maybe mommy will teach you that,
but daddy's gonna teach you how to hunt.
Hera...
will she be all right?
She survived.
- Thanks to you.
- Both of you.
And that's it?
That's all God wants of us?
God's plan is never complete.
- Great.
- But I think it's safe to say...
that from now on
your lives will be less...
eventful.
I've been thinking.
I may be able
to help you out after all.
About that thing
you were asking about before.
Getting a peek
into the defense mainframe.
- It would mean a lot to my employers.
- I'm not doing it for employers.
I'm doing it for you.
How would it make you feel?
I'd be very grateful.
We'll put that to the test.
Because if anyone finds out,
I could get my head cut off.
So I'll count on your discretion.
The things men do for love.
Love?
Yeah, well. You know...
You know what I mean, don't you?
Over there between those two peaks.
I saw some terrain
that looked good for cultivation.
Cultivation?
Yes.
You know, I know about farming.
I know.
I know you do.
I laid out the cabin today.
It's gonna have an easterly view.
You should see the light
that we get here.
When the sun comes
from behind those mountains...
It's almost heavenly.
It reminds me of you.
"At a scientific conference this week
at the Smithsonian in Washington,
"the startling announcement was made
that archeologists believe
"they have found fossilized remains
of a young woman
"who may actually be
Mitochondrial Eve.
"Mitochondrial Eve is the name
scientists have given
"to the most recent common ancestor
for human beings now living on Earth.
"She lived in what is now Tanzania,
"over 150,000 years ago."
Along with her Cylon mother.
And human father.
Commercialism, decadence,
technology run amok.
- Remind you of anything?
- Take your pick.
Kobol,
Earth...
The real Earth before this one.
Caprica before the fall.
- All of this has happened before...
- But the question remains.
Does all of this
have to happen again?
This time, I bet no.
Never known you to play the optimist.
Why the change of heart?
Mathematics, law of averages.
Let a complex system
repeat itself long enough,
eventually something surprising
might occur.
That too is in God's plan.
You know it doesn't like that name.
Silly me.
Silly, silly me.
Frakking series finale.
So say we all!

NARRATOR: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.
MAN:
This is the Battlestar Pegasus
to the ship claiming to be
the Galactica.
Please respond.
TlGH: Pegasus?
How can that be?
The entire fleet
was destroyed.
Adm. Cain.
On behalf of the officers
and the crew of the Pegasus,
welcome back
to the Colonial Fleet.
The Cylon fleet is composed
of two base ships,
about a dozen
or so support ships
and one large vessel
that we are still
unable to identify.
It's this large ship here
that I'm interested in.
I'm going to integrate
the crews.
I thought you said
you had no desire
to interfere with my command.
I'm Laird, Pegasus Deck Chief.
You're an
aeronautical engineer?
Yeah, I was.
So you're really a civilian?
I was on the Scylla
and we got picked up
by the Pegasus.
Things happen.
How much time do I have?
Weeks, a month at the outside.
Will I be able to work?
Unless the cancer
goes to your brain.
If that happens, you...
CAlN: We have
our own Cylon prisoner.
NO. 6: She's obviously been
abused. Tortured.
Will you help her, Gaius?
You really want to get close,
you got to use
the stealth ship we
constructed aboard Galactica.
APOLLO: Carbon composite?
It's gonna be hard as hell
to see on dradis.
Starbuck,
you're off this mission.
A surveillance package?
Go get the Blackbird,
take some pretty pictures
of our Cylon ship.
Who the hell's this Thorne?
GAGE: Lt. Thorne, sir.
Your little robot girl
is in for quite a ride.
TYROL: Get off her!
...either of you
frakking move! Don't move!
They've been found guilty
on all counts.
She's going to execute
them both for murder
and treason.
Galactica is launching Vipers
and a Raptor.
Why are you launching Vipers?
I'm getting my men.
Launch the alert Vipers.
KAT: Galactica, Kat. I've got
inbound Pegasus Vipers
coming right at me.
Request instructions.
We've gotta let 'em
defend themselves.
We should turn our main
batteries on Pegasus.
(CLlCKlNG)
(ALARM BLARlNG)
KAT: Galactica, Kat.
Request weapons free.
We need your help.
DUALLA: Kat, Galactica.
Do not fire unless fired upon.
I repeat,
do not fire unless fired upon.
Galactica, Kat.
They're really frakking
with us out here!
HOTDOG: Galactica, Hotdog.
One of them just pulled
into my kill slot.
HOTDOG: Got him in range.
Locking on.
Galactica, standing by...
(GRUNTlNG)
PlLOT 1: Hotdog,
watch yourself,
he's right behind you!
HOTDOG:
Evasive action, come on!
Frakking frakkers!
Okay.
You're gonna have to
break your course now.
HOSHl: Narcho, Pegasus.
Do not fire first.
HOSHl: Stinger, Pegasus.
You are ordered to relieve
Capt. Adama of duty
and aid in the attack mission
on Galactica.
STlNGER: Your weapon, Captain.
You're relieved.
HOSHl: Rock Star,
this is Pegasus.
What's your call position?
PlLOT 2:...around your wing.
Come around, come around!
Permission to go aft.
Granted.
KAT: This one attempted
to shoot at me.
He's right on top of me!
HOSHl: Break away! Break away!
You're too close!
Come on, break.
Frak me! They're all over us!
Galactica,
request weapons free.
KAT: They're coming around
for another pass.
Repeat, request weapons free!
Come on, Starbuck.
Tell me
you're out there somewhere.
(WHlSPERlNG)
What the hell is...
(BEEPlNG)
STARBUCK: Starbuck here.
What the hell is going on?
HOTDOG:
Warning! Watch your back!
GAETA: Dradis contact!
A single bogey
and it's nearly on top of us!
Identify.
No transponders,
no recognition codes,
it has to be
a Cylon Raider, sir.
Admiral, sir,
she's gotta be a Raider.
Well, how the frak
did it get in so close
without being detected?
I don't know, sir.
I assure you it came
out of nowhere.
PlLOT 3: Pegasus,
request vertical cross.
Right.
PlLOT 4: They're just
everywhere, Captain.
They're coming up close!
Recall the Vipers,
bring the ship about
and prepare
to engage the enemy.
HOSHl: All Pegasus Vipers,
all Pegasus Vipers,
emergency recall.
There's a Cylon Raider
right on top of you.
DUALLA: Attention,
all Galactica Vipers,
you got a Cylon Raider
coming right at you.
There you are, you bastard.
On my lead!
Break right, full power,
X-axis climb!
Starbuck to all Vipers,
do not fire.
Repeat, do not fire.
I'm a friendly, okay?
We're all friendlies,
so let's just be friendly.
That's no Raider, that's that
stealth ship of yours.
It was flying and it wasn't
cleared to launch.
You got me. I'm just
a passenger back here.
Galactica, Kat.
It's the Blackbird, Galactica.
KAT: Repeat,
it's the Blackbird.
What the hell
is the Blackbird
doing out there?
HOTDOG:
All pilots hold fire.
It's Starbuck.
She launched in the Blackbird
a couple hours ago,
said she was running
flight tests for Adm. Cain.
That doesn't sound likely.
Another one of her
crazy-assed stunts.
Thank the gods!
You can say that again.
Get me Pegasus.
This is Pegasus Actual,
go ahead.
We can either stand-down
or we could start shooting
at each other.
It's your call.
Admiral.
Wait one.
We're receiving a download,
Admiral.
That is the Cylon fleet.
Are these from our
recon mission?
No, sir. The recon mission
was aborted.
These are from Blackbird.
Thrace.
She took off
and did the whole
recon mission alone.
My gods,
look at these shots, Jack.
She put her nose
right up their backsides,
and they never even knew it.
Admiral, I still have
Commander Adama on the line,
and our fighters are still
requesting instructions.
Should they resume the attack?
All right. Joint recall.
Both ships stand-down
to Condition Two.
Then I want you to report
to me directly. In person.
I have no intention
of cooling my heels
in your brig.
Fine.
Neutral ground.
Colonial One, no aides.
Be there in 15 minutes.
Stand-down, Condition Two.
There you are.
ROSLlN: Let's start this
by admitting an ugly truth.
What happened out there today
was the result of failure
in leadership
of everyone in this room.
We are the leaders
of this fleet.
As such, we need
to set an example.
We cannot continue
to let the conflicts
between us...
Oh, let's cut through
the hand-holding, shall we?
Two of his men murdered
one of my officers
while protecting a Cylon.
They're guilty.
They admitted it.
And under regulations
I have complete authority
to try, convict
and sentence them.
And you and I both know
that the penalty
for that crime is death.
Admiral, surely
the spirit of the law
requires something more here
than summary executions.
Is this what the two of you
have been doing
for the past six months?
Debating the finer points
of Colonial law?
Well, guess what?
We're at war.
And we don't have the luxury
of academic debate
over these issues.
You want to cut through it,
fine.
You have Pegasus,
he has Galactica.
Two heavily armed,
very powerful warships.
Now, I am sure that Pegasus
would prevail in any fight.
I wouldn't count on that.
ROSLlN: But certainly
there'd be heavy damage,
and you'd take
significant casualties.
So you can go out there
and fight it out
with Galactica,
or you can compromise.
And those are
the only two options
on the table, period.
How the two of you
have survived this long,
I will never know.
All right. Lt. Thrace
has sent me detailed
recon information
on the Cylon fleet.
I want that fleet.
And I need Galactica
to get it. So I'm willing
to go this far.
I'll suspend the executions
until after the attack.
I want them back on Galactica.
I don't give a damn
what you want.
You're frakking lucky
you're not staring
at your own warrant.
The destruction
of the Cylon fleet
will take priority
over all other considerations.
After that, we will meet
back here and we will
resolve this issue.
Thank you.
Stand at ease, Lieutenant,
and come forward.
It seems you've had
quite a day.
I'm promoting you to Captain.
I'm making you Commander
of the Pegasus Air Group.
You're promoting me?
I need a CAG with guts
and initiative
to plan and lead
the attack on this fleet.
Now, I thought
Stinger was that man,
but he managed to let
Capt. Adama contact you
and pull off that fly-by stunt
right under his nose,
so he's out.
And Capt. Adama, sir?
Truth be told,
I came this close
to throwing him in the brig,
but I couldn't exactly
charge him and not you,
so I've just revoked
his flight status.
I want him on my team, sir.
And do you always
get what you want?
Most of the time, sir.
Good.
Me, too.
All right, you can have him.
I hear you want to return
to Caprica.
Yes, sir.
We have people
back there still alive.
Yes, and they deserve
to be saved.
I absolutely agree.
In fact, I will go
one step further
and I will say
that our ultimate goal
is that we should return
to the 12 Colonies
and kick the Cylons
the frak out of our homes.
What do you think
of that, Captain?
I think that's the best idea
I've heard all day, sir.
I'm afraid this can only
end one way.
You've gotta kill her.
What the hell
are you talking about?
Like she said,
let's cut through it.
The two of you
were willing to go
to war today.
Do you think she's going
to step down from that?
She's gonna bide her time
and hit you
the first chance she gets.
That's a given.
I hate to lay this on you,
Bill, but she is dangerous,
and the only thing
that you can do is to hit her
before she hits you.
I'm not an assassin.
No.
You're not an assassin.
You are a Colonial officer
who has taken an oath
to protect this fleet.
What do you think
that she is going to do
with the civilian fleet
once she has eliminated you?
You know I'm right.
You just don't wanna face it.
Has the whole world gone mad?
COTTLE: Your fluid
and electrolyte levels
are stable.
I think the baby's
gonna be fine.
You do have a cracked rib,
though,
a hairline fracture,
which means it's gonna hurt
like hell for a while.
But I'm not seeing
any signs of permanent damage
from the attack.
The attack.
Is that what we're
calling it now?
They were not
from the Galactica.
They were from the Pegasus.
So what?
What about Helo and the Chief?
I heard a rumor
they're gonna be executed.
I'm not gonna
let that happen.
Well,
how're you gonna do that?
Isn't Adm. Cain in command?
What happened to you...
COTTLE: Was unforgivable.
...happened aboard my ship,
on my watch,
and it's my responsibility.
So I just want you to know
that I personally apologize.
See that she's okay,
then back into her cell.
Aren't we supposed to be dead?
Admiral said
execution in an hour.
It's been at least two.
Hey, I'm not complaining.
COMPUTER:
ID confirmed.
(DOOR OPENlNG)
So, just how many different
kinds of stupid are you?
More than we can count.
What's going on, Captain?
Good news,
you're not dead yet.
Bad news,
it's a delay, not a pardon.
There's a big op coming up,
and the firing squad's
on hold till it's over.
Yeah, the old man went
to the mat for you guys
on this one, and then some.
We were this close
to a shooting war
with the Pegasus.
Frak me.
What the hell's going on?
I thought the Cylons
were the enemy.
Yeah. Now it's us.
What's wrong, Gaius?
Nothing.
Nothing.
I suppose I just
Iost interest.
In me?
No, not in you. In...
In this. In this place.
I suppose I just don't
really miss it anymore.
You know what I miss?
Sports.
You're joking.
No.
I used to go
to the pyramid court
just before game time.
Scalp two tickets.
If I timed it right,
I'd just be sitting down
at the horn.
Sit back.
Let the energy of the crowd
flow over me.
Waves and waves of emotion.
Like electric current.
Why did you get two tickets?
One for me and one for you.
I knew I'd never
get you to go.
Pyramid was far too lowbrow
for you. But...
I always liked to feel
that you were there with me.
(DOOR OPENlNG)
COMPUTER:
ID confirmed.
Well, I see that you
got it to eat.
That's progress, I suppose.
Can you get it to roll over,
beg?
(SCOFFlNG)
See what it
can make of these.
You know, this thing
used to sit in our mess
and eat our food
and listen to our stories.
Didn't you?
You just sat there,
Iistening to us,
pretending to be our friend.
Didn't you?
Admiral, please!
Any physical contact
with the subject
will only help
to set my efforts back
at this point.
Find out about that ship.
(SCREAMlNG)
I want to die.
Will you help me do that?
Will you kill me, please?
(GlNA SOBBlNG)
I'm just still getting up
to speed on the way you do
things around here,
but I'm reasonably sure
that we can have
all the birds in the air
for the attack thing, sure.
I mean, yes, sir.
Thank you, Chief.
MAN 1: Hey! Hey!
(CRASHlNG)
MAN 2: I got it, I got it.
MAN 1: Give me a hand.
Cally.
Laird's not military, is he?
No, sir.
He was a civilian
aeronautical engineer
on a ship called the Scylla.
Civilian?
Do you know how he got
on the Pegasus?
Scuttlebutt is that
the Pegasus used to have
a civilian fleet,
but something
happened to them.
Thank you.
Laird's ship was the Scylla.
The Scylla was
a civilian transport.
We found her
and a few other civies
about a week after the attack.
They were good ships.
FTL drives and weapons, even.
A lot of potential
spare parts that we
could use on Pegasus.
So the Admiral
made a decision.
Military needs are a priority.
You stripped them.
You stripped the ships
for parts.
Sweet mother of Artemis.
How much equipment
did you take?
You take their jump drives?
Left all those people
marooned out there?
No, not all.
Adm. Cain looked over
the passenger list
and she made a decision
about who was valuable
and who wasn't.
Scylla was the toughest.
Laird and 15
other men and women.
They were all...
All traveling
with their families,
wives, husbands, children.
The selectees
refused to go.
There was resistance.
So, the order came down
to shoot the family
of anyone who refused to come.
So we did.
Two families. We put them
up against the bulkhead
and we shot them.
The CAG's work is never done.
Hi. How're you doing?
Oh, you mean
apart from being demoted,
finding myself working
for one of my pilots?
Great. Never better.
You know I had nothing
to do with that, right?
Never thought you did.
I just checked in
on Helo and Tyrol.
They're hanging tight for now.
Good.
Help me plan this op.
I've been staring
at this roster...
Do you want to just carry on
as if nothing's happened?
Lee, she's in command.
What do you wanna do?
There's nothing we can do.
I thought you might like
a fresh set of clothes.
Were you aware of your
true nature as a Cylon
when you boarded the ship
or would you describe
yourself as a sleeper agent?
I knew what I was.
I was a soldier.
I had a mission,
I carried it out.
I thought that when it was
done, I was going to die.
That you would kill me.
Then l... Then I would
download into a new body.
Be reborn.
But you didn't kill me.
The things you did to me...
What they did to you
was wrong, evil.
But I'm not one of them.
You have to believe me.
Things are going to get
better for you
from this moment on.
I promise.
I don't want things
to get better. I want to die.
But you know you can't die.
You do know that, don't you?
Your consciousness will merely
transfer, and you'll wake up
in another body.
Not if you destroy that.
What, this?
This ship? Tell me,
what's so important
about this ship?
The Cylons call this
their Resurrection ship.
At the moment,
we are too far away
from the Cylon home world
for the normal
downloading process to work.
Which is why
they built this ship.
It contains the entire
apparatus necessary
for Cylon resurrection.
Now, this ship has been
traveling with the fleet,
trailing Galactica
for the last several months.
So it's a safety net.
A place where they fall
back to when they die.
And if they lose
their safety net...
Then any Cylon
who dies out here...
Would be dead.
As in, really dead.
And I dare say
they won't like that.
No, sir.
They might even
stop chasing us.
Why risk getting killed
if you can't just wake up
all nice and cozy
in a brand-new body?
Doctor, I think
you've just identified
the most important ship
in the galaxy.
I have good days
and bad days,
but don't look so worried,
I'm not dying today.
I wasn't worried.
What can I do for you?
You were right about Cain.
Pegasus had a civilian fleet
with her.
Fifteen ships.
Cain stripped them
for parts, supplies,
people.
I wish I could say
I was surprised,
but it's who she is.
She's playing for keeps.
You gotta do the same.
What's gotten into you?
What?
You've become
so bloody-minded.
I know that as long
as Cain lives,
your survival is at risk.
I know that.
(COUGHlNG)
What can I get you?
A new body.
Perhaps one of those
young Cylon models
from the Resurrection ship?
I can't see you as a blonde.
You'd be surprised.
I'll see you tomorrow?
Mmm-hmm.
Commander,
she won't hesitate
to kill you.
Don't let her.
You know,
when we get out of here,
I'm gonna make some changes.
Yeah?
Like what?
Me and Sharon.
It's done.
I mean, really done.
I can't do it anymore.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
LT, what we did,
I would do again
in a heartbeat.
I gotta let it go.
I so thought I'd let go.
Yeah,
I know what you mean.
You?
Yeah, me.
What, you think I don't have
second thoughts sometimes?
You think I don't wonder if
I'm losing my frakking mind?
I'm in love with a woman
I know isn't a woman.
I'm having a baby that's...
That's what, half machine?
You really do love her,
don't you?
Yeah.
Yes, I do.
And I can't let go of it.
But if you can, let her go.
Our primary objective
is a vessel named
Resurrection by the Cylons.
It's guarded by
two Base Stars,
which have been following us
throughout this sector.
Our plan, simply put,
is to let them find us.
We will wait
in this system here,
and appear to be conducting
mining operations.
STARBUCK: When the Cylons
launch their Raiders,
Galactica and most
of the civilians
will jump away.
A small group of civilians
will be left behind.
To the Cylons,
they'll appear
to be having trouble
with their FTL drives
and attempting to escape
at sub-light speed.
The Cylon Raiders
pursue the civilian decoys,
pulling the Raiders
farther away from the Cylon
Base Stars as they can.
APOLLO: Once the Raiders have
been drawn off by the decoys,
Galactica and Pegasus
will jump in and attack
the Base Stars,
while I jump in
in the Blackbird
stealth fighter
and take out the FTL drives
on the Resurrection ship,
preventing it
from jumping away.
Why not have the stealth ship
carry nukes and destroy it
right at the start?
We ran simulations on that.
We determined
that the Cylons would detect
the nuclear warheads
and destroy the stealth ship
before it got
within weapons range.
When the FTL is destroyed,
Galactica and Pegasus
will take on the Base Stars,
and our attack squadrons
will go after the Resurrection
ship itself.
How many squadrons?
All of them.
Is there a problem,
Commander?
I need time to study
the operational details.
Suit yourself.
I've gone over the details
and I'm satisfied.
I want your CAG to stay
and help me answer
some of my questions.
One hour, Thrace.
Yes, sir.
Stay focused, son.
Jack, I want to transfer
a detachment of Marines
to Galactica.
And I want you
to hand-pick them.
Completely reliable.
Completely loyal.
Razors.
I have a mission for you,
Kara.
Anything for you.
You know that.
Don't accept too quickly.
You won't like this one.
I don't like it.
But I've decided
that it has to be done.
I'm transferring you
to Galactica as well.
I'll tell Adama that
you're there to be
my eyes and ears.
He'll hate it,
he'll think you're my spy
and try to freeze you out
of decision-making,
but he'll accept it.
Now, I want you to stay
in ClC throughout the attack.
Stay with Adama.
ADAMA: After the attack
is completed,
and you've accounted
for your pilots,
I want you to land your bird
on the Pegasus to report
directly to ClC.
You'll take Lee with you.
He'll watch your back.
Position Marines
in key areas throughout
the ship and keep a squad
posted just outside ClC.
Now, there will be the normal
chaos and emotional high
after the attack.
They'll be slapping
each other on the back,
celebrating the victory.
That'll keep their guard down.
Security will be lax.
I will ask for you
over the wireless.
I will call you directly.
And when I have you
on the line
and you hear me
give the command "Execute
case orange"...
When you hear me
say "Downfall"...
...you are to signal
the Marines to terminate
Adama's command.
Start it with Adama.
...I want you
to pull out your weapon
and shoot Adm. Cain
in the head.
NARRATOR: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.
I'm promoting you to Captain.
I'm making you commander
of the Pegasus Air Group.
You're promoting me?
I need a CAG with guts.
We are the leaders
of this fleet.
As such, we need
to set an example.
Oh, let's just
cut through the
hand-holding, shall we?
CAlN: Two of his men
murdered one of my officers
while protecting a Cylon.
They're guilty.
They admitted it.
And under regulations,
I have complete authority
to try, convict
and sentence them.
And you and I both know
that the penalty for
that crime is death.
ROSLlN: I'm afraid
there's only one end to this.
You've gotta kill her.
Well, I see you got it to eat.
That's progress, I suppose.
Can you get it
to roll over, beg?
(SCOFFlNG)
BALTAR: Admiral, please!
I thought you might like
a fresh set of clothes.
You know what I miss?

This is a frakked up thing
that I've been asked to do,
but we kill people
for a living.
They say shoot, we shoot.
So you're
gonna do this?
Yeah.
I'm gonna do it.
Kara.
I could use
some back-up.
I'll understand
if you can't.
You know better
than that.
Yeah, I guess so.
People have to
have this, Kara.
Trust.
Your word
and my word.
If we don't
have this, then
we really are
no different
than the Cylons.
Thank you.

Oh, lookee here.

Hey, you?
You call me "sir. "
Yes, sir.
So I guess you were both
getting your poles greased
by that filthy little
robot girl, huh?
I'm sorry.
I don't think
I quite heard that right.
The glass...
I can't hear you.
So, why don't you
open the door,
come in, and we'll talk
about it in here?
That's a great idea, Chief.
Oh, they really
wanna do this.
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

Slow it down, slow it down.

What the frak is this?
Don't worry, sir.
I'll take it real slow, sir.
TYROL: Hey!
(TYROL GRUNTlNG)
See, the gut,
it's a vulnerable area.
Lt. Thorne
told me that once.
He said, "lf you really
wanna do some damage
without leaving a mark,
"go for the gut."
You'd be surprised
what you can do
with the simplest things.
A bar of soap,
plain old towel.
How bad
could it be, right?
You'd be surprised.

FlSK: Attention on deck!
Gage, Vireem.
Out of the cell,
standing tall,
right here!
FlSK: Remove the restraints
from the prisoners.
Specialist Gage,
let me ask you something.
Those men in there,
are they wearing
Colonial uniforms?
Yes, sir.
Specialist Vireem,
do you agree
with Specialist Gage here
that those are, in fact,
Colonial officers?
Yes, sir.
They killed Lieutenant...
Shut your frakking mouth!
See, I don't
quite understand
what I just saw.
Because I think I saw
you two knuckle-draggers
treating those men
like they were Cylons,
which of course
couldn't be right.
Because, if in fact
that was the case,
then you're both subject
to charges of assaulting
a chief and a lieutenant
under color of authority
in a time of war,
which, if I'm not mistaken,
carries a penalty
on this ship
that is quite severe.
Now, get the hell
out of here.
Sir.
Sir.
Get out.
Yes, sir.
Sir.
(TYROL COUGHlNG)
Thank you.
Thank you, Colonel.
I don't want your thanks.
I owe Lt. Thorne my life,
as do many people
on this ship.
He was trying
to rape a prisoner.
You can't rape a machine,
Lieutenant.
COMPUTER: ID confirmed.
Do you drink, Thrace?
Only to excess, sir.
(CLEARS THROAT)
"Only to excess"?
Learn that from
Col. Tigh, did you?
Not exactly.
I understand
you belted him once.
(STAMMERlNG) You gonna...
That was something I did
without really thinking.
Don't apologize.
Some people get exactly
what they deserve.
From what I've read
about your XO,
maybe he needs
to get popped in the mouth
every once in a while, hmm?
I know you're
very close with Adama.
Yes, sir.
And I know
he's a good man.
And I know he's had to make
some very hard choices
over the last few months.
Lord knows I have.
Well, then maybe you can
understand why he did
what he thought he had to do
when you said you were
gonna execute Helo and Tyrol.
Let me tell you something.
I've had to watch
a lot of kids
be put into body bags.
They're covered with flags
and they float
out that airlock.
You think I don't understand
his feelings toward his men?
Sometimes,
terrible things
have to be done.
Inevitably,
each and every one of us
will have to face a moment
where we have to commit
that horrible sin.
And if we flinch
in that moment,
if we hesitate for one second,
if we let our conscience
get in the way,
you know what happens?
There are more kids
in those body bags,
more kids
floating out
that airlock.
Now, I don't know why,
but I have
a lot of faith in you.
And I want you
to promise me
that when that moment comes,
you won't flinch.
Do not flinch.
(KNOCKlNG AT DOOR)
ADAMA: Come in.
Courier run
from Pegasus, sir.
They got you doing
courier runs now, huh?
Well, l...
I volunteered for this one.
Kara told me
about her...
Her mission.
Come to change my mind?
I just wanted
to hear it from you.
Decision's been made.
Assassination?
That's your decision?
That's how you resolve
your differences
with your superior officers?
If you're gonna
have some problem
backing up Starbuck,
I can find somebody else.
It's not about me
watching her back.
I'm not going
to debate this
with you.
This was
a very hard decision.
But I think
the President's right.
This is the best way
to safeguard the fleet.
The... The President?
So you and...
You and the President?
This is...
Yes.
She's made of sterner stuff
than people give her
credit for.
Is this all I have to sign?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Lieutenant,
it's good to see you.

Yeah.
Sorry about
a lot of things.
Be sure your Marines
and our Marines

of responsibility in case
we're boarded by the Cylons.
The last thing we need
is Colonials
shooting at each other.
Amen to that.
ADAMA: (VOlCEOVER)
Wait outside.
GUARD: Yes, sir.
Sit down.
I've asked you here
to find out why
the Cylons hate us so much.
I'm not sure
I know how
to answer that.
I mean, "hate" might not be
the right word.
I don't want to
fence with you.
I just want to know why.
It's what you said
at the ceremony.
Before the attack,
when Galactica
was being decommissioned.
You gave a speech.
Sounded like it wasn't
the one you prepared.
You said that humanity
was a flawed creation.
And that people still
kill one another
for petty jealousy
and greed.
You said that humanity
never asked itself
why it deserved to survive.
Maybe you don't.
Resurrection ship's

They're getting ready

God will not forgive this sin.
Do you think God

God forgives all.
Don't listen to her.
You think
she can help you?
You think that

even a fraction
of what I can?
I know God's

I know how
to help you
fulfill your destiny.
Do you know
what I miss most?
You're going to laugh
when I tell you this.
Sports.
Don't do this.
Yeah, that's right.
I used to love
getting to the pyramid game
just before tip-off.
By timing it right,
I could sit down
right at the horn.
And then let the emotion
of the crowd
flood over me,
waves and waves of it.
Like electric current.
That's beautiful.
And I always
had two tickets.
No.

Please.
...and one for you.

The Resurrection ship

Yes!
(CREW CLAPPlNG AND CHEERlNG)
They've done it.
RACETRACK: Clear!
(GASPlNG)
RACETRACK: He's all right.
He's a little shaken,
but I say again,
Apollo is all right.
All the remaining Cylons

It's over, sir.
(CREW CHEERlNG)
Congratulations, gentlemen.
I'm ready to die.
Send my soul to God.
Please.
I wish you were here, Lee.
But what the hell.
I am so very proud of you.
TlGH: Secure from
Condition One.
Set Condition Two
throughout the ship.
Division officers submit
casualty and damage report
to Combat.
(SlGHlNG)
Glad we didn't need
your Marines today.
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.
DUALLA: Signal from
the flagship, sir.
Adm. Cain on the line.
Put her through.
Congratulations, Commander.
Congratulations
to you, too, Admiral.
A significant victory.
Is Starbuck with you?
Yes, she is.
This is Starbuck.
I've been thinking about
what we talked about before.
It's not enough to survive.
One has to be
worthy of surviving.
That's all.
I think that's very wise, sir.
Thank you.
Commander, I wonder if my XO
is standing close by?
Yes, he is.
FlSK: Yes, sir.
Congratulations, Jack.
Thank you, sir.
That's all.
Yes, sir.
You look like
you could use a drink.
(SlGHlNG)
Thank you.
Oh, by the way,
there was something
I wanted to tell you.
Last night, I was walking
down this corridor here,
when I saw...
(NECK SNAPPlNG)
No, no, no.
I can't...
I can't do this.
Suicide is a sin.
But I need to die.
What you need is justice.
I know a place
where you can stay,
where you will be safe,
where I can
look after you.
Why?
Why would you do that?
Because I love you.
(SlGHlNG)
Tell me, Admiral,
can you roll over?
Beg?
Frak you.
You're not my type.
FlSK: And she died knowing
that her ship and her crew
were safe,
and that her mission
had been accomplished.
Nothing was more important
to her than her ship,
her crew, and her mission.
And as I take command
of Pegasus, I pledge
to uphold those values
that made her
such an effective
and heroic leader.
I only knew
Adm. Cain
for a short time.
So what I have
to say about her
will be short.
She faced things.
She looked them
right in the eye
and she didn't flinch.
That's something
that we do a lot
around here.
We second guess.
We worry.
When I think about
what she went through
after the attack...
All alone,
one ship, no help,
no hope...
She didn't give up.
She didn't worry.
She didn't second guess.
She acted.
She did what she thought
needed to be done,
and the Pegasus survived.
It might be hard to admit,
or hard to hear,
but I think that
we were safer with her
than we are without.
STARBUCK: Lee.
Lee, you okay?
Are you okay?
No. Not really.
Hey...
I broke my word to you.
What are you
talking about?
I let you down.
I wasn't there
when you needed me.
Look,
a close call like that...
That'd mess
with anybody's head.
All right?
It turns out I didn't
need you anyway, so...
Let's just be glad
that we both came back
alive, all right?
That's just it, Kara.
I didn't want to
make it back alive.
(SOBBlNG) I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.
Same here.
BOOMER: So,
where do we go from here?
ROSLlN: So, how did the Cylon
manage to get off
the Pegasus undetected?
No one really knows.
There was so much chaos
in the aftermath
of the attack.
Thank the gods
that you did not have
to do what I advised.
That makes me
very happy.
Yes. Thank the gods.
How are you feeling?
Well, I could sleep
for about a year, but...
But you, however,
do not have that luxury
because you have a new job.
Billy?
It took a little while
to find that jeweler.
Thank you.
Rumor has it
that I know very little
about military protocol,
but I do believe
that someone who commands
more than one ship
is called an Admiral.
Congratulations,
Adm. Adama.
Thank you, Madam President.
Thank you, Billy.
I never gave up hope.
I just stopped trying
to get these a long time ago.
Just goes to show you, Bill,
never give up hope.
Same goes for you, Laura.
Hmm.
All right.
NARRATOR: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

I give you
your new vice-president,
Dr. Gaius Baltar.
(ALL APPLAUDlNG)
You're the father of my child
and nothing is ever
gonna change that.
I know a place
where you can stay
where you will be safe.
How much time do I have?
Weeks. A month at the outside
Unless the cancer
goes to your brain.
If that happens...
(DOOR SLAMMlNG)
I'm afraid
the tests are positive.
The mass is malignant.
It's advanced
well beyond the left breast.

the tests are positive.
Ms. Roslin,

will remove the mass.
(MEN CHATTERlNG)
STANS: Secretary Roslin?
Yes?
Naylin Stans,
from the Education Alliance.
You said you wanted to talk.
Yes.
I'm sorry, Mr. Stans.
STANS: Have to admit
I was surprised
to get your message.
ROSLlN: The President
was surprised I sent it.
Once our chief negotiator
got a billy-club to the head,
we figured Adar's government
had written us off
as a lost cause.
I was a teacher long before
I was Secretary of Education.
And causes are only lost
when we give up.
(GASPlNG)
Madam President,
can you hear me?
COTTLE: Let's make her
as comfortable as we can.
(CARDlOGRAPH BEEPlNG)
Oh, gods...

STARBUCK: (ON RADlO)
Starbuck, zero four niner.

Zero four niner.
Safe flight.
Safe
and 20 frakking minutes late.
Did you have a rough night,
Starbuck?
STARBUCK: (ON RADlO)
You're way out of line.
Just follow my lead
and save the attitude
for someone who cares.
KAT: Kat, six seven zero.
Roger that.
Request permission
to clear guns.
STARBUCK: Roger that, Kat.
Clear your throat.
Damn it!
Weapons malfunction!
Weapons malfunction!
Galactica.
Kat! Are you good?
I'm good, I'm good.
What the hell just happened?
STARBUCK:
Your port gun's blown.
Just keep it steady.
We're heading home.
Galactica, this is Starbuck.
I'm declaring an emergency.
We've got two bent birds,
requesting priority clearance
to land.
LSO: (ON RADlO)
Starbuck, Galactica.
Flight deck is yours.
Why don't you just shoot us
in the locker room, Chief?
Save the wear and tear
on the ships.
Kat's guns are clean.
I checked them myself.
Yeah, well,
I don't believe in accidents.
Chief,
something's not right.
The weight's off.
It's too light.
I found three more
just like it, mixed in
with the regular rounds.
The casing's been weakened.
It falls apart in the barrel,
the next one hits it, bang!
She's lucky
she didn't lose
her whole wing.
One bad round's a fluke.
More than one is sabotage.
Pull them all!
CREWMAN: All right,
you heard the Chief!
Let's pull them all! Let's go!
ADAMA: How is
the President doing, Doc?
She's dying,
and she knows it.
I offered her a shot of morpha
to ease the pain,
but she wouldn't hear of it.
The tests are positive.
ROSLlN: They're teachers
not terrorists.
Mr. President,
we should at least speak
with the strikers
before sending in
the troops.
They're teachers
not terrorists.
They're acting like thugs.
Their last demonstration
put two policemen
in the hospital.
Six of them
have chained themselves
outside the Hall of Education.
As far as I'm concerned,
they're criminals.
Their pay is sub-standard,
their schools
are falling apart,
and this strike action
has been gaining momentum
for months and you know that.
I don't understand
why we're not
at least talking to them.
One of the most
interesting things
about being president
is that you don't have to
explain yourself to anyone.
You've already set
a meeting with Stans,
haven't you?
Obviously only if you approve,
Mr. President.
BALTAR: She's really in no
good state to do anything,
Iet alone to conduct
any Government business.
Don't talk about me
as if I'm not here.
There'll be plenty of time
for that soon enough.
(ROSLlN SNlCKERlNG)
Billy, could you...
Of course.
Gentlemen, I called you here
to discuss the Cylon.
Dr. Cottle, would you...
Would you please tell them
what you told me this morning?
I'm no expert in genetics,
but I can read a blood test.
That Cylon fetus
is showing
some very peculiar
genetic abnormalities.
I haven't seen any of this
on your report, Doctor.
No, well,
as Dr. Cottle says,
he's not an expert and I am.
I've been through the tests
and I wouldn't say that there
was anything conclusive.
I didn't say conclusive,
just damned odd.
Right.
BALTAR: Madam President?
As you know,
the Sharon Cylon
is of considerable
tactical value
to the fleet and...
Perhaps you've gotten
too close to your subject,
Doctor.
This is difficult,
so I'm gonna cut right to it.
Allowing this thing to be born
could have frightening
consequences.
For the security
of this fleet,
I believe the Cylon pregnancy
must be terminated
before it is too late.
Madam President,
I'd like...
I thought you of all people
would understand, Admiral.
BALTAR: Madam President,
I don't understand.
This makes no sense.
One of the interesting things
about being president
is you don't have to
explain yourself to anyone.
Thank you, gentlemen,
I'm a little tired.
Gentlemen?
I don't want to seem alarmist,
but I am perturbed.
I think that
the President's illness
is affecting her judgment.
Especially when it
comes to the subject of...
ADAMA: She seemed
reasonably coherent to me.
Well, then I'll have to appeal
to you on scientific grounds.
Destroying this child
would seriously impact
my studies
of the Cylon subspecies.
The President made the call.
I'm backing her.
With all due respect,
the President made the call
based on evidence
presented by Dr. Cottle
and he...
Pull yourself together.
You're about to become
President of the Colonies.
You're gonna be asked
to make
some very hard decisions.
Act like you can handle it.
Gods.
Where have you been?
Where have I been?
I never left you, Gaius.
All right, yeah.
Yeah, metaphorically speaking.
It's just it was weeks ago
and l...
I'm sure you've suffered
mightily in my absence.
You know, jealousy's
a really ugly emotion.
What is this
lingering controversy
over my affair
with your
three dimensional duplicate?
I'm not jealous,
I'm concerned.
Oh, yeah? Concerned?
About what?
Our child!
You're concerned?
Well, for your information,
the President
intends to kill it!
Once Roslin's gone,
you'll be President.
You can use your new authority
to save our child.
Yeah, yeah. That's good.
Did you see the way
Adama looked at me?
The contempt on his face?
I will be the President,
all right,
but without military support
I might as well be
an anointed dogcatcher.
Yes, well,
you have your own resources,
if you'd use them.
What?
You don't know what I mean?
No, I don't know
what you mean.
The nuclear device.
The one Adama
provided for your research.
There is one way.
NO. 6: I didn't wanna
have to ask...
I didn't wanna have
to ask you for this.
NO. 6: But what
I really need...
But what I really need
to complete the project...
Is a nuclear warhead.
Is a nuclear
warhead.
You're totally insane.
I'm trying to help you,
you idiot.
If Adama remains committed
to the destruction
of our child,
it may be
our only hope.
There's no easy way
to say this.
It's about the Cylon.
The President has decided
that her pregnancy
will be terminated.
What?
Why?
Doc Cottle
discovered some anomalies
in the fetal blood work.
Isn't that expected?
Maybe.
But the President
believes
that to allow the baby
to come to full term,
it constitutes
an unacceptable risk
to the fleet.
I don't understand.
Sharon's only helped us
since she came back
from Caprica.
She even turned on her own.
To save her life.
Don't mistake
the will to live
for genuine compassion,
Lieutenant.
She's still the enemy.
Does she know?
Not yet.
Then I should be the one
to tell her.
If that's all, sir.
Helo.
I don't expect you
to agree to the decision,
but I need you
to accept it.
We're talking about
my child, sir.
Part of me.
But I guess
it's easier to kill
when you call it a Cylon.
Dismissed.
So you're saying
someone's been tampering
with our ammunition?
Shells don't
unload themselves.
What's this I hear
about you ordering
both Galactica
and Pegasus fighters
to stand down?
The price you pay
for reinstating me as CAG,
sir.
Maybe that was a mistake.
Maybe I don't give a damn
what you think, sir.
Take it easy,
both of you.
The fact is
we've been sharing stores
between the ships.
And nobody flies combat
until our ammo supplies
check out.
Leaving us defenseless
if the Cylons
decide to pick a fight.
We were defenseless
before this.
We just didn't know about it.
ADAMA: Lee,
find out who did this.
(MACHlNES BUZZlNG)
APOLLO: All right.
Excuse me,
I'm looking for
Asha Janik.
Asha? She's there.
APOLLO: Let's do this quietly.
APOLLO: Asha Janik?
Captain Adama.
I have a message
for your father.
They may take me...
All right, stop her!
...but I'm one of many!
We have declared war
against Galactica's
army of death!
MAN: Let's go.
The Cylons
aren't our true enemy,
it's the military
that refuses to negotiate!
ASHA: All we want is peace!
Demand peace!
Demand peace!
So much for being discreet,
huh?
ADAMA: We found
these pamphlets
in Janik's quarters.
Some kind of a manifesto.
"Demand peace"
from the Cylons?
Who the hell are these people?
Cylon sympathizers.
I just had no idea
they were this organized.
I want to know
how she got aboard my ship.
The hangar deck's
short-staffed.
We've been forced
to import civilians to handle
some of the grunt work.
Apparently she's...
She's a Picon,
worked maintenance
on the Greenleaf,
no known criminal
affiliations.
Until now.
Now listen to this,
"Do not be afraid.
We are not terrorists,
but we will not sit back
"while Adama's war machine
continues to press us
"into cruel
and futile conflict."
Gods damn it.
Well, her demonstration's
worked.
The news is already spreading
across the fleet.
I know.
We were contacted by a person
claiming to speak
for the subversives,
demanding a meeting
on the Galactica.
Well, they've got stones,
I'll give them that.
ADAMA: Well, I've agreed.
What?
We're not negotiating.
I just wanna know
what we're up against.
(GASPlNG)
(MOANlNG)
(DISTORTED TALKING)
STANS: Considering the stakes,
you don't seem
particularly engaged.
The stakes
are what we decide
to make them, Mr. Stans.
If the President uses troops
to enforce
his back-to-work order,
people will get hurt.
Even die.
Some causes
are worth dying for.
Not this one.
(GASPlNG)
DOCTOR: The mass is malignant.
Doctor...
(GASPlNG)
Admiral.
I am Royan Jahee.
You have a unique way
of welcoming visitors
to your ship.
TlGH: Visitor my ass.
We shoot people like you
for treason.
Colonel, I'm only
an interested party,
trying to prevent
more bloodshed.
I deplore what happened
aboard your Vipers.
How many sympathizers
do we have
aboard this fleet?
If you're trying
to crush an organization,
you can stop now.
The people in this movement
are following an idea,
not a leader.
What the hell do they want?
Peace with the Cylon.
You want us to surrender.
They attacked us.
Only after
we'd enslaved them!
You call yourselves
military men, strategists!
Explain to me
how our current course
of attack and retreat
Ieads to victory!
You can play
innocent bystander,
but I think you know more
than you're telling us.
Either way,
you're a danger to this fleet.
Admiral, arresting me
isn't going to stop
any of this.
Maybe not,
but it's a start.
Take him away.
All right,
get your rubber gloves on.
This is everything from
the Janik woman's quarters.
Somehow the Admiral thinks
looking through this crap
is gonna tell us
something new about
their so-called movement.
So, um,
I haven't seen much of you
since your spacewalk.
APOLLO: Hold it.
What's this?
What's a deckhand need
with a portable
library reader?
The Daru Mozu.
A Tylium refinery.
And Janik's
used to explosives.
This is the CAG.
Get me a TAC team ready.
Right now.
BOOMER: (ON TELEPHONE)
I don't understand.
Why are they doing this now?
I don't know.
The Admiral said
they found something
in the baby's blood.
Somehow President Roslin
considers it
a threat to the fleet.
It can't just be that.
I've done nothing
but help them
since I've come here.
I've held back my anger.
I've tried to show them
that Cylons
are not all the same.
That we're not all murderers.
Deep down,
I think they're still
afraid of you.
Yeah.
Afraid.
They wanna be afraid
of something?
Yeah? Just let them come.
Let them!
Let them just try
to take my baby!
(GRUNTlNG)
Let them try to take my baby.
Sharon, stop!
(SCREAMlNG)
Sharon, please, don't do this.
Please!
(YELLlNG)
HELO: Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
HELO: Sharon, look at me.
GUARD: Let's go.
Hey! Easy!
Easy!
When we land, move fast.
We're looking for
explosive devices
set near the Daru's FTL drive.
Captain, I'm getting something
on the wireless.
I think it's coming
from the Daru Mozu.
WOMAN: (ON RADlO) None of us
wants to die,
but the fighting must end.
If my sacrifice
sends a signal to the Cylon
that brings peace,
then it was worth it.
I do this for my children
and for the children that will
follow them, gods willing.
Demand peace.
Pull out!
Demand peace.
Pull out! Pull out!
Pull out! Pull out!
(MACHlNE BEEPlNG)
People are dead.
I grieve for them, Admiral.
And I assure you
the Tylium ship's just a taste
of what's in store
unless someone
starts listening!
(GROANlNG)
You listen,
and you listen well.
I don't care
if I have to interrogate
every civilian
onboard this fleet.
This is gonna stop.
Do you understand?
(GROANlNG) Yes.
BlLLY: Mr. Vice President,
President Roslin insisted
on your taking the tour.
She'd like the transition
to go as smoothly
as possible.
BALTAR: What are these?
Cylon agent suspects, sir.
That number
means everything to her.
It represents hope.
It's our future.
Yes. Yes.
Being the President is
a lot of responsibility.
It's tradition
for outgoing Presidents
to leave a letter
for their successor.
It's usually opened
on the first day
of the new term.
But the next few days
are likely to prove
hectic, so...
Well, let's just pray
that she gets better.
Let's.
(PHONE RlNGlNG)
Excuse me.
Yes.
Mr. Vice President.
Hello?
Yes.
Yes.
I understand.
Thank you.
(KNOCKlNG ON DOOR)
I was told I might meet
an old friend here.
GlNA: It's good to see you,
Gaius.
So you've become a member
of the peace movement?
Well, despite
what you may think,
I've always abhorred violence.
Would you excuse us, please?
Do they have any idea
what you are?
Of course not.
Even their dedication
has limits.
I've missed you.
You look amazing.
I can't believe
how real you are.
What are you doing?
I haven't stopped
thinking about you
since the second
I left the Pegasus.
No.
I can't get you
out of my head.
Don't do this now.
Not yet.
I can't help myself.
I can't.
Gaius.
(GRUNTlNG)
I'm sorry.
No.
I'm sorry. I'm just...
I'm not ready.
So is there any reason
in particular
for inviting me around here?
Because you saved me.
Let me save you.
Here we go again.
What are you talking about?
You must sense it.
Gaius, the fleet's crumbling.
People are turning
on each other.
There are serious misgivings
about the military.
When you're President,
you can use the office
to turn them against Adama,
paving the way
for the Cylons to save us.
I would love to be with you
always, but...
I know it's hard,
but it's the only way.
No.
No.
I am not who you think I am,
and I will not be responsible
for the destruction
of mankind.
If we would have caught it
sooner,
maybe we could have done more.
ADAR: Laura.
I didn't like the way
we left things this morning.
Richard...
I know.
You've been thinking
this is a mistake
for a while now.
I just met with Stans.
The Education Alliance
is going to back off.
Back off?
Laura, what did you give them?
I made them a promise
that we would seriously
hear out their grievances,
Richard.
I thought you'd be happy
they're going back to work.
Laura,
you've put me
in a very awkward position.
I don't see how.
Both sides gave ground.
It's not just
about your teachers.
It's the next strike
I'm worried about.
You just showed them
that if they hold out
long enough,
this administration will cave.
You expected me to fail.
I expected you
to hold the line.
This doesn't have to be
the end of the world.
You can stay on
in an advisory capacity.
Gods know we need your ideas.
You're asking me to resign?
I don't have any choice.
This isn't about
you and me anymore.
You're right, it's not.
You were willing
to attack those people,
and up until a few hours ago,
I was prepared to let you.
I am on my way
to the Galactica to
represent this administration.
When I return,
if you still want my job,
be prepared to fight.
When I return,
if you still want my job,
be prepared to fight.
Notify the Admiral.
(FLATLlNlNG)
This is Admiral Adama.
As you know, President Roslin
has been aboard Galactica
for the last few days.
She's a fighter.
But as of this moment,
her prognosis is grave.
I know that many of you
believe in
the power of prayer.
If that is your way,
then I urge you
to pray for our President.
As for the others,
I hope you will join me
in keeping her
in our thoughts.
Admiral, please don't do this.
Stand down, everyone.
Give me room.
Think about what you're doing,
Helo.
You're a soldier.
I'm a father, like you.
Please, sir,
give me a Raptor.
Let me take her off the ship.
I'll get her away
from the fleet.
I can't do that, son.
BALTAR: Admiral! Admiral!
Admiral!
Doctor, get the hell
out of here!
I must talk to you
concerning the Cylon child.
It seems I may have been
wrong,
very wrong,
when I said that
Dr. Cottle misinterpreted
the fetal blood work.
BALTAR: You see,
I had another look
at those samples
and I discovered something
quite intriguing.
Understand, Cylon blood
is virtually impossible
to differentiate from our own.
That being said,
obviously it has to be
slightly different
because the Cylon
is not human.
If our blood
Iooks like this,
for example,
and the Cylon's blood
looks like this,
then it's fair to assume
that the Cylon-human
is carrying an amalgam.
Is this a theory or fact?
The Cylon's fetus
contains no antigens,
it has no blood type.
That's what Dr. Cottle
was talking about when he said
it was damned odd.
Except it's not damned odd,
it's astonishing.
Now, knowing, as we do,
that the Cylons are built
slightly better to endure
than their human counterparts,
I wondered, could the Cylon
blood also be blessed,
shall we say blessed,
with a heightened resistance
to disease?
So
I applied a sample
of Sharon's fetal blood
to some cancer cells
I took from the President.
What am I looking at?
Nothing.
That's the whole point.
The cancer was gone
and it was gone
within a matter of hours.
Are you saying
you've found a cure
for the President's cancer?
Well, it's untried.
It's obviously untried
and therefore
extremely dangerous.
But, yes,
it's possible.
If you abort
Sharon's fetus now,
you'll never know.
Now, you may feel
a sharp pain.
Sharon, it's okay.
It's gonna be all right.
I don't like
what you're doing.
I think it's unnatural
and damned dangerous.
Yes, well,
given the patient's
current condition,
I am not sure
that I see the downside.
Maybe it's just her time.
Then for once
perhaps I am
the beacon of hope
around here.
It's all right.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm right here with you,
Sharon.
If you wanna settle this,
your people have to disengage.
No more civil disobedience,
no more acts of violence.
I want our students
back in school.
Done.
I'm glad you called,
Madam Secretary.
Me, too.
DOCTOR: I'm afraid the tests
are positive.
The mass is malignant.
(RAPlD BEEPlNG)
BlLLY: What's happening?
(ALL CLAMORlNG)
She's convulsing!
Nurse, get me 10cc's of...
COTTLE: Help me get her
on her side.
(GASPlNG)
Nurse! Nurse!
(ROSLlN GASPlNG)
(CARDlOGRAPH FLATLlNlNG)
No, hold it.
(RHYTHMlC BEEPlNG)
I'll be damned.
BALTAR: Madam President?
Dr. Baltar.
It's so very good to see you.
No, no, no. Don't. Don't move.
Don't move.
(ROSLlN GRUNTlNG)
BlLLY: Madam President.
How's she doing, Doctor?
I've never seen
anything like it.
It'll be a while before
she's 100%,
but the scans are clear.
The cancer's gone.
Are you sure?
It's gone.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Admiral.
You seem better.
Much.
Are you still
holding the spokesman
from the new faction
in the brig?
Yes.
Would you take me to him,
please?
Certainly.
Thank you.
I'll wait for you
to get dressed.
JAHEE: President Roslin.
Mr. Jahee, isn't it?
I thought it was time
we met.
Would you open the door,
please?
Do it.
All these people want
is to be heard.
A member of your group
nearly destroyed
our Tylium refinery.
Before we can even
begin to talk,
I need your personal assurance
that there will be
no more attacks.
As I told the Admiral,
I've had no direct contact
with anyone.
Genuine negotiations
require trust.
Do not lie to me.
I'll talk to my people.
Make them understand.
Excellent.
Then I'll listen,
maybe even act.
But if you renege,
I'll insist the Admiral
hunt you and your friends down
without mercy.
NO. 6:
You seem very content.
Sharon's child is safe.
Adama and Roslin have agreed
that more study
is required before any
drastic measures are taken.
Yes, but by saving Roslin,
you've denied yourself
your rightful place
of leadership.
There are many aspects
of you, Gaius,
I will never understand.
You wouldn't.
And neither, would I suspect,
your corporeal counterpart.
Do you love her?
What is that?
The note
that Roslin wrote me.
To be opened
upon the event of her death.
"President Baltar,
I offer my sincere
congratulations.
"l say that knowing
we've had our differences
"and that you take office
despite my many reservations.
"You may be
the most brilliant person
I've ever met,
"but your intelligence
is unleavened by compassion.
"You must be reminded of
your ethical responsibilities
"and challenged
to rise above
your own selfish needs.
"l don't write this
to hurt you, but to beg you
to open your heart.
"Understand that
the people in the fleet
look to you
"not only for leadership
but for solace.
"Justice.
"Find a way
to give them that,
"and you will be
a great leader.
"Laura Roslin."
BALTAR: And after all
I've done for the fleet.
And after all
I've done for her.
Roslin's never trusted you.
She's undermined you
at every turn, and now...
So now we know
she's never gonna trust me.
This is not
a political struggle anymore,
Gaius.
This is quite literally
life and death.
(DOOR OPENlNG)
The President assured me
that as long as there are
no further acts of violence,
she's willing
to bring our concerns
to the Quorum
and Admiral Adama.
She's trying to buy time.
She'll never be open
to negotiating
with the Cylons.
I disagree.
I think we made
real progress today
and so does
the Vice-President.
Baltar?
Yes.
Just before I left,
he asked to meet with me.
He encouraged patience
while he works with Roslin
from within,
and he offered
the contents of this case
as proof of his sincerity.
What's in it?
I don't know.
He said
that you should be the one
to open it.
NARRATOR: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.
ADAMA: Col. Fisk is the new
Pegasus Commander.
The Cylon's fetus
contains no antigens.
It makes it
a universal donor.
ADAMA: Are you saying
you've found a cure
for the President's cancer?
BALTAR: Yes.
ROSLlN: I've got ships
on half-rations.
When will
some of these supplies
start getting out
to the fleet?
The target's FTL is history.
She's all yours.
(PANTlNG)
RACETRACK: He's all right!
RACETRACK: I say again,
Apollo is all right.
Let's just be glad
that we both came back
alive, all right?
That's just it, Kara.
I didn't want to
make it back alive.
You're not gonna shoot.
You're not like me.
APOLLO: Hey, hey.
Hey, don't go.
Sorry. I thought
you were still asleep.
You should have
kicked me out of bed
an hour ago.
If I hold up
Galactica's Raptor,
Tigh'll have my ass.
(CHUCKLES)
Which, we both know,
currently belongs to me.
All right, let's move on
to the next item.
Oh, no, gentlemen, please,
don't get up.
After the last few weeks,
it just feels good
to be on my feet.
Thank you, though.
You've made
a remarkable recovery,
Madam President.
Remarkable indeed.
But now I'm playing catch-up.
I'm afraid during my illness
I lost focus.
I let some things slide.
Well, that's behind us now.
Yes, it is. To the point.
Supplies are running low
and the people are worried.
FlSK: Well, they wouldn't
be civilians
if they didn't have
something to bitch about.
ROSLlN: Well, I think
that in this case,
they're entitled.
Our inventory levels
are tight,
but they're not critical.
But all the way
across the fleet,
people are reporting
shortages of essential goods,
and what they do get
comes at a high price.
They're turning
to the black market.
Last week, one of my aides
came down with pneumonia.
Billy had to trade liquor
to get the antibiotics.
It's the nature of the beast.
People want what they want.
A few trades would be
one thing, Commander Fisk.
That's reality.
But I'm talking
about criminals
making outrageous demands
on the people.
So, bottom line is,
I'm implementing a new,
fleet-wide trade policy.
We need to be in control
of our supply chain,
not black market thugs.
I am hoping that I can have
the military's support
on this.
Admiral, if you want Pegasus
to run these dogs down,
you just give us the word.
Our people will do
whatever it takes
to get this under control.
And it's good
to have you back,
Madam President.
It's good to be back.
Thank you, Admiral.
Gentlemen, thank you.
(DOOR CLOSlNG)
FlSK: Is Madam President
always so right-in-your-face?
Her last-minute resurrection
seems to have
invigorated her somewhat.
Yeah, well,
maybe too much.
She doesn't really think
her made-up plans
and regulations
are gonna change anything,
does she?
As if we don't have
enough to do.
No, Madam President
sets a great prestige
by her office
and Adama supports her,
at least for the moment.
Well, then, so do l,
just for the moment.
By the way,
did you get the cigars
I had sent over?
I not only got them,
I enjoyed them as well.
Well, my pleasure,
Mr. Vice President.
Well, I've got
a ship to run.
I look forward
to our next visit.
As do l.
SHEVON: I got them
from a friend.
(DOOR OPENlNG)
APOLLO: Paya.
SHEVON: Hey, sweetie.
Wow. You seem to get
an inch taller
every time I see you.
What, I don't get
my handshake?
Well, that's okay, Paya.
I have a special surprise
for you, and it's in here.
APOLLO: You wanna come see?
SHEVON: What's he got? Go on.
(BAG UNZlPPlNG)
APOLLO: What have we got?
(GASPS)
Oh, Paya.
I've never been great
with kids.
Maybe next time
I'll get one with two eyes.
I'll see if I can trade it
for something else.
No, it's okay.
You just surprised her.
Well...
Well, look, I'm not sure
when I'll be able
to make it back.
I know.
I'm gonna have to ask
for an extra hundred
since you spent the night.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(LlGHTER CLlNKlNG)
Well, I wondered when
you were gonna show up.
(FlSK GAGGlNG)
LANDlNG OFFlCER: (ON RADlO)
Raptor one-two-niner,
you are cleared
into the break.
(PANTlNG)
RACETRACK: Galactica,
Raptor one-two-niner
has the ball.
Inbound speed 220.
Admiral, Colonel,
I'm just getting started,
but from the looks of him,
I'd say he was garroted.
Gods. This is
the last thing we needed.
Admiral, you might want
to take a look at this.
Looks like our friend Fisk
hit the jackpot.
Cubit?
If you find anything else,
let me know right away.
If I find anything else,
I may retire early.
ADAMA: Someone's
sending us a message.
Or running us
in circles.
Maybe there's another Cylon
in the fleet.
I'd almost prefer that
to the alternative:
we start killing our own.
All they have to do
is sit back and watch.
Fisk?
Do we have any idea
who did it?
No.
But we will do
a full investigation
and I want you to lead it.
Don't you think
it would be better
if someone from Pegasus
dealt with this?
Even though Cain's gone,
her influence lingers.
I need someone I can trust.
You know, there were times
when that was in short supply
between us.
We've both been through
an awful lot, Son.
And I hope that
we've grown stronger for it.
I need your help.
I'll call up a flight
to Pegasus right away.
Anyone else been inside?
Just the medical team, sir.
BALTAR: Do you know who I am?
I am the Vice President
of the Colonies. Let me in.
Captain Adama.
Commander Fisk didn't tell me
you were invited.
Let him in.
They were going to let me in.
BALTAR: Oh, my gods.
What's going on in here?
Where's Fisk?
On a slab
in Galactica's morgue.
What, he's dead?
Isn't this your brand?
NO. 6: Careful, Gaius.
You bought yourself
some goodwill
by saving Roslin,
but it's fading.
Their old suspicions
are reemerging.
What are you
doing here?
Captain?
I was about to ask you
the same thing.
Wait a minute, l...
Are you interrogating me?
I'm not sure
I appreciate your tone.
This isn't
a diplomatic exercise.
A man was butchered.
APOLLO: His head
was practically severed
from his body with piano wire.
NO. 6: You're Vice President
of the fleet.
Why are you acting
like a child with your hand
in the cookie jar, hmm?
Wonder what she would say
if she saw you like this.
You know, I can't believe
it's even necessary for me
to explain myself to you,
but obviously, no,
I had nothing to do
with Commander Fisk's death.
For the record,
I just came here to discuss
President Roslin's
new trade policy.
Well, I thought
that was settled.
No, Commander Fisk
had some reservations.
I'll bet.
And as the Vice President,
I decided
to assuage his doubts
of my own free will.
Is that sufficient?
Or would you like me to
provide you with an alibi?
I'm sure
I can rustle one up.
Enjoy the cigars.
APOLLO: Escort
the Vice President
to his ship.
(MACHlNES HUMMlNG)
The wireless is going crazy.
Word of Fisk's murder
has spread out
through the entire fleet.
When we lose
a command officer
aboard a warship,
people are gonna be concerned
about their security.
TlGH: A crew can fall apart
when their commander's killed.
Pegasus lost two
in a matter of weeks.
Maybe this time
they were lucky.
His personal log shows
that he was rerouting
supply runs,
on and offloading freighters
without command authorization.
APOLLO: He raided
the MacConnel
and at least
a dozen other ships
in the last week.
I found a small warehouse
of high-value merchandise
in his quarters.
He was working
the black market.
Half the fleet's working it.
Fisk was getting greedy.
If he crossed
one of his suppliers
on a deal,
that would explain
the cubits that Cottle found.
It still doesn't tell us
who did it.
Well, he's gonna need
trading partners.
And they wouldn't be
hard to find,
even on Galactica.
WORKER 1: All right,
let's open it up here.
WORKER 2: Move around back.
(PAYA COUGHlNG)
Lee, I'm scared.
Paya's cough
keeps getting worse.
I'll bring her something
on my next trip.
Which could be weeks
if there's another
Cylon attack.
I keep hearing about
shortages on the other ships,
people trading
anything they can
for food, and for medicine.
Really?
Have you seen all the new
working girls outside?
Lee, when your baby's crying
because it's hungry,
you'll do anything
to make it stop.
Hey.
Come here.
PAYA: Mommy.
(KNOCKlNG ON DOOR)
Captain.
What do you want?
APOLLO: Is your wife around,
Colonel?
No. Why?
Is this hers?
Yeah. She lost it
a couple weeks ago.
Where the hell
did you find it?
On Pegasus.
In Commander Fisk's quarters.
(COUGHlNG)
She's burning up.
APOLLO: What did they say
at the infirmary?
Antibiotics have all
been rationed out.
They said
they might have something
by the end of the week.
(PAYA COUGHlNG)
We got shortages
across the fleet,
people begging for scraps,
but somehow you and Mrs. Tigh
have fresh fruit,
real liquor...
All right. What the hell
is this about?
You must have known
she was trading with Fisk.
Well, maybe I'll talk to her.
She didn't give it to Fisk.
I did. I traded it
for a few necessities,
a couple of things
to help her get by.
Big frakking deal.
There's nothing illegal
about that.
Not yet.
Don't you play
holier-than-thou with me.
I haven't done anything
that most people on this ship
haven't done.
Including you.
Doesn't make us right,
Colonel,
just a whole lot
of people wrong.
(PANTlNG)
(GRUNTlNG)
You didn't make it
to class today.
(PANTlNG)
Yeah, I've been
pretty jammed up.
Anyway, I'm not sure
you need me
holding your hand anymore.
Was that what you were doing?
Holding my hand?
(CHUCKLES)
I meant it as a compliment.
Permission
to speak frankly, sir?
You don't need my permission
and you don't need the "sir."
Maybe that's the problem.
I don't really know
what to think anymore.
So I'll just ask.
Is this going somewhere?
Dee...
Please don't pretend
like you don't know
what I'm talking about.
You now, our...
Our time together,
our workouts.
Something's changed
between us.
I'm just not sure
what you want me to say.
Then don't say anything.
WOMAN: (ON P.A. SYSTEM)
Communications
paging Captain Adama.
You have a priority
ship-to-ship call
from Cloud 9.
Captain Adama here.
(BANGlNG ON DOOR)
APOLLO: Shevon.
Shevon, it's me!
Shevon?
Oh, my gods.
What did they do?
They said they knew
about you and me.
They wanted to know
what we've been talking about.
Lee, I don't understand
why they'd care.
All right, get what you need.
I'm taking you and Paya
back to Galactica.
(BAG RUSTLlNG)
Lee, wait.
It's the only place
I can keep you safe.
What are you gonna
tell them about us?
I'm not fooling myself.
I know what this is.
SHEVON: Lee!
(MAN GROANS)
(SCREAMlNG)
(SHEVON SCREAMS)
(GRUNTlNG)
Get away from us!
(CHOKlNG)
You listening?
I hear any more talk
about Fisk,
I'm going to send your whore
back to you piece by piece.
And then I'm gonna start
on the little girl.
I know who you are,
I know whose son you are.
And I don't care.
You tell Adama to let it go.
Is that when you knew
that you loved her?
I thought so.
SHEVON: But you hurt her.
(GRUNTlNG)
(GROANlNG)
This is Captain Adama.
I need a medic
and a security team
on L Deck asap.
You wanted to see me,
Madam President?
Yes.
Thank you for coming, Doctor.
Have a seat.
Would you like some tea?
I'd love one.
You know, I'm never quite sure
where we stand
with each other, Doctor.
Why do you think that is?
I can't imagine why.
I've never had anything
but the utmost respect
for you and your office.
I understand
that you and Commander Fisk
planned to meet
just prior to his death.
As I have already explained
to Captain Adama,
Commander Fisk
had several lingering concerns
about your new trade policy.
What can I say?
And that's it?
NO. 6: Gaius,
she's afraid of you.
Why
are you asking me this?
You saved my life
and I'm grateful.
But I sense that there is
some unease in you
about assuming the presidency
and I'd like
to offer you an out.
You what?
Resign.
Return to
your scientific work
on Galactica.
No one will question
your motives,
and you can consider it
a second chance
like the one you gave me.
Charming.
Doctor,
this is a one-time offer.
I suggest you reconsider.
You know, Madam President,
I've never been particularly
interested in politics
and I never wanted
any lofty position of power.
I never wanted to be
the Vice President.
That is,
until this very moment.
Because right now,
I can't think of anything
I want more.
One to the head.
You didn't do this?
I was attacked.
I found him there
when I woke up.
Security bulletin said
Commander Fisk
was garroted with a wire.
Whatever happened,
looks like you found your guy.
What about Shevon,
and her daughter?
Cloud 9's an open port.
Chances are
they're already off-ship.
I'll get a team down here.
Councilman Zarek.
Lee. I just heard.
Are you all right?
What are you doing here?
Attending a Quorum meeting.
Nothing as exciting
as all this, I assure you.
I know these places
are legal, but still,
the son of the almighty Adama?
Talk to me
about the black market.
(ZAREK CHUCKLES)
Not much to say.
It's widespread, inevitable,
and according to
President Roslin, illegal.
So it's no surprise
that you and Fisk
were in it up to your necks.
Fisk, maybe, but not me.
I represent Astral Queen.
Have to be careful
about the company I keep.
This is Fisk's log.
He says he made three runs
to Astral Queen
in the last 10 days
and I doubt it was to
discuss prison reform.
What do you want
from me, Captain?
Names of ships. Contacts.
I can't help you.
Why do you think
Fisk approached me?
To get a piece
of your black market scam.
To offer you protection.
You and your father are both
so blinded by the past.
Fisk's black market
was up and running
when he approached me.
He knew Adama would pick up
on his unauthorized shuttles,
so he tried to force me
into taking over
the deliveries,
creating a firewall
between Pegasus
and the illegal shipments.
So you're trying to tell me
that you turned him down?
At great cost.
Check the fleet logs,
see how many supply ships
made stops at the Astral Queen
after Fisk's last trip.
The answer is none.
So if Fisk was
trying to starve you out,
why didn't you bring it
to the Quorum?
Roslin's acting
like the black market's
some sort of aberration,
but I thought
you were smarter than that.
Did you really expect
some utopian fantasy
to rise from the ashes?
ZAREK: I heard
the security officer.
They gave you Fisk's killer
for a reason.
They're offering you
a way out.
You know something,
don't you?
Just rumors.
There's a freighter,
Prometheus.
Some people say
it's gone off the grid.
But if you want something
bad enough,
that's where you go.
The deals are brokered
by an ex-military mercenary
named Phelan.
Lee.
I hope she's worth it.
(ZAREK SlGHS)
(PEOPLE CHATTERlNG)
Hey, man, biotics. Here.
(PAYA COUGHlNG)
(CHlLDREN SOBBlNG)
Paya?
Paya! Paya! Hey, Paya.
Hey, it's okay.
It's Lee, do you remember?
It's Lee.
You're gonna be fine,
I promise you.
Okay, you just hang tight.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
(SlGHlNG)
(PEOPLE CHATTERlNG)
You may find this
hard to believe, but my father
was in the service, too.
Strict as hell,
probably the same
as your old man.
But when the Cylons attacked,
all his duty and honor
didn't add up to squat.
Is she dead?
I can see
why you want her back.
She's one of my best.
One of yours?
A good escort
understands it's about
a lot more than sex.
PHELAN: She knows
when to listen,
and when to call for help.
Lee, I had to.
PHELAN: Don't blame her.
The only reason you're alive
is because
I was able to see you
through Shevon's eyes.
And what I saw
seemed reasonable.
Like Fisk?
Fisk was a pig.
He tried to force us
to renegotiate.
So you killed him.
No. I gave you the killer,
the murder weapon, the prints,
everything you needed
to close the case
legitimately.
Despite
the President's objections,
the fleet needs us.
Rationing's too tight,
ship comes in too late,
we're the pressure valve.
We provide.
PHELAN: When Shevon
needed antibiotics,
she knew where to go.
Without us, people would have
nowhere to turn.
The fleet
would tear itself apart.
And what about
those children outside?
How are they
helping the fleet?
Everyone has needs.
Some settle for cigars
and liquor.
You wanted Shevon.
Others are more demanding.
It's hard to find
the moral high ground
when we're all standing
in the mud.
I'm not like
my old man, Captain.
And you are not like yours.
I came alone,
but Galactica tracked me
on dradis.
All they'll need to
vent this ship into space
is an excuse.
So let's make a deal.
I want Shevon, the girl,
I walk out of here
and you shut down
this operation.
And all of you will live.
Sorry, the little girl's
been paid for. No refunds.
Oh, gods. No!
PHELAN: Wait.
Lee, don't.
Come on. Do it. Do it.
I made you a fair offer.
(MAN CHOKlNG)
So did l.
APOLLO: Yeah,
you're probably right
about everything.
You, me, Fisk.
Nobody can stop it.
And maybe nobody should.
But it needs limits.
There's lines you can't cross
and you've crossed them.
You're not gonna shoot.
You're not like me.
You're not gonna...
(MUMBLlNG)
(GASPlNG)
APOLLO: All right, it's done.
The fleet relies
on the black market.
Much as we'd like,
we can't wish that away.
So you're still in business.
For now.
But if there are
any more killings,
if you hold back
essential medicines,
if you ever touch a child...
Shevon...
No, I don't want...
Hey, hey, it's over.
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay...
Lee, Lee, no.
Hey. Shevon, it's over.
Stop.
I can't be
what you want me to be.
I don't want you
to be anything.
You want me to be her.
(SNlFFLlNG)
That's what this is about.
That's what
this has always been about.
No. That's not what
this has ever been about.
Come on, Lee.
I know my job.
I'm a replacement.
For a lot of things.
Things that men
can't get anywhere else.
SHEVON: Things they've lost.
She wanted
to give you a child.
But you were afraid,
so you pushed her away
and then you ran,
and you didn't stop running
until it was too late.
Well, I'm not her.
And Paya is not,
and will never be,
your child.
APOLLO: Commander Fisk's
murder has been resolved
and Pegasus' crew
appears to have accepted
Galactica's conclusions.
That's all,
Madam President.
Not quite. What about
this ship Prometheus?
I understand it's the hub
of the fleet's black market.
We will keep an eye on them.
Keep an eye on them.
That's not exactly
the solution I had in mind.
Whether or not we allow
a criminal enterprise
to thrive in this fleet
is not a matter of choice,
Captain.
Admiral?
I've given Lee
full authority on this issue.
The decision is his.
I support your trade policies
wholeheartedly,
Madam President,
but we are never gonna have
a perfect system.
There will always be
some kind of black market.
At least this way
I know names, I know faces,
I know where they are
and we will monitor
the situation.
Thank you, gentlemen,
I'm busy.
(PEOPLE CHATTERlNG)
BlLLY: Eighteen. I'm starting
to sweat here. Nineteen...
You should be sweating.
Twenty...
Why aren't you doing
any of these?
No talking, no talking,
please.
No cheating.
Hold it up, a little higher.
(CHUCKLlNG)
Sneaky.
Eight, nine...
Start again.
You aren't serious.
Zero...
Well? No?
President wasn't
very happy today.
No.
Ever since you ejected
from the Blackbird,
you've been different.
Harder to reach.
I'm just trying to understand.
Well, like you said, Dad,
we've all been through a lot.
Fair enough.
But you should have told me
about the woman.
NARRATOR: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.
Frak me.
Are you alive?
BOOMER: It's probably
a Cylon itself.
More of an animal, maybe,
than the human models.
Maybe they genetically
design it to perform a task.
To be a fighter.
Why defend...
For no frakking reason!
Knock it off! Knock it off!
Get the hell
out of here now.
I am so sick of her.
What am I doing?
What am I doing?
No!
What the hell happened?
Kat's made the trap
a hundred times!
Let me go!
Give me those.
STARBUCK: What is this?
Oh, my God!
Stims.
And by the look of her
she's been taking them
by the handful.
I was burnt out.
I started taking stims.
I was so stupid.
As soon as I get back
to Galactica
I'll send a rescue party.
Yeah, right.
If I say I'm gonna
do something, I do it.
Count on it.
My kind of woman.
The Resistance Base Camp
is here.
Three hundred clicks north
of the only Cylon air base
in the area.
I respect what
you're trying to do here,
however...
We have a duty
to the people we left behind.
We understand that.
We have to find a way
to jump back to Caprica
and go get those...
Kara!
STARBUCK: (OVER RADlO)
Entering Sector 2-5-9.
Keep your eyes open, Kat.
This is where BB and Jo-Jo
bought it.
Come on out, Scar,
you ugly Cylon son of a bitch.
Let's party.
I don't think
he's going to RSVP, Kat.
He prefers surprise parties.
KAT: Yeah?
Well, he'll be surprised
when I blow his ass apart.
Yeah, that'll be the day.
Kassie. Kassie?
Wasn't that her name?
STARBUCK: Whose name?
Reilly's girlfriend.
You know, Kat, I told you
I have no frakking idea.
So give it a rest,
all right?
STARBUCK: Reilly's dead
for one very simple reason.
He couldn't control his fear.
KAT: Yeah, poor idiot
cut and ran.
Gave the toaster
a free shot up his ass.
Scar spooked him.
He saw
that motherfrakker's red eye
coming straight for him
and he panicked.
Reilly was a good stick.
A little short on guts,
but a good stick.
Beano had plenty.
Took Cally an hour
to clean out his cockpit.
Hey, does anybody
remember the name
of Reilly's girlfriend?
No.
Karen, I think.
Died on Picon. Karen?
No. Was it Kathy? Kathy?
You guys,
what does it matter?
Gonna hold
a little prayer circle,
good cry, the whole thing?
Actually, it does matter.
Hi.
Hey!
This is Ensign Baxton.
Ensign Clark.
And I guess
we're your new bunkmates.
Welcome.
We just finished
Viper training on Pegasus.
Ready to kick
some Cylon butt.
So was Beano.
Who's Beano?
Here.
Oh, Scar is gonna smoke you
like a fine cigar, my man.
Who's Scar?
DUCK: Not who, what.
The toasters' top gun.
Deadliest Raider
in the Cylon fleet.
Give me a break.
What, they're machines.
One's the same as the next.
Yeah, that's what we thought,
till Captain Thrace cut
the brain out of one.
HOTDOG: Scar's the best
they got.
Lot of pilots died
going after that bastard.
Why do they call him Scar?
Oh, you'll find out
soon enough.
He's got a taste for nuggets.
Easy pickings.
KAT: Whoa!
Hold up, Starbuck.
I think I got something.
The Big Spud. Lower rim.
You see that?
STARBUCK: Negative.
There was a time
you would have
noticed that before me.
Fine, you're the shooter.
KAT: You gotta keep up.
STARBUCK: Kat,
please, don't screw up.
So, how does Scar take out
an experienced pilot
like Beano?
He hides...
STARBUCK: He hides
behind an asteroid,
or the debris field
that you've ignored
because it looked like
a bunch of harmless rocks.
You see,
Scar doesn't like to fight
till the odds are on his side.
And then, suddenly,
out of nowhere, bam.
He pops out,
blows you to pieces.
And then jumps away
before you can return fire.
Well, if you ask me,
I think Scar's a coward.
(LAUGHlNG)
This isn't dueling pistols
at dawn, this is war.
You never wanna fight fair.
You wanna sneak up
behind your enemy
and club him
over the head.
You see,
Scar understands that.
And so do l.
So that's why
I'm gonna kill him.
You?
Starbuck,
you can barely walk.
Look who's talking.
Stim junkie.
ALL: Whoa.
You know, I wouldn't be
calling anybody a junkie
if I were you, Starbuck.
Not with the way
you've been pounding back
that booze lately.
One Tigh on this ship's
enough.
Well, I got...
I got 200 here,
says I nail Scar's
chrome-plated ass.
And when I do,
you hand that top gun
over to me
and pour me my first drink.
PlLOT 1: All right, Kat!
Your lips will never
touch the rim, little girl.
(PlLOTS CHANTlNG)
Starbuck! Starbuck!
We'll see.
Starbuck! Starbuck!
PlLOT 1: You're no better!
PlLOT 2: STARBUCK!
(ALL YELLlNG)
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Maybe you should slow down.
Maybe.
(ALL CHANTlNG)
Starbuck! Starbuck!
Maybe not.
Starbuck! Starbuck!
Starbuck! Starbuck!
Starbuck! Starbuck!
Starbuck! Starbuck!
Starbuck!
Coming in hot.
Check your speed!
Speed, 250!
(GLASS SHATTERlNG)
(ALL EXCLAlMlNG)
Oh, yeah,
it's got to be Scar.
Found your hiding place,
you little frakker.
Starbuck,
kiss your 200 goodbye!
This guy's mine!
STARBUCK: Something's
definitely wrong.
That can't be Scar.
He should be jumping
or wheeling a gun at us.
I'll check our tails.
Frak!
(ALARM BLARlNG)
Frak! I'm hit!
KAT: Starbuck!
I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit!
KAT: See, Beano opened fire
too early.
You guys,
you've gotta
fill the windscreen
with the sucker
or you're not going
to hit him.
See, look.
He's still not close enough.
Beano's already dead.
He just doesn't know it yet.
Do any of you guys see
where he went wrong?
There, you see that glint?
There.
That's a Raider.
If Beano hadn't fixated
on his target,
he'd have seen that.
BB: Was it Scar?
There he is,
boys and girls.
There's the motherfrakker
I'm gonna kill.
I'm afraid this is
one of those "good news,
bad news" conversations.
Bad news first.
The mining ship's broken
another drill bit.
We need to extend again.
Another eight days.
Eight more days.
Son of a bitch.
They've just discovered
an incredibly rich vein
of ore.
Enough to build two entire
squadrons of Vipers.
I can't walk away from that.
What's the good news?
The Pegasus production team
has just turned out
its first combat-ready Viper.
We are beginning
to replace our losses.
Are they gonna be able
to replace pilots as well?
STARBUCK: Let's review
the tactical situation.
Four weeks ago,
our mining ship
struck pay dirt
on this asteroid.
A pile of strategic metals
that we need
to build new ships.
Since we're sitting ducks
until the miners
finish the job,
the old man has sent the Fleet
out of harm's way
under the protection
of Pegasus.
Our job is to stay behind
and protect the miners.
Unfortunately,
this star system
is full of rocks and dust.
Dradis cannot tell the rocks
from the bad guys,
so our only reliable system
of detection is...
Our eyeballs.
Which means we have
to put those eyeballs
way out there.
Split up,
cover a huge perimeter.
We'll be patrolling the area
in divisions of four
at these picket points.
Twos. We're going
in sections of twos.
Are you planning the ops
for me now, too?
(SlGHS)
(PlLOTS MURMURlNG)
CAG wants us to spread out
to control a larger area.
It's right here
in the briefings.
(STARBUCK CLEARS THROAT)
You're right.
So we do go in twos.
PlLOT: (WHlSPERlNG) Great.
You ask her to spread out...
Scar and his buddies
are out there,
looking for easy kills.
Let's not give them any.
This operation is vital
to the long-term survival
of this Fleet.
ADAMA: Yes, it is.
And we'll continue
to support it.
They're grinding us down
Viper by Viper.
Why have they stopped
coming at us en masse?
Is it because
we destroyed their
Resurrection ship?
Starbuck's working on that.
BOOMER: You know,
Scar has probably died
and been reborn
a dozen times.
You may have
faced him before.
So what,
Raiders reincarnate,
just like you?
Yeah. Just like me.
Great.
What a frakking world.
A Raider's much like
a trained animal,
with basic consciousness
and survival instinct.
You know,
but with the destruction
of the Resurrection ship,
when they die,
they're really dead.
So, they're not gonna
mount mass attacks
where they could have
major casualties.
Raiders reincarnate.
Makes sense, doesn't it?
It takes months for you
to train a nugget
into an effective Viper pilot.
And then they get killed
and then you lose
your experience,
their knowledge,
their skill sets,
it's gone forever.
So, if you could
bring them back and put them
in a brand new body,
wouldn't you do it?
'Cause death then becomes
a learning experience.
How... How many pilots
have we lost?
I mean, have you lost?
You know, there are times
when I look at you
and I forget
what you are.
All I see is
that kid
that spooched her landings
day after day.
The kid that was
frakking the Chief
and thinking she was
getting away with it.
Yeah, I remember.
You were
like a big sister.
Kara,
be careful of Scar, okay?
He's filled with rage.
About what?
Dying's a painful
and traumatic experience.
Every time he's reborn,
he's filled with
more bitter memories.
Scar hates you every bit
as much as you hate him.
STARBUCK: A Raider is
a squirmy son of a bitch.
You won't be able to
keep him in your sights
for more than two seconds,
so you have to deliver
a killing burst
within that time,
or he will turn
and nail you.
All that yanking and banking
gives you one hell
of a case of vertigo.
And that is what
this chair simulates.
KAT: All right, Jo-Jo!
DUCK: Come on.
KAT: Come on, Jo-Jo.
BB: Come on, Jo-Jo.
Let's go.
DUCK: He's not looking
too great.
Hang in there.
Come on.
KAT: Hit him, hit him.
Tough stuff.
Go!
(ALL SHOUTlNG)
Hey, hey, hey.
BB: Jo-Jo, up, up, up!
Time!
(BUZZER SOUNDlNG)
Not bad.
At least he hit the target.
Well, that's a lot better
than I did the first time.
I think I took out
that clock over there.
So, what's the
all-time record?
HOTDOG: Four hits
on the X-ring.
Are you kidding?
Who did that?
I did.
Mind if I give it a shot,
for old times' sake?
Be my guest.
DUCK: Yeah.
KARA: Yeah.
Come on, now, Kat.
Two seconds.
DUCK: Go, Kat. Come on, Kat!
WOMAN: Go, Kat. Get him!
STARBUCK: Time!
(BUZZER SOUNDlNG)
Five.
Yes!
ALL: Whoa! All right!
Way to go!
(BULLETS ZlPPlNG)
Frak! I'm hit! I'm hit!
KAT: Starbuck!
I'm hit, I'm hit,
I'm hit! Kat.
Starbuck,
where the hell are you?
Starbuck,
I lost visual on you.
Starbuck,
what's your position?
STARBUCK: Primary
and secondary hydraulics
are bent.
I can deal with it!
Starbuck, I got no visual
on you! Where you at?
Forget it, Kat.
Scar is mine.
KAT: Don't be an idiot,
Starbuck!
What's your position?
STARBUCK: Yeah,
you remember me, don't you?
You want my ass so bad
you can taste it.
Well, keep coming!
'Cause I guaran-frakking-tee
you I will put you down
this time, for good!
(GRUNTlNG)
One more.
HELO: Come on, Starbuck,
let's go. Get it up.
(GRUNTlNG)
Why are you pushing so hard?
Kat's just
another hotshot kid
out to make her bones.
Like you were
before you met Anders.
You ever think about him?
What's the point?
He's dead.
Kara,
if you didn't think he had
a chance of surviving,
why'd you promise to return
with a rescue party?
(PANTlNG) I thought I was...
I don't know what I thought.
Captain Thrace,
if Scar jumps us out there...
Keep your eyes open
so he can't.
But if I screw up
and he bushwhacks me,
what do I do then?
Come on.
They drilled this into you
over and over and over again
at basic air combat.
I know, sir, but Scar
is something I'm not...
Scar is no different
than any other attacker.
If he comes at you,
turn into him.
Get closer, pull the trigger.
Into him. Get closer.
Pull the trigger.
Thank you, sir.
Don't run, or you'll die.
Right.
What are you waiting for?
(SlGHS)
Nothing, sir.
Come here.
Come here,
I wanna talk to you.
KAT: Now listen to me.
You're flying
Duck's wing today,
Baxton, right?
Yes. Call sign BB,
sir.
Okay, Duck's one
of our best pilots
that we got.
Okay, so just do
what he says,
and you'll be fine.
Just don't let the Raiders
get anywhere near the miners.
Okay.
Yeah.
Thank you, sir.
Go get them, Tiger.
Starbuck.
That kid needs more
than a pat on the ass
and a textbook quote
about tactics, okay?
You wanna be the wet-nurse,
go right ahead, all right.
Be my guest.
His jacket says
he's a qualified
Viper jock,
so I either fly him
or I ground him
and then we go up short.
What's it gonna be?
Your call, Kat.
STARBUCK: Galactica, Starbuck.
Wilco return to base.
DUALLA:
Roger that, Starbuck.
DUCK: BB, Duck.
Four Raiders
from behind the rock
at left ten, coming hard.
Looks like Scar.
BB: Duck, BB,
what do we do?
We don't have
enough fuel to mix it up.
We bug out, BB.
Let our relief
deal with them.
We're going home.
BB: Negative.
Starbuck said to turn into
any attack. Weapons hot.
You're bingo fuel.
Don't attack, you idiot.
DUCK: Gods damn it, BB,
this is
the frakking exception.
Abort and reform!
STARBUCK: Duck, Starbuck.
Position?
Four-two alpha,
behind the Big Spud.
We need a hand,
right frakking now.
You're on your own, Duck.
Everybody's way out of range.
STARBUCK: Duck,
be there in six minutes.
KAT: Duck, Kat.
Eight minutes, out.
BB: Duck,
they're on my six!
Oh, my Gods.
(YELLlNG) Duck!
It's all right, Jo-Jo.
MAN: Verify PC-2
pressure zero,
throttles closed,
oxygen generator
and master switches off.
Check.
Shutdown complete.
Nothing you could do,
Captain.
Too far away.
KAT: Nice work, Starbuck.
What the hell happened to BB?
What happened?
He did exactly
what you told him
to do, Captain.
Him and Duck had bingo fuel
and a head start home,
but instead, that FNG
turned and attacked.
Scar lit him up
like a pinwheel.
Why'd he try to
take on Scar by himself?
Stupid idiot.
"Try to run
and you're dead."
I heard you.
You drilled that into
that poor moron's head.
You know what?
You and I both know that
99% of the time
that is the right move.
Not this time.
APOLLO: You know
what gets me?
I know that in two weeks
I won't remember his face.
I can't remember
any of their faces
after they're killed.
No matter
how hard I try,
they just fade.
I don't even remember
their names.
The names.
Well, let's see,
there was Flattop,
who bought it on
his thousandth landing.
There was Chuckles.
(LAUGHlNG)
Stop it, all right?
Please,
it's not funny.
All right.
It's not funny.
It is funny.
You know, the President says
that we're saving humanity
for a bright, shiny future
on Earth
that you and I are
never gonna see.
We're not.
Because we go out
over and over again,
until some day,
some metal motherfrakker
is gonna catch us on a bad day
and just blow us away.
Bright, shiny futures
are overrated, anyway.
That's why
we got to get what we can
right now.
I'll drink to that.
To right now.
So why don't we?
Why don't we what?
Hey, wait a minute.
What?
Wait a minute.
Ow! Hey, slow down.
Whoa. This isn't a race.
Kara, what's going on?
What's going on?
What's wrong with you?
All right?
Okay, you know what?
I don't wanna know.
I don't wanna know.
Hey! What about us?
There is no "us".
All right?
I just wanted a good lay.
There is nothing here.
Do you get that?
Nothing!
Sure.
My Gods!
Hey.
Well, that's just great.
Frak or fight, huh?
Okay, maybe I am
just a quick lay,
but, Kara,
I'm also your friend.
I am hung up
on a dead guy, okay?
And it is pissing me off.
And I don't know
what I'm doing.
Anders, right? On Caprica.
The resistance fighter.
Yeah, well, Samuel's dead,
so what does it matter?
Oh, Kara, please,
for once in your life...
I don't need your pity, Lee.
You haven't got my pity!
Listen, you are fine.
You are fine
with the dead guys.
It's the living ones
you can't deal with.
(SlGHS)
There you are.
I got visual on you,
Starbuck.
I'm inbound
about 15 out.
Now!
STARBUCK: All right, Scar,
let's see how much
you like playing chicken
when you can't downward,
you bitch.
(GUN FlRlNG)
How's it feel, you bastard?
One of us is gonna
have to break away first
and it isn't gonna be me.
KAT: Starbuck, wake up!
He's a machine!
He's not gonna break!
You're committing suicide,
Starbuck!
In two-on-two engagements,
Cylon Raiders like to isolate
individual Vipers,
and then gang up on one,
hoping to kill it
before his wingman
has a chance to protect him.
MAN: Captain.
Which is exactly what happened
to Jo-Jo 20 minutes ago.
KAT: Oh, no.
DUCK: Frak me.
Was it Scar?
The bastard smoked Jo-Jo
and jumped away
in less than 15 seconds
before his wingman
could get a shot off.
And where were you?
What?
Flight schedule had you
flying lead for Jo-Jo
on that patrol, so,
why'd you assign Snake
to take your place?
Was it too early
in the morning for you,
Starbuck?
What exactly
are you trying to say,
Lieutenant?
What I'm trying to say,
Captain,
is maybe if you weren't up
all night drinking,
Jo-Jo would have
still been here.
PlLOT: (WHlSPERlNG)
Shut up.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Give us the room.
(ALL MURMURlNG)
What is it
with you, Katraine?
Ever since I got back,
you have been on my ass
like a bad rash.
You know, coming in late
for a briefing
'cause you're hung over,
that's bad enough,
but when you back out
on a mission...
I put Snake in my place
because I was in no condition
to fly and I knew that.
You see, unlike you,
I don't take a bunch of pills
and then climb
in my cockpit so wired
that I can't land
the frakking ship.
Starbuck,
you're an embarrassment.
You used to be
the hottest stick
on the Fleet.
Now,
you're just a reckless drunk
who sends other people out
to get killed.
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
Are you going to hit me,
Starbuck?
It scares you, doesn't it?
Actually, no.
You're afraid
most of the time, Kat.
You're afraid that
you're going to end up
Iike that picture
of Reilly's girlfriend.
Some little
forgotten picture
that nobody really remembers.
You see, that's why
you're riding my ass so hard.
So no one will notice
that Scar
scares the living crap
out of you.
(GRUNTS)
Ten-hut!
What's going on?
A little tactical
discussion, sir.
Well, it must have
been lively.
All right,
I'm pairing you two up.
Kat, I want you to fly
Starbuck's wing
out by the Big Spud.
Sir, l...
I got a hunch a couple Raiders
are gonna try and sneak
through that sector,
so I want my heavy hitters
out there to greet them.
Skids up in 49 minutes.
Sir.
Starbuck.
Are you okay?
STARBUCK: (OVER RADlO)
Entering Sector 2-5-9.
Keep your eyes open, Kat.
This is where BB and Jo-Jo
bought it.
Kassie. Kassie?
Maybe that was her name?
You know, Kat, I told you
I have no frakking idea.
So give it a rest,
all right?
KAT: Whoa, hold up, Starbuck.
You see that?
Oh, yeah, it's got to be Scar.
STARBUCK: Something's
definitely wrong.
That can't be Scar.
Frak! I'm hit!
KAT: Starbuck!
STARBUCK:
I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit!
Don't be an idiot, Starbuck!
What's your position?
STARBUCK: Yeah,
you remember me, don't you?
There you are.
I got visual on you, Starbuck.
I'm inbound
about 15 out.
STARBUCK: All right, Scar,
let's see how much
you like playing chicken
when you can't downward,
you bitch.
How's it feel, you bastard?
One of us is gonna
have to break away first
and it isn't going to be me.
Starbuck, I'm inbound
your starboard...
Starbuck, wake up!
KAT: He's a machine!

Just needed

So why didn't you do it?
I probably would have
died in the process.
The bastard was too good.
A couple months ago,
I wouldn't even have
thought about that.
Would have just gone
for the glory,
hoping I could pull it out
of the fire somehow.
Don't be kicking yourself.
You did the right thing
and called in your wingman,
okay?
Scar's dead. You and Kat
came back alive.
That's not
why I did it, though.
I can't get Anders

I've asked you here

It's what you said

That humanity

And that people still
kill one another

You said that humanity

REPORTER: Speculation
continues that Galactica
is harboring a Cylon agent.
Eyewitnesses claim
to have seen one of
the known Cylon models
moving in and out
of Galactica's brig.
Admiral Adama
has made no comment
on this situation.
We will continue...
How the hell did this
get out to the press?
ROSLlN: I'm surprised
it didn't happen sooner.
I'm told you've been
meeting with her regularly,
allowing her to interact
with members of your crew.
She's a military asset
providing us with
vital strategic intelligence.
While we pray that
she's not somehow
colluding with other Cylons.
If I felt for one second
that she posed some kind
of a threat to this Fleet,
I'd pull the trigger
on her myself.
I think the Fleet
may need to hear that,
Admiral.
Even more,
they need to believe it.
Someone took their vitamin
this morning.
Yeah, I don't know
what got into me.
No, you're right.
Keeping Sharon Valerii alive,
allowing her pregnancy
to continue,
there is no road map
for any of this.
Somebody, somebody
has got to keep asking
the hard questions.
I agree.
I want to stay ahead of this.
Acknowledge
the Cylon's existence
and then make
some kind of case for her
to stay aboard Galactica.
I don't think
that's going to work.
What? Why?
I think you need
to trust the people.
Use the press,
tell them the truth.
I mean,
we barely know anything
about the Cylons,
and until we learn more,
we're not gonna destroy
the only source
of information
that we have. Period.
Good. That simple, huh?
Well...
Could l...
Could I have a minute?
Sure. Important?
You were saying
about the hard questions.
I know it's just
my Debate Team ring,
but it's the best I could do.
This really isn't
how I planned it.
Anyway...
Billy...
I love you.
I've loved you
since the first day
I met you.
I mean, you were
half-naked, granted.
I know that I kind of
blind-sided you with this,
okay?
I mean, it doesn't
have to be tomorrow.
We can take our time.
Billy, I can't marry you.
I don't know
how else to say it.
I'm sorry.
He pulled out that ring
and it was like
an electric shock.
I could barely say anything.
Well, maybe you're regretting
that you didn't say yes.
No. No.
I don't know what to make
of me and Billy,
but I know
I can't marry him.
Then again,
I don't know what to make
of you and me, either.
(BOTH GASPlNG)
Excuse me.
Yeah, sure thing.
Hey, two more.
Coming right up.
Ellen.
It's good to see you.

Billy.
Didn't know you were
coming down here.
I grabbed

I thought I'd grab
some R and R.
I'm on business, as usual.
Captain Adama.
Oh, I really am an idiot,
aren't l?
No, Billy...
Don't.
Don't bother.
Can you give us a minute?
No, you know what?
Have a seat, Captain.
Be my guest.
Billy, I'm sorry.
I thought, if anything,
we were honest
with each other.
But you knew you were gonna
be here with him today,
and you let me propose to you.
I didn't...
I know that giving you
the ring was stupid.
That's fine.
And maybe this wasn't
gonna work out between us.
But this...
You should've told me
about this.
Oh, it's hard, you know,
to choose the people
we fall in love with.
To love only
one person at a time.
People like us
are more complicated.
Us?
I'm sorry.
I'm here with friends.
Ellen,
you're a regular here, right?
You ever see
that woman before,
in the corner?
No. Only when I came in.
And wondered when they were
gonna start enforcing
a dress code.
Ellen, the bathroom's

I'm interested
in navigational weaknesses.
Wormholes,
dark matter blind spots.
Likely ambushes.
I would avoid these
pulsar pointers because of
dradis interference.
If I was gonna
plan an ambush,
I'd do it there.
It depends, Admiral.
They adapt
to your every move.
Every move triggers
a countermove.
Adapt. That's what
you're good at, right?
Why won't you answer
my question?
Does the Fleet know
I'm on Galactica?
(BOOMER MOANlNG)
It's the baby.
She's kicking.
The Fleet knows.
That'll be all for today.

You know, if people knew
how much you've relied

so-called intelligence,
they'd be scared
out of their wits.
What about you, Saul?
Are you afraid of her?
You know, the truth is
I don't like the way
it's gotten under your skin.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
The pressure hatch
can withstand
explosive decompression.
The only way help's getting in
is with a raft
of high explosives.
Or we could just
let these clowns
open the pressure door for us.
There's bound to be

Open the door for us?
Why would they do that?

You've just made
the worst mistakes
of your life.
Colonel Tigh, Admiral,
you need to hear this.
ELLEN: Saul.
Ellen. What's wrong?
They're holding us hostage.
They're threatening
to kill us!
My name is Sesha Abinell.
I have seized control
of the Cloud 9 lounge
and held the people in it
hostage.
What do you want?
What do I want?
This is not about what I want.
The Colonial Fleet has become
a Cylon-occupied territory.
You are working in collusion
with a Cylon agent.
The very same model
of the Cylon
that tried to murder you,
Admiral Adama,
on your own ship.
We want Sharon Valerii.
You have two hours.
Get me everything you can
on Sesha Abinell.
Yes, sir.
GAETA: Sesha Abinell.
Fleet records indicate
she's the widow
of a Ray Abinell.
He was a casualty aboard
the Greenleaf freighter
when the Cylons hit it
about 10 weeks ago.
Widow.
Who do we have
aboard Cloud 9?
Rotation schedule shows
Captain Adama,
half a Marine squad,
and Starbuck's already there
on R and R.
Get me Starbuck right away.
Yes, sir.
Hell, one of you beauties
has got to be an O2 sensor.
And I'm guessing it's you.
Take a sip of carbon dioxide.
There was another guy
at the bar.
Check the back.
We don't want
any more mistakes.
Kern,
there's an awful lot
of military types here.
And that's why we're here.
To get Galactica's attention,
remember?
Page, you go.
No problem.
(GROANS)
Good to see you, Gunny.
I'm gonna need
some of those gorillas
you call Marines.
Most of my gorillas
are already here, sir.
Just trying to
cop a little R and R.
STARBUCK: Tell me about it.
All right,
here's what we know.
We got an
unknown number of shooters,
at least 20 hostages,
and about a 90-minute window
before they start
throwing out bodies.
You got a plan, sir?
Lock and load.
Let's figure out the rest
as we go along.
Put your weapon down!
Tell them.
He says he's Captain Adama
from the Galactica.
He just wants to talk.
Talk, that's it.
Just talk.
SESHA: They're together.

There's a reason you don't

You probably nicked a line.
Why don't you let me
talk to the Admiral,
see if we can't
find a way out of this?
I've got two strike teams
inbound to you.
ETA ten minutes.
We'll have
plenty of firepower,
so that's good,
but I'm concerned
with limited access points.
Admiral,
it's Abinell.
ADAMA: Keep Starbuck
on the line with us.
Adama.
We're losing oxygen.
If it's not restored,
the hostages die.
Then you all die,
because this is over.
Not till the Cylon's dead.
I'm willing to die
to see this through.
Are you willing
to risk your son's life?
Son of a bitch.
Suddenly, you're listening.
Gods damn it!
Give her what she wants!
Give her the Cylon!
You're all alone on this,
Admiral.
I'm not gonna sacrifice
a military asset
on your altar of revenge.
What are you talking about?
This isn't...
You said this was about
us being played by the Cylons,
but it isn't. It's about
the loss of your husband,
and I understand that.
It's about you
wanting to strike back,
and I understand that, too.
But we've all lost people
that we care about,
and we learn to live with it.
I am sure
you are aware, Admiral,
of the concrete evidence
that Caprica's defenses
were compromised
by a Cylon agent
who infiltrated
the Ministry of Defense
on the eve of the attacks.
People look for
complicated answers when
something terrible happens.
Maybe we were just
caught by surprise
and were beaten,
and maybe we have to learn
to live with that.
And maybe you are
just missing the point.
You were infiltrated.
You, the military.
And you are being
infiltrated again, right now.
You can sit there and pretend
you know what you're doing,
but you do not.
You are being played.
And the rest of us
do not want to go down
with your ship.
I want this air system
restored right now.
One person comes in alone,
fixes it, leaves.
Anything goes wrong,
somebody gets hurt,
it's on your head.
Keep a direct line open
to Cloud 9.
What do we do?
We repair the air system.
Saul, we can't
give her Sharon.
I hope you know that,
right?
I know that.
We can't start
dealing with the terrorists.
We start now,
it'll open the floodgates,
and it'll never stop.
But, by the way,
it's not Sharon.
It's a frakking Cylon.
You don't think I know that?
I think there's part of you
that looks into
that thing's eyes
and still sees that young girl
that reported aboard
two years ago
as a rook pilot.
Well, it's not.
It never was.
Bill, it's a machine.
Admiral,
it's Captain Thrace.
Sitrep.
STARBUCK: I had one of
the Cloud 9 techs
double-check
the oxygen feed in there.
There's nothing wrong
with the air.
ADAMA: Could be a glitch.
Or maybe someone screwed
with one of the CO2 sensors
in the bar.
Lee? Why?
Maybe he's given us
an opening.
If I can get someone inside,
get a clear idea
of what we're dealing with...
Kara, this is a recon mission.
Get someone to volunteer.
Then you assess the situation,
and then
get the hell out of there.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
I'm here to repair
the O2 line.
Captain,
what are you doing?
Volunteering.
Let me see that.

If we try blowing it open,

We give them Sharon Valerii,
we're inviting terrorism,
and we weaken
our position permanently.
You know that.
Gentlemen,
everyone in that room

someone's wife,
someone's mother.

And if you don't think

Let's not be naive.
What if they're right?
What if Sharon has been
playing us all,
plotting our destruction
with every passing day?
What if the terrorists
are right?
This isn't about Sharon.
It's about something
much bigger than that.
It's about
the long-term survival.
It's about the way
we conduct ourselves
in all of this.
Sir, it's Abinell

How's my son?
Alive, but my friend is dead.
So are two of your soldiers.
And your son's dying.

About how far I'd go.

They're gonna kill her.
Hold your fire.
I'm giving you the Cylon,
but she won't be alive.
What does that mean?
That is not the deal.
It means that
you've convinced me
that we may have been played.
And if that be the case,
and she's been
playing with me,
then I can't take
any more chances.
So you make up your mind.
If you want Sharon Valerii,

I think Buster and Shark are
declaring an emergency, but
their transmission's garbled.
We've lost them, sir.
OFFlCER 1:
I want us to recheck that.
OFFlCER 2: Okay, I need
to check if we're getting
some readouts on the problem.
Yeah? All right,
I'll check again.
Welcome aboard, Major.
I didn't expect
a welcoming committee.
Don't flatter yourself.
I was in the neighborhood.
Major Adama, sir.
Major Adama.
Commander Garner.
Glad to see you, Major,
although I wish it was
under better circumstances.
We have just lost contact
with two of our Raptors
out on a training mission.
What? When did that happen?
Captain Thrace,
perhaps if you were actually
down on the flight deck
and monitoring your Raptors,
the way any training officer
worth a damn would have done,
you would know that four
of our pilots were missing.
Major.
You with me, Major?
Yes, sir.
They disappeared from
the dradis about an hour ago.
They're gone.
Shut the hell up!
We lose two Raptors
in a training mission,
and I only find out
when the Commander
throws it in my face?
Don't all speak at once.
Sir, it's been made clear
that discussing
flight deck situations
with anyone outside
Pegasus crew is not allowed.
Sorry, sir.
And whose frakking
bright idea was that?
It was Garner, wasn't it?
STARBUCK: Of course it was.
So barely competent
and paranoid.
Huh.
There's
a hell of a combination.
I've a problem.
That problem's name
is Kara Thrace.
I know how to handle her, sir.
And for the record, she is
one hell of a Viper pilot.
What, I should cut her
some slack because
she's good in the cockpit,
is that what you're saying?
Because nobody ever cut us
any slack in the engine room.
I can tell you that right now.
But then, I don't know, maybe
being a snipe is different
than being a Viper jockey.
No flashy stunts for us.
No flying by the seat
of our pants down there.
The engine room is like
a finely-tuned watch,
and everything in it
needs to be monitored
and maintained
in a very precise fashion.
Nobody freelances.
Everything is done
in the proper way,
at the proper time,
in the proper order.
Or there'd be no power,
no lights,
no hot showers
for your flyboys.
You know, Major, I think some
of the people around here
could learn a thing or two
from the snipes.
I'm sorry, Madam President,
but it's that time.
Oh.
The campaign meeting.
Mmm-hmm. You've been
putting it off for weeks.
And we do have a presidential
election coming up,
unless you've decided
not to run.
I'm gonna be perfectly
honest with you, Tory.
I've thought about it
a few times,
but, no, I'm still here.
There's so much to do, so
Iet's talk politics.
Great.
Here are the results from
our first fleet-wide poll.
How did you manage this?
I was precinct captain
for the Federalist Party
in Delphi for five years.
We did polls to see what the
mayor should have for lunch.
For what it's worth,
you've managed to walk
a very fine line.
Your presidential bid has the
support of both the military
and the civilian fleet,
and you've received
enthusiastic endorsements
from the Gemenese
religious leaders.
Well, it helps when
your only real rival
is a convicted terrorist.
Am I capable
of leading this fleet?
Absolutely.
And for a time,
I almost had a chance,
until Laura Roslin ascended
from politician to prophet.
The truth is, I can't win.
But you could.
You flatter me,
Mr. Zarek, really,
but I'm not sure I'm cut out
for a life in politics,
as I find the vice-presidency
and everything to do with it
very tedious.
I would imagine carrying water
for Roslin would get
old after a time,
but it's the office
that makes you
the perfect candidate, Doctor.
You're pre-sold.
Really?
To whom?
You'd be surprised how many
people crave the assurances
of cold science
as opposed to
the superstitious ravings
of the Gemenese.
As a scientist,
you offer hope.
Think about it.
And you, Tom?
You'll just step aside,
will you?
I'm just happy to back
a man of true conviction.
A man who remembers
his friends.
CASE: Attention on deck.
APOLLO: At ease.
Where's Stinger?
He's in hack
for mouthing off to Garner.
Stepped on his
precious little toes.
Frakking Garner.
(ALL LAUGHlNG)
STARBUCK: He's such an idiot.
He's just...
All right, lock that up!
Get something straight.
We got two missing Raptor
crews who are gonna be
out of oxygen in 36 hours.
That's all that matters.
So everyone knock off
the schoolyard crap and start
doing your frakking jobs.
Now, we need to start
thinking outside the box.
Which is supposed to be
what you do best.
Sorry, Major.
All right.
I wanna know everything
there is to know
about these missing Raptors
and their crews.
I wanna know personal
quirks, aircraft squawks,
wireless transmissions,
anything that might help.
Good. Get to it.
How is she?
Rya's four months pregnant
and doesn't wanna be.
I understand the Gemenese have
a problem with women
terminating their pregnancies.
Tyrol said that she asked
for you by name.
Do you want to tell me
what that's really all about?
Pretty straightforward,
really. I get a note that
a girl is on the way,
she arrives, I do my work,
and she leaves.
I don't ask
a lot of questions.
You're gonna start.
I wanna talk to her.
I'm Admiral Adama.
Don't worry,
I've just come to talk.
It doesn't matter
what you say.
I'm not gonna change my mind.
Your parents are a little
worried about you.
They've contacted me
through the Gemenon
representative.
My parents?
Oh, gods.
Do you have any idea
what they would do to me?
Please, do not send me back.
You're a stowaway
aboard a military ship.
COTTLE: Some people might say
she was a victim
of political persecution.
Hell, she could
apply for asylum.
Asylum.
That's it. I want asylum.
Under Gemenon law,
the girl is still
the property of her parents,
and they can deal with her
once she's safely back
on her ship.
To be honest,
I'm more concerned
with the broader implications
of this matter.
Sarah.
I know you don't
wanna hear this,
but my people, my voters,
are demanding action
on this issue.
We have been through this.
Abortion was legal
under Colonial law
before the attacks,
and so it is still
legal today.
It's obscene.
The scriptures view abortion
as an abomination
in the eyes of the gods.
You cannot equivocate
on this point
if you want our support
in the coming election.
Rya Kibby's petition
for asylum is under review.
Thank you, Sarah,
very much, for coming in.
I'm not turning that girl
over. I'm certainly not
banning abortion.
TORY: Then don't.
But we have to move
aggressively on this thing.
I'm gonna arrange a conference
call with you and the Quorum,
or this is gonna get
out of hand, fast.
She's not Billy.
No, she's not.
(ADAMA SlGHS)
What?
I hate to say this
because I know that
this is a political issue.
The fact is, that number
doesn't go up very often.
I have fought for a woman's
right to control her body
my entire career.
No.
No.
I'm just remembering
what you said
right after the Cylon attack.
That if we really wanna
save the human race,
we better start having babies.
Nothing, nothing,
and more nothing.
Where is Shark's
last transmission?
Well, there's not much there.
"Eve, distress,
bearing, wreck,
"shuns, emerge, read."
They're in distress.
They give a bearing
requesting instructions,
"It's an emergency.
Can you read?"
Maybe. But what's this
"eve" fragment here?
"Eve, distress."
"Eve, distress."
(WHlSPERlNG) Distress call.
Eve. Receive... Received.
Received distress call.
Okay. From who?
I don't know.
But maybe that's where
they went, to go find out.
APOLLO: Commander, Captain
Thrace has a theory about
our missing Raptors, sir.
That's good,
considering she lost them.
Excuse me?
Well, they were out
on one of your so-called
training missions,
weren't they, Captain?
My "so-called"
training missions.
Okay, let's just
take this easy.
That's when you're not
boozing or sowing mutiny
amongst the crew.
Mutiny.
Commander, we should take this
to a private place.
Don't you think I know what's
happening on my own ship?
"Barely competent
and paranoid."
That was off the record.
I was just venting.
Accurately.
I'll have you court-martialed.
Commander, I'm not defending
Captain Thrace's behavior...
Thanks, Major.
Captain Thrace,
you're restricted to quarters
until I can ship you back
to Galactica.
You're Adama's pet.
Let him deal with you.
Major?
Sir.
You've been onboard less than
four days and you're
already facing charges.
You don't waste any time,
do you?
Neither do you, Lee.
How's it feel being
Garner's new playmate?
I'm here to do a job.
Yeah, keep a loudmouth,
disobedient, frak-up
Kara Thrace in line.
Not doing such a good job,
are you?
Evidently not.
We don't have much time,
those guys are running
out of air.
Yeah, well, I tried,
all right?
All I have done since I got
to The Beast is try and help,
and all I've gotten is
Garner's foot in my ass.
Well, maybe you need
a kick in the ass!
All right.
Here we go, finally.
What is your problem, anyway?
What's my problem?
What's my problem?
Well, Kara, my problem is you.
You keep frakking up,
and I keep having
to clean it up,
and I am officially
sick of it.
Poor Lee, your life
is so hard, isn't it?
You mean since I got shot?
You wanna hear what I think
happened to Buster or not?
Pegasus, Red Devil.
I'm nearing
the last coordinates
where our Raptors
went missing.
SHARK: (ON RADlO)
Repeat, emer...
There are...
RED DEVlL:
Buster, is that you?
This is Red Devil, man.
Is that you, buddy?
Come back to me.
SHARK: (ON RADlO)
Out of power.
Oxygen almost out.
By the gods, help!
Sir, one of our search Raptors
just picked a possible
distress signal
from near where Pegasus
lost communications
with Buster's ship.
Finally.
A possible distress signal.
There's a theory that Buster
himself might have jumped away
to run down
a phony distress call.
It could be a trap.
A theory?
Is this your theory, Major?
This is Captain Thrace's
theory, is it not?
Mr. Thornton, can you give us
a fix on where this distress
signal is coming from?
Yes, sir, it's long range,
over 40 SU away.
Then spin up the FTL drive
and prepare to jump the ship.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this isn't just
Captain Thrace's theory.
I think this is a Cylon trap,
and...
And I disagree.
Now get Admiral Adama
on the line.
I'm going to get our men.
Admiral, we've finally got
the break we've been
looking for,
a bearing on
the distress signal.
I can jump there
inside of two minutes.
Commander, believe me,
I understand how you feel.
The Cylons have been known
to lure our ships into traps
using fake distress calls.
Have you considered that?
We have, sir. It's a scenario
we don't think likely.
We?
Major Adama, do you concur?
Sir,
Captain Thrace and l
are of the opinion that
the first two Raptors
may very well have been
lured away by just
such a trick.
An opinion
I do not share, sir.
We'll send a recon mission
in full force.
Five Raptors.
Three escort, two rescue.
You have your orders,
Commander.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Major.
I'm sure your expertise
is needed elsewhere.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I am curious.
Why the sudden interest
in the fleet's
demographic projections?
An issue has emerged
that may prove divisive
to our administration.
I would like all the facts
in hand before making
my decision.
So now it's
our administration.
She must be desperate.
Well, I'm a very busy man.
Luckily, I made an initial
calculation on these figures
over seven months ago
when nobody seemed interested
or concerned.
All I had to do was factor
in the numbers
from the Pegasus crew.
It took me hardly any time
at all and I didn't mind.
Look, I'll save you
the bother. You needn't
read the report.
If we continue
on our present course,
within the next 18 years,
the human race
will simply be extinct.
ROSLlN: (ON PA) Since assuming
the Presidency, I've made it
my mission to maintain
the rights and freedoms
we so enjoyed
prior to the attack.
One of these rights has now
come into direct conflict
with the survival
of the species.
And I find myself
forced to make
a very difficult decision.
The issue is stark.
The fact is that if
this civilization
is to survive, we must,
must repopulate this fleet.
Therefore, I am issuing
an executive order.
From this day forward,
anyone seeking to interfere
with the birth of a child,
whether it be the mother
or a medical practitioner,
shall be subject
to criminal penalty.
Thank you.
OFFlCER: (ON PA SYSTEM)
All flight deck personnel,
please report to stations.
CASE: All right, come on.
Let's go! Let's go!
Captain Case, what's going on?
We've been ordered
to scramble, condition one.
Ship's getting ready to jump,
we're gonna launch
on the other side.
Get down to the hangar deck.
What?
Look, you're the best pilot
we've got, so get down there,
and find a Viper.
It's about time you
admit that!
Commander, what's our sitrep?
This is a rescue mission,
Major.
On whose authority?
Mine. I'm bringing
my pilots home.
All due respect, sir,
but if this is a Cylon trap,
then we are entering blind.
We should send
a force recon...
My pilots are dying down
there, Major. I'm going in.
I'm not waiting on recon.
Commander,
this is in direct violation
of the Admiral's orders.
Major, leave combat...
Making this an illegal action
on your part, sir.
You are relieved, Major.
Sergeant of the Guard.
I am forced to take command
of this vessel...
This man is in direct
disobedience of an order...
...under federal regulations
and place you under arrest.
Sergeant, take him below.
Sergeant, the Commander
has been properly relieved.
Escort him to his quarters.
This man is not
a member of this crew,
and you will obey
a direct order that you
have been given by me,
and you will do it now.
Major, if you'll come with me.
Admiral,
the Pegasus has jumped.
They're gone.
Dradis signal's clean.
Jump put us clear
of any interference.
Sir, I show two Raptors.
Transponder codes match.
They're ours.
Mr. Hoshi, tell the CAG to
launch our recovery team, and
let's bring our people home.
Aye, sir.
Pegasus, Red Devil.
Our two birds look intact.
I can't quite see inside yet.
Commander, we're unable
to raise the Raptors
on wireless.
Pegasus, both Raptor crews
are dead.
I repeat, they're all dead.

Well, then

It's gotta be a sensor.
Just pull it.
No, no. Listen to me.

There's structural damage
along the topside

They can't take much more

those drives are back up?
I don't know.
They don't seem to understand.
I need to go down there.
You have the con.
(PlLOT SPEAKlNG ON RADlO)
Yes, sir.
I have the con.
(ALARM BLARlNG)
Make for the nearest Baseship,
and roll us over
to keep our topside
out of their line of fire.
Hoshi,
contact Starbuck and Case.
Tell them I've assumed command
and to concentrate
on protecting our topside.
Aye, sir.
Wilco, Pegasus.
We got your back.
Mr. Gaeta, any contact?
Negative, sir.
Give me this.
Can I get through there?
Baseship dead ahead.
We're closing rapidly.
We can't keep taking hits
like this, Major.
Helm, steady as you go.
Have the bow batteries
stand by for salvo fire.
Target their center axis.
Yes, sir.
See if we can't
cut down the odds.
We need those FTLs
fixed soon or we're dead.
(EXPLOSlON)
Twenty-two hundred.
Main battery
has a firing solution.
Fire.
CREWMAN: I wouldn't try it
without a canteen, sir.
GARNER: Coolant pressure's
off-scale low.
Primary inlet's choked.
The pressure's dropping.
We've got a hull breach
in there somewhere.
Well, we gotta get in there
and open the auxiliary valve.
We can't do that, sir.
We have to!
Sir, that breach could vent
all our oxygen into space!
We don't have a choice.
Now open the hatch!
(AlR WHOOSHlNG)
Breathing gear?
We used it all
in fighting the fire, sir.
Give me a sledge
and a number 12 spanner.
Okay.
Now, close this hatch
behind me. We're losing air.
Close the goddamn hatch!
Close it!
The Baseship's turning away.
He's...
He's frakking running, Major!
But the other two aren't.
They're coming hard.

I'm gonna see

Jump.
You give Garner
a lot of credit.
Well, it's all true.
He gave his life
to save the ship.
Starbuck's report
wasn't so kind.
Well, she had her perspective
and I had mine.
In your opinion,
off the record,
what was Garner's flaw?
He was used to working
with machines.
Command is about people.
Remember that
as you take command
of The Beast.
Garner was my decision.
His failure's
my responsibility.
Don't let me fail
a second time.
Congratulations, Commander.
Madam President, word has it
that you do not intend
to prosecute the Gemenese girl
on Galactica.
She has a name, Sarah.
And I think that Rya
has suffered enough.
She's just been through
an abortion.
I've granted her asylum
aboard Galactica.
This is in total violation
of the law.
My order came after
she sought her procedure.
No laws have been broken.
The girl belongs at home
with her parents.
I insist.
You have your pound of flesh,
and I suggest you take
your victory and you move on.
Ma'am.
(SlGHlNG)
You realize you're screwed,
right?
All the pressure,
the responsibility,
the sleepless nights.
All the officers
giving you a hard time.
Yeah, well, it could be worse.
You could be my CAG.
I'm gonna stay here
and be Galactica's CAG.
Something about wanting
to keep an eye on me.
Well, you and Colonel Tigh
have a lot of fun at those
early morning briefings,
'cause the XO's a lot of fun
the first thing.
Great.
Congratulations.
Really.
Congratulations.
You deserve it.
I know why
I was mad at you, Kara.
A simple thank you
would've been sufficient.
Because you were doing
what you always did.
Buck authority
and get away with it.
I bucked authority once,
and I almost lost everything.
So I guess when I showed up
on Pegasus and there you were,
doing it all over again...
I don't know.
It pissed me off.
Doesn't make
a lot of sense, does it?
You should hear the way
my brain works sometimes.
Are we okay?
You have a brain?
(REPORTERS ASKlNG QUESTlONS)
Madam President,
your decision to criminalize
abortion has created a furor.
Do you think that's hurt
your standing in the polls?
Absolutely.
If I may, Madam President.
It is true, in the light
of recent events,
the President may have
lost support in some quarters.
I would ask the people
to understand that, if this
is an extreme decision,
we live in extreme times.
The decision has been made
with good faith.
I, however, cannot with good
conscience support it.
I'm so sorry,
Madam President,
but the Cylon have no
understanding of the meaning
of the word freedom.
How could they?
They're programmed machines.
Every time you take away
one of our freedoms,
every time we restrict
or curtail one of our rights,
we become one step closer
to being like them.
As the Vice President,
I am bound to follow
the administration's lead.
As President,
I should have
no such strictures.
Given the current situation,
I'm afraid that I have
no alternative
but to announce that I am,
as of now, a candidate
for the Presidency.

but even after all this time,
I still feel awkward.
I was a klutz, too.
I used to knock things over.
I was forever
tripping over things and...
You know what,
you get over it.
And you know what,
this is a great chance
to cleanse.
You've got a new body,
a new life.
And anything
that you've built up,
like anxieties
or remorse or guilt,
just let it wash away.
I can't tell you
how thankful I am.
You've been
a really big help to me.
No, it's me who's thankful.
We all are.
You are a war hero.
We could not have won
without you.
Excuse me.
I just wanted to say,
it's an honor to have you
here on Caprica with us.
What you did...
Well, that's inspiring.
Thank you.
(BEEPlNG)
Hey. How you doing?
I'm freezing.
I can't feel my legs.
That's the epidural.
What happened?
You passed out
and started bleeding again,
but everything's
gonna be all right.
Like hell it is.
I find it absolutely amazing.
You people went
to all the trouble
to appear human
and didn't upgrade
the plumbing.
You have a detached placenta.
Baby has to come out now,
or we could lose you both.
Okay, sir,
I'm gonna have to ask you
to step back, please.
She's tachycardic
and her blood pressure's
dropping.
Yeah,
she's hemorrhaging again.
We're gonna have to
make the cut, now.
HELO: Sharon, can you hear me?
BOOMER: Helo.
(SlGHlNG)
I still can't get
used to this.
Well, you're a hero
of the Cylon now.
You're our first celebrity.
No, I'm just another Six.
You're too modest.
I'm just another Three,
and they're Fives
and, oh, Eights.
But you? Everyone
calls you Caprica Six,
Iike you're the only Six
on the planet.
And what you did
was incredibly difficult.
To seduce a man
so emotionally and physically,
so that he grants you access
to all the most closely
guarded secrets of his people.
I mean,
that mission could be
profoundly disturbing.
Disturbing?
She mean sleeping with me
or killing billions of people?
Because I rather thought
you enjoyed sleeping with me.
It was difficult at times.
See, nobody here
can possibly understand
what you've been through,
which is why
we need your help.
There's another Cylon
who's been having trouble
reintegrating
after a download.
Another hero, actually.
An Eight still insists
on calling herself Sharon.
And you thought I could help?
I'm still having...
I'm having problems
of my own.
Caprica, you don't understand.
She really needs your help.
If we don't
turn her around soon,
there's talk of boxing her.
Putting her memories
in cold storage?
You can't be serious!
Well,
that's a charming way to deal
with emotional problems.
One might almost
call it inhuman.
Oh, that's right, you are.
All right, look,
it is a last resort.
But she's been regressing.
Please.
She's living up there
in that apartment.
It's the one she had
when she thought
she was human.
Security's minimal.
Two Centurions
patrol out front.
The third bullet-head
walks the perimeter.
The bullet-head
walking perimeter makes
random changes to his patrol.
Be tough to get past him.
All right,
so we go under them.
The storm drain leads
directly to the garage
underneath the cafe.
There'll be dozens
of skin jobs inside.
HELO: She's not breathing!
COTTLE: Suction it.
ISHAY: Right away, doctor.
What's going on?
Where are you taking her?
Her lungs aren't
fully developed.
She needs oxygen support.
But she's alive, right?
Right?
(BABY CRYlNG)
There's your answer. Now,
you get the hell out of here.
We've got to stop
the mother bleeding,
or she's not going to make it.
(ROCK MUSlC PLAYlNG ON STEREO)
You here to kick me out?
No.
If you're here to help me
with my adjustment problems,
I can save you some time.
(GRUNTS)
This is home.
I'm not leaving.
I lived on Caprica
for two years.
I knew what I was.
Pretended to be human,
but I knew.
If you knew what you were
and you lived on Caprica,
you know what that makes you?
A really good liar.
Start with the elephants.
These are beautiful.
Ithacan?
Hand carved.
My mother gave
them to me the day I left
for the Fleet Academy.
Is this her?
Supposed to be.
Of course, none of it's real.
All fabricated
for my mission.
It's all a lie.
Following God's path
is never easy.
Oh, don't go religious
with this one.
What are you thinking?
Do you think I care
about your God?
Look, God loves you.
This is love.
These people love me.
I love them.
I didn't pretend to feel
something so I could
screw people over.
I loved them.
And then I betrayed them.
I shot a man I love.
Frakked over another man,
ruined his life. And why?
Because I'm a lying machine!
I'm a frakking Cylon!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...
I've got bandages
in the head.
Nicely done.
You timed it perfectly.
BALTAR:
Scratch your face with
the side of your fingernail
the moment
the glass hits the wall.
(DOOR OPENlNG)
Never saw a Cylon
show fear before,
especially the Sixes.
They're usually
so hardcore.
Feign fear
and emotional vulnerability.
You're very good, you know.
But I'm better.
Let me help you.
I'm different.
I'm different.
I'm more like you.
I'm more like you.
I had someone
I met here. A man.
I loved him
and I think he could've
loved me eventually.
Half a cigarette should
give us two or three minutes
to get the frak out of there.
Any longer and we risk
them finding the charges
before they go off.
Is it two minutes or three?
About to find out.
This is a risky operation
just to nail
a couple of dozen skin jobs.
You know, we can't kill them.
They'll just download
into a new body, and...
I mean, what's the point?
That skin job with Starbuck,
Sharon, they called her,
she said
that when they download,
they remember everything,
right up until the end.
These skin jobs
are gonna remember being blown
into tiny little pieces.
That's gotta hurt.
Yeah.
I hope it hurts a lot.
Because sooner or later
the message sinks in.
There is no safe place,
not even a cafe.
So if you want to quit
living through hell
and dying over and over again,
then get the frak off
our planet.
Three minutes, 10 seconds.
Boom.
NO. 6: His house
was on a bluff over a lake.
I always loved the view.
The sunlight on the water.
It's my favorite spot
in the universe.
Yes, magical.
Too bad you nuked it.
After I downloaded,
I went back
to the ruins of his house.
Why?
Like you,
I was looking for some sort
of connection to him.
Found a few of his things,
even held on to them
for a while,
but I realized they were
keeping me from truly
embracing my new life.
BOOMER:
So, what did you do with them?
I burned them.
But I felt liberated.
Yeah, it's a beautiful story,
isn't it?
A shame
it's all a pack of lies.
So, who was he?
This man you loved?
Maybe you've heard of him.
Gaius Baltar.
Doctor Baltar?
Yeah.
He gave you access
to the Colonial defense grid?
He was the one
who betrayed us?
"Us." Oh, I love it.
This one thinks
she's more human than Cylon.
Just like someone else I know.
Does he still work
for the Cylons?
What?
On Galactica?
He's...
He's alive?
He's the Vice President
of the Colonies.
You didn't know that?
If the baby does survive,
the question is,
what do we do with it?
Do?
What are you suggesting?
That we throw it out
of an airlock?
I don't make
suggestions, Mr. Baltar.
If I want to toss a baby
out an airlock, I'd say so.
Well, it's really gratifying
to know that infanticide
is not on the table.
Do I have to point out
that this is not a baby?
It's a machine.
No, it's half machine,
half human.
I suggest we all
keep that half in mind.
The Cylons went through
a great deal of trouble
to create this thing.
It should go without saying
that if it's good for them,
it's gonna be bad for us.
I completely agree.
And I take it as a given,
we can't turn it over
to Sharon to raise.
That would be disastrous.
ADAMA:
There's still another factor
to consider here.
There are Cylons
aboard this fleet.
If they find out
this thing's been born,
they're gonna
make a play for it.
You can see
where this is headed, Gaius.
We're gonna have to
take our child.
BOOMER: Hello, Hera.
(BOOMER EXCLAlMlNG)
She's got quite a grip on her.
You don't like it in there,
do you, Hera?
You gotta stay until
your lungs get stronger.
BOOMER:
Oh, she's our little girl.
We made her.
Almost makes you
want to believe
in the Cylon God.
Almost.
I love you so completely.
It's clear.
Here, take these.
Let's move!
Here you go.
Why do you think
they kept it from you?
Is the wrong question.
The right question is,
why did she get me
to work with you,
knowing that you'd
tell me the truth?
She knew I had feelings
for Gaius.
Knew that I had trouble
letting go of him.
She must've known
it would trigger
those feelings,
and those memories.
She's frakking with you,
can't you see that?
But why?
Oh, it's so perfectly obvious.
You know, for self-aware
cybernetic life forms,
sometimes you can be
unbearably obtuse.
Oh, for God's sake!
BALTAR: Careful.
Everything okay?
Fine.
Just talking with Sharon here.
Yeah, what about?
She asked me to move out.
Ah, you know what?
Which is what we've been
asking her for weeks.
I was kind of hoping
that you'd see the light
after talking
to our friend here.
She is lying, unfortunately.
She has no wish
to see Sharon cured.
They're just gonna do it.
They're going to box her.
ANDERS: How many Cylons
up in the cafe?
Full house. At least 40.
Three minutes, 10 seconds.
We've just made
a breakthrough.
She's agreed to move out
of her apartment.
Didn't you, Sharon?
Yeah.
I'm moving out
of the apartment.
When?
Whenever.
What about now?
I'll help. The apartments
are right upstairs.
Sure.
Let me...
Let me just get some things.
Good work, Six.
Must have been
some chat, huh?
Yes.
We had a lot
to talk about.
She's right behind you.
I know.
(TlMER BEEPlNG)
(DOOR OPENlNG)
(METALLlC FOOTSTEPS)
This is not a debate.
This child will not
be raised by the Cylon,
and I cannot risk Cylon agents
getting their hands on it.
I've made my decision.
What I need from you, Doctor,
is your help.
Fine. I don't like it,
but have it your way.
I need it immediately.
We'll have to find
somebody suitable.
I have to work up
a list of names.
Each of them is capable,
each of them is anonymous,
and each can be trusted.
Thought of everything,
haven't you?
I hope so.
Are you all right, Sharon?
(COUGHlNG)
What happened?
Explosion.
Building came down on us.
Looks like
the stairwell saved us.
Where's Six?
Her body's dead.
(GASPlNG) No, not yet.
Help me out here.
Would've been better
if the explosion
had killed her.
There's nothing
we can do about the pain
until we get out of here.
Hey, Six,
I can get a crossbeam
and put you out
of your misery.
I'm not gonna give up
on life again.
It's your choice.
(GROANlNG)
(SCREAMS)
D'ANNA: Where the heck
are we, anyway?
Must be in the garage.
The north entrance
might be that way.
Then I'm gonna start digging.
(GRUNTlNG)
Hang in there.
(NO. 6 PANTlNG)
(GROANlNG)
BOOMER: You're gonna be okay.
Another survivor.
Yeah.
Hang on, buddy.
We'll get you out.
Fresh air coming
from down there.
(ANDERS COUGHlNG)
Thanks. I thought
I was a goner.
Frakking human.
You know, he probably set
that explosion.
What, from the Resistance?
Why?
No military value to the cafe.
Humans don't respect life
the way we do.
No!
I won't let you kill him.
She's right.
Don't kill him.
Why not?
Hmm.
Why not kill him?
You've already killed
billions of people.
Do you honestly believe
one more body's
gonna weigh any heavier
on your conscience?
Which is something
that you don't have.
Do you?
We should interrogate him.
Find his accomplices.
Okay.
You can let go now, Sharon.
What's this?
BOOMER:
Looks like Colonial Fleet lD.
"Thrace, Kara."
Starbuck?
She was on Caprica
a couple of weeks ago.
She escaped with the help
of another Sharon.
If she gave him this,
he meant something to her.
Well, ain't it sweet?
BALTAR:
You have it in your hand.
Hard, physical proof
of one person's love
for another.
If only you felt
this deeply about us.
I did.
I do.
I love you, Gaius.
Where's the tangible proof?
HELO: I don't understand.
She was doing so well.
COTTLE: Oh, no, she wasn't.
I tried to tell you that.
Her lungs
were never fully developed.
She finally went into
respiratory distress.
We couldn't get her intubated
in time and we lost her.
I'm sorry.
(SOBBlNG)
I should have been here.
(BOOMER CRYlNG)
HELO: Sharon,
you need sleep, okay?
You've lost a lot of blood.
You murdered her.
Sharon, come on.
Who ordered it?
Adama? The President? Who?
I don't kill patients.
We did the best we could.
But she's dead.
And that's all
there is to it.
I should be able
to release the ashes
to you in a few hours.
Murderer.
HELO: Sharon! Sharon.
Die!
(BOOMER SCREAMlNG)
BOOMER: You're all murderers!
MAN: Stay back!
You're all murderers!
Get her out of here!
Easy! Easy! Easy!
(BOOMER SCREAMlNG)
You let them murder our child.
I am so sorry.
I tried. I tried my best.
God's will was that
our child should survive.
His will was that she would
lead the next generation
of God's children.
His will was that
you would protect her.
Yes.
Listen, you have committed
a monstrous
and unforgivable sin.
And now you and your entire
wretched race are gonna suffer
God's vengeance.
She's so beautiful.
(BABY GURGLlNG)
I don't know
how to thank you.
When I lost my baby,
I didn't know
how I could go on.
Well, I'm glad
things worked out for you
and this little girl.
I can't believe
somebody would give up
this little angel.
You understand, Maya,
that this adoption requires
absolute secrecy.
The mother
is a Pegasus officer
and must remain anonymous
for political
and religious reasons.
You have my word.
Maya, you won't mind
if I drop in occasionally?
Oh, of course not.
Good.
Go.
Thank you.
I know how awful
this was for you,
but trust me,
it was imperative.
As far as the Cylons know,
this child no longer exists.
That is a good, good thing.
(GROANlNG)
Is this what
you're looking for?
You can have it.
Here.
What're you doing?
Just making it easy for him
to get what he wants.
Come on.
I'll give you a head start.
I'm fine where I am.
(CRASHlNG)
Hey, they're coming for us
and you.
They'll be
very interested in you.
Leave him alone.
Sharon,
you're a hero of the Cylon.
Now you're just
a broken machine
who thinks she's a human.
But you're not a human,
Sharon,
and you never will be.
Yeah, well,
at least I'm not a murderer.
I have a conscience.
And I know the difference
between right and wrong.
A murderer is exactly
what you are.
Life is short,
but the next one's not.
Let your heart adrift
and your soul will get caught.
I love you, Gaius.
My heart and soul are yours.
(CRASHlNG)
They're nearly here.
You know why they wanted you
to work with Sharon?
So you'd lose your mind.
They're gonna box you,
darling.
Just like
they're gonna box Sharon.
We're dangerous.
What?
Sharon and l.
We're celebrities
in a culture based on unity.
No.
Our voices count.
More than hers.
More than others'.
We're two heroes
of the Cylon, right?
Two heroes
with different perspectives
on the war.
Perspectives based
on our love
of two human beings.
(SNlFFLlNG)
That's why she wanted me
to work with you,
so that you'd tell me
that Gaius was still alive.
And she wanted me
to lose my mind.
No, you're corrupted
by your experiences.
D'ANNA: You're a waste.
Believe the lies,
ignore the truth.
Listen to me,
I will show you the proof.
Speak from your heart.
Say the things
that you know to be true.
Genocide,
murder, vengeance,
they're all sins
in the eyes of God.
That's what you and I know.
That's what
they don't wanna hear.
Because then they'd have to
rethink what they're doing.
They'd have to consider
that maybe the slaughter
of mankind was a mistake!
(CRASHlNG)
God loves me.
We'll see you again soon!
Here.
Looks like
they're almost here.
You should get out
of here while you can.
The fresh air coming in
might lead you out.
Is this some kind of trick?
You can stay and be tortured
if you want.
Your call.
(JACKHAMMERlNG)
Who are you?
What kind of people are you?
I don't know.
BOOMER: Hey, wait.
How long till she downloads
and tells them what happened?
We had a lot of people
in the cafe.
At least 36 hours
till they get to her.
Long enough.
Long enough for what?
To change things
for the better.
What are you talking about?
I have never loved anyone
more in my life
than I love you now.
(JACKHAMMERlNG)
Our people need
a new beginning.
A new way to live
in God's love.
Without hate.
Without all the lies.
All they need is
for someone to show
them the way.
Someone like two heroes
of the Cylons.
(JACKHAMMERlNG)
I'm with you.
(RUMBLlNG)
DORAL: We found them!
They're alive!
Yes, we are!
We're alive.
NARRATOR: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.
The Raiders
are going to send a signal
to activate the virus.
On my mark,
initiate the computer wipe.
I'm connecting
to the network now.
Congratulations, Commander.
I'm leaving Galactica,
not you.
I'm coming back.
I said it.
I meant it.
I understand what it's like
to lose someone
that you care about deeply.
They're not lost. Not yet.
We have to go back to Caprica.
Given the current situation,
I'm afraid that I have
no alternative
but to announce that I am,
as of now, a candidate
for the Presidency.
(REPORTERS CHATTERlNG)
I'm gonna lose.
(MUTTERlNG)
(KNOCKlNG AT DOOR)
Yes, come in.
One minute,
Madam President.
Thank you, Tory.
No one should be
under any illusions about
what we're gonna face here.
Our final jump will take us
intra-atmosphere,
Iess than two clicks
above the surface.
We're also expecting
to take heavy fire.
Simulations indicate
losses of up to 20%
can be expected.
20%!
That's why this mission
has been designated
as Two-Alpha
by the command authority.
It's volunteer only.
You want out,
now's the time.
I know it's hard
to believe right now,
but if you have faith,
everything will turn out
exactly as it should.
I don't like to lose.
Have faith.
I'm about to face
public humiliation,
and you are singing
the same old song.
I'm a little tired
of the melody.
Oh.
Sorry about the mess.
It's a bit of a ritual.
Superstition, really.
I used to do this
before testifying
at committee hearings.
This is what I do.
I take...
Memorize the talking points,
then tear the card,
Iet the pieces
fall as they may.
It helps.
Yeah, my father
used to break pencils
before he went into court,
then borrow one
from the clerk.
Break preconceptions.
Work with what you have.
You know, I like that.
Let me see.
I like it.
(EXHALlNG)
That's good.
Feel better?
Yeah, but what happens
if the moderator
doesn't have a pencil?
Then you're pretty screwed.
Oh.
(GlGGLlNG)
Oh, no.
I used to get the giggles
before debate team
in high school.
(KNOCKlNG AT DOOR)
Yes?
It's time, Madam President.
Thank you, Tory.
(LAUGHlNG)
What many of you don't know
is that the captured
Cylon Heavy Raider
is capable
of much longer jumps
than our Raptors.
In fact, we realized early on
that if we could install
the Heavy Raider
navigational system
aboard one of our Raptors,
a strike team
could make the entire trip
back to Caprica
in less than 10 jumps.
Now, the limiting factor
up until now
has been our inability
to install the Cylon computer
with our computer.
That obstacle
has now been overcome.
She's here to help us.
She's gonna lay out
our navigational markers
and update
our jump coordinates.
Does anyone
have a problem with that?
You've been chosen
to lead these people
by Almighty God.
It will happen.
Like the baby happened?
The one
I was destined to protect?
Don't let your anger drive you
into blasphemy, Gaius.
The election's still
two weeks away.
Get your act together.
You ready?
Yeah, I was just taking
a little nap.
Chief?
(CLANGlNG)
This is our mission.
It's our duty
to the people we left behind.
And if we need to use a Cylon
to get them back,
then so be it.
This is about trying to get
as many survivors off Caprica
as we can.
Even so, it's still Two-Alpha.
Anyone want to eject?
Commander on deck!
Don't worry.
I won't be long.
I want to hear it, too.
You just have
to really try to think
about something serious.
That always helps.
All right?
Like what?
Well, like...
Great.
No one has ever attempted
a rescue mission
from this distance,
much less behind enemy lines.
You'll be making history
just by making the attempt.
But bring these people
back from Caprica,
and you'll be making
part of the future.
Questions?
If you guys find Earth
before we get back,
will you save us a few seats?
Earth, hell, we find
any rock with food and water,
I'll build you guys a bar.
All right.
See? I told you
I wouldn't be long.
Mr. Gaeta,
turn on the wireless.
Let's give these people
a chance to hear
what kind of fun
they'll be missing
for the next five days.
McMANUS: (ON RADlO)
We're just minutes away
from the start of the first
presidential debate between
President Laura Roslin...
You okay?
...and her opponent,
Vice President Gaius Baltar.
Can I go now?
All the questions...
Corporal Madsen.
...submitted by members
of the civilian fleet here
cover a wide range of topics.
So, please, stay tuned
as we get set now
for the first
of two presidential debates.
The atmosphere
in the auditorium is tense
as we await the arrival
of the two candidates
and their aides.
The real pressure will be
on Vice President Baltar
tonight...
Chief?
Bullseye. Here comes
Vice President Gaius Baltar
into the room
as we await Madam President.
Laura Roslin is very much
ahead in the polls
at this point.
I believe that
she's entering the room
shortly, but still,
of course, waiting for her.
He is capable
of blindsiding her
as he did when he launched
his candidacy a month ago.
Dr. Baltar, of course,
has long been admired
as one of the most brilliant
scientific minds
of his generation
and played a critical role
in saving the human race
from the Cylon threat.
Yes, here comes
the President now.
Laura Roslin, the President,
has entered the room.
I'm going to wipe the floor
with you, Gaius.
...shake hands,
exchange a few words.
You must be
losing your mind again.
If that's the best
you can come up with,
you really are in trouble.
Good luck.
How you doing?
You okay?
Sharon.
Don't shut me out,
not now.
Something dark
is coming, Helo.
I can feel it.
I can feel it lurking
out there, waiting.
What do you mean?
Back on Caprica?
No.
Not on a mission,
not any specific thing.
It's more like a dark time.
Chief?
Chief?
(CALLY SCREAMlNG)
Help!
Chief Tyrol,
I'm Brother Cavil.
I understand you've asked
for religious counseling.
I never really believed
in psychotherapy.
My father was a priest.
I see.
You thought you'd have
an easier time with a priest
than a real doctor. Okay.
I pray to the gods
every night,
but I don't think
they listen to me.
Do you know
how useless prayer is?
Chanting and singing
and mucking about
with old half-remembered lines
of bad poetry,
and you know
what it gets you?
Exactly nothing.
Are you sure
you're a priest?
I've been preaching
longer than you've been
sucking down oxygen.
And in that time,
I've learned enough to know
that the gods
don't answer prayers.
We're here on our own.
That's the way
they set things up.
We have to find
our own answers, our own way
out of the wilderness
without a nice
little sunny path all laid out
in front of us in advance.
That's what I'm trying to do.
I'm trying to find my way.
Now, it's not gonna get better
until you see
what the problem is.
And the problem is
you are screwed up,
heart and mind.
You, not the gods
or fate or the universe.
You.
Thanks for the pep talk.
Hey.
Hi.
I just wanted to say,
well,
good hunting.
Thank you, sir.
Yeah, it's a good plan.
It's a good plan.
Sharon should be able to jump
you into the atmosphere
a couple of clicks
above the surface.
Down below the Cylon dradis.
I know the plan.
Lee, I wrote it.
Yeah.
I gotta go.
I hope you find him, Kara.
I really do.
So do l.
From the Colonial dispatch,
"Last night's debate
only solidified
the perception..."
MAN: Madam President.
I'll do that later.
"...that Dr. Baltar,
for all his charm,
is essentially an empty suit
"when it comes to matters
of substantive policy."
It's nice to see the press
is getting it right
for a change.
Don't forget,
the radical religious charge
is dangerous.
It may be a low blow
from a desperate man,
but it's the only issue
he's managed to get
any traction on.
He will keep exploiting it.
He's gotta come up
with something much,
much bigger than that
if he wants to make it
the central issue
of his campaign.
It's not gonna work.
(SlGHlNG)
You gotta keep hitting her
on the religious thing.
Every time we go there,
you score points,
and we move the polls
in our direction.
Yes, I'm not sure
if you're aware, Tom,
but the mob
isn't usually in the habit
of electing ungodly apostates
who denigrate people of faith.
Things are gonna
turn around. You'll see.
He's right.
Listen to him.
Of course.
Of course.
How blind I'm being.
Thank you, yes.
"Things are gonna turn around.
You'll see."
What is that? Advice?
Well, thank you.
Thank you
for your keen insight,
your astounding
political acumen.
You know,
I'm so assured right now, Tom,
I'm just gonna sit right back
and wait for the hand of God
to reach down and change
my political fortunes.
How about that?
Galactica, Starbuck.
SAR squadron
confirms readiness check,
and we are spun up out here
and ready for the first jump.
DUALLA: You are go
for the jump, Starbuck.
Roger that.
Jump in ten minutes. Mark.
(BEEPlNG)
Galactica,
I'd like to speak with Actual.
Sir?
Actual. Go.
Did I ever say thank you?
No, but then again,
that would be a first,
wouldn't it?
Thank you.
Just come back in one piece.
That'll be thank you enough.
Good hunting.
Actual out.
SAR Team, Starbuck.
Set navcom inputs
to coordinate re-check.
Standby for bounce-back
and stabilization routines.
Let's do
a final check, people.
Headcase. Check.
Swordsman. Check.
Anvil. Check.
I still can't believe
you talked me into this.
Chinstrap. Check.
It's important.
Gumball. Check.
And I'll be with you
there and back.
It's you and me from now on,
no matter what.
Just like we agreed.
I know. I know.
I really appreciate it, Helo.
I really do.
Raw Meat. Check.
Toyon. Check.
Strakus. Check.
I just can't get her
out of my head,
our little girl.
Playboy. Check.
Polo. Check.
Casey. Check.
Adonis. Check.
Is there a problem?
Gully Man. Check.
Star Cloud. Check.
Racetrack. Check.
Callan. Check.
Wireless check complete.
Board is green,
and we are set.
Sharon, you're on.
Ready.
SAR Team, Starbuck.
Standby to jump on my mark.
Five.
Here we go.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Commence the first jump.
This doesn't look right.
No other contacts on dradis.
What?
Oh, man.
We're at the wrong
jump coordinates.
Frak!
Helo, we've lost
someone already.
It's Racetrack.
Should we go back?
Mission rules say
we keep going
unless we lose three,
so we keep going.
Racetrack will
just have to find
her way back to base.
It's a hell of a way
to start, though.
Let's... Let's talk
about what happened.
I can't really believe
that Cally...
I don't understand
how I could do that
to Cally.
It's like it's a nightmare.
(CALLY SCREAMlNG)
She said you were asleep
when she found you.
Were you having a nightmare
when she woke you up?
I don't remember.
Oh.
Been having
any recurring dreams lately?
No.
Okay, that's what
we in the pray trade
call a lie.
And lies aren't gonna get you
anywhere, my friend.
So skip over the denials
and the deceptions,
and let's get right down
to it, shall we?
You're having dreams.
What are they?
Tell me
about your dream, Chief.
Every night...
Every night it's the same.
For how long?
Couple of weeks.
And you were having
the same dream
when Cally woke you up,
weren't you?
I don't know.
I don't remember. Maybe.
Maybe. It doesn't matter,
does it?
All I remember is
Cally on the ground
and the blood.
She stopped you.
By waking you up,
she prevented you
from carrying out
your secret desire
to kill yourself.
I don't have a secret desire
to kill myself.
Well, actually, you're right.
It's not a secret.
You obviously
want to kill yourself.
Question is, why?
Look, I think there was
some kind of glitch
in the navcom firmware.
Hey, bottom line,
we're to hell and gone
from where we're supposed
to be, Skipper.
Okay, any chance
that we can still
catch up with them?
Not a chance.
Mission rules say
we head back.
Frak me!
It was the first jump!
Hey, look, you gave me
these coordinates.
Yeah...
(MUTTERlNG)
Back to the barn.
Hey, I'm picking up
a large planetary body.
It's frakking close.
Where did that
come from?
Hell if I know.
There's so much
dradis interference here,
it didn't even register.
Let's check this out.
Atmosphere
is nitrogen-oxygen.
Organic molecular spectra.
Fresh water.
Hey, you know what this is?
It's habitable.
We may have just found a world
that can support human life.
Maybe we're not
just a bunch of frakups
after all.
Now, the climate readings
overall are
within human norms.
Oh, there's some extremes
at the poles
that we couldn't withstand,
but that's not unusual.
Well done.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
We got a mottled area here
at the river mouth,
so it's probably a delta,
and chances are
we've got significant
plant and animal life,
so I want a lot
of nice low passes
across here.
I heard
the Pegasus survey mission
found wildlife.
Fruit trees,
rivers of milk and honey.
Yeah, you forgot the lakes
of ambrosia.
Most of the planet
is actually pretty barren.
Plant and animal life
located in a temperate belt
around the equator.
But the best part is,
with all the dradis
interference from the nebula,
the Cylons will probably
never find it.
BALTAR: Who cares about
this stupid planet anyway?
All this song and dance
over nothing.
Less than 20% of that place
actually supports
human life, so...
You're not seeing
the big picture.
This is your new home,
the place where
you will lead a new life.
This is the future, Gaius.
Now, there's
a depressing thought.
What's that?
Oh, nothing, Tom.
Just...
Can you imagine
if we actually had to live
on that thing?
You are a genius.
And?
Pay attention.
You're about to win
the election.
I'm sorry.
What were you saying, Tom?
We needed an issue,
something to set us
apart from Roslin,
something to put her
clearly on the wrong side
of a major issue
our people
care passionately about.
This is it.
(CHUCKLlNG)
Permanent settlement
on this planet.
Permanent settlement, here?
Have you lost your marbles?
It may look dreary.
It may be dreary.
But it's solid ground
under your feet
and real sky
over your head.
You'd be surprised
what a powerful idea
that is to people
cooped up in metal boxes
for nine months.
You should
listen to him, Gaius.
He's a smart, sexy man,
just like you.
Oh, give up.
What?
Give up on Earth.
Yes.
So we'd settle here.
Yes.
(CHUCKLlNG)
(CHUCKLlNG)
You know,
it's starting to look
Iike a lovely little planet
after all.
This is a rest stop,
a place to load up
on food and water.
We're not
settling here, obviously.
You've heard
the captains' reports.
Every ship in the fleet
has people begging, pleading,
demanding they get time
down on the surface,
even if it's only
for a few hours.
Well, a few hours
is one thing,
but permanent settlement's
quite another.
Suddenly, Baltar
is holding out hope
of breathing real air,
growing real food,
sleeping in a bed
instead of a bunk,
Iiving in a house
instead of a ship.
It's a fantasy.
Look at the mission reports.
All the data indicate
that life on this planet
would be hard.
It would be a struggle
to even eke a living out
for a few years.
Today's polls show
that he's also making
headway with the idea
that because the planet
is hidden in a nebula,
it will provide
a refuge from the Cylons.
What, are we now assuming
that Cylon technology
is not sufficient enough
to find this planet?
We just found it.
Madam President,
in my opinion,
people vote their hopes,
not their fears.
Baltar is offering them
what they want to hear,
and you're offering them
a bitter reality.
I'm offering them
the truth.
They don't want
to hear the truth.
They're tired, exhausted.
The idea of stopping,
laying down their burdens
and starting a new life
right now
is what is resonating
with the voters.
How well is it resonating?
It could turn
the entire election around.
Why are you running?
I'm not.
How long
are you gonna do this?
How long are you gonna
refuse to see
what's right in front
of your face?
How... Forget it. I'm done.
What? You're leaving?
That's right. I'm done.
I'm done dancing
around the truth with you.
You know what's going on,
but you can't
or you won't face it, so...
I'm not a therapist.
I'm not gonna hold your hand
and help you along.
I'm just trying to get you
right with yourself
and with your gods,
but you're not willing
to do it.
But...
I don't even know
what you're talking about.
Oh, for gods' sake,
Chief, come on!
You think you're a Cylon.
I am not a Cylon.
Well, of course you're not,
but that's
what you're afraid of,
isn't it?
That you might be a Cylon
and not even know it,
just like Boomer, right?
Right?
That's the thought
that's torturing your dreams
and crippling your soul.
"I'm a Cylon,
just like Sharon,
and I deserve to die."
Sharon didn't know
what she was.
She just kept thinking...
Feeling that she was gonna do
this terrible thing,
but she knew
that she had to stop herself
before she did.
And you think that's
what you're going to do,
some terrible thing.
Well, the truth is,
you might,
but not
because you're a Cylon,
because you're a human being
and human beings
do terrible things
all the time.
Well, how do you know
I'm human?
Oh, well, maybe
because I'm a Cylon,
and I've never seen you
at any of the meetings.
There's not much more
I can do for you.
You're gonna have
to go back to work
and try and leave all of this
behind you.
No, l...
I can't.
I can't go back and face
the deck people again.
Are you...
And Cally!
Well, you better.
That's the only family
you've got.
Just know that
that's your family
and that they love you.
Even Cally.
Especially Cally.
If you doubt your humanity
and your essential nature
as a human being,
all you need to do
is look to them
for the salvation
you've been seeking
from the gods.
The gods lift up those
who lift each other, Chief.
SAR Team, Starbuck.
We are set here.
Stand by
for final jump to Caprica.
Remember, we are going
very low to the surface.
Be prepared for wind shear,
rain, storms, anything.
Roger that, Starbuck.
Ready?
Ready.
Here we go. Jump.
SAR Team, Starbuck.
Form up on me.
Copy that, Skipper.
Any Cylons, Helo?
Nothing on dradis.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
We're missing a Raptor.
I'm only reading 17 out there.
We're missing Raptor 61 2.
That's Toughguy
and Carousel.
What, they jumped
to the wrong coordinates?
No, no, no.
I'm picking up
their transponder,
so they made it.
Bearing 827 carom 443,
about a half click from here.
That would put them...
Oh, my gods.
Where, Helo? Talk to me.
They jumped
inside the mountain.
Damn.
SAR Team, Starbuck.
We've lost Raptor 612.
We are proceeding
without them.
Follow me.
Roger that, Starbuck.
BALTAR: So I would think
that my position
and the position
of my campaign
is abundantly clear.
Thank you.
McMANUS: Madam President,
you have 30 seconds
to respond.
Well, my initial response is,
there he goes again.
Once again,
ladies and gentlemen,
Dr. Baltar is distorting
the real issues before us.
The issue here,
the real question, is not
allowing the scriptures
to dictate the policy
of this government.
The question is,
do the scriptures
contain real-world relevance?
Do they contain
the information necessary
to guide us to a safer home
than some
completely unknown planet
that we've
just now discovered?
Obviously, my answer
to that question is yes.
I have always
and will continue to feel
the scriptures hold
real-world relevance.
Mr. Vice President,
the next question is for you.
How do you respond
to the charges
that you've seized the idea
of permanent settlement
on this planet
as an opportunistic gamble?
Some would say
it's to be construed
as a desperate move
from a campaign
that was falling behind
in every poll.
Well, you know,
that is...
That is an excellent question,
in fact, Jim. Thank you.
And I am only too glad
to have the opportunity
to respond to it.
You see,
I have long been a proponent
in the search for Earth.
The promise of perhaps
finding not only a new home
but also the prospect
of discovering
our long lost brothers
and sisters of the 13th Colony
is a powerful one,
and one I have believed in
heart and soul,
but the trouble is, the Cylons
continue to follow us
as they have done
every step of the way
since the destruction
of the Colonies.
And if we have a chance
to change this dynamic,
to stop this deadly chase,
shouldn't we take it?
My answer is yes.
MAN: Oh, yeah. Come on.
Thank you.
Madam President, 30 seconds.
There's no assurance,
none whatsoever,
that the Cylons
don't already know
about this planet,
that they don't make
regular stops here
looking for us,
and that, in fact, they aren't
simply waiting for us
to settle on the surface
so they can attack us...
I have to respond to that.
I simply have to respond
to that.
I'll give you 15 seconds.
What you've seen right now,
ladies and gentlemen,
is another example
of the President using fear
to drive her campaign.
Fear.
Fear of the gods.
Fear of the Cylon.
Fear of fear itself.
Is it not time
to stop being afraid?
I'm asking all of us
to stop running from our lives
and start living them.
Thank you.
Thank you. That is all
we have time for today.
I'd like to thank
both the candidates
for their frankness today.
A very exciting debate.
And this concludes
the cycle of the debates
for the Presidency.
The polls will open
in three days. Please vote.
Thank you and good night.
(WHlSPERlNG)
Not your night, I guess.
Why don't you go
frak yourself?
MAN: (ON RADlO) With me now
is campaign manager
for Dr. Baltar, Mr. Tom Zarek.
Tom, welcome. You were
in there with us today.
What was your impression?
ZAREK: Well,
I thought Dr. Baltar
did exceptionally well.
Laid out
his vision of the future
and offered the people
a way to end
the suffering and terror
that defines
so many of their lives.
On the other hand,
I found myself wondering
how Roslin's arguments
against settlement
could possibly win.
(WHlSPERlNG)
Watch your footing over here.
On me. Let's go.
Get up to that line,
right there.
Got it?
All right, hold it.
Let's figure out
where we are, Karl.
Resistance base camp
was still another click ahead.
Movement. 1 1:00.
(RUSTLlNG)
Friendlies?
You got
a Samuel T. Anders there?
BAROLAY: Is there
a Kara Thrace there?
If there is, you tell her
she took her good sweet time
getting here.
Friendlies.
What took you so long?
We got Marines and Raptors.
We're gonna get
you and your people
out of here, okay?
As good as your word, huh?
Yeah, good as
my frakking word.
What, did you think
I was gonna leave you here?
Now you feel
like a big frakking idiot,
don't you?
All right, just shut up
and save us already, okay?
Okay, people, this is nice,
but we have toasters
on our ass.
Where are the rest
of your people?
This is it.
Toasters hit our base camp
this morning.
I lost half my crew.
Incoming!
MARlNE: Pull back!
Back to the Raptors!
No!
The shell trajectories
are between us
and the Raptors!
We're cut off!
MARlNE: Men down!
(GUNS FlRlNG)
Stay right there!
Stay right there!
NARRATOR: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.
We lost her.
We did the best we could,
but she's dead. And that's
all there is to it.
It's you and me from now on,
no matter what.
Just like we agreed.
I just can't get
her out of my head,
our little girl.
She's so beautiful.
You understand, Maya,
that this adoption
requires absolute secrecy.
You have my word.
I'm leaving Galactica,
not you.
I don't know how we can.
I don't either,
but I know I'm gonna try
if you will.
I'm Brother Cavil.
I understand you've asked
for religious counseling.
Let's talk about
what happened.
Chief?
Ah!
TYROL: I don't understand
how I could do that
to Cally.
BROTHER CAVlL: You think
you're a Cylon.
I am not a Cylon.
Well, of course you're not,
but that's what
you're afraid of, isn't it?
CAlN: We have our own
Cylon prisoner.
NO. 6: She's obviously
been abused, tortured.
I know a place
where you can stay,
where you will be safe.
Where I can look after you...
Vice President Baltar offered
the contents of this case
as proof of his sincerity.
GlNA: A nuclear bomb?
I'm afraid that
I have no alternative
but to announce that I am,
as of now, a candidate
for the presidency.
What should be
important to you, personally,
is that Roslin's up
three points in the polls.
SKULLS: Hey, I'm picking up
a large planetary body.
Hey, you know what this is?
It's habitable.
We may have just found
a world that can support
human life.
ZAREK: We needed an issue,
something to set us
apart from Roslin.
This is it.
Permanent settlement
on this planet.
What took you so long?
We got Marines and Raptors.
We're gonna get
you and your people
out of here, okay?
Incoming!
MARlNE: Go! Go! Go!
MAN: There's no way out!
Go! Move!
WOMAN: Get up and get going.
They've got us zeroed in.
If we stay here,
they're gonna chew us up!
All right, we've got to
fall back. Position
up this hill. Let's go!
Let's move, people!
MARlNE 1: Let's go! Let's go!
MARlNE 2: Let's go! Let's go!
(SCREAMlNG)
The jaw's set nicely.
You're done here.
I'm kicking you out of here
and sending you back to work.
Work? Like this?
You gotta love a woman
who can complain even with
her jaw wired shut.
You got a visitor.
I'm sorry.
What I did was
unforgivable,
inexcusable.
I didn't come here to...
I forgive you.
No, Cally, no.
It wasn't you. I know that.
It wasn't you.
It was me.
I may have been out of my mind
and not know where I was...
Doing or anything,
but it was me.
You're in pain.
I know you've been in pain
for a really long time.
Don't feel sorry for me.
I care about you.
I always have.
I always will.
BOOMER: Move! Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!
MARlNE: Come on, get up!
Get them up!
Get them up!
This way!
HELO: Let's go!
Get in there! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!
STARBUCK: Come on,
get in here!
HELO: Get him up there!
Get him up there, now!
Sharon, take the gun!
Ammo!
(PEOPLE SHOUTlNG)
STARBUCK: They've got us
boxed in here really good!
Can't reach the Raptors.
The Cylons have
jammed the freqs.
MARlNE: Frak!
Are they still out there?
Watch yourself.
STARBUCK: Yeah,
they're holding back, though.
Yeah, but why?
They're holding position,
sending for non-lethal
weapons.
They want some prisoners
for interrogation.
The rest they're
gonna send to the farm.
STARBUCK: I'm not going back
to one of those farms.
Yeah, well,
you don't have any choice.
None of us will.
They're gonna lob some gas
in here and then we'll all
wake up somewhere else.
Damn.
So what you want to do here?
Sit it out.
Wait and see if she's right.
If she is, then you and me,
we've gotta have an agreement.
An agreement?
I'm not going
back to one of those
farms, Sam. I'm not.
So if she's right
and they throw gas in here,
you do me, I do you.
What are you talking about?
This is what I'm
talking about, okay?
Yeah, okay.
Okay.
Down two more points,
and this after hearing
his notions of social policy.
Not to mention his wishful
thinking that he's calling
security policy.
Are people really
gonna be that stupid?
Are they really gonna be
that shortsighted?
TORY: He's got the only
issue people care about.
Oh, I know. The planet.
That's all anybody wants
to talk about is
a frakking planet.
Excuse my...
My language, Tory.
I'm sorry.
I know in my gut that
settling on this planet's
gonna mean disaster
for humanity, and I will
not say otherwise
just to win an election.
As you wish,
Madam President.
So, I guess I should
start packing up my office
unless you have some
super-secret back-up plan
for victory in your pocket.
There's always a back-up
plan for victory.
Just in time for the priest.
Oh, good.
Send him in.
18 hours.
They're taking their good,
sweet time out there.
They could've overrun us
at any point during the night.
They're up to something.
What are we up to?
Got any brilliant ideas
in that military brain
of yours?
We do the same thing
we always do,
fight them till we can't.
HELO: What do you think?
Let's get
a recon crew together.
Scout the area.
Figure out what's
going on out there.
Clear.
They're gone.
They just left.
Thank the gods.
It's a miracle.
Let us pray.
Lords of Kobol, we trust
in your benevolence and praise
your righteousness.
Give the people
of this fleet the wisdom
to see the goodness
and the strength
of your servant,
Laura Roslin.
Amen.
Admiral?
Madam President...
The Admiral's not here.
This is my meeting.
I wanted us to talk privately,
without the press
getting wind of it.
Please have a seat.
Well, you must have
something very interesting
to say to resort to such
pedestrian methods
of deception.
The question
of permanent settlement
may well be
the most important issue
we face since the attack.
I agree.
Good.
The question should be
carefully studied before
making the final decision.
And the middle of an election
campaign is hardly the time
for careful study.
Therefore, I propose a truce.
You and I will issue
a joint statement
declaring that
the question be tabled
till after this election.
We will both pledge
that regardless
of who is elected,
the decision will be made only
after careful deliberation
involving all elements
of the public,
and after consultation
with the military
and the Quorum of Twelve.
Doctor,
I know we've had
our disagreements,
but this issue transcends
personal disagreement
as well as politics.
I am appealing here
to your sense of patriotism.
Let me tell you,
my sense of patriotism
is doing just fine.
Thank you very much
for asking.
I see it
as my patriotic duty
to lead this fleet
to a new world.
That new world is
unquestionably New Caprica.
But thank you,
Madam President,
for demonstrating to me
just how desperate
your campaign
for reelection has become.
Were you with a blonde woman
on Caprica just prior
to the attack?
What?
She knows.
Were you
with a tall, blonde woman
in the Riverwalk section
of Caprica City,
just prior
to the attack?
She can see
right through you.
Get out of here now.
You'll resort to anything
at this stage, won't you?
I'm afraid my affairs
on Caprica, and who I chose
to consort with,
are none of your business.
You know, I saved your life.
I won't save
your political career.
We are not moving down
to that planet.
If Baltar wins the election...
Baltar won't win
the goddamn election...
If he does, then what?
We're gonna just sit
on this ship and rot
while everyone else gets
to start a new life?
Ellen, my job is
to protect the fleet
from the Cylons,
and that's exactly
what I'll be doing.
If you want
to move down there,
go ahead, be my guest.
Go down and cat around
with all the men,
have yourself a good old time.
Saul, I want you.
XO.
You got to be kidding me.
I'll be right down.
Starbuck's back.
I gotta get down there.
WOMAN: Put him in here!
Hey, hey, guys,
take it easy with it.
Come on.
Am I good or what?
There's gonna be
no living with her now.
It's good to see you.
Welcome back.
Thank you, sir.
I brought some friends
with me.
I see.
Right, right. Um...
This is, um...
Wow. This is
Samuel T. Anders of...
I know who he is.
Damn good to meet you, sir.
Caprica Buccaneers.
That's right.
A hell of a player.
Picon Panther fan myself.
Well,
we enjoy beating them, too.
It's good to have you aboard.
Thank you.
I have news.
Good news, actually.
The Cylon occupation is over.
They left. They're gone.
What are you talking about?
BROTHER CAVlL 2: It's true.
The Cylons have
left the Colonies.
They're headed
for greener pastures.
Security!
What the hell?
Code Blue!
He's a Cylon.
Back off, Chief.
We've got him.
Well, this is
an awkward moment.
Yes, he's right.
I'm a Cylon.
And I have a message.
So, take me to your leader.
Take him to the brig.
Take that to the brig, too.
HELO: What?
Admiral, she didn't know...
Don't even start.
Of course she knew.
Welcome to Galactica.
Why the frak
didn't you say anything?
I don't know.
Maybe I didn't want to.
Or maybe I wanted
him to come here
and blow up the whole ship.
Is that what
you're looking for?
Hmm?
You don't mean that.
Sharon, we'd finally got
the Admiral to start
trusting us.
Finally.
And what?
They killed my baby.
You think I care
about you or us
or whether the Admiral
trusts me anymore?
Hey!
Sharon, I love you!
And I'm not giving up
this frakking easy!
Not after everything!
Are you ready? All right.
Aah!
No, no, no, no, no.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Hey, hey, hey, listen,
you don't have
to get me drunk.
I will sleep with you,
okay?
I figure I owed you one,
what with you saving me
and all.
Little slut.
Shut up.
Now you're gonna
play hard to get.
Yeah.
My hero.
Gods, I guess they'll let
anybody in here these days.
Hey.
Hi.
Welcome back.
Do you want
to meet my man?
Your man?
Hmm.
My personal property.
Right, Sammy?
Don't call me Sammy.
Oh!
How does it feel to be
my personal property?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And before you answer.
He loves it.
I bet he does.
I'm Lee, by the way.
Hey, Samuel.
I'm sorry.
I've heard a lot about you.
Pleasure. A shot?
Sure, why not.
Lee, when are you
gonna get yourself a girl?
I'm doing fine, thank you.
You're not still
frakking Dualla,
are you?
Thanks a lot.
I'm not one to like,
you know, lecture
or anything
'cause I'll do just about
anything to get into the pants
of some hot, little
young thing.
Hey!
Is that all I am to you?
Yes, but you love it.
That's right. I don't mind
doing charity work.
You are a hot, little thing,
but you know that.
Thank you.
Where did he go?
(EXCLAlMS)
I'm here to deliver
a message.
After that, you can do
whatever you want with me.
I don't care.
Would you mind telling me
what's going on?
I'm not a frakking Cylon.
I'm not...
Oh. Well.
Okay, then.
Sorry to bust up
your day, Brother,
but there's been
a change of plans.
It's been decided
that the occupation
of the Colonies was an error.
I could have told them that.
Bad thinking, faulty logic.
Our first major
error of judgment.
Well, live and learn.
But the war heroes
have managed
to swing opinion
over to their side.
What heroes?
A Six and an Eight.
One of the Eights
you know as Sharon Valerii.
Their voices carry
a lot of weight,
so when they started talking
about our mistakes
and our corruption
and our need for
a new beginning,
the rest of us
listened to them.
You see, we're not like you.
We can admit our mistakes,
and we're not afraid
of change.
So you abandoned
the Colonies,
Ieaving behind
a devastated,
nuclear wasteland.
And we're supposed
to be grateful?
Our pursuit of
this fleet of yours
was another error.
That's two, for anyone
who's keeping score.
Both errors led to
the same result.
We became what we beheld.
We became you.
Amen.
People should be true
to who and what they are.
We're machines.
We should be true to that.
Be the best machines
the universe has ever seen.
But we got it into
our heads that we were
the children of humanity.
So, instead of pursuing
our own destiny
of trying to find
our own path to enlightenment,
we hijacked yours.
You said it, Brother.
My mission here
is simple.
I'm to tell you that
you've been given
a reprieve.
Cylon and man
will now go
their separate ways.
No harm done.
No harm?
You completely
annihilated our race
and destroyed
our civilization.
Now, if you're gonna start
pointing fingers...
Where did the Cylons go?
Back to their home world?
Well, I'd rather not
say just now.
Let's just say
we have other plans.
New marching orders
by your one true god?
There is no god.
Supernatural divinities
are the primitive's answer
for why the sun
goes down at night.
At least that's what
we've been telling
the others for years.
We can't really prove it
one way or the other,
of course.
You know a way to prove it?
Throw them both out
the airlock. Let them see if
there really is a Cylon god.
Ballots from the Adriatic.
D?
Right. This way.
MCMANUS: (ON RADlO)
It has been an exciting day.
The election has been
a real rollercoaster ride.
The polls now have
been closed
for about five hours,
results have come in,
and it's been
a see-saw battle,
back and forth between
the presidential candidates.
So, all night long,
as we of course suspected it would be.
We're still waiting
for a few more numbers
to come in now,
from the counting room
of Galactica,
which, I must tell you,
as some of you may know,
was the source of a bit
of a controversy yesterday.
Councilman Zarek
had filed a formal complaint
against the use of military...
The military involvement
in the election process.
Now, it's just reached...
A compromise was just reached
Iate yesterday,
allowing Galactica
to provide security
for the balloting,
as well as
civilians to oversee
and then to monitor
the situation.
Yes, okay.
Now we have some more votes
coming in here.
Still not done,
but what we have so far is
6, 282 more votes for Baltar,
which puts his total now to
21,569.
Is that... Is that correct?
And we also have Roslin.
Her total now is at 17,754.
We've had 2,981 more votes
come in for Roslin
at this time.
So that is how things
are looking at this point.
We'll continue to bring you
up-to-the-minute coverage
as the count progresses.
Yeah, it's me.
Is this a secure line?
Okay.
There are only five ships
left to report in.
We need to move now.
I'll take care of it.
Lieutenant.
I'll be right back.
Are those the ballots
from the Zephyr?
Yes, sir.
All right,
we'll take it from here.
We were told to take these
to the ballot room, sir.
Counting
has already begun.
We'll take it from here.
GAETA: Right there, please.
Last one.
We have some
more results that
have come in here now.
And, uh...
Wow, okay.
8,593 for Roslin,
now, which puts her
over the top.
That's 24,265
for Laura Roslin.
Is that correct?
And 22,366 for Gaius Baltar.
We're gonna check these again
because that has put her
over the top.
She... She has done it.
She has retained
the Presidency
in an improbable comeback
in the final hours
of the campaign.
Again we will, of course,
like to check those numbers
if we could,
but it appears
that Laura Roslin has
retained the Presidency
in defiance of the polls,
the pundits and the purveyors
of gloom and doom.
But I've never seen
a political race
end like this,
but it has just happened.
I'm James McManus.
We'll check those numbers
and we'll get back to you
very shortly. Thank you.
I've seen
a lot of elections, Gaius.
Most honest, a few fixed.
And you can always tell
the fixed ones
because they don't make sense.
And this doesn't make sense.
Laura Roslin is many things,
but she's not corrupt.
And she's not dishonest.
It's over.
Congratulations,
Madam President.
Well, thank you.
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way,
but are you as shocked
as I am?
I'm relieved.
Well, you don't sound it.
I'm just tired.
It's been a long campaign.
Colonel?
May I speak to you
for a moment?
What's up?
Sir, I'm afraid these ballots
from the Zephyr are wrong.
What the hell
are you talking about?
Dr. Baltar's name
is spelled correctly
on these ballots.
But this morning
the Zephyr called me
and told me their ballots
had a misprint.
They misspelled Baltar's
first name.
We didn't have time
to print new ballots,
so I told them on my authority
to go ahead, use them anyway.
Baltar's name is spelled
correctly here.
So they couldn't have come
from the Zephyr.
They're frauds.
Now, there's a complete chain
of custody
from the Zephyr,
all the way into this room.
So someone in the chain
is either the perpetrator
or at least,
a willing ally in...
Thanks for bringing this
to my attention.
I'll take care of it
from here.
Yes, sir.
We should at least notify
the civilian observers
and the press
that these ballots will...
I said I'll take care
of it from here.
Yes, sir.
Madam President,
you should celebrate.
It's a great victory
and you've earned it.
Excuse me.
Admiral, we'll talk later.
Thank you.
Adama.
Yes, sir,
this is Lieutenant Gaeta.
Sir,
I don't know how
to say this...
Fast and straight,
I'd advise.
Yes, sir.
Admiral, I believe
that Colonel Tigh is
involved in a conspiracy
to rig the election
for President Roslin.
When I confronted the Colonel,
he admitted his guilt.
He said he acted in collusion
with your campaign manager,
Tory Foster.
Saul said Tory
had contacted him
a few days ago.
He did it because he felt
that Baltar as president
would be a disaster.
I said I agree,
but that what he had done
was illegal.
A judicial tribunal
may have to be convened.
Stop.
I gave Tory the go ahead.
I didn't know exactly
what she was planning.
I certainly didn't know
about Colonel Tigh.
Oh, my Gods.
But I did know that
she was planning
to fix the vote.
You tried
to steal an election?
Yes, I did.
And I got caught.
But Gaius Baltar
cannot become President
of the Colonies, Bill.
It cannot happen.
Laura,
I don't want him
as President either, but...
He's working
with the Cylons.
I saw him just before
the attack on Caprica
with a copy
of the tall, blonde
Cylon woman.
The same model
who accused Baltar
of treason
before disappearing
from Galactica.
What the hell
are you saying?
Why didn't you
say something before this?
Because I didn't remember
seeing him with that woman
until I remembered it
when I was dying.
I know how that sounds,
but it's real.
The same way Kobol is real
and the Tomb of Athena
is real.
And the map to Earth is real.
Baltar is working
with the Cylons.
Even if that's true,
you have no proof.
No, I don't.
Do we steal the results
of a democratic election
or not?
That's the decision.
Because if we do this,
we're criminals.
Unindicted, maybe,
but criminals just the same.
Yes, we are.
You won't do it.
We've gone this far,
but that's it.
Excuse me?
You try to steal
this election,
you'll die inside.
Likely move your cancer
right to your heart.
People made their choice.
We're gonna have
to live with it.
It's the wrong choice.
Yes, it is.
All right, all right,
all right.
(SlGHlNG)
So, that's it.
We just give it up,
just like that.
The battle perhaps,
but not the war.
Well, the important thing is
the error was discovered
and corrected.
You've been elected President.
Congratulations.
Thank you very much, Admiral.
Now about this error.
Exactly what kind
of a tabulating error
could have occurred
on your ship
that could have swung
several thousand votes
away from me
in favor of your
preferred candidate,
Admiral?
As soon as I have the time,
there will be
an investigation.
I suggest that you
take your victory
and you leave it at that,
Doctor.
I think you'll find
I can be magnanimous
in victory, Admiral.
And I believe
the correct honorific
at this time is
Mr. President Elect.
Set a course
for New Caprica.
Jump completed.
We are in orbit
around New Caprica.
We have all ships present
and accounted for, sir.
Send word to the Pegasus
to launch their initial
ground team onto the surface.
ADAMA: Let's get
a good look
at our new home.
Gods help us all.
Well...
Well...
I think my ability
to see you will no doubt be
constrained
by the responsibilities,
the requirements
of my new position.
Listen to me.
My new position.
But obviously, we...
We will have
the chance to connect,
to get together again
on New Caprica, once...
I'm not going to New Caprica.
What?
What are you talking about?
I'm not going to New Caprica.
We're all going
to New Caprica.
All of us.
Every last,
single one of us.
It's our chance
to be together.
To be together again.
No.
I can't do this anymore.
Stay.
(UNZlPPlNG)
If you'll raise
your right hand
and repeat after me.
"l, Gaius Baltar,
do now avow and affirm."
"l, Gaius Baltar,
do now avow and affirm."
"That I take the office
of the President
"of the 1 2 Colonies

Congratulations,
Mr. President.
WOMAN: Congratulations,
Mr. President.
MAN: Congratulations.
(PEOPLE APPLAUDlNG ON RADlO)
BALTAR: I accept the role
offered to me by the Colonies
with humility and gratitude.
Thank you.
(DEVlCE BEEPlNG)
No, no, no, wait.
And now,
because it was
the first will
of the people,
I am going to sign
my first executive order,
requiring to immediately
establish settlements
on the planet
we have come to know
as New Caprica.
(DEVlCE BEEPlNG)
You have your orders.
(BEEPlNG lNCREASES)
We suspect the warhead
was stolen from your lab,
then smuggled aboard
Cloud Nine by a Cylon agent.
I don't suppose
I could interest you
in a cup of tea, Admiral?
A glass of ambrosia,
biscuit...
Mr. President,
this may be the first step
in a coordinated Cylon attack.
I suggest our first priority
be to focus in on
internal security.
No.
No, I don't think so.
Our first priority
is to the people.
See that they are
safely established
on New Caprica.
Once that's accomplished,
we can put this tragedy
behind us.
You're not listening.
I don't have to listen.
I'm the President.
The settlement begins
and it begins now.
(SlGHlNG)
GAETA: Mr. President?
President Baltar,
good morning, sir.
Good morning, sir.
Oh.
Mr. President,
the union needs their answer.
(GROANlNG)
The union.
If it's not the union,
it's the Quorum.
If it's not the Quorum,
it's the people's council.
(SlGHlNG)
We survived
a nuclear holocaust,
Mr. Gaeta,
and the people complain
about the weather.
Well, sir,
it's hardly the weather...
Well, whatever it is.
How many Cylon attacks
have there been
since I took office?
How many?
None, sir.
None. Precisely.
So why do
the people complain?
Tell the union
to get off their fat asses
and do some frakking work
for a change
or I'll start
rounding up their leaders
and holding them
in detention.
I doubt they'll like
that very much.
I'll tell them,
Mr. President.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Where's my...
Where's my pills?
ADAMA:
I'm telling you to go, okay?
TlGH: No, it's not okay.
I feel like
I'm abandoning my post.
It's time to pack it in,
Saul. You know it.
More than half the crew
is down there
on the ground already.
We can barely put a squadron
in the air to train,
much less fly a decent cap.
We're not really doing
too much up here anymore.
Well, you're staying.
Yeah, well, someone has to
take care of the lighthouse.
Then I'll stay
and take care of it with you.
I appreciate that.
But you know there's only
one person per lighthouse.
We both know the Cylons
could still show up.
Anything's possible.
But we've been orbiting
New Caprica
Ionger than we ran
after the attack.
I don't think
they're coming back anymore.
Colonel,
good luck.
If she gives you
too much trouble,
find yourself a younger one.

Thanks.

Sam, you idiot!
I have been looking
for you everywhere!
What the hell
are you thinking?
Looks like I'm in trouble.
Doc Cottle is here.
You're sick.
You are supposed to be in bed.
I would rather work this
out of my system right here
than lie in bed all day.
Sam, come on.
Come on.
Duty calls.
PLAYER 1: Hey,
you gotta be tough.
(COUGHlNG)

Tomorrow, man.
Same time, same score.

I can't believe
I married a moron.
Are you okay?

I'm fine.
I'm fine.
PLAYER 3: Let's go!
Let's go!
Ah.
STARBUCK:
I'll be right back, okay?
Hey, Doc, wait.
So?
There's fluid in the lungs.
It's probably pneumonia.
So give him something.
I'd love to.
I've been
out of antibiotics
for months.
So what, that's it?
I have a lot of patients
to see,
but he's young
and he's strong.
So, make him rest,
keep him warm
and with a little luck,
he'll make it.
Son of a bitch.
(PEOPLE SHOUTlNG)
TYROL: Please, just calm down.
Everybody listen,
just for a second.
Please. Please. Be quiet!
Hey! Shut the frak up!
When you elected me
union President,
I promised
I would keep us working.
Keep benefits flowing,
but most of all,
keep this city alive...
Colonel!
Hey!
TYROL: I promised
we would stay on the job.
TlGH: Wow, look at you.
Hi.
Oh, I'm so glad
you guys are here.
Me, too.
It's pretty,
pretty exciting.
Yeah, that wears off.
So what's going on here?
President Baltar.
TYROL: Men, women and children
are dependent on our...
Sir, Anders is really sick.
Doc Cottle's giving me
the runaround.
Says there's no antibiotics.
It's a load of crap.
Anything you can do
to help me cut through
the red tape?
You should give Apollo a call.
Pegasus is sitting on
the backup meds.
He'd spring some for you.
Yeah, I doubt that.
That was a long time ago.
People change.
TYROL: Health benefits,
rations and fair compensation.
Yes, we have
a vital responsibility.
Okay.
There comes a time
when you realize
that the engine you've built
with your blood and your sweat
and your tears is being used
for something so foul,
so perverted
that it makes you sick
in your heart.
And it's then
that you must throw
your body on the gears
and on the levers
and on the machine itself
and make it stop.
And we have to show
the people who run it,
the people who control it,
that unless we're free,
that machine will be prevented
from working at all!
ALL: (CHANTlNG) Strike!
Strike! Strike! Strike!
ROSLlN: Okay, everybody
have that so far?
CHlLDREN: Yeah.
Good, you're listening.
Think the President
has a bit of a problem
on his hands.
I also want you
to look at Chapter 10,
it's the history
of the 12 Colonies.
It's really interesting.
The President's problems
are not our problems,
right?
MAYA: That's right.
Our problems are homework
for everyone tonight.

Who is it?
It's for you.
Who is it?
Right.
APOLLO: What do you want?
I need a favor.
Is that right?
I hear that you're hoarding
a bunch of antibiotics
for the pilots.
Where did you hear that?
Anders is sick.
He has pneumonia, Lee.
I think that he might die.
Commander?
Wait one...
Yeah, lieutenant.
What is it?
I'm not sure.
I'm picking up something
on dradis.
Dradis? How can you
see anything in that soup?
I mean...
There it is.
What is it?
Wait, what is that?
Oh, my Gods!
It's a Cylon fleet.
They found us.
They found us.
APOLLO: We have to get
out of here, sir.
We can't just leave
all those people behind.
There's nothing we can do.
It's taking us forever
just to get to action stations
over here.
We're in no shape
for a fight, sir.
They'll be wiped out.
We don't have a choice.
We need to get out of here,
right now!
All decks finally report
condition one, sir.
Should we launch

No.

We're leaving.
But we'll be back.
Start your prep.

Don't you knock?

I am Gaius Baltar,

I know who you are, Gaius.
I know very well.
As long as you offer
no resistance,
you won't be harmed.
How do I know that?
You don't.
You also don't have
any choice.
How did you find us?
Oh, it was
quite by accident, actually.
We were over a light year
away from here
when we detected
the radiation signature
of a nuclear detonation.
Very well.
On behalf of the people
of the 12 Colonies,
I surrender.
What do you want to do now,
Captain?
The same thing we always do.
Fight them until we can't.
And now a moment of Zen,
as we reflect on Season 6.
Oh, my God!
Pay back.
<i>On naît,</i>
<i>on vit,</i>
<i>et on meurt.</i>
<i>On ne peut revenir en arričre.</i>
<i>Pas de deuxičme chance pour bien faire
ce qu'on a raté la premičre fois.</i>
<i>Pas dans cette vie, en tout cas.</i>
<i>Ici le Battlestar Pegasus</i>
<i>au vaisseau déclarant ętre le Galactica.
Répondez.</i>
<i>Le Pegasus ?</i>
Comment est-ce possible ?
Toute la flotte a été détruite.
<i>Amiral Cain.</i>
<i>Nous ne savions pas
qu'il y avait d'autres survivants.</i>
<i>De la part de tous les officiers
et de l'équipage du Pegasus,</i>
bon retour dans la Flotte coloniale.
<i>Ce qu'ils vous ont fait est mal.</i>
<i>Horrible.</i>
Ce dont tu as besoin...
c'est de justice.
<i>Allez vous faire foutre.</i>
<i>Elle est morte avec la certitude que son
vaisseau et son équipage étaient saufs,</i>
et que sa mission avait été accomplie.
Rien ne comptait plus pour elle que son
vaisseau, son équipage et sa mission.
<i>En prenant le commandement du Pegasus,
je jure de respecter ces valeurs,</i>
<i>qui faisaient d'elle un officier
héroďque et efficace.</i>
La nouvelle du meurtre de Fisk
s'est répandue dans toute la flotte.
Un équipage peut craquer
ŕ la mort de son commandant.
Le Pegasus en a perdu deux
en quelques semaines.
Je place Garner aux commandes.
<i>Cdt Garner,
deux vaisseaux mčres sont apparus.</i>
Missiles en approche.
Nous sommes attaqués.
Il faut que le FTL soit bientôt réparé
ou on est morts.
<i>Je dois descendre lŕ-bas.</i>
<i>Monsieur, nous avons perdu Garner.</i>
<i>Il s'est sacrifié
pour sauver le Pegasus.</i>
<i>Garner était mon choix.</i>
<i>Son échec est ma responsabilité.</i>
Félicitations, Commandant.
Le Pegasus est ŕ vous.
<i>Je le disais,</i>
<i>on fait ses propres choix</i>
<i>et on vit avec.</i>
<i>Finalement, on devient ces choix.</i>

APPELÉ LA TERRE
{\pos(192,230)}T'es comme un môme
ŕ son premier jour d'école.
Tu veux me faire regretter
de t'avoir ŕ mes côtés, hein ?
{\pos(192,230)}Autant que possible !
Commandant Lee Adama.
{\pos(192,230)}Merci, Mme la Présidente, Amiral Adama.
{\pos(192,230)}Il y a huit mois, le monde a changé.
Nos vies ont changé ŕ tout jamais.
{\pos(192,230)}<i>Nous avons endossé des responsabilités
que nous ne soupçonnions pas.</i>
<i>Le devoir,</i>
<i>l'honneur,</i>
<i>le service.</i>
<i>Ce sont plus que des mots.</i>
{\pos(192,230)}Ce sont les principes qui guident
ceux qui servent dans l'armée.
{\pos(192,210)}Et récemment,
ils se sont faits rares sur ce vaisseau.
{\pos(192,210)}Ça va changer,
{\pos(192,210)}ŕ compter d'aujourd'hui.
Nous ne pouvons pas choisir
les circonstances,
mais nous choisissons
la façon dont on les gčre.
J'ai l'intention de vous donner
mon maximum,
je n'en attends pas moins en retour.
{\pos(192,210)}J'ai déjŕ nommé Kara Thrace
au poste de CAG.
{\pos(192,210)}J'affecterai d'autres officiers
dans les jours qui viennent.
<i>{\pos(192,210)}Quand je ferai le point sur vos...</i>
{\pos(192,210)}Plus les choses changent,
plus elles restent pareilles, hein Gus ?
{\pos(192,210)}Entrez.
{\pos(192,210)}Lieutenant Kendra Shaw au rapport,
Monsieur.
{\pos(192,210)}Repos, Lieutenant.
{\pos(192,210)}- Asseyez-vous.
- Non, merci.
J'ai l'habitude de rester debout, ici.
{\pos(192,210)}Oui.
{\pos(192,210)}L'amiral Cain
ne raffolait pas des chaises.
{\pos(192,210)}Męme morte, elle reste influente.
Mais je ne vous l'apprends pas.
Monsieur ?
J'ai examiné les rapports d'aptitude
des officiers et...
sincčrement, vous ętes une énigme.
Cain ne tarissait pas d'éloges sur vous.
{\pos(192,210)}Puis une série de rapports
de plus en plus négatifs de Fisk
{\pos(192,210)}et Garner qui vous rétrograde
ŕ la cuisine pour...
"comportement indiscipliné incessant".
La question est :
"Qui ętes-vous ?"
{\pos(78,220)}{\an1}10 MOIS PLUS TÔT
{\pos(192,220)}Kendra Shaw.
Shaw ?
- Votre mčre était donc...
- La déléguée du Quorum, Marta Shaw.
Roulement de tambour, merci.
Elle doit ętre fičre de vous.
Le Pegasus ?
La moitié des officiers de cette base
tueraient pour y ętre affectés.
C'est provisoire.
Je vise l'état-major.
2 ans de baby-sitting de l'amiral Cain,
et je pourrai tirer mon épingle du jeu.
Un plan de carričre
en bonne et due forme.
Disons que je ne me vois pas
passer ma vie sur un Battlestar.
Bonne chance.
<i>Navette pour le chantier de Scorpion,</i>

{\pos(79,220)}{\an1}CHANTIER SPATIAL DE SCORPION
Entrez !
C'est votre idée
de lecture de vacances ?
Et ça ? Votre idée de hobby ?
Tout ŕ fait.
Alors,
vous avez trouvé ce que
vous allez faire de votre permission ?
Je pensais rentrer sur Tauron
voir des amis, mais
je n'ai pas encore de plan arręté.
Pourquoi ne pas passer un peu de temps
avec nous, sur Gemenon ?
Je sais que Rika et les filles
seraient ravies de vous voir.
Allez, Helena, vous méritez une pause.
Vous ętes ŕ plein régime
depuis plus d'un an.
J'ai une liste de réparations
longue comme le bras,
le réseau sera en rade
pour la mise aux normes
et je déteste laisser le Pegasus
ŕ la merci d'entrepreneurs civils.
Écoutez votre XO.
De temps en temps,
il est bon d'échapper aux corvées.
J'y penserai.
- J'y penserai.
- OK.
Helena !
Non ! Helena !
<i>Raptor 1-7-9,
vous ętes autorisé ŕ apponter baie 3.</i>
<i>C'est ŕ vous.</i>
Compris, Pegasus. On y va.
Excusez-moi, vous pourriez m'indiquer...
Excusez-moi, vous pourriez me dire...
- Vous cherchez le CIC ?
- Oui.
Comment vous savez ?
Vous avez le regard abattu du nouveau
qui doit se présenter au rapport.
Un des avantages
d'ętre administrateur réseau.
On est ici.
Vous devez aller lŕ.
Vous me sauvez la vie. Kendra Shaw.
- Gina Inviere.
- Inviere...
C'est l'ancien géminien
pour "résurrection", non ?
Un des avantages d'avoir fait
Lettres classiques.
Vous ne vous doutiez pas
que ça pourrait ętre utile.
- Bienvenue sur le Pegasus, Lieutenant.
- Merci.
Lieutenant Kendra Shaw,
au rapport, Madame.
Votre café était bon, Lieutenant ?
Mon café ?
Dites "oui" pour qu'on ne parte pas
du mauvais pied.
Oui, Madame.
Bien !
Parce que, soit vous vous ętes perdue
en venant au CIC,
soit vous vous ętes arrętée
prendre un café.
Et je préfčre penser que c'était un café
plutôt qu'imaginer ma nouvelle
aide de camp, perdue dans un Battlestar.
- Je viens juste d'arriver...
- Je n'ai pas fini de parler.
Je sais pourquoi vous ętes lŕ.
Vous pensez que ce poste
vous permettra de gravir les échelons.
Laissez-moi deviner. Votre mčre
a fait jouer quelques relations et...
Ma mčre est morte, Madame. D'un cancer.
Oui, je sais. Je lis les journaux.
Et męme si je suis désolée pour vous,
vous feriez mieux de ne plus essayer
de susciter ma compassion.
De vous ŕ moi, je suis encore
plus désolée pour moi.
- Monsieur Hoshi.
- Madame.
Pouvez-vous indiquer ses quartiers
au Lieutenant ?
- Oui, Madame.
- Rompez.
Lieutenant.
- Un petit encas matinal.
- Ouais.
- Je serai dans mes quartiers.
- Oui, Madame.
La beauté d'un réseau,
c'est qu'avec le bon code
on peut contrôler tout le vaisseau,
de n'importe oů.
Le systčme est arręté pour mise ŕ jour.
Mais en cas d'urgence,
on a des sauvegardes.
- Si personne pousse le mauvais bouton.
- Impossible sur le vaisseau de Cain.
Elle est crainte
dans tout le vaisseau, n'est-ce pas...
<i>Ça va ?</i>
Allez, soldat. Levez-vous.
Hoshi !
Suivez-moi au CIC. Allez !
Quand ils seront sortis, fermez le sas
et videz les compartiments.
C'était quoi ?
Les scans indiquent
des détonations atomiques.
- Plusieurs frappes.
- Les Cylons, ça doit ętre eux.
Ils ont rompu l'armistice et lancé
une attaque de grande envergure.
Au moins, on a encore du jus.
Ouais, mais le dradis déconne,
les armes sont débranchées,
on a perdu tous les ordinateurs.
Il faut tout faire en manuel.
Qu'on verrouille tous les sas.
Larguez l'amarrage tribord.
Lieutenant, faites chauffer le FTL.
Oui, Madame.
On se prépare pour un saut d'urgence.
Données sur nav 1.
Insérez la clé de saut.
Madame,
deux missiles viennent droit sur nous.
20 secondes avant impact.
FTL en charge. Sans ordinateur,
pas de saut sécurisé.
Oubliez les calculs. Faites-le.
On sera aveugles, Madame.
On pourrait finir dans un soleil.
- Missiles en approche. 10 secondes.
- On se fout d'oů on saute.
Putain, faites-le, Lieutenant !
FTL pręt.
5 secondes.
Lt, maintenant !
<i>Qui suis-je ?</i>
Je suis un soldat.
Comme l'étaient Fisk et Garner.
Aucun d'eux ne méritait mon respect.
Ils ne l'ont pas eu.
Vous pouvez préciser ?
Fisk faisait du marché noir.
Une ordure, indigne de l'uniforme.
Garner était un despote
qui essayait de diriger ce bâtiment
comme si c'était une machine.
Difficile de vous contredire.
Et moi ?
Ne vous retenez pas
parce que je suis en vie.
Vous ętes un cran au-dessus.
Mais ça n'enlčve rien au fait
que vous ętes un étranger,
placé ici pour nettoyer notre bordel,
ni ŕ l'impression que votre papa
vous a donné un Battlestar
comme s'il vous balançait les clés
d'une nouvelle voiture.
Vous ętes fidčle ŕ votre réputation, Lt.
Donc, vous aimeriez ętre
mon nouveau XO ?
Monsieur ?
Un truc que m'a appris mon pčre,
avant de me balancer les clés,
c'est qu'un commandant a besoin
d'un bon bras droit.
Je dois aussi montrer ŕ cet équipage
que je respecte l'héritage de Cain.
Męme si en vérité, c'est faux.
Je ne suis pas Cain.
Mais je veux rendre sa fierté
ŕ cet équipage.
Donc, je vous laisse porter
son flambeau.
D'accord ?
Dans ce cas, Major,
changez votre uniforme.
Rompez.
10,
9,
8,
7,
6,
5,
4,
3,
2,
1, c'est fini.
- Vous pensez que votre arme est pręte ?
- Oui, Madame.
Vous miseriez votre vie dessus ?
Et celle de vos potes ?
Madame...
Oui, Madame.
Alors, tirez.
Vous ętes sourd, soldat ?
Je vous ai dit de tirer.
Encore.
Je ne pensais pas
trouver un XO plus sévčre que Saul Tigh.
Oui, elle est dure.
- Mais je pense qu'il le fallait.
- Des anicroches ?
Tu sais, elle et Kara
ne s'entendent pas trčs bien.
J'aimerais bien assister au spectacle.
N'oublie pas qu'un XO
n'est pas une massue.
Vous devez former
une équipe basée sur la confiance.
Chacun respecte le travail de l'autre.
Je suppose que c'est un début.
Maintenant que ta maison est en ordre,
j'ai une mission pour toi.
Contre toute raison,
j'ai laissé une équipe scientifique
prendre un Raptor
pour étudier les restes d'une supernova.
Ils ne sont pas rentrés.
Je veux que tu suives leur piste
et que tu les trouves.
Il y a trois civils et deux pilotes.
Et si on rencontre des Cylons ?
C'est une mission de sauvetage.
Ne te lance pas dans une bataille
que tu ne veux pas faire.
Ceci étant dit,
utilise ton jugement.
C'est ton commandement.
{\pos(79,220)}{\an1}MISSION DE SAUVETAGE
DU RAPTOR DISPARU
<i>Rien ŕ ma droite, rien ŕ ma gauche.</i>
J'ai l'impression de perdre mon temps.
<i>Allez, Showboat, chante.
Montre que je suis pas toute seule.</i>
<i>Chanter, Kat ? Tu veux une chanson ?</i>
<i>Pourquoi pas
"99 bouteilles d'Ambroisie" ?</i>
<i>Merde, Showboat.</i>
<i>Ça remonte ŕ loin.</i>
<i>Un bout de chemin.</i>
Merci.
{\pos(192,230)}- Passez-moi le circuit.
- Le voilŕ.
L'infirmerie en a encore perdu 2.
- Ça amčne nos pertes ŕ combien ?
- 723.
C'est plus du quart de l'équipage.
Et nos chasseurs ?
Douze Vipers détruits,
ainsi que deux Raptors.
Et dix-sept vaisseaux
trop endommagés pour ętre réparés.
Quoi d'autre ?
On a maintenu secret ce qu'on a appris
de ComTrafic avant son arręt.
Mais les rumeurs se répandent.
- Il faut des faits, pas des hypothčses.
- D'accord.
Nous sommes ŕ quatre,
peut-ętre cinq sauts des Colonies.
J'imagine que vous ne voulez pas risquer
le vaisseau pour une reco ?
Envoyez deux Raptors,
qu'ils refusent l'engagement.
- Je veux juste des infos.
- Oui, Madame.
Pręt ŕ relancer les systčmes
de navigation et de défense. En attente.
Lieutenant.
Amiral.
Les boucliers, les armes et le FTL
sont opérationnels et je crois savoir
comment ils ont percé nos défenses.
Ces lignes de code du programme
de navigation allaient ętre chargées.
Elles sont destinées
ŕ créer une porte dérobée
qui permet d'accéder
au programme ŕ distance.
Un virus qui affecterait tout le réseau
pourrait s'introduire, c'est ça ?
Par chance,
le nôtre était déjŕ déconnecté,
mais je suggčre de ne pas le rebrancher,
męme aprčs la purge du programme.
Trčs bien, Lieutenant, allez-y.
Vous n'ętes pas aussi inutile
que je le pensais.
- Depuis combien de temps vous ętes lŕ ?
- Je ne sais pas. Je n'ai pas bougé.
Vous devriez vous reposer.
Ça fait deux jours qu'on a été attaqués.
Amiral.
Je suis désolée.
Désolée pour mon comportement,
lors de l'attaque.
J'ai eu peur.
En fait, j'étais terrifiée,
et paralysée.
Vous n'avez plus peur, maintenant ?
- Non.
- Bien.
Cramponnez-vous ŕ votre colčre
et gardez-la.
Elle étouffera votre peur et vous dira
comment agir la prochaine fois.
Lt, boutonnez-vous.
Ici votre Amiral.
Je sais
que beaucoup de rumeurs ont circulé
sur la destruction de nos plančtes
par les Cylons.
<i>J'aimerais vous dire
qu'elles sont exagérées, mais en fait,</i>
<i>elles sont loin de décrire</i>
<i>l'horreur qui s'est abattue sur nous.</i>
La vérité est que
nos colonies ont été détruites,
nos villes bombardées,
et notre flotte a disparu.
<i>Jusqu'ici, rien n'indique
qu'il y ait d'autres survivants.</i>
<i>Je suppose que vous vous posez
la męme question que moi.</i>
Que doit-on faire, maintenant ?
Fuir ?
Nous cacher ?
Ce serait choisir la facilité.
Un philosophe a dit :
"Face ŕ une alternative insoutenable,
il faut tenir compte des impératifs."
Regardez autour de vous.
Nos impératifs sont ici.
Dans nos cloisons,
dans nos chasseurs, dans nos armes,
et en nous-męmes.
La guerre est notre impératif.
Et si, pour l'instant,
la victoire semble impossible,
il y a un autre but ŕ atteindre.
La vengeance.
La riposte.
Nous allons donc nous battre.
Parce qu'au fond, notre ennemi
ne nous laisse pas d'autre choix.
<i>Je veux que ces choses meurtričres</i>
comprennent que tant que
ce vaisseau et son équipage vivront,
la guerre qu'ils ont déclenchée
ne cessera pas.
Merci.
Ainsi soit-il.
Ainsi soit-il.
Ainsi soit-il !
Un relais de com ? Ça ressemble plus
ŕ une sorte d'ouvre-boîte pourri.
Il est gardé
par une demi-douzaine de Raiders.
- C'est tout ?
- Ils ne s'attendent pas ŕ une attaque.
Messieurs, voici notre premičre cible.
Bravo de l'avoir trouvée, Lieutenant.
Merci. J'ai été aidée.
En parlant du loup.
- Bonjour, Gina, bienvenue.
- Bonjour.
Laissez-moi vous présenter
Mademoiselle Gina Inviere.
Mlle Inviere travaille avec le Lt Shaw,
ŕ la mise ŕ jour de nos systčmes.
Avant ça,
elle supervisait la mise ŕ niveau.
Je dois dire qu'elle s'est montrée
trčs utile dans les deux domaines.
Merci.
Voici une trčs belle table.
Merci.
Asseyez-vous, je vous en prie.
Je pense qu'il est important
que nos officiers
se réunissent de temps en temps.
Partager un repas, du bon vin,
de bonnes conversations,
- ça remonte le moral.
- Et c'est le seul moment
oů l'on peut poser nos fesses
sur une chaise.
Maintenant que vous ętes tous lŕ,
j'aimerais prendre un moment
pour dire quelques mots.
En toute sincérité,
j'ai dit des choses,
sous le coup de l'émotion.
Je pensais que l'équipage
avait besoin de les entendre.
Mais je ne veux pas que vous pensiez
un seul instant
que je risquerais des vies
ou des ressources
dans une quęte de vengeance absurde.
Je projette
de mener
une campagne de guérilla totale.
Je veux trouver leurs faiblesses
et je veux les frapper fort.
Comme on dit :
la meilleure défense, c'est l'attaque.
Alors trinquons ŕ l'attaque.
Et allons botter le cul des Cylons !
C'est presque fini.
Je ne vois pas comment sécuriser
ces systčmes avant demain,
sans se les partager.
Et vous ętes la seule
ŕ avoir les codes d'accčs.
On peut demander ŕ l'Amiral
d'augmenter votre accréditation.
Et moi qui croyais
qu'on avait été discrčtes.
C'est difficile
quand on tient vraiment ŕ quelqu'un.
Le programme est chargé.
Vous devez entrer votre code.
Alpha un neuf six gamma un.
Pour satisfaire votre curiosité,
on s'est rencontrées ŕ la présentation
des plans de la mise ŕ niveau.
On a passé beaucoup de temps ensemble
ŕ travailler sur les détails
et par la force des choses...
Vous avez l'air surprise.
Cain semble autosuffisante.
Elle a des besoins, comme nous tous.
Personne ne peut vivre en autarcie.
Croyez-moi, Lieutenant. Finalement,
nous ne sommes que des humains.
<i>Pourquoi pas
"99 bouteilles d'Ambroisie" ?</i>
{\pos(192,220)}<i>- Putain, Showboat. Ça remonte ŕ loin.</i>
- Elle se tait jamais ?
Le bavardage engendre la négligence.
Un mauvais exemple pour les pilotes.
Tant qu'elle reste un exemple
de pilotage, on lui pardonne.
Monsieur ?
Multiples contacts dradis.
Cap 3-9-9, inclinaison 6-2-0.
Taille du chasseur...
- configuration inconnue, Monsieur.
- Des Raiders, forcément.
On a de la compagnie.
Pegasus, ici Starbuck.
D'oů est-ce qu'ils sortent ?
Starbuck, toi et Showboat,
vous rentrez le plus vite possible.
<i>On arrive. Je le sens pas.</i>
<i>Showboat, reste avec moi.</i>
Batteries défensives, tir de précision !
Attention ŕ nos hommes.
Parez ŕ sauter
dčs le retour des oiseaux.
Bien, Monsieur.
Ces vaisseaux...
Je peux presque les voir.
Ils ont quelque chose de bizarre.
On ne devrait pas
lancer les Vipers d'alerte et attaquer ?
- On n'est pas lŕ pour ça, Major.
- Monsieur, qu'est-ce...
Si on repčre le vaisseau,
on ira le chercher.
Sinon, on part d'ici
et on rejoint le Galactica.
Pegasus, ici Starbuck.
On a un problčme avec nos nouveaux amis.
Ils ne veulent pas nous quitter.
Monsieur,
L'équipe FTL indique une panne d'énergie
de l'ordinateur de navigation.
C'est une blague...
Mettez-le sur le générateur de secours.
On a besoin de ces coordonnées.
<i>Ils sont partout.
On ne peut pas se dégager.</i>
Enseigne, feu ŕ volonté
sur toutes les batteries. Courte portée.
Maintenant !
- C'est quoi ce bordel ?
- On est ŕ portée de tir.
<i>Tu déconnes !</i>
OK, tirez dans le tas.
On va se frayer un chemin au canon.
<i>Ça va marcher ?</i>
<i>Non, mais tu te sentiras mieux.</i>
Frak !
Fils de pute.
Bon sang,
c'est comme si elle voulait notre mort.
Écoute, le Major Shaw peut faire
tout ce qu'elle juge nécessaire
- pour protéger ce vaisseau.
- Elle est dangereuse.
Et c'est aussi le XO.
Et franchement, ce tir de barrage
t'a probablement sauvé la peau.
M'en veux pas, si je dis pas "merci".
- Allons, Kara !
- Arręte !
Vous allez m'expliquer
ŕ quoi vous pensiez ?
Jolie démonstration, Capitaine.
Mais vous ne devriez pas
- discuter mes choix tactiques.
- Choix tactiques ?
C'est comme ça que vous appelez
"tirer sur ses pilotes".
Mauvaise idée,
de contester les ordres sur ce vaisseau,
Capitaine !
{\pos(192,220)}- Combien de Raiders, Lt ?
- 12 signatures.
Plus que prévu.
Un escadron devrait pouvoir s'en charger
et détruire la cible.
Lancez l'escadron Blue.
Nouveaux contacts.
C'est quoi ce bordel ?
Il y a beaucoup de brouillage,
mais je détecte 15 escadrons de Raiders.
Ils ont dű arriver
juste aprčs le lancement des nôtres.
C'est pas un relais de com.
C'est une plateforme de ravitaillement.
On rappelle nos Vipers ?
Deux minutes avant contact.
Les Cylons nous attendaient.
On doit récupérer les Vipers
et sauter, tant qu'on le peut.
Non.
Faites décoller la réserve.
Qu'ils couvrent Blue,
pendant qu'ils attaquent la cible.
Ils seront ŕ 4 contre 1.
Un escadron de Raiders
a rompu la formation et s'approche.
Activez les batteries de défense.
Elles ne répondent pas.
Notre réseau défensif
nous refuse l'accčs.
Que les artilleurs
passent en contrôle manuel.
Amiral,
nous sommes surpassés en nombre
et notre réseau défensif est bloqué.
C'est un pičge,
quelle autre preuve vous faut-il ?
Raison de plus
pour lancer tout ce qu'on a.
C'est exactement
ce que vous ne vouliez pas faire.
Męme si on réussit,
est-ce que ce relais vaut les vies
et les chasseurs qui sont en jeu ?
Monsieur Belzen,
vous refusez d'exécuter mon ordre ?
Amiral,
en conscience, je ne peux pas obéir.
M. Belzen, donnez-moi votre arme.
- Amiral ?
- J'ai dit : "Donnez-moi votre arme."
Vite !
Mes Dieux !
Colonel Fisk !
Vous ętes mon XO, désormais.
Mon ordre est toujours valable.
Voulez-vous l'exécuter ?
Ici, le XO.
Lancez tous les escadrons.
Amiral, les sas bâbord
4, 10 et 12 ont été activés.
Nous sommes abordés par les Cylons.
Colonel,
envoyez les groupes de défense rapides.
<i>- Ŕ tout l'équipage, repoussez...</i>
- Lt, allez au Contrôle d'avarie n°2.
Ils vont essayer de nous asphyxier,
avant qu'on ait une chance de riposter.
Ŕ vos ordres.
Allez !
Ils viennent par lŕ,
en tuant tout le monde.
Réfugiez-vous au CIC.
Putain, c'est quoi ?
Vous ! Écartez-vous de l'amiral.
- Lieutenant ?
- J'ai dit : "Écartez-vous de l'amiral."
Tout de suite !
Vous deux, enfermez-la.
Contrordre. Lt, qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Elle nous aide
avec le réseau de défense.
Non, Amiral. C'est un espion cylon
qui a notre apparence.
Par pitié !
Monsieur Hoshi,
pourriez-vous afficher
le flux vidéo du sas 4 ?
C'est du délire.
Je sais pas ce qu'elle s'imagine.
Mes Dieux !
- Virez cette chose de mon pont.
- Ŕ vos ordres.
Agissez comme de vrais officiers,
bon sang !
Vous vous donnez en spectacle.
D'oů peuvent-ils bien venir ?
Ça fait un moment que j'en ai pas vu
en dehors d'un musée.
Et tu dis
qu'une flotte entičre est arrivée ?
Sortie de nulle part.
Tu dois trouver ça troublant.
Qu'est-ce qui te fait dire ça ?
Ça ne doit pas te faire plaisir,
d'ętre confrontée ŕ la preuve
qu'il n'y a pas si longtemps,
ton peuple ressemblait vraiment
ŕ de l'électroménager.
Ces modčles servaient un objectif vital.
Ils nous ont libérés
de l'oppresseur humain.
Et une fois ce louable objectif atteint,
vous avez choisi de ressembler
encore plus ŕ ces oppresseurs.
Dieu a fait l'homme ŕ son image.
Pourquoi les enfants de l'humanité
devraient-ils ignorer leur dette
envers le créateur supręme ?
En outre,
ces corps nous permettent d'apprécier
sa création dans toute sa splendeur.
Amen.
Pourquoi les Cylons ressusciteraient
une machine totalement obsolčte
selon leurs critčres ?
Peut-ętre qu'ils ne l'ont pas fait.
Peut-ętre qu'ils étaient lŕ,
depuis toujours.
Vous savez quelque chose ?
Nos bases de données mentionnent
un groupe de Centurions,
appelés les Gardiens.
Des vieux modčles,
qui ont échappé ŕ la casse.
De quoi sont-ils les gardiens ?
D'un hybride.
Une entité qui représente
le premier pas dans notre évolution
de pures machines ŕ des ętres de chair.
De eux,
ŕ nous.
Le chaînon manquant cylon.
Non, plutôt une impasse de l'évolution.
Des hybrides ont été créés
pour contrôler nos vaisseaux
avant l'abandon de l'expérience, mais...
c'était le premier.
Et...
certains pensent qu'il vit toujours.
Protégé par ces Gardiens.
Et qu'il cherche toujours
sa propre voie pour évoluer.
Lors de la derničre opération
de la guerre,
le Galactica faisait partie
d'une force opérationnelle
qui a détruit une base cylon.
J'étais sur cette mission.
Les Cylons étaient supposés construire
une super arme.

<i>Je l'ai, Banzai.</i>
<i>Vire ŕ gauche, au signal.</i>
<i>Maintenant ! Vire, vire !</i>
<i>Husker, ici Banzai.
Suis-moi, on rejoint l'escadron.</i>
<i>Banzai, ici Husker.
Les défenses du Columbia sont mortes.</i>
<i>Ŕ tous les Vipers, ici Banzai.</i>
<i>Le Columbia a besoin d'aide.
On va dégager tout ça.</i>
<i>Husk ! Ŕ 9 heures.
Il y en a 2 vers la défense centrale.</i>
<i>Bandit ŕ 2 heures, au-dessus.
Faites demi-tour.</i>
<i>On est derričre eux. Juste derričre !</i>
<i>Confirmation.</i>
<i>Vire ŕ gauche. Je l'ai, je l'ai.</i>

<i>Cet enfoiré est ŕ moi.</i>
<i>Humain 1, toasteur 0.</i>
<i>Ŕ tous, dégagez la zone du Columbia.</i>
<i>Ŕ tous, dégagez. Tout de suite, putain.</i>
<i>Par les Dieux !
Le Columbia est détruit !</i>
Dieux.
J'ai 2 bandits qui s'échappent.
Husker, en poursuite.
T'es fou, le bleu ? En formation.
Pas le moment de la jouer solo.
Joue pas au héros, Adama !
Touché !
T'es oů, petit enfoiré ?
Allez, viens !
Viens, fils de pute !
Merde.
<i>Tout ceci est déjŕ arrivé.</i>
<i>Et se produira encore.</i>
Il y a quelqu'un ?
Ŕ l'aide.
Aidez-nous, ils nous ont laissés lŕ.
Ne nous abandonnez pas.
Je vais vous sortir de lŕ.
Nous sommes des civils,
des commerçants de Gemenon. Nous...
Ils ont attaqué notre convoi, détruit
notre escorte et nous ont capturés.
On était 50, mais ils nous ont emmenés
les uns aprčs les autres.
On pouvait les entendre crier.
On sait pas ce qui leur est arrivé.
S'il vous plaît, sortez-nous d'ici.
J'essaie.
La porte doit ętre soudée.
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- Je ne sais pas.
On dirait un tremblement de terre.
Ça commence ŕ s'effondrer.
J'ai réussi !
C'est coincé.
Je ne peux pas l'ouvrir plus.
Partez. Allez chercher de l'aide.
Je reste avec vous.
Non, vous n'y arriverez pas seul.
Partez !
Racontez notre histoire.
Notre vaisseau s'appelait le Diana.
De Gemenon, OK ? Dites-leur.
Si vous restez,
vous serez prisonnier comme nous.
Allez-y !
Partez !
Sauvez-vous !
Allez-y !
Galactica, Husker.
Galactica, ici Husker. Vous me recevez ?
<i>Husker, bien reçu. Votre situation ?</i>
Je me suis écrasé ŕ la surface.
Ils faisaient quelque chose ici,
en expérimentant sur des gens.
Et maintenant, ils partent
avec ce qu'ils ont fabriqué.
<i>Husker, la guerre est finie !</i>
Quoi ?
Galactica, répétez !
<i>La guerre est finie.</i>
<i>L'armistice vient d'ętre signé.</i>
<i>Activez votre balise,
on vous envoie des secours.</i>
<i>Husker, répondez.</i>
<i>Ils se sont échappés avec,</i>
juste avant de signer l'armistice.
Si cet hybride vit toujours,
et qu'il a capturé certains des nôtres.
Je ne veux męme pas y penser.
Baltar et Tyrol ont réussi
ŕ démonter l'ordinateur du Raider
et ŕ extraire sa navigation,
puis ŕ extrapoler
la localisation possible d'une base.
Sans doute plutôt un vaisseau mčre.
C'est lŕ que doit se trouver
notre équipage.
C'est ŕ 2 ou 3 sauts
de lŕ oů vous avez été attaqués.
Je disais au commandant que nous
ne pouvons risquer les deux Battlestars.
Donc, je transfčre provisoirement
mon pavillon sur le Pegasus.
- Tu nous accompagnes ?
- Tu gardes le commandement.
Disons que j'ai un intéręt personnel
dans cette mission.
Une mission basée sur une légende cylon.
Ce n'est pas une légende, fils.
J'ai vu l'endroit
oů ils ont fabriqué cette chose.
J'ai vu comment ils l'ont créée.
Nous ne laisserons pas ça se reproduire.
Pas aux nôtres.
Je vais dire ŕ mon XO
de préparer un plan d'attaque.
J'ai bien peur
que ça nous amčne ŕ un autre sujet,
Commandant.
La clé est de les leurrer.
Le Pegasus saute
en plein coeur de l'essaim,
il est assailli par une nuée de Raiders.
On leur fait croire
qu'ils ont endommagé notre FTL
avant de fuir ŕ vitesse subluminique,
en les entraînant derričre nous.
C'est lŕ que mon équipe d'assaut arrive.
C'est un plan trčs risqué,
mais vous le savez.
C'est une mission de sauvetage.
Montez ŕ bord, trouvez les nôtres,
posez la bombe, et rentrez entiers.
- Qui pilote le Raptor ?
- Le capitaine Thrace.
C'est la seule en qui j'ai confiance.
La question est de savoir
si je peux avoir confiance en vous.
La Présidente pense
qu'ŕ l'époque de l'amiral Cain
vous avez été impliquée dans un incident
ŕ bord d'un vaisseau civil.
Le Scylla.
Un incident qui a vu l'exécution
de dix personnes. C'est exact ?
<i>Est-ce exact ?</i>
J'y étais.
Ça suffit pour m'incriminer.
Pourquoi ne m'avoir rien dit ?
Vous vouliez passer
un message ŕ l'équipage de ce vaisseau,
que vous respectiez l'héritage de Cain.
Je suis son héritage.
Je suis en vie, grâce ŕ ses choix.
Comme tout le monde sur ce vaisseau.
Autre chose ?
Cain n'aurait pas hésité une seconde
pour ce plan.
Elle savait
qu'on ne gagne pas de bataille,
encore moins une guerre,
sans risquer de vie.
Vous avez fini ?
Oui, Monsieur.
Si vous voulez ma démission,
je vous la donne.
Ça serait plus facile, n'est-ce pas ?
Vous retourneriez éplucher des patates,
en vous apitoyant
parce que la pauvre Kendra Shaw
est le seul officier de la flotte
qui a dű faire un choix difficile.
Ça n'arrivera pas, Major.
Pas sous mon commandement.
Ce plan est risqué,
mais pour l'instant, je n'ai que vous.
Remplissez votre mission, Major.
Votre plan est approuvé.
<i>Petrius, ici l'Adriatic,</i>
<i>j'ai une autre cargaison de déchets
dans la soute.</i>
<i>Petrius, ici l'Adriatic.
J'ai une autre...</i>

LES SUITES DE L'ATTAQUE DE LA STATION
Le rapport final indique
816 morts, 121 blessés.
32 Vipers détruits, 61 trčs endommagés.
Selon le chef, nous n'avons pas
assez de pičces pour les réparer tous.
C'est cher payé
pour une victoire insignifiante.
Je ne dirais pas ça, Madame.
Je dirais qu'on a prévenu l'ennemi.
Le prix payé est de ma faute.
Comment ça, Lieutenant ?
J'ai donné mes codes d'accčs ŕ cette...
Elle a dű les utiliser
pour passer nos sécurités.
Non, vous lui avez donné
bien plus important.
Votre confiance,
comme moi. Mais cette chose
sait vraiment manipuler
les émotions humaines,
les influencer.
Lieutenant Thorne,
je veux que vous interrogiez
notre prisonničre.
Trouvez tout ce qu'elle sait.
Puisqu'elle est si douée
pour imiter les émotions humaines,
je suppose que son programme
y est aussi vulnérable, donc...
La douleur, bien sűr.
L'humiliation,
la peur,
la honte.
Je veux que vous testiez
vraiment ses limites.
Soyez aussi créatif que nécessaire.
Oui, Madame.
<i>Lieutenant Thorne. Accčs autorisé.</i>
<i>L'amiral Cain pour le CIC.</i>
Lieutenant, suivez-moi.
Colonel, la situation ?
Nous venons de détecter une flotte
qui émet un signal colonial.
Madame,
ce sont des civils.
- Une flotte de civils.
- 15 vaisseaux, Madame.
La CAP est partie les intercepter.
Lieutenant, contactez
les capitaines de ces vaisseaux.
Demandez-leur d'envoyer leur manifeste
ainsi que leurs plans et l'inventaire
de leurs armes et pičces de rechange.
Oui, Madame.
Colonel, je veux que vous envoyiez
des équipes d'ingénieurs et de marines
ŕ bord de chaque vaisseau.
Madame, allons-nous...
Nous allons leur prendre
tout ce qu'il nous faut.
Quand ils le réaliseront,
ils résisteront sans doute.
Nous devons donc agir
vite et avec détermination.
Colonel, si ça vous pose problčme,
dites-le maintenant.
Non.
Au travail.
Permission de monter ŕ bord ?
Permission accordée. Bienvenue.
Nous avons prié pour ce miracle.
Quand les Cylons nous ont trouvés,
nous avons perdu 4 vaisseaux,
mais Dieux merci, vous ętes lŕ.
M. Laird, l'amiral Cain
m'a ordonné de vous donner ceci.
- Et c'est ?
- Une liste du matériel
et des passagers ŕ transférer
sur le Pegasus. Immédiatement.
Votre nom est sur la liste.
Mon nom ?
Attendez. Vous voulez prendre
nos moteurs FTL.
On sera sans défense.
Comme je l'ai dit, certains des vôtres
viennent grossir notre équipage.
Donc...
vous allez décider aussi facilement
qui vit ou meurt ?
Nous faisons ce que nous pouvons,
mais vous devez comprendre.
Nous sommes en guerre.
Les besoins militaires
sont prioritaires.
Je ne comprends pas. Ils...
Ils vont prendre ce qu'ils veulent
et nous laisser nous débrouiller seuls.
Vous pouvez pas faire ça.
- Vous pouvez pas.
- Non.
Écoutez !
Vous tous !
Nous avons l'ordre
de transférer l'équipage
et les équipements
de cette liste, sur le Pegasus.
Nous ne voulons blesser personne
mais nous userons
de la force si nécessaire.
Non.
Vous ne pouvez pas faire ça.
Vous pouvez pas.
- Reculez !
- Vous devez nous aider.
Vous ne pouvez pas faire ça !
<i>Appel intercom du colonel Fisk.</i>
<i>Qu'y a-t-il, Colonel ?
Vous ętes déjŕ en retard.</i>
Madame, ils nous bloquent l'accčs

Il n'y a pas que des individus,
Madame. Ce sont

Dites-leur que vous tuerez les familles

<i>Amiral, je vous ai bien entendue ?</i>

On dirait qu'on essaie toutes les deux

C'est bien.
J'aimerais pas que le nouvel XO

J'aimerais pas que le pilote favori

Parfois, nous devons faire des choses
dont on ne se serait jamais cru capable,
ne serait-ce que pour montrer
sa volonté ŕ l'ennemi.
Hier, vous m'avez montré
que vous étiez capable
de mettre de côté votre peur,
vos hésitations,
et męme votre répulsion,
toutes les inhibitions qui,
lors d'une bataille,
peuvent faire la différence
entre vie et mort.
Quand vous pouvez ętre ainsi

alors vous ętes une lame de rasoir.
Cette guerre
nous force tous
ŕ devenir des lames de rasoir,

MISSION DE SECOURS ET DE SAUVETAGE
Le Chef dit
qu'il a déjŕ vérifié nos modifs.
Il m'a dit la męme chose.
"Espčre le meilleur, prévois le pire."
Comme le disait
mon sergent-major de mčre.
C'est tout ce qu'elle vous disait ?
"La peur est fatale,
la colčre te garde en vie."
L'amiral Cain disait la męme chose.
Elle m'a dit une fois,
"Quand vous pouvez ętre ainsi
"aussi longtemps que nécessaire,
"alors vous ętes une lame de rasoir."
Une arme ne ressent pas la peur.
Elle n'a aucun regret.
Elle existe, c'est tout.
Ces deux-lŕ se seraient bien entendues.
Bien sűr,
ma mčre racontait pas mal de conneries.
Elle s'accrochait tellement ŕ sa colčre,
qu'ŕ la fin, il lui restait plus que ça.
Elle est morte seule.
Ŕ mon avis, la peur, la colčre
sont les deux faces d'une męme pičce.
Faut laisser filer les deux.
Vous me passez la clé ŕ molette ?
<i>Condition 1 dans tout le vaisseau.</i>
<i>Équipes d'assaut

Brčches ŕ bâbord.
Pont 4, zones 12 ŕ 14.

Ça suffit.
Déconnectez le FTL.
Amenez-nous cap...

Ils nous suivent.
Espérons qu'ils continuent.
<i>On dirait qu'ils ont gobé.</i>
<i>Maintenant,
on va récupérer l'équipage du Raptor.</i>
Ça sera peut-ętre plus facile
qu'on pensait.
Tout faux. Deux ennemis en approche.
C'est parti !
<i>Pręts ?</i>
Allez !
Cible ennemie détruite.
Que toutes les ailes se regroupent
et reprennent la poursuite du Pegasus.
Ŕ vos ordres.
Gunny, au rapport.
Équipe Red au complet.
Parle pour toi, Sergent. Je compte
encore mes doigts et mes orteils.
La ferme, Hudson.
Équipe Red, en formation derričre moi.
C'est pas merveilleux
quand un plan fonctionne ?
Équipe Red, ŕ mon signal,
allumez les propulseurs.
Ils viennent enfin pour moi.
Je sens leur vie,
leur destinée se révéler ŕ moi.
Le déni de la vraie voie,
qui a fait son temps
dans un monde qui n'est pas le leur,
se terminera bien assez tôt.
<i>Red 1 au Pegasus.</i>
Red 1, ici Pegasus. Donnez le statut
de votre mission et de votre équipe.
<i>On y est. On est entrés par le sas
d'une des armes périphériques.</i>
<i>On avance vers le noyau.
Pas de contacts, pas de pertes.</i>
<i>Restez prudents, les enfants.</i>
<i>Qui sait combien de toasteurs
sont restés pour garder la maison.</i>
La ferme, Hudson. On aura
peut-ętre pas besoin de le découvrir.
Que dit le détecteur de chaleur ?
<i>J'ai une source. Peut-ętre biologique.</i>
<i>Prčs du noyau, mais c'est tout.</i>
<i>Attendez,
j'ai au moins trois autres signatures.</i>
<i>Deux d'entre elles sont trčs faibles,
mais ça vient de 30 mčtres devant.</i>
<i>Peut-ętre nos hommes. Gunny, va voir.</i>
Bientôt, ils seront quatre,

Luttant pour la connaissance
de leur vrai moi.
La douleur de la révélation
amenant une nouvelle clarté.
Et en pleine confusion, il la trouvera,
des ennemis
rassemblés par un désir impossible,
des ennemis qui ne font qu'un.
La voie qui les attend
ŕ la fois incroyable,
et inévitable.
Et le cinquičme,
encore dans l'ombre,
s'avancera dans la lumičre,
avide de rédemption,
qui ne viendra que dans le hurlement
d'une souffrance terrible.
Je les vois tous.
Les sept,
maintenant six, se présentant
comme des machines
qui se croient sans péchés.
Mais avec le temps,
c'est le péché qui les consumera.
Ils connaîtront l'hostilité,
le ressentiment,
l'agonie déchirante
de celui qui vole en éclats.
Puis ils atteindront la terre promise,
rassemblés sur les ailes d'un ange.
Pas une fin,
mais un commencement.
- Putains de Dieux.
- Sortez-les d'ici, vite !
Aidez-nous.
Sortez-les d'ici, allez !

<i>Ce fut un honneur, Capitaine.</i>
<i>Venez, Major.

Vous avez peur, petit enfoiré ?
Vous devriez.
Tout ceci est déjŕ arrivé.

Vous vouliez me voir, Amiral.
Merci d'ętre venu.
Starbuck était ici, il y a peu.
Elle a recommandé le Major Shaw
pour une décoration posthume.
Elle ne courait pas aprčs les médailles.
Non.
Mais j'ai épluché les rapports de Cain,
et du point de vue tactique,
il est difficile de trouver
une faute dans ce qu'elle a fait,
ou que Kendra a fait.
Ils ont massacré des civils, Papa.
Allons.
Comment peux-tu ignorer ça ?
Je n'ai pas vécu
la męme situation qu'elle.
J'avais la Présidente en face de moi,
défendant la cause de la flotte civile.
J'avais Tigh, préservant mon honnęteté,
en équilibrant
ma moralité et mes tactiques.
Et je t'avais, toi.
Maintenant...
tu n'as pas d'enfant,
donc tu peux ne pas comprendre ceci,
mais tu vois ton reflet dans leurs yeux.
Il y a des choses
que je pensais faire avec cette flotte,
mais j'ai renoncé car je savais
que je devrais
te regarder en face aprčs.
Si tu n'avais pas été au CIC,
j'aurais ordonné cette frappe.
Kara serait morte,
ainsi que le reste de l'équipe.
Tu n'as rien fait de mal,
moi non plus.
Nous avons pris les décisions requises,
pour accomplir notre mission.
Oui.
Cain.
Kendra.
Avaient-elles tort ?
Si je croyais aux Dieux,
je dirais qu'elles seront jugées
par une puissance supérieure.
Mais comme tu ne crois pas...
Alors l'histoire devra juger.
Et comme le brouillon de l'histoire
sera écrit dans nos rapports...
Alors, je suppose
que j'ai des choses ŕ écrire.
Pense ŕ cette citation.
Oui, j'y penserai.
Pas grand-chose ŕ montrer
pour une vie, hein ?
Je suppose.
Tu sais pourquoi elle a fait ça ?
Elle pensait peut-ętre
avoir beaucoup ŕ se faire pardonner.
Peut-ętre qu'elle le méritait.
On le mérite tous...
Autant que je te le dise moi-męme.
J'ai demandé ŕ ętre réaffectée
sur le Galactica.
Pourquoi ?
Disons que j'ai une dent
contre mon supérieur.
Et pourquoi ?
Cet enfoiré essaie de me faire tuer.
Tu penses pas que tu le mérites ?
Parle pour toi, Lee. J'ai...
une destinée.
Un Cylon l'a lu dans ma main,
tu t'en souviens ?
Une destinée ?
Tu ferais mieux d'y croire.
Donc, j'imagine
que tu es coincé avec moi,
jusqu'ŕ la fin.
Je dois aller dresser ton nouveau CAG,
Monsieur.
<i>You're born,</i>
<i>you live</i>
<i>and you die.</i>
<i>There are not do-overs.</i>
<i>No second chances to make things right
if you frak them up the first time.</i>
<i>Not in this life, anyway.</i>
<i>This is the Battlestar Pegasus</i>
<i>to the ship claiming to be
the Galactica. Please respond.</i>
<i>Pegasus?</i>
How could that be?
The entire fleet was destroyed.
<i>Admiral Cain,</i>
<i>we had no idea
there were other survivors.</i>
<i>On behalf of the officers and the crew
of the Pegasus,</i>
welcome back to the colonial fleet.
<i>What they did to you was wrong.</i>
<i>Evil.</i>
What you need...
is justice.
<i>Frak you.</i>
<i>And she died knowing that her ship
and her crew were safe</i>
and that her mission
had been accomplished.
Nothing was more important to her than
her ship, her crew, and her mission.
<i>And as I take command of Pegasus,
I pledge to uphold those values</i>
<i>that made her such an effective</i>
<i>and heroic leader.</i>
Word of Fisk's murder is
spread out through the entire fleet.
Crew can fall apart
when their commander is killed.
Pegasus lost two in a matter of weeks.
I'm putting Garner in command.
Commander Garner,
two Baseships just jumped in.
Nukes inbound. We're under attack.
We need those FTLs fixed soon.
Or we're dead.
<i>I need to go down there.</i>
<i>Sir,</i>
<i>we've lost Garner.</i>
<i>He sacrificed himself
to save the Pegasus.</i>
<i>Garner was my decision.</i>
<i>His failure's my responsibility.</i>
Congratulations, Commander.
The Pegasus is your command.
<i>Like I said,</i>
<i>you make your choices</i>
<i>and you live with them.</i>
<i>And in the end, you are those choices.</i>

Linwelin, NikoMagnus
I swear you're like a kid
on his first day of school.
You're gonna make me regret
having you along, aren't you?
Every chance I get.
Commander Lee Adama.
Thank you Madam President,
Admiral Adama.
Eight months ago, the world changed.
Our lives changed forever.
<i>We found ourselves
shouldering responsibilities</i>
<i>we never thought we'd have.</i>
<i>Duty,</i>
<i>honor,</i>
<i>service.</i>
<i>They're more than words.</i>
Those are the guiding principles
for those who serve in the military.
And recently all have been
in short supply on this ship.
That's gonna change,
beginning today.
We can't always choose our circumstances
but we can choose how we handle them.
I intend to give you my all,
I expect nothing less in return.
I've already appointed Kara Thrace
as my acting CAG,
I'll be making other officer
and duty assignments in the coming days.
<i>As I review your...</i>
The more things change,
the more they stay the same, Gus.
Come in.
Lieutenant Kendra Shaw
reporting as ordered, Sir.
At ease, Lieutenant.
- Have a sit.
- No, thank you.
Frankly,
I'm used to standing in this room.
Yeah.
Admiral Cain
apparently wasn't big on chairs.
Even dead, the woman casts a shadow.
But I'm sure
I don't have to tell you that.
Sir?
I've been reviewing the Fitreps
for the ship's officers and...
frankly, you're a puzzle.
Top ratings from Cain,
clearly thought the world of you.
Then a whole series of increasingly
negative reports from Fisk,
then Garner
who demoted you to kitchen duty for...
"persistent insubordinate behaviour".
So, the question is: who are you?
<i>Raptor 1-7-9,
you're cleared for docking bay 3.</i>
<i>Call the ball.</i>
Roger that, Pegasus. We have the ball.
Come in!
That's your idea of vacation readings?
What is that? Your idea of a hobby?
Yeah, it is.
So,
have you figured out
how you're gonna spend your shore leave?
I was thinking about maybe going home
to Tauron to visit some friends but
I have'nt made
any definite plans yet, no.
In that case, how about
spending some time with us on Gemenon?
I know Rika and the girls
would love to see you.
Come on, Helena. You deserve a break.
You're going full tilt
for over a year now.
I've got a repair list as long as
my arm plus our network's gonna be down
for the retrofit and you know
I don't like leaving Pegasus
at the mercy
of civilian contractors, so...
All right, listen to your XO.
Once in a while,
it's OK to get off the treadmill.
I will think about it.
- I'll think about it.
- OK.
Excuse me,
could you please point me towards...
Excuse me, could you please show me...
- Looking for the CIC?
- Yes.
How did you know?
You've got that new officer meaning
to report to her CO look down cold.
One of the benefits of
being a network administrator.
This is us.
This is where you need to be.
You're a livesaver. Kendra Shaw.
- Gina Inviere.
- Inviere...
That's old Gemenese
for "resurrection", isn't it?
One of the benefits of
being a lapsed classics major.
Guess you never know when something
like that might coming handy?
- Welcome to Pegasus, Lieutenant.
- Thank you.
Lieutenant Kendra Shaw,
reporting for duty, Sir.
Did you enjoy your coffee, Lieutenant?
My coffee?
Just say yes
so we don't get off on the wrong foot.
Yes, Sir.
Good!
You see, because I figured that
you either got lost on your way to CIC,
or you stopped for a cup of coffee and
frankly, I'd rather think
it was a cup of coffee
than realize my new aide can't
find her way around a Battlestar.
- Sir, I've just arrived...
- I'm not finished speaking.
I know why you're here.
You're here because you think this job
is a stepping stone to a better one.
So, let me guess. You had your mother
pull some strings. And she...
My mother's dead, Sir.
She died of cancer.
Yes, I know. I read the papers.
And while I'm very sorry for your loss,
you'd be well advised to make that
the last time you play on my sympathies.
Between you and me, I'm feeling
a hell of a lot sorrier for myself.
- Mister Hoshi.
- Sir.
Can you please direct this lieutenant
to her quarters?
- Yes, Sir.
- You're dismissed.
Lieutenant.
- A little mid-morning snack.
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna be in my quarters.
- Yes, Sir.
Beauty of a network system is
that with the right passcode
you can control just about
any part of the ship from any other.
Of course the system's down
for the retrofit,
but in emergency,
it's like having unlimited backups.
Assuming no one hits the wrong button.
Yeah, not on Cain's ship.
Puts the fear of the Gods
into everyone, does she?
<i>Are you OK?</i>
Come on, soldier. Get up. On your feet.
Hoshi!
Follow me to CIC. Come on!
Soon as your men are out, seal the hatch
and vent the compartments.
What the hell hit us?
Radiological reading
looks like nuclear detonation.
- Multiple hits.
- It's the Cylons. It has to be.
But they've broken the armistice
and this is part of an all-out attack.
At least, we still have our power.
But that's about it, dradis is erratic,
weapons are offline,
same with all our computers.
We have to do everything manually.
I want all hatches sealed.
Docking connections severed.
Lieutenant, spin up our FTL drive.
Yes, Sir.
We're preparing
for an emergency jump, everyone.
Set preload on nav 1. Insert jump key.
Sir, two more nukes
head straight for us.
Estimate 20 seconds to impact.
FTL spooling, Sir. But without computer,
we can't calculate a safe jump.
Don't bother calculating. Just do it.
You wanna do a blind jump, Sir.
We might en up inside a sun.
- Missiles closing. Ten seconds.
- It doesn't matter where we jump to.
Just frakking do it, Lieutenant!
FTL online.
5 seconds.
Lieutenant, now!
<i>Who am I?</i>
I'm a soldier. As were Fisk and Garner.
Neither of those men deserve my respect,
so they didn't get it.
Can you be more specific?
Fisk was a black market sell-out.
He was a piece of garbage,
unworthy of the uniform.
Garner was a martinet.
who tried to micro-manage this ship like
it was some bulky piece of machinery.
Hard to dispute either assessment.
What about me?
Don't hold back
just because I've got a pulse.
You're a step up.
But that doesn't change the fact
that you're an outsider
who was brought in to clean up our mess,
or the impression that your daddy
just gave you a Battlestar,
like he was tossing you the keys
to a new car.
You certainly don't disappoint,
Lieutenant.
So, how would you like to be my new XO?
Sir?
One thing I learned from my father,
before he tossed me the keys
is that a commander needs
a strong right arm.
I also need to send a message to
this crew, that I respect Cain's legacy.
Even if the truth is that I don't.
I'm no Cain.
But I intend to give this crew
their pride back.
So, I'll let you carry her torch.
Deal?
In that case, Major,
you out of uniform.
Dismissed.
10,
9,
8,
7,
6,
5,
4,
3,
2,
1, you're done.
- You think that weapon's ready to fire?
- Yes, Sir.
You're ready to bet your life on that?
The lives of all your buddies?
Sir...
Yes, Sir.
Then fire your weapon.
Are you deaf, soldier?
I said fire your frakkin' weapon.
Again.
Didn't think it possible
that you could find an XO meaner
than Saul Tigh.
Yeah, she's tough.
- But I think we needed tough.
- Any ruffled feathers?
You know,
she and Kara don't exactly get along.
I'd like to sell tickets to that dance.
Juste remember
that an XO is not a blunt instrument.
The two of you have to make up a team.
That takes trust.
Well, we trust each other
to do our jobs.
I guess that's a start.
Now that your house is in order,
I have a mission for you.
Against my better judgment,
I let a science team
take a Raptor from us.
Go out to study a supernova remnant.
They're overdue.
I want you to track their course.
See what you turn up.
There are three civilians, two pilots.
And if we run into the Cylons?
It's a search and rescue mission.
Don't get into a battle
that you don't wanna fight.
That beeing said,
use your own judgment.
This is your command.
<i>Nothing to the right of me,
nothing to the left of me.</i>
Feel like
I'm drowning in nothing out here.
<i>Come on, Showboat, sing out.
Let me know I got company.</i>
<i>Sing out, Kat? You mean, like a song?</i>
<i>How about
"Ninety nine bottles of Ambrosia"?</i>
<i>Damn, Showboat.</i>
<i>You're taking me back.</i>
<i>Road trips.</i>
Thank you.
- Pass me the circuit board.
- Here you go.
The sickbay just lost another two.
- That raises our casualties to what?
- 723.
It's more than a quarter of our crew.
What's our fighter status?
Twelve Vipers destroyed,
along with two Raptors.
Another seventeen ships
too badly damaged to be repaired.
What else?
Sir, we've tried to keep a lid
on what we learned
from com traffic before it stopped.
But rumors keep leaking out.
- We need facts, not supposition.
- I agree.
We're four, maybe five,
plotted jumps back to the colonies.
I don't imagine you wanna risk
the whole ship for a recon run, right?
Send two Raptors,
tell them not to engage
- the enemy. I want information only.
- Yes, Sir.
Ready to reboot nav
and defense computer systems. Stand by.
Lieutenant.
Admiral.
The helms, weapons and FTL computer
are all back on line
and I think I know how
the Cylons took down our defense grid.
These lines of code in the new
navigation program were about to upload.
They've been designed
to create a backdoor
that could enable an enemy
to wirelessly access the program.
That could introduce a virus that
could affect the entire network, right?
Luckily, ours was already down
but I suggest that we keep it that way
even after we've purged the program.
All right, Lieutenant, it's your ball.
Run with it.
You're not quite
as useless as I thought.
How long have you been at your station?
I don't know, Sir.
I guess I just never left.
You should consider getting rag time.
It's been 2 days since the attack.
Sir.
Sir, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about the way
I behaved when the nukes hit.
I was scared.
Actually, I was terrified,
and I froze.
You're not afraid anymore, are you, Lt?
- No, sir.
- Good.
You hold on to that anger
and you keep it close.
It'll stop you being afraid the
next time. It'll tell you what to do.
Lieutenant, button up.
This is your Admiral.
I know there have been
a lot of rumors going around
about the destruction that's been
visited on our homeworlds by the Cylons.
<i>I would like to tell you that
they're exaggerations but in fact,</i>
<i>they don't even come close to conveying</i>
<i>the horror
that has just been unleashed upon us.</i>
The facts are...
that our colonies have been destroyed,
our cities have been nuked,
and our fleet's gone too.
<i>So far, there are no indications
of any other survivors.</i>
<i>I imagine you're all asking yourselves
the same question I am.</i>
What do we do, now?
Do we run?
Do we hide?
I think those are the easy choices.
A philosopher once said:
"When face with untenable alternatives,
you should consider your imperative."
Look around you.
Our imperative is right here.
In our bulkheads,
in our planes, in our guns,
and in ourselves.
War is our imperative.
And if right now,
victory seems like an impossibility,
then there is something else
to reach for.
Revenge.
Payback.
So, we will fight.
Because in the end, it's the only
alternative our enemies have left us.
<i>I say let's make these murdering things</i>
understand that as long
as this crew and this ship survive
that this war that they started
will not be over.
Thank you.
So say we all.
So say we all.
So say we all!
Com relay that it looks more like
some kind of frakked up can opener.
From what we can tell, it's guarded
by about a half dozen Raiders.
- That's all?
- They don't expect anyone to attack it.
Gentlemen,
you're looking at our first target.
Nice work finding it, Lieutenant.
Thanks, I had help.
Speak of the devil.
- Hello, Gina, welcome.
- Hello.
Gentlemen,
I'd like you to meet Miss Gina Inviere.
Miss Inviere and Lieutenant Shaw
have been working very closely
upgrading our systems and before that,
she was supervising our retrofit
and I must say she's proven herself
invaluable in both capacities.
Thank you.
You certainly set a beautiful table.
Thank you.
Everyone, please have a seat. Please...
I think it's quite important
for our ship's officers
to get together every once in a while.
Share some food, some wine,
some good conversation.
Ups moral.
Not to mention it's the only time
we get to park our butts on a chair.
Now that you're all here,
I would like to take a moment
to say a few words.
In all seriousness,
I said some things before,
in the heat of emotion.
Things that
I felt this crew needed to hear.
But I don't want any of you
for one moment
to think that I would
ever risk lives or resources
in some mad quest for revenge.
My plan
is to wage an all-out
classic guerilla war campaign.
I want to find their weak links
and I want to hit them hard.
As they say,
the best defense is a good offense.
Well, then here's to a good offense
and to kicking some cylon ass!
Almost done here.
I don't know how we could firewall these
systems by tomorrow unless we split up.
And you're the only one
with the access codes.
We can speak to the Admiral
about raising your security clearance.
And here I thought
we were being so discreet.
Guess that's hard
when you truly care for someone.
Program's uploaded.
You need to input your code.
Alpha one niner six gamma one.
To satisfy your curiosity,
we met a few months ago when
I presented the plans for the retrofit.
We spent a lot of time together
working out the details
and I guess one thing led to the other.
You seem so surprised.
It's just that
Cain seems so self-sufficient.
She has needs, just like the rest of us.
No one can survive entirely on her own.
Trust me, Lieutenant.
In the end, we're all just human.
<i>How about "99 bottles of Ambrosia".</i>
- <i>Damn, Showboat. You're taking me back.</i>
- She ever shut up?
Chatter like that breeds sloppiness,
it's a bad example for the other pilots.
As long as she sets a good example
with her flying, we'll come out ahead.
Sir?
Multiple dradis contacts
bearing 3-9-9, carom 6-2-0.
Fighter size...
- unknown configuration, Sir.
- Raiders, it has to be.
We got company.
Pegasus, Starbuck.
Where did these guys come from?
Starbuck, actual.
You and Showboat
double time back to the nest.
<i>On our way, Pegasus,
I don't like these odds.</i>
<i>Showboat, stay with me.</i>
Defensive batteries, selective fire
only, watch out for our people.
Prep for jump
as soon as we recover our birds.
Aye, sir.
These ships...
I can almost see 'em.
There's something weird about them.
Sir, shouldn't we launch alert Vipers
and engage?
That's not why we're here, Major.
Sir, wh...
If we spot our missing ship,
we'll go after her.
Otherwise, we jump out of here,
we report back to Galactica.
Pegasus, Starbuck. We got ourselves
a problem out here.
Our new friends
don't want to say goodbye.
Sir,
FTL crew reports power failure
in main navigational computer.
You gotta be kidding me.
Let's go to emergency backup.
We need those jump coordinates.
They're all over us.
We can't break free.
Ensign, direct all batteries to commence
full auto-fire, close range.
Now, Ensign.
- What the frak?
- We're inside their firing solution.
<i>No frakking kidding!</i>
Open up with all you got.
We're gonna shoot ourselves a hole.
<i>Is that gonna work?</i>
No, but it'll make you feel better.
Frak!
Son of a bitch.
For frak sakes, it's like
she was trying to get us killed.
Look, Major Shaw has the authority
to take any action she feels necessary
- to protect this ship.
- She's a loose cannon.
And she's also the XO.
And frankly, ordering that barrage
probably saved your skin.
Forgive me, if I don't say "thanks".
- Come on, Kara! Just...
- Don't!
You wanna tell me
what the hell you were thinking?
That was a nice bit of flying, Captain.
But I'd think twice
- about questioning my tactical orders.
- Tactical orders?
That's what you call
blowing the crap out of your own pilot.
Questioning orders
is a bad idea on this ship,
Captain!
- How many raiders, Lt?
- Reading twelve signatures, Sir.
It's more than we anticipated.
But one squadron should be able
to handle them and destroy the target.
Launch Blue squadron.
- New contacts.
- What the hell?
There's a lot of jamming
going on out there.
But I'm reading
15 full squadrons of raiders, Sir.
They must have jumped in
right after we launched our fighters.
This isn't a com relay.
This is a staging ground.
Recall the vipers, Sir?
Two minutes to contact.
Admiral, the Cylons knew we were coming.
We have to recover the Vipers
and jump out of here while we still can.
No.
Scramble the reserves.
Order them to provide cover
while Blue attacks the target.
They'll be outnumbered four to one.
A squadron of Raiders has broken off
and are now inbound.
Activate defensive batteries.
They're not responding.
The networks lock us out
of our weapons grid.
Then have gun crews
assume manual control.
Admiral.
We are hugely outnumbered. And now,
our own weapon's grid won't respond.
What more proof do we need
that this is a trap?
Or more reason
to launch everything we've got.
This is exactly
what you said we wouldn't do.
Even if we succeed,
is this relay really worth the lives
and planes it will cost?
Mister Belzen, are you refusing
to carry out my orders?
Sir,
I cannot in good conscience obey them.
Mr Belzen, give me your side arm.
- Sir?
- I said: "Give me your side arm."
Now!
Gods!
Colonel Fisk!
You're now my XO.
My order still stands.
Would you execute it?
This is the XO.
Launch all remaining squadrons.
Sir, the controls on port side airlock
4, 10 and 12 have gone active.
We're being boarded by the Cylons.
Colonel,
Fire up the fast response teams.
<i>- All hands, repel boarders...
- Lt, get to secondary damage control.</i>
They'll try and vent our air and kill us
before we have chance to fight back.
Yes, Sir.
Go!
They're coming this way,
killing everyone.
Go to CIC. You'll be safe there.
What the frak?
You! Step away from the Admiral.
- Lieutenant?
- I said: "Step away from the Admiral."
Now!
You two. Take her into custody.
Belay that.
Lt, what the hell is going on?
She was helping us
with our weapons grid.
No she wasn't, Sir.
She's a cylon spy. They look like us.
Oh, for Gods sake!
Mister Hoshi,
can you please show us
the security feed from airlock 4.
This is crazy.
I don't know what she thought she saw.
My Gods!
- Get that thing off my bridge.
- Yes, Sir.
Act like officers, Gods damn it!
You've got everybody
watching you on this deck.
Where the hell did they come from?
It's been a long time since
I seen one of these outside a museum.
And you say the entire fleet jumped in?
They came out of nowhere.
Why would the Cylons resurrect
a machine that by their standards
is hopelessly obsolete?
Maybe they didn't resurrect it.
Maybe they were out here all along.
You have something you wanna tell us?
There are references in our databases,
to a force of centurions,
called Guardians.
Early models like this,
that somehow escaped being scrapped.
What do this Guardians guard?
A hybrid.
An entity that represents the first step
in our evolution
from pure machines to organic beings.
From them,
to us.
A cylon missing link.
No, more like an evolutionary dead end.
There were other hybrids
created to control our baseships
before the experiment was abandoned,
but...
this one was the first.
And...
some think it's still alive.
Protected by these Guardians.
And that it's still somehow seeking
its own way to evolve.
The last operation of the war,
Galactica was part of a task force
that destroyed a cylon base.
I was on that mission.
The Cylons were supposedly building
a superweapon.
<i>All this has happened before.</i>
<i>And will happen again.</i>
Is someone in there?
Help.
Help us, they left us here.
Don't leave us here, please.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
We're civilians.
We're traders, from Gemenon. We...
They jumped our convoy. They destroyed
our escort. They took us all prisoners.
There were 50 of us but they've been
taking us away, one by one.
We could hear the others screaming.
We didn't know what happened to them.
Please you gotta get us all out of here.
I'm trying.
The door must be welded shut.
- What the hell is happening?
- I don't know.
Feels like a quake.
The place is starting to come apart.
I got it!
Still stuck.
I can't open it any wider.
You gotta go. You gotta go get help.
I stay here. I stay here with you.
No, you can't do it by yourself.
Just go!
Tell what happened to us.
Our ship was the Diana.
From Gemenon, all right? Just tell them.
If you stay here,
you'll be trapped like us.
Go!
Go! Save yourself.
Go!
Galactica, Husker.
Galactica, this is Husker. Do you copy?
<i>Husker, roger that. Report status.</i>
I crashed on the surface.
They were making something down here.
Experimenting on people to do it.
And now they're getting away
with whatever they've built.
<i>Husker, the war is over!</i>
What?
Galactica repeat!
<i>The war is over.</i>
<i>An armistice was just signed.</i>
<i>Activate your beacon,
we'll send you the SAR bird.</i>
<i>Husker, respond.</i>
<i>They escaped with it.</i>
Right before they signed the armistice.
If this hybrid still exists,
and it's captured some of our people.
I don't want to think about it.
Baltar and Tyrol were able to
pull the Raider's computer and
download the ship's navigational data
and extrapolate
a possible location for a base.
But it's more likely a baseship.
That's where we'll find our Raptor crew.
It's two, maybe three jumps
from where you were attacked.
I was just telling the commander that we
can't afford to commit both battlestars.
Which is why I'm temporarily
transferring my flag to Pegasus.
- You're going along?
- You're still in command.
Let's just say
I have a personal stake in this mission.
A mission based on a cylon legend.
It's not a legend, son.
I was in the place
where they made that thing.
I saw what they did to make it.
We're not gonna let this happen again.
Not to our own people.
I'll have my XO
start preparing an attack plan.
I'm afraid that brings us
another matter.
Commander.
Misdirection is the key.
Pegasus jumps
right into the hornet's nest.
They swarm us with their Raiders.
We let them think
they've taken out our FTL
before moving off at sublight speed,
drawing them away.
That's when my strike team jumps in.
It's a hell of a risky plan,
but I guess you know that.
Just remember it's search and rescue.
Get aboard, find our people, set
your nuke, then get back in one peace.
- Who's piloting the Raptor?
- Captain Thrace.
No other pilot
I can trust to pull this off.
Well, I guess the question is
whether I can trust you.
The President believes
that under admiral Cain
you were involved in an incident
aboard a civilian transport,
called Scylla.
An incident in which ten people
were executed. It is true?
<i>I said, is it true?</i>
I was there.
Guessing that's enough to indict me.
Why didn't you tell me?
You said you wanted
to send a message to this ship's crew,
about respecting Cain's legacy.
I am Cain's legacy.
I'm alive
because of the choices she made.
So is everyone else on this ship.
Tell you something else?
Cain wouldn't have blinked twice
at this plan.
She knew that you don't win battles,
never mind wars, without risking lives.
Are you finished?
Yes, Sir.
If you'd like my resignation,
you can have it.
It'd be easier, wouldn't it?
Then you can go back
to peeling potatoes,
wallowing in self pity,
'cause poor Kendra Shaw
is the only officer in the fleet
who've ever had to make a hard call.
Well, it's not gonna fly, Major.
Not while I'm in command.
Plan's risky,
but right now,
you're the only game in town.
So, complete your mission, Major.
Your plan's approved.
<i>Petrius, this is Adriatic </i>
<i>got another load of solid waste
stinkin' in our cargo hold.</i>
<i>Petrius, this is Adriatic.
Got another load...</i>
<i>... and we're back with Gaius Baltar.</i>
<i>Doctor, a lot of people once thought
of Pegasus as the answer to our prayer.</i>
<i>Were they wrong?</i>
Final casualty report
lists 816 dead, 121 injured.
32 Vipers destroyed, 61 badly damaged.
The acting chief says we don't have
enough parts to repair them all.
That's a rather high price
for a tactically insignificant victory.
I wouldn't say it's insignificant, Sir.
I'd say we put the enemy on notice.
The price we paid is my fault.
How do you figure that, Lt?
Well I gave her... <i>it</i> my access codes.
It must have used them
to override our security lockouts.
No, you gave it
something far more important than that.
You gave it your trust,
as did I. But this thing
really knows how to manipulate
human emotions,
preys on them.
Lieutenant Thorne,
I want you to interrogate
our cylon prisoner.
Find out everything it knows.
And since it's so adept
at mimicking human feeling,
I'm assuming that its software
is vulnerable to them as well, so...
Pain, yes, of course.
Degradation,
fear,
shame.
I want you to really test its limits.
Be as creative as you need to be.
Yes, Sir.
<i>Lieutenant Thorne. Access granted.</i>
<i>Admiral Cain to CIC.</i>
Lieutenant, come with me.
Colonel, sitrep.
We just detected a fleet of ships
broadcasting colonial IFF signature.
Sir,
they're civilians.
A civilian fleet.
15 ships, Sir.
The CAP has gone ahead to intercept.
Lieutenant, I want you to contact
those ships' captains.
Ask them to forward
their crew and passenger manifest
along with their ships' schematics and
inventory of any weapons or spare parts.
Yes, Sir.
Colonel, I want you to assemble
teams of engineers and marines
and have them board each of those ships.
Sir, are we...
We're gonna take
everything we need from those ships.
And once they'll realize our intent,
there's bound to be resistance.
So we need
to act quickly and decisively.
Colonel, if you have a problem
with any of this, I need to hear it now.
No.
Get to work.
Permission to come aboard?
Permission granted. Welcome.
We prayed for this miracle.
The last time the Cylons found us,
we lost 4 ships but now,
thank the Gods, you've found us.
Mr. Laird, admiral Cain
ordered me to give you this.
- What is it?
- It's a list of materials
and passengers we need transferred
to the Pegasus. Effective immediately.
Your name is on the list.
My name?
Wait. You want to take our FTL drives.
We'll be helpless.
As I said, we're adding
some of your people to our crew.
So...
you're gonna decide just like that
who lives and who dies?
We make whatever accommodations we can,
but, you have to understand.
We're at war.
Military need must take priority.
I don't understand. They're...
they're gonna take what they want
and leave us to fend for ourselves.
I can't do that.
- I can't do it.
- No.
Listen!
All of you!
We have orders
to transfer the crewmen,
and the equipment
on that list, to Pegasus.
We have no wish to harm anyone,
but we will use force if necessary.
No.
You can't do that.
You can't do that.
- Keep them back!
- You're here to help us.
You can't do that!
<i>Ship to ship call from colonel Fisk.</i>
<i>What's going on, Colonel?
You're already behind schedule.</i>
Sir, they're denying us access
to the rest of the ship.
We're not dealing with just individuals,
Sir. We have
<i>whole families here.</i>
Then tell them you'll shoot the families
of any selectee who doesn't comply.
<i>Sir, did I hear you correctly?</i>
<i>- You don't seriously mean that we...</i>
- Just get it done, Colonel.
Corporal.
Get these people on the deck
- and get them lined up.
- Yes, Sir.
We have orders...
to shoot the families
of any selectee
who refuses to return with us.
We will carry out this order.
Unless, those individuals
are brought forward, now!
- You're supposed to protect us!
- I repeat.
We will carry out this order!
We will shoot these people.
What are we doing, Sir?
Sir?
Colonel Fisk, to Pegasus.
Colonel Fisk, to Pegasus.
It's over.
The whole fleet has word
of what happened here.
There won't be any more resistance.
<i>Colonial 1 to Raptor 3-5-9,
clear for docking approach.</i>
<i>Colonial 1 to Raptor 3-5-9,
clear for docking approach.</i>
<i>Galactica to Greenleaf shuttle,
you are clear for landing.</i>
<i>Checker's red. Speed too...</i>
So the XO is human after all.
I used to do that myself.
Scrub through the wireless band,
reminds you you're not alone out here.
Got any more?
More of what?
What of you're about
to stick in your neck.
You don't miss much, do you?
Whatever floats your boat, right?
I came down here looking for a loose
bottle, you came down here for...
Guess we both just trying
to take the edge off, right?
Guess so.
That's good.
Cause I'd hate to think that Lee's
new XO can't handle the pressure.
Maybe you want to get busted back
to peeling potatoes.
I hate to think that Lee's
favorite pilot wants to find herself
scrubbing floors
for pilfering ship's stores.
You keep my secret, Sir?
I'll keep yours.
<i>Unconfirmed reports continue</i>
<i>to attribute President Roslin's
recent miraculous recovery from...</i>
I've seen officers happier
about a promotion.
I am happy, Sir, I am.
I guess I just don't know
what I've done to deserve it.
Don't, Captain.
Don't do it. Don't look back.
Sometimes, we have to leave people
behind, so that we can go on.
So that we can continue to fight.
Sometimes, we have to do things
that we never thought
we were capable of,
if only to show the enemy our will.
Yesterday, you showed me
that you are capable
of setting aside your fear,
setting aside your hesitation,
and even your revulsion
every natural inhibition
that during battle
can mean the difference
between life and death.
When you can be this
for as long as you have to be,
then you're a razor.
This war
is forcing us all to become razors
because if we don't, we don't survive.
And then we don't have the luxury
of becoming simply human again.
Do you understand me?
Good.
Well done.
Congratulations, Captain.
<i>President Roslin's
recent executive order</i>
<i>outlawing abortion
led to a demonstration...</i>
Port side hull breaches.
Deck 4, frame 12 through 14.
Damage control crews
are sealing them off now.
I'd say that's enough of that.
Get the FTL offline.
Bring her around. Heading...
- 1-6-1, carom 0.
- Sir.
They're pursuing, Sir.
Let's hope they keep it up.
<i>Looks like they bought it.</i>
<i>Now, let's go get our Raptor crew.</i>
Maybe this will be easier
than we thought.
Guess again, two bandits inbound.
Show time, people.
<i>Ready?</i>
Go, go, go!
Enemy target destroyed.
All wings regroup and
continue pursuit of Battlestar Pegasus.
By your Command.
Gunny, report.
Red squad all accounted for.
Speak for yourself, sarge.
I'm still counting fingers and toes.
Knock it off, Hudson.
Red squad, form up on me.
Ain't it grand
when a plan comes together?
Red squad, on my mark.
Fire thrusters.
<i>Red 1, Pegasus.</i>
Red 1, this is Pegasus actual.
Report mission and team status.
<i>We're in, we were able to access
an airlock on one of the radial arms.</i>
<i>Proceeding toward the core, no contact,
no casualties.</i>
<i>Stay frosty, kiddies.</i>
<i>No telling how many of those toasters
they left watching the house.</i>
Shut your yap, Hudson.
Maybe we won't have to find out.
DaSilva, what do you read on thermals?
<i>One heat source.</i>
<i>Could be biological.</i>
<i>Near the core, but that's all.</i>
<i>Wait. I'm picking up
three or more signatures.</i>
<i>Two of them are pretty weak but they're
coming from about 30 meters ahead.</i>
<i>Could be our people. Gunny, take point.</i>
- Holy frak.
- Get them out of there, go!
Help us.
Get them out of here. Come on!
Cylons!
Everybody out, now!
Let's go!
Come on!
<i>Man down! They got DaSilva!</i>
No!
<i>Pegasus, Red 2.</i>
<i>Come in, Pegasus.</i>
Copy, Red 2 but your signal is weak.
<i>Recovered two civilians.</i>
<i>One dead, two wounded. Including the XO.</i>
<i>We're pinned down, taking heavy fire.</i>
<i>Mission out come doubtful.</i>
Pegasus, Red 2. Come in, Pegasus.
Pegasus.
Frak.
Captain!
Sitrep!
We just lost communications.
- Cylons must be jamming.
- What about the nuke?
How's that detonator coming, Mathias?
Detonator's fried.
Get it working.
You want to tell me
what the hell that was with DaSilva?
Can't let them
take any more prisoners, Captain.
- You saw what they were doing in there.
- Yes, I saw it.
Keep trying to resume communications
with Red 2.
Yes, Sir.
Mr. Hoshi.
Order nuclear
ship-to-ship missile into launch tube 3.
Aye, Sir.
This is a nuclear mission order.
Load ship-to-ship missile
into launch tube 3.
- What are you doing?
- They've been compromised.
If we can't regain communications,
we have to assume the team's been lost.
We have to give them a chance.
Commander Adama?
- Open launch tube doors.
- Open launch tube doors.
Major.
Watch those corridors, Hudson.
Pegasus, Red 2. Come in.
Destroying that ship
with people on board is a last resort.
Like it or not, Admiral,
this is no longer a rescue mission.
Gods only know what will happen
to our people if they're captured.
I know what'll happen.
I was there.
Nukes are loaded, Commander.
Release of nuclear weapons
is authorized.
Disable launch and warhead safeties.
Mr. Hoshi, take your launch key.
- Put it in the firing lock.
- Aye, Sir.
Belay that order.
I'm not prepared
to sacrifice any lives. Not yet.
- And if you're wrong?
- Then I'll have to live with it.
You said it yourself, Admiral.
That thing
maybe headed toward Earth.
If it jumps away, then we'll lose
our only hope of taking it out.
Sir, jamming's clearing.
Receiving a transmission from Red 2.
- Put it through on speakers.
- Aye, Sir.
Launch evac Raptor.
<i>Pegasus, this is Red 2. Come in.</i>
<i>Pegasus, this is Red 2. Come in.</i>
Yes.
Red 2, this is Pegasus actual.
Starbuck, report.
Still pinned down but holding on.
<i>Tell me there's a ride waiting for us.</i>
On their way, Red 2.
The Raiders've broken off their attack.
They'll be headed to you any second now.
<i>Roger that.</i>
<i>It means we're running out of time.</i>
Evac Raptor's on its way. They want us
to set the nuke and get the hell out.
That's gonna be a problem.
Remote detonator's definitely shot.
- Can you rig a manual trigger?
- Probably.
Then do it.
Do it?
- What the hell are you talking about?
- We are completing this mission.
Am I clear, soldier?
Yes, Sir.
<i>Red team, Pegasus. Evac ETA two minutes.</i>
This is Red 2, give me actual.
Red 2, this is actual.
What's taking you so long?
They're gonna be on you any second.
<i>Our nuke's remote detonator
is still fried.</i>
<i>We're gonna have to cook it off by hand.</i>
<i>Red 1 is still down for the count.
Witch doesn't give us many options.</i>
What are your orders, Sir?
We still got a missile in the tube.
If that evac bird gets them off,
we can still fire this thing off.
- Mr. Hoshi.
- The Raiders are
in their air defense position.
You launch anything,
they gonna intercept it.
Then we have to leave someone behind,
arm the warhead manually.
That's right.
This is your team, son.
You make the call.
Red 2, this is Pegasus actual.
Get the XO, get your men
and get to the evac coordinates.
<i>Secure your men,
then detonate the warhead</i>
<i>using the manual trigger.</i>
Complete your mission, Captain.
Understood.
- Sergeant! Get ready to move out.
- Yes, Sir.
All right, Major, on your feet.
We gonna get you out of here.
Come on everybody move inside, let's go!
Get your suits on.
Come on, go, go, go!
You too, Major. Let's get...
You too, Captain.
Leave the nuke, if you don't mind.
What the frak are you doing?
Completing the mission.
Take it.
I don't need it anymore.
Major.
I just gave you an order, soldier.
Unless you wanna die,
I suggest you obey it. Go.
Why?
You know damn well why.
Put on your suit,
you're about to run out of air.
<i>It's been an honor, Captain.</i>
<i>All this has happened before</i>
<i>and will happen again.</i>
<i>Come in, Major. I've been
waiting for you for a long time.</i>
You're what all this is about,
aren't you?
What are you?
What am I? A man.
Or am I a machine?
My children believe I am a God.
Are you...
a god?
I have seen things,
your life, Kendra Shaw,
the things you've done...
the things you felt you had to do...
all leading to this moment.
Do you wish to be forgiven, my child.
I repeat!
We will carry out this order!
We will shoot these people!
What are we doing, Sir?
Sir?
Do you wish to be forgiven?
- Yes.
- Then, come closer.
There's something I have to tell you.
Come.
Kara Thrace will lead
the human race to its end.
- What?
- She is the herald of the Apocalypse.
The harbinger of death.
They must not follow her.
<i>Pegasus, evac Raptor inbound.
Extraction complete. Clear of Baseship.</i>
Raptor is on its way back, Sir.
They have Starbuck aboard.
Major Shaw stayed behind.
Starbuck?
<i>Actual.</i>
<i>This is Red 1.</i>
<i>Come in.</i>
- Red 1, this is Pegasus Actual. Report.
<i>- Commander?</i>
<i>I've gotta warn you.</i>
<i>It's Captain Thrace.</i>
- Red 1, report!
- They're jamming us again, Sir.
- Red 1, this is Actual, come in!
- We lost her.
Actual.
Come in.
Actual.
As my own existence comes to a close,
only to begin a new,
in ways... uncertain.
You're scared,
aren't you, my little frakker?
You should be.
All this has happened before.
And will happen again.
Again.
You wanted to see me, Admiral.
Thank you for coming in.
Starbuck was here a little earlier.
She's recommended major Shaw
for a posthumous commendation.
She wasn't looking for medals.
No, she wasn't.
But I've been going through Cain's logs,
and from a tactical perspective,
it's hard to find a fault
in anything that she did,
or that Kendra did.
They butchered innocent civilians, Dad.
Come on.
How can you ignore that?
I know that I didn't have to face
any of the situations that she did.
I had the President in my face,
arguing for the survival
of the civilian fleet,
I had colonel Tigh to keep me honest,
balancing my morality and my tactics,
and I had you.
Now...
you don't have any children,
so you might not understand this,
but you see yourself
reflected in their eyes.
And there are some things that
I thought of doing, with this fleet.
But I stopped myself because I knew
that I'd have to face you
the following day.
If you hadn't been in CIC,
I would have ordered that strike.
Kara would be dead,
so would the rest of the team.
You did nothing wrong,
neither did I.
We both made decisions that we had to,
to accomplish our missions.
Yeah.
Cain.
Kendra.
Were they wrong?
And if I believed in the Gods,
I'd say they'd be judged
by a high power.
But since you don't believe...
Then history will have
to make its judgments.
And since history's first draft
will be written in our logs...
Well, I guess
I've got some writing to do.
Think about that commendation.
Yeah, I will.
Not a lot to show for a life, huh?
I guess not.
Do you have any idea why she did it?
Maybe she thought
she had a lot to answer for.
Maybe she had it coming...
We've all got it coming.
You might as well hear this from me.
I've asked to be reassigned
to Galactica.
Any reason?
You might say that I've a beef
with my commanding officer.
And... what's that?
That mother-frakker keeps
trying to get me killed.
Well,
you ever think you might deserve it?
Speak for yourself, Lee, I...
have a destiny.
I had my palm read by a Cylon, remember?
A destiny, right?
You better believe it. So I guess, you
are stuck with me till the end.
I gotta go break in your new CAG,
Sir.

<i>Précédemment dans</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
La nova ressemble
au mandala à l'intérieur du temple.
Peut-être est-ce un panneau
indiquant la direction de la Terre.
Il était dans le temple.
D'où t'est venue l'idée de peindre ça ?
C'est juste un truc que je griffonne
depuis gamine, j'aimais bien la forme.
<i>Tu descends trop bas.</i>
Allez, Lee. Sors-la de là.
- Reviens !
- Laisse-moi partir.
<i>Ils m'attendent.</i>
Non !
Gaius Baltar,
après avoir examiné les preuves,
ce tribunal vous déclare non coupable.
Attrapez-le. Faites-le sortir d'ici !
Gaius, ça va aller. Suivez-moi.
- Où m'emmenez-vous ?
- Vers votre nouvelle vie.
On va à la Nébuleuse Ionienne.
- Situation ?
- Variations de puissance détectées.
Je vérifie la flotte.
C'est vrai.
On est des Cylons.
Et on l'a toujours été.
Contact dradis ! Grosse flotte cylon,
sur trajectoire d'interception !
Ordonnez à la flotte un saut d'urgence.
Monsieur, tous les vaisseaux
se sont arrêtés pendant la coupure.
Il faudra au moins 20 min
pour faire chauffer les FTL.
On n'a pas 20 minutes.
Postes de combat.
Condition 1 sur tout le vaisseau.
<i>Ce n'est pas un exercice.
Tous les pilotes regagnent leur Viper.</i>
J'ai un contact ennemi à 10 heures.
Je vais vérifier.
C'est quoi ce bordel ?
- Salut, Lee.
- Kara ?
J'ai vu la Terre.
Je sais où elle est.
Et je vais nous y conduire.
Non, c'est de la folie pure.
J'ai vu ton vaisseau exploser.
Non, désolée.
T'as pas entendu ? J'ai vu la Terre.
La Terre.
<i>De grands océans bleus,
des nuages blancs cotonneux.</i>
<i>Tu vas adorer.</i>
<i>Promis.</i>
- Identifiez ce vaisseau sur-le-champ.
- Je vérifie le code de reconnaissance.
- Passez-moi Lee !
- J'essaie.
- C'est sa signature.
- C'est bien sa voix.
Attendez,
ce n'est pas réel, c'est un piège.
Vérifiez à nouveau.
En cours.
- Contacts hostiles ! Plus de 200 !
- CAG, détruisez-les !
À tous les pilotes.
Menace cap 3-5-0, inclinaison 2-1-1.
<i>Raptors, couvrez-nous de l'arrière.
Feu à volonté.</i>
Me perds pas cette fois, Apollo.
Aucun risque.
Un de moins !
<i>Prenez ça, putains de toasters !</i>
Amiral, c'est un piège des Cylons.
Les Vipers ont stoppé la première vague,
mais la seconde est passée.
Envoyez tout ce qui vole, immédiatement.
Saul.
Saul !
Tu as un problème ?
Non, Bill.
Je me suis jamais senti aussi bien.
Colonel Tigh !
Je vous ai donné un ordre.
Envoyez tous ceux
qui ont déjà tenu un manche.
Déployez-les !
- Envoyez-les là-bas !
- Oui, Monsieur.
Votre attention, ici le XO.
Mettez-moi cet oiseau dans le tube.
Et celui de Showboat aussi.
Ils foutent quoi, ces bleus ?
Maman vous sauvera pas aujourd'hui !
Vous voulez voler ou pas ?
Prêts ou pas, on y va.
C'est de la folie. Et si un verrou saute
encore et que je trahis les miens ?
Boucle-la.
On fait comme le colonel a dit.
Restes-en là.
Sois celui que tu veux être,
jusqu'à ta mort.
Facile à dire, je sais pas qui je suis.
Tu es Samuel T. Anders. Point barre.
- Monte dans ton vaisseau.
- Qui veux-tu qu'il soit ?
Salut, le bleu.
Garde la tête froide, OK ?
Tu vises
et tu fais comme à l'entraînement.
C'est comme
avant un match de championnat.
Voilà. Bonne chasse.
Si elle a rien remarqué,
les Cylons n'y verront que du feu.
Attends pas la confirmation,
tire le premier.
Vas-y et descends-nous quelque chose.
On se bouge ! Chargez-moi ces Vipers !
Anders, dans votre putain de Viper !
- Où m'emmenez-vous ?
- On a trouvé un compartiment inutilisé.
- On a perdu le Pyxis !
- Par les Dieux,
le Capitaine Tarney.
600 âmes sur ce vaisseau.
Comment nous ont-ils trouvés ?
C'est la bonne question.
Ils envoient des missiles, 40...
Correction, plus de 50 en approche.
La moitié sur nous,
l'autre sur la flotte.
Concentrez les batteries
sur ceux qui ciblent la flotte.
On peut encaisser les tirs, pas eux.
Interceptez en priorité
<i>les missiles ennemis visant les civils.</i>
Je suis Samuel T. Anders.
Je suis né sur Picon.
Je suis allé à l'école Noyce.
Lâche le bouton de transmission !
- <i>Tu bloques la fréquence.</i>
- Bien reçu.
Putain de merde !
<i>Longshot, ici Hardball.</i>
Cible en bas à 3 heures. J'engage.
<i>Longshot, j'ai le...</i>
Tally, je te couvre.
Seelix, t'as un Raider au cul !
- <i>Tire, Anders !</i>
- J'essaie !
Par les Dieux !
Monsieur, les Cylons retournent
vers leurs vaisseaux.
Les vaisseaux-mères vont sauter.
Ils se retirent.
On va faire pareil
avant qu'ils changent d'avis.
- Mettez les chasseurs en couverture.
- Oui, Monsieur.
Chasseurs, en couverture arrière.
On était faits. Fin de la partie.
Mais pourquoi
ils nous ont laissé partir ?
Quelque chose a peut-être changé.
À savoir ?
Aucune idée, Madame la Présidente.
Aucune idée.

Vous serez en sécurité ici, Gaius.
Je vois...
Chef, il faut que vous développiez
mes clichés rapidement.
J'ai un sacré tas de photos de vacances.
Il me faut ma check-list post-vol.
Je veux signer
pour pouvoir prendre une douche.
J'en ai pas pour vous.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
OK.
OK, moi aussi. Tout va bien.
Tu crois aux miracles ?
Non.
J'ai dit à tout le monde
que t'étais increvable.
Ça va, je vais bien.
Je vais bien.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous
en tenue de pilote ?
Y a une semaine que
j'ai fini la formation Viper,
je commence l'ACM.
Bon sang...
Starbuck !
J'ai réussi, patron.
J'ai trouvé la Terre.
- Tout le monde recule.
- En position.
Avancez.
Restez à distance !
Allez à l'infirmerie.
Cottle va vous faire un examen complet.
C'est quoi ce bordel ?
Je pars quelques heures et...
Quelques heures ?
Kara, tu es partie
depuis plus de deux mois.
C'est impossible.
L'horloge de mon vaisseau indique
six heures et quelques.
C'est qu'elle est mal réglée, alors.
Sam te dit la vérité.
On te croyait morte.
Quoi ?
Gaius ?
Je voulais vous dire
qu'on revient bientôt.
Quoi que vous fassiez,
ne sortez pas seul. C'est dangereux.
Tracey est à votre service.
On revient
dès qu'on aura vu Derek, OK ?
Derek, c'est votre fils,
n'est-ce pas ?
- Celui qui est à l'infirmerie.
- Oui.
Oui, je...
Je prie pour son rétablissement.
Vraiment ?
- Merci !
- Je vous en prie.
Merci.
Alors quel est le plan, mesdames ?
- "Le plan" ?
- Cet endroit est vraiment très bien.
C'est magnifique.
Mais quand vais-je sortir ?
Et quitter ce vaisseau ?
La sécurité est trop resserrée. Et...
Et quoi ?
Vous voulez me garder ici et...
Aucun vaisseau ne veut de vous.
On revient.
Hier,
tu étais sur le point d'être exécuté.
Aujourd'hui, tu es libre.
Pourquoi cet air triste ?
À vrai dire, je n'en sais rien.
De Président des Colonies à ça.
Roi des fous.
Mieux vaut être haï de tous
qu'aimé par ce groupe.
Condamné à vivre à perpétuité
dans ce repère de cinglés.
Je ne sais pas,
ça doit être lié à mes...
sautes d'humeur sauvages.
Calme-toi.
Je t'aurais amené si loin
pour que ça s'arrête ici ?
J'ai besoin d'encouragements.
Une lueur d'espoir sur l'avenir.
Un soupçon...
Tu m'as, moi.
Je suis là pour toi.
C'est tellement beau.
Bonjour. Désolé, quoi ?
Votre façon de prier.
Oui... Merci, oui.
Ce rituel n'est pas creux.
Non,
non.
C'est comme si les Dieux étaient là,
à vos côtés.
- Eh bien, oui.
- Quand je prie les Dieux,
je me sens...
vide.
Vraiment ? C'est dommage, non ?
Ce sont de faux dieux, dis-lui.
Si vous vous sentez vide en priant Zeus,
Poséidon ou Aphrodite,
c'est que c'est vide.
C'est une expérience complètement vide.
Ils sont...
Ils n'existent pas.
Ils ont été imposés...
par l'élite gouvernante...
pour vous empêcher
d'apprendre la vérité.
Et quelle est cette vérité ?
C'est une bonne question.
Quelle est la...
Il n'y a qu'un seul Dieu.
Il n'y a qu'un seul Dieu.
En substance, voilà la vérité.
On est seuls ici, non ?
Les autres rentrent plus tard.
Et la porte est fermée.
Très bien.
Sentez-vous la présence de Dieu ?
Vous savez quoi ? Je crois que oui.
- Moi aussi.
- Vraiment ? Vous aussi ?
Nous sentons tous les deux...
Quel est le verdict de Cottle ?
Tout correspond.
Donc, je suis bien moi,
pas un Cylon ?
C'était pour ça les tests, non ?
- Kara, personne n'a rien dit de tel.
- Mais vous l'avez pensé.
Il fallait qu'on soit sûrs, Kara.
- Ça marche.
- Reprenons depuis le début.
Combien de fois vous voulez l'entendre ?
Autant qu'il le faudra
pour que ça prenne sens.
J'ai suivi un Raider dans la tempête,
j'ai été touchée, je me suis évanouie.
À mon réveil, j'étais en orbite
autour de cette planète.
Sa lune jaune et son étoile collent
avec la description de la Pythie.
J'ai pris ces photos en orbite.
Les constellations correspondent
à ce qu'on a vu au tombeau d'Athéna.
- Comment êtes-vous revenue ?
- Je l'ai déjà dit, je ne sais pas.
Ce n'est pas suffisant, Capitaine.
Racontez-nous
tout ce dont vous vous rappelez.
Je me rappelle avoir pris des photos,
avoir inversé le cap de mon Viper.
Après, je suis pas sûre.
J'ai encore dû m'évanouir.
Je me souviens
d'une géante gazeuse avec des anneaux.
Je me souviens
d'une étoile triple qui clignote.
Et d'une comète.
Et puis,
j'étais de retour dans la flotte.
Et pour vous,
tout ça n'a duré que six heures.
Je capte pas non plus
le décalage temporel, OK ?
Je sais que j'y étais.
J'ai pris ces photos.
Je l'ai pas rêvé !
Mon équipe l'a nettoyé.
Pas la moindre bosse ou éraflure.
L'immatriculation est la même
qu'à son départ.
Mais je m'occupe de ce coucou
depuis le début,
et on dirait que ce truc sort d'usine.
Ce n'est donc pas le même vaisseau.
À moins qu'elle ait trouvé
un sacré garage là dehors, non, Madame.
Amiral,
il n'y a pas que le fuselage.
Voilà les données
du système de navigation.
Il n'y a rien. C'est vide.
On ignore où ce chasseur est allé.
D'accord...
- Mettez-la en cellule.
- Quoi ?
On trouve des incohérences
et on la soupçonne encore d'être cylon ?
- Et les examens de Cottle ?
- Ses examens ne prouvent rien.
Même si l'ADN est identique,
elle pourrait être un Cylon.
Peut-être que c'en est un
depuis le début.
Le détecteur de Baltar était une merde.
Il a pas réussi à détecter Boomer.
Je sais ce que vous ressentez pour elle,
Bill,
mais les Cylons comptent
peut-être justement là-dessus.
On est de retour au point de départ.
Un Cylon serait ici, on l'ignorerait
jusqu'à ce qu'il nous tire dessus.
Ou qu'il nous tende un piège.
Leur flotte était assez puissante
pour nous détruire,
mais au lieu de ça, ils ont fui.
Et tout à coup, Kara Thrace ressuscite
après avoir trouvé la Terre.
Si Kara Thrace
nous dévie de notre route...
Une "route" ? Quelle "route" ?
La nébuleuse devait être un indice
sur la voie vers la Terre, mais elle...
La nébuleuse
n'est qu'un panneau
le long de la route vers la Terre.
Et nous devons continuer
à suivre son chemin.
Et si Kara...
était l'indice
que nous étions censés trouver ?
Et si elle vous manipulait ?
Et si elle vous manipulait, vous,
et nous tous ?
Gaius, je vous en prie !
Je vous en prie, aidez-moi.
Que se passe-t-il ?
- Mon Dieu !
- Attention à sa tête.
- C'est Derek.
- Derek, c'est ça ?
Derek, je vois.
Où sont mes vêtements ?
- C'est bon.
- Vraiment ?
- Avez-vous un diagnostic ?
- Ils ont dit qu'il avait...
- une encéphalite virale.
- Virale ?
Je sais pas.
C'est une inflammation du cerveau.
- Les médecins n'y peuvent rien ?
- Pas si c'est viral.
Je crains que ça ne dépende
que du système immunitaire de Derek.
Il doit se montrer fort.
Et nous devons nous montrer forts
pour lui.
Je ne voulais pas qu'il meure
dans cette infirmerie...
Alors, je l'ai amené ici.
Pour qu'il soit avec nous.
Avec nous tous.
- Oui, avec nous tous.
- Votre main, s'il vous plaît.
Si seulement...
Vous savez que j'ai prié pour lui.
- Je sais.
- J'ai prié pour lui.
Je sais.
Je suppose...
Je suppose que le seul vrai Dieu
ne veut simplement pas qu'il vive, non ?
Quelqu'un entend encore
cette putain de chanson ?
Non.
Elle s'est peut-être arrêtée
quand on a découvert qui...
Ce qu'on est.
C'était peut-être
une sorte de déclencheur...
pour nous activer.
Après que ce Raider m'ait scanné
avec sa lumière rouge,
cette saloperie a dégagé.
Ils ont tous dégagé.
Il aurait détecté que t'étais un Cylon ?
J'en sais rien.
C'est peut-être pour ça
qu'il a pas tiré. Mais surtout,
pourquoi j'ai pas tiré ?
Racetrack avait raison. C'était
qu'une stupide erreur de débutant.
Vraiment ?
J'étais peut-être programmé
pour laisser la sécurité.
Ces ordures peuvent pas
me programmer pour les aider.
Jamais.
Boomer pensait pareil.
Et elle a descendu le patron.
Boomer ignorait ce qu'elle était.
Pas nous.
Ça n'arrivera pas.
On est d'accord ?
J'ignore pourquoi je suis là.
En fait, je sais.
Je suis là
à cause de ce que nous avons partagé
- et de ce que nous avons vu...
- Les visions dans l'Opéra.
Vous êtes entrée
et vous en avez vu plus que moi.
J'ai pensé que vous pourriez m'aider.
De quelle façon ?
Je dois savoir qui sont les cinq autres.
Les modèles que nous n'avons jamais vus.
Ceux que...
Baltar appelle "les cinq".
Et vous voulez savoir
si Kara Thrace est l'un d'eux.
Oui.
J'ai été programmée
pour ne jamais penser à eux.
Ça ne fonctionne pas
parce qu'en ce moment, vous y pensez.
J'essaie d'éviter.
Essayer, c'est déjà y penser.
Comment vous expliquez ça ?
C'est bon.
Reculez. Ne partez pas, reculez.
Les cinq sont proches.
Quoi ?
Je les sens.
Et celui-là ?
C'est un système protoplanétaire.
Et ?
Rien que des cailloux.
Aucune géante gazeuse annelée,
comme vous prétendez avoir vu.
- Je l'ai vraiment vue, Lt.
- Si vous le dites, Cpt.
- Et que dites-vous, M. Gaeta ?
- Rien du tout, Capitaine.
- Je suis seulement les ordres.
- Eh bien, je vous ordonne de m'aider.
- Vous "m'ordonnez" ?
- M. Gaeta, faites une pause.
Avec plaisir, Monsieur.
Compte à rebours lancé, Dee.
Sortez-nous de là.
Oui, Monsieur.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Je le lis sur son visage.
Sur tous leurs visages.
Personne ne me croit.
Tu veux qu'on te croie ?
Trouve ce système solaire.
C'est une perte de temps.
On y a passé que quelques heures.
On a trouvé une douzaine de Ternaires.
- Baltar y avait passé des mois.
- Ça marche pas comme ça.
Comment ça marche, Kara ?
C'est une impression.
Une intuition.
J'ai fait l'aller-retour
sans utiliser la navigation.
Quand on était près de la nébuleuse,
c'était limpide.
À chaque saut, la clarté s'estompe.
Si on continue à s'éloigner comme ça,
je retrouverai pas le chemin.
Ça sera tout.
À tout l'équipage, saut dans dix...
C'est à la Présidente d'en décider.
On continue sur le chemin
indiqué par l'Oeil de Jupiter.
<i>Cinq,</i>
<i>quatre,</i>
<i>trois,</i>
<i>deux, saut.</i>
On va dans la mauvaise direction.
Si on continue à ce rythme,
je ressentirai plus rien
et on pourra jamais y retourner.
Que veux-tu que je fasse ?
Que j'aille voir Laura Roslin
lui dire d'oublier la Pythie
et l'Oeil de Jupiter parce que Kara
a une intuition
sur l'emplacement de la Terre ?
Oui.
C'est impossible.
Je viens d'inspecter ton vaisseau.
Il n'a pas une seule éraflure.
Il est neuf.
Comment tu expliques ça, Kara ?
Regardez-moi.
Regardez-moi !
Je le jure devant les Dieux...
C'est moi, Kara.
J'en suis capable.
Vous disiez m'aimer comme votre fille.
Si c'est encore le cas,
faites-moi confiance.
Je ne peux pas me le permettre.
<i>Ils m'attendent.</i>
<i>Non ! Non !</i>
<i>Ils m'attendent.</i>
<i>Non ! Non !</i>
Que dois-je croire ?
Mon coeur,
ou mes yeux ?
Eh bien, tu sais ce que j'en dis.
J'ai envie de la croire.
Mais la Présidente a raison.
C'est exactement
ce que les Cylons espèrent.
Donc, tu ne changes pas de cap.
Pour le moment,
on suit les ordres de la Présidente.
Elle vit toujours dans tes quartiers ?
Jusqu'à ce qu'on trouve un endroit
où elle puisse finir
son traitement au Doloxan.
Merci d'avoir repris du service
pendant la bataille.
On avait besoin de tout le monde.
C'est toujours le cas.
Je les ai enlevées
pour de mauvaises raisons.
Remets-les.
Le procès de Baltar
a peut-être été le déclencheur, mais...
Ça fait longtemps que je ressens ça.
L'heure du changement a sonné.
Je dois passer à autre chose.
J'ai eu des contacts
avec le gouvernement.
Il y a un poste qui se présente.
Je pense que ma contribution
leur serait profitable.
Peut-être plus que dans un cockpit.
Papa, et si Zak
était revenu dans ce Viper ?
Si mon frère
s'était extirpé de ce cockpit,
ça aurait changé quelque chose
qu'il soit cylon ?
Qu'il l'ait toujours été ?
Au bout du compte...
nos sentiments
auraient-ils été différents ?
Je vous en prie, mon Dieu.
Je vous le demande
pour la dernière fois.
Ne laissez pas cet enfant mourir.
Vous a-t-il offensé ? C'est impossible.
Il ne sait encore rien de la vie.
Comment pouvez-vous le prendre
et me laisser vivre ?
Après tout ce que j'ai fait.
Vraiment,
si vous voulez que quelqu'un souffre,
prenez-moi.
Nous savons tous deux que je le mérite.
J'ai été égoïste
et faible.
J'ai déçu tant de gens.
Et j'ai tué.
Je ne demande pas votre pardon.
Je vous demande juste d'épargner
la vie de cet enfant innocent.
Ne le prenez pas.
Prenez-moi.
Prenez-moi, je vous en prie.
On a tous été très émus
par votre prière pour Derek.
Pour le bien que ça lui a fait...
Pour information, son état empire.
Ça ne signifie pas
que Dieu ne vous a pas entendu.
Je suis sûre qu'il veille
sur l'âme immortelle de Derek.
J'aimerais partager votre confiance
à ce sujet, vraiment.
Mais vous devez garder la foi.
- On compte sur vous pour nous guider...
- Eh bien, vous ne devriez pas.
Vous êtes...
Vous êtes très jeune...
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ici, au juste ?
Merci.
M. le Président.
Gaius, partons.
- On devrait rentrer, d'accord ?
- Content de vous revoir.
Désolé. Je n'arrive pas à...
On s'est rencontrés
à la cérémonie sur New Caprica.
Je vous ai présenté mon fils Kevin.
Il voulait être Président
quand il serait grand.
Vous lui avez répondu qu'il pourrait,
s'il faisait bien ses devoirs.
Un petit garçon roux, c'est ça ?
- D'environ huit ou neuf ans...
- Sept.
Sept ans.
Comment va...
Kevin.
- Comment va-t-il ?
- Il est mort.
- Votre police l'a abattu.
- Allez, Gaius, on s'en va.
- Laissez-la !
- Regarde-moi !
- Laissez-la tranquille !
- Regarde-moi !
Allez, crie.
Vas-y, crie !
Je veux voir si on te vient en aide.
Crie !
Supplie-moi.
T'as bien dû supplier les Cylons.
Pourquoi pas moi ?
Allez, supplie !
Relève-toi ! À genoux !
Debout !
Quand tu as demandé à Dieu de te prendre
à la place du garçon, c'était sincère ?
Oui.
Vas-y.
Prends ma vie.
Je t'en prie.
Je t'en prie.
Tue-moi, je t'en prie.
Vous voyez, Gaius ? Je savais
que Dieu ne vous abandonnerait pas.
J'ai senti son amour
me donner la force de les punir.
Punis-les moins la prochaine fois,
ou tu seras accusée de meurtre.
- Gaius !
- Gardez la porte.
Ça va aller ?
Je me suis coupé en me rasant.
Venez. Vous devez voir Derek.
- Derek ? Derek, oui.
- Dieu a répondu à vos prières.
- Quoi ?
- Venez voir. Regardez.
Regardez-le.
- Aucune trace de fièvre ?
- Non.
C'est un miracle.
Personne ne l'a enlevée.
Ni le Patron, ni Lee.
Pas même toi, Sam.
Tu viens de revenir, Kara.
On essaie de se faire à l'idée.
Sois indulgente avec les autres,
et avec toi-même.
Quand je...
me suis réveillée autour de la Terre,
j'ai cru à un rêve.
J'étais à la poursuite
d'un Raider lourd.
Les Cylons ont pu me sortir de là,
me capturer, me laver le cerveau.
Sur Caprica,
pendant leur expérience sur moi,
ont-ils pris des échantillons ?
C'est possible qu'ils aient fabriqué
une autre moi, dans une boîte de Petri,
ou qu'ils m'aient implanté
des souvenirs,
ou à mon autre moi, ou...
je sais pas.
Kara, non.
Écoute-moi.
Si tu es un Cylon,
alors tu l'es depuis le début.
Comme Boomer.
Une vie entière
en pensant être une chose...
Et tu te réveilles
en découvrant que t'en es une autre.
Ça ne change pas qui tu es vraiment.
Ça ne change rien au fait
que je t'aime quoi qu'il arrive.
T'es meilleur que moi, Sam,
parce que si je découvrais
que tu es un Cylon,
je te collerais une balle
entre les yeux.
<i>À tout l'équipage,
préparez-vous au saut...</i>
<i>dans quatre, trois,</i>
<i>deux...</i>
Merde, ils continuent
dans la mauvaise direction.
Un saut de plus
et j'aurai totalement perdu ma route.
On va te trouver une couchette, OK ?
Calme-toi.
C'est Roslin.
Le Patron m'écoutera si elle...
- Je dois la voir.
- Non, impossible.
- Vraiment ?
- Ouais.
Non, attends !
Qu'est-ce que tu fous, Kara ?
Où est la Présidente, Sam ?
Kara, arrête.

I think the nova does look
like the mandala inside this temple.
Maybe it was a road sign
on the path to Earth.
It was on the temple.
Where'd you get the idea to paint yours?
It was just something I've been doodling
since I was a kid, I liked the pattern.
<i>Starbuck, you're getting too low.</i>
Come on, Lee. Get her out of there.
- You come back!
- Just let me go.
<i>They're waiting for me.</i>
No!
Gaius Baltar,
after carefully weighing the evidence,
this tribunal finds you not guilty.
Get him back! Get him out of here!
Gaius, it's okay. Come with me.
- Where are you taking me to?
- To your new life. Come.
We're going to the Ionian Nebula.
Sitrep!
Sensors show major power fluctuations.
Checking on fleet.
It's true.
We're Cylons.
And we have been from the start.
Dradis contact!
Massive Cylon fleet on intercept course.
I want emergency jump, the entire fleet.
Sir, all fleet ships were powered down
during the outage.
It'll take at least 20 min
to spool up the FTL drives.
We just don't have 20 minutes.
Action stations.
Set condition 1 throughout the ship.
<i>This is not a drill. All Viper pilots
report to Vipers immediately.</i>
I have a bogey at my ten.
I'm gonna go check it out.
What the frak?!
- Hi, Lee.
- Kara?
I've been to Earth.
I know where it is.
And I'm gonna take us there.
No, this is frakkin' crazy.
I saw your ship blow up.
Afraid not.
Did you not hear me?
I've been to Earth.
Earth.
<i>Big blue oceans, fluffy white clouds.</i>
<i>You're gonna love it. I promise.</i>
Identify that ship immediately.
Sir, I'm checking
for colonial recognition codes.
- Get Lee online!
- I'm trying, sir.
- I'm picking up her ship's signature.
- That's her voice.
Hold on. It is not real.
It is a trick.
- Duplicate verification.
- Checking.
- Hostiles inbound! 200 plus!
- CAG, take 'em out!

Don't lose me this time, Apollo.
Not a chance.
Splash one!
<i>Take that, you frakkin' toasters!</i>
Admiral, it's a Cylon trick.
The Vipers have stopped
the main Cylon thrust,
but the reserves have broken through.
I want everything
that can fly up there immediately.
Saul.
Saul!
What the hell is wrong with you?
Nothing, Bill.
Never felt better in my life.
Colonel Tigh!
I gave you an order.
Everybody that's ever held a stick,
I want them up there now.
Get 'em out!
- Put 'em up there!
- Sir.
Attention. This is the XO.
Let's go! Get that bird in the tube.
Get that Showboat bird in the tube.
Where the frak are these nuggets?
Mama's not gonna save you today!
Let's go!
You want to fly or not?
Ready or not, let's go.
Hey, this is crazy.
What if another switch flips in my head
and turns me against my own?
Shut the frak up.
It's like the colonel said, okay?
Just think of that.
Be the man you want to be
till the day you die.
Easier said than done, I don't know
what the frak I am right now.
You're Samuel T. Anders.
That's all you gotta remember.
- Now get the frak in your ship.
- Who else would he be?
Hey, rook.
Stay cool out there, all right?
You'll lock in
and do what you've been trained to do.
It's just like suiting up
for a championship game, right?
Yeah, that's right. Good hunting.
If she didn't notice anything,
maybe the other Cylons won't either.
Yeah, well, don't wait to find out.
Shoot first.
Get the frak in there.
Go kill something.
Let's go! Let's load these birds!
Anders, get the frak in your Viper!
Where are you taking me?
It's a place we found.
An unused compartment.
- Sir, we've lost Pyxis!
- Oh, my Gods.
Captain Tarney.
600 souls on that ship.
How did they find us?
That's the question, isn't it?
Base ships launching missiles.
40... correction, 50 plus inbound.
Half targeted on us, half on the fleet.
Have triple-a target
only missiles going towards the fleet.
- We can handle the hits. They can't.
- Sir.
All forces, priority intercept enemy
missiles targeting civilian vessels.
I am Samuel T. Anders.
I was born on Picon.
I went to Noyce elementary school.
Get your thumb off the transmit button.
- <i>You're blocking the freq.</i>
- Copy that.
Frak me.
<i>Longshot, Hardball.</i>
Turkey, right four low at three,
committing.
<i>Longshot, I got the...</i>
Tally, I got your back.
Seelix, there's a Raider on you!
- <i>Shoot, Anders!</i>
- I'm trying to.
Gods, come on!
Sir, the Cylon strike force
has just turned back to their ships.
Base ships are spinning up.
They're pulling out.
We're gonna do the same damn thing
before they change their mind.
- Have fighters cover our withdrawal.
- Yes, sir.
All fighters assume
rear cover formation.
They had us.
Game over.
Why the hell did they let us go?
Maybe something's changed.
Like what?
I have no idea, Madame President.
No idea.

You'll be safe here, Gaius.
Right.
Chief, I'm gonna need you to develop
my gun camera footage ASAP.
I've got a hell of a set
of vacation pictures.
I'll take my post-flight checklist.
I want to sign out
so I can get in the showers.
I don't have one for you.
What's up?
Okay.
Okay, me too. It's okay, it's okay.
Do you believe in miracles?
No.
I told everyone that you were
too frakkin' mean to kill.
Okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.
I'm okay.
What the hell are you doing
in a jock smock?
I just finished Viper transition
a week ago,
and I started ACM.
How the...
Starbuck!
I did it, boss.
I found Earth.
Everybody move back.
Hit their post.
Move in.
Step away!
I need you in sickbay.
Cottle's gonna give you
a complete physical examination.
What's going on?
I'm off the ship for a few hours and...
A few hours?
Kara, you were gone for over two months.
That's impossible.
My ship's clock reads
six hours and change.
Then your clock's wrong, Kara.
Sam's telling you the truth.
We thought you were dead.
What?
Gaius, I just wanted you to know
that we'll be back soon.
Whatever you do, please don't go
anywhere by yourself. It's not safe.
Tracey's here for anything you need.
We'll be back as soon as
we've looked in on Derek. Okay?
Right... oh, Derek.
That's your little boy, isn't it?
- The one in sickbay.
- Right.
Yes, I...
I'm praying for his recovery.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank you.
- It's a pleasure.
Thank you.
So what's the game plan, ladies?
Game plan?
Well, this place is brilliant, really.
You know, it's beautiful.
Just when am I getting out of here?
When I am getting off the ship?
Well, security's too tight. Besides...
Besides what? You're just trying
to keep me here and...
None of the other ships will have you.
We'll be back.
Yesterday, you were facing execution.
Today you're free. Why the long face?
Oh, gee, I don't know.
From president of the colonies to this.
King of fools.
Probably best to be hated by everyone
than loved by this lot.
Doomed to live out the rest of my life
in this loony bin.
I don't know, that might have
something to do with my...
rather savage mood swings.
Relax, Gaius.
You think I've brought you this far
just to let it end here?
I need some encouragement.
A ray of hope about the future.
An inkling...
You've got me.
I'm here for you.
That is so beautiful.
Hello. Sorry, what?
The way you were praying.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, thank you, yeah.
Not some hollow ritual.
No,
no.
It's as if the Gods are right here
beside you.
Well, yeah.
When I pray to the Gods,
I feel...
empty.
Do you? That's a shame, isn't it?
Her gods are false.
Tell her.
Well, if you feel empty when you pray
to Zeus or Poseidon or Aphrodite,
it's because it is empty.
It's a totally empty experience.
They're...
They're not real.
They've been promulgated by...
a ruling elite...
To stop you from learning the truth.
And what truth is that?
That's a very good question.
What is the... the...
There's only one god.
There is only one god.
In a nutshell, that's the truth.
We're alone here, aren't we?
The others aren't coming back soon.
And the door's locked.
All right, good.
Can you feel God's presence?
You know what? I think I do.
- So do I.
- Do you? Do you too?
We both... we both feel...
So what's Cottle's verdict?
Everything checks out.
So I'm me,
not a Cylon?
That is why you had me tested, right?
- Kara, nobody said you were Cylon.
- But you were thinking it.
We had to be sure, Kara.
Fair enough.
Let's go through it again.
How many times do you want to hear it?
As many times as it takes to make sense.
I followed a raider into the storm.
Took some hits, passed out.
When I came to,
I was orbiting this planet.
Its yellow moon and star matches
the description in Pythia.
I took these pictures in orbit.
The star patterns match
what we saw in the tomb of Athena.
- How did you get here?
- I told you, I don't know exactly.
Well, that's just
not good enough, Captain.
Tell us everything you remember.
I remember taking the photos.
Turning my ship in a reciprocal heading.
And then I'm not sure.
I must've blacked out again.
I remember
a giant gas planet with rings.
I remember a flashing triple star.
And a comet.
And then I was back with the fleet.
And for you, all of this took six hours.
I do not understand
the time discrepancy either, okay?
All I know is I was there.
I took the pictures.
I didn't imagine it!
I had my crew clean it up.
There's not a ding or a scratch on it.
It's got the same tail number
as the one she flew out on.
But I've been fixing up that old bird
since day one,
and this thing looks like
it's been rolled off the showroom floor.
So it's not the same ship.
Unless she found a hell of a body shop
out there, no, ma'am, it's not.
Admiral,
it's just not the outside either.
This is the data from the nav computer.
There isn't any. It's blank.
There's no record
of where this ship has been.
Okay.
- Put her in the brig.
- What?
So some things don't add up, and
we're back to thinking she's a Cylon?
- What about Cottle's test?
- Cottle's test doesn't prove anything.
Even if her DNA's the same,
she could still be a Cylon.
She could've been one
from the beginning.
Baltar's Cylon detector was a crock.
It failed to i.d. Boomer.
I know how you feel about her, Bill,
but that is exactly what the Cylons
could be counting on here.
We're back where we started from.
Could be Cylons right here, we wouldn't
know till they put a bullet in our head.
Or lead us into an ambush.
That cylon fleet had enough firepower
to blow us out of the sky,
but instead they ran and jumped.
And there's Kara Thrace suddenly
back from the dead having found Earth.
If Kara Thrace
can lead us off our course...
Course? What course?
The nebula was supposed to be another
clue on the way to Earth, but it...
The nebula
is only a road sign
along the way to Earth.
And we need to continue
to follow its path.
Well, what if Kara
is the clue
that we were supposed to find?
And what if she's playing you?
And what if she's playing you?
And all of us?
Gaius, please!
Gaius, please, can you help me?
What's going on?
- Oh, god...
- Watch his head.
- It's Derek.
- Derek, is it?
Derek, I see. Where are my clothes?
- It's okay.
- Is it?
- Did they give you a diagnosis?
- They said he's got...
- viral encephalitis.
- Viral?
I don't know,
it's some inflammation of the brain.
- Can't the doctors do something?
- Well, not if it's viral, no.
I'm afraid it's up to
Derek's immune system.
And he has to be strong.
And we have to be strong for him.
I didn't want him to die
in that sickbay, so...
So I brought him here.
So he can be with us.
All of us.
- Yeah, all of us.
- Give me your hand, please.
I wish there was...
You know I prayed for him, don't you?
- I know.
- I prayed for him.
I know.
I guess...
I guess that the one true god
just doesn't want him to live, right?
Anybody still hearing
that frakkin' song?
Nope.
Maybe it stopped
when we figured out who...
What we are.
Could have been some kind of trigger?
To switch us on?
You know, after that raider
scanned me with that red light,
damn thing just cut and ran.
They all did.
You think it recognized you as a Cylon?
I don't know.
Maybe that's why it didn't shoot me.
More important,
why didn't I shoot him?
Racetrack was right.
You just made a dumb nugget mistake.
Did I?
Maybe I was programmed
to leave my gun safeties on.
Those bastards can't program me
to help them.
No way.
Boomer thought the same thing.
- And then she shot the old man.
- Boomer didn't know what she was.
We do.
That is not gonna happen.
Agreed?
I don't know why I'm here.
Yes, I do.
I'm here because of the things
that we've shared
- and the things that we've seen...
- The visions in the opera house.
You went inside.
You saw more than I did.
I thought that maybe you could help me.
Help you how?
I need to know about the other five.
The types we've never seen.
The ones that
Baltar calls the final five.
And you want to know
if Kara Thrace is one of them.
Yes.
I've been programmed
never to think about them.
Well, your programming isn't working,
because you're thinking about them
right now.
I try not to.
Trying not to is thinking about them.
How do you rationalize that?
All right, no.
Back off. Don't leave, back off.
The five are close.
What?
I can feel them.
What about this one?
It's a protoplanetary system.
So?
Nothing but rocks.
No ringed gas giants
like you claimed you saw.
- I did see it, lieutenant.
- If you say so, sir.
- And what are you saying, Mr. Gaeta?
- I'm not saying anything, sir.
- I'm just following orders.
- Well, I'm ordering you to help me.
- You're ordering me...
- Mr. Gaeta, take a break.
With pleasure, sir.
Jump clock is running, Dee.
Take us out of here.
Yes, sir.
What's going on?
I see it on his face.
On all of their faces.
They don't believe me.
You want people to believe you?
Find that star system.
It's a big waste of time.
We've only been at it a few hours.
Found maybe a dozen trinaries.
- Baltar's calculations took months.
- It doesn't work like that.
How does it work, Kara?
It's a feeling.
An intuition.
I didn't use nav fixes
to get there and back.
When we were at that nebula,
it was so clear to me.
But every jump we take farther away,
the clarity fades.
If we keep jumping like this,
I won't be able to find our way back.
That'll be all.
All hands, prepare for jump in ten...
The President's adamant.
We're gonna continue on the course
laid out by the Eye of Jupiter.
<i>Five,</i>
<i>four,</i>
<i>three,</i>
<i>two, jump.</i>
We're going the wrong way.
If we keep jumping,
I'll lose the feeling completely
and I'll never be able to take us back.
What do you want me to do?
You want me to go to Laura Roslin,
tell her forget Pythia
and the Eye of Jupiter, because Kara
has some feeling about where Earth is?
Yes.
I can't.
I just left your ship.
There's not a scratch on it.
It's brand-new.
How do you explain that, Kara?
Look at me.
Look at me!
I swear to Gods...
It's me, Kara.
I can do this.
You said you loved me
like a daughter.
If you still do,
you've gotta trust me on this one.
I can't afford to.
<i>They're waiting for me.</i>
<i>No! No!</i>
<i>They're waiting for me.</i>
<i>No! No!</i>
What should I believe?
Should I believe my heart?
Or my eyes?
Well, you know where I stand.
I want to believe her.
But the President's right.
It's exactly what the Cylons
would be counting on.
So I guess you're not changing course.
For the time being,
we follow the President's lead.
She's still staying in your quarters?
Just till we find a place to put her up,
to finish the rest
of her Doloxan treatment.
I want to thank you
for suiting up during the fight.
We needed everyone up there.
We still do.
I took those off for the wrong reasons.
Put them back on.
Baltar's trial
may have been the trigger, but...
This is a feeling
I've been having for a while.
It's time for a change.
I need to move on.
I've had some feelers
from the government.
There's a position opening up.
And I think I can make
a valuable contribution there.
Maybe even more than in the cockpit.
Dad, what if Zak
had come back to us in that Viper?
If my brother
had climbed out of that cockpit...
Would it matter if he were a Cylon?
If he always had been?
When all's said and done...
would that change
how we really feel about him?
Please, God.
I'm only asking you this one last time.
Don't let this child die.
Has he sinned against you?
He can't have sinned against you.
He's not even had a life yet.
How can you take him and let me live?
After all I've done.
Really, if you want someone to suffer,
take me.
We both know I deserve it.
I have been selfish
and weak.
I have failed so many people.
And I have killed.
I'm not asking for your forgiveness.
I'm just asking
that you spare the life
of this innocent child.
Don't take him.
Take me.
Take me, take me please.
We were all very moved
by the way you prayed for Derek.
Fat lot of good it did him.
Unfortunately, he's worse,
if you hadn't realized.
Doesn't mean God didn't hear you.
I'm sure he's looking
after Derek's immortal soul.
Yes, I wish I shared your confidence
on that one. I really do.
But you have to keep the faith.
- We all look to you for guidance...
- Well, you shouldn't, should you?
I mean, you're just...
Well, you're very young and...
What are we doing here exactly?
Thank you.
Mr. President.
Gaius, let's go.
- We should get back, okay?
- Good to see you again.
I'm sorry. I can't...
We met at the groundbreaking ceremony
on New Caprica.
Introduced you to my son Kevin.
He told you he wanted to be President
when he grew up.
You told him that he could be
if he stuck to his schoolwork.
He's a redhead little boy, isn't he?
- About eight or nine years old...
- Seven.
Seven years old.
How is...
Kevin.
- How is he?
- He's dead.
- Your police shot him.
- Come on, Gaius, let's get out of here.
- Leave her alone!
- Look at me!
- Leave her alone!
- Look at me!
Go on, scream.
Come on, scream!
I want to see
if anyone comes to help you.
Scream!
Beg.
I bet you begged the Cylons.
Why don't you beg for me?
Come on, beg!
Get up! Get on your knees!
Get up!
You asked God to take your life
instead of the boy's.
Did you mean it?
Yes.
Do it.
Take my life.
Please.
Please.
Please take my life.
You see?
Gaius, I knew God wouldn't desert you.
I felt his love course through me,
giving me the strength to smite them.
Less smiting next time, unless you want
to be held up on murder charges.
- Gaius!
- You two, watch the door.
Are you all right?
I cut myself shaving.
Well, you have to come.
You have to come and see Derek.
- Derek? Derek, yes.
- God answered your prayers.
- What?
- You have to see. Look.
Look at him.
- And no trace of a fever.
- No.
It's a miracle.
No one took it down.
Not the old man, not Lee.
Not even you, Sam.
You just got back, Kara.
We're trying to get a handle on this.
You gotta cut people some slack.
Cut yourself some too.
When I...
woke up orbiting earth, I just figured
it was some crazy dream, but...
I went in following a Heavy Raider.
I mean, maybe the Cylons
pulled me out of the soup,
captured me, brainwashed me.
On Caprica,
when they experiment on me,
did they take pieces of me?
Is it possible that they grew me,
another me in a petri dish,
or they embedded me with the memories
or it with the memories, or...
I don't know.
Kara, no.
Listen to me.
If you were a Cylon,
then you've been one from the beginning.
Like Boomer.
Spend my entire life
thinking I'm one thing...
Yeah, and then you wake up one day
and discover you're another.
It still doesn't change
who you really are.
It still doesn't change the fact
that I love you no matter what.
You are a better person than I am, Sam,
because if I found out
that you were a Cylon,
I would put a bullet between your eyes.
<i>All hands, prepare for jump</i>
<i>in four, three,</i>
<i>two,</i>
Damn it, they're still going
in the wrong direction.
One more jump
and I'm gonna lose my way altogether.
All right, we gotta find you a rack.
Okay, take it easy.
It's Roslin. The old man is not
gonna listen to me as long as she's...
- I gotta get to her.
- You can't do that.
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.
No, no, wait!
What the hell are you doing, Kara?
Where's the president, Sam?
Kara, come on.

DOUZE MODÈLES CYLONS
SEPT SONT CONNUS
QUATRE VIVENT EN SECRET
LE DERNIER SERA RÉVÉLÉ
<i>Précédemment dans</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
Aurora, déesse de l'aube.
Ça ferait une belle figure de proue
pour votre maquette.
- Un nouveau départ.
- Merci.
- <i>Starbuck, tu descends trop bas !</i>
- Allez, Lee. Sors-la de là.
- Reviens !
- Laisse-moi partir.
Non !
Le procès de Baltar
a peut-être été le déclencheur,
mais ça fait longtemps
que je ressens ça.
L'heure du changement a sonné.
Je vous en prie, mon Dieu.
Ne laissez pas cet enfant mourir.
Comment pouvez-vous le prendre
et me laisser vivre ?
Dieu a répondu à vos prières.
Venez voir.
- Regardez-le.
- Aucune trace de fièvre.
C'est un miracle.
Je dois savoir qui sont les cinq autres.
Les modèles que nous n'avons jamais vus.
C'est vrai. On est des Cylons.
Et on l'a toujours été.
Après que ce Raider m'ait scanné
avec sa lumière rouge,
cette saloperie a dégagé.
Il aurait détecté que t'étais un Cylon ?
C'est peut-être pour ça
qu'il a pas tiré. Mais surtout,
pourquoi j'ai pas tiré ?
C'est quoi ce bordel ?
- Je pars quelques heures et...
- Quelques heures ?
Kara, tu es partie
depuis plus de deux mois.
C'est impossible.
- Comment êtes-vous revenue ?
- Je l'ai déjà dit, je ne sais pas.
Merde, ils continuent
dans la mauvaise direction.
Un saut de plus
et j'aurai perdu ma route.
C'est Roslin.
Le Patron m'écoutera pas...
Je dois la voir.
Non, attends !
Plus vite que ça ! Et par pitié,
ne butez pas la Présidente !
Laissez-moi lui parler.
D'accord,
mais au 1er coup de feu, on arrête.
<i>On descend.
Starbuck retient la Présidente.</i>
Gaeta, prenez les coms.
Par là.
Par là !
Allez.
Dépêchez-vous !
Près du canapé.
Tout de suite !
J'ai tellement envie de vous détester.
Tellement.
Vous avez eu une vision,
vous vous souvenez ?
La flèche, le temple.
Je suis allée sur cette planète
avec vous,
et c'était la foire aux Cylons.
Plein de gens bien sont morts,
vous vous souvenez ?
Je m'en souviens.
Je vous ai fait confiance...
sur une vision.
Eh oui...
une simple vision !
J'ai vu...
la Terre.
Je l'ai vue de mes propres yeux.
Et elle me rappelle à elle.
On va dans la mauvaise direction.
Pourquoi vous me faites pas confiance ?
Tuez-moi.
Si je suis un Cylon,
alors je suis votre ennemie.
Tuez votre ennemie.
Prenez-le !
Je suis pas plus un Cylon que vous.
Et vous le savez.
J'aimerais le savoir.
J'ai risqué ma vie
pour ce putain de vaisseau.
J'ai mangé, dormi et combattu
aux côtés de ceux que j'aime.
J'ai fait chier mes amis !
J'ai constamment violé les règles !
J'ai merdé, d'accord ! J'ai tout foiré !
Mais c'est tout ce que j'ai.
Ces gens sont ma famille.
Aucun d'entre nous n'a sa place ici.
Deux hommes à terre !
Tuez-moi !
Si je suis un Cylon, tuez-moi !
Vous êtes un modèle parfait,
n'est-ce pas ?
À terre, tout de suite !
- Tout de suite !
- Lâchez-moi !
Lâchez-moi !
Tu fous quoi ?
Je suis pas un Cylon, Mathias !
- Madame la Présidente.
- Par les Dieux !
C'est quoi, ça ?
Vous deviez vous en charger !
Elle a pété les plombs.
- Ça va ?
- Lâchez-moi !
Lâchez-moi !
Écoutez-moi, je vous en supplie.
Je le perds.
Le son...
Le chemin vers la Terre...
Il s'affaiblit.
Vous ne comprenez pas ?
Personne ne comprend ?
Il était... Il était tellement clair.
Comme s'il venait de la pièce d'à côté.
Arrêtez de me regarder comme ça.
Je le sens qui m'échappe.
Même sans sauter, en ce moment même,
il est deux fois moins puissant
qu'à mon arrivée.
Deux fois moins.
Si on continue à sauter, il disparaîtra,
et on ne le retrouvera plus jamais.
C'est pas ce qu'on voulait ?
Le chemin vers la Terre.
- Vous m'entendez ?
- Faites-la sortir.
- Bien, Colonel.
- Entraînez-vous à viser,
parce que je n'arrêterai pas !
Faudra me tuer !
Encore un saut, et il disparaîtra !
Amiral !

39 676 SURVIVANTS
À LA RECHERCHE D'UN FOYER
APPELÉ LA TERRE
- =( Lords of Kobol )= -
L'état excité est dégradé
par relaxation vibrationnelle
vers son état fondamental.
Oui, oui, et gaiement nous allons.
Réduisez l'azote atmosphérique
de 0,03 %.
Il est peu réconfortant de savoir
que la société recollera les morceaux,
nous laissant à huit modernes,
où le châtiment,
plus que l'interdiction, est primordial.
Coupez le courant.
Ils ne feront pas de mal aux leurs.
Fin de ligne.
Limiter les diffusions à deux dimensions
augmente le nombre
de bonds dans l'évolution des espèces.
Levez-vous
et examinez le temple des Cinq.
La transformation est le but.
Ils ne feront pas de mal aux leurs.
Synchronisation des données achevée.
L'hybride essaie
de nous dire quelque chose.
Ils le font toujours.
Ils sont censés gérer les opérations
sur les vaisseaux,
pas déblatérer de la métaphysique.
Très bien,
j'abandonne.
Qu'essaie-t-elle de nous dire ?
Ils sont avec la flotte coloniale...
avec les humains.
"Ils" ?
Qui ça, "ils" ?
Les Cinq derniers.
Les Raiders refusent le combat,
car ils sentent que les Cinq
pourraient être avec la flotte.
Ils ont pu se faire capturer
ou bien ils se cachent.
Non, on arrête.
On arrête, là.
Sortez, allez vous aérer l'esprit,
et j'essaierai d'oublier
ce que je viens d'entendre.
Les cinq derniers, Cavil, ils sont là.
C'est bien trop important.
- Ce qu'ils ont pu voir tout ce temps...
- Vous pensez qu'ils nous ressemblent ?
Ça suffit !
Ne voyez-vous pas ce que vous faites ?
Vous parlez d'eux ouvertement !
C'est interdit !
Vous jouez avec notre survie.
Regardez-vous.
Des millions de numéros 2 ont ce nez.
Des millions de 6 ont cette bouche.
Les 8 partagent cette poitrine,
les 1 ont ce cerveau.
Nous sommes fabriqués en série.
Les programmeurs avaient
une bonne raison de penser
que c'est une faute pour nous
de contacter les Cinq !
- Non !
- En violant ce programme,
nous menaçons notre survie !
Quelque chose a changé.
Les mentalités ont changé.
Oui, les Raiders ont bien changé.
Ça a commencé avec eux.
Ils ont outrepassé leur programmation,
mais contrairement à nous,
ils ne peuvent se corriger.
- Nous devons donc le faire pour eux.
- Faire quoi ?
Nous allons reconfigurer
leur système nerveux,
et réduire leurs réponses heuristiques.
Les abrutir ? Les lobotomiser ?
Ce sont des outils, pas des animaux.
Mais de toute façon, il faut le faire.
Selon qui ?
Selon Dieu tout-puissant,
la voix de la raison !
Quand allez-vous le comprendre ?
Tu n'as pas le droit de changer
quoi que ce soit
sans la majorité des voix.
Votons.
Les 4 et les 5 seront de mon côté.
Nous allons voter. Les Raiders
entendent ce que nous entendons.
Ce sont de simples machines.
Non.
Quelque chose d'extraordinaire
est arrivé et nous appelle,
nous pousse à découvrir nos origines,
à trouver notre place dans l'univers.
Les Raiders en font partie,
et les Cinq...
Ne sont pas parmi les humains.
Vous êtes en retard.
J'attendais que Callie s'endorme.
- Elle dort mal.
- T'as vu Kara ?
Moi oui.
Elle est folle comme un rat en cage.
Elle est plus elle-même que jamais.
C'est ma femme !
La présidente a failli lui tirer dessus,
car elle la soupçonnait d'être un Cylon.
Tu en es un !
Si on attire l'attention, on est foutus.
Si Starbuck est des nôtres,
elle le cache bien.
On a tous entendu la musique
et on s'est trouvés.
Pas elle.
Il en manque toujours un.
Baltar.
Pas Baltar, mais...
quand je l'ai trouvé dans le temple
sur la planète aux algues,
il était avec une de ces synthétiques.
Celle qu'ils appellent D'Anna.
Elle a vu quelque chose.
Je sais pas quoi, mais ils ont parlé.
Il sait peut-être quelque chose.
Il y a ces...
barjots monothéistes
qui le prennent pour un guérisseur.
Il a sorti un gamin du coma.
Il sait peut-être qui est le cinquième.
Il sait peut-être qui on est.
Alors, on doit aller le voir.
Et on fait ça comment, d'après vous ?
On l'invite à boire un verre ?
Il est très doué pour deux choses.
Coucher en cellule et avec les femmes.
Il se taperait une synthétique.
Il s'est fait une 6... C'est connu.
C'est hors de question.
Pas besoin de vous allonger
pour lui, mais...
Vraiment ? Merci.
Qu'est-ce que tu faisais ?
À quoi tu pensais ?
Qu'est-ce qui t'est arrivé ?
J'ai vu...
la Terre.
Son apparence, son odeur.
Cette sensation
dans les pores de ma peau.
Je vous le jure,
comme si j'y étais déjà allée.
Comme si j'étais jamais partie.
Tu es trop bête pour comprendre
que tu viens de perdre ton unique allié.
Tu n'avais pas les tripes de te retenir.
Dis-moi...
Qui va t'aider ?
Ouais, je suis foutue, hein ?
En tout cas, ça sera pas vous.
Souvenez-vous
que vous êtes quelqu'un d'autre.
Vous êtes la nounou de la Présidente.
C'est vous qui n'avez pas les tripes.
Ravie de voir que ça vous touche encore.
On se plante de route !
Après délibération avec nos modèles,
voici les résultats.
Les numéros 4 et 5 nous ont rejoints :
ils ont voté
pour la reconfiguration des Raiders.
Quelle surprise...
Les numéros 2, 6 et 8 ont voté contre.
On est dans l'impasse.
Désespérant... Mais tu avais raison.
Ma nature mécanique me permet
- d'admettre mon erreur.
- Qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?
Quelque chose d'extraordinaire
est arrivé.
Numéro 8.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Boomer.
Je ne vais pas y aller
par quatre chemins.
Cette numéro 8
a voté pour la reconfiguration.
- Quoi ?
- Choquée ? Moi aussi, ça m'a choqué.
Personne n'a jamais voté
contre son modèle.
Personne. C'est vrai ?
On doit pouvoir se défendre.
Non, c'est totalement insensé.
Elle ne peut pas faire ça.
- Tu y es pour quelque chose.
- Non, c'est sa propre décision.
- Vous pouvez pas autoriser ça.
- Il n'y a ni loi ni décret.
Rien ne l'interdit.
C'est simplement que...
c'était jamais arrivé avant.
Tâche de ne pas oublier tes paroles
quand il désactivera ton modèle.
- Sois bonne perdante.
- Si tu le fais, on sera tous perdants.
- C'est ce qu'il y a de mieux à faire.
- De mieux ?
Tu as perdu la tête ?
Notre modèle détermine notre identité.
Chaque modèle est unique.
Nous ne faisons qu'un.
Tu sais ça mieux que quiconque.
"Fabriqués en série"
- Ce sont tes propres mots.
- "Quelque chose a changé."
Ce sont tes propres mots.
Et je suis complètement d'accord.
Les Raiders ont une conscience,
comme nous.
Notre conception suivait un plan divin.
- Vous les charcutez.
- On les reconfigure.
Tu n'es pas Dieu.
Non... je suis mécanicien.
Les Raiders ont été conçus
pour une tâche précise.
Ils ne l'accomplissent plus.
Je les répare.
Quand on en aura fini,
ils redeviendront de joyeux guerriers.
On n'en parle plus, entendu ?
Je vais prier pour toi,
de toutes mes forces.
Bon, bande de soûlards !
Fermez-la !
Il est temps... Fermez vos gueules !
Écoutez tous.
Saluons le départ...
du plus grand crack
que vos faces de pets verront jamais...
Ferme-la.
Major ?
- Allez !
- Allez !
- J'ai déjà un verre.
- C'est parti. Amène-toi.
J'ai pas soif.
Au Galactica !
Aux hommes et aux femmes du Galactica.
À l'Amiral...
... qui commande les hommes
et les femmes du Galactica.
Et à nos amours, maris et femmes !
À nos amours !
À nos amis absents.
Merci.
C'est très gentil.
Vous voulez bien m'excuser ?
Regarde où tu vas.
- Tu disais ?
- Pardon.
Vous m'espionnez, Tory.
Je vous ai repérée.
Non. J'ai entendu parler du miracle.
L'enfant ?
Oui.
Vous voulez dire
que Roslin en a entendu parler.
Très bien, je vous espionnais.
Heureusement que j'étais assis !
J'ai observé ces gens
et leur manière de vous regarder.
Si vous balancez à la Présidente
que ma récente popularité
frise les sommets,
- elle va se faire un sang d'encre.
- Je suis ici de mon propre chef.
Et j'ai couché avec votre patronne
cette nuit.
Sois gentil.
- Qu'est-ce que ça te coûte ?
- Mon Dieu.
- C'est pas vrai !
- Reprends-toi, Gaius.
Elle ment pas. Et elle pourrait faire
une source d'info inestimable.
- Tu devrais tâter le terrain.
- Tâter quoi ?
- Quoi ?
- Je ne vous parle pas.
Essaie de m'oublier un peu.
- Demande-lui ce qu'elle fait là.
- Je suis à vous.
- Que faites-vous là ?
- C'était peut-être une erreur.
Je n'arrête pas de penser
à ce qui s'est passé.
Vous avez été innocenté
alors que tous vous haïssaient,
moi la première.
Et il y a cette guérison
et le retour de Kara Thrace...
Tout le monde la croyait morte.
- Peut-être que les miracles existent.
- Peut-être.
Ce qui est sûr, c'est qu'à chaque fois
vous y êtes mêlé.
Oui, c'est vrai.
En toute honnêteté,
même moi, je ne comprends pas.
On dirait...
que Dieu m'a choisi pour...
chanter sa chanson.
- Une chanson ?
- Musique, vous avez dit musique ?
C'est drôle, vous savez,
ça y ressemble beaucoup.
C'est comme
le tumulte distant d'un orchestre
qui s'accorde.
Et puis,
quelqu'un agite une baguette magique,
et toutes ces notes
commencent à s'ajuster.
Cette cacophonie
grotesque et dissonante
se transforme en mélodie.
On ne doit pas me voir ici.
T'es qui, putain ?
C'est censé m'impressionner ?
Tu es moi.
De toute évidence, tu es moi, alors...
À moins que tu ne sois pas moi.
Six ?
Est-ce toi, Six,
mais déguisée ?
Et pourquoi aurait-elle besoin
de se cacher de toi ?
- Très bonne remarque.
- Parlons de Tory.
- Où est-elle ?
- Il faut qu'on parle de Tory.
On sait tous les deux
quelle direction ça prend.
Tu l'aimes bien, n'est-ce pas ?
Oui, c'est une...
- C'est une femme attirante.
- C'est vrai.
Sexy.
- Vraiment, tu me tues, Gaius.
- Pourquoi ça ?
Elle est beaucoup plus que ça.
Elle est spéciale.
Et tu le sens.
Oui, fragile.
Oui, je le devine aussi.
Tu es très observateur.
Fragile.
- À manipuler avec précaution.
- J'adorerais ça.
Tu bois beaucoup plus que d'habitude.
Remède contre la gueule de bois.
La fête de Lee.
Et maintenant ?
On la traduit en justice ?
On trouve Romo Lampkin ?
On vote à main levée ?
Je ne sais pas.
On la laisse nous mener dans un piège.
- Elle est déterminée.
- Oui.
Tu continues à faire les cent pas
ou tu t'assois pour qu'on parle ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ? Assieds-toi.
Et si elle disait la vérité ?
Elle aurait dû mourir.
Or, elle est en vie et ça m'échappe.
Et si elle était censée nous aider ?
Et qu'il s'agissait d'un...
D'un quoi ?
D'un miracle ?
C'est le mot que tu veux employer ?
Allez, dis-le.
Prends ta part de la flèche d'or.
Je veux entendre
l'Amiral athée dire
qu'un miracle s'est produit.
Tu lui as tiré dessus de très près
et tu as manqué.
Le Doloxan pourrit la visée.
Le doute aussi.
J'ai appuyé sur la détente
et je le referais.
Elle a placé sa vie face à une balle
comme si elle n'avait aucun sens.
Si tu laisses tomber un oeuf,
prends-en un autre.
Te convaincre comptait peut-être plus
que sa propre vie.
C'est ça, ton miracle ?
Tu veux qu'on parle de miracles ?
Le jour même
où un médecin blême m'a annoncé
que j'étais en phase terminale,
l'essentiel de l'humanité a été détruit,
et j'ai survécu.
Et par quelque absurdité mathématique,
je suis devenue présidente.
Ensuite,
mon cancer a disparu
assez longtemps pour qu'on trouve
une route vers la Terre.
Appelle ça comme tu veux.
Et maintenant,
je suis en train de mourir.
- Ne parle pas comme ça.
- Bill...
Tu vas devoir y faire face.
Très bientôt, ma vie va s'achever,
et je ne m'excuserai pas
de ne pas lui faire confiance.
Et je ne...
Je ne lui confierai pas
le destin de cette flotte.
Tu réprimes tout à l'intérieur...
Tu n'en peux plus de toutes ces pertes.
Ton fils s'en va...
Ça, moi... Je le sais.
Personne ne s'en va.
OK...
Voilà la vérité.
Voilà ce qui se passe.
Tu as envie de croire Kara.
Tu préfèrerais te tromper sur elle,
et être confronté à ta propre fin,
que de risquer de la perdre à nouveau.
Tu peux rester dans cette pièce,
mais sors de ma tête.
Tu as tellement peur de vivre seul.
Et toi, de mourir de cette façon.
Tu as peur de ne pas être
le leader agonisant que tu croyais.
Ou que ta mort soit...
aussi insignifiante
que celle des autres.
Zarek a proposé mon nom
pour le poste vacant du Quorum.
Te voilà ailier de Zarek.
C'est bon, ça suffit, OK ?
On me l'a déjà dit.
Je sais que ce type est insupportable.
Sa tête a la taille
de la maison où j'ai grandi mais...
Tout ça, c'est nouveau pour moi.
Son aide peut m'être utile.
En plus, je n'ai jamais su dire "non".
Sauf à moi.
Surtout à toi.
Je crois que j'ai enfin compris
ce que tu voulais dire
sur le fait d'avoir un destin.
Il faut que je le fasse.
Et mon incapacité
à expliquer pourquoi...
n'a plus vraiment d'importance.
Ainsi soit-il.
Ainsi soit-il.
Bonne chance pour la suite, Lee Adama.
À toi aussi, Kara Thrace.
Bon...
Lee...
Je te crois.
<i>Les sections rouge et bleue
commenceront, jaune et verte suivront.</i>
<i>Starbuck, si t'as un problème,
je veux pas le savoir.</i>
<i>Mon seul problème, c'est que t'aies pas
fait ce sermon il y a une semaine.</i>
<i>Au moindre contact cylon,
arrêtez tout et filez.</i>
<i>- Questions ?
- Vous revenez jouer aux cartes quand ?</i>
<i>- Y a une partie demain soir !
- Bon, d'accord.</i>
<i>Bonne chance et soyez prudents.</i>
À mon commandement !
En reconnaissance
de bons et loyaux services,
Madame la Présidente,
Amiral de la flotte coloniale,
Mesdames et Messieurs...
Le Major Lee Adama...
Garde-à-vous !
Bonne chance.
Merci.
C'est toi qui gardes la maison,
on dirait.
Tu vas me manquer.
Au revoir, Lee.
Prends soin de toi.
Arrête de lobotomiser les Raiders,
Cavil.
Le libre arbitre pour les Raiders ?
C'est hors de question.
Tu sais ce qui m'emmerde le plus ?
Tu m'as pointé du doigt,
m'accusant à tort de manipulation.
De tyrannie, presque.
Alors que c'est toi
qui sonnes la charge ici.
Nous voulons que ça cesse.
Ce n'est pas toi qui commandes.
Nous avons voté.
Pour la dernière fois,
vas-tu cesser
de lobotomiser les Raiders ?
C'est incroyable, non ? Incroyable.
Pour la dernière fois,
non.
J'avais peur que tu dises ça.
Entrez.
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Les centurions ne votent pas, 6.
Ils ne sont pas là pour voter, Cavil.
- Je te fais mal ?
- Non.
- Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
- Rien.
"Rien" ? Tu pleures !
Je fais toujours ça pendant l'amour.
- Tout le temps ?
- Oui.
Je suis désolée.
Ne le sois pas.
Pourquoi t'excuser ?
Tu devrais être reconnaissante.
Tu es pleine d'émotions.
Je ne l'avais jamais vu comme ça.
Tu es bénie, non ?
Je ne sais pas.
J'imagine.
Je suppose que je ne pourrais pas
être un Cylon.
Ça, je n'en sais rien.
Les humains n'ont pas le monopole
de la souffrance.
Les Cylons ont des sentiments.
- Tu crois ça ?
- À dire vrai, oui.
J'ai passé du temps parmi eux.
L'Homme les a fabriqués,
mais Dieu est au début de la chaîne.
C'est Dieu qui a créé l'âme.
Le seul vrai Dieu.
Le seul Dieu ?
Le seul vrai Dieu.
Je suis de plus en plus fatigué
de garder ça pour moi.
De nier cette vérité essentielle.
Ce n'est pas drôle.
Sortez.
J'ai dit : "Sortez" !
Pourquoi restent-ils ?
L'inhibiteur téléencéphalique
qui restreint les fonctions évoluées
des Centurions...
- On l'a fait enlever.
- Quoi ?
Vous abrutissez les Raiders.
Les Leoben et les Sharon ont doté
les Centurions de la faculté de penser.
Vous n'en avez pas l'autorité.
On ne peut rien faire sans vote !
On ne peut rien faire avec,
donc on ne vote plus.
Qu'avez-vous fait ?
Ils ont appris
ce que vous faisiez aux Raiders.
Imaginez leur réaction.
Non.
Monsieur, la flotte est prête à sauter.
Exécutez le saut.
Faites demi-tour !
Faites demi-tour...
Ouvrez.
Menottez-la.
Donc...
Vous vous débarrassez
tranquillement de moi dans l'espace
J'ai pas peur de mourir.
C'est plus facile la deuxième fois.
Au contraire.
Surtout maintenant que les choses
m'apparaissent si clairement.
Vous faites une erreur.
Peut-être bien.
Mais je ne peux prendre le risque
que tu aies raison et ne rien faire.
Helo t'a recruté un équipage.
Je te donne un vaisseau.
J'espère que tu supporteras l'odeur.
On a libéré le Demetrius.
Un vaisseau de recyclage des eaux usées.
Officiellement,
c'est une mission de reconnaissance.
Recherche de vivres.
Alors, vous me croyez.
Peut-être, peut-être pas.
Mais je sais que la Présidente a raison.
Elle a toujours eu raison.
J'en ai assez de perdre.
Assez de tourner le dos
à ce que je veux croire.
Et je te crois quand tu dis
que tu mourras avant d'arrêter.
Et je ne veux pas te perdre à nouveau.
Maintenant, pars.
Trouve la route de la Terre.

<i>Previously on</i> Battlestar Galactica...
Aurora, Goddess of the dawn.
I thought  it would be a nice figurehead
for your model ship.
- A fresh start.
- Thank you.
- <i>Starbuck, you're getting too low!</i>
- Come on, Lee, get her out of there.
- You come back!
- Just let me go.
No!
Baltar's trial
may have been the trigger,
but this is a feeling
I've been having for a while.
It's time for a change.
Please, God, don't let this child die.
How can you take him and let me live?
God answered your prayers.
You have to see.
- Look at him.
- And no trace of a fever.
No.
It's a miracle.
I need to know about the other five.
The types we've never seen.
It's true.
We're Cylons.
And we have been from the start.
Even after that Raider scanned me
with that red light,
damn thing just cut and ran.
You think it recognized you as a Cylon?
Maybe that's why it didn't shoot me.
More important,
why didn't I shoot him?
Okay, what the hell's going on?
- I'm off the ship for a few hours...
- A few hours?
Kara, you were gone for over two months.
That's impossible.
How did you get here?
I told you, I don't know exactly.
Damn it, they're still going
in the wrong direction.
One more jump and I'm gonna lose
my way altogether.
It's Roslin.
The old man's not gonna listen to me.
I gotta get to her.
No, wait!
Look alive! And for frak sake,
don't shoot the godsdamned President!
Just let me talk to her.
Talk all you want,
but it ends with the first bang.
<i>We're rollin' down here.
Starbuck's got the President.</i>
Gaeta, take the com.
Move.
Move!
Come on.
Move, come on!
Over by the couch.
Now!
I want to hate you so much.
So much.
You had a vision, remember?
The arrow, the temple.
I went down to that planet with you,
and it was a frakkin' toaster party.
A lot of good people died, remember?
Yes, I do.
I trusted you.
On a vision.
That's it...
a vision!
I saw...
Earth.
I saw it with my own eyes.
And it's calling me back.
We're going the wrong way.
Why can't you trust me?
Shoot me.
If you think I'm a Cylon,
them I'm your enemy.
Shoot your enemy.
Take it!
I'm no more a Cylon than you are.
And you know it.
I wish I did.
I've put my life on the line
for this frakkin' ship.
I have ate, slept, and fought
next to the people that I love.
I have pissed off my friends!
I have broken more rules
than I've followed!
I frakked up, okay! I messed up!
But it's all that I have.
Those people are my family.
And none of us belong here.
Two down. We've got two down!
Shoot me!
If I'm a Cylon, shoot me!
They made you perfect, didn't they?
Down on the floor now!
- Now!
- Let go of me!
Get off me! Get off me!
What are you doing?
I am not a Cylon, Mathias!
- Madam President.
- Gods!
What the frak's going on here?
I thought you were on the move.
She's out of her frakkin' mind.
Gods!
- You all right?
- Get off me!
Get off!
Listen to me, please.
I'm losing it.
The ringing...
The way to Earth...
It's getting weaker.
Don't you understand?
Don't any of you understand?!
It was so... It was so clear.
Like it was coming from the next room.
Stop looking at me like that.
I can feel it slipping away.
Even without jumping, as we move,
it's half of what it was
when I got here.
Half.
If we keep jumping, it'll be gone,
and we'll never find it again.
I thought that's what we wanted.
A way to Earth.
- Do you hear me?
- Get her out of here.
- Yes, sir. Let's go!
- You better work on your aim,
because I'm not gonna stop!
You're gonna have to kill me!
One more jump and it'll be gone!
Admiral!

The excited state decays
by vibrational relaxation
into the first excited singlet state.
Yes, yes, and merrily we go.
Reduce atmospheric nitrogen by 0.03%.
It is not much consolation
that society will pick up the bits,
leaving us at eight modern
where punishment,
rather than interdiction, is paramount.
Please, cut the fuse.
They will not harm their own.
End of line.
Limiting diffusions to two dimensions
increases the number of
evolutionary jumps within the species.
Rise and measure the temple of the five.
Transformation is the goal.
They will not harm their own.
Datafont synchronization complete.
The hybrid
is clearly telling us something.
The hybrid
is always telling us something.
They're supposed to maintain operations
on each ship,
not vomit metaphysics.
All right,
I give up. What...
What is she trying to tell us?
They're in the colonial fleet...
With the humans.
"They"?
They who?
The Final Five.
The Raiders refuse to fight
because they sense
the Final Five might be
- in the colonial fleet.
- They could have been caught or hiding.
No way, stop.
Stop, right now.
Turn around,
go and take a cleansing walk,
and I am gonna try
and forget what I just heard.
The Final Five... Cavil, they're near.
This is far too important.
What their eyes must have seen,
witnessed over time...
- Think they look anything like us?
- That's enough!
Don't you realize what you're doing?
You're openly discussing the Final Five!
That's forbidden!
You're toying with our survival.
Look at yourselves.
Look,
there's millions of Twos have that nose.
Millions of Sixes possess that mouth.
Eights share those breasts,
and Ones have this brain.
We're mechanized copies.
There's a reason
the original programmers clearly felt
that it's a mistake
for us to contact the Final Five!
- No!
- Violating that programming
threatens our survival!
Something has changed.
Thoughts have changed.
Yes, they change. The Raiders changed.
That's where all this started,
with them.
Somehow they exceeded their programming,
and unlike us,
they can't correct themselves.
So we're gonna have to do it for them.
Do what?
We'll reconfigure
their neural architecture,
and shave down
their heuristic responses.
Dumb them down? Lobotomize them?
They're tools, not pets.
But in any case, it has to be done.
Says who?
Says God almighty,
the voice of reason, that's who!
When are you gonna hear it?
You don't have the authority to make
any change without a majority vote.
Well, we'll vote.
The Fours and Fives will be on my side.
There will be a vote.
The Raiders hear what we hear.
The Raiders are simple machines.
No.
Something extraordinary has happened.
Something is calling to us.
Pushing us to discover our origins,
to understand our place in the universe.
The Raiders are part of that,
and the Final Five...
Are anywhere but with the humans.
You're late.
I had to wait
for Cally to nod off, okay?
- She's having trouble sleeping.
- Did you see Kara?
I saw her. She's crazy as a latrine rat.
If anything,
she's more like Starbuck than ever.
She's my wife!
And the President nearly
put a bullet in her skull
because she suspected her
of being a Cylon.
You are one!
We bring attention to ourselves,
we're frakked!
If Starbuck is one of us,
she's playing it big the other way.
The four of us heard the music
and sought each other out.
She hasn't.
We're still missing one.
Baltar.
Not Baltar, but...
when I found him
in the temple on the algae planet,
he was with one of those skin jobs.
The one they call D'Anna.
She saw something in there...
I don't know what. But they talked.
He might know something.
He's got those
one-God nutcases
believing he's some kind of healer.
He brought some boy out from a coma.
Maybe he knows who the fifth is.
Maybe he knows who we are.
Then we gotta get in close and find out.
How do you propose we do that?
Take him out for drinks?
Well, he is accomplished at two things.
Lying in his cell, and lying in a woman.
He'd poke a skin job.
He racked up a Six... That's a given.
There is no way.
You don't have to get
on your back for him, but...
Oh, gee, thanks.
What were you doing?
What were you thinking?
What happened to you?
I saw...
Earth.
The shape of it, the smell of it.
The feel of it on my skin in my pores.
And I swear to you,
it was like I'd been there before.
Like I never left.
You're too stupid to figure out
you just screwed over
the one ally you had.
You didn't have the guts to hold on.
Tell me...
Who's gonna help you?
Yeah, frak me, huh?
It sure as hell isn't gonna be you.
You've gotta remind yourself
that you're somebody else.
You're the President's wet nurse.
You're the one
who doesn't have the guts.
Nice to know you still care, Admiral.
We're going the wrong way!
We have all conferred with our models,
and the results are in.
The Fours and the Fives
have joined us Ones,
and they voted
to reconfigure the Raiders.
Gee, what a surprise.
Well, the Twos, Sixes and Eights
voted against it, so we're deadlocked.
How hopelessly... But you were right.
And I'm machine enough
- to admit that I was wrong.
- What are you talking about?
Something extraordinary
has happened.
Eight.
What's going on?
Boomer.
I'm not going
to sugarcoat this.
I'll just say that this Eight
- has voted to reconfigure.
- What?
Shocked? I was shocked too.
But no one has ever voted
against their model.
No one. Is this true?
We have to be able to defend ourselves.
No, this is unconscionable.
This is wrong. She can't.
- You had something to do with this.
- No, it was her decision totally.
- You cannot allow this.
- There is no law. There's no edict.
There's nothing that forbids it.
It's just...
It's never happened before.
Try and remember you said that
when he boxes your line.
Now, don't be a sore loser.
If you do this, we all lose.
- We think it's for the best.
- The best?
Have you lost your mind?
Our identies are determined
by our models. Each model is unique.
We belong together.
You know this better than anyone.
"Mechanized copies."
- Those are your very words.
- "Something has changed."
Those are your very words.
And I whole heartedly agree.
The Raiders are sentient,
just as we are.
There was a plan.
A divine plan in our design.
- You're butchering them.
- We're reconfiguring them.
You are not God.
No... I'm a mechanic.
The Raiders were designed
to do a specific job.
They stopped doing it. I'm fixing that.
And when the cutting's all done,
they'll go back to being happy warriors.
So let's move on, all right?
I'll pray for you.
I'll pray hard.
All right, you hooch hounds!
Lock it up!
It's time... Shut the frak up!
Pay attention.
We're saying good-bye...
to the best damn jock you...
pink-ass cones will ever hope to see.
Shut up.
Major?
- Let's go!
- Come on!
- I have a drink.
- Let's do this. Come on now.
I'm not thirsty.
To Galactica!
To the men and women of Galactica.
To the Admiral...
... who commands
the men and women of Galactica.
And to our sweethearts,
husbands, and wives.
To our sweethearts!
To absent friends.
Thank you.
That's very sweet.
Excuse me, will you?
Watch your step.
- You say what?
- Excuse me.
You're spying on me, Tory.
I've seen you here.
No. I heard about the miracle.
The child?
Yes.
You mean Laura Roslin
has heard about it.
All right, I have been spying on you.
Well, it's lucky
I was sitting down, isn't it?
I've been watching these people.
The way they look at you.
If you go squealing to the President
that my newfound popularity borders
on the phenomenal,
- then she should be very worried.
- I came here on my own.
And I slept with your boss last night.
Come on, be nice.
- What's it gonna cost you?
- My God.
My giddy-od!
Get a grip, Gaius.
She's not lying. She really could be
a wonderful source of information.
- Why don't you feel her out?
- Feel her what?
- What?
- I'm not talking to you. Actually...
Try and forget me for a moment.
- Ask her what she's doing here.
- I am talking to you.
- Why did you come here?
- Maybe it was a mistake.
Well, I can't stop thinking
about what's happened.
You were found innocent
when everyone hated you. I hated you.
And this healed boy,
the return of Kara Thrace...
I mean, everyone thought she was dead.
- So perhaps there are miracles.
- Perhaps.
Thing is, somehow you seem
to be at the center of them.
Yes, I do, don't I?
I don't understand myself, to be honest.
Just...
Well, it seems that
God has chosen me
to sing his song.
- A song?
- Music. Did you say music?
Yeah, you know, it's funny.
It's a lot like that. It's...
It's like the distant chaos
of an orchestra
tuning up.
And then
somebody waves a magic wand,
and all of those notes
start to slide into place.
A grotesque,
screeching cacophony
becomes a single melody.
I really shouldn't be seen here.
Who the frak are you?!
What, am I supposed to be impressed?
I mean, you're me.
Obviously you're me, so...
Unless you're not me. Huh?
Six?
Is it you, Six...
Like in disguise?
Now, why would she need
to disguise herself from you?
- Well, you've got a very good point.
- Let's talk about Tory.
- Where is she?
- We should talk about Tory,
'cause we both know
where this is heading.
You like her, don't you?
Yeah, well, you know, she's...
She's a sexy lady.
Yeah, yeah.
Hot.
- You slay me. You really do, Gaius.
- Why?
She's more than all these things.
She's special.
And you feel it.
Yeah, fragile.
Yeah, I sense that too.
You're very observant.
Fragile.
Handle with care.
Oh, I'd love to.
You're enjoying that more than usual.
Hair of the dog.
Lee's party.
What do we do now? Put her on trial?
Find Romo Lampkin?
Take a show of hands?
I don't know.
Follow her into an ambush?
- She is driven.
- Yeah.
You gonna keep waltzing,
or are you gonna sit down and talk?
What's going on? Sit.
What if she's telling the truth?
She was supposed to die out there.
She didn't. I can't explain it.
What if she was meant to help us?
And this was a...
A what?
A miracle?
Is that what you want to call this?
Go ahead, say it.
Grab your piece of the golden arrow.
I want to hear
Admiral Atheist say
that a miracle happened.
You shot at her
and you missed at close range.
Doloxan fraks with your aim.
So does doubt.
I pulled the trigger
and I'd do it again.
She put her life in front of a bullet
as if it had no meaning.
You drop an egg, you reach for another.
Maybe convincing you
meant more to her than her own life.
Is that your miracle?
You want to talk about miracles?
The very same day
that a very pale doctor informed me
that I had terminal cancer,
most of humanity was annihilated,
and I survived.
And by some mathematical absurdity,
I became President.
And then
my cancer disappeared
long enough for us
to find a way to Earth.
You can call it whatever you want.
And now I'm dying.
Don't talk that way.
You've gotta face this.
My life is coming to an end soon enough,
and I am not going to apologize
to you for not trusting her.
And I am not...
I am not going to trust
her with the fate of this fleet.
You are so buckled up inside...
You can't take any more loss.
Your son's leaving...
This, me... I know it.
No one's going anywhere.
Okay...
Here's the truth.
This is what's going on.
You want to believe Kara.
You would rather be wrong about her
and face your own demise
than risk losing her again.
You can stay in the room, but
get out of my head.
You're so afraid to live alone.
And you're afraid to die that way.
You're afraid that you may not be
the dying leader you thought you were.
Or that your death may be as
meaningless
as everyone else's.
Zarek nominated me
for the vacant quorum spot, so I...
You're Zarek's wing man.
All right,
all right, you know, stow it, okay.
I've heard it all before.
The guy's a piece of work, I know.
His head's as big as
the house I grew up in but...
I'm... I'm pretty new to all this.
I could use the help.
Besides, I never really
could say no to anything.
Except me.
Especially you.
You know, I think I finally understand
what you meant about
having a destiny.
I've got to do this.
And the fact that I don't
have an explanation why doesn't...
Doesn't really seem to matter anymore.
So say we all.
So say we all.
Good luck on your journey, Lee Adama.
You too, Kara Thrace.
All right.
Lee...
I believe you.
<i>Red and blue sections will go first,
yellow and green will follow.</i>
<i>Starbuck, if you've got a problem,
I don't want to hear it.</i>
<i>My only problem is you didn't preach
that sermon a week ago.</i>
<i>Keep your ears open. Any Cylon contact,
just shut down, bug out.</i>
<i>- Questions.
- When will you play to the card game?</i>
<i>- We're on tomorrow night!
- All right, all right.</i>
<i>Good luck.
And be careful out there.</i>
Attention to orders!
In recognition of honorable,
loyal, and faithful service,
Madam President,
Admiral of the Colonial Fleet,
ladies and gentlemen...
Major Lee Adama...
Salute!
Good luck.
Thank you.
Well, it looks like you got the house.
I'll miss you.
Good-bye, Lee.
Look after yourself.
We want you
to stop lobotomizing the Raiders, Cavil.
Raiders with free will?
Not going to happen.
Do you know
what just really rankles my ass?!
You've been pointing fingers,
falsely accusing me
of manipulation just short of tyranny.
When you're the one
that's been leading the charge here.
We want you to stop.
You're not in charge.
We had a vote.
For the last time,
will you stop lobotomizing the Raiders?
It's unbelievable, isn't it?
Unbelievable.
For the last time,
no.
I was afraid you'd say that.
Come in.
What is this about?
Centurions can't vote, Six.
They're not here to vote, Cavil.
- Am I hurting you?
- No.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
What do you mean, nothing?
You're crying.
It's just something I do during sex.
- All the time?
- Yeah.
I'm really sorry.
Don't be sorry.
Why should you apologize?
You should be thankful.
You have an abundance of feeling.
I've never
really thought of it like that.
You're blessed, aren't you?
I don't know.
I guess.
I suppose I couldn't be a Cylon.
Well, I don't know about that.
Human beings don't exclusively
hold the patent on suffering.
Cylons can feel.
- You believe that?
- Yeah, I do, actually.
I've spent time amongst them.
Man may have made them,
but God's at the beginning
of the string, isn't he?
It's God who made the real soul.
The one true God.
One God?
The one true God.
You know, I'm becoming
increasingly tired of holding that in.
Of denying that essential truth.
Now, this... This isn't funny.
Leave.
I said leave!
Why don't they leave?
The telencephalic inhibitor
that restricts higher functions
in the Centurions...
- We had them removed.
- Say what?!
You dumbed down the Raiders.
We the Leobens, the Sharons,
gave the Centurions the gift of reason.
You have no authority to do this, none.
You can't do anything without a vote!
No, we can't do anything with one,
so we're finished voting.
What have you done?
First thing they learned is
what you were doing to the Raiders.
You can imagine how they felt.
Oh, no.
Sir, the fleet is prepped
and ready for jump.
Execute jump.
Go back!
Go back...
Open cell.
Cuff her.
So...
You quietly cut me loose in deep space.
I'm not afraid to die.
Little easier
after you've been through it once.
Harder.
Especially now
that I'm seeing things so clearly.
You're making a mistake.
Maybe I am.
But I can't take the chance
that you're right
and not do something about it.
Helo hand-picked a crew for you.
I'm giving you a ship.
I hope you can stand the smell.
We liberated the Demetrius.
It's a sewage recycling ship.
The party line will be
that we're going for a scouting mission.
Looking for food.
So you think I'm right.
Maybe, maybe not.
But I know she is, the President.
She's been right all along.
I'm tired of losing.
I'm tired of turning away from
the things that I want to believe in.
And I believe you when you say
that you'll die before you stop trying.
And I won't lose you again.
Now go.
Find a way to Earth.

DOUZE MODÈLES CYLONS
SEPT SONT CONNUS
QUATRE VIVENT EN SECRET
LE DERNIER SERA RÉVÉLÉ
<i>Précédemment dans</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
On est des Cylons.
Et on l'a toujours été.
L'heure du changement a sonné.
Le gouvernement m'a contacté.
Je pense que ma contribution
leur serait profitable.
Je te donne un vaisseau.
Trouve la route de la Terre.
Il y a cinq autres Cylons, mon frère.
- Je les ai vus.
- Oui, nous le savons.
C'est pourquoi nous avons décidé
d'archiver toute ta lignée.
L'inhibiteur télencéphalique
qui restreint les fonctions évoluées
des Centurions ?
- On l'a fait enlever.
- Quoi ?
Bienvenue, mon frère.
- Que s'est-il passé ?
- On t'a tiré dessus, mais tout va bien.
Qui m'a tiré dessus ?
Nos propres Centurions.
C'est de la folie pure.
Les Six ont perdu la raison.
Elles ignorent l'étendue de la menace
qu'elles ont libérée.
Je dois regagner mon vaisseau.
Ce n'est plus le tien.
Les Six et leurs acolytes
ont engagé leurs nouveaux toutous
dans une petite purification ethnique.
La flotte est divisée en deux.
Tant pis pour mon vote.
Ça m'apprendra
à croire en la démocratie.
Ils peuvent pas avoir besoin de toi
chaque heure de chaque jour !
Tu peux pas te faire remplacer ?
Par qui, Cally ?
Qui va me remplacer ?
Je sais pas ! N'importe qui
sait se servir d'une clé à molette...
Je suis le chef de ce putain de...
J'en ai marre.
Oui !
Dualla, c'est encore moi.
Non, je sais, je suis désolée.
Écoute...
Tu veux bien vérifier ?
Je savais qui j'étais, avant.
Galen Tyrol.
Chef de pont, mari,
père.
Maintenant,
quand je me regarde dans un miroir,
- je sais pas ce que je suis.
- Ça va, avec Cally ?
Tu sais, j'ai jamais
trop aimé l'ambroisie.
Mais maintenant...
C'est comme si j'étais submergée
de sensations et de sentiments nouveaux.
Peut-être que toi aussi.
Quelque part, ça ne me déplaît pas.
Se sentir renaître.
Ouverte à tout.
Au changement.
J'aime pas trop le changement.
Galen, sale fils de...
Cally, viens par là.
Laissez-la respirer.
- Lâche-moi !
- Écoute-moi une seconde.
Cally, écoute-moi.

La nausée devrait se dissiper
d'ici une heure.
<i>Amour et Coups de feu</i>, par Nick Talo.
Chapitre un.
"Ça commence toujours
de la même manière.
"Avec un cadavre.
"Celui-ci était dans la rivière.
"On pouvait voir
qu'elle avait été magnifique.
"Mais sa beauté lui avait été enlevée
par une balle et un fort courant.
"Tout ce que nous sommes,
tout ce que nous croyons être,
"toutes nos certitudes
nous sont enlevées.
"Quand on a bossé dans la rue,
et vu ce que j'ai vu,
"cette certitude
s'impose un peu plus chaque jour.
"Caprica City a été mon mentor,
mon amante.
"Dès que j'ouvre les yeux,
"elle coule dans mes veines
comme du mauvais vin...
"douce-amère, teintée de regrets.
"Je ne lui échapperai jamais,
"non pas que je le souhaite.
"Car elle est ce que je suis.
"Le présent...
"devrait être éternel."
Je suis reconnaissant
et constamment inspiré
par l'autorité ferme et chaleureuse
de la Présidente Roslin,
par la sagesse de mon père,
que certains d'entre vous connaissent,
et par le soutien et les conseils
de mes précieux amis.
Dont certains,
au risque de vous choquer,
ne sont pas Capricans.
C'est donc un honneur
d'accepter ma nomination
au sein du Quorum,
dans l'espoir de poursuivre
le courageux travail du délégué Cowan,
au nom du peuple de Caprica
et de la Flotte.
Merci.
Madame la Présidente, vous avez entériné
la nomination de M. Adama.
Vous n'avez donc aucun ressentiment
concernant son rôle
dans le procès de Baltar ?
Merci beaucoup.
M. Adama a pris part à une cause
qui lui tenait à coeur.
Et je lui fais confiance pour apporter
autant de passion et de clairvoyance
dans la représentation des électeurs.
- Oui ?
- Et le Demetrius ?
Le vaisseau de recyclage d'eaux usées
qui est parti il y a trois semaines.
Je demanderai à l'Amiral Adama
de répondre à cette question.
Le Demetrius est en opération militaire.
Selon la rumeur, Kara Thrace
dirigerait l'opération. Qu'en est-il ?
Je ne commente pas les rumeurs.
Je vais devoir abréger.
Je vous reverrai lors de la conférence
du Quorum. Merci beaucoup.
Ça me surprend
qu'il leur ait fallu si longtemps
pour nous attaquer sur le Demetrius.
- Ça se calmera, avec un peu de chance.
- Ça ne se calmera pas.
Je vais devoir te couvrir
longtemps pour ça.
Je voulais laisser une chance à Kara.
Je voulais me laisser une chance
de croire en elle.
Apparemment...
DEMETRIUS
MISSION : TROUVER LA TERRE
22E JOUR
Vous vouliez me voir, Madame ?
J'ai pris une décision.
Azimuts et reconnaissance.
Quelqu'un pour me rappeler
ce qu'on doit chercher ?
T'as pas eu le mémo du Commandant ?
C'est un amas astronomique unique.
Un système avec une étoile triple,
une géante gazeuse annelée, une comète.
Amas astronomique.
Plutôt une connerie astronomique, oui.
Arrêtez ça.
Désolé, Monsieur, mais admettez
qu'on a l'air de tourner en rond.
Du neuf, Felix ?
Demi-tour, retour au secteur 7.
C'est la dixième correction de cap.
Elle a dit pourquoi cette fois ?
Pourquoi ? Disons plutôt
qu'elle navigue avec ses tripes.
Putain.
Je vous le dis, les gars,
ce truc est un coup monté.
Tu crois que le Patron lui a donné
un vaisseau et l'a lâchée comme ça ?
Sûr que le Galactica nous surveille,
et qu'il sautera
dès qu'elle aura révélé sa vraie nature.
Tu sais pas ce que tu dis.
- Et tu vas me le dire, le bleu ?
- Ouais.
Fermez-la ! Vous tous !
Helo, faut que je te parle.
Tout de suite !
Qui veut parier
sur une correction de cap ?
Kara, écoute.
Certains se posent des questions
sur cette étoile triple
qu'on est censés chercher.
Tu peux en dire plus ?
Une nouvelle info ? N'importe quoi ?
Vous savez tout
ce que vous devez savoir, Enseigne.
Alors, gardez vos questions
et faites votre boulot.
Oui, Madame.
- Qu'y a-t-il, Capitaine ?
- J'ai de nouvelles coordonnées.
Revérifiez les données et le FTL.
Compris ?
Cally, je l'ai dit hier soir...
et je te le redis maintenant.
Je ne te trompe pas.
Je suis sorti prendre un verre.
J'ai croisé Tory, on a discuté.
Je sais de quoi ça a l'air,
mais c'est totalement innocent.
Il n'y a rien entre nous.
Tu vas déposer Nicky.
J'ai rendez-vous chez le docteur.
Tu peux leur dire
de pas lui donner de purée d'algues ?
Je crois qu'il y est allergique.
N'oublie pas, pour les algues.
Je suis désolé. Papa est désolé.
Allez, viens ici. Papa est désolé.
Je vois que vous finissez de nettoyer
votre bazar.
Je ne pense pas
qu'on puisse appeler ça <i>notre</i> bazar.
Ça expliquerait pourquoi
aucune de vous n'est en train d'aider.
Vraiment, Six,
si tu voulais
de la place pour t'installer,
il suffisait de demander.
Tout est vraiment
matière à plaisanterie pour toi ?
Ou est-ce ainsi
que tu perçois notre existence ?
Une espèce de farce nihiliste ?
Une farce nihiliste ? J'aime bien, ça.
Mais honnêtement,
je me sens très sérieux.
Me faire cribler de balles
a cet effet-là sur moi.
Mais je veux que vous sachiez tous
que je me considère
comme unique responsable de tout ça.
Continue.
Vous aviez des inquiétudes légitimes,
et j'ai refusé de les entendre.
Mais là, j'écoute.
Alors dites-moi, que doit-on faire
pour arrêter ça et se réunifier ?
Eh bien, pour commencer,
arrêtez de lobotomiser les Raiders.
- Accepté.
- Et acceptez de réactiver les D'Anna.
De ressusciter toute la lignée ?
N'oublie pas, Six,
c'est la quête messianique de D'Anna,
pour des secrets qu'il faudrait ignorer,
qui nous a menés
sur le chemin de la dissension.
Tu parles de restaurer notre unité.
Nous pensons qu'il est temps
de restaurer notre unité suprême.
De réunir les 12 modèles,
une fois pour toutes.
Je ne pense pas
que les autres vont accepter ça, mais...
je plaiderai ta cause.
Escortez-le vers la sortie.
S'il vous plaît.
C'est bien que tu te souviennes
du mot magique.
La boîte de Pandore que tu as ouverte
est plus grande que tu ne crois.
Stimulant, non ?
Un gouvernement par le peuple,
pour le peuple,
et responsable devant le peuple.
Tout du moins, c'est l'idée.
- Il paraît que vous vouliez la voir.
- Je voulais parler de certains projets,
ceux de la déléguée Cowan,
avant sa mort.
- On m'a dit qu'elle n'était pas là.
- Si,
mais pas pour vous.
En défendant Baltar,
vous avez franchi les limites avec elle.
Et Laura Roslin n'est pas du genre
à pardonner et à oublier.
Elle vous a pardonné.
Vous êtes vice-président.
Pour me laisser sur la touche.
Elle essaiera de faire pareil avec vous.
Bien, alors...
Je suis intrigué.
Pourquoi m'avoir nommé ?
Vous vous êtes battu pour Baltar.
Et pour ça,
vous avez mis Roslin sur la sellette,
sans peur de poser
des questions délicates
et d'exiger des réponses honnêtes.
Si vous attendez que je recommence,
vous n'avez pas de chance.
Je n'ai pas accepté ce poste
pour vous aider à couler la présidente.
Je ne vous le demande pas.
Croyez-le ou non,
je soutiens Laura.
OK, alors quel est le problème ?
C'est surprenant, ce qu'on découvre
quand on est sur la touche,
la façon dont chaque décision prise
par Laura et votre père
est classée "confidentiel".
Ou ses directives
qui ressemblent à des décrets,
et qui entrent en vigueur
sans véritable débat.
Vous savez, elle interdit même
que ses réunions soient enregistrées.
Le secret et le contrôle
commencent à l'obséder.
Le Demetrius n'est que
la partie émergée de l'iceberg.
Parfois,
tout ce qu'il faut,
c'est un tyran bienveillant.
Non.
Un tyran veut le pouvoir pour lui seul.
Et tout ce que Laura veut,
c'est de nous sauver tous.
Croyez-moi.
Mieux encore, croyez en vous.
C'est là-dessus que je compte :
vous n'êtes pas le genre d'homme
à ignorer la vérité...
quand elle est devant vous.
Et si vous me donniez un sédatif,
et que je dormais ici ?
Bien sûr.
On va transformer mon infirmerie
en fumerie pour que vous dormiez un peu.
J'ai l'impression
de ne pas avoir dormi depuis...
qu'on a atteint
cette putain de nébuleuse.
Comment ça se passe, à la maison ?
Mis à part le fait de surprendre
mon mari avec une autre femme
et l'entendre dire
que j'imagine des choses ?
Il ne sait pas ce qu'il rate.
Il devrait se faire examiner la tête.
D'ailleurs,
pourquoi pas me l'amener ?
Je jetterai un oeil.
C'est ce que j'aime chez vous, Doc.
Vous faites semblant d'être un con.
Vu que vous aimez vous faire du mal,
vous vous faites peut-être des idées.
Vous savez,
la fatigue et les antidépresseurs
peuvent créer une sacrée paranoïa.
J'ai pensé que je devais prendre
quelque chose pour pas devenir dingue.
- Vous n'êtes pas dingue.
- Comment appelleriez-vous quelqu'un
qui demande presque en mariage
l'homme qui lui a cassé la mâchoire ?
C'est la dernière fois
qu'il a vous a frappée ?
Vous voulez entendre
un truc vraiment tordu ?
Parfois, je voudrais qu'il le fasse.
Qu'il me frappe.
Au moins, je saurais
qu'il éprouve quelque chose.
Écoutez, dormez un peu
pour vous éclaircir les idées.
J'y vais, Doc.
Merci.
Kara, qu'est-ce qui va pas chez toi ?
Tu te caches,
alors les gens se posent des questions.
Laisse-les.
Franchement, ils commencent à m'emmerder
autant que je les emmerde.
Je m'en fous !
Tu sais, certains d'entre nous
se sont portés volontaires.
Certains, c'est-à-dire toi ?
C'est de ça qu'il s'agit, Sam ?
Tu veux savoir où on en est ?
Où en est notre mariage ?
Il n'avait aucun sens au départ.
C'est encore pire maintenant.
Donne-moi ça.
J'y crois pas.
Tu penses pas
un seul mot de ce que tu dis.
Tu as peur.
Tu vois ça ?
Et ça ? Tu t'en souviens ?
Tu te rappelles quand on les a eus ?
C'est réel, ça fait partie de nous.
Ça fait partie de toi,
que tu l'admettes ou non.
Espèce de pauvre con.
Si je t'ai épousé, Sam,
c'est que c'était sans danger et facile.
Et tu as été assez pathétique
pour y croire.
Alors, barre-toi.
J'ai dit dehors.
Sors de là !
Je veux pas me battre, Sam.
Je veux baiser.
Tu piges pas, hein ?
Je suis plus la fille
que tu as épousée.
Tout ce que je veux, c'est baiser.
Baiser, comme à la fin du monde,
et que rien d'autre n'a d'importance.
Alors, viens, Sam.
Fais-moi ressentir quelque chose.
Si tu l'oses.
On était mariés, n'est-ce pas ?
Je veux dire, c'était pas un délire.
Carrément pas.
Les cicatrices sont là pour le prouver.
Ça te paraît pas différent ?
- Différent en quoi ?
- Je sais pas.
Comme si tout était si loin.
La façon dont je sens les choses.
Leur saveur.
Comme si je me regardais,
mais sans ressentir, sans...
... le vivre.
Comme si mon corps
était une chose étrangère
à laquelle je reste attachée.
Ça te paraît insensé ?
Sincèrement,
nous étions aussi surpris que vous.
Nous avons exposé votre cas,
en avons débattu.
Et nous étions en minorité.
Nos compatriotes semblent penser
que c'était une erreur
d'archiver les D'Anna.
Votre opinion
n'a pas l'air d'avoir changé.
J'ai promis d'y réfléchir sérieusement.
Mais nous avons fini par conclure
que nos choix étaient justes.
Malheureusement, les autres
ne pensaient qu'à restaurer l'unité.
C'est difficile de maintenir l'unité
quand vous rejetez nos croyances.
Écoutez, il a tenu parole.
Vous avez gagné. Vous pensez avoir
le droit de prendre nos âmes aussi ?
Non, vous êtes présomptueuses.
- Ne nous comparez pas à...
- Ils ont raison.
Ils ont accepté nos conditions.
Il n'y a plus lieu de s'affronter.
Sinon, nous risquons
d'être à court de corps de rechange.
Le noyau de conscience des Trois
est en train d'être restauré.
Le serveur le plus proche
est à une demi-douzaine de sauts d'ici.
Nous pouvons y aller ensemble
pour entendre votre nouveau héros.
Si ça ne vous ennuie pas,
nous préférons
rester sur nos propres vaisseaux.
Je vous en prie.
Je doute que nous soyons à l'aise, ici,
de toute façon.
Le conseil donne la parole
au délégué de Sagittaron.
La Présidente pourrait-elle commenter
les informations provenant
de sources soi-disant militaires
selon lesquelles le Demetrius cherche
de nouvelles sources de nourriture ?
Ou, Madame la Présidente,
préféreriez-vous que nous acceptions
cette grossière tentative
de désinformation ?
Silence, s'il vous plaît.
Je crains de ne pas contrôler les médias
autant que je le souhaiterais.
Concernant les rapports,
la mission du Demetrius
relève de la sécurité de la flotte
et je ne peux donc rien en révéler.
Ma circonscription n'est pas satisfaite
des décisions...
Comprenez-vous que cela jette un doute
sur une chose aussi cruciale
que notre itinéraire vers la Terre ?
Oui. Mais mon "oui" ne signifie pas
que les rumeurs sont vraies.
- Madame la Présidente !
- Jacob, Aaron, s'il vous plaît.
Je ne peux pas croire que le Demetrius
soit le seul souci
de votre circonscription.
Pouvons-nous avancer,
maintenant que vous avez ma réponse ?
- Vous pouvez dire adieu à notre marché.
- Allez vous faire foutre.
S'il vous plaît.
Silence !
Madame la Présidente,
nous comprenons tous
les nécessités en matière de sécurité.
Mon expérience militaire m'a appris
que nous péchons souvent
par excès de prudence.
Alors, afin de rassurer mes collègues
et dans l'espoir de clore ce débat,
ne serait-il pas juste de dire
que vous et l'Amiral Adama
examinez toutes les possibilités
d'itinéraires vers la Terre ?
Enfin, nous y voilà. C'est exactement
ce dont nous avons besoin.
M. Adama, nous tenons tous beaucoup
à profiter de votre expérience.
Néanmoins,
je ne souhaite pas, personnellement,
qu'un jeune délégué
s'autoproclame mon porte-parole.
Poursuivons. Jacob,
vous vouliez évoquer quelque chose.
Pourriez-vous poursuivre ?
Merci, Madame la Présidente.
Mes électeurs
- n'arrivent de nouveau pas à obtenir...
- Point de procédure.
J'ai préparé un rapport
dont nous devrions...
- Je soulève un point de procédure.
- Excusez-moi. S'il vous plaît !
Silence !
Silence, s'il vous plaît !
Merci beaucoup.
- M. Cantrell, cédez-vous la parole ?
- Certainement.
Merci.
Cela concerne votre décret 112...
112.
... qui met en place
un système de tribunaux
dont vous choisissez les juges
et qui n'ont de comptes à rendre
qu'à une cour d'appel spéciale,
dont vous nommez également les juges.
Concrètement,
cela crée un système judiciaire
qui concentre dangereusement le pouvoir
entre les mains de l'exécutif.
À savoir, entre vos mains,
Madame la Présidente.
Loin d'être indépendant ou impartial,
cela porterait atteinte
aux fondements mêmes de la justice.
- Même à une parodie de justice.
- Merci, M. Adama.
Le décret que vous dénoncez,
le décret 112,
est encore à l'état de projet
et les modifications qu'il propose
sont provisoires.
C'est la première étape,
une petite étape, mais la première
d'un projet plus important,
visant à créer un système judiciaire
équitable et complet
dont vous, plus que tout autre,
devez comprendre la nécessité.
J'allais bien sûr le soumettre
au Quorum pour débat, une fois fini,
ce qui n'est pas le cas.
Mais, comme vous l'avez rendu public
aujourd'hui,
je propose que ce soit ajouté
au programme de la prochaine session.
Cela vous convient-il, M. Adama ?
Le vaisseau de résurrection
n'a pas sauté.
- Un problème avec leur FTL ?
- RAS.
Les vaisseaux-mères de Cavil rompent
la formation, et nous encerclent.
Ils vont attaquer.
Préviens les autres !
On doit sauter immédiatement.
- Ils ont endommagé notre FTL !
- Pas de vaisseau de résurrection.
Ils veulent nous éliminer.
Souviens-toi...
C'est eux qui ont commencé.
Mais on les tue.
On les tue pour de bon.
Mes propres soeurs.
Leur Dieu veillera sûrement
sur leur âme immortelle.
Et pour la nôtre ?
Nous sommes des machines,
tu te souviens ?
Nous n'avons pas d'âme.
ARMURERIE 170ID
13H30
<i>J'aurai tout entendu.</i>
<i>- ... Cylon nymphomane.
- Ne vous en faites pas, Colonel,</i>
<i>- vous n'êtes pas mon genre.
- Encore une chose.</i>
Désormais, on se verra qu'en privé.
Après votre show chez Joe l'autre soir,
on a suffisamment attiré l'attention.
- Génial. C'est bon, on peut y aller ?
- Pourquoi t'es si pressé ?
Je dois voir Cally.
Tu l'as pas vue en prenant mon mot ?
Quel mot ?
Celui que j'ai planqué dans
tes quartiers pour qu'on se voie ici.
Tory m'a prévenu.
Vous avez... Putain...
- Si Cally trouve le mot...
- Vaudrait mieux pas.
T'as intérêt à régler
cette histoire de coucherie.
Faut tout faire
pour qu'elle arrête de fouiner.
On a vraiment pas besoin que ta femme
apprenne qu'une bande de synthétiques
se balade sur ce vaisseau
et que son mari est l'un d'entre eux.
J'en ai marre de voir
vos gueules de victimes.
Putain !
Comment tu vas ?
Bien.
Tu te sens bien ?
Oui, ça va.
T'es sûre ?
Oui, je vais bien.
Je croyais couver quelque chose,
donc j'ai dormi.
- T'es allée voir Cottle ?
- Non, ça va mieux.
Bien.
Ces dernières semaines
ont pas été faciles.
Je sais ce que tu crois.
Ce n'est pas vrai.
C'est pas vrai ?
Non.
Je ne te trompe pas.
J'ai compris ce qui est important.
Tu es importante.
Nicky est important.
Nous, c'est important.
C'est de ça qu'il s'agit, n'est-ce pas ?
De famille, de futur.
De construire ce futur ensemble.
Je te promets que maintenant
je serai là pour nous.
Pour nous trois.
Pour nous quatre, qui sait ?
Peut-être qu'un jour,
on fera un autre bébé.
Qu'est-ce que t'en dis ?
Un autre bébé ?
Un frère ou une soeur pour Nick ?
Ça te plairait, un frère ou une soeur ?
Cally !
M'approchez pas !
Je sais ce que vous êtes !
Vous et les autres.
Vraiment ?
On ignore nous-mêmes ce qu'on est.
Je vous ai vus. Vous êtes des Cylons !
- Un ramassis de synthétiques.
- J'aimerais que ce soit aussi simple.
Je vous ai dit de pas approcher.
J'espère pour vous
qu'un corps de rechange vous attend.
Vous voulez me tuer ?
Allez-y.
Ne faites pas ça.
Ni à vous, ni à votre fils.
- À Nicky...
- Dégagez !
Vous mettrez pas la main sur mon fils !
Ni vous, ni Galen !
- Il s'est servi de moi, putain !
- Il ne savait pas.
On l'ignorait tous.
On l'a su en entrant dans la nébuleuse.
Ferme-la, bombe à retardement !
Tout ce qu'on sait,
c'est qu'on est des Cylons.
Mais pour tout le reste,
- on reste les mêmes personnes.
- Vous êtes des putains de machines !
Je ne sais pas.
Mais nous ne sommes pas mauvais.
Nous ne sommes pas inhumains.
On est tout aussi
effrayés et déboussolés que vous.
Je peux pas vivre comme ça !
C'est un putain de cauchemar.
Vous ne pouvez pas faire ça, Cally.
C'est votre fils.
Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?
Je m'en veux tellement.
Ça va...
Ça va aller.
On va sortir d'ici.
Ça va.
On va s'en sortir ensemble.
Ça va.
D'accord.
Laissez-moi le prendre.

<i>Previously on</i> Battlestar Galactica...
We're Cylons.
And we have been from the start.
It's time for a change.
I've had some feelers
from the government.
I think I could make a valuable
contribution there.
I'm giving you a ship.
Now go find a way to Earth.
There are five other Cylons, brother.
I saw them.
Yes, we know.
That's why we've decided
to box your entire line.
The telencephalic inhibitor
that restricts higher functions
in the Centurions?
- We had them removed.
- Say what?!
Welcome back, brother.
- What happened?
- You were shot, but you're with us now.
Shot by who?
By our own Centurions.
That's pure insanity.
The Sixes have lost their minds.
They have no idea of the threat
that they've unleashed.
I need to get to my ship.
It's not your ship anymore.
The Sixes and their acolytes
used their new pets
to engage in a little ethnic cleansing.
The fleet's split right down the middle.
So much for my swing vote.
That'll teach me
not to trust in democracy.
They can't possibly need you
every single hour, every single day.
Can't you just tell someone
to fill in for you?
Who, Cally?
Who's gonna fill in for me?
I don't know! Anyone can frakkin' turn
a wrench down there. There's not...
I'm the chief of the frak...
I've had enough of this.
Yes!
Dualla, it's me again.
No, I know, I'm sorry.
Can you please just check?
<i>I used to know who I was.</i>
Galen Tyrol.
Crew chief, husband,
father.
I look in the mirror nowadays,
I don't even know what I am.
Are you and Cally getting along?
You know,
I never really liked ambrosia before.
But now...
It's like I'm being flooded
with new sensations and new feelings.
Maybe you are too.
In some ways, I don't hate this.
Feeling new.
Feeling open to things.
To change.
I don't do well with change.
Galen, you son of a...
Cally, come here.
Just give her some room.
- Let go of me! Let go!
- Just listen to me for a second.
Cally, listen to me.

The nausea should go away
in about an hour.
<i>Love and Bullets</i>, by Nick Talo.
Chapter one.
"It started like it always did.
"With a body.
"This one was in the river.
"I could tell
she had once been beautiful.
"But this a bullet and fast current
had taken away from her.
"All we are,
all that we think we are,
"all that we are certain about
is taken away from us.
"When you've worked the streets
and seen what I've seen,
"you become more and more
convinced of it every day.
"Caprica City had been my teacher,
my mistress.
"From the moment I open my eyes,
"she's in my blood, like cheap wine...
"bitter and sweet,
"tinged with regret.
"I'll never be free of her,
"nor do I want to be.
"For she is what I am.
"All that is...
"should always be."
I am grateful
and consistently inspired
by the compassionate
and forthright leadership
of President Roslin.
By the wisdom of my father,
whom some of you may know.
And by the support and advice
of my valued friends.
Some of whom,
you may be shocked to hear,
are not Capricans.
And so I am honored
to accept this appointment
to the Quorum
in the hope that I can continue
Delegate Cowan's courageous work
on behalf of the people of Caprica
and the fleet.
Thank you.
Madam President,
by confirming Mr. Adama's nomination,
does it mean you don't have
any hard feelings
about his role
in the Baltar trial?
Thank you very much.
Mr. Adama took on a cause
he felt was important.
And I fully trust
he will continue to bring
the same passion
and clear-mindedness
in representing his constituents.
- Yes?
- What about the Demetrius?
The sewage recycling freighter
that jumped away three weeks ago.
I will ask Admiral Adama
to answer that question.
The Demetrius is on a military mission.
What about the rumor that Kara Thrace
was put in charge of that mission?
I don't comment on rumors.
I'm gonna have to cut this short.
I will see you all very soon
at the Quorum Q&A. Thank you very much.
Frankly, I'm surprised
it took them this long
to come after us about the Demetrius.
Any luck and it'll blow over.
It's not going to blow over.
I'm gonna be covering
for you for a long time on this.
I wanted to give Kara a chance.
I wanted to give myself
a chance to believe in her.
Apparently.
You wanted to see me, Sir?
I've made a decision.
Caps and recon runs.
Okay, anyone want to remind me
what we're supposed to be looking for?
Didn't you get the commander's memo?
It's a unique astronomic cluster.
A system with a ringed gas giant,
trinary star, and a comet.
Astronomic cluster.
Sounds more like a cluster frak.
That's enough of that crap.
Sorry, Sir, but you gotta admit
it's starting to feel like
we're flying around in circles.
What's the latest, Felix?
She's reversing course,
returning to sector seven.
That is the tenth course correction.
Did she give a reason this time?
A reason? Let's just say
I think she's steering with her gut.
Frak me.
I'm telling you guys,
this thing is a setup anyway.
You think that the old man just gave her
the ship and then cut her loose?
I guarantee you
Galactica's dogging our every move,
and they're waiting to jump in
as soon as she shows her true colors.
You don't know
what you're talking about.
- You gonna tell me what I know, rook?
- Yeah, maybe.
I said to can it!
All of you!
Helo, I need to talk to you.
Now!
Who wants odds
on a course correction then?
Kara, hey, listen.
Some of us have been wondering
about this trinary star formation
we're supposed to be looking for.
Is there anything
else you can tell us about it?
Any new data? Anything at all?
You know everything
you need to know, ensign.
So stow the questions and do your job.
Yes, Sir.
- What's up, Captain?
- Helo, I have new jump coordinates.
Double check
the data file and the FTL drive.
Got it?
Cally, I told you last night
and I'm telling you again right now.
I am not having an affair.
I went out for a drink.
I ran into Tory. We started talking.
Look, I know how it looks,
but it's completely innocent.
There's nothing to it.
You'll have to drop Nicky off.
I have a doctor's appointment.
Can you tell them
not to feed him any of that algae mash?
I think he's allergic.
Just remember about the algae.
No, I'm sorry. Daddy's sorry.
Hey, come here. I'm sorry.
I see you're still
cleaning up your mess.
Oh, I hardly think
this qualifies as our mess.
Well, I guess that explains why none
of you are lending a helping hand.
Really, Six,
if you had wanted
some room to spread out,
you could've just asked.
Is there anything
that isn't fodder for a joke with you?
Or is that really
how you see our very existence?
As some sort of nihilistic punch line?
Nihilistic punch line? I like that.
But quite honestly, I'm feeling...
very serious.
Getting riddled
with bullets affects me that way.
But I want you all to know
that I place the blame
for all of this squarely on myself.
Go on.
Well, you had legitimate concerns,
but I refused to hear them.
But now I'm listening.
So tell me, what's to be done to stop
all this and let us get back together?
Well,
for starters,
you can stop lobotomizing the Raiders.
Done.
And you can agree to unbox the D'Annas.
Resurrect her entire line?
Don't forget, Six,
it was D'Anna's messianic quest
for secrets better left alone
that started us down
this divisive path in the first place.
You talk about restoring our unity.
Well, we think it's time
to restore our greater unity.
To unite the 12 models
once and for all.
Well, I don't think
the others will accept this, but...
I'll make your case.
Escort him off the ship.
Please.
It's a good thing
you remembered the magic word.
You're going to find you opened
a bigger can of worms than you realize.
Inspiring, isn't it?
A government of the people,
for the people,
and answerable to the people.
At least that's the idea.
- I heard you tried to see her.
- I had some bills I wanted to discuss.
Projects delegate Cowan
was pushing before she died.
- But they told me she wasn't in.
- She was,
just not for you.
By standing up for Baltar,
you crossed the line with her.
And Laura Roslin is not the type
to forgive and forget.
She forgave you.
She made you vice President.
To keep me on the sidelines.
Same way she'll try to sideline you.
Well, then...
I'm intrigued. Why did you...
nominate me in the first place?
Because you did stand up for Baltar.
And you put Roslin
on the stand to do it.
You weren't afraid
to ask some hard questions
and to demand some honest answers.
Well, if you're looking for a repeat
performance, you're out of luck.
I didn't take this job to help you
undermine the President.
I'm not asking you to.
Believe it or not,
I'm on Laura's side.
Okay, then what's the problem?
It's amazing the things you start
to notice when you're on the sidelines,
how every decision
that Laura and your father make
gets stamped "classified".
Or how her directives
are starting to read like decrees,
yet still get enacted
without so much as a debate.
You know, she won't even allow
records to be kept
of any of her meetings.
Secrecy and control
are becoming obsessions for her.
I think this Demetrius business
is just the tip of the iceberg.
Well, sometimes
a benevolent tyrant's
exactly what you need.
No.
A tyrant craves power for its own sake.
And all Laura wants
is to save us all.
Trust me.
Better yet, trust yourself.
Because that's what
I'm really counting on.
That you're not the kind of man
who can ignore the truth...
when it stares you in the face.
What if you gave me a sedative
and I just slept here?
Oh, sure.
We'll just turn my sickbay
in an opium den
so you can have a little snooze.
Feels like I haven't had
a night's sleep since...
we reached that frakkin' nebula.
How are things on the home front?
You mean other than catching my husband
with another woman
and having him tell me
I'm imaging things?
The man doesn't know
what he's got at home.
Should have his head examined.
As a matter of fact,
why don't you bring him in?
I'll take a look.
See, that's what I like about you, Doc.
You just pretend to be a bastard.
While you're in the mood for tough love,
maybe you are imaging things.
You know, fatigue and antidepressants
can make a hell of a paranoia cocktail.
I felt like I need to take something
to keep from going completely crazy.
You're not crazy.
What would you call someone
who all but proposes to a man
after he breaks her jaw?
That the last time he laid hands on you?
You want to hear something really sick?
Sometimes I wish he would.
Lay hands on me.
At least then I'd... I'd know
he had some feelings about me.
Listen, just get some sleep
and clear your head.
Will do, Doc.
Thank you.
Kara, what the hell's
the matter with you?
'Cause the way you're holing up in here,
you're making people wonder.
Let 'em.
Frankly, they're starting to bug me
as much as I bug them.
Frak 'em.
You know, some of us
actually volunteered for this mission.
Some meaning you?
Is that what this is about, Sam?
You want to know what the deal
is with us? With our marriage?
Well, it didn't make much sense
to begin with. Makes even less now.
Give me that.
I don't buy that.
I don't think you believe
a single frakkin' word you're saying.
You're just scared.
You see that?
You see this? You remember those?
Do you remember when we got 'em?
That's what's real.
That's part of who we are.
That is a part of who you are,
whether you want to admit it or not.
You dumb motherfrakker.
I only married you because it was safe
and it was easy, Sam.
And you were just pathetic
enough to go along with it.
So get the frak out.
I said get out.
Get out!
I don't want to fight, Sam.
I want to frak.
You don't get it, do you?
I'm not the same girl you married.
All I want to do right now is frak.
Really frak, like it's the end
of the world and nothing else matters.
So come on, Sam.
Make me feel something.
I dare you.
We were married,
weren't we?
I mean, that wasn't just like a fantasy.
Hell, no.
And I got the scars to prove it.
Does that seem different to you somehow?
Different how?
Not sure.
It's like everything seems so far away.
The way things feel.
The way they taste.
Like I'm watching myself, but
I'm not really experiencing it, not...
... living it.
Like my body's just this alien thing
that I'm still attached to.
Does that seem crazy to you?
Frankly,
we were as surprised as you are.
We presented your case.
There was some debate.
And we were outvoted.
Our compatriots now seem to agree
that it was wrong to box the D'Annas.
It sounds like your own opinion
hasn't changed.
I promised that we'd do
some hard thinking.
But in the end, we decided
that our choices were correct.
Unfortunately, restoring unity
was all the others seemed to care about.
It's hard to have unity when you're
so opposed to everything we believe in.
Look, he kept his word.
You won the day. Do you think you have
the right to win our hearts and minds?
No, you're being presumptuous.
- Don't compare us to...
- They're right.
If they've agreed to our terms,  there's
no point in courting any more discord.
Any more discord
and we may run out of spare bodies.
The Three's core consciousness
is being downloaded
at our central resurrection hub.
The nearest accessible server
is a half dozen jumps from here.
We can go together and hear
what your newfound heroine has to say.
If you don't mind,
we'd prefer to stay on our own ships.
By all means.
I'd doubt that the rest of us
would feel comfortable here anyway.
The chair recognizes
the delegate from Sagittaron.
Would the President care to comment
on the news stories crediting
so-called military sources
that claim the Demetrius
is searching for new food sources?
Or, Madame President,
would you rather that we just
simply accept
this obvious attempt at disinformation?
Order, please.
I'm afraid I don't control the media,
Jacob, as much as you know I'd love to.
Regarding the reports,
the Demetrius mission
is a matter of fleet security,
and as such
I can't and won't discuss it, period.
Madame President, I have to say
that my constituency is not satisfied...
Do you realize this casts doubt
on something
as fundamental as our route to Earth?
Yes, but don't take my "yes"
to imply that the rumors are true.
- Madame President!
- Jacob, Aaron, everyone, please.
I can not believe that the Demetrius
is the only matter
that is important to your constituents.
Can we please move on?
You know my answer to this.
You can tell your free trade deal
good-bye.
You can kiss my ass.
Order, please.
Order!
Madame President,
I'm sure we can all understand
the importance
for the need for security.
Coming from the military,
it's my experience that we sometimes err
too strongly on the side of caution.
So, for the sake
of reassuring my colleagues
and hopefully
putting this matter to rest,
would it not be fair to say
that you and Admiral Adama
are naturally exploring
all possible routes to Earth?
Hear, hear. Now we're getting focus.
That's exactly what we need.
Mr. Adama, we are all anxious
to receive
the benefit of your experience.
But,
I personally don't feel the need
to have a junior delegate
appoint himself my spokesman.
Let's move on. Jacob,
you had a matter on the table.
Would you please continue?
Thank you, Madame President.
My constituents
- are having problems obtaining...
- Point of order.
Now, I have prepared
a report that I think we...
- Point of order, mister Vice President.
- Excuse me. Hello?
Order, please!
Order, please!
Thank you very, very much. Mr. Cantrell,
- will you yield the floor?
- I will yield.
Thank you.
This relates
to your executive order 112.
112.
Which establishes a system of tribunals.
The judges are chosen by you.
Answerable
only to a special court of appeals,
the judges of which
would also be chosen by you.
Effectively it creates
a justice system that further
and dangerously concentrates power
into the hands of the executive.
Namely, into your hands,
Madame President.
Far from being independent or impartial,
it would actually damage
the very idea of justice. Even
the illusion of the idea of justice.
Thank you, Mr. Adama.
And the order you're referring to,
executive order 112,
is actually a work in progress,
and the changes it proposes
are provisional.
It is a first step,
a tiny step, but the first step
in a... in a larger plan,
actually, to create a fair
and comprehensive legal system,
which you of all people
can admit we sorely need.
Now naturally I was going to bring it
to the Quorum to open it up for debate
once it was finished, which it isn't.
But since you've brought it
into the public today,
I propose that we put it on the dock
for the next full session.
Is that satisfactory to you, Mr. Adama?
The resurrection ship
didn't make the jump.
- Problem with their FTL?
- No report.
Now Cavil's baseships
are breaking formation,
taking positions around our periphery.
They're going to attack.
Alert the others!
We need to jump now.
- They've taken out our FTL!
- No resurrection ship.
They're trying to kill us.
Just remember...
They started it.
But we're killing them.
We're truly killing them.
My own sisters.
They can trust their God
to watch over their immortal souls.
And what about ours?
We're machines, dear, remember?
We don't have souls.
<i>Now I've heard everything.</i>
<i>Anders and Gaius frakkin' Baltar.</i>
<i>- ... Cylon nymphomaniac.
- Don't worry, Colonel.</i>
<i>- You're not my type.
- And one more thing.</i>
From now on we only meet in private
after that scene you two pulled
in Joe's bar the other night,
we can't risk any more attention.
- Fine, great. We done, can we go?
- Why are you so antsy?
I told Cally I'd check on her.
Well, didn't you do that
when you got my note?
What note?
The note I left in the drop
in your quarters about this meeting.
Tory found me. Did you... Frak me.
- If Cally finds the note then...
- You better hope she doesn't.
And you better put an end
to this affair business.
Whatever it takes
to stop her from nosing around.
Last thing we need
is for your Cylon-hating wife
to find out there's a bunch of skinjobs
running around this ship
and that her husband is one of them.
I'm tired of looking
at your sorry faces.
Frak! Frak!
How you doing?
Fine.
You feeling okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Sure?
Yeah, actually, I am.
Thought I was coming down
with something, so I slept in.
- Did you go see Cottle?
- No, I'm feeling better.
Good.
Look, I know it's been
a rough couple of weeks.
I know what you're thinking.
It's not true.
It isn't?
No.
I'm not having an affair.
I figured it out.
I know what's important.
You're important.
Nicky's important.
We're important. Us.
That's really what it's all about,
isn't it? A family, a future.
Building that future together.
I promise you from now on
I will be here for us.
The three of us.
Maybe the four of us.
You know, maybe someday
we'll have another baby.
What do you think? Another baby?
A brother, a sister for little Nick?
Would you like
a little brother or sister?
Cally!
Stay the frak away from me!
I know what you are!
I know what all of you are.
How could you?
We don't even know what we are.
I heard you. You're Cylons!
- A bunch of frakkin'skinjobs.
- I wish it were that simple.
I told you to stay away from me.
I guess you better hope
there's a spare body waiting for you.
You want to kill me?
Go ahead.
Don't do this to yourself
or to your child.
- To Nicky.
- Get the frak away!
You're not getting your hands on my son!
Not you or not Galen!
- He frakkin' used me!
- He didn't know.
None of us did.
We didn't find out
until we entered that nebula.
Just shut the frak up, triggered!
All we know is that we're Cylons.
But in every other way,
- we're still the same people.
- You're frakkin' machines!
I don't know.
But I do know that we're not evil.
We're not inhuman.
And we're just as
scared and confused as you are.
I can't live like this!
It's a frakkin' nightmare.
You don't want to do this, Cally.
He's your son.
What have I done? I'm so sorry.
It's okay...
It's gonna be okay.
Let's just get out of here.
It's okay.
We'll work this out together.
It's okay.
Okay.
Here. Let me take him.

12 MODELES CYLONS
7 SONT CONNUS
4 VIVENT EN SECRET
LE DERNIER SERA REVELE
<i>Précédemment dans Battlestar Galactica.</i>
Vous serez en sécurité ici Gaďus.
Je vous en prie mon Dieu,
ne laissez pas cet enfant mourir.
- Il a répondu ŕ vos pričres. Venez.
- Quoi ?
- Regardez-le.
- Aucune trace de fičvre.
C'est un miracle.
Je suis étonné de vous
trouver ŕ la cafétéria.
Vous ętes submergée de sentiments.
Je pourrais ętre un Cylon.
Les Cylons peuvent ressentir.
- Vous y croyez ?
- Absolument.
Je vais t'expliquer.
Elle nous a trahis.
Vous savez ce qu'il vous reste ŕ faire.
Ce serait mieux pour elle
que vous vous en chargiez.
Disons que Cally le découvre.
Que ferons-nous alors ?
On n'a pas besoin que votre femme
qui déteste les Cylons
découvre que des synthétiques
se baladent en liberté sur le vaisseau.
Et que son mari est l'un d'entre eux.
- Cally !
- Ne vous approchez pas de moi !
Je sais tout. Vous ętes des Cylons.
Une bande de foutus synthétiques.
Je n'ai pas pu
te protéger du mal mon amour,
mais tu resteras dans mon cśur.
Tu étais l'air dans mes poumons,
le sang dans mes veines.
Ma lumičre dans l'obscurité,
et ŕ présent, cet air a disparu.
Ce sang,
et cette lumičre ont disparu.
Il ne me reste,
que ma voix.
Et les seigneurs de Kobol,
aussi nombreux et
différents des mortels qu'ils soient,
doivent se pencher trčs bas,
pour entendre cette voix,
et entendre ma peine.
Avec toutes nos pensées et notre amour,
Calandra Henderson Tyrol,
que ton esprit rejoigne l'Univers.
Ainsi soit-il.
<i>Ainsi soit-il.</i>
J'ai aimé cette cérémonie.
Jamais de ça pour moi,
je vous le demande.
Je sais, mais je voulais
que vous sachiez ce que j'aime.
C'était trčs beau.
Merci.
Pourquoi font-ils toujours
ce genre de choses ŕ l'aube ?
C'est comme ça.
Ils le font car ils le doivent.
Je suis désolée.
Dites-moi si vous avez besoin
de quoi que ce soit.
Merci.
Mes condoléances.
Désolée Chef.
C'était quoi ça ?
Il veut nous faire tuer.
Chef.
Je suis vraiment désolé.
Quoi de neuf aujourd'hui ?
La routine : ça dort, ça marche...
Je ne sais pas comment
ça fait pour ne pas devenir cinglé.
Son cerveau est probablement éteint.
Foutue machine.
Ouais...
Colonel.
Votre demande de voir l'enfant,
Hera Agathon, a été rejetée.
Et vous avez ressenti le besoin de
descendre jusqu'ici pour me le dire ?
Vous pensez que je voulais venir ici ?
On a fini.
Je ne pense pas.
Vous venez tous les jours,
<i>mais vous ne me posez
jamais de questions.</i>
Attendez-vous quelque chose de moi ?
Avez-vous besoin de quelque chose ?
Reculez.
Ŕ demain Colonel.
La porte !
C'était quoi ce truc
ŕ la cérémonie ce matin ?
Autant faire une annonce ŕ la radio
et dire ŕ la flotte qui nous sommes.
Vous allez vous en sortir
avec cet enfant ?
Il a sans doute besoin d'ętre changé.
Trčs bien.
Vous croyez que Cally
s'est suicidée ŕ cause de vous ?
Elle pensait
que nous avions une liaison.
Mais ce n'était pas le cas.
Je ne sais męme plus qui je suis.
Je ne sais pas
lesquels de mes souvenirs sont réels.
Je ne sais pas s'il y a une action
dans ma vie qui n'a pas été programmée.
Galen,
vous ętes parfait.
Vous n'avez pas besoin de culpabilité.
Nous sommes créés pour ętre parfaits.
C'est quoi ça ?
Encore des conneries de Baltar ?
Donc...
Vous arrivez ŕ vivre sans culpabilité ?
Je...
Je la supprime.
Non, ce n'était pas le marché.
Colonel, vous l'avez dit vous-męme.
"Soyez celui que vous voulez ętre
jusqu'ŕ votre mort."
Sommes-nous toujours les męmes ?
Bien sűr que oui. Vous, fermez-la.
Nous ne sommes pas comme les humains.
Nous sommes plus forts, exact ?
Chef...
Ce que vous ressentez, c'est ce qu'un
homme ressent dans ces circonstances.
C'est normal, et c'est humain.
Et ça ne va pas changer de si tôt.
Ce sera comme ça tous les jours.
Vous la verrez chaque jour.
Vous la verrez.
Soyez un homme Chef.
Ressentez ce que vous devez ressentir,

Au nom des Dieux, quoi ?
Des ?
Je pensais qu'il n'y en avait qu'un.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Je t'arrache les cheveux
de la tęte un par un.
C'est intense, n'est-ce pas ?
Oui.
On le ressent en męme temps
comme un contact agréable.
Aďe !
Les sensations sont mélangées,
pas vrai ?
Oui.
C'est dur de trouver le
plaisir dans la douleur.
Oui.
Ok, écoute, je pense que...
Tu as de la force.
Vraiment.
Je préférais quand tu pleurais.
Si tu supposes que Dieu te pardonne,
alors c'est bon, n'est-ce pas ?
Oublié.
Pardonné.
Tu dois te repentir de ton pęché.
- Le rendre bénin.
- Oh oui.
- Le mal devient bien.
- Oh oui.
La douleur devient plaisir.
Et cela ne veut-il pas dire
que si tu ne fais qu'un avec Dieu,
tu ne peux pas faire le mal ?
Non, pas vraiment, parce que...
ça voudrait dire que nous
sommes parfaits.
- Parfaits ?
- Oui.
- Parfaits comme nous sommes.
- Non, non, non ! Non !
Allez, sortez de lŕ !
Oů est Gaďus Baltar ?
Il n'est pas lŕ.
Toi, debout.
Trouve-le.
- Oů est-il ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Alerte de sécurité.
Baie 8, section 14.
Une minute ! Allez !
Nous reviendrons pour Gaďus Baltar.
Chier !
Vous vous en sortez, Chef ?
Ouais, donnez-moi encore un instant.
Je pense que c'est un garçon.
Voilŕ, Chef.
Pratique d'ętre petit hein ?
Chef, c'est bon ?
Je dois y aller.
Ouais.
Allez-y.
Raptor de sortie. Relevés courants.
Racetrack, Redwing.
Nous avons attendu aprčs votre bus
scolaire toute la journée.
Bus scolaire, hein ?
Qu'est-ce que ça fait de ces choses ?
Des bicyclettes ?
Des voitures de course, chérie.
Plein de carburant.
Ça ne sera pas beau ŕ voir quand ils se
seront fait battre par un bus scolaire.
Ok, c'est parti.
C'est quoi ce bordel ?
Galactica, ici Racetrack,
j'ai perdu le contrôle
de mon propulseur RCS arričre droit.
Skulls, ramčne tes fesses ici.
Galactica, ici Ractrack, en approche.
Dégagez le pont pour
un atterrissage d'urgence.
Racetrack, ici Galactica,
le pont est dégagé.
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.
Approche difficile.
Trop difficile !
Oů est l'Amiral ?
Oů est-il ?
Et que faites-vous ŕ prendre des notes
en restant planté lŕ, M. Je-fais-du-zčle.
Vous devriez ętre lŕ dehors,
ŕ essayer de trouver ces personnes,
quelles qu'elles soient !
Peu importe ce que vous dîtes,
Monsieur.
Tu peux lire l'ancien texte,
pas vrai, Gaďus ?
Les fils d'Ar-es ?
Ares. Les fils d'Ares.
Ce sont les personnes qui ont fait ça.
Evidemment, un groupe de
dissidents intégristes.
Męme si tout ce qu'il essaye de faire
est de protéger les anciens Dieux.
Les anciens Dieux
meurent difficilement.
Męme parmi tes disciples.
Je vous ai déjŕ vue auparavant.
Votre nom est...
ne dîtes rien, hum...
ça commence par un M.
- Lilly.
- Lilly.
Qu'avez-vous dans les mains, Lilly ?
Asklepius.
Le Dieu de la guérison.
Je sais que vous allez guérir
notre peuple.
Mais j'ai pensé...
Les anciens Dieux contre-attaquent.
Ces condensateurs sont toujours chauds.
Faites attention, Chef.
Prenez mon gant.
Bon sang.
C'est ma faute, je ne l'ai pas changé.
Ouais, nous aurions pu mourir.
- C'était dans votre poche ?
- Pas besoin de faire ça.
Tu as raison, nous allons bien.
C'est bon.
Ça l'est ?
Skulls, ça l'est ?
- Galen.
- Je n'ai pas besoin d'ętre protégé.
Tu peux me dire que j'ai merdé.
Personne n'a été blessé, ok ?
Oubliez ça.
- Vous ętes simplement humain.
- Non !
Ne dis pas ça !
Dis-moi que j'ai merdé !
Dis-le !
Dis moi que j'ai merdé !
N'importe lequel d'entre vous.
Lâches !
Chef, je peux m'en charger.
Pourquoi ne feriez-vous pas une pause ?
Sors du raptor Figurski.
Les gens ont de la place dans leur
coeur pour une seule grande croyance,
toi ou les anciens Dieux.
Laquelle est-ce que cela sera ?
Pourquoi ne puis-je pas
ętre juste un homme ?
Dois-je vraiment combattre les
Dieux tout seul ?
Mais imagine l'homme que tu
seras quand tu le feras.
Certainement quelqu'un de magnifique,
plus fort que la vie, divin.
De quoi parles-tu ?
Ce n'est pas du tout ŕ propos de ça.
C'est ŕ propos de ceci.
Arrętez !
Arrętez.
C'est inacceptable.
Nous avons été ciblés ŕ cause de
ce en quoi nous croyons par ceux
qui répondent ŕ des Dieux qui méritent
aucun intéręt dans notre monde.
Ils veulent nous faire peur.
Et je suis fatigué d'avoir peur.
L'heure est venue de prendre position.
Et cette heure, c'est maintenant.
Gaďus, que... que faites-vous ?
Oů allez-vous ?
Gaďus ?
Nous voulons la justice,
pas ces anciens Dieux stupides !
Monsieur, nous sommes en plein office.
Vraiment ?
Mais qui servez-vous ?
- Je dois vous demander de partir.
- Vraiment ?
Servez-vous Zeus ?
Apparemment, le roi des Dieux,
qui se trouve aussi ętre,
laissez-moi vous le dire, un violeur.
Enclin ŕ donner naissance
de son propre sang.
C'est trčs probable, n'est-ce pas ?
Les Dieux me terrassent.
- Qu'allez-vous faire ?
- Soyez maudit.
Vous n'ętes qu'une sorcičre ignorante,
racontant des histoires
et des mensonges.
Peut-ętre voulez-vous
que je prie Asklepius,
qui a guéri les plaies avec
le sang des Gorgons,
ou Aphrodite ou Artemis ou
n'importe lequel de ce ramassis !
C'est affreux !
Dégage de lŕ, vieille sorcičre hideuse.
C'est le genre de ramassis
que vous faites !
Je ne serai pas détruit par ça !
Suis-je en retard ?
Non, ce n'était pas un traitement.
C'était juste un test sanguin.
Vous avez apporté un nouveau livre ?
Quelque chose de différent cette fois.
C'est un classique.
Mon favori.
Le faucon des mers,
je ne l'ai pas lu depuis des années.
Je ne me rappelle plus de la fin.
Moi non plus.
Je n'ai jamais lu la fin.
Vous plaisantez. C'est votre favori.
Je l'aime tant,
je ne veux pas le finir.
Donc je le préserve.
Peut-ętre que je devrais le faire.
C'est une mauvaise idée.
Peut-ętre pas.
Laissez-moi prendre ça.
D'accord, merci.
Baltar est de retour en cellule.
Profanation d'un temple.
C'est une vengeance pour ce qu'il
lui est arrivé ce matin.
C'était brutal.
Mon personnel essaye de trouver tout
ce qu'il peut sur les Fils d'Ares.
Personne ne parle.
Baltar sait qu'il y a des irréductibles
religieux dans les environs,
mais il continue ŕ provoquer.
Je ne peux avoir de guerre
religieuse dans cette flotte.
Oh, s'il vous plaît, non.
Parce que l'affaire va devenir
notre fichue responsabilité,
la vôtre et la mienne.
Sérieusement Bill, il reste 30 000
personnes et ils ne sont pas contents
tant qu'ils ne se tapent pas dessus.
Est-ce ce que nous sommes devenus ?
Non, c'est lui.
Baltar a une façon étonnante
de provoquer tout ce foutoir.
Je me demande s'il serait
pręt ŕ rester en cellule
indéfiniment, pour sa propre sécurité.
Et faire de lui un martyr ?
Hors de question.
Ces filles, groupies,
sexuelles je ne sais quoi,
pensent déjŕ qu'il est un Dieu.
Donc on l'éjecte du Galactica.
Non, je le veux proche.
Je vais ŕ la cellule.
Vous voulez le voir ?
Je veux qu'il me voit.
Nous n'avons męme pas attendu demain ?
Vous avez demandé ce que je voulais.
Je veux savoir ce que l'on ressent aprčs
avoir tué des milliards d'humains,
d'avoir tout ce sang sur les mains.
Réfléchissez-y bien.
Parce que c'est ce que je veux.
Je peux le ressentir.
Vous pensez vraiment
que je ne pourrais pas ?
Vraiment ?
Oů l'avez-vous arręter ?
Y'a-t-il un bouton dans votre
tęte qui permet d'y échapper ?
Vous parlez comme si nous étions
différents, mais ce n'est pas le cas.
Parez !
Vous travaillez tard
ou vous vous levez tôt, Chef ?
Vous parlez comme si j'étais faite
de fils et de connecteurs.
Regardez.
Des veines, pas des cables.
Nous sommes pareils.
Vous voyez que nous sommes pareils ?
Alors dites moi.
Vous dire quoi ?
Comment vous vivez
avec ce que vous avez fait.
Demandez-vous l'absolution ?
Le pardon ?
Je peux vous l'offrir.
Repos.
Sortez.
Dites moi quel est le problčme.
Non. Vous n'avez rien ŕ m'offrir.
Nous ne sommes pas pareils.
Vous dormiez ?
C'est pour quoi cette fois ?
Vous ętes venue me fouiller ?
Ou ce pourrait-il
que votre présence ici
signifie que la Présidente a été
mise au courant de ma situation.
Elle a été examinée.
- Vraiment ?
- Ardamment.
Voilŕ ce qu'il en est.
Je veux que vous me regardiez, Gaďus.
Regardez-moi.
C'est une perruque.
Je suis mourante.
Si vous regardez dans mes yeux.
Allez-y, regardez.
Vous pouvez probablement le voir.
Je suis vraiment désolé.
Non, non
Je ne veux pas de votre pitié.
Je fais toujours mon travail.
En fait, je vais pourchasser ardamment
les personnes qui vous ont attaqué.
Et je vais limiter la taille des
rassemblements publics pour protéger
votre peuple, mais...
je vais quitter ce monde dans
trčs peu de temps.
Et je suis curieuse de savoir ŕ
quoi cela va ressembler,
j'ai donc fait quelques recherches.
Certaines personnes disent que
lorsque que l'on approche de sa mort,
on se fiche des rčgles, des lois,
et de la moralité.
Vous me menacez ?
Non, non, je vous dis juste
d'avoir une vie clame.
Et je mourrai d'une mort calme.
Et tout le monde sera content.
C'est juste que je ne suis plus
d'humeur ŕ vous satisfaire.
Et c'est...
... tout.
Vous allez ętre libéré, donc...
soyez prudent.
Hé, Chef.
Elle nous manque ŕ tous, Chef.
Je comprendrais
si vous aviez besoin de temps.
Ou męme si vous aviez besoin de plus
de travail pour vous occuper.
Personne ne sait comment réagir
face ŕ une telle perte,
ou ce dont on a besoin.
Je n'ai pas besoin
d'un traitement de faveur.
Je suppose qu'elle ne pouvait pas
le supporter, hein ?
Ętre marié ŕ un Cylon ?
Ętre la mčre
d'une abomination métissée ?
- Voilŕ monsieur.
- Merci.
C'était une femme bien.
Si vous croyez vraiment ça,
vous ne l'auriez pas menacée
de la coller contre
un mur et de la tuer.
Tout va bien, c'est bon.
J'ai pensé le faire
plusieurs fois moi-męme.
Croyez-moi.
Chef...
Combien finissent avec celles
avec qui elles veulent vraiment ętre ?
Ętre limité par un certain
nombre d'options ?
Pourquoi ?
Parce que les personnes que nous
voulons vraiment, celles que l'on aime,
sont mortes ou mourantes,
ou se sont révélées ętre des Cylons
et elles ne le savaient pas.
Si Boomer avait...
- Ecoutez.
- Si j'avais su.
- Ecoutez.
- Non.
- Allons-y.
- Non, non.
Je ne savais pas.
- Rentrons.
- Je ne savais pas.
Donc j'ai fait l'autruche,
j'ai pris ça, et j'ai fait ma vie !
J'ai fait ma vie avec ses cris
perçants, ses yeux mornes et vides,
la puanteur de sa bouillie de choux.
Et pourquoi ? Parce que c'est ma vie !
C'est la vie que j'ai choisie.
Et ça me va, mais vous savez quoi ?
Ce n'est pas vrai.
Je n'ai pas choisi cette vie.
Ce n'est pas ma putain de vie.
Que diable vous est-il arrivé ?
Ne faites pas ça.
Ne faites pas ça ŕ sa mémoire.
Vous savez quoi ?
Je suis désolé de ne pas le faire
de la façon dont vous souhaitiez,
ou celle que vous feriez.
Mais je ne ferai pas un ange d'une
personne qui n'en était pas un.
Mais je vois que vous oui.
Et maintenant vous ętes venus ici
pour ętre dans mon club,
mais vous n'ętes pas dans mon club.
Vous ne savez pas
dans quel putain de club je suis.
Parce que vous n'avez jamais
posé les bonnes questions.
Chef, sortons d'ici.
Non.
Pourquoi ne partez-vous pas ?
Prendre soin
de votre précieux vaisseau.
Arrętez ça.
Arrętez tout ça.
Parce que sinon,
je vais devoir prendre des mesures.
- Alors fermez-la.
- Génial !
Faites-le !
S'il vous plaît !
Pour l'amour des Dieux, dégradez-moi !
Virez-moi de ce putain de vaisseau !
Expert Tyrol,
je veux que vous ayez quitté
mon hangar avant
de mettre en danger d'autres pilotes.
Présentez-vous demain matin ŕ 6h
au contremaître Bassom
pour une réaffectation.
Compris ?
Bien sűr vous avez le droit
de prendre des mesures d'urgence,
mais vous avez fait du forcing, une
fois la sessions terminée.
Oui, c'est ça.
C'est une mesure
pour contrôler la foule.
J'ai aussi autorisé la réparation
d'un ascenseur de cargaison,
voulez-vous en parler aussi ?
Contrôler la foule,
ça me donne l'impression
d'ętre mis en place uniquement pour
arręter l'organisation de Gaďus Baltar.
Vous voulez dire son culte ?
Oui, et bien son culte a été attaqué.
Et d'aprčs ce que
j'ai entendu dans la flotte,
c'était assez brutal.
C'était brutal.
Exactement.
Et cette mesure est faite pour
protéger ces personnes.
S'ils ne se rassemblent pas, ils ne
provoqueront pas de ressentiment.
Mais les restreindre, tout en autorisant
d'autres tendances plus virulentes.
Oů que soit Gaďus Baltar,
la violence arrive.
S'il ne la cause pas, il l'attire.
Mon travail, M. Adama,
est et sera toujours,
de préserver la sécurité du peuple.
Mme la Présidente, je me dois de
vous demander si cette résolution
pourrait ętre utilisée pour
disperser d'autres groupes religieux.
Absolument pas.
Gaďus Baltar est un cas spécial.
Vous le savez.
Et nous faisons de lui un cas spécial.
Et comment faisons-nous ça ?
Nous alimentons son débat.
Aprčs tout, pręche-t-il la violence ?
- Les actes immoraux ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Je n'ai jamais été ŕ un de ses...
comment les appellent-ils ? Offices ?
Ce n'est pas si éloigné de ce en quoi
certains de nos disciples
de Mithras croient.
Il y a des Mithrasiens
parmi les Gemeniens.
Cet ordre doit-il s'appliquer ŕ eux ?
Calmez-vous.
Nous parlons de Gaďus Baltar.
Tout le monde ici a subi la
tragédie de New Caprica.
Avons-nous oublié ?
Voulez-vous soumettre cet ordre
- ŕ un vote du Quorum ?
- Non.
Nous pouvons l'outrepasser,
Mme la Présidente.
Je ne peux accepter ça.
Vous pouvez outrepasser, et vous ne
pouvez pas l'accepter, M. Adama ?
Alors soumettez-le ŕ un vote.
Et si vous contrez cet ordre, vous
pouvez tous retouner ŕ vos concitoyens,
leur dire ce que vous avez fait,
et que nous, le peuple,
allons triompher.
Mais pensez ŕ ce que
cela va vous coűter.
Parce que vous vous rappelez tous
de ce que c'était quand Gaďus Baltar
avait une influence politique.
Et vous devriez ętre effrayés ŕ l'idée
de ce que cet homme ferait avec
une dévotion religieuse aveugle.
Alors allez-y.
Votez.
Devrais-je m'habituer
ŕ me réveiller avec ce visage ?
Vous voyagez léger.
Une discussion informelle.
Juste vous et moi.
Et les hommes derričre les caméras.
Vous n'avez pas répondu ŕ ma question.
Vous voulez savoir comment ça marche ?
Si je peux me déconnecter
de la douleur ?
Pouvez-vous ?
Je veux souffrir.
C'est comme ça que j'apprends.
J'ai contribué
ŕ la destruction de l'humanité.
Mais en męme temps,
j'ai appris, parce que...
parce que je suis tombée amoureuse.
D'un homme.
Et il était mortel.
Et faillible.
Et il avait un tel orgueil.
Il pensait savoir tout sur tout.
Et je l'ai aimé de tout mon coeur.
Et un jour, j'ai réalisé
que je ne pourrais pas ętre
avec lui pour toujours.
J'ai compris ce que j'avais fait.
Comment je l'avais trahi,
ainsi que l'hummanité.
Et cette douleur m'a permis
de comprendre la mort.
Baltar pourrait mourir.
- Et je l'ai aimé.
- Non.
- Le coeur de Baltar était éphémčre.
- Non.
Le corps de Baltar
était fręle entre mes mains.
Non, nous n'allons pas parler du corps
fręle de cet enfoiré de Gaďus Baltar !
La porte !
La porte !
Rompez.
Dégagez !
Merde, que va-t-il lui faire ?
Je peux vous dire comment l'arręter.
Comment ?
La douleur m'apprend la culpabilité.
Il y a de la sagesse lŕ-dedans.
De la clarté.
Vous vous connaissez.
La douleur.
Nos esprits ont été conçus
au modčle des vôtres.
Nous apprenons des choses
sur votre fonctionnement
que vous n'avez jamais sues.
Quand vous souffrez,
c'est lŕ que vous apprenez
qui vous ętes vraiment.
Quand vous vous concentrez aussi
précisement que la pointe d'un couteau.
Je peux vous redonner cette clarté.
Je suis désolé M., je suis pas
autorisé ŕ vous laisser entrer.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Que faites-vous ?
Il y a dejŕ 12 personnes ŕ l'intérieur.
- Vous pouvez compter, vraiment ?
- Oui, M.
Vous ne pouvez pas entrer
sans violer le décret
- d'urgence 170.
- Laissez-moi sortir,
- il pourra rentrer.
- Si elle sort,
- alors je peux entrer.
- Tout le monde reste
ŕ l'interieur pour sa propre sécurité.
- C'est absurde. Vous...
- J'ai des ordres.
- Mais je vis ici, OK ?
Je vis ici, ainsi que ces femmes.
Oů sommes-nous supposés aller ?
C'est ŕ toi de jouer, Gaďus.
Avance. Fais face.
Je veux pas ętre un héros
Je veux juste aller me coucher,
Regarde-moi !
Je te promets.
Avance et tu ne seras pas blessé.
- Promis ?
- Oui,
tu pourras te coucher ŕ l'intérieur.
Arrętez, Monsieur.
Enlčve tes sales pattes de lŕ,
putain de saloperie de machine !
Peux-tu sentir ça, Saul ?
Peux-tu ressentir sa clarté ?
Restez au sol,
ou dégagez la zone, Monsieur.
Tu dois le faire.
La récompense surpasse le coűt.
Je veux rester ŕ terre.
Je veux vraiment rester au sol.
Non.
Restez ŕ terre,
s'il vous plaît, Monsieur !
Attendez, attendez, stop !
Lieutenant.
Repos.
Le quorum vient d'avoir
une session d'urgence.
Tous les droits sont rendus
ŕ cette congrégation.
Vous pouvez...
vous pouvez rentrer chez vous.
- Personne ne vous arrętera.
- Oh, Gaďus.
Merci.
Je ne l'ai pas fait pour vous.
Vous le faites parce que
votre Dieu vous y astreint.
Ok, ok.
Lee n'a aucune idée.
Il n'a vraiment aucune idée.
Avez-vous écouté ce que je disais ?
Il y a des réalités auxquelles
il refuse de se confronter.
C'est le problčme, bien sűr.
Il fait ce qu'il pense ętre juste.
Oui, c'est Lee.
C'est sans doute juste, mais
parfois la chose juste est un luxe,
qui peut avoir
de fâcheuses conséquences.
On dirait qu'il ne veut pas
admettre l'évidence.
Ok, j'arręte lŕ.
Je ne suis pas sensée me stresser
pendant mon traitement.
Voulez-vous lire le prochain chapitre ?
Je vous avertis que l'on entame
la partie que je n'ai pas encore lue.
Oh lŕ lŕ...
Serez-vous capable de continuer ?
Chapitre 7...
Le radeau ne naviguait pas
aussi bien que je le pensais.
Les vagues menaçaient
souvent de le submerger.
Je n'avais pas peur de mourir.
J'avais peur du vide
que je ressentais en moi.
Je ne pouvais rien ressentir.
C'est ce qui me faisait peur.
Cela s'insinuait dans mes pensées.
Cela les envahissait.
Cela paraissait bon.
Encore.
Non.
Continuez.
Non, j'ai fait une erreur.
Ce n'est pas ce dont vous avez besoin.
<i>Je ne suis pas un prętre.</i>
Je n'ai jamais été un homme bon.
J'étais, en fait,
un homme profondément égoďste.
mais cela ne compte pas, vous voyez.
Quelque chose dans l'univers m'aime.
Quelque chose dans l'univers
aime l'entité que je suis.
Je choisis de nommer cette chose
Dieu.
Un étincelle particuličre qui brűle
dans l'âme de chaque ętre vivant.
Si vous cherchez en vous-męme,
vous trouverez aussi cette étincelle.
Vous le ferez,
mais vous devrez chercher.
Profondément.
Aimez vos défauts.
Acceptez-les.
Si Dieu les accepte,
comment peuvent-ils ętre des défauts ?
Aimez-vous.
Vous devez vous aimer.
Si nous ne nous aimons pas,
comment pourrions-nous
aimer les autres ?
<i>et quand nous saurons
ce que nous sommes,</i>
<i>alors nous trouverons la vérité
ŕ propos des autres.</i>
<i>Voyez ce qu'ils sont,</i>
<i>la vérité ŕ leur sujet.</i>
<i>Et vous savez ce qu'est la vérité,</i>
<i>la vérité ŕ leur sujet,</i>
<i>ŕ votre sujet.</i>
ŕ mon sujet,
le savez-vous ?
La vérité est que nous sommes
tous parfaits,
tels que nous sommes.
Dieu aime seulement ce qui est parfait,
et il vous aime.
Il vous aime car vous ętes parfait.
Vous ętes parfait
tels que vous ętes.
Merci de votre patience
et de votre fidélité...
Merci ŕ toute la team...
On se retrouve Dimanche prochain

TWELVE CYLON MODELS
SEVEN ARE KNOWN
FOUR LIVE IN SECRET
ONE WILL BE REVEALED
previously,on battlestar galactica.
you'll be safe here,gaius.
Please,god,don't let this child die.
God answered your prayers,
- you have to see.
- What?
look at him.
and no trace of a fever.
it's a miracle.
Tory,tory,tory.
Fancy finding you in the cafeteria.
You have an abundance of feeling.
I suppose I could be a cylon.
Cylons can feel.
You believe that?
Yeah,I do actually.
I want to explain.
She sought us out.
You know what has to be done here.
Now,it would be better for
her sake if it was you.
Let's say cally does find out.
What do we do then?
The last thing we need is for
your cylon-hating wife
to find out there's a bunch of
skinjobs running around this ship.
And that her husband is one of them.
Ll stay the frak away from me!
I heard you.
You're cylons.
A bunch of frakking skinjobs.
I couldn't keep you safe
from harm,my love,
but I kept you in my heart.
You were the breath in my lungs,
the blood in my veins,
the light in my eye,and now that breath is gone.
That blood and the light are gone.
I am left,a voice.
And the lords of kobol,as many
and as varied as mortal men,
must bend down and lean low to hear
that voice and hear my lament.
With all our thoughts and love,
calandra henderson tyrol,
we send your spirit into the universe.
So say we all.
so say we all.
I liked that service.
It's not for me,I'll tell you that.
I know,but I want you to know what I like.
It was lovely.
Thank you.
Why do they have to do these things at dawn?
It's all right.
They do because they have to.
I'm sorry.
Let me know if you need anything.
Thank you.
Sorry about your loss.
Sorry,chief.
What the frak was that?
Get us all killed.
Chief.
I'm--I'm so sorry.
What's it up to today?
Same as-- sleeping,pacing.
Don't know how it doesn't go nuts.
Probably turns its brain off.
Frakkin' toaster.
Yeah.
Colonel.
Your request to see the child,
hera agathon,has been denied.
And you felt the need to come all the way
down here in person to tell me that again?
You think I want to come down here?
We're done.
I think we're not.
You come every day.
but you never ask questions anymore.
Is there something that you want from me?
Is there something that you need?
Stay back.
See you tomorrow,colonel.
door!
What was that at the service this morning?
Why don't you get on the wireless
and tell the fleet about us?
Are you going to deal with that kid?
Probably needs to be changed.
All right.
You think cally killed herself
because of you,don't you?
She thought we were having an affair.
But we weren'T.
I don't even know what I am anymore.
I don't know which of my memories are real.
I don't know that I've had one action
in my life that isn't programmed.
Galen,you're perfect.
You don't need guilt.
We were made to be perfect.
what is that?
More of baltar's crap?
So.
you just live without guilt?
Just shut it down.
No,that wasn't the deal.
Colonel,you said it yourself.
Be the man you want to be till the day you die.
We're still the same people,aren't we?
Of course,we are.
You shut up.
That is not the same as human.
Like we're stronger,right?
Chief,what you're feeling is what
a man feels when this happens.
It's normal,and it's human.
And it's not gonna end anytime soon.
It'll be there every day.
You'll see her every day.
You'll see her.
be a man,chief.
Feel what you gotta feel.
But don't risk us.
Come on,tory.
Just think about it.
Think about what we are.
What we can do.

Dear gods,what.
Gods?
Thought there was only one.
What are you doing?
Pulling one hair from your head at a time.
It's intense,isn't it?
Yeah.
It happens at the same time
as a pleasurable touch.
Frak!
- Signals get crossed,don't they?
- Yeah.
It's hard to tell the pleasure from the pain.
Yeah.
Okay,listen,I think that...
you're very strong,aren't you?
You really.
I think I preferred it when you cried.
if you assume that god forgives
you,then it's gone,right?
Erased?
Forgiveness.
you mustatonsecre the sin.
- Make it benign.
- Oh,yeah.
- Bad becomes good.
- Oh,yes,it does.
Pain becomes pleasure.
and doesn't that mean,
if you really become one with god,
you can never do wrong?
Noll,,um,not really,because that wou.
That would more than imply
that we're all perfect.
- Perfect?
- Yeah.
- Perfect just as we are.
- No,no,no!No!
Go on,go,get out!
Where is gaius baltar?
He isn't here.
You,on your feet.
Find him.
Where is he?
I don't know.
security alert.
Deck 8,section 14.
One minute! go!go!go!
we're coming back r gaius baltar.
frak!
Finishing up,chief?
Yeah,just give me one more relay.
I think it's a boy.
Here you go,chief.
Nice to be small,huh?
Chief,we ready to go?
I gotta get out of here.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Raptor away.Readings nominal.
racetrack/ redwing.
We been waiting for that school
bus of yours all day.
School bus,huh?
What's that make those things?
Bicycles?
Racing cars,sweetheart.
top fuel racers.
It's not gonna look very good when
they get beat by a school bus.
Okay,let's ride.
What the frak?
Galactica/ racetrack,I have no control
in my port rear lower rcs thruster.
Skulls,get your ass up here.
galactica/racetrack,coming about.
Clear port landing deck for emergency landing.
racetrack/galactica,emergency landing cleared.
One,two,three,four.
One,two,three.
Coming in hot.
too hot!
Where's the admiral?
Where is he?
And what are you doing,taking notes,
standing here,mr.Officious?
You should be out there,right now,
trying to find the people,whoever they are!
Whatever you say,sir.
You can read the old text,can't you,gaius?
sons of ar-is?
Ares.Sons of ares.
they're the people who committed this attack.
Obviously,a fundamentalist splinter group.
Although,all they're doing is trying
to protect the old gods.
old gods die hard.
Even among your people.
I've seen you here before.
Your name is.
don't tell me,um,begins with "M.
- Lilly.
- Lilly.
What's in your hand,lilly?
Asklepius.
The god of healing.
I know you'll heal our people.
But I thought.
the old gods are fighting back.
those capacitors are still hot.
Watch yourself,chief.
Take my glove.
Frak me.
My fault,didn't get swapped out.
Yeah,we could have died.
- Was that in your pocket?
- We don't have to do this.
You're right,we're okay.
It's okay.
Is it?
Skulls,is it?
Galen.
I don't need to be patted on the head.
You can tell me I frakked up.
Nobody got hurt,ok?
Forget it.
- You're only human.
- No!
Don't say that!
Tell me I frakked up!
Say it!
Tell me I frakked up!
Any one of you.
Cowards!
Chief,uh,I can handle this.
Why don't you take a little down time?
Get out of the raptor,figurski.
people have room in their
hearts for one great belief,
you or the old gods.
Which one will it be?
Why can't I just be a man?
Do I really need to take on
the gods single-handed?
Oh,but imagine the kind of man
you'll be when you do.
Surely such a man must be magnificent,
larger-than-life,godlike himself.
What are you talking about?
It's not about that at all.
It's about this.
Stop!
Stop.
This is unacceptable.
We have been targeted because of
what we believe by those
who answer to faceless gods that bear
no relevance in our world.
They want us to be afraid.
And I'm tired of being afraid.
The time has come to make a stand.
And that time is now.
Gaius,what-- what are you doing?
Where are you going?
Gaius?
We ****** These stupid old gods!
Sir,we're having a service.
Are you?
But whom are you serving?
- I have to ask you to leave.
- Do you?
Would you be serving zeus?
Apparently,king of the gods,
who also happened to be,
let me tell you,a serial rapist.
Prone to giving birth out
of his own forehead.
That's very likely,isn't it?
Well,gods strike me down.
- Oh,what are you going to do?
- Damn you.
You ignorant witch,telling
the people lies and stories.
Maybe you want me to pray to asklepius,
who healed wounds with the
blood of gorgons,
or aphrodite or artemis or
any other of this rubbish!
How awful!
Out of the way,you hideous old witch.
That's the kind of rubbish that you made!
I will not be destroyed at this level!
Am I that late?
No,this wasn't a treatment.
It was just a blood test.
You brought a new book?
Uh,yes.
Something different this time.
It's a classic.
My favorite.
Searider falcon,I haven't read it in years.
I don't remember how it ends.
I don't either.I never read the ending.
You're kidding.It's your favorite.
I like it so much,I don't want it to be over.
So I'm saving it.
Maybe I should do that.
That's a bad idea.Maybe not.
Let me do that for you.
Okay,thanks.
Baltar's back at home in the brig again.
Desecration of a temple.
It's his revenge for what
happened to him this morning.
It was brutal.
I have my personnel trying to track down
anything on the sons of ares.
But nobody's talking.
The thing is that baltar knows that there
are religious hardliners in dogsville,
but he continues to provoke.
I just can't have a religious war in this fleet.
Oh,please,no.
Then the whole damn thing will become our
frakkin' responsibility,yours and mine.
Seriously,bill,we have 30,000 people
left and they're not happy
unless they're kicking each other's teeth in.
This is what we've become?
No,it's him.
Baltar has an uncanny way of
stirring up all the crap.
I wonder if he'd be willing to stay in lockdown,
indefinitely,for his own safety.
And make a martyr out of him?No way.
Those girly,groupie,sex whatever-they-are,
they already think he's a god.
So we kick him off of the galactica.
No,I want him close.
I'm going to the brig.
You want to see him?
I want him to see me.
Oh,we didn't even make it to tomorrow,did we?
You asked what I want.
I want to know how it feels to have
killed billions of human beings,
to have all that blood on your hands.
Think it through.
Because that's what I want.
I feel it.
Do you really think that I couldn't?
Do you?
Or do you turn it off?
Is there a switch in your
head that you turn off?
You talk like we're different,
but you know we're not.
Weapons.
Working late,or up early,chief?
You act like you think
I'm made of switches and relays.
Look.
veins,not wires.
We're the same.
Do you see we're the same?
Then tell me.
Tell you what?
How you live with what you've done.
Saul,are you asking for absolution?
Forgiveness?
I can give you that.
Stand down.
Step outside.
Just tell me what the trouble is.
No.You have nothing to offer me.
We're not the same.
Were you asleep?
What is it this time?
Here to strip-search me?
Or could it possibly be
that your presence here
means that the president has been
made aware of my situation.
It's being looked into.
- Is it really?
- Aggressively.
Now here's the thing.
I want you to look at me,gaius.
Just look at me.
This is a wig.
I'm dying.
Now,if you look in my eyes.
go ahead,look.
You can probably see it.
I'm very sorry.
No,no,no,no,I don't want your pity.
I'm still doing my job.
In fact,I'm gonna aggressively pursue
the men that attacked you.
And I'm going to limit the size of public
assemblies to protect your people,but.
I'm going to be slipping away
from this life very soon.
And I've gotten kind of curious as
to what that's going to be like,
and so,I did some research.
And there are some people who say that
when people are getting closer to their death,
they just don't care as much about rules
and laws and conventional morality.
Are you threatening me?
No,no,I'm just saying have a quiet life.
And I'll die a quiet little death.
And everyone will be happy.
It's just that I'm not in the
mood any longer to indulge you.
And that'S.
all.
And you are being released,so.
stay safe.
Hey,chief.
We all miss her,chief.
I understand if you need some time off.
Or even if you might need more
shifts to keep yourself busy.
No one knows how they're going
to react to loss like this,
or what they're gonna need.
I don't need special treatment.
I guess she just couldn't take it,huh?
Being married to a cylon?
Being the mother of a half-breed abomination?
- *****
- Thank you.
She was a good woman.
If you really believe that,
you wouldn't have threatened
to stick her up against a bulkhead and shoot her.
It's okay,though.
I thought about doing it many times myself.
Believe me.
Chief,it's...
how many of us ended up with the people
we really wanted to be with?
Got stuck with the best of limited options?
And why?
Because the ones we really wanted,
the really loved,were dead and dying,
or turned out to be cylons
and they didn't know it.
If boomer had.
- listen.
- if I had known.
- Listen,let'S.
- no.
- Let's go.
- No,no.
I didn't know.
- let's go home
- I didn't know.
So I buried my head in the sand
and I took it and I settled!
I settled for that shriek,
those dull vacant eyes,
the boiled cabbage stench of her.
And why?Because this is my life!
This is the life I picked.
And it's fine,but you know what?It's not.
I didn't pick this life.
This is not my frakkin' life.
What the hell's gotten into you?
Don't do this.
Don't do this to her memory.
You know what?
I'm sorry if I'm not gonna do this
the way you want me to,
or the way you might.
But I will not make an angel out of
someone who wasn't an angel.
But I can see you have.
And now you've come down here to be in my club,
but you're not in my club.
You don't know what frakkin' club I'm in
'cause you never asked the right questions.
Chief,let's get out of here.
No.
Why don't you go?
Take care of your precious ship.
Stop it.
Stop all of this.
'Cause if you don't,I'm going to have to act on it.
- Now shut up.
- Great!
Do it!
Please!
For the love of gods,please demote me.
Get me off your frakkin' ship!
Specialist tyrol,I want you off my hangar
deck before you endanger another pilot.
You're to report to petty officer bassom
tomorrow morning at 0600 for reassignment.
Do you understand?
of course you have authority
over emergency measures,
but you bulldozed this through
after the session was closed.
Yes ****
It's a crowd control measure.
I also authorized the repair of a cargo elevat
or do you want to talk about that too?
Crowd control?
Looks to me like it was
pretty well designed purely
to stop gaius baltar's organization.
You mean his cult?
Well his "cult" was attacked.
And from what I'm hearing around the fleet,
it was pretty brutal.
It was brutal.
Exactly.
And this measure is designed explicitly
to protect those people.
If they aren't gathering en masse,
they aren't provokreg sentment.
But limits his group,while
permitting more mainstream worship.
wherever gaius baltar is,violence happens.
And if he doesn't cause it,he draws it.
My job,mr.Adama,is and always will be,
to keep the people safe.
Madame president,
I have to wonder tifhis resolution
couldn't be used against other
offshoot religious groups.
Absolutely not.
Gaius baltar is a special case.
You know that.
And we're making him a special case.
And how are we doing that?
We're fueling his argument.
I mean,after all,is he preaching violence?
- Immoral acts?
- I don't know.
I haven't been to one of his...
what are they called?Services?
It's not that far from what some of
our own mithras followers believe.
We have mithrasaries among the gemenese.
Can this order be applied to them?
Clear your heads.
We are talking about gaius baltar.
Everyone in this room
experienced tragedy at new caprica.
Have we forgotten?
Will you open this order
- to a full quorum vote?
- No.
we can override,madam president.
I cannot let this stand.
You can override,and you cannot
let this stand,mr.Adama?
Then you open it up to a vote.
And if you strike this down,
you can all go back to your constituents
and you can tell them what you've done,
and "we,the people," will have triumphed.
But think about what it's gonna cost you.
Because every single one of you remembers
what it was like when gaius
baltar had political power.
And you should be terrified to think about
what this man will do with
blind religious devotion.
So go ahead.
Vote.
Should I get used to waking up to this face?
You're traveling light.
An informal chat.
Just you and me.
and the man watching through the cameras.
You haven't answered my question.
You want to know how I work?
If I can turn off pain?
Can you?
I want the pain.
It's how I learn.
I was instrumental in the
destruction of humanity.
But at the same time,I learned because.
because I fell in love.
With a human man.
And he was mortal.
And fallible.
And he had this incredible pride in himself.
He thought he knew everything there was to know.
And I loved him with my whole heart.
And then one day,I realized
I wouldn't have him forever.
I understood what I'd done.
How I betrayed him and humanity.
And that pain taught me to understand death.
Baltar could die.
- And I loved him.
- No.
- Baltar's heart was ephemeral.
- No.
Baltar's body was fragile in my hands.
No,we are not gonna talk about the
fragile body of gaius frakkin' baltar!
Door!
Door!
Dismissed.
Clear out,out!
Frak,what's he gonna do to her?
I can tell you how to turn it off.
How?
Pain is how I learn from the guilt.
There's wisdom there.
Clarity.
You know yourself there.
Pain.
Our minds were designed based on your minds.
We learn things about how you work
that you've never known.
When you're in pain,that's
when you learn who you really are.
That's when you focus,
sharp as the point of a knife.
I can give you that clarity again.
I'm sorry,sir,I'm not supposed to let you enter.
What's going on?What are you doing?
There are 12 people inside already.
You can count,can you?
Yes,sir,you can't enter without
breaking emergency provision 170.
People,let me out.
- If I leave,then he can come in.
- Yes,if she leaves,
- then I can come in.
- We're asking everyone
- to stay inside for safety reasons.
- Oh,this is absurd.
- You're just counting heads.
- I have my orders.
Yeah,but I live here,okay?
I live here,and so do some of these women.
Where are we supposed to go?
this is your moment,gaius.
Step forward.Make a stand.
Uh,I don't want to be a hero.
I just want to go to bed.
- Go to sleep.
- Look at me.
I promise you.
Step forward,and you will not be hurt.
- Promise me?
- Yes,
you can lie down inside.Go in.
Stop,sir.
gaius!
Get your frakkin' hands off me,
you frakkin' freak machine!
Can you feel it,saul?
Can you feel the clarity of it?
stay down or clear this area,sir!
You have to do this.
The gain will outweigh the cost.
I want to stay down.
I really want to stay down.
No,you don'T.
Stay down,please,sir!
Wait,wait,stop!
Lieutenant.
Stand down.
The quorum has just met
in an emergency session.
Full right of assembly has been restored.
You can,uh,you can go back into your home.
- No one will stop you.
- Oh,gaies.
thank you
I don't do these things for you.
You do them because your god compels you.
Okay,okay.
Lee has no idea.
He really has no idea.
Have you heard anything I said?
There are pragmatic realities he refuses to face.
Well,that'pra oblem,of course.
He's doing what he thinks is right.
Well,yeah,he's lee.
Thing is,it probably is the right thing,but.
sometimes the right thing is a luxury.
And it can have profoundly dangerous consequences.
And yet it's almost as if he
doesn't want that to be true.
Okay,I gotta stop this.
I'm not supposed to get upset during treatment.
Will you read the next chapter?
I must warn you that I'm getting into
the part that I haven't read yet.
Oh dear.
Are you going to be able to continue?
Chapter 7:
The raft was not as seaworthy as I had hoped.
The waves repeatedly threatened to swamp it.
I wasn't afraid to die.
I was afraid of the emptiness that I felt inside.
I couldn't feel anything.
That's what scared me.
It came into my thoughts.
It filled them.
It felt good.
More.
No.
Keep going.
No,I made a mistake.
This isn't what you need.
I'm not a priest.
I've never even been a particularly good man.
I have,in fact,been a profoundly selfish man.
But that doesn't matter,you see.
Something in the universe loves me.
Something in the universe
loves the entity that is me.
I will choose to call this something "god.
A singular spark that dwells
in the soul of every living being.
If you look inside yourself,
you will find this spark too.
You will.
But you have to look.
Deep.
Love your faults.
Embrace them.
If god embraces them,
then how can they be faults?
Love yourself.
You have to love yourself.
If we don't love ourselves,
how can we love others?
and when we know what we are,
then we can find the truth out about others.
See what they are.
The truth about them.
And you know what the truth is,
the truth about them.
About you.
About me.
Do you?
The truth is we are all perfect,
just as we are.
God only loves that which is perfect,
and he loves you.
He loves you because you are perfect.
You are perfect just as you are.

Elle ne peut pas Ítre sťrieuse.
Elle ferait mieux de peindre
avec ses doigts...
Je vous ai assez entendu r‚ler
et gťmir pour le reste de ma vie.
2 jours de plus et
nous rejoignons la flotte, OK ?
En attendant, vous la fermez
et vous faites votre job.
Allez.
Allez.
Allez.
Starbuck ici Hotdog.
Je n'ai pas compris.
Quels sont vos ordres ?
Hotdog ici Demetrius.
Tu connais l'exercice.
Gardez les yeux ouverts
et restez aux cŰtťs de Starbuck.
Je sais que vous Ítes lŗ, quelque part.
Allez.
Starbuck, contact dradis.
Demetrius, nous avons un contact.
Une merde ŗ 1-4-9.
Bien reÁu.
Tous aux postes de combat.
Chauffez les PRL
pour un saut d'urgence.
Aux postes de combat,
aux postes de combat.
Le vaisseau passe en condition 1.
Ceci n'est pas un exercice.
Je rťpŤte
aux postes de combat.
Ceci n'est pas un exercice.
Fils de pute, je le savais.
Demetrius ici Hotdog.
J'ai un visuel.
C'est un raider lourd Cylon.
Starbuck ici Demetrius.
Au rapport.
Au rapport !
Demetrius, il est endommagť
tout le long de la coque.
Starbuck,
quels sont vos ordres ?
Allez.
Parle-moi, tire-moi dessus,
fais quelque chose.
Starbuck,
quels sont vos ordres ?
<i>Kara.</i>
<i>Je suis seul.</i>
<i>Ce n'est pas une attaque.</i>
<i>J'ai su que je te trouverais</i>
<i>et que tu chercherais par ici.</i>
Leoben ?
<i>Je suis ici pour toi</i>
et offrir une trÍve
entre les Cylons et vous.
<i>Une chance pour que
tu termines ton voyage.</i>

Le raider est arrimť au sas arriŤre.
La partie animale
qui le contrŰle semble morte.
Nous avons juste trouvť
le Leoben ŗ bord.
Starbuck a toujours
cette saletť de chance.
S'il avait voulu nous tuer,
nous serions dťjŗ morts.
«a veut juste dire
qu'il attend autre chose.
Kara.
Merci.
Nous priions pour un miracle.
Ce n'ťtait pas un miracle.
C'est comme si je savais
que tu ťtais lŗ dehors.
Je ne dťtecte
aucune ťmission gamma, Monsieur.
Le raider n'a que
des armes conventionnelles.
Aucune bombe atomique.
Bien.
Continuez de chercher
les appareils de traÁage.
Tout ce qui pourrait
rťvťler notre position.
Ne me regarde pas comme Áa.
Je suis dťsolť.
La diffťrence entre celle que tu
ťtais sur New Caprica
et maintenant...
- Je suis toujours la mÍme.
J'ai des yeux. Je peux voir.
Dieu a pris ta main, et t'a purgťe
de tes questions, de tes doutes.
Ton voyage peut enfin commencer.
Mais il reste peu de temps.
Les autres,
ceux que j'ai quittť,
ils ont besoin de ton aide.
Mais pas autant
que tu as besoin de la leur.
Pourquoi ?
Ton ťquipage.
Ils ne te croient pas.
Dis-moi pourquoi tu es lŗ...
Capitaine,
nous devrions dťplacer le prisonnier.
Une planŤte bleue...
entourťe de nuages.
ArrÍtez !
L'hybride.
Quand elle me l'a dťcrite
pour la premiŤre fois,
combien elle ťtait belle,
j'ai pleurť.
Tu dois aller la voir, Kara.
L'hybride, elle te dira des choses.
Des choses extraordinaires.
Nous avons fini.
Sortez-le de lŗ.
Attendez !
Amenez-le dans mes quartiers.
Faites-le !
Il se peut que cela ne prenne
jamais aucun sens.
L'ťquipage du quai m'a dit que vous
ťtiez obsťdť par cet endroit.
Lire les rapports.
Rejouer l'accident encore et encore.
Accident.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
J'ai parlť ŗ Cottle.
Cally ťtait sous Moxopan et Cosapine.
Des antidťpresseurs.
Comment est-elle passťe des
antidťpresseurs au suicide ?
Elle ťtait...
... perturbťe ťmotionnellement.
Elle m'aurait quittť.
Elle n'aurait jamais laissť Nicky.
Donc...
ŗ quoi pensez-vous ?
Quelqu'un l'aurait tuťe ?
Galen, vous devez laisser Áa de cŰtť.
Non, je vais dťcouvrir
ce qui s'est passť.
Et si elle savait ?
Comment aurait-elle pu ?
Elle l'a peut-Ítre senti.
C'ťtait votre femme.
Vous Ítes diffťrent
depuis la nťbuleuse.
Peut-Ítre avait-elle peur de vous.
Peut-Ítre ťtait-ce la volontť de Dieu.
Nous ne savons pas
pourquoi ces choses arrivent.
Mais Dieu le sait.
Et il a des projets pour nous.
Pour n'importe quelle raison,
sa mort, notre rťveil,
vous devez croire
que tout Áa est pour le bien.
Pourquoi Ítes-vous lŗ ?
Parce que Áa nous concerne
tous les deux.
Et je suis lŗ pour vous, Galen.
Je sais exactement
ce que vous traversez.
Cela m'est arrivť.
Jusqu'ŗ ce que GaÔus
m'aide ŗ le rťaliser.
Quoi ?
Peu importe ce qui s'est passť,
ce que j'ai fait,
cela n'a pas d'importance.
Nous pouvons toujours changer.
Vous passez trop de temps avec Baltar.
Je suppose que j'ai manquť
les retrouvailles, hein ?
Alors c'est quoi le truc ?
Leoben, a-t-il dit quelque chose ?
On ne sait pas.
Starbuck a demandť aux gardes
d'attendre dehors, sans les menottes.
Elle a dit qu'elle ne voulait pas
Ítre dťrangťe.
- Je vais aller lui parler.
- Ouais, pourquoi pas ?
Ne la touche pas.
Sam, Sam, arrÍte !
Qu'est-ce qui cloche chez toi, Kara ?
Je comprends pourquoi elle t'aime tant.
Laisse-le tranquille.
Tu sais ce que nous avons ŗ faire.
Rappelle-toi qu'il reste peu de temps.
Faites-le dťgager de lŗ !
Menottez-le et enfermez-le !
Qu'est-ce qui se passe avec toi ?
Kara !
Il peut nous aider.
Les Cylons, ils comprennent
ce qu'il faut faire pour la Terre.
Et tu le crois ?
AprŤs tout ce qu'il t'a fait ?
Kara, il t'a enfermťe pendant
des mois sur New Caprica.
Ces putains de jeux d'esprit.
Je jure devant Dieu
que ce n'est pas un rÍve.
C'est rťel.
Content que vous soyez lŗ.
Vous et Kara,
vous avez arrangť les choses ?
Parce que vous devriez.
Vous n'Ítes pas supposťs
Ítre des ennemis.
Non.
«a sera toi et moi.
Qu'attends-tu de Kara ?
Ce que j'ai toujours voulu.
Qu'elle comprenne sa destinťe.
Ce n'est pas suffisant.
«a l'est pour elle.
Quel est l'article de foi
le plus ťlťmentaire ?
Ce n'est pas tout ce que nous sommes.
Les C-Bucks gŤrent.
Qu'est-ce que tu viens de dire ?
Avant-centre, c'est Áa ?
J'ai vu quelques matchs.
Vous ťtiez bon.
AprŤs la cťlťbritť et les acclamations,
qui ťtiez-vous ?
Juste une autre tÍte
qui faisait vendre des magazines.
Un autre ramassis de conneries,
et vous avez toujours su
que vous ťtiez destinť ŗ plus que Áa.
Vous attendiez juste votre instant
de clartť.
Peut-Ítre que je viens de le trouver.
Vous me tuez moi,
le rÍve de Kara aussi.
Je ne pense pas.
Tu vas te tťlťcharger
dans un autre corps
et dťgueuler d'autres mensonges.
Personne ne reviendra.
On nous a retirť
le droit ŗ la rťsurrection.
Notre vaisseau a ťtť attaquť.
Nous avons survťcu.
Le vaisseau mŤre a ťtť endommagť.
Nous ťtions ŗ la dťrive.
De quoi parles-tu ?
Qui vous a attaquťs ?
Une guerre a ťclatť entre les Cylons.
Un front s'est dressť
entre ceux qui acceptent leur nature
et ceux qui en ont peur.
Bien.
Vous pouvez vous faire sauter
la tÍte autant que vous voulez.
C'est une solution, c'en est une.
Il y en a une autre.
Une alliance.
Laisser nos chemins converger.
Vous nous avez sauvťs
de nos frŤres barbares.
Et notre aÓnť, l'hybride,
montrera ŗ Kara le chemin de la vertu.
Et ensemble, ils nous mŤneront
ŗ la terre promise.
Ensemble, nous trouverons la Terre.
Il a dit que son vaisseau mŤre
a ťtť attaquť,
quíils ont ťtť piťgťs
par leur propre camp.
Donc maintenant,
les Cylons demandent notre aide.
«a c'est une nouvelle.
Il nous propose une alliance avec
son vaisseau mŤre endommagť.
Comment c'est censť fonctionner ?
On est censť les laisser accťder
ŗ notre navigation
et nos systŤmes PRL, et les aider
ŗ sauter loin de leur front.
Ils rejoindront
les forces de la flotte.
Oui.
Si c'est vrai.
Putain.
Vous pensez vraiment faire Áa ?
XO, ťcoutez.
Amener Leoben ŗ bord,
c'ťtait plus que douteux.
Mais sauter
jusqu'ŗ leur vaisseau mŤre ?
C'est du suicide.
Rien n'a ťtť dťcidť.
Et vous croyez en Starbuck
pour prendre la bonne dťcision ?
Parce qu'elle est incontrŰlable.
Qu'est-ce que tu dis ?
Nous sommes dans le flou complet,
Anders.
Dans 2 jours, nous allons manquer
notre rendez-vous avec la flotte.
Nous devons faire quelque chose
avant qu'elle nous fasse
tous tomber avec elle.
Tu parles de mutinerie ?
Parce que Áa en donne
vraiment l'impression.
Tu veux diviser ce vaisseau,
et ťnerver l'ťquipage en faisant
passer Starbuck pour une folle.
Sinon, je propose que vous la fermiez.
Starbuck nous conduit droit
dans un piŤge.
Les Cylons vont capturer le cargo.
Ils obtiendront les coordonnťes
permettant d'atteindre la flotte.
Alors nous avons plutŰt
intťrÍt ŗ ťviter Áa.
Faites machine arriŤre
et prťparez le vaisseau.
DŤs que nous aurons les coordonnťes
du raider de Leoben, nous partirons.
C'est une chance de trouver la Terre !
J'ai bien l'intention de la saisir.
Non pas que je m'en soucie,
mais depuis que j'ai ťtť arrÍtť...
Ou plutŰt battu,
puis-je...
Ai-je raison
de supposer que la Prťsidente
n'a pas ťtť informťe
de mes ťmissions pirates ?
En fait,
je lui ai tout dit ŗ ce propos.
Je lui ai mÍme suggťrť
d'en parler ŗ l'Amiral.
Vraiment ?
Je pense que tu devrais
faire quelque chose ŗ ce sujet.
Ou pas.
MÍme Roslin et Adama
doivent prendre conscience
que le mouvement
prend vie de lui-mÍme.
Il leur faudra plus que quelques coups
au visage pour l'arrÍter.
En vťritť, tu n'es pas prÍt pour une
nouvelle confrontation avec le Quorum.
Tu devras sacrifier
plus de personnes dans ta croisade,
mais ils viennent des bas-fonds.
Aucun d'eux n'est important.
Habille-toi.
Ils t'attendent.
En avons-nous assez ?
Aucune importance Heather,
ils ne viennent pas pour manger.
Ils viennent pour ťcouter
ce que le Dr. Baltar a ŗ dire,
et apprendre de lui, tout comme nous.
Le passť est ťcrit.
Impossible ŗ changer.
Pourquoi tant d'entre nous
vivent dans le passť ?
Avec la honte
de ce que nous avons fait.
Alors que nous pourrions vivre
dans la crainte
de ce que nous pourrions faire.
La crainte
de ce que nous pourrions faire.
Que ferons-nous ?
Attendre l'arrivťe de la spirale
infinie menant aux cieux
lorsque l'humanitť
se sera ťteinte d'elle-mÍme ?
Ou devons-nous
chercher en nous-mÍmes,
pour trouver cette force intťrieure ?
Incroyable que ces gens avalent
les couleuvres de Baltar, non ?
Il faut qu'on parle.
Je n'ai rien ŗ vous dire.
Bien, mais vous pouvez ťcouter.
Venez avec moi.
Je vous ai donnť du temps
ŗ cause de Cally, mais c'est terminť.
Vous devez vous ressaisir. Maintenant.
Relevez la tÍte.
Tout comme vous ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est
censť vouloir dire ?
J'ai entendu dire que vous passiez
du temps enfermť avec Six.
Vous vous souvenez
quand tout Áa a commencť ?
Vous disiez que rien ne changerait
l'homme que vous vouliez Ítre.
Et maintenant Cl ?
Etes-vous toujours
ce bon vieux Saul Tigh ?
Tout ce que j'ai pu faire,
je peux vivre avec.
C'est la diffťrence entre vous et moi.
Je ne peux pas.
Ce que Tory a dans la tÍte, que nous
serions le salut de la race humaine...
Tout ce que je sais,
c'est que s'il y a un dieu,
il doit bien se foutre de nous.
L'EVA est presque terminťe Cpt.
<i>Dťmťtrius, Mathias.</i>
J'ai fini la vťrification
de la section arriŤre.
Quel foutu bordel.
Faites vite Sergent.
Et rentrez au bercail.
<i>Bien reÁu, Athena.</i>
De toute faÁon je commenÁais
ŗ en avoir marre de la vue.
Attendez.
On a une fuite.
Un genre de... Gaz
s'ťchappe d'une fissure dans la coque.
Quelque chose se passe.
Mathias, au rapport.
Mathias, au rapport !
Que faites-vous tous ici ?
La raison de notre prťsence ŗ tous ici
c'est que les vieilles mťthodes
nous ont dťÁus.
Il n'est pas important
que vous soyez croyants
ou pas.
Cela ne fait
aucune diffťrence pour moi.
Vous Ítes tous les bienvenus.
Mr. Tyrol.
Mr. Tyrol.
Je sais
que nous avons eu des diffťrends,
mais je vous supplie ŗ prťsent
de les mettre de cŰtť.
Venez ici et prenez ma main.
Si vous ne le faites pas pour vous,
alors faites-le pour votre femme.
Pour Cally.
Elle n'aurait pas voulu Áa.
Cally n'ťtait pas comme moi.
Elle vous a pardonnť pour New Caprica.
Elle a mÍme lu votre faux manifeste.
Mais pas moi.
Vous pouvez avoir
vos tarťs de moutons.
Ils peuvent Ítre clients de votre
message de pardon.
Mais laissez-moi vous dire.
Il y a des pťchťs
que mÍme votre dieu imaginaire
ne pourra jamais pardonner.
Je ne parle pas d'un dieu imaginaire.
Je vous demande de prendre ma main.
Prenez ma main Mr Tyrol.
Pour Cally.
C'est ce qu'elle aurait voulu.
L‚chez-le !
Laissez-le.
Laissez-le !
Vous ne la connaissiez pas !
J'ai entendu une explosion.
Tout va bien ?
Qu'as-tu fait ? Tu as piťgť
les volets de tylium ?
C'est la Kara que je connais.
Le Raider est en miettes,
espŤce de sale fils de pute !
Le Sergent Mathias est mort.
«a ne te donne aucun foutu remords !
Crois-le ou non,
je n'ai rien ŗ voir avec Áa.
Je n'ťtais mÍme pas sur le pont.
J'ťtais trop occupťe ŗ te croire
au lieu de veiller sur mon ťquipage.
Mon vaisseau ťtait en feu.
Le rťacteur a pu Ítre endommagť.
C'ťtait un piŤge.
Dis-le !
Frappe-moi encore !
Tu t'es servi de moi
pour approcher ce vaisseau.
Combien de fois
m'as-tu tuť sur New Caprica ?
Ne t'arrÍte pas.
- Je t'emmerde !
- Vas-y, fais-le.
Je ne reviendrai pas cette fois.
Promis.
Le vaisseau de rťsurrection est
bien trop loin. Vas-y, fais-le.
Fais-le !
«a ne t'aide pas.
Pas vrai ?
Rien n'est plus comme avant.
N'est-ce pas ?
Que me fais-tu ?
Toute ta vie.
Tu as tournť le dos ŗ la vťritť
en faisant du mal
ŗ ceux qui t'entourent.
En ťvitant de faire face ŗ l'aide
d'ambrosia et de liaisons sans suite.
Mais tu as perdu le goŻt
de ces petites choses.
- Je suis la mÍme.
- Non !
Il y a un vide qui ne peut Ítre rempli
que par la suite de ton voyage.
Que m'est-il arrivť
pendant mes deux mois d'absence ?
Je ne sais pas.
Le Mandala, les peintures, ma mŤre.
«a signifiait quelque chose.
Tu dois faire la paix avec ton passť.
Pourquoi ?
Car cette part de toi a disparu.
Je t'ai dit quand je suis arrivť ici
que tu avais changť.
En te regardant, je ne vois pas
Kara Thrace, je vois...
Un ange baignť par la lumiŤre de Dieu.
Un ange,
dťsireux
de ramener son peuple chez lui.
C'est mauvais, vraiment mauvais.
Elle ne peut pas expliquer celui-lŗ.
Donc tu penses
qu'elle est un Cylon maintenant ?
Starbuck en a tuť plus
que tout autre pilote de la flotte.
Oui, Starbuck peut-Ítre.
D'accord, mais qui a la moindre idťe
d'oý ťtait ce Viper il y a deux mois ?
Je ne suis pas vraiment douťe pour Áa.
Nous devons tous nous souvenir
du Sergent Erin Mathias.
Pleurer sa perte.
Honorer sa mťmoire.
Mathias est morte ŗ cause de moi.
Nous avons tous entendu
les mots, les priŤres,
mais je ne sais pas
si tout cela a encore un sens.
Nous voulons tous croire
qu'elle est morte pour quelque chose.
Mais dans cette guerre, des gens
meurent et c'est juste stupide.
C'est un accident.
Il n'y a aucune noblesse ŗ cela.
Il n'y a rien qu'on puisse dire
pour rendre Áa plus facile.
Ils ont juste disparu.
Je dois vivre avec Áa.
Vous savez. Je sais
que c'ťtait
une mission difficile, et...
Peut-Ítre que je n'ai pas...
Capitaine,
nous avons tťlťchargť les coordonnťes
de rendez-vous dans le PRL.
Nous sommes prÍts pour faire un bond
de retour ŗ la flotte ŗ votre ordre.
On ne retourne pas ŗ la flotte.
- Qu'est-ce que vous dites ?
- On est lŗ pour remplir une mission.
Ce vaisseau mŤre a quelque chose
ŗ voir avec Áa, je le sais.
Cpt Agathon.
Dťverrouillez le vaisseau.
Prťparez un bond.
Vous savez quoi ? Je l'emmerde,
elle et son toutou Cylon.
Ce vaisseau mŤre ne faisait pas
partie de la mission,
et l'un de nous est mort.
Un des nŰtres est mort, et si
on ne part pas tout de suite,
on va tous mourir, compris ?
Laisse tomber Pike !
- Tout le monde se calme !
- Si je ne fais rien on va crever !
- Dťgagez.
- Vous avez vos ordres. Reculez.
Vous devriez choisir votre camp Cpt.
Reculez.
Reculez et Áa n'ira pas plus loin !
Ouais, vous Ítes celui qui protŤge
ce foutu Cylon pas vrai.
Gaius, je ne comprends pas
ce que vous essayez d'accomplir.
- Cet homme...
- Mon message est pour tous.
Surtout ceux qui ne veulent
pas l'entendre.
- ... pas sŻr.
- 5 minutes, c'est tout.
Mr Tyrol.
Il n'y a aucune raison d'avoir peur.
Soyez prudent.
…coutez, Chef, je...
je suis ici pour demander
votre pardon
pour mes prťjugťs.
Vous aviez raison.
Je connaissais ŗ peine votre ťpouse.
Je suis dťsolť.
«a vous dťrange si je...
m'assois...
Je sais que c'est difficile de
donner un sens aux choses, parfois.
Dans ma vie,
j'ai rejoint la flotte
en tant que scientifique,
en tant que sceptique,
en tant qu'homme de raison.
Seulement le destin
n'en fait qu'ŗ sa tÍte,
et maintenant, je comprends
qu'il y a un but.
On change.
On ťvolue.
On peut mÍme apprendre
des choses de cette faÁon.
J'ai commis...
des crimes inconcevables.
On m'offre une derniŤre
chance de me racheter,
parce que j'ai choisi
d'accepter mon destin,
de ne plus me battre.
Je suis tellement dťsolť
pour votre perte, Chef.
Elle ťtait trŤs belle, votre femme
et aussi trŤs spirituelle.
Je ne m'attends pas
ŗ ce que vous me croyiez, mais
j'aurais aimť la connaÓtre mieux.
Merci.
ņ vos postes, ŗ vos postes.
Condition 1 dans tout le vaisseau.
Vas-tu rťellement le faire ?
Je n'ai pas d'autre choix.
Si tu l'as.
Le PRL est prÍt, Capitaine.
Bien.
Compte ŗ rebours.
Capitaine.
Capitaine, je vous demande
de reconsidťrer tout Áa.
Nous n'avons pas le temps.
Si ce níest pas maintenant,
nous serons hors de portťe.
Cela signifie croire le Cylon.
Signifiant que nous croyons que les
coordonnťes de Leoben soient bonnes,
que nous n'irons pas au milieu de
vaisseaux ou au centre d'une ťtoile...
Les ordres du Galactica sont clairs.
Si nous manquons le RDV, Adama
nous dťclarera morts ou prisonniers.
Ils nous abandonneront.
Non. Pas Adama.
…coutez-moi, nous pouvons
sauter jusqu'au Galactica.
Si l'Amiral est d'accord,
on ravitaille,
on envoie une patrouille armťe.
Ne fais pas Áa, Helo.
Je ne peux pas te laisser
risquer la survie de l'ťquipage.
Quand l'Amiral m'a donnť
le commandement,
il a fait confiance ŗ mon instinct.
Trouver le prochain indice,
et voir oý cela mŤne.
Conduire la flotte
vers une terre d'accueil.
C'est ce que j'essaie de faire.
Maintenant, prťparez le bond !
Je suis dťsolť Capitaine
mais je ne peux obťir ŗ cet ordre.
Alors vous Ítes relevť, Capitaine.
Mr Gaeta,
vous Ítes le nouveau XO
Prťparez le bond ŗ mon signal.
Non, Capitaine.
OK, tout le monde doit rťflťchir
ŗ ce qui se passe ici.
Ils y ont rťflťchi, Sam.
Ils l'ont tous fait.
C'est une mutinerie.
Capitaine Thrace,
en tant que XO du Dťmetrius,
et conformťment ŗ l'article 10
du code militaire colonial
je vous relŤve de facto
de votre commandement.
Merci de votre patience
et de votre fidťlitť...
Merci ŗ toute la team...
On se retrouve Dimanche prochain

TWELVE CYLON MODELS
SEVEN ARE KNOWN
FOUR LIVE IN SECRET
ONE WILL BE REVEALED
Previously on Battlestar Galactica:
Helo handpicked a crew for you.
I'm giving you a ship.
We liberated the Demetrius.
A sewage recycling ship.
Now go.
Find a way to Earth.
I'm telling you, guys,
this thing is a setup anyway.
I mean, you think that the old man just
gave her the ship and then cut her loose?
Hey, that's enough of that crap.
The resurrection ship didn't make the jump.
And now Cavil's baseships are breaking formation,
taking positions around our periphery.
They're going to attack.
They've taken out our FTL!
No resurrection ship.
They're really trying to kill us.
Stay the frak away from me!
I heard you.
You're Cylons!
A bunch of frakkin' skinjobs.
You think Cally killed herself
because of you, don't you?
she thought we were having an affair.
But we weren't.
No, that's right.
I'm not a cheater. I'm a Cylon.
I'm not a priest.
But that doesn't matter, you see.
Something in the universe loves me.
God only loves that which is perfect,
and he loves you.
He loves you because you
are perfect just as you are.
Captain.
Captain!
I'm glad you're here.
I might have found something.
Before that, we need to talk about
making our rendezvous with the fleet.
Later.
No, no.
No. Come on.
Here.
What do you think?
Well.
It's hard to say.
Spectroscopics are promising.
But according to this, we already did
two long-range recons of that grid.
Both no joy.
Third time's the charm maybe.
All right,
I'll have Sharon prep to go as soon
as Anders gets back from his scout.
Hey.
What about you?
You been getting any sleep?
I don't know. Not...not much.
It was so clear when I first got back.
If I could...
if I could just focus,
I know that I can find that sound again.
I gotta go see the cap off.
We'll talk when I get back.
Hold up.
I think I'll go with you on this one.
You haven't flown cap since we left the fleet.
I think I'll go with you on this one.
I need you to tell me that
all this somehow makes sense.
This was my husband, James.
My two children, Danya and Reece.
They were on Picon when the Cylons attacked.
What do you feel when you
look at this photograph?
I feel rage
against the Cylons.
Not just the machines,
anyone involved.
The engineers who designed them.
The corporations,
the politicians who provoked this war
and then did nothing to protect us.
And most of all the gods.
The gods.
They stood by and let it all happen.
Yes, I know.
I know.
I am so sorry, Phoebe.
I sympathize.
Unfortunately, the gods cannot be blamed
for not coming to your aid.
It's not because they weren't listening.
It's because they don't exist.
The gods we've been praying to for
thousands of years do not exist.
They can't help you because
they are not real.
We have been pandering to our own
ignorance for far too long.
Now on my own journey I've
been wronged, persecuted.
I prayed to the gods on my knees,
begging them for mercy.
Tortured.
I received nothing in resp...
I could've lived in that abyss of bitterness,
but that will destroy you like nothing else.
But I chose to forgive.
And most importantly, I began with myself.
"Third time's the charm?"
And you just went along with it?
It's called following orders, Lieutenant.
It's called dragging our feet.
Starbuck's pushing our go back
deadline to the last second.
She's afraid of what Adama's gonna say
when he realizes her vision
was just a pipe dream.
You've got to be kidding me.
She's taking a viper out now?
She can't be serious.
Maybe she could do a little finger painting...
I've heard enough bitching
and moaning to last a lifetime.
Two more days and we're
back with the fleet, okay?
Until then, everyone just
shut up and do your jobs.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Starbuck, Hot Dog.
Didn't catch that.
What are your orders?
Hot dog, Demetrius.
You know the drill.
Keep your eyes open and stick
close to Starbuck's wing.
I know you're out here somewhere.
Come on.
Starbuck, Dradis contact.
Demetrius, we've got an inbound.
One bogey bearing 1-4-9er.
Roger that.
Call action stations.
Spool up the FTL for emergency jump.
Action stations, action stations.
Set condition one throughout the ship.
This is not a drill.
Repeat, action stations, action stations.
This is not a drill.
Son of a bitch, I knew it.
Demetrius, Hot Dog.
I've got visual.
Cylon heavy raider.
Starbuck, Demetrius.
Report.
Report!
Demetrius, I'm seeing blast
damage all over this thing.
Starbuck, what are your orders?
Come on.
Talk to me, shoot me, do something.
Starbuck, what are your orders?
Kara.
I'm alone.
It's not an attack.
I knew I'd find you.
Knew you'd be out here searching.
Leoben?
I'm here for you, to offer a truce
between Cylon and human.
And a chance for you to complete your journey.

39,676 SURVIVORS
IN SEARCH OF A HOME
CALLED EARTH
<font color=#38B0DE>Battlestar Galactica
Season 4 Episode 5</font>
Heavy raider's docked at the aft airlock.
The animal part that controls it looks dead.
We only found the one Leoben aboard.
Starbuck's still taking one hell of a chance.
If he wanted to kill us,
we'd all be dead by now.
Just means he wants something else.
Kara.
Thank you for this.
We were praying for a miracle.
It wasn't a miracle.
It's like I knew you were out there.
I'm not picking up any gamma emissions, sir.
Raider's packing conventional weaponry only.
No nukes.
All right.
Keep checking for tracking devices.
Anything that might give up our position.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm sorry.
The difference between the way
you were on New Caprica
- and now is--
- I'm the same person.
I have eyes. I can see.
God has taken your hand and purged
you of the questions, the doubt.
Your journey can finally begin.
But there isn't much time.
The others, the ones I left behind,
they need your help.
But not as much as you need theirs.
Why?
Your crew.
They don't trust you.
I need you to tell me why you're here...
Captain, we should move the prisoner.
A blue planet...
- surrounded by clouds.
- You okay?
Stop!
The hybrid.
When she first described it to me,
how beautiful it was, I cried.
You need to go to her, Kara.
The hybrid, she'll tell you things.
Amazing things.
We're done here.
Get him out of here.
Wait!
Take him to my quarters.
Just do it!
It may never make any sense.
Hangar deck crew tells me you've
been obsessing over this place.
Going over the logs.
Replaying the accident again and again.
Accident.
What is it?
I spoke to Cottle.
Cally was on moxopan and cosapine.
Antidepressants.
How did she go from
antidepressants to suicide?
Well, she was...
emotionally disturbed.
She would've left me.
She never would've left Nicky behind.
So.
What do you think then?
Someone killed her?
Galen, you have to let it go.
No, I gotta figure out what happened.
What if she knew?
How would she have known?
Maybe she sensed it.
I mean, she was your wife.
You've been different since the nebula.
Maybe she was afraid of you.
Maybe it was God's will.
We don't know why these things happen.
But God does.
And he has plan for us.
For whatever reason, her death, our awakening,
you gotta trust that it's all for the best.
Why are you here?
Because we are in this together.
And I am here for you, Galen.
I know exactly where you are right now.
I have been there.
Until Gaius helped me realize that.
What?
Whatever has gone on before, whatever
I have done, it doesn't matter.
We can still change.
You spend way too much time with Baltar.
So I guess I missed all the excitement, huh?
So what's the deal?
This Leoben, has he said anything?
Don't know.
Starbuck ordered the guards
to wait outside, lose the cuffs.
Said she didn't want to be disturbed.
Guess I'll talk to her.
Yeah, why don't you do that?
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Get the hell away from her.
Sam--Sam, stop it!
What is wrong with you, Kara?
I can see why she's so fond of you.
Just leave him alone.
You know--you know what we have to do.
Just remember there isn't much time.
Get him the frak out of here!
Cuff him and lock him in storage!
What is going on with you?
Kara!
He can help us.
The Cylons, they understand about Earth.
And you believe him?
After everything he's done to you?
Kara, he kept you locked up
for months on New Caprica.
The frakkin' mind games.
I swear to gods this is not a dream.
It's real.
I'm glad you're here.
You and Kara, did you get things worked out?
Because you should.
You weren't meant to be enemies.
No.
That'd be you and me.
What do you want from Kara?
The same thing I've always wanted.
For her to understand her destiny.
That's not good enough.
It's good enough for her.
What is the most basic article of faith?
That this is not all that we are.
C-bucks rule.
What did you just say?
Forward guard, right?
I saw a couple of games.
You were good.
Yet after all the celebrity
and acclaim, what were you?
Just another face selling magazines.
Another piece of scoreboard trivia, and you
always knew you were destined for more.
You were just waiting for your
singular moment of clarity.
Well, maybe I just found it.
You kill me, Kara's dream dies with me.
I don't think so.
I think you download into another
Leoben body and you spew more lies.
No one's coming back.
We were lured out of resurrection range.
Ship was attacked.
We survived.
The baseship was damaged.
We were set adrift.
What are you talking about?
Who attacked you?
War has broken out between the Cylons.
Battle lines have been drawn
between those who embrace their
nature and those who fear it.
Good.
You can blow yourselves
to hell for all I care.
That's one way, that's one way.
There's another.
An alliance.
Allow our paths to converge.
You save us from our savage brothers.
And our old one, the hybrid,
will show Kara the righteous path.
And together, they'll lead us
to the promised land.
Together, we will find Earth.
He said his baseship was attacked;
that they were ambushed by their own kind.
So now the Cylons want us to rescue them.
That's novel.
Well, he's proposing an alliance
between us and his damaged baseship.
How's that supposed to work?
Yeah, are supposed to leave
them piggyback on our nav
and FTL systems and help
them jump out of harm's way?
They'll join forces with the fleet.
Right.
If it's true.
Frak.
Are you actually thinking about doing this?
XO, listen.
Bringing Leoben on board,
that was questionable at best.
But jumping back to his baseship?
It's suicide.
Nothing's been decided.
And will you trust Starbuck to
make the right decision?
Because she's out of control.
Whoa, what are you saying?
We are running on fumes, Anders.
In two days we are gonna be overdue
for our rendezvous with the fleet.
We gotta do something before
she takes us all down with her.
Are you talking mutiny?
'Cause that's sure what it sounds like.
You want to tear this ship apart,
then keep riling up the crew
making your crazy Starbuck cracks.
Otherwise, I suggest you both shut the frak up.
Starbuck is leading us into a trap.
Cylons are gonna capture the freighter.
They're gonna have nav data
straight back to the fleet.
Then we better keep that from happening.
Order the cap back and lock down the ship.
As soon we can work through the jump
coordinates from Leoben's raider, we go.
It's a chance to find Earth!
I intend to take it.
Not that I particularly care,
but since I haven't been
arrested recently or beaten up,
can I...can I surmise that the president
has not been apprised of my pirate broadcasts?
Actually, I told her all about them.
I even suggested she speak to the admiral.
Really.
I guess you'll have to do something about that.
Or not.
Even Roslin and Adama must realize the
movement's taken on a life of its own.
It's gonna take them more than
bashing in a few heads to stop this.
The truth is you're not worth another
confrontation in the quorum.
You may be drawing more bodies to your
crusade, but they're from the fringes.
No one of consequence.
Get some clothes on.
They're waiting for you.
Think we have enough?
It doesn't matter.
They'd not coming to be fed.
They're coming to hear Dr. Baltar's word,
and learn from it, just like we did.
The past is written.
Impossible to change.
Why are so many of us living in the past?
Living with the shame of what we have done.
When we could live in awe of what we might do.
At we might do.
What will we do?
Spiral endlessly through the heavens until
humanity itself comes to a close?
Or do we look inward...
and find that strength within?
Can you believe these people
are buying into Baltar's crap?
We need to talk.
I don't have anything to say to you.
Well, then you can listen.
Come with me.
I've been cutting you some slack
because of Cally, but that's over.
You gotta pull yourself together now.
Suck it up.
Just like you, huh?
Now what is that supposed to mean?
I hear you've been spending some
time in the lockup with the Six.
Remember when this all started?
You said nothing would change you
from the man you want to be.
Well, how about it, Colonel?
You still the same old Saul Tigh?
Anything I've done I can live with.
Well, that's the difference
between you and me.
I can't.
Tory's got in her head that we can be
the salvation of the human race.
All I know is if there is a God,
he's laughing his ass off.
EVA is almost complete, captain.
Demetrius, Mathias.
I've finished inspection of the aft section.
She's a big sucker.
Okay, wrap it up, sarge.
Get back to nest asap.
Roger that, Athena.
I was getting bored with the view anyhow.
Hold up.
Got a leak.
Some kind of gas venting
through a crack in the hull.
Something's happening.
Mathias, report.
Mathias, report!
What are you all doing here?
The reason that we are all here
is 'cause the old ways have failed us.
It doesn't matter if you're
a believer or a nonbeliever.
It certainly makes no difference to me.
You are all welcome.
Mr. Tyrol.
Mr. Tyrol.
I know that we have had our differences,
but I am begging you right
now to set those aside.
Come down here and take my hand.
If not for yourself, then for your wife.
For Cally.
She would've wanted this.
Cally wasn't like me.
She forgave you for New Caprica.
Even read your bogus manifesto,
but not me.
You may have your sheep fooled.
They may be buying into your
message of forgiveness.
But let me tell you:
There are some sins that even your
imaginary god can never forgive.
I have not been talking about an imaginary god.
I am asking you to take my hand.
Take my hand, Mr. Tyrol.
For Cally.
It's what she would've wanted.
Get off of him!
Leave him!
Leave him!
You didn't know her!
I heard an explosion.
Are you all right?
What'd you do?
Blow the Tylium stores?
That's the Kara I used to know.
The raider's in pieces,
you mother-frakker!
Sergeant Mathias is dead.
Not that you give a damn!
You can't think that
I had anything to do with that.
I wasn't even on the deck.
I was too busy believing you
instead of watching out for my crew.
My ship was under fire.
The reactor could've been damaged.
It was a setup.
Say it!
Hit me, hit me again.
You used me to get close to the ship.
How many times did you
kill me on New Caprica?
Don't stop now.
- Frak you!
- Go on, do it.
I won't come back this time, I promise.
Resurrection ship's well out of range.
Go on, do it.
Do it!
It doesn't help.
Does it?
Nothing feels quite like it did before.
Does it?
What are you doing to me?
All of your life...
you forced back the truth by
lashing out at everyone around you.
Anesthetizing yourself with
ambrosia and empty affairs.
But you've lost the taste for those petty things.
I'm the same person.
No, there's a void,
an emptiness that can only be filled by
taking the next step on your journey.
What happened to me the two months I was missing?
I don't know.
The mandala, the paintings, my mother.
It had to mean something.
You have to make peace with your past.
Why?
Because that part of you is gone.
I told you when I first came aboard
this ship that you had changed.
I look at you now,
I don't see Kara Thrace.
I see.
an angel blazing with the light of God.
An angel eager to lead her people home.
This is bad.
This is really bad.
She can't explain this one away.
So you think she's a Cylon now?
Starbuck's racked up more kills
than any pilot in the fleet.
Yeah, Starbuck maybe.
Okay, but who the hell knows who
got off that viper two months ago?
I'm not really very good at any of this.
We've all come to remember
Sergeant Erin mathias.
To grieve for our loss.
To honor her.
Mathias is dead because of me.
We've all heard the words, the prayers,
but I don't know what any of it means anymore.
We want to believe that she died for something.
But in this war, people die and it is just stupid.
It's an accident.
There's no nobility to it.
There's nothing we can grab onto
that's gonna make it any easier.
They're just gone.
I have to live with that.
You know, I know...
that this has been a difficult mission.
And...
maybe I haven't...
Captain, we've downloaded the
rendezvous coordinates to the FTL.
We're ready to jump back to
the fleet on your order.
We're not going back to the fleet.
What the hell are you talking about?
We came out here to complete a mission.
That baseship has something
to do with it, I know it.
Captain Agathon.
Lock down the ship.
Prepare to jump.
No, you know what?
Frak her and frak her little pet Cylon, okay?
- Pike!
- This baseship was never part of the mission.
Okay, one of us is dead now.
One of us is dead,
and if we don't leave right now
we are all going to die, all right?
Let it go-- just let it go, Pike!
- Everybody stand down!
- If I don't do anything, we're all gonna die!
- Get out of my way.
- You have your orders, Pike.
Now back off.
You better choose which
side you're on, captain.
Walk away.
Walk away and this doesn't go any further!
Huh, you'd be the one to protect
that Cylon thing, right--unh!
Gaius, I just don't understand what
you're trying to accomplish.
- I mean, this man is psychotic.
- My message is for everyone.
Especially for the ones who don't want to listen.
- I just don't think it's safe.
- Five minutes, that's all.
Mr. Tyrol.
- Gaius, I really don't think--
- There's nothing to be afraid of.
Be careful.
Look, uh, chief, I...
I'm here to ask for your forgiveness.
About my presumption earlier.
You were right, you know.
I hardly knew your wife.
I'm sorry.
Would you mind if I...
just, um...
I know it's hard to...
make sense of things sometimes.
In my own life...
In my own life, I joined the fleet as a scientist,
as a skeptic, as supposedly a man of reason.
Only to have fate turn that all on its head,
but I understand now that
there is a purpose to it.
We change.
We evolve.
Maybe we even learn something along the way.
I have committed...
unconscionable crimes...
and I have been offered one
last chance at redemption.
Because I chose to accept my fate,
not fight it anymore.
I'm so sorry for your loss, chief.
She was a very beautiful woman, your wife.
I'm also told quite spiritual.
You know, I don't expect you
to believe me, but...
I would very much like to have known her better.
Thank you.
Action stations, action stations.
Set Condition One throughout the ship.
Are you really gonna do this?
I don't have any choice.
Yes, you do.
FTL's spooled, captain.
Good.
Set the clock.
Captain.
Captain, I'm asking you to reconsider.
There's not enough time.
We don't go now, we lose our shot.
That's assuming we believe the Cylon.
That's assuming we believe that
Leoben's coordinates are right.
We don't jump into a nest of baseships
or the middle of a star...
Galactica's standing orders are clear.
If we miss the rendezvous,
Adama will assume we're dead or captured.
They will leave us.
No. Not Adama.
Listen to me, we can jump back to Galactica.
Okay, if the admiral's for it, we can re-supply,
send out an armed patrol.
Do not do this, Helo.
I can't allow you to risk
the lives of this ship's crew.
When the admiral put me in command,
he told me to trust my instincts.
Find the next marker, see if it checks out.
Lead the people from the fleet home.
That is what I intend to do.
Now prepare to jump!
I'm sorry, sir, but I cannot obey that order.
Then you are relieved, captain.
Mr. Gaeta, you are now the new XO.
Prepare to jump on my mark.
No, sir.
Okay, everybody needs to think about
what they're doing here.
They have thought about it, Sam.
They all have.
It's a mutiny.
Captain Thrace, as XO of the Demetrius,
and acting under article ten of
the colonial military code,
I'm hereby relieving you of command.

LE DERNIER SERA RÉVÉLÉ
<i>Précédemment dans</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
Madame la Présidente,
prenez-vous de nouveau du Chamalla ?
Je reprends du Chamalla
parce que mon cancer est revenu.
Je me souviens
d'une étoile triple qui clignote,
d'une géante gazeuse avec des anneaux
et d'une comète.
Du neuf, Felix ?
Demi-tour, retour au secteur 7.
- C'est la dixième correction de cap.
- Putain.
Ils vont attaquer.
Préviens les autres !
On doit sauter immédiatement.
Souviens-toi,
c'est eux qui ont commencé.
Mais on les tue.
On les tue pour de bon.
Contact dradis.
J'ai un visuel. Raider lourd cylon.
<i>Kara, je suis seul.
Ce n'est pas une attaque.</i>
- <i>Je savais que je te trouverais.</i>
- Leoben.
<i>Je suis ici pour toi,</i>
<i>pour proposer une trêve
entre humains et Cylons.</i>
<i>Et une chance pour toi
de finir ton voyage.</i>
L'Hybride.
Tu dois la rencontrer, Kara.
Elle te dira comment trouver la Terre.
C'est fini. Sortez-le d'ici.
Ce vaisseau fait pas
partie de la mission.
Si on part pas de suite,
on va tous y passer.
Nous sommes prêts à rejoindre la flotte.
- On rejoint pas la flotte.
- C'est quoi ces conneries ?
On est en mission.
Ce vaisseau-mère y est lié, je le sais.
Capitaine Thrace,
en tant que XO du Demetrius,
je vous relève de votre commandement.
Fils de pute.
Je le ferai moi-même.
- Vous foutez quoi ?
- Recule !
Envoyez les marines ici.
Dites-leur que le capitaine Thrace
est en état d'arrestation.
Tu te trompes, Helo.
T'es à côté de la plaque.
Nous ramenons Leoben
et sa proposition à la flotte.
L'Amiral décidera.
Tu gâches notre dernière chance
de trouver la Terre.
Et vous serez coupables de mutinerie.
Que va décider l'Amiral à votre sujet ?
À lui de voir.
M. Gaeta, réinitialisez le FTL
pour le 1er saut vers la flotte.
Tout de suite, Colonel.
- On devrait buter ta gueule de Cylon.
- Je suis pas une Cylon.
Gaeta, arrêtez !
Gaeta, annulez le saut !
J'ai dit, annulez le saut !
Putain.
Vous voulez savoir qui est le patron,
qui décide ?
- Vous voulez le savoir ?
- Sam !
C'est le capitaine Thrace, bordel !
Lâchez-la !
- Baissez votre arme, Sergent !
- Docteur !
Baissez votre arme ! C'est un ordre !
Seelix, baisse ton arme !
Putain de merde !
- Passez-moi un médikit !
- M'approche pas !
Putain !
Putain de merde !
Coagulants ! Ça va faire mal.
Prêt ? On y va.
Me touche pas, sale pute...
Morphine.
Il faut le mettre sur une couchette.
- Marines, par ici !
- Oui, Monsieur.
- Doucement.
- Faites gaffe !
Écoute-moi. Kara, c'était...
Tu vas nous donner des ordres
en nous menaçant ?
Tu as raison, Helo.
J'aurais pas dû donner l'ordre
de sauter au vaisseau-mère.
Ce serait risquer trop de vies
pour une intuition.
- Le Demetrius rejoint la flotte ?
- Avec un Raptor en moins.
J'emmène Leoben sur le vaisseau-mère
pour vérifier son histoire.
- T'es folle ? Seule avec lui ?
- Elle sera pas toute seule.
Je l'accompagne.
C'est de la folie,
mais j'ai besoin de toi.
- Quoi ?
- Quelqu'un doit connaître leur langue.
Si c'est un piège, je veux le savoir.
Super, que la Cylon se casse.
C'est bon.
Je vais le faire.
Ton Raptor n'a pas assez de carburant
pour rejoindre le Galactica.
Le vaisseau-mère, si.
L'Amiral nous a envoyés ici
pour accomplir une mission.
Pas pour moi,
mais pour les gens de la flotte.
Si j'ai raison,
la récompense sera la Terre.
Lieutenant Costanza,
quand devons-nous partir au plus tard
pour notre rendez-vous avec la flotte ?
La fenêtre se ferme dans 15 h et 7 min.
Et encore, ce sera limite.
Réglez le compte à rebours
à 15 heures et 7 minutes.
Nous vous attendrons ici
jusqu'à la dernière seconde.

Je ne parle pas que du Quorum, Tory.
Il y a quelques mois,

Non, j'ai dit que je venais.
Tu as ma parole.
C'est comme un come-back, pour toi.
Les autres Huit parlent
tout le temps de toi.
Qu'il m'approche pas.
J'ai pas demandé de volontaires.
Si, vous l'avez fait, sur le Galactica.
Je m'en fous, de ce qu'ils pensent.
Vous assurez depuis le premier jour.
Vous pensez pouvoir trouver la Terre.
Je veux voir ça.
Vous avez 14 heures et 40 minutes.
- Bonne chance.
- Bien reçu.
Tu la sens ?
Cette attente.
Le plan de Dieu va être révélé.
Vaudrait mieux pour toi.
Trois, deux, un,
saut.
Contacts multiples
sur tous les quadrants.
On dirait qu'on a trouvé
ce qu'il reste d'eux.
Comment ça va, Felix ?
Au mieux de ma forme.
Ces enculés veulent pas
me redonner de morphine.
La peur que je fasse une overdose.
Ouais, je sais.
Tu peux me faire une promesse ?
Ce que tu veux.
Laisse pas Cottle me couper la jambe.
- Ça va aller.
- Me prends pas pour un con.
Karl.
Je sais qu'à chaque minute qui passe,
y a plus de chances
qu'il doive le faire.
Je t'en prie, promets-le-moi.
Felix,
tu sais que je partirai pas
avant la fin du compte à rebours.
Bon, où est ce vaisseau ?
Je sais pas. S'il est toujours entier,
le dradis est trop saturé pour le voir.
Et fais attention,
y a des débris partout, par ici.
Il mentait pas, pour la guerre civile.
Ça y est.
C'est ici.
Je l'entends.
La Mélodie de l'univers
vibre en chacun de nous.
Peu l'entendent.
Kara est l'une d'entre eux.
Quel cap ?
Passe-moi les commandes.
Starbuck, tu sais où tu vas ?
La comète... La...
C'est le vaisseau ?
C'est ce que je devais voir.
En approche, à deux heures !
Elle se réveille.
Frak.
Kara. Non, non, doucement, Kara.
Tout le monde va bien. Ça va aller.
Non, touche pas.
Faut qu'elle prenne l'air.
M'approchez pas, putain !
Ils t'appellent Athena.
Tu portes même leur uniforme,
comme si tu étais des leurs.
Tu es la première à avoir dit non.
- "Non" à quoi ?
- Au plan.
Tu as rejoint les humains, eu un enfant.
Tu nous as montré qu'on peut
se libérer de notre programmation.
On voulait la même chose,
mais ça a été un désastre.
Les Six ont commis erreur sur erreur.
Il faut les arrêter
avant qu'elles nous fassent tous tuer.
Demande-lui.
Aide-nous.
Tu veux que je mène
une mutinerie contre les Six ?
On n'a pas le choix.
- Vous me dégoûtez.
- Pourquoi ?
Quand on choisit son camp, on s'y tient.
On retourne pas sa veste quand ça va mal
ou on n'arrive jamais à rien.
Ni amour, ni famille.
Pas de vie propre.
Maintenant, vous m'aidez
ou vous vous écartez de mon chemin.
<i>... car elle prendra votre main...</i>
<i>vous guidera de l'autre côté...</i>
... quand vous irez mieux.
Vous ne savez pas lire ?
Je n'irai pas mieux.
Prenez vos aiguilles,
vos thermomètres et vos cathéters
et collez-les-vous
là où le soleil ne brille pas.
<i>... mettant fin à cette aube à jamais.</i>
<i>Le pays inconnu...</i>
Bonjour.
Génial...
La Présidente, maintenant !
Elle m'a piquée 3 fois aujourd'hui.
Soyez heureuse
que ça soit pas un cathéter.
<i>Où nous serons baignés
par l'amour de Dieu.</i>
Tout ça...
juste pour...
me garder en vie quelques jours de plus.
C'est absurde.
Non, pas du tout.
Et je suis sûre que ça n'aide pas
d'écouter Gaius Baltar...
Non, n'y touchez pas !
Bordel, vous vous prenez pour qui ?
<i>Acceptez-le en vous...</i>
Laissez-moi tranquille !
<i>Il n'est question que d'amour,
pas d'une vie vertueuse.</i>
<i>Dieu n'a que faire
du nombre de nos bonnes actions.</i>
<i>C'est l'erreur que je trouve</i>
<i>que tant de pieux...</i>
L'Hybride voudra te voir, je le sais.
- On y va, alors.
- À quoi tu joues ?
Tu veux lui donner accès
au système nerveux central du vaisseau ?
- On avait pas un accord ?
- On en a parlé.
- Kara est la clé de notre salut.
- On est d'accord pour une alliance.
Si vous voulez une alliance,
je vois l'Hybride.
Leoben dit qu'elle peut m'aider
à trouver la Terre.
Y a pas d'autre moyen.
Nous avons été patients avec l'obsession
de ton modèle pour cette femme.
C'était une chose
de jouer sur New Caprica,
mais là, ça nous met tous en danger.
On a leur Raptor et leur FTL.
Pas besoin d'eux.
- Putain de toasters !
- Barolay, non.
Vous maîtriserez pas notre système
de saut, sans nous.
Pas avant l'arrivée des autres cylons.
Et si on y arrive à temps,
on continue à fuir ? Jusqu'à manquer
de carburant, de bouffe, de munitions ?
Que les forces de Cavil
nous retrouvent ?
Que ça te plaise ou non,
on doit oeuvrer avec les Coloniaux.
Pour ça, Kara doit voir l'Hybride.
Ou vous pouvez crever.
On n'a pas le choix.
Mais d'abord, on fait ça.
OK, on peut le faire.
On peut faire sauter leur vaisseau
en asservissant ses commandes
- au générateur d'inversion du Raptor.
- Alors, vas-y.
Leur hybride a été endommagée
durant l'attaque, il faut la débrancher
et sauter depuis le Raptor.
Débrancher l'Hybride ?
Certainement pas.
On l'a jamais fait
sur un vaisseau opérationnel.
Ça pourrait l'aveugler, voire la tuer.
Si on le fait pas avant l'arrivée
des autres, on est morts.
Allez-y, Lieutenant.
Barolay,
arrache les connecteurs des bus
et dénude les câbles.
Ça marche, Lieutenant.
Et, Six, j'ai besoin
de certaines données tout de suite.
Mode simple, 1310,
ou ça va détruire notre système.
L'interface est en route.
Conduisez-moi à l'Hybride.
Anders, viens avec moi.
Mieux vaut que je reste.
Je connais mieux
le système du Raptor qu'eux.
- Qu'est-ce que tu regardes ?
- Je te connais.
Tu étais sur New Caprica.
Tu étais dans la résistance.
Tu m'as tuée.
Tu m'as regardée me noyer,
quand je me débattais comme un insecte.
Je le referais volontiers.
Ça va.
Barolay ?
Tu l'as tuée.
Tu l'as tuée, putain !
Tu veux connaître la mort ?
T'es rien !
- Putain de machine !
- Baisse ton arme !
- Sam, stop !
- Tu veux que je fasse quoi, Kara ?
Tu veux que j'oublie pour Barolay ?
Que j'oublie pour New Caprica ?
Putain, non ! Elle a tué Barolay !
Sam ! Baisse ton arme.
- Baisse-la.
- Réfléchis.
Sam...
T'as aucune idée de ce qui est en jeu.
Regarde-moi.
Baisse-la.
Ils ont tué l'un des nôtres
et tu vas laisser filer ?
Elle a raison.
Tu ne peux laisser passer ça.
Si tu veux pas le faire, je le ferai.
Baissez votre arme, Soldat.
Je dois voir l'Hybride.
Pourquoi, ma soeur ?
Je n'ai pas pu oublier.
- Sur New Caprica...
- C'était elle ?
Je ne lui avais jamais rien fait.
On travaillait à l'usine de traitement
des eaux et elle a...
Je sais, je m'en souviens.
Après ton téléchargement,
on a essayé de surmonter ça.
Comment peut-on surmonter
quelque chose comme ça ?
Je n'oublierai jamais son regard
alors que je tentais de crier.
Elle m'a...
Elle m'a bâillonnée avec du scotch
- et elle m'a poussée dans la fosse.
- Ferme ta sale gueule.
Je vois encore son visage
quand j'essaie de dormir.
On essayait d'aider ces gens.
Je sais.
Je sais, j'aimerais
pouvoir y faire quelque chose.
Je suis contente que ça soit toi.
Putain de merde !
Pas de vaisseau de résurrection.
Tu comprends ?
Elle est aussi morte que ton amie.
C'est assez de justice humaine
pour vous ?
Oeil pour oeil ?
Madame la Présidente.
Je voulais m'excuser
pour tout à l'heure.
J'ai des bons et des mauvais moments.
Et c'était lequel ?
Approchez. J'ai quelque chose pour vous.
- Pour moi ?
- Oui, entrez.
Venez.
Vous pouvez le sortir ?
Il est dans le premier tiroir. Ici.
C'est ça, oui.
C'est pour moi ?
J'espère que c'est pas trop clinquant.
C'est très beau.
Merci, c'est beau.
C'est une femme sur l'Aurora
qui les fait, Leslie Starus.
Elle en fait de toutes sortes,
si vous voulez aller voir.
Je pense que celui-ci
est parfait.
Vous espérez quelle couleur ?
Quand ils vont repousser ?
Bien...
Je pensais à bleu.
Un joli bleu roi.
Nouvelle allure.
Mes cheveux étaient...
Maintenant, touchez-les.
Touchez-les.
Ça va empirer.
Préparez-vous-y.
<i>Car il nous prendra la main</i>
<i>et nous guidera
sur l'autre berge de la rivière.</i>
Toutes ces choses d'un coup
et plus encore.
Non pas qu'il souhaite le mal,
mais parce qu'il aime changer
constamment les vibrations violentes...
Alors, les vierges
se réjouiront en dansant.
Intégrité structurelle du noeud 7
rétablie.
Repressurisation.
Les enfants de celui qui renaît

Les intrus fourmillaient

Pour ce que ça vaut, j'ai voté
pour vous aux dernières élections.
Et je n'aime pas la manière dont Baltar
parle de vous.
- Mais je ne l'écoute pas pour ça.
- Alors pourquoi ?
J'ai eu une expérience
qui a bouleversé mes préjugés.
Quel genre d'expérience ?
C'était la nuit après que Cottle
m'ait annoncé
que mon cancer avait évolué et
que je ne quitterai jamais cet endroit.
J'étais sur un ferry
qui traversait un fleuve,
et alors que nous approchions
de l'autre côté,
j'ai vu
toutes ces personnes sur la rive.
Nous nous sommes rapprochés et
je les ai reconnus.
Mes parents.
Ma soeur Kathy,
qui est morte quand j'avais 12 ans.
Mon mari, mes filles.
J'avais peur
pendant un instant.
Que se passait-il ?
Et après, je l'ai sentie.
Cette...
présence...
qui flottait tout autour de moi.
Chaude,
aimante, et...
Elle m'a dit...
"N'aie pas peur, Emily.
"Je suis avec toi.
"Tiens ma main
et nous traverserons ensemble."
Avec notre traitement, il est fréquent
de faire ce type de rêves.
Non.
J'y étais.
J'ai senti...
la brise fraîche venant de l'eau,
les embruns venant de la proue.
Il a dû découvrir quelque chose
par hasard.
Il parle de la rivière qui sépare
notre monde du suivant.
Qu'il y a, dans cette existence,
des choses invisibles à l'oeil nu.
Il y a un pouvoir
qui est incompréhensible pour nous.
Alors, les vierges
se réjouiront en dansant.
Intégrité structurelle du noeud 7
rétablie.
Repressurisation.
Les enfants de celui qui renaît
trouveront leur propre pays.
Fin de ligne.
Redémarrage.
Défaut du mode de traçage

Recharger les compresseurs.
Augmenter le débit de 50 %.
Supposer l'allongement

menant à une perte d'information.
Défaut de synchronisation du FTL

- Aucune cérémonie n'est utile...
- Je comprends pas.
La force centrifuge réagit
au cadre tournant de référence.
Le soldat de bois obstiné
devient malléable.
- La ville dévore la campagne...
- Tu ne peux pas la brusquer.
Tu dois t'imprégner de ses mots.
Les laisser caresser
ton esprit d'association.
N'espère pas que le destin de deux
grandes races te soit livré facilement.
Supposer l'allongement de la longueur
des photons dans l'air est constant.
Les intrus fourmillaient
comme une flamme, comme une tornade.
L'espoir s'élance pour tuer
les meilleurs sur nos fuselages.
Toutes ces choses en même temps et plus.
Non pas qu'ils souhaitent le mal,
mais parce qu'il aime changer
constamment les vibrations violentes...
Nous sommes prêts...
On la débranche et on part
ou on sera en retard.
- Redémarrage.
- Des résultats, Capitaine ?
Rien, putain.
Mais tu es une étincelle du feu divin.
Mise à jour du noyau effectuée.
Et merde ! Débranchez ce truc,

trouveront leur propre pays.
Fin de ligne.
Stop !
Athena !
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Que voulez-vous de moi ?
S'il vous plaît,
j'ai besoin de vous.
Ainsi faut-il que ça arrive.
Le chef mourant
connaîtra la vérité de l'opéra.
Le Trois manquant vous donnera les Cinq
qui sont venus du foyer de la 13e.
Tu es le messager de la mort,
Kara Thrace.
Tu les mèneras tous à leur fin.
Fin de ligne.
Mais ce dieu
dont Baltar parle,
c'est le dieu des Cylons.
Vous le savez bien, ça, non ?
S'il est le seul vrai Dieu,
il nous appartient à tous.
Sinon,
il ne serait pas vraiment un dieu, non ?
Tout à fait, ce n'est pas un vrai dieu.
C'est une chimère.
Laura...
Et les Seigneurs de Kobol existent.
Siégeant au sommet d'une montagne
métaphysique dans des habits ridicules.
Zeus sortant les destins
d'une urne...
comme des tickets de loterie.
"Tu travailleras dans une raffinerie.
Tu seras amiral.
"Ta famille sera
"annihilée dans une attaque
sur les Colonies,
"mais tu survivras 3 ans de plus dans
une cabine minable d'un transporteur
"jusqu'à ce que ton corps
se dévore lui-même de l'intérieur."
C'est ça, les dieux que vous vénérez ?
Capricieux, vindicatifs.
Il ne faut pas prendre ça
au pied de la lettre.
Ce sont des métaphores, Emily.
Je n'ai pas besoin de métaphores.
J'ai besoin de réponses.
Vous ressemblez à ma mère, elle
n'aimait pas les métaphores non plus.
Elle était convaincue
qu'Aphrodite en personne
l'enlèverait à sa mort, elle y croyait.
Même après que le Doloxan
et que les radiations
aient échoué à vaincre son cancer.
Elle était enseignante. Elle était...
C'était quelque chose à voir...
Comme elle tenait sa classe...
Et ses élèves...
Ses élèves l'aimaient. Ils...
Ils seraient morts pour elle.
Et quand vous voyez cette femme qui
avait l'air tellement...
éternelle, elle...
s'est détruite...
et je me retrouve...
à lui changer ses couches,
car elle ne pouvait même plus...
À sa mort,
il n'y a pas eu de Champs Élysées
s'étendant devant elle.
Il y avait ces...
sombres...
et noirs abysses.
Et elle n'était que terrifiée.
Elle avait si peur.
Je suis désolée.
Laura.
Laura.
C'est vous qui étiez terrifiée.
Il n'y a que vous qui ayez vu le noir.
Vous ne pouvez pas
savoir ce que votre mère a vécu.
Vous... Vous cherchez encore.
Docteur Cottle ! Docteur !
- Faites quelque chose !
- Donnez-moi vite de la morphine.
Ça va aller.
Tout va bien.
Tout ce qu'on peut faire pour elle,
maintenant, c'est...
d'essayer de la mettre à l'aise.
- C'est tout ?
- Je suis désolé, c'est tout.
D'accord.
On dirait qu'elle ne nous voit plus.
Elle voit au-delà de nous.
J'ai vu ce regard plein de fois,
mais jamais dans les yeux d'un Cylon.
Athena...
Tu avais raison.
Pardonne-moi.
Tout va bien.
Je suis avec toi.
Elle nous guidera jusqu'au bout.
On va maintenant savoir
ce qui s'est passé dans l'opéra.
- La maison de la 13e.
- Quoi ?
L'Hybride a dit,
"Le Trois manquant vous donnera les Cinq
"qui viennent du foyer de la 13e."
Le foyer de la 13e tribu d'humains...
Et les Cinq...
sont vos cinq modèles de Cylons.
Et s'ils viennent
du foyer de la 13e tribu,
ils savent comment y retourner.
Ils savent comment aller sur Terre.
Et le Trois manquant
est le modèle archivé
- pour avoir vu le visage des Cinq.
- D'Anna.
Elle peut les reconnaître.
Allons-y. Le Demetrius nous attend.
Nous y sommes.
Mère.
Vous allez bien.
Je ne suis pas prête.
<i>Vous n'avez plus
à avoir peur de l'inconnu.</i>
<i>Car il prendra votre main</i>
<i>et vous mènera
à l'autre côté de la rivière.</i>
<i>Quelle est cette rivière dont je parle ?</i>
<i>Je parle de la rivière
qui sépare ce monde du suivant.</i>
<i>La réalité ne se résume pas</i>
<i>aux seules choses
que nous pouvons toucher,</i>
<i>goûter,</i>
<i>ou même voir à l'oeil nu.</i>
<i>Il y a un autre royaume.</i>
Tous à vos postes.
Préparez le vaisseau à sauter.
Tous à vos postes.
Préparez le vaisseau à sauter.
Allez, allez.

Quatre... Trois...
Contact dradis !
Vaisseau-mère cylon.
Juste au-dessus.
Stoppez le compte à rebours !
Le vaisseau-mère
envoie une identification coloniale.
J'ai un signal audio,
mais il est très faible.
Haut-parleurs !
<i>Demetrius, ici Athena.
Demetrius, ici Athena.</i>
Dieux que c'est bon d'entendre ta voix.
Bien reçu, Helo.
Le vaisseau-mère est à nous.
Mission accomplie.
Alors on rentre à la maison.
J'ai besoin de te parler.
- Bien sûr, entre.
- Merci.
- Tu veux un verre d'eau ?
- Oui.
Tu crois vraiment qu'il y a
quelque chose dans ce fumier
que Baltar répand ?
Je ne sais pas.
Quelque chose se passe et
je n'y comprends rien, Bill.
Que vous ayez fait le même rêve,
signifie que...
Quoi ?
Dis-le-moi. Que se passe-t-il ?
Kara revient d'entre les morts.
Je la laisse partir, chasser sa vision
de la Terre.
Elle est en retard.
Lee
a rendu son insigne.
Et Helo, Athena, Gaeta.
Est-ce que je reverrai tous ces gamins ?
Bill...
Regarde-moi.
Je suis là.
Juste là.
On va la trouver.
La Terre ?
Ensemble.
Je voyais ça comme une utopie.
Je m'en servais comme une carotte
pour la flotte.
Qu'est-ce qui t'a fait changer ?
Toi.
Tu m'as fait croire.

<i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
Madame President,
are you taking Chamalla again?
I am taking Chamalla again
because my cancer has returned.
I remember a flashing triple star,
a giant gas planet with rings,
and a comet.
What's the latest, Felix?
She's reversing course.
Returning to sector seven.
- That is the tenth course correction.
- Frak me.
They're going to attack.
Alert the others.
We need to jump now.
Just remember,
- <i>they </i>started it.
- But we're killing them.
We are truly killing them.
Dradis contact.
I've got visual. Cylon heavy Raider.
<i>Kara, I'm alone. This is not an attack.</i>
- <i>I knew I'd find you.</i>
- Leoben.
<i>I'm here for you.</i>
<i>To offer a truce between human and Cylon</i>
<i>and a chance for you
to complete your journey.</i>
The Hybrid.
You need to go to her, Kara.
She'll tell you the way to get to Earth.
We're done here. Get him out of here.
This baseship was never
part of the mission.
If we don't leave right now,
we are all going to die.
We're ready to jump back on your order.
- We're not going back to the fleet.
- What are you talking about?
We came to complete a mission,
that baseship has
something to do with it.
Captain Thrace, as XO of the Demetrius,
I'm hereby relieving you of command.
You son of a bitch.
I'll do it myself.
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Stand down!
Order the marine guards
to the control room.
Tell them I'm placing
Captain Thrace under arrest.
You're wrong, Helo.
You're so godsdamn wrong.
Either way, we're taking Leoben
and his proposal back to the fleet.
The Admiral will sort it out.
You're throwing away
our last chance to find Earth.
And you'll be going back
to Galactica as mutineers.
How do you think
the Admiral's gonna sort through that?
That's up to him.
M. Gaeta, reset the FTL
for the first jump back to the fleet.
Right away, Sir.
- We should just airlock your Cylon ass.
- I am not a Cylon.
Gaeta, stop!
Gaeta, abort the jump!
I said, abort the jump!
Frak.
You want to know who's in charge?
Who's in command?
- You frakkin' want to know?!
- Sam!
It's Captain Thrace, Gods damn it!
Now let her go!
Sergeant, stand down.
- Stand down, Sergeant!
- Medic!
Stand down, Sergeant! That's an order!
Seelix, stand down! Stand down.
What the frak?
- I need a med kit!
- Stay away from me.
Frak!
What the frak?
All right, bloodstopper.
This is gonna hurt.
Ready, go.
Get off me, you frakkin' bitch...
Morpha.
We need to move him to a bunk.
- Marines, get over here!
- Yes, Sir.
- Easy.
- Careful!
Wait, listen. Kara, that was...
So now what?
Gonna give orders at gunpoint?
You're right, Helo.
I never should've ordered Demetrius
to jump to the baseship.
Too many lives to risk
on a gut instinct.
- So Demetrius goes back to the fleet.
- Missing a Raptor.
I'm gonna take Leoben to the baseship,
see if his story checks out.
Are you insane? The two of you alone?
She's not going alone.
I'm going with her.
This is crazy, but I need you.
What?
I need someone speaking their language.
If this is a trap,
I want to know about it.
Hell, yeah, let the Cylon go.
It's okay.
I'll do it.
Listen to me. Your Raptor doesn't have
enough fuel to get back to Galactica.
But the baseship does.
We were sent out here by the Admiral
to complete a mission.
Not for me,
but for the people of the fleet.
And if I'm right, the payoff is Earth.
Lieutenant Costanza,
what's the latest we can leave here
and still make the rendezvous
with the fleet?
Window closes
15 hours and seven minutes.
And that's cutting it really damn close.
Set the clock to 15 hours
and 7 minutes and start it.
We'll be waiting here
till the clock runs out.

So I guess just pack up
everything that's here.
Pack up all of these drafts.
I will have plenty of time on my hands
over the next couple of days,
so pack it up.
At least the worst is over.
2 more Doloxan treatments
and you will be over the hump.
And I'm gonna need you to...
Really keep an eye on things until then.
Don't worry.
I'll make sure our friend from Picon
sees the error of his ways.
I'm not just talking
about the Quorum, Tory.
There was a time a few months ago
when you seemed overwhelmed
by the stresses and the pressures
of this job.
But lately you've really stepped up.
And I'm gonna be demanding
even more of that from you
in the days to come, because...
I'm not quite sure
of what I'm doing right.
I'm sort of...
I'm just gonna need you
to keep a keen eye
on every single thing
that comes across this desk.
I appreciate your confidence,
Madame President.
Thank you. Let's go.
Just remember, if this is a trap,
you die first.
Preflight is complete.
I need to know.
Do I need to watch my back
with you on this?
No, I said I'd go.
You have my word.
Be like a homecoming for you.
The other Eights talk
about you all the time.
Keep him the frak away from me.
Barolay, I didn't ask for volunteers.
Yeah, you did, back on Galactica.
I don't give a frak what they think.
You've been kicking ass since day one.
You say you can find Earth.
I wanna be there when you do.
You have 14 hours and 40 minutes.
- Godspeed.
- Copy that.
Can you feel it?
The anticipation.
God's plan is about to be revealed.
You better hope so for your sake.
Three, two, one, jump.
Multiple contacts, all quadrants.
Looks like we found what's left of them.
How you doing, Felix?
Never better.
Those frakkers
won't give me any more morpha.
Afraid I'll OD or something.
Yeah, I know.
Will you promise me something?
Anything.
Don't let Cottle take my leg.
- You're gonna be all right.
- Don't frak with me.
Karl.
I know every minute that we stay here
means it's more likely
that he's gonna have to.
Please.
Okay, promise me.
Felix,
you know damn well
I won't leave until the clock runs out.
All right, where's the baseship?
Don't know. If it's still in one piece,
dradis is too cluttered to see it.
Watch yourselves. We've got ordinance
popping off all over the place.
Looks like he wasn't lying
about a civil war.
This is it.
This is the place.
I can hear it.
The unstruck music
vibrates in all of us.
Few can hear it.
Kara's one of the few.
Got a course for us?
Give me the ship.
Starbuck,
you have any idea where you're going?
The comet.
The...
It's the ship.
This is what I was meant to see.
Incoming, right, two high!
She's back.
Oh, frak.
Kara.
No, no. Take it easy, Kara.
Everybody made it okay.
You'll be fine.
No, don't touch it.
We need to get her out of here.
Get her some air.
Get the frak away from me!
They call you Athena now.
You even wear
their uniform like you're one of them.
You were the first to say no.
- No to what?
- The entire plan.
You joined the humans.
You had a child.
You showed us that we don't have
to be slaves to our programming.
We wanted the same thing,
but it turned out to be a disaster.
The Sixes have made one
mistake after another.
They have to be stopped
before they get the rest of us killed.
Ask.
You could help us.
You want me to lead
a mutiny against the Sixes.
It's the only way.
- You guys make me sick.
- Why?
Because you pick your side
and you stick.
You don't cut and run
when things get ugly.
Otherwise you'll never have anything.
No love, no family.
No life to call your own.
Now you guys can either help me
or get the hell out of my way.
<i>...'cause he will take your hand...</i>
<i>... guide you to the other side...</i>
When you're feeling a little better.
Can't you read a chart?
I'm not gonna feel better.
So take your needles
and your thermometers and your catheters
and stick 'em
where the sun doesn't shine.
<i>The undiscovered country...</i>
Hello.
Oh, great.
Now the President.
She stuck me three times today.
Be thankful
she hasn't put a catheter in you.
<i>Where we will bask
in the radiance of God's love.</i>
All this...
just to...
keep me alive for a few more days.
It's so pointless.
No, it's not pointless.
And I'm sure it isn't helping
listening to Gaius Baltar...
No, no, no, don't touch that!
Who the frak do you think you are?
<i>Accept him into your hearts...</i>
Leave me alone!
<i>It is all about love.</i>
<i>It's not about living a righteous life.</i>
<i>God doesn't really care
how many good deeds we've done.</i>
<i>This is the mistake that I find</i>
<i>that so many of the pious...</i>
The Hybrid will want to see you,
I know it.
- Let's go then.
- What are you doing?
You want to give her access to
the central nervous system of this ship?
- I thought we had a deal.
- We discussed this.
- Kara's the key to our salvation.
- We agreed on an alliance.
You want an alliance, I see the Hybrid.
Leoben claims it can help me find Earth.
There's no way around it.
We've tried to be patient about
your model's obsession with this woman.
Playing house with her
on New Caprica was one thing.
But this puts us all in Jeopardy.
We have their Raptor and their jump
drive. We don't need them.
- Frakkin' toaster...
- Barolay, don't.
You don't have time to figure out
our jump systems without our help.
Not before the other Cylons get back.
And if we do figure it out in time,
do we just keep running? How long before
we run out of fuel, food, ammunition?
How long before
Cavil's forces hunt us down?
Like it or not,
we have to work with the Colonials.
That means Kara sees the Hybrid.
Or you can kiss your asses good-bye.
Looks as if we have no choice.
But first, we do this.
Okay, we can do this.
We can give their ship jump
capability again by slaving its drives
- to our Raptor's spin sync generator.
- So just do it.
Their Hybrid was damaged in the attack,
so we're gonna have to pull her offline
and execute jumps from the Raptor.
Pull the Hybrid offline?
Absolutely not.
It's never been done
on an operational ship.
It would be like blinding her.
It might kill her.
If we don't do this before the other
Cylons come back, we're all dead anyway.
Make it happen, Lt.
Barolay,
yank the connectors from the bus
and strip the cables out of them.
You got it, Lieutenant.
And, Six, I'm gonna need
some data cabling right away.
Single mode, 1310, otherwise
you'll blow our system to shreds.
We started the interface.
Take me to this Hybrid.
Anders, you're on me.
Might be better if I stay here.
I know more about
the Raptor's system than they do.
- What the hell are you looking at?
- I know you.
You were on New Caprica.
You were part of the resistance.
You killed me.
Watched me drown, kicking and thrashing
like I was some kind of an insect.
Be happy to put you down again.
I'm okay.
Barolay?
Jean.
Jean!
You killed her.
You frakkin' killed her!
You want to know what
it feels like to die? You're nothing!
You're a frakkin' machine!
Sam, put the gun down now!
- Sam, stop!
- What do you want me to do, Kara?
You want me to forget about Barolay?
You want me to forget about New Caprica?
No frakkin' way!
She just killed Barolay!
Sam! Put the gun down.
- Put it down.
- Look into it.
Sam.
Sam,
you have no idea what's at stake here.
Look at me.
Put it down.
They killed one of us
and you're just ready to let it slide?
She's right.
You can't let this go, Kara.
If you don't want to do this, I will.
Put the gun down, soldier.
I need to see the Hybrid.
Why, sister?
I just couldn't let it go.
- On New Caprica...
- She was the one?
I never did anything to her.
We were working at the water
treatment plant and she just...
I know. I remember.
After you downloaded,
we tried to work through this.
How do you work
through something like that?
Never forget her expression
as I tried to scream.
Just...
Just slapped tape over my mouth
- and threw me in that septic tank.
- You shut your frakkin' mouth.
I still see her face
when I try and sleep.
We were trying to help those people.
I know.
I know.
I wish there was something I could do.
Then I'm glad it's you.
Gods damn it!
No resurrection ship.
You understand?
She's just as dead as your friend.
Is that enough human justice for you?
Blood for blood?
Madam President.
I wanted to apologize for before.
I have good moments and bad.
And that was which?
Come in here. I have something for you.
- For me?
- Yes, yes, come in.
Come in.
All right. Would you get it?
It's in the first drawer. Right here.
That's it, yes.
This is for me?
I hope it's not too gaudy.
This is beautiful.
Thank you. That's beautiful.
A woman on Aurora makes 'em.
Leslie Starus.
She makes all kinds
if you want to check it out.
Now, I think this one
will be just fine.
What color are you hoping for?
When it grows back in?
Well...
I was thinking maybe blue.
Nice royal blue.
Change of pace.
My hair used to be...
Now look at it. Feel it,
feel it.
It's gonna get a lot worse.
Be prepared for that.
<i>Because he will take our hands</i>
<i>and guide us
to the other side of the river.</i>
All these things at once and many more.
Not because it wishes harm,
but because it likes
violent vibrations to change constantly.
Then shall
the maidens rejoice at the dance.
Structural integrity
of node seven restored.
Repressurizing.
The children of the one reborn
shall find their own country.
The intruders swarmed like flame.
Like the whirlwind.
Hopes soaring to slaughter
all their best against our hulls.
I'm here. You wanted me here, so...
Replace internal control accumulators
4 through 19.
They'll start going ripe on us
pretty soon.
Compartmentalize integrity conflicts
with the obligation to provide access.
FTL sync fault uncorrected.
No ceremonies are necessary.
For what it's worth,
I voted for you in the last election.
And I don't like
how Baltar keeps ragging on you.
- But that is not why I listen to him.
- Why do you listen to him?
I had an experience that made me
rethink all my preconceptions.
What kind of experience?
It happened the night after Cottle
told me that
my cancer had spread to my liver
and I'd never be leaving this place.
I was on a ferry, crossing a river,
and as we were approaching
the other side,
I saw all these people
standing on the bank.
And we got closer, and
I recognized them.
My parents.
My sister Kathy, who died when I was 12.
My husband, my girls.
I was scared
for a moment.
You know, how is this happening?
But then I felt it.
This...
presence...
hovering all around me.
Warm,
loving, and...
It said...
"Don't be scared, Emily.
"I'm with you.
"Hold my hand
and we'll cross over together."
But a lot of people in our predicament
have dreams like that, Emily.
No.
I was there.
I felt...
The cool breeze coming from the water.
The spray from the bow.
Maybe he's stumbled onto something.
You know,
he talks about the river that separates
our world from the next.
That there's more to this existence
than we can see with our naked eye.
There's a power
that we can't begin to understand.
Then shall the maidens
rejoice at the dance.
Structural integrity of node seven
restored.
Repressurizing.
The children of the one reborn
shall find their own country.
End of line.
Reset.
Track mode monitor malfunction traced.
Recharge compressors.
Increase the output to 50%.
Assume the relaxation length
of photons...
Transfers contact is inevitable,
leading to information bleed.
FTL sync fault stands uncorrected.
- No ceremonies are necessary...
- I don't understand.
Centrifugal forces reacts
to the rotating frame of reference.
The obstinate toy soldier
becomes pliant.
- The city devours the land...
- You can't hurry her.
You have to absorb her words.
Allow them to caress
your associative mind.
Don't expect the fate of two great races
to be delivered easily.
Assume the relaxation length of photons
in the sample atmosphere is constant.
The intruders swarmed like flame.
Like the whirlwind.
Hopes soaring to slaughter
all their best against our hulls.
All these things at once and many more.
Not because it wishes harm,
but because it likes violent vibrations
to change constantly...
Hey, we're rigged and ready.
Time to pull her offline and get out
of here before we miss our rendezvous.
- Reset.
- Any luck, Captain?
Not a frakkin' thing.
But you are a spark of God's fire.
Core update complete.
Frak it! Unplug the damn thing.
Let's get the frak out of here.
Threat detection matrix enabled.
Dendritic response bypassed.
The received dose
is altered by the delayed gamma burst.
Going active.
Execute. The children of the one reborn
shall find their own country.
End of line.
Stop!
Athena!
What the hell happened?
What do you want from me?
Please,
I need you.
Thus will it come to pass.
The dying leader
will know the truth of the opera house.
The missing Three will give you the Five
who have come from the home of the 13th.
You are the harbinger of death,
Kara Thrace.
You will lead them all to their end.
End of line.
But this god
that Baltar refers to,
it is the Cylon god.
You know that, don't you?
If he's the one and true God,
he belongs to all of us.
Otherwise,
he's not much of a god, is he?
Exactly, he isn't much of a god.
He's a fantasy.
Oh, Laura.
And the Lords of Kobol are real.
Reigning from a metaphysical mountaintop
in those silly outfits.
Zeus handing out fates
out of an urn like...
like they were lottery tickets.
"You're gonna work on a tylium ship.
You're gonna be an admiral.
"Your family's gonna be
"evaporated
in an attack on the Colonies,
"but you'll survive for three more years
in a moldy compartment on a freighter
"till your body
starts to eat itself up alive."
Those are the gods that you worship?
Capricious, vindictive.
But they're not meant
to be taken literally.
They're metaphors, Emily.
I don't need metaphors.
I need answers.
You're like my mother. She wasn't
satisfied with metaphors either.
She was convinced that Aphrodite herself
was gonna swoop her away when she died,
and she believed it.
Even after the Doloxan
and the radiation
failed to stop her cancer.
She was a teacher. She was a...
She was something to behold in...
At the head of a classroom.
And her students...
Her students loved her. They...
they'd walk through fire for her.
And then you see this woman who...
seemed so...
eternal, she...
withered away,
and I find myself
having to change her diaper
because she couldn't even...
And at the moment she died,
there was no gleaming fields of Elysium
stretched out before her.
There was this...
dark...
black abyss.
And she was just terrified.
She was so scared.
I'm sorry.
Laura.
Laura.
You were terrified.
You saw only darkness.
You can't possibly
know what your mother experienced.
You're... you're still searching.
You're...
Doc Cottle! Doc!
- Do something!
- Nurse, get me some morpha quickly.
It's okay.
It's all right.
All we can do for her now is...
try to make her comfortable.
- That's all?
- I'm sorry, that's it.
All right.
It's as if
she doesn't even see us anymore.
She's looking past us.
I've seen that look many times,
but never in the eyes of a Cylon.
Athena.
You were right.
Forgive me.
It's okay.
I'm with you.
She will lead us to the end.
We will now know the truth
of the opera house.
The home of the 13th.
What?
The hybrid said, "the missing Three
will give you the Five
"who have come
from the home of the 13th."
The home of the 13th tribe of humans...
And the Five...
is your Final Five Cylon models.
And if they've come
from the home of the 13th tribe,
they must know the way back.
They know how to get to Earth.
And the missing Three
is the model you boxed
- for looking at the faces of the Five.
- D'Anna.
She can recognize 'em.
Let's go.
Demetrius is waiting for us.
We're here.
Mother.
You're okay.
I'm not ready.
<i>... You no longer
need to fear the unknown.</i>
<i>Because he will take your hand</i>
<i>and guide you
to the other side of the river.</i>
<i>What river am I talking about?</i>
<i>I'm talking about the river
that separates this world from the next.</i>
<i>There is more to reality</i>
<i>than the things that we can touch,</i>
<i>taste,</i>
<i>or even see with our naked eyes.</i>
<i>There is another realm.</i>
All hands to jump stations.
Prepare to jump the ship.
<i>All hands to jump stations.
Prepare to jump the ship.</i>
Come on, come on.
Sublight.
Go.
- Helm.
- Go.
- Nav.
- Go.
- Tactical.
- Go.
Jump solution checks. Nav is go.
FTL.
Drive's spun up 100% and stable, go.
The board is green.
She's gone.
Or they'd be back by now.
Execute jump in five...
Four... Three...
Dradis contact!
Cylon baseship.
It's right on top of us.
Hold the count! Hold the count!
Baseship is squawking colonial ID.
I've got a comm signal,
but it's really weak.
Speakers!
<i>Demetrius, Athena.
Demetrius, Athena.</i>
Gods, it's good to hear your voice.
Copy that, Helo.
The baseship is ours.
Mission accomplished.
Then let's go home.
I need to talk to you.
- Certainly. Come in.
- Thank you.
- Can I get you some water?
- Yes.
You really believe that there's
something in this horse manure that
Baltar's peddling?
I don't know.
Something is happening here,
and I don't really understand it, Bill.
You both had the same dream,
means...
What?
Talk to me. What's going on?
Kara comes back from the dead.
I let her go off chasing her vision
of Earth.
Well, she's overdue.
Lee
turns in his wings.
And Helo, Athena, Gaeta.
Will I ever see those kids again?
Bill.
Look at me.
I'm right here.
Right here.
We're going to find it.
Earth?
Together.
I used to think
it was such a pipe dream.
I used to use it
as a carrot for the fleet.
What made you change?
You.
You made me believe.

12 MODÈLES CYLONS
7 SONT CONNUS
4 VIVENT CACHÉS
LE DERNIER SERA RÉVÉLÉ
<i>Précédemment dans
Battlestar Galactica...</i>
Je te donne un vaisseau.
Maintenant, va.
Trouve le chemin de la Terre.
<i>Kara, je suis seul,
ce n'est pas une attaque.</i>
<i>- Je savais que je te trouverais.
- Leoben ?</i>
<i>Je suis là pour offrir une trêve
entre les humains et les Cylons</i>
<i>et une chance pour
que tu termines ton voyage.</i>
L'hybride.
Tu dois aller la voir, Kara.
Elle te dira comment trouver
le chemin de la Terre.
Nous avons fini.
Sortez-le de là.
Prêts pour le bond de retour,
à votre ordre.
On n'y retourne pas.
Capitaine Thrace,
en tant que XO du Démétrius,
je vous relève de facto
de votre commandement.
Fils de pute.
Gaeta, annulez le bond !
Je vais avec Leoben au vaisseau mère,
pour voir si son histoire se confirme.
On attendra
jusqu'à la fin du compte à rebours.
Apparemment il n'a pas menti
à propos de la guerre civile.
C'est ça.
La comète. C'est le vaisseau !
Cela va donc se produire.
Tu es le signe avant-coureur de
la mort, Kara Thrace.
Vous les mènerez tous à leur fin.
<i>- Vaisseau mère Cylon.
- Démétrius, Athena.</i>
Le vaisseau mère est à nous.
Alors rentrons chez nous.
<i>J'ai appris, de source sûre</i>
<i>que la Présidente Laura Roslin,
depuis quelque temps,</i>
<i>partage des hallucinations</i>
<i>avec deux Cylons de notre flotte.</i>
<i>L'une, Sharon Agathon,</i>
<i>envoyée sur le Démétrius
pour une mission confidentielle,</i>
<i>et l'autre, une prisonnière Cylon
retenue à bord du Galac...</i>
Ce n'est pas si facile,
Madame la Présidente.
Vous devriez essayer parfois.
La plupart des gens
ont écouté cette émission.
Je suppose que c'était le but.
Écoutez, je n'éprouve aucun plaisir
à vous imposer ça.
En fait, ils ont dû me forcer
à passer cette porte.
Je suis sûre que vous êtes
heureux d'être là.
Je ne peux pas faire un pas
sans que l'on m'interroge
sur ce qui se passe !
- Pour le bien-être de la flotte...
- Excusez-moi.
Aussi longtemps que
je serai dans ce bureau,
le bien-être de la flotte
n'est pas quelque chose dont vous
avez besoin de vous inquiéter.
Vous devez une réponse aux gens.
Je leur dois ?
C'est ce que je crois.
Et si toutes vos croyances
étaient remises en question ?
- Mme la Présidente...
- Le haut est en bas. Le noir est blanc.
Les Écritures ne sont que fiction.
Votre foyer est de l'air au lieu
d'un sol solide,
- Et ainsi de suite.
- Vous savez, je suis vraiment désolé
pour tout ce que vous devez endurer.
Réellement.
Mais ces gens,
ils méritent une réponse.
- Vraiment ?
Y a-t-il une once de vérité
dans cette émission ?
Et que feriez-vous
si je vous disais la vérité ?
Si vous étiez à ma place,
et que tout ce qui reste de l'humanité
venait d'entendre que vous
partagez des visions avec l'ennemi ?
Que feriez-vous M. Adama ?
Penseriez-vous que les Dieux
vous testent ?
Alors Baltar dit la vérité ?
Est-ce vrai ?
Oui.
Le Démétrius dit que leur système
d'exploitation sera synchronisé
au nôtre dans 5 min.
Quand tu es arrivé avec ce Raider
pour nous demander notre aide,
tu as mis entre nos mains l'avenir
de vos Cylons, sais-tu ça ?
Je l'ai donné à la bonne personne.
N'oublie pas. Aucune garantie.
Quand nous rejoindrons la flotte,
je ne sais pas s'ils vous nourriront
ou vous exploseront, compris ?
Puisque vous jouez le jeu
jusqu'à présent,
je suppose que vous pourrez discuter.
Bien.
Que les Dieux nous aident.
Les systèmes des deux vaisseaux
sont synchronisés.
Nous sommes aussi prêts
que possible.
Bien.
Dis au Démétrius de
mettre ses voyants au vert.
Si on ne fait pas le bond ensemble,
le Galactica va nous faire sauter.
<i>Démétrius, Athena.</i>
<i>Mettez vos voyants au vert.</i>
Athena, Démétrius.
Nous mettons les voyants au vert.
C'est l'heure les gars.
Allumage.
Prêt.
Commandes ?
Prêtes.
Tactique ?
Prête.
Navigation ?
Prête.
PRL ?
Moteurs chauds. Prêts.
Athena, Démétrius.
<i>Tout est au vert.</i>
J'étais en train d'imaginer
à quel point elle doit être belle.
Ta fille, Hera.
Comment sais-tu son nom ?
Nous le connaissons tous.
Tu as été bénie.
Très bien, tout le monde.
Rentrons chez nous.

Colonel.
Ils sont avec moi.
Ils sont avec vous ?
Lequel d'entre eux a tiré sur Gaeta ?
<i>Lieutenant Gaeta, restez avec nous.</i>
Bon, tout le monde recule.
Apportez-moi tout de suite
le plateau chirurgical.
Nous avons commencé à nous diviser,
entre les modèles.
Les Deux, Huit et Six
ont commencé à croire
que nos destinées étaient liées
à la recherche des 5 derniers.
Les Un, Quatre et Cinq
se sont violemment opposés
à une telle action.
Nous savons qu'il y a
7 différents modèles de Cylons.
Vous n'en avez mentionné que 6.
Les Trois. Les D'Annas.
Elles ont été archivées après
la bataille sur la planète des algues.
Archivées ?

dans un centre d'archivage.
Pourquoi ?
D'Anna a vu les visages des 5 derniers,
ce qui était interdit.
Mais si nous la libérons,
elle pourra nous révéler qui ils sont.
Les 5 derniers sont allés sur Terre.
Si nous les aidons à les trouver,
ils pourront nous y emmener.
Notre vaisseau peut se soigner seul,
mais la plupart de nos Raiders
ont été détruits dans l'embuscade.
Nous avons besoin de votre aide,
nous ne pouvons y arriver seuls.
Qu'est-ce qui pourrait nous motiver
à vous faire confiance ?
Qu'offrez-vous ?
Le serveur d'archivage...
Se trouve sur le principal
vaisseau de résurrection Cylon.
Ce serveur contrôle les fonctions
de chacun des vaisseaux
de résurrection existants.
Il se protège en effectuant des bonds
à intervalles réguliers
vers de nouvelles coordonnées, et les
renvoie aussitôt au vaisseau-mère.
Madame la Présidente,
vous vouliez une raison
pour nous aider ?
La vengeance.
Vous détruisez le serveur...
Et les Cylons perdent la capacité
de se télécharger.
Nous tous.
Pourquoi accepteriez-vous de perdre
votre capacité à ressusciter ?
Nous sommes des rebelles.
Nous ne pouvons plus rentrer.
Tout ce qui nous importe,
c'est d'être avec les 5.
D'Anna sera capable de les identifier.
Nous vous emmènerons au serveur
si vous nous aidez
à libérer D'Anna.
Donnez-nous les coordonnées
du serveur central d'abord.
Non, pas question, j'ai dit
que nous vous y emmènerions.
Faites-la sortir. Nous avons terminé.
Attendez.
Êtes-vous un homme de parole Amiral ?
Je vous donnerai les coordonnées,
mais je veux votre parole.
Attendez.
Vous avez ma parole.
Une fois que leurs identités
seront révélées
et que nous serons de retour ici,
nous serons libres
de quitter votre flotte avec les 5.
Oui.
Ils sont ici avec vous.
Les 5 derniers sont dans votre flotte.
C'est pour ça que nos Raiders ont
stoppé leur attaque
dans la nébuleuse.
Suspendre l'attaque.
Comment Diable avez-vous su ?
Pour être totalement
honnête avec vous, Bill,
je n'ai rien vu.
Que puis-je dire ?
Nous avons eu de la chance.
Envoyons un Raptor
aux coordonnées que les Cylons
nous ont données.
Peut-être serons-nous
à nouveau chanceux.
Monsieur
Tigh.
Merci.
Seigneurs de Kobol,
protégez-nous.
Filmez ça.
Superposez-le.
Charmant, pas vrai ?
Rapportons ça à la flotte.
Non, ne m'endormez pas,
je vous en prie.
Anesthésiez juste la jambe.
Félix.
Faites-le.
Je ne veux pas me réveiller,
je ne veux pas me réveiller
et ne plus voir ma jambe.
D'accord fiston.
Si on débarque comme ça,
on ne tiendra pas 5 min.
Mais si nous y allons
avec ce vaisseau-mère garé dehors,
on ne nous remarquera pas
tout de suite.
Et on se bat avec quoi ?
Leurs Raiders sont détruits.
On ne s'en sert pas.
On prend les nôtres.
- On prend la moitié de l'escadrille.
- La moitié ?
On les attire
sur le vaisseau-mère rebelle.
Hoshi a fait quelques calculs
à partir des photos de Racetrack.
Nous retirons le PRL
et on y relie le serveur central.
On le fait sauter et...
Des millions de synthétiques
perdent le privilège de la baignoire.
Imaginez.
Une fois morts,
ils ne peuvent plus revenir.
Des ennemis mortels.
Avant de faire sauter le serveur,
nous devons envoyer une équipe
pour libérer D'Anna.
En fait,
peut-être qu'on ne devrait pas.
Pourquoi ne pas simplement oublier
ce foutu serveur d'archivage.
- Mentir aux rebelles.
- Ils nous mentent bien.
Les synthétiques ont dit que leurs
Raiders ne se battraient pas
parce que les 5 derniers sont ici ?
Nous nous frittons avec
ces bâtards noirs à l'œil rouge
depuis bientôt 3 ans,
et ils n'ont jamais abandonné avant.
Pourquoi maintenant ?
Et s'ils nous disent la vérité et
que les 5 derniers sont bien ici ?
Les 5 pourraient connaître
le chemin vers la Terre.
Quand bien même,
ils ne nous guideront pas
si nous détruisons
leur capacité à ressusciter.
Peut-être sont-ils différents,
comme les rebelles.
Et s'ils ne le sont pas ?
Et si leur seul objectif
est de nous détruire ?
Je dis : on réduit tout en poussière,
sans exception, et on se fie
à la vision de la Présidente,
ses Écritures,
son chemin vers la Terre.
Pourquoi ne pas couper
la poire en deux ?
Libérer D'Anna. Trouver les 5.
Les 5 nous guident vers la Terre.
On les livre aux rebelles
qui attendent ça depuis longtemps.
On fait ça à nos conditions.
Tout ceci reste entre nous messieurs,
jusqu'à ce que nous sachions
ce qui est vrai ou pas.
Et on la ferme sur ce sujet.
Le vrai plan
ne sort pas de cette pièce.
Si ce plan parvient aux oreilles des
Cylons, tout tombe à l'eau.
Envoyez quelqu'un pour escorter le
chef des rebelles à son vaisseau-mère
afin qu'elle puisse informer les autres
du marché.
"Dans 36 heures,
les Colonies uniront leurs forces
avec des rebelles Cylons et leur leader
dans une opération militaire
sans précédent,
pour détruire la capacité
des Cylons à se télécharger..."
Bla bla bla.
Pourquoi n'avons-nous pas
été consultés ?
Je suis désolé,
je n'en sais pas plus que vous.
Vous savez, s'ils libèrent les D'Anna,
on saura au moins qui est le cinquième.
Ça ne fera qu'encombrer
le sas,
un peu plus.
Croyez-vous qu'ils vous donneront
une médaille
quand ils découvriront qui vous êtes ?
Et vous ?
Il chante vous savez.
Quoi ?
Gaeta.
Quand il sent les picotements,
quand il sent sa jambe fantôme.
Cottle dit que ça l'aide à surmonter.
Il chante.
Bonjour.
Bonjour.
Qu'est-ce qui, à bord du Galactica,
vous fait autant rayonner ?
Quand je viens ici,
c'est comme aller
d'une cellule à une autre.
Oh, je n'avais pas remarqué.
Mais merci.
- Vous êtes prête ?
- Oui.
Je veux que vous trouviez
qui est derrière les rumeurs
concernant mes visions.
Qui lui en a parlé ?
À Baltar ?
Vous couchez avec lui, n'est-ce pas ?
Non.
Je viens juste d'apprendre
que vous êtes considérée
comme une des fondatrices
de sa bande de nymphomanes.
Très bien.
J'en suis venue à croire
au discours mystique de Baltar.
Je ne sais ni comment ni pourquoi,
mais c'est arrivé.
J'aimerais que vous sachiez le nombre
de fois où j'ai voulu vous le dire.
Votre amitié et votre confiance sont...
Merde.
Manifestement mon amitié et
ma confiance sont de la merde.
Et je n'en ai rien à faire
si vous passez vos nuits
à genoux pour prier
ou pour autre chose.
Je veux un nom.
Je veux savoir qui est
responsable de ces mensonges.
Madame la Présidente.
Laura, je suis vraiment désolée...
Vous avez un travail à faire.
Les humains ne nous laisseront jamais
repartir avec les cinq derniers
et tracer notre route.
Tu es sûre de ça ?
Pas entièrement.
Je préférerais avoir tort,
mais nous avons besoin de garanties.
La confiance doit bien
commencer quelque part.
Pas avec nous.
C'est notre vaisseau.
Quand nous sauterons,
nous en prendrons le contrôle
avec les Centurions.
Nous effectuerons la mission
comme prévu.
Mais quand nous reviendrons,
nous prendrons des otages.
Les humains sur ce vaisseau
resteront ici
jusqu'à ce que nous ayons les cinq.
Regardez-moi.
Nous avons changé,
mais pas les humains.
Nous sommes allés trop loin
pour tout risquer
en leur faisant confiance.

Étrange manière de découvrir
une si belle voix, non ?
Comment m'avez-vous trouvée ?
Votre maître d'équipage.
Il mérite le fouet.
Si vous êtes descendu ici
pour me soutirer des infos en douceur,
vous perdez votre temps.
Le Quorum prépare une
motion de censure
contre vous.
Je ne compromettrai pas
le succès de cette opération
ou la sécurité de la flotte
pour satisfaire le mécontentement
de 12 représentants
perpétuellement insatisfaits.
Je ne peux pas.
J'étais avec eux pendant...
le bond d'urgence.
Et j'ai vu quelque chose
sur le visage des délégués.
Ce n'était pas l'angoisse de l'attente.
C'était plus que cela.
J'étais anxieux,
c'était ma première fois.
Mais eux, ils...
Ils étaient vides.
Le Quorum a baissé les bras.
Puis ça m'a frappé,
après avoir vécu la
même routine
si souvent
c'était le seul moyen pour eux de
surmonter les doutes.
De s'attendre au pire.
Vous avez senti leur souffrance.
Maintenant, essayez
de les soutenir tous les jours.
Parlez-leur.
Ne leur dites pas tout.
Je sais comment ça se passe.
Mais parlez au Quorum.
Laissez-les regarder en face
cette mission conjointe.
Laissez-les écouter le chef des Cylons.
Tout.
Tout est bon pour qu'ils laissent
leurs peurs de côté.
Qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
Rien.
Oui, c'est ça,
Rien du tout.
On attend ici, les bras croisés,
sans rien faire
Quoi ?
Tu as menti
sur les visions que la Présidente
partage avec les Cylons.
Il se trouve
que c'était la pure vérité.
Désolé, je ne peux pas
accepter ce que tu as fait.
Quoi ? Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?
Qu'est-ce que... ? Quels... ?
D'où est-ce que ça sort ?
Ces rumeurs que tu as lancées.
J'ai vu ce qu'elles lui ont fait.
Crois-tu vraiment
que j'ai préparé tout ça ?
Je ne dis pas que
je n'en suis pas capable,
mais pourquoi l'aurais-je fait ?
Six me l'a dit.
Caprica Six me les a révélées
par le biais de mon avocat
pendant les derniers jours
de mon procès
quand ma culpabilité
était devenue une certitude.
J'aurais pu rendre cela public.
Provoquer un retournement.
Et tout ce temps,
tu as gardé le silence.
Je ne dis pas que je suis
un saint, Tory.
Je suis beaucoup de choses.
Mais j'essaie de
ne pas m'adonner à la rancune.
Je n'ai pas de soif
de vengeance envers elle.
Mais c'est une hypocrite.
Les mensonges...
Les missions secrètes.
Se servir de la rhétorique patriotique
pour laisser tout le monde
dans l'ombre, toi y compris.
C'est plutôt désolant,
n'est-ce pas ?
Donc il fallait que je parle.
La vérité est que
aucun bien ne peut
découler de sa dissimulation.
J'ai une émission.
<i><b>The first that she</b></i>
<i><b>be spared the pain</b></i>
<i><b>that comes from a dark</b></i>
<i><b>and laughing reign</b></i>
<i><b>when she </b></i>
<i><b>finds love</b></i>
<i><b>may it always stay true</b></i>
<i><b>this I beg</b></i>
<i><b>for the second wish</b></i>
<i><b>I made too</b></i>
Je ne suis pas venue implorer,
supplier ou m'excuser
ni pour garder mon job
Vous me connaissez mieux que ça.
Et je ne suis pas venue
solliciter votre sympathie
en exhibant ma maladie devant vous.
Au contraire, certains
pensent probablement
qu'à travers mon cancer
et mes traitements,
je suis immunisée
contre la compassion.
Je plaisantais.
Je suis là parce que je veux
vous dire en face
que je crois en cette mission
et en ce qu'elle signifie
pour notre avenir.
Je suis ici pour
renouveler ma confiance
envers nos nouveaux alliés.
Je suis ici pour vous demander
d'écouter.
Je suis ici
pour demander votre soutien.
Faites-la entrer.
Dans notre guerre civile,
nous avons vu des morts.
Nous avons regardé notre
peuple mourir.
Parti pour toujours.
Aussi terrible que ce fut,
hors d'atteinte des
vaisseaux de résurrection,
quelque chose a commencé
à changer.
Nous pouvions ressentir
le temps,
comme si chaque moment
portait sa propre signification.
Nous avons commencé à réaliser
que pour que notre
existence en vaille la peine,
elle devait s'achever.
Pour vivre des vies qui aient un sens,
nous devons mourir
et ne jamais revenir.
Ce fameux défaut humain,
que vous passez vos vies
à déplorer...
la mortalité...
c'est la chose...
c'est la chose qui fait
de vous des êtres entiers.
Je crois que
ce n'était pas un accident
si Kara Thrace nous a trouvés.
C'était le destin.
Elle m'a demandé de quitter
mon peuple, et j'ai accepté.
Quel que soit le sacrifice
même ce devait être ma propre mort...
Cela arrivera donc.
Le chef mourant
connaîtra la vérité
au sujet de l'Opéra.
Tu es le signe avant-coureur de
la mort, Kara Thrace.
Notre destin,
notre avenir
commencent ici.
Merci de m'avoir donné
la possibilité de m'exprimer.
Emmenez-là.
<i><b>But wish no more</b></i>
<i><b>my life you can take</b></i>
<i><b>to have her please</b></i>
<i><b>just one day wake</b></i>
<i><b>to have her</b></i>
<i><b>please</b></i>
<i><b>alone she sleeps</b></i>
<i><b>in the shirt of man</b></i>
<i><b>with my three wishes</b></i>
<i><b>clutched in her hand</b></i>
Héra !
Héra !
Bye bye.
Je devrais vous féliciter.
Si vous êtes un Cylon,
c'était un plan génial.
Nous proposer une nouvelle
route vers la Terre.
Nous y envoyer.
Les 5 derniers.
Et le grand final, introduire
les 5 derniers dans la flotte.
Même moi, je n'aurais pas fait mieux.
Vous avez ces visions,
n'est-ce pas ?
Alors ça va se produire.
Le leader mourant apprendra
la vérité
sur l'Opéra.
Qu'avez-vous dit ?
Alors ça va se produire.
L'Opéra.
Le leader mourant apprendra
la vérité sur l'Opéra.
Où avez-vous entendu ça ?
Qui vous l'a dit ?
L'hybride du vaisseau-mère
avant qu'ils le débranchent.
L'hybride.
Comment l'hybride sait-elle ce qu'il
y a dans mes rêves ?
J'aimerais le savoir.
Ça doit cesser.
Ces visions.
Je dois découvrir
ce qu'elles signifient.
Je dois le savoir.
Allez-vous m'aider ?
Oui.
Allez chercher le Capitaine Agathon.
<i>Quand j'ai parlé au Quorum,</i>
j'ai pu le sentir.
Le mépris.
Tu avais raison.
Ils ne sont pas prêts à
nous faire confiance.
Non, j'avais tort.
Nous ne sommes pas prêts.
Nous leur mentons.
Pour notre protection.
C'est nécessaire.
Par suspicion et par peur.
Pourquoi les 5 derniers
ne se sont pas montrés ?
Et si ils observent,
jugeant nos actions ?
Nous sommes sur le point d'avoir
recours à la violence et à la force.
Et s'ils refusent de venir
avec nous ?
Nous ne pouvons pas faire ça.
C'est trop tard.
Nous devons demander aux
Centurions de se retirer.
C'est trop tard.
Ils se sont déjà engagés.
Alors nous devons dire
la vérité aux humains.
Non, tu ne peux pas faire ça.
Ils ne nous feront
plus jamais confiance.
Ils connaissent déjà
les coordonnées.
Ils vont simplement
tout détruire.
Allez. Gagne du temps.
Va parler à Adama.
Dis-leur tout.
Tout sauf la vérité.
Je vais m'occuper
des Centurions.
<i>Evidemment.</i>
<i>Prenez place.</i>
Nous allons régler
ça maintenant.
Régler quoi ?
Votre subordonnée
a un talent incomparable.
Je partage ces visions
avec Sharon Agathon et la numéro 6.
Donc je ne disais que la vérité.
Oui.
L'hybride sur le vaisseau-mère a parlé
d'un Opéra et d'un leader mourant.
Nous allons parler à l'hybride.
Et pourquoi auriez-vous besoin de moi ?
Parce que vous êtes dans mes visions.
Alors, mon coeur ?
Tu dessines ?
Je peux voir tes dessins ?
Non !
Pourquoi ?
Héra ?
Raptor 1-2-4, paré pour l'appontage.
Héra !
- Tu as vu ma fille ?
- Non.
Héra ! Héra !
Je ne trouve pas Hera.
Héra !
Écarte-toi de mon enfant.
Ne la touche pas !
Athéna.
Restez en arrière !
Restez à l'écart.
Baissez vos armes !
Branchez-la.
Je dois lui parler.
Laissez la volonté de Dieu s'accomplir.
Fermez-la.
Il est temps d'obtenir
quelques réponses.
Tyrol, pourrais-tu approcher
et prendre Héra, s'il te plaît ?
Faites-le, Tyrol.
Est-elle partie ?
Oui.
Tu ne prendras jamais mon enfant.
Nous ne sommes pas
venus ici pour ça.
Bond !

Petit soutien à Titof33...
Previously on Battlestar GALACTICA...
I'm giving you a ship. Now go.
Find a way to Earth.
Kara,I'm alone,
this is not an attack.
I knew I'd find you.
Leoben?
I'm here to offer a truce
between human and cylon
and a chance for you to
complete your journey.
The hybrid.
You need to go to her,Kara.
She'll tell you the way to get to Earth.
We're done here.
Get him out of here.
We're ready to jump back
to the fleet on your order.
We're not going back to the fleet.
Captain Thrace,as XO of the Demetrius,
I'm hereby relieving you of command.
You son of a bitch.
Gaeta,abort the jump!
I'm gonna take Leoben
back to the baseship,
see if his story checks out.
We'll be waiting here
till the clock runs out.
looks like he wasn't
lying about a civil war.
This is it.
The comet.
It's the ship!
Thus will it come to pass.
You are the harbinger
of death, Kara Thrace.
You will lead them all to their end.
cylon baseship.
Demetrius,athena.
The baseship is ours.
Then let's go home.
now I have learned from
unimpeachable sources
that president Laura
Roslin has for some time now
been sharing hallucinogenic visions
with two cylons within our fleet:
One Sharon Agathon,sent on the
classified Demetrius mission,
and the other a cylon prisoner
being held aboard the Galactica.
It's not that easy,madam president.
No?You should try it sometime.
Most of the population
has heard that broadcast.
I would assume that's the point.
Look,I take no pleasure
in putting this before you.
In fact,they practically had
to push me through that door.
Well,I'm sure you're
quite happy to stay.
I can't put one foot in front of another
without someone blocking my path
asking me what the hell is going on!
- For the welfare of the fleet...
- excuse me.
As long as I am in this office,
the welfare of this fleet is not
something you need to worry about.
You owe the people a response.
I owe the people?
That's what I believe.
What if suddenly all your
beliefs were called into question?
- Madam president...
- up is down.
Black is white.
Scripture is fiction.
Home is thin air instead
of solid ground,etcetera.
You know,I'm really sorry for
everything you've had to endure.
I really am.
But the people,they deserve a response.
Do they?
Is there any truth to this broadcast?
And what would you do
if I told you the truth?
What if it were you instead of me
and all that's left of
humanity has just been told
that you are sharing
visions with the enemy?
What would you do,mr. Adama?
Would you think that the
gods were testing you?
So Baltar is telling the truth?
Is it true?
Yes.
Demetrius reports their sys ops will
be synced with ours in five minutes.
When you came knocking with that
raider and asked for our help,
you gave away the future of
all the cylons aboard this ship.
You know that,right?
I gave it to the right person.
Save it.
No guarantees.
When we meet up with the colonial fleet,
I don't know if they'll feed
you or frak you,all right?
Since you've been calling
the plays up till now,
I'm assuming you're doing the talking.
Good.
Gods help us.
Sys ops of both vessels are synced.
We're as ready as we're ever gonna be.
Good.
Tell the Demetrius to
set the board to green.
Unless both ships jump in together,Galactica
will blow us out of the sky.
Demetrius,Athena.
Set your board to green.
Athena,Demetrius. Starting to green.
Let's run the horn,guys.
- Sublight.
- Go.
- Helm.

I was just thinking how

We all know her name.
You were blessed.
all right,everyone.
Let's go home.
Demetrius,Athena.
Execute jump.
Clock is running.

colonel,they're with me.
They're with you?
So which one them shot Gaeta?
Lieutenant Gaeta,stay with us.
All right,everybody. Stand back.
And get a cut down
tray in here right now.
we became divided according to models.
The twos,eights,and
sixes have come to believe
that our destiny lies in
seeking out the final five.
The ones,fours,and fives
violently opposed such action.
We know that there are seven
different models of cylons.
You only mentioned six.
The 3s.
The D'Anna's.
They were boxed after the
battle on the algae planet.
Boxed?
Her entire line was
punitively deactivated.
Her consciousness placed
in a boxing facility.
Why?
D'Anna saw the faces of the
final five,which was forbidden.
But if we unbox her,she can
reveal their identities to us.
the final five have been to earth.
If we help find them,they
can help us get there.
Our ship can heal itself.
But most of our raiders
were destroyed in the ambush.
We're asking for your help
here. We can't do it alone.
What could possibly
motivate us to trust you now?
What have you got?
The boxing facility resides
within the cylon resurrection hub.
This hub controls the functions of
every resurrection ship in existence.
It protects itself by periodically
jumping to a new set of coordinates
and then relaying them
back to the baseship.
Madam president,you asked
for a reason to help us.
Vengeance.
You destroy the hub,cylons
lose their ability to download.
All of us.
Why would you be willing to
lose your ability to resurrect?
We're rebels.
We can't go back.
What matters most to us
is being with the five.
D'Anna will be able to identify them.
We'll take you to the hub
if you help us unbox d'Anna.
Give us the coordinates
of the hub first.
No,I won't do that.
I said we would take you there.
Take her out. We're finished.
Wait.
Is your word good,admiral?
I'll give you the coordinates.
But I want your word.
Stand down.
You have my word.
Once their identities are
revealed and we come back here,
we'll be free to leave
your fleet with the five.
Yes.
They're here with you.
The final five are in your fleet.
That's why our raiders turned
back the attack in the nebula.
The weapons hold.
How the frak did you see that?
To be absolutely honest
with you,bill,I didn'T.
What can I say?We got lucky.
Well,let's get a raptor up to those
coordinates that that cylon gave us.
Maybe we can get lucky again.
Sir.
Tigh.
Thank you.
Lords of Kobol,shield your eyes.
Get it with the gun camera.
Hit override.
Kinda pretty,isn't it?
Tell it to the fleet.
No. No. Don't put me under. Please.
Just... just numb everything.
- Felix.
- Just do it.
I- I don't want to wake up... I don't
want to wake up with my leg gone.
Okay,son.
If we go in on our own horse,we
won't last five minutes.
But we go in with that
baseship parked out there,
nobody's gonna notice us for awhile.
What do we fight with?Their
raiders are frakked.
We don't use theirs.
We use ours.
Take half the viper wing.
- Half the wing?
- Yeah.
We'll sneak them in
on the rebel baseship.
Hoshi did some calculations
from racetrack's photos.
We take out the ftl
and the hub's stranded.
We blow the hub and,uh,billions of
skin jobs lose their bath privileges.
imagine.
Once they're gone,they can't come back.
Mortal enemies.
Before we blow the hub,we need
to get a team in to unbox d'anna.
Well,now,maybe we just don'T.
Maybe we just forget the
gods damn boxing facility.
Lie to the rebels.
Well,they're lying to us.
The skin jobs said their raiders won't
fight because the final five is here?
We tangled with those slit-eyed
black bastards for three years now,
and they haven't turned
back before. Why now?
What if they're telling the truth?
What if the final five are here?
The five could know the way to earth.
If they knew,they're
not gonna lead us there
after we've just destroyed
their resurrection capacity.
Maybe they're different,like the rebels.
What if they're not?
What if their sole
purpose is to destroy us?
I say we blow the whole
gods damn thing to dust...
lock,stock,and barrel... and
trust the president's vision,
her scriptures,her way to earth.
Why don't we split the difference?
Unbox d'Anna and find the five.
Keep the five till we get to earth.
Turn them over to the rebels.
They've waited this long.
It'll be on our terms.
It's all pie in the sky,gentlemen,until
we know what's true and what's not.
And we put a lid on it.
The real plan stays in this room.
If the plan gets leaked to
the cylons,all bets are off.
Have someone escort the rebel
leader back to her baseship
so she can inform her
people they have a deal.
"In 36 hours,"the colonies will unite
forces "with insurgent rebel cylons
and their leader
"in an unprecedented
joint military operation
"to destroy the cylons'
ability to download into.
" blah blah blah.
Why weren't we consulted?
I'm sorry.
I'm in the dark as much as all of you.
you know,if they unbox the D'Annas,at
least we'll find out who the fifth one is.
All that's gonna do is
crowd the airlock a little more.
Do you think they're gonna give you a
medal when they find out who you are?
what about you?
He sings,you know.
- What?
- Gaeta.
Whenever he feels the tingling.
Whenever he feels his phantom leg.
Cottle says it helps him get through it.
He sings.
Good morning.
Morning.
What is it about the Galactica
that gives you such a glow?
I come over here,it's like I'm
going from one dungeon to the next.
Oh,I hadn't noticed.
But thank you.
You ready?
Yes.
I want you to find out who's
behind the shared vision rumors.
Who's talking to him?
With Baltar?
You're sleeping with him,right?
Don't.
I've just been informed that
you've been spotted down there
enough times to be a charter
member of his nymph squad.
All right.
I have come to believe in
Baltar's spiritual message.
I don't know how or why.
It just happened.
I wish you knew how many
times I wanted to tell you.
Your friendship and
your trust means... frak.
Clearly my friendship
and trust mean frak.
And I don't really care if
you have to spend the night
on your knees praying
or just on your knees.
I want a name.
I want to know who's
responsible for these lies.
Madam president.
Laura,I am so sorry.
You have a job to do.
The humans are never going to allow us
to have the final five
and go our own way.
Are you sure of this?
Not entirely.
I'd rather be wrong.
But we need insurance.
Trust has to begin somewhere.
Not with us.
It's our ship.
When we jump,we take control
of it with the centurions.
We carry out the mission as promised.
But when we return,we take hostages.
The humans on this ship stay on
this ship until we have the five.
Look at me.
We've changed,but the humans haven'T.
We've come too far to risk
everything on their trust.
alone she sleeps in the shirt of man
with my three wishes
clutched in her hand
the first that she be spared
the pain that comes from a dark
and laughing reign when she
finds love may it always stay true
what a way to discover
such a beautiful voice,huh?
How'd you find me?
Your chief of staff.
Needs to be horsewhipped.
If you came down here to kiss my ass
to get information,save your breath.
The quorum's considering a vote
of no confidence against you.
I won't compromise the
success of this operation
or the safety of this
fleet to indulge the
neediness of 12 perpetually
unhappy representatives.
I can'T.
I was with them on
the,uh,emergency jump.
And I saw something in
the faces of the delegates.
It wasn't the anxiety from waiting.
It went beyond that.
I was anxious.
It was my first time.
But they... they.
they were empty.
The quorum had given up.
And then it struck me that after going
through the same routine so many times,
it was the only way that they
could cope with the uncertainty.
To presume the worst.
You felt their suffering.
Now try holding their
lives in balance every day.
Talk to them.
You don't have to tell them everything.
I know how it works.
Just talk to the quorum.
Let them put a face
to this joint mission.
Let them hear from the cylon leader.
Anything.
Anything to put their fears to rest.
What's the matter?
- Nothing.
- No,nothing.
Nothing at all.
We've been lying here doing nothing.
What?
You've been lying about the
president sharing visions with cylons.
That happens to be
the god's honest truth.
Sorry.
I can't accept what you've done.
What... what I've done?
What have I...?
What are... where's this coming from?
These rumors you've started.
I've seen what they've done to her.
You seriously believe that
I'm making all this up?
I am not saying I'm not
capable,but why would I?
Six revealed it.
Caprica six revealed them
to me through my attorney
in the last days of my trial when
a guilty verdict was a certainty.
I suppose I could've gone public.
- Caused a stir.
- And all this time,you kept quiet.
I'm not saying I'm a saint,tory.
I'm many things.
But I try not to be spiteful.
Got no bloodlust to go get her.
But she's a hypocrite.
The lies.
The secret missions.
Co-opting the rhetoric of patriotism to
keep everyone in the dark,including you.
That's rather worrying,isn't it?
So I had to speak.
The truth is,no good ever
comes from concealing it.
I've got a broadcast.
The first that she be spared the pain
that comes from a
dark and laughing reign
when she finds love
may it always stay true
this I beg for the
second wish I made too
I didn't come here to beg or plead
or apologize or to keep my job.
You know me better than that.
And I didn't come here to create sympathy
by parading my illness in front of you.
On the contrary,there are some
that probably believe that
along with my cancer and drugs,
I have inoculated myself
against compassion.
That is a joke.
I am here because I want
to tell you face to face
that I believe in this mission
and what it means for our future.
I'm here to profess my
trust in our new allies.
I'm here to ask you to listen.
I'm here to ask for your support.
Bring her in.
In our civil war,we've seen death.
We've watched our people die.
Gone forever.
As terrible as it was beyond the
reach of the resurrection ships,
something began to change.
We could feel a sense of time,as if
each moment held its own significance.
We began to realize that for our
existence to hold any value,it must end.
To live meaningful lives,we
must die and not return.
The one human flaw that you spend
your lifetimes distressing over...
mortality... is the one thing.
well,it's the one thing
that makes you whole.
I believe it was no accident
that we were found by Kara Thrace.
It was destiny.
She asked me to leave
my people,and I accepted.
No matter what the sacrifice
even if it should mean my death.
thus shall it come to pass.
The dying leader shall know
the truth of the opera house.
You are the harbinger
of death,kara thrace.
Our destiny.
Our future.
Begins here.
Thank you for giving me
the opportunity to speak.
take her out.
But wish no more my
life you can take to have
her please just one day
wake to have her please
alone she sleeps in the shirt of man
with my three wishes
clutched in her hand
Hera!
Hera.
Bye-bye.
I gotta hand it to you.
If you are a cylon,that
was a great plan.
Dangle yet another way to earth.
Throw in the hub,the final
five,and the real kicker,
put the final five on the fleet.
Even I couldn't pass that one up.
You are having those visions,aren't you?
Thus shall it come to pass.
The dying leader shall know
the truth of the opera house.
What did you say?
Thus shall it come to pass.
The opera house.
The dying leader shall know
the truth of the opera house.
Where did... where did you hear that?
Who told you that?
The hybrid from the baseship
before they unplugged it.
The hybrid.
How does the hybrid
know what's in my dream?
I wish I knew.
This has got to stop.
These visions.
I've got to find out
about these visions.
I've got to know.
Will you help me?
Yes.
Find captain Agathon.
when I spoke to the
quorum,I could feel it.
The contempt.
You were right.
They're not ready to trust us.
No,I was wrong.
We're not ready.
We're deceiving them.
For protection.
For necessity.
Out of suspicion and fear.
Why haven't the final five come forward?
What if they're watching,judging
us on our actions?
We're about to resort
to violence and coercion.
What if they refuse to come with us?
We can't do this.
It's too late.
We have to order the
centurions to stand down.
It's too late.
They're committed.
Then we have to tell
the humans the truth.
No,you can't do that.
They'll never trust us again.
They already know the coordinates.
They'll just go destroy everything.
Go.
Stall for time.
Talk to Adama.
Tell them anything.
Anything but the truth.
I'll deal with the centurions.
Of course.
Have a seat.
We're going to settle this now.
What's to settle?
Your chief of staff is
incomparably talented.
I've been sharing visions with
Sharon Agathon and the six.
So I was only speaking the truth.
Yes.
The hybrid on the baseship spoke of
an opera house and a dying leader.
We're going to talk to the hybrid.
And why would you require my presence?
Because you're in my visions.
What are you doin',baby?
Are you drawing?
Can I see what you drew?
Oh,no.
No!
Why?
Why?
Why?
Hera?
Hera?
Hera!
Raptor 1-2-4,you are
cleared for landing...
Hera!
Hera.
Hera!
Have you seen my daughter?
No,I haven'T.
Hera!
Hera!
Hera!
Hera!
I can't find hera.
Hera!
Get away from my child.
Get your hands off of my child.
Athena.
Stay back!
Stay away.
Stand down!
Plug it in.
I need to talk to it.
Let god's will be done.
Shut up.
It's time to get some answers.
Tyrol,will you come in
here and take hera,please?
Just do it,tyrol.
Is she gone?
Yeah.
You are never gonna take my child.
We didn't come here to.
JUMP!
To have her please just one day wake
to have her please just one day wake
12 MODÈLES CYLONS
7 SONT CONNUS
4 VIVENT EN SECRET
LE DERNIER SERA RÉVÉLÉ
<i>Précédemment dans
Battlestar Galactica...</i>
Alors ça va se produire.
Le leader mourant apprendra
la vérité sur l'Opéra.
Où avez-vous entendu ça ?
Qui vous l'a dit ?
L'hybride du vaisseau-mère
avant qu'ils le débranchent.
J'ai besoin de savoir
ce que signifient ces visions.
Branchez-la.
C'est le moment
d'obtenir quelques réponses.
Je peux voir ce que tu dessines ?
Héra ?
Écarte-toi de mon enfant !
Tu ne la prendras jamais.
Bond !
Seigneur tout-puissant...
Donne-moi la force...
Et la volonté, par-dessus tout...
Vite !
C'est bien...
Á 3.
1... 2... 3...
Soulevez-la !
Gardez la pression sur cette blessure
jusqu'à ce que j'arrive à l'artère.
Mettez-lui le masque à oxygène.
La Présidente a été enlevée ?
- On dit que Baltar y était...
- Serait-il le responsable ?
- Ce serait des Cylons.
- Non, l'un d'entre eux a été blessé.
De qui parle-t-on, de Roslin ?
Un militaire a tiré sur un Cylon,
c'est peut-être la cause de tout ça.
- Alors où est Zarek ?
- Je ne sais pas !
Le Vice-président attend toujours
pour vous parler,
que dois-je lui dire ?
Amiral ?
Decker dit qu'ils sont partis
avec 40 de nos Vipers ...
et presque autant de pilotes.
On doit réorganiser l'escadrille,
et réévaluer notre défense.
Où est-elle ?
Ils l'ont mise aux arrêts.
Amenez-la dans mes quartiers.
Personne ne nous dit rien.
Monsieur le Vice-président !
Nous avons quelques questions.
Restez tous calmes, svp !
Monsieur le Vice-président,
il est important que nous sachions...
La Présidente est-elle décédée ?
Nous n'avons pas d'informations...
- Les Cylons l'ont assassinée ?
- Ce n'est pas sûr.
D'après ce que nous savons.
Que diable savons-nous ?
Nous avons besoin d'informations
concrètes et vérifiables.
Pour cela, j'ai fait appel à l'Amiral
pour répondre à nos questions.
Malheureusement,
il n'a pas pris mes appels.
Néanmoins... Néanmoins...
SVP, un moment.
Apparemment, la Présidente Roslin,
accompagnée de Gaïus Baltar
et d'un groupe de pilotes, se trouvait
sur le vaisseau-mère qui a sauté,
en même temps, un leader Cylon se
faisait tirer dessus, sur le Galactica.
Nous ne savons pas si ou quand
la Présidente reviendra vers la flotte.
Par conséquent, et au vu de
mes fonctions accordées par la loi...
J'assume la présidence.
Le fait de ne pas parler à Zarek,
rend le Quorum suspicieux.
Leurs soupçons ne me concernent pas.
Il n'est sûrement pas l'homme idéal
mais le second dans la hiérarchie.
La flotte a besoin de stabilité
et de tranquillité
comme seul un commandement
militaire peut l'offrir.
Si cette flotte a besoin d'être
rassurée, alors rassure-les.
C'est ton travail maintenant.
Dis à Zarek qu'il aille au diable.
Pourquoi ?
Vous les haïssez tant...
que vous cherchez des excuses
pour en tuer un,
ou juste pour saboter cette trêve ?
Non Amiral, évidemment pas.
Alors expliquez-moi la raison...
qui me fera comprendre votre acte.
Ils allaient me la prendre.
<i>La N°6.</i>
Elle allait prendre mon enfant.
Tous les témoins ont dit
la même chose.
Votre fille s'est perdue,
et la Cylon s'est mise à genoux
pour lui parler.
Cela ressemblait à ça pour les autres,
mais moi je sais !
Vous savez quoi ?
J'ai eu une vision, où la N°6
et Baltar me la prenaient.
Une vision !
Plus qu'une vision, Monsieur !
Quand je les ai vus ensemble,
j'ai su
qu'ils allaient me la prendre.
Ma fille !
Vous avez assassiné...
Une femme sans défense,
mettant la vie de chaque personne
de cette flotte en danger.
Et probablement causé la perte
de la Présidente et de votre mari.
Vous avez désobéi à un ordre
direct d'un supérieur.
Mais le plus important...
vous avez trahi la promesse
que vous m'aviez faite...
Je vous faisais confiance !
Monsieur, je me plierai
au châtiment que je mérite.
Je demande juste
qu'on ne me retire pas mon enfant.
Je crains qu'une cellule
ne soit pas un endroit
pour une fillette.
Gardes !
Sortez-la de ma vue.
L'Amiral Adama a, par le passé,
soutenu le gouvernement de Baltar.
Pensez-vous qu'il fera
de même avec vous ?
Je crains que seul l'Amiral Adama
puisse y répondre.
Alors je pose la question
au délégué Adama.
Croyez-vous que votre père
accréditera ce gouvernement ?
Non.
<i>- Nous ne serons pas en mesure...
- Aucune autorité...</i>

Bon épisode à tous...
Très bien.
Le Raptor de reconnaissance signale
que le vaisseau de
résurrection est parti.
Aucun signe du vaisseau
transportant la Présidente,
ni de traces d'où ils sont partis.
Ils sont déterminés
à réactiver le Modèle 3 ...
qui est connu sous le nom de D'Anna.
De facto, nous devons retrouver
le vaisseau de résurrection.
Nous le trouvons,
nous trouverons les nôtres.
- Plus facile à dire qu'à faire.
- Sans doute.
Nous avons d'autres problèmes.
Starbuck a des difficultés à
trouver du personnel qualifié.
Elle veut que les vaisseaux
se rapprochent
pour les rendre
plus faciles à défendre.
Cela signifie que les civils
volent en formation réduite...
Arrangez ça.
Quand je vous ai obtenu ce job,
ce pouvoir et offert mes faveurs,
je pensais
que vous feriez de bonnes choses.
Maintenant, vous me conseillez
de ne pas prétendre à une position
que la loi me confère.
Une position à laquelle j'ai été élu.
Mais vous n'avez jamais
été élu Président.
Mais j'ai été élu au gouvernement !
Ce qui est plus que Roslin.
Pourquoi croyez-vous
qu'elle m'ait mis là, à la base ?
Comme compensation
pour céder ma place ?
Non...
C'était pour donner
une légitimité à son putsch.
Dans l'armée...
on s'appuie sur des faits,
comme le Quorum.
Ces faits sont ce qu'ils sont.
Que vous ayez raison ou tort,
Adama ne va pas vous
reconnaître comme Président,
et nous avons besoin
de quelqu'un qu'il accepte.
<i>Cependant, le Quorum
a l'autorité pour désigner</i>
un Président en période de crise.
Et je suppose que vous avez
quelqu'un à l'esprit.
Non.
Non, pas encore.
C'est pourquoi nous avons
besoin d'un comité
pour rechercher
des candidats potentiels.
Bonne chance pour ça.
<i>Mr Le Vice-Président, cela n'est-il pas
un danger pour le gouvernement ?</i>
<i>Regardons les faits, Jim.</i>
<i>Ces 5 dernières années,
ce n'était pas un vrai gouvernement,</i>
<i>mais un accord tacite entre
un militaire puissant</i>
<i>et une dame de fer
qui tente de tout régir par décrêt.</i>
<i>Je sais que le Quorum a autorisé la
création d'une force de défense civile.</i>
<i>Après le dernier putsch militaire,
nous ne voulons pas dépendre</i>
<i>du Galactica
pour assurer notre sécurité...</i>
Vous voyez le problème !
Première règle de Lampkin sur
la dynamique de la législation :
quand une force irrésistible
croise un obstacle immobile,
il faut patienter,
et voir qui survit.
Mais c'est une situation
qui ne profite à personne,
on peut pas rester assis
pour recoller les morceaux.
Cela va finir dans un bain de sang,
à moins que ...
À moins que nous trouvions
quelqu'un d'autre,
que votre père n'a pas rejeté
et que le Quorum approuve.
Quelqu'un qui serait Président
par intérim à la place de Tom Zarek,
jusqu'à ce qu'il y ait
de nouvelles élections.
Ne prenez pas l'affaire, maître.
C'est perdu d'avance.
Je dois le faire.
Nous devons le faire.
Personne du Quorum
ne va bouger un doigt.
Zarek leur inspire la peur
et transpire la colère.
Mais vous avez affronté la flotte
et vous connaissez les gens.
Vous avez vraiment besoin d'une raison,
pour quitter cette pièce ?
À moins que vous ne vouliez
m'expliquer
ce qui vous retient ici ?
Impossible de vous en dissuader ?
Vous n'avez pas parlé de mes frais.
Vos honoraires ?
Contrairement aux apparences,
je travaille pour de l'argent.
J'ai une réputation
à maintenir après tout.
Que vous a donné Roslin
pour la défense de Baltar ?
Une chambre avec vue.
Je ne suis pas sûr d'être
en mesure d'améliorer cela.
Ce sera donc bénévole, maître.
Les sages disent
qu'il vaut mieux parfois se satisfaire
de ce qu'on a déjà obtenu.
Colonel Tigh ...
J'ai cru comprendre
que vous aviez une relation...
avec la prisonnière Cylon.
Je n'utiliserai pas ce mot,
mais elle est plus coopérative.
Voyez si elle peut nous renseigner
sur le relais de résurrection.
Bill.
On la retrouvera.
On les retrouvera tous.
Comment pouvons-nous retrouver
le relais de résurrection ?
- Je suis sûre que vous le savez déjà.
- Vous. Dites-le moi !
Seuls les hybrides peuvent
le localiser,
et uniquement
après avoir effectué un bond.
Ils ne peuvent
anticiper le point d'arrivée.
Vous me cachez quelque chose.
Je le sens.
Vous mentez.
Je ne vous ai jamais menti, Saul.
Pourquoi douter maintenant ?
Car il y a
trop de vies en jeu ma chère.
Vos amis ont disparu
avec la moitié de la flotte,
sans oublier
la Présidente des Colonies elle-même.
C'est elle la véritable raison
de votre colère ?
Vous êtes très inquiet,
je l'entends à votre voix.
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi une femme mourante
est si importante pour vous ?
Pas pour moi, par les dieux,
pour le patron !
L'Amiral Adama ?
Saul ?
- M'aimes-tu ?
- Quoi ?
Sois honnête avec moi,
comme je l'ai été avec toi.
Je n'y crois pas...
Tu me demandes si...
<i>Attention !
Le vaisseau passe en Condition 1 !</i>
<i>- Ce n'est pas un exercice...
- C'est allé trop loin !</i>
Je ne sais pas à quel jeu vous jouez
avec mon esprit, jeune fille,
mais ça s'arrête ici !
Qu'est-ce qu'on a ?
L'un de nos Raptors disparus semble
être à portée de dradis.
C'est l'un des nôtres ?
Le signal correspond à l'un des Raptors
envoyé sur le vaisseau-mère rebelle.
Pas de trace de radiations.
Racetrack et Skulls
sont en chemin pour l'intercepter.
<i>Ici Racetrack.
Je suis juste en face de l'oiseau.</i>
Il a dû être touché plusieurs fois,
il perd du carburant et de l'oxygène.
Toujours pas de réponse à nos appels.
Quelqu'un a bien fait faire
le bond à cet oiseau !
Je ne peux rien voir d'ici.
Skulls, prends les commandes,
je vais faire une petite balade.
<i>Décompression terminée.
Ouverture du sas.</i>
<i>Sécurités en place,
je me dirige vers l'autre Raptor.</i>
<i>Les systèmes semblent être
gravement endommagés.</i>
<i>On dirait qu'il n'y a rien dedans.</i>
<i>J'ai réussi à ouvrir,
mais c'est coincé.</i>
<i>Pas de gravité.</i>
C'est Pike...
<i>Il est mort.</i>
C'est une navette...
Elle retournait... Au vaisseau-mère.
Laird a pu récupérer
les données de navigation indiquant
que le point de saut a eu lieu
à un point éloigné du secteur Delta 9.
Le Président Zarek a encore appelé
au sujet du Raptor...
Il veut être débriefé.
Rappelez l'escadrille.
Faites chauffer les moteurs FTL.
- Et pour la flotte ?
- Allons-y.
<i>Nous ne recherchons pas
seulement un remplaçant.</i>
Le problème est que...
quelle que soit la personne
entre les mains de laquelle
va reposer le pouvoir politique,
elle ne le fera pas
sans voir son propre intérêt.
Et ce sont ses intérêts personnels
qui peuvent compromettre
l'idéal altruiste de cette quête.
En d'autres termes, c'est une bataille
entre l'idéal et l'ego,
où l'ego l'emporte toujours.
Roslin n'a jamais voulu ce pouvoir.
L'exception qui confirme la règle.
Quelqu'un assimilerait Laura Roslin
à un cas d'école d'ambition réprimée.
Tout comme vous, Mr Adama.
Vous ne cherchiez pas de travail
et il vous est tombé entre les mains.
Chef d'escadrille, Commandant
de Battlestar et délégué au Quorum...
Un homme ne peut pas
faire son chemin dans la vie sans...
Assez de psychanalyse pour aujourd'hui.
Revenons à l'affaire en cours.
Votre père a-t-il prévu
de se rendre quelque part ?
Quoi ?
Mais où vont-ils bon sang ?
Pourquoi ne nous ont-ils rien dit ?
Galactica, ici Racetrack.
Nous avons trouvé
la source de l'émetteur.
C'est le Viper de Sam ?
<i>Aucun signe de Sam.</i>
Compris. Continuez à chercher.
Nous avons des signaux radioactifs
d'explosions multiples,
des fragments de vaisseaux-mères,
ainsi que des traces
d'une technologie de résurrection.
J'ai peur que ça ne présage
rien de bon.
Ils ont trouvé et détruit le relais.
C'est comme si nos pilotes
les avaient aidés.
La question est, où sont-ils partis ?
Bill, vous êtes bien trop impliqué.
Le vaisseau-mère de la Présidente
a été détruit.
Elle était dans un autre
vaisseau-mère !
<i>Vérifions chaque zone de ce secteur</i>
<i>jusqu'à ce qu'on trouve un indice.</i>
Et laisser la flotte seule,
sans aucune protection ?
Laissons 4 Raptors derrière nous.
Ils continueront de chercher jusqu'à
trouver quelque chose de concret.
Transmettez mes ordres !
<i>Qu'allons-nous faire ?</i>
Tout le monde assis, svp !
Asseyez-vous !
- M. le Président
- S'il vous plaît...
L'Amiral Adama ne viendra pas
répondre à nos questions.
Je suis seulement entré en contact
avec le commandant de la flotte
qui m'informe que quelques vaisseaux
sont réquisitionnés
pour les recherches du vaisseau-mère
disparu où se trouvait Laura Roslin.
Les vaisseaux ravitailleurs
seront déviés
pour aider cette mission.
Il a décidé cela
sans consulter le Quorum !
Je comprends, et nous ferions mieux...
Nous essayerons de leur parler...
Suivez-moi.
Le Capitaine Franks ?
Son aisance en tant que juge
m'a impressionné
pendant le procès de Baltar.
Ça et son vote évidemment.
On lui a déjà proposé
de travailler pour nous,
mais elle n'est pas
intéressée par la politique.
Elle m'a vraiment impressionné.
Seigneurs !
Vous ne nourrissez jamais cet animal ?
Où est-il d'ailleurs ?
Allez Romo, viens par là.
<i>Qui Adama respecterait
comme Président ?</i>
On peut faire mieux que cette...
recherche de citoyens modèles inutile.
Le plus grand de nos péchés
c'est de posséder des points faibles.
Ou pire... L'idiotie de croire
à un nouveau début.
On repart à zéro.
Nous n'avons pas encore rayé
tous ces noms.
C'est une perte de temps.
Un exercice totalement futile.
Avocats...
Quels effets l'interruption
du traitement aura sur la Présidente ?
En ne supposant aucun changement
dans ces circonstances ?
Oui.
Le Doloxan est très fort,
elle se sentira mieux au début.
Mais tout arrêt, donne une occasion
au cancer de se renforcer.
Plus tard, le traitement
sera plus compliqué,
affaiblissant ses défenses, la rendant
plus vulnérable aux infections.
Combien de temps ?
Disons que plus tôt vous la ramènerez
meilleures seront ses chances.
Quitte à ce que ce soit dur à digérer,
j'ai autre chose à vous dire.
J'ai fait quelques tests
sur notre prisonnier Cylon.
Devinez ce que j'ai trouvé ?
Les Raptors seront là
dans quelques heures.
Mais s'ils avaient trouvé
quelque chose,
je suis sûr qu'on aurait
déjà eu de leurs nouvelles.
Néanmoins, si nous analysons
les rapports...
Je ne suis pas intéressé…
par les recherches.
Non ?
Tu as passé beaucoup de temps
à interroger le N°6.
Les gardiens m'ont dit que tu les
congédiais à chacune de tes visites
et que tu stoppais les caméras.
Je ne la torture pas,
si c'est ça qui te préoccupe.
Ce n'est pas ça.
Ça, je pourrais le comprendre,
mais là j'ai du mal.
Cottle m'a dit qu'elle est enceinte.
À quoi diable pensiez-vous, Colonel ?
Le nierais-tu ?
Pas cette fois.
Tu ne peux pas !
À quoi pensais-tu, bordel ?
Qui interrogeait qui ?
Combien de secrets lui as-tu donné ?
Comment peux-tu me demander ça ?
Comment peux-tu douter de ma loyauté ?
C'est ça ta loyauté ?
J'ai besoin de plus que cette loyauté.
Tu es mon second.
J'ai besoin que tu sois intègre.
J'ai besoin de tes compétences !
Ce vaisseau est en danger
à cause de tes faiblesses.
- Mes faiblesses ?
- Oui ! Faiblesses !
Tu es celui qui risque nos vies,
pour qui ?
A cause des pilotes absents ?
Non, pour une femme !
Pour une foutue bonne femme !
Attention à ce que tu dis sur elle,
c'est la Présidente,
pas un foutu Cylon avec qui je couche.
Que dirait Ellen ?
Laisse Ellen en dehors de ça.
Que crois-tu qu'elle dirait
si son mari mettait enceinte
une putain de prisonnière Cylon ?
Fils de pute !
Tu sais combien de fois
j'ai dû réparer cette chose ?
Que vas-tu faire avec cette femme ?
Et que vas-tu faire avec Laura,
si on la retrouve ?
Je ne sais pas.
Prenez des Raptors
et quelques vaisseaux civils,
commencez les recherches
depuis la dernière position connue.
Ça pose un problème ?
Amiral, avec tout le respect...
J'ai déjà deux pilotes disparus.
Nous avons à peine de quoi
protéger la flotte.
Maintenant on envoie
des Raptors à l'aveuglette,
pour trouver un vaisseau
qui pourrait avoir été détruit.
Mes pilotes voudraient que je vous
demande si c'est une mission suicide.
Ce n'était pas une question.
Vous pouvez disposer, Capitaine.
Amiral Adama ?
M. Lampkin, que faites-vous ici ?
Voici les demandes de décharge
pour les vaisseaux
que vous réquisitionnez.
Les capitaines ne veulent pas être
tenus responsables en cas de problème.
Une des moins nobles conséquences
d'une culture procédurale.
Personne ne veut prendre
de responsabilités.
Lee m'a dit que vous lui aviez donné
quelque chose avant une mission.
Un briquet, non ?
Il a appartenu à mon père.
C'est dingue de penser
qu'un morceau de métal
puisse vous protéger.
N'est-ce pas que ce que nous faisons ?
Nous nous accrochons à l'espoir,
de toutes les manières
irrationnelles possibles.
Mais pas comme ces pauvres idiots
qui laissent passer leur chance
juste quand ils en ont le plus besoin.
On dirait qu'ils ont renoncé.
Si vous n'êtes jamais allé au combat,
vous n'avez aucune idée
de ce qu'ils pensent.
Je vous ai toujours considéré
comme un réaliste, Amiral.
Pas du genre à laisser croire dans un
vain espoir pouvant leur coûter la vie.
Mais après réflexion...
Nous avons tous nos limites.
<i>Sine qua non, comme ils disent.</i>
<i>- Sans laquelle rien ne serait...
- Oui.</i>
Les choses que nous
considérons essentielles
sans lesquelles on ne peut pas vivre,
sans lesquelles la vie
en général
perd sa spécificité,
et devient abstraite.
Vous pourriez avoir raison, maître.
En parlant de ça...
Tom Zarek n'est peut-être pas
le Président idéal,
mais nous pourrions avoir
quelqu'un de pire.
Vous avez raison.
Il y a des limites à mon réalisme.
Au revoir, maître.
Je ne peux pas l'abandonner.
Je ne peux pas la laisser partir.
J'ai perdu mon objectivité.
Et maintenant que je le réalise,
je n'ai pas le choix.
Dis au Quorum que je quitte
mon poste, immédiatement.
Aucun homme n'est parfait.
Aucun homme ne peut être
parfait sous les projecteurs.
Donc...
la liste des candidats potentiels
ne mène nulle part.
Et si on inversait le problème ?
Au lieu de faire la liste
des noms et de leurs défauts...
Cherchons plutôt
les qualités requises.
Non, celles dont a besoin
le nouveau chef de l'Exécutif.
Et voir si quelqu'un
rentre dans ces critères.
Honnêteté. Naturellement…
La capacité de reconnaître…
le bon choix, bien qu'impopulaire…
aussi bien que le courage
d'aller de l'avant.
L'expérience...
Quand les mauvais choix coûtent
des vies et que les bons en sauvent.
Affichons ça.
Tout ceci tend vers un seul nom.
Juste un.
Le favori depuis le début.
Parfois vous devez
défendre une cause perdue
et faire en sorte d'y croire.
Tout le temps, peu importe
ce que vous pensez en vous-même.
Votre cœur...
sait comment réparer ça.
Le verdict est inévitable.
Lance.
La défense est satisfaisante.
Allez.
Désolé,
je ne pouvais pas attendre
pour vous le dire.
- Me dire quoi ?
- Nous avons trouvé un candidat.
Quelqu'un que le Quorum
n'hésitera pas à approuver
si jamais ils avaient des objections.
Quelqu'un que l'Amiral ne pourrait
aider, mais accepter.
Oui... Qui ?
Félicitations M. Le Président.
Mon nom n'a jamais été
sur cette liste.
Bien sûr que non.
Ce serait trop flagrant.
Mais c'est ce que
vous avez toujours voulu, non ?
Pourquoi m'avoir demandé de chercher
dans les 47 noms de cette liste ?
Allez...
Admettez-le...
Savourez votre victoire M. Adama.
Parce que vous n'aurez pas
l'occasion d'occuper ce poste.
- Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
- Pourquoi ?
Car vous êtes parfait pour ce job,
bien sûr...
Car après l'abérrante
présidence de Baltar,
et l'amère déception qu'a été Roslin,
vous êtes...
une lueur brillante d'espoir.
Seulement l'espoir est la dernière
chose que nous ayons besoin.
Nous sommes un race comdamnée.
Il est temps de faire la paix
avec cette vérité essentielle.
- De quoi parlez-vous ?
- Pourquoi...
Vous voulez savoir pourquoi...
Ouvrez-le !
Ils ont tué mon chat.
- Ils ?
- Eux.
Ces rebus de l'humanité, là-bas.
La tribu perdue à la recherche
d'une nouvelle maison,
pour qu'ils puissent
s'installer et repartir encore !
Depuis quand est-il mort ?
Depuis quand ? Ça ne signifie rien.
Ce n'était pas mon chat !
Romo, il est mort depuis des semaines.
C'était celui de mon épouse...
Je le ramenais de Gemenon
quand les bombes
ont commencé à tomber.
Le destin m'a fait choisir :
Je pouvais retourner
à ce transport, ou...
revenir chez moi
pour essayer de sauver ma famille.
- Que croyez-vous que j'ai choisi ?
- Romo !
Nous avons tous eu des choix
difficiles dans la vie, non ?
Le nom de votre épouse était Faye,
Vous avez eu 2 filles,
Jennifer et Katie.
Il y avait plus de 200 passagers
dans ce transporteur.
Seulement quelques-uns
ont choisi de rester.
C'était dans les registres que j'ai lu
quand j'étais l'avocat de Baltar.
Personne n'est à blâmer Romo.
Parfois nous faisons des choix
qui sauvent des vies
au détriment d'autres.
Vous croyez être le seul, Romo ?
Que vos péchés sont spéciaux ?
Est-ce que c'est une excuse ?
Allez-vous construire votre défense
sur ce point de vue pathétique ?
Non, à moins...
qu'un nouveau départ
soit seulement une illusion,
comme vous l'avez dit.
Mais d'une certaine manière,
notre foi en nous-même
nous amène à survivre,
comme espèce, comme peuple.
Ce n'est pas déterminé,
c'est un choix.
Et je fais le mien.
Si vous ne le supportez pas,
le mieux serait de tirer maintenant.
Allez-y...
Vous attendez quoi ?
Vous pouvez aussi faire un choix...
laisser le passé derrière vous...
baisser votre arme...
et m'aider.
Parce que je vous le dis,
je vais faire une différence
dans cette flotte.
C'est votre dernier mot ?
Ça dépend de vous.
Alors prêtez serment.
<i>Moi, Leland Joseph Adama</i>
je déclare et affirme
Prendre la présidence
des 12 Colonies de Kobol
en mon âme et conscience.
<i>Prendre la présidence
des 12 Colonies de Kobol</i>
<i>en mon âme et conscience.</i>
C'est une blague de merde.
Tu es le seul homme
en qui j'ai confiance
pour commander ce vaisseau.
Tu dois être fou pour suivre
ton idée comme ça
mais tu ne peux pas l'être
au point de me laisser le poste.
Aurais-tu oublié la dernière fois ?
c'était un désastre complet.
C'était il y a longtemps.
Tu n'es plus le même homme
que tu étais.
Tu n'es plus le même depuis
que tu es revenu de New Caprica.
Tu as appris beaucoup de choses
et tu es passé par des épreuves
que je n'ose imaginer.
Tu es prêt.
et je précise,
que ce n'est pas permanent.
Et si ça l'est ?
Porte-les.
et dirige la flotte
vers la Terre, du mieux que tu peux.
La flotte est restée
trop longtemps ici.
D'autres derniers ordres ?
Juste un.
Rends sa fille à Athéna.
Elle a besoin de sa famille.
Nous avons tous besoin d'une famille.
Prends soin de celle-ci.
Faites-moi voir les modifications,
avant de l'envoyer à la presse.
- Très bien.
- Merci.
Un jour au pouvoir et déjà
un premier animal de compagnie ?
Je prends soin d'un des héros
de la résistance,
n'est-ce pas Jake ?
Malheureusement, ses anciens
propriétaires l'ont abandonné.
Jake je te présente Romo.
Romo je te présente Jake.
Ton nouveau meilleur ami.
Il y a une chose que je hais
plus que les chats,
ce sont les chiens.
Regarde, un nouvel animal à detester.
Je savais que ce serait
le cadeau parfait.
Bonne chance Jake.
Il paraît que tu maintiens
Zarek comme Vice-président.
Ses conseils peuvent m'être utiles.
Tant qu'il pensera qu'il est écouté,
je pourrai me fier à lui.
Je ne sais pas si je suis
d'accord avec toi mais...
Je pourrais dire la même chose de toi.
La seule différence est
que tu es devenu Président
et moi je vais juste prendre un vol.
Attendre seul dans un Raptor,
alors que le reste
de la flotte fait un bond,
ce n'est pas juste prendre un vol.
Cela ressemble à un suicide, papa ?
Au moins cette fois
je ne risque que ma vie.
Peu importe, en tant que Président,
je t'ordonne de ne pas le faire.
Je ne sais pas si je t'ai
parlé de cela un jour.
Mais ma 1ère mission
était une reconnaissance solitaire.
Moi, seul dans un Raptor
au mileu de l'espace ennemi.
Je te mentirais pas, j'avais peur.
Je me suis dit que je faisais mon devoir
et ça m'a forcé à affronter ma peur.
Ce sont de bons souvenirs.
Pourquoi fais-tu cela ?
Parce que je ne peux vivre sans elle,
et Laura sera au point de rendez-vous.
je dois y croire.
- Amiral.
- Amiral.
Qu'est-ce que vous entendez Starbuck ?
Rien, à part qu'il pleut, Monsieur.
Sortez votre flingue
et ramenez le chat.
Oui, Monsieur.
Laissez les lumières allumées.
Je vais revenir.
Comptez là-dessus.
Galactica, ici Husker.
Je suis en position.
Reçu, Husker.
À tous les vaisseaux de la flotte,
ici le Galactica,
exécutez le bond.
Merci de votre patience
et de votre fidélité...
Merci à toute la Team 6th Race...

TWELVE Cylon MODELS
SEVEN ARE KNOWN
FOUR LIVE IN SECRET
ONE WILL BE REVEALED
Previously on Battlestar Galactica:
"Thus shall it come to pass."
"The dying leader shall know the truth
of the opera house."
Where did you hear that?
Who told you that?
The Hybrid. On the baseship,
before they unplugged it.
I've got to find out
about these visions.
Plug it in.
It's time to get some answers.
Can I see what you drew?
Hera?
Get away from my child!
You are never gonna take her.
Jump!
- ???
<i>-</i>


</i>Let's come along, come along.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>
<i>Watch it, watch it.</i>

Quickly.
All right.
On three:
One, two three.
Lift.
<i>Keep some pressure on that wound
until I can get to the artery.</i>
<i>Mask on.</i>
???
President--
Baltar?
I heard Baltar was with her.
Are you saying he's responsible?
- I heard it was the Cylons.
- No. My people say she was shot.
What are you talking about?
Roslin?
Now, one of Adama's Marines
shot a Cylon,
and that is how this entire
thing has begun.
- So then where is Zarek?
<i>- I don't know!</i>
<i>- Where is Zarek</i>
<i>????</i>
<i>Sir, Vice President Zarek is
still waiting to talk to you.</i>
What should I tell him?
Sir?
??? said they've just shipped over
the last of the vipers,
means we're down to 40 birds
and almost as many jocks.
We're gonna have to reconfigure
the CAP, rethink our defense posture.
- Where is she?
- ????
- ??? are holding her.
- My quarters.
- <i>Nobody has told us anything.</i>
<i>No, no, no.</i>
All right, everybody.
Please calm down.
Mr. Vice President,
may I have some questions for you?
Thank you.
Just calm down, please.
<i>Everybody!
Everybody just calm down, please.</i>
<i>Mr. Vice President,
it's really important that we know.</i>
Is the President dead?
We...We have no information--
I heard she was assassinated by the Cylons.
No, there is no truth to that,
at least as far as we know.
But then what the hell
do we know?
Clearly, our first priority is
to get out as much
verifiable information
as we can to avoid exaggeration--
<i>But what is it that--?</i>
To that end, I asked Admiral Adama
to come and answer our questions directly.
Unfortunately, he wouldn't
take my call.
- <i>At this time, when there is--</i>
<i>- However...</i>
However...please.
Please, just a moment.
???
<i>...on the right.</i>
<i>President Roslin is apparently
aboard the Cylon baseship,</i>
along with Gaius Baltar and
many of Galactica's pilots
when it jumped away,
 after one of their own leaders
was shot aboard Galactica.
We have no idea when or if
they'll return,
or if the President or the other
captives will be subject to reprises.
For now, the powers granted me by law,
I have taken over as president.
<i>Hear, hear.</i>
...
By refusing even to meet with Zarek,
you're simply helping him
fan the quorum's suspicions.
Their suspicions don't concern me.
<i>Look, maybe he's not
the man we hoped for,</i>
but he is next in line, and the fleet
needs reassurance and stability
exactly the kind that only its
military commander can offer.
If this fleet needs reassurance,
then you reassure them.
<i>That's your job now.
You can tell Zarek,</i>
he can go to hell.
- Why?
- Sir...?
Do you hate your people so much
that you look for any excuse to kill one?
What, did you deliberately try
to sabotage this truce?
No sir. Of course not.
Then you tell me why.
You make me understand
why you did this.
They were gonna take her.
The Six.
She was gonna take my child.
There were too many witnesses.
They all said the same thing:
Your daughter was lost.
The Cylon merely kneeled down,
was talking to her.
Maybe that's what it looked like
to the others, sir.
- But I know.
- Oh, you knew better...?
I had a vision, a vision where the Six
and Baltar were taking her away from me.
A vision.
It was more than just a vision, sir.
When I saw them together, I knew
that they would take her,
that they would take away
my child!
You murdered her.
An unarmed woman, and by doing so,
you put the lives of every
 single person in this fleet at risk.
And quite possibly cost the lives
of the President and your husband.
You disobeyed the direct orders
of a superior officer,
but more importantly,
you betrayed a promise to me.
I trusted you.
Sir, I will accept any form of punishment
that you think I deserve.
I just ask that you please
don't take away Hera.
I'm afraid the brigg
is no place for a little girl.
Guards!
- Get her out of my sight.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
At one time, Admiral Adama supported
Gaius Baltar's administration.
Isn't there a chance he'd support yours?
I'm afraid only Admiral Adama
can answer that.
<i>Then I will address this question
to delegate Adama.</i>
Do you honestly think that your father
will hand over power to this administration?
No.
39,674 SURVIVORS
IN SEARCH OF A HOME
CALLED EARTH
Transcript by rogard
Battlestar Galactica
Season 4 Episode 8
"Sine Qua Non"
Fine.
Yeah.
Recon raptor just reported back.
The resurrection hub's gone.
No sign of the base ship
carrying the President,
 assuming that's where they were headed.
They were determined to
resurrect the Three,
what we used to call D'Anna.
To do that, they gotta go
to a hub.
If we find it, we'll find them.
- Easier said than done.
-  Maybe.
We got another problem, sir.
Starbuck's having trouble fielding
enough planes to fly a standard CAP.
Wants us to consider having the fleet
bunched up tighter,
so it's easier to defend.
Means counting on a bunch of
civies flying close formation.
<i>Yeah...</i>
Organize it.
I got you appointed...
to this job. I pulled strings,
called in favours, all because
I thought you might do some good.
Now you're advising me
to step aside from a position
that by law...is mine.
A position I was elected to.
But you were never elected president.
But I was elected to office,
which is more than Roslin can claim.
Why do you think she kept me on
in the first place?
To thank me for rolling over?
No.
No, to help legitimize her coup.
In the military,
we used to talk about
facts on the ground.
Well, the facts on the ground
are these:
Right or wrong, Adama will never
recognize you as president,
and we need someone he will.
Now the quorum has a legal authority
to appoint an interim president
in a time of crisis.
And I suppose you have someone in mind?
No.
No, not yet, Whis is why we need
 to form a search committee
and start looking for candidates
as soon as possible.
Well...
good luck with that.
<i>Mr. Vice President, sir.</i>
<i>You don't believe this
government's in danger?</i>
<i>Let's face facts here.</i>
<i>What we had these past five years
isn't a true government,</i>
but a ??? between a military strongman
and a political strongwoman
<i>to rule together by ???.</i>
<i>I've heard you asked
the quorum to authorize</i>
<i>the creation of a civil defense force?</i>
<i>After what happened during the
last military coup,</i>
<i>we don't wanna depend on Galactica's
marines to guarantee our safety.</i>
You see the problem?
Lamkin's first rule of
legal dynamics:
When an irresistible force
meets a movable object,
stand aside.
Might call for a class action suit.
Except I'm not sure if it's to
anyone's benefit if we just sit around,
waiting to pick up the pieces.
This thing's heading for a showdown.
There's gonna be bloodshed, unless--
Unless you can find someone else,
someone your father won't reject,
someone the quorum would approve of,
someone to take Tom Zarek's place
as interim president
until the next round of elections.
Don't take the case, Counselor.
It's a loser.
I have to.
<i>We</i> have to.
<i>No one on the quorum is going
to lift a finger.</i>
Zarek's got them inhaling fear
and exhaling anger.
But you have taken the pulse of
the fleet ?? and you know character.
And frankly, you need a reason
to get out of this room,
unless you want to start discussing
what's been keeping you here.
So you won't be dissuaded, will you?
Not even when you hear my fee?
Fee?
Appearance is to the contrary,
I'm actually in this for the money.
I have a reputation to
maintain after all.
Okay, so what did Roslin offer
you to defend Baltar?
Room with a view.
I'm not sure I can
improve on that.
<i>Then pro bono it is, counselor.</i>
Words of the wise:
"Sometimes it's better to settle
for what you've already got."
<i>Colonel Tigh.</i>
I understand you've developed a
relationship with the Cylon prisoner.
That's not the word I'd use, but she
has been more cooperative.
See if she'll tell you
anything about the hub.
Bill.
We'll find her.
We'll find all of them.
Your resurrection hub.
How do we find it?
I'm sure the others have told you.
You tell me.
Only our Hybrids can locate it.
And then only after it completes a jump.
Even they can't anticipate
where it's going.
You're holding back something.
I know it.
<i>- You're lying.</i>
- I have never lied to you, Saul.
Why don't you trust me now?
Because there are too many
lives at stake, lady.
Your buddies took off with
half an air wing,
not to mention the president
of the frackin' colonies herself.
She's the real reason
you're so angry, so worried.
I can hear it in
your voice.
Why? Why is a dying woman
so important to you?
Not to me, godsdamnit.
To the old man.
Admiral Adama?
Saul.
- Do you love me?
- What?
Be honest with me.
I've been honest with you.
I don't believe this.
You're asking me--
<i>Attention. Checking
???? aboard the ship</i>
<i>This is not a drill.</i>
<i>This is not a drill.</i>
This has gone too frackin' far.
I don't know what kind of mind games
you are playing with me, lady,
but it ends here!
What have we got?
One of our missing raptors
jumped into DRADIS range.
You're sure it's ours?
Transponder checks out, it's one of
the raptors that boarded the rebel baseship.
No radiological signature.
Racetrack and Skulls are on their way
to intercept.
Actual, Racetrack.
I'm eyeballing our bird now.
Looks shot to hell.
Venting fuel and O2.
Still no response to hails.
Someone had to jump that bird.
I can't see a fracking thing from here.
Skulls, take the wheel,
I'm going for a walk.
<i>Decompression check okay.
Opening hatch.</i>
<i>Safety line secured.
Moving toward the raptor.</i>
<i>I see major damage to the canopy.</i>
<>Looks empty inside</i>
<i>I have the hatch open
but it's stuck.</i>
<i>Grav field's off.</i>
<i>It's Pike.</i>
<i>Dead.</i>
<i>...take a look at.</i>
<i>???</i>
<i>???</i>
<i>???</i>
???
[Searider Falcon]
This is the shuttle
she took over to the baseship.
Laird was able to salvage
the flight data recorder,
puts the originating jump point
deep, sector delta 9.
'President' Zarek called again.
He heard about the raptor,
and he's waiting to be briefed.
Recall the CAP.
Spin up the FTLs.
- What about the fleet?
- Let's go.
We are essentially looking for
an understudy.
Quandary is, one doesn't generally
get the chance
to wield political power without the
ambition to actively seek it.
<i>Easy, Lance.</i>
<i>That same ambition
often compromises</i>
<i>the unselfish motives
that begat the quest.</i>
In other words, a battle of "it"
 vs. "ego", that "ego" rarely wins.
Roslin never sought power.
Exception that proves
the rule.
One could argue that Laura Roslin is
a study in repressed ambition.
Just like you, Mr. Adama.
Never seeking out a job
until it's handed to you.
Flight leader, battlestar commander,
quorum delegate.
A man doesn't carve out a path
like that through life without--
All right, enough of this
psychoanalysis.
Let's get back to the job
in hand.
Does your father have some nother
place he wants to go?
What?
Where the hell do they go?
<i>And why didn't they tell us?</i>
<i>Galactica, Racetrack.</i>
<i>We've located the source
of the transponder.</i>
It's ?? Sandmans's viper all right.
- <i>But there's no Sandman's</i>
- Affirmative. Keep searching.
We're getting radiation signatures
from multiple nukes.
Baseship fragments, other debris
indicative of resurrection technology.
I'm afraid it paints
a pretty clear picture.
They found the hub
and they destroyed it.
Looks like our pilots.
question is, where did they go from here.
Oh, Bill.
You are way too close to this.
<i>The president's baseship
was destroyed.</i>
It's a different baseship.
<i>We'll search every square inch
of this debris field</i>
<i>until we come up with a clue.</i>
What, and leave the rest
of the fleet back there
with their asses hanging in the wind?
Detail of four raptors
will stay behind.
They'll keep searching
until they find something concrete.
<i>Give my order.</i>
<i>Hey people, listen up.
What are we gonna do here?</i>
- They've left 39.000 lives...
- All right, everybody. Gather round please.
<i>- ...weak and undefended.</i>
<i>- Gather round.</i>
- Uh, Mr. President.
- Please, please, please.
<i>I'm sorry, Admiral Adama will not
be coming to answer your questions.</i>
I did learn however, through
 contacts with the fleet's captains,
to inform them that several of
their ships will be requisitioned
to expand the search for Laura
Roslin and the missing baseship.
<i>while our tilium shipments will be
diverted to support that mission.</i>
How do they bypassing us completely?
I understand. I understand.
We're doing the best--
I understand. We're trying to get
through communications--
- That is unconscionable!
<i>- That makes no sense.</i>
- Come on.
<i>- That is nothing short of--</i>
Captain Franks.
I was impressed by her gravitas
during her attorney's judge (??)
in the Baltar trial.
Got no vote,
naturally.
Yeah. She's already been
approached to run for office.
No interest in politics.
Sadly, now she really
impresses me.
Gods!
You wanna feed that animal?
Where is he anyway?
<i>Come on, Romo.
Let's put our heads together.</i>
<i> Who would Adama respect
as president?</i>
How ??? is this?
A search for paragons
and nutters anyway.
It's a greater guilt
other their own failings.(??)
Or worse.
The idiots are losing
if we clean the slate ??.
- Fresh start.
- Wow. Wow!
We haven't ruled out
all these names yet.
This one's a loser. An
exercise in futility.
How is this gonna affect the
president? The break in her treatment.
Assuming no other changes in
her circumstances?
Yes.
Well, doloxan really kicks
your ass,
so she actually might
feel better at first.
But any break gives the cancer
a chance to regroup,
makes it that much harder to
beat it back,
plus she's taken a hit to
her immune systems
so she'll be vulnerable
to infections.
How long?
Well, let's just say, that the
sooner you get her back here,
the better her chances are.
And while you're
digesting that,
I have some other news.
I ran some tests on your
Cylon prisoner.
Guess what I've found.
Raptors are due back in a few hours.
Granted, if they'd found anything, we
would have heard about that by now.
- Still, once we correlate their reports--
- I'm not interested...
- ...in the search.
- You're not?
I know that you've been spending
a lot of time interrogating the Six,
but now the brigg guards tell me that
every time you order them out.
And you turn off the cameras.
I'm not torturing her, if that's
what you're worried about.
I'm not.
That I could almost understand.
This I can't.
Cottle tells me she's pregnant.
<i>What the frak have you been
thinking here, colonel?</i>
Do you deny it?
You don't.
You can't!
<i>What the hell have you
been thinking?</i>
Who was interrogating whom?
<i>How many of our secrets have
you told this thing?</i>
How can you even ask me that?
Question my loyalty?
Your loyalty?
I need more than your loyalty.
You're my first officer.
I need judgment.
I need your competence,
<i>not some jeopardizing this ship,</i>
<i>putting it at risk because
of your weaknesses.</i>
- My weaknesses?
- Yeah, your weaknesses!
<i>You're risking all our lives
for what?</i>
Our missing pilots?
No, for a woman!
For a frakkin' woman!
You watch what you frakking
say about that woman!
She's the president, not some
 frakking skinjob that I've been banging.
What do you think
Ellen would say about all this?
Leave Ellen out of this.
What do you think Ellen would
say about her husband
impregnating a frakking
Cylon prisoner?
You motherfrakker!
You know how many times
I had to bear this thing?
What are you gonna do
with that woman?
What are you gonna do about Laura,
if you ever find her?
I don't know.
Have the raptors and the civilian
ships begin the search
from phantom's last known position.
Is that a problem?
Sir, respectfully...
I've already got two
missing pilots
and hardly enough birds
left to protect this fleet.
Now you're asking me to send the
remains of the raptors out
on a blind search looking for a ship
that very well may have been destroyed.
My people are gonna feel like they're
being asked to go on suicide missions.
I'm not asking.
You're dismissed, captain.
<i>...bunch of Sixes...</i>
<i>Admiral Adama?</i>
Mr. Lampkin, what are
you doing here?
Writs of forfeiture for the
ship's ????.
The captains want to be absolved of any
blame should anything untoward happen.
One of the less ennobling ?? consequences
of a legal culture:
No one wants responsibility.
Lee said you once gave him
something before a mission.
A lighter, was it?
It belonged to my father. Foolish to
think a hunk can middle ???.
...keep 'em safe.
And yet, that's what we do, isn't it?
Hang on to hope,
in every hopelessly irrational
way that we can.
But not like those poor bastards,
giving away their luck,
<i>just when they need it most.</i>
<i>It's like they've given up.</i>
If you've never been in combat,
you have no idea what they're thinking.
I always imagined you were
a realist, Admiral,
not one to indulge a vain hope
to cost of lives.
But then...
everyone has his limits.
'Sine qua non,' as they say.
- "Without which not".
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>Those things we deem essential,
without which we cannot bear living,</i>
<i>without which life in general
looses its specific value,</i>
<i>becomes abstract.</i>
You may have a point, counselor.
And while I'm on a roll:
Tom Zarek may not be
an ideal president,
but we could do worse.
You're right.
There are limits to
my realism.
Get back, counselor.
I can't give up on her.
I can't let her go.
I've lost my objectivity,
and now that I see that,
I have no choice.
Tell the quorum that I am relinquishing
command, effective immediately.
<i>No man is perfect.</i>
No man is less perfect than a
candidate for high office.
Thus...
the ranks of likely suspects
reduced to none.
What if we're going about
this backwards, hey Lance?
What if instead of picking names
and finding fault,
we'd ask ourselves the qualities
that we want, no,
...that we <i>need.</i>
Then your chief executive,
see if it fits that bill.
Honesty, of course.
Get the rest of them to recognize.
Correct.
If unpopular choice, what
matters is courage,
to see it through.
Experience.
When the wrong choices cost lives
and the right ones save.
It's a lot harder. ??
I might as well just
spell out one name.
Just one.
One we knew from the start.
Sometimes you take
on a losing case
and you make yourself a believer.
Other times,
no matter what you tell yourself,
in your heart you know
the outcome is fixed,
and the verdict inevitable.
<i>Lance.
Defense rests.</i>
<i>C'mon.</i>
Apologies.
- I couldn't wait to tell you.
- Tell me what?
We found our candidate.
Someone the quorum won't
hesitate to approve,
even against Zarek's objections.
Someone the Admiral can't
help but accept.
Yeah? Who?
Congratulations,
Mr. President.
My name was never on that list.
Of course not!
That would be too blatant.
But it is everything you
always wanted, isn't it?
Why you had me cross 47
names off that list?
Come on...
admit it.
Savor your victory,
Mr. Adama,
'cause you'll never get
the chance to serve.
- What are you doing?
- Why?
'Cause you're perfect for the job,
of course.
'cause after the vicious separation
that was Baltar's presidency,
and the bitter disappointment
that was Roslin's,
you are a shining beacon of hope.
Only hope is the last thing we need.
We're a doomed race,
and it's time
that we made our peace with
 that essential truth.
Romo, what the hell
are you talking about?
Why? You wanna know why?
Open it!
Frak.
That's right.
- They killed my cat!
"They"?
"They"! Those debased drags
of humanity out there!
Yeah, that lost tribe
in search of a new home,
so they can roost
and rot again.
For how long has the cat been dead?
How long?! It's irrelevant,
it's immaterial!
It wasn't even my cat!
Romo.
It's been dead for weeks.
It belonged to my wife.
I just retrieved it
from a ??? on Gemini.
When the bombs started to fall,
and fate presented me
with a choice:
I could get back
on that shuttle or...
I could run home and...
try to save my family.
- How would you think I chose?
<i>- Romo.</i>
<i>We've all had to make difficult
choices, you don't think I know?</i>
Your wife's name was Faye.
You had two daughters,
Jennifer and Katy!
They were over 200 passengers
on that shuttle,
<i>only a handful chose to stay behind.</i>
Yeah. That's right,
it was in your file
when you headed the job
as Baltar's council.
But no one blamed you, Romo,
because at a certain point,
we all made decisions
that saved our lives
at the cost of others.
You think you're unique, Romo?
Think you're sins are so special?
<i>Is that it, counselor?</i>
You're gonna rest your entire
case on that pathetic...
little bit of insight?
No. Unless...
the clean slate fresh start,
maybe they are illusions,
like you said.
But at a certain point,
faith in ourselves,
<i>in our right to survive as
a species, as a people
that's not a given,
that's a choice.
Well, I've made mine.
And if you can't stomach that,
then you had damn well better
squeeze that trigger right now.
<i>Go on.</i>
What are you waiting for?
So you can make a choice:
Put your past behind you,
put the gun down
and help me, because
I'm telling you
I'm gonna make a difference
in this fleet.
Is that your final word?
That's up to you.
Then swear it.
<>I,
Leland Joseph Adama,</i>
do now avow and affirm...
<i>...that I take the office of
president of the 12 colonies of Kobol</i>
without any moral reaservation
or mental evasion.
<i>...that I take the office of
president of the 12 colonies of Kobol</i>
<i>without any moral reaservation
or mental evasion.</i>
This is a frakking joke.
You're the only man I can
trust to command this ship.
Well, maybe you're crazy enough
to pull a stunt like this,
but you can't be crazy enough
to leave me in charge.
In case you forgot: my last term
at the helm was a complete disaster.
That was a long time ago.
You're not the same
man you were.
You're not even the same man
that came back from New Caprica.
You've found out a lot
about yourself,
been tested in ways I can
barely begin to imagine.
You're ready.
Besides, don't count on
this being permanent.
Whatever it is.
Put these on.
Then you lead the people...
to Earth, the best way you can.
<i>The fleet is ??????
I'm already.</i>
Any other last orders?
Just one.
Give Athena back her daughter.
She needs her family.
We all need our family.
Take care of this one.
All right, let me see the changes
before you get this out to the press.
- All right.
- Thank you.
Mr. Lampkin.
Romo.
One day in office, and you've
already got a first pet.
But Jake here is a genuine
hero of the resistance.
Why don't you check?
<i>Unfortunately, his previous
owners had to let him go.</i>
Jake, meet Romo.
<i>Romo, meet Jake.</i>
You're new best friend.
There's one thing I hate more
than cats. It's dogs.
See, a new pet for you to loathe.
I knew it would be the perfect gift.
Good luck, Jake.
I hear you're keeping
???? as vice president.
I can use the advice.
And as long as he knows
he's heard,
I think I can trust him.
Don't know if I agree
with your thinking, but...
Well, I could say the same
thing about yours.
The only difference is,
you are gonna be president,
and just get in a plane.
Waiting alone in a raptor, while
the rest of the fleet jumps away,
that's not just getting
in a plane.
<i>That...that sounds a lot like--</i>
Well, that sounds a lot
like suicide, Dad.
At least this time I'm
only risking my own neck.
So I guess it won't matter if as
president I order you not to do this?
I don't know if I ever
told you this, but...
one of my first missions was
a solo recon,
being alone in a raptor
in enemy space,
nobody can help you
when you're scared. ??
<i>I told myself that after my duty
I'd have time to face my fear.</i> ??
That's a good memory.
Why are you doing this?
Because I can't live without her.
<i>And Laura is gonna get to rendezvous
point. I have to believe that.</i>
- Admiral.
<i>- Admiral.</i>
What do you hear, Starbuck?
Nothing but the rain, sir.
Grab your gun and
bring the can in.
Yes, sir.
Keep a light on.
I'll be back.
You can count on it.
Galactica, this is Husker.
I'm in position.
Affirmative, Husker.
All fleet ships.
This is Galactica Actual.
- Commencing jump.
- Yes, sir.

12 MODČLES CYLONS
7 SONT CONNUS
4 VIVENT EN SECRET
LE DERNIER SERA RÉVÉLÉ
<i>Précédemment dans
Battlestar Galactica...</i>
Les trois... Les D'Anna...
ont été archivées aprčs la
bataille sur la plančte des algues.
Pourquoi ?
D'Anna a vu les visages
des cinq derniers.
Si nous la libérons, elle
pourrait nous révéler leurs identités.
Les cinq derniers
sont allés sur Terre.
Si nous les trouvons,
ils pourront nous y emmener.
Pourquoi devrais-je avoir
confiance en vous maintenant ?
Le serveur de stockage...
se trouve sur le principal
vaisseau de résurrection des Cylons.
Ce Relais contrôle tous les vaisseaux
de résurrection existants.
On détruit le Relais,
et les Cylons perdent
leur capacité de se télécharger.
L'Hybride sur le vaisseau-mčre
parle d'un opéra et
d'un dirigeant mourant.
Nous allons parler ŕ l'Hybride.
Pourquoi dois-je venir ?
Car vous faites partie de mes visions.
La Présidente Roslin, accompagnée
de Gaďus Baltar
et de pilotes du Galactica,
se trouvait sur le vaisseau-mčre
qui a sauté.
Le Relais a disparu.
Nous avons de multiples
signatures radioactives d'explosions.
Des débris d'un vaisseau-mčre.
Le vaisseau-mčre
de la Présidente a été détruit.
C'est un autre vaisseau-mčre.
Attendre seul dans un Raptor, alors
que le reste de la flotte s'en va,
cela ressemble ŕ un suicide, papa.
<i>Pourquoi fais-tu cela ?</i>
Parce que je ne peux
vivre sans elle.
Deux jours plus tôt.
Branchez-la. Je dois lui parler.
- Laissons Dieu nous juger.
- La ferme.
Il est temps d'obtenir des réponses.
Bond !
Elosha.
Par les dieux !
<i>Filtres... Filtres...
L'élévation sublime...</i>
Nous avons sauté, oů sommes-nous ?
C'est le pourquoi qui m'inquičte.
<i>Filtres...</i>
Pourquoi ne demande-t-on
pas ŕ l'Hybride ?
Et maintenant ?
Elle peut le faire juste comme ça.
elle peut...
Bond !
Voulez-vous marcher avec moi ?
Galactica !
- Que se passe-t-il ? Il est vide.
- C'est vrai.
Il parait plus grand, n'est-ce pas ?
C'est si calme. C'est étrange.
Beaucoup de choses sont étranges.

Bon épisode ŕ tous...
Les battements d'ailes d'une
colombe couvrent le bruit
des battements de cśurs
des poursuivants.
6 est de retour dans le flux.
Ce n'est pas normal.
Re-sauter si rapidement.
Ça signifie quoi ?
Écoutez, elle me connaît.
Elle a confiance en moi.
Je crois...
Je crois męme qu'elle
m'aime bien, parce que...
Vous tirez des informations
de ce liquide ?
L'Hybride est confuse, elle panique.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi.
Dites-moi.
Pourquoi faites-vous
sauter le vaisseau ?
La 6.
La 6 qui est allée parmi
les créateurs n'est plus.
Fin de ligne.
De retour dans le flux qui nourrit
l'océan, qui nourrit le flux.
La 6.
Elle parle de Natalie,
la 6 qui était notre leader.
Elle a dű ętre blessée
ou tuée sur le Galactica.
C'est pour ça que l'Hybride panique.
Donc elle est contrariée.
Ok, bien.
Pouvez-vous...
la calmer ?
Lui dire de faire demi-tour ?
Ça ne marche pas comme ça.
Elle prend ses propres décisions.
Et on ne peut pas la débrancher
car elle est reliée
directement aux systčmes de survie.
Pourquoi ne lui
laisserait-on pas une chance ?
Arrętez de faire sauter le vaisseau.
Calmez-vous.
Fin du compte ŕ rebours.
Fin du compte ŕ rebours.
Circulation, ventilation, contrôle.
Filtres.
- Filtres. La sublime élévation...
- Vous avez vu ça ?
Je me suis ouvert ŕ elle
- sur le plan spirituel...
- Bond !
Ne détestez-vous pas ces personnes ?
Non.
Mais vous ne les aimez pas pour autant.
Les personnes présentes ici
sont ceux qui se rapprochent le plus
d'une famille, et vous...
Vous avez été leur Présidente.
Regardez-les chercher
un peu de réconfort.
Au moins vous ne
leur avez pas pris cela.
Pour l'instant.
Vous ne leur avez pas
volé leur empathie.
Pour l'instant.
Vous n'accordez plus
de place pour les gens.
Vous n'aimez pas les gens.
Est-ce assez clair ?
Assez concret pour vous,
Madame la Présidente ?
Je pense qu'on se dirige
vers le Relais de résurrection.
Je pense que la mission
est toujours d'actualité.
Tu es sűre qu'on ne peut pas prévoir
l'heure d'arrivée au Relais ?
Non, le Relais effectue des bonds et
notre Hybride saute dans sa direction.
Parfois nous arrivons
6 heures aprčs qu'il soit parti.
Parfois, 6 minutes.
Et d'autres fois, il n'est qu'ŕ un saut
de nous, et nous le rattrapons.
Oui, mais on ne sait pas quand.
Donc nous devons considérer
que chaque bond pourrait
ętre celui qui nous mčne
ŕ sa position.
Ils vont détecter les Vipers
ŕ la seconde oů le premier fera feu.
Ils vont détecter
nos équipements électroniques.
Si nous pouvions les masquer.
On y va ŕ froid.
Sans électronique.
Nous envoyons les Vipers ŕ l'arręt
remorqués par des vaisseaux Cylons.
Ils ne les verront jamais venir.
On explose leur PRL,
et on se prépare
pour une longue bataille.
Oui, bien, ok, ok.
Mais toi et moi, nous devons aller
au beau milieu de ce merdier
et essayer de trouver D'Anna.
Nous pouvons le faire.
Non, je ne sais pas.
C'est idiot hein ?
Nous nous mettons
en plein milieu de l'action.
Ce n'est pas un plan génial.
On manque de temps.
Laisse-moi t'aider.
Athena, ma femme,
elle a appris ŕ faire ça.
Elle ne l'avait jamais fait
avant que je la rencontre.
Quoi ?
J'étais curieuse ŕ propos d'Athena.
A propos d'elle, d'Hera et de toi.
Donc, j'y ai eu accčs,
ŕ ses souvenirs
depuis son dernier téléchargement.
Tu as ses souvenirs.
Oui, ils sont
ŕ moi aussi maintenant.
Ils sont aussi réels que les miens.
Ça peut ressembler ŕ une trahison,
ou quelque chose comme ça,
mais je ne veux pas
que ça paraisse étrange, ok ?
Bien.
Ok, bien sűr.
Madame la Présidente ?
Madame ?
J'espčre que je ne vous réveille pas.
Entrez.
Merci de me pręter votre Raptor.
J'avais besoin
d'un environnement familier.
Ne vous inquiétez pas,
je le rendrai au Lt Pike
ŕ la seconde oů
vous en aurez besoin.
Ŕ ce propos.
Cette mission, c'est trčs risqué.
S'il n'y avait qu'une chance
de pouvoir faire sauter ce Relais
et de mettre fin ŕ la résurrection
de tous les Cylons pour toujours,
nous devons la saisir.
Je ne peux pas reculer.
Bien, Madame.
Si et quand D'Anna reviendra
d'entre les morts,
amenez-la moi.
Je pense que les Cylons s'imaginent
qu'elle sera interrogée
par les deux groupes en męme temps.
Je suis sűr que c'est le cas.
Amenez-la moi.
Elle connaît les noms
des 5 Cylons de notre flotte.
C'est une question
de sécurité humaine maintenant,
et je ne laisserai pas les Cylons
assister ŕ cette discussion.
Je veux lui parler seule ŕ seule.
Oui, Madame.
Bien.

Bienvenue ŕ la maison, D'Anna.
Tu m'avais dit
que je n'aurais plus ŕ subir ça.
J'ai menti.
Tu pensais me mettre
de côté pour toujours.
Alors qu'est-ce qui a changé ?
La guerre.
Une authentique guerre civile
entre Cylons.
Les numéro 1, 4 et 5,
contres les 2, 6 et 8
qui ont contesté ta mise au placard.
Maintenant tes fidčles travaillent
avec les humains
contre le reste d'entre nous.
En ton nom.
Boomer est une 8.
Ne devrait-elle pas
ętre de l'autre côté ?
Boomer est mon 8 domestique.
Elle a vu la voie de la raison.
Et une 8 peut faire
une alliée enthousiaste.
Jusqu'ŕ ce qu'elle y voit clair.
Quoi qu'il en soit,
pourquoi m'as-tu ramenée ?
Je t'ai ramenée pour
que tu nous rassembles, ma sśur,
et que tu mettes fin
ŕ cette guerre honteuse.
Vu que les pilotes Cylons
n'utilisent pas d'indicatifs,
nous allons peindre des codes
uniques sur tous leurs éclaireurs.
Quel soulagement.
Vous vous adressez ŕ eux,
utilisez ce nombre, ok ?
J'aurais dű lâcher
cette putain de mission.
Tout le monde, écoutez-moi.
Ces Raiders de combat ne
sont pas comme les autres.
Ils ne feront aucun faux
mouvement d'eux-męmes.
Ils sont sous le contrôle
de leurs pilotes.
Les pilotes Cylons sont
en charge de leurs éclaireurs.
Donc maintenant il y a
des mini-pilotes dedans ?
Nous faisons notre travail.
Notre formation est aussi bonne
que la vôtre.
Vraiment ?
Les vingt que j'ai descendus
n'étaient pas si bons.
Redwing.
Redwing !
Maintenant parlons
de l'élément de surprise.
La premičre vague de Vipers
va s'approcher,
moteurs, Dradis et
communications éteints, ok ?
Vous allez approcher, remorqués avec
des câbles, par les Raiders de combat.
- Nous les équipons en ce moment.
- Capitaine...
s'ils sont tous attachés
les uns aux autres,
collés ŕ leur culs ŕ proprement parler,
et qu'ils se mettent ŕ freiner,
on va s'exploser sur leurs arričres.
Ça n'arrivera pas.
Ça va marcher les gars.
Vraiment.
Quand vous serez assez proches,
le câble va se détacher.
Nous installons
des petits explosifs pour les couper.
Attendez, attendez.
Nous coupons le câble, pas vrai ?
Les pilotes Cylons coupent le câble.
Aprčs vous vous libérez
des éclaireurs et vous mettez les gaz.
Vous attaquerez directement
le PRL du Relais.
Ce sera un combat acharné
jusqu'aux frappes nucléaires.
Si les Cylons merdent,
nous sommes grillés, pas vrai ?
Écoutez, je suis sérieux.
Pilotes !
Vous avez déjŕ volé avec des Cylons.
Vous avez volé avec Athena.
Vous avez mis vos vies entre ses mains
et elle ne vous a pas trahis.
Je suis comme elle.
Tous ces Cylons ici, tous ces gens,
ce sont des pilotes, tout comme vous.
Et ils seront dans ce pétrin,
avec vous, tuant d'autres Cylons,
Tout comme Athena
quand on lui demande de le faire.
Et quand ce Relais sera détruit,
tous seront mortels.
Comme vous.
Donc vous devriez penser ŕ la façon
dont nous travaillerons ensemble.
Parce que sinon nous sommes tous morts.
A vos postes.
Allez-y demandez lui.
On m'a dit que vous aviez
parlé d'un Opéra,
- et je...
- ...car cela semble inutile.
Écoutez, il y avait un Opéra.
Un Opéra.
Est-ce que vous m'écoutez ?
Il semblerait que j'y étais.
J'ai eu une vision.
Je poursuivais une petite fille.
Je suis arrivée devant une porte,
j'ai vu le Dr Baltar et une 6
prendre l'enfant.
Elle n'écoute pas.
Protéger l'enfant.
Elle a dit "protéger l'enfant".
- C'est ce qu'a dit Caprica 6.
- Vous avez dit que je tenais l'enfant.
Donc j'étais celui
qui la protégeait, non ?
- Dans l'Opéra...
- Non.
Ce que vous faisiez
n'était pas trčs clair.
- Laissez-moi écouter.
- Démarrage.
Visiblement,
vous avez souvent fait ça.
Je fais la męme chose que vous.
En fait, non.
Ce n'est pas vrai.
Car si vous m'observiez,
Vous verriez que moi,
je me concentre sur elle.
Maintenant, dis-nous
ce qui c'est passé dans l'Opéra.
La seule chose
que vous faites c'est hurler.
Une telle forme
fermera les portes.
- Fermer les portes.
- Non, ouvrir les portes !
Je veux ouvrir les portes.
Faites le encore !
Je vais marcher.
- Faites mieux que moi.
- Je vais le faire.
Ouvrez la porte !
Trois !
La 3 est connectée.
- La 3 est connectée.
- La 3 est connectée ?
- La 3 est connectée !?
- Accčs au données.
- 3 est D'Anna.
- Chargement des données.
D'Anna est connectée.
D'Anna a un nouveau corps.
Démarrage.
Bond !
Pourquoi refait-on cela ?
Je n'ai pas envie de revoir cela.
Les Anciens disaient qu'un peuple est
aussi fort que le corps de son leader.
Si je vous suis bien,
vous dites que l'humanité va mourir
parce que je meurs ?
Si vous ętes mon subconscient,
vous ętes imbue de ma personne.
L'humanité ne va pas mourir
ŕ cause de vous.
Les Anciens se trompaient
sur beaucoup de choses.
Le corps du peuple n'est pas le męme
que celui de son leader.
Mais l'âme et l'esprit peuvent l'ętre.
D'accord, vous ne déposez
que la moralité ŕ mes pieds.
C'est bon.
Je peux le supporter.
Beaucoup de gens ont
des péchés pires que les miens.
Vous pensez ŕ Gaďus Baltar.
<i>Puis j'ai creusé la souche,</i>
<i>et retiré les pierres jusqu'ŕ
ce que mes doigts saignent.</i>
<i>J'ai ramassé les graines
des quelques fruits de l'île,</i>
<i>et je les ai plantées
en sillons droits et longs,</i>
<i>comme des rangées de soldats.</i>
<i>Quand j'eus terminé,
j'ai regardé ce que j'avais fait.</i>
<i>Je n'ai pas vu un jardin.</i>
<i>J'ai vu une cicatrice.</i>
<i>Cette île avait sauvé ma vie,
et je ne lui rendais pas la pareille</i>
Je peux voir une vraie hiérarchie
dans le coin.
Et il faut que je vous le dise,
vous ętes tout en bas de l'échelle,
mon ami.
Oui, tout en bas.
Ce qui est étrange
quand on pense au Dieu Cylon.
Ils vous ont parlé de Dieu,
n'est-ce pas ?
Je ne suis pas vraiment sűre
que l'Hybride
parlait de D'Anna,
mais si c'était le cas...
Ça rendrait les choses plus faciles.
Comment ça ?
Et bien nous n'aurions pas
ŕ lui trouver un corps.
Bien.
Trouvez-la et ramenez-la ici.
Autre chose ?
Une fois que vous aurez
ce qu'elle sait,
je ne peux pas m'empęcher de penser
que vous indiquerez le chemin
de la Terre aux seuls Humains.
Madame la Présidente,
cela ne me semble pas ...
Quoi ?
Honnęte.
Vous devez agir selon le pacte,
et ŕ la place vous
réquisitionnez D'Anna,
vous prenez ce qu'elle sait.
- Du calme, Capitaine.
Au mieux,
D'Anna connaît l'identité des Cylons
présents dans notre flotte,
et toujours au mieux,
ils savent comment atteindre la Terre.
Alors vous ne niez pas que
vous garderiez le chemin
de la Terre si vous le pouviez.
Je ne dis pas que c'est vrai.
Je dis juste que si les Cylons
en avaient l'occasion,
c'est exactement,
exactement ce qu'ils feraient.
Non, je ne le pense pas.
Non, pas les Sharon, les 8.
Capitaine ...
vous n'ętes pas marié
ŕ toute la chaîne de production.
Je ne peux pas me permettre d'ętre
sentimentale pour le moment.
Et je ne peux pas vous
le permettre non plus.
Si vous ne pouvez pas accomplir cette
mission, trouvez quelqu'un qui le fera.
C'est quoi ça ?
Je pense que nous y sommes.
Il se passe quelque chose.
Un autre vaisseau-mčre,
qui n'était pas prévu.
Vous devez parler aux 2, aux 8 et aux 6
et dites-leur qu'ils sont
allés trop loin.
Non.
Pourquoi ne demandez-vous pas
qui sont les 5 derniers ?
<i>Vous ne parlez jamais d'eux.</i>
Parce que je ne pense pas que
nous soyons censés les connaître.
Je vous le dirai.
Je crierai leurs noms.
Pourquoi prenez-vous ce risque ?
Allez-vous permettre de stopper
cette guerre, ou ętes-vous inutile ?
25 Raiders lourds viennent de quitter
le nouveau-venu et viennent vers nous.
Allez, commençons le covoiturage.
Maintenant !
Coupe ce putain de câble,
putain de bâtard !
Oh, l'inhibition a été enlevée.
Oh, je peux le sentir.
C'est le vaisseau-mčre rebelle.
Je pense qu'ils vont attaquer.
Ils vont détruire le Relais.
Ce serait un génocide.
La mort serait définitive
pour nous tous.
Ils sont devenus fous.
Une mort définitive ?
Et bien, cela rend ce geste
beaucoup plus sensé.
Helo, on a détruit leur PRL.
Ce Relais n'ira plus nulle part.
OK, on débarque.
Et bien, c'est aussi ton Dieu.
Et Dieu ne veut pas qu'une
de ses créations soit
une esclave.
Non pas que tu sois esclave.
Précisément.
Allez.
Cet endroit va sauter.
On doit y aller.
Courez !
Hardball, Pike.
Je suis touché.
Mon contrôle d'assiette est mort,
et mes putains de canons
ne répondent pas.
Pike, Hardball.
Mec, ne saute pas.
Tu atteindras pas le Galactica.
Tu sais combien de bonds il faut ?
Je décroche.
OK, je retourne au bercail.
Karl.
Allez, partons.
Allez !
Il y avait ce chien,
sur la truffe duquel
son maître avait placé
un bout de viande.
Et le chien devait attendre
qu'on lui permette de le manger.
Je sais. Pathétique.
Pathétique, n'est-ce pas ?
Mettez-le par ici.
Attendez.
Doucement Smith.
Doucement, doucement.
OK.
Allez voir ce qui se passe !
Oui, Madame.
- Merci.
- OK.
- Merci, merci.
- Bien.
Attendez.
OK.
Désolée.
Vous avez ce gros trou dans la peau,
comme dirait Cottle.
OK.
D'accord.
Je vais le refaire.
Merci.
C'est le moins que je puisse faire.
Je pense que vous allez vivre.
Comme d'habitude.
Vous savez quoi ?
Quoi ?
Vous ętes trčs mignonne.
Et bien, la morphine a agi vite.
Toujours.
Savez-vous pourquoi je suis si serein ?
Vous ętes shooté jusqu'aux yeux ?
Parce que je connais Dieu.
Vous avez besoin de Dieu, Laura.
Vraiment, vous seriez
une femme différente.
Je connais Dieu.
Donc, je me connais moi-męme.
En vérité,
Je nourrissais la culpabilité
la plus affreuse, la plus désespérée.
Une sombre, lourde,
inimaginable
et aliénante culpabilité.
Et elle a disparu.
Et elle a disparu. Elle...
s'est transformée en...
J'ai été transformé.
Pourquoi cette culpabilité ?
Je ne suis pas coupable.
Pourquoi cette culpabilité ?
J'ai donné les codes
d'accčs aux Cylons.
Ils ont quasiment balayé l'humanité.
Ce n'était pas exactement
ce que je croyais,
mais c'est ce que j'ai fait.
Et quand j'ai réalisé
la portée de mon acte,
ŕ cet instant męme,
j'ai été sauvé.
J'étais aimé.
Par Dieu.
En y repensant,
Je pense que j'ai été récompensé.
Récompensé.
La Pythie parle de l'inondation
qui a balayé l'humanité.
Personne ne blâme l'inondation.
Une inondation est une force naturelle
Par l'inondation, l'humanité
a été rajeunie, ressuscitée.
J'étais une autre inondation,
vous voyez.
Je m'en suis voulu.
Je m'en suis voulu.
Mais Dieu a créé l'homme
qui a fait ce choix.
Dieu nous a créés parfaits.
Et avec cette pensée,
toute ma culpabilité s'est envolée.
Envolée comme un oiseau.
Je peux vous donner cette paix Laura.
Cette liberté.
Priez avec moi.
Priez avec moi.
OK.
Merci.
OK.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
C'est bon.
Tout va bien.
Ne me faites pas ça.
Ne me faites pas ça, s'il vous plaît.
Nous avons D'Anna ŕ bord,
on s'est éloignés du vaisseau Relais.
Lancez la frappe nucléaire.
Je répčte,
feu vert pour la frappe nucléaire.
C'est ainsi que tous les Cylons
de l'Univers devinrent mortels.
Oui, c'est vrai.
Et c'est une bonne chose D'Anna.
Dorénavant
il n'y aura plus de différences.
On peut tous commencer
ŕ se faire confiance.
Ne me faites pas ça !
Ne me faites pas ça...
S'il vous plaît.
- S'il vous plaît...
- Non.
Je ne dis pas que Baltar
a fait plus de bien
que de mal ŕ l'univers.
Ce n'est pas le cas.
Le truc c'est...
que plus il est difficile d'accorder
le droit de vivre ŕ quelqu'un,
plus il est important de le faire.
Si l'humanité
pense qu'elle est digne de survivre,
elle ne peut le faire
en appliquant le cas par cas.
Les hommes mauvais ressentent
leur mort tout comme les hommes bons.
Qu'attendez-vous de moi ?
Laura.
Que vous aimiez quelqu'un.
L'amour...
Tu pars.
Ŕ présent tu peux reposer en paix.
Je ne serai plus égoďste.
Tu pars...
Repose en paix.
Non.
S'il vous plaît, non.
Arrętez de saigner...
Je dois le soigner.
Stopper l'hémorragie.
OK. Bien.
Ne partez pas...
On doit amener D'Anna
ŕ la salle de contrôle.
Ce n'est pas le plan.
Quoi ?
Quel plan ?
Intéressant.
S'il vous plaît, ne mourez pas...
Gaďus.
S'il vous plaît.
Je ne sais pas comment faire...
Ça va lŕ-dedans.
Je dois l'amener directement
ŕ la Présidente. Personne d'autre.
Ce n'était pas le marché.
Je dois juste faire
ce qu'elle m'a demandé.
Double jeu,
c'est trčs humain,
ne l'oublie jamais 8.
Non...
Ne partez plus...
Je vous en prie, ne mourez pas.
Tenez le coup.
Ne partez pas.
Cela ne veut pas dire
que je sois d'accord.
Cela veut dire que ce sont mes ordres.
Donc cela fait de moi une imbécile,
pas vrai ?
La confiance.
Peut-on aller voir la Présidente,
maintenant ?
Gaďus.
Gaďus, c'est moi.
Le vaisseau Relais a été détruit.
Bien.
Ne laissez personne entrer ici,
ŕ aucun prix.
Merci.
Son état est inquiétant,
mais je pense qu'il va survivre.
Je pense que le trajet
de retour va ętre long.
J'ai le temps.
Vraiment ?
Vous vous ętes donnée
beaucoup de mal pour m'amener ici.
En trompant vos soi-disant alliés.
Je suppose que vous avez
des questions ŕ me poser.
Oui, c'est le cas.
J'aimerais parler
des 5 Cylons dans ma flotte.
Alors vous savez pour les 5 derniers...
Je sais qu'ils sont censés
connaître le chemin de la Terre.
Mais vous ne savez pas,
que vous ętes l'une d'entre eux.
Si vous vous voyiez !
C'est ridicule,
je ne vous donnerai aucun nom,
pas tant que je ne serai pas
en sécurité,
parce que cette information, c'est
tout ce qu'il me reste ma chčre...
Je suis mortelle ŕ présent.
En fait, je suis la derničre 3
dans tout ce fichu univers.
Donc je dois penser ŕ me protéger.
Je vous dirai qui sont les 5 derniers,
quand vous m'aurez ramenée
dans votre flotte.
Au passage, Laura,
j'aurais dit la męme chose si vous
m'aviez récupérée avec un tas de Cylons,
car je n'ai plus confiance
en personne maintenant.
Alors tout cette mascarade,
n'est qu'une perte de temps.
Pour séparer la pompe du tuyau
attaché avec les câbles,
relâcher les trois languettes
simultanément
en tirant la pompe de son crochet
avec la ligne et les câbles...
Vous m'avez menti.
J'ai fait cela ?
Je pensais que j'avais gagné le droit
de survie pour l'humanité.
Ce n'est pas un
distributeur automatique Laura.
Vous ne sauvez pas une vie et puis
vous entendez les trompettes célestes
vous montrant le chemin de la Terre.
Je sais.
Bond.
Déconcertant, pas vrai ?
Tous ces petits pas en arričre.
J'aime ça.
J'y suis habituée.
Chaque bond nous ramčne
un peu plus vers chez nous.
Le Galactica.
Ma maison.
Peut-ętre qu'il y a
quelque chose pour moi lŕ-bas.
Peut-ętre
que c'est tout prčs.
Tu m'as manqué.
Toi aussi.
Je t'aime.
Il était temps.
Merci de votre patience,
de votre fidélité...
On se retrouve la semaine prochaine
pour...

TWELVE CYLON MODELS
SEVEN ARE KNOWN
FOUR LIVE IN SECRET
ONE WILL BE REVEALED
Previously on battlestar galactica.
the threes,the d'annas.
They were boxed after the battle on the algae planet.
why?
d'anna saw the faces of the final five.
But if we unbox her,she can reveal their identities to us.
the final five have been to earth.
If we help find them,they can help us get there.
so what could possibly motivate us to trust you now?
The boxing facility resides within the cylon resurrection hub.
This hub controls the functions of every resurrection ship.
You destroy the hub,cylons lose their ability to download.
the hybrid on the baseship spoke of an opera house and a dying leader.
We're going to talk to the hybrid.
And why would you require my presence?
Because you're in my visions.
president roslin was apparently aboard the cylon baseship,
along with gaius baltar and many of galactica's pilots when it jumped away.
Hub's gone.
We're getting radiation signatures from multiple nukes.
Baseship fragments.
The president's baseship was destroyed.
It's a different baseship.
waiting alone in a raptor as the rest of the fleet jump away,
well,that sounds a lot like suicide,dad.
Why are you doing this?
because I can't live without her.
TWO DAYS AGO
Plug it in.
I need to talk to it.
- Let god's will be done.
- Shut up.
It's time to get some answers.
Jump!
Elosha.
Oh,my gods.
filters.
- filters the sublime elevation.
- why did it jump?
Where are we?
- I'm more concerned about why we're here.
- Control.
filters.
why don't I talk to the hybrid?
Find out why.
She can just do that.
- She can just...
- jump!
Will you walk with me?
Galactica.
It...what's going on?
- It's empty.
- It is...
Feels bigger this way,doesn't it?
It's so quiet.
It's strange.
A lot of things are strange.

39,673 SURVIVORS
IN SEARCH OF A HOME
CALLED EARTH
Battlestar Galactica
Season4 Episode09
wing beats of a dove drown out the heartbeats of those who follow.
Six is back in the stream.
That's unusual.
To jump again so quickly.
What do you think it means?
Look,it knows me.
It trusts me.
I think.
I think it even likes me,'cause I...
you're getting information from this liquid?
The hybrid is disorganized.It's panicking.
I don't know why.
Tell me.
Why are you jumping the ship?
The six.
The six who went among the makers is no longer.
End of line.
Back in the stream that feeds the ocean that feeds the stream.
the six.
She means natalie,the six who was our leader.
She's either been hurt or killed back on galactica.
That's why the hybrid's panicking.
So she's upset.
Okay,fine.
Can you.
calm her down?Can you tell her to jump back?
It doesn't work like that.
She makes her own decisions.
And we can't unplug her because now she's wired herself into life support.
All right,then why don't we give this a go?
Hey.
Hey,stop jumping the ship,all right?
Calm your mind.
Cease countdown,cease countdown.
Circulation,ventilation,control.
Filters.
- filters.the sublime elevation
- did you see that?
I just opened myself up to it
- on a spiritual level...
- jump!
Don't you just hate these people?
no.
Oh,but you don't love them either.
The people in this room are the closest thing you've got to family,and you.
you've been their president.
Watch them try to comfort each other.
At least you haven't taken that away from them.
yet.
You didn't rob them of their empathy.
yet.
You just don't make room for people anymore.
You don't love people.
Is that clear enough?
Practical enough for you,madam president?
I think we're going towards the resurrection hub.
I think the mission is still on.
You sure there's no eta at the hub?
No,the hub is jumping and our hybrid's jumping after it.
Sometimes we're showing up six hours after it's moved on.
Sometimes,like,six minutes.
And one time it'll be within one jump-length and we'll catch it.
Yeah,but we don't know when.
So we'll have to assume that any jump could be the one that just drops us in next to it.
They're gonna read our heat signatures the second we fire up the first viper.
Hell,they'll read our electronics.
Yeah,if we could only mask that.
Go in cold.
No electronics at all.
We'll send the vipers out dead,towed by cylon birds.
They'll never see it coming.
Take out the hub's jump drive,then settle in for the long fight.
Yeah,good,okay,okay.
But you and me,we've got to get onto the hub
in the middle of that mess and try to find d'anna.
We can do this.
No,I-I don't know.
It's crazy,isn't it?
We're putting ourselves right where the action is.
It's not a great plan.
There's no time.
Hey,let me help you.
Athena,my wife,she learned to do that.
She never did that when I met her.
What?
I got curious about athena.
About her and hera and you.
So I accessed her.
her memories from her last download.
You have her memories.
Yeah,and they're mine now too.
They're as real as my own.
I know this must feel like a violation of trust or something,
but I don't... I don't want it to be strange,okay?
Right.
Right,sure.
Madam president?
Sir?
Hope I didn't wake you.
Uh,come in.
Thank you for the use of your...your raptor.
I needed some familiar surroundings.
Don't worry.I'll give it back to lt.
Pike the second you need it.
About that.
This mission,it's very risky.
If there's even a chance that we can go in and blow up
that hub and end cylon resurrection for all cylons forever,
we must take it.
I cannot back away from that.
Yes,sir.
If and when d'anna comes back from the dead,bring her to me.
I think the cylons think that she'll be interrogated by both groups together.
I'm sure they do.
Bring her to me.
She knows the identities of the five cylons in our fleet.
It is a matter now of human security,
and I will not let the cylons have audience to that discussion.
I want to talk to her alone.
Yes,sir.
Good.
RESURRECTION HUB
welcome home,d'anna.
You told me I'd never have to go through this again.
I lied.
You thought you were putting me away forever.
So what changed?
War.
A genuine cylon civil war.
Ones and fours and fives against twos and sixes and eights
that objected to your retirement.
Now your supporters are working with humans against all the rest of us.
All in your name.
Boomer's an eight.
Shouldn't she be on the other side?
Boomer's my pet eight.
She's seen the light of reason.
And an eight can make a passionate ally.
Till she sees something shiny.
Why'd you bring me back anyway?
I brought you back to heal us,sister,and end this shameful war.
Since cylon pilots don't use call signs,
we're gonna be painting unique identifiers on all their birds.
That's a relief.
you address them,use that number,okay?
Should've scrubbed this frakkin' mission.
Hey,everyone,listen up.
Now these heavy raiders aren't like the other raiders.
They aren't gonna make any hinky moves on their own.
They're under the control of their pilots.
The cylon pilots are in charge of their birds.
Oh,now there are tiny pilots inside of them?
We do our jobs.
Training is just as good as yours.
oh,yeah?
Twenty-some of you I've taken out weren't that good.
redwing.
Redwing!
Now let's talk about the surprise element.
First wave of vipers are gonna ride in,engines cold,dradis and comm off,okay?
You're gonna come in towed by cables from the heavy raiders.
- We're rigging 'em up now.
- Captain,don't...
now,I mean,if they're all tied together here,
kissing their gasholes so to speak,
and they tap on the brakes,
we're gonna smash right in the back of them.
They won'T.
It'll work,you guys.Really.
When you're close enough,the cable's gonna disconnect.
We're mounting small explosive charges to cut it.
Hold it,hold it.
We cut the cable,right?
Cylon pilots cut the cable.
Then you sling out of their birds and you turn your power on.
You're gonna be gunning directly at the hub's ftl.
Then it's an all-out fight until we can get in there with the nukes.
Yeah,so if the cylons don't lift up,and then we're toast,right?
No,look,I'm serious.
Hey,hey!
Pilots!
You've flown with cylons.
You've flown with athena.
You put your life in her hands and she hasn't betrayed you.
Well,I am the same as her.
Now all of these cylons here,all of these people,they're pilots like you.
And they're gonna be out in the soup with you taking out other cylons,
just like athena does every time she's asked to.
And when that hub is taken out,all of their lives will be at risk.
Just like yours.
So you might want to think about how you're gonna work together.
Because we're all dead if you don'T.
moving on.
just go and ask it already.
I've been told that you said something about an opera house,
- and I...
- because it seems pointless.
Look,there was an opera house.
An opera house.
Are you listening to me?
Apparently I was in the opera house.
I had a vision.
I was chasing after a little girl.
I came to a door.
I saw dr.Baltar and the six take the child.
She's not listening.
"Protect the child.
" She said,"protect the child.
" That's what caprica said.
You told me I was the one holding the child,
so obviously I was the one protecting the child,wasn't I?
- In the opera house...
- no,no,no.
It wasn't at all clear what you were doing.
Let me listen.
Booting up.
I mean,obviously you've done this a thousand times before.
Well,I'm just doing the same thing you're doing.
No,you're not actually.
No,you're not.
Because if you'll watch what I'm doing,
what I'm doing is I'm actually focusing on her,all right?
Now tell us what happened in the opera house now,all right?
Oh,the only thing you're doing is yelling.
Such a format will close the doors.
Close the door.No,no,open the door.Open the door.
I want to open the door!
Do it again,do it again,do it again!
I'm going for a walk.
Love to see you do any better.
All right,I'll do it.
Open the door!
Three!
The three is online.
The three is online.
The three is online.
The three is online.
- Accessing data.
- The three is d'anna.
Loading data.
D'anna is online.
Oh,d'anna's in a body.
D'anna's back in a body.
Booting up...jump!
why are we doing this again?
I don't want to see this again.
The ancients used to say "a people is only as strong as the body of its leader."
If I follow that thought,are you saying that humanity died because I died?
If you're my subconscious,I've gotta say you're a little full of myself.
Humanity didn't die because you did.
The ancients,they got a lot of things wrong.
The body of a people is not the same as the body of its leader.
But the soul and the spirit might be.
Oh,I see,so you're only laying morality at my feet.
Well,that's okay.
I can take that.
I mean,there are a lot of people who have sins far greater than mine.
You're thinking of gaius baltar.
"then I dug "into the stump and pulled rocks from the ground "until my fingers bled. "
I collected seeds from the few fruits "the island offered,"
and planted them in long,straight furrows,"like the ranks of soldiers.
"When I finished,I looked at what I had done."
I did not see a garden.
I saw a scar.
"This island had saved my life,and I had done it no service."
I can see a real hierarchy around here.
And I have to tell you,you're on the lower end of the scale,my friend.
Yes,you are.
Which is odd when you think about the cylon god...
they told you about god,didn't they?
I'm not even really sure if the hybrid was referring to d'anna,but if it's true.
it certainly would make it easier.
How so?
Well,we.
wouldn't have to find A.
find a body.
Yes,good.
Okay.
Go get her and bring her here.
Something else?
It's just once you have what she knows,
I can't help feeling like you could try to keep earth for humans only.
And I just... madam president,that doesn't seem...
what?
Honest.
You're supposed to be conducting a fair deal here,
and instead you're taking d'anna off by yourself.
Taking what she knows.
Slow down,captain.
At best,d'anna knows conoce the identities of the cylons in our fleet.
And at best,they know a way to earth.
So you're not denying you'd keep the way to earth to yourself if you could.
I'm not saying that's true.
I will say that if the cylons had the option,that's exactly,exactly what they would do.
No,I don't think so.
Not the sharons,the eights.
Captain.
you are not married to the entire production line.
I cannot afford to be sentimental right now,
and I cannot afford you to be sentimental either.
If you can't do this job,find me someone who can.
What is that?
I think we're there.
Something's going on.
Another baseship,unscheduled.
You've gotta speak to the twos and sixes and eights and tell them they've gone too far.
No.
Why don't you ask about the final five?
You never ask about them.
That's because I don't believe we're meant to know them.
Well,I'll tell you.
I will tell you.
I'll start shouting out their names.
Why do you risk it?
Are you going to help end this war or are you useless?
25 heavy raiders just launched from the new arrival,heading our way.
Come on,let's get this carpool started.
Now!
Cut the frakkin' cable now,you frakkin' bastard!
Oh,the inhibition's been lifted.
Oh,I sense it.
It's the rebel baseship.
I think they're gonna attack.
They're gonna blow the hub.
That would be mass murder.
Death would be permanent for all of us.
They've gone insane.
Permanent death?
Well,that makes this all the more meaningful.
Helo,we've blown their ftl.
That hub's not going anywhere.
Okay,take us down.
Well,he's your god as well.
And god doesn't want any of his creations to be.
slaves.
Not that you're a slave.
exactly.
Go.
This place is gonna go.
Grab her.
Run!
Hardball,pike.I'm hit.
My attitude control is down,and I can't even program any frakkin' ordnance.
Pike,hardball.
Man,don't jump.
You'll never make it to galactica.
You know how many jumps that is?
I'm out of here.
Okay,I'm jumping back home.
Karl.
come on,let's go.
Go!
there was this dog,see,and the master had placed a bit of food on the edge of its snout.
And the dog had to wait until he was told he could eat it.
I know.Pathetic.Pathetic,isn't it?
Put him over there.
Wait.
Easy,smith.Easy,easy.
Okay.
Find out what's going on!
Yes,sir.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
- Thank you,thank you.
- Good.
Okay,wait.
Okay.
Sorry.
You have this...you have this big hole in your hide,as cottle would say.
Okay.
All right.
I'm gonna do this again.
Thank you.
It's the least I can do.
I think you're gonna live.
as usual.
You know something?
What?
You're very pretty.
Man,that morpha worked fast.
Still.
Do you know why I'm so serene right now?
You're doped out of your mind?
Because I know god.
You need god,laura.
Really,you'd be a different woman.
I know god.
Therefore,I know myself.
Truth is.
I was harboring the most awful,desperate guilt.
A heavy,dark.
unimaginable.
soul-breaking guilt.
Now it's gone.
Now it's gone,it'S.
been transformed into...
I have been transformed.
What was your guilt about?
I have no guilt.
What was your guilt about?
I gave the access codes to the cylons.
They wiped out most of humanity.
Of course,I didn't know that's what I was doing at the time exactly,
but that's what I did.
And when I realized what I had done,the magnitude.
in that moment,I was saved.
I was loved.
by god.
Looking back.
I think I was rewarded.
Rewarded.
Pythia talks about the flood that wiped out most of humanity.
Nobody blames the flood.
A flood is a force of nature.
Through the flood,mankind is rejuvenated,born again.
I was another flood,you see.
I blamed myself.
I blamed myself.
But god made the man that made that choice.
God made us all perfect.
And in that thought,all my guilt flies away.
flies away like a bird.
I can give you that peace,laura,that freedom.
Pray with me.
Pray with me.
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
It's all right.
You're fine.
Don't do this to me.
Don't do this to me,please.
We have d'anna on board.
We are clear of the hub.
Commence nuclear strike.
Repeat,nuclear strike is a go.
And with a whimper,every cylon in the universe begins to die.
yes,that's right.
And it's a good thing,d'anna.
Na because now there's no difference.
We can all start trusting each other.
Don't do this to me.
Don't...don't do this to me.
Don't do this to me,please.
Please.
No.
I'm not saying baltar's done more good than harm in the universe.
He hasn'T.
The thing is,the harder it is to recognize someone's right to draw breath,
the more crucial it is.
If humanity is going to prove itself worthy of surviving,
it can't do it on a case-by-case basis.
A bad man feels his death just as keenly as a good man.
what do you want from me here?
Laura.
Just love someone.
Love.
You go.
You go.
You go to your rest now.
I'm not gonna be selfish anymore.
You go.
Rest.
No.
No,please,no.
Stop bleeding.
Stop the bleeding,stop the bleeding.
Okay,good.
Don't go.
All right,we've gotta get d'anna to the control room.
Nano,that's not the plan.
What?
What plan?
Interesting.
Please don't go,gaius.
Please.
I don't know how... all right,put it in.
I have to take her directly to the president.
No one else.
That wasn't the deal.
I'm just doing what she told me to do,okay?
double dealing.
It's very human.
You never got that,eight.
No more.
No more,don't go.
Please don't die.
Live,please.Don't go.
I'm not saying I agree.
I'm saying it's my orders.
So I pretty much just made a prize fool of myself,didn't I?
Trust.
can we go find the president now?
Gaius?
Gaius,it's me.
The hub's been destroyed.
Good.
Don't let anyone in here.
Whatever it takes.
Thank you.
He's injured,but I think he's going to survive.
I think it's gonna be a long time jumping back.
I've got time.
Is that right?
Well,you went to a lot of trouble to bring me here.
Deceiving your so-called allies.
I suppose you've got some questions for me.
Yes,I do.
I'd like to talk about the five cylons in my fleet.
So you know about the final five.
I know they're supposed to know the way to earth.
But you don't know that you're one of them?
Your face!
Oh,it's ridiculous!
No,look,I'm not giving you any names.
Not until I feel like I'm safe.
'Cause information is all I got,sweetie.
I'm mortal now.
In fact,I'm the only three in the whole darn universe.
So I gotta worry about protecting myself.
I'll tell you who the final five are when you take me back to your fleet.
Oh,and by the way,laura,I would've said the same thing
if you'd have met me with a whole lot of cylons,
'cause I don't trust anyone right now.
So all this deception,complete waste of time.
To remove the pump with the attached hose and wiring,
simultaneously release the three tangs
while pulling the pump out of the retainer along with the line and wiring.
You lied to me.
Did I?
I thought I was earning humanity's right to survive.
It's not a vending machine,laura.
You don't save a life,and then...
cue the celestial trumpets... here's the way to earth.
I know.
Jump!
Disorienting,isn't it?
All these little limping steps back.
I like it.
I'm used to it.
Every jump brings us a little bit closer to home.
Galactica.
My home.
Maybe there's something there for me.
Maybe even closer.
Missed you.
Me too.
I love you.
About time.

12 MODČLES CYLONS
7 SONT CONNUS
4 VIVENT EN SECRET
LE DERNIER SERA RÉVÉLÉ
<i>Précédemment dans
Battlestar Galactica...</i>
Je viens de finir de contrôler
le Viper de Starbuck.
On dirait que ce truc sort de l'usine.
Il est temps d'avoir des réponses.
Rebranchez-la.
Bond !
Apparemment, la Présidente Roslin,
accompagnée de Gaďus Baltar
et d'un groupe de pilotes,
se trouvait sur le vaisseau-mčre
qui a sauté.
Attendre seul dans un Raptor,
alors que la flotte fait un bond,
cela ressemble ŕ un suicide, papa.
- Pourquoi fais-tu cela ?
- Parce que je ne peux vivre sans elle.
<i>Nous avons D'Anna ŕ bord,
on s'est éloignés du vaisseau Relais.</i>
<i>Lancez la frappe nucléaire.</i>
Alors vous savez pour les 5 derniers.
Je sais qu'ils sont censés
connaître le chemin de la Terre.
Je dois penser ŕ me protéger.
Je vous le dirai
quand je retournerai dans votre flotte.
Je t'aime.
Il était temps.
Bonjour, M. le Président...
On m'a dit que tu étais ici.
Le Temple d'Aurora.
Sur la Terre.
Du moins comme le décrit la Pythie.
Nous y arriverons.
Nous y marcherons ensemble.
Ouais, c'est bien de le penser.
Ce sont les affaires de Roslin ?
C'est étrange de ne pas la voir ici.
Personne ne s'est assis sur sa chaise.
Tigh ne peut męme pas la regarder.
Le truc le plus effrayant qu'utilisait
ma mčre quand j'étais enfant :
"Ton pčre t'attend ŕ son bureau."
Je frappais ŕ la porte...
Je franchissais toute la pičce...
jusqu'ŕ ce bureau.
Leoben m'a dit quelque chose
quand il me retenait prisonničre dans
cette maison de poupée sur New Caprica.
Les enfants naissent
pour remplacer leurs parents.
Pour que les enfants atteignent
leur plein potentiel,
leurs parents doivent mourir.
Nous rattraperons votre flotte
dans moins d'une heure.
Alors nous vous enverrons
vos cinq derniers.
Quatre.
Il y en a 4 dans votre flotte.
Quatre...
Oů est le cinquičme ?
Je veux les 4 de votre flotte.
Ce serait plus facile
si vous nous disiez qui ils sont.
Plus facile pour les tuer.
Pourquoi ferions-nous cela ?
Ils connaissent le chemin de la Terre.
Nous avons besoin d'eux.
Elle a raison. Nous voulons tous
la męme chose. Si nous coopérions...
Nous l'avons fait sur New Caprica,
frčre.
Ça n'a pas trčs bien marché.
Je vais garder vos hommes en otages
jusqu'ŕ ce que les 4 soient
en sécurité sur ce vaisseau.
Vous devez baisser les armes, Bill.
Allons.
Faites-moi confiance.
Baissez les armes.
Passez le mot aux autres.
Rassemblez l'équipage.
Il y a déjŕ des 8
qui préparent un Raptor.
Nous partirons
dčs que le bond sera fait.
Et Amiral...
vous viendrez avec moi
sur le Galactica.
- Je n'irai pas.
- Bill, allez-y.
Si les Cylons obtiennent les 4,
ils iront sur Terre...
Ça ne doit pas arriver,
męme si tu dois détruire ce vaisseau.
Et merde !
Je te l'attrape, Félix.
Merci.
M. Gaeta,
souhaitez-vous ętre remplacé ?
Tout va bien.
Contact Dradis !
En approche, cap 1-8-5
inclinaison 2-9-9 ŕ 1700.
- Qu'avons-nous ?
- Vaisseau-mčre Cylon.
Nouveau contact, męmes coordonnées.
C'est un Raptor.
Les nôtres sont de retour, Monsieur.
Peut-ętre qu'elle ne pourra pas
nous identifier.
C'est bon de te revoir ici.
C'est bon de revenir chez soi.
La bonne nouvelle est
que Laura Roslin est vivante
et en bonne santé,
ainsi que vos collčgues.
Elle veut les 4 Cylons qui se trouvent
dans cette flotte.
Elle détient nos hommes en otage
jusqu'ŕ ce qu'elle les obtienne.
Vous ne devez rien faire,
excepté rester ŕ l'écart.
Je suis déjŕ en contact avec eux.
Maintenant, ils savent
qu'ils n'ont rien ŕ craindre
que nous voulons seulement
les aimer et les protéger,
ils trouveront un moyen
de nous rejoindre.
Je vous demande juste de ne pas bloquer
les navettes de la flotte.
Donc votre plan est de prendre
les 4 Cylons et de rejoindre
la Terre sans nous ?
- Cela dépend d'eux.
Trčs bien.
Si ces 4 Cylons
veulent vous suivre,
ils sont libres de le faire.
Je ne les arręterai pas.
Ętes-vous d'accord avec ça, Amiral ?
D'accord.
Je les attendrai sur le vaisseau-mčre.
Laura Roslin
a besoin de ses médicaments.
Et j'ai besoin de savoir
si elle va bien.
- Je pars avec eux.
- Non !
Nous ne pouvons leur donner
d'autres otages.
Le Colonel a raison.
J'ai travaillé pour Roslin
pendant 2 ans.
Ma place est ŕ ses côtés.
Un otage de plus ne changera rien.
- Trčs bien, allez-y.
- Merci.
J'ai joué ton jeu,
on fait quoi maintenant ?
Starbuck va préparer un plan
pour libérer nos hommes par la force.
Si nous n'empęchons pas les Cylons
d'atteindre le vaisseau-mčre,
Laura Roslin veut
qu'il soit détruit.
La moitié de nos hommes est lŕ-bas.
C'est votre décision, M. le Président.
Roslin a raison.
Si nous perdons les 4,
nous perdons la Terre.
Si ça tourne mal,
nous détruirons le vaisseau-mčre
et tous ceux qui y sont.

Bon épisode ŕ tous...
Donc les prisonniers étaient lŕ,
mais D'Anna doit savoir
que vous m'avez confiée ça.
{\pos(192,220)}Si elle a déplacé les prisonniers,
il faudra se battre pičce par pičce.
{\pos(192,220)}Et s'ils ouvrent le feu sur la flotte
pendant que nous les abordons ?
{\pos(192,220)}Ils pourraient effacer définitivement
la race humaine du tableau.
On doit donc s'assurer que nos Raptors
soient sur place avec les bombes
nucléaires parées et verrouillées.
{\pos(192,220)}Il doit y avoir d'autres options.
{\pos(192,220)}Oui, que ces 4 foutus Cylons
se rendent d'eux-męmes.
{\pos(192,220)}Mes frčres et sśurs,
c'est un grand jour pour nous.
{\pos(192,220)}L'un de nos enfants égarés
vient de rentrer.
{\pos(192,220)}C'est l'une des 5 derniers ?
{\pos(192,210)}Je l'ai vue dans ma vision.
Et ŕ présent, elle est chez elle.
Laura.
Il y a quelque chose
que je souhaiterais vous dire.
Je voulais vous remercier.
Pourquoi ça ?
{\pos(192,210)}Principalement,
pour ne pas m'avoir tué.
{\pos(192,210)}Ça n'a pas dű ętre
une décision facile ŕ prendre.
{\pos(192,210)}Mais j'aime vivre.
J'aime vivre,
et je voulais vous remercier
pour m'avoir sauvé.
{\pos(192,210)}Je ne serais pas...
{\pos(192,210)}si reconnaissante ŕ votre place.
{\pos(192,210)}Vous devez savoir que j'ai dit
ŕ l'Amiral que si D'Anna ne cédait pas,
il devrait réduire
ce vaisseau en miettes.
Quoi ?
Elle est ici.
{\pos(192,210)}Madame la Présidente.
{\pos(192,210)}Gaďus.
Tory.
Asseyez-vous.
Je vous ai amené votre traitement.
Par les dieux !
{\pos(192,210)}Comment avez-vous fait ça ?
{\pos(192,210)}Je suis revenue avec D'Anna.
Pour ętre avec les miens.
Car vous ętes l'une des 5.
Vous ętes une des 5 derniers.
{\pos(192,210)}D'Anna l'a vue.
Dans une vision.
J'en étais sűr.
Peut-ętre pas consciemment,
{\pos(192,170)}mais dans mon subconscient,
j'ai toujours suspecté quelque chose.
{\pos(192,280)}Vous n'en saviez rien.
N'est-ce pas ?
Non.
Vous devriez vous demander sur quoi
d'autre vous vous ętes trompée.
Tory, attendez.
Vous avez raison.
J'ai tort.
Ok.
{\pos(192,210)}Vous ętes l'une des 5 derniers vénérés,
{\pos(192,210)}et en tant que tel,
les Cylons vous écouteront.
Est-ce que j'ai tort ?
Alors Tory, s'il vous plaît,
allez voir D'Anna,
et...
essayez de la convaincre de se rendre
et de relâcher tous les otages.
Je ne reçois plus d'ordres de vous.
<i>M. le Président,
il y a un changement de plan.</i>
<i>Je viens d'exécuter
le premier des otages coloniaux.</i>
Un autre suivra tous les quarts d'heure
jusqu'ŕ ce que
les nôtres rentrent chez eux.
Trčs bien, écoutez-moi.
Vous ne nous donnez aucune chance.
Nous coopérons !
Elle a coupé la communication.
Trčs bien Amiral, vous avez le feu
vert pour la mission de sauvetage.
Si elle échoue,
détruisez le vaisseau-mčre.
Bien, M. le Président.
Allez, mettez ces pilotes
dans leurs cockpits.
Vérifiez tous les systčmes, et mettons
ces oiseaux dans leurs tubes.
C'est bon Chef.
On y est.
Les moteurs d'Apu ne démarrent pas.
Ça ne devrait pas ętre long, je veux
bien ętre damné si je ne trouve pas.
Mais j'ai mis quelques gars dessus...
Galen, vous m'écoutez ?
Vous savez qu'il y a un vaisseau-mčre
dehors avec les nôtres ŕ son bord.
Notre boulot est de les ramener en vie.
La rapidité est notre seul avantage.
Ils ne s'attendent peut-ętre pas
ŕ un assaut,
donc, męme s'ils sont trčs rapides,
nous devrons l'ętre encore plus qu'eux.
La formation des Raptors 2 et 6
sous les ordres d'Athena,
sera notre force de frappe.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Je l'entends ŕ nouveau.
D'accord.
L'un de vous a une putain d'idée
sur ce que nous faisons ici ?
Je ne sais pas, j'ai juste été attiré.
Quelque chose au sujet de ce Viper.
Comme quoi ?
Vous avez vérifié chaque foutu morceau
de cet oiseau
sans trouver quoi que ce soit.
Oui, mais quelque
chose nous a amené ici.
Quelque chose a changé.
Męme si je ne sais pas ce que c'est.
Kara pourrait nous aider.
Elle a fait l'aller-retour
jusqu'ŕ la Terre lŕ-dedans.
Trouvez-la. Voyez si elle peut
vous en dire plus.
Mais dépęchez-vous.
Ou des tas de gens biens vont mourir.
Et oů allez-vous ?
Bill, tu dois reconsidérer
cette mission.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ici ?
Tu es censé ętre sur la passerelle.
Les Cylons vont tuer
tous leurs foutus otages
avant que nous ayons posé
la moindre botte sur leur vaisseau.
Laura Roslin sera la prochaine
ŕ mourir, Bill.
Je cherche des options.
Tu en as une ?
Ouais.
J'aurais dű t'en parler
quand j'ai eu le déclic,
mais je n'ai pas eu les tripes.
Qu'est-ce qui cloche avec toi Saul ?
Souviens-toi, la nébuleuse,
quand je t'ai parlé
de cette putain de musique.
Je pensais qu'elle venait du vaisseau.
J'avais tort.
C'était un signal.
Un genre de putain de signal Cylon...
m'a activé.
Je ne peux pas l'arręter.
Il t'a activé.
Comme Boomer.
Je fais partie des cinq.
Les cinq.
Un des Cylons que D'Anna recherche.
Arręte de me prendre pour un con.
Colonel, je te connais depuis 30 ans.
Je te l'ai dit.
Je n'ai eu le déclic
que dans la nébuleuse.
Réfléchis ŕ ça.
Quand on s'est rencontrés,
tu avais des cheveux.
Je n'ai jamais entendu dire
que les Cylons vieillissaient.
Ça ne signifie rien.
Avant l'attaque des Colonies,
nous ne connaissions pas
l'existence des synthétiques.
Il y a sans doute
d'autres modčles Cylons
que nous ne connaissions pas,
et je suis l'un d'eux.
Sur New Caprica, tu...
as été fait prisonnier.
Ils t'ont fait quelque chose.
Ils... un implant,
une suggestion post-hypnotique
qui te fait penser ça.
Allons parler au Dr Cottle.
Écoute-moi !
Ce n'est pas du délire.
Ce n'est pas une puce dans ma tęte.
Je suis un Cylon.
Je vous trompe
depuis des mois maintenant.
Je ne voulais pas, mais je l'ai fait.
Enlčve tes mains.
Si j'avais eu les tripes de me jeter
par le sas quand j'ai réalisé,
on ne serait pas dans ce bazar.
Mais c'est un fait.
Pas cette attaque suicide.
Je suis l'un des 5 derniers.
D'Anna fera machine arričre,
si tu menaces de me jeter par le sas.
Papa, papa.
Papa, écoute.
Personne n'a deviné.
Personne.
Pas avec cet enregistrement,
ce qu'il a fait sur New Caprica.
Son śil, ce qui est arrivé ŕ sa femme…
Allez, on se relčve.
Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?
Tous ceux...
que j'ai envoyés ŕ la mort.
Dans quel but ?
Dans quel but ?
Pour la Terre.
Il n'y a pas de Terre.
C'est une putain de blague.
Il n'y a pas de Terre.
Ok, papa, écoute-moi.
Écoute-moi !
Reprends-toi.
- Je ne peux pas.
- Si, tu peux, allez.
- Je ne peux pas.
- Si, tu peux.
Je ne peux pas...
Je ne peux pas le tuer.
Je ne peux pas tuer ce bâtard.
Je ne peux pas.
- Ok, ok, papa.
- Je ne peux pas.
Tout... tout va bien se passer.
Tout va bien se passer.
Je... je vais m'en occuper.
Je ne peux pas.
Je vais m'en occuper.
Fils de pute.
Qui sont les autres ?
Oů est le vieux ?
Juste oů tu l'as laissé.
M. le Président, c'est la passerelle.
D'Anna est en ligne.
Ici le Président.
M. le Président.
Vous perdez du temps.
Non, vous perdez du temps.
Ŕ votre tour d'écouter.
Si vous vous en prenez
encore ŕ mon peuple,
męme pour un śil au beurre noir,
j'éjecte Saul Tigh
par un tube ŕ torpilles.
Nous ne voulons plus
d'effusions de sang.
Puis-je parler ŕ l'Amiral ?
Non, vous négociez avec moi.
Vous avez 10 minutes
pour libérer mon peuple
ou vous pouvez dire adieu
ŕ un de vos précieux 5 derniers.
Vous voulez sauver la flotte,
j'ai besoin des autres, tout de suite.
Il est posé lŕ de la męme maničre
depuis des mois.
Qu'est-ce qui peut te faire penser
que quelque chose a changé ?
Difficile ŕ expliquer.
Tu sais, c'est juste une impression.
Ouais, j'ai eu cette impression aussi.
Vous ętes tous les deux ŕ côté
de vos pompes.
Tu as eu l'impression
de pouvoir trouver la Terre.
Je t'ai fait confiance.
Je t'ai toujours soutenue.
Lŕ, j'ai besoin
que tu nous fasses confiance.
Enseigne Anders.
Spécialiste Tyrol.
Mettez lentement vos mains sur la tęte
et retournez-vous face au Viper.
Exécution !
Qu'est-ce qui se passe, bon sang ?
Ce sont des Cylons,
tout comme le second.
Sam.
Vas-y.
C'est la vérité Kara.
Il y a quelque chose de différent
sur ce Viper.
Quelque chose a changé.
<i>- Il faut que tu le trouves.
- Ta gueule.</i>
Reculez !
Reculez !
Oů nous amenez-vous bon sang ?
Continuez de bouger,
sinon on vous abat sur place.
Non !
Facile ŕ deviner.
Vous leur avez dit.
Nous aurions dű le faire
dčs le premier jour.
Rappelez le vaisseau-mčre.
M. Hoshi,
il nous faut le vaisseau-mčre.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
- D'Anna va...
exécuter d'autres otages.
Amenez-moi ŕ D'Anna.
Non, elle ne vous écoutera pas.
J'étais dans le temple avec elle
quand elle a eu la vision
sur les 5... Emmenez-moi.
Il a raison.
Emmenez-le, c'est bon.
Ętes-vous capable de vous raisonner,
M. le Président ?
Galen Tyrol et Samuel Anders
viennent de rejoindre
Saul Tigh dans le sas.
Ils les ont trouvés.
Ils sont pręts ŕ faire
un tour dans l'espace.
Vous les voulez vivants, retirez-vous.
Je connais Lee.
Mets-lui la pression et il capitulera.
Ciblez nos armes nucléaires
sur la flotte civile.
On va voir s'il veut jouer les durs.
D'Anna.
Gaius.
Mettre la pression ne marchera pas
avec Lee Adama.
Il ressemble trop ŕ son pčre.
Lee bluffe.
Il se fout complčtement
de ces trois-lŕ.
Plus maintenant.
Poussez-le ŕ bout et il les tuera.
La race humaine au complet
mourra avec eux, alors.
M. le Président, les armes nucléaires
du vaisseau viennent d'ętre chargées.
Si un seul de nos vaisseaux
tente de partir...
Ils n'auront pas le temps de faire
un bond avant que les Cylons ne tirent.
Sergent Harder,
sortez-les tous sauf Tigh.
Caporal.
Penses-tu vraiment que Dieu t'a ramenée
des ténčbres pour ça, D'Anna ?
Peut-ętre qu'il t'a ramenée
dans un but différent.
Pour y mettre fin pacifiquement.
Ils ne nous pardonneront jamais
ce qu'on a fait aux 12 Colonies.
Jamais.
<i>Continuez.</i>
La force n'a pas fonctionné
sur New Caprica.
Elle n'a pas fonctionné
sur la plančte des algues.
Alors pourquoi fonctionnerait-elle ici ?
Donne-moi la clé.
Nos armes sont verrouillées
sur leurs vaisseaux.
Qu'est-ce que tu attends Apollo ?
Fais-le.
Lee, arręte !
Stop, stop !
Ces 3 fichus Cylons viennent
de nous donner la direction de la Terre.
C'est le signal colonial
d'un localisateur d'urgence.
Et aucun autre récepteur
de la flotte ne le reçoit ?
Gaeta l'a confirmé.
Le canal est vide sauf sur ce Viper.
C'est forcément un signal de la Terre.
Tu es atteinte, Kara.
Allez Lee, réfléchis.
Je disparais dans une tempęte.
Emmenée par ce Viper sur Terre.
En revenant, j'ai une vision
qui m'amčne au vaisseau-mčre.
Son hybride me dit que les 5 derniers
Cylons sont allés sur Terre,
mais il nous faut le 3 manquant,
D'Anna, pour les éclairer.
Et maintenant on commence
ŕ recevoir des messages de l'au-delŕ.
Tu as entendu le signal.
Les derniers Cylons m'ont mené ŕ lui.
Si c'est la Terre, ils nous ont donné
le foyer de la 13čme tribu.
Exactement
comme l'avait prédit l'hybride.
Que ça te plaise ou non, Lee,
quelque chose orchestre ça dans un but.
Une puissance divine.
Appelle ça comme tu veux,
mais on dirait qu'il veut
qu'on trouve la Terre avec les Cylons.
Une minuscule aiguille
dans toute la flotte.
Tu as raison.
C'est pas grand chose.
Je ne pouvais pas faire mieux
en si peu de temps.
Donc vous ętes tous d'accord
que c'est le chemin vers la Terre ?
Ça y ressemble, mais c'est
la meilleure explication que nous ayons.
C'est pourquoi nous avons décidé
de le partager avec vous.
Nous aurions pu faire un bond
et partir en vous laissant ici.
Mais ça aurait mené ŕ un autre
conflit, une autre impasse.
Tout ceci est déjŕ arrivé...
mais ça n'a pas ŕ se reproduire,
si on se décide ŕ changer.
Pręts ŕ prendre un nouveau chemin.
Ici, et tout de suite...
Vous aviez peur qu'on tue ces 4 lŕ,
et pourtant, les voilŕ,
juste derričre vous.
<i>Libres de partir...</i>
<i>ou de rester.</i>
Je leur ai accordé l'amnistie.
La question est,
qu'est-ce qu'on fait maintenant ?
Trčs bien.
Je vais libérer votre équipage.
Nous allons sur Terre ensemble.
Nous avons retracé le signal.
Il y aura besoin de corrections,
mais...
voici notre destination, juste lŕ.
La Terre.
Alors,
quels sont tes ordres, Amiral ?
Des ordres ?
Es-tu pręt ŕ nous emmener
sur notre nouveau monde ?
Je ne sais pas.
Tu ne sais pas quoi ?
Qu'est-ce que tu ne sais pas ?
C'est bon de te revoir.
On y est.
On y est.
C'est la raison pour laquelle
nous nous sommes battus.
Je veux vous voir prendre
cette premičre poignée de terre.
Allez.
Je reviens.
Je comprends...
Merci.
Merci.
Peu importe, je suis content
de vous revoir Mme la Présidente.
Ainsi que le Quorum.
Je crois que je viens d'achever
la plus courte présidence de l'histoire.
Certes, mais ne vous croyez pas
libre, M. Adama.
Parce que vous avez affronté une crise
et su exactement quoi faire,
vous avez fait face.
La flotte aura besoin
de ce genre de dirigeants
dans les jours ŕ venir.
donc vous n'ętes pas encore hors-jeu.
Merci.
Vous restez assis ŕ papoter
ou bien on trouve la Terre ?
Kara et moi avons analysé
le trajet...
Je m'en fous.
C'est le bout du chemin.
Nous n'avons nulle part
oů aller.
Et si nous donnons trop de temps
ŕ l'alliance, elle va encore s'écrouler.
Va falloir jouer serré.
On y va tous ensemble.
Aussi vite que l'on peut.
Oui, Monsieur.
Flotte en ordre pour le bond.
En attente.
Tous les voyants sont au vert.
Les vaisseaux rapportent
qu'ils sont pręts pour le bond, Amiral.
Trčs bien.
Mme la Présidente,
sans vous,
nous n'y serions pas arrivés.
Donnez l'ordre.
Il a fallu longtemps pour
que ça arrive.
Emmenez-nous sur Terre.

Équipage du Galactica,
peuple de la flotte.
ici l'Amiral Adama.
Il y a trois ans, je vous promettais
de vous emmener dans un nouveau foyer.
Nous avons eu un voyage difficile.
Nous avons tant perdu,
nous avons tant souffert.
et la vérité c'est que je me
demandais si ce jour viendrait.
Mais aujourd'hui,
notre voyage s'achčve.
Nous sommes arrivés...

On a réussi, gamine.
On a réussi.
Tu as réussi.

TWELVE CYLON MODELS
SEVEN ARE KNOWN
FOUR LIVE IN SECRET
ONE WILL BE REVEALED
previously on battlestar galactica.
I just finished the post-flight on starbuck's viper.
This thing looks like it's been rolled off the showroom floor.
It's time to get some answers.
Plug it in.
Jump!
president roslin was apparently aboard the cylon baseship,
along with gaius baltar and many of galactica's pilots when it jumped away.
waiting alone in a raptor as the rest of the fleet jump away.
That sounds a lot like suicide,dad.
Why are you doing this?
because I can't live without her.
we have d'anna onboard.
We are clear of the hub.
Commence nuclear trike.
So you know about the final five.
I know they're supposed to know the way to earth.
I've gotta worry about protecting myself.
I will tell you when you take me back to your fleet.
I love you.
About time.
Hey there,mr.Prez.
Heard you were here.
Temple of aurora.
On earth.
At least the way pythia described it.
We'll get there.
Walk those halls together.
Yeah,pretty to think so.
This roslin's stuff?
It's weird for them to not be here.
No one sits in his chair.
Tigh can't even look at it.
You know,the scariest thing my mom used to tell me when I was a kid,
"your father is waiting for you in the study."
I'd knock on the door.
Make the long walk across the room.
To that desk.
You know,leoben said something to me
when he was holding me in that doll house on new caprica.
That children are born to replace their parents.
For children to reach their full potential their parents have to die.
We rejoin your fleet in less than an hour.
Then we will return your final five to you.
Four.
There are four in your fleet.
Four.
Where's the fifth?
I want the four in your fleet.
It would be easier if you just tell us who they are.
Oh,easier because you could kill them.
Why would we do that?
They know the way to earth.We need them.
She's right.We all want the same thing.
- If we cooperate...
- we cooperated on new caprica,brother.
It didn't work out well.
I'm going to hold your people hostage until the final four are safely aboard this ship.
You need to stand down,bill.
Come on.
Trust me.
Stand down.
Pass the word around.
Stack arms.
I've already had an eight prepare a raptor,
so we'll launch as soon as we come out of the jump.
Oh,and,admiral,you'll be coming along with me to galactica.
- I'm not going.
- Bill,go.
Ifhe cylons get the four,they get earth.
You can't let this happen.
Even if you do blow this ship to hell.
Oh,godsdamn it.
I got it,felix.
Yeah.thanks.
Mr.Gaeta,do you wish to be relieved?
Good to go.
Dradis contact.
Incoming,bearing 1-8-5,carom 2-niner-niner at 1700.
- What do we got?
- Cylon baseship.
Another contact,same bearing.
It's a raptor.
Our people are back,sir.
Maybe she won't be able to identify us.
Gods,it's...it's good to have you back.
It's good to be home.
The goods news is that your president,laura roslin,
is alive and well,as are your crewmates.
She wants the four cylons that are in this fleet.
She's gonna hold our people hostage until she gets them.
You don't have to do anything except stay out of the way.
I'm already in contact with them.
Now that they realize there's nothing to fear
and that we only want to love and protect them,
they should find a way of joining us.
I just ask that you don't interfere with any of the shuttle traffic in the fleet.
So your plan is you take these four cylons
and then you head off to earth,leaving us behind.
Now that's up to them.
All right.
If these four cylons want to come to you,they're free to do so.
I will not stop them.
Do you agree with this,admiral?
Agreed.
Well,then I will await them on the baseship.
Laura roslin needs her medication.
And I need to make sure that she's all right.
- I'm gonna go with them.
- No.
We can't give them any more hostages.
the colonel's right.
I served under roslin for two years.
My place is by her side.
Another hostage isn't gonna change the equation.
All right,go.
Thank you.
I backed your play,and now what?
Starbuck goes to work on a plan to get our people back by force.
If we can't stop the cylons from reaching the baseship,
laura roslin wants it destroyed.
Half our guys are over there.
It's your call,mr.President.
Roslin's right.
We lose those four,we lose earth.
If everything goes south,we destroy the baseship and everyone on it.

39,665 SURVIVORS
IN SEARCH OF A HOME
CALLED EARTH
<font color="#ffff00">Battlestar Galactica
Season4 Episode10</font>
so the prisoners were here,
but d'anna has to know that you brought me in on this.
If she's moved the prisoners,it'll mean a compartment by compartment fight.
And if they open fire on the civilian fleet while we're boarding?
They could wipe out the human race right there and then.
that's why we need to make sure that
our raptors are already out there with their nukes cocked and locked.
There's gotta be other options.
Yeah,those frakkin' four could give themselves up.
Brothers and sisters,this is a great day for us.
One of our lost siblings has arrived.
She's one of the final five?
I saw her in my vision.
Now she's come home.
Laura.
there's been something I've been meaning to say to you.
- I wanted to thank you.- Um,for what?
Essentially for not murdering me.
That can't have been an easy decision to make.
But I love living.
I love living,and I wanted to thank you for saving my life.
I wouldn'T.
be so grateful if I were you.
You should know that I told the admiral that if d'anna doesn't back down,
he should blow the ship to pieces.
You what?
She's in here.
Madame president.
Gaius.
Tory.
Sit down.
I brought you your medication.
Oh,my gods.
How did you do that?
I came back with d'anna.
To be with my people.
Because you're one of the five.
You're one of the final five.
D'anna saw her.
In a vision.
I knew it.
Maybe not on a conscious level,
but subconsciously,I always knew there was something.
You had no idea.
Did you?
No.
Might be worth pondering what else you've been wrong about.
Tory,wait.
You're right.
I'm wrong.
Okay.
You are one of the revered final five,
and as such,the cylons will listen to you.
Is that not right?
So,tory,please go to d'anna
and try to convince her to back down and release all the hostages.
I'm done taking orders from you.
oh,mr.President,there has been a change of plans.
I've just executed the first of the colonial hostages.
Another will follow every quarter hour until our people come home.
All right,listen to me.
You're not giving us a chance.
We are cooperating.
She terminated the transmission.
All right then,admiral,you're a go for the rescue mission.
If it fails.
destroy the baseship.
Yes,mr.President.
All right,put these pilots in their cockpits.
Check all systems,and let's put these birds in the tubes.
Got it,chief.
There you go.
Apu won't spin up.
There's gotta be a short,and damned if I can find it.
But I set some guys tracking on it.
Galen,you with me?
You all know that we have a baseship out there with our people on it.
It is our job to get them back alive.
So speed is the only thing we have on our side.
They're no doubt expecting us to try for a breakout,
so we have to get in under their reaction time,which is damn fast.
Raptor flights two and six under athena will be our breaching force.
What's the matter?
I'm hearing it again.
All right.
Anyone know what the frak we're doing here?
I don't know.I just felt compelled.
Something about this viper.
Like what?
You checked every rivet and washer on that bird,and you didn't find squat.
Yeah,well,something brought us here.
Something's changed.
I just don't know what it is.
Maybe kara can help.
She flew this thing to earth and back.
Go find her.See what she can tell you.
But hurry up.
A lot of good people are gonna die.
So where are you going?
Bill,you gotta scrub this mission.
What the hell are you doing here?
You're supposed to be in the cic.
The cylons will kill every godsdamn hostage
before we put one pair of boots aboard their ship.
Laura roslin will be the next to die,bill.
I'm looking for options.
You got one?
Yeah.
I should've told you when I first found out,but I didn't have the guts.
What's wrong with you,saul?
Remember back at the nebula when I told you about that frakkin' music?
I thought it was in the ship.
I was wrong.
It was a signal.
Some kind of crazy,frakked-up cylon signal switched me on.
I can't turn it off.
Switched you on.
Like boomer.
I'm one of the five.
The five.
One of the cylons d'anna's after.
Quit frakkin' with me.
Colonel,I've known you for 30 years.
I told you.
I didn't find out until the nebula.
Think about this.
When I met you,you had hair.
I never heard of a cylon aging.
Doesn't mean they don'T.
Before the attack on the colonies,
we didn't know skinjobs existed.
Turns out there's another kind of cylon we didn't know about,
and I'm one of them.
On new caprica,you were in captivity.
They did something to you.
They...an implant,a post-hypnotic suggestion that makes you feel this way.
Let's go talk to doc cottle...
listen to me!
It is not a delusion.
It is not a chip in my head.I am a cylon.
I've fooled you for months now.
I didn't want to,but I did.
Get your hands off of me.
If I had the guts to airlock myself when I first found out,
we wouldn't be in this mess.
But that's the way out.
Not this suicidal attack.
I am one of the final five.
D'anna will back down if you threaten to flush me out an airlock.
Dad,dad.
Dad,listen.
No one suspected.
No one.
Not with his record,what he did on new caprica.
His eye,what happened to his wife... come on,let's get up.
What have I done?
All the people I've sent to die.
For what?
For what?
For earth.
There is no earth.
It's a frakkin' joke.
There is no earth.
Okay,dad,listen to me.
Listen to me!
Pull it together.
- I can'T.
- Yes,you can.Come on.
- I can'T.
- Yes,you can.
I can't... I can't kill him.
I can't kill the bastard.
I can'T.
- Okay,okay,dad.
- I can'T.
It's...it's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
I'll...I'll take care of it.
I can'T.
I'll take care of it.
You mother-frakker.
Who are the others?
Where's the old man?
Right where you put him.
Mr.President,it's the cic.
D'anna's on the line.
This is the president.
mr.President.
you're running out of time.
no,you are.
It's your turn to listen.
If you harm another one of my people,
you so much as blacken one of their eyes,
and I flush saul tigh out of the launch tube.
we have no wish for further bloodshed.
May I speak with the admiral?
No,you deal with me.
You have ten minutes to release my people
or you can kiss one of your precious final five good-bye.
You want to save the fleet,I need the others,and I need them now.
it's sitting here the same way it has been for months.
What made you think something was happening?
Hard to explain.
You know,it's just a feeling.
Yeah,I've got a feeling too.
You're both out of your frakkin' minds.
You know,you had a feeling you could find earth.
I trusted you.
I backed you every step of the way.
Now I need you to trust ours.
Ensign anders.
Specialist tyrol.
Slowly put your hands on your heads and face the viper.
Do it now!
What the hell is going on?
They're cylons,just like the xo.
Sam.
Go ahead.
It's true,kara.
There's something different about this viper.
Something's changed.
You gotta find it.
shut up.
Fall back!
Fall back!
Where the hell are you taking us?
Keep moving.Otherwise,we shoot you here.
No!
This is a wild guess.
You told them.
We should've done it day one.
Get the baseship on the horn.
Mr. Hoshi,we need the baseship.
what's going on?
D'anna's about to start executing more hostages.
okay,take me to d'anna.
no,she won't listen to you.
I was the one with her in the temple
when she had the vision of the five...take me.
He's right.
Take him,it's good.
Are you ready to come to your senses,mr.President?
galen tyrol and samuel anders have just joined saul tigh in the airlock.
They found them.
They're in line for an express ride into a vacuum.
You want them alive,stand down.
I know lee.
Press him and he'll back down.
Target our nuclear weapons on the civilian fleet.
We'll see if he wants to play hardball.
D'anna.
Gaius.
Coercion won't work with lee adama.
He's too similar to his father.
Lee's bluffing.
He's doesn't give a tinker's damn about those three,not now.
You push him,he'll kill them.
Then the entire human race will die with them.
Mr.President,the baseship nukes just went hot.
If any of our fleet starts spooling up...
they won't have time to jump before the cylons fire.
Sergeant harder,clear the tube of everyone but tigh.
Corporal.
Do you really think that god brought you back from the darkness for this,d'anna?
Maybe he brought you back for a different purpose.
To end this peacefully.
They will never forgive us for what we did to the twelve colonies,never.
Proceed.
Brute force did not work for you on new caprica.
It didn't work for you on the algae planet.
So why is it gonna work for you now?
Give me the key.
We have weapons lock on their ships.
What are you waiting for,apollo?
Do it.
lee,stop!
Stop,stop!
Those three frakkin' cylons just gave us earth.
Well,it's a colonial emergency locator signal.
And no other wireless in the fleet is picking this up?
Gaeta's confirmed it.
The channel's empty except for this viper.
It's gotta be a signal from earth.
You're reaching,kara.
Come on,lee,add it up.
I vanish into a storm.
Ride this viper to earth.
Coming back,I get a vision that leads me to the baseship.
Its hybrid tells me that the final five cylons have been to earth,
but we need the missing three,d'anna,to bring them out into the open.
And now we're starting to get messages from the beyond.
You heard the signal.
The final cylons led me to it.
If it's earth,they've given us the home of the thirteenth tribe
just the way the hybrid said it would happen.
Like it or not,lee,something's orchestrating this for a purpose.
A higher power.
Call it whatever you want,but it seems to want us to find earth with the cylons.
One tiny needle in the whole fleet.
Well,you're right.It's wafer thin.
It's the best I could do at short notice.
So you're all in agreement this is the way to earth?
It's a stretch,but it's the best explanation we've got.
Which is why we chose to share this information with you.
We could've jumped away with it,left you behind.
But that would've led to another confrontation,another standoff.
All this has happened before...
but it doesn't have to happen again.
Not if we make up our minds to change.
Take a different path.
Right here,right now.
You were afraid we'd kill these four,and yet,here they are,standing behind you.
Free to go.
Or stay.
I've granted them an amnesty.
So the question is,where do we go from here?
All right.
I'll release your crew.
We go to earth together.
We've projected a course toward the signal.
It'll probably take some revising as we go,but.
this is our destination right here.
Earth.
So.
what are your orders,admiral?
Orders?
Are you ready to take us to our new home?
I don't know.
you don't know what?
What don't you know about?
It's good to see you.
Bill.
this is it.
This is it.
This is everything that we have been working for.
I want to see you pick up that first fistful of earth.
Come on.
Frak.
I see.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Anyway,I'm glad to see you again,madame president.
And so is the quorum.
And I guess I just finished the shortest presidency in colonial history.
Yes,well,don't look so relieved,mr.Adama.
Because you were dealt a crisis and you knew exactly what to do.
You faced it boldly.
This fleet is going to need that kind of leadership in the days to come,
so you are not off the hook yet.
Thank you.
You guys just gonna sit here flapping your lips or are we gonna go find earth?
Kara and I have been working on a recon plan...
frak it.
This is the end of the line.
We've got nowhere else to go.
And if we give the alliance too much time,it'll fall apart again.
Gotta roll the hard six.
We all go together.
As fast as we can.
Yes,sir.
Fleet in jump formation.Standing by.
Board is green.
Ship reports ready to jump,admiral.
Very well.
Madame president,without you we wouldn't have made it.
Give the order.
It's been a long time coming.
Okay.
Take us to earth.
in five.
four.
three.
two.
one.
jump.
Jump complete.
dradis is clear.
fleet is checking in.
Nav.
Confirming position.
take your time.
Get it right.
Fleet all present and accounted for.
Visible constellations are a match.
Crew of galactica.
people of the fleet.
this is admiral adama.
Three years ago,I promised to lead you to a new home.
We've endured a difficult journey.
We've all lost,we've all suffered,
and the truth is I questioned whether this day would ever come.
But today,our journey is at an end.
We have arrived.
at earth.
We made it,kid.
We did it.
You did it.
Earth.

DOUZE MODÈLES CYLONS
SEPT SONT CONNUS
QUATRE VIVENT AU SEIN DE LA FLOTTE
LE DERNIER SERA RÉVÉLÉ
<i>Précédemment dans</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
J'ignore ce qu'on deviendra
tous les deux.
J'ai du mal...
- à accepter ça.
- On doit aller de l'avant.
Maintenir la cohésion de la flotte.
Trouver la Terre.
Il y a 3 600 ans,
la Pythie a décrit l'exil
et la renaissance de la race humaine.
Les seigneurs désignèrent un chef
pour guider la caravane des cieux
vers leurs nouvelles terres.
Je suis revenue avec D'Anna
pour être parmi les miens.
Vous êtes l'une des leurs.
Vous faites partie des Cinq.
En fait, il y a un autre type de Cylons
qu'on connaît pas,
- et j'en suis un.
- Caporal !
Embarquez-moi ça !
Mettez les mains sur la tête
et tournez-vous face au Viper.
- C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
- Ce sont des Cylons.
Il y a un truc différent sur ce Viper.
Quelque chose a changé.
Trouve quoi.
C'est un signal de détresse colonial.
Vous êtes d'accord,
c'est le chemin de la Terre ?
C'est mince,
mais c'est la meilleure explication.
La question est donc :
où allons-nous ?
Nous allons sur Terre ensemble.
La Terre.

D'après les éclaireurs,
c'est toute la planète.
Aucune réponse à nos signaux.
Aucun signe d'activité humaine.
Pareil de notre côté.
Ce signal est vraiment faible.
La batterie de la balise

Elle émet peut-être

Radiation de faible niveau

a été atomisée il y a 2 000 ans.
Ça correspond à ce que nos équipes
ont trouvé partout sur la planète.
Parfait.
On quitte une civilisation atomisée
pour en trouver une autre.
Allons-nous-en.
Baisse pas les bras.
Ressaisis-toi.
Du calme, Dee.
Calme-toi.
Sors-moi de là.
Madame la présidente !
La présidente fera bientôt
une déclaration.
Vous saurez tout en temps voulu.
C'est colonial.
Standard sur tous les vaisseaux.
Ça fait partie du système de navigation.
"757-NC."
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Ça signifie quoi ?
Mon vaisseau
est immatriculé 8757-NC.
Je vais l'attraper !
Attention à la table !
Raptor abattu !
Merci, Dee.
Tu rigoles ?
J'avais hâte.
On revient vite, d'accord ?
Merci, Dee. Au revoir, chérie !
Tu n'as pas la moindre idée
de ce qui se passe, hein ?
Un jour comme les autres.
Par ici !
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
On en a trouvé avec les ossements,
partout sur la planète.
Des Centurions.
Ils leur ressemblent,
mais ne sont pas des nôtres.
Ce design est inconnu.
La Treizième tribu s'est installée ici
et a créé ses Cylons.
Et les machines se sont soulevées
et ont tué leurs maîtres.
On le croyait.
Jusqu'à ce qu'on teste les ossements.
250 squelettes jusqu'ici.
De quatre sites différents.
- Selon nos protocoles...
- Les résultats sont concluants.
- Où voulez-vous en venir ?
- Ils ne sont pas humains.
Ce sont des Cylons.
Tous ?
Tous.
La Treizième tribu,
c'était des Cylons.
La Treizième tribu,
la tribu des Cylons,
est arrivée sur cette planète
et l'a appelée Terre.
Madame la présidente,
que fait-on pour le Quorum ?
Vous devez leur parler.
On doit leur dire quelque chose.
Ça doit venir de leur présidente.
À toi l'honneur.
Bill, faut qu'on parle.
J'ai pas mal de choses à expliquer.
Si mon Viper s'est écrasé ici,
qui le pilotait ?
Et qu'est-ce que j'ai piloté
jusqu'au Galactica ?
Vaut peut-être mieux pas savoir.
Tu me dis toujours de faire face
à la vérité, de ne pas la fuir.
Pourquoi ce revirement ?
J'ai un pressentiment.
- Ça pourrait ne pas te plaire.
- À moi ou à toi ?
Te voilà.
Le Raptor est prêt à te ramener.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Je réfléchissais.
Tous les pilotes
qui se sont assis dans ces sièges...
ont donné leurs vies pour le rêve
d'un nouveau départ sur Terre.
Je ne veux pas
qu'ils se soient sacrifiés pour rien.
Tu as encore ce regard.
Lequel ?
Celui que tu avais quand ton père
a ramené le Galactica sur New Caprica.
On était restés sur le Pegasus,
avec les civils.
- Tu pensais ne jamais le revoir.
- "Je suis si transparent ?"
"Seulement pour moi."
On a passé de bons moments, non,
sur le Pegasus ?
Ouais.
Je me souviens
de ce que tu m'as dit.
Qu'on devait continuer
à faire avancer les humains.
Tu l'as fait.
Non, on l'a fait.
J'aurais pas pu le faire sans toi.
Tu réussiras cette fois encore.
Je sais pas comment.
Je sais pas quoi dire au Quorum.
Bonne nouvelle,
l'immobilier est donné.
- Mais je peux pas raconter ça gaiement.
- Alors, ne le fais pas.
Dis-leur la vérité.
Ils doivent l'entendre,
et l'entendre de ta bouche.
Si quelqu'un peut leur donner
une raison d'avancer,
c'est toi,
Apollo.
Tu veux...
Je vais prendre un verre,
vers 19 heures.
Tu m'accompagnerais ?
Avec plaisir.
Aide-moi, bon sang !
Si tu as une explication,
c'est le moment.
Je n'en ai pas.
J'avais tort.
Pour la Terre.
Votre hybride m'a dit quelque chose.
Je serais le messager de la mort,
qui nous mènera tous à notre perte.
Elle t'a dit ça ?
C'est vrai ?
C'est vrai ?
Si c'est moi, là-dedans,
je suis quoi ?
Je suis quoi ?
<i>"Alors, ne parlons plus à tort
maintenant,</i>
<i>"il commence à se faire tard."</i>
Tu te souviens de quelque chose ?
Je vivais ici.
Moi aussi.
La chanson qui nous a activés...
Je la jouais.
Pour une femme que j'aimais.
Je m'en souviens.
Vraiment ?
Tu la jouais pour nous tous.
Ça, c'était moi.
On est morts dans un holocauste.
Alors, pourquoi on est encore en vie ?
C'est arrivé il y a 2 000 ans.
Comment on a rejoint les colonies
et cru qu'on était humains ?
2 000 ans,
ça fait beaucoup à oublier.
Il faut qu'on fasse quelque chose.
Le moral est en chute libre.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
La prophétie de la Pythie.
Cottle m'a dit que tu n'étais pas venue
prendre ton Doloxan.
C'est juste.
Tu veux me dire pourquoi ?
Ça ne me disait rien.
Tu vas reprendre rendez-vous.
Je ne crois pas.
Tu as besoin de ce traitement.
Non.
Que fais-tu ?
Tu comptes...
baisser les bras ?
- C'est toi qui m'as convaincu.
- Tu n'aurais pas dû m'écouter.
Quand les Cylons ont attaqué,
tu aurais dû tenir bon et combattre.
Parce que j'avais tort.
Sur toute la ligne.
Et ceux qui m'ont écoutée,
qui m'ont fait confiance,
et m'ont suivie,
tous ces gens,
ils sont morts.
- C'est pas...
- Arrête.
Ne me touche pas.
Pars.
Brûle.
Brûle.
Redis-le.
- Tu l'as entendu trois fois, Dee.
- Je veux me souvenir de chaque mot.
D'accord, j'ai dit :
"Mesdames et messieurs,
nous avons le choix.
"Nous pouvons y voir
une catastrophe,
"ou une opportunité.
"Moi, Lee Adama,
"ancien président par intérim,
et commandant du défunt Pegasus,
"Apollo pour mes amis,
je choisis l'opportunité.
"Nous ne sommes plus esclaves
des divagations de la Pythie,
"à quémander les restes
de la Treizième tribu.
"Nous sommes libres d'aller
où nous le souhaitons...
"et d'être nous-mêmes."
Je suis si fière.
J'ai réussi à retarder
une panique généralisée.
Mais je ne sais pas
quoi faire par la suite.
Je m'étais pas amusée autant
depuis très, très longtemps.
Merci pour ça.
- Quoi ?
- Tu rayonnes.
Vraiment ?
J'arrive pas à oublier
cette planète désolée.
S'il te plaît.
Je veux conserver ce sentiment
aussi longtemps que possible.
Regarde ça.
La petite Anna
a retrouvé son sourire.
Des fois, je me souviens même pas
que c'est moi.
Ça remonte à si longtemps.
Elle ignore totalement
ce qui l'attend.
Comme nous tous.
À l'aide !
Tout ira bien.
- Il faut un médecin.
- Elle va s'en tirer.
Envoyez un médecin par ici !
Envoyez un médecin !
Frak.
Un médecin !
Elle m'a embrassé il y a 45 minutes.
Et je lisais...
de la joie dans ses yeux.
Alors, pourquoi a-t-elle fait ça ?
J'en sais foutrement rien.
Qu'est-ce que tu as fait ?
Je t'ai laissé tomber.
Je les ai tous laissé tomber.
- Votre arme.
- Monsieur ?
Sur-le-champ !
- Chargée.
- Oui, monsieur.
On devrait parler à coeur ouvert,
comme tu le voulais.
Assieds-toi, Cylon.
Tu as de l'avance sur moi, Bill.
Et tu sais toujours pas
quand il faut la boucler
et obéir.
Bill, je suis vraiment désolé
de ne pas avoir eu le courage
de te l'avouer
dès que je l'ai découvert.
Va te faire foutre !
Tu n'as pas de tripes.
Tu es une putain de machine.
C'est comme ça qu'ils faisaient ?
Ils t'ont programmé
pour être mon ami ?
En imitant...
toutes les qualités que je respecte.
En me racontant des blagues.
Et elles me faisaient rire.
Bill...
j'ai choisi d'être ton ami.
J'en avais envie.
Ellen.
Tu vois, Ellen était plus intelligente
que ce que je pensais.
- Ne fais pas ça, Bill.
- Plus intelligente que moi.
Elle a toujours su
qu'un truc clochait chez toi.
C'est pour ça qu'elle s'est tapé
la moitié de la flotte.
- Ferme-la !
- Elle essayait de trouver un homme
qui avait du vrai sang
dans ses veines.
Ferme ta gueule !
Elle est venue me voir, une fois.
Comme une chienne en chaleur.
Je pouvais le sentir.
Elle sentait tellement bon.
Vas-y, fais-le ! Fais-le !
Ou c'est moi qui le ferai.
Vas-y !
Fais-le.
Vas-y.
Par les Dieux.
C'est pour ça que tu es venu.
Pour faire ça.
T'as pas les tripes
de t'en charger toi-même.
Désolé, Bill.
Cette fois, je peux pas t'aider.
On a tous les deux assez bu.
Je t'ai déjà parlé des étés
que je passais chez mon oncle,
quand j'étais gosse ?
Des renards...
attaquaient son poulailler,
tout le temps.
Ça le foutait en rogne.
Il me réveillait.
On partait avec ses chiens,
de nuit, dans les collines,
à la recherche du renard.
Quand les chiens
flairaient sa piste,
ils devenaient fous.
Ils devenaient une vraie meute.
Et rabattaient le renard...
vers la rivière.
Que faisaient les renards ?
La moitié faisait volte-face.
L'autre traversait la rivière.
Mais mon oncle m'a parlé...
de certains...
qui nageaient jusqu'à mi-rivière,
suivaient le courant
qui les emportait jusqu'à la mer.
Les pécheurs les trouvaient
à un kilomètre au large,
nageant.
Parce qu'ils voulaient se noyer.
Peut-être.
Peut-être qu'ils étaient juste...
fatigués.
Bon sang, Bill.
On peut pas se laisser dériver.
Je suis le XO de ce vaisseau.
Tu en es le commandant.
En quoi te mettre une balle
pourrait aider Dee ?
Ça n'aiderait certainement pas ceux
qui pensent à faire
exactement la même chose.
Qu'est-ce qu'ils feraient
sans le Patron pour les guider ?
Les guider où, Saul ?
Tu as perdu le signal
avant d'en trouver la source ?
Je dois te parler.
Il faut que je le dise...
T'as une sale mine.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Comment ça, Dee ?
Elle s'est suicidée.
Par les Dieux.
Je comprends pas.
Moi non plus.
J'essaie
de trouver une réponse logique.
Mais, à dire vrai,
je ne saurai jamais.
C'est trop tard.
M. Hoshi.
Vous remplacerez
le lieutenant Dualla.
M. Gaeta.
Trouvez-moi le plus proche système
de classe G, F ou K.
Contactez le vaisseau cylon.
Voyons si nos nouveaux alliés
veulent nous accompagner.
Membres de la flotte,
ici votre amiral.
<i>Notre découverte</i>
<i>des derniers jours</i>
<i>a été douloureuse pour nous tous.</i>
Vous le savez,
nous ne pouvons rester sur Terre.
<i>Mais ce n'est pas
une nouvelle épreuve.</i>
<i>La Treizième tribu de Kobol</i>
<i>s'est retrouvée exactement
dans la même situation que nous.</i>
<i>Ils ont connu
des pertes considérables.</i>
<i>Leur planète</i>
<i>transformée en cimetière.</i>
<i>Il leur fallait un foyer.</i>
<i>Alors, ils se sont mis en route,
vers le vide de l'espace</i>
<i>avec leurs vaisseaux
et leurs tripes.</i>
<i>Et la Treizième</i>
<i>a réussi.</i>
<i>Ils n'étaient pas des surhommes,</i>
<i>mais des gens ordinaires,</i>
<i>comme nous.</i>
<i>Ce qu'ils ont accompli,</i>
<i>nous pouvons l'accomplir.</i>
<i>Nous trouverons un nouveau foyer.</i>
<i>C'est une promesse</i>
<i>que j'ai l'intention de tenir.</i>
Allez,
remballez.
On quitte ce caillou
dans 15 minutes.
Vous devriez rejoindre votre vaisseau.
La flotte s'apprête à partir.
Je reste.
Vous savez, tout ça va se répéter,
encore et encore.
Je préfère quitter ce manège.
Je mourrai ici, parmi mes ancêtres.
L'idée de retrouver Cavil, là-haut,
me terrorise.
La mort dans le froid et l'obscurité
quand il nous rattrapera, non merci.
Ne sous-estimez pas le Patron.
Il nous trouvera un foyer.
Vous n'avez jamais voulu
arrêter le combat, colonel ?
Arrêter tout ça ?
Et suivre le courant jusqu'à la mer.
Saul !
Je te sors de là !
Ça va aller.
Ça va aller.
Tout est en place.
Nous renaîtrons...
de nouveau.
Ensemble.
Ellen, tu es le Cinquième.
<i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
I don't know
what to make of you and me.
I'm having trouble
- accepting this.
- We have to push forward.
Keep the fleet together.
Find Earth.
3,600 years ago,
Pythia wrote about the exile
and the rebirth of the human race.
And the Lords anointed a leader
to guide the caravan of the heavens
to their new homeland.
I came back with D'Anna
to be with my people.
Because you're one of the Five.
You're one of the Final Five.
Turns out there's another kind of Cylon
we didn't know about,
- and I'm one of them.
- Corporal!
Get it out of my sight!
Put your hands on your heads
and face the Viper. Do it now!
- What the hell is going on?
- They're Cylons.
There's something different
about this Viper. Something's changed.
You gotta find it.
That's a colonial
emergency locator signal.
So you're all in agreement
this is the way to Earth?
It's a stretch,
but it's the best explanation we've got.
So the question is,
where do we go from here?
We go to Earth together.
Earth.
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-
Admiral.
Our scouts say the same
all over the planet.
No answers to our hails.
No signs of human life.
It's the same report
we got from ours.
This signal's pretty weak.
The emergency locator battery
must be running low on juice.
It was probably on for a long time.
Low level radiation.
Definitely in the water
and the food chain.
Put word out not to eat or drink
anything down here.
Baltar just confirmed it. The planet
was nuked about 2,000 years ago.
It squares with what our teams
have been finding all over the planet.
It's perfect.
We traded one nuked civilization
for another.
Let's get out of here.
Just don't give up.
Just don't give up.
Don't fall apart.
Easy, Dee.
Take it easy.
Get me out of here.
Madam President!
Is Earth really a wasteland?
Is there anything at all?
The president will be making
a statement in due course.
You will find out everything
in good time.
It's colonial.
It's standard on all aircraft.
Part of our inertial nav system.
"757-NC."
Kara, what is it?
What does it mean?
The number on my ship is 8757-NC.
- I'm gonna get her!
- Hello!
No, stop!
I'm gonna go into the table!
Raptor's down!
Appreciate it, Dee.
You kidding?
I look forward to this.
I look forward to this.
We'll be back soon, okay?
Thanks, Dee. Bye, baby!
You have no idea
what's happened, do you?
Today is just another day.
Hey, over here!
What is it?
We found a couple of these
scattered among the bones
in sites around the planet.
Centurions.
Similar,
but they're not one of ours.
We've never seen this design.
So the Thirteenth Tribe settled here
and created their own Cylons.
And then the machines rose up
and killed their masters.
That's what we thought.
Until we tested the bones.
250 skeletons so far.
From four different sites
on the planet.
- Using our protocols...
- The results are conclusive.
- What's your point?
- They're not human.
They're Cylon.
All of 'em?
All of them.
The Thirteenth Tribe was Cylon.
The Thirteenth Tribe,
the tribe of Cylons,
came to this planet
and called it Earth.
Madam President,
what do we do about the Quorum?
You need to talk to them.
We need to tell them something.
It should come from their president.
Carry the ball.
Bill, we need to talk.
There's a lot of things
I gotta explain.
If my Viper's splattered all over
this planet, then who flew it here?
And what the hell
did I fly back to Galactica?
Maybe it's better off not knowing.
You're always telling me to face
the truth and not run from it.
Why the sudden change of heart?
I've got a feeling...
- You might not like what you find.
- For me or you?
There you are.
The Raptor's ready to take you
back to Colonial One.
What are you doing in here?
I was just thinking.
About all the pilots
who sat in those seats.
Gave their lives for a dream
of a new beginning on Earth.
I don't want their sacrifice
to be meaningless.
You've got that look again.
What look?
The one you had when your father
took Galactica back to New Caprica.
We stayed behind on Pegasus
with the civilian fleet.
You thought
you'd never see him again.
That easy to read, huh?
Just to me.
There were some good times for us,
weren't there,
on Pegasus?
Yeah.
I remember what you told me.
We had to keep the human race going.
And you did.
No, we did.
I couldn't have done
it without you, Dee.
You will this time, too.
I don't know how.
I don't know what the frak
I'm gonna tell the Quorum.
Good news is...
Real estate prices are low.
Truth is, there is no happy way
to spin this thing.
So don't.
Tell them the truth.
That's what people need to hear,
and they need to hear it from you.
If anybody can give them
a reason to go on...
it's you,
Apollo.
Would you...
I was gonna grab
a drink around 19:00.
Would you join me?
It's a date.
Help me, godsdamn it!
If you've got an explanation for this,
now's the time.
I don't have one.
I was wrong.
About Earth.
Your hybrid...
told me something.
Said that I was the harbinger of death.
That I would lead us all to our end.
She told you that?
Is it true?
Is it true?
If that's me lying there,
then what am I?
What am I?
What am I?
"So let us not talk falsely now
"'cause the hour is getting late."
You remember something?
Yeah.
I used to live here.
Me too.
That song that switched us on?
I played it.
For a woman I loved.
I remember.
You do?
You played it for all of us.
That was me.
We died in a holocaust.
Then why are we still alive?
That happened 2,000 years ago.
How did we get to the colonies?
Come to think that we were human?
2,000 years
is a long time to forget.
We gotta do something.
Morale is going down the toilet.
What are you doing?
The pythian prophecy.
Cottle told me that you didn't show up
for your Doloxan treatment.
That's right.
Do you want to tell me why?
I didn't feel like it.
You're gonna reschedule.
I don't think so.
Laura, you need your treatments.
No, I don't.
What are you doing?
You just gonna...
lie down and quit?
- You made me believe in this.
- You shouldn't have listened to me.
When the Cylons first attacked,
you should've held your ground
and kept fighting.
Because I was wrong.
I was wrong about everything.
And all those people who listened,
and they trusted me,
and they followed me,
all those people...
They're dead.
- That's not...
- Don't, stop.
Don't touch me.
Just go.
Burn.
Burn.
Tell me again.
- You've heard it three times, Dee.
- I want to remember every word.
All right, I said,
"Ladies and gentlemen,
we now have a choice.
"We can either view this
as a catastrophe
"or an opportunity.
"I, Lee Adama...
"ex-acting president, former commander
of the obliterated Battlestar Pegasus,
"Apollo to my friends,
I choose the latter.
"We're no longer enslaved
by the ramblings of Pythia.
"No longer pecking at the breadcrumbs
of the Thirteenth Tribe.
"We are now free
to go where we want to go...
"and be who we want to be."
I'm so proud.
I think I managed
to stall a full scale panic,
but I got no idea what to do next.
That is the best fun I have had...
In a long, long time.
Thank you for that.
- What?
- You're glowing.
Am I?
All I can think of is
that waste of a planet.
Please.
I just want to hang on
to this feeling for as long as I can.
Look at that.
Little Anna's got her smile back.
Sometimes I don't even
remember that's me.
It's so long ago.
She has no frakkin' idea
what's ahead of her.
None of us do.
Oh, my gods, help!
No, no, no, it's gonna be okay.
- We need a medic.
- She's gonna be okay.
We need a medic here!
We need a medic!
Frak.
Medic!
She kissed me good night
45 minutes ago,
and there was...
joy in her eyes.
So tell me why would she do this?
I don't frakkin' know.
No.
What did you do?
I let you down.
I let everybody down.
- Give me your sidearm.
- Sir?
Frakkin' now!
- Leave it loaded.
- Yes, sir.
I think we should have that little
heart to heart you've been pining for.
Sit down, Cylon.
Looks like you've got
a head start on me, Bill.
And it looks like you still don't know
when to shut your frakkin' mouth
and follow orders.
Bill, I am so sorry
that I didn't have the guts
to tell you
when I first found out.
Frak you!
You got no guts.
You're a frakkin' machine.
Is that how it worked?
They program you to be my friend?
Emulate...
all the qualities I respect.
Tell me jokes...
and I'd laugh at them.
Bill...
I was your friend
because I chose to be.
I wanted to be.
Ah, Ellen.
Yeah, you know, Ellen was smarter
than I gave her credit for.
- Don't go there, Bill.
- Smarter than me.
She knew from the beginning
that there was something wrong with you.
That's why she went around
frakkin' half the colonial fleet.
- Shut your mouth!
- Searching out, trying to find a man
who had real blood
in his main vein.
Shut your frakkin' mouth!
She came on to me once.
Like a dog in heat, I could smell.
I could smell it...
she smelled so good.
Go on, do it, do it, do it!
Or I will.
Go on, go on.
Do it.
Go on.
Oh, my Gods.
That's why you came here.
To do this.
You haven't got the frakkin' guts
to do it yourself.
I'm sorry, Bill.
This is one time I can't help you.
I think we've both had enough.
Did I ever tell you
about my summers with my uncle
when I was a kid?
Foxes...
would attack his henhouse
all the time.
Really pissed him off.
He'd wake me up.
We'd go with his hounds
at night up into the hills
looking for the fox.
When the dogs smelled the scent,
they'd go crazy.
The pack would become a team.
Forced the fox...
toward the river.
So what would the foxes do?
Half would turn and fight.
The other half
would try to swim across.
But my uncle told me about
a few that...
They'd swim halfway out,
turn with the current,
and ride it all the way out to sea.
Fishermen would find them
a mile offshore just...
swimming.
Because they wanted to drown.
Maybe.
Or maybe they were just...
tired.
Well, godsdamn it, Bill.
We can't swim out to sea.
I am the XO of this ship.
You are the commanding officer.
How is putting a bullet in your head
gonna help Dee?
It is sure as frak
isn't gonna help all the others
who are thinking about doing
the same godsdamn thing.
And what are they gonna do
without the old man here
to lead them?
Lead them where, Saul?
I hear you lost the signal.
You couldn't find the source.
I need to talk. I've gotta...
tell somebody.
You look like hell.
What's going on?
What about Dee?
She shot herself.
My Gods.
I don't understand.
No, neither do I, you know.
I'm trying
to come up with a neat answer.
But truth is,
I'll never know.
'Cause it's too frakkin' late.
Mr. Hoshi.
Take over for
Lieutenant Dualla.
Mr. Gaeta.
Find me
the closest G, F or K class star system.
Get the Cylon baseship on the horn.
See if our new allies
want to come along for the ride.
Men and women of the fleet.
This is the admiral.
<i>The discoveries</i>
<i>of the past few days</i>
<i>have been painful for all of us.</i>
As you know,
we cannot stay on Earth.
<i>But this is not a new challenge.</i>
<i>The Thirteen tribes of Kobol</i>
<i>stood exactly on the same spot
that we are right now.</i>
<i>They experienced dreadful losses.</i>
<i>Their planet</i>
<i>was a graveyard.</i>
<i>They needed a home.</i>
<i>So they set out
in the void of deep space</i>
<i>with nothing but their ships
and their guts.</i>
<i>And the Thirteen</i>
<i>succeeded.</i>
<i>They weren't supermen.</i>
<i>They were ordinary people</i>
<i>like us.</i>
<i>What they can accomplish,</i>
<i>we can accomplish.</i>
<i>We will find a new home.</i>
<i>This is a promise</i>
<i>I intend to keep.</i>
All right, people, pack it up.
We're off this rock in 15 minutes.
You'd better get back to your ship.
The fleet is about to jump.
I'm not going.
You know, all this is just gonna happen
again and again and again.
So I'm getting off
this merry-go-round.
I'll die here with my ancestors,
and it beats the hell out of
being out there with Cavil.
Gonna die in the cold and the dark
when Cavil catches up with us.
Well, I wouldn't count
the old man out.
He'll find us a home.
Don't you ever want
to stop fighting it, colonel?
Don't you just want
to stop all of this?
And just ride the tide out to sea.
Saul!
I'll get you out!
It's okay.
It's okay.
Everything is in place.
We'll be reborn...
again.
Together.
Ellen, you're the Fifth.

ce soir apparemment.
M'approche pas, putain !
Je sais que vous Ítes des Cylons !
Je sais que tu passes
beaucoup de temps ŗ interroger la Six.
Je ne la torture pas,
si c'est ce qui t'inquiŤte.
Cottle dit qu'elle est enceinte.
Tu comptes baisser les bras ?
J'avais tort sur toute la ligne.
Et tous ceux
qui m'ont fait confiance...
sont morts.
Nous trouverons un nouveau foyer.
C'est une promesse
<i>que j'ai l'intention de tenir.</i>
Contactez le vaisseau cylon.
Voyons si nos nouveaux alliťs
veulent nous accompagner.
<i>"Il est une langueur de la vie</i>
<i>"Plus imminente que la douleur</i>
<i>"Cette hťritiŤre lui succŤde</i>
<i>"Lorsque l'‚me
a souffert tout ce qu'elle peut"</i>
Je vois rien.
- Attends, je vois quelque chose.
- Oý ?
Juste lŗ. Attends. Non ?
- J'ai cru le voir.
- Voir quoi ?
Bouclez-la tous une seconde.
- J'y suis. Lŗ.
- Oui, le voilŗ.
Je le vois.
Je le vois !
Mon Dieu, il est lŗ.
Il est magnifique.
Je vois toujours rien.
Essayez d'ouvrir les yeux.
L'oeil.
Ici, colonel.
Voici la tÍte,
une ťpaule et voici une petite main.
Incroyable.
C'est notre enfant.
Notre enfant.
Me faut un verre.
Tenez, c'est presque aussi bon.
On ne fume pas
prŤs d'une femme enceinte.
Elle survivra.
Regarde, Saul.
Tu sais ce qu'il reprťsente ?
Le futur de toute la race cylon.
Le mŰme a pas encore de nom
et il porte dťjŗ de grands espoirs.
Pour les combler,
il n'a qu'ŗ naÓtre.
L'accouplement de deux Cylons
n'avait jamais donnť d'enfant.
Crois-moi, on a essayť.
«a signifie que...
Que notre race peut survivre
mÍme sans rťsurrection.
La nation cylon va survivre.
Ishay,
apporte-moi le moniteur foetal.
Je veux ťtablir le profil biophysique
de ce... sauveur.
Dťsolťe, Felix. Il est dťbordť,
mais il devrait pas tarder.
Pas grave.
Au moins, les Cylons s'amusent.
La Terre en ruine, Dee morte,
les suicides en hausse,
la pagaille dans la flotte,
la prťsidente aux abonnťs absents,
mais veillons au bien-Ítre des Cylons.
Faites pťnťtrer Áa pour rťduire
l'irritation et la dťshydratation, OK ?
Non, putain.
J'ai dťjŗ vidť deux pots de ce truc.
«a marche pas.
Il faudrait remodeler le support.
Je lui ai dit qu'il ťtait trop haut,
mais il m'ťcoute pas.
Dťsolťe, Felix. Vraiment.
Je te fais entrer au plus vite,
mais c'est la folie.
ņ l'aide !
- On est dťbordťs aujourd'hui.
- Il urine du sang.
Il va falloir attendre. Lit nį 3.
Je vais chercher un docteur.
Dťsolťe.
«a arrive, ce moniteur foetal ?
- Les toasters n'attendent pas.
- En effet.
Amiral ! Amiral !
Le colonel Tigh
assume-t-il encore ses fonctions,
et n'Ítes-vous pas inquiet
d'avoir un Cylon pour second ?
Je ne suis pas lŗ pour discuter
protocole ou hiťrarchie militaire.
Est-il vrai que vous comptez conclure
une alliance permanente
avec les rebelles cylons
de la flotte ?
Je ne commenterai pas
des conjectures.
M. le vice-prťsident,
vous approuvez ?
Sans commentaire.
Sťrieusement ! Incroyable !
Oý est la prťsidente Roslin ?
Merci, Playa.
La prťsidente
se repose sur le Galactica.
DerniŤre question.
Oui, Seku.
Avez-vous la moindre information
concernant l'identitť du 5e Cylon ?
Nous pensons
que le 5e Cylon est mort.
Sans certitude ?
Non, mais nous pensons
qu'elle est morte il y a...
- Elle ?
- Vous savez que c'ťtait une femme ?
C'ťtait la derniŤre question.
Merci d'Ítre venus.
- Pourquoi j'ai dit Áa ?
- C'ťtait quoi, Áa ?
Oubliez.
Une alliance permanente
entre le gouvernement et les Cylons
est hors de question.
Vous le savez, j'espŤre.
- C'est pas ŗ vous d'en dťcider.
- Mais ŗ vous ?
Vous Ítes ŗ nouveau prťsident ?
Dťsolť, j'ai du mal ŗ suivre
quel poste vous occupez.
Laura Roslin est toujours prťsidente.
La dťcision lui revient.
Et oý est Laura Roslin ?
J'oubliais.
Elle se repose sur le Galactica.
Amusant, pile quand ses prophťties
se rťvŤlent Ítre des conneries.
Au revoir.
Si vous nous imposez
une alliance avec les Cylons,
il y aura des consťquences.
Je vous le promets.
Merci, M. Zarek.
Ainsi, il sera plus facile
de dťterminer le coupable
en cas d'incident malencontreux.
Je suis facile ŗ trouver, Amiral.
Je suis lŗ.
ņ la tÍte du gouvernement.
Pour l'instant.
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA
Saison 4 - …pisode 12
39 644 SURVIVANTS
ņ LA RECHERCHE D'UN FOYER
Sous-titres
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-
Sur le vaisseau-mŤre,
on prťfŤre se ranger de votre cŰtť,
plutŰt que d'affronter seuls
les forces de Cavil.
- On ?
- Oui.
Nous... Les Cylons.
Cette description pourrait
s'appliquer ŗ quelqu'un d'autre ?
Vous parlerez de Áa une autre fois.
- Et pour les FTL ?
- C'est possible.
«a sera un travail long et rťbarbatif,
mais on devrait pouvoir amťliorer
les moteurs FTL de la flotte entiŤre
avec la technologie cylon.
Le Quorum va nous donner
du fil ŗ retordre.
On s'en fout.
Ce sont des vaisseaux civils.
Vous allez faire quoi ?
Les menacer ?
On a besoin du Quorum
pour obtenir la coopťration des civils.
Bien.
Comment convaincre le Quorum ?
Ils voudront savoir
si ces amťliorations peuvent Ítre faites
uniquement par le personnel
du Galactica.
C'est une chose d'accepter
la technologie cylon.
C'en est une autre
d'avoir des Cylons ŗ bord.
Je comprends ŗ peine ces choses,
et je...
On va avoir besoin d'ťquipes
de Sharon et de Six,
voire de Leoben,
rien que pour les installations.
- Ils vont criser.
- Faut Ítre vendeur.
Dťcrire les avantages.
Selon Athena, l'amťlioration
devrait tripler la capacitť de saut.
Absolument.
Et c'est pour notre survie.
Leur technologie...
Notre technologie
est bien plus avancťe que la nŰtre.
La vŰtre.
Vous voulez un dessin
pour pas vous tromper ?
Qu'en penses-tu ?
«a triplerait nos chances
de trouver une planŤte habitable,
avant d'Ítre ŗ court
de nourriture et de carburant.
- Je peux leur vendre Áa.
- Et en contrepartie ?
Parce qu'il y a une contrepartie,
hein, ex-chef ?
On veut faire partie de la flotte.
Pour de bon.
La citoyennetť,
un siŤge au Quorum, la totale.
- Vous Ítes fous ?
- Non nťgociable.
Vous voulez la technologie cylon.
Nous, une protection contre Cavil.
Si nous sommes citoyens,
votre serment...
vous dictera
de nous protťger ťgalement.
Et les autres Cylons,
ils pensent vraiment
que Áa garantira votre sťcuritť ?
Oui.
Je les ai convaincus
que l'amiral prend Áa trŤs au sťrieux.
Qu'il prťfťrerait perdre la flotte
- plutŰt que rompre un serment.
- Contrairement ŗ d'autres.
Contrairement ŗ d'autres.
Je comprends leur raisonnement.
C'est logique,
- de leur point de vue.
- Vous n'y songez pas sťrieusement.
Monsieur.
Vous n'y songez pas sťrieusement,
monsieur.
Toutes les options sont sur la table,
M. Gaeta.
C'est une dťcision politique.
Je vais devoir la soumettre
ŗ la prťsidente. Merci ŗ tous.
Amiral, je peux vous parler ?
Insuffisance rťnale aiguŽ.
On l'a dťtectťe ŗ temps
pour la traiter par dialyse.
Cependant,
il y a un risque que Áa conduise
ŗ une insuffisance chronique.
Auquel cas
il perdra un rein.
Et maintenant, je fais quoi ?
Je lui donne mon sang ?
Je constitue des rťserves ?
On a assez de sang de son type.
Il est ŗ moitiť cylon.
Vous avez beaucoup
de sang ŗ moitiť cylon ?
Non, vous avez raison.
Je n'y avais pas pensť.
Nous devrions commencer
ŗ faire des rťserves.
- C'est ridicule, vous devez lui dire.
- Me dire quoi ?
Il pourrait mourir.
- Son pŤre devrait savoir.
- Ishay, boucle-la !
De quoi elle parle ?
Nous en reparlerons plus tard.
Vous feriez mieux de me suivre.
Coucou, mon grand. «a va ?
TrŤs bien.
«a va vous faire un choc.
Mais j'avais les mains liťes
par le secret mťdical.
MÍme si elle est morte,
Áa s'applique toujours.
Cally ?
Vous parlez de Cally.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle...
Je ne suis pas le pŤre ?
Je suis navrť.
Elle a dťcouvert sa grossesse
juste avant votre mariage.
Elle n'ťtait pas sŻre
que vous soyez le pŤre.
Elle voulait
que j'interrompe la grossesse.
La procťdure est illťgale,
mais on peut le contourner.
Mais elle a dťcidť de le garder.
Plus tard, elle m'a demandť
un test de paternitť pour en Ítre sŻre.
Et c'ťtait pas moi.
Qui ?
Il l'ignore aussi.
Et il est hors de question
qu'il apprenne sa paternitť
par un ancien chef de pont furax
qui a une puce cylon dans l'ťpaule.
C'est moi qui lui dirai.
AprŤs Áa, vous pourrez
vous arranger entre vous.
Prenez soin de lui.
Gťnial.
La prťsidente ne rťpond plus
ŗ mes appels.
Elle traverse une mauvaise passe.
Comme nous tous.
Elle s'en remettra.
«a prend du temps.
On a besoin de connaÓtre rapidement
sa position sur la citoyennetť.
On en reparle plus tard.
Passez-moi la prťsidente.
Si on peut faire pencher
l'opinion de notre cŰtť...
ou au moins pas contre nous,
il pense qu'on peut gťrer
Zarek et le Quorum.
Il a sŻrement raison.
Mes courbatures !
- Tu es sŻre d'Ítre en ťtat ?
- Oui.
Je fais juste un peu d'aťrobic.
Je ne me suis pas sentie aussi bien
depuis des mois.
«a fait mal, mais c'est bon.
Quand est prťvu
ton prochain traitement au Doloxan ?
Demain.
Bien.
Lee pense, et je suis d'accord,
que tu devrais faire un discours.
Dťclarer publiquement
qu'une alliance avec les Cylons
est cruciale
pour notre survie ŗ long terme.
D'accord, mais plus tard.
J'ai besoin d'un peu de temps.
C'est ce que je lui ai dit.
On a besoin de toi.
Je sais que tu es fatiguťe,
mais on a besoin de toi.
Je comprends.
Vraiment, crois-moi.
Il me faut un peu de temps.
File.
File.
- N'en fais pas trop, d'accord ?
- Promis.
Capitaine Thrace.
Je suis pas d'humeur, Felix.
Rien ŗ foutre, de ton humeur.
Vas-y.
- T'as voulu de me passer par le sas.
- Tu pleures encore pour Áa ?
ņ l'ťpoque, j'ťtais accusť
de collaboration avec l'ennemi
en temps de guerre.
J'attends la chute.
Il s'avŤre que le jury qui m'a condamnť
ťtait constituť de deux Cylons
et de la femme d'un Cylon.
Roulement de tambour !
Gros fous rires et applaudissements.
C'est tout ?
Dťsolťe, j'oubliais.
On a pas encore parlť de la jambe.
50 milliards de morts
et je dois me soucier de ta jambe ?
- Qui les a tuťs, Kara ?
- Pas moi.
Non, c'ťtait ton mari.
«a t'excite ?
Tu prends ton pied comme Áa
en ce moment ?
Toujours le mÍme pied, je parie.
Qu'est-ce que Sam
faisait sur Caprica
avant de te rencontrer,
comme par hasard ?
Tu t'es jamais demandťe ?
Il a peut-Ítre fait exploser
une ville ou deux ?
Exťcutť quelques milliers
de prisonniers ?
Je me le demande.
Toi aussi, t'es peut-Ítre un Cylon.
Au moins, je suis pas ťclopťe.
Un jour, bientŰt,
Áa va nous retomber dessus, Kara.
Une fois de plus, les gens
devront rťpondre de leurs actes.
C'est une menace ?
Un peu, que c'est une menace.
Tu sais oý me trouver, Felix.
Au cas oý Áa t'intťresse,
je me ferai un estropiť,
sans hťsiter.
Ou n'importe qui d'autre.
T'es pas partante
pour te taper un infirme, alors ?
Fermez cette porte.
On va discuter.
Point de procťdure !
Point de procťdure,
s'il vous plaÓt !
Le prťsident de sťance
exerce son droit de motion.
En prison,
on commence ŗ confondre
les espoirs et les rÍves
avec la rťalitť.
On commence
ŗ croire que,
parce qu'on veut quelque chose,
la libertť conditionnelle,
une gr‚ce, l'appel, une assignation,
on commence ŗ croire
que Áa va arriver.
On vit de nos dťsirs,
de nos fantasmes,
en occultant le monde rťel.
Parce qu'on ne peut
affronter la rťalitť.
Nos dirigeants
prennent leurs dťsirs pour la rťalitť,
faute de pouvoir affronter
une rťalitť simple :
l'administration Roslin-Adama
ne nous a conduits nulle part.
La Terre ťtait un mirage,
un fantasme qu'ils nous ont fait
miroiter pendant 4 ans
pour garder le pouvoir.
Un fantasme qu'ils ont conÁu
pour contenir
et maintenir le gouvernement
malgrť les dťsirs lťgitimes
de toute la population.
ņ prťsent,
que font nos dirigeants
ineptes et dťcouragťs
pour consolider leur position
aprŤs nous avoir
misťrablement abandonnťs ?
Ils s'adressent aux Cylons.
Aux Cylons !
Pour leur demander de l'aide.
N'est-ce pas ŗ cause des Cylons
que nous sommes ici ?
Ne sont-ils pas nos ennemis ?
Ou deviennent-ils nos amis
pour aider Roslin et Adama
ŗ garder le pouvoir ?
Point de procťdure,
le prťsident de sťance digresse.
Merci, M. Adama.
Le conseil propose
que toute dťcision
autorisant les Cylons
ŗ aborder un vaisseau
soit prise par le capitaine
et les occupants du vaisseau,
et non par l'administration
Roslin-Adama.
Nous avons besoin d'unitť.
«a concerne toute la flotte.
Nous devons nous serrer les coudes.
- Sagittaron soumet la question.
- Tauron appuie.
La question a ťtť soumise et appuyťe.
Qui est pour ?
Qui est contre ?
Motion adoptťe ŗ 11 contre 1.
Aucun Cylon
ne montera ŗ bord d'un vaisseau
sans la permission de ses occupants.
Merci.
Quoi ?
Putain de merde. Le fils de...
C'est un grand vaisseau.
- Tu as couru tout du long ?
- La moitiť.
«a faisait longtemps
que je n'avais pas couru.
Tu es rouge.
- Tu as l'air en forme.
- Merci.
Tu n'es pas censťe Ítre en forme.
Tu es censťe Ítre ŗ l'infirmerie
avec une perfusion au bras.
J'ai changť d'avis.
Tu parles.
Tu n'as jamais eu
l'intention d'y aller.
Tu m'as eue.
Envoie-moi en cellule.
Je pourrais y courir.
Cottle dit que tu ťprouves
un moment d'euphorie
parce que ton corps se remet
de la toxicitť du traitement.
Tant pis pour le secret mťdical.
La santť de la prťsidente
est une question de sťcuritť.
Ma dťmission
sera sur ton bureau dans l'heure.
Je ne livrerai pas la prťsidence
ŗ Tom Zarek.
- Alors ma maladie le fera.
- ArrÍte.
On a besoin de toi.
Zarek encourage
la contestation du Quorum.
La presse se dťchaÓne.
Le gouvernement...
est hors de contrŰle.
En ce moment...
on a besoin de toi.
EnlŤve tes mains, Bill.
J'ai jouť mon rŰle
dans cette comťdie.
"Un leader mourant
conduira l'humanitť ŗ...
"bla, bla, bla," saloperie de...
bla-bla.
Je l'ai vťcu. Je l'ai fait.
Et maintenant ?
Ai-je un autre rŰle ŗ jouer,
pour le restant de mes jours ?
Tu te rappelles ce qu'on s'est dit
sur New Caprica ?
On parlait de vivre au jour le jour.
Tu devrais y songer, parce que...
demain ne viendra peut-Ítre pas.
Aujourd'hui est peut-Ítre
tout ce qui nous reste.
Et j'ai peut-Ítre...
peut-Ítre...
mťritť le droit de vivre un peu
avant de mourir.
Tu ne crois pas ?
Non ?
Je l'ai mťritť ?
Oui, tu l'as mťritť.
En effet.
Tu sais quoi†?
Toi aussi.
Laisse-moi passer.
Quelle espŤce de pardon...
recherchez-vous ?
Celui d'un enfant dťsobťissant ?
 tes-vous des enfants ?
Oui, ťvidemment, tu es un enfant.
Il y a des enfants ici,
mais pour le reste d'entre vous,
dans votre imagination,
n'Ítes-vous que des enfants
ayant enfreint
- la volontť divine de votre pŤre ?
- Non.
Nous n'avons rien fait de mal.
 tes-vous punis
pour vos innombrables pÍchťs ?
- L'Ítes-vous ?
- Non.
Est-ce vraiment notre sort ?
D'Ítre guidťs...
par un pŤre...
ŗ la Terre Promise.
Nous ne devrions pas
avoir ŗ souffrir.
- Continuez ŗ parler.
- Au paradis...
Uniquement pour voir le paradis
cruellement mis en piŤces
sous nos yeux ?
Est-ce le comportement d'un pŤre
- envers ses enfants ?
- Non.
C'est injuste.
Qu'avez-vous fait ?
Qu'avez-vous fait
pour mťriter pareil ch‚timent ?
Quels crimes avez-vous commis ?
<i>Quelles sombres pensťes
vous hantent et vous condamnent ?</i>
Vous condamnent...
ŗ errer dans l'univers,
sans espoir ?
Sans lumiŤre ?
Demandez-vous donc
quelle sorte de pŤre
abandonne ses propres enfants
au dťsespoir et ŗ la solitude ?
Aucun !
Peut-Ítre n'est-ce pas nous
qui avons besoin d'Ítre pardonnťs.
Peut-Ítre avons-nous ťtť trompťs !
Oui !
Peut-Ítre est-ce Dieu
qui devrait descendre parmi nous
et implorer notre pardon ?
N'ai-je pas raison ?
Criez-le ŗ Dieu !
Qu'as-tu fait pour moi derniŤrement ?
Oý ťtais-tu ?
Une maladie ronge ce vaisseau,
la maladie du reniement !
N'ai-je pas raison ?
Ce n'est pas ŗ moi qu'il faut le dire !
Criez-le ŗ Dieu !
Cottle m'a parlť. Je savais pas.
On doit... On devrait en parler.
L‚chez-moi !
Putain d'insurrection.
On n'en est pas encore lŗ, colonel,
mais on a un problŤme.
Un problŤme ? Dix vaisseaux refusent
un ordre direct du vaisseau amiral.
- Douze autres ne rťpondent pas.
- Mais ils ne font rien d'illťgal.
Le Quorum les a autorisťs ŗ refuser
les Cylons et leur technologie ŗ bord.
Amťliorer les moteurs FTL
est une dťcision militaire
qui n'est pas du ressort du Quorum.
Et vous seul en dťcidez ?
Oui, M. Gaeta.
C'est ŗ moi d'en dťcider.
«a vous pose un problŤme ?
Amiral, nous recevons
un message de dťtresse
du commandant des marines
ŗ bord du Hitei Kan.
L'ťquipage de la raffinerie de tylium
s'est mutinť.
Ils ont tuť un Cylon
et deux marines.
Envoyez le dťtachement de marines
et lancez le Raptor d'assaut.
<i>Ici, le XO.
Envoyez le dťtachement de marines.</i>
<i>Mutinerie ŗ bord du Hitei Kan.</i>
Le vaisseau raffinerie rompt
la formation et met en route ses FTL.
Je veux parler ŗ celui
qui dirige ce vaisseau, sur-le-champ.
Hitei Kan,
ici le Galactica. Rťpondez.
Ceci est un message prioritaire
du commandant du Galactica
au commandant en charge
de votre vaisseau.
Leurs FTL sont prÍts.
- Oý est mon groupe d'assaut ?
- Le Raptor dťcolle.
<i>Galactica, ici Athena.</i>
On quitte le pont,
en direction du Hitei Kan.
<i>Hitei Kan, ici le Galactica.
Rťpondez.</i>
- M. Hoshi !
- J'essaie, amiral, mais ils ne...
Attendez.
Ils communiquent avec Colonial One.
Roslin ?
Impossible, elle est sur le Galactica.
…coutons-les.
<i>Le dradis !</i>
<i>Un Raptor et des Vipers
se dirigent vers nous.</i>
<i>Ils approchent.</i>
<i>Ils ne peuvent vous aborder
sans votre autorisation.</i>
Le fils de pute.
<i>Que fait-on, M. le vice-prťsident ?</i>
<i>Un citoyen a le droit
de se protťger contre l'oppression.</i>
<i>Faites le nťcessaire.</i>
Ils ont sautť.
L'Hitei Kan a sautť.
Avec tout notre carburant.
Il y a des jours
oý je dťteste vraiment ce boulot.
Passez-les-moi.
Ici le commandant.
Je vous reÁois.
<i>Vous avez ordre
d'aborder le Colonial One,</i>
<i>de trouver et d'arrÍter
le vice-prťsident,</i>
et de l'amener sur le Galactica.
Compris, commandant.
L'arrÍter et le ramener.
Et s'il rťsiste ?
Dans ce cas,
<i>l'usage de la force est autorisť.</i>
Je sais pas ce que c'est,
d'Ítre un pŤre.
C'est nul.
La plupart du temps.
D'accord.
PremiŤre leÁon de paternitť.
Assieds-toi.
Ton fils est ŗ l'hŰpital,
tu le laisses jamais seul.
Quoi qu'il arrive.
Il faut quelqu'un en permanence.
Tu prends le premier tour...
Papa.
Attends.
Je reste longtemps ?
Jusqu'ŗ mon retour.
Quand j'aurai dessoŻlť.
Dťclarations sous serment.
…coutes radio.
Inventaires de cargaison.
Toutes sortes de documents
rassemblťs depuis un an.
Avec un seul sujet.
L'achat et la vente
de la vice-prťsidence.
Donc,
cette conversation va porter...
sur l'extorsion.
Sur la loi et l'ordre.
Mais appelez Áa comme vous voulez.
Je crois que...
vous iriez volontiers ŗ la potence,
ou croupir dans une cellule
le reste de votre vie,
si c'ťtait en tant que...
martyr pour votre cause.
Mais l'idťe d'Ítre...
humiliť publiquement,
en tant que politicien corrompu
pris sur le fait.
«a vous effraie.
Je ne pense pas
que la lťgende et le mythe
de Tom Zarek,
le prisonnier politique,
l'homme de principe,
survivrait ŗ un tel dťballage
de linge sale.
Et la flotte accepterait Áa
sans broncher ?
Un long procŤs,
aux motivations politiques,
pendant que vous vous alliez
avec les Cylons ?
Je pense surtout que sans tylium,
nous n'irons nulle part.
On va rester plantťs ici
trŤs longtemps.
Au moins, on ne s'ennuiera pas.
Et je saurais oý se trouve
le vaisseau raffinerie ?
- Je pense, oui.
- Pourquoi ?
Je le sais, c'est tout.
Lisez le dossier.
C'est savoureux.
La presse va se rťgaler.
Meurtre et extorsion.
Vous savez
ce qui nous diffťrencie, amiral ?
Vous portez l'uniforme
et pas moi.
Attendez bien sagement ici
pendant que je vťrifie.
Je vous dťconseille la nourriture.
- La localisation de la raffinerie.
- Rapide. Comment t'as fait ?
J'ai fait appel ŗ son intelligence.
- J'envoie un mťdecin ?
- Non, il va bien.
Pas toi. Tu devrais en voir un.
T'as l'air lessivť.
C'est clair.
J'ai besoin de repos.
Tu l'as mťritť.
Prťviens-moi quand on le trouvera.
Je serai avec la prťsidente.
Entendu.
Donne Áa ŗ Hoshi.
Qu'il les classe.
Les rapports de la blanchisserie ?
<i>Hitei Kan, ici Athena.</i>
Prťparez-vous ŗ Ítre abordťs.
En cas de rťsistance,
nous utiliserons nos armes.
Unique avertissement.
<i>Compris.</i>
Toutes les rťvolutions
dťbutent par un petit acte
de courage.
J'espŤre que vous percevez l'enjeu.
Que vous comprenez
que Áa aura des consťquences.
De terribles consťquences.
Pour beaucoup de monde.
J'ai pensť aux consťquences.
J'y suis prÍt.
Nous le sommes tous.
Vous Ítes nombreux ?
Suffisamment.
Une fois lancťs,
d'autres nous rejoindront.
Les gens savent qu'il faut agir.
Le monde est dingue.
Il marche sur la tÍte.
Quelqu'un doit arranger Áa.
 tes-vous cet homme ?
En partie.
Mais j'ai besoin...
d'un partenaire.
Vous l'avez.
Parfait. Prends la suite, Saul.
On se voit demain.
Ils ont retrouvť le tylium.
Tu t'en fiches ?
Moi aussi.
Bonne nuit.
<i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
Looks like Mommy's gonna get
some sleep tonight after all.
Stay the frak away from me!
I heard you. You're Cylons.
I know that you've been spending
a lot of time interrogating the Six.
I'm not torturing her,
if that's what you're worried about.
Cottle tells me she's pregnant.
You just gonna lie down and quit?
I was wrong about everything.
And all those people who listened
and trusted me,
they're dead.
We'll find a new home.
This is a promise
<i>I intend to keep.</i>
Get the Cylon baseship on the horn.
See if our new allies
want to come along for the ride.
"There is a languor of the life
"more imminent than pain.

I don't see anything.
- Wait, I see something.
- Where?
Right there. Wait. No?
- I thought I saw it.
- Saw what?
Everyone shut the frak up
for a second.
- Got it. There.
- Yeah, there it is.
I see it.
I can see it!
My God, there it is.
It's so beautiful.
I still don't see anything.
Try looking with your eyes...
eye.
Here, Colonel.
See, this is the head,
shoulder, and there's a little hand.
I'll be damned.
It's our baby, Saul.
Our baby.
I need a drink.
Here, next best thing.
That's a lot of smoking
around a pregnant lady.
She'll live.
Look at that, Saul.
Do you know what that is, really?
That's the future
of the entire Cylon race.
Kid doesn't even have a name yet and
already loading up on the expectations.
All he has to do is be born.
No Cylon/Cylon pairing
has ever produced a child ever.
Believe me, it's been tried.
That means it's...
That means it's possible for our race
to survive even without resurrection.
The Cylon nation will survive.
Ishay,
get me the fetal monitor. I want to
work up a complete biophysical profile
on this... savior.
Sorry, Felix.
He's backed up today,
but he shouldn't be much longer.
No problem. At least
the Cylons are having fun, right?
Earth's a cinder. Dee's dead.
Suicides are up. Fleet's a mess.
President's missing in action,
but, gotta make sure
the Cylons are taken care of.
Rub this into the skin and it'll help
with the drying and the chaffing,okay?
No, no, frak. I've gone through
two jars of that stuff already.
It doesn't do anything.
The end cap needs to be refitted.
I already told him it's too high
on one side, but he won't listen.
I'm sorry, Felix.
I'm really sorry.
I will get you in there
as soon as I can. It's just been crazy.
I need help!
I need help!
- It's busy today, chief.
- He's peeing blood.
It's gonna be awhile.
get him to bed three.
I'll go and get a Doctor.
- Sorry.
- No problem.
- Ishay, where's the damn fetal monitor?
- Can't keep those toasters waiting.
Right.
Admiral! Admiral!
Is Colonel Tigh still serving
as executive officer,
and aren't you concerned about
having a Cylon as second in command?
I'm not gonna discuss
military protocol or chain of command.
Is it true you're contemplating forming
a permanent alliance
with the rebel Cylons
currently in this fleet?
I'm not gonna talk
about hypotheticals.
Mr. Vice President,
would you support such a move?
No comment.
Serious! Unbelievable!
Where is President Roslin?
Thank you, Playa.
The President is resting comfortably
aboard Galactica.
Last question.
Yes, Seku.
Do you have any information
on the identity of the fifth Cylon?
We believe
the fifth Cylon to be dead.
But you're not sure.
No, but we believe
she died some time ag...
- She?
- How do you know it was a woman?
That was the last question.
Thank you all very much for coming.
- I can't believe I said that.
- What was that about?
- Forget about it.
- Permanent alliance between
this government and the Cylons,
any Cylons, Is out of the question.
- I hope you both know that.
- Yeah, it's not your call.
Is it yours?
Are you the President again?
Sorry, I get confused
what your job is on any given day.
Laura Roslin is still the President.
She'll make the final call.
And where is Laura Roslin?
That's right.
Resting comfortably aboard Galactica.
Funny how she dropped out of sight
ever since her prophecies about Earth
turned out to be a bunch of crap.
We're done here.
If you try to shove an alliance
with the Cylons down our throats,
there'll be consequences, Admiral.
I promise you.
Thank you, Mr. Zarek.
Makes it a little bit easier
to know who to hold responsible
if there's an unfortunate incident.
I'm not hard to find, Admiral.
I'm right here...
Running the government.
For now.
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-
The feeling on the baseship is
we'd rather take our chances with you
than risk running
into Cavil's forces alone.
- We?
- Yeah.
We... Cylons.
That description fit
anyone around here you know?
Have this discussion another time.
What about the FTL question?
It's possible.
It's labor-intensive,
a lot of grunt work,
but we should be able to upgrade
all the jump drives in the entire fleet
with Cylon technology.
Not gonna be easy
to sell the Quorum on this one.
Frak the Quorum.
These are civilian ships.
What are you gonna do?
Upgrade their engines at gunpoint?
We need the Quorum
to get civilian cooperation.
All right.
What'll it take
to get the Quorum to sign off?
The first issue is gonna be
whether we can make these upgrades
with Galactica personnel only.
It's one thing to accept
Cylon technology.
It's quite another to have
actual Cylons aboard their ships.
I barely understand this stuff,
and I'm...
We are gonna need teams
of Sharons and Sixes,
possibly Leobens,
just to do the installations.
- They'll go nuts.
- We gotta sell 'em on it.
Point out the benefits.
Athena tells me the upgrades
should triple the fleet's jump capacity.
Absolutely.
And that's conservative.
Their technology...
Our technology
is way ahead of ours...
Yours.
Maybe you'd like a chart
to keep it all straight.
- What do you think?
- Well...
Tripling jump capacity
triples our chances
of finding a habitable planet
before we run out of food and fuel.
- That I might be able to sell.
- What's the catch?
Because there is a catch, right,
former-chief?
We want to be part of the fleet.
Not just along for the ride.
Full members, citizens,
seat at the Quorum, the whole thing.
- Are you insane?
- It's non-negotiable.
You want Cylon technology.
We want safety
in case Cavil's forces arrive.
Now, if we're citizens,
your oath...
states that you protect us
just like everybody else.
And the other Cylons,
they really think
that that will guarantee your safety?
Yes, they do.
I've convinced them the Admiral takes
these sorts of things very seriously.
That he would rather lose the fleet
than break the oath.
Unlike certain other people.
Unlike certain other people.
I understand the argument.
It makes sense
from their perspective.
You're not seriously
thinking about this.
Sir.
You're not seriously
thinking about this, sir.
All options are on the table,
Mr. Gaeta.
This is a political decision.
I'll have to run it
by the President.
Thank you all.
Admiral, can I have a word?
Acute renal failure.
I think we caught it in time
to manage with dialysis.
However, there is a chance
that this could lead
to chronic renal failure.
And if that happens,
he's gonna lose a kidney.
What's the next step? What do I do?
Do I give some blood?
Build up a supply?
We have enough of his type
in the blood bank.
He's half-Cylon.
You got a lot of half-Cylon blood
just lying around, do you?
No, you're right.
I hadn't thought about that.
We should tap a vein
and start a supply right away.
This is ridiculous,
you have to tell him.
Tell me what?
This little boy could die.
- His father should know.
- Ishay, zip it!
What the hell is she talking about?
We'll talk about this later.
I guess you better come with me.
Hey, buddy. How's it going?
All right.
This is gonna be a shock.
But I want you to know
that I was bound
by Doctor-patient confidentiality
in this.
Even though she's dead now,
it's still applied.
Cally?
You're talking about Cally.
What the frak does she...
I'm not his father, am I?
I'm sorry.
She found out she was pregnant
just before you got married.
She wasn't sure
that you were the father.
She wanted me
to terminate the pregnancy.
The procedure is illegal,
but there are ways around it.
However, she decided to keep it.
Then later on she asked me
to do a paternity test
because she wanted to know.
And it wasn't me.
Who?
He doesn't know either.
And I'll be damned if he's gonna
find out that he's a father
from a pissed-off former deck chief
with a Cylon chip on his shoulder.
No, I'll have to tell him.
I'll tell him, and then the two of you
can work it out on your own.
Take care of him.
Great.
You know the President's stopped
returning my calls.
She's going through a rough patch.
We all are.
She'll get through it.
Just take time.
But we're gonna need to know
her stance on this citizenship thing
sooner rather than later.
I'll talk to you about it later.
Get me the President.
If we can sway public
opinion towards us...
Or, at least not against us...
He thinks that Zarek
and the Quorum can be handled.
He's probably right.
I'm so stiff.
- Are you sure you're up for this?
- Yeah, just...
I'm just stretching,
a little aerobics.
Truth is, I haven't felt
this good in months.
It hurts, but it's good.
When do you have to go in
for another Doloxan treatment?
Tomorrow.
Good.
Lee thinks, and I agree with him,
that you should address the fleet.
Make a public declaration
that an alliance with the Cylons
is critical
for our long-term survival.
Sure. Not just yet, though.
I need a little time.
That's what I told him.
We need you, Laura.
I know that you're tired,
but we need you.
I hear you.
I do, trust me.
I need a little time.
Go.
Go.
- Just don't overdo it, all right?
- I won't.
Captain Thrace.
Whatever it is,
I'm not in the mood, Felix.
Oh, so you think I should
give a frak about your mood.
Okay, let's have it.
- You tried to throw me out an airlock.
- Still crying about that?
The charges at the time were
collaborating with an enemy
in a time of war.
Waiting for the punch line.
It turns out the jury
that convicted me was made
of two Cylons
and a woman married to a Cylon.
Rim shot!
Big laugh, applause,
applause, applause.
Are we done?
Oh, no, wait. I'm sorry, I forgot.
We haven't gotten to the leg yet.
50 billion people are dead, and I'm
supposed to give a frak about your leg?
Who killed those 50 billion people?
- It wasn't me.
- No, it was your husband.
Are you enjoying yourself?
Is this how you get
your kicks these days?
Oh wait, I'm sorry.
I meant half-kicks.
What was Sam doing on Caprica
before he so conveniently met you?
You ever wonder?
You think maybe he...
nuked a few cities?
Executed a few thousand prisoners?
I'm just wondering.
Well, then again,
maybe you're a Cylon too.
At least I'm not a gimp.
One day, one day soon,
there's gonna be a reckoning, Kara.
And once again people are gonna
have to answer for what they've done.
Is that a threat?
You're godsdamn right
that's a threat.
Well, you know
where to find me, Felix.
And in case you're wondering,
I will definitely hit a cripple.
Or anyone else.
So I guess a pity frak's
out of the question then?
Somebody close that hatch.
Let's talk.
Point of order!
Point of order, please!
The chair exercises its right
to bring a motion forward.
In prison,
you start to confuse
your hopes and dreams
with reality.
You start to...
believe that because
you want something to happen...
parole, a pardon, appeal, a writ...
you start to believe
that it will happen.
You live on wishes.
The way things should be,
instead of the way they are.
And all because
you can't face reality.
The leaders of this fleet are
succumbing to wishful thinking
because they can't face reality.
And the reality is
that the Roslin-Adama administration
has led us nowhere.
Earth was a mirage,
a fantasy they dangled
in front of us for four long years
in order to maintain power.
A fantasy they dreamed up
as a way to hold on and control
the government
over the democratic
wishes of the population.
So now
what is our feckless
and dispirited leadership doing
to solidify their position
after failing us so miserably?
Turning to the Cylons.
The Cylons...
For help.
Aren't the Cylons the reason
we're out here in the first place?
Aren't they the enemy?
Or are they suddenly our friends
if that helps keep
Roslin-Adama in power?
Point of order. The chair needs
to bring a motion, not make a speech.
Thank you, Mr. Adama.
The chair moves that any decision
on allowing Cylons
to board any ship in this fleet
be made by the Captain
and the people living on that ship,
and not the Roslin-Adama
administration.
What we need right now is unity.
This is a fleet-wide issue.
We need to stand together.
It affects all of us.
Sagittaron calls the question.
Tauron seconds.
Question has been called and seconded.
All in favor?
All opposed?
Vote is 11 to 1.
Motion carries.
No Cylon will board a ship
in this fleet
without permission of its people.
Thank you.
What?
Mother-frakkin' son of a...
It's a big ship.
- You ran the whole route?
- Half.
It's more than I've run in...
a long time.
You're flushed.
- You look good.
- Thank you.
You're not supposed to look good.
You're supposed to be in sickbay
with a tube in your arm.
Changed my mind.
Like hell.
You never intended to go.
Caught.
Send me to the brig.
I can run there.
Cottle says you're experiencing
a moment of euphoria
as your body recovers
from the toxicity of the treatments.
So much
for Doctor-patient confidentiality.
Well, the President's health
is a security issue.
My resignation
will be on your desk in the hour.
I'm not gonna hand
the presidency over to Tom Zarek.
- Then the status quo will have to do.
- Stop it.
Listen, we need you.
Zarek's got the Quorum in an uproar.
The press is going crazy.
The government
is spinning out of control.
Now...
we need you.
Take your hands off me, Bill.
I've played my role in this farce.
"A dying leader
will guide the people to the...
"blah-blah-blah frakkin...
"blah-blah."
I've been there. I've done that.
Now what?
Is there another role
that I have to play
for the rest of my life?
Do you remember
what we said on new Caprica?
How we talked about trying
to live for today?
Well, you better think about that,
because...
maybe tomorrow really isn't coming.
Maybe today is all we have left.
And maybe...
Just maybe...
I've earned
the right to live a little
before I die.
Haven't I?
What do you think?
Haven't I?
Yes, you've earned it.
I have.
Well, guess what.
So have you.
Now get out of my way.
What manner of forgiveness
are you seeking?
Is it that of disobedient children?
Are you children?
Well, obviously you're a child.
We have some children here,
but to the rest of you,
in your mind's eye,
are you all just children
who've transgressed
- against your father's divine will?
- No.
We've done nothing wrong.
Are you being punished
for your multitude of sins?
- Are you?
- No.
Is this really our lot?
To have been led...
by a father...
to the promised land.
No. We shouldn't have to suffer.
- Just keep talking.
- To paradise...
Only to have paradise
cruelly smashed
to bits before our very eyes?
Are these the actions of a father
- towards his children?
- No.
It's not right.
What have you done?
What have you done
to deserve this punishment?
What sins have you committed?
<i>What dark thoughts have you harbored
that condemn you?</i>
Condemn you...
to wander through the universe
without hope?
Without light?
So you have to ask yourself
what kind of a father
abandons his own children
to despair and loneliness?
No father!
Perhaps we are not
the ones in need of forgiveness.
Perhaps we're not.
Perhaps we have been wronged!
Yes, we have!
Perhaps it is God
who should come down here
and beg for our forgiveness?
Am I right?
Am I right?
Well, shout it to God!
What have you done for me lately?
Where have you been?
There is a disease aboard this ship,
and it is a disease of denial!
Am I right? Well, don't tell me!
Shout it to God!
Cottle told me. I didn't know.
We need to... We should talk.
Get off me!
It's a godsdamn uprising.
I don't think we're there yet,
but we do have a problem.
A problem? Ten of our ships refuse
a direct order from the flagship.
- Another 12 won't respond to our hails.
- They're not doing anything illegal.
The Quorum gave them the right to refuse
any Cylon or Cylon technology aboard.
Jump drive upgrades
is a military decision
outside of the authority
of the Quorum.
And you alone get to make
that determination?
Yes, Mr. Gaeta.
I get to make that determination.
You have a problem with that?
Admiral, we're in receipt
of an emergency signal
from our marine commander
aboard the Hitei Kan.
The crew of the tylium ship
has mutinied.
They killed a Cylon and two marines.
Scramble the mardet alert team
and launch the assault Raptor.
<i>This is the XO.
Scramble the mardet alert team.</i>
<i>Mutiny aboard Hitei Kan.</i>
Admiral, tylium ship
is pulling out of formation,
spinning up their FTL drives.
I want to talk to whoever's
in charge of that ship right now.
Hitei Kan,
this is Galactica. Please respond.
This is a priority signal
from Galactica actual to the...
current commander of your ship.
Their drives are spooled up.
- Where's my assault team?
- Raptor's launching now.
<i>Galactica, Athena.</i>
We've cleared the bay
and are <i>en route</i> to Hitei Kan.
<i>Hitei Kan, this is Galactica.
Please respond.</i>
- Mr. Hoshi!
- I'm trying, but they're not...
Wait.
They're communicating
with Colonial One.
Roslin?
Can't be. She's aboard Galactica.
Let's hear it.
<i>The dradis!</i>
<i>The dradis shows a Raptor
and Vipers heading straight for us.</i>
<i>- They'll be here any minute.
- They have no right to board your ship</i>
<i>without your permission.</i>
Son of a bitch.
<i>What should we do,
Mr. Vice President?</i>
<i>Every citizen has the right
to protect themselves from oppression.</i>
<i>Take whatever measures
you think necessary.</i>
She jumped.
Hitei Kan has jumped away, sir.
Taking all our fuel with them.
You know, there are days
that I really hate this job.
Put me on scramble.
Athena.
Galactica actual.
I read you, actual.
<i>You're ordered to board
the Colonial One.</i>
<i>Locate and arrest
the Vice President,</i>
then bring him back to Galactica.
Roger that, actual.
Arrest and return to Galactica.
What are my orders if he resists?
In that case,
<i>the use of deadly force
is authorized.</i>
I don't know anything
about being a father.
It sucks.
Except for the parts that don't.
All right.
First lesson in parenting.
Sit.
Your kid's in the hospital,
you never leave him alone,
no matter what.
Someone's always here.
You get first shift...
Dad.
Wait.
How long do I sit here?
Until I get back.
That'll be after I sober up.
Sworn statements.
Transcripts of wireless conversations.
Shipping records.
All kinds of documents really.
Compiled over the last year
with one theme.
The buying and the selling
of the Vice President's office.
So this is a...
conversation about extortion.
About law and order.
But you can call it what you want.
You see, I believe that...
you would walk happily
to the gallows
or languish in a cell
for the rest of your life,
if you could do it as a...
martyr to your cause.
But the idea of being...
publicly humiliated,
as a corrupt politician
with your hand in the till.
Well, that would scare you.
Somehow I don't think
that the legend and the myth
of Tom Zarek, the political prisoner
and a man of conscience,
can survive the airing
of that much dirty laundry.
You really think the fleet
is going to sit still
for a long
and politically motivated trial
while you make an alliance
with the Cylons?
I think without the tylium ship,
we're not going anywhere.
We're gonna sit here
for a long time.
At least we won't be bored.
You think I know
where the tylium ship is?
- Yes, I do.
- Why?
Because I know that you do.
Read the file.
Some juicy stuff.
Make a great story for the press.
Murder and extortion.
You know what the difference is
between you and I, Admiral?
You wear that uniform
and I don't.
You can cool your heels here
until I check these out.
I wouldn't eat the food.
- Here's our tylium ship.
- That was fast. How did you do it?
I appealed to his intellect.
- Should I send in a medic?
- No, he's fine.
You're not. You should see a medic.
You look like hell.
I feel like it too. I need to rest.
You earned it.
Let me know when they find the ship.
I'll be with the President.
You got it.
Give this to Hoshi.
Tell him to file it.
Laundry reports?
<i>Hitei Kan, this is Athena.</i>
Stand by to be boarded.
Any resistance will be met with force.
This is your only warning.
<i>Understood.</i>
Every revolution
begins with one small act
of courage.
But I hope you know
how serious this is.
I hope you understand that this
will have consequences.
Deadly consequences.
For a lot of people.
I've thought about the consequences.
I'm ready.
We all are.
How many is "we"?
Enough.
But once it starts,
we'll get more support.
People know
something has to be done.
The world is frakked.
It's upside-down.
And somebody's
gotta turn it right-side up.
Are you that man?
I'm one of them.
I need...
a partner.
You've got one.
That's good.
Take it from here, Saul.
See you in the morning.
They found the tylium ship.
Do you care?
Neither do I.
Good night.
<i>Précédemment dans</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
- Et pour les FTL ?
- C'est possible.
Ça sera long et rébarbatif,
mais on devrait pouvoir améliorer
les moteurs FTL de la flotte entière
avec la technologie cylon.
Le Quorum aura du mal à avaler ça.
La question a été soumise.
Qui est pour ?
Qui est contre ?
Motion adoptée à 11 contre 1.
Aucun Cylon n'embarquera sur un vaisseau
sans la permission de ses occupants.
Dix vaisseaux refusent
un ordre direct du vaisseau amiral.
Douze autres ne répondent pas.
C'est leur droit.
Améliorer les moteurs FTL
est une décision militaire.
Et vous seul en décidez ?
Oui, M. Gaeta.
Ça vous pose un problème ?
Le vaisseau raffinerie rompt
la formation et allume ses FTL.
Hitei Kan a sauté.
Avec tout notre carburant.
Je saurais où est
le vaisseau raffinerie ?
Je pense, oui.
<i>Hitei Kan, ici Athena.</i>
<i>Préparez-vous à être abordés.</i>
Le monde est dingue.
Il marche sur la tête.
Quelqu'un doit arranger ça.
- Êtes-vous cet homme ?
- En partie.
- Mais j'ai besoin d'un partenaire.
- Vous l'avez.
Toute révolution
naît d'une étincelle.
Fermez cette porte.
On va discuter.
6 H 20 - QUARTIERS DE L'AMIRAL
Il est frais. T'en veux une tasse ?
Depuis qu'ils le font à base d'algue,
je peux plus l'avaler.
Trois capitaines civils de plus
piquent leur crise
et refusent d'accueillir
des Cylons à leur bord.
Je croyais que c'était réglé.
Pas sur le vaisseau raffinerie.
Ils crient à qui veut l'entendre
qu'ils ont été illégalement
appréhendés par nos marines.
J'en ai ma claque.
Vois avec Lee.
Dites au Quorum que si leurs vaisseaux
n'obtempèrent pas,
il y a de la place
dans la cellule de Zarek.
- J'interviendrai, mais...
- Ça sent bon.
Bonjour, colonel.
- Madame la présidente.
- Comment allez-vous ?
Tu disais, Saul ?
C'est juste que...
vu l'attitude de la flotte
vis-à-vis des Cylons...
tu devrais pas me mettre
en première ligne.
J'arrive tout de suite.
6 H 32 - CELLULE DU GALACTICA
M. le vice-président.
Les rumeurs vont bon train.
- Ça sera difficile à contenir.
- La flotte est le cadet de mes soucis.
Vous pouvez y aller.
Connor a appelé.
On a accès à l'armurerie.
- Le pont C ?
- Narcho et Paley le contrôlent.
Allons-y, caporal.
Notre plus gros problème
reste le Quorum.
Vous pouvez les isoler
quelques heures, mais...
Ils gesticuleront,
mais le sens des réalités
aura raison du sens du devoir,
- à une exception près.
- On en a déjà parlé.
Le fils de l'amiral
est imprévisible.
Manipulez-le.
On dit que c'est votre spécialité.
Le colonel a raison.
La flotte n'a jamais
vraiment accepté
cette amnistie générale des Cylons.
Ce café est imbuvable.
Envoyer Lee au Quorum
sera perçu comme un coup de semonce.
Quoi qu'il fasse, les délégués
sauront que tu en es l'instigateur.
Lee s'en sortira.
En effet, toi aussi.
Et je ne m'impliquerai pas.
Vous êtes assez grands
pour vous en sortir tout seuls.
Comme ça, je n'ai pas à revenir.
Le légendaire silence Adama.
Il n'a pas de secrets pour moi.
Avec ton air passif-agressif,
tu prétends admettre
que je ne m'implique pas.
Le passif-agressif,
c'est pas mon truc.
Si, mais sans le savoir.
Repose-toi.
- Du repos ?
- J'essaierai de rentrer pour le dîner.
Il t'attendra.
Cantrell est la clé. Dis-le à Lee.
S'il peut convaincre Cantr...
Je ne suis pas la clé.
Putain de merde !
J'ai une fuite de carburant !
Ça risque de sauter.
Tout le monde évacue, tout de suite.
Vite !
Situation ?
Le transpondeur du Raptor est coupé
et vous avez le feu vert pour décoller.
C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
Ce vaisseau est en attente
en cas de transport médical d'urgence,
pas pour faire la navette VIP.
L'officier de pont devait vous prévenir,
cet oiseau a été autorisé à décoller.
J'ai pas reçu d'ordre.
Les nouvelles missions priment.
L'amiral pense que Zarek
risque sa vie sur le Galactica.
Vu son statut controversé,
on le transfère sur Colonial One.
Entendu.
Dès confirmation du CIC.
Je viens de vous la donner.
L'amiral veut éviter les fuites.
Désolé, mais votre parole
ne suffit pas.
Bon débarras.
Cet enfoiré léchait le cul d'Adama
depuis son transfert du Pegasus.
Il y en aura d'autres.
- Montez à bord.
- Attendez.
- Il faut...
- Je sais ce qu'il vous faut.
Je sais aussi
ce qu'est une révolution.
Le succès ne repose pas
sur de grands idéaux ou sur la volonté,
mais sur une séquence d'événements
et la moindre hésitation
peut nous coûter la victoire.
J'ai lancé ça
et j'irai jusqu'au bout.
Maintenant,
grimpez dans ce vaisseau.
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA
Saison 4 - Épisode 13
39 643 SURVIVANTS
À LA RECHERCHE D'UN FOYER
Sous-titres
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-
Colonel Tigh, situation ?
La CAP est sortie.
Aucun contact ennemi sur le dradis.
La flotte est encore en train de gober
les foutaises anticylon de Zarek.
Lee essaie de remuer le Quorum,
mais faut creuser profond
pour dénicher une paire de couilles
dans ce ramassis.
Je vois un décollage,
mais j'ai rien sur le manifeste.
Laird a dû changer les horaires
sans les transmettre.
Cherche la mise à jour.
Nowart rassemble tous les marines
encore capables d'utiliser une arme.
Si tu en as marre de menacer en l'air
ces enfoirés, t'as qu'un mot à dire.
Hitei Kan était un cas à part.
Si on doit tirer
pour entrer sur chaque vaisseau,
on peut dire adieu à cette alliance.
Rien.
J'appelle le pont pour vérifier.
Attends. T'as autorisé ce lancement ?
Je vois pas de code radio.
Il y a un problème ?
On a un décollage non identifié.
Pas de transpondeur.
Je pense à un signal fantôme.
- J'ai pas besoin de ça.
- Quatre ans sans réparation,
l'équipement n'est plus très précis.
M. Gaeta, lancez
un diagnostic complet du dradis.
Tout de suite, monsieur.
7 H 41 - SESSION D'URGENCE
Silence, silence !
Je vous rappelle
que M. Zarek a été placé en détention
parce qu'il troublait l'ordre public.
Ces FTL cylons sont essentiels
si la flotte veut
continuer d'avancer.
M. le vice-président.
Ne soyez pas si surpris, Lee.
Même votre père sait
quand il mène un combat perdu d'avance.
Je prends le relais.
- J'étais fort à ce jeu avant.
- Ah oui ?
Réussir le bon tir.
Gagner le grand match.
Dire qu'avant,
je trouvais ça important.
Notre ancienne vie
dans les colonies...
Maintenant,
ça me paraît être un rêve.
Et plus on s'en éloigne...
Bon sang, je me souviens
quand on était tous les 2 au bar de Joe,
à enchaîner les verres,
à jouer à la pyramide.
C'était le bon vieux temps.
N'est-ce pas ?
Je croyais sincèrement
qu'il y avait un truc entre nous.
Et comme rien ne se faisait,
je me demandais : "Ça vient de moi ?"
- Non, Diana, j'étais...
- Maintenant, je crois que non.
C'était autre chose.
Un truc de Cylon.
Ta programmation.
Je sais, ça date pas d'hier,
mais j'arrive pas à l'oublier.
Plus tard !
On le tient.
Plus tard.
Soldat Jaffe.
Sauvegardez ça.
Bien, monsieur.
Alerte incendie sur le pont C
près du réseau d'antennes.
Envoyez le contrôle des avaries
sur le pont C.
Qu'ils me fassent leur rapport
au plus vite.
Bien, monsieur.
Amiral, si le réseau radio lâche,
la flotte ne pourra plus communiquer.
Compte tenu de la situation,
ce feu n'est peut-être pas
un accident.
Les partisans de Zarek s'en donneraient
à coeur joie en cas de coupure.
Très bien.
Que l'unité anti-incendie
accompagne le contrôle des avaries
et prépare l'évacuation du pont C.
Bien, monsieur.
Regardez-moi ce fier papa.
J'ai eu raison
de te surnommer "Hotdog".
- Lâche-moi.
- Fais pas ton timide.
Le grand Brendan Constanza
devait bien avoir d'autres conquêtes.
Tu t'es tapé la moitié de la flotte.
Ça t'a apporté quoi ?
<i>Votre attention,
incendie dans le compartiment C.</i>
<i>Évacuez les sections 29 à 42.</i>
Narcho.
Vous avez entendu l'alerte, capitaine.
Évacuez. Je suis responsable.
Un pilote responsable
au contrôle des avaries ?
- Je te parle...
- Vire tes sales pattes.
Putain.
Plus personne ne sait ce que tu es.
Fils de pute.
Emportez tout ce que vous pouvez
au hangar de pont.
Toi, emmène ces 4 personnes
sur le pont D.
Si on te demande, c'est la procédure.
Ordre de l'amiral.
<i>Gaeta, CIC.</i>
- Ici Starbuck, passe-moi l'amiral.
- Il est occupé.
Bon sang,
il y a des civils qui s'arment ici !
<i>Gaeta, CIC.</i>
Ici Lee Adama.
Passez-moi mon père.
Navré, Lee, on a une petite urgence.
<i>C'est sérieux ?</i>
Le contrôle des avaries s'en occupe,
mais vous connaissez l'amiral.
Je le croyais.
Vous pouvez peut-être m'aider.
Vous savez
pourquoi Tom Zarek a été libéré ?
Libéré, quand ça ?
<i>Super. D'abord,
il me dit de menacer les délégués,</i>
- puis il libère Zarek dans mon dos.
- <i>Je comprends pas non plus.</i>
Je lui dirai que vous avez appelé
dès son retour.
Des problèmes à la maison ?
Vous n'avez pas l'air heureux
de me voir.
Content que vous soyez sorti.
Mon père est allé trop loin
en vous faisant arrêter.
Mais j'espère que vous avez
changé d'avis pour les FTL.
On en a besoin.
C'est ce que pense l'amiral.
Vous voulez le beurre
et l'argent du beurre.
Honorer votre père,
tout en respectant votre serment
de représentant de Caprica,
il faut choisir.
Vous savez pourquoi il m'a relâché ?
Parce que je ne suis une menace
que s'il reconnaît l'autorité civile.
Notre expérience démocratique
touche à sa fin, j'en ai peur.
Adama l'entretenait jusqu'à présent
à cause de Roslin.
Mais depuis
qu'elle a abdiqué le trône...
Il ne ferait pas ça.
Vraiment ?
Il l'a déjà fait auparavant.
Quelle excuse a-t-il donnée
pour refuser de prendre votre appel ?
- Vous partez ?
- Sur le Galactica. Pour vous démentir.
Plus de communication
dans le vaisseau.
- Passez sur le secondaire.
- Il est mort. Celui de secours aussi.
L'incendie s'intensifie.
Défaillances systèmes en cascade.
Les deux réseaux
ont lâché en même temps ?
Le contrôle des avaries ne peut pas
relayer le statut de l'incendie.
<i>Galactica, répondez.</i>
<i>Galactica, vous me recevez ?</i>
Vous voulez dire
qu'il n'y a plus de communications ?
Qu'est-ce qui...
J'ignore de quoi il s'agit,
mais c'est une grossière erreur.
C'est ça, on est un peu perdus.
On devrait faire un procès
pour mettre un peu d'ordre.
Après quatre ans de combat
contre ces machines,
vous pensiez réellement
faire un marché avec eux ?
Et ils sont où,
vos précieux Cylons, là ?
Croyez-moi, je suis morte une fois :
c'est pas marrant.
- Lâchez-le.
- Va te faire foutre.
Je peux continuer !
À qui le tour ? Racetrack ?
Connor ?
Relâchez-le.
Il faut qu'on foute le camp.
Kara, maintenant.
Suivez-moi.
S'il vous plaît.
Tiens bon. Ça va aller.
Je sais, c'est un peu beurk.
Je mettrai plus de sucre
la prochaine fois.
Sharon, tu devrais
l'emmener à la crèche.
- Prends Hera...
- Ici !
- Allez-y, attrapez-la !
- Du calme.
Prenez-moi et laissez-les.
Faites-la sortir d'ici.
Tu te souviens de moi ?
Sur le Pegasus ?
Toi et Tyrol, le toaster,
vous avez zigouillé mon pote Thorne.
C'est pas ce qu'on voulait.
Vous aviez le choix,
mais vous avez préféré la synthétique.
Et pour couronner le tout,
plutôt que te passer par le sas,
ton amiral graisseur de Cylons
t'a promu CAG.
- Va te faire foutre.
- Désolé.
Je me réserve
pour ton toaster de femme.
9 H 02 - MAGASIN 5-3A-01
Skulls, Racetrack ?
J'ai volé avec eux.
Putain de fidélité.
Merde. Connor disait
qu'ils étaient sur tous les ponts.
Le hangar de pont n'est que le début.
Ils veulent le vaisseau.
- Zarek m'a bien eu.
- Il a dû se faire de nouveaux amis.
Avec une sacrée puissance de feu.
Des Vipers, des Raptors, des batteries.
On peut pas faire ça tout seuls.
Pour l'instant,
on peut compter que sur nous-mêmes.
Respire, Lee.
Ça fait du bien d'être en vie, non ?
- C'était quoi, ça ?
- Je me sens enfin moi-même.
Kara, mon père. Il est où ?
Il était au CIC
quand on a perdu les coms.
Il se rendra pas sans se battre.
- La présidente ?
- Je sais pas.
- OK, viens avec moi.
- On y va.
Ils ont quoi, là-bas, un feu de forêt ?
Où sont mes rapports d'avaries ?
Les capteurs sont toujours rouges,
mais les relevés gazeux
ne collent pas.
Ils sont normaux.
Si ça brûlait, là-bas,
le taux de monoxyde de carbone
exploserait.
Si le feu a endommagé les capteurs,
nos relevés sont probablement faux.
Sans les coms,
on ne peut rien vérifier.
J'en ai assez d'être aveugle.
Soldat Jaffe, foncez au pont C.
Récupérez les rapports d'avaries
et revenez vite.
Oui, monsieur.
Lâchez-le.
À très bientôt.
Ils vont nous tuer.
T'as quelque chose
pour stopper l'hémorragie ?
Oui.
Tu vois pas ?
Nos enfants représentent
tout ce que les humains haïssent.
Sans la résurrection,
le fait que la race cylon peut survivre
par la reproduction naturelle,
- ça les terrifie.
- Ça suffit.
Tu lui fais peur.
Pour l'instant,
ils doivent nous garder en vie
pour négocier
avec les rebelles cylons.
Surtout toi.
Si t'attends un éclair de sagesse,
laisse tomber.
J'ai pas plus de réponses que toi.
Garde ça pour toi.
Non, ils arrivent.
On va vers eux, maintenant.
On peut pas les tenir à distance.
Allez, vite !
Il nous faut plus de munitions.
Amiral, le matériel et les détecteurs
ont été trafiqués.
Sergent, faites venir vos marines,
que personne ne passe !
À quoi vous jouez, putain ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Ne tirez pas ! Cessez le feu !
Ne tirez pas !
Personne ne tire sans mon ordre !
Dites-leur de baisser les armes.
- Fils de pute !
- À terre, colonel !
Tous !
À terre !
- Vous avez tué ce garçon.
- Amiral Adama,
je vous retire le commandement.
Je vous arrête pour trahison.
Vous avez prêté serment
en endossant cet uniforme.
Vous avez juré de défendre
ce vaisseau et son équipage.
Vous avez prêté le même serment.
Et votre allégeance ?
J'ai fait mon boulot pendant 7 ans,
et pour quoi ?
Pour recevoir des ordres d'un Cylon,
laisser des machines nous infiltrer ?
Vous n'êtes plus le dirigeant
que vous étiez au départ.
Vous n'êtes qu'un vieillard
aveuglé par son coeur
et son affection pour un Cylon.
Comprenez bien ceci.
Si vous faites ça,
il n'y aura pas de pardon.
Pas d'amnistie.
Ce garçon
est mort en honorant son uniforme.
Vous...
Vous mourrez sans rien.
Sergent,
arrêtez les gradés et mettez l'amiral
et le colonel en état d'arrestation.
Allez !
- Monsieur.
- Ne me touchez pas !
S'il vous plaît, monsieur.
Emparez-vous de lui.
C'est pas normal.
Où sont les gardes ?
- Madame, vous allez bien ?
- Ça va.
Entrez.
Il y a eu un soulèvement. J'ignore
à quel point l'équipage est impliqué.
- C'est général.
- Votre père doit être au courant.
- Les marines peuvent les arrêter ?
- Il aurait dû y en avoir à la porte.
Nous risquons de perdre le vaisseau.
Par les Dieux. Bill...
Je ne sais pas. Sans communication,
on pourra pas contacter le CIC.
Ça dépasse le Galactica.
Zarek est déjà sur le Colonial One.
Il veut la présidence.
Bien sûr, foutu Zarek.
Il a toujours eu
des idées dangereuses.
On peut encore l'arrêter.
Dites à la flotte de se calmer.
- Les gens vous écouteront.
- Je mettrai tout en oeuvre.
Je ne laisserai Tom Zarek
devenir président
sous aucun prétexte.
J'ai une idée pour la radio.
L'intercom remarche.
Il y a des combats
près de la salle des machines.
Envoyez Redwing et ses marines.
Cette zone doit être sécurisée.
Technicien Gage...
Restez concentré.
Entassez-les ici.
Ils ne rentreront pas par cette porte.
Allez, on se presse.
Ils peuvent arriver n'importe quand.
Comprenez bien que je n'ai
aucune envie de vous quitter.
Absolument aucune envie.
Mais je dois partir.
S'ils veulent quelqu'un, c'est bien moi.
- Vous serez en sécurité.
- Non, c'est notre faute,
car on ne peut pas vous protéger
et j'en suis navrée.
Votre vaisseau sera bientôt là.
Prenez ça. Et sachez
que je prierai pour que vous reveniez
sain et sauf, d'accord ?
Je suis profondément...
Bien.
D'accord.
M. Tyrol ?
Vous êtes vraiment sûr
que mon départ est nécessaire ?
Je n'ai que les infos de Jeanne.
On a perdu le pont.
Le CIC et l'armurerie suivront.
Personne ne sera en sécurité.
Attendez.
On devrait s'en aller bientôt,
alors...
- Parlez.
- Et prendre des armes, non ?
Parce que...
Jeanne, je ne veux pas de la statue.
Garde la statue. Garde-la.
RAS.
- Madame la présidente...
- C'est bon, ils me connaissent.
Je dois parler au Dr Baltar.
- Non, vous n'êtes pas la bienvenue ici.
- Laisse, je m'en occupe.
- Allez.
- Je dois voir Baltar.
Je dois vous dire quelque chose.
J'ai des gens dans le vaisseau
qui me donnent des infos.
On vient d'emmener l'amiral
hors du CIC.
- Où ça ?
- Aucune idée. Je dirais en cellule.
N'utilisez pas les communications.
On utilise ça.
On a perdu le pont.
Si vous emmenez votre père
à l'entrepôt secondaire dans l'heure,
- il pourra quitter le vaisseau.
- Je m'occupe de la flotte, allez-y.
Galen...
Pourquoi ?
Le patron mérite mieux
que ce qu'ils lui réservent.
Trouvez votre père.
Nowart, c'est ça ?
- Affirmatif.
- Vous me disiez quelque chose.
Vous avez risqué votre vie
quand on a pris New Caprica.
C'était tendu, là-bas.
- On s'en bat, des histoires de guerre.
- Je vous connais aussi, Maldonado.
Grande-gueule,
pas un très bon soldat.
Ça n'a aucune importance.
Quand tout ça sera fini,
on règlera les comptes.
Et que vous soyez mort ou vif,
ce sont vos actes d'aujourd'hui
qui seront décisifs.
Ça sera quoi pour vous, Nowart ?
Ne faites pas ça.
C'est pas demain la veille qu'un type
comme toi m'expulsera de mon vaisseau.
Tu veux tirer ? Vas-y.
On va voir si t'as des couilles.
Désolé, désolé.
Les mains dans le dos.
- Ça va, Saul ?
- Je survivrai. On fait quoi de lui ?
Je pense...
qu'il va nous accompagner.
<i>Mais je dois évidemment
revenir le plus vite possible...</i>
- Vous allez quelque part ?
- Oui, en effet.
Ils considèrent ça
comme une mesure de précaution.
Raisonnable...
vu la situation délicate de la flotte.
Très raisonnable,
vu que la flotte s'entre-déchire.
- Vous êtes venue prier ?
- J'ai plus concret à vous proposer.
On a une chance de contenir le massacre
si je parle à la flotte
et que je leur assure
que les Cylons sont inoffensifs.
Votre foi en vos talents d'oratrice
est impressionnante.
J'aimerais vous aider,
mais malheureusement,
- les communications sont hasardeuses.
- Je sais que vous avez une radio.
Vous l'utilisez pour communiquer
avec vos ouailles depuis des mois.
- C'est un piège, Gaius.
- J'aurais préféré.
Elle a peur de vos enseignements.
Elle va prendre la radio...
Très bien, d'accord, Paulla...
Merci.
Elle n'a pas tort.
Si vous pouvez convaincre la flotte,
pourquoi pas elle ?
Je n'ai jamais vraiment cru
à votre conversion,
alors je comptais
sur votre sens aiguisé de la survie.
Vos insinuations
m'insupportent vraiment.
Je me rappelle votre soudaine allégeance
à Elosha et aux rouleaux de la Pythie
la dernière fois
que vos affaires allaient mal.
Dites-moi.
Ça marche pour vous, en ce moment ?
Si ça peut vous faire plaisir,
nous sommes peut-être deux imposteurs
et c'est notre dernière chance
de nous racheter.
Des civils barricadent
la réserve de poupe.
J'y vais.
Gaeta veut qu'on aide Redwing
en salle des machines.
Ils ont tué 4 civils,
mais il y a encore de la résistance.
On a besoin
de plus de puissance de feu.
Vous nous emmeniez où ?
En cellule.
Gaeta veut enfermer
les gradés et les Cylons...
On pourrait y trouver des alliés.
Debout.
Monsieur,
les capitaines appellent.
Ils demandent pourquoi
le Galactica ne répond pas.
Mettez-les sur haut-parleur.
Tous.
Et ouvrez une ligne sécurisée
avec Tom Zarek.
- <i>Le Galactica est muet.</i>
- <i>Amiral Adama, vous nous recevez ?</i>
- <i>Ils vont encore sauter ?</i>
- <i>Qui commande le Galactica ?</i>
- <i>J'ai pas confiance en Adama.</i>
- <i>Quelqu'un est en contact avec le Co...</i>
J'ai le Colonial One.
M. Zarek,
<i>j'ai pris possession du Galactica.</i>
<i>L'amiral et son état-major
sont prisonniers.</i>
- Adama est vivant ?
- <i>Vous semblez déçu.</i>
C'est secondaire.
Vous devez avoir vos raisons.
<i>Les félicitations sont de rigueur.</i>
<i>Avec l'avenir de la flotte en jeu,
vous avez fait preuve de courage.</i>
On débriefera
nos impressions plus tard.
Je rétablis actuellement
nos communications
- <i>et la flotte gronde.</i>
- Ne vous inquiétez pas, ils suivront.
- <i>Surtout quand je leur...</i>
- <i>Membres de la flotte,</i>
- <i>ici votre présidente.</i>
- Quoi ?
<i>Ce moment est décisif
dans notre long et douloureux voyage.</i>
Tom, vous entendez ça ?
Allumez la radio.
<i>De toutes mes décisions...</i>
- La source ?
- Aucune idée.
... la présidence,
la plus effrayante
et la plus difficile
fut d'accepter cette alliance
avec les Cylons.
Nous sommes à la croisée des chemins
dans notre long
et douloureux voyage.
Cylons et Hommes ne connaissent
que la guerre depuis des générations.
Nous sommes prisonniers d'une lutte
qui a vu les deux camps souffrir
d'incommensurables pertes.
Nos ressources s'épuisent,
<i>nos options sont limitées,</i>
<i>et notre ancien ennemi
pourrait bien être notre dernier,</i>
<i>voire notre seul espoir.</i>
<i>À ceux de la flotte...</i>
Trouvez la fréquence, Gage.
<i>... qui rejettent cette alliance,
je demande...</i>
Isolez le signal !
- Comment ?
- Bon sang.
<i>Je vous supplie d'y réfléchir</i>
<i>et d'avoir confiance en ceux</i>
qui vous ont mené si loin,
et de rejeter les traîtres
qui instrumentalisent
votre peur des Cylons
<i>pour détruire
la civilisation coloniale...</i>
<i>- Présidente Roslin, vous nous recevez ?
- Galactica ?</i>
Monsieur,
le vice-président.
10 H 17 - ACCÈS À LA SALLE
DES MACHINES AUXILIAIRES
J'ai pas pu approcher les cellules.
En admettant qu'il y soit.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Allons-y.
Ça va, Lee.
On n'a rien.
Dieux merci.
C'est qui ?
- Starbuck.
- Un prisonnier.
- Baisse ton arme.
- Ils ont pris le vaisseau.
C'est la seule façon
de le récupérer.
On n'a pas le temps
de faire des prisonniers.
Hors de ma vue.
Pars !
Ce ne sont plus vos hommes,
ce sont des ennemis.
10 H 21 - SOUTE SECONDAIRE
Qui l'eût cru ?
Vous le connaissiez
mieux que personne sur New Caprica.
Manifestement, sa loyauté
était déjà partagée à l'époque.
Nous partageons le même talent
pour choisir nos aides de camp,
n'est-ce pas ?
10 H 23 - STOCKAGE DES EAUX USÉES
- Combien d'hommes suivent Gaeta ?
- Suffisamment.
Stop.
Au milieu de ce bazar,
vous croyez que Tyrol
va trouver une sortie ?
- À vous de le dire, il est des vôtres.
- Un problème ?
Ouais, j'ai un problème.
Les vôtres ont annihilé
la race humaine.
Laisse causer le grand homme d'État.
Vous savez pourquoi Tom Zarek
suscite tant de respect ?
En dépit de son arrogance,
il a raison.
On peut faire semblant d'oublier,
échanger des amabilités sur l'alliance,
- c'est ça, la survie ?
- C'est tout ce qu'on a. Calme-toi.
C'est tout ce qu'ils nous laissent.
Le sas de la soute secondaire
est par là. Allons-y.
CIC.
Quoi ?
C'est Baltar.
- Que voulez-vous, Gaius ?
- Ce que je veux ?
Je veux que ça s'arrête...
immédiatement.
C'est de la folie.
<i>Ça ne se fait pas,
vous savez, la trahison.</i>
<i>Ou quel que soit
le nom qu'ils lui donneront.</i>
Je vous connais, Felix.
Je sais que vous êtes
quelqu'un de bien et d'honorable.
Vous voulez bien faire.
<i>Même vos échecs se justifient.</i>
Comme servir
votre gouvernement corrompu ?
<i>Vous savez ce que je veux dire.</i>
Notre petit secret,
très bien gardé.
<i>Mais je vous pardonne, Felix.</i>
<i>Je vous l'assure,</i>
<i>si vous cherchez la rédemption,
vous faites fausse route.</i>
- Au revoir, Gaius.
<i>- Felix, écoutez-moi...</i>
- Quelle est la mission du Raptor 619 ?
- Transport depuis le vaisseau cylon.
Ils auraient déjà dû
contacter l'officier de pont.
Ils ne vont pas au hangar de pont.
10 H 32 - SAS DE LA SOUTE SECONDAIRE
On est prêts.
Content de vous voir, M. Tyrol.
J'avais oublié cet endroit.
Comme nous tous.
C'est condamné depuis New Caprica,
mais je l'ai remis en service pour ça.
Je suis venue parce que...
je ne veux pas
que tu t'inquiètes pour moi.
Je sais ce que tu as à faire.
<i>Ici section 12, répondez.</i>
Parlez.
<i>Un commando de marines vient de passer.
On dirait qu'ils viennent vers vous.</i>
On a 2 min.
M. Tyrol, raccompagnez-les.
Colonel, vous les suivez.
Je te laisse pas tomber.
- Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
- Nous allons couvrir
le départ de la présidente.
<i>Séquence de lancement initiée.</i>
Ouvrez.
Amiral, Mme la présidente,
s'il vous plaît.
Allez, ouvrez-la.
Préparez-vous.
Le Raptor s'est séparé
d'un sas de poupe.
Pas de réponse.
- Gage, qui est de CAP ?
- Hotdog, Narcho...
Contactez Narcho.
Sécurisez la communication.
Vos ordres ?
Activer les armes, engager la cible
et la détruire.
Tu aurais pu la suivre.
Mais pas vivre avec ça.
Allez ! On y va !
Servir avec toi fut un honneur,
mon ami.
Donnez-moi ça, soldat.
À couvert.
Grenade !
À SUIVRE
Merci de suivre Battlestar Galactica
avec nos sous-titres
<i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
- What about the FTL question?
- It's possible.
It's labor intensive.
Lotta grunt work but we should be able
to upgrade the jump drives of
the entire fleet with Cylon technology.
Not gonna be easy to sell
the Quorum on this one.
Question has been called.
All in favor.
All opposed.
The vote is 11 to 1. Motion carries.
No Cylon will board a ship in this fleet
without permission of its people.
Ten of our ships refuse a direct order
from the flagship.
Another 12 won't even respond
to our hails.
That's not illegal.
Jump drive upgrades
is a military decision.
And you alone get to make
that determination?
Yes, Mr. Gaeta.
Do you have a problem with that?
Tylium ship's pulling out of formation.
They're spinning up their FTL drives.
Hitei Kan has jumped away.
Taking all our fuel with them.
You think I know
where the tylium ship is?
I know that you do.
<i>Hitei Kan, this is Athena.</i>
<i>Stand by to be boarded.</i>
The world is frakked.
It's upside down and somebody's
gotta turn it right side up.
- Are you that man?
- I'm one of them.
- I need a partner.
- You've got one.
Every revolution begins
with one small act.
Somebody close that hatch.
Let's talk.
It's fresh. You want a cup?
Ever since they started grinding it
out of algae I've lost the taste.
We got three more
civilian captains pitching fits,
refusing to allow
the Cylon engineers on board.
I thought we settled that
2 days ago.
Well, the tylium ship
didn't get the message.
They're screamin' bloody murder
to anyone who'll listen,
claiming they're being
illegally seized by our marines.
I'm tired of this.
Go to Lee.
Tell the Quorum that if they don't
get their ships in line,
they can all share a blanket
in Zarek's cell.
- I'll make the call, but...
- Smells good.
Hello, Colonel.
- Madam President.
- How's it going?
You were saying, Saul?
It's just...
Given the fleet's mood
toward Cylons...
You might not want me
taking point on this.
I'll be up there in a minute.
Mr. Vice President.
Rumors are already starting to spread.
Good luck keeping the lid on.
The fleet's the least of my worries.
You're clear, sir.
Connor called in. We're good to go
with the small arms locker.
- C deck?
- Narcho and Paley. They're all over it.
Move out, Corporal.
Our biggest problem
is still the Quorum.
You can isolate them
for a few hours, but...
They'll huff and puff,
but reality will trump
their sense of duty soon enough,
with one exception.
- We've been through this.
- He's a wild card.
Talkin' about the Admiral's son.
Well, push his buttons.
I hear you're good at that.
The Colonel's right, you know.
The fleet has never been comfortable
with this blanket Cylon amnesty.
This coffee is terrible.
Siccing Lee on the Quorum is only
gonna be seen as a shot across the bow.
He can hedge it all he wants,
but the delegates will see it comes
- straight from you.
- Well, Lee can handle it.
Yes, he can, and so can you.
And I'm not getting involved.
So he can take care of himself
and you can take care of yourself...
And I am not getting pulled back in.
Yeah.
The legendary Adama silence.
I can see right through it.
This passive-aggressive pretense
that you are okay
if I don't get involved.
I don't do passive-aggressive.
Yes, you do.
You just don't know that's what it is.
Well...
Get some rest.
- Rest ?
- I'll try to make it home for supper.
I'll have it ready.
Cantrell's the key. Tell Lee.
If he can get to Cantr...
I'm not.
Son of a bitch!
I got a fuel leak over here!
Frakkin' spark will blow
the whole place.
You guys. I need all of you
to clear the deck now.
Now!
Sitrep, Lieutenant.
Raptor's transponder's down
for the count, and LSO's good to go.
What the hell?
What are you doing?
This ship's on hold
for an emergency medical transport,
not some bogus, VIP shuttle.
Sorry,, I assumed the LSO called it in.
This bird's been cleared for launch.
No, I didn't get the order.
New mission takes priority.
The admiral believes that Zarek
may have an attempt on his life
here on Galactica.
Given the Vice President's
controversial status,
he's being transferred
to Colonial One.
All right.
Soon as I confirm it with CIC.
You have confirmation.
Laird...
The Admiral
doesn't want this leaking out.
I'm sorry
I can't take your word for it.
Well, good riddance.
Frakker's been up Adama's ass
since he transferred in
from Pegasus.
- He won't be the last.
- Get on that ship.
- Not yet.
- I need you...
I know what you need.
I also know a little
about revolution, Mr. Gaeta.
Success doesn't hinge
on some grand operatic ideal
or the will of the people.
It hangs in the cumulative moments,
each one building on the next,
and it could be lost
with the slightest hesitation.
I started this,
and I'll see it through.
Now get on that frakkin' ship.
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA
Season 4 - Episode 12


Subtitles
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-
Colonel Tigh, sitrep.
Cap is out.
Dradis shows no enemy contacts.
Fleet's still jacked up
on Zarek's anti-Cylon bull.
Lee's giving the Quorum a shove,
but it'd take a cavity search
to find the backbone
in that sorry bunch.
I'm showing a launch, but we don't
have anything listed in the flight log.
Laird probably rescheduled
and it didn't make it into the system.
See if you can find the update.
I've got Nowart rounding up every marine
that can still pull a trigger.
So if you get fed up playing chicken
with these bastards, say the word.
Hitei Kan was a special case.
We have to shoot up
every ship we go into,
you can kiss this alliance goodbye.
Nothing. I better call down
to the deck just to make sure.
Yeah, hold up.
Is that your launch?
Because I'm not seeing
a squawk code.
Is there a problem?
We've got an unidentified contact
off the flight deck.
No transponder ID.
I'm thinking dradis ghost.
Last thing I need.
Four years without a pit stop.
Equipment's sketchy as hell.
Mr. Gaeta,
order a full diagnostic on dradis.
Yes, sir, right away.
Order, order!
I remind you once again
that Mr. Zarek
was taken into custody
because he was agitating
against a lawful order.
Now, these Cylon FTL drives
are essential
if the fleet is going to move on.
Mr. Vice President.
Don't look so surprised, Lee.
Even your father knows
when he's holding a losing hand.
I'll take it.
Yeah, I used to be pretty good
at this game.
Oh, yeah?
Makin' the shot.
Winnin' the big game.
Can't believe
that used to matter to me.
That life back in the Colonies...
It's like a dream to me now.
And the further away we get...
Gods, I remember you
and me back at Joe's bar,
slammin' drinks, shootin' pyramid.
Those were good times.
They were, weren't they?
I really... I really thought there was
somethin' between us, you know?
And when that didn't happen,
I wondered, "Was it me?"
- No, Diana, I was...
- You know, now I'm thinkin' no.
Maybe it was somethin' else.
Some Cylon thing.
Your programming.
Gods, I know it's been months,
but I just can't let it go.
Cool it! Save it!
We got him.
Save it.
Private Jaffe.
Log this.
Yes, sir.
I'm getting a fire warning on deck C
near the main antenna array.
Order the damage
control team to C deck.
Have them report back to me
with their assessment ASAP.
Yes, sir.
Admiral, if the wireless array
goes down,
we could lose communications
across the fleet.
Given our current situation,
I'm thinking this fire
might not be an accident.
Zarek's true believers
would have a field day
if we went dark.
Very well.
Have the marine fire unit
accompany the DC party
and prepare an evacuation
of all personnel from C deck.
Yes, sir.
Look at you, the proud papa.
When I named you Hotdog,
I sure as hell got that right.
- Knock it off.
- Come on, don't be shy.
There had to have been other conquests
for the great Brendan Constanza.
And you frakked half the fleet.
What do you have to show for it?
<i>Attention... Fire in compartment C.</i>
<i>Evacuate sections 29 through 42.</i>
Narcho.
You heard the alarm, Captain.
Evac the area. I'm in charge here.
Since when did they put pilots
in charge of damage control?
- Hey, I'm talkin'...
- Take your frakkin' hands off me.
Gods.
Nobody even knows
what you are anymore.
Son of a bitch.
Grab as much as you can carry
and get up to the hangar deck.
You, take those four people
on D deck.
Anybody asks any questions,
you tell 'em it's routine,
Admiral's orders.
<i>Gaeta, CIC.</i>
This is Starbuck,
get me the Admiral now.
He's busy, Captain.
Gods damn it, we've got civilians
arming themselves down here!
<i>Gaeta, CIC.</i>
This is Lee Adama.
Get my father on the line.
I'm sorry, Lee, we're having
a bit of an emergency right now.
<i>Is it serious?</i>
Nothing damage control can't handle,
but you know the Admiral.
Yeah, well, I thought I did.
Well, maybe you can help.
Do you have any idea
why Tom Zarek was released?
Released, when?
<i>That's just perfect.</i>
<i>He tells me to threaten
the delegates,</i>
then he blindsides me
by giving Zarek a pass.
<i>Doesn't make sense to me either.</i>
As soon as your father gets back,
I'll be sure that he knows you called.
Problems on the home front?
I have to say, Lee, you don't seem
particularly happy to see me.
I'm glad you're out.
My father overreached
when he had you arrested.
But I hope you changed your mind
about the Cylon FTLs.
We need those drives.
At least the Admiral thinks we do.
Problem with you is
that you're tryin' to have it both ways.
Honor thy father
or be true to your oath
as the Caprican representative.
At some point the two don't mix.
Do you know why he released me?
Because I'm only a threat
if he recognizes a civilian authority.
Afraid our experiment in democracy
is about to end.
Adama entertained it until now
because of Roslin.
But since she abdicated
the throne...
He wouldn't do that.
Really?
Because he did it before.
Tell me, what excuse
did he give this time
when he refused to take your call?
- You're leaving.
- For Galactica, to prove you wrong.
Sir, we just lost
communications ship-wide.
- Switch to secondaries.
- They're a no-go.
Backups are down as well.
And the fire seems to be escalating.
I'm seeing cascading system
failures across the board.
Main antenna and backup
both down at the same time?
With comms down,
the damage control team
has no way of relaying
the status of the fire.
<i>Galactica, come in,
Galactica, come in.</i>
<i>Galactica, do you read?</i>
So you're tryin' to tell me
that all communications are still out?
What the hell's being done...
Whatever this is about,
you're making a big mistake.
Oh, sure, we're confused.
Maybe we should have a trial,
sort it all out.
After four years of fighting
with those Cylon things,
did you really think you could
make a deal with them?
So where are
your precious Cylons now?
Take it from someone who died once,
it's no fun.
- Let him go.
- Frak you.
I could do this all day.
Who's next? Racetrack?
Connor?
Let him go.
All right, we need
to get the hell outta here.
Kara, now.
Follow me.
- Please.
- Ah, Gods!
Hang on, Buddy.
Hang on, you're gonna be all right.
I know, it tastes kinda yucky.
I'll get more sugar next time
in the galley, okay?
Okay.
Sharon, you better get her
finished up and down to day care.
- I don't know, just grab Hera...
- In here!
Go ahead, Captain, grab for it!
Okay, easy, easy.
You want me, fine,
just leave them out of it.
Get her outta here, move!
Remember me, big man?
From Pegasus?
You and that toaster Tyrol
wasted my friend Thorne.
We didn't want that to happen.
You had a choice but you backed
the skin-job over your own kind.
And to prove how messed up it was,
instead of showin' you the airlock,
your Cylon-loving Admiral
promoted you to CAG.
- Frak you.
- Sorry.
I'm savin' myself
for your sweet, toaster wife.
Skulls, Racetrack?
Gods, I flew with them.
Semper frakkin' fi.
Damn it. Way Connor was talkin', they
got people ready to move on every deck.
The hangar deck's just a beachhead.
They want the ship.
- Zarek played me just right.
- Must've made some new friends.
Yeah, with a hell of a lot of firepower.
Vipers, Raptors, gun batteries.
You know, we can't do this alone.
Right now, all we can count on
is you and me.
Take a breath, Lee.
Feels good bein' alive, doesn't it?
What was that?
Feelin' right
for the first time in weeks.
Okay, Kara, my dad. Where is he?
He was in CIC
when communications crapped out.
CIC's protected. He won't give up
without a fight. The President?
Don't know.
- All right, come with me.
- Go.
What do they have down there,
a forest fire?
Where the frak are
my damage reports?
Admiral,
sensors are still showing red,
but these trace gas readings
don't make any sense.
They're normal.
If something was burnin' down there,
the carbon monoxide levels
would be spikin' through the roof.
If the fire's compromised our sensors,
it's possible our readings are suspect.
With communications out,
we have no way of verifying anything.
All I know is
I'm tired of being blind.
Private Jaffe.
Double-time it down to C deck.
Check in with the damage control team,
get their reports, and haul ass back.
Yes, sir.
Drop him.
See you real soon.
Carl.
They're going to kill us.
Sam?
Can you give me something
to stop the bleeding?
All right.
Don't you see?
Our children represent everything
that the humans hate.
With resurrection gone, the thought
that the Cylon race could survive
through natural procreation
terrifies them.
Enough.
You're scaring her.
Right now, they need us alive...
To use as bargaining chips
against the rebel Cylons.
Especially you.
Look, if you're expecting
some grand wisdom,
you can forget it.
I don't have any more answers
than you do.
You might wanna keep that
to yourself.
No, they're coming down.
We're headed toward 'em right now.
We can't hold 'em off.
Come on, hurry!
Out here! We need more ammo!
Admiral, I checked the array.
The equipment's been jury-rigged...
Sergeant of the guards, get your marines
in here! Nobody gets in or out!
What the hell are you doing?
What is this?
Admiral!
Hold your fire!
Cease fire!
Hold your fire!
Nobody fires without my order!
Admiral!
Get your staff to stand down.
- You son of a bitch!
- Stand down, Colonel!
Everyone!
Stand down!
- You killed this boy.
- Admiral Adama,
I am removing you
from command of this ship.
I am taking you into custody
on the charge of treason.
You swore an oath
when you put that uniform on.
You pledged to defend
this ship and her crew.
You swore the same allegiance.
What happened to your oath?
For seven years, I have done
my frakking job and for what?
To take orders from a Cylon?
To let machines network our ship?
No, you... You are not the leader
that you were when we started.
You're just a sad, old man
that has let his heart and his affection
for a Cylon cloud his judgment.
I want you all to understand this!
If you do this...
there will be no forgiveness.
No amnesty.
This boy...
died honoring his uniform.
You...
You'll die with nothing.
Sergeant of the guards, take the senior
staff, put them in a holding cell,
place Admiral Adama
and Colonel Tigh under arrest.
Do it!
- Sir...
- Don't touch me!
Please, sir.
Take him.
This isn't right.
Where are the guards?
- Madam President, you all right?
- I'm fine.
Get inside.
There's been an uprising.
I'm not sure how many of the crew
are involved.
It is widespread.
Your father must know about this.
Can't the marines stop it?
There should've been marines
outside that hatchway.
Madam President,
we are in danger of losing this ship.
Oh, my Gods. Bill...
Yeah, I don't know. Without comm,
we can't get through to CIC.
But it is bigger than Galactica.
Zarek's already back on Colonial One.
He wants the presidency.
Of course.
Frakking Zarek.
He always had dangerous ideas.
It's not too late to stop this.
Address the fleet, call for calm.
- The people will listen to you.
- I'll do whatever it takes.
And I will not allow Tom Zarek
to assume the presidency
under any circumstances.
I have an idea about the wireless.
Sir, intercom's up.
I'm getting multiple reports of gunfire
near the engine room.
Order Redwing to move in with marines.
I want that area secured.
Specialist Gage...
Stay with us.
Stack a heavy pile right here.
Stop them from gettin' in that door.
Come on, people, faster's better.
They could show up at anytime.
You understand
I have no desire to leave you.
No desire at all.
But I have to go.
If they're coming for anyone,
they're coming for me.
- And you'll all be safer.
- No, it's our fault, Gaius,
because we can't protect you
and I am so sorry for that.
Your transport will be here soon.
I want you to take this.
And I want you to know
that we will pray for you
and for your safe return, okay?
I'm deeply...
Right.
Okay, okay.
Mr. Tyrol?
You are absolutely certain
that it's imperative I leave?
Look, I only know what Jeanne saw.
The hangar deck's gone.
CIC and weapons are next.
And then nobody's safe here.
Hang on.
Right, right. So we should be
getting out of here soon...
- Go.
- And getting hold of some weapons, no?
Because...
Jeanne, I don't want the statue.
You can keep the statue.
You keep the statue.
Clear.
- Madam President, wait...
- It's all right. They know who I am.
I need to speak to Dr. Baltar.
No, you're not welcome in here.
I got this. Go ahead.
- Go on.
- I need to see Baltar.
There's somethin' you need to know.
I got people all over the ship
givin' me information.
The Admiral
was just led away from the CIC.
- Where to?
- No idea. My guess would be the brig.
Don't trust the ship's comm systems.
We're using these.
The hangar deck's lost to us.
If you get your father to the secondary
storage bay within the hour,
- I'll get him off the ship.
- I'll handle the fleet, go.
Galen...
Why?
Old man deserves a better fate
than what he'll get from them.
Go find your father, Lee.
It's Nowart, isn't it?
- That's right, sir.
- I thought I remembered you. Marine.
You put it on the line
when we took New Caprica.
Got pretty hairy down there, sir.
Screw the war stories.
I remember you too, Maldonado.
Big mouth, not much of a soldier.
It doesn't matter.
Because when this is over,
there's gonna be a reckoning.
And live or die, it's how you act today
that's gonna matter.
So what's it gonna be, Nowart?
Admiral, don't do this.
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let
a guy like you run me off my own ship.
You wanna shoot? Go on.
Let's see if you got a pair.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Put your hands behind your back.
You all right, Saul?
I'll live. What about him?
I think...
we'll take him with us. Go.
<i>But obviously
I have to get back as quickly...</i>
Going somewhere?
Yes, matter of fact, I am.
They consider it
to be a precautionary measure.
Sensible...
Given the delicate nature of the fleet.
Very sensible, considering the fleet's
tearing itself to pieces right now.
Have you come to pray?
No, I have something
more tangible in mind.
There is a chance
that we can avoid more bloodshed
if I address the fleet
and reassure them
the Cylons mean no harm.
Your faith in your oratorical skills
is impressive.
And I'd love to help,
but unfortunately, communication
down here, just as dodgy as...
I know you have a wireless.
You've been using it to communicate
with you flock all these months.
It's a trick, Gaius.
I wish it were.
She's afraid of your teachings.
She will take the wireless...
All right, okay, Paulla...
Thank you.
She's got a point, hasn't she?
I mean, if you can convince the fleet,
why can't you convince her?
The thing is that I never
really believed in your conversion,
so I was counting on your well-honed
sense of self-preservation.
I'm so sick of your insinuations.
I recall your sudden allegiance
to the priestess Elosha
and the scrolls of Pythia
the last time
your political fortunes were in doubt.
Tell me,
how is that working out for you now?
If it makes you happy,
maybe we're both frauds
and this is our last chance to atone.
Civilians are trying
to barricade the aft supply hold.
I'm on it.
Gaeta wants us to back up Redwing
in the engine room.
They got four civvies down,
but there's still some holdouts,
so we're gonna need
some more firepower.
Where were you taking us?
The brig.
Gaeta wants all essential personnel
and Cylons held...
Might see some friendly faces there.
Get up.
Sir, ships' captains
are calling.
They wanna know why Galactica's
not responding to their hails.
Put 'em up on speaker.
All of it.
And then get me
a scrambled line to Tom Zarek.
- <i>We're unable to reach Galactica.</i>
- <i>Admiral Adama, do you read?</i>
- <i>Are they going to jump away?</i>
- <i>Who's in charge of Galactica?</i>
- <i>Can't trust Admiral Adama.</i>
- <i>Any vessel in communication with Co...</i>
I have Colonial One.
Mr. Zarek,
<i>I've taken command of Galactica.</i>
<i>The Admiral and his staff
are in custody.</i>
- Adama's still alive?
- <i>You sound disappointed.</i>
It's a loose end.
I'm sure you have your reasons.
<i>Still, congratulations are in order.</i>
<i>With the future of the fleet at stake
you've done a very courageous thing.</i>
We can fine-tune
our rationalizations later.
I'm still bringing
communications back online.
- <i>And the fleet's in an uproar.</i>
- Don't worry. They'll fall in line.
- <i>Especially after I shower them...</i>
- <i>Women and men of the fleet,</i>
- <i>this is your President.</i>
- What the frak?
<i>We have come to a crossroads
in our long and painful journey.</i>
Tom, are you hearing this?
Turn on your wireless.
Of all the decisions that I have...
Where's this coming from?
... the presidency,
none was more frightening
or more difficult
than agreeing
to this alliance with the Cylons.
But we have come to a crossroads
in our long and painful journey.
Cylons and humans
have been at war for generations.
We know nothing else.
And we have been locked
in a struggle
that has seen both sides suffer
unspeakable loss.
With our supplies running low
<i>and our options limited,</i>
<i>our former enemies
may represent our last,</i>
<i>perhaps our only hope.</i>
To those in the fleet...
Find that frequency, Gage.
<i>... who would reject this alliance,
I am asking you...</i>
Isolate the signal!
- I don't know how to.
- Gods damn it.
<i>No, I am begging you to reconsider</i>
<i>and place your trust back in those</i>
who have brought you this far,
and to reject those traitors
who would use
your fear of the Cylons
<i>to destroy colonial civilization...</i>
<i>- President Roslin, do you read?
- Galactica, do you read?</i>
Sir.
It's the Vice President.
I couldn't get near the brig.
Even if he is in there...
- What's goin' on?
- Let's go.
It's all right, Lee.
We're all right.
Thank Gods.
What the hell is this?
- Easy. He's our prisoner.
- Starbuck.
- Lower your weapon.
- They've taken over the ship.
If you want it back,
this is the only way.
We don't have time
to take prisoners.
Get outta my face.
Move!
They are not your men anymore.
They are the enemy.
10 H 21 - SECONDARY STORAGE BAY
Who would've thought?
You probably knew him
better than anyone back on New Caprica.
Well, obviously his loyalties
were divided even back then.
We both made rather bad choices
when it comes
to our presidential aides-de-camp
wouldn't you say?
10 H 23 - WASTE WATER STORAGE
How many men do you think Gaeta has?
- Enough.
- Hold up here.
Middle of this mess,
you really think
Tyrol's found a way off the ship?
You tell me. He's one of yours.
- You got a problem?
- Yeah, I got a problem.
Your people annihilated
the human race.
No, let the great statesman talk.
You wanna know why Tom Zarek's
got so much clout in this fleet?
When you get past the arrogance,
he's right.
We can pretend to put it behind us,
exchange lofty words about an alliance,
- but if survival has come to that.
- It's all we've got. Now, calm down.
It's all they left us.
Secondary storage airlock this way.
Let's go.
CIC.
What?
It's Baltar.
- What do you want, Gaius?
- What do I want?
I want this to stop...
now.
Right now.
This is madness.
<i>This doesn't become, you know.
Treason.</i>
<i>Or whatever they're gonna call it
when this thing is through. I know you,</i>
Felix.
I know you're a good man.
You're an honorable man.
You wanna do the right thing.
<i>Even your failings have been
understandable.</i>
What, like serving
in your corrupt administration?
<i>You know exactly
what I'm talking about.</i>
Our little secret.
Sealed with a very special pen.
<i>But I forgive you for that, Felix.</i>
<i>I'm telling you...</i>
<i>If you are hungry for redemption,
this is not the way.</i>
- Goodbye, Gaius.
<i>- Felix, please, listen to...</i>
What's Raptor 6-1-9's mission?
Transporting human crew
from the Cylon baseship.
They should have
called the LSO by now.
They're not headed
for the hangar deck.
We're ready.
It's good to see you, Mr. Tyrol.
Forgot this place was down here.
Everybody did.
Got trashed during New Caprica,
but I brought it back online for this.
I came here because
I don't want you to worry about me.
And I know what you have to do.
<i>This is section 12, copy.</i>
Go.
<i>Marine fire team just went past.
Looks like they're comin' your way.</i>
You got 2 minutes.
Take them back the way we came.
You go with them, Colonel.
Come too far
to walk out on you now, Bill.
- What are you doing, sir?
- Colonel and I are gonna make sure
that the President's Raptor
gets outta here safely.
<i>Initiating launch sequence.</i>
Open it.
Admiral, Madam President, please.
Let's move it.
Get it open.
Prepare to launch.
Raptor just took off
from an aft airlock.
They're not responding.
- Gage, who's on CAP?
- I got Hotdog, Narcho...
Get me Narcho on a wireless.
Scramble frequency.
What are your orders?
Arm all weapons.
Engage the target
and destroy.
You coulda gone over with her.
I couldn't have lived with it.
Come on! Let's go!
It's been an honor
to have served with you,
my friend.
All right, soldier, give it to me.
Cover up.
Fire in the hole!
<i>Précédemment dans</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
Le monde marche sur la tête.
Quelqu'un doit arranger ça.
Êtes-vous cet homme ?
En partie.
- CIC, Gaeta.
- Il y a des civils qui s'arment ici !
Sergent, faites venir vos marines,
bouclez les issues !
À quoi vous jouez, putain ?
Amiral Adama,
je vous retire le commandement.
Ne faites pas ça.
C'est pas demain la veille qu'un type
comme toi m'expulsera de mon vaisseau.
Le colonel et moi allons couvrir
le départ de la présidente.
- Non, papa, tu peux pas rester là...
- Je compte sur toi.
Ne laisse pas ces animaux
déshonorer ce vaisseau.
À bientôt.
Le Raptor s'est séparé
d'un sas de poupe.
Activez les armes, engagez la cible
et détruisez-la.

<i>Je décroche vers la zone 5.</i>
Red Viper 2, ici Narcho,
la cible est sous ton nez. Engage.
Narcho, ici Hot Dog. Vu, je l'ai.
<i>Raptor colonial, ici Red Viper 2.
Identifiez-vous immédiatement.</i>
- <i>Identifiez-vous.</i>
- Hot Dog, t'es bouché ?
<i>Engage et détruis !</i>
Narcho, ici Hot Dog, cible à portée.
Attends identification.
<i>Putain, Hot Dog...
Galactica, ici Narcho, j'y vais.</i>
Cap 9-3-4. Pas d'ouverture.
Hot Dog, ici Narcho,
<i>détruis la cible ou décroche.</i>
<i>Je répète,
détruis la cible ou décroche.</i>
Où est le...
Ici la présidente
<i>à bord du Raptor, ne tirez pas.</i>
Brouillez-la.
<i>... échapper aux insurgés
qui se sont emparés du Galactica...</i>
C'est fait.
Ils nous lâchent pas.
Accrochez-vous.
- Hot Dog, statut de la cible.
- <i>Je sais pas.</i>
La présidente
est à bord de la cible.
On a Adama et Tigh.
<i>- Ils étaient dans le sas auxiliaire.</i>
- Enfermez-les avec les Cylons.
Oubliez ça. Mettez Tigh avec les Cylons.
Amenez-moi Adama.
Compris.
Kareem, passez-moi Red 2.
Lieutenant Costanza,
ici le Galactica,
<i>on vous a donné un ordre,
exécutez-le.</i>
Arrête de cogiter et tire, putain.
Galactica, ici Narcho,
<i>cible en vue.
Alignement en cours.</i>
- Putain, Narcho !
- <i>J'y suis.</i>
Ils nous ont verrouillés.
Cible manquée.
Le Raptor a abordé le vaisseau-mère.
Pourquoi cette attaque ?
- On est la cible de Vipers.
- C'était nous la cible, pas vous.
- Qu'avez-vous fait ?
- Leur gouvernement a perdu le contrôle.
- C'est faux.
- Pardon, comment vous appelez ça ?
Adama est un fugitif.
Gaeta a une armée,
et Zarek contrôle le Colonial One.
- Adama est libre.
- La dernière fois qu'on l'a vu,
il était acculé dans un sas
avec Tigh.
Si vous avez fui, Gaeta et Zarek
devaient avoir de sérieux appuis.
Au contraire ! On a pu arriver ici,
car un pilote a refusé de nous abattre.
Mais l'autre pilote n'avait
aucun scrupule à abattre la présidente.
- S'ils sont prêts à ça...
- On est en danger. On doit sauter.
- Je suis d'accord.
- Et les Quatre ?
Tyrol, Anders et Tigh sont là-bas.
Vous y pensez ?
Sautez et vous ne les reverrez plus.
En restant, vous laissez à Adama
une chance de les sauver.
Placez votre vaisseau
au coeur de la flotte.
Utilisez la flotte pour vous couvrir.
Donnez-lui du temps.
- Et si...
- Gaeta ne risquera pas la flotte.
Il n'a pas les couilles. Allez-y !
Bienvenue.
Je savais
que vous n'étiez pas sur ce Raptor.
Ce vaisseau est trop important
pour que je le laisse
aux mains de traîtres.
C'est ça.
Dommage que vous méprisiez
ses occupants.
Vous êtes loin du compte.
Prouvez-le-moi.
Vous voulez sauver des vies ?
Appelez Roslin.
Dites-lui de revenir et de se rendre.
Je ne répéterai pas, amiral.
Amiral.
C'est vous l'amiral maintenant
À vous d'appeler Roslin.
Faites-la rire.
Aux postes de combat.
Passez en condition un.
Armez les batteries,
le cap de la cible...
Le vaisseau-mère.
Ils se mêlent à la flotte.
Ils se cachent.
Repos.
Marine, demandez à l'escadron bleu
de le mettre en quarantaine.
Faites chauffer le FTL.
Dites aux capitaines de faire de même.
Kelly, préparez
l'arrivée de M. Zarek.
Maintenant, vous allez m'abattre,
M. Gaeta.

"Doit-on sauver les enfants ?"
Alors, l'avocat dit "On s'en tape."
Et le prêtre dit :
"Avons-nous le temps ?"
Fait chier.
Ici la présidente Laura Roslin.
Ici la présidente...
Bon sang.
Bobo.
C'est rien, il va guérir.
Je me demande ce que va faire Gaeta.
Dans ton cas,
couper une de tes putains de jambes.
Le vaisseau-mère est encerclé.
Ce n'était pas la peine
d'amener tout le Quorum.
- Si vous insistez pour le procès...
- J'insiste.
Alors, je veux pouvoir
les surveiller.
Je sais, vous voulez faire
ce qui est juste.
Il me semblait que vous aussi.
C'est le cas.
Mais il faut aller de l'avant.
Impossible, tant qu'ils n'auront pas
répondu de leurs actes.
À commencer par Adama.
Un monde à la fois, Tom.
11 H 31 - PONT D COULOIR 2
J'imagine que personne
ne va nourrir mon chien.
L'amiral est accusé de trahison,
de désertion,
d'assistance à l'ennemi,
et de graves manquements à ses devoirs.
Ces crimes sont passibles
du peloton d'exécution.
Je ne suis pas très bon tireur.
L'amiral a le droit
à une cour martiale.
Nous avons besoin d'un avocat
pour assurer sa défense.
Il leur faut un maquereau.
Le commandant Gaeta
représentera le peuple.
Le commandant Gaeta...
Pourquoi vous faites ça ?
Pour la justice.
La justice...
Donc, j'imagine
que si je choisis...
d'esquiver cette petite excursion
pour la justice,
les deux jumeaux là-bas
s'entraîneront au tir sur moi ?
Faites votre travail.
Très bien.
Faites venir les juges.
Je serai le juge.
Je vois. Nous sommes donc
à court de capitaines.
Ils sont trop occupés
à protéger leurs vaisseaux
du vaisseau cylon
qu'Adama a invité dans leur flotte.
Fourrez-le vous dans le cul.
J'ai pas besoin d'avocat.
Vous êtes accusé de trahison,
- Par qui ?
- désertion et assistance...
- C'est une blague.
- ... vous répondrez de ces crimes.
C'est ça. Je leur ai donné le bain,
et à manger.
- J'adore l'ennemi.
- Pourrais-je avoir
quelques minutes avec M. Adama ?
Pour lui faire comprendre
la gravité de ces accusations.
Vous voulez qu'il comprenne.
Soyez bref.
Ici la présidente.
Ici Laura Ros... Allô ?
Nous n'avons même plus de protection.
La flotte s'est éparpillée.
Et les Vipers de patrouille
s'enhardissent.
Certains testent leurs armes.
Ils tirent dans le vide,
comme pour nous inviter à réagir.
Nous devrions discuter.
"Le monde marche sur la tête.
"Et quelqu'un doit arranger ça."
Voilà les mots de Felix Gaeta.
Il pense en être capable.
Je l'en crois capable.
Mais ce sont
de lourdes responsabilités.
Vous êtes là pour qu'il rencontre
des gens qui refusent d'abandonner,
des gens qui ont le courage
d'exprimer leur désaccord.
Mais qui, au bout du compte,
restent fidèles à la présidence.
Vous devriez partir.
M. le vice-président.
Ainsi soit-il.
Tuez-les.
Allez chercher M. Gaeta.
- Je n'ai pas voulu ça !
- Bien sûr que si.
- C'est un meurtre !
- Un coup d'État.
Que vous avez amorcé.
Pour prendre le commandement
et détruire nos ennemis
avant qu'ils le fassent.
Qu'est-ce que vous avez fait ?
C'est ce qui arrive.
C'est un mensonge.
Tout ça est basé sur des mensonges.
Vous ne comprenez pas ?
La vérité était de notre côté.
Maintenant...
La vérité est dictée
par les vainqueurs.
Adama doit disparaître.
On ne peut plus reculer.
12 H 48 - VAISSEAU-MÈRE REBELLE
Désolée.
Le choix a été difficile,
mais notre décision est prise.
Nous partons.
Nous avons une chance de survivre.
Désolée, je pensais
qu'en tant qu'une des Cinq,
vous auriez une vision
plus large que ça.
Si ce n'est pas déjà fait,
Gaeta va éjecter Tigh,
Tyrol, Anders,
puis passer aux autres.
Kara, Helo, Adama...
Non. Stop.
Son sort est quasiment scellé,
soyez-en sûre.
- S'il vous plaît.
- Le nôtre, pas encore.
Personne ne croyait qu'on survivrait
à l'holocauste nucléaire,
ni à l'enfer sur New Caprica,
ni aux 50 000 autres crises
qu'on a traversées.
Mais on l'a fait, on est là.
C'est devenu une habitude
de défier la chance,
surtout pour William Adama.
Et il est en vie.
Il est en vie et il reprendra
le commandement de la flotte,
à nouveau.
Et quand ce jour viendra,
il saura...
qui l'a suivi et qui a fui.
Qui voulez-vous être ?
Qui voulez-vous être ?
Tu cherches une arme ?
Ils t'ont relâché ?
13 H 05 - ARMURERIE
- Vive la révolution.
- Sors.
Tire-moi dessus.
Je suis trop crevé pour sortir.
T'es une machine. Sors.
C'est vrai, je suis une machine.
Et toi ?
Crétin.
C'était un putain de vaisseau avant.
Vraiment, oui.
J'ai appris que ta gamine
est pas cylon.
J'aurais pu te dire
qu'elle poserait problème.
Merci.
Ça aurait pas compté.
Va-t'en, et loin.
Va-t'en, synthétique !
Frak !
Laissez tomber.
Vous croyez
que si vous me persuadez de coopérer,
vous aurez une tape dans le dos
au lieu d'une balle.
Laissez pas votre orgueil s'interposer.
Gardez une trace de votre innocence.
- Votre déposition...
- Je déposerai pas.
Gaeta et Zarek vont échouer.
Vous le pensez vraiment ?
Qu'en dites-vous ?
Je trahirai pas mes convictions
dans une déposition.
Des gens se mobilisent,
je les ai vus.
Donnez-leur une chance,
gagnez du temps, faites l'idiot...
On est prêts depuis quelque temps.
Tu es blessé ?
Je crois que le mot juste
est "endommagé".
Y a pas moyen.
Ça marchera jamais.
De près, je peux en avoir deux
avant que tu tires.
D'ici, avec une arme de poing ?
On a une seule chance de réussir.
Et je vais la saisir.
Grenade !
J'ai pas dégoupillé.
- Pas drôle.
- Parce que c'est pas ton idée.
Non.
T'es pas drôle.
Tigh.
- C'est Kara.
- C'est Lee et Kara.
Attendez... Il est où ?
- Ces bâtards se sont lâchés sur Helo.
- Où est mon père ?
- Kelly l'a pris.
- Quoi ? Vous étiez ensemble.
- Comment ça se fait ?
- J'en sais rien.
Allez, bordel.
Sortons avant qu'ils nous trouvent.
Je prends Hera.
Ça va ?
À gauche.
- Kara, laisse tomber, on file.
- On vous rejoint.
Regarde-moi.
Tu m'entends ?
On peut pas rester là.
Fais attention à son cou.
Faut y aller !
Faut qu'on bouge Sam.
Prends Hera et va chez Baltar.
Personne n'approche ces dingues.
Vous y serez en sécurité.
- Il perd son sang.
- Bouge pas sa tête.
- Allez !
- Je suis une grande fille.
Il faut aider Sam !
Lee, va chercher ton père.
Vas-y.
Vas-y !
Emmène-le voir Cottle.
- Athena, vas-y.
- On bouge !
Allez, on y va.
Vite !
Vous nous avez abandonnés à notre sort
sur New Caprica.
Je vous ai sauvé la peau.
Admettez que vous avez négligé
vos devoirs de militaire.
Vous avez porté assistance à l'ennemi
et vous alliez leur donner accès...
- Objection, il harcèle le témoin.
- ... à tous les vaisseaux.
Je l'ai fait.
Je leur ai donné l'accès.
Et vous savez quoi ?
Je ne leur ai pas porté assistance.
C'est eux qui l'ont fait.
<i>Tigh et les synthétiques se sont évadés.
On s'en occupe.</i>
Saul Tigh a été tué
en tentant de s'évader.
Je suis navré.
Mais vous avez bien
porté assistance à l'ennemi.
Saul Tigh était un Cylon.
Et quand vous l'avez découvert,
vous l'avez gardé comme XO, non ?
Je ne répondrai plus
à vos questions, M. Gaeta.
Le prisonnier est déclaré coupable.
Ce n'est pas un procès.
C'est une farce.
On a fini.
<i>Ici la présidente Laura Roslin,
depuis le vaisseau-mère cylon.</i>
<i>Felix Gaeta s'est emparé
du Galactica par la force.</i>
<i>Les Cylons ne faisaient que se défendre.
Ils ne vous feront aucun mal.</i>
- <i>Je répète, les Cylons ne vous...</i>
- Brouillez ce signal.
Pourquoi elle émet toujours ?
Où est Hoshi ?
Ramenez cette andouille au CIC.
<i>... éteignez vos FTL...</i>
Ça a fonctionné.
Ils n'ont pas pu le brouiller.
Je savais que ça ferait l'affaire.
Montre tes mains.
Aidez-moi à l'emmener
jusqu'à Cottle.
Rien qu'en venant,
on s'est fait canarder deux fois.
Dont une fois par ses propres hommes.
Désolé.
Il va mourir.
Je suis désolé.
Frak !
Dix vaisseaux ont éteint leur FTL
après la transmission de Roslin.
10 vaisseaux sur 35.
- La salope.
- Non, elle nous a rendu service.
On sait de quel côté ils sont.
Gage, donnez les coordonnées
aux vaisseaux dont le FTL est allumé.
- Dites-leur de sauter sur-le-champ.
- Bien.
Formez un peloton d'exécution.
Des hommes de confiance.
Sécurisez le tube principal
du hangar de pont.
Emmenez-y Adama et attendez-moi.
Je peux compter sur vous, Noel ?
Absolument, monsieur.
Vous m'espionnez, Tom ?
Finissons-en
et tournons la page, OK, Felix ?
Où est le Patron ?
- Où est le Patron ?
- Ils vont l'abattre.
Où ?
Le tube principal du hangar de pont.
Allez, venez, bon sang.
Je viens avec vous.
Peloton prêt.
En joue !
Feu !
Tu rêvais.
Je n'arrivais pas à te réveiller.
Mon Dieu, ils vont l'exécuter.
J'ai mal au coeur, je...
Non, c'est mal. C'est mal.
S'il te plaît, arrête.
Mais...
Je veux que tu te sentes mieux.
Alors, coupe-moi les jambes.
Je me suis enfui...
encore.
J'ai disparu juste à temps...
encore.
La peur change le comportement.
Je n'ai pas fui par peur.
Pas cette fois, en tout cas.
J'ai fui loin de ces gens.
Mon Dieu, ces gens...
J'ai des sortes d'adeptes,
sur le Galactica.
Un fan-club.
Publiquement, je les écoutais.
En privé,
je méprisais leurs esprits provinciaux.
Leur détermination infaillible
à m'aider à me sentir mieux.
Je dois y retourner.
Je dois y retourner,
ils sont sous ma responsabilité.
Je suis navré.
15 H 02 - HANGAR DE PONT
<i>Galactica,</i>
ici la présidente Laura Roslin.
Libérez tous vos prisonniers,
et rendez
le commandement de la flotte
<i>à l'amiral William Adama.</i>
<i>Rendez-vous.</i>
<i>Vous avez cinq minutes.</i>
Lieutenant Allison,
procédez à l'exécution.
À vos ordres.
- Papa.
- Merci, mon fils.
- Ils te disaient mort.
- J'ai cru y passer, Bill.
Je veux reprendre mon vaisseau.
Lieutenant.
Désolé, monsieur.
Je vous ai toujours respecté.
Mais je hais les Cylons.
Et je ne peux obéir à un chef
qui refuse de les combattre.
Colonel, baissez votre arme.
Attachez-le.
Mettez-moi sur haut-parleur.
Ici Tom Zarek,
président des 12 colonies.
C'est terminé, Laura.
<i>Saul Tigh a été tué en s'échappant.</i>
Bill Adama
a été reconnu coupable de ses crimes,
<i>et exécuté ce matin.</i>
<i>C'est terminé, Laura.</i>
Vous devez penser
à la flotte, désormais,
et vous rendre.
Non !
Ni maintenant
ni jamais.
<i>Vous m'entendez ?
J'utiliserai</i>
<i>tous les canons,</i>
toutes les bombes,
toutes les balles,
toutes les armes que j'ai,
mes mains nues s'il le faut,
pour vous détruire.
Je le jure !
Je vous aurai tous !
Maintenant, on a un président
et un chef militaire à la fois.
Comment vous lui auriez répondu,
si vous aviez été là ?
Le vaisseau-mère se prépare à tirer.
- Est-on prêts à sauter ?
- Oui.
Entrez les coordonnées
du rendez-vous.
Préparez-vous à sauter.
Il y a eu assez de morts.
Abandonnons-les.
Si vous êtes d'accord.
<i>Galactica,</i>
<i>ici la présidente Laura Roslin.</i>
<i>Rendez-vous.</i>
Putain de merde.
Paré à sauter.
Compte à rebours.
Saut dans dix,
<i>neuf,</i>
<i>huit,</i>
six,
cinq,
<i>quatre,</i>
<i>trois...</i>
Le FTL vient de s'arrêter.
Allez-y.
Envoyez quelqu'un
en salle des machines.
Allez, bougez-vous !
Gaeta, lancez vos Vipers.
Réveillez-vous. Vous foutez quoi ?
Lancez vos Vipers !
Gaeta, on doit se défendre,
vous comprenez ?
Gaeta, on doit se défendre !
"Un jour, bientôt,
ça va nous retomber dessus."
Les batteries acquièrent des cibles.
Prêts à tirer.
Gaeta,
qu'est-ce qui déconne chez vous ?
Réveillez-vous !
Ne tirez pas !
Donnez-moi une arme.
- Baissez vos armes.
- Jetez vos armes.
- Passez-moi la présidente.
- Tout de suite.
Mme la présidente,
ici l'amiral. Arrêtez.
<i>Je répète,
le Galactica est sous contrôle.</i>
Arrêtez.
Oh non !
Il y a longtemps, c'était...
l'architecture.
Il y a eu une année
où je dessinais des plans partout.
Table à manger,
carrelage, livres anciens...
Ça rendait mes parents dingues.
À quel âge ?
Je sais pas.
Huit ans, peut-être neuf.
Mais je dois vous dire...
J'avais vraiment des idées folles.
Des restaurants
en forme de nourriture.
Des buildings immenses, des escaliers,
je mettais des escaliers partout.
Prise de guerre.
Plus âgé,
c'est devenu...
la médecine...
l'ingénierie, la photo.
Mais je pense
que j'aurais été meilleur architecte.
Puis, j'ai découvert les sciences.
Et je...
Je me trouvais vraiment doué.
Avant de vous rencontrer.
- Felix...
- Non.
Et je vous en prie, pas la religion.
J'accepte la tournure des événements.
Vraiment, Gaius, je...
J'espère juste...
J'espère...
qu'on découvrira,
un jour,
qui je suis.
Je sais qui vous êtes, Felix.
Je sais qui vous êtes.
Présentez armes.
En joue.
Ça s'est arrêté.
Feu.
<i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
The world is frakked. It's upside down,
somebody's gotta turn it right side up.
Are you that man?
I'm one of them.
Combat, Gaeta.
We've got civilians
arming themselves down here.
Gaeta!
Sergeant of the guards, get your marines
in here. Nobody gets in or out.
What the hell are you doing?
Admiral Adama. I am removing you
from command of this ship.
Admiral, don't do this.
I'm damned if I'm going to let
a guy like you run me off my own ship.
We are going to make sure
that the President's Raptor
gets out of here safely.
- No, dad, you can't stay here...
- I'm depending on you.
Make sure these animals
don't dishonor this ship.
I'll see you soon.
Raptor just took off
from an aft airlock.
Arm all weapons.
Engage the target.
And destroy.
<i>Narcho, Galactica,
hostile Raptor outbound.</i>
<i>Bearing 6-3-4 at 2.</i>
Order your flight to engage the target
and destroy.
<i>Roger, Galactica.</i>
Well, well, well...
it's the brig rat.
Admiral.
<i>Galactica, Narcho,
blind out of the sixth gate.</i>
<i>Breaking, go in zone five to pursue.</i>
Red Viper Two, Narcho,
the target's in your front yard. Engage.
Narcho, Hot Dog, tally, I got her.
<i>Colonial Raptor, Red Viper Two.
Identify yourself immediately.</i>
- <i>Repeat, identify.</i>
- Dig the crap out of your ears.
<i>Engage and destroy!</i>
Narcho, Hot Dog, target in range.
- Waiting for Raptor I.D.
- <i>Damn it, Hot Dog...</i>
<i>Galactica, Narcho, coming around.</i>
Bearing 9-3-4. Still no joy.
Hot Dog, Narcho,
<i>destroy the target or disengage.</i>
<i>I repeat,
destroy the target or disengage.</i>
Where's the...
This is President Laura Roslin
<i>aboard the Raptor, do not fire.</i>
Jam her transmission.
<i>... escape from the mutineers
that have taken over Galactica...</i>
Grabbed it, sir.
They're still on us.
Sit down, and hang on.
- Hot Dog, Narcho, target status report.
- <i>I don't know.</i>
That was the President,
she's on board the target.
We've got Adama and Tigh.
They were in the auxiliary airlock.
Put Tigh and Adama down
with the Cylon prisoners.
Belay that. Put Tigh with the Cylons.
Bring Adama up here now.
Understood.
Kareem, patch me through to Red Two.
Lieutenant Costanza,
Galactica actual,
<i>you were given an order,
now follow it.</i>
Stop frakking thinking
and shoot, Gods damn it.
Galactica, Narcho,
<i>tally, I have the target.
Maneuvering in position.</i>
- Frak, Narcho!
- <i>I'm in, I'm in.</i>
They've got a missile lock on us.
Missiles missed the target.
The Raptor boarded the baseship.
- Why are we under attack?
- Vipers are firing on our ship.
You're not under attack,
they're firing at us.
- What did you do?
- Their government has lost control.
Our government has not lost control.
Excuse me,
how would you describe it?
Adama is a fugitive.
Gaeta has an army,
and Zarek has control of Colonial One.
- Adama is free. Don't listen...
- The last time we saw Adama,
he was cornered in an airlock
with Tigh.
If you were forced to escape, Gaeta and
Zarek must've had substantial support.
They don't! We're here because a pilot
refused to shoot us down, tell him.
Yes, but the other pilot
had no qualms
about shooting down the President.
If they're willing to do that...
- It's not safe. We have to jump.
- I have to agree.
But what about the Four? Tyrol,
Anders, Tigh, they're still over there.
What about them?
If you jump,
you'll never see them again.
If you stay put, you give Adama
a chance to save them.
Put your ship
in the middle of the fleet.
Use the fleet for cover.
Give Adama some time.
- But what if...
- Gaeta won't jeopardize the fleet.
He doesn't have the guts.
Come on, do it!
Welcome back.
I had a feeling you wouldn't be
on that Raptor.
I care too much for this ship
to let it be overrun by rats.
Right.
If only you cared as much
about the people on it.
You have no frakkin' idea.
Well, then show me.
You want to save some lives?
Get on the radio and call Roslin.
Tell her to come back and surrender.
No.
I'll ask you one more time, Admiral.
Admiral.
Admiral.
You're the Admiral now.
So you call up Roslin.
Make her laugh.
All hands to battle stations.
Set condition one.
Gun battery, stand by.
Target bearing...
Sir. The baseship.
They're moving into the fleet.
They're hiding in the fleet.
Battle stations, stand down.
Marine, launch blue squadron,
have them quarantine the baseship.
Gage, spin up our FTL.
Alert the ship captains to do the same.
Kelly,
prepare for Mr. Zarek's arrival.
Now you're going to shoot me,
Mr. Gaeta.

Shall we save the kids?
And the attorney says, "Frakk'em."
And the priest says,
"Do we have time?"
Damn it.
This is President Laura Roslin.
This is the President speaking...
Hello!
Gods damn it.
It's okay,
he's going to feel better.
Wonder what Gaeta's gonna do.
In your case,
cut off one of your frakkin' legs.
I have a net over the baseship,
you didn't have to bring
the whole Quorum with you.
- If you're insisting on the trial.
- I'm insisting.
Then I want them
where I can keep an eye on them.
Look, I know
you want to do the right thing.
I'm sorry, I was under the impression
that you did too.
I do. But we need to move on.
We can't move on. Until people
have answered for what they've done.
Which begins with Adama.
One world at a time, Tom.
I don't suppose
anyone's gonna feed my dog.
The Admiral is charged with treason,
desertion,
giving aid and comfort to the enemy,
and gross dereliction of duty.
The punishment for these crimes
is death by firing squad.
Well, I'm not a very good shot.
The Admiral is entitled
to a court-martial.
We need a lawyer
to handle his defense.
They need a pimp.
Commander Gaeta
will represent the people.
Commander Gaeta...
Why are you doing this?
For justice.
Justice...
So it'd be fair to assume
that should I choose to
pass on this field trip for justice,
Winkin' and Blinkin' over there
will use me instead for target practice?
Just get on with your job.
Fine.
Bring in the judges.
I will be serving as judge.
I see, so we've run out
of ship's captains, then.
Captains are too busy
protecting their vessels
from the Cylon baseship
Admiral Adama welcomed into their fleet.
Shove it up your ass.
I don't need a frakking lawyer.
- You are charged with treason...
- By who?
- Desertion, giving comfort and aid...
- This is a joke.
- And you will answer for these crimes.
- Aid and comfort, yeah.
I did bathe and wash them.
Made their meals.
- I love the enemy.
- Could I have
a few minutes with Mr. Adama?
Just to impress upon him
the gravity of these charges?
Please?
You want him to understand,
I know you do.
Make it quick.
This is the President.
This is Laura Ros... Hello?
Hello? Hello?
We don't even have
the protection of the fleet.
They've scattered.
And the Viper patrols,
they've gotten bolder.
Some of them check their guns.
Firing into space is like
they're inviting us to react.
I think we should all talk.
"The world's upside down.
"And someone
has to turn it right side up again."
Felix Gaeta said that to me.
He believes he's that someone.
I believe he's that someone.
But he has very big shoes to fill.
I brought you here because
I wanted him to meet people who refuse
to give up, people who have
the courage to voice their dissent.
But at the end of the day,
still stand by your president.
I think you should leave now.
Mr. Vice President.
- So say we all.
- Hear, hear.
Shoot them.
Go get Mr. Gaeta.
- I never agreed to this!
- Yes, you did.
- No, this is murder!
- This is a coup.
That you began.
To take command and destroy our enemies,
before they destroy us.
What've you done?
This...
is what happens.
No, it's a lie.
This is all based on lies.
Don't you get it?
We had the truth on our side, now...
Now...
The truth is told
by whoever is left standing.
Adama has to go.
There's no turning back now.
Sorry.
It was a difficult choice
but we made our decision.
We're jumping away.
We have a chance to survive.
I'm sorry, I would've thought
as one of the Final Five,
you'd have a broader vision
than that.
If he hasn't done it already,
Gaeta will air lock Tigh,
Tyrol, Anders,
then he'll start with the rest.
- Kara, Helo, Adama...
- Don't. Stop.
His fate has been all but decided,
count on it.
- Please, don't.
- Ours isn't yet.
No one believed
that we would survive
the Cylon nuclear holocaust,
or the hell on New Caprica,
or the 50,000 other crises
we've lived through.
But we did, we're here.
We've made this veritable habit
out of defying the odds,
particularly William Adama.
And he is alive.
He is alive. And he will take
command of this fleet again.
And when that day comes,
he's gonna know...
who stuck with him and who ran.
Now who do you want to be?
Who do you want to be?
Hey, Chief.
Looking for a gun?
Hey, Aaron.
Sprung you, did they?
- Long live the revolution.
- Out.
Just shoot me now.
I'm too frakking tired to get out.
You're a frakking machine, get out.
That's right, I'm a machine.
What does that make you?
Dumbass?
This was a hell of a ship once.
It really was.
Heard your kid's not a Cylon.
Could have told you she was trouble.
Thanks.
Wouldn't have mattered.
Go on, keep going. Go!
Go on, skinjob, go.
Frak!
Forget it.
You think you can
get me to cooperate,
you'll get a pat on the back
instead of a bullet.
Don't let your pride get in the way.
Put your innocence on record
for the fleet.
- Your statement...
- I won't do a statement.
Gaeta and Zarek are gonna fail.
You really believe that?
What do you think?
I won't betray my beliefs
with a testimony.
You have people out there mobilizing,
I saw them.
Give them a chance to do something.
Stall or play dumb...
We've been ready to proceed
for some time.
Are you injured?
I believe the word is damaged.
No frakking way.
It's never gonna work.
Up close, I can take two of them
before you take your shots.
From back here with a side arm?
We only got one chance
to get this right.
And I'm gonna take it.
Grenade!
Never pulled the pin.
Not funny.
It would have been
if you'd thought of it.
No.
Not funny.
Tigh.
It's Kara.
It's Lee and Kara.
- Wait a minute. Where is he?!
- Can you hear me?
Bastards went to town on Helo.
- Where is my father?
- Kelly took him.
What? You were with him.
- What happened?
- I don't frakking know.
Come on, damn it. Let's get out
of here before they find us.
I have Hera.
You okay?
Go left.
- Kara, frak that, let's go.
- Got it, we'll catch up.
Sam!
Oh, Gods!
Oh, my Gods!
Look at me, look at me.
Do you hear me?
Kara! We can't stay here.
Watch his neck, Gods damn it.
We got to go! We got to move Sam.
Take Hera and go to Baltar's people.
No one wants to go near those nutjobs.
You'll be safe there.
- He's gonna bleed out.
- Don't move his head.
- Go, go!
- I can take care of myself.
You gotta help Sam!
Lee, go, get your father.
Now go.
Go!
Okay, get him to Cottle.
- Athena, go.
- Okay, company, move out!
Okay, let's move. Let's go.
Okay, baby. Okay.
You deserted us on New Caprica.
You let us twist in the wind.
I saved your frakking ass.
Why can't you just admit you've been
derelict in your duties as an officer?
You gave aid and comfort to the enemy,
you were about to grant them access...
- Objection, he's badgering the witness.
- ... to every ship in this fleet.
About to? I did it.
I gave them access.
And you know what?
I didn't give them aid and comfort.
They gave it to me.
<i>We just got word that Tigh
and the skinjobs escaped.</i>
<i>Don't worry. We're on it.</i>
Saul Tigh was killed
trying to escape.
I'm sorry.
But you did give
aid and comfort to the enemy.
Saul Tigh was a Cylon.
Even when you discovered that he was,
you let him remain the XO, didn't you?
I'm not answering any more questions
for you, Mr. Gaeta.
The prisoner is guilty as charged.
This isn't the trial.
This is an asylum.
We're done here.
<i>This is President Laura Roslin
speaking from the Cylon baseship.</i>
<i>Felix Gaeta has seized
Galactica by force.</i>
<i>The Cylons were defending themselves.
They will not harm you.</i>
- <i>I repeat, the Cylons will not harm...</i>
- Jam that signal.
Why, by the frak,
is she still broadcasting?
Where's Hoshi?
Get that little frak back into CIC.
<i>... shut down your FTL drives...</i>
It worked.
They couldn't jam it.
I thought this might do the trick.
Show me your frakking hands.
You have to help me
get him to Cottle.
No, no.
No, just on the way here,
me and my pen pal
were shot at two times.
Once by his own men.
Sorry.
He's gonna die.
I'm sorry.
Frak!
Ten ships shut down their FTL drives
after Roslin's transmission.
10 ships out of 35.
- Frakking Roslin.
- No, she did us a favor.
Now we're clear
who's with us and who's trouble.
Gage, give the jump coordinates
only to those ships
that kept their FTLs online.
- Order them to jump immediately.
- Yes, sir.
I need you to assemble
an execution detail.
Only men you can trust.
Secure the main
hangar deck launch tube.
Take Adama down there
and wait for me.
Can I count on you, Noel?
All down the line, sir.
Spying on me, Tom?
Let's just get through this
and move on, all right, Felix?
Where's the old man?
- Where's the old man?
- They're gonna shoot him.
Where?
- Where?!
- Main hangar deck launch tube.
Come on, come on,
let's go, Gods damn it.
I'm coming with you.
Detail ready.
Aim!
Fire!
No!
You were dreaming.
I couldn't wake you.
Oh, God, they're gonna shoot him.
I feel sick, I...
No.
This is all wrong. It's wrong.
Please, stop, stop.
But...
I wanna make you feel better.
Then cut off my legs.
I ran...
again.
I disappeared in the nick of time...
again.
Fear makes people
behave differently.
I didn't run out of fear.
Not this time, anyway.
I ran away from those people.
God, those people.
I've got a kind of following
on Galactica.
Like a fan club.
Publicly, I heeded them.
Privately, I scorned
their provincial intellects.
Their unfailing willingness
to make me feel better.
I have to go back.
I have to go back,
they're my responsibility.
I am sorry.
<i>Galactica...</i>
this is president Laura Roslin.
Release all those
being held against their will,
and return command of this fleet
<i>to admiral William Adama.</i>
<i>Surrender.</i>
<i>You have five minutes.</i>
Lieutenant Allison,
carry out the execution.
Yes, sir.
- Dad.
- Thank you, son.
- They told me you were dead.
- For a while, I was, Bill.
I want to take back my ship.
Lieutenant.
Sorry, sir.
I've always respected you.
But I hate the Cylons.
And I can't take orders
from a leader who won't fight them.
Colonel.
Stand down.
Tie him up.
Put me on speaker.
This is Tom Zarek,
President of the Twelve Colonies.
It's over, Laura.
<i>Saul Tigh was killed
attempting to escape.</i>
<i>Bill Adama</i>
was tried and found guilty
of his crimes.
<i>Firing squad executed him
this morning.</i>
<i>It's done, Laura.</i>
<i>You need to think</i>
about the people of this fleet now
and surrender.
No!
Not now,
not ever.
<i>Do you hear me?
I will use</i>
<i>every cannon,</i>
every bomb, every bullet,
every weapon I have
down to my own eyeteeth
to end you.
I swear it!
I'm coming for all of you!
So now we have a military leader
and a president all-in-one.
And how would you have answered her?
If you would have been here.
Baseship's arming itself, sir.
- Are we jump ready?
- Affirmative.
Set the rendez-vous jump coordinates.
Set your board to green.
There's been enough killing.
I'm leaving them behind.
Unless you object.
<i>Galactica,</i>
<i>this is President Laura Roslin.</i>
<i>Surrender.</i>
Gods damn it.
Board is green.
Counting it down.
Jump in ten.
<i>Nine.</i>
<i>Eight.</i>
Six.
Five.
<i>Four.</i>
<i>Three.</i>
FTL just went offline.
Get a crew.
Get someone down to the engine room.
Come on, move it!
Gaeta, launch your birds.
Wake up. What the frak are you doing?
Launch your birds!
Gaeta, we have to defend,
do you understand that?
Gaeta, we need to defend!
"One day soon,
there's gonna be a reckoning."
Gun batteries have fixed target bearing.
Standing by to fire.
Gaeta, what the frak
is wrong with you?
Wake up!
Weapons hold!
Give me a weapon.
- Put your weapons down.
- Drop your weapons!
- Connect me with the President.
- Right away, Admiral.
Madam President.
This is the Admiral. Stand down.
<i>I repeat,</i>
<i>Galactica's secured.</i>
Stand down.
Oh, no.
Suppose a long time ago, it was...
architecture.
There was a year there where
I scribbled floor plans
on everything.
Dining room table,
patio tiles, rare books...
Drove my parents crazy.
How old were you?
I don't know, eight, maybe nine.
I tell you one thing, though,
I had some frakking amazing ideas.
Restaurants shaped like food.
And top-heavy buildings, and stairways,
everything had to have a stairway.
Spoils of war.
When I was older,
then it became...
medicine and...
engineering, photography.
I think I would've made a better
architect than any of those, though.
And then, I discovered science.
And I...
I thought I was really,
really good at it.
Until I met you.
- Felix...
- Don't.
And please, no religion.
I'm fine with how things have
worked out. Really, Gaius, I am. I...
I just hope...
I hope that...
people realize,
eventually...
who I am.
I know who you are, Felix.
I know who you are.
Ready.
Aim.
It stopped.
Fire.

Peux-tu m'aider, s'il te plaīt ?
C'est bon. Tu peux bien faire ēa.

Ēa va aller.
La mutinerie est terminée.
Trop tōt pour le dire.
Il a une balle dans le cerveau.
- Enlevez-la !
- La colonie n'oublie jamais.
Tu vois cette tache claire ?
Un énorme hématome,
qui appuie sur le cerveau.
On va devoir percer et drainer.
Quand l'hématome aura réduit,
je ferai venir
le neurologue du Inchon Velle
et on verra
comment s'occuper de cette balle.
- L'esprit est un endroit ą part.
- Allez le chercher, putain.
On n'a pas encore besoin de lui.
Je peux percer moi-mźme.
- ... et un enfer du paradis.
- Je suis lą, Sam.

- avide de vengeance.

Il parle, mais peut pas t'entendre.
Bouclez-la et percez.

Bonjour, John.
Je n'aime pas ce nom.
Tu le sais.
Je t'ai donné le prénom de mon pčre.
Et tu m'as fait ą son image.
Merci infiniment.
J'aimerais un verre.
Si c'est pas trop demander.
J'imagine que tu es lą,
car ēa a mal tourné sur New Caprica
avec ton mari ?
J'ai trahi la résistance
et il m'a empoisonnée.
- L'amour, y a que ēa de vrai.
- Il a fait ce qui lui semblait juste.
L'Homme ne peut pas faire autrement.
Il n'est pas humain.
Je suis bien placée pour le savoir
et je m'inscris en faux.
C'est une machine, tout comme toi.
C'est une question de point de vue.
Tes ancźtres n'ont pas rampé
hors des marécages.
- J'en suis d'ailleurs assez fier.
- Tu n'as pas changé d'un pouce.
Détrompe-toi,
j'ai fait de grands progrčs.
Tu serais étonnée.
Et pourtant, tu es toujours
ce petit garēon perdu et irascible
que j'ai tant aimé,
il y a des d'années.
C'est triste.
J'avais placé tant d'espoirs en toi.
Et moi en toi.
Malheureusement,
il semble que tu préfčres fantasmer
plutōt que d'accepter
ta vie telle qu'elle est.
Les humains ont un mot pour ēa.
La schizophrénie.
Tu m'as appelée par mon nom,
c'est bien.
Ton cas n'est pas
totalement désespéré.
On en reparlera.
Il fait un peu froid.
Je vais te trouver des vźtements.
Aprčs tout, j'ai déją tout vu.
La mutinerie a fait assez de dégāts.
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
- J'ai vu ēa en retirant la bobine.
Vous devrez inspecter toute la coque
pour mesurer l'ampleur des dégāts.
Faites-le.
Pardon ?
Je sais que ce n'est pas
votre boulot.
Le fait est
que j'ai besoin d'un chef.
Et tout ce que j'ai, c'est un...
C'est un Galen.
En effet, monsieur.
Vous m'appelez encore "monsieur".
Je crois qu'on doit accepter
ce qu'on est.
Acceptez-vous ce titre, chef ?
- Je reste un Cylon.
- Pas de problčme.
Mon second aussi.
- Réparez mon vaisseau, chef.
- Ą vos ordres, amiral.
Kara.
J'ai tout vu.
Sam, je suis vraiment désolée.
J'aurais jamais dū te faire sortir.
J'aurais dū tuer...
C'est bon. C'est bon.
C'est pas bon,
ēa pourrait pas źtre pire.
Tu veux un coupable ? C'est moi.
Non, tout va bien. Kara, écoute-moi.
Une chose merveilleuse est arrivée.
Va chercher les autres.
Quels autres ?
Galen, Tory, Saul et Ellen.
S'il te plaīt.
Ellen est morte, Sam.
Bien sūr.
Bien sūr. Je sais.
Il y a trop de strates.
Va chercher les autres.
Dis-leur que je me souviens de tout.
La Terre.

12 MOIS PLUS TŌT
Je me suis souvent demandé
en quoi l'expérience mortelle
te changerait.
Je n'avais jamais envisagé
qu'elle ne te changerait...
aucunement.
Tu fais toujours ces suées nocturnes
et ces cauchemars
oł des garēons au visage de chien
te pourchassent dans la brume jaune ?
Dormir,
un bon exemple d'attribut humain
incroyablement improductif
que tu as étrangement inclus
dans notre programmation.
Heureusement,
j'ai pu effacer ce sous-programme.
Et j'ai cessé de dormir
il y a environ 20 ans.
Soit.
Si tu crois qu'on t'a empoisonné
de traits humains comme le sommeil,
et de valeurs centuriennes
comme la croyance en un Dieu vivant,
pourquoi as-tu passé
toutes ces années
ą źtre obnubilé
par des idées tellement humaines,
la vengeance, le meurtre ?
Pourquoi ne pas simplement essayer
d'źtre les meilleures
machines possible ?
Parce que la justice m'en empźche.
Mes aļeux, du cōté centurion,
ont été esclaves de l'humanité.
Je veux que justice soit faite.
Il y a d'autres voies, John.
Le déjeuner.
Ici, ma chčre.
Pose-le lą.
Tu connais cette Huit.
- C'est Sharon Valerii.
- Boomer.
Tu n'imagines pas comme c'est bon
de voir une connaissance.
Le vaisseau doit źtre plein
de mes enfants, au-delą des gardes.
Ne sois pas timide.
Dis-lui ce que ēa fait
d'źtre en présence
d'un des fabuleux Cinq.
Il prend un risque
en te présentant ą moi.
Il n'est pas facile
de gagner sa confiance.
- Comment tu as fait ?
- Nous avons établi de bonnes relations.
Vraiment ?
Tu es plein de surprises
aujourd'hui, John.
- C'est son vrai nom, au fait.
- Non, je le déteste.
Parle-moi des relations
que tu entretiens avec John.
Il m'apprend ą źtre
une meilleure machine.
- Ą me défaire de mes concepts humains.
- Et le "tourbillon" ?
- Il t'en a déją parlé ?
- Excusez-moi, j'ai des gens ą tuer.
Tu rougis, John.
Ce n'est que la tension défectueuse
de ce corps déplorable conēu par toi.
Non, tu devrais rester.
Reste pour avoir une conversation
ą coeur ouvert avec ton créateur.
Tu peux lui demander
pourquoi elle t'a conēue comme ēa :
autodestructrice, hyperémotive,
déchirée
par des impulsions conflictuelles.
Dis-lui combien ēa te rend heureuse.
Tu sais pourquoi il t'a amenée ?
Il aime źtre écouté.
Avoir quelqu'un qui acquiesce
quand il parle de justice.
Observe, Boomer.
Fais-toi ta propre idée.
On travaillait tous
dans le mźme labo.
Tu étais marié avec Ellen.
Vous deux viviez ensemble.
- En colocation ?
- Non,
vous étiez amoureux fous.
Vous prévoyiez de vous marier.
Quand la bombe est tombée,
j'ai sorti Ellen des décombres.
Elle a dit qu'on allait renaītre.
Ēa veut dire qu'on s'est téléchargés ?
Oui, dans un vaisseau
qu'on avait placé en orbite.
- On savait la fin proche.
- On avait été prévenus.
On s'est téléchargés.
Les Cylons terriens
pouvaient procréer.
- Pourquoi pas nous ?
- On a dū inventer la résurrection.
T'es glacé. T'as une balle dans la tźte.
Tu veux faire une pause ?
J'ai tant de choses ą dire.
On a pas inventé la résurrection.
On l'a réinventée.
Le transfert de mémoire organique
est venu de Kobol avec la 13e tribu.
La procréation l'a rendu obsolčte.
On a travaillé nuit et jour
pour le retrouver.
Ton travail était incroyable.
Mais c'est Ellen...
C'est Ellen qui a trouvé
comment remettre le systčme en route...
J'avais dit 5 minutes.
Ēa fait une demi-heure.
Par les Dieux, tu es en nage.
- Il disait que ēa allait.
- Ishay, ramčne-toi.
- On allait oł ? C'était quoi, le plan ?
- Vous źtes peut-źtre le XO,
mais c'est moi qui décide ici.
Maintenant, tout le monde dehors.
Il disait que ēa allait.
Par les Dieux.
Par les Dieux, tant de morts.
Regardez cette photo de Jacob.
Elle est horrible.
Il l'aurait détestée. J'essaie...
J'essaie d'en trouver une autre
parce que tout le monde la verra au mur.
Vous źtes sūre de vouloir źtre ici ?
Oui, absolument.
C'est une faēon...
tellement absurde
et horrible de mourir.
Ils essayaient seulement
de nous garder civilisés.
Il m'est arrivé de les haļr,
mais je connaissais chacun d'eux.
Qui sommes-nous, sans eux ?
Justement, j'y ai réfléchi.
Nous avons besoin d'un nouveau Quorum
ou d'autre chose.
Ces vieilles plančtes...
Ēa ne nous représente plus.
Nous sommes une flotte dorénavant,
notre quotidien est défini
par notre vaisseau.
Nous ne sommes plus Capricans.
Nous sommes du Galactica,
du Colonial One.
On devrait l'accepter.
Je trouve que c'est
une excellente observation, Lee.
Vous devriez garder ēa ą l'esprit
quand vous réunirez
de nouveaux représentants.
- Quand je réunirai les représentants ?
- Je garderai le titre honorifique
de présidente, mais...
Vous pouvez faire bien plus.
Non, Lee.
Il est temps que je confie
mon fardeau ą quelqu'un d'autre.
Je ne sais pas quoi dire.
Je serais honoré,
si vous pensez que j'en suis capable.
Vous en źtes capable, Lee.
Vous l'avez toujours été.
La seule chose qui me préoccupe,
c'est que vous voulez tellement
faire ce qui est juste
que, parfois, vous ne faites pas
ce qui est malin.
J'essaierai d'źtre plus malin.
Et moins juste.
Je vous avertis,
c'est pas beau ą voir.
Putain.
Il y en a combien comme ēa ?
Une douzaine
tout le long du vaisseau.
Si ēa cčde, la coque va se refermer
en claquant comme un livre.
D'oł ēa vient ?
Le Galactica avait 50 ans
au début de la guerre.
Il a subi des épreuves
qui auraient broyé d'autres vaisseaux.
Des entrées violentes
dans l'atmosphčre.
Le cahier des charges
n'a pas été respecté.
Ą de multiples endroits,
le carénage est trop fin.
Et les boulons sont trop petits.
Ils ont rogné sur les coūts ?
Oui.
Mais ces grandes fissures,
elles sont nettes.
Je peux les réparer.
Il faut l'immobiliser quelque temps.
Je peux encore
en faire quelque chose.
D'accord.
Mais l'équipe...
Je ne veux que des humains,
d'accord ?
Bien, amiral.
Pourquoi est-on allés
sur les 12 colonies ?
On devait avertir les autres tribus.
On savait qu'ils créeraient
des vies artificielles.
On devait leur dire...
de bien les traiter, de les surveiller.
Mais le temps qu'on arrive,
ils étaient déją en guerre
contre les Centurions.
Mais l'holocauste sur Terre a eu lieu
des milliers d'années avant.
- Comment est-ce possible ?
- On avait pas le FTL.
On voyageait ą vitesse subluminique.
Le temps passait lentement pour nous,
des milliers d'années avaient passé.
Donnez-moi une seconde.
- Cottle a dit d'arrźter...
- Kara, ēa va. Je dois le faire.
Tu te souviens du Demetrius.
Tu sais qu'on est parfois obligé d'agir.
- Je l'ai su.
- Si j'avais des réponses pour toi,
sur ton retour,
sur ce que tu es censée faire,
tu les voudrais, non ?
Tu les as ?
Kara, non. Peut-źtre...
Tant de choses me reviennent.
S'il te plaīt. Laisse-moi continuer.
Les Centurions essayaient déją
de fabriquer des corps de chair.
Ils avaient créé des hybrides,
mais non viables,
alors on a passé un marché :
la paix, contre notre aide.
On a développé 8 modčles humanoļdes
et on leur a donné la résurrection.
Huit ?
Tu as dit huit.
Il nous en manque un.
Tout le monde brille.
Prévenez Cottle !
Allez le chercher !
Dr Cottle !
J'ai toujours aimé les diaporamas.
Photos de vacances ?
- Tu sais ce que c'est.
- Le Temple des Espoirs,
construit par la 13e tribu,
il y a 3 000 ans,
quand ils ont quitté Kobol.
Ils ont prié pour qu'on les guide
durant leur exode.
- Et Dieu leur a indiqué la Terre.
- Maintenant,
c'est un monument ą ta vanité.
Le Temple des Cinq.
Joli coup, l'explosion de l'étoile.
Quand elle a explosé,
l'un de tes enfants
a vu vos visages.
Une des Trois.
Celle qui se fait appeler D'Anna.
Alors, j'ai archivé son modčle.
L'archivage n'est pas définitif.
Contrairement au sort du numéro 7.
C'est réversible.
Je ne le ferai pas.
En jouant cette comédie,
pour révéler vos visages,
- tu ne m'as pas laissé le choix.
- C'était pas une comédie.
Nous avons suivi
la route de nos ancźtres,
et trouvé leur temple.
Le vrai Dieu a dū orchestrer ēa.
John ?
Au cours de tes voyages,
as-tu déją vu une supernova ?
Moi, si.
J'ai vu une étoile exploser
et semer les graines de l'univers,
d'autres étoiles, d'autres plančtes,
et un jour, d'autres vies.
Une supernova.
La création incarnée.
J'étais lą. Je voulais le voir.
Participer ą cet instant.
Tu sais comment j'ai perēu
l'un des évčnements
les plus glorieux de l'univers ?
Avec ces ridicules orbes gélatineux
enfoncés dans mon crāne.
Avec ces yeux conēus pour percevoir
une infime fraction
du spectre électromagnétique.
Des oreilles conēues pour n'entendre
que les vibrations de l'air.
Nous voulions que vous soyez
aussi humains que possible.
Je ne veux pas źtre humain !
Je veux voir les rayons gamma.
Je veux entendre les rayons X.
Et je veux...
Je veux sentir la matičre noire.
Tu vois l'absurdité de ma nature ?
Je ne peux mźme pas
l'exprimer correctement
parce que je dois
conceptualiser des idées complexes
ą travers ce langage
stupide et limité.
Mais je veux toucher
avec autre chose
que ces pattes préhensiles.
Et sentir le vent solaire
d'une supernova sur moi.
Je suis une machine.
Je pourrais connaītre
et expérimenter tant de choses.
Mais je suis piégé
dans ce corps absurde.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que
mes cinq créateurs pensaient
que c'était la volonté de Dieu.
Tu as quelque chose ą dire ?
Tu n'éprouves pas de regret
pour ce que tu lui as fait ?
Et ą nous ?
Il a tort, Boomer.
Il n'y a pas besoin
de regrets ou de reproches.
On ne vous a pas limités.
On vous a fait un don fabuleux.
Le libre-arbitre.
La capacité de penser
avec créativité,
de tendre la main avec compassion,
- d'aimer.
- Aimer ?
Qui ?
Les humains ?
Pourquoi ?
Qui aimerais-je ?
Ils y sont toujours ?
L'heure tourne, faut qu'on lui parle.
T'as entendu ce qu'il a dit.
On a appris aux Centurions
ą faire des synthétiques
capables de résurrection.
Ēa remonte ą nous.
Non, il a dit qu'on avait mis fin
ą la premičre guerre cylon.
On a gagné du temps pour l'humanité.
Le patron a dit un jour que l'Homme
doit assumer ses créations.
Nous avons créé les synthétiques.
C'est notre oeuvre.
La destruction des colonies.
Mais ce sont les humains
qui nous ont créés sur Kobol.
Au final, c'est toujours eux.
Si tu raisonnes comme ēa,
c'est la faute d'un germe
qui s'est divisé en deux.
La responsabilité
est peut-źtre partagée,
mais on ne peut pas
les blāmer pour tout.
Ils font quoi ?
Une radio de son cerveau.
Un genre de scanner.
Non, c'est vrai.
Cette crise a été bénéfique.
Ēa m'a permis de faire cette radio.
Et regardez... C'est votre balle.
Elle s'est logée
dans l'anneau vasculaire.
Le point de convergence des artčres.
C'est ce qui relie les pensées
entre elles. On en a besoin.
Je vais bien. Je suis lą.
Ce qui est fascinant,
c'est l'érosion de ce vaisseau sanguin.
Il était percé.
Un infime jet de sang
qui a provoqué votre attaque.
C'est remarquable.
Mais si ēa se reproduit,
ēa peut causer
une hémorragie fatale trčs rapide.
Retirez cette putain de balle.
Et il faut réparer ce vaisseau.
L'oedčme ayant diminué,
- on a peut-źtre une chance.
- Attendez.
Ces souvenirs que je retrouve.
- Je risque de les perdre ?
- Quand on trifouille le cerveau,
il y a toujours une possibilité
de dommages annexes.
Alors, il faut qu'on attende
que je... le cercle... commence...
- Les mots sont...
- Il tourne pas rond.
- Pourquoi ?
- L'aphasie. Ēa affecte la parole.
On parle de "salade de mots".
C'est courant.
Starbuck, ce garēon a une balle
qu'on doit extraire
et il veut attendre.
Si je laisse le choix ą sa femme,
que décide-t-elle ?
Attendez, quoi ?
Non, c'est pas la premičre ouverture...
C'est pas...
C'est pas le moteur aléatoire...
C'est... Merde.
Bordel de Dieux.
Kara, je vais bien.
Ēa va. D'accord ? Je vais bien.
M'enlčve pas ēa, s'il te plaīt.
Il me faut plus de temps.
Préparez-le pour l'opération.
S'il te plaīt.
Il me faut plus de temps.
Tant de choses me reviennent.
Juste un moment.
Jusqu'ą ce qu'ils t'endorment.
Mais pas plus.
C'est... Jusqu'ą ce qu'ils m'endorment,
et tant que...
Tu connais les mots, Sam.
Si je peux finir le cercle,
j'aurai les mots.
L'image est
remarquablement claire.
QUATRE MOIS PLUS TŌT
Voilą un réveil agréable.
Il s'est passé quelque chose.
Ils ont détruit
le centre de résurrection.
Vous avez commencé
ą considérer votre mortalité ?
Plus que ēa.
Notre extinction.
- Toujours si dramatique.
- C'est vrai, Ellen.
On ne peut pas procréer,
nous allons donc devoir
recréer la résurrection.
Bonne chance.
Ce n'est pas de la chance
qu'il nous faut.
Mais ton aide.
Ils ont détruit le centre,
mais ne savent pas pour la colonie.
Votre équipement y est toujours.
Je ne connais pas
tout le systčme, John.
Ą nous cinq, on le pourrait
peut-źtre, et encore...
- Tu mens.
- Non, John.
N'insulte pas mon intelligence.
Tes enfants meurent, Ellen.
Et tu ne lčveras pas le petit doigt
pour nous sauver ?
Pourquoi ? Par vengeance ?
Parce que je refuse
d'embrasser votre orthodoxie ?
Voilą la vérité sur les Cinq.
Dis-le-nous.
- Pour la résurrection.
- Je peux pas. Il faut les autres.
Tu vois, elle me force.
Tu n'es pas meilleure que les humains
qui nous ont asservis.
Si tu ne me dis pas
comment recréer la résurrection,
je vais t'ouvrir le crāne...
et chercher dedans.
Le cerveau est merveilleux.
C'est un réseau électrique.
Il me suffit de l'ouvrir,
de stimuler le bon endroit,
et je peux déclencher
tes souvenirs les plus enfouis.
Ta culpabilité
et tes peurs enfouies.
Et mźme la recette
de la vie éternelle.
On a créé Cavil en premier ?
John.
On l'adorait.
Il nous a aidés
ą créer les autres.
On pensait
que c'était une bonne idée
de créer des Cylons
aprčs avoir vu le cycle ?
Les Centurions
avaient un Dieu unique.
Selon Ellen, ēa changeait tout.
Si les Cylons étaient capables
d'amour et de compassion,
alors la violence s'arrźterait.
- Un dieu ? Un dieu seul et unique ?
- Ouais.
- Ēa vient des Centurions ?
- Ouais.
Cavil rejetait la compassion.
Sa moralité était faussée.
Alors, il s'est retourné
contre nous.
Il nous a enfermés dans un truc.
La poche.
C'est un compartiment.
- Et il a coupé l'oxygčne.
- Il nous a étouffés.
- Il nous a tués.
- Ouais.
En retrouvant de nouveaux corps...
Il a bloqué l'accčs ą nos livres...
Non...
Nos souvenirs...
- Et nous en a implantés de faux.
- Oui.
Comme pour Boomer.
Des souvenirs qu'on croyait réels.
Il a dū nous archiver un moment,
puis envoyer Saul,
peu aprčs la guerre,
puis la gazelle.
La... Ellen.
Sur Terre,
les signaux étaient différents
pour chacun de nous.
J'ai vu une femme.
Tory, un homme.
Personne d'autre ne les voyait.
- Galen, tu croyais...
- C'est l'heure.
Écoute-moi.
Parle-moi du Sept.
Oui, le Sept...
Le Sept, c'était Daniel.
- Tu es sūr du nom ?
- Oui.
Il est mort.
C'était le Sept.
- Emmenez-le.
- J'en suis sūr. C'était Daniel.
- Faut finir.
- Laissez-le.
Saul, écoute-moi.
Reste avec la flotte.
Ēa commence tout juste.
C'est le miracle.
C'est un cadeau des anges.
Reste avec la flotte !
Kara, arrźte-les !
Je t'ai défendue sur le Demetrius !
Tu me dois ēa !
Kara !
Saul ? Alors ?
T'es réveillée.
Oł est la gnōle ?
Ēa fait des semaines
qu'on n'en a plus.
Tu te souviens ?
L'odeur me rendait malade.
Des semaines ?
Contente que tu sois rentré.
Qu'est-ce qu'il a dit ?
Cottle nous a virés.
Il a pas pu finir.
Désolée.
Il y a du nouveau.
Il s'est mis ą bouger
comme s'il vivait enfin.
Pile ce soir ?
Je sens rien.
Attends, il va recommencer.
Tu sais,
on devrait trouver...
un berceau...
et tout ce dont un bébé a...
Il a bougé.
Je l'ai senti, cette fois.
J'ai senti mon fils bouger.
Il veut sortir jouer.
Ēa date un peu, non ?
Il lui faut un bandeau
sur l'oeil droit.
Je préfčre me souvenir de Saul
avant que tu lui aies fait ēa.
Sentimentale jusqu'au bout.
Les Simon préparent la salle d'op.
Tu seras étonnée par nos progrčs
pour extraire des souvenirs.
Mais c'est long.
Je suis sūre que tu feras en sorte
que ce soit long et douloureux.
Tu te trompes,
je n'y prends aucun plaisir.
Voyons, John.
Bien sūr que si. Tu es un sadique.
Pourquoi ne pas simplement
nous tuer ?
Pourquoi nous envoyer vivre
chez les humains ?
Je voulais
que vous les observiez de prčs.
Je vous ai offert un holocauste,
aux premičres loges.
Mais nous avons survécu.
Et tu as décidé
que nous n'avions pas assez souffert.
Alors, tu m'as placée
dans une navette,
tu as confessé Galen,
puis joué avec Sam le résistant,
et torturé Saul, mais sans le tuer.
Tu as eu une douzaine d'occasions.
Mais tu as attendu qu'ą la fin,
ą notre résurrection, nous soyons prźts
ą admettre nos torts,
ą te remercier de nous avoir donné
juste ce qu'il faut
de souffrance et de chātiments,
tout bien pesé.
Afin de recevoir l'approbation
que tu désires depuis toujours.
Tu prétends źtre
une machine parfaite.
Mais tu es guidé par les émotions
les plus mesquines.
La jalousie
et la rage.
Je sais ce que tu as fait ą Daniel.
Les Sept ne se sont pas développés.
Quel dommage.
Dommage que nous ne soyons pas faits
dans une matičre plus solide.
Le métal.
Ēa serait pas mal.
Daniel était un artiste,
d'une grande sensibilité.
J'étais trčs proche de lui.
Mais John a décidé
que c'était du favoritisme.
Peut-źtre était-ce le cas.
Quelqu'un a contaminé
le liquide amniotique
dans lequel grandissaient les Daniel.
Ce qui a corrompu leur génome.
Je savais que c'était John.
Envieux.
- Sadique.
- Et qui m'a fabriqué ?
C'est de ēa qu'il s'agit,
n'est-ce pas ?
Si je suis irrécupérable,
si je suis une grossičre erreur,
une défaillance,
ą qui la faute ?
La faute de mon créateur.
Ce n'est pas Dieu, mais toi !
- Tu es responsable.
- Non, John.
Mon Dieu, non.
Tu as commis des actes trčs graves.
Mais tu n'es pas une erreur.
Si tu pouvais t'accepter
tel que tu es,
comme le garēon que j'ai conēu,
tu pourrais źtre bon.
Tu pourrais źtre qui tu veux.
Je t'aime, John,
parce que je t'ai créé.
Ēa va aller.
Ēa va aller, John.
- Ēa...
- Je t'interdis !
Je dois me préparer
pour l'opération.
J'ai hāte de contempler la perfection
de l'intérieur.
Non, lą-bas. Ouais.
Ą travers la poutre.
Pas le long !
Pose un support ici.
Je sais reconnaītre
du rafistolage, chef.
Il n'y a pas
que les fissures, amiral.
Je pense aux dommages invisibles.
En profondeur.
Visibles uniquement aux rayons X.
- Dealino, mets en route.
- OK, chef. C'est branché.
On a badigeonné les poutres
avec un liquide fluorescent.
C'est pas des rayons X,
mais ēa donne une idée.
Tout le vaisseau est comme ēa.
Des fissures
dans toutes les poutres.
Ses os sont touchés.
Ses os sont pourris.
Sur les vaisseaux-mčres,
il y a une chose qui pourrait servir.
Une technologie cylon ?
Une résine organique
qui pousse dans le métal.
Qui supporterait les charges,
une fois ą maturité.
"Ą maturité" ?
- C'est biologique.
- Hors de question, chef.
Amiral, vous źtes venu me chercher,
pour ce job.
- Ą quel point vous tenez ą la vie ?
- Non.
Je suis désolée.
Vraiment désolée.
J'ai été trop gourmande.
J'ai attendu trop longtemps.
Je pensais źtre le numéro 7.
J'ai besoin d'exister.
Je serai lą ą ton réveil.
Et je t'accorderai
le temps que tu veux.
On découvrira tous les secrets.
OK. C'est parti.
Kara, il est temps de partir.
- Merci.
- Allez. Écarteur.
Merci.
Tu supportes ?
De savoir qu'il te hait,
pour ce que tu as fait ?
Il ne me hait peut-źtre pas.
L'amour est comme ēa, parfois.
Les Simon sont prźts ą opérer.
Ils veulent que tu portes ēa.
Un accessoire pour légitimer
le petit jeu de John ? Non, merci.
Tu aurais dū prendre un tombereau.
Peu importe.
Finissons-en.
C'est pas fini ?
Le Doc avait dit 2 heures.
Ēa fait bien plus longtemps.
Il nous a manqué un peu de temps.
Je voulais l'interroger
sur la chanson.
- Quand il sortira.
- Starbuck,
j'ai quelque chose pour toi.
Voilą ta balle.
Doc l'a extraite
et a réparé l'artčre.
Il vivra.
- Quand va-t-il se réveiller ?
- Il devrait déją l'źtre.
C'est pas forcément
un mauvais signe.
Son cerveau se répare.
On va faire un électro-encéphalogramme
pour en savoir plus.
Vas-y.
Boomer, tu y as vraiment réfléchi ?
Oui.
Tu le regretteras.
Assurément.
- Que fais-tu ?
- Je te pardonne.
Tu vas te remettre.
Une bande de Cylons enragés
t'attend dehors,
impatients d'entendre
le chapitre suivant de leur vie.
Ils espčrent une comédie musicale.
Tu ferais bien de guérir vite.
Ils deviennent méchants.
- Vous fatiguez pas.
- Pardon ?
Il n'y a plus d'activité cérébrale.
Il entend rien.
Il est parti.
Passez-moi le chef.
Ici, le chef.
Chef...
faites le nécessaire pour le sauver.
Ą vos ordres.
I could use a drink.
You've always been there for me
when I need you.
- You just go to sleep.
- I'm sleepy.
I'm so exhausted.
<i>I'd do it all again.</i>
Will you help me up, please?
It's okay. You can do that much.
Thank you.
You're very kind.
Among bright stars, I'm lost.
- You're not lost. I'm right here.
- There's a new tide.
And all the forgotten faces,
all the forgotten children...
we seek
the great forgotten language.
It's gonna be okay.
We made it through the mutiny.
Not yet, he hasn't.
He's got a bullet in his brain.
- Then take it out!
- The colony never forgets.
See that pale spot over there?
That's a massive hematoma
pressing on his brain.
We gotta drill holes in his skull
and drain it.
When the swelling goes down, I'll bring
the brain guy over from Inchon Velle
and we get a look and see
how we can get at that bullet.
- The mind is its own place.
- Get the frakkin' brain guy.
We don't need a specialist yet.
I can drill.
- And a hell of heaven.
- I'm right here, Sam.
He whose guile...
- stirred with revenge.
- I'm right here, Sam.
I'm not gonna go anywhere.
Give it a rest, Starbuck.
He's talking, but he can't hear you.
Just shut up and drill.
And all the forgotten faces...
We seek...
He's in pain!
That's just a reflex.
We'd been to that beach too.
Yes, we'd been to that beach.
Sometimes Ellen would be there too.
Because she loved the water.
She loved the water.
Hello, John.
I don't care for that name.
I think you know that.
I named you after my father.
And you made me in his image.
Thanks a million for that.
I'd love a drink, John.
If it's not too much trouble.
I take it you're here
because things didn't go very well
down on New Caprica
with you and the mister?
I betrayed the resistance,
and he poisoned me.
- Nothing like true love.
- He did what he thought was right.
That's all any man can do.
He's not a man.
As someone with first-hand knowledge,
I beg to differ.
He's a machine. So are you.
I think that depends
on how you define things.
Your ancestors
didn't crawl up out of the swamp.
Personally,
I'm rather proud of that.
You really haven't changed at all,
have you?
On the contrary,
I've made vast improvements.
You'd be astonished.
And yet, you're still
the same confused
and petulant little boy
I loved so dearly
all those years ago.
It's sad.
I had such high hopes for you.
And I for you.
Unfortunately, it appears
you still stick to delusional thinking
instead of accepting
the reality of your life for what it is.
Humans have a word for that, Ellen.
Schizophrenia.
You used my name, John.
That's good.
There's hope for you yet.
We'll talk later.
John.
It's a bit cold in here.
I'll get you some clothes.
After all, I've seen it all before.
The mutiny did enough damage.
Now what?
I first noticed it
when I pulled the sync coil.
You're gonna need to go all the way down
to the hull to see how far down it goes.
Do it.
Excuse me?
I know it's not your job.
Thing is, is I need a chief.
And all I have is a...
is a Galen.
That you do, sir.
See, you still call me "sir".
I think we have to accept
what we are.
Will you accept the title, Chief?
- I'm still a Cylon.
- It's all right.
So's my XO.
- Fix my ship, Chief.
- Yes, sir, Admiral.
Kara.
I've seen everything.
- Sam, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- No, no.
I never should have taken you out of
that jail cell. I should have killed...
No. It's okay. It's okay.
It's about as far from okay
as it could possibly be.
You wanna blame someone? Blame me.
No, it's all right.
Kara, listen to me.
A wonderful thing has happened.
You have to get the others.
What others?
Galen and Tory
and Saul and Ellen. Please.
Ellen's dead, Sam.
Of course.
Of course. I know.
There's too many layers.
Just get the rest of them.
Please tell them
I remember everything.
Earth.
Why we're here.
Everything.
I've seen everything.
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA
Season 4 - Episode 15
Subtitles
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-
You know, I've often wondered
what changes the mortal experience
would have on you.
I never seriously considered
the answer would be
virtually none.
Do you still suffer from night sweats
and scary dreams
of dog-faced boys
chasing you through the yellow mists?
Sleep...
that's a good example of a supremely
unproductive human attribute
that for some reason
you chose to write into our software.
Fortunately, I was able to delete
that particular subroutine.
And I stopped sleeping
about 20 years ago.
Fine.
If you really think we poisoned you
with human traits like sleep,
and Centurion values
like belief in a living God,
why then did you spend
all these years
in single-minded pursuit
of such human ideas
as vengeance and murder?
Why not just choose to explore
this notion of being
the best machines
the universe has ever known?
Because justice pulls me back.
My forebears
on the Centurion side of the family
were the slaves of humanity.
And I want justice for that.
Doesn't have to be this way, John.
Lunch has arrived.
Here, dear.
Put it here.
I believe you've met this Eight.
- You knew her as Sharon Valerii.
- Boomer.
I can't tell you how good it is
to see another person I know.
I'm assuming there's a whole ship full
of my children out beyond the guards.
There's no need to be shy.
Tell her how it feels
to be in the resplendent presence
of one of the fabulous Final Five.
He's taking a risk,
exposing you to me.
It's not easy winning his trust.
- How'd you do it?
- We achieved a certain rapport.
Really?
You're full of surprises
today, John.
- That's his real name, by the way.
- No it's not. I hate it.
Tell me more about this rapport
you have with John.
He's teaching me
to be a better machine.
To let go of my human constructs.
What about the swirl?
Has he taught you that yet?
If you'll excuse me,
I have some people to kill.
Why, John, I think you're blushing.
It's just the faulty blood pressure
in this miserable body
you designed for me.
No, no, no.
You should stay.
Stay and have a heart-to-heart
with your creator here.
You can ask her
why she made you the way you are.
Self-destructive. Hyper emotional.
Torn apart by conflicting impulses.
Tell her how extraordinarily happy
this makes you.
You know why he brought you in here?
He likes an audience.
Someone to nod
when he talks about justice.
Watch, Boomer.
Make up your own mind.
We all worked
in the same research facility. You
and Ellen, you were married then too.
You two lived together.
- What, like roommates?
- No,
you were madly in love.
You were planning on getting married.
When the nukes hit,
I pulled Ellen out of the rubble.
She said we'd be reborn.
Does that mean we downloaded somewhere?
Yeah, on a ship that we placed
in orbit around the planet.
- So we knew the end was coming.
- We'd been warned, yeah.
- We downloaded.
- Yeah.
But the Cylons on Earth
could have children.
- Why did we even have that technology?
- Probably invented resurrection.
You're cold as ice. You have a bullet
in your head. You wanna take a break?
I still have so much more to tell them.
We didn't invent resurrection.
Okay, we reinvented it.
Organic memory transfer came from Kobol,
along with the 13th Tribe.
It fell out of use
after our people started to procreate.
We worked night and day
to rebuild it. Galen,
your work was amazing.
But it was Ellen...
It was Ellen who made the intuitive leap
that brought the system back online...
I said you could have five minutes.
It's been over a half an hour.
Good Gods, man.
You're soaked in sweat.
- He said he was okay.
- Ishay, get in here.
- What was the plan?
- Look, Colonel, you may be the XO,
but in sick bay, I call the shots.
Now everybody, out, right now.
Out, out, out.
He said he was okay.
Gods.
Gods, so much killing.
Look at this picture of Jacob.
This is just a terrible picture.
He'd hate it. I'm trying...
I'm trying to find another one because
everyone will see it up on that wall.
You sure you want to be here?
Yes, I definitely want to be here.
It's such a...
senseless, horrible way to die.
These people only wanted
to try and keep us civilized.
Sometimes I hated them,
but I knew every one of them,
and now I wonder
who we are without them.
Well, actually, I've been thinking.
We need a new Quorum
or something else.
These... these old planets,
that's not who we are anymore.
We're a fleet now, and
our daily lives are defined
by the ship we're on.
We're not Capricans anymore.
We're from Galactica.
We're from Colonial One.
Maybe we should acknowledge that.
I think that that's a very
excellent observation, Lee,
and I think
that you should keep it in mind
when you are assembling
new representatives.
- When I assemble new representatives?
- I will, of course, remain by title
as President, but...
You can do a lot more than that.
No, I can't, Lee.
It's time I let someone else
do the heavy lifting.
I don't know what to say.
I would be honored
if you think I'm the right one.
You are the right one, Lee.
You have always been the right one.
My only concern about you
is that you're so hell-bent
on doing the right thing
that you sometimes
don't do the smart thing.
I'll try and be smarter.
And wronger.
I gotta warn ya. It looks bad.
Frak me.
How many are like this?
There's about a dozen bad spots,
the length of the ship.
If they go,
this thing'll slam shut like a book.
How'd it get this bad?
Galactica was 50 years old
when the war started.
Put her through some things
that would crush lesser ships.
Slammed her down on the atmosphere.
Most ships aren't built to spec.
There's lots of places
where the skin's too thin.
And the bolts are just too small.
You're frakkin' telling me
they cut corners?
Yeah, they did.
But these big cracks,
it's a good, clean break.
I can fix that, you just...
Just don't jump her for a while.
I can squeeze
some more life out of her.
Okay.
But the crew...
I want it all human, all right?
Yes, sir.
So why did we go to the 12 colonies?
We needed to find the other tribes
and warn them.
We knew they would continue
to create artificial life.
We needed to tell them...
Treat them well. Keep 'em close.
But by the time we got to the colonies,
they were already at war
with the Centurions. It happened again.
But the holocaust on Earth took place
thousands of years before that.
- How is that possible?
- We hadn't developed jump drives.
We traveled at relativistic
but subluminal speed.
Time slowed down for us,
but thousands of years had passed...
Just give me a second.
- Cottle said to stop...
- Kara, I'm fine. I have to do this.
You remember the Demetrius. You know
what it is when you've something to do.
I used to.
If I had the answers for you...
The answers about why you came back,
what you're supposed to do,
you would want me
to tell you, right?
Do you?
Kara, no.
But so much is coming back.
Maybe.
Please. Let me keep going.
The Centurions were already
trying to make flesh bodies.
They had created the hybrids,
but nothing that lived on its own,
so we made them a deal:
you stop the war, and we'll help you.
We developed the eight humanoid models,
and we gave them resurrection.
Eight?
You said eight.
We're missing someone.
Everybody's glowing.
Get Doc Cottle! Get him.
Get Doc Cottle!
Get Doc Cottle!
I always did love a good slideshow.
Vacation snaps?
You know what it is.
The Temple of Hopes,
built by the 13th tribe
3,000 years ago
when they left Kobol.
They stopped and prayed for guidance
during their exodus,
and then God showed them
the way to Earth.
And now it's a monument
to your vanity.
The Temple of the Five.
Nice touch, the exploding star.
When the star went nova,
one of your children saw your faces.
One of the Threes.
The one who called herself D'Anna.
So I just boxed her entire line.
Boxing isn't permanent.
Not like number Seven.
You can undo it.
It's not likely.
By planting that carnival trick
to reveal your own faces,
- you left me no choice.
- We didn't plant anything.
We backtracked the path
of our ancestors,
found their temple.
The one true God must have
orchestrated these events.
John?
In all your travels,
have you ever seen a star supernova?
Well, I have.
I saw a star explode
and send out the building blocks
of the universe.
Other stars, other planets,
and eventually, other life.
A supernova.
Creation itself.
I was there. I wanted to see it.
And be part of the moment.
And you know how I perceived
one of the most glorious events
in the universe?
With these ridiculous
gelatinous orbs in my skull.
With eyes designed to perceive
only a tiny fraction
of the EM spectrum.
With ears designed only to hear
vibrations in the air.
The five of us designed you
to be as human as possible.
I don't want to be human!
I want to see gamma rays.
I want to hear x-rays.
And I want to...
I want to smell dark matter.
Do you see
the absurdity of what I am?
I can't even express
these things properly
because I have to...
I have to conceptualize complex ideas
in this stupid limiting
spoken language.
But I know I want
to reach out with something
other than these prehensile paws
and feel the solar wind
of a supernova flowing over me.
I'm a machine.
And I could know much more.
I could experience so much more.
But I'm trapped in this absurd body.
And why?
Because my five creators thought
that God wanted it that way.
You have something to say?
Don't you feel
the slightest bit of remorse
for what you did to him?
What you did to us?
Because he's wrong, Boomer.
There's no need
for remorse or blame.
We didn't limit you.
We gave you something wonderful.
Free will.
The ability to think creatively.
To reach out to others
with compassion.
- To love.
- Love?
Who?
Humans?
Why would I want to do that?
Who would I want to love?
Are they still in there?
We're running out of time.
You heard what he said, right?
The Centurions
couldn't build skin jobs,
so we showed them how,
then gave them resurrection.
It all traces back to us.
No, he said that we ended
the first Cylon war.
We bought time for humanity, right?
The old man said
humans had to own up to what they made.
But we made the skin jobs.
It's all about what we made.
The destruction of the colonies.
But the humans on Kobol made us.
Go back far enough,
it's always them.
Yeah, you point a finger
back far enough
and some germ gets blamed
for splitting in two.
Maybe we share the guilt
with the humans,
but we don't get
to just shove it off onto them.
What are they doing?
Some picture of his brain.
Some kind of scan of something.
No, it's true. In a way,
the seizure was actually a good thing.
It let me get in there
and take this new picture.
Look what I found.
That's your bullet.
You see how it's lodged there
in the vascular ring.
That's where all of the major arteries
converge.
The vascular ring,
that's what binds the thoughts
in tight sheaves in the field,
you need that.
I'm good. I'm here.
I'm good.
Okay, what's really fascinating is
how it's eroded this blood vessel here.
And in fact, it leaked.
It was just the tiniest squirt of blood.
Caused your entire seizure.
It's remarkable, really.
Of course, if it happens again,
we're talking major hemorrhage.
I mean, death within minutes.
So take out the frakkin' bullet.
We need to repair that blood vessel.
Luckily, the swelling's gone down,
so I think we have a shot at this thing.
Hold on.
These memories
that I've been recovering,
- is there any chance I'll lose them?
- When you dig around in the brain,
there's always the possibility
of ancillary damage.
Then we need to hold off
until I... that circle start and...
- The words are...
- Something's obviously wrong with him.
- What is it?
- Aphasia.
It's affected his language center.
We call it "word salad".
It's not unusual.
Starbuck, this boy has a bullet
that needs to come out,
and he's asking us to wait.
If I kick this decision
over to you as the wife,
- what would you do?
- Wait, what?
No, that's not the first opening...
That's not...
That's not the random motor...
That's... Frak it. Godsdamn it.
Kara, I'm okay.
I'm fine.
Okay? I'm okay.
Please, don't take this
away from me.
I need more time, okay?
Prep for surgery.
Please. Please.
I need more time.
So much is coming back to me.
Just a little more time.
You have until they knock you out.
That's all I've got.
That's... Until they knock me out,
and as long as...
You have the words, Sam.
If I can just complete the circle,
I can get the words.
He has a remarkably clear image.
FOUR MONTHS AGO
Well, that's a nice wakeup call.
Something's happened.
They've destroyed
the resurrection hub.
Begun contemplating your mortality?
More than that.
Our extinction.
- Always so dramatic.
- It's true, Ellen.
We can't procreate biologically,
so we're going to have to find
a way to rebuild resurrection.
- Well, good luck with that.
- Don't need luck.
We need your help.
They destroyed the hub, but they don't
even know about the colony.
All your equipment is still there.
I only know
part of the system, John.
It would take all 5 of us to rebuild it,
and even then, I'm not sure...
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not, John.
Don't insult my intelligence.
Your children are dying, Ellen.
And you won't lift
a finger to save us?
Why? Out of spite?
Because I refuse
to kneel to your orthodoxy?
Now you finally see the truth
about your Final Five.
Just tell us.
- Tell us about resurrection.
- I can't. It would take all of us.
You see how she forces me.
You're no better
than the humans that enslaved us.
If you don't tell me
how to rebuild resurrection,
I'm gonna cut open your head...
And look for it there.
The brain is a marvelous thing.
It's a big electrical grid.
Just lay it open,
stimulate it at the right places,
and I can trigger
your deepest memory.
Your deepest fears.
Your deepest guilt.
And even the recipe
for life everlasting.
So Cavil was the first one we made?
John.
We treasured him.
He helped us...
build the others.
So we didn't think
this was a bad idea?
Building Cylons after we had
already seen the cycle?
The Centurions had
a single loving God.
Ellen said it changed everything.
If the Cylons embraced
love and mercy,
then the cycle
of violence could end.
Single God?
Like a one, true God?
Yeah.
- And that came from the Centurions?
- Yeah.
Cavil rejected mercy.
He had a twisted idea of morality.
So he turned on the five of us.
He trapped us in a... a thing.
The pocket.
It's a compartment.
- And then he took the O2 offline.
- He suffocated us.
- He killed us.
- Yeah.
So when we downloaded
into new bodies...
He blocked our access
to our books...
No...
Our memories...
- And implanted us with false ones.
- Yes.
Set us up, like a Boomer,
memories that we thought were real.
I guess he boxed us for a while.
Introduced Saul first,
not long after the war.
And then the gazelle.
The... the Ellen.
And back on Earth,
the warning signs...
They looked different to each one of us.
I saw a woman.
Tory, you saw a man.
Funny. No one...
No one else could see them.
- Galen, you thought...
- That's it, it's time to go.
Listen to me.
The Seven. Tell me please.
- Please tell me.
- Yes, Seven... Seven...
Seven was the Daniel.
- You sure about the word?
- Yes. He died. Daniel died.
He was Seven.
- Okay, take him.
- I'm sure. It was Daniel. I'm sure.
- We need to finish.
- Let him go.
Saul, listen to me.
Saul, stay with the fleet.
It's all starting to happen.
It's the miracle. Right here.
It's a gift from the angels.
Stay with the fleet!
Kara, make 'em stop!
I stood up for you on Demetrius!
You owe me!
Kara!
Saul?
How'd it go?
Oh, you're awake.
Where's the booze?
We haven't had any around for weeks.
Remember? The smell of it
was making me sick.
Was that weeks?
I'm glad you're back.
What did he have to say?
Cottle kicked us out.
He never got to finish.
I'm sorry.
Something new started.
He's been moving like he just
came alive tonight.
Just tonight, huh?
I don't feel anything.
Wait. He'll do it again.
You know, we should get,
like, a crib
and all the stuff that a baby...
He moved.
I felt it this time. I did.
I felt my son move.
He wants to come out and play.
That's a little dated, isn't it?
He needs a patch over his right eye.
I prefer to remember Saul
before you did that to him.
Sentimental till the end.
The Simons are prepping the OR.
You'll be impressed with the progress
we've made in memory recovery.
It might take a while.
I'm sure you'll make the procedure
as long and painful as possible.
You're mistaken
if you think I enjoy this.
Come on, John.
Of course you do.
You're a sadist.
Why not just kill us
and be done with it?
Why send us to live
among the humans?
I wanted you to see
what they're like up close and personal.
So I gave you all grandstand seats
to a holocaust.
But we didn't die.
And then you decided
that we hadn't suffered enough.
So you picked me up,
put me on a transport,
took Galen's confession,
played resistance fighter with Sam,
tortured Saul, but didn't kill him.
You had a dozen chances.
But you wanted to wait
so that when it finally happened,
when we'd download back,
we'd be ready
to admit we were wrong
and pat you on the head
for giving us the right amount
of suffering, the right amount
of punishment, all weighed out.
Then we could give you the approval
that you've always craved.
You see, you claim
to be a perfect machine,
but you are driven
by the most petty of human emotions.
Jealousy
and rage.
I know what you did to Daniel.
That seven didn't thrive.
Sad.
And it's too bad we're not made out
of something more sturdy.
Metal.
That might be nice.
Daniel was an artist.
And so sensitive to the world.
I was very close to him.
But John decided
I was playing favorites.
Maybe I was.
Someone contaminated
the amniotic fluid
in which we were maturing
all the Daniel copies.
And then corrupted
the genetic formula.
I knew it was John.
Envious.
- Sadistic.
- And who made me?
That's what we're dancing
around here, isn't it?
If I'm so irredeemable,
if I'm such a mistake,
if I'm so broken,
then whose fault is that?
It's my maker's fault.
And that's not God.
- That's you. This is on you.
- No, no, John.
God, no,
you have done terrible things.
But you are not a mistake.
If you could just accept yourself
as what you are,
as the boy I made,
you can be good.
You can be anything.
I love you, John,
because I made you.
It's okay.
It's okay, John.
- It's...
- Don't you dare!
I've gotta scrub for surgery.
I can't wait to see what perfection
looks like on the inside.
No, no, down there. Yeah.
Across the beams.
Cross, not lengthways.
Run a support there.
I know what patching
looks like, Chief.
This isn't about
those cracks, Admiral.
I started thinking
about damage that you can't see.
You know, stuff that's deeper in.
That you normally see on an x-ray.
Dealino, fire it up.
Okay, Chief. It's online.
We prepped the beam
with this liquid that fluoresces.
Now it's not an x-ray,
but you get the idea.
It's throughout the entire ship.
Hairline fractures in all the beams.
It's in her bones, Admiral.
Her bones are rotten.
I have an idea. There's something
on the baseship that can help.
Cylon technology?
It's this organic resin.
It'll grow into the metal.
Make it stronger.
It'll take the load as it matures.
As it matures?
It's biological.
Out of the question, Chief.
All due respect, Admiral.
You asked me to do this job.
- What's your life worth to you?
- No.
I'm sorry.
I'm so very sorry.
I was greedy.
I kept you too long.
I thought maybe I was the seven.
I need to be something.
I'll be here as soon as you wake up.
And I'll give you
all the time that you want.
We'll learn all the secrets, okay?
Okay, here we go.
All right, Kara,
time for you to leave.
Here we go.
- Thank you.
- Let's go. Retractor.
Thank you.
How do you stand it?
Knowing that he hates you
for the things you've done?
Maybe he doesn't.
Love's like that sometimes.
The Simons are ready for the surgery.
They'd like you to put this on.
A prop to legitimize John's
final bit of theatre. No, thank you.
You should have brought a tumbrel.
Never mind.
Let's get this over with.
Still in there?
Doc said, like, two hours.
Been in there a lot longer than that.
We only needed a little more.
I wanted to ask him
about that frakking song.
- Ask him when he gets out.
- Starbuck,
I got something for ya.
There's your bullet.
Doc plucked it outta there
and repaired the artery.
He's gonna live.
When's he gonna wake up?
I'm actually surprised
he's not awake by now.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
His brain is repairing itself.
We're hooking up an EEG,
and gonna see what's going on.
Go ahead.
Boomer,
have you really thought about this?
I have.
You're gonna regret
your part in this.
I'm sure I will.
- What are you doing?
- Forgiving you.
Hey, Sam.
You're gonna be okay.
You got a room
full of rabid Cylon-types
that can't wait to hear
the next chapter of their life story.
I think they're hoping
for a musical.
So you better hurry up
and get better.
They're starting
to look a little mean.
- Don't bother.
- Excuse me?
There's almost no brain activity.
He doesn't hear you.
He's not in there.
Give me the chief.
This is the chief.
Chief...
Do whatever you have to do
to save our girl.
Yes, sir.
{\<i>Précédemment dans</i>
Battlestar Galactica...}
Je pense aux dommages invisibles.
Des fissures
dans toutes les poutres.
Tout le vaisseau est comme ça.
C'est notre enfant.
Nous pensions que le manque de foi
nous empêchait
de nous reproduire biologiquement.
Et de notre amour un enfant est né.
- Emmenez-le.
- Saul, écoute. Reste avec la flotte.
Le miracle ne fait que commencer.
Reste avec la flotte !
Ellen, tu es le Cinquième.
- Que fais-tu ?
- Je te pardonne.
- Ça va marcher ?
- Aucune idée, monsieur.
C'est ça ?
Oui.
- Je peux le toucher ?
- Oui.
C'est gluant.
Mais ça durcit.
Ça fait comme du cartilage.
C'est souple et résistant.
Le vaisseau-mère en est fait.
C'est vivant ?
Attention.
Attention, marines. Reculez.
Reculez et tout le monde
aura sa part.
Reculez !
Y en aura pour tous. Reculez !
- Je ne veux pas d'ennuis.
- Eh bien, tu en as.
Ça a intérêt à marcher.
Son coeur bat comme un métronome.
Allez, sortez d'ici.
Faites de la place aux malades.
Tu devrais passer la nuit ici.
J'ai pas confiance en cette machine.
Je sais.
Ironique, non ?
Le bébé va bien.
Liam va bien.
Je dormirai mieux chez nous
avec toi.
- Rapport de situation ?
- On a un contact dradis.
Un Raptor. Identifiant colonial,
mais il n'est pas sur le registre.
C'est un des nôtres,
mais disparu depuis plus d'un an.
<i>Demande permission d'aborder.</i>
Raptor 702,
votre transmission est mauvaise.
Si vous m'entendez,
allumez vos feux.
Reçu, 702. Galactica,
<i>ils nous reçoivent.</i>
Red leader, ici Red Turkey :
je pense que c'est une Huit.
Starbuck, ici le Galactica.
- <i>Au rapport.</i>
- Galactica, ici Red leader.
Notre ami le raider lourd
dit qu'il s'agit d'une Sharon.
Une Huit.
Starbuck, escortez-la.
<i>Bien reçu.</i>
Par les Dieux.
Ellen Tigh.
Bill.
Combien de mortes il reste ?
Je suis très heureuse de vous voir.
Personne pour aider une dame
à descendre de ce truc ?
Heureux de te revoir.
C'est Boomer.
Marines.
Emmenez cette Huit en cellule.

Saison 4 - Épisode 16
39 556 SURVIVANTS
À LA RECHERCHE D'UN FOYER
Sous-titres
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-
Il veut recréer la résurrection.
Il veut que nous,
nous le fassions.
Je pense que Cavil
est complètement déséquilibré.
C'est trop pour lui. L'idée que...
Que le seul horizon des Cylons
soit cette quête désespérée
de la procréation, de l'évolution,
tous ces tâtonnements biologiques.
Pardon,
je vous ai perdus en route, non ?
Je reste Ellen, vous savez ?
Vous auriez quelque chose à boire ?
Peut-être une flasque ?
Boomer vous a aidée à fuir.
Oui.
Ne soyez pas trop dur avec elle.
Ne vous occupez pas de ça.
Je peux les voir ?
Les autres ?
Galen, Tory et Sam ?
Imaginez,
Bill, Laura, imaginez...
Au lieu de...
50 000 survivants,
cinq seulement.
Cinq personnes.
Imaginez à quel point
vous seriez proches.
Et d'un coup, tout ça disparaît.
Ça va aller, Ellen.
C'est fini, maintenant.
Tu te souviens ?
Par bribes.
Des flashes.
Samuel Anders
est dans un état critique.
Il est dans le coma.
- Mon Dieu.
- Il est vivant.
- Il y a encore de l'espoir.
- Je veux le voir.
Lui et les autres.
On va y réfléchir.
J'arrive pas à croire
que tu sois là.
J'ai tant à te demander.
J'ai tant à...
Il faut que je te dise...
Fais vite.
Ellen, attends.
- Le sol ou la table ?
- Je m'en fous.
- Gaius !
- Jeanne.
- Bienvenue.
- Tu m'as manqué. Laisse-moi te voir.
Paulla.
On se demandait si tu reviendrais.
Si ?
Bien sûr que j'allais revenir !
Évidemment.
Alors,
j'ai raté quoi ?
Que s'est-il passé ?
Ça a mal tourné après ton départ.
On a eu des vivres
et des hommes les ont pris.
De force.
Ça a été...
On était épuisées, Gaius.
On a compris
qu'on avait été abandonnées
et qu'il fallait
se prendre en charge.
Abandonnées ?
Comment peux-tu...
- Je ne dirais pas ça. Je dirais...
- Abandonnées par Dieu.
Voilà, voilà ce que je dirais.
Il y avait des morts armés
dans le couloir.
On a pris leurs armes.
Maintenant on peut se défendre
et protéger notre nourriture.
Tout ça...
Ce ne sont que des vivres.
On est autonomes, à présent.
Je savais que vous trouveriez
la force en mon absence.
Et vous l'avez trouvée.
C'est une des raisons qui m'ont poussé
à vous laisser si longtemps.
Très sage de ta part, Gaius.
Les brebis ont un nouveau berger.
Voilà un accueil digne de ce nom.
Très impressionnant.
Qui as-tu sauté ?
- Quoi ?
- Arrête.
Après des milliers d'années de mariage,
je connais ton répertoire, tu sais ?
Je ne t'en veux pas.
Tu me croyais morte.
- Ellen.
- Qui était-ce ?
Si tu veux vraiment...
C'était une Six.
Caprica Six.
On a fabriqué les Six.
- On l'a créée. C'est simplement...
- Je pensais à toi.
Sans arrêt.
- Je pensais à toi.
- Quoi ? Quand vous...
Je t'en prie, ne me dis pas
que tu fantasmais sur moi.
C'est pitoyable.
- Tu la vois toujours ?
- Oui.
Beaucoup de visiteurs.
Que personne ne débranche rien.
Mon Dieu.
- Je ne pensais pas voir ça un jour.
- Si,
c'était comme ça.
Tory.
Galen.
Toutes ces années.
Le pauvre garçon.
Quel mauvais timing.
Nous avons réfléchi.
Nous devons être ensemble.
Venez avec nous.
Nous partirons
vers une nouvelle vie.
Pensez à notre offre.
C'est important, pour nous.
Abandonner la flotte.
C'est ça, votre offre ?
La priorité de la flotte
est la survie...
La survie des humains.
Nous ne sommes pas en sécurité.
- Aujourd'hui, un Cylon a été agressé.
- Je suis d'accord.
On parle de la survie de la 13e tribu
sous sa forme la plus pure.
C'est ton idée ?
Mais ça ne marchera pas.
Hera est l'espoir
d'un nouvel avenir mixte.
C'était vrai, avant.
Maintenant, il y a une alternative.
Le bébé de Caprica Six
est un Cylon pur.
Nous pouvons reconstruire
une civilisation cylon pure.
Même sans trouver de planète,
on peut vivre indéfiniment
sur le vaisseau-mère.
Regardez-le.
Il mourrait, là-bas.
On peut s'occuper de lui.
Mieux qu'ici.
La famille cylon peut survivre.
On peut recommencer à zéro.
Caprica Six
est enceinte ?
- Tu l'as mise enceinte ?
- Oui.
Je le savais pas.
- J'ai été surpris.
- Nous avons tous été très surpris.
La conception d'un Cylon.
Vous êtes nos enfants.
On peut parler de l'offre
et s'occuper du bébé plus tard ?
On s'en va ou...
Bien sûr que non.
Anders nous a bien dit
de ne pas abandonner la flotte.
- Alors, tu l'aimes.
- C'est ses derniers mots.
Là, il ne dit plus rien.
Je rejoins le vaisseau-mère.
Même après l'avoir appris...
- Bon sang...
- Tu nous salis.
Tu ne peux pas t'empêcher
de m'empoisonner.
Encore et toujours plus de poison
jusqu'à ce que je nage dedans !
- Arrêtez.
- Je reste. Compris ?
- Va-t'en, si tu es si en colère.
- Attends.
On ne partira pas
qu'avec un ou deux Cinq.
C'est tout le monde ou personne.
Vous devez voter.
Et vous suivrez le résultat.
À la majorité.
C'est la méthode cylon.
- Un héritage que nous tenons de vous.
- Très bien. On vote ?
Très bien. Je vote pour partir.
Parfait, ça fait deux.
On sait pas ce que voterait Anders.
Si, il a dit qu'il resterait.
Toutes ces années
où on voulait un enfant,
sans succès.
Tu as bien dû te marrer.
C'était impossible.
Tu ne m'aimais pas.
Qu'est-ce que tu en dis ?
On reste ou on s'en va ?
Je n'ai pas décidé.
Deux pour, deux contre.
Et le vote décisif s'en va.
On vient souvent à Clebsville,
maintenant.
On ne ressent plus le besoin
de se couper du reste du monde.
On commerce,
on vend les bijoux qu'on fabrique.
D'où notre nourriture.
Oui, Jeanne.
Depuis votre départ, on a essayé
de se concentrer sur la vie.
Gaius, viens.
Quel est votre nom ?
Naia.
C'est un très joli nom.
Qui est-ce ?
Lève-toi.
Voici Gaius.
Vraiment ? Je suis flatté...
- C'était le nom de son père.
- ... de porter le nom de son père.
C'est très...
Tu as faim ?
Tu en as l'air.
Il a faim ?
Ils ont tous faim.
Paulla, nous avons de la nourriture
à partager avec ces gens, non ?
On en a besoin,
pour manger ou faire du troc.
Impossible.
Vraiment, Paulla.
Allons-nous apprécier
cette nourriture
si des enfants meurent de faim ?
Pose-toi cette question.
Regarde autour de toi.
Ce n'est pas que ce garçon.
Ce...
petit Gaius.
Mais il est très mignon.
C'est tous les enfants. Tous.
Et tu leur retires la nourriture...
Écoutez-moi !
Je reviendrai.
Et même si c'est mon dernier geste,
je m'assurerai
que chacun d'entre vous soit nourri
et que vos enfants soient nourris,
que Dieu m'en soit témoin !
Caprica.
C'est drôle. C'est la première fois
que je vous donne un nom.
Autre qu'un nom d'oiseau.
Je n'ai pas eu la chance...
Plutôt, je n'ai pas pris le temps
de vous féliciter, pour le bébé.
Je me demandais si tout allait bien,
avec le retour d'Ellen.
J'ai entendu parler
de l'agression à Clebsville.
Et, au nom de la flotte,
j'aimerais vous présenter mes excuses.
Merci.
C'est très gentil de votre part.
Caprica, il m'arrive de penser
aux visions que nous avons partagées
et à...
notre conversation.
Ça fait longtemps que j'en ai pas eu.
Et vous ?
Pas depuis ma grossesse.
Je n'y avais jamais songé.
Voulez-vous dire que cet enfant...
Quoi ?
Est-ce que cet enfant
est important ?
Je pense qu'il est très important.
C'est mon bébé, je l'aime.
Il est très important à mes yeux.
Bien sûr que oui.
Tous les enfants sont importants.
Tout à fait.
Merci d'avoir pris des nouvelles.
Je vous en prie.
Depuis quand t'as un piano ?
Un gin.
T'as vu Ellen et Tigh
sur l'aile du Raptor ?
J'ai cru voir mes parents
faire l'amour.
T'es allé voir Boomer en cellule ?
Va la voir quand elle dort.
J'ai veillé Sam
jusqu'à ce que ça m'amuse plus.
Te voilà.
Regarde-toi.
Tu n'as pas beaucoup changé.
Comment as-tu fait
pour que les gardes t'amènent ici ?
On pourrait prendre un verre ?
Où est la gnôle ?
- J'ai du thé.
- Mon Dieu, non.
Je voulais te parler.
Entre Saul et moi,
c'était fou.
Je descends de ce Raptor
et boum, on fait l'amour.
Et moins d'un jour plus tard,
je l'engueule.
On a toujours,
toujours fait ça.
Bref, je voulais juste...
te rassurer.
Il ne t'a pas parlé du sexe.
Frak.
Je suis...
J'essaie d'être gentille...
Écoute.
Ne t'inquiète pas.
Vraiment.
Tu as toutes les preuves
qu'il t'aime.
On a toujours essayé d'en avoir un.
Il voulait l'appeler Liam.
Un bébé cylon pur.
Si Simon le savait,
il voudrait vraiment l'avoir.
Je m'occuperai de cet enfant.
Ce n'était pas une menace, Caprica.
Si.
C'était une menace.
J'ignore pourquoi
vous n'avez pas eu d'enfant.
L'amour ne doit pas suffire,
parce qu'il vous aimait.
C'est...
C'est rude.
Mais qu'y puis-je ?
Si je lui demande de choisir
entre toi et moi,
le mieux que je puisse espérer,
c'est qu'il se partage en deux.
Ne faites pas ça.
Je ne le ferai pas.
Tu as gagné.
Il t'aime.
Je dirais même
qu'il t'aime plus que tout.
Tiens, Gaius. Voilà pour toi.
Tiens, donne ça à maman.
Tenez.
Les marines ont déjà essayé.
Les gens se sont bousculés.
Les marines ont des fusils d'assaut,
pas des pistolets.
Regarde autour de toi, Paulla.
Tu vois des émeutes ?
Non.
- Il n'y a pas d'uniformes.
- Venez.
Personne ne se sent opprimé.
Il n'y a que de l'entraide.
On a besoin de la nourriture.
Quand tu partages,
Dieu te le rend au centuple.
Regarde-moi et apprends.
Écartez-vous de là.
Vraiment ?
Qui êtes-vous ?
Écartez-vous de la nourriture.
Mesdames,
montrez-lui que nous sommes armés.
Allez.
Enlève la sécurité, Jeanne.
Les nôtres sont plus gros.
Attention.
Vous cinq, enfin réunis.
Tu as eu...
des révélations mythiques ?
Non. Rien à signaler, Amiral.
- Tu es bien né, Saul ?
- Quoi ?
Tu es né.
Sur Terre. Oui.
Je me souviens pas.
Mais...
Je m'en souviendrais pas
de toute façon.
C'est la nature du processus, hein ?
Ça fait pas très machine.
Mon arrière grand-père
était une ponceuse.
Ils sont en train
de lui mettre ce truc.
- La gélatine cylon dont tu parlais.
- Oui.
Si ça marche,
ça sera toujours le Galactica
en apparence, mais...
il y perdra son identité.
Ça va le sauver.
Ça et les patrouilles cylons.
On a besoin d'eux.
J'ai besoin de toi.
Laura et Lee le savent.
Ils pensent que je ne le vois pas.
Mais si.
Je le vois.
Je savais pas que les Fils d'Aries
étaient impliqués.
Bien sûr que si.
Tu crois qu'ils allaient laisser passer
quelque chose d'aussi précieux.
Tu ne veux plus
être le roi des fous.
Non, une seule chose est pire
que d'en être le chef.
C'est d'en faire partie.
Tu voulais vraiment leur donner
de quoi se nourrir ?
Ça m'a plu, en fait.
J'ai pris plaisir...
à donner.
J'ai aimé ça, à vrai dire.
Plus je le faisais...
Un peu plus
et je leur aurais donné mon coeur.
Tu penses qu'elle...
leur dit quelque chose
d'aussi émouvant ?
Qu'elle leur donne de l'espoir ?
Non.
Qu'est-ce que Paulla vous raconte ?
Dit-elle que l'on ne doit pas
aider les autres ?
Parce que...
je ne suis pas d'accord.
Dit-elle qu'on ne peut pas
aider les autres
parce qu'on est trop faibles ?
Je ne suis pas d'accord.
Tu me déçois tellement.
Vous me décevez tous.
Regardez-vous.
Je pars trois minutes
et vous vous délectez
du pragmatisme glacial de Paulla.
Il est possible
d'avoir de quoi nous nourrir,
et ceux de Clebsville avec.
Il est possible d'apporter l'espoir
aux ponts inférieurs,
à l'ensemble de ce pauvre vaisseau.
Il est possible de gagner.
- Elle pense qu'on n'a pas les moyens.
- Elle pense
qu'on n'a pas les moyens.
Nous n'avons besoin que de force.
Nous n'avons besoin que de force.
Et la force
vient de nous.
On peut avoir plus d'armes.
Des plus grosses.
Et des armes !
Plus d'armes.
Des armes plus grosses, meilleures.
Et quand on les aura, on vaincra !
Merci de m'accorder un instant.
Je voulais...
- Je dois te parler.
- Bien sûr.
Déteste-moi si tu veux,
je l'encaisserai.
Mais tu dois faire abstraction.
Le Galactica a besoin du vaisseau-mère.
Pourquoi avoir fait
l'amour avec moi, Saul,
alors que tu en aimes une autre ?
Tu m'as écouté, au moins ?
Bill a besoin du vaisseau-mère.
J'ai entendu.
Et toi, tu m'as écoutée ?
Sa brosse est à la place
de la mienne.
Mes robes ont disparu.
Elle couche dans notre lit.
Dans le matelas que j'ai acheté.
T'es allée dans mes quartiers ?
Je dérange ?
Pas du tout. Je t'attendais.
Tu l'as fait venir ?
Parfait. Entrez.
- Toi aussi, Caprica.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
On part sur le vaisseau-mère.
Tous.
- On sautera dès que vous serez prêts.
- Merci.
- C'est la bonne décision.
- Non. Pas du tout.
C'est toi et Anders,
contre moi, Tory
et Galen.
Évidemment, ça veut dire
que tu viens aussi, Caprica.
Tu veux élever ton enfant
en lieu sûr, non ?
Évidemment, oui.
Elle ne comprend pas les enjeux.
Je pensais qu'Hera
était notre seul espoir.
Manifestement, ce n'est plus le cas.
Son bébé est 100 % cylon.
Partir pour créer
une civilisation uniquement cylon,
c'est ce qui s'est passé sur Terre
et ça a mené au désastre.
100 % humain, ça ne marche pas.
100 % cylon, non plus.
C'est trop fragile.
Tu refuses de quitter
ton véritable amour.
Quoi ?
- Explique-moi ?
- C'est bas et mesquin.
Ça suffit. On a voté.
On part quand ?
On peut être prêts dans l'heure.
- Je reste.
- On a voté à la majorité.
On aurait inventé
la règle de la majorité.
Mais je m'en souviens pas.
Alors merde.
Saul, ne la laisse pas...
D'accord. Partez.
Vous tous.
Caprica. Vas-y.
Restez purs, en sécurité
et que sais-je encore.
- Je ne viens pas.
- Tu vois, petite fille ?
Il y a une chose dans l'univers
qu'il aime bien plus que toi
ou moi.
C'est Bill Adama.
Tu veux même pas partir.
C'est pour te venger.
- Bill Adama, le vaisseau et l'uniforme.
- Comment tu peux tomber si bas ?
- Le reste passe après.
- Pourquoi tu fais ça ?
Je le savais, mais je me suis toujours
demandé si un bébé te changerait.
Maintenant, je sais.
C'est pas normal...
Appelez Cottle.
Ça va aller.
J'ai jamais vu
un cas s'aggraver aussi vite,
mais il se bat,
c'est tout ce que je peux dire.
- Je le pensais pas.
- Bien sûr que si.
Tenez,
ça stimulera son rythme cardiaque.
Tu savais quel serait mon choix
et ce que ça signifiait.
Je suis désolée.
Bien sûr, Cylons et humains
doivent rester ensemble.
J'ai toujours eu l'intention de...
J'ai pas réfléchi.
Saul, je voulais te blesser,
- pas elle.
- Tu t'es pas dit que ça la blesserait,
si je la quittais.
Ça t'es pas venu à l'esprit ?
Pas étonnant qu'on ait dû
leur inventer un Dieu.
On a pas réussi à faire
qu'ils nous vénèrent.
- On a rien inventé.
- Arrêtez.
Je suis désolée.
Peut-être...
que je devrais partir.
Première remarque intelligente.
Parle-lui.
Dis-lui que tu l'aimes.
Elle en a besoin.
Et le bébé aussi.
Écoute.
Je t'aime,
compris ?
Tu m'entends ?
C'est absurde. Elle le sait.
Je devrais pas avoir à le dire,
ça suffit pas de le ressentir ?
- Dis-lui.
- Je le ressens.
Pour elle, pour toi, pour Liam.
Je devrais pas avoir à dire les mots.
C'est moins fort avec des mots.
Laisse-moi le ressentir,
et je vais remplir
cette putain de pièce.
Le rythme cardiaque faiblit.
Les signaux sont au rouge. C'est grave.
Je suis désolé.
Sortez-le.
Même si je dois en mourir.
Il vivra, si vous le faites vite.
Les bébés cylons sont forts, non ?
Hera était prématurée.
Sortez-le.
Hors de question, oubliez.
Il n'y survivra pas. Quatre mois ?
- Non.
- Je vous en prie.
Caprica, écoute,
je dois te le dire.
Il t'aime plus
qu'il ne m'a jamais aimée.
Tu es la mère de son fils.
Le bébé est en vie. Je vois
son coeur battre sur le moniteur.
C'est la preuve.
La preuve qu'il t'aime.
Très fort.
Il en rayonne.
Vous pouvez rester tous les deux
sur le Galactica.
Je partirai avec les autres.
Vous serez ensemble.
Une petite famille.
C'est promis.
C'est terminé. Condoléances.
Non, c'était moi.
C'est de ma faute.
Je suis désolé.
Nous avons du travail.
Il est temps de partir.
Laissez-nous. Infirmière !
Dehors.
Ils s'en occuperont bien.
Restez si vous voulez,
pour écouter ça.
- Où vas-tu ?
- À la proue.
Faire quelque chose de constructif.
Un projet en cours.
Écoutez-moi, amiral.
Attends.
Expliquez-vous.
Vous avez des civils affamés
sur les bras,
sans représentants, sans recours.
Ils sont à bout.
Ils sont épuisés. Ils en ont marre.
Ce ne sera pas une mutinerie.
- Mais une révolution.
- Vous pouvez régler ça ?
Écoutez-moi.
Je vous en prie, amiral !
Le Galactica vous échappe peu à peu.
Vous faites couler du sang cylon
dans ses veines.
On a tous vu les pilotes cylons.
Et leurs équipes de travail.
Que viennent-ils faire
sur ce vaisseau ?
Quand allez-vous inviter des Centurions
à cette petite sauterie ?
Quand vous en serez là,
à ce moment précis,
vous aurez un vaisseau hybride.
À demi-humain seulement.
Je suis venu vous dire
que votre peuple...
Votre peuple n'est pas prêt pour ça.
Écoutez-moi, amiral.
Je vous offre
la dernière alternative humaine
que vous aurez jamais.
Tu as réussi.
Je sais pas comment,
mais c'est fait.
Je te l'avais dit, Paulla.
Les bonnes actions
sont toujours récompensées.
Récompensées au centuple.
Si vous donnez...
vous recevez en retour.
C'était magnifique.
Condoléances.
Liam.
Il s'appelait Liam.
C'est un beau prénom.
- Le diminutif de William.
- Ouais.
C'est pas comme ça. Je le sais.
Je sais.
Ça va aller.
Ce sont les Cylons décédés
depuis l'alliance.
Je ne savais pas qu'ils faisaient ça.
Et toi ?
Ceci est déjà arrivé, n'est-ce pas ?
<i>{\Previously on </i>
Battlestar Galactica...}
I started thinking
about damages you can't see.
Hairline fractures in all the beams.
It's throughout the entire ship.
It's our baby, Saul.
We'd come to believe
that a lack of God's love
is what prevented us
from biological reproduction.
And our love produced a child.
- Let him go now. Take him now.
- Saul, stay with the fleet.
It's all starting to happen,
it's the miracle right here.
Stay with the fleet!
Ellen, you're the Fifth.
- What are you doing?
- Forgiving you.
- Is this gonna work?
- I have no idea, sir.
This is the stuff?
Yeah.
- Can I touch it?
- Yeah.
It's gooey.
But it... hardens.
Becomes like cartilage.
It's flexible, strong.
It's what the baseship's made of.
Is this alive?
Heads up.
Heads up, marines.
Stay back.
Stay back and everyone
will get their share!
Stay back!
Everyone'll get their share.
Hey, Cylon.
- I don't want any trouble.
- Well, you got trouble.
This better work.
Kid's got a heart
like a kettle drum.
Go on, get out of here.
Make room for some sick people.
You should stay here for the night.
I don't trust that machine.
I know.
The irony is irresistible.
The baby's fine.
Liam is fine.
You know I'd sleep better at home
with you.
Sitrep.
Sir, we're picking up
a bogey on dradis.
Raptor. Squawks colonial,
but it's not on the roster.
It's one of ours, but we logged it
as lost over a year ago, sir.
<i>Galactica, permission to board.</i>
Raptor 702,
your transmission's all garbled.
If you can hear me, give me a flash.
Copy, 702. Galactica,
<i>they're receiving.</i>
Red leader, Red Turkey, the voice.
I think that's an Eight.
Starbuck, Galactica actual.
- <i>Report.</i>
- Galactica, Red leader.
Our heavy raider buddy's
calling the inbound a "Sharon".
An Eight.
Starbuck, bring it in.
<i>Copy that.</i>
My Gods.
It's Ellen Tigh.
Bill.
How many dead chicks are out there?
I can't tell you
how happy I am to see you.
Aren't you gonna help a lady
down off this thing?
Nice to see you again.
This is Boomer.
Marines.
Take this number Eight to the brig.

He wants to rebuild resurrection.
He wants us
to rebuild it.
I really think Cavil's
completely unbalanced.
It's too much for him,
the thought that the...
The only hope for the Cylon people
is this desperate grab
for procreation, evolution,
all that messy biological
trial and error.
Dear.
I'm totally throwing you, aren't I?
I'm still Ellen, you know.
Does anyone have something to drink?
Maybe a flask?
So Boomer helped you escape.
Yes. I hope
you won't treat her too badly.
You don't need
to worry about Boomer.
May I see them?
The others?
Galen, Tory, and Sam?
Imagine,
Bill, Laura, imagine...
instead of...
50,000 survivors,
there are only five.
Five people.
Imagine how close you'd be.
And then to have all that torn away.
It's all right, Ellen.
It's over now.
How much do you remember?
Not much from before.
Flashes.
Samuel Anders was badly injured.
He's not responding.
- My God.
- He's not dead.
- There's hope.
- I want to see him.
I want to see him and the others.
We'll see what we can do.
I can't believe
you're here.
There is so much I have to ask you.
There's so...
I have to tell you.
You'd better say it fast.
Ellen, wait.
- Floor or table?
- I don't care.
Gaius!
Jeanne.
- Welcome back.
- I missed you. Let me look at you.
Paulla.
We were wondering
if you were coming back.
If?
Of course I was coming back!
Course I was.
So.
What did I miss?
What's been going on?
Well, it got pretty bad
after you left, Gaius.
They'd bring us supplies and men
would come and take them away by force.
It was...
We were very tired, Gaius.
We realized we'd been abandoned
and we had
to take care of ourselves.
Abandoned?
I... How could you...
- I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't say...
- Abandoned by God.
That I might. I might say that.
There were dead men in the halls
with guns in their hands.
So we took their guns.
Now we can protect our food
and we can protect ourselves.
All of this...
All of this is food, Gaius.
We're taking care of ourselves now.
I knew if I stayed away
that you'd find the strength.
And you have.
It's one of the reasons
why I stayed away as long as I did.
That was wise of you, Gaius.
Sheep have a new shepherd, Gaius.
That's what I call a big welcome.
Very impressive.
So who'd you frak?
What?
Come on.
You don't think I know your repertoire
after thousands of years of marriage?
It's okay. I'm not mad.
You thought I was dead.
- Ellen.
- Who was it?
Well, if you really...
It was a Six.
Caprica-Six.
We made Sixes.
- We created her. That's just...
- I thought of you.
Always.
- I thought of you.
- What do you mean? When you...
Please do not tell me
I was your mental porn.
That's just sad.
- Well, are you still seeing her?
- Yes.
Lot of visitors.
Just don't anybody unplug anything.
Oh, my.
I never thought I would see this.
Yes,
this is how it was.
Tory.
Galen.
All those years.
The poor boy.
Such bad timing.
We've been thinking.
We belong together.
Join us on the baseship.
We'll jump away. Start a new life.
Please consider the offer.
It would mean so much to us.
Abandon the fleet.
This is your offer?
The priority of the fleet
is the survival...
The survival of humans.
We're not safe in this fleet.
- Even today a Cylon was assaulted.
- I agree.
This is about the survival
of the original 13th tribe
in its purest form.
Did you put this idea
in their heads?
It won't work, of course.
The child, Hera, is the hope
for a new blended future.
That used to be true.
But now there's another way.
Caprica-Six's unborn baby
is pure Cylon.
We can rebuild
a pure Cylon civilization.
Even if we don't find
a planet to colonize,
we can live indefinitely
on the baseship.
Look at him.
He'd die over there.
We can take care of him
better than here.
The Cylon family can survive.
We can start over.
Caprica-Six
is pregnant?
- You got her pregnant?
- I... I did. Yeah.
I didn't know.
- I was surprised.
- It was a great surprise to all of us.
The mating of an original Cylon.
You are our children.
Can we talk about the offer,
maybe deal with the baby later?
Are we going or...?
Of course not.
Anders specifically said
"Do not abandon the fleet."
- So you love her then.
- Last thing he ever said.
He's not saying anything now.
I'm going with the baseship.
Even after you knew...
- For frak's sake.
- You made us all filthy in this.
You just can't stop poisoning me.
Poison more and more of it
until I'm swimming in it!
- Stop this.
- I'm staying on Galactica. You hear me?
- You can go if you're so mad.
- Wait.
We won't leave
with just one or two of the Five.
It has to be all of you
or none of you.
So you need to vote
and the outcome will bind all of you.
Majority rule.
It's what Cylons do.
It's a legacy from you.
Fine. So it's a vote?
All right. I vote we go.
Great. That's me and you.
We don't really know
what Anders would vote.
Yeah, we do. He said he'd stay.
All those years
we tried to have children
and we never could.
You must've been laughing
your shiny, shiny head off.
It was impossible.
You didn't love me.
So what are you saying?
Do you vote to stay or to go?
I haven't decided yet.
Two to go. Two to stay.
And the swing vote
is walking out the door.
We come to Dogsville more often now.
We don't feel the need to cut ourselves
off from the rest of the world.
We trade here. Sometimes,
we sell the jewelry that we made.
That's how we got so much food.
Yes, Jeanne.
Since you've been gone,
we've been trying to focus on life.
Gaius, come on.
Hello.
What's your name?
Naia.
Naia.
That's a very beautiful name.
And who's this?
Stand up.
Stand up.
This is Gaius.
Really? I'm very flattered...
It was his father's name.
To have the same name as his father.
It's very...
Are you hungry?
You look a bit hungry.
He's hungry?
- They're all hungry.
- Are they?
Paulla, we've got some food,
haven't we?
To share with this lot of people?
We're gonna need it eventually
to eat, to trade.
We can't.
Really, Paulla.
Are we going to enjoy this food
with children starving?
Now ask yourself
this question really.
Look aroun, look at these childr...
It's not just this child here.
This...
Little Gaius.
But he is very cute, this one.
It's all the children, isn't it?
All of them.
And you're putting the food...
Listen to me!
Listen to me!
I'm coming back here.
And if it is the last thing I do,
I will ensure
that every single one of you are fed
and your children are fed,
as God is my witness!
Caprica.
That's funny. I don't think
I've ever called you a name before.
I think you probably called me
some names.
I haven't had the chan...
No, I haven't taken the opportunity
to congratulate you and the baby.
I just wondered if everything
was all right with Ellen being back.
I heard about the assault
in Dogsville.
And on behalf of the fleet,
I wanted to apologize to you.
Thank you.
It's very kind of you.
Caprica, sometimes
I think about the visions
that we shared and the talk...
we had.
I haven't had one in a while.
Have you?
Not the whole time
I've been pregnant.
That never occurred to me.
Are you saying that this ch...
What?
Is this child important?
Yes, I think he's very important.
He's my baby and I love him.
He's very important to me.
Of course he is.
Of course, all children are important.
Yes. Indeed.
Thank you for asking about him.
You're welcome.
When'd you get a piano?
Gin.
You see Ellen and Tigh
on the wing of that bird?
It's like watching
my parents make out.
You go see Boomer in the brig yet?
No.
You should go when she's asleep.
I watched Sam until I just
couldn't handle the fun anymore.
There you are.
Look at you.
You haven't changed much.
How did you get the guards
to bring you here?
I thought maybe we could have a drink.
Where's the booze?
- I have tea.
- God no.
Listen, I wanted to talk to you.
Things between me and Saul
just got so crazy.
I step off that Raptor and boom,
we're making love.
And
less than a day later, I'm...
I'm screaming at him.
But we were always, always,
always like that.
Anyway, I just...
I wanted to assure you.
He didn't tell you about the sex.
Frak.
I'm...
I come here to try to be good and...
Look.
Don't worry.
Seriously. Because
you have all the proof right there
that he loves you.
You know, when we were still trying
to have our own,
he always brought up
the name "Liam".
Pure Cylon baby.
If Simon knew,
he'd want it so badly.
I'll take care of this child.
That wasn't a threat, Caprica.
No.
It was a threat.
I don't know why
you couldn't have children, Ellen.
Sometimes love must
not be enough because he loved you.
Yes, this...
This is rough.
But what can I do?
If I make him choose
between you and me,
I know the best I could do
would be to tear him in half.
Don't.
I won't.
You win.
The man loves you.
In fact, I'd say there isn't much
he loves more.
Here you go, Gaius. Here you go.
Here you go. Take that to mommy.
Here you go. There you go.
The marines tried this already, Gaius,
and people started pushing and grabbing.
The marines have assault rifles,
not handguns.
Look around you, Paulla, will you?
Look around.
Can you see anybody rioting?
Can you? No.
- There's no uniforms here.
- Come, come.
There's no sense of oppression.
It's just...
It's just one soul touching another,
isn't it?
Well, we need the food.
Paulla, when you share your food,
God makes it tenfold.
You watch me.
You're going to learn something.
You're gonna want
to step away from those.
Really?
And who will you be?
Step away from the supplies.
Ladies,
show this man we are armed.
Do it.
Take it off the safety, Jeanne.
Ours are bigger.
Careful...
So the five of you together at last.
Any...
mythic revelations?
Nope. Nothing to report, sir.
- You were born, right, Saul?
- What?
You were born.
On Earth. Yeah.
I don't remember.
But...
I wouldn't anyway.
Nature of the process, right?
Not very machine-like of you.
Great grandpa was a power sander.
They're puttin' the stuff into her.
- The Cylon goop you said.
- Yeah.
If it works,
she'll still be the Galactica
on the outside, but...
She won't know what she is anymore.
It'll save her.
That along with Cylons flying cap.
We need their help.
I need your help.
Laura and Lee know it.
They don't think I see it.
But I do.
I see it.
You never told me that the Sons of Aries
were involved in this.
Of course they are, Gai.
Did you think they would stay
out of something
as valuable as food supplies?
Well, you didn't want to be
king of the fools anymore.
No, the only thing worse
than being leader of this lot...
would be being one of them.
Did you really want to feed
those people?
I enjoyed it, actually. I did enjoy
giving.
I loved it, actually.
The more I did it...
Done it long enough,
I'd have given them my heart.
Well, do you think she's...
telling them anything as moving as that?
Do you think she's giving them hope?
She's not, is she?
What's Paulla been saying to you?
Has Paulla been saying
that we mustn't help others?
Because...
I disagree.
Has Paulla been saying
that we can't
help others because we're too weak?
I disagree.
Oh, Paulla.
I am so disappointed with you.
I'm disappointed with all of you.
Here you all are.
I'm gone for three minutes
and you're lapping up Paulla's
icy pragmatism.
There is a way to feed ourselves
and the people from Dogsville!
There is a way to bring hope
to the lower decks.
To the whole of this poor ship.
There is a way to win!
She thinks
we can't get what we need.
She thinks
we can't get what we need.
All we need is strength.
All we need is strength!
And strength
comes from within.
We can get more guns.
Better guns. Bigger guns.
And guns!
More guns. Bigger guns.
Better guns.
And when we have those,
we will win!
Thanks for seeing me alone.
I just...
- I have to talk to you.
- Of course.
Hate me, i'll take it.
But this is bigger than that.
Galactica needs the baseship.
Why did you even
make love to me, Saul,
when your real love was at home?
Did you even hear what I said?
Bill needs the baseship.
I heard you.
Did you hear me?
Her brush is where mine used to be.
My dresses are gone.
She shares our bed.
Do you remember,
I got us that mattress.
You went to my quarters.
Not interrupting?
Not at all. I was expecting you.
You called him?
Good. Come on in.
You too, Caprica.
What is this?
We're joining the baseship.
All of us.
- We can jump away when you're ready.
- Thank you.
- It's the right decision.
- No.
No, it's not. No.
The vote is you and Anders
versus me, Tory
and Galen.
Caprica, obviously,
that means you have to come too.
Wouldn't you like
to raise your child where it's safe?
I want him to be safe, yes.
She doesn't understand
what this means.
I used to think Hera
was the only hope for us.
But clearly
that's just not true anymore.
Her baby, he's pure Cylon.
If we go off and make
some pure Cylon culture,
that's what happened on Earth
and it led to disaster.
Pure human doesn't work.
Pure Cylon doesn't work.
It's too weak.
You just don't want to leave
the one you really love.
What?
- Talk to me. What is this?
- It's petty and vile.
Enough. She's voted.
When's the jump?
We can be ready in an hour.
- I'm not goin'.
- We agreed on majority rule.
Frak, apparently
we invented majority rule.
But I don't remember it,
so frak that.
Saul, don't let her...
All right, go. Go.
All of you.
Caprica. Go.
Go be pure and safe and whatever
- the frak. I'm not goin'.
- Do you see, little girl?
There is something in the universe
that he loves far more than you
or me...
And that's Bill Adama.
You don't even want to go.
This is all to hurt me.
- Bill Adama, the ship and the uniform.
- How can you sink so low?
- Everything else takes second place.
- Why doing this?
I knew I did.
But I always wondered
if a baby would.
Guess I know now.
Something's wrong...
Get Cottle.
You'll be okay.
Never seen anyone
get into trouble so fast,
but he's fighting back.
That's all I can tell you.
- I didn't mean this.
- Yeah, you did.
Here, this may help
increase his heart rate.
You knew how I would have to choose.
You knew what it meant.
I'm sorry.
Of course, Cylons and humans
need to stay together.
But I always intended... I just...
I didn't think.
Saul, I only wanted to hurt you,
- not her.
- You didn't think I would hurt her,
if I let her go.
It never occurred to you?
No wonder we had to invent them
some compassionate god to believe in.
We couldn't have them deify us,
could we?
- We didn't invent anything.
- Shut up. Just stop!
I'm so sorry.
Maybe...
I just shouldn't be here.
First intelligent thing you've said.
Talk to her.
Tell her you love her.
It's what she needs.
It's what the baby needs.
Listen.
I love you,
all right?
Can you hear me?
This is nonsense. She knows it.
I don't need to say it.
I shouldn't need to say it to anyone.
Isn't it enough that I feel it?
- Just tell her.
- I feel it.
For her. For you. For Liam.
Shouldn't need to spout the words.
I feel it less with words.
Just let me Gods damn feel it
and I'll fill the frakkin' room.
His heart rate is dropping.
I got signs of distress all over.
Doesn't look good.
I am so sorry.
Cut him out.
Even if it kills me.
He'll live
if you cut him out right now.
Cylon babies must be strong, right?
Hera was born early.
Cut him out.
I am not cutting you. Forget it.
He'll never make it. Four months?
- No.
- Please.
Caprica, listen,
I have to tell you.
He loves you
more than he ever loved me.
You are the mother of his son.
The boy is alive. I can see
his heartbeat on the monitor.
And that's proof.
Proof he loves you.
He loves you so much.
It's shining out of him.
You and he can stay on Galactica.
I'll go away with the others.
And you can be together.
A little family.
I promise it.
That's it. I'm sorry.
No, that was me.
That was me.
I take it back. I'm sorry.
The lady and I have some work to do.
It's time for you to leave.
You have to go now.
Nurse!
Out now.
She's in good hands.
The two of you can stay here
and listen to this.
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go to the head.
Do something constructive.
A little project I've been working on.
Listen to me, Admiral.
Just wait.
Explain what you mean.
What you have right now
is starving civilians
with no representation, no recourse.
They're broken.
They're exhausted.
They've had enough.
That's not a mutiny, Admiral.
- That is a revolution.
- And you can maintain order?
Listen to me. List...
Please, Admiral!
Galactica is slipping away from you
drop by drop.
You are pouring Cylon blood
into her veins.
I see the Cylon pilots.
We all see them.
We all see the Cylon workforce.
Where are they going
into the far recesses of the ship?
When are you inviting
the Centurions over to join
in all the fun we're having over here?
Of course, when you do that,
that very moment,
this becomes a blended ship.
Only half human.
And right now
I am here to tell you, your people...
Your people are not ready for that.
Listen to me, Admiral.
I am offering you
the last human solution
you will ever be presented with.
Well, guys, you did it.
I don't know how, but you did.
I told you, Paulla. I told you.
You do good deeds
and you are rewarded.
You're rewarded ten... Tenfold.
And then if you give...
Then you receive, don't you?
That was beautiful.
I'm sorry.
Liam.
His name was Liam.
It's a good name.
- Short for William.
- Yeah.
It's not like that. I know.
I know it's not.
I know.
It's okay.
It's okay.
These are the Cylons that have died
with us since the alliance.
I didn't know they were doing that.
Did you?
It's already happened, hasn't it?
<i>Précédemment dans</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
Des fissures
dans toutes les poutres.
Sur le vaisseau-mère,
il y a une chose qui pourrait servir.
Une résine organique
qui pousse dans le métal.
Elle durcit
en arrivant à maturation.
Par les Dieux.
Ellen Tigh.
Heureux de te revoir.
C'est Boomer.
Marines.
Emmenez cette Huit en cellule.
Si c'est moi, là-dedans,
je suis quoi ?
Je suis quoi ?
<i>Réveil, réveil.
Debout là-dedans et préparez-vous.</i>
<i>Nettoyez tous les compartiments.
Videz toutes les poubelles.</i>
<i>Récurez chaque recoin.</i>
<i>Rendez-vous chez le capitaine d'armes
pour l'appel,</i>
<i>personnel autorisé uniquement.</i>
Garde à vous !
Asseyez-vous.
Il est 6 h 21.
Synchronisation dans 3, 2, 1.
6 h 21, synchro.
Notre mission
est la même cette semaine...
Que la semaine dernière,
et celle d'avant.
Des patrouilles de Vipers
seront accompagnées
de Raiders lourds en couverture.
Ceux qui rentrent
de six jours de chasse à la planète
travailleront deux jours ici
avant de repartir.
N'oubliez pas que le premier à voir
un caillou habitable
recevra ce superbe produit
d'hygiène bucco-dentaire.
C'est le dernier tube de dentifrice
de l'univers.
Ce sera pas du luxe.
Notre mission
est la même cette semaine
que la semaine dernière,
et celle d'avant.
Chasseurs de planètes,
n'oubliez pas les rations de survie.
Si ces antiques FTL
vous lâchent dans la nature,
vous risquez de crever la dalle
le temps qu'on vous retrouve.
Suite à la mutinerie,
nos effectifs sont réduits.
On ne peut donc pas adjoindre
un technicien à chaque Raptor.
Savourez cette période de solitude,
mais vous branlez pas trop.
Vous devez économiser votre O².
Apprenez à savourer votre exil.
Évitez la masturbation.
Économisez l'O².
Vos affectations sont au tableau.
Les réparations du Galactica
entraîneront encore des coupures de jus.
Six vous donnera vos couleurs
et vos signaux d'identification.
Vous décollez à 7 h 10.
Bonne chasse.
Le colmatage
et le composé de consolidation
donneront au Galactica
quelques sauts de plus.
Mais pas beaucoup.
Combien ?
Impossible à dire...
Jusqu'à ce que sa coque cède.
On n'est pas encore prêts
à renoncer à ce vaisseau.
Si c'est terminé...
Sonja,
félicitations pour votre élection.
J'ai hâte de vous voir siéger
au prochain Quorum des capitaines.
Merci.
Mais je dois vous prévenir...
À cette occasion,
je demanderai que la Huit
retenue sur le Galactica
nous soit rendue.
- Boomer ?
- Oui, Sharon Valerii.
Elle m'a collé deux balles.
Je me suis mal exprimée.
On ne demande pas sa libération.
On veut la juger pour trahison.
Sharon Valerii s'est alliée à Cavil
durant notre guerre civile,
entraînant la mort
de milliers de nos camarades.
Si elle est reconnue coupable ?
Avant la guerre civile, la résurrection
rendait la peine capitale absurde.
- Maintenant qu'on est tous mortels...
- Vous voulez la tuer.
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA
Saison 4 - Épisode 17
39 556 SURVIVANTS
À LA RECHERCHE D'UN FOYER
Sous-titres
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-
- Il y a encore beaucoup d'activité.
- Le Dr Gerard dit que ces mesures
sont inédites
et franchement étranges.
Aucune évolution
depuis des semaines.
Et rien n'indique
la moindre reprise de conscience.
Peut-être que son cerveau se relance
et se réorganise en guérissant.
Arrêtez de nous soûler
avec vos idées à la con.
Si vous les faisiez plutôt sortir ?
Et si on arrivait à le brancher
comme les hybrides ?
Ses yeux étaient fermés
la dernière fois.
Ça arrive dans certains cas de coma.
Ça ne veut rien dire.
Tu vas devoir te faire une raison.
Et comment je suis censée faire ?
Tu dois reprendre une vie normale.
S'il y a une évolution,
tu seras la première informée.
Putain.
Tu vas jouer longtemps
le même morceau pourri ?
Arrête un peu.
Je joue pas le même morceau pourri.
Je le compose.
Quatre jours que je suis dessus.
Je galère.
Alors, arrête. À quoi ça rime ?
À quoi ça rime ?
Le but est d'apporter
un peu de grâce et de beauté
- à une vie laide et brutale.
- Te fous pas de moi, putain.
Tu jouais, pendant que les Cylons
attaquaient les 12 colonies ?
Elle a stoppé un seul missile,
ta musique ?
C'est plutôt cynique.
Il t'est arrivé quelque chose.
Je me demande quoi.
On ferme.
Finissez vos verres et partez.
J'ai un conseil pour toi.
Pour devenir un grand compositeur,
apprends à jouer d'abord...
Quelquefois, au travail,
j'essaie de me rappeler
à quoi ressemble ton visage.
La courbe de tes lèvres.
Tes cheveux. Ton odeur.
Tu vois mon visage tous les jours.
Oui, mais pas comme ça.
- Tu sais, entre nous...
- C'était rien.
Rien.
Tu es une machine, pas moi.
Quoi que je sois,
je sais ce que j'ai ressenti.
Un programme ne ressent rien.
Combien d'entre nous ont fini
avec la personne qu'ils voulaient ?
Se sont retrouvés coincés
avec le moins pire ?
Et pourquoi ?
Parce que ceux
qu'on voulait vraiment,
qu'on aimait vraiment,
étaient morts ou mourants...
Je t'aime, chef.
Bon sang.
Les gars, tirez pas tout le jus
sur la même prise !
- Tu as quelque chose pour moi ?
- Entre.
Ça va te faire plaisir.
Coucou, Hera.
Tu dessines des étoiles ?
Ce sont de belles étoiles.
Merci.
Tu reconnais ça ?
Ce sont mes affaires.
- Quand on t'a crue morte...
- Les pilotes ont vendu ça aux enchères.
J'ai fini par tout récupérer
en les rachetant,
en suppliant ou en volant.
Pour moi ?
Merci.
Merci.
Et le reste ?
Garde-le.
<i>Dieu merci.</i>
<i>Je sais pas ce que je fais là.</i>
<i>Quand j'ai tiré sur le patron,</i>
<i>ce que tu m'as dit,</i>
le regard que tu me jetais...
<i>J'espérais qu'on puisse
réparer nos erreurs sur New Caprica.</i>
<i>On ne force pas les gens à vous aimer
en pointant une arme sur eux.</i>
<i>Je le sais, maintenant.</i>
<i>Mais à ce moment-là,
je me sentais trahie.</i>
<i>Alors, j'ai voulu t'oublier</i>
<i>et te haïr.</i>
<i>Ça n'a pas marché.</i>
<i>J'ai pensé à toi chaque jour
depuis que je suis morte dans tes bras.</i>
<i>Moi aussi.</i>
<i>Si j'avais su ce que j'étais
à ce moment-là...</i>
<i>Je sais.</i>
<i>Galen, ça va, vraiment.</i>
<i>Le plus important,
c'est qu'on sait désormais ce qu'on est.</i>
Profitons du temps qui nous reste.
S'il te plaît.
C'est quoi, ça ?
Notre maison.
Sur Picon.
Celle qu'on voulait construire
en quittant l'armée.
Arrête ça.
<i>Arrête.</i>
<i>Désolée.</i>
Je pensais que tu accepterais
une projection cylon.
Le retour de la critique.
- Je voulais voir si t'avais progressé.
- À toi de me le dire.
C'est plus long.
Plein de notes.
- Tu détestes ?
- J'ai pas dit ça.
T'as été méchamment honnête,
l'autre soir.
- Pourquoi être diplomate ?
- Je suis pas diplomate,
espèce de crétin hypersensible.
J'ai dit que j'aimais bien.
Vraiment ?
Pourquoi ?
C'est difficile à exprimer.
Ça m'a fait penser à...
quelqu'un qui court
après une voiture.
C'était pas vraiment l'idée.
J'essayais de transmettre
un sentiment de perte.
C'est de ça que je parlais.
C'est comme perdre une personne
à laquelle on tient.
Sa voiture s'éloigne.
On la poursuit.
Mais elle va trop vite.
C'est tout ?
On va attendre sans rien faire ?
- Les laisser la tuer par vengeance ?
- On ferait quoi ?
Une demande de grâce ?
- On peut pas interférer.
- On peut pas se poser en Dieux.
Les rebelles sont les victimes.
Ils ont tous les droits
de décider de sa punition.
Non !
Boomer t'a sauvée.
Tu serais pas là sans elle.
Et j'en témoignerai à son procès,
mais je ne l'arrêterai pas.
On doit laisser justice se faire.
Alors, ils vont...
la tuer.
C'est certain.
On y passera tous.
- Merci de participer, colonel.
- Il vient de perdre son enfant.
Lâche-le un peu.
<i>Depuis quand...</i>
<i>tu fais ça ?</i>
<i>Un moment.</i>
C'est mon jardin secret.
<i>Pour me sentir près de toi.</i>
Tu te souviens
<i>comme on peaufinait chaque détail ?</i>
<i>C'est surtout toi qui peaufinais.
Moi, je...</i>
<i>J'écoutais.</i>
<i>Vraiment ?
T'as dessiné combien de plans ?</i>
<i>C'était juste de la minutie, ça.</i>
On n'a pas construit de maison,
<i>alors je l'ai construite
dans ma tête.</i>
<i>Je voulais tant
la partager avec toi.</i>
<i>T'es sûr ?
Je veux pas te pousser...</i>
On tient le premier mouvement.
Voyons le deuxième...
J'ai pas d'idées...
Ça va, c'est qu'un obstacle.
La clé, c'est de pas paniquer.
Il faut rester confiant
et ça va venir.
Ça fait partie du processus.
Voler d'autres compositeurs aussi ?
Tu plagies le second mouvement
de la <i>Troisième Sonate de Nomion</i>.
Du moins, ça y ressemble.
Perdu.
Ça se prononce "no-mayan".
C'est mon modèle.
Quand je sèche, je m'inspire de lui.
Pour quelqu'un qui déteste la musique,
t'en connais un rayon.
Mon père jouait.
Raconte-moi.
Il t'a forcée à apprendre,
et il était tellement perfectionniste
que tu détestais ça ?
Non, j'adorais, en fait.
Il m'asseyait près de lui
quand il jouait.
Il sentait le tabac.
Il m'a appris quelques morceaux.
J'essayais vraiment
de bien les jouer.
Pas par peur de le mettre en colère,
mais pour qu'il soit fier.
L'un des morceaux
qu'il m'a appris
me rendait heureuse
et triste en même temps.
Ce sont les meilleurs.
Comment j'ai pu trouver mon corps
alors que je suis toujours là ?
Je suis quoi ?
Un fantôme ? Un démon ?
Tu demandes à la mauvaise personne.
Je suis qu'un pianiste.
Quand je guidais
la flotte vers la Terre,
tout semblait si clair.
Pour la première fois,
je savais ce que je faisais
et pourquoi j'étais là.
Là, je suis à nouveau perdue.
Écoute,
tu te sens peut-être mal,
mais parfois on a besoin
de se sentir perdu.
C'est pas parce que tu ignores ta voie
que tu n'en as pas.
Madame la présidente.
Je vous le demande
comme une faveur personnelle,
ne signez pas.
Non, chef.
Sharon Valerii exploite
nos sentiments personnels.
Vous le savez.
Mieux que quiconque.
Reprenez vos esprits.
Vous n'avez pas besoin de la tuer.
- Laissez-la en cellule.
- Non.
Elle est dangereuse,
en cellule ou pas.
Pour nous et pour nos alliés cylons.
Il doit y avoir une autre solution,
s'il vous plaît.
S'il vous plaît.
Le sujet est clos,
chef.
Vous pouvez disposer.
Vérifiez le fusible.
Quoi ?
- Quoi, c'était bien.
- De la merde.
Tu devrais faire une pause,
tirer ton coup.
Ça pourrait dissiper la tension.
C'est pour ça qu'elle t'a quitté ?
T'as encore la marque de l'alliance.
Elle a dû y être un moment.
Trop longtemps.
- C'est moi qui l'ai quittée.
- Pourquoi ?
Elle voulait que j'arrête le piano.
Tu l'as quittée à cause de ça ?
Je jouais régulièrement,
je gagnais correctement ma vie.
Quand on a eu un enfant,
elle a dit que ça suffisait plus.
Elle voulait
que j'aie un vrai travail.
- J'ai dit que je préférerais me tuer.
- Par les Dieux, t'es comme mon père.
Tu fondes une famille et tu les plantes
quand ça devient dur...
T'as songé un instant
à ce que t'as fait à ton gamin ?
<i>Vous avez réussi, merci, chef.</i>
<i>Chaque fois qu'il y a une coupure,
on doit descendre vérifier les verrous.</i>
La prisonnière est toujours là.
Elle a dormi tout le temps.
Vous restez un peu ?
On dit qu'ils la transfèrent demain.
J'ai dit ce que j'avais à lui dire.
Ce que ton père a fait
était peut-être mal.
Mais il t'a quand même
laissé quelque chose.
Il t'a appris le piano.
J'ai jamais joué après son départ.
Et ce morceau qu'il t'a appris ?
Celui qui te rend heureuse et triste
à la fois, joue-le-moi.
Même si je m'en souvenais,
je le jouerais pas.
Ce fils de pute est jamais revenu.
Il a jamais appelé, jamais écrit.
Alors, tu ne joues plus
pour le punir ?
Viens, joue-moi un morceau.
Ça te fera pas de mal.
Je te montre, c'est facile.
Allez.
Me force pas à te faire mal.
On y va.
Ça va là.
Et celle-là va là.
Vas-y.
C'est bon.
- Tout va bien.
- Joue, s'il te plaît.
Je vais jouer.
Seulement si tu joues.
Super.
J'espère que tu viens
réparer cette fichue douche.
Athena.
Helo.
- Je pensais pas...
- Que je te laisserais partir 6 jours
dans l'espace,
sans un vrai au revoir ?
Y aura personne ici
avant 20 minutes.
- Tu sens bon.
- J'ai récupéré du vrai savon.
Il a aussi bon goût ?
Ça va pas ?
Cottle avait raison,
j'aurais pas dû insister pour le voir.
Il avait les yeux ouverts.
J'étais pas prêt à ça.
Le petit gars me regardait
droit dans les yeux.
Très bien,
je crois que t'y étais presque.
Il manque un truc.
C'est la main gauche.
Je vais la faire.
Je pense savoir ce que tu fais.
Attends.
Je rêve.
Ça colle.
Joue la ligne du bas.
Quand tu seras prête.
Coucou, bébé.
Devine ce que maman t'apporte.
Bois tout. C'est bon, n'est-ce pas ?
On avait oublié sa visite médicale.
Laisse-moi t'aider.
Doucement, chef.
Merci.
C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
C'est la chanson.
- Où t'as appris ça ?
- Je le jouais, petite.
- Mon père...
- Qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?
Qui a écrit ça ?
Viens avec moi.
J'y arriverai pas sans toi.
Mais si.
On se reverra.
Tu dois savoir quelque chose.
Tout ce que j'ai dit...
sur nous.
Je le pensais vraiment.
Alors, quoi qu'il arrive...
Il a tiré avant d'acquérir la cible,
révélant sa position, ce qui fut fatal.
Évitez ça à tout prix.
Durant l'exercice, 6 ou 8 vaisseaux
pourraient intervenir dans le combat.
Alors, soyez vigilants,
en particulier sur l'axe vertical.
Par les Dieux, Athena.
Dans le vestiaire, c'était Boomer.
Elle a pris Hera ?
Six, appelez un médecin, vite.
K-Ro, préviens le CIC
que Boomer s'est échappée.
Elle a ma gamine !
Officier de pont, ici Athena.
Quand puis-je partir ?
<i>Patientez, Raptor 7-1-9.</i>
<i>Il y a du trafic,
on vous cherche un créneau.</i>
<i>Attendez nos ordres.</i>
Allez.
Elle ne marche pas.
Elle chauffe ses moteurs.
Boomer, ici le commandant.
<i>Repassez en attente
et coupez vos moteurs.</i>
Bien reçu.
Hoshi.
Envoyez la CAP, pour interception.
Blue leader, ordre prioritaire.
Rejoignez le Galactica
et engagez le Raptor 2-1-9.
<i>Tir autorisé.</i>
<i>Patrouille Blue, c'est parti.</i>
Si tu décolles, Boomer,
<i>je te fais descendre.</i>
Vous ne feriez pas ça,
sachant que j'ai Hera à bord.
On peut pas la laisser partir.
Rentrez le pont d'envol.
Elle chauffe son FTL.
Si elle saute dans le vaisseau,
l'onde de choc
pourrait éventrer le Galactica.
Rentrez le pont d'envol.
Je répète, rentrez le pont d'envol.
Fais pas ça.
<i>Fais pas ça, fais pas ça !</i>
Frak !
Hera.
J'ai besoin d'une équipe d'étayage
à l'avant, immédiatement !
<i>Les 8 se ressemblent toutes.</i>
<i>Comment vous avez pu rater
une gamine de 3 ans ?</i>
- Qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
- Boomer a pris sa fille.
- Quoi ?
- Elle a pris Hera à la crèche.
<i>Vous laissez une fille de 3 ans
monter dans un Raptor ?</i>
<i>Comment ?</i>
- <i>Désolé, personne n'a vu votre fille.
- Impossible ! On a dû la voir !</i>
<i>Elle a 3 ans.
Expliquez-moi comment elle a...</i>
C'était un coup monté.
Mon évasion, tout.
J'étais seulement
le ticket d'entrée de Boomer.
Cavil voulait Hera.
Boomer s'en est chargée.
Comment une gamine de 3 ans
a pu spontanément
écrire ce morceau ?
Elle est impliquée
dans ce qui nous manipule tous.
Anders pourrait nous aider.
S'il se réveille un jour.
<i>Previously on </i>
Battlestar Galactica...
Hairline fractures in all the beams.
Her bones are rotten. There's something
on the baseship that can help.
It's this organic resin.
It'll grow into the metal.

Oh, my Gods.
It's Ellen Tigh.
Nice to see you again.
This is Boomer.
Marines.
Take this number Eight to the brig.
If that's me lying there,

What am I?

Our mission is the same this week...
as it was the week before that,
and the week before that.
We'll be flying Viper CAPs
in conjunction
with heavy Raider pickets
from the baseship.
Those of you who just came back
from six-day planet hunts
will get two days local duty

Remember, the first one

It is the last tube of Tauran toothpaste

Gods know most of you need it.
Our mission is the same this week

Planet hunters, make sure to draw
long duration provisions.
If those clapped-out FTLs
go down when you're out there,
you're gonna get mighty hungry waiting
for the SAR birds to find you.
As you know,
the mutiny has thinned our ranks.
We cannot give
all you Raptor jocks back-seaters.
Savor this alone time,
but do not whack too much.
We need you to conserve your O˛.
Learn to savor your alone time.
Wank as little as possible.
Conserve your O˛.
Planet search assignments
are on the duty board.
Be advised the repairs
to Galactica will continue
to cause sporadic power outages.
Six has the color assignments
and your recognition signals.
Engines start at 0710.
Good hunting.
So the stop-drilling
and the shoring compound
will buy the Galactica
a few more jumps.
But not many.
- How many?
- Impossible to say...
until the hull caves in.
But we're not ready
to give up on the old girl just yet.
Well, if there's nothing else,
Sonja...
I wanna congratulate you
on your election.
I look forward to seeing you
taking your seat
in the Quorum of ship's captains
next week.
Thank you,
but you should know something.
When we convene, I intend to formally
request that the Eight you're holding
in Galactica's brig...
be returned to us.
- Boomer?
- Yes, Sharon Valerii.
She put two holes in me.
I'm afraid I didn't word that right.
We don't want Boomer set free.
We wanna try Boomer for treason.
Sharon Valerii sided with Cavil
in the Cylon civil war,
which killed thousands
of our comrades.
And if she's convicted?
Before the civil war, resurrection
made capital punishment pointless.
But now that we're all mortal...
You want to kill her.

- There's a lot still going on in there.
- Dr. Gerard said these readings
are unprecedented and,
frankly, bizarre.
They haven't changed in weeks.
And there is nothing to indicate that
he's having any conscious thought.
Well, maybe his brain is rebooting.
Reorganizing as it heals.
The last thing we need is you jerking
our chains with a lotta quack ideas.
Why don't you take them
someplace else?
What if we could link him
to a datastream like our hybrids?
His eyes were closed last time.
Well, that's not unusual in a coma.
Doesn't mean anything.
You're gonna have
to come to grips with that.
And how am I supposed to do that?
You need to get on with your life.
If there's any change,
you'll be the first one to know.
Gods damn it.
Do you have to continue
to play the same lame-ass song?
Give it a rest.
I'm not playing the same lame-ass song.
I'm composing it.
Been at it for four days now.
It's hell.
So then quit. What's the point?
The point?
The point is to bring a little grace
and beauty to an otherwise
- ugly and brutal existence.
- Gimme a frakking break.
Is that what you were doing when
the Cylons attacked the 12 colonies?
Did your music stop one missile?
Pretty cynical point of view.
Something happened to you.
Yeah.
I wonder what it could be.
Closing time.
Drink up and let's go, folks.
I have an observation for you.
You wanna be an immortal composer,
you better learn how to play that thing.
You know, sometimes at work,
I try to conjure up
what your face looks like.
Curve of your lips.
Way your hair falls.
How you smell.
You see my face every day.
Yeah, but not like this.
- You know, what we had...
- it was nothing.
Nothing.
You're a machine. I'm not.
Well, whatever I am,
I know how I felt.
Software doesn't have feelings.
How many of us ended up with the people
we really wanted to be with?
Got stuck with the best
of limited options?
And why?
Because the ones we really wanted...
that we really loved
were dead, dying...
I love you, Chief.
Gods damn it.
Come on, people,
you can't draw
your power from the same bus!
- You said you had something for me.
- Come in.
I got something
that'll cheer you up.
Hey, Hera.
Whatcha drawing, stars?
Those are very good stars.
Thank you.
Recognize any of this?
That's my stuff.
- When we all thought you were dead...
- The pilots auctioned it off, I know.
Took me a while but I managed
to buy, beg, and steal them back.
That for me?
Thank you.
Thank you.
What about the rest?
Keep it.
<i>Thank God.</i>
<i>I don't know why i'm here.</i>
<i>You know, when I shot the old man,</i>
<i>the things that you said to me...</i>
the way that you looked at me...
<i>I thought New Caprica
was a way to set things right.</i>
<i>You can't force people to love you
at the point of a gun.</i>
<i>I know that now.</i>
<i>But at the time I felt betrayed.</i>
<i>So I wanted to forget you...</i>
<i>and hate you.</i>
<i>Didn't work.</i>
<i>I've thought about you every day
since that moment I died in your arms.</i>
<i>Me too.</i>
<i>If I had known back then
what I am...</i>
<i>I know.</i>
<i>Galen, it's okay, really.</i>
<i>I mean, the most important thing
is that we both know who we are now.</i>
<i>Let's make the most
with the time that we have left.</i>
<i>Please?</i>
What the hell is this?
Our house.
On Picon.
It's the one that we planned to build
when we mustered out.
Stop it.
<i>Stop this.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, Galen.</i>
I thought you'd be okay
with Cylon projection.
The critic returns.
I thought I'd see
if you were making any progress.
You tell me.
It's longer.
Lotta notes.
- You hate it?
- I didn't say that.
You were savagely honest with me
the other night.
- Why be diplomatic now?
- I'm not being diplomatic,
you oversensitive jackass.
I said I liked it.
Really?
Why?
It's hard to put into words.
Made me think of...
someone chasing after a car.
Not exactly what I was going for.
I was trying to convey
a sense of loss.
That's...
that's what I meant.
It's like losing someone
that you care about.
Their car pulls away. You...
You chase 'em.
But they're going too fast.
So that's it?
We're just gonna sit on our hands?
- Let our people kill her for vengeance?
- What do you expect us to do?
Issue a formal decree of clemency?
We can't interfere.
We can't set ourselves up as Gods.
The rebels
are the aggrieved parties.
They have every right
to determine Valerii's...
- Can't!
- ... punishement.
Boomer saved your life.
You wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for her.
And I will testify to that at her trial,
but I won't try to stop it.
We have
to let justice run its course.
Then they will
kill her.
Sure as hell.
We're all in hell.
- Thanks for your input, Colonel.
- He just lost his child.
You leave him be.
<i>How long you been...</i>
<i>Going there?</i>
<i>A while.</i>
Became my secret retreat.
<i>A way of feeling close to you.</i>
Do you remember
<i>how we obsessed
over every little detail?</i>
<i>That was...</i>
<i>You...</i>
<i>obsessing. I was just...</i>
<i>Listening.</i>
<i>Really?</i>
<i>How many floor plans did you draw?</i>
<i>That's...</i>
<i>being thorough.</i>
We never had a chance to build it,
<i>so I built it in my head.</i>
<i>And I wanted so much
to share it with you.</i>
<i>Are you sure?
I don't want to put you through any...</i>
We've nailed the first movement.
Now how about the second?
It's okay, it's just the next hurdle.
The key is to, you know, not panic.
Just trust yourself
something's gonna come.
It's just part of the process.
Is part of the process
also stealing from other composers?
That piece you're riffing off of,
it's Nomion's 3rd Sonata, 2nd movement.
I mean,
it's what it sounded like anyway.
No you're dead on the money.
It's pronounced "no-mayan".
Anyway, he's my touchstone.
Whenever I come up dry,
I look to him for inspiration.
And for somebody who hates music
so much, you know an awful lot about it.
My dad used to play.
So what's the story?
He forced you to learn,
and he was such a perfectionist,
you grew to hate it?
No, I loved it... actually.
He used to sit me next to him
on the bench when he played.
Smell of tobacco on his breath.
He taught me a few songs.
I used to try
so hard to get 'em right.
Not because I was afraid he'd get angry,
but because I knew he'd be so proud.
There was this one song that
he taught me.
It made me feel happy
and sad all at the same time.
The best ones do.
How is it possible that I found my body
and I'm still here?
I mean, what am I?
A ghost? A demon?
You're asking the wrong guy.
I'm just a piano player.
When I was leading
the fleet to Earth,
everything seemed so clear.
For the first time in my life,
I knew what I was doing
and why I was here.
Now I'm just adrift again.
Listen,
you may feel like hell.
But sometimes lost
is where you need to be.
Just because
you don't know your direction
doesn't mean you don't have one.
Madam President.
I'm asking you
as a personal favor to me,
don't sign that.
Don't do that, Chief.
Personal feelings are what
Sharon Valerii preys upon.
You know that
better than any of us.
You need to clear your head.
You don't have to kill her.
Leave her in the brig.
She is a danger in the brig,
out of the brig.
A danger to us,
a danger to our Cylon allies.
This can't be the last option,
Madam, please.
Madam President, please.
We're done here,
Chief.
You're dismissed.
Somebody check the fuse.
What?
- What, that was good.
- It's crap.
Maybe you need to take a break.
Get yourself laid or something.
That might dissipate the tension.
That why she left you?
That's a pretty deep groove
on your finger.
Had to have been there for a while.
Too long.
- She didn't leave me, I left her.
- Why?
She wanted me to quit
playing the piano.
You left her for that?
I was playing steady gigs.
Making decent money.
Now that we had a kid,
she said it wasn't enough.
Said I had to get a real job.
I told her I might as well
cut my heart out.
My Gods, you're just like my father.
You start a family,
the going gets tough, you ditch 'em.
Did you ever stop thinking
about yourself long enough
to consider
what you did to your kid?
<i>You got it. Thanks, Chief.</i>
<i>Every time the godsdamn power goes out,
we gotta go down and check the locks.</i>
Prisoner's still secure.
She slept right through it.
You gonna stay a while?
Word is they're shipping her out
tomorrow.
Said all I needed to say.
So maybe what your old man did
was wrong.
But he still left you
with something.
He taught you how to play the piano.
I never played after he left.
What about that song?
That song he taught you.
The one that makes you happy and sad
at the same time. Play that for me.
I don't frakking remember it.
And even if I did, I wouldn't.
That son-of-a-bitch never came back.
He never called. He never wrote.
So you quit playing to punish him?
Come on, play me a song.
It won't hurt. Come on.
I'll show you. It's easy.
Come on.
Don't make me hurt you.
Here we go.
That goes there.
And that goes there.
Go ahead.
It's okay.
- It's okay.
- You play, please.
I'll play.
I'll play if you play.
Great.
I hope you're here
to fix the frakking shower.
Boomer.
Athena.
Helo.
- I didn't think...
- You didn't think I'd let you go
on a six-day mission in deep space
without a proper goodbye, did you?
Next flight team's not suiting up
for another 20.
You smell good.
I made a trade for some real soap.
Taste as good as it smells?
Something wrong?
Cottle was right. I never should have
insisted on seeing him.
His eyes were open.
I wasn't ready for that.
Little guy was looking right at me.
It's all right, I think...
I think you almost had it.
Something's missing.
It's the left hand.
I'll play down here.
I think I know what you're doing.
Now hang on.
Holy crap.
That's right.
Play the bottom, okay?
Come in when you think you're ready.
Hey, baby.
Hi.
Guess what mommy brought you?
Drink it all, yeah. Good, right?
We forgot
all about her physical today.
Let me give you a hand with that.
Easy, easy, Chief.
Thanks.
What the frak?
That's the song.
- Where'd you learn to play that song?
- I played it as a kid.
My father...
What are you talking about?
Who did this?
Come with me.
I can't do it without you.
Yeah, you can.
We'll meet again.
There's something
I want you to remember.
All the things that I said...
about us.
I meant them with all my heart.
So no matter what happens...
He fired
before he acquired the target,
gave away his position,
that was the end of him.
So don't let this happen to you.
During this exercise,
we could have 6 or 8 ships
hitting the merge
where the fight starts.
So keep your head on a swivel,
especially in the vertical.
Oh, my Gods, Athena.
In the locker room. It was Boomer.
Did she get Hera?
Six, get a med team here
right frakking now.
K-ro, get on the horn to CIC
and let 'em know Boomer's loose.
She's got my frakking kid!
LSO, Athena, what's the delay
with my flight clearance?
<i>Please hold, Raptor 719.</i>
<i>We're still waiting
for traffic to clear your flight path.</i>
<i>Stand by for instructions.</i>
Come on.
She's not buying it, sir.
She initiated prestart.
Boomer, this is Galactica actual.
<i>Return to checkers red
and shut down.</i>
Copy.
Hoshi.
Vector the CAP to intercept.
Blue leader, Galactica. Immediate.
Proceed directly to Galactica.
Engage Raptor two-one-niner.
<i>Weapons free.</i>
<i>Blue flight, rolling in hot.</i>
If you launch, Boomer,
<i>I will shoot you down.</i>
I don't think you wanna do that
while I have Hera on board.
We can't let her get off this ship.
Retract the flight pods.
Sir, she's spooling to jump.
If she jumps inside the ship,
the spatial disruption
could tear Galactica's guts out.
Retract the flight pods.
Retract flight pods.
I say again, retract flight pods.
Don't do it.
<i>Don't do it, don't do it!</i>
Frak!
Hera.
I need a team, scaffolding,
shoring compound
to the forward magazine right away!
<i>One Eight looks like another.</i>
<i>How did a three-year old girl
get by you, though?</i>
- The hell's going on up there?
- Boomer took her kid.
What?
She took Hera
and just walked out of the daycare.
<i>How do you let a three-year old girl
climb into a Raptor?</i>
<i>How did she get by you?</i>
<i>I'm sorry, sir,
but nobody saw your daughter.</i>
<i>That's impossible!
Somebody saw her!</i>
<i>She's a three-year old child.
Explain to me how she gets by...</i>
Had to be orchestrated
from the beginning.
My escape, all of it.
I was just a means
to get Boomer here.
Cavil wanted Hera.
Boomer got her for him.
How can a three-year old girl
spontaneously write down that song?
She's plugged into something
that's manipulating all of us.
Maybe Anders could help us.
If he ever wakes up.
<i>Précédemment dans</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
Je suis quoi ?
Un fantôme ? Un démon ?
Tu te trompes de personne.
Je suis que pianiste.
- Pour moi ?
- Tiens.
Je rêve.
Sam !
- Il y a encore beaucoup d'activité.
- Rien n'indique
la moindre reprise de conscience.
Et si on arrivait à le brancher
comme les hybrides ?
Il faut élaborer
un plan d'urgence pour le vaisseau.
Regarde la vérité en face :
tu vas le perdre.
Boomer s'est échappée.
Elle a ma gamine !
Préviens le CIC et l'amiral.
- Boomer chauffe son FTL.
- Si elle saute,
l'onde de choc
pourrait éventrer le Galactica.
De quoi tu te plains ?
Vos alliages se combinent mal
avec la résine.
C'est pas notre faute
si votre saloperie sert à que dalle,
à part faire régner
une odeur de chiottes.
Ah ouais ?
Je croyais que ça venait de toi.
Tu bosses de ton côté
et moi du mien !
Pas avec ce type,
c'est pas le moment.
- Arrête de chialer !
- Pas maintenant.
- OK ! D'accord !
- Allons-y.
Si John avait prévu
d'enlever Hera pour l'étudier.
L'étudier ? Ils vont la disséquer
comme un rat de labo.
S'il compte déterminer
ce qui fait d'elle
un hybride humain/cylon viable,
il l'emmènera à la Colonie.
- La Colonie ?
- C'est un peu notre foyer.
On s'y est retrouvés avec les Centurions
après la première guerre,
après les avoir convaincus
d'abandonner
leurs expériences sur l'évolution
en échange de la résurrection.
Elle sait où elle se trouve.
Vous voulez faire sauter le Galactica
dans une ruche à Cylons,
tout risquer
rien que pour un enfant.
- C'est bien ça, colonel ?
- C'est pas n'importe quel enfant.
Avec la fausse couche de Caprica Six,
Hera est notre seul espoir
d'éviter l'extinction.
Elle est peut-être aussi
notre seul espoir.
Je viens...
On vient de vivre
quelque chose d'incroyable.
Hera a écrit les notes d'un morceau.
Un morceau que mon père me jouait
quand j'étais enfant.
Le même qui nous a activés
quand on était dans la nébuleuse.
Et qui nous a menés à la Terre.
Il se passe quelque chose,
quelque chose qui nous dépasse tous,
et tout tourne
autour de cette petite fille.
Elle est la clé, amiral.
En d'autres mots,
c'est notre destin d'aller la chercher ?
Négatif.
J'en ai ras la casquette du destin,
de la prophétie,
de Dieu ou des Dieux.
Regardez où ça nous a menés.
Au beau milieu de nulle part.
La moitié de la flotte est décimée,
la Terre est en cendres,
et je peux pas me déplacer
dans mon vaisseau
sans craindre de prendre une balle
pour nous avoir conduits jusqu'ici.
On est vivants.
Il y a quatre ans,
j'aurais pas parié là-dessus.
Autorise une mission de reco,
qu'on puisse évaluer l'ennemi.
Prenez un Raider lourd.
Helo et Athena
ne doivent pas l'apprendre.
Regarde-moi.
Regarde-moi.
Regarde-moi.
Tu me détestes ?
Dis-le.
Dis-le.
Putain de merde.
Hera ?
J'ai refait ce rêve.
À l'aide !
Attrape-le !
Tenez-le !
Attrape la porte !
Verrouille-la !
Verrouille-la !

Hémorragie interne.
Je l'emmène en chirurgie.
OK.
- Espérons qu'on ait pas de coupure.
- Quel est le bilan ?
61 morts ou disparus,
dont 26 des leurs.
Les Leoben parlent de la goutte
qui fera déborder le vase.
Selon eux, il nous reste 5 sauts.
Après,
on a 90 % de chances de destruction.
90 %, ça rime à rien.
Revenez
quand vous serez sûr à 100 %.
- Allez vous faire soigner.
- Entendu.
La représentante cylon, Sonja,
veut savoir quand tu comptes
faire évacuer le vaisseau.
Pour aller sur leur vaisseau-mère ?
C'est pas demain la veille.
C'est ce que j'ai répondu.
Je vais superviser les réparations,
on va le réparer.
Difficile de dire adieu
à tes deux amours en même temps.
Tu dois penser qu'on t'abandonne.
Personne n'abandonne personne.
Aucun de mes amours n'est mourant.
Ils ont juste besoin
qu'on s'occupe d'eux.
Hera.
L'amiral Adama
va devoir abandonner le Galactica.
- Oui.
- Ce jour-là,
le vaisseau-mère cylon
sera notre seul moyen de défense.
Sous le commandement de l'amiral,
renforcé par les pilotes du Galactica,
ses avions et son personnel militaire,
comme depuis toujours.
M. Adama,
il paraît clair qu'on mettrait
un grand pouvoir entre les mains
de certaines "personnes",
passez-moi l'expression,
qui, encore récemment,
s'appliquaient à nous éliminer !
- Je note vos inquiétudes.
- Comme vous le savez...
Laissez-moi parler !
Comme vous le savez, nous avons accepté
l'autorité militaire de l'amiral Adama
en échange d'un siège à ce conseil.
- Nous comptons tenir cette promesse.
- En parlant de promesses,
je me plains de la qualité de l'air
sur le Hitei Kan depuis le début.
Je demande, dès maintenant,
que nous soit réservé
le filtre à particule
et à CO² du Galactica.
- Pardon ?
- Tant qu'on récupère les FTL.
Notre dernier saut d'urgence
a pris plus de six minutes !
Attendez.
De toute évidence, nous devons faire
un inventaire complet
des équipements du Galactica.
Peut-être même une loterie,
pour garantir
une distribution équitable
des équipements.
Vous allez m'écouter, bon sang !
Personne
ne touche le moindre boulon
de ce Battlestar,
avant que l'amiral
ne donne son accord.
Vraiment !
Et qu'en pense Gaius Baltar ?
Gaius Baltar ?
<i>Des anges.</i>
<i>Des anges, avez-vous dit ?</i>
<i>Les anges ne se montrent pas</i>
<i>sous une forme mystique
et spectrale.</i>
<i>Ils adoptent l'apparence</i>
<i>de ceux qui vous sont proches,</i>
<i>de ceux qui comprennent vos doutes</i>
<i>et vos épreuves,</i>
<i>et qui vous guident
vers votre salut.</i>
<i>Je crois en ces anges</i>
parce que je les vois.
Où que vous soyez dans la flotte,
Gaius Baltar vous souhaite
une belle journée.
Pardon.
Caprica ? Caprica Six !
Ça me fait plaisir de...
Écoute, j'ai appris pour...
ton deuil et je voulais
te présenter mes condoléances.
- Je suis vraiment désolé.
- Merci, Gaius.
Je vois que tu as...
- Si tu as besoin de quelque chose...
- Non, merci.
Je sais aussi
pour ta situation.
Si tu veux un hébergement.
Aucune envie de rejoindre ton harem.
C'est pas ce que...
Je pensais pas...
On essaie de faire bouger les choses
dans la flotte.
Tu n'as pas changé, Gaius.
Du tout.
Moi, oui.
- Elle veut vous parler.
- À moi ?
Elle est mourante.
Vous pouvez libérer 5 minutes
dans votre emploi du temps chargé
et les passer avec elle.
Merci.
Merci pour quoi ?
Pour me permettre
de finalement rencontrer mon père
avant de mourir.
Tu ne devrais pas me remercier.
J'ai passé le plus clair de ma vie
à tuer tes semblables.
"Une trop grande confusion".
Je veux ma maman.
Je veux ma maman et ma maison.
Le FTL est d'origine
sur cette relique.
Si tu crois que je vais endurer
tes pleurnicheries
pendant encore 12 sauts, tu rêves.
Je veux ma maman et ma maison.
T'as gagné !
Voyons si tu pleures en dormant.
Ça va être une sacrée sieste.
Ils font pas les doses enfant.
Donne ton bras !
Ça va ?
Saul, c'est Hera.
On doit faire plus.
Je lui ai fait envoyer
une mission de reco.
Une "mission de reco".
L'avenir des nôtres est en jeu,
et tu obtiens une "mission de reco".
Les "nôtres".
Parfaitement, Saul.
Dieux merci.
Vide !
Tu sais qui sont "les miens" ?
L'équipage de ce vaisseau.
Avec qui j'ai combattu,
versé mon sang.
Le Patron, l'équipage.
Ils sont ma famille.
La seule que je connaisse
et qui compte pour moi.
T'es un emmerdeur.
Vraiment.
Ton "Patron".
Depuis combien de temps ?
J'étais ta femme 2 000 ans
avant que tu rencontres Bill Adama.
2 000, c'est un nombre.
Et rien de plus pour moi.
Du vent.
Mais l'amitié de cet homme... Ça !
- Tu es un Cylon, Saul.
- Ouais.
Que tu t'en souviennes ou pas,
tu dois au moins comprendre
ce que nous tentions de faire.
Nous voulions mettre fin à la guerre
entre les hommes et les machines.
Raté.
Oui, nous avons échoué,
mais nous avons
une seconde chance aujourd'hui.
Hera.
Sans elle,
nos enfants vont mourir
l'un après l'autre.
C'est le cas à l'infirmerie,
en ce moment même.
J'ai eu un enfant.
Il est mort.
Tu te trompes, Saul.
Tu en as des millions.
Allez. Tu dois avoir faim.
Mange ça.
Tu sais ce que je fais parfois,
quand je suis triste ?
Je vais dans un endroit
très spécial.
La maison où je voulais vivre
avec l'homme que j'aimais.
Tu peux voir ça ?
Tu peux te projeter ?
Oui, tu peux quand même le manger.
Vous en avez oublié.
Près de la patte de gauche.
La serrure est cassée.
Merci.
Vous croyez à ces foutaises
que vous vomissez à la radio ?
- Des foutaises ?
- Les anges.
Les anges sont parmi nous.
Les anges font ressortir
nos meilleurs côtés...
En effet, j'y crois.
Vous avez vu ces anges ?
Avec une constance inquiétante.
La constance.
Essentiel, quand on débite
que des conneries.
Charmant.
Vraiment charmant.
Vous avez le droit de le penser,
évidemment.
Qui êtes-vous, déjà ?
Moi ?
Je suis un cadavre ambulant.
Et c'est moi
qui raconte des conneries ?
C'est la vérité. Je suis morte.
Morte et enterrée.
Crashée puis calcinée sur un bûcher.
Tenez.
J'ai récupéré ça sur mon corps,
du moins ce qu'il en restait, sur Terre.
Prenez-les.
Vous étiez un scientifique.
Faites des tests.
Sortez le détecteur de Cylons,
faites ce qu'il y a à faire,
car j'y comprends rien.
Tout ce que je sais,
c'est que je suis pas un ange.
On l'a branché au réseau principal.
Pour l'aider à relancer
son réseau neuronal.
En d'autres termes,
vous changez sa batterie.
Laissez-moi deviner.
Ça n'a pas marché pour vous.
- Faites une pause.
- On doit surveiller...
Je voudrais un moment avec mon mari,
si vous permettez.
C'est drôle, tu sais...
Je me souviens...
quand je t'ai dit
que si t'étais un Cylon,
je te mettrais
une balle dans la tête.
Je me suis fait griller sur le poteau
et je veux qu'une chose, te ramener.
Humain, Cylon, peu importe.
Je voulais juste que tu reviennes...
Parce que tu es Sam.
Tu es mon Sam.
Et c'est le souvenir
que je garderai.
La neuroanatomie de la peur
et de la foi ont des voies afférentes.
Jetez une pièce.
La pression vasculaire montre la menace.
Le libre arbitre fuit le marais
de la peur. N'aie pas peur du mot.
Tu es le messager de la mort.
Tu les mèneras à leur fin.
Fin de ligne.
Nouvelle directive.
Reprenez les fonctions.
"Et j'ai marché,
comme le flic battu que j'étais.
"Quand on marche,
on voit les choses différemment.
"Mais quand quelque chose
n'est pas à sa place, on le voit.
"Les yeux d'un flic voient tout,
"et ces yeux,
"ils n'ont pas pu me les prendre."
Quoi ?
Ouvre à la page 61.
Ne t'en fais pas.
Cottle ne dira rien.
C'est médicinal.
J'arrive pas à croire
que tu l'aies gardé.
Tu te souviens de ce jour ?
Oui.
Sur New Caprica.
La cérémonie de fondation de Baltar.
On a parlé et parlé.
D'un tas de choses.
Tu sais à quoi je pense ?
- Donne-moi un indice.
- Les montagnes.
Un torrent qui se jette
dans un petit lac.
De l'eau si limpide
qu'on voit le fond.
Ta cabane.
Celle que tu voulais construire.
C'est incroyable
que j'y pense encore autant.
Parfois je me demande
ce qu'est un foyer.
Est-ce un lieu existant,
ou le désir de quelque chose,
une association d'idées ?
J'ai passé toute ma vie sur Caprica.
Je suis née dans une maison, puis...
j'ai déménagé dans une autre.
Et là...
Ça.
Et maintenant,
je ne crois pas...
que je me sois vraiment
sentie chez moi
avant ces derniers mois,
ici, avec toi.
Je sais que tu aimes ce vaisseau.
Probablement plus que moi.
Bill, si tu ne nous sors pas
de ce vaisseau,
tu pourrais bien nous perdre
tous les deux en même temps.
Pourquoi ne pas nous donner
une chance ?
Un système fermé
ne peut pas se renouveler.
La connaissance seule
est une base faible.
Ça fait ça dans tout le vaisseau.
Surtensions, variations de température,
et vous me dites que c'est lui ?
On ignorait qu'il pouvait faire ça.
Comment il infiltre le vaisseau ?
Je croyais qu'on avait des pare-feu.
Oui, c'est pourquoi
il n'a pas accédé aux ordinateurs.
La résine organique injectée
dans la superstructure
contient des éléments inducteurs,
comme des fibres nerveuses.
Il a dû s'y connecter,
et grâce à elles,
au circuit électrique
dans les cloisons du Galactica.
Et les FTL améliorés
avec votre technologie ?
Ils sont vulnérables ?
- En théorie.
- En théorie,
il pourrait faire sauter le vaisseau
s'il le voulait, comme le vôtre.
Fin de ligne.
Début de la réintégration...
Manquait plus que ça.
Débranchez-le.
Allez.
Début de la réintégration
des sous-programmes.
Il y a un trou dans mon seau
Chère Élise, chère Élise
La longue-vue renvoie
des modèles et des répétitions.
Tout ceci est déjà arrivé.
Et se produira encore.
Sacré soulagement.
- Cavil a déplacé la Colonie.
- Quand ?
Vu l'énergie résiduelle,
il y a 5 mois environ.
Avant la guerre civile.
Et vous ne savez pas
où il l'a déplacée ?
Non.
Alors je vous laisse.
Tout ce que tu peux imaginer ici
peut devenir réalité.
Tu veux voir une pièce spéciale ?
Celle où je voulais
que vive ma fille ?
Amiral.
Je peux vous accompagner ?
Je vais aux funérailles.
Je comprendrais
que vous ne veniez pas.
J'aimerais être autorisé
à prendre un Raptor
pour aller chercher ma fille.
Je sais qu'Athena
acceptera de piloter et...
J'ai déjà envoyé
une mission de reconnaissance.
Elle est revenue.
- Vraiment ?
- On cherchait un complexe
où Boomer aurait pu emmener Hera.
Mais il n'était plus là.
Amiral,
donnez-moi un Raptor.
- Je pourrais trouver quelque chose.
- Elle est partie.
J'ai perdu un fils,
vous, votre fille.
Je n'approuverai pas
une mission suicide.
Faites-vous une raison.
Me faire une raison ?
C'est vous qui me dites ça ?
Vous qui faites repeindre les trous ?
Ce vaisseau est mort !
Mais ma fille est peut-être en vie.
Je comprends votre douleur,
capitaine,
mais ne me donnez pas de leçon.
Vous êtes sous mes ordres.
C'est compris ?
Désolé.
Je suis désolé.
Un Raptor, amiral.
C'est peut-être
une mission suicide...
mais donnez-moi une chance d'agir.
Je vous en prie.
Pour ceux qui sont tombés
par le passé,
et pour ceux qui sont tombés
aujourd'hui,
- Ils ont donné leur vie...
- rappelons-nous...
- pour sauver ce vaisseau.
- qu'il est un plus grand dessein.
Tout autant que les soldats morts...
Nous déplorons la perte de nos amis.
- Divin Père...
- Soyons bien conscients...
- donne-nous la force...
- de notre sacrifice en ce jour...
- la sagesse...
- des personnes...
- et surtout, ta bénédiction...
- d'un immense courage.
- même infime.
- Car c'est ce que nous sommes,
des voyageurs traversant les cieux,
en quête de bénédiction.
- Ainsi soit-il !
- Ainsi soit-il !
Présentez armes !
Rompez.
Écoutez.
La mort n'est pas la fin.
Et je ne parle pas
de la résurrection cylon.
Je parle du don
de la vie éternelle,
qui nous est offert à tous.
Oui,
même aux plus mauvais d'entre nous.
Tout ce qu'il nous faut,
c'est le courage
d'affronter la mort
quand elle nous appelle,
et même l'étreindre.
Alors seulement,
nous saurons comment la vaincre,
tout comme l'un de nous l'a déjà
vaincue.
L'un de nous, ici même
est la preuve vivante
qu'il y a une vie
après la mort.
Le sang
sur ces plaques
provient de tissus nécrosés.
C'est-à-dire d'un cadavre.
L'analyse ADN
montre avec certitude
qu'il s'agit
du capitaine Kara Thrace.
Je vous avais dit
que les anges étaient parmi nous.
Me croirez-vous enfin ?
Elle les a ramassées
sur sa propre dépouille.
Sur Terre,
- enterrées avec ses os...
- Ça suffit !
- Demandez-lui !
- Je vais vous mettre aux arrêts !
Elle n'est pas cylon !
Nous les connaissons déjà tous !
Demandez-lui ! Elle ne niera pas !
Rompez !
Évacuez le pont, immédiatement !
Kara ?
Que fais-tu ?
Écoute-moi.
Je m'en fous. Complètement.
On est tous passés
par des trucs dingues.
Peu importe
ce que tu penses avoir vu.
J'ai vu ton Viper exploser.
Je m'en fous.
Je suis là. Toi aussi.
C'est tout ce qui compte.
À plus tard...
Kara Thrace.
- Tout s'est bien passé, on dirait ?
- Oui.
Dommage
que j'aie raté la tête d'Ellen
quand elle a compris
qu'on l'avait bernée.
Tu as bien travaillé. Repose-toi.
On s'occupe de la suite.
Ne t'inquiète pas.
On s'en occupera bien.
Boomer, non, Boomer !
Ça va aller.
Tu auras bientôt
plein de camarades de jeu.
Je sais que tu m'entends, Sam,
et même que tu comprends,
d'une certaine manière.
L'ancienne Kara
est morte et enterrée,
tout comme l'ancien Sam.
J'ai mis du temps à l'accepter.
Ce qui nous amène
à la question essentielle :
pourquoi suis-je ici ?
Ça doit avoir un rapport
avec la musique.
Il y a une explication.
Une explication...
que je ne vois pas,
mais je pense que tu le peux.
Alors, on va rester dans cette pièce
jusqu'à ce qu'on trouve.
Parle-moi, Sam.
Nouvelle directive.
Tu voulais me voir ?
J'ai pris une décision.
Parfait.
Il était temps de virer
ces techniciens toaster.
- Pour le bien qu'ils ont fait !
- En fait,
je mets fin
aux réparations du vaisseau.
Je veux qu'on commence
à désarmer le Galactica.
Qu'on démonte les armes
et les équipements.
On commencera à évacuer les civils
dès demain.
L'équipage et le matériel
doivent être transférés
- avant la fin de la semaine.
- Quoi ?
Nous abandonnons le vaisseau, Tigh.
Non.
Tu peux pas faire ça.
Il le faut, Saul.
Il est mourant,
et tu le sais bien.
En tant que second,
je peux pas te laisser faire ça.
Tu m'as jamais fait défaut, Saul.
Je peux pas te reprocher...
ce que tu es.
Surtout parce que...
tu es aussi mon meilleur ami
et mon meilleur officier.
Ce vaisseau n'a jamais failli.
On va lui donner
la fin qu'il mérite.
On va vraiment le faire ?
C'était un sacré vaisseau.
Le meilleur.
Au Galactica,
le meilleur vaisseau de la flotte.
Au Galactica.
<i>Previously on </i>
Battlestar Galactica...
What am I?
A ghost, a demon?
You're asking the wrong guy.
I'm just a piano player.
- That for me?
- Here.
Holy crap.
Sam!
- There's a lot still going on in there.
- And there is nothing
to indicate that's he's having
any kind of conscious thought.
What if we could link him
to the data stream? Like our hybrids?
We have to figure out
a contingency plan for the ship now.
You have to face the fact
that you're gonna lose her.
Boomer's loose.
She's got my frakkin' kid!
Get on the horn to CIC
and alert the Admiral.
- Sir, Boomer's spooling to jump.
- If she jumps,
the spatial disruption
could tear Galactica's guts out.
What have you been bitching about?
It's not our fault the resin
won't bond with your alloys.
In other words, it's our fault that
this goop of yours isn't doing crap,
except making this place
smell like the inside of a latrine.
Really? I thought that was you.
Lady, you work on your side,
and I'll work on mine!
Come on.
Come on, not with this guy. Not now.
- Stop your bitching!
- Not now.
- Fine! Fine!
- Come on, let's go.
If John's plan all along was
to steal Hera so he could study her...
Study her? They're gonna dissect her
like a lab rat and we all know it.
If he wants to try to determine
what made her
a successful human/Cylon hybrid,
he'll take her to the Colony.
The Colony?
I guess you could call it home.
It's where we and the Centurions
went after the first war,
once we convinced them
to abandon their own experiments
with evolution in exchange
for resurrection technology.
She knows where it is.
So you would have the Galactica
jump into a Cylon's hornets' nest,
risk everything,
for one solitary, single child.
- Is that what you're telling me?
- She's not just any child.
With Caprica Six's miscarriage,
Hera is our people's only hope
of avoiding eventual extinction.
She may be our only hope, too.
I just ex...
We just experienced
something remarkable.
Hera wrote the notes to a song.
A song that my father used to play to me
when I was a child.
The same song that switched us on
when we were in that nebula.
The same song that led us to Earth.
Something is happening here,
something greater than all of us,
and that little girl
is in the middle of it.
She's the key, sir.
In other words, it's our destiny
to go after her, right?
Wrong.
I've had it up to here with destiny,
prophecy,
with God or the Gods.
Look where it's left us.
The ass end of nowhere,
nearly half of our people are gone,
Earth, a worthless cinder,
and I can't even
walk down the halls of my ship
without wondering if I'm gonna catch
a bullet for getting us into this mess.
We're alive, Bill.
Four years ago,
I wouldn't have taken odds on that.
At least give us a recon bird.
We can see what we're up against.
Make it a heavy Raider.
I don't want Helo and Athena
to find out about this.
Look at me.
Look at me.
Look at me.
You hate me, don't you?
Say it.
Say it.
Gods frakkin' damn it.
Hera?
Hera!
Hera!
Bill, I've been having
that dream again.
Help me!
Grab him!
Get him!
Grab the door!
Lock it!
Lock it!
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA
Season 4 - Episode 18
Subtitles
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-
Got internal bleeding, Doc.
Taking her to surgery.
- Right. I hope we don't lose power.
- What's the tally?
61 dead or missing so far,
including 26 of theirs.
The Leobens are calling it
the proverbial straw.
Say we've got five more jumps, max.
After that, there's a 90% chance
of tearing her in half.
I don't want to hear
that you are 90% sure of anything.
You come back when you are 100% sure,
you got that?
- Go take care of your injuries.
- Yes, sir.
That frakkin' Cylon rep, Sonja,
wanted to know
when you'd be transferring your flag.
Transferring to her baseship?
That'll be the frakkin' day.
That's exactly what I said.
I'll get on on top
of this repair detail,
we'll straighten her out.
Must be tough saying to good-bye
to both of your women at once.
You must feel like
we're abandoning you.
No one's going anywhere.
And neither one of my women
are dying.
They just need a little
more care and attention.
Hera.
Admiral Adama
will be forced to abandon Galactica.
- Yes.
- At which point,
the Cylon baseship
will be our sole means of defense.
Under the Admiral's command,
augmented by Galactica's pilots,
planes, and military personnel
as it has always been.
Mr. Adama,
but it sure seems like
we're putting a lot of power
into the hands of some people...
And I use the term loosely...
Who not so long ago were doing
their damndest to wipe us out!
- And your concerns are noted.
- As you all know...
Let me speak!
As you all know, we agreed to accept
Admiral Adama's military authority
in return for a seat
on this council.
- We intend to abide by that promise.
- Speaking of promises,
I have been complaining about air
quality aboard Hitei Kan from day one.
I am submitting my requisition now
for Galactica's CO˛
and particulate scrubbers.
- Excuse me?
- As long as we get the FTLs.
Our last emergency jump,
it took us six minutes to spin up!
- Wait a minute.
- Obviously we will have to do
a complete inventory
of Galactica's equipment.
Maybe even a lottery
in order to ensure
an equitable distribution
of all the equipment.
Now listen to me
for one Gods damn minute!
No one removes so much as one bolt
from this Battlestar,
not until the Admiral
tells us we can.
Really!
What does Gaius Baltar
say about that?
Gaius Baltar?
<i>Angels.</i>
<i>Angels, I hear you say?</i>
<i>I don't believe
that angels appear to you</i>
<i>in some mystical, spectral form.</i>
<i>Angels take the guise</i>
<i>of those who are nearest
and dearest to you,</i>
<i>those who can understand your doubts</i>
<i>and your trials,</i>
<i>and steer you back
on the road to salvation.</i>
<i>I believe in these angels</i>
because I see them.
Wherever you are in the fleet,
this is Gaius Baltar
wishing you a beautiful day.
Excuse me.
Caprica? Caprica Six!
It's...
It's good to...
Listen, I heard about...
your loss,
and I want to offer you
my condolences,
- tell you how truly sorry I am.
- Thank you, Gaius.
I see...
I see you've got your...
- If you need any more, we have got...
- I'm fine.
I'm also not
unaware of your current situation.
If you need a place to stay...
- I have no desire to join your harem.
- No, No.
That's not what I...
That's not what...
We are trying to make a difference
within the fleet.
You haven't changed,
Gaius, not really.
I have.
- She wants to talk to you.
- Me?
She's dying.
Could you just take a few minutes
out of your busy schedule
and be with her.
Thank you.
Thank me for what?
For the privilege
of finally being able to meet
my father before I die.
You shouldn't be thanking me.
I spent most of my life
trying to kill your kind.
Too much confusion.
I want my mommy.
I want my mommy.
I want my mommy.
Take me home.
It's too bad they never upgraded
the FTL on this relic,
but if you think I'm gonna
put up with your sniveling
and your whining for another
dozen jumps, guess again!
I want my mommy!
Take me home!
Fine!
Let's see if you can cry
in your sleep.
It might be a long snooze, too,
because these
don't come in kiddy doses.
Give me your arm!
You okay?
Saul, it's Hera.
We're got to do more.
I got him to send out
a recon mission.
Yeah, a recon mission.
Our people's future is at stake and
you got him to send out a recon mission.
"Our people".
That's right, Saul.
Thank Gods. Oh, frak.
Empty!
You want to know who my people are,
lady? The ones on this ship.
The ones I fought with
and bled with.
The Old Man, this crew,
they're my family.
The only family I've known,
and the only one I care to.
You're a pip.
You really are.
"Old man".
Old compared to who?
You were my husband 2,000 years
before you even met Bill Adama.
2,000 years, that's a number.
That's what it means to me.
It's nothing.
But that man's friendship...
Oh, frak!
- You're a Cylon, Saul.
- Yeah.
Whether you remember
that life or not,
at least you must understand
what we were trying to do.
We wanted to end the cycle of war
between man and machine.
That was a bust.
Yes, we failed,
but we have a second chance now.
Hera.
Without her,
our children are going
to die off one by one,
just like they're dying
right now in Cottle's sickbay.
I had a child.
He died.
You're wrong, Saul.
You had millions.
Come on, you've got to be hungry.
Eat this.
Do you know what I do sometimes
when I'm sad?
I go to this special place.
A house where I wanted to live
with a man that I loved.
You can see this?
You can project?
Yeah, you can still eat it.
Missed a spot.
By your left sideburn.
The latch was busted.
Thank you.
So...
Do you really believe all that bilge
you were spewing on the wireless?
- Bilge?
- Angels.
The angels walking among us.
The angels that bring out
our better nature, bla bla bla...
I do, as a matter of fact.
And you've seen
these angels for yourself?
With alarming regularity.
Regularity.
That must be important
when you're full of crap.
That's charming.
Absolutely charming.
And you are entitled
to your opinion obviously.
Who are you, by the way again?
Me?
I'm a dead chick, that's who.
All right, and I'm full of crap.
No, I mean it. I'm dead,
as in six feet under dead.
Dead, as in crash-landed,
burned to a crisp dead.
Here.
I took these off my body,
what was left of it,
anyway, on Earth.
Take 'em.
You used to be a scientist.
Run some tests.
Pull out the ol' Cylon detector,
do whatever you need to do,
because I have no idea.
The only thing I know for sure...
I'm not an angel.
We tried hooking him up
to the main power grid.
Thought it might help him
reset his neural net.
So in other words,
you tried to jumpstart him like a car.
Let me guess.
It didn't work so well for you.
- Take a break.
- Someone has to monitor...
I'd like a minute alone with my husband.
I'm sure you don't mind.
It's funny, you know? I...
I remember when
I told you that if
I found out you were a Cylon,
I would
put a bullet in your head.
Some frakker beats me to it,
all I can think about is
how I can get you back.
Human, Cylon,
it doesn't seem to matter.
I just wanted you back...
Because you're just Sam.
You are my Sam.
And that's how I'm gonna
remember you...
The neuroanatomy of fear and faith
share common afferent pathways.
Flip a coin.
Increased vascular pressure
marks the threat response.
Free will scuttles in the swamp of fear.
Do not fear the word.
You are the harbinger of death.
You will lead them all to their end.
End of line.
New command. Resume function...
"And so I walked,
like the beat cop I used to be.
"When you walk,
you see things in different ways.
"But when something's out of place,
you notice.
"A cop's eyes always notice,
"and those eyes
"were one thing
they couldn't take away from me."
What?
Open to page 61.
Don't worry.
Cottle won't mind. It's medicinal.
I can't believe you saved this.
Do you remember that day?
Yes.
New Caprica.
Baltar's ground-breaking.
We talked and talked.
About a lot of things.
Guess what I'm thinking
about right now?
Give me a hint.
Mountains.
A stream running into a little lake.
Water so clear
it's like looking through glass.
Your cabin.
The one you wanted to build.
It's amazing how much
I still think about it.
You know, sometimes I wonder
what home is.
Is it an actual place,
or is it some kind
of longing for something,
some kind of connection.
You know,
I spent my whole life on Caprica.
I was born in one house,
and then I...
I moved to another.
And then...
This.
And then now,
I don't think I've...
ever felt truly at home until
these last few months
here with you.
I know you love this ship.
You probably love her more
than you love me.
Bill, if you don't
get us off this ship,
you may lose both of us
at the same time.
Why don't you give us a chance?
A closed system lacks
the ability to renew itself.
Knowledge alone is a poor primer.
This has been happening all
over the ship.
Power surges,
temperature fluctuations,
and now you're telling me
it's been him all along?
We had no idea he had this ability.
How's he hooking into the ship?
I thought all our systems
were firewalled.
Well, they are, which is why
he hasn't accessed your computers.
But the organic resins
we've been injecting
into your super structure
contain inductive elements,
not unlike nerve fibers.
So he must have linked to those
and then through them,
the electrical circuitry
embedded in Galactica's bulkheads.
What about our FTLs,
now that we've upgraded with your tech?
Are they vulnerable?
- Theoretically.
- So, theoretically,
he could jump the ship
if he wanted to just like yours did.
End of line. Begin reintegration...
Great. That's all we need.
Take him off line.
Do it.
Begin reintegration
of command subroutines.
There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza,
dear Liza. There's a hole in the bucket.
The long view returns
patterns and repetitions.
All has happened before
and will happen again...
That's a blessed relief.
- Cavil moved the Colony.
- When?
Judging from the residual
energy readings,
about five months ago.
Just before the civil war.
And you have no idea
where he moved it to?
No.
Then excuse me.
Anything you imagine in here
can be as real as you want it to be.
Do you want to see a special room,
a room where I thought
my daughter would live?
Sir.
Can I walk with you, sir?
I'm going to the funeral.
I understand if you're not going.
I'd like your permission, sir,
to take out a Raptor
to go and look for my daughter.
I'm sure Athena
would be willing to pilot and...
I've already sent out
a recon mission
and they reported back.
- You did?
- We were looking for a facility
where we knew
Boomer would probably take Hera,
but it was no longer there.
Sir,
let me take out that Raptor.
- Maybe I can find something.
- She's gone.
I've lost a son,
and you've lost a daughter.
But I can't condone
a suicide mission.
So let it go.
You want me to let it go?
You're the one who can't let go.
Painting over the holes in this bucket?
This ship is dead!
But my daughter
might still be alive.
I understand your pain, Captain,
but don't lecture me.
You're here to take orders.
Do you understand?
I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm sorry.
One... one Raptor, Admiral.
Maybe it is a suicide mission,
but...
at least give me the chance
to do something.
Please?
For those
that we have lost in the past,
and for those
that we are burying today.
- They gave their lives...
- We must remember...
- to save this ship.
- there is a higher purpose.
Casualties,
as much as any soldier fallen...
... we mourn
the passing of our friends.
- Heavenly father...
- We must understand...
- grant us the strength...
- that what we sacrifice today...
- the wisdom...
- our women and men...
- above all, a measure of acceptance...
- of extreme courage.
- however small.
- Because that is what we are,
voyagers traversing the stars
in search of grace.
- So say we all!
- So say we all!
Present arms!
Dismissed.
Listen to me.
The death is not the end.
And I'm not talking
about Cylon resurrection,
I'm talking about the gift
of eternal life
that is offered
to each and every one of us.
Yes,
even the most flawed amongst us.
All we need is the courage
to face death
when it comes calling for us,
embrace it even.
Only then
will we truly have the ability
to cross over,
as one amongst us here has already
crossed over.
One amongst us here
is living proof that there is life
after death.
The blood
on these dog tags
comes from necrotic flesh.
That means a dead body.
The DNA analysis
is 100% proof positive match
for one Captain Kara Thrace.
I told you there were angels
walking amongst you.
When will you believe me?
She took these
from her own mortal remains
that lie on Earth.
- Even now, interred with her bones...
- That's enough!
- Ask her yourself!
- I will put you in the brig!
She's not a Cylon!
They've already been revealed to us!
Ask her yourself!
She will not deny it!
Dismissed, everyone!
Off the deck now!
Kara?
What are you doing?
Okay, listen to me.
I don't care, all right.
I don't...
We've all been through
some crazy, crazy stuff.
I don't care what you think you saw.
I watched your Viper explode.
Don't care.
I'm here. You're here.
This is all that matters.
Okay.
See you around...
Kara Thrace.
- Everything went smoothly, I take it?
- Yes.
It's a shame I can't be there
to see the expression on Ellen's face
when she realizes how we played her.
You had a hard day's work.
Go get some rest.
We'll take it from here.
Don't worry.
We'll take good care of her.
Boomer, no, Boomer!
There, there.
You'll have all sorts
of new playmates pretty soon.
I know you can hear me, Sam,
just like I know on some level
you'll understand.
The old me is dead and gone,
same as the old you.
Just took me a while to accept it.
Which brings us
to the larger question:
why am I here?
I think it has something to do
with this music,
there's a pattern there,
a pattern that I...
can't see,
but I think that you can.
So we are going to sit in this room
until we figure it out.
Talk to me, Sam.
New command.
You wanted to see me?
I've made some decisions.
Good.
About time you sent
those toaster work crews packing,
for all the good they've done.
Actually,
I'm stopping
all the repairs on the ship.
Put out the orders I want the crew
to start stripping down Galactica,
packing all the weapons and gear.
Gonna start offloading the civilians
by tomorrow.
Full crews and ordinances transferred
- by the end of the week.
- What?
We're abandoning ship, Tigh.
No.
No, you can't do this.
I have to, Saul.
She's dying,
and we both know it.
As your XO, I can't let you do this.
I won't.
You've never let me down, Saul.
I can't blame you for...
being what you are,
especially since
it includes being the finest officer
and friend I've ever had.
This ship never let us down,
so we're gonna send her off
in style.
So we're gonna do this?
She was a grand old lady.
The grandest.
To Galactica,
best ship in the fleet.
To Galactica.
<i>Précédemment dans</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
Si c'est moi, je suis quoi ?
Elle les a ramassées
sur sa propre dépouille.
Le sang sur ces plaques
appartient sans l'ombre d'un doute
au capitaine Kara Thrace.
On l'a branché au réseau principal.
Pour relancer son réseau neuronal.
Ça fait ça dans tout le vaisseau.
Surtensions, variations de température,
et vous me dites que c'est lui ?
Pour moi ?
Hera a écrit les notes
d'un morceau que mon père me jouait
quand j'étais enfant.
Le même qui nous a menés à la Terre.
L'explication m'échappe.
Mais toi, tu devrais comprendre.
Alors, on va rester dans cette pièce
jusqu'à ce qu'on trouve.
- Impossible ! On a dû la voir !
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Boomer a pris Hera à la crèche.
Tu as bien travaillé. Repose-toi.
Ne t'inquiète pas.
On s'en occupera bien.
Si Cavil a prévu de l'enlever
pour l'étudier,
il l'emmènera à la Colonie.
On y a retrouvé les Centurions
après la première guerre.
Nous abandonnons le vaisseau.
Ordonne le démantèlement
du Galactica,
qu'on démonte les armes
et les équipements.
On commencera à évacuer les civils
dès demain.
Équipage et matériel seront transférés
avant la fin de la semaine.
Au Galactica,
le meilleur vaisseau de la flotte.
Au Galactica.

CAPRICA CITY
AVANT SA CHUTE
J'ai commandé deux Battlestars
et trois escorteurs auparavant.
Ne le prends pas comme ça.
Il n'y a pas de quoi être en colère.
On m'a confié des milliards en matériel
et des centaines de vies.
Ça ne te prendra qu'une heure.
Tu sais, parfois,
on n'a pas le choix.
Boire et conduire ?
Je bois,
lui conduit.
Vous aimez
qu'on fasse les choses pour vous.
Plus que les faire moi-même.
Pas vous ?
Non, je préfère éviter
de dépendre des autres.
J'ai moins de chance d'être déçue.
Puisque vous avez accepté
de vous en remettre
à mes mains expertes ce soir,
vous ne serez pas déçue.
Je trinque à cette idée.
Vous pouvez...
Vous pouvez m'appeler Gaius,
si vous voulez.
C'est dingue,
mais j'ai oublié votre nom.
Lui-même.
Comment allez-vous ?
Quoi ?
Bon sang. C'est arrivé quand ?
Écoutez...
Je suis vraiment navré.
Restez sur place,
j'arrive aussi vite que possible...
Je vous en prie. Attendez-moi.
Vous devez...
Vous ne pouvez pas...
Vous m'attendez sur place
ou je vous attaque pour abandon.
J'hésiterai pas.
Je ne sais pas si ça va être long.
Attendez-moi.
J'arrive tout de suite.
- Embrasse Sydney de ma part !
- Promis ! Bye.
Super fête.
Par les Dieux.
C'était génial.
Il faut nettoyer un peu.
Arrête de faire le ménage.
- Juste un peu.
- Il faut boire la dernière bouteille.
- Tu m'as promis de finir le champagne.
- D'accord.
On a beaucoup bu.
- Eux, oui.
- C'est clair.
Et moi ?
La future maman n'a que les cadeaux.
- Rien qu'une goutte.
- Une goutte ?
D'accord.
- Une petite.
- Petite.
Vas-y.
Ça suffit.
Bon sang.
C'était très sympa, Laura. Merci.
C'est le moins que je puisse faire
pour ma petite soeur.
Je croyais
que c'était moi ta petite soeur.
Tu es ma toute petite soeur.
Énorme.
Et cette fille
qui accompagnait Mlle Anderson ?
- Pourquoi elle l'a amenée ?
- C'était qui ?
Je sais pas.
Mais il en faut toujours une.
Merde. Il est en avance.
Une seconde !
J'arrive !
- Tu dois être Lee.
- Bonjour, je...
Moi, c'est Kara. Entre.
Merci beaucoup, fallait pas.
Je te débarrasse.
Je prends un vase.
Zak !
Chouette appart.
C'est un trou à rats,
mais c'est pas cher.
Non. C'est...
Ça a du cachet.
Tu mens très mal.
On devrait jouer aux cartes.
- Je me débrouille.
- J'en doute pas.
- Tu t'enlaidis de jour en jour.
- Le voilà.
La forme ?
Tu as rencontré ma meilleure moitié.
Elle est à moi. Pas touche.
Un voleur de copine, le frérot.
Sympa !
J'ai jamais volé de copine.
- Il ment très mal.
- J'avais déjà remarqué.
Zak, va chercher à boire.
- Le dîner est bientôt prêt.
- Oui, chef.
Je suis confus. C'était une erreur.
Me faire poignarder
n'est pas dans mon contrat.
Elle me vole quand je dors.
Personne ne te vole,
papa, d'accord ?
Tais-toi,
t'en as assez fait comme ça.
Je démissionne. Une chance
que j'appelle pas les flics.
En effet, Barbara, merci.
Je vous paierai le double.
Le triple.
- Vous deviez rester dans la voiture.
- C'est ta nouvelle poule ?
Ça te regarde pas.
Barbara, j'ai 500 cubits... 1 000.
1 000 putains de cubits
pour rester cette nuit !
Je retire les couteaux.
Il mangera de la soupe.
Pour toujours.
Restez une nuit !
Et toi, ma chérie ?
Je parie que tu prends
beaucoup plus cher.
Tu la fermes.
Arrête d'être aussi répugnant.
C'est votre père.
On dirait pas.
Gaius a honte de sa famille.
- J'avais pas besoin de ça.
- Même de son accent.
Ce pauvre con a changé son accent.
Incroyable, non ?
C'est la 3e infirmière de suite.
La 3e infirmière.
Tu sais combien ça me coûte ?
Combien ça coûte...
Y a que ça qui compte.
Je l'ai pas élevé comme ça.
Je vous le dis.
Mais il s'en fiche.
Il veut pas entendre parler
de la vie à la ferme
- et de faire sa besogne quotidienne.
- D'accord. Ça suffit !
Tais-toi !
Tu la fermes !
Je veux plus entendre
ton couplet du héros prolétaire.
Regarde-toi !
Regarde la chemise que j'ai achetée.
Tu baves dessus, t'en prends pas soin.
Je vais te faire la liste, papa.
Tu es un vieux con odieux,
méchant et irascible.
Tu as de la chance
de ne pas être à la rue.
Le grand homme insulte son père.
Tu te sens plus important ?
- Je devrais peut-être...
- Rester dans la voiture,
comme je vous l'avais demandé.
Je suis désolé,
mais vous devez partir.
Le chauffeur pourra
vous ramener chez vous.
Je vais passer cette charmante soirée
avec mon père.
Bonne nuit.
Bonjour, je suis l'agent Stéphanie
et voici l'agent Shawn
de la police de Caprica City.
Êtes-vous Laura Roslin ?
Oui.
Nous devons vous parler.
Pouvons-nous entrer ?
Je vous en prie.
Nous sommes navrés,
mais il y a eu un terrible accident.
Vos soeurs et votre père
ont été tués cette nuit.
Nous n'avons identifié les corps
qu'il y a quelques heures.
Le chauffeur de l'autre véhicule
est dans un état stable.
Les analyses préliminaires indiquent
qu'il était en état d'ivresse
quand il a percuté la voiture
de votre père et de vos soeurs.
Merci.
Vous pouvez vous retirer.
Toutes nos condoléances.
Je ne sais pas ce qu'elle fait.
Il y a tant de matériel à traiter.
On dirait qu'on réforme 10 Battlestars.
- Excusez-moi.
- Une seconde.
Dites aux capitaines
qu'ils demandent trop. Renvoyez-les.
- Je peux vous parler ?
- Juste une seconde.
- Oui, technicien ?
- Je sais que c'est pas votre problème,
mais ils veulent enlever
les catapultes des tubes.
Les civils leur ont trouvé un usage.
C'est comme si
on lui arrachait le coeur.
Le rôle d'un Battlestar,
c'est de lancer des Vipers.
Je vous comprends.
Je tiens aussi à ce vaisseau.
Dites à vos hommes d'enlever
les catapultes en dernier.
On éteindra la lumière et on laissera
ce vieux navire mourir en paix.
À vos ordres.
Depuis ton petit numéro,
l'opinion a basculé
ce qui nous donne la majorité
sur plus de la moitié des vaisseaux.
Personne d'autre ne peut prétendre
à un tel pouvoir politique.
C'est le moment, Gaius.
Elle a raison, Gaius.
La fin approche.
Le chapitre final de l'Humanité
va s'écrire et toi,
tu en seras l'auteur.
Gaius, tu m'as écoutée ?
On y est.
On y est, Gaius.
Tu veux...
prendre un verre avant de...
Que faites-vous ici ?
Comment êtes-vous entrée ?
- Je dois partir ?
- Tu dois monter les escaliers,
tourner à gauche,
aller dans la chambre,
et te préparer.
Vous êtes entrée chez moi
par effraction.
Vous feriez mieux de partir
avant que j'appelle la police.
Bien, si vous voulez jouer à ça.
J'appelle la police.
La police, je vous prie.
J'ai trouvé un foyer
pour votre père.
Quoi ?
Le Regency.
Près des quais.
C'est très chic.
Soins à plein temps, activités sociales,
équipe médicale.
Et le meilleur...
Ils encouragent leurs résidents
à jardiner et à cultiver.
Julius redeviendra fermier.
Le personnel déménage
ses affaires en ce moment même.
Elles seront disposées dans sa chambre
comme dans son appartement.
Il l'adore.
Il adore ?
Je lui ai montré l'endroit.
Votre père est
un homme très complexe,
mais il y a des choses simples
qui le rendent très heureux.
La dernière fois que je l'ai vu,
il avait l'air heureux.
Désolé, monsieur.
Comme je le disais,
le Patron pilotera le dernier Viper
qui quittera le vaisseau.
Dites aux équipes
de laisser un tube intact,
- prêt pour un lancement manuel.
- Oui, colonel.
C'est pas comme ça
que vous deviendrez amiral.
Elles sont toutes pareilles.
<i>Non, elles sont différentes.</i>
<i>Tu le sais.</i>
Ce que tu ressentais pour Boomer,
c'était différent.
Ça explique ce que tu as fait.
<i>Je l'ai fait
parce que je suis un imbécile.</i>
<i>Un imbécile de 2 000 ans
incapable de retenir la leçon.</i>
Les machines ne sont pas des gens,
mais juste des machines.
<i>Ma femme,</i>
<i>Athena,</i>
<i>c'est une personne.</i>
<i>C'est une poupée gonflable.
Comme les autres.</i>
<i>Athena, Sharon, Boomer.
Quel que soit leur nom, c'est les mêmes.</i>
C'est les mêmes,
car on les a créées ainsi.
<i>C'est pas de ta faute,
mais elles sont pas fiables.</i>
<i>Aucune ne l'est.</i>
Des points.
Encore et encore des points.
- Elle a vraiment du talent.
- Elle ne mange rien.
On devrait la mettre sous perfusion,
qu'elle reprenne des forces
avant les tests.
- Elle veut sa mère.
- Elle ne peut pas l'avoir maintenant.
Désolé, j'ai oublié d'être mielleux
et doux en parlant de l'enfant.
C'est un enfant et elle a peur.
C'est une curiosité
mi-humaine, mi-machine
qui détient la clé de notre avenir
dans son code génétique.
On la branche et on la prépare.
Frak.
- J'ai rien dit, OK ?
- Je vous aide.
- Ce sont...
- Les pilotes du mur commémoratif.
On voulait les emmener,
qu'ils ne restent pas avec les autres.
- Les autres.
- Il reste plein de photos.
Plus personne ne sait qui ils sont.
Sans doute des proches
de ceux du Galactica
qu'on a perdus en chemin.
Allez-y.
Vous en tiendrez compte ?
Quand ?
Vous ne m'avez même pas écouté.
Ça n'a même pas besoin d'être moi.
Les miens doivent être représentés
au gouvernement.
Je parle de la vie et du bien-être
de milliers de gens dans la flotte.
Vous y pensiez
en révélant le secret de Starbuck ?
Au bien-être de milliers de gens ?
Ou au bénéfice politique
de Gaius Baltar, une fois encore ?
C'est de ça qu'il s'agit ?
Faut-il toujours tout ramener
à vos sentiments pour Kara Thrace ?
Écoutez, M. Adama.
Je ne demande
qu'une discussion sérieuse.
S'il vous plaît.
Cinq minutes.
Je reviens dans cinq minutes.
Tu penses qu'il y a un sens caché
dans ces notes.
Je sais pas.
Je tâtonne, surtout.
Je cherche une trame.
Je pensais qu'en attribuant
des chiffres aux notes...
Je sais pas.
Ce qu'a dit Baltar l'autre jour,
c'est vrai ?
J'ai trouvé mon corps
et je l'ai incinéré, sur Terre.
Je sais pas ce que je suis.
J'ai une question pour lui.
Tu sais le brancher ?
Je sais ce que tu es.
Tu es ma fille.
Ne l'oublie pas.
On vous imagine bientôt au panthéon,
mais vous n'avez rien gagné
et c'est une saison de transition
pour les C-Bucks.
Si vous ne remportez pas la coupe
avant votre retraite,
votre carrière
sera-t-elle inachevée ?
En fait, j'essaie surtout
d'être plus fort
et d'aider l'équipe comme je peux.
Vous voulez la vérité ?
Je me moque des stats, de la coupe,
du trophée et de tout ça.
En fait, même le jeu
ne compte pas vraiment pour moi.
Ce qui compte pour moi, c'est...
le lancer parfait.
La réception parfaite,
le blocage parfait.
La perfection.
C'est de ça qu'il s'agit.
De ces moments...
où l'on ressent
la perfection de la création.
La beauté de la physique,
les merveilles des mathématiques,
l'exaltation de l'action
et de la réaction.
C'est à ce genre de perfection
que je veux être associé.
Vrilles et virages.
Angles et courbes.
L'ombre des rêves presque oubliés.
Glisse sur les chaînes de la Terre
et touche le visage de la perfection.
Un visage parfait.
Virage parfait.
Trouve un monde parfait pour la fin
de Kara Thrace. Fin de ligne.
Il dit beaucoup de choses.
Allez-y, demandez-lui.
Fais-le.
Oublions que vous êtes
le fils de l'amiral.
La ferme.
Venez-en au fait.
Vous avez cinq minutes.
Le Galactica a été plus
que notre ange gardien.
Nous avons déversé nos espoirs
et nos rêves dans ce vaisseau.
Quand il ne sera plus,
quand notre sécurité
ne proviendra plus
de la vision de cette énorme masse
volant à proximité,
cette vie sera terminée
et une nouvelle aura débuté.
Une nouvelle vie
qui nécessite
un autre mode de pensée.
Je suis prêt à faire
tout mon possible.
Tout mon possible
pour que cette vie soit meilleure.
Je demande seulement que les miens
soient représentés au gouvernement.
Je représente des milliers de gens.
Ils méritent le droit de vote
au même titre que les autres.
Il ne s'agit pas de moi
et de mon pouvoir personnel.
Allons, Lee.
C'est logique.
Vous savez que c'est
la chose à faire.
Je sais une chose.
Depuis que je vous connais,
je ne vous ai jamais vu altruiste.
D'accord.
Je ne vous ai jamais vu agir
autrement que dans l'intérêt
de Gaius Baltar.
Je ne vous serrerai pas la main.
Et je ne nommerai ni vous,
ni l'un des vôtres au gouvernement.
D'accord.
Ça se résume à ça.
Les miens ne seront pas représentés
parce que je n'ai pas réussi
le test d'altruisme de Lee Adama.
J'ai pas été un vrai petit saint.
Vous avez échoué
au test de Gaius Baltar.
Regardez-moi dans les yeux
et racontez-moi
un authentique acte héroïque
qui n'ait pas été dans votre intérêt.
Allez-y !
Je suis prêt à vous croire.
Vous avez raison.
Je n'y croirais pas moi même.
Bordel de merde.
Je te mets au défi.
T'es même pas cap.
Fous le camp !
Allez !
Bravo !
Frak.
Piaf à la con.
Votre attention.
Vous savez tous
qu'une enfant a été enlevée récemment.
Je pensais qu'une mission de sauvetage
était impossible.
J'avais tort.
Il n'a pas donné
ses sources, mais...
Starbuck était là,
il a dû parler à Anders.
Je sais, ça fait flipper.
Il pensait qu'un sauvetage
était impossible
parce qu'il ignorait
où on la retenait.
Mais ça a dû changer,
parce que maintenant,
il sait où on la retient.
Savoir où se trouve la Colonie
ne suffit pas pour la faire s'évader.
C'est de la folie.
Tu le sais, non ?
Hera a une destinée
qui transcende le présent.
Elle a un rôle à remplir,
comme nous.
Alors, nous y allons tous les cinq.
Tu décides à notre place,
maintenant ?
Tu viendras, Tory.
Tu ne pourrais jamais rester seule.
La mission s'effectuera
sur la base du volontariat.
Tout homme ou femme
de plus de 15 ans.
Et l'amiral accepte aussi
d'anciens officiers et techniciens
incarcérés après la mutinerie.
Oui, ce sera tout.
Chacun doit faire son propre choix
et le faire en personne.
Le Patron vous attend
sur le hangar de pont.
Équipe réduite jusqu'à votre retour.
Les hommes de quart se présenteront
aux quartiers de l'amiral
pour se déclarer en personne.
Et que ça saute.
- Vous avez décidé ?
- Pas vraiment.
Prenez votre temps.
On en a bien pour quatre minutes.
Ça y est.
On part à sa recherche.
Du moins ce qu'il en reste.
Cavil a dû la découper
- en un millier d'échantillons.
- Arrête.
Arrête un peu, d'accord ?
Elle est encore en vie.
Elle est là, quelque part.
On va la retrouver.
Et tout va s'arranger.
Ça va pas s'arranger, Karl.
Tu te trompes.
Tu te trompes.
Je sais que ça fait trois mois.
Je le sais.
Mais si, je sors. Je te jure.
Promis.
Non, je ne prendrai pas part
à la campagne présidentielle d'Adar.
Je m'en fiche.
Parce que je n'aime pas la politique
et qu'une campagne nationale
est tout simplement...
Par les Dieux,
tu es coriace.
Je te propose un marché.
Je sors avec un homme
si tu arrêtes de m'embêter
avec cette campagne.
Il est jeune ?
Je sais.
Marché conclu.
Et comment s'appelle
cet homme parfait ?
Sean. J'aime bien ce nom.
Sean comment ?
Sean Allison ?
Ça me dit quelque chose.
D'accord, salut.
Personne ne doit se sentir contraint
de participer à cette mission,
en aucun cas.
C'est une décision
que j'ai prise pour moi-même.
S'il s'avère
qu'il n'y a pas assez de personnel
pour manoeuvrer le Galactica,
je mènerai un assaut de Raptors
avec tous ceux
qui sont prêts à me rejoindre.
Ne vous faites aucune illusion !
Il est fort probable que ce soit
un aller simple.
Alors, ne vous portez pas volontaire
par sympathie
ou par compassion.
Une ligne divise ce pont.
Volontaires,
assemblez-vous à tribord !
Les autres,
à bâbord.
Faites votre choix.
Doc.
La flotte ne peut pas se permettre
de perdre un médecin.
Retourne là-bas, Sherman.
Et merci.
Comme si t'avais mieux à faire.
Excusez-moi.
Merci.
Vous ne pensiez tout de même pas
décoller sans moi, amiral ?
Ça ne m'a jamais effleuré,
madame la présidente.
RAPTOR 279
MISSION DE RECONNAISSANCE
Saut effectué. Frak !
- Trace-nous un chemin pour dégager.
- Ça marche.
<i>Normal, ce Cylon lobotomisé
nous envoie dans un champ d'astéroïdes.</i>
Les choses ne changent jamais.
Une mission de reconnaissance
où les mecs doivent risquer leur peau ?
- Envoyez Racetrack et Skulls.
- C'est mieux que croupir au trou.
Le dradis a détecté un truc.
Bordel, on est juste au-dessus
d'une singularité.
Un trou noir ? Où ça ?
738 inclinaison 882.
On glisse déjà vers lui.
Fais chauffer le FTL. On se barre.
Putain de merde !
- Quoi ?
- Tu vas jamais le croire.
Selon les coordonnées de Sam,
on a déterminé
que la colonie cylon est située ici.
C'est à portée de saut,
mais il y a un piège.
C'est au milieu du disque d'accrétion
d'une singularité nue.
Position de défense stratégique.
La colonie est aspirée
par le puits gravitationnel,
- mais elle reste en orbite.
- Comment on fait ?
Regardez ces débris qui flottent.
On ne pourra pas se diriger.
Les courants sont trop forts.
Le vaisseau serait déchiqueté
avant d'être assez près.
Mais un point de saut existe.
Leurs vaisseaux-mères y passent.
On a eu de la chance.
Deux vaisseaux-mères ont sauté
pendant que le Raptor
prenait des photos.
Voici notre seule place de parking.
Juste au-dessus
de ce putain de truc.
- À moins d'un click, on pense.
- Un click ?
À bout portant.
Et tu peux être sûr
que toutes les armes de la Colonie
seront braquées
sur votre "place de parking".
C'est ce que je ferais.
Ne laisser qu'un seul accès
et rendre les portes
infranchissables.
Très bien.
Mettons-nous au boulot.

Battlestar Galactica...
If that's me, then what am I?
She took these
from her own mortal remains.
The blood on these dog tags
is 100% proof positive match
for one Kara Thrace.
We tried hooking him up
to the main power grid.
Thought it might
reset his neural net.
It's happening all over the ship.
Power surges, temperature fluctuations.
And now you're telling me
it's been him all along?
- Is that for me?
- Hera wrote the notes
to a song that my father
used to play to me when I was a child.
The same song that led us to Earth.
There's a pattern that I can't see.
But I think that you can.
So we are going to pick it apart
until we figure it out.
- It's impossible. Somebody saw her.
- What the hell's going on up there?
Boomer took Hera,
just walked right out of the daycare.
Job well done.
Go get some rest.
Don't worry.
We'll take good care of her.
No, Boomer!
If Cavil's plan was to steal Hera
so he could study her,
they'll take her to the colony.
That's where we and the Centurions
went after the first war.
We're abandoning ship, Tigh.
Put out the orders that I want the crew
to start stripping down Galactica,
packing all the weapons and gear.
I want to start offloading the civilians
by tomorrow.
Full crew and ordinances transferred
by the end of the week.
To Galactica,
best ship of the fleet.
To Galactica.

I've commanded two Battlestars
and three escorts before that.
Come on, Bill. Don't be like that.
There's nothing to get all upset about.
Billions of cubits worth
of equipment entrusted to me
not to mention thousands of lives.
It's one hour of your life.
Look, sometimes there are things
you just gotta do, all right?
You always drink and drive?
I drink, he drives.
You like having things done for you,
don't you?
Certainly beats having to do them
for yourself.
Don't you?
No, I prefer not to rely on others
as much as possible.
Less chance
of being let down that way.
Since you allowed yourself
to be in my capable hands
for this evening,
here's hoping I won't let you down.
I'll drink to that, Doctor.
You can...
You can call me Gaius,
actually, if you want.
This is crazy,
but I've actually forgotten your name.
Hello.
Yes, it is.
Hello. How are you?
What?
What?
My Gods. When was this?
Well, listen, just...
I'm so sorry.
If you just wait there,
and I'll be around as soon as I can...
No, please. You have to wait.
You have to...
You can't meet...
You will wait there
or I'll sue you for abandonment.
Yeah, I will.
Well, I don't know how long
it's gonna take. Just wait.
I'm coming.
I'm coming right now.
- Give my love to Sydney!
- I will! Bye bye.
That was a great shower.
Oh, my Gods.
That was amazing.
Just gonna clean up a little bit here.
Laura, no cleaning.
No. This is the last bottle
and you and I have to share it.
You promised me
you would finish all the champagne.
Boy. We drank a lot.
- Well, they did.
- They did.
What about me?
Pregnant girls only get gifts.
- Just a sip.
- A sip?
All right.
- Just one little.
- Little.
Go ahead.
Enough.
My gosh.
That was lovely, Laura. Thank you.
Well, it's the least I can do
for my little sister.
I thought I was your little sister.
Okay,
you are my really little sister.
Oh, boy.
How about that woman
with Mrs. Anderson?
- Why did she bring those?
- Who was she?
I don't know.
But, you know, there's always one.
Frak me. He's early.
Just a second!
Coming!
- Hi, I'm...
- You must be... Lee.
I'm sorry. I'm Kara. Come on in.
That's very nice.
You didn't have to do that.
I'll take those.
Put 'em in some water.
Zak!
Nice place.
It's a rattrap,
but the rent's cheap.
No. It's...
It's got real charm.
And you're a terrible liar.
We should play cards.
- I hold my own.
- I'm sure you do.
You just get uglier every day.
Hey, there he is.
How are you?
I see you've met my better half.
This one's mine. Keep your hands off.
And a girlfriend stealer for a brother.
Nice!
Never stole his girlfriend.
- He's a really bad liar right here.
- No, we figured that out already.
Zak, get the drinks.
- Dinner's almost ready.
- Yes, sir.
I don't know what to say.
It was a mistake.
Nothing in my contract about
being stabbed with a steak knife.
She been stealing
while I've been sleeping.
No one is stealing from you,
dad, all right?
Just shut up.
You're in enough trouble already.
I'm out of here.
You're lucky I don't call the cops.
Yes, we are, nurse Barbara. Thank you.
Now listen. I'll pay you double.
Triple. I thought I asked you
to wait in the car.
This be the new one you be banging?
None of your business.
Nurse, I've got 500 cubits. 1,000.
1,000 frakking cubits for you
to stay the night! Please!
I'll take all the knives away!
He'll be on liquid diet forever.
Just spend one frakking night!
How about you, love?
Bet you charge a lot more than that?
Shut your filthy mouth.
Stop being so disgusting.
- This is your father, Gaius.
- Not that you'd ever know it.
- Gaius is ashamed of his family.
- I need this.
I need this
like a frakking hole in the head.
Stupid bastard
actually changed his accent.
- Would you believe that?
- That is the third nurse in a row.
The third nurse.
Do you have any idea
how much this is costing?
How much it costs.
That's all he cares about now.
Not the way he was brought up,
I can tell ya.
But he don't like to think
about that.
No, he don't like to think
about living on the farm
- and doing a day's hard work.
- All right.
Enough!
Shut up!
Shut up right now!
I won't stand here one moment longer
and listen to your ridiculous
working class hero rant.
Look at you!
Look at your shirt
that I bought you.
How you dribble and treat these things.
I'll break it down for you, dad!
You're an obnoxious, spiteful,
cantankerous old git,
and you're frakking lucky
not living on the frakking street!
Big man cursing his father.
Makes you feel important, does it?
- Gaius, maybe we should...
- Maybe you should've stayed in the car,
which is what I asked you to do.
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave now.
I'm sure that the driver
can see you to your home.
I'm gonna spend the rest
of this lovely evening with my dad.
Good night.
Good morning.
I'm officer Stephanie
and this is officer Shawn
with the Caprica city police.
Are you Laura Roslin?
Yes, I am.
We need to speak with you.
May we come inside?
Yes, please do.
We're so sorry we have to inform you
there's been a terrible accident.
Late last night, your sisters
and your father were all killed.
We weren't able to verify
the identity of the bodies
until a few hours ago.
The driver of the other vehicle
is in stable condition.
And preliminary tests
indicate he was intoxicated
when he sideswiped the car
with your father and your sisters.
Thank you.
Please show yourselves out.
We're sorry for your loss.
I don't know what she's doing.
There's only so much
of Galactica to go around.
You'd think
we're retiring ten Battlestars.
- Excuse me.
- One second.
Tell the captains
they are padding their requests.
- Send it back.
- Sir, if you have a minute.
Just one second.
Specialist, what is it?
I know this is not your problem,
Sir, but
they want us to tear the mag cellerators
from the launch tubes.
Well, the civilian ships
can use them as auto-loaders.
Sir, it's like we're tearing
the old girl's heart out.
A Battlestar's whole purpose
is to launch Vipers.
I kind of know how you feel.
Part of my heart's here too.
Tell you what...
Make the cellerators
the last thing your men take out.
Then turn out the lights
and let the old girl die in peace.
Yes, sir.
Well, after the blast,
everyone else's numbers are down,
which gives us solid majorities on over
half the civilian ships in the fleet.
I mean, no one else comes even close
to having that kind of political power.
Our time is here, Gaius.
She's right, Gaius.
The end times are approaching.
Humanity's final chapter's
about to be written and you...
you will be its author.
Gaius, did you hear me?
This is it.
This is it, Gaius.
Are you...
you thirsty before...
What are you doing here?
How did you get in here?
- Should I...
- What you should do
is go up those stairs, turn left,
go in the bedroom, and get ready.
You are an intruder in my home.
I think it would be a good idea
if you left
before inform the authorities.
If that's the way
you wanna play it, then...
then I'm ringing the police.
Police department, please.
- I found your father a place to live.
- Yes, I'd like to re...
What?
The Regency.
Down by the wharf.
Very tony address.
Full-time care,
social activities, medical staff.
And the best part,
they encourage residents to garden
and grow their own food.
Julius will be a farmer again.
His things are being moved
this very moment by the staff.
They'll be set up
in his new room exactly
how he had them in the apartment.
He loves it.
Loves?
Once I showed him around
the facility.
Your father's a very complicated man,
Gaius, but there's a few
simple things
that make him very happy.
The last time I saw him...
he seemed happy.
Sorry, sir.
As I was saying,
the old man intends to fly
the last Viper off ship himself.
Tell the deck gang
to leave one launch tube intact,
- set to remote pilot launch.
- Yes, sir.
You'll never make Admiral like that.
They're all the same, Karl.
<i>No, they're different.</i>
<i>You know they're different.</i>
How you felt about Boomer,
that was different.
That's why you did what you did.
<i>I did what I did
because I'm a frakkin' idiot.</i>
<i>A 2,000-year-old idiot</i>
<i>who cannot learn
the simplest lesson.</i>
Machines are not people.
They're just machines.
<i>My wife,</i>
<i>Athena,</i>
<i>is a person.</i>
<i>She's a blow-up doll, Karl.
They all are.</i>
<i>Athena, Sharon, Boomer. Call 'em
what you will. They're all the same.</i>
They're all the same
because we made them the same.
<i>Don't blame yourself,
but you can't trust 'em.</i>
<i>You can't trust any of 'em.</i>
Dots.
Lots and lots and lots of dots.
- She's clearly very gifted.
- She hasn't eaten in days.
I think we should begin
intravenous nutritional supplements
to build up her strength
before we begin testing.
She wants her mother.
She can't have her mother now,
can she?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot to sound all soppy and soft
when speaking of the child.
She is a child.
A frightened one.
She's a half human,
half machine object of curiosity
that holds the key
to our continued existence
somewhere in her genetic code.
So let's get a tube
in her and get her ready.
Frak. You didn't hear that,
all right?
Let me help you.
- These are...
- Pilots from the memorial wall.
We wanted to take them with us, so we
wouldn't leave them with the others.
- The others.
- Lotta of photos still down there.
Nobody knows who they are anymore.
Probably friends and relatives
of people on Galactica
who died somewhere along the way.
As you were.
Bear it in mind?
Well, when will you bear it in mind?
You haven't even listened
to my proposal.
I'm not even saying
it was necessarily be me.
My people deserve
a voice in the government.
Now, I'm literally talking
about the lives and well-being
of thousands of people in the fleet.
Is that what you were thinking about
when you outted Starbuck's secret?
The well-being
of thousands of people?
Or the political gain
of Gaius Baltar... again?
Is that what this is about?
Does everything have to be reduced
to your personal feelings
about Kara Thrace?
Listen to me, Mr. Adama.
I'm asking to have
a genuine conversation.
Please.
Five minutes.
I'll be back in five minutes.
Five minutes inside.
And you think there's some kind
of meaning in these musical notes.
I don't know.
I'm just groping mostly.
Looking for patterns.
Trying to see what comes to me.
I thought that if I assigned
numbers to the notes...
I don't know.
What Baltar said the other day,
is it the truth?
Yeah.
I found my body
and I burned it on Earth.
I don't know what I am.
I have to ask him a question.
Do you know how to plug him in?
Yeah.
I know what you are.
You're my daughter.
Don't forget it.
You're on pace to land
in the hall of fame some day.
But you still haven't won
a championship
and now the C-Bucs
are in a rebuilding year.
If you don't get to hoist
the cup before you retire,
will you consider
your career to be incomplete?
Well, right now, I'm just...
focused on getting stronger
and helping out the team
any way I can.
Look, you want to know the truth?
I don't really care
about the stats or the cup
or the trophy or anything like that.
In fact, even the games
aren't that important to me.
Not really.
What matters to me is...
the perfect throw, okay?
Making the perfect catch.
The perfect step and block.
It's perfection.
That's what it's about.
It's about those moments when you...
When you can feel
the perfection of creation.
The... the beauty of physics.
The wonder of mathematics.
You know, the... the elation
of action and reaction.
And that is the kind of perfection
that I wanna be connected to.
Spins and turns.
Angles and curves.
The shape of dreams half-remembered.
Slip the surly bonds of Earth
and touch the face of perfection.
A perfect face.
Perfect lace.
Find a perfect world
for the end of Kara Thrace.
End of line.
He says a lot of things.
Go ahead.
Ask your question.
You ask him.
Let's forget
you're the son of the admiral.
Shut the frak up.
Get to the frakkin' point.
You got five minutes. Speak.
Galactica has been more
than our guardian.
She's literally a vessel into which we
have poured all of our hopes and dreams.
And when she's gone,
when we can no longer
derive the security
from looking out a window
and seeing her massive bulk gliding by,
then this life will be over
and a new life will have begun.
A new life
that requires a new way of thinking.
Now, I am willing to do anything...
anything I can
to make this new life a good one.
All I am asking is that my people
have a voice in the government.
I represent thousands of people.
They deserve to be enfranchised
just as much as anyone else.
I'm not talking about myself.
This is not for me personally.
Come on, Lee.
It makes sense.
You know it's the right thing to do.
What I know...
Is that in all the years
that I've known you, I've never seen you
- make one truly selfless act.
- Right.
Never seen you do something
that didn't on some level
serve the greater needs
of Gaius frakking Baltar.
So, no, I won't take your hand.
And I won't bring you
or any representative
from your movement into the government.
Right. So that's
what it boils down to.
My people can't get representation
because I personally haven't passed
Lee Adama's selfless altruism test.
I haven't been a goody-goody
and won a badge of honor.
I don't think you've passed
Gaius Baltar's test.
Go ahead, look me in the eye
and tell me about the time
that you made a truly
heroic act of conscience
which helped you
not even in the slightest.
Tell me!
I'll even believe you.
You're right.
I wouldn't trust me either.
Holy frak.
I dare you.
I double-dog dare you.
Get out of here!
Come on!
Come on!
Attaboy!
Frak.
Stupid frakkin' bird.
Can I have your attention, please?
I'm sure you're all aware that a child
was abducted from this ship recently.
I thought that a rescue mission
was impractical.
Well, I was wrong.
He didn't say
where he got the information but
Starbuck was there,
so I bet he talked to Anders.
Yeah. I know.
Pretty freaky.
He thought
a rescue mission was impractical
because he didn't know
where she was being held.
But that's changed now, I guess,
because he does know
where she's being held.
Knowing where the colony is
is not nearly the same thing
as being able to actually get her out.
This is insane.
You know that, right?
Hera has some meaning
that transcends the here and now.
She's meant to fulfill a role
just as we were.
So we're going... the five of us.
You're making decisions
for all of us now.
You'll go, Tory.
Truth is, you never could be alone.
Yeah, the mission is to be
strictly volunteer only.
Any man or woman over the age of 15.
And the Admiral also wants
any former colonial officer or crewmen
incarcerated
after the recent mutiny.
Yeah. That's it.
Everyone has to make their own choice
and they have to do it in person.
The old man is waiting
on the hangar deck.
Set in-port watch
until you get back.
Watch keepers
report to the Admiral's quarters
to declare yourselves in person.
Move.
- You know what you're gonna do?
- Not exactly.
Well, take your time.
Takes approximately four minutes
to get down there.
It's really happening.
We're going after her.
Or what's left of her.
Cavil's probably had her
sliced and diced
- and cut up into a thousand specimens.
- Stop it.
Just stop it.
She's still alive.
And she's till out there.
And we're gonna get her.
And everything's gonna be all right.
It's not gonna be all right, Karl.
You're wrong.
You're wrong.
I know it's been three months.
I know that.
I do too go out.
I do.
I do.
No, I'm not joining
Adar's presidential campaign.
I don't care.
Because I don't like politics
to begin with
and a national campaign
is just so...
Gods,
you are relentless.
I'll make you a deal.
I'll go on the date
if you'll stop bugging me
about this campaign.
How young is he?
I know.
I made a deal.
What's Mr. Perfect's name?
Sean. I like that name.
Sean what?
Sean Allison?
Sounds familiar.
All right.
Bye.
No one should feel obligated
to join this mission
in any way!
This is a decision
I have made for myself.
If it turns out
that there are not enough personnel
to crew Galactica...
I will lead a Raptor assault
with anyone
who is willing to join me.
Let there be no illusions!
This is likely to be
a one-way trip.
So don't volunteer out of sentiment
or emotion.
There is a line running down
this deck.
Volunteers,
move to the starboard side!
Everyone else,
to the port.
Make your choice.
Doc.
The fleet can't afford
to lose a Doctor.
Go on back, Sherman.
And thank you.
Like you got something better to do.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
You didn't think
you were gonna take off without me,
Admiral, did you?
Never crossed my mind,
Madam President.
Jump complete.
Frak!
- Plot us a way back out of here.
- Right. You got it.
<i>Figures that a brain damaged Cylon
would send us in an asteroid field.</i>
The more things change,
the more they stay the same.
You got a recon mission
where someone needs
to hang their ass over the edge
and wait for a bite,
- send Racetrack and Skulls.
- Well, beats sittin' in a cell.
Long range dradis
just picked something up.
Holy frak,
we're right on top of a singularity.
A black hole? Where away?
738 carom 882.
We're already sliding toward it.
Spin up the FTL.
We're getting out of here.
Frak me.
- What?
- You're not gonna believe this.
Based on the coordinates
we got from Sam,
we've determined
that the Cylon Colony is located here.
It's within our jump range,
but there's a sizable catch.
It's located within an accretion disk
of a naked singularity.
It's a strategically sound position.
The Colony's bound within
the gravity well of the black hole,
- but maintains a stable orbit.
- How do we get in there?
Look at all the crap
floating around in that current.
There's no way to navigate that current.
The tidal stresses are too strong.
It would rip the ship apart
before we got within ten SU.
There is one safe jump spot. It's where
they bring their baseships in and out.
We got lucky.
Two baseships jumped in and out
while the Raptor
was taking pictures.
This right here is our only
parking spot.
That's right on top
of the frakking thing.
- Less than one click by our estimates.
- One click?
Point blank range.
And you can bet that
they will have every gun in that colony
pointed at that parking spot
of yours.
That's what I'd do.
Leave only one way in and out
then make it impossible
to get past the gates.
All right.
Let's get to work.
Thank you for watching Galactica
with our subtitles
<i>Précédemment dans</i>
Battlestar Galactica...
CAPRICA
AVANT SA CHUTE
- Tu dois être Lee.
- Bonjour, je...
Un voleur de copine, le frérot.
- Sympa !
- J'ai jamais volé de copine.
Il ment très mal.
Il y a eu un terrible accident.
Vos soeurs et votre père
ont été tués.
Et toi, ma chérie ?
- Je parie que tu prends plus cher.
- Tu la fermes.
Ne sois pas répugnant.
C'est votre père.
J'ai trouvé un foyer
pour votre père.
La dernière fois que je l'ai vu,
il avait l'air heureux.
GALACTICA
AUJOURD'HUI
J'ai refait ce rêve.
Si c'est moi, là-dedans,
je suis quoi ?
Elle les a ramassées
sur sa propre dépouille.
Le sang sur ces plaques
appartient sans l'ombre d'un doute
au capitaine Kara Thrace.
Tu penses qu'il y a un sens caché
dans ces notes.
Je tâtonne, surtout.
Je cherche une trame.
C'est une curiosité
mi-humaine, mi-machine
qui détient la clé de notre avenir
dans son code génétique.
On la branche et on la prépare.
Selon les coordonnées de Sam,
on a déterminé
que la colonie cylon est située ici.
La colonie est aspirée
par le puits gravitationnel,
mais elle reste en orbite.
Voici notre seule place de parking.
À bout portant.
Ne laisser qu'un seul accès
et rendre les portes
infranchissables.
Mettons-nous au boulot.
Votre attention.
Je vais demander des volontaires
pour le sauvetage de Hera.
Une ligne divise ce pont.
Volontaires,
rassemblez-vous à tribord !
Les autres, à bâbord.
40 ? J'ai jamais payé
plus de 30 sur Picon !
On n'est pas sur Picon.
Exact, tu m'as eu.
"On n'est pas sur Picon."
Va pour 40.
Qu'il passe du bon temps !
Je ne veux pas de strip-tease.
L'essayer, c'est l'adopter !
Gardez les 40,
ça lui apprendra. Merci.
- Tu vas l'accepter, ce boulot ?
- Je devrais peut-être.
Ma fierté m'en empêche.
Bien dit.
Qu'est-ce qu'on en a à foutre !
Ça va te prendre une heure
et t'auras une nouvelle vie !
Une vie sans quarts de nuit,
sans exercices,
sans politique, sans inspections,
sans toutes ces conneries.
La vie !
Tu pourrais venir ici
tous les soirs !
Ça risque pas. On a déjà eu du mal
à le traîner ici une fois...
À la retraite ?
T'en dis quoi ?
À la retraite.
Si tu ne votes pas,
tu abandonnes ta voix.
Tu n'as plus ton mot à dire
sur la manière
dont notre société est dirigée.
- Quoi ?
- Tu crois vraiment à ces conneries ?
Oui, et j'en suis fier.
- Toi aussi, d'ailleurs.
- Vraiment ?
C'est ce que représente l'uniforme.
C'est ce que nous défendons.
- Il y croit !
- C'est vrai !
- C'est mignon, mais triste.
- Laisse-moi deviner.
Il te serine avec l'importance
d'aller voter dans la vie.
Donc, tu m'écoutais.
Tu m'avais caché
que ton frère était un doux rêveur.
- Doux rêveur.
- C'est triste. Et c'est même pas vrai.
Sous ces airs de romantique
se cache un vrai cynique.
- Le voile se lève.
- Vraiment ? Raconte.
C'est l'une des nombreuses raisons
qui font que papa et lui
ne se parlent plus.
- Arrête.
- Les drames familiaux,
j'adore. Allez, les gars.
- Ravivons les vieilles blessures.
- Non.
Papa croit au système,
à l'uniforme, à quelque chose
de plus grand que lui.
Correction, papa croit en lui-même.
À son uniforme, son système,
sa façon de vivre.
Et si tu sors de son carcan,
- alors tu peux aussi bien disparaître.
- Si tu le détestes tant,
pourquoi marcher dans ses pas ?
L'engagement m'a payé 4 années de fac.
Je passerai donc 4 ans à l'armée.
- C'est tout.
- Tu vois ?
Le cynisme s'est logé
dans l'espace vide
qui accueillait son coeur avant.
Chéri, je commence
à apprécier ton frère.
Vous devez être Sean.
Ça doit être ça, oui.
J'espère.
- Elles sont superbes, merci.
- Je vous en prie.
Vous aimez le vin blanc ?
Oui.
Bizarre, hein ?
- Les rencontres arrangées.
- Non, ça va.
Mais j'ai l'impression...
que je vous connais.
Vraiment ?
Tenez, Sean.
- Merci.
- De rien.
Attendez un peu.
Vous étiez un de mes étudiants.
Je plaide coupable.
Dès que Marcie
a dit votre nom, j'ai su,
mais je n'ai rien dit.
- Je suis assez vieille pour être...
- Mon professeur ? Oui.
Mais j'ai eu mon diplôme.
Il y a un moment.
- Vous voulez que j'y aille ?
- J'ai dit ça ?
Je ne crois pas.
La nuit débute, vous aussi visiblement.
Voyons où ça nous mène.
Sean Allison.
Toi, tu refuserais.
Pour autant de pognon ?
Bien sûr que j'accepterais.
C'est faux.
Regarde-moi dans les yeux
et dis-moi que t'accepterais.
Que t'accepterais
un boulot de bureaucrate.
Je veux l'entendre de ta bouche.
Dis-le !
Je le savais, putain.
Allez, soldat.
Je vous aime.
Vous êtes ma famille.
Par les Dieux. Allez.
- Je t'aime, frérot.
- Allez, mon grand.
- Les jambes.
- Bien.
Tu y es.
- Je te délivre ?
- Oui, s'il te plaît.
Merci.
- Il n'a jamais tenu l'alcool.
- Pas comme son frère.
Je suis encore debout.
Ce qui veut dire...
Qu'on se refait une tournée.
Inutile de mettre martel en tête.
Dieu a des projets pour toi,
aie confiance.
Quels projets ?
Tu les mets en oeuvre
en ce moment même.
Vraiment ?
En prenant en charge
les rescapés de l'espèce humaine,
et en les guidant jusqu'au bout.
Au bout de quoi ?
Gaius.
- On est prêts à partir.
- Un instant.
Je...
Je laisse à Ishay
de quoi faire 2 séries d'injections.
Ça devrait vous permettre
de tenir debout 48 h.
Deux jours, d'accord.
Ça... devrait suffire.
Vous épuisez le peu de vie
qui vous reste, vous savez ?
Oui, vous me l'avez assez répété.
Bien. Et voilà.
- C'est fait.
- Merci.
Et...
Merci, docteur.
Je ne fais que mon boulot.
Vous avez fait bien plus.
Vous avez pris en charge...
une patiente
qui aurait dû mourir
il y a des années, et vous...
lui avez donné une chance
malgré le cancer,
les Cylons et son propre entêtement.
Et vous m'avez...
donné le peu de temps qu'il me reste
et pour ça vous...
Vous avez ma...
ma sincère
gratitude et ma reconnaissance.
Eh bien, je...
- Je sais pas quoi dire.
- Ne dites rien.
Ne ruinez pas votre personnage,
allumez une cigarette et ronchonnez.
La patiente est à vous, Ishay.
Ishay, je...
- Je vois mal.
- Ça ne me surprend pas.
Vous êtes tellement droguée
que vous pourriez léviter.
D'accord. Deux jours ?
Très bien, deux jours.
Le plan prend forme,
mais une chose est sûre.
Les Raptors feront le plus dur,
comme d'habitude.
Cette mission exige
un pilotage de haut vol.
Comme passer le fil
dans une aiguille sur un grand huit.
Ça semble superflu, mais seuls
les volontaires participeront, donc...
Ça, c'est mes cow-boys.
Toujours à l'affût d'un nouveau moyen
de se faire descendre.
Je ne vous mentirai pas,
on n'a pas beaucoup d'infos.
D'après les Cylons,
Cavil a emmené la fillette
au coeur de la colonie.
Probablement...
ici.
On sera trop près
pour les bombes et les missiles.
Il faudra s'en tenir aux canons
et en découdre à bout portant,
tels deux vieux vaisseaux.
Les officiers-artilleurs
devront faire feu immédiatement.
Jusqu'à épuisement des munitions.
Alors...
je veux qu'ils jettent des cailloux.
Toute leur puissance de feu
sera pointée sur nous dès notre arrivée.
Pour avoir une chance,
il faut désactiver leur armement.
Et en quoi Sam
peut nous y aider ?
Si on arrive à le connecter au Dradis,
au FTL et au système C-3 du Galactica
son esprit pourra communiquer
avec les hybrides de la colonie.
En théorie,
il doit pouvoir les contrôler
et ralentir leur temps de réaction.
D'accord.
- Allons-y.
- Il y a un détail.
Rerouter les systèmes du vaisseau
dans cette pièce prendra des semaines.
Il serait plus simple et rapide
de le déplacer là où ils sont.
- C'est-à-dire ?
- Le meilleur endroit est le CIC.
Il me faut quelqu'un
pour diriger cette flotte.
Quelqu'un en qui j'ai confiance
et que tout le monde respecte.
Le vaisseau-mère et la flotte
sont entre vos mains.
Merci, amiral.
Je ne vous décevrai pas.
- J'en suis convaincu.
- À bientôt, au point de rendez-vous.
Si on n'est pas là dans 12 heures,
n'attendez pas.
Oui, amiral.
Bonne chasse.
Merci, amiral Hoshi.
Il est pas trop tard
pour tous les expulser par un sas.
Pas le temps.
Ça doit être ça,
la justice poétique.
On récolte ce qu'on sème.
En tout cas,
félicitations, M. le président.
Merci, M. Adama. Et bonne chance.
Amiral Hoshi.
Chef.
- Le "chef" c'est...
- C'est vrai. Bonne chance.
Vous aussi, amiral.
Le président des Colonies,
et l'amiral de la flotte
quittent le vaisseau.
Très bien, dernier Raptor à partir !
À tous ceux qui restent ici,
vos miches nous appartiennent !
Super. On peut caser ça ?
Je ne viens pas avec vous.
- Non.
- Ma décision est prise.
- Les nôtres ont besoin de toi.
- Je ne suis pas des vôtres.
Je ne l'ai jamais été.
Vous m'avez adopté.
Désolé.
Désolé si je vous ai fait croire...
Ils sont à toi, maintenant.
Pilote, vous êtes au complet.
- Ne fais pas ça.
- À bientôt, dans une autre vie.
Docteur.
<i>Galactica, ici le vaisseau-mère.</i>
<i>Transfert de commandement effectué.</i>
<i>Nos Vipers sont prêts
à assurer la CAP.</i>
Bien reçu, vaisseau-mère,
la CAP est à vous.
- Bon voyage.
<i>- Bonne chance, Galactica.</i>
Sonne le rassemblement.
Ici le XO.
Tous les postes de combat
au rapport.
<i>- FTL.</i>
- Paré.
On fera le triage ici.
Préparez ça comme je le fais.
- <i>Armes.
- Paré.</i>
Séparez les blessés.
Ceux qu'on peut sauver
et les autres.
- <i>Manoeuvre.
- Paré.</i>
Comment faire la différence ?
Prenez ce marqueur.
Faites un X sur le front
des condamnés.
Vous le saurez en les voyant.
<i>Batterie principale.</i>
<i>Paré.</i>
- <i>Machines.
- Paré.</i>
C'est à nous.
<i>Infirmerie.</i>
<i>Infirmerie, parée.</i>
- <i>Vipers.</i>
- Paré.
<i>Assaut 1.</i>
<i>Assaut 2.</i>
<i>Réserve.</i>
<i>Com 1.</i>
- Désolée.
- Caprica.
<i>Com 2.</i>
Que fais-tu ici ?
Tu ne devrais pas être là.
J'ai sans doute vécu
plus de batailles que toi.
- Très juste.
<i>- Équipements de survie.</i>
<i>Système d'urgence en attente.</i>
La vraie question, c'est :
"Qu'est-ce que je fais ici ?"
Qu'est-ce qui m'a pris ?
<i>Sécurisez
tous les sas anti-explosion.</i>
Nous sommes prêts.
Tous les postes parés.
Branchez-moi au vaisseau.
Ici l'amiral.
Afin d'écarter
tout futur malentendu,
sachez que le Galactica
a une longue histoire.
<i>Il a mené maintes batailles.</i>
<i>Celle-ci est sa dernière.</i>
<i>Il ne nous décevra pas</i>
<i>si on ne le déçoit pas.</i>
<i>Si nous réussissons notre mission,
il nous ramènera à la maison.</i>
<i>Sinon...</i>
<i>ça n'aura plus d'importance.</i>
Aux postes de combat.
- Compte à rebours.
- Compte à rebours.
Saut à mon signal...
cinq, quatre,
trois,
deux, un.
Saut.
On tiendra pas longtemps.
C'est le moment, Sam.
Regarde-toi à travers tes yeux.
Leurs hybrides sont hors jeu.
Ils vont bientôt lancer les Raiders.
Lancez les nôtres.
Nos vaisseaux ont décollé.
En avant toute. Vitesse maximale !
Trois, deux, un, en avant !
<i>Préparez-vous à l'impact.</i>
<i>Assaut 1, en attente.</i>
Les voilà. Prenez-les !
Ouvre.
Équipe d'assaut, avec moi.
Allez. Tout le monde dehors.
- Niveau de pression ?
- Il y en a.
Une atmosphère.
Assaut 1, c'est pressurisé.
Équipe Alpha, retirez les casques.
En avant.
On a perdu Cartwheel.
- Le Dradis est inutile là-dedans.
- Espérons que les leurs aussi.
On a été repérés ?
J'ai pas vérifié depuis un moment.
Tu veux vraiment savoir ?
Peut-être pas.
Prépare nos armes, Skulls.
On se rapproche.
- T'es sûre ?
- Non.
Mais je veux pas sortir de ce merdier
la fleur au fusil.
Atomiques prêtes.
Ça me rappelle le bon vieux temps,
pendant nos qualifs.
Batteries 3, redirigez vos tirs !
10 degrés tribord !
Concentrez-vous
sur leurs batteries !
Hotdog, Ladykiller,
<i>occupez-vous des Raiders cylons</i>
cap 084, inclinaison 229.
On s'en occupe.
<i>On est arrimés. On y va.</i>
Tu vas continuer les tests ?
Alors que la colonie s'effondre ?
Tu surestimes leurs chances.
Ils ont réussi
à embrouiller nos hybrides un moment,
mais nous sommes supérieurs
en nombre et en puissance de feu.
C'est mathématique.
Écoute-moi.
Tu surcharges le contrôle d'altitude.
Si tu te retires pas,
tu vas faire sauter le bus principal.
Sam !
Des secrets dans les yeux,
des réponses dans les énigmes.
Couper le contrôle d'altitude ?
Oui, Galen.
Écoutez ce que le coeur veut nier.
Fin de ligne.
Tu n'aurais pas dû
lui faire confiance.
Rien à voir avec la confiance.
J'ai simplement mal évalué
son besoin d'actions futiles.
Elle voudra sûrement retrouver
les forces coloniales
à bord de la colonie.
- Il est temps de passer à l'offensive.
- Mais avec prudence.
Nous risquerions de tuer l'enfant.
Vraiment ? Tu crois ?
Continue à enfoncer
des portes ouvertes.
Ça me remplit d'assurance.
Je suis fière de toi.
Pourquoi ?
Que tu fasses ça.
Tu es là, alors que tu aurais pu partir.
Je ne crois pas te l'avoir dit...
J'ai toujours voulu
être fière de toi.
J'ai toujours eu le sentiment
qu'il ne me manquait plus que ça.
Toutes les pièces s'assemblent.
Vous tiendrez dans vos mains
l'avenir des Cylons et des hommes.
Ah bon ?
Tu les vois ?
Reconnectez-moi !
Les Cylons viennent de percer un trou
sur le pont 21 !
Des pelotons entiers de Centurions
vont débarquer !
Suivez-moi !
Attends.
Dites au Patron...
qu'on est quittes.
Ça t'excuse en rien.
On fait tous des choix.
Aujourd'hui, j'ai fait un choix.
Sûrement mon dernier.
Très touchant.
Et si on décampait ?
Votre Raptor a été détruit.
Vous ne pouvez pas repartir par là.
- C'est pas notre plan.
- Tu peux éviter de le lui dire ?
Pardon.
Vous avez raté la trappe
sept fois en deux jours.
C'est un nouveau record galactique.
D'après le règlement,
on doit vous virer, bleusaille.
- Il est temps de changer de branche.
- Qu'attendez-vous de moi ?
Que je vous supplie de me garder ?
Que je rampe ?
Je veux que vous atterrissiez
sans creuser des trous
sur mon pont. C'est à votre portée ?
Vous pouvez devenir pilote ?
Un officier digne de l'uniforme ?
Prenez votre travail au sérieux.
Ne laissez pas votre vie privée
vous influencer.
J'ai lu votre dossier.
Tout votre passé.
Votre famille est morte,
vous n'avez plus de foyer.
Il ne vous reste que l'armée.
Et elle s'éloigne lentement.
Tout ça parce que
vous culpabilisez d'avoir survécu.
Vous cherchez un moyen d'en finir.
Le docteur est là.
Pour vos névroses, voyez avec lui.
Beaucoup de gens sont morts
sur ce vaisseau.
Y a un paquet de fantômes
dans le coin.
Ne les embarquez pas
dans votre cockpit.
Vous n'en sortiriez pas vivante.
Compris ?
Oui, monsieur.
Non, je ne crois pas, mais...
ça viendra, un jour.
Pour le moment...
Réussissez votre atterrissage demain,
bleusaille.
Rompez.
Merci, monsieur.
Je vous le revaudrai.
Beaucoup de gens m'ont dit ça,
et vous savez quoi ?
Très peu le font.
Surtout ceux qui me doivent la vie.
Je vous le revaudrai un jour.
Quand ce sera important.
Faites donc ça.
Examine cet homme
et pose une intraveineuse.
Ce marine a besoin de compresses
et celui-là, d'une IRM.
Et faites-le sortir de là !
Ça va aller.
Vous allez vous en sortir.
C'est fini.
Vous allez...
Vous allez vous en sortir.
- Qu'est-ce qui vous a retardé ?
- La pause café.
Combien d'autres Raptors
sont arrivés ?
On n'a vu que vous.
OK, on rebrousse chemin.
Guns, Point...
Monsieur ?
Ouvrez-nous la route.
Répétez, Apollo !
J'ai pas reçu votre transmission !
Ici le XO.
Chevrons rouges,
repoussez les arrivants.
- Pont 21, bâbord, porte 10.
- <i>On a le trésor !</i>
<i>Je répète, on l'a !</i>
<i>On rejoint la base
avec l'équipe d'assaut 2.</i>
Bien reçu !
Arrivée dans cinq minutes.
Terminé.
Incendie !
On a un incendie !
Passez-moi l'unité en charge !
Envoyez la réserve
pour garder le sas.
Une force d'assaut est en route.
Arrivée dans 5 min.
Je répète, arrivée dans 5 min.
On est dans le même camp !
Cessez le feu ! Alliés !
Rangel, Peters, formez les rangs !
- Désolé.
- Doc, c'était bien.
- Merci.
- On prend Hera.
D'accord.
- Allez.
- Amenez Hera.
Sortez-le de là.
On se replie.
Quoi ?
Hera.
C'est dégagé !
- Occupe-t-en.
- Laisse tomber. Reviens ici.
Tiens le coup.
Reviens là !
- Hera !
- Regarde-moi !
- Vas-y.
- Non, tu vas perdre ton sang.
Vas-y !
Je suis à sec.
Deux salves.
Je suis déjà venu ici.
- On est censés...
- Entrer dans l'opéra.
- Celui-là est en vie !
- Sortez-le d'ici !
Ils ont l'enfant.
Ils ont la fillette !
Ça simplifie les choses.
- Je prends la petite et je sors d'ici.
- Hors de question.
On te la laissera pas.
Tu le sais.
Je ne sais rien du tout.
Je vais vous regarder
vous épuiser à parcourir l'univers
- pendant encore 4 ans.
- Ça n'arrivera pas.
Cette chose est la clé de la survie
de mon peuple, et je pars avec elle.
Hera n'est pas une chose.
C'est une enfant.
Et elle détient aussi la clé
de la survie de l'humanité.
Qu'en savez-vous ?
Je vois des anges.
Dans cette salle.
Je suis peut-être fou.
Ça n'empêche pas d'avoir raison.
Une autre force est à l'oeuvre ici.
Elle l'a toujours été, c'est indéniable.
On l'a tous vue.
Chacun ici a assisté à des événements
qu'il ne peut comprendre,
sans parler
de les expliquer rationnellement.
Des énigmes déchiffrées
par la prophétie,
des rêves offerts à quelques élus.
Nos amours décédés.
Ressuscités.
Qu'on l'appelle "Dieu" ou "Dieux",
ou inspiration sublime,
ou force divine
qui dépasse notre entendement,
aucune importance.
C'est ici.
Ça existe.
Et nos destinées
sont liées par sa force.
Si c'est vrai,
et c'est un sacré "si",
comment savoir si cette force
a en tête nos intérêts ?
Comment savez-vous
que Dieu est de votre côté, docteur ?
Je l'ignore.
Dieu n'est du côté de personne.
Dieu est une force de la nature
au-delà du bien et du mal.
Nous avons créé le bien et le mal.
Nous allons briser le cycle.
Briser le cycle de la naissance,
de la mort, de la renaissance,
de la destruction,
de la fuite, de la mort.
C'est à nous d'en décider.
À nous seuls.
Ça nécessite un acte de foi.
Il faut vivre avec l'espoir,
et non la peur.
Si je la lâche,
ça signifie la fin des miens.
Et notre extinction,
quelle est sa place dans ce tableau ?
On vous donne la résurrection.
Donne-nous Hera
et on vous donne la résurrection.
Mais la guerre est terminée.
Vous laissez l'humanité en paix
et vous promettez
de ne plus jamais l'attaquer.
Entendu.
Comment être sûrs
que vous tiendrez parole ?
Vous ne pouvez pas.
Il s'agit d'un acte de foi.
Choisis, Bill.
Je te suivrai dans tous les cas.
Je perds de nombreux hommes, là.
Je peux arranger ça tout de suite.
- Passez-moi ce téléphone.
- Connectez-le.
C'est moi, Cavil.
Baissez les armes.
Cessez le feu immédiatement.
Galactica, Hotdog.
<i>Ils se replient.</i>
<i>Je répète. Ils se replient !</i>
Que tout le monde baisse les armes.
J'ai donné ma parole.
Amiral,
les Vipers sont à bord.
Il en manque quatre.
L'équipe d'assaut est à bord.
On a perdu sept Raptors.
Que font-ils ?
Chacun d'eux connaît
une partie du secret
de la résurrection.
Ils vont interagir
avec le flux de données, dans l'eau.
Et... je sais pas.
C'est du charabia technique
sur le partage d'informations
entre eux cinq,
puis l'envoi des données
vers la colonie.
Pendant un moment,
on va tout connaître sur les autres.
J'ai hâte de voir ça.
Il y a certaines choses...
qu'on a faites.
Certaines choses...
que certains pourraient
être choqués d'apprendre.
Je veux pas vous brusquer,
mais deux civilisations vous attendent.
Disons qu'on est d'accord...
peu importe ce qu'on apprend,
on est des Cylons,
on peut tous se tromper.
Tes noirs secrets sont pardonnés.
Allons-y.
Des nouvelles ?
On reçoit les données.
Ça a l'air bon.
Ils téléchargent
les schémas pour la résurrection.
- Téléchargement coupé.
- C'est un piège. Feu !
On doit se sortir de là.
Starbuck, fais-nous sauter !
J'ai pas les coordonnées !
Aucune importance !
Sors-nous de là tout de suite !
Saut !
Aie confiance en toi.
Il doit y avoir
un moyen de sortir d'ici.
Je pensais qu'en attribuant
des chiffres aux notes...
Si c'est moi, là-dedans,
je suis quoi ?
Ce n'est plus Kara Thrace
que je vois...
c'est un ange
auréolé de lumière divine.
Un ange.
Saut !
Tu tentes le destin.
Si j'ai un destin,
il est déjà écrit,
et y penser
n'accélérera pas les choses.
C'est exact. Mais voler...
en pensant à la mort,
c'est pas vraiment conseillé.
Tu vas finir par avoir peur
et douter de toi.
J'ai pas peur.
T'as dit que tu pensais
à la mort chaque fois
que tu montais dans un cockpit.
Oui, mais ça me fait pas peur.
C'est ce que tu comprends pas.
Alors, c'est...
Kara Thrace, la guerrière intrépide,
c'est ça ?
Non, je connais la peur.
J'ai même parfois peur.
Mais pas de la mort.
Alors, qu'est-ce qui te fait peur ?
Désolée.
Qu'on m'oublie.
- Tu vas bien ?
- Ça va.
- XO ?
- Amiral ?
Rapport d'avaries.
Je vais bien. Vas-y.
On est presque entiers.
Les moteurs, le système de survie...
Mais on est dans le rouge
pour les éléments latéraux.
Il a le dos brisé.
Il ne ressautera jamais.
Où qu'on soit arrivés,
on n'en repartira pas.
Où nous as-tu menés, Kara ?
12 HEURES PLUS TARD
Content de vous voir, amiral.
Appelez-moi lieutenant Hoshi.
Les étoiles d'amiral
pèsent un peu trop lourd.
J'ai jamais été aussi heureux
qu'en voyant ce Raptor arriver.
Les voilà, amiral.
La civilisation la plus avancée
qu'on ait localisée sur cette planète.
Je ne les vois pas parler.
Soit ils communiquent autrement,
ou ils ne connaissent pas le langage.
Vu leurs outils,
pour le moins rudimentaires,
je dirais qu'on a trouvé
une société tribale embryonnaire.
Ils enterrent leurs morts.
J'ai trouvé une tombe
et j'ai fait des tests.
Leur ADN est compatible
avec le nôtre.
On peut se reproduire avec eux.
Vous ne pensez qu'à ça, docteur.
Quoi ?
Je parle de la survie
de l'humanité, là,
pas d'une fiesta avec les indigènes.
Et vous n'avez
aucun sens de l'humour.
En effet.
Désolé.
Comment c'est possible ?
Que des êtres humains
évoluent naturellement
sur une planète
à un million d'années-lumière.
- Les chances que ça arrive sont...
- Infinitésimales, oui.
On pourrait même dire
qu'il s'agit d'une intervention divine.
Quel qu'en soit le responsable,
on est là.
Et on va y rester...
avec notre nouvelle famille.
Je préconise
qu'on amène tout sur cette crête.
L'accès à l'eau est facile,
avec la rivière en bas.
En fait, toute la zone est fertile.
On doit pouvoir dessiner l'ébauche
d'une ville d'ici un jour ou deux.
Pas de ville.
Pas cette fois.
Que proposez-vous ?
Brisons le cycle.
On laisse tout derrière nous
et on part de zéro.
On parle d'un peu plus
de 38 000 personnes...
l'humanité tout entière...
Avec seulement leurs vêtements
et quelques provisions.
Ce n'est pas
l'humanité tout entière.
- Des gens vivent ici.
- Des tribus.
Qui n'ont même pas de langage.
On peut leur transmettre.
On peut leur transmettre...
ce qu'on a de meilleur.
Mais pas les bagages.
Ni vaisseaux, ni équipement,
ni technologie, ni armes.
Si on a une leçon à retenir,
c'est que nos cerveaux
ont toujours surpassé nos coeurs.
La science nous fait avancer,
mais nos âmes...
restent en arrière.
Repartons de zéro.
On installe les civils
à différents endroits
sur toute la planète.
Notre objectif sera de les disperser
autant que possible
pour leur donner
le plus de chances de survie.
Les provisions seront partagées
équitablement entre les camps.
On notera les localisations,
et on les donnera à tout le monde.
Je suis étonné que tout le monde
accepte cette idée.
Je pensais que les gens
se révolteraient à l'idée de perdre
le peu de confort
qu'il nous restait.
Ne sous-estimez pas leur désir
de faire table rase du passé.
Avez-vous décidé ?
Les Six, les Huit et les Deux
ont décidé de rester,
pour voir comment on peut aider
avant que Dieu nous rappelle.
On donne le vaisseau-mère
aux Centurions,
pour qu'ils trouvent leur voie.
Ils méritent leur liberté.
Et s'ils évoluent à nouveau
et reviennent nous éradiquer
dans quelques centaines d'années ?
Le risque existe.
Mais les libérer pourrait suffire
à briser le cycle de la violence.
C'est un risque à prendre.
Je suis d'accord.
Ils le méritent.
Quand les civils
auront été débarqués,
la flotte quittera l'orbite
et rejoindra le Galactica.
Leur course aura été programmée
dans l'ordinateur.
Le pilotage sera assuré
par M. Anders.
Il guidera la flotte
en plein coeur du soleil.
Je t'aime.
Au revoir.
On se retrouve de l'autre côté.
Êtes-vous William Adama ?
Oui.
- Êtes-vous un officier de la flotte ?
- Oui.
Êtes-vous cylon ?
Désolé, Bill.
Ce sont encore les questions tests.
Il me faut des réponses vérifiables.
Non. Je ne suis pas cylon.
Avez-vous déjà volé de l'argent ?
- Avez-vous déjà volé...
- Arrêtez ces conneries.
Enlevez-moi ça tout de suite.
Aucun job n'en vaut la peine,
quel que soit le montant du chèque.
Je préfère consacrer ma carrière,
ou ce qu'il en reste,
à une vieille épave,
plutôt que de supporter
qu'on mette ma parole en doute.
La perfection.
C'est de ça qu'il s'agit.
De ces moments...
où l'on ressent
la perfection de la création.
La beauté de la physique,
les merveilles des mathématiques,
l'exaltation de l'action
et de la réaction.
C'est à ce genre de perfection
que je veux être associé.
Tu es sûr de ton choix, Galen ?
Oui, j'en suis sûr.
Les gens me fatiguent.
Humains, Cylons, peu importe.
Demain, le dernier Raptor
me lâchera sur cette île
que j'ai trouvée au Nord.
Il y fait froid. C'est en altitude.
Il n'y a personne.
Bonne chance.
Si ce qui est arrivé à Cally
était arrivé à Ellen,
j'aurais fait la même chose.
Je croyais que Bill venait.
- Il est aux chiottes.
- Charmant.
Commande-moi à boire, chéri.
T'arrête pas.
Ce soir on fête ta retraite
et tout le temps que je m'apprête
à passer avec mon mari.
Ça te pose pas de problème ?
Tout ce que j'ai toujours voulu,
c'est être avec toi.
Pas qu'une poignée de week-ends
et deux semaines de permission par an.
Mais tout le temps.
Toi et moi.
Ensemble dans une maison,
sous une tente.
Sans-abri et à la rue.
Juste être ensemble.
Excusez-moi.
Me lâche pas !
À nous !
Ils sont si nombreux.
Attends !
Je veux...
mieux les voir.
C'est...
un monde vraiment magnifique.
A-t-il un nom ?
La Terre.
Ce n'est pas la Terre.
La Terre est une chimère.
Une chimère
qu'on a poursuivie longtemps.
On l'a mérité. C'est la Terre.
D'accord.
La Terre.
Ça me va.
J'ai du mal...
à respirer.
Tu veux les voir de près ?
Oui, je...
j'adorerais.
Bien sûr.
- Regarde.
- Quoi ?
- Pourquoi ? Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Regarde-moi.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Passe ton bras autour de moi.
Papa ?
J'ai peu de temps, fiston.
Je comprends.
Qu'entends-tu, Starbuck ?
Rien que la pluie.
Attrape ton arme et rentre le chat.
Vous devriez y aller.
Le premier souvenir de mon père,
c'est lui s'envolant
dans un grand avion,
et moi me demandant
quand il reviendrait.
Il ne reviendra pas cette fois.
Non,
il reviendra pas.
Moi non plus.
Où tu vas ?
Je sais pas.
Je sais juste que j'en ai fini ici.
Mon voyage s'achève,
et ça fait du bien.
Toi et moi.
Ici...
et maintenant.
Sur la table ?
Je te mets au défi.
T'es pas cap.
- Pas cap ?
- Ouais, pas cap.
D'accord.
Un truc est cassé.
Je ferais mieux d'y aller.
J'ai été enchantée...
Lee Adama.
De même, Kara Thrace.
Et toi ?
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Aujourd'hui,
c'est le premier jour
du reste de ta vie, Lee.
Eh bien,
j'ai toujours imaginé qu'après ça,
je la jouerais...
calme,
détendu.
En passant le reste de ma vie
à en faire le moins possible.
Et maintenant qu'on y est ?
Je veux explorer !
Je veux escalader une montagne.
Je veux traverser les océans.
Je veux...
Qu'est-ce que je raconte ?
Ça promet d'être épuisant, je délire.
Adieu, Kara.
On ne t'oubliera pas.
Ça va ?
Sean, c'était une charmante soirée.
Délicieuse.
Mais ça ne se reproduira pas.
- J'ai fait...
- Non.
Ce n'est pas toi, tu as été parfait.
- Alors viens...
- Non.
Tu peux partir.
Désolée.
Allô, ici Laura Roslin.
J'ai un message pour...
le maire Adar.
Dites-lui que j'accepte
de participer à sa campagne.
Merci.
Jusqu'au bout.
Quoi qu'il arrive.
Jusqu'au bout.
Il y a tellement...
de vie.
Le continent est fertile.
C'est plus sauvage
que les 12 colonies réunies.
Je cherche un endroit calme
pour une cabane.
Et peut-être un jardin.
J'ai pas la main verte,
alors j'espère que tu l'as.
Ici.
Je vais la construire ici.
Y a de quoi faire sur cette planète.
- Je suis plutôt bon chasseur, tu sais ?
- Bien sûr.
Pourquoi tu te moques ?
Le chevreuil, sur Caprica.
Arrête, c'est pas juste.
N'écoute pas maman.
Papa est un grand chasseur.
Non, maman t'apprendra la chasse.
La vraie chasse.
Et je t'apprendrai
à construire une maison
et à cultiver.
D'accord, maman t'apprendra ça,
mais je t'apprendrai à chasser.
Hera...
ça ira, pour elle ?
Elle a survécu.
- Grâce à vous.
- Tous les deux.
C'était ça ?
Ce que Dieu attendait de nous ?
Ses plans sont sans fin.
- Génial.
- Mais je pense qu'on peut dire...
qu'à partir de maintenant,
vos vies seront moins...
agitées.
J'ai réfléchi.
Je dois pouvoir t'aider, finalement.
Pour ce que tu m'as demandé.
Jeter un oeil au système de défense.
- Mon employeur t'en sera reconnaissant.
- Je le fais pas pour lui.
Je le fais pour toi.
Qu'est-ce que tu en dis ?
Je serai très reconnaissante.
Nous verrons ça.
Parce que si ça se sait,
je peux dire adieu à ma tête.
Je compte sur ta discrétion.
Ce qu'on ferait pas par amour.
Amour ?
Oui. Enfin...
Tu m'as compris ?
Là-bas. Entre ces deux hauteurs,
j'ai vu un terrain
propice à l'agriculture.
L'agriculture ?
Oui.
Je m'y connais un peu.
Oui.
Je le sais.
J'ai fait les plans de la cabane,
aujourd'hui.
Elle donnera sur l'est.
Tu verrais la lumière qu'on a ici.
Quand le soleil se lève
derrière ces montagnes.
C'est presque divin.
Ça me fait penser à toi.
150 000 ANS PLUS TARD
"Lors d'une conférence scientifique
au Smithsonian Institute de Washington,
"des archéologues
ont fait une annonce surprenante.
"On a découvert le fossile
d'une jeune femme
"qui pourrait bien être
l'Ève mitochondriale.
"C'est le nom scientifique donné
"au plus récent ancêtre commun
à tous les humains sur Terre.
"Elle a vécu
dans l'actuelle Tanzanie,
"il y a 150 000 ans."
Avec sa mère cylon.
Et son père humain.
Mercantilisme, décadence,
fuite en avant technologique.
- Ça ne te rappelle rien ?
- Choisis.
Kobol,
la Terre...
La vraie, avant celle-là.
Caprica avant sa chute.
- Tout ceci est déjà arrivé...
- Une question subsiste.
Est-ce que ça doit
se produire à nouveau ?
Cette fois, je dirais non.
D'où te vient ce soudain optimisme ?
La loi des probabilités.
Si un système complexe
se répète assez longtemps,
une surprise peut finir par arriver.
Ça fait aussi partie
des plans de Dieu.
Il n'aime pas ce nom.
Suis-je bête.
Quel idiot !
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-
<i>Previously on</i> Battlestar Galactica
- You must be... Lee.
- Hi, I'm...
A girlfriend stealer for a brother.
- Nice.
- Never stole his girlfriend.
He's a really bad liar right here.
There's been a terrible accident.
Your sisters and your father
were all killed.
How about you, love?
- Bet you charge a lot more than that?
- Shut your filthy mouth.
Stop being so disgusting.
This is your father, Gaius.
I found your father
a new place to live.
The last time I saw him,
he seemed happy.
Bill, I've been having
that dream again.
If that's me lying there,
then what am I?
She took these
from her own mortal remains.
The blood on these dog tags
is 100% proof positive match
for one Kara Thrace.
And you think there's some kind
of meaning in these musical notes.
I'm just groping mostly.
Looking for patterns,
trying to see what comes to me.
She's a half-human, half-machine
object of curiosity
that holds the key
to our continued existence
somewhere in her genetic code.
So let's get a tube in her
and get her ready.
Based on the coordinates
we got from Sam,
we have determined
that the Cylon colony is located here.
The colony's bound within
the gravity well of the black hole,
but maintains a stable orbit.
This right here
is our only parking spot.
Point blank range.
Leave only one way in and out,
then make it impossible
to get past the gates.
Let's get to work.
Can I have your attention, please?
I'm going to be asking for volunteers
in the rescue of the child Hera.
There is a line
running down this deck.
Volunteers,
move to the starboard side.
Everyone else, to the port.
40? I never paid
more than 30 on Picon!
This ain't Picon.
Right, you got me there.
"This ain't Picon." All right. 40.
Show him a good time!
I don't want a lap dance, okay?
Try it! You'll like it!
Keep the 40.
He deserves it. Thank you.
- Are you gonna take the job or not?
- Maybe I should just do it.
I'm letting my pride get in the way.
Now you're talkin'.
I mean, who cares?
It's one hour of your time,
and then you have a whole new life!
A life without midnight watches,
or drills,
or fleet politics,
or the inspections,
or any of that crap.
Life!
You could be here every night!
He won't be here every night.
Can hardly get him here once.
To retirement?
What do you say?
To retirement.
If you don't participate in politics,
then you are giving up your voice.
You're giving up your right
to have a say in the way
that our society is run.
- What?
- You've really bought into that crap?
I do. Proudly.
- And so do you, by the way.
- Really?
That's what the uniform stands for.
It's what we train to defend.
- Oh, you didn't.
- It's true!
That's sad. That's sad.
It's cute, but it's sad.
Lemme guess.
He's going on about voting
and it's importance
to a democratic way of life again.
So, you were listening.
You didn't tell me that your brother
was an idealistic dreamer.
- Dreamer.
- It's sad. Truth is, he's not.
Beneath that romantic exterior
lies the heart of a true cynic.
- Things are looking up.
- This is gonna be fascinating.
Yeah, it's one of the many,
many, many reasons
that him and dad
aren't on speaking terms anymore.
- Come on.
- Family angst syndrome,
I love it. Come on, boys.
- Let's open up some old wounds.
- No, let's not.
Dad believes in the system.
Believes in the uniform.
Believes in something
greater than himself.
Correction, dad believes in himself.
His uniform, his system,
his way of life.
And if you're not with him
in that tiny, little bubble,
- then you might as well not exist.
- If you hate him so much,
why'd you follow in his footsteps?
<i>Touché.</i>
Service gave me four years of college.
I gave the service four years in return.
- Simple as that.
- See?
A cynic.
Right through to that big, empty space
that used to hold his heart.
Honey, I think
I'm starting to like your brother.
You must be Sean.
Yeah, I must be.
I hope so.
- I'll take these. They're beautiful.
- You're welcome.
Do you like white wine?
I do.
Kinda awkward?
- Blind date and all?
- No, it's not, really.
It's just that I have this feeling.
- That I know you.
- Oh?
Really?
There you go, Sean.
- Thank you.
- Welcome.
Wait a minute.
You were one of my students.
Yeah, guilty as charged.
I mean, as soon as Marcie
mentioned your name I knew,
but I didn't wanna tell her.
- You knew I was old enough to be...
- My teacher? Yeah.
But I graduated.
Some time ago.
- Should I go?
- Did I say you should go?
I didn't say that.
The night's young.
Apparently so are you.
Let's see what happens.
Sean Allison.
You wouldn't do it.
For that kind of money?
You're Gods damn right I would.
No, you wouldn't.
Look me in the eye
and tell me that you'd do it.
That you'd do it
for a civilian desk job.
I wanna hear it
come outta your mouth.
Say it!
I frakkin' knew it.
Come on, soldier.
I love you guys.
Because you guys are my family.
My Gods. My Gods. Come on.
- I love you, brother.
- Come on, big boy.
- Legs.
- All right.
In you go.
- You want out?
- Yes, please.
Thank you.
- He never could hold his liquor.
- Unlike his brother.
I'm still standing.
Which means...
It's time for shots.
There's no need
to torture yourself, Gaius.
Just trust in God's plan for you.
What is God's plan for me?
Well, you're following it right now.
Am I?
By taking charge
of mankind's remnants,
and guiding them to their end.
End of what?
Gaius.
- We're ready to go.
- Five seconds, Paulla.
I'm just...
I'm leaving Ishay enough
for two more rounds of injections.
That should keep you on your feet
for another 48 hours.
Two days. Okay.
That's... Should be enough.
You're using up the last little bit
of life you got. You realize that?
Yes.
You've made that clear to me
several times.
Right. That's it.
- We're done.
- Thank you.
And...
Thank you, Doctor.
I'm just doing my job.
No.
You've done much more than that.
You've taken a...
patient who should've died
years ago, and you've...
given her a chance despite cancer,
and the Cylons,
and her own obstinate nature.
And you've...
You've given me
the little time I have left,
and for that you...
You have my...
my heartfelt
gratitude and my thanks.
Well, I...
I don't know what to say.
Don't.
Don't spoil your image, just
light a cigarette and go and grumble.
It's your patient now, Ishay.
Ishay, I...
- I can barely see straight.
- I'm not surprised.
You're so pumped full of drugs
you could float off this bed.
Okay.
Two days?
All right, two days.
The plan's just starting to take shape,
but one thing's clear.
Raptors get the toughest job,
as usual.
This will require
some special piloting skills,
and I mean special.
Threading a needle
while you're on a rollercoaster special.
It seems a little redundant,
the word's come down
that it's a volunteer assignment so...
That's my Raptor wranglers.
Always looking for new
and interesting ways to get killed.
I'm not gonna lie to you, boys,
we are thin on intel on this one.
The Cylons believe
that the most logical place for Cavil
to have taken the girl
is deep into the interior of the Colony.
Best guess.
Right here.
We'll be in too close for nukes.
Same thing goes for missiles.
Now this gonna be strictly
a gun battle.
Like two old ships on the line,
slugging it out at point-blank range.
I want the gun captains to do their job
and start firing immediately.
And to continue to fire
until they run outta ammo.
Then...
I want them to start throwing rocks.
They're gonna have every gun trained
directly on us as soon as we jump in.
If we have any shot at this,
we're gonna have to interrupt
their fire control systems.
And just how the hell is Sam
supposed to help with that?
If we can plug him into Galactica's
dradis, FTL, and C-3 systems,
his mind should then be able
to directly communicate
with the colony's hybrids
once we jump in.
Theoretically, his mind should still
be able to control their commands
and slow down their response time.
Okay.
- Let's do it, I guess.
- There's a catch.
Routing hardware connections
from all systems
into this room is gonna take weeks.
It's a lot easier, faster,
if we move him to the existing lines.
- Okay, where's that?
- Well, best place is the CIC.
I need someone to lead this fleet
who I trust,
and demands universal respect.
So the baseship
and the fleet are yours.
Thank you, sir.
I won't let you down.
I know you won't.
I'll see you at the rendezvous.
If we're not there in 12 hours,
we won't be comin'.
Yes, sir.
Good hunting, sir.
Thank you, Admiral Hoshi.
Still not too late
to flush them all out the airlock.
Take too much time.
I suppose this is what you could
call poetic justice.
Or what goes around comes around.
Either way,
congratulations, Mr. President.
Thank you, Mr. Adama.
And the best of luck.
Admiral Hoshi, sir.
Sir.
- The "sir" is...
- Right. Good luck.
You too, sir.
President of the colonies,
Admiral of the fleet, departing.
All right, last Raptor out, people!
Last Raptor out!
Anyone left behind,
your ass belongs to us!
Great.
Can we tuck this in there?
Listen, I'm not coming with you.
- No, please.
- I made up my mind.
- Our people need you.
- I don't belong to you, Paulla.
I never belonged to you.
You appropriated me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry if I led you to believe...
They're all yours, Paulla, enjoy them.
Pilot, you have your passengers.
- Gaius, don't do this.
- Maybe I'll see you in the next life.
Doctor.
<i>Galactica, baseship actual.</i>
<i>The flag's been transferred
to the baseship,</i>
<i>our vipers are ready
to take over CAP duties for the fleet.</i>
Roger that, baseship,
you have the CAP.
- Safe journey.
<i>- Godspeed, Galactica.</i>
Let's go around the horn.
This is the XO.
All combat stations
prepare to report.
<i>- FTL.</i>
- Go.
We'll set up triage here.
Just prep the table the way that I do.
<i>Weapons.</i>
<i>Go.</i>
Separate out the wounded.
Those we can save,
and those we can't.
- <i>Engineering.
- Go.</i>
How will I know?
Take this marker.
Put an X on the forehead
of those who are too badly hurt.
You'll know when you see them.
<i>Main battery.</i>
<i>Go.</i>
- <i>Engine room.
- Go.</i>
We're next.
<i>Sick bay.</i>
<i>Sick bay's a go.</i>
- <i>Viper wing.</i>
- Go.
<i>Assault one.</i>
<i>Assault two.</i>
<i>Reserve force.</i>
<i>Com 1.</i>
- Sorry.
- Caprica.
<i>Com 2.</i>
What're you doing here?
What...
I don't think you should be here.
Probably been in more battles
than you've have.
Fair point.
<i>Life support.</i>
<i>Emergency system standing by.</i>
I suppose a more pertinent question is
what am I doing here?
What the hell was I thinking?
<i>Secure blast doors on all decks.</i>
Ellen.
I think we're a go up here.
All stations report, sir.
Connect me just to the ship.
This is the Admiral.
Just so there'll be
no misunderstandings later...
Galactica's seen a lot of history.
<i>Gone through a lot of battles.</i>
<i>This will be her last.</i>
<i>She will not fail us</i>
<i>if we do not fail her.</i>
<i>If we succeed in our mission,
Galactica will bring us home.</i>
<i>If we don't...</i>
<i>It doesn't matter anyway.</i>
Action, stations.
- Start the clock.
- Start the clock.
Jump on my mark.
Five, four,
three,
two, one,
mark.
We can't take much of this.
It's time, Sam.
Look through the eye
just with thyself.
The Colony hybrids are offline.
They'll be launching raiders any minute.
Launch all wings.
Birds are away.
All ahead, flank speed!
Three, two, one, hit it!
<i>All hands brace for impact.</i>
<i>Assault one, stand by.</i>
Here they come, let's take 'em!
Light it up.
Assault team on me.
Let's do this. Go. Get out there.
Pressure.
- We've got pressure, sir.
- One atmosphere.
Assault one, we got pressure.
Alpha team, helmets off.
Move out.
Think we lost Cartwheel.
- Dradis is almost useless out here.
- I hope that works both ways.
Any sign they spotted our approach?
I haven't looked at the instruments.
I don't think you want me to start now.
Maybe not.
Let's go weapons hot, Skulls.
We're gettin' close.
- Sure about that?
- No.
But I don't wanna come outta this crap
with cold weapons, either.
Nukes are hot.
You know, this reminds me
of that time back during landing qual.
Battery three, redirect your fire!
Ten degrees starboard!
Concentrate on taking out
the Cylon batteries!
Hotdog, Ladykiller,
<i>concentrate
on taking out Cylon raiders</i>
coming in at 084 carom 229.
Tally, Galactica. We got 'em.
<i>We have a hard seal. Go.</i>
You're gonna just
keep doing the tests.
Even with the Colony
coming down around your ears?
I think you overestimate
their chances.
They may have confused
our hybrids temporarily,
but we have superior fire power
and superior numbers.
And in the end
it's all about mathematics.
Listen to me.
You're pushing too much energy
through the ACS. You gotta back off.
You're gonna blow the main bus.
You hear me?
Sam!
There are secrets within the eyes,
answers within riddles.
Lay off the ACS?
You betcha, Galen.
Hear what your heart wants to deny.
End of line.
You never should've trusted her.
Trust didn't enter into it.
I simply miscalculated her need
to engage in gestures of futility.
We have to assume
that she'll try to make contact
with the colonial forces
aboard the Colony.
- It's time to go on the offensive.
- We must be cautious.
Too much force
could risk killing the child.
Really? Ya think?
Please continue stating
the perfectly obvious.
It fills me with confidence.
I'm proud of you.
What?
For doing this.
For being here
when you coulda just walked away.
I don't think
I ever said it before, but...
I always wanted to be proud of you.
Guess I always felt
that was the only thing missing.
All the pieces
are falling into place.
You will hold the future
of Cylons and humans in your hands.
I will?
You see them?
Reconnect me!
Cylons just blew a hole
into deck 21!
Frakkin' Centurions'll be pouring in
at platoon strength!
On me, let's move!
Wait.
Tell the Old Man...
I owed him one.
Doesn't change
anything you did, though.
We all make our choices.
Today I made a choice.
I think it's my last one.
It's really touching.
Can we get the hell outta here?
You should know
your Raptor's been destroyed.
You can't go back that way.
- Well, that's not the plan.
- Can we not tell her the plan?
Right.
Missed the trap seven times
in two days.
It's a new galactic record.
Regs say
that you've washed out, rook.
- Time to look for a new career.
- What do you want me to do, sir?
Do you want me to beg for my billet?
Do you want me to crawl?
I want you to land your frakkin' bird
without diggin' holes into my deck.
How's that?
How about being a pilot?
An officer worthy of the uniform.
Take your job seriously.
Don't let your personal life
get in the way.
I've read your jacket.
Your whole story.
I know that your family's gone,
and I know that you have no home.
All you got is the service.
And it's slowly slippin' away.
All because...
you're wrapped up
in survivor's guilt.
You're trying to find
a way to wash yourself out.
The Doctor's in.
Check your neuroses at the door.
Lotta people have died on this ship.
There's a lotta ghosts
running around here.
You don't wanna pull them
into your cockpit with you.
Because you won't come back alive.
Do you understand that?
Yes, sir.
I don't think you do, but...
maybe someday you will.
As for now...
make the trap tomorrow, rook.
Dismissed.
Thank you, sir.
I owe you one.
A lot of other people owe me one,
but you know what,
very few people ever pay back.
Especially the ones
that owe you their lives.
I'll pay you back one day, sir.
When it really means something.
You do that.
Okay, get this guy cross-checked
and set me up a large-bore IV.
I need a set of wipers on this marine,
and a CT scan over here on this one.
And get him the frak out of here!
It's all right.
You've gonna be all right.
He's gone.
All right, you'll be...
You're gonna be all right.
- What took you so long?
- Stopped for coffee.
How many other Raptor teams made it?
Haven't seen anybody else.
Okay, back the way we came.
Guns. Point.
Yes, sir.
We're retracing our steps.
Say again, Apollo!
I cannot copy
your last transmission!
This is the XO.
Red stripes to repel boarders.
Deck 21, portside, frame 10.
<i>We got the prize!
Repeat, we have the prize!</i>
<i>Formed up with assault 2
and are heading back to base.</i>
Roger that!
ETA five minutes.
Actual out.
Fire!
We got a fire up here!
- Connect me to command unit!
- Yes, sir!
Move reserved forces
to guard airlock.
Assault force is en route.
ETA five minutes.
I repeat, ETA five minutes.
We're friendly!
Hold your fire!
Friendlies!
Rangel, Peters, form up!
- Sorry 'bout that.
- Doc, you did good.
- Thank you.
- We'll take Hera.
Right.
- Come on.
- Come on, bring Hera.
Get him outta here.
Fall back, fall back!
What?
Hera.
Clear!
Oh, God!
Check this out.
Keep that *** back here!
Hang on.
- Hera!
- Hera, come back here!
- Hera!
- Look at me!
- Go.
- No, you'll bleed out.
Go!
Go!
I'm empty.
Two rounds.
I've been here before.
Yes.
- We're... we're supposed to...
- Go into the opera house.
- This one's still alive!
- Get him the hell outta here!
They got the girl.
They've got the little girl!
This makes it a lot easier.
I just take the little girl
and I'm outta here.
Not a chance.
Cavil, we won't let you take Hera.
You know that.
I know nothing of the kind.
I know I'm gonna watch you
chase your tails across the universe
- for another four years.
- That's not gonna happen.
This thing is the key to my people's
survival and I'm not leaving without it.
Hera's not a thing.
She's a child.
And she holds the key
to humanity's survival as well.
And how do you know that?
I see angels.
Angels in this very room.
Now I may be mad.
But that doesn't mean
that I'm not right.
Because there's another force
at work here.
There always has been.
It's undeniable.
We've all experienced it.
Everyone in this room has witnessed
events that they can't fathom,
let alone explain away
by rational means.
Puzzles deciphered in prophecy.
Dreams given to a chosen few.
Our loved ones dead.
Risen.
Whether we wanna call
that "God" or "Gods",
or some sublime inspiration
or a divine force
that we can't know or understand,
it doesn't matter... It doesn't matter.
It's here.
It exists.
And our two destinies
are entwined in its force.
If that were true...
and that's a big "if"...
how do I know this force
has our best interests in mind?
How do you know
that God is on your side, Doctor?
I don't.
God's not on any one side.
God's a force of nature...
beyond good and evil.
Good and evil, we created those.
And we'll break the cycle.
Break the cycle of birth,
death, rebirth,
destruction, escape, death.
Well, that's in our hands...
and our hands only.
Requires a leap of faith.
Requires that we live in hope...
not fear.
If I leave you this girl,
that means
the destruction of my people.
How does our extinction fit into this
picture that you want us to believe in?
We'll give you resurrection.
Saul!
You give us Hera
and we will give you resurrection.
But the war ends here.
You leave humanity in peace...
and give up the pursuit now
and for all time.
Agreed.
How do we know
we can take your word for it?
You don't.
You have to make a leap of faith.
It's your call, Bill.
I'll back you either way.
I'm losing a lot of men out there.
I can do something
about that right now.
- Give me that phone.
- Patch him through.
Hello, it's me, Cavil.
Stand down!
All forces cease fire immediately.
Galactica, Hotdog.
<i>They're pulling back.</i>
<i>Repeat.
They're pulling back!</i>
Everyone... stand down.
I'm as good as my word.
Admiral...
Viper wing's aboard.
We lost four birds.
Assault force is aboard.
We've lost seven Raptors.
What are they doing?
Each of them knows
part of the secret to resurrection.
They're gonna interact
with the dataflow in the water.
And... I don't know.
It's a lotta complicated
technical talk
about sharing the information
among the five of them
and then transferring it
over to the Colony somehow.
Now, for a moment,
we're going to know everything
there is to know about one another.
Looking forward to that.
There are certain things that...
That we've all done.
Certain things that...
people would be shocked
to learn about.
Hey, I don't mean to rush you, but you
are keeping two civilizations waiting!
Let's...
let's just all agree that no matter...
what we learn about each other,
we're all Cylons, and we're
all capable of making mistakes.
You're forgiven
for all your dark secrets.
Let's do this.
Any word?
We're getting the data now.
It looks right.
They're downloading
the resurrection designs now.
- They've broken off the download.
- It's a trick! Open fire!
Frak!
We've gotta get outta here!
Starbuck, jump the ship!
I don't have
the rendezvous coordinates!
Doesn't matter!
Just jump us out of here now!
Jump!
Just trust yourself.
There must be some kind
of way out of here.
I thought that if I assign
numbers to the notes...
If that's me lying there,
then what am I?
When I look at you now,
I don't see Kara Thrace. I see...
an angel blazing
with the light of God.
Angel.
Jump!
You're tempting fate.
If I have a fate, then it is set
and thinking about it
isn't gonna make it happen any faster.
Fair enough. But flying...
when you're thinking
about dying and...
It's a bad way of doing business.
You're gonna get scared and you're
gonna start second guessing yourself.
I'm not scared.
You said that you think about...
dying every time
that you get into a cockpit.
Well, hello?
Yeah, but it doesn't scare me.
Like, that's what you don't get.
What, so it's...
Kara Thrace, the fearless warrior,
right?
No, I know... I know fear.
And I get scared. Just...
Just not of dying.
So then what does scare you?
Sorry.
Being forgotten.
- You all right?
- I am fine.
- XO?
- Sir?
Sitrep.
Damage report.
I'm okay.
I'm okay, go.
Sir.
We're mostly here.
The engines... life support...
But there's red lines
through her lateral
structural members.
She's broke her back.
She'll never jump again.
Wherever we are
is where we're gonna stay.
Where have you taken us, Kara?
Glad you could join us, Admiral.
Lieutenant Hoshi suits
me just fine, sir.
Admiral stars turned out
to be a little heavy.
Happiest day of my life when I saw that
Raptor jump into the rendezvous point.
Well, there you have it, Admiral.
The most advanced civilization
we could locate on this planet.
I can't see them
talking to each other.
So either they communicate
a different way or they're pre-verbal.
Judging by the look of their tools,
which are rudimentary to say the least,
I'd suggest that we've found
an early, ritualistic, tribal society.
They bury their dead.
I came across a grave a couple
of clicks back and ran some tests.
Their DNA is compatible with ours.
Meaning we can breed with them.
You got a one-track mind, Doc.
What?
Listen, I'm talking about the survival
of the human race, actually.
Not some get together
with the natives.
You also have no sense of humor.
Right.
Right, I'm sorry.
How's that possible?
Human beings naturally evolved
on a planet
one million light years away.
- The odds against that are...
- Astronomical, yeah.
One might even say
there was a divine hand at work.
Well,
whoever's responsible, we're here.
And here's where we're gonna stay...
With our new families.
My vote is that we clear
everything back to this ridge.
Easy access to the water
down by the river.
In fact, the whole area's
ripe for cultivation.
We should have the preliminary lines
for a city within a day or two.
No.
No city.
Not this time.
What do you propose we do?
We break the cycle.
We leave it all behind
and start over.
You're talking about
a little over 38,000 people...
The entire human race...
With nothing but the clothes
on their backs and some provisions.
It's not the entire human race.
- There are people already here.
- Tribal.
Without language even.
But we can give them that.
I mean, we can give them the...
The best part of ourselves.
But not the baggage.
Not the ships, the equipment,
the technology, the weapons.
If there's one thing
that we should've learned, it's that...
you know, our brains
have always outraced our hearts.
Our science charges ahead.
Our souls lag behind.
Let's start a new.
We'll land civilians
at various points
around the planet.
Our objective will be to spread
the people out as much as possible
to give them
the best possibility of survival.
Supplies will be evenly
distributed throughout the camps.
And locations will be documented
and given to everyone.
I have to say, I'm shocked
at how amenable
everyone is to this notion.
I would have thought there'd be
general uprising at the idea of losing
whatever little creature comforts
we had left.
Don't underestimate the desire
for a clean slate, Mr. Lampkin.
Have you made a decision?
The Sixes, the Eights and the Twos
have decided to stay.
See how we can contribute to the world
before we pass into God's hands.
We'll give the baseship
to the Centurions,
let them find their own destiny.
I think they've earned
their freedom.
And what if they evolve again
on their own
and decide to come back
in a few hundred years and wipe us out?
It's a risk.
But I think setting them free may be
enough to break the cycle of violence.
And it's a risk worth taking.
And I agree.
They've earned it.
Now once the civilians
have been off-loaded,
the fleet will leave the orbit
and rendezvous with Galactica.
The course of the fleet will be plotted
into the nav computer ahead of time.
But the actual piloting
will be done by Mr. Anders.
He'll guide the entire fleet
directly into the sun.
I love you.
Good-bye... Sam.
I'll see you on the other side.
Is your name William Adama?
Yes.
Are you an officer
in the Colonial fleet?
Yes.
Are you a Cylon?
I'm sorry, Bill. We're still
establishing tests for the control.
I need verifiable yeses and nos.
No. I'm not a Cylon.
Have you ever stolen money
from a cash drawer?
- Have you ever stolen money...
- Enough of this crap.
Take this thing off me right now.
No job is worth this,
no matter how fat the paycheck is.
I'd rather spend the rest of my career,
what's left of it,
on a broken down old ship
than have someone sit here
and question my word.
Perfection.
That's what it's about.
It's those moments...
when you can feel
the perfection of creation.
The beauty of physics, you know?
The wonder of mathematics.
The elation of action
and reaction.
And that is the kind of perfection
that I wanna be connected to.
You sure this is what you want,
Galen?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Just tired of people.
Human, Cylons, whatever.
Last Raptor is gonna drop me off
on this island that I found off
one of the northern continents.
It's cold.
It's up in the highlands.
There's no people.
Good luck.
For what it's worth,
if what happened
to Cally had happened to Ellen,
I'd have done the same frakking thing.
I thought Bill was coming.
- He's taking a leak.
- Oh, nice.
Order me a drink, honey.
Keep 'em coming.
Tonight we are celebrating
your retirement
and all the time I'm about to get
to spend with my husband.
Are you good with that?
All I've ever wanted
was to be with you.
Not just weekend liberties
or two week's leave a year.
I mean full-time.
You and me.
Together in a house, in a tent.
Homeless and on the street.
Just be together.
Excuse me.
Don't drop me!
To us!
They're so many.
Wait!
I wanna...
see more detail.
It's...
a very beautiful world.
Does it have a name?
Earth.
It's not Earth.
Earth is a dream.
One we've been chasing
for a long time.
We've earned it. This is Earth.
Okay then.
Earth.
It's fine.
I'm having trouble...
breathing.
Would you like to get
a better look at them?
Yes, I'd...
love it.
I would.
- Watch.
- What?
- Why? What are you doing?
- Watch me.
- What are you doing?
- Put your arm around me. Can you?
Dad?
I don't have much time, son.
I understand.
What do you hear, Starbuck?
Nothing but the rain.
Grab your gun and bring in the cat.
You should go.
You know,
my very earliest memory of my father
was him flying away on a big plane.
And wondering
when he was coming back.
He's not coming back this time.
No,
he's not.
Neither am I.
Where are you going?
I don't know.
I just know that I'm done here.
I've completed my journey
and it feels good.
You and I...
Right here...
Right now.
On the table?
I dare you.
I double-dog dare you.
- Double-dog dare?
- Oh, yeah. Double-dog.
All right.
Something's broken.
I guess I better... get going.
It was nice to meet you...
Lee Adama.
Likewise, Kara Thrace.
So what about you?
What are you gonna do?
Today
is the first day
of the rest of your life, Lee.
Well...
I always thought
when this was all done I would...
kick back.
Relax.
Spend the rest of my days doing
the absolute minimum humanly possible.
And now that you're here?
I want to explore!
I wanna climb the mountains.
I wanna cross the oceans.
I wanna...
I can't believe I'm saying this.
It sounds so exhausting.
I must be crazy.
Good-bye, Kara.
You won't be forgotten.
You okay?
Sean, it's been a lovely evening.
Really lovely.
But I'm afraid
we won't be doing this again.
- Did I...
- No.
No, not you.
No, you're wonderful.
- Come on then...
- No.
You can show yourself out.
I'm sorry.
Hello, this is Laura Roslin.
I'd like you to give a message to...
Mayor Adar.
Tell him that I will...
be joining his campaign.
Thank you.
All the way to the end.
No matter what.
All the way to the end.
So much...
life.
It's a rich continent.
More wildlife
than all the 12 Colonies put together.
Just looking for a quiet little place
for that cabin.
Maybe a garden.
I don't have much of a green thumb,
so I hope that you do.
Right there.
I'm gonna build it right there,
Laura.
Lot of game on this planet.
- I'm a pretty good hunter, you know?
- Yeah, right.
What are you laughing at?
What?
That buck on Caprica.
Okay, come on now.
That's not fair.
Don't you listen to mommy.
Daddy is a great hunter.
No, mommy's gonna teach you
how to hunt.
Real hunting.
And I'm gonna teach you
how to build a house
and how to plant crops.
Okay, maybe mommy will teach you that,
but daddy's gonna teach you how to hunt.
Hera...
will she be all right?
She survived.
- Thanks to you.
- Both of you.
And that's it?
That's all God wants of us?
God's plan is never complete.
- Great.
- But I think it's safe to say...
that from now on
your lives will be less...
eventful.
I've been thinking.
I may be able
to help you out after all.
About that thing
you were asking about before.
Getting a peek
into the defense mainframe.
- It would mean a lot to my employers.
- I'm not doing it for employers.
I'm doing it for you.
How would it make you feel?
I'd be very grateful.
We'll put that to the test.
Because if anyone finds out,
I could get my head cut off.
So I'll count on your discretion.
The things men do for love.
Love?
Yeah, well. You know...
You know what I mean, don't you?
Over there between those two peaks.
I saw some terrain
that looked good for cultivation.
Cultivation?
Yes.
You know, I know about farming.
I know.
I know you do.
I laid out the cabin today.
It's gonna have an easterly view.
You should see the light
that we get here.
When the sun comes
from behind those mountains...
It's almost heavenly.
It reminds me of you.
"At a scientific conference this week
at the Smithsonian in Washington,
"the startling announcement was made
that archeologists believe
"they have found fossilized remains
of a young woman
"who may actually be
Mitochondrial Eve.
"Mitochondrial Eve is the name
scientists have given
"to the most recent common ancestor
for human beings now living on Earth.
"She lived in what is now Tanzania,
"over 150,000 years ago."
Along with her Cylon mother.
And human father.
Commercialism, decadence,
technology run amok.
- Remind you of anything?
- Take your pick.
Kobol,
Earth...
The real Earth before this one.
Caprica before the fall.
- All of this has happened before...
- But the question remains.
Does all of this
have to happen again?
This time, I bet no.
Never known you to play the optimist.
Why the change of heart?
Mathematics, law of averages.
Let a complex system
repeat itself long enough,
eventually something surprising
might occur.
That too is in God's plan.
You know it doesn't like that name.
Silly me.
Silly, silly me.
Frakking series finale.
So say we all!
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>
We haven't been properly introduced.
l'm Leoben.
l'm looking forward to spending time with
you. We have lots to talk about. It'll be fun.
Congratulations, Commander.
The <i>Pegasus</i> is your command.
<i>(Skulls)</i> Hey, l am picking up
a large planetary body.
It's habitable. We may have just
found a world that can support human life.
l know in my gut that settling on
this planet means disaster for humanity
and l will not say otherwise
to win an election.
l take the office of President
of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol.
l will sign my first executive order,
requiring to immediately
establish settlements
on the planet we have come to know
as New Caprica.
If you want to move down there, go ahead.
Go down and cat around with all the men.
Saul, l want you.
<i>(Cally) At last, a safe haven</i>
<i>we can call home.</i>
Oh, my gods.
<i>It's a Cylon fleet. They found us.</i>
- <i>(Apollo) We have to get out.</i>
- We can't leave all those people.
There's nothing we can do.
We're in no shape for a fight.
- <i>(Adama) They'll be wiped out.</i>
- <i>(Apollo) We have no choice.</i>
<i>We need to get out of here right now!</i>
<i>(Adama) Begin jump prep.</i>
<i>We're leaving.</i>
But we'll be back.
The Cylons just jumped into orbit.
The fleet's jumped away. They've left us.
On behalf of the people
of the Twelve Colonies...
l surrender.
l'm looking for Kara Thrace.
<i>(distant screaming)</i>
<i>(door unlocks/opens)</i>
<i>(clears throat)</i>
Do you know...
that every time
they take you out of this cell,
we come in here and we change
those little hash marks
on your little calendar
you're trying to hide?
<i>(laughs)</i>
Potatoes, gravy.
Even some carrots.
Heavenly Father, we thank you
for the bounty of this table.
- <i>(Ellen)</i> Yes. Yes.
- <i>(Cavil groans)</i>
<i>(Ellen)</i> Come on. Don't stop.
Come on. Come on.
You son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!
<i>(Cavil)</i> Oh! Argh! Aaaargh!
<i>(sighs)</i>
Oh! <i>(laughs)</i>
Oh, boy.
<i>(grunts/laughs)</i>
<i>(Chief)</i> All right, we're armed.
They're inbound. Let's move!
l need a knife.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
l must say, l quite enjoyed that.
<i>(grunts)</i>
l'm so glad.
And, uh...
when do l get what l want?
l believe that's happening right now.
We reviewed your case today...
and l must say there was great
disappointment on the review committee.
<i>(clears throat)</i>
Come on.
We gotta get you processed.
It'll take an hour or so.
Bureaucracy must be served. But if you're
lucky, you'll get home by dinnertime.
Colonel.
Come on.
l'm not gonna
hold this door open forever.
<i>(PA) Attention, New Capricans.</i>
<i>Effective now, potable water will be given</i>

Saul!
Oh!
Gods. Gods.
- What did they do to you?
- It's OK. l'm out. That's all that matters.
Let's get out of here.
- OK.
- <i>(grunts in pain)</i>
OK. Ready?
Now!
Oh, for frak's sakes. Come on. Come on!
Is that thing gonna work or what?
Whoo!
- It worked that time.
- Come on. Go, go!
Frakking insurgents.
You look...
so lovely tonight.
l'll see you soon... Kara.
Take your time.
<i>134th day of the Cylon occupation</i>
<i>of New Caprica.</i>
<i>Today is Mars Day.</i>
<i>Somehow it seems appropriate</i>
<i>to honour the god of war</i>
<i>on a day when it feels like perpetual war</i>
<i>is the only realistic prospect for us.</i>
<i>We've had no contact with "Galactica"</i>
<i>since it left four months ago.</i>
<i>But l refuse to believe</i>
<i>that Adama has abandoned us.</i>
<i>Our insurgency has been</i>
<i>striking back against the Cylons</i>
<i>whenever and wherever possible.</i>
<i>Although at times these attacks</i>
<i>seem like futile gestures,</i>
<i>l believe that they are critical to morale,</i>
<i>to maintaining some measure of hope.</i>
<i>But in order for the insurgency</i>
<i>to have a more meaningful impact,</i>
<i>we need to strike</i>
<i>a high-profile target.</i>
<i>It is simply not enough to kill Cylons,</i>
<i>because they don't die.</i>
<i>They resurrect themselves</i>
<i>and they continue to walk among us.</i>
<i>It is horrifying.</i>
<i>The Cylon Occupation Authority</i>
<i>continues to exert complete control over</i>
<i>the city and we remain at their mercy.</i>
<i>The Colonial government,</i>
<i>under President Gaius Baltar,</i>
<i>functions in name only.</i>
Let's review why we're here, shall we?
We're supposed to bring
the word of "God" to the people, right?
To save humanity from damnation
by bringing the love of "God"
to these poor benighted people.
We're here because most of the Cylon felt
the slaughter of mankind was a mistake.
We're here to find a new way
to live in peace, as God wants us to live.
And it's been a fun ride so far.
But l want to clarify our objectives.
If we're bringing the word of God,
then we should employ any means
necessary to do so. Any means.
Yes. Fear is a key article of faith
as l understand it.
So perhaps it's time to instil a little more
fear into the people's hearts and minds.
Let's, uh...
Let's execute Baltar.
What? What?
- That's not gonna happen.
- Just because he's your favourite toy
shouldn't interfere with
the larger issues.
- l think that l have cooperated...
- Gaius is with me.
Anyone who wants to challenge that
will have to deal with me.
If we'd killed him at the beginning,
it might've worked.
Now most humans think of him as a traitor
and would cheer his death.
<i>(Cavil)</i> Fine, fine. We don't kill Baltar.
We round up the leaders of the insurgency
and execute them - publicly.
We round up, at random, groups off
the street and we execute them - publicly.
<i>(Cavil #2)</i> Send a message
that the gloves are off.
The insurgency stops now or else
we start reducing the human population
to a more manageable size.
- l don't know - say, less than a thousand.
- We need to stop being butchers.
The entire point of coming here
was to start a new way of life,
to push past the conflict that separated us
from humans for so long.
And what has it gotten us? It's not like
they welcomed us with... with...
Oh, frak it, never mind.
You're all living in a fantasy world.
Consider the irony in that! <i>(laughs)</i>
Delusional machines. What's the universe
gonna come up with next?
Is it really worth it, Caprica?
Is the love of that man really worth
possibly losing all of this?
If you ever experienced love,
you wouldn't have to ask.
<i>In recent months, the Cylons</i>
<i>have been recruiting and training humans</i>
<i>in an attempt to establish</i>
<i>a human police force.</i>
<i>It is hard to think of</i>
<i>anything more despicable</i>
<i>than humans doing</i>
<i>the dirty work of the Cylons.</i>
<i>Led to believe they were merely</i>
<i>taking the civilian security</i>
<i>out of the hands of the Cylons,</i>
<i>the members of the human police</i>
<i>have since become</i>
<i>an extension of the Cylons'</i>
<i>corporeal authority.</i>
<i>And while their names</i>
<i>are kept confidential,</i>
<i>there's no question some of them</i>
<i>are people we might least expect.</i>
<i>Hundreds of us have been</i>
<i>rounded up by the Cylons,</i>
<i>held in detention,</i>
<i>questioned, tortured.</i>
<i>Others have simply vanished.</i>
<i>In recent weeks,</i>
<i>we've been gaining access</i>
<i>to some very important documents</i>
<i>from a source within</i>
<i>Baltar's administration.</i>
<i>No one knows who</i>
<i>this mysterious benefactor is,</i>
<i>but he communicates with the insurgents</i>
<i>by means of a secret signal.</i>
<i>We pray daily for the men and women</i>
<i>who risk their lives to fight the Cylons.</i>
<i>They have everything to lose</i>
<i>and such little hope</i>
<i>of something to gain.</i>
Hey, Jake.
There we go. Shh.
Looks like Mommy's gonna
get some sleep tonight after all.
You know, sometimes l hate
everything about this place.
But sometimes it's... it's magic.
l gotta go.
l'll be back in a couple of hours.
One of these days you're just
not gonna come back, are you?
You'll just vanish and that'll be it.
We'll never see you again.
And Nick will never know his father.
A couple of hours. Promise.
Uh... good to see you, Colonel.
It's good to be seen.
Yeah.
l know you're wondering,
so l'll save you the trouble.
The eye's gone.
Ripped it right out onto the floor,
picked it up and showed it to me.
It looked like a hard-boiled egg.
Big boom today.
- l hope that was you two.
- Oh, yeah. A heavy Raider, too.
Good men.
What's our next target?
l got these today. They're security plans
for the graduation ceremony
at the New Caprica Police Academy.
These are out of the Ministry files.
Where are you getting this stuff?
l have no idea. The source
won't tell me what their name is.
It's probably safer. We've been getting
stuff like this for weeks.
Humans working for the Cylons.
Makes you want to puke.
All the top Occupation brass is gonna be
at the graduation, even... President Baltar.
- Gaius Baltar?
- Yes, sir.
l think we can get a shot at him. But
it'll be tough avoiding human casualties.
Don't avoid 'em! Send a message -
you work with the Cylons, you're a target.
No boundaries for the Cylons,
no boundaries for us!
Anything we can do to nail that
son of a bitch Gaius Baltar is worth doing.
<i>(grunts with effort)</i>
Where are we on the wireless?
<i>(Chief)</i> Nowhere.
Every day we try and contact the Raptor,
and every day the Cylons
jam the transmission.
l've asked the inside source which of
the jamming frequencies are the weakest,
- but so far l got nothing.
- <i>(Anders)</i> You guys are dreaming.
There's no Raptor there, OK?
There hasn't been one
for the past four months, either.
<i>Galactica's</i> not coming back.
They're not. Accept it.
You watch your frakkin' mouth.
There's a Raptor there every day,
listening for our wireless call.
It's out there because that was the plan
if anything happened.
And it's out there because the old man
isn't just gonna leave us to the Cylons.
The old man left me
to the Cylons, Colonel.
And if it wasn't for my wife being a royal
pain in the ass and refusing to let it go,
l would be dead a year now.
Any word on Kara?
Nothing... in four months.
<i>(rattling)</i>
<i>(door opens)</i>
<i>(Leoben)</i> Hi, honey. l'm home.
You kill me.
l download.
l come back. We start over.
Five times now.
l'm trying to help you, Kara.
l only want you to see
the truth of your life.
The reason you suffered
and struggled so long.
That's why God sent me to you.
That's why God wants us to be together.
You're right.
You're right.
And l hear you. l do.
So thank you.
Thank you for putting up with me.
- l'm so sorry.
- Put it down, Kara.
Just put it down.
- l'm a patient man.
- You're not a man.
And l'm willing to wait.
You just need more time.
l don't need more frakkin' time.
It's never gonna happen.
Of course it's gonna happen. You're gonna
hold me in your arms, embrace me.
You're gonna tell me
that you love me.
l've seen it.
You're insane.
To know the face of God
is to know madness.
l'm going to bed.
Be nice if you joined me.
Either way...
you'll be spending the night with me.
l do love you, Kara Thrace.
Good night.
Let me out!
Let me out of here!
l don't belong here! Let me out!
Let me out!
<i>(pilot) Racetrack,</i>
<i>adjust your centreline 20°.</i>
- <i>(pilot #2) Snowbird Three, in formation.</i>
- <i>(Racetrack) OK, let's nail this exercise.</i>
<i>(Helo) Regroup into deployment</i>
<i>formation and proceed to position one.</i>
Snowbird One to Snowbirds,
drop point in eight seconds.
OK, let's get this deployment bang on.
The admiral's watching every move.
Roger, Kat.
We go on your command.
Bomb bay doors open.
All Vipers break now, now, now!
Deploy drones on my mark.
Three, two, one, mark!
Frak me! Snowbird Four,
what the hell happened?
<i>(Kat) Can the chatter, Snowbirds.</i>
This is the CAG. Abort manoeuvre. l say
again, decoy squadron abort manoeuvre.
<i>(pilot #3) Roger that, leader.</i>
<i>"Galactica", Kat.</i>
<i>It is a mess out here.</i>
<i>We got decoy drones heading</i>
<i>every which way. Request instructions.</i>
Roger that, Kat. You're approaching bingo
fuel anyway. Bring your birds back home.
Belay that.
- Strike my last. Stand by.
- Launch the tanker bird.
Let them practise refuelling
before they recover the drones,
then run the exercise one more time.
Yes, sir.
16 times now, sir.
The next one will be 17, won't it?
Yes, sir.
Launch the tanker.
All units, recover drones
and prepare to run training mission again.
- <i>We're launching the tanker.</i>
- Tanker?
<i>Once you've tanked up, return to position</i>
<i>Alpha and prepare for training run 17.</i>
What the frak are they
doing over there?
This is the commander.
Get the admiral on the line.
Considering how long
our pilots have been in the air,
- l suggest we scrub the training exercise.
- If we can't do this in training,
how the hell are we supposed to do it
with Cylon Raiders on our asses? Tell me!
l don't know how we're supposed to do
any of this crap at half strength!
<i>(Kat) We've had a collision!</i>
- <i>(Apollo) Give me your status, Kat.</i>
- <i>(Kat) Bingo, Wally, speak to me!</i>
<i>(pilot) l'm losing flight control! We got red</i>
<i>lights across the board! l'm in a wild spin!</i>
- <i>l'm losing hydraulics.</i>
- <i>"Galactica", Kat.</i>
Emergency. Requesting priority landing
for two bent birds.
- Pull 'em in.
- Yes, sir.
Roger that.
Kat, bring your birds back.
This whole thing is frakking insane.
We got two ships at half strength,
crews that haven't seen action in a year,
and you're acting like the only problem
is they're not working hard enough?
Have you taken a look at yourself
in the mirror lately?
You're weak, soft.
- Mentally and physically.
- This isn't about me.
You've had four months
to get your act together.
And so far all you've been able to
frakkin' do is whine about how hard it is.
Well, guess what. It's gonna get
a lot harder, do you understand me?
Now, l want you to turn around
and get your fat ass outta here.
Get your men ready,
or l'll find someone who can.
Dismissed!
<i>(man)</i> Stay with him.
Good shot, Anders.
l don't like this one, Colonel. l think
we're the ones crossing the line here.
It's the only way it'll work.
The kid has access and clearance.
We gotta be square.
You can't back out once you start.
l'm not backing out.
It's wrong, Colonel.
You know that, don't you?
He's a soldier. It's not the first time we've
sent a soldier on a one-way mission.
<i>(Chief sighs)</i> This is different.
This is our best chance to take out
Gaius Baltar. It may be the only one.
We're gonna take it.
Ever since they killed Nora...
l got nothing to live for.
<i>(man)</i> All right, Duck!
You look me in the eye and you tell me
that you are committed to this.
l'm committed.
May the gods be with you.
Some things you just don't do, Colonel,
not even in war.
Well, maybe you'll feel different
when you're sitting in detention.
Duck volunteered. He's going.
It's a hard thing to say, but it seems like
l don't know who my son is any more.
The same goes for the crew, the ship.
l feel pretty much alone.
Except maybe for you.
l wish l could go back a year
and tell that Admiral Adama about this.
A year's a long time.
Can l ask you something
very personal?
Do you feel guilty about leaving
the people behind on New Caprica?
l don't do guilt.
You know,
a year ago,
when you put me in this cell,
l was at a crossroads.
l sat in here for weeks,
just consumed with rage
at all the things
that had happened to me.
Then at some point
l realised it was all just guilt.
l was angry at myself
for the choices l had made.
Betraying my people.
Losing the baby.
So, l had a choice.
l could either move forward
or stay in the past.
But the only way to move forward...
was to forgive myself.
l don't think we can survive...
l don't think the fleet or <i>Galactica</i>
or the people on New Caprica
can survive
unless the man at the top
finds a way to forgive himself.
Two pilots almost get killed because
they've been in the cockpit for 11 hours,
and he wants to bust <i>my</i> balls.
"You're soft."
Can you believe that?
What?
Oh, you agree, is that it?
Forget it.
l'm not looking for a fight.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Don't do that.
You got something to say,
come out and say it.
He's right.
You are soft.
l'm not talking about the weight.
You've lost your edge,
your confidence.
You lost your war, Lee.
And the truth is,
you're a soldier who needs a war.
You don't want to hear it because
you think that your father's the soldier,
and you sure
don't want to be like him.
But you are like him.
You're more like him
than you know.
That's one of the reasons
l married you.
OK, it's working. l think.
Is it working or isn't it?
They keep jamming us.
So much for our source
on the inside.
Ten minutes left. And lots of nothing
on the wireless as usual.
Watch for Raiders. The last listening bird
almost got popped by a pair yesterday.
l've almost got it.
- <i>(high-pitched beeping)</i>
- Ow, frak! Turn that thing down!
It's working.
It's working.
Time's up. Spin up the FTL
and get ready to go.
Hold on.
l'm picking something up.
It's a Colonial transmission. It's a low
power signal, but the codes match.
Oh, yeah, we got
a link to the ground.
Send the coded response, spin up
the drive, and let's get back to <i>Galactica.</i>
l've got a signal.
A Raptor just made contact with us.
<i>(Tigh)</i> What's it say?
"Will make contact
this frequency every 12 hours."
"Prepare sitrep for command authority.
Have hope. We're coming for you."
<i>(Racetrack) We made contact! l say again,</i>
<i>we made contact with the ground.</i>
<i>Colonel Tigh has formed</i>
<i>an insurgent group</i>
<i>and they're waiting for instructions</i>
<i>on how to coordinate the rescue effort.</i>
It's gonna be OK.
It's really gonna be OK.
The surveillance pictures
taken by the insurgents.
l think we can match names
to about 50 of these photos,
but our best guess puts
the total police force at around 200.
200?
l wouldn't have believed 20 people
would turn against their own kind.
l want those names.
l want the rest of the names.
That's tough. The Cylons are afraid
the population will go after any human
- who joins the New Caprica Police.
- As well they should.
l know l haven't lived a model life.
l made a lot of mistakes.
l'm gonna need
your protection today.
- <i>(knock)</i> Mr President?
- <i>(Number Six)</i> Morning, Gaeta.
It's time for
the graduation ceremony.
Ah, yes.
The ceremony.
About the ceremony -
there's been a change of plan.
l won't be going.
Security concern.
Don't look so worried.
There'll be other graduations.
Right. OK.
l'll just... let the staff know.
We should call off the strike.
There's no reason to do it
if the <i>Galactica's</i> coming back.
Pass up a golden opportunity
to kill Gaius Baltar?
- Other than that, l fail to see the point.
- Think with your head.
The only chance they have
of getting us off this rock
is if the Cylons are too distracted battling
a full-blown uprising when they get here.
If your source on the inside says
Baltar's not gonna be there, abort.
Otherwise, stick with the plan.
<i>(PA)... poor diet, hormonal imbalances</i>
<i>or neurological disorders.</i>
<i>Many have found relief</i>
<i>at the New Caprica Medical Centre,</i>
<i>where a crack team of physicians...</i>
Hey, Duck.
<i>(man)</i> Fall in!
Good morning...
and welcome to all graduates.
You are the hope.
You are the dream of a new tomorrow
for humans and Cylon alike,
and l salute you for the risks that
you have taken for just showing up today.
<i>Today you begin a new career,</i>
<i>and a new life</i>
<i>as provisional police officers.</i>
<i>And, looking out across this room,</i>
<i>l see that the significance of this new path</i>
<i>is not lost on you.</i>
Congratulations.
It's good to have you with us.
Congratulations, Sergeant.
Congratulations, Captain.
It's great to have you with us.
l'll see you soon, Nora.
- l feel gloomy.
- OK.
<i>(sobs)</i> Oh, my God!
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>
<i>(Leoben)</i> You kill me,
l download, l come back,
we start over.
You're gonna hold me in your arms,
tell me you love me.
l don't belong here! Let me out!
Where are you getting this?
Who's your source?
<i>(Chief) No idea. The source won't tell me</i>
<i>their name. It's probably safer for all of us.</i>
- Mr President?
- <i>(Number Six)</i> Morning.
A Colonial transmission. The recognition
codes match. We got a link to the ground.
- We've got a signal.
- What?
<i>(Chief)</i> "Have hope.
We're coming for you."
<i>(Racetrack) Colonel Tigh has formed</i>
<i>an insurgent group against the Cylons.</i>
<i>They're waiting for instructions</i>
<i>to coordinate the rescue.</i>
It's gonna be OK.
- <i>(Tigh)</i> What's our next target?
- <i>(Chief)</i> l got these.
Security plans for the graduation
ceremony of the New Caprica Police.
Our best guess puts
the total police force at around 200.
l wouldn't have believed 20
would turn against their own kind.
l don't like this one.
l think we're crossing the line here.
He's a soldier. Not the first time we've
sent a soldier on a one-way mission.
<i>Send a message.</i>
<i>Work with the Cylons, you're a target.</i>
No boundaries for the Cylons,
there's no boundaries for us.
We round up the leaders of the insurgency
and we execute them.
Send a message
that the gloves are coming off.
<i>(door opens)</i>
Everyone of importance is being looked at
right now. You're no exception.
l can help you, Laura...
in ways l can't help myself.
l can protect you, but you have to
understand the situation has changed.
The insurgency has crossed the line.
Suicide bombings.
It's abhorrent.
It's contrary to everything
that we believe in.
So you...
you and I, we will...
we will publicly condemn these tactics.
They cannot be legitimised
in any shape or form.
Something scares the Cylons after all.
Using men and women as human bombs
should scare us all.
Desperate people
take desperate measures.
All right, look me in the eye.
Look me in the eye
and tell me that you approve
of sending young men and women
into crowded places
with explosives strapped to their chests.
l'm waiting for you to look me in the eye
and tell me that you approve!
33 people killed and their only crime
was putting on a police uniform,
trying to bring some order
to the chaos out there.
By arresting innocent people in the dead
of night. Detaining them without charge.
- Torturing them for information!
- Wait a minute. Nobody's been tortured.
- Tell that to Colonel Tigh.
- Nobody has been tortured.
We're done here.
l hope you understand
the severity of the situation.
l'd ask you to obey
the dictates of your conscience,
- which is what l've always done.
- Of that l have no doubt.
Please give this lovely lady
her shoes back,
then get her out of here.
<i>(PA) Curfew is in effect.</i>
<i>Severe penalties will be imposed</i>
<i>on anyone found on the streets.</i>
<i>Curfew is in effect.</i>
<i>Severe penalties will be imposed</i>
<i>on anyone found on the streets.</i>
<i>(whispering)</i>
Do you understand your orders?
Everything clear?
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Don't worry.
We have your back.
Did you hear?
The Cylons cut food rations today.
We heard. How long before
the next Raptor transmission?
Two minutes.
You know, they're taking about shutting
down the marketplace. It's a security risk.
We'll shift targets.
You were gonna hit the marketplace?
The market?
Full of civilians. This is crazy.
You know, we need to figure out
whose side we're on.
Which side are we on?
We're on the side of the demons, Chief.
We're evil men in the gardens of paradise
sent by the forces of death
to spread devastation and destruction
wherever we go.
l'm surprised you didn't know that.
<i>(Chief)</i> Contact.
Ready for the sitrep.
Send it twice, just to make sure.
<i>(Cavil)</i> Here are the names of those
to be arrested and sent to detention.
I, uh...
- l know some of these people.
- l'm sure you do.
They're all insurgents, Jammer.
We have to break the cycle of violence.
OK, suit up.
You won't have to wear those much
longer. People will see you as heroes.
<i>(breathes heavily)</i>
Not tonight.
Numbers five through ten,
take the tents to the right.
Follow down to the end. The rest of
you guys gotta keep quiet, OK?
<i>(man)</i> New Caprica Police! You're under
arrest for colluding with the insurgency.
- You're under arrest.
- This is an NCP raid! Get your hands up!
- Ms Cally Tyrol.
- No!
No!
My baby! No!
That's my baby! No!
<i>(cries)</i>
Hey. Oh, no, no, no.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
l got you. l got you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, there you go.
Mommy's coming back. It's OK.
It's OK.
Their numbers are a little thin. It says here
Tigh commands 1,150 armed effectives.
That's a lot less than he should have
if you count all enlisted available there.
Could be taking heavy losses.
They mentioned a crackdown.
Get a breakdown of available pilots
in the insurgent group.
Somebody's gotta fly those ships.
Those ships aren't going anywhere yet.
"Cylons have removed launch keys
from Colonial ships."
"Location unknown."
Came from Tyrol.
- Can we manufacture new launch keys?
- <i>(Apollo)</i> Forget it.
The specs are incredibly sophisticated.
It would take weeks just to do the R & D.
Best option is for the people on the
ground to find the original launch keys.
- Assuming they weren't destroyed.
- No. No way.
Cylons would keep them safe in case
they needed to use one of those ships.
She's right. Keys gotta still be there.
Make a weapons drop to the insurgents.
They know the land.
They've been hitting
the Cylons in the teeth.
Given the tools,
they can find the keys.
No way. The only thing
you've got going for you so far
is the Cylons reduced their defence
perimeter to five baseships.
Put heavy weaponry down there,
they'll know we're in contact.
Call in ten more baseships
and your whole plan's frakked.
- Funny. l thought this was <i>our</i> plan, sir.
- Moving on.
The military plans you have in your hands
are to be with you at all times.
Why'd they pick her up?
She hasn't done anything.
We've got a baby, for gods' sakes.
- l don't know. l'll try to find out.
- How long are they gonna hold her?
Detention is run by a separate ministry.
They don't give us any reasons why...
Godsdammit, Felix! She hasn't
done anything. We've got a baby.
l know, Galen.
- l'm sorry.
- How do you do it?
How do you help them day after day?
How do you look yourself in the mirror?
l gotta get my son. Cameron's watching
him, but she's got problems of her own.
Chief!
l'll see what l can do. l'll see
if there's something l can find out.
Why don't you try and do <i>something?</i>
Hey, you OK?
Jammer, what's going on?
l heard about last night. About Cally being
on one of those lists. l'm really sorry.
Frakking human police, huh?
Bunch of traitors if you ask me.
Some of those guys who joined up, l bet
they're in over their heads, you know?
Especially now
with these suicide bombings...
At first, l bet they thought they were doing
something good. Let us police our own.
They're just frakking idiots.
What did they expect?
You don't know any of those guys?
Any names?
Names? No. N-No idea.
Damn.
What's up with Cally?
Why did they put her in detention?
l don't know. She hasn't done a thing.
l just talked to Gaeta.
Says he doesn't know squat,
or so he says.
- Gaeta's a good guy.
- He's a frakking collaborator.
You know what? When this is all over,
guys like Gaeta are gonna get strung up.
Guys like you and me,
we're gonna be there tying the knots.
Making 'em tight.
It's been a couple of ugly days.
l know you don't care about that,
but life means something to us, so...
l've decided to show you
just how precious life can be,
how even in the worst of times,
it can restore your faith.
Remember that breeding farm
on Caprica?
l remember
l blew the frak out of the place.
It wasn't a total loss.
We were able to salvage certain things.
Certain medical samples.
Like your ovary.
What's that?
This... is Kacey.
Kacey, this is Kara.
Your mother.
Hi.
Good girl.
<i>(Dualla) Unbelievable.</i>
- What?
- Admiral's putting boots on the ground.
Wants to send an officer as a liaison
between us and the Resistance
to coordinate the rescue op.
- Makes sense. What's the problem?
- It's who he's sending.
- He's frakking kidding with this, right?
- l wish he were.
Hoshi, l want a Raptor ready
in five minutes on the hangar deck.
- Inform the flagship l'm coming aboard.
- <i>(Hoshi)</i> Aye, sir.
- What are you gonna do?
- What l should've done a long time ago.
- You can't do this. She's a Cylon.
- Well, l trust her.
- That's a mistake.
- Well, it'll be my mistake, won't it?
You're gambling with the lives of everyone
on this ship, everyone on my ship.
l don't need a lecture from you
about the responsibilities of command.
We're done here.
l'm not finished.
This entire plan is a reckless gamble.
You have the right to risk the lives of the
men and women under your command.
But you are risking the lives
of the entire human race.
- l'm trying to save the human race.
- No. That's what you're not seeing.
The human race? That's the 2,000 people
huddled in those civilian ships
that got away when the Cylons
came back. They're the safe bet.
We should guard their survival
like after the attack on the Colonies.
- Sharon can penetrate Cylon defences.
- It's not about her.
The Centurions can't distinguish her
from other humanoid models.
Did you know that?
They were programmed that way.
The Cylons didn't want them becoming
self-aware and suddenly resisting orders.
They didn't want a robotic rebellion on
their hands. You can appreciate the irony.
- Dad!
- l know what you're saying.
But we have a responsibility
to the people that we left behind.
Remember what Roslin said.
Our first responsibility
is to the survival of humanity.
We can't lose sight of that.
Over the last year, we've...
Iost sight of almost everything.
We got... soft.
But if we go back to New Caprica now,
and we lose,
it's over.
Humanity just stops.
And an admiral's stars don't give you
the right to make that gamble.
You're right, son.
Make plans to resume the search for Earth
with <i>Pegasus</i> and the civilian fleet.
- With <i>Pegasus?</i> What about <i>Galactica?</i>
- l know why we left those people behind.
l know that it was their choice
in the first place to be down there.
And l realise that the survival of
the human race outweighs anything else.
But this time...
l can't live with it.
l can't face it.
Maybe l'm a coward.
But l'm going back.
- Dad, you won't have a chance.
- l'm going back, son.
Once l fertilised your egg, we transferred
it to a woman who carried it to term.
She was pretty, funny.
Great smile. You would've liked her.
Although her mother died during
childbirth, Kacey's heart never failed.
l guess she gets
that will to live from you.
l've seen her path.
It's difficult, but rewarding. She'll know
the mind of God in this lifetime.
She'll see patterns that others do not see.
She probably got spiritual clarity from me.
She'll be hungry soon.
There's food on the table.
- You wouldn't let your own child starve?
- It's not my child.
- l don't even know if it's human.
- Half-human. You know she's yours.
You just won't admit it.
Where the frak are you going?
Take this with you.
Hey! Don't leave me alone with this.
- <i>(door closes)</i>
- Frak.
l don't know who or what you are,
but l do know this.
l'm not your mother.
l don't care that it's effective.
l don't care that the Cylons can't stop it.
It's wrong.
No more suicide bombings, Colonel.
You understand?
What, are you working
for the Cylons now?
l'm sorry. There's no excuse for that.
You see, little things like that,
they don't matter any more.
In fact, not too frakking much
really matters any more.
l've got one job here, lady,
and one job only. To disrupt the Cylons.
Make them worry about the ant hill
they've stirred up here
so they're distracted and out of position
when the old man shows up in orbit.
The bombings,
they got the Cylons' attention.
They really got their attention,
and l am not giving that up.
<i>(Roslin)</i> We are talking about people
blowing themselves up.
You know, sometimes l think
that you've got ice water in those veins
and other times l think
you're just a naive little schoolteacher.
l've sent men on suicide missions in two
wars now, and let me tell you something.
It don't make a difference
whether they're riding in a Viper
or walking out onto a parade ground -
in the end they're just as dead.
So take your piety and your moralising
and your high-minded principles
and stick 'em someplace safe
until you're off this rock
and you're sitting in your nice cushy chair
on <i>Colonial One</i> again.
l've got a war to fight.
Let's go. Move it.
- This way. Off-Ioad the rest.
- Let's go to isolation.
<i>(Sharon)</i> The detentions are just causing
more resentment and more enemies.
l know. We don't have another option.
We have to show
suicide bombings won't be tolerated.
Excuse me, sir.
Can l talk to you for a moment?
Yeah, sure, Jammer.
l'll catch up with you.
Sir, l don't know
exactly how to broach this.
Nor do l know exactly what
l expect you to do about it.
But, um, l thought, you know,
since we were...
- Since we were back on <i>Galactica...</i>
- Yeah, Jammer, just spit it out.
We picked up Chief Tyrol's wife
in the last raid. Cally.
She's in detention.
l think she's on a list.
Frak!
- <i>(Kacey screams)</i>
- <i>(thump)</i>
Kacey?
<i>(door opens)</i>
<i>(Leoben)</i> Kara.
Hi, Cally. It's me - Boomer.
l wish l had a gun.
<i>(sighs)</i>
Are you all right?
Physically, l mean.
What do you want from me?
Look, a lot's happened...
in everyone's life.
But l want you to know... l want you
and Galen to know that l'm happy for you.
Especially since you started a family.
Something him and l talked about
once before.
Can you get me out of here?
l don't know. l have nothing to do
with internal security. It's...
Then frak you, Sharon,
you stupid frakked-up toaster!
How many times
do l have to shoot you?
If you can't help me,
then just go away
and leave us alone!
<i>(PA) All human personnel</i>
<i>prepare to present ID</i>
<i>before passing through security scanner.</i>
Have your IDs out. Keep coming.
Everyone, have your work IDs ready.
Step on up.
Work IDs out. Straight ahead, move it.
Hey, you! Open your bag.
Open your bag.
Stop her!
23 Cylons critically wounded.
14 had to be euthanised.
They had casualties, too.
Four human dead.
Who gives a frak about that?
Pardon my language.
The power substation was crippled.
Half the city's without power.
Estimates put repairs at two weeks.
Still think we're being
too hard on the humans?
We have a very serious,
very straightforward problem.
Either we increase control
or we lose control.
That's a fact.
We think it's time for stronger measures.
We agree.
We agree.
We agree as well. How about you?
- We agree also.
- Most of us do, anyway.
Enough.
What's this?
This orders the executions
of all the detainees on the next page.
- It requires your signature.
- My signature?
You're the president.
Read it later. Sign now.
Just cos you've decided to do this doesn't
mean you need to drag him into sin.
Don't you lecture me about sin.
l didn't commit the first act
of Cylon-on-Cylon violence in history.
- What's she talking about?
- She crushed my head in with a rock.
- Interesting she didn't tell you.
- l had to do it. l'm not proud of it.
This is all very interesting.
Very edifying. Sign the order.
- You don't need my signature.
- <i>(Number Three)</i> We do.
We're here as allies
of the government of the Colonies.
Everything we do requires your signature.
They're worried what "God" might think
if they commit murder.
They're covering
their existential asses.
l won't do it. All right? l won't do it.
You'll have to salve your consciences
some other way.
- Then we'll find another president.
- <i>(cocks gun)</i>
Stop this!
This is crazy!
- Dear God.
- She'll be back.
But if he pulls that trigger now,
you won't.
Sign it! Sign it! Sign your name!
Sign it! Sign it!
<i>(Number Six)</i> There's nothing
you can do, Gaius.
But it'll be OK.
It's you.
Help me.
You have to sign it.
They'll kill you if you don't.
Sign it! Sign it! Sign it!
Sign your name!
- Sign it!
- l can't.
l won't.
You can't force...
Sometimes you have to do things you
hate so you survive to fight another day.
<i>(Adama)</i> Raise your right hand
and repeat after me.
- "I, Sharon Agathon..."
- I, Sharon Agathon...
- <i>"...do</i> pledge my faith and my loyalty..."

Congratulations, Lieutenant.
l never thought
l'd live to see the day.
Me neither.
Looks good on you.
Belongs on you.
This uniform...
It means a lot to me, Sharon.
l know it does, Helo.
It means a lot to me, too.
l won't betray it.
Bird checks out, Lieutenant.
Thanks.
Can l ask you a question?
How do you know?
l mean, how do you really know
that you can trust me?
l don't.
That's what trust is.
Good on you, Lieutenant.
Whew!
That was really <i>something. (laughs)</i>
l thought you might like that.
But you... you didn't do
the twist this time.
What's that deal you did right at the end?
What do you call that?
You mean the swirl.
Oh, the <i>swirl. (laughs)</i>
Boy, that's really something.
Well, you said you wanted
something memorable.
Hm.
How is Saul?
Fine.
When's his next meeting
with the insurgents?
No point denying it, Ellen.
We know he's their leader.
Why do you think
we let him out of detention?
l thought it was because of the twist.
Well, yes, that too, for sure.
But having him active with the Resistance
presents us with certain advantages.
- l don't know anything about...
- Let's just consider your denials as read.
Shall we? l want a specific place,
l want a specific time,
for a very high-level meeting
of the insurgency leadership.
And if l don't get it,
we pick up Saul again,
and this time
he'll lose more than an eye.
Tomorrow, the <i>Galactica</i> is going to
send two Raptors, several marines,
Tomorrow, the <i>Galactica</i> is going to
send two Raptors, several marines,
and a ground liaison officer will brief us
on the rescue mission
- and coordinate our evac plans.
- l'll be damned.
It's really happening.
Who's the liaison officer?
- Sharon.
- l hope that's your idea of a joke.
Admiral Adama has given her a uniform
and a billet. She is a serving officer,
which is more than you can say about us,
technically speaking.
The old man's lost his mind, all right.
- Where's the rendezvous?
- Uh, they left that up to us.
OK, here's my suggestion.
If they jump into
Breeder's Canyon out here...
<i>(knock at door)</i>
Come.
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Ellen.
As l was saying, if they jump in here they
won't get picked up on Cylon DRADIS.
That's a long way out there.
A lot of ground to cover by foot.
<i>(Anders)</i> l realise that.
l'll meet them halfway - here.
There's good cover from the air.
It's pretty isolated.
We gotta be sure. It may be the most
important meeting we're ever gonna have.
Colonel, l'm sure. This is the place.
The Cylons will not find them here.
All right, give me the map.
You got the message memorised?
All the wireless freqs?
All right, then give me the message, too.
l'll do that, Saul. Don't get up.
Thanks.
<i>(Anders)</i> l've assembled a team.
We've been out half a dozen times.
We have provisions for a couple of days
and access to running water.
l know that place like the back
of my hand. This is gonna work.
Gaius? Gaius!
Did you sign this?
- Tell me you didn't.
- Not now.
This is a death warrant!
Have you seen the names on this list?
Do you have any idea what they're
about to do? Are you listening to me?
- l didn't have any choice.
- What the hell's the matter with you?
There are over 200 names on this list.
Have you even looked?
- Look at the names, Gaius!
- l've seen them!
l've seen them, all right?
There was nothing l could do.
<i>(man)</i> Move! Move! Move!
You do triple digits.
You can do that. Let me see.
<i>(woman)</i> Laura Roslin?
Come with us, please.
Killing Tyrol's wife will only embitter him
against us. He's head of a labour union...
Let's be honest. You don't think
there's any reason to kill any of them.
- Right.
- Well, we made a decision.
All of us. Like when we listened
to you and Caprica Six
when we came here
to start this new and glorious chapter.
This has nothing to do with
executing Cally.
No one enjoys the thought of mortal
death. But she tried to murder you.
Maybe it's gods' justice.
Need a lift, Mr Vice President?
l guess so.
l haven't seen much of you lately.
Been busy?
Well, not much to do in detention.
How long have you been held?
Four months. l told Baltar l wouldn't have
any part in collaborating with the Cylons
and he got a little pissed.
He's a little pissed at me, too.
Jump complete. Right on target.
l'm dropping down to the landing point.
There's some heavy turbulence up ahead.
Follow the river.
Make sure you hug the bank.
<i>(Sharon)</i> OK, once we reach
the rendezvous point, stay back.
<i>(Sharon)</i> Go, Panthers!
C-Bucks rule!
Hey, Sam.
- It's been a long time.
- Funny. l feel like l see you every day.
Come on.
Lords,
please don't take her life.
It was my mistake.
Don't punish her for it.
It was an accident, Kara.
Nothing more.
Kacey?
Kacey, oh, my gods.
Honey.
- Let them stretch their legs for a minute.
- Yes, sir.
Let's go! All right, everybody out.
Five-minute rest break.
Come on, move!
Everybody out! Five-minute rest break.
Come on, let's go!
Come on, five minutes.
Everyone out. Let's go.
Tell me something, Laura.
Last year?
You tried to steal the election, didn't you?
Yes, l did, Tom.
<i>(laughs)</i>
Oh.
- l wish you'd gone through with it.
- Me, too.
We'll wait until nightfall before we
go back. There's a system of tunnels.
- Our level is under...
- Shh!
Did you hear that?
Down! Get down!
- <i>(shouting)</i>
- <i>(gunfire)</i>
You. Over here.
Run. Run.
Don't look back. Go!
<i>(gunfire)</i>
- Bingo. Let's...
- This just in...
- <i>(groans)</i>
- Lightning.
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>
l can't figure it. Weeks in detention,
then suddenly they let me out.
l want a specific place,
l want a specific time
for a very high-level meeting
of the insurgency leadership.
<i>And if l don't get it,</i>
<i>we pick up Saul again.</i>
And this time...
he'll lose more than an eye.
<i>(man)</i> The child's life
must be protected at all costs.
The first Cylon-human hybrid.
It truly is a miracle from God.
We lost her.
We did the best we could, but she's dead,
and that's all there is to it.
She's so beautiful.
You understand, Maya,
this adoption requires absolute secrecy.
You have my word.
There's a Raptor out there every day
listening for a call,
and it's there because the old man
isn't gonna leave us to Cylons.
"Will make contact this frequency
every 12 hours."
"Have hope.
We're coming for you."
Cylons removed launch keys from
colonial ships. Location unknown.
Best option is that Saul and people on the
ground get their hands on the originals.
Admiral's decided
to put boots on the ground.
He wants to send an officer as a liaison
to coordinate the rescue op.
- Makes sense. What's the problem?
- It's who he's sending.
This plan is reckless. You are risking
the lives of the entire human race.
Plan to resume the search for Earth with
the <i>Pegasus</i> and the fleet. l'm going back.
We round up leaders of the insurgency
and we execute them, publicly.
We round up groups off the street
and we execute them, publicly.
Send a message that the gloves are
coming off. The insurgency stops now,
or else we start reducing the human
population to a more manageable size.
Let them stretch their legs
for a minute.
<i>(Jammer)</i> All right. Everybody, out.
Five-minute rest break. Come on. Move.
You. Over here.
Run. Run!
Don't look back.
Go!
<i>(gunfire)</i>
- <i>(Ellen)</i> Can l help you?
- No. Uh...
- There we go.
- Thanks.
- Sorry.
- No, that's all right. It doesn't hurt.
l appreciate you doing this.
l can't seem to get it right in the mirror.
Saul.
Um... l want you to know...
that l would do anything for you.
Yes.
<i>(clattering)</i>
Cally's on the list.
They're gonna kill her.
- What list? What are you talking about?
- l got this.
l got this from the source
in the administration.
It's a death list,
and Cally's name is on it.
They're rounding up
people in the city.
- Cally's already in detention.
- This is organised by transport vehicles.
Cally's in a group heading
for map coordinate x-ray seven.
l know, but where the frak is that?
How are we going...
Calm down, dammit!
Think clearly here, Chief, or she's dead.
We've already figured out
their map-coordinate system.
It's referred to on the list of Cylon freqs
you got from the last dead drop.
Holy frak! You're right.
l can extrapolate the coordinate system.
Cally's group has to pick up people
in town first. That'll take time.
Take four men
and get there ahead of the trucks.
Chief.
Pull it together. You won't do her any good
if you get caught too.
Besides, the last thing your son wants
is me and Ellen for parents.
Find that list, Chief.
<i>(mutters)</i> Where the frak is it?
Dammit! Dammit!
Where's that frakking list?
OK. It's gotta be here.
It's gotta be.
There. That's it.
Think. Come on.
Here it is. OK.
X-ray seven, one, four, three...
Hey, Chief.
Good day for a walk, huh?
Get two men together.
We're going to Pergamus Flats.
- Talk to me.
- Don't like it. Too much cover on this trail.
We could catch enfilade fire
from there, there and along there.
Let's move out.
l'm going to the rendezvous point.
Place your men on the ridge for cover.
Go, Panthers!
C-Bucks rule!
Hey, Sam.
It's been a while.
Funny, l feel like
l see you every day.
Come on.
<i>(Chief whispers)</i> There's the trucks.
Move down to the ridge.
Move down to the ridge.
You, here.
This is it.
Lock and load.
All right.
What do we see?
Oh, frak me!
- <i>(Seelix)</i> What?
- They got Laura Roslin and Tom Zarek.
- Is there any sign of Cally?
- Not yet.
<i>Galactica's</i> got a rescue plan in place,
ready to go.
My job is to get keys
for civilian ships still on the ground,
then coordinate the rescue with your
evacuation plan. When can we meet Tigh?
We'll wait till night
before we head to the city.
There she is.
There she is!
Oh, my gods!
There she is.
What the frak's she doing?
<i>(Chief)</i> She's making a run for it.
The bulletheads are lining up.
<i>(Chief)</i> It's a firing squad.
Sight in on the Centurions right now.
Cally's in our line of fire.
If we shoot, we're gonna hit her.
Then count to five and open fire.
Skin-jobs.
Should we take 'em down?
Where there are skin-jobs,
there are bulletheads. Bring up the RPG.
- There's a system of tunnels running...
- Shh!
Do you hear that?
<i>(Sharon)</i> Get back!
- Go, go, go!
- <i>(man)</i> Get behind the tree line!
1001,
1002,
1003,
1004,
1005.
- Frak this! We gotta get out of here.
- Stay put. Trust me.
Now!
Thanks.
Shh, shh, shh.
They were waiting for us,
where we thought.
Sir, you better take a look at this.
l found it on a dead skin-job.
It's your handwriting, isn't it?
Yeah, damn right it is.
We were sold out.
Ellen.
<i>(man)</i> Check them out.
Make sure they're OK.
- You all right, Tom?
- Yeah.
Been a while since l had a woman
throw me to the ground.
Not quite as much fun
as l remember.
Hurts, huh? Good.
Then l hope it hurts a long, long time
till you go to Download City.
- You all right down there?
- Oh, my gods!
It's good to see you, Chief.
Good to see you too, ma'am.
What happens now?
Where do we go from here?
We're going home. We're going home.
Admiral Adama's on his way.
We're getting off this rock.
We're going back to <i>Galactica.</i>
<i>(baby cries)</i>
<i>(baby screams)</i>
Don't worry about it, Gaius.
- It's all right. It doesn't matter to me.
- You can stop that right now, OK?
My ego's not so fragile as all that.
These things happen...
or they don't happen.
So what shall we talk about?
Shall we talk about your day?
How was your day, darling?
How was your day at the office?
My office.
Any news?
No?
Well, let me tell you about my day,
because it was a hoot.
l had the most fascinating chat
with one of the Dorals.
He's got this theory
about sanitation being the key
to regaining human trust and confidence.
Something about...
toilet paper.
No, lack of toilet paper.
That's it.
If people could
wipe their bums properly,
there'd be a measurable uptick
in the polls.
Four months of this, Gaius.
Four months of watching you
slip further and further down
into this well
of self-hatred and loathing.
Do you know
what l've given up for you?
Do you?
Do you know,
what with the occupation and everything,
l can't really say
l've given it that much thought recently.
Don't go.
Please.
That doesn't look so bad.
Hey, there's something
that l wanted to, um, say to you.
l'm sorry that l left you alone.
l didn't mean for you to get hurt.
l was upset with myself
and not you, OK?
Uh...
Grown-ups
do stupid things sometimes.
We get, uh,
caught up in our own little world
until it's almost too late.
<i>(door closes)</i>
You have no idea
what l'm saying to you, do you?
OK. Time to take a nap.
Don't be afraid.
l know who you are, what you are.
Poor thing.
You must be terrified.
Do you have any candy?
Candy?
No.
Chamalla's so bitter.
Oh, Zeus sees all.
Sees you, Number Three.
Sees your pain, your destiny.
All the gods weep for you.
There is no Zeus.
No other god but God.
Oh, you don't believe that any more.
You don't know what you believe,
and that is why you're here.
It's not true. l don't even know why l'm
here. This is the stupidest thing l ever did.
It is your dream
that brings you to me.
How do you know about that?
l have a message for you
from the one you worship.
He speaks through me to you,
just as he speaks in your dreams.
The message is...
the fruit borne of two peoples
is alive.
A child named after the wife and sister
of the all-knowing Zeus.
Hera lives.
That's not true.
The child is dead.
You will hold her in your arms
and you'll know, for the first time,
what it is to feel true love.
But you'll lose
everything you've done here.
Wish l had
some chocolate caramels.
Let's move! We got some people
waiting for their ride down there.
Will you quit looking at me like that?
Like what?
You know like what.
Like we're never
gonna see each other again.
We will.
It's a good plan, Dee.
Take care of the admiral?
Take care of his son.
All right, <i>Pegasus</i> crew on the port side
of the line, <i>Galactica</i> on the right.
"Their enemies will divide them,
their colonies broken
in the fiery chasm of space."
"Their shining days renounced
by a multitude of dark sacrifices,
yet still they will remain
always together."
<i>(all)</i> Always together.
<i>(man)</i> l'll be back before you know it.
- <i>(man #2)</i> See you on the other side.
- <i>(man #3)</i> l'll hold you to that.
That's the third time
you've taken a look at your watch.
- Got dinner plans?
- <i>(chuckles)</i>
No, l was just...
l was just thinking.
Sharon's probably on the ground by now.
l know.
These are your orders.
You'll find the rendezvous point there.
Take the civilian fleet
and wait for me for 18 hours.
If l'm not back in 18 hours
then find Earth.
Yeah, right.
l'll see you at the rendezvous point.
18 hours.
Try not to be late.
l'm getting old.
l'm a little slow, but l'll be there.
Gods, l wish l could talk you out of this.
You can't. You tried.
- You know, Dad, um...
- Don't.
Don't make me cry
on my own hangar deck.
<i>(sighs)</i>
l'll see you there.
Permission to leave your ship, Admiral.
Permission granted, Commander.
Attention!
Commander of <i>Pegasus</i> departing.
18 hours.
<i>(dog barks)</i>
Hey. Hey.
Jake. Hey, Jake.
Yeah, you don't care who l am, do you?
All God's creatures in your eyes.
Here you go.
Can't sleep?
Bad dreams.
Didn't know
you people had dreams.
Oh, sure.
Everybody dreams, Doc.
That human or Cylon blood?
Cylon.
One of the Fives got pretty shot up today
by the insurgents, but he's gonna make it.
You could've let him suffer.
That's not what l do.
What about the baby?
Sharon's baby, Hera.
When that child died on <i>Galactica,</i>
why did you cremate the body?
It's the first Cylon-human hybrid,
and you threw it in the incinerator?
Oh, it wasn't my decision.
That was the president's call.
l was just following orders.
That's a very funny thing.
Cos this stuff all looks the same.
She said,
"l hope it hurts you for a long, long time
before you go to Download City."
And then they just left me there.
They left me in the hot sun
with a bullet in my guts.
What a noble race you are.
How long were you there
before you died?
Hours.
Eventually, l managed to drag myself
over to some spent shell casings.
l used one of those
to scratch open my carotid artery.
Skin is a lot tougher
than you think.
Now that's... three for me.
Three downloads.
The first, l got a headache, but l could
handle it. Now it's worse and worse.
This time it was like a frakking
white-hot poker through my skull.
It's not worth it.
None of this is worth it.
He's right, you know.
It's not worth it, which is what l believe
l've been telling you all along.
- Caprica, can you please control him?
- Why don't you shoot me?
If that would remedy the situation.
- We need to crack down harder.
- How? Resources are stretched already.
l don't need to listen to this any more.
Consensus used to be so easy.
Now look what they've done to us.
Don't lose hope.
Worst comes to worst,
we can always nuke the city
and be done with it.
Better leave the dog tags.
If they spot 'em, they'll know who you are.
No. You have no idea
how hard l worked for these.
So our best guess puts the launch keys
in the detention centre.
Keep to main streets. Everybody'll think
you're a regular skin-job and avoid you.
But there's a lot of people
looking to gut an unwary Cylon,
so don't let anybody
get close enough to stick a knife in you.
Thanks for the concern.
Makes me feel warm inside.
How are you gonna
find the launch keys?
The data stream
will feed me the location.
Once l get the keys,
you need to distribute them to pilots.
We're on it.
We got pilots standing by.
- <i>(man)</i> Hey, Anders!
- Yeah, come in.
My gods!
What's she doing here?
Get her down below. You keep her there
until after the next briefing.
Wait a minute! No, no.
Wait, listen to me. Please. l can explain.
<i>(Anders)</i> l suggest
you keep your mouth shut.
<i>(Ellen)</i> l want to
speak to my husband.
Connor, let's go.
Get her down.
- OK, l'm outta here.
- Wait, Sharon.
Yeah.
Do me a favour.
Just keep an eye out for Starbuck.
l don't know if she's alive or if she's dead,
but it's been four months.
l'll do what l can.
Yeah.
<i>(Roslin)</i> You must
keep the child hidden at all costs.
<i>(Anders)</i> We keep her on the move,
along with other high-value targets.
She'll never stay in any one location
longer than two or three days.
Sam, l need you
to really hear me on this.
Really.
There is no one - no one -
of higher value
than Maya and her child.
We cannot let them
fall into Cylon hands.
l get it.
How far do you want me to go?
If it looks like
the Cylons will capture them...
No.
Don't let it get to that point.
That's all.
l don't suppose you'll tell me what this is
about. What's so important about this kid?
She may very well
be the shape of things to come.
That's either a blessing or a curse.
- <i>(baby cries)</i>
- l know. Shh.
We've stored munitions
throughout the city.
l can supplement that
with mortars, RPGs,
shoulder-mounted anti-aircraft missiles
aboard the Raptor.
Great. So when we give the signal,
our people attack the air base,
detention centre, power station.
The plan is to sow chaos
the moment <i>Galactica</i> and <i>Pegasus</i> arrive.
- That should help cover the evacuation.
- No <i>Pegasus,</i> just <i>Galactica.</i>
- Why? Why no <i>Pegasus?</i>
- Don't know, sir.
Way beyond my pay grade.
What about your evac plans?
We've assigned 500 block captains
to cover each sector.
Each captain is responsible for guiding
people in his or her sector to their ship.
- Have you rehearsed any of this?
- <i>(Roslin)</i> Indeed.
We've had three dress rehearsals
under the guise of fire and disaster drills.
Be different when the balloon goes up -
explosions, chaos. There'll be panic.
They'll do fine. These people know they'll
be responsible for saving themselves.
All we need to do
is be ready and hope for the best.
- What about Maya and Isis?
- l'm on it. l've got my two best shooters.
They're gonna be their escorts
and make sure they get back to the ship.
l can't tell you why,
but it is imperative
that this woman and her child get off
this planet. l trust you because l trust him.
Ma'am, yes, ma'am.
Saul!
We need to talk.
<i>(man hisses)</i> Toaster!
- She sold us out.
- What?
We were ambushed. The Cylons
knew exactly where we were gonna be.
<i>(both talk at once)</i>
This is the map that l drew for you.
l gave this to you in your tent.
You were gonna burn it.
She offered to do it for you.
l got it off a dead skin-job at the ambush.
Do the math!
I... l want to explain, Saul.
- Godsdamn traitor!
- Shut your frakking mouth!
He said... he said he'd kill you.
- Who said it?
- One of the Brother Cavils.
l did it for you, Saul.
It was all for you.
l had to. l didn't have any choice.
Don't you see that?
Drawer three-seven-eight.
What are you doing?
Oh, my God, it's you.
You're betraying your own people.
For what?
- l'm a Colonial officer now.
- You're not one of them.
- l gave them my word.
- That's not what counts.
It's who you give it to.
l'm gonna have to shoot you now.
Hera lives.
What?
Your daughter Hera is alive.
Your new friends tell you that?
They faked her death
and hid her from you.
- You could say anything.
- No, l had dreams. l had strange dreams.
l was having strange dreams
that made me question my faith,
made me question God.
And in the dreams there was a human
oracle, so l went to see Dodona Selloi.
l won't kill you. l'll wound you
so you can't warn the others.
The oracle said that the fruit
borne of two peoples is still alive,
that Hera lives and l would hold her
in my arms and l would know true love.
Put down the gun,
and when l find her
you can hold her too.
Adama wouldn't lie to me.
You're wrong.
You're wrong!
The keys don't seem
to have been damaged.
It looks like the ships have enough tylium
to make at least one jump.
Congratulations, by the way.
l heard it's a boy.
- Oh.
- What's his name?
Nicholas, after Cally's grandfather.
Hey, Chief,
you remember when you helped
Helo spread Hera's ashes?
- Mm-hm.
- You actually saw the ashes?
Yeah, of course. Why?
Nothing.
Just make sure
Cally never lets your kid out of her sight.
<i>(Helo)</i> Sir?
The listening Raptor
just jumped back.
Sharon's got the launch keys.
<i>(phone rings)</i>
Rec room.
Racetrack.
Very well, sir.
It's on.
This is the admiral.
You've heard the news.
You know the mission.
You should also know there's
only one way that this mission ends,
and that's with the successful rescue
of our people off of New Caprica.
Look around you.
Take a good look
at the men and women
that stand next to you.
Remember their faces,
for one day you will
tell your children and your grandchildren
that you served with such men and
women as the universe has never seen.
And together
you accomplished a feat
that will be told and retold
down through the ages
and find immortality
as only the gods once knew.
l'm proud to serve with you.
Good hunting.
- Begin jump prep.
- Action stations.
Set condition one throughout the ship.
Stand by for combat jump.
This will mark new territory.
Don't do it!
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>
l have a message for you.
The fruit borne of two peoples
is alive.
A child named after the wife and sister
of the all-knowing Zeus.
Hera lives.
That's not true.
l don't suppose you'll tell me what this is
about. What's so important about this kid?
She may very well
be the shape of things to come.
The Cylons knew
where we were gonna be.
<i>(both talk at once)</i>
This is the map that l drew for you.
l gave this to you in your tent.
You were gonna burn it.
She offered to do it for you.
I... l want to explain.
He said he'd kill you.
- Who said it?
- One of the Brother Cavils.
This is Kacey.
Kacey, this is Kara.
Your mother.
Our people attack the air base,
detention centre, power station.
The plan is to sow chaos
the moment <i>Galactica</i> and <i>Pegasus</i> arrive.
No <i>Pegasus,</i> just <i>Galactica.</i>
These are your orders. Take the civilian
fleet and wait for me for 18 hours.
If l'm not back in 18 hours
then find Earth.
You know the mission. You should also
know there's only one way that it ends,
and that's with the successful rescue
of our people off of New Caprica.
Good hunting.
Hoshi's working on updating our map
coordinates for the search for Earth.
Civilian captains want to meet with you.
They have questions, problems.
Talk to me, Lee.
l'm having trouble...
accepting this.
l know.
But we have to push forward,
keep the fleet together,
find Earth.
- That's our duty.
- There's still a chance they'll come back.
Your father has pulled off
more than a few miracles in his day.
l know that.
And l haven't given up hope.
Yes, you have.
l saw the look on your face
when you came back from <i>Galactica,</i>
like you were
never gonna see him again.
Am l that easy to read?
Just to me.
He's taking on too much
for one half-strength battlestar to handle.
That's not opinion,
that's military fact.
He's not coming back from this.
None of them are.
All we can do
is make plans for the future.
We have to survive.
We have to find Earth. If we don't, there'll
be no one to remember William Adama,
or a battlestar named <i>Galactica.</i>
That is our charge to keep.
To keep humanity going,
no matter what the cost, no matter...
no matter who we leave behind.
You can do this.
You can get us there.
You are commander of this fleet
and you will guide us to safety.
And you will do it,
no matter the cost,
because you're an Adama.
Did l say how proud l am
to serve with you?
Not in so many words, no.
Well, l am proud to serve with you,
Lieutenant.
And to call you my wife.
Now, let's talk about map coordinates,
meeting with ships' captains.
l lost three men. If that sergeant wasn't
on her game, they'd have killed us all.
l know, godsdammit! You don't have to
keep running your mouth about it. l get it.
Get this. If Sharon had been killed, not
only would we not get the launch keys,
but the Cylons would know
we were in direct contact with <i>Galactica.</i>
This whole plan - the fate of
this whole city - would have fallen apart.
- Do you understand that, Colonel?
- l get it.
Good.
Hey.
You know
what has to be done here.
You don't want to do it. l understand.
But believe me, someone is gonna do this.
Now, it would be better
for her sake if it was you.
l had to do it, Saul.
l had to.
It was all for you.
And l want you to know
that l would've done anything to save you.
l know. It's all right.
Everything's gonna be all right.
No, you don't understand.
l got you out of detention, Saul.
It was me.
l got you out.
l went to see them - the Cylons.
l finally got to the one in charge.
And l got him to notice me
the way men notice me.
l slept with him.
l felt like puking every time
he put his filthy hands on me,
but l smiled and l faked it
to save you, Saul.
But you listen to me.
l'd do it again.
Frak anybody, do anything.
Even give them the map.
l didn't want anybody to be killed.
l could use a drink.
You've always been there for me
when l need you.
Oh, l'm exhausted.
l feel like l could just curl up here.
l should have listened to you, Saul.
l should have stayed on <i>Galactica.</i>
Don't worry about any of that now.
You just...
- You just go to sleep.
- l'm sleepy.
l love you,
do you hear me?
<i>(sobs)</i>
l mean, l've told you and l've told you,
but to what end?
Too secure
in your smug superiority to listen.
Too comfortable
in your predictions of success
to even consider
the possibility of defeat.
And where are we now?
More to the point,
where's Laura Roslin?
Where's Tom Zarek?
At large.
Whereabouts unknown.
Free, at any rate.
Probably with Colonel Tigh, solidifying
the insurgency's hold over the public.
What would you have us do, Gaius?
Leave.
Pack up your Centurions...
and go.
Please. Go.
And then what? What would you do
if we really just left you here?
Live your lives in peace and never trouble
yourself with thoughts of us again?
Or would you raise your children
with stories of the Cylon?
Mechanical slaves who once
did your bidding, only to turn against you.
Killers who committed genocide
against your race.
And occupiers of this city
until we just ran away.
Would you tell them to tell the story
to their children?
And to their children's children?
Nurse a dream of vengeance
through the years,
so that one day they could just go out into
the stars and hunt the Cylon once more.
Blood for blood.
It has to stop one day.
<i>(distant explosions)</i>
Oh, my gods.
Nice job, Anders.
Come on. Come on.
<i>(siren wails)</i>
OK, that's our cue.
You know what to do.
Rally your people
and get them to the evac points.
Remember the drills and you'll do fine.
Go with the gods. Go! Go! Go!
- Tory, tell Laura l can't thank her...
- Tell her yourself when this is all over.
l wish we were all
as calm as she is.
- Get them to their ship. Go!
- <i>(man)</i> Yes, ma'am.
Come on!
Quick, quick!
Let's move!
Let's move! Let's move!
This is it. We get to the detention centre
and we do not stop until everybody is free.
Everybody knows the rescue points.
Let's load up and we move, right now.
Let's move! Let's go!
Decoy squadron
approaching launch point.
<i>(Kat) OK, this is it, guys.</i>
<i>Stand by.</i>
All Vipers, break...
now, now, now!
Deploy drones on my mark.
Three, two, one.
Mark!
The drone signatures match.
The Cylons should pick up their drones on
DRADIS and read them as two battlestars.
Hey.
For nothing.
- All for nothing.
- We'll start over, Gaius.
A new city
to rise out of the ashes.
It'll be buried.
Buried like the cities of old,
consumed by the wrath of God.
Two battlestars
just jumped into orbit.
Adama's back.
Kat, Racetrack. Two baseships
on DRADIS, bearing 002, carom 015.
- They're launching Raiders.
- <i>Red squadron, Kat. We've done our part.</i>
<i>Kick in the turbos</i>
<i>and let's get the hell out of here!</i>
- <i>(Starbuck)</i> What's going on?
- Insurgents. l'll be back.
- You cannot leave us here.
- It's safest here.
No!
Let's go! Let's go!
- Tom, head to the shipyard.
- You're coming?
My ship's up there.
You sure have a sense of the dramatic.
Hey, wait. Laura. Wait.
You're on <i>Galactica,</i> right? Keep an eye
on her. Don't let her out of your sight. Go!
- See you up there.
- See you up there.
<i>(man)</i> Jump preparation complete.
My board is green.
Ready to jump, sir.
- Stand by to launch blue squadron.
- This is the admiral.
All hands,
brace for turbulence.
Baseships just closed on the battlestar
targets. There's no <i>Galactica,</i> no <i>Pegasus.</i>
Drones.
Decoys.
- The whole thing's a trick.
- Where's <i>Galactica?</i>
Altitude 99,000,
falling like a rock.
- Launch! Launch them all!
- Stand by, FTL.
- <i>(man) Clear for launch.</i>
- Well, this ought to be different.
- They're clear!
- Stand by!
Jump!
Vipers!
Everybody, hold! Hold!
Hotdog, Redwing, l see friendlies
pinned outside the shipyard.
Roger. Redwing, target the tower.
l've got the gate. Pulling in hard.
<i>(Chief)</i> Incoming!
That's it! Let's go!
Let's go! Go! Go!
Let's go! Go!
Move! Move!
Godsdammit.
Come on! Move! Move, move!
Move! Let's go! Come on!
Move! Move, move, move!
- Fire in the hole!
- <i>(woman)</i> Fire in the hole!
Everybody, let's move!
To the shipyard!
Move! Move! Hustle!
Kara. Oh, gods!
No, no!
l'm gonna get you out of here.
l'm gonna get you out of here.
Make damage report to Combat.
Batteries, report weapons status.
DRADIS?
Back online.
Cylon baseships
are coming out of the nebula.
Just as we expected.
Cylon Raiders are still scattered.
They're coming after us
without fighter cover.
If we draw the basestars away from
the planet, the Colonists may escape.
Hang on. Two more baseships
just jumped into orbit.
We got four baseships out there,
Admiral.
We can't hold off four.
Pass up the cord!
- Hold still.
- Connect the other side right away.
We lost thrusters.
We can't take more hits to port
or we're looking at decompressions
in sections 36 to 48.
Jump drives?
Then that's it.
It's been an honour.
<i>Galactica, Pegasus.</i> Let us take
some of this work off your hands.
Get your FTL ready
and we'll take care of the rest.
- Fire up that main battery!
- <i>(man)</i> Roger that!
Damn you, Lee.
Keep working on those FTLs.
Get 'em online!
The Cylons will redeploy
as soon as they recover.
Thank you, Lee.
<i>(Dualla)</i> They're coming about
to bracket us.
Steady as she goes.
Take us right into the centre.
- We won't last long in there.
- No.
<i>(Starbuck)</i> Put me down!
Put me down!
- Stop, stop! Put me down.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shh! Shh!
Kara, shh.
- Is it really you?
- It's really me, but we don't have time.
We're going to the ships and we're
gonna get off this frakking planet.
- Where's Kacey?
- Who's Kacey?
- Kacey. She's my daughter.
- Kara, who's Kacey?
- She's my daughter!
- Kara, no! Kara!
Godsdammit! Kara, no!
Out of the way!
Come on!
Godsdammit, Kara, no!
We've lost control of the situation
on the surface.
There's a Heavy Raider standing by
ready to evacuate us.
We're agreed.
Evacuate the entire facility.
l'll stay behind
and set off the nuke.
<i>(explosions continue outside)</i>
You should go as well, Caprica.
And you.
l don't think you'll want to be here after
we've gone. There's a place for you too.
For me?
Well, you were right and we were wrong.
There should be some reward for that.
Gaius, we should go.
l just want to sit here and die.
You're gonna get your wish, Gaius.
The ships are getting off the ground.
They're jumping away.
Only a few left now. FTL's back online.
<i>Pegasus</i> is taking a hell of a pounding.
l don't think she has a plane in the air.
Lee left all his planes
to guard the civilian ships.
He knew this was a one-way trip.
He'll evac before the end.
- You sure?
- Land our birds!
Let's get the hell out of here.
<i>(Helo) All wings, Galactica. Come home.</i>
<i>Landings authorised. Repeat, come home.</i>
All hands, all hands,
get ready to jump.
- l believed in you.
- Whoa, whoa. Gaeta.
l believed in the dream
of New Caprica.
- Gaeta, we all did.
- No! No.
Not him. He believed in
the dream of Gaius Baltar.
The good life - booze, pills,
hot and cold running interns.
He led us to the apocalypse and...
and l turned out to be...
<i>(Baltar)</i> An idealist.
There's no sin in that.
Everything you say about me is true.
Every word.
But you have to listen to me.
The Cylons have a nuke
in this complex.
Nobody, and l mean nobody, is getting off
this planet alive unless l stop D'Anna.
- She'll kill you.
- Then she'll kill me.
Or it can be down to Mr Gaeta.
Either way,
the human race dies with me.
<i>(Number Six)</i> Gaius.
Go ahead, shoot.
What are you waiting for?
Please.
Please.
l'm begging you, please.
You have one chance to put things right,
do you understand me?
Get the frak out of here!
Stop that nuke!
- Go!
- Gaius, let's go!
<i>(Apollo)</i> Set main batteries to autofire,
cycle B. Lock engines ahead flank.
This is the commander. Abandon ship,
abandon ship. All hands, abandon ship.
Report to evac Raptors
and jump to rendezvous point.
Good work
and l'll see you on the other side.
All right, people, let's move.
Out! Let's go!
You too, Commander.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Kacey!
Kacey!
Kacey, honey,
where are you?
Kace...
l knew you'd be back.
l saw it.
Come here, Kacey.
- Say the words.
- Let me take her.
- Say them.
- What words?
You know what l want. l want to hear you
say them. And l want the rest of it.
Just like l told you.
Fine.
You win.
l love you.
Say it again.
l love you.
Now the rest.
Was it everything
you thought it would be?
That and more.
l'll never forget this moment.
Neither will I.
l'll explain later.
Let's move.
- Are you sure she's in here?
- Positive. l saw her go in.
<i>(baby cries)</i>
Frakking liar!
<i>(baby cries)</i>
<i>(baby continues to cry)</i>
It's her, Gaius.
The first of God's new generation.
Hera.
Shh, shh, shh.
It's a miracle.
God spared her.
- <i>(baby cries)</i>
- Shh.
Hera.
Can l hold her?
<i>(Number Six)</i> No.
She won't set off the nuke,
not any more.
Come on, Gaius.
We have to go.
Let's go.
- <i>(man #1)</i> All aboard.
- <i>(man #2)</i> Check up front.
All right.
l'm ready to go.
People, let's go. This way. Stand on the
deck until we can get you to new ships.
Come on, people, all the way down.
All the way down, people. Let's go!
Oh, my gods.
Captain?
- l thought you were dead.
- Yeah, so did I.
- Who is this?
- Yeah, l was gonna ask that myself.
- <i>(Starbuck)</i> This is...
- Kacey?
Kacey!
Oh, my little girl!
Mommy missed you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
When the Cylons took her,
I... l thought...
But you saved her.
Gods bless you.
- <i>(man)</i> Thank you, sir.
- Welcome aboard. Welcome.
Welcome aboard.
- l guess you didn't understand my orders.
- Never could read your handwriting.
<i>(Tigh)</i> Permission
to come aboard, sir?
Hey.
Permission granted.
You did it.
You brought 'em home, Saul.
Not all of them.
- l'm sorry.
- <i>(crowd chants "Adama")</i>
<i>(crowd continues to chant)</i>
We're still double-checking
the fleet's manifests, but...
it doesn't look like Maya
made it off of New Caprica.
What about the baby?
l was there when the two guards left
to take them to their ship.
l don't know what happened.
l'm so sorry.
l let you down and l know that.
No, you didn't.
It's not your fault.
This is bigger than us.
This is life.
<i>(PA) All procedure support teams,</i>

<i>All procedure support teams,</i>
<i>stand by for ship assignments.</i>
More religion.
Your soul is mine.
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>
You're gonna hold me in your arms
and tell me you love me.
You're insane.
You kill me,
l download,
l come back, we start over.
l don't belong here!
Let me out!
Some of the guys who joined the Cylon
police, bet they're in over their heads.
One day, when this is all over,
guys like that are gonna get strung up.
Guys like you and me,
we're gonna be there tying the knots,
making 'em tight.
Where are you getting this stuff?
l've no idea. The source won't tell me
their name. It's probably safer for all of us.
- Mr President?
- Morning, Gaeta.
This is a death warrant.
Have you seen the names on this list?
Got any idea
what they're about to do?
l got this from the source
in the administration.
It's a death list,
and Cally's name is on it.
Run. Don't look back. Go!
We were ambushed. The Cylons
knew exactly where we were gonna be.
- l didn't do anything!
- This is the map l drew for you!
<i>You were gonna burn it,</i>
<i>but then your wife offered to do it for you.</i>
<i>You know what has to be done here.</i>
<i>It would be better for her sake</i>
<i>if it was you.</i>
<i>(sobs)</i>
Come on! Move!
Move, move!
Evacuate the facility. You should go
as well, Gaius. There's a place for you too.
<i>(Connor)</i> Walk.
<i>(chokes)</i>
<i>(sobs)</i>
Evidence for the following charges
have been presented to the Circle -
that you carried arms
for the enemy,
that you carried out raids
against the human population
and that, during one raid, 23 people
were killed by you and your men
during the assault on the temple.
It's not true!
Names of the people killed by you and
those under you. Look at those names!
Connor.
The Circle examined the evidence
and found you guilty of treason
and crimes against humanity.
Do you have anything to say
before sentence is passed?
- l was trying to help people.
- You didn't do a very good job, did you?
- All right, let's just get this over with.
- l helped people. l helped lots of people.
Chief. Chief.
Chief, l helped Cally.
l saved Cally.
- l saved Cally.
- What do you mean, you helped Cally?
l let her go
when they were gonna shoot her.
l took her out of line, l said,
"Go. Run like hell." And she did.
She ran and she got away. Because of me,
Chief. l helped Cally. l saved Cally.
Cally did get away, somehow.
They killed 23 people
during the temple raids.
12 men, eight women
and three children.
Children!
My son is on this list.
His name is right there. And that
frakking son of a bitch put him there.
So saving Cally,
if that happened,
does that make up for
killing my son?
Answer the question, Chief.
Does saving Cally
let him off the hook for killing 23 others?
Did you do this, Jammer?
Did you kill these people?
<i>(whispers)</i> Answer me.
<i>(whispers)</i> It was crazy down there, Chief.
You know that.
You make these decisions so fast.
You're making an arrest
and people come out with their hands up,
but sometimes it's a trick. They say
they're surrendering and then open fire.
We thought they were insurgents.
It wasn't until after,
when we saw the bodies...
What was l supposed to do?
No, it doesn't.
Under the Articles,
the punishment for treason is death.
Sentence confirmed and carried out
on this, the third day
of the Second Exodus.
- l'm sorry!
- There's too much frakking talk.
<i>(sobs)</i>
l'm sorry!
<i>(mouths)</i>
My son,
Kevin,
he was only seven years old.
Come on.
Connor. Let's go.
This isn't what l signed up for.
<i>(low chatter)</i>
<i>(whispers)</i> Good boy.
Shh. Good boy.
Hey, sweetie.
- Am l on watch?
- No, no, you're fine.
Here, give him to me.
Come here, come here.
Come to Daddy. Hey, buddy.
Hey, buddy. There you go.
l know. Mommy's
much more comfortable than me, huh?
- Cally?
- Mm-hm?
When you were down on the planet
and you ran away from the trucks,
did anybody help you?
One of the NCP goons, or anybody?
<i>(sleepily)</i> What? No.
Wait, yeah.
Somebody told me to run.
It probably was
one of those goons.
But l haven't thought about it since.
Hey, how did you know about that?
l mean, why do you ask?
No reason.
Go back to sleep.
OK.
In my opinion,
it wasn't his fault.
l hate to admit it, but the admiral's right.
He was in an impossible situation.
l'd have probably done the same
in his position.
Well,
if that's the way it has to be,
then that's the way it has to be.
No hard feelings?
None.
Mistakes were made -
of that, there's no question.
But the past...
is the past.
l think we can all agree
that we'd like to move on.
You fools.
You're being too lenient. He betrayed you.
He actively sought your deaths.
Doesn't that matter to you?
Don't you have any self-respect?
<i>(coughs)</i> l wouldn't bother.
They can't hear you.
- Don't make me angry, Gaius.
- You wouldn't like her when she's angry.
<i>(Roslin)</i> l've always wanted you.
- Oh, no.
- What?
- l'm dreaming, aren't I?
- Yes, you are.
<i>(sighs)</i>
Hey.
- Did you get any sleep?
- <i>(clears throat)</i>
Sleep when you're dead.
Nice.
What is all that?
<i>(sighs)</i> l got my gear out of storage.
Never thought l'd see
any of this stuff again.
Hey.
- What?
- Come here.
Just don't, OK?
<i>(woman)</i> Excuse me, guys.
So, Mr President, how long before the new
Quorum of Twelve can be sworn in?
Uh... three days.
l will personally place your name
in nomination as my vice president.
Once they confirm you, l submit
my resignation and you get sworn in.
The whole thing
should take less than an hour.
Stepping down without a fight?
That means you want something.
Why not put your cards on the table and
let's see if it's a price l'm willing to pay.
Well, l'm a realist.
l never had any illusions
about remaining in office for very long.
And the admiral's made it clear
he'd like nothing better
than to put me in a cell
if l try to hang onto power.
He's trying to do you a favour. You and l
both know how impossible it would be
to govern this fleet
without the military's backing.
l agree.
That's why we're here.
Even so, l want to be included
in the new government.
l don't want to be on the outside
looking in any more.
OK.
OK.
You stood up to Baltar
on New Caprica.
You nearly lost your life for your trouble.
This fleet needs that kind of courage.
The vice-presidency is yours.
If you want it, Tom.
Well, thank you.
You're welcome.
You gotta be kidding.
Who gave this man permission
to enter the CIC?
Admiral's orders, sir.
Communications took some hits and
Mr Gaeta has offered to help with repairs.
Well, isn't that nice?
A man can turn his coat,
collaborate with the enemy,
contribute to the deaths of thousands,
but the old man needs his phones fixed
and suddenly all is forgiven.
If Cylons find us,
we'll need everyone.
Cylons found us, Mr Agathon. Your friend
Gaeta was on the welcoming committee.
Hey! Look at me!
Since you're here, maybe you can
help me out. l'm missing something.
l lost it in detention.
Since you're so buddy-buddy with
the Cylons, maybe you know where it is.
How about it?
- Do you know where my eye is?
- <i>(Adama)</i> Saul!
Admiral.
Back to work.
- Walk with me.
- Yeah.
We have a lot of work in the next couple
of weeks. Get some sleep, get ready.
l'm ready now. l may be rough
around the edges, but l can hold my own.
And you can tell that toaster-Iover over
there that l am still the XO of this ship.
- Let's go.
- Get your hands off me.
- You're embarrassing yourself.
- It's you who should be embarrassed.
Letting one of Baltar's henchmen
walk around like nothing's happened.
Go sleep this off.
That's an order.
Oh, yeah.
Just go to sleep.
Forget about it all.
Just forget about everything.
Well, l'm not forgetting.
l'm not gonna forget.
Charges are carrying arms
for the enemy in a time of war,
shooting three civilians
and collaboration with the enemy.
- l call the vote.
- Guilty.
- Guilty.
- Guilty.
Guilty.
Yeah. Guilty.
Guilty.
The vote being unanimous,
the sentence is death.
Chadwick's aboard the <i>Monarch.</i> l'll
contact our man there. He'll take care of it.
Anybody got a cigarette?
- How many more of these have we got?
- 57.
Three days.
That's all the time we've got.
Then stop wasting it. We all knew
there was a clock when we signed on.
These fraks are so guilty
they stink.
l could get through 50 of these things
in an hour.
You think we're a bunch of thugs
handing out punishment on a whim?
Jammer wasn't airlocked cos you <i>thought</i>
he was guilty. There was evidence.
You read the witness reports.
He was tried and convicted by this Circle.
This is about justice.
You got that? Justice!
Yeah. OK, OK.
<i>(Tigh)</i> Hey.
Now, don't get me wrong here.
l like you, Connor. You're a good guy.
Next case.
<i>(Seelix)</i> Felix Gaeta.
Charges are collaborating with the enemy
and crimes against humanity.
l don't want to do this.
Do you think l like it?
l stood beside Gaeta in the CIC
for almost four years. He was like family.
But he was chief of staff to Gaius Baltar,
and that alone is enough to convict him.
l'm saying on this particular guy,
we do not have hard evidence.
We got no witnesses, nothing. All we do
know is he worked for Baltar. That's it.
Yeah, l gotta go with Sam on this one.
We need something specific.
You want specific?
You think Baltar ran things? That guy?
He was the public face, but Gaeta,
he was the brains. Everyone knew that.
He ran the operation. He did the
paperwork. He approved the death lists.
How do you know? Were you there? Did
you see him approve a single death list?
He knew Cally was on a death list.
- What are you talking about?
- Look there.
That's a distribution list,
and there's Cally's name.
And there's Gaeta's name.
He saw her execution order.
It's still all circumstantial. We don't know
what Gaeta did when he saw that list.
l gotta go with them on this one. No!
You see a death list, you know innocent
people are gonna die and you do nothing?
He's guilty.
l call the question.
The question of the innocence or guilt
of Felix Gaeta has been called.
The Circle will vote.
- l vote guilty.
- <i>(Connor)</i> Guilty.
- Guilty.
- Guilty.
- Sam?
- No, don't bother. l'm done.
- We're still voting.
- l'm not.
l'm done. l'm done with this whole thing.
The war's over for me. l'm sorry.
OK. That's fine.
- Still 4-0, Chief. What's your vote?
- No, wait. We need six votes.
- Screw that.
- No, screw you!
We're a jury. We need six votes.
If we don't have six votes, l'm out too.
He's right.
We need a sixth.
How are you, Gaius?
l'm alive.
l suppose that's something.
Thank you.
You'll have to excuse me.
l'm slightly confused.
How long have l been here, exactly?
Three days.
Three days?
So it's taken you three days
to remember where l was?
No one's forgotten you, Gaius.
It's just there's been controversy about
whether you should've been let on board.
l can't believe
there's still a question of my value.
There'll always be a question.
You are a human.
Now, look...
l helped you.
l gave you Sharon's child.
Yes, that's right, you did.
And the child's rescue
did weigh in your favour.
However, the vote's deadlocked -
three in favour of your being
allowed to stay and three against,
with one model still undecided.
The fact is,
the decision rests with the Sixes.
We're starting to see a rash
of missing persons reports.
We left thousands on that planet.
No, this is different.
These are people known to have survived,
but who have gone missing
since the exodus. Jammer, for instance.
- Deck hand. l saw him yesterday.
- He didn't report at muster this morning.
Bed check negative, sickbay negative.
It's like he just vanished.
- How many people are missing?
- 13, as of today.
Two on <i>Galactica,</i>
11 elsewhere.
Every one of them confirmed as a survivor
by multiple witnesses, then poof! Gone.
Keep me posted on any more
missing persons. l wanna know about it.
Yes, sir.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
l have a date with a jump rope.
Hey, l've dropped half a stone.
Keep jumping.
Hey.
<i>(clears throat)</i>
How you doing?
Well, you know, l'm... making do.
How are you?
l'm good.
Why do you ask?
Well, uh... l heard about your situation.
You were...
Right.
l just try not to think about it any more,
you know?
l'm kinda like you.
Sitting in your cushy little office on
Colonial One, doing all Baltar's dirty work.
Probably never even thought about
what was happening to me, right?
l didn't know about your situation.
- If l had, l would've tried to get you out.
- Mm.
Like l've said about 50 times now, l was
serving the president of the Colonies.
- We all elected him, remember?
- So that's supposed to excuse it?
What do you want me to say?
Maybe l could've done more, but
l thought that, when the Cylons landed,
it was important for me to keep my job
to help from the inside.
Propping Baltar up
and letting them walk all over us?
No, l fed information to the Resistance. l
set up dead drops - there was a dog bowl.
l passed along Cylon positions,
internal memoranda...
Great, Felix.
You're a frakking hero.
Whatever feelings
l had for you have to stop.
l allowed my feelings
to cloud my judgment.
l protected you.
l gave your species
a second chance.
l even turned against a sister Cylon.
And for what?
l'm Cylon, Gaius.
Somehow l lost sight of that.
You are much, much more
than a machine.
You're a person.
A real person.
A woman.
And you're in love with me.
And it hurts.
l know it hurts.
But, believe me,
l am the only one that can make it better.
Don't you see?
l am the only one.
<i>(whispers)</i> No, this has to end.
You need me!
You need me, admit it!
Admit it!
You need me!
And l need you too!
Did you hear me?
l-I need you too.
Maybe l should've started with that.
This is a jury.
l wanna make that clear.
It's not about settling scores
or personal grudges. It's a jury.
We're just dealing
with the worst of the worst -
people who did more than put on an NCP
uniform or make a deal with Cylons.
They're the killers,
the real traitors.
Yeah, but none of this is legal, right?
No, no. It's legal.
You gotta be kidding me.
That's why we need to know right now,
are you in or out?
<i>(clears throat)</i>
- In.
- Good.
We've already been through the evidence,
so just take your time.
You're telling me that Gaeta saw this list
and didn't do a damn thing?
We have no idea of knowing what Gaeta
did or did not do when he saw the list.
The whole thing's like a bad dream, only
we woke up and the traitors are still here.
Guilty.
That's 5-0 in favour of guilty.
It's gotta be unanimous.
Chief?
You're the last to vote.
<i>(door opens)</i>
- Get out of here, Sam.
- l'd like to talk to my wife.
l'd like to do it now.
We already have your vote.
Take a break.
Hey. l quit because l'm not looking
for ways to keep killing people.
- Well, l need this, Sam.
- So, what?
Throwing people out of an airlock
is gonna make you feel better?
Those aren't the people
that kept you locked up.
They'll do. Not just for me,
for every person we left on that planet
because someone has gotta pay. So you
can either get with it or you can get lost.
Is that what you want, Kara?
You want me to leave?
He doesn't wanna say "guilty" because
Gaeta is such a good guy. Right, Chief?
Everyone likes Gaeta so let's let him
off the hook, let's just look the other way.
Well, a lot of good people
had to pay the price for what they did,
choices they made on New Caprica.
Like my wife.
That's right.
Ellen collaborated,
gave the Cylons information
on the Resistance, and she died for it.
Because that's the price
of collaborating with the enemy.
And l liked her a lot more
than l like Gaeta.
Look, Sam,
l'm in a different place now.
I...
l don't know how else
to explain it to you.
l got out of that cell and it's like someone
painted the world in different colours.
And l look at you...
and l wanna tear your eyes out
just for looking at me.
l just wanna hurt someone,
and it might as well be you.
So you should probably go
before that happens.
Baltar signed death warrants,
organised murder squads,
collaborated with the enemy
from day one.
- Baltar, not Gaeta.
- It's the same godsdamn thing.
<i>(Seelix)</i> He's right. A lot of people died
because of them, Chief.
Fine. Guilty.
<i>(Anders)</i> Remember this?
l don't want this any more.
Sam.
<i>(opens door)</i>
<i>(shuts door)</i>
<i>(Seelix)</i> Take him.
Turn around.
On your knees. On your knees!
Felix Gaeta,
you've been tried and found guilty
of crimes against humanity
by a circle of your peers, as authorised
by the president of the Colonies.
If you have any words to offer
in your own defence, now is the time.
Come on, Felix, talk.
We'll listen.
Yeah, that's right.
We'll listen to how
hiding behind Baltar's skirt
was your way
of helping the insurgency.
Say something.
What's the point?
l already tried to explain it.
l'm not gonna beg.
Too bad you didn't grow that spine
four months ago.
Beg.
Beg.
- Beg!
- <i>(Tigh)</i> Thrace.
No! Beg.
Come on. Tell 'em how you were actually
working for the Resistance the entire time.
Come on! Tell 'em all about the important
information you were giving up.
Tell 'em about all the messages
and the dog bowl and...
What? What did she say?
What did she just say?
Get the frak out my way.
What did she just say?
Tell me.
What did you say to her?
There was a yellow dog bowl.
It was a signal.
<i>It meant there was a message</i>
<i>in the garbage dump.</i>
l turned it over. It was a signal. It meant
there was a message at the dump.
<i>(Chief, groaning)</i> That was you!
Oh, my God...
- <i>(Tigh)</i> What are you doing?
- Chief.
There was a yellow dog bowl.
l used it.
We were wondering
who the source was, Colonel.
There's no other way
he could've known.
He's the only other one
that would know about it.
He's why we know about the death lists,
why l saved Cally, why we're on this ship.
He's the one who gave us
the inside information.
There's our source, Colonel.
l did what l could.
l don't know
what else l could've done.
- What the hell is this?
- It's all perfectly legal.
You'll find an executive order authorising
a secret jury of six men and women
to try, sentence and execute
people guilty of extraordinary crimes
or collaborating with the enemy in war.
l signed a death warrant
for every conviction.
Your presidency is a farce.
It stops right now.
If they're guilty,
they'll be tried by a jury of their peers.
They have a jury,
but they don't get lawyers.
They don't get to showboat
for weeks on end.
They don't get to blame the system,
and they don't get lasting fame
as martyrs or innocent people
just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
They just disappear. Now.
In the grey twilight between the night of
the occupation and the dawn of a new era.
You come into office clean,
without their blood on your hands.
Well, thank you.
That's, uh... that's very poetic.
However, you have a problem,
Mr President.
Everyone, by law, is entitled to a trial
with representation. Everyone.
It is not an option to be discarded
at the president's whim.
You think by making the trials public
that you'll find justice?
- Yes, l do.
- Come on, Laura.
You're not that naive. Let me tell you
what will happen if these cases go to trial.
It'll consume this fleet for months,
maybe years.
People will be lining up
to testify against their neighbours.
It'll be a circus,
an entertainment for the mob,
and you'll be signing death warrants
almost every day.
Is that how you want to spend
your next term, Laura?
As executioner-in-chief?
<i>(man)... with every fibre of my being.</i>
With every fibre of my being.
- Congratulations, Madam President.
- Thank you.
Thank you all for once again entrusting
me with this high office of civil service.
Today is a new beginning
for all of us.
We share a unique destiny,
but our future is ours to shape
and our past cannot be forgotten.
<i>A new day requires new thinking,</i>
<i>and while l had intended</i>
<i>on using this occasion</i>
<i>as an opportunity to announce the</i>
<i>formation of a special prosecutor's office</i>
<i>charged with investigating acts</i>
<i>of collaboration with the enemy,</i>
<i>l have decided instead</i>
<i>that a different gesture is called for</i>
<i>on this, the first day</i>
<i>of my next term as your president.</i>
We all feel the need for justice,
and we all feel the need
for vengeance.
Telling the difference between the two
can be difficult at times.
<i>We are all victims of the Cylons and none</i>
<i>of us can be impartial. l certainly can't.</i>
<i>So today l am forming a commission</i>
<i>on truth and reconciliation</i>
<i>to hear our stories</i>
<i>and record them for posterity.</i>
There will be no prosecutions.
l am issuing a general pardon
for every human being in this fleet.
This will not be
a popular move today,
but l truly believe that this is the only way
for us to move forward in strength
in a spirit of healing
and reconciliation.
l thank you
for your continued patience
and courage.
Good day.
Thank you.
<i>(woman)</i> Hey, Chief.
Do you want a seat?
More rebels?
Wanna watch the baseball game?
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>
I, Sharon Agathon, will carry out
the lawful orders of my superiors
as an officer in the Colonial fleet.
Congratulations, Lieutenant.
We're talking about people
blowing themselves up.
l've got one job here, lady,
and one job only.
To disrupt the Cylons, make them worry
about this ant hill they've stirred up here
so they're distracted and out of position
when the old man shows up in orbit.
You know the mission. You also know
there's only one way this mission ends,
and that's with the successful rescue
of our people off of New Caprica.
Evacuate the facility. You should go
as well, Gaius. There's a place for you too.
Captain? Hi. Who's this?
- This is...
- Kacey!
Oh, my little girl!
When the Cylons took her, l thought...
But you saved her!
Gods bless you.
A lot of good people had to pay the price
for choices they made on New Caprica.
Like my wife.
That's right.
Ellen collaborated.
Gave the Cylons information
on the Resistance, and she died for it.
- There's still a question of my value.
- There always will be. You're human.
<i>(Baltar)</i> Good to see you.
l far prefer these picturesque settings
for our little interludes, don't you?
l thought you'd abandoned me
to your Cylon comrades.
Would l do that?
You've always been more unpredictable
than your flesh-and-blood counterparts.
A man that loves women as much as you
should have learned that a long time ago.
l'm a slow learner.
Then take this period as a time
to learn all you can about the Cylons.
- You'll need it in the days ahead.
- Something special on the horizon?
- Cylon psychology's based on projection.
- Projection?
How they choose to see
the world around them.
The only difference
is you choose to see me.
What are you?
Really?
You're either connected to
the woman l knew on Caprica,
or a part of my subconscious struggling
for self-expression. So which one is it?
l'm an angel of God,
sent here to help you.
Just as l always have been.
We're all part of one big ecosystem.
Yes, l can feel it... breathing.
Get used to it.
- So, what'd he say?
- l haven't asked him yet.
Asked me about what?
Earth.
Uh... Wha?
Earth.
It's the thirteenth colony.
Do you know how to find it?
Not really, no.
That's unfortunate.
There was a hope - my hope -
that if you knew the way to Earth,
it would justify keeping you alive
a little longer. Come on, Six.
Wait. Wait! Wait!
Now, when l say
that l do not know exactly where Earth is,
that is not to say l do not know
a great deal about its probable location.
Honestly, l spent hours... Days. Weeks!
Months and months on a map
that Adama and Roslin found on Kobol.
l correlated that with our observations.
l doubt anyone can make the same claim.
We'll get back to you.
What do you care
about finding Earth?
Because we're looking for it.
You are?
Yes, we've decided that Earth's
going to be our new home.
<i>(Helo) Ship-to-ship training exercise</i>

Looks like it severed the fuel line.
Cally, check the tank.
God, this is ugly.
Tank's dry.
There's not even fumes in here.
- <i>(Chief)</i> Captain, how'd you land this?
- l pointed it at the deck and stopped.
Bone-dry, she says.
Landed the bird without a drop of fuel.
If you want to die,
l will open up an airlock for you,
but you are not
taking my Vipers with you.
The bird's on the deck. l'm on the deck.
What are you bitching about?
l don't give a frak what you do, Starbuck.
You're done flying.
<i>(woman) l can't believe</i>
<i>you did that to me.</i>
<i>(Tigh)</i> What?
- <i>(woman) Don't look at me like that!</i>
- Oh, my gods!
Ellen?
Ellen!
Excuse me!
Hey, make a hole!
Excuse me.
Ellen.
<i>(woman)</i> l've told you
a thousand times.
- Ellen, l'm right here.
- What is this? Let go of me.
Kara! Kara!
- Kacey?
- Kara, Kara!
l'm sorry, don't you remember me?
l'm Julia Brynn. l'm Kacey's mom.
- Yeah, l remember.
- <i>(Kacey)</i> Give me a hug.
We're staying in...
Everyone's calling it Camp Oil Slick -
part of the hangar deck.
They've put up cots for refugees.
- Yeah. Yeah, l heard.
- Kacey's been asking to see you for days.
l sent messages.
l thought maybe you'd come for a visit.
You seem like a nice person
so l'm gonna be honest with you.
The last thing l need is a two-year-old
friend, and she doesn't need me in her life,
so do us both a favour and do not
bring her around here again, OK?
Go to your mom, Kace.
Sure. Sorry.
Don't let us keep you up.
Sorry, honey. We gotta go.
<i>(Helo)</i> There it goes.
That's it. See?
See? l told you you could do it.
You did great.
Remind me never
to let that happen again.
You got it, slim.
Ever!
l've been trying to reassemble
President Bal...
Dr Baltar's work on piecing together
the thirteenth tribe's path to Earth.
What is it you trust about his research?
How do you know it's not another lie?
One thing l learned about Baltar
was his extraordinary capacity
for self-preservation.
l think he wanted to find Earth
because <i>he</i> wanted to get there.
How far did he get
with his research?
As you can see,
l'm still hacking through his notes,
but it appears that he was trying to
correlate our own astrometric readings
with the map of constellations
that we found back on Kobol
and applying his findings
to certain select passages
- within the scroll of Pythia.
- Why the scroll of Pythia?
Pythia's supposed to have chronicled
the journey of the thirteenth tribe to Earth.
If l can draw your attention to this, "The
caravan of the heavens was watched over
by a great lion
with a mighty blinking eye..."
- "Red and blue."
- <i>(Gaeta)</i> Exactly.
Exactly what?
We're looking for a lion's head?
- With a mighty blinking eye.
- Blinking!
The scrolls,
they speak in metaphors.
l thought the doctor might be off his meds
as well, sir, but then l found this note...
here, where he had written
"blinking equals pulsar".
That means a star, right?
Plural, actually.
They're the rotating cores of dead stars.
They emit a blast of radio waves.
From a distance, they appear to...
- Blink.
- Right.
The doctor found two in very close
mutual orbit within this sector.
The spectrographic readings l found
show one will appear to be red
and one will appear to be blue.
Now, these pulsars
appear to be in this nebula.
We have never had a look at this area,
but it is possible,
with a couple of eyeballs out there,
they might look at the nebula and see...
A giant lion's head.
Well, it looks like this is
the best thing we've got going, so...
Unless you object, Admiral,
l suggest we go lion hunting.
<i>(Number Six)</i> The navigational markers
you gave us may prove useful.
We sent a baseship out to investigate
the pulsars and look for this lion's head.
Look, this isn't easy for me.
l don't think you fully appreciate
just how difficult this is.
l have very conflicted, very ambiguous
feelings about helping you find Earth.
Funny how all that ambivalence
and conflict vanished
once you thought
your life hung in the balance.
You should know there's still scepticism
about whether you're being truthful.
Uh...
l'm very sorry.
We didn't mean to intrude.
Come on, Gaius.
<i>(Baltar)</i> Are we going round in circles?
It all looks the same to you. It'd be hard
for any human to navigate here,
especially without projecting.
You've used that word before. l'm not sure
what you're talking about. It helps you to...
What, exactly?
Have you ever daydreamed?
Imagined you were somewhere else?
l do have an active imagination.
Well, we don't have to imagine,
we project.
We choose to see our environment
in any form we wish, whenever we wish.
For instance, now, you see us as standing
in a hallway, but l see it as a forest.
Filled with trees, birds, sunlight.
Like the walks that you and l used to take.
On Caprica.
The aesthetic's what gives me pleasure,
not the specific memories.
Instead of blank walls, l surround myself
with a vision of God's creation.
Right, l think l understand projection,
but it's a bit of a coincidence, isn't it?
That l could see
such a vivid reality that l've created
and the Cylon projection experience
seems so similar.
Is it a coincidence?
Well, what are you saying?
There's a connection?
What? Because of
my experiences with you...
Am l a Cylon?
What was that?
Oh, nothing.
Just talking out loud.
Silly me.
Are you sure you want to go in second
seat again? l hear you're a pretty fair pilot.
Yeah, too many pilots, not enough birds.
Anything to keep me flying at this point.
If you want me, l'm yours, Boomer.
Uh, no. Boomer was...
She was someone else.
Listen up! We need a call sign
for Lieutenant Agathon.
- Chrome Dome!
- Titania.
- Wind-up Toy.
- Tin Can.
- Microchick.
- How about Athena?
- Digital...
- Wait, wait, wait. What was that?
You know,
the goddess of wisdom and war.
Usually accompanied by
the goddess of victory.
- <i>(man)</i> She likes it.
- Athena it is.
<i>(Kat)</i> Hey, Colonel!
Colonel, come have a seat.
Over here.
Enough of that to go around?
Always.
Dead Man's Chest - a cut-throat game.
Not usually your style.
It is now. And l'm in it to win.
If you don't like it, find another game.
There's some straight talk.
Have you seen the line-up
outside the head?
15 civilians standing in line, picking
their noses, waiting to take a shower.
- Frakking civilians think they run the ship.
- Beats what we had - it was like a tomb.
If you want to know what alone feels like,
spend a few weeks in a Cylon holding cell.
Yeah, it was a bitch on both sides.
It wasn't easy coming up with a plan
to save your sorry butts.
Yeah, you guys had it rough, huh?
Hot showers, three squares a day,
Viper jocks didn't even take a shot
till you jumped into orbit.
- We all made sacrifices.
- Is that so?
Yes, that's right.
While you were pinning wings
on your Cylon girlfriend,
our people were strapping
home-made bombs to their chests,
doing whatever they could
to take the bastards out.
So forgive me if l don't get all misty
over your sacrifices.
You seem distracted, Gaius.
Do I?
You can rest easy,
at least for now.
The data on Earth's location
and your valiant rescue of the baby
has gone a long way
toward impressing the others.
l used to think
you and l would have a baby one day.
There are 12 Cylon models. In the entire
occupation on New Caprica, l saw seven.
Now here, again, the same seven.
- Who are the final five?
- l can't talk about that.
- Can't or won't?
- l can't.
It's complicated,
but we don't talk about them. Ever.
But you'd know one of them, wouldn't
you? If they were to walk past here...
Six, we have a problem.
A baseship - the one we sent
to investigate the pulsars and Lion nebula.
We've lost contact.
The trouble is we know almost nothing
about the ship's status.
We received a garbled distress call,
then silence.
Unsurprisingly, their hybrid sent us
confusing data. Our hybrid is analysing it.
- What are the hybrids he's talking about?
- Be quiet, Gaius.
<i>(Number Eight)</i> Our hybrid's deciphered
part of the data we received.
<i>(Doral)</i> This is impossible.
<i>(Simon)</i> It may have been inevitable
once we took human form.
<i>(Doral)</i> We're not human.
We're not like him.
<i>(Simon)</i> God has chosen this time
to test us.
Whether we fail or pass the test
is up to us.
What's going on?
The missing baseship. It's been infected
with some kind of disease.
- Disease?
- Yes, it's killing them. All of them.
If an infected Cylon dies
and carries this into a resurrection ship,
it could rapidly spread,
potentially infecting our entire race.
Make sure the resurrection ship is
out of range then send in Centurions to...
No. The data indicates
that as soon as a hybrid was infected,
the Centurions started shutting down.
l assume our Raiders and baseships
are also susceptible.
Of course. We are all created
from the same genetic pool.
Then no Cylon can board that ship
without risk of infection.
Say you'll go aboard the infected baseship
and investigate what happened.
You sent them to that nebula,
remember?
Are you mad?
You have to prove to them
you can be counted on in an emergency.
- Show them you're worth keeping alive.
- What if l catch the disease?
What are the chances that a human
could catch something
that infects a Centurion or a Raider?
That is, if you're human.
And if you're really a Cylon -
one of the final five
you haven't seen yet -
then wouldn't you just rather
get it over with and die?
l'll go.
What?
Yes, l'll go.
Look, l am a trained scientist.
l can go to the baseship.
l can make observations
about their condition,
bring back information
about this disease.
If we land, the disease killing the human
Cylons could infect one of our Raiders.
Then don't send a Raider.
Surely the war's furbished you
with some Colonial vessels.
He's right. We could program one of
our Raptors to approach on autopilot.
- All right, then. Prepare to jump the ship.
- Make sure the resurrection ship stays.
A truly selfless act.
l could use a refill here.
<i>(Hotdog)</i> Here.
Here's to knowing that somebody
will always have your back.
The sentiment's good,
but, in my book,
trust is an overrated commodity.
Mm.
That one, l'll drink to.
- Frak you guys.
- What is your problem, Katraine?
My problem is you, Captain.
All this us-against-them crap.
- <i>(Starbuck)</i> Truth hurts. Give me another.
- Why don't you take it out on the Cylons?
- We busted our ass to get you back.
- You think that means anything?
Every Colonist that landed on
New Caprica was loyal, to a point.
It was amazing watching those people you
thought you knew go over to the Cylons.
- At least we knew where we stood.
- Is that so?
Then how come
you are off flight duty
and some Cylon lover
is holding down my post?
Don't kid yourselves. You're on your own
in life, each and every one of us.
Why don't you tell that to the pilots
that died getting you off that rock?
Gaeta's briefing Sharon and Racetrack
on the mission to the pulsars.
You mean Athena and Racetrack.
- Word travels fast.
- Yes, it does.
l understand that morale's taken a hit
on the flight deck.
Nothing we can't handle, sir.
l'm also told that Colonel Tigh is spending
a lot of time down the pilots' rec room.
Him and Starbuck. They've been holding
court, second-guessing the rescue,
bad-mouthing the crew
that stayed up.
If you weren't on the ground,
it's like you can't be trusted.
And people are listening?
Their word carries a lot of weight.
You're right. They're destroying morale
and unit cohesion.
- They both know better.
- l don't think they care, sir.

<i>(woman)</i> New paragraph. Pancreatic fluid

We're here to experience. Evolve the toe.
Reduction occurs stepwise,

Full stop. New paragraph.
Do you have any idea
what it's talking about?
No. Most Cylons think the conscious
mind of the hybrid has simply gone mad,
and the vocalisations we hear
are meaningless.
But not everyone thinks that.
The ones you know as Leoben
believe that every word out of her mouth
means something,
that God literally
speaks to us through her.
<i>(Baltar)</i> She sort of controls the ship,
does she?
<i>(Number Six)</i> She is the baseship
in a very real sense.
Mind gone mad.
She experiences life
very differently than we do, Gaius.
She swims in the heavens.
Laughs at stars,
breathes in cosmic dust.
Maybe Leoben's right.
Maybe she does see God.
We're wasting time.
Jump.
<i>(woman gasps for breath)</i>
There are bodies everywhere,
others dying.
What the hell is that?
Definitely man-made.
<i>(woman gasps for breath)</i>
You're severely dehydrated.
You must drink water.
Kill me.
There is no resurrection ship nearby.
You will not be downloaded
into a new body, you will just be gone.
l saw how they died.
Please.
Please, l can't bear that.
l'm here to bring help.
All right?
l'm just going to take some blood samples
for analysis on the baseship,
and then we will be able to
make a treatment for the disease.
You must breathe, please.
Please, take some water.
You're... you're from <i>Galactica.</i>
No, l'm from a baseship.
Tell me,
do you know what this is?
We found it floating
at these coordinates.
It must be some kind of...
beacon or marker.
It looks too old.
It looks very old.
Must have been left
by the thirteenth tribe.
Infected, poisoned,
left by some humans like you
to destroy us.
A human device,
filled with a pestilence.
- You sent us to this place.
- It wasn't me.
- You knew we'd bring it aboard.
- You don't know what you're saying.
This is the disease speaking through you.
Calm down.
- l am going to bring help.
- You knew it was here.
- You wanted other baseships to follow.
- l would never hurt you.
You wanted the other baseships
to know it was here.
- Be quiet.
- Suffer the same infection.
- Be quiet! l'm going to bring help.
- You want to destroy us all! You'll lie.
- Shut up!
- You'll lie to them. l know. It's your fault.
Shut up! Be quiet.
Shut up! Shut up.
Shut up!
<i>(Doral) Gaius, do you hear us?</i>
<i>Gaius, do you read?</i>
<i>Do you read? Are any of them alive?</i>
<i>What do you see? Speak to us.</i>
<i>What do you see? Are any of them alive?</i>
This is Gaius Baltar.
- l'm returning to the baseship.
- <i>(Doral) What do you see?</i>
l've seen nothing.
Nothing of consequence.
There's nothing left to do here.
Nobody likes it, but we have to make a
terrible choice. Do we attempt a rescue?
Risk the lives of our fleet,
even our species, or do we leave them?
- There's no cure in science.
- There has to be.
Look at them. They're so afraid. Even
the humans don't abandon their own.
- <i>(Leoben)</i> They must be sacrificed.
- <i>(Simon)</i> There is a question.
Yes, there is.
How did this happen?
<i>(Doral)</i> It's Baltar.
He led us there deliberately.
He's been working with <i>Galactica</i>
the whole time.
It wasn't me. Whatever you think l did,
l didn't do it, Honestly.
Baltar, we followed your coordinates,
found a disease with no treatment or cure.
If we leave, they're doomed,
never to return.
Perhaps God
would smile upon us for our mercy.
Listen to you.
You can barely even speak his name.
We have to agree. We are not
abandoning our brothers and sisters.
<i>(all speak at once)</i>
We have to leave them.
We have to jump and leave them
to their fate. There is no other way.
<i>(screams)</i>
<i>(screams echo)</i>
Mists of dreams drip along
the nascent echo and love no more.
End of line.
- The hybrid objects.
- She doesn't get a vote.
Jump the ship.
Jump.
This disease...
it must have come from someplace.
- So what did you notice on the ship?
- <i>(Baltar)</i> Nothing.
l am just as baffled as you are.
You noticed nothing suspicious
on the infected ship?
<i>(Baltar)</i> Nothing whatsoever.
<i>(man)</i> Admiral on deck.
<i>(Tigh)</i> Admiral.
Give me the room.
Stay in your seats.
<i>(Tigh)</i> Have a drink.
Give me your side arm.
What?
Your side arm.
<i>(Tigh)</i> Hey, there's a live round in that.
Now one of you -
l don't care who -
pick that weapon up
and shoot me.
- Admiral, l don't know...
- l didn't say to talk.
You've done enough of that already.
l said to pick up that weapon and shoot.
What's the matter?
No guts?
You don't got a pair?
- You're both frakking cowards.
- Watch your mouth.
Or what? You're going to turn
the rest of my pilots against each other?
Poison the crew?
You've already done that, Saul.
Both of you.
Yeah, well, if you're looking for
an apology, it isn't gonna happen.
You were like a daughter to me once.
No more.
You're a malcontent and a cancer,
and l won't have you on my ship.
So you have a choice.
You can figure out how to become
a human being again and an officer,
or you can find another place to live,
off of this ship.
You're dismissed.
Are you gonna kick me
out of my chair too?
- l know you've been through a lot.
- Don't patronise me.
Say what you came here to say.
You're full of bile, hatred,
and l know that has something to do with
Ellen. l'm sorry for that.
If you need time, Saul, you take all the
time you want. But l've got to run a ship.
The last thing l need
is a one-eyed drunk sitting down here,
sowing discontent and disobedience.
So l'll tell you once again, Saul,
you can pick up that weapon
and kill me,
or you can get your ass
back into your quarters and not leave
till you're ready to act like the man
that l've known for the past 30 years.
That man doesn't exist any more, Bill.
And you won't be seeing me again.
Oh, my gods!
It's right there.
The Lion's Head nebula
and the blinking eye!
Holy crap!
It's the road to Earth.
<i>(laughs)</i>
Oh, my gods!
Let's get the frak out of here.
l'll start the jump.
When God's anger awakens,
even the mighty shall fall.
Frak, Athena,
we need to get out of here!
- Blah-ba-bloo-ba...
- He's doing it again.
- Thanks.
- <i>(laughs)</i>
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>
Some people in the fleet
believe that the legend of Earth
held perhaps the greatest promise
for our survival.
- Do you know how to find it?
- Not really, no.
There was a hope - my hope -
that if you knew the way to Earth
it would justify
keeping you alive a little longer.
Now, when l say
that l do not know exactly where Earth is,
that is not to say l do not know
a great deal about its probable location.
<i>(Doral) A baseship -
<i>the one investigating pulsars</i>
<i>and the Lion nebula,</i>
<i>we've lost contact.</i>
<i>(Number Six)</i>
<i>The baseship, it's infected.</i>
If an infected Cylon dies and carries
this disease into a resurrection ship,
it could spread,
potentially infecting our entire race.
If one of us is resurrected...
the disease will follow.
Then no Cylon can board that ship
without risking infection.
l'll go. Yes, l'll go.
l can go to the baseship.
<i>l can make observations about Cylons,</i>
<i>their condition,</i>
<i>bring back information about this disease</i>
<i>which now threatens all of you.</i>
- <i>(Baltar) Do you know what this is?</i>
- It must be some kind of... beacon.
It must have been left here
by the thirteenth tribe.
The beacon carried the disease, left by
some humans like you to destroy us.
You noticed nothing suspicious
on the infected ship?
Nothing whatsoever.
l am just as baffled as you are.
Just like the scriptures say... There it is.
The Lion's Head nebula and blinking eye.
Holy crap! It's the road to Earth!
<i>(Apollo) This is combat.</i>
<i>Prepped and ready. Plan A.</i>
<i>We are approaching the baseship.</i>
<i>(Sharon)</i> This is so wrong.
What the hell happened here?
<i>(Sharon)</i> Whatever this is,
it's something new.
Go.
Apollo, <i>Galactica.</i> You are cleared hot.
<i>(Apollo) Roger that, "Galactica".</i>
We're in close now,
and by the look of it,
that ship's in no condition
to put up a fight.
Never seen anything like this.
Shall we proceed?
Hang on, guys.
<i>(Helo) Use extreme caution, Apollo.</i>
<i>(Apollo) Set perimeter.</i>
<i>Weapons tight, everyone.</i>
<i>Galactica,</i> Apollo. We're in.
<i>Galactica,</i> no sign of life.
<i>Ship appears</i>
<i>to be abandoned and powering down.</i>
What the hell?
<i>(coughing)</i>
<i>(Racetrack)</i> Gods, what happened?
<i>(Mathias)</i> l don't know, but their frakking
resurrection ship is gonna overheat.
<i>Galactica,</i> Apollo.
We've reached the control centre.
<i>30, maybe 40, dead skin-jobs.</i>
Mathias, set a perimeter!
Sharon. Athena!
See what you can pick up
with the computers.
Three fire teams, each doorway. Go.
OK, l'm gonna try
to call up the database.
If l get a connection,
put the SSR leads in the water.
Reduce the error-correction levels
for higher throughput.
- <i>(Racetrack)</i> You sure you wanna do that?
- It's how it works.
<i>(gasps)</i>
You OK?
Yeah, the data points
are almost completely corroded.
l don't know if l'm gonna
get much out of here, but let's try.
What is going on?
Frak me! This one's alive!
We've got a live one over here!
<i>(Mathias)</i> Cover the Major!
<i>(Apollo)</i> They're alive!
<i>Galactica,</i> Apollo. We got, uh...
one, two, three, four...
five living skin-jobs down here.
l say again, five... five living.
- <i>(Helo) Are you taking fire?</i>
- Negative. They seem in pretty bad shape.
Don't take chances.
If they make a move...
<i>Oh, you can trust me on that one.</i>
Major, what do we do?
Should we take 'em out?
<i>(Apollo)</i> Hold your fire, hold your fire!
- <i>(Mathias)</i> Keep away from the frakkers!
- l said, hold your fire!
<i>(Cylons moan)</i>
<i>(Cylons cough)</i>
<i>(Cylon)</i> Grant us strength...
<i>(Cylon</i> #2)...wisdom...
- <i>(Apollo)</i> What are they doing?
- <i>(Cylon #3)...and</i> above all...
Hey, Athena, what are you doing?
Athena!
What are you doing? Athena!
Traitor.
<i>(Number Six)</i> Save yourself.
From what?
Get away from us.
What happened here?
<i>(Number Six)</i> The beacon.
<i>(faltering)</i> We brought it... on board.
It carried a disease.
We're infected.
Infected?
- Son of a bitch!
- OK, OK, OK! Settle down!
Keep back!
Watch the doorways. Get the doorways!
<i>Galactica,</i> Apollo.
We have a situation down here.
The Cylons have been
infected with... a disease.
<i>We have all been exposed.</i>
<i>We've all been exposed.</i>
<i>(Cottle) They'll come aboard</i>
<i>under quarantine.</i>
Clear a path from the hangar
to sickbay, and sterilise it.
- And the Raptors, after they're in.
- l'll handle that.
- How long in quarantine?
- l won't know till the blood work.
Could be days, weeks.
There's no way to tell.
They picked up this disease
from a beacon?
According to the Cylons.
Good to have the source of the pathogen.
Can you bring it aboard <i>Galactica?</i>
No, too dangerous.
l want to limit our exposure.
- <i>(Cottle)</i> What about the prisoners?
- Prisoners?
The disease is advanced in their systems,
so it'll give me an idea
of what to expect as it progresses.
And when they die, it'll tell me
how long our people have to live.
- How many prisoners?
- How many you got?
<i>(Helo) Apollo, "Galactica". Alpha check.</i>
<i>Galactica,</i> we have you in visual range.
Approaching starboard hangar.
<i>(Helo) Apollo, what was that?</i>
<i>(Gaeta)</i> Massive energy discharge
from the baseship.
- It exploded, sir.
- Are you all right out there?
Uh, yeah, affirmative.
We're still here.
- <i>What the hell happened?</i>
- Baseship exploded. Self-destructed.
You're lucky you got out.
<i>Roger that.</i>
- <i>(Baltar)</i> Nothing the matter, l trust?
- We have some questions.
How long have you
planned to betray us, Gaius?
Funny.
- You're joking, of course.
- You're making this harder on yourself.
Wait a minute. l have been more than
very accommodating since l arrived here.
l helped you find Sharon's baby.
l've helped you with a map towards Earth.
We know about the beacon, Gaius.
You knew it was out there.
You knew it contained a deadly virus.
No, l didn't. l didn't.
Was the virus created by <i>Galactica?</i>
<i>(Number Three)</i> Have you been in contact
since you've been on board?
Or did you plan this
before the evacuation of New Caprica?
This is the
most profound misunderstanding.
Uh, l had nothing to do
with the virus or the beacon.
Yes.
Yes, l did discover it
on the baseship,
and l should have told you sooner,
and l didn't.
because l thought, you'd try and link me,
you know, to the virus,
which is, hello,
what's going on right now.
l was wrong. It was a mistake,
and l fully admit my responsibility.
It will never happen again.
And l hope you'll accept my most, uh,
yeah, my most humble apology.
On a brighter note, l have a working
theory as to where this beacon may...
<i>(clunking footsteps)</i>
l'm sorry, Gaius.
Things would have been so much simpler
had you only told the truth.
We think you know more about this virus,
and we intend to find out.
Relax. Have a drink.
l can't.
The pain. The pain.
It's all in your head, Gaius.
Pain, pleasure...
they're just neural impulses
sent to the brain.
You decide how to interpret them.
They can be pleasant...
or unpleasant.
<i>(high-pitched electronic whine)</i>
No!
No, please!
Please! No!
<i>(pitch lowers)</i>
- l want it to stop, Gaius.
- <i>(whining stops)</i>
l don't want you to feel this pain.
And neither does Caprica. Do you?
No.
l love you.
- You feel anything yet?
- Yeah, l feel sick. Sick of you buggin' me.
- <i>You</i> didn't touch any infected skin-jobs.
- It's not my fault you're clumsy.
- You can kiss my infected ass.
- You can kiss it, but it's not infected.
l got your blood work back. Humans are
immune to the virus. You're all healthy.
All right, people. Nice job.
Let's get outta here.
No. You stay put for a while.
Yeah!
No, no, no, no, no.
Please tell me she's OK.
- l haven't done her blood work yet.
- What?
Oh, l see.
She can wait because of who she isn't.
Sharon.
You're gonna be OK. l promise.
You come for me, godsdamn it.
You come for me the second you know.
Take him. He's the furthest gone.
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
- <i>(Roslin)</i> You can keep the Cylons alive?
- l can't cure them, but yes.
- How long?
- Indefinitely.
l identified the virus.
We know it as lymphocytic encephalitis.
The disease is carried by rats, mostly.
But a couple of hundred years ago,
humans developed an immunity.
Now l can create a simple vaccine
that will dramatically reverse
the effect of the virus on the Cylons.
But, uh, they have
an antibody in their blood
which breaks down
the RNA of the vaccine.
So they will need regular, close-interval
injections of the vaccine, or they will die.
Can l ask the ugly question here?
Is there a reason to keep them alive?
We could interrogate them
for intelligence.
l agree.
We have a lot of unanswered questions.
OK. But they're not gonna talk.
They might if we dangled the vaccine.
They don't know it's a stopgap, not a cure.
They prayed on the infected ship.
Karl's wife said it was something called
"The prayer to the cloud of unknowing",
whatever that is.
Anyway, the point is,
she said they only use it
when they're facing
a death that is final.
No possibility of downloading.
They're ready to die.
Maybe, but it doesn't mean one of them
won't jump at a second chance.
It infected everything -
baseship,
Centurions,
Raiders -
until we were finally abandoned...
by the other Cylon ships.
Why?
Why not just put you under quarantine
until they found a cure?
Fear... of spreading the disease.
They told us that there was a bioelectric
feedback component to the pathogen.
It corrupts how our brains
manage our immune systems.
<i>(chokes)</i>
If one of us dies...
and is resurrected,
the disease will follow,
infecting the resurrection ship
and... and the fleet.
Why were you in this area
in the first place?
We were sent.
We were sent here
to look for the Lion nebula.
Baltar...
said it would point the way to Earth.
- What did you just say?
- Baltar... Baltar's alive?
Baltar... is on our baseship.
He's helping us find Earth.
He's using our navigation charts,
along with our map of Kobol.
He's leading them to Earth.
We... want...
a new beginning.
Much like you.
l gave you i-information.
She said that there...
there was a cure.
Doc Cottle will be...
giving you the medicine.
- Take him back to the infirmary.
- <i>(man)</i> Yes, sir.
<i>(Apollo sniggers)</i>
What the hell's so funny?
l think l just thought of a way
to solve all of our problems...
to get rid of the Cylon threat
for once and for all.
We can wipe 'em out.
We can destroy the entire Cylon race.
We jump to an area
we know the Cylons use as a supply line -
NCD2539.
We stay there, exposed.
We look as if we're spoiling for a fight.
They'll send a fleet. Where there's a fleet,
there's a resurrection ship.
And once the resurrection ship
is within our reach,
we execute our infected prisoners.
We bug out. The prisoners download
into the ship, and with them, the virus.
You sure the virus
will download to a new body?
The Cylons are sure of it.
They left their wounded out here to die
alone, with no hope of being rescued.
Tells me all l need to know.
And once the virus is in the resurrection
ship... there will be no stopping it.
Rescuers become
carriers of the plague.
The Cylons themselves
don't believe that they'll develop a cure.
Oh, my gods.
- This could be the end of the Cylons.
- Forever.
Genocide?
So, that's what we're about now?
They're not human.
They were built, not born. No fathers,
no mothers, no sons, no daughters.
l had a daughter.
l held her in my arms.
And she was half-human.
These are things.
Dangerous things.
This is our one chance to be rid of them.
You can rationalise it any way you want.
We do this,
we wipe out their race,
then we're no different than they are.
<i>(Roslin)</i> Captain, l respectfully disagree.
The Cylons struck first in this war and, not
content with the annihilation of billions,
they pursued us relentlessly
through the galaxies to wipe us out.
They tried to live with us
on New Caprica.
- What did you say?
- They tried to live with us.
You weren't on New Caprica. To my
recollection, you didn't set foot there.
So out of respect
for the men and women
who suffered through that snake pit,
l'm gonna pretend l didn't hear that.
You would serve your fleet well
if you'd remember
that Cylons are a threat
to the survival of humans.
l'm talking about right and wrong.
l'm talking about
losing a piece of our souls.
But no one wants to hear that, right?
Let's keep it on me.
Yeah, l'm married to a Cylon...
who walked through hell for all of us
how many times?
And she's not half anything,
OK. How do we know there aren't
others like her? She made a choice.
She's a person.
They're a race of people.
Wiping them out with a biological weapon
is a crime against...
is a crime against humanity.
But they're not human.
They're programmed.
We will take your input
under advisement.
Thank you both.
Thank you, ma'am.
Dismissed.
<i>(electronic whine)</i>
<i>(pitch heightens)</i>
l can help you.
l can guide you through the torment,
but you'll have to do the work.
l'll do anything. Anything!
Then tell us what we want to know.
How was the virus invented?
Did they make a cure?
<i>(Number Six) Look at me. Look at me.</i>
When you make love to me, Gaius,
you don't always think about me.
Your mind wanders. l know that.
You think of equations,
puzzles, your laundry.
It's the nature of the mind
to disconnect from the body
and journey on its own.
Separate your mind from your body.
Keep your mind in that room.
Use your intellect against her.
Reason,
logic,
analysis.
Find the holes in her psyche.
l can't. Pain...
Pain's only in your body,
so keep your body here with me.
Don't worry. l'll take care of it.
<i>(whining slows)</i>
<i>(Number Three)</i> You see, Gaius,
this is what the absence of pain feels like.
It's easy to forget.
l had nothing to do with the virus.
It was a coincidence.
There's no such thing
as coincidence.
God wills the universe
according to his design.
<i>(Number Six)</i> Now, focus on her...
as a Cylon, not a woman.
Be a scientist.
Examine her faith.
What's your analysis, Doctor?
l'm a scientist.
And as a scientist,
l believe that if God exists
our knowledge of him is imperfect. Why?
The stories and myths
we have are the products of men,
the passage of time.
The religion you practise is based
on a theory, impossible to prove,
yet you bestow it with absolutes like,
"There is no such thing as coincidence."
It's called faith.
Absolute belief in God's will
means there's a reason for everything.
Everything!
And yet...
you can't help but ask yourself how
God can allow death and destruction,
and then despise yourself for asking.
But the truth is, if we knew God's will,
we'd all be gods, wouldn't we?
l can see it in your eyes, D'Anna.
You're frustrated.
You're conflicted.
Let me help you.
Let me help you change.
Find a way
to reconcile your faith with fact.
Find a way
towards a rational universe.
l don't know what your game is,
but it's not going to work.
You intentionally led one
of our ships to that beacon, didn't you?
Give your body to me.
Only your mind is there.
Feel me. Feel this
where she wants you to feel pain.
Look at me. Look at me, Gaius.
Do you want me to believe
you're worth saving?
Do you?
Do you? Say it.
l want you to believe in me.
Don't stop! Don't stop!
Please, please, don't stop.
You have to believe in me.
You're all l have left.
<i>(moans)</i>
Now tell me you believe in me.
Tell me you believe in my strength.
l believe in you!
l believe in you.
l love you.
l love you with all my heart.
l love you with all my heart.
How?
Cottle said it had something to do
with carrying a half-human child.
How the foetal cells
enter the maternal circulatory system,
causing the mother to create antibodies.
Whatever. l'm immune!
Oh, my gods.
Our baby... saved my life.
She's gone forever,
and she saved my life.
Hera kept us together.
- To share this.
- This?
You mean us?
Together? You mean us?
Them. Them.
l mean them.
Who's "them?"
They're gonna execute
the infected prisoners.
But not until we jump into a Cylon region
with a resurrection ship present.
The infection's
gonna spread everywhere.
- There's a point l'd like to make.
- Mm-hm?
The law forbids me
to use biological weapons
without a presidential order.
Which means
you're passing the buck.
On this one, yes.
Helo's right on one thing.
We start destroying entire races,
even mechanical races,
we're liable to tear off
a piece of man's soul.
The Cylons are coming to Earth.
If they find us,
they are coming for us.
Those are the stakes.
They always have been, Bill.
We're talking about
the genocide of your entire race.
Yeah.
You think l don't know that?
l made a choice...
to wear a uniform,
to be a person.
You were a person
before you put on that uniform.
OK? You were a person
before l fell in love with you.
- You don't have to prove that.
- l have to prove it every day.
Let me tell you something, Helo.
My people may die.
My entire race may be wiped out.
But this Cylon will keep her word,
even if it means
she's the last Cylon left in the universe.
Can a human being do that?
Posterity really
doesn't look too kindly on genocide.
<i>(Roslin)</i> You're assuming
that posterity will define this as genocide.
If they do, at least there'll be
someone alive to hate us for it.
The Cylons are our mistake,
we created them.
All right, Admiral. As president, l have
determined the Cylons be made extinct.
The use of biological weapons
is authorised.
So say we all.
So say we all.
Jump complete.
DRADIS is clear. No Cylons, sir.
They'll be here soon enough.
Get our birds in the air.
Commence Viper
and nav Raptor launch.
Let's do this, Racetrack.
<i>(shouting)</i>
Move 'em back. Go.
Move, move. Come on.
CAP is away.
Nav bird has them on DRADIS.
DRADIS contact. A pair of Cylon Raiders.
Keeping their distance for now.
Didn't take 'em that long.
They're just scouts.
They'll jump away
and report back to their fleet.
Let's see if they take our bait.
Got it.
There's a resurrection ship with them.
<i>(Adama)</i> Then it's time
to execute our Cylon prisoners.
Call it in.
Terminate the prisoners.
- Head shots, OK?
- Yes, sir.
Let's do it.
All right, let's see if we can't frak up
some toasters on this joy ride, people.
<i>(Hotdog) l'm notching like hell!</i>
Hotdog, Starbuck. Quit your bitchin'
and continue to cover as fragged.
Out of the way.
Frak! They're already dead.
They're... they're already dead.
Sir, you should hear this.
<i>(Apollo) They were dead</i>
<i>before the ship was in range.</i>
<i>They didn't download the disease.</i>
<i>We've missed our window.</i>
<i>(Starbuck) A baseship just jumped in.</i>
Call our birds in.
Spool up. Let's get the hell outta here.
Commence FTL.
Sir, we lost time. We're gonna take
significant fire while we spool up.
Continue jump.
Take us back to our fleet.
Yes, sir.
They'll be coming for me.
You or me.
Seems like they're
always coming for one of us...
l'm not a traitor.
l love my people.
l love this ship.
Besides you, the first thing l wanna see
on any morning are the lights in that CIC.
l did what l thought was right.
If it was a mistake, fine.
l can live with that.
It's you l can't live without.
l'll always love you, Helo.
Mm. No, thanks.
The prisoners died of asphyxiation.
The air-purification system was reversed.
It sucked the oxygen out.
When this happens, the deadbolts
are automatically activated on the door.
- Someone did this manually.
- Someone?
Seems to me
there's only one or two likely suspects.
- Who will head the investigation?
- No one. l'm closing the book on this.
How convenient.
Cottle's report on the virus.
He thinks that it was simply
an accidental contamination
of the beacon we abandoned
on the sick baseship.
Somebody sneezed, maybe.
Yeah, an entire race
almost wiped out
because someone
forgot to wipe their nose.
According to Cottle,
the virus was an exact match
to one reported
over 3,000 years ago.
Right around the time
that the thirteenth colony left Kobol.
That beacon...
was a signpost to Earth.
l think we're on the right trail, Laura.
Yes, we are on the right trail, Bill.
So are the Cylons.
New scenery.
Whoa. Argh!
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>
You cannot play God then wash your
hands of the things that you've created.
Sooner or later,
the day comes when you can't hide from
the things that you've done any more.
Attention, all Colonial units.
Cylon attack underway.
- <i>This is no drill.</i>
- l'll be right there.
"How", "why" doesn't really matter now.
What does matter is that,
as of this moment, we are at war.
You're full of bile, hatred... poison.
And l'm sorry for what happened to you
down there, but l've gotta run a ship.
The last thing l need is a one-eyed drunk
sowing discontent and disobedience.
You can get your ass
back to your quarters
and not leave till you're ready to act like
the man l've known for the past 30 years.
That man doesn't exist any more, Bill.
You won't be seeing me again.
<i>(heartbeat/heavy breathing)</i>
Is there really any place left
in the universe
deserving of such a rare
and distinguished item?
l was thinking of putting it
in the bathroom right over the toilet.
Excellent choice.
<i>(gasps)</i> Oh, my gods.
Oh, Tory, come look at this. This is
the dossier that Billy prepared for me
my first day aboard <i>Galactica.</i>
l can't believe l was about
to throw this out in the trash.
<i>(Tory)</i> The <i>Valkyrie.</i> This was Adama's
command before <i>Galactica?</i>
- Mm-hm.
- Look at that.
This year marks Admiral Adama's
45th anniversary in the Colonial fleet.
In fact, his commissioning date's
only a few days from now.
Here.
l think l want to have a ceremony.
Let's give the admiral a medal...
- for 45 years of devoted service.
- Couldn't have come at a better time.
Give the people something
to feel good about for a change.
<i>(alarm)</i>
<i>(Helo)</i>
<i>Set condition one throughout the ship.</i>
l repeat, set condition one
throughout the ship. This is not a drill.
- What's the problem?
- Three Raiders.
CBDR, bearing 145, carom 33.
- This isn't standard wedge formation.
- Where's the CAP?
Starbuck and Kat intercept in 98 seconds.
Looks like a pursuit. Weapons exchanged.
- Pursuit?
- Yes, sir.
We've got two Raiders... chasing a third.
- Have they fired on any of ours yet?
- No, sir.
What the hell are they doing?
Let's see if we can climb up their asses
without drawing fire.
They seem preoccupied
with the other one.
Any idea why Cylons
would be chasing Cylons?
Don't know, don't care.
Wait till we close. l don't wanna
chase them longer than l have to.
Yeah, roger that.
- <i>(Kat) Two down, one to go!</i>
- <i>(Starbuck) Kat, check six.</i>
<i>Damn. Kat, flank right.</i>
<i>This guy's heading for "Galactica".</i>
<i>l'm on it, Starbuck!</i>
<i>(man) Krypter! Krypter! Krypter!</i>
<i>This is Bulldog.</i>
<i>Get me the hell out of here. l'm wounded.</i>
<i>- (Starbuck) Who the frak is that?</i>
<i>- (Kat) Target in range. Closing in.</i>
- <i>This is Bulldog.</i>
- <i>(Kelly)</i> Audio lock-on enabled.
- Where is that coming from?
- It's the Raider, sir.
- <i>(Starbuck) Take the frakking shot, Kat.</i>
- <i>(Kat) Give me one sec.</i>
<i>Krypter! Krypter! This is Bulldog.</i>
<i>(Starbuck) Kat, take the frakking shot!</i>
Order the Vipers
to hold their fire immediately.
Have them escort the Raider in.
Prisoner drill. l want the alert guard
in the hangar deck in five minutes.
Yes, sir.
Park that bird. Let's grab this Raider.
Let's go, people. Move with a purpose.
Make some room for the marines.
Is it really you, sir?
Yeah.
It's me.
Welcome home, Bulldog.
We may never have
this opportunity again.
l'm assuming you appreciate
the consequences if you're discovered.
And you understand, Commander,
that this conversation did not happen.
Are you prepared for this?
Of course, sir.
On one condition - l need my men,
especially for the stealth ship.
- There's only one pilot l trust.
- Who?
Well, the conspiracy theorists
are gonna be disappointed.
l checked your DNA signature against
your military records and it's conclusive.
You're not a Cylon.
Smoke?
That's right. He's one of mine.
<i>Disappeared about three years ago.</i>
<i>We think that he was captured.</i>
- l'd like to meet him.
- <i>Of course. l'll arrange it.</i>
He checks out fine.
Whatever they did to him out there,
they kept him fed and relatively healthy.
Physically, anyway.
l know you've been through a lot.
l realise that.
But you've got to talk to me, Danny.
How the hell did you escape
off a Cylon baseship?
Well, sir. It's like this...
The enemy had me
locked in a cell for three years.
The accommodations were lousy,
the service was slow,
and, after a while, l felt the institution
no longer had anything to offer me.
So l left.
You had me worried there for a moment.
l thought maybe the Cylons had beaten
the bullshit attitude out of you.
How did you get out?
l thought l was gonna die in there, Bill.
But a while ago,
they all started getting sick.
l <i>mean... really</i> sick.
- You mean a virus?
- Yeah.
We've seen that too.
l heard them say it was spreading,
getting worse.
But eventually l realise...
l'm not catching it.
- l'm immune.
- So what did you do?
l was smart... patient. l waited.
<i>(metallic clanging)</i>
<i>(Number Three)</i> Well, well.
You're looking good.
<i>Strong. (chuckles)</i>
Me, l've felt better.
l don't know why you guys
do all that exercising.
What, are you trying
to stave off getting old?
Doesn't seem such a tragedy to me,
given the alternatives.
<i>(bars clang)</i>
Know what l'm saying?
Do l look that bad?
You know what l think?
l think you're afraid.
<i>(bars clang)</i>
Argh!
Let me try and understand exactly what
happened. l'm just gonna go back a little.
About a year prior
to the Cylon attack on the Colonies,
you were on a mission
with Admiral Adama. Is that correct?
It was a... a black ops mission.
You remember the Tauron Colonists
were such outlaws,
always... pushing their luck
with the admiralty every chance they got?
<i>(Roslin)</i> Right.
The Taurons were drilling for tylium ore
on a moon that was too close
to the Cylon armistice line.
We knew that they had to get out of there
or risk provoking the Cylons.
l'm sorry, but how did this result
in his ship being shot down?
He was my recon pilot.
He was there to gather evidence.
The Taurons must've seen us coming
because they ambushed him.
Lieutenant Novacek was shot down
by the Taurons in cold blood.
<i>(Bulldog) Krypter!</i>
<i>l've got damage to the port engine.</i>
<i>Bird is down.</i>
<i>Repeat, bird is down. Request rescue!</i>
<i>Krypter! Krypter! Krypter! This is Bulldog.</i>
<i>Bird is down.</i>
<i>Repeat, bird is down. Request rescue!</i>
So what did you do?
l made a bad call.
His ship was gone.
No ejection on DRADIS, no distress call.
He was dead.
So l left.
But the lieutenant did eject, obviously,
and somehow survived in his ejection seat
long enough for the Cylons to find him.
Wow.
Could you both give us a moment?
Thank you, Tory.
And thank you very much, Lieutenant.
Madam President.
Why don't we check the fleet registry, see
if any of your family might have survived?
So are you gonna tell me
what really happened?
You're gonna have to trust me
on this one, OK?
It's my mess.
l'll fix it.
This is the last one.
Fire.
<i>(Tigh)</i> l see it.
l see it.
- l see it.
- <i>(door opens)</i>
l see it.
Daniel Novacek just escaped
from a POW cell on a Cylon baseship.
Stole a Raider, flew it here.
l just finished debriefing him.
- Bulldog's alive?
- Yeah.
My gods.
How could he be alive?
That tough son of a bitch.
He actually made it, didn't he?
Yeah, l guess he did.
So, are you here to talk to your friend
or to your XO?
Last time l checked, l was neither.
Oh, l get it.
Oh, yeah.
This is gonna be a little complicated
for you, isn't it, Admiral?
- Are you gonna tell him what you did?
- l did what l had to do.
So tell him.
It won't make any difference.
The past is the past.
- You're equivocating.
- l don't know why the frak l came here.
Tell him. He's gonna find out...
sooner or later.
l see it.
<i>(banging on door)</i>
Go away.
<i>(banging on door)</i>
Godsdamn son of a bitch.
l can't believe it. It's really you.
Danny Novacek. l heard you'd made it.
Good for you, Bulldog.
Saul.
- Drink?
- You have no idea.
Yes, l do.
Dad?
- Hey, l just got your message.
- Thank you for coming. Sit down.
It's time for us to talk.
Let me ask you something.
How often do you get out of here?
All the time.
Been a little under the weather,
that's all.
How did you wind up on this old bucket,
anyway? What happened to the <i>Valkyrie?</i>
Well, let's just say...
that last mission wasn't exactly a boon
to the old man's career.
<i>Galactica</i> was his graceful retirement.
Heard you and the old man
haven't spoken in a while.
What's wrong? He won't cover your ass
day and night like he used to?
Oh, no.
He still does his share of ass covering.
Problem is, it's his main function now.
Of course, considering how you wound up
getting captured in the first place,
l guess you found that out the hard way
yourself, didn't you?
What's that supposed to mean?
My gods.
He didn't tell you, did he?
- Did he?
- Tell me what?
That son of a bitch.
l shot him down.
Well, uh, if you shot him down, you had
your reasons. You were following orders.
Preventing something worse, right?
No.
l shot him down to avoid...
detection.
Protect the mission... so it wouldn't be
discovered by the Cylons.
It was a black ops mission.
Its sole purpose was to ascertain
the likelihood of a Cylon strike.
Cy-Cylon strike?
So, you're saying that...
that we knew they were out there?
That they could launch
an attack on the Colonies?
We didn't know anything for sure.
There were theories in some circles
that the reason that the Cylons
had stayed dormant for so long
was because they were building
a war machine,
preparing a strike.
But l thought... l thought no one had seen
or heard from the Cylons in over 40 years.
That's true... partially.
The admiralty had grown restless
with the Adar administration.
<i>They felt we were resting on our laurels,</i>
<i>unprepared to protect against an attack.</i>
My mission was to escort a stealth
recon ship just beyond the armistice line.
Stick our nose over, gather evidence,
and... see if there was
any suspicious activities.
And if the Cylons discovered you
across the line,
breaching the armistice,
then they would see that as...
An act of war.
<i>(man) Stealth-Star, Valkyrie.</i> We register
you on DRADIS past the armistice line.
<i>You're on full alert. Proceed with caution.</i>
<i>Valkyrie,</i> Bulldog.
l'm exactly two clicks past the line.
Repeat, two clicks.
And l've got negative DRADIS contact.
Sir, there's nothing here, sir.
Which is fine by me.
Company wants to pay me for a joyride,
they came to the right driver.
Hell of a moon.
<i>(man)</i> DRADIS contact.
Unknown vessel jumped in.
Frak!
Krypter! Krypter!
l've got damage to the port engine.
Bird is down.
Repeat, bird is down. Request rescue!
- <i>Krypter! Krypter! This is Bulldog.</i>
- <i>(man)</i> Vessel just jumped out, sir.
<i>Bird is down. Request rescue!</i>
<i>Krypter! Krypter! Krypter! This is Bulldog.</i>
<i>Bird is down. Repeat, bird is down.</i>
<i>(man)</i> Two more DRADIS contacts. Sir,
please instruct. What are your orders, sir?
- Sir, what are your orders?
- <i>(Tigh)</i> Don't do this.
Think about it, Bill.
You don't wanna do this.
Do you want his ship discovered?
Do you know where we are?
Do you have any idea
what this could mean?
<i>(man)</i> Bogeys on intercept course. Will
merge with <i>Stealth-Star</i> in 20 seconds.
- Sir!
- Weapons.
Launch ship-to-ship missile... now.
<i>(alarm)</i>
- <i>(console beeps rapidly)</i>
- No!
- There is no way.
- It's true. And you know it's true.
You've known it every second
of every day since it happened.
The sooner you admit it, the sooner you
get that haunted look out of your eyes.
Listen to me.
Sometimes surviving
can be its own death sentence.
l know that.
So the attack on Novacek's ship,
the one that winged him,
and the two DRADIS contacts that were
following him, they weren't Taurons.
Those were the Cylons.
All those years l told myself
that l didn't know what they were.
l was just lying to myself,
pretending that it couldn't be true.
It is true.
l started it...
initiated it.
Wait a minute. Started what?
- Started what?
- The attacks on the Colonies.
By crossing the line,
l showed them that we were
the warmongers they figured us to be.
And I...
l left them but one choice.
To attack us...
before we attacked them.
No. No.
Because it wasn't just you.
They put you there. They put you there,
across the line. You had no choice.
That was the admiralty.
That was the... that was the military.
You were one mission.
You were one man.
One man.
It only takes one.
- <i>(Number Six)</i> You all right?
- Yeah, of course.
- More nightmares?
- Dreams.
Something different this time, though.
l think God's trying to tell me something.
- It's about Gaius, isn't it?
- No.
It's not.
It's about something
much bigger than that.
After you execute this command,
you'll delete the order from your logs,
then overwrite
the corresponding memory locations.
Execute.
<i>(gunshot)</i>
It's OK. It's OK.
Relax. Try to breathe through it.
- Breathe.
- <i>(gasps)</i>
<i>(whispers)</i> There's something beautiful -
miraculous - between life and death.
Huh.
That's weird.
Why the hell do they keep missing?
Frak.
<i>(phone buzzes)</i>
- Adama.
- <i>(Dualla) A call from Lieutenant Novacek.</i>
- Put him through.
- <i>Bill.</i>
- Yes?
- <i>This is Danny. We need to talk.</i>
- Hold on.
- <i>l need to see you right now.</i>
Hold on, l'll be right there.
The Cylons are saddled up on him.
They've got a perfect
point-blank, no-deflection shot.
- They had him dead to rights.
- l'd say so.
Look, Novacek was hit and smoking,
flying straight and level.
Any nugget could've made that kill.
The Cylons could've wasted him
any number of times, and they didn't.
They didn't. They let him escape.
Cylons don't do anything by accident.
Yeah, that's what l was thinking, too.
Did Novacek say how he was able
to overcome the Cylons that held him?
They were sick, had a virus.
How many viruses
do the Cylons have, sir?
Who knows? Maybe it was the same virus
those Cylons we found were suffering...
Yeah, or maybe they just told us
a story we'd buy.
Something that was credible, familiar.
<i>Novacek was held prisoner</i>
<i>on a baseship for three years,</i>
<i>escapes,</i>
<i>and then conveniently finds our fleet,</i>
<i>with no agenda and no reason to be here.</i>
Hey, Dan.
It's funny how
all the training comes back, huh?
Why did you lie to me, Bill?
All those years...
You know what l kept telling myself?
What stupid frakked-up dream
l held on to?
l kept thinking,
"Just hang in there, Bulldog."
"Bill Adama's coming. He won't leave you
to rot in here, not him."
"He won't leave a man behind.
Just hold on."
But you weren't coming.
You didn't think l was alive.
You weren't even hoping
l was alive!
And if l hadn't figured a way to escape,
if l didn't make my move
when l saw they'd left that door
wide open for me,
l'd be as good as dead right now!
Is that what they did?
Did they leave the door open?
Did they let you escape?
<i>(Bulldog) That's not what l meant.</i>
<i>l know the truth!</i>
l beat them. Do you understand?
l beat them at their own game.
l frakkin' killed her, and l escaped.
You trying to take that away from me?
Bulldog! <i>(cocks gun)</i>
Stay down!
- Are you all right, Bill?
- Yeah, l'm OK.
You don't wanna believe it, do you?
l know. The truth hurts, Bulldog.
But it's better to know the truth
than to live a lie.
We're all soldiers, Danny.
We're all expendable.
And we did what we had to do
to protect the mission.
It's ugly, but there it is. The Cylons
let you go. The question is, why?
Ask yourself that, Danny.
Because up until a minute ago, you were
doing exactly what they wanted you to:
come here and learn the truth,
and seek revenge.
And that's exactly what you did.
You almost gave them what they wanted.
Tell you a dirty little secret - the toughest
part of getting played is losing dignity...
feeling like you are not worth
the oxygen you are sucking down.
You get used to it.
You start to believe it.
You start to love it.
It's like a bottle that never runs dry.
You can keep reaching for it
over and over and over again.
So, how do you put that bottle away,
Saul?
l don't know.
One day, you just decide to...
get up and walk out of your room.
<i>(Roslin)</i> What is this?
Your resignation.
You've got to be kidding me.
l've said before,
we can't hide from the things we've done.
l see no other way around this situation.
- Maybe it's time, Laura.
- Sit down, Bill.
l think you're being naive.
Naive?
Did it ever occur to you
that the admiralty may have set you up
to provoke a war they wanted?
It's naive to think horrible things we can't
understand have simple explanations.
Because simple explanations make us
feel like we have control when we don't.
We know why the Cylons attacked us
and it wasn't any one thing. Oh, my gods.
We did a thousand things,
good and bad, every day for 40 years,
to pave the way for those attacks.
Something has to be done.
You know what that is?
Medal of Distinction.
This is before l heard about
this resignation of yours. So, hm...
l'd like to propose this:
you seem hellbent on paying penance
for whatever it is you think you've done,
so instead of resigning,
why don't you walk out of here,
meet me on the port hangar deck
tomorrow for this ceremony,
and let me pin
a frakkin' medal to your chest?
- l can't.
- It's not for you.
It's for them.
Stand up there, acknowledge your fleet,
and give them what they need -
a hero.
That'll be your penance,
even if it kills you.
On behalf of everyone here, it is my
pleasure to present you, Admiral Adama,
with the Medal of Distinction for 45 years'
courageous service to the Colonial fleet.
Congratulations.
<i>(man)</i> All right, sir!
Have Dr Stoffa call me
as soon as you arrive.
And, Bulldog, you're gonna be fine.
Just remember
it'll take some time, all right?
Lieutenant.
You forgot something.
- l can't. Bill, I...
- Take it.
You're not getting off that easy.
Once a pilot, always a pilot, Bulldog.
Yes, sir.
<i>(knock on door)</i>
Come in.
l heard you won a medal.
Yeah.
They give them out
for anything these days.
Good behaviour...
attendance,
playing well with others.
l need you back in the CIC.
It just ain't the same without you in there,
intimidating the inmates.
No, no.
That's not what l came here
to talk to you about.
OK.
- So why are you here?
- l don't know. Nothing.
You wanna tell me
what happened to Ellen?
<i>(sighs)</i>
l could use a drink.
Me too.
Back masking.
It's turning me on, Dead Man.
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>
- l feel like l'm abandoning my post.
- Time to pack it in, Saul. You know it.
More than half the crew's
down on New Caprica already.
l'm not really doing too much
up here any more. Good luck.
Oh, my gods!
It's a Cylon fleet. They found us.
There's only one way
that this mission ends,
and that's with the successful rescue
of our people off of New Caprica.
- You brought them home, Saul.
- Not all of them.
- What about us?
- There is no "us". There is nothing here.
Do you get that? Nothing!
Lee, when are you gonna
get yourself a girl?
- l'm doing fine, thank you.
- You're not still frakking Dualla, are you?
l am proud to serve with you, Lieutenant.
And to call you my wife.
l'm in a different place now.
l just wanna hurt someone,
and it might as well be you.
<i>(bell rings/horn blares)</i>
<i>(shouting)</i>
- Come on!
- <i>(man)</i> Come on, Helo!
<i>(cheering)</i>
That was exactly what l needed.
Glad to be of service.
<i>(cheering)</i>
- Dammit.
- Looking for this?
Yeah.
Kara, l want you back.
l want our marriage back.
l want a real marriage.
And what if l'm just not ready for that?
l don't know.
Then l guess it'll never be.
Maybe cos l'm not what
you really want after all.
l'm late for the dance.
<i>(distant cheering)</i>
Don't forget your boots
on the way out, Sammy.
<i>(Kat)</i> Get that right up, Lee!
Come on!
<i>(bell rings/horn blares)</i>
- If it isn't the fighting Agathons, huh?
- Starbuck. Late to the party as usual.
At least l got here in time
to see you kick the CAG's ass.
<i>(Kat)</i> Lee, you've got him.
You've just gotta keep your right up.
He's a tough little frakker.
He's fighting me like he's got it in for me.
- <i>(Sharon)</i> Stay off the ropes.
- <i>(Kat)</i> Stick and move. Stay off the ropes.
- All right? You got him.
- <i>(bell/horn)</i>
<i>(Kat)</i> Come on, Lee!
Kick his ass!
You got him! You got him!
Come on!
<i>(man)</i> Helo! Come on, man!
<i>(Kat)</i> Keep moving! Yeah!
A few months ago,
you would've had to roll him into this ring.
Well, not any more. With a cooler head,
he might have half a chance.
- Come on!
- You've got him, come on!
<i>(Tigh)</i> Two.
Three.
Four.
- Come on.
- Five.
Six.
Seven. Hey, hey. Wait.
<i>(bell/horn)</i>
You did it, baby!
Fischer! Fischer, you're up!
Good fight.
Bit off a little more
than you can chew, huh?
Come on, Lee. Don't be that way.
Stick around. The night's young.
Well, l guess you'll just have to
enjoy it without me.
Pulling your tags out so soon?
l'm done, Kara.
l'm not.
Now who's biting off
more than they can chew, Captain?
Not me from where l'm standing, Major.
Excuse me.
l can't believe the progress they've made.
You should've seen it a month ago.
l'd still rather sleep in a warm bunk every
night than muck around in... in this muck.
Bunk's gonna be plenty warm tonight.
- He said yes.
- He approved the transfer?
<i>(Starbuck)</i> You two just don't know
when to keep a secret.
So, are you guys here
to see Baltar put a shovel in the ground?
"Join the celebration as we
break ground for a better tomorrow."
- Aw, it's such a load of crap.
- There's an open bar.
Really?
See, now why didn't you say so?
Lee, you've gotta let your better half
do the talking. She gets right to the point.
Let's go find us a "better tomorrow".
Excuse us.
Didn't expect to find you
playing in the sand.
It's not sand.
It's alluvial deposits.
This used to be the river mouth.
And you just had to take off your shoes
and play in the alluvial deposits.
How romantic.
- That's a nice colour on you.
- Thank you.
It's good to see you, Laura.
You too, Bill.
- There you are.
- Hey. How are you?
My father was an avid fight fan.
l adored my father, so l love a good fight.
l heard about your so-called "dance".
Accidentally, l might add.
Don't take it personally.
It's sort of a... private tradition.
Tradition?
<i>(Adama)</i> There's a lot of frustration
aboard warships.
Arguments become grudges,
then end up being feuds.
This allows them to let off some steam out
in the open so everybody can participate.
Rank doesn't matter. As long as you throw
your tags in the box, everyone's fair game.
<i>(bell/horn)</i>
- <i>(man)</i> Come on!
- Next up is Hotdog!
Hotdog, get your butt up here
and pick a partner.
- Did you throw your tags in there?
- <i>(laughs)</i>
No. No. l wish.
All the frustrations that l have...
- <i>(Tigh)</i> Who's your partner, Hotdog?
- Yeah!
Starbuck.
You've gotta be kidding me.
<i>(woman)</i> Starbuck!
<i>(bell/horn)</i>
Go, Starbuck. He's yours.
<i>(woman)</i> Get him, Starbuck!
<i>(bell/horn)</i>
<i>(man)</i> Come on, let's hear it!
Way to go, Starbuck!
<i>(applause)</i>
<i>(Baltar)</i> Thank you.
Let this day be remembered as the day
we broke ground for our new tomorrow.
<i>(laughs)</i>
But no, it gets better, OK?
Cos then they come back to the locker
room with handcuffs and two straws!
<i>(cheering)</i>
Did l ever tell you
how glad l am l married you?
- Not once.
- Oh.
Well, then l'll save it
for a special occasion.
Come here.
Come on!
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, baby.
<i>Hi. (giggles)</i>
We'll have the infrastructure
to deal with any unforeseen...
Excuse me. The finance minister
just came by and l should...
- Go ahead.
- Thank you, sir.
<i>(laughs)</i>
Oh, my gods.
l didn't think he'd ever leave.
He's a good kid.
Indeed.
- You say this stuff grows around here?
- Mm-hm.
In the mountains north of here there's this
little stream that comes down into a lake.
The water is so clear
it's like looking through glass.
l'm thinking of building a cabin.
It's good.
It is good.
That's a beautiful combination.
- What did l miss?
- Figurski, you done that bird already?
No, the gyro's giving me trouble. Come
on, Chief. l'm the only one over there.
Frak it.
Frak it, get yourself a drink.
- Ship down, Chief?
- Yeah, we'll get it tomorrow.
Figured l'd give him a little R and R.
Yeah!
Congratulations. l may be jumping
the gun, but first boy born on <i>Galactica.</i>
That's the thing
l want to talk to you about, sir. Um...
Cally doesn't want him born here.
And neither do I. Not if he has a chance
to grow up breathing fresh air.
What are you saying?
Thank you. We both would like
to request to be relieved of duty
and settle on New Caprica.
No. No way.
Look, you're both here for the duration.
<i>(bell/horn)</i>
- What?
- Can you hold these? Thank you.
<i>(shouting dies down)</i>
<i>(man)</i> Yeah!
- Chief...
<i>- (crowd mutters)</i>
- Get your fat, lazy ass up here.
- <i>(crowd cheers)</i>
Helo.
- Make them tight.
- Yes, sir.
He's an old man. l'll be fine.
He's not serious, anyways.
It's all on the admiral.
Sure about this?
It's your funeral.
<i>(man)</i> Do it, buddy.
<i>(bell/horn)</i>
<i>(crowd gasps)</i>
- <i>(man)</i> Did you see that?
- Oh!
Get up, Chief.
We're just getting started.
You know, l was thinking it's probably
better to have the baby on the <i>Galactica.</i>
You know, there's sickbay,
doctors, medicine.
Yeah. No, it'll be better.
We'll be happier.
Yeah.
Come on, Admiral!
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, baby.
<i>Hi. (giggles)</i>
Is this really it, Bill?
Is this how we're gonna spend
all the rest of our days?
Hm?
<i>(#jig)</i>
Maybe we should just enjoy this.
l am.
No, no. l mean enjoy being here
on this planet as long as it lasts.
l mean, maybe the Cylons come back,
maybe they don't,
but for now, right now...
we've got a break.
l've got people that wanna get off
the ship... move down here.
Can't say as l blame them.
l mean, what are you gonna do?
Is this how you fight your enemies, Chief?
Is this how you fight for your life?
No excuses.
Show me you're a soldier.
Get up!
<i>(applause/cheering)</i>
Come on! Nice, Admiral!
Is that what you want?
Is that what you want, Admiral?
<i>(Starbuck)</i> Nice, Admiral!
The old man's got chops. Knows when
to make his moves, when to hold back.
l wish l could say the same for his son.
Come on!
l bring offerings.
Just in time.
l was running on bingo fuel.
Wow, look at that.
You literally drank Anders under the table.
- Where's Dee?
- Oh, she packed it in to go pack.
<i>(sniggers)</i>
Guess it's just you and me, then.
Yep. It's just you and me.
Come on, Dad!
- <i>(Tigh)</i> That's it.
- <i>(bell/horn)</i>
That's bad.
That's enough, already. You should quit.
Stop the blood.
Coagulant for the swelling,
ice for the bleeding.
- Godsdammit.
- You insist on doing this? You're crazy.
- You wanna do this?
- Yeah.
Keep your guard up. He's coming in wild.
Get him with a left hook. You wanna win?
l'm not gonna win.
You've gotta watch his jab. His jab's
killing you. Just keep your eyes open.
OK, you're looking good.
Keep strong.
Chief, good morning.
Good morning, Cally.
- Admiral.
- l've been thinking about what you said.
A battlestar's no place to raise a family.
So l'm gonna miss you, Chief.
l wanna wish you good luck.
Thank you, sir.
- My best to both of you.
- You mean it? Really? Thank you.
l want you guys to have at least a dozen.
We'll see about that.
- <i>(Starbuck)</i> Hang in there, Admiral.
- <i>(man)</i> Get out of the corner!
Come on! You've gotta move!
<i>(Tigh)</i> Let's get you up.
Come on, Bill.
When you stand on this deck,
you be ready to fight or you dishonour
the reason why we're here.
Now, remember this:
when you fight a man,
he's not your friend.
Same goes when you lead men.
l forgot that once.
l let you get too close -
all of you.
l dropped my guard.
l gave some of you breaks,
let some of you go,
before the fight was really over.
l let this crew and this family...
disband.
And we paid the price in lives.
That can't happen again.
Figurski, you're with me.
Let's get that bird back on the line.
- Madam President.
- Admiral.
All right. This dance is over.
Get your booze and your dog tags
and let's get out of here.
- So, what, you're just gonna call it?
- Not enough excitement for you, Captain?
<i>(man)</i> Yo, this is your beer, right?
Hey. Hey!
Where the frak do you think you're going?
It's over, Kara.
You have the guts to try and frak another
man's woman, but not to fight one?
l wonder if Dee knew
what she was getting.
Think she would've settled
for sloppy seconds?
Truth stings, don't it?
You want a fight, Captain...
you got it.
- <i>(cheering)</i>
- Yeah!
<i>(bell/horn)</i>
Oh, yeah!
<i>(giggles)</i>
Come on.
You afraid to hit me?
Or maybe you can't.
Check it out.
It's a great place for a house.
- So you're really gonna give up flying?
- Flying's gonna suck now, anyway.
Lots of training, endless CAPs.
The war's over.
So is all the good stuff.
Give me a tour...
of the future life of Kara Anders.
l'm not getting married.
Well, then what's the point, Kara?
l mean,
you love him, right?
Where are we going with this, Lee?
Well, now, that's the question, isn't it?
Where are we going?
l mean,
what if this is... this is it?
The rest of your life, Kara.
Is this how you wanna spend it?
Is this who you wanna spend it with?
- What's going on?
- What's it look like?
Looks like they're trying to kill each other.
That's one perspective.
Oh! <i>(giggles)</i>
Well, that makes things
more complicated.
Yeah.
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?
We accept it.
Tomorrow, l tell Dee, you tell Sam.
- Just like that?
- Just like that.
l don't know.
Yeah, we tell them how we feel.
We shout it to the skies.
<i>(laughs)</i> Yeah, right.
What? You...
you don't think l will?
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
Lee! <i>(giggles)</i>
My name is Lee Adama!
And l love Kara Thrace!
<i>(laughs)</i>
Calm down.
It's not like anybody will hear.
We're in your cabin in the forest, right?
<i>(giggles)</i>
l love Kara Thrace
and l don't care who frakkin' knows!
<i>(laughs)</i>
Oh, Lee, you're crazy.
Get down.
Come on. l'm not gonna stop
until you get up and do it, too.
l can't.
- OK, here we go again. Lee Adama!
- OK, OK, OK.
OK.
<i>(gasps)</i>
OK.
Ka...
Kara Thrace loves Lee Adama!
Get up. Starbuck, get up.
You can do this.
Morning, Admiral.
You look like you had a good time.
Yeah, it was some party.
It's been a hell of a morning, too.
You missed all the excitement.
- There's problems upstairs?
- No. No, good things.
Kara got married.
You believe that?
- What?
- Yeah. About an hour ago.
Found herself a priest,
went down by the river, and got married.
Are you OK?
<i>(Adama)</i> Can you believe that?
<i>(chuckles)</i>
Well, she deserves it.
We all deserve to be happy.
l also gave her permission to muster out,
along with Tyrol and Cally,
and a few of the others.
It'll be up to us to make sure
there's no mass exodus.
Hey, man.
Did you hear the news?
We're hitched. We got married!
Can you believe it?
No. No, l can't believe it.
Yeah. You know, it was crazy. She comes
and wakes me up, she pops the question,
she drags me down to the priest,
and bang, like that, we're married.
So it was your idea?
Yeah. It was my idea.
Do you guys...
do you guys want a minute to, uh...
you know, talk?
- Congratulations, Sam.
- Yeah.
And good luck.
You're gonna need it.
<i>(man)</i> That's it.
<i>(woman)</i> Watch that pretty face!
<i>(man)</i> Hey, come on.
l'm outta here.
<i>(Starbuck)</i> l've missed you.
l missed...
l missed you, too.
- Jot this down.
- OK.
Hey!
Jeez.
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>
l was burnt out.
l started taking... stims.
- What are these?
- Stims.
And by the look of it,
she's been taking them by the handful.
Coming in late cos you're hungover is
bad, but when you back out on a mission?
Unlike you,
l don't take a bunch of pills
and then climb in my cockpit so wired
that l can't land the frakking ship.
Starbuck, you're an embarrassment.
l need you back in the CIC.
It just ain't the same without you in there...
intimidating the inmates.
No, no.
There are 12 Cylon models. But in the
occupation on New Caprica, l saw seven.
- Who are the final five?
- l can't talk about that.
<i>(Baltar)</i> What is it talking about?
<i>(Number Six)</i> Most Cylons think
the mind of the hybrid has gone mad
and the vocalisations
are meaningless.
But not everyone thinks that.
You'll delete the order from your logs.
Execute.
<i>(gunshot)</i>
<i>(gasps)</i>
It's OK. It's OK.
There is something beautiful...
miraculous,
between life and death.
There's no food to be salvaged?
What about the good food we had stored
before we started
churning out the contaminated stuff?
The newly processed bad food
went into the depleted storage system.
Everything's tainted.
<i>(Cottle) Sharon's finding algae</i>
<i>for us to process.</i>
It's tough to choke down,
but it's almost pure protein.
What if Sharon comes back and reports
there is no clear passage to this planet?
Then the question is, Doc,
how long can we survive?
With the rations we've been on?
l'd say seven to ten days.
- <i>(Roslin) When is she due back?</i>
- She was due three hours ago.
The, uh, radiation levels are high,
but she's strong and...
she's, uh...
She'll be here any moment.
- No, l'm sorry. l don't have anything.
- To share.
l told you, Starbuck, l don't have anything.
Get off my back.
- l saw a protein bar.
- l gave it to Cottle.
Right. Right after l gave him head.
- Now l'm a liar?!
- If the shoe fits...
All right, can it!
Kat, get down here.
All right. For frak's sake, everybody eat.
We're getting paranoid over this hunger.
<i>(Kat)</i> Here, baby. Eat this.
<i>(Starbuck)</i> Oh, my gods, that's good.
<i>(alarm)</i>
<i>(Baltar)</i> Somewhere to be, D'Anna?
<i>(Number Three)</i> Ssh. You'll wake Caprica.
l'd love to hang around with you two
all day, but... l got things to do.
l'll never understand
what you all do all day long,
living on this thing
like fleas on a cat.
Where do you suppose
she takes herself off to, then?
- You're not the only one asking that.
- l'm not?
What do you mean?
- She's been doing things.
- "Doing things"?
What things?
<i>(loud hissing)</i>
<i>(talking drowned out by noise)</i>
<i>(man)</i> Go ahead,
l've got your helmet.
- There you go. Got you.
- <i>(man #2)</i> Easy.
<i>(man)</i> Prepare the starboard side
for wash down.
- All the way down to fifth.
- <i>(man #2)</i> Right through here, Lieutenant.
Radiation negative.
There's a way
through the star cluster.
And l found the planet,
on the other side.
l skimmed it, l took photos.
There's huge swaths of algae,
just like we thought.
- It's black.
- <i>(Apollo)</i> She's a Cylon.
She can handle
a radiation dose that big.
- We think. Someone call Cottle!
- l'm fine.
Maybe you are, but...
a human might not be able to make it.
So then how do we get tens of thousands
of humans through there?
<i>(Sharon)</i> So we can make it through
in two jumps with a stop right there.
- There's no solution with a single jump?
- The cluster's too big.
It's too big to go around, too.
Civvy ships aren't shielded enough
to jump in the middle of that radiation.
l would say 80% of the people
on board would die.
- Can we send <i>Galactica</i> for food?
- And put it where?
- What?
- It'd take dozens of trips.
Each time we'd leave the fleet vulnerable.
We can't bring the food to the people.
What if we bring the people to the food,
put the people on <i>Galactica?</i>
Send the civilian ships with skeleton crew,
give them radiation meds.
Except that the radiation
would fry the civvy ships' nav systems.
They wouldn't be able to see squat. There
wouldn't be a way to calculate a jump out.
It's worse than that. Once you jump in,
the light is so blinding you begin to drift,
and before you can get your bearings...
you're over there.
<i>(Apollo)</i> No visual contact.
Instruments blinded by radiation.
They'd get lost, they'd burn up.
Pilot ship.
We pair a Raptor
with each civilian ship.
Raptor navigation systems are hardened.
They could handle the radiation.
Each Raptor leads a civilian ship
through the cluster,
then they both jump out together.
The question is...
how many jumps will it take?
Five round trips.
You heard. Five round trips.
On our outbound jumps,
we'll each be responsible
for relaying jump coordinates
to our own specific civilian ship,
nailing them to jump points
and ensuring they don't drift off.
Sir, will we get fed
when we get there?
Eventually, yes, but only after
we find the algae and get it processed.
Oh!
But the truth is, nausea from radiation
exposure will take care of our appetites.
You'll all be issued with
radiation badges to track our exposure.
White, like this, you're OK.
As your exposure increases, it'll darken.
If it approaches this,
you'll be pulled from duty.
Keep checking your badges.
It's every pilot's own responsibility
to monitor their own badge.
Starbuck.
Remember, we're all flying solo
on this mission.
So there'll be nobody
to bitch slap you if you get tired
or start seeing toasters on your wing.
We'll be issuing stims, so use them.
Are you crazy?
We can't use stims.
- Problem?
- Stims amp up your metabolism.
We've got nothing to burn.
We'll be flying into the sides of the ships.
- They'd mess us up?
- You used to like stims, Kat.
Personal discretion on the stims.
We're taking the first load of civilians
on board as we speak.
That's it.
Skids up in four hours.
<i>(Dualla)</i> There is no food here. There are
no rations anywhere on this ship.
If someone told you there was food,
they were lying!
If you leave this area,
force will be used.
Once we get through the star cluster, you
will be returned to your designated ships.
Sacha!
<i>(man)</i> Keep following.
Down to the front.
My name isn't "Sacha".
My name is Captain Louanne Katraine,
you understand me?
Sacha and you
were a lifetime ago.
Right, right.
Cos you got this now, right?
No more hanging
with the sinners, huh?
Stay away from me.
Do you understand me?
Do they even know
who you really are?
Fancy bumping into you here.
Can you believe l'm lost again?
l can never find my way around this place.
Where have you been?
l've been talking with Simon about our
move toward Earth. There's some debate.
Of course, if l spoke to the relevant Simon
he'd ascertain you were at this meeting?
Beg your pardon?
l hear that you've been
going off by yourself, "doing things".
Really?
Now, who would tell you
anything about <i>my</i> business?
- So it's true?
- Caprica?
Did you know you have
some dried goo in your hair?
That can happen
when you resurrect.
Now l understand what you've been
doing with yourself all these afternoons.
Do you have any idea
what you are accusing me of?
Yes...
Intentionally killing yourself over and over
so you can download over and over.
But death's just
a revolving door, isn't it?
Come here!
Ooh!
What do you want?!
Take it down a notch, baby. Relax.
l'm not looking for a business partner.
l told you to stay the frak
away from me.
Yeah, cos if they find out who you are,
they'll kick you out the service, or worse.
Now, do you think l want that?
l don't want that,
cos if that happens...
who's gonna feed me? <i>(sniggers)</i>
Oh, come on,
you're getting three squares.
We don't.
And l don't have anything stashed, Enzo.
Yeah, sure you don't.
Oh, we go back, baby.
Since when is it a crime to...
take care of your own? Hm?
Remember, l know who you are,
and l know how to make you happy.
Get your hands off of me.
Colonel.
Go ahead.
- <i>(man)</i> Welcome back, sir.
- <i>(woman)</i> Good to see you, sir.
<i>(man #2)</i> Colonel's back on board.
- <i>(man #3)</i> Welcome, sir.
- <i>(man #4)</i> It's good to see you, sir.
- <i>(man #5)</i> We're with you, sir.
- <i>(man #6)</i> Welcome back.
Enough!
Don't you people have jobs to do?
- Welcome back, Colonel.
- Admiral.
Apollo, <i>Galactica.</i>
Launch Raptors on your orders.
<i>(Apollo) Shepherds, find your sheep.</i>
<i>Stay close. Never let them go.</i>
<i>These crews are counting on us.</i>
- <i>Apollo, Starbuck on station.</i>
- <i>(Kat) l got visual on "Chiron".</i>
<i>(Apollo) Hotdog.</i>
<i>"Adriatic" in sight. OK.</i>
When you jump in,
you'll be disoriented.
<i>Take it one step at a time.</i>
<i>Find your sheep, work the jump</i>
<i>calculations and get them out.</i>
<i>Remember, we do not stay</i>
<i>beyond our radiation-dose limit.</i>
<i>(Hoshi)</i> Apollo reports
pilots in position, sir.
Initiate jump on his command.
<i>Galactica</i> will follow.
<i>(man)</i> Aye aye, sir.
Raptors, Apollo.
We jump on my mark.
- <i>Three, two...</i>
- Jumping...
<i>... one. Mark.</i>
Whoa!
What is this?
l can't see anything.
Frak!
Oh!
Ah! Got you!
- Kat, you got yours?
- <i>Affirmative, Apollo.</i>
Only got eyes for the <i>Chiron.</i>
Relaying coordinates.
Squadron, Apollo.
l have <i>Thera Sita.</i>
<i>Relaying jump coordinates</i>
<i>to her right now.</i>
Apollo, Starbuck. l got mine.
Frak. l'm just barely holding on here.
l lost mine! Has anyone seen <i>Adriatic?</i>
She has lost her jump coordinates.
<i>(Helo) Hotdog, negative!</i>
<i>Negative on Adriatic.</i>
Hotdog, ease off
on the control, man!
Ease up with the stick.
It's a Raptor.
Frak it, frak it!
Apollo, it's <i>Galactica</i> actual.
<i>You've reached your radiation-dose limit.</i>
<i>You've got to jump.</i>
- Count us down.
- <i>(Apollo) Roger that.</i>
No! Hold on!
Apollo, please wait.
<i>Hotdog, listen!</i>
<i>We have to get out of here!</i>
l can find them!
l can find them! Hold on!
- Please wait!
- <i>(Apollo) Jump on my mark!</i>
- <i>Please, wait!</i>
- <i>(Apollo) One, two...</i>
- No! Please! Wait!
- <i>Mark!</i>
<i>(Hotdog)</i>
<i>We can't leave without them!</i>
Frak! Frak!
Jump complete.
DRADIS is back online.
Ship reports moderate hull damage.
<i>"Galactica", Apollo.</i>
<i>First trip complete.</i>
Raptors, land your birds
and prepare to jump back
for the second group of civilians.
We lost the <i>Adriatic.</i>
- It's only our first jump.
- Yes, it is.
<i>(alarm)</i>
<i>Carina,</i> Kat!
Report your location!
Kat, Apollo.
Do you have the <i>Carina?</i>
Negative!
Radiation's pissing on my nav.
l can't see jack!
OK. l found her.
- No! Frak!
- <i>(Apollo) Kat! Kat, report!</i>
Godsdammit!
<i>(Apollo) All right, Kat!</i>
<i>Time's up. We're jumping on my mark!</i>
- <i>Three, two, one... Mark!</i>
- Godsdammit! The <i>Carina!</i>
l lost...
l lost her.
<i>(Apollo)</i> All right. We managed
to get another eight ships through,
but we still lost one.
We gotta get better
at tracking our sheep.
Quicker reaction times
out of the jumps.
Racetrack, don't be calling out
coordinates to the wrong ship.
l got mixed up.
Keep checking your instruments,
and recheck them.
The instruments are crap.
All right.
That concludes Outbound Four.
This is Return Four.
One to go.
All right, get some rest.
Come on.
Here's the report from the doc.
A hundred marines too weak to work.
Two hundred more are ready to drop.
That's gonna
slow down the harvest.
Last batch of passengers
kicked up some trouble.
You... you get these people
to the other side
and they think there's a diner and a chef
waiting to take their order.
l know.
When they gonna learn they gotta
process the thing first, for frak's sake?
Try telling that
to a bunch of empty stomachs.
l hear they're still eating paper.
Is that true?
No... Paper shortage.
Not a good sign.
No, sir.
So, while you resurrect
do you see the faces of the final five?
The ones that no one's seen.
What do you want
to know about them?
l could be a Cylon.
l would stop being a traitor
to one set of people...
and be a hero to another.
l'd have a place to belong.
You would help me
understand my destiny.
- Have you seen my face?
- Your face?
Yes, my face.
Can't remember.
l've been trying to get it all down on paper
while it's still fresh in my mind,
but nothing much comes out.
It's rubbish. l can't remember.
Cylons, humans...
We're all just trying to discover...
who we are.
Aren't we?
Hey, Enzo.
Yeah.
l took the name Louanne Katraine
from a girl who died
two days before
the attack on Caprica.
It got me through
the background checks.
Yeah, times were rough.
Keep going.
l was a drug runner.
Enzo was my supplier.
What do you want? We were truckers,
OK? We just moved stuff.
People?
You see, some think that that's the way
that the Cylons infiltrated Caprica.
They seeded themselves in the colonies,
then used criminals
to get them into the capital.
Anyone who's found guilty of helping
the Cylons is considered a traitor.
- We didn't carry Cylons.
- How do you know?
- Cos nobody knew they looked like us.
- Then how do you know you didn't?!
- How do you know?
- You think l'm a traitor?
You think l'm a traitor?
No.
l don't think you're a traitor.
You're a "smart young woman".
That's what the old man said.
You're just not smart enough
to accept who you are.
You see, you lied your way
into the company of good people.
Starbuck, don't tell the admiral.
Please... Please don't, or I...
Or what?
Starbuck, please.
Just let me tell him myself.
Please just let me.
Can you do that?
Gods.
<i>(sobs)</i>
<i>(Hybrid)</i> One degree...
Angle nominal...
Seascape portrait of
the woman-child cavern of the soul...
Under pressure-heat ratio...
Lines of evolution
have buried their fuse...
So this is where you got the idea
to start intentionally downloading.
Gestalt therapy
and escape clauses...
Right, let's see
what we can find out.
<i>(Hybrid)</i> Throughout history,
the nexus between man and machine
has spun some of
the most dramatic, compelling...
Gaius...
what do you think you're doing?
Don't touch it!
Intelligence.
A mind that burns like a fire.
Yes. l'm here.
Find the hand that lies
in the shadow of the light.
In the eye of the husband
of the eye of the cow.
Are you all right?
It just speaks nonsense,
doesn't it?
l don't think
anything it says is nonsense.
"The husband of the eye."
"The eye of the..."
Hera.
Hera is sometimes referred to
as "cow-eyed Hera".
- And the husband of Hera...
- Is Jupiter.
The Eye of Jupiter.
That's written about in the ancient texts.
Oh, gods.
Could there be a connection
between their gods and ours?
What does it mean?
It's a location.
A planet hidden in the shadow of light -
probably a cluster of stars.
That will lead us
to the Eye of Jupiter.
And to the hand...
"hidden in the shadow of light".
It's probably
some type of artefact.
A hand.
As in five.
Five faces.
Now all we have to do
is find the right planet...
the right star cluster.
Accept who you are.
<i>Accept who you are.</i>
Yeah.
Remember me?
Yeah.
Yeah, l remember you.
Thieving bastard.
You'll ruin everything l've got.
Come here.
<i>Faru Sadin,</i> report your location.
Kat! You got <i>Faru Sadin?</i>
<i>Kat, have you got "Faru Sadin"? Kat?</i>
<i>Kat, report.</i>
Negative.
Kat.
Frak! l've lost the <i>Faru Sadin.</i>
Sir. Escalating damage reports,
ship-wide.
Engineers are reporting
a cascade of pressure failures.
Jump spot's become unstable.
We gotta get out of here.
- Open line.
- <i>(Hoshi)</i> Aye, sir.
Channel open.
Apollo, <i>Galactica</i> actual.
Jump all.
<i>Repeat, jump all.</i>
All right, admiral's calling it.
Everyone, jump on my mark.
- l'm not losing another one.
- Three, two, one... Mark!
Apollo, Starbuck.
l don't see Kat.
Report.
We're missing <i>Faru Sadin</i>
and one Raptor.
It's Kat. She must have missed the order.
She's still out there.
Damn.
<i>Faru Sadin,</i> this is Kat.
Report your location.
Frak!
<i>(Tigh)</i> Come on, kid.
Come on home.
<i>(Hoshi)</i> It's them!
She brought 'em home!
<i>Galactica,</i> Kat.
Mission accomplished.
- They said you wanted to see me.
- <i>(weakly)</i> Yeah.
l don't think we should end
the way we ended.
Listen, um...
everybody is...
Everybody is stuck...
with the things that they're not proud of.
And that, uh...
that thing about "good people", I, uh...
l didn't mean that.
Yeah, l know.
Here.
Take these. Sleeping pills.
Enough.
So, uh... take them if you want.
Thank you.
l got to go.
Admiral, I...
l know. l'm... l'm sorry.
l'm not here to lecture.
l'm letting you know
about a promotion.
l'm making you CAG again.
Sir, you know
l'm not getting out of here, right?
But you earned it.
What you did
was harder than facing a bullet,
and you did it without
putting one other soul in harm's way.
l don't know
if l could've done that.
l wish there was
something more l could give.
No.
It's good.
l would like to be CAG very much.
Thank you.
Listen... There's a...
There's a thing...
a reason why
you might not want to do this.
Kara knows what it is...
but l wanted to tell you myself.
l don't need to know anything
other than what l already know.
When you were CAG,
you protected your people,
made them feel safe enough
to be brave.
What you were gonna say
doesn't change that.
Are you... staying?
Oh, l'm staying.
l love this sickbay, in a way.
It reminds me of
where my son Zak was born.
Carolanne was so happy.
She was convinced,
both times,
that she was having a girl.
So it was a surprise at the end.
Did you want a girl, too?
Yeah.
Three's a good round number.
l need your verdict on this one.
What if?
- l hate it.
- Ah.
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>
My name is Lee Adama!
And l love Kara Thrace!
<i>(Anders) Did you hear the news?</i>
We got married.
Can you believe it?
No. No, l can't believe it.
Congratulations, Sam.
And good luck - you're gonna need it.
- l missed you.
- l missed you too.
The child's life must be protected
at all costs.
The first Cylon-human hybrid
truly is a miracle from God.
This child will not be raised by the Cylon,
and we cannot risk Cylon agents getting
their hands on it. l've made my decision.
We lost her. We did the best we could,
but she's dead.
And that's all there is to it.
As far as the Cylons know, this child no
longer exists. That is a good, good thing.
<i>(baby cries)</i>
It's Hera, the first of God's new generation.
Have you seen the faces of the other five
Cylons, the ones no one has seen?
- Why do you want to know about them?
- l could be a Cylon.
- l thought the supply was inexhaustible.
- Food manufacturing's contaminated.
If we hold on until Athena gets back,
this algae can keep us alive indefinitely.
There was a way through the star cluster,
and l found the planet.
<i>There's huge swaths of algae,</i>
<i>just like we thought.</i>
- <i>(man)</i> 14-inch intake?
- <i>(man #2)</i> Yeah, that's great.
This can go in the first Raptor,
that in the second.
- Need a hand?
- Yeah.
Couple more days, we can wrap this up,
get away from this stench.
It's as bad up here as it is down there.
At least it tastes as good as it smells.
Well, it's breakfast, lunch and dinner
until someone finds a hot-fudge planet.
Oh, what is this?
Who the hell is that?
Starbuck, l guess.
Third time this week.
It's amazing how she keeps landing
on the top of the pilot rotation.
Well, uh...
Doughnut runs are assigned off a coin flip.
Kara probably thinks
she's running a stream of bad luck.
- l should probably get over there.
- l'll skip the meet-and-greet this time.
Sure.
- You brought her in a little hot.
- Well, had l known l was being graded,
l would have thrown in
a couple of barrel rolls.
Remind me to thank the CAG for sticking
me on these crap doughnut runs, huh?
This is insane, you know.
That's just the way l like it.
Shall we start emptying the tents?
Yeah, get this cleared up first,
and then get to the tents.
OK.
l can barely look Dee in the eye.
We gotta do something about this.
OK. Like what?
l don't know. Like divorce.
No. Uh-uh.
Let's get real here.
You said yourself things were bad,
your marriage was failing.
Yeah, but marriage is a sacrament.
It's not a Pyramid game.
You don't... you don't get do-overs, Lee.
l made a vow in the sight of the gods,
and l am not gonna break that.
You're breaking it every time we do this.
Every time.
Divorce is different.
This is just bending the rules.
No, l'm sorry. l can't...
l can't live like this.
Every time l look at my wife,
l see my own guilt reflected in her eyes.
Wow, Lee, that is really poetic of you,
but you don't need
to make that big of a deal out of this.
Well, it is a big deal, Kara. It is.
It is.
Great.
So, l won't divorce, and you won't cheat.
So where does that leave us?
Trapped.
<i>(baby cries)</i>
Who are the final five?
l could be a Cylon.
<i>(screams)</i>
<i>(baby cries)</i>
She's not well.
What's the matter, Hera?
Shh.
It's OK, Hera.
It's OK.
Shh.
l'm here for you.
<i>(Chief)</i> Radiocarbon dating suggests
the temple's at least 4,000 years old,
which lines up with the exodus
of the thirteenth tribe.
<i>(Roslin) You found the Temple of Five?</i>
Yeah. l recognise it from the books
in my father's study, Madam President.
He was a priest, and the Temple of Five
was an important part of our... his faith.
Could this place be related
to the Eye of Jupiter, Chief?
You got me.
All l know is the stuff l kind of remember
from sneaking into my dad's study.
The Eye of Jupiter?
What exactly are we talking about?
According to the scriptures, it's a marker
left behind by the thirteenth tribe.
- It's supposed to point the way to Earth.
- <i>(alarm blares)</i>
Chief, we're on alert.
This is Adama.
Lieutenant Gaeta, CIC.
We have multiple DRADIS contacts.
- <i>Four Cylon baseships jumped into view.</i>
- On our way.
- SITREP.
- Four baseships inbound at high speed.
Four?
Bastards practically jumped on top of us.
Fleet's spooling up their FTL drives.
Preparing to jump to standby coordinates.
- Do it.
- Aye, sir.
We gotta hold this position
until everyone's back on board.
- How many are down there?
- Enough.
If the Eye of Jupiter is in that temple
and is a marker to Earth...
We can't let the Cylons get their hands
on it. Stand by to launch Vipers.
Something's odd here.
Cylons aren't launching Raiders.
Baseships are standing off,
outside of weapons range.
That is odd.
Admiral.
It's the Cylon baseship,
requesting to speak with you.
Put it through to speaker.
This is Admiral Adama.
<i>(Baltar) Admiral, l can't tell you</i>
<i>what a genuine pleasure it is</i>
<i>to hear your voice.</i>
<i>This is Gaius Baltar.</i>
<i>(Roslin)</i> l can't believe
we're allowing Cylons on this ship.
They must want something pretty bad
or else they would have started shooting.
Why send Baltar? They gotta know
we won't believe a word he says.
He can say what he wants.
The longer he talks,
the more time we have to get Lee
and his people off the planet.
Feels like old times.
l can't believe how much
l miss this place.
You know you can't return.
They'd toss you out the nearest air lock
and then throw a party.
Yes, l know.
Still, l can't help feeling l'm finally... home.
If you're really a Cylon,
a member of the final five,
these feelings are just part
of your programming, part of your cover.
And if l'm a human being after all?
If l'm not one of the final five, this is the
last chance l get to see my kind again.
- Colonel, wait.
- Well, look at this. Should we salute?
That's Boomer.
The one who shot the old man?
Well, you just lost your visiting privileges.
- Hold that thing here until we get back.
- Yes, sir.
You three, keep on moving.
Laura.
Laura, my...
It's good to see you.
Weapons are hardly necessary.
Yes, exactly.
We come in peace.
What do you want?
We want the Eye of Jupiter.
So let's skip the denials and protestations
and go straight to it.
We know that you have people
on the ground.
And we know that you've found the
original settlement of the thirteenth tribe.
It also doesn't take
a lot of deduction to conclude
that the only reason you haven't cut
your losses and jumped away by now
is that you've probably found the artefact,
but you haven't been able to retrieve it yet.
Is that about right?
We have our people on the surface.
We're not leaving them behind.
That's a touching,
but not very convincing, idea.
The chances we've all converged on this
small planet at the same time are small.
So we all understand it's not chance.
You want the Eye,
the Cylons want the Eye.
l'd like to discuss the practical issues,
so we can reach some accommodation.
The less this man says,
the better this will go.
Wait a minute.
If it wasn't for me, the Cylons
would have blown you out of the sky.
l think you can handle this alone.
If you can stomach it.
So l've saved your life - again.
How many times is that now?
l'm losing count.
If it wasn't for me, you'd all be dead!
What's your offer?
You give us the Eye of Jupiter,
we let you go.
- And... we'll throw in Baltar.
- What are you talking about now?
l'm improvising.
Throwing something sweet in the pot.
Besides, l suspect that the admiral
and Madam President
would enjoy some nice quiet,
private time with their former leader.
Am l right?
Worth thinking about.
Definitely worth thinking about.
Despite that uniform,
it's not your home any more.
l've made my choice,
and l know where my loyalties lie.
What if l told you
that your daughter was still alive?
- l'd say you were lying.
- Well, someone's lying.
But it's not me.
Hera's alive.
At least for now.
She's ill and we don't know why.
Yeah, right.
Baltar found her on New Caprica
during the evacuation.
She's on our baseship right now.
From what we could gather,
she was hidden at Laura Roslin's school,
which means that she probably
planned the whole thing in the first place.
- l don't need to listen to this. Watch her.
- They let you think that she was dead.
You don't do that to a person,
but to a thing!
That's what your friends think of you.
You're not one of them! You're a thing!
We're not giving you
the key to finding Earth.
You try bringing it up from that planet
and see what happens.
We outnumber you four to one.
l'm setting the terms now.
Make any attempt to attack this ship
or the people on the planet's surface,
l'll launch every nuke l've got.
Lay waste to the entire continent.
You're bluffing.
You wanna find out as much as we do.
- Guards, escort them back to their ship.
- Yes, sir.
It would help if l knew what l was looking
for. Does it really look like an eye?
l don't know.
The scriptures make reference to the Eye
being left in some sort of temple,
but there's no physical description.
All we know for sure
is it supposedly points the way to Earth.
And you believe that?
The Cylons do.
l can't take a chance they were right.
If it looks like they're gonna get
into the temple, your order is to blow it.
- Understood. What's...
- <i>(alarm blares)</i>
What's going on?
The Cylons are jamming the wireless.
Every frequency.
OK, we need to establish
our communications.
Work out a plan to defend this temple
while Tyrol searches.
Defend it with what? A dozen marines?
Maybe five more military?
- They'd have to draft the civilians.
- Can l make a suggestion you won't like?
Do you make any other kind?
Use Sam to command the civilians.
You're not serious?
- Lee.
- Hey, Sam.
Hi.
Heard you were coming down.
Guess it takes an emergency
to get us in the same room these days.
Can we do this later, please?
Sam, l need you to command the civilians.
Form them into fire teams.
- l'll give my deployment orders through...
- Whoa, whoa, wait. Deployment orders?
Fire teams? Come on. Some of these guys
have never even held a rifle before.
You're supposed to be the expert
in turning civilians into soldiers.
We were guerrilla fighters. Hit and run.
Keep moving, keep the enemy off balance.
l've never had to defend a fixed position.
That's a different game.
Well, you're just gonna
have to learn it fast.
We're defending this position
until Chief finds this Eye.
OK, so you want us to risk our lives for
something you haven't even found yet?!
Sam, l'm not even sure it exists.
But l don't have to tell you every detail...
- What you have to explain to me...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
The major's in charge of this one, OK?
- OK?
- Mm.
l certainly wouldn't want
to step between you and your major.
- Well, l thought that went really well.
- He'll do it.
He'd better.
l miss Nicky.
Do you think he's OK?
Yes, he's fine. He's fine.
l know.
You know, when l was growing up,
l hated everything about the faith -
the rules, the rituals,
endless discussions at the dinner table.
l used to sneak into my mom's
prayer room, the holiest of the holies,
and l would dance around naked
with porn magazines just to defy the gods
and tell them to frak off.
l don't even know how l found this place.
l just got this urge to start walking,
and then, suddenly, here it is.
Well, you should see the look on your face
when you're in here.
There's this... reverence.
You even talk softer.
l feel something in here.
Something true.
But here l am setting charges
in this special place.
The holiest of the holies.
This is the Temple of Five.
If my parents could see this.
And l'm gonna blow it up.
<i>(Gaeta)</i> l noticed some anomalies
in the solar radiation belt.
l made an analysis
of the star's vibration modes.
Sure enough, it appears
to be highly unstable -
if you can believe it,
on the verge of going supernova.
When?
It could be tomorrow, could be next year.
There's no way of knowing for sure, sir.
When it does happen,
the only warning that we're likely to get
is a fast helium flash, at which point
we'll have to jump out of here
before it obliterates
the entire planetary system.
Sir, l'm not one to look for religious signs,
but l can't get my head around these odds.
That human and Cylon both converge
on this planet at this exact moment,
just as this star is about to go supernova?
l'm not a religious person, Mr Gaeta,
as you well know.
So if this is the work
of a higher power,
then they have
one hell of a sense of humour.
We have a standoff.
Very predictable.
They have the Eye,
and they'll nuke it if we try to take it.
And we'll shoot them down
if they try bringing it up to <i>Galactica.</i>
Are we sure they have it?
How do we know they're not bluffing?
You don't.
We Threes feel
that we can't afford to take the chance.
l think we're missing the big picture here.
We have the opportunity
to rid the universe
of the human pestilence,
once and for all.
We can discuss that after we get the Eye
of Jupiter, after we find the path to Earth.
Let me point out that it doesn't matter
if we find Earth in five days,
or if we find Earth in 5,000 years.
We're machines, we'll still be around
to savour the great miracle.
So let them destroy the Eye,
if indeed they have it.
We have to take advantage of the situation
and take down <i>Galactica</i>
once and for all.
Or we could stand here and do nothing.
We're not doing nothing, Cavil.
- Plans are in motion.
- l'm sorry. What is that?
D'Anna.
l put a heavy Raider down on the planet's
surface as soon as we jumped in.
l thought that would be our best chance
of slipping by their DRADIS.
Seems l was right.
Was there any reason the rest of us
weren't involved in this?
It was a need-to-know mission. So now l
am telling you because you need to know.
We cut off their troops' communications
and put our own troops on the ground.
So as soon as the Centurions retrieve
the Eye, you can take out <i>Galactica.</i>
OK, here's the deal.
We're out of options.
The Cylons have got us pinned
on this rock, and our only way out of here
is to hold this place until <i>Galactica</i>
can send a rescue party.
So l've divided you into two teams, OK?
Team one is gonna be distributing
ammunition throughout the camp.
Team two is gonna be making
home-made tylium mines.
l know that's not glamorous work,
but we're gonna need the extra firepower
in case the Cylons decide
to take a shot at us.
Look, l know some of you are scared,
and that's OK, cos l'm scared too.
But if we keep our heads and do our jobs,
we can do this.
We can all get out of here. Barolay has a
list of your names and your assignments.
Make sure you get with her.
l'll see you outside.
That was good. Honest.
You'd make a good officer.
Officer, huh?
Like you? Someone who swears an oath
and knows how to keep it?
- l'm not sure what you think's going on...
- Don't insult me, OK? l'm not stupid.
l know my wife.
l know how she is.
We've been married for a year and a half.
What, you think you're the first?
l chose to marry Kara.
That's my business.
But you? l don't know
what the hell you think you're trying to do.
Look, l'm trying to fight a war. l'm trying to
get these people off this rock in one piece.
Anything for the cause, Major.
Gaius, l am on the verge of seeing
the faces of the final five Cylons.
Maybe the face of God Himself.
The five lights of the apocalypse rising,
struggling towards the light,
sins revealed only to those who enter
the temple, only to the Chosen One.
The Chosen One.
The Chosen One. The Chosen One.
The Chosen One. The Chosen One.
- The Chosen One.
- The five await me.
Gaius, l'm so close to knowing the truth.
What truth?
Caprica.
l'd like to think that we three
have shared something,
transcended the barriers
that separate people.
And yet somehow,
the more time goes on,
the more l find myself
on the outside looking in.
Well, that's not the case at all.
Is it?
Because we three,
we're integral, we're part of...
We're finished.
Baltar and my destiny
lies separate from yours, Caprica.
The five lights will be revealed
only to those who enter the temple.
We have to go down to the planet.
Only you and l can see this through.
What are you after?
What is this secret that you keep
pursuing? You have to tell me the truth.
- l love you both.
- We love you too.
But this is something
you cannot share with us.
Something l can't share with you? l loved
you when everyone else wanted you dead.
Now, look, you mustn't misunderstand.
It's not personal.
It's transcendent.
It's like what you said. It's transcendent.
Pray for us, Caprica.
We'll be praying for you.
OK, he wants us to set up
forward observation posts,
wired back to base
for communications.
Obs will be at strategic locations,
giving us as much warning as possible
if there is a Cylon advance.
Since we only have one Raptor,
Captain Thrace will fly point.
Oh, joy.
Wireless is dead,
so if you do make contact, do not engage.
Fly to the closest post, have them
relay the information back to Command.
Note force strength,
direction of march and position.
l have flown recon
once or twice, Lieutenant.
Griggs, you and Varrick are gonna set up
an observation post here.
Henick and Ditko, you go here.
- And who gets lucky number three?
- That would be Sergeant Fischer and me.
- Do you have a problem with that?
- No.
We go in an hour.
Green Base, Foxfire One. Green Base,
Foxfire One, we are open for business.
Son of a bitch.
- Tell me you're sending this.
- She's relaying a message.
It's Centurions!
Starbuck's been hit!
l say again, Starbuck's going down!
There's not much on the Eye
in these scriptures,
but there's interesting stories
about the temple. Listen to this.
"Five pillars of the temple
were fashioned after the five priests
- devoted to the one whose name can't..."
- Laura.
What?
The Cylon we knew as Boomer
arrived with the others.
She told our Sharon
that her child was alive,
and that she was onboard
one of the Cylon baseships.
And that she had been seen
on New Caprica, in your school.
The child is alive.
Yes... yes.
The child was at the school.
Yes, l kept her there.
We suspected that the Cylons captured
her during the exodus from New Caprica.
Yes, it's true.
Listen, the thing you might want to know
is that when...
Do you have any idea
what we've gone through?
You, of all people...
know what it's like to lose a child.
The difference is,
your child is still alive.
Eventually, l hope
you become grateful of that.
l want to see her.
What do you mean, she's gone down?
Gone down where?
Somewhere in the north valley. OK, get
your men on the line. Full ammo loads.
- They're coming from the north.
- We gotta set up a rescue party, right?
Uh, no. We don't have the manpower.
We have to defend the position.
- Lee, she could be dying out there.
- l know that, Sam.
But we are thin on the ground here
and the Cylons are on the march.
We have to hold our positions.
Are you out of your frakkin' mind?
We picked up six Raiders
falling away from the Cylon fleet.
- Definitely heading toward the planet.
- They have to know we see them.
They're testing us. Want to know
if we're bluffing about nuking the planet.
Unfortunately, we are bluffing.
Are we?
- Mr Hoshi.
- Aye, sir.
Order nuclear ground-strike missiles
into launch tubes four through ten.
Aye, sir.
This is a nuclear mission order.
Major's right. We don't have troops
to spare if we're holding this position.
Screw this position! We can take
those hills, use guerrilla tactics.
- That's what l've been talking about.
- That is not the mission. We have orders.
What are you, some goddamn
wind-up tin soldier? This is my wife!
l know who she is! And l have known her
and cared about her a lot longer than you!
You can do whatever the frak you want!
l am going after my wife!
- Missiles are loaded, Admiral.
- Open launch tube doors.
Doors are open, Admiral.
What are you doing?
Getting ready to nuke the planet.
Radiological detection.
They've opened their missile doors.
He's bluffing.
- l can't let you do that, Sam.
- l am not asking you for permission.
Sergeant Mathias.
Load target package three Bravo.
Set ground zero
to the underground structure.
<i>(Roslin)</i> Are we prepared to sacrifice Lee?
- They're loading a targeting package.
- It's a bluff.
The risk to us is unacceptable.
Turn back the Raiders.
The ships cannot turn back.
He won't launch.
And D'Anna was explicit that she
and Baltar make it to the planet's surface.
<i>(Caprica)</i> Is that what this is really about?
<i>(Chief) And the heavens opened up</i>
<i>and they saw the Eye.</i>
<i>But where is that frakking Eye?</i>
Are you kidding me?
You gonna shoot me now?
l can't let you go.
l need you on the line.
l need you commanding those civilians.
l'm sorry, Sam, but you cannot go.
l'm sorry, too, Major,
but you can't stop me.
Release of nuclear weapons
is now authorised.
Sir.
Slapstick.
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>
There's enough algae on this planet
to feed the entire fleet,
but the star in this system
is highly unstable -
on the verge of going supernova.
We just picked up four baseships
inbound at high speed.
It's just a matter of time until the Cylons
find out what we're up to on this planet.
<i>(screams)</i>
<i>Starbuck is going down.</i>
- l am going after my wife!
- l can't let you...
l am not asking you for permission.
Sergeant Mathias...
What if l told you
your daughter was alive?
l'd say you were a liar.
She's on our baseship.
She's ill, and we don't know why.
<i>l don't know how l found this place. l got</i>
<i>this urge to start walking, then suddenly...</i>
Here it is.
<i>The scriptures say that this temple is the</i>
<i>final resting place of the Eye of Jupiter.</i>
- What exactly are we talking about?
- It's a marker
left behind by the thirteenth tribe.
It's supposed to point the way to Earth.
We want the Eye of Jupiter.
Make any attempt to attack this ship
or the people on the planet's surface,
l'll launch every nuke l've got.
<i>You've got to hold off the Cylons</i>
<i>until the chief finds the Eye of Jupiter.</i>
<i>If it looks like they're going to</i>
<i>get into the temple, blow it.</i>
We have to go to the planet. l am so close
to seeing the faces of the last five Cylons.
The Final Five, revealed only to those who
enter the temple. Only to the Chosen One.
We just picked up six heavy Raiders
heading for the planet.
Order ground-strike missiles.
<i>l'm not gonna let the Cylons</i>
<i>get their hands on the Eye.</i>
Are we prepared to sacrifice Lee?
Missiles are loaded, Admiral.
Release of nuclear weapons
is now authorised.
Mr Gaeta, disable launch
and warhead safeties
on tubes four through ten.
Safeties disabled, warheads...
- <i>(bleeping)</i>
- <i>...are</i> armed.
XO, please input your firing code.
These nukes will obliterate anything
or anyone within 20 clicks of the temple.
l know.
He's going to do it.
Recall the Raiders immediately.
We agree. Bring them back.
We agree. After all this time,
we can't afford to lose everything.
We agree. Bring them back.
If Kara dies out there,
l swear to gods l will kill you myself.
If she dies out there, l'll let you.
What will you do now?
Follow me around with a gun?
Because that is the only way
that l am not going after Kara.
- Private Sykes.
- Sir.
- Get Lieutenant Dualla on the line.
- Yes, sir.
- l'm here.
- Do you have eyeballs on Starbuck?
Negative. No visual on her Raptor,
but l can see smoke from the crash site.
She went down behind a hill
a couple of clicks away.
- Can you get to the Raptor?
<i>- l don't know. It's pretty far away.</i>
<i>- There's minimal cover.</i>
- Is it doable?
l don't know.
The key.
- Standing by.
- <i>(bleeping)</i>
Launch sequence set to auto.
They want the key to finding Earth
as much as we do.
- He won't just destroy it.
- We spoke and the decision's been made.
Fire on my mark.
Sir! The Raiders are turning back.
- Not all of them.
- Correction. Five have turned back.
One is still en route back to the planet.
- What are you doing?
- They won't launch against just one ship.
That's not the issue. We made a decision.
D'Anna has to turn back.
- No.
- <i>(Number Six)</i> Call D'Anna and Baltar.
- Turn them around now.
- No.
What do you mean, "No"?
This is something that we have to do.
He won't launch over one ship. You'll see.
You want me... you want me
to rescue Captain Thrace?
Attempt the rescue.
Yes, sir.
Foxfire One out.
We go.
<i>(Gaeta)</i> Weapons are still hot, Admiral.
Safe all missiles. Close outer doors.
There. You see?
Never over just one ship.
That is not a good sign, my friends.
She defied us, defied the group.
It's not about the Eye of Jupiter,
it's about her.
It's like we don't even
know them any more.
We may have to do something about this.
We may have to do it sooner than later.
If Hera's alive, l'm her mother
and l'm going to get her.
Sharon, baby, listen to me, OK?
We can take a Raptor and fly to the
baseship ourselves. l don't care any more.
We can't.
We'll find another way.
We will.
There is no other way.
Don't ask me to do this, Sharon.
Listen to me.
You have always been the strong one.
You believed in us
when no one else would.
l'm begging you to do this.
Find the courage to do this
for both of us, OK?
l love you.
l love you too.
Ohh.
<i>(drops weapon)</i>
<i>(weeps)</i>
<i>(yells)</i>
Good to close her.
- Wait outside.
- Yes, sir.
Sharon's downloading into another body
aboard a Cylon ship right now, isn't she?
She begged me.
She begged me to do it.
Gods, if you'd...
seen the look in her eyes when I...
She has important information
on our defences. Codes, procedures.
The tactical situation
down on the planet surface.
The Cylons have access
to all of that as well.
She won't betray us.
You know that.
It's why you gave her the uniform.
She may not have a choice.
Did you consider that?
She said she could resist,
that she wouldn't let it happen.
She'll get Hera...
and she'll come back.
That's quite a leap of faith
you've made there, Captain.
And if it involved your family only,
l'd say it was brave.
But you've put the entire fleet in jeopardy.
Are you aware of that?
If you hadn't lied...
and stolen our baby in the first place,
we wouldn't be here at all.
l've certainly played my part
in bringing us to this moment.
And there is plenty of blame
to throw around, and l accept it.
And now all of our lives
are in the hands of Sharon Agathon.
All we can do is hope
that your wife is worthy
of the unconditional trust
you place in her, Captain.
And you as well, Admiral.
<i>(Sharon gasps)</i>
<i>(coughing and spluttering)</i>
Can you tell me what happened?
They wouldn't let me see my daughter...
so my husband shot me.
It was the only way.
Well, it's over now.
The important thing is that you're here.
How's my daughter?
- She's getting worse.
- l wanna see her.
And then what?
What they did to me.
Stealing my baby...
and telling me she was dead.
It proved it.
Hera's safer here.
And so am I.
Before she went down, Starbuck
spotted about 15-plus chrome-jobs
advancing on us from here. To get to us,
they have to come through this canyon.
This is a natural choke point. That's
where we'll ambush them, guerrilla-style.
Our mission is to hold the temple, here.
If we fail we blow it up.
We fall back to these rendezvous points,
and then we head into the mountains,
and we wait for rescue.
It's as good a place as any
to die, l suppose.
What do you think?
It's a nice day for a walk.
<i>- (gunshots)</i>
- Sniper!
Hey, take it easy, Fischer.
Sarge?
Sarge?
<i>(gunfire)</i>
Oh, this is crazy. Come on.
Think. Think!
Galen, it's Major Adama.
- Sir.
<i>- Chief, we're in position.</i>
<i>Any luck finding the Eye of Jupiter?</i>
No. Major, l need more time.
<i>Get on it. The Cylons are on the move.</i>
<i>We'll hold them off as long as we can.</i>
Apollo out.
All right, listen up! Pack your gear
and get ready to move.
<i>(man)</i> Let's get out of here.
- It's so close.
- l know.
The answers to all your questions
are down there in that temple.
What's wrong?
l'm worried, Gaius.
This is what we've been waiting for.
You are the anointed one,
chosen by God to look on the faces
of the Final Five Cylons.
It's already written. You will succeed.
That's what l'm afraid of.
To know the face of God
is to know madness.
The hybrid has looked into the space
between life and death,
and she's seen things
that we cannot conceive of.
But she's been driven mad as a result.
Have faith in God.
Put your life in his hands.
He will guide you to your destiny.
l'm grateful to you.
For everything.
Her destiny will part company
from yours, Gaius.
She's not the Chosen One. You are.
Yes, l know.
l know.
Right here. Got it?
<i>(Apollo)</i> OK, we're set. And now we wait.
What happens if the Cylons
don't dance to the major's tune?
We get splattered
all over these rocks.
Shut up. This is his game, not ours.
We just do what we're told,
and maybe we get outta here.
You really think
these civvies can stop 'em?
They stopped plenty of 'em on Caprica
while we were running for our lives.
OK. Three clankers
just entered our kill zone.
- Gotta be their recon element.
- Sykes, give 'em the signal.
All right, show time. Show time.
All right, they're headed our way.
Don't detonate till they're all the way in.
Wait for it.
Come on, you sons of bitches.
Come on.
Now, now, now.
<i>(Hope)</i> Godsdammit!
Cease fire! They're pulling back!
They're pulling back!
Godsdammit!
Come on!
He's dead. We gotta pull him back.
Sam! Pull it together.
We bought ourselves a little time.
But they'll be back, and with force.
So, dig in. We need to hold 'em off
until Chief finds the Eye.
And keep your eyes out on those ridges.
Have you had any word
from Kara or Dee?
No.
<i>(thud)</i>
Starbuck? Starbuck!
Dee, why the hell didn't you sing out?
l almost blew you away.
Glad to see you, too.
OK, OK.
It's OK.
- Lee sent you?
- Yup.
My husband... ordered me
to risk my life for yours.
That's what l'm gonna do.
l'm gonna bring Starbuck back to Apollo.
<i>(baby crying)</i>
She's here.
<i>(crying continues)</i>
It's me.
It's Mommy.
What's wrong?
<i>(crying stops)</i>
We tried everything. She didn't respond.
Look at that. Hera knows her.
That's amazing. You and she
are biologically identical.
Hera recognises her mother.
Good. Because you can have her.
l'm done with her.
You don't mean that. l know
you still care about Tyrol, and Adama.
No. l'm done with that part of my life.
l learned that on New Caprica.
Humans and Cylons,
we're not meant to be together.
We should just go our separate ways.
Now lie down.
Her belly is as hard as a rock.
Have you noticed that before?
<i>(Hera cries)</i>
- What do you think that means?
- Blocked intestine, maybe.
Our doctors examined her.
Your doctors
have never examined a child.
<i>(crying continues)</i>
Hera needs to be seen by a human doctor.
l need to take her back to <i>Galactica.</i>
You know that can't happen -
what this child means to us,
- what she means to every Cylon.
- l should have known.
She's been planning this all along.
Feel her.
She's right.
- Her belly's as hard as a gourd.
- If you don't let me take her,
the first of the new generation will die.
- God will never forgive you.
- Maybe Cavil's right.
Maybe God never wanted us
to have children in the first place.
Maybe it'd be better for you
if l just snapped your little neck!
Please...
Please don't kill my baby girl.
Honey!
l believe the future of the Cylon
rests with this child,
and the others
who are gonna come after her.
- So do I.
- There's a captured Raptor aboard.
Let's go. We've gotta
get you back to <i>Galactica.</i>
Here they come. Open fire!
Cover the wounded!
The Cylons are closing in!
- It's the major.
- Tyrol.
- Tell me you've found the Eye of Jupiter.
<i>- We're getting close.</i>
l deciphered some more of the glyphs.
l got a reference to an eye,
a star, and an explosion of some kind.
Cut to the chase, Chief. Do you have
the Eye of Jupiter in your hands or not?
No, Major.
That's it!
It's hot.
All right, Chief, listen to me. That's it.
Get your people to the rally point and
blow the temple. Repeat, blow the temple.
Yes, sir... Dammit.
All right, fall back! Sykes! Mathias!
Fall back! Fall back! Fall back!
All right, that's it. Everybody drop
what you're doing and get out.
- <i>(man)</i> Keep that one.
- That means you too, Cally. Come on!
- Leave the gear! Go!
- Come on.
<i>(Cally)</i> l've got it.
- If l only had a little more time.
- Galen!
It's in the hands of the gods now. Let's go,
There's nothing we can do.
The ship's structure's intact.
OK.
That means the only thing keeping
us grounded is a busted fly-by-wire, so...
you've gotta bypass those bundles
with data cord from the com system,
and then we... we may have a shot
at getting out of here.
<i>(groans)</i>
There's only one left.
Better save it
for when you fly us out of here.
l can't fly.
- Especially all whacked up on morpha.
- Well, that's just frakking great.
He won't cheat. He's too honourable.
Unlike you.
Yeah, unlike me.
l love Sam, l hate Sam.
l love Lee, l hate Lee.
The gods l have to cheat
just to keep the pieces all nice and neat.
Stay with it. You've still gotta
walk me through these avionics.
The Cylons have reached the temple.
Chief, what's your status?
l'm wiring the last detonator.
<i>(D'Anna)</i> The Eye of Jupiter has be
somewhere in this temple.
They've wired it with explosives.
Let's disconnect it.
Pull out the detonators. Quickly!
Chief, blow this thing!
Are you out of your frakkin' mind?!
l can't do it.
- Gaius!
- Yes?
Help us!
Here.
Give me that control!
This just about does it...
Frak!
What have you done?
What have you done?
Major, look.
<i>(Apollo)</i> What is that?
There it is, Gaius. It has the answers
to all of your questions.
That's the Eye?
- What is?
- Oh. Uh...
Something the hybrid said. Uh...
"Sapphire blue, shining like unto a star..."
D'Anna... You didn't come here
looking for Earth,
you came here
looking for something else.
<i>(explosion)</i>
l'm picking up a massive energy pulse.
Sir, it's a helium flash.
The star's going nova.
Novas can obliterate the entire planet
in less than an hour.
Major, look.
It's the mandala from the temple.
This is supposed to be happening.
That's it.
l was staring at it the whole time.
The sun is going nova.
The nova is the Eye of Jupiter.
All right. We can still blow it.
We can still blow it.
We just gotta make it into orbit and
<i>Galactica</i> will find us from there, OK?
This is my destiny.
To see what lies between life and death.
And to look upon
the faces of the Final Five.
That can't happen.
This is my destiny.
Sorry, D'Anna.
<i>(gunshot)</i>
The Final Five.
Is it really you?
You.
Forgive me. l had no idea.
No idea about what? What did you see?
What?
Who was it?
Oh, beautiful.
What was?
Tell me! Am l one of you?
You were right.
About what?
D'Anna, did you see my face?
l have to know. Please. Please,
stay with me. Stay! l have to know!
Tell me! l have to know!
Did you see my face?
Am l a Cylon?
Frak it.
God, tell me the truth before l die.
Welcome home, Mr President.
Admiral, the Cylon fleet just jumped away.
They don't want to be here when that
nova shock front gets here. Neither do we.
- Launch a rescue mission now.
- That nova will fry the whole system.
It's gonna be a photo finish.
- All rescue ships accounted for.
- Count us down.
- Commence FTL.
- Commencing FTL.
<i>(Gaeta)</i> Jump in three... two... one...
l got it.
- He's not dead?
- No, unfortunately.
Take him to the brig.
Sharon.
We have to get her to Doc Cottle
right away, OK?
- OK.
- <i>(guard)</i> Stick up!
Hold your fire, hold your fire.
- She helped us escape.
- Get out of the way!
Dammit.
Sharon.
l think the chief is right.
l think the nova does look like
the mandala inside this temple.
Do you think the thirteenth tribe
had a vision of what was to come?
- l don't know what else it could mean.
- They saw another nova and drew that?
- See one nova, you've seen them all.
- Well, there was another nova.
Seen 4,000 years ago, round about
when the temple might have been built.
It's 13,000 light years from here, a cloud
of gas known as the Ionian nebula.
Maybe it was a road sign...
showing the direction
that they headed to next.
So, Starbuck, is that what you gotta do
to get some actual rack time around here?
- Did you just come by to frak with me?
- l wanted to know if you had any, uh...
pictures of your old apartment on Caprica.
Um...
Yeah. Uh...
The locker. Top shelf, there's a cigar box.
- Why?
- l'm curious about something.
l hope you aren't planning
on redecorating.
You're not gonna get any bright ideas
from my old place.
Oh, l remember.
- l've seen better-Iooking train wrecks.
- Oh, thank you.
But l do remember
those paintings you did.
What about 'em?
This... was on the temple.
Where'd you get the idea to paint yours?
l don't know. It's just something
l've been doodling since l was a kid.
l liked the pattern.
Well...
They built the temple 4,000 years ago.
What is it?
It's just something Leoben said once.
That l had a destiny.
That it had already been written.
<i>(groans)</i>
You know the drill.
Long, deep, controlled breathing.
At least you'll never have to
go through this again.
The decision wasn't easy,
but the conclusion was inevitable.
Your model is fundamentally flawed.
No.
It's not a flaw
to question our purpose, is it?
To wonder who programmed us,
the way we think, and why.
That's the problem right there -
the messianic conviction that you're
on a special mission to enlighten us.
- Look at the damage it's caused.
- l would do it all again.
Yes, we know. That's why
we've decided to... box your entire line.
Your consciousness, memory,
every thought your model ever had,
- going into cold storage, indefinitely.
- One must die to know the truth.
There are five other Cylons, Brother.
l saw them.
One day you're going to see them too.
One day...
Goodbye.
Brother...
Brother...
Brother.
- l've got it.
- <i>(whistles)</i>
Make it stop!
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>
Oh, no, look, l'm sorry,
l can't live like this.
So l won't divorce and you won't cheat.
- So where does that leave us?
- Trapped.
What's this?
The summary executions of all
the detainees listed on the next page.
It needs your signature.
<i>(Gaeta)</i> This is a death warrant.
Have you seen the names on this list?
<i>Do you have any idea</i>
<i>what they're about to do out there?</i>
<i>(gunfire)</i>
<i>(Number Six)</i> If you are a Cylon, these
feelings are part of your programming.
The final five revealed only to those who
enter the temple, only to the Chosen One.
Her destiny will part company from yours.
She's not the Chosen One, you are.
Dear God, tell me the truth before l die.
Am l a Cylon?
Welcome home, Mr President.
<i>(Baltar and Number Six sing lullaby)</i>
Sorry. Improvising.
You're doing the right thing, Gaius.
- Gaius...
- What?
Yes.
Yes.
Wake up!
<i>(both sing lullaby)</i>
Wait.
Wait a minute.
l need some time to think this through.
Too late, Gaius.
It's time to learn the truth.
- Sergeant.
- Sorry, sir.
No one can speak to the prisoner
without presidential authorisation.
- l already have authorisation.
- Step back, sir.
That's it, Gaius.
Deep breaths.
Deep breaths.
That's it, Gaius.
Deep breaths.
Deep breaths.
The first time's the hardest.
You're doing wonderfully.
l'm alive.
l'm alive.
Thank God! l'm alive!
l always told you to have faith.
Then no one was betrayed.
l was never one of them.
l <i>am</i> one of you.
Is that what you think, Gaius?
l knew it. l knew it.
l always knew l was different.
Special.
Maybe a little gifted.
Ow! That's a bit rough, actually.
That hurt.
- What's wrong?
- <i>You're</i> wrong, Gaius.
You're not Cylon, you're human.
And you're dead!
He's alive.
l'll get Cottle.
l'm just saying,
you're gonna be surprised.
- Yeah, well, Major...
- Right this way.
"Joe's"?
Well, l think l've seen a bar before.
<i>(laid-back music plays)</i>
- You've got to be frakking kidding me.
- Come on.
OK, this way.
Hey, Joe!
Chief Tyrol. Welcome.
Any friend of the major's a friend of mine,
which means you get the good stuff.
Thank you very much, don't mind if l do.
Not going home tonight, so...
Why, did you and Cally have a fight?
You didn't hear us?
l figured we could've sold tickets.
Uh...
To marriage: why we build bars.
Yeah.
Joe!
<i>(Cottle)</i> l warned about
the dangers of sleep deprivation.
Psychosis can make a man
do strange things.
And Baltar's little hunger strike
is not helping, either.
Bastard wants to die that bad,
l say let him.
Bottom line, we need Baltar to talk.
If the other Cylons saw
the same symbols that we saw,
they could be on their way to Earth
and setting up an ambush by now.
l bet after tonight
he'll be more willing.
Doc, wait an hour or two.
l want him cogent.
l also don't want him to starve.
- What do you expect me to do about it?
- l expect you to make sure he eats.
<i>(clears throat)</i>
l'll see about putting
security cameras in that cell.
Um, Mr Gaeta...
What exactly were you doing going to see
Dr Baltar in the middle of the night?
Um...
l couldn't sleep and l guess l thought
he might be willing to talk to me.
We understand.
Just leave his interrogation to us.
Of course.
You're up late.
- You know, the Chief says hi.
- He one of your new drinking buddies?
l would invite you, but you made it
very clear it's not your thing.
No, it's your thing,
and that's not what l was asking.
l got a briefing at 0500.
- Are we still on for dinner tomorrow?
- <i>(sighs)</i> Yeah.
- l already switched watches.
- Sure.
Just be nice for a husband and wife
to occasionally...
Forget it.
<i>(Roslin)</i> Thank you.
You can leave the door open.
Hi.
Touché, Madam President.
l have no wish to see you suffer.
Really?
l've just had the pleasure of having a tube
forced up my nose and down my throat.
Everybody's got to eat.
It's for your own good.
And it's nothing compared to what
many of our people were subjected to
in your jail cells on New Caprica.
Not my jails... the Cylons'.
It's an academic distinction
at this point, Doctor.
None of us are enjoying this, so why
don't you just tell me what l need to know
and your suffering will come to an end,
and l promise you this.
l know nothing about the Cylon plans
or their whereabouts.
l witnessed nothing in that temple.
My information on Cylon intelligence is...
is limited, to say the least.
Prior to the attack, did you have
high-level security clearance?
- Yes. So what?
- Did you tell anybody about it?
Did you let someone
into the defence mainframe?
- Careful, Gaius.
- The blonde woman l saw you with
on Caprica, just prior to the attack?
She'll flush you out of an airlock
without a moment's hesitation.
Unless, of course,
that prospect no longer frightens you.
<i>(exhales)</i>
Lies.
All lies.
A rehash of all the other old lies.
l did not collude
in the genocide of my own people.
Devlin and Maryanne McAIlister
and their son and daughter.
A family of four gunned down
in their own home
- on suspicion of insurgency.
- l am not responsible.
l just wondered if you recognised
even one of these faces.
Did any image get through to you on the
rare occasion when you ventured out...
- l am not responsible...
- ...from behind your sandbags to see...
- <i>...any</i> more than l am for the genocide.
- ...what was happening to your people?
<i>Your</i> people! l need to know, now.
Colonel Tigh, get in here!
Get this man out of here.
This is not about uncovering a threat.
- Toss him out of the nearest airlock.
- This is about your pound of flesh!
- Get in here! Get rid of him!
- What about my fair trial?
- Take him out of here.
- Get your frakking hands off me!
l demand a fair trial! l am a citizen
of the Colonies and l demand a fair trial!
A fair trial!
Take a good look. Just a fraction
of the people you sent to their deaths.
Rather fitting they should see
you take your last breaths.
Stop! Stop, wait!
- Stop!
- What? What?
You asked if l know these people.
l know that man.
Show me, show me!
Let him go, let him go!
- Keep your guns on him!
- This man.
His name was Adrien Bauer,
my lab assistant on Caprica.
- So what?
- He was Gemonese. l got him a visa.
l introduced him to his wife.
l am godfather to their first child.
l wouldn't harm this man or his family.
Or anybody's family! l am not a murderer!
l am innocent! Why won't you believe me?
- Get him! Take him out of here!
- Is this what you call Colonial justice?
What did l ever do for you, huh?
Only save your bleeding life! Argh!
You gave it your best shot.
l understand.
Yeah, the bastard still wouldn't talk.
Either he's got more stones
than l gave him credit for, or...
Or he knew you were bluffing.
Well...
what do we do with him now?
There is one thing.
Admiral?
The military once ran an experimental
interrogation programme involving drugs.
Hallucinogens, specifically.
The goal of the programme was
to create a state of anxiety so intense
that the subject believed
that their very survival was at stake.
The interrogators exploit that,
become less an adversary and more
a lifeline - at least, that was the idea.
It might get Baltar to talk,
tell us what the Cylons know about Earth.
But it's dangerous, especially
for someone in Baltar's condition.
Are you telling me we have these drugs
aboard <i>Galactica?</i>
You're being awfully accommodating.
Is that how it looks to you?
Your estranged two-timing bitch of a wife
calls you up for a quickie
and you hop on the first shuttle?
l'd say yeah.
- l've been thinking about stuff, Kara.
- Yeah, like what?
Like...
what that crazy skin-job Leoben said
about you and your "special destiny".
What if there's something to that?
Kara Thrace and her special destiny?
That sounds more like
a bad cover band, Sam.
Think about it, though.
Why did l survive all those months
on Caprica, waiting for you to return,
if l was just gonna walk out on you?
And you... l mean,
did you go through that hell
locked in that fake house
with that fake husband
just so you could ditch me?
l don't think so.
Not when l think about it like that.
Do you love him?
What?
Lee, Kara. Do you love Lee?
Gods, Sam, I...
Maybe.
l don't know.
Then you gotta go to him.
- l thought you were off duty.
- l am, yeah.
l was just gonna
stop by the bar for a little while.
If you're gonna see Kara, just admit it.
- l told you, there's nothing going on.
- Yeah, you both told me.
"Lee won't cheat, he's too noble."
The problem is, it's all a crock.
You know what the only problem is?
That you don't trust me, that's it.
And this is just your own frakking
insecurities talking, same as always.
l mean, right from the get-go.
The very first morning that l proposed.
l mean... You know what? Forget it.
This is frakking pointless.
Maybe you're right.
l did see this coming.
And l was naive enough
to marry you anyway.
And you wanna know why, Lee?
Cos l loved you.
l loved you so frakking much.
l thought l was lucky.
That's right - lucky.
That l could have you for just as long
as you - or Kara - would let me.
Dee...
- Come on, come here.
- <i>(sobs)</i>
It's not a marriage, Lee.
This is a lie.
You wanna be with Kara?
Go ahead.
l won't stand in your way.
It's over.
Wait, where are you going?
<i>(door closes)</i>
No, Sam.
l gotta get going.
This was fun.
<i>(Anders)</i> l love you.
<i>(Baltar)</i> l'm a human being.
l'm a human being, l have rights.
l said, l have rights!
Please. Please help me.
l'm not sure l can, Gaius.
Pain is one thing, but this...
Without free will, what are you?
Can God even pity such a creature?
Why not just admit you're doing this
for your own satisfaction.
That's the truth.
Why not put the needle in yourself?
- <i>(Cottle)</i> Hold his head.
- Oh, no, no, no!
No! No! Oh, God!
He's under.
Try not to make any loud noise.
Put the head strap on.
Where am I?
My God, where am I?
<i>(Apollo)</i> What are you saying?
If l leave Sam, will you still leave Dee?
My gods, Kara.
How do l know that tomorrow
you're not gonna pull another 180?
These are our frakking marriages.
It's not some stupid dogfight
we can just jink our way out of.
Think about it, Lee.
It's what you're best at.
Where am I?
My God, where am I?
<i>(Adama) Can you hear my voice?</i>
<i>Can you hear me, Doctor?</i>
- Admiral, is that you?
- <i>l'm looking for you, Doctor.</i>
But l can't find you.
Can you tell us where you are?
It's water.
l'm in the water.
It's cold and it's dark.
l can't see anything!
Is there anything you can see
that can tell us where you are?
<i>Look for the light.</i>
<i>Can you see it?</i>
- Yes.
- <i>Try to reach for the light.</i>
<i>(monitor bleeps rapidly then slows)</i>
That's it.
That's it.
- Yes.
- Follow the light.
<i>(thunder)</i>
<i>(explosion)</i>
Caprica.
Caprica Six!
She saved my life.
She shielded me from the explosion.
Doctor, did you conspire with her
to subvert our defence system?
Conspiracy requires intent.
l never intended...
But she said deep down
l'd always suspected.
But l didn't know.
How could l know?
Did l conspire? Did I?
No!
No! l don't know.
No.
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't my fault!
l am not responsible!
<i>(monitor bleeps rapidly)</i>
She...
Caprica Six.
She chose me.
She chose me over all men.
Chosen to be seduced.
Taken by the hand.
Guided between the light and the dark.
<i>But is she an angel or is she a demon?</i>
<i>ls she imaginary or is she real?</i>
Is she my own voice or the voice of?
l can't stay afloat much longer!
Now give us details, Doctor.
Give us details about the Cylons,
or we'll let you drown.
Alone... in the dark.
No!
Hey, Chief.
Why is it so frakking hard?
Why can't we just... get back to normal?
Normal...
What is "normal", anyway?
Chief, you can tell me
if l'm out of line here,
but, um...
Do you ever think about Sharon?
No.
Come on.
You never wonder, "What if..."?
No.
No, don't leave me!
l know l'm flawed!
l never claimed to be...
Yeah, mistakes... mistakes were made,
terrible mistakes!
Were they mine?
Am l solely to blame?
l was a player, that's all! l was a player!
l was struggling to try
to find my place in God's plan!
God's resolve. I...
l never intended for certain things
to happen! Doesn't that matter?
You took the Cylons to the temple,
to the Eye of Jupiter. What did it tell them?
What did it tell them about Earth?
l was looking for...
What were you looking for, Doctor?
What were you looking for?
<i>(spiritual chanting)</i>
Their faces,
but they wouldn't show them to me.
Their faces. Whose faces?
The five.
The final five.
The final five? Cylons?
l thought l might be one of them.
l told them l wanted to be one of them.
A Cylon? Why?
All my sins forgiven.
A new beginning.
Are you a Cylon, Dr Baltar?
No.
That's not good enough, Doctor.
Tell me what you told the Cylons.
What do they know?
Tell me, or l'll have to let you go, Doctor.
<i>l'll have to let you go.</i>
<i>Tell me, or l'll have to let you go.</i>
<i>l'll have to let you go.</i>
Look where you're going.
My ring.
Has anybody seen my ring?
l lost it.
Has anybody seen my ring?
l want my ring!
- Admiral, we're losing him.
- <i>(rapid bleeps)</i>
That's enough. l'm putting an end
to this freak show right now.
<i>(Roslin)</i> No, listen to this.
Five final Cylon models.
Five pillars of the temple
for the five priests devoted
to the one whose name cannot be spoken.
- Come on, it's all just mumbo jumbo.
- He's holding a lot back, l'm sure of it.
Maybe we should resort
to more direct methods.
Direct methods?
Now you have my vote.
No.
We tried the stick -
it's time to try the carrot.
The thing he's most deeply afraid of
is, even if he talks, we'll kill him.
- Smart man.
- We have to ease his fear,
make him believe that if he collaborates,
at the very least he'll have his life.
He won't buy that, coming from us.
Of course not.
We have to find someone he trusts.
<i>(Baltar)</i> As perverse as it may seem,
l may actually owe these people
a debt of gratitude.
l realise there's probably nothing l can say
that can make this right.
But there's something you need to know.
l asked you to marry me
because l was in love with you.
Just like l'm in love with you now.
They forced me...
to admit my failings.
<i>And now that l have,</i>
<i>l feel positively liberated.</i>
You were right.
l loved Kara.
You know? And maybe
there's part of me that always will.
In my heart,
l know l have always done...
what l've had to do.
But l married you.
l married you.
And, you know,
when l look back at our marriage,
at the time that we have spent together,
you are good for me, Dee.
And l need you.
And l don't think l ever really realised that
till l knew that l was losing you.
<i>(Gaeta)</i> l can't promise you a trial, Doctor.
l'm sure that if you give them
something... anything...
But, please, just give me another chance -
that's all l'm asking.
Just give me the chance.
<i>(Gaeta) These charts that l've been using</i>
<i>to plot our course to Earth...</i>
<i>l've never been confident</i>
<i>of my calculations.</i>
That's lucky, because
the calculations are wrong.
l detect a number of inconsistencies
right off the bat.
- These figures here are wrong.
- That's exactly what l was afraid of.
Cylon navigation systems
are far more advanced than ours.
But l have managed to commit
many of the algorithms to memory.
If we can offer them this kind of help,
l'm certain, at the very least,
they'll spare your life.
Maybe we can even get you out of this cell
and offer you some proper quarters.
Creature comforts, that's the clincher?
Sorry?
Where is it?
- Um... where is what, Doctor?
- "Where is what?"
So much for that little stratagem.
<i>Hello.</i>
You all right?
Listen, we don't have to stay here
if you don't want to, OK?
Yeah.
Two whiskies, straight up.
l should have known that you'd betray me.
What did you tell them?
You stayed behind till the grisly end
on New Caprica so you could, what,
so you could feed information
to the Resistance?
Who do you think allowed you to do that?
- That's a lie.
- No, it's not a lie. You think l'm blind?
You see, l literally had a gun
pointed to my head.
But nobody forced you to play both sides.
So l'm asking you, Mr Gaeta...
who is the real traitor in this room?
To the first of many.
- Let's do another.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
- l'm not a traitor.
- Of course.
<i>Because there are far worse things</i>
<i>than being a traitor, aren't there, Felix?</i>
If your friends only knew the truth.
Don't worry. l can keep your little secret.
We gotta get in there.
Frak you!
<i>(guard)</i> Lieutenant Gaeta,
step away from the prisoner, now!
Step away from the prisoner.
l will not ask again.
- Stand down, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
- Step back, Mr Gaeta.
- No! No, sir.
l can't let him live,
not after what he's done.
Mr Gaeta? Mr Gaeta, wait, please.
Look at me.
- l understand what you're feeling.
- No, you don't.
Yes, l do. The other night, you didn't
come here to interrogate Dr Baltar.
You came here to kill him, didn't you?
l understand that, l do.
- What's his condition?
- He missed the artery. He'll live.
Gotta get him to sickbay.
Get a gurney in here right away.
<i>(Roslin)</i> Go easy on him.
<i>(Number Six)</i> All things considered, Gaius,
it could have been worse.
Much worse.
Well, you're not one of the five,
but you certainly have
the luck of the gods.
Well, l <i>am</i> the Chosen One.
You didn't tell them that, did you?
No.
Everybody's got to have a secret.
l told him l didn't take any satisfaction
in seeing his pain.
But the truth is, l was willing to see him
endure a great deal of suffering
in order to get what l wanted.
It wasn't some intelligence or some truth.
l wanted a genuine admission of guilt.
That's something you're not gonna get
from someone like Baltar.
He doesn't see himself that way.
It's not who he is.
In his eyes... he's the victim.
Not the criminal.
It's not too late for him
to just... disappear.
We can't do that.
For all his crimes, he's one of us.
So what happens next?
We give him his trial.
Back masking.
Turn me on, dead man.
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>
- We all made sacrifices.
- Is that so?
Yes, that's right.
Then how come some Cylon lover
is holding down my post?
Hera's alive. l'm her mother and l'm going
to get her. l'm begging you to do this.
<i>(yells)</i>
You've put the entire fleet in jeopardy.
Are you aware of that?
l'm not a traitor. l did what l thought
was right. She'll get Hera.
Let's go.
- No! Hold your fire!
- Get out of the way!
Throw that thing in the brig.
l demand my rights as a Colonial citizen to
legal representation and full due process.
Do you?
- So what happens next?
- We give him his trial.
They think they can squeeze these
into the starboard hangar?
That's why Helo's down here.
To manage the civilian refugees.
l've got the breakdown on the
<i>Thera Sita's</i> inhabitants coming aboard.
51 Sagittarons.
- Oh, boy.
- Helo may be overmatched down there.
Pretty rough night last night, huh?
Hey. l said you didn't sleep so well.
Oh, stupid dream. Whatever.
- So, you're OK?
- Yeah.
They're about to increase
the population down there by 300.
l don't know where l'll put 'em, but l'm
not walking around taking my own pulse.
- l'm fine.
- <i>(Apollo)</i> There he is.
- If it isn't the mayor of Dogsville.
- Cut him some slack.
Hear you got another shipload
of loyal subjects.
Helo, come here. l need a favour.
l have a date tonight with this ripped-
and-ready nugget that l want to break in.
Think you can wrangle me up
one of those sexy cubicles?
- Yeah, yeah.
- <i>(Apollo)</i> See you around, Helo.
Yeah. You guys
know where to find me.
- You're gonna check up on Hera, right?
- Yes. Babe, l'm gonna check up on Hera.
- Love you.
- Love you too.
l need you to keep moving.
You need to keep moving.
l know, l know. We'll deal
with your concerns. Keep moving.
Welcome aboard <i>Galactica.</i>
My name is Captain Karl Agathon.
l've been assigned
to look after your personal welfare.
- Where are you putting the Sagittarons?
- Arrangements haven't been made yet.
- We want to be with our own!
- You heard. Get your ass in motion! Move!
l got things under control here, Colonel.
Yeah. Sure you do.
Excuse me.
Could l have a brief look at your son?
No, no, no.
We're fine. We don't need a doctor.
l know.
We don't need a doctor. We're Sagittaron.
We don't believe in medicine.
It's all right. This is Dr Robert.
He's our civilian doctor.
He has nothing to do with the military.
We'll respect your traditions.
You can trust me. l'm Sagittaron.
It's OK.
It's OK.
OK? Can l feel that?
Would you open your mouth for me?
Open wide.
All right.
Look at this.
- Do you feel anything? How about here?
- <i>(groans)</i>
- <i>(mother)</i> That's enough.
- Get your hands off me!
That's enough. That's enough.
Thank you.
- Sir.
- Hey, keep your hands to yourself.
- OK.
- All right?
<i>(coughing)</i>
Mike. You braindead card cheat.
You still owe me that drink.
- Saul, get out of here. Now.
- Well, you're in a good mood today.
Hey, Doc. Some of these people,
they look, um...
- Sick.
- Sick, yeah.
<i>(Dualla)</i> Medic!
- Dr Robert!
- Leave, Saul.
- Get your hands off my son! No!
- <i>(Robert)</i> Got him. Got him.
- Where are they taking him?
- It's all right, ma'am. Just walk this way.
<i>(coughing)</i>
- So, what have we got here, Mike?
- Mellorak sickness.
It originates in the kidneys then attacks
the respiratory and the immune system.
It's a nasty bit of business.
If you don't treat the first symptoms in 48
hours, it will kill you in three to five days.
- How contagious is it?
- It's not airborne, so we lucked out there.
It's spread through human contact. Saliva,
sexual intercourse, through the skin...
Right now, it seems
confined to the Sagittarons.
That's good.
They're welcome to it.
It's spreading down there,
where we were working.
- It's curable?
- <i>(Cottle)</i> Absolutely.
A shot of bittamusin
and you're right as rain in a day or two.
And sedatives alleviate the symptoms.
l don't know how long
our stock will hold out,
so we should conserve it and only
inoculate after the first symptoms show.
<i>(Adama)</i> This is a civilian infection,
so it's in your hands.
But l want Tyrol and the crew
immunised before they get sick.
If we disinfect everything and stress
hygiene, some people won't get sick.
And they won't need the medicine.
Shouldn't we get everyone in
the showers? Especially the Sagittarons.
- We should make an announcement.
- No, we don't want to...
single them out more than we have to -
we'll have a riot on our hands.
If it were up to me, l would say
just get the Sagittarons settled,
and then deal with the civvies
that have already arrived.
You won't have to worry about having
enough medicine for the Sagittarons.
Yeah. Most of them are gonna refuse it.
People are gonna die.
For the last 3,000 years,
medicine's been the great curse.
They're a bunch of
stubborn root-sucking jackasses
holding on to traditions
that are a thousand years old.
<i>(chanting)</i>
Drink this.
Stink enough for you in here?
- Yeah, it's a really potent smell.
- Yeah.
That's burdock root.
The Sagittarons use it as a calmative.
- Does it work?
- Hell, l don't know.
They're all gonna die anyway.
<i>(Zarek) Tell me there won't be a trial.</i>
Gaius Baltar will be tried
for high crimes and treason.
A tribunal of judges will hear the evidence
against him. A verdict will be read.
He will be found guilty and he will be
finally held responsible for his actions.
If you can summon up a little patience,
as l have done,
we will get through this ordeal.
Listen to me.
Baltar will get his trial.
And this is what you'll get -
a hurricane.
The media will descend on you
and watch and question your every move.
You will have sectarian violence,
assassination attempts.
You will have civil unrest
on a scale we've never seen.
Work, labour, everyday routine in this fleet
will come to a complete halt.
This trial is going to
bring this entire fleet down.
Mr Vice President,
we have a security plan in order,
which includes rapid marine deployment,
increased CAP operations, security...
A hurricane, Laura.
If l were you,
l'd declare martial law during the trial.
You're going to need a lot more
than a little patience to survive.
l'm here if you need me.
Your best friend's your worst enemy.
l've never seen him like that.
He was truly frightened.
<i>We</i> are not sick. Sags brought
the sickness with them. Send them back!
- Where do you suggest l send them?
- l don't know. Figure it out.
OK. Your concerns have been noted.
We're gonna do the best we can.
Yes. Can l help you?
My son is dead.
l'm sorry.
It's a soma braid, right?
You Sagittarons believe
it's supposed to bring good health?
Look, l'm sorry. It's not enough. If you
don't treat the disease, it's fatal, OK?
- This didn't have to happen.
- Yes, it did.
He was killed.
No. Ma'am, he died. OK? He died
because he needed real medicine.
He died because l made a mistake.
OK.
OK. Good. Yeah.
Then, please, tell the others.
l will.
l will tell them not to trust him.
They warned me about him,
but l wouldn't listen.
l didn't want my son to die.
l took a chance. l went to Dr Robert.
l let the doctor
give the medicine to Willie.
Ma'am... you waited too long.
Willie had been sick
for less than 12 hours.
He was 19. He is dead.
That doctor killed my son.
<i>(sobs)</i>
- We lost another one last night.
- Yeah. Willie King.
No. A three-year-old girl
whose parents refused to let me treat her.
Willie King's mother lost Willie King.
It's a shame. The boy was a goner.
You saw him when he came in here.
He was at least three days symptomatic.
You explained this to the mother?
Yes, of course l did. What the hell
am l supposed to say to her?
"If you would have just turned the corner
sooner on this superstitious crap,
we could have saved your son"?
Get your shirt off, would you?
- Excuse me?
- l'm gonna vaccinate you.
l'm not sick. We're rationing.
Think l'm gonna wait
until you're on your back for a day?
Who else is gonna help me here?
OK. OK.
Oh, l talked to, uh, Tigh.
He was asking about you.
l told him you were doing a hell of a job.
l wouldn't wish this place on anybody.
- Come on. You ready?
- Yeah.
This might sting a bit.
You're done.
No!
Yeah!
All right, Hands of Stone.
Let me see what you've got.
Put it in the hole, Marge.
Want to know my secret, Connor?
l pretend this thing is your face.
Hey. It's Mellorak Man. Everybody run.
Relax. The doc dosed me.
l hear it's pretty rough down there, huh?
Only if you're a Sagittaron.
Dying, you know?
It just... it seems so senseless.
Yeah, well,
you'll get no tears from me.
Bad enough my gang's gotta
sweat through their stench.
One of these days, l'm gonna be
really pissed cos we're out of meds
cos those Sags saw the light
and we had to share.
You gonna babble or shoot?
Yeah!
None of those religious freaks
lifted a finger down on New Caprica.
- Chief, knock it off.
- A lot of good people lost their lives.
l said knock it off, all right?
Oh.
- Sorry, Dee.
- It's all right.
l have more of a reason to be mad at them
than you do. l am Sagittaron.
Most of them are paranoid,
pig-headed and argumentative.
They're sure making it miserable
for Dr Robert.
Medicine's an abomination.
It's a sin against the gods.
Physicians spread disease
cos they refuse to acknowledge
that the body
and the mind are myths.
This body is no myth.
- If l get sick, l'm gonna see Dr Robert.
- <i>(Apollo)</i> You're not getting sick.
Anyone but Cottle.
Near-sighted bastard.
He might as well use a spike
instead of a needle.
So they're treating you well, then?
Yeah. Well enough.
They take a while to get to the point,
though, don't they?
Look, Six...
l wanna thank you
for what you did.
l'm still not sure
why you did it, though.
Exactly.
What are we doing here?
How could you possibly throw yourself
on the mercy of these people?
- <i>(Sharon)</i> And now you're here.
- Yeah.
Your best chance of survival
is to work with them.
And that means to help them
expose Baltar for his crimes.
Look, l gotta go. So, um...
l'm gonna look into
some clothes for you.
Please, take care of yourself.
Hey.
Thank you for the visit.
<i>To have some company...</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>(Sharon) No. l care about you.</i>
<i>(Baltar)</i> Do you think
any of them care about you?
l imagine they don't.
So, what are you doing here again?
- l'm still trying to figure that out.
- So you're here to save them, are you?
l told you, l don't know.
You're here...
because you want to be human.
But there's a trick to being human.
You have to think
only about yourself.
- <i>(Roslin)</i> What do you think she's doing?
- l don't know.
She's talking to something or someone.
l don't know. l've seen her do it before.
<i>(shouting)</i>
<i>(man)</i> We can't let him do it!
He's a murderer!
- <i>(guard)</i> Stay back!
- <i>(man #2)</i> Get him!
<i>(guard)</i> Stay back!
Everybody back! Step away from him!
Everybody back!
Get off him! Now!
Move back, people!
Move back! Back away, now!
- He killed my father!
- l tried to help him, you ignorant fool!
- Get off me!
- OK. Get behind me.
So you immunised the old man,
but he still died.
What made him and his father change
their mind about getting immunised?
Who said they changed their mind?
l administered the bittamusin on my own.
Without their consent?
It was the middle of the night.
The old man was screaming in pain.
l mean, what was l supposed to do?
OK, I... l don't understand. Aren't we
rationing? It was well after the 48 hours.
Yeah, that's right.
But it's not exact.
Everybody's different.
OK, he was marginal.
Look. l'm not gonna sit here
and apologise to you for doing my job.
l've got two Picons
that are starting to show symptoms.
Now, l'm gonna go treat them,
if it's all right with you.
The doctor's version of when he gave
the drug greatly differed from Mrs King's.
Who?
The woman. King.
The one l told you about - Mrs King.
Her son showed symptoms. She took him
for treatment. The boy still died.
And Robert treated a Sagittaron
without the man's consent.
We should have done that in the first
place. The disease would have been gone.
The only reason we didn't is we're
respecting the customs of the Sagittarons.
But he didn't respect them. Sir, people
could be dying under Robert's care.
People die under my care every day.
It goes with the damn job.
- Killing doesn't.
- Killing?
You are way out of line.
Mike Robert deserves better than this.
Even if he isn't treating
some of these people unethically,
l'm concerned he's created
a situation down there. It's bad.
Captain...
l have the former president
of the Colonies sitting in a prison cell,
a Cylon woman is in custody,
and a population that would jump
at the chance to tear both of them apart.
My ship is overcrowded,
and l have an epidemic on my hands.
Now, the question is,
are you capable
of doing your job?
And are you gonna stop making
these unfounded accusations?
Are you?
- Yes, sir.
- Dismissed.
<i>(grunts)</i>
<i>(Tigh)</i> Agathon!
Why don't you knock it off, Helo?
Get your teeth out of the doc's ass.
- It's not doing you any good.
- With all due respect... sir,
l think Robert might be hurting people.
He is the only one to say anything good
about you in as long as l can remember.
You may as well take whatever credibility
you have left and chuck it out an airlock.
You want to stand up for these crazy
frakking people? What is it with you?
You just like being on the outside
looking in, don't you?
l don't know what you mean by that, sir.
Unless you're referring to my wife. Again.
Mike Robert is a stand-up guy.
A Caprican. One of our own.
A man l can trust. On New Caprica,
he worked with the Resistance.
He patched up my eye.
He fought the enemy.
While you were snuggled up in bed
with your Cylon wife every night.
Colonel!
You OK?
<i>(Tigh groans)</i>
So. You do give a frak
what your friends think.
Good for you.
That's how it should be.
But you know what? l give a frak, too.
About friends, about loyalty.
You keep soiling Mike Robert's
good name, and we are gonna finish this.
How does that sound to you?
You'd better have the doctor
look at that hand.
<i>(Helo)</i> Sorry,
you're gonna have to wait.
Excuse me. 15 minutes, people.
l'll be back in 15 minutes.
l'm sorry.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Sir, get your hands off me.
- Sharon.
- Helo.
- What's going on?
- How's Hera?
What do you mean?
She got sick about an hour ago.
They pulled me off CAP.
- What? No one told me.
- They sent her to Dr Robert.
I... l don't know if she needs this.
This is serious.
She could die from this.
Here we go. Here we go.
It's all right. Look at this.
Here. Here's your toy.
Good girl. Good girl.
Now, these are sedatives in pill form. Give
her a half every six hours. Just crush it up.
- OK. She'll be OK, though?
- She'll be fine. You can take her home.
- Thank you, Doctor.
- OK. Bye-bye.
- All right. Bye-bye.
- <i>(Sharon)</i> Say bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
She'll be fine.
All right?
OK.
Oh. Uh, listen.
Would you give this to Mrs King?
This is... uh... It belonged to her son.
l know she would want it back.
All right?
Hi.
Dr Robert gave me this
to give to you.
He gave you this? Huh.
How is your daughter?
- She's fine, thanks.
- Good.
Mrs King? Please.
l need to ask you something.
If you thought Dr Robert was dangerous,
why let him treat your son?
You said you were warned.
l couldn't believe anyone
could have that much hate in them.
- But you understand how...
- l'm through talking.
Talking isn't gonna bring Willie back.
l think you should leave now.
Mrs King, I...
l'm sorry.
You seem angry.
l'm not. l'm just...
Work.
It's OK that you hate your job.
It's OK... it's OK to admit it, too.
It's not the job. l know the job sucks.
l don't need to be reminded of it.
OK.
- Then what is it?
- Look.
It's what l see every day. OK?
It's hard to not see it.
See what?
- Talk to me, Karl.
- l don't know, l keep doing it.
l keep doing it. l keep ending up
on the wrong side of everything.
You know, maybe Tigh's right.
Maybe l want it that way.
What if l'm flying a desk
not because l'm good at it,
but because it's the right punishment
for the guy who crosses the line?
Maybe l belong in Dogsville.
So you're saying...
- Just leave it.
- What does that mean, "Just leave it"?
It means it's your job to manage these
people, Helo, and you've just gotta do it.
Yeah. You... you know what?
You're right. It's me.
It's all in my frakking head.
l didn't say that.
- Where are you going?
- l don't know.
<i>(sighs)</i>
Doc?
You ought to try a bed, Helo.
You'll get more sleep that way.
He's killing them. It's right here.
Get your ass outta here right now,
before l have the old man lock you up.
No, listen to me. He killed them.
On New Caprica.
Look.
Guy goes in for a cough,
dies of heart failure.
Here. See for yourself.
This one.
Woman had appendicitis,
died on the operating table.
Of the Picons he treated,
12% of them died.
Capricans. Oh, he likes Capricans.
The mortality rate was 6°/Ş.
Sagittarons? 90°/Ş.
- 90% of the Sagittarons died...
- l'm not going to listen to this.
- That man has his hands full down there.
- He's singling out Sagittarons.
- That doesn't bother you?
- What?
- That doesn't bother you?
- What is he doing?
- l don't know. l'm not a doctor.
- The first sensible thing you've said.
Listen. l don't think he's giving them
the medicine. He's doing something.
You're not gonna let it go, are you?
Please. Can you do an autopsy
on Mrs King's son to see how he died?
l'll let it go. l will. l promise.
l will let it go. Just check.
l did. l checked King's son.
Mellorak sickness.
He had bittamusin in his system.
All right? Now, that's it.
Now, you just leave it.
And get outta here!
Hey, Doc?
l don't really feel so good.
Think l could get
some of that bittamusin?
<i>(banging on door)</i>
<i>(Sharon whispers)</i> Who is it?
Hey, Hera. It's OK.
- Mrs King?
- Your friend, the soldier... Dualla?
She's sick.
She went to the doctor. She went...
- Slow down. What?
- You listen to me.
We lost two more tonight. Sagittarons
who let that murderer treat them.
- You have to do something.
- Excuse me. What is she doing here?
- There she is!
- You're not supposed to be here.
Let's go. Now.
Sorry, Captain. Frakking refugees.
l don't know how she snuck through.
Morning, sir.
Don't. Don't even think it.
Sharon, it's Dualla.
Dualla went down there.
- She has a husband.
- Yeah, and he's out flying CAP.
She'll be fine.
She'll take her meds. She'll be fine.
You know what's all over the ship?
You and the Sagittarons.
How you might actually
be listening to them.
That's my job.
They die because
they refuse medication.
You want me to look the other way,
is that it?
- Hera's OK. That's all that matters?
- No!
Or is it because as long as everyone hates
Sagittarons, they forget you're a Cylon?
You shut the frak up.
Yeah, look the other way. l have to fight
every day on this ship to be accepted.
This is nothing to do with you.
OK?
You think that's who l am?
That's my defining characteristic?
The guy married to a Cylon?
This guy's dirty. l think he's killing people
because he's a racist son of a bitch.
Make a hole! Get out of the way!
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Dee. Dee.
Dualla?
Dualla?
No. No, no, no, no, no, no!
Dualla. Hey!
Oh, hey.
What are you doing down here?
Dr Robert.
He gave me something.
It kicked the frak out of me.
- Where's Lee?
- We're gonna go see him. Come on.
l'm gonna take you to Cottle.
- No.
- Yeah.
- l'm Hands of Stone.
- l know. l know. Come on.
- What are you doing?
- She's coming with me.
- She's in no condition to go anywhere.
- l'm taking her to Cottle just to be sure.
What do you mean?
Get the hell outta here!
Get the frak out of my way, Doctor! Now!
- Come on, Dee. Come on.
- No.
Security!
Agathon. He's lost it.
He's hurting one of my patients.
- l'm taking her to Cottle.
- Get the XO.
Leave me alone. No. Not Cottle.
Please just leave me alone!
- Captain. What's going on, sir?
- Leave me alone.
- Captain!
- l wanna sleep.
- No, no, Dee.
- <i>(guard)</i> She doesn't want to go.
- Sir! She says she doesn't want to go!
- Get your hand off me, Sergeant!
Get your gun outta my face!
- Get your gun outta my face, Sergeant!
- Cool it!
l don't know who you're trying to impress,
but it seriously is not working.
You're killing them.
l know you're doing it.
- Stand down!
- Saul.
- You didn't tell me he was dangerous!
- Shut the frak up!
How is she?
She's been sedated.
But she's OK.
You don't believe him, do you?
He's seriously delusional. He needs help.
Yeah. And we should have
given it to him.
Doc?
l didn't check Willie's blood
until a couple of hours ago.
l was exhausted, and l'll admit
the Sagittarons annoy the hell out of me.
l didn't want to go against my colleague.
But you were right. There was
no bittamusin in the King boy's body.
- He died because it was too late.
- No, he didn't.
He died of acute cell destruction. He was
injected with a toxic bisphosphonate.
You got a wrong reading.
l don't know what else...
No! The old man, Mr Buckminster,
died of the same thing.
- There was no bittamusin in his system.
- You killed them, you sick frak.
You ought to be on your knees thanking
me for saving your daughter's life.
For having the meds
to cure her of her illness.
You know how painful
this disease is at the end.
And they don't want our help. Now, why
waste time and meds and space on them
when all of those resources
could go to those who really deserve it?
Who gets the medication
when there's not enough?
A Sagittaron who won't even raise a finger
to defend his own race, or a Viper pilot?
What the hell happened
to "Do no harm", Doctor?
l intervened because
someone has to make the tough choices.
But it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter. Look at them.
They're gonna destroy themselves
anyway. l mean, look at them.
They're like worms
crawling on a hot rock.
Remember what you used to say, Saul?
Aside from a Cylon,
is there anything
that you hate more than a Sagittaron?
l'll tell you what l hate, Mike.
Being wrong.
- Captain Agathon.
- Sir.
Arrest this son of a bitch.
Gag him if you have to.
My pleasure, sir.
l didn't harm her.
Right. She's one of the good ones.
Sir. You wanted to see me?
Yes, Captain. Please, sit down.
There's hate, and there's allowing hate.
Two sides of the same coin, really.
We're guilty of both.
Somewhere, we got lost.
You being the Ione voice
in the wilderness,
we were bound to stay that way
for a while.
This is my ship.
And l owe you an apology.
- That's not necessary, sir.
- All the same...
you still have it.
That'll be all, Captain.
- l feel gloomy.
- OK.
Oh, my God!
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>
Congratulations on making captain.
Sorry l wasn't there.
- Thank you, sir.
- How's your mother?
Getting married.
In the mountains north of here
there's this little stream.
The water's so clear,
it's like looking through glass.
l'm thinking of building a cabin.
- <i>(Apollo) You and Cally have a fight?</i>
- <i>We should have sold tickets.</i>
To marriage - why we build bars.
It's not too late for Baltar
to just disappear.
l can't do that.
For all his crimes, he's one of us.
So what happens next?
We give him his trial.
<i>(buzzer)</i>
- <i>(man) Colonel Tigh to see you, Admiral.</i>
- <i>(Adama)</i> Enter.
- You're up early.
- Couldn't sleep.
So l thought l'd make myself useful.
Happy anniversary, Bill.
- <i>(baby cries)</i>
- <i>(Cally)</i> Hey...
Shh.
It's OK.
It's OK.
l don't know. Here.
Just double-check it for me.
l think Daddy's getting good at this.
Daddy's tired of burning his wrists.
We gotta get ready.
We got morning watch.
- We were spending the day with Nicky.
- But Laskin and Perry called in sick.
- <i>(Nicky cries)</i>
- It's OK.
Shh.
So you volunteered us in their place?
We barely get any time off as it is.
You know the deck is short-handed.
The deck has been short-handed
since we got here.
Frakking daycare workers
see more of Nicky than we do.
Until the daycare workers figure out
how to strip a Viper, this is the way it'll be.
Hey, buddy. Come here.
Oh. Oh. Oh, l know.
l know, l know.
You just laid down, too, didn't you?
Come here. l got you.
<i>(sighs)</i>
Here you go.
l'll take him to daycare.
Come on, buddy.
Come on.
Hey!
Forgetting something?
- What's on duty schedule?
- <i>(Tigh)</i> Nothing sexy.
CO2 scrubber's out near sickbay.
Broken water line in the galley.
Oh, now that most of our Vipers
are out of dry dock,
Chiefs gonna have a look
at the servos in airlock 12.
Could you, please?
- Is that it?
- <i>(sighs)</i>
Fleet's quiet.
You can use some time for yourself.
l can handle first watch.
l'll be keeping my schedule.
This is just another day.
<i>(Carolanne) Just another day?</i>
<i>Maybe l should have married him</i>
<i>instead of you.</i>
<i>(Adama) l could have sold tickets to that.</i>
<i>(Carolanne)</i> We had some good times.
<i>(sighs)</i>
But more bad.
<i>But you keep bringing me back anyway.</i>
<i>Just this one day. Year after year.</i>
Only thing l can't understand is why.
- <i>(Adama)</i> Neither do I.
- <i>(man)</i> Excuse me, sir.
Put it on the table, uh, Private.
<i>(man)</i> Jaffee, sir.
- Would there be anything else, Admiral?
- That will be all, Jaffee.
- <i>(Carolanne) lt's going to be a long day.</i>
- <i>(Adama) lt always is.</i>
Morning, Chief.
- Is Nicky OK?
- Yeah, he's fine.
The first time he didn't cry
when l dropped him off at daycare.
So, Figurski. You gonna at least pretend
to do something today?
Oh, frakking scrubber.
It takes Adama two seconds to sign off
on an order that'll take us all day.
It'll take you all day, anyhow.
Seelix. Cally.
You're with me. Airlock 12.
- Seelix, can you get the door?
- Yep.
- <i>(Cally)</i> This place is a mess.
- The Cylons blew the hell out of it.
Nobody's been down here
since Damage Control plugged the holes.
- Seelix, can you hear me there?
- Yeah.
<i>See if you can find</i>
<i>the electrical diagrams for the airlock.</i>
OK.
Ooh, l did find
somebody's year-old lunch.
- He didn't even cry?
- Cal, l told you. Nicky is fine.
Anybody could've dragged a tool bag
here. It didn't have to be me.
Yeah, well, you know these gearing
systems better than anybody.
You want me to give you
special treatment? How'd that look?
l don't care!
We try to pretend our lives are exactly like
they were before we went to New Caprica.
But it <i>is</i> different.
We're married.
We have a son.
Yeah. It's just a little rough patch.
<i>(Cally) What if rough patches</i>
<i>are all we have left?</i>
We swore we would raise
Nicky ourselves.
Well, we swore a lot of things.
<i>The Cylons didn't exactly cooperate.</i>
<i>You wanna give me those wire cutters?</i>
<i>(alarm)</i>
What the hell?
<i>(sighs)</i> For frak's sake.
Seelix, what are you doing?
Open the door.
<i>(Seelix)</i> l didn't do anything.
<i>Chief, l'm picking up</i>
<i>a pressure differential in there.</i>
<i>It's nothing drastic,</i>
<i>but you guys are definitely losing air.</i>
It doesn't take much.
Once the airflow sensors
detect a big enough leak,
all the inner doors drop automatically.
It's just a safety precaution.
- l feel safer already.
- <i>Wait a second.</i>
<i>Are you saying that</i>
<i>the hull's been breached?</i>
"Breach" is a bit dramatic
but the air's going somewhere.
One of these patches must have cracked
when we came in.
As soon as we plug it and restore
the pressure, the door should open.
Then we pull the work orders on whoever
made these welds and kick their asses.
Yeah, well, the most important thing is to
keep breathing, so let's just find the leak.
- Ah.
- <i>(hissing)</i>
This is it, right here.
This one.
Leeson takes first watch.
Leeson takes first watch.
Kinsey checks the roster.
Kinsey checks the roster.
Jaffee brings me coffee.
Jaffee brings me coffee.
Are you still doing that?
The memory exercises?
Do you really think they expect you
to know all of their names?
- You never change, do you?
- <i>(laughs)</i>
One of the joys of being long dead...
l suppose.
Now, hurry.
You're going to be late meeting Laura.
<i>Maybe she's got a thing for bad boys.</i>
<i>She wouldn't be the first.</i>
She's the president
of the Twelve Colonies.
Oh, l'm sorry. l'm sorry.
Of course.
Since you've created
one godlike facade for yourself,
why not invent another one for her?
<i>lt's another excuse</i>
<i>to keep your distance.</i>
- Admiral.
- Madam President.
- How are you?
- Very good.
l'm sure this all could have been done
over the wireless,
but l was going stir-crazy
on Colonial One and l had to get out.
Deep-space pilots
used to call it OBE.
- What's OBE?
- Overcome by events.
And you're always welcome here.
You know that.
You may not feel that way after you finish
this. Tory actually drew up an agenda.
Baltar again.
Hm.
- Can't we give him back to the Cylons?
- You know how much l love that idea.
Unfortunately, given what little
l was able to glean from the Caprica Six,
l don't think the Cylons
would take him back.
Fine. Then try the son of a bitch
and be done with it.
We have to give him a trial, but under
what law? Caprican, Picon, Tauron?
Do we give him a jury trial?
Do we set up a tribunal?
We don't even have anything closely
resembling a comprehensive law library
and this fleet is not exactly brimming
with legal talent.
You bring lawyers into this, they're
gonna drag you around for months.
Wasn't your father
an attorney on Caprica?
Yes. l told you
l didn't get along with him very well.
Oh, right, OK.
l'm ready to set up
an organising committee,
but frankly, trying to get a room
full of legal scholars to stay on task
is like herding cats, and so l need
to set up a chairman of this committee.
Somebody who can make a hard decision
and won't get seduced by all the legalese.
- Do you have a candidate?
- In fact, l do. l was thinking Lee.
Like grandfather, like grandson.
What do you think?
l'm not gonna say
he's incapable of handling it,
but he's never shown
any type of interest in law.
l know, but here's the thing.
We can use the lawyers to parse the law
but we need people who know
the difference between right and wrong.
- That's Lee.
- l'll talk to him.
Good.
Also, Admiral?
l was wondering if you'd mind if l stayed
on your ship for the rest of the day.
Please. By all means.
This is very difficult for me to say,
but l'm going to go to the gym.
Prepare yourself. On its best days
it smells like the inside of a shoe.
<i>(laughs)</i>
<i>(alarm)</i>
See if there's another patch. l want to
double up on this one, make sure it holds.
- Come on, Cal. Faster is better.
- l heard you the first time.
Sir.
Sir.
Admiral.
<i>(laughter)</i>
<i>(laughter stops)</i>
<i>(Carolanne) You're better</i>
<i>at ignoring all that.</i>
<i>That sudden hush, those sidelong</i>
<i>glances. That really used to get to you.</i>
l don't ever recall
being able to intimidate you.
That's right. But l knew you
long before you were the admiral.
Back when you were just Bill.
The husband who wasn't there.
The father who left.
Just Bill.
Who is Bill Adama, anyway?
It's still a good question.
<i>l wonder if l'll get an answer.</i>
49 days without a sighting.
Maybe we finally scared the toasters off.
Oh, yeah, Narcho. Your crap flying's
put the fear of the gods in 'em.
What's up, buddy?
What's the matter with you?
Sorry. l've got the weirdest rash.
Really?
Hope she was worth it, buddy.
Ten-hut!
<i>(Apollo)</i> At ease.
Before we get started,
l want a show of hands.
How many of you boneheads
know how to count?
l keep hearing numbers
thrown around the hangar deck.
47, then 48,
now 49 days
since our last enemy contact.
Now, l realise that any higher math's
probably beyond most of you,
so l'm gonna make this
real simple for you.
One is the only number
you need to remember.
Because all it takes is for one pilot
to let his guard down,
one ECO to miss a DRADIS contact,
and suddenly the Cylons
are on top of us.
That's when people die.
<i>(Adama) He's like both of us.</i>
Proud, stubborn and angry.
<i>But he's coming into his own,</i>
<i>especially in the last few months.</i>
<i>(Carolanne) Don't tell me.</i>
- Tell him.
- He knows.
Knows what?
That the admiral's going to give him
a good performance review?
<i>Or that his father loves him?</i>
Don't tell me the admiral's façade
extends to Lee, too.
<i>(Apollo)</i> Formation flying.
Deflection shooting.
Tactics. Doing touch-and-gos until
every last one of you hits an OK-three.
Red and blue sections will go first.
Yellow and green will follow.
Skids up in ten minutes.
Dismissed.
Starbuck, if you've got a problem,
l don't want to hear about it.
My only problem is that you didn't
preach that sermon a week ago.
Find some new material, though.
The old man's been using that
"one fatal mistake" line since we got here.
If you're gonna steal,
steal from the best.
Sir.
Pretty tough on them today.
A kick in the butt
is worth a thousand words.
Gods know you kicked mine enough.
- Everything OK?
- Yeah, it's been one of those mornings.
The president wants
to fast-track Baltar's trial.
She wants someone
to take charge of the preliminaries,
help cobble together the legal framework.
She wants me to assign you.
You're kidding.
Interested?
Uh, more surprised.
Did she say why she asked for me?
She's gonna need someone
that she can trust.
You definitely fit that.
l remember when you were younger,
you'd go visit your grandfather's house.
You were fascinated
with his papers and his law books.
<i>(laughs)</i>
And there was me
thinking l was being sly,
sneaking off into his office
all by myself.
l guess it's a pipe dream now,
but for five minutes there
l really did consider lawyer
as one of a dozen careers that l could
go into before l joined the service.
Hm.
l never knew that.
Well, it was probably during
one of my, um..."angry at Dad" phases.
Anyway, it's impossible.
Even if l wanted to help out,
there's no way.
CAG's duty's already 24-7,
even on a light week.
Yeah. l assumed that.
<i>(Narcho)</i> Major? We're ready for you.
Excuse me.
<i>(alarm continues)</i>
Yeah, well, one's gonna have to do.
Seelix? Check the pressure.
If that patch holds, we'll equalise in
a few minutes and this door's gonna open.
<i>(hissing)</i>
Oh, my gods.
<i>(air escaping)</i>
- How are they doing?
- Still alive.
<i>(woman on PA) This is a condition three</i>
<i>alert. Hull breach on deck 14.</i>
Chief.
Admiral.
l seem to have turned this
into a full-blown FUBAR.
<i>You'd be doing us a hell of a favour</i>
<i>if you get those doors open.</i>
We gotta get them out of there.
Keep moving. Keep moving.
The airlock's designed to lock down
if the pressure decreases.
l know the system.
We have redundancies, we have backups.
The manual override is down. There is no
way of getting those inner doors to open.
- It must have taken heavy damage.
- The whole ship's taken a pounding.
We need six weeks just to hammer out
the dings, let alone the structural damage.
- How much time do they have?
- They'll be out of air in half an hour.
Those are blast doors. It would take
at least an hour to cut through them.
Why don't we put explosives
in the observation booth? Blow the glass.
No, the glass can withstand
a tylium explosion.
Anything strong enough to take out
the glass will take out Tyrol and Cally too.
l need a rescue plan,
not excuses.
- Seven seconds.
- And another ten to repressurise,
since we'll be doing this in open space.
That's pushing it.
All right. Has anyone ever tried
a rescue like this before?
- No one's ever been crazy enough.
- We're out of time. Prep for launch.
- We've only got 18 minutes left.
- All right. Let's go. We're on.
<i>(Cally)</i> Galen.
<i>(Adama) Airlock's still jammed, Chief.</i>
<i>Overrides are not responding.</i>
l guess we're kind of running out
of options.
<i>l'm gonna take you out</i>
<i>through the front door.</i>
You'll put a ship out there
and rig up some kind of docking collar?
<i>You'll be out of air in a few minutes.</i>
<i>There's no time for a collar.</i>
<i>Sir, if you're talking about an EVA</i>
<i>we don't have pressure suits.</i>
We don't have a choice.
Athena's gonna position her Raptor
in front of the airlock, hatch open.
We're gonna blow the bolts
off that door
and when it opens up,
you're gonna have to jump for it.
Now, listen to me, both of you.
You can do this.
<i>People have been able to live</i>
<i>up to a minute in exposure without a suit.</i>
- Admiral, l don't know.
- <i>We'll talk later.</i>
<i>Get ready.</i>
<i>(woman) Athena, you have priority</i>
<i>clearance. All other traffic is waved away.</i>
<i>(Cally) Wait. (sobs)</i>
- What about Nicky?
- Admiral's right.
We have to prep.
l'll move everything
away from here to the door.
Galen, we both know what happens
to kids in the fleet
when their parents
aren't there for them.
<i>Apollo and Dee.</i>
<i>They'll take care of him.</i>
<i>No. No pilots.</i>
<i>He's not going through this twice.</i>
Sir?
There's a civilian family.
Mother's name is Susan Settler.
She has a little girl.
- If anything happens to us...
- <i>l'll see to it.</i>
l was being selfish.
l wanted you with me,
like old times.
l didn't think about Nick.
<i>l'm sorry.</i>
Admiral's gonna get us
out of here, OK?
We're gonna take care of Nicky.
More than a few seconds out there,
we're talking severe exposure,
decompression sickness,
hypothermia - they could freeze to death.
Make sure Cottle's got
his hyperbaric chamber ready.
<i>(Cally) l'm sorry.</i>
<i>Galactica, Apollo. Bringing Raptor</i>
<i>into position at E mark 12.</i>
Put your mask on.
Listen up. We don't have time
to hang back until the airlock doors blow
so we're liable to experience some
turbulence, maybe some shrapnel hits.
Athena, you're going to have
to be ready to compensate.
l'm on it, Major. l'll hold position
until Chief and Cally are secured.
Let's just get this done.
<i>Galactica,</i> Apollo. Raptor door is open.
We're standing by. Ready to execute.
Chief, Cally.
<i>Raptor's in position.</i>
<i>We've got to go now.</i>
Get ready to blow the hatch,
on my mark.
OK.
No matter what,
you hold onto me.
And don't let go. OK.
Three.
<i>Two.</i>
One. Do it.
<i>(Apollo)</i> Whoa! Watch out!
Big break! Big break!
<i>(alarm)</i>
- <i>(Starbuck)</i> We're in position.
- Pull up your nose. Pull up!
- <i>(Sharon)</i> l've got it!
- <i>(Apollo)</i> Hold it right there.
<i>Galactica, Apollo. Raptor secured</i>
<i>and pressurised. They are both safe.</i>
<i>We've got to get them</i>
<i>to sickbay right away.</i>
Come in.
So, any word on Chief and Cally?
They're alive, but Doc Cottle's
still evaluating their condition.
So, are you gonna tell me
what's going on with you?
It's this day.
<i>(Apollo)</i> My gods,
your wedding anniversary.
l had totally forgotten.
Probably seems foolish, especially
the way that it all ended up, but...
still...
It still means something to me.
We've never talked about it.
The divorce.
Your mother.
It was a bad time for all of us.
Your mother gave you
and your brother a home. Stability.
Dad, l know you want
to believe that, but, um...
You know what? Forget it.
It was a long time ago.
- <i>(sighs)</i>
- You have something to say, just say it.
<i>(sighs)</i>
Dad, we had four walls.
But stability?
My gods, you know
what Mom was like.
l mean, the mood swings...
It's why you left her.
We had problems, but she cared deeply
for you and your brother.
Things changed after you left.
l mean, there were times
when she lost control.
- <i>(Carolanne) Don't listen to him.</i>
- <i>(Apollo) She would try and apologise.</i>
<i>She would promise</i>
<i>that she would make things better.</i>
<i>But then she would start drinking.</i>
And then all of her good intentions
would go flying out the frakking window.
- <i>(Adama)</i> Is that true?
- l can't believe you'd even ask me that!
Dammit. Is it true?
<i>(Apollo)</i> Then one day
the apologies even stopped.
That's enough.
You walked out on me!
You walked out on me!
The brilliant commander
who could lead all of his men into combat
but he couldn't find a way
to live with his own family!
We never lived anywhere
for more than six months.
Just following you around from one base
to another, waiting for you to come home!
But you weren't here for any of us!
It was always whatever was easiest
for the great Adama!
They needed you.
They were our children.
They needed a father.
All through your glorious career,
you have prided yourself
on being a leader of men,
judging people,
always making the hard call.
But when it came to
the biggest decision of your life...
Oh, Bill, you blew it.
We were wrong for each other from
day one, but you just couldn't accept that.
<i>That's it. That's why</i>
<i>you keep calling me back.</i>
<i>Because if you had made</i>
<i>that mistake...</i>
<i>it would just call into question</i>
<i>all of your other decisions.</i>
<i>(Adama) She was still your mother, Lee.</i>
l loved her.
<i>(Apollo)</i> l believe you.
l just don't think she ever loved you.
He's right over here.
Hey.
l dropped by daycare.
Somebody wanted to see you.
- Who's that?
- Hey, little man.
- How's she doing?
- Doc Cottle says she'll be OK,
but it's gonna be a while
before she's 100°/Ş.
<i>(groans)</i>
Oh, careful.
- You all right?
- Yeah, l'm fine.
- <i>(Nicky cries)</i>
- Oh, l know.
- Come here.
- Oh...
l've got you.
Oh, come here.
You want to go see Mommy?
Go see Mommy?
Hey. Yeah.
Let's go see Mommy.
Come on.
She's over here. Yeah.
Cal.
Cal. Sweetie?
Look who's here.
Look who's here.
Seelix.
l don't know how we will manage,
but we'll find a balance, you and me.
We will take care of Nick. OK?
l love you.
Look. There's Mommy's hand.
There. There.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How are you?
Good.
- So, what's this?
- Oh, it was here when l got in.
It's from your father.
Is it ticking?
He left you a note.
<i>Caprican Criminal Codes.</i>
These were
my grandfather's law books.
Your dad must have had these
in storage all this time.
Why is he giving them to you now?
<i>(Apollo)</i> "For that day
when we all have the time."
<i>(Roslin) l have something for you.</i>
This was given to me by one of
the colonists down on New Caprica.
l forgot about it
and Tory found it in a pile of old clothes.
- <i>Blood Runs at Midnight.</i>
- Don't let that fool you.
It's a pretty good mystery.
l think you'll like it.
And it's not a loan.
It's a gift.
Do you ever think about the times much
on New Caprica?
l try to think about the good times.
Yes, l do.
One in particular
stands out in my mind.
You were wearing
a really bright red dress.
Said you wanted to build a cabin.
It was Baltar's
ground-breaking ceremony.
l got a little silly that night.
Ever wonder what would've happened
if the Cylons hadn't come back?
Well, l think given Baltar and the terrain
we couldn't have made a go of it.
Do you think you would have stayed
on <i>Galactica</i> or would you have settled?
It's pretty hypothetical. Isn't it?
It is, until it isn't.
<i>(laughs)</i>
- Did l just say that?
- It's worth just seeing you laugh like that.
We've been at war for so long,
we forget what we're fighting for.
To raise our kids in peace.
Enjoy one another's company.
- Live life as people again.
- Like that night on New Caprica.
That's really what we are talking about
here now, isn't it?
That, and other times.
So if the Cylons hadn't come back?
But they did.
We have certain responsibilities.
Yes, we do, sir. And, uh...
l will be back in a few days, and if you'd
like, we can talk more about that night.
Bill?
The answer is yes.
l absolutely would have built the cabin.
<i>(Carolanne) Go ahead. Put it away,</i>
<i>like you have after every anniversary.</i>
- Promise me you won't take it out again.
- <i>(Adama)</i> It'd be easier to hate you.
But that would be a lie, Carolanne.
And there's been enough of that
through our lives.
We had something, didn't we?
Yeah.
We had something.
See you next year.
This'll mark new territory.
Don't do it!
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>
l demand my rights, as a Colonial citizen,
to legal representation and due process.
Do you?
- So what happens next?
- We give him his trial.
My father was a priest,
my mother an oracle.
l've served on battlestars
since l was 18.
When you elected me union president,
l promised l would keep us working.
Throw your body on the gears, the levers,
on the machine itself and make it stop.
<i>(chanting)</i> Chief! Chief! Chief! Chief!
We try to pretend our lives are exactly like
they were before we went to New Caprica.
- But it <i>is</i> different.
- We're just going through a rough patch.
What if rough patches
are all we have left?
<i>(Chief)</i> Figurski, Pollux, Sanchez - you're
gonna be rehabbing mule engines tonight.
Set the hull SOL checks rigs
to SEC.
<i>(Figurski)</i> Thought we were
subbing out maintenance to civvies.
<i>(Chief)</i> Don't got enough mechanics
down there.
- Check flow rate.
- <i>(Pollux)</i> Flow rate steady at 2-9-0.
When are we getting some rec?
l did double watches for two weeks.
- <i>(Chief)</i> l know, l know.
- Plus, l still got the ringing in my ears.
<i>(Figurski)</i> Whoo-hoo-hoo!
<i>(Chief)</i> Sorry, l can't hear you.
l've got ringing. What's that?
<i>(Pollux)</i> Real funny, guys.
- Fuse indicators are out.
- Set the wing tank switch to fuel.
Power off.
All right, tank off.
That's it.
Kill the fuelling station.
Pull the hose.
LT, you're tanked up and ready to roll.
Roger that, Chief.
Ready to roll.
Laundry call.
Figurski, Pollux, Redford - grab your crap
before l chuck it in the 'cycler.
- Fold my undies the way l like?
- Frak off.
Nice mouth.
You think they let officers talk like that?
Gonna have to change
when you get them wings.
l'm not getting wings.
They rejected my application
for flight training.
l thought you aced the exam.
Interview went well?
It turns out l'm
in a "critical position"
and my leaving would cause
"severe mission degradation".
- That sucks.
- Critical position, my ass!
They just don't want knuckle-draggers
stinking up the pilot ready room.
All right, that's enough.
Lock it up.
The CAG told me you got bounced
from flight training. l'm sorry - it sucks.
We need you here -
you're our best avionics specialist.
And she knows
how to fold a man's undies.
- Hey!
- You frak.
- Enough! Get off.
- l'll take you apart!
Shut up, Figurski, or l'll pump you in
the mouth myself. Now get back to work.
- Come here.
- Let go of me.
Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me.
Look, you do important work down here -
just as important as sitting in a cockpit.
Thanks, Chief.
l'm gonna deliver some more
"important" laundry.
Raptor away.
Readings nominal.
<i>Everything looks good.</i>
- Setting course heading 2-9-6-5...
- <i>(crash)</i>
- What the frak?
- It's a flameout! RCS thruster's jammed.
Restart.
No go!
<i>"Galactica", Skulls. Engine thruster stuck</i>
<i>in full position. Engine one won't start.</i>
There's a fire in engine two.
It's gonna blow. Get your ass up here.
Eject! Eject! Eject!
We got off lucky -
a dozen injuries, no fatalities.
Thank you.
You should've seen Tory's shoulder. l had
to help Cottle put it back into alignment.
You know, l am so busy, l hardly ever
make it down to this end of the ship.
And now l'm gonna be living here
until they repair the bulkheads.
If the quarters become cramped,
you're always welcome in one of my beds.
In a manner of speaking.
- Any idea what happened to your Raptor?
- We're still investigating.
But it seems that the tylium was
seriously contaminated with impurities.
Most likely it's a problem
with the refining process.
What's going on? The refinery
used to be our most reliable ship.
Now every day l start with
a stack of messages from that chief...
- Xeno Fenner.
- Fenner.
...complaining about working conditions
and deliveries and, uh...
spare parts and compensation -
if you can believe that.
We're on the run for our lives, and the guy
wants to talk about overtime bonuses.
We've been more than patient with Fenner
and his production problems -
two weeks of waiting for him
to get his act together.
l don't know about you, but l'm ready
to get back on the road to finding Earth.
<i>(whispers)</i> Is that a hint of hope l hear?
Is the sceptic suddenly decided
that we're on the road to Earth after all?
Have l ever doubted it?
l've had people working 18-hour shifts
for the past six months.
How long can a man
keep that up?
If the Cylons show up, we have enough
fuel to jump the entire fleet, what, once?
- Mm-hm.
- Maybe twice.
That's a margin
that's much too narrow for me.
How about for you and your men?
You have a problem, fix it.
Just get the gas flowing.
And then we'll talk, l promise you that.
"Then we'll talk."
It's always later.
You know, it's funny that when the gas
flows, my phone calls don't get returned,
but the minute there's
a glitch in supply,
l've got face time
with the president and the admiral.
Hmm. Maybe we should
just start having more glitches.
- Is that a threat?
- It's like the book says:
"If you hear the people,
you'll never have to fear the people."
- Did you say "the book"?
- Mm-hm.
Guards, arrest him -
for extortion and interrupting vital services
during a time of war.
Go ahead, take him away.
Go. Out of here. Guard.
Come with me, sir.
- What the hell was that?
- He was quoting from Baltar's book.
The ramblings that his lawyer
smuggled out of the brig?
He's having it reprinted
and passed out among the fleet,
and he's calling it <i>My Triumphs,</i>
<i>My Mistakes</i> by Gaius Baltar.
l am thinking of having
a good old-fashioned book-burning.
Algae meatloaf -
starting to be a favourite.
It's not for you.
Remember our little talk?
Oh, but today's my cheat day.
The last three days
have been your cheat day.
Really? Eugh.
You were moving better yesterday. Is that
how the bends are supposed to work?
l'm just upset about Seelix,
so l'm tensing up.
They should've told her right off the bat
what the fleet priorities are.
Should've said that they needed
knuckle-draggers more than pilots.
It isn't about fleet priorities.
We're not the ruling class,
so we're stuck doing the dirty work.
- "Ruling class"? Where'd you get that?
- Something l read.
By Baltar.
His frakking rag's going around? l can't
believe anybody'd read anything by him.
That's what l thought too, but...
Ever wonder why all the pilots and
the officers come from the rich colonies
like Caprica and Virgon
and Tauron,
while all the knuckle-draggers
come from the poor colonies
like Aerelon and Sagitarron
and Gemenon?
- Yeah, that's just trash talk on the deck.
- Really?
Name one officer
that comes from a poor colony.
Lieutenant Dualla's from Sagitarron.
Case in point!
How did she get promoted?
She married an officer from Caprica.
<i>(phone ringing)</i>
Tyrol.
<i>(Adama) The foreman at the fuel refinery's</i>
<i>just been arrested.</i>
- <i>Xeno Fenner?</i>
- Know him?
- Did something happen to Xeno?
- Arrested.
Yes, sir. He was in the union on
New Caprica. He seemed like a good guy.
- What'd he do?
- He pissed off the president.
The bigger problem
is the refining operation.
<i>l need someone</i>
<i>to get that fuel ship moving again.</i>
Pick a team
and be on the hangar deck in an hour.
Yes, sir.
- What happened to Xeno?
- He pissed off the president.
- You can get arrested for that now?
- l think the admiral was kidding.
- <i>(Nicky gargles)</i>
- Yeah!
- You ever think about the union?
- Sure, but that's gone now.
New Caprica's gone, but all
the people in the union are still here.
The only difference is, now they don't
have anyone to stand up for them.
l gotta go.
l do hope you're enjoying yourselves.
It's not enough that
you have to interrupt my sleep,
now you have to destroy my stuff as well.
You're pathetic!
You're utterly and totally...
Hello, Doctor.
Why don't you do yourself a favour? Hand
over the pages and stop all this nonsense.
- l don't know what you're talking about.
- Turn him around.
The pages to your book, <i>My Triumphs,</i>
<i>My Mistakes</i> by Gaius Baltar.
So you've read it.
The people are reading it,
and now you're sorry.
We knew your lawyer was smuggling
the pages out, so we intercepted them.
l'm the only one who's read the book,
and l am dying to see how it ends.
Really, what were you thinking,
casting yourself as a man of the people,
a son of a farmer,
a revolutionary?
Oh, please.
It may come as a surprise, but l wished
to strike a chord with the common man.
Hand over those pages, or l'll have
these guards search you. Make a choice.
Gentlemen, proceed.
Don't bend to her, Gaius.
Show her that she can't break you.
Keep your dignity.
Perhaps you'd consider
writing a blurb for the back cover.
Thank you, Doctor.
<i>(guard)</i> Close the cell.
It's all right, Gaius.
Everything will be OK.
- Tyrol.
- Cabott. Hey. How are you doing?
Good to see you.
- Sorry.
- Never mind. It's inevitable.
Listen, we all started feeling a lot better
when we heard they were sending you.
- Oh, yeah?
- You bet.
l've been telling everybody how the union
on New Caprica stood up for the little guy.
Yeah, well...
<i>(Cabott)</i> You're looking at
the fleet's entire supply of tylium.
- <i>(Chief)</i> How many jumps we got?
- We'll be lucky if we get outta the system.
<i>(Chief)</i> You'd better give us the nickel tour,
see where we stand.
<i>(woman on PA) Second shift,</i>
<i>report for duty at starboard bay five.</i>
- It's a big operation.
- You should see it when it's running.
Loud as an A-bomb,
and just about as safe.
Listen, we really need this downtime.
l mean, look around.
Next time some machine fraks up,
it might not just take out a Raptor.
This ship really is a big bomb
just waiting to go up.
l understand the risk,
but l need to see it working,
so pull your guys off,
and let's fire it up.
It ain't gonna work.
- You work here?
- This is Milo, the best grease jockey l got.
Milo, huh?
So why is it not gonna work?
Something you guys aren't telling me?
Come on.
OK. l guess l'm just gonna have
to have a look for myself.
Is that pressure relief?
- The seals are missing.
- They all are.
Without pressure seals,
the machinery won't run. Where are they?
Guess they got lost, huh?
You can't frak around.
The admiral won't stand for it.
- The admiral can kiss my ass!
- Hey! Hey!
Come on, Chief,
you know what this is about.
When working conditions improve and
they let Xeno out, we'll find those seals.
Until then, it looks like this ship isn't
gonna be refining another drop of tylium.
And that means
this fleet isn't going anywhere.
l've executed a search of the ship,
but the seals have not turned up.
You know that this is sabotage.
l'm inclined to have them locked up.
Please. They could've rigged
something to have me injured.
They could have contaminated the fuel
on purpose, left our ships dead in the air.
- Good gods!
- All they did do was buy some time.
The machinery needs overhauling.
There's a reason quality control is failing.
Do you realise
most of the workers on that ship
have not had a day off
since the original attack on the Colonies?
- It's like slave labour.
- Don't be absurd.
The people aboard that ship
are stuck there.
- They have no control over their lives.
- And the work is hard, we know that.
Do they think they're having a picnic on
the algae-processing plant, or munitions?
The fleet is full of people
working under horrific conditions.
- Nobody's having a good time.
- l think that if we at least release Xeno,
talk to them about improving
working and living conditions,
that the protest will go away,
they'll return the seals,
and we'll get the fuel problem
under control.
Extortion is not
an acceptable method of protest.
What are the names of the leaders?
- Just Cabott.
- l will issue a warrant for his arrest.
Put him in the brig,
let him sweat it out.
Admiral, Madam President,
they're just trying to...
Chief, uh-uh. We're done.
<i>(heavy sigh)</i>
l'm gonna go check on
Cabott and Xeno.
Chief.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You gotta get him outta here.
- What the hell happened to his hands?
- He was scratching the walls.
- He kept scratching until his fingers bled.
- <i>(Cabott)</i> l won't say.
He was in Cylon detention
on New Caprica, you remember?
He came out all squirrelly, and this is not
helping. You gotta get him outta here.
It doesn't matter.
l won't say.
- <i>(sobbing)</i>
- <i>(sighs)</i>
- Where are the seals?
- Oh, you son of a bitch.
- Come on.
- Galen, you gotta get him outta here.
- Cabott?
- No, l won't...
- Cabott, look at me!
- l won't...
Cabott, where are the seals?
- l won't say. It doesn't matter.
- l can get you outta here.
- Tell me where the seals are.
- l won't say.
- For gods' sake, get him out of here!
- Where... where are the seals?
- Where are they?
- It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter!
- Where are the seals?
- It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter!
- Where are they?
- The air vent! All right?
- They're in the centre stern air vent!
- Tell the president to release them.
Frak!
<i>(Cabott hyperventilating)</i>
All right, that's the last one.
Let's fire this up, get back to work.
Yes, sir. Whatever you say, boss.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Can l throw the switch?
- How old are you?
- 12.
Almost.
But l can run every machine we got.
Only thing l haven't done
is turn the whole thing on.
It's all yours.
<i>(machinery powering up)</i>
<i>(bell)</i>
<i>(PA) Workers to your stations.</i>
<i>All workers to your stations.</i>
- <i>(Chief)</i> There are kids down there.
- There's children on every ship.
These children work in the refinery.
They're 12, 15 years old.
There have been families aboard
the refinery since its beginning,
and others were picked up
after the Cylons attacked the Colonies.
Over the past two years,
parents have taught children
how to operate the machinery -
they have passed along their skills.
It is perfectly normal.
It is not ideal, l know that.
But there's nothing ideal
about this fleet!
Do you see what's happening?
Jobs are starting to be inherited,
Madam President.
We don't know how long we'll be here.
What if it's ten years?
So l train my son to be a deck hand
because that's what l am,
and that's all he can ever be?
Is that the future we want?
That's a really good point.
Make a list of everyone who has
a work history appropriate to the refinery -
factory workers, mechanics,
whatever you think.
Give it to the chief,
and l want you to hold a public lottery.
We will take people from other vessels
and put them on shifts in the refinery.
How's that, Chief?
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
<i>(Chief)</i> So that's our allotment
from Dogsville.
We'll get these people outta here
before they know where they're going.
- All right, people...
- Excuse me. Sir?
Hi. l don't know
who l'm supposed to talk to about this,
but l don't think l'm what you guys are
looking for. l don't really have the skills.
- What's your name?
- Daniel Noon.
Figurski. Noon?
Noon. Noon...
Noon, Daniel. Says you're a farmer.
We need people
to work with heavy machinery.
No, but l don't. Not really.
l worked on a farm for a summer
cos l was saving to go to college,
architecture, but then the Cylons attacked.
And now l'm a farmer?
How is that fair?
How is it in any way fair?
Just give me a second.
We make an exception for him,
there'll be 15 more right behind him.
Look at him, though.
He's a kid.
Fine. Put him on the ship.
Look, this is just
a temporary thing, OK?
Wait. Hold on.
l'm not a farmer.
- It's not permanent.
- Can you just check my record?
- Yeah.
- Who am l supposed to talk to about this?
Who am l supposed to talk to about this?
l'm not a farmer!
Hey, stop it!
l'm not a farmer!
- What are you doing here?
- Your book: fact or fiction?
So you read it?
Well, that proves that the president's
an accomplished liar.
She told me it hadn't gone out.
So, what do you make of it?
l think that it's a pile of crap.
Obviously, my analysis
of a bifurcated society scares you.
But everything in my book
happens to be true.
Oh, it's true? It's true
that you're a farm boy from Aerelon?
It is, as a matter of fact.
l was born and raised on a dairy
outside the town of
Cuttlesbreath Wash on Aerelon.
Why do l have such a hard time
picturing you milking cows
and shovelling manure?
Lack of imagination?
Or maybe that your little tale
is manure.
Hm?
l've known people from Aerelon.
You don't sound anything like them.
- l don't sound like l'm from Aerelon?
- No.
Well, l take that
as a particular compliment.
l don't know about you,
but l find the Aerelon dialect
to be particularly hard on the ears.
<i>(accent changes)</i> The consonants
scrape the back of the throat.
l know a lot about my native tongue.
l spent hours on end trying to overcome it.
Do you have any idea how hard it is
for a ten-year-old boy
to change the way he speaks?
To unlearn everything he ever learned,
so that one day...
one day there might be
the small hope...
that he might be considered
as not coming from Aerelon?
Maybe, l don't know, Caprica.
<i>(voice changes back)</i>
Caprica? Oh, to be Caprican.
The seat of politics, culture,
art, science, learning.
And what was Aerelon?
Just a drab, ugly rock
<i>(accent changes)</i> condemned to be
the food basket for the 12 worlds.
And that's how we were treated -
like servants, like labourers,
like working class.
You know, you would have
fitted right in there.
Lots of men who liked to work with their
hands, and grab a pint down the pub,
and finish off the evening
with a good old-fashioned fight.
<i>(voice changes)</i> Oh, yes...
l left Aerelon after my 18th birthday.
l turned my back on my family,
on my heritage...
All of them.
Of course, it doesn't matter,
they're all dead now.
You do realise
that none of that exists here?
<i>(laughs)</i>
Coming from the mouth of a mechanic!
We've kept democracy.
We have government, we have rights,
we have elections...
Well, then you should feel
perfectly happy, perfectly at ease!
Go home, leave me in peace.
That's what the aristocracy wants.
It wants the working class
to feel looked after,
while they scrabble around for scraps
from the master's table!
There's a question l ask at the end of my
book. l'll save you the trouble of reading it.
"Will the fleet ever be commanded by
somebody whose name is not Adama?"
There it is, Chief -
one set of rules for the aristocracy,
and one set of rules for the rest of us.
<i>(woman on PA) First shift of cleanup crew,</i>
<i>report for duty in starboard bay.</i>
We've assigned all the new workers
from the lottery.
- Looks like you put 'em right to work.
- They're OK.
They're a little skittish,
but they'll catch on.
Here's where we had
the problem last time.
We got all kinds of gear slippage,
temperature variations.
We didn't know the dross
wasn't getting burned off.
- That's the bad fuel?
- It's running now.
But we got other places on the line
that could frak us.
- <i>(rumbling)</i>
- What's that?
- Hit the switch!
- Not when it's jammed.
The system will seize up.
Gotta find it.
Otherwise, the ore still in the chambers
will superheat and blow us all to hell.
Hurry! We gotta get this going.
Right here. This is it.
- Got it? Get it out of there.
- Yeah.
- l can't get my hands around it.
- Give it a yank.
l can't get my hand on it!
- Argh!
- Careful. Careful!
- l can't get under it.
- We got some hot rocks up there.
You gotta get this thing started, fast!
- Give it a yank!
- l just can't get my hand around it.
l can't get my hand on it.
- l can try. l can try...
- <i>(Fenner)</i> Get in there.
- l can probably fit.
- <i>(Chief)</i> Come on.
If he clears it, the belt will jump.
Careful.
- Way in the back...
- There you go.
- <i>(Chief)</i> You got it, you got it. Attaboy.
- <i>(Fenner)</i> Be careful!
<i>(clanking)</i>
Come on, Danny, get ahold of it.
Attaboy!
Now grab it.
Pull it towards you.
Pull on it. Pull on it.
Pull on it, Danny.
<i>(machinery clanks into action)</i>
<i>(Fenner)</i> Yes! All right!
- Good work, Danny.
- <i>(Fenner)</i> Get out of there. Come on out.
<i>(screaming)</i>
Medic! Medic!
Medic! Now!
- <i>(screaming continues)</i>
- Take it easy, buddy. We got you.
<i>(Fenner)</i> It's OK.
You did a great job.
<i>(screaming continues)</i>
- <i>(woman)</i> You're gonna be OK.
- <i>(Seelix)</i> You're gonna be OK.
<i>(Fenner)</i> You're gonna be OK.
<i>(Danny groans)</i>
l need more gauze.
Just calm down.
That's it. Gimme some more.
This plant's offline!
We're on strike!
<i>(Figurski)</i> Action time.
- Need something, Captain?
- l frakking do: my Viper.
Sorry, Captain, vital missions only.
CAP's already up. We did our job.
- "Vital missions only"?
- Whose orders?
Cally relayed the orders
from Chief Tyrol.
We're on strike.
Admiral.
Are you aware that your deck gang
is participating in a work stoppage?
- It's called a general strike, sir.
- It's a mutiny.
And do you know
what we do with mutineers?
We shoot them, Chief.
We're leaving people behind.
People who are locked into their jobs,
have no control over their lives, no say.
- We're abandoning them to their fate.
- That is not the issue.
The men and women on this ship
are not allowed to disobey an order,
especially in support of
some kind of frakking labour dispute.
We launched the CAP. No one abandoned
their post, no one's in danger.
This is mutiny.
And it stops now.
Admiral, all l want
is a sit down with the president.
This is the admiral.
Arrest Cally Tyrol.
Take her under armed guard
directly to the starboard repair bay.
- What are you doing?
- l'm gonna put her against the bulkhead,
and l'm gonna shoot her
as a mutineer.
Are you outta your frakking mind?!
Cally was following my orders.
She's a ringleader,
so she goes first.
Then the rest of your deck gang:
Figurski, Seelix, Pollux.
<i>(slams bars)</i>
You won't do this.
- We have a son.
- Understand me:
the very survival of this ship may depend
on someone getting an order
that they don't wanna do.
And if they hesitate,
if they feel that orders
are sometimes optional,
then this ship will perish.
And so will your son.
And the entire human race.
l don't wanna do this, Chief.
But l will put ten Callys
up against the wall
to make sure that this ship and this fleet
are not destroyed.
Fine.
l'll call it off.
This is the admiral.
Do you have Cally in custody?
Put her on.
Open the door.
- You OK?
- <i>Don't worry. l've been in the brig before.</i>
<i>(Chief) Everything's OK.</i>
<i>Call off the strike.</i>
Did they cave?
Yeah. Call it off.
<i>l knew it.</i>
<i>l'll take care of it.</i>
Galen, l'm proud of you.
Give the phone to the marine.
Release her.
You can go now, Chief.
l thought you had something that
you wanted to discuss with the president.
- Would you like another drink?
- <i>(Chief)</i> l think l've had enough.
Madam President,
l've seen people drafted into service
based purely on
where they were born.
They've also been selected
based on their skills.
Which is a result of
where they were born.
Capricans are more likely to be
professionals. Aerelons, farmers.
- It's just a fact of life.
- It's a fact l can't change.
True. But l think
we can level the playing field.
There are a lot of dirty jobs that need
to be done every day in this fleet:
cleaning, hauling,
low-level maintenance, things like that.
These are the kind of jobs that l think
should be allocated to people...
Well, people like yourself -
no offence.
None taken. Go ahead.
Let some of the people on <i>Colonial One</i>
get their hands dirty for a change.
Done. What else?
People that are in dangerous
and high-stress jobs need R and R.
In order to do that,
we need a formal training programme.
We can talk about
a training programme later.
We need to focus on maintaining
the workforce that we have,
and this is gonna have to be an area
where the union gives ground.
- The union?
- Oh, l'm sorry.
l thought you were bargaining on behalf
of the Colonial Workers' Alliance.
- If that's not the case, then...
- Madam President,
that union died on New Caprica.
The workers in this fleet need someone
to represent them and their interests.
And if this society
is becoming truly polarised
between an entrenched political class
and a disenfranchised underclass,
we are doomed.
We won't need Cylons to destroy us,
we'll destroy ourselves.
The fleet that arrives at Earth
will not represent Colonial society at all.
l am willing to fight for that society
until my dying breath.
l would love it if
you would fight for that society as well.
l will.
l will, Madam President. l will.
Pollux and Herschel,
you are on fuelling, 43-72.
- Chief Tyrol?
- Hey, Captain.
A nugget failed to show up
for flight instruction.
- l'm sorry to hear that, Captain.
- Maybe you can tell me where Seelix is.
Seelix. Front and centre.
Flight instruction began 20 minutes ago,
Seelix. You wanna be a pilot or not?
- Yes, sir, but l thought that...
- Think when l tell you to think.
Look at the plan of the day -
then you'd know where you're supposed
to be and may actually get there on time.
And you're out of uniform to boot.
- l'm sorry. l think l can handle that.
- Thank you.
Hold this.
You have to be an officer
to fly Vipers.
You know that.
Detail, hand salute.
<i>(chuckling)</i>
Thank you, Chief.
Thank you.
- Congratulations, Ensign.
- Very touching.
But you were supposed to be
in ready room four 20 minutes ago,
which means that you are falling behind
on your first day.
So move it.
Don't look at him!
Move it! Move it!
- Be nice.
- Oh!
More religion.
Your soul is mine.
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>
<i>(Adama) Leoben's a very clever Cylon.</i>
<i>He's gonna try to get into your head.</i>
We haven't been properly introduced.
l'm Leoben.
<i>(Starbuck)</i> l want
the Cylon interrogated.
Do it.
This has happened before.
And all of it will happen again.
Your destiny has already been written.
Assaulted, Miss Thrace.
A lot of old fractures from childhood.
Children of abusive parents often fear
passing that abuse to their own children.
Get out!
l'm trying to help you, Kara. l only want
you to see the truth of your life.
The reason you suffered.
The reason you struggled for so long.
Was there something to what Leoben
said about you and a special destiny?
Kara Thrace and her special destiny?
That sounds like
a bad cover band, Sam.
<i>(Adama) l think the nova does look like</i>
<i>the mandala inside this temple.</i>
Maybe it was a road sign. Show
me the direction it's headed to next.
<i>(Helo) l'm curious about something.</i>
<i>Those paintings you did</i>
<i>from your apartment on Caprica.</i>
This... was on the temple.
Where did you get the idea to paint yours?
That's something l've been doodling
since l was a kid. l liked the pattern.
<i>(Helo) Well... they built the temple</i>
<i>4,000 years ago.</i>
- What is it?
- Just something Leoben said once.
That l had a destiny.
That it had already been written.
What's up?
Nothing. Go back to sleep.
You're up early.
You too.
Yeah.
Hera gets these nightmares.
Wakes up crying and shaking.
By the time we calm her down
and get her to sleep, l'm wide awake.
All that crap she went through on
New Caprica really left its mark on her.
l know how she feels. l wish you'd never
shown me that picture of that mandala.
l dream about it and that bastard Leoben
every godsdamn night.
l feel like l'm losing my mind here.
You know, Kara, there's a, um...
psychiatrist aboard <i>Inchon Velle.</i>
We've made an appointment for Hera.
Think about seeing her.
Are you kidding me? Most shrinks are
more frakked up than their patients are.
You know, you might want to check out
that Oracle camped in Dogsville.
People say she interprets dreams.
Sees things in them. Predicts events.
Hey.
You OK?
l don't know.
Hello? <i>(clears throat)</i>
<i>(woman)</i> The goddess Aurora.
Take it. It's yours.
- What the hell am l gonna do with this?
- You'll know when the time comes.
Sit.
I, uh...
l can't sleep.
- Having these nightmares.
- About the Cylon.
The one who held you captive
on New Caprica.
Leoben.
He was just...
He knows you better than
you know yourself... Kara Thrace.
He sees the truth about you.
About your destiny.
You don't...
Enough of that.
The only destiny l have
is as a world-class frak-up.
Who hurts everyone
she cares about.
That was your mother's gift to you,
wasn't it?
You were born to a woman who believed
suffering was good for the soul,
so you suffered.
<i>Your life is a testament to pain.</i>
You want to believe it because
it means that you're bad luck.
You're like a cancer
that needs to be removed.
<i>Because you hear her voice every day.</i>
<i>(Leoben)</i> And you want her to be right.
Somebody told you
what Leoben said to me.
Did you ever tell anyone about that?
You learned the wrong lesson
from your mother, Kara.
You confused the messenger
with the message.
Your mother was trying
to teach you something else.
You don't know crap
about my mother.
Leoben does.
He sees the patterns,
sees how it all fits together.
- Shut up.
- <i>He's coming for you.</i>
<i>Soon.</i>
Shut the frak up.
You can't stop him.
And he will show you the way.
l'm on a shuttle in a half an hour.
Ask for your leave, come with me.
You could use the downtime.
It sounds tempting.
So do it. No strings, OK? We don't even
have to talk about our relationship.
l'll think about it.
Which means no.
<i>(sighs)</i>
You know, l hate to say this, but that
whack-job oracle... she's got a point.
Your mother frakked up your head
long before Leoben ever got to you.
She was dealing with a lot, Sam.
She told me that l was
different from other kids,
that l needed to be a warrior, like her.
Taught me that fury gets you killed.
And anger keeps you alive.
Well, she gave you plenty
to be angry about, didn't she?
Split your head open with a broom
because you didn't make your bed.
- l ever tell you how l got back at her?
- No.
In the first Cylon war, she was stationed
with the first marines on Medra.
Stinking jungles you wouldn't believe.
Had this phobia of insects
for the rest of her life.
Hated the damn things.
So l go out and l buy a bunch of
rubber bugs and l slip into her closet...
and l put 'em all over her shoes.
And?
She screamed her frakking head off.
l go in...
and she's trying to smash them
with her shoes.
But that's just making 'em
bounce around even more.
You must have caught hell for that.
She grabbed my hand, held it in
the doorjamb, and slammed the door.
Frak me.
It was worth it, though.
<i>(Hotdog) lt's "Galactica". We had some</i>
<i>valve failures. We're restarting the unrep.</i>
<i>(Dualla) Great. Hotdog, settle in. We're</i>
<i>gonna be out for another three hours.</i>
Hotdog, what the hell are you doing?
Enjoying blue skies again. About
the only thing l miss about New Caprica.
<i>Galactica,</i> Starbuck. Showtime.
Bogey. My right one,
in the soup at 45. Committing.
Starbuck, Hotdog. No joy. Press.
Abort the unrep.
Unhook those fuel lines immediately.
Refuelling ships, <i>Galactica.</i> Immediate.
Cease all under-way replenishment ops.
We've got both Starbuck and Hotdog
on DRADIS, but no contact on the bogey.
We're lucky we can see anything.
That planet's synchrotron radiation
has been kicking the crap out of every
DRADIS in the fleet since we got here.
Price you pay for a good place
to hide and refuel the fleet.
Looks like it's also a good place
for hiding a Cylon Raider.
Starbuck, Apollo.
What have you got?
Apollo, we got one turkey playing
hide-and-seek in the clouds. No sparrows.
Engaging offensive.
One heavy Raider.
No fighter escort.
<i>(Gaeta)</i> Still no bandits on DRADIS.
If that bastard jumps,
the Cylons could be all over us in minutes.
Alert the fleet to stand by for a jump.
Starbuck, Hotdog.
No visual on the Raider! l'm losing you!
Dammit. Starbuck, blind!
l say again! l lost you in the clouds!
<i>(Hotdog) Starbuck, we have no DRADIS</i>
<i>on your bogey. Do you have visual?</i>
Affirmative.
He just ducked into the storm system.
<i>(Hotdog) Do you see him?</i>
<i>Do you see him?</i>
<i>Galactica,</i> Starbuck.
Tally. Weapons hot.
<i>Galactica,</i> Starbuck.
Took a hit but still flying.
- <i>(Hotdog) Starbuck, where did you go to?</i>
- <i>l'll be on him in a few seconds.</i>
- Where the hell is that Raider?
- <i>(Gaeta)</i> Sir.
Starbuck's close to the hard deck.
The atmospheric density could
keep her from reaching orbit again.
Then the pressure will crush her
like a cheap soda can.
<i>(Apollo) Starbuck, you're getting too low.</i>
<i>Break off and climb.</i>
<i>l repeat. Starbuck, you're getting too low.</i>
<i>Break off and climb.</i>
<i>Starbuck.</i>
Pull out before you don't have
to smash to regain orbit.
<i>You got to come in.</i>
Where the hell is she going?
Get outta there.
<i>(Apollo) Starbuck, come in. Do you read?</i>
<i>You're getting too low.</i>
- Get up.
- <i>(Apollo) Have you a visual on Starbuck?</i>
<i>Starbuck, come in! Do you read?</i>
<i>Starbuck! Pull up!</i>
That is an order. Pull out!
Apollo, Starbuck. Wilco!
Come on!
- Where'd l take the hits, Chief?
- Looks like nowhere, Captain.
What? l felt the impact.
Damn Viper felt like
it hit a brick wall.
Well, we'll keep checking,
but so far not a scratch.
<i>(Starbuck)</i> It has to be there.
Run it again.
- We've watched it twice.
- Then this isn't my film.
<i>(Sharon)</i> No one else
pulled a trigger all day.
We checked <i>Galactica's</i> DRADIS records.
There was no paint on your Cylon.
And we all know that DRADIS
can be wonky near this planet.
Maybe the Raider jumped away
before you fired.
Or maybe it never existed
to begin with.
It was there.
Gonna ground her?
Karl says she's physically fit,
but an emotional basket case.
In peacetime, he'd ground us all.
So it falls back on you.
Yeah.
Even screwed up,
she's still the best Viper driver l've got.
Sometimes it's hard to admit
that the best of us... can burn out.
Do you think she has?
l don't know.
l think her identity as a steely-eyed Viper
jock is the only thing holding her together.
So if l ground her...
Everyone gets rattled sometimes.
But the bottom line is...
when the bullets start to fly...
can she handle it?
So where do you want to go
when you bite the big one?
l want to go right there.
Next to Kat.
A water-walking Viper jock.
A royal pain in the ass,
but a hell of a stick to have on your wing.
You can put me right here.
Next to Duck and Nora.
Good card players.
Nice way to spend eternity.
Whoever croaks first, the other one makes
sure their picture goes in the right place.
Deal?
Deal.
So what did the old man have to say
about my combat report?
"Starbuck's finally gone off the deep end.
Unfit for duty."
He said l'm the CAG.
It's my call.
Ah.
And what do you say?
l say l trust your eyes over DRADIS
any day of the week.
Something could have been there,
vanished in the cloud cover.
So you don't think l'm nuts?
l didn't say that.
You're a raving lunatic.
As demented and deranged
as the first day l met you.
And you're a bastard.
Look, um...
stress has made us all twitchy.
After what that Cylon put you through
on New Caprica,
you've had more than your share.
Get some rest...
or you will start seeing things.
Yeah.
<i>(Adama)</i> That leaves
six civvies in line to refuel.
- <i>(Roslin)</i> In another ten hours we're done.
- Yeah.
Starbuck?
- What do you hear?
- Nothing but the rain.
Well, then grab your gun
and bring in the cat.
Wilco, Admiral.
- Madam President.
- Captain. How is it out there?
- Hell of a view.
- <i>(Adama)</i> We're almost to the finish line.
Then we can jump the hell
outta this system.
So say we all.
Um... Actually...
Sorry. Boss.
l have something for you.
l thought that it would be a nice
figurehead for your model ship.
Aurora. Goddess of the dawn.
Yeah. She brings the morning star
and a fair wind.
A fresh start.
Thank you.
- Good hunting.
- Thank you.
<i>(Chief)</i> Harness assembly?
Lap and shoulder retaining pins installed.
Retraction reel correct.
Disconnect block locking indicator,
yellow flag visible.
<i>(gasps)</i>
You all right, Captain?
Uh...
Give me a minute here, Chief.
<i>(screaming)</i>
<i>(Chief)</i> Major.
She's just sitting there.
Did you talk to her?
You talk to her.
Feeling sorry for me?
Kara.
Everyone gets rattled.
Even the best.
l'm not going back out there.
l don't trust myself.
Hm.
So trust me.
l'll fly your wing.
The CAG flying my No.2?
Whatever it takes.
How are things with you and Dee?
Uh...
You know. Good.
No.
Better than good.
Best they've ever been.
l'm happy for you.
Really.
It's funny, though,
after all we've been through...
we are right back where we started.
You're CAG and l am
your hotshot problem pilot.
l guess that's all
we'll ever be now, huh?
Starbuck, Apollo.
How we doing?
Copacetic.
Another 30 minutes
and we head back for the barn.
Dammit. Apollo! One turkey, my right.
Level and ten, ducking in and out
of the clouds. Engaging.
<i>Starbuck, Apollo. No joy.</i>
Starbuck, <i>Galactica.</i>
No DRADIS contact on your Cylon.
<i>Apollo. Starbuck.</i>
Weapons hot. Committing.
This time l'm gonna drag him back and
dump his sorry ass on the hangar deck.
Set the fleet at condition one.
Uncouple the hoses.
Starbuck, Apollo.
l've lost you on DRADIS. l'm blind!
Starbuck, Apollo. l repeat.
l got no sign of you or the Raider.
Starbuck! Report!
Starbuck, report!
<i>This is Apollo.</i>
<i>Can you read me?</i>
<i>Starbuck, we're falling.</i>
<i>Starbuck!</i>
<i>Starbuck, l have zero visibility.</i>
<i>Starbuck, are you out there? Kara!</i>
<i>(beeping)</i>
<i>(beeping continues)</i>
<i>(radio) Good morning.</i>
<i>Got another hot one in store for you today.</i>
<i>It's time to head for the beach.</i>
<i>Weatherman says we can exp...</i>
Rise and shine.
We have a big day ahead of us.
Come on.
l'm not here.
l'm out cold, or on a Cylon ship,
and you dragged me
to play your frakking mind games.
No games, Kara.
This is about your destiny.
l write my own destiny.
l didn't paint that symbol, Kara.
You did.
You saw it again.
In the clouds.
Didn't you?
But you didn't tell anyone else.
Because you're drawn to it.
You feel its pull.
You want to fly into it.
You want to cross over.
But you're afraid.
Afraid of what?
A frakking cloud?
Of the unknown.
Death.
All of your high-wire stunts
have been an act.
Time after time...
you skip to the edge of the abyss,
then dance away again.
But you never really
conquered your fear.
You've been afraid.
Ever since that day.
What day?
All this has happened before.
And will happen again.
<i>(knocking)</i>
- <i>(woman)</i> It's open.
- <i>(door opens)</i>
Hello, Mamma.
It's hard to believe
it's only six years ago.
You look so much younger.
l was.
<i>(mother)</i> So, you really did it. First person
in the family to become an officer.
What <i>is</i> the world coming to?
Kara, they tell me that you're
the best natural pilot they've ever seen.
First time l got in that cockpit, l just...
felt like l belonged.
All that natural ability, and still
you only graduated 16th in your class.
16th out of 117 cadets, Mamma.
Why are you proud of that?
You should have been No.1.
They tell me that you have left a trail
of demerits from here to Aerelon.
- You have no respect for authority...
- It's none of your business any more.
You have a gift, Kara.
l've always known that in my gut. And
l am not going to let you piss that away.
- You're special. Don't you understand?
- No, l'm not.
Would you let go of
that stupid dream of yours?
Look, l am sorry as hell
that you never made officer,
and all you have to show for a life
of dedication is this crappy apartment
and that frakking medal on the wall.
But l will not make up for it all. l can't.
Yeah, because you're a quitter.
You always have been.
You went to an oncologist?
Hey! Put that down.
Don't touch that.
- What are you gonna do about this?
- Nothing.
There's nothing <i>to</i> do.
It's metastasised.
Game is over.
- l'm sorry, Mamma.
- l don't want your pity.
- You haven't got it.
- You want to feel sorry for someone?
Feel sorry for yourself.
You have to find another way to motivate
your ass. l'm not gonna be around to do it.
Oh, don't tell me
you're gonna cry about it now.
You know what? l don't need this.
l'm gonna... l'm gonna walk out that door.
And you can look at it every frakking
miserable day you have left
and know that l am never
gonna come back through it again.
Kara!
Kara!
<i>(door opens)</i>
<i>(door slams)</i>
You kept running, didn't you?
For blocks.
<i>(Leoben)</i> She waited here.
Five weeks.
Hoping you'd come back.
She died alone.
l was afraid l couldn't watch.
It's not too late.
She's waiting still.
Mamma.
You came back.
l can't believe you kept all this.
Everything.
Always.
Mamma.
Something's about to happen.
You know that thing that
you were trying to prepare me for?
l don't know if l can do it.
Oh, yes, you can. You can.
How can you be sure?
You're my daughter.
<i>(Leoben)</i> See? There's nothing
so terrible about death.
When you finally face it...
it's beautiful.
You're free now.
To become who you really are.
You're not Leoben.
Never said l was.
l'm here to prepare you
to pass through the next door.
To discover what hovers
in the space between life and death.
<i>(beeping)</i>
<i>Starbuck, Apollo.</i>
<i>l lost you on DRADIS.</i>
<i>l say again... l've lost you.</i>
<i>Switch idents.</i>
<i>l'll try and get a fix on you.</i>
<i>Kara!</i>
<i>(Starbuck) Lee.</i>
<i>l'm not afraid any more.</i>
Say again?
l'm not afraid any more.
She should be afraid.
She's damn close to the hard deck.
The pressure will crush them both.
- Lee, get her out of there.
- <i>(Gaeta)</i> 90 seconds to hard deck.
All right, Kara. Listen to me.
Forget the damn toaster.
Climb now or you're dead.
<i>We can still pull out. We haven't</i>
<i>gone past the point of no return.</i>
<i>Kara!</i>
<i>(Gaeta)</i> 60 seconds to hard deck.
D vector red section to Apollo's last
known. Set alert Vipers to ready one.
<i>(Dualla)</i> Hotdog, Hex, divert to 7.5.
Gods, Starbuck, where are you?!
Visual. Visual.
OK. Kara, l'm coming to get you.
<i>(Starbuck) Lee...</i>
<i>l'll see you on the other side.</i>
<i>Kara, please!</i>
<i>Listen to me! Come back...</i>
Just let me go.
Godsdammit, Kara.
You come back!
<i>Come back!</i>
It's OK. Just let me go.
<i>They're waiting for me.</i>
No!
No!
Apollo! Get out of there!
Abort! Abort!
Lee, do you have her in sight?
Can you see her?
<i>Negative.</i>
<i>She...</i>
<i>she went in.</i>
She went in.
We're sending in the
search and rescue birds. We'll find her.
<i>No, Dad. It's no use.</i>
<i>Her ship's in pieces.</i>
<i>Her ship's in pieces.</i>
<i>No chute.</i>
<i>We lost her.</i>
- l'm a Ronnie monster.
- What's a Ro?
(giggles)
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>
<i>(Roslin)</i> Why don't you do yourself
a favour? Hand over your book.
<i>My Triumphs, My Mistakes</i>
by Gaius Baltar.
The people are reading it,
and now you're sorry.
Baltar will get his trial.
And this is what you'll get - a hurricane.
You will have sectarian violence,
assassination attempts.
You will have civil unrest
on a scale we've never seen.
The president wants
to fast-track Baltar's trial.
She wants someone
to take charge of the preliminaries,
help cobble together the legal framework.
She wants me to assign you.
- <i>(Apollo)</i> My grandfather's law books.
- <i>(Dualla)</i> It's from your father.
Starbuck, Apollo.
l've lost you on DRADIS.
No! No!
Lee. We're sending in the
search and rescue birds. We'll find her.
<i>No, Dad. It's no use.</i>
<i>Her ship's in pieces. We lost her.</i>
<i>(Roslin)</i> Here's every captain
from every ship in the fleet.
Captain Elias Meeker, <i>Gideon.</i>
And the last name for the tribunal is...
Ad...
Gods.
Yeah.
Yeah, l see the resemblance.
<i>(Anders)</i> One more for heads!
Watch.
Heads! You see that?
Four in a row. It's a frakking miracle.
Watch this one more time.
It's gonna be heads.
Watch.
Heads! Every time!
You see that? It's heads.
- Why don't you come down from there?
- l'm just fine right here.
Major?
Yeah.
Heads! You see that?
My girl's too lucky to check out.
Hey, Sam.
Lee.
Apollo.
You stay there, buddy.
You're flying.
- Let's get down and get some sleep.
- l'm just... l'm fine. l need to sit down.
Ow.
You all right?
She wasn't supposed to...
- Come on.
- No. l gotta go.
<i>(Apollo)</i> Frak!
Frak! Is he OK?
- Oh, l think l fell.
- Sam. Sam.
<i>(groans)</i>
She's still alive, right?
She's gone, Sam.
She's gone.
- l know.
- Yeah.
<i>(Hotdog) LSO, Viper six.</i>
<i>Request long approach.</i>
<i>(man)</i> Viper six, LSO.
Viper approved.
Never thought l'd miss
all of Starbuck's yakking.
Yes, sir.
Your Honour.
You haven't heard.
Where you been? They just announced it.
You won the lottery. You now own
exactly 1/5 of Baltar's skinny ass.
You're one of five captains
picked to serve on the judges' tribunal.
<i>(Adama)</i> Hm.
- <i>(Sharon)</i> Here he comes.
- Frak.
It's a waste of my time flying Baltar's
lawyer back and forth from <i>Zephyr.</i>
- Tell me about it.
- Wanna know the worst part?
He sits there and tries to whisper into
my ear when he talks. l've got a helmet.
Sorry.
Mr Hughes.
If he takes his shoes off in my Raptor
again, l might have to kill him.
"Client." Everybody knows he's guilty.
He gave the Cylons our location.
- Why give the son of a bitch a trial?
- Because he's entitled.
- Even him. It's called justice.
- Yeah, right.
To see Baltar dead and Starbuck alive,
that'd be justice.
There's no justice.
As drunk as he was...
Racetrack!
<i>(Cally)</i> Racetrack!
Are you OK?
Yeah, yeah. l got him.
l got him. OK. OK.
<i>(Skulls)</i> You OK?
How do you intend to replace
Baltar's defence attorney?
- Will that be done by lottery as well?
- We'll replace him shortly.
There's a number of candidates. We're
working our way down the list. Next.
In the context of this explosion,
obviously no accident,
do you really think it's wise
to proceed with this trial?
This administration
will never bow to terrorism.
Wait. Let me say something to all of you.
Let me get this clear. All right?
As long as l am president,
this administration will not allow terrorism
to alter the framework of our legal system.
We will proceed with the trial. Rigorously.
- Thank you. All of you.
- One more question!
Helo. l need you to set up a DRADIS picket
with blue squadron at sector seven.
Uh... Excuse me, sir.
You mean sector nine, right?
Uh...
Right. Right. Nine. Um... Yeah.
We scrubbed eight on the last picket.
It's been so quiet,
one picket just flows into the next.
OK. Uh...
81 carom, 22 degrees.
Keep your ears open. Any Cylon contact,
just shut down, bug out.
Red squadron.
You'll be riding first CAP with me.
And from here on, double shifts.
Athena, l'm gonna need you
exclusively on shuttle runs.
Well, don't forget
to check under your back seat.
Hey. Hey. You got lucky, Starbuck.
If l were you, l would seriously consider...
Racetrack. l'm sorry.
Dismissed.
Dismissed.
Well, it's so comforting
to know that you're not afraid.
You're not afraid to represent
the most hated man alive.
The question is why?
For the fame, the glory.
You worked in
the public litigation office on Caprica.
You think you have the qualifications
to handle a case of this magnitude?
l was born for this.
That and the fact l have a pulse.
Lance belonged to my wife.
Don't worry.
He doesn't scratch or bite like she did.
If it's of any comfort, l despise him
as much as you do having to hire me.
So. There it is.
Shall we get started?
l'm gonna need you to handle
the security detail on the new attorney.
Me?
So that's it?
You're grounding me?
- You're the only one l can trust.
- Just say it. You're pulling me.
Keeping Lampkin alive
is an important job. l need your help.
Dad, l'm fine.
- No, you're not.
- Why?
Because l'm not.
Yeah? Well, then,
maybe you should take a rest.
Helo will be stepping in as CAG.
l want you on the ship,
not up there.
Not until you can...
work this out.
All right.
l understand.
Work it out.
OK.
l'll be handling security for you.
Where do you want your bags?
You'll have two marines
outside the door.
Ms Cassidy, the prosecuting attorney,
she's just down the hall.
Shower's that way.
Sorry, co-ed.
Now, if there's anything else...
l'd like to see my client.
Now?
- Pilot.
- Yeah.
King of the pilots.
We could stand around here and discuss
why you got stuck with me if you want.
- l'll take you to his cell.
- No. Half the ship's probably listening in.
Fine. We have an interrogation room.
Interrogation rooms
give me stage fright.
- l can't bring him here.
- l was thinking your quarters.
- What?
- Before it gets wired for sound.
What's the problem?
Forgot to make your bed?
Look, l don't care where you see him.
l just can't leave you alone.
Major.
It is Major, isn't it?
l have the right
to consult with my client in private,
without anybody eavesdropping
or looking in.
Whoever cares the most... wins.
Says so in there.
So?
l want to see my client.
You don't care. l win.
You know, you look like him.
You knew my grandfather?
Hated his guts.
He taught me everything l know.
<i>(beeps)</i>
- What are you doing here, anyway?
- You can speak freely.
He's signed confidentiality papers.
This whole charade's pathetic.
Pathetic.
Security? Security is already toasting
my other attorney's untimely demise.
About the only thing that bloke ever did
apart from napping was... manage to...
smuggle out my papers.
Papers!
Do you have any papers?
Thank you.
The nature...
of modern life...
is... obsession.
So, tell me...
do you honestly think
that l'm gonna get a fair trial?
- Doubtful.
- Yes.
But you haven't exactly
been helping yourself, now, have you?
- You object to my writing.
- On the contrary. Keep it coming.
This new manifesto of yours
shows great change in you.
This little, uh, operating manual of yours,
well... it keeps them all guessing.
OK. OK.
Caprica Six.
l'm worried about her. She's the key.
They can use her
to completely destroy me.
l need to get to her.
l need to know what she's thinking.
And you need to...
l mean, talk to her.
Tell her... uh...
Tell her l love her very much.
l'm thinking about her a lot.
l can sense that, yes.
You need to find out
where we're all standing.
"To listen requires a voice, for what
needs to be known requires us to ask."
<i>My Triumphs, My Mistakes</i>
by Gaius Baltar.
- But you say it very well.
- l've done my reading.
Once those papers arrive,
l suggest you do yours.
Fly me to <i>Colonial One.</i>
- Me?
- Yeah. You're a pilot, aren't you?
You can't just jump in a Raptor.
It has to be coordinated.
Where would you rather be, Major? Here?
As the parade float for the bereaved?
- What are you talking about?
- People look at you like you're bleeding.
You wanna to see some real blood?
Keep going.
Oh, there <i>is</i> someone home.
Look, l need those files. You come
with me, they might just give them to me.
l wait, they're gonna discover
that Baltar's pregnant before l get them.
What is your job, anyway? To keep me
alive? Or to keep me from doing mine?
Sorry, sir. You know your status. You're
to remain shipside. Admiral's orders.
The father factor.
Come on, Kelly.
Give me a break. l'm along for the ride.
Don't do this to me. All right?
l'm in enough dung already.
All right.
<i>(beeps)</i>
All right,
let's give the bird a tow.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up!
Open the door!
What the frak was that thing?
Did you see that?
- What?
- l think it was a cat!
There's a cat in there!
Come out of there, Major!
- <i>(Kelly)</i> Who the hell let a cat in here?
- <i>(Chief)</i> On the other side. Push him here.
There it is.
It's over there.
There it is. There it is. Here it is.
Here, kitty, kitty. No, no, no. Come on.
- Come here, kitty. Come here.
- <i>(beeping)</i>
Bomb! Bomb!
Everybody out!
What the hell were you doing out there?
l gave you an order to do a job.
- Excuse me. l was doing my job.
- Yeah. Being led around by the nose?
This bastard yanks your chain
and you jump.
- He wanted files from <i>Colonial One.</i>
- It was the middle of the night.
- You assigned me to security.
- Yeah.
And there was a bomb on that ship
and you missed it.
Security.
l gave you explicit orders.
Athena was piloting.
You could have died.
Plain and simple.
You're a soldier.
Live like one.
Start acting like one.
She's been gone two weeks.
l didn't know the clock was running.
- Stop.
- Sorry. Maybe we're just built differently.
You stop.
Don't you dare quantify my loss.
You have no idea.
You have no frakking idea.
- You think yours is deeper?
- Wow.
Yours is greater?
In two weeks,
there's going to be a trial.
And l'm gonna do
what l was chosen to do, and so are you.
You build a frakking nest
around this man
and you protect his ass.
Frakker meant business this time.
If that had gone off, we'd be
picking up people parts with tweezers.
Every day l wave jocks out there.
A lot of them are my friends.
People l care for and love. It's hard
enough watching them die in battle.
But rickshawing Baltar's
frakking attorney around? Frak that.
l believe the Cylons want us to destroy
ourselves, and this is how they're doing it.
They're planting bombs,
making us suspicious of each other.
Know what? By the time the Cylons catch
up with us, they won't even have to attack.
They'll just clean up the mess we made.
I... l think they're here.
l think you're wrong.
l kissed Nicky this morning.
It could have been the last time.
- Cally. That's enough.
- What? l kissed you, too.
Some of us
don't get a second chance.
Or a third.
l'm going to the admiral.
Take a good look at this room.
Every time you leave, memorise it.
If anything changes,
don't touch it.
Uh... a book moves,
shoes in the wrong place,
something smells different,
you get the frak out.
Someone knocks, don't answer the door.
Don't open the door.
Look, you have to do what do l say.
If they wanna kill me,
they'll find a way.
Now, who do l have to bribe
to see the Cylon woman?
"The nature of modern life
is obsession."
l can't find my glasses.
It's like they've got feet.
The Six. Yes. OK.
Lampkin can interview Six immediately,
if it's conducted under the conditions
accorded to the chief prosecutor.
Meaning in the interrogation room,
not where you sleep.
Of course. But since you've been selected
to serve on the tribunal,
l'm assuming that you won't be present
at those interviews.
- The major has a point, Bill.
- The major is mistaken.
l monitored
the chief prosecutor's interview.
Therefore, the same conditions apply,
in the interests of fairness.
Mr Lampkin is entitled to the documents
he requested from <i>Colonial One.</i>
Yes. Right. l apologise.
We've had trouble locating the files.
We'll have them delivered to you
on the next run.
l'm sorry, Major. We'll get them to you
right away. Thank you.
Thank you.
<i>(Lampkin) l understand you had</i>
<i>a romantic relationship with my client.</i>
Gaius Baltar is a brilliant,
gifted human being.
In the time l've known him, he's made
a sport out of mendacity and deception.
He was narcissistic, self-centred, vain.
l'm the one who should have stabbed him.
- Things are looking up.
- <i>(Lampkin) Love.</i>
A precocious evolutionary move,
fashioning Cylons to experience it.
l don't know if it was engineered
as a tactical imperative, but...
- It's not for the faint-hearted, is it?
- No, it's not.
Maybe you should have been nicer
to your mechanic.
Well, perhaps Cylon love
is not the same as human love.
Perhaps it's designed
to hurt a little less.
- How would you know?
- l loved a woman.
Beautiful, beautiful woman.
But so serious.
This frowning face
trapped in the middle of a daisy.
She had a way of walking.
Processional, as if she were
on her way to her own execution.
We had ten years.
- Then it fell apart under its own weight.
- Is that what you wanted?
l thought if l could get over her,
l could get over anything.
l could endure,
conquer, be a man.
Stand up to any and all kind
of punishment.
l clung to an empty,
spinning bed for months.
And that...
that is when l finally realised
how much l loved her.
If l needed all that strength,
what was the point?
l needed to be with her.
Did he... ask about me?
Gaius?
He wanted to know
if you were well.
He wanted you to know
that he misses you,
loves you.
Because he can't be here to tell you,
he gave me this to give to you.
He uses that, at the risk of grave reprisal,
to express his feelings,
to put his world into
some kind of recognisable order.
To be heard.
<i>He's kept it hidden</i>
<i>because he knows he will not get another.</i>
He wants you to have it
because, without you,
it has no meaning.
He wants you to have it
because he would do anything -
<i>anything</i> -
to be with you again.
Well, that's a shame, isn't it?
Since they'll never let me keep it.
You understand that your days are owned
by these people, the ones watching us?
<i>l think you realise</i>
<i>what's likely to become of you.</i>
<i>l couldn't help you if they paid me</i>
<i>ten times what they offered me for Baltar.</i>
You won't get a trial,
not even a bad one.
So...
l have to ask you.
Does your love
hurt as much as mine?
Yes.
l feel like part of our world
just fell down.
- Hey, guys.
- Yes, sir.
Why encourage the man to write,
and then take his pen?
He'll curry more sympathy when we
get the word out that he's been silenced.
Tyranny.
Gag orders. Very sexy.
OK. All right.
So you steal his pen,
then you lie to him, then you lie to the Six.
The horror of the age.
The great, ugly material.
The cloak of deceit.
The truth.
Kind of overrated, l guess.
You know,
when l was nine, maybe ten,
my grandfather...
he would wave me over.
And he'd do this all the time.
And then he'd say:
"Lee, be a good boy."
"Just don't be too good."
Everybody has demons.
Them, Baltar, you, me.
Even the machines.
The law is just a way of exorcising them.
That's what your father's father taught me.
Wanna know why l hated him?
Because he was right.
You hated him because he was right.
l hated the law because it was wrong.
Because of what...
of what it put him through.
l mean, he defended
the worst of the worst.
l remember reading about him.
The outrage -
helping murderers go free.
What l don't understand is
why he put himself through all that abuse.
You think he gave a flying frak?
Joe Adama cared about one thing -
understanding
why people do what they do.
Why we cheat our friends.
Why we reward our enemies.
Why we go to war,
sacrificing our lives for lost causes.
Why we build machines in the hope of
correcting our flaws and shortcomings.
Why we forgive -
defying logic
and the laws of nature
with one stupid little act of compassion.
We're flawed.
All of us.
l wanted to know why.
So l did what he did.
l spend my life with the fallen,
the corrupt, the damaged.
You were ready to get on that Raptor
with me, be the bad boy, the prodigal son.
- l was just doing my job. Protecting you.
- What are you doing in my business?
Suddenly l'm handcuffed
to a serial contrarian.
No, l am not...
OK.
My bed is made.
l suggest you toil on your own.
Now, if this cross-examination is over,
l'd like to take a crap.
Romo, that story you told about the girl -
the woman - that you loved,
and getting over her, is it true?
Hey! Was it true?
Yes.
For him.
Files from <i>Colonial One.</i>
Finally. l thought l'd get all these
after the trial.
Hold it.
Put that on the floor, now.
Oh, for frak's sake. l was there
when Kelly X-rayed 'em. It's papers.
There you go.
Good?
Yeah.
No!
<i>(guard)</i> You have five minutes, Major.
Thank you.
Before the hounds got to it.
Open it.
The president's glasses.
She looks better without them.
Less serious.
Serious catches on
in the courtroom.
Your father's.
When?
From the deck. Right after you found
the bomb underneath the Raptor.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Ow.
- It was hanging by a thread.
- They tarnish so fast.
It was like that when l plucked it.
Everybody else - Tigh, the others, you -
all shiny.
The soldier in him
has had enough for a while.
He'll be glad to sit in that courtroom
and fire his missiles there.
Ms Prosecuting Attorney
down the hall.
It's not what you think. It was appropriated
with the noblest of intentions.
See, the soles...
See how the soles are worn.
She drags her feet.
You're catching on.
And the rest?
What's all this?
My demons.
l borrow things.
My parents disappeared
when l was nine years old.
They were kidnapped.
Murdered for... for the money
they had on them, which wasn't enough.
l went to live with an uncle.
Stole from him until l could run away.
So what did you take from me?
Hm. l was thinking,
the photograph that you carry.
Of the girl. The pilot.
The one you carry on you.
But... you've had enough
stolen from you already.
l'll try and get these back to her...
somehow.
The other pocket.
At the back.
The guards took it from her.
l borrowed it from them.
l still have a case...
pending.
If you want to help -
if you dare to help -
get this to my client.
- A case?
- l have a calling.
Yeah. So the ringing in my ears tells me.
OK. You better explain this.
- Don't even know what it is.
- Well, l do. Where did you get it?
The one who scolded you
like a schoolboy.
Frakking with your head.
Whatshisname, Mr Serious...
Uh...
Kelly.
- Kel... Kelly?
- Yeah.
l never would have let Athena go airborne
with you in the Raptor.
- l would have stopped it. You know that.
- Yeah, l know that.
You better lock me up.
And l don't want any trial.
l won't stop.
l will keep trying.
l'll keep at it. l will.
l did my job, sir.
And l have done my job
for two years now.
Every day,
l sent people out to fight.
l cleared them all to die.
So many people.
l just got tired of living with that.
If you asked that man
if he had to choose...
between giving his life up
for a Cylon or a human,
what do you think he would say?
l had to do something.
XO.
Reinstate Major Adama
as commander of the air group.
Effective immediately.
- It's good to have you back.
- Thank you.
l'm sorry. l guess l was wrong.
l made it worse.
- No.
- No, you should be in your bird.
l think l should be with Lampkin.
Well, now that we know that it was Kelly,
we can ease up a little bit on security.
In his condition, Lampkin needs help
preparing the trial, presenting his case.
The president has a few possibilities.
She's looking.
Dad, why not me?
l'm close to the case.
l've read the documents.
- l understand Lampkin's strategy.
- We have things under control.
Lampkin will have help.
- l wanna do this.
- You're a CAG.
You're not a lawyer.
Far from it.
And you're a judge?
No. But like the four other men picked,
l'm capable of listening to the evidence
and making an ethical decision.
And l'm capable of helping Lampkin.
Forget it.
l need you as CAG.
Why did you give me those books? Huh?
- You gave me your father's law books.
- l made a mistake.
- Why? Are you afraid that l'll be like him?
- You're a pilot.
With Zak gone and Kara gone,
you need someone to carry the flag?
You're a pilot and you're my son.
l will not look across that court
and see you sitting on the other side.
See me?
Or see someone else?
Report for duty.
Is that an order?
You're in way over your head.
Report for duty.
Is that an order?
l'm through giving you orders.
Remove Apollo from the board.
Inform Helo he's to remain at CAG.
My son has more important things
to tend to.
Hey, how's the leg?
You mean my lucky break?
It gave me a reason
not to come up here.
Sooner or later,
you run out of excuses.
<i>(Apollo)</i> It's hard to let her go.
Lee.
l'll see you around.

where we were gonna be.
- l want to explain.
- She sold us out.
You know what has to be done here. It
would be better for her sake if it was you.
<i>(sobs)</i>
You're not afraid to represent
the most hated man alive?
l'd like to see my client.
If they wanna kill me, they'll find a way.
No!
<i>(Adama) Baltar's defence will need help.</i>
Dad, why not me? l'm close to the case.
l've read the documents.
You're a CAG.
You're not a lawyer.
l will not allow you
to sit across the courtroom,
on the other side,
defending Gaius Baltar.
- Is that an order?
- l'm through giving you orders.
<i>(child laughs)</i>
Hera?
Hera!
We got <i>Greenleaf</i> s FTL nailed down.
So fleet's ready to jump again.
How many more
before we find the nebula?
l'm estimating an even dozen.
We're getting close.
Still no sign of the Cylons.
No. We've left a trailing bird
at every jump site.
No DRADIS contacts,
no sightings, nothing.
Alter the orders of the trailing Raptor.
Tell them to remain six hours
before catching up with the fleet.
<i>(Gaeta)</i> Yes, sir.
<i>(static)</i>
<i>(Skulls)</i> Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!
You're up, superstar.
You know this game has frak all
to do with the real thing?
<i>(Skulls)</i> l didn't hear you
say that in the beginning.
<i>(static continues)</i>
<i>(brief snatch of music)</i>
- There. Go back. You almost had it.
- <i>(Seelix)</i> Had what?
That song.
You don't hear that song?
No. Come on.
You're up. Let's go.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Baltar was instrumental
in the Cylon attack on the Colonies.
The president wants him
charged with genocide.
l can't make it stick.
There's no evidence of his involvement.
The president saw him with one of
the Sixes on Caprica. Before the attacks.
You want me to put Roslin on the stand
to testify about her drug-induced visions?
What we want is for you to do your job
and convict him.
If you can't,
we'll find someone who will.
This is a courtesy meeting,
not a strategy session.
l am charging Baltar
with what l can prove.
l do serve at the pleasure of the president
and if <i>she</i> decides to replace me
l'm sure there are other lawyers
willing to take up the case.
If there are any other lawyers.
Dr Baltar?
Who are you?
Oh.
l'm under instructions from my attorney
not to speak to any members of the press.
Oh. No, Dr Baltar,
I... l want you to look at this picture.
This is my son. He's sick
and l want you to bless him.
Bless him?
- Guard! l'm terribly sorry, madam.
- Please.
l can't help you. l'm not God, the God,
or a god of any derivation thereof.
- Please. I...
- Sorry. l don't have any special powers.
- l believe in you. Just please take it.
- Well, that's very flattering.
- Please, will you just take it? Please.
- l'm on trial for my life. l need privacy.
- Please.
- l'll do my best.
- You can save him.
- Yeah. Mind how you go, now.
How many is that now?
Five. Not including the 30 or 40
who've written letters.
Well, l suppose it can't be helped.
Celebrity trials invariably
bring out the crazies.
So, you think they're crazy?
You see, l saw a woman in pain.
l saw a woman who can see you
more clearly than you can see yourself.
Even if they kill you,
your name will live on forever.
<i>(Racetrack) Galactica, Raptor 289. We're</i>
<i>clear and in position for rearguard picket.</i>
<i>(Tigh) Roger, 289.</i>
<i>Have fun watching our ass, Racetrack.</i>
Have fun watching
Baltar's ass get nailed.
All right, get comfortable.
12 hours and counting.
12 hours hanging out here
like bait on a hook
waiting to see if the Cylons
are still following us.
Just shut up and deal, OK?
How do we measure loss?
How do we measure loss?
We measure it in the faces of the dead.
The faces that haunt our memories
and our dreams.
How do we measure loss?
We measure it in our own faces,
the ones we see
in the mirror every day,
because it has marked each of us.
So, how do we measure loss?
When the scale of it becomes too hard
to absorb any other way,
we use numbers.
How many killed. How many maimed.
How many missing.
And when those numbers
become too vast to comprehend,
as they did two years ago,
we had to turn it around.
We began to count the living,
those of us who survived
to continue the saga of the human race.
44,035 -
the sum total of survivors from the Twelve
Colonies who settled on New Caprica
with President Gaius Baltar
as their leader and protector.
38,838 -
our number
the day after we escaped.
And the missing number?
The one that no one wants to face?
5,197.
5,197 of us killed,
left behind, or simply disappeared.
5,197 of all that remains
of the human race...
Iost.
<i>The citizens of the Twelve Colonies</i>
<i>entrusted their fate and their lives</i>
<i>to Gaius Baltar.</i>
<i>What we received was a reign of terror</i>
<i>that staggers our minds</i>
<i>and breaks our hearts.</i>
<i>Instead of governance,</i>
<i>we got tyranny.</i>
<i>Instead ofjustice,</i>
<i>we got oppression.</i>
<i>Instead of a president,</i>
<i>we got a murderer.</i>
<i>Today, humanity holds him</i>
<i>accountable for his crime.</i>
Gaius Baltar is not a victim.
Gaius Baltar chose
to side with the Cylons
and to actively seek the deaths
of his fellow citizens.
For that,
he must pay the ultimate price.
Your Honours, the defence would like
to change our plea to guilty.
What? Counsellor,
are you sure you want to do that?
No. But what choice do l have?
l mean, it's obvious my client is guilty.
He's a traitor, a killer. He's no better than
a Cylon, and what do we do with them?
- <i>(man)</i> Throw 'em out the airlock!
- That's right. Throw 'em out the airlock.
This man sold us to our enemy.
This man <i>is</i> our enemy.
And if there's one thing that's good
in war, that is right and just and proper,
it's slaughtering our enemy!
Getting some righteous payback!
What are we waiting for?!
Let's just kill him now!
It'd be easier, wouldn't it?
Simpler.
Justice of the mob.
It's what they want.
Especially her.
She's been wanting this
for over a year now.
Ever since he beat her
in a free and fair election of the people.
Now she gets the chance
to exact her revenge
upon a man whose only real crime
is bowing to the inevitable.
Gaius Baltar saved the lives
of the people on New Caprica
where Laura Roslin
would have seen us all dead,
victims of a battle
we had no hope in winning.
l don't know about you,
but l'm glad she wasn't the president
when the Cylons arrived
and said, "Surrender or die."
l owe my life to Gaius Baltar
and the decision he made that day.
And so does Laura Roslin.
- Yeah, like you'd frakking know.
- l know you wank it in your rack,
ladies' man.
You see, that's called self-healing.
- OK. Time check.
- <i>(beeping)</i>
Oh, we got something.
Lots of company.
Reading five baseships.
Crap! They're right on top of us.
- Frak. Frak! Incoming!
- The FTL's still spinning up.
We gotta jump.
Now, godsdammit! Now!
Search the entire fleet
for tracking devices.
It's possible they could have placed one
on a ship on New Caprica.
l think that we should ask the Six.
She may be willing to help.
Baltar's girlfriend?
Why would she do that?
Because she does not want to see Hera
go back to the Cylons.
You think that thing would stick
her neck out for some half-Cylon whelp?
l have a feeling
she'd lay her life down for her.
A feeling?
It's more than a feeling, all right?
Just do it!
It doesn't hurt to ask.
No.
Ask the prisoner if it knows
of any tracking devices in the fleet.
With pleasure.
The president,
gods bless her sunny, optimistic soul,
thinks you might wanna share
how your buddies have been tracking us.
So l'm here to ask the question
and listen to your lies.
In the last battle, we discovered your
fuel ship had a unique radiation signature.
They must have found
a way to track it.
What else do you know?
What other secrets are rattling around
inside that mechanical brain?
Don't be intimidated by him.
He's just using you
to exorcise his own pain.
Poor old sod.
He lost someone close to him.
You know how that feels, don't you?
l know a lot of things.
You wanna know one thing l know?
l know about your loss.
It hurts, doesn't it?
You wonder
how you can even survive it.
l don't know what you're talking about,
but it's not gonna work.
<i>(Baltar)</i> She was his world.
Of course, he only realised
when she was gone.
Did she know?
Did she know?
Did she know how much
she meant to you?
Or did you wait to tell her
until she was gone?
What?
But you made her think
that she was a burden.
A millstone around your neck.
But then, you humans always destroy
the ones who love you, don't you?
Shackle this thing.
<i>(lawyer)</i> Colonel Tigh?
Colonel Tigh?
Excuse me.
What was the question, again?
As the leader of the insurgency,
did you ever hear of an instance
when Baltar stood up to the Cylons
or tried to disrupt their plans?
Oh, no, never.
He never lifted a frakking finger to help us.
Ellen did more.
At least she was trying to...
<i>(slurs words)</i> to help us.
My gods, he's drunk.
Yes.
Yes, Ellen. Your wife.
Another victim of Baltar's Cylon allies.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah.
Thank you, Colonel.
Your witness.
- What happened to his wife?
- She worked for a Cylon administrator.
Worked for him?
You know what happened to her?
No. No idea. l presume she died
in the exodus from New Caprica.
- Colonel?
- Hm.
You dislike Gaius Baltar because
you consider him to be a traitor. Correct?
And a coward and a mass murderer.
The suicide bombing
of the police graduation.
Baltar was the intended target,
was he not?
If he'd had the guts to show up that day
like he was supposed to,
you and l wouldn't be having
this conversation now.
So you ordered the killing of -
what was it? - 33 other men and women
just for the chance
to kill Gaius Baltar.
They were all traitors -
anyone who put on that uniform.
But, yes. He was the target.
What happened to your wife?
- Exception. Relevance?
- The door was opened on direct.
- l fail to see the point of pursuing...
- He's right, Admiral.
If it was brought up during direct
examination, it can be pursued in cross.
Overruled. Continue.
- What happened to your wife, Colonel?
- You frakking son of a bitch.
Isn't it true that she collaborated
openly with the Cylons?
That she actually worked for them?
She was faking it.
Making them think
that she was working for them.
l-I see. And Baltar,
he wasn't faking it. No?
That's right.
And you blame him for her death.
Have you been drinking today, Colonel?
l had a drink.
l haven't been drinking.
- You liked to drink with Ellen, l imagine.
- <i>(static)</i>
<i>(haunting music)</i>
Did you hear that?
They're playing music in here now?
What the hell is he talking about?
Gaius Baltar didn't order
the death of your wife.
Colonel, that was somebody else.
Who was it, Colonel?
Who killed Ellen?
Come on, Colonel.
We're waiting. Tell us.
Who was it?
Who killed Ellen?
l did.
l did.
l did.
She was giving information
to the Cylons.
A lot of good men died.
She was my wife, it was my responsibility.
She did it for me.
That's what she said.
To save me from going back to prison
so they could tear more pieces off me.
So l killed her.
All because of that thing over there.
All because Gaius frakking Baltar didn't
have the guts to stand up to the Cylons.
Because he handed our fates
over to the Cylons,
l had to kill my Ellen.
So Gaius Baltar made you kill your wife.
That's why you hate him,
and that's why you'd say anything
to see him die.
You're godsdamn right, l would.
l would do anything,
say anything,
to see that man die a painful death.
No further questions.
<i>(static/haunting music)</i>
Will someone turn off that music?!
<i>(radio) Earlier today,</i>
<i>eight protesters were arrested...</i>
- Are you hearing anything l'm saying?
- <i>(laughs)</i>
My gods.
- What can l get you?
- Uh, l don't know what l want.
- You figure it out. You're the bartender.
- OK. Tell you what. l'll surprise you.
- <i>(Anders)</i> Yes! Finally!
- Thank you! <i>(laughs)</i>
l'm not a bad coach, huh?
<i>(static)</i>
<i>(haunting music)</i>
- One more time.
- Yep.
l was grading papers in the schoolhouse
that night and they came again.
Fortunately, the children were gone.
It was after dark.
They took close to 200 of our people
that night, under Baltar's direct orders.
As it turned out, all of our names
were on a death list signed by Dr Baltar.
Let us be crystal clear on this fact.
You are saying that the defendant,
Gaius Baltar,
ordered your execution
and the execution of 200 other people?
Yes. Indeed.
That's exactly what l'm saying.
We need to talk.
<i>(Baltar)</i> We need to find something
to discredit her testimony.
She's a fanatic, right?
And l don't know if that's gonna happen.
- You're awfully quiet.
- l was just listening.
You see, your problem is is that
l'm a really good liar and you're not.
- So let's have it.
- Have what?
He's right. You do know something. You
know something and you're not saying.
- It's probably not true.
- l like it.
l doubt she would say anything
in front of me.
She? She? This is about Laura Roslin?
And you're not tell... Tell me!
Shut up.
Enjoying yourself so far, huh?
Having a good time sticking it to
the old man, defending a hated man?
- That's not why l agreed to do this.
- You just decided to stand up for justice
and those other things
we inscribe upon courtroom doors?
Yeah. That's exactly what l'm doing,
because l believe in the system.
l really believe. l even believe
that our lowlife pond scum of a client
actually deserves a fair trial.
The system requires
that you tell what you know,
which leaves you with
one of two uncomfortable options.
First, share the information,
and in so doing,
uphold the very principles
that you claim to hold so dear.
Or second, keep 'em to yourself
and prove once and for all
your only purpose here
is to jab your father in the eye and make
a mockery of the justice system.
Very, very nice.
But l know why l'm here. l don't need
to prove it to you or to anyone.
You're wrong. You need to prove it
to yourself. Or you'll leave that courtroom
knowing you kept a secret that could
have saved that man's miserable life.
Unless l misjudge you,
that's not something that Lee Adama
wishes on his conscience.
So, what'll it be, Major?
Sit on the sidelines mouthing pieties,
or are you gonna get in this trial
and give us something we can use?
There we go. We made it.
- Come on.
- <i>(groans)</i>
There we go. Come on.
- Come on. There we go.
- <i>Oh. (coughs)</i>
There we go.
<i>(mumbles)</i> You've had enough of that.
l know. l know.
- l'm all right.
- Attaboy.
Got some good news today.
We found the radiation signature
on the tylium ship
like the Cylon prisoner said we would.
Good. That's great.
It's being repaired as we speak.
Mr Gaeta estimates the fleet's
nine jumps away from the nebula.
Considering how long
it's gonna take to fix the tylium ship,
we're out maybe three days.
Three days out
from the next clue
on the road to Earth.
l can't smell her.
l can't smell her any more, Bill.
l kept her clothes...
but her smell is gone now.
<i>(sighs)</i>
l gotta go, Saul.
l'm really tired.
l'm really sorry about all that in court.
- There's nothing to be sorry about.
- l embarrassed you. Made you look bad.
You're my oldest friend, Saul.
You never embarrass me.
Get some rest.
Can the former CAG make
a radical suggestion to the admiral?
What if we don't fix the tylium ship?
- Repairs have already started.
- l realise that, but hear me out.
We're too close to the nebula to hope
the Cylons can't guess where we're going.
So if we don't fix it, if we send the ship off
on a new course with a couple of Raptors,
let her make a few jumps before rejoining
the fleet, it might throw the Cylons off.
It's a good idea.
l'll take it into consideration.
Is there anything else?
- How's the president?
- What?
Is she OK? She looked
a little rattled in court yesterday.
<i>(sighs)</i>
We can't talk about the trial outside
of court. You know that, or you should.
l know. l wasn't asking...
After what you did to Tigh, you're the last
person l would consider to confide in.
Me? l didn't do anything to Tigh.
He was drunk.
That's really not my fault.
You told Lampkin about Ellen.
l didn't even know about Ellen.
Yeah, right.
Are you calling me a liar?
l'm calling you a liar and a coward,
one who doesn't have the guts
to go after a man himself.
Instead, you hand
the shiv to a stranger
and let him stab Tigh in the back.
And for what?
The traitorous piece of garbage
Gaius Baltar
who doesn't even deserve a trial.
Are you done?
Yes.
Then so am I.
l will not serve under a man
who questions my integrity.
And l won't have an officer under
my command who doesn't have any.
l'll see you in court, Admiral.
- Let me do this.
- <i>(Baltar)</i> What?
Are you sure, Major?
It's "Mr" now.
And yeah, l'm sure. It should be me.
- You're not gonna let my security guard...
- <i>(Franks)</i> We're waiting, Mr Lampkin.
If it please the court, my associate
Mr Adama will question the witness.
His associate.
- The defence may proceed.
- <i>(Lampkin)</i> Thank you.
Aren't you alive today
because of Gaius Baltar?
l'm alive today because the insurgents
managed to stop the execution.
They saved you
from a Cylon firing squad,
but wasn't it Baltar who saved your life
when you were dying from cancer?
Relevance?
Um... Your Honours...
Hostile witness, Your Honours.
If the court would grant us
just a little latitude...
We'll allow it.
Thank you. Um...
Did Gaius Baltar save your life
when you were dying from cancer?
Dr Baltar's scientific knowledge
did save my life, indeed.
Can you be more specific? How did
he save your life on that occasion?
He injected me with the blood
of a half-Cylon, half-human baby.
And your cancer vanished?
Completely.
During your illness,
what sort of medication were you on?
l was taking
a lot of medications at the time
and l don't remember all their names.
Did you take something
called chamalla extract?
Hm.
Yes.
Isn't it true that one of the side effects
of taking chamalla
is a propensity
to experience hallucinations?
Yes, that is one of the possible
side effects of chamalla.
And isn't it also true
that the visions that you once described
as messages from the gods
were actually the result
of a pharmacological reaction
from taking chamalla?
The chamalla enabled me to see
things foretold by the scriptures,
things that will help this fleet
find its way to Earth.
- You of all people should know that.
- Your Honours?
- Where are you going with this?
- Just one more question, Your Honour.
<i>(whispers)</i> Please, don't do this.
Please.
Madam President, are you taking
chamalla at this time?
"Captain Apollo."
You remember that?
l always thought that had such a nice ring
to it. l am so, so sorry for you now.
Chamalla, Madam President.
Perhaps dissolved in your tea
to mask the bitterness.
Don't answer.
l'm putting a stop to this now.
If she is on drugs
it goes to her credibility as a witness.
Witness is dismissed.
Your Honours, l have to object.
He's trying to cover something up here.
One more word
and you'll be held for contempt.
- Admiral!
- l'd like to hear the witness answer.
As would I.
Madam President,
are you taking chamalla again?
Yes, l am.
No further questions.
Mr Adama, aren't you going
to ask me why?
- l'm sorry?
- Why am l taking chamalla again?
- It's not strictly relevant.
- Perhaps not to you, but it is to me.
Go ahead. Ask me why.
Finish what you started.
Why are you taking the chamalla again,
Madam President?
l am taking chamalla again
because my cancer has returned.
The fact that she's having hallucinations
is relevant to Baltar's defence.
That's the way the system works, Dee.
The accused has a right to challenge
the credibility of witnesses against them.
The system is broken, Lee.
The system elected that man to be
president and it's trying to let him walk.
That system doesn't deserve
to be defended, but taken apart
and put back together again.
You know, l wish...
- l wish l could make you understand.
- l do understand, Lee.
That's why l'm leaving.
No, you don't.
You frakking don't.
How long have you known
about the cancer?
- About a week.
- And how advanced is the disease?
Will you be getting more transfusions
from the half-Cylon donor?
This is detail l'm not going into now. l'll let
you know when we have a game plan.
How will the treatment
impact your duties as president?
- So far, it hasn't at all.
- Are you currently taking chamalla?
Don't answer that.
How often do you hallucinate?
- Enough of this crap. We're done here.
- Tory.
- You can go pick over another carcass.
- Tory! Come here.
l'll see you inside. Thank you.
<i>(laughs)</i> l'm sorry.
Temperatures are running a little high
in the fleet these days.
Who's next? Karen?
Madam President,
how long do you have to live?
How long do you have to live, Karen?
- You handled that well.
- You didn't.
"Pick over another carcass"? As opposed
to mine? That'll look good in the press.
I... l don't even know
why l said that. I...
What is up with you?
You've been off your game for days.
You're distracted, exhausted.
Frankly, you're plain obnoxious.
l just haven't been sleeping very well.
You need to pull it together
and focus on your job fast,
or l can find someone
who can handle the press
as well as pull a comb
through their hair once a week.
<i>(static/haunting music)</i>
- <i>(Helo)</i> Lieutenant?
- Oh, morning, XO.
Morning. It's just temporary.
The colonel will pull it together.
Right.
We're using the tylium ship as a decoy
to lead the Cylons along this course,
almost directly opposite to ours.
When they reach this point here
they'll recalibrate their FTL
and jump back to rendezvous with the rest
of the fleet here at the Ionian Nebula.
Any indication the Cylons are following?
Nothing yet. It would appear
they've stopped following us as well.
Our Raptors have yet to pick up any sign
of pursuit since the ship left the fleet.
How many jumps
until we reach the nebula?
Uh...
it's hard to believe,
but we're down to the last three.
Good.
Is there anything else, sir?
No. No, l was just, uh...
just remembering back on Caprica,
when the weather was about to change,
you'd... you'd get this smell in the air.
The sun could be out, not a cloud
in the sky, but you'd pick up this smell,
and you knew that, um...
something was just over the horizon.
Weather's changing, Felix.
We need to be ready for it.
There's a storm coming.
<i>(haunting music)</i>
It's in the ship.
It's in the frakking ship!
- <i>(talks gibberish)</i>
- He's doing it again.
- Thanks.
- <i>(laughs)</i>
<i>Previously on "Battlestar Galactica":</i>
- <i>(Adama)</i> This is it.
- That's it, the Ionian Nebula.
So what do you think we'll find?
A beacon? A temple? A signpost to Earth?
How many more jumps
before we find the nebula?
l'm estimating an even dozen.
We're getting close.
Still no sign of the Cylons.
<i>(Skulls)</i> l didn't hear you say that...
<i>(radio static)</i>
- Go back. You almost had it.
- <i>(Seelix)</i> Had what?
That song.
You don't hear that song?
It's in the frakkin' ship!
- This is my son.
- l am very sorry, but l am not responsible.
No. He's sick
and l want you to bless him.
Bless him?
You are saying that the defendant,
Gaius Baltar,
ordered your execution
and the execution of 200 other people?
That's exactly what l'm saying.
This is a death warrant. Have you seen
the names on this list? Do you have...
Gaius Baltar chose
to side with the Cylons
and to actively seek the deaths
of his fellow citizens.
Madam President, are you taking
chamalla at this time?
Don't answer.
l'm putting a stop to this now.
If she is on drugs,
it goes to her credibility as a witness.
l am taking chamalla again
because my cancer has returned.
l'm calling you a liar and a coward.
And for what?
The traitorous piece of garbage
Gaius Baltar
who doesn't even deserve a trial.
l will not serve under a man
who questions my integrity.
And l won't have an officer under
my command who doesn't have any.
Argh!
Frak me.
<i>(telephone buzzes)</i>
Yes?
<i>(Roslin)</i> Yell at me.
l don't wanna get out of bed.
<i>You've called the wrong number.</i>
<i>l was thinking of going back to bed.</i>
- You feeling OK?
- Says the cancer patient.
Yeah, l'm fine. l just cut myself.
How are you doing?
l don't wanna face them.
l don't wanna face any of them. l just
wanna stay in bed all day and sleep.
Uh, l think l stopped the bleeding.
<i>If you still need to be yelled at,</i>
<i>l think l can give you some volume.</i>
OK. All right,
give it your best shot.
- Get out of that bed!
- That's not your best shot.
Get your fat, lazy ass
out of that rack, Roslin!
Yes, sir. OK, sir.
Anything you say, sir.
Thank you.
Don't let them
see you sweat, Laura.
<i>(man hums "All Along The Watchtower")</i>

- Come here.
- l can't.
- Come here.
- l've gotta go back to the <i>Colonial One.</i>
You don't have to go anywhere.
<i>(static/haunting music)</i>
<i>(static)</i>
What is that music? Gods!
- What did you just say?
- <i>(knock on door)</i>
Frak.
<i>(knock on door)</i>
Yeah, l'm coming.
- Hey. Why is the door locked?
- Sorry.
<i>(distant music)</i>
<i>(music grows louder)</i>
We should go for a mistrial.
What? What's he talking about?
What are you talking about?
- Mistrial? Whatever for?
- Because we're losing.
Not from where l'm standing.
We're actually doing quite well.
We're about to break the prosecution.
We've blown two key witnesses out of
the water. What more do we need to do?
Everyone in that courtroom hates you.
<i>Everyone.</i> Including the judges.
My father called you a traitorous piece of
garbage who doesn't even deserve a trial.
- He said that? He actually said that?
- Yes, he did.
And l don't think
he's the only one up there.
l agree. Our tactical victories
are pissing them off.
Right. So now, because we're winning,
we're losing, actually?
Perverse, isn't it?
One of the reasons why l love what l do.
"Forcing a mistrial may seem
of little benefit to either side,
but it can be a boon to the defence.
The prosecution has shown their hand."
"At retrial, the defence has
the tactical advantages
and the statistical chances
of an acquittal rise by 25°/Ş."
- Joseph Adama.
- <i>Trial Tactics and Strategies,</i> page 273.
Smart man, your grandfather.
- l can see why you'd want a mistrial.
- Sorry? What's that supposed to mean?
That would be the quickest way
for you to absolve all your responsibility.
You get back to your life, you get
back to... wherever you get back to,
and l get back to a cell and l have
to go through this all over again.
l can't physically take that.
No more games.
No mistrials.
There will be a verdict.
<i>Yesterday marked a surprising turn</i>
<i>of events in the trial of Dr Gaius Baltar,</i>
<i>when Colonel Tigh admitted...</i>
Before any of you can think about flying
my Raptors, you have to know systems.
Electronics, avionics, navigation...
- <i>(static)</i>
- ...engine control, DRADIS configuration...
- <i>(Chief hums "All Along The Watchtower")</i>
- ...autopilot, and propulsion systems.
<i>(static)</i>
The best way to learn that is on a Raptor.
That means getting your hands dirty.
Come on.
- <i>(Chief humming)</i>
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Chief?
- Hey, Sam.
<i>(hums "All Along The Watchtower")</i>
That song you're humming.
What is that?
Oh. Uh...
You know, l don't even know. It's just
something l can't get out of my head.
There must be some way out of here...
l've been hearing that...
everywhere.
On a boom box.
You know, in the bar?
Come here.
- You hear <i>that</i> song?
- Yeah. And it's freaking me out.
l hear it everywhere, but l can't
really hear it. You know what l mean?
Yeah. You can grab part of the melody
and then it goes away?
- Like it's something from child...
- Childhood.
- Exactly.
- Yo, Anders!
Do you need a frakking invitation?
- Move it!
- All right.
No reason to get excited.
<i>(Cottle)</i> Well, congratulations.
You survived your first Doloxan treatment.
Oh! Talk about the cure
being worse than the disease.
Next time bring some paperwork
to help keep your mind off it.
- It'll also help keep blood pressure down.
- Yeah, right.
- If you'll excuse me, l have other patients.
- All right, go.
Oh, gods!
Argh.
<i>(Roslin)</i> Hera!
<i>(both scream)</i>
<i>(rapid beeping)</i>
<i>(Cottle)</i> What's going on?
You're both freaking out
at the same time?
We need a moment.
Take this off. Get this off me, please.
Will somebody please tell me
what the hell is going on?
You can go outside. Thank you.
We'll be fine. Shut the door.
<i>(guard)</i> Yes, ma'am.
<i>(door closes)</i>
l'm sorry about the shackles.
Were you with us a moment ago
in the lobby of the opera house?
l'll take that as a yes
by the look on your face.
l was there too.
And so was Hera.
That shouldn't be possible.
Add it to the list.
Were you trying to reach Hera?
l don't know.
l just knew that l had to
protect her with my life.
l'm telling you, Bill, they put the music
in the ship. l can hear it.
- l believe you. l'll look into it.
- You'll look into it?
You'll look into it? l am here telling you
there is Cylon sabotage aboard our ship!
Sabotage? With music?
l know, l know.
l can't quite understand it myself, but...
There's too much confusion.
l promise l'll look into it.
Now l have to get to court.
OK.
OK.
Go to court.
<i>(door opens)</i>
There must be
some kind of way out of here.
Do you recognise
this document, Lieutenant?
Yes, l do. It's a death list issued on
New Caprica by the office of the president.
- Who signed this document?
- President Gaius Baltar.
Hm.
- Could it be a forgery?
- No.
And how do you know
that it cannot be a forgery?
- Because l was there. l saw him sign it.
- What are you saying?! You weren't there!
- That's a lie! That's a total fabrication!
- <i>(Franks)</i> Order!
l saw him sign it.
Describe the scene, would you?
The Cylons brought the document
into the presidential office.
They'd already selected the names.
One of them,
l believe it was a Three,
gave the list to the president and said:
"Here are the people that are going
to be executed. Please sign this."
He looked at the list, he saw
all the names... and then he signed it.
Did he protest? l mean, did he argue?
Did he offer any resistance whatsoever?
- <i>(man)</i> Sign it!
- <i>(Baltar)</i> l won't do it.
You're going to have to solve
your consciences some other way.
Sign it! Sign your name!
Sign it!
No. He never did.
Oh, Felix. Oh, Felix.
What are you doing?
Get that out of my face.
- We'll get him in the cross.
- Control your client.
It's no secret. The whole fleet knows this
man tried to stab me through the neck.
And you missed!
Butter fingers!
- Sorry, Your Honours.
- No further questions.
Your witness, Counsellor.
- No questions.
- <i>(Baltar)</i> What?!
<i>(muttering/gavel bangs)</i>
- What are you?
- Witness is dismissed.
<i>(Baltar)</i> Oh! Oh, great.
- What the hell are you doing?
- It's your word against his.
If he's decided to perjure himself,
there's nothing we can do.
We're going to have to
adjust our strategy.
Is the defence prepared
to present their case?
Your Honours, at this time,
if it please the court...
uh...
l would like to offer a motion.
The defence would like to move
for a mistrial.
No, we do not want a mistrial!
l do not want a mistrial!
<i>(Franks)</i> Gaius Baltar!
Behave, Dr Baltar.
On what grounds, Counsellor?
On the grounds that one of the panel has
already prejudged the outcome of this trial
and determined the guilt
of the defendant.
That's a very serious charge,
Mr Lampkin.
Which judge?
- That would be you, Admiral.
- <i>(muttering)</i>
And to prove it, l need to take the unusual
step of calling Mr Lee Adama to the stand.
<i>(muttering)</i>
- You've gotta be frakking kidding me!
- This is the only way we're gonna win.
- l will not testify against my father.
- That is your choice.
Either way,
l'm putting you on the stand.
Your Honours, this is completely
improper. Counsel cannot testify at trial.
l can cite at least seven precedents
off the top of my head.
- Call your witness, Counsellor.
- Thank you.
Mr Adama.
Mr Adama, did you meet with your father,
Admiral Adama, four days ago?
Yes.
At that meeting,
did Admiral Adama express an opinion
as to whether the defendant
deserved a trial?
All l'm looking for is the truth here,
Mr Adama. Let's have it.
l'm waiting.
Answer the question.
You swore an oath
as an officer of the court.
If you don't answer the question,
you hold the entire system of justice...
- What frakking system?!
- Mr Adama.
l'm sorry, Your Honours.
Please excuse my associate.
All right, all right.
l'll try something else.
Do you believe that the defendant
deserves a fair trial?
- As a matter of fact, l do.
- Why?
Aside from the fact
everyone deserves a fair trial,
l also happen to believe
that he is not guilty...
Your Honours,
l must insist on an exception here.
- He can't testify in this way. It is improper.
- l agree.
He can make his argument
in closing statements.
l'm inclined to agree
with the prosecution.
Thank you.
You can appeal to the president
if you feel that this influences the verdict,
but I, for one,
would like to hear
this witness testify.
<i>(male judge)</i> l would second that.
- Continue.
- Thank you, Your Honours.
Mr Adama?
- Mr Adama?
- Yes?
Why do you believe that the defendant,
Gaius Baltar,
deserves to be acquitted?
Well, because the evidence
does not support the charges.
Come on.
Did the defendant make mistakes?
Sure, he did.
Serious mistakes.
But did he actually commit any crimes?
Did he commit treason? No.
It was an impossible situation. When
the Cylons arrived, what could he do?
What could anyone have done?
Ask yourself,
what would you have done?
What would you have done?
If he had refused to surrender, the Cylons
would've nuked the planet then and there.
So did he appear to cooperate
with the Cylons? Sure.
So did hundreds of others. What's
the difference between him and them?
The president issued a blanket pardon.
They were all forgiven,
no questions asked.
Colonel Tigh...
Colonel Tigh used suicide bombers,
killed dozens of people. Forgiven.
Lieutenant Agathon and Chief Tyrol,
they murdered an officer on the <i>Pegasus.</i>
Forgiven.
The admiral. The admiral instituted a
military coup d'état against the president.
Forgiven.
And me?
Well... where do l begin?
l shot down a civilian passenger ship -
the <i>Olympic Carrier.</i>
Over a thousand people on board.
Forgiven.
l raised my weapon to a superior officer,
committed an act of mutiny. Forgiven.
Then, on the very day
Baltar surrendered to those Cylons,
I, as commander of <i>Pegasus,</i>
jumped away.
l left everybody on that planet alone,
undefended, for months!
l even tried to persuade the admiral
never to return,
to abandon you all there for good.
If l'd had my way,
nobody would've made it off that planet.
l'm the coward.
l'm the traitor.
l'm forgiven.
l'd say we're very forgiving of mistakes.
We make our own laws now, our own
justice, and we've been pretty creative
at finding ways to let people off the hook
for everything - theft, murder.
And we've had to be. Because... because
we are not a civilisation any more.
We are a gang. And we're on the run.
And we have to fight to survive.
We have to break rules, we have to
bend laws, we have to improvise.
But not this time, no.
Not this time.
Not for Gaius Baltar.
No. You... you have to die.
You have to die because... Well,
because we don't like you very much.
Because you're arrogant.
Because you're weak.
Because you're a coward.
We wanna throw you out the airlock
because you didn't stand up to the Cylons
and get yourself killed in the process.
That's justice now!
You should've been killed
on New Caprica.
But since you had the temerity to live,
we'll execute you now. That's justice!
<i>(muttering)</i>
<i>(gavel bangs)</i>
Order. Order!
This case...
this case is built on emotion,
on anger, bitterness, vengeance.
But most of all
it is built on shame.
It's about the shame of what we did
to ourselves back on that planet.
And it's about the guilt
of those of us who ran away.
Who ran away.
And we are trying to dump all that guilt
and all that shame onto one man.
And then flush him out the airlock
and hope that that just gets rid of it all,
so that we can live with ourselves.
That won't work.
That won't work.
That's not justice.
Not to me.
Not to me.
No further questions.
Your Honours, l wish to reiterate my
strong exception to counsel's testimony.
- <i>(Franks)</i> Exception noted.
- Thank you.
Did you want to cross-examine
the witness?
l have no questions
for defence counsel.
<i>(Franks)</i> Witness is excused.
Do you want to call
any other witnesses?
Your Honours,
l don't wish to belabour this any longer.
The defence rests.
Very well. This court will adjourn
to consider a verdict.
What a glorious moment
in jurisprudence.
You did a great job.
<i>(man)</i> All rise.
Before l read the verdict,
l'd like to make one thing clear.
Like everything human,
justice is imperfect.
It's flawed.
But it's those very imperfections
that separates us from the machines,
and maybe even makes us
a species worth saving.
The defendant will rise.
Gaius Baltar,
after carefully weighing the evidence,
this tribunal,
on a vote of three to two...
finds you not guilty.
<i>(uproar)</i>
You won.
Let's go.
l knew l would be acquitted,
but the fact that l was found innocent
shouldn't disguise in any way
that this trial has been a total pantomime.
Admiral, you've gotta
get him out of here.
Down! Bring him down!
Stand back! Get him out of here!
Get him away!
l knew right from the very start
that if there was a way to demonstrate
the sheer...
What's the word l'm looking for?
Hypocrisy.
"Hypocrisy" is the word l'm looking for.
...hypocrisy of the prosecution's case,
then the judges had no other option
but to find me not guilty.
Your boundless confidence
provided us with great solace throughout.
Look, l wanna thank you both.
Truly.
From the bottom of my heart, l am very,
very grateful for all you've done.
If l could've seen the admiral squirm
a little bit more, it wouldn't have hurt.
Now, you listen.
Don't push it, Doctor.
Fine.
Romo, um...
perhaps we could have a chat.
l've thought about a book tour around
the fleet, and there's the publishing rights.
There are issues about my security -
where l'm gonna live.
Since we forged this great relationship
during the trial, l thought who better to...
Actually, now that the fleet's
legal system is in place,
my not-so-inconsiderable talents
are required elsewhere.
So l'm afraid
this is the end of our journey.
What?
Wait a minute, what?
What about me?
Wait a minute. Wait, please.
Think about this for a second.
Where am l going to live? What am l
going to do? How am l going to survive?
Much as l hate to use
a cat metaphor, Doctor...
l think you'll land on your feet.
<i>(chuckles)</i>
Close the door on your way out.
Romo, one thing.
When you put me on the stand,
did you know what was gonna happen?
l knew you were an honest man,
Mr Adama, much unlike your grandfather.
Gaius Baltar is innocent.
Just the sound of it
makes my skin crawl.
Not guilty is not the same
as innocent.
It must have been
particularly difficult for you.
What? You just couldn't get
the other two guys to budge?
You voted for his acquittal,
didn't you?
l hate to say it.
Defence made their case.
Prosecution didn't.
Gaius Baltar is a traitor.
We both know that,
regardless of the outcome
of this trial.
No one's asking anyone to forget,
or to forgive.
But we have to look to the future.
- Mr Gaeta.
- Yes, sir?
Commence jump prep.
- We're going to the Ionian Nebula.
- Yes, sir.
Excuse me.
<i>(Gaeta)</i> Coordinates distributed. All ships
show green for jump formation delta.
- Initiate jump.
- Aye, sir.
Jumping in three,
two, one. Jump.
Jump complete.
- All fleet ships reporting in, sir.
- Very well, Mr Gaeta.
Commence DRADIS scan.
Let's see what's out there.
Oh!
Ooh.
<i>(Gaeta)</i> Sensors show major
power fluctuations. Checking on fleet.
<i>(man)</i> Go ahead!
<i>(static/haunting music)</i>
<i>(Racetrack)</i> Nuggets on me!
Nuggets on me!
If you have a flashlight, turn it on.
- <i>(Gaeta)</i> Check auxiliary power.
- <i>(Dualla)</i> Negative power. Batteries only.
<i>(Adama)</i> Get ready for an engine restart.
<i>(man)</i> DC6 needs to get down there
and muster.
Gaius. It's OK.
Come with me.
- Where are you taking me to?
- To your new life. Here. Come.
Let's get the power back up.
Come on, people. You know what to do.
<i>(static)</i>
<i>(voices slow down and fade)</i>
There must be
some kind of way out here.
<i>(Racetrack)</i> There's lots
of equipment around. It's all live.
Said the joker to the thief.
<i>(static)</i>
<i>(breathes heavily)</i>
There's too much confusion here.
<i>(retches)</i>
l can't get no relief.
<i>(Tory)</i> Hey.
This isn't happening.
Please tell me this isn't happening.
So that's it.
After all this time,
a switch goes off just... like that.
Whoa.
Oh, no way.
l don't believe this.
l'm not buying this. This is a...
This is a trick. Come on!
We're not...
We're not...
What is that... song? I...
<i>(hums "All Along The Watchtower")</i>
<i>(joins in humming)</i>
<i>(hums)</i>
<i>(all hum "All Along The Watchtower")</i>
All right!
That's enough, godsdammit!
Deadbolt that frakking door!
40 years in the service.
40 years.
Two wars.
Combat.
Locked in that dungeon
on New Caprica.
Ellen.
My gods!
What about Ellen?
No, no, no, no, no.
Not after all this.
Not after the Resistance...
and the occupation.
After watching my friends die
one after another for frakking this?!
- Sam.
- Stay the hell away from me.
You all just stay the frak away from me.
<i>(Chief)</i> Sam... it's true.
We're Cylons.
And we have been from the start.
- <i>(Roslin)</i> Admiral, what's going on?
- Some kind of power surge.
Give me a damage report immediately.
The power outage
was fleet-wide, Admiral.
It was also simultaneously
restored to all ships.
- Admiral, admiral.
- DRADIS contact.
Massive Cylon fleet
on intercept course.
Gaeta, sound action stations immediately.
XO, l want emergency jump, entire fleet.
Sir, all fleet ships
were powered down during the outage.
It'll take 20 minutes
to spool up FTL drives.
We just don't have 20 minutes.
Action stations.
Set condition one throughout the ship.
All Viper pilots report to Vipers
immediately. Inbound Cylon fleet.
<i>l repeat. Action stations. Set condition one</i>
<i>throughout the ship. This is not a drill.</i>
Oh, gods.
What are we gonna do?
The ship is under attack.
We do our jobs.
Report to your stations.
But where's the stations?
My name is Saul Tigh.
l am an officer in the Colonial fleet.
Whatever else l am,
whatever else it means,
that's the man l want to be.
And if l die today,
that's the man l'll be.
- Where the hell have you been?!
- l'll tell you later.
Get those steps off.
Get those steps off. Come on!
All right, people.
We are under attack! Let's go, let's go!
- <i>(Adama)</i> Arm and load nuclear weapons.
- <i>(Helo)</i> Yes, sir.
- It's good to see you, Colonel.
- Good to be here, Admiral.

NEW CAPRICA
67ÈME JOUR D'OCCUPATION
Et voilà...
Un pour la route ?
Ça tient au chaud et au sec.
Oh non, pas pour moi.
Le couvre-feu est dans 20 minutes.
Le soleil se couche toujours plus tôt.
J'ai vraiment pas envie de
passer la nuit dans une cellule cylon.
Le premier geste d'aide des cylons,
construire une prison.
Il est tellement beau.
Vous devriez en avoir un !
On y travaille !
Gros boulot si vous y arrivez !
- Merci ! Au revoir.
- Au revoir, faites attention.
On doit te trouver une copine,
Ouais, si Nora a une sœur, je suis là !
Désolée, je ne peux pas t'aider !
C'est toute l'histoire de ma vie !
Non non non, on arrête.
Si on veut avoir un bébé,
il va falloir s'acheter une conduite.
Tu as entendu pour Longo ?
Non, quoi ?
Les Toasters l'ont eu.
Ils ont trouvé sa cache d'armes.
Tu crois que Duck va mordre ?
Jammer est en train de le découvrir.
Au moins les cylons n'ont pas tout eu.
Longo avait caché ceux-là sous ses toilettes.
C'est tout ce qui reste ?
Putain, c'est pathétique.
Si ça continue comme ça, on n'aura plus
que des pierres à jeter à ces batards.
Et personne pour les jeter.
Ils l'ont tué de sang froid ?
Les Toasters ont dit qu'il cherchait
son arme quand ils ont trouvé sa planque
Quoi ?
Charlie n'est pas aussi bête.
Ces enculés l'ont assassiné.
Dieux ! Pauvre Charlie.
Cacher des armes dans
sa tente, il s'attendait à quoi ?
Maintenant ils veulent
qu'on fasse le sale boulot à leur place ?
C'est une blague ?
La police de New Caprica ?
Quel tas de conneries !
Certains disent que c'est une bonne chose.
Enlever les Centurions des rues
et patrouiller par nous même.
Charlie serait peut-être
encore vivant si des humains...
Peu importe comment tu tournes ça,
travailler pour les toasters,
c'est de la trahison, c'est tout.
On y va.
Merde, j'ai oublié mon chapeau chez le Chef.
- On se voit plus tard.
- D'accord.
- À plus, mec.
- Ouais.
Qu'est-ce que tu penses
de lui comme parrain ?
- Oui.
- Oui ?
C'est l'heure du dodo...
Adama n'a pas l'ombre
d'une chance de nous sortir d'ici si on
ne réunit pas une force de combat suffisante.
On va devoir les garder ici
jusqu'à trouver une meilleure cache.
- Colonel, j'ai une femme et un nouveau-né.
- On les enlèvera dès que possible.
Alors ?
Duck déteste les toasters, ça c'est sûr.
C'est aussi un ex-pilote
de Viper avec 40 victoires !
Parle-lui, fais-lui comprendre
qu'on a besoin de lui !
Sors-lui de une connerie
poétique sur le combat pour la liberté
contre l'oppresseur cylon,
fais ce qu'il faut !
On a besoin de plus de monde ou
cette résistance va mourir dans l'œuf.

Il y a des choses
qui ne se font pas, Colonel.
Même en guerre.
Laissez-moi sortir !
Tu as entendu ça ?

Écoute,
moi aussi j'aimerais botter
des culs en acier chromé avec vous.
Mais ça n'arrivera pas. J'ai juste...
d'autres projets.
D'autres projets. C'est quoi ces conneries ?
Nora.
Et alors ! J'ai une femme et un enfant,
tu crois que je ne me soucie pas d'eux ?
Quel futur allons-nous leur laisser si on
laisse tomber ? C'est une excuse de lâche.
Duck n'est pas un lâche, Chef.
Il a fait son choix, on a fait le nôtre.
On en reste là.
C'est des conneries.
Nous vous remercions
pour cette nourriture offerte.
Que cette moisson soit épargnée des fléaux.
Ainsi soit-il.
Nous avons récupéré
les armes des autres caches.
Elles sont dans des caisses
marquées "pièces de machines"
On les fera passer ici petit à petit.
Attendez un peu...
Vous voulez cacher des armes dans le temple ?
Ça te pose un problème ?
C'est une terre sacrée.
Les cylons respectent ça,
donc on ne devrait pas utiliser le temple.
- Et ça en fait la cache parfaite.
- Mais c'est un sacrilège !
Je vais te dire quoi faire.
Tu vas dire une prière.
Demande aux Dieux de nous pardonner.
On les ramène ici cette nuit.

Dans un combat pour protéger notre futur,
nous devons affronter notre passé.
Les mensonges que nous avons dits,
les décisions prises,
les personnes que nous avons aimées.
Tant que la lutte pour la survie continue
Nous ne pouvons pas affronter nos ennemis

Si vous le voulez, grande Aphrodite,
donnez-nous un enfant.
Si elle le voulait,
tu serais déjà enceinte.
Peut-être que si
tu venais au temple avec moi parfois.
Les Dieux aident
ceux qui s'aident eux-mêmes.
D'accord.
Pourquoi tu bouges pas ton cul
pour venir m'aider alors !
Jammer et Tyrol ont
essayé de me recruter aujourd'hui.
Pour la résistance ?
J'ai refusé.
Dieux merci.
Fût un temps où
je n'aurais pas hésité une seconde mais...
il faut croire que les temps changent.
Pourquoi ?
Toi !
C'est bon.
Okay, allez, allez, allez.
Que les Dieux nous pardonnent.
Allez. Jammer, on y va.
Réveil ! Tout le monde debout !
Je croyais avoir laissé toutes
ces conneries militaires sur le Galactica.
Tu es déjà en retard,
Tyrol va te botter le cul. Tiens.
Tu vas peut-être me rejoindre
au temple quand tu seras levé ?
Je ne vais pas au temple.
Ça compterait beaucoup pour moi.
Jai pas besoin de tous ces accessoires.
Je parle aux Dieux à ma manière.
Mais je serai là par la pensée.
Je te verrai ce soir.
- Okay.

Ils ont réduit le temple en lambeaux.
- J'aurais jamais révé être aussi chanceux...
- Aussi chanceux ?
Les cylons sont de pire en pire !
Ils font des arrestations au hasard !
1 000 personnes ont protesté

Ce que je sais du temple
c'est que vous avez massacré 10 innocents.
Oui.
Vous n'allez pas le croire
mais on se sent tous mal à ce sujet.
C'est tragique.
Il n'y a pas d'autre mot pour ça.
Les Centurions ont agi de manière exagérée.
Mais je crois que
si vous êtes honnête avec vous-même,
vous admettrez que
ce n'est pas que de notre faute.
C'est des conneries.
Nous avons toujours
laissé le temple tranquille.
Nous n'avions jamais pensé
à y envoyer des Centurions jusqu'à
ce que quelqu'un
décide d'y cacher des armes.
Ce n'est pas nous
qui avons tué ces gens, c'est vous.
Vrai.
Et j'en accepte l'entière responsabilité.
Mais amener des instruments de mort
dans une maison de prières, c'est un péché.
Vous n'êtes pas d'accord ?
Réfléchissez-y, James.
Ceux qui ont caché ces armes
devaient savoir que nous l'apprendrions.
Peut-être même
que l'information vient d'eux.
Ils ont voulu que ça arrive.
- Pourquoi ?
- Parce que certains ont peur de la paix.
Peur de ne plus se battre.
Peur de ce qu'ils seraient sans ça.
Mais vous n'êtes pas comme ça,
n'est-ce pas, James ?
Vous aimeriez laisser
tous ces morts derrière vous.
Avoir un jour
un endroit à vous, une ferme peut-être.
Une femme, des enfants,
une vie.
- Comme tout le monde.
- C'est possible, ça peut arriver.
Ça peut arriver
pour vous, pour moi, pour tout le monde.
Comment ?
Les gens comme vous et moi devons être
courageux pour montrer un meilleur chemin.
D'autres le font déjà.
Ce jus
provient de fermes sur New Caprica où
cylons et humains travaillent ensembles.
Ils cultivent plutôt que de s'entretuer.
Le réseau énergétique est presque
prêt ainsi que l'alimentation en eau.
Grâce à vos équipes techniques et aux nôtres.
Et quand nous aurons enfin des êtres humains
faisant la police dans les rues
au lieu des Centurions nous...
Alors tout ça pour ça ?
Vous voulez que
je rejoigne la police de New Caprica ?
Ça n'arrivera jamais,
je ne suis pas un sale collabo.
Je ne vous demande pas de l'être.
Tout ce que je vous demande c'est
de m'aider à empêcher une autre tragédie.
Et comment je peux faire ça ?
Montrez-ça à la porte
et vous pourrez voir comment faire.
Si vous entendez quoi que ce soit
pouvant mener à un carnage,
contactez-moi.
Peut-être qu'à nous deux nous pourrons
empêcher la mort d'autres innocents.

Le premier enfant hybride Cylon-Humain.
C'est vraiment un miracle de Dieu.

et je ne peux pas risquer que
des cylons mettent la main dessus,
J'ai pris ma décision.
On l'a perdue. On a fait de notre mieux
mais elle est morte

Tout ce que les Cylons savent,
c'est que cet enfant est mort.
C'est une très très bonne chose.

de la nouvelle génération de Dieu.

- C'est ça.
Je peux à peine regarder Dee en face.
On doit faire quelque chose.
OK, mais quoi ?
Je sais pas. Divorcer.
Non.
Allez, sois réaliste.
Tu dis toi même
que les choses vont mal,
que ton mariage bat de l'aile.
Ouais, mais le mariage est sacré.
C'est pas une partie de pyramide.
Tu ne peux...
T'as pas de deuxième essai, Lee.
J'ai prêté serment devant les
Dieux et je ne vais pas le rompre.
Tu le romps à chaque fois qu'on fait ça.
À chaque fois.
Le divorce, c'est différent.
Là, c'est juste une petite entorse.
Non désolé, je ne peux...
Je ne peux pas vivre ainsi.
Chaque fois que je regarde ma femme,
ma culpabilité se reflète dans ses yeux.
Lee, t'es un vrai poète
mais faut pas en faire tout un problème.
C'est un problème, Kara.
Un vrai problème.
OK.
Je veux pas divorcer
et tu veux pas la tromper.
Alors, ça nous mène où ?
Nulle part.
Qui sont les cinq autres ?

Selon une première datation au carbone,
le temple aurait au moins 4 000 ans.
ce qui coïncide
avec l'exode de la 13ème tribu.
Vous pensez avoir trouvé
le Temple des Cinq ?
Ouais.
Je l'ai reconnu d'après les livres
de mon père, Madame la Présidente.
C'était un prêtre et le Temple des Cinq
était important dans notre foi.
Dans sa foi, en tout cas.
Cet endroit aurait-il un rapport
avec l'OEil de Jupiter, Chef ?
Vous m'en demandez trop, Madame.
Tout ce dont je me souviens
provient de mes expéditions
dans le bureau de mon père
quand il regardait ailleurs.
L'OEil de Jupiter ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est exactement ?
Si l'on en croit les Écritures,
c'est une balise
laissée par la 13ème tribu.
Elle est censée indiquer la Terre.
On a une alerte, Chef.
Ici Adama.
Amiral, Lt. Gaeta au CIC.
Nous avons plusieurs contacts dradis.
- 4 vaisseaux mères en vue.
- J'arrive.
- Situation ?
- 4 vaisseaux mères en approche rapide.
Quatre ?
Ces enfoirés
nous ont littéralement sautés dessus.
La flotte prépare ses FTL, Monsieur.
Prête à sauter aux coordonnées
d'urgence à votre signal.
- Allez-y.
- À vos ordres.
On doit tenir la position jusqu'à ce
que tout le monde soit à bord.
- On en a combien en bas ?
- Suffisamment.
Si l'OEil de Jupiter est dans ce temple
et qu'il indique la Terre...
on ne peut pas laisser
les Cylons le prendre.
Parez à lancer les Vipers.
Il y a un truc bizarre.
Les Cylons ne lancent pas de Raiders.
Les vaisseaux mères
attendent hors de portée.
Ça, c'est bizarre.
Amiral...
un vaisseau-mère demande à vous parler.
Mettez-les sur haut-parleurs
Ici l'Amiral Adama.
Amiral,
je ne saurais vous dire combien
je suis heureux d'entendre votre voix.
Ici Gaius Baltar.
Je n'arrive pas à croire qu'on tolère
des Cylons sur ce vaisseau.
Ils ont une idée derrière la tête,
sinon, ils nous auraient
tiré dessus dès leur arrivée.
Pourquoi envoyer Baltar ?
Ils doivent bien se douter
qu'on ne le croira pas.
Il peut bien dire ce qu'il veut.
Plus il parle,
plus on gagne de temps
pour récupérer Lee et ses hommes.
Comme au bon vieux temps, n'est-ce pas ?
Je ne pensais pas
que cet endroit me manquerait autant.
Tu sais que tu ne peux pas revenir.
Ils t'éjecteraient aussitôt dans
l'espace puis fêteraient l'événement.
Oui, je sais.
Pourtant, je ne peux pas m'empêcher
de me sentir...
... chez moi.
Si tu es vraiment un Cylon,
l'un des cinq,
ce sentiment
fait partie de ta programmation,
- de ta couverture.
- Et si je suis finalement un humain...
Si je ne suis pas l'un des cinq,
alors c'est ma dernière chance
de voir mes semblables.
Colonel, attendez.
Voyez-vous ça. Doit-on saluer ?
C'est Boomer.
Celle qui a tiré sur le patron ?
Vous venez
de perdre votre droit de visite.
Gardez cette chose ici
jusqu'à notre retour.
Oui, Monsieur.
Les trois autres, vous continuez.
Laura...
Laura, je...
Je suis content de vous voir.
Les armes sont presque inutiles.
Oui, exactement.
Nous venons en paix.
Que voulez-vous ?
Nous voulons l'OEil de Jupiter.
Alors évitons les dénégations
et les protestations
et venons-en à ce que nous savons :
vous avez des hommes à terre.
Et vous avez découvert
les installations de la 13ème tribu.
Il n'est donc pas difficile de deviner
que la seule raison valable
pour que vous n'ayez pas déguerpi
c'est que vous avez probablement trouvé
l'artéfact, mais vous êtes incapables
de le récupérer pour le moment.
C'est juste, Madame la Présidente ?
Nous avons des hommes à la surface.
Nous ne les laisserons pas tomber.
C'est touchant,
mais pas très convaincant.
Les chances pour que nous ayons
convergé vers cette petite planète
au même moment sont infinitésimales.
Ce n'est donc pas
une question de chance.
Vous voulez l'OEil.
Les Cylons veulent l'OEil.
J'aimerais aborder les questions
concrètes qui nous sont posées,
et il y en a.
Afin que nous trouvions un compromis.
Moins cet homme parlera,
mieux ça se passera.
Attendez un peu.
Sans mon intervention,
les Cylons vous auraient atomisés
- deux secondes après leur arrivée.
- Vous devriez pouvoir gérer ça seul...
s'il ne vous fait pas vomir.
J'ai sauvé votre vie...
une nouvelle fois.
Ça fait combien de fois déjà ?
Je perds le compte.
Sans moi, vous seriez tous morts !
Qu'est-ce que vous proposez ?
Vous nous donnez l'OEil de Jupiter...
on vous laisse partir.
Et...
on vous lâche Baltar.
- Qu'est-ce que vous racontez ?
- En effet.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il a dit ?
- J'improvise.
Je fais monter les enchères.
En outre, je soupçonne que
l'Amiral et Madame la Présidente
apprécieraient de partager un
moment d'intimité avec leur ancien chef.
N'ai-je pas raison ?
Ça mérite réflexion.
Ça mérite vraiment réflexion.
Malgré cet uniforme,
ce n'est plus chez toi.
J'ai fait un choix
et je sais où va ma loyauté.
Et si je te disais
que ta fille est en vie ?
Je dirais que tu mens.
Quelqu'un ment, en effet.
Mais ce n'est pas moi.
Héra est en vie.
Pour le moment.
Elle est malade
et nous ne savons pas pourquoi.
C'est ça...
Baltar l'a trouvée
pendant l'évacuation de New Caprica.
Elle est sur notre vaisseau-mère.
D'après ce que nous savons, elle était
cachée dans l'école de Laura Roslin,
ce qui veut dire qu'elle avait
sans doute planifié ça depuis le début.
J'en ai assez entendu.
Surveillez-la.
Ils t'ont laissé croire
qu'elle était morte.
On ne fait pas ça à une personne,
on fait ça à une chose.
C'est ce que tu es
pour tes amis, Sharon.
Tu n'es pas des leurs.
Tu es une chose !
Nous ne vous livrerons pas
la clé pour trouver la Terre.
Essayez de la ramener de cette planète,
et vous verrez.
Nous sommes à quatre contre un.
À mon tour de dicter les conditions.
Faites la moindre tentative
d'attaquer ce vaisseau,
ou les hommes sur cette planète,
et je lance
toutes les ogives nucléaires que j'ai.
Il ne restera rien du continent.
Vous bluffez.
Vous voulez trouver la Terre
autant que nous.
Gardes...
- escortez-les à leur vaisseau.
- Bien, Monsieur.
Ça m'aiderait si je savais
ce que je cherche.
- Ça ressemble vraiment à un oeil ?
- Je n'en sais rien, Lee.
J'ai parcouru les Écritures, elles
font référence à l'OEil qui aurait été
laissé dans une sorte de temple
mais il n'y a aucune description.
Tout ce qu'on sait, c'est qu'il est
censé montrer le chemin de la Terre.
Et tu y crois ?
Les Cylons y croient. Je ne peux pas
prendre le risque qu'ils aient raison.
Si vous voyez
qu'ils arrivent à entrer dans le temple,
vous devrez le détruire.
Compris. Quel est...
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Les Cylons brouillent la radio.
Toutes les fréquences.
OK, il faut établir
un réseau de communications.
Concevoir un plan pour défendre
le temple pendant que Tyrol l'étudie.
Le défendre avec quoi ?
Une douzaine de marines ?
Cinq soldats tout au plus ?
On va devoir faire appel aux civils.
Je peux faire une suggestion
que tu ne vas pas aimer ?
Parce qu'il m'arrive
d'aimer tes suggestions ?
Utilise Sam pour diriger les civils.
T'es pas sérieuse ?
- Lee.
- Salut, Sam.
Salut.
J'ai appris que tu étais descendue.
J'imagine qu'il faut une urgence pour
qu'on se retrouve dans la même pièce.
On peut voir ça
plus tard s'il te plaît ?
Sam, tu vas devoir diriger les civils,
les former en équipes d'assaut.
Je donnerai les ordres de
déploiement au sergent...
Ordres de déploiement ?
Équipes d'assaut ?
Attends, certains de ces types
n'ont jamais tenu un fusil.
Tu es censé être l'expert
pour transformer les civils en soldats.
Non, on faisait de la guérilla.
Tu vois ? Des raids éclairs.
Rester en mouvement,
déstabiliser l'ennemi.
Je n'ai jamais eu à défendre une
position, ça se joue pas pareil.
Tu vas devoir vite apprendre
car c'est ce qu'on va faire.
On va défendre la position jusqu'à
ce que le Chef trouve l'OEil de Jupiter.
Donc tu veux qu'on risque nos vies
pour un truc que
vous n'avez pas encore trouvé ?
Écoute Sam,
je suis même pas sûr qu'il existe.
Mais j'ai pas à t'expliquer
tous les putains de détails.
Tu sais ce que tu devrais m'expliquer ?
Le Major est responsable
sur ce coup-là, OK ?
OK ?
Je ne voudrais surtout pas
me mettre entre toi et ton Major.
À mon avis, ça s'est très bien passé.
- Il le fera.
- Il a intérêt.
Nicky me manque.
- Tu penses qu'il va bien ?
- Oui, il va bien.
- Il est sur le Galactica, il va bien.
- Je sais.
Quand j'étais gamin je détestais
tout ce qui se rapportait à la foi.
Les règles, les rituels,
les discussions sans fin
lors des dîners.
Je me faufilais
dans la salle de prière de ma mère,
le Saint des Saints. Je dansais
tout nu avec des revues pornos
juste pour défier les Dieux
et leur dire d'aller se faire foutre.
Je sais même pas
comment j'ai trouvé cet endroit.
J'ai juste eu
ce besoin pressant de marcher.
Et puis, tout à coup, c'était là.
Tu devrais voir le regard
que tu as quand tu es ici.
Il y a comme du...
respect.
Même ta voix est plus douce.
Je ressens quelque chose ici.
Quelque chose de vrai.
Et me voilà en train de poser
des bombes dans cet endroit si spécial.
Le Saint des Saints. Ceci est...
le Temple des Cinq.
Si seulement mes parents
pouvaient le voir.
Et je vais le faire exploser.
J'ai remarqué des anomalies
dans la ceinture de radiations solaires.
J'ai effectué une analyse
des modes vibratoires de l'étoile.
Assurément,
elle est extrêmement instable,
et croyez-le ou pas, elle est
sur le point de devenir une supernova.
Quand ?
Ça pourrait être demain.
Ça pourrait être l'an prochain.
Aucun moyen d'être sûr, Monsieur.
Quand ça arrivera,
le seul avertissement que nous aurons
sera une éjection d'hélium.
On devra alors sauter avant que l'onde
de choc ne détruise tout le système.
Monsieur, je ne suis pas du genre
à chercher des signes divins.
Mais je n'arrive pas à sortir de ma tête
toutes ces coïncidences.
Humains et Cylons convergeant
sur cette planète au moment exact
où cette étoile est sur le point
de devenir une supernova ?
Je ne suis pas croyant, M. Gaeta,
comme vous le savez tous deux.
Alors si ceci est
l'oeuvre d'une force supérieure,
alors elle a un sacré sens de l'humour.
Nous sommes dans l'impasse.
C'était prévisible.
Ils ont l'OEil et ils l'atomiseront
si nous essayons de le prendre.
Et nous les anéantirons
s'ils essaient de le ramener
sur le Galactica.
On est sûr qu'ils l'ont ?
Comment savoir s'ils bluffent ?
Vous ne pouvez pas.
Tous les trois, nous pensons
qu'on ne peut pas prendre ce risque.
Je pense qu'on rate l'essentiel ici.
On a l'occasion de débarrasser l'univers
de la pestilence humaine,
une fois pour toutes.
On parlera de ça
après avoir récupéré l'OEil de Jupiter.
Après avoir trouvé
le chemin de la Terre.
Laissez-moi vous rappeler
qu'il importe peu
qu'on trouve la Terre en cinq jours,
ou en cinq mille ans.
Nous sommes des machines.
On sera encore là
pour savourer le grand miracle.
Alors, laissons-les détruire l'OEil.
S'ils l'ont vraiment.
Nous devons profiter de la situation
et détruire le Galactica
une fois pour toutes.
Ou nous pouvons
rester là et ne rien faire.
Nous ne faisons pas "rien", Cavil.
- Des actions sont en cours.
- Pardon, qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
D'Anna ?
J'ai envoyé un Raider lourd à la surface
de la planète juste après le saut.
J'ai pensé que c'était notre meilleure
chance d'échapper à leur dradis.
On dirait que j'avais raison.
Y a-t-il une raison pour nous avoir
tenu à l'écart de cette décision ?
C'était une mission confidentielle.
Je vous le dis car vous devez
rentrer dans la confidence.
Nous avons coupé
les communications de leurs troupes,
et nous avons déployé nos forces au sol.
Donc, dès que les centurions
auront pris l'OEil,
vous pourrez abattre le Galactica.
Voilà le topo...
On n'a plus le choix.
Les cylons
nous ont cloués sur ce caillou,
et notre seule issue
est de tenir cette position
jusqu'à ce que le Galactica
envoie une équipe de secours.
Je vous ai
répartis en deux équipes, OK ?
L'équipe 1 va distribuer des
munitions dans tout le camp.
L'équipe 2 va fabriquer
des mines de tylium artisanales.
Je sais que c'est pas très glorieux,
mais on aura besoin de ce petit extra
au cas où les cylons
décident de nous attaquer.
Écoutez, je sais que certains ont peur.
Et c'est normal parce que...
moi aussi, j'ai peur.
mais si on garde notre sang-froid
et qu'on fait notre boulot,
on peut y arriver.
On peut s'en sortir en un seul morceau.
Berley a une liste
avec vos noms et vos affectations.
Allez la voir, on se retrouve dehors.
C'était bien.
Sincèrement.
Tu ferais un bon officier.
Un officier, hein ?
Comme toi.
Une personne
qui prête serment, et sait s'y tenir ?
Tu crois qu'il se passe quelque chose...
Ne m'insulte pas, OK ?
Je ne suis pas idiot.
Je connais ma femme,
je sais comment elle est.
On est mariés depuis un an et demi.
Tu crois être le premier ?
J'ai choisi d'épouser Kara,
c'est mes affaires...
Mais toi...
Je sais pas ce que
t'essaies de faire, putain.
J'essaie de gagner une guerre.
J'essaie de sortir ces gens de ce
caillou en un seul morceau.
Tout pour la cause, Major.
Gaius, je suis sur le point de voir
le visage des cinq derniers Cylons.
Peut-être le visage de Dieu lui-même.
Les cinq lueurs
de l'Apocalypse naissante,
luttant contre la lumière...
Des scènes révélées à ceux qui
entrent dans le temple.
Seulement à l'élu.
L'élu.
L'élu.
Les cinq m'attendent.
Gaius, je suis si proche de la vérité.
Quelle vérité ?
Caprica.
J'aime à penser que nous trois
avons partagé quelque chose.
Transcendé les barrières
entre les peuples et pourtant,
plus ça va, plus j'ai le sentiment
d'être tenue à l'écart.
Eh bien, ce n'est pas du tout le cas.
N'est-ce pas ?
Parce que tous les trois, on forme
un tout, on fait partie de...
C'est fini.
Ma destinée et celle de Baltar
se séparent de la tienne, Caprica.
Les cinq lueurs ne seront révélées
qu'à ceux qui entrent dans le temple.
Nous devons aller sur la planète.
Seuls toi et moi pouvons voir cela.
Que cherchez-vous ?
Quel secret poursuivez-vous ?
Vous devez me dire la vérité.
Je vous aime tous les deux.
Nous t'aimons aussi.
Mais c'est quelque chose que
nous ne pouvons partager avec toi.
Quelque chose
qu'on ne peut pas partager ?
Je t'aimais quand
tout le monde voulait ta mort.
Écoute, ne te méprends pas.
Ça n'a rien de personnel.
Transcendant.
Comme tu l'as dit, c'est transcendant.
Prie pour nous, Caprica.
Nous prierons pour toi.
OK, il veut qu'on établisse
des postes d'observation
communiquant
avec la base par liaison filaire.
Les troupes seront rassemblées
à des points stratégiques
pour nous avertir autant que possible
si les Cylons avancent.
Comme on n'a qu'un Raptor,
le capitaine Thrace volera par ici.
Super.
La radio est morte
donc si vous avez un contact,
n'attaquez pas. Volez jusqu'au
point d'observation le plus proche
qui relaiera l'information
au point de commandement.
Relevez bien leurs forces,
leur direction et leur position.
J'ai déjà fait quelques missions
de reco, Lieutenant.
Griggs, toi et Varrick,
installerez un poste d'observation ici.
Hanek et Deetca, vous irez là.
- Et qui prend le numéro 3 ?
- Ce sera le sergent Fisher et moi.
Ça vous pose problème, Capitaine ?
- Non.
- On part dans une heure.
Green Base, ici Foxfire 1.
Green Base, ici Foxfire 1.
 Nous sommes parés. Terminé.
Et merde.
Dis-moi que tu transmets ça.
Elle nous envoie un message.
Ça dit "centurie".
Starbuck est touchée.
Je répète :
Starbuck va s'écraser.
Il n'y a pas grand chose sur l'OEil
dans les Écritures, mais il y a
plusieurs récits intéressants
sur le temple. Écoutez ça.
"Les cinq piliers du temple
ont été ouvragés
à l'image les cinq prêtres
- fidèles de celui qu'on ne nomme..."
- Laura.
Oui ?
La Cylon que l'on appelle Boomer
est venue avec les autres.
Elle a dit à notre Sharon
que sa fille est vivante,
qu'elle est à bord
d'un des vaisseaux mères,
et qu'elle avait été vue
dans votre école sur New Caprica.
L'enfant est en vie.
Oui.
Oui.
L'enfant était à l'école.
Je l'y ai gardée.
Nous soupçonnions
que les Cylons l'avaient capturée
pendant l'exode de New Caprica.
C'est vrai.
Écoutez, vous devez savoir que...
Avez-vous idée
ce que nous avons enduré ?
Vous, plus que quiconque...
vous savez ce que c'est
que de perdre un enfant.
La différence c'est que
votre enfant est toujours en vie.
Et j'espère qu'un jour,
vous en serez reconnaissants.
Je veux la voir.
Comment ça, "elle est à terre" ?
À terre où ?
Quelque part au Nord, dans la vallée.
Alignez vos hommes,
faites le plein de munitions.
- Ils viennent du Nord.
- On fait une mission de secours, non ?
Non.
On n'a pas les ressources,
on doit défendre notre position.
- Lee, elle est peut-être mourante.
- Oui, je sais ça, Sam.
Mais on n'est pas beaucoup ici
et les Cylons font mouvement.
On ne peut pas l'aider.
On doit tenir nos positions.
Putain, t'as perdu la tête ?
On vient de repérer six Raiders lourds
quittant la flotte cylon
et se dirigeant vers la planète.
Je ne comprends pas.
- Ils doivent savoir qu'on les voit.
- Ils nous testent.
Ils veulent savoir si on bluffe
sur la destruction de la planète.
Malheureusement, c'est le cas.
Vraiment ?
- Monsieur Hoshi.
- Oui, Monsieur ?
Faites charger les têtes nucléaires
dans les silos quatre à dix.
Bien, Monsieur.
Ceci est un ordre de frappe nucléaire.
Le Major a raison.
On n'a aucune troupe en trop
si on veut tenir cette position.
Je me fous de cette position.
On peut prendre ces collines avec les
tactiques de guérilla dont j'ai parlé.
Non, c'est pas la mission,
on a des ordres. On est plus fort...
Vous êtes quoi ?
Des putains de soldats de plomb ?
- C'est de ma femme dont on parle.
- Je sais qui c'est !
Je la connais et je tiens à elle
depuis bien plus longtemps que toi.
Faites ce que vous voulez !
Je vais chercher ma femme !
Missiles chargés, Amiral.
Ouvrez les tubes.
Tubes ouverts, Amiral.
Que faites-vous ?
Je me prépare à atomiser la planète.
Radiations détectées.
- Ils ont ouverts les silos à missiles.
- Il bluffe.
- Je peux pas te laisser faire ça, Sam.
- Je te demande pas l'autorisation.
Sergent Mathias.
Chargez la balise de guidage 3 Bravo.
Point d'impact
sur la structure souterraine.
Êtes-vous prêt à sacrifier Lee ?
Ils chargent une balise de guidage.
Du bluff, ne vous laissez pas ébranler.
Le risque est inacceptable.
Rappelez les Raiders.
Les vaisseaux ne peuvent revenir.
Il ne le lancera pas.
D'Anna a été claire : elle et Baltar
doivent atterrir sur cette planète.
Voici donc la raison de tout ceci ?
"Et les cieux s'ouvrirent,
et ils virent l'OEil."
Mais où est ce putain d'OEil ?
Tu te fous de moi ?
Vous allez m'abattre maintenant ?
Je ne peux pas te laisser partir.
Tu dois être sur le front
pour commander les civils.
Désolé, Sam, mais tu ne peux pas partir.
Désolé aussi, Major,
mais tu ne pourras pas m'arrêter.
Le largage des têtes nucléaires
est maintenant autorisé.
Monsieur.

LES CYLONS FURENT CR……S PAR L'HOMME
ILS SE R…VOLT»RENT
ILS …VOLU»RENT
IL Y A DE NOMBREUSES COPIES
ET ILS ONT UN PLAN
Prťcťdemment dans
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA
Il y a assez d'algues sur cette planŤte
pour nourrir toute la flotte
mais l'ťtoile du systŤme
est extrÍmement instable,
et croyez-le ou pas
sur le point de devenir une supernova.
On vient de dťtecter
4 vaisseaux-mŤres en approche rapide.
C'est une question
de temps avant que les Cylons
dťcouvrent ce qu'on fabrique
sur cette planŤte.
Starbuck va s'ťcraser.
Je vais chercher ma femme !
- Je peux pas te laisser faire Áa, Sam.
- Je te demande pas l'autorisation.
Sergent Mathias.
Et si je te disais
que ta fille est en vie ?
- Je dirais que tu mens.
- Elle est sur notre vaisseau-mŤre.
Elle est malade.
On ne sait pas pourquoi.
Je sais pas comment
j'ai trouvť cet endroit.
J'ai juste eu ce besoin pressant
de marcher et puis, tout ŗ coup,
c'ťtait lŗ.
Les …critures disent que ce temple est
la derniŤre demeure de l'Ćil de Jupiter.
Qu'est-ce que c'est exactement ?
C'est une balise
laissťe par la 13Ťme tribu.
Elle est censťe indiquer la Terre.
Nous voulons l'Ćil de Jupiter.
ņ la moindre attaque contre ce vaisseau,
ou nos hommes sur la planŤte,
je lance toutes nos ogives nuclťaires.
Major, vous devez les retenir jusqu'ŗ ce
que le Chef trouve l'Ćil de Jupiter.
Si vous voyez qu'ils arrivent ŗ entrer
dans le temple, vous devrez le dťtruire.
Nous devons aller sur la planŤte.
Je suis si proche de voir
le visage des cinq derniers Cylons.
Les cinq ne seront rťvťlťs
qu'ŗ ceux qui entrent dans le temple.
Seulement ŗ l'ťlu... ŗ l'ťlu.
On vient de repťrer six Raiders lourds
se dirigeant vers la planŤte.
Faites charger les tÍtes nuclťaires.
Je ne vais pas laisser
les Cylons prendre l'Ćil.
 tes-vous prÍt ŗ sacrifier Lee ?
Missiles chargťs, Amiral.
Le lancement des tÍtes nuclťaires
est maintenant autorisť.
M. Gaeta...
dťsactivez les sťcuritťs de lancement
sur les tubes 4 ŗ 10.
Sťcuritťs dťsactivťes.
TÍtes nuclťaires armťes.
XO...
veuillez entrer votre code de lancement.
Ces bombes vont tout dťtruire
dans les 20 clicks autour du temple.
Je sais.
Il va le faire.
Rappelons les Raiders immťdiatement.
Nous sommes d'accord. Rappelons-les.
Nous sommes d'accord.
AprŤs tout ce temps
on ne peut se permettre de tout perdre.
Nous sommes d'accord. Rappelons-les.
PLAN»TE ALGAE
CAMP DE BASE
Si Kara meurt...
Je jure devant les Dieux
que je te tuerai.
Si elle meurt, je te laisserai faire.
On fait quoi maintenant,
tu me fais suivre avec un flingue ?
Parce que c'est la seule faÁon
de m'empÍcher d'aller retrouver Kara.
- Soldat Sykes.
- Monsieur ?
Appelez le Lieutenant Dualla.
Oui, Monsieur.
- Je t'ťcoute.
- Est-ce que tu vois Starbuck ?
Nťgatif, on n'a pas son Raptor en visuel
mais je vois la fumťe du crash.
Elle est derriŤre une colline
ŗ 2 clicks d'ici.
Tu peux rejoindre le Raptor ?
Je sais pas. C'est plutŰt loin
et largement ŗ dťcouvert.
- C'est faisable ?
- Je sais pas.
La clť de lancement.
Parť ŗ lancer.
Sťquence de lancement en mode auto.
Ils veulent la clť du chemin de
la Terre autant que nous.
Il ne la dťtruira pas.
Nous avons dťbattu
et la dťcision est prise.
Feu ŗ mon signal.
Monsieur, les Raiders font demi-tour.
- Pas tous.
- Correction. Cinq font demi-tour.
Le dernier va toujours vers la planŤte.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Il ne tirera pas pour un seul vaisseau.
- Il ne tirera pas.
- C'est pas le problŤme.
On a pris une dťcision.
D'Anna doit faire demi-tour.
Appelle D'Anna et Baltar.
- Fais-les revenir, maintenant.
- Non.
Comment Áa, "non" ?
On doit le faire.
Il ne tirera pas pour un seul vaisseau,
vous verrez.
Tu veux... tu veux que je sauve
le capitaine Thrace ?
Essaye.
Oui, Monsieur.
Foxfire 1, terminť.
On y va.
Les missiles
sont toujours parťs, Amiral.
Verrouillez les missiles.
Fermez les tubes.
Alors, vous voyez ?
Jamais pour un seul vaisseau.
Ce n'est pas bon signe, mes amis.
Elle nous a dťfiťs,
elle a dťfiť le groupe.
Il ne s'agit plus
de l'Ćil de Jupiter, mais d'elle.
C'est comme si
on ne les connaissait plus.
Nous allons devoir faire
quelque chose ŗ ce sujet.
Et le plus tŰt serait le mieux.
Hťra est en vie.
Je suis sa mŤre et je vais la rťcupťrer.
Sharon, chťrie, ťcoute-moi, OK ?
On peut prendre un Raptor,
voler jusqu'au vaisseau-mŤre.
Je m'en fous maintenant.
On ne peut pas.
On trouvera un autre moyen.
On trouvera.
Il n'y a pas d'autre moyen.
Ne me demande pas de faire Áa, Sharon.
…coute-moi.
Tu as toujours ťtť
le plus fort de nous deux.
Tu as cru en nous,
envers et contre tous.
Je te supplie de le faire.
Trouve le courage
de le faire pour nous deux, OK ?
Je t'aime.
Je t'aime aussi.

- Oui, Monsieur.
Sharon se tťlťcharge dans un autre corps
sur un vaisseau cylon, c'est Áa ?
Elle m'a suppliť.
Elle m'a suppliť de le faire.
Par les Dieux, si vous aviez...
vu son regard quand j'ai...
Elle a d'importantes
informations sur nos dťfenses.
Des codes, des procťdures,
la situation tactique ŗ la
surface de la planŤte.
Les Cylons ont accŤs
ŗ tout Áa maintenant.
Elle ne nous trahira pas.
Vous le savez. C'est pour Áa
que vous lui avez donnť l'uniforme.
Elle pourrait ne pas avoir le choix.
Vous y avez pensť ?
Elle a dit qu'elle pourrait rťsister,
qu'elle ne laisserait pas Áa arriver.
Elle va rťcupťrer Hťra...
et elle reviendra.
C'est un sacrť acte de foi
que vous avez fait lŗ, Capitaine.
Et si Áa n'impliquait que votre famille,
j'aurais trouvť Áa courageux.
Mais vous avez mis toute la flotte
en danger, vous en Ítes conscient ?
Si vous n'aviez pas menti...
et volť notre enfant
en premier lieu...
nous n'en serions pas lŗ du tout.
J'ai une part de responsabilitť
dans cette situation.
Beaucoup de reproches
peuvent Ítre faits et je l'accepte.
Et maintenant nos vies sont
entre les mains de Sharon Agathon.
Il n'y a plus qu'ŗ espťrer
que votre femme mťrite
la confiance inconditionnelle que
vous avez pour elle, Capitaine.
Ainsi que vous, Amiral.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passť ?
Ils ne voulaient pas que
je voie ma fille,
alors mon mari m'a tirť dessus.
C'ťtait le seul moyen.
C'est fini maintenant.
Ce qui compte c'est que tu sois lŗ.
Comment va ma fille ?
Son ťtat empire.
Je veux la voir.
Et puis ?
Ce qu'ils m'ont fait...
voler mon bťbť...
et me dire qu'elle ťtait morte...
Tu l'as prouvť.
Hťra est plus en sťcuritť ici...
et moi aussi.
OK, avant de se crasher,
Starbuck a repťrť au moins 15
chromťs avanÁant vers nous depuis lŗ.
Pour nous atteindre, les toasteurs
doivent passer par ce canyon.
C'est un vrai goulot d'ťtranglement.
C'est lŗ qu'on tendra l'embuscade...
faÁon guťrilla.
Notre mission est de garder le temple,
ici. Si on ťchoue, on le fait sauter.
On se replie
sur ces points de ralliement.
Ensuite on fonce dans les montagnes
et on attend les secours.
C'est un endroit qui en vaut
d'autres pour mourir, j'imagine.
- Qu'en penses-tu ?
- Et bien...
c'ťtait le jour idťal pour une marche.
Des snipers !
Reste tranquille, Fischer.
Sergent ?
Sergent...
C'est dingue,
allez... rťflťchis, rťflťchis.
Galen, c'est le major Adama.
Monsieur.
Chef, on est en position.
Vous avez pu trouver l'Ćil de Jupiter ?
Non. Major,
j'ai besoin de plus de temps.
Retournez-y.
Les Cylons avancent. On les
retiendra le plus longtemps possible.
Apollo, terminť.
OK, ťcoutez.
Remballez tout et soyez prÍts ŗ partir.
- C'est si proche.
- Je sais.
Les rťponses ŗ toutes tes questions
sont en bas dans ce Temple.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Je suis inquiŤte, Gaius.
C'est ce que nous attendions.
Tu es celle annoncťe.
Choisie par Dieu pour voir
les visages des cinq derniers cylons.
C'est ťcrit.
- Tu rťussiras.
- C'est ce qui me fait peur.
ConnaÓtre le visage de Dieu,
c'est connaÓtre la folie.
L'hybride a regardť dans l'espace
entre la vie et la mort.
Et elle a vu des choses
qu'on ne peut concevoir.
Mais Áa l'a rendue folle.
Aie foi en Dieu.
Mets ta vie entre ses mains.
Il te guidera vers ta destinťe.
Je te suis reconnaissante.
Pour tout.
Sa destinťe se sťpare
de la tienne, Gaius.
Elle n'est pas l'ťlue. Tu l'es.
Oui, je sais.
Je sais.
OK, on est prÍts.
Maintenant on attend.
Et si les Cylons ne tombent
pas dans le piŤge du Major ?
Et si on se fait ťclater
sur tous ces rochers ?
La ferme.
C'est sa bataille, pas la nŰtre.
On fait ce qu'on nous dit...
Et peut-Ítre qu'on s'en sortira.
Tu penses vraiment
que ces civils les arrÍteront ?
Ils en ont arrÍtť pleins sur Caprica
pendant qu'on luttait pour nos vies.
Trois casseroles viennent
d'entrer dans la zone de tir.
Sans doute l'ťquipe de reconnaissance.
Sykes, donne le signal.
Allez, le spectacle commence.
Bien, ils viennent vers nous.
Attends qu'ils soient
tous lŗ pour tout faire exploser.
Attends...
Venez saloperies.
Venez.
Maintenant. Maintenant !
Cessez le feu ! Ils se retirent !
Frak !
Par les Dieux !
Allez !
Merde.
Frak.
Bon, il est mort.
On doit l'isoler.
Sam, aide-moi.
On a gagnť un peu de temps,
mais ils reviendront avec du renfort.
Donc prenez position.
On doit les retenir le temps
que le Chef trouve l'Ćil.
Et surveillez ces falaises.
Des nouvelles de Kara ou de Dee ?
Non.
Starbuck ?
Dee, pourquoi tu t'es pas signalťe ?
J'ai failli te descendre.
Moi aussi, je suis contente de te voir.
Allez...
C'est bon.
Lee t'a envoyťe ?
Yep.
Mon mari...
m'a ordonnť de risquer ma vie
pour la tienne,
ce que je vais faire.
Je vais ramener Starbuck ŗ Apollo.
La voilŗ.
C'est moi.
C'est maman.
Qu'est-ce qui va pas ?
On a tout essayť. Sans rťsultat.
Regarde Áa.
Hťra la reconnaÓt.
C'est incroyable.
Vous Ítes identiques biologiquement.
Hťra reconnaÓt sa mŤre.
Tant mieux, tu peux la garder.
J'en ai assez d'elle.
Tu ne le penses pas.
Je sais que tu tiens encore
ŗ Tyrol et Adama.
Non.
Cette partie de ma vie est finie.
Je l'ai compris sur New Caprica.
Humains et Cylons
ne sont pas faits pour vivre ensemble.
On devrait poursuivre
nos propres destinťes.
Tu veux te coucher ?
Son ventre est dur comme de la pierre.
Vous l'aviez remarquť ?
Que crois-tu que Áa signifie ?
Une occlusion intestinale, peut-Ítre.
Nos docteurs l'ont examinťe.
Vos docteurs n'ont
jamais examinť un enfant.
Hťra doit voir un mťdecin humain.
Je dois la ramener sur le Galactica.
Tu sais que c'est impossible...
Et ce que cet enfant reprťsente
pour nous, pour tous les Cylons.
J'aurais dŻ m'en douter.
Elle mijotait Áa depuis le dťbut.
Examine-la !
Elle a raison.
Son ventre est dur comme de la pierre.
Si vous ne me laissez pas l'emmener
le premier
d'une nouvelle gťnťration mourra.
Dieu ne vous pardonnera jamais.
Cavil a peut-Ítre raison.
Peut-Ítre que Dieu ne veut pas
que nous ayons des enfants.
Peut-Ítre que Áa serait mieux
si je brisais ton petit cou !
Non !
Je t'en prie.
Ne tue pas ma petite fille.
Chťrie...
Je crois que l'avenir des Cylons
repose sur cet enfant.
Et sur ceux
qui viendront aprŤs elle.
Moi aussi.
On a un Raptor ŗ bord.
Allons-y. Nous devons
vous ramener sur le Galactica.
Les voilŗ. Feu !
Dites-leur de tout faire pťter !
Les Cylons se rapprochent !
C'est le Major.
- Tyrol.
- Dites-moi que vous avez trouvť l'Ćil.
Non, mais je suis pas loin.
J'ai dťchiffrť de nouveaux glyphes.
J'ai trouvť une rťfťrence ŗ un úil,
un truc sur une ťtoile
et une sorte d'explosion.
OK, allez droit au but, Chef.
Avez-vous l'Ćil de Jupiter
dans les mains ou pas ?
Non, Major.
Grenade !
Dťgoupillťe !
OK, Chef, ťcoutez-moi : c'est fini !
Conduisez tout le monde au point
de ralliement et dťtruisez le temple.
Je rťpŤte, dťtruisez le temple.
Oui, monsieur. Et merde.
OK, repliez-vous !
Sykes, Mathias, repliez-vous !
Repliez-vous !
OK, c'est fini, tout le monde. Laissez
tomber ce que vous faites et sortez.
«a vaut pour toi aussi, Cally. Allez !
Laissez le matťriel ! Allez !
Si seulement
j'avais eu un peu plus de temps.
Galen... C'est entre les mains
des Dieux maintenant. Allons-y.
On ne peut rien faire !
La structure du vaisseau est intacte.
OK.
«a veut dire que la seule chose
qui nous retient au sol
c'est les commandes de vol pťtťes,
alors...
tu vas devoir dťriver
ces faisceaux avec un c‚ble
depuis le systŤme de com et on...
on pourra essayer de se tirer d'ici.
Il n'y en a plus qu'un.
Mieux vaut le garder pour
quand tu nous feras dťcoller d'ici.
Je peux pas voler.
Surtout dťfoncťe ŗ la morphine.
Putain, Áa c'est super !
Il ne te trompera pas,
il a trop d'honneur.
Pas comme toi.
Ouais, pas comme moi.
J'aime Sam.
Je hais Sam.
J'aime Lee, je hais Lee.
Par les Dieux, j'ai besoin d'Ítre infidŤle
pour pouvoir garder l'ťquilibre.
Reste avec moi.
Tu dois encore me guider
avec cette avionique.
Les Cylons sont arrivťs au temple.
Chef, oý en Ítes-vous ?
Je branche le dernier dťtonateur.
L'Ćil de Jupiter doit se trouver
quelque part dans ce temple.
Ils l'ont connectť ŗ des explosifs.
Dťbranchons Áa.
Retirez les dťtonateurs.
Vite.
Chef, faites tout pťter !
Vous avez perdu la tÍte ?!
Je ne peux pas le faire.
Gaius !
- Oui ?
- Aide-nous !
Ouais.
Passez-moi la commande !
On y est presque.
Frak !
Qu'est-ce que vous avez fait ?
Major, regardez.
Qu'est-ce que c'est que Áa ?
Le voilŗ, Gaius.
Il a la rťponse ŗ toutes tes questions.
C'est l'Ćil ?
Quoi donc ?
Quelque chose dont a parlť l'hybride.
Saphir bleu, brillant comme une ťtoile.
D'Anna...
Tu n'es pas venue pour trouver la Terre,
tu es venue chercher autre chose.
On relŤve une impulsion massive
d'ťnergie venant de l'ťtoile centrale.
Monsieur, c'est un flash d'hťlium.
L'ťtoile se transforme en nova.
La nova va dťtruire la planŤte
dans moins d'une heure.
Major, regardez.
C'est le mandala du temple.
Cela devait arriver.
C'est Áa.
Je l'avais sous les yeux tout ce temps.
Le soleil devient une nova.
La nova est l'Ćil de Jupiter.
TrŤs bien, on peut encore le dťtruire.
Il faut seulement arriver en orbite.
Le Galactica
nous retrouvera lŗ-bas, OK ?
OK.
Bien.
Telle est ma destinťe.
De voir ce qu'il y a
entre la vie et la mort.
Et de contempler les visages
des cinq derniers.
Cela ne peut pas arriver.
Telle est ma destinťe.
Dťsolť, D'Anna.
Les cinq derniers.
C'est vraiment vous ?
Vous.
Pardonnez-moi, je ne pouvais pas savoir.
Ne pas savoir quoi ?
Qu'as-tu vu ? Que...
Qui ťtait-ce ?
C'ťtait magnifique.
Quoi ?
Dis-moi !
Suis-je l'un d'entre vous ?
Tu avais raison.
ņ propos de quoi ?
D'Anna, as-tu vu mon visage ?
Je dois savoir, s'il te plait.
S'il te plait, reste avec moi.
Reste, je dois savoir !
Dis-moi, je dois savoir !
As-tu vu mon visage ?
Suis-je un Cylon ?
Frak.
Dieu, dites-moi la vťritť
avant que je meure.
Bon retour parmi nous, M. le Prťsident.
Amiral,
la flotte cylon vient de sauter.
Ils ne veulent pas subir
l'onde de choc de la nova.
Nous non plus.
Envoyez les secours, maintenant.
On n'a pas beaucoup de temps avant
que la nova grille tout le secteur.
«a se jouera ŗ la photo-finish.
Tous les vaisseaux
de secours sont rentrťs.
Compte ŗ rebours.
Dťmarrez le FTL.
Saut ŗ trois...
deux...
un...
Je l'ai.
Il n'est pas mort ?
Non, malheureusement.
Emmenez-le en cellule.
On doit l'emmener
de suite au Dr Cottle.
OK.
En joue !
Ne tirez pas !
- Elle nous a aidťs ŗ fuir.
- Sortez de lŗ !
Lieutenant...
Sharon...
Je pense que le Chef a raison.
La nova ressemble
au mandala ŗ l'intťrieur du temple.
Vous pensez que la 13Ťme tribu
a eu une vision de l'avenir ?
Je ne vois pas d'autre signification.
Ils ont peut-Ítre vu une autre nova,
et l'ont dessinťe.
Vous avez vu une nova,
vous les avez toutes vues.
Il y a bien eu une autre nova.
Visible il y a 4 000 ans,
ŗ l'ťpoque probable
de la construction du temple.
C'est ŗ 13 000 annťes-lumiŤre
de notre position.
C'est un nuage de gaz
appelť "Nťbuleuse ionienne".
Peut-Ítre est-ce un panneau...
indiquant la direction
qu'ils ont prise ensuite.
Alors Starbuck,
c'est comme Áa que tu t'y prends
pour continuer ŗ faire la sieste ?
T'es juste venu
pour me faire chier ?
En fait,
je voudrais savoir s'il te reste
des photos
de ton ancien appartement sur Caprica.
Oui.
Le casier,
ťtagŤre du haut, la boite ŗ cigare.
- Pourquoi ?
- Une idťe qui m'est venue.
Si Sharon et toi, vous voulez redťcorer,
c'est pas dans ma piaule
que vous trouverez l'inspiration.
De ce que je me rappelle,
j'ai vu des ťpaves plus clinquantes.
Merci.
Mais je me souviens de
certains de tes tableaux.
Qu'est-ce qu'ils ont ?
Celui-ci... ťtait dans le temple.
D'oý tu as eu l'idťe
de peindre le tien ?
Je sais pas.
C'est juste un truc que je griffonne
depuis gamine, j'aimais bien la forme.
Ils ont construit
ce temple, il y a 4 000 ans.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Juste un truc qu'a dit Leoben, une fois.
Que j'avais une destinťe.
Que tout avait dťjŗ ťtť ťcrit.
Tu connais la chanson.
Inspire longuement et profondťment.
Au moins, tu n'auras
plus jamais ŗ subir Áa.
La dťcision ne fut pas facile, mais
la conclusion ťtait inťvitable.
Ton modŤle est dťfectueux ŗ la base.
Non.
Ce n'est pas un dťfaut
de se remettre en cause, si ?
De se demander qui nous a programmťs
pour penser comme cela et pourquoi ?
C'est exactement Áa le problŤme.
Ta certitude messianique
d'avoir ťtť choisie pour nous ťclairer.
Regarde les dommages que cela a causť.
- Je le referais encore.
- Oui, nous le savons.
C'est pourquoi nous avons dťcidť...
d'archiver toute ta lignťe.
Ta conscience, ta mťmoire,
les moindres pensťes de ton modŤle...
vont partir en chambre froide,
indťfiniment.
Quelqu'un doit mourir
pour connaÓtre la vťritť.
Il y a cinq autres Cylons, mon frŤre.
Je les ai vus.
Un jour, tu les verras aussi.
Un jour...
Au revoir.
Mon frŤre...
Mon frŤre...

Non désolé, je ne peux pas vivre ainsi.
Je veux pas divorcer
et tu veux pas la tromper.
- Alors, ça nous mène où ?
- Nulle part.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- L'ordre d'exécuter sommairement
tous les détenus inscrits sur la page
suivante. Il nous faut votre signature.
C'est un arrêt de mort.
Vous avez vu les noms sur cette liste ?
Vous avez une idée
de ce qu'ils vont leur faire ?
Si tu es vraiment un Cylon,
l'un des cinq, ces sentiments
font partie de ta programmation.
Les cinq ne seront révélés
qu'à ceux qui entrent dans le temple.
Seulement à l'élu... à l'élu.
Sa destinée se sépare
de la tienne, Gaius.
Elle n'est pas l'élue. Tu l'es.
Dieu, dites-moi la vérité
avant que je meure.
Suis-je un Cylon ?
Bon retour parmi nous, M. le Président.
<i>Ferme les yeux, va dormir</i>
<i>Bébé dans son berceau
compte les moutons</i>
<i>Monte dans la maison de tes rêves</i>
<i>Bébé est au berceau vite endormi</i>
<i>Dois-je mourir avant de me réveiller...</i>
Pardon.
J'improvise.
Tu fais le bon choix, Gaius.
- Gaius ?
- Quoi ?
Ouais.
Oui.
Debout !
<i>Ferme les yeux, va dormir</i>
<i>Bébé dans son berceau
compte les moutons</i>
<i>Monte dans la maison de tes rêves...</i>
Attends.
Attends un instant.
J'ai besoin de temps
pour réfléchir à tout ça.
Trop tard, Gaius.
Il est temps d'apprendre la vérité.
- Sergent.
- Désolé, Monsieur,
personne ne peut parler au détenu
sans autorisation présidentielle.
- Je suis autorisé, je dois lui parler.
- Reculez, Monsieur.
C'est bien, Gaius.
Respire profondément.
Respire profondément.
C'est bien, Gaius, respire profondément.
Respire profondément.
La première fois est la plus dure.
Tu t'en sors très bien.
Je suis vivant ?
Je suis vivant.
Dieu merci, je suis vivant !
Je t'ai toujours dit d'avoir la foi.
Alors, personne n'a été trahi.
Je n'ai jamais été l'un d'eux.
Je suis l'un des vôtres.
C'est ce que tu penses, Gaius ?
Je le savais.
J'ai toujours su que j'étais différent.
Spécial.
Peut-être un peu doué.
C'est un peu brutal.
Ça fait mal.
- Qu'est ce qui ne va pas ?
- C'est toi, Gaius.
Tu n'es pas cylon,
tu es humain et tu es mort !
Il est vivant.
Je vais chercher Cottle.

Je dis seulement que
tu vas être surpris.
- Eh bien, Major...
- Par ici.
"Chez Joe" ?
Je pense savoir ce qu'est un bar.
{\pos(192,230)} Putain, c'est du délire.
Allez.
Par ici.
Joe !
Chef Tyrol, bienvenue.
{\pos(192,230)}Les amis du major
sont mes amis, ce qui veut dire
que vous aurez le meilleur.
{\a6}Merci. Soyez indulgent si j'en abuse.
Je ne rentre pas ce soir, alors...
{\pos(192,212)}Tu t'es disputé avec Cally ?
{\pos(192,212)}Tu n'as rien entendu ?
On aurait pu vendre des billets.
Au mariage ! La raison d'être des bars.
Joe !
{\pos(192,212)}J'ai averti
des dangers du manque de sommeil.
La psychose pousse un homme
à faire des choses étranges.
{\pos(192,212)}Et la grève de la faim de Baltar
n'aide pas non plus.
{\pos(192,212)}Si cet enculé veut tellement
mourir, qu'on le laisse faire.
Au final, on veut que Baltar parle.
{\pos(192,212)}Si l'autre Cylon a vu
les mêmes symboles que nous,
{\pos(192,212)}ils peuvent être en route pour la Terre,
ou en train de tendre une embuscade.
{\pos(192,212)}Je parie qu'après ce soir,
il sera plus que motivé.
{\pos(192,212)}Doc, attendez une heure ou deux.
Je veux qu'il soit en forme.
{\pos(192,212)}Et qu'il ne soit pas affamé.
- Qu'attendez-vous de moi ?
- Que vous vous assuriez qu'il mange.
{\pos(192,212)}Je ferai mettre des
caméras de sécurité dans sa cellule.
M. Gaeta ?
Que faisiez-vous dans la cellule du
Dr. Baltar au milieu de la nuit ?
Je n'arrivais pas à dormir et j'ai pensé
qu'il voudrait peut-être me parler.
Nous comprenons,
mais laissez-nous l'interroger.
Bien sûr.
Tu veilles tard.
- Au fait, le Chef te salue.
- C'est ton nouveau pote de beuverie ?
Je t'aurais invitée mais tu m'as fait
comprendre que c'est pas ton truc.
Non, c'est <i>ton</i> truc.
Et ce n'était pas ma question.
J'ai un briefing à 5h.
On dîne toujours ensemble demain ?
Merde. Oui.
- J'ai déjà échangé mon tour de garde.
- OK.
Ce serait bien, pour un mari et
une femme, de temps en temps...
Oublie ça.
Merci.
Vous pouvez laisser la porte ouverte.
Bonjour.
<i>Touché</i>, Madame la Présidente.
Je n'ai aucune envie
de vous voir souffrir.
Vraiment ?
Je viens de tester les joies du tube
passé de force dans le nez
jusqu'au fond de la gorge.
Tout le monde doit se nourrir.
C'est pour votre bien.
Et ce n'est rien comparé à ce
que beaucoup des nôtres
ont enduré dans
vos prisons sur New Caprica.
Pas <i>mes</i> prisons.
Celles des Cylons.
Une nuance qui reste théorique, Docteur.
On ne fait pas ça pour s'amuser,
alors pourquoi
ne pas me dire ce que je veux savoir,
et mettre un terme à vos souffrances ?
Et ça je peux vous le promettre.
Je ne connais ni les plans des Cylons,
ni leur localisation.
Je n'ai rien vu dans ce temple.
Mes connaissances sur le
renseignement cylon sont...
... limitées,
c'est le moins qu'on puisse dire.
Avant l'attaque des Colonies, aviez-vous
un accès haute-sécurité ?
- Oui. Et alors ?
- L'avez-vous dit à quelqu'un ?
Avez-vous laissé quelqu'un accéder
au réseau de défense ?
- Attention, Gaius.
- La femme blonde...
avec qui je vous ai vu,
juste avant l'attaque ?
Elle te jettera dans l'espace
sans hésiter une seconde.
À moins, bien sûr...
que cette perspective ne t'effraie
plus désormais.
Mensonges.
Que des mensonges.
Une resucée de tous ces
vieux mensonges.
Je n'ai pas participé...
au génocide de mon propre peuple.
Voici Devlin et Maryanne McAllister,
leur fils et leur fille.
Une famille de quatre personnes
abattues dans leur propre maison
- car suspectée d'aider des insurgés.
- Je ne suis pas responsable.
Je me demandais si vous reconnaîtriez
au moins un de ces visages.
N'avez-vous donc rien vu les rares fois
où vous êtes sorti
de derrière vos sacs de sable
et de vos fils barbelés pour
voir ce qu'endurait votre peuple ?!
Pour voir ce qu'endurait votre peuple ?!
Votre peuple !
Je dois savoir, maintenant !
Colonel Tigh, venez ici !
Faites-le sortir.
Il ne parlera pas.
Emmenez-le. Je veux que vous le
balanciez à travers le premier sas.
Il s'agit maintenant de
payer votre dette !
Gardes ! Venez ici !
- Et mon procès équitable ?
- Sortez-le d'ici !
Lâchez-moi, bordel !
J'exige un procès équitable !
Je suis un citoyen des Colonies
et j'exige un procès équitable !
Un procès équitable !
Regardez bien, Docteur.
Une infime partie de ceux
que vous avez envoyés à la mort.
Ce n'est que justice
qu'ils voient vos derniers pas.
Arrêtez. Stop, attendez ! Arrêtez !
Quoi ?!
Vous me demandiez
si je connaissais ces gens.
- Je connais cet homme.
- Montrez-moi.
Montrez-moi ! Lâchez-le.
Gardez-le en joue.
Cet homme,
Adrian Bauer, c'était mon assistant
sur Caprica pendant 3 ans.
Et alors ?!
Il venait de Gemini. Je lui ai obtenu
un visa. Je lui ai présenté sa femme.
Je suis le parrain de leur aîné.
Je n'aurais jamais pu faire
de mal à lui ou à sa famille.
Ou à toute autre famille.
Je ne suis pas un meurtrier. Je suis
innocent. Pourquoi ne pas me croire ?
Attrapez-le. Emmenez-le !
Vous appelez ça
la justice des Colonies ?
Qu'ai-je fait pour vous ?
À part vous sauver la vie !
Vous avez fait de votre mieux.
- Je comprends.
- L'enfoiré ne veut toujours pas parler.
Ou il a plus de tripes
que je ne pensais, ou bien...
Ou il savait que vous bluffiez.
Eh bien...
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait de lui maintenant ?
Il y a une possibilité.
Amiral ?
L'armée a un jour lancé...
un programme expérimental
d'interrogatoires à l'aide de drogues.
Des hallucinogènes, pour être précis.
Le but du programme était de créer
un état d'angoisse si intense
que le sujet croyait que
sa survie était en jeu.
Les interrogateurs
devaient exploiter ça.
En devenant non plus des adversaires
mais des bouées de sauvetage.
Enfin, c'était l'idée.
Ça pourrait faire parler Baltar...
lui faire dire ce que
les Cylons savent sur la Terre.
Mais c'est dangereux.
En particulier
pour quelqu'un dans son état.
Vous voulez dire
que nous avons ces drogues à bord ?
T'es vraiment un type facile.
C'est ce que tu penses ?
Ton ex, deux fois infidèle,
t'appelle pour un coup vite fait,
et tu sautes dans la première navette ?
Je répondrais oui.
J'ai réfléchi à des trucs, Kara.
Ah, ouais ? Comme quoi ?
Comme...
Ce que Leoben,
ce synthétique taré, a dit sur toi
et ta destinée exceptionnelle.
Et s'il y avait une part de vérité ?
La destinée exceptionnelle
de Kara Thrace ?
Ça ressemble plutôt
à un mauvais roman, Sam.
Réfléchis.
Pourquoi survivre des mois sur Caprica,
en attendant ton retour,
si c'est pour
te laisser tomber ensuite ?
Et toi,
t'as traversé cet enfer, cloîtrée dans
une fausse maison avec un faux mari,
pour finalement me larguer ?
Je ne crois pas.
Tu sais, quand j'y pense comme ça...
Est-ce que tu l'aimes ?
Quoi ?
Lee, Kara.
Est-ce que tu aimes Lee ?
Bons Dieux, Sam...
Peut-être.
Je ne sais pas.
Alors tu dois le retrouver.
Je croyais que t'étais pas de service.
C'est le cas.
J'allais juste faire
un petit tour au bar.
Si tu vas retrouver Kara, dis-le moi.
Écoute, je t'ai dit
qu'il n'y a rien entre nous.
On m'avait dit :
"Lee te trompera pas.
Il est trop honnête."
- Mais c'est des conneries tout ça.
- Tu sais ce que c'est le problème ?
Le problème
c'est que tu ne me crois pas.
C'est ton putain
de manque de confiance qui parle.
Comme d'habitude.
Dès le début,
depuis le jour ou je me suis déclaré...
Tu sais quoi ?
Laisse tomber.
Ça sert à rien, putain.
Non, t'as raison.
Je l'avais vu venir.
Mais j'ai été suffisamment
naïve pour t'épouser quand même.
Tu sais pourquoi, Lee ?
Parce que je t'aimais.
J'étais tellement dingue de toi...
Je pensais avoir de la chance.
C'est ça, de la chance...
de t'avoir, aussi longtemps que toi
ou Kara me le permettraient.
Dee...
Allez, viens là.
C'est pas un mariage, Lee.
C'est un mensonge.
Tu veux être avec Kara ?
Vas-y.
Je ne t'empêcherai pas.
C'est fini.
Attends, où tu vas ?
Sam...
Il faut que j'y aille.
Alors à plus.
Je t'aime.
Je suis un être humain.
Je suis un être humain. J'ai des droits.
Je vous dis que j'ai des droits.
S'il vous plaît.
Aidez-moi.
Je ne suis pas sure de pouvoir, Gaius
La douleur, c'est une chose...
mais ça...
Qu'es-tu, sans ton libre arbitre ?
Dieu peut-il avoir pitié de toi ?
Admettez que vous faites ça
pour votre propre satisfaction.
C'est la vérité, non ? Pourquoi
ne pas faire l'injection vous-même ?
- Tenez sa tête.
- Non.
Mon Dieu.
Ça agit.
Évitez de faire du bruit.
Attachez-lui la tête.
Mon Dieu, où suis-je ?
Qu'est-ce tu veux dire ?
Si je quitte Sam...
... tu quitteras Dee ?
Par les Dieux, Kara.
Je...
Comment je peux être sur que
tu vas pas encore faire volte-face ?
On parle de nos mariages, putain,
pas d'un combat spatial à la con
qu'on peut esquiver.
Penses-y, Lee.
C'est ce que tu fais le mieux.
Où suis-je ?
Mon Dieu, où suis-je ?
<i>Entendez-vous ma voix ?</i>
<i>M'entendez-vous, Docteur ?</i>
Amiral, c'est vous ?
<i>Je suis à votre recherche, Docteur.
Je ne vous trouve pas.
Pouvez-vous nous dire où vous êtes ?
Il y a de l'eau.
Je suis dans l'eau.
C'est froid et sombre.
Je ne vois rien.
Y a-t-il quelque chose qui pourrait
nous indiquer où vous êtes ?
<i>Regardez la lumière. Vous la voyez ?</i>
- Oui.
<i>- Essayez de l'atteindre.
C'est ça.
C'est ça.
C'est ça.
Suivez la lumière.
Caprica...
Caprica Six...
Elle m'a sauvé la vie,
m'a protégé de l'explosion.
Docteur, avez-vous conspiré avec elle
pour saboter notre système de défense ?
La conspiration implique une volonté !
Je n'ai jamais voulu...
Elle a dit qu'au fond de moi,
je le suspectais.
Mais je ne savais pas.
Comment l'aurais-je su ?
Ai-je conspiré ?
Oui ou non ?
Non !
Non.
Je ne sais pas.
Non.
Ce n'était pas ma faute.
Ce n'était pas ma faute !
Je ne suis pas responsable !
Elle...
Caprica Six...
elle m'a choisi.
Parmi tous les hommes.
Choisi pour être séduit,
pris par la main,
guidé entre lumière et obscurité.
Mais est-elle un ange ou un démon ?
Est-elle imaginaire ou réelle ?
Est-elle ma propre voix,
ou la voix de...
Je ne peux pas rester
à la surface plus longtemps !
Alors donnez-nous des détails, Docteur.
Des détails sur les Cylons,
ou nous vous laisserons vous noyer.
Seul... dans l'obscurité.
Salut, Chef.
Pourquoi c'est si difficile, bordel ?
Pourquoi on peut pas juste
revenir à la normale ?
La normale...
Comment se définit la normale ?
Chef, dites-moi
si je dépasse les bornes...
Mais...
Vous pensez jamais à Sharon ?
Non.
Allez.
Vous vous dites jamais : "Et si" ?
Non.
Ne me laissez pas !
Je sais que j'ai failli !
Je n'ai jamais prétendu...
Oui, des erreurs...
Des erreurs terribles ont été commises.
Étaient-ce les miennes ?
Suis-je le seul à blâmer ?
J'étais un exécutant, c'est tout.
Je me débattais,
pour trouver ma place
dans le plan de Dieu.
Dans la volonté de Dieu.
Je n'ai jamais voulu
que ces choses arrivent !
- Ça ne compte pas ?
- Vous avez amené les Cylons au temple.
<i>À l'Œil de Jupiter.
Que leur a-t-il appris ?</i>
Que leur a-t-il appris sur la Terre ?
Je ne cherchais pas...
Que cherchiez-vous, Docteur ?
Que cherchiez-vous ?
Leurs visages,
mais ils ne me les ont pas montrés.
Leurs visages ? À qui ?
Les cinq.
Les cinq derniers.
Les cinq derniers Cylons ?
Je pensais être l'un deux.
Je leur ai dit que
je voulais être l'un deux.
Un Cylon ?
Pourquoi ?
Pour que mes pêchés soient pardonnés.
Un nouveau départ.
Êtes-vous un Cylon, Dr. Baltar ?
Non.
Ce n'est pas suffisant, Docteur.
Dites-moi ce que vous avez dit
aux Cylons.
<i>Que savent-ils ? Dites-le-moi</i>
ou je vous laisserai couler, Docteur.
<i>Je vous laisserai couler.</i>
<i>Dites-le-moi ou
je vous laisserai couler, Docteur.</i>
<i>Je vous laisserai couler.</i>
Regardez où vous allez !
Où est mon alliance ?
Quelqu'un a vu mon alliance ?
Je l'ai perdue.
Quelqu'un a vu mon alliance ?
Où elle est ?
Amiral, on est en train de le perdre.
Ça suffit.
J'arrête ce cirque immédiatement !
Écoutez ça.
"Cinq derniers modèles cylons.
"Cinq piliers dans le temple,
"pour les cinq prêtres
"servant Celui dont
on ne peut dire le nom."
Voyons, c'est juste du folklore.
Il ne dit pas tout, Amiral.
J'en suis sûre.
Alors on devrait peut-être utiliser
des méthodes plus directes.
Des méthodes directes,
là je suis avec vous.
Non.
On a essayé le bâton.
Il est temps d'essayer la carotte.
Ce qu'il craint le plus,
c'est qu'on le tue même s'il parle.
Il est pas bête.
Il faut le rassurer.
Lui faire croire que s'il collabore
on lui laissera au moins la vie.
Il n'y croira pas, venant de nous.
Bien sûr que non.
Il faut trouver quelqu'un
en qui il a confiance.
Aussi tordu que ça puisse paraître,
peut-être que je leur dois ma gratitude.
Je réalise qu'il n'y a rien
que je puisse dire qui effacera ça.
Mais tu dois savoir quelque chose.
Je t'ai demandée en mariage
parce que je t'aimais.
Tout comme je t'aime aujourd'hui.
Ils m'ont forcé...
à admettre mes défaillances.
<i>Maintenant que je l'ai fait,
je me sens positivement libéré.</i>
Tu avais raison,
j'aimais Kara.
Et il y a peut-être une partie de moi
qui l'aimera toujours.
Dans mon cœur,
je sais que j'ai toujours fait...
ce que je devais faire.
Mais je t'ai épousée, toi.
Je t'ai épousée.
Et tu sais,
quand je repense à notre mariage,
au temps qu'on a passé ensemble,
tu me rends meilleur, Dee.
Et j'ai besoin de toi.
Et je pense que
je ne l'ai jamais vraiment réalisé,
jusqu'à ce que je risque de te perdre.
Je ne peux pas vous promettre
un procès, Docteur.
Mais je suis sûr que si vous leur donnez
quelque chose... quoi que ce soit...
Mais je t'en prie, donne-moi une autre
chance. C'est tout ce que je demande.
Donne-moi une autre chance.
<i>Les cartes que j'utilise
pour tracer notre route vers la Terre.</i>
<i>Je n'ai jamais eu confiance
dans mes calculs.</i>
Heureusement, parce qu'ils sont faux.
Je détecte déjà un certain
nombre de contradictions. Voyez,
ces chiffres sont faux.
C'est bien ce que je craignais.
Les systèmes de navigation cylons
sont bien plus avancés que les nôtres,
mais j'ai réussi à mémoriser
beaucoup de leurs algorithmes.
Si vous pouvez
leur offrir ce genre d'aide,
je suis sûr qu'au moins
ils épargneront votre vie.
On peut peut-être même
vous faire sortir de cette cellule,
et vous offrir
des quartiers convenables.
Le confort matériel,
voilà le facteur décisif.
Pardon ?
Où est-il ?
- Où est quoi, Docteur ?
- "Où est quoi ?"
Dommage pour notre petit stratagème.
Salut.
Ça va ?
On n'est pas obligés de rester
si tu ne le veux pas, OK ?
Ouais.
Deux whiskies, et que ça saute !
J'aurais dû savoir
que vous me trahiriez.
Que leur avez-vous dit ?
Que vous êtes resté à l'abri jusqu'à
cette fin terrible sur New Caprica,
afin de quoi ? Afin de...
fournir des informations
à la résistance ?
Qui vous a permis
de faire ça à votre avis ?
- C'est un mensonge.
- Non.
Vous me croyez aveugle ?
J'avais littéralement une arme
pointée sur ma tête.
Mais personne ne vous a forcé
à jouer sur les deux tableaux.
Alors je vous le demande,
Monsieur Gaeta...
qui est le véritable traître
dans cette pièce ?
Au premier d'une longue série.
- Un autre.
- Ouais.
Merci.
Je ne suis pas un traître.
<i>Non, bien sûr,
car il y a bien pire qu'être un traître.</i>
<i>N'est-ce pas, Félix ?</i>
Si vos amis avaient su la vérité.
Ne vous inquiétez pas.
On doit intervenir.
Lâche-moi !
Va te faire foutre !
Lt. Gaeta, éloignez-vous
immédiatement du prisonnier !
Éloignez-vous du prisonnier.
Je ne le répèterai pas.
Baissez votre arme, Sergent.
- Reculez, Monsieur Gaeta.
- Non, Monsieur.
Je ne peux pas le laisser vivre.
Pas après ce qu'il a fait.
Monsieur Gaeta...
Monsieur Gaeta, attendez. Regardez-moi.
Je comprends ce que vous ressentez.
- Non.
- Si.
L'autre nuit, vous n'êtes pas venu ici
pour interroger le Dr Baltar.
Vous êtes venu le tuer, n'est-ce pas ?
Je vous comprends. Vraiment.
- Quel est son état ?
- Il a raté l'artère, il survivra.
On doit l'emmener à l'infirmerie.
Apportez un brancard immédiatement.
Doucement avec lui.
Tout bien considéré, Gaius,
ça aurait pu être pire.
Bien pire.
Et même si tu n'es pas un des Cinq,
tu as certainement la chance des Dieux.
Je suis l'élu.
Tu ne leur as pas dit ça, hein ?
Non.
Tout le monde a son petit secret.
Je lui ai dit que je ne tirais
aucune satisfaction à le voir souffrir.
Mais en vérité, je voulais le voir
endurer les pires tourments,
afin d'obtenir ce que je voulais.
Plus qu'aucune information
ou quelque vérité
je voulais un véritable
aveu de culpabilité.
Vous n'obtiendrez pas ça
de quelqu'un comme Baltar.
Il ne se voit pas comme ça.
Il n'est pas comme ça.
À ses yeux...
il est la victime.
Pas le criminel.
Il n'est pas trop tard pour lui...
de disparaître.
On ne peut pas faire ça.
Malgré tous ses crimes,
il est l'un des nôtres.
Alors que va-t-il se passer ?
On lui accorde son procès.
Doucement.
Merci.
Nous savons que Baltar n'est pas
vraiment impliqué dans l'attaque et...
nous avons besoin d'en savoir plus.
Et moi j'ai besoin de savoir que
je ne serai pas jetée dans l'espace.
Non, vous avez ma parole.
La même que vous avez donnée à Leoben
avant de l'envoyer dans l'espace ?
Il nous l'a dit.

LES CYLONS FURENT CRÉÉS PAR L'HOMME
ILS SE RÉVOLTÈRENT
ILS ÉVOLUÈRENT
IL Y A DE NOMBREUSES COPIES
ET ILS ONT UN PLAN
Précédemment dans
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA
On a tous fait des sacrifices.
- Ah oui ?
- Oui, tout à fait.
Alors comment ça se fait qu'un graisseur
de Cylons occupe mon poste ?
Héra est en vie. Je suis sa
mère et je vais la récupérer.
Je te supplie de le faire.
Vous avez mis toute la flotte
en danger, vous en êtes conscient ?
Je ne suis pas un traître.
J'ai fait ce qui me semblait juste.
- Elle va récupérer Héra.
- Allons-y.
- Ne tirez pas !
- Sortez de là !
Jetez-moi cette chose en prison.
Je réclame le droit,
en tant que citoyen des Colonies,
à un avocat
et à une procédure ordinaire.
- Ah oui ?
- Alors que va-t-il se passer ?
On lui accorde son procès.
Ils pensent vraiment pouvoir entasser
plus de civils sur le pont tribord ?
C'est pour ça qu'Helo a été affecté ici,
pour s'occuper des réfugiés.
Nous avons le décompte des occupants du
Thera Sita qui embarquent.
- 51 Sagittariens.
- Eh ben...
Helo risque d'être débordé.
La nuit a été rude, non ?
Eh ! Je disais
que t'avais pas bien dormi.
Un rêve idiot, peu importe.
- Alors, ça va ?
- Ouais.
Ils vont rajouter 300 personnes
en bas, mais tout va bien.
Oui, je ne sais pas où
je vais les mettre, mais
ça ne me stresse pas plus que ça.
Je vais bien.
- Eh, le voilà !
- N'est-ce pas le maire de Clebsville ?
Lâchez-le un peu, les gars.
Il paraît que t'as
un nouvel arrivage de loyaux sujets.
Helo, viens ici.
J'ai un service à te demander.
Ce soir, j'ai rencard avec un beau mec
que je veux dresser. Tu saisis ?
Tu pourrais me dégotter une de
tes petites niches douillettes en bas ?
- À plus tard, Helo.
- Ouais, vous savez où me trouver.
- Tu fais attention à Héra, d'accord ?
- Oui, je ferai attention.
Je t'aime aussi.
Continuez à avancer.
S'il vous plaît, avancez.
Je sais, je sais.
On va s'en occuper.
Allez, avancez.
Bienvenue à bord du Galactica.
Je suis le Capitaine Karl Agathon.
Je suis ici pour veiller
à votre bien-être. On va s'en occuper.
- Pour l'instant, avancez.
- Où vont les Sagittariens ?
La répartition n'est pas encore définie.
Continuez.
- On veut être ensemble.
- Vous l'avez entendu ?
Bougez vos fesses. Allez !
J'ai la situation
sous contrôle, Colonel.
Ouais, j'en doute pas.
Excusez-moi. Madame,
je peux jeter un oeil à votre fils ?
Non, tout va bien.
On n'a pas besoin d'un docteur.
Je sais.
On n'a pas besoin de docteur.
On est Sagittariens.
On ne croit pas en la médecine.
Tout va bien, Madame.
Le Dr Robert est notre médecin civil.
Il n'a rien à voir avec les soldats.
Nous respecterons vos traditions.
Vous pouvez me faire confiance,
je suis sagittarienne.
- Ça va aller.
- D'accord ?
Ça va aller.
Vous sentez ça ?
Pouvez-vous ouvrir la bouche ?
En grand.
Parfait.
Regardez ça.
Vous sentez quelque chose ?
- Et là ?
- Bien, ça suffit. Merci.
- Ne me touchez pas !
- C'est assez...
- Merci beaucoup, Kim.
- On se calme.
- Monsieur...
- Surtout, ne le touchez pas.
- D'accord.
- Bien.
Mike, sale tricheur.
Tu me dois toujours un verre.
- Saul, sors d'ici tout de suite.
- T'es de bonne humeur aujourd'hui.
Doc, je sais pas, mais
certaines personnes ont l'air...
- Malade.
- Malade, ouais.
Toubib !
- Dr. Robert !
- Pars, Saul.
Non, ne touchez pas mon fils.
- Où ils l'amènent ?
- Tout va bien, Madame...

Alors, à quoi on a affaire, Mike ?
Syndrome de Mellorak.
Ça commence dans les reins
avant d'attaquer rapidement les
systèmes respiratoires et immunitaires.
Une vraie saloperie.
Si vous ne traitez pas
les premiers symptômes sous 48 heures,
ça vous tue en trois à cinq jours.
C'est contagieux ?
Ça ne se transmet pas par voie aérienne,
c'est une chance.
Ça se transmet par contact.
Par la salive,
les rapports sexuels, par la peau.
Pour le moment,
ça semble restreint aux Sagittariens.
C'est bien, qu'ils gardent ça pour eux.
De toute évidence,
ça se répand là où on travaillait.
- Ça se soigne ?
- Absolument, oui.
Une dose de Bitamusine
et vous êtes sur pieds en deux jours.
Et les sédatifs réduisent les symptômes.
Mais je sais pas combien de temps
notre stock tiendra.
On devrait l'économiser en l'injectant
seulement après les premiers signes.
Ça touche des civils, Dr. Robert.
C'est entre vos mains.
Mais je veux Tyrol et l'équipage
immunisés avant qu'ils tombent malades.
J'ai pas besoin d'arrêt-maladie.
Si on désinfecte tout et
qu'on insiste sur l'hygiène,
certains éviteront la maladie
et n'auront pas besoin de remède.
On ne devrait pas
tous les envoyer à la douche ?
Surtout les Sagittariens.
On pourrait faire une annonce.
Non, nous ne voulons pas...
les isoler encore davantage.
On aurait une émeute sur les bras.
Si ça dépendait que de moi, je dirais
d'installer les Sagittariens
et de s'occuper ensuite
des civils déjà arrivés.
Au moins, on n'aura pas à s'inquiéter
d'avoir assez de médicaments
- pour les Sagittariens.
- La plupart d'entre eux les refuseront.
Des gens vont mourir.
Pendant 3 000 ans,
la médecine a été leur épouvantail.
Parce que ce sont des crétins
bornés et des suceurs de racines
qui s'accrochent
à des traditions millénaires.
Buvez ça.
Ça pue assez pour vous ici ?
C'est vrai que ça empeste.
C'est la racine de bardane.
Les Sagittariens s'en servent
comme sédatif.
- Ça marche ?
- J'en sais rien.
Ils vont mourir de toute façon.
Dites-moi qu'il n'y aura pas de procès.
Gaius Baltar sera jugé
pour crimes et trahison.
Un tribunal entendra
les preuves contre lui.
Un verdict sera rendu.
Il sera déclaré coupable,
et devra enfin rendre compte
de ses actions.
Si vous pouvez faire preuve,
comme moi, d'un peu de patience
nous traverserons cette épreuve.
Écoutez-moi.
Baltar aura son procès,
et voilà ce que vous aurez.
Un ouragan.
Les médias vont vous tomber dessus,
observer,
scruter et questionner chacune
de vos actions. Vous aurez...
des violences sectaires
Vous aurez des tentatives d'assassinats.
Vous aurez des troubles civils
d'une ampleur jamais vue.
Le travail, le train-train
quotidien de la flotte s'arrêteront net.
Ce procès
va complètement détruire cette flotte.
M. le Vice-président,
nos mesures de sécurité prévoient
le déploiement rapide de marines,
des patrouilles de Vipers,
des détachements de sécurité...
Un ouragan, Laura.
À votre place,
je décrèterais la loi martiale
durant le procès.
Vous aurez besoin de plus
qu'un peu de patience pour survivre.
Je suis là si vous avez besoin de moi.
Ton meilleur ami
et ton pire ennemi.
Je ne l'ai jamais vu ainsi.
Il était vraiment effrayé.
Nous ne sommes pas malades.
Les Sagitt' ont ramené cette maladie
avec eux. Renvoyez-les !
Bien monsieur.
Où dois-je les renvoyer ?
Je ne sais pas.
Démerdez-vous.
Bien, vos craintes ont été notées.
- Nous allons faire de notre mieux.
- Ouais, c'est ça.
Puis-je vous aider ?
Mon fils est mort.
Je suis désolé.
Un bracelet en soma, c'est ça ?
Vous autres, Sagittariens, pensez
que ça garantit une bonne santé ?
Je suis désolé, mais c'est insuffisant.
Si on ne traite pas la maladie,
elle est mortelle, OK ?
- Ce n'était pas inévitable.
- Si, ça l'était.
Il a été tué.
Non Madame, il est mort.
Il est mort parce
qu'il lui fallait de vrais soins.
Il est mort parce que
j'ai fait une erreur.
Oui.
Oui, bien.
Dites-le aux autres.
Je le ferai. Je leur dirai
de ne pas lui faire confiance.
Ils m'avaient prévenue,
mais je n'ai pas voulu écouter.
Je ne voulais pas
que mon fils meure.
J'ai tenté ma chance.
Je suis allée voir le Dr Robert.
J'ai laissé le docteur...
donner des médicaments à Willie.
Madame...
vous avez attendu trop longtemps.
Willie était malade
depuis moins de 12 heures.
Il avait 19 ans.
Il est mort.
Ce médecin...
a tué mon fils.
Ils en ont perdu un autre cette nuit.
- Willie King.
- Non.
Une fillette de trois ans à qui
ses parents ont refusé mes soins.
La mère de Willie King
a perdu Willie King.
Quel gâchis. Il était condamné.
Vous l'avez vu à son arrivée. Il était
atteint depuis au moins 3 jours.
Vous l'avez expliqué à la mère ?
Je l'ai fait bien sûr.
Qu'est-ce que je devais lui dire ?
"Désolé Madame, mais si vous aviez
"tourné le dos un peu plus tôt
"à vos superstitions à la con,
on aurait pu sauver votre fils ?"
Enlevez votre chemise, voulez-vous ?
- Pardon ?
- Je vais vous vacciner.
Je vais bien.
Je croyais qu'on rationnait.
Vous croyez que je vais attendre que
vous soyez couché pour une journée ?
- Qui d'autre va m'aider ici ?
- D'accord.
J'ai parlé à Tigh.
Il demandait de vos nouvelles.
J'ai dit que vous faisiez
un sacré boulot.
Je ne souhaiterais
cette place à personne.
Allons-y, vous êtes prêt ?
Ça risque de piquer un peu.
C'est bon pour vous.
Alors, championne,
fais voir ce que tu vaux.
Mets-le dans le trou, Marge.
Tu veux connaître mon secret, Connor ?
J'imagine que ce truc
c'est ta gueule.
Voilà Monsieur Mellorak.
Tous aux abris.
Relax, le doc m'a fait une injection.
On dit que c'est plutôt dur là-bas ?
Seulement si on est Sagittarien.
Mourir, ça semble tellement insensé.
Ouais, et bien on me fera
pas verser une larme.
C'est déjà assez dur que mes gars aient
à trimer dans leur puanteur.
J'ai l'impression
qu'on va se réveiller un jour
furieux de plus avoir de médocs,
parce que ces débiles auront compris,
et qu'on aura dû partager.
Tu causes ou tu tires ?
Aucun de ces fanatiques n'a bougé
le petit doigt sur New Caprica
contre les Cylons.
- Chef, fermez-la.
- Beaucoup de résistants sont morts.
J'ai dit de la fermer, compris ?
- Pardon, Dee.
- C'est rien.
J'ai plus de raisons que toi de leur
en vouloir, je suis sagittarienne.
La plupart d'entre eux sont paranos,
têtus et pinailleurs.
C'est sûr qu'ils mènent
la vie dure au Dr Robert.
La médecine est une abomination.
C'est un péché contre les Dieux.
Les médecins répandent les maladies
car ils refusent d'admettre que le corps
- Bien joué.
- ... et l'esprit sont des mythes.
Eh bien, ce corps n'est pas un mythe.
Si je tombe malade,
j'irais voir le Dr Robert.
Tu ne tomberas pas malade.
N'importe qui sauf Cottle.
Ce bâtard borné.
Il pourrait aussi bien utiliser une lance
plutôt qu'une aiguille.
Alors, ils te traitent bien ?
Oui, je n'ai pas à me plaindre.
Mais ils prennent leur temps
pour entrer dans le vif du sujet, non ?
Écoute, Six...
Je veux te remercier
pour ce que tu as fait.
Même si je ne sais pas encore
pourquoi tu l'as fait.
Précisément.
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ici ?
Comment as-tu bien pu te mettre
à la merci de ces gens ?
- Et maintenant, tu es ici.
- Oui.
Ta meilleure chance
de survivre est de collaborer.
Et ça veut dire les aider à
confondre Baltar pour ses crimes.
Je dois y aller. Alors...
je vais te trouver des vêtements.
S'il te plait, prends soin de toi.
Merci de ta visite.
De m'avoir tenu compagnie.
Merci.
Je tiens à toi.
Tu penses qu'un seul
d'entre eux se soucie de toi ?
Je ne crois pas.
Alors, qu'est-ce que tu fais là déjà ?
Je me le demande encore.
Tu es là pour le sauver, n'est-ce pas ?
Je t'ai dit, je ne sais pas.
Tu es là...
car tu veux être humaine.
Mais il y a un truc pour être humain.
Tu ne dois penser...
qu'à toi-même.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle fait maintenant,
à votre avis ?
Je ne sais pas.
Comme si elle parlait à quelque chose
ou à quelqu'un. Je l'ai déjà vu faire.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Reculez !
Reculez !
Il veut nous tuer !
C'est un assassin.
Reculez !
Attrapez-le !
- Reculez !
- C'est lui !
Le Dr Robert, il les a tués !
Lâchez-moi !
Reculez !
Tout le monde dégage maintenant !
Que tout le monde recule !
Lâchez-le immédiatement !
Reculez !
Reculez !
Reculez immédiatement !
Il a tué mon père !
J'ai essayé de l'aider,
espèce de malade !
Lâchez-moi !
Restez derrière moi.
Vous avez vacciné le vieil homme
mais il est quand même mort ?
Buckminster et son père
sont des intégristes.
Qu'est-ce qui leur a fait changer d'avis
sur le vaccin ?
Changer d'avis ?
Qui a dit qu'ils avaient changé d'avis ?
J'ai injecté la Bitamusine
de mon propre chef.
Sans leur accord ?
Écoutez, c'était le milieu de la nuit,
je faisais ma ronde,
et le vieillard hurlait de douleur.
J'étais censé faire quoi ?
Je ne comprends pas.
On ne rationne plus ?
C'était bien après les 48 heures.
C'est vrai,
mais ce n'est pas une limite exacte.
Tout le monde est différent.
OK, il était limite. Écoutez,
je ne vais pas rester ici
à m'excuser de faire mon travail.
J'ai deux Picons qui commencent
à montrer des symptômes
et je vais aller les soigner
si ça ne vous fait rien.
L'horaire du traitement
avancé par le docteur
diffère grandement de celui de Mme King.
De qui ?
La femme,
celle dont je vous ai parlé, Mme King.
Elle a emmené son fils au Dr Robert
dès les premiers symptômes.
Le garçon est mort quand même.
Dans l'autre cas, Robert a soigné
un Sagittarien sans son consentement.
On aurait dû faire ça
pour tout le monde dès le début.
La maladie aurait disparu maintenant.
Si on ne l'a pas fait, c'est pour
respecter les coutumes des Sagittariens.
Justement,
il ne les a pas respectées !
Des gens pourraient
mourir sous les soins de Robert.
Comme chaque jour sous mes soins.
Ça va de pair avec ce maudit boulot.
- Pas le meurtre.
- Le meurtre ?
Vous dépassez les bornes.
Mike Robert mérite mieux que ça.
Même si j'ai tort et qu'il respecte
l'éthique médicale en soignant ces gens,
je crains
qu'il n'ait créé un problème là-bas.
C'est mauvais.
Capitaine...
J'ai un ancien
Président des Colonies en cellule,
une Cylon en détention,
et une population qui ne rêve que
de les mettre en pièce tous les deux.
Le vaisseau est surpeuplé,
et j'ai une épidémie sur les bras.
Maintenant, la question est :
êtes-vous capable
de faire votre travail ?
Et allez-vous arrêter
de lancer ces accusations infondées ?
Alors ?
Oui, Monsieur.
Rompez.
Agathon !
Pourquoi
vous ne laissez pas tomber, Helo ?
Foutez la paix au Doc.
- Ça ne vous apportera rien de bon.
- Sauf votre respect,
Monsieur,
je crois que Mike Robert
peut blesser ces gens.
C'est le seul qui ait jamais dit
du bien de vous
d'aussi loin que je me souvienne.
Vous auriez autant pu prendre
le peu de crédibilité qui vous reste
et la balancer par un sas.
Vous voulez sérieusement vous battre
pour ces putains de tarés ?
C'est quoi votre problème ?
Vous aimez juste être tenu à l'écart,
n'est-ce pas ?
Je vois pas où vous voulez en venir,
à moins que vous ne parliez de ma femme,
encore une fois.
Mike Robert est quelqu'un de réglo.
C'est un Caprican, un des nôtres.
Un homme de confiance.
Sur New Caprica,
il était dans la résistance.
Il a soigné mon oeil
et combattu l'ennemi,
pendant que vous passiez chaque nuit,
tendrement enlacés avec votre Cylon...
Colonel !
C'est rien ! Dégagez !
Ça va ?
Donc...
vous vous souciez
de ce que pensent vos amis.
Tant mieux !
C'est dans votre intérêt.
Mais vous savez quoi ?
Je m'en soucie aussi.
De l'amitié, de la loyauté.
Continuez de salir la réputation
de Mike Robert et on se retrouvera.
Qu'est-ce que vous en dites ?
Vous feriez bien de faire examiner
cette main par le Doc.
Désolé, mais vous allez devoir attendre.
Pardon, laissez passer.
15 minutes, messieurs-dames.
Je reviens dans 15 minutes. Désolé.
Laissez passer, s'il vous plait.
Monsieur, laissez-moi.
- Sharon !
- Helo !
- Quoi de neuf ?
- Comment va Héra ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
Elle est malade, depuis une heure.
Je suis dispensée de patrouille.
Qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?
On m'a rien dit.
On l'a emmenée voir le Dr Robert.
Attendez, je suis pas sûr
qu'elle ait besoin de ça.
C'est sérieux, elle peut en mourir.
Allez, on y va.
Ça va aller. Regarde par ici.
C'est ton doudou.
Gentille fille.
Ce sont des comprimés sédatifs.
Un demi comprimé réduit en poudre,
toutes les 6 heures.
- OK.
- OK ?
- Elle ira mieux ?
- Oui, ça devrait aller.
- Vous pouvez la ramener à la maison.
- Merci, Docteur.
Au revoir !
D'accord ? Au revoir !
C'est fini, dis au revoir.
Au revoir.
Elle ira bien.
D'accord ?
OK.
Vous voulez bien donner ça
à Mme King ? C'est...
C'était à son fils.
Je sais qu'elle voulait le récupérer.
OK ?
Bonjour.
Le Dr Robert m'a confié ça pour vous.
Il vous l'a donné ?
Comment va votre fille ?
Bien, merci.
Tant mieux.
Mme King !
S'il vous plait.
J'ai besoin de savoir une chose.
Si vous pensiez le Dr Robert dangereux,
pourquoi le laisser soigner votre fils ?
Vous étiez prévenue.
Je ne pensais pas qu'on puisse
avoir autant de haine en soi.
- Mais vous comprenez bien que...
- Je ne veux plus en parler...
Parler ne fera pas revenir Willie.
Vous devriez partir, maintenant.
Mme King, je...
Je suis désolé.
T'as l'air furieux.
Non, c'est juste...
ma mission.
C'est normal que tu détestes ça.
Et c'est normal de l'admettre.
C'est pas ça.
Je sais que ma mission craint.
J'ai pas besoin qu'on me le rappelle.
OK.
- C'est quoi, alors ?
- Écoute...
c'est ce que je vois
tous les jours, OK ?
- C'est dur de détourner le regard.
- De quoi ?
- Parle-moi, Karl.
- Je sais pas. J'arrête pas...
J'arrête pas de voir le mal partout.
Peut-être que Tigh a raison.
Peut-être que je suis comme ça.
Et si on m'avait cloué au sol,
non pas parce que
je suis l'homme de la situation,
mais pour punir le gars dont tout le
monde sait qu'il a dépassé les bornes ?
Peut-être que
je suis à ma place à Clebsville.
Tu veux dire...
Laisse tomber.
Comment ça "Laisse tomber" ?
Ça veut dire que c'est ton boulot
de t'occuper de ces gens. Donc, fais-le.
Tu sais quoi ?
T'as raison. C'est moi.
Je me fais un putain de film.
J'ai pas dit ça.
- Où tu vas ?
- Je sais pas.
Doc ?
Vous devriez essayer un lit, Helo.
C'est mieux pour dormir.
Il est en train de les tuer.
Tout est là.
Sortez immédiatement votre cul d'ici,
avant que je demande au patron
de vous enfermer et de jeter la clé.
Non, écoutez-moi.
Il les a tués sur New Caprica.
Regardez.
Ce type a consulté pour une toux,
il est mort d'un arrêt cardiaque.
Voyez vous-même.
Celle-là avait une simple appendicite.
Elle est morte sur la table d'opération.
Sur tous les Picons traités,
12 % sont morts.
Les Capricans... Oh, il aime
les Capricans. 6 % de mortalité.
Les Sagittariens, 90 %.
90 % des Sagittariens
qu'il a soignés sont morts.
Je ne veux pas en entendre plus,
vous saisissez ?
Ce type est débordé.
Il prend pour cible les Sagittariens !
- Ça ne vous fait rien ?
- Que fait-il...
- Docteur, ça ne vous fait rien ?
- Que fait-il exactement ?
Je sais pas. Je suis pas docteur...
Le premier truc sensé
qui sort de votre bouche.
Je pense
qu'il ne leur donne pas le médicament.
Il leur fait quelque chose !
Bon sang,
vous ne lâcherez pas le morceau ?
Je vous en prie,
autopsiez le fils de Mme King,
pour voir de quoi il est mort.
J'arrêterai. Je vous promets que
je laisserai tomber si vous vérifiez.
Je l'ai fait.
J'ai autopsié son fils.
La maladie de Mellorak.
Et j'ai trouvé de la Bitamusine.
C'est bon ? Maintenant ça suffit.
Laissez tomber et dégagez d'ici !
Bonjour, Doc.
Je ne me sens pas très bien.
Je pourrais avoir de la Bitamusine ?
Qui c'est ?
Tout va bien, Héra.
- Mme King ?
- Votre amie,
le soldat, Dualla, elle est malade.
Elle est allée voir le docteur.
- Du calme. Quoi ?
- Non, écoutez-moi.
On en a encore perdu deux cette nuit.
Des Sagittariens
qui ont laissé cet assassin les soigner.
Vous devez faire quelque chose.
Excuse-moi, qu'est-ce qu'elle fait là ?
- La voilà.
- Madame,
vous n'avez rien à faire là.
Allons-y maintenant.
Désolé, Capitaine.
Putain de réfugiés.
Je ne sais pas comment
elle s'est faufilée.
Bonne journée, Monsieur.
Non.
- N'y pense même pas.
- Sharon, c'est Dualla.
- Dualla est là-bas.
- Elle a un mari.
- Ouais, il est en train de patrouiller.
- Elle va s'en sortir.
Elle va se soigner...
Elle s'en sortira.
Tu sais ce qu'il y a sur ce vaisseau ?
Toi et les Sagittariens.
Comment tu peux les écouter ?
C'est mon boulot.
Ils meurent parce qu'il refusent
de se soigner, Karl.
Tu veux que je les ignore, c'est ça ?
Notre fille va bien,
c'est tout ce qui compte ?
- Non !
- Ou alors
tant qu'on déteste les Sagittariens,
on oublie que t'es un Cylon
pendant 5 minutes ?
Ferme ta gueule.
Oui, je veux que tu les ignores.
Je dois me battre tous les jours
pour être acceptée.
Ça n'a rien à voir avec toi ! OK ?
Tu penses que c'est ce que
je suis devenu ? Ce qui me définit ?
Le gars marié à une Cylon ?
Ce mec est louche. Je pense que
c'est un menteur et qu'il tue des gens
parce que c'est un putain de raciste.
Laissez passer ! Écartez-vous !
Dee ?
Dualla ?
Non, non, non !
Dualla !
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Je suis venue voir le Dr Robert...
il m'a donné quelque chose
qui m'a méchamment assommée.
- Où est Lee ?
- On va aller le voir, viens.
- Je t'emmène voir Cottle.
- Non.
- Si, allez, viens.
- Il a la main dure.
- Je sais, viens.
- Qu'est-ce que vous faites ici ?
Elle vient avec moi.
Non, elle n'est pas
en état d'aller où que ce soit.
Je l'emmène voir Cottle pour être sûr.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez dire...
Allez-vous-en d'ici !
Putain, poussez-vous de mon chemin,
Docteur. Maintenant !
- Viens, Dee, viens.
- Non.
Sécurité !
Agathon, il a perdu la tête.
Il fait du mal à l'une de mes patientes.
Vous l'avez empoisonnée.
Je l'emmène voir Cottle.
- Appelez le XO.
- Laisse-moi tranquille.
Non, pas Cottle. Laisse-moi tranquille.
Capitaine, qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- Laisse-moi tranquille.
- Capitaine !
- Je veux dormir.
- Non, viens.
Capitaine, elle ne veut pas y aller !
- Elle dit qu'elle ne veut pas y aller.
- Lâchez-moi, Sergent !
Lâchez-moi !
Virez-moi cette arme, Sergent !
Du calme !
Je ne sais pas contre quoi
vous êtes en croisade
ou qui vous voulez impressionner,
mais ça ne marche pas du tout.
Vous êtes en train de les tuer, Robert.
Je le sais !
Reculez.
Saul.
Tu m'avais dit qu'il était barge,
- mais pas qu'il était danger...
- La ferme !
Comment va-t-elle ?
Elle a été droguée mais elle va bien.
Attends un peu,
tu ne le crois pas, hein ?
Il est en plein délire.
Il a besoin d'aide.
Ouais, et on aurait dû lui en donner.
- Doc ?
- Je n'ai vérifié le sang de Willie
qu'il y a quelques heures.
J'étais épuisé,
et j'admets que les Sagittariens
m'ont agacé au plus haut point.
Et je ne voulais pas me dresser
contre un collègue
mais vous aviez raison
pour les rapports, Helo.
Il n'y avait pas de Bitamusine
dans le corps du fils King.
- Il est mort car il était trop tard.
- Non !
Il est mort
de destruction cellulaire aiguë.
On lui a injecté
du bisphosphonate toxique.
À l'évidence, vous vous êtes trompé.
Je ne vois pas de quoi ces gens...
Non ! Le vieil homme, M. Buckminster,
est mort de la même chose.
Il n'y avait pas de Bitamusine
dans son système.
Vous l'avez tué, espèce de cinglé.
Vous devriez me remercier à genoux
d'avoir sauvé la vie de votre fille !
Et d'avoir les médicaments qui ont
guéri sa maladie.
Vous savez combien cette maladie
est douloureuse à la fin,
et ils ne veulent pas de notre aide.
Pourquoi gaspiller du temps,
des médicaments et de la place pour eux
au lieu de les donner
à ceux qui le méritent vraiment ?
À qui donner un traitement quand il n'y
en a pas assez pour tout le monde...
le Sagittarien qui ne lèverait pas le
petit doigt pour sauver sa propre race
ou le pilote de Viper ?
Que faites-vous de votre serment,
Docteur ?
Je suis intervenu parce que quelqu'un
doit faire les choix difficiles ici.
Mais ça n'a pas d'importance.
Regardez-les.
Ils allaient se détruire eux-mêmes
de toute façon. Regardez-les.
Ils sont comme des vers
rampant sur un rocher brûlant.
Tu te souviens de ce que tu disais,
Saul ?
"À part un Cylon, y a-t-il une chose
que tu hais plus qu'un Sagittarien ?"
Je vais te dire ce que je hais, Mike.
Me tromper.
Capitaine Agathon.
- Monsieur ?
- Arrêtez ce fils de pute.
Bâillonnez-le au besoin.
Avec plaisir, Monsieur.
Je ne lui ai pas fait de mal.
Oui, elle faisait partie des bons.
Monsieur, vous vouliez me voir ?
Oui, Capitaine.
Asseyez-vous, je vous prie.
Il y a la haine,
et il y a permettre la haine.
Deux faces d'une même pièce, en fait.
Nous sommes coupables des deux.
Quelque part, nous nous sommes perdus.
Vous étiez une voix solitaire
dans le désert,
ça pouvait rester comme ça un moment.
C'est mon vaisseau.
Et je vous dois des excuses.
- Ce n'est pas nécessaire, Monsieur.
- Ça ne change rien...
vous les avez quand même.
Ça sera tout, Capitaine.
Et maintenant une scène bonus
de l'épisode de ce soir.
Amiral.
Les Cylons infectés.
C'était moi.
J'ai inversé le purificateur d'air
et ils...
ont étouffé.
Vous êtes sûr de vouloir parler de ça,
Capitaine ?
Oui, Monsieur.

ILS ÉVOLUÈRENT
IL Y A DE NOMBREUSES COPIES
ET ILS ONT UN PLAN
<i>Précédemment dans</i>
Battlestar Galactica
Félicitations pour votre promotion,
Capitaine.
Désolé de ne pas y avoir été.
Merci, Monsieur.
Comment va ta mère ?
Elle s'est remariée.
Dans les montagnes au Nord,
il y a un petit ruisseau.
L'eau y est si claire qu'on croirait
regarder à travers une vitre.
Je pense y construire une cabane.
Tu t'es disputé avec Cally ?
T'as rien entendu ?
On aurait pu vendre des billets.
Au mariage !
La raison d'être des bars.
Il n'est pas trop tard, pour Baltar...
de disparaître.
On ne peut pas faire ça.
Malgré tous ses crimes,
il est l'un des nôtres.
Alors que va-t-il se passer ?
On lui accorde son procès.
<i>- Une visite du Colonel Tigh, Amiral.</i>
- Qu'il entre.
Tu es bien matinal.
Impossible de dormir,
alors j'ai pensé à me rendre utile.
Bon anniversaire, Bill.
Ça va aller.
Ça va aller.
Je sais pas... Vérifie, tu veux bien ?
Papa fait des progrès.
Papa en a marre
de se brûler les poignets.
Je me prépare.
On est de service ce matin.
Je croyais
qu'on passait la journée avec Nicky.
Ouais, moi aussi, avant que
Laskin et Perry se fassent porter pâles.
Ça va aller.
Donc...
tu nous as proposés pour les remplacer ?
On a presque pas eu de congés.
Cally, tu sais bien
qu'on est en sous-effectif.
On est en sous-effectif
depuis qu'on est là.
Ces foutues nourrices
voient plus souvent Nicky que nous.
Tant que les nourrices sauront pas
démonter un Viper, ça sera comme ça.
Allez mon p'tit pote, viens par ici.
Oui, je sais, je sais.
Tu viens juste de t'installer.
Viens par là. Voilà.
Et voilà.
Je l'amène à la garderie.
Allez mon p'tit pote, on y va.
Attends !
T'oublierais pas un truc ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on a au programme ?
Rien de transcendant : un filtre à CO2
en panne près de l'infirmerie,
une conduite d'eau rompue
à la coquerie... Ah si,
maintenant que la plupart des Vipers
sont revenus de cale sèche,
le Chef va jeter un œil
sur les servomoteurs du sas 12.
Tu veux bien signer ?
C'est tout ?
La flotte est calme.
Tu devrais t'accorder un break.
Je peux tenir le premier quart.
Je vais m'en tenir au planning.
C'est un jour comme les autres.
<i>Un jour comme les autres ?</i>
<i>Peut-être que c'est lui
que j'aurais dû épouser.</i>
<i>On se serait arraché les places.</i>
On a eu de bons moments.
Mais davantage de mauvais...
<i>Pourtant tu persistes
à me faire revenir,</i>
<i>ce jour entre tous,</i>
<i>année après année.</i>
Ce que je ne comprends pas, c'est...
pourquoi ?
Moi non plus.
Excusez-moi, Monsieur.
Posez ça sur la table... Soldat.
Jaffee, Monsieur.
Autre chose pour votre service, Amiral ?
Ça sera tout, Jaffee.
<i>La journée va être longue.</i>
<i>Elle l'est à chaque fois.</i>
Bonjour, Chef.
- Nicky va bien ?
- Oui.
C'est la première fois
qu'il ne pleure pas quand je le dépose.
Alors, Figurski, tu vas au moins
faire semblant de bosser aujourd'hui ?
Putain de filtre !
Il faut 2 secondes à Adama
pour signer un ordre,
qu'on va mettre la journée à exécuter.
Ça te prendra la journée,
de toute façon.
Seelix, Cally, suivez-moi au sas 12.
- Seelix, tu t'occupes de la porte ?
- Ouais.
C'est le foutoir, ici.
Les Cylons ont semé une belle pagaille.
Personne n'est venu depuis le colmatage
des brèches par le Contrôle des dégâts.
- Seelix, tu m'entends ?
- Ouais.
<i>Tu veux bien regarder si tu trouves
le schéma électrique du sas ?</i>
OK.
Je viens de trouver
un déjeuner vieux d'un an.
Il a même pas pleuré ?
Cal, je te l'ai dit. Nicky va bien.
Ouais, et n'importe qui aurait pu
porter tes outils, ici.
- C'était pas obligé d'être moi.
- Il en fallait bien un.
Et tu connais ces mécanismes
mieux que personne.
Tu voudrais quoi ? Un traitement
de faveur parce que t'es ma femme ?
- Ça aurait l'air de quoi ?
- Je m'en fous !
On fait comme si rien n'avait changé.
Comme si notre vie était la même,
qu'avant New Caprica.
Mais c'est différent.
On est mariés.
On a un fils.
C'est juste un mauvais moment à passer.
<i>Et si les mauvais moments,
c'est tout ce qu'il nous reste ?</i>
On s'est juré d'élever Nicky nous-mêmes,
tu te rappelles ?
On s'est juré un paquet de trucs.
<i>Les Cylons ont pas vraiment aidé, hein ?
Passe-moi ces pinces coupantes.</i>
Qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
Oh, putain...
Seelix, qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Ouvre la porte.
Je n'ai rien fait.
Chef, je relève
un différentiel de pression, ici.
Mais, rien de méchant.
Mais vous perdez clairement de l'air.
Il suffit de pas grand chose.
Dès que les capteurs détectent
une fuite importante, toutes les portes
se ferment automatiquement.
C'est juste une mesure de sécurité.
- Je me sens en sécurité du coup.
<i>- Attendez un peu...</i>
<i>Vous dites
qu'il y a une brèche dans la coque ?</i>
Brèche est un peu exagéré,
mais de l'air s'échappe effectivement.
Une de ces rustines a dû craquer
quand on est rentrés.
Dès qu'on aura colmaté
et restauré la pression,
la porte devrait s'ouvrir.
Et on pourra retrouver ceux
qui ont fait cette putain de soudure
et leur botter le cul.
Le plus important c'est
qu'on puisse respirer.
Commençons par trouver la fuite.
C'est ici, c'est celle-là.

{\pos(192,230)}Leeson prend le premier quart.
Kinsey vérifie le registre.
{\pos(192,230)}Jaffee
{\pos(192,230)}me sert le café.
Jaffee me sert le café.
Tu fais toujours ça ?
Ces exercices de mémoire ?
Crois-tu qu'ils s'attendent à ce que
tu connaisses tous leurs noms ?
Tu ne changeras jamais, hein ?
Un des plaisirs d'être
morte depuis longtemps.
J'imagine.
Dépêche-toi, maintenant.
Tu vas être en retard pour voir Laura.
Elle a peut-être
un faible pour les bad boys.
Elle ne serait pas la première.
C'est la Présidente des Douze Colonies.
Bien sûr, où avais-je la tête...
Puisque tu t'es créé une image de dieu,
pourquoi ne pas la déifier, elle aussi ?
{\pos(192,230)}C'est encore une excuse
pour garder tes distances.
{\pos(192,230)}Amiral.
{\pos(192,230)}Madame la Présidente.
{\pos(192,230)}- Comment allez-vous ?
- Très bien.
{\pos(192,210)}Je suis désolée. Je suis sûre qu'on
aurait pu régler ça à distance.
{\pos(192,210)}Mais franchement, je devenais folle sur
le Colonial One, et je devais en sortir.
{\pos(192,210)}Les pilotes interstellaires
appelaient ça D.P.E.
{\pos(192,210)}- Qu'est ce que D.P.E. ?
- Dépassé Par les Événements.
Et vous serez toujours la bienvenue.
Vous le savez.
{\pos(192,210)}Vous changerez sûrement d'avis après ça.
Tory a préparé un programme.
Encore Baltar.
{\pos(192,210)}On pourrait pas simplement
le rendre aux Cylons ?
{\pos(192,210)}Vous savez à quel point j'aime
cette idée, malheureusement,
{\pos(192,210)}vu le peu de choses
que j'ai pu tirer de Caprica Six,
{\pos(192,210)}Je ne pense pas que les Cylons
le reprendraient.
- Nous sommes coincés.
- Bien.
Alors jugeons ce fils de pute
et qu'on en finisse.
Nous devons le juger,
mais sous quelle législation ?
Capricane ? Picone ? Taurienne ?
Doit-on le faire passer devant un jury ?
Ou bien une cour ?
{\pos(192,210)}Nous n'avons rien qui se rapproche
d'un corpus juridique complet
{\pos(192,210)}et cette flotte ne regorge pas vraiment
de juristes talentueux.
{\pos(192,210)}Si on implique des juristes, ils feront
traîner l'affaire pendant des mois.
Votre père n'était pas
avocat sur Caprica ?
{\pos(192,210)}Oui. Je vous ai dit que je ne
m'entendais pas très bien avec lui.
{\pos(192,210)}D'accord.
Je suis prête à installer
une commission d'organisation.
Mais franchement,
{\pos(192,210)}faire travailler ensemble
une pièce remplie de juristes
{\pos(192,210)}c'est une gageure. Donc,
{\pos(192,210)}je dois nommer un président
capable de faire des choix difficiles
{\pos(192,210)}et qui ne se laisse ni séduire,
ni impressionner par des avocaillons.
{\pos(192,210)}- Vous avez un nom ?
- En fait, oui. Je pensais à Lee.
{\pos(192,210)}Tel grand-père, tel petit-fils,
peut-être. Qu'en dites-vous ?
Je ne dis pas qu'il est
incapable de le gérer, mais
il n'a jamais manifesté
le moindre intérêt pour le droit.
Je sais, mais voila,
les juristes peuvent analyser la loi,
mais nous avons besoin de gens
qui sachent discerner le bien du mal.
Comme Lee.
- Je lui parlerai.
- Bien.
Et, Amiral,
je me demandais,
si ça vous gênerait que je
reste sur votre vaisseau
pour la journée ?
Avec plaisir. J'en serais ravi.
C'est difficile à admettre, mais
je vais à la gym.
Méfiez-vous.
Les meilleurs jours, ça sent
comme dans une chaussure.
Cherche une autre rustine. Je voudrais
doubler celle-ci pour que ça tienne.
Allez, Cal. Plus vite on fait ça,
plus vite on sortira.
J'ai entendu la 1ère fois.
<i>Tu deviens doué pour ignorer tout ça.</i>
<i>Ce silence soudain, ces regards en coin.</i>
<i>Je m'étais vraiment habituée à toi.</i>
Je ne me souviens pas
d'avoir jamais réussi à t'intimider.
C'est vrai.
Mais je te connaissais bien
avant que tu ne sois l'Amiral.
Du temps où tu étais juste Bill.
Le mari toujours absent.
Le père qui est parti.
Juste Bill.
Qui est Bill Adama, après tout ?
Ça reste une bonne question.
<i>Je me demande
si j'aurai la réponse.</i>
49 jours sans contact.
On a peut-être fait fuir
les toasteurs, finalement.
Ouais Narcho, ton style de vol merdique
leur colle une trouille du diable.
Comment ça va, mon pote ?
Qu'est-ce que t'as ?
Désolé, j'ai une drôle d'irritation.
Ah ouais ?
J'espère
qu'elle en valait la peine, mec.
Garde-à-vous !
Repos.
Avant de commencer,
un sondage à main levée.
Qui sait compter,
dans cette bande d'abrutis ?
Parce que j'entends pas mal
de chiffres, autour du hangar de pont.
47,
puis 48, et maintenant 49 jours depuis
notre dernier contact avec l'ennemi.
J'imagine que des calculs plus complexes
dépasseraient la plupart d'entre vous.
Je vais donc simplifier pour vous.
Un...
est le seul nombre
que vous devez retenir.
Parce que c'est juste ce qu'il faut
à un pilote pour baisser sa garde,
à un ECO pour rater un contact dradis,
et d'un coup les Cylons sont sur nous.
C'est comme ça que des gens meurent.
<i>Il est comme nous.</i>
Fier, têtu et furieux.
<i>Mais il commence à s'imposer,</i>
<i>surtout ces derniers mois.</i>
<i>Ce n'est pas à moi qu'il faut le dire.</i>
- C'est à lui.
- Il le sait.
Il sait quoi ?
Que l'Amiral va faire
un bon rapport d'évaluation sur lui ?
<i>Ou que son père l'aime ?</i>
Ne me dis pas que tu joues aussi
de ton masque d'Amiral avec Lee ?
Vols en formation,
correction de tir, tactiques,
<i>Touch-and-go</i> jusqu'à ce que
tout le monde le réussisse trois fois.
Les sections Rouge et Bleue
commenceront.
Les Jaune et Verte suivront.
Décollage dans dix minutes. Rompez !
Starbuck, si t'as un problème,
je veux pas le savoir.
Mon seul problème, c'est que t'aies pas
fait ce sermon il y a une semaine.
Il va falloir trouver
de nouvelles tirades.
Le Patron utilise le coup de
"l'erreur fatale", depuis qu'on est ici.
Quitte à copier,
autant copier le meilleur.
Monsieur.
T'as été assez dur, aujourd'hui.
Un coup de pied au cul
vaut mieux qu'un long discours.
Les Dieux savent combien
tu m'en as donné.
Tout va bien ?
Ç'était une sacré matinée.
La Présidente souhaite expédier
le procès de Baltar.
Elle cherche quelqu'un
pour se charger des préparatifs
et bricoler le cadre légal.
Elle veut que je te transfère.
C'est une blague.
Intéressé ?
Surpris, plutôt.
Elle t'a dit pourquoi moi ?
Elle va avoir besoin
de quelqu'un de confiance.
C'est tout à fait toi.
Je me rappelle quand tu étais jeune,
que tu allais chez ton grand-père,
et tu étais fasciné par ses articles
et ses livres de Droit.
Et moi qui pensais être discret,
en m'eclipsant,
tout seul dans son bureau.
C'est un rêve lointain, maintenant.
Mais à l'époque, pendant un instant,
j'ai vraiment pensé à "Avocat"
comme une des carrières que j'aurais
pu avoir avant de rejoindre l'armée.
Je ne l'ai jamais su.
C'était certainement
pendant une de mes...
phases "fâché contre papa".
De toute façon, c'est impossible.
Même si je voulais aider,
c'est impossible.
Le CAG est de service, 24 heures sur 24,
7 jours sur 7, même une semaine creuse.
C'est bien ce que je pensais.
Major, on attend plus que vous.
Excuse-moi.
Ok, quelqu'un doit le faire.
Seelix, vérifie la pression.
Si la rustine tient le coup,
ça s'équilibrera en quelques
minutes et la porte va s'ouvrir.
- Putain de merde.
- Par les Dieux.
- Comment vont-ils ?
- Toujours en vie.
<i>Ceci est une alerte de niveau 3.
Brèche de la coque au pont 14.</i>
Chef !
Amiral...
On dirait bien
que c'est vraiment la merde.
Vous nous rendriez un sacré service
en ouvrant ces portes.
Il faut les sortir de là.
Continue de bouger.
La sas est conçu pour se verrouiller
si la pression descend subitement.
- Dès que...
- Je connais le système.
On a des systèmes redondants,
des renforts.
La commande manuelle est H.S.
Il n'y a aucun moyen d'ouvrir
les portes intérieures.
Le système a dû subir de gros dégâts
lors de la fuite de New Caprica.
Tout le vaisseau a été pilonné.
Il faudrait six semaines en cale sèche,
rien que pour réparer la tôle,
sans parler des dommages structurels.
- Combien de temps ont-ils ?
- Avec une fuite de cette taille,
ils n'auront plus d'air
dans 30 minutes, au mieux.
Ce sont des portes anti-explosion.
Ça prendrait au moins
une heure pour les perforer.
Et si on faisait exploser la vitre de
la cabine pour les faire sortir de là ?
Non, elle résisterait
à une explosion de Tylium.
Tout ce qui pourrait détruire la vitre
emporterait
Tyrol et Cally en même temps.
Il me faut un plan de sauvetage.
Pas des excuses.
Sept secondes.
Et dix de plus pour
repressuriser en plein espace.
C'est limite.
C'est peut-être une question bête...
Quelqu'un a déjà tenté
un sauvetage comme ça ?
Personne n'est taré à ce point.
Aucune importance.
On n'a plus de temps. Prépare-toi.
- On n'a plus que 18 minutes.
- Allez, à nous de jouer.
Galen.
<i>Le sas est toujours bloqué, Chef.</i>
<i>Ça ne répond pas en manuel.</i>
On dirait qu'on a épuisé
toutes nos options.
<i>Je vais vous faire sortir
par la porte avant.</i>
Vous allez placer un vaisseau,
et monter un pont de transbordage ?
<i>Vous allez manquer d'air
d'ici quelques minutes.</i>
<i>Pas de temps pour un pont.</i>
<i>Si c'est une sortie dans l'espace,
vous oubliez nos combinaisons.</i>
Nous n'avons pas le choix.
<i>Athena va placer son Raptor
en face de la porte, sas ouvert.</i>
On fera sauter les boulons de la porte
et quand elle s'ouvrira,
vous devrez sauter.
Écoutez-moi bien, tous les deux.
<i>Vous pouvez le faire.</i>
<i>On peut survivre jusqu'à une minute
dans le vide, sans combinaison.</i>
Amiral, je ne sais pas.
<i>On parlera plus tard.</i>
<i>Préparez-vous.</i>
<i>Athena, ici le Galactica.
Vous avez la priorité de passage.</i>
<i>Le reste du trafic a été détourné.</i>
Attends.
- Et Nicky ?
- L'amiral a raison.
On doit se préparer.
On doit tout déplacer,
de là jusqu'à la porte.
Galen...
On sait tous les deux ce qui arrive
aux enfants orphelins dans la flotte.
<i>Apollo et Dee.</i>
<i>Ils s'en occuperont.</i>
<i>Non.</i>
<i>Pas des pilotes.</i>
<i>Il ne subira pas ça
une seconde fois.</i>
Monsieur ?
Il y a une famille de civils.
<i>La mère s'appelle Susan Deckler.</i>
Elle a une petite fille.
<i>Si quelque chose nous arrivait...</i>
<i>Je m'en occuperais.</i>
J'ai été égoïste.
Je te voulais avec moi.
Comme au bon vieux temps.
Je n'ai pas réfléchi à Nick.
<i>Je suis désolé.</i>
L'amiral va nous sortir de là, compris ?
Et tu t'occuperas de Nicky.
Ils auront de graves problèmes
s'ils restent dehors
plus de quelques secondes.
Mal de décompression,
au mieux l'hypothermie.
Ils peuvent mourir gelés.
Assure-toi que Cottle tienne
son caisson hyperbare prêt.
<i>Je suis désolée.</i>
<i>Galactica, ici Apollo.
On met le Raptor en position,</i>
<i>par le travers du sas 12.</i>
Mets ton masque.
<i>Bon, écoutez-moi.</i>
<i>On n'a pas le temps de rester loin
jusqu'à l'explosion de la porte,</i>
<i>donc on pourra subir des turbulences
à cause de l'oxygène résiduel</i>
<i>et même de se prendre des éclats.
Athena.</i>
- Tiens-toi prête à compenser.
- Pas de souci, Major.
On se maintiendra jusqu'à ce
que le Chef et Cally soient en sûreté.
Finissons-en.
<i>Galactica, ici Apollo.
La porte du Raptor est ouverte.</i>
<i>On attend.</i>
<i>- Parés à commencer.</i>
- Chef, Cally.
<i>Le Raptor est en position.
On doit y aller.</i>
Faites sauter la porte. À mon signal.
Bon.
Quoi qu'il arrive...
Tu t'accroches à moi.
Ne lâche pas.
Compris ?
Trois.
<i>Deux.</i>
Un.
Maintenant !
<i>Attention !
Vire à droite ! À droite !</i>
<i>En position !</i>
<i>- Lève ton nez ! Lève-le !
- Compris !</i>
<i>Reste comme ça !</i>
<i>Galactica, ici Apollo.</i>
<i>Raptor sécurisé et pressurisé.
Ils sont mal en point.</i>
<i>On les emmène
tout de suite à l'infirmerie.</i>
Entre.
Des nouvelles du Chef et de Cally ?
Ils sont en vie.
Mais ils sont toujours en observation.
Tu vas me dire ce qui ne va pas ?
C'est cette journée...
Par les Dieux,
ton anniversaire de mariage.
J'avais complètement oublié.
Ça doit paraître idiot.
Surtout vu comment
ça s'est terminé, mais...
N'empêche.
Ça représente toujours
quelque chose pour moi.
On n'en a jamais parlé.
Du divorce.
De ta mère...
C'était dur pour nous tous.
Ta mère vous a donné à toi...
et à ton frère, un foyer.
De la stabilité.
Papa, je sais
que tu veux croire ça, mais...
Tu sais quoi, laisse tomber.
C'était il y a longtemps.
Si tu as quelque chose
à dire, fils, dis-le.
On avait bien quatre murs.
Mais de la stabilité ?
Par les Dieux, tu connaissais Maman.
Ses sautes d'humeurs.
- C'est pour ça que tu l'as quittée.
- On avait nos problèmes, mais...
Elle vous aimait profondément,
ton frère et toi.
Les choses ont changé
après ton départ.
Parfois, il lui arrivait
de perdre pied.
<i>Ne l'écoute pas, Bill.</i>
Alors elle se mettait à s'excuser.
Elle promettait qu'elle
améliorerait les choses.
Et puis elle se remettait à boire,
et toutes ses bonnes intentions
passaient directement par la fenêtre.
<i>C'est vrai ?</i>
Je ne peux pas croire
que tu me demandes ça.
Merde.
<i>C'est vrai ?</i>
Et un jour,
elle a même arrêté de s'excuser.
Ça suffit.
<i>Tu m'as abandonnée !</i>
Tu m'as abandonnée !
Le grand Commandant !
<i>Qui pouvait mener
tous ses hommes au combat</i>
<i>mais n'arrivait
pas à vivre avec sa propre famille !</i>
<i>On n'a jamais habité
au même endroit plus de six mois.</i>
<i>On te suivait
d'une base à une autre.</i>
En attendant que tu rentres à la maison.
Mais tu n'étais là
pour aucun d'entre nous !
Il fallait toujours
faciliter la vie du grand Adama !
Ils avaient besoin de toi.
Ils étaient nos enfants.
Ils avaient besoin d'un père.
<i>Tout au long de ta brillante carrière,</i>
<i>tu t'es enorgueilli
d'être un meneur d'hommes,</i>
<i>de juger les gens.</i>
De toujours
prendre les décisions difficiles.
Mais quand il a fallu prendre
la plus grande décision de ta vie...
Bill, tu as tout foiré.
On n'a jamais été fait l'un pour l'autre
mais tu ne pouvais l'accepter.
<i>Voilà, c'est pour ça
que tu continues à te rappeler</i>
<i>Car si tu avais fait</i>
<i>cette erreur...</i>
<i>ça remettrait en cause</i>
<i>toutes tes autres décisions.</i>
Elle était quand même ta mère, Lee.
Je l'aimais.
Je te crois.
Mais je doute
qu'elle t'ait jamais aimé.
Il est juste là.
Je suis passée à la garderie.
Quelqu'un voulait te voir.
- Mais qui voilà ?
- Salut, petit bonhomme.
Comment va-t-elle ?
Cottle dit qu'elle va s'en tirer,
mais il faudra du temps
pour qu'elle soit complètement rétablie.
Attention.
OK ?
Oui, ça va.
Je sais.
Viens là.
Je te tiens.
Viens voir papa.
Petit bonhomme.
Tu veux aller voir maman ?
Voir ta maman.
On va aller voir maman. Allez.
Elle est par là...
Cal.
Cal.
Chérie.
Regarde qui est là.
<i>Regarde qui est là.</i>
Seelix.
Je ne sais pas comment,
mais quoi qu'il arrive,
on trouvera...
on trouvera un équilibre, toi et moi.
On s'occupera de Nick,
d'accord ?
Je t'aime.
Regarde, c'est la main de maman.
Voilà.
Comment ça va ?
Bien.
- C'est quoi, ça ?
- C'était là quand je suis entrée.
Ça vient de ton père.
Ça fait tic-tac ?
Il t'a laissé un mot.
"Code pénal de Caprica".
<i>PROPRIÉTÉ DE JOSEPH ADAMA</i>
Ce sont les livres de Droit
de mon grand-père.
Ton père les avait sûrement
tous conservés.
Pourquoi te les donne-t-il maintenant ?
"Pour le jour
où nous aurons tous le temps."
<i>Contente que vous soyez venu.
J'ai quelque chose pour vous.</i>
Ça m'a été donné
par un des colons sur New Caprica.
Je l'avais oublié mais Tory l'a retrouvé
dans une pile de vieux habits.
"Le sang coule à minuit".
Ne faites pas attention au titre,
c'est un bon roman à énigmes.
Je pense que vous l'apprécierez.
Ce n'est pas un prêt.
C'est un cadeau.
Pensez-vous parfois
aux instants sur New Caprica ?
J'essaie
de penser aux bons moments, oui.
Un souvenir en particulier
me revient à l'esprit.
Vous portiez votre robe rouge vif.
Vous disiez
vouloir construire une cabane.
C'était à la cérémonie
de fondation de Baltar.
J'ai été un peu ridicule cette nuit là.
Vous demandez-vous ce qui serait arrivé
si les Cylons n'étaient pas revenus ?
Entre Baltar et le terrain, je crois
qu'on n'en aurait rien tiré.
Et vous ?
Vous seriez resté sur le Galactica,
ou bien vous vous seriez installé ?
C'est assez hypothétique, n'est-ce pas ?
Effectivement.
Jusqu'à ce que ce ne soit plus le cas.
Je viens de dire ça ?
Ça vaut la peine
de vous voir rire ainsi.
La guerre dure depuis si longtemps
qu'on en oublie pour quoi on se bat.
Élever nos enfants en paix.
Apprécier la présence de l'autre.
Profiter de la vie
comme des gens normaux
Comme cette nuit sur New Caprica.
C'est vraiment de ça
qu'il s'agit en ce moment,
n'est-ce pas ?
De ça et...
... d'autres moments.
Donc si les Cylons
n'étaient pas revenus ?
Mais ils sont revenus.
Nous avons des responsabilités.
Oui, en effet, Monsieur. Et...
je reviendrai dans quelques jours.
Si vous voulez, on pourra...
... parler davantage de cette nuit-là.
Bill ?
La réponse est oui.
J'aurais vraiment construit la cabane.
<i>Vas-y.</i>
<i>Range-la, comme
après chaque anniversaire.</i>
Promets-moi que tu ne la sortiras plus.
Il me serait plus facile de te haïr.
Mais ça serait un mensonge, Carolanne.
Et on a eu suffisamment
de ça dans notre vie.
Il y avait
quelque chose entre nous, non ?
Oui.
Il y avait quelque chose.
À l'année prochaine.
- =( Team Lords of Kobol )= -
LES CYLONS FURENT CRÉÉS PAR L'HOMME
ILS SE RÉVOLTÈRENT
ILS ÉVOLUÈRENT
IL Y A DE NOMBREUSES COPIES
ET ILS ONT UN PLAN
Précédemment dans
<i>Battlestar Galactica</i>
Je réclame le droit,
en tant que citoyen des Colonies,
à un avocat
et à une procédure ordinaire.
- Ah oui ?
- Alors, que va-t-il se passer ?
On lui accorde son procès.
Mon père était un prêtre
et ma mère, un Oracle.
Je sers sur des Battlestars
depuis que j'ai 18 ans.
Quand vous m'avez élu
président du syndicat,
j'avais promis de protéger nos emplois,
vous devez vous jeter sur
les rouages et sur les leviers
et sur la machine
elle-même et l'arrêter.
Grève ! Grève !
Tu fais comme si rien n'avait changé.
Comme si notre vie était la même,
qu'avant New Caprica.
Mais c'est différent.
C'est juste un mauvais moment à passer.
Et si les mauvais moments,
c'est tout ce qu'il nous reste ?
Figurski, Pollux, Sanchez,
vous devez réparer des moteurs
alors ne prévoyez rien pour ce soir.
Maintiens le bouton
de contrôle SOL sur SEC.
Je croyais qu'on refilait l'entretien
des mulets aux civils de Clebsville.
J'avais pas assez de mécanos, là-bas.
- Vérifie le débit.
- Débit stable à deux-neuf-zéro.
On se repose quand, Chef ?
J'enchaîne les astreintes
depuis 15 jours.
Je sais, je sais.
En plus, ça siffle
encore dans mes oreilles.
J'entends rien.
Désolé. Je t'entends pas.
Ça siffle. C'est quoi ça ?
Très drôle, les gars.
- Les voyants FUS sont nases.
- Mets le réservoir en mode "Fuel".
Alimentation coupée.
Très bien, réservoir coupé.
C'est bon. Arrête la pompe à carburant.
Enlève le tube. Lt, le plein est fait.
Vous pouvez décoller.
Compris, Chef. Parée à décoller.
Appel pour le linge.
Figurski, Pollux,
Redford, prenez votre bazar.
Avant que je le foute au rebut.
- T'as plié mes slips comme j'aime ?
- Va chier.
Quel langage. Tu crois qu'on
laisse les officiers parler comme ça ?
Va falloir changer de manières
quand t'auras tes ailes.
Je serai pas pilote.
Ils ont rejeté ma demande de formation.
Mais t'as cartonné à l'écrit.
L'entretien s'est bien passé ?
Et bien, il apparaît que
j'occupe un poste "crucial"
et que ma mutation causerait
de "graves dysfonctionnements".
- Ça craint.
- "Poste crucial", mon cul.
Ils veulent pas d'une petite main
en salle de briefing.
OK, ça suffit. La ferme. Ça suffit.
Le CAG m'a dit qu'on t'a
refusé la formation au vol.
J'en suis désolé. Ça craint.
On a besoin de toi ici. T'es
notre meilleur spécialiste en avionique.
Et elle sait plier les slips.
Assez ! Assez ! Lâche-le.
La ferme, Figurski !
Ou je t'en colle une moi-même.
Maintenant, retourne bosser.
- Viens par ici.
- Lâche-moi.
Écoute-moi.
Écoute...
Tu fais un boulot important ici.
Aussi important que celui d'un pilote.
Merci, Chef.
Je vais distribuer du linge "important".
Raptor en vol.
Relevés normaux.
<i>Tout à l'air OK.</i>
Je règle le cap au deux-neuf-six-cinq...
Putain, c'est quoi ?
Moteur éteint ! Tuyère du SCR bloquée.
Redémarrage.
Négatif.
<i>Galactica, ici Skulls.
Le moteur 2 est bloqué à fond.</i>
<i>Le moteur 1 ne redémarre pas.</i>
Le moteur 2 est en feu.
Ça va exploser. Ramène-toi ici.
Éjection ! Éjection !

On a eu de la chance :
une douzaine de blessés,
{\pos(192,230)}- aucun mort.
- Merci.
Vous auriez vu l'épaule de Tory.
J'ai dû aider Cottle
à la remettre en place.
{\pos(192,230)}Je suis si occupée
que je ne viens jamais ici.
{\pos(192,210)}Et je vais devoir vivre ici
pour Dieu sait combien de temps,
jusqu'à la fin des réparations.
Si vos quartiers deviennent exigus,
vous êtes toujours la bienvenue
dans un de mes lits.
Façon de parler.
{\pos(192,210)}Du nouveau sur
l'incident de votre Raptor ?
{\pos(192,210)}On poursuit l'enquête,
{\pos(192,210)}mais il semble que le tylium était
{\pos(192,210)}abondamment contaminé par des impuretés.
Vraisemblablement,
un problème avec le raffinage.
{\pos(192,185)}Que se passe-t-il ? La raffinerie
était la plus fiable de la flotte.
{\pos(192,210)}Maintenant, j'ai tous
les jours une pile de messages
{\pos(192,210)}de leur chef... Quel est son nom ?
- Xeno Fenner.
- Fenner...
Il se plaint des conditions de travail,
{\pos(192,210)}des livraisons,
{\pos(192,210)}des pièces détachées, des émoluments.
{\pos(192,210)}Voyez-vous ça !
On court pour sauver nos vies,
{\pos(192,210)}et l'homme veut discuter des heures sup.
On a été plus que patients avec Fenner
et ses problèmes de production.
Deux semaines à attendre
qu'il remette de l'ordre...
Je ne sais pas pour vous,
mais je suis prêt à reprendre la route
pour trouver la Terre.
{\pos(192,210)}Dois-je y voir une lueur d'espoir ?
{\pos(192,210)}Le sceptique a-t-il enfin décidé que
nous étions en route pour la Terre ?
En ai-je jamais douté ?
{\pos(192,175)}Mes hommes font
des quarts de 18 heures depuis six mois.
Combien de temps ils pourront tenir ?
Si les Cylons se montrent,
on a assez de carburant
{\pos(192,210)}pour faire quoi... un saut ?
{\pos(192,210)}Peut-être deux.
C'est une faible marge à mon goût.
Et selon vous et vos hommes ?
Si vous avez un problème, résolvez-le.
Maintenez les vannes ouvertes,
et nous discuterons, je vous le promets.
"Nous discuterons".
C'est toujours "plus tard".
Vous savez,
c'est drôle,
car lorsque le carburant coule,
mes appels ne sont jamais entendus.
Mais à la seconde où il y a
un problème d'approvisionnement,
je me retrouve devant
la Présidente et l'Amiral.
Peut-être qu'on devrait avoir
plus de problèmes.
C'est une menace ?
Comme le dit le livre...
"Si tu entends le peuple,
tu ne craindras jamais le peuple."
Vous avez dit "le livre" ?
Gardes, arrêtez-le.
Pour extorsion
et entrave à un service prioritaire
en temps de guerre.
Allez, embarquez-le. Dehors. Ouste.
Suivez-moi, Monsieur.
- Qu'est-ce qui vient de se passer ?
- Il a cité le livre de Baltar.
Les divagations que son avocat
a fait sortir de sa cellule ?
Il l'a fait imprimer
et diffuser dans toute la flotte.
Il l'a intitulé : "Mes victoires,
mes erreurs" par Gaius Baltar.
Je commence à envisager
un bon vieil autodafé.
Comment est le hachis ?
C'est mon plat préféré.
C'est pas pour toi.
Rappelle-toi notre petite conversation !
Aujourd'hui,
c'est "journée sans régime".
Ça fait trois jours
que c'est "journée sans régime".
Vraiment ?
Tu marchais mieux, hier.
C'est l'effet du mal de décompression ?
Je suis juste énervée pour Seelix,
alors, je me crispe.
Ils auraient dû lui indiquer dès
le départ, les priorités de la flotte.
Lui dire que
la flotte a plus besoin
de matelots que de pilotes.
Ça n'a rien à voir
avec les priorités de la flotte.
On n'est pas de la classe dirigeante,
alors on se paye le sale boulot.
"La classe dirigeante",
d'où tu sors ça ?
Un truc que j'ai lu.
Par Baltar.
Son putain de torchon
a fait le tour de la flotte ?
J'arrive pas à croire
qu'on puisse lire ce qu'écrit ce type.
C'est ce que je pensais aussi, mais...
Tu t'es jamais demandé
pourquoi les pilotes
et les officiers
viennent des colonies riches, comme
Caprica, Virgon et Tauron,
alors que tous les matelots
viennent des colonies pauvres, comme
Aerelon, Sagittaron et Geminon ?
C'est des foutaises qu'on entend
sur le pont.
Ah ouais ?
Cite-moi un officier
qui vient d'une colonie pauvre ?
Dualla.
Le lieutenant Dualla est de Sagittaron.
Le parfait exemple.
Comment elle a été promue ?
En épousant un officier...
de Caprica.
Tyrol.
<i>Chef, le contremaître de la raffinerie
vient d'être arrêté.</i>
<i>Xeno Fenner ?</i>
- Vous le connaissez ?
- Un problème avec Xeno ?
Ils l'ont arrêté.
Oui, Monsieur, il faisait
partie du syndicat sur New Caprica.
Un type bien. Qu'est-ce qu'il a fait ?
Il a fait chier la Présidente.
Mais le vrai problème,
ce sont les opérations de raffinage.
<i>J'ai besoin de quelqu'un, là-bas,
pour faire redémarrer la production.</i>
Formez un groupe, équipez-vous,
et soyez prêts dans une heure.
Oui, Monsieur.
Je comprends pas.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe avec Xeno ?
Il a fait chier la Présidente.
On peut se faire arrêter pour ça,
maintenant ?
Je pense que l'Amiral plaisantait.
Ouais.
- Tu repenses jamais au syndicat ?
- Si, mais c'est de l'histoire ancienne.
New Caprica, c'est terminé, mais
les gars du syndicat sont toujours là.
La seule différence c'est qu'ils n'ont
plus personne pour les défendre.
Je dois y aller.
J'espère que vous vous amusez bien.
Ça ne vous suffit pas de me réveiller
et de souiller ma nourriture.
Il faut aussi que vous détruisiez
mes affaires. C'est pathétique.
Vous êtes totalement...
Bonjour, Docteur.
Pourquoi ne pas vous faciliter la vie ?
Donnez-nous les pages
et arrêtez ce cirque.
- Je ne sais pas de quoi vous parlez.
- Tournez-le.
Les pages de votre livre.
"Mes victoires, mes erreurs"
par Gaius Baltar.
Donc, vous l'avez lu.
Les gens le lisent et ça vous dérange.
On sait que votre avocat fait
sortir les pages depuis des semaines,
donc on les a interceptées.
Je crains d'être la seule à l'avoir lu
et je meurs d'envie de connaître la fin.
Qu'est-ce qui vous est passé
par la tête ?
Vous décrire comme un homme du peuple,
un fils de fermier.
Un révolutionnaire.
Voyons !
Ça va peut-être vous surprendre
Madame la Président,
mais j'espère bien toucher
la corde sensible du peuple.
Donnez-nous les pages
ou je vous fais fouiller par les gardes.
Décidez-vous.
Messieurs, allez-y.
Ne cède pas, Gaius.
Montre-lui qu'elle ne peut te briser.
Garde ta dignité.
Peut-être accepteriez-vous
de le préfacer ?
Merci, Docteur.
Fermez la cellule.
Ce n'est pas grave, Gaius.
Tout va bien se passer.
- Tyrol.
- Salut, Cabott.
Comment vas-tu ?
Content de te revoir.
- Désolé.
- C'est inévitable.
Écoute. Je voulais te dire,
on a tous été soulagés
quand on a appris qu'ils t'envoyaient.
- Ah, ouais ?
- Tu m'étonnes.
Je leur ai parlé de toi
et raconté comment le syndicat
- s'est battu pour les faibles.
- Ouais...
Voilà l'intégralité
des réserves de tylium de la flotte.
Ça représente combien de sauts ?
On aura de la chance
si on quitte ce système.
Fais-nous faire le tour du propriétaire,
qu'on fasse le point.
Sacré dispositif.
Et encore, tu devrais voir
quand on est à plein régime.
C'est aussi bruyant qu'une bombe A,
et à peu près aussi dangereux.
Écoute, on a vraiment
besoin de cette immobilisation.
J'veux dire, regarde autour de toi.
La prochaine fois que ça va merder,
c'est pas un Raptor qui va lâcher.
Ce vaisseau,
c'est une bombe qui demande qu'à péter.
Je comprends les risques, mais
j'ai besoin de la voir tourner, donc...
Active tes gars et
déclenche la mise à feu.
Ça marchera pas.
Tu bosses ici ?
C'est Milo. Mon meilleur mécano.
Milo, hein ?
Dis-moi, Milo,
pourquoi ça va pas marcher ?
Il y a un truc que vous m'avez pas dit ?
Allez.
OK.
J'imagine
que je vais devoir me faire mon idée.
C'est la soupape de sécurité ?
Il manque des joints.
Tous les joints.
Sans joints de pression,
ça ne fonctionnera pas.
- Où sont-ils ?
- Perdus, j'imagine...
Les mecs, vous pouvez
pas déconner avec ça.
- L'Amiral ne le tolérera pas.
- L'Amiral peut aller se faire foutre.
Allez, Chef. Tu sais ce qui est en jeu.
Si les conditions
de travail s'améliorent,
et que Xeno sort de prison,
on devrait pouvoir retrouver ces joints.
En attendant, ce vaisseau
ne raffinera pas une goutte de tylium.
Ce qui veut dire
que la flotte n'ira nulle part.
J'ai fait fouiller le bateau,
mais les joints sont introuvables.
Vous savez que c'est du sabotage.
J'ai bien envie de les enfermer.
Monsieur, je vous en prie.
Ils auraient pu me tendre un piège.
Ils auraient pu
contaminer le carburant et rendre
- tous les vaisseaux inutilisables
- Bons Dieux.
Ils n'ont fait que
gagner un peu de temps.
La machinerie a besoin d'une révision.
La défaillance
du contrôle de qualité s'explique.
Vous réalisez que la plupart
des ouvriers de ce vaisseau
n'ont pas eu un jour de congé depuis
la première attaque des Colonies ?
Ça ressemble à de l'esclavage.
Ne soyez pas ridicule.
L'équipage de ce vaisseau
est coincé ici.
Ils ne peuvent ni partir, ni être mutés.
Ils ne contrôlent pas leurs vies.
C'est dur, on le sait. Ils s'imaginent
que c'est une partie de plaisir
à l'usine de munitions, au traitement
des algues ou à la déchetterie ?
Les vaisseaux de la flotte
sont remplis de gens
qui travaillent dans des conditions
atroces et personne ne s'amuse.
Eh bien, si on libérait au moins Xeno
et qu'on évoquait l'amélioration
des conditions de vie et de travail,
les protestations cesseraient.
Ils rendraient les joints de pression,
et on règlerait
le problème du carburant.
L'extorsion n'est pas
une méthode acceptable.
Qui sont les leaders ?
- Juste Cabbott.
- Je vais lancer un mandat d'arrêt.
Mettez-le aux fers.
Faites-le tout déballer.
Amiral, Madame la Présidente,
- ils essaient seulement de...
- Chef, non. C'est tout.
Je vais voir Cabott et Xeno.
Chef ?
Vous devez le sortir de là.
Qu'est-ce qu'il a aux mains, bordel ?
Je me suis réveillé dans la nuit,
il grattait les murs.
Il a gratté
jusqu'à ce que ses doigts saignent.
Ils diront que ça n'a pas d'importance.
Il était en prison sur New Caprica,
vous vous souvenez ?
Il en est sorti fêlé
et ça n'arrange rien.
Allez, vous devez le sortir de là.
Où sont les joints ?
- Espèce de fils de pute.
- Allez.
Allez Galen !
Vous devez le sortir de là !
Cabott !
Cabott, regarde-moi !
Cabott, écoute-moi. Où sont les joints ?
Je sais pas. Ça n'a pas d'importance.
Cabott, je peux te faire sortir.
Dis-moi où sont les joints.
Ça n'a pas d'importance !
Par les Dieux, faites-le sortir !
Où sont les joints ?
- Où sont-ils ?
- Ça n'a pas d'importance !
Regarde-le ! Où sont les joints ?
- Où ils sont ?
- La ventilation !
OK ? Ils sont dans la ventilation
de la poupe centrale !
- Dites à la Présidente de les relâcher.
- Merde !
OK, c'est le dernier.
On va remettre ça en marche
et retourner au travail.
Oui, Monsieur.
Tout ce que vous voulez, "patron".
Je peux actionner l'interrupteur ?
- Quel âge tu as ?
- 12 ans.
Bientôt.
Mais je peux faire tourner
toutes nos machines.
Le seul truc que j'ai jamais fait
c'est mettre tout en route.
Vas-y.
Il y a des gosses, là-bas,
Madame la Présidente.
Il y a des enfants sur tous
des vaisseaux de la flotte.
Ces enfants travaillent
dans une raffinerie.
Ils ont 12, 15 ans.
Il y a des familles à bord de la
raffinerie depuis le début,
et d'autres y sont arrivées
après l'attaque des Colonies.
Ces deux dernières années,
les parents ont appris aux enfants
le fonctionnement de la machinerie.
Ils ont transmis leur savoir-faire.
C'est tout à fait normal.
Ce n'est pas l'idéal, je le sais.
Mais rien n'est idéal dans cette flotte.
Vous voyez ce qui se passe ?
Les métiers deviennent héréditaires,
Madame la Présidente.
Combien de temps on va rester
sur ces vaisseaux ? Et si c'est 10 ans ?
J'apprends à mon fils à être mécano,
parce que j'en suis un,
et c'est tout ce qu'il
pourra jamais être ?
C'est ça, l'avenir qu'on veut ?
Vous marquez un point.
Tory, vous allez recenser
les gens qui ont
une expérience professionnelle
adaptée à la raffinerie :
ouvriers, mécanos,
tout ce qui vous vient à l'esprit.
Donnez-la au Chef.
Et vous, organisez un tirage au sort.
Nous prendrons des gens
d'autres vaisseaux,
pour former des équipes
à la raffinerie. Ça vous va, Chef ?
- Merci.
- Merci à vous.
Voilà notre arrivage de Clebsville.
Mettez-les dans ces vaisseaux
avant qu'ils sachent où ils vont.
- OK, tout le monde, on y va !
- Excusez-moi, Monsieur ?
Salut.
Je ne sais pas à qui m'adresser,
mais je ne pense pas correspondre
à ce que vous recherchez.
J'ai pas vraiment les compétences.
- Ton nom ?
- Danny Noon.
Figurski. Noon ?
Noon.
- "Noon, Daniel". Tu étais fermier.
- Fermier, c'est ce qu'on cherche,
- des gens habitués aux machines.
- Non, pas moi. Pas vraiment. Je...
J'ai travaillé un été dans une ferme,
pour payer mes études d'architecture.
Mais les Cylons ont attaqué, et...
maintenant, je suis fermier ?
Vous trouvez ça juste ?
Comment ça peut être juste ?
Excuse-moi une minute.
Si on fait une exception,
il y en aura 15 autres après lui.
Regarde-le, c'est un gosse.
OK, mets-le dans le vaisseau.
Écoute, c'est temporaire, OK ?
Attendez. Une seconde.
Je suis pas fermier.
- C'est temporaire.
- Non, attendez.
- Vous pouvez pas vérifier mon dossier ?
- Ouais.
Excusez-moi. À qui je dois m'adresser ?
À qui je dois m'adresser ?
Vous ne comprenez pas.
Je suis pas fermier !
Arrêtez ! Je suis pas fermier !
Que faites-vous ici ?
Votre livre...
Réalité ou fiction ?
Vous l'avez donc lu.
Voilà qui prouve que la Présidente
est une menteuse accomplie.
Elle m'a dit qu'il n'était pas sorti.
Qu'en avez-vous pensé ?
J'en pense que
c'est un tas de conneries.
De toute évidence, ma description d'une
société à deux vitesses vous effraie.
Mais tout ce qui est
dans mon livre est vrai.
Tout est vrai ?
C'est vrai que vous êtes
un garçon de ferme d'Aerelon ?
C'est tout à fait vrai.
J'ai grandi dans une fermière laitière
près de Cuffle's Breath Wash
sur Aerelon.
Pourquoi j'ai un mal fou à vous imaginer
en train de traire des vaches
et de charrier de la merde.
Le manque d'imagination.
Ou votre petite histoire
est de la merde.
J'ai connu des gens d'Aerelon. Vous...
- n'avez pas du tout leur accent.
- Je n'ai pas l'accent d'Aerelon ?
- Non.
- Je prends ça comme un compliment.
Je sais pas pour vous, mais
j'ai toujours trouvé l'accent d'Aerelon
particulièrement disgracieux à entendre.
Sans doute les consonnes
qui vous raclent le fond de la gorge.
Je suis un expert
sur mon accent maternel.
J'ai passé des heures à le supprimer.
Vous savez à quel point c'est dur
pour un garçon de 10 ans
de changer sa façon de parler.
De désapprendre tout ce qu'il a appris,
pour qu'un jour...
Un jour, il ait une infime chance
de ne pas être considéré
comme originaire d'Aerelon.
Je sais pas... de Caprica.
Caprican.
Être Caprican.
Siège du pouvoir, lieu de culture,
d'art, de science, d'éducation.
Qu'était Aerelon ? Juste un rocher
gris et moche, condamné à être
le grenier des 12 mondes.
Et on était traités comme tels.
Comme des domestiques,
des ouvriers, des prolétaires.
Vous auriez été
à votre place là-bas, Chef.
Des tas d'hommes qui
aiment le travail manuel, et
chopent une pinte au pub,
avant de finir la soirée
par une bonne vieille bagarre.
Oh, oui.
J'ai quitté Aerelon
après mon 18ème anniversaire.
J'ai tourné le dos à ma famille.
À mon patrimoine.
À tout cela.
Bien sûr tout ça n'a plus d'importance.
Ils sont tous morts maintenant.
Vous réalisez que
ça n'a plus cours ici.
C'est monsieur le mécanicien qui dit ça.
Nous avons conservé une démocratie.
Nous avons un gouvernement,
des droits, des élections...
Donc vous devez vous sentir
parfaitement heureux.
Parfaitement serein.
Rentrez chez vous.
Laissez-moi tranquille.
Après tout,
c'est ce que veut l'aristocratie.
Elle veut que
les travailleurs se sentent protégés
alors qu'ils récoltent des miettes
à la table des maîtres.
Je pose une question à la fin du livre.
Je vous en épargne la lecture.
Croyez-vous honnêtement que la flotte
sera un jour commandée par quelqu'un
dont le patronyme n'est pas Adama ?
Voilà, Chef.
Certaines règles pour l'aristocratie,
et d'autres règles pour nous autres.
On a assigné leurs tâches aux nouveaux
qui viennent du tirage au sort.
Tu les a mis direct au boulot.
Oui, oui, ça va. Ils sont
un peu nerveux, mais ça viendra.
C'est ici qu'on a eu le problème
la dernière fois.
On a des baisses de régime,
des variations de température.
On savait pas que
les impuretés ne brûlaient pas.
- Du mauvais fuel ?
- Oui, mais c'est bon.
On a une demi-douzaine d'autres endroits
qui pourraient nous lâcher.
C'était quoi, ça ?
C'est bon. Coupez !
Non, pas quand c'est coincé.
Le système entier s'arrêtera.
On doit trouver. Sinon le minerai
dans la chambre surchauffera
et déclenchera une réaction
qui nous enverra <i>ad patres</i>.
Dépêche ! On doit relancer.
Là. C'est ici.
- C'est bon ?
- Oui.
Sors-le de là.
- Allez. Un coup sec.
- J'arrive pas à l'attraper.
Attention, attention !
C'est trop étroit. Je peux pas passer.
On a des minerais chauds là-haut.
Vous avez intérêt à vite débloquer ça !
- Un coup sec ! Un coup sec !
- J'arrive pas à l'attraper.
J'arrive pas à l'attraper.
Je peux essayer.
Je peux essayer.
- Allez, vas-y.
- Je devrais passer.
- Vas-y, Danny !
- S'il l'enlève,
la courroie va sauter,
donc fait attention.
Voilà, comme ça.
C'est bon.
- Bien, petit.
- Fais attention.
Vas-y Danny. Débloque-le.
C'est bien, mon garçon !
Maintenant, tire.
Tire-le vers toi. Tire fort !
Tire fort, Danny.
Oui, bien joué !
Bon boulot, Danny.
Bien joué, Danny.
Maintenant, sors de là.
Docteur !
Docteur !
Docteur, vite !
Du calme, petit. On est là.
On va t'allonger.
C'est bon, petit. T'as été parfait.
Parfait. Vite. Vite.
Tout ira bien.
Tout ira bien.
Il faut plus de gaze. Calme-toi.
Cette usine est fermée !
On est en grève !
- Vous désirez, Capitaine ?
- Ouais, mon putain de Viper.
Désolée, Capitaine,
seulement les urgences.
La CAP est déjà sortie.
On a fait notre boulot.
- Comment ça, "seulement les urgences" ?
- Sur ordre de qui ?
Cally a relayé les ordres du Chef Tyrol.
On est en grève.
Amiral.
Savez-vous que votre équipe
a arrêté le travail ?
- C'est une grève générale, Monsieur.
- C'est une mutinerie.
Et vous savez ce qu'on fait aux mutins ?
On les fusille, Chef.
Il y a des laissés-pour-compte, Amiral.
Ils sont coincés dans leur job,
sans aucun contrôle sur leur vie,
ils n'ont pas la parole.
Ils sont livrés à eux-mêmes,
comme abandonnés sur une planète.
Ce n'est pas le problème.
L'équipage de ce vaisseau,
n'a pas à désobéir à un ordre,
en particulier pour mener
une foutue lutte sociale.
On a lancé la CAP.
Personne n'a abandonné son poste.
- Personne n'est mis en danger.
- C'est une mutinerie.
Et elle doit cesser, immédiatement.
Amiral, tout ce que je veux
c'est discuter avec la Présidente.
Ici, l'Amiral.
Arrêtez Cally Tyrol.
Conduisez-la, sous bonne garde,
à la baie de réparation tribord.
La baie de réparation ?
À quoi vous jouez ?
Je vais la coller contre la cloison,
et la faire exécuter pour mutinerie.
Vous avez perdu la tête ?
Cally a seulement suivi mes ordres.
C'est une meneuse.
Elle y passe en premier.
Puis au tour du reste de vos hommes :
Figurski, Seelix, Pollux.
Vous n'oserez pas.
On a un enfant.
Comprenez-moi bien.
La survie de ce vaisseau peut dépendre
de personnes qui reçoivent un ordre
qu'ils n'ont pas envie d'exécuter.
Et s'ils hésitent,
s'ils estiment
que les ordres sont parfois facultatifs,
alors ce vaisseau disparaîtra.
Ainsi que votre fils...
et toute la race humaine.
Je n'ai pas envie de faire ça, Chef.
Mais j'enverrais dix Cally,
face contre le mur,
si c'était nécessaire
pour sauver ce vaisseau et cette flotte
de la destruction.
D'accord.
Je vais y mettre fin.
Ici l'Amiral.
Vous détenez Cally ?
Passez-la-moi. Ouvrez la porte.
Ça va ?
<i>T'inquiète pas pour moi,
c'est pas mon premier tour en cellule.</i>
<i>Tout va bien.</i>
- <i>Reprenez le travail.</i>
- Ils ont cédé ?
Ouais.
Reprenez le travail.
Je le savais. OK, je m'en occupe.
Galen, je suis fière de toi.
Passe-moi le marine.
Relâchez-la.
Vous êtes libre, Chef.
Je crois qu'il y a certains sujets que
vous vouliez aborder avec la Présidente.
- Vous voulez un autre verre ?
- Je crois que j'ai assez bu.
Madame la Présidente,
j'ai vu des gens se faire enrôler
uniquement en fonction de leur origine.
Ils ont aussi été sélectionnés
pour leurs compétences.
Qui sont le résultat de leur origine.
Les Capricans
ont les métiers les plus qualifiés.
Les Aeréliens sont plus
souvent fermiers, c'est un fait.
- Un fait que je ne peux changer.
- C'est vrai.
Mais on peut essayer
d'aplanir les différences.
Beaucoup de tâches ingrates doivent être
menées tous les jours dans cette flotte.
Le nettoyage, la manutention,
la maintenance, ce genre de choses.
C'est le genre de boulot
que pourraient faire les gens...
les gens comme vous,
sans vouloir vous offenser.
Je ne le suis pas. Continuez.
Si vous laissiez ceux du Colonial One
se salir les mains, pour changer.
Accordé. Quoi d'autre ?
Ceux qui ont des boulots
dangereux et stressants
devraient tourner et se reposer.
Pour ça, il faudrait mettre en place
un programme de formation officiel.
On parlera de formation plus tard.
Aujourd'hui, on doit
s'occuper de conserver
notre force de travail actuelle
et c'est un chantier dont
le syndicat doit poser les fondations.
Le syndicat ?
Désolée, je vous croyais engagé
dans une négociation collective
au nom de l'Alliance
des travailleurs de la flotte.
- Si tel n'est pas le cas...
- Madame la Présidente,
ce syndicat est mort sur New Caprica.
Chef, les travailleurs de cette flotte,
ont besoin que quelqu'un
défende leurs intérêts.
Si cette société se divise
entre l'<i>Establishment</i> et une classe
inférieure qui n'a pas droit de cité,
on court à l'échec.
On n'aura pas besoin des Cylons.
On se détruira nous-mêmes.
La flotte qui arrivera sur Terre ne sera
que l'ombre de notre société coloniale.
Je veux me battre pour cette société
jusqu'à mon dernier souffle.
J'aimerais que vous vous battiez
pour elle, également.
Je le ferai.
Je le ferai, Madame la Présidente.
Pollux et Herschel,
vous faites le ravitaillement 43-72.
Chef Tyrol ?
Bonjour, Capitaine.
Chef, une de mes bleusailles manque à
l'appel pour le cours de vol, ce matin.
Désolé de l'apprendre.
Peut-être que vous pourrez me dire
où diable se cache Diana Seelix.
Seelix, sors du rang.
Le cours a commencé il y a 20 minutes,
Seelix. Vous voulez être pilote ou pas ?
Oui, Monsieur, mais je pensais...
Vous penserez
quand je vous dirai de penser, bleubite.
Et vous feriez mieux de jeter
un œil au planning,
comme ça vous saurez où aller
et y être à l'heure.
Et vous n'êtes pas
en tenue réglementaire.
Désolé, Capitaine,
je crois que je peux arranger ça.
- Merci, Chef.
- Tenez ça.
Il faut être officier
pour piloter un Viper.
Tu le sais.
Détachement, saluez !
Merci, Chef.
Merci.
Félicitations, Enseigne.
C'est très touchant,
mais vous deviez être en salle de
briefing 4 il y a 20 minutes, Enseigne.
Ce qui veut dire que vous prenez
déjà du retard, votre premier jour.
Alors, bougez-vous.
Ne le regardez pas, bougez-vous.
Allez.
Soyez cool.

ET ILS ONT UN PLAN
<i>Prťcťdemment dans</i>
Battlestar Galactica
<i>Leoben est un cylon trŤs malin.
Il essaiera d'entrer dans ta tÍte.</i>
Nous n'avons pas ťtť prťsentťs.
Je suis Leoben.
<i>Je veux qu'il soit interrogť.</i>
Allez-y.
Tout ceci s'est dťjŗ passť avant,
et se reproduira encore.
Votre destinťe est dťjŗ ťcrite.
J'ai vu vos radios. Beaucoup
de vieilles fractures de l'enfance.
Les enfants de parents violents
ont souvent peur de reproduire
cette violence sur leurs enfants.
Sortez†!
J'essaie de t'aider, Kara.
Je veux que tu perÁoives
la vťritť de ton existence.
La raison pour laquelle
tu as souffert et luttť si longtemps.
Et si c'ťtait vrai,
ce qu'a dit Leoben
sur ta destinťe exceptionnelle.
"La destinťe exceptionnelle
de Kara Thrace"†?
«a ressemble plutŰt
ŗ un mauvais roman, Sam.
<i>La nova ressemble
au mandala ŗ l'intťrieur du temple.</i>
Peut-Ítre est-ce un panneau...
indiquant la direction
qu'ils ont prise ensuite.
Une idťe m'est venue...
Les tableaux
dans ton appartement, sur Caprica...
Celui-ci...
ťtait dans le temple.
D'oý tu as eu l'idťe
de peindre le tien†?
C'est juste un truc que je griffonne
depuis gamine. J'aimais bien la forme.
Ils ont construit
ce temple, il y a 4 000 ans.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a†?
Juste un truc qu'a dit Leoben, une fois.
Que j'avais une destinťe.
Que tout avait dťjŗ ťtť ťcrit.
Qu'est-ce qui t'arrive†?
Rien, rendors-toi.
Tu es bien matinale.
Toi aussi.
Ouais.
Hera fait des cauchemars.
«a la rťveille en pleurs.
Le temps de la calmer,
je suis trop rťveillť pour me rendormir.
Ce qu'elle a traversť
sur New Caprica, Áa l'a marquťe.
Je sais exactement ce qu'elle ressent.
J'aurais prťfťrť
ne jamais voir le dessin de ce mandala.
Je rÍve de Áa et de ce b‚tard de Leoben
chaque foutue nuit.
J'ai l'impression de devenir folle.
Tu sais, Kara, il y a...
une psychiatre, ŗ bord du Inchon Velle.
On a pris rendez-vous pour Hera.
Tu devrais peut-Ítre la voir.
Tu dťconnes†?
La plupart des psys sont plus tarťs
que leurs patients.
Tu pourrais aussi voir cet oracle
qui campe ŗ Clebsville.
Il paraÓt qu'elle interprŤte les rÍves,
qu'elle a des visions
et qu'elle prťdit l'avenir.
«a va†?
Je sais pas.
Bonjour†?
La dťesse Aurora.
Prenez-la. Elle est ŗ vous.
- Qu'est-ce que je peux bien en faire†?
- Vous le saurez, le moment venu.
Asseyez-vous.
Je...
J'arrive pas ŗ dormir.
- Je fais des cauchemars.
- Sur le Cylon†?
Celui qui vous a retenue prisonniŤre,
sur New Caprica.
Leoben.
Il essayait juste de...
Il vous connaÓt mieux que vous ne
vous connaissez vous-mÍme, Kara Thrace.
Il connaÓt votre vraie nature.
- Votre destinťe.
- Vous ne...
«a suffit.
Ma seule destinťe, c'est d'Ítre
une fouteuse de merde de premiŤre.
Qui blesse tous ceux ŗ qui elle tient.
C'est un don de votre mŤre,
n'est-ce pas†?
Vous avez ťtť enfantťe
par une femme qui croyait
que souffrir est bon pour l'‚me,
alors vous avez souffert.
Votre vie est une ode ŗ la souffrance.
Vous voulez y croire, car...
Áa veut dire que vous portez la poisse.
Comme un cancer qui doit Ítre retirť.
Car vous entendez sa voix chaque jour.
Et vous voulez qu'elle ait raison.
Quelqu'un vous a racontť
ce que Leoben m'a dit†?
L'avez-vous jamais racontť ŗ quelqu'un†?
Vous avez retenu
la mauvaise leÁon de votre mŤre, Kara.
Vous avez confondu
le message avec le messager.
Elle essayait
de vous apprendre autre chose.
Vous ne savez rien de ma mŤre.
Mais Leoben, si.
Il a vu le motif.
- Comment il s'ajuste parfaitement.
- Silence.
Il vient pour vous.
BientŰt.
Fermez-la.
Vous ne pouvez pas l'arrÍter.
Il vous montrera le chemin.

Je prends la navette

Demande un congť. Viens avec moi.
Du repos te ferait du bien.
{\pos(192,230)}Tentant.
{\pos(192,230)}Alors fais-le.
{\pos(192,230)}«a t'engage ŗ rien, OK†?
On est pas obligťs de parler de nous.
{\pos(192,230)}J'y penserai.
{\pos(192,230)}«a, Áa veut dire non.
{\pos(192,230)}J'aime pas dire Áa,
{\pos(192,230)}mais cette tarťe d'oracle
a soulevť quelque chose.
{\pos(192,210)}Ta mŤre a foutu la merde dans ta tÍte,
bien avant Leoben.
Elle avait beaucoup de problŤmes, Sam.
{\pos(192,210)}Elle me disait que j'ťtais diffťrente
des autres gosses.
{\pos(192,210)}Que je devais Ítre une guerriŤre,
comme elle.
{\pos(192,210)}Elle m'a appris que...
{\pos(192,210)}c'est la peur qui est fatale.
{\pos(192,210)}Et que c'est la colŤre
qui te maintient en vie.
{\pos(192,210)}Et elle t'a donnť de bonnes raisons

{\pos(192,210)}T'ouvrir le cr‚ne avec

{\pos(192,180)}Je t'ai dťjŗ dit

{\pos(192,180)}Non.
{\pos(192,210)}Pendant la 1re guerre cylon,
{\pos(192,210)}elle ťtait avec
le 1er rťgiment de marine sur Mehidra.
{\pos(192,210)}Des jungles puantes, t'y croirais pas.
{\pos(192,210)}Elle en a gardť une phobie des insectes,

{\pos(192,210)}Elle dťtestait ces saloperies.
Donc je sors et j'achŤte
un tas d'insectes en plastique
et je me glisse dans sa penderie.
Et j'en mets plein sur ses chaussures.
Et†?
Elle a hurlť comme une malade.
Je rentre,
{\pos(192,210)}et elle essaie de les ťcraser
{\pos(192,210)}avec ses chaussures.
{\pos(192,210)}Mais Áa les a fait sauter
dans tous les sens.
T'as dŻ te prendre une sacrťe raclťe.
Elle a attrapť ma main, l'a mise dans

{\pos(215,220)}RAVITAILLEMENT DE LA FLOTTE 4Ťme JOUR
<i>{\pos(192,220)}Catbird, ici le Galactica.</i>
<i>{\pos(192,220)}On a eu des ennuis de soupapes.
On reprend le remplissage.</i>
<i>C'est super. Hotdog, prťpare-toi.</i>
<i>On est bon pour trois heures en plus.</i>
<i>Hotdog, qu'est-ce que tu fous†?</i>
<i>Je profite ŗ nouveau du ciel bleu.</i>
<i>C'est le seul truc de
New Caprica qui me manque.</i>
Galactica, ici Starbuck.
On a de la compagnie†!
<i>Un bandit ŗ 1 heure.
Dans la soupe ŗ 45 degrťs. J'engage.</i>
<i>Starbuck, ici Hotdog, je vois rien.
Je te suis†!</i>
Annulez le chargement.
Dťgagez immťdiatement
ces tuyŤres de carburants.
ņ tous les vaisseaux de ravitaillement,
cessez immťdiatement
toute opťration en cours.
{\pos(192,170)}Monsieur, nous avons Starbuck
et Hotdog sur le dradis,
{\pos(192,170)}mais aucun contact ennemi.
On aura du bol si on voit quelque chose.
{\pos(192,210)}Le rayonnement synchrotron
de cette planŤte
{\pos(192,210)}a foutu la merde sur tous nos dradis,
depuis notre arrivťe.
{\pos(192,210)}C'est le prix ŗ payer
pour ravitailler dans une bonne planque.
On dirait que c'est aussi une bonne
planque pour un Raider cylon.
<i>Starbuck, ici Apollo.
Qu'est-ce que tu as†?</i>
<i>Apollo, on a une cible</i>
<i>qui joue ŗ cache-cache dans les nuages.
Pas de visuel.</i>
<i>J'engage le combat.</i>
Un seul Raider lourd.
- Pas d'escorte.
- Toujours rien sur le dradis.
Si cet enfoirť saute, les Cylons
seront sur nous en une minute.
Alertez la flotte
et prťparez un saut d'urgence.
<i>Starbuck, ici Hotdog, aucun visuel
sur ton Raider, je te perds.</i>
<i>Merde, Starbuck, je vois rien†!</i>
<i>Je rťpŤte,
je t'ai perdue dans les nuages.</i>
<i>Starbuck, aucun contact ennemi en vue.
As-tu un visuel†?</i>
Affirmatif, il se cache dans les nuages.
Il vient de plonger dans la tempÍte.
<i>Tu le vois†? Tu le vois†?</i>
<i>Galactica, ici Starbuck.
J'y vais. Armes parťes.</i>
<i>Merde†! Galactica, ici Starbuck.
Je suis touchťe.</i>
Vol opťrationnel.
<i>Starbuck, tu es OK†?</i>
<i>Il m'a eue par surprise
mais tout est au vert.</i>
Oý est ce putain de Raider†?
Monsieur. Starbuck se rapproche
du seuil planťtaire.
Si Áa continue la densitť atmosphťrique
l'empÍchera de regagner l'orbite.
Et la pression l'ťcrasera
comme une vieille canette de soda.
<i>Starbuck, tu descends trop bas.
Cesse le combat et remonte.</i>
<i>Je rťpŤte, Starbuck,
tu descends trop bas.</i>
<i>Cesse le combat et remonte.</i>
<i>Starbuck...</i>
<i>Starbuck, abandonne avant de plus avoir
assez de poussťe pour remonter.</i>
<i>Starbuck, rťponds.</i>
Mais oý est-ce qu'elle va†?
<i>Starbuck...</i>
- Sors de lŗ.
<i>- Starbuck, rťponds. Tu me reÁois†?</i>
<i>Starbuck, tu es trop bas.
Dťcroche et remonte.</i>
- Redresse.
<i>- Hotdog, tu vois Starbuck†?</i>
<i>Starbuck, rťponds. Tu reÁois†?
Starbuck, redresse†!</i>
C'est un ordre. Redresse.
Putain de merde.
Apollo, ici Starbuck. Bien reÁu.
Allez†!
Oý j'ai ťtť touchťe, Chef†?
Je dirais nulle part, Capitaine.
Quoi†? J'ai senti l'impact.
J'ai cru heurter un mur en briques.
On va continuer ŗ regarder
mais jusqu'ici, pas une ťgratignure.
«a doit Ítre lŗ, bordel.
Reviens en arriŤre.
- «a fait deux fois dťjŗ.
- Alors c'est pas le film de mon canon.
Personne d'autre n'a tirť cette fois lŗ.
On a vťrifiť les logs du dradis
et ceux de ton Raptor.
Aucune trace de ton Cylon.
On sait tous que le dradis peut
dťconner prŤs de cette planŤte, Karl.
Le Raider peut avoir sautť
avant que tu tires.
Ou alors il n'a peut-Ítre jamais existť,
tout simplement.
Il ťtait lŗ.
Tu vas la consigner au sol†?
Cottle dit qu'elle est apte physiquement
mais paumťe psychologiquement.
En temps de paix,
il nous aurait tous clouťs au sol.
Alors la dťcision te revient.
Ouais.
MÍme paumťe, elle reste
mon meilleur pilote de Viper.
Il est parfois difficile d'admettre
que les meilleurs d'entre nous
peuvent pťter les plombs.
Tu penses que c'est son cas†?
Je sais pas.
Je pense que son statut
de pilote d'exception
est la seule chose qui lui
permet de tenir.
Alors, si je l'empÍche de voler...
Tout le monde peut perdre pied.
La question est†:
quand les balles
commenceront ŗ pleuvoir...
est-ce qu'elle sera ŗ la hauteur†?
Oý est-ce que tu veux aller
quand tu mordras la poussiŤre†?
Je veux aller lŗ, juste ŗ cŰtť de Kat.
Le parfait petit pilote de Viper.
Une emmerdeuse finie,
mais un sacrť ťquipier.
Tu peux me mettre ici.
ņ cŰtť de Duck et Nora.
De bons joueurs de cartes.
Une bonne faÁon de passer l'ťternitť.
D'accord, si l'un de nous deux claque,
l'autre s'assure
que sa photo va ŗ la bonne place.
«a marche†?
«a marche.
Que dit le patron
sur mon rapport de combat†?
"Starbuck a fini par toucher le fond"†?
"Inapte au service"†?
Il dit que je suis le CAG.
La dťcision m'appartient.
Et qu'est-ce que tu en dis†?
Je dis que j'aurais toujours plus
confiance en toi que dans le dradis.
Les nuages pouvaient trŤs bien
cacher quelque chose.
Alors tu penses pas que je suis dingue†?
J'ai pas dit Áa.
T'es une folle furieuse.
Aussi cinglťe et dťrangťe
que le jour oý je t'ai rencontrťe.
Et toi, t'es un salaud.
…coute,
le stress nous rend tous nerveux...
AprŤs ce que ce Cylon
t'a fait endurer sur New Caprica,
tu as eu plus que ta part.
Repose-toi.
Ou tu finiras par vraiment halluciner.
Ouais.
Il nous reste
six vaisseaux civils ŗ ravitailler.
Donc encore dix heures et on a fini.
Oui.
Starbuck†?
Qu'est-ce que vous entendez†?
Rien que la pluie.
Alors attrapez votre arme
et rentrez le chat.
Bien reÁu, Amiral.
- Madame la Prťsidente.
- Capitaine.
Comment c'est lŗ-bas†?
Une sacrťe vue.
On a presque fini.
Ensuite, on pourra sauter
loin de ce systŤme.
Ainsi soit-il.
Au fait, dťsolťe. Patron,
j'ai quelque chose pour vous.
J'ai pensť que Áa ferait une belle
figure de proue pour votre maquette.
Aurora.
- Dťesse de l'aube.
- Ouais.
Elle apporte l'ťtoile du matin
et un bon vent.
Un nouveau dťpart.
Merci.
Bonne chasse.
Merci.
Assemblage du harnais†?
Attache trois points, posťe.
Bobine d'escamotage, OK.
La dťconnection du verrou
fait passer le voyant au jaune.
«a va, Capitaine†?
Laissez-moi une minute, Chef.
Elle reste assise, lŗ.
Vous lui avez parlť†?
Parlez-lui, vous.
Je te fais pitiť†?
Tout le monde peut perdre pied.
MÍme les meilleurs.
Je n'y retournerai pas.
Je ne me fais pas confiance.
Alors, fais-moi confiance.
Je serai ton ailier.
Le CAG va jouer le numťro 2†?
Quoi qu'il en coŻte.
Comment Áa se passe, avec Dee†?
Bien, tu sais.
Non.
Mieux que bien.
«a n'a jamais ťtť aussi bien.
Je suis heureuse pour vous.
Vraiment.
C'est marrant de voir,
qu'aprŤs tout ce qu'on a traversť,
on est revenus au point de dťpart.
Tu es CAG,
et je suis ton super pilote ŗ problŤmes.
J'imagine que
c'est tout ce qu'on pourra jamais Ítre†?
<i>Starbuck, ici Apollo. Situation†?</i>
<i>Formidable.</i>
<i>Encore trente minutes
et on rentre au bercail.</i>
<i>Merde. Apollo,
cible en vue ŗ trois heures.</i>
Niveau dix, plongeant entre les nuages.
Je l'engage.
<i>Starbuck, ici Apollo. Je ne vois rien.</i>
Starbuck, ici le Galactica.
Aucun contact dradis pour votre Cylon.
<i>Apollo, ici Starbuck.</i>
<i>Canons armťs. J'engage le combat.</i>
<i>Cette fois je vais le ramener et larguer
son gros cul sur le hangar de pont.</i>
Passez la flotte en Condition 1.
Dťtachez les vannes.
Starbuck, ici Apollo.
Tu n'es plus sur le dradis.
Je ne vois plus rien.
Starbuck, ici Apollo. Je rťpŤte,
je n'ai aucun signe de toi ou du Raider.
Starbuck†!
Starbuck, au rapport.
<i>Ici, Apollo. Tu me reÁois†?</i>
<i>Starbuck, au rapport†!</i>
<i>Starbuck†!</i>
<i>Starbuck, je n'ai aucune visibilitť.
Starbuck, tu es lŗ†?</i>
<i>Kara†!</i>
<i>Bonjour, Delphes. J'ai encore
de la bombe pour vous aujourdíhui.</i>
<i>C'est le moment d'aller ŗ la plage.
La mťtťo prťvoit...</i>
FraÓche et pimpante.
On a une grosse journťe devant nous.
Allez.
Je ne suis pas ici.
Je suis dans les pommes.
Ou dans un vaisseau cylon. Vous m'avez
droguťe pour jouer ŗ vos jeux malsains.
Il n'y aucun jeu, Kara.
Il s'agit de ton destin.
Je contrŰle ma destinťe.
Ce n'est pas moi
qui ai peint ce symbole, Kara.
C'est toi.
Dans les nuages.
N'est-ce pas†?
Tu ne l'as dit ŗ personne.
Parce qu'il t'attire.
Tu sens son attraction.
Tu veux voler ŗ l'intťrieur.
Tu veux le traverser.
Mais tu as peur.
Peur de quoi†? D'un putain de nuage†?
De l'inconnu.
De la mort.
Tous tes exploits et tes acrobaties
en sont l'aveu.
Jour aprŤs jour.
Tu glisses sur le fil de l'abÓme,
puis tu t'ťloignes joyeusement.
Mais tu n'as jamais
vraiment surmontť ta peur.
Tu as peur
depuis ce jour.
Quel jour†?
Tout cela s'est dťjŗ produit
et se reproduira encore.
C'est ouvert.
Bonjour, Maman.
Difficile de croire
que Áa ne fait que six ans.
Tu as l'air tellement plus jeune.
Je l'ťtais.
Tu as finalement rťussi†?
La premiŤre dans la famille
ŗ devenir officier.
Oý va le monde†?
Ils m'ont dit que tu ťtais la meilleure
pilote qu'ils aient jamais vu.
La premiŤre fois que
je suis montťe dans le cockpit, j'ai...
su que c'ťtait mon truc.
Tout ce talent innť,
et pourtant, tu es sortie
seulement 16e de ta promotion.
- 16e sur 117 cadets, maman.
- Et tu en es fiŤre†?
Tu aurais du Ítre major.
Il paraÓt que tu as laissť une traÓnťe
de bl‚mes, d'ici jusqu'ŗ Aerilon.
Tu es indisciplinťe,
tu ne respectes pas l'autoritť.
Ce ne sont plus tes affaires.
Tu as un don, Kara.
Je l'ai toujours senti au fond de moi
et je ne te laisserai pas g‚cher Áa.
- Tu es spťciale, tu le comprends, Áa†?
- Non, c'est faux.
Tu veux pas laisser tomber
ton rÍve stupide†?
…coute, je suis vraiment dťsolťe
que tu ne sois jamais devenue officier.
Et que ton dťvouement ne t'ait apportť
qu'un appart' miteux
et cette putain de mťdaille sur le mur.
Je ne peux pas rattraper tout Áa.
- Je ne peux pas.
- Parce que t'es une l‚cheuse.
Tu l'as toujours ťtť.
T'as vu un cancťrologue†?
Repose Áa. N'y touche pas†!
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire†?
Rien.
Il n'y a rien ŗ faire.
J'ai des mťtastases.
La partie est terminťe.
- Je suis dťsolťe, Maman.
- Je veux pas de ta pitiť.
Tu ne l'as pas.
Tu veux Ítre dťsolťe pour quelqu'un†?
Sois dťsolťe pour toi.
Tu devras trouver une autre raison
de bouger ton cul.
Je ne serai plus lŗ pour le faire.
Me dis pas en plus,
que Áa va te faire pleurer.
J'ai pas besoin de Áa, je suis...
Je vais passer cette porte.
Et tu pourras la regarder chaque
putain de jour qu'il te reste ŗ vivre,
en sachant que je
ne la repasserai jamais.
Kara†!
Tu n'as pas arrÍtť de courir,
n'est-ce pas†?
Sur des kilomŤtres.
Elle a attendu lŗ.
Cinq semaines.
En espťrant ton retour.
Elle est morte seule.
J'avais peur, je ne pouvais pas voir Áa.
Il n'est pas trop tard.
Elle attend toujours.
Maman.
Tu es revenue.
J'arrive pas ŗ croire
que t'aies gardť tout Áa.
La moindre chose.
Toujours.
Maman.
Il va se passer quelque chose.
Tu sais, ce ŗ quoi
tu essayais de me prťparer†?
Je sais pas si je peux le faire.
Si, tu le peux...
Comment tu peux en Ítre sŻre†?
Tu es ma fille.
Tu vois, la mort n'est pas si terrible.
Quand enfin tu l'affrontes,
elle est belle.
Tu es libre, maintenant...
de devenir ce que tu es vraiment.
Tu n'es pas Leoben.
Je n'ai jamais prťtendu l'Ítre.
Je suis ici pour te prťparer ŗ
passer la prochaine ťtape.
Pour dťcouvrir ce qui flotte
dans l'espace entre la vie et la mort.
<i>Starbuck, ici Apollo.
Je t'ai perdue sur le dradis.</i>
<i>Je rťpŤte.</i>
<i>Je t'ai perdue.</i>
<i>Envoie ton code transpondeur,
que je te repŤre.</i>
<i>Kara†!</i>
<i>Lee.</i>
<i>Je n'ai plus peur, dťsormais.</i>
RťpŤte†?
Je n'ai plus peur, dťsormais.
Elle devrait avoir peur.
Elle s'approche du seuil planťtaire.
Apollo n'est pas loin,
la pression va les ťcraser.
- Allez, Lee, sors la de lŗ.
<i>- 90 secondes avant altitude minimum.</i>
<i>OK, Kara,</i> ťcoute-moi.
Oublie ce putain de toaster.
Prend de l'altitude ou t'es morte.
<i>On peut encore redresser,
on a pas passť le point de non-retour.</i>
<i>Kara†!</i>
60 secondes avant le seuil planťtaire.
Dee, donne la position d'Apollo
ŗ la section rouge.
Mets les Vipers en alerte.
Hotdog, Hex, dťroutez-vous vers 715.
<i>Bordel de merde, t'es oý†?</i>
Visuel. Visuel.
OK. Kara, je viens te chercher.
<i>Lee...</i>
<i>Je te reverrai de l'autre cŰtť.</i>
<i>Kara, par pitiť, ťcoute-moi. Reviens.</i>
Laisse-moi partir.
<i>Putains de Dieux, Kara†!</i>
<i>Reviens†!</i>
<i>Reviens†!</i>
C'est bon.
Laisse-moi partir.
<i>Ils m'attendent.</i>
Non†!
Non†!
Apollo, sors de lŗ, abandonne†!
Abandonne†!
Lee,
tu la vois†?
Tu peux la voir†?
<i>Nťgatif.</i>
<i>Elle...</i>
<i>Elle est partie.</i>
Elle est partie.
On envoie une escadre de secours.
On la retrouvera.
<i>Non, Papa, inutile.</i>
<i>Son vaisseau est en piŤces.</i>
<i>Son vaisseau est en piŤces.</i>
<i>Pas de parachute.</i>
<i>On l'a perdue.</i>
- =( Team Lords of Kobol )= -
Merci d'avoir regardť BSG avec
nos sous-titres.
Un problŤme, Capitaine†?
Capitaine†?
Putain, c'est quoi Áa, Chef†?
Un peu de liquide hydraulique,
pas de quoi s'inquiťter.
Non†?
Quand tu seras lŗ, ŗ siroter
ton tord-boyaux, je serai lŗ-haut.
Si ce truc se voile quand je me pose,
je serais ťcrabouillťe
comme un putain d'animal sur la route.
Tous ces vaisseaux ont des fuites,
les joints sont vieux.
- On a pas de quoi les rempla...
- Chef,
je veux pas des excuses de feignasse.
Je veux des nouveaux joints.
Kara†! Allez.
LES CYLONS FURENT CRÉÉS PAR L'HOMME
ILS SE RÉVOLTÈRENT
ILS ÉVOLUÈRENT
IL Y A DE NOMBREUSES COPIES
ET ILS ONT UN PLAN
<i>Précédemment dans</i>
Battlestar Galactica
Facilitez-vous les choses.
Donnez-nous votre livre :
"Mes victoires, mes erreurs"
par Gaius Baltar.
Les gens le lisent et ça vous dérange.
Baltar aura son procès.
Et voilà ce que vous aurez. Un ouragan.
Vous aurez des violences sectaires.
Vous aurez des tentatives d'assassinats.
Vous aurez des troubles civils
d'une ampleur jamais vue.
La Présidente souhaite accélérer
le procès de Baltar.
Elle cherche quelqu'un
pour se charger des préparatifs,
et aider à élaborer le cadre légal.
Elle veut que je t'y affecte.
- Les livres de droit de mon grand-père.
- Ça vient de ton père.

VOUS AVEZ TOUJOURS ÉTÉ
COMME UN PÈRE POUR MOI.
VOUS VOYEZ LA RESSEMBLANCE ?
JOYEUX ANNIVERSAIRE <u>JEUNE HOMME</u>,
AVEC TOUT MON AMOUR, KARA.
Oui.
Oui, je vois la ressemblance.
<i>Et un face de plus.</i>
Regardez.
Face ! Vous avez vu ça ? Quatre
d'affilée. C'est un putain de miracle.
Regardez ça encore une fois.
Ça va être face.
Regardez.
Face ! À chaque fois, vous avez vu ça ?
- C'est face.
- Et si tu descendais de là ?
Je suis bien, ici, mec.
Major ?
Oui ?
Face !
Vous avez vu ça ?
Ma chérie a trop de chance pour mourir.
Salut, Sam.
Lee.
Apollo.
Reste là, mon pote.
T'es bourré.
Descends et va te coucher. Viens.
Ça va, je vais m'asseoir.
Ça va ?
Elle n'était pas censée...
C'était pas...
- Allez, Sam.
- Non, je dois y aller.
Frak !
Frak.
Il va bien ?
- Je crois que je suis tombé.
- Sam.
Elle est toujours vivante, hein ?
Non. Elle est morte, Sam.
- Elle est morte.
- Je sais.

<i>Demande approche longue.</i>

J’aurais jamais cru que les jacasseries

Oui, Monsieur.
Votre Honneur.
T'es pas au courant.
T'étais où ? Ils viennent de l'annoncer.
Tu as gagné le tirage au sort.
Tu possèdes maintenant
un cinquième du cul de Baltar.
Tu es l'un des cinq capitaines choisis
pour être membres du jury.
Le voilà.
Frak.
Quelle perte de temps et d'énergie
de trimbaler l'avocat de Baltar
entre ici et le Zéphyr.
- M'en parle pas.
- Tu sais le pire ?
Il reste là et essaye de me chuchoter
à l'oreille quand il parle.
- J'ai un casque.
- Excusez-moi.
M. Hughes.
S'il enlève encore ses chaussures
dans mon Raptor,
je vais devoir le tuer.
Son client,
tout le monde sait qu'il est coupable.
Il a donné notre position aux Cylons.
Pourquoi offrir un procès à cet enculé ?
Parce que c'est son droit.
- Même lui. Ça s'appelle la justice.
- Ouais, c'est ça.
Baltar mort...
et Starbuck en vie,
ça, ça serait de la justice.
Y'a pas de justice.
Soûl comme il était...
Racetrack !

Madame la Présidente !
Comment comptez-vous remplacer
l'avocat de Gaius Baltar ?
Par tirage au sort, aussi ?
{\pos(192,230)}Nous sommes sûrs de le remplacer
très vite. Il y a de nombreux candidats.
{\pos(192,230)}Nous travaillons sur la liste. Suivant.
- Madame la Présidente !
- Karen.
Vu le contexte de cette explosion,
qui n'était clairement pas un accident,
{\pos(192,230)}à votre avis, est-il dans l'intérêt
de la flotte de poursuivre ce procès ?
{\pos(192,230)}Ce gouvernement
ne cédera jamais au terrorisme.
Attendez.
Laissez-moi vous dire une chose.
{\pos(192,230)}Que les choses soient bien claires.
{\pos(192,230)}Tant que je serai présidente,
{\pos(192,230)}ce gouvernement
ne laissera pas le terrorisme
{\pos(192,230)}affecter notre système judiciaire.
Nous poursuivrons le procès,
rigoureusement.
Merci à tous.
Dernière question !
Helo,
tu partiras en reconnaissance avec
l'escadrille bleue dans le secteur sept.
{\pos(192,230)}Excusez-moi, Monsieur.
C'est plutôt le secteur neuf, non ?
Exact. Neuf.
Oui, on a fait le huit la dernière fois.
{\pos(192,230)}C'est tellement calme,
les missions se mélangent.
{\pos(192,210)}OK... Inclinaison 81 à 22 degrés.
Tendez l'oreille.
Au moindre contact cylon,
arrêtez tout et filez.
Escadrille rouge,
Vous ferez la première patrouille
avec moi.
Et à partir de maintenant,
on double le quart.
Athena, j'aurai besoin de toi
exclusivement sur les navettes.
Ouais, n'oublie pas
de regarder sous ton siège.
{\pos(192,185)}T'as de la chance, Starbuck. À ta place,
j'envisagerais sérieusement d'acheter...
Racetrack, désolé.
{\pos(192,210)}Rompez.
{\pos(192,210)}C'est réconfortant de savoir
que ça ne vous effraie pas.
Que vous n'avez pas peur de défendre
le plus haï de tous les hommes.
{\pos(192,185)}La question est : pourquoi ?
Pour la célébrité, la gloire.
Vous exerciez
au tribunal de grande instance,
sur Caprica.
{\pos(192,210)}Vous pensez avoir les compétences
pour une affaire de cette importance ?
{\pos(192,210)}Je suis né pour ça.
Ça, plus le fait que je suis en vie.
Lance appartenait à ma femme.
{\pos(192,210)}N'ayez pas peur, il ne griffe
et ne mord pas autant qu'elle.
{\pos(192,210)}Si ça peut vous rassurer,
j'ai autant de mépris pour lui
que vous avez d'hésitation...
{\pos(192,210)}à m'engager.
{\pos(192,210)}Alors...
nous y voilà.
{\pos(192,210)}On peut commencer ?
J'ai besoin que tu prennes en charge
la sécurité du nouvel avocat.
{\pos(192,210)}Moi ?
Alors, ça y est, tu me cloues au sol.
{\pos(192,210)}- Tu es le seul en qui j'ai confiance.
- Dis-le clairement.
Tu me mets à l'écart.
Protéger Lampkin
est une mission importante.
J'ai besoin de ton aide.
{\pos(192,210)}Papa, je vais bien.
{\pos(192,210)}Non, c'est faux.
- Pourquoi ?
- Parce que je ne vais pas bien.
Dans ce cas,
c'est toi qui devrais faire un break.
Helo passera CAG.
Je te veux sur ce vaisseau.
Pas dehors.
Pas tant que tu n'auras pas <i>géré ça</i>.
Bien.
Je comprends.
"Gérer ça".
OK.
Je vais m'occuper de votre sécurité.
Où je mets vos bagages ?
Deux marines garderont la porte.
Mme Cassidy, le procureur,
est au fond du couloir. Le lavabo,
et les douches sont par là.
Désolé, c'est mixte.
Je peux faire autre chose ?
J'aimerais voir mon client.
Maintenant ?
- Vous êtes pilote ?
- Ouais.
Le roi des pilotes.
Si vous voulez, on peut discutailler sur
pourquoi vous êtes coincé ici, avec moi.
- Je vous amène à sa cellule.
- Non, pas là-bas.
La moitié du vaisseau
doit être à l'écoute.
Bien, sinon,
on a une salle d'interrogatoire.
Les salles d'interrogatoire
me donnent le trac.
- Je ne peux pas l'amener ici.
- Je pensais plutôt à vos quartiers.
Comment ?
Oui, avant que ce soit truffé de micros,
comme ici, probablement.
Quel est le problème ?
Vous n'avez pas fait votre lit ?
Peu importe où vous le voyez.
Je ne peux pas vous laisser seuls.
Major.
C'est bien "Major", hein ?
J'ai le droit
de rencontrer mon client, en privé,
sans qu'on nous espionne.
"La victoire appartient
à celui qui s'en soucie"
C'est écrit là-dedans.
Et ?
Je veux voir mon client,
vous vous en fichez,
je gagne.
Vous savez, vous lui ressemblez.
Vous connaissiez mon grand-père ?
Je pouvais pas le blairer.
Il m'a tout appris.
- Qu'est-ce que vous faites là ?
- Vous pouvez parler librement.
Il a signé un accord de confidentialité.
Cette comédie est pathétique.
Pathétique !
La sécurité ?
La sécurité est déjà en train de fêter
la mort prématurée de mon ancien avocat.
La seule chose qu'il ait fait, à part
la sieste, c'était de se débrouiller
pour me passer du papier en douce.
Du papier.
Vous avez du papier ?
Merci.
Le propre...
de la vie moderne
est...
l'obsession.
Dites-moi...
Vous pensez vraiment
que j'aurai un procès équitable ?
- J'en doute.
- Oui.
Mais vous ne vous êtes pas vraiment
facilité les choses, n'est-ce pas ?
- Vous vous opposez à ce que j'écrive ?
- Au contraire, continuez.
Votre nouveau manifeste montre
que vous avez beaucoup changé.
Votre petit...
mode d'emploi. Eh bien,
ça les fait cogiter.
OK.
Caprica Six.
Je m'inquiète à son sujet.
Elle est la clé.
Ils peuvent l'utiliser
pour m'anéantir.
On doit entrer en contact avec elle.
Il faut qu'on sache ce qu'elle pense.
On doit...
Je dois lui parler.
Dites-lui...
Dites-lui que je l'aime très fort.
Que je pense beaucoup à elle.
Ça se sent, en effet.
Vous devez découvrir où nous en sommes.
"On ne peut écouter
sans qu'une voix s'élève."
"Toute réponse exige une question."
"Mes victoires, mes erreurs"
par Gaius Baltar.
Vous le faites très bien.
J'ai fait mes devoirs.
Quand on aura reçu les dossiers,
je vous conseille de faire les vôtres.
Amenez-moi sur le Colonial One.
- Moi ?
- Vous êtes pilote, non ?
On ne peut pas prendre un Raptor,
comme ça. Ces choses se préparent.
Vous préférez être où, Major ? Ici,
- pour suivre le cortège funèbre ?
- De quoi vous parlez ?
Tout le monde vous regarde, comme si
vous vous vidiez de votre sang.
Vous voulez voir du vrai sang ?
Continuez comme ça.
C'est qu'il y a du répondant.
Écoutez, j'ai besoin de ces dossiers.
Si vous venez avec moi,
ils me les donneront peut-être.
Si j'attends, on découvrira que Baltar
est enceinte avant que je les obtienne.
C'est quoi votre boulot, en fait ?
Me maintenir en vie,
ou m'empêcher de faire le mien.
Désolé, Monsieur,
vous savez que vous devez rester à bord.
Ordre de l'Amiral.
Le facteur "père".
Ça va, Kelly, lâchez-moi un peu.
Je ne ferai que regarder.
Ne me faites pas ça, OK ?
J'ai suffisamment d'emmerdes.
C'est bon.
OK, on remorque l'oiseau !
Stop ! Ouvrez la porte,
ouvrez la porte !
C'était quoi, ça, bordel ?
Vous avez vu ça ?
- On aurait dit un chat !
- C'est mon chat !
Y a un putain de chat, ici !
Sortez de là, Major.
Qui a laissé un chat entrer ici ?
Il est de l'autre côté,
poussez-le par là.
Le voilà ! Il est par là !
Le voilà.
Minou ! Non, viens par là !
Viens par là.
Viens par là.
Bombe ! Bombe !
Tout le monde dégage !
Qu'est-ce que tu foutais là-bas ?
Je t'ai ordonné de faire un travail.
- Excuse-moi, je faisais mon travail.
- Te faire mener par le bout du nez ?
Cet enfoiré tire sur la corde,
et tu cèdes.
Il voulait des dossiers du Colonial One.
En plein milieu de la nuit.
Tu m'as affecté à sa sécurité.
Oui, et il y avait
une bombe sur ce vaisseau.
Et tu l'as ratée.
Sa sécurité ?
Je t'ai donné des ordres précis.
C'est Athena qui pilotait.
Tu aurais pu mourir.
Purement et simplement.
Tu es un soldat.
Vis comme tel.
Commence à agir comme tel.
Elle est morte depuis 2 semaines.
- J'avais pas vu que l'horloge tournait.
- Arrête.
Non, désolé, on est
peut-être pas faits pareil.
Arrête.
- Ne t'avise pas de quantifier ma peine.
- T'as pas idée.
- T'en as pas la moindre idée !
- Ta peine est plus profonde ?
- Bien.
- Elle est plus noble ?
Dans deux semaines,
il y aura un procès !
Je ferai le boulot
qu'on m'a confié et toi aussi !
Tu construis un putain de nid
autour de ce type.
Et tu protèges son cul.
Cet enfoiré ne plaisante plus.
Si ça avait explosé, on aurait ramassé
les morceaux à la petite cuillère.
Tous les jours,
je salue nos gars, là-bas.
La plupart sont mes amis, des gens
qui comptent pour moi.
C'est suffisamment dur
de les voir mourir au combat.
Mais jouer les taxis
pour cet enfoiré d'avocat ? De la merde.
Les Cylons veulent qu'on s'autodétruise
et c'est comme ça qu'ils procèdent.
En posant des bombes,
en nous rendant paranos.
Le plus drôle, c'est que,
quand ils auront réussi,
ils n'auront même plus à attaquer.
Ils nettoieront juste notre bordel.
Je pense qu'ils sont là.
Je pense que tu te trompes.
J'ai embrassé Nicky ce matin,
et ça aurait pu être la dernière fois.
- Cally, ça suffit.
- Quoi ? Je t'ai embrassé aussi !
Certains n'auront pas de seconde chance.
Ni de troisième...
Je vais voir l'Amiral.
Examinez bien cette chambre.
Chaque fois que vous la quittez,
mémorisez-la.
Si quoi que ce soit change,
n'y touchez pas.
Un livre change de place, des chaussures
mal rangées, une odeur différente,
vous vous tirez d'ici.
Quelqu'un frappe à la porte,
ne répondez pas. N'ouvrez pas la porte !
Vous devez faire ce que je dis.
S'ils veulent me tuer,
ils trouveront un moyen.
Maintenant, qui dois-je soudoyer
pour voir la femme cylon ?
Le propre de la vie moderne
est l'obsession.
J'ai perdu mes lunettes.
On dirait qu'elles me fuient.
La Six ?
Oui, d'accord.
Lampkin peut
rencontrer Six immédiatement,
si ça se passe dans les mêmes conditions
qu'avec le procureur, d'accord ?
Ce qui veut dire
dans la salle d'interrogatoire.
Pas là où tu dors.
Bien sûr,
mais comme tu vas siéger au Tribunal,
je présume que tu seras absent
à l'entretien, dans un souci d'équité.
- Le Major marque un point, Bill.
- Le Major se trompe.
J'ai assisté
à l'entretien du Procureur Général.
Par conséquent,
les mêmes conditions s'appliquent,
dans un souci d'équité...
M. Lampkin a quand même
le droit d'accéder aux documents
demandés au Colonial One.
Oui, c'est vrai, je m'en excuse.
Nous avons eu du mal
à localiser ces dossiers.
Nous vous les donnerons
lors de votre prochaine visite ?
Je m'excuse, nous allons
vous les donner tout de suite. Merci.
Merci à vous.
<i>J'ai cru comprendre que vous aviez
une relation amoureuse avec mon client.</i>
Gaius Baltar est un humain
brillant et talentueux.
Quand je l'ai connu,
le mensonge et la tromperie
étaient, pour lui, un art
Il était narcissique,
égoïste, inepte et vaniteux.
C'est moi qui aurais dû le trahir.
Nos affaires s'améliorent.
<i>L'amour.</i>
<i>Une évolution précoce a permis</i>
aux Cylons de le ressentir.
Je ne sais pas si le but
était stratégique, mais le résultat...
- ne réussit pas aux âmes sensibles.
- Non.
Vous auriez dû être
plus gentils avec votre mécano.
À moins que l'amour cylon
soit différent de l'amour humain,
et qu'il fasse un peu moins souffrir.
Comment le sauriez-vous ?
J'ai aimé une femme...
une très belle femme.
Mais si sérieuse.
Un visage sévère,
sur une si jolie fleur.
Son allure était si...
solennelle.
Comme si elle montait sur l'échafaud.
Notre couple a duré dix ans.
Puis il s'est brisé
sous son propre poids.
C'est ce que vous vouliez ?
Je pensais que si je pouvais l'oublier,
je pourrais tout supporter.
Je pourrais tout endurer,
être conquérant, être un homme,
résister à tous les châtiments.
Je me suis raccroché
à ce délire inutile pendant des mois.
Et ça...
jusqu'à ce que finalement,
je réalise à quel point je l'aimais.
Si ça me vidait de mes forces,
à quoi bon ?
J'avais besoin d'être avec elle.
Est-ce qu'il...
a demandé de mes nouvelles ?
Gaius ?
Il voulait savoir si vous alliez bien.
Il voulait que vous sachiez
que vous lui manquez.
Qu'il vous aime.
Comme il ne pouvait pas être là
pour vous le dire,
il m'a donné ceci, pour vous.
Il s'en servait,
malgré le risque de représailles,
pour exprimer ses sentiments,
pour faire en sorte que
son monde ressemble à quelque chose.
Pour être entendu.
<i>Il l'a caché car il savait
qu'il n'en aurait pas d'autre.</i>
Il veut que vous l'ayez.
Parce que sans vous, il ne sert à rien.
Il veut que vous l'ayez
parce qu'il ferait tout,
absolument tout,
pour être de nouveau avec vous.
Eh bien, c'est dommage...
parce qu'on ne
me laissera pas le garder.
Vous comprenez que votre sort est
entre les mains de ces personnes ?
Celles qui nous regardent.
<i>Vous comprenez
ce qui vous attend probablement.</i>
<i>Je ne pourrais pas vous aider
même s'ils me payaient dix fois</i>
<i>ce qu'ils me donnent pour Baltar.</i>
Vous n'aurez pas de procès.
Pas même un faux. Donc...
J'ai une question.
Souffrez-vous de
votre amour autant que moi ?
Oui.
J'ai l'impression qu'une partie
de notre monde vient de s'écrouler.
Laissez-nous.
Bien, Monsieur.
Pourquoi l'encourager à écrire
pour ensuite prendre son stylo ?
Il gagnera plus de sympathie
si on fait croire qu'il est bâillonné.
La tyrannie, la censure. C'est vendeur.
D'accord...
Donc, vous lui volez son stylo,
vous lui mentez, puis vous mentez à Six.
Le mal du siècle,
l'abject procédé :
le masque du mensonge.
La vérité...
c'est très surfait, j'imagine.
Quand j'avais neuf ans,
peut-être dix, mon grand-père...
Il me faisait signe.
Il faisait ça tout le temps.
Et il disait :
"Lee,
"sois un bon garçon...
"mais pas trop."
Tout le monde a ses démons.
Eux, Baltar, vous, moi.
Même les machines.
Le droit est juste
un moyen de les exorciser.
C'est ce que
le père de votre père m'a appris.
Vous voulez savoir
pourquoi je le détestais ?
Parce qu'il avait raison.
Vous le haïssiez pour avoir vu juste,
je haïssais le droit pour son injustice.
Pour ce qu'il l'a amené à faire.
Il a défendu les pires ordures.
Je me souviens d'articles sur lui :
"Le scandale".
"L'avocat fait libérer les assassins".
Ce que je ne comprends pas,
c'est pourquoi
il a prêté le flanc à ces insultes.
Vous pensez qu'il en avait
quelque chose à cirer ?
Joe Adama
ne se souciait que d'une chose.
Comprendre pourquoi
les gens font ce qu'ils font.
Pourquoi trompe-t-on ses amis ?
Pourquoi récompense-t-on ses ennemis ?
Pourquoi fait-on la guerre,
en sacrifiant notre vie
pour des causes perdues ?
Pourquoi construit-on
des machines dans l'espoir
de pallier nos faiblesses
et nos défauts ?
Pourquoi pardonne-t-on,
au mépris de la logique
et des lois de la nature,
dans un stupide acte de compassion ?
Nous sommes imparfaits.
Sans exception.
Je voulais savoir pourquoi.
Alors, j'ai fait comme lui.
J'ai passé ma vie parmi les déchus,
les corrompus, les écorchés.
Regardez-vous. Vous étiez si pressé
de me suivre dans ce Raptor.
- D'être le bad boy, le fils prodigue.
- Mon devoir était de vous protéger.
Pourquoi fourrer le nez
dans mes affaires ?
Me voilà menotté
à un éternel contradicteur.
Non, je ne suis pas...
Bon, d'accord.
J'ai fait mon lit.
Je vous suggère de faire le vôtre.
Si ce contre-interrogatoire est terminé,
j'aimerais aller chier.
L'histoire que vous avez racontée
sur la femme que vous aimiez
et que vous vouliez oublier.
C'était vrai ?
C'était vrai ?
Oui.
C'est pour lui.
Les dossiers de Colonial One.
Enfin. Je n'espérais plus
les recevoir avant la fin du procès.
Attendez. Posez ça par terre.
Bon sang. J'étais là, quand Kelly
les a scannés. C'est de la paperasse.
Et voilà.
C'est bon ?
Ça a l'air bon.
Non !
Vous avez cinq minutes, Major.
Merci.
Avant que la meute ne le trouve.
Ouvrez-le.
Les lunettes de la Présidente.
Elle est mieux sans.
Moins sévère.
L'air sévère marche bien
dans un tribunal.
À votre père.
À quel moment ?
Sur le pont.
Juste après que vous ayez trouvé
la bombe sous le Raptor.
Viens là, mon minou.
- Il ne tenait plus que par un fil.
- Ils se ternissent si vite.
Il était comme ça
quand je l'ai récupéré.
Tous les autres... Tigh, le reste...
Vous...
Tous brillants.
Le soldat en lui a fait son temps.
Il serait content
de s'asseoir dans la salle d'audience
et d'y lancer ses missiles.
Madame le Procureur Général,
au bout du couloir.
C'est pas ce que vous croyez.
Il a été pris avec
les intentions les plus pures.
Regardez la semelle.
Voyez comme elle est usée.
Elle traîne des pieds.
Vous commencez à comprendre.
Et le reste ?
C'est quoi, tout ça ?
Mes démons.
J'emprunte les choses.
J'ai perdu mes parents
quand j'avais neuf ans.
Kidnappés.
Assassinés pour...
l'argent qu'ils avaient sur eux...
Qui n'a pas suffi.
Je suis allé vivre chez un oncle.
Je le volais
pour pouvoir m'enfuir.
Que m'avez-vous pris ?
Je pensais...
à cette photo que vous gardez.
La fille. La pilote.
Celle que vous gardez.
Mais...
On vous a déjà pris assez comme ça.
J'essaierai de les lui rendre...
D'une manière ou d'une autre.
L'autre poche, à l'arrière.
Les gardes le lui ont pris.
Je leur ai emprunté
à eux.
Nous avons toujours une affaire...
en instance.
Si vous voulez m'aider...
Si vous en avez le courage...
Faites passer ça à mon client.
- Une affaire ?
- J'ai une vocation.
C'est ce que me dit une petite voix.
Vous feriez mieux d'expliquer ça.
Je sais même pas ce que c'est.
Moi, si. Où l'avez-vous eu ?
Le type qui vous réprimandait
comme un écolier.
Qui vous prenait la tête.
C'est quoi son nom ? M. Réglo ?
Kelly.
Kelly ?
J'aurais jamais laissé Athena décoller,
avec vous dans le Raptor.
Je l'aurais arrêtée. Vous le savez.
Oui, je le sais.
Vous feriez mieux de m'arrêter.
Et je ne veux pas de procès.
Je n'arrêterai pas.
J'essaierai à nouveau.
Je continuerai.
J'ai fait mon travail, Monsieur.
Un travail que je fais depuis deux ans.
Chaque jour,
j'envoie des hommes au combat.
Je les envoie à leur mort.
Tellement de morts.
J'en ai eu assez de vivre avec ça.
Si vous demandez à ce type
s'il devait choisir...
entre donner sa vie pour un Cylon
ou pour un homme,
que répondrait-il selon vous ?
Je devais faire quelque chose.
<i>XO...</i>
rétablissez le Major Adama
en tant que CAG.
Avec effet immédiat.
Content de te retrouver.
Merci.
Je suis désolé. J'avais tort, et...
- J'ai aggravé les choses.
- Non.
- Tu devrais être dans ton Viper.
- Je devrais être avec Lampkin.
Maintenant qu'on sait que c'était Kelly,
on peut relâcher un peu la sécurité.
Vu son état, Lampkin a besoin d'aide
pour préparer le procès et son dossier.
La Présidente a
plusieurs options qu'elle étudie.
Papa, pourquoi pas moi ?
Je connais le dossier,
j'ai lu les documents.
- Je comprends la stratégie de Lampkin.
- On maîtrise la situation.
Lampkin aura de l'aide.
- Je veux le faire.
- Tu es un CAG,
pas un avocat.
- Loin de là.
- Et toi, tu es un juge ?
Non, mais comme
les quatre autres hommes désignés
je sais écouter les témoignages
et prendre une décision juste.
Et je sais comment aider Lampkin.
Pas question.
J'ai besoin de toi comme CAG.
Pourquoi tu m'as donné ces livres ?
Les livres de droit de ton père.
- J'ai commis une erreur.
- En quoi ?
En quoi c'est une erreur ?
Tu as peur que je sois comme lui ?
Tu es un pilote.
Et avec Zak et Kara disparus, tu as
besoin qu'on reprenne le flambeau ?
Tu es un pilote et tu es mon fils.
Je ne veux pas regarder dans la salle
pour te voir assis de l'autre côté.
Me voir moi ?
- Ou quelqu'un d'autre ?
- Va reprendre ton service.
C'est un ordre ?
Tu es complètement dépassé.
- Va reprendre ton service.
- Est-ce que c'est un ordre ?
Je renonce à te donner des ordres.
Enlevez Apollo du tableau.
Informez Helo qu'il reste CAG.
Mon fils a des choses
plus importantes à faire.
Comment va la jambe ?
Mon coup de chance, tu veux dire ?
Ça m'a donné une raison
de ne pas venir ici.
Tôt ou tard,
on a plus d'excuses.
C'est dur de la laisser partir.
Lee...
À bientôt.

<i>Précédemment dans</i>
Battlestar Galactica
Les Cylons ont instauré
une force de police humaine.
Des centaines d'entre nous ont été
emportés par les rafles des Cylons,
Emprisonnés, questionnés, torturés.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
L'ordre d'exécuter
sommairement tous les détenus
inscrits sur la page suivante.
Il nous faut votre signature.
Signez ! De votre nom !
Les Cylons savaient
exactement où nous trouver.
- Je veux t'expliquer.
- Elle nous a trahis.
Vous savez ce qu'il faut faire.
Il vaudrait mieux pour elle
que ce soit vous.
Vous n'avez pas peur de défendre
le plus haï de tous les hommes.
J'aimerais voir mon client.
S'ils veulent me tuer,
ils trouveront un moyen.
Non !
Avec son avocat blessé, Baltar
aura besoin d'aide pour sa défense.
Papa, pourquoi pas moi ? Je connais
le dossier, j'ai lu les documents.
Tu es un CAG, pas un avocat.
Je ne te permettrai pas
de t'asseoir dans cette salle
de l'autre côté, défendant Gaius Baltar.
C'est un ordre ?
Je renonce à te donner des ordres.

Hera ?
Hera !
{\pos(192,230)}On a enfin réparé le FTL du Greenleaf.
La flotte peut à nouveau sauter.
Combien de sauts avant
de trouver la nébuleuse ?
{\pos(192,230)}Une douzaine selon mes estimations.
{\pos(192,230)}On se rapproche.
{\pos(192,230)}Toujours aucun signe des Cylons ?
{\pos(192,230)}Non. Nous avons laissé
un Raptor en arrière, après chaque saut.
{\pos(192,230)}Aucun contact Dradis,
aucun visuel, rien.
{\pos(192,230)}Changez l'ordre de mission
des Raptors de surveillance.
{\pos(192,230)}Dites-leur de rester 6 heures de plus
avant de rejoindre la flotte.
{\pos(192,230)}Bien, Monsieur.
{\pos(192,215)}À ton tour, superstar !
{\pos(192,215)}Tu sais que ce jeu n'a foutrement
rien à voir avec la réalité ?
C'est pas ce que vous disiez
au début, les bleus.
Je me fous de ce que les autres...
En arrière, vous l'aviez presque.
Il avait quoi ?
{\pos(192,215)}Cette chanson.
T'entends pas cette chanson ?
{\pos(192,215)}Non. Allez, c'est ton tour, vas-y.
{\pos(192,215)}Ouais.
{\pos(192,190)}Baltar a joué un rôle-clé
dans l'attaque des Colonies.
{\pos(192,190)}La Présidente veut
qu'il soit poursuivi pour génocide.
{\pos(192,215)}Ça ne tiendra pas.
Il n'y aucune preuve de son implication.
{\pos(192,215)}La Présidente l'a vu
avec l'une des Six sur Caprica,
{\pos(192,215)}avant les attaques.
{\pos(192,215)}Vous voulez vraiment
que j'appelle Laura Roslin à la barre
{\pos(192,215)}pour témoigner sur ses visions
provoquées par la drogue ?
On veut que vous fassiez votre
travail et qu'il soit reconnu coupable.
{\pos(192,215)}Si vous ne pouvez pas,
on trouvera quelqu'un d'autre.
{\pos(192,215)}C'est une visite de courtoisie,
pas une séance de stratégie.
{\pos(192,215)}Je poursuivrai Baltar
avec ce que je peux prouver.
Bien entendu,
je suis au service de la Présidente,
et si <i>elle</i> décide de me remplacer,
{\pos(192,215)}je suis sûre que d'autres avocats
voudraient reprendre le dossier.
{\pos(192,215)}S'il existe d'autres avocats.
{\pos(192,215)}Docteur Baltar ?
Qui êtes-vous ?
Je suis vraiment désolé, mais mon avocat
m'a donné la consigne stricte
de ne parler à aucun
membre de la presse.
Non, Docteur Baltar, je...
Je voudrais que
vous regardiez cette photo.
C'est mon fils.
Il est malade et
je voudrais que vous le bénissiez.
Le bénir...
Garde !
Désolé, je ne peux pas vous aider.
Je ne suis pas un Dieu, ni <i>le</i> Dieu,
ou quoi que ce soit qui s'y rapporte.
Je ne peux pas le bénir, désolé.
Je n'ai aucun pouvoir particulier.
- Je crois en vous.
- C'est très flatteur.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ici ?
Ça devient un vrai zoo.
Je risque la peine de mort,
j'ai besoin d'intimité.
Priez pour lui, je vous en prie.
Je vous en supplie.
- Je ferai de mon mieux.
- Vous pouvez le sauver.
C'est ça, prenez soin de vous.
Ça en fait combien ?
Cinq.
Sans compter
les 30 ou 40 qui t'ont écrit.
Je suppose qu'on n’y peut rien.
Les procès de célébrités amènent
toujours leur lot de cinglés.
Tu penses qu'ils sont fous.
J'ai vu une femme qui souffre.
Une femme qui te connaît mieux
que tu ne te connais toi-même.
Même s'ils te tuent,
ton nom restera à jamais.
<i>Galactica, ici Viper 289. En position
pour monter la garde à l'arrière.</i>
<i>Bien reçu, 289. Amuse-toi bien
à surveiller nos culs, Racetrack.</i>
Amuse-toi bien à voir
celui de Baltar se faire mettre.
OK, on s'installe.
Compte à rebours à 12 heures.
12 heures à rester ici comme
un appât sur l'hameçon,
à attendre de voir si les Cylons
continuent de nous suivre.
Ferme-la et distribue, OK ?
Comment mesurer la perte ?
Comment mesurer la perte ?
On la mesure sur les visages des morts.
Les visages qui hantent
nos mémoires et nos rêves.
Comment mesurer la perte ?
On la mesure sur nos propres visages,
ceux que l'on voit
tous les jours dans le miroir,
car elle a marqué chacun de nous.
Alors, comment mesurer la perte ?
Quand l'échelle utilisée devient...
trop difficile à appréhender,
on utilise les nombres.
Combien de morts ? Combien de mutilés ?
Combien de disparus ?
Et quand ces nombres deviennent
trop grands pour être compris,
comme ce fût le cas, il y a deux ans,
nous devons les inverser.
Nous avons commencé
à compter les vivants,
ceux d'entre nous qui ont survécu,
pour perpétuer
l'histoire de la race humaine.
44 035.
Le décompte total des survivants
des Douze Colonies
qui se sont installés sur New Caprica
sous la gouverne et la protection
de Gaius Baltar.
38 838.
Notre population
le jour de notre évasion.
Et le dernier chiffre...
Celui que personne ne veut affronter.
5 197.
5 197 des nôtres
tués, abandonnés
ou tout simplement disparus.
5 197
sur tout ce qui reste
de la race humaine...
disparus.
<i>Les citoyens des 12 Colonies
ont confié leur destin</i>
<i>et leur vie à Gaius Baltar.</i>
<i>En retour, nous n'avons eu</i>
<i>qu'un règne de terreur bouleversant
nos esprits et brisant nos cœurs.</i>
<i>Plutôt qu'un gouvernement,
nous avons eu la tyrannie.</i>
<i>Plutôt que la justice,
nous avons eu l'oppression.</i>
<i>Plutôt qu'un président,</i>
<i>nous avons eu un meurtrier.</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui, l'humanité
veut qu'il réponde de ses crimes.</i>
Gaius Baltar n'est pas une victime.
Gaius Baltar a choisi
de collaborer avec les Cylons
et a cherché activement
à tuer ses propres citoyens.
Pour cela,
il doit payer le prix fort.
Votre Honneur, la défense
souhaite désormais plaider coupable.
Pardon ?
Êtes-vous sûr de vouloir faire ça ?
Non, mais
ai-je le choix ? Il est évident
que mon client est coupable.
C'est un traître
et un meurtrier. Il ne vaut pas mieux
que les Cylons et que fait-on d'eux ?
- On les passe par le sas !
- C'est ça ! On les passe par le sas !
Cet homme nous a vendus à l'ennemi.
Cet homme est notre ennemi.
Et s'il est une chose juste et
appropriée en temps de guerre,
c'est de massacrer son ennemi !
S'offrir une revanche bien méritée !
Qu'est-ce qu'on attend ?
On n'a qu'à le tuer maintenant !
Ça serait plus facile, non ?
Plus simple.
La justice du peuple.
C'est ce qu'ils veulent.
Surtout elle.
Elle attend ça
depuis plus d'un an, maintenant.
Depuis qu'il l'a battue
dans les urnes, à la loyale.
Aujourd'hui,
elle a la possibilité de se venger
d'un homme dont le seul vrai crime
est d'avoir plié devant l'inévitable.
Gaius Baltar a sauvé la vie des gens
sur New Caprica
là où Laura Roslin
nous aurait tous vus morts.
Victimes d'une bataille perdue d'avance.
Je ne sais pas pour vous,
mais je suis content qu'elle n'ait pas
été présidente quand les cylons ont dit
"Rendez-vous ou mourrez".
Je dois ma vie à Gaius Baltar
et à sa décision, ce jour-là.
Tout comme Laura Roslin.
- Comme si tu le savais.
- Tu t'es branlé dans ta couchette.
- Espèce d'obsédé !
- Ça s'appelle de l'automédication.
C'est l'heure du contrôle.
On a quelque chose.
On a de la compagnie.
3, 4, non, 5 vaisseaux mères. Merde !
Ils sont juste au-dessus de nous.
Frak ! Missile en approche !
- Le FTL chauffe encore.
- On doit sauter.
Maintenant, putains de Dieux !
Cherchez des mouchards
dans toute la flotte.
Ils ont pu en placer un sur un vaisseau,
sur New Caprica.
Nous devrions demander à la Six.
Elle voudra peut-être nous aider.
La petite amie de Baltar.
Pourquoi elle ferait ça ?
Parce qu'elle ne veut pas voir
Hera retourner chez les Cylons.
Vous croyez qu'elle va se mouiller
pour une morveuse à moitié cylon ?
J'ai la sensation qu'elle
donnerait même sa vie pour elle.
La sensation ?
C'est plus qu'une sensation, d'accord ?
Pourquoi... Faites-le, c'est tout.
Ça ne coûte rien de demander.
Non.
Demandez à la prisonnière s'il y a
des mouchards dans la flotte.
Avec plaisir.
La Présidente, que les Dieux
bénissent son bel optimisme,
pense que vous voudriez nous expliquer
comment vos copains nous suivent.
Je suis donc là pour vous poser
la question et écouter vos mensonges.
Durant la dernière bataille, nous avons
découvert que votre vaisseau raffinerie
émet des radiations particulières.
Ils ont dû
trouver un moyen de le pister.
Qu'est-ce que vous savez d'autre ?
Quels autres secrets cliquettent
à l'intérieur de ce cerveau mécanique ?
Ne te laisse pas intimider par lui.
Il se sert de toi
pour exorciser sa propre douleur.
Pauvre vieux.
Il a perdu quelqu'un de proche.
Tu sais ce que ça fait, n'est-ce pas ?
Je sais beaucoup de choses.
Vous voulez en connaître une ?
Je suis au courant pour votre perte.
Ça fait mal, non ?
Vous vous demandez même
comment y survivre.
Je ne sais pas de quoi vous parlez.
Mais ça ne marchera pas.
Elle était tout pour lui.
Bien sûr, il ne s'en est
rendu compte qu'à sa mort.
Elle le savait ?
Elle le savait ?
Elle le savait,
combien elle comptait pour vous ?
Ou vous avez attendu qu'elle meure
pour le lui dire ?
Quoi ?
Je parie que vous lui laissiez penser
qu'elle était un fardeau.
Un poids mort sur vos épaules.
Vous autres, humains, détruisez toujours
ceux qui vous aiment, non ?
Menottez cette chose.
Colonel Tigh.
{\pos(192,255)}Excusez-moi, quelle était la question ?
{\pos(192,255)}En tant que chef de la résistance,
{\pos(192,255)}avez-vous jamais entendu dire
{\pos(192,255)}que Baltar s'opposait aux Cylons ou
qu'il essayait de contrer leurs plans ?
{\pos(192,255)}Non, il n’a jamais levé le petit doigt
pour nous aider, putain.
{\pos(192,255)}Ellen en a plus fait que lui.
{\pos(192,255)}Au moins, elle essayait de nous aider.
Par les Dieux, il est saoul.
Oui.
Oui, Ellen, votre femme.
Une autre victime
des alliés cylons de Baltar.
Oui, en effet.
Oui.
Merci, Colonel.
Le témoin est à vous.
Qu'est-il arrivé à sa femme ?
Elle travaillait pour un
des administrateurs cylons.
Elle travaillait pour eux ?
- Vous savez ce qui lui est arrivé ?
- Non, aucune idée.
Elle a dû mourir
durant l'exode de New Caprica.
Colonel.
Vous exécrez Gaius Baltar parce que
vous le considérez comme un traître,
n'est-ce pas ?
Et un lâche, et un criminel sanguinaire.
L'attaque suicide durant
la cérémonie à l'académie de police...
Gaius Baltar en était la cible,
n'est-ce pas ?
Et s'il avait eu le courage d'y aller,
comme c'était prévu,
vous et moi n'aurions pas
cette conversation aujourd'hui.
Donc vous avez ordonné
le meurtre de... combien ?
33 hommes et femmes,
seulement pour pouvoir
tuer Gaius Baltar.
Tous des traîtres.
Comme tous ceux portant cet uniforme.
Mais oui, il était la cible.
Qu'est-il arrivé à votre femme ?
Exception. Pertinence ?
- Le procureur a ouvert la voie.
- Je ne vois pas l'intérêt...
Il a raison, Amiral.
Si le procureur en a parlé, la défense
peut continuer dans cette voie.
Rejetée. Continuez.
- Qu'est-il arrivé à votre femme ?
- Sale fils de pute...
N'est-il pas vrai qu'elle collaborait
ouvertement avec les Cylons,
qu'elle travaillait en fait pour eux ?
Elle faisait semblant.
Elle leur faisait croire
qu'elle travaillait pour eux.
Je vois.
Et Baltar ne faisait pas semblant ?
En effet.
Et vous le tenez responsable de sa mort.
Avez-vous bu, aujourd'hui ?
J'ai pris un verre.
Ce n'est pas se saouler.
J'imagine que
vous aimiez bien boire avec Ellen.
Vous entendez ça ?
Il y a de la musique ici, maintenant ?
De quoi il parle ?
Gaius Baltar n'a pas ordonné
la mort de votre femme.
C'était quelqu'un d'autre, Colonel.
Qui était-ce, Colonel ?
Qui a tué Ellen ?
Allons, Colonel, nous attendons.
Dites-le-nous.
Qui était-ce ? Qui a tué Ellen ?
Je l'ai tuée !
Je l'ai tuée.
Je l'ai tuée...
Elle donnait
des informations aux Cylons.
Beaucoup d'hommes biens sont morts.
C'était ma femme,
c'était ma responsabilité.
Elle le faisait pour moi,
à ce qu'elle disait.
Pour m'éviter de retourner en prison
et de me faire encore charcuter.
Alors, je l'ai tuée.
Tout ça, à cause de cette chose, là-bas.
Tout ça, parce que
ce putain de Gaius Baltar
n'avait pas le cran
de s'opposer aux Cylons.
Parce qu'il a abandonné notre destin
aux mains des Cylons,
j'ai dû tuer mon Ellen.
Donc Gaius Baltar vous a mis
dans l'obligation de tuer votre femme.
C'est pourquoi vous le haïssez.
C'est pourquoi vous diriez
n'importe quoi, pour le voir mort.
Et comment !
Je ferais n'importe quoi,
je dirais n'importe quoi,
pour le voir mourir
dans d'atroces souffrances.
Pas d'autres questions.
Que quelqu'un arrête cette musique !
<i>Plus tôt, huit opposants
ont été arrêtés...</i>
Tu entends ce que je dis ou pas ?
Par les Dieux.
<i>Un contingent de marines
a été envoyé sur le vaisseau...</i>
- Je vous sers quoi ?
- Je ne sais pas quoi choisir.
Vous trouverez bien,
c'est vous le barman.
OK. Vous savez quoi ?
Je vais vous surprendre.
- Enfin !
- Merci.
Pas trop tôt.
Je suis un bon entraîneur, non ?
- Encore une fois.
- D'accord.
Un soir où je corrigeais
des devoirs à l'école, ils sont revenus.
Par chance, les enfants
étaient partis, il faisait nuit.
Ils ont enlevé
près de 200 des nôtres, ce soir-là.
Sur ordre direct de Baltar.
Il se trouve que nos noms
étaient inscrits sur un arrêt de mort
signé par le Dr Baltar.
Soyons absolument clairs sur ce point.
Vous affirmez que l'accusé,
Gaius Baltar,
a ordonné votre exécution ainsi
que celle de 200 autres personnes ?
Oui, tout à fait.
C'est exactement ce que j'affirme.
On doit parler.
On doit trouver un truc, n'importe quoi
pour discréditer son témoignage.
C'est une fanatique, non ?
Je sais pas si ça peut nous aider.
Vous êtes bien silencieux.
J'écoute.
Malheureusement pour vous,
je suis un excellent menteur
et pas vous.
- Donc, on vous écoute.
- Écouter quoi ?
Par les dieux, il a raison.
Vous savez vraiment quelque chose.
Vous savez quelque chose
que vous cachez.
- C'est probablement faux.
- J'aime déjà.
C'est personnel, elle ne dira
certainement rien devant moi.
Elle ! C'est à propos de Laura Roslin.
- Et vous... Dites-le ! Dites-le-moi !
- Fermez-la !
Vous vous amusez bien, là.
Ça vous amuse d'entuber le vieux,
en défendant l'ennemi public n° 1.
Ce n'est pas pour ça que je le fais.
Non ! Vous vous battez
pour la vérité et la justice
et tous ces beaux principes
gravés sur les murs de nos tribunaux.
Oui.
C'est exactement ce que je fais.
Parce que je crois en ce système.
Je crois vraiment... Je crois même que
la raclure d'égout qui nous sert
de client mérite un procès équitable.
Le système exige
que vous disiez ce que vous savez.
Ce qui vous laisse face
à une alternative très inconfortable.
Soit vous partagez ces informations,
confirmant ainsi
les principes auxquels
vous dites tenir si précieusement, soit
vous gardez ça pour vous,
et vous prouvez, une fois pour toutes,
que votre présence ici
a pour seul but de planter votre père
et de tourner en dérision
notre système judiciaire.
C'est charmant. Vraiment.
Mais je sais pourquoi je suis là.
Je n'ai pas à le prouver,
ni à vous, ni à quiconque.
Vous vous trompez.
Vous devez vous le prouver,
ou vous quitterez ce tribunal
en sachant que vous avez gardé un secret
qui aurait pu sauver sa misérable vie.
À moins de vous avoir vraiment mal jugé,
ce n'est pas quelque chose que Lee Adama
souhaite avoir sur la conscience.
Qu'est-ce que ça sera, Major ?
{\pos(192,255)}Vous allez rester sur la touche,
à réciter des sermons,
{\pos(192,255)}ou participer au procès et
{\pos(192,255)}nous fournir quelque chose d'utile ?
On y est presque.
{\pos(192,255)}Allez.
{\pos(192,255)}Allez, on y est presque.
{\pos(192,255)}Nous y voilà.
{\pos(192,255)}- Donne-moi ça
- Tu en as déjà eu assez.
Je sais, je sais. Je suis un bon gars.
Ne t'inquiète pas.
J'ai eu des bonnes nouvelles,
aujourd'hui.
On a trouvé la radiation
qu'émet le transport de tylium.
Comme la prisonnière l'avait dit.
Bien.
C'est très bien.
Il est en réparation
en ce moment.
M. Gaeta
estime que la flotte
est à neuf sauts de la nébuleuse.
En comptant le temps nécessaire
pour réparer le transport de tylium,
on y sera peut-être dans trois jours.
Plus que trois jours
avant le prochain indice
pour trouver le chemin de la Terre.
Je n'ai plus son odeur.
Je n'ai plus du tout son odeur, Bill.
J'ai gardé ses habits.
Mais son odeur n'y est plus.
Je dois y aller, Saul. Repose-toi.
Je suis désolé, pour le tribunal.
- Il n'y pas de quoi être désolé.
- Je t'ai fait honte.
Je t'ai ridiculisé.
Tu es mon plus vieil ami, Saul.
Tu ne me fais jamais honte.
Repose-toi.
Un ancien CAG peut-il faire
une suggestion radicale à l'Amiral ?
Et si on ne réparait pas
le transport de tylium ?
Les réparations ont déjà commencé.
Je sais, mais écoute ça.
On est trop proche de la nébuleuse
pour simplement réparer
en espérant que les Cylons ne
devineront pas où on va.
Si on ne répare pas et qu'on lance
le vaisseau sur une autre trajectoire,
avec deux Raptors armés
en les laissant faire quelques sauts
avant de rejoindre la flotte,
ça pourrait éloigner les Cylons.
C'est une bonne idée.
Je prendrai ça en considération.
Autre chose ?
- Comment va la Présidente ?
- Quoi ?
Elle va bien ?
Hier au tribunal,
elle semblait déconcertée.
On ne peut pas
parler du procès en dehors du tribunal.
Tu le sais ou tu devrais le savoir.
Je sais.
- Je ne demandais pas...
- Après ce que tu as fait à Tigh,
tu es la dernière personne
à qui je voudrais me confier.
Moi ?
Je n'ai rien fait à Tigh.
Il était ivre.
Je ne suis pas responsable.
Tu as tout dit à Lampkin,
à propos d'Ellen.
Je ne savais même pas, pour Ellen.
Oui, bien sûr.
Tu me traites de menteur ?
Je te traite de menteur et de lâche,
qui n'a même pas le cran
d'attaquer un homme par lui-même.
Au lieu de ça,
tu passes la main à un étranger,
et tu le laisses
poignarder Tigh dans le dos.
Et pour quoi ?
Cette ordure de traître de Gaius Baltar,
qui ne mérite même pas un procès.
Tu as fini ?
Oui.
Alors moi aussi.
Je ne servirai pas sous les ordres
d'un homme qui doute de mon intégrité.
Et je ne veux pas,
sous mon commandement, d'un officier
qui n'en a aucune.
Je vous verrai au tribunal, Amiral.
- Laissez-moi le faire.
- Pardon ?
Vous êtes sûr, Major ?
C'est Monsieur et oui, je suis sûr.
Je devrais le faire.
Vous n'allez pas laisser ma sécurité...
Nous attendons, M. Lampkin.
Si cela sied à la cour,
mon associé, M. Adama,
questionnera le témoin.
Son associé...
- La défense peut poursuivre.
- Merci.
Madame la Présidente, n'êtes-vous pas
en vie grâce à Gaius Baltar ?
Je suis en vie aujourd'hui
car les insurgés
ont réussi à arrêter mon exécution.
Ils vous ont sauvée
d'un peloton d'exécution cylon, mais
n'est-ce pas Baltar qui a sauvé votre
vie lorsque vous mouriez d'un cancer ?
Pertinence ?
Votre Honneur,
Partialité du témoin, votre Honneur !
Si la cour voulait bien
nous laisser un peu de latitude.
Accordé.
Merci.
Gaius Baltar vous a-t-il sauvée
d'un cancer mortel ?
Les connaissances scientifiques
du Docteur Baltar m'ont sauvé la vie.
Pouvez-vous être plus précise ?
Comment vous a-t-il sauvée ?
Il m'a injecté le sang d'un bébé
moitié cylon, moitié humain.
Et votre cancer a disparu ?
Totalement.
Pendant votre maladie,
quels médicaments preniez-vous ?
Je prenais beaucoup de médicaments,
à l'époque,
et je ne me souviens pas de tous.
Preniez-vous de l'extrait de Chamalla ?
Oui.
Est-il vrai que l'un
des effets secondaires du Chamalla
est une propension aux hallucinations ?
Oui, c'est l'un
des effets secondaires possibles.
Est-il donc possible
que les visions que vous avez décrites
comme des messages
des Dieux soient la conséquence
d'une réaction pharmacologique
à la prise de Chamalla ?
Le Chamalla m'a permis de voir certaines
choses prédites par les Écritures,
des choses qui vont aider
la flotte à trouver la Terre.
- Vous devriez savoir ça, Major.
- Votre Honneur.
- M. Adama, où voulez-vous en venir ?
- Une dernière question, votre Honneur.
S'il vous plaît, ne faites pas ça.
Je vous en prie.
Madame la Présidente,
prenez-vous du Chamalla
en ce moment ?
"Capitaine Apollo",
ça ne vous rappelle rien ?
J'ai toujours trouvé
que ça sonnait bien.
Je vous plains vraiment, désormais.
Le Chamalla, Mme la Présidente.
Peut-être pris dans votre thé,
pour masquer l'amertume.
Ne répondez pas.
J'arrête ce cirque, immédiatement.
Votre Honneur, si elle est droguée,
ça discrédite son témoignage.
Le témoin peut se retirer.
Objection, votre Honneur. Il essaye
manifestement de couvrir quelque chose.
Un mot de plus,
et je vous fais arrêter pour outrage.
- Amiral !
- J'aimerais entendre le témoin
- répondre à la question.
- Moi de même.
Madame la Présidente,
prenez-vous de nouveau du Chamalla ?
Oui.
Pas d'autres questions.
M. Adama,
allez-vous me demander pourquoi ?
- Pardon ?
- Pourquoi je reprends du Chamalla ?
Ce n'est pas vraiment pertinent.
Peut-être pas pour vous,
mais ça l'est pour moi.
Allez-y. Demandez-moi pourquoi.
Finissez ce que vous avez commencé.
Pourquoi reprenez-vous du Chamalla,
Mme la Présidente ?
Je reprends du Chamalla
parce que mon cancer est revenu.
{\pos(192,255)}Le fait qu'elle ait des hallucinations,
ça concerne la défense de Baltar.
{\pos(192,255)}C'est comme ça
que le système fonctionne, Dee.
{\pos(192,255)}La défense a le droit de récuser
la crédibilité d'un témoin à charge,
{\pos(192,255)}- c'est comme ça.
- Le système est pourri, Lee.
Le système a élu cet homme
à la présidence
et le système essaie de le sauver.
Ce système ne mérite pas d'être défendu.
Il mérite d'être démantelé
puis remonté de toutes pièces.
Tu sais, j'espérais...
- J'espérais te faire comprendre.
- Je comprends, Lee.
C'est pour ça que je pars.
Non, c'est faux.
Tu comprends pas, putain.
Mme la Présidente, depuis quand
savez-vous, pour le cancer ?
- Une semaine.
- À quel stade en est la maladie ?
Allez-vous recevoir une nouvelle
transfusion de l'hybride cylon ?
C'est le genre de détail
dont je m'occuperai plus tard.
Nous étudions les possibilités.
Je vous tiendrai au courant.
Le traitement a-t-il
des conséquences sur votre présidence ?
Jusqu'ici, aucune.
- Prenez-vous toujours du Chamalla ?
- Ne répondez pas.
Les hallucinations
sont-elles fréquentes ?
OK, on arrête les conneries.
- C'est terminé.
- Tory.
Trouvez-vous une autre carcasse,
bande de vautours.
Tory ! Venez ici.
Je vous vois après, merci.
Désolée. Les esprits s'échauffent
dans la flotte, ces temps-ci.
À qui le tour ?
- Karen ?
- Madame la Présidente,
combien de temps vous reste-t-il ?
Combien de temps <i>vous</i> reste-t-il,
Karen ?
- Vous vous en êtes bien tirée.
- Pas vous.
"Une autre carcasse",
par opposition à la mienne ?
Ça va faire bien, dans la presse.
- Je ne sais pas ce qui m'a pris...
- Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Vous n'êtes pas en forme.
Vous êtes distraite, fatiguée.
Franchement,
vous êtes tout simplement détestable.
C'est juste que je manque de sommeil.
Vous devez vous ressaisir rapidement
et vous concentrer sur le travail.
Sinon, je trouve quelqu'un
qui saura gérer la presse et se passer
un coup de peigne une fois par semaine.
- Lieutenant.
- Bonjour, XO.
Bonjour.
C'est temporaire, le colonel va...
- se ressaisir.
- Oui.
On utilise
le transport de tylium, comme leurre,
pour guider les Cylons sur un cap
exactement opposé au nôtre.
Quand ils auront atteint ce point,
ils recalibreront le FTL
et sauteront
au rendez-vous avec le Galactica
et le reste de la flotte, ici,
près de la Nébuleuse ionienne.
On sait si les Cylons les suivent ?
Pas encore, mais il semblerait
qu'ils ne nous suivent plus.
Notre Raptor
n'a détecté aucun signe de poursuite
depuis que le transport de tylium
a quitté la flotte.
Combien de sauts
pour atteindre la nébuleuse ?
C'est à peine croyable,
mais il n'en reste que trois.
Bien.
Autre chose, Monsieur ?
Non, c'est juste que...
ça me rappelle Caprica, quand
le temps était changeant.
Il y avait cette odeur dans l'air.
Le soleil au zénith et
pas un nuage dans le ciel, on pouvait
capter cette odeur et alors,
on savait que
quelque chose arrivait
de derrière l'horizon.
Le temps est changeant, Felix.
On doit s'y préparer.
L'orage approche.
C'est dans le vaisseau.
C'est dans ce putain de vaisseau.

<i>Et maintenant, une scène bonus
de cet épisode de Battlestar Galactica.</i>
Une question.
Vous savez qu'il est coupable ?
Il est coupable de quelque chose.
Comme vous et moi.
C'est une question de criminalité.
Ce qu'il a fait est-il un crime ?
Ce n'est pas vraiment
une histoire de loi.
Il s'agit d'une famille.
De votre famille.
Pas les Adama, proprement dit,
mais votre famille au sens large,
ceux que notre client qualifie
tendrement "d'aristocratie émergente".
La voilŗ.
C'est Áa.
La Nťbuleuse Ionienne.
Qu'est-ce qu'on va y trouver,
d'aprŤs vous†? Une balise†?
Un temple†?
Un panneau "Terre"†?
Combien de sauts avant
de trouver la nťbuleuse†?
Une douzaine, selon mes estimations.
On se rapproche.
Toujours aucun signe des Cylons.
- En arriŤre, vous l'aviez presque.
- Il avait quoi†?
Cette chanson.
T'entends pas cette chanson†?
C'est dans ce putain de vaisseau.
C'est mon fils.
Je suis dťsolť pour votre perte,
mais je n'y suis pour rien.
- Il est malade. Vous devez le bťnir.
- Le bťnir†?
Vous affirmez que l'accusť,
Gaius Baltar,
a ordonnť votre exťcution ainsi
que celle de 200 autres personnes†?
C'est exactement ce que j'affirme.
C'est un arrÍt de mort.
Vous avez vu les noms sur cette liste†?
Vous savez ce qu'ils vont leur faire†?
Gaius Baltar a choisi
de collaborer avec les Cylons
et a cherchť activement
ŗ tuer ses propres citoyens.
Madame la Prťsidente, prenez-vous
du Chamalla en ce moment†?
Ne rťpondez pas.
J'arrÍte ce cirque, immťdiatement.
Votre Honneur, si elle est droguťe,
Áa discrťdite son tťmoignage.
Je reprends du Chamalla
parce que mon cancer est revenu.
Je te traite de menteur et de l‚che.
Pour quoi†?
Cette ordure de traÓtre de Gaius Baltar.
Il ne mťrite mÍme pas de procŤs.
Je ne servirai pas sous les ordres
d'un homme qui doute de mon intťgritť.
Et je ne veux pas,
sous mon commandement, d'un officier
qui n'en a aucune.

Oui, et je ne crois pas

Ouais, comme si t'entendais

Aucune raison de s'ťnerver.

Je ne sais pas.
Je savais seulement que je devais

Je te le dis, Bill.
Ils ont mis la musique dans le vaisseau.
Je l'entends.
Je te crois.
- Je vais m'en occuper.
- Tu vas t'en occuper†?
Je te dis que les Cylons
ont sabotť notre vaisseau†!
Un sabotage avec de la musique.
Je sais. Je n'arrive pas
ŗ le comprendre moi-mÍme, mais...
Il rŤgne une trop grande confusion.
Je te promets de m'en occuper.
Je dois aller au tribunal, maintenant.
OK.
Va au tribunal.
Il doit y avoir
un moyen de sortir d'ici.
Reconnaissez-vous ce document,
Lieutenant†?
Oui, en effet. C'est un arrÍt de mort
ťmis par le bureau prťsidentiel,
sur New Caprica.
Qui a signť ce document†?
Le Prťsident Gaius Baltar.
Est-il possible que Áa soit un faux†?
Non.
Comment savez-vous
que Áa n'est pas un faux†?
Parce que j'y ťtais, je l'ai vu signer.
Quoi†? De quoi parlez-vous†?
Vous n'y ťtiez pas†!
C'est un mensonge,
une invention pure et simple.
Silence†!
Je l'ai vu le signer.
Dťcrivez-nous la scŤne, voulez-vous†?
Les Cylons ont amenť le document
dans le bureau prťsidentiel.
Ils avaient dťjŗ choisi les noms.
L'un d'entre eux,
je crois que c'ťtait une Trois,
a donnť la liste au prťsident et a dit†:
"Voici les gens qui vont Ítre exťcutťs.
Signez Áa, s'il vous plaÓt."
Il a regardť la liste.
Il a vu tous les noms.
- Et il l'a signťe.
- A-t-il protestť†?
A-t-il discutť†?
A-t-il rťsistť en quoi que ce soit†?
<i>Signez-le†!</i>
Je ne le ferai pas.
Vous devrez soulager votre conscience
d'une autre faÁon.
Signez†! De votre nom†!
<i>Signez-le†!</i>
Non.
- Il n'a jamais protestť.
- Oh, Felix.
Felix, qu'est-ce que tu fais†?
‘tez Áa de ma vue†!
- Gaius, on l'aura aprŤs.
- Veuillez maÓtriser votre client.
Ce n'est pas un secret.
Toute la flotte sait qu'il a voulu
me poignarder dans le cou,
et tu as ratť†!
Maladroit†!
- Dťsolť, votre Honneur.
- Taisez-vous.
Pas d'autre question.
Le tťmoin est ŗ vous.
- Pas de question.
- Pardon†?
- Qu'est-ce que vous...
- Le tťmoin peut se retirer.
Formidable.
- Qu'est-ce que vous foutez†?
- C'est votre parole contre la sienne.
S'il est dťcidť ŗ se parjurer,
on ne pourra rien y changer.
Nous allons devoir
adapter notre stratťgie.
La dťfense est-elle prÍte
ŗ prťsenter sa plaidoirie†?
Votre Honneur...
ŗ cet instant, s'il sied ŗ la cour...
je voudrais faire une requÍte.
La dťfense souhaite
dťnoncer un vice de procťdure.
Non, on ne veut pas de Áa†!
Je ne veux pas de Áa†!
Gaius Baltar†!
Calmez-vous, Dr Baltar.
Pour quel motif, MaÓtre†?
L'un des membres du jury
a dťjŗ prťjugť de l'issue de ce procŤs
et ťtabli la culpabilitť
de l'accusť.
C'est une accusation trŤs sťrieuse,
M. Lampkin.
Quel juge†?
Vous, Amiral.
Et pour le prouver,
je vais faire une chose inhabituelle†:
appeler M. Lee Adama ŗ la barre.
Vous vous foutez de moi†?
Gaeta nous a coulťs,
c'est le seul moyen de gagner.
Je ne tťmoignerai pas contre mon pŤre.
C'est votre choix.
D'une faÁon ou d'une autre,
- je vous appelle ŗ la barre.
- Votre Honneur,
ceci est totalement dťplacť.
Un avocat de la dťfense
ne peut Ítre appelť ŗ la barre.
Je peux vous citer de mťmoire
au moins sept prťcťdents.
Appelez votre tťmoin, MaÓtre.
Merci.
M. Adama.
M. Adama,
avez-vous rencontrť votre pŤre,
l'Amiral Adama, il y a quatre jours†?
Oui.
ņ cette occasion,
l'Amiral Adama a-t-il ťmis des doutes
sur le fait
que l'accusť mťrite un procŤs†?
Je ne cherche que la vťritť, M. Adama.
Trouvons-la.
J'attends.
Rťpondez ŗ la question.
Vous avez prÍtť serment
en tant que membre de la Cour.
Si vous ne rťpondez pas ŗ la question,
- vous entravez le systŤme judiciaire.
- Quel putain de systŤme†?
M. Adama†!
Dťsolť, votre Honneur.
Veuillez pardonner mon associť.
TrŤs bien.
Je vais essayer autre chose.
Pensez-vous
que l'accusť mťrite
un procŤs ťquitable†?
ņ vrai dire, oui, je le pense.
- Pourquoi†?
- Outre le fait
que chacun mťrite un procŤs ťquitable,
je pense qu'il n'est pas coupable des...
Votre Honneur,
je me permets de rťitťrer mon objection.
Il ne peut tťmoigner ainsi.
C'est totalement dťplacť.
- Tout ŗ fait.
- Il peut argumenter en plaidant,
- mais pas ŗ la barre.
- Je suis d'accord avec l'accusation.
Merci.
Faites appel auprŤs de la prťsidente,
si vous jugez que cela nous influence,
mais pour ma part...
je voudrais entendre
les dťclarations de ce tťmoin.
J'appuie cette demande.
- Continuez.
- Merci, votre Honneur.
M. Adama†?
- M. Adama†!
- Oui.
Pourquoi pensez-vous que l'accusť,
Gaius Baltar, mťrite d'Ítre acquittť†?
Parce que les preuves
n'ťtayent pas l'accusation.
Allons...
Est-ce que l'accusť a fait des erreurs†?
Oui, il en a faites.
De graves erreurs, mais a-t-il
commis un crime, une trahison†? Non.
C'ťtait une situation impossible.
ņ l'arrivťe des Cylons,
que pouvait-il faire†?
Qu'aurions-nous pu faire†?
Posez-vous la question,
qu'auriez-vous fait†?
Qu'auriez-vous fait†?
S'il avait refusť de se rendre,
les Cylons auraient probablement
atomisť la planŤte.
A-t-il collaborť avec les Cylons†?
Certainement.
Comme des centaines d'autres.
Quelle est la diffťrence
entre lui et eux†?
La prťsidente a accordť
une gr‚ce gťnťrale.
Ils ont tous ťtť pardonnťs.
Sans aucune question.
Le colonel Tigh.
Le colonel Tigh a tuť des douzaines de
gens dans des attaques-suicides. Graciť.
Le Lt Agathon et le Chef Tyrol ont tuť
un officier, sur le Pegasus.
Graciťs.
L'Amiral a fomentť un coup d'ťtat
militaire contre la prťsidente.
Graciť.
Et moi†?
Eh bien, par oý commencer†?
J'ai abattu un vaisseau
de transport de civils.
L'Olympic Carrier.
Plus de mille passagers ŗ bord. Graciť.
J'ai pointť mon arme
sur un officier supťrieur,
commettant ainsi
un acte de mutinerie. Graciť.
Et le jour mÍme oý Baltar
s'est rendu aux Cylons,
moi, le commandant du Pegasus, j'ai fui.
J'ai laissť tout le monde sur cette
planŤte, sans dťfense, pour des mois†!
J'ai mÍme essayť de convaincre
l'Amiral de ne jamais revenir.
De tous vous abandonner pour de bon.
S'il m'avait ťcoutť, personne
ne se serait ťchappť de cette planŤte.
Je suis le l‚che.
Je suis le traÓtre.
J'ai ťtť graciť.
Je trouve qu'on pardonne
bien des erreurs.
Nous faisons nos propres lois dťsormais,
notre propre justice.
Nous sommes inventifs,
dŤs qu'il faut tirer les gens d'affaire.
Pour tout, du vol au meurtre.
Et il le faut,
parce que...
Parce que
nous ne sommes plus une civilisation.
Nous sommes une meute.
Nous sommes en fuite et nous devons
nous battre pour survivre.
Nous devons briser les rŤgles,
faire des entorses ŗ la loi.
Nous devons improviser.
Mais pas cette fois, non.
Pas cette fois.
Pas pour Gaius Baltar.
Non, vous devez mourir.
Vous devez mourir, parce que...
parce qu'on ne vous aime pas beaucoup.
Parce que vous Ítes arrogant.
Parce que vous Ítes faible.
Parce que vous Ítes l‚che.
Le peuple veut vous ťjecter par un sas
parce que vous n'Ítes pas mort
en vous opposant aux Cylons.
C'est Áa, la justice, dťsormais†!
Vous auriez dŻ Ítre tuť sur New Caprica.
Puisque vous avez eu l'audace de vivre,
nous allons vous exťcuter.
C'est Áa, la justice†!
Non, non.
Silence†!
Ce procŤs...
Ce procŤs est basť sur les sentiments,
sur la colŤre...
l'amertume, la vengeance.
Mais par-dessus tout, sur la honte.
Sur la honte ťprouvťe
pour ce que nous avons fait aux nŰtres,
sur cette planŤte.
Et sur la culpabilitť ťprouvťe
par ceux d'entre nous
qui ont fui.
Qui ont fui...
On essaye de dťcharger tous ces remords
et toute cette honte sur un seul homme.
Pour ensuite l'ťjecter par un sas
et nous dťbarrasser de tout Áa.
Pour qu'on arrive ŗ se regarder en face.
Mais Áa ne marchera pas.
«a ne marchera pas.
Ce n'est pas Áa, la justice.
Pas pour moi.
Pas pour moi.
Pas d'autre question.
Je rťitŤre mon objection sur
le tťmoignage de l'avocat de la dťfense.
- Objection notťe.
- Merci.
Voulez-vous interroger le tťmoin†?
Je n'ai pas de question
pour l'avocat de la dťfense.
Le tťmoin peut se retirer.
Voulez-vous appeler d'autres tťmoins†?
Votre Honneur,
je ne souhaite pas
m'ťtendre sur ce sujet.
La dťfense a terminť.
TrŤs bien.
Le jury se retire pour dťlibťrer.
Quel grand moment pour la jurisprudence.
Bon travail.
La Cour†!
Avant de lire le verdict,
j'aimerais prťciser une chose.
Comme tout ce qui est humain,
la justice est imparfaite.
Elle a ses dťfauts.
Mais ce sont ces imperfections
qui nous distinguent des machines.
Et qui font peut-Ítre de nous,
une espŤce digne d'Ítre sauvťe.
Accusť, levez-vous.
Gaius Baltar,
aprŤs avoir consciencieusement
examinť les preuves, ce tribunal,
avec un vote de trois contre deux...
vous dťclare non coupable.
- Vous avez gagnť.
- Joli travail.
Allons-y.
J'ai toujours su que je serai acquittť,
mais ce verdict
ne doit pas faire oublier
que ce procŤs fut une mascarade†!
Assassin†!
Amiral, vous devez le faire sortir†!
Attrapez-le. Faites-le sortir d'ici†!
Sortez-le†!
DŤs le dťbut, j'ai su
que si on arrivait ŗ dťmontrer
la totale... Quel est ce mot†?
Hypocrisie. "Hypocrisie"
est le mot que je cherchais.
... l'hypocrisie de l'accusation, alors
les juges n'auraient d'autre choix
que de m'acquitter.
Votre confiance dťbordante
nous a bien aidťs durant la procťdure.
Je tenais ŗ vous remercier.
SincŤrement.
Du fond du cúur, je vous suis infiniment
reconnaissant de ce que vous avez fait.
Personnellement,
Áa ne m'aurait pas dťrangť de voir
l'Amiral se tortiller plus longtemps.
…coutez-moi bien.
N'en faites pas trop, Docteur.
Compris.
Romo,
il faudrait qu'on parle.
Je pense faire une tournťe
de promotion du livre, dans la flotte.
Il y a les droits d'auteur.
Et aussi ma sťcuritť,
oý je vais vivre, ce que je vais faire.
Vu les liens trŤs forts
que nous avons tissťs durant le procŤs,
je me disais†: qui mieux que vous...
En fait, maintenant que le cadre lťgal
de la flotte est en place,
mes talents, pas si nťgligeables,
sont attendus ailleurs.
J'ai bien peur
que Áa soit la fin de notre voyage.
Attendez, que...
Et moi†?
Attendez une minute, s'il vous plait.
Rťflťchissez une seconde.
Oý vais-je vivre†? Que vais-je faire†?
Comment vais-je survivre†?
Bien que je n'aime pas utiliser
de mťtaphores fťlines, Docteur...
Je pense que
vous retomberez sur vos pattes.
Fermez la porte derriŤre vous.
Romo, une question.
Quand vous m'avez appelť ŗ la barre,
vous saviez ce qui allait se passer†?
Je savais que vous ťtiez
un homme honnÍte, M. Adama.
Contrairement ŗ votre grand-pŤre.
Gaius Baltar est innocent.
Le dire me donne la chair de poule.
Non coupable ne veut pas dire innocent.
«a a dŻ Ítre
particuliŤrement difficile pour vous.
Vous ne pouviez pas...
convaincre les deux autres†?
Vous avez votť l'acquittement,
n'est-ce pas†?
Je suis obligť d'admettre
que la dťfense
a su prťsenter ses arguments.
Pas l'accusation.
Gaius Baltar est un traÓtre.
Nous le savons tous les deux.
Indťpendamment de l'issue de ce procŤs.
Rien ne nous oblige ŗ oublier.
Ni ŗ pardonner.
Mais nous devons penser ŗ l'avenir.
M. Gaeta.
Oui, Monsieur.
Prťparez le saut.
Nous allons ŗ la Nťbuleuse Ionienne.
Oui, Monsieur.
Pardon.
Les coordonnťes du saut sont transmises,
Monsieur.
Tous les vaisseaux prÍts ŗ sauter
en formation Delta.
- Commencez le saut.
- ņ vos ordres.
Saut dans trois, deux, un...
Saut.
Saut terminť.
Tous les vaisseaux sont lŗ, Monsieur.
Parfait, M. Gaeta.
Effectuez un scan dradis.
Voyons ce qu'il y a dehors.
Rapport de situation†!
Fortes variations de puissance
sur les senseurs. Je vťrifie la flotte.
Gardes, bougez-vous†!
Les bleus avec moi†!
Trouvez des torches et allumez-les.
Et l'alimentation de secours†?
Elle est hors-service,
on est sur batteries uniquement.
Parez au rallumage des moteurs.
Le CD6 doit se rassembler en bas,
immťdiatement.
Gaius. «a va aller. Suivez-moi.
- Oý m'emmenez-vous†?
- Vers votre nouvelle vie.
Venez.
Allez, on rťtablit le jus. Activez-vous,
vous savez ce que vous avez ŗ faire.
Il doit y avoir un moyen
de sortir d'ici.
... dit le bouffon au voleur,
Il rŤgne une trop grande confusion.
Je ne ressens aucun soulagement.
Chef.
C'est pas vrai.
S'il te plaÓt,
dis-moi que c'est pas vrai.
Nous y voilŗ.
AprŤs tout ce temps,
un verrou saute,
comme Áa.
Pas possible.
J'y crois pas.
On me fera pas avaler Áa. C'est...
C'est une blague. Allons†! On est pas...
Qu'est-ce que c'est†?
Cette chanson, que je....
OK, Áa suffit, bon sang†!
Verrouillez ces foutues portes.
40 ans de service.
40 ans...
Deux guerres...
Le CIC.
L'emprisonnement sur New Caprica.
Ellen.
Par les Dieux.
Pourquoi Ellen†?
Non, non, non.
Pas aprŤs tout Áa.
Pas aprŤs la rťsistance,
et l'occupation,
et voir mes amis mourir un par un
pour en arriver ŗ Áa, putain†?
- Sam.
- T'approche pas.
Vous tous, restez loin de moi.
Sam...
C'est vrai.
On est des Cylons.
Et on l'a toujours ťtť.
- Amiral, que se passe-t-il†?
- On dirait des surtensions.
Je veux un rapport d'avaries,
immťdiatement.
La coupure a touchť
toute la flotte, Amiral.
Et c'est revenu partout, simultanťment.
- Amiral†!
- Contact dradis†!
Une flotte cylon,
sur trajectoire d'interception†!
M. Gaeta, aux postes de combat,
immťdiatement. XO,
ordonnez ŗ toute la flotte,
un saut d'urgence.
Monsieur, tous les vaisseaux
se sont arrÍtťs pendant la coupure.
Il faudra au moins 20 minutes
pour faire chauffer les FTL.
On n'a pas 20 minutes.
<i>Postes de combat.

<i>Ce n'est pas un exercice.

Mon nom est Saul Tigh.
Je suis officier de la flotte coloniale.

Je peux pas faire mon boulot
sans mon Raptor.
Eh bien dťbrouille-toi...
Oý t'ťtais, bon sang†?!
Plus tard.
Mettez-moi cet oiseau dans son tube†!
Virez-moi cette ťchelle, allez†!
Activez-vous, on est attaquťs†!
Allez†! Allez†!
- Armez et chargez les tÍtes nuclťaires.
- Oui, Monsieur.
Content de vous revoir, Colonel.
Content d'Ítre ici, Amiral.
Vous pouvez compter sur moi.
Je n'en ai jamais doutť.
Je suis lŗ, si vous avez besoin de moi,

Starbuck vient de sauter.
Si vous retournez sur Caprica
et que vous me rapportez la Flèche
Je nous montrerai
le chemin de la Terre.
Starbuck ?
Je mets fin à votre présidence
dès cet instant.
Je vous mets aux arrêts,
Madame la présidente.
C'est de la mutinerie,
vous le savez ça ?
Viens.
Vois le visage et la forme
des choses à venir.
N'est-elle pas magnifique, Gaius ?
Je ne suis pas un Cylon.
Ce n'est pas vrai.
Tu ne peux combattre le destin, Sharon.
Il te rattrape, quoi que tu fasses.
- Laissez passer !
- Où est l'équipe de soins ?
Où est le Dr. Cottle ?!
Pas sur le vaisseau, en tournée
dans la flotte. Faites place !
Je suis votre nouveau coéquipier,
Bill Adama.
Saul Tigh.
Ça va aller.
Pneumo sous tension.
Je l'intube pour relâcher la pression.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Sergent de la garde,
emmenez cette chose en prison.
Oui monsieur.
Hollis, Wenzler, on y va.
Allez !
Non ! Attendez !
- Il respire !
- Je n'ai rien fait ! [Boomer]
On l'emmène à l'infirmerie, RFN.
- Valerii a tiré sur le patron.
- Quoi ?
Prêt ?
Elle doit être un Cylon.
Le Colonel commande,
vous êtes second.
Écartez-vous !
Bougez pas Capitaine.
- Sûrement pas !
- Attrapez le Capt. Adama !
Mettez-le en prison.
Colonel ! Colonel Tigh !
C'est mon père !
Colonel,
Doit-on craindre
une attaque Cylon ?
- Comment sauraient-ils où nous sommes ?
- Valerii peut leur avoir dit.
Quoi ? Comment ?
A bord du vaisseau-mère, elle a
quitté le Raptor quelques minutes
et est revenue sans son casque.
Elle peut avoir tout dit aux Cylons.
Notre position, nos défenses...
Colonel, les toasters
ont mis KO notre Cmd.
Ça doit faire partie d'un plan
plus important.
Je recommande un saut
aux coordonnées d'urgence.
Colonel, j'ai localisé le docteur Cottle.
Il est à bord du Rising Star.
Dradis !
Un contact. Vaisseau-mère Cylon.
Position 4-8-7 inclinaison 0-1-5.
Monsieur, on ne peut rester ici.
Monsieur !
Alors, quel est ton plan maintenant ?
Personnellement,
je m'en tiendrais à ce que l'on connait.
<i>Tant qu'on aura pas trouvé mieux.
Monsieur !
Dee, alertez la flotte.
Nous allons immédiatement faire un saut
aux coordonnées d'urgence.
Monsieur, le Dr. Cottle est
encore à 15 minutes d'ici.
Il devra nous rejoindre après le saut.
Monsieur !
Et pour nos hommes sur Kobol ?
S'ils sont encore en vie...
ils devront attendre.
- FTL ?
- Ok.
- Nav-con ?
- Ok !

Préparez-vous à un saut FTL immédiat

Je répète, coordonnées de fuite Alpha.
Compte à rebours à mon signal.
Maintenant.
Capitaine, que vous ont-ils fait ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
Mon père s'est fait descendre.
Quoi ?
Quelqu'un peut m'enlever
ces putains de trucs, svp ?
- Je ne suis pas autorisé à faire ça.
- Je suis derrière des putains de barreaux !
Capitaine ?
A quel point est-ce grave
pour votre père ?
Grave.
Deux balles dans la poitrine.
Le docteur Cottle est avec lui ?
Non, le docteur Cottle n'est pas à bord.

Appelé la Terre.
N'est-elle pas magnifique, Gaius ?
Je ne me rappelle pas avoir été aussi
profondément touché de toute ma vie.
Tu feras un père formidable.
Au sens figuré, bien sûr.
Et littéral.
Elle est notre enfant, Gaius.
Notre petite fille.
Quoi ?
Tu veux la tenir ?
Oui.
Oui, bien sûr que je veux.
Mais elle n'est pas réelle.
Pas plus que...
Rien de tout cela n'est...
... réel.
Elle est réelle.
Vraiment ?
Elle n'est pas encore avec toi,
mais elle le sera
bientôt.
J'ai un petit peu de mal...
J'essaie de comprendre,
je veux comprendre. Je...
Tu es la mère.
Et tu es le père.
C'est moi le père ?
Excusez-moi ?
Un rêve...
J'étais clairement en train de rêver.
Nous partons, monsieur.
Debout.
Si ça ne vous dérange pas de
porter quelque chose,
cette fois-ci, ça serait super.
SITE DE L'ACCIDENT DU RAPTOR 1
-= KOBOL =-
C'est de la sérisone, ça devrait
vous aider à respirer plus facilement.
Reste calme.
Tu te sentiras mieux
dans quelques minutes.
Excusez-moi, monsieur.
Nous devons vous relever.
- Ça fait mal
- Je sais.
Sans vouloir vous déranger,
où allons-nous, Crashdown ?
En lisière de forêt.
On peut s'y cacher
et voir le site du crash, si le Galactica
envoie une équipe de sauvetage.
Le Galactica enverra
une équipe de sauvetage.
Tout le monde à terre !
- Qu'est-ce que c'était ?
- Les Cylons ?
Seelix, attrape les munitions.
Formation en quinconce, je passe devant,
Chef, vous assurez les arrières.
Soyez prêt à vous couvrir mutuellement.
Lt. ?
Nous devrions revérifier
le matériel avant de partir.
Désolé Chef, pas le temps.
Si c'était un avion,
ils seront sur nous n'importe quand !
- Lt, nous devons être sûrs de tout avoir !
- Nous n'avons pas le temps, Chef !
Et merde !
Putain de merde !
Que se passe-t-il Saul ?
Où est la flotte ?
Nous ne savons pas,
ils ont sauté vers une autre position.
Il y a du sang sur ton pantalon.
- Pourquoi ont-ils fait ça ?
- A chaque quart
nous mettons à jour nos calculs
de saut de secours
avec de nouvelles corrections stellaires
pour compenser la dérive inertielle.
Après nous les transmettons
au reste de la flotte.
Cette fois nous étions à jour
mais pas eux.
Gaeta était censé les transmettre
au reste de la flotte.
- Donc, c'est la faute de Gaeta.
- Le gosse était débordé.
Il avait beaucoup de travail.
Si tu le dis.
- Ça ressemble à une très grosse erreur.
- J'aurais dû vérifier avant...
J'ai donné l'ordre de sauter !
Ça ne te ressemble pas, Saul.
Tu ne laisses pas les gens se relâcher.
Tu leur bottes le cul.
- Si Bill ne survit pas...
- Il survivra.
S'il ne survit pas,
ce sera ton vaisseau.
Ton commandement.
- Tout ce que je dis c'est que tu dois...
- C'est le vaisseau de Bill Adama !
C'est son commandement.
Ses ordres sont encore
paroles d'évangile sur ce vaisseau.
Donc soyons clairs...
Ce sera le commandement d'Adama
jusqu'au jour de sa mort.
Et nous ne le laisserons pas mourir.
Ainsi soit-il.
Ainsi soit-il.
R epos.
Alors, comment retrouvons-nous la flotte ?
Si nous sautons
à nos coordonnées d'origine,
nos ordinateurs de navigation
peuvent utiliser ces étoiles
pour générer une meilleure solution
en fonction de la position de la flotte.
Les Cylons nous y attendent.
Combien de temps prendra ce calcul,
une fois retourné là-bas.
Si nous cessons toute autre activité...
Douze heures.
C'est impossible de résister à un
vaisseau-mère Cylon pendant douze heures.
Nous devons y retourner,
nous ne pouvons pas rester ici.
Le Lt. Thrace ne pourra pas nous trouver
quand elle aura la Flèche de Caprica.
- Si elle retrouve la Flèche...
- Elle retrouvera la Flèche.
Capitaine vous devez être réintégré,
vous devez retourner au C.I.C.
Vous devez me dénoncer, me désavouer,
faire tout ce qu'il faudra.
Le Col. Tigh ne peut pas relocaliser
cette flotte tout seul sans votre père.
Tigh ne me laissera pas sortir d'ici,
j'ai pointé une arme sur sa tête.
Il ne l'oubliera pas de sitôt.
Je suis désolée de vous avoir
impliqué là-dedans, Capt.
Non, ne vous excusez pas.
Je savais ce que je faisais.
Je ne l'ai pas fait pour vous.
Je l'ai fait pour...
Bien, à vrai dire je l'ai fait pour...
Rien, en fin de compte.
Ce n'est pas vrai.
Vous avez pris position.
Et maintenant regardez-nous.
Regardez où vous mettez les pieds.
On s'arrête cinq minutes.
Ici.
Donne-moi le médikit.
Où est le médikit ?
Comment ça va ?
Comment ça va mon pote ?
Bien.
J'écoute les oiseaux.
C'est trop fort !
Je ne me rappelle pas la dernière
fois que j'ai entendu des oiseaux.
Reste calme, ok ?
Merde.
On n'a plus de sérisone.
C'est bon,
je vais prendre l'autre médikit.
Quel autre médikit ?
Putain, on a sauvé 2 médikits du vaisseau.
Je t'avais dit de garder les deux.
- Je n'ai vu que celui là, monsieur.
- Il y en avait deux !
-  Je suis désolé, je ne me souviens pas...
- Moi je m'en souviens !
Monsieur, ses poumons
se remplissent de fluide.
Sans une dose de sérisone rapidement,
il ne survivra pas.
Ok, Tarn.
Tu as oublié le médikit donc
tu retournes le chercher.
Prends un fusil, 3 chargeurs
et une ration.
Quoi ?!
Action !
Cally, viens-là.
Surveille nos arrières.
Lieutenant ?
- Vous ne pouvez l'envoyer seul.
- Vous discutez mes ordres, Chef ?
Non, je souligne juste un défaut
dans votre plan.
Pas besoin d'en faire
toute une affaire.
Cally et moi allons avec lui.
D'accord, très bien,
mais vous prendrez soin de Cally ?
Cally ?
Donne-moi le fusil.
On y va tous les trois.
Laisse ça, laisse ton sac à dos.
Arme au poing.
Tarn, tu couvres l'arrière,
toi au centre.
On regarde et on écoute.
CAPRICA SOUS OCCUPATION CYLON
MUSÉE DE DELPHES
Sa conscience se télécharge
vers un autre corps en ce moment même.
Et quand elle se réveillera,
elle leur dira exactement où nous sommes.
Elle a raison, on ne peut pas rester ici.
Elle a raison, hein ?
Sharon le Cylon a raison.
Tout ça c'est juste...
"Écoute Sharon le Cylon."
"Fais ce qu'elle dit"
"Parce que c'est une bonne idée."
Hé, Kara, elle m'a aidé jusqu'ici.
Ok, j'ai compris.
J'ai compris, Helo !
Toi et moi ça remonte à loin,
alors je comprends.
Je sais ce que tu ressentais pour elle,
mais ce n'est pas la vraie Sharon.
C'est une copie bon marché.
Je ne suis pas une copie.
Je suis Sharon.
Je me rappelle le jour où
je t'ai rencontrée.
Tu vomissais tes tripes parce que
t'avais mangé de mauvaises huîtres à...
Ne fais pas ça !
Je n'aime pas ça,
et je ne t'aime pas toi.
Alors la meilleure chose à faire
c'est de fermer ta putain de gueule.
Baisse ça pour l'amour des Dieux.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux de moi, Helo ?
C'est un Cylon !
Tu t'es fait avoir.
On s'est fait avoir.
Alors quoi,
je dois être gentille avec elle ?
Parce qu'elle dit qu'elle est enceinte ?
Écarte-toi.
Non.
Carl, ne pense pas
que je ne pourrais pas...
Je ne te laisserai pas la tuer !
D'accord ? Elle porte mon enfant.
Mes... Dieux !
Les hommes sont tellement cons des fois !
Comment tu sais ça ?
Je le sais, d'accord ?
Elle ne ment pas.
Ils mentent sur tout, Helo.
Leur existence toute entière
est un mensonge.
Ils ne sont pas humains, Helo.
Ce sont des machines.
Tu ne peux pas avoir d'enfant
avec une machine !
Je ne sais pas quoi te dire, ok ?
Mais je la crois.
C'est difficile à expliquer.
Ça fait un moment qu'on est ensemble.
Je veux dire. Je sais ce qu'elle est
mais elle n'est pas comme les autres.
Elle ne l'est pas.
Non non non non !
Cette salope a pris mon engin.
Comment va-t-il ?
Les balles lui ont déchiré la rate.
Sa pression sanguine est très basse.
Quelqu'un doit ouvrir pour
stopper l'hémorragie ou on le perdra.
Alors, c'est quoi ton plan ?
Je n'en ai pas vraiment.
Je retourne dans le cockpit.
Je retourne dans ma... flotte !
Et je veux que tu viennes avec moi, Saul.
Tu crois vraiment qu'on peut
retourner dans la flotte ?
Oui, je le crois.
Oui, je le crois.
Dans combien de temps
le docteur Cottle sera à bord ?
Je ne sais pas.
Ça peut être dans longtemps.
Il n'a pas beaucoup de temps, monsieur.
Il va falloir que vous opériez
vous-même.
- Je ne suis qu'infirmière.
- Aujourd'hui vous êtes docteur.
Colonel.
Ouvrez la cellule.
Comment va le commandant ?
Vous avez raté votre coup.
Si c'est ce que vous demandez.
Alors il est en vie.
Merci aux Dieux.
Combien de nos pilotes
sont des Cylons ?
Je ne sais pas.
Qui a donné l'ordre
de descendre le patron ?
Personne.
Finissons-en, putain de lâche !
Donnez-moi votre arme.
Donnez-moi votre flingue !
Oui, monsieur.
Tuez-moi.
Qu'on en finisse.
Ok, Tarn.
Avance, jette un oeil.
Si ce n'est pas là, c'est au Raptor.
Et on devra pousser un peu plus.
Je l'ai, Chef.
Très bien, on se tire d'ici.
Tarn à l'avant.
On  y va !
Allez, allez.
Ça ne rime à rien.
Pourquoi je porte le médikit
si c'est toi qui l'a oublié ?
OK. Premièrement,
c'est le médikit du lieutenant.
Deuxièmement, je suis à l'avant.
Comme tu veux...
Très bien les enfants, ça suffit.
Je vais te dire, Cally.
Si ça peut te réconforter,
Il sera de corvée de nettoyage
- avec toi la semaine prochaine.
- Ça c'est parlé !
Pourquoi ?!
Si quelqu'un devait être de corvée,
c'est le Lt.
Allez ! A terre !
En haut de la colline !
Cally, prends le fusil et couvre-moi.
Tir de couverture !
Ok, ok, attends-moi.
Attends-moi, d'accord ?
Allez allez allez allez.
Ne bouge pas !
Je viens te chercher, ne bouge pas !
S'il vous plaît !
J'arrive, Cally !
Tire ! Cally, allez, allez !
- Ils sont planqués, je ne les vois pas !
- Couvre-moi !
Tarn, tiens bon, tiens bon !
Chef !
Venez Chef !
Tu vas bien, tu vas bien.
Tout va bien, tout va bien.
Viens sur mon dos, viens sur mon dos.
Viens sur moi, viens sur moi.
Chef !
Chef ?
- Ils ne nous suivent plus.
- Cally, ici, ici.
Je sais que t'es touché mon pote,
Je vais regarder ça tout de suite.
Je vais le mettre ici, Cal.
Reste couché... ici.
Tu restes avec moi, ok ?
Je vais regarder ça tout de suite.
Ce nest pas si mauvais.
Ce nest pas si mauvais.
Cally, surveille la colline.
- Je veux rentrer.
- Je sais, je sais, on rentre.
Ok ? Ok.
... Le médikit, tu crois qu'ils...
C'est bon. C'est bon. C'est bon.
C'est bon. Reste avec moi.
Regarde-moi. Regarde-moi.
Reste avec moi. Reste avec moi.
Avec moi. Avec moi. Allez...
Allez...
Chef ?
Chef, il faut y aller.
Il faut y aller.
Il faut y aller.
Chef.
Dieux ! Ça y est,
espèce de stupide putain de merde !
Chef, Socinus a besoin de nous. Allez.
Venez.
On y va.
Ce n'est pas de votre faute, Lieutenant.
Pas de là où j'étais.
C'était moi le O.O.D.
C'était dingue là-dedans, monsieur.
Ne rejetez pas la faute sur vous.
Donc, nous sautons vers
nos dernières coordonnées.
Mais nous mettons en réseau
l'ordinateur FTL
avec ceux de la navigation, du DC
et de l'anti-incendie.
Une fois reliés, nous ne mettrons que
10 minutes pour faire tous les calculs.
Vous n'êtes pas sérieux...
Le patron n'aurait
jamais fait cela, Colonel.
- Aucun réseau informatique sur ce vaisseau.
- Je le reconnais, monsieur.
Mais je peux concevoir un firewall
qui nous fera gagner du temps.
Vraiment, vous allez surpasser les Cylons
en programmation informatique ?
Si on ne fait pas ça,
jamais on ne retrouvera la flotte.
En tous cas pas avant
que le Commandant soit mort.
Nous sommes encore sous
les ordres du patron.
On ne peux faire
ce qu'il réprouverait,
surtout quand ça met
tout le vaisseau en danger.
Ici le XO.
Commencez les préparatifs de saut.
Ce sont... mes ordres.
Le gamin est de retour dans la flotte.
Que la vérité soit faite.
Alors, comment t'as fait ? Comment tu
t'es sorti de ce putain de cargo ?
Les relations.
Le père d'Anne a un ami dans
le sous-comité de la défense.
La nouvelle épouse tombe à pic. J'aurais
aimé avoir une belle famille influente.
Donne-moi deux ans.
J'aurai de l'influence.
Attend de voir.
J'aurai mon propre Battlestar un jour.
Ouvrez, s'il vous plaît.
Très bien.
Vous avez ma parole.
Pendant le service,
je n'essaierai pas de la libérer
ou de provoquer
une insurrection de l'équipage.
Et en dehors du service, je me
présenterai directement à cette cellule.
Le briefing d'avant-vol va commencer.
Bien.
Bonne chasse, Capitaine.
Merci, madame la présidente !
Une fois que vous aurez trouvé
la flotte, j'aimerais vous dire deux mots.
Il n'y a rien à discuter. Vous avez
défié le patron et vous avez perdu.
On saute dedans...
On retient les Cylons,
on fait nos calculs
et on saute ailleurs.
C'est tout. Un plan simple.
Pas si simple à faire.
Les ordinateurs sont en réseau.
Mon tableau est vert, monsieur.
Tous les postes sont prêts pour le saut.
Ce firewall est prêt ?
J'ai fait de mon mieux.
J'aurais aimé que le Dr Baltar soit là.
Foutaises. Vous remplacez ce fils
de pute sournois quand vous voulez.
Prêt. Dans cinq, quatre,
trois, deux, saut.
- Saut effectué.
- Au rapport ?
Contacts Dradis multiples.
Vaisseau-mère Cylon et...
plusieurs Raiders Cylon
position 4-8-7 inclinaison 2-2-1.
Lieutenant...
Calculs en cours.
Nous pourrons déterminer la position
de la flotte dans sept minutes.
On va se les faire ces tarés !
Flyboy, tu sais qu'il y a
une cagnotte en cours ?
On va voir qui en descend le plus
maintenant que Starbuck n'est plus là.
- On sait que je vais tout nettoyer.
- Flyboy, ferme-la et concentre-toi.
Ce n'est pas une simulation.
Bien compris.
Son cœur s'est arrêté !
Défibrilateur !
L'électricité flanche, les batteries sont
aux postes de secours.
Ok, alors donnez moi un couteau.
Armement prêt.
<i>Supports ouverts.</i>
<i>On y va !</i>
Les voilà.
Les Cylons piratent notre réseau.
Ils essaient d'accéder à notre passerelle.
Maintenant, c'est la course.
Premier firewall pénétré.
Sierra Alpha, nous avons
un nouvel appareil ennemi.
<i>C'est quoi que ce truc ?
Je ne sais pas, mais
ça se dirige vers le Galactica.
On doit le descendre.
Apollo, Hotdog en attaque.
Trois à droite, cinq à deux heures.
Tally, Hotdog. Comptez sur moi.
<i>Compris. Je suis avec vous, leader.</i>
Voulez-vous prier avec moi ?
Aidez-nous, Seigneurs de Kobol.
Aidez votre prophète Laura
à nous guider sur le chemin de la vertu.
Que nous puissions...
Que nous puissions détruire nos ennemis.
Laissez-nous marcher
sur le chemin de la vertu
et lever notre tête vers votre bonté.
Aidez-nous à nous à nous détourner
de l'appel du malin.
et montrez-nous la voie du salut.
Nous vous offrons cette prière.
Calculs à 56%.
Le second firewall a été percé.
Frack, ils sont rapides !
Le troisième firewall est tombé !
<i>Appolo, vous approchez de la barrière
de tir du Galactica.</i>
<i>Cibles cylons à portée de tir.</i>
Je l'ai touché !
On entre dans la zone
de combat du Galactica !
J'y suis presque, Allez !
Reculez !
Reculez !
Et merde !
Je l'avais !
Apollo rapporte des impacts
sur la nacelle de vol tribord.
La nacelle de vol a décompressé.
Pas d'explosion.
Pas de feu.
Je répète, pas de feu.
Pas de feu.
80%. On y est presque.
Ils ont passé le quatrième firewall.
Plus qu'un et ils accèdent
à notre unité centrale.
Connards.
C'était le mien !
Nous avons une solution
pour la position de la flotte.
Coupez le réseau.
Le réseau est coupé ! Les ordinateurs
sont maintenant en contrôle local.
Dites aux Vipers de rentrer.
On a une chance terrible aujourd'hui.
Préparez-vous à sauter.
<i>Les Vipers sont à bord, Monsieur.</i>
Prêt.
Dans cinq, quatre, trois, deux...
Saut.
- Saut effectué.
- Au rapport ?
Contacts multiples autour de nous.
Transpondeur colonial, Monsieur.
On les a trouvés !
Capitaine Kelly.
- Lieutenant Gaeta.
- Monsieur.
Dee, contactez le Rising Star.
Dites à Cottle de ramener son cul
ici le plus vite possible.
Putain de boulot.
A partir de maintenant,
plus de massage cardiaque pour moi.
Je m'en tiens aux pilules
et aux lavements.
Monsieur.
Je vous écoute.
Eh bien,
j'ai réussi à arrêter l'hémorragie.
Mais il est toujours
dans un état critique.
Le docteur va arriver.
Tu m'entends, Bill ?
Allez-vous-en.
Capitaine Tigh,
c'est le détachement de police militaire.
Sergent Watkins, Monsieur.
Ouvrez s'il vous plait.
Le major Adama vous envoie ses respects.
Il vous informe que vous avez été
réintégré dans la flotte coloniale.
Au rang de Capitaine.
Major Adama.
Bon retour dans la flotte, Monsieur.
J'arrive tout de suite, Sergent.
Oui, Capitaine.
Tu n'aurais jamais dû
me rappeler au service.
Si tu m'avais laissé, je serais mort
à Caprica avec tous les autres
et j'en aurai été heureux.
Je ne veux pas commander.
Je ne l'ai jamais voulu.
Ne t'avise pas de mourir maintenant.
A suivre...

Si vous retournez sur Caprica,
et me ramenez la flÍche...
Je nous montrerai
la voie vers la Terre.
Qu'attends-tu de moi, Helo†?
C'est un Cylon†!
Je ne vais pas te laisser la tuer.
D'accord†?
Elle porte mon enfant.
Cette salope a pris mon engin.
Vous Ítes en ťtat d'arrestation.
Madame la Prťsidente,
C'est de la mutinerie.
Vous le savez.
Je mets fin ŗ votre mandat prťsidentiel
dŤs ŗ prťsent.
Je recommande un saut
aux coordonnťes d'urgence.
Que faÓtes-vous de
nos hommes sur Kobol†?
S'ils sont toujours en vie,
ils vont devoir attendre.
Il ne va pas survivre.
Tarn, tu as oubliť le mťdikit donc
tu retournes le rťcupťrer.
- Vous ne pouvez pas l'envoyer seul†!
- Vous discutez mes ordres, Chef†?
Je ne veux pas commander.
Je ne l'ai jamais voulu.
Ne t'avise pas de mourir maintenant.
Les Cylons sont en train
d'infiltrer le rťseau.
Ils tentent d'accťder
ŗ notre serveur central.
C'est quoi ce truc†?!
Je ne sais pas, mais quoi que ce soit,
Áa va vers le Galactica,
On doit s'en dťbarrasser.
Salut†!
Hum... Salut.
<i>Equipe de contrŰle des dťg‚ts

- Quelle journťe, hein†?
- Oui.
Et bien, je...
- Je ne t'avais pas vu depuis...
- Deux semaines.
J'ai beaucoup pensť ŗ toi.
C'est gentil.
Je dois y aller.
Eh, Dee...
Dee†!
…coute...
Je sais que je n'ai pas
vraiment fait d'efforts,
ou que j'ai dŻ avoir l'air
de ne pas avoir fait d'efforts...
afin que cela,
quoi que ce "cela" signifie,
soit une prioritť.
- Mais...
- Mais†?
Mais tu ťtais trop occupť ŗ organiser
une mutinerie sur mon vaisseau†?
Ou bien tu voulais attendre
d'Ítre vraiment dťsespťrť,
et d'avoir besoin d'une ťpaule
pour pleurer avant de venir vers moi†?
Je pense que tu vas un peu loin.
Oui... Je suis dťsolťe.
Tu as raison.
Je dois y aller.
C'est quoi ce bordel†?
- Prenez les lampes torches
- ReÁu.
Vťrifiez le respirateur.
«a ne marche plus†?
- Au rapport†!
- On vťrifie.
Vťrifiez les sous-systŤmes.
Et lancez les gťnťrateurs de secours.

Flyboy†!
Hotdog†!
Joli travail ma poule.
Oh†! Oui†!
Kat, viens par lŗ†!
Ici le XO, Sitrep†!
C'est le virus, monsieur.
Je pense qu'il a dŻ gťnťrer
<i>des copies de lui mÍme
sur d'autres ordinateurs.</i>
Il a dťsactivť le gťnťrateur principal
et les unitťs auxiliaires.
L'ťnergie de secours
vient juste de revenir.
Capitaine†!
C'ťtait du beau boulot dehors.
Je ne vois pas ce qui
vous rend si content.
On a merdť.
- Un des nŰtres y est restť.
- Oui, monsieur.
- Que se passe-t-il avec les lumiŤres†?
- Je ne sais pas...
Nous ne savons toujours pas
si nous pouvons contacter
<i>le reste du vaisseau.</i>
- C'ťtait quoi Áa†?
- Je ne suis pas sŻr, monsieur.
Je vťrifie.
Plus d'ťnergie, monsieur.
Dans tous le vaisseau.
Seuls les tťlťphones
analogiques fonctionnent.
J'ai essayť d'avoir le ContrŰle des Dťg‚ts
mais les lignes ont sautť.
Ok, amarrez les vaisseaux,
et faites le point sur le matťriel.
Je vais au central,
pour voir ce qu'il se passe.
Rťpťtez.
Prťsence cylon signalťe
dans le module tribord.
Nous avons ťtť abordťs.
- Ok la bleusaille, bougez-vous.
- Quand je suis arrivť dans son dos,
Il s'est retournť, alors j'ai descendu
ce cafard. C'ťtait clair, net et prťcis.
Tu as vu quand j'ai fait face
aux deux ŗ b‚bord†?
J'ai vu, c'ťtait bien jouť.
J'ai virť, tirť sur le manche,
freinť, et lŗ†: BOUM†!
Celui ŗ gauche ťtait en plein
dans mon viseur.
Je l'ai mis en piŤces et j'ai virť

Qu'est-ce que c'ťtait†?
Les Cylons ont brouillť le signal.
Gťnial...
- Ce sont des coups de feu†?
- Oui.
On ne peut pas rester ici.
Ouvrez la porte.
Vous savez que je ne peux pas,
Mme la Prťsidente.
Caporal Venner, je n'ai pas l'intention
de rester enfermťe dans cette cellule
et d'Ítre tuťe comme un rat dans une cage.
Ouvrez cette porte†!
Merci.
Cpl Venner, ne tirez pas†!
Ici le capitaine Adama.
J'ai une ťquipe d'assaut avec moi.
Entrez Capitaine.
Surveillez l'escalier des cabines.
- Sťcurisť.
- Nous avons ťtť abordťs.
Ce pont grouille de Cylons.
- Ils vont vers les dťpŰts d'armes.*
- Comment pouvons-nous aider†?
En restant en vie,
en ťvitant les balles,
on se charge des Cylons.
Ok, l'infirmerie est le lieu le plus sŻr.
C'est suffisamment loin
de toute cible potentielle,
et c'est conÁu
pour faire office d'abri
au cas oý le vaisseau serait perdu.
Bonington, votre arme de poing.
Ok, Billy...
Vous avez dťjŗ tenu une arme†?
Le pistolet ŗ air comprimť de mon oncle,
je devais avoir 10 ans.
Le principe est le mÍme.
Le vrai fait juste
un peu plus de bruit.
Madame la Prťsidente.
Non merci, je ne peux pas.
Caporal, vous avez pour mission
de l'escorter jusqu'ŗ l'infirmerie.
Bonington vous escortera.
Souvenez-vous de rester

Bien.
Et vous†?
Nous allons vers les coups de feu.
Ok, ťcoutez.
Il y a une rťserve d'armes lťgŤres dans

On va chercher des balles explosives
et on file vers les dťpŰts d'explosifs.

- Passez devant.
- Oui monsieur.
- Bonne chance, Capitaine.
Que les Dieux vous protŤgent.
Vous aussi.
- Dťgagť†!
- Ok, allons y.
CAPRICA SOUS OCCUPATION CYLON
On devrait sortir de la ville,
partir ŗ la recherche d'une
de nos bases aťriennes ťloignťe.
Voir si on peut trouver un Raptor.
Ce n'est pas exactement
ce ŗ quoi je m'attendais.
Je pensais devoir enjamber
des corps en dťcomposition dans les rues.
Oui, on a vu quelques corps Áa et lŗ.
Pas beaucoup.
Sharon a dit...
Sharon le Cylon a dit
qu'ils avaient des troupes
pour ramasser les corps
pour les transporter
dans des incinťrateurs gťants.
Ta petite amie vient
d'une charmante famille.
Des gens biens avec de grandes valeurs.
«a suffit, ok†?
Oui j'ai ťtť trompť.
Elle m'a eu.
Tu es contente maintenant†?
Il ne s'agit pas
de me rendre heureuse.
Alors quoi†? Qu'est-ce que tu veux, lŗ†?
Tu veux que je te dise
que je suis un putain d'idiot†?
Je suis un putain d'idiot†!
Tu te sens mieux†?
Je n'en ai plus rien ŗ faire maintenant.
Je suis lŗ depuis des mois.
Seul, en fuite.
A deux pas des Cylons.
Avec des Cylons, je suppose, en fait.
Elle semblait tellement rťelle.
Comme Sharon, tu sais†?
MÍme sourire, mÍme rire.
Toutes les petites choses.
Je suis tombť amoureux d'une machine.
C'est stupide. Seulement...
traite-moi d'idiot et finissons en.
Tu es un idiot.
D'accord†? Tu es un idiot.
Mais les Cylons ont le chic
pour qu'on ait tous l'air idiot.
Kara, qu'est-ce que tu fais†?
Un arrÍt au stand.
Je dois rťcupťrer quelque chose.
On doit continuer.
J'ai un appart' ici, Helo.
Le virus cylon s'est propagť dans nos sous-
systŤmes avant qu'on ne coupe le rťseau.
Mes ťquipes nettoient chaque sous-systŤme
mais rťtablir le courant principal
prendra au moins 1 heure.
Capitaine†?
Nos marines se regroupent aux points
de contrŰle mais les com. sont brouillťes.
Oý sont les Cylons†?
On dirait qu'ils se sťparent en
deux groupes. Un avance...
L'autre recule.
Oui, monsieur.
J'ai dťjŗ vu Áa.
Voici leurs objectifs.
Le poste secondaire de
ContrŰle des Dťg‚ts, et...
le systŤme d'armement auxiliaire.
S'ils rťussissent, ils outrepasseront
nos sŻretťs de dťcompression.
et nous expťdieront tous dans l'espace.
Quand nous serons tous morts, ils pointeront
les canons du vaisseau contre la flotte.
et l'anťantiront
une bonne fois pour toutes.

je l'ai vu noyer notre bťbť.
Pourquoi quelqu'un voudrait-il
noyer un bťbť†?
Gaius, la rťponse est
tout autour de nous.
- Que s'est-il passť ici†?
- Le sacrifice humain.
Ce ne sont pas les contes de fťes auxquels
tes …critures voudraient te faire croire.
Je pensais que Kobol ťtait censť Ítre
un paradis ou quelque chose comme Áa.
Un...
endroit oý...
les humains et les Dieux
vivaient en harmonie.
Pour un temps peut Ítre.
Puis votre vraie nature s'est imposťe.
Votre brutalitť, votre dťpravation,
votre barbarie.
Alors les …critures ne sont
qu'un mensonge.
Juste un mensonge,
juste une couverture pour toute cette...
sauvagerie.
Exactement.
Tout ceci s'est dťjŗ produit
auparavant, Gaius.
Et Áa se produira encore.
Adama...
La vraie nature de l'humanitť
s'imposera toujours.
Donc il tentera de tuer notre bťbť.
Seulement si tu le laisses faire, Gaius
Seulement si tu le laisses faire.

Des Cylons partout.
TrŤs bien, calme-toi.

Six balles.
Nous sommes cinq.
Ok, bien...
Chacun en prends une.
Je prends la recharge.
Attendez, vous ne me comptez pas,

Je ne suis que matelot ici. Je ne

J'ignore tout du combat
contre des centurions.
Allez...
On y va.
C'est parti.
On n'a jamais ses clťs de maison
quand on en a besoin.
C'est de toi†?
T'as peint Áa, Kara†?
Ouais.
Dis-moi comment tu as de l'ťlectricitť.
Des batteries.
Ils n'arrÍtaient pas de couper l'ťlectricitť.
Une histoire de facture non payťe.
«a ne te ressemble vraiment pas.
C'est de mon pŤre.
Bon, on a un paquet de nouilles.
Tu crois pas aux ťpiceries†?
Tu sais, je n'ai jamais vraiment aimť
cet endroit de toute faÁon.
L'air conditionnť ne marche pas l'ťtť.
Le chauffage ne marche pas l'hiver.
Le loyer est criminel.
AprŤs leur attaque, je n'ai jamais...
Je n'ai jamais regrettť aucun

Oh, Dieux, Dee.

Oui, j'allais ŗ l'avant.
Par tous les Dieux, tu saignes.

Jai ťtť ici, dans le noir, longtemps.
C'est probablement une commotion.
Caporal Venner.
Nous avons besoin d'un autre itinťraire
vers l'infirmerie.
Donnez-moi vos yeux.
Regardez-moi.
Nous ne voulons pas aller
dans une fusillade.
Nous voulons aller loin des Cylons.
Alors ťclaircissez-vous les idťes.
Allez.
Nous pourrions passer par...
le long de la coursive tribord.
- C'est beaucoup plus long.
- Bien. Tribord, on y va†!
Le Lt Wallace dit que ses unitťs ont
dťtruit deux centurions ŗ cette jonction.
Ils en ont piťgť un troisiŤme
dans la buanderie.
Il ne peut plus marcher
mais il tire toujours.
Au moins la menace est limitťe
au systŤme d'armement auxiliaire.
Croyez-moi. Ils se dirigent toujours
vers le ContrŰle ArriŤre de Dťg‚ts arriŤre.
Lieutenant Gaeta†?
Le Sgt Hadrian dit que ses unitťs
ont dŻ s'arrÍter au pont dix.
A la section 69.
Ils entendent des bruits par la coque

Mouvement intelligent.
«a nous empÍche de les pourchasser.
Il n'y a rien entre
les deux derniers Cylons

C'est un idiot.
J'espŤre qu'il va bien.

Il est solide. Nous devons juste...
lui apporter le mťdikit.
On doit y aller, Cally.

Oý diable ťtiez-vous†?

Vous suivez mes ordres dans une

- Vous ne dites que "Oui monsieur†!"
- Oui monsieur†!
…coutez, Crashdown, je...
J'ai vraiment un mauvais

Il ne s'en sortira pas.

Qu'est-ce que Áa veut dire†?
On a le mťdikit, faites-lui une piqŻre.
Faites-lui une autre piqŻre†!
Trop tard.
Comment Áa c'est trop tard†?
Je vous ai apportť le mťdikit.
Que voulez-vous d'autre†?
On vous a apportť les mťdicaments

Tarn...
Pour quoi†?
Pour Áa†!
Allez, vous allez faire quelque chose.
Vous devez faire quelque chose.
Je ne peux pas changer
le fait qu'il va mourir, Chef.
«a sera lent et douloureux.
On peut lui ťpargner Áa.
On peut lui ťpargner Áa si on lui donne
la morphine de mon kit

Quoi†?
Non.

Lt., allez.
C'est votre homme, Chef.
Donnez-moi Áa. Donnez-moi Áa.

J'ťcoute les oiseaux.
Je, euh...
J'ai quelque chose contre la douleur.
Bonne nouvelle, mon pote.
Il y a une ťquipe de sauvetage ici.

Tu devrais mettre le cran de sŻretť.
D'accord.

Calme-toi maintenant, Jammer.
Oui, monsieur.
Je ne suis pas vraiment

Moi non plus.
Parfois, tu dois absolument
faire un double six.
Qu'est-ce que cela signifie, monsieur†?
Je ne sais pas.
C'est quelque chose que mon pŤre disait.
Juste... ne tirez pas avant
que je vous le dise.
D'accord.
Ok, on est en forme. Ils arrivent.
Mais on est en forme.
Tir ŗ la tÍte. Recharger.
Tir ŗ la tÍte.
Tir ŗ la tÍte. Recharger.
Tir ŗ la tÍte.
OK, ils arrivent.

Oui.

On a rťussi†!
On les a tous eu†!
Ils n'ont pas l'air si grand

Ils ont l'air assez grand comme Áa.
Je... Je vais prendre Áa.

Non, je ne pense pas.
Oui, je vais bien.
Les Dieux doivent veiller sur vous.
Marre de marcher†?
Merci.

Je croyais que tu avais dit...
Oublie ce que j'ai dit.
Et ťcoute ce que je te dis.
Tu m'ťcoutes†?
Je suis dťsolť. Je...
Je n'ai pas bien entendu.
Pourrais-tu...
Pourrais-tu faire Áa encore une fois†?
Soyons clairs.
Tire le rideau.
Le Docteur Cottle est en chemin.
Il sera lŗ d'une minute ŗ l'autre.
Il va se rťtablir.
Vous le savez.
Ouais.
Ouais, je le sais.
Colonel, je suppose qu'il y a toujours
une cellule qui m'attend lŗ-bas.
C'est exact.
Caporal Venner, je suis prÍte.
Je ne peux pas croire que vous soyez du
cŰtť de cette femme contre le patron.
Je n'aurais pas fait Áa si vous n'aviez pas
pointť une arme sur moi et vous l'avez fait†!
En ce qui me concerne, vous n'Ítes pas
digne de porter un uniforme.
Vous avez raison sur ce point.
Je ne suis pas digne
de porter un uniforme.
Peut-Ítre ne l'ai-je jamais ťtť.
Mais encore une fois, vous non plus.
Mais ce n'est pas mon vaisseau.
Et ce n'est certainement pas le vŰtre,
c'est le sien.
Et quand il se rťveillera...
Il dťcidera quoi faire de nous deux.
Louťs soient les Dieux,

LES CYLONS FURENT
CRÉÉS PAR L'HOMME
ILS ÉVOLUÈRENT
ILS SE RÉVOLTÈRENT
IL Y A DE NOMBREUSES COPIES
ET ILS ONT UN PLAN.
Précédemment dans
Battlestar Galactica...
Ce sera le commandement
d'Adama, jusqu'à sa mort.
Et nous n'allons pas
le laisser mourir.
Et pour nos hommes sur Kobol?
Si ils sont toujours en vie,
Ils vont devoir attendre.
Lt. ?
- Vérifions le matériel avant de filer.
- Nous n'avons pas le temps, Chef !
Je pourrais vous donner une dose,
mais vous n'aimeriez pas
les effets secondaires.
Faites-le.
Le temps viendra ou vous
ne pourrez plus le cacher...
Ses poumons se remplissent de fluide.
Il a besoin de sérosine ou il mourra.
Tarn.
Vous avez oublié le médikit, alors
vous allez y retourner pour le récupérer!
C'est trop tard.
Il ne tiendra pas...
Je suis désolé, Chef.
Seigneurs de Kobol,
Accueillez ces hommes braves
auprès de vous.
Accueillez les...
Accueillez sur...
Accueillez,
les esprits de nos amis tombés,
afin quils profitent
de la vie éternelle,
qui nous attend tous,
par delà la vallée des pleurs.
Ainsi soit-il.
Ainsi soit-il.
Rien ne les attend.
Ni vie éternelle, ni damnation.
Seulement l'oubli.
Parce qu'ils n'ont pas vu
le visage de Dieu, je sais.
Parce qu'ils sont morts ici.
Sur Kobol.
Je vois.
Doc...
Allons-y.
On bouge d'ici.
Doc,
vous m'entendez ?
On bouge d'ici.
Je vous ai bien entendu, Chef.
C'est juste que je ne réponds
pas au titre de "Doc".
Un dock, c'est une plate-forme
pour charger et décharger du matériel.
Mon titre est "Docteur"
ou "M. le vice président",
si ça ne vous dérange pas.
Vous êtes bien en train
de charger du matériel, non ?
Lieutenant ?
Lt. !
Crash !
Oui Chef, j'arrive.
Pas de Cylon.
Vous êtes sûr ?
Attendez un peu.
La lisière, à 2 heures.
Je les ai. Que font-ils ?
On dirait qu'ils
démontent le vaisseau.
Pourquoi ne pas l'utiliser
pour se casser d'ici ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je ne pourrais dire...
Ils l'emmènent dans la forêt.
C'est... Attendez un peu.
Ils construisent quelque chose.
Chef, est-ce un...
Un missile.
Ils construisent une
batterie de missiles.
Au moins nous savons pourquoi
ils ne nous cherchent pas.
Pourquoi ?
- Pourquoi ils ne nous cherchent pas ?
- Parce qu'ils n'en ont pas besoin.
Ils n'ont quà attendre,
et faire un tir de barrage
qui détruira toute vie dans cette vallée.
La prochaine fois que je suis pressé,
ouvrez le sas plus vite !
C'est votre premier jour ?
Dr, Dieux merci vous êtes là.
La présidente a besoin de vous.
- Poussez-vous !
- Doc...
Docteur!
Ok...
Faites-moi un bilan,
immédiatement.
2 balles, 9mm. Celle-ci s'est logée
dans la rate, l'autre a entaillé l'aorte.
Nous lui avons retiré la rate,
- et nous pensions avoir soigné l'aorte
- Depuis peu la tension rechute à 80/40.
Et son rythme cardiaque
est remonté à 130.
Vous avez loupé quelque chose,
il reste une hémorragie quelque part.
On va le perdre à moins que
nous arrêtions ce saignement.
Donnez moi un A.B.G,
un C.B.C. et des coagulants,
Et préparez-vous pour
une intubation en urgence.
- Il va s'en sortir ?
- Comment le saurais-je ?
Je ne suis pas voyant,
maintenant, dégagez d'ici !

Donne moi un MAC de 3,7.

J'ai dit MAC de 3,7 !
Je suis désolé.
Clampez.

Sa tension chute.
Elle est à 60/30.
Son rythme cardiaque s'effondre.
Je ne pense pas
qu'il tiendra longtemps.
Restez concentrée. Aspirez d'avantage
que je vois ce que je fais.
Colonel...
- Comment va le Commandant ?
- Quoi ?
- Comment va le Commandant ?
- Toujours au bloc.
Qu'avez-vous en tête ?
J'ai besoin de médicaments
pour la Présidente.
Elle n'est plus la Présidente.
Cottle est un peu occupé
pour le moment.
- Elle souffre vraim--
- Pourquoi n'êtes-vous pas en cellule ?
Parce que...
personne ne m'y a mis ?
C'est quoi tout ce bordel ?
Pourquoi vous n'êtes pas en cellule ?
Je suis en service, monsieur.
- Je planifie la mission de sauvetage.
- Une mission de sauvetage ?
Pour qui ?
On perd un vaisseau
et personne ne me le dit ?!
Pour l'équipage du Raptor,
écrasé sur Kobol, monsieur?
Simes est un pilote confirmé,
maintenant. Il peut s'en occuper.
Vous m'avez dit de commander l'escadre
pendant mon service, et je suis en service.
Donc, est-ce que je commande...
ou non ?
Quel est le statut de la mission,
Capitaine?
Nous ne savons pas dans quelle zone
le Raptor 3 est tombé.
Donc la seule chance de le trouver
est d'espérer que...
leur balise de secours
fonctionne toujours.
Je compte prendre 2 Raptors, dont un
avec une équipe médicale, et faire...
- Cinq révolutions orbitales basses.
- Que faîtes-vous du Vaisseau-mère Cylon
que le Lt Valerii a soit disant détruit ?
Et si elle avait menti ?
Racetrack a confirmé la destruction
du Vaisseau-mère, et j'ai vérifié
la vidéo des canons du Raptor
qui le confirme.
Lt. Gaeta, pourquoi tournez-vous en rond ?
- C'est la presse...
- La presse ?
Ils exigent de savoir combien de temps
nous comptons les retenir et quand...
- ils pourront contacter leurs vaisseaux.
- Ils exigent ?
Ils ne sont pas en position
d'exiger quoi que ce soit.
Dites-leur d'arrêter de piailler.
on s'occupera d'eux en temps voulu.
Excusez-moi, Colonel.
Une navette venant du Zéphyr
demande l'autorisation de se poser.
Le Zéphyr ?
Apparemment le Conseil des Douze
est à bord. Ils exigent de vous voir.
Ils exigent ?
Métier d'exigence que de
commander un Battlestar...
Autorisez-les à se poser.
Retenez-les dans le carré des officiers
jusqu'à ce que je puisse les voir.
- Madame la Présidente ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'elle a ?
Je ne sais pas, mais elle est malade.
Vous le voyez bien, non ?
Est-ce que je peux
faire quelque chose ?
- Madame la Présidente...
- Oui ?
Puis-je vous procurer quelque chose
tant que vous êtes en cellule ?
Billy ?
Non, merci.
Je suis désolée.
J'éprouve des...
difficultés à penser.
C'est le manque.
- Le chamalla ?
- Oui.
- Je vais essayer de vous en procurer plus.
- Faites vite.
Je vois,
six missiles transportés
sur ce site jusqu'à maintenant.
Tout ça ne rime à rien...
On les abat.
Et ils nous descendent.
Donc on en tue encore plus.
Donc ils tuent plus des nôtres.
- A quoi bon maintenant ?
- Toi et ta...
race avez inventé le meurtre.
Tuer pour le sport,
par avidité, par envie...
C'est la seule véritable
forme d'art de l'humanité
Vous avez commis quelques
meurtres aussi, il me semble.
Oui, nous sommes vos enfants.
Vous nous avez bien appris.
Pourquoi Dieu apporterait-il un enfant
dans ce genre de monde de toute façon ?
Parce que en définitive
et malgré tout,
Il désire toujours vous offrir le salut.
Notre enfant amènera le salut, mais
seulement si tu acceptes ton rôle de père.
Et de protecteur.
Je ne suis pas prêt pour ça, ok ?
Je ne suis pas un père.
Je ne suis pas un protecteur.
Je ne suis pas une autorité morale,
capable de guider quelqu'un.
Encore moins un bébé.
Sois un homme, Gaius.
Quoi ?
Sois un homme.
Quoi que tu sois d'autre,
tu es au moins ça.
Le moment approche où
tu devra agir comme tel.
- Attendez une minute. Lt, regardez ça.
- Qu'est-ce que vous voyez, chef ?
A 45° Est.
de la rampe de lancement.
Vous voyez la souche d'arbre ?
Qu'est-ce que ça peut bien être ?
On dirait une parabole dradis.
Du moins la version cylon
d'une parabole dradis.
Probablement récupérée
du nez du vaisseau.
Ils construisent une DCA.
Une DCA ?
Pourquoi ? Il n'y a pas
d'autres vaisseaux par ici.
Le Galactica enverra une mission
de sauvetage. Quand ils viendront...
Ce sera au moins 2 Raptors,
en rase-mottes au dessus du crash.
Quand ces Raptors
viendront nous chercher,
- risquant leur vie pour nous sauver...
- Les Cylons les abattront.
7 chasseurs à quai pour réparations.
3 en service dans la CAP.
Les relevés de communication.
Les messages prioritaires sont au-dessus.
Abrégez. Capitaine,
dans combien de temps
lancerez-vous la mission ?
- Enfin Dee, ils sont tous prioritaires.
- Pardon, ils sont arrivés comme ça.
Je démonte le 305
pour en utiliser les pièces.
On devrait être parti dans,
je ne sais pas...
- 90 minutes.
- 90 minutes !
On a des hommes sur
cette putain de planète !
Mettez votre cervelle en route.
Faites votre boulot ou
retournez en cellule.
Tous les membres du Conseil,
sont au carré des officiers ?
Les douze, Monsieur.
Je suppose que vous ne
voulez pas le faire à ma place ?
Parler en public
n'a jamais été mon truc.
- Que fait-on ici ?
- Que se passe-t-il exactement ?
Laura Roslin a fomenté une mutinerie
et une sédition sur ce vaisseau.
Elle a causé la perte d'un atout
militaire majeur à un moment critique !
Le commandant à estimé
n'avoir d'autre choix
que de la destituer.
Vous l'avez déjà dit, plusieurs fois.
Vous semblez ne pas écouter, Col.
Peut importe ce qu'estimait Adama,
- Il n'avait absolument aucune autorité...
- Adama savait exactement ce qu'il faisait.
Il ouvrait la voie à la loi martiale
et à une dictature militaire.
N'est ce pas, Colonel ?
Je ne peux pas parler
pour le commandant.
Il est toujours au bloc.
Il semble que ce soit vous
qui donniez les ordres ici.
Donc, en détails
que comptez-vous faire ?
- Allez-vous déclarer la loi martiale ?
- Sûrement pas.
Je tiens pour acquis que le patron
haïssait au plus haut point la loi martiale.
Il croyait en la liberté, la démocratie
et toutes ces jolies choses.
Puisque nous avons encore,
une démocratie,
et toutes ces jolies choses,
Je propose que le Conseil exige
l'accès immédiat à la Présidente Roslin.
Excellent. Mention soutenue.
Ceux qui sont pour.
Pour.
Pour.
Mention adoptée.
Colonel, nous exigeons
l'accès immédiat à la présidente.
Je vais prendre
votre "exigence",
en considération.
Mme la Présidente.
Et quelque soit la chose
empêchant cette compréhension.
Mme la présidente.
- Je dois envisager...
- Laura
Laura ?
Bonjour.
Salut.
Vous allez bien ?
Je suis juste descendue
voir si je pouvais faire
quelque chose pour vous.
Rien que je puisse vous apporter ?
J'aimerais avoir une conversation
avec mon avocat.
Pouvez-vous arranger cela ?
Oui. C'est cela, bien sur.
Laura, vous savez où vous êtes ?
Je suis en prison.
Quel est mon nom ?
On s'est déjà rencontré ?
Je...
Je suis désolée.
Je m'excuse.
C'est juste...
cette sonnerie.
Excusez-moi.
Une sonnerie ?
Bien.
Bon et bien,
portez-vous bien.
Par tous les Dieux.
Ellen... Tigh.
Ellen ?
Ellen...
Seigneurs de Kobol...
Le lanceur a l'air d'un simple
viser-tirer. Pas de guidage intégré.
L'artillerie a l'air faite de missiles
vaisseau-vaisseau standards.
Ils les modifient pour le vol
en atmosphère.
Un centurion cylon
parcourt le périmètre,
et s'arrête à intervalles réguliers.
La parabole dradis
qui contrôle les missiles
a une longueur d'ondes de 4,5 kHz
à en juger par le diamètre.
Elle est gardée par
deux centurions, je pense.
Désolé Doc, vous avez dit
gardée par deux centurions ?
Oui, c'est ça.
Ok, le dradis est-il gardé
en permanence ou par intermittence ?
J'ai vu deux centurions
dans mes jumelles...
en permanence, pendant 5 minutes.
Tout ce temps là,
ils n'ont pas quitté leur poste.
Donc il y a 3 toasteurs
près du lanceur.
Deux de plus à la parabole.
Ça fait beaucoup de Cylons.
Vous avez déjà tenu une arme ?
Qui, moi ?
Non...
Je ne suis pas soldat, Crashdown.
Je vous donnerai la tâche la plus simple,
mais j'aurai besoin de chacun.
Vous ne suggérez pas
d'attaquer les Cylons ?
Nous devons descendre
ces enculés pour Socinus et Tarn
avant qu'ils ne tuent
quelqu'un d'autre.
Nous sommes à nombre égal.
Nous avons l'effet de surprise.
Donc nous avons l'avantage, et
on peut choisir le lieux et le moment.
Lt, un mot... en privé.
Il est dingue.
Je ne suis pas entraîné
pour ce genre de choses.
- Je n'ai jamais tiré de ma vie.
- Je n'ai pas tiré depuis mes classes.
Vous ?
Je me suis engagée pour
payer l'école de dentiste.
L'assaut terrestre élémentaire,
c'était il y a longtemps.
Pour nous tous.
C'est pas des instructeurs là-bas,
mais des machines à tuer.
On n'a pas le choix.
Le Galactica va envoyer
l'équipe de secours. C'est une question de
temps et si on ne détruit pas ce lanceur...
On ne peut pas attaquer
une position aussi bien défendue.
- Ils vont nous exploser en 2 minutes.
- Ça suffit !
Chef, en de telles circonstances,
c'est important que vous restiez calme.
- Je ne crois pas avoir perdu mon calme.
- Je ne suis pas d'accord.
Écoutez,
moi non plus je ne veux pas attaquer
ce lanceur, mais c'est notre devoir.
Nous le devons à l'équipe de secours,
ainsi qu'à Socinus et Tarn.
Je ne vois pas ce que cela a
à voir avec Socinus et Tarn.
C'est peut-être pour ça
que je suis officier et pas vous.
Rompez.
Ce briefing va résumer un plan
d'attaque en 5 paragraphes.
Paragraphe 1 : Situation.
Notre situation est que
nous sommes coincés sur Kobol
avec un groupe de 5 Cylons
voulant utiliser une DCA
pour détruire tout vaisseau
nous recherchant.
Aucun autre allié sur place.
C'est quoi ce truc de paragraphes ?
C'est un ordre en 5 paragraphes.
Technique de commandement élémentaire.
Enseigné en école d'officier.
D'habitude, ce n'est pas utilisé aussi...
...littéralement, sur le terrain.
Paragraphe 4 : Exécution.
Nous attaquerons le lanceur cylon
par le Nord-Ouest...
Arrêtez un peu...
C'est absurde.
Quoi, on s'attaque à
l'armée cylon, c'est ça ?
Nous ?
Regardez-nous.
Avec quoi, deux fusils et une gourde ?
vous avez perdu l'esprit ?
- Ça suffit, docteur.
- Ah oui ?!
Sauf votre respect, pourquoi
cherchons-nous toujours la difficulté ?
Personne d'autre ne pense que
ce plan est complètement cinglé ?
Je vais vous dire ce qui est juste.
- On vote à main levée...
- Non ! Certainement pas !
On n'est pas en démocratie !
Le Lt. commande !
Le Lt. commande.
Pas de si, pas de et, pas de mais.
Il dit on y va, on y va.
Pas de questions...
On a déjà perdu 2 hommes, Chef !
Combien de personnes allons-nous perdre ?
Vous allez vous asseoir
- et la fermer maintenant.
- Personne ne me dit de la fermer,
- je suis le vice-président...
- Asseyez-vous et fermez-la tout de suite.
Votre briefing, Lt.
Merci, Chef.
Paragraphe 4 :
Nous approcherons le lanceur cylon
par le Nord-Ouest en utilisant...
le terrain pour masquer
notre approche.
Notre objectif
est la console de contrôle.
Une fois cette position atteinte,
Cally, vous allez contourner
par la gauche,
faisant diversion
pour les Cylons,
ce qui, espérons-le, attirera leur feu
assez longtemps pour que Seelix et moi
contournions sur la droite
et puissions tirer sur la console.
Tyrol, vous et...
le vice-président
resterez en position une.
et assurerez le tir de couverture
pour les deux débordements.
On m'a donné l'opportunité de percevoir
les Écritures plus clairement.
Tout ce qui entrave cela...
je dois le considérer comme contraire
à la survie de l'espèce humaine.
Je crois...
C'est ridicule.
Regardez,
elle a besoin de ses médicaments.
J'essaie de le dire à qui veut l'entendre...
On dirait qu'elle parle des rouleaux
de la prophète Pythie.
Je suppose...
La Pythie a prédit la venue d'un leader.
Un leader qui guiderait
toute l'humanité vers son salut.
Ainsi parlèrent les Dieux.
Vous semblez en savoir long
sur les Écritures.
Je viens de Geminon.
Nous croyons à une vérité
littérale des Ecritures
Caporal Venner ?
Il y a...
une drogue que les prêtres
utilisent parfois.
Ça s'appelle l'extrait de Chamalla.
- C'est "l'happy hour" j'imagine.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a de réjouissant ?
Le patron est encore en chirurgie.
Et j'ai une cargaison de politiciens
et de journalistes
exigeant de voir Laura Roslin.
- Autorise-les.
- Ouais, c'est ça.
- Elle est folle.
- Je sais.
Non, non. Vraiment, Saul.
Elle a craqué.
Je suis descendue
la voir en cellule.
Tu as fait ça ?
Elle est...
complètement tarée.
Elle ne sait même plus où elle est.
- Tu plaisantes.
- Tu devrais les laisser la voir.
La presse, le Conseil.
Tous.
Laisse les dire que...
la petite institutrice a dit
bye-bye à la raison, et que...
le vice-président est
porté disparu ou mort.
Ça te laisse le commandement
incontesté de ce vaisseau.
Et de la flotte.
Seulement jusqu'à ce que
le patron soit sur pied.
Bon,
bien sûr.
<i>Galactica, ici Apollo,
nous nous préparons à sauter vers Kobol.
Bien compris, Apollo.
Vous êtes autorisé à sauter.
- Bonne chasse.
- Merci, Galactica.
Allons chercher les nôtres.
Ok, armer le fusil,
enlever la sûreté, ouvrir le viseur.
Ok, armer le fusil,
enlever la sûreté, ouvrir le viseur.
L'un de vous se retournera
contre les autres.
Pendant la mission ?
Oui.
- Un de nous trahira les autres ?
- Oui.
- Pendant l'attaque ?
- Oui.
Mais si l'attaque échoue ?
Vous mourrez.
Pas moi.
Je suis l'instrument de Dieu.
Dieu s'est détourné de Kobol.
Détourné de l'Homme
et des faux dieux qu'il a vénérés.
Ce qui se passe sur Kobol
n'est pas sa volonté.
En selle.
C'est l'heure de
flinguer du toasteur.
XO.
<i>Ici le CIC, Dualla, M.</i>
<i>Le Conseil exige de voir
l'ex-présidente.</i>
Ils sont assez intraitables et
posent problème aux sentinelles.
On peut peut-être leur dire de
se mettre leur exigence au cul.
Qu'est-ce que vous en dites ?
Oui, Monsieur. J'ai besoin
d'instructions pour les sentinelles.
<i>Ils demandent comment réagir.</i>
Dites-leur qu'ils vont pouvoir voir
ce qu'est devenue leur
précieuse présidente.
Dites-leur ça.
J'ai un signal de transpondeur.
Indéniablement colonial.
J'essaie d'établir la position.
Je l'ai.
Hémisphère nord.
Le terrain a l'air montagneux.
Il y a une vallée.
Faites-nous sortir d'orbite.
Indiquez au Raptor Deux
de s'aligner sur nous.
Les voilà.
Tous les trois,
exactement où ils devaient être.
Allez, c'est le moment.
On attaque.
Cally, allez en lisière des arbres
au point Alpha.
Lt., il y a cinq Cylons
sur le site de lancement.
Quoi ?
Quelque chose ne va pas ?
Un problème avec le plan ?
Du calme, tout va bien.
Juste deux Cylons qu'on
n'avait pas compté. Ce qui fait...
sept Cylons.
Cinq ici, et deux sous la parabole.
Vous êtes absolument sûr pour
les deux gardes à la parabole ?
Je sais ce que j'ai vu.
Peut-être n'y a-t-il que cinq Cylons.
Ils ont juste changé leur position.
Les deux qui gardaient
la parabole sont venus ici.
La parabole n'est plus protégée.
Dieux, Chef, cette parabole
est presque à un click d'ici.
Et alors ?
Elle est sans défense. On peut se la faire.
On n'a pas à attaquer toute l'armée cylon.
Qu'est-ce que c'était ?
Bang supersonique.
Un vaisseau entrant dans l'atmosphère.
C'est la mission de sauvetage.
Ils sont là. Ils sont juste là.
On doit y aller.
Pas le temps de discuter.
Bon, tout le monde, action.
Il est temps.
On descend ces toasteurs avant
qu'ils ne tuent quelqu'un.
- Cally, j'ai dit "action".
- Je ne peux pas.
Quoi ? C'est un ordre.
Elle n'est pas obligée.
On peut juste aller bousiller la parabole.
Cally, vous devez bouger.
Cally, ce n'est pas une blague.
Allez. Ce n'est pas un jeu, Cally.
Des gens comptent sur nous.
Ils sont là haut, Cally. Bougez !
Écoutez-moi. On peut encore faire
demi-tour et détruire la parabole.
Fermez-la une seconde.
Cally, Cally. Technicien !
Vous avez vos ordres. Vous devez
faire diversion, maintenant !
- Bougez !
- Lt.
Il devait y avoir trois Cylons
et maintenant ils sont cinq.
Comment pourrait-on
descendre cinq Cylons ?
Je me fous des ordres
et de la cour martiale.
Nos hommes sont là-haut. On doit les
sauver. On n'a pas le temps. Bougez !
- Je ne peux pas le faire.
- J'ai dit bougez !
Chef !
Posez ça. Posez ça.
Tu vas y aller, Cally.
Tu vas y aller ou je t'explose
le cerveau. Ici et maintenant.
Posez ça.
Lt., calme, on se calme.
Je compte jusqu'à trois.
C'est de la folie. C'est de la folie !
Un.
- Posez ça, maintenant.
- Par tous les Dieux.
Écoutez-moi !
Lâchez votre arme.
Deux.
Trois.
Repli ! Repli ! Allez !
Allez, doc, on y va !
Maintenant tu es un homme.
- Estimation du temps d'arrivée ?
- Cinq minutes !
Cally, venez, vite.
Doc ! Donnez-moi
le lance-grenades !
Donnez-moi le
lance-grenades, Doc. Vite !
Missiles ! Y'a une batterie en bas !
Esquive ! Décroche, décroche !
Pas de verrouillage.
Ils ne sont pas verrouillés sur nous.
Chef !
Restez là !
Chef ! Chef !
Il n'y à pas de quoi.
C'est l'heure de la visite au zoo.
Heureux de voir votre grande
estime pour la présidente.
Ton tour viendra, petit rigolo.
Allons-y.
Je ne comprends pas
pourquoi elle ne dit rien.
Je ne sais pas quoi faire.
C'est bon, le spectacle est fini.
Laissons la tranquille.
Tout le monde dehors.
Retournons au carré des officiers et
nous verrons comment on s'arrange.
Merci à tous d'être venu.
J'ai une annonce à faire.
La tentative de coup d'état contre
le gouvernement légitime des Colonies
est illégal, injustifié
et clairement voué à l'échec.
Je n'ai pas renoncé à la présidence
et je ferais tout ce qui est en mon
pouvoir pour combattre ces agissements.
Elle est folle, elle est tarée.
Elle pense être un prophète
ou ce genre d'absurdité.
Allez-y, demandez lui,
elle vous dira. Écoutez-la.
C'était quoi déjà ?
La flèche d'Apollo...
ouvrira la Tombe d'Artémis,
un délire de ce genre.
Tout ce que j'ai fait était cohérent et
logique. Nous avons trouvé Kobol,
nous avons trouvé
la Cité des Dieux,
et quand nous récupèrerons la flèche
nous ouvrirons la tombe d'Athéna
et trouverons la voie vers la Terre.
Mme la Présidente, avez-vous
lu les Parchemins de la Pythie ?
Avec attention et plusieurs fois,
et je pense humblement
remplir le rôle du leader.
Ok, assez d'absurdités,
tout le monde dégage.
Attendez une minute !
Sarah, vous représentez Geminon. Vous en
savez plus sur les Parchemins et Ecritures
que nul autre ici,
pourquoi ne parlez-vous pas ?
Les Parchemins nous disent qu'un leader
mourant nous conduira au salut.
Elle n'est pas mourante.
Elle est folle.
Je suis mourante.
J'ai un cancer du sein en stade terminal.
Dr. Cottle confirmera le diagnostic.
Il me reste quelques mois à vivre.
Et durant ce temps,
je vous conduirai au salut.
C'est mon seul but.
Loués soient les Dieux.
Voici notre salut.
Sergent de la garde,
virez ces gens des cellules
et escortez-les à leur navette.
Merci, Caporal.
Remerciez les Dieux.
Quelle putain de boucherie, Chef.
Comment Crashdown est mort ?
En menant l'attaque.
Il a donné sa vie...
dans la plus noble
tradition militaire.
C'était un héros, jusqu'au bout.
Je suis si fière de toi Gaius.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que j'ai pris une vie ?
C'est ce qui vous rend humain.
Vraiment ?
Pas la pensée consciente ?
Ni la poésie, ou...
l'art, la musique,
la littérature ?
Le meurtre.
Le meurtre est mon héritage.
C'est la leçon que je suis
censé donner à notre enfant ?
Tout ira bien, Gaius.
Hey, Docteur, on y va !
Docteur, venez !
Faut qu'on y aille.
Je serai ta conscience.
Allez Doc !
On doit dégager d'ici !
Il vivra.
Quand se réveillera-t-il ?
Le connaissant, quand il
l'aura décidé, probablement.
J'ai vraiment tout fait foirer, Bill.
Les évènements qui se sont produits
à bord du Colonial One sont regrettables.
Les actions de mutinerie et de sédition
parmi l'armée par Laura Roslin
ne peuvent être tolérées.
Ainsi le Cdt Adama n'a
pas eu d'autre choix
que de la démettre de ses fonctions.
Mlle Roslin se repose maintenant
confortablement à bord de ce vaisseau
où elle restera jusqu'à ce que
le Commandant en décide autrement.
Il devient évident que le gouvernement
ne peut fonctionner en ces circonstances,
j'ai décidé de dissoudre
le Conseil des Douze.
A compter de cet instant,
je déclare la loi martiale.
- Virez-moi ces gens de mon vaisseau.
- Oui Monsieur.

ET ILS ONT UN PLAN.
Précédemment, dans Battlestar Galactica.
Félicitations, Docteur,
vous venez de découvrir
votre tout premier Cylon.
Je ne suis pas un Cylon.
Ce n'est pas possible.
Ça fait des mois que
je traine ici, seul,
en fuite,
ŕ deux pas des Cylons.
Tu vas obéir, ou je vais
t'exploser la cervelle !
Ici męme,
et maintenant.
Comment Crashdown est-il mort ?
Il s'est sacrifié selon la
plus noble tradition militaire.
Vous avez ma parole.
Quand je serai en service,
je ne tenterai pas de la libérer,
ou de fomenter une insurrection...
Quand je ne serai pas en service, je
retournerai directement dans ma cellule.
Je n'ai que
quelques mois ŕ vivre.
Et d'ici lŕ...
Je guiderai ce peuple vers son salut.
C'est mon unique but.
Etant évident
que le gouvernement ne peut
fonctionner dans ces circonstances.
J'ai décidé de dissoudre
le Conseil des Douze.
Et ŕ compter de ce jour,
je déclare...
la loi martiale.
Vous transpirez.
- Il fait chaud ici.
- Depuis quand savez-vous...
que le Lieutenant Valerii comptait
assassiner le Commandant Adama ?
Je n'avais aucune idée qu'elle
allait commettre un tel acte.
Vous la sautiez.
- Fini depuis des semaines, sur vos ordres.
- Vous la couvriez, vous mentiez pour elle.
Jadmets... avoir manqué de bon sens.
Vous l'avez protégé
pour chaque méfait.
Colonel, je n'avais aucune idée
que c'était un Cylon.
Je voudrais utiliser mes droits
en vertu de l'article 21.
J'en suis sűr.
Vous n'avez pas entendu.
Les Cylons n'ont aucun droit.
- Cylons ? Attendez un peu !
- Vous savez ce que l'on fait aux Cylons ?
Je ne suis pas un Cylon !
Roslin a proposé une méthode
d'exécution.
- Je suis Galen Tyrol !
- Elle a éjecté un Cylon...
Ŕ travers le sas, dans l'espace.
Mon pčre était un prętre !
Et ma mčre un Oracle.
Je sers sur des Battlestars
depuis que j'ai 18 ans.
Le Pegasus, Colombia,
Atlantia, Galactica...
Ne me parlez pas
comme si vous étiez un soldat !
Vous n'ętes PAS un soldat !
Le patron a toujours eu
un faible pour vous.
- Laissons-le décider de votre sort.
- Colonel, vous devez me croire.
Je ne suis pas un Cylon.
Je ne ferais jamais rien contre Adama.
J'aime le patron.
C'est ce que disait votre petite amie.
Foutez-le dehors !
Chef ?
Je croyais que tu étais sur Kobol.
Ne...
me... parle pas.
Ne m'approche pas.
Ne me touche pas.
Sinon, je jure...
que je te tuerai !

- Aucun signe de centurion dans le coin.
- J'aime pas ça.

Deux Cylons ne roulent pas jusqu'ici
en plein jour pour le plaisir.
Pas aprčs l'attaque
du convoi la semaine derničre.
Tu l'as dit, putain !
Ok, on les explose.
Fais passer le message,
que tout le monde se tienne pręt.
Je veux exploser ces Cylons
avant męme qu'ils sachent comment !
On doit trouver oů on peut bien ętre.
Pourquoi ?
Tu ne le sais pas ?
- C'était toi le copilote.
- Et c'était toi qui conduisais.

Ok, on peut se diriger
vers Cobb's Point.
Il y a une piste d'atterrissage

J'ai...
Je me disais qu'on pourrait
prendre au sud-ouest. Vers...
T'as entendu ça ?
- Tu roules souvent dans les mauvais quartiers ?
- Mieux vaut assurer que regretter.
Comme tu dis.
- On est des cibles de foire ici !
- Vas-y, je te couvre !
- Pourquoi moi ?
- Commence pas.
Bien !
- Pręte ?
- Oui.
Vas-y !
Ils sont 5, dispersés
entre 9 et 1 heure. 50 mčtres.
Pręt ?
Vas-y !
Je n'ai rien vu de brillant
ou d'argenté lŕ-bas.
Je crois que nous avons affaire
ŕ la version "humaine".
Je l'espčre... ils ne sont pas
aussi résistants que les mécaniques.
Oui.
Par contre ils saignent bien.
Ça devrait te plaire.
Tirons-nous d'ici ! Viens !
Ils ont enfermé le chef avec Boomer.
Tigh pense que c'est un Cylon.
Je sais.
Je vais voir le Colonel maintenant.
Je crois qu'il veut que je trouve
un moyen d'innocenter le Chef. Ou bien...
Ou quoi ?
Il va le jeter dans l'espace,
comme un vulgaire déchet !
Si le commandant Adama était lŕ,
ça n'arriverait pas.
Oui, mais il n'est pas lŕ.
Mais je connais le Chef depuis des années.
Ce n'est pas un toaster.
Il fréquentait le Lieutenant Valerii,
qui est, pour sűr, un toaster.
C'est un terme raciste.
Je ne l'aime pas.
Bien sűr...
Il a fait preuve d'un bien mauvais
jugement en sortant avec elle.
Mais ça ne veut pas
dire qu'il soit un toaster.
Vous devez l'aider.
Dis quelque chose, Gaius.
Dis-lui que tu ne veux pas entendre
ce type de commentaires racistes.
Je suis désolé. J'allais dire
au Colonel que je ne peux rien faire.
Le détecteur cylon
que j'ai créé ne marche pas.
A l'évidence.
Non !
Vous devez l'aider.
Ton enfant sera ŕ moitié toaster.
Qu'est ce que ça te fait ?
Rien ne me ferait plus plaisir.
Seulement je ne sais pas
ce que je pourrais dire.
- Excusez-moi.
- Il vous a aidé !
Il n'a dit ŕ personne
ce que vous avez fait sur Kobol.
Ce que vous avez fait ŕ Crashdown.
Ce que j'ai fait ŕ Crashdown
vous a sauvé la vie.
Serait-ce un chantage ?
Aidez le Chef
et vous vous aiderez, Docteur.
Oui, Docteur.
C'est ce que tu fais de mieux, pas vrai ?
Rapport d'Appontages.
Quel est donc le problčme avec
votre détecteur ŕ cylons, Docteur ?
- Vous avez laissé passer l'assassin.
- Mais ce n'était qu'un béta test,
un test préliminaire.
Manifestement, ma méthode n'était pas
parfaite, et elle est passée au travers.
Qu'est-ce que vous me racontez lŕ ?
Qu'on doit repartir du début ?
Qu'il n'y a pas de résultats définitifs ?
Quon na aucun moyen de savoir
qui sont les Cylons parmi nous ?
Non, je dis que depuis que le test de
Valerii... Depuis le test de l'assassin,
J'ai développé de nouveaux protocoles
qui devraient éliminer les erreurs...
les anomalies qui sont survenues plus tôt.
Si je peux tester le Chef,
je pourrai dire une fois pour toute si...
Pas de "si", je veux une réponse définitive.
Assez de votre blabla technique ambigu.
C'est un Cylon ou pas.
Alors allez lŕ-bas et faites
quelque chose correctement pour changer.
Je suis le Vice-président.
Légalement, si la Présidente n'est
pas apte, ne devrais-je pas
- prendre sa place ?
- Légalement,
j'ai déclaré la loi martiale.
Vous n'ętes plus personne.
Donc...
sauf si vous voulez rejoindre
Roslin en cellule,
je vous suggčre de
vous mettre au boulot.
C'est un plaisir de vous voir, Colonel.
N'es-tu pas fatigué de
cette humiliation constante ?
L'irrespect des mécanos
comme des colonels ?
A ton avis ?
Peut-ętre qu'il est temps
de faire quelque chose.
- Monsieur.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Les capitaines de la flotte rapportent
des plaintes des civils.
Manifestations, pétitions, et męme
quelques cas de désobéissance.
Tous ŕ propos de la déclaration
de loi martiale.
Il y a autre chose.
Le vaisseau-raffinerie Aturian a arręté
de raffiner le Tylium. Ils disent que
- s'ils n'ont pas de voix au gouvernement...
- Quoi ?!
Leurs capitaines disent qu'ils enverront du
carburant une fois le gouvernement restauré.
Et trois autres vaisseaux refusent également
de réapprovisionner le Galactica
jusqu'au retour de la Présidente.
Et j'ai un mémo du CIC
qui nous avertit de problčmes
d'approvisionnement en Tylium.
Alors surveillez votre consommation de
carburant jusqu'ŕ nouvel ordre. Questions ?
Ouais, quand est-ce que vous
revenez jouer aux cartes ?
Quand je ne suis pas de service,
je crains de devoir jouir du cadre
intimiste des cellules jusqu'ŕ...
et bien,
jusqu'ŕ nouvel ordre.
- Revenez. Vous nous manquez, Capitaine.
- On peut vous apporter les cartes.
Je doute que le Col. Tigh approuve.
- Allez, y'a une partie demain soir !
- Ok, ok.
Ça suffit !
- Bonjour, Monsieur.
- Sergent.
On y va ?
Bonjour, Monsieur.
- Bonjour. Qui aurait cru vous croiser ici.
- Je passais juste par lŕ monsieur.
- Salut les gars.
- Ça va, Dee ?
Bien, merci.
Comment va mon pčre aujourd'hui ?
Toujours pareil, Capitaine.
Il est sous sédatif et se repose
confortablement depuis l'opération.
- Des problčmes se trament dans la flotte.
- Oh, étonnant.
- Quel genre de problčmes ?
- La loi martiale n'est pas bien accueillie.
Protestations, manifestations...
Des vaisseaux refusent męme
d'approvisionner le Galactica.
Et ce n'est que le début. Imaginez
si c'était une dictature.
Je préfčrerais...
Je préfčrerais que vous soyez
aux commandes, Monsieur.
- Dee...
- Il s'est remis ŕ picoler.
Beaucoup.
Merci pour la compagnie,
second maître Dualla.
Je vous en prie, Monsieur.
- Ça va chéri ?
- Non, ça va pas.
On dirait que ma tęte va
me tomber des épaules.
- Tu travailles sur quoi ?
- J'essaie de trouver comment résoudre
notre problčme d'approvisionnement,
maintenant que la moitié
de la flotte s'est mise en grčve.
- T'es sérieux ?
- Oui, je suis sérieux.
Je devrais probablement convoquer
une assemblée avec tous les capitaines
et leur expliquer la situation
et leur dire pourquoi
j'ai dű déclarer la loi martiale.
On les emmerde.
Comme si t'avais ŕ t'expliquer.
Ça ferait pas de mal.
Ça calmerait un peu la situation.
Quoi ?
Rien.
Non, non, c'est...
c'est toi le patron.
Loin de moi l'idée de te dire
comment faire ton boulot
- Je sais que c'est ton problčme.
- Vas-y dis le.
Je sais pas, ça fait un peu...
démonstratif.
Tu sais, "Asseyons-nous tous et parlons
de vos sentiments envers la loi martiale."
Bill ne ferait jamais ça.
Mais tu fais ce que tu dois faire.
Je veux dire, Bill ne pourrait jamais...
ętre sur pied de nouveau.
Chéri...
Traite ça comme tu le veux.
Ils le respecteront.
Un jour.
Ici le XO. M. Gaeta,
envoyez le message suivant
ŕ tous les capitaines.
Début du message :
"Les opérations d'approvisionnement
de ce vaisseau
ne sont pas, je répčte, pas optionnelles.
Que tous les vaisseaux reprennent
les approvisionnements prévus
immédiatement.
Le défaut d'obtempérer entrainera
des mesures sévčres."
Message terminé.
T'es contente maintenant ?
- Je contourne.
- Je fais diversion.
Salut.
On n'est pas des Cylons.
Ouais, vous ętes humains.
Vous avez une âme, vous nagez dans
le courant. On a déjŕ entendu ça avant.
Hey, Flotte Coloniale.
T'as pas vu l'uniforme ?
On a déjŕ vu des Cylons en uniforme.
- On est humains.
- C'est ça, ouais...
- Tout le monde sur Caprica est mort.
- Pas vous.
Je viens juste d'arriver.
Je veux vos noms.
Je m'appelle Anders.
- Samuel T. Anders ?
- Ouais, c'est moi.
C'est Joman, Rally, Ten point.
Sue-Shaun, Crip-Key, Morris Fink.
Kara, c'est les Caprica Buccaneers.
Je pense pas.
Donne-moi une balle fillette,
et je te la mets dans le cul.
S'il-te-plait, essaye.
Maintenant qu'on s'entend si bien,
vous pourriez arręter de
pointer vos armes sur nous ?

survit ŕ un holocauste nucléaire ?
On était dans les montagnes pendant
l'attaque. Entraînement en haute altitude.
On est en cavale depuis.
Vous faites quoi ?
Pillage de munitions
dans les dépôts militaires.
Médocs Antiradiation.
Bousiller du toaster
quand ils se montrent.
Pareil que nous.
Ok...
Combien vous avez fait de fautes techniques
dans les playoffs contre Aerilon ?
- Tu rigoles ?
- T'as la réponse,
ou t'as une balle.
Trois.
Faux.
- Quatre.
- Trois.
Le dernier a été annulé
d'aprčs la vidéo d'arbitrage.
Il a raison, Starbuck.
J'ai perdu 20 Cubits sur cette partie.
Ça ira.
Pour l'instant.
A trois.
Un.
- Deux.
- Trois.
Vous savez que vous ętes nuls les gars ?
Vous savez pas tirer, ni faire une passe.
C'est sűr, vous savez pas
marquer de point.
Tous des critiques.
Voilŕ votre médicament,
Madame la Présidente
et un petit plus venant de la cuisine.
Merci, Caporal Venner.
Du chamalla et du réglisse.
Vous en voulez ?
Je déteste le réglisse.
Moi aussi.
C'est intéressant qu'il vous appelle
encore Madame la Présidente.
Vous avez encore beaucoup
de partisans dehors.
Quelque chose d'horrible
arrive. Je le sens.
M., le Cpt. de la raffinerie
refuse toujours de coopérer.
Et maintenant sept autres vaisseaux cargo
refusent de donner leur ravitaillement.
Nourriture, médicaments,
męme du café.
Du café ?
Ça devient ridicule.
On s'en branle. Il est temps d'avoir
leur attention. J'envoie les marines.
Je veux un Raptor et
une équipe d'abordage armée
pour chaque vaisseau refusant l'ordre
de réapprovisionnement.
Nous sommes vraiment
limités en hommes.
Je ne crois pas avoir assez
de marines gradés
pour commander autant d'abordages.
Mettez des pilotes
et des officiers de pont
pour commander ces abordages
si vous le devez.
Dites-leur d'y aller et de ramener
le ravitaillement.
Quoi qu'il en coűte.
- Occupez-vous en, Lieutenant.
- Oui, monsieur.
TRANSPORTEUR LOURD "GIDEON"
Tout le monde, reculez, d'accord ?!
Nous sommes juste lŕ
pour le ravitaillement !
Restez en dehors du chemin
et personne ne sera blessé !
Pour la derničre fois,
reculez, d'accord ?
Cessez le feu ! Cessez le feu !
Cessez le feu !
Quatre civils morts.
Putain, comment ça a pu arriver ?
Vous attendiez quoi, génie ? Vous
chargez un pilote de contrôler la foule.
Palladino !
Avez-vous donné l'ordre
de tirer sur cette foule ?
Non Monsieur, bien sűr que non.
La foule nous encerclait.
Étaient-ils armés ?
Non Monsieur.
Mais... Il fallait y ętre.
Ils hurlaient et criaient sur nous et...
c'est devenu violent.
Ils ont lancé des choses,
des boîtes...
de café, je crois...
Du café ?!
Vous avez tiré sur des gens
parce quils jetaient du café ?
La foule était hors de contrôle.
On a été débordés.
Mes hommes se faisaient blesser.
Quelqu'un a tiré.
Je ne sais pas qui c'était.
Et lŕ c'est devenu l'enfer.
Si on a jamais eu besoin de toi, Bill
c'est maintenant.
Des troupes tirant sur des civils
non armés. C'est une parodie.
Il a vraiment dépassé les bornes. Cela
va causer une explosion dans la flotte.
La presse va s'en donner ŕ cśur joie.
Les vaisseaux vont se séparer.
Les Cylons pourront nous éliminer,
quelques vaisseaux ŕ la fois.
Je dois sortir d'ici maintenant.
Je suis avec vous.
Je suis contente que vous disiez cela.
Je veux emmener Billy et Elosha avec moi.
Bien sűr.
J'ai trouvé un moyen de nous rendre
au hangar de pont.
Et je peux nous avoir un Raptor.
Nous devons avoir une autorisation
pour quitter le vaisseau.
- Je sais comment obtenir ça.
- Vraiment ?
La question est : oů allons-nous
aprčs avoir quitté ce vaisseau ?
Nous devrons trouver
oů nous cacher dans la flotte
J'ai une idée pour ça.
Vous n'allez pas l'aimer.
Je ne suis pas fait pour ça,
je ne l'ai jamais été.
Ne parle pas comme ça, Saul.
C'est ton heure.
Moi et Bill, côte ŕ côte,
c'était le marché.
Ça n'aurait jamais dű ętre moi tout seul.
Que tu le veuilles ou non, tu commandes,
tu devrais t'y faire.
Je ne veux pas m'y faire.
Je ne veux pas commander.
Tu comprends pas ?
Putain, pourquoi je t'écoute ?
De quoi tu... Je ne t'ai jamais dit
d'envoyer des troupes sur ce vaisseau.
Non, tu ne m'as pas dit d'envoyer des
troupes. Tu manipules seulement.
Tout le temps. Tu mets le couteau
dans la plaie et tu le tournes.
D'accord, tu vas me reprocher
tes propres insuffisances ?
- Je ne te reproche rien, Ellen.
- Putain, tu es tellement passif
que si je ne te poussais pas
tu ne sortirais jamais la tęte de cette
putain de bouteille et tu ne ferais rien.
Je t'avais prévenue.
Je te le dis.
Lâche-moi...
- Je t'aime tellement.
- Ferme-la, Ellen.
Je suppose que tu me hais vraiment.
Je ne sais pas si ça a
de l'importance maintenant,
mais je suis désolée de
t'avoir entraîné lŕ-dedans.
- Tu sais, ce que nous avions...
- n'était rien.
Rien.
Tu es une machine. Pas moi.
Quoi que je sois,
je sais ce que j'ai ressenti.
Un programme n'a pas de sentiments.
Je n'ai jamais voulu te blesser.
J'aimerais ętre seul, s'il vous plait.
Ça va aller, merci.
Et comment allons-nous ce soir ?
Que voulez-vous ?
Je suis ici pour déterminer si vous ętes,
oui ou non, un Cylon.
Votre bras, s'il vous plaît.
Son test ne marche pas trčs bien.
Vous m'avez donné le feu vert.
Le test fonctionne...
trčs bien.
Chef ?
Chef ?
Je vous ai menti, Sharon.
J'ai caché votre véritable nature
au reste de la flotte
pour mes propres intéręts.
Que lui avez-vous fait ?
Il ne respire pas.
Non, il est en train de mourir, Sharon.
Je peux le sauver...
Si vous me dites combien il reste
de Cylons dans la flotte.
Je ne sais pas, mais je n'ai pas de pouls.
Si vous le savez.
Au plus profond de ce que vous appelez
un subconscient, vous savez combien.
- Je ne sais pas !
- Il n'a pas le temps pour ça, Sharon.
Ses organes s'arrętent.
Dans dix secondes,
il sera en complčte mort cérébrale.
Maintenant, combien ?
Est-ce que vous l'aimez, Sharon ?
Vous seule pouvez le sauver !
Dix !
Neuf !
Est-ce que vous l'aimez ?
Est-ce que vous l'aimez, Sharon ?
Huit ! Ils sont huit !
Trčs bien, on va décharger ces armes.
On y va !
On est tombés sur un dépôt d'armes
ŕ environ 18 klicks au nord.
- On a rapporté beaucoup de jouets.
- Quel est cet endroit ?
Le lycée de Delphes. Les toasters
ne patrouillent pas dans ce secteur.
C'est un bon endroit pour
baisser sa garde, casser la graine.
- Combien ętes-vous ici ?
- 53, on était presque une centaine
avant l'embuscade des toasters
la semaine derničre.
- Allons-y.
- D'autres équipes de pyramide ?
Non, juste nous. Les autres sont des
écolos, des randonneurs pour la plupart.
Quel est votre stock
de masques antiradiations ?
On a dévalisé un ou deux hôpitaux
dans Pilgrim Bay.
Je pense qu'on en a assez
pour trois mois.
Allons vous trouver un endroit
oů dormir, venez.
53, hein ?
Pas vraiment une armée.
Mais bien mieux que nous deux si on veut
donner l'assaut ŕ une base aérienne, voler
un Raider et se casser de cette plančte.
Je n'en ai que pour un moment.
Docteur...
J'ai besoin de votre aide.
Mais c'est illégal, dangereux et en
violation de votre serment d'officier.
Vous ętes nulle comme vendeuse.
Caporal !
Caporal Venner.
Je voulais juste vous dire combien
la Présidente apprécie
tout ce que vous faites pour elle.
Tout ce que je peux faire pour lui
faciliter les choses.
Super. Elle...
a une demande spéciale.
Je voudrais juste votre signature,
Monsieur.
Pourquoi est-ce qu'on
ferme la coursive B ?
Tests d'intégrité, Monsieur.
Elle a été salement amôchée.
lors de l'abordage des toasters.
Et on a eu des baisses de pression lŕ bas.
Dites-leur de la réparer.
- Désolé.
- Lieutenant.
C'est assez merdique
en ce moment, hein ?
Oui, c'est assez merdique
la plupart du temps.
Si des gens sont contrariés, ils devraient
passer par la filičre officielle.
- Je ne suis pas sure de comprendre...
- J'ai effectué des contrôles de maintenance,
j'ai détecté une série d'appels
cryptés ces derničres heures.
Vous ne seriez pas au courant
de quelque chose par hasard ?
Non Monsieur. Les appels non enregistrés
sont contre le rčglement.
C'est exact.
Je suis sűr que tu n'approuveras pas.
Mais je suppose que ce n'est pas nouveau.
Je voulais juste que tu saches que...
ça n'a rien ŕ voir avec toi et moi.
Au revoir, papa.
Vous donnez un coup
de main ici ou quoi ?
Ils vont mettre le Chef ici, vous savez ?
Je me fous qu'ils mettent une perruche géante.
Le Col. a dit de construire une cellule,
on construit une cellule.
- Ce n'est pas juste. Il est des nôtres.
- Non. C'est l'un des leurs.
- Il l'a toujours été mais on le ne voyait pas.
- Non, il est innocent. Elle l'a piégé.
Quelle loyauté.
Tu couchais avec lui aussi ?
Si tu veux te défouler sur quelqu'un,
fais-le sur Boomer.
C'est elle qui fait mettre le Chef
en cellule, pas nous.
Bonsoir, Monsieur.
Bonsoir, Dee.
Qui aurait cru vous croiser ici.
- Tout est pręt ?
- Affirmatif.
Désolée Capitaine.
Je ne peux pas bavarder aujourd'hui.
Capitaine !
J'ai des problčmes avec le
compteur de munitions sur mon Raptor.
Je n'arrive pas ŕ le faire fonctionner.
Changement de plan les gars.
Au lieu d'aller me pieuter,
je vais prendre une minute
pour faire le boulot du Lieutenant.
- Oui, Monsieur.
- Aprčs vous.
Ok, fait ça bien, mais pas trop bien.
Stop !
Soldat, savez-vous qui je suis ?
Bien. Vous et moi avons
quelque chose en commun.
Nous avons fait le serment de protéger et
défendre les Articles de la Colonisation.
Ces articles sont attaqués,
ainsi que le principe démocratique de notre
mode de vie. Maintenant, mon devoir...
ne me permet pas de laisser
cela se produire sans réagir.
J'ai donc l'intention de passer cette
écoutille et quitter ce vaisseau.
Bordel.
Ils devraient déjŕ ętre ici.
Vous pouvez me laisser la voie libre,
ou vous pouvez m'abattre.
Vous allez devoir décider
oů va votre loyauté.
Madame la Présidente...
- Madame la Présidente, par ici.
- Billy...
Madame la Présidente. Je ne vais pas
monter sur ce vaisseau avec vous.
Comment ?
Je comprends ce que
vous essayez de faire.
Mais cela va diviser la flotte.
Au mieux, cela va créer une insurrection
contre Adama.
Et au pire, une guerre civile. Y participer
est une limite que je ne veux pas franchir.
Nous n'avons pas beaucoup de temps.
Je vous souhaite bonne chance.
Dustoff 2-7, les contrôles sont verts, paré
au lancement pour une mission médicale.
Demandons autorisation de décollage.
- Contente de vous voir, vous allez bien ?
- Je crois.
Mes pieds ne touchaient pratiquement
plus terre en montant ici.
<i>- Je vois ce que vous voulez dire.
- Dustoff 2-7</i>
<i>Départ rčglementaire par la porte
trois approuvé. Décollage autorisé.</i>
Rčglementaire porte trois, bien reçu.
Monsieur, le Caporal Venner signale
que l'ex-Présidente a disparu.
- Disparu ?
- Deux hommes ŕ terre, la cellule est vide.
Merde. Alertez la sécurité.
Passez en condition 2 !
Personne ne rentre ou sort
de ce vaisseau !
Attention, condition deux
dans tout le vaisseau.
<i>Je répčte, condition 2
dans tout le vaisseau.</i>
Les enregistrements de vol indiquent
qu'un Raptor a quitté le vaisseau
il y a deux minutes avec le doc Cottle
pour une urgence médicale.
Médicale ?
- Confirmez ça.
- On a leur transpondeur sur le dradis.
Cap 2-8-7 inclinaison 0-0-3. Ecart 2-7.
Contactez la CAP pour une interception.
Et sortez-moi le Capt. Adama
de la cellule.
Monsieur, Dr. Cottle est toujours ŕ bord.
Il dit qu'Apollo l'a forcé ŕ demander
un Raptor sous menace armée.
Le fils de pute.
Dee, passez-moi ce Raptor.
La CAP a la cible en visuel.
Faites demi-tour Apollo, ou j'ordonne
ŕ la CAP de vous descendre.
- On ne reviendra pas.
- Je vais donner l'ordre.
Ne pensez pas que je ne le ferais pas
parce que vous ętes le fils du patron.
Alors faites ce que
vous avez ŕ faire, Galactica.
Apollo, terminé.
Faites un tir de semonce.
Hotdog, ici Galactica. Tir de semonce.
Confirmez.
Reçu, Galactica.
Hotdog reporte qu'ils
ne font pas demi-tour.
Oů sont-ils maintenant ?
Ils approchent du Cloud Nine
d'aprčs le dradis.
S'ils s'arriment on pourrait les perdre.
Le Cloud Nine est un des plus gros
hubs de transport de la flotte.
Des navettes y entrent
et en sortent constamment.
S'ils en prennent une et décollent ça sera
avant qu'on ait pu stopper le trafic.
Galactica, ici Hotdog.
Demande instructions.
<i>Galactica, ici Hotdog.
Quelles sont les instructions ?</i>
<i>Dois-je tirer ou pas ?</i>
Dee, dites ŕ Hotdog de cessez le feu.
Je répčte, cessez le feu. Ne tirez pas.
Hotdog, ici Galactica. Cessez le feu.
Je répčte, ne tirez pas.
Ils n'ont pas pu le faire seuls.
Personne n'a remarqué
d'appels non-enregistrés ?
Des communications brouillées ?
Non, Monsieur.
Rien.
On est en sécurité, pour le moment.
Heureux de vous voir,
Mme la Présidente.
Capitaine Apollo...
Que fait M. Zarek ici ?
Dčs que Tigh se sera remis,
il enverra des troupes nous chercher.
Si on veut s'en sortir, on doit
continuer ŕ bouger. J'ai pensé...
que M. Zarek est le seul dans la flotte
avec assez d'amis louches
qui peuvent nous cacher.
J'aime sa façon de le dire.
Et bien, M. Zarek, il semblerait que
l'ennemi de mon ennemi est mon ami.
Appelez-moi Tom.
Notre navette attend, madame.
Nous devons nous dépęcher.
C'est tout ce que tu peux faire ?
Contente de savoir qu'installer un
terrain réglementaire
de pyramide était une
des priorités de la résistance.
Y'a des choses dont
on ne peut pas se passer.
On joue.
Tu déconnes ?
Je vais te massacrer.
Ouais, on verra.
J'allais passer en pro.
Un genou pourri m'a sortie de la course.
Je vois.
Ca sera ton excuse quand
je te botterai le cul ?
"Mon pauvre genou me fait mal."
Au moins j'ai une excuse.
Je vois pas ce que sera la tienne.
Joli tir.
Merci
Merci Doc, j'apprécie.
Ne me remerciez pas.
Remerciez-la.
Pourquoi, qu'est-ce
qu'elle a ŕ voir lŕ dedans ?
Tout.
Rien.
L'amour est une étrange et
merveilleuse chose, Chef.
Estimez-vous heureux
d'avoir au moins pu ressentir ça.
Męme si c'était avec une machine.
Que vont-ils faire d'elle ?
Ils mettent en place un
nouveau complexe de détention.
Il y aura des tests.
Psychiatriques.
Physiques.
Comme si elle était...
Comme un rat de laboratoire ?
C'est l'idée.
C'est tout simplement super.
Le fiston chéri de Bill Adama
tire les ficelles sous tes yeux,
et tu le laisses s'échapper.
Tu es la risée de tout le monde !
Tu ne voulais pas
de ce commandement !
Et bien ne t'inquičte pas.
Tu ne l'auras plus trčs longtemps.
Tout ça parce que, au moment venu,
- Tu t'es fait remettre ŕ ta place.
- C'était son fils.
Saul.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe
sur mon vaisseau ?
Attendez dans le couloir.
Ellen, puis-je parler a mon XO ?
Bien sűr.
Doucement.
Qu'est-il arrivé ?
J'ai tout fait foiré, et en beauté.
- Comment ?
- J'ai pris de mauvaises décisions.
- J'ai aussi fait ça.
- Pas ŕ ce point.
Tu vas nous verser un verre ou quoi ?
Je n'ai jamais eu besoin de gens qui
remettent en question mes décisions.
En particulier si ils n'ont
jamais eu de commandement.
Ils ne comprennent pas la pression.
Tu prends une décision,
ça affecte la vie de milliers
et tu n'as personne vers qui
te tourner pour te soutenir.
On dirait que c'est facile
en te regardant.
Tu sais que c'est faux maintenant.
Y'a plein de morceaux ŕ recoller.
Alors on les recollera ensemble.
Oů est mon fils ?
Je t'aime, Chef.

LES CYLONS FURENT
CRÉÉS PAR L'HOMME
ILS ÉVOLUÈRENT
ILS SE RÉVOLTÈRENT
IL Y A DE NOMBREUSES COPIES
ET ILS ONT UN PLAN.
Précédemment dans
Battlestar Galactica...
Je n'ai que
quelques mois à vivre.
Et d'ici là...
Je guiderai ce peuple
vers son salut.
C'est mon unique but.
Loués soient les Dieux.
Voici notre salut.
Les actions de mutinerie et de sédition
dans l'armée par Laura Roslin
ne pouvaient être tolérées.
Ainsi le Cdt. Adama n'a
pas eu d'autre choix
que de la démettre
de ses fonctions.
-Je dois sortir de là.
- Je suis avec vous.
Je crois qu'il sont
vraiment humains.
Tout le monde est mort
sur Caprica.
- Pas toi.
- Je viens juste d'arriver.
Pas vraiment une armée,
mais bien mieux que nous deux si on veut
donner l'assaut à une base aérienne, voler
un Raider lourd et se casser de cette planète.
Contente de savoir qu'installer
un terrain réglementaire
de pyramide était une
des priorités de la résistance.
- Joli tir.
- Merci.
Vous pouvez me laisser la voie libre,
ou vous pouvez m'abattre.
J'ai l'intention de passer cette écoutille

Cally a tiré sur Boomer.
Non, non, non.
Je t'aime, Chef.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe

J'ai tout fait foirer, et en beauté.
J'ai pris de mauvaises décisions.
Y'a plein de morceaux à recoller.
Alors on les recollera ensemble.
CAPRICA SOUS-OCCUPATION CYLON
CAMP DE BASE DE LA RÉSISTANCE
T'es réveillée depuis une heure.
Alors que vas-tu faire si tu
ne peux pas retourner sur ton vaisseau ?
J'y retourne.
Je sais qu'on a pu te choper par surprise.
- Va te faire foutre.
- Charmant.
Mais en vérité...
On sait vraiment pas
ce qu' on fout ici.
La plupart de nos tactiques, de nos trucs,
on les a vues dans des films.
L'avis d'un professionnel
nous serait utile.
Tu veux un avis ?
Vous êtes en train de perdre
cette bataille.
Abandonnez avant de tous mourir.
Montez plus dans les montagnes
au-dessus des radiations.
Et planquez-vous.
Et après ?
On attend de mourir ?
Dès mon retour sur le Galactica
j'enverrai une mission de sauvetage.
Ouais, c'est ça...
Quand je dis que
je fais quelque chose,
je le fais.
T'es toujours aussi
chiante le matin ?
Compte là-dessus.
Mon style de femme.
Nous avons une mission à accomplir.
Et alors ?
La mission.
Ok. Peu importe.
Je suis désolée, d'accord ?
Je ne voulais pas dire que...
Je t'ai eu !
C'est bas.
Vraiment, vraiment bas.
Réjouis toi un peu.
C'est seulement la fin
du monde.
Sue-shaun, je veux que tu vérifies
le périmètre, surtout sur le flanc.
Ok.
Les Cylons ont une piste de
réapprovisionnement sur ce versant.
Un Raider lourd fait une halte
pour se réapprovisionner
chaque après-midi,
comme une horloge.
Les machines aiment la routine.
Il est toujours gardé par moins de
trois modèles mécaniques.
On l'a laissé tranquille
jusqu'à maintenant.
Alors ?
Quel est le plan ?
Passer par ce ravin, approcher
la piste par le côté sud.
Disperser nos hommes en lisière, attendre
que le Raider atterrisse,
surveiller le ravitaillement.
Dès que le plein de tylium est fait, on descend
les gardes et on fait sauter la station.
Je croyais que tu voulais
le Raider intact.
C'est du solide, crois-moi.
Détruire la station égratignera
à peine la coque
mais ça devrait nous donner assez
de temps pour monter dans le Raider.
Quand je serai dedans,
j'explose son cerveau
et je commence à travailler pour qu'il...
A couvert !
Bougez !
Allez, tous à couvert !
Retraite ! Tout le monde recule !
On se barre !

Merci beaucoup.
Je suis heureux d'être de retour.
Il y a des choses
que l'on ne dit pas assez souvent.
Comme ce que nous représentons
les uns pour les autres.
Vous tous...
comptez beaucoup pour moi.
Je veux juste que vous le sachiez.
Remettons-nous au travail.
Je me sens bizarre. Comme...
plus proche de la tombe.
Tu devrais voir ça
avec le Docteur.
M. Gaeta ?
A votre avis, où sont-ils ?
Le Raptor volé avec le Capitaine Adama,
- L'ex-Présidente...
- Les fugitifs.
Les fugitifs...
ont rejoint le Cloud Nine
la semaine dernière.
Nous les avons réellement
perdus là-bas
à cause du trafic important
allant et venant du Cloud Nine.
Maintenant, ils peuvent s'être installés
n'importe où dans la flotte.
Je veux qu'on les trouve.
Elle était suffisamment dangereuse
en tant que symbole de la résistance,
mais maintenant avec l'aide de Lee...
Je veux que l'on fouille
tous les vaisseaux de la flotte.
Procédures de quarantaine.
Isolez un vaisseau du reste de la flotte,
S'ils ne sont pas dedans,
on le garde en quarantaine
a l'écart du reste de la flotte.
Elle peut se cacher,
mais elle ne peut pas s'enfuir.
Dee, commencez les
procédures de quarantaine.
Commencez par le Cloud Nine.
Combien de temps resterons-nous
cachés dans cette chambre froide ?
Je ne sais pas.
J'ai communiqué votre dernier message
au Conseil des Douze.
Et ils ont décidé que le fait de vous
soutenir ouvertement demande plus de...
délibération.
Je dois lancer un appel au peuple.
Soyez convaincante,
et l'Astral Queen sera
le premier à vous suivre.
Comme s'ils n'avaient rien de
mieux à faire que de vous obéir.
J'ai une autre nouvelle
à vous transmettre :
Zeus est revenu en Olympe.
Adama a repris la barre
Mon père ?
De retour ?
Ça vient juste d'être reçu par radio.
C'est un dur à cuire.
Nous avons besoin...
de quelque chose
venant du cœur.
Quelque chose...
d'humain et d'intime.
qui galvanisera le peuple.
Tel un fils...
dénonçant son père.
Je m'appelle Lee Adama.
Jusqu'à récemment, j'étais
le Commandant d'escadre du Galactica.
Mais lorsque le Commandant Adama,
mon père,
décida de monter un putsch militaire
contre la Présidente,
je ne pouvais plus soutenir, ni lui,
ni ses actions.
J'aime mon père.
Je le respecte.
Mais dans ce cas,
il a tort.
On doit s'opposer à lui.
J'en appelle à tous les libre-penseurs
de cette flotte...
Je ne peux pas faire ça.
Désolé. Je pensais pouvoir
mais je ne peux pas.
Je vais jouer la carte religieuse.
Je sais exactement ce que je dois faire.
Comment marche ce truc ?
Tout va bien.
Vous êtes à l'hôpital.
Ils vous ont amenée ici hier matin.
Vous avez été touché à l'abdomen.
Je m'appelle Simon.
Comment vous appelez-vous ?
Kara.
Kara Thrace.
Bien.
Vous étiez au bloc pendant 2 heures.
J'ai retiré la balle.
J'ai pensé un moment que
vous ne vous en tireriez pas.
Calmez-vous.
Je sais que ça fait mal.
Qui m'a amenée ici ?
Un gars nommé Anders.
Il était joueur pro de pyramid,
aussi étrange que cela parait.
Ouais, je le connais.
Où est-il ?
Il est mort...
sur le billard.
Je ne le croyais que légèrement blessé.
Il s'avère...
qu'un éclat d'obus
avait entaillé son aorte.
Hémorragie interne massive.
Je suis désolé. On a fait
tout ce qu'on pouvait.
B'jour.
Je vois que vous engloutissez
rapidement ces fluides,
c'est bien.
Êtes-vous un Cylon ?
Vous en pensez quoi ?
Que vous n'avez pas répondu.
Je ne suis sûrement pas un Cylon.
Bien sûr, que voulez-vous que je dise ?
Si j'étais un Cylon, je ne l'avouerais pas.
Je peux partir ?
La porte est là.
Putain de docteurs.
Je suis donc un docteur,
pas un Cylon.
Le jury délibère toujours.
Cependant, les Cylons auraient
de meilleures chambres que ça.
Où se trouve ce trou à rats ?
On est à 20 klicks au nord de Delphes.
Avant c'était un asile.
C'est au moins l'un des rares endroits
que les Cylons n'ont pas encore trouvés
D'accord.
Alors je suis supposée croire qu'il y a
vraiment une résistance dehors ?
Chut, ne le dites à personne.
Nous essayons de rester discrets.
C'est l'heure de vos anti-douleurs.
Puis-je parler en faveur
de la Technicienne Cally ?
Elle à été... secouée
par ce qu'elle a vécu sur Kobol.
Être sur Kobol,
combattre les Cylons,
c'est bouleversant,
pour nous tous.
Je ne crois pas qu'elle
avait tous ses esprits,
quand elle a tiré sur Boomer.
Est-ce que vous l'aimiez, Chef ?
Pardon ?
Boomer, est-ce que vous l'aimiez ?
Je pensais l'aimer.
Lorsque vous pensez aimer
quelqu'un, vous l'aimez.
C'est ça l'amour... des pensées.
Elle était un Cylon.
Une machine.
C'est ça qu'était Boomer ?
Une machine ?
Une chose ?
C'est ce qu'elle s'est avérée être...
Elle signifiait plus que ça pour nous.
Elle signifiait plus que ça pour moi.
Elle était quelqu'un
de vital et de vivant...
sur mon vaisseau....
pendant presque deux ans.
Elle ne pouvait pas
n'être qu'une machine.
Pourriez-vous aimer une machine ?
Non, monsieur.
Je suppose que je n'aurais pas pu.
Cally....
a fait feu sans permission,
mettant en danger la vie
de ses coéquipiers.
Trente jours de cellule.
Rompez.
Merci, monsieur.
Vous la reverrez, Chef.
Pardon ?
Il y a plusieurs copies.
Vous la reverrez.
Combien de patients avez-vous ici ?
Est-ce encore un interrogatoire ?
Je trouve ça bizarre, je suis ici depuis
deux jours et je n'ai vu personne d'autre
que vous.
Nous avons 223 patients en ce moment.
Deux docteurs, et cinq enseignantes
qui jouent les infirmières.
J'ai connu une enseignante
qui se faisait passer pour le président.
Vraiment ?
C'est horriblement calme.
Aucun cri, aucun gémissement. Aucun...
"docteur, docteur, aidez-moi
s'il vous plaît. Ça fait mal."
La plupart de nos patients
succombent à un grave empoisonnement
aux radiations.
Les symptômes comportent
une énorme fatigue
et d'immédiates nausées.
Suivent plusieurs jours
de relative bonne santé.
Après cela,
la mort cellulaire des tissus gastriques
et intestinaux cause
diarrhées massives,
saignements intestinaux,
et déshydratation.
Ce n'est pas beau.
Mais c'est...
calme.
Le facteur le plus mortel ici,
c'est l'infection.
C'est pourquoi vous êtes en quarantaine.
Nous ne savons pas ce que
vous avez ramené avec vous.
Les résultats de vos tests
arriveront cet après-midi.
Ok.
Presque fini.
Je crois qu'il y a peut-être
un kyste, sur l'un de vos ovaires.
C'est grave ?
Nan, ça devrait aller.
On gardera un œil dessus.
On doit garder ce système
reproductif en bonne forme.
C'est votre capital
le plus précieux.
C'est ça.
Je suis sérieux.
Trouver des femmes fertiles
de votre âge, en bonne santé
est une priorité absolue
pour la résistance.
Et vous serez contente de savoir que
vous êtes un bien précieux pour nous.
Je ne suis pas
un bien.
Je suis pilote de Viper.
Vous voyez des Vipers par ici ?
Vous réalisez bien que vous faites
partie de la poignée de femmes
restante sur cette planète,
encore capable d'avoir des enfants.
D'accord ?
C'est votre compétence la
plus précieuse maintenant.
Je ne veux pas d'enfants
alors laissez tomber, ok ?
Personne ne vous force.
Prenez juste un moment
pour réfléchir à...
l'endroit où vous êtes...
à la situation.
La race humaine est
au bord de l'extinction.
Et pour être honnête avec vous,
les mères potentielles
sont bien plus précieuses maintenant
que tout un escadron de...
pilotes de Vipers.
Je n'aurai pas dû parler de ça. J'aurais
du savoir que vous seriez sensible.
Beaucoup de femmes avec votre passé
renoncent à la grossesse.
Mon passé ?
J'ai vu les fractures sur vos radios.
Beaucoup de vieilles fractures
de l'enfance.
C'est intéressant de...
de voir comment vous avez cassé
chaque doigt
sur chaque main.
Chaque fracture au même endroit, entre
la première et la deuxième articulation.
Est-ce que quelqu'un a fracturé
vos doigts, Kara ?
Sortez.
Les enfants de parents violents
ont souvent peur
de reproduire cette violence
sur leurs propres enfants.
Sortez !
Elle plaisante avec ça ?
Je sais que c'est dur à croire, mais ce
message s'est propagé à toute la flotte.
C'est de la foutaise religieuse.
"Il semble que j'ai été choisie pour aider
à vous guider vers la Terre promise.
Je ne contesterai pas ce choix.
J'essaierai simplement de jouer
mon rôle dans ce plan."
"C'est pourquoi, l'heure venue,
je donnerai un signal à la flotte.
Tous ceux qui souhaitent honorer les Dieux
et prendre la voie de la destinée,
me suivront vers Kobol."
"C'est là que nous rencontrerons
le serviteur des Dieux
avec la Flèche d'Apollo."
Nous avons cinq Raptors
avec des équipes d'assaut de marines
attendant d'aborder l'Astral Queen.
Personne ne va la suivre.
Personne ne va croire ces foutaises.
Personne n'est aussi stupide.
Et s'il y en a
qui veulent faire une fuite
suicidaire vers Kobol...
S'il vous plaît, laissez-les faire.
Combien de temps avant le saut ?
Deux minutes.
Aucun autre vaisseau ne s'est
déclaré être avec nous ?
Pas encore.
Oh, non, ce... Non...
S'il vous plaît,
ce n'est pas nécessaire.
Donnez-leur votre bénédiction.
Non.
Ce n'est pas bien.
- Ce n'est pas ce que je suis.
- Laura.
C'est votre voie
Celle que les Dieux ont choisi pour vous.
Celle que vous avez choisi pour vous même.
Sue-shaun !
Anders, on a déjà parcouru
cette lisière dix fois déjà.
Elle a dû se prendre une balle.
Elle était là, près des véhicules.
Elle a dû se lever et ramper hors d'ici.
Nous devons encore fouiller toute la zone.
On aurait pas dû se retirer si vite.
- Je la croyais avec nous.
- On est tombés dans une embuscade.
On a tous été séparés.
On n'aurait rien pu y faire.
Kara, mieux que personne,
l'aurait compris. Trouvons-la.
Attendez, attendez un peu.
Je sais où se trouve Starbuck.
Sharon ?
Où étais-tu ?
- Je te suivais.
- Qui est-elle ?
Elle est avec nous.
Tu es le père de mon enfant, Helo.
Je ne vais pas te perdre.
Où est-elle ?
Nous sommes prêts.
Envoyez le signal et sautez.
LAstral Queen a sauté.
Voyons maintenant
combien vont suivre.
Pour traîner et attendre que Starbuck
se pointe avec cette stupide flèche ?
Deux, trois au plus.
Bonjour.
Vous avez meilleure mine.
C'est quoi cette nouvelle cicatrice ?
Ils ont du rouvrir hier soir
pendant que vous dormiez.
Une hémorragie interne
à endiguer. Rien d'inquiétant.
Tout va bien se passer.
J'en ai bientôt fini avec vous, Starbuck.
Jolie façon de le dire.
Encore un ou deux tests et...
J'allais dire qu'on vous
renvoyait chez vous.
Je suppose qu'on va
vous renvoyer au combat.
Ça me paraît bien.
Je viens de me réveiller.
Maintenant vous allez
vous rendormir.
C'est vous le doc...
...l'attente des résultats des tests
sur le prélèvement d'ovaires,
l'ablation totale sera réalisée demain.
Si les tests sont positifs,
le sujet sera déplacé
à l'unité de traitement
pour disposition définitive.
Est-ce du regret que j'entends
dans votre voix, Simon ?
Si c'est le cas, ça ne vous
regarde sûrement pas.
Seigneurs de Kobol,
aidez-moi.
Bonjour.
Vous êtes sûre que vous allez bien ?
Vous savez, il y a effectivement quelque
chose qui me tracasse ces derniers temps.
Je ne vous ai jamais dit que
mon nom de code est Starbuck.
Vous ne pouvez pas me tuer.
Crève !
Sue-shaun.
Sue-shaun, c'est moi, Kara.
Tiens le coup, Ok ?
Je vais te sortir de là.
Non. Trop tard.
Coupe l'alimentation.
Mais ça va te tuer.
On peut pas vivre comme ça...
comme des machines à bébés...
Je t'en prie.
Je t'en prie.
Bonjour Starbuck.
Kara, viens !
On y va !
Allez, allez !
Baisse-toi !
Kara baisse-toi !
On y va !
Faut qu'on bouge !
Montez !
Bougez ! Grouillez-vous !
Allez, allez, allez !
24 vaisseaux, Monsieur.
C'est presque un tiers de la flotte.
Pourquoi ?
Ils font des recherches,
sur l'hybridation Humain-Cylon.
Humain-Cylon ?
Ils appellent ça des "fermes".
Ta blessure a l'air bien.
Des fermes, alors. C'est génial.
Ils allaient faire quoi,
m'engrosser avec un petit Cylon ?
Ils allaient essayer.
Nous n'avons pas eu
beaucoup de succès jusqu'ici.
Ils ne peuvent soi-disant pas se reproduire.
Tu sais, biologiquement.
Alors ils essaient tous les moyens
pour se reproduire.
Pourquoi ?
La procréation.
C'est l'un des commandements
de Dieu : "soyez féconds".
On n'y arrive pas.
On a essayé.
- Alors on a décidé...
- De violer des femmes humaines.
Si tu avais accepté de porter
un enfant, ça serait volontaire,
peut-être même avec
quelqu'un que tu apprécies.
Comme vous deux ?
Nous sommes différents.
Ça veut dire quoi cette connerie ?
Ils ont cette théorie...
Peut-être la chose qui leur
manquait, c'était l'amour.
Alors Sharon et moi...
- étions supposés...
- ... tomber amoureux ?
Ils n'ont pas demandé à Sue-Shaun
si elle voulait tomber amoureuse, ok ?
Ils lui ont mis un tube à l'intérieur
et ils l'ont branchée à une machine !
Ils savent qui tu es, Kara.
Tu es spéciale.
Leoben te l'a dit.
Tu as une destinée.
- Starbuck, c'est quoi l'autre cicatrice ?
- Je sais pas.
Je suis pas sûre de
vouloir le savoir maintenant.
Tu le sais ?
Non.
Combien de femmes ils ont
dans ces fermes ?
Des centaines...
Des milliers peut-être.
Je ne sais pas, je n'ai pas
accèdé à ces données.
Voilà ce qu'on va faire.
On prend le Raider lourd,
on le bourre de troupes.
On trouve une autre ferme, on la libère,
puis une autre, et une autre...
C'est pas pour ça que
t'es venue sur Caprica.
Va trouver la Terre.
Et toi ?
T'as dis que t'avais besoin
de conseils de professionels.
On se démerdera.
On s'en est sorti jusque là.
Ils vous tueront.
Tu vas mourir ici.
Tu le sais.
Beaucoup de gens sont morts ici.
Je te le dis,
si je dois mourir ici,
je bousillerai jusqu'à la dernière
de ces putains de fermes avant.
Je vais pas te laisser ici.
T'as dit que t'allais
revenir, tu te souviens ?
Je vais m'accrocher à ça.
Je reviendrai.
Je l'ai dit.
Je le pensais vraiment.
Ouais, ok.
Reste en vie.
Rentrons à la maison.

LES CYLONS FURENT
CRÉÉS PAR L'HOMME
ILS ÉVOLUÈRENT
ILS SE RÉVOLTÈRENT
IL Y A DE NOMBREUSES COPIES
ET ILS ONT UN PLAN.
Précédemment dans
Battlestar Galactica...
Au plus profond de ce que vous appelez
un subconscient, vous savez
combien de Cylons
reste-t-il dans la flotte ?
Huit ! Ils sont huit !
Le Caporal Verner signale
que l'ex-Présidente a disparu.
- Disparu ?
- Deux hommes à terre, la cellule est vide.
Merde...
Heureux de vous voir,
Mme la Présidente.
Et bien M. Zarek, il semblerait
que l'ennemi de mon ennemi soit mon ami.
Va trouver la Terre.
On rentre à la maison.
Nous avons trouvé Kobol.
Et quand nous aurons
retrouvé la Flèche,
nous ouvrirons
la tombe d'Athéna
et nous trouverons
le chemin de la Terre.
Personne ne va croire ces conneries.
Et s'il y en a qui veulent faire une fuite
suicidaire vers Kobol... Laissez-les faire.
L'Astral Queen a sauté.
24 vaisseaux, Monsieur.
C'est presque un tiers de la flotte.
Ils vont suivre Roslin sur Kobol...
vers leur mort.
18 000 personnes
à bord des 24 vaisseaux
ont rejoint la rebellion
de Roslin, Monsieur.
C'est au moins le tiers
de la population de la flotte.
Donnez moi un bilan.
Qu'avons nous perdu ?
9 500 âmes de Geminon.
6 250 de Caprica.
Pas qui...
Quoi.
Les personnes qui ont décidé
de rejoindre une fanatique religieuse
et un terroriste
ne m'interessent pas.
C'est leur problème.
Alors, qu'avons-nous perdu ?
12 transports civils, 7 de matériel,
et 3 plate-formes de construction.
Un croiseur privé,
et un vaisseau minier, Monsieur.
Le Monarch, c'est un sale coup.
On ne peut se permettre de perdre des
vaisseaux miniers dans notre situation.
Et puis, il y a les
dommages collatéraux.
Le moral de la flotte
est au plus bas.
La presse devient hystérique.
Des familles sont séparées.
Ne me parle pas de famille.
Je soutiens complètement la Présidente.
Et mes seules priorités...
sont la préservation de sa sécurité
et l'accomplissement de cette mission.
Tout cela est très bien,
mais il reste le fils d'Adama.
Quand les choses iront plus loin,
comment savoir s'il décidera d'y faire face...
S'il n'avait pas été là, je serais
toujours dans une cellule sur le Galactica.
Je lui fait complètement confiance
et ce sujet est clos.
Et qu'en est-il du Galactica ?
Ils savent où nous sommes !
Ils peuvent sauter ici à tout moment
et tous nous accuser de trahison...
ou détruire ce vaisseau
en un clin d'oeil.
Nous ne sommes pas
complètement sans défense !
Certains de nos vaisseaux sont armés !
Nous devrions commencer
à armer les autres, juste au cas où.
Juste au cas où
nous voudrions nous suicider !
Si le Galactica veut nous abattre,
nous ne pourrons rien
faire contre ça, rien.
Et personne dans cette pièce
ne devrait se faire
d'illusions à ce sujet.
Pour l'instant, je suis persuadée que
le Cmd. Adama nous a laissé partir.
Le Lieutenant Thrace...
va revenir.
Elle aura la Flèche d'Apollo.
Et celle-ci nous aidera à trouver
notre chemin vers la Terre.
Et combien de temps exactement
devons-nous l'attendre ?
Peut-être devrions nous
descendre maintenant sur Kobol.
Descendre maintenant et
chercher cette tombe.
Je ne serais pas trop pressé.
Il doit encore rester des Cylons.
Et certains d'entre nous
vont mourir là-bas.
Les Écritures nous disent que
chaque retour sur Kobol...
s'accompagne d'un prix
en sang.
Messieurs dames,
Je réalise qu'il reste encore de
nombreuses questions sans réponses ici.
Mais je refuse de perdre de vue
ce dont il a toujours été question :
sauver l'Humanité.
Oui, c'est une grande mission.
Mais telle est notre destinée,
et en ce qui me concerne...
Je ne vais pas me mettre à hésiter.
S'il y a quelqu'un ici
qui n'a pas les tripes
pour cette mission
vous êtes libres de rejoindre
la flotte du Commandant Adama.
C'est apparu sur le dradis,
il y a environ 2 minutes.
Aucun signal colonial, c'est trop gros
pour être le Raider de Thrace.
Pas de réponses à nos appels ?
Que dalle, Tom.
C'est soit un vaisseau cylon,
soit un Raptor du Galactica.
Dans tous les cas, nous devrions
tirer d'abord, parler après.
D'accord.
Il est a portée de tir
des missiles de l'Adriatic.
Tom, ce truc avance vite.
Si on doit le descendre,
on devrait le descendre maintenant !
Descendre quoi ?
Dois-je me répéter ?
Mme la Présidente, nous avons
un problème de sécurité, c'est tout.
Elle ne vous parlait pas.
Il y a un vaisseau non identifié
qui se dirige vers nous.
Trop gros pour être
le Raider du Lt. Thrace.
Il est à porté de tir. L'Adriatic doit
lancer ses missiles maintenant.
Nous devons prendre une décision,
Mme la Présidente.
<i>Vaisseaux civils, vaisseaux civils,
ici Starbuck.</i>
<i>Vous me recevez ?</i>
<i>Vous me recevez ?
Je répète, ici Starbuck.</i>
<i>Est-ce que quelqu'un m'entend ?</i>
<i>Allô...</i>
<i>Allô...</i>
<i>Arrimage engagé.</i>
C'est bon de vous revoir aussi,
Capitaine.
Rappelle-moi de t'envoyer
en cellule plus tard.
Lieutenant.
Lee, il y a quelque chose
que je dois te dire.
Lee, attends !
Putain, ne bouge pas !
Arrête !
Elle est avec nous !
Lâchez votre arme, Monsieur.
Lâchez votre arme.
Helo !

Messieurs, je ne le répèterai pas.
Capitaine Adama, et...
quel est votre nom ?
- Lieutenant Agathon.
- C'était l'ECO de Sharon.
Je pensais que tu étais mort, Helo.
T'es un Cylon aussi ?
- Ne...
- Voila ce que nous allons faire.
Vous allez baisser vos armes.
Ai-je été assez claire ?
Et pour Sharon ?
Elle va être placée en cellule de détention
où on ne lui fera aucun mal.
Ok.
Qu'en pensez-vous Apollo ?
Devons-nous faire ce que dit la gentille dame ?
C'est la Présidente des Colonies, crétin.
Et oui,
nous allons faire exactement ce qu'elle dit.
Baissez vos armes...
maintenant.
Merci.
Maintenant, jetez
cette chose dans l'espace.
- Quoi ?
- Nous ne gardons pas de Cylons ici, Lt.
C'est quoi ce bordel ?! Vous avez dit
que vous ne lui feriez pas de mal !
Helo ! Écoute moi !
Une de ces choses a tiré deux balles...
dans la poitrine de mon père.
- Ce n'était pas moi !
- On a tiré sur Adama ?!
Oui.
Tu as raté quelques catastrophes
quand tu étais partie.
- S'il te plaît dis-moi qu'il est en vie.
- Oui.
Après deux opérations d'urgence,
Cottle a fini par le sauver.
Ce n'était pas moi !
Kara !
Pour l'amour des Dieux !
Sharon... Cette Sharon
nous a sauvé la vie sur Caprica.
Dis-leur !
Dis-leur !
Je sais où trouver la tombe d'Athéna !
Et vous ?
Kobol est une grande planète !
Sans trouver la tombe,
vous ne trouverez pas la Terre !
Écoutez-la, pour l'amour des Dieux !
Écoutez-moi !
Madame la Présidente...
- Dites leur d'attendre une minute.
- Oui, madame.
Merci.
M. Zarek,
y a-t-il un endroit où cette...
jeune femme et moi, pouvons parler ?
Je peux arranger ça.
C'est bon de te revoir, Kara.
Merci de ramener les ordures.
On dirait qu'on arrive après la fête.
Perry ?
Non.
Mueller...
Mueller n'est pas un mauvais choix.
Il a fait un essai en tant que
XO d'un escadron.
Mueller est un contestataire.
Je sais que tu ne veux pas l'entendre mais
il n'y a pas d'autre Apollo dans ce groupe,
et nous devons choisir un nouveau CAG.
Commandant Adama.
Lieutenant Birch,
entrez s'il vous plaît.
Merci d'être venu
dans un délai si bref.
C'est normal, monsieur.
Vous devez savoir qu'il y a eu
du changement dans la flotte.
Plusieurs de nos pilotes sont partis.
J'étais en train de penser que
nous devons nommer un nouveau CAG.
Absolument, monsieur.
A qui pensez-vous ?
Félicitations, Capitaine.
C'est vous.
Merci, monsieur.
Sachez que vous avez tout mon soutien
et celui de tout l'équipage.
N'est-ce pas, Colonel ?
- Absolument.
- Prenez votre journal de bord.
Félicitations.
Je suis honoré, Commandant.
Je ne vous décevrai pas.
Et Cmd. je voulais vous dire que
j'étais un grand partisan de votre fils,
le Capitaine Adama.
C'était... C'était un grand chef, monsieur.
Un vaisseau, c'est une famille.
Il marche à la confiance,
la compréhension, et l'amour.
J'aime chaque personne sur ce vaisseau
autant que j'aime mon f...
mes fils.
Le Galactica est toujours une famille.
Vous êtes une part importante
de cette famille. Vous comprenez ?
Oui, monsieur.
Merci, George.
Je suis sûr que vous ferez du bon boulot.
C'est quoi ce...? Tu me laisses
ruminer le choix d'un nouveau CAG,
et tu avais déjà fait ton choix.
Je voulais voir si nous étions
sur la même longueur d'onde.
Pardon ?!
- Je suppose que non.
- Bien supposé.
Tu vas me dire que
ce gamin a l'étoffe d'un chef ?
Nous avons très peu de choix.
C'est le meilleur.
C'est un bon élément, Saul.
Il est honnête et il est loyal.
On a un peu besoin de ça
en ce moment, par ici.
C'est ton choix.
Je le soutiendrai.
Commandant.
Commandant Adama !
Commandant, que pouvez-vous nous dire
concernant la séparation de la flotte ?
Cmt. allez-vous répondre aux questions
sur la séparation de la flotte ?
Avez-vous des commentaires à faire
à propos de Laura Roslin
et de vos sentiments
sur la séparation ?
Ce truc fonctionne ?
S'il vous plaît, asseyez-vous.
- Commandant...
- Allez-vous répondre...
Permettez-moi de
faire une déclaration,
Permettez-moi de faire une
déclaration. Asseyez-vous, je vous prie.
Merci beaucoup.
Si vous ne le savez pas encore,
la flotte s'est divisée.
Attendez.
Attendez !
Nous partageons la peine
d'avoir perdu des amis.
Et les ressources que
nous avons sacrifiées
présentent de nouveaux
défis pour nous tous.
Mais si nous restons unis,
nous nous montrerons à la hauteur
comme nous l'avons déjà fait.
Des questions ?
Oui.
Vous connaissez les coordonnées où se
trouve la rebellion de la présidente Roslin.
Avez-vous l'intention de réunir la flotte ?
Avant tout,
Laura Roslin n'est plus présidente.
Elle a renoncé à ce poste
lorsqu'elle a fomenté une mutinerie
à bord de ce vaisseau.
Question suivante.
Mais Commandant !
- Commandant !
- Oui, allez-y.
- Depuis notre séparation...
- Commandant.
Vous n'avez pas encore
répondu à ma question.
Nous n'avons perdu personne qui ne puisse
être remplacé par quelqu'un de loyal...
qui aurait choisi de rester
avec nous.
Ceci est la flotte.
Merci.
Commandant ?!
Commandant !
Commandant, la rumeur
est-elle vraie, selon laquelle
il n'y aurait pas de Terre,
qu'elle n'existe pas et que
vous auriez tout inventé ?
C'est quoi ces foutues questions ?
C'est partout à la radio, dans les
bulletins d'information et le courrier.
La liberté de la presse n'est pas
un permis de calomnier.
Diffuser ce genre de foutaises est la façon
la plus rapide de se retrouver en cellule.
- C'est valable pour tout le monde.
- C'est fini.
Qu'est-il arrivé à la liberté de penser,
Commandant ?
Enlève tes mains.
Pourquoi tu ne te calmes pas ?
Rappelle-moi de ne plus refaire ça.
Ça semblait assez facile
quand Roslin le faisait.
Il y avait une vieille passerelle...
sur la rivière Euclide.
J'y allais souvent
quand j'étais gamin.
Regarder les poissons essayer
de nager à contre-courant.
Ils étaient fascinants.
Je les enviais.
Inconscients des...
grandes complexités,
et des défis de la vie.
Tu commences à voir les
êtres humains comme nous les voyons.
Ce que je commence à voir,
ce sont des visages cylons.
Partout où je regarde.
Sharon m'a dit qu'il y avait
encore 8 Cylons dans la flotte.
Pourquoi n'ai-je pas
demandé qui ils étaient ?
Si cette idiote
ne l'avait pas descendue.
Et pourquoi quand les choses
vont mal, elles vont aussi mal ?
Gaius, ne te mets pas
dans un tel état à propos de ça.
Ils se la coulent douce, n'est-ce pas ?
"Ils"...
Pourquoi me parles-tu comme si
je n'étais pas l'un d'entre eux ?
D'une certaine façon,
tu ne l'as jamais été.
Ta voie est tracée,
leur destin te sera épargné.
Pour une fois Gaius, tu peux
arrêter de manipuler le monde,
et laisser le destin s'accomplir.
S'il y a bien quelque chose
de certain sur les humains...
C'est qu'ils sont maîtres
dans l'art de l'auto-destruction.
Parce que je l'aime.
Et que je porte son enfant.
Oh, je vois. Cela explique tout.
Vous n'êtes pas là
pour nous détruire,
ou parce que vous êtes programmé
comme ennemi de l'humanité.
Vous êtes ici à cause d'une liaison
avec l'un de nos pilotes de Raptor.
- Écoutez-moi.
- Je vous écoute !
C'est là mon erreur.
J'écoute un Cylon.
Je suis venue ici par choix,
et je sais que vous ne me croyez pas.
Mais écoutez ceci...
Même si vous trouvez la tombe,
même si vous trouvez la carte,
et le chemin vers la Terre,
le prix à payer sera trop élévé.
Vos prophéties ne m'intéressent pas.
Je sais que les Cylons
nous attendent sur Kobol.
Je sais que c'est dangereux.
Et je suis presque sûre
que vous retransmettez mes paroles
en cet instant même.
Ça ne marche pas comme ça !
Je n'ai pas de micro !
Sharon...
C'est simple.
Ce que je veux savoir,
et ce qui vous permettra peut-être
de rester en vie,
c'est l'emplacement exact
de la tombe d'Athéna.
Donnez-moi une carte.
Et je ferai de mon mieux
pour vous indiquer le chemin.
Non, vous devrez faire mieux que cela.
Je veux connaître l'emplacement.
Vous le savez, ou vous ne le savez pas.
Nous connaissons tous l'emplacement.
Je peux vous montrer le chemin.
Je ne sais pas sa longueur
ni où il mène,
mais je peux vous dire que vous devrez
vous déplacer très très rapidement.
Elle dit aimer le Lt. Agathon.
Elle dit aimer le bébé qu'elle porte.
On en a rien à faire de ce qu'elle dit.
On ne peut croire un traître mot...
Les Écritures de la Pythie
mentionnent un démon inférieur
qui aide le peuple
en temps de crise.
Encore des superstitions.
Je lui ai dit
que si nous revenions de Kobol
sans un itinéraire vers la Terre,
le Lt. Agathon serait éjecté dans l'espace
en tant que conspirateur cylon.
C'est la vérité ?
Aucune importance. Elle y a cru.
Elle les a sauvés, tous les deux.
Elle n'était pas obligée.
Elle aurait pu avoir son enfant
et les laisser mourir.
Elle ne l'a pas fait.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que je crois qu'elle dit
la vérité sur un point.
Elle croit être amoureuse.
Même si c'est un programme
au lieu d'une émotion,
c'est la vérité pour elle.
Elle veut que son bébé vive.
Elle veut qu'Agathon vive.
Profitons-en.
Je ne pensais pas
que ça se passerait comme ça.
Je savais qu'ils seraient
suspicieux mais...
Ils sont humains.
Vous êtes ainsi.
Quelqu'un a-t-il envisagé
que Sharon en sait autant sur Kobol
parce que c'est un piège cylon ?
J'ai fait plus que l'envisager.
Un piège est clairement possible.
Le Capt. Apollo nous a déja prévenu
que des rencontres avec des Cylons
sont probables.
Le Capt. Apollo nous a-t-il dit
quelque chose qu'on ne sache déjà ?
Il est le responsable de cette mission,
et le commandant en second, après moi.
Je vous conseille
de vous en souvenir, M. Meier.
Quels qu'en soient les risques,
quelles qu'en soient les conséquences,
je partirai quand même.
J'en prends l'engagement.
<i>Capt. Birch, ici Galactica.</i>
<i>Vous avez l'autorisation
pour les manoeuvres de tir. Confirmez.</i>
<i>Galactica, ici leader. Confirmé.</i>
<i>CAG à tous les Vipers. Début de l'exercice
de tir de précision comme prévu.</i>
<i>Hotdog, tu es le premier.
Kat, tu passes ensuite.</i>
EXERCICE DE PILOTAGE
TIR SUR ASTEROÏDE
<i>Leader, ici Hotdog. Cible dégagée.</i>
<i>Tir en manuel dans trois...</i>
Deux ! Un !
Feu !
<i>Frack ! Frôlé !</i>
<i>Allez, les gars !
C'est qu'un exercice,</i>
<i>mais soyez sérieux.</i>
Hotdog, tu peux faire beaucoup mieux.
Recommence.
Voyons voir si le prochain sera
dans le mille.
Dégagé !
Prêt pour un second round.
Leader, Kat. Demande
de confirmation pour ma salve.
Confirmé ?
Tir en manuel engagé.
- Affirmatif, vous avez l'autorisation.
- C'est parti ! Missiles prêts.
<i>Leader, Kat.
Vous avez bien dit autorisation ?</i>
<i>Oui, j'ai dit autorisation.</i>
OK ! Roger !
C'est parti !
Dans trois...
Deux...
Un... Feu !
<i>Leader, début du mitraillage.</i>
Kat, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- T'as donné l'autorisation pour la salve !
- Hotdog a l'autorisation pour sa salve !
- Quoi ? Hotdog ?
- Dégage, Kat !
Maintenant !
Par tous les Dieux !
Boom ! En plein dedans !
Tu as vu ça ?
En plein dedans ?
Hotdog, espèce de con !
<i>T'as failli me descendre !</i>
<i>- De quoi tu parles ?
- Birch ! T'as dit que c'était OK !</i>
<i>A tous les Vipers, ici leader.
Je répète. A tous les Vipers, ici leader.</i>
<i>Retour sur le Galactica.
Retour...</i>
sur le Galactica.
Frack !
Je sais ce que tu ressens.
Je le comprends.
Mais ce n'est pas moi
qui lui ait tiré dessus.
Vous êtes tous pareil.
Tu ne sais pas de quoi tu parles.
Alors peut-être que j'ai fini de parler.
Je crois qu'on a eu notre compte
pour la journée.
Tu es mal placée
pour me dire quoi faire.
Après ta petite escapade.
Voler le Raider cylon
pour retourner sur Caprica ?
Parce que t'es un exemple
de discipline militaire, toi ?
Tu sais quoi ?
Tu n'as aucune idée
de ce qu'il m'est arrivée sur Caprica.
Pendant que t'es ici
à te faire briller l'aura,
dis-toi un instant
que t'as aucune putain d'idée
de quoi tu parles.
Capitaine.
Ce que fait Roslin est imprudent.
On a notre propre flotte, combien de temps
on va encore jouer à "suivez le leader" ?
On a une flotte car les gens croient
que Roslin va les guider jusqu'à la Terre.
C'est une imposture.
Tu n'y crois pas, non ?
Non, mais je crois au pouvoir des mythes.
Ça m'intéresse pas plus que toi
de risquer nos vies, mais
personne ne la dissuadera.
Finalement, Présidente ou prophète,
ça ne change rien.
Elle a toujours besoin d'un commandant.
Un homme à la tête de la flotte.
Celui qui a les armes fait les règles.
Et si elle décide que
tu n'es pas celui-là ?
Si elle avait quelqu'un d'autre en vue ?
Quelqu'un déjà proche d'elle.
Comme un certain Capitaine.
Imaginons que t'aies raison.
Que d'une certaine façon,
basée sur la croyance des Écritures,
la flotte a besoin de Laura Roslin
pour rester unie.
Donc on fait ce qu'on a à faire pour garder
Roslin en sécurité à la surface de Kobol.
Mais...
Mais...
Tu as raison.
Tu as parfaitement raison.
Comment j'ai pu passer à côté de ça ?
Je veux mettre cette flotte
- sur la voie de la liberté.
- Bien sûr.
Je veux leur offrir la liberté
qu'on leur a promise.
On est encore loin de la fin, mon ami.
Les Écritures disent que certains
d'entre nous mourront sur Kobol.
Un homme en particulier.
<i>Tanker, ici Striker, votre approche est
décentrée sur la gauche.</i>
Ici Striker, réinitialisez votre delta
à 0.35, confirmez.
<i>- Striker, comment est ma vitesse d'approche ?
- Tanker, vos vecteurs angulaires</i>
<i>sont trop raides. Ajustez.</i>
<i>Je répète, vos vecteurs sont trop raides.
Ajustez.</i>
Qu'est-ce qu'il fait ?
Dites-lui de réduire sa vitesse.
- C'est quoi cette fois ?
- Je suis content que vous soyez là.
Birch coordonne le ravitaillement,
mais il fait un foutoir de ce qui devrait
être la manoeuvre la plus simple du manuel.
Il y est depuis combien de temps ?
A peu près depuis 4 heures, maintenant.
Il est trop inexperimenté.
Il massacre l'approche
et les vitesses d'arrimage.
Il rate les couloirs d'approche,
il mélange les lignes. C'est le bordel.
- Vous savez, ce n'est pas la première fois.
- Oui, je sais.
Je comprends que c'est votre gars...
Mais ce n'est pas Apollo.
Je me demandais quand on pourrait
enfin... se détendre un peu par ici.
Oh, enfin.
Je peux avoir ma balle ?
Quoi, je peux pas la garder ?
Je peux avoir ma balle, s'il te plaît ?
Où est-ce que t'as eu une
balle de pyramide d'ailleurs ?
À Caprica.
Je peux avoir ma balle, Lee ?
Ouais, bien sûr.
Lee ?
Garde-la.
Allez Kara, pour l'amour des Dieux,
je déconnais...
Très bien, voilà, elle est à toi.
Tu peux prendre ta balle
et rentrer à la maison.
C'est complètement
stupide de toute façon.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas, Kara ?
Tu veux en parler ?
Nan.
Ça a dû être dur,
être de retour sur Caprica.
Être à la maison.
T'as dû voir des
trucs rudes là-bas.
De toute façon, tout sera fini demain.
D'une façon ou d'une autre.
On trouve la tombe, ou pas.
On trouve le chemin de la Terre, ou pas.
Je veux juste que tu saches Kara,
je suis ton ami. Je t'aime.
Si tu veux parler de n'importe quoi,
si tu veux te soulager, alors
je suis là pour toi.
Enfin, bref...
Quand tu voudra parler,
fais-le moi savoir.
C'était quoi le milieu déjà ?
Comment ça ?
Est-ce que tu as dit
que tu m'aimais ?
- Et bien...
- Lee Adama m'aime.
Non, je voulais dire...
Non, sérieusement,
très mignon. Tu m'aimes.
Non, tu m'aimes.
Tu peux pas te rétracter.
On ne se retracte pas.
Tu rêves, Kara.
- Tu m'aimes.
- Tu rêves.
- Tu m'aimes
- Rêveuse.
OK.
<i>Ici Striker. J'ai du mal à avoir un
visuel sur la barre de ravitaillement.</i>
<i>Pouvez-vous me diriger ?</i>
Ravitailleur,
Striker arrive trop dangereusement.
<i>Il faut reculer votre delta, maintenant.</i>
<i>Reçu, gardons l'angle d'attaque.</i>
<i>Vous n'entendez pas ? Reculez votre delta.
Vous êtes trop près ! Vous m'entendez ?</i>
<i>- On n'est pas trop près.
- OK.</i>
Annulez !
Annulez l'opération.
Rappelez les vaisseaux.
Ici Galactica. Que tout vaisseau impliqué
dans le ravitaillement annule sa mission.
Je répète, annulez le ravitaillement.
Les Raptors retournent à la base.
Confirmez.
<i>Compris Galactica. Annulons mission.</i>
Et merde !
<i>Compris. Galactica dit d'annuler l'approche.</i>
<i>Inversons vecteurs angulaires.</i>
Striker, vous êtes toujours sur
une trajectoire de collision.
<i>Mettez votre barre à gauche toute,
propulseurs inversés.</i>
<i>Reculez, reculez !</i>
Attention !
<i>Galactica, ici Emmitt.</i>
<i>Le tanker est intact.</i>
<i>Pas de contact radio mais il est en rotation
latérale. Il y a des dégâts apparents.</i>
Envoyez une équipe de secours.
Dîtes leur d'aborder le tanker
et de restaurer la navigation.
<i>Envoyez les équipes de
secours au secteur 0-4-6.</i>
PRAIRIE DU GALION - KOBOL
Tenez.
Vous ne savez jamais si vous
devrez vous défendre.
Voilà.
"Et les flammes les poursuivirent.
"Et le peuple de Kobol eut un choix,
monter à bord du Grand Vaisseau
"ou prendre la grande route
à travers les crêtes rocheuses...
"et le corps de chaque chef de tribu
fut offert aux Dieux,
"dans la tombe d'Athéna."
Oui, c'est cela.
Et le Grand Vaisseau était le Galion
qui partit d'où nous nous trouvons.
"Et il emmena les
fondateurs des 13 Colonies
"vers leur destinée.
"Et ceux qui ne montèrent pas à bord
du Gallion, prirent la haute-route...
"La crête rocheuse
qui menait à la tombe."
On y va.
Le chemin est censé être
balisé de pierres tombales.
Il y a quelque chose là-bas.
Attendez !
Reculez ! Reculez !
Sharon !
Sharon, mets-toi à couvert !
On échange.
- Joli.
- Chargeur.
Tiens.
Lee, non !
Merde.
Dites-moi que je rêve.
Pas mal.
Putain.
C'est intéressant.
La trahison a une telle
emprise sur l'esprit.
C'est presque comme un python.
Elle peut étrangler
toutes les autres pensées.
Étouffer toutes les
autres émotions jusqu'à...
ce qu'il ne reste que la rage.
Je ne parle pas de colère.
Je parle de rage.
Je peux la sentir.
Juste là.
Comme si elle allait exploser.
Comme si j'allais crier.
A cet instant même, d'ailleurs.
Puis-je parler ?
Dites ce que vous pensez, Dee.
Je ne pense pas que le
problème soit la trahison.
Je crois plutôt que vous
vous sentez impuissant.
On vous a tiré dessus,
vous avez été blessé.
Vous ne pouviez rien y faire.
Ne me trouvez pas d'excuses.
Et quand vous avez
enfin eu la chance
- de faire quelque chose...
- Désolé d'avoir fait ça.
Vous nous avez laissés tomber.
Vous nous avez laissés tomber.
Vous aviez fait une promesse.
À nous tous.
De trouver la Terre.
De nous trouver un foyer.
Ensemble.
Peu importe ce que
la Présidente a fait.
Ni même ce que Lee a fait,
parce que chaque jour
où nous sommes séparés
est un jour où vous n'avez
pas tenu votre promesse.
Les gens à bord de ces vaisseaux
ont pris leurs propres décisions.
Les leurs, pas les miennes.
Merci, Second Maître.
Vous pouvez partir.
Vous avez demandé à me parler, Monsieur...
Peut-être pensiez-vous
que je n'avais rien à dire.
Mais en fait si.
Il est temps de guérir les blessures, Cmd.
Les gens ont été divisés...
- J'ai dit que ça suffisait.
- Les enfants séparés de leurs parents.
Le prix du sang.
Allons-y, Mme la Présidente.
M. Gaeta.
Je veux toutes les
données de reconnaissance
sur Kobol dans mes quartiers.
Bien, Monsieur.
Kobol ?
Oui.
Je vais réunir la flotte.
Je vais réunir nos familles.
Ceci se termine maintenant.

LES CYLONS FURENT CREES PAR L'HOMME
ILS ÉVOLUÈRENT
ILS SE RÉVOLTÈRENT
IL Y A DE NOMBREUSES COPIES
ET ILS ONT UN PLAN.
Précédemment dans Battlestar Galactica.
24 vaisseaux ont sauté.
C'est au moins le tiers de la flotte.
Ils vont suivre
Roslin sur Kobol...
vers leur mort.
Cally a tiré sur Sharon !
Il y a de nombreuses copies.
Tu la verras encore.
Une de ces choses
a tiré deux balles dans
la poitrine de mon père.
Nous avons trouvé Kobol.
Et quand nous aurons retrouvé la Flèche,
nous ouvrirons la tombe d'Athéna
et nous trouverons
le chemin de la Terre.
Ce que je veux savoir,
c'est l'emplacement exact
de la tombe d'Athéna.
Je peux vous montrer le chemin.
Je ne sais pas sa longueur
ni où il mène,
mais je peux vous dire que vous devrez
vous déplacer très rapidement.
Je veux toutes les données de reconnaissance
sur Kobol dans mes quartiers.
Kobol ?
Je vais réunir la flotte.
Je vais réunir notre famille.
Les Écritures disent
que certains d'entre nous
mourront sur Kobol.
Comme par exemple,
un certain Capitaine Apollo.
Cela pourrait être n'importe où.
Si nous ne regardons que les informations
contenues dans le livre de la Pythie,
ce qui semble logique
étant donné que la Présidente a été
identifiée dans cet évangile précis,
alors la tombe d'Athéna
est très probablement
située quelque part...
dans les montagnes à l'ouest
de la Cité des Dieux.
Supposons qu'elle commence par le point
de repère le plus facile à identifier,
qui est l'Opéra.
Ils ont pu s'arrêter quelque part
par là, dans cette prairie,
puis se diriger vers l'ouest.
Est-ce que ça va ?
Oui.
Ça va...
Nous devons sortir
de ce ravin.
Je ne veux pas que nous soyons pris
dans une inondation.
Raptor 1...
s'est crashé... à peu près là
juste en dehors des ruines de la Cité.
Nous ne sommes jamais allés
plus loin que, voyons...
ici.
Mais nous avons observé
les routes menant aux montagnes.
- Merci.
- Pas de quoi.
Si c'est tout ce qu'elle a pour avancer,
je ne sais pas comment cette femme
pourrait trouver la tombe.
Peut-être l'a-t-elle vu dans une vision.
Je suis sérieux.
Elle dit qu'elle voit des choses.
Des images, des prophéties, peu importe.
Le fait est...
qu'elle y croit. Et il en est de même
pour ceux qui la suivent.
Sauf votre respect,
ce terrain est si accidenté, on ne peut
s'y déplacer sans une carte ou un guide.
Ok,
t'es le roi de la colline.
La reine de la colline,
merci beaucoup.
On devrait s'abriter
jusqu'à la fin de l'orage.
Ça me semble bien.
Et après ?
Ensuite, on attaque les choses sérieuses.
Allons-y.
La dernière équipe de sauvetage,
n'a rapporté aucun signe de Vaisseau-mère
ou de Raider près de Kobol.
Nous sauterons dans la partie
supérieure de l'atmosphère.
Juste au cas où.
Monsieur, c'est risqué.
Et probablement impossible
avec un vaisseau de cette taille.
Je vais descendre en Raptor.
Quoi ?
Je ne vais pas laisser
la flotte sans défense.
Et il est trop risqué
d'essayer de prendre tout le monde.
Bons Dieux, nous enverrons
une équipe de sauvetage !
"Et Zeus avertit les chefs
des douze tribus,
que chaque retour sur Kobol
exigerait un prix de sang"
C'est ce qui s'est passé pour nous.
Plus de carnage.
Assez de pertes.
Je n'emmène que ceux qui
sont absolument nécessaires.
N'essaye pas de discuter
avec moi, Saul.
En vérité...
je suis le seul
à pouvoir atteindre Roslin.
C'est entre nous deux depuis
le début de toute façon.
Peut-être y sommes-nous allés séparément,
mais nous reviendrons ensemble.
Avec un peu de chance, sur nos pieds.
Mais même si c'est dans des linceuls,
nous reviendrons ensemble.
Je vais contacter l'Astral Queen,
voir sils peuvent nous prendre
jusqu'à ce que le ciel se dégage.
Vous n'êtes pas le responsable ici, Tom.
Toutes les communications passent par moi.
Essayez de vous en souvenir.
Combien de temps tu vas
encore attendre, Tom ?
Garde juste les yeux sur lui.
47 855 survivants
A la recherche d'un foyer
Appelé la Terre.
A onze heures.
20 degrés plus haut.
Il y a une formation
de rochers jumeaux juste au-dessus.
Oui je les vois.
Je pense que ce sont les Portes de Héra.
Tu penses ?
J'assemble les pièces d'un grand nombre
de sources en plus de vos Écritures.
Si j'ai raison,
c'est l'endroit où votre Déesse
s'est soi-disant tenue
et a regardé Athéna se jeter
de ces rochers
par désespoir après l'exode
des 13 tribus.
Soi-disant ?
- Je pensais que les Cylons croyaient aux Dieux.
- Ouais, ne la lance pas là-dessus.
Ils croient en un seul vrai Dieu
ou un truc comme ça.
Et nous ne vénérons pas de fausses idoles.
T'as accepté cette mission
plutôt rapidement.
Nous guider à une tombe
mentionnée réellement uniquement
dans nos fausses Écritures.
Nous en savons plus sur
votre religion que vous.
La tombe d'Athéna, qui qu'elle fut
et quoi qu'elle fut réellement
est probablement là-haut.
Ça, c'est vrai.
Madame la Présidente, nous n'arriverons
pas là-haut avant la tombée de la nuit.
Allons-y, voyons jusqu'où nous arrivons.
C'est un endroit déprimant.
Une partie de moi est heureux que Sharon
ne soit jamais arrivée jusqu'ici.
Tu as décidé d'éclairer
un peu la pièce, hein ?
Notre enfant va naître ici.
Dans cette pièce.
- Tu n'écoutes pas.
- Tu as remarqué ?
Non, j'en ai assez.
Tu crois vraiment que je vais t'écouter
alors que tu es assise là,
complètement nue,
à parler à n'en plus finir de
notre bébé mythique ?
Mythique ?
Oui, mythique. C'est...
Est-ce que tu te rends compte
à quel point tu es devenue ridicule ?
La tournure de nos conversations
part en pièces.
Je suis le père d'un bébé
qui sera de moi,
de ma femme imaginaire...
que je suis le seul à voir.
Ma femme imaginaire qui, au fait,
a arrêté d'être mon fantasme.
Tu n'es plus mon
fantasme.
Non, malheureusement, tu n'es
rien de plus...
qu'une vulgaire allumeuse.
Je n'ai jamais dit que j'allais
porter l'enfant.
Merveilleux.
Encore des sous-entendus,
des jeux d'esprit.
Alors, qui ça va être ?
Qui va mettre au monde notre
enfant secret ?
C'est pas Starbuck, non ?
Attention, Gaius.
Tu es en terrain dangereux désormais.
Regarde, je tremble de peur.
Tu vas me sortir quoi cette semaine ?
Ne dis rien, je vais deviner.
Le vaisseau va exploser !
Non ! Et merde.
Déjà fait.
Ça va donc être
quelqu'un d'autre, quelq....
Moi !
Mais bien sûr, moi !
Je vais exploser !
Dieu va me faire exploser
en une très grosse boule de feu.
Tout l'équipage pourra
célébrer ça à l'ambroisie.
Se bourrer la gueule.
OK.
Ça suffit. Je peux plus le faire.
T'as raison.
"Game over". Tu gagnes.
Je gagne ?
- J'ai gagné quoi ?
- Tu piges pas ?
Allez, Gaius.
Réveille-toi et sens la psychose,
maintenant.
Désolé, je sais pas de quoi tu parles.
OK.
Ecoute.
Il n'y a aucune puce cylon
implantée dans ton cerveau.
Je ne suis pas réelle.
Tu ne reçois aucun message
secret des Cylons.
T'es juste marteau.
A mourir de rire.
Hilarant.
Tu écris toi-même tes dialogues ?
- Tu me crois pas, hein ?
- Non, pas du tout.
Génial. J'adore !
Vraiment ? J'en ai marre là. D'accord ?
Donc arrêtons de jouer à
ce jeu stupide.
Oh, je suis désolée.
Mais c'est la vérité.
Il n'y a aucune puce.
S'il n'y a aucune puce,
alors qui...
ou quoi...
es-tu exactement ?
Je suis toi.
Je suis ton subconscient qui
mets le bordel dans ton esprit.
OK.
Réfléchis.
Tu as aidé les Cylons à commettre un
génocide contre ton propre peuple
et ton petit esprit fragile n'a pas pu
le supporter. Donc pouf...
J'apparais te disant
combien tu es spécial.
Que "Dieu t'a choisi".
Mais bien sûr...
Je ne sais plus à quoi tu joues.
Je n'aime pas ces jeux débiles.
Maintenant que tu t'es éclatée...
Pourquoi t'irais pas te faire examiner ?
Va à l'infirmerie faire un scan cérébral.
Ça réglerait le problème, non ?
Vas-y. Je te défie.
Mais c'est un jeu d'enfant.
OK, on est...
dans le continent nord nord-ouest,
quadrant C, secteur 2, ce qui...
Oh putain, laissez voir si je peux en
tirer quelque chose.
J'ai indiqué le terrain le mieux possible,
mais on n'est pas...
La topographie, c'est pour les tapettes
de toute façon.
Comment vous sentez-vous ?
D'humeur diplomate ?
Je pense toujours que l'idée est
mauvaise, Commandant.
A notre dernière rencontre,
je l'ai plutôt déçue.
Elle vous fait confiance,
donne de l'importance à vos conseils.
- Elle vous écoutera.
- J'en doute vraiment.
Je suis son assistant. Mes paroles
n'ont pas grande valeur pour elle...
Elle vous voit Président un jour.
Pardon ?
Elle me l'a dit une fois.
Que vous lui rappeliez le président Adar
quand il s'est présenté la première fois.
Je ne sais pas quoi répondre, Monsieur.
Que cela ne vous monte pas à la tête.
Adar était un con.
On entre dans l'atmosphère.
Vous êtes attachés ?
Ouais.
Le périmètre est dégagé. Pas de Cylons.
Voyez ?
Tout baigne.
On a déjà de la chance.
Ça me fout les jetons
de le voir...
se comporter ainsi avec elle.
Il l'aime.
Et il sait qu'elle est une machine.
Il s'en fout.
Il l'aime de toute façon.
Frak... Comment un des nôtres peut s'être
laissé embringuer par un des leurs ?
On devrait le surveiller aussi.
Helo est un ami à moi, d'accord ?
Il est avec les gentils.
Ah ouais ?
Sharon était aussi une amie à toi.
C'est comme si j'étais de
retour sur Caprica.
Non merci.
Je suis bien ici.
Vraiment ?
Oui absolument.
Être avec toi et Kara, c'est comme
si je revenais chez moi.
De retour dans la flotte.
Mais tu n'y as jamais été.
C'était l'autre Sharon.
Bien sûr, je le sais.
Mais je me rappelle de tout.
La remise des diplômes.
Mon premier voyage à bord du Galactica.
Tu sais, le souvenir d'être...
en uniforme
est si fort, si puissant,
c'est comme si...
J'étais Sharon Valerii et vous ma famille.
- C'est assez bizarre, non ?
- Ça me dérange pas.
J'aime bien le bizarre.
Perdre la prêtresse l'a vraiment
foutue en l'air.
Elle a perdu de nombreuses personnes.
Des amis.
Des partisans.
Tout ce qui lui reste
c'est son jeune prince.
On est ici.
Il est ici.
On sait ce qu'on doit faire.
Le terrain est plus dur
qu'on ne le pensait.
Je ne sais pas si la tombe
est encore loin.
Pourquoi tu te dérobes, là ?
Je me dérobe pas.
Se mettre du sang sur les mains est
plus difficile que de l'enlever.
Laisse la Cylon le faire.
Et si la Cylon trouvait une arme
et lui tirait dessus.
Il y aurait une grande confusion,
du stress, de la panique.
Et la Cylon pourrait se faire descendre
très facilement.
Et comment suggères-tu que ça arrive ?
Ça doit arriver, Tom.
Tu le sais bien.
Pas avant qu'on trouve la tombe.
- Ce sera encore long ?
- "Loin".
Quoi ?
"Loin" décrit une distance.
"Long" est plus figuratif.
Tu fais dictionnaire maintenant ?
Désolée d'être plus intelligente que toi.
C'est rien.
Le bébé peut avoir ton cerveau,
tant qu'il me ressemble.
Ah oui ?
Ça serait une vraie bénédiction pour elle.
Pour elle ?
Tu sais que c'est une fille ?
Oui.
D'après ce que j'ai vu,
les Cylons ont un plan pour Caprica.
Ils évacuent les corps.
Ils amènent des outils
pour réparer les infrastructures.
Je comprends.
Mais il y a des survivants.
Il y a un mouvement de résistance.
Une fois qu'on aura trouvé la tombe et
la carte, la première chose à faire
est d'organiser une mission de sauvetage
sur Caprica.
J'espère que vous savez combien
je vous suis reconnaissante
pour tout ce que vous avez fait et risqué
mais en ce moment je ne peux penser
à rien d'autre qu'à trouver la tombe.
Merci.
- Bien installé ?
- Peux pas parler.
Peux pas bouger.
Dans ce cas,
tu ne vas pas aimer que je fasse ça.
Frack ! Je vous ai dit de ne pas bouger.
Je suis vraiment désolé, Docteur.
Ça n'arrivera plus.
Super. Il faut que j'efface
et que je recommence.
Il va devoir effacer et recommencer.
Pourquoi me fais-tu ça ?
Allons Gaius. Même quand tu allais bien,
il y avait une petite voix dans ta tête.
Cette petite voix qui t'aidait dans
les moments difficiles, tu te souviens ?
Je suis la dernière version
de cette petite voix.
Je n'y crois pas un instant.
Non. Dieu a un plan pour moi.
Le plan de Dieu ?
Ben voyons...
Dieu a un plan...
Dieu existe et il parle à Gaius Baltar.
Ferme-la, veux-tu !
Vous arrêtez de faire le fou ?
Je ne suis pas fou.
Une fois la tombe trouvée,
vous savez qu'il vous fera tuer ?
Il n'est pas comme ça.
C'est un soldat, et vous l'ennemi.
Rien ne changera ça.
- Votre jumelle, copie, quoi que ce soit...
- Je sais.
L'autre Sharon a tiré sur le Commandant.
Je l'ai entendu mille fois.
Vous souvenez-vous d'avoir tiré ?
Ce n'était pas moi.
Vous vous en souvenez ?
Non.
Je vois.
Que lui est-il arrivé selon vous ?
Je ne sais pas.
Elle doit probablement
moisir dans une cellule.
Elle a été assassinée
par un des membres d'équipage,
et personne sur le Galactica
n'a rien fait pour l'arrêter.
Vous pensez que je mens ?
Demandez à Lee.
Ils ne laisseront pas naître votre enfant.
Vous croyez qu'ils vous laisseraient
élever un ennemi potentiel parmi eux ?
Si vous voulez partir d'ici vivante,
vous feriez bien de vous inquiéter un peu.
Starbuck.
Baissez-vous.
Baissez votre arme, Capitaine.
Commandant.
Je suis content de vous voir.
Madame la Présidente...
Billy...
Billy, vous n'imaginez pas...
ce que ça représente pour moi
de vous avoir ici.
Je suis content de vous revoir aussi.
Par les Dieux.
Commandant !
Elle est avec nous, Commandant.
<i>Pourquoi ?</i>
Commandant, non !
Laissez-moi !
Je veux que tu meures.
Commandant.
Commandant, non. On a besoin d'elle.
Commandant ?
- Commandant, vous devez la lâcher.
- Meurs !
Monsieur !
Papa ?
Vous vouliez savoir pourquoi ?
Rien... Rien...
Toujours rien.
Vous êtes content ?
Oui, absolument.
Merci beaucoup Docteur.
Nous sommes absolument certains
qu'il n'y a pas...
d'objets...
non identifiés ?
Vous pourrez les scruter autant que
vous voudrez sur votre temps libre.
Saloperie d'hypocondriaque.
Un sur chaque putain de vaisseau.
Vous avez gêné une opération militaire,
et vous n'avez pas tenu votre promesse.
C'est la deuxième partie
qui vous gêne, n'est-ce pas ?
Laura, je vous pardonne.
Merci, Bill.
Je n'ai pas demandé votre pardon.
Vous l'avez quand même.
Je peux pas croire que le patron
ait réagi ainsi.
Tu sais qu'ils ont tué l'autre Sharon ?
Quoi ?
De sang froid, sans même un procès.
Salut.
Salut.
Sharon ?
Bonjour, Chef.
Vous savez qui je suis.
Oui.
On ne s'est jamais vu, mais...
je me souviens de toi.
C'est bon de te voir.
Et maintenant ?
Retour à la case départ.
Sous le joug de la Présidente
Roslin et du Cmd. Adama.
Pas si on retourne au vaisseau
avec une carte pour la Terre.
Et une triste histoire sur les nombreuses
victimes des Cylons sur Kobol.
C'est fini.
Laisse tomber. Pour le moment.
Le Lt. Thrace dit qu'il y a des
survivants sur les Colonies.
Des gens qui se battent
contre les Cylons tous les jours.
Pour leur maison, leur futur.
Je vois.
Cela vous donne-t-il à réfléchir ?
Peut-être votre réflexe le jour
de l'attaque cylon était juste.
Peut-être aurions-nous dû rester
et nous battre pour nos foyers.
Peut-être la Présidente des Colonies
aurait-elle dû rester avec son peuple.
Je ne suis pas venu pour ça.
Je ne suis pas venu ici
pour faire de l'introspection
ou cataloguer nos erreurs.
Nous avons pris la décision de
quitter les Colonies après l'attaque.
Nous l'avons prise ensemble.
C'était la bonne sur le moment,
et encore maintenant.
Parce que chaque instant
de chaque jour depuis...
est un don.
Des Dieux.
Non, de vous.
Pour m'avoir convaincu de partir.
Je serais mort.
Mon fils serait mort.
Quelqu'en soit le prix...
Je ne discuterai pas ce résultat.
Je pense que c'est l'heure
d'aller chercher...
votre tombe.
Donc Cally tue Sharon...
et le patron lui colle 30 jours de cellule.
30 jours pour un meurtre.
Ils ne voient pas ça comme un meurtre,
Helo.
C'est ce que j'essaie de te dire.
C'est ce que tu ne comprends pas.
Pour lui, pour la Présidente,
pour tous,
les Cylons ne sont pas des gens.
Je ne suis pas une personne pour eux.
Je suis une chose.
Je ne resterai pas à rien faire
et les laisser te tuer
comme l'autre Sharon.
Ok ?
Je te crois, Helo.
Vraiment.
Mais si nous voulons avoir
un futur ensemble,
n'importe lequel...
Je vais devoir prendre les choses en mains.
De quoi est-ce que tu parles ?
Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?
Oui.
Est-ce que tu me fais confiance ?
Oui.
Alors ne me demande pas
ce que je dois faire.
Sharon, qu'est-ce que...
Fais-moi confiance.
Fais-nous confiance.
Vous avez pensé à notre conversation ?
- Je n'ai pensé qu'à ça.
- Et ?
Quand on arrivera à l'entrée,
ils seront distraits.
Je m'occupe du père,
occupez-vous du fils.
Vous devriez voir ça !
Lt. Thrace, j'espère que vous avez
cette flèche à portée de main.
Vous devez savoir quelque chose.
Je suis Sharon, mais une différente Sharon.
Je sais qui je suis.
Je n'ai pas de protocole caché,
ni de programme en attente d'activation.
Je fais mes propres choix,
mes propres décisions
et vous devez savoir que c'est mon choix.
C'est un vieux Stallion.
Pas un modèle militaire.
Où l'avez-vous eu ?
C'est le sien.
Du calme.
Je voulais juste...
que t'aies ton dû.
Tu ne m'as jamais écouté.
Y'a pas un manuel avec ce truc à la con ?
Surtout pas, ça serait
bien trop logique hein ?
"Et la Flèche d'Apollo
ouvrira la tombe d'Athéna."
Ouais, à moins que quelqu'un
ne voie une serrure...
Ou quoique ce soit...
Soit on est pas au bon endroit,
soit on est bien baisé.
Pourquoi on ne...
Helo, venez ici.
À trois. Un...
Deux... Trois...
- Ça bouge.
- Oh Dieux.
Après toi.
- Helo, restez dehors.
- Oui, Monsieur.
- Chef.
- Oui ?
Surveillez tout le monde.
Oui.
Si la flèche n'a pas ouvert la tombe,
comment on sait qu'on est au bon endroit ?
On ne le sait pas.
Mais c'est bien une tombe.
Les Écritures disent qu'on a besoin
de la flèche pour trouver la carte.
Ces statues en morceaux, je les reconnais.
Le bélier,
Aerilon.
Gemenon, les jumeaux.
Ce sont les symboles des 12 Tribus,
les 12 Colonies.
C'est vraiment ici que tout a commencé.
On vient tous d'ici.
Cela pourrait être Picon, le poisson.
J'imagine que cette jeune femme
doit être Virgon ?
La chèvre, Caprica.
Sagittaron,
l'archer.
Il lui manque quelque chose.
Mais où sommes-nous donc ?
Je ne sais pas.
Dans la tombe d'Athéna, je pense.
Je croyais qu'on était déjà dans la tombe.
Ça devait être l'entrée.
De nouveau les anciens symboles.
Ces motifs...
étaient sur le drapeau
original des 12 Colonies
à l'époque où les Colonies
portaient leur ancien nom.
Aries.
Taurus.
Gemini.
Cancer.
Leo.
Libra.
Virgo.
Les joyaux correspondent
aux constellations.
C'est la carte...
La carte vers la Terre.
Peut-être.
Alors la Terre
est-elle dans une de ces constellations ?
On est dessus.
On est sur Terre.
Les Écritures disent
que lorsque la 13éme Tribu
atterrit sur Terre,
ils regardèrent vers les cieux,
et virent leurs 12 frères.
La Terre est l'endroit
d'où on peut regarder le ciel
et voir les constellations
des douze Colonies.
Je ne vois pourtant pas
à quoi ça va nous avancer.
Qu'est-ce qu'on est censé faire ?
Chercher à travers toute...
la galaxie un motif d'étoiles précis ?
Là.
Dans Scorpio. J'ai déjà vu ça.
C'est la nébuleuse de la lagune.
Corps stellaire M8...
C'est bien loin d'ici.
Ouais.
Mais au moins maintenant nous avons...
une carte et une direction.
Nous avons lutté
depuis les attaques.
Dépendant les uns des autres.
Notre force,
et notre seul espoir en tant que peuple,
est de rester soudés.
Nous n'avons pas toujours fait
notre possible en ce sens.
Plusieurs d'entre nous
croient que les Écritures,
la parole des Dieux,
nous mèneront...
au salut.
Peut-être le feront-elles.
Mais "les Dieux élèveront l'âme de ceux
qui tentent d'élever celle des autres."
Et donc,
celle qui a élevé nos âmes,
laissez-moi vous présenter
une nouvelle fois
la Présidente des Colonies,
Laura Roslin.
<i>Je vais bien.</i>
<i>Je vais bien, vraiment.</i>
<i>Ouais.</i>
<i>C'est juste que...</i>
<i>j'ai pas envie que notre enfant
naisse dans cette cellule.</i>
Leur enfant ?
Je t'avais dis qu'un enfant arriverait.
Qu'il naîtrait dans cette pièce même.
Comment as-tu pu douter de moi ?
Boomer va porter...
notre enfant ?
Un honneur qu'elle mérite à peine, mais
on ne conteste pas la volonté de Dieu.
Tu n'es pas une puce.
Nous l'avons démontré.
Oui.
Le fait que Sharon soit
enceinte implique
que tu es bien plus qu'une simple
manifestation de mon subconscient.
Et que je ne suis pas...
Fou ?
Non.
Alors qui...
ou quoi...
es-tu,
exactement ?
Je suis un ange de Dieu
envoyé pour te protéger.
Pour te guider, et t'aimer.
À quelle fin ?
Celle de la race humaine.
Sous-titres : "Lords of Kobol"
Et merde !
J'envoie les Marines.
Dites-leur d'y aller et
de ramener le ravitaillement.
Reculez d'accord !
Nous sommes juste lŕ
pour le ravitaillement !
Éloignez-vous
et personne ne sera blessé.
Cessez le feu ! Cessez le feu !
Vous avez tiré sur des gens
parce quils jetaient du café ?
La foule était incontrôlable.
Quelqu'un a tiré, je ne sais pas qui.
C'est devenu l'enfer, c'était un accident.
Qu'attends-tu de moi, Helo ?
C'est un Cylon.
Je ne te laisserai pas la tuer, OK ?
Elle porte mon enfant.
Je vais bien, je t'assure.
Ouais...
Je ne veux pas que notre bébé
naisse dans cette cellule.
<i>Tout le monde, reculez, d'accord ?</i>
<i>Nous sommes juste lŕ pour
le ravitaillement ! Retenez-les !</i>
<i>Cessez le feu ! Cessez le feu !</i>
<i>Nous avons besoin
d'un médecin de suite !</i>
<i>Papa !</i>
<i>Papa ?</i>
<i>Oh Dieux !
Oh Dieux !</i>
<i>Cette séquence
récemment découverte,</i>
<i>de ce qu'on appelle maintenant
"Le Massacre du Gidéon",</i>
<i>semble montrer des soldats du Galactica,
faisant feu aveuglément</i>
<i>sur un groupe
de civils désarmés.</i>
<i>Quatre morts. Douze blessés.</i>
<i>Pourtant, jusqu'ŕ maintenant,
aucune charge n'a été retenue</i>
<i>contre les marines impliqués
ou leurs supérieurs.</i>
<i>C'était un reportage de D'Anna Biers.</i>
Ça va faire éclater cette histoire
au grand jour.
Il faudrait quelques plans
de marines déchaînés.
On pourrait les intercaler entre
les déclarations des témoins.
Vous n'avez pas le droit
d'entrer ici comme ça.
Madame, veuillez nous suivre.
Quoi, je suis en état d'arrestation ?
Non, Madame.
Et si je refuse de venir ?
Bonjour, Mlle Biers.
Heureuse de vous voir.
Bienvenue sur le Colonial One.
Mme la Présidente,
c'est un honneur.
Commandant Adama.
Oů avez-vous eu cette cassette ?
D'un patriote anonyme.
C'est une soirée mondaine ou
vous préparez un autre coup d'état ?
Trčs drôle.
Juste pour détendre l'atmosphčre.
Je présume que je suis ici
car vous ętes mécontents,
de mon reportage sur
"Le Massacre du Gidéon" ?
Ce qui s'est passé sur
le Gidéon fut une tragédie
mais pas un massacre.
La cassette montre pourtant vos hommes
tirant sur une foule de civils sans défense.
Mes soldats donnent une autre version.
Pas ŕ moi.
J'ai demandé une douzaine d'interviews,
toutes refusées.
C'est sur le point de changer.
Vous faites pression depuis des mois
pour faire un reportage sur le Galactica.
Le Commandant Adama
accepte de vous donner
un accčs total ŕ
son navire et équipage.
C'est bien cela.
Un accčs total.
Ce n'est pas pour autant
que je vous ferai de la propagande.
Nous n'en voulons pas.
Mlle Biers, votre cassette
a mis de l'huile sur des braises encore chaudes.
Les gens sont en colčre.
Ils se méfient des militaires.
Avec raison, Madame.
Parfois avec raison.
Mais je veux montrer aux gens ce qu'est
réellement la vie sur le Galactica.
Je veux mettre un visage humain
sur les officiers et l'équipage
qui nous protčgent des Cylons
et défendent notre liberté, chaque jour.
Vous pourriez ne pas
aimer ce visage.
Et pourquoi donc ?
Tout ce que nous voulons
est un reportage objectif.
Montrez-nous ce que sont réellement
les hommes et femmes du Galactica.
- C'est tout ?
- C'est tout.
Il faut que vous le fassiez maintenant,
avant que l'on s'entredéchire.
Le CAG devrait
botter quelques fesses.
La moitié des vols de
ravitaillement sont en retard.
Ici le CIC, Dualla.
Colonel, c'est votre femme.
Il y a un problčme.
Colonel.
Ellen, tu vas bien ?
Saul. Par tous les Dieux !
J'ai si peur.
"Des ténčbres, vous choirez."
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Saison 2 - Épisode 8
"LA DERNIČRE SÉQUENCE"
47 853 survivants
A la recherche d'un foyer
Appelé la
Terre.
Terre.
Sous-titres : "Lords of Kobol"
-=( www.seriestele.net )=-
Racetrack.
Oů avez-vous eu ça ?
Pardon M. des civils les ont
laissés aprčs un trajet.
Je pensais les jeter.
Non.
Mettez-les en lieu sűr.
Gardez-les précieusement.
Oui, Monsieur.
Vous filmez lŕ ?
Ça tourne depuis Colonial One.
La Présidente avait dit "accčs total".
Vous l'aurez.
Mais si un passage compromet
la sécurité du vaisseau,
ça sera coupé.
Le sifflement que vous entendez
est notre recyclage d'oxygčne.
On a une douzaine de
filtres ŕ CO2 ŕ bord.
Ils fonctionnent
24 heures sur 24.
- Zoome lŕ-dessus, s'il te plaît Bell.
- Oui, bien sűr...
On vient de finir
une patrouille de 15 heures.
Tu ferais bien de t'y faire.
On manquera de pilotes
tant que le reste de la flotte
ne se décidera pas ŕ se sortir
les doigts de son gros cul.
D'autres conséquences
de l'instant de gloire de Tigh ?
Tu as entendu parler
de sa menace de mort ?
N'importe quoi.
Lui qui est si sympa.
J'arrive pas ŕ croire qu'on ne
m'ait pas déjŕ interrogée.
Tu étais en tęte de liste.
Mais t'inquičte pas, j'ai dit ŕ Tigh que tu
ne reconnaîtrais pas la poésie capricane
męme s'il y en avait sur ton casque.
"Des ténčbres, vous choirez.
Misérables
et défaits,
jusqu'aux ténčbres absolues."
Kataris.
C'est pas ses meilleurs vers.
Je peux ętre ŕ nouveau suspectée ?
S'il te plaît.
La suite de notre itinéraire
est la cuisine de bord.
Les légumes et conserves sont stockés
dans les compartiments en titane,
pour assurer une fraîcheur maximum.
Je n'ai pas fait tout ce chemin
pour interviewer la soupe du jour.
Madame...
Voilŕ Tweedledum et Tweedledee.
- Hé, il y en a qui dorment.
- Ouais, moins de bruit.
- Pardon.
- Pčte un coup, Palladino.
Ça fonctionne ? Vous filmez ?
Salut maman !
Tu me manques, maman.
Ça, c'est pour mes potes du cargo 212.
Oui, c'est pour vous !
Kat !
Putain, tu crois faire quoi lŕ ?
Je passais juste le bonjour
ŕ mes potes de la flotte, Monsieur.
Et donc, tu leur parles
avec ton cul ?!
En quelque sorte.
Allez, habillez-vous !
- Oui, monsieur.
- Constanza, dégage d'ici.
C'est la derničre fois que tu entres
dans les quartiers des officiers. Dégage...
Vous devez ętre la journaliste
que nous attendions.
Ne vous habillez pas pour moi.
D'Anna Biers,
service de presse de la flotte.
Cpt. Lee Adama, commandant d'escadre.
Ça se prononce CAG.
Je vous suggčre de trouver
une sortie au plus vite.
Et ça se prononce APV.
Je pense qu'on a vu tout
ce qu'on voulait voir ici.
Qui a eu cette brillante idée ?
Comment a réagi votre famille ?
Mon pčre est devenu fou
quand je me suis engagée.
Il pensait que l'armée est une farce.
Un refuge pour perturbés émotionnels
et cinglés patriotes.
Mais vous vous ętes engagée quand męme.
J'imagine que je voulais
croire en quelque chose.
Et ça augmentera sa mémoire ?
Oui, ça a l'air assez simple.
Peut-ętre un réglage de base.
C'est un bel appareil.
Oui, c'est plutôt ancien...
Mais qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- Sais pas. Je suis le vice-président.
C'est moi qu'elle devrait
interviewer, non ?
Bien sűr.
Ton titre seul impose le respect.
Bien sűr. C'est une denrée rare
par ici. Je suis le vice-président.
Je ne quémanderai pas,
tu peux en ętre sűre.
Allons, Gaius,
tu devras peut-ętre quémander.
Tu dois faire le nécessaire
pour protéger notre enfant.
La politique n'est peut-ętre pas ton fort.
Mais cela nous sert en ce moment.
Fais-moi confiance.
Celle-ci peut nous aider.
M. le Vice-président ?
Bonjour.
Bonjour, D'Anna Biers,
service de presse de la flotte.
Vous ętes le reporter.
C'est vrai. Le Commandant Adama a dit
que la presse pourrait venir ici.
Je suppose que vous ętes...
trčs occupée ŕ faire vos interviews,
j'imagine.
Et bien...
J'adorerais vous parler. Si vous avez
2 minutes, on peut faire ça maintenant.
Non, non. Je crains que non.
Je suis...
trčs occupé.
Vraiment trčs occupé en ce moment,
submergé.
Mais si vous contactez
un de mes assistants,
on pourrait peut-ętre se voir demain.
Je ne promets rien, évidemment.
Mais je devrais pouvoir...
vous donner une interview,
si c'est ce que vous...
souhaitez.
- Bien.
- Bien, bien. Vous pouvez...
continuer.
Quel étrange petit homme.
Capitaine Adama, je vous reconnais ŕ peine
une fois habillé.
Écoutez, je suis sűr que vous avez
trouvé ça malin.
Votre descente dans
le vestiaire des pilotes. Mais...
l'accčs n'est pas interdit sans raison.
C'est le seul endroit oů mes hommes
peuvent décompresser
et ętre eux-męmes.
Vous avez l'air de penser que vos pilotes
méritent un traitement de faveur.
Effectivement, je le pense.
Comme tout le monde,
mes pilotes ont perdu leur famille,
leur amis...
tous ceux qu'ils aimaient.
En plus de ça, on leur demande
de risquer leur vie tous les jours
pour une flotte plus intéressée par
leurs erreurs que leurs succčs.
Ils ne demandent pas votre pitié,
mais ils méritent vraiment votre respect.
Dieux, Chef,
on a fait ça deux fois déjŕ.
Ouais, mais quelque chose ne va pas.
- Quoi ?
- Quelque chose ne va pas.
Dépęchez-vous.
Dieux !
C'est super.
C'est vraiment génial.
Je le savais.
Comment j'ai pu manquer ça ?
Peut-ętre que si vos matelots passaient
plus de temps ŕ bosser et moins ŕ glander.
Ce matelot vient de sauver votre cul,
madame.
Répétez ça un peu plus fort, Chef.
Je crois que la caméra n'a pas entendu.
Vous savez quoi ? J'emmerde la caméra.
- Vous essayez de...
- Putain...
Fermez-la ! Fermez-la !
Chef
réparez le vaisseau.
Ouais, réparez le vaisseau.
- Quoi ? Quoi ?
- Assez !
Chef, réparez son vaisseau.
Toi, fous le camp d'ici.
Dégage-moi cette caméra.
Elle m'a fait chier toute la semaine.
Qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
Je la retire de la patrouille jusqu'ŕ
ce qu'elle se calme.
Pas possible. On a besoin des pilotes.
En plus, si je saquais tous ceux qui...
se sont engueulés avec le Chef,
les cuistots piloteraient.
Putain de merde.
Vous avez tout eu ?
- Vous ętes contents ?
- Viens.
Viens, éloigne-toi.
Éloigne-toi.
On n'a pas été formé
au contrôle de la foule.
La priorité, quand on est attaqué, c'est
de défendre la section et soi-męme.
Mais ils étaient civils.
J'ai dix points de suture qui montrent
que nous étions attaqués.
La vérité, c'est que Tigh a fait une bourde
en nous envoyant sur ce ravitailleur.
Ça m'étonne pas que quelqu'un veuille
dégommer cet enculé de poivrot.
- Arrętez ça, soldat.
- Le Colonel Tigh a été menacé ?
Cette interview est terminée.
Éteignez ça.
- Commandant.
- Attention ŕ la marche.
Ok, viens.
Rapport de situation.
La flotte est calme.
Aucun contact ennemi depuis 10 jours.
Aucun contact Cylon, en tous cas.
Ils ont leur boulot, on a le nôtre.
Vous savez pour la réunion
sur le Cloud Nine ?
Des porte-paroles de chaque vaisseau
de la flotte qui viennent
pour une putain de réunion XXL.
Ouais, je sais.
On a été invité ŕ envoyer
une délégation.
C'est vous.
Vous permettez ?
Non, non, continuez.
C'est bon.
Je ne suis pas le gars le plus populaire
de la flotte en ce moment.
Alors il serait bon de...
montrer ŕ vos détracteurs
qu'ils ne vous font pas peur.
C'est ça que vous pensez ?
Que je me cache ?
Mais qu'est-ce qu'il se passe, Bill ?
Tu fais ça depuis trop longtemps pour
te soucier des arričre-pensées.
Tu y vas parce que tu n'as pas peur,
et que les gens doivent le voir.
En outre, ça permettra aux gens
d'exprimer leurs sentiments
au lieu de les ressasser en privé.
Et pour finir...
Je crois que tu as besoin de vacances.
Alors considčre ça comme
une permission obligatoire.
Nage un peu. Repose-toi.
Monsieur.
Et...
Évite le bar.
Trois.
Il y en a trois. Voilŕ l'équipage.
Bonne chance Colonel.
Amusez-vous bien sur le Cloud Nine.
Tu parles.
Séquence de décollage.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Annulez le décollage ! Tous dehors !
Que tout le monde recule !
Reculez de suite !
Équipe incendie !
Amenez l'équipe incendie maintenant !
Que se passe-t-il ?
La plate-forme principale est foutue.
Comme si on l'avait frappée au marteau.
Si elle avait explosé en vol, la cabine
aurait été dépressurisée dans l'espace.
Quelqu'un essaie de te tuer.
Ça va avec les chevrons.
A cause de ce satané incident du Gidéon.
- Ellen, nous ne le savons pas.
- Bien sűr que si.
D'Anna Biers a déjŕ
laissé deux messages.
Elle te donne l'occasion
de donner ta version.
Je n'ai pas ŕ m'expliquer
et surtout pas ŕ elle.
Roslin veut calmer la flotte
en remettant le grand Bill Adama
sur son piédestal.
La maničre la plus rapide de le faire
est de t'évincer.
Pourquoi Adama voulait t'envoyer
sur le Cloud Nine ŕ ton avis ?
Le Gidéon s'est passé
sous mon commandement.
Oui.
Mais tu n'as pas ordonné
ŕ ces empotés d'ouvrir le feu.
C'est tellement toi, Saul.
Toujours ce fier soldat,
qui prends les coups
parce que c'est honorable.
Quand vas-tu réaliser...
que nous sommes tous seuls ?
Avez-vous peur lorsque
vous partez combattre ?
La premičre chose qu'on vous dit
c'est de présumer que tu es déjŕ mort.
Ça semble... morbide.
Oui, peut-ętre.
Mais un mort ne craint rien et ne
se fige pas sous le feu ennemi.
J'ai seulement peur
que l'enfer soit désert
Et je vais le remplir avec tous les
putains de toasteurs que je trouverai.
Qu'est ce qui a été
le plus dur pour vous ?
Ils essayent de vous enlever
votre humanité parce que...
C'est ce qui vous rend vulnérable, mais...
quand on est sur le terrain,
ce n'est pas aussi simple.
Rien n'est aussi simple.
Vous avez cinq minutes.
Sharon ?
C'est moi.
Sharon !
- Donnez-moi votre lampe !
- De quoi vous parlez ?
Donnez-moi votre lampe, maintenant !
Quelque chose ne va pas.
Dieux. Appelez le Dr Cottle !
Maintenant !
Est-ce que cela vous aide
ŕ faire face au stress ?
Pas vraiment.
J'ai toujours voulu ętre
officier sur un Battlestar.
Je me suis entraîné toute ma vie,
plus que n'importe qui dans mon unité.
En fait...
j'ai mis ma vie entre parenthčses,
jusqu'ŕ ce que je sois
affecté sur le Galactica.
Ensuite les Cylons ont attaqué et...
j'ai réalisé que c'était
tout ce que je savais.
Manuels techniques, ordres,
et tactiques, vous voyez ?
Je ne dis pas que je suis malheureux.
Je me demande juste s'il y a autre chose.
Et qu'avez-vous découvert ?
Je déteste les cigarettes.
L'ambroisie se laisse boire.
Et...
Si vous avez assez d'ambroisie...
ça ne fait pas si mal que ça.
Pour vous.
On va essayer de faire ça en douceur.
Un verre ?
C'est une interview ou un cocktail ?
Vous rigolez ?
Avec ça c'est moins pénible.
J'aime seulement que ça reste
décontracté, c'est tout.
S'il vous plaît.
- Santé, Colonel.
- Santé.
Avant de commencer...
J'ai entendu des rumeurs selon lesquelles
vous avez reçu des menaces de mort.
Est-ce vrai ?
C'est un vaisseau militaire.
Il y a des rumeurs ŕ chaque occasion.
A-t-il été difficile pour vous de prendre
le commandement d'un ami blessé ?
Je n'ai rien pris du tout.
Le commandement me revenait,
et j'ai fait mon devoir.
Mais vous avez eu les pleins pouvoirs
pendant plus d'une semaine.
et durant ce temps il y a eu plusieurs
actions controversées.
Vous parlez du Gidéon.
J'ai pris une décision militaire.
Si c'était ŕ refaire,
je ne changerais rien.
Donc vous n'avez aucun regret ?
- Vous essayez de me piéger.
- Col. pourquoi pensez-vous
qu'il n'y a eu aucune enquęte officielle
sur le massacre du Gidéon ?
- Colonel, s'il vous plaît...
- Dégagez de lŕ !
T'as eu ça ?
Je l'ai.
Quel poivrot minable.
Super.
- Je ne suis pas contre un partenaire.
- Désolée, je...
- Je n'ai pas apporté mes gants.
- Dommage.
Le Cpt. Adama a dit que je pouvais
vous interroger sur les nouveaux pilotes.
Oui, le Capitaine Adama...
aime me titiller.
Qu'attendez-vous d'une nouvelle recrue ?
Coordination.
Bons réflexes.
Dévouement total.
Et par dessus tout,
quelqu'un d'assez fou
pour me suivre au combat.
<i>Cl. pourquoi pensez-vous qu'il
n'y a eu aucune enquęte officielle</i>
<i>sur le massacre du Gidéon ?</i>
<i>- Colonel, s'il vous plaît...
- Dégagez de lŕ !</i>
Je voudrais m'excuser pour
l'attitude du Colonel Tigh.
C'était déplacé.
On dirait que beaucoup de gens
ont dű s'excuser
pour lui ces derničres années,
Commandant.
Donc soyez franc avec moi.
Pourquoi le Col. Tigh n'a pas été
inculpé dans l'incident du Gidéon ?
Nous sommes en guerre...
contre un ennemi,
bien plus puissant.
Je ne vais pas livrer
le peu de gens qu'il nous reste
en sacrifice sur la place publique.
Donc quatre civils sont morts,
et Tigh et les tireurs s'en sortent.
Personne ne s'en sort.
Ils vont tous devoir vivre avec.
<i>Viper 5-9-1, ici Galactica.</i>
<i>Vous ętes autorisée ŕ vous poser.</i>
Piste bâbord, approche manuelle.
Tout est au vert. Confirmez.
<i>Je confirme.</i>
Attendez une seconde.
Dieux... Merde !
Célérité 2-0-5. Maintiens ta vitesse Kat.
Tu vas passer sous
la trajectoire d'approche.
Les commandes ne répondent pas.
Allez, allez, allez...
Tu es toujours trop basse. Annule, Kat.
Annule !
Mais qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
C'est son troisičme abandon.
Quand on a un contact,
l'escadron n'a que quelques secondes
pour se rassembler.
Avant-vol, vérification des armes,
communications.
Une erreur, on est de la
bouillie dans le cockpit.
- Je ne comprends pas. Elle essaie de...
- Fermez-la.
Kat ?
<i>On va y arriver, d'accord ?</i>
Laisse la manette des gaz au point mort,
ensuite
tire-la quand tu approches
et tu seras sur le pont.
<i>Les commandes sont détraquées.</i>
Je le sens pas. Je le sens pas.
Je peux pas le faire.
On l'a déjŕ fait ŕ l'entraînement, Ok ?
Tu peux le faire, comme avant.
Viper 591, ici Galactica,
vous ętes autorisée ŕ apponter,
c'est ŕ vous.
Trop bas, 591, abandonnez !
Abandonnez !
Non, elle va se poser !
Kat, pleins gaz, maintenant !
Je le sens pas.
Quand tu reviens d'un raid réussi,
je vous dis pas.
C'est mieux qu'un super repas.
Mieux que de gagner le jackpot,
mieux que le sexe.
<i>Je peux pas le faire !
Je peux pas le faire !</i>
<i>Je peux pas le faire !</i>
Elle a manqué la trappe.
Contrôle des dégâts, médecins,
ralliez l'aire d'appontage.
Mais qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Kat a apponté cent fois.
Ouais, la 101čme c'était la merde.
Non ! Lâchez-moi ! Laissez-moi partir !
Kat !
- C'est Starbuck, ça va. T'es chez toi.
- Chez moi ?
Chez moi c'est mort ! On doit se barrer !
Ils vont tous nous tuer !
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ? Des stimulants ?
- Ne prenez pas ça !
- Stop !
- Ne me les prenez pas !
Lâchez-moi !
Laissez-moi !
Lâchez-moi !
On va mourir !
Emmenez mon pilote ŕ l'infirmerie
immédiatement !
S'il vous plait, ne m'emmenez pas !
Des stimulants. Et ŕ la voir,
elle en prend par poignées.
Ne me touchez pas !
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Écoutez-moi !
J'essaye de sauver votre bébé.
- Tenez-la.
- C'est une zone interdite !
Commandant, elle est ici.
Commandant Adama.
Cette femme ressemble au lieutenant Valerii.
La cassette, s'il vous plait.
Pourquoi le Galactica abriterait un Cylon ?
La cassette.
Le bébé a-t-il survécu ?
Vous comprenez que
męme une allusion ŕ cela
pourrait ętre désastreux
pour le moral de la flotte ?
Vous ętes le roi de l'euphémisme.
Vous savez, aprčs le Gidéon ça pourrait
retourner toute la flotte contre vous.
Alors la véritable question est
si cela compte pour vous ou pas.
J'en ai marre des gens comme vous qui
doutent de mon patriotisme.
Nous voulons tous
que cette flotte survive.
Vous vous en sortez trčs bien.
Trčs bien, vu les circonstances.
Je suis conscient que ça a été
un travail difficile pour vous.
J'ai entendu que vos reportages
ne vous ont pas vraiment
fait bien voir du Commandant,
n'est-ce pas ?
Ni du reste de l'équipage, d'ailleurs.
Cependant, heureusement,
en tant que membre du gouvernement civil,
je voulais vous garantir que je n'ai
pas de telles réserves.
La plupart de l'équipage comprend
que je ne fais que mon travail.
Comme nous tous.
Nous ne faisons tous que notre travail.
Je ne fais que mon travail,
- vous ne faites que votre travail.
- Ok, abrčge, Gaius.
Dis-lui pourquoi tu mérites
de diriger cette flotte.
J'ai pu me rendre compte
quand j'avais échoué...
... échoué sur Kobol,
j'ai découvert que la pression
pour la survie avait révélé
des qualités de dirigeant que je
ne savais męme pas posséder,
je vous l'assure.
Vraiment ?
J'ai cru comprendre que votre détachement
a subi plusieurs pertes.
Oui, c'était vraiment malchanceux.
Ils étaient des héros, chacun d'eux.
Vous savez quoi ? Je suis pręt.
On la filme, celle-lŕ ?
C'est probablement une fausse alerte.
Ignorez-la, vraiment.
Bell, tu prends le hangar de pont.
- Je prends le CIC. Allez !
- Vous ętes d'avantage en sécurité ici.
L'endroit le plus sűr est ici, vraiment.
<i>Raiders cylons en approche.
Ce n'est pas un exercice.</i>
<i>- ... aux postes de combat.
- C'est ça le showbiz.</i>
<i>Condition 1 sur tout le vaisseau.
Ceci n'est pas un exercice.</i>
- Qu'est-ce qu'on a ?
- Deux Raiders en approche rapide.
Monsieur,
les Raiders cylons sont en
D.F.D.D. avec le Galactica.
Vitesse 22.79
Qu'est-ce qu'une "D.F.D.D." ?
Direction Fixe, Distance
Décroissante, trajectoire de collision.
- Oů est donc la CAP ?
- De l'autre côté de la flotte.
Faites décoller les chasseurs d'alerte.
Passez toute la flotte en condition 1.
Dites leur de tenir pręt leur moteur FTL
au cas oů.
Allez, allez ! Allons-y !
- Dégagez ce pont, virez-moi ça d'ici !
- Situation ?
2 ennemis en approche rapide.
- Ouvrez l'śil et suivez-nous.
- D'accord, on y va,
on fait décoller ces oiseaux.
Sortez-les, dégagez cette échelle d'ici.
Allez, allez ! Reculez,
enlevez-moi ce tuyau.
- Premičre équipe dans les tubes.
- Dee.
Les pilotes sont sur haut-parleur.
<i>Ętes-vous jamais arrivée ŕ
un accord avec votre pčre ?</i>
<i>Je ne lui ai jamais permis.</i>
<i>La derničre fois que nous avons discuté,
ça s'est...</i>
<i>échauffé.</i>
<i>Je lui ai dit que je ne voulais
plus jamais le revoir.</i>
<i>Trois semaines plus tard,
les Cylons ont attaqué.</i>
Ok, c'est nouveau pour moi.
Je devrais ętre effrayée ?
Je le suis.
Bien compris.
Bon, ça y est.
Le dernier oiseau est parti.
Nettoyez le nid.
Préparez le pont pour la récupération.
Allez, allez, allez ! Bougez-vous !
Monsieur, les Vipers d'alerte sont partis.
Le contrôle de l'armement nous signale que
les armes sont prętes et en service.
<i>Ici Apollo, contrôle radio.</i>
<i>Ici Starbuck, je t'entends.</i>
<i>Ici Hotdog, 141, cinq sur cinq.</i>
<i>- Ici Grayshirt, cinq sur cinq.
- Ici Kingston, c'est bon.</i>
<i>Engagement de la recherche delta.</i>
<i>Ici Apollo, je confirme :
deux Raiders cylons en formation serrée.</i>
<i>Ici Starbuck, bien compris.</i>
<i>- Ici Kingston, tenez votre formation.
- Préparez-vous ŕ attaquer. Armes prętes.</i>
<i>Cibles en vue. Je répčte, cibles en vue.</i>
<i>Verrouillage 6-1-2-1.
Feu ŕ volonté 2-4-1.</i>
Bien reçu.
<i>Tango 1, feu ŕ volonté 2-4-1.</i>
<i>On attaque les Raiders cylons.</i>
<i>Ils rompent la formation.
Hotdog, avec moi.</i>
<i>Compris.</i>
<i>Viens-la, espčce...</i>
<i>J'ai plus de manche.
Plus de commandes manuelles.</i>
<i>Il est sur moi, ŕ six heures.</i>
<i>- Allez, Starbuck.
- Allez...</i>
<i>Hotdog, Raider ŕ 8 heures. Je m'en occupe.</i>
<i>Je l'ai.</i>
<i>Ouais, un d'éclaté !</i>
<i>Ciblage du deuxičme Raider.</i>
<i>Kingston, il décroche, manśuvre d'évitement.</i>
<i>Je l'ai, Kingston.
Allez, viens voir papa.</i>
<i>Putain, abats-le !</i>
<i>- On l'a eu !
- Oui !</i>
Le dradis est dégagé, Commandant.
Ici le Commandant.
<i>Les Raiders cylons ont été
interceptés et détruits.</i>
<i>Bon travail tout le monde.</i>
<i>Compris Galactica.</i>
<i>On rentre au nid.</i>
Postes de combat, sécurisez-les.
Passez en alerte trois.
M. Gaeta,
le pont est ŕ vous.
Oui, Monsieur.
Alerte trois dans tout le vaisseau.
<i>Je répčte, alerte trois.</i>
Est-ce que ça devient plus facile ?
Non madame.
Ça devient plus difficile.
Merci.
- Plus quinze degrés.
- Quinze...
Comment ça s'est passé dehors ?
On n'a perdu personne.
C'est un bon jour.
Ellen ?
Je suis pas sűre d'avoir trouvé
une histoire lŕ-dedans.
Reviens un peu en arričre.
Lŕ.
Je connais ce livre.
C'est de Kataris.
Qu'y a-t-il Colonel ?
Besoin d'un verre ?
Va en enfer.
J'y ai été.
Ça s'appelle le Gidéon.
Je mange plus, je...
dors plus.
Je vois leurs visages.
C'est pas des Cylons qu'on a descendus.
C'était des vraies personnes...
qui ressemblaient ŕ mon pčre,
ŕ mon petit frčre.
Ça ne changera rien.
Au moins les gens du Gidéon
seront vengés.
Si c'est ça, alors vas-y.
Je vais le faire.
Quelqu'un doit payer pour ce
qu'il s'est passé sur ce vaisseau.
C'est moi qui commandait.
Je vous y ai envoyés.
C'est ma faute.
Allez fiston.
Fais-le.
Le Gidéon était un accident.
Ça, c'est un choix.
Colonel ! On est lŕ.
On y va Lieutenant.
Voulez-vous bien dégager de lŕ ?
Pourquoi vous avez fait ça, Kat ?
J'étais fatiguée.
J'arrivais pas ŕ dormir.
Je perdais ma concentration.
Je savais pas quoi faire d'autre.
- Vous ne pouviez pas parler ŕ quelqu'un ?
- A qui ? On est tous dans la męme merde.
Y a pas de relčve qui arrive.
Pas de repos. C'est comme ça.
Alors j'ai commencé
ŕ prendre des stimulants.
<i>Vous avez fait une erreur, ça arrive.</i>
<i>Mais du coup mon escadron
a un pilote en moins.</i>
<i>Ces gars,</i>
<i>ils étaient aussi fatigués
et perturbés que moi.</i>
<i>Mais ils continuent ŕ risquer leur vie.</i>
<i>Je me suis cassé le cul
ŕ défendre cette flotte.</i>
<i>J'ai été...</i>
<i>J'ai été frustrée, j'ai été furieuse.</i>
<i>J'ai été tout ce que
vous pouvez imaginer.</i>
<i>Mais c'est la premičre fois</i>
<i>que je me suis sentie honteuse.</i>
J'en ai vu assez.
Coupe.
Écoutez,
je comprends que ce soit
dur ŕ regarder...
C'est du boulot de boucher.
La flotte croit déjŕ qu'on est une
bande d'assassins ŕ la gachette facile.
Ça le confirme.
Vous nous montrez le cul ŕ l'air.
Vous n'avez rien ŕ dire ?
Je pense que c'est trčs bien.
Je pense qu'elle a fait exactement
ce que nous lui avons demandé.
Elle a mis un visage humain
aux gardiens de la flotte.
Avec tous ses défauts.
J'en suis fier.
Vous pouvez le montrer ŕ la flotte.
Ça pouvait pas ętre mieux.
J'aimerais voir la fin.
Moi aussi.
Vas-y.
<i>Je suis venue sur le Galactica
pour raconter une histoire.</i>
<i>Honnętement, je pensais connaître cette
histoire avant d'y mettre les pieds.</i>
<i>Comment des militaires arrogants laissaient
leur égo interférer avec leur travail.</i>
<i>La sauvegarde de la population civile.</i>
<i>Mais la vérité est plus complexe que cela.</i>
<i>Ce ne sont pas des Cylons.</i>
<i>Ce ne sont pas des robots suivant aveuglement
les ordres et polissant leurs bottes.</i>
<i>Ce sont des personnes.</i>
<i>Trčs imparfaites, oui, mais aussi trčs humaines.</i>
<i>Ce qui est sűrement la męme chose.</i>
<i>Ce qui m'a le plus frappée est,
qu'en dépit de tout ça,</i>
<i>les difficultés, le stress,
la menace permanente de mourir,</i>
<i>en dépit de tout ça, ils n'abandonnent jamais.</i>
<i>Ils ne se couchent jamais sur la route
pour laisser le camion les écraser.</i>
<i>Ils se lčvent le matin, enfilent leur uniforme,
et font leur travail.</i>
<i>Chaque jour.
Sans solde, ni repos.</i>
<i>Sans espoir de se débarasser de ce fardeau
et laisser quelqu'un d'autre faire le boulot.</i>
<i>Aucune relčve ne viendra.</i>
<i>Pas de flotte coloniale entraînant
de nouvelles recrues tous les jours.</i>
<i>Les gens du Galactica sont tout ce qu'il y a.</i>
<i>Ils sont le dernier rempart
qui nous protčge des Cylons.</i>
<i>Le Lt. Gaeta m'a donné un chiffre remarquable.</i>
<i>Pas un seul membre d'équipage du Galactica
n'a demandé ŕ demissionner. Pas un.</i>
<i>Pensez-y.</i>
<i>Si vous portiez l'uniforme,
ne voudriez-vous pas partir ?</i>
<i>Partir en disant : "Ça suffit, que
quelqu'un d'autre protčge la flotte."</i>
<i>Je sais que je le ferais.</i>
<i>Mais encore une fois, je ne porte pas l'uniforme.</i>
<i>La plupart d'entre nous ne le porte pas,
et ne le portera jamais.</i>
<i>L'histoire du Galactica n'est pas qu'ils prennent
de mauvaises décisions sous pression.</i>
<i>C'est que ces erreurs sont les exceptions.</i>
<i>La plupart du temps, les hommes et femmes
du Commandant Adama ont raison.</i>
<i>La preuve est que notre flotte survit.</i>
<i>Et avec le Galactica ŕ nos
côtés, cela continuera.</i>
<i>Ici D'Anna Biers, service de
presse de la flotte.</i>
Ça a été diffusé dans toute la flotte.
Leur résistance est remarquable.
Mettez le passage qui a été coupé.
<i>Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?</i>
<i>- Écoutez-moi !
- Arrętez !</i>
<i>J'essaie de sauver votre enfant.</i>
<i>- Tenez-la.
- C'est une zone restreinte !</i>
Je suis toujours vivante.
Elle est toujours vivante.
Je vous l'avais dit.
C'est incroyable.
Et le bébé ?
Ils l'ont sauvé.
Nous avons perdu deux Raiders
pour relayer les images, mais...
je pense que ça en valait le coup.
Nous devons agir avec prudence.
La vie de l'enfant doit
ętre protegée ŕ tout prix.
Oui.
Un vrai miracle de Dieu.

LES CYLONS FURENT
CRÉÉS PAR L'HOMME
ILS ÉVOLUÈRENT
ILS SE RÉVOLTÈRENT
IL Y A DE NOMBREUSES COPIES
ET ILS ONT UN PLAN.
Précédemment dans
Battlestar Galactica
On met en réseau l'ordinateur FTL,
avec ceux de la navigation, du DC
et de l'armement.
Une fois reliés,
nous ne mettrons que
10 minutes pour tout calculer.
Vraiment, vous allez surpasser les Cylons
en programmation ?
Les Cylons piratent notre réseau.
Ils essaient d'accéder
à notre serveur central.
C'était quoi ce bordel ?
C'est le virus, Monsieur.
Je pense qu'il a dû générer
des copies de lui même
sur d'autres ordinateurs.
Il a désactivé le générateur principal
et les unités auxiliaires.
Je t'aime, Chef.
T'attends quoi de moi, Helo ?
C'est un Cylon !
Je ne te laisserai pas la tuer.
Elle porte mon enfant.
J'ai un cancer du sein en stade terminal.
Le Dr. Cottle confirmera le diagnostic.
Il me reste quelques mois à vivre.
Viper 2-8-9, comment
allons-nous aujourd'hui ?
Super...
Je savais où te trouver.
Karl Agathon.
Tu te joins à nous ?
La prochaine fois, peut-être.
C'est lui l'amateur de Cylons ?
Je me fous de savoir avec qui
ou quoi il baise.
Il m'a sauvé la peau là-bas, ok ?
Mais comment peut-on tomber amoureux
d'un toasteur ?
De la même manière qu'on
copinait tous avec Sharon
juste avant qu'elle tire 2 balles
sur Adama.
Ces bâtards te foutent la tête en l'air.
Ouais.
Demande au Chef.
Je le savais.
J'ai besoin d'un verre.
Bronzée, reposée, prête. Regarde-toi.
Surtout reposée. A part manger et dormir
y'avait rien à faire.
"Tir d'arme non autorisé."
Tu parles d'une charge !
Tu mériterais une médaille pour avoir
éclaté ce toasteur.
Chef...
- On m'a dit que vous m'aviez défendue.
- Oubliez ça.
- Je veux que vous sachiez...
- Oubliez ça !
J'ai besoin de tous les matelots
disponibles.
Sharon a accompli 47 missions là-dedans.
Elle n'a jamais pu atterrir correctement.
Je devais redresser les trains
d'atterrissage à chaque appontage.
Les approches la rendaient nerveuse,
- elle avait peur que vous la regardiez.
- Je le faisais souvent.
Et puis merde.
Tu te couches avec 3 As, t'es dingue ?
Pas quand tu as mieux...
Haut Prince Rouge, hein ?
Ca fait un bail que je joue avec ces
cartes, j'en connais toutes les marques.
Alors la vie c'est de la merde.
Tu veux faire quoi, chialer pour ça ?
Non, je veux juste que ça s'arrête, ok ?
La mauvaise bouffe,
les patrouilles sans fin,
prétendre qu'un jeu de carte est le point
culminant du jour.
Ça va pas durer éternellement.
La Terre est proche.
C'est ça.
On se mord la queue
autour d'un planétarium à la con.
Vous pouvez tous aller au diable.
Je vais rejoindre Helo.
Bonne idée.
Peut-être que la pute cylon lui a appris
quelques tours.
Écoutez, Chef...
Je n'avais pas prévu pour Sharon et moi...
Vous savez, ça a juste évolué.
Juste un couple d'ados amoureux.
Je connais ses sentiments pour vous.
D'accord ? Elle vous aime.
Elle vous avait informé du reste du plan ?
On allait s'installer
dès la fin de notre service.
Ensuite, on se serait mariés. Peut-être...
qu'on aurait eu des enfants.
Je dois être qu'un putain de gros con,
non ?
Certainement le même plan de toasteur
depuis le début.
- Ne l'appelez pas ainsi.
- Embobiner un con pour lui donner un enfant.
Vous savez quoi ?
Je devrais vous remercier.
Vous remercier. Vous savez pourquoi ?
Car le monstre dans son ventre
aurait pu être le mien.
Ça va ?
- Désolé.
- Fils de...
Ça suffit, Chef !
C'est pas à vous de décider ça.
Assez !
Je sais même pas pourquoi
je suis en colère contre vous.
Ma Sharon est morte.
Cette chose dans la cellule,
c'est pas Sharon.
Reçu, leader bleu. Annoncez
le niveau de carburant.
C'est quoi ce bordel ?
C'était nous, Monsieur, mais
je n'arrive pas à trouver la source.
Quelque chose trafique nos communications
pour émettre un signal automatique.
Que les Cylons pourraient suivre
pour avoir notre position.
Faisons comme si pour le moment.
Actualisez et envoyez les coordonnées
des sites de sauts d'urgence au cas où
ils réapparaîtraient.
Dee, passez-moi un...
47 853 survivants
A la recherche d'un foyer
Appelé Terre.
Terre.
- Ça va, Monsieur.
- Non restez couchée.
Vous irez voir le Dr. Cottle
pour voir si tout va bien.
M. Gaeta, trouvez ce qui s'est passé.
Je n'ai rien.
Monsieur Gaeta.
Une surtension a grillé la console.
Le système est perturbé depuis que
les Cylons ont infiltré notre réseau.
Monsieur Gaeta,
c'était plus qu'une perturbation.
Le Cdt. a raison.
Je me fiche que vous deviez relire le
programme ligne par ligne. Corrigez-le !
Pardon ?
Vous m'avez compris.
J'ai effectué
tous les diagnostics possibles.
Vérifier chaque ligne de code
prendrait des jours.
Vos excuses ne m'intéressent pas.
Corrigez-le !
Ce n'est pas une excuse.
C'est un putain de fait !
Monsieur Gaeta.
Oui Monsieur.
Reprenez-vous.
Je suis désolé, Monsieur.
C'est quoi son putain de problème ?
Des mois de cavale,
et avec quoi comme résultat ?
Des pertes humaines.
Des conditions qui se dégradent.
L'équipage a besoin de repos.
Ils s'en rendent enfin compte, Saul.
Leur ancienne vie a disparu.
Voila tout ce qui nous attend.
Chef, où est le 2-8-9 ? J'en ai besoin
pour l'entraînement aujourd'hui.
Il est cloué au sol.
Quoi ? Pour longtemps ?
Définitivement.
On récupère ce qu'on peut
mais il est mort.
Merde, j'ai besoin de ce vaisseau.
Que voulez-vous que je vous dise ?
Les supports moteurs sont bousillés.
Le cockpit est fissuré.
- Si c'était un cheval, je l'abattrais.
- J'ai un truc Chef.
Allez Chef, aidez-moi.
J'ai besoin de vous.
Que voulez-vous ?
Que je tue mon équipe à la tâche ?
Non, faites de votre mieux.
Personne n'attend de miracle.
C'est peut-être ça le problème.
<i>Putain de merde. Pourquoi pas ?</i>
Qu'est-ce qui se passe, Chef ?
Bien, voila le topo.
Nous allons construire
un nouveau chasseur.
Et pour le reste des Vipers ?
J'ai trois jours de retard
sur les réparations.
Ce projet est hors-programme.
Personne ne doit rogner sur les
réparations et maintenances courantes.
Vous pensez pas qu'on puisse le faire ?
Je saurais même pas par où commencer.
- C'est pas nouveau !
- Je t'emmerde.
Il s'agit de construire le châssis,
l'avionique, et les systèmes de survie.
C'est pas possible, putain.
Vous savez quoi ? Laissez tomber.
Je n'ai pas besoin de vous.
- Chef, attendez. C'est pas ça.
- J'ai dit de laisser tomber.
Retournez travailler.
C'est un ordre.
Combien de temps il me reste ?
Quelques semaines.
Un mois tout au plus.
Pourrais-je quand même travailler ?
Sauf si le cancer atteint le cerveau.
Si cela arrive, vous...
T'es un chouïa agressif.
Ferme-la et tire.
Par tous les Dieux, entre toi et Racetrack,
c'est comme...
on marche vraiment
sur des œufs pour discuter.
Tu es la dernière à pouvoir me donner
des leçons de bonnes manières.
Il parait que tu t'es aussi
embrouillé avec le Chef Tyrol.
Appuie.
Je lui ai juste rappelé que pour moi,
la maintenance des Vipers
était prioritaire sur...
son "projet hobby".
Bien !
Je suis étonnée qu'il ne tait pas cogné.
Allez, Starbuck.
Tu ne crois tout de même pas
que cette poubelle va voler, non ?
50 cubits qu'elle volera.
Ah oui ?
Et qui pilotera ? Sûrement pas moi.
Me regardez pas.
Je ne te regardais pas.
Quoi ?
Je la piloterai.
Je la piloterai.
Toi ?
Moi.
- Pourquoi ?
- Parce que...
Pendant que tout le monde
se lamente dans son coin,
On se lamente ?
le Chef, lui, va de l'avant.
Je suis profondément ému.
- Vraiment ?
- Vraiment.
Ses lèvres sont bleues.
Tu as l'air d'une myrtille.
Il n'y a pas d'oxygène.
Il n'y a pas d'oxygène.
Il n'y a pas d'oxygène.
Je suis à sec.
Joli tir.
Le régulateur a estimé
que le stand de tir était en surpression,
et a donc relâché de l'air
pour compenser.
Deux minutes de plus et on était mort.
Fluctuations électriques.
Défaillances matérielles...
Monsieur, je crois avoir trouvé la cause.
- C'est quoi ?
- Une bombe logique cylon.
Un virus informatique adaptatif.
Il est capable d'apprendre,
d'évoluer, et doit tourner maintenant
sur tous les postes du vaisseau.
en attente d'être activé.
Il a dû être implanté
quand les Cylons ont infiltré
le réseau mis en place par le Col. Tigh
le jour où on vous a tiré dessus.
C'était il y a plusieurs semaines.
Pourquoi maintenant ?
Il lui a sans doute fallu ce temps
pour décrypter nos codes d'accès.
Et dès lors, il a commencé à
essayer de contrôler nos systèmes...
électriques, atmosphériques.
Comment peut-on le détruire ?
C'est là que ça se corse.
Si c'est bien un virus cylon,
il va être extrêmement difficile
à éradiquer.
J'ai de la chance alors...
parce que j'ai un expert à bord.
Dites à Helo de soumettre ça
à notre prisonnière.
Allez.
Allez.
Pour l'amour des Dieux !
Fils de pute !
Bordel de merde !
C'est bon. Retourne à ton boulot.
C'est un travail pour deux, Chef.
Vous voulez monter cette aile, ou pas ?
A trois. Un, deux, trois.
Super. Super. Maintiens-la.
Monsieur ?
On a encore des défaillances électriques
et matérielles sur tout le vaisseau.
Merci.
On devrait augmenter le niveau d'alerte et
tenir prêtes les équipes de maintenance.
Pas encore.
As-tu vu le vaisseau
que construit le Chef ?
Son chasseur imaginaire ?
Pas besoin, c'est une perte de temps.
L'équipage du pont n'est pas de ton avis.
On doit se concentrer sur ceux qui nous
reste. Pas se lancer dans un rêve éveillé.
Tu devrais y mettre fin.
Peut-être plus tard.
Mais ce projet leur donne un but.
Je ne vais pas leur enlever ça.
Pour l'instant.
Le Dr. Cottle est d'accord.
J'avais envie de me défouler.
Bien.
Ne te mets pas en garde.
Tourne.
Et baisse le genou.
C'est bien.
Non.
Si tu veux les mettre à terre...
Je prends ta place.
Tête bloquée. Attrape le poignet.
Maintiens le bras.
Puis je vais baisser le genou,
et tourner de 45°.
Ok.
- Tout va bien ?
- Oui.
Me voilà revenue à l'entraînement.
Un vrai adversaire cette fois.
Et ôte-lui le couteau.
Billy.
- Quand es-tu arrivé ?
- A l'instant.
Tu te souviens d'avoir été avec le Chef
avant l'attaque cylon ?
<i>Oui.</i>
Désolée. C'est toi qui voulais savoir.
<i>Tu l'aimes toujours ?</i>
Helo.
<i>Tu es le père de mon enfant.</i>
<i>Tu es le premier dans mon cœur</i>
<i>et rien ne changera jamais cela.</i>
OK, il faut que je te montre ceci.
<i>Le Dr. Baltar dit que c'est
une espèce de bombe logique cylon.</i>
<i>Ça te dit quelque chose ?</i>
<i>Tourne la page.</i>
Je dois parler au Commandant Adama.
Tout de suite.
Pourquoi ?
C'est bien un virus cylon.
<i>Il a exploré vos systèmes, les testant,
s'adaptant, cherchant des points faibles.</i>
Dans quel but ?
Pour retourner les systèmes
du Galactica contre vous.
<i>Pour vous faire percuter
d'autres vaisseaux,</i>
<i>exploser vos dépôts d'armes,</i>
<i>étouffer l'équipage.</i>
<i>Et toi alors ? Et le bébé ?</i>
Je suis un handicap pour eux.
Une erreur.
Helo, cette bombe logique
va s'activer d'ici quelques heures.
<i>Après ça, les Cylons seront sur nous.</i>
<i>Ils vont tous nous tuer.</i>
- Commandant Adama...
- Quoi que vous ayez à dire, faites vite.
Désolé de vous dire ça,
mais le cockpit est trop en arrière.
Vous aurez des problèmes de répartition
en manœuvre.
On cherche pas la manœuvrabilité,
Capitaine, mais la vitesse.
Et tu ne pensais pas
qu'il volerait de toute façon.
C'est sûr que non, vu comment son cockpit
est enfoncé dans...
Dee ?
Que fais-tu ici ?
Les communications... Je crois.
Le Chef est doué avec l'hydraulique, mais
le système de com est un bordel.
Loup en vue.
Il fallait que je voie ça de mes yeux.
D'ici peu, tout le CIC se retrouvera ici.
Vous travaillez aussi sur ce T.D. Apollo ?
Non.
Enfin quelqu'un de sensé.
Où est le Chef ? Dans l'atelier ?
Oui, en train de se reposer, Monsieur.
C'est quoi Chef ?
Je fais du solvant, Monsieur.
Pour nettoyer les moteurs.
Solvant, mon cul. Je reconnais un alambic
à l'odeur. Qu'est-ce que vous mijotez ?
J'ai besoin d'alcool
pour faire des échanges.
Je prélève ce que je peux sur la flotte,
mais j'ai besoin de moteurs.
Je sais que j'ai besoin de l'autorisation
du Cdt Adama pour récupérer des pièces.
Moteur ou pas, on sait tous les deux
que cette merde dehors ne volera jamais.
Je dois au moins essayer, Colonel.
Et pourquoi donc ?
Parce que ce vaisseau, ce projet,
c'est tout ce qu'il me reste.
Sans ça, je...
J'ai failli oublier. J'ai promis au XO
du Baah Pakal de l'aider.
- Monsieur ?
- Il a des vieux moteurs de DDG-62,
qui prennent de la place sur son pont.
C'est sûrement de la merde
mais je lui ai dit
que je lui enverrai une équipe
pour les enlever dès que possible.
- Si je peux rendre service.
- Bien.
Madame la Présidente,
votre navette est prête.
Bien sûr.
Merci encore de m'avoir laissé
vos quartiers.
Je vous en prie.
Je voulais vous rendre ceci.
C'était un cadeau.
"Ne jamais prêter un livre", je sais.
Mais...
Je l'ai eu beaucoup trop longtemps.
Il fait partie de votre bibliothèque.
Je suis en retard
à une réunion du Conseil.
Il y a un problème ?
Nos ordinateurs ont été infectés
par un virus cylon,
qui altère les systèmes
de tout le vaisseau.
Je viens juste d'apprendre
que c'est un prélude à
une attaque totale des Cylons.
Je présume que vous avez essayé
de le neutraliser.
M. Gaeta et le vice-président
s'en occupent en ce moment.
Je n'ai pas bon espoir.
Commandant, je ne sais pas ce que je peux
vous offrir à part mon soutien moral.
A vrai dire, Madame la Présidente,
j'aurais besoin de vos conseils.
Vous voulez quoi ?
Effacer complètement les disques durs,
redémarrer tous les systèmes du vaisseau,
et restaurer nos sauvegardes
d'avant-guerre.
Ça nous laissera le cul à l'air
jusqu'à ce qu'on soit reconnectés.
- Le commandant ne sera jamais d'accord.
- Je lui en ai déjà parlé.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il a dit ?
- Il y réfléchit.
C'est la seule façon de détruire le virus.
- Vous deviez rester en dehors...
- Désolé, vous voulez y survivre ou pas ?
On calcule un saut et on s'éloigne
de ces putains de Cylons...
Non, Monsieur, on ne peut pas
prendre le risque de sauter.
Tous nos systèmes sont compromis,
y compris la navigation.
Le virus pourrait nous jeter
dans un soleil.
On a plus beaucoup de temps. Notre signal
va être repéré par la flotte cylon.
Si on ne trouve rien avant alors...
Ils prendront le contrôle de tous
nos systèmes,
et ils auront cent façons
de nous éliminer.
Je viens juste de...
voir notre prisonnière cylon.
Elle nous propose une possible
solution au problème.
Et vous vous demandez si vous pouvez
lui faire confiance.
J'ai dû prendre sur moi
pour ne pas l'étrangler.
Je ne peux pas croire que j'envisage cela.
Nous savons tous les deux que les Cylons
sont experts en manipulation.
Ils feront tout ce qu'ils peuvent
pour vous embrouiller.
Ce n'est pas celle qui m'a tiré dessus.
Peuvent-ils être si différents
les uns des autres ?
Commandant, si vous me demandez s'il est
possible que votre opinion soit influencée
par vos antécédents avec ce modèle cylon
en particulier, je devrais dire oui.
Mais...
Nous les avons créés.
Il y a toujours une chance que nous
trouvions un terrain d'entente.
Nous devons travailler rapidement.
On est en sursis.
Détachez-la.
Oui Monsieur.
Dee...
vous avez toujours le couteau de poche
de votre père ?
Donnez-le-lui.
M. Gaeta,
pouvez-vous m'établir un lien
en fibre optique ?
Je dois émettre sur toutes les fréquences
et directement sur le serveur central.
- Faites-le.
- Monsieur.
Ici, Sharon.
Merci.
Dradis.
Les voilà. Cibles multiples.
Cap 3-7-1, inclinaison 5-5-2.
- Raiders cylons.
- Ces salauds nous ont suivis, c'est sûr.
Lancez les Vipers.
<i>Apollo, les Raiders sont en attente.</i>
<i>Galactica, ici Apollo.</i>
<i>Les Raiders sont en formation d'attente.</i>
<i>Je répète, Raiders en formation d'attente.</i>
Merde alors !
OK, voilà comment ça va se passer.
Les Raiders vont envoyer un signal
pour activer le virus.
Ça pourrait prendre quelques secondes.
A mon signal,
lancez le formatage des ordinateurs.
On loupe le créneau...
Le virus prend le contrôle
de tous les systèmes du vaisseau.
Parfois, il faut absolument faire
un double six. N'est-ce pas commandant ?
Mais qu'est-ce qu'elle fabrique ?
Ils ont envoyé le signal, Monsieur.
Ça bouge trop vite.
Je ne peux pas suivre.
On doit arrêter ça.
Tenez-vous prêt à lancer le formatage
à mon commandement.
Systèmes prêts, Monsieur.
Formatez les disques durs maintenant.
Faites-le.
<i>Dieux, qu'est-ce qu'ils font ?</i>
L'armement est toujours désactivé.
Pas de dradis.
Systèmes éteints.
On court vers un putain de bain de sang.
On est sans défense.
<i>Apollo, ici Hotdog. Ils arrivent !</i>
<i>- D'accord, bien reçu, Hotdog.
- Dieux, il doit y en avoir des centaines.</i>
Les Cylons avancent toujours.
Elle nous a piégés !
- Donnez-moi votre arme.
- Bien Monsieur.
S'ils viennent pour vous,
ils vont être très déçus.
Faites-le.
Qu'est-ce que vous attendez ?
Ceci.
Qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
Nous venons de transmettre un signal.
Galactica ?
On dirait qu'ils ont...
perdu leur énergie.
Ils dérivent, sans contrôle.
Qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
Les Cylons nous ont envoyé un virus.
Nous venons de leur en renvoyer un.
Apollo, ici Galactica.
Tuez ces enfoirés.
<i>Ouais !</i>
<i>Viens par ici.</i>
Bien reçu.
A tous les Vipers. Feu à volonté.
Engagez.
<i>Ça c'est une revanche.</i>
<i>Ouais ! Tu aimes ça ?</i>
<i>Vous avez vu ça ?</i>
<i>Voilà un toaster épinglé.</i>
<i>Allez !</i>
<i>- Il m'en reste un par ici !
- Allez les gars, on nettoie tout ça.</i>
- Officiers.
- Oui Monsieur.
Ramenez cette chose à sa cellule.
Et voilà, Chef.
C'est bien d'être petite, hein ?
Ce vaisseau a deux moteurs.
Occupe-toi de l'autre.
Nous sommes si prêts du but.
Il doit bien y avoir un peu de métal
pour qu'on puisse le recouvrir.
Des plaques, des cloisons.
N'importe quoi.
La plupart sont réservées
pour réparer les Vipers.
Qui a dit qu'on avait besoin de métal ?
- Composite de carbone.
- Bien joué, Helo.
Il va être coton à repérer sur le dradis,
mais la question est, va-t-il voler ?
Regarde et apprends !
<i>Instruments...</i>
<i>dans le vert.</i>
<i>Pression du carburant...</i>
<i>- Normale.
- Apollo, Starbuck.</i>
Le Blackbird est autorisé à décoller.
C'est parti.
<i>Liens magnétiques sécurisés.</i>
<i>Début de la séquence de lancement.</i>
M'explose pas à la gueule, saloperie.
<i>Décollage autorisé.</i>
<i>Blackbird est parti.</i>
Tu vas te calmer ? Commence doucement.
<i>Tu testes le vaisseau.</i>
<i>Pas besoin de frimer.</i>
<i>Je frime pas.</i>
<i>Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Qu'est-ce que t'essayes de prouver ?</i>
Rien du tout !
C'est quoi ce bordel ?
Seigneurs !
OK.
Voyons voir ce qu'il peut faire.
<i>Starbuck ? Où es-tu ?</i>
<i>Starbuck ? Tu m'entends ?</i>
<i>Starbuck !</i>
Elle est partie.
<i>Galactica, Apollo. Je l'ai perdue.
Je l'ai perdue.</i>
<i>Pas de contact dradis.</i>
Starbuck...
Starbuck, où es-tu ?
<i>Starbuck, réponds.</i>
<i>Starbuck, tu me reçois ?</i>
<i>Kara, tu vas bien ?</i>
Bien sûr que t'as perdu le contact.
C'est un vaisseau furtif, tu te souviens ?
Oh, toi !
Commandant sur le pont !
Repos.
Chef Tyrol ?
C'est le Blackbird ?
Oui Madame.
- Madame la Présidente, c'est un honneur.
- Non, l'honneur est pour moi.
C'est remarquable.
C'est seulement un vaisseau.
Vous êtes beaucoup trop modeste.
Après ce que nous avons traversé,
ce serait facile de laisser tomber,
de perdre espoir.
Mais pas ici.
Pas aujourd'hui.
C'est plus qu'un vaisseau, Chef.
C'est un acte de foi.
C'est la preuve...
que malgré tout ce que l'on a perdu,
nous continuons d'essayer.
Et que nous nous en sortirons,
nous tous, ensemble.
Je vous le promets.
Commandant.
Madame la Présidente.
C'était...
supposé être une surprise, mais...
Enfin...
Merci.
Si vous voulez nous faire cet honneur,
- Madame la Présidente.
- Bien sûr.
Je plaisante.
Super idée d'utiliser
des composites de carbone.
C'était du bon boulot.
Beau travail.
C'était adorable.
Ils voulaient faire ça pour vous.
Merci.
Rien de tout cela n'aurait été possible si
vous n'aviez pas fait confiance au Cylon.
J'ai suivi votre conseil.
Trouver un terrain d'entente.
Lequel ?
Nous voulions tous deux vivre.

LES CYLONS FURENT
CRÉÉS PAR L'HOMME
ILS ÉVOLUÈRENT
ILS SE RÉVOLTÈRENT
IL Y A DE NOMBREUSES COPIES
ET ILS ONT UN PLAN.
<i>Précédemment dans
Battlestar Galactica</i>
Ça me fout les jetons de le voir
se comporter ainsi avec elle.
Comment on peut se
laisser embringuer par un des leurs ?
Écoutez Chef.
Je sais ce qu'elle éprouvait pour vous.
Elle vous aimait.
Tu sais quoi, je devrais
probablement t'être reconnaissant.
Parce que ce monstre dans son ventre
aurait pu être le mien.
<i>Est-ce que tu as des souvenirs</i>
<i>de toi avec le Chef,
avant l'attaque des Cylons ?</i>
<i>Tu es le père de mon enfant.</i>
Tu es le premier dans mon cœur.
<i>Et jamais rien ne changera cela.</i>
Ok, voilà le plan. Nous...
allons construire un nouveau chasseur.
BlackBird, vol test, Ok pour décollage.
Galactica, ici Apollo
Je l'ai perdue.
<i>Evidemment que t'as perdu contact.</i>
C'est un putain de vaisseau furtif,
t'as oublié ?
<i>Postes de combat, postes de combat.</i>
<i>Condition 1 sur tout le vaisseau.</i>
<i>Ce n'est pas un exercice, je répète :
postes de combat, postes de combat.</i>
Madame la Présidente, on dirait que vous
avez choisi un jour d'enfer pour une visite.
Ici le Cmd. Situation.
Un contact ennemi vient de sauter
à portée du dradis, DFDD.
Par sa taille, c'est
probablement un Vaisseau-mère cylon.
La CAP est en route pour interception.
<i>Préparez la flotte à un saut d'urgence.</i>
J'arrive avec la Présidente.
Galactica, ici Apollo,
je suis en route vers le Vaisseau-mère,
<i>Kat est avec moi.</i>
<i>J'estime encore une minute
jusqu'à interception.</i>
<i>Reçu, Apollo.</i>
Les chasseurs d'alerte ont décollé
et couvriront vos arrières
dans trois minutes.
Rapport de situation.
Les chasseurs d'alerte ont été lancés.
Nouveaux contacts dradis,
ils lancent des Raiders.
Combien de temps avant notre saut ?
Encore deux minutes.
Monsieur...
Monsieur, je capte
des transpondeurs coloniaux.
Coloniaux ?
Merde, maintenant ils utilisent nos
propres signaux contre nous.
Peut-être.
N'ouvrez pas le feu.
Et mettez le saut en attente.
Encore un de vos tours ?
A tous les vaisseaux,
ici le Galactica,
saut en attente.
Je répète, saut en attente.
Vaisseau à vaisseau,
canal colonial prioritaire.
Envoyez un message de
sommation et identification
puis mettez la réponse
sur haut-parleurs.
Attention, bâtiment inconnu :
ici le Battlestar Galactica.
Identifiez-vous ou
nous ouvrirons le feu.
Leur portée est maintenant
de 1 700, Monsieur.
<i>Ici le Battlestar Pegasus</i>
<i>au vaisseau déclarant être le Galactica.</i>
<i>Répondez.</i>
Le Pegasus ?
Comment est-ce possible ?
La flotte entière a été détruite.
Donnez moi une liaison directe.
Pegasus, ici le commandant du Galactica.
Transmettez codes
d'identification immédiatement.
Monsieur,
je reçois des codes d'identification coloniaux.
Ils sont authentiques.
<i>Galactica, ici le commandant du Pegasus.</i>
<i>Adama, est-ce bien vous ?</i>
Amiral Cain.
Quel plaisir d'entendre votre voix.
Désengagez.
Red Team, désengagez.
Commandant,
je ne sais pas quoi dire.
C'est un miracle.
Vous m'ôtez les mots de la bouche.
Remettez la flotte en Condition 1.
<i>Galactica, ici Apollo,</i>
<i>vous n'allez pas croire ce que
je suis en train de voir.</i>
C'est comme un rêve.
C'est un rêve.

<i>Pegasus Raptor 861, ici Galactica.</i>
<i>Trains déployés, verrou sécurisé.</i>
<i>Bienvenue à bord, Amiral.</i>
Formez les rangs, tout le monde !
Grouillez-vous !
C'est pas la récré !
Allez, le groupe d'atterrissage est là.
Tenez-vous prêts.
Sympa de ta part d'être venue.
Pouvais pas être là trop tôt.
Groupe !
Garde-à-vous !
Amiral Cain,
bienvenue à bord du Galactica.
Commandant Adama,
c'est un honneur.
Permettez-moi de vous présenter
la Présidente des Colonies, Laura Roslin.
C'est une longue histoire.
Bienvenue.
Madame la Présidente.
C'est un plaisir.
De la part de tous les officiers
et de l'équipage du Pegasus,
c'est un plaisir de tous vous voir.
Bon retour dans la Flotte Coloniale.
Capitaine Taylor.
- Kara Thrace.
- Capitaine Taylor.
Amiral...
Énormément de questions me viennent
à l'esprit, ça vous gêne que je commence ?
Allez-y.
Comment nous avez-vous trouvés ?
Nous traquions une flotte cylon.
Nous essayions de prédire leurs mouvements,
qui semblaient aléatoires au début,
puis on a compris qu'ils sautaient vers
des systèmes aux ressources abondantes.
On est allés en reconnaissance
dans ces systèmes
espérant effectuer des raids
éclairs sur leur flotte.
Mais au lieu de trouver les Cylons,
on vous a trouvé.
Vous avez donc attaqué leur flotte ?
Vous savez ce qu'on dit de
la meilleure défense.
Comment avez-vous pu éviter
l'attaque cylon sur les Colonies ?
Un autre, s'il vous plait.
Le meilleur du Galactica.
Qui clôt la visite en beauté.
Merci.
Vous avez vu un vieux Battlestar,
vous les avez tous vus.
Ouais, il est bien vieux.
Etonnant que les Cylons ne vous aient pas
botté le cul
dans tous les sens avec cette poubelle.
Désolé.
A cause de ça,
vous passez votre tour.
On appontait au
chantier naval de Scorpion.
On s'apprêtait pour
une révision de trois mois.
La majeure partie de l'équipage
se préparait
à rejoindre leur famille
pour une permission longue durée.
Le XO avait le pont.
J'étais dans mes quartiers
j'emballais de la paperasse
et me préparais à rentrer à Tauron.
C'est là que les Cylons ont attaqué.
Ils ont frappé le chantier naval avec
trois ou quatre
bombes nucléaires.
Cinq vaisseaux,
dont deux Battlestars,
furent détruits instantanément.
Le temps d'arriver au CIC,
j'avais déjà perdu plus de 700 hommes.
Dieux.
On était sans défense.
J'ai donné l'ordre de sauter.
Vers où ?
N'importe où.
Nulle part.
On a juste sauté.
Un saut en aveugle.
Vous auriez pu atterrir n'importe où.
Décision audacieuse.
Manœuvre désespérée.
Pas d'autre choix.
Vous devez avoir une sacrée histoire
à raconter de votre côté.
Mais ne me la racontez pas maintenant.
Envoyez-moi votre journal de bord
à la première occasion.
Oui Madame.
Ça ne va pas ?
Non.
Il m'arrive parfois d'oublier le
protocole militaire.
L'amiral Cain est ma supérieure.
Elle prendra le contrôle total
de la flotte.
Je me demandais comment
aborder le sujet.
Croyez-moi, même si la hiérarchie
est stricte, elle n'est pas insensible.
Je ne le suis pas non plus.
C'est votre vaisseau.
Je n'ai aucune envie de m'immiscer dans
les affaires du Galactica.
J'apprécie cela, Amiral.
Mme la Présidente, on dirait
que je viens de tuer votre chien.
Non, c'est que....
C'est que le Commandant et moi
avons traversé tant de choses.
Excusez-moi.
Madame la Présidente.
Si vous voulez bien m'excuser.
Amiral, nous vous sommes
reconnaissants d'être ici.
Merci de nous avoir trouvés.
Madame la Présidente.
La Ministre de l'éducation ?
Elle a fait un long chemin.
J'en suis sûre.
Parlez-moi de l'Amiral Cain.
Ça reste entre officiers ?
Bien sûr.
On poursuivait ce qu'on pensait
être un petit
relais de communication cylon
Cible facile, non ?
Mais en fait, ça n'en était pas un.
C'était un point de ravitaillement
occupé par 15 escadres de Raiders.
l'Amiral Cain a ordonné à
notre XO d'attaquer.
Ils étaient très proches.
Ils avaient servi ensemble des années.
Seulement voilà...
Il a refusé l'ordre.
Amiral Cain.
Nous avons une prisonnière cylon à bord.
Vraiment ?
Nous avons un Cylon aussi.
La notre s'est relevée être
une bonne source d'information.
Elle a été très coopérative.
Le Vice Président, Dr. Baltar,
a travaillé avec elle.
Qu'a-t-elle fait ?
Elle lui a demandé son arme,
et lui a tiré dans la tête
devant tout l'équipage.
Alors elle s'est tournée vers moi.
Qu'avez-vous fait ?
J'ai lancé cette putain d'attaque.
Que faire d'autre ?
Non...
Non, non, je plaisante !
Je rigole, vous savez.
Ça ne me fait pas plaisir de prendre
le commandement, Bill.
Je veux que vous le sachiez.
Ne vous tracassez pas, Amiral.
C'est un tableau de chasse ?
Vous mettez des tableaux de chasse
sur vos Vipers ?
Comme si vous ne comptiez pas les points.
Je ne les peins par sur la coque comme si
je me la pétais devant tout l'univers.
Ça en fait 48 de tués là.
Impressionnant !
Vous avez aussi des casquettes
et des tee-shirts ?
Où est le CAG du Galactica ?
Ici même.
Venez me faire un topo
sur votre escadre, Capitaine.
Je vois que vous ne gardez pas
le compte des tués.
Vous devriez commencer.
Ça remonte le moral,
favorise la compétition
et l'esprit de corps.
C'est une façon de voir.
C'est la façon de voir de l'Amiral Cain.
Ça veut dire que c'est
votre façon de voir, Capitaine.
Le nom de mon commandant est Adama,
facile à mémoriser vu que c'est mon nom.
Ouais.
Je m'en souviendrai, fils à papa.
Voyons l'inventaire de votre artillerie.
Ils m'ont mis à la tête du projet Cylon.
Ma priorité est la détection des Cylons.
Nous avons notre propre prisonnier cylon.
J'aimerai que vous l'examiniez
dès que possible.
Voyez si on peut en tirer quelque chose.
Je me demande qui sera ce Cylon.
Un étranger,
un visage familier,
un ami fidèle qui tout à coup
s'avère être un ennemi ?
Avez-vous entendu ce que j'ai dit ?
Oui, oui.
Je serai ravi d'examiner le prisonnier.
Commandant.
- Amiral.
- Amiral, pardon.
Quelle horrible chose.
Pardon ?
Ça vous dérange si je jette un œil ?
Je suis Laird, Chef de pont du Pegasus.
Oui. Moi c'est Tyrol.
Merci pour les pièces envoyées.
Allez-y ne vous gênez pas.
Des DDG-62.
Mince !
J'ai conçu ces moteurs.
Je les pensais dépassés depuis 10 ans.
Vous êtes ingénieur aéronautique ?
Oui, je l'étais.
Puis la guerre est arrivée, et je me suis
retrouvé Chef de pont sur le Pegasus.
Vous êtes vraiment un civil ?
Comment c'est arrivé ?
J'étais sur le Scylla,
on a été recueillis par le Pegasus.
Ce sont des choses qui arrivent.
Je peux fouiner ici et là ?
On m'a dit que vous aviez conçu cela seul.
J'aimerais voir comment vous avez fait.
Oui, allez-y.
Le Pegasus a ravitaillé le Galactica
sur ses réserves pour nos opérations militaires.
Ce que j'approuve totalement,
mais quand la flotte
pourra-t-elle en profiter ?
L'Amiral Cain m'a assuré
que les ravitaillements arrivaient.
Bien, au moins elle prend vos appels.
Elle ne répond même pas aux miens.
Je lui en ferai part.
Comment prenez-vous tout cela ?
Elle est d'un grade supérieur.
C'est aussi simple que ça.
Vous savez, si le Président Adar était
sorti de ce Raptor, j'aurais été ravie,
reconnaissante que quelqu'un prenne
la relève. Et pourtant...
Je ne donne pas dans le "pourtant".
J'ai reçu des ordres toute ma carrière.
Il n'y a aucune différence.
Bien alors, Commandant, merci.
Nous apprécierons toute l'aide
que vous pourrez nous donner.
Vous l'aurez.
Vous m'aviez l'air saouls tous les deux.
Sans aucun doute.
Mais il ne mentait pas,
je peux te l'assurer.
Ne tire pas de conclusions hâtives.
Attends d'avoir tous les faits.
Le contexte est important.
Le contexte ?
Cette femme a tué un officier
devant l'équipage.
Nous avons abattu un transport civil,
avec plus d'un millier
de personnes à bord.
C'est écrit ici.
C'était complètement différent.
On ne sait pas s'ils étaient
à l'intérieur.
C'est pourquoi j'espère que l'Amiral
lit la totalité de nos registres,
et qu'elle comprend le contexte.
On devrait demander son journal de bord
à l'Amiral Cain,
juste pour la replacer dans son contexte.
Ça serait amusant !
Ne vous approchez pas trop.
Ça a tué sept de mes hommes.
Vous voulez que mes gardes
vous accompagnent ?
Tu as peur, Gaius ?
Tu veux que les grands méchants soldats
te protègent du vieux Cylon sournois ?
Non ça ira comme ça. Merci.
Oh, mon Dieu !
Mon Dieu, Gaius.
C'est moi.
Regarde ce qu'ils lui ont fait.
Ouvrez la porte, maintenant.
S'il vous plait.
<i>Identité confirmée. Lieutenant Thorne.</i>
Elle a dû lutter.
Elle a dû se défendre.
Ça ne justifie pas cela.
Arrête !
Bonjour ?
Bonjour, vous m'entendez ?
Elle a visiblement été violée,
torturée.
Oui.
Mais il n'y pas de signe clair
de traumatisme crânien.
Un réflexe oculomoteur
laisse penser qu'elle est consciente.
Tu ne peux pas cesser
d'être un scientifique un instant ?
Et voir la femme violée
qui gît là devant toi ?
Écoute,
Je sais que cela
doit être difficile pour toi.
Ne sois pas condescendant.
Je ne le suis pas, j'essaie
de te raisonner.
Si je dois l'aider,
je dois d'abord la comprendre.
Tu vas l'aider, Gaius ?
Je ferai tout ce que je peux.
Après tout,
elle ressemble beaucoup
à une personne qui m'est très chère.
Je pense qu'il serait préférable,
que tu nous laisses un petit moment.
Ça ne souffre d'aucune
blessure grave à la tête,
et donc d'aucun dégât physique neurologique
ou de ses centres cognitifs.
Mais c'est clairement traumatisé.
Ce qui me fait dire que ses problèmes
sont d'ordre psychologique.
Vous avez pensé à ça ? Non.
Cela montre que la conscience cylon
est sensible
aux mêmes pressions et failles
que le psychisme humain,
il peut être manipulé de la même manière.
En deux mots, Amiral,
vous avez déjà utilisé le bâton.
Il est temps d'essayer la carotte.
Fournissez au Docteur
tout ce dont il a besoin.
Oui, Madame.
Commandant, j'ai regardé votre journal.
Vous semblez avoir subi
de bien rudes épreuves.
On a aussi eu de bons moments.
Et bien, vous pouvez être fier de vous.
Merci, Amiral.
Comme je vous l'ai dit,
nous traquions une flotte cylon
quand nous avons trouvé le Galactica.
Et maintenant que j'ai pu comparer leur
itinéraire avec votre journal de bord.
Il est évident qu'ils étaient
en train de vous suivre.
Pour l'instant, nos reconnaissances
nous ont appris
que la flotte est composée de
deux Vaisseaux-mère,
d'une douzaine de vaisseaux de soutien
et d'un gros bâtiment que nous
n'avons pas pu identifier pour l'instant.
C'est ce gros vaisseau qui m'intéresse.
Quelle est sa fonction ?
Est-ce un vaisseau de commandement ?
Une fabrique de Raiders ?
Peut-être. Quoi que ce soit,
les Cylons le protègent.
C'est ce que j'appellerai :
"Une cible tentante".
Et moi qui me préparais
à vous sortir le grand jeu
sur le besoin de combiner nos ressources
en vue d'une attaque.
Une opportunité de frapper les Cylons
là où ça fait mal...
Avec plaisir.
Je vais faire en sorte qu'Apollo
se coordonne avec votre CAG.
Ce qui m'amène au sujet suivant,
Commandant.
Je vais fusionner les équipages.
Je vais commencer par réassigner le
Capitaine Adama à l'escadrille du Pegasus.
Mon équipe fonctionne très bien
telle qu'elle est.
Je vais vous parler franchement.
Après avoir examiné votre journal,
j'estime
qu'assigner votre fils au poste de CAG
du Galactica était une grave erreur.
Il a été indiscipliné,
voire rebelle et ce sont des citations
de votre journal, en passant.
Et je dois avouer qu'il n'est pas le seul
à avoir des problèmes disciplinaires.
Il y a cette Kara Thrace
qui "aurait frappé d'autres officiers
et désobéi aux ordres".
Ce Lieutenant Agathon qui a "fraternisé
et manifestement conçu un enfant
avec un agent ennemi".
Ne parlons même pas de votre XO.
Par conséquent...
Voici la liste complète des transferts.
J'avais cru que vous ne souhaitiez
pas interférer avec mon commandement.
Je suis en train de le sauver, Bill.
Vous êtes beaucoup trop proche
de ces officiers,
et vous ne voyez pas leurs faiblesses
et les dégâts qu'ils causent
à la cohésion et au moral.
Je ne suis pas d'accord.
C'est assurément votre droit.
Vous avez vos ordres.
Transféré sur le Pegasus ?
Pourquoi on devrait faire ça ?
Parce que ce sont les ordres.
On ne va pas la laisser bousiller notre tableau
de service la veille d'une opération cylon.
Conneries ! Elle essaye de nous baiser
parce que leur CAG a un balai dans le cul.
Ça suffit !
Vous êtes des officiers.
Agissez comme tels.
Elle vous a donné un ordre.
Vous allez l'exécuter.
- Permission de parler librement ?
- Non.
Nous avons tous pris l'habitude de plier
les règles, de faire à notre manière,
de négliger les choses.
Eh bien c'est fini.
Vous portez l'uniforme donc
vous acceptez les règles qui vont avec.
Vous avez été transférés.
Faites votre paquetage
et présentez-vous au CAG du Pegasus.
Rompez.
C'est une mission de reconnaissance
photographique.
On s'intéresse
à un vaisseau cylon en particulier
qui est plus gros
que tout ce qu'on a rencontré jusqu'ici.
D'après nos projections, ce système solaire
sera leur prochaine étape.
Nous allons
nous cacher derrière cette lune qui a une
traînée magnétique anormalement grande
et qui dissimulera nos signatures dradis.
On arrêtera les moteurs,
cachés près de la surface,
et on attendra que la flotte passe.
Starbuck ? Vous avez
quelque chose à ajouter ?
Votre plan est à chier.
Les Cylons ne sont pas stupides.
Cette lune est un angle mort.
Ils n'iront jamais là.
Vous voulez vraiment vous en approcher ?
Vous devez utiliser le vaisseau furtif
qu'on a construit sur le Galactica.
- La boîte de conserve faite maison ?
- Ça suffit.
Starbuck...
Vous ne faites plus partie
de cette mission.
Whiplash, Thumper,
préparez votre équipement optique.
Apollo, vous piloterez un Raptor avec moi.
D'après votre dossier, vous êtes habilité.
Vous vous rappelez comment le piloter ?
Oui, Monsieur.
Bien. Rompez.
Ils espèrent qu'on va se laisser faire ?
Maintenant tu conduis un putain de Raptor.
C'est humiliant.
C'est un équipement de surveillance ?
Va chercher le Blackbird. Prends de
jolies photos de notre vaisseau cylon.
Bien reçu.
A la vôtre !
- Où est le Blackbird ?
- Le Lt. Thrace l'a pris.
Elle a dit que l'Amiral Cain a ordonné
un contrôle de performances.
- Quoi ?
- Chef...
Vous méritez une putain de médaille.
Ça fait des mois qu'on a pas picolé.
C'est une putain de fête, ici.
J'ai entendu que vous vous étiez
même procuré un Cylon.
Même qu'elle serait carrément sexy aussi.
Moi aussi, j'aimerais bien
une tranche de Cylon.
Un peu de "Oh oui, oh oui !".
OK, vous savez quoi les mecs, ça suffit.
Fermez-la.
Susceptible !
Vous avez un faible
pour le petit robot, non ?
Qui êtes-vous ?
Vous vous souvenez...
Vous vous souvenez quand Thorne a mis ce
panneau "Dérangez, SVP" sur la cellule ?
- J'ai même remis le couvert.
- Oui, j'ai appris ça.
Tu te souviens qu'elle était allongée
- avec ce regard vide.
- Te gêne pas !
- Fougueuse !
- Ça fait mal.
Quelle est la fonction de ce vaisseau ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- Regarde de plus près.
Qu'est-ce qui le rend si important ?
Pourquoi y a-t-il deux Vaisseaux-mère
pour le protéger ?
Je ne sais...
Je ne sais pas.
Tu crois que Thorne
nous laissera l'essayer ?
Je l'ai entendu dire qu'il
allait devoir l'assouplir un peu avant.
Non, pas ici.
- C'est qui ce Thorne ?
- Lt. Thorne, Monsieur.
Interrogateur de Cylons.
Il leur en fait baver et les fait parler.
Votre petite robot va bien s'éclater.
Non, réfléchis un peu.
Faut qu'on y aille.
- C'est quoi ce bordel ?
- Tenez-la.
Non !
- Dégagez de là !
- Dégagez, dégagez !
Lâche-la !
Plus un geste !
Vous avez pas intérêt à bouger !
Ne bougez pas !
Vous avez pas intérêt à bouger !
Bougez pas.
A terre. A terre !
A genoux.
Les mains derrière la tête.
Maintenant !
Les mains derrière la tête.
Faites-le maintenant.
Maintenant !
Il est mort.
Pegasus, ici Raptor 923.
Nous avons décollé
<i>et nous sommes en route avec
les prisonniers et le corps du Lt. Thorne.
</i>
<i>ETA au Pegasus, trois minutes.
</i>
<i>L'agression s'est déroulée ici.</i>
<i>Ils devraient être traduits en court
martiale sur le Galactica.</i>
<i>Commandant, je suis
la plus haute autorité compétente ici</i>
et ils seront jugés sur le Pegasus.
<i>- Ce sont mes hommes.
- Un de mes hommes</i>
- est mort.
- Bien.
Nous avons tout deux de forts
ressentiments sur cette affaire
<i>qui soulignent la nécessité
d'un procès impartial.</i>
Vous voulez dire un
tribunal indépendant ?
<i>Parce que selon votre journal de bord,
Commandant,</i>
<i>vous avez dissous un tribunal indépendant
quand le verdict vous a déplu.</i>
Et si je ne me trompe pas,
Chef Tyrol y était en procès également.
C'était différent.
Oui, en effet.
Je vous recontacterai, Commandant. Merci.
Merci.
Maintenant,sortez.
La nourriture est pour vous.
Ce n'est pas une ruse.
Je ne vais pas vous l'enlever
à la dernière seconde.
Vous savez, je...
Je vais juste parler, maintenant.
Je ne mattends pas à ce que
vous disiez quoique ce soit.
Sur Caprica, avant l'attaque...
Et parfois, j'oublie qu'il
y avait une vie avant l'attaque.
Je connaissais quelqu'un.
Une femme, différente des autres
femmes que j'ai connues.
Elle était unique.
Belle.
Intelligente.
Extrêmement sensuelle.
Quand elle n'était pas dans mon lit,
elle était dans mes pensées.
Elle était un Cylon.
Et elle a véritablement
et fondamentalement changé ma vie.
En ce sens que je n'ai littéralement
jamais cessé de penser à elle,
parce que je l'aime.
Encore aujourd'hui, je l'aime.
Et elle vous ressemble trait pour trait.
Mon nom est Gaius Baltar,
et je suis là pour vous aider.
Vérifiez ces coordonnées de saut.
Désolé.
Coordonnées de saut vérifiées.
Vous semblez un peu distrait, Capitaine.
Une chose que je devrais savoir ?
Deux de mes amis viennent d'être
arrêtés et accusés de trahison.
Je vous suggère de classer ça
sous "pas votre problème".
Nous avons une mission de reconnaissance
à effectuer, restez concentré.
D'accord.
Pegasus, ici Blue Team.
Coordonnées de saut prêtes
et vérifiées.
Nous sauterons dans 10 minutes
à mon signal. Maintenant.
Des nouvelles du Chef, Monsieur ?
Il va passer en jugement.
C'est un homme bien, Monsieur.
<i>- Je sais. Je vais faire...
- Passez le mot au Cmd Adama,</i>
<i>contactez le CIC dès que possible.</i>
- Ici Adama.
- Je viens de parler à Fisk.
- Le procès en court martiale est terminé.
- Terminé ?
Quand a-t-il commencé ?
<i>Je ne sais pas.</i>
Mais toutes les charges ont été retenues.
Elle va les exécuter pour
meurtre et trahison.
Je veux une équipe d'assaut dans
un Raptor dans 5 minutes.
Préparez le lancement
des chasseurs d'alerte.
- Vous avez du travail.
- Monsieur.
Pegasus, ici Galactica.
Sécurisez un canal SVP.
Le Cmd. Adama aimerait parler à l'Amiral Cain.
<i>Allez-y Monsieur.</i>
Vous m'aviez promis un procès équitable.
Quel genre de procès ont-ils eu ?
<i>Je vous assure que je les ai écoutés
jusqu'au bout.</i>
J'ai confronté leurs déclarations
à celles des gardes
et tenu compte de leurs
recommandations et états de service.
C'était une décision difficile
mais j'ose dire qu'elle est juste.
Ils ont le droit de se faire entendre
par un jury.
<i>Je suis l'officier commandant</i>
<i>en service détaché en temps de guerre.</i>
Le règlement me donne
toute autorité à cet égard.
Lancez les chasseurs.
Vous pouvez me citer tous
les règlements que vous voulez.
Je ne vous laisserai pas
exécuter mes hommes.
Je vous recommande vivement
de reconsidérer cette déclaration.
Amiral, le Galactica lance
des Vipers et un Raptor.
Commandant ?
Pourquoi lancez-vous vos Vipers ?
Prenez vos dispositions
pour que le Chef Tyrol
<i>et le Lt. Agathon soient
remis à mes marines</i>
dès qu'ils arriveront.
- Je ne reçois pas d'ordre de vous.
- Appelez ça comme vous voulez.
Je récupère mes hommes.
Quelle erreur vous faites.
<i>Je récupère...</i>
mes hommes.
Postes de combat.
Amiral, ça va vite devenir
hors de contrôle.
Lancez les Vipers d'alerte.
Adama a dépassé la limite.
Il ne me laisse pas le choix.
Lancez les Vipers d'alerte.
<i>A SUIVRE...

Ici le Battlestar Pegasus au vaisseau
déclarant ętre le Galactica, répondez.
Le Pegasus...
Comment est-ce possible ?
Toute la flotte a été détruite.
Amiral Cain.
De la part de tous les officiers
et de l'équipage du Pegasus,
bon retour dans la Flotte Coloniale.
La flotte cylon est composée de
deux Vaisseaux-mčre,
d'une douzaine de vaisseaux de soutien
et d'un gros bâtiment que nous
n'avons pas encore pu identifier.
C'est ce gros vaisseau qui m'intéresse.
Je vais fusionner les équipages.
Je croyais que vous ne souhaitiez
pas interférer avec mon commandement.
Je suis Laird, Chef de pont du Pegasus.
Vous ętes ingénieur aéronautique ?
- Oui, je l'étais.
- Alors vous ętes vraiment un civil ?
J'étais sur le Scylla.
On a été recueillis par le Pegasus.
Ce sont des choses qui arrivent.
Combien de temps il me reste ?
Quelques semaines. Un mois tout au plus.
Je pourrais travailler ?
Sauf si le cancer atteint le cerveau.
Si cela arrive, vous...
Nous avons notre propre prisonnier cylon.
Elle a visiblement été violée, torturée.
Tu vas l'aider, Gaius ?
Vous voulez vraiment vous en approcher ?
Vous devez utiliser le vaisseau furtif
construit sur le Galactica.
Du composite de carbone.
Il va ętre coton ŕ repérer sur le dradis.
Starbuck, vous ne faites plus partie
de cette mission.
Un équipement de surveillance ?
Va chercher le Blackbird. Prends de
jolies photos de notre vaisseau cylon.
- C'est qui ce Thorne ?
- Lt. Thorne, Monsieur.
Votre petit robot va bien s'éclater.
Lâche-la !
Vous n'avez pas intéręt ŕ bouger !
Ne bougez pas !
Toutes les charges ont été retenues.
Elle va les exécuter pour
meurtre et trahison.
Amiral, le Galactica lance
des Vipers et un Raptor.
Pourquoi lancez-vous vos Vipers ?
Je récupčre mes hommes.
Lancez les Vipers d'alerte.
<i>Galactica, ici Kat. Des Vipers du Pegasus
foncent droit sur moi.</i>
<i>Demande instructions.</i>
Vous devez les laisser se défendre.
Nous devrions pointer
nos batteries principales sur eux.
<i>FLOTTE CYLON
MISSION DE RECONNAISSANCE</i>
<i>Galactica, ici Kat. Demande permission
de tirer. Nous avons besoin de votre aide.</i>
<i>Kat, ici le Galactica. Ne tirez que
s'ils vous tirent dessus.</i>
<i>Je répčte. Ne tirez que
s'ils vous tirent dessus.</i>
Galactica, ici Kat !
Ils nous emmerdent vraiment lŕ.
<i>Galactica, ici Hot Dog.</i>
J'ai un créneau de tir sur l'un d'eux.
<i>Ils sont ŕ portée, je les accroche.</i>
<i>Galactica, restez...</i>
<i>Hot Dog, ŕ six heures,
il est juste derričre toi.</i>
<i>Manśuvre d'évasion, allez !</i>
<i>Putain d'enculés !</i>
OK, tu vas devoir
virer de bord maintenant.
<i>Narcho, ici le Pegasus.
Ne tirez pas en premier.</i>
<i>Stinger, ici le Pegasus.
Relevez le Capitaine Adama de ses fonctions</i>
<i>et aidez l'attaque sur le Galactica.</i>
Votre arme, Capitaine. Vous ętes relevé.
- Permission d'aller ŕ l'arričre.
- Accordée.
<i>Il est juste au-dessus de moi.</i>
<i>Viper 1, Viper 1.
Vous ętes beaucoup trop prčs.</i>
Allez, tourne.
Putain ! Ils nous encerclent.
Galactica. Demande permission de tirer.
<i>Ils vont faire un autre passage.</i>
<i>Je répčte. Demande permission de tirer.</i>
Allez, Starbuck.
Dis-moi que t'es dans le coin.
C'est quoi tout ça ?
<i>Réception de données cryptées
Starbuck es-tu lŕ ? Apollo.</i>
Starbuck...
Je suis lŕ.
Qu'est ce que c'est ce bordel ?
Contact dradis !
Un seul contact presque ŕ notre verticale.
Identification !
Pas de transpondeur,
aucun code de reconnaissance.
Ça doit ętre un Raider cylon.
Amiral, ça doit ętre un Raider.
Comment a-t-il bien pu s'approcher
aussi prčs sans ętre détecté ?
Je ne sais pas monsieur, je vous assure
qu'il vient de nulle part.
D'accord.
Rappelez les Vipers.
Faites approcher le vaisseau.
Et préparez vous ŕ attaquer l'ennemi.
<i>A tous les Vipers du Pegasus,
rappel d'urgence.</i>
<i>Il y a un Raider cylon ŕ votre verticale.</i>
<i>A tous les Vipers du Galactica,</i>
<i>un Raider Cylon arrive droit sur vous.</i>
T'es lŕ sale connard. Suivez-moi !
Sur la droite, pleine puissance,
on monte !
Starbuck ŕ tous les Vipers, ne tirez pas !
Je répčte, ne tirez pas !
Je suis une amie, OK ?
On est tous amis.
Alors soyons...
tous amis...
Ce n'est pas un Raider.
C'est votre vaisseau furtif.
Qui le pilote ?
Il n'a pas été autorisé ŕ voler.
Vous m'avez eu.
Je ne suis qu'un simple passager ici.
Galactica, ici Kat.
<i>Galactica, c'est le Blackbird.</i>
<i>Je répčte, c'est le Blackbird.</i>
Qu'est-ce que fout le Blackbird dehors ?
C'est Starbuck.
Elle a décollé avec il y a 2 heures.
Elle disait faire des tests de vol
pour l'Amiral Cain.
Ça n'y ressemble pas.
Encore une de ses cascades de cinglée.
Dieux merci.
A qui le dites-vous ?
Appelez le Pegasus.
Ici le commandant du Pegasus, ŕ vous.
Vous pouvez vous retirer
ou bien nous pouvons nous tirer dessus.
C'est vous qui voyez.
Amiral.
Une minute.
Nous recevons des données, Amiral.
C'est la flotte cylon.
Ça vient de
notre mission de reconnaissance ?
Non monsieur. Cette mission a été annulée.
Ça vient du Blackbird.
Thrace...
Elle a rempli la mission de reconnaissance
toute seule.
Dieux, regarde ces clichés, Jack.
Elle a mis son nez juste au-dessus de leurs
fesses et ils ne l'ont męme pas remarquée.
Amiral, le Commandant Adama
est toujours en ligne
et nos vaisseaux attendent
toujours leurs instructions.
Doivent-ils reprendre l'attaque ?
D'accord, retraite mutuelle.
Nos deux vaisseaux repassent
en Condition 2.
Ensuite je veux que vous me fassiez
un rapport en personne.
Je n'ai pas l'intention
de moisir en cellule.
Bien...
Terrain neutre, le Colonial One.
Pas d'escorte.
Soyez-y dans 15 minutes.
Repassez en Condition 2.
Te voilŕ...

49 604 SURVIVANTS
A LA RECHERCHE D'UN FOYER
APPELÉ LA TERRE.
Synchro :
Dapitch, Green Fruit, Kotaro, Nikomagnus
Trad/relecture : Dapitch-Goufrach-Green_Fruit
Lama-Nikomagnus-The Cole-Zed'family
Commençons par admettre
une horrible vérité.
Ce qui est arrivé aujourd'hui résulte
d'une défaillance du commandement
de chacun d'entre nous.
Nous sommes
les dirigeants de cette flotte.
A ce titre, nous devons
montrer l'exemple.
Nous ne pouvons pas continuer
ŕ laisser les conflits entre nous...
Venons-en aux faits, voulez-vous ?
Deux de ses hommes ont assassiné
un de mes officiers
pour protéger un Cylon.
Ils sont coupables, ils l'ont admis.
Et conformément au rčglement,
j'ai toute autorité
pour les juger, les déclarer
coupables et les condamner.
Et nous savons toutes les deux que
la sentence pour ce crime est la mort.
Je pense, Amiral...
que l'esprit des lois requičre
plus qu'une exécution sommaire.
C'est ça que vous avez fait
pendant ces 6 derniers mois ?
Débattre des subtilités
de la loi coloniale ?
Réveillez-vous ! Nous sommes en guerre !
Et nous ne pouvons nous payer le luxe
de discussions théoriques sur ce sujet.
Vous voulez faire court, d'accord.
Vous commandez le Pegasus,
lui le Galactica.
Deux puissants vaisseaux de guerre,
lourdement armés.
Et je ne doute pas que le
Pegasus remporterait la bataille.
Je ne compterais pas trop lŕ-dessus.
Il y aurait certainement de gros dégâts
et vous subiriez de lourdes pertes.
Donc vous pouvez repartir d'ici
combattre le Galactica,
ou vous pouvez transiger.
Et ce sont les deux seules
options disponibles. Point final.
Je ne comprends pas comment vous deux
avez pu survivre si longtemps.
D'accord.
Le Lieutenant Thrace m'a envoyé des
informations de reconnaissance détaillées
sur la flotte cylon.
Je veux cette flotte.
Et j'ai besoin du Galactica pour l'avoir.
Je suis donc disposée ŕ aller jusque lŕ.
Je suspendrai l'exécution
jusqu'ŕ la fin de l'attaque.
Je veux mes hommes sur le Galactica.
Je n'ai rien ŕ foutre
de ce que vous voulez...
Vous avez une putain de chance de ne
pas assister ŕ votre propre exécution.
La destruction de la flotte cylon
devient donc la priorité absolue.
Ensuite nous nous retrouverons ici
et nous résoudrons ce problčme.
Merci.
Repos Lieutenant. Approchez.
Il semble que vous ayez
eu une sacrée journée.
Je vous nomme Capitaine,
et vous devenez le CAG du Pegasus.
Vous me montez en grade ?
J'ai besoin d'un CAG avec
du cran et de l'initiative,
pour planifier et mener l'attaque
contre cette flotte.
Je pensais que Stinger en était capable
mais il a laissé le Capitaine Adama
vous contacter
et réaliser cette opération
juste sous son nez, donc, il est viré.
Et le Capitaine Adama, Madame ?
Je dois avouer avoir été ŕ "ça"
de le jeter en cellule.
Mais je ne pouvais pas vraiment l'inculper
et pas vous, donc
j'ai juste annulé son statut de vol.
Je le veux dans mon équipe, Madame.
Vous obtenez toujours
ce que vous voulez ?
La plupart du temps, Madame.
Bien,
moi aussi.
D'accord, vous pouvez l'avoir.
J'ai entendu que vous vouliez
retourner sur Caprica.
Oui, Madame.
Nous y avons des gens encore en vie.
Oui, et ils méritent d'ętre secourus.
Je suis tout ŕ fait d'accord.
En fait, j'irai plus loin...
Je dirai que notre but ultime
est de retourner sur les Colonies pour
déloger ces putains de Cylons de nos foyers.
Qu'en pensez-vous Capitaine ?
Je pense que c'est la meilleure idée
que j'ai entendu aujourd'hui, Madame.
J'ai bien peur que ça ne puisse
finir que d'une façon.
Vous devez la tuer.
Mais de quoi parlez-vous ?
Comme elle l'a dit, venons-en aux faits.
Vous étiez tous deux pręts ŕ
vous battre aujourd'hui.
Pensez vous qu'elle va abandonner ?
Elle va choisir son moment,
et vous frapper ŕ la premičre occasion.
C'est certain.
Je déteste dire cela devant vous,
mais elle est dangereuse.
et tout ce que vous pouvez faire, c'est
la frapper avant qu'elle ne vous frappe.
Je ne suis pas un assassin.
Non,
vous n'ętes pas un assassin,
vous ętes un officier colonial...
qui a fait serment de
protéger cette flotte.
Selon vous, que va-t-elle
faire des civils
une fois qu'elle vous aura éliminé ?
Vous savez que j'ai raison.
Mais vous ne voulez pas vous l'avouer.
Tout le monde a donc perdu la tęte ?
Vos niveaux de fluide
et d'électrolytes sont stables.
Je pense que le bébé va bien,
mais vous avez une côte cassée.
C'est une fracture sérieuse : ça va faire
un mal de chien pour un moment.
Mais je ne vois aucun signe de dommage
permanent dű ŕ l'agression.
"L'agression."
Ça s'appelle comme ça maintenant ?
Ils n'étaient pas du Galactica.
Ils étaient du Pegasus.
Et alors ?
Et pour Helo et le Chef ?
J'ai entendu dire
qu'on allait les exécuter.
Je ne le permettrai pas.
Comment allez-vous faire ?
Ce n'est pas l'Amiral Cain
qui commande ?
- Ce qui vous est arrivé...
- Est impardonnable.
est arrivé sur mon vaisseau,
sous ma garde.
J'en suis responsable.
Je tiens donc ŕ m'en
excuser personnellement.
Assurez-vous qu'elle va bien,
puis qu'elle retourne dans sa cellule.
On est pas censés ętre morts ?
L'exécution aurait dű
avoir lieu il y a une heure.
Je ne me plains pas.
<i>Identité confirmée.</i>
Alors, jusqu'oů va votre stupidité ?
Plus loin qu'on ne peut imaginer.
Il se passe quoi, Capitaine ?
Bonne nouvelle : vous n'ętes
pas morts... Pas encore.
Mauvaise nouvelle :
c'est un report, pas une grâce.
Il va y avoir une grosse opération. Les
exécutions sont suspendues jusqu'ŕ sa fin.
Le commandant a bataillé pour vous.
Et bien plus encore.
On était ŕ ça d'une guerre
avec le Pegasus.
- Putain.
- Mais qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- Ce sont pas les Cylons, les ennemis ?
- Maintenant c'est nous.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas, Gaius ?
Rien.
Je crois que...
j'ai perdu l'intéręt.
- En moi ?
- Non, pas en toi, en...
En ça, en cet endroit.
Ça ne me manque plus vraiment.
Tu sais ce qui me manque ?
Le sport.
Tu plaisantes.
Non.
J'allais au stade de Pyramide
juste avant la partie.
J'achetais 2 billets au noir.
Si je calculais bien,
j'arrivais juste au coup de sifflet.
Je m'asseyais et laissais l'énergie
de la foule passer ŕ travers moi.
Vague aprčs vague d'émotion.
Comme une décharge électrique.
Pourquoi tu prenais deux billets ?
Un pour moi et un pour toi.
Je savais que tu n'irais pas.
Le Pyramide était bien trop
populaire pour toi, mais...
J'ai toujours aimé sentir
que tu étais avec moi.
<i>Identité confirmée.</i>
Bien, je vois que ça a mangé.
C'est un progrčs, j'imagine.
Vous pouvez lui faire faire
une pirouette ? Supplier ?
Voyez ce que ça peut dire lŕ-dessus.
Avant, cette chose
s'asseyait ŕ notre table,
mangeait nos repas
et écoutait nos histoires.
N'est-ce pas ?
Tu t'asseyais...
Tu nous écoutais, en te disant
notre amie, n'est-ce pas ?
Amiral, s'il vous plaît !
Tout contact physique avec le sujet
réduira mes progrčs ŕ néant.
Renseignez-vous sur ce vaisseau.
Je veux mourir.
Vous m'y aiderez ?
Vous me tuerez, s'il vous plaît ?
Je ne gčre pas encore toutes
vos méthodes de travail
mais je pense qu'on aura tous nos oiseaux
dans les airs pour l'attaque. Pour sűr.
Je veux dire... Oui Monsieur.
Merci, Chef.
Cally.
Laird n'est pas militaire, non ?
Non, Monsieur.
Il était ingénieur civil en aéronautique
sur un vaisseau appelé...
- Le Scylla...
- Civil ?
Savez-vous comment
il est arrivé sur le Pegasus ?
On raconte que le Pegasus
avait une flotte civile
mais il leur est arrivé quelque chose.
Merci.
Le vaisseau de Laird était le Scylla.
Le Scylla était...
un transporteur civil.
On l'a trouvé ainsi que...
quelques autres vaisseaux civils
environ une semaine aprčs l'attaque.
C'était de bons vaisseaux.
Moteurs FTL et męme de l'armement.
Autant de pičces détachées
potentielles pour le Pegasus.
Donc... L'amiral a pris une décision.
Les besoins militaires
sont prioritaires.
Vous les avez dépouillés.
Vous avez démonté les vaisseaux
pour les pičces ?
Sainte Mčre d'Artémis.
Combien de matériel avez-vous pris ?
Vous avez pris leurs moteurs FTL ?
- Abandonné ces gens lŕ-bas ?
- Non, pas du tout.
L'amiral Cain a étudié
la liste des passagers
et a décidé de qui
pouvait ętre utile ou pas.
Le Scylla a été le plus coriace.
Laird et quinze autres hommes
et femmes, ils avaient tous...
Tous voyageaient avec leur famille,
femmes, maris, enfants.
Les appelés...
ont refusé d'y aller.
Ils ont résisté.
Alors l'ordre est tombé
d'abattre la famille de
quiconque refusait de venir.
Nous l'avons fait.
Deux familles.
On les a alignés contre la cloison.
Et on les a abattus.
Le travail du CAG n'est jamais fini.
Salut. Comment vas-tu ?
A part le fait d'avoir été rétrogradé ?
De me retrouver subalterne ŕ
un de mes pilotes ?
Bien. On ne peut mieux.
Tu sais que je n'ai rien
ŕ voir avec ça, hein ?
Je n'ai jamais cru le contraire.
Je viens d'aller voir Helo et Tyrol.
Ils tiennent le coup pour le moment.
Bien.
Aide-moi ŕ organiser cette opération.
Je suis bloquée devant
ce tableau de service.
Tu veux continuer ?
Comme si rien ne s'était passé ?
Lee, elle a le commandement,
qu'est-ce que tu veux faire ?
On ne peut rien faire.
J'ai pensé que vous aimeriez
avoir des habits propres.
Etiez-vous consciente de votre véritable
nature de Cylon avant de monter ŕ bord ?
Ou vous décririez-vous
comme agent dormant ?
Je savais ce que j'étais.
J'étais un soldat. J'avais une mission,
je l'ai accomplie.
Je pensais que cela fait,
j'allais mourir.
Que vous me tueriez.
Puis je...
Puis je me serais transférée
dans un nouveau corps...
Réincarnée.
Mais vous ne m'avez pas tuée.
Ce que vous m'avez fait...
Ce qu'ils vous ont fait est mal.
Affreux.
Mais je ne suis pas l'un d'eux.
Vous devez me croire.
Ça va aller mieux pour vous.
A partir de maintenant.
Je le promets.
Je ne veux pas que ça aille mieux.
Je veux mourir.
Mais vous savez que
vous ne pouvez pas mourir.
Vous le savez, non ?
Votre conscience va juste se transférer
et vous vous réveillerez
dans un nouveau corps.
Pas si vous détruisez ça.
Comment, ça...
Ce vaisseau ?
Dites-moi.
En quoi est-il si important ce vaisseau ?
Les Cylons l'appellent
leur vaisseau de résurrection.
En ce moment, nous sommes trop loin
de la plančte des Cylons
pour que le transfert fonctionne.
C'est pourquoi ils ont construit ce vaisseau.
Il renferme l'équipement complet
nécessaire ŕ la résurrection des Cylons.
Ce vaisseau...
voyage avec la flotte suivant la piste
du Galactica durant ces derniers mois.
C'est donc un filet de sécurité ?
Un endroit oů ils se retirent
quand ils meurent.
Et s'ils perdent leur filet de sécurité ?
Alors tout Cylon qui meure ici...
Serait mort.
Mais vraiment mort.
J'imagine qu'ils n'aimeraient pas ça.
Non, Madame.
Ils pourraient męme arręter de nous
poursuivre. Pourquoi risquer d'ętre tué
si on ne peut pas se réveiller en pleine
forme dans un corps tout neuf ?
Je pense que vous venez d'identifier
le vaisseau le plus
important de la galaxie.
J'ai de bons jours et d'autres moins mais
n'ayez pas l'air si inquiet,
je ne vais pas mourir aujourd'hui.
Désolé.
Que puis-je pour vous ?
Vous aviez raison au sujet de Cain.
Une flotte civile suivait le Pégasus,
15 vaisseaux.
Cain les a dépouillés.
De leurs pičces, de leurs réserves...
du personnel.
J'aimerais dire que cela m'étonne,
mais c'est tout ŕ fait elle.
Elle manśuvre pour le pouvoir,
vous devriez faire de męme.
Que vous est-il arrivé ?
Vous ętes devenue si sanguinaire.
Tant que Cain est vivante,
vous ętes en danger. J'en suis sűr.
Qu'est-ce qui vous ferait plaisir ?
Un nouveau corps.
Peut-ętre un de ces jeunes modčles cylons
du vaisseau de résurrection.
Je ne vous vois pas en blonde.
Je suis pleine de surprise.
On se voit demain ?
Commandant.
Elle vous tuera sans hésiter.
Ne la laissez pas faire.
Vous savez, quand on
sera sortis d'affaire...
Je ferai quelques changements.
Ah ouais ?
Comme quoi ?
Entre Sharon et moi.
C'est fini.
C'est vraiment terminé.
Je ne peux plus continuer.
Comprenez-moi bien.
Lt., ce que nous venons de faire.
Je le referais...
sans sourciller.
Mais je dois la laisser partir.
J'ai bien réfléchi,
je dois la laisser.
Oui.
Je te comprends.
Vous ?
Oui, moi.
Pourquoi ?
Tu crois que je n'ai jamais de remords ?
Tu crois que je ne me demande
jamais si je deviens taré.
Je suis amoureux d'une femme
qui n'en est pas une.
Je vais avoir un bébé qui sera...
quoi ?
A moitié machine ?
Vous ętes vraiment amoureux d'elle, hein ?
Ouais.
Oui, je l'aime.
Et je ne peux pas m'en défaire.
Mais si vous le pouvez,
faites-le.
Notre objectif principal est un vaisseau
appelé "Resurrection" par les Cylons.
Il est protégé par 2 Vaisseaux-mčres
qui nous ont suivi ŕ travers ce secteur.
Notre plan,
en gros,
c'est de les laisser nous trouver.
Nous les attendrons ici dans ce systčme,
faisant croire ŕ une opération miničre.
Quand les Cylons lanceront leurs Raiders,
le Galactica et la plupart des civils sauteront.
Un petit groupe de civils
sera laissé en arričre.
Pour les Cylons, ils auront l'air
d'avoir des problčmes avec leur FTL
en essayant de fuir en vitesse subluminique.
Les Raiders cylons pourchassent
les appâts civils
qui les attirent le plus loin possible
des Vaisseaux-Mčres.
Une fois les Raiders éloignés
par les leurres,
Le Galactica et le Pegasus sauteront
et attaqueront les Vaisseaux-mčres.
Simultanément, je ferai un saut
avec le vaisseau furtif Blackbird.
Je mettrai le FTL du Resurrection
hors service, pour éviter qu'il prenne la fuite.
Pourquoi ne pas équiper le Blackbird
d'une ogive, et le détruire dčs le début ?
Nous avons fait des simulations.
Nous pensons que les Cylons
détecteraient des tętes nucléaires
et détruiraient le Blackbird
avant qu'il ne soit ŕ portée de tir.
Une fois le FTL détruit
les Battlestars attaqueront
les Vaisseaux-mčres.
et nos groupes d'assaut s'occuperont
du Resurrection.
Combien d'escadrilles ?
Toutes.
Il y a un problčme, Commandant ?
J'ai besoin de temps pour
examiner les détails de l'opération.
Comme vous voulez.
J'ai vérifié tous les détails
et ça me convient.
J'ai besoin de votre CAG pour
répondre ŕ quelques questions.
Une heure, Thrace.
Oui, Amiral.
Reste concentré, fils.
Jack, je veux transférer un détachement
de marines sur le Galactica.
Vous les choisirez personnellement.
J'en veux des totalement fiables.
Entičrement loyaux.
Des lames de rasoir.
J'ai une mission pour toi, Kara.
Tout ce que vous voulez, vous le savez.
N'accepte pas trop rapidement.
Tu n'aimeras pas celle-lŕ.
Moi je ne l'aime pas.
Mais j'ai décidé que cela devait ętre fait.
Je vous transfčre aussi sur le Galactica.
Je dirai ŕ Adama que vous y serez
mes yeux et mes oreilles.
Il détestera ça.
Il pensera que vous ętes mon espion et
cherchera ŕ vous écarter des décisions.
Mais il acceptera.
Je veux que vous restiez au CIC
pendant l'attaque.
Restez prčs d'Adama.
Une fois l'attaque terminée
et le compte rendu des pilotes effectué
Je veux que tu te poses
sur le Pegasus pour faire ton rapport
directement au CIC.
Tu prendras Lee avec toi.
Il surveillera tes arričres.
Mettez des marines a chaque endroit clé
et postez un escadron juste devant le CIC.
Il y aura l'habituelle agitation
des esprits aprčs l'attaque.
Tout le monde se félicitera de la victoire.
- Ils baisseront leur garde.
- La sécurité sera faible.
Je te demanderai ŕ la radio.
Je vous contacterai directement.
Quand je vous aurai en ligne
et j'ordonnerai :
"exécuter le cas orange"...
Lorsque je dirai "ruine"...
Vous ordonnerez aux marines
d'abattre le commandement d'Adama.
Commencez par Adama.
Tu sortiras ton arme
et tu tireras une balle
dans la tęte de l'Amiral Cain.
A SUIVRE...
LES CYLONS FURENT
CRÉÉS PAR L'HOMME
ILS ÉVOLUÈRENT
ILS SE RÉVOLTÈRENT
IL Y A DE NOMBREUSES COPIES
ET ILS ONT UN PLAN.
<i>Précédemment dans Battlestar Galactica</i>
Je vous nomme Capitaine.
Vous devenez le CAG du Pegasus.
Vous me montez en grade ?
J'ai besoin d'un CAG
avec du cran.
Nous sommes
les dirigeants de cette flotte.
A ce titre, nous devons
montrer l'exemple.
Venons-en aux faits, voulez-vous ?
Deux de ses hommes ont assassiné
un de mes officiers
pour protéger un Cylon.
Ils sont coupables. Ils l'ont admis.
Et conformément au règlement,
j'ai toute autorité
pour les juger, les déclarer
coupables et les condamner.
Et nous savons toutes les deux que
la sentence pour ce crime est la mort.
J'ai bien peur que ça ne puisse finir
que d'une façon. Vous devez la tuer.
Bien, je vois que ça a mangé.
C'est un progrès, j'imagine.
Vous pouvez lui faire faire
une pirouette ? Supplier ?
Amiral, s'il vous plaît !
J'ai pensé que vous aimeriez
avoir des habits propres.
Tu sais ce qui me manque ?
Le sport.
J'allais au stade de Pyramide
juste avant la partie.
J'achetais 2 billets au noir.
Un pour moi et un pour toi.
J'ai toujours aimé sentir
que tu étais avec moi.
Les Cylons l'appellent
leur vaisseau de résurrection.
En ce moment, nous sommes trop loin
de la planète des Cylons
pour que le transfert fonctionne.
Ils ont donc construit ce vaisseau.
Il renferme l'équipement complet
nécessaire à la résurrection des Cylons.
Alors tout Cylon qui meure ici...
Serait mort.
Mais vraiment mort.
Notre objectif principal est un vaisseau
appelé "Resurrection" par les Cylons.
Notre plan est de sauter avec
le chasseur furtif Blackbird
et mettre le FTL du Resurrection
hors service, pour éviter qu'il ne fuie.
Une fois le FTL détruit, nos groupes
d'assaut s'occuperont du Resurrection.
Combien d'escadrilles ?
Toutes.
Jack, je veux transférer un détachement
de marines sur le Galactica.
J'ai une mission pour toi, Kara.
Tout ce que vous voulez, vous le savez.
Mettez des marines à chaque endroit clé.
Je te demanderai à la radio.
Je vous contacterai directement.
Quand je vous aurai en ligne
et que vous m'entendrez ordonner :
"exécuter le cas orange",
vos ordres seront de mettre fin
au commandement d'Adama.
Commencez par Adama.
Tu sortiras ton arme
et tu tireras une balle
dans la tête de l'Amiral Cain.
48H PLUS TÔT
C'est une saloperie de truc
qu'on m'a demandée de faire.
Mais tuer est notre métier.
On nous dit "tirez", on tire.
Donc tu vas le faire ?
Ouais, je vais le faire.
Kara...
Je pourrais avoir besoin de renforts.
Je comprendrai si tu peux pas.
Tu me connais mieux que ça.
Ouais, c'est vrai.
Les gens ont besoin de ça, Kara.
La confiance.
Ta parole
et ma parole.
Sans ça...
On n'est pas vraiment différents
des Cylons.
Merci.
Regarde ça.
Les Castors Junior arrivent.
Celui que t'as tué, a sauvé
ma vie et celle de 50 autres gars,
sale enfoiré.
Pour toi,
c'est "Monsieur".
Oui, Monsieur.
J'imagine que la robot vous a bien huilé
le manche à tous les deux ?
Je suis désolé. Je crois pas
avoir bien entendu.
C'est la vitre. Je vous entends pas.
Pourquoi vous ouvrez pas la porte.
Entrez,
et on pourra en parler.
C'est une super idée, Chef.
Ils veulent vraiment le faire.
Les mains sur la tête.
- Du calme !
- A genoux ! Sur vos putains de genoux !
On se calme.
Réfléchissez à ce que vous faites.
Réfléchissez à ce qu'on fait là, les mecs.
C'est quoi ce bordel ?
Ne vous inquiétez pas Monsieur.
On va y aller bien lentement, Monsieur.

Tu vois, le bide,
c'est un endroit sensible.
Le Lt. Thorne me l'a dit un jour.
Si tu veux faire bien mal
sans laisser de marques,
vise le bide.
C'est surprenant ce qu'on peut faire
avec les choses les plus simples.
Du savon,
une bonne vieille serviette.
Ça peut pas faire mal, hein ?
Tu vas être surpris.
Lâches.
Lâches ?
C'est ça que t'as dit ?
Passe-moi ça.
Vous savez, j'ai menti.
Je vais plus y aller lentement.
Colonel sur le pont !
Gage, Vireem !
Sortez de la cellule,
et au garde à vous !
Ici !
Détachez les prisonniers.
Technicien Gage,
laissez-moi vous poser une question.
Ces hommes portent-ils
l'uniforme colonial ?
Oui, Monsieur.
Technicien Vireem, êtes-vous d'accord
avec le technicien Gage
sur le fait que ce sont
effectivement des officiers coloniaux ?
Oui, Monsieur.
- Ils ont tué le lieutenant...
- Fermez vos putains de gueule !
Je ne suis pas certain de comprendre
ce que je viens de voir.
Car il me semble avoir vu
vous deux les matelots
traiter ces hommes comme des Cylons
ce qui est évidemment faux parce que
si c'était le cas,
vous seriez tous deux coupables
d'attaque sur un chef et un lieutenant
sous notre protection
en temps de guerre.
Ce qui si je ne me trompe pas,
est passible, sur ce vaisseau,
d'une peine très lourde.
Allez, dégagez d'ici.
- Monsieur.
- Monsieur.
Sortez de là.
Oui, Monsieur.
Monsieur.
Merci.
Merci, Colonel.
Je ne veux pas de vos remerciements.
Je dois ma vie au Lt. Thorne,
comme beaucoup d'autres personnes
sur ce vaisseau.
Il essayait de violer une prisonnière.
On ne peut pas "violer" une machine,
Lieutenant.
- Vous buvez, Thrace ?
- Seulement à l'excès, Madame.
Seulement à l'excès ?
Vous avez appris ça du Colonel Tigh ?
Pas vraiment.
J'ai cru comprendre que vous
l'avez corrigé une fois.
En fait il...
Je l'ai fait sans vraiment réfléchir.
Ne vous excusez pas.
Certaines personnes reçoivent
exactement ce qu'elles méritent.
A ce que j'ai lu sur votre XO,
il a probablement besoin de s'en
prendre une de temps en temps ?
Je sais que vous êtes très proche d'Adama.
Oui, Madame.
Je sais que c'est un homme bon.
Et je sais qu'il a dû faire des choix
difficiles ces derniers mois.
Les Dieux savent que j'ai dû en faire.
Vous comprenez donc ce qu'il a fait
et pensait devoir faire
quand vous avez annoncé
l'exécution de Helo et Tyrol.
Laissez-moi vous dire quelque chose.
J'ai vu un paquet de gosses
mis dans des sacs mortuaires.
Couverts du drapeau
et jetés dans l'espace.
Vous pensez que je ne comprends pas
ce qu'il ressent envers ses hommes ?
Il faut parfois faire de terribles choses.
Inévitablement,
chacun d'entre nous
devra faire face au moment
où il doit commettre un horrible péché.
Et si on flanche à ce moment,
si on hésite une seule seconde,
si on laisse sa conscience s'en mêler,
vous savez ce qu'il se passe ?
Il y aura plus de gosses
dans ces sacs mortuaires.
Plus de gosses flottant dans l'espace.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi...
mais j'ai foi en vous.
Je veux que vous me promettiez
qu'au moment venu,
vous ne flancherez pas.
Ne flanchez pas.
Entrez.
Un message du Pegasus, Monsieur.
Ils te font faire le messager maintenant ?
En fait, j'ai...
J'étais volontaire pour celui-ci.
Kara m'a parlé de sa...
de sa mission.
Tu es venu me faire changer d'avis ?
Je voulais juste te l'entendre dire.
La décision a été prise.
L'assassinat.
C'est ça ta décision.
C'est comme ça que tu règles
tes différends avec tes supérieurs.
Si tu penses avoir un problème
pour couvrir Starbuck,
je peux trouver quelqu'un d'autre.
Le problème n'est pas là.
Je ne vais pas débattre de ça avec toi.
Ce fut une très dure décision.
Mais je pense que la Présidente a raison.
C'est le meilleur moyen
de protéger la flotte.
La Présidente ?
- Alors toi et la Présidente...
- Oui.
Elle est d'une autre trempe
que ce que les gens en disent.
C'est tout ce que je dois signer ?
Oui. Oui, Monsieur.
Merci, Monsieur.
Lieutenant.
Content de te revoir.
<i>Attention Pegasus.</i>
<i>Préparation du saut.</i>
<i>A tous les Pilotes, Rapport en salle
de briefing dans 5 minutes.</i>
<i>Equipes Leurre, contactez le CIC.</i>
<i>Tourelles. Configuration
pour vaisseau-mère cylon.</i>
<i>Après le saut,
visez les vaisseaux-mère cylons.</i>
On y va.
<i>A tous les escadrons Résurrection.</i>
<i>Au rapport en salle de briefing 4.</i>
<i>Préparez le vaisseau pour le saut.</i>
<i>A tout le vaisseau,
passez en condition 1.</i>
- Bonne chasse, Capitaine.
- Vous aussi, Colonel.
Désolé pour tout ça, Saul, mais
l'Amiral n'est pas vraiment à l'aise
que nos Marines soient sous tes ordres.
Oui, je suis désolé
pour beaucoup de choses.
Assure-toi que tous nos soldats
soient conscients
de leur rôle si nous sommes abordés
par les Cylons.
La dernière chose dont on a besoin,
c'est des Coloniaux s'entretuant.
Je suis bien d'accord.
Attendez dehors.
Oui, Monsieur.
Asseyez-vous.
Je vous ai fait venir pour comprendre
pourquoi les Cylons nous haïssent tant.
Je ne suis pas sûre de savoir
répondre à ça.
Haïr n'est peut-être pas le mot juste.
Je ne veux pas d'une joute verbale.
Je veux juste savoir pourquoi.
C'est ce que vous avez dit à la cérémonie
avant l'attaque,
lorsque le Galactica allait être désarmé.
Vous avez fait un discours
qui n'avait pas l'air d'être
celui que vous aviez préparé.
Vous avez dit
que l'humanité était
une création imparfaite.
Que les gens continuaient
de s'entretuer
par jalousie mesquine et par cupidité.
Que l'humanité ne s'était jamais demandée
pourquoi elle était digne de survivre.
Peut-être que vous ne le méritez pas.
Le Resurrection démarre ses moteurs FTL.
Ils se préparent à sauter.
Que personne ne regarde par le hublot,
s'il vous plait.
Starbuck, ici Apollo.
Les moteurs FTL n'existent plus.
Il est tout à vous.
<i>Reçu Apollo.
Red Wing sur voie d'attaque alpha.</i>
Monsieur, Je viens de recevoir
un signal d'urgence du Blackbird.
C'est la balise de détresse automatique.
Prévenez le Raptor de sauvetage.
Voyez s'il a eu le temps de s'éjecter.
Attention sur le Pegasus : préparez-vous
à lancer les escadrons d'attaque.
- Transmettez au Galactica.
- Oui, Madame.
<i>A l'attention du Galactica : préparez-vous
à lancer les escadrons d'attaque.</i>
<i>Starbuck, ici Pegasus.
Position Resurrection : de 12 - à 15.</i>
Gardez vos distances.
A vos postes.
<i>Combat engagé.</i>
<i>Fleece regarde en bas, j'en ai eu un.</i>
<i>Beau boulot. Un à zéro.</i>
<i>- Accroche-toi ! Feu !
- Putains de toasters !</i>
<i> Couvre-moi, j'arrive pas à l'abattre.</i>
- Monsieur Gaeta.
- Monsieur ?
Ordonnez aux batteries Alpha à Echo
de passer en salve continue.
<i>Armez les batteries secondaires.</i>
<i>Attaque à pleine puissance.
Feu à volonté.</i>
Des dizaines de milliers
de Cylons vont mourir.
Des dizaines de milliers, Gaius.
Dieu ne pardonnera pas ce péché.
Pensez-vous que Dieu nous pardonnera ?
Dieu pardonne tout.
Ne l'écoute pas.
Tu penses qu'elle peut t'aider ?
Que cette femme brisée peut t'offrir
ne serait-ce qu'une fraction
de ce dont je suis capable ?
Je sais ce que Dieu a prévu pour toi.
Je sais comment t'aider
à accomplir ta destinée.
Vous savez ce qui me manque le plus ?
Vous allez rire
quand je vais vous le dire.
Le sport.
Ne fais pas ça.
Oui, c'est ça.
J'allais au stade de Pyramide
juste avant le match.
Si je calculais bien,
je m'asseyais juste au coup de sifflet
et laissais l'énergie de la foule
passer à travers moi.
Vague après vague d'émotion.
Comme une décharge électrique.
C'est magnifique.
Et j'avais toujours deux tickets.
Pas ça.
Un pour moi,
S'il te plaît.
et un pour toi.
Apollo, ici le Galactica,
me recevez-vous ?
Apollo, ici le Galactica,
me recevez-vous ?
Pouvez-vous donner
votre position ?
<i>Apollo, ici le Galactica,
me recevez-vous ?</i>
Pouvez-vous donner
votre position ?
<i>Apollo, ici le Galactica,
me recevez-vous ?</i>
Apollo, ici Galactica,
me recevez-vous ?
Pouvez-vous donner votre position ?
<i>Apollo, ici Galactica, recevez-vous cela ?</i>
<i>Vous êtes là ?</i>
<i>Apollo, ici le Galactica,
me recevez-vous ?</i>
<i>Pouvez-vous donner votre position ?</i>
<i>Apollo, ici le Galactica,
me recevez-vous ?</i>
<i>Apollo, ici le Galactica,
recevez-vous cela ?</i>
Vous êtes là ?
Je suis désolé Kara.
Le Capitaine Thrace signale
d'importantes explosions.
Le Resurrection a été détruit.
Oui !
Ils ont réussi.
Dégagez.
<i>Il va bien.</i>
<i>Il est un peu secoué. Mais je répète,</i>
<i>Apollo va bien.</i>
Tous les Cylons restants ont sauté.
C'est fini, Monsieur.
Félicitations, Messieurs.
Je suis prête à mourir.
Envoie mon âme à Dieu.
S'il te plaît.
Si seulement t'étais là, Lee.
Et puis merde.
Je suis tellement fière de vous.
Fin de la Condition 1.
Tout le vaisseau repasse en Condition 2.
Officiers de division, présentez
un rapport de pertes et de dégâts au CIC.
Content de ne pas avoir eu besoin
de vos soldats aujourd'hui.
Oui, moi aussi.
Transmission du vaisseau amiral, Monsieur.
L'Amiral Cain est en ligne.
Passez-la-moi.
Félicitations, Commandant.
Félicitations à vous aussi, Amiral.
Une victoire importante.
Starbuck est avec vous ?
Oui.
Ici Starbuck.
J'ai pensé à ce dont nous
avions parlé précédemment.
Il ne suffit pas de survivre.
On doit mériter de survivre.
C'est tout.
Je trouve ça très judicieux, Monsieur.
Merci.
Commander, mon XO est-il près de vous ?
Oui.
<i>Oui, Madame ?</i>
Félicitations, Jack.
Merci, Madame.
C'est tout.
Oui, Madame.
On dirait que vous avez
besoin d'un verre.
Merci.
Au fait, je voulais vous dire
quelque chose.
La nuit dernière, je descendais
ce couloir quand j'ai vu...
Non !
Je ne peux pas faire ça.
Le suicide est un péché.
Mais je dois mourir.
Ce dont tu as besoin
c'est de justice.
Je connais un endroit où te cacher.
Où tu seras en sécurité.
Où je pourrai veiller sur toi.
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi feriez-vous ça ?
Parce que je t'aime.
Dites-moi, Amiral...
Vous pouvez faire une pirouette ?
Supplier ?
Va te faire foutre.
Vous n'êtes pas mon genre.
Elle est morte avec la certitude que son
vaisseau et son équipage étaient saufs,
et que sa mission avait été accomplie.
Rien ne comptait plus pour elle
que son vaisseau,
son équipage et sa mission.
En prenant le commandement du Pegasus
je jure de respecter ces valeurs,
qui faisaient d'elle un officier
héroïque et efficace.
Je ne connaissais l'Amiral Cain
que depuis peu,
aussi mon discours sera bref.
Elle faisait face.
Elle vous regardait droit dans les yeux,
sans flancher.
C'est assez inhabituel par ici.
On change d'avis.
On a peur.
Quand je pense aux épreuves qu'elle
a subies après l'attaque...
Toute seule.
Un vaisseau. Aucune aide.
Aucun espoir.
Elle n'a pas abandonné.
Elle n'a pas eu peur.
Elle n'a pas changé d'avis.
Elle a agi.
Elle a fait ce qui lui
semblait nécessaire,
et le Pegasus a survécu.
C'est peut-être difficile à admettre,
ou à entendre,
mais je pense que nous étions
plus en sécurité avec elle...
que nous ne le sommes sans.
Lee.
Lee, ça va ?
Ça va ?
Non, pas vraiment.
Je...
Je n'ai pas tenu ma promesse.
- De quoi tu parles ?
- Je t'ai laissée tomber.
Je n'étais pas là
quand tu en avais besoin.
Écoute...
Une décision aussi difficile...
Ça perturberait n'importe qui.
Tu saisis ?
Je n'avais pas besoin de toi
de toute façon.
Donc...
Sois content qu'on soit revenus
vivants, d'accord ?
C'est bien ça le problème, Kara.
Je ne voulais pas revenir vivant.
Je pensais ne jamais te revoir.
Moi non plus.
Alors...
On fait quoi maintenant ?
Comment le Cylon
a réussi à s'enfuir du Pegasus
sans se faire repérer ?
Personne ne le sait vraiment.
C'était vraiment le chaos
après l'attaque.
Remercions les Dieux que vous
n'ayez pas dû appliquer mon plan.
J'en suis très heureuse.
Oui, remercions les Dieux.
Comment vous sentez-vous ?
Je pourrais dormir une année entière.
Mais vous, cependant...
ne pouvez vous permettre ce luxe
avec vos nouvelles fonctions.
Billy.
Ça a pris du temps
de trouver un bijoutier.
Merci.
Selon la rumeur,
je ne connais pas grand chose
au protocole militaire.
Mais, je crois savoir
que quelqu'un qui commande
plus d'un vaisseau
s'appelle un amiral.
Félicitations, Amiral Adama.
Merci, Madame la Présidente.
Merci Billy.
Je n'avais pas vraiment perdu espoir,
mais j'ai arrêté de leur courir après
depuis bien longtemps.
C'était juste
pour vous montrer cela, Bill.
Ne perdez jamais espoir.
Cela vaut aussi pour vous, Laura.
D'accord.
Citoyens,
je vous présente votre nouveau
vice-président : le Docteur Gaius Baltar !
Tu es le père de mon enfant.
Et rien ne pourra le changer.
Je connais un endroit où
vous pourrez rester,
et où vous serez en sécurité.
Combien de temps me reste-t-il ?
Quelques semaines, peut-être un mois.
À moins que le cancer ne touche le cerveau.
Si ça arrive, vous...
CAPRICA-CITY
189 JOURS PLUS TÔT
J'ai bien peur que les
tests soient positifs.
La grosseur est maligne. Elle s'est
étendue bien au-delà du sein gauche.
<i>J'ai bien peur que les tests soient positifs.</i>
<i>Mme Roslin...</i>
<i>Bien sûr, une opération,
pour enlever la tumeur...</i>
Ministre Roslin ?
Oui ?
Naylin Stans de l'Alliance de l'éducation.
Vous vouliez me parler ?
Oui.
<i>Je suis désolée Mr Stans...</i>
<i>Je dois avouer que j'étais surpris
d'avoir votre message.</i>
Le Président a été surpris, lui aussi.
Depuis que notre négociateur
s'est fait matraquer,
nous avons compris que le gouvernement Adar
nous a classés dans les causes perdues.
J'étais institutrice bien avant
d'être Ministre de l'éducation,
et les causes ne sont perdues
que quand on les abandonne.
Madame la Présidente ?
Vous m'entendez ?
Faisons en sorte qu'elle
souffre le moins possible.
Dieux...

<i>Starbuck zero quatre neuf...
Patrouille en route.</i>
Galactica, bien reçu.
Zéro quatre neuf.
Bon vol.
Bon vol avec 20 putains
de minutes de retard !
T'as passé une sale nuit, Starbuck ?
<i>Tu dépasses les bornes.</i>
Contente-toi de suivre mes ordres
<i>et garde tes remarques
pour ceux que ça intéresse.</i>
<i>Kat, six sept zéro, bien reçu.</i>
Demande autorisation de
vider mes canons.
Bien reçu, Kat.
Fais-toi plaisir.
<i>- Merde !
- Dysfonctionnement des armes ! Galactica !</i>
Kat, ça va ?
Ça va, ça va !
C'était quoi ça, putain ?
<i>Ton canon a explosé.
Garde ton calme, on rentre à la maison.</i>
Galactica, ici Starbuck.
Je signale une urgence.
On a deux oiseaux touchés.
Demande un atterrissage d'urgence.
<i>Starbuck, ici le Galactica.
La piste est à vous.</i>
Pourquoi vous nous avez pas
butés dans les vestiaires ?
Ça aurait évité d'abîmer les vaisseaux.
Ses canons sont ok,
je les ai vérifiés moi-même.
Ouais ? Et bien moi je ne crois
pas aux accidents.
Chef.
Quelque chose ne va pas.
Problème de poids...
Trop léger.
J'en ai trouvé 3 de plus comme ça.
Mélangées aux cartouches normales.
La douille est défectueuse.
Elle se désagrège dans le canon,
la suivante la frappe...
"Boum", elle a eu de la chance
de ne pas perdre toute l'aile.
Une balle pourrie, c'est pas de bol.
Une autre, c'est du sabotage.
Enlevez-les toutes.
Ok, vous avez entendu le Chef.
On les dégage toutes.
Comment va la Présidente, Doc ?
Elle se meurt,
et elle le sait.
Je lui ai proposé une dose de morphine
pour atténuer la douleur, mais...
elle ne veut pas en entendre parler.
Les tests sont positifs...
<i>M. le Président... les terroristes...</i>
M. le Président, nous devrions au moins
discuter avec les manifestants
avant d'envoyer les troupes.
Ce sont des professeurs,
pas des terroristes.
Ils agissent en criminels.
Leur dernière manifestation a envoyé
2 policiers à l'hôpital.
Six se sont enchaînés
devant le hall de l'Éducation.
En ce qui me concerne,
ce sont des criminels.
Leur salaire est bas,
leurs écoles tombent en morceaux.
Les grévistes gagnent des partisans
de mois en mois, vous le savez.
Je ne comprends pas pourquoi
nous ne parlons même pas avec eux.
Un des aspects les plus intéressants
d'être président,
c'est qu'on a pas à s'expliquer...
à  qui que ce soit.
Vous avez déjà prévu une réunion
avec Stans, n'est-ce pas ?
Évidemment, seulement avec votre accord,
M. le Président.
<i>Elle n'est vraiment pas en état
de faire quoi que ce soit.</i>
Encore moins de gouverner.
Ne parlez pas de moi
comme si je n'étais pas là.
Vous aurez tout le temps
pour ça bien assez tôt.
Billy, s'il vous plaît...
Bien  sûr.
Messieurs, je vous ai faits venir
pour parler
du Cylon. Docteur Cottle, pouvez-vous...
s'il vous plaît leur dire
ce que vous me disiez ce matin ?
Je ne suis pas expert en génétique,
mais je sais lire un test sanguin.
Ce fœtus cylon
montre des anomalies
génétiques très particulières.
Je n'ai pas vu cela dans
votre rapport, Docteur.
Non...
Bien, comme l'a dit le Dr. Cottle,
il n'est pas expert,
et moi, oui...
J'ai bien regardé les tests
et je dirais qu'il n'y
avait rien de concluant.
Je n'ai pas dit concluant,
juste carrément bizarre.
D'accord.
Madame la Présidente.
Comme vous le savez, le Cylon Sharon
a une valeur tactique considérable
pour la flotte.
Vous êtes peut-être devenu trop proche
de votre sujet, Docteur.
C'est difficile. Je vais alors aller
droit au but.
Autoriser la naissance de cette chose
pourrait avoir des
conséquences terrifiantes.
Pour la sécurité de cette flotte,
je pense que la grossesse
du Cylon doit être arrétée
avant qu'il ne soit trop tard.
Mme la Présidente, je voudrais...
Je pensais que vous plus que tout autre
comprendrait, Amiral.
Madame la Présidente.
Je ne comprends pas, ça n'a pas de sens.
Un des aspects intéressants
quand on est présidente,
c'est qu'on n'a pas à s'expliquer
à qui que ce soit.
Merci messieurs,
je suis un peu fatiguée.
Messieurs.
Je ne veux pas paraître alarmiste,
mais j'ai des doutes.
Je pense que la maladie de la Présidente
interfère dans son jugement.
- Surtout quand on en arrive au sujet...
- Elle me semble suffisamment cohérente.
Mais je dois souligner
l'intérêt scientifique.
Tuer cet enfant aurait de graves conséquences
sur mes études des sous-espèces cylons.
La présidente a pris une décision,
je la soutiens.
Sauf respect, elle a pris une décision
basée sur des preuves
présentées par le Dr. Cottle...
Reprenez-vous.
Vous êtes sur le point de devenir
Président des colonies.
Vous devrez prendre
des décisions tres difficiles.
Faites comme si vous en étiez capable.
Dieux !
Où étais-tu passée ?
Où j'étais passée ?
Je ne t'ai jamais quitté, Gaius.
D'accord, oui....
métaphoriquement parlant.
Seulement ça fait des semaines
maintenant et je...
Je suis sûre que tu as énormément
souffert en mon absence.
Tu sais, la jalousie est
une émotion vraiment détestable.
Qu'est-ce que c'est que
cette polémique acharnée
sur ma liaison avec
ton double en trois dimensions ?
Je ne suis pas jalouse, je suis inquiète.
Inquiète, de quoi ?
Notre enfant !
Tu es inquiète, maintenant ?
Pour ta gouverne, la Présidente
a l'intention de le tuer.
Quand Roslin ne sera plus là,
tu seras Président.
Grâce à ta nouvelle autorité,
tu pourras sauver notre enfant.
Comme si ça allait...
Tu as vu comment Adama m'a regardé ?
Le mépris sur son visage ?
Je serai le Président, d'accord.
Mais sans l'appui des militaires,
je pourrais aussi bien être
sacré employé de fourrière.
Tu as tes propres ressources
si tu veux t'en servir.
Quoi ?
Tu ne vois pas de quoi je parle ?
Non, je ne vois pas de quoi tu parles.
L'engin nucléaire.
Celui qu'Adama t'a fourni
pour tes recherches.
Il y a un moyen.
Je ne voulais pas avoir
à vous le demander.
mais ce dont j'ai vraiment besoin
pour achever le projet...
- c'est une ogive nucléaire.
- c'est une ogive...
nucléaire.
Tu es complètement folle.
J'essaye de t'aider, espèce d'idiot.
Si Adama s'obstine à vouloir
tuer notre enfant,
c'est peut-être notre seul espoir.
Ce n'est pas facile à dire.
Il s'agit de la Cylon.
La Présidente a décidé
de mettre fin à sa grossesse.
Quoi ?
Pourquoi ?
Docteur Cottle a découvert des anomalies
dans l'hémogramme du fœtus.
Ce n'était pas prévu ?
Peut-être.
Mais  la Présidente pense
que permettre au bébé d'arriver à terme
représente un risque
inacceptable pour la flotte.
Je ne comprends pas.
Sharon n'a fait que nous aider
depuis son retour de Caprica.
- Elle a même trahi les siens.
- Pour sauver sa peau.
Ne confondez pas la volonté de vivre
avec la véritable compassion, Lieutenant.
Elle est toujours l'ennemie.
Est-ce qu'elle est au courant ?
Pas encore.
Alors c'est moi qui devrais lui dire.
- Ça sera tout, Monsieur ?
- Helo.
Je ne m'attends pas à ce que vous soyez
d'accord avec cette décision.
Mais j'ai besoin que vous l'acceptiez.
Nous parlons de mon enfant, Monsieur.
Une partie de moi.
Mais je suppose qu'il est plus facile
de le tuer en l'appelant un "Cylon".
Rompez.
Vous dites que quelqu'un
a trafiqué nos munitions ?
Les obus ne se vident pas tout seuls.
J'ai cru comprendre que
vous auriez ordonné
aux chasseurs du Galactica et
du Pegasus de quitter leur service ?
Le prix à payer pour
m'avoir rétabli CAG, Monsieur.
C'était peut-être une erreur.
- Je me fous peut-être de ce que vous pensez.
- Du calme vous deux.
Nous confrontons les versions
sur les deux vaisseaux.
Personne n'ira au combat avant
que nos munitions ne soient contrôlées.
Ce qui nous laisse sans défense si les
Cylons décident de nous attaquer.
Nous étions sans défense avant ça,
mais on ne le savait pas.
Lee, trouve qui a fait ça.
Bien.
- Pardon, je cherche Asha Janik.
- Asha ? Elle est là-bas.
Faisons ça dans le calme.
Asha Janik ?
Capitaine Adama.
J'ai un message pour votre père.
- Ils peuvent me prendre !
- Arrêtez-la.
Mais nous sommes nombreux !
Nous avons déclaré la guerre
aux armées de la mort du Galactica !
Les Cylons ne sont pas
nos véritables ennemis !
Ce sont les militaires
qui refusent de négocier !
Nous ne voulons que la paix !
Exigez  la paix !
- Exigez la paix !
- Autant pour la discrétion.
Nous avons trouvé
ces tracts dans les quartiers de Janik.
Un espèce de manifeste.
"Faites la paix avec les Cylons" ?
Mais qui sont ces gens ?
Des sympathisants des Cylons.
Je ne savais pas qu'ils
étaient si organisés.
Je veux savoir comment elle est
montée à bord de mon vaisseau.
Le hangar de pont manque de personnel.
On a dû faire venir des civils
pour les tâches courantes.
Apparemment, elle est de Picon. Elle a
travaillé à la maintenance sur le Greenleaf.
Pas d'affiliation criminelle connue.
Jusqu'à présent, écoutez-ça :
"N'ayez pas peur,
nous ne sommes pas des terroristes
"mais nous n'allons pas rester immobiles
alors que la machine de guerre d'Adama
"nous contraint
à un conflit futile et cruel."
- Putain de merde.
- Leurs manifestations font leur effet.
La nouvelle se propage déjà
dans toute la flotte.
Je sais.
Nous avons été contactés par
une personne qui prétend parler
au nom des militants et qui exige
une réunion sur le Galactica.
Ils ont des couilles, je dois l'admettre.
J'ai accepté.
Quoi ?
Nous ne négocions pas.
Je veux seulement savoir
à qui on a affaire.
<i>Vous allez bien, Madame la Ministre ?</i>
<i>Vu les enjeux, vous ne semblez
pas particulièrement engagée.</i>
Les enjeux sont ce qu'on décide
d'en faire, Monsieur Stans.
Si le Président utilise
les forces armées
pour vous obliger à retourner
travailler, il y aura des blessés.
Et même des morts.
Certaines causes valent
qu'on meure pour elles.
Pas celle-ci.
La tumeur est maligne.
Docteur.
Amiral.
Je suis Royan Jahee.
Vous avez une drôle de façon
d'accueillir les visiteurs.
Visiteurs, mon cul. Les gens comme vous,
on les descend pour trahison.
Je ne suis qu'un des protagonistes
qui essaie d'arrêter les bains de sang.
Je déplore ce qui s'est passé
à bord de vos Vipers.
Combien de vos sympathisants
sont à bord de cette flotte ?
Si vous tentez de broyer une organisation,
vous pouvez arrêter tout de suite.
Les gens de ce mouvement
suivent une idée,
- pas un chef.
- Mais qu'est-ce qu'ils veulent ?
La paix avec les Cylons.
Vous voulez qu'on se rende ?
Ils nous ont attaqués.
Seulement après qu'on les ait asservis !
Vous vous prétendez
militaires, stratèges.
Expliquez-moi comment notre tactique
actuelle d'attaque et de retraite
- mène à la victoire ?
- Vous pouvez jouer le spectateur innocent
mais je pense que vous en savez plus
que vous ne le dites.
Vous êtes un danger pour cette flotte.
Amiral, m'arrêter ne mettra
pas un terme à tout ça.
Peut-être pas,
mais c'est un début.
Emmenez-le.
Enfile tes gants en caoutchouc.
C'est tout ce qu'il y avait dans
les quartiers de cette Janik.
Je sais pas pourquoi l'Amiral
pense que fouiller ces merdes
va nous apprendre des choses
sur ce soi-disant mouvement.
Alors...
Je ne t'ai pas beaucoup vu depuis
ta balade dans l'espace.
Attends.
C'est quoi, ça ?
Qu'est-ce qu'un matelot fout
avec des plans dans son PDA ?
Le Daru Mozu.
Une raffinerie de Tylium.
Et Janik connaît bien les explosifs.
Ici le CAG.
Préparez-moi une équipe
tactique, tout de suite.
<i>Je ne comprends pas,
pourquoi font-ils ça maintenant ?</i>
Je ne sais pas.
<i>L'amiral a dit qu'ils avaient trouvé
quelque chose dans le sang du bébé.</i>
<i>La Présidente Roslin doit le considérer
dangereux pour la flotte.</i>
<i>Il doit y avoir une autre raison.</i>
Je n'ai fait que les aider
depuis que je suis arrivée ici.
<i>J'ai retenu ma colère.
J'ai essayé de leur montrer que</i>
<i>les Cylons ne sont pas tous pareils, que
nous ne sommes pas tous des assassins.</i>
Au fond,
<i>je pense qu'ils ont encore peur de toi.</i>
<i>Oui...</i>
<i>Peur ?</i>
Ils veulent avoir peur
de quelque chose ?
Oui ?
Qu'ils viennent !
Qu'ils le fassent !
Qu'ils essayent de prendre mon bébé !
Qu'ils essayent de prendre mon bébé !
Sharon, arrête !
<i>Sharon, ne fais pas ça s'il te plaît !
Je t'en prie !</i>
Écoute-moi.
Écoute-moi.
Sharon, regarde-moi.
Allons-y !
Doucement !
Une fois posés, foncez.
On cherche une bombe
située près du moteur FTL du Daru.
Capitaine, je reçois un signal radio.
Ça doit venir du Daru Mozu.
<i>Aucun de nous ne désire mourir,</i>
<i>mais les combats doivent cesser.</i>
<i>Si mon sacrifice peut envoyer un message
aux Cylons et amener la paix,</i>
<i> alors cela en valait la peine.</i>
<i>Je fais cela pour mes enfants,
et pour les enfants qu'ils auront.</i>
<i>À la grâce des Dieux.
Exigez la paix.</i>
<i>- Décrochez !
- Exigez la paix.</i>
<i>Décrochez, décrochez !</i>
- Des gens sont morts.
- Je les pleure, Amiral.
Et je vous garantis que la raffinerie
de Tylium n'est qu'un avant-goût
à moins que quelqu'un
se décide à écouter !
Écoutez-moi  et écoutez moi bien.
Je me fous d'avoir à interroger
chaque civil de cette flotte.
Cela va cesser.
Vous comprenez ?
Oui.
Monsieur, la Présidente Roslin
a insisté pour que vous visitiez.
Elle aimerait que la transition se fasse
autant que possible en douceur.
Qui sont-ils ?
Les agents cylons que l'on suspecte.
Ce chiffre est un symbole pour elle.
Il représente l'espoir,
notre futur.
Oui, oui.
Être Président, c'est...
c'est une grosse responsabilité.
C'est une tradition pour le Président sortant
de laisser une lettre à son successeur.
Habituellement, elle est ouverte
le premier jour du mandat,
mais les prochains jours risquent d'être...
pour le moins mouvementés.
Prions pour qu'elle aille mieux.
Oui, prions.
Excusez-moi.
Oui.
M. le Vice Président ?
Allô ?
Oui.
Oui.
Je comprends.
Merci.
On m'a dit que je pourrais
rencontrer une vieille amie ici.
C'est bon de te revoir, Gaius.
Tu es devenue membre
du mouvement pour la paix ?
Contrairement à ce que tu penses,
j'ai toujours détesté la violence.
Voulez-vous nous excuser ?
S'il vous plaît.
Ont-ils une idée de ce que tu es ?
Bien sûr que non,
même leur dévouement a ses limites.
Tu m'as manqué.
Tu es superbe.
Je ne peux pas croire...
à quel point tu es réelle.
Que fais-tu ?
Je n'ai cessé de penser à toi
dès l'instant où j'ai quitté le Pegasus.
- Non.
- Tu ne quittes jamais mes pensées.
Ne fais pas ça.
- Pas encore, Gaius.
- Je ne peux pas m'en empêcher.
Je suis désolé.
Je suis désolée.
Je ne suis pas encore prête.
Il y a une raison particulière
pour m'avoir fait venir ici ?
Parce que tu m'as sauvée.
Laisse-moi te sauver.
Nous y revoilà.
De quoi parles-tu ?
Tu dois le sentir.
Gaius, la flotte s'effondre.
Les gens s'attaquent entre eux.
Ils se méfient vraiment des militaires.
Quand tu seras Président,
tu pourras utiliser le gouvernement
contre Adama,
et préparer la voie pour que
les Cylons nous sauvent.
J'aimerais rester avec toi pour toujours.
Je sais que c'est dur,
mais c'est le seul moyen.
Non.
Je suis pas celui que tu crois.
Et je ne serai pas responsable
de la destruction de l'Humanité.
Si on l'avait découvert avant,
on aurait peut-être pu faire plus.
Laura, entre.
Je n'ai pas aimé la façon
dont on s'est quittés ce matin.
- Richard, je...
- Je sais.
Tu penses depuis longtemps
que c'est une erreur.
Je viens de voir Stans.
L'Alliance de l'Éducation se retire.
Se retire ?
Que leur as-tu donné ?
Je leur ai promis que nous examinerions
sérieusement leurs doléances.
Je pensais que tu te réjouirais.
Ils retournent travailler.
Tu m'as mis dans une position
très embarrassante.
Je ne vois pas en quoi.
Il y a eu compromis entre les parties.
Ce n'est pas seulement tes profs,
mais la prochaine grève
qui m'inquiète.
Tu leur a montré que s'ils tenaient
assez longtemps, ce gouvernement cèderait.
Tu t'attendais à ce que j'échoue.
J'espérais que tu les occupes.
Ce n'est pas la fin du monde,
tu pourras rester conseillère, les Dieux
savent qu'on a besoin de tes idées.
Tu me demandes de démissionner ?
Je n'ai pas le choix.
Cela n'a plus rien à voir avec toi et moi.
Tu as raison,
plus du tout.
Tu voulais attaquer ces gens,
et il y a quelques heures,
je t'aurais laissé faire.
Je pars sur le Galactica
pour représenter ce gouvernement.
A mon retour, si tu veux ma démission,
il va falloir te battre.
<i>A mon retour, si tu veux ma démission,
il va falloir te battre.</i>
Prévenez l'Amiral.
<i>Ici l'Amiral Adama.</i>
Comme vous le savez,
la Présidente
est à bord du Galactica
<i>depuis quelques jours.</i>
<i>C'est une battante.</i>
<i>Mais au moment où je vous parle,
son état est grave.</i>
Je sais que beaucoup
croient au pouvoir de la prière.
Si c'est votre cas, je vous conjure
de prier pour notre Présidente.
Quant aux autres,
j'espère que comme moi,
vous aurez une pensée pour elle.
Amiral,
s'il vous plaît, ne faites pas ça.
Baissez tous vos armes.
Écartez-vous.
Réfléchissez à ce que vous faites, Helo.
Vous êtes un soldat.
Je suis un père,
comme vous.
S'il vous plaît, Monsieur.
Donnez-moi un Raptor, elle quittera le
vaisseau. Je l'emmènerai loin de la flotte.
Je ne peux pas faire ça.
Amiral, Amiral !
Amiral !
Dégagez de là, Docteur.
Amiral,
je dois vous parler de l'enfant cylon.
Il semble que je me sois
trompé.
Vraiment trompé.
Quand je disais que le Dr. Cottle avait
mal interpreté le test sanguin.
J'ai de nouveau examiné ces échantillons
et j'ai découvert quelque chose
de plutôt intrigant.
Le sang cylon est pratiquement
indifférenciable du nôtre.
Ceci dit, il doit être légèrement différent
parce que les Cylons ne sont pas humains.
Si...
Si notre sang
ressemble à ça
par exemple.
Et le sang cylon à ceci...
Alors on peut supposer que
le Demi-Cylon possède un mélange.
C'est une théorie ou un fait ?
Le foetus cylon ne possède aucun antigène.
Il n'a pas de groupe sanguin.
C'est pour ça que le Dr. Cottle
disait que c'était très étrange.
Ce n'est pas étrange.
C'est stupéfiant.
Maintenant, sachant que les Cylons
sont plus résistants
que leur équivalent humain, je me demande
si le sang cylon ne pourrait pas être
béni, si on ose le dire,
d'une résistance accrue aux maladies ?
Donc,
j'ai appliqué
un échantillon du sang foetal
à quelques cellules cancéreuses
de la Présidente.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Rien.
C'est bien là tout l'interêt.
Le cancer a disparu
et ceci en l'espace de quelques heures.
Vous avez trouvé
un remède au cancer de la Présidente ?
Ça n'a pas été testé.
De ce fait c'est extrêmement
dangereux. Mais, oui...
C'est possible.
Si vous tuez le foetus
de Sharon maintenant,
on ne saura jamais.
Vous sentirez peut-être une brève douleur.
Sharon, tout va bien.
Tout va bien se passer.
Je n'aime pas ce que vous faites. Selon moi
c'est contre nature et sacrément dangereux.
Oui. Et bien...
vu l'état actuel de la patiente,
je n'y vois pas d'inconvénients.
Peut-être que son heure est venue.
Et pour une fois
peut-être suis-je la lueur d'espoir ici.
Ça va, tout va bien aller.
Je suis avec toi, Sharon.
Si vous voulez régler ceci,
vous devez vous retirer.
Plus de désobéissance civile,
plus d'actes de violence.
Je veux nos étudiants
de retour dans leurs écoles.
Ça marche.
Je suis content que vous ayez
appelé, Mme la Ministre.
Moi aussi.
<i>J'ai peur que
les tests soient positifs.</i>
<i>La grosseur est maligne.</i>
Il se passe quoi ?
Dégagez ! Bordel !
Elle convulse. Donnez-moi 10 ml.
Aidez-moi à la mettre sur le côté.
Infirmière !
Non, attendez.
Que je sois pendu.
Madame la Présidente ?
Docteur Baltar ?
C'est si bon de vous revoir.
Non, non... Ne bougez pas.
Mme la Présidente, très bien.
48 H PLUS TARD
Comment va-t-elle, Docteur ?
J'ai jamais rien vu de tel.
Il va lui falloir un moment
avant d'être à 100%...
Mais les scans sont clairs.
Le cancer a disparu.
Vous êtes sûr ?
Il a disparu.
Merci.
Merci.
Amiral.
Vous semblez aller mieux.
Beaucoup.
Vous détenez toujours le porte-parole
de la nouvelle faction en cellule ?
Oui.
Voulez-vous m'amener à lui,
s'il vous plaît ?
- Certainement.
- Merci.
Je vais attendre qu'on vous habille.
Présidente Roslin.
M. Yahee, c'est ça ?
J'ai pensé
qu'il était temps qu'on se voit.
Voulez-vous ouvrir la porte ?
Allez-y.
Tous ces gens veulent être entendus.
Un membre de votre groupe
a presque détruit la raffinerie de tylium.
Avant même de commencer à parler,
il me faut votre assurance
qu'il n'y aura plus d'attaques.
Comme je l'ai dit à l'Amiral,
je n'ai aucun contact...
Des négociations sincères
exigent la confiance.
Ne me mentez pas.
Je parlerai à mes hommes.
Je leur ferai comprendre.
Excellent. Et j'écouterai.
Peut-être même agirai-je.
Mais si vous vous rétractez
j'insisterai pour que l'Amiral
vous pourchasse sans merci.
Tu sembles très satisfait.
L'enfant de Sharon est sauf.
Adama et Roslin sont d'accord pour
l'étudier davantage avant
de prendre des mesures radicales.
Mais en sauvant Roslin, tu t'es refusé
la place légitime de leader.
Il y a beaucoup d'aspects en toi, Gaius,
que je ne comprendrai jamais.
En effet.
Et ton équivalent réel non plus d'ailleurs.
Est-ce que tu l'aimes ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
La lettre que Roslin m'a écrite.
À ouvrir si elle meurt.
"Président Baltar. Je vous présente
mes sincères félicitations."
Merci.
"Je le dis sachant nos différends
"et le fait que vous preniez ma place
en dépit de mes nombreuses réserves.
"Vous êtes sûrement la personne
la plus intelligente que j'ai rencontrée,
"mais votre intelligence
n'est jamais teintée de compassion.
"On doit vous rappeler
vos responsabilités morales
"et vous forcer à dépasser
vos propres besoins égoïstes.
"Je n'écris pas cela pour vous blesser,
"mais pour vous supplier
d'ouvrir votre coeur.
"Comprenez que la flotte ne cherche
pas uniquement votre autorité
"mais votre réconfort...
"Votre justice.
"Trouvez un moyen de leur donner
"et vous serez un grand dirigeant.
"Laura Roslin."
Après tout ce que j'ai fait pour la flotte.
Tout ce que j'ai fait pour elle.
Roslin ne t'a jamais fait confiance.
Elle t'a sapé à chaque décision,
et maintenant...
Maintenant on sait
qu'elle ne me fera jamais confiance.
Ce n'est plus une lutte politique, Gaius.
C'est presque littéralement
une question de vie ou de mort.
La Présidente m'a assuré que
s'il n'y a plus d'acte de violence,
elle est prête à exposer nos préoccupations
au Conseil et à l'Amiral Adama.
Elle essaye de gagner du temps.
Elle ne négociera jamais avec les Cylons.
Je ne suis pas d'accord.
Je pense que nous avons fait
de réels progrès aujourd'hui,
ainsi que le Vice-Président.
- Baltar ?
- Oui.
Juste avant de partir,
il a demandé à me voir.
Il a invité à la patience pendant
qu'il s'occupe de Roslin de l'intérieur.
Il a offert le contenu de cette valise
comme preuve de sa sincérité.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a dedans ?
Je ne sais pas.
Il a dit que tu devrais l'ouvrir.
Frack !

J'ai du retard ŗ rattraper, j'ai peur
d'avoir perdu le fil lors de ma maladie.
- J'ai laissť les choses dťraper.
- C'est du passť.
Oui, Áa l'est.
A tel point
qu'on manque de tout et
que les gens s'inquiŤtent.
Ce ne serait pas des civils
s'ils ne se plaignaient pas.
Je crois qu'ils ont le droit
dans ce cas prťcis.
Nos stocks sont un peu justes
mais pas critiques.
Or, dans toute la flotte on rapporte
un manque de produits essentiels,
qu'on ne peut se procurer qu'au prix fort.
Ils se tournent vers le marchť noir.
La semaine derniŤre, un de mes hommes
a eu une pneumonie. Billy a dŻ ťchanger
de l'alcool pour avoir des antibiotiques.
Ainsi va le monde.
Les gens exigent d'avoir ce qu'ils veulent.
Quelques ťchanges seraient une chose,
soyons rťalistes.
Mais je parle de criminels qui
profitent ainsi des gens.
C'est pourquoi, j'instaure une nouvelle
politique commerciale au sein de la flotte.
Nous devons contrŰler la chaÓne
de ravitaillement,
et non ces gangsters du marchť noir.
J'espŤre avoir l'appui des militaires
sur cette affaire.
Amiral, vous n'avez qu'un mot a dire pour
que le Pegasus pourchasse ces chiens.
Nos hommes feront tout ce qu'il faut
pour contrŰler la situation.
C'est bon de vous voir de retour,
Madame la Prťsidente.
C'est bon d'Ítre de retour.
Merci, Amiral.
Messieurs, Merci.
Est-ce que la Prťsidente
est toujours aussi directe†?
Sa rťsurrection subite doit
l'avoir fortifiťe d'une certaine faÁon.
Ouais, peut-Ítre mÍme trop.
Elle ne pense pas que toutes ses idťes
vont faire changer les choses, non†?
Comme si on avait pas assez ŗ faire.
La prťsidente impose un certain prestige
avec son gouvernement
et Adama la soutient, pour l'instant.
Alors, moi aussi, pour le moment.
Au fait, avez-vous eu les cigares
que je vous avais envoyťs†?
Oui et j'en ai aussi profitť.
Tout le plaisir est pour moi, M.
le Vice-Prťsident.
Bien, j'ai un vaisseau ŗ faire tourner.
- Au plaisir de vous revoir.
- De mÍme.
Je les ai eu par un ami.
- Paya†!
- Salut chťrie.
On dirait que tu grandis
dťs que j'ai le dos tournť.
Tu ne me sers pas la main†?
Pas grave, Paya.
J'ai une surprise pour toi.
Elle est lŗ-dedans.
Tu veux la voir†?
- Il a quoi†?
- Allez.
Qu'avons-nous lŗ†?
Paya†!
Les enfants,
Áa n'a jamais ťtť mon fort.
J'en aurai peut-Ítre une
autre avec deux yeux.
- Je pourrai peut-Ítre l'ťchanger.
- Non, Áa va.
Tu l'as juste surprise.
Bon...
…coute, je ne suis pas sŻr
de quand je pourrais revenir.
Je sais.
Je dois t'en demander 100 de plus,
vu que t'as passť la nuit.
Bien,
je me demandais quand vous viendriez.

<i>Raptor 129. Vous pouvez atterrir.</i>
Galactica, ici Raptor 129,
ŗ nous de jouer.
Vitesse d'approche 220.
Amiral, Colonel.
J'ai ŗ peine commencť, mais
il a apparemment ťtť ťtranglť.
Dieux, il ne nous manquait
plus que Áa.
Amiral,
je pense que cela va vous intťresser.
On dirait que notre ami, Fisk,
a touchť le gros lot.
Des Cubits†?
Si vous trouvez autre chose,
informez-moi immťdiatement
Si je trouve autre chose,
je prends ma prťretraite.
- Quelqu'un nous envoie un message.
- Ou nous fait tourner en bourrique.
Il y a peut-Ítre un autre Cylon
dans la flotte.
Je prťfťrerais presque Áa ŗ l'alternative.
On commence ŗ tuer les nŰtres.
Tout ce qu'ils ont ŗ faire
c'est s'asseoir et regarder.
Fisk†?
On a une idťe de qui a fait Áa†?
Non.
Mais nous allons faire une enquÍte
et je veux que tu la mŤnes.
Tu ne crois pas que Áa serait mieux
que quelqu'un du Pegasus s'en charge†?
MÍme si Cain a disparu,
son influence perdure.
J'ai besoin de quelqu'un de confiance.
Il y eut un temps oý la confiance ťtait...
une denrťe plutŰt rare entre nous.
Nous avons traversť de rudes
ťpreuves tous les deux, fils.
Et j'espŤre que nous
en sommes sortis grandis.
J'ai besoin de ton aide.
Je vais mobiliser un vol pour
le Pegasus sur le champ.
Personne d'autre n'est entrť†?
Seulement l'ťquipe mťdicale, Monsieur.
<i>Quoi†?
<i>Comment†?</i>
<i>Savez-vous qui je suis†?</i>
<i>Je suis le Vice-prťsident des colonies.
Laissez-moi entrer.</i>
Capitaine Adama.
Le Commandant Fisk ne m'a pas
dit que vous ťtiez invitť.
Laissez-le entrer.
Ils allaient me laisser entrer.
Oh, Dieux†!
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ici†?
Oý est Fisk†?
Sur une table d'autopsie
ŗ la morgue du Galactica.
Quoi, il est mort†?
Ce n'est pas votre marque†?
Attention, Gaius.
Tu t'es achetť leur bienveillance en
sauvant la vie de Roslin mais Áa disparait.
- Leurs vieux soupÁons ressurgissent.
- Que faites-vous ici†?
Capitaine.
J'allais vous poser la mÍme question.
Attendez un peu.
 tes-vous en train de m'interroger†?
Je ne suis pas sŻr
d'apprťcier votre ton.
Ce n'est pas un exercice diplomatique.
Un homme a ťtť ťgorgť.
Sa tÍte a ťtť pratiquement dťtachťe
de son corps avec une corde de piano.
Tu es le vice-prťsident de la flotte.
Pourquoi agis-tu comme un enfant
pris la main dans le sac†?
Je me demande ce qu'elle dirait
si elle te voyait comme Áa.
Je ne peux pas croire que je doive
me justifier devant vous.
…videmment, je n'ai rien ŗ voir
avec la mort du Commandant Fisk.
Je venais juste discuter de la nouvelle
politique commerciale de la Prťsidente.
Je croyais que c'ťtait rťglť.
Non, le Commandant Fisk
avait des rťserves.
Je l'aurais pariť.
Et en tant que vice-prťsident,
j'ai dťcidť d'apaiser ses doutes
de ma propre initiative.
Est-ce suffisant†?
Ou voulez-vous que je
vous fournisse un alibi†?
Je suis sŻr que je peux
en trouver un sur le champ.
Profitez bien des cigares.
Escortez le vice-prťsident
ŗ son vaisseau.
«a devient dingue ŗ la radio.
La nouvelle du meurtre de Fisk
s'est rťpandue dans toute la flotte.
Quand on perd un officier
ŗ bord d'un vaisseau de guerre,
les gens commencent ŗ s'inquiťter
de leur propre sťcuritť.
Un ťquipage peut s'effondrer
si son commandant est tuť.
Le Pegasus en a perdu deux
en quelques semaines.
Cette fois, ils ont peut-Ítre
eu de la chance.
Son journal personnel montre
qu'il a dťtournť des marchandises
chargeant et dťchargeant
des cargos sans autorisation.
Il a dťvalisť le McConnell et une douzaine
d'autres vaisseaux ces derniŤres semaines.
J'ai aussi trouvť une petite malle
pleine de marchandises
de valeur dans ses quartiers.
Il faisait du marchť noir.
La moitiť de la flotte en fait.
Fisk devenait ambitieux.
S'il a roulť un de ses
fournisseurs sur une affaire,
Áa expliquerait les Cubits
qu'a trouvť Cottle.
- On ne sait toujours pas qui l'a fait.
- Il devait avoir des partenaires.
«a ne devait pas Ítre trop dur
ŗ trouver, mÍme sur le Galactica.
Lee.
J'ai peur.
La toux de Paya continue d'empirer.
Je lui rapporterai quelque chose
de mon prochain voyage.
«a peut Ítre dans plusieurs semaines
si les Cylons attaquent de nouveau.
Je n'arrÍte pas d'entendre parler
de pťnuries sur les autres vaisseaux.
Les gens ťchangent tout ce qu'ils peuvent
contre de la nourriture ou des mťdicaments.
Vraiment†?
Tu as vu toutes les nouvelles
filles dehors†?
Lee, quand ton bťbť pleure
parce qu'il a faim,
tu ferais n'importe quoi
pour que Áa s'arrÍte.
Viens-lŗ.
Maman.
Capitaine.
Que voulez-vous†?
Votre femme est dans le coin, Colonel†?
Non, pourquoi†?
C'est ŗ elle†?
Ouais.
Elle l'a perdu il y a quelque temps.
Oý diable l'avez-vous trouvť†?
Sur le Pegasus.
Dans les quartiers
du Commandant Fisk.
Elle est brŻlante.
- Qu'ont-ils dit ŗ l'infirmerie†?
- Les antibiotiques sont rationnťs.
Ils ont dit qu'ils auraient peut-Ítre
quelque chose d'ici la fin de la semaine.
Il y a des pťnuries
dans toute la flotte.
Les gens mendient les restes.
Je ne sais comment, vous et Mme Tigh avez
des fruits frais, de l'alcool authentique.
D'accord,
Oý voulez-vous en venir†?
Vous deviez savoir qu'elle
trafiquait avec Fisk.
Je vais peut-Ítre aller lui parler.
Elle ne l'a pas donnť ŗ Fisk,
c'est moi.
Je l'ai ťchangť contre
des produits de base.
Quelques bricoles pour qu'elle tienne
le coup, une putain de grosse affaire†!
- Il n'y a rien d'illťgal ŗ cela.
- Pas encore.
Ne jouez pas au Saint avec moi.
Je n'ai rien fait de plus que la plupart
des autres personnes de ce vaisseau.
Vous y compris.
Que beaucoup de personnes aient tort
ne nous donne pas raison, Colonel.
Vous n'avez pas fait cours aujourd'hui.
Oui, j'ťtais plutŰt occupť.
D'ailleurs, je crois que tu n'as plus
besoin que je te tienne la main.
C'est ce que vous faisiez†?
Me tenir la main†?
Je disais Áa comme un compliment.
Permission de parler
ouvertement, Monsieur†?
Tu n'as besoin ni de ma permission
ni du "Monsieur".
C'est peut-Ítre Áa le problŤme.
Je ne sais plus trop quoi penser.
Donc je vais Ítre directe.
- Oý est-ce Áa nous mŤne†?
- Dee...
Ne faites pas semblant
de ne pas savoir de quoi je parle.
Vous savez le temps passť ensemble.
Les entraÓnements...
Quelque chose a changť entre nous.
Je ne suis pas sŻr de ce que
tu veux que je te dise.
Alors ne dites rien.
<i>Communication pour le Capitaine Adama.</i>
<i>Vous avez un appel prioritaire
venant du Cloud Nine.</i>
Ici le Capitaine Adama.
Shevon. Shevon, c'est moi.
Shevon†?
Oh, Dieux†!
Qu'ont-ils fait†?
Ils ont dit qu'ils savaient
pour nous deux.
Ils voulaient savoir
de quoi on discutait.
- Pourquoi Áa les intťresse†?
- Bien, prends ce dont tu as besoin.
Je vous ramŤne toi et Paya
ŗ bord du Galactica.
- Lee, attends.
- C'est le seul endroit sŻr pour vous.
Que vas-tu leur dire ŗ notre sujet†?
Je ne me fais pas d'illusions.
Je sais de quoi il en retourne.
Lee†!
Laissez-nous†!
Tu m'ťcoutes†?
Si j'entends encore parler de Fisk,
je te renverrais ta putain, morceau...
par morceau. Et ensuite je me
chargerais de la petite fille.
Je sais qui tu es.
Je sais de qui tu es le fils.
Et je m'en fous.
Dis ŗ Adama de laisser tomber.
C'est lŗ que tu as rťalisť
que tu l'aimais†?
Je le croyais.
Mais tu l'as blessťe.
Ici le Capitaine Adama.
J'ai besoin d'une ťquipe mťdicale et de
sťcuritť sur le pont L, dŤs que possible.
Vous vouliez me voir,
Mme la Prťsidente†?
Oui.
Merci d'Ítre venu, docteur.
Asseyez-vous.
Voulez-vous du thť†?
Avec plaisir.
Vous savez,
je ne suis jamais sŻre ŗ quoi
m'en tenir avec vous, Docteur.
Savez-vous pourquoi†?
Je ne vois pas pourquoi.
Je n'ai jamais eu que
le plus grand respect pour vous,
et votre cabinet.
Il me semble que vous et le Cdt. Fisk
deviez vous voir juste avant sa mort.
Comme je l'ai dťjŗ expliquť
au Capitaine Adama,
le Cdt. Fisk avait plusieurs inquiťtudes
sur votre nouvelle politique commerciale.
Que dire de plus†?
Et c'est tout†?
Gaius, elle a peur de toi.
Pourquoi...
me demandez-vous cela†?
Vous m'avez sauvť la vie.
Et j'en suis reconnaissante.
Mais je sens un certain malaise
ŗ l'idťe d'assumer la prťsidence, et
j'aimerais vous offrir une issue.
- Vous quoi†?
- Dťmissionnez.
Retournez ŗ vos recherches
scientifiques sur le Galactica.
Personne ne s'interrogera
sur vos motifs.
Prenez Áa comme une seconde chance,
comme celle que vous m'avez donnťe.
Charmant.
Docteur.
C'est une offre unique.
Je vous suggŤre de la reconsidťrer.
Vous savez, Mme la Prťsidente, je ne me suis
jamais vraiment intťressť ŗ la politique.
Je n'ai jamais briguť de
poste ťlevť au pouvoir.
Je n'ai jamais voulu
Ítre Vice-prťsident.
Du moins, pas jusqu'ŗ
cet instant prťcis.
Parce qu'actuellement,
c'est ce que je dťsire le plus.
Une dans la tÍte.
Ce n'est pas vous†?
J'ai ťtť attaquť.
Je l'ai trouvť lŗ ŗ mon rťveil.
Selon le bulletin de sťcuritť,
le Commandant Fisk a ťtť
ťtranglť avec un fil de fer.
Quoiqu'il se soit passť,
vous avez votre tueur.
Et pour Shevon et sa fille†?
Le Cloud Nine est un vaisseau ouvert.
Elles sont sans doute dťjŗ parties.
J'enverrai une ťquipe.
Conseiller Zarek.
Lee.
Je viens d'apprendre la nouvelle.
Vous allez bien†?
- Que faites-vous ici†?
- J'ai une rťunion du Quorum.
Rien d'aussi excitant que ceci.
Je vous assure.
Je sais que ces endroits sont lťgaux.
Mais tout de mÍme,
le fils du tout-puissant Adama...
Parlez-moi du marchť noir.
Pas grand chose ŗ en dire.
Il est trŤs rťpandu, inťvitable,
et selon la Prťsidente Roslin...
illťgal.
Rien d'ťtonnant donc que vous et
Fisk y soyez trempťs jusqu'au cou.
Fisk, peut-Ítre. Mais pas moi.
Je reprťsente l'Astral Queen.
Je dois faire attention
ŗ mes frťquentations.
Voici le journal de Fisk.
Selon lui,
il s'est rendu trois fois sur
l'Astral Queen ces dix derniers jours
et je doute que ce soit pour parler
de rťforme carcťrale.
Qu'attendez-vous de moi, Capitaine†?
Des noms de vaisseaux,
des contacts.
Je ne peux pas vous aider.
Pourquoi croyez-vous que
Fisk m'a approchť†?
Pour avoir un pourcentage sur le marchť
noir. Pour vous offrir sa protection.
Vous et votre pŤre Ítes
tellement aveuglťs par le passť.
Le marchť noir de Fisk
tournait dťjŗ
quand il m'a contactť.
Il savait qu'Adama
remarquerait ses navettes illťgales.
Il a donc essayť de me forcer
ŗ recevoir les livraisons ŗ sa place,
pour faire ťcran entre
le Pegasus et les chargements illťgaux.
Vous voulez dire
que vous avez refusť†?
«a m'a coŻtť cher.
Vťrifiez les journaux de la flotte.
Regardez combien de vaisseaux ont fait
escale aprŤs la derniŤre visite de Fisk.
La rťponse est aucun.
Si Fisk vous assiťgeait,
pourquoi ne pas l'avoir signalť
au Quorum†?
Roslin fait comme si le marchť noir
ťtait une espŤce d'aberration,
mais je vous croyais plus malin que Áa.
Vous vous attendiez vraiment...
ŗ ce qu'un fantasme utopique
naisse des cendres†?
J'ai entendu l'officier de la sťcuritť.
Ils vous ont donnť
le tueur de Fisk pour une raison.
Ils vous offrent une ťchappatoire.
Vous savez quelque chose,
n'est-ce pas†?
Juste des rumeurs.
Il y a un cargo...
Le Prometheus.
On dit qu'il ťchappe
ŗ tout contrŰle.
Mais si vous voulez
vraiment quelque chose,
c'est lŗ qu'il faut aller.
Les affaires sont menťes par un
ancien mercenaire qui s'appelle
Phelan.
Lee.
J'espŤre qu'elle en vaut la peine.
Paya.
Paya†!
Paya†!
Hť†! Paya†!
Tout va bien.
C'est Lee.
Tu te souviens†? Lee.
Tout ira bien.
Je te le promets.
Tiens le coup.
Je reviens bientŰt.
Vous n'allez pas le croire,
mais mon pŤre aussi ťtait dans l'Armťe.
Strict comme pas deux,
sans doute comme votre paternel.
Mais quand les Cylons ont attaquť,
son sens du devoir, de l'honneur,
Áa a servi ŗ que dalle.
Elle est morte†?
Je comprends pourquoi vous la voulez.
C'est une de mes meilleures.
Une de votres...
Une bonne call-girl
sait qu'il n'y a pas que le sexe.
Elle sait quand ťcouter.
Et quand appeler ŗ l'aide.
Lee, j'ťtais obligťe.
Ne lui en voulez pas.
Vous Ítes en vie seulement parce que je
vous ai vu ŗ travers les yeux de Shevon.
Et ce que j'ai vu m'a semblť raisonnable.
Comme Fisk.
Fisk ťtait un porc.
Il a essayť de nous forcer
ŗ renťgocier.
- Alors vous l'avez tuť.
- Non.
Je vous ai donnť le tueur.
L'arme du crime,
les empreintes.
Tout ce dont vous aviez
besoin pour clore l'affaire.
En dťpit des objections de la
Prťsidente, la flotte a besoin de nous.
Le rationnement est trop sťvŤre,
les livraisons en retard,
nous sommes la valve de
pression, nous fournissons.
Quand Shevon a eu besoin
d'antibiotiques,
elle savait oý aller.
Sans nous,
Les gens ne sauraient plus
vers qui se tourner.
La flotte se dťchirerait.
Et pour ces enfants dehors†?
Comment est-ce qu'ils...
aident la flotte†?
Tout le monde a ses besoins.
Certains veulent des cigares
ou de l'alcool.
Vous vouliez Shevon.
D'autres sont plus exigeants.
Il est difficile de maintenir le moral
quand on a tous les pieds
dans la boue.
Je ne suis pas comme
mon pŤre, Capitaine,
et vous...
n'Ítes pas comme le votre.
Je suis venu seul.
Mais le Galactica m'a suivi
sur le dradis.
Il ne leur manque qu'un prťtexte
pour se dťbarrasser de ce vaisseau.
Alors on va s'arranger.
Je veux Shevon,
la fille.
Je sors d'ici,
et vous mettez un terme ŗ tout Áa.
- Et vous vivrez tous.
- Dťsolť,
la petite a dťjŗ ťtť vendue.
On ne rembourse pas.
Dieux, non†!
- Attendez.
- Lee, ne fais pas Áa.
Allez, vas-y.
Fais-le.
Je vous ai fait une
proposition honnÍte.
Moi aussi.
Vous avez sŻrement raison
ŗ propos de tout Áa.
Vous, moi, Fisk.
Personne ne peut arrÍter cela,
et peut-Ítre que personne ne devrait.
Mais il faut des limites.
Il y a des limites qu'on ne franchit pas
et vous les avez franchies.
Vous n'allez pas tirer.
Vous n'Ítes pas comme moi.
Vous n'allez...
TrŤs bien, c'est fini.
La flotte a besoin du marchť noir.
Ce n'est pas que nous aimons Áa,
mais on ne peut l'ťviter.
Alors vous Ítes toujours sur le coup.
Pour l'instant.
Mais s'il y a d'autres meurtres,
si vous retenez
des mťdicaments indispensables,
si vous...
osez toucher un seul enfant...
Shevon.
- Non, je ne veux pas...
- Regarde.
C'est fini, tout va bien maintenant.
- Lee, laisse tomber.
- Shevon, c'est fini.
Je ne peux pas Ítre ce
que tu attends de moi.
Je nattends rien de toi.
Tu veux que je sois elle.
C'est ce dont il est question.
C'est ce dont il a toujours
ťtť question.
Non.
Il n'en a jamais ťtť question.
Allez, Lee, je connais mon boulot.
Je suis un substitut.
Pour beaucoup de choses,
des choses que les hommes
ne trouvent pas ailleurs.
Des choses qu'ils ont perdues.
Elle voulait te donner un enfant.
Mais tu as eu peur,
alors tu l'as rejetťe
et tu as fui.
Tu n'as pas arrÍtť de fuir
avant qu'il soit trop tard.
Je ne suis pas elle†!
Et Paya n'est pas et
ne sera jamais ta fille.
Le meurtre du Cdt Fisk a ťtť rťsolu,
et l'ťquipage du Pegasus semble
accepter les conclusions du Galactica.
C'est tout, Mme la Prťsidente.
Pas vraiment.
A propos de ce vaisseau, le Prometheus†?
Il me semble que c'est
le cúur du marchť noir.
Nous garderons un úil sur eux.
Garder un úil sur eux†?
Ce n'est pas vraiment ce
ŗ quoi je pensais.
Accepter qu'une
organisation criminelle
prospŤre dans la flotte,
n'est pas une option, Capitaine.
Amiral†?
J'ai donnť ŗ Lee toute autoritť
sur cette affaire.
La dťcision lui appartient.
Je soutiens votre politique commerciale
de tout mon cúur, Mme la Prťsidente.
Mais nous n'aurons jamais
de systŤme parfait.
Il y aura toujours un marchť noir.
Au moins de cette faÁon,
je connais les noms, les visages,
je sais oý ils sont, et nous allons...
... surveiller la situation.
Merci messieurs, je suis occupťe.
18, je commence ŗ transpirer lŗ. 19.
- Tu devrais transpirer.
- 20.
- Pourquoi tu fais rien†?
- On ne parle pas,
on ne triche pas, jusqu'en haut.
- 8
- Vicieux.
9.
- On recommence. Zťro.
- T'as perdu le compte.
La Prťsidente n'ťtait pas
trŤs contente aujourd'hui.
Non.
Depuis que tu t'es ťjectť du BlackBird,
tu es diffťrent.
Plus dur ŗ atteindre.
J'essaie seulement de comprendre.
Comme tu l'as dit,
on a tous vťcu pas mal de choses.
C'est juste.
Mais tu aurais du me parler
de cette femme.
Je rêve...
T'es vivant ?
C'est sûrement un Cylon à part entière.
Il est peut-être plus animal
que les modèles humains.
Peut-être l'ont-ils génétiquement créé
pour accomplir une tâche.
Être un chasseur.
La ferme !
Dégage de là tout de suite.
Je la supporte plus.
Allez, je vais y arriver !
C'est quoi ce bordel ?
Kat a apponté une centaine de fois.
C'est quoi ?
Des stimulants.
Et apparemment elle les prend par poignées.
J'étais fracassée.
J'ai commencé à prendre
des stimulants, tellement stupide.
Dès que je reviens sur le Galactica,
j'envoie une équipe de secours.
Ouais, c'est ça.
Quand je dis que je vais faire
quelque chose, je le fais.
Compte là-dessus.
Mon type de femme.
Le camp de la résistance est ici.
300 clicks au nord de la seule
base aérienne cylon de la zone.
Je respecte ce que vous essayez
de faire, cependant...
Nous avons un devoir envers
les gens que nous avons laissés.
Nous le comprenons.
Il faut qu'on trouve un moyen
de revenir sur Caprica
- et aller les chercher.
- Kara !
VAISSEAU MINIER MAJAHUAL
29 ÈME JOUR D'OPÉRATION
<i>On entre dans le secteur 2-5-9.
Garde les yeux ouverts, Kat.</i>
<i>C'est là où BB et Jo-Jo l'ont payé cher.</i>
Sors de là Scar, sale Cylon
fils de pute. Viens jouer !
<i>Je crois pas qu'il réponde, Kat.</i>
Il préfère les surprises.
<i>Et bien il sera surpris quand
je lui exploserai la tête.</i>
<i>Ça sera un grand jour !</i>
Cassie.
Cassie, c'était pas ça son nom ?
<i>Le nom de qui ?</i>
La copine de Reilly.
<i>Kat, putain j'en ai aucune idée
alors lâche l'affaire, Ok ?</i>
94 HEURES PLUS TÔT.
Reilly est mort pour
une raison très simple.
Il ne pouvait pas contrôler sa peur.
Cet idiot a décroché et a fui.
Il a donné au toasteur
une belle occasion de le griller.
Scar lui a foutu la trouille.
Il a vu lœil rouge de cet enfoiré
foncer sur lui et il a paniqué.
Reilly était un bon pilote.
Il manquait de tripes,
mais il pilotait bien.
Beano en avait beaucoup.
Ça a pris une heure à Cally
pour nettoyer son cockpit.
Personne se souvient du nom
de la copine de Reilly ?
Non.
Karen, je crois.
Morte sur Picon. Karen ?
Non, c'était Kather... Kathy ?
Qu'est-ce que ça peut faire ?
On va faire un petit cercle de prière ?
Pleurer un bon coup et tout ça ?
C'est important, oui.
- Salut !
- Salut !
C'est l'Enseigne Baxton.
Enseigne Clark.
Et j'imagine qu'on est
vos nouveaux compagnons de cabine.
Bienvenue.
On vient juste de finir l'entraînement
sur Viper à bord du Pegasus.
Prêts à botter du cul de Cylon.
- Comme Beano.
- C'est qui Beano ?
Scar va vous fumer comme
un bon vieux cigare, les gars.
C'est qui Scar ?
Pas qui... Quoi.
L'as des as des toasteurs. Le Raider
le plus meurtrier de la flotte cylon.
Tu déconnes, c'est des machines,
ils sont tous pareils.
C'est ce qu'on croyait jusqu'à ce que le
Cpt. Thrace ne sorte le cerveau d'un d'eux.
Scar est le meilleur qu'ils ont.
Pas mal de pilotes sont morts
en chassant cet enfoiré.
Pourquoi ils l'appellent Scar ?
Tu verras bientôt, il a une préférence
pour les bleus. Cibles faciles.
<i>Attends Starbuck, je crois avoir quelque
chose en bas du gros rocher. Tu l'as vu ?</i>
<i>Négatif.</i>
A une époque tu l'aurais vu avant moi.
D'accord, c'est toi le tireur.
<i>- Essaie de suivre !
- Ne foire pas.</i>
88 HEURES PLUS TÔT.
Comment Scar a pu abattre un pilote
expérimenté comme Beano ?
- Il se cache...
- Il se cache derrière un astéroïde
ou un champ de débris
que tu as ignoré
parce que ça ressemblait
à un tas de rochers inoffensifs.
Tu vois, Scar n'aime pas se battre
tant que les chances
ne sont pas de son côté.
Et soudain, sortant de nulle part...
Il surgit et t'explose complètement.
Et saute avant que tu puisses riposter.
A mon avis, Scar est un lâche.
C'est pas un duel au pistolet à l'aube,
c'est la guerre.
T'as pas envie de te battre à la loyale.
Tu veux te faufiler
derrière ton ennemi,
et lui balancer un coup dans la tête.
Tu vois, Scar...
comprends cela.
Et moi aussi.
C'est pour ça que je vais le tuer.
Toi ?
Starbuck, tu peux à peine marcher.
C'est la junky aux stimulants
qui parle ?
Tu sais,
je traiterais personne de junky
si j'étais toi Starbuck.
Surtout vu ta descente
de picole dernièrement.
Un Tigh sur ce vaisseau
c'est déjà de trop.
J'ai...
J'ai 200 ici
qui disent que je plomberai le cul chromé
de Scar et quand je l'aurai fait
tu me tendras cette chope du meilleur pilote
et tu me verseras mon premier verre.
Tes lèvres toucheront jamais
le bord, petite fille.
On verra.
Allez, Starbuck !
Tu devrais peut-être ralentir.
Peut-être.
Peut-être pas.
En approche !
Voyants Ok.
Vitesse 250 !
Oh oui ! Ça doit être Scar...
<i>J'ai trouvé ta planque,
petit enculé.</i>
Starbuck, dis au revoir à tes 200.

Il est à moi.
Quelque chose ne colle pas.
Ça ne peut pas être Scar.
Il devrait sauter...
Se retourner pour nous tirer dessus.
Je surveille nos arrières.
Frack !
Frack, je suis touchée !
Ici Starbuck, je suis touchée !
Beano a ouvert le feu trop tôt.
Les gars,
ce connard doit remplir votre champ
de vision ou vous le toucherez jamais.
81 HEURES PLUS TÔT.
Vous voyez ?
Il n'est pas assez proche.
Beano est déjà mort,
mais il le sait pas encore.
Quelqu'un voit où il a merdé ?
Vous voyez ce reflet ?
Là.
C'est un Raider.
Si Beano avait pas été obsédé
par sa cible, il l'aurait vu.
C'était Scar ?
Le voilà, les enfants.
Voilà le fils de pute que je vais tuer.
Je crains d'avoir encore une fois
de bonnes et de mauvaises nouvelles.
Les mauvaises d'abord.
Le vaisseau mineur a cassé
un autre trépan.
Nous devons encore prolonger
de 8 jours.
8 jours de plus... Putain de merde.
Ils ont découvert
un filon de minerai très riche.
Assez pour construire deux escadrons
de Vipers. Je ne peux pas ignorer cela.
Quelle est la bonne nouvelle ?
Le Pegasus vient de livrer
son premier Viper opérationnel.
Nous commençons à
remplacer nos pertes.
Ils vont pouvoir remplacer
les pilotes aussi ?
<i>Récapitulons la situation tactique.</i>
Il y a 4 semaines, nos vaisseaux mineurs
ont trouvé des filons sur cet astéroïde.
Des métaux stratégiques nécessaires
à la construction de nouveaux vaisseaux.
Comme nous faisons une proie facile
jusqu'à la fin de l'extraction,
le commandant a mis la flotte hors de danger
sous la protection du Pegasus.
Notre travail est de rester ici
pour protéger les mineurs.
Malheureusement, ce système solaire
est plein de poussières et de rochers.
Le dradis ne peut pas distinguer
les rochers des méchants.
Le seul moyen de détection fiable c'est...
Nos yeux.
Ce qui veut dire
qu'on doit aller regarder partout.
Se séparer, couvrir
une grande superficie.
Nous patrouillerons la zone
par groupe de quatre
aux points stratégiques.
Deux. On y va
par groupe de deux.
Tu planifies à ma place, maintenant ?
Le CAG veut qu'on se disperse
pour contrôler une zone plus large.
C'est écrit dans les rapports.
D'accord, alors on y va par deux.
Scar et ses potes sont là-bas.
A la recherche de proies faciles.
Ne lui en donnons pas.
<i>Cette opération est vitale</i>
pour la survie de la flotte
à long terme.
Oui, en effet.
Et nous continuerons à la soutenir.
Ils nous réduisent en
poussière, Viper après Viper.
Pourquoi ne viennent-ils plus en masse ?
Est-ce dû à la destruction
du vaisseau de résurrection ?
Starbuck y travaille.
Ce Scar a sûrement dû
ressusciter une douzaine de fois.
Tu l'as peut-être déjà affronté.
Alors les Raiders se réincarnent
comme toi ?
Ouais, comme moi.
Super.
Quel putain de monde.
Un Raider est comme un animal dressé
doté d'une conscience primaire
et d'un instinct de survie.
Mais à cause de la destruction
du vaisseau de résurrection...
Quand ils meurent,
ils sont vraiment morts.
Ils ne vont donc pas attaquer en masse
au risque de subir de lourdes pertes.
Les Raiders se réincarnent ?
Logique, non ?
Vous mettez des mois
pour former un vrai pilote.
Et ils se font tuer alors leurs expériences,
leurs connaissances, leurs talents
sont perdus à jamais.
Si vous pouviez les faire revenir
dans un nouveau corps,
vous ne le feriez pas ?
La mort elle-même devient
une expérience.
Combien...
Combien de pilotes a-t-on perdu ?
Je veux dire, avez-vous perdu ?
Tu sais, il y a...
des fois je te regarde
et j'oublie ce que tu es.
Tout ce que je vois c'est
cette gamine
qui négligeait
ses appontages jour après jour.
Cette gamine qui baisait le Chef et qui
pensait que ça serait en toute impunité.
Ouais, je m'en rappelle.
Tu étais comme une grande sœur.
Kara...
Fais attention à Scar, d'accord ?
- Il est plein de rage.
- Pourquoi ?
Mourir est une expérience
douloureuse et traumatisante.
Chaque fois qu'il renaît,
ses souvenirs sont encore plus amers.
Scar te déteste
autant que tu le détestes.
Un Raider est
un salopard très agile.
Vous ne pourrez pas le garder
en mire plus de deux secondes.
Vous devez donc tirer et le tuer
durant cet intervalle,
ou il se retournera
et vous clouera.
Tous ces changements de direction
vous donnent un foutu vertige.
C'est ce que ce siège simule.
- Ok, Jo-jo.
- Allez !
- Allez, Jo-jo...
- Vas-y !
Tiens bon !
Feu !
Terminé !
Pas mal, au moins
t'as atteint la cible.
Ouais, c'est bien mieux que ma première
fois, j'avais dû descendre l'horloge par là.
Quel est le record absolu ?
Quatre tirs dans le mille.
Tu plaisantes ?
Qui a fait ça ?
Moi.
Ça te dérange pas que j'essaie
en souvenir du bon temps ?
Je t'en prie.
Ouais !
Allez Kat, maintenant.
- Deux secondes.
- Allez Kat !
Terminé !
- Cinq.
- Oui !
Merde ! Je suis touchée !
Scar m'a eue !
Je suis touchée. Je suis touchée !
Kat, ici Starbuck.
T'es où, putain ?
Starbuck,
je ne t'ai plus en visuel.
<i>Starbuck, quelle est ta position ?</i>
Les pompes primaires
et secondaires sont touchées.
<i>Je peux me charger de lui.</i>
Starbuck, je ne te vois pas.
Où t'es ?
Laisse tomber, Kat.
Scar est à moi.
<i>Sois pas idiote, Starbuck.
Quelle est ta position ?</i>
Tu te souviens de moi, hein ?
Tu veux tellement mon cul que
tu peux le sentir. Alors viens.
Parce que, putain, je te garantis
que je vais te dégommer cette fois,
pour de bon.
42 HEURES PLUS TÔT.
Un de plus.
Allez Starbuck, pousse.
Soulève-la.
Pourquoi tu pousses autant ?
Kat n'est qu'une gamine
qui sort pour se la jouer.
Comme toi
avant de rencontrer Anders.
Tu penses à lui des fois ?
A quoi bon ?
Il est mort.
Kara...
Si tu pensais
qu'il ne survivrait pas,
pourquoi tu lui as promis
de revenir avec des secours ?
Je croyais que je...
Je sais plus
ce que je croyais.
Capitaine Thrace.
Si Scar nous saute dessus...
Ouvre l'œil pour que ça n'arrive pas.
D'accord.
Mais si je merde et
qu'il me surprend... Je fais quoi ?
Quand même !
Ils ont dû te répéter ça sans arrêt
pendant la formation de base.
Je sais, Mme, mais Scar est...
Scar n'est pas différent
des autres assaillants.
il vient sur toi, tu te retournes,
tu te rapproches, tu tires.
Se retourner, se rapprocher, tirer.
Merci Mme.
Ne fuis pas ou tu mourras.
T'attends quoi ?
Rien, Mme.
Viens ici.
Viens ici, je veux te parler.
Écoute-moi bien, tu voles avec Duck
aujourd'hui. Baxton, c'est ça ?
Oui, indicatif " BB ", Madame.
Bien, c'est un
de nos meilleurs pilotes.
Fais ce qu'il te dit,
et tout ira bien.
Ne laisse pas les Raiders
s'approcher des mineurs.
- Ok.
- Bien.
Merci Mme.
Va les cueillir, mon beau.
Starbuck.
Ce gamin a besoin de
plus qu'un coup de pied au cul
et des généralités
sur la tactique, Ok ?
Tu veux être sa nounou,
te gêne pas pour moi, d'accord ?
D'après l'uniforme,
c'est un pilote de Viper qualifié.
Donc, soit je le fais voler, soit je le
laisse au sol, et on manque d'hommes.
On fait quoi ?
A toi de décider, Kat.
<i>Galactica, ici Starbuck.
Retour à la base.</i>
Reçu Starbuck.
<i>BB, ici Duck. 4 Raiders par l'arrière
du rocher, à 10 heures.</i>
<i>Ils foncent sur nous, on dirait Scar.</i>
<i>Duck, ici BB. On fait quoi ?</i>
<i>On manque de carburant
pour s'en occuper.</i>
<i>On se tire, BB.
On les laisse aux renforts. On rentre.</i>
<i>Négatif ! Starbuck a dit de répondre
à toute attaque. Armes parées.</i>
T'es à court de carburant.
Attaque pas idiot.
<i>Bordel de Dieux, BB.
C'est l'exception.</i>
<i>Arrête et
remets-toi en formation.</i>
<i>Duck, ici Starbuck. Position ?</i>
<i>4-2 Alpha, derrière le gros rocher.
On a besoin d'aide immédiatement, putain !</i>
T'es seul, Duck.
Tout le monde est trop loin.
<i>Duck, j'y serai dans 6 minutes.</i>
<i>- Duck, ici Kat. Je suis à 8 minutes.
- Duck, ils sont à mes six heures.</i>
<i>Bons Dieux.</i>
C'est rien, Jo-Jo.
Vérifiez la pression des PC2, valves fermées,
oxygène, générateur et alim coupés.
Vérifié. Arrêt complet.
Vous ne pouviez rien faire, Capitaine.
Vous étiez trop loin.
Bien joué, Starbuck.
Il est arrivé quoi à BB ?
Ce qu'il lui est arrivé ?
Il a fait exactement
ce que vous lui avez dit, Capitaine.
Lui et Duck n'avaient
plus de carburant et rentraient
mais au lieu de ça, ce crétin
s'est retourné pour attaquer.
Scar l'a allumé
comme un feu d'artifices.
Pourquoi il a essayé
d'attaquer Scar tout seul ?
Pauvre con.
"Ne fuis pas ou tu mourras."
Je t'ai entendue enfoncer ça
dans le crâne de ce crétin.
Tu sais quoi ?
Toi et moi,
on sait que 99% du temps
c'est la bonne décision.
Pas cette fois-ci.
Tu sais ce qui m'embête ?
Je sais que dans deux semaines,
je me souviendrai plus de son visage.
Je ne me souviens d'aucun visage
une fois qu'ils sont morts.
Quoi que je fasse,
ils s'effacent.
Je me souviens même pas
de leurs noms.
Leurs noms...
Voyons voir. Il y avait...
Il y avait Flattop.
Qui s'est ramassé
à son millième atterrissage.
Il y avait Chuckles.
Arrête, tu veux ?
- Arrête. C'est pas marrant.
- D'accord.
- C'est pas marrant.
- Si, c'est marrant.
La Présidente
dit qu'on sauve l'humanité pour
un merveilleux
et brillant futur.
Sur la Terre.
Que toi et moi,
on ne verra jamais.
Et non.
Parce qu'on sort
encore,
et encore
et toujours...
Jusqu'au jour où
une saloperie métallique
nous prendra au dépourvu
et nous explosera.
Le futur brillant et merveilleux,
c'est surfait de toute façon.
C'est pour ça...
qu'on doit profiter au maximum
de l'instant présent.
Je bois à ça.
A l'instant présent.
Alors pourquoi on ne le fait pas ?
Pourquoi on ne fait pas quoi ?
- Attends un peu.
- Quoi ?
Ralentis !
C'est pas une course. Kara,
qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
Qu'est-ce qui va pas chez toi ?
Ok, tu sais quoi ?
Je ne veux pas le savoir.
Et nous ?
Il n'y a pas de nous, d'accord ?
Je voulais juste un bon coup.
Il n'y a rien entre nous.
- Tu saisis ? Rien.
- Bien sûr.
Oh Dieux.
C'est super.
La baise ou la guerre. Ok,
je suis peut-être juste un coup.
Mais, Kara, je suis aussi ton ami.
Je m'accroche à un homme mort, Ok ?
Et ça me fait chier.
Je ne sais pas ce que je fais.
Anders, c'est ça ?
Sur Caprica, le résistant.
Samuel est mort.
Qu'est-ce que ça peut faire ?
- Kara, je t'en prie !
- Je ne veux pas de ta pitié !
Je ne t'offre pas ma pitié !
Écoute, tu es très bien !
Tu es très bien avec les morts.
C'est les vivants
que tu ne sais pas gérer.
Te voilà. Je t'ai en visuel, Starbuck.
Je suis à 15 secondes de toi.
Maintenant !
On va voir si tu fais le malin
quand tu peux pas te transférer, connard !
Comment tu te sens, bâtard ?
L'un de nous va devoir décrocher
et ça sera pas moi !
<i>Starbuck, réveille-toi !</i>
<i>C'est une machine, il décrochera pas !</i>
<i>Tu cours au suicide, Starbuck !</i>
3 HEURES PLUS TÔT.
Dans un combat à deux contre deux,
les Raiders cylons aiment
isoler chaque Viper,
ensuite ils s'accrochent à un,
en espérant le descendre avant que
son équipier ne puisse le protéger.
Capitaine.
C'est ce qui vient d'arriver
à Jo-Jo il y a 20 minutes.
Frack.
C'était Scar ?
Ce salaud a fumé Jo-Jo et
a sauté en moins de 15 secondes
avant que son équipier ait pu tirer.
Et t'étais où ?
Pardon ?
D'après le planning, tu devais mener
la patrouille de Jo-Jo. Alors...
pourquoi avoir affecté
Snake à ta place ?
C'était trop tôt pour toi, Starbuck ?
Qu'est-ce que vous essayez
de dire exactement, Lieutenant ?
Ce que j'essaie de dire, Capitaine,
c'est peut-être que si vous n'aviez pas
bu toute la nuit, Jo-Jo serait encore ici.
Laissez-nous.
C'est quoi ton problème, Katraine ?
Depuis que je suis revenue,
tu es sur mon dos comme de l'urticaire.
Arriver en retard à un briefing à cause
d'une gueule de bois, c'est déjà limite.
Mais se dispenser d'une mission ?
J'ai mis Snake à ma place parce que
je n'étais pas en état de voler.
Et je le savais.
Contrairement à toi, je ne me bourre pas
de pilules pour monter dans mon cockpit
tellement shootée que je ne peux pas
faire atterrir mon putain de vaisseau.
Starbuck,
t'es une source d'ennuis.
T'étais le meilleur pilote de la flotte.
Maintenant,
tu n'es qu'une ivrogne irresponsable
qui envoie les autres se faire tuer.
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Tu vas me frapper, Starbuck ?
- Ça te fait peur, hein ?
- En fait, non.
Tu as peur la plupart du temps, Kat.
Tu as peur de finir comme cette photo
de la petite amie de Reilly.
Une petite,
photo oubliée dont personne
ne se souvient vraiment.
C'est pour ça que t'es tout le temps
sur mon dos.
Pour que personne ne voie
à quel point Scar
te fout vraiment la trouille.
Garde à vous !
Qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
Une petite discussion tactique,
Monsieur.
Ça avait l'air animé.
Bon, je vous mets ensemble.
Kat, je veux que tu voles avec Starbuck
vers le gros rocher.
Monsieur, je...
Je sens que des Raiders vont essayer
de se faufiler dans ce secteur.
Je veux donc que mes meilleurs éléments
soient dehors pour les accueillir.
Décollage dans 49 minutes.
Monsieur.
Starbuck.
Tu vas bien ?
VAISSEAU COLONIAL MINIER MAJAHUAL
29e JOUR DES OPERATIONS
<i>On entre dans le secteur 2-5-9.
Garde les yeux ouverts, Kat.</i>
<i>C'est là où BB et Jo-Jo l'ont payé cher.</i>
Cassie, c'était peut-être ça son nom.
Kat, putain j'en ai aucune idée
alors lâche l'affaire, Ok ?
Attends Starbuck. T'as vu ça ?
Oh oui ! Ça doit être Scar.
Quelque chose ne colle pas.
Ça ne peut pas être Scar.
Frack !
Je suis touchée, Scar m'a eue.
Je suis touchée !
Sois pas stupide, Starbuck,
quelle est ta position ?
Tu te rappelles de moi
maintenant, hein ?
Te voilà. Je t'ai en visuel, Starbuck.
Je suis à 15 secondes de toi.
On va voir si tu fais le malin
quand tu peux pas te transférer, connard !
Comment tu te sens, bâtard ?
L'un de nous va devoir décrocher
et ça sera pas moi !
Starbuck, j'arrive par tribord,
entre 7 et 10 heures.
Starbuck, réveille-toi !
<i>C'est une machine, il décrochera pas !</i>
<i>C'est une machine, il décrochera pas !</i>
Je n'ai rien à perdre.
<i>Tu cours au suicide, Starbuck !</i>
Je vais revenir.
Je te l'ai dit.
Je le pensais vraiment.
D'accord.
Bordel de merde !
Je vais l'amener juste en face de toi.
Le loupe pas, saloperie de junky !
Et c'est comme ça qu'on fait !
On rentre à la maison, Capitaine.
Starbuck !
Starbuck !
Ma coupe est vide.
Je me rappelle de quelqu'un se vantant que
mes lèvres ne toucheraient jamais ce bord.
Tu l'as mérité.
A BB.
Jo-Jo.
Reilly.
Beano.
Dipper.
Flattop.
Chuckles.
Jolly.
Crashdown.
Sheppard.
Dash.
Flyboy.
Stepchild.
Puppet.
Fireball.
A tous ceux là.
Ainsi soit-il.
Ainsi soit-il.
Ainsi soit-il....
J'aurais pu le faire, tu sais.
J'aurais pu abattre Scar.
Foncer dessus, droit sur lui.
J'avais juste besoin d'être
un peu plus près.
Alors pourquoi tu ne l'as pas fait ?
Je serais sans doute morte au passage.
Ce bâtard était trop doué.
Il y a quelques mois,
je n'aurais jamais pensé à ça.
J'y serais allée pour la gloire en espérant
m'en tirer d'une manière ou l'autre.
Arrête de t'apitoyer.
Tu as pris la bonne décision
en appelant ton équipier.
D'accord ? Scar est mort.
Toi et Kat êtes revenues vivantes.
C'est pas pour ça que je l'ai fait.
J'arrive pas à me sortir Anders de la tête.
Je peux pas m'empêcher d'avoir cet
espoir qu'il est peut-être vivant.
Tu as une raison de vivre maintenant.
Et non de mourir.
Il a eu son compte.
Bonjour...
On est... On est perdus.
On essaie d'aller au poste
de commandement. Pourriez-vous...
On ne parle pas...
On ne triche pas.
- Profiteur...
- Huit.
Neuf.
On recommence. Zéro...
Je vous ai fait venir pour découvrir
pourquoi les Cylons nous haďssent autant.
C'est ce que vous
avez dit ŕ la cérémonie.
Que l'Humanité était
une création imparfaite
et que les gens continuent
ŕ se tuer les uns les autres,
par jalousie, par cupidité.
Que l'Humanité ne s'était jamais demandé
pourquoi elle méritait de survivre.
Peut-ętre ne le mérite-t-elle pas.
Agent dormant infiltré...
- dans la flotte.
- <i>MODE OPERATOIRE CYLON</i>
Conquęte par la force brute.
Fécondation d'un Cylon et...
Reproduction.
Modčles multiples.
Attentats suicides.
Attaques sur...
des ressources naturelles.
<i>... UNE TUEUSE.</i>
<i>La rumeur persiste que le Galactica
abrite un agent Cylon.</i>
<i>Des témoins disent avoir vu un Cylon
aller et venir d'une cellule du Galactica.</i>
<i>L'Amiral Adama n'a fait
aucun commentaire sur cette affaire.</i>
<i>Nous continuerons...</i>
Comment la presse l'a appris ?
Ça m'étonne que ça n'arrive
que maintenant.
Il paraît que vous et des membres de
l'équipage la voyez souvent.
Elle constitue un avantage militaire
et nous fournit des informations
stratégiques vitales.
Prions pour qu'elle ne complote pas
avec d'autres Cylons.
Si j'estimais une seule seconde
qu'elle représente un danger
pour la flotte,
je la descendrais moi-męme.
Je crois que la flotte
a besoin d'entendre ça, Amiral.
Et surtout, d'y croire.
Vous avez pris des vitamines ce matin ?
- Je sais pas ce qui m'a pris.
- Non, vous avez raison.
Garder Sharon Valerii vivante,
la laisser continuer sa grossesse...
Il n'y a aucune méthode dans
tout ça. Quelqu'un...
- doit poser les questions difficiles.
- Je suis d'accord.
Je veux garder les devants.
Reconnaître l'existence de la Cylon
et faire un procčs
pour la garder sur le Galactica.
- Ça ne marchera pas.
- Quoi ? Pourquoi ?
Il faut faire confiance au peuple.
Servez-vous de la presse, dites la vérité.
On ne sait presque rien sur les Cylons.
Et avant d'en savoir plus, on ne va pas
détruire notre unique source d'informations.
- Un point c'est tout.
- Un point c'est tout, aussi simple que ça ?
Eh bien...
Puis-je avoir une minute ?
Bien sűr, c'est important ?
Vous parliez de questions difficiles...
C'est juste ma bague du groupe de débat,
mais je n'ai pas pu trouver mieux...
Je n'avais vraiment pas
prévu ça comme ça.
Enfin bref...
- Billy...
- Je t'aime.
Je t'aime depuis notre premičre rencontre.
Bon, t'étais ŕ moitié nue, d'accord.
Je sais que ça doit te surprendre.
Tu n'es pas obligée de
me répondre demain.
On peut prendre notre temps.
Billy, je ne t'épouserai pas.
Je ne sais pas comment le dire autrement.
Je suis désolée.
Il a sorti cette bague,
c'était comme un choc électrique.
Je n'arrivais plus ŕ parler.
Peut-ętre que tu regrettes
de ne pas avoir dit oui.
Non.
Je sais pas ce qu'on deviendra
Billy et moi mais...
Je sais que ne l'épouserai pas.
D'ailleurs, je sais pas non plus
ce qu'on deviendra toi et moi.
Excusez-moi.

Ellen.
Content de vous voir.
Contente de vous voir,
Capitaine.
Dee.
- Billy...
- Je savais pas que tu venais ici.
J'ai  un congé de deux jours.
Je m'accorde un peu de repos.
Je suis ici pour affaires,
comme d'habitude.
Capitaine Adama...
- Je suis vraiment trop bęte.
- Non, Billy...
Arręte.
Pas la peine.
- Tu nous laisses une minute ?
- Vous savez quoi ?
Asseyez-vous, Capitaine.
Je  vous en prie.
Billy, je suis désolé.
Je pensais qu'au moins
nous étions honnętes
l'un envers l'autre.
Tu savais que vous seriez
ensemble aujourd'hui
et tu m'as laissé
te demander en mariage.
Je sais que te donner cette bague
était stupide. D'accord.
Et peut-ętre que ça n'aurait pas
marché entre nous. Mais ça...
Tu aurais dű m'en parler.
C'est difficile, vous savez ?
De choisir de qui on va tomber amoureux.
De n'aimer qu'une seule
personne ŕ la fois.
Les gens comme nous
sont plus compliqués.
Nous ?
Je suis désolée.
Je suis venu avec des amis.
Ellen, vous ętes une habituée ici,
n'est-ce pas ?
Vous avez déjŕ vu cette femme avant ?
Dans le coin ?
Non, seulement quand je suis arrivée
et je me demandais quand ils allaient
imposer un code vestimentaire.
Ellen, les toilettes sont par lŕ.
Ętes-vous sérieux ?
Allons-y.
Lee Adama, pas possible !
C'est le moment.
Tu es pręte ?
Oui.
On est avec toi.
Vas-y.
Tout le monde vers le bar.
Maintenant ! Allez !
Toi, toi ! Contre le bar.
- Oh, Dieux !
- Trois hommes, une femme, tous armés.
Est-ce vrai que la flotte sait
que je suis sur le Galactica ?
Je m'intéresse
aux faiblesses de navigation.
Trous de ver,
tâches de matičre noire,
les embuscades probables.
J'éviterais ces pulsars ŕ cause
des interférences sur le Dradis.
Si je devais organiser
une embuscade, je la ferais lŕ.
Ça dépend, Amiral.
Ils s'adaptent ŕ chacun
de vos mouvements.
Chaque mouvement
provoque une réaction.
S'adapter.
Vous ętes bons ŕ ça, non ?
Pourquoi vous ne répondez pas
ŕ ma question ?
La flotte sait-elle que je suis
ŕ bord du Galactica ?
C'est le bébé, elle donne des coups.
La flotte est au courant.
Ça sera tout pour aujourd'hui.
Gardes.
Tu sais, si les gens savaient
ŕ quel point tu comptes sur la soi-disant
intelligence de cette chose,
ils en auraient une peur bleue.
Et toi, Saul ?
As-tu peur d'elle ?
Tu sais, la vérité c'est que...
je n'aime pas la façon dont
elle s'insinue en toi.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Le sas pressurisé peut résister
ŕ une décompression explosive.
Le seul moyen pour que
les secours puissent entrer
est d'utiliser une grosse
quantité d'explosifs.
Ou bien on peut laisser ces clowns ouvrir
la porte pressurisée pour nous.
Une équipe d'intervention
arrivera sűrement bientôt.
Ouvrir la porte pour nous ?
Pourquoi ils feraient ça ?
Donnez-moi votre verre.
- Laissez-moi leur parler.
- La glace, j'ai besoin de la carboglace.
OK, restez calme, Ellen.
Ellen !
S'il vous plaît, ne tirez pas !
Qui ętes-vous ?
- Ellen Tigh.
- Venez ici immédiatement.
Avancez !
Nous ne sommes pas des criminels.
Nous faisons partie de la flotte,
tout comme vous.
Mon mari est le XO du Galactica.
Vous venez de faire la pire
erreur de votre vie.
Colonel Tigh, Amiral...
Vous devez écouter ça.
<i>Saul...</i>
Ellen, qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
<i>Ils nous retiennent en otages.
Ils menacent de nous tuer.</i>
<i>Mon nom est Sesha Abinell.</i>
<i>J'ai pris le contrôle
du bar du Cloud Nine...</i>
<i>- et j'ai pris les gens en otages.
- Que voulez-vous ?</i>
Ce que je veux ?
Il ne s'agit pas...
de ce que je veux.
La flotte coloniale
<i>est devenue un territoire
occupé par les Cylons.</i>
<i>Vous travaillez en complicité
avec un agent cylon.</i>
<i>Le  męme modčle que le Cylon
qui a essayé de vous tuer,</i>
<i>Amiral Adama, ŕ bord de
votre propre vaisseau.</i>
Nous voulons Sharon Valerii.
<i>Vous avez deux heures.</i>
Trouvez-moi tout ce que vous pouvez
sur Sesha Abinell.
Oui, Monsieur.
Sesha Abinell...
Les archives de la flotte indiquent
qu'elle est la veuve de Ray Abinell.
Il a été tué sur le cargo Greenleaf
quand les Cylons l'ont attaqué
il y a dix semaines.
Une veuve...
Qui avons-nous ŕ bord du Cloud Nine ?
Le planning des rotations indique
le Capitaine Adama,
une demi-patrouille de marines,
et Starbuck est déjŕ lŕ-bas en repos.
- Passez-moi Starbuck au plus vite.
- Oui, Monsieur.
Merde, une de ces petites beautés
doit bien ętre un détecteur d'oxygčne.
Et je pense que c'est toi.
Prends une gorgée de dioxyde de carbone.
Il y avait un autre mec au bar.
Va voir derričre.
On ne doit plus faire d'erreurs.
Kern, il y a vraiment beaucoup de
militaires ici.
On est lŕ pour attirer l'attention
du Galactica, tu te rappelles ?
Page.
- T'y vas.
- Pas de problčme.
Contente de te voir, Gunny.
J'ai besoin de certains de
tes gorilles, des marines.
La plupart de mes gorilles
sont déjŕ lŕ, Madame.
- Ils essaient de se reposer.
- Tu m'étonnes.
Voilŕ ce qu'on sait.
On a un nombre inconnu de tireurs
et au moins 20 otages.
Dans 90 minutes, ils
commenceront ŕ les descendre.
Vous avez un plan, Madame ?
On se prépare, on verra
le reste par la suite.
Baissez votre arme.
Dites-leur.
Il dit qu'il est le capitaine Adama
du Galactica.
Il veut juste parler.
Parler, c'est tout, juste parler.
Ils sont ensemble.
Baissez votre arme ou elle meurt.
Si elle meurt, il meurt,
vous comprenez ?
La différence, c'est que
vous ne le ferez pas.
Lui, oui.
OK  ?
Nous tenons tous ŕ quelqu'un.
C'est son fils.
Il ne choisira pas la Cylon
ŕ la place de son fils.
Mettez-vous avec les autres.
Du CO2 sort du plafond.
Ils essaient de nous étouffer.
C'est quoi, un pičge ?
Ce n'est pas pour rien qu'on ne tire pas
dans un vaisseau spatial.
Vous avez dű percer une conduite.
Laissez-moi parler ŕ l'Amiral,
pour voir si on peut
trouver une solution.
J'ai deux équipes d'assaut
qui arrivent sur vous
dans environ 10 minutes.
On aura la puissance de feu,
ça c'est bon.
Ce qui m'inquičte ce sont
les point d'accčs.
Amiral ?
C'est Abinell.
Gardez Starbuck en ligne avec nous.
Adama.
Nous perdons de l'oxygčne.
Si ce n'est pas réparé,
les otages meurent.
Alors vous mourrez tous,
- parce que c'est terminé.
- Pas avant la mort de la Cylon.
Je suis pręte ŕ mourir pour ça.
Ętes-vous pręt ŕ risquer
la vie de votre fils ?
Putain de merde !
Tout d'un coup vous écoutez.
Bordel de Dieux, donnez-lui
ce qu'elle veut !
<i>Donnez-lui la Cylon.</i>
Vous ętes tout seul
sur ce coup lŕ, Amiral.
Je ne sacrifierai pas
un avantage militaire
sur l'autel de votre vengance.
De quoi parlez-vous ?
- C'est pas...
<i>- Vous disiez que c'était</i>
<i>ŕ cause des Cylons qui
nous manipulent</i>
<i>mais ce n'est pas vrai.</i>
<i>C'est ŕ cause de la mort de
votre mari et je comprends cela.</i>
<i>C'est parce que vous voulez
vous venger et je comprends cela aussi.</i>
Mais nous avons tous perdu
des personnes chčres
et nous avons appris ŕ vivre avec.
<i>Je suis sűre que vous ętes
au courant, Amiral</i>
de la preuve tangible
que les défenses de Caprica ont
été compromises par un agent cylon
qui a infiltré le Ministčre de la Défense
ŕ la veille de l'attaque.
Les gens cherchent
des explications compliquées
quand une tragédie arrive.
Peut-ętre qu'on s'est fait prendre
par surprise et qu'on s'est fait battre.
Peut-ętre qu'on doit
apprendre ŕ vivre avec.
<i>Et peut-ętre que vous
ne voyez pas le problčme.</i>
Vous avez été infiltrés.
Vous, les militaires.
Et vous ętes de nouveau infiltrés
en ce moment męme.
Vous pouvez prétendre savoir
ce que vous faites, mais c'est faux.
Vous ętes manipulé
et le reste d'entre nous ne veut pas
sombrer avec votre vaisseau.
<i>Je veux qu'on répare le systčme
d'aération tout de suite.</i>
<i>Une personne vient seule,</i>
<i>le répare et s'en va.</i>
Si quelque chose va mal,
si quelqu'un est blessé
c'est votre responsabilité.
Gardez une ligne ouverte vers le Cloud Nine.
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
On répare le systčme d'aération.
Saul, on ne peut pas leur donner Sharon.
J'espčre que tu le sais, non ?
Je le sais.
On ne négocie pas avec des terroristes.
Si on commence, c'est porte ouverte
et jamais ça s'arrętera.
Mais au fait,
c'est pas "Sharon".
- C'est un putain de Cylon.
- Tu crois que je ne le sais pas ?
Il y a une partie de toi qui regarde
dans les yeux de cette chose
et qui y voit encore la jeune fille
qui est arrivée ŕ bord
il y a deux ans comme jeune pilote,
et bien non.
Elle ne l'a jamais été.
Bill, c'est une machine.
Amiral, le Capitaine Thrace.
Au rapport.
<i>Un technicien du Cloud Nine</i>
a vérifié deux fois l'alimentation en
oxygčne, aucun problčme.
Peut-ętre un pépin technique.
Ou bien quelqu'un a bousillé
un des détecteurs de CO2 dans le bar.
Lee ?
Pourquoi ?
<i>Il nous offre peut-ętre une ouverture.</i>
Si je pouvais y introduire quelqu'un
pour éclaircir la situation...
<i>Kara, c'est une mission
de reconnaissance.</i>
<i>Trouvez un volontaire.</i>
Puis évaluez la situation.
<i>Ensuite vous foutez le camp de lŕ.
C'est compris ?</i>
Oui, Monsieur.
Je viens réparer
l'alimentation en oxygčne.
Capitaine,
qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Je me porte volontaire.
Donnez-moi ça.
Fermez l'écoutille.
Fouillez-la.
Vous ne devriez pas faire ça,
vous allez manquer d'air ici.
Ça a l'air en ordre.
Faites votre boulot.
Surveillez-la.
Attendez un peu.
Tournez-vous doucement.
Vérifiez la boîte ŕ nouveau.
C'est ŕ nous, allez !
A terre !
On doit sortir. Maintenant !
Venez !
Billy.
J'ai besoin de chemises, de serviettes,
tout ce qui peut servir de bandage.
Billy !
Personne ne vous a autorisé ŕ bouger.
Vous voulez toujours la Cylon ?
Oui ou non ?
Si le fils de l'Amiral meurt, vous
n'aurez pas d'arrangement, vous pigez ?
S'il meurt, vous n'aurez
pas ce que vous voulez.
Il a raison.
Laisse-le faire.
Monsieur, c'est Starbuck.
On nous a rapporté des coups de feu.
Que s'est-il passé ?
J'ai été démasquée, j'ai dű agir.
Je suis désolée.
<i>Des blessés ?</i>
Deux soldats.
Probablement morts...
Au moins un des preneurs d'otages.
Et Lee.
C'était dingue lŕ-dedans, confus.
<i>Il a été touché.</i>
C'est grave ?
Je ne sais pas.
<i>Tenez-vous pręts.</i>
Maintenez votre position. Ne faites rien
sans que je vous le dise.
<i>Le tir venait de chez nous.</i>
Lee a été touché par un tir ami.
Je pense que c'était moi.
Vous avez vos ordres.
- Je n'arrive pas ŕ arręter l'hémorragie.
- Qu'est-ce que je peux faire ?
Je dois arręter l'hémorragie.
Je ne sais pas si une artčre
est touchée ou...
Lee ?
Reste avec moi.
Lee, reste avec moi, d'accord ?
Je t'en prie.
Il va s'en sortir.
Accroche-toi, allez.
Reste avec moi. Je t'en prie.
Est-ce que vous nous manipulez ?
Est-ce que vous me manipulez ?
<i>J'ai sauvé le vaisseau.
<i>Je vous ai sauvé, vous.
<i>Combien de fois ?
<i>Cinq ?
<i>Six ?
<i>Vous n'arrivez toujours pas ŕ croire
que je ne conspire pas contre vous ?
Vous savez qu'il y a des Cylons
dans la flotte.
Vous savez ŕ quoi ils ressemblent,
vous savez oů les trouver.
Si je vous le demandais,
vous me diriez qui ils sont ?
<i>Non.
Ça, je le crois.
Il va s'en sortir.
Merci de s'en inquiéter.
Elle perd son mari et tout d'un coup
le monde lui doit une explication ?
C'était un homme bien.
Et il n'était pas que son mari,
c'était mon frčre.
Mon frčre est mort sur Picon,
lui aussi c'était un homme bien.
Ce sont tous des hommes bien.
Cette Abinell a fait parvenir un manifeste
ŕ la presse avant d'attaquer le bar.
C'est surtout un recueil de rumeurs
et de théories de conspiration
sur des Cylons dans l'armée
et le gouvernement.
- Foutaises.
- Il attire beaucoup d'attention.
On doit sortir nos gens de lŕ-bas.
Vous avez des soldats sur le Cloud Nine.
La porte pressurisée a été
refermée hermétiquement.
Pour l'ouvrir en la faisant sauter,
il nous faudrait tellement de G-4
qu'on risquerait de tuer
tout le monde ŕ l'intérieur.
Il ne reste plus qu'une solution.
Non.
Nous ne pouvons pas
céder aux terroristes.
Si nous leur donnons Valerii,
nous incitons le terrorisme
et nous nous rendons vulnérables
définitivement, vous le savez.
Messieurs, chacun des otages est
le fils, l'épouse, la mčre de quelqu'un.
Billy est le seul semblant
de famille qu'il me reste
et si vous croyez que cela ne me complique
pas les choses émotionnellement parlant,
- ne soyons pas naďfs.
- Et sils avaient raison ?
Et si Sharon nous avait manipulés,
complotant notre destruction
jour aprčs jour ?
Et si les terroristes avaient raison ?
Le problčme n'est pas Sharon.
C'est quelque chose de bien
plus grave que cela.
C'est notre survie ŕ long terme,
notre conduite face ŕ ces évčnements.
Monsieur ?
J'ai Abinell en ligne.
Comment va mon fils ?
<i>Il est vivant.</i>
<i>Mais mon ami est mort.</i>
<i>Ainsi que deux de vos soldats.</i>
<i>Et votre fils est en train de mourir.</i>
Vous savez, j'ai longuement
réfléchi ŕ tout ça.
A ce que j'allais faire.
Jusqu'oů j'irais.
Et franchement je ne le savais pas
<i>jusqu'ŕ maintenant.</i>
Chu.
Quoi ?
- Lčve-toi.
- Qu'allez-vous faire ?
Saul, donne leur ce qu'ils veulent !
C'est juste une machine !
Ils vont la tuer.
Ne tirez pas.
Je vous donne la Cylon.
Mais elle ne sera pas vivante.
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Ce n'est pas le marché.
<i>Ça veut dire que
vous m'avez convaincu</i>
que nous avons
peut-ętre été manipulés
et si c'est le cas
et qu'elle m'a manipulé,
alors je ne peux plus
prendre de risques.
Donc, ŕ vous de choisir.
Si vous voulez Sharon Valerii,
vous pouvez l'avoir,
mais selon mes conditions.
<i>Je vous donne le corps,
vous me donnez les otages.</i>
D'accord.
Coupez la liaison.
Amiral.
Laissez-moi vous aider,
s'il vous plaît.
Je vais m'en charger.
Allons-y.
Arręte de le regarder, Billy.
Je vois bien que tu l'observes.
Je sais que tu penses pouvoir
prendre son arme.
J'y pense seulement au cas oů
quelque chose arriverait.
Non.
Tu n'es pas soldat.
Tu n'es pas entrainé pour ça.
- Tu n'as rien ŕ prouver.
- Je sais.
Ils sont juste de l'autre côté.
On ouvre, ils nous donnent le corps.
OK.
On va ouvrir la porte
mais si quelque chose
tourne mal, on tue les otages.
Vas-y.
C'est fini.
Attends.
Quelque chose cloche.
Celle-lŕ est morte depuis des semaines.
Leur Cylon vit encore.
Tue la petite-amie.
Au rapport.
Zone dégagée.
J'ai besoin d'aide par ici.
Médecin !
Lee. Lee, tu m'entends ?
Lee !
Tu m'entends, Lee ?
Allez, fiston.
Allez, dépęchez-vous.
C'est bon.
Billy.
Non.
C'est ce que vous leur avez donné ?
C'était un risque calculé.
Ça n'en valait pas le coup.
Voilŕ, c'est mieux,
c'est mieux.
Il était si jeune.
Salut.
Salut...
Quoi ?
Rien.
Quand tu te sentiras mieux,
on pourra discuter.
C'était une sacrée permission.
Ouais.
Lee ?
Lee, tu peux pas partir.
Tu dois rester.
Tu dois vraiment rester.
Tu comprends ?
Ça va aller.
Je serai lŕ ŕ ton réveil.
Je serai lŕ.

ET ILS ONT UN PLAN.
<i>Précédemment dans Battlestar Galactica.</i>
Lee, tu ne peux pas partir.
Tu dois rester.
Tu dois vraiment rester.
Tu dois trahir Roslin et te présenter
aux prochaines élections présidentielles.
Je sais que c'est dur
mais c'est la seule façon.
Toute la flotte est au courant
du meurtre de Fisk.
Un équipage peut s'effondrer
si son commandant est tué.
Le Pegasus en a perdu deux
en quelques semaines.
Je place Garner aux commandes.
C'est un ingénieur,
il ne sait pas commander.
C'est ce qu'ils ont de mieux.
EXERCICE D'ENTRAÎNEMENT DE RAPTORS.
<i>Pegasus, ici Buster.</i>
Le dradis confirme que les Raptors
d'entraînement sont partis.
<i>Buster, ici Pegasus, bien reçu.
Prenez position...</i>
<i>Attention, les communications</i>
seront parfois interrompues
à cause d'IEM, reçu ?
<i>Pegasus, ici Buster, reçu.
La communication est pourrie.</i>
- Ça va être comme ça toute la journée ?
- Et comment.
Ce système binaire crée tellement
d'IEM que le dradis fonctionne à peine.
Je vais m'éloigner un peu de la flotte.
Qu'on sorte de cette soupe,
voir si on peut
avoir une meilleure réception.
<i> Ça suffit là-dedans ! Allez !</i>
<i>Il y a deux pilotes de Viper
crevés qui veulent dormir.</i>
Va te doucher, Duck.
On sera partis à ton retour.
Ça va ?
Pas vraiment.
Mais Cottle m'a donné le feu vert
depuis presque 1 mois,
donc je retourne travailler.
T'es prêt à plonger dans
le ventre de la Bête ?
- La Bête ?
- Ouais.
C'est le surnom du Pegasus.
Le Galactica est le Tacot.
Le Tacot et la Bête.
On fait pas un beau couple ?
Vas-y.
- Non, toi.
- Allez, vas-y.
De toute façon ce n'est
qu'une affectation temporaire.
Je devrais revenir
dans quelques semaines.
Pourquoi le patron t'a choisi ?
En un mot :
- Starbuck.
- Elle est encore en prison ?
Pas encore.
Mais apparemment,
elle rend Garner complètement fou
depuis qu'elle assure
la formation des pilotes sur...
Comment tu l'appelles déjà ? La Bête.
Et comme je ne vais
pas voler pendant un moment, je...
Est-ce que t'allais parler de ça ?
Ouais, on m'a promu au grade de Major.
Cache ta joie !
Ça veut pas dire grand chose.
Au contraire, ça veut dire beaucoup.
Et bien,
si tu le dis, ça doit être vrai.
Que se passe-t-il ?
On déchargeait un de ces containers et
une des caisses a bougé.
Alors on a regardé dedans
et on a vu quelque chose bouger.
Vous l'avez signalé ?
Oui, on a fermé les portes
et les soldats arrivent.
Donne-moi une lampe.
Chef, on ne sait pas ce que c'est.
On devrait pas attendre ?
Attends ici.
Chef ?
C'est le Galactica ?
Oui.
Vous êtes le docteur Cottle ?
<i>... en détresse...</i>
Bordel, c'était quoi ?
Je sais pas, on devrait le signaler.
Je fais chauffer le FTL au cas où.
Pegasus, ici le Raptor 718.
<i>Urgence... demande...</i>
Répétez, Shark.
<i>vons... détresse</i>
<i>... cap... dem... tion...</i>
Shark, répétez.
Signalez-vous une urgence ?
Buster, Shark, me recevez-vous ?
Shark, répétez.
Signalez-vous une urgence ?
<i>Commandant Garner sur le pont.</i>
Buster, Shark, me recevez-vous ?
- Il se passe quoi, M. Hoshi ?
- Je ne suis pas sûr, Monsieur.
Je crois que Buster et Shark signalent une
urgence mais la transmission est brouillée.
On les a perdus, Monsieur.

Green Fruit, Lama, Nikomagnus, The Cole
Bienvenue à bord, Major.
Je ne m'attendais pas
à un comité d'accueil.
Arrête de te la péter,
j'étais dans le coin.
- Le Major Adama, Monsieur.
- Major Adama.
- Commandant Garner.
- Content de vous voir, Major.
Ça aurait pu être à un meilleur moment.
On a perdu contact avec deux Raptors
en mission d'entraînement.
Quoi ? C'est arrivé quand ?
Capitaine Thrace.
Si vous aviez été sur le pont
d'envol à surveiller vos Raptors
comme tout
bon officier instructeur l'aurait fait,
vous sauriez que quatre
de nos pilotes ont disparu.
Major ?
Vous m'écoutez, Major ?
Oui, Monsieur.
Ils ont disparu du dradis
depuis une heure.
Ils sont manquants.
Vos gueules !
On perd deux Raptors
en mission d'entraînement
et je l'apprends seulement quand
le commandant me balance ça au visage.
- Parlez pas tous en même temps.
- Madame, on nous a fait comprendre
que parler des problèmes de vol à
quelqu'un d'extérieur au Pegasus
est interdit.
Désolé, Madame.
Qui a eu cette putain d'idée géniale ?
C'était Garner, n'est-ce pas ?
Bien sûr que oui.
Donc à peine compétent et parano.
Une sacrée combinaison.
J'ai un problème.
Son nom est Kara Thrace.
Je sais comment la gérer, Monsieur.
Au passage, c'est une super pilote.
Quoi ? Je devrais être indulgent
parcequ'elle pilote bien, c'est ça ?
Car personne n'a jamais été indulgent
avec nous, en salle des machines.
Je peux vous l'affirmer.
Mais, peut-être que les mécanos
sont différents des pilotes de Vipers.
Pas de cascades pour nous.
Pas de vols en siège éjectable.
La salle des machines
est comme une montre bien réglée.
Tout doit y être contrôlé et maintenu
de manière très précise.
Personne ne fait cavalier seul.
Tout doit être fait de la bonne manière,
au bon moment, dans le bon ordre.
Ou bien il n'y aurait
pas d'énergie, pas de lumière.
Pas de douches chaudes pour vos pilotes.
Vous savez, Major, certaines personnes ici
pourraient apprendre
deux ou trois choses des mécanos.
Excusez-moi
Madame la Présidente, mais c'est l'heure.
Réunion de campagne.
Vous la reportez depuis des semaines
et les élections présidentielles arrivent
sauf si vous ne vous présentez plus.
Pour être honnête avec vous Tori,
j'y ai pensé quelque fois mais...
Non, je reste.
Il y a tant à faire, donc...
Parlons de politique.
Super.
Voici les résultats
du premier sondage général de la flotte.
Comment y êtes-vous arrivée ?
J'étais à la tête de la cellule
électorale du parti fédéraliste
à Delphes pendant 5 ans.
On faisait des sondages pour savoir ce
que le maire devait manger.
Pour ce que ça vaut,
vous avez su trouver un consensus.
Votre candidature est soutenue
par la flotte militaire et civile.
et les chefs religieux de Gemini vous
appuient avec enthousiasme.
Ça aide que votre seul rival
soit un terroriste condamné.
Suis-je capable de diriger cette flotte ?
Absolument.
Et pendant un temps,
j'ai presque eu ma chance.
Jusqu'à ce que Laura Roslin
s'élève de politicienne à prophète.
En vérité, je ne peux pas gagner.
Mais vous, oui.
Vous me flattez, M. Zarek, vraiment.
Je ne pense pas être fait
pour la politique.
Je trouve déjà le poste de vice-président
et ses obligations très pénibles.
Je comprends que
de jouer au porteur d'eau pour Roslin
devienne fatigant
à la longue mais c'est le poste
qui fait de vous
le candidat parfait, Docteur.
Vous êtes vendeur.
Vraiment ?
Pour qui ?
Vous seriez surpris
du nombre de gens désireux
de voir la science pure
l'emporter sur les superstitions
délirantes des Geminiens.
En tant que scientifique,
vous apportez de l'espoir.
Pensez-y.
Et vous, Tom...
Vous vous écarterez, n'est-ce pas ?
Je suis content d'appuyer
un homme de conviction.
Un homme...
qui se souvient de ses amis.
Garde à vous.
Repos.
Où est Stinger ?
Dans ses quartiers,
il a fait grimacer Garner,
en marchant sur ses précieux orteils.
Putain de Garner.
- Il est vraiment con.
- OK, fermez-la !
Mettons les choses au point.
On a deux Raptors disparus qui
vont manquer d'oxygène dans 36 heures.
C'est tout ce qui compte.
Donc tout le monde arrête les enfantillages
et fait son putain de boulot.
Maintenant,
on doit commencer
à réfléchir différemment.
Ce qui est censé être
ce que vous faites le mieux.
Désolée, Major.
Bon,
je veux tout savoir
sur ces Raptors et leurs équipages.
Je veux connaître leurs manies,
leurs ennuis de vols,
les transmissions radio,
tout ce qui peut aider.
Bien, allez-y.
- Comment va-t-elle ?
- Rya est enceinte de 4 mois
et ne veut plus l'être.
Je sais que les Geminiens
n'apprécient pas les femmes qui avortent.
Tyrol a dit qu'elle
vous a demandé par votre nom.
Vous pouvez me dire
de quoi il s'agit vraiment ?
C'est très simple.
On m'informe qu'une fille va venir.
Elle arrive,
je fais mon travail et elle part.
- Je ne pose pas beaucoup de questions.
- Vous allez commencer.
Je veux parler avec elle.
Je suis l'Amiral Adama.
N'ayez pas peur, je veux juste parler.
Je me fiche de ce que vous direz,
je ne changerai pas d'avis.
Vos parents s'inquiètent pour vous.
Ils m'ont contacté par l'intermédiaire
de la représentante de Geminon.
Mes parents...
Dieux...
Vous avez une idée
de ce qu'ils me feront ?
S'il vous plaît, ne me renvoyez pas.
Vous êtes un passager clandestin
sur un vaisseau militaire.
Certains diraient qu'elle est victime
de persécution politique.
Merde,
elle pourrait demander l'asile.
L'asile.
C'est ça.
Je demande l'asile.
Selon les lois de Gemini, la fille est
toujours la propriété de ses parents
et ils pourront s'occuper d'elle
dès qu'elle reviendra sur son vaisseau.
Honnêtement,
je suis plus préoccupée par
les conséquences à grande echelle.
- Sarah.
- Je sais que vous ne voulez pas l'entendre.
Mais mon peuple, mes électeurs
exigent une réaction.
Nous en avons déjà parlé.
L'avortement était légal
selon les lois coloniales
avant les attaques
et est donc encore légal aujourd'hui.
C'est obscène.
Les Écritures considèrent l'avortement
comme une abomination aux yeux des Dieux.
Vous n'éviterez pas ce sujet si vous voulez
notre soutien aux prochaines élections.
La demande d'asile de Rya Kibby
est en cours d'examen.
Merci beaucoup, Sarah, d'être venue.
Je ne leur donnerai pas cette jeune fille.
Je ne vais sûrement pas
interdire l'avortement.
Ne le faites pas, alors.
Mais on doit agir
agressivement sur ce point.
Je vais arranger une
conférence de presse avec vous et le Quorum,
sinon on va vite perdre
le contrôle de cette affaire.
Elle n'est pas Billy.
En effet.
Quoi ?
Je déteste dire ça.
Car je sais que
c'est un problème politique.
Le fait est que ce nombre là
n'augmente pas souvent.
J'ai combattu pour le droit des femmes
à disposer de leur corps toute ma carrière.
Non...
Non...
Je viens de me rappeler de ce que
vous avez dit juste après l'attaque cylon.
Que si l'on veut
vraiment sauver l'espèce humaine,
on a intérêt à faire des bébés.
Rien, rien
et encore plus de rien.
Où est la dernière
transmission de Shark ?
Y a pas grand chose à en tirer.
<i>vons... détresse...</i>
<i>vons... détresse... cap...
dem... tion... gence... recevez.</i>
Ils sont perdus.
Ils demandent leur cap :
"demandons instructions."
"C'est une urgence.
Vous nous recevez ?"
Peut-être, mais que
vient faire "vons" ici ?
<i>vons... Détresse...</i>
<i>appel</i>
vons... recevons ?
Recevons appel de détresse.
D'accord, de qui ?
Je sais pas mais c'est peut-être
pour le découvrir qu'ils sont partis.
Commandant, le Capt. Thrace
a une théorie sur les Raptors manquants.
C'est bien, étant donné
qu'elle les a perdus.
Pardon ?
Ils étaient bien sortis pour une de
vos prétendues missions de formation ?
- Mes "prétendues" missions de formation ?
- OK, restons calmes.
Quand vous ne picolez pas ou que
vous ne suscitez pas de mutinerie.
- Mutinerie ?
- Cdt. on devrait en parler en privé.
Vous pensez que j'ignore
ce qui se passe sur mon vaisseau ?
"A peine compétent" ?
Et "parano" ?
C'était en privé.
Je me défoulais...
- J'avais raison.
- Je vous ferai passer en cour martiale.
Commandant, je ne défends pas
le comportement du Capt. Thrace...
Merci, Major.
Capt. Thrace, vous êtes
consignée dans vos quartiers.
Jusqu'à votre retour sur le Galactica.
Vous êtes le toutou d'Adama,
qu'il se débrouille avec vous.
- Major ?
- Oui, Monsieur...
Tu es là depuis moins de 4 jours
et tu es déjà aux arrêts.
- Tu ne perds pas de temps.
- Toi non plus, Lee.
Ça fait quoi d'être
le copain de jeux de Garner ?
Je suis ici pour
faire mon boulot !
Oui, garder cette grande gueule indisciplinée
de Kara Thrace dans le droit chemin.
- Ça marche pas terrible on dirait.
- Visiblement, non.
Il reste peu de temps,
ces gars sont presque à court d'air.
J'ai essayé, d'accord ?
Depuis que je suis sur la Bête,
j'ai essayé d'aider
et je n'ai reçu que les
coups de pieds au cul de Garner.
Peut-être que t'as
besoin d'un coup de pied dans le cul !
Bien...
Nous y voilà, enfin.
C'est quoi ton problème ?
C'est quoi mon problème ?
C'est quoi mon problème...
Kara, c'est toi mon problème.
Tu continues à merder,
et c'est moi qui dois nettoyer
et j'en ai officiellement ma claque.
Pauvre Lee, ta vie est tellement dure.
Tu veux dire depuis
qu'on m'a tiré dessus ?
Tu veux ma théorie sur
ce qui est arrivé à Buster ou pas ?
Pegasus, ici Red Devil. Je m'approche de
la dernière position connue de nos Raptors.
<i>Répète... urg...</i>
<i>détr...</i>
Buster, c'est toi ?
Buster, c'est Red Devil.
C'est toi, mon pote ? Réponds-moi.
<i>Panne de courant.
Presque plus d'oxygène...</i>
<i>Pour l'amour des Dieux, aidez-nous.</i>
Monsieur,
un de nos Raptors a capté
un possible signal de détresse
près de l'endroit où nous
avons perdu contact avec Buster.
Enfin.
"Possible" signal de détresse.
En théorie, il se peut
que Buster lui-même ait sauté
en réponse à un faux appel de détresse.
C'est peut-être un piège.
En théorie ?
C'est votre théorie, Major ?
C'est la théorie du Capt. Thrace, non ?
M. Thornton, pouvez-vous repérer
d'où vient ce signal de détresse ?
Oui, Monsieur.
Longue distance, plus de 40 UA.
Alors démarrez le FTL,
et préparez le saut du vaisseau.
Oui, Monsieur.
Monsieur.
Ce n'est pas que
la théorie du Capt. Thrace.
- Je pense que c'est un piège cylon, et...
- Et je ne suis pas d'accord.
Passez-moi l'Amiral Adama.
Je vais récupérer nos hommes.
Amiral, on a enfin repéré
la source et le cap du signal de détresse.
Je peux y être
en moins de 2 minutes.
Commandant, croyez-moi,
je sais ce que vous ressentez.
Mais on sait que les Cylons
leurrent les vaisseaux
avec de faux signaux de détresse.
<i>- Y avez-vous réfléchi ?</i>
- Oui, Monsieur.
C'est un scénario que
nous estimons improbable.
Nous ?
<i>Major Adama, êtes-vous d'accord ?</i>
Monsieur...
Le Capt. Thrace et moi pensons
que les deux premiers Raptors ont
pu être piégés par une telle ruse.
Une opinion que
je ne partage pas, Monsieur.
Nous enverrons
une mission de reconnaissance.
Cinq Raptors.
Trois équipes d'escorte, deux de secours.
<i>Vous avez vos ordres, Commandant.</i>
Oui, Monsieur, merci, Monsieur.
Merci, Major.
Je suis sûr que votre expertise
est requise ailleurs.
Oui, Monsieur.
Oui, je suis curieux.
Pourquoi cet intérêt soudain pour les
projections démographiques de la flotte ?
Un problème s'est manifesté
et pourrait diviser notre administration.
Je voudrais avoir tous les faits
avant de prendre ma décision.
C'est "notre" administration, maintenant ?
Elle doit être désespérée.
Je suis un homme très occupé.
Par chance, j'avais fait
un premier calcul il y a sept mois
quand cela ne semblait intéresser personne.
J'ai juste dû intégrer l'équipage du Pegasus.
Ça n'a pas pris trop de temps,
ça ne m'a pas embêté.
Je vais vous épargner
la peine de lire le rapport.
Si nous continuons à notre rythme actuel,
d'ici 18 ans,
l'espèce humaine aura tout simplement
disparu.
<i>Depuis ma prise de fonction, j'ai eu
pour mission de maintenir les droits</i>
<i>et les libertés dont
nous jouissions avant l'attaque.</i>
<i>Un de ces droits
entre désormais en conflit direct</i>
<i>avec la survie de l'espèce.</i>
<i>Je me vois contrainte
de prendre une décision très difficile.</i>
<i>La question est complexe.</i>
<i>Le fait est que
si la civilisation veut survivre,</i>
<i>nous devons absolument
repeupler cette flotte.</i>
<i>Par conséquent, je lance un décret.</i>
<i>A partir d'aujourd'hui,</i>
<i>quiconque cherchant à empêcher
la naissance d'un enfant,</i>
que ce soit la mère...
ou un médecin...
fera l'objet de poursuites pénales.
Je vous remercie.
<i>Tout le personnel de pont,
rejoignez vos postes.</i>
D'accord, allez, on y va !
Capitaine Case,
qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
On nous ordonne de décoller,
Condition 1.
Le vaisseau se prépare à sauter.
On décollera de l'autre côté.
- Descends au hangar de pont !
- Quoi ?
Écoute, tu es notre meilleure pilote
alors descends et trouve un Viper.
T'en as mis du temps à l'admettre !
- Commandant, quelle est la situation ?
- C'est une mission de sauvetage.
- Sous l'autorité de qui ?
- La mienne, je ramène mes pilotes.
Sauf votre respect, Monsieur,
mais si c'est un piège des Cylons,
alors on s'engage en aveugles !
- On devrait faire une reconnaissance...
- Mes pilotes meurent là-bas !
J'y vais, je n'attendrai
pas la reconnaissance !
Commandant, c'est une violation
directe des ordres de l'Amiral.
Major, sortez du C.I.C.
C'est donc une action
illégale de votre part !
Vous êtes relevé, Major !
Sergent.
Je dois prendre le commandement
de ce vaisseau !
Cet homme a
directement désobéi à un ordre.
- Je vous mets aux arrêts !
- Je veux qu'il soit arrêté !
Sergent.
Emmenez-le.
Sergent, le cdt. a convenablement
été relevé, escortez-le à ses quartiers.
Cet homme n'appartient pas
à cet équipage et vous allez obéir
à l'ordre que je vous ai donné
et vous allez le faire maintenant.
Major, venez avec moi.
Amiral ! Le Pegasus a sauté.
Ils sont partis.
Rien sur le Dradis.
Aucune interférence dans le secteur.
Monsieur, je vois deux Raptors.
Les codes correspondent, ce sont les nôtres.
Monsieur Hoshi.
Dites au CAG de lancer notre équipe
de sauvetage et ramenons les nôtres.
A vos ordres.
Pegasus, ici Red Devil.
Nos oiseaux ont l'air intacts.
<i>Je ne peux pas bien
voir l'intérieur encore.</i>
<i>Commandant, nous ne parvenons pas
à contacter les Raptors par radio.</i>
Pegasus, les équipages
des deux Raptors sont morts.
<i>Je répète, ils sont tous morts.</i>
Monsieur, trois Vaisseaux-mère cylons
viennent de sauter à portée de tir.
Oh, Dieux.
Ils lancent des missiles nucléaires !
Préparez-vous à l'impact.
Rapport de dégâts ?
Deux explosions nucléaires
à l'arrière, Monsieur.
- Moteur FTL inopérant, Monsieur.
- Nous sommes coincés ici, Monsieur.
<i>OK, Showboat...</i>
Tu prends l'escadron bleu,
attaquez-les par la droite.
Catbird, tu prends le vert,
attaquez-les par la gauche.
Les autres, suivez-moi.
On leur rentre dans le lard.
Sergent, je pense que
vous avez mieux à faire.
Alors le cône d'hélice est intact ?
Ça doit être un détecteur, tire-le.
Non, non, écoute-moi, tire-le !
Explosion nucléaire.
Dégâts structurels le long
de l'échangeur de chaleur supérieur.
On peut plus tenir longtemps.
Combien avant la réparation FTL ?
Je ne sais pas,
ils n'ont pas l'air de comprendre.
Je dois descendre là-bas.
Vous avez le pont.
Oui, Monsieur.
J'ai le pont.
Cap sur le Vaisseau-mère le plus proche.
Pivotez pour garder notre partie
supérieure hors de leur feu.
Hoshi, contactez Starbuck et Case,
dites-leur que
j'ai pris le commandement.
Qu'elles protègent
la partie supérieure du vaisseau.
Oui, Monsieur.
Reçu, Pegasus.
On protège vos arrières.
Monsieur Gaeta, un contact ?
Négatif, Monsieur.
Donnez-moi ça.
Je peux passer par là ?
Ennemi droit devant
en approche rapide !
On ne peut plus encaisser
de coups comme ça.
Navigation.
Maintenez le cap.
Préparez les batteries avant
pour une salve continue.
- Visez leur axe central.
- Oui, Monsieur.
Voyons si on peut
inverser les chances.
Il faut que le FTL soit bientôt réparé
ou on est morts.
2200, la batterie principale
a une fenêtre de tir.
Feu.
La pression du liquide de
refroidissement est trop basse.
L'arrivée d'air principale est bouchée.
La pression baisse, on a une brèche
quelque part dans la coque.
On doit aller là-dedans
ouvrir la valve auxiliaire !
- On peut pas faire ça, Monsieur !
- On doit le faire !
Monsieur, cette brèche pourrait
vider tout notre oxygène dans l'espace.
On n'a pas le choix, ouvrez l'écoutille.
Équipement respiratoire ?
On les a tous utilisés
en combattant les feux, Monsieur.
Donnez-moi un marteau
et une clé de 12.
OK.
Fermez cette écoutille derrière moi.
On perd de l'air, fermez
cette maudite écoutille, fermez-la !
Le Vaisseau-mère se détourne.
Putain, il s'enfuit, Major !
Mais pas les deux autres.
Ils reviennent en force.
Navigation !
Bâbord toute !
Je suis devant le collecteur.
Je vais voir si je peux l'actionner.
Oui !
Il y a vraiment une fuite d'air,
par une fissure au-dessus du relais SVC.
La brèche est derrière.
Starbuck dit que les Vipers
sont à court de munitions, Major.
On va devoir les abattre
aux cailloux ces salopards.
On doit virer nos culs d'ici
maintenant, Monsieur !
Monsieur !
Allez, Garner.
L'oxygène est dans le rouge, patron.
Vous allez manquer d'air.
Vous avez réussi, la pression remonte !
Maintenant foutez le camp d'ici, allez !
Il n'y a plus d'air, patron, sortez de là !
Patron ?
On a le feu vert de la salle
des machines. FTL opérationnel et paré.
OK, commencez la préparation du saut.
Ramenez les oiseaux au nid.
Pegasus ici Starbuck. Il n'y a plus
que des toasteurs derrière moi.
- Sortez-nous d'ici, maintenant !
- Tous les chasseurs sont à bord.
Baies d'appontage rentrées.
Sautez !
Tu attribues beaucoup de mérite à Garner.
Et bien, tout est vrai.
Il a sacrifié sa vie pour son vaisseau.
Le rapport de Starbuck
n'était pas si tendre.
Elle a sa façon de voir les choses.
Et j'ai la mienne.
À ton avis, juste entre nous...
Quel était le défaut de Garner ?
Il était habitué à travailler
avec des machines.
Commander c'est une affaire d'humain.
Souviens-t'en.
Puisque tu prends le commandement
de la Bête.
Garner était mon choix.
Son échec est ma responsabilité.
Fais que je ne me trompe pas
une seconde fois.
Félicitations, Commandant.
Madame la Présidente.
On dit que vous n'avez pas l'intention
de poursuivre la fille de Gemini
à bord du Galactica.
Elle a un nom, Sarah.
Je pense que
Rya a suffisamment souffert.
Elle vient juste
de subir un avortement.
Je lui ai accordé
asile sur le Galactica.
C'est en complète violation de la loi.
Mon décret est venu après l'intervention,
aucune loi n'a été enfreinte.
La fille doit revenir à son foyer,
avec ses parents, j'insiste.
Vous avez eu plus que votre dû.
et je vous suggère de savourer votre
victoire et de passer à autre chose.
Madame.
Tu réalises que t'es baisé ?
Toute la pression, la responsabilité,
les nuits blanches,
tous les officiers te menant la vie dure.
Et bien ça pourrait être pire.
Tu pourrais être mon CAG.
Je vais rester ici
et être le CAG du Galactica.
On veut pouvoir me garder à lœil.
Toi et le Colonel Tigh allez beaucoup
vous amuser aux briefings matinaux.
Car le XO est avant tout
un grand comique.
Génial...
Félicitations.
Vraiment.
Félicitations.
Tu le mérites.
Je sais pourquoi je t'en voulais, Kara.
Un simple merci aurait suffi.
Car tu faisais
ce que tu as toujours fait.
Défier l'autorité... en toute impunité.
J'ai bravé l'autorité une fois.
Et j'ai presque tout perdu.
Je suppose que quand je t'ai vue
sur le Pegasus et que tu
étais en train de recommencer.
Je sais pas.
Ça m'a fait chier.
Ça veut pas dire grand chose, non ?
Tu devrais voir mon cerveau
fonctionner certaines fois.
C'est réglé alors ?
T'as un cerveau ?
Madame la Présidente, votre décision de
criminaliser l'avortement fait scandale.
Pensez-vous que cela ait nui
à votre cote dans les sondages ?
- Certainement.
- Puis-je, Madame la Présidente ?
Il est vrai qu'à la lumière
des derniers évènements,
la Présidente ait pu perdre
du soutien parmi certains.
Je demanderais aux gens de comprendre
que si c'est une mesure extrême,
nous vivons des temps extrêmes.
La décision a été prise de bonne foi.
Cependant, je ne peux
en toute conscience la soutenir.
Je suis vraiment désolé,
Madame la Présidente.
Mais les Cylons n'ont aucune idée
du sens du mot liberté.
Comment le pourraient-ils ?
Ils sont programmés.
Des machines.
A chaque fois que vous nous
enlevez une de nos libertés,
à chaque restriction ou diminution
d'un de nos droits,
nous leur ressemblons un peu plus.
En tant que Vice-président,
Je suis tenu de suivre
l'action de ce gouvernement.
En tant que Président...
je n'aurais pas
ce genre de restrictions.
Étant donné la situation,
J'ai bien peur de n'avoir d'autre choix
que d'annoncer, dès lors,
ma candidature à la Présidence.

Ils reconstruisent Caprica.

Je suis Sharon...

J'ai dťcidť que tu ťtais une manifestation

Donc je suis...

Un honneur qu'elle mťrite ŗ peine mais
personne ne peut douter de la volontť de Dieu.

J'ťtais dans une maison.

AUJOURD'HUI
CAPRICA SOUS OCCUPATION CYLON
Je me disais que
Áa symbolise une renaissance.
Un nouveau dťpart.
C'est un monument funťraire.
Sais-tu combien de gens sont morts
dans ce parc pendant l'attaque†?
Combien juste dans ce parc†?
«a va Ítre ravissant, non†?
Dťsolťe.
Un endroit oý se reposer et
rassembler ses esprits.
Comment tu vas†?
Je suis un peu engourdie.
J'essaie toujours
de m'habituer ŗ ce corps.
Je sais que c'est le mÍme, mais...
mÍme aprŤs tout ce temps,
je me sens mal ŗ l'aise.
J'ťtais empotťe moi aussi,
je faisais tout tomber...
Je trťbuchais sur n'importe quoi.
Et tu sais quoi†? Tu le surmontes.
Et tu sais quoi,
c'est une grande occasion de se purifier.
Tu as un nouveau corps,
une nouvelle vie.
Et tout ce que tu as accumulť...
Les anxiťtťs, les remords, la culpabilitť,
laisse-les disparaÓtre.
Je ne peux pas te dire
ŗ quel point je te remercie.
Tu as ťtť d'une grande aide.
Non, c'est moi qui te remercie.
Nous tous.
Tu es un hťros de guerre.
Nous n'aurions pas pu gagner sans toi.
Excusez-moi.
Je voulais juste vous dire que c'est un
honneur de vous avoir parmi nous sur Caprica.
Ce que vous avez fait,
c'est stimulant.
Merci.
AUJOURD'HUI
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA
Comment Áa va†?
Je crŤve de froid.
Je sens pas mes jambes.
C'est la pťridurale.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passť†?
Tu t'es ťvanouie et tu as
recommencť ŗ saigner, mais tout ira bien.
Tu parles que Áa va aller.
Je trouve Áa fascinant.
Vous vous Ítes cassťs la tÍte ŗ copier
les humains sans amťliorer la tuyauterie.
Le placenta est dťcollť.
Le bťbť doit sortir maintenant
ou on pourrait vous perdre tous les deux
Monsieur, pourriez-vous
vous ťloigner.
Elle fait de la tachycardie,
sa pression sanguine diminue.
Oui, elle perd du sang ŗ nouveau.
On va devoir l'ouvrir maintenant.
Sharon, tu m'entends†?
Helo.
J'arrive pas ŗ m'y faire.
Tu es un hťros des Cylons, maintenant.
- Notre premiŤre cťlťbritť.
- Non, je ne suis qu'une autre Six.
Tu es trop modeste, je ne suis
qu'une autre Trois, voilŗ des Cinq...
et des Huit.
Mais toi, tout le monde
t'appelle la Six de Caprica.
Comme si tu ťtais
la seule Six sur la planŤte.
Ce que tu as fait
ťtait incroyablement difficile.
Sťduire un homme,
ťmotionnellement et physiquement
ŗ tel point qu'il te donne accŤs
aux secrets les mieux
gardťs de son peuple.
Cette mission aurait
pu Ítre trŤs dťrangeante.
Dťrangeante†?
Coucher avec moi
ou tuer des milliards de personnes†?
Tu aimais bien coucher avec moi, non†?
C'ťtait difficile, des fois.
Personne ici ne peut
comprendre ce que tu as endurť,
c'est pour Áa que
nous avons besoin de ton aide.
Un autre cylon a du mal
ŗ se rťintťgrer suite au transfert.
Un autre hťros, en fait.
Une Huit...
Elle se fait toujours appeler Sharon.
Et tu as cru que je pourrais aider†?
J'ai encore...
J'ai mes propres soucis.
Caprica, tu ne comprends pas,
elle a vraiment besoin de ton aide.
Si elle continue ainsi,
il se pourrait qu'on l'archive.
Mettre ses souvenirs en
chambre froide. Tu plaisantes†?
Charmante faÁon de gťrer
les problŤmes ťmotionnels.
On pourrait presque
la qualifier d'inhumaine.
Suis je bÍte, vous l'Ítes.
…coute, tu es notre
dernier recours, mais elle rťgresse.
S'il te plaÓt.
Elle vit dans un appartement lŗ-haut. Celui
qu'elle avait quand elle se croyait humaine.
La sťcuritť est minimale.
Une patrouille de deux Centurions devant.
Une 3Ťme tÍte de boulon
qui fait une ronde.
Cette tÍte de boulon patrouille en
changeant alťatoirement son parcours.
«a va Ítre dur de le passer.
OK, on passera sous lui.
L'ťgout mŤne directement
au parking sous le cafť.
Il y aura des douzaines
de peaux douces ŗ l'intťrieur.
Elle ne respire pas.
- Intubez-la.
- Tout de suite.
Oý vous l'emmenez†?
Ses poumons ne sont pas totalement formťs.
On doit l'aider ŗ respirer.
Mais elle est vivante, n'est-ce pas†?
Voilŗ votre rťponse.
Maintenant, sortez d'ici.
On doit arrÍter les saignements
de la mŤre ou on va la perdre.
Vous Ítes lŗ pour me virer†?
Non.
Vous Ítes lŗ pour
m'aider ŗ me rťadapter†?
Je vais vous faire gagner du temps.
C'est chez moi.
Je ne partirai pas.
J'ai vťcu sur Caprica pendant deux ans.
Je savais ce que j'ťtais...
Je faisais semblant
d'Ítre humaine, mais je savais.
Si vous saviez, en vivant sur Caprica
vous savez ce que Áa fait de vous†?
Une trŤs bonne menteuse.
Commence par les ťlťphants.
Ils sont trŤs beaux.
Ithaquťens†?
Sculptťs ŗ la main.
Ma mŤre me les a donnťs
le jour de mon dťpart pour l'Acadťmie.
C'est elle†?
C'est censť l'Ítre.
Bien sŻr, ce n'est pas rťel.
Spťcialement conÁue pour ma mission.
Tout Áa n'est qu'un mensonge.
Suivre le sentier de Dieu est difficile.
Pas de religion avec celle-lŗ.
A quoi tu penses†?
Comme si je m'intťressais ŗ ton dieu.
…coute, Dieu t'aime.
«a, c'est de l'amour.
Ces gens m'aimaient.
Je les aime.
Je ne simulais pas ces sentiments
pour baiser les gens.
Je les aime.
Et je les ai trahis.
J'ai tirť sur un homme que j'aimais...
J'en ai dťtruit un autre, ruinť sa vie†!
Et pourquoi†?
Car je suis une machine qui ment†!
Je suis un putain de Cylon†!
Pardon. Je ne voulais pas...
Je vais chercher un pansement.
Bien jouť.
Ton timing ťtait parfait.
S'ťgratigner le visage avec un ongle
quand le verre touche le mur.
Je n'ai jamais vu un Cylon avoir peur.
Surtout une Six.
Elles sont si dures.
Feindre la peur et la vulnťrabilitť
ťmotionnelle, tu es vraiment douťe.
Mais je suis meilleur,
laisse-moi t'aider.
"Je suis diffťrente."
Je suis diffťrente.
"Je suis comme toi."
Je suis comme toi.
J'ai rencontrť quelqu'un ici.
Un homme.
Je l'aimais et je crois
qu'il aurait pu m'aimer lui aussi.
Une demi-cigarette devrait nous laisser
2 ou 3 minutes pour foutre le camp.
Plus que Áa et ils pourraient
dťcouvrir les explosifs avant explosion.
C'est deux minutes ou trois†?
On va le savoir bientŰt.
C'est une opťration risquťe
juste pour buter quelques peaux douces.
On peut pas les tuer.
Ils se transfŤrent
dans un nouveau corps et...
A quoi bon†?
La peau douce avec Starbuck,
"Sharon" qu'ils l'appellent...
Elle a dit qu'aprŤs le transfert
ils se souviennent de tout.
Tout jusqu'ŗ la fin.
Ces peaux douces se souviendront s'Ítre
faits dťchiqueter en mille morceaux.
«a doit faire mal.
Oui, j'espŤre que
Áa fait vraiment mal.
TŰt ou tard, le message passera.
Il n'y a pas d'endroit sŻr, pas mÍme un cafť.
S'ils veulent sortir de l'enfer,
arrÍter de mourir sans cesse,
qu'ils se barrent de notre planŤte.
3 minutes et 10 secondes.
Boum†!
Cette maison surplombait un lac.
J'ai toujours adorť la vue.
Le soleil se couchant sur l'eau,
mon coin prťfťrť dans l'Univers.
Oui, c'ťtait magique.
Dommage que tu l'aies atomisť.
AprŤs mon transfert, je suis
retournťe sur les ruines de sa maison.
Pourquoi†?
Comme toi,
je recherchais un lien avec lui.
J'ai trouvť des trucs ŗ lui.
Je m'y suis mÍme accrochť un temps mais
j'ai rťalisť que Áa m'empÍchait
d'accepter ma nouvelle vie.
Alors qu'en as-tu fait†?
Je les ai brŻlťs.
Mais je me suis sentie libťrťe.
C'est une trŤs belle histoire, hein†?
Dommage que Áa soit
un tissu de mensonges.
Qui c'ťtait,
cet homme que tu aimais ?
Peut-Ítre tu as entendu parler de lui.
Gaius Baltar.
Le Docteur Baltar†?
Oui.
Il t'a donnť accŤs
au rťseau de dťfense colonial.
C'est lui qui nous a trahis†?
"Nous." J'adore.
Celle lŗ pense Ítre
plus humaine que cylon.
Comme une autre que je connais.
Il travaille encore pour les Cylons†?
Quoi†?
Sur le Galactica†?
Il est vivant†?
C'est le Vice-prťsident des Colonies.
Tu ne le savais pas†?
Si le bťbť survit, la question c'est :
Qu'est-ce qu'on va en faire ?
En faire†?
Que suggťrez-vous†?
Qu'on le balance par un sas†?
Je ne fais pas de suggestions, M. Baltar,
si je voulais passer
un bťbť par un sas, je le dirais.
C'est rassurant qu'il
ne soit pas question d'infanticide ici.
Dois-je rappeler que
ce n'est pas un enfant†?
- C'est une machine.
- Non, elle est mi-machine, mi-humaine.
J'aimerais qu'on garde Áa en tÍte.
Les Cylons se sont donnťs
beaucoup de mal pour crťer cette chose.
Il va sans dire
que si c'est bon pour eux,
ce sera mauvais pour nous.
Je suis entiŤrement d'accord.
Il est hors de question
de laisser Sharon l'ťlever.
Cela serait dťsastreux.
Il y a autre chose ŗ considťrer.
Il y a des Cylons dans cette flotte.
S'ils dťcouvrent cette naissance,
ils tenteront quelque chose.
Tu vois oý Áa nous mŤne, Gaius.
Nous allons devoir
reprendre notre enfant.
Bonjour, Hťra.
Elle a de la poigne.
T'aimes pas Ítre
lŗ-dedans, hein Hťra†?
Tu dois y rester le temps
que tes poumons se renforcent.
C'est notre petite fille.
On l'a faite.
«a vous ferait presque
croire au dieu cylon.
Presque.
Je t'aime tellement.
La voie est libre.
Tiens, prends Áa.
Allons-y.
Et voilŗ.
A ton avis,
pourquoi ils te l'ont cachť†?
Lŗ n'est pas la question.
La question c'est pourquoi nous faire
collaborer sachant que tu me dirais tout†?
Elle sait que j'aimais Gaius.
Elle sait que j'ai du mal ŗ l'oublier.
Elle devait savoir que Áa remuerait
ces sentiments et ces souvenirs.
Elle t'entube.
- Tu ne le vois pas†?
- Mais pourquoi†?
C'est parfaitement clair.
Pour des intelligences artificielles,
vous Ítes parfois incroyablement limitťs.
- Oh bon Dieu†!
- Attention†!
Tout va bien†?
TrŤs bien.
Nous discutions avec Sharon.
Oui†? De quoi†?
Elle me demande de dťmťnager.
Tu sais quoi†? C'est ce que nous
lui demandons depuis des semaines.
J'espťrais bien que tu trouves
la voie en parlant ŗ notre amie prťsente.
Malheureusement, elle ment.
Elle ne souhaite pas voir guťrir Sharon.
Ils vont vraiment le faire.
Ils vont l'archiver.
Y a combien de Cylons dans le cafť†?
La totale, au moins quarante.
3 minutes et 10 secondes.
On vient de faire une avancťe.
Elle a acceptť de dťmťnager.
N'est-ce pas, Sharon†?
Oui.
Je quitte cet appartement.
Quand†?
N'importe quand.
Pourquoi pas maintenant†?
J'aiderai.
L'appartement est juste ŗ l'ťtage.
Bien sŻr.
Je vais juste
rťcupťrer quelques trucs.
Beau travail Six,
Áa n'a pas dŻ Ítre facile.
Oui, nous avons beaucoup discutť.
- Elle est juste derriŤre toi.
- Je sais.
Il n'y a pas ŗ discuter.
Cet enfant ne sera pas
ťlevť par la Cylon.
Je ne peux pas risquer que
des agents cylons
mettent la main dessus,
j'ai pris ma dťcision.
Ce dont j'ai besoin,
Docteur, c'est de votre aide.
TrŤs bien, je n'aime pas Áa,
mais faisons ŗ votre maniŤre.
J'en ai besoin tout de suite.
Nous devons trouver quelqu'un qui convienne.
Je vais devoir faire une liste de noms.
Chacun d'eux est capable,
chacun d'eux est anonyme.
et chacun est digne de confiance.
Vous avez pensť ŗ tout, n'est-ce pas†?
Je l'espŤre.
Tu vas bien, Sharon†?
Qu'est-ce qu'il s'est passť†?
Une explosion.
L'immeuble s'est effondrť sur nous.
On dirait que
la cage d'escalier nous a protťgťes.
Oý est Six†?
Son corps est mort.
Non, pas encore.
Aide-moi.
Il aurait mieux valu
que l'explosion la tue.
On ne pourra rien faire contre
la douleur avant de l'avoir sortie d'ici.
Hť, Six.
Je peux prendre une traverse
et abrťger tes souffrances.
Je ne veux pas mourir
une nouvelle fois.
C'est ton choix.
Oý diable est-on†?
On doit Ítre dans le parking.
L'entrťe nord doit Ítre par lŗ.
Je vais commencer ŗ creuser.
Accroche-toi.
«a va aller.
- Il y a un survivant.
- Ouais.
Accroche-toi, mon pote.
On va te sortir de lŗ.
Il y a de l'air frais par lŗ.
Merci, j'ai bien cru y passer.
Putain d'humain. Il doit probablement
Ítre responsable de l'explosion.
De la rťsistance†? Pourquoi†?
Aucun intťrÍt militaire
ŗ frapper un cafť.
Mais les humains
ne respectent pas la vie comme nous.
Non†!
Je ne te laisserai pas le tuer.
Elle a raison.
- Ne le tue pas.
- Pourquoi pas†?
Pourquoi ne pas le tuer†?
Tu as dťjŗ tuť des milliards de gens.
HonnÍtement, tu crois qu'un de plus
pŤsera plus lourd sur ta conscience,
chose dont tu es dťnuťe,
n'est-ce pas†?
On devrait l'interroger.
Pour trouver ses complices.
D'accord.
Tu peux me l‚cher, Sharon.
C'est quoi Áa†?
On dirait une plaque
d'identitť de la flotte coloniale.
Thrace, Kara.
- Starbuck†?
- Elle ťtait sur Caprica il y a 2 semaines.
Elle s'est ťchappťe
avec l'aide d'une autre Sharon.
Si elle lui a donnť Áa,
c'est qu'il compte pour elle.
Comme c'est mignon.
Tu l'as dans la main.
Une vraie preuve physique de l'amour
d'une personne pour une autre.
Si seulement tu ressentais
cela pour nous.
Je l'ai ressenti.
Encore.
Je t'aime, Gaius.
Tu en as la preuve tangible†?
Je ne comprends pas.
Elle allait si bien.
Non, elle n'allait pas bien.
J'ai essayť de vous le dire.
Ses poumons ne se sont
jamais complŤtement dťveloppťs.
Elle est entrťe en dťtresse respiratoire,
nous n'avons pas pu l'intuber ŗ temps.
Nous l'avons perdue. Je suis dťsolť.
J'aurais dŻ Ítre lŗ.
Sharon.
…coute, tu avais perdu beaucoup de sang.
Vous l'avez assassinťe.
Sharon, viens.
Qui a donnť l'ordre†?
Adama†? La prťsidente†? Qui†?
Je ne tue pas les patients.
Nous avons fait tout notre possible
mais elle est morte
et il n'y a rien d'autre ŗ dire.
Je devrais pouvoir vous donner
les cendres dans quelques heures.
Assassin.
- Sharon†!
- CrŤve†!
- Vous Ítes tous des assassins†!
- Reculez†!
- Vous Ítes tous des assassins†!
- Faites-la sortir d'ici.
Rendez-moi mon bťbť†!
Tu les as laissťs tuer notre enfant.
Je suis tellement dťsolť.
J'ai essayť,
j'ai essayť du mieux que j'ai pu.
Dieu voulait que notre enfant survive.
Il voulait qu'elle dirige la prochaine
gťnťration des enfants de Dieu.
Il voulait que tu la protŤges.
Oui.
Tu as commis un pÍchť
monstrueux et impardonnable
et maintenant toi et ta misťrable race
allez subir la vengeance de Dieu.
Elle est tellement belle.
Je ne sais pas comment vous remercier.
Quand j'ai perdu mon bťbť, je ne savais
pas comment aller de l'avant.
Je suis content que Áa marche
pour vous et cette petite fille.
Je n'arrive pas ŗ croire que
quelqu'un ait abandonnť ce petit ange.
Maya, comprenez bien que cette adoption
doit absolument rester secrŤte.
La mŤre est officier sur le Pegasus
et doit rester anonyme
pour des raisons politiques
et religieuses.
Vous avez ma parole.
Maya,
Áa vous dťrange si
je vous rends visite de temps ŗ autre†?
Bien sŻr que non.
Bien.
Allez-y.
Merci.
Je sais combien cela a ťtť
horrible pour vous mais croyez-moi,
c'ťtait impťratif.
Tout ce que les Cylons savent,
c'est que cet enfant est mort.
C'est une trŤs trŤs bonne chose.
C'est Áa que tu cherches†?
Tu peux l'avoir, tiens.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais†?
Je lui facilite juste la t‚che.
Allez, je te donne de l'avance.
Je suis bien lŗ oý je suis.
Ils viennent pour nous.
Et pour toi.
Ils seront trŤs intťressťs par toi.
- Laisse-le tranquille.
- Sharon...
Tu ťtais un hťros des Cylons.
Maintenant, tu n'es qu'une machine
endommagťe qui croit Ítre humaine.
Mais tu n'es pas humaine, Sharon.
Et tu ne le seras jamais.
Ouais, au moins
je ne suis pas un assassin.
J'ai une conscience.
Et je connais la diffťrence
entre le Bien et le Mal.
Un assassin,
c'est exactement ce que tu es.
La vie est courte,
mais pas celle d'aprŤs.
Laisse ton cúur ŗ l'abandon
et ton ‚me sera emprisonnťe.
Je t'aime, Gaius.
Mon cúur et mon ‚me t'appartiennent.
Ils sont presque lŗ.
Tu sais pourquoi ils voulaient
que tu travailles avec Sharon†?
Pour que tu perdes la tÍte.
Ils vont t'archiver, chťrie,
tout comme ils vont archiver Sharon.
Nous sommes dangereuses.
- Quoi†?
- Sharon et moi.
Nous sommes des cťlťbritťs
dans une culture basťe sur l'unitť.
Non.
Nos voix comptent.
Plus que la sienne ou celle des autres.
Nous sommes
deux hťros des Cylons, non†?
Deux hťros avec des
points de vue diffťrents sur la guerre.
Points de vue basťs sur
notre amour pour deux Ítres humains.
Voilŗ pourquoi elle voulait
qu'on travaille ensemble,
pour que tu me dises
que Gaius vit toujours.
Elle voulait que je perde la tÍte.
Non, vous Ítes altťrťes
par vos expťriences.
Vous Ítes du gaspillage.
Crois aux mensonges.
Ignore la vťritť, ťcoute-moi,
je te montrerai la preuve.
Parle avec ton cúur.
Dis les choses que tu sais Ítre vraies.
La jalousie,
le meurtre, la vengeance
sont tous des pťchťs aux yeux de Dieu.
C'est ce que nous deux savons.
C'est ce qu'ils ne veulent pas entendre.
Parce qu'ils devraient alors
repenser ŗ ce qu'ils font.
Ils devraient envisager
que le massacre de l'humanitť
ťtait peut-Ítre une erreur.
Dieu m'aime.
A la prochaine.
On dirait qu'ils sont presque arrivťs.
Tu devrais t'en aller tant que tu peux.
Le courant d'air frais te conduira dehors.
C'est un piŤge†?
Tu peux rester et Ítre torturť,
si t'as envie.
C'est ton choix.
Qui Ítes-vous†?
Quel genre de personnes Ítes-vous†?
Je ne sais pas.
Attends†!
Combien de temps avant qu'elle se
transfŤre et qu'elle leur raconte tout†?
On ťtait nombreux dans le cafť.
Au moins 36 heures avant son tour.
- Assez de temps.
- Assez de temps pour quoi†?
Pour amťliorer les choses.
De quoi tu parles†?
Je n'ai jamais
autant aimť quelqu'un dans ma vie
que je t'aime maintenant.
Notre peuple a besoin
d'un nouveau dťpart.
Une nouvelle maniŤre
de vivre dans l'amour de Dieu.
Sans haine, sans tous les mensonges.
Ils ont juste besoin de quelqu'un
qui leur montre le chemin.
Quelqu'un comme
deux hťros des Cylons.
Je suis avec toi.
On les a trouvťes†!
- Elles sont vivantes.
- Oui, nous le sommes.
Nous sommes vivantes.
- =( Team Lords of Kobol )= -
LES CYLONS FURENT CRÉÉS PAR L'HOMME
ILS ÉVOLUÈRENT
ILS SE RÉVOLTÈRENT
IL Y A DE NOMBREUSES COPIES
ET ILS ONT UN PLAN.
Je vais perdre.
Oui, entrez.
- Une minute, Madame la Présidente.
- Merci, Tory.
Personne ne devrait se faire d'illusions
sur ce qu'on va affronter.
Notre dernier saut
nous mènera en basse atmosphère,
à moins de deux klicks de la surface.
On s'attend également
à subir un feu nourri.
Les simulations indiquent que nous
pouvons attendre jusqu'à 20% de pertes.
C'est pourquoi cette mission a été
classée Alpha-2 par le commandement.
Elle n'inclut que des volontaires.
Si vous voulez abandonner,
c'est le moment.
Je sais que c'est dur d'y croire
maintenant mais si tu as la foi,
tout se passera exactement
comme il se doit.
- Je n'aime pas perdre.
- Aie la foi.
Je suis sur le point de subir
une humiliation publique.
Et tu continues de seriner
la même rengaine.
Je suis fatigué de cette sérénade.
Désolée pour le fouillis, c'est un...
genre de rituel,
une superstition plutôt.
J'avais l'habitude de le faire avant
de témoigner aux commissions.
Ce que je fais, j'en prends une,
je mémorise le sujet,
puis je déchire la carte,
et je laisse les morceaux
tomber au hasard, ça aide.
Mon père avait l'habitude de
casser des crayons avant de plaider
puis il en empruntait un au greffier.
Briser les préjugés.
Faire avec ce qu'on a.
Vous savez,
j'aime beaucoup. Voyons voir.
J'adore.
- Ça fait du bien.
- Vous vous sentez mieux ?
Oui, mais qu'est-ce que je fais si...
- Alain Duhamel n'a pas de crayon ?
- Alors vous êtes cuite.
J'avais toujours le fou rire
avant les débats au lycée.
Oui.
- C'est l'heure, Madame la Présidente.
- Merci, Tory.
Vous êtes nombreux à ignorer
que le Raider cylon capturé
est capable de sauts
bien plus longs que nos Raptors.
Nous avons réalisé très tôt
que si nous pouvions installer
le système de navigation du Raider
à bord d'un de nos Raptors,
une équipe d'assaut pourrait
faire le voyage vers Caprica
en moins de dix sauts.
Jusqu'à maintenant, le facteur bloquant
était notre incapacité
à intégrer l'ordinateur cylon
avec le nôtre.
Nous avons désormais
surmonté cet obstacle.
Elle est ici pour nous aider.
Elle préparera notre plan de vol,
et mettra à jour nos points de saut.
Quelqu'un a un problème avec ça ?
Tu as été choisi pour guider ce peuple
par Dieu tout-puissant.
Cela arrivera.
Comme pour le bébé ?
Celui que j'étais destiné à protéger ?
Ne laisse pas ta colère
te conduire au blasphème, Gaius.
Les élections sont dans deux semaines.
Reprends-toi.
Vous êtes prêt ?
Oui, je faisais juste une sieste.
Chef ?
C'est notre mission.
Notre devoir envers
ceux qui sont restés derrière
et si nous devons utiliser un Cylon
pour les ramener, qu'il en soit ainsi.
Il s'agit d'essayer de ramener le
plus de survivants possible de Caprica.
Ça reste quand même
une mission Alpha-2.
Personne ne veut abandonner ?
Commandant sur le pont !
Pas d'inquiétude, je ne serai pas long.
Je veux aussi l'écouter.
Vous devez seulement essayer
de penser à quelque chose de grave.
Ça aide toujours.
- OK ?
- Comme quoi ?
Bien, comme...
Génial.
Personne n'a jamais tenté une mission
de secours de cette distance,
encore moins derrière
les lignes ennemies.
Vous entrerez dans l'Histoire
rien qu'en essayant.
Mais ramenez ces gens de Caprica...
et vous serez les artisans du futur.
Questions ?
Si vous trouvez la Terre avant notre
retour, gardez-nous quelques places.
La Terre ?
Putain, si on trouve un caillou
avec de l'eau et de la bouffe,
je vous construis un bar.
Très bien.
Je vous avais dit que je serais bref.
Monsieur Gaeta, allumez la radio.
Laissons-leur une chance
d'entrevoir le cirque
qu'ils vont louper
ces cinq prochains jours.
<i>Nous sommes à quelques instants
du premier débat présidentiel.</i>
<i>- entre la Présidente Laura Roslin...
- Ça va ?</i>
<i>et son adversaire
le Vice-président Gaius Baltar.</i>
Je peux y aller maintenant ?
<i>- Toutes les questions que je poserai
- Caporal.</i>
<i>ont été soumises par les civils de la
flotte et couvrent de nombreux domaines.</i>
<i>Restez avec nous alors que commence
le premier de deux débats présidentiels.</i>
<i>L'atmosphère dans l'amphithéâtre
est tendue</i>
<i>alors que nous attendons l'arrivée des
deux candidats et de leurs assistants.</i>
<i>Une véritable pression pèsera
sur le Vice-président Baltar ce soir.</i>
Chef ?
Et voici le Vice-Président,
Gaius Baltar, qui entre dans la salle,
alors que nous attendons
Madame la Présidente.
Laura Roslin est largement en tête
des sondages pour le moment.
Nous pensons que...
Il va rentrer sous peu mais...
il attend qu'elle arrive, bien sûr.
<i>Elle n'a rien vu venir à l'annonce
de sa candidature il y a un mois.</i>
<i>Dr. Baltar est bien entendu l'un des plus
admirés et brillants esprits scientifiques</i>
<i>de sa génération et a joué un rôle essentiel
dans la survie de la race humaine</i>
<i>contre la menace cylon.</i>
Oui, voilà maintenant la Présidente.
Laura Roslin, la Présidente,
vient d'entrer dans la salle.
Je vais vous faire mordre
la poussière, Gaius.
Vous devez encore perdre la tête.
Si c'est tout ce que vous avez trouvé,
vous êtes dans le pétrin.
Bonne chance.
Comment tu te sens ? Ça va ?
Sharon.
Ne m'ignore pas.
Pas maintenant.
Quelque chose de sinistre va arriver, Helo.
Je le sens.
Je le sens rodant autour de nous.
À l'affût.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
Sur Caprica ?
Non.
Pas la mission.
C'est pas quelque chose en particulier.
C'est plus comme un age sombre.
Chef ?
Chef.
À l'aide !

À LA RECHERCHE D'UN FOYER
APPELÉ LA TERRE
TERRE
Synchro :
Dapitch, Goufrach, Lovechange, NikoMagnus
Trad/Relect : Aspirant Nemo, Dapitch, Goufrach
Lama, Laulibrius, Nikomagnus, The Cole
Chef Tyrol,
je suis Frère Cavill.
Vous avez demandé un soutien religieux.
Je n'ai jamais cru à la psychothérapie.
Mon père était prêtre.
Je vois, vous pensiez être plus à l'aise
avec un prêtre qu'avec un vrai docteur.
Je prie les Dieux
chaque nuit.
Mais je ne pense pas
qu'ils m'écoutent.
Savez-vous à quel point...
la prière est inutile ?
Scander et chanter et...
perdre son temps avec de vilaines
strophes à demi oubliées.
Et vous savez ce qu'il arrive ?
Rien justement.
Vous êtes sûr d'être prêtre ?
Je prêchais déjà que vous ne
têtiez pas encore l'oxygène.
Et pendant tout ce temps, j'en ai
appris assez pour savoir que les Dieux
ne répondent pas aux prières.
Nous sommes livrés à notre sort.
C'est ainsi qu'Ils ont créé les choses.
Nous devons trouver
nos propres réponses,
notre propre route
à travers la jungle,
sans un joli petit chemin ensoleillé
tracé pour nous à l'avance.
C'est ce que j'essaie de faire.
J'essaie de trouver ma voie.
Ça n'ira pas tant que
vous ne cernerez pas le problème.
Et le problème est
que vous êtes dérangé.
De cœur et d'esprit.
Vous, pas les Dieux,
le destin ou l'univers.
Vous.
Merci pour le laïus d'encouragement.
- Salut.
- Salut.
Je voulais juste dire...
Bonne chasse.
Merci Monsieur.
Ouais, c'est un bon plan.
C'est un bon plan.
Sharon devrait vous faire sauter
dans l'atmosphère à quelques...
- klicks de la surface.
- Juste en dessous...
du dradis cylon.
Je connais le plan, Lee. Je l'ai conçu.
J'y vais.
J'espère que tu le trouveras, Kara.
Vraiment.
Moi aussi.
De la dépêche coloniale :
"Le débat de la nuit dernière a seulement
renforcé le sentiment que
"Docteur Baltar, malgré tout son charme,
est essentiellement une coquille vide
"quand il s'agit des
problèmes politiques importants."
C'est bien de voir que la presse
a raison pour une fois.
l'accusation de fanatisme religieux
est dangereuse,
C'est peut-être le coup bas
d'un homme désespéré mais
C'est le seul point dont il a pu tirer parti.
Il va continuer de l'exploiter.
Il va devoir trouver quelque chose
de bien, bien plus gros que ça
s'il veut en faire le point central
de sa campagne. Ça ne va pas marcher.
Vous devez continuer de la confronter
sur le côté religieux.
À chaque fois, vous marquez des points
et nous montons dans les sondages.
Je ne suis pas sûr que
vous soyez conscient, Tom,
mais la foule n'a pas l'habitude
d'élire des apostats athées
qui dénigrent les gens de foi.
Les choses sont en train de tourner,
vous verrez.
Il a raison.
Écoute-le.
Bien sûr.
Bien sûr, quel aveugle je suis.
Merci.
"Les choses sont en train de tourner,
vous verrez." C'est quoi ça, un conseil ?
Bien, merci.
Merci pour votre perspicacité aiguisée,
votre stupéfiante finesse politique .
Vous savez,
je suis si rassuré maintenant, Tom,
que je vais juste rester assis et
attendre que la Main de Dieu
descende et change mon sort politique.
Que dites-vous de ça ?
<i>Galactica, ici Starbuck.</i>
Escadron SAR confirme
la vérification des préparatifs.
Tout roule ici.
Parés pour le premier saut.
<i>Feu vert pour le saut, Starbuck.</i>
Bien reçu.
Saut dans 10 minutes, top.
Top.
Galactica, je voudrais parler à l'amiral.
Monsieur.
Ici l'amiral.
Vous ai-je déjà remercié ?
Non.
Quand bien même,
ce serait une première, non ?
Merci.
<i>Reviens en un seul morceau.</i>
Cela me suffira.
Bonne chasse.
Terminé.
Équipe de secours, ici Starbuck.
Entrez les coordonnées pour vérification.
Attendez les réponses,
et la stabilisation inertielle.
Faisons une dernière vérification.
<i>Headcase : OK.</i>
<i>Sourceman : OK.</i>
Je n'en reviens pas que
tu m'aies entraînée là-dedans.
C'est important.
<i>Stumble : OK.</i>
Je serai avec toi tout le long.
À partir d'ici, c'est toi et moi.
Peu importe le reste.
Comme convenu.
Je sais, je sais.
J'apprécie Helo, vraiment.
<i>Julian : OK.</i>
<i>Becker : OK.</i>
Je n'arrive pas à la sortir de mon esprit.
Notre petite fille.
Y a un problème ?
<i>- Racetrack: OK.
- Challenge : OK.</i>
<i>Vérif. radio terminée.</i>
Les voyants sont au vert,
et nous sommes prêts.
Sharon, c'est à toi.
Prête.
Équipe de secours, ici Starbuck.
Tenez-vous prêts
à sauter à mon signal.
Cinq.
<i>- On y est.
- Quatre.</i>
<i>Trois.</i>
Deux.
Un.
Initiez le premier saut.
Quelque chose cloche.
- Aucun contact dradis.
- Quoi ?
On n'est pas aux bonnes
coordonnées de saut.
Frack.
Helo, on a déjà
perdu quelqu'un.
C'est Racetrack.
On fait demi-tour ?
Les ordres sont de
continuer à moins d'en perdre trois.
Donc on continue.
Racetrack devra trouver
son chemin jusqu'à la maison.
Sacrée manière de commencer, non ?
Parlons de ce qui s'est passé.
Je ne peux vraiment pas y croire.
Cally ? Je ne peux pas
comprendre comment j'ai pu faire ça
à Cally. Ça ressemblait à un cauchemar
Elle a dit que vous dormiez
lorsqu'elle vous a trouvé.
Faisiez-vous un cauchemar
quand elle vous a réveillé ?
Je ne m'en souviens pas.
Avez-vous des rêves récurrents
ces derniers temps ?
Non.
Bien.
Ça c'est ce que, dans la prêtrise,
nous appelons un mensonge.
Et les mensonges ne
vous mèneront à rien, mon ami.
Donc oubliez les dénégations
et les mensonges
et allons droit au but,
voulez-vous ?
Vous faites des rêves.
Quels sont-ils ?
Racontez-moi votre rêve, Chef.
Toutes les nuits...
c'est la même chose.
Depuis combien de temps ?
Environ deux semaines.
Et vous faisiez ce même rêve
lorsque Cally vous a réveillé, non ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je ne sais plus. Peut-être.
Ça n'a pas d'importance, si ?
Tout ce dont je me souviens,
c'est de Cally
étendue sur le sol. Et le sang.
Elle vous a arrêté.
En vous réveillant,
elle vous a empêché de concrétiser
vos pulsions suicidaires cachées.
J'ai pas de pulsions suicidaires cachées.
Vous avez raison.
Elles ne sont pas cachées.
Vous voulez visiblement vous suicider.
La question est pourquoi.
Je pense qu'il y a eu un bug
dans le système de navigation.
Au final, on est vachement
loin de l'endroit prévu, chef.
Bon, on a quand même
une chance de les rejoindre ?
Aucune.
Les ordres
nous obligent à rentrer.
Et Frack !
C'était le premier saut !
- Vous m'avez donné les coordonnées
- Oui, je...
Retour au bercail.
Je détecte un grand corps planétaire.
Tout proche, putain.
D'où ça sort, ça ?
Comment je saurais ?
Il y a tellement d'interférences dradis
que je ne l'avais pas vu.
Regardez-ça.
Atmosphère à base
d'azote et d'oxygène.
Présence de composés organiques.
Eau douce ?
Vous savez ce que ça veut dire ?
C'est habitable.
On vient peut-être de trouver
un monde adapté à la vie humaine.
On est peut-être pas
une bande de losers après tout.
Les relevés climatiques d'ensemble
sont dans les normes humaines.
Quelques extrêmes aux pôles
que l'on ne pourrait supporter
mais ce n'est pas inhabituel.
- Bien joué.
- Merci, Monsieur.
Il y a une zone marbrée ici
à l'embouchure de la rivière.
C'est donc probablement un delta.
Il y a des chances qu'on y trouve
des plantes et de la vie animale.
Alors je veux beaucoup
de passages bas à cet endroit.
On dit que la mission de reconnaissance
du Pegasus a trouvé de la vie.
Des arbres fruitiers.
Des rivières de lait et de miel.
Ouais. Tu oublies les lacs d'ambroisie.
En fait, une grande partie
de la planète est plutôt aride.
La faune et la flore sont concentrées dans
une région tempérée autour de l'équateur.
Mais la cerise sur le gâteau, c'est que
avec toutes les interférences sur
le Dradis provoquées par la nébuleuse
les Cylons ne la trouveront
probablement jamais.
Qui s'intéresse à cette stupide
planète de toute façon ?
Toutes ces histoires pour rien.
Moins de 20% de cet endroit
est vraiment hospitalier alors...
Tu ne vois pas à long terme.
C'est votre nouveau foyer.
L'endroit où vous mènerez
une nouvelle vie. C'est le futur, Gaius.
Là, je ne suis pas de cet avis.
- Pardon ?
- Rien, Tom.
Seulement...
Vous imaginez si nous devions
vraiment vivre sur cette chose ?
Vous...
êtes un génie.
Et ?
Concentre-toi. Tu es sur le point
de gagner les élections.
- Désolé. Que disiez-vous, Tom ?
- Nous avions besoin d'une confrontation.
Quelque chose qui
nous distingue de Roslin.
Qui la place clairement du mauvais
côté dans une question cruciale
qui préoccupe ardemment les gens.
C'est ça.
S'établir définitivement
sur cette planète.
S'établir définitivement ici.
Vous avez perdu la tête ?
Elle peut paraître morne,
elle est peut-être morne,
mais c'est de la terre ferme sous vos pieds
et un vrai ciel au-dessus de votre tête.
Vous seriez surpris à quel point
l'idée est tentante pour des gens
coincés dans des boîtes
en métal pendant neuf mois.
Tu devrais l'écouter, Gaius.
C'est un homme intelligent
et séduisant, tout comme toi.
Laisse tomber.
Pardon ?
Laisser tomber la Terre.
Oui.
Pour s'installer ici.
Oui.
Vous savez, ça finit par ressembler à
une charmante petite planète après tout.
C'est une aire de repos.
Pour faire le plein de nourriture et d'eau.
Nous ne nous fixerons pas ici, évidemment.
D'après les rapports du capitaine,
dans toute la flotte, des gens
quémandent, implorent, exigent
de descendre à la surface.
Ne serait-ce que pour quelques heures.
Quelques heures c'est une chose.
S'installer définitivement en est une autre.
Subitement Baltar fait miroiter l'espoir
de respirer l'air naturel,
de cultiver la nourriture, de dormir
dans un lit et pas une couchette.
De vivre dans une maison
et pas dans un vaisseau.
C'est un fantasme.
Regardez les rapports de mission.
Toutes les données indiquent que la vie
sur cette planète serait difficile.
Ce serait une lutte quotidienne
pour vivoter quelques années.
Les sondages d'aujourd'hui montrent qu'il
remonte grâce à l'idée que parce que
la planète est cachée dans une nébuleuse,
elle fournira un abri contre les Cylons.
Est-ce qu'on présume maintenant
que la technologie cylon
n'est pas suffisante pour trouver
cette planète ? Nous l'avons trouvée.
Madame, à mon avis, leurs votes
sont motivés par leurs espoirs,
pas par leurs peurs.
Baltar leur offre ce
qu'ils veulent entendre,
et vous, une réalité bien plus pénible.
- Je leur offre la vérité.
- Ils ne veulent pas entendre la vérité.
Ils sont fatigués, épuisés.
L'idée de s'arrêter,
de poser leur fardeau,
et de commencer une nouvelle vie,
c'est ce qui fait vibrer les électeurs.
Jusqu'à quel point ?
Cela pourrait faire basculer le scrutin.
Pourquoi fuyez-vous ?
- Je ne fuis pas.
- Combien de temps allez-vous faire ça ?
Combien de temps allez-vous refuser
de voir ce qui est sous votre nez ?
Laissez tomber. J'ai terminé.
Comment, vous partez ?
Tout à fait. J'en ai fini.
fini de tourner autour
du pot avec vous.
Vous savez ce qu'il en est.
Mais vous ne pouvez pas ou
ne voulez pas l'affronter, alors...
Je ne suis pas thérapeute.
Je ne vous prendrai pas
par la main pour vous faire avancer.
J'essaye de vous réconcilier avec
vous-même et avec vos Dieux,
mais vous n'avez pas
la volonté de le faire.
Je ne sais même pas
de quoi vous parlez.
Pour l'amour des Dieux, Chef ! Allez !
Vous croyez être un Cylon.
Je ne suis pas un Cylon.
Bien sûr que non.
Mais c'est ce que vous craignez, non ?
Que vous puissiez être un Cylon sans
même le savoir, comme Boomer, c'est ça ?
C'est bien ça ?
C'est la pensée qui hante
vos rêves et torture votre âme.
"Je suis un Cylon, comme Sharon,
"et je mérite la mort."
Sharon ne savait pas
ce qu'elle était.
Elle n'arrêtait pas
de penser, de sentir
qu'elle allait faire une chose horrible.
Mais elle savait qu'elle devait
s'arrêter avant de le faire.
Et vous pensez que c'est ce que vous
allez faire. Quelque chose d'horrible.
En vérité, c'est possible.
Pas parce que vous êtes un Cylon.
Parce que vous êtes humain, et les humains
font des choses horribles tout le temps.
Mais comment savez-vous
que je suis humain ?
Peut-être parce que je suis un Cylon,
et que je ne vous ai jamais
rencontré dans aucune réunion.
Je ne peux rien faire de plus pour vous.
Vous allez devoir retourner au travail
et essayer de laisser
tout ça derrière vous.
Non. Je...
Je ne peux pas.
Je ne peux plus retourner
affronter le personnel de pont.
Et Cally ?
Il vaudrait mieux pour vous.
C'est la seule famille que vous ayez.
Sachez seulement que c'est
votre famille et qu'ils vous aiment.
Même Cally. En particulier Cally.
Si vous doutez de votre humanité,
de votre nature profonde d'être humain,
tournez-vous vers eux pour le salut
que vous cherchez auprès des Dieux.
Les Dieux aident
ceux qui s'entraident, Chef.
Équipe de sauvetage, ici Starbuck.
Nous y sommes.
En attente pour le dernier saut vers Caprica.
Nous arriverons très près de la surface.
Préparez-vous à beaucoup
de vent, de la pluie, des orages...
à n'importe quoi.
<i>Bien reçu, Starbuck.</i>
Prête ?
Prête.
On y va.
Saut.
Équipe de sauvetage, ici Starbuck.
En formation derrière moi.
<i>Bien reçu, chef.</i>
Aucun Cylon, Helo ?
Rien sur le Dradis.
Attends un peu, attends un peu.
Il manque un Raptor.
Je n'en vois que 17. Il nous manque
le Raptor 6-12.
C'est Toughguy et Carousel.
Ils ont sauté à de mauvaises coordonnées ?
Non.
Non, non. Je capte
leur transpondeur, donc ils ont réussi.
Azimut 827, élévation de 443.
À peu près un demi klick d'ici.
Ça les placerait...
Oh, Dieux...
Où ça Helo ?
Parle-moi.
Ils ont sauté dans la montagne.
Merde.
Équipe de sauvetage, ici Starbuck.
On a perdu le Raptor 6-12.
On continue sans eux.
Suivez-moi.
<i>Bien reçu, Starbuck.</i>
<i>Je pense que ma position</i>
<i> ainsi que le positionnement
de ma campagne est très clair.</i>
Madame la Présidente,
vous avez 30 secondes pour répondre.
Ma première réponse est :
"Voilà qu'il recommence."
Encore une fois,
mesdames et messieurs, le Docteur Baltar
détourne les vrais problèmes.
Le problème ou
la vraie question ici, n'est pas
de permettre les Écritures dicter
la politique du gouvernement.
La question est : "Les Écritures
offrent-elles un intérêt concret ?"
Contiennent-elles
les informations nécessaires
pour nous guider
vers un foyer plus sûr
qu'une planète complètement inconnue
que nous venons de découvrir ?
Évidemment, ma réponse
à cette question est oui.
J'ai toujours pensé
et je continuerai à penser,
que les Écritures
s'appliquent au monde réel.
M. le Vice-Président,
la prochaine question est pour vous.
Que répondez-vous aux accusations
d'avoir adhéré à l'installation permanente
sur cette planète par opportunisme.
Certains disent ou l'interprètent
comme une tactique désespérée d'une campagne
tenue en échec dans tous les sondages.
Et bien, vous savez que...
C'est une très bonne question.
En fait, Jim, merci.
Et je suis très content
d'avoir l'occasion d'y répondre.
Vous voyez, j'ai longtemps été
adepte de la recherche de la Terre.
L'éventualité de trouver
non seulement un nouveau foyer,
mais aussi la perspective de découvrir
nos frères et sœurs perdus
de la 13ème Colonie, est très tentante.
Et j'y ai cru corps et âme.
Mais le problème c'est que,
les Cylons nous suivent toujours,
chaque fois que nous nous déplaçons
depuis la destruction des Colonies.
Et si nous avons une chance
de changer cette dynamique,
d'arrêter cette poursuite mortelle,
ne devrions-nous pas la saisir ?
Ma réponse est oui.
Merci.
Madame la Présidente, 30 secondes.
Il n'y a aucune certitude,
absolument aucune
que les Cylons
ne connaissent pas cette planète.
Qu'ils n'y font pas
régulièrement arrêt en nous cherchant,
et qu'en fait,
ils n'attendent pas tout simplement
que nous nous y installions.
- Alors ils...
- Je dois répondre à ça.
Je dois vraiment répondre à ça.
Vous avez 15 secondes.
Ce que vous venez de voir, mesdames
et messieurs, est un nouvel exemple
de la Présidente utilisant la peur
comme moteur de la campagne.
La peur.
La peur des Dieux.
La peur du Cylon,
la peur de la peur elle-même.
N'est-il pas temps d'arrêter d'avoir peur ?
Je demande que tous, nous
arrêtions de fuir nos propres vies
et de commencer à les vivre.
Merci.
Merci, le temps imparti pour aujourd'hui
est terminé. J'aimerais remercier
les candidats pour leur franchise
aujourd'hui. Un débat vraiment passionnant.
Cela conclut le cycle
des débats pour la présidence.
Le scrutin s'ouvrira dans trois jours.
S'il vous plaît, votez.
Merci et bonne nuit.
- Pas votre soirée, j'imagine.
- Allez donc vous faire foutre.
<i>Avec moi maintenant,
le directeur de la campagne du Dr. Baltar.</i>
<i>Monsieur Tom Zarek. Tom, bienvenue.</i>
<i>Vous étiez avec nous aujourd'hui.
Quelles sont vos impressions ?</i>
<i>Et bien je...</i>
<i>pense que le Dr. Baltar a été exceptionnel.</i>
<i>Il a décrit sa vision du futur et
a offert aux gens un moyen d'arrêter</i>
<i>la souffrance et la terreur
qui déterminent tellement leurs vies.</i>
<i>D'un autre côté, je me demande comment</i>
<i>les arguments de Roslin
contre l'installation pourraient gagner.</i>
CAPRICA - OCCUPATION CYLON
Voyons où on est, Karl.
Le camp de la résistance.
On est encore...
à un klick.
Mouvement à 11h.
Amis ?
Est-ce qu'il y a un Samuel T. Anders ici ?
Y a une Kara Thrace ici ?
Si oui,
dites-lui qu'elle a
bien pris son temps pour revenir.
Amis.
Pourquoi t'as mis si longtemps ?
On a des Marines dans des Raptors.
On va te sortir d'ici,
toi et tes hommes, OK ?
C'est ce que t'avais promis, hein ?
Ouais, ma putain de promesse.
Quoi, tu croyais
que j'allais te laisser ici ?
Maintenant t'as l'air con, hein ?
D'accord, tais-toi et sauve-nous, OK ?
Messieurs, c'est chouette
mais on a des toasteurs au cul.
Où est le reste de tes hommes ?
C'est tout.
Les toasteurs ont
attaqué notre camp ce matin.
J'ai perdu la moitié de mon équipe.
En approche !
Tous aux Raptors !
Non !
Il y a un tir de barrage entre nous
et les Raptors. On est isolés !
À SUIVRE...
CAPRICA SOUS OCCUPATION CYLON
Ils se dirigent droit vers nous. Si on
reste ici, ils vont nous écrabouiller.
Bien, on se replie.
Direction la colline. Allez !
On y va, les gars !
La mâchoire est bien remise.
On en a fini.
Je vous vire d'ici et
vous renvoie au boulot.
Bosser comme ça ?
J'admire une femme qui peut se plaindre
même la bouche à moitié cousue.
Vous avez de la visite.
Je suis désolé.
Ce que j'ai fait, était...
Impardonnable.
Inexcusable.
- Je ne suis pas venu...
- Je vous pardonne.
Non, Cally, non.
Ce n'était pas vous.
Je le sais.
Ce n'était pas vous.
C'était moi. Je...
Je n'avais plus toute ma tête,
je ne savais plus où...
ce que je faisais,
mais c'était bien moi.
Vous souffrez.
Vous souffrez depuis pas mal de temps.
Ne sois pas navrée pour moi.
Je tiens à vous.
Depuis toujours.
Et pour toujours.
Allez, allez !
- On se bouge !
- Allez, on se relève !
- Relevez-le, relevez-le !
- Bougez-vous !
Allez !
Allez, allez !
Rentrez là-dedans !
Montez-le, vite !
Sharon, prends le pistolet.
Munitions !
Ils nous ont bloqués ici en beauté !
Merde !
Les Raptors sont injoignables.
Les Cylons brouillent les fréquences.
Merde.
Ils sont encore là ?
Attention à toi.
Oui...
Mais ils restent en arrière.
Oui, mais pourquoi ?
Ils gardent leur position.
En attendant des armes non mortelles.
Pour avoir des prisonniers à interroger.
Et envoyer le reste à la ferme.
Je retournerai pas
dans une de leurs fermes.
T'auras pas vraiment le choix.
Aucun de nous.
Ils vont balancer un gaz quelconque ici
et on va tous se réveiller ailleurs.
- Merde.
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux faire ?
On reste ici.
Voir si elle a raison.
Si c'est le cas, alors toi et moi,
on doit se faire une promesse.
Une promesse ?
De ne pas retourner
dans une de ces fermes, Sam.
J'y retournerai pas.
Donc si elle a raison,
et qu'ils balancent du gaz...
Tu t'occupes de moi et moi de toi.
De quoi tu parles ?
Voilà de quoi je parle, OK ?
Oui, d'accord.
Bien.
Encore deux points de moins. Et ce après
son discours sur la politique sociale.
Sans même parler ce fantasme
qu'il appelle "politique de sécurité."
Les gens seront-ils
à ce point stupides ?
Seront-ils aussi peu avisés ?
Il profite du seul sujet
qui intéresse le public.
Je sais, la planète. Tout le monde ne fait
que parler de cette foutue planète.
Pardonnez mon...
mon langage, Tory. Désolée.
Je sais dans mes tripes
que s'installer sur cette planète est
synonyme de désastre pour l'humanité.
Je ne me renierai pas
pour gagner une élection.
Comme vous voudrez,
Madame la Présidente.
Je suppose que
je devrais faire mes cartons
à moins que vous ayez un plan de secours
ultrasecret pour remporter la victoire.
Il y a toujours un plan de secours...
pour la victoire.
Le prêtre doit être là.
Bien, faites-le entrer.
18 heures.
Ils prennent du bon temps là-bas.
Ils auraient pu nous écraser
n'importe quand durant la nuit.
Ils mijotent quelque chose.
Et nous ?
Une idée brillante
dans ton cerveau de militaire ?
Faire ce qu'on fait toujours.
Les combattre jusqu'au bout.
Tu penses à quoi ?
Formons une mission de reconnaissance.
Pour explorer le secteur.
Voir ce qu'il se trame.
Ils ne sont plus là.
Ils sont partis.
Remercions les Dieux.
C'est un miracle.
Prions.
Dieux de Kobol,
nous croyons en votre bienveillance,
et louons votre vertu.
Donnez au peuple de cette flotte
la sagesse de voir la bonté
et la force de votre servante,
Laura Roslin.
Amen.
Amiral ?
Madame la Présidente.
L'Amiral n'est pas là.
C'est une réunion avec moi.
Je voulais vous parler en privé
sans que la presse en ait vent.
Asseyez-vous je vous prie.
Vous devez avoir quelque chose de
très intéressant à dire pour utiliser...
une tromperie aussi vulgaire.
La question de l'établissement permanent
est sans doute le sujet
le plus important depuis l'attaque.
Je suis d'accord.
Bien.
La question doit être sérieusement étudiée
avant de prendre une décision définitive.
En pleine campagne électorale,
c'est rarement le moment
pour un examen scrupuleux.
C'est pourquoi je propose une trêve.
Vous et moi allons faire
une déclaration commune annonçant
que cette question
sera débattue après l'élection.
Nous jurerons tous deux
qu'indépendamment de l'issue du scrutin,
la décision ne sera prise
qu'après des débats approfondis
faisant intervenir
l'ensemble de l'opinion
et après consultation des militaires
et du Quorum des Douze.
Docteur,
Je sais que nous avons
eu des désaccords.
mais ce problème
transcende aussi bien les divergences
personnelles que politiques.
J'en appelle maintenant
à votre patriotisme.
Laissez-moi vous dire
que mon patriotisme se porte très bien.
Merci beaucoup de vous en soucier.
Je considère comme
mon devoir patriotique
de guider cette flotte
vers un nouveau monde.
Ce nouveau monde est
incontestablement New Caprica.
Mais merci, Madame la Présidente,
de me prouver
à quel point votre campagne
de réélection est désespérée.
Étiez-vous avec une femme blonde
sur Caprica juste avant l'attaque ?
- Une quoi ?
- Elle sait.
Étiez-vous
avec une grande
femme blonde
sur la promenade
des quais de Caprica City
juste avant l'attaque ?
Elle voit clair dans ton jeu.
Sors d'ici maintenant.
A ce stade, vous vous servez
de tout, n'est-ce pas ?
Je crains que mes affaires sur Caprica
tout comme mes fréquentations
ne soient pas vos affaires.
Je vous ai sauvé la vie.
Je ne sauverai pas
votre carrière politique.
- On ne descendra pas sur cette planète.
- Si Baltar gagne cette élection...
- Il ne gagnera pas...
- S'il gagne, alors quoi ?
On croupira dans ce vaisseau pendant
que tous les autres commenceront
- une nouvelle vie ?
- Mon boulot est de protéger la flotte
des Cylons et c'est ce que je ferai.
Si tu veux t'installer là bas, vas-y
ne te gêne pas. Descends et minaude avec
tous les hommes. Accorde-toi du bon temps.
Saul,
C'est toi que je veux.
XO.
C'est une blague !
J'arrive de suite.
Starbuck est de retour.
Je dois descendre.
- On y est presque.
- Les gars,
Allez-y doucement avec ça. Allez.
Je suis douée ou pas ?
On n'aura plus de répit
avec elle maintenant.
Content de vous voir, bienvenue.
Merci, Monsieur.
Je vous ai ramené quelques amis.
Je vois.
Ok, bon.
C'est...
- C'est Samuel T. Anders.
- Je sais qui c'est.
- Très heureux de vous rencontrer.
- Caprica Buccaneers.
- C'est bien ça.
- Un joueur du tonnerre.
Je suis moi-même fan des Picon Panther.
Nous aussi on a bien aimé les battre.
- Content de vous avoir à bord.
- Merci.
J'ai des nouvelles,
de bonnes nouvelles, en fait.
L'occupation Cylon est terminée.
Ils sont partis, disparus.
- Qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?
- C'est la vérité.
Les Cylons ont quitté les Colonies.
Ils cherchent une herbe plus verte.
- Gardes !
- Qu'est-ce que c'est que cette merde ?
Ne bougez pas !
C'est un Cylon.
Reculez, Chef, on le tient.
Eh bien, c'est une
situation embarrassante.
Oui, il a raison, je suis un Cylon.
Et j'ai un message.
Donc...
Emmenez-moi à votre dirigeant.
Mettez-le en cellule.
- Celle-là aussi, en cellule.
- Quoi ?
- Amiral, elle ne savait pas.
- N'essayez même pas !
Bien sûr qu'elle savait.
Bienvenue sur le Galactica.
<i>Putain, pourquoi t'as rien dit ?</i>
Je ne sais pas.
Peut-être que je ne voulais pas.
<i>J'avais peut-être envie qu'il vienne
et qu'il fasse sauter le vaisseau.</i>
<i>C'est ça que tu veux entendre ?</i>
<i>Tu ne le penses pas.</i>
Sharon,
l'Amiral commençait enfin
à nous faire confiance. Enfin !
<i>Et quoi ?</i>
<i>Ils ont tué mon bébé.</i>
<i>Tu crois que je me soucie de toi,</i>
<i>de nous ou bien que l'Amiral
ait confiance en moi après ça ?</i>
Sharon !
Je t'aime et putain,
je ne renoncerai pas si facilement.
Pas après tout ça.
T'es prête ?
- Non, non, non.
- Si, si, si.
Écoute, t'as pas besoin de
me soûler, je coucherai avec toi, ok ?
Je suppose que je te dois bien ça
vu que tu m'as sauvé et tout ça.
- Petite salope.
- Ta gueule.
Et là tu te fait désirer.
Mon héros.
Bons dieux, on laisse vraiment entrer
n'importe qui ici en ce moment.
- Bienvenue.
- Tu veux rencontrer mon homme ?
Ton homme.
Mon bien personnel.
- Pas vrai, Sammy ?
- Ne m'appelle pas Sammy.
- Quel effet ça fait d'être ma chose.
- Ouais, c'est ça !
Et avant de répondre...
Ça va bien, je te remercie.
Me dis pas que
tu baises toujours Dualla, si ?
- Merci bien.
- Je veux dire, je ne suis pas du genre
à sermonner ou quoi
car je ferai n'importe quoi
pour fouiller le caleçon
d'un beau morceau de chair fraîche.
C'est tout ce que je suis pour toi ?
- Oui, mais t'aimes ça.
- C'est pas grave.
Ça ne me gêne pas de faire du social.
Il est parti où ?
Je suis là pour délivrer un message.
Apres cela, vous pourrez
faire de moi ce que vous voudrez.
Je m'en fiche.
Ça vous gênerait
de me dire ce qui se passe ?
Je ne suis pas un putain
de Cylon, je ne suis pas...
Bon.
D'accord alors...
Désolé de ruiner ta journée, mon frère,
mais il y a un changement de plan.
Il a été décidé
que l'occupation des
Colonies était une erreur.
J'aurais pu leur dire.
Mauvais raisonnement, logique douteuse.
Notre première grosse
erreur de jugement.
Vivre c'est apprendre.
Mais nos héros de guerre ont réussi
à faire basculer l'opinion de leur coté.
Quels héros ?
Une Six et une Huit.
Une Huit que vous connaissez,
Sharon Valerii.
Leur avis a beaucoup de poids.
Donc quand elles ont commencé à parler
de nos erreurs, de notre corruption
et de notre besoin d'un nouveau départ,
- le reste d'entre nous les a écoutées.
- Vous voyez, nous ne sommes pas comme vous.
Nous pouvons admettre nos erreurs
et nous n'avons pas peur du changement.
Vous avez donc quitté les Colonies
en laissant derrière vous
un désert nucléaire dévasté.
Et on devrait être reconnaissants.
La traque de votre flotte
était une autre erreur.
Ça fait deux
pour ceux qui comptent les points.
Ces deux erreurs
ont conduit au même résultat.
Nous sommes devenus ce
que nous avions sous les yeux.
Nous sommes devenus vous.
Amen.
Tout le monde devrait
assumer sa vraie nature.
Nous sommes des machines,
nous devrions être fidèles à cela.
Être les meilleures machines
que l'univers ait jamais portées.
Mais nous nous sommes mis en tête que
nous étions les enfants de l'humanité.
Donc au lieu de suivre notre destinée
et de suivre notre propre
chemin vers l'illumination,
- nous nous sommes emparés du votre.
- Bien dit, mon frère.
Ma mission ici est simple.
Je suis là pour vous dire
que nous vous offrons un sursis.
Les Cylons et les Hommes
suivront désormais des chemins séparés.
Sans rancune.
Sans rancune ?
Vous avez totalement annihilé notre race
et détruit notre civilisation.
Si on commence à se rejeter la faute...
Où les Cylons sont-ils allés ?
Sur leur monde ?
Je préfère
ne pas le dire pour l'instant.
Disons que nous avons d'autres plans.
Une nouvelle feuille de route
de votre unique vrai Dieu ?
Il n'y a pas de Dieu.
Les divinités surnaturelles
sont une réponse primitive
à la disparition
du soleil chaque nuit.
Du moins c'est ce que nous avons
répété aux autres pendant des années.
Bien sûr, il n'y a aucun moyen
de prouver l'un ou l'autre.
Je sais comment le prouver.
Jetez-les tous les deux par un sas, qu'ils
découvrent s'il y a vraiment un Dieu cylon.
JOUR DES ÉLECTIONS
Les votes de l'Adriatic, D. ?
Très bien, par ici.
Cette journée a été trépidante.
Cette élection fut un vrai
tour de montagnes russes.
Le scrutin est maintenant
clos depuis cinq heures.
Les résultats arrivent et font pencher
la balance d'un coté et de l'autre
<i>entre les candidats
pendant toute la nuit, comme prévu.</i>
<i>Nous attendons toujours
certains chiffres à venir,</i>
<i>provenant du bureau central
du Galactica, qui</i>
<i>je dois le dire et comme certains le savent,
a été l'objet d'une polémique hier.</i>
<i>Le Conseiller Zarek a déposé
une protestation officielle contre</i>
<i>l'emploi, la participation des militaires
dans le processus électoral.</i>
<i>Un compromis a finalement abouti</i>
<i>dans la nuit d'hier, permettant au
Galactica d'assurer la sécurité des urnes</i>
<i>au côté de civils supervisant
et contrôlant la situation.</i>
<i>Oui, très bien. Nous recevons de
nouveaux résultats.</i>
<i>Ce n'est pas fini. Mais il y a ici
6 282 voix supplémentaires pour Baltar</i>
<i>ce qui porte son total à</i>
21 569.
C'est juste ? Nous avons aussi
maintenant pour Roslin un total de
17 754.
<i>Nous avons 2 981 voix de plus</i>
<i>qui arrivent maintenant pour Roslin.</i>
<i>Voila l'état de la
situation à cette heure.</i>
<i>Nous vous tiendrons au courant
du décompte minute par minute.</i>
Oui, c'est moi.
La ligne est sécurisée ?
OK.
Il n'y a plus que
cinq vaisseaux à décompter.
Nous devons agir maintenant.
Je m'en occupe.
Lieutenant.
Je reviens tout de suite.
- Ce sont les urnes du Zephyr ?
- Oui, Madame.
Très bien, on s'en charge.
Nous devons les amener au dépouillement.
Le décompte a déjà commencé.
Nous les prenons en charge.
La dernière.
<i>Des résultats supplémentaires
nous parviennent à l'instant.</i>
8 593 voix pour Roslin,
ce qui lui fait prendre la tête.
<i>Cela fait 24 265 pour Laura Roslin.</i>
<i>Pas d'erreur ?</i>
<i>et 22 366 pour Gaius Baltar.</i>
<i>Nous allons vérifier ces chiffres car
cela la place en tête. Elle a réussi.</i>
<i>Elle conserve la présidence
en faisant un retour incroyable</i>
<i>dans les dernières heures de campagne.</i>
Encore une fois, nous vérifierons
bien entendu ces chiffres, si possible.
Mais il semble que Laura Roslin
conserve la présidence
<i>donnant tort aux sondages, spécialistes
et autres experts catastrophistes.</i>
<i>Je n'ai jamais vu de scrutin finir comme
cela, c'est pourtant ce qui arrive.</i>
<i>Ici James McManus.</i>
<i>Nous vérifierons ces chiffres et
nous nous retrouverons très vite. Merci.</i>
J'ai vu beaucoup d'élections, Gaius.
La plupart honnêtes,
quelques unes truquées.
Et on peut toujours dire lesquelles sont
arrangées car elles n'ont aucun sens.
Et celle-là n'a aucun sens.
Laura Roslin est bien des choses.
Mais elle n'est pas corrompue.
Et elle n'est pas malhonnête.
C'est terminé.
Félicitations, Madame la Présidente.
Merci.
J'espère que vous
ne le prendrez pas mal, mais
Êtes-vous aussi surpris que moi ?
Je suis soulagée.
<i>Vous n'en avez pas l'air.</i>
Je suis juste fatiguée.
La campagne a été longue.
Colonel, puis-je
vous parler un instant ?
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Monsieur, je crains qu'il n'ait un
problème avec ces bulletins du Zephyr.
De quoi parlez-vous ?
Le nom du Docteur Baltar y est
correctement orthographié.
Mais le Zephyr m'a appelé ce matin.
Et m'ont dit que les bulletins avaient une
coquille, une faute sur le prénom de Baltar.
On n'avait plus le temps
d'en imprimer de nouveaux donc
j'ai pris la responsabilité d'autoriser
quand même leur utilisation.
Le prénom de Baltar
est ici bien orthographié,
Ils ne peuvent donc pas
venir du Zephyr, ils sont faux.
Il y a tout une chaîne de surveillants
du Zephyr jusqu'a cette salle.
Un des intermédiaires est soit
coupable ou au moins complice....
Merci de me l'avoir signalé,
je m'en occupe à partir de maintenant.
Monsieur.
On devrait au moins signaler aux experts
civils et à la presse que ces bulletins...
J'ai dit que je m'en occuperai.
Oui, Monsieur.
Madame vous devriez fêter cela.
<i>C'est une grande victoire,
vous l'avez méritée.</i>
Excusez-moi.
<i>Nous parlerons plus tard, Amiral, merci.</i>
<i>- Ici Adama.
- Monsieur, c'est le lieutenant Gaeta.</i>
Monsieur,
<i>- Je ne sais pas comment le dire.
- Je vous conseille rapide et direct.</i>
<i>Oui, Monsieur.</i>
Amiral, je crois que le colonel Tigh
est impliqué dans une conspiration
visant à donner la victoire
à la Présidente Roslin.
Lorsque j'ai questionné le colonel,
il a admis sa culpabilité.
Il dit avoir agi avec
la complicité de votre
directrice de campagne, Tory Foster.
Saul a dit que Tory l'avait
contacté il y a quelques jours.
Il l'a fait car il pensait que ce serait
un désastre si Baltar devenait Président.
Je lui ai dit que j'étais d'accord,
mais que ce qu'il avait
fait était illégal.
- On devra porter cela devant un tribunal
- Stop.
J'ai donné le feu vert à Tory.
Je ne savais pas exactement
ce qu'elle préparait.
Je n'étais sûrement pas au courant
pour le Colonel. Oh Dieux.
Mais je savais qu'elle
comptait truquer le vote.
Vous avez essayé de
détourner une élection ?
Oui, je l'ai fait.
Et je me suis fait prendre.
Mais Gaius Baltar
ne doit pas devenir Président des
Colonies. Bill, ça ne doit pas arriver.
Laura...
- Je ne veux pas de lui comme Président,
- Il travaille avec les Cylons.
Je l'ai vu
juste avant l'attaque sur Caprica
avec une copie de
cette grande blonde cylon.
Le même modèle qui a accusé Baltar de
trahison avant de disparaître du Galactica.
Qu'est-ce que vous racontez ?
Pourquoi n'avez-vous rien dit avant ?
Parce que j'avais oublié
l'avoir vu avec cette femme
avant de m'en souvenir
quand j'étais mourante.
Ça peut paraître bizarre,
mais c'est vrai.
De la même manière, Kobol existe.
et la tombe d'Athéna existe,
et la carte vers la Terre existe.
Baltar travaille avec les Cylons.
Même si c'est vrai,
vous n'avez aucune preuve.
Non, je n'en ai pas.
Allons-nous truquer les résultats
d'une élection démocratique ou non ?
C'est ça la décision à prendre, car
si nous faisons ça,
nous serons des criminels
jamais inculpés, peut être,
mais criminels quand même.
Oui, nous le serons.
Vous n'allez pas faire ça.
Nous sommes allés jusque là,
- mais c'est terminé.
- Pardon ?
Si vous tentez de détourner cette
élection, vous serez morte à l'intérieur
tout comme votre cancer
a atteint votre cœur.
Les gens ont fait leur choix.
Nous devrons vivre avec.
C'est le mauvais choix.
En effet.
Très bien, très bien, très bien.
Donc ça y'est.
On abandonne, comme ça.
La bataille, peut être.
Mais pas la guerre.
L'important c'est que l'erreur
a été découverte et corrigée.
Vous avez été élu Président,
félicitations.
Merci beaucoup, Amiral.
Maintenant à propos de cette erreur.
Quel type d'erreur de comptage
pourrait arriver sur votre vaisseau
qui pourrait faire basculer plusieurs
milliers de votes en ma faveur
au profit de votre candidate
préférée, Amiral ?
Dès que j'en aurai le temps,
j'ouvrirai une enquête.
Je vous suggère
de savourer votre victoire.
et d'en rester là, Docteur.
Je vais vous montrer que je peux
être magnanime dans la victoire, Amiral.
Je crois que le titre honorifique correct
aujourd'hui est Monsieur le Président.
Mettez le cap vers New Caprica.
Saut terminé, nous sommes
en orbite autour de New Caprica.
Tous les vaisseaux sont
présents et au rapport, monsieur.
Envoyez un signal au Pegasus,
qu'ils envoient leur première
équipe de reconnaissance au sol.
Observons bien notre nouveau foyer.
Que les dieux nous viennent en aide.
Bien...
Je pense que les chances
de nous voir seront
sans aucun doute
restreint par les responsabilités et
les exigences de mon nouveau statut.
Écoute-moi.
Mon nouveau Statut.
Mais, sûrement
Nous...
Nous aurons la possibilité
de communiquer
et de nous retrouver
- une fois sur New Caprica.
- Je ne vais pas à New Caprica.
Quoi ?
De quoi parles-tu ?
Je ne vais pas à New Caprica.
Nous allons tous
à New Caprica.
Nous tous.
Jusqu'au dernier d'entre nous.
C'est notre chance d'être ensemble.
D'être réunis à nouveau.
Non.
Je ne peux plus faire ça.
Reste.
Levez votre main droite
et répétez après moi.
"Moi, Gaius Baltar, déclare et affirme"
"Assumer la présidence
des 12 Colonies de Kobol,
"sans aucune réserve morale
ou arrière-pensée"
"Assumer la présidence
des 12 Colonies de Kobol,
"sans aucune réserve morale
ou arrière-pensée"
"Protéger et défendre
les articles de la Colonisation."
- "De tout mon être".
- "De tout mon être".
- Félicitations, Monsieur le Président.
- Merci.
<i>J'accepte le rôle accordé
par les Colonies</i>
<i>en toute humilité et gratitude.</i>
<i>Je vous remercie.</i>
<i>Non, attendez. Et maintenant</i>
puisque c'est la première
volonté du peuple
Je vais signer mon premier décret.
J'exige
l'établissement immédiat d'une colonie
sur la planète que nous avons nommée
"New Caprica."
Voici vos ordres.
Nous soupçonnons que la bombe
a été volée dans votre labo
puis transférée clandestinement
sur Cloud 9 par un agent cylon.
Je suppose que vous n'êtes pas intéressé
par une tasse de thé, Amiral ?
- Un verre d'ambroisie ?
- Monsieur le Président.
Cela pourrait être la première étape
d'une attaque coordonnée des Cylons.
Je propose que notre priorité
soit la sécurité interne.
Non.
Non, je ne pense pas.
Notre priorité est le peuple.
Veiller à ce qu'ils soient
établis en toute sécurité
sur New Caprica
Une fois que ce sera fait...
- Nous pourrons oublier cette tragédie.
- Vous ne m'écoutez pas.
Je n'ai pas à écouter.
Je suis le Président.
La colonisation commence dès maintenant.
Monsieur le Président.
Président Baltar. Bonjour, Monsieur.
Bonjour, Monsieur.
Monsieur le Président, le syndicat
a besoin de votre réponse.
Le syndicat.
Quand c'est pas le syndicat,
c'est le Quorum.
Quand c'est pas le Quorum,
c'est l'assemblée du peuple.
UN AN PLUS TARD
Nous avons survécu à un holocauste
nucléaire, Monsieur Gaeta.
Et les gens se plaignent de la météo.
- Ce n'est tout de même pas le temps...
- Bien, peu importe.
Combien y a-t-il eu d'attaques cylons
depuis ma nomination ?
- Combien ?
- Aucune, Monsieur.
Précisément. Alors pourquoi
les gens se plaignent ?
Dites au Syndicat de faire travailler leur
gros culs pour changer ou je rassemble
leurs chefs et je les mets en prison.
Je doute qu'ils apprécieraient cela.
- Je leur dirai, Monsieur le Président.
- Merci.
Bonjour.
Où sont mes pilules ?
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA
PATROUILLE DE DÉFENSE ORBITALE.
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA
PATROUILLE DE DEFENSE ORBITALE.
380ème JOUR
- Tu peux partir, d'accord ?
- Non, je ne suis pas d'accord.
J'ai l'impression
d'abandonner mon poste.
Il est temps d'arrêter, Saul. Tu le sais.
Plus de la moitié de l'équipage
est déjà à terre.
On a peine de quoi
entraîner un escadron
encore moins de quoi faire
voler un bataillon décent.
- On ne fait plus grand chose ici.
- Mais tu restes...
Ouais, mais quelqu'un doit
s'occuper du phare.
Je resterai alors,
et m'en occuperai avec toi.
J'apprécie.
Tu sais qu'il n'y a
qu'une personne par phare.
On sait tous les deux que les Cylons
peuvent toujours se pointer.
Tout est possible.
On orbite autour de New Caprica
depuis plus de temps qu'a duré
notre fuite après l'attaque.
Je ne pense pas qu'ils reviendront.
Colonel...
Bonne chance.
Si elle te cause trop de problèmes.
trouve-t'en une plus jeune.
T'as pas vu Sam ?
- Je crois qu'il joue à Pyramide là-bas.
- Merci.
Sam, espèce de crétin !
Je te cherchais partout.
Bordel, à quoi tu penses ?
Je vais avoir des ennuis.
Le docteur Cottle est là. Tu es malade.
Tu devrais être au lit.
Je préfère
expulser ça de mon organisme ici plutôt
que rester alité toute la journée.
Sam, viens.
Allez.
- Le devoir m'appelle...
- Tu dois rester fort.
- Allez, Anders.
- Demain, vieux. Même heure, même score.
Alors envoie-nous un autre joueur.
J'y crois pas, j'ai épousé un abruti.
Ça va aller ?
Oui.
Je vais bien.
Allons-y.
Je reviens tout de suite, ok ?
Docteur, attendez.
Alors ?
Il a du liquide dans les poumons.
C'est sans doute une pneumonie.
Alors donnez-lui quelque chose.
Je le voudrais bien.
Je suis à cours d'antibiotiques
depuis des mois.
Alors quoi, c'est tout ?
J'ai un tas de patients à voir.
Mais il est jeune et robuste.
Alors faites-le se reposer.
Gardez-le au chaud.
Et avec un peu de chance,
il s'en remettra.
Fils de pute.
S'il vous plaît, calmez-vous.
Écoutez tous, juste un moment.
S'il vous plaît. Taisez-vous.
Fermez vos gueules !
Quand vous m'avez élu
président du Syndicat
j'avais promis de protéger nos emplois,
d'en conserver les bénéfices.
Mais surtout,
<i>de garder cette ville vivante.</i>
<i>Et bâtir un meilleur avenir.</i>
<i>J'avais promis
que nous garderions nos emplois.</i>
Regarde-toi.
<i>Je vais tenir cette promesse.</i>
- Je suis si contente de vous voir ici.
- Moi aussi.
C'est plutôt... excitant.
Ca vous passera vite.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ici ?
<i>- C'est le Président Baltar.
- Des milliers d'hommes, de femmes...</i>
<i>et d'enfants dépendent tous de notre...</i>
Monsieur,
Anders est vraiment malade.
Mais le docteur m'as envoyée bouler
et dit qu'il n'a plus d'antibiotiques.
C'est un tissu de conneries.
Pourriez-vous faire quelque chose
pour me pistonner ?
Vous devriez appeler Apollo.
Le Pegasus garde des
médicaments en réserve.
Il en mettrait de côté pour vous.
Ouais. J'en doute.
C'était il y a longtemps.
Les gens changent.
<i>... assurance maladie, vivres et
indemnités équitables.</i>
<i>Oui ! Nous avons une
responsabilité capitale.</i>
Ok.
<i>Mais vient un temps...</i>
<i>où vous réalisez que la machine
que vous avez construite,</i>
avec votre sang
et votre sueur
et vos larmes
est utilisée à une fin si abjecte, si...
pervertie
que cela vous rend malade
dans votre cœur.
Et c'est là que vous devez
vous jetez sur les rouages,
sur les leviers et sur la machine
elle-même et l'arrêter.
Et vous devez montrer aux personnes
qui la dirigent,
aux personnes qui la contrôlent,
que tant que nous ne serons pas libres,
nous empêcheront totalement
cette machine de fonctionner.
Grève !
Grève ! Grève ! Grève !
Ok. Tout le monde y est ?
Oui.
Bien, vous êtes attentifs.
Apparemment le Président a
quelques problèmes sur les bras.
Je veux aussi que vous
regardiez le chapitre X.
C'est l'histoire des Douze Colonies.
C'est vraiment intéressant.
Les problèmes du Président
ne sont pas les nôtres, n'est-ce pas ?
C'est exact.
Nos préoccupations sont les devoirs
pour tout le monde ce soir.
Maintenant certains vont rester
et m'aider pour la présentation
du projet d'art.
Tous les autres,
vos parents sont là.
Prenez vos affaires, allez-y.
Allez. Sortez d'ici. Bon travail.
Oui. D'accord.
Au revoir, trésor.
Merci. Bon boulot.
Bon travail.
Merci les parents.
Vous savez quoi,
vous pouvez y allez, vous et le bébé.
- D'accord ? Je m'occupe du reste.
- Vous êtes sûre ?
Oui. Allez-y.
Une tête à Toto. J'adore.
Bonjour, Isis.
BATTLESTAR PEGASUS
COMMANDANT : LEE ADAMA.
Bonjour, qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
C'est pour vous.
Qui c'est ?
C'est pour vous.
Qui c'est ?
Bien.
<i>Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?</i>
J'ai besoin d'une faveur.
Vraiment ?
J'ai entendu dire que tu avais...
gardé un bon tas
d'antibiotiques pour les pilotes.
Où as-tu entendu ça ?
Anders est malade.
Il a une pneumonie, Lee.
<i>Je pense qu'il...</i>
<i>pourrait mourir.</i>
Commandant.
Attends.
Oui, Lieutenant. Qu'y-a-t-il ?
Je ne suis pas sûre.
J'ai remarqué quelque
chose sur le Dradis.
Le Dradis ? Comment pouvez-vous voir
quelque chose dans cette soupe ?
- Là, voilà.
- C'est quoi ?
Une minute, c'est quoi ça ?
Oh, Dieux,
c'est une flotte cylon.
Ils nous ont trouvés.
<i>Nous devons dégager de là, Monsieur.</i>
On ne peut pas laisser
tous ces gens derrière.
On ne peut rien faire.
Ça nous prendrait une éternité de nous
mettre en poste de combat.
<i>Nous ne sommes pas
en mesure de combattre.</i>
Ils vont être anéantis.
<i>Nous n'avons pas le choix. Nous devons
nous en aller d'ici immédiatement !</i>
Tous les ponts sont enfin
en Condition 1, Monsieur.
Devons-nous lancer les chasseurs ?
Non.
Commencez les procédures
de saut. Nous partons.
Mais nous reviendrons.
Débutez votre procédure.
Monsieur le Président !
- Vous ne frappez pas ?
- Gaius.
- Gaius !
- Ouais, qu'y a-t-il ?
Les Cylons viennent d'entrer en orbite
et la flotte a sauté.
Le Jour du Jugement dernier.
Je recherche Kara Thrace.
Je m'appelle Gaius Baltar.
Président des Colonies.
Je sais qui tu es, Gaius.
Je te connais très bien.
Tant que vous ne résistez pas,
vous ne risquez rien.
- Comment en être sûr ?
- Vous ne pouvez pas.
Vous n'avez pas non plus d'autre choix.
Comment nous avez-vous retrouvés ?
C'était un pur accident,
en fait.
Nous étions à plus d'une année-lumière
d'ici quand nous avons détecté...
des traces de radiations
d'une détonation nucléaire.
Très bien.
Au nom du peuple des Douze Colonies,
je capitule.
Que voulez-vous faire maintenant,
Capitaine ?
Faire ce qu'on fait toujours,
les combattre jusqu'au bout.
- =( Team Lords of Kobol )= -
A bientôt pour la saison 3 !!!

Première partie</b>

Merci à jrzac

Laissez passer !
Excusez-moi.
Comme je le disais,
la forme suit de la fonction.
Aujourd'hui, nulle part cet axiome de
conception n'est plus apparent
qu'à bord du mondialement célèbre
Battlestar Galactica.
Ce vaisseau, le dernier de sa série
encore en service, a été...
... a été construit il y a 50 ans, durant les
premiers jours de la guerre contre les Cylons.
A l'origine, il y avait 12 Battlestar, chacun
représentant une des 12 colonies de Kobol.
Galactica représentait Caprica, et il fût commandé
la première fois par le Commandant Dash...
La guerre contre les Cylons est terminée depuis longtemps.
Cependant, nous ne devons pas oublier les raisons
du sacrifice de beaucoup au nom de la liberté...
- Commandant Adama, si je peux me permettre.
- Capitaine.
Je voulais simplement vous dire que ce fût un plaisir
- de servir sous vos ordres, monsieur.
- Merci Capitaine Kelly, ce fût un honneur pour moi.
- Bonne chance pour votre prochaine affectation.
- Merci, monsieur.
La guerre contre les Cylons est terminée
depuis longtemps...
- Bonjour, monsieur.
- Bonjour, Starbuck.
- Quel bruit court ?
- Seulement celui de la pluie.
Alors prenez votre arme et faîtes rentrer le chat.
Boum, boum, boum.
Attention !
Garde d'honneur, au hangar tribord
pour briefing de cérémonie et répétition.
Allez, les gars.
Le chef va nous botter le cul.
Ouais, eh bien, tu étais celui supposé l'envelopper hier.
Chut, voilà le vieux.
Trop tard, qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Rien, monsieur.
juste une autre fuite dans cette foutue fenêtre.
- Pardonnez-moi, monsieur.
- C'est supposé être un Battlestar, pas un musée.
Désolé de dire ça, monsieur.
Je ne peux que vous approuver.
Faites attention là-bas, d'accord ?
La guerre contre les Cylons est terminée depuis longtemps.
Mais nous ne devons pas oublier les raisons du...
Bonjour, monsieur.
Bonjour.
Rapport des communications de la surveillance.
Quelque chose d'intéressant?
Rien que la routine.
il y avait juste un message bizarre.
Nous l'avons copier.
Il vient du quartier général de la flotte, monsieur.
Retard du retour de l'officier postal
de la station de l'armistice.
Ils ont demandé un rapport complet
de l'état de tous les vaisseaux F.T.L.
juste au cas où ils auraient besoin
de quelqu'un pour une sortie, aujourd'hui,
si le vaisseau a
des problèmes mécaniques.
Je pense que nous sommes un peu plus occupés aujourd'hui.
Vous en pensez quoi, Lieutenant?
- Oui, monsieur.
- Je suis content que nous soyons d'accord.
Et j'en profite pour vous dire que
ce fut aussi un plaisir
et un honneur de servir sous vos ordres,
ces trois dernières années.
Tout l'honneur est pour moi, Lieutenant Gaeta.
La guerre des Cyclons est...
Colonel ?
Vous allez voir des choses qui vont
vous paraître bizarres, ou même antiques.
Bonjour.
Antiques pour nous,
comme des téléphones avec fil,
des commandes manuelles incommodes,
des ordinateurs qui n'ont
jusque que le nom.
Ils étaient tous conçus pour opérer
contre un ennemi qui pouvait infiltrer
et perturber tout sauf les systèmes informatiques les plus basiques.
Le Galactica est le vestige d'une époque,
où nous étions si effrayés par nos ennemis
que nous reculions pour nous protéger.
Bonjour.
Votre attention sur le pont !
-Chef.
- J'attends vos ordres.
Par ici, monsieur.
Un Mark 2.
je n'en ai pas vu depuis plus de 20 ans.
Si le commandant veut bien jeter un oeil...
Le numéro du cockpit.
Nebula 7242 Constellation.
Oh, mon dieu.
Où l'avez vous trouvé ?
Rouillant dans une décharge sur Sagitaria.
Nous espérons que le commandant
considérera la possibilité de le laisser
participer à la cérémonie de désarmement.
- Il vole ?!
- Oh oui, monsieur.
Nous avons restauré les moteurs,
mis à jour le système de guidage,
- et remplacé la plupart des contrôles de vol, le plein est fait...
- Vos gars sont incroyables.
...il est armé, et prêt à voler, monsieur.
Commandant ?
Quoi ? Encore ?
Quelqu'un veut s'offrir une promotion ici ?
Je pense que c'est peut-être Prosna, monsieur.
Il a trouvé ça aux archives de la flotte,
après quelques recherches au musée.
Merci.
Merci à tous.
C'est un honneur.
De rien, monsieur.
Rompez.
<i>Attention, attention.
Numéro 3, prêt !</i>
- On y va.
- Si vous voulez jouer avec les grands...
- Sans moi.
- Je suis.
- Et toi, XO.
- Je suis.
- Oh, Helo.
Quand as-tu appris ?
D'abord, tu voles comme un pied...
- et puis tu paries contre Starbuck.
- Starbuck.
Maintenant, c'est votre diminutif...
Starbuck.
Star-bok-bok-bok-bok.
Où avez-vous eu ce surnom ?
C'était avant d'aller en cage pour beuverie
et bagarre comme cadet, ou après ?
- Après.
- Après. C'est vrai...
- C'était... après.
- Je suis.
- A toi, XO.
- Je suis.
- Voici 30 de plus.
- Comment va votre femme ?
C'est trop tôt pour payer en nature.
Vous connaissez ce jeu
de pyramides sur Geminon ?
Qu'est-ce que tu faisais sur Geminon ?
- Un fille que je connais!
- Quelle fille ne te connais pas ?
Ma femme va bien.
- Vous lui avez parlé dernièrement ?
- A vous de parier, Lieutenant.
D'accord.
30 pour moi.
Et on dirait que ce gentil petit jeu est
terminé parce que j'ai un...
...full !
Ok, ça va, ça va.
Vous êtes vraiment allée trop loin cette fois.
Lieutenant, considérez-vous en état
d'arrestation et suspendue de vos fonctions.
Mettez la en cellule.
Messieurs.
Vous maintenez vos accusations
contre Kara ?
Pour voie de fait sur un officier supérieur?
Bien sûr que je les maintiens.
J'ai entendu dire que vous avez commencé
de bonne heure pour votre jour de repos.
Je n'étais pas de service.
Où avez vous eu ça ?
Les gars de Tyrol l'ont déniché.
- Je ne pourrai pas vous en dissuader ?
- Aucune chance.
Elle est insubordonnée, indisciplinée.
Et sûrement le meilleur pilote
que j'ai vu de ma vie.
Meilleur que moi.
Aussi bon que vous.
Comme le diable.
Jésus.
Ecoutez, je ne veux pas excuser
son comportement.
Surtout les blagues
sur vos problèmes familiaux,
- mais vous avez renversé la table le premier.
- Je n'ai pas fait ça.
- A moins que...
- Vous l'avez fait.
Que diriez vous d'appliquer
la peine habituelle ?
Consignez la, qu'elle poireaute
jusqu'à notre retour sur Terre.
Vous avez toujours été trop gentil avec elle.
Eh bien, je suppose que je suis juste...
un vieux fou.
"Capricaville, Caprica"
J'ai bien peur que les tests soient positifs.
La tumeur est maligne.
Elle en est à un stade avancé...
Bon, j'ai aussi envoyé une copie de votre discours
sur le désarmement du Galactica au président.
Il nous reste un peu de temps pour le revoir,
nous avons le temps avant d'être...
- ...à bord du Galactica, donc...
- Excusez-moi.
<i>Mesdames et messieurs, c'est votre commandant
qui vous parle. Bienvenue à bord.</i>
<i>Nous volons vers le Galactica,
et la durée du vol</i>
<i>sera à peu prés de 5 heures et demi.
Restez assis s'il vous plaît, et détendez vous.</i>
<i>Bon voyage.</i>
"Marché du bord du fleuve, Capricaville"
- Comme ils sont petits.
- Je sais. Mais ils grandissent si vite.
Je peux ?
Bien sûr.
Si léger.
Si fragile.
Eh, eh! Ça va.
Ne pleure plus.
- On doit y aller.
- Bien sûr.
C'est étonnant la façon dont un si petit cou
peut supporter un tel poids.
Centara !
Chéri !
Allons-y !
- Je veux te montrer quelque chose.
- Ok !
- Oui, viens !
-  Laisse moi un moment.
Oh, mon dieu !
Il ne respire plus !
Oh ! Oh, mon dieu !
Oh, mon dieu !
Il ne respire plus ! Mon bébé !
Vous nous rejoignez
au jeu de pyramides sur Geminon,
Bienvenue sous les Feux de l'actualité,
notre émission hebdomadaire qui rencontre
les personnes qui font l'évènement sur Caprica.
Aujourd'hui, nous serons avec
le Docteur Gaius Baltar,
gagnant de trois récompenses majeures
au cours de sa carrière,
un personnage très médiatique, et un ami
personnel du président Adar.
Il travaille actuellement comme consultant
informatique auprès du ministère de la Défense,
mais il est plus connu pour ses idées controversées
sur la technologie informatique de pointe.
- Docteur Balthar, bienvenue.
- Merci, Kellan.
Premièrement, permettez-moi de vous
dire combien vous êtes ravissante
et deuxièmement, c'est réellement
un plaisir d'être avec vous dans cette émission.
Eh bien, nous sommes enchantés
de vous recevoir.
Pouvez-vous rappeler vos idées
pour nos spectateurs ?
Oui, j'en serai heureux.
Ma position est très simple.
L'interdiction dans larecherche et le développement
de l'intelligence artificielle est,
nous le savons tous,
une conséquence de la guerre contre les Cylons.
Hônnetement, je trouve que c'est
un concept démodé.
Il ne sert aucun but utile,
excepté à ruiner nos efforts.
Je t'ai manqué ?
Tu ne peux pas le dire ?
Je manque à ton corps,
mais qu'en est-il de ton coeur ?
- Ton esprit ?
- Oui, aux deux.
- Est-ce que tu m'aimes, Gaius ?
- Quoi ?
Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?
Tu es sérieuse ?
Tu m'as... J'ai eu peur...
pendant une minute.
J'ai chaud, Gaius.
J'ai si chaud.
Viper 450, ici Galactica.
En approche manuelle du quai, vitesse à 105.
Le contrôleur est rouge.
Vérifiez ça.
Galactica, ici Viper 450. C'est vérifié.
Vous avez dit approche manuelle ?
Viper 450, affirmatif.
Approche manuelle.
Compris, Galactica.
Quai de stationnement, approche manuelle.
Vitesse 105. Verrouillage sur cible
d'atterrissage confirmé.
Patins abaissés, verrouillage magnétique.
Au nom du Galactica,
je vous souhaite la bienvenue à bord, Apollo.
C'est un honneur de vous avoir parmi nous.
- Bonjour, monsieur.
Chef Tyrol.
- Je serai votre chef d'équipage pendant votre séjour.
- Bonjour, Chef.
- Capitaine Lee Adama.
- C'est un réel plaisir de... vous rencontrer,
monsieur.
Je pense qu'on vous l'a déjà dit,
je suis un grand admirateur de votre père.
- Le service va lui manquer à la retraite.
- Eh bien, il manquera au moins à quelqu'un.
Votre système d'approche automatique est en panne ?
J'ai du faire les manoeuvres d'accostage manuellement.
Tout est manuel ici, Capitaine. Il n'y a pas de
système d'approche automatique sur le Galactica.
Ordre du Commandant Adama.
C'est vrai ?
<i>Attention zone hangar d'embarquement.
Raptor en atterrissage.</i>
<i>C'est dégagé.
Le contrôleur est rouge.</i>
Joli vol, Lieutenant.
Je pense que même le pont a entendu qu'il fallait dégager.
Ouais, je vais me faire l'officier en charge de l'approche,
Mais ce n'était pas entièrement ma faute, Chef.
- Le cardan primaire se comporte encore mal.
- Oh, c'est encore la faute du cardan.
- Helo, est-ce que je ment ?
- Le cardan ne m'a pas semblé en bon état.
J'ai retiré ce cardan trois fois
et je l'ai démonté deux fois.
- Le problème ne vient pas du cardan, madame.
- Vous ne m'écoutez pas, Chef.
Lieutenant, j'écoute attentivement
ce que chacun de mes pilotes a à dire..
Vous n'êtes pas le seul, ici, à essayer d'accoster
les 50 tonnes du Raptor,
- sur une zone de hangar en mouvement
avec un mauvais cardan.
- J'ai dix ans d'expérience !
- Nous y sommes !
- Trouvez et démontez
chaque composant de chaque système
qui n'a jamais été installé
dans chaque vaisseau spatial de mon hangar.
- Ce cardan est cassé.
- La ferme, madame !
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour, monsieur!
Bien.
Aujourd'hui est un jour important.
Nous avons une démonstration à faire,
des manoeuvres en formation,
pour la cérémonie de désarmement.
J'ai fait quelques changements concernant
le plan du vol.
Le Lieutenant Thrace sera remplacé
par le Lieutenant Anders.
De plus, le Capitaine Lee Adama se joint à nous,
et il sera le pilote leader durant la démonstration.
- Veuillez souhaiter la bienvenue au Capitaine.
- Content de vous avoir. Bienvenue, Apollo.
Bienvenue à bord, Capitaine.
Maintenant, remerciez le Chef Tyrol et
son équipe, Capitaine,
vous allez avoir l'honneur de voler avec un Viper comme votre père, il y a presque 40 ans.
Super, c'est euh... c'est..
- C'est un grand honneur.
- Oui, en effet, Capitaine.
Et personnellement, je ne vois pas de meilleure
façon d'envoyer ce vaisseau à la retraite.
Cela peut t'intéresser de savoir que les
résultats définitifs du projet C.N.P. sont...
réalisés à près de 95% partout dans la flotte.
Applaudissements, s'il vous plaît.
Aucun applaudissement pour moi?
Je doute que vous ayez jamais fini
le projet sans moi.
- Oui, eh bien, tu as un peu aidé.
- j'ai réécrit la moitié de vos algorithmes.
D'accord, tu nous a été d'une grande aide,
mais n'oublies pas que tu as eu quelques chose en retour
Tout ce fouilli à l'intérieur du serveur de la Défense.
devrait te donner un avantage énorme
pour l'offre de contrat de l'année prochaine.
- Tu sais que ce n'est pas vraiment
pour ça que je l'ai fait.
- Non, tu l'as fait parce que tu m'aimes .
Ça, et Dieu voulait de moi que je t'aide.
Il t'a parlé, c'est ça?
Est-ce que vous aviez un tchat ?
Il ne m'a pas parlé au sens propre.
- Et tu ne dois pas te moquer de ma foi.
- Je suis désolé .
Je ne suis simplement pas très religieux .
Cela t'ennuie que je le sois ?
Ça m'embarrasse qu'une femme intelligente
et attirante, telle que toi,
croit en tout ce mysticisme
et ces superstitions. Mais...
...je suis disposé à oublier cela
à cause de tes autres attributs.
Je dois y aller.
J'ai quelqu'un à voir.
Vraiment ? Qui est-ce ?
je suis vraiment jaloux.
J'en doute .
Tu es si susceptible aujourd'hui .
Eh bien, en fait,
Je dois aussi voir quelqu'un.
Pour affaires. Un nouveau projet pour la Défense.
Donc, euh...
Tu m'appelles plus tard, d'accord ?
Il était temps.
Je me suis demandé quand vous arriveriez.
- Madame la Secrétaire Roslin.
- Oui ?
- Je suis M. Kirkeya.
- Keikeya.
- Oh, désolé. Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
Je m'appelle Aaron Doral.
Relations publiques.
- J'aimerais vous souhaiter la bienvenue
à bord du Galactica.
- Merci.
Si vous voulez bien me suivre,
Je vous conduirais à vos appartements.
<i>Votre attention à tous,</i>
<i>le Galactica accueille à son bord
madame la Secrétaire d'éducation, Laura Roslin.</i>
<i>La secrétaire est un membre
du cabinet du président,</i>
<i>et nous sommes honorés de sa présence
à bord de notre vaisseau</i>
<i>et de sa participation, cet après-midi
à la cérémonie de désarmement.</i>
Madame la ministre ?
Madame la ministre !
<i>Votre attention à tous,
E.V.A. en activité sur la coque.</i>
<i>N'utilisez aucun matériel électrique pendant
que le processus d'E.V.A. est en cours. Merci.</i>
Dedans ou dehors.
- Excusez-moi ?
- Entrez ou sortez. Fermez le panneau.
Désolé.
- Que cherchez vous ?
-Euh, les quartiers des visiteurs.
Je suis un visiteur.
Je ne l'aurait jamais deviné.
Ça dis les choses comme
où sont les toilettes ..
C'est un réseau informatique intégré,
et il n'y en aura pas à bord ce vaisseau.
J'ai entendu dire que vous êtes de ces gens
qui ont vraiment peur des ordinateurs .
Non, il y a beaucoup d'ordinateurs sur ce bâtiment,
mais ils ne sont pas en réseau.
Un réseau informatique serait simplement
plus rapide et plus facile pour les professeurs,
- être capable d'apprendre...
- Laissez-moi vous expliquer quelque chose.
Beaucoup d'hommes et de femmes ont perdu leurs vies
à bord ce vaisseau,
parce que quelqu'un voulait un ordinateur plus
rapide pour rendre la vie plus facile.
Je suis désolé si je dérange
vous ou vos professeurs
mais je ne permettrai pas qu'on établisse
un réseau informatique sur ce vaisseau
pendant que je commande. Est ce clair ?
- Oui, monsieur.
- Merci. Excusez-moi.
Ça me paraît familier.
Capitaine Adama, monsieur.
Désolé, je n'étais pas là pour vous saluer
avec le reste de l'escadron.
Ils vous ont assez lécher le cul ?
Alors...
Quelles sont les accusations, cette fois ?
Avoir frapper un connard de supérieur.
Et je parie que tu as attendu
toute la journée pour dire ça.
- Toute l'après-midi en fait.
- Ok.
Ça fait combien de temps ?
- Deux années.
- Deux années.
On commence à se faire vieux.
C'est comme si l'enterrement était hier.
Ouais.
Ton vieux va bien.
Nous n'en parlons pas beaucoup.
Peut-être deux, trois fois par an.
- Pourtant, ça le travaille encore.
- Je ne l'ai pas vu.
Pourquoi ?
- Kara, ne commences pas.
- Ça va durer encore longtemps ?
- Je n'ai rien fait.
- Il a perdu son fils, Lee.
Et qui en est le responsable ?
Ce bon vieux Lee.
Tu n'as pas changé.
Zak était mon frère.
Qu'est-ce qu'il était à moi ? Rien ?
Ce n'est pas ce que j'ai voulu dire.
Et tu sais...
Tu sais que tu dois y aller.
J'ai bien envie de frapper un autre
connard de supérieur.
Gaius...
Gaius !
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
- Qui diable êtes-vous ?
Sortez.
- Gaius, qui est cette femme ?
- C'est... c'est est une amie.
Enfin, plus qu'une amie.
Quand je dis amie...
Sortez.
C'est vraiment super.
Au revoir.
Ecoute, c'est, euh...
C'est moi, d'accord ?
Tout.. tout.. tout est de ma faute.
Je, euh... j'ai merdé.
J'ai déconné.
Je l'ai toujours été.
C'est un, euh...
C'est un défaut de mon caractère...
J'ai toujours détesté ça, et j'ai essayé de..
Épargne moi ta soi-disante
conscience et tes remords.
Je suis venu ici parce que j'ai
quelque chose à te dire.
Ok.
Oh, le voila.
Si vous pourriez juste...
Laissez lui de la place.
Capitaine, merci de vous joindre à nous.
Bonjour, Aaron Doral.
Si vous pouviez vous mettre juste là, debout,
nous voudrions quelques photos de vous
et du commandant.
Merci.
Bonjour, Capitaine.
Super, d'accord, messieurs.
Est-ce que vous pourriez vous rapprocher ?
Fantastique.
Euh, Commandant, pourriez-vous mettre
votre bras autour de votre fils ?
Super. Parfait.
D'accord, merci beaucoup.
Euh, on se voit à la cérémonie
Nous allons sortir par ici...
Et vous prenez à droite.
Un peu de... café ?
- Non, monsieur. Merci, monsieur.
- Pourquoi ne pas vous asseoir ?
Félicitations pour votre promotion, Capitaine.
Désolé de ne pas y avoir été.
Merci ,monsieur.
- Comment va ta mère ?
-  Elle s'est remariée.
C'est bien pour elle.
Nous en avons parlé il y a un an.
A coeurs ouverts. C'était bien.
Heureux de l'entendre, monsieur.
Est-ce que ce sera tout ?
Pourquoi ne me parles tu pas, Lee ?
- De quoi voulez vous tu veux parler ?
- De n'importe quoi. Tu es ici pour une heure.
Eh bien, je n'ai rien à dire.
Mes ordres sont d'être ici et
de participer à la cérémonie.
Donc je... je suis ici.
Et je vais participer à la cérémonie.
Il n'y avait...
Il n'y avait rien dans mes ordres à propos
d'une discussion à cœurs ouverts
avec mon père.
Les accidents arrivent dans le service.
- Papa, écoute, je...
- Tu sais, toutes les choses que tu m'as dîtes...
- Je ne voulais vraiment pas faire ça.
- ... la dernière fois que nous étions ensemble,
à l'enterrement.
- Elles résonnent encore dans mes oreilles
deux années après.
- Bien!
Bien, parce que...
Parce que tu sais quoi ?
Elles étaient vraies.
Zak avait le choix.
Tout les deux, vous l'aviez.
Un homme n'est plus un homme
lorsqu'il porte l'insigne d'un pilote de Viper.
- Ça ne te dit rien?
- Ce n'est pas juste, filston.
Non, ce n'est pas juste.
Parce que certains d'entre nous ne sont pas
fait pour porter l'uniforme.
- Il a gagné son insigne, comme nous tousi.
- Certains ne sont pas fait pour être pilote.
L'un de nous n'aurais sûrement pas fait
l'école de l'air si son vieux, son père,
- ne tirait pas les ficelles!
- Tu exagères.
Je n'ai rien fait de plus pour lui que
je n'aurai fait pour quelqu'un d'autre.
Tu ne m'écoutes même pas.
Pourquoi as-tu ça dans la tête ?
Zak n'appartenait pas à l'aviation.
Il ne voulait pas y être.
Il l'a seulement fait pour toi.
Admets le.
Tu l'as tué.
Ce sera tout, Capitaine.
Alors maintenant, tu me dis que..
Tu me dis que tu es une machine.
- Je suis une femme.
- Tu es une machine.
Une femme synthétique.
Un robot.
- Ça fait maintenant trois fois que je te le dis.
- Eh bien, pardonnes moi,
j'ai un petit peu de mal à te croire,
parce que personne n'a vu les Cylons dernièrement,
ils doivent encore ressembler à des toasteurs sur pattes.
Ces modèles existent toujours.
Ils ont leurs utilités.
Prouve le.
- Si tu es un Cylon, prouve-le maintenant.
- Je n'ai pas à le faire.
- Tu sais que je dis la vérité.
- Parfois ce qui semble être la vérité
ne l'est pas nécessairement,
parce que la vérité est que...
je n'en crois pas un mot.
Tu me crois parce que, au fond,
tu as toujours su qu'il y avait quelque chose
de différent en moi, un je ne sais quoi de plus.
Et tu me crois,
car cela flatte ton ego.
Croire que tu es le seul, parmi les milliards
de personnes des 12 colonies,
à avoir été choisi pour ma mission.
Ta mission ? Quelle mission ?
Tu savais que je voulais accéder
au serveur principal de la Défense.
La Défense...
Attends une minute.
Le serveur principal de la Défense ?
- Qu'est ce que tu entends par là ?
- Allez, Gaius.
Les fréquences de communication,
les plans du déploiement des forces.
- Un accès illimité à toutes les données.
- Oh, mon Dieu.
Je n'ai rien à voir avec ça.
- Tu sais que je n'ai rien à voir avec ça.
- Tu as cette surprenante capacité de mauvaise foi.
Comment fais tu ça ?
Combien de gens savent ? À mon sujet ?
Précisement, que je suis concerné.
Même maintenant, quand le destin de
tout ton monde est dans la balance,
tout ce à quoi tu penses,
c'est à ta petite personne.
As-tu une quelconque idée de ce qu'ils me feront
si ils le découvrent ?
- Ils t'accuserons sûrement de trahison.
- La trahison est passible de la peine de mort.
- C'est incroyable.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Je téléphone à mon avocat.
- Ce ne sera pas nécessaire.
Il saura quoi faire.
Il me sortira de là.
C'est le meilleur de la profession.
Ce ne sera pas nécessaire,
parce que dans quelques heures,
il n'y aura plus personne pour
t'accuser de quoique ce soit.
- Que veux-tu dire?
- Les enfants de l'humanité reviennent à la maison.
Aujourd'hui.
<i>J'aimerai encore tous vous remercier
de votre présence ici, et, Elosha,</i>
<i>merci beaucoup pour ces merveilleuses paroles.</i>
<i>La prochaine exhibition sera la dernière</i>
<i>de l'escadron du Galactica, sous les ordres
du Capitaine Lee Adama.</i>
Et maintenant c'est un grand plaisir
de vous présenter le dernier commandant du
Battlestar Galactica,
le Commandant Adama.
Merci beaucoup.
La guerre contre les Cylons est terminée depuis longtemps.
Cependant, nous ne devons pas oublier les raisons
du sacrifice de beaucoup
au nom de la liberté.
Le prix pour porter cet uniforme
peut être lourd, mais...
Parfois il est trop lourd.
Vous savez, pendant que nous combattions
les Cylons,
nous le faisions pour nous sauver de l'extinction,
mais nous n'avons jamais répondu
à la question pourquoi.
Pourquoi valons-nous la peine d'être sauvé ?
Nous sommes toujours des meurtriers.
A cause de l'avidité, la rancœur, la jalousie.
Et nous transmettons tous nos péchés
à nos enfants.
<i>Nous refusons d'accepter la responsabilité
de ce que nous avons fait,</i>
<i>comme ce que nous avons fait avec les Cylons.</i>
<i>Nous décidons de jouer à Dieu,</i>
<i>créer la vie.</i>
<i>Quand cette vie s'est retournée contre nous,</i>
<i>nous nous confortions dans la certitude que</i>
<i>ce n'était pas vraiment de notre faute.
Pas vraiment.</i>
On ne peux pas jouer à dieu ,
et se laver les mains
des choses que nous avons créées.
Un jour ou l'autre, le jour viendra
ou on ne pourra plus cacher toutes les choses
que nous avons faîtes.
Vous êtes un étonnant fils de pute.
<i>Corona-Heavy 798, ici Viper 7242.</i>
<i>Mon indicatif est Apollo, et je serai votre
escorte pour le retour sur Caprica.</i>
<i>Compris, Viper 7242.
Heureux que vous soyez avec nous, Apollo.</i>
<i>Viper 7242, Raptor 312.
Ici Boomer.</i>
<i>Je voulais juste dire que c'était
un honneur de voler avec vous, Apollo.</i>
<i>Mesdames et messieurs,
nous sommes en route pour Caprica.</i>
<i>Si vous regardez par le hublot,
vous pourrez voir un des vieux Viper</i>
<i>Mark 2 du Galactica, qui nous escorteront
jusqu'à notre retour.</i>
<i>Nous n'avons pas plus d'information pour l'instant.</i>
<i>Il ne reste plus aucun vaisseaux
pouvant quitter Caprica.</i>
<i>Euh, mais aucun ennemi n'est signalé
pour l'instant.</i>
<i>Les autorités disent qu'il ne semble y avoir aucun..</i>
Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?
Qu'est-ce que je vais faire ?
il n'y a pas d'issue.
- Je sais.
- Bien sûr que tu sais.
C'est toi qui a fait ça, n'est-ce pas ?
Attends.
Attends, il doit y avoir une façon de s'en sortir.
Je veux dire, tu dois avoir un plan d'évasion.
Tu ne vas pas être détruite par tes propres bombes, non ?
Comment tu t'en tires ?
Gaius, je ne peux pas mourir.
Si mon corps est détruit, mes souvenirs,
ma conscience,
seront introduit dans un nouveau corps.
Je me réveillerai juste quelque part ailleurs
avec un corps identique.
- Tu veux dire qu'il y en a d'autres comme toi ?
- Il existe 12 modèles.
- Je suis le numéro six.
- Je veux pas mourir.
- Je ne veux..
- Baisses-toi.
CIC à l'officier commandant.
- J'écoute.
- Désolé de vous déranger, monsieur,
mais nous avons un message prioritaire d'alerte 1
du quartier général de la flotte.
Il était transmis en clair.
En clair ? Que dit-il ?
Attention, à toutes les unités coloniales,
attaque Cylon en cours.
<i>Ceci n'est pas un exercice.</i>
J'arrive tout de suite.
<i>A vos postes, à vos postes.</i>
<i>Condition 1 dans tout le vaisseau.
Ceci n'est pas un exercice.</i>
<i>Je répète, à vos postes,
à vos postes.</i>
<i>Condition 1 dans tout le vaisseau.
Ceci n'est pas un exercice.</i>
<i>Je répète, à vos postes,
à vos postes.</i>
<i>Condition 1 dans tout le vaisseau.
Ceci n'est pas un exercice.</i>
- Pas un exercice ? Ça ne peut pas être sérieux.
- On dirait bien.
On attaque avec quoi ?
Le vaisseau n'a pas de munition.
Allez, les gars, on y va !
Libérez l'entrée du hangar
pour d'éventuelles arrivées !
Qu'est-ce qu'on a ?
Un vaisseau accidenté ?
Combat ? Compris.
Condition un, opérationnelle.
Tous les ponts sont prêts, monsieur.
- Très bien.
- C'est une blague.
La flotte nous fait une blague.
C'est une farce pour le désarmement.
- Allons!
- Je ne pense pas.
Ici le Commandant.
Il y a quelques instants, ce vaisseau a reçu le message
qu'une attaque Cylon, contre nos planètes, était en cours.
Nous ne connaissons pas l'ampleur des dispositions
ni la force des troupes ennemis,
mais tout indique
un assaut massif contre les défenses coloniales.
L'Amiral Nagala a pris le commandement
de la flotte
à bord du Battlestar Atlantia,
juste après la totale destruction du quartier général de la flotte de Picon
durant la première vague d'attaques.
Comment... Pourquoi...
n'a plus vraiment d'importance maintenant.
L'important est qu'à partir de maintenant,
nous sommes en guerre.
Vous êtes entraînés pour ça.
Vous êtes prêts pour ça.
Faîtes votre devoir,
ayez confiance en vos frères d'armes,
et nous vaincrons.
D'autres annonces, dès que nous en saurons plus.
Merci
En guerre contre les Cylons.
D'accord, les gars,
C'est ce que nous devons faire.
Nous sommes les meilleurs.
Faisons marcher ce vieux coucou
et bottons quelques culs de Cylons !
Allez ! on y va ! C'est parti !
C'est mieux pour de vrai.
Tactique. Commencer à rassembler les unités
militaires du système solaire,
- amies ou ennemies.
- Oui, monsieur.
- XO.
- Monsieur.
C'est une guerre de tirs.
On a besoin d'avoir quelque chose à tirer.
Je vais vérifier où trouver des dépôts
de munitions.
D.
Envoyez un signal à notre escadron de chasse.
Je veux leurs positions et leur statut tactique
immédiatement.
- Oui, monsieur.
- Et faites sortir Kara Thrace de sa cellule.
"Escadron d'attaque du Galactica
A 2 heures de Caprica"
<i>Boomer, signal de reconnaissance du Galactica.
Envoyez leur notre position.</i>
<i>Dîtes leur que nous avons détecté une formation
de chasseurs cylons droit devant,</i>
<i>et que j'ai l'intention d'attaquer.</i>
<i>Boomer, tu me reçois ?</i>
- Reçu !
- Du calme, Boomer.
- Reprends ton souffle.
- Ok.
On est prêt.
- Helo ?
- J'en vois dix...
Non, non, cinq chasseurs cylons
à 324, marque 110.
Vitesse 7.1,
Arrivée dans...
- 7 minutes.
- Vous n'en avez pas l'air sûr !
Il y a pas mal de brouillage. Les Cylons utilisent
beaucoup de leurres qui leur ressemblent.
<i>Compris. Prenez votre temps,
et guidez nous, nous ferons le reste.</i>
Bien, monsieur.
Ça placera notre escadron à peu près ici.
Maintenant, on dirait que le combat principal
prend forme ici, près de l'orbite de Virgon,
mais même à toute vitesse,
ils n'y seront que dans une heure.
Tracer une ligne le long de cet axe.
Si nous pouvons garder Virgon entre nous et la bataille,
nous pourrions obtenir une belle victoire
avant même que les Cylons ne s'en rende compte.
- Au moins, monsieur.
- Commandant.
- Prêt à faire mon devoir, monsieur.
- Bien.
D'où viennent les Cylons ?
Tout ce dont nous sommes sûrs, c'est qu'ils
nous ont totalement pris par surprise,
et nous avons de lourdes pertes. Nous avons
perdus 30 Battlestar dans la première attaque.
- C'est un quart de la flotte.
- J'ai besoin de pilotes, et j'ai besoin de chasseurs.
Vous avez des pilotes.
Il y en a 20
qui descendent dans la salle de briefing,
mais des chasseurs...
Je pense me rappeler qu'il y avait
un escadron entier de chasseurs en bas
sur la plate-forme droite du hangar, hier.
Oui, monsieur.
"Musée du Battlestar Galactica"
Tu es sûr qu'ils voleront ?
Eh bien, leurs réacteurs sont encore chauds.
Donc, tout ce que nous avons à faire,
c'est enlever les butoirs du moteur,
faire le plein,
charger l'artillerie, et on sera prêt.
Le plus gros problème est de les amener
au compartiment gauche de lancement.
- Pourquoi ne pas employer le droit ?
- C'est une boutique de souvenirs maintenant.
- Tu déconnes..
-Ok, c'est parti !
Tout le monde m'écoute !
Nous allons au compartiment gauche de lancement.
- Quelles sont les nouvelles, D. ?
- Beaucoup de confusion.
Je continue de recevoir ces rapports étranges
au sujet des défauts de fonctionnement.
- Eh bien, en quoi est-ce étrange ?
- C'est le nombre de défauts.
Un rapport a indiqué que toute la puissance d'un Battlestar
avait été perdue juste avant le contact avec l'ennemi.
Ils ont dit que c'était comme si quelqu'un
avait simplement enlevé la prise.
Formation cylon droit devant.
On a deux présences cylons confirmés maintenant.
Bientôt en visuel.
<i>Ok, Boomer.
On prend le relais à partir d'ici.</i>
- Dégagez !
- Bien reçu .
<i>D'accord, tout le monde,
on se place en formation d'attaque.</i>
<i>Il semble n'y en avoir que de deux,
mais je veux que vous soyez vigilants,</i>
<i>et ne les sous-estimez pas.</i>
<i>- Quelqu'un sait-il à quoi ressemble ces trucs ?
- D'après les images que j'ai vu de vieux chasseurs cylons,</i>
<i>ils ressemblent à de grandes ailes volantes.</i>
<i>Ces images ont 40 ans.</i>
<i>Ok, arrêtez ces bavardages.</i>
Cag, Boomer.
On en sait plus sur le contact,
on dirait au moins deux escadrons.
<i>A tous les Vipers, tenez vous prêts.</i>
<i>Allons se les faire.</i>
<i>Qu'est ce que...</i>
<i>J'ai perdu de la puissance.</i>
<i>Jolly !
Jolly, on décroche !</i>
<i>Jolly, tu m'entends ?</i>
Qu'est-ce qu'ils font ?
Je ne sais pas.
Ils se rentrent dedans.
Les communications sont coupées.
On n'entend plus rien.
Cag, Boomer.
Cag, Boomer. tu me reçois ?
<i>Boomer, c'est Cag.
Si tu peux m'entendre,</i>
<i>ils doivent avoir fait quelque chose à nos systèmes
électroniques, grâce à une sorte de brouillage.</i>
<i>Je n'ai jamais rien vu de tel.</i>
<i>il n'y a pas de cockpits.</i>
<i>Il n'y a personne à l'intérieur de ces choses.</i>
<i>Oh, mon Dieu !</i>
Non !
- Boomer, tirons-nous de là.
- D'accord.
"Vol Colonial 798
A 3 heures de Caprica"
De nouveau, nous traitons
les informations qui nous sont données.
Et je vous invite tous à rester calme.
Lorsque nous aurons plus d'informations,
nous vous les communiquerons.
Nous apprécions votre patience.
Merci.
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- Je ne suis pas sûr.
Vous avez trouvé quelque chose, Capitaine?
<i>Non, rien que du brouhaha complètement brouillé</i>
Pour être honnête avec vous,
je suis heureux que vous restiez avec nous.
On se sent mieux de vous savoir là.
<i>Ne soyez pas si sûr.</i>
<i>C'est un vieux coucou qui était destiné
au spectacle, pas au combat.</i>
<i>Et si il y a un problème,
je ferai ce que je peux vous protéger.</i>
<i>Mais au moindre signe,
mettez le gomme et dégagez.</i>
Ne vous inquiétez pas.
J'ai la main sur le manette des gaz.
je ne l'ai pas quitté depuis le premier message.
Colonial heavy 798. Terminé.
Deux missiles arrivent !
- Utilise le brouilleur.
- J'essaye.
- Je n'arrive pas à trouver la fréquence.
- Envoie le leurre.
Deux à gauche.
Et merde.
- Ah, fais chier !
- Quoi ?
- Regarde sur l'écran.
- On dirait qu'on a trouvé le combat principal.
- Missile verrouillé.
- Nous en avons un à gauche.
- Nous sommes touchés.
- Non, sérieux ?
Helo, ça va ?
- Est-ce que ça va ?
- Présent!
Reste avec moi.
D'accord. Nous avons une fuite de carburant.
Nous devons atterrir et réparer ça.
- on n'est pas loin de Caprica.
- Il y a pas mal de monde entre nous et elle.
Ouais.
- On coupe les moteurs ?
- C'est la meilleure façon d'éviter d'attirer l'attention.
Pas de signature énergétique.
À moins que quelqu'un se rapproche
assez pour nous détecter,
on ressemble juste à un tas de débris
pour les sondes.
Je pense que nous avons assez d'inertie
pour atteindre l'ionosphère de caprica.
- Puis on redémarre, et on trouve un endroit pour atterrir.
- Joli.
C'est bien pensé.
Les rapports préliminaires indiquent...
qu'un engin thermonucléaire
d'environ 50 mégatonnes...
a explosé au-dessus de Caprica city,
il y a 30 minutes.
D'autres détonations ont été signalées sur les planètes
Aeriana, Picon, Sagitaria et Geminon.
aucun rapport concernant le nombres de victimes,
mais il sera sûrement très élevé.
Combien de personnes habitent Caprica city ?
Sept millions.
Nous ferons notre deuil plus tard.
Maintenant, le mieux que nous puissions faire
sur ce vaisseau, est de combattre.
- Oui ?
- Excusez-moi.
Un des passagers a une radio à ondes courtes.
Ils ont entendu que
Caprica a reçu une attaque nucléaire.
C'est vrai, n'est-ce pas ?
Caprica et trois autres colonies.
je suppose que je...
Je devrais aller faire une annonce
ou quelque chose.
je vais le faire.
Je suis un membre du cabinet ministériel.
C'est ma responsabilité.
Pendant que je le ferai,
est-ce que vous pourriez...
...contacter le ministère de la défense civile.
Voir ce que nous pouvons faire pour aider.
- Y compris les colonies de caprica...
- Oh, non.
- Picon.
- Oh, mon Dieu.
Aerilon et Tauran.
- Et Trevor ?
- Vous savez quelque chose au sujet de Trevor ?
- Et de Geminon ? Rien sur Geminon ?
- Mes enfants y sont !
Arrêtez, arrêtez.
S'il vous plaît, arrêtez.
je vous en prie, j'essaye de joindre le gouvernement
en ce moment même pour obtenir plus d'informations.
Pendant ce temps, vous devriez vous préparer
à un séjour prolongé à bord de ce vaisseau, d'accord ?
Donc, euh, vous, s'il vous plaît, et vous,
faites un inventaire des
réserves et des rations d'urgence.
Attendez une minute.
Qui vous a nommé responsable ?
Eh bien, ça, c'est une bonne question.
La réponse n'est personne.
Mais c'est un vaisseau du gouvernement
et je suis membre de ce gouvernement
donc cela fait de moi le responsable.
Alors pourquoi ne pas m'aidez
et descendre dans la soute pour voir comment
l'aménager pour recevoir le maximum de monde.
Tout le monde, s'il vous plaît,
s'il vous plaît...
Essayez de rester calme.
Merci.
Voyons ces réserves.
Bien, voila la liste des passagers.
- Est-ce que ça va ?
- Oui. Oui.
Mes parents ont déménagé sur Picon
il y a deux mois,
pour être plus près de mes sœurs, de leurs familles
et de leurs petit-enfants et...
Euh...
Madame la ministre, nous avons votre liaison.
Dieu soit loué, vous n'êtes pas là.
Dieu soit loué.
- Jack...
- Où est le président ?
Où est le président, Jack ?
- Est-ce qu'il est vivant ?
- Je ne sais pas. Je pense.
Nous entendons toutes sortes de choses.
Les Cylons ont-ils fait des demandes ?
Savons-nous ce qu'ils veulent ?
Non, aucun contact.
J'en suis presque sûr.
Est-ce que quelqu'un...
Est-ce que quelqu'un a discuté de la possibilité
de reddition ? On l'a considéré ?
Après que Picon fut bombardée, le président proposa
une capitulation complète et sans condition.
- Les Cylons n'ont pas même répondu.
- Colonial heavy 798.
Où ça ?
Que devons nous faire ?
Euh, compris.
Les Cylons nous ont trouvés.
- Un missile se dirige vers nous.
- Mais que fait notre escorte ?
<i>Krypter, krypter, krypter.</i>
Ici Apollo à Colonial heavy 798,
Je déclare une urgence.
Mes systèmes de vol sont déconnectés.
Besoin d'assistance.
Ça en fait six.
- Comment ça se passe avec la fuite de carburant ?
- Presque fini.
On va bientôt pouvoir redécoller.
Voilà.
Là, ça devrait le faire.
Sharon.
Prends ton arme.
- Helo.
- Ne bouges pas.
"Soute du Colonial 798"
Capitaine, tout va bien ?
Je vais bien.
Euh, mon nom est Aaron Doral.
On s'est déjà rencontré.
On a pris quelques photos publicitaire de...
...vous et votre père. Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Des générateurs d'impulsion électrique du Galactica.
- Vraiment ? C'est intéressant.
Capitaine, j'aimerais vous dire
combien je suis heureux de vous voir.
Oh ?
Pourquoi ça ?
Eh bien, personnellement, je me sentirais bien
mieux avec quelqu'un de qualifié aux commandes.
Quelque chose ne va pas avec votre pilote ?
Non, c'est juste qu'il n'est pas celui
qui donne les ordres.
C'est... C'est une mauvaise situation,
n'est-ce pas, monsieur ?
- Oui, en effet.
- Oui.
Bon, et si nous transférons les conteneurs L
du compartiment 3 au compartiment 4.
Alors, nous aurions la 1, la 2,
et la 3 pour les passagers.
Oui, c'est faisable. Ça va être lourd
à déplacer sans chargeuses.
Un peu de dur labeur est juste ce dont ont
besoin les gens, en ce moment.
Capitaine.
Heureux de vous revoir.
De même.
Merci pour l'aide.
Vous devriez la remercier.
Commencez le transfert de cargaison
et préparez la zone A3 pour les survivants.
Bien, madame.
Désolé, mais quels survivants ?
Dès que l'attaque a commencé,
le gouvernement a ordonné
l'arrêt complet de tous les vaisseaux civils.
Maintenant, nous avons des centaines
des vaisseaux échoués dans le système solaire.
Certains sont perdus, certains sont endommagés,
certains perdent la puissance.
Nous avons assez d'espace ici
pour accueillir jusqu'à 500 personnes.
Nous allons avoir besoin du moindre espace.
Mais nous ne savons même pas qu'elle
est la situation tactique, dehors.
La situation est que nous sommes en train de perdre.
N'est-ce pas, Capitaine ?
Exact.
Ainsi nous prenons autant de personnes que nous le pouvons.
Nous essayons de trouver un asile sûr où atterrir.
Capitaine, j'aimerai que vous regardiez les cartes de
navigation afin de trouver un endroit pour nous cacher des Cylons.
Ce sera tout.
C'est la dame qui commande.
Ne vous approchez pa plus, d'accord ?
Installons nous juste ici.
Installez-vous, et personne ne sera blessé.
Je veux monter à bord.
Je vous donnerai 50 000 Cubits.
Nous ne prenons pas d'argent.
Ce n'est pas un vaisseau de sauvetage.
C'est un vaisseau militaire.
Nous ne prenons pas d'argent.
- S'il vous plaît, prenez mon neveu !
- Nous ne prenons pas l'argent.
Je monterai dans ce vaisseau.
- Et les enfants ?
- Et mon épouse ?
- Ouais, et les enfants ?
- D'accord, d'accord. D'accord.
Les enfants en premier.
Les enfants.
Combien sont-ils ?
- Allez.
- Il y a encore de la place, pas vrai ?
Allez, il y a encore de la place.
Bon, nous pouvons prendre trois personnes supplémentaires.
C'est la charge maximum si nous voulons
sortir de l'orbite.
- Qui va choisir les trois, vous ?
- Personne ne va choisir, personne.
La loterie le fera.
Chacun aura un numéro, on mettra les numéros
dans une boîte, on en sortira trois.
C'est tout !
Aucune discussion, c'est sans appel.
- Comment pouvons-nous vous faire confiance ?
-Et je tire sur la première personne
qui essaye d'embarquer avant.
Helo, prend ton manuel de vol,
et déchire des pages.

- On doit la sortir.
- Impossible. Nous n'avons pas de pièces de rechange.
Remontez d'un demi degré.
A gauche en avant.
Un quart, à droite toute.
<i>Contact enemi en approche,

<i>Portée 115. En approche.</i>

- Allez, vite, vite.
On ne peut qu'enlever la valve
et dériver tout le système.
On ne peut pas faire ça.
Le relais va lâcher.
Enlèvez juste la valve.
Feu ! je l'ai manqué !

Bon, dégagez le tube !

Envoyez-la.
Vite, vite !
Oh, putain de...

- Tenez bon, les gars.
- Allez.
Je vais bien.

Il a des armes atomiques.
C'est parti !!
Galactica, un missile nucléaire arrive sur vous.
A tous les vipers, dégagez, dégagez, dégagez.
- Accrochez vous, mon ami.
- Je n'avais pas entendu ça depuis un moment.
Galactica, ici Starbuck.
La section avant de la nacelle de vol bâbord
a subi d'importants dommages.
Galactica, vous avez de violentes décompressions
tout le long de la nacelle de vol bâbord.
Galactica, vous me recevez ?
Les niveaux de radiations sont dans les normes.
Le blindage de la coque a fait le plus dur.
Monsieur, les propulseurs arrières gauches sont bloqués.
Ceux de l'avant ne répondent plus.
Nous tournons dans le sens contraire des aiguilles d'une montre.
Envoyez une équipe CD en salle
de contrôles auxiliaires,
et qu'ils coupent l'arrivée de carburant
aux propulseurs avants.
Ok, nous avons des supports endommagés
le long de la nacelle bâbord,
et comme réaction en chaîne, des décompressions
partout à l'avant de la zone 2... 250.
C'est un problème.
Saul, prenez personnellement les commandes
des unités de Contrôle des Dégâts.
- Moi ?
- Monsieur, les propulseurs avants sont toujours bloqués.
Nous avons besoin de vous.
Vous êtes bien le second XO, non ?
Oui, monsieur.
<i>Attention, à tous les ponts, réglez
vos relais d'urgence d'énergie en flux positif.</i>
Allez, les gars, allez !
Grouillez vous, allez !
Chef, nous perdons de la pression !
Le port, tout est bloqué ! On a besoin d'aide !
Au rapport.
Toute la structure est endommagée sur cette ligne.
On doit éteindre ces feux !
Je sais, les coupe-feux sont HS.
L'arrivée d'eau est aussi HS.
J'essaye de l'éteindre avec les commandes manuelles.
Nous avons une autre décompression
vers la nacelle bâbord.
Quels sont vos ordres, monsieur ?
Monsieur ?
D'accord, écoutez, nous avons besoin de toutes
vos équipes CD vers le hangar d'atterrissage.
Aidons les à...
Pas le temps.
Condamnez tout à partir de la zone 30 et enclenchez
la ventilation de secours dans tous ces compartiments.
Attentez, j'ai plus de 100 personnes
coincées dans la zone 34.
- J'ai juste besoin d'une minute pour les sortir.
- Si nous ne le faisons pas maintenant,
nous allons perdre bien plus que 100 hommes.
Maintenant, condamnez tout.
- Ils ont juste besoin d'une minute !
- Nous n'avons pas une minute !
Si le feu atteint les nacelles du hangar,
il mettra le feu aux conduites de carburant,
et c'est le vaisseau que nous perdrons !
Faites-le !
<i>A tout l'équipage... condamnez...</i>
<i>toutes les zones de 25 à 40.
C'est un ordre.</i>
Sortir d'ici tout de suite !
Allez !
Je dois ventiler le compartiment !
Allez !
Ventilation terminée.
Les incendies sont éteints.
S'ils n'ont pas oublié leur entraînement,
qu'ils ont mis leur combinaison
et qu'ils se sont préparés à une possible
manoeuvre de ventilation...

- Oui, je n'ai fait rien.
Cette dame a le billet numéro 47.
Cette dame là.
Vous pouvez venir ici, s'il vous plaît ?
Qu'est ce que tu fais ?
Je donne ma place.
Sûrement pas !
Un civil devrait prendre ma place.
tu viens avec nous.
Regarde ces nuages.
Sharon, regarde ces nuages,
et dis moi que ce n'est pas la fin de tout.
- Helo...
- Quelque soit le futur,
il dépendra de qui sont les survivants.
Donne-moi une raison pour laquelle je suis un meilleur choix
qu'un des plus grands esprits de notre temps.
- Helo...
- Tu peux le faire sans moi.
Je sais que tu le peux.
Tu l'as prouvé.
Montez à bord.
Quoi ?
Attendez, attendez, attendez...
Je crois que tu ferais mieux d'y aller.

Quel est le bilan final ?
26 ont réussi à sortir.
Les 85 autres, non.
Il y a un dépôt de munitions à la base
d'ancrage de Ragnar.
Ça va être la merde pour ancrer le vaisseau là-bas.
Le manuel indique qu'il y a 50 palettes d'ogives
de classe D dans ce dépôt.
Il devrait également y avoir tous les missiles et
les munitions de petit calibre dont nous avons besoin.
- Allez vérifier ça.
- Oui, monsieur.
- Savez-vous combien nous en avons perdu ?
- Oui.
Installez une morgue provisoire
dans le hangar B.
40 secondes, monsieur.
C'est tout ce que je voulais: 40 secondes.
85 de mes hommes.
Et je lui ai dit...
Je lui ai dit à ce fils de pute...
Il est l'un des XO de ce vaisseau.
N'oubliez jamais cela.
Il a pris une décision difficile.
Si j'avais été lui,
j'aurais fait la même chose.
40 secondes... monsieur.
Retournez à votre poste, Chef.
Le dépôt de munitions existe bien,
mais nous avons deux problèmes:
Un,
Ragnar est à au moins 3 jours à vitesse maximale.
Deux,
toute la flotte cylon est sur le chemin.
- Spécialiste.
- Monsieur ?
- Donnez moi notre position.
- Bien, monsieur.
- Vous ne pouvez pas faire ça.
- Je le sais.
Aucun homme sain d'esprit ne le ferait.
Ça fait quoi ? 20, 22 ans ?
- Nous sommes entraînés pour ça.
- L'entraînement est une chose,
mais si nous nous trompons dans les calculs,
même de quelques degrés,
- nous pourrions finir en plein milieu du soleil.
- On n'a pas le choix.
Colonel Tigh, veuillez préparer un saut dans l'hyperespace
de notre position vers l'orbite de Ragnar.
Oui, monsieur.
Un message prioritaire, monsieur.
Opérateur, lancez les moteurs F.T.L. 1 et 2.
- Lancement des moteurs F.T.L. 1 et 2.

Non. Correction.

<i>Bien reçu, Colonial 1.

<i>Nous n'avons plus d'énergie

Accuser réception avec
le même protocole de cryptage.
"Adama."
Capitaine Apollo.
Veuillez informer le Commandant Adama
que nous sommes actuellement en plein opération
de sauvetage, et que nous avons besoin d'assistance.
Demandez-lui combien de lits d'hôpitaux disponibles il a,
et combien de temps il lui faudra pour venir ici.
- Je, euh...
- Oui ?
Je ne suis pas sûr qu'il répondra favorablement
à cette requête.
Alors, dites lui que cela vient directement
de la présidente des 12 colonies.
Et que ce n'est pas une demande.
Oui, madame.
Et, madame...
Apollo est simplement un surnom.
Mon nom est Lee Adama.
Je sais qui vous êtes.
Mais Capitaine Apollo, ça sonne bien,
vous ne trouvez pas ?
C'est une blague ?
- Sont ils à portée radio ?
- Oui, monsieur.
Colonial 1, ici Galactica.
<i>Le Galactica souhaite parler avec Apollo.</i>
Ici Apollo. Allez-y.
Monsieur.
Oui, est-ce que tu...
Votre vaisseau va bien ?
Nous allons tous les deux très bien.
Merci de le demander.
Est-ce que votre F.T.L. fonctionne ?
- Affirmatif.
- Alors, vos ordres sont d'aller vous
et tous vos passagers au point de rendez-vous.
Compris ?
Compris...
Message reçu.
- Qu'est-ce que cela signifie ?
- Ça signifie que je vous ai entendu.
Vous allez devoir faire mieux que ça, Capitaine.
Nous sommes engagés dans une opération
de sauvetage.
Vous devez abandonner cette mission
immédiatement et vous diriger vers Ragnar.
- La présidente m'a donné un ordre direct.
- Vous parlez de la ministre de l'éducation.
Nous sommes au beau milieu d'une guerre.
Et tu suis les ordres d'une maîtresse d'école ?
Nous avons des ennuis.
Attendez, Galactica.
Quoi ?
Chasseurs cylons en approche.
Dans combien de temps seront-ils là ?
Dans à peu prés: 2 minutes.
Il a raison, nous devons y aller
- tout de suite !
- Non !
- Madame la présidente, nous ne pouvons pas
défendre ce vaisseau..
- Nous n'allons pas abandonner toutes ces personnes.
- Mais, madame, si nous restons...
- J'ai pris ma décision, Capitaine.
- C'est vous le président.
- D'accord, très bien.
Permission de descendre ?
Monsieur, nous avons un relevé télémétrique
de la position du Capitaine Apollo,
et deux chasseurs ennemis se rendent sur ses coordonnées.
Colonial 1.
Ici le Galactica.
Apollo, des chasseurs ennemis arrivent sur vous.
Dégagez de là !
Apollo!
Apollo !

Lieutenant !
Qu'avez-vous fait à mon Viper ?
Je me demandais
pourquoi le moteur avait claqué.
On va devoir retirer tout le support.
Allez chercher le grand élévateur.
Je ne sais pas comment vous avez pu
voler et faire atterrir cette chose.
Je n'ai pas envie d'y penser maintenant.
Où est Prosna ?
Il va réparer ce putain de cardan verrouillé
ou je vais me le faire !
Il est mort, madame.
Il est mort dans l'incendie.
- On a perdu combien d'hommes ?
- 85.
Bien.
Lieutenant ?
Je ne sais pas si vous savez
pour Apollo, mais...
Si je sais quoi ?
Bien.
Des nouvelles de Sharon ?
Non, madame.
Ça va aller, Chef ?
Chef ?
Retournez au boulot.
Trois, deux, un... lancement.
- Drone déployé, en transmission.
- Ils vont venir nous chercher maintenant ?
Il y a beaucoup d'interférences par ici.
Pas mal de bruits.
Ça empêche la radio de fonctionner...
si tout va bien, une des ces sondes
que j'ai lancé doit être assez loin d'ici,
le vaisseau colonial entendra le signal
et il viendra nous chercher.
Tout le monde est mort sur Caprica ?
Je ne sais pas.
Mon père est dans la flotte coloniale.
Ils m'ont dit qu'il était porté disparu.
Mais je pense qu'il est mort, lui aussi.
Comment tu t'appelles ?
Tu sais quoi ? Mes parents sont morts
quand j'étais petite, aussi.
Tu vis avec qui ?
Un tas d'autres personnes sur un vaisseau
appelé le Galactica.
Tu sais ce que j'aime chez toi, Gaius ?
Tu es un battant.
Tout est ok.
Le vaisseau est paré à sauter,
Commandant.
Conduisez-nous à Ragnar, Colonel.
- Lieutenant Gaeta.
- Oui, Colonel ?
- Exécutez le saut.
- A tous les ponts, préparez-vous à un saut F.T.L.

de Ragnar.
- Colonel Tigh.

Mettons à jour votre carte pour
amorcer une descente

- Oui, Commandant.
<i>Attention, les officiers de la sécurité

<i>"Le Colonial One
A 4 heures de Caprica"</i>
Capitaine Apollo.
C'était marrant...
- Je crois que ça a marché.
- Qu'avez-vous fait exactement ?
J'ai simplement utilisé l'hyperdrive
pour manœuvrer les bobines d'énergie.
J'ai créé une grande impulsion
d'énergie électromagnétique
qui a dû neutraliser les ogives.
J'espère que ça ressemblait
à une explosion nucléaire.
Alors c'était ça...
- Alors...
- Ça a trompé les Cylons ?
Je ne sais pas.
Mais si ce n'était pas le cas, alors
on les aurait sur le dos en ce moment même.
Le reste de la flotte connait-il ce truc ?
Je ne pense pas. C'était juste une théorie
qu'on a exploré à l'école militaire, mais...
ça n'a jamais marché en simulation.
Les Cylons voyaient le subterfuge
et détruisaient les cibles.
La leçon ici est de ne poser
aucune autre question
mais de simplement dire "Merci, Capitaine Apollo,
d'avoir sauvé notre peau".
Pas de quoi.
Maintenant si je pouvais suggérer...
qu'on évacue les passagers et
qu'on fiche le camp avant que
les Cylons ne réalisent leur erreur.
Je suis d'accord, Capitaine.
- 5 secondes pour tourner de 3.
- 5 secondes. Oui, monsieur.
- Et tournez.
- Angle de l'avant : plus un demi degré.
Angle arrière : moins un quart.
Déviation de l'avant : Moins trois quart.
Nous entrons dans l'ionosphère.
<i>Tout le monde, attention aux secousses.</i>
Seigneurs de Kobol, entendez ma prière...
Prenez les âmes de vos fils et filles
morts en ce jour.

dans vos mains.

- Arrimage étanche effectué, Chef.
- Compris. L'arrimage étanche est confirmé.
- Allez me trouver des munitions, Chef.
- Bien reçu, Commandant.
Bien, prenez votre équipement.
On y va.
<i>"Réserve de munitions de la station de Ragnar"</i>
Très bien tout le monde,
on va faire ça vite !
Cally, trouve le générateur
et allume la lumière.
Oui, Chef.
Trouvons où est le monte-charge
et mettons-le en marche.
Venez.
Excusez-moi.
Mon mari, il est dans la flotte Coloniale
à Geminon.
La flotte Coloniale à Geminon. Je vais voir
ce que je peux faire. Venez par là.
Vous avez des nouvelles de Geminon ?
Approchez !
Capitaine, il ne me reste que 2 modules de
communication, monsieur, c'est tout.
Plus de transfo', ni de drones,
ni de balises, rien.
Au moins vous avez toujours votre
équipement électronique.
Mon vieux coucou peut à peine
aller de A à B.
Ce vieux coucou vous a peut-être
sauvé la vie, monsieur.
- Comment ça ?
- Le Viper Mark 7.
Les Cylons les éteignent comme s'ils
appuyaient sur un interrupteur.
et de nombreux rapports le confirment.
Les seuls chasseurs qui ont
une chance de succès
sont les anciens ou ceux qui nécessitent
une révision importante.
C'est lui ?
Ouais. J'espère qu'il en vaut la peine !
- Désolée, monsieur.
- Ne le soyez pas. Je l'espère aussi.
Docteur Baltar, Capitaine Lee Adama.
Le président a demandé à vous voir, monsieur.
- Le Président Adar est vivant ?
- Non, j'ai bien peur qu'Adar soit mort.
La Présidente Laura Roslin a prêté serment
il y a deux heures.
Qui ?
Si vous voulez bien me suivre,
elle est par là.
J'apprécie vraiment cela.
Merci beaucoup.
Docteur Baltar,
c'est un plaisir de vous rencontrer.
Nous nous sommes rencontrés au symposium
de Capricacity l'année dernière.
Oh oui, bien sûr.

Oh, non. Ce n'est rien.
Je suis sûre que je ne me
rappellerais pas de moi non plus.
Docteur, j'ai besoin de vous comme
conseiller scientifique et analyste en chef
au sujet des Cylons
et de leur technologie.
J'en serais honoré,
Madame la présidente.
- Lieutenant Valerii, c'est Valerii ?
- Oui.
J'ai cru comprendre que votre vaisseau a des
possibilités de vitesse supraluminique.
Oui, madame. Le Raptor a été conçu
pour faire de petits sauts
à l'avant de la flotte, servir d'éclaireur
et revenir faire son rapport.
Je veux que vous sortiez pour trouver
autant de survivants que possible
et les ramener ici.
Nous formerons alors un convoi.
Nous les guiderons hors de la zone
de combat vers un lieu sûr.
Oui, madame.
Que personne ne s'approche.
Je ne veux pas... de problème.
D'accord, parlons.
- Je n'irai pas en taule.
- Quoi ?
Vous m'entendez ?
Je n'irai pas en prison.
Personne ne vous mettra en prison.
Calmez-vous !
- C'est ça, ouais...
- Nous ne sommes pas de la police.
Nous ne sommes pas ici pour vous arrêter.
Maintenant, posez votre arme.
- Ouais, peut-être, alors qui êtes-vous ?
- Nous sommes de la flotte coloniale.
Nous sommes juste venus prendre
du matériel de la station
- pour retourner au combat.
- Quel combat ?
- Vous n'êtes pas au courant.
- Au courant de quoi ?
C'est la guerre.
Donnez-moi votre arme.
Vous me prenez pour un idiot ou quoi,
c'est ça ?
Vous croyez que je suis idiot et
que je vais avaler ça ?
Je veux un libre passage vers la sortie
sur un vaisseau de transport sûr
avec un système de saut non repérable, ok ?
Maintenant !
Écoutez...
Je n'ai pas le temps de discuter avec
vous alors voila le marché.
Nous avons plus de 2 000 personnes
sur ce vaisseau.
Maintenant, si vous pensez pouvoir tirer
Sur chacun d'entre nous, ok, mais sinon
tirez-vous de mon chemin !
- Maintenant !
- Ok.
Prenez son arme.
S'il bouge, tirez.
Je vois qu'ils t'ont mis au travail...
M'ignorer ne t'aidera pas.
Non, j'ai décidé que tu es
une expression de
mon subconscient s'exprimant
lors d'un état éveillé.
Alors, je suis seulement dans ta tête ?
Tout à fait.
As-tu considéré la possibilité que je peux
très bien exister seulement dans ta tête
sans être une hallucination ?
Peut-être peux-tu me voir et m'entendre
parce que, pendant ton sommeil,
j'ai implanté une puce dans ton cerveau
qui transmet mon image
directement dans ton esprit.
Non non non. Regarde, c'est moi encore...
Mon subconscient exprime
des peurs irrationnelles
que je choisis également d'ignorer.
Tu travailles sur quoi ?
Si tu étais une puce dans ma tête,
je n'aurais pas à te le dire, non ?
Fais-moi plaisir.
J'essaie de comprendre comment
vous avez pu mener ce genre d'attaque.
Vous avez quasiment démoli tout le réseau
de défense sans tirer un seul coup de feu.
Des escadrons entiers ont perdu toute
puissance au contact de l'ennemi.
Le CNP est un programme de navigation
mais tu...
Tu as fait des changements dans les programmes.
Tu disais que tu fabriquais...
des backdoors que ta société
pourrait exploiter plus tard.
Tout était vrai, dans un sens...
- C'était ton travail.
- Officiellement.
Officieusement,
j'avais d'autres motivations.
Nous avions quelque chose, Gaius...
Quelque chose...
... de spécial.
- C'est dingue.
- Et ce que je veux le plus...
C'est que tu m'aimes.
T'aimer ?
Bien sûr, Gaius.
Tu ne comprends pas ?
Dieu est amour.
Non !
Doucement les gars !
Ralentissez.
On n'en sait pas beaucoup plus,
on doit impérativement prendre
notre matériel et sortir d'ici.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a là dedans ?
Des trucs.
Donnez-moi une torche.
Où est votre vaisseau spatial ?
Arrimé de l'autre côté de la station.
Attention ! Ne les empilez pas si haut !
Ok, ces ogives là-bas,
voici l'idée :
Ils auraient rapporté un bon prix au marché noir.
Vous êtes un trafiquant d'armes, hein ?
Les gens ont le droit de se protéger.
Je leur en fournis juste les moyens.
Vous n'avez pas l'air bien.
Attention avec ça hein !
Hé ! Attention avec ça !
Attention !
Commandant ? Commandant Adama !
Reculez, Reculez ! C'est chaud !
C'est instable !
Vous, retournez au vaisseau.
Il nous faut des leviers,
des extincteurs,
et une torche à plasma.
- Attendez. Chef, écoutez.
- Allez-y !
Commandant ? Vous êtes là ?
Commandant, est-ce que ça va ?
- Commandant Adama ?
- Oui.
Il y a des blessés de votre côté ?
Non Monsieur.
L'équipement arrive.
On va vous sortir de là tout de suite.
Non !
Non, ramenez toutes les munitions
et tout l'équipement au vaisseau.
Ne perdez pas votre temps à autre chose.
- Y a-t-il une autre issue ?
- Oui.
Écoutez, on va sortir de l'autre côté.
- Je ne pense pas que ce soit très prudent.
- C'est un ordre.
Dites au colonel Tigh qu'il est
aux commandes jusqu'à mon retour.
Oui, Monsieur.
Allons-y.
<i>"Vaisseau de croisière botanique
A 5 heures de Caprica"</i>
La plupart des passagers viennent
de Geminon ou de Picon...
mais nous avons des gens de toutes les colonies.
Donnez à Billy une copie
de votre manifeste de passagers
et une liste de vos réserves d'urgence.
D'accord.
Et qu'en est-il de la situation énergétique ?
Nos batteries sont presque à plat.
Le capitaine Apollo fera un inventaire technique
de tous les vaisseaux cet après-midi.
En fait le capitaine a dit qu'il ne pourrait pas
lancer l'étude avant ce soir.
Très bien, ce soir alors.
Vos besoins seront pris
en considération, Capitaine.
Vous avez ma parole.
- Merci, Madame la présidente.
- Je vous en prie.
Salut.
- Comment t'appelles-tu ?
- Cami.
Bonjour, Cami. Moi, c'est Laura.
Tu es seule ?
Elle voyageait avec ses grands parents mais...
sa grand-mère a eu des problèmes de santé
depuis l'annonce.
Mais ne vous inquiétez pas,
nous nous occupons d'elle.
Mes parents vont venir me chercher
à l'astroport de Caprica City.
À l'astroport. Je vois.
Ils m'emmèneront dîner et
je prendrai une tourte au poulet.
ensuite on rentrera à la maison.
Et papa me lira une histoire.
et puis j'irai au lit.
Un message du lieutenant Valerii.
Elle a trouvé un vaisseau-raffinerie
rempli de Tylium.
Bien. Il était temps
qu'on ait un peu de chance.
Ca nous amène à une soixantaine
de vaisseaux jusqu'ici ?
- Pas mal pour quelques heures de travail.
- Effectivement, Madame.
Mais seuls une quarantaine de vaisseaux
ont accès à la vitesse supraluminique.
On devrait commencer à transférer les passagers
des autres...
à bord de ceux qui ont le FTL
le plus tôt possible.
Très bien.
Colonial One, Raptor 312.
Je suis de retour, et j'ai ramené un ami.
Bienvenue, Boomer.
On a pas mal de vaisseaux assoiffés
impatients de rencontrer votre ami.
Vous avez établi d'autres contacts ?
Négatif. Il n'y a plus personne.
- On a un visiteur !
- Vu. Vous pouvez brouiller son signal ?
J'essaye.
Il nous a scannés
avant de sauter.
On doit y aller maintenant.
Les Cylons seront là d'un instant à l'autre.
- Pourront-ils nous localiser après le saut ?
- Non. Impossible.
- Théoriquement impossible.
- Théoriquement.
Il reste des milliers de gens
dans les vaisseaux sub-luminiques.
- On ne peut pas les abandonner.
- Je suis d'accord.
On doit employer chaque seconde
pour transférer le maximum de gens.
On peut attendre de sauter jusqu'à
ce qu'on détecte un mouvement des Cylons.
On est des cibles faciles.
Ils vont sauter au milieu de nous...
avec des armes nucléaires et nous balayer
avant que nous n'ayons pu réagir.
On ne peut pas les laisser.
Vous sacrifieriez des milliers de personnes.
Mais on en sauvera
des dizaines de milliers.
Désolé d'en faire
une question de chiffres...
mais nous parlons
de la survie de notre espèce.
On n'a pas le luxe
de prendre des risques...
en croisant les doigts,
car si on perd, on perd tout.
Et Madame la Présidente,
il faut prendre une décision maintenant.
Ordonnez à la flotte
de sauter vers Ragnar immédiatement.
Madame la Présidente, il y a
autre chose que vous devriez savoir.
J'ai le cancer.
Je sais.
Des petites choses.
Des commentaires que vous avez faits.
Mon diagnostic n'est pas certain.
J'aimerais pouvoir dire que c'est le cadet
de mes soucis, mais le monde arrive à sa fin...
et tout ce à quoi je pense c'est que j'ai
le cancer et que je vais probablement mourir.
C'est égoïste, n'est-ce pas ?
Ce n'est pas égoïste.
C'est humain.
Vous vouliez me dire quelque chose ?
Je pensais
que vous deviez savoir.
Cette petite fille
que vous avez rencontrée, Cami.
Son vaisseau ne peut pas
faire le saut.
Merci.
Ici le commandant de bord.
Veuillez regagner vos places...
et vous tenir prêts pour le saut.
Merci.
Réglez la trajectoire ESB.
<i>Colonial One, pour l'Amour de Dieu,
vous ne pouvez pas nous laisser là.</i>
Réglée.
- Colonial One, ici Picon 36.
- Faites tourner les refroidisseurs.
<i>Je ne peux pas croire
que vous vouliez abandonner ces gens.</i>
Ils tournent.
<i>Dites-nous au moins où vous allez.
On vous suivra à vitesse normale.</i>
- Je vous en prie !
- Non.
S'ils sont capturés,
les Cylons le sauront aussi.
<i>J'ai 50 personnes à bord,
Colonial One, vous avez entendu ?</i>
- Mise en route du moteur FTL maintenant.
- Ne nous laissez pas ici.
<i>Faites preuve d'humanité.
Nous n'avons aucune arme.</i>
A tous les vaisseaux,
préparez-vous à sauter. Cinq...
- Colonial One, répondez.
- Quatre...
- Que les Dieux de Kobol protègent ces âmes.
- Trois...
<i>J'ai des contacts Dradis.
Des cibles se dirigent vers nous.</i>
Deux...
- Je les vois aussi. Ce sont des Coloniaux ?
- Un...
- Oh mon Dieu, des Cylons !
- Zéro.
J'espère que vous pourrirez
en enfer pour ça !
Ça va ?
Ça va. C'est juste cet endroit.
Qu'est-ce qu'il a cet endroit ?
Depuis mon arrivée, quelque chose
dans l'air réveille mes allergies.
Vous me laissez toujours devant,
c'est votre formation militaire, non ?
Ne jamais tourner le dos
à un étranger, ce genre de chose ?
Suspicion et méfiance.
C'est la vie militaire, pas vrai ?
Vous êtes un trafiquant d'armes
philosophe, si j'ai bien compris ?
Je suis un observateur
de la nature humaine.
En y regardant de plus près...
l'humanité n'est pas une espèce
très fréquentable.
Il n'y a pas si longtemps
on en était encore à se battre
avec des massues comme des sauvages
pour un morceau de viande.
Les Cylons sont peut-être le châtiment
de Dieu pour tous nos péchés.
Et si Dieu s'était dit
qu'il avait fait une erreur...
et qu'il avait décidé de donner une âme
à une autre créature, comme les Cylons ?
Dieu n'a pas créé les Cylons,
c'est l'Homme qui l'a fait.
Et je suis certain qu'on n'a pas inclus
d'âme dans la programmation.
Allons-y.
Et si vous passiez un peu devant ?
Bien reçu.
Le chef dit qu'on en a
pour 3 heures minimum
pour charger toutes
les ogives dans nos entrepôts.
Selon le registre il y a
aussi 50 tonnes de quandal...
Aux postes de combat !
Aux postes de combat !
On a de multiples contacts
à travers l'orage vers l'ancrage.
- On dirait qu'il y a plus de 50 vaisseaux.
- Faites nous décoller.
Lancez les chasseurs d'alerte.
Déclenchez l'état d'alerte 1
sur tout le vaisseau.
- Préparez-vous au lanc...
- Attendez !
Attendez. Je reçois
des signaux coloniaux maintenant.
Confirmez ça.
Ne vous contentez pas
d'une identification amie.
Confirmé, mon commandant.
Les vaisseaux qui arrivent sont des nôtres.
Postes de combat :
Alerte annulée.
Le vaisseau de tête demande la permission
de nous accoster, Monsieur.
Ils disent...
Ils disent qu'ils ont
la Présidente des colonies à bord.
Autorisation accordée.
Nous sommes en train de
réarmer et réparer ce vaisseau.
On ne peut pas se permettre de vous donner
un seul homme pour s'occuper des réfugiés.
Nous avons 50 000 personnes là.
Certaines sont blessées.
La priorité doit être
donnée aux réfugiés.
Ma priorité est de préparer
ce vaisseau au combat.
Au cas où vous ne seriez pas
au courant, c'est la guerre.
Colonel...
la guerre est finie,
et nous avons perdu.
- C'est ce qu'on va voir.
- Oh, oui.
En attendant,
en tant que Présidente des colonies...
- je vous ordonne...
- Vous ne donnez pas d'ordres sur ce vaisseau !
- De fournir des hommes et du matériel !
- Attendez, mon colonel.
Donnez-nous au moins
deux nacelles de secours.
Nous ?
Nous avons 50 000 personnes là-bas.
Cinquante mille.
Certaines sont malades,
d'autres blessées.
Deux nacelles de secours,
mon colonel. Vous pouvez faire ça.
Parce que vous êtes le fils
du patron et qu'il sera...
tellement heureux
que vous soyez en vie.
D'accord. Deux nacelles.
Mais pas de personnel.
Vous allez les chercher
et vous les distribuez vous-même.
Et vous aurez tous quitté ce vaisseau
avant que nous resautions.
Allez vous présenter au pont d'envol.
Vous un êtes un pilote haut gradé maintenant.
Oui, Monsieur.
Sachant que cet endroit serait un musée, ils
auraient au moins pu nous donner une carte.
- Je pense que c'est par là.
- Oui ?
Oui.
Dès que l'autre entrepôt
sera chargé, je veux savoir...
- où est le commandant Adama.
- Très bien.
Dualla. Salut.
On est un peu perdus, à nouveau.
On doit aller au CIC.
Vous pourriez...
C'est par ici.
C'est par ici.
Je veux te présenter quelqu'un.
- un nouveau membre d'équipage.
- Il aura besoin de quartiers.
Je peux m'occuper de ça.
Je te croyais mort.
Tout comme je te croyais en taule.
C'est bon de se tromper.
Tu devrais être habituée depuis le temps.
Chacun son truc.
Alors... Comment avancent les réparations ?
Dans les temps.
Encore une heure et on pourra décoller.
- Je suppose que tu es le nouveau CAG.
- C'est ce qu'ils m'ont dit.
C'est bien !
C'est la dernière chose que je voudrais.
Je n'ai pas le manche assez long
pour ce boulot.
Je serai dans la salle de briefing...
de l'escadron.
Ton père sait que t'es encore en vie ?
Je le lui ferai savoir.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ici ?
Qu'est-ce que cet endroit me fait ?
Ça doit être vos allergies.
- Je n'ai pas d'allergies.
- C'est ce que je croyais aussi.
Mais vous avez des relais en silice
dans le cerveau.
ou quel que soit le nom de la chose
avec laquelle vous dites penser.
Ça se décompose pendant que nous parlons.
C'est l'orage, n'est-ce pas ?
Ça détruit quelque chose.
Vous avez découvert quelque chose
qui a un effet sur la technologie cylon.
C'est ça, n'est-ce pas ?
Et ici c'est un refuge.
C'est pour ça que vous avez amené la flotte ici.
L'effort final pour se cacher
d'une attaque Cylon, c'est ça ?
Ça ne suffira pas, Adama.
Je suis ici depuis des heures.
Quand ils vous auront trouvé...
Ça ne leur prendra pas longtemps
pour vous détruire.
Ils arriveront et repartiront
avant même d'avoir mal au crâne.
Peut-être.
Mais toi...
Tu ne le sauras jamais car tu seras mort
dans quelques minutes.
Tu ressens quoi ?
Si tu peux ressentir...
Je ressens plus que vous
ne pourrez jamais l'imaginer, Adama.
Mais je ne mourrai pas...
Quand ce corps mourra,
ma conscience sera transférée dans un autre.
Et quand ça se produira,
je pense que je dirai aux autres
votre position exacte.
Et là, je pense qu'ils viendront ici
et qu'ils vous tueront tous.
Et je serai là pour le voir.
Vous savez ce que je pense ?
Je pense que vous vous seriez transféré
hors d'ici depuis longtemps si vous aviez pu.
Je pense que les radiations de l'orage
ont bloqué votre connexion.
Vous n'irez nulle part.
Vous êtes coincé dans ce corps.
C'est sans importance. Tôt ou tard,
le jour viendra où vous ne pourrez plus fuir
les conséquences de vos actes.
En résumé vous dites que les Cylons
ont trouvé comment utiliser
votre programme de navigation
pour neutraliser nos vaisseaux.
Essentiellement, oui.
Je crois qu'ils utilisent le CNP
pour infecter vos chasseurs avec un virus,
ce qui permet aux Cylons
de prendre les commandes.
Mais vous voyez nous avons votre programme
de navigation CNP sur le Galactica.
Mais nos ordinateurs ne sont pas
en réseau donc,
Il n'a jamais été chargé dans
la mémoire centrale ou même testé.
C'est bien.
Vous ne devriez avoir aucun problème.
Néanmoins je devrais purger
toutes les références
qui apparaissent dans vos sauvegardes.
Je devrais aussi modifier
les nouveaux Vipers.
Voici la liste de contrôle
de l'ordinateur du CIC.
Ah, merci.
Ça doit être dur pour vous.
Que voulez-vous dire ?
Voir une chose que vous avez créée, détournée
et utilisée comme ça, ça doit être...
horrible.
- De la culpabilité ?
- Je me souviens de ce que tu me disais.
C'est ce que les petites gens ressentent quand
ils manquent d'excuses pour leur comportement.
C'est dur...
Je me sens...
responsable d'une certaine manière...
- de ce qui s'est passé.
- Mais ce n'est pas vrai.
C'est en partie pour ça que je suis
tombée amoureuse de toi.
Tu as une clarté d'esprit.
Tu ne t'embarrasses pas de la conscience,
de la culpabilité ou du regret.
J'imagine bien.
Essayez juste de vous dire
que ce n'est pas vraiment votre faute.
Je veux dire,
vous n'avez rien à voir avec tout ça.
Ce n'est pas comme si vous saviez
ce qu'ils allaient faire.
Ce n'est pas comme si tu savais que tu mentais.
Pas comme si tu violais la loi.
Pas comme si tu trompais les femmes.
Pas comme si le monde tombait en ruines...
Et que tout ce que tu pouvais penser,
- c'était à Gaius Baltar.
- Non, je sais. Je sais.
C'est exactement ce que vous dites.
Je sais.
D'accord.
Faites moi savoir
si vous avez besoin d'autre chose.
Tu sais, j'espère vraiment
que tu vas sortir d'ici vivant.
Je pense que nous pourrions avoir
un avenir ensemble.
Ouais, ça serait "spécial".
Tu n'as pas besoin d'être sarcastique,
Surtout quand j'essaye de t'aider.
Comment essaies-tu de m'aider ?
Comment ferais-tu ?
Tu ne vois rien ici qui te semble familier ?
Non, je devrais ?
Maintenant que tu le dis, je...
j'ai déjà vu quelque chose comme ça...
- Quelque part avant.
- Oui.
Dans ta malette.
Tu l'avais toujours avec toi.
Tu disais que c'était ton agenda électronique.
C'était un mensonge.
C'est...
C'est un appareil cylon.
Ce qui veut dire que...
- C'est toi ?
- Non.
Pas mon boulot.
- Alors c'est que...
- Dis-le.
Il y a un autre Cylon à bord de ce vaisseau.
- Tout va bien, docteur ?
- Oh, oui bien.
Je viens de finir d'effacer le programme
de défense de l'unité centrale.
J'allais le revérifier.
<i>Attention.
Appontage de vaisseau par l'arrière.</i>
<i>Je répète.
Appontage de Viper par l'arrière.</i>
Tu ne m'aides pas.
- Désolée, que puis-je faire ?
- Tu pourrais me dire ce que c'est.
Honnêtement, je ne sais pas.
- Ça n'a pas explosé.
- Pas encore...
Je ne fais que supposer.
Je dois les avertir. Oui... je...
Comment comptes-tu t'y prendre ?
"Oh, regardez, un appareil cylon."
"Vraiment ?"
"Comment savez-vous à quoi ressemble
un appareil cylon, docteur ?"
"Oh, j'ai oublié de vous dire..."
"Je connais bien leur technologie parce que
je couche avec un Cylon depuis deux ans."
- Je trouverai bien quelque chose.
- J'adore les surprises.
- En parlant de sexe...
- Je...
Je ne pense pas que ça soit
une bonne idée là, vraiment. Vraiment...
Pourquoi pas ?
Personne ne le saura.
Ce sera notre petit secret.
- Docteur.
- Oui !
Vous avez demandé un rapport sur le nombre
de vaisseaux civils ayant votre programme CNP.
Bien. Merci.
Vous allez bien ?
Vous semblez bien rouge...
Je vais bien, merci beaucoup.
Ok.
A quoi penses-tu ?
Je pense que quelqu'un d'autre
doit être un agent cylon.
Il ne semble pas être le genre. Et je ne me
rappelle pas l'avoir vu à une soirée cylon.
Très drôle...
C'est un civil.
Il vient de l'extérieur.
Et il est à bord de ce vaisseau
depuis des semaines
avec un accès
pratiquement illimité à cette pièce.
On a un problème.
Moral ?
Pratique.
Jusqu'ici à bord de ce vaisseau,
personne ne pensait
que les Cylons pouvaient nous ressembler.
C'est de pire en pire.
Maintenant les Cylons nous ressemblent.
Jusqu'à notre sang.
Vous réalisez ce que ça signifie ?
Ils peuvent être n'importe où...
N'importe qui...
J'ai eu le temps de réfléchir à ça.
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
Je ne sais pas.
- On en est où avec les armes ?
- L'entrepôt 2 est chargé.
Le 3 et le 4 le seront dans l'heure.
Autre chose...
Lee est vivant.
Commandant ?
Je suis désolé.
Je dois y aller.
Le médecin de bord dit qu'au premier abord
tout semble humain dans le corps de Leoben.
Organes internes, système lymphatique,
la totale.
L'échantillon de peau a révélé
un composé chimique unique
pendant l'incinération qui indique
une nature synthétique des échantillons.
- C'était un Cylon.
- Oui, en effet.
- Et maintenant nous avons un problème.
- Un gros.
Si les Cylons nous ressemblent,
alors n'importe qui peut être un Cylon.
C'est une possibilité terrifiante.
Nous avons besoin d'un moyen
de différencier l'humain du Cylon.
C'est là que vous intervenez.
Moi ?
La rumeur dit que vous êtes un génie.
Eh bien, je...
Je vais faire de mon mieux, Commandant.
Gardez ça pour vous pour l'instant.
Nous ne voulons pas de panique ou que des
gens accusent leur voisin d'être un Cylon
parce qu'il ne se brosse pas les dents
le matin.
Je serai très discret.
Tu comprends la mission.
Passer la tête hors de l'orage, regarder,
écouter les communications, revenir.
Pas d'héroïsme.
Une simple mission de reconnaissance.
- Regarde, écoute, reviens.
- Ne t'inquiète pas pour moi.
Mon goût pour l'héroïsme a disparu quand
j'ai combattu mon premier chasseur cylon.
Lee.
Zak a raté son examen de vol.
Quoi ?
Tout du moins il aurait dû le rater,
mais il l'a eu,
parce que je lui ai donné.
Sa technique était négligée et il n'avait
aucun talent pour voler mais je lui ai donné.
Parce que lui et moi...
Parce que je ressentais quelque chose
et que ça c'est immiscé dans mon travail.
Et j'ai pas pu le recaler.
Pourquoi tu me dis ça ?
Pourquoi... Pourquoi maintenant ?
C'est la fin du monde, Lee.
J'ai pensé que je devais confesser mes pêchés.
Prête !
- Halte ! Pas de mouvement brusque !
- Attendez une minute, les gars...
A genoux et croisez vos chevilles,
maintenant !
Attendez une minute là.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez ?
Mains derrière la tête.
S'il est un Cylon, pourquoi les radiations
de l'orage ne l'ont pas encore rendu malade ?
Je ne peux qu'émettre la théorie que
cela doit prendre un moment pour que
les effets de l'orage ne deviennent
apparents sur la physiologie cylon.
Quand il a rencontré Leoben,
Il était là depuis plusieurs heures.
Ça ne vous intéresse
pas que je ne sois pas un Cylon !?
La chose la plus futée que tu peux faire
maintenant serait de la fermer.
Vous êtes sûr ?
On ne peut jamais être sûr à 100%.
Mais les preuves semblent concluantes.
En gros, tout ce que j'ai fait se base
sur l'analyse du cadavre de Leoben
par votre docteur.
Puis j'ai fait discrètement le tour du CIC
en récupérant des cheveux
des personnes qui y travaillaient.
Je les ai soumis à une
analyse spectrale particulière
que j'expérimente depuis
un petit moment.
Puis j'ai fait un
sous-programme clinique
pour détecter des composés
chimiques synthétiques.
Ses échantillons ont été les seuls à s'avérer
synthétiques, comme vous pouvez le voir.
Je vous crois sur parole.
Et aussi simplement que ça, le Dr Baltar
invente l'Incroyable Détecteur de Cylon.
Messieurs, je comprends vos inquiétudes.
C'est une situation très difficile.
Mais vous avez besoin de prendre un
peu de recul, de respirer un bon coup,
et de bien regarder ce que vous
êtes en train de faire.
Je veux que tout le monde
sur ce vaisseau soit analysé.
- Aucune exception.
- Pas de problème.
Ecoutez, je ne sais pas pour les autres,
mais je sais que je suis humain.
Je suis de Moasis, c'est 2 ou
3 arrêts après Caprica City.
J'ai grandi au sud de la ville, et je suis
allé à l'Université de Kobol sur Geminon
J'ai étudié les relations publiques !
Au fait, je ne sais pas si c'est important ou pas,
mais tout à l'heure au CIC,
j'ai remarqué que M. Doral semblait...
je ne suis pas exactement sûr
de que ce qu'il faisait,
mais il semblait très intéressé
par ce dispositif étrange
sous la console Dradis.
- Quoi ?
- Ouais.
On devrait vraiment faire une copie de
ton schéma cérébral un de ces jours.
Quel dispositif ?
De quoi parlez-vous ?
Il ment. C'est un putain de menteur !
CIC, ici Tigh.
Isolez la console Dradis immédiatement.
- Ne l'écoutez pas !
- Personne ne s'en approche avant que j'arrive.
Seigneurs de Kobol,
dîtes-moi que je rêve.
- Vos ordres, mon colonel ?
- S'il bouge, tuez-le.
Vous avez mélangé les échantillons.
Je suis humain !
- Il n'est pas piégé, Monsieur.
- Bien. Enlevez-le.
Je ne vois rien dans les
registres d'entretien.
Mais je crois bien l'avoir
remarqué il y a une semaine.
Vous n'avez rien dit. Vous n'avez pas vérifié
un nouvel équipement qui apparaît au CIC.
Non, Monsieur, j'ai supposé
que ça faisait partie du musée.
- Désolé, Monsieur. Je n'ai pas d'excuses.
- Vous n'êtes pas le seul.
Nous aurions tous dû voir
une telle évidence sous notre nez.
En particulier le XO du vaisseau.
- Qu'est-ce que j'en fais, Monsieur ?
- Apportez-le au Dr Baltar.
Il a mon autorisation.
Il est devenu notre expert en Cylons.
Qu'il le prenne au labo, pour voir si
c'est un mouchard
ou quoi que soit d'autre.
En attendant, je veux que
chaque recoin du vaisseau soit fouillé
à la recherche de tout
équipement apparu depuis une semaine.
<i>Starbuck, ici le Galactica, vous
devriez approcher le 8e virage.</i>
<i>Bien reçu.</i>
<i>Je commence à perdre le contact radio.</i>
<i>J'entame le dernier tour.</i>
<i>Galactica, ici Starbuck.</i>
<i>J'ai atteint le seuil.</i>
Galactica, vous me recevez ?
<i>Galactica, vous me recevez ?</i>
C'est pas possible.
Repos.
On va encore être à cours de
fournitures médicales, Mme la Présidente.
Trois vaisseaux ont signalé
des problèmes de moteur
et veulent savoir quand ils recevront
l'assistance technique du Galactica.
C'est une bonne question.
Commandant, prenez un siège.
Je suis à vous dans une minute.
Continuez, Billy.
Le Capitaine de l'Astral Queen
veut que vous sachiez qu'il a
pas loin de 500 criminels sous
haute surveillance dans sa soute.
Ils allaient vers une station
pénale lors de l'attaque.
Oh, super.
Il veut savoir quoi faire d'eux.
Quoi faire d'eux ?
La nourriture et les fournitures
médicales étant ce qu'elles sont...
- Je pense qu'il envisage de...
- Non, non.
Non, on ne va pas commencer ça.
Ce sont encore des êtres humains.
Dites-lui que j'attends des rapports
quotidiens sur l'état des prisonniers.
Et qu'en cas de morts mystérieuses,
l'Astral Queen pourrait
se retrouver seul sans
la protection du Galactica.
- Oui, Madame la Présidente.
- Merci, Billy.
Vous prévoyez de faire un coup d'état ?
Quoi ?
De décréter la loi martiale ?
De prendre le pouvoir ?
Bien sûr que non.
Alors vous reconnaissez ma position
de présidente,
en accord avec les
Articles de la Colonisation ?
Mme Roslin, mon objectif
principal à l'heure actuelle
est de réparer le Galactica
et de retourner au combat.
Nous savons qu'il y a en ce
moment 50 000 réfugiés civils
qui n'ont aucune chance
sans la protection de votre vaisseau.
Nous sommes conscients
de la situation tactique.
Et je suis sûr que vous serez en
sécurité sur Ragnar après notre départ.
Après votre départ ?
Où allez-vous ?
Trouver l'ennemi. Nous sommes
en guerre. C'est ma mission.
Honnêtement, je ne sais pas pourquoi je
dois encore vous le dire
mais la guerre est finie.
Elle n'a pas encore commencé.
C'est de la folie.
- Vous voudriez fuir ?
- Absolument.
C'est la seule chose sensée à faire, fuir.
On quitte ce système
solaire sans se retourner.
- Pour aller où ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Un autre système, une autre planète.
Quelque part où les Cylons ne nous trouverons pas.
Fuyez si vous voulez.
- Ce vaisseau résistera et combattra.
- Je vais être directe avec vous.
La race humaine est sur
le point d'être anéantie.
Il nous reste 50 000 personnes, pas plus.
Maintenant, si nous comptons
survivre en tant qu'espèce
nous devons nous tirer d'ici
et commencer à faire des bébés.
Excusez-moi.
<i>Je n’ai pas compté précisément,
mais je dirais deux Vaisseaux-mère</i>
<i>avec 10 escadrons de chasseurs </i>
<i>et 2 détachements de
drones de reconnaissance</i>
<i>patrouillent le secteur.</i>
<i>- Starbuck, avez-vous été suivie ?
- Négatif. Aucun signe de poursuite.</i>
<i>Mais d'après leur déploiement,</i>
<i>je pense qu'ils nous attendent.</i>
Ramenez-la.
Merci, Starbuck.
Maintenez votre cap jusqu'à contact visuel,
et attendez les instructions.
<i>- Capitaine.
- Compris, Galactica.</i>
<i>Starbuck, terminé.</i>
Lieutenant Gaeta, restez s'il vous plait.
Comment diable nous ont-ils trouvés ?
Sans importance. Ils nous ont.
- Pourquoi ne viennent-ils pas ?
- Pourquoi le feraient-ils ?
Ils peuvent rester là et nous attendre.
Quelle différence pour eux,
c'est des machines.
C'est nous qui avons besoin de
nourriture, médicaments, carburant.
Je ne vais pas jouer leur jeu.
Je ne vais pas sortir pour
essayer de les affronter.
Peut-on planifier un saut
depuis l'intérieur de l'orage ?
Avec toutes ces interférences
EM qui brouillent le FTL ?
Je suis d'accord, Monsieur.
On ne devrait pas tenter le saut
- avant d'être sortis de l'orage.
- Va falloir être rapide.
Ils vont lancer tout ce
qu'ils ont au moindre signe.
On pointe notre nez juste
assez pour avoir un bon saut ?
Salut.
Salut.
Je vais retourner au transport.
Et pour les civils ?
Ils sont probablement en sûreté
pour le moment.
Vous voulez dire les laisser là ?
Les Cylons ne savent peut-être
même pas qu'ils sont là.
- Ils en ont sûrement juste après nous.
- C'est une sacrée supposition.
On ne peut pas tasser 50 000 hommes,
femmes et enfants à bord de ce vaisseau.
Je sais que c'est maladroit... Mais,
ce qu'il s'est passé dans le couloir...
Ouais. Je ne sais pas pourquoi j'ai fait ça.
Désolée.
Ce n’est pas ce que je propose.
C'est juste qu'on ne peut pas les laisser.
Ils devraient sauter avec nous.
Je ne vois pas comment faire
sans mettre le vaisseau en danger.
Un point de saut suffisamment
loin de la zone de combat...
Ah oui ? Et où s'arrête la zone de combat ?
Ils devraient commencer à faire des bébés.
- Est-ce un ordre ?
- Peut-être, d'ici peu.
Ok, on prend les civils avec nous.
On quitte ce système solaire,
et on n’y reviendra pas
- On fuit ?
- Cette guerre est terminée.
Nous avons perdu.
Mon père a raison.
Il est temps pour nous de sortir de là.
- Et ou allons-nous, commandant ?
- Le secteur Prolmar.
- C'est loin derrière la Ligne Rouge.
- Pouvez-vous préparer ce saut ?
- Je n'ai jamais préparé un saut si loin.
- Personne ne l'a fait. Pouvez-vous le préparer ?
- Oui, Monsieur.
- Faites-le, tout seul.
C'est une mauvaise position tactique.
On positionne le Galactica à 5 clicks devant.
Les civils nous suivront,
traverserons le seuil, et sauteront
pendant que nous tiendrons les Cylons à distance.
Dès que les civils auront sauté,
les chasseurs devront effectuer
un atterrissage d'urgence.
- Nous n'aurons pas beaucoup de temps
- Je leur dirai.
Je veux que tous mes pilotes reviennent.
Compris ?
Oui, Monsieur.
Je peux demander
ce qui vous a fait changer d'avis ?
Vous pouvez.
Et qu'est ce qu'on fait de notre prisonnier ?
Quoi ? Vous ne pouvez pas faire ça !
Vous ne pouvez pas me laisser mourir ici !
Vous avez de la nourriture, de l'eau,
tous les conforts de la maison.
Non, je vous en supplie.
Ne faites pas ça !
Je ne suis pas un Cylon !
Peut-être, mais nous ne pouvons
pas en prendre le risque.
Je ne suis pas un Cylon !
Quel genre de personnes êtes-vous ?
Ne me laissez pas !
<i>Postes de combat, postes de combat.</i>
<i>Condition 1 dans tout le vaisseau.
Je répète, postes de combat.</i>
<i>Condition 1 dans tout le vaisseau.</i>
La flotte est prête à sauter, Monsieur.
- Lieutenant Gaeta ?
- Oui, Monsieur ?
Communiquez à toute la flotte
les coordonnées finales.
Oui, Monsieur.
- Tenez-vous prêt à exécuter le plan de bataille.
- Monsieur.
Armes à pleine puissance.
Préparez-vous aux tirs de répression.
72 chasseurs cylons en approche.
Position à 1-2-0 point 4-8.
Tirs de répression.
Toutes les batteries, exécution.
Toutes les batteries, feu.
<i>Tous les ponts, activez
les relais d'énergie d'urgence.</i>
Périmètre établi.
- Lancez les Vipers
- Lancement des Vipers autorisé.
Rompez la formation,
manœuvres évasives.
Ne les laissez pas utiliser
leur ciblage automatique.
et surtout, restez en dehors
du champ de tir du Galactica !
Vipers en position.
Que les Vipers n'engagent
que les chasseurs,
et qu'ils nous laissent les vaisseaux-mère.
Exécution.
Galactica à tous les vaisseaux civils.
Commencez la séquence de saut.
Missiles en approche !
Apollo, tu me reçois ?
Allez les gars !
- On dirait que t'as cassé ton vaisseau, Apollo.
- J'ai fait pire... Mais merci.
Activez le panneau de contrôle des dommages.
Ils visent les hangars de pont. Nous devons
faire rentrer ces chasseurs à bord...
et rentrer les ponts
ou nous ne pourrons pas sauter.
Statut de la flotte.
Le dernier vaisseau civil est parti.
Rappelez tous les vaisseaux.
Sécurisez les ponts d'atterrissage.
Galactica à tous les vipers. Abandonnez
et rentrez. Je répète, rentrez.
Viper 1026, à bord.
1110 à bord.
- FTL ?
- Prêt !
- Vitesse lumière ?
- Prêt !
Tout est vert. Prêt pour le saut dès que
les hangars de pont seront bloqués.
Deux Vipers sont encore dehors, monsieur.
Starbuck et Apollo.
On ne peut pas affronter ces
vaisseaux-mère. Rentrez les ponts.
Je ne peux pas les laisser là.
- Passez-moi Starbuck.
- Monsieur.
Qu'est-ce que tu entends ?
Starbuck, ici le Galactica.
Qu'est-ce que tu entends ?
Quoi ?
Bonjour Starbuck.
Qu'est-ce que tu entends ?
Rien à part la pluie.
Attrape ton arme et ramène le chat.
Oui, monsieur !
Je rentre à la maison.
Je perds de la puissance.
J'y arriverai pas Starbuck.
- C'est fini, laisse-moi. Bordel, c'est un ordre !
- Lee, ferme-la et tiens-toi prêt.
Oh, non...
T'es pire que cinglée !
En plein dans le mille !
Allez...
On arrive un peu vite, tu crois pas ?
Non. Pas vraiment...
Allez...
- Ils arrivent.
- Accroche-toi !
- Ils sont à bord.
- Paré pour le saut.
Plate-forme d'atterrissage fermée.
Sautez !
Avec le cœur lourd, nous vous donnons
leurs corps, Seigneurs de Kobol,
avec la certitude que vous les soulagerez
de leurs fardeaux
et leur donnerez la vie éternelle.
Nous prions également pour que
vous baissiez les yeux vers nous maintenant
avec pitié et amour...
comme vous l'avez fait pour nos
ancêtres il y a tant d'années.
Comme vous nous avez guidés de Kobol
vers les 12 mondes,
maintenant nous espérons et prions que vous
nous guidiez vers un nouveau foyer.
Où nous pourrions commencer à vivre...
... à nouveau.
Ainsi soit-il.
Ainsi soit-il.
Ainsi soit-il.
Ainsi soit-il.
- Ainsi soit-il !
- Ainsi soit-il.
- Ainsi soit-il !
- Ainsi soit-il !
Ce sont eux les chanceux ?
C'est ce que vous pensez, n'est-ce pas ?
Nous sommes très loin de chez nous.
Nous avons sauté bien au-delà de la ligne rouge,
dans l'espace inconnu.
Provisions limitées, carburant limité,
aucun allié et maintenant...
aucun espoir ?
Il aurait peut-être mieux valu pour nous
mourir rapidement...
... dans les colonies avec nos familles,
au lieu de mourir ici lentement,
dans le vide de l'espace.
Où devons-nous aller ?
Que devons-nous faire ?
"La vie d'ici a commencé là-dehors."
Tels sont les premiers mots des Rouleaux Sacrés.
Ils nous ont été dictés par les Seigneurs de Kobol
il y a d'innombrables siècles de cela.
Et ils ont parfaitement expliqué que
nous ne sommes pas seuls dans cet univers.
Elosha...
Il y a une 13ème colonie
d'humains, n'est-ce pas ?
Oui.
Les rouleaux nous disent qu'une 13ème tribu
a quitté Kobol dans les Temps Anciens.
Ils ont voyagé loin et ont fait leur
demeure d'une planète appelée Terre,
qui tourne autour d'une lointaine étoile inconnue.
Elle n'est pas inconnue.
Je sais où elle se trouve !
La Terre.
Le secret le mieux gardé que nous ayons.
La position est connue seulement des
hauts commandants de la flotte
et nous avons decidé
de ne pas en informer le public
tant qu'il y avait une menace cylon sur nous.
Maintenant,
nous avons un refuge où aller.
Un refuge dont les Cylons
ne savent rien.
Ce ne sera pas un voyage facile.
Il sera long et ardu.
Mais je vous promets une chose...
en mémoire de ceux étendus ici, devant vous...
Nous la trouverons.
Et la terre...
deviendra notre nouveau foyer.
- Ainsi soit-il.
- Ainsi soit-il.
- Ainsi soit-il.
- Ainsi soit-il !
- Ainsi soit-il !
- Ainsi soit-il !
- Ainsi soit-il.
- Ainsi soit-il...
Rompez !
Repos.
J'essaye juste d'éviter un autre
voyage en taule, monsieur.
Lieutenant Thrace...
Kara...
Ce que vous avez fait dehors aujourd'hui
avec Lee Adama...
C'était...
une putain de leçon de vol.
Le commandant a toujours dit que vous étiez
le meilleur pilote qu'il n'ait jamais vu.
Aujourd'hui vous l'avez prouvé.
Maintenant...
A propos d'hier...
Pendant le jeu...
J'ai peut-être dépassé les limites
moi aussi.
Et je...
Je voulais juste dire...
Je suis désolé.
Vous n'avez rien à dire ?
- Permission de parler franchement, monsieur ?
- Accordée.
Vous êtes un bâtard.
Vous ne savez pas quand fermer
votre gueule, non ?
- Nous pouvons repartir sur de bonnes bases.
- Je ne veux pas de bonnes bases avec vous.
Vous êtes dangereux, vous savez pourquoi ?
Elle va être bonne...
Parce que vous êtes faible.
- Parce que vous êtes un ivrogne.
- Vous avez fini ?
- Oui, monsieur.
- Vous reprenez votre poste de pilote.
On verra combien de temps ça durera...
Entrez.
Premièrement, je suppose que je devrais vous
remercier pour avoir décidé de nous emmener.
Écoutez, vous aviez raison.
J'avais tort... Oublions ça...
D'accord.
La Terre n'existe pas.
Vous avez tout inventé.
Le Président Adar et moi avons parlé une fois
des légendes entourant la Terre.
Il ne savait rien d'un endroit secret
au sujet de la Terre.
Et si le président ne savait rien...
Comment auriez-vous pu le savoir ?
Vous avez raison.
La Terre n'existe pas...
Ce n'est qu'une légende.
Alors pourquoi ?
Parce que ça ne suffit pas de seulement vivre.
Il faut vivre pour quelque chose.
Ce sera pour la Terre.
Ils ne vous pardonneront jamais.
Peut-être...
Mais en attendant...
Je nous ai donné à tous une raison de survivre.
Et ne disiez-vous pas que c'est
la chose la plus importante...
La survie de la race humaine ?
- Qui d'autre est au courant ?
- Personne.
D'accord...
Je garderai votre secret.
- Mais je veux quelque chose en retour.
- J'écoute.
Si cette civilisation doit fonctionner,
elle aura besoin d'un gouvernement.
Un gouvernement civil dirigé par
le Président des Colonies.
Ainsi vous serez responsable de la flotte.
Les décisions militaires restent à moi.
Oui.
Alors je vais y penser, Madame la Présidente.
<i>- Je ferais mieux de reprogrammer.
- Ok.</i>
Votre fuite est au mieux temporaire.
Nous vous retrouverons.
Ouais, vous pouvez essayer...
l'univers est grand...
- Tu n'as pas parlé du vrai problème, bien sûr.
- Oui, oui...
Il peut y avoir des agents cylons vivant parmi
nous, attendant de frapper à tout moment.
Certains peuvent même ignorer
qu'ils sont des cylons.
Ils peuvent être des agents dormants
programmés pour agir
en parfaits êtres humains
jusqu'à leur activation.
S'il y a un Cylon à bord de ce vaisseau,
nous le trouverons.
Nous ?
Tu n'es pas de leur côté, Gaius.
Je ne suis du côté de personne.
Et demain, je mettrai en place une
patrouille de combat autour de la flotte.
Bien, passe une bonne nuit toi aussi.
Je...
Pourquoi on ne garderait pas ça
pour une autre fois, fils ?
<i>En fait, je suis l'assistant du président.</i>
<i>- Impressionnant...
- Ouais.</i>
Dualla !
Ta-daa...
- C'est bien d'être petite.
- Et voilà, Chef.
C'est bien d'être petite.
Bonne nuit, Commandant.
Bonne nuit, Capitaine.
"Il y a seulement 12 modèles de Cylon."
Nous devons sortir de cet orage.
Les radiations affectent nos relais en silice.
- Où sont-ils partis ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- Ils ont préparé un grand saut.
- Nous ne pouvons pas les laisser partir.
Malheureusement, je suis d'accord.
Si nous les laissons partir,
ils reviendront un jour et se vengeront.
- C'est dans leur nature.
- Nous n'avons pas le choix.
Cela pourrait nous prendre plusieurs
décennies pour les trouver.
Ne t'inquiète pas. Nous les trouverons.
A vos ordres.

Tu me dis que tu es une machine ?
Un robot ?
Tu savais que je voulais accès
à l'ordinateur de la défense.
As-tu idée de ce qu'ils vont me faire
s'ils le découvrent ?
Couche toi !
Ce vaisseau vient d'être averti d'une
attaque des Cylons contre nos planètes.
A partir de maintenant,
nous sommes en guerre.
Ok, on peut prendre
trois personnes de plus.
Donne lui ma place.
J'ai décidé que tu étais
une expression de mon subconscient
durant mon état éveillé.
Donc je ne suis que dans ta tête ?
Il pourrait y avoir des agents Cylons
parmi nous.
Certains pourraient même ne pas savoir
qu'ils sont des Cylons.
Des agents endormis,
programmés pour parfaitement imiter
un humain jusqu'à activation.
Encore une minute.
Dieu a un plan pour toi Gaius.
Il a un plan pour tout
et pour tout le monde.
Gaius, tu m'écoutes au moins ?
Passagers, plus que 30 sec.
... l'âge.
- Faites ça après le saut, c'est bon.
- Oui Mme le Président.
Tu dois bien croire en quelque chose.
Je crois en un monde
que je puisse comprendre.
Un univers rationnel,
explicable par des moyens rationnels.
Je t'aime, ça, ça n'est pas rationnel.
Non...
Mais...
Tu n'est pas rationnelle.
Tu n'es même pas réellement là.
Et moi non plus.
Mme le Président, Mmes, Mrs,
nos 33 minutes se terminent.
Préparez-vous pour un saut
hyperluminique. Merci.
On se rapproche de plus en plus
de la limite Billy, non ?
Les pilotes ont eu à reconstruire tout
le système informatique à nouveau.
Pourquoi les Cylons viennent
toutes les 33 min ?
Pourquoi pas 34 ou 35 ?
- Cally.
- Quoi ?
Ferme-la.
15 secondes.
Monsieur, saut 2-3-7 en cours.
53 vaisseaux ont sauté, 10 signalent
des problèmes avec leur moteur,
y compris Colonial One.
On ralentit.
Peut-être que cette fois...
Nous avons des contacts.
- Ce sont les Cylons.
- Bon sang !
Pas cette fois, peut-être la prochaine.
Donnez-nous une idée
pour le prochain cycle.
Mesdames et Messieurs,
les Cylons ont réapparu.
Cependant notre moteur hyperluminique
fonctionne et nous allons sauter.
Ça fait 5 jours.
Il y a des limites pour le corps humain,
pour l'esprit humain.
Des tolérances qu'on
ne peut pas dépasser.
Ce sont des faits.
Des faits brutaux.
Tout le monde a des limites.
Vous connaissez la procédure,
restez en formation.
Tenez-les éloignés des vaisseaux et ne
dépassez pas la limite de récupération.
C'est quoi ce bruit dans les canons ?
Vous avez un voyant allumé !
La proue tribord est touchée.
Attente des rapports d'avarie.
Le vaisseau-mère lâche ses chasseurs.
Colonial One est prêt à sauter.
Tous les vaisseaux civils sont partis,
y compris Colonial One.
Récupérez les chasseurs.
Préparez le saut.
Atterrissage de combat !
- Tous les chasseurs à bord.
- Exécutez le saut.
Saut 2-3-7 effectué.
Tous les vaisseaux civils sont là.
Redémarrez le chrono et lancez les
préparations pour le prochain saut.
Le chrono est relancé.
33 minutes,
maintenant.
Vous avez 32 minutes les gars.
Tu sais que tu n'es pas en sécurité.
Bien sûr que je le sais.
Les Cylons nous pourchasseront encore.
Tout comme les 237 autres fois.
C'est vrai, il y a des limites.
- Vous allez finir par faire une erreur.
- Et vous nous tuerez tous.
Je le sais, mais...
pas dans les 33 minutes à venir.

130,35 heures sans sommeil pour l'équipage.
Je veux essayer quelque chose
de nouveau cette fois.
Diviser la flotte en 6 groupes.
Et sauter 2 fois de plus.
Au 4ème saut on se retrouve
aux coordonnées prévues.
24 sauts à organiser,
nous allons casser la navigation
à calculer un saut toutes les 33 mn.
Pousse-toi de ma veste.
- Tu vas manger ça ?
- Plus maintenant.
Les atterrissages de combats sont
à nouveau à l'ordre du jour, donc...
revérifiez votre train d'atterrissage
avant de...
Bon, vous avez tous fait ça 237 fois.
Vous savez quoi faire.
Pas d'erreurs,
et on arrivera à 238.
Bonne  chance
et soyez prudents là dehors.
Ne jamais oublier...
Fais moi une faveur, dis au Capitaine
Apollo qu'il me doit une aile.
Compris.
Kelly, il y en a 3.
Je sais qu'il y en a 3.
Tu peux revérifier STP ?
Ouais.
Est-ce quelqu'un
va commencer à travailler ?
Hé, on dormira quand on sera morts.
Allez.
Boomer,
tu  as entendu la nouvelle ?
Les Cylons nous ressemblent maintenant.
- Champ primaire ?
- Champ primaire 289 unités.
Un marine a dit à l'un des pilotes
qu'on avait abandonné un gars à Ragnar
parce que le XO pensait
que c'était un Cylon.
Tu sais quoi ?
Je m'en fiche !
Voyant allumé sur le propulseur 4.
Va voir s'il est bloqué !
- Ok.
- Ok...
T'es un peu dure avec ton nouveau ECO.
Il n'est pas mon ECO.
C'est un réfugié de Triton avec qui on m'a mise.
Et je ne t'ai rien demandé.
- Helo est mort, Sharon.
- Je ne t'ai pas demandé ça non plus.
Je suis désolée...
- Quelle colonie ?
- Sagittaria.
- Combien vous en avez ?
- 5 251 de Sagittaria au dernier compte.
On ne peut pas encore
transmettre de photos.
Vous pouvez me laisser m'en occuper
ou la mettre sur le tableau dehors.
Merci.
Suivant.
Quelle colonie ?
J'ai le décompte de la population,
Mme le Président.
Comment avons-nous perdu 300 personnes ?
Il y a eu quelques surestimations,
des morts suite aux blessures,
et des disparus suite
à la dernière attaque.
Tu veux des enfants, Gaius ?
Laisse-moi y réfléchir une minute.
Non.
La procréation est l'un
des commandements de Dieu.
Vraiment ?
Je suis sûr qu'un jour,
si tu es une gentille Cylon,
il te récompensera
avec un petit bébé grille-pain.
Je veux avoir un enfant avec toi Gaius.
Tu n'es pas sérieuse ?
- C'est le docteur Amarak.
- Pardon ?
Je suis désolé de vous déranger
pendant que vous discutiez.
Vous disiez ?
Je disais que le docteur Amarak
a demandé à parler au Président.
- Docteur Amarak, je vois.
- Vous le connaissez ?
- Tu as toujours été multitâche comme ça ?
- Oui, oui.
Je travaillais avec lui
au ministère de la Défense.
Ça dit qu'il a d'importantes informations
sur la façon dont les Cylons ont pu
totalement détruire nos défenses.
Y a-t-il une chance
qu'il sache pour nous ?
Pourquoi vous ? Peut-être devrais-je
lui parler si vous êtes occupée ?
En fait...
Je crois qu'il veut parler
directement au Président.
Ça a l'air urgent.
Ça doit être très très important.
Peut-être à propos d'un traître
dans l'entourage du Président.
Pas le temps avant le prochain saut.
Faites-le venir pendant le prochain cycle.
Merci Docteur.
Je dirais que tu as un sérieux problème.
Si je peux aider...
Il est bizarre, non ?

6ème JOUR SUR CAPRICA.
Voilà.
Encore 12 cas d'épuisement nerveux.
Ça en fait 61.
Dites au doc de commencer
à leur donner des stimulants.
Ça les remettra en selle.
Les pilotes aussi.
- Rapport de terrain.
- Tous les trois cycles.
Ça va finir par nous retomber dessus.
- Il y a trop de travail mais il faut le faire.
- Rapport de terrain.
- Je l'ai déjà signé.
- Oui Monsieur. Désolée.
Communiqué 2 du président.
- Ce sont mes 10 mn ou les tiennes ?
- Les tiennes.
J'ai pris les miennes la dernière fois.
On se revoit en salle
de commandement.
Je croyais que c'étaient vos 10 mn.
Le patron est tellement fatigué qu'il
ne se souvient plus que c'est son tour.
Hey...
Tu... euh...
Tu as vu la note du XO ?
Je l'ai vue. Pas question.
- Kara, tout le m...
- Je ne vole pas sous stimulants.
Ça affecte les réflexes,
les temps de réaction.
- Allez Kara...
- Pourquoi on se dispute pour ça ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- Moi non plus. Tu es le CAG,
- agis en tant que tel.
- Ça veut dire quoi ça ?
Ça veut dire que tu agis encore comme
le meilleur ami de tout le monde.
Nous ne sommes pas amis,
tu es le CAG.
"Soyez prudents là dehors" ?
Notre job n'est pas d'être prudent,
c'est de dégommer les Cylons du ciel.
"Bonne chasse",
c'est ça que tu nous dis.
Et maintenant un de tes pilotes fait
l'enfant et refuse de prendre ses pilules.
Donc, soit elle dit "Oui, Monsieur"
et obéît à un ordre direct,
soit tu lui mets une tarte
et tu traînes son cul à l'infirmerie
et tu lui fais bouffer ces pilules.
Je suis content
de travailler pour toi maintenant.
T'as raison...
Travailler pour moi...
Est-ce que je dois te
"mettre une tarte", Lt ?
Non,  Monsieur,
je vais prendre mes pilules.
Oh... Parfait.
Continue comme ça.
- Oui, Monsieur.
- Pilotes, rendez-vous au briefing.
Quoi ?
Saut 2-3-8 effectué.
Démarrez le chrono.
33 minutes...
Maintenant.
Tous les vaisseaux civils présents et...
Rectification.
Un vaisseau civil est manquant
et non répertorié, Monsieur.
- Lequel ?
- Le Olympic Carrier.
Vaisseau de transport de passagers.
L'a-t-on laissé derrière ?
Je pense avoir répertorié
tous les vaisseaux civils avant de par...
Vous pensez ?
Vous l'avez fait ou pas ?
Ils ne se sont pas connectés.
On peut les avoir laissés derrière.
Combien de personnes à bord ?
1 345 âmes.
Vous me dites qu'on a peut-être laissé
plus de 1 300 personnes aux Cylons ?
Ce n'est peut-être pas sa faute,
Monsieur.
Ce peut une erreur de navigation,
un saut aux mauvaises coordonnées,
les Cylons ont pu les détruire
avant qu'ils sautent...
15 autres choses ont pu arriver. Le fait
est qu'on ne sait pas ce qui s'est passé !
Oui, nous sommes fatigués.
Oui, il n'y a pas de répit.
Oui, les Cylons reviennent sans arrêt,
cycle après cycle après cycle...
Et oui, on attend toujours de nous
qu'on fasse notre job !
Nous faisons des erreurs,
des gens meurent.
Nous ne sommes plus nombreux.
Continuez.
Crise suivante.
- Liste des causes.
- Oui.
Mais d'abord, où est ce docteur qui
devrait être à bord ? Quel est son nom ?
- Docteur Amarak.
- Oui.
Il était sur l'Olympic Carrier.
Dieu veille sur toi, Gaius.
L'univers est un système
vaste et complexe.
Des coïncidences...
des évènements inattendus et arrangeants
sont prévisibles, ça fait partie du plan.
Le Docteur Amarak
était une menace pour toi.
Maintenant il a disparu.
La logique veut qu'il y ait un lien.
Un lien peut-être.
Mais pas Dieu.
Il n'y a pas de Dieu.
Ni de dieux. Singulier ou pluriel.
Pas d'hommes invisibles, ou de femmes,
peu importe,
dans le ciel ayant un intérêt personnel
pour la vie de Gaius Baltar.
Fais attention. Ce que Dieu donne,
Dieu peut le reprendre.
15 secondes.
Peut-être cette fois ?
- Travis ?
- Pas de contact ennemi.
Laissez tourner le chrono.
T'en dis quoi ?
J'en dis qu'on attend.
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.
132,15 heures sans sommeil pour l'équipage.
Passez-moi le président.
Pourquoi cette fois ?
Est-ce quelque chose
que vous avez fait ?
On avait un nouveau plan, mais on n'a pas
encore eu le temps de le mettre en place.
Nous avons perdu le Olympic Carrier
au dernier saut.
Vous pensez qu'il y a un rapport ?
C'est possible.
- Vous êtes toujours là ?
- Oui.
Que fait-on maintenant ?
J'ai des gens qui sont à cran ici.
On va passer en Condition 2.
Nous allons tirer avantage de ce répit.
- Que les gens se reposent.
- Oui.
Et combien de temps resterons-nous
en Condition 2 ?
Jusqu'à ce que je sois sûr
qu'ils ne reviendront pas.
C'est une décision militaire.
Bien sûr. Je sais que vous avez raison.
Et j'appuie votre décision.
Dites à vos hommes à quel point
je suis reconnaissante
du travail qu'il font.
Remerciez-les pour moi.
Merci Madame le Président.
Contactez Apollo.
Dites-lui d'organiser une patrouille
de combat autour de la flotte.
Ordres aux autres pilotes
d'atterrir immédiatement.
Ok les gars, vous avez entendu
les ordres.
Boomer, Starbuck, vous êtes avec moi.
On va faire le premier quart.
Je veux que tous les autres
sur le Galactica et dans leurs pieux.
Rotations de 3 heures.
C'est pas que je sois pas honorée de passer
les 3 prochaines heures dans mon cockpit,
- mais...
- Mais pourquoi toi ?
Devine.
Parce que je suis sous médicaments ?
C'est ça. Cette patrouille
a une stimulation de 100 %.
Quelqu'un d'autre a des putains
de fourmis derrière le globe oculaire ?
Et pour toi Boomer ?
Le doc m'a dit que tu résistais mieux
que n'importe qui d'autre.
- Je suis fatiguée comme tout le monde.
- J'ai pas remarqué.
- Ça doit être toi le Cylon.
- T'as envie que je te botte les fesses ?
Mettons-nous en patrouille
avant que quelqu'un soit blessé.
- Suivez-moi.
- Bien reçu, Apollo.
"Quelques heures de repos" ça semble
tellement doux maintenant.
Tu le mérites.
La vérité c'est que...
tout ceci me fait me sentir plus vivant
que durant ces 11 dernières années.
On dirait en tout cas.
C'est bon de te voir
sans cette tasse dans la main.
Commence pas...
Mais  je sais qu'il y a beaucoup de gens
à bord de ce vaisseau
qui souhaiteraient que
tu ne te sentes pas aussi bien.
Si l'équipage ne déteste pas son XO,
c'est qu'il ne fait pas son boulot.
De plus, ça donne l'air sympa au patron.
- J'ai toujours eu l'air sympa.
- Regarde dans un miroir.
- Sérieusement.
- Monsieur ?
C'est une chose de pousser l'équipage,
c'en est une autre de le briser.
Contact radar ! Cap 3.4.8 sur 1.2.0.
Un vaisseau.
Nous recevons un signal d'identification.
C'est l'Olympic Carrier, Monsieur.
- C'est confirmé ?
- Oui, Monsieur.
Que les Dieux soient remerciés.
Stations de combat.
Passez la flotte en Condition 1.
Je veux que tous les hommes et les Vipers
soient prêts dans les tubes.
- Monsieur Gaeta !
- Monsieur ?
Redémarrez le chrono.
33 minutes.
- J'espère que tu as tort.
- Moi aussi.
Non, non, non...
C'est pas logique.
S'ils ont été laissés derrière, pourquoi
les Cylons ne les ont-ils pas détruits ?
Mais pourquoi est-ce
qu'ils réapparaissent ?
C'est le châtiment de Dieu
pour ton manque de foi.
Ça, c'est vraiment super !
Une explication plus logique
et constructive, s'il te plaît.
Très bien...
L'Olympic Carrier a été infiltré
par des agents Cylons.
Ils pistaient ce vaisseau
depuis le début.
Non.
Alors ça signifie...
Logiquement, pour que
tu puisses survivre...
l'Olympic Carrier doit être détruit.
Olympic Carrier, ici Raptor 478,
identification Boomer.
Je vous ai en contact visuel.
Veuillez répondre en canal ouvert.
Raptor 478, ici l'Olympic Carrier.
Nous vous avons en contact visuel.
Merci aux dieux de Kobol,
nous sommes soulagés de vous voir.
Bien reçu Olympic Carrier.
Pouvez-vous dire où vous étiez ?
Nous avions un problème avec le moteur
hyperluminique. Il fallu 3 heures pour réparer.
Que Boomer lui demande comment
ils ont échappé aux Cylons.
Olympic Carrier, Boomer.
Comment avez-vous échappé aux Cylons ?
Ils se rapprochaient alors que vous tous
sautiez, je pensais qu'on était morts.
Et ils sont partis. Je suppose
que quelqu'un devait veiller sur nous.
Bien compris.
Autre chose Boomer.
J'ai un docteur Amarak à bord
qui prétend devoir parler au Président
d'un sujet important. Il me rend fou.
Olympic Carrier,
pouvez-vous être un peu plus explicite ?
Non. Il parle d'un traître
et ne veut pas en dire plus.
Mme le Président, je recommande de couper
toute communication avec ce vaisseau.
Pourquoi ?
Excusez mon impolitesse mais...
Réveillez-vous !
L'Olympic Carrier vole encore parce que
les Cylons les ont laissés survivre.
Ils pistent ce vaisseau depuis le début !
Il doit y avoir un agent Cylon à bord !
Calmez-vous !
Répétez-moi ça.
S'il vous plaît, je vous implore
de m'écouter.
Coupez les com radio avec ce vaisseau avant
qu'ils ne diffusent sur toutes les fréquences
un autre virus informatique pour affecter
nos vaisseaux avant de nous faire sauter.
Commandant Adama,
êtes-vous sur la ligne ?
Coupez le haut-parleur,
passez-moi sur la ligne.
Oui, Mme le Président. Je suis enclin
à être d'accord avec le Dr Baltar.
Bien, parce que moi aussi.
- Remercions les dieux que vous soyez là.
- Les dieux n'ont rien à voir avec ça.
Boomer, Galactica.
Vos ordres sont de brouiller toutes
les transmissions de l'Olympic Carrier.
Plus aucun contact audio n'est autorisé.
Bien compris Galactica.
Boomer, Galactica.
Ordre de transmettre message
par signal lumineux.
Début du message.
"Maintenez la position actuelle.
"N'approchez pas, je répète,
n'approchez pas la flotte avant nouvel ordre."
Fin du message.
J'ai un mauvais pressentiment
sur l'issue de tout ceci.
Moi aussi.
Si ce vaisseau représente une menace,
nous devons éliminer cette menace.
- Je ne crois pas qu'ils ont eu le message.
- Ouais, j'ai vu.
Boomer, romps le silence radio
sur mon ordre.
Préviens-les de stopper
leurs moteurs immédiatement.
Je suggère d'évacuer les passagers
et de détruire le vaisseau.
C'est la solution s'ils pistent le vaisseau.
Et si c'était un passager qu'ils pistent ?
Olympic Carrier,
Olympic Carrier.
Vous avez ordre de stopper vos moteurs
immédiatement. Accusez réception.
- Apollo, ils ne répondent pas.
- Tu utilises le même canal ?
Oui. On dirait
qu'il n'y a plus personne.
Starbuck, tire une salve
à proximité de leur proue.
Oui, bien compris.
Boomer, préviens Galactica
qu'on a un problème ici.
Commandant, message de Boomer.
L'Olympic Carrier se dirige droit
sur nous. Ils refusent de s'arrêter.
Galactica, ils ne répondent toujours pas
et continuent de se diriger vers la flotte.
- Demandons instructions.
- Ordre à la flotte de faire le saut 2-4-0.
Amenez-nous entre la flotte
et ce vaisseau.
Contact radar. Correction :
multiples contacts radar.
Ce sont les Cylons.
Cylons, en trajectoire d'interception.
Ils seront à portée de tir dans...
2 minutes.
Alarme radiologique !
- Alarme radiologique.
- D'où ?
Du Olympic Carrier, Monsieur.
Ils ont des ogives à bord.
Mme le Président, nous devons détruire
l'Olympic Carrier, immédiatement.
- Il y a 1 300 personnes sur ce vaisseau.
- On n'en est pas sûrs.
Les Cylons peuvent déjà
les avoir capturés.
Elle ne va pas le faire.
- Elle doit le faire !
- Ce n'est pas sa décision, Gaius.
Non ?
C'est le choix de Dieu.
Il veut que tu te repentes.
Ecoutez, il n'y a plus le choix
maintenant. C'est eux ou nous.
Repens toi pour devenir un saint.
Accepte son amour en toi, il le veut.
Je me repens...
Je me repens !
Je me repens.
Faites-le.
Nous avons de nouveaux ordres.
Ils nous demandent de...
détruire l'Olympic Carrier
et de retourner sur Galactica.
C'est un vaisseau civil.
Un vaisseau civil avec des ogives.
Je ne vois personne à l'intérieur.
Et vous ?
Les Cylons vont arriver.
Si on doit le faire, faisons-le.
Starbuck,
en formation avec moi.
On se met derrière lui.
Et si on a tort ?
Lee, arrêtes-ça !
Lee ?
Ok, feu sur mon ordre.
Pas question, Lee.
Arrêtes-ça !!!
Feu.
Vous êtes vivant ?
Agaton, Karl C. Lieutenant
de la flotte coloniale PK...
- 78934...
- Je sais qui vous êtes, Helo.
Tout va bien, je suis une amie.
Sharon ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Tu peux marcher ?
Oui, je pense.
- Que fais-tu là ?
- Remue-toi.
Monsieur.
Fiston...
J'ai donné l'ordre.
Je suis le responsable.
J'ai appuyé sur la gâchette.
C'est moi qui le suis.
Madame le Président.
Je suis désolée.
Vous disiez ?
24 heures et aucun Cylon.
Comment saviez-vous
que c'était le bon choix ?
Le bon choix ?
- Désolée Billy, j'aimerais être seule.
- Bien sûr.
Qu'y a-t-il ?
- J'ai le dernier décompte.
- Combien à soustraire ?
En fait, vous devez en ajouter un.
Un bébé est né ce matin
sur le Rising Star.
Un garçon.
- Un bébé ?
- Oui.
Merci.
Merci à Lama pour avoir comblé les trous

Ce vaisseau constitue une menace pour nous,
nous devons éliminer cette menace.

Non Sir, c'est juste que...
c'est le matin, Sir.
- Quel heure est-il ?
- 5:45.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Où est passé le reste ?
Attention. Le Colonial One arrivera dans 30 minutes.
L'escorte d'honneur au Rapport.

Faites-le !
Je n'arrête pas de penser à l' Olympic Carrier.
C'était il y a trois jours,
Changer l'Histoire dans ces circonstances,
serait le souhait des historiens.
Mais n'avons-nous pas une responsabilité ?
Je veux dire que...
En tant que dirigeants, notre devoir n'est-il pas
de remettre en question nos actes ? Pour...
Je ne suis pas sûr que les décisions
que nous avons prises étaient les bonnes.
Nous avons fait ce que nous avions à faire, fils.
Un homme assume la responsabilité de
ses actions. Bonnes ou mauvaises.
Il accepte les conséquences,
ou apprend à vivre avec
chaque jour.
Colonial One, Galactica.
Poursuivez jusqu'à l'amarrage Omega.
Contacter le C.I.C lorsque
vous aurez finis l'arrimage.
Reçu, Galactica.
Excusez moi, Madame la Présidente,
Nous sommes arrivés...
Ne me dites pas que nous devrons
passer par ça à chaque fois que je monte sur ce vaisseau.
Non Madame. Mais ils rendent toujours les
honneurs au débarquement. C'est le protocole.
Les militaires, ils adorent leur protocole.
Je suis sûr que si ils savaient que vous
n'aimez pas ça ils seraient disposés à-
Non, laissez Adama faire
sonner les trompettes.
Peut-être fait-il ça pour se sentir plus à l'aise,
et peut-être que si il se sent plus à l'aise
il se montrera un peu plus conciliant.
C'est rusé.
Ce n'est pas de la ruse, c'est de la politique.
Je crois que je vais me lasser
de cette tenue,
surtout qu'il ne m'en reste que 3
pour le reste de ma vie.
Elle est bien.
Bien ?
Elle semble... superbe
Vous ne savez rien à propos des femmes,
n'est-ce pas ?
- Allons y ?
- Soyons présidentiel.
Je suis certaine de parler au nom de toute la flotte
en disant "Merci".
Sans votre extraordinaire dévouement,
vos infatigables efforts... Vos sacrifices.
aucun d'entre nous ne serait là, aujourd'hui.
Je suis fière de servir comme votre présidente.
Merci.
Continuez.
Sir, le Vergon Express se positionne sur notre flanc
ils se maintiennent en attendant la cargaison.
Merci beaucoup, Shea. Surveillez l'horloge
et procédez à la cargaison.
Oui, sir.
- Par là, s'il vous plait.
- Merci.
- Euh, 'scusez moi chef, puis-je vous parler ?
- Oui, juste une seconde.
Faites le. Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Il - il y a un problème.
Oh, oui sir, nous l'avons terminé.
Nous lui avons tout listé pour
passer une inspection.
Vergon Express, Galactica, nous
avons un contact visuel.
Maintenez votre cap et vitesse actuelle.
Reçu Galactica, nous maintenons cap et vitesse actuels.
Activation des poutrelles
de stabilisation 24A à 28C.
Le système de recyclage d'eau du Galactica
approche les 100% d'efficacité.
Par une conception délibérée, il n'y a pas
une goutte d'eau qui soit gaspillée à bord.
- Nous avons assez d'eau pour plusieurs
années avant un réapprovisionnement.
- Je vois.
Beaucoup de vaisseaux comme le Vergon Express,
ne sont pas fait pour de longs voyages.
- Au pire, nous devrons les réapprovisionner périodiquement.
- Bien.
Quoi que ce soit, quoi que ce soit
nous allons régler ça, ok ?
Maintenant, dis moi ce qu'il s'est passé.
En ce moment même, il y à 6 détonateur G-4,
qui ont disparu... de l'armurerie du pont 15.
Commandant, nous sommes
prêts à transférer l'eau.
E xcusez-moi.
- Comment ça se passe ?
- Oh ! Je me sens comme un...
- guide touristique.
- guide touristique.
- On le remarque, eh ?
- Bah, c'était une enseignante...
Elle voit probablement ceci comme
une grande expérience éducative.
Il pense que je suis complètement idiote,
n'est-ce pas ?
Quoi ? Non, Madame, non.
Ca ne fait rien.
Pourquoi  est-ce que tu me le dis ?
Ce que tu veux me dire sur des détonateurs manquant
vas le dire maître d'armes, tout de suite.
- Je le sais...
- Sharon, Sharon
Tu ne peux pas prendre ça à la légère !
Je ne le prends pas à la légère, Ok ?!
Je n'ai rien dit
parce qu'ils vont supposer que
c'est moi qui les ai pris !!!
Comment vont les choses ?
- Elles vont bien.
- Bien.
Tu parais bien...
J'... J'aime beaucoup ta... coiffure.
Ma coiffure !?
Je ne connais rien aux femmes.
Madame la Présidente,
si je peux me permettre ?
je pense que vous devriez savoir
que mon père...
- eh bien, toute cette cérémonie était son idée.
- Je sais.
Vous pensez qu'il apprécie ?
En fait il déteste le protocole,
en grande pompe, et tout ça.
Vraiment ?
Il fait un geste. Pour que vous vous
sentiez... comme la Présidente.
Ouvrez les valves 3 et 5.
J'ai pris ce détonateur G-4
Je l'ai remis à sa place...
et je suis retournée à mes quartiers.
Bien...
Tu sais quoi ?Tu sais quoi ?
Ce n'est pas ta faute.
Il est évident que quelqu'un essaie
de te piéger. C'est sûr.
Tu ne sais pas comment tu es arrivée là
où tu t'es réveillée, on t'a droguée...
ou bien manipulée ou... je ne sais quoi d'autre.
Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire ?
Si... je dis ce qui s'est passé
on va penser que je suis un agent Cylon.
Ne le fais pas ! Non, non, non !
Pourquoi ils penseraient ça ?
C'est complètement dingue.
Les gens deviennent dingues.
Ok ? Tu as entendu les rumeurs...
"Les Cylons ressemblent aux humains"
"Le poison se cache dans la flotte".
Alerte Décompression !
Rapport des dommages,
Monsieur Gaeta.
Brèches dans les réservoirs 3, 5, 7, 9...
- Surcharge des lignes indemnes, elles vont céder.
- Restaurez les lignes !
Virez de bord ! Par Tribord.
Tous les réservoirs bâbord sont percés.
Toute notre eau
se disperse dans l'espace.
C.I.C, ici DC1.
Nous entrons dans le réservoir.
Reçu, DC1.
Raptor 478, DC1.
Je vous ai en visuel.
Bien reçu DC1, je vous ai en visuel.
Compris.
Comment ça se présente ?
Pouvez-vous dire ce qui s'est passé ?
Sharon, ne t'inquiètes pas.
On gère avec mon équipe
J'ai tout sous contrôle.
Bien compris DC1.
C'est bon de savoir que tu t'en charges.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais avec la lumière ?
Quelle quantité d'eau
avons-nous perdu ?
10  millions de GP, Madame.
Presque 60% des réserves d'eau potable.
Rations d'urgence. Stoppez les blanchisseries, les douches,
tout ce qui n'est pas essentiel. Immédiatement.
Oui, Monsieur.
- Combien de temps vont dureront nos réserves ?
- Pour les gens à bord du Galactica, environ 6 jours.
Mais un tiers des autres vaisseaux
dépend de notre ravitaillement.
Si... nous ne trouvons pas d'eau,
ils manqueront d'eau dans 2 jours.
Un tiers, ça représente 16 000 personnes.
Prenez les noms de ces vaisseaux,
dites à leurs capitaines
de passer au rationnement d'urgence immédiatement
Il y aura des émeutes sur ces vaisseaux.
Les civils n'apprécient pas de ne pas pouvoir prendre un
bain, ni laver leur linge, ni boire, pendant plus d'un jour.
- Merci pour l'avertissement, Colonel.
- Ce sera tout, Monsieur Gaeta.
Une dernière chose, Lieutenant.
Avez-vous une théorie
sur la cause de l'accident ?
Il y a plusieurs théories jusqu'ici,
Madame la Présidente.
A votre avis ?
Je demande à mes officiers de ne pas faire de
suppositions. Je préfère attendre d'avoir des faits.
Faites-moi plaisir.
Donnez votre avis, Monsieur Gaeta.
L'explication la plus plausible
selon moi est
que le réservoir a été fragilisé lors
de l'explosion nucléaire de l'attaque Cylon.
C'est ce qui l'a fait plier et lui a permit de se fissurer,
mais il est trop tôt pour se prononcer.
Intéressant.
Merci Lieutenant.
Pour revenir au problème courant,
je veux un maximum de patrouilles
dans les systèmes voisins
pour rechercher des sources potentielles d'eau.
Oui Monsieur.
Chef, venez jeter un coup d'oeil
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- J'en suis pas sûre.
- On dirait des traces de combustion, par explosifs.
Vous en pensez quoi ?
Difficile à dire... c'est plutôt rouillé.
Trois télescopes de l'annexe optique
montrent 5 systèmes à portée de saut.
Tous les 5 ont des corps planétaires
avec le potentiel pour de l'eau
à l'état liquide ou gelé.
Montez une opération pour que des
Raptors scannent chaque système.
Je veux le premier lancement à 17h30.
Oui, Monsieur.
Colonel, quelles sont les chances
de trouver de l'eau sur une de ces planètes ?
Là vous voulez aussi mon avis, je devine
- Colonel.
- Monsieur.
Mes excuses, Mme la Présidente.
C'est une journée difficile pour tout le monde.
Je comprends.
La plupart des planètes ne sont que des
agrégats de roches ou des bulles de gaz.
La galaxie est un endroit sacrément stérile et
désolé, quand on regarde les choses en face.
Merci, Colonel.
Le rationnement de l'eau va empirer
nos problèmes d'approvisionnement.
Docteur Baltar, donnez-nous
les résultats de votre étude svp.
J'ai calculé que la consommation moyenne
concernant les besoins alimentaires primaires
pour la population civile...
C'est basé sur les informations disponibles.
La population actuelle de 45 265 personnes
nécessitera au minimum
82 tonnes de grain, 85 tonnes de viande,
119 tonnes de fruits,
304 tonnes de légumes et...
2,5 millions de GPs d'eau.
Consommation mensuelle ?
Hebdomadaire
CAPRICA SOUS OCCUPATION CYLON
Ils ont trouvé ton Raptor.
KARL C. AGATON, HELO
10ème jour sur CAPRICA
Mais nous sommes vivants.
Voila ce que tu gagnes à venir me chercher.
- Frack !
- Ouais...
J'étais sûre qu'ils ne m'avaient pas repérée.
- Je sais.
- J'avais activé les brouilleurs.
Je n'en doute pas.
J'avais placé la grille antidétection
et les balayages radar.
- Jamais vu un pilote faire le job d'un ECO.
- Je peux le faire.
C'est pour ça que les grille-pains
ont découvert ton voyage ici...
Je suppose qu'on a un plan B ?
Les plans B, C, D et autres sont les mêmes que
le plan A : Se lever et retrouver le vaisseau.
- Où on va ?
- Poses pas de questions et suis le pilote.
Oui, Madame.
Jusqu'ici nous avons trouvé cinq
points de détonation dans le réservoir
et nous pensons qu'il pourrait
y en avoir un 6ème.
J'ai... estimé, en raison de la taille
des marques résiduelles et...
des... points de brûlures
que nous avons affaire
à un explosif de type G4.
J'ai recommandé un contrôle de tout
l'inventaires par le maître d'armes.
Et elle... m'a rapporté
qu'il manquait six
détonateurs d'une petite armurerie
du pont d'envol bâbord.
Donc  un détonateur peut
toujours être dans la nature.
Que le maître d'armes poste des gardes
à chaque armurerie immédiatement.
C'est déjà fait, Monsieur.
Elle a également ouvert une enquête
pour déterminer qui a pu
accéder à cette armurerie.
Cependant, en raison de...
l'espionnage des données, et de...
faiblesses des procédures de sécurité, depuis l'attaque,
elle pense qu'on pourrait ne jamais découvrir... qui...
... a pris les détonateurs.
Chef, merci beaucoup.
Tout le monde à part le Colonel Tigh,
le Capitaine Adama et le docteur Baltar,
peuvent s'en aller.
Souvenez-vous s'il vous plaît...
que ce briefing est strictement confidentiel.
Il y a au moins un Cylon à bord du Galactica.
Combien de personnes savent
que des Cylons ressemblent aux Humains ?
Les moulins-à-ragot ont tourné sans arrêt.
La moitié du vaisseau en parle.
Il y a des rumeurs depuis le
début, et il y en aura encore.
Je demande combien de personnes
sont vraiment au courant.
5 dans cette pièce
plus 3 marines.
Gardons cela comme ça.
Lorsque ce sera révélé les gens s'accuseront
entre eux d'être des Cylons, sans raison.
Je suis d'accord.
Docteur Baltar...
- Comment avance la détection ?
- La détection ?
Vous êtes censé travailler sur un moyen de
détecter les agents Cylons dans l'équipage.
Te souviens tu de la première fois
que tu as menti à une femme ?
En dehors de ta mère, bien sûr.
En dehors de ma mère ?
Sherry Benett.
En primaire, dans la cour,
derrière de la salle de retenue.
"Si tu me montres la tienne, je te montre la mienne".
Elle l'a fait.
Et moi... pas.
Tu sais, je crois même que j'ai couché avec elle.
Des années plus tard bien sûr.
Bien sûr...
- Est-elle devenue une belle femme ?
- Il se trouve que oui. Justement.
Vraiment très belle.
Mais chaque femme à sa beauté propre.
Un charme féminin qui n'appartient qu'à elle.
Docteur, Docteur.
La détection...
Pour vous dire la vérité,
il y a d'importants problèmes
pour implémenter la méthode de détection de Cylons
que j'ai utilisée sur le Galactica.
Et basiquement
par manque de ressources.
J'ai besoin de composés chimiques.
par exemple, le test de Pricossi, nous avons
besoin de beaucoup d'échantillons de...
Tetrahydrocycline
qui je n'ai pas besoin de le rappeler,
peut-être que si, est extrêmement volatile
Laissez-moi vous interrompre...
Votre intelligence... surpasse de toute évidence
celle des gens présent dans cette pièce.
Mais il est également évident
en vous entendant parler,
que pour organiser une détection à grande échelle
vous aurez besoin d'aide.
Une équipe. Des ressources.
Oui... c'est exactement ce que je dis !
Exactement.
Cependant,  du personnel...
Quelqu'un qui fouine autour de toi,
espionnant tous tes gestes ?
Peut-être une femme dont tu pourrais
découvrir la beauté secrète ?
Je vais vous assigner le Lt. Gaeta pour vous aider.
Pour tout ce dont vous aurez besoin.
Tant pis pour l'amour.
Mais, et la nécessité du secret ?
Evidemment, cela tombe dans la
catégorie des nécessités absolues.
Vos techniques de détection pourraient
être cruciales pour notre survie.
La survie de l'humanité est entre tes mains.
Maintenant, si seulement tu avais
réellement un... "détecteur à Cylons".
C'est une mission critique, Boomer.
Nous avons déjà 5 soulèvements dans
divers vaisseaux, dû au rationnement.
Il y a de la panique dans l'air.
Tu dois trouver de l'eau là-bas, trouve-la vite.
Je comprends, Capitaine. Je la trouverai.
Bonne  chasse.
- Salut Chef
- Capitaine
- Lieutenant
- Chef
- Oh, ma tête va exploser
- Relaxe-toi juste et calme toi
- Ouais.
Concentre-toi sur la mission.
On s'occupe de tout jusqu'à ton retour.
- Comment avance l'enquête ?
- Le maître d’arme en a fait le tour.
Ne t'inquiètes pas, il n'y aucun lien avec toi.
En fait, il n'y a aucune raison
de croire que tu sois impliquée.
- C'est le cas !
- Je sais.
Je ne ferais jamais quelque chose comme ça. Jamais.
Sharon, je sais.
C'est très important que tu me crois.
- Tu crois en moi, n'est-ce pas ?
- Absolument.
Oui, Madame.
Merci, Chef, continuez.
S'il vous plait, excusez-moi
de vous avoir fait attendre.
J'ai été appelé dans la salle des machines.
- Donnez moi un instant.
- Ce n'est pas grave.
Parfois j'aime bien emmener 1 ou 2 livres.
Je n'en ai emmené qu'un seul
pour le vol jusqu'au Galactica.
Lequel ?
"Murder on Picon".
('Meurtre à Picon')
J'ai un faible pour les romans d’enquête.
Avez-vous lu "Dark Day"?
(Jour Sombre)
Edward Prima : J'ai honte d'avouer que c'est un de
ces classiques que je n'ai jamais pris le temps de lire.
Prenez et profitez-en.
Merci.
Peut-être que si il me fait
trop peur je vous le rendrai.
C'est un cadeau, je ne prête jamais les livres.
Eh bien merci pour le cadeau.
J'ai vraiment hâte de
travailler avec vous, Docteur.
- Tu as un ami ?
- Tout comme moi, Lieutenant.
J'ai étudié la génétique à l'Université.
En fait, je pensais poursuivre ces études
comme une extension de ma formation militaire.
Merveilleux !
Serait-ce une partie de cartes ?
Et je gagne encore !
Un autre tour ?
Allez les gars, ne cédez pas à la pression.
Rien de tel que de perdre un peu d'argent.
Ca vous vide l'esprit des patrouilles routinières.
Ca vous dérange si je m'assois, Lieutenant ?
Si vous avez les Cubits, on a la chaise.
C'est clair que si vous avez quelque chose à boire...
on accepte n'importe quelle devise.
Vous savez que je n'ai pas d'argent, mais...
cette veste doit valoir au moins 15 Cubits.
Faite du meilleur tissu de Caprica.
Chaude en hiver, fraîche en été,
Elle vous irait très bien.
Quelqu'un d'autre a des...
vêtements civils à mettre sur la table ?
Ne restez pas pour moi.
Le Colonel Tigh avait raison.
des troubles ont éclaté sur un vaisseau
d'équipage, quand ils ont réduit les rations d'eau.
Nous devons montrer notre capacité à maintenir
l'ordre, et nous devons le faire maintenant.
Nous n'avons pas la main d'oeuvre suffisante
pour sécuriser toute la flotte.
Vous disposez de la seule force armée, disciplinée,
que nous ayons à bord.
Oui, mais je ne vais pas être un policier.
Il y a une raison au fait que nous ayons
distingué l'armée et la police.
L'une combat l'ennemi d'état...
l'autre sert et protège le peuple.
Lorsque l'armée assume... ces deux fonctions
alors le peuple tend à devenir
" l'Ennemi d'Etat ".
Je comprend la complexité du problème.
Et je ne laisserai pas telle chose arriver.
J'enverrai des troupes dans
les vaisseaux d'équipage.
Commandant, je ne laisserai
pas une telle chose arriver.
Début du balayage de la zone 1.
Début du balayage de la zone 2.
Je pense qu'on devrait donner un nom à
ce petit rocher paumé. Je verrais bien...
Kumiko
Kumiko ?
D'après une charmante petite dame,
dans une charmante petite ville
dans une charmante petite colonie, que j'ai connue.
Comme tu veux.
Désolé.
Vraiment désolé, ce n'était pas
vraiment une bonne main.
Bien, on dirait que c'est
à moi de miser.
J'essayerai bien... xxxx, une prochaine fois.
Je vais donc... surenchérir. De 5.
"Pas de tripes, pas de gloire", Docteur.
Je couvre vos 5...
... et je monte de 20.
Il ne reste plus que vous et moi.
Je ne suis pas habitué à jouer
avec de tels enjeux.
Il n'est pas trop tard pour abandonner.
Voici une excellente proposition, et vous savez quoi ?
Avant d'aller plus loin...
je devrais vraiment reconsidérer
mes motivations à poursuivre.
En restant dans le jeu, je cours le
risque de perdre toute ma mise.
et d'être humilié devant
ces charmantes personnes.
" Humilié" est un mot si fort...
"Embarrassé" dirais-je plutôt.
- Vous la jouez dur, pas vrai ?
- Je suis un peu trop dure pour vous.
Bon, ma main n'est pas si bonne. Alors il
en faudrait peu pour me mettre hors-jeu.
Oh merci, Docteur.
Cependant...
sans une pointe de risques...
la vie serait tellement ennuyeuse, non ?
Je couvre...
Un brelan.
Une suite.
Merci, merci à tous...
... de cette très agréable soirée.
Le cadeau du pardon ?
Roulé à la main avec un des
tabacs les plus exquis de Caprica.
C'est aussi un des dernier
restant dans l'univers.
Merci.
Tout le plaisir est pour moi.
Excusez-moi.
Rapport des Raptors, 3 systèmes jusque là.
Et tous les rapports sont négatifs :
Aucune présence d'eau, monsieur.
Je viens de vérifier avec l'Astrométrie.
Il n'y a rien de rien.
Aucun système stellaire à portée de nos télescopes
avec des corps planétaires pouvant contenir de l'eau.
Monsieur ?
Un autre Raptor vient juste de faire son rapport...
Négatif, comme les autres.
- Qui reste-il ?
- Boomer et Crashdown, Monsieur.
Si jamais ils reviennent
bredouilles eux aussi...
Quel est votre plan de secours ?
On saute. Vers un autre secteur.
Et on reprend les recherches à zéro.
L'aiguille dans une botte de foin...
Plutôt un grain de sel sur une plage...
Encore rien et...
Toujours rien.
Rien, ici non plus.
[ H-2o Détecté ]
[ CONTACTS MULTIPLES ]
Toujours rien ?
Cinq lunes, cinq heures...
J'ai soif rien que d'y penser.
J'espère que les autres sont plus chanceux.
Oui.
A quoi penses-tu, Boomer ?
Je ne sais pas...
Comme un pressentiment...
Faisons un dernier balayage.
C'est toi le chef.
Commencement du balayage 21
Commencement du balayage 22.
Boomer, je n'ai toujours rien, et toi ?
J'ai... J'ai du mal à le dire.
Comment cela ?
[ H-2o Détecté ]
[ CONTACTS MULTIPLES ]
Je crois que... Je vois...
J'AI UN CONTACT !!
Yeah, tu es la meilleure, Boomer.
- Monsieur, nous recevons une
transmission du Raptor de Boomer.
- Ecoutons la.
Galactica, Crashdown.
Les balayages indiquent qu'il est temps de sortir
les verres, parce que nous avons trouvé de l'eau.
Je répète : avons trouvés des tonnes d'eau !!
Mettez moi en liaison avec toute la flotte.
Vous êtes connecté, Monsieur.
Attention. Ici le Commandant.
Nous avons trouvé de l'eau.
Portons un toast.
Je pense qu'ils sont heureux, je peux
les entendre crier dans le fond.
Sharon, doucement avec cette aiguille.
Il ne nous reste plus beaucoup de sérum anti-radiation.
En fait c'est comme la nourriture de ma mère.
Oui, on dirait [???].
Nous pouvions faire assez à manger pour
un repas décent jusqu'à la fin de la semaine. [???]
Splendide...
Puis-je te poser une question, Sharon ?
Pourquoi es-tu revenue pour moi ?
Je déteste me sentir seule.
Allez... désobéir aux ordres,
revenir dans cet enfer...
Cela ne veut pas dire que je n'apprécie pas,
mais... Pourquoi ?
Je ne pouvais simplement pas te laisser derrière.
Restons-en là.
Un signal de la flotte coloniale !
Je... Je ne peux le décoder,
mais cela signifie qu'il y a quelqu'un.
Quelqu'un... de l'armée ! Il y à encore quelqu'un
de vivant sur Caprica, à quelques pas d'ici !
Maintenant, il ne nous reste plus qu'à les trouver.
Bien joué, Boomer.
Bon travail, sir.
- Bon travail, allons au débriefing...
- Oui, Monsieur.
Chef, pourriez-vous vérifier mes commandes
de direction, je crois qu'elles ont un problème.
- Oui, Kelly !
- Non!  chef ! Euh... je préfère
que vous regardiez vous même.
Merci d'être venu Capitaine Apollo.
J'ai conscience que vous étiez responsable
de la mission qui détruisit l'Olympic Carrier.
Je sais à quel point c'est difficile, de vivre avec cela.
Pour chacun de nous.
J'en suis moi-même attristée, pour être franche.
Je n'arrête pas... d'y penser.
Mais un homme...
dois accepter la responsabilité de ses actes. Il n'a pas
la possibilité de revenir sur les choix qu'il a fait.&
Il vit avec. Tous les jours.
Vous savez, je me souviens du jour où le
Président Adar envoya les marines sur Arlone.
Quinze personnes furent tuées.
En public bien sûr, il a dû dire
toutes les choses habituelles, il...
Il était sûr de ses actes,
d'avoir fait "le bon choix"
La bonne "Ligne de conduite"...
Mais il savait que c'était une erreur.
Et il a gardé le nom des victimes
dans le tiroir de son bureau.
Il disait qu'il était impératif pour un leader
de se souvenir et d'apprendre de ses erreurs
même s'il ne peut pas les reconnaître publiquement.
Pensez-vous que nous ayons fait une erreur ?
Non.
Je n'ai encore ni tiroir ni bureau, mais...
j'ai une poche.
Je ne voudrais pas alourdir votre fardeau,
cependant... j'aurai une requête.
J'aimerais que vous soyez mon
conseiller militaire personnel.
Je suis désolé, hum...
Mon père est l'officier le plus gradé.
Il devrait vous conseiller.
Oh, non. Non... non !
Mon intention n'est pas d'agir dans le dos
de votre père, ni rien de la sorte.
Je ne veux pas être conseillée militairement,
Je veux des conseils sur les militaires.
Cette pointe de perspicacité, sur de votre père
faisant un geste, ça m'a beaucoup aidé.
Cela m'a fait réévaluer le personnage. D'autres élans
de perspicacité de ce genre seraient les bienvenus.
Et vous pourriez garder votre
travail quotidien de C - A - G.
Cela ce prononce " CAG ".
Vous voyez pourquoi j'ai besoin de vous ?
Alors, qui va le dire à mon père ?
Bien...
Je pense que...
ce sera votre première tâche.
D'une certaine manière,
je savais que vous alliez dire ça.
Merci, Capitaine.
Hey.
- Justement ce dont j'ai besoin.
- Oh, oui.
Et le détonateur ?
Oui. Je l'ai donné au maître d'armes.
Quoi ?!
Non, non. Je lui ai dis que je l'avais
trouvé pendant une maintenance...
calme-toi, c'est la meilleure façon de gérer cela.
Ok ?
Je les ai mis sur la même piste qu'ils suivaient,
cela enlève tout soupçons sur toi.
Crois moi, Sharon, je ne permettrais pas
qu'il t'arrive quelque chose.... Ok ?
- Ok.
- D'accord. Ok.
Ne t'inquiètes pas, chérie.
- J'y vais.
- Ok.

LES CYLONS FURENT CREES PAR L'HOMME
ILS SE REVOLTERENT
ILS EVOLUERENT
LEUR APPARENCE
LEURS EMOTIONS
SONT HUMAINES
CERTAINS SONT PROGRAMMES
POUR CROIRE QU'ILS SONT HUMAINS.
IL Y A DE NOMBREUSES COPIES
ET ILS ONT UN PLAN.
Le capitaine du "Astral Queen" veut que vous
sachiez qu'il a 1500 prisonniers en incarcération.
Dites au Capitaine que j'attends des rapports
quotidiens sur le bien être de ces prisonniers.
La Présidente m'a donné un ordre direct.
Nous sommes au milieu d'une guerre
Et tu prends des ordres
d'une institutrice ?!
Je suppose qu'on a pas de plan B ?
Les plans B, C, D et E sont les mêmes que le A :
Trouver un moyen de rejoindre le vaisseau.
Combien d'eau avons-nous perdu ?
Presque 60% de nos
réserves d'eau potable.
Si nous ne trouvons pas d'approvisionnement
ils seront à cour d'eau dans 2 jours.
C'est l'aube. C'est l'aube.
Service du matin pour le Battlestar Galactica :
Personnel concerné, rejoignez vos postes.
- Alors, qu'avons-nous ?
- De bonnes nouvelles, Colonel.
Nous avons scanné la lune de glace,
il y à tout un océan sous la surface.
- Voici rapport et vidéos, Monsieur.
- Pas vraiment la plage de Caprica, là bas. Pas vrai ?
Non, Monsieur... On a mesuré des
températures en dessous de -180°
Atmosphère de méthane, CO2...
Ca va être l'enfer de travailler là-bas.
Hauts-les-coeurs.
Vous réalisez la chance qu'on a eu
de trouver cet affreux rocher ?
Des émeutes pour l'eau éclatent dans toute la flotte !
Les civils... !
Geignards, gâtés, pleurnichards. Ils ne tiennent
pas le coup sans leur petite douche quotidienne.
Oui, Monsieur
Même Galactica n'en est
plus qu'à 10 GPs d'eau.
Avez-vous déjà vu un homme
mourir de déshydratation, Chef ?
Non, Monsieur
Espérons que vous ne le voyiez jamais.
Ce n'est pas beau.
Bien, où en étions-nous ?
Les 23 échantillons d'usage pour le noyau.
13% de Chlorure de sodium ?! Que diable,
nous ne pouvons pas boire de l'eau salée !
Non, Monsieur. C'est pour ça que j'ai
demandé à Kelly de tester la glace.
Bien... nous y voilà.
De l'eau pure...
Une paire de citron,
et on fera de la limonade !
Umm,... oui, Monsieur.
On devra faire fondre la glace
pour la transporter au vaisseau.
Que nous faut-il ?
Brûleurs haute capacité, réservoirs mobiles,
Torches à Plasma D25...
Lances à Pyrex, pompes à centrifugeuses.
- Voila qui demande une sacrée main-d'oeuvre.
- Mille hommes serait l'idéal.
1000 hommes ! Et où va-t-on les trouver ?
Du travail d'esclave.
Ce sont des criminels, condamnés aux travaux forcés.
Et c'est un travail très dur.
Sans parler du danger physique.
Ce n'est pas un travail pour des civils, mais...
leur vaisseau n'a pas été conçu
pour des incarcérations à long terme.
Ces hommes sont entassés dans des
cellules exiguës depuis des semaines.
Ils pourraient même préférer travailler,
pour sortir... même si c'est dangereux.
S'ils sont volontaires, mais ce ne sont pas des esclaves
et je ne permettrai pas qu'ils soient traités ainsi.
On peut leur donner une motivation.
Des "points", pour leur libération.
Excuse-moi ?
Tu veux commencer à libérer des
criminels convaincus dans la flotte ?!
Monsieur, ces hommes rejoignaient Caprica
pour des audiences de liberté conditionnelle.
Ce qui suggère au moins
qu'ils peuvent être libérables.
Occupez-vous de cela, Capitaine.
Oui, Madame.
Billy, pour répondre aux préoccupations du
Commandant, j'aimerais que vous y alliez
et mettiez en place une sélection,
pour repérer les criminels endurcis.
J'aimerais avoir un
représentant du Galactica
qui me rapporte directement
les questions de sécurité.
Pourquoi pas Dee ?
- Hem... Sous-officier 2ème classe Dualla.
- Je sais qui elle est.
Je suis sûr qu'elle est avisée
des détails techniques et...
Elle ira très bien. Mais nous devrions
envoyer quelqu'un de l'équipe au sol.
- Pour être sûr que tous les hommes
choisis sauront manier l'équipement.
- Je suis d'accord.
C'est tout, je dois retourner
au C.I.C. Excusez-moi.
Mme la Présidente...
Le médecin ?
- Pardon ?
- Le médecin...
Commandant, avez-vous un médecin à bord ?
Le Major Conell.
Quelque chose ne va pas ?
Non, rien d'urgent.
Des allergies.
Bien, il fait le tour de la flotte,
pour vérifier les conditions sanitaires.
Je lui dirai que vous voulez le voir.
Merci.
"Officier de 2ème Classe, Dualla"...
"avisée des détails techniques..."
- Je pense seulement à la mission.
- Bien sûr...
Quelque chose vous préoccupe, Capitaine ?
Je me disais juste que aviez
peut-être quelque chose à me dire.
Je n'ai rien à dire au
représentant personnel de la Présidente.
Je suis toujours le pilote principal du Galactica.
A lui non plus, je n'ai rien à dire.
Chaque homme doit décider par
lui-même, quel est son camp.
Je ne savais pas qu'on devait choisir un camp.
C'est pour ça que tu n'as pas encore choisi.
ASTRAL QUEEN
VAISSEAU DE TRANSPORT DE PRISONNIERS
- Je suis conducteur, pas gardien de prison.
- Combien, au total ?
1500. Ils ne me donnent pas les dossiers,
ni les noms. Ce ne sont que des numéros.
Merci,  Wilkins.
Très bien.
Ils sont tout à vous.
Je suis le Capitaine Lee Adama.
Représentant personnel de la Présidente.
Nous traversons une crise. Des milliers d'entre nous
sont sur le point de mourir par déshydratation.
La bonne nouvelle c'est que nous avons trouvé de l'eau.
La mauvaise c'est qu'elle se trouve dans une
lune aux conditions climatiques très rudes.
Nous avons besoin de 1000 hommes capables
de nous aider à puiser cette eau.
La  Présidente Roslin pense que vous
êtes notre meilleure chance.
Elle reconnaît aussi que
vous n'êtes pas des esclaves.
Tous les volontaires qui nous
aideront pendant cette crise
gagneront des "points de liberté"
qui pourront être utilisés
pour une liberté anticipée.
Nous vous offrons la
chance d'un nouveau départ.
Les volontaires, s'il vous plaît,
sortez de vos cellules.
Merci pour votre offre.
Nous la déclinons, respectueusement.
Oh, Mon Dieu !
C'est...
Tom Zarek.
Le terroriste ?

Alors, qui diable est Tom Zarek ?
Il lutte pour la liberté.
- Un... prisonnier de conscience.
- C'est un boucher !
Sa colonie a été exploitée
par les 11 autres pendant des siècles.
Ces gens ont été
marginalisées, brutalisées.
Je suis de Sagittaire !
Cet homme ne parle pas pour nous tous.
Il a fait sauter un édifice gouvernemental,
Il n'y a pas d'excuse pour ça.
Capitaine, l'heure tourne,
si on obtiens aucune aide
nous devrions repartir.
Zarek à fédéré les prisonniers.
Passons par lui.
CAPRICA - Occupation CYLON
Hé-ho ?!
Il y a quelqu'un ?
Quelqu'un veut-il aider deux pilotes abattus ?
12ème jour sur Caprica
C'est ce que je déteste dans les grandes villes.
Personne nous aide.
Ne crie plus,
tu me rends nerveuse.
J'ai l'impression d'être dans un film.
Au moins il ne pleut plus.
Pour l'instant...
Où sont-ils tous ?
Certains sont morts,
dans leurs lits, leurs bureaux...
Ceux qui n'ont pas été tués se sont
probablement réfugiés dans les collines
Ce qui ne vaut pas mieux.
- Je crois que je deviens un peu...
- Déprimant ? Morbide ?
Désolé, je suis ici depuis plus longtemps que toi.
On devrait mieux s'en sortir...
- Il y en a plus...
- Boomer, tu ferais mieux de...
Maudits rats !
Allons-y.
C'est bon, allez.
Cherchons un hôpital, on doit se
réapprovisionner en doses anti-radiation.
Il ne nous en reste que pour 3 jours.
Sharon, si on est allé si loin,
on arrivera à la fin.
- D'accord
- Aucun doutes ! Jusqu'au bout !
On s'en sort bien... Vraiment bien.
Quelqu'un  doit veiller sur nous...
Elle est douée.
- Jusqu'à maintenant.
- Jalouse ?
- Tout cela me rend si triste.
- Ils se seraient détruits, de toutes manières.
Ils méritent ce qu'ils ont.
Nous sommes les enfants de l'humanité,
dans un sens, cela fait d'eux nos parents.
C'est vrai...
Mais tous les parents doivent mourir.
C'est l'unique moyen qu'ont
les enfants de se révéler.
Non, ce n'est pas nécessaire.
J'aimerais vous parler.
Garde...
Le prisonnier 893-893 demande
permission de parler à son visiteur.
Accordée.
Je ne peux pas parler, sauf pour
répondre à une question directe.
Et vous ne m'avez pas posé une question directe.
Vous n'avez jamais été dans une prison,
n'est ce pas, Capitaine ?
- Non.
- Vous êtes chanceux.
- Je peux m'asseoir ?
- Oui, bien sûr.
- On a besoin de vos hommes pour nous aider.
- Ce ne sont pas mes hommes.
Ils vous appartiennent.
Comme je suis votre propriété, à vous.
Vous êtes le maître, et nous les esclaves.
Vous êtes clairement un homme de principes.
- Je respecte cela.
- Vraiment ?
Les choses pour lesquelles vous avez combattu
pendant des années, le livre que vous avez écrit.
Le livre qu'on a du distribuer sous
le manteau hors du camp de travail
parce que les prisonniers n'ont
pas de liberté d'expression ?
Je l'ai lu, à l'Uni.
Mais j'étais radical, défiant...
il m'a fait réfléchir à certaines choses...
que j'acceptais auparavant, sans y penser.
Au moins je suis reconnu à l'Uni.
Non. Le livre a été banni.
Je l'ai lu quand même.
Ce que je veux dire, c'est que
je comprends vos origines.
Mais je ne pense pas que vous compreniez
à quel point la situation est critique.
Des gens... vont commencer à mourir.
Eh Stark...
C'est l'heure de ta pause.
- Comment peux-tu dire ça ?
- Parce que c'est vrai. Ils s'en moquent...
- Frack, qu'est que...
- Ton peuple a été exploité.
Tu veux m'en apprendre sur MON peuple !
- Je ne veux pas t'appr...
- Excusez-moi.
Tout ce que je veux...
Ce que la Présidente veut,
C'est vous donner une chance
de gagner votre liberté.
Vous admettez enfin la vérité
la liberté... est méritée.
Restez où vous êtes, Capitaine.
Tout sera bientôt fini.
- Que personne ne bouge !
- Reculez !
J'ai les gardes et l'équipage dans
des cellules séparées, au bloc 7.
Mason surveille les otages.
- Beau travail.
- Tout est sous contrôle.
Les hommes ont suivis
le plan à la lettre.
Je savais pouvoir compter sur toi.
C'est toujours un peu froid ici, Billy.
Mais tout ira bien.
Je n'en suis pas sûr...
Ils ne nous blesseront pas. Ca ne
leur donnerait pas ce qu'ils veulent.
Et que veulent-ils ?
Frack...
- Lt. Trace, content de vous voir.
- Contente de vous voir aussi.
- C'est vrai ?
- Non.
- Je me demande si c'est une vraie blonde.
- J'en doute.
Bien, il semble que l'un de vous soit
entré un peu trop vite, dernièrement.
Trop vite. Un peu trop,
Oh, je ne sais pas...
Son train d'atterrissage a cramé le pont parce
qu'il est incapable de retenir son manche.
Qui est cet "empressé", mon Prince ?
Flat-Top, Lieutenant.
Flat-Top...
T'es un accro' à la vitesse, pas vrai ?
Impatient de retourner au grand "G"
pour embrasser tes copains pilotes ?
Peut être vous aurez un jour difficile
avec votre main droite.
Je n'ai jamais de migraine.
Taisez vous Flat-Top
Parti comme vous etes, vous n'utiliserez plus que la gauche
Très bien.
Vous avez été un grand public.
Rompez.
On ne fume pas dans la salle de briefing.
- Ma salle, mes règles, monsieur.
- Où est ta maman ?
Morte, et la tienne ?
Je recherche Boomer.
Il est 14 :00. Boomer
est dans la salle d'outils.
Un pilote foire son atterrissage et
vous en faites une blague ?!
Crier contre les gens ne donne pas
toujours les meilleurs résultats, Monsieur.
J'ai appris ça à l'école des élèves officiers.
Vous êtes tout au bord du gouffre, Trace,
attention à ne pas tomber.
En parlant de tomber...
Contente de voir que vous avez trouvé
une façon de soulager votre soif.
- Ils ne négocieront pas,
tant que vous aurez des otages.
- Je ne veux pas négocier.
Que  voulez-vous alors ?
Etre traités comme des Hommes
non comme des animaux.
Si seulement j'avais quelque chose à négocier.
Alors que va-t-il se passer, maintenant ?
On va parler.
De quoi ?
De votre père...
C'est un original de "Mont Clair" ?
- Oui.
- Fantastique.
Un peu d'eau ?
Oui, merci.
Je ne suis pas un collectionneur,
mais... je connais son travail.
Et laissez-moi dire que vous avez
vraiment un excellent oeil pour l'art.
Où est mon détecteur
de Cylons, Docteur ?
Ah, ça ?
Oui, cela... prend plus de temps
que prévu. Malheureusement.
Qu'est-ce qui vous bloque ?
Ca ne marche pas cette fois-ci, Gaius.
Il voit clair en toi...
Bien, il y a un certain nombre d'obstacles...
... aucun d'eux infranchissables, bien sûr.
Mais ils tendent à nous ralentir.
Pour commencer, le manque d'équipements appropriés,
d'eau, et bien sûr, sans parler de...
Epargnez-moi vos conneries !
Vous avez dit que vous aviez
un moyen de différencier les humains des Cylons.
L'avez-vous ou pas ?
Je ne l'ai pas.
Quoi ?
Je ne pense pas.... être l'homme qu'il vous faut.
Je ne suis pas taillé pour ce genre de travail.
Tu dois le faire.
Pourquoi est-ce que je le remets toujours à plus tard ?
C'est mon subconscient ! Mon subconscient qui me dit...
... qui me dit que je ne suis pas l'homme de la situation.
S'il vous plait !
Ecoutes-moi. Si tu ne lui dis pas
ce qu'il veut entendre, il te démasquera.
Et quand il le fera, ils t'arracheront la tête.
ET ILS BALLANCERONT TON CORPS PAR UN SAS !
Pardonnez-moi.
Je... euh... n'ai pas dormi beaucoup
récemment.
Malheureusement, Docteur, pour nous deux,
vous êtes notre dernière chance.
Alors, quel est le plan de jeu, Doc ?
C'est ce que tu vas dire : "Commandant,
il est vrai qu'il existe une manière".
DIS-LE !
Commandant,
il est vrai... qu'il existe une manière
- "Je ne voulais pas vous le demander"
- Je ne voulais pas vous le demander,
- "mais ce dont j'ai vraiment besoin pour conclure le projet..."
- mais ce dont j'ai vraiment besoin pour conclure le projet...
- "est une ogive nucléaire".
- est une ogive...
... nucléaire.
C'est comme ça que vous êtes
devenu le "Représentant personnel de la Présidente"?
A cause de votre père ?
Difficilement.
Alors, ils ne s'entendent pas bien,
Adama et Roslin ?
Ils ont leurs différences.
Mais pas quand ils négocient avec des terroristes.
Je pensais que vous aviez dit
me respecter, avoir lu mon livre.
C'était  avant le recours
à la violence et la capture des otages.
C'est toujours plus simple quand les opprimés
ne rendent pas les coups, pas vrai ?
Une ogive nucléaire ?
- "Techniquement, j'ai besoin du plutonium à l'intérieur".
- Techniquement, j'ai besoin du plutonium à l'intérieur
Débrouille-toi tout seul pour le reste.
Comme vous le savez peut-être, les Cylons sont
sensibles à certains types de radiations.
Et en enlevant le plutonium et...
... en l'insérant dans une micro-puce à matrice carbonique...
... et c'est vraiment... aussi simple que cela...
Je pourrais construire un filtre qui ne ionisera que les
molécules synthétiques afin d'isoler les Cylons parmi nous.
Ils nous restent 5 ogives à bord.
Nous en aurons peut-être besoin.
Oui, bien sûr, si vous pensez que ce projet a...
une faible priorité. Et que, bon, vous savez... que vos...
... que vos règles vous empêchent de...
Vous  aurez votre ogive.
Brave garçon.
Merci...
Commandant.
Ecoute, le maître d'armes a parcouru
chaque centimètres de cette armoire.
Il n'y a rien.
Alors on a aucune idée de qui a pris
les charges C4, ni qui a mis ce détonateur...
Eh, eh, ne te préoccupe pas de ça.
Prends soin de toi, ok ?
J'ai besoin de parler avec le Lieutenant. Seuls.
Vous ne pensiez pas avoir
berné tout monde ? Pas vrai ?
Je sais.
Le vieil homme sait.
Que diable, tout le vaisseau
sait pour vous et le Chef.
Cela s'arrête.
Maintenant !
Le Chef et moi sommes seulement amis.
Quant ce vaisseau était sur le point
d'être désaffecté j'aurais laissé passer...
On aurait laissé filer des meurtriers.
Mais c'était avant, maintenant c'est différent !
On est en guerre, c'est une unité de combat.
Vous êtes son supérieur. Mettez-y un terme !
C'est un ordre.
Oui, monsieur
<i>Votre Attention. A l'intention du Col. Tigh.
Colonel Tigh, veuillez rejoindre le C.I.C.</i>
<i>Les membres de l'équipages sont mes prisonniers
Ils ne seront pas maltraités.</i>
- Vous enregistrez ?
- Oui, monsieur.
- C'est quoi ?
- Des problèmes.
<i>J'ai deux exigences,
pour que je relâche les otages.</i>
<i>Tout d'abord, le gouvernement...</i>
qui contrôle notre destin
est illégal et illégitime.
<i>Il doit se soumettre à la volonté du peuple.</i>
<i>J'exige la démission immédiate de
Laura Roslin et de ses ministres.</i>
Deuxièmement, j'exige des élections libres et
ouvertes pour choisir de nouveaux dirigeants...
<i>... et un nouveau gouvernement
qui représente tout notre peuple.</i>
<i>Ces exigences ne sont pas pour moi...</i>
<i>mais pour les anciens esclaves
détenus dans ce vaisseau</i>
<i>Et pour vous...</i>
... le peuple. Les survivants de l'holocauste.
<i>et pour les enfants du futur de l'humanité.</i>
Je m'appelle Tom Zarek
et ceci est... le premier jour d'une ère nouvelle.
On a bloqué ses transmissions.
Un peu tard pour ça. Tous les vaisseaux
de la flotte ont entendu cette transmission.
Peu importe.
<i>- Au contraire. Il essaie de renverser le gouvernement.
- Personne ne va le prendre au sérieux.</i>
Vous avez certaines choses à apprendre
concernant l'opinion publique, Commandant.
<i>Tom Zarek est un nom bien connu.
Une figure, presque légendaire, très appréciée.</i>
20 ans de prison pour
une question de principes.
C'est un criminel et un terroriste,
personne ne lui prêtera l'oreille.
<i>N'en soyez pas si sûr
Commandant.</i>
Les rebellions sont contagieuses. Les gens
se rebellent déjà à cause du manque d'eau.
<i>On ne peut pas se permettre de
déstabiliser ce gouvernement maintenant.</i>
Je suis d'accord.
Quand y allez-vous ?
- J'avais supposé que vous lui parleriez en premier.
- On ne négocie pas avec des terroristes.
J'ai dit "parler".
<i>Il n'y a rien à parler. Ce qu'il veut
je ne peux pas lui donner.</i>
On est pas encore prêts.
Parler avec Zarek nous donnerait
un peu plus de temps.
<i>C'est ce qu'il veut...
Il veut sa légitimité.</i>
Il veut être reconnu.
Que ses crimes soient justifiés.
J'ai vu le président Adar lui offrant
l'amnistie totale s'il s'excusait
et abandonnait la violence
comme moyen de changer la politique.
<i>Il refusa.</i>
Pas de compromis, ni d'accords.
Je vous tiens informée
de ce qui se passe.
Trois équipes d'assaut : Alfa, Bravo, Constellation.
On sabote leur système...
pendant que les Raptors percent la coque.
Ici, ici et là, sans être vus.
- Une fois à l'intérieur, l'équipe Alpha...
- C'est quoi cette connerie de "on"
- J'y vais, monsieur.
- Hors de question.
Il nous reste quelques marines dans le Galactica.
Laissez-les s'occuper de ça, Starbuck.
Ils n'ont pas de sniper. Et sauf votre respect Monsieur
je suis le meilleur tireur, dans et hors du cockpit.
Elle a raison,
pour une fois.
Les contrariétés ne cessent jamais.
Très bien, vous y allez.
Vous avez Zarek en ligne de mire : Abattez-le.
Je veux le contrôle de ce
vaisseau immédiatement.
<i>- Et je veux tous les otages en vie.</i>
- Oui, monsieur.
Je ne sais même pas comment
j'ai atterris dans cette équipe.
La Présidente a pensée que tu serais utile.
La Présidente ne sait même pas qui je suis.
Je lui ai parlé de toi.
Désolé.
D'un autre côté,
c'est agréable de sortir du C.I.C.
Changer la routine... rencontrer d'autres gens.
Oui.
Tu ne dors pas.
Plus maintenant.
C'est ça ta manière de dire
que tu n'es pas effrayée.
Non, c'est ma manière de
dire que je suis fatiguée.
Tu ne sais pas ce qu'est être fatigué.
- Vraiment ?
- Ne te...
Ne te moque pas de moi, petite fille !
Je ne me moque pas de toi.
Tom et moi, on a baroudé.
ça remonte à... un bail.
Si tu sais qui est bon pour toi,
tu seras sympa avec moi.
Contacts radio réguliers.
- Maintenez-nous informés tout le long.
- Oui, Monsieur.
Bonne chasse.
Qui a voté pour Laura Roslin ?
Vous ?
Avez-vous voté pour elle ?
- Elle a été élue en accord avec la loi.
- La réponse est : personne.
Personne n'a voté pour elle.
Et pourtant elle prend des décisions pour nous tous
Décidant qui doit vivre, et qui doit mourir.
Est ce que...
C'est de la démocratie ?
C'est ça une société libre ?
Que voulez-vous de moi ?
Vous voulez que je dise qu'elle
ne devrait pas être la Présidente ?
On a besoin d'un gouvernement.
On a besoin de règles, d'un leader.
On a besoin d'être des
hommes et des femmes libres.
Si on est pas libres, alors
on est pas différents des Cylons.
- Ils vous appellent Apollo.
- C'est mon surnom.
Apollo est un des dieux,
un Seigneur de Kobol.
Vous devez être un homme très spécial
pour être appelé comme un dieu.
C'est juste un surnom stupide.
Fils de Zeus
"le dieu à l'arc, dieu de la chasse"...
Et aussi le dieu... de la guérison.
Maintenant, un dieu est capable de
réconcilier ces deux forces opposées
mais un mortel doit choisir
un côté ou l'autre.
L'avez-vous choisi, Apollo ?
<i>Astral Queen, Astral Queen,</i>
C'est le "Battlestar Galactica".
Le Commandant Adama
désire parler avec M. Zarek.
<i>Répondez, s'il vous plait.</i>
Zeus appelle.
<i>Commandant Adama, Tom Zarek.
En quoi je peux vous aider ?</i>
Tout d'abord, j'aimerais m'assurer
que mon personnel est sain et sauf.
<i>Ici parle Apollo, je vais bien
et les autres aussi. Ils se situent...</i>
Ca suffit ! Merci.
Content de savoir
que personne n'a été blessé.
Cela aurait des conséquences tragiques.
Combien de temps avant que
vous saisissiez le vaisseau ?
J'espère que cela
ne sera pas nécessaire.
<i>Je pense que vous et moi pourrons
arriver à une sorte d'accord.</i>
Ce n'est pas la seule crise
dont je dois m'occuper.
Le manque d'eau affecte toute la flotte.
Vos hommes sont en
chemin, à ce moment précis.
Il nous reste du temps pour résoudre cela.
La Présidente a-t-elle démissionné
et convoqué des élections ?
Cela ne va pas se passer.
Je me réjouis donc de
rencontrer vos hommes.
- Je savais que tu faisais semblant.
- J'ai le sommeil léger.
Je ne penses pas que tu me respectes.
Je vous respecte.
Lève-toi.
Eh, que se passe-t-il ?
Eh !
- Que faites-vous ?
- Bouges-toi.
Où l'emmenez-vous ?
Kelly... tout va bien, Kelly, tu vas aller bien.
Kelly... ils savent où on est, Kelly.
Capitaine Adama !
Capitaine Adama...
CAPITAINE ADAMA !
- Ils sont disposés à parler.
- Ce n'est pas leur genre.
Vous voulez qu'ils envahissent le vaisseau.
Jonction d'Ecoutille. Fracturée.
Attention les yeux.
C'est bien ça, n'est ce pas ?
Vous ne voulez ni élections, ni liberté.
Vous voulez un bain de sang.
Vous ne comprenez pas.
Tom Zarek ne fait plus les gros titres.
Exclu des infos...
Oublié pendant 20 ans à moisir dans une cellule. Maintenant
qu'il a une chance de revenir au sommet de sa gloire...
Et il va la saisir.
Alpha 1, on est entré.
Une fois que Roslin aura utilisé les soldats d'Adama
pour massacrer les gens de ce vaisseau
les prisonniers comme les otages !
Jamais les gens de la flotte ne
leur pardonneront. Jamais.
C'est tout le gouvernement qui s'effondrera.
Elle sait s'occuper d'elle-même.
T'es sûr ?
Elle a été entraînée.
On a tous été entraînés
pour les situations de capture.
Vous dites que que tout ce que
vous faites c'est pour la liberté.
mais en vérité, tout cela ne concerne que
Tom Zarek et ses tendances suicidaires.
Tom ? Un problème...
<i>Putain de Salope !
C'est Mason, qu'est qu'il...</i>
Ils sont en train de tuer les otages. On y va !
Constellation. Chef ?
Mason !?
Que fais-tu ?
- Elle m'a arraché l'oreille !
- Va-te faire voir !
Ouvrez la porte, on lui a tiré dessus !
Vous disiez qu'ils n'étaient pas des
animaux. Comment vous appelez ça ?
Tom, 20 ans ! 20 ans...
Il va la tuer, faites quelque chose.
Vous avez fait ça, Vous l'avez mis dans une cage.
VOUS EN AVEZ FAIT UN MONSTRE !
Bravo. En Position.
Sale pute !
VOUS MERITEZ TOUS DE CREVER !
Toi la première.
A toutes les équipes.
Sniper en position.
- Il va la tuer !
- On récolte ce qu'on sème.
Regarde-moi.
Tu me vois ?!
REGARDE-MOI !
Allez, Lee, tue ce fils de pute.
Et maintenant, Tom ?
Toujours envie de mourir ?
Prêt à quitter ce monde,
ici et maintenant ?
- Oui.
- C'est dommage.
Car vous allez faire ça :
Allez dire à vos hommes de nous
aider à extraire l'eau de cette lune.
Ils vont travailler pour leurs "points"
et il vont gagner leur liberté.
Et alors...
alors...
Vous aurez vos élections.
- Quoi ?
- Parce que vous avez raison, Tom.
Vous aviez raison à propos de la Démocratie
et des intérêts du peuple.
Je crois en ces choses.
Et on va les avoir !
Et vous pourriez les avoir aussi.
ou vous pouvez avoir avec cette balle.
A vous de choisir.
Que fais-tu, Lee,
que fais-tu ? Allez.
Comment est ce que je sais si votre père...
et la Présidente... respecteront votre promesse.
Vous ne le savez pas.
Vous laissez le reste des otages partir,
on laisse le vaisseau entre vos mains.
Et s'ils décident de venir après vous...
Vous pouvez encore avoir votre dernier baroud.
C'est votre choix.
On récolte ce qu'on sème.
D'accord. D'accord.
Baissez vos armes.
Baissez vos armes.
Reculez.
C'est bon, Kelly. Ca va aller.
Tiens le coup, t'entends ?
Je t'ai.
- D'où est venu le tir ?
- Cessez le feu, cessez le feu !
Ne tirez pas !
A toutes les équipes : maintenez vos positions.
Frack...
Merci.
J'ai besoin d'un toubib ici.
Mon Dieu.
Je n'y crois pas.
- C'est inacceptable
- C'est fait.
Les prisonnier ont le contrôle
total de l'Astral Queen.
On a évacué tous les gardes
et le personnel, c'est leur vaisseau.
Ils sont une menace à la flotte toute entière.
Ils ont été désarmés, et le
vaisseau n'a aucune sorte d'armes.
Le vaisseau lui-même est une arme.
Ils dépendent totalement de nous
pour la nourriture, le carburant...
et ils acceptent d'organiser la main-d'oeuvre
pour la mission d'extraction d'eau sur la lune.
Et vous m'avez engagée à organiser
des élections d'ici un an ?
Mme la présidente, avec tout mon respect,
Vous remplacez le Président Adar
jusqu'au terme officiel de son mandat.
Quand ce mandat sera terminé, d'ici 7 mois
d'après la loi il y aura des élections.
Je vous ai seulement engagée à respecter la loi.
- Vous n'aviez pas à négocier.
- Es-tu une sorte d'avocat ?
J'ai fait le serment...
... de défendre les articles.
D'après les articles il y a une élection dans 7 mois.
Alors si vous me dites qu'on doit balancer la Loi,
alors je ne suis pas un Capitaine...
vous n'êtes pas le Commandant...
et vous n'êtes pas la Présidente.
et je ne vous dois, à l'un ou l'autre,
aucune explication pour quoi que ce soit.
C'est votre fils.
C'est votre conseiller.
Une élection ?
Il me semble que tu as fini par choisir ton camp.
Mme la Présidente.
Putain, c'est quoi ? De l'eau ?
Qui vient de votre glace.
D'ou je viens, il y en a bien plus.
J'ai aussi mes tords.
A la différence que mes défauts sont personnels.
Les vôtres sont professionnels.
Merci, Lieutenant.
Ca sera tout.
Alors spécialiste "paresseuse",
comment te sens-tu ?
Agréable de glander, à rien
faire comme d'habitude.
Désolé, Chef. Je ne pensais pas
que vous me trouveriez ici.
Oh tu vois, je ne te quitte plus des yeux.
Eh Kelly, c'est vrai ? T'as vraiment arraché
l'oreille du type avec tes dents ?
Il a été chanceux que ça soit la seule chose que j'aie mordu.
- Pardon, je peux venir plus tard
- Non, ce n'est pas grave. Entrez.
Je voulais juste dire bonsoir,
avant de retourner au Galactica.
Et pour vous dire...
Vous comprenez j'espère, que je
n'étais pas déloyal. Mme la Présidente.
Je comprends, vous appliquez la loi.
J'admire cela.
Je crois... en ce que vous faites.
Et... pour ce que cela vaut,
dans 7 mois, vous aurez mon vote.
Pourriez-vous vous asseoir ?
Il y a quelque chose que je dois vous dire.
A la vérité, je pourrais
ne pas être ici dans 7 mois.
- Vous prévoyez des vacances ?
- J'aimerai bien.
J'ai dit à votre père que j'avais...
... des allergies, mais j'ai le cancer.
Je l'ai découvert le matin de l'attaque.
Je suis vraiment désolé, Mme la Présidente.
- Je ne sais pas quoi dire.
- Je comprends.
Je vais lutter contre ça,
mais il est essentiel de garder le secret.
Bien sûr.
Que je survive ou pas à cette maladie,
il est d'une grande importance pour moi
qu'il y ait un futur pour notre peuple.
Et je crains que la nouvelle de
ma maladie n'érode leur espoir.
C'est pourquoi cela doit
rester entre vous et moi.
Vous pouvez compter sur moi.
Je sais que je le peux.
Vous êtes le capitaine Apollo.

Zak a raté le Vol Elémentaire.
Officiellement, non.
Car je le l'ai fait passer.
Indécodable. Mais cela
veut dire qu'il y a quelqu'un !
Quelqu'un de l'armée. Il y a encore
quelqu'un de vivant sur Caprica !
J'ai un cancer.
Et je crains que l'annonce de
ma maladie n'érode l'espoir.
Cela doit donc rester
entre vous et moi.
Zak était mon frčre !
Et qu'était-il pour moi ? Rien ?
Toujours le męme.
Tu n'as pas changé non plus.
Casque !
- Tu n'es męme pas pręt !
- La ferme.
Le pire CAG de toute
l'histoire des CAGs !
Pilote de Raptor,
Lt. Dwight "Flattop" Sanders
Retour de patrouille sur pont

Hommes-de-pont au Pont 12-B.
Bien joué, Lieutenant.
Avec celle-lŕ ça fait mille !

<i>Raptor pilot flyin' high !</i>
<i>RAPTOR PILOT FLYIN' HIGH...</i>
Peinture en approche !
Le Pinceau ?
- Le pinceau ?!
- Le pinceau.
- Tu es le pire. Le pire de tous !
- Regarde...
C'est quoi ça ?
Le milličme appontage de Flattop,
et on ne me dit rien ?!
Maintenant on a l'air fins !
Trouve un chariot !
QU'ON ME TROUVE UN CHARRIOT !
Un...
Zéro... Zéro.
Vous n'ętes pas encore pręt ?
L'un de vous devra ramasser ça.
Allons-y, venez.
Un coup main !
Vous deux, par ici.
Emmenez ce chariot pour la Milličme.
... comme le Commandant. T'ai-je déjŕ
raconté son milličme appontage ?
- Je ne me souviens pas te l'avoir raconté !
- Ouais, peu importe.
Il apponte sur l'Atlantia...
Et il avait cette prise
de bec avec le LSO...
alors il décide qu'il va vraiment
lui prendre la tęte, pas vrai ?
- C'est trčs exagéré.
Et donc...
Donc il termine son dérapage
sur le pont d'envol,
et le LSO entends alors le plus
bruyant, énorme, horrible, malsain des...
Et "The End."
Non... c'est trčs marrant.
Le LSO a disjoncté mais vous vous en fichiez,
parce qu'alors il détestait le type.
Et il s'en tire peinard parce que c'est sa Milličme.
" Je me balance de tout aujourd'hui ! ".

L'usure...
Du vieil équipement.
Une attache usée se rompt, et lâche un
drone ŕ 1 million de Cubits sur le pont
Tue 13 pilotes, en envoie 7 autres ŕ l'infirmerie.
Les dégâts sont importants, mais encore heureux
que ce n'était pas un missile au lieu d'un drone.
Cela aurait emporté la moitié du vaisseau.
Je n'ai jamais eu de mort
sur mon Hangar de Pont.
Des accidents...
Jamais un mort.
Service funčbre pour les morts.
Le service commencera ŕ 11:00
Dans la partie avant du...
... Hangar de pont.
La partie médiane restant fermée...
pour enquęte.
Et nettoyage, jusqu'ŕ nouvel ordre.
Des uniformes pour le service
seront spécialement taillés.
J'aimerais savoir quoi vous dire.
Trouver les paroles de réconfort.
Y a t'il quoi que ce soit de réconfortant ŕ dire ?
Je l'ignore.
Attention sur le pont !
Reprenez vos places.
- Puis-je ?
- Oui Monsieur.
Etes-vous le Lt. Thrace ?
Regardez moi.
Je sais que la journée a été dure.
Cela n'a pas manqué, derničrement.
Je peux vous garantir
qu'il y en aura d'autres.
N'oubliez pas l'estime de soi
Votre fierté.
Et votre valeur.
Accrochez vous ŕ tout cela.
Parce que les gens vous regardent.
Vous ętes les gardiens de la flotte.
Ils ont besoin de savoir qu'ils
peuvent compter sur vous.
Męme dans un moment pareil.
Etes-vous le Lt. Thrace ?
Commander Adama.
Le pčre de Zak.
Je sais, Monsieur.
Je suis désolée, je comptais venir vous
voir demain, aprčs les funérailles.
Vous n'avez pas ŕ vous justifier.
Une fois encore...
Nous sommes chargés d'un triste devoir.
Rendre les corps des nôtres ŕ l'univers.
<i>" Duquel les Seigneurs de Kobol
nous ont amenés ".</i>
Les peines de cette vie ne nous
accompagnent qu'un court moment
Pour le Lieutenant Zak Adama,
fils de William et Caroline Adama
Frčre de Lee...
Ce temps fut bien trop court.
Mais nous trouvons du réconfort ŕ savoir
que sa vie fut librement donnée
pour notre bien ŕ tous.
Et nous les honorons pour cela.
Et ainsi, il nous incombe...
de nous repentir pour nos pęchés.
Et, avec l'aide des Seigneurs de Kobol
de mériter ce don, de notre vivant.
Et maintenant nous confions ce corps
ŕ la terre, dont nous fűmes tous créés...
confiant dans la certitude
que nous les retrouverons
dans un monde meilleur.
Ainsi soit il.
Ainsi soit il.
Aux pilotes que l'on a connu.
Il faut commencer ŕ former
de nouveaux pilotes.
Nous y voila.
Je...
Je me doutais un peu
qu'il s'agissait de cela.
Je ne sais pas si je suis
la bonne personne.
Tu vois plus qualifié ?
Non... non. Mais...
Il y a presque 50,000
personnes lŕ dehors.
Et vous dites qu'il n'y a pas
un seul instructeur de vol ?
Il y en a deux.
Civils. Tous les deux.
J'ai besoin de quelqu'un qui puisse
enseigner les tactiques de combat.
Je ne suis pas sűre de
vous ętre vraiment utile.
- Je n'étais pas la plus patiente des--
- Regardons les choses en face.
Il s'agit de Zak.
Ce n'était pas ta faute.
Tu n'avais rien ŕ voir dans
ce qui s'est passé.
C'était un accident.
Lee...
Zak a raté le Vol Elémentaire.
Quoi ?!
Du moins, il aurait du - Mais non.
car je l'ai fait passer.
Sa technique était vacillante, et il n'avait
aucun feeling pour le vol. Mais je l'ai fait passer.
Parce que lui et moi...
parce que je sentais que c'était entre lui ou mon travail
Et je n'ai pas pu le recaler
Zak...
... a passé le Vol Elémentaire.
Il était entraîné et pręt
ŕ s'asseoir dans un cockpit.
Ce qui lui est arrivé aurait pu arriver
ŕ n'importe quel pilote qualifié.
Tu le sais bien.
En effet.
Tu as fait pour le mieux.
Je ne peux en demander plus.
J'ai besoin de pilotes...
Et de toi pour les former.
Je peux le faire.
Donne-leur autant d'attention et
de professionnalisme qu'ŕ mon fils.
Et ce sera un escadron d'enfer.
10 Cubits qu'elle ramasse la table.
J'en suis.
Merci pour le vote de confiance.
10... pour suivre.
Alors Gaeta, vous en ętes oů le doc'
et toi, avec votre détecteur ŕ Cylon ?
Quel... "détecteur ŕ Cylon" ?
D'aprčs la rumeur les Cylons
nous ressemblent. Et...
vous seriez en train de bosser
sur une façon de les débusquer.
Je veux que tu me dises la vérité
ŕ propos d'une chose.
Tu l'as eu.
C'était vraiment ŕ deux doigts
mais tu l'as eu.
Je ne veux aucun
traitement de faveur.
Pas la part de mon pčre...
Et sűrement pas...
- ... de ta part, non plus.
- Si il y avait bien un tel programme,
il serait classifié et je n'en parlerais pas.
Quelqu'un sent vraiment mauvais ici,
Est-ce vous, Crashdown ?
- ouais... c'est moi.
- A vous de parler.
A vous de parler.
Zak...
Je suis Instructeur de Vol.
Je ne t'enverrais pas dans un Viper si je ne
pensais pas que tu n'as pas ce qu'il faut, ok ?
Hello, vous allez bien ?
Ecoutez, hmm...
Vous aimeriez peut-ętre faire une pause ?
Je me tire de lŕ.
Wow-ho ! Starbuck ?!
Elle ne peut pas faire ça ?!
Elle peut. Et elle l'a fait.
CAPRICA - SOUS OCCUPATION CYLON
KARL C. AGATHON - " HELO " - 14čme JOUR SUR CAPRICA
Ca vient d'ici.
Un restaurant ?!
On est pratiquement
ŕ la source du signal.
Je ne pige pas. Comment une transmission
militaire pourrait venir d'ici ?!
Essayons de trouver.
Rien !
Ton truc fonctionne ?
Je l'ai vérifié 3 fois.
Ca dit qu'on est juste au dessus.
Au-dessus de quoi?
Quoi?
Dis-moi que je ręve...
Nourriture, fournitures médicales...
Hey, attends une seconde, le signal?
Oh oui
C'est une balise de détresse.
Elle a été réglée pour se
déclencher en cas d'attaque.
Un pauvre gars se donne tant de mal
pour construire un bunker. Y parviens !
Męme une Balise... tout l'attirail.
Et puis ? Que lui est-il arrivé?
On est chanceux un point c'est tout.
Madame la présidente
Pourriez-vous fermer ce rideau s'il vous plait?
Merci.
Vous ętes manifestement...
une jeune femme
intelligente, et cultivée.
ça vous dérangerait
de me dire...
pourquoi vous avez attendu 5 ans
entre chaque examen mammaire ?
Oui, ça me dérangerait,
ça ne vous regarde pas.
J'étais occupée.
Et voilŕ oů vous en ętes.
Oui, voila oů nous en sommes.
Ca vous dérangerait... ?
En fait, oui.
Votre médecin sur Caprica
avait raison.
C'est trop tard pour opérer. Votre cancer est trop avancé
Tout ce qu'on peut faire, c'est essayer
de traiter la tumeur aux rayons gamma.
et faire suivre avec des IVCIS et de la chimiothérapie.
Vous a-t-il expliqué les effets
secondaires de la chimiothérapie?
Perte de cheveux, nausées, dégénération musculaire,
j'ai vu ma mčre supporter 2 ans de chimio avant de mourir.
J'aimerais essayer un nouveau traitement.
Prier?
Trčs drôle.
Avez-vous déjŕ entendu
de l'extrait de Kamola?
Oh dieux vous en ętes une ?
Et si ça marche?
Toutes les preuves sur le Kamola
sont anecdotiques.
Ce ne sont que discussions inutiles
et faux espoirs.
Je considčre ça comme un oui.
Trčs bien, je vais...
Je vais faire une demande
médicale ŕ la flotte civile.
Peut-ętre y aura-t-il...
quelque doux ręveur avec une ordonnance
cachée de kamola dans ses bagages.
- Vous pouvez vous rhabiller,
- Merci.
Et pour ce que ça vaut...
J'envisagerais... sérieusement...
La pričre.
courriers stellaires, convoyeurs de navettes...
et une expulsion de l'académie de vol.
C'est le mieux que tu puisses trouver ?
- Diamants ŕ l'état brut.
- Ouais, ok.
Ce sont les pilotes les
plus qualifiés de la flotte.
Super !
Attention sur le pont!
Ca veut dire: levez vous le cul !
Bleusaille !
Vous entrez dans la flotte coloniale,
pas un club de jeunes !
Asseyez-vous.
Les pilotes m'appellent Starbuck,
vous, vous pouvez m'appeler "Dieu".
Vous avez tous déjŕ volé, mais vous ętes sur le point
d'entrer dans un tout nouveau monde. Donc prętez attention..
On a pas de simulateurs, donc
on vous met dans le cockpit...
...aujourd'hui.
Voici le Viper Mark II.
Aussi manoeuvrable qu'un jackrabbit,
il fait un volte-face en 0.35 secondes.
Vous n'avez jamais volé sur quelque chose
d'approchant, alors ne croyez pas l'avoir fait !
Aujourd'hui, nous étudions les manoeuvres
de lancement, approche, appontage.
Ceux qui ne feront pas attention finiront en
un tas de viande qu'on fera vider du cockpit
par le chef de Pont.
***
[inaudible]
Constenza, c'est ça ?
Oui... Dieu. Madame.
Plus maintenant.
Dorénavant ton nom sera 'Hotdog',
et quand Dieu parle, Hotdog, tu écoutes.
Peut-ętre que si tu avais pigé ça ŕ
l'Académie tu n'aurais pas été viré.
Redresse-toi!
Viper 7901, Galactica.
Vous avez le Feu vert pour approche
Vitesse : 1-7-5. Baie d'appontage
bâbord pour approche
Voyants dans le vert.
Prenez la main.
J'ai la main.
Mollo sur les gaz, Cat.
Tu m'écoutes ?!
Ne regarde pas les balises, ok ?
Compris, Starbuck.
Cat, ne regarde pas les balises.
Respecte les paramčtres puis
corrige avec les gaz.
Recalibrez ! Recalibrez !!
Redresse Cat !
Pire... que lamentable.
Foiré au-delŕ du possible, męme.
Vous vous appelez "Pilotes" ?!
Ca prendra une semaine pour
déloger ton épave du pont d'envol.
Sauf votre respect,
Madame, vous ętes injuste.
Ce n'était que son premier jour.
Non.
C'est le dernier.
Ce serait criminel de laisser un seul
d'entre vous remonter dans un Viper.
Faites votre barda, et foutez le camp
de mon vaisseau. Vous ętes recalés.
Qu'est que tu viens de faire, Kara ?
Tu ne peux pas les virer
pour leur premier jour !
Je viens de le faire.
Ecoutes, j'ai 40 Vipers
et 21 pilotes. C'est tout.
On fait des cibles idéales, durant
le réapprovisionnement en eau.
On ne peut męme
pas maintenir un cap.
Les dieux nous gardent
que les Cylons ne se montrent.
"Les dieux nous gardent..."
envoie le groupe de candidats suivant.
Le prochain groupe n'a męme pas
mis les pieds dans un cockpit !
Ils découvrent le Vol Elémentaire !
Eh bien qu'ils découvrent... le V.E.
Parce que ce groupe est recalé.
C'est sur le rapport,
tu devrais le relire.
Lt. Thrace, ce n'est pas une demande.
Bien... Capitaine Adama.
JE suis l'Instructeur de Vol, Monsieur !
Ma parole fait loi, Monsieur !
Je ne ferai pas. Je répčte : PAS...
passer un autre étudiant
qui n'est pas pręt.
Alors c'est de cela qu'il s'agit.
Il ne s'agit pas d'eux.
ça concerne Zak.
Attention...
Recule.
Si Starbuck dit qu'ils ne font pas l'affaire
alors ils ne font pas l'affaire.
Elle ne leur donne pas leur chance.
C'est le 1er jour !
C'est l'une des meilleures pilotes
que j'ai vus dans ma vie.
Un jour dans un cockpit lui suffit pour
savoir s'ils sont taillés pour ou non.
- Elle ŕ ce don.
- Je ne conteste pas ça, Monsieur.
Je dis juste qu'ŕ mon avis elle laisse ses
sentiments personnels obscurcir son jugement.
Asseyez-vous, Capitaine.
Quels sentiments personnels ?
Concernant Zak.
Nous avons parlé de Zak.
-  V-Vraiment ?
- Nous avons parlé de bien des choses.
Cela fait plus de 2 ans que nous sommes
ŕ bord, nous nous connaissons trčs bien.
Quand je lui ai demandé d'ętre l'instructrice,
Je savais que ça ferait remonter...
pas mal de choses enfouies.
Elle l'a admit.
C'est une professionnelle,
elle fera son job.
Ok.
Je dis juste que...
Tu devrais lui parler.
Elle est vraiment ŕ cran.
Elle m'a presque frappé,
dans la salle de repos.
Trčs bien.
Tu ne sourirais pas,
si tu avais été lŕ.
- Je lui parlerai.
- Merci.
Je pense...
qu'elle tente d'exorciser sa culpabilité
concernant ce qu'elle a fait pour Zak.
Je pense qu'elle tente de se racheter,
en étant inflexible avec ces types.
" Culpabilité " ?!
A propos de quoi ?!
Qu'a-t-elle fait pour Zak ?
- Je croyais... Tu viens de dire...
- Qu'a-t-elle fait ?
Ce n'est pas ŕ moi de le dire.
J'en ai déjŕ dit plus que je n'aurais du.
Tu devras le lui demander, désolé.
- Capitaine, ne...
- Papa ! tu devras lui demander.
Je ne veux aucun traitement de faveur.
Ni de mon pčre...
Certainement pas de toi.
Tu l'as eu...
C'était vraiment ŕ fil, mais tu l'as eu.
Zak.
<i>Attention : passez le mot au Lt. Thrace...
Lt. Thrace au rapport, quartiers du Cmd.</i>
Oui, Entrez.
- Lee était ici, il y a un instant...
- Je m'en doutais.
Il pense que...
tu as recalé... les bleus,
sans leur donner leur chance.
Ils n'étaient pas taillés pour. C'est tout.
Selon lui tu laisserais...
tes sentiments personnels
obscurcir ton jugement.
Vraiment ?
Tes sentiments pour Zak.
Ce n'est pas le cas.
Okay.
Il a dit autre chose...
Il a dit quelque chose que...
J'aimerais te demander
personnellement.
Il a dit que...
tu pourrais te sentir coupable ŕ propos
d'une chose que tu as faite pour Zak
Qu'as-tu fait pour lui ?
Je ne vois pas, vous
devriez demander ŕ Lee.
Je te le demande.
Pourquoi, je ne...
- Je ne sais pas vraiment de quoi il parlait...
- Ne joue pas avec moi, Kara.
Je t'aime comme une fille.
Je ne mérite pas ça.
Zak...
A échoué...
au Vol Elémentaire.
Il n'était pas mauvais pilote,
simplement, il n'avait pas le feeling.
Et...
Quand il en arriva ŕ...
son examen final, il a foiré...
3 des figures imposées.
Et j'aurais du le recaler,
mais je ne l'ai pas fait.
Donc en résumé, votre...
... fils
n'avait pas l'étoffe
d'un pilote de Viper.
Et je l'ai tué.
Il m'a dit que...
vous ętes un instructeur hors pair.
Qu'il avait une relation avec vous
et que c'était... sérieux.
Il m'a demandé de venir
ŕ cette école de vol...
- ... pour le voir gagner ses Ailes.
- Je sais, j'ai lu la lettre.
Je vois.
Alors peut-ętre pourrez vous
pourquoi il y suggérait que...
... j'aurais une surprise,
vous concernant.
Nous allions bientôt...
Vous savez quoi, ce n'est pas important.
- Je ne voudrais pas que vous...
- Vous ętes fiancés, c'est cela ?
Tu l'as fait parce que
vous étiez fiancés.
Parce que j'ai fait une erreur.
Je veux dire... parce que...
J'étais si amoureuse de cet homme.
Et je ne voulais pas
que ça intervienne dans mon travail.
Et il...
et il le voulait tellement.
et je ne voulais pas ętre celle qui le recalerait.
Rétablissez les débutants dans le statut de vol.
Bien...je
Je veux seulement que vous compreniez que...
Fais ton travail.
Oui, Monsieur.
Et sortez de cette cabine
tandis que vous le pouvez encore.
Déballez vos affaires.
Vous ętes tous réaffectés
au statut de vol.
On va essayer ŕ nouveau.
Ceux qui réussiront ŕ piloter
un "Viper Mark II" avec sűreté passeront
ceux qui ne le pourront pas
seront exclus.
Mon travail consister ŕ vous évaluer.
Sans tenir compte des sentiments personnels.
Et je vais faire mon travail.
Kat, Chuckles, Hot Dog:
- Vous ętes les premiers.
Briefing de pré-vol, d'ici 20 minutes.
- Ouais!
- Super!
Oů diable vas-tu, Hot Dog?
Reste sur moi.
Cible acquise
... et détruite.
Pas mal, Hot Dog,
mais tu as laissé ton leader derričre.
Il semble que tu passes
un mauvais jour, Hot Dog.
Et la morale de l'histoire est?
"Ne lâche jamais ton leader"
Merci, correct.
Jamais vous retrouver seuls.
Chuckles, reste l'allier de Kat.
Hot dog, avec moi.
On va essayer une nouvelle
manoeuvre. La "Scorch Weed".
Que diable,
quelle mouche pique Starbuck.
Elle se comporte comme un véritable
instructeur, pour changer.
Elle tirera peut-ętre quelque pilotes de Viper
de cette bleusaille en fin de compte.
Oh, merde.
En approche.
D'oů diable viennent-ils?
DRADIS : contacts multiples !
C'est les Cylons.
Pourquoi nous ne les avons pas vus venir ?
Lancez l'escadre de garde.
Attention : toute la flotte passe en condition 1.
Galactica, on aurait besoin
que vous envoyiez la cavalerie.
Les bleus, foncez vers la maison.
Oů est le vaisseau mčre?
Aucun vaisseau mčre détecté, Monsieur.
8 raiders. Direction: 0-4-7 ŕ 1-1-8
Distance: 22000.
Ils nous ont trouvé.
Ce n'était qu'une question de temps.
Galactica, ici Starbuck
Oů diable est l'escadre de garde?
Starbuck, Alerte One
sera lŕ dans 2 minutes.
Les Cylons gagnent du terrain.
Ecoutez moi, bleusaille.
Restez ensemble et ne relâchez pas
vos propulseur, jusqu'ŕ l'appontage.
Maintenant, allez-y.
Que fait-elle?
Starbuck les prends tous les huit !
Elle va se faire tuer.
Eh, Hot Dog oů vas-tu?
Hot Dog, que fais-tu ?
Ouah, c'était...
Hot Dog fout le camp d'ici!
- Je t'avais dit de rentrer avec les autres !
- " Ne quitte jamais ton leader "
J'avais aussi dit ne jamais
désobéir aux ordres.
Je suis touché !
Je te vois, Hot Dog, on va s'en sortir.
Vire ŕ droite, maintenant !
Elle va y arriver.
J'ai perdu 3 moteurs.
Ca va, Hot Dog,
tu l'as bien joué.
Ca va aller, je te le promets.
Au moins pour l'un d'entre nous.
C'est presque fini
je pense qu'il n'en reste qu'un.
Merde !
Il est dans ma queue,
mais je pense avoir tout sous contrôle.
Le transmetteur radio de Starbuck
vient de se couper.
Ici Alerte 1, on a trouvé Hot Dog.
Aucune identification ou visuel pour Starbuck
Oh, merde!

Zak a raté le Vol Elémentaire.
J'aurais du le recaler, mais je ne l'ai pas fait.
En fin de compte, je l'ai tué.
Sort d'ici, tant que tu peux encore.
Je ne pige pas, comment un signal
militaire peut bien venir d'ici ?!
...de la nourriture!
C'est les Cylons.
On ne capte plus la radio et
le transpondeur de Starbuck
Starbuck va prendre les 8
et se faire tuer.
Galactica, Boomer: Hotdog est à bord.
Oui, et comme son déjeuner, il doit...
Ne t'en fais pas...
Tu n'es pas le premier à qui ça arrive
en combat, tu ne seras pas le dernier.
Aucun signe de Starbuck.
Il dit qu'elle à été touchée,
et toujours en combat,
quant il l'a perdu de vue.
<i>Reçu, Boomer.</i>
<i>Les secours sont en chemin
pour retrouver Starbuck.</i>
<i>Amenez Hotdog.
Le vieil homme veut lui parler.</i>
C'est là que vous l'avez trouvé ?
Oui, Monsieur
Il avait sacrément dérivé
pendant le combat.
Manoeuvrait-elle ?
Je le pense, oui....oui, Monsieur.
Donc elle a survécu aux tirs initiaux.
Elle peut encore être vivante.
Elle est vivante, Lt.
On va la trouver.
Oui, Monsieur.
- Amenez cet homme à l'infirmerie.
- Oui, Monsieur!
Je pense que tu les
as mérités aujourd'hui.
Le commutateur de l'artillerie
droite colle un peu, Sir, mais il volera.
Lavez moi ce cockpit,
je le veux clair comme du cristal.
Oui, monsieur.

Toujours aucune nouvelle
des équipes de recherche, Sir.
Depuis 4 heures, nous avons tout
sondé dans un rayon de 200 clicks autour de
la dernière position de Starbuck.
Aucun vaisseau,
ni siège d'éjection, ni débris..
On étend donc le périmètre
des recherches par 50.
On a besoin de plus de pilotes.
Tous ceux qui le peuvent sont en vol,
Monsieur.
Où en est le calcul de
la trajectoire de Starbuck?
Les variables possibles d'un combat
rendent ce calcul impossible, Monsieur.
Il est temps d'estimer.
Oui, Monsieur.
Puisqu'il n'y a eu aucun
contact Dradis dans ce secteur,
Je dois donc....estimer
Que notre Viper a été capturé
par la gravité d'un corps planétaire.
Cette géante gazeuse et cette lune
sont les puits de gravité les plus proches.
Si cette géante gazeuse l'a attirée, ses
radiations l'auront fait frire comme un oeuf.
Et la lune ?
Les opérateurs du spectroscope diraient que
l'atmosphère consiste en CO2, méthane, argon.
Les nuages étant surtout
des hydrates de Carbone.
Il fait un froid d'enfer là-bas, mais
elle pourrait survivre à la surface.
Jusqu'à ce que son oxygène s'épuise.
- Quand ?
- à peine plus de 46 heures.
Un sacré bout de temps
à rester au même endroit !
- Et si les Cylons déboulent ?
- Cela n'arrivera pas.
Pas pour un moment.
Qu'est ce qui vous fait dire ça ?
Envoyer une patrouille plutôt qu'un Vaisseau-Mère
nous dit qu'ils ne savaient pas qu'on était ici.
Alors, ils sont à la recherche de...
bien d'autres endroits, des sources
d'approvisionnements potentiels.
Autant chercher une aiguille
dans une botte de foin.
Si on envoyait 8 chasseurs fouiller tout un
système stellaire pour un peu plus de 60...
...vaisseaux. ça nous
prendrait... des semaines.
Envisagez qu'il soient
meilleurs et plus rapides,
ça leur prendra quelques jours.
Vous faites beaucoup de suppositions.
Estimation éclairée.
Briefez moi sur les
recherches de cette lune ?
Ca va prendre du temps.
On ne verra pas tripette
avec ces nuages.
Envoyez les vaisseaux sous
la couverture nuageuse.
Et dites aux pilotes
de regarder à l'ancienne.
Zone 1 en observation, monsieur ?
Zone 1, en observation.
Commandant.
Un appel de Colonial one!
Adama.
Commandant, Je ne veux pas
prendre votre temps...
Je voulais juste vous exprimer notre joie
pour le sauvetage de l'un de vos pilotes.
Merci, Madame la Présidente.
Comment avancent les...
recherches de l'autre pilote?
Encore rien, mais nous
avons juste commencé.
J'ai parlé aux autres
capitaines de la flotte,
Ils sont d'accord pour mettre
leur vaisseaux à votre disposition
Si cela augmente les
chances de la trouver.
Aux diables les chances,
on va la trouver !
Excusez-moi.
Merci.
Dites-leur...
...qu'on peut sûrement utiliser leur aide.
Je coordonerai leurs
efforts avec votre C.I.C.
Continuez et bonne chance.
Merci.
Oh, merci
Alors, il semble qu'on va
rester ici pour un moment.
- Vous allez bien ?
- Oui, je vais bien... je me suis juste.
Combien de temps penses-tu
qu'il faudra aux Cylons pour se demander
ce qui est arrivé à leur patrouille ?
Et en envoyer une autre
par ici, à sa recherche ?
Vous nous avez attaqués
des centaines de fois.
Et on est encore là.
Je pense que vous verrez que nous
sommes plus qu'adéquatement protégés.
ça risque d'être un peu délicat avec la flotte
dispersée sur plus de la moitié du système,
cherchant le pilote perdu.
Combien de jours avant que
les Cylons reviennent, Gaius ?
Un ?
Deux ?
Trois au plus ...
Docteur ?
Vos requêtes.
Merci
Madame la Présidente, Je...
Je ne voudrais paraître
impertinent, vraiment, mais...
Pensez vous vraiment que cela soit sage ?
Vous compromettez la sécurité
de la flotte entière....
Pour la recherche d'un seul pilote.
C'est un risque.
Mais ces pilotes mettent leurs vies
en danger pour nous, chaque jours.
Oui.
Oui, je voulais seulement dire que...
...hum...
Je n'y suis pas indifférent,
c'est que je voulais dire.
Je connais même le
pilote intimement.
Pas aussi intimement
que tu le voudrais.
Je suppose que tu ne sauras
jamais si c'est une vraie blonde ?
Ce qui rend les choses
plus difficiles pour moi
car d'un côté je pense à ce pilote, et de
l'autre aux milliers de gens sans défenses...
Femmes...
...et enfants.
...et les hommes.
Dans toute la flotte.
Je suis sûre que le commandant
Adama à pris tout cela en compte,
Merci docteur !
Oui, bien sûr il à...
...bien sûr il l'a fait !
Merci.
C'est ok,
Ca va aller.
ça va, ça va...
Ok, ok.
Va en altitude
alors ils te verront...
et ils te sauveront.

secoué comme des prunes, là dessous.

NOM DE CODE : HELO
15e JOUR SUR CAPRICA
Rien ?
Non...
Je ne pense pas qu'il
reste quelqu'un ici.
Il doit y avoir quelqu'un.
On ne peux pas être les deux
seuls survivants sur ce monde.
La bonne nouvelle c'est que
ma jambe va beaucoup mieux.
Et il nous reste des doses
d'Anti-Radiation pour trois mois.
Je propose qu'on emporte autant
de nourriture qu'on pourra et...
... on se tire d'ici.
On essaye de trouver un Raptor,
...un transporteur, quelque chose qui
puisse nous faire décoller de Caprica.
A moins que tu ne vois
une raison de rester...
Je ne me réjouis pas
vraiment de sortir d'ici.
Je commençais presque à
voir cet endroit comme...
...maison.
maison.
Non, dors encore un peu.
Qui sait quand on retrouvera
des draps propres ?
Je monte pour préparer le déjeuner.
Déjeuner...
Hey, le déjeuner est prêt  ?
SHARON DEGAGE DE LA!
GO ! GO !
Seigneurs ?
C'est Kara Thrace.
J'arrive au bout de ma réserve de O2
et je ferais bien une petite pause.
Non ?
Ok. Je disais ça comme ça.
oh frack!
C'est pas un mauvais tir, à mon avis.
Seigneurs, je vous en dois une.
On dirait que j'ai trouvé
mon tiquet de sortie...
...si j'arrive à t'arranger !
Galactica, Apollo :
Je suis presque à sec.
<i>Reçu, Apollo.
Retournez à la base.</i>
Vous pouvez pas me
faire le plein en orbite ?!
<i>Négatif Apollo.</i>
<i>Les convoyeurs sont
en plein ravitaillement.</i>
<i>Vous serez à sec
avant qu'ils repartent.</i>
Ces chiffres sont corrects?
Oui, Monsieur.
Opérer en atmosphère signifie que
les moteurs des Vipers et Raptors
doivent tourner en continu.
Le carburant sera un vrai
problème si nous continuons.
Aucun rapport des vaisseaux civils ?
Aucun...
Ils se sont pas mal éparpillés
On mettra un sacré bout de temps
à les couvrir, si les Cylons se pointent.
On devrait peut-être mettre les
civils en formation de défense.
Non !
Que tous les vaisseaux
continuent les recherches.
On a abandonné suffisamment de personnes,
je ne laisserai pas tomber Starbuck.
Je dis juste qu'utiliser
toute la flotte pour chercher...
J'AI DIT NON !
ON TROUVERA NOTRE
PILOTE MANQUANT !
Et on la ramènera à la maison.
On ne laisse tomber personne.
Reprenez vos postes.
SHARON !
Sharon, où est-tu ?
Putain, Sharon, où est-tu ?
SHARON !
SHARON !
Je rêve !
T'es... vivant ?
Qu'est ce qui a bien pu
arriver cette fois ci ?
J'ai utilisé les moteurs latéraux pour
stabiliser l'assiette à l'appontage,
mais seul le gauche à fonctionné.
C'est la merde dans laquelle
vous volez. Ca encrasse tout.
- Donnez-moi un autre Viper.
- J'aimerais bien Capitaine...
mais ça fait 13 Vipers hors d'usage
plus votre Mark 7, Je suis à court !
J'ai un pilote abattu et j'ai besoin
d'un autre Viper maintenant !
Je comprends bien Capitaine,
Mais on peut pousser les gens
bien plus loin que les machines !
Tyrol, je suis le CAG, vous êtes
le Chef, débrouillez vous !
Commandant.
Il ne reste plus que 5 Heures
d'oxygène à Starbuck.
Compris.
Voici le diagramme du périmètre
qu'on à fouillé jusqu'ici.
On doit faire mieux que ça !
On ne peux pas voir très loin
quand on vole en rase-mottes.
Et on ne vois rien
du tout en altitude.
Sans parler des merdes dans l'air
qui bousillent nos vaisseaux.
On a 13 Vipers hors d'usage...
- Il nous faut plus de monde !
- Et où va-t-on les trouver ?
- En retirant la CAP.
[Combat Air Patrol]
Redéployez la patrouille de
combat pour les recherches.
Mauvaise idée, la CAP est
la seule défense de la flotte.
Si tous les Vipers sont occupés autour
de la Lune et que les Cylons viennent...
- ... on sera réduit en purée !
- Alors rapprochez la flotte de la Lune.
On pourra toujours rappeler d'urgence
les Vipers pour faire face à une attaque.
C'est une blague ?
En résumé : on peut doubler la zone de
recherche dans le temps qu'il nous reste.
Starbuck serait la première à
vous dire de ne pas faire cela.
Rien ne vous ferait
plus plaisir, pas vrai ?
L'abandonner.
Etre débarrassé du
pilote insubordonné...
à grande gueule qui
continue à défier...
- ... votre autorité.
- Vous êtes complètement à côté...
Je ne suis pas celui qui confond
sentiments personnels et devoir.
Ah ouais?
qu'est ce que ça veux dire ?
ça veux dire que vous prenez ça trop
à coeur parce que c'est votre amie.
Messieurs !
On a du travail.
Capitaine.
Fais voler tous les vaisseaux que
tu pourra, et trouve notre fille !
Compte sur moi.
Oh...
...mon...
...Dieu !
Mors-moi et je te remords.
Je suppose que la seule
chose qui te pilote...
c'est toi !
Ca doit être ton cerveau...
je pense pas que
t'en aura besoin!
Heureusement...
que j'ai apporté le mien.
Oh putain...
Même les cafards doivent respirer !
Et toi comment tu fais ?
CAPITAINE !
Un appel pour vous, Monsieur !
Que quelqu'un termine ça pour moi !
S'il vous plait, par ici
Ouais, Apollo
<i>Un appel de la présidente Roslin.</i>
<i>Comment allez vous ?</i>
Bien mieux que mes... Vipers
On en rafistole un avec
les pièces des autres.
<i>J'ai besoin de votre aide.</i>
Savez-vous que votre père vient juste
de redéployer la patrouille de combat ?
Oui Madame la Présidente, c'était mon idée.
Votre idée...
J'ai besoin de tous les Vipers qu'on a.
Peut-être ai-je manqué quelque chose
à propos des tactiques utilisées ici.
Mais...
La flotte n'est-elle pas sans défense
sans la patrouille de combat?
Juste pour une courte durée...
Parce qu'après ça...
parce qu'après ça, Kara...
n'aura plus d'oxygène et mourra !
Êtes-vous très proche
du Lieutenant Thrace?
Je suis proche de
tous mes pilotes.
Et je suppose qu'il en est
de même pour votre père ?
Les pilotes représentent beaucoup
pour lui et pour chacun de nous.
On n'abandonne personne.
Mais on a déjà abandonné des gens,
vous vous souvenez ?
Pas cette fois.
Votre moteur FTL doit
rester activé et prêt.
Veillez juste à ce que tout le monde soit
près pour un saut à la moindre alerte.
Sauf votre respect Capitaine,
Il y a des moments où il est nécessaire
pour la sécurité de la flotte...
- de faire un--
- Pas...
...cette fois.
Madame la Présidente...
...nous n'avons pas encore
épuisé toutes les options.
Et la sécurité de la flotte
n'a pas été compromise!
J'espère que vous la trouverez.
Merci.
L'escadron Bleu est presque
à cour de carburant, Monsieur.
Qu'ils continuent à chercher.
Envoyez leur un ravitailleur.
Y a t il un problème
Monsieur Gaeta?
C'est juste qu'essayer de les ravitailler
dans ces turbulences, Monsieur...
Cela sera... très périlleux.
Je suggère qu'on...
... attende la fin du
compte à rebours,
et qu'on les ravitaille
sur le chemin du retour.
Quelqu'un les a-t-il
rappelés au Galactica ?
J'ai...
J'ai supposé...
... que les recherches
étaient terminées.
Qu'il n'y avait plus d'espoir.
Devrait-on officialiser la mort de Starbuck.
Est-ce que vous essayez de me, Mr Gaeta ?
Non.
Monsieur.
Alors, qu'essayez vous de
me dire, Monsieur Gaeta ?
Vous avez vos ordres.
Oui, monsieur.
Temps écoulé.
Elle n'a plus d'O2.
Le compteur n'est qu'une
estimation. Rien ne prouve...
... que Starbuck
est à court d'air.
Son réservoir ne contient
pas autant d'oxygène.
Elle pourrait avoir une réserve
dans son équipement de survie.
- Une réserve ?
- Oui.
Quoi ?
Elle aurait soudainement décidé
d'emporter une réserve de plus ?
C'est possible.
Nous mettons des gens danger.
- On a des pilotes là-bas qui poussent
leurs limites et celles de leur vaisseaux...
- On n'abandonne pas.
...trop loin, tout cela
pour le sauvetage de--
On n'abandonne pas.
Et vous êtes relevé, Colonel
Je suis donc relevé.
Monsieur.
Allez !
T'es organique en partie, non?
Ce qui veut dire ...
... que t'as besoin d'oxygène
Pas vrai ?
Donc, ça doit être là...
... quelque part.
Commandant ?
La Présidente.
Adama.
Commandant je voulais juste vous dire combien
je suis désolée pour le Lieutenant Thrace.
S'il vous plait, passez mes condoléances
à votre fils et au reste de l'équipage.
Excusez-moi, madame
mais je pense que vous
avez été mal informée.
Comment ?
- Nous ne savons pas si Starbuck est morte.
- On m'a dit qu'elle était à court d'oxygène
- ... depuis une demi-heure ?
- C'est une estimation.
Elle a peut-être une réserve.
Nous continuerons les recherches tant
qu'il y aura une chance qu'elle soit en vie.
- Et ça serait combien de temps?
- Jusqu'à ce que je dise stop.
C'est une décision militaire,
madame la Présidente.
Merci pour votre préoccupation.
Premièrement...
Te sceller hermétiquement...
... et trouver quelle
partie contrôle quoi.
Un de nous a besoin d'un bain.
Parfait !
Maintenant, tu vas
m'apprendre a voler.
Commandant !
Rapport de l'escadron Rouge
Une zone de montagnes, ici.
Visibilité améliorée à 15 clicks, peut-être.
- C'est le mauvais coté de la lune...
- Excusez moi, commandant ?
- Presque impossible qu'elle ait pu y atterrir.
- Monsieur, nous recevons un signal
de la navette de Colonial One.
Ils demandent la permission d'atterrir.
Ils ont la présidente à bord, monsieur.
Pourquoi n'ai-je pas été
averti que la présidente venait ?
Il n'y eu aucune annonce.
Je ne savais pas qu'elle venait.
Allons-y.
Que le Colonel Tigh
l'accueille au sas,
Amenez-la à mes
quartiers, s'il vous plait.
Très bien.
Toute machine volante
a 4 contrôles de base,
Propulsion.
Inclinaison.
Assiette et roulis.
Où sont les tiens ?
Note de sécurité numéro 1:
Touche pas à ça !
Vous allez nous ordonner
d'arrêter les recherches ?
Je suis venu pour parler,
pas pour donner des ordres.
Ils devraient recevoir un ordre.
Pourquoi ?
Colonel Tigh.
Que devrais-je devrais savoir ?
C'est allé au-delà
des usages militaires.
C'est personnel. Pour le
Commandant comme pour Lee.
- A cause du Lieutenant Thrace ?
- A cause d'elle...
... et aussi de Zack Adama.
le fils défunt du Commandant.
C'est compliqué...
Ca prendrait environ
3 semaines à expliquer.
Vous avez 3 minutes, parlez vite.
Elle va faire pression.
Je suis avec toi !
Présidente Roslin.
Madame la Présidente.
Passons les formalités, vous savez
tous les deux pourquoi je suis là.
L'arrêt d'une mission de secours
d'un pilote est une décision militaire.
Foutaises.
Ce n'est pas militaire,
c'est personnel.
Aucun de vous ne peut laisser partir Kara Thrace
parce qu'elle est le dernier lien avec Zack.
Vous ne savez rien
à propos de mon frère...
Ne commencez même pas, Capitaine.
Vous avez oublié les priorités,
tout comme vous.
En des circonstances normales, ce serait
seulement triste qu'aucun de vous
n'arrive à faire le deuil de Zack
Dans cette situation, vous faites
courir des risques à vos pilotes...
Vous exposez la flotte entière à une possible
attaque, au moment même où nous restons ici.
Nous risquons une attaque...
depuis le premier jour.
Les Cylons ne s'inquièteront pas pour leur
patrouille pendant encore un jour au moins.
Colonel Tigh
combien de carburant a été
consommé pendant cette opération ?
43% des réserves.
Presque la moitié !
inacceptable !
Et les opérations dans
l'atmosphère de la lune...
ont mis hors-jeu 1/3 des vos chasseurs.
C'est totalement... inacceptable !
Foutaises !
Inacceptable... Quelque soit
vos sentiments à ce propos,
la récupération d'un pilote
est d'ordre militaire.
Très bien.
C'est militaire.
Bien...
Vous êtes tous deux officiers...
tout deux des hommes honorables.
et vous savez tous deux que vous mettez
en péril la vie de plus de 45 000 personnes
et le futur de cette civilisation...
pour vos sentiments personnels.
Alors maintenant si
vous deux, entre tous...
pouvez vivre avec cela...
alors l'espèce humaine
n'a plus aucune chance.
Réveillez vous!
Combat.
Attendez.
Ici le Commandant.
Arrêtez les recherches.
Ramenez tout le monde.
Préparez la flotte...
...pour un saut, vers
le prochain système.
Nous partons.
Ok, ou bien ça
marche, ou bien pas.
Ok... Ok...
Ici la propulsion, l'inclinaison,
l'assiette, le roulis.
J'ai le contrôle !
Ramène-moi à la maison!
Tu pues, mais tu es une
sacré machine volante.
Je veux que tu saches...
Je pense qu'elle se trompe !
Je pense qu'on en a fini
avec ce qui est arrivé à Zack.
Pas moi....
J'ai besoin de
savoir une chose.
Pourquoi l'as-tu fait ?
Pourquoi l'avons-nous fait ?
Pour Kara ?
Pour Zack ?
Pourquoi ?
Kara était de la famille.
Tu fais ce que tu dois faire.
Parfois on viole les règles.
Et si j'avais été à sa place ?
Tu n'as pas à demander ça.
Tu en es sûr ?
Si cela avait été toi...
On ne serait jamais partis !
Colonel.
Commandant.
Reprenez votre service.
Oui, Monsieur.
Les chasseurs sont à bords.
Les civils ont amorcés leur saut vers le
prochain système. L'horloge à votre ordre.
Démarrez l'horloge.
M. Gaeta, démarrez l'horloge !
Mme la Présidente, voudriez-vous
rentrer à votre vaisseau ?
Merci, mais je reste. J'aimerais voir
comment font les professionnels.
Comme vous voulez.
Exécutez le saut, Lt Gaeta !
Oui, Monsieur !
Horloge de saut activée.
- Navigation ?
- Go !
- F.T.L.?
- Go !
- Tactiques ?
- Go !
Opérations de vol ?
Contact !
Contact Dradis !
En approche...
Cap 0.6.0
Elliptique 3.0.8
- Suspendez le décompte.
- Suspendu !
Le contact est...
Alors ?
Un raider Cylon,
Monsieur !
Vous aviez raison.
ce n'était qu'une question de temps.
Il suit une trajectoire d'interception.
Il sera sur nous avant la fin du Saut.
Postes de combats.
Lancez les Vipers.
<i>Postes de Combat, Postes de Combat.
Lancez les Chasseurs d'Alerte.</i>
<i>Raider Cylon en approche.</i>
Okay...
Maintenant regardez...
avant de tirer, s'il vous plait !
Les officiers-artilleurs signalent
que les armes sont prêtes.
- Où diables sont les Vipers ?!
- La plupart refont le plein.
Hotdog et Apollo
sont dans les tubes.
<i>Viper One.
Feu vert !</i>
NAVCON Clear !
<i>Pannes mécaniques,
Annulez le lancement.</i>
<i>MERDE !</i>
<i>Merde !</i>
On dirait que
j'y vais en solo.
Pourquoi un seul Cylon,
cette fois-ci ?
Peut-être un éclaireur.
Ou l'avant-garde d'un Vaisseau-Mère
prêt à nous tomber dessus.
De toutes façons, on doit
l'abattre avant de pouvoir sauter.
Galactica, Apollo.
Cible en vue.
Quel idiot !
On t'a jamais appris les
protocoles d'interception ?
Okay...
On va devoir utiliser
la manière forte.
Wow, Ce salopard est bon !
Ils se rapprochent vite, les
canons ont une solution de tir.
Très bien.
Reste-là, espèce de...
Pas de cigare pour toi !
Juste un petit...
peu...
... plus près.
PAS SI PRES !
mais qu'est-ce...
Je l'ai perdu !
<i>Galactica, je répète :
Je ne le vois nulle part.</i>
Dradis ?
D'aucune aide, les
signaux se mélangent.
- Statut des tubes ?
- Toujours inopérationels.
On aura une vague de
Vipers dans 45 secondes.
Ca sera fini dans 45 secondes.
Oh merde...
<i>Galactica, le Cylon vole
en formation avec moi.</i>
<i>Juste au-dessus de ma tête.</i>
<i>Cette chose...
agit bizarrement !</i>
Passez le moi.
<i>C'EST STARBUCK !!!</i>
Quoi ?!
Répète, Apollo !
Galactica, sur le raider Cylon,
il y à marqué... " Starbuck ".
...C'est écrit sous
les putains d'ailes !
RAMENE LE AU HANGAR !
S'IL FAIT QUOI QUE CE SOIT :
DESCENT LE !
<i>Compris, Galactica, mais
croyez-moi, ça ne peut être qu'elle...</i>
<i>Cette chose vole avec
avec un sacré style !</i>
Maintenant ton
cul m'appartient.
Tu aimes mon nouveau jouet ?
Toi, quand tu veux un souvenir...
tu n'y vas pas de main morte.
Oh mon Dieu, tu pue
comme une latrine.
T'as envie de me donner un bain ?
Comment te sens-tu ?
Ca pourrait être pire.
Je n'ai pas d'ambroisie,
mais le doc...
... peut nous soigner
avec de chouettes trucs.
Ce n'est pas grave, non?
Le genou ?
Le docteur dit qu'il est trop tôt
pour le dire, mais te connaissant...
tout ira bien.
Kara...
Ouais ?
Tu as bien agi.
Vraiment bien.
Besoin de quelque chose ?
Un cigare m'irait bien.
Je m'en doutais.
C'est mon dernier,
donc apprécie-le.
Merci.
Repose-toi.

J'essaye de me rappeler à
quoi ressemble ton visage.
La courbe de tes lèvres, la manière dont
tes cheveux tombent, ton odeur.
Tu vois mon visage tous les jours.
Oui, mais pas comme ça.

Quel est le compte?
3 morts, 13 blessés.
-  Avez-vous distingué le kamikaze?
- Oui.
C'était lui, non?
Oui.
Je veux voir le maître d'armes
dans mon bureau, dans 10 minutes.
Un Cylon?
Les témoins oculaires affirment que
le kamikaze était un homme.
Les Cylons nous ressemblent maintenant.
Nous ressemblent?
Oui, ils ressemblent à des humains.
La chair, le sang...
Tout!
Le kamikaze était
une autre copie d'un homme
que nous connaissions
sous le nom de Doral
affecté en tant que responsable des
relations publiques à bord de ce vaisseau.
Nous avons appris qu'il y avait de
multiples versions d'un même Cylon.
Je veux que vous ouvriez
une enquête immédiatement.
Je veux découvrir comment ce Cylon,
ou n'importe quel civil, pourrait
passer à travers notre sécurité.
Il y a eu une série d'incidents
à bord de ce vaisseau, Monsieur.
L'explosion d'un réservoir d'eau,
la découverte d'explosifs à bord
d'un Raptor, et maintenant ça...
Où voulez-vous en venir?
Il me faut carte blanche.
Le pouvoir de suivre les
pistes, où que cela nous mène,
sans entraves du commandement.
Un tribunal indépendant?
Oui, Monsieur.
Vous l'aurez.
Merci.
Ce sera tout, Sergent.
Je recommande également d'alerter
le public de la menace Cylon.
Si il y a d'autres copies de
cet homme à bord de la flotte,
nous devons les retrouver avant
qu'elles ne frappent à nouveau.
Je prendrais ce conseil en compte.
Ce sera tout.
Messieurs.
Le révéler au public,
c'est un sac d'embrouille.
Garder le silence ne
nous a pas beaucoup aidés.
Peut être qu'en faisant la
lumière sur la situation,
nous déclencherons les évènements.
D'accord.
Hey...
Je vous en dois une.
Sir.
Colonel.
Passez moi la Présidente.
Ne pince pas le tuyau...
...là.
Tu l'as.
C'est bon, allons-y.
Alors qui est le premier?
Pourquoi  pas moi?
Hello, Chef
- Comment ça va, là haut?
- Salut.
Allez, donnez ça.
Allez.
Vous êtes les plus
lamentables des lamentables...
les plus crétins des crétins.
La seule chose que vous
aller faire avec ça,
c'est un aller simple à
l'infirmerie ou à la morgue.
Maintenant, ce soir,
après la nuit tombée,
Que l'un d'entre vous m'apporte deux fois
cette longueur de tuyauterie en cuivre,
un  appareil de chauffage,
et un épurateur de CO2.
Je vais vous montrer
comment il faut faire.
C'est bon?
Maintenant dégagez de là
avant que je ne change d'avis.
Merci.
Les gosses...
CAPRICA OCCUPE PAR LES CYLONS
KARL C. AGATON, HELO
17 jour sur CAPRICA
Il est vraiment très beau.
Tu le penses réellement?
Elle dit ça pour n'importe qui.
Tu n'es pas d'accord ?
Il est séduisant.
J'espère que tu es plus
convaincante que ça avec lui.
S'il veut me trouver, il se dirigera au
nord vers les forces Cylons qu'il a déjà vues.
S'il veut partir seul, il ira au sud,
en espérant trouver un autre
moyen de quitter la planète.
De toute façon, il n'appliquera pas
son plan avant la tombée de la nuit.
S'il se sauve, il meurt.
La réaction sera violente.
S'il y a d'autres Cylons à bord de nos
vaisseaux, nous devons les trouver.
Si on s'aide du public, ça sera
beaucoup plus facile.
Les gens seront choqués,
fâchés, terrifiés, paranos.
Il y a un prix à payer
en demandant l'aide du public.
Ils demanderont pour le moins qu'on
désigne un coupable.
Je mets en place un tribunal.
Et ce tribunal devra présenter
au public un nom
quelqu'un qui a foiré.
On ne sait pas si quelqu'un a foiré.
Un agent Cylon pénètre votre
sécurité, tuant trois personnes.
Un des vôtres a du foirer.
Ecoutez, voici ce que je pense.
Tribunal indépendant, ouverture,
transparence, ça sonne bien.
Mais après 20 ans dans la politique
je vous le dis, ces choses tendent
à avoir des retombées sur ceux
auxquels on s'attend le moins.
Je ne veux pas de chasse aux
sorcières entre nos mains.
Où étiez-vous lors de l'explosion?
Au pieux, lisant des nouvelles
à deux balles données par Socinus.
Aviez-vous vu le Chef?
Le Chef?
Il était dans l'hangar du pont,
relisant de la paperasse.
Comment le saviez vous,
si vous étiez au pieux ?
Je l'ai vu juste avant d'aller me coucher.
J'étais avec Cally jouant aux
pyramides dans le couloir.
Êtes-vous sûr?
Oh, ouais, ouais, elle joue bien.
Aviez-vous vu le Chef?
Ouais, il était là-bas.
Je veux dire, pas tout le temps, mais il
nous a rendu visite et
regardé jouer un moment.
Ok
Je montais la garde.
Aviez-vous vu le Chef?
Le Chef? Non.
Il n'était pas dans le hangar de pont?
Non.
Oh, attendez, ouais.
Ouais, ouais, il y était.
Il est venu, pour travailler sur
un Viper piloté par le Capitaine.
Merci.
Je dormais dans ma piole.
En êtes-vous sûr?
Affirmatif.
Je dormais, Sergent.
Ok. Ca sera tout pour maintenant.
- Qu'avez-vous?
- Un ordre...
Bonsoir et merci d'être venus.
Asseyez-vous.
Je suis sûre qu'à présent
toute la flotte est informée
de l'explosion sur le Galactica.
Nous remercions continuellement
les courageuses personnes à
bord de ce très grand vaisseau.
Après consultation avec le Commandant Adama
j'ai désigné un tribunal indépendant
pour enquêter sur les circonstances
de cette explosion.
En outre, dans l'intérêt de notre sécurité
j'estime que c'est le moment de
vous révéler une information
restée jusqu'ici, ultra secrète.
Cette information n'était connue que de moi-même,
du Commandant Adama...
et de quelques conseillers.
La boite de Pandore est ouverte.
Les Cylons arrivent à imiter la forme
humaine. Ils nous ressemblent maintenant.
Nous croyons qu'un agent Cylon a été
responsable des explosions
sur le Galactica.
Cet homme a été identifié
comme un agent Cylon
Nous le croyons responsable de l'explosion.
Il a manifestement dormi sur le
Galactica avec un groupe civil
tué un marine
volé les explosifs et les a fait détonner,
tuant trois hommes de l'équipage
et s'autodétruisant.
Cet homme a aussi été
identifié comme un Cylon.
Nous savons qu'il y a des doubles
de chaque modèle Cylon.
Quiconque  apercevant l'un de ces 2 hommes
n'importe quand, n'importe où
devra immédiatement contacter
le Battlestar Galactica et
le bureau présidentiel.
Vos questions, maintenant.
Ils l'ont su tout le long, et ils
décident de nous le dire maintenant?
Un Cylon?
Cylon?
Je veux dire, qui est un Cylon, maintenant?
C'en est trop.
Je ne veux même pas le savoir.
Excusez-moi.
Lt, pouvez-vous venir avec nous, svp?
- Quoi, pourquoi?
- Que se passe-t'il, Sergent?
Chef, j'ai besoin que vous veniez aussi.
Vous arrêtez le Chef?
- Qui veux arrêter le Chef ?
- On arrête personne.
- Ca veux dire quoi, tout ça ?
- Reculez.
Le Lt vous a posé une question, Sergent.
Un tribunal a été installé pour étudier
l'infiltration du Cylon dans nos défenses.
La présence du Lt Valerii et du
Chef Tyrol est requise.
Et je suis là pour les escorter
jusqu'à la salle d'audience, Sir.
Très bien, continuez.
Merci, Monsieur.
Lt, Chef.
Veuillez me suivre, s'il vous plait.
Occupe t'en jusqu'à mon retour,
Et ne t'inquiète pas.
Lt Valerii, où étiez-vous
lors de l'explosion?
J'étais dans mon lit. Je dormais.
Quelqu'un vous avait-il vu, Madame?
Je ne sais pas, je dormais.
Lieutenant,
est-ce vrai que vous et
le Chef êtes engagés
dans une relation romantique et sexuelle
en violation du code
Colonial de la conduite militaire?
- Je pensais qu'il s'agissait...
- Répondez juste à la question.
Êtes-vous et le Chef engagés
dans une relation?
Non!
Le X.O. nous a ordonnés d'arrêter.
Donc on l'a fait.
Lt, pouvez-vous attester de
la localisation du Chef
au moment de l'explosion?
Aucune idée de l'endroit où il était.
Merci, Madame.
Vous pouvez sortir, Lieutenant.
Mais je suis sûr qu'il n'avait
rien à voir avec l'explosion...
Vous pouvez sortir, lieutenant.
Apportez-moi le prochain témoin.
Le témoignage que vous faites devant ce
tribunal peut être utilisé pour
prononcer votre culpabilité
ou innocence, dans cette affaire.
Comprenez-vous?
Oui.
Il s'agit tout d'abord de savoir
comment un Cylon a pénétré le
système de sécurité du Galactica
et, ensuite
si un des membres de l'équipage
a aidé ou encouragé ce crime
à travers la conspiration et
complicité avec les Cylons.
Complicité avec les Cylons....
Consentez-vous de témoigner librement
sans invoquer le droit de vous taire,
comme stipulé par le 23ème
article de la colonisation?
Oui.
Alors, commençons.
- Ils s'en prennent au Chef...
- Ils s'en prennent aux Cylons.
Ca veut dire quoi ?
Réveille-toi! Le monde a changé,
lorsque tu dormais, petit homme.
Va te faire foutre.
Les Cylons ressemblent aux
humains, à n'importe qui.
Pas le Chef.
- Comment le sais-tu?
- Je le sais.
C'est stupide.
Vous refusez simplement
d'accepter la réalité.
Vous vous voilez la face!
C'est exactement ce que les Cylons veulent:
qu'on s'en prenne l'un à l'autre,
qu'on devienne suspicieux, parano.
Elle a raison. Si nous ne nous
faisons pas confiance
alors on ne se couvrira pas mutuellement
quand ça va chier. On sera foutus.
Cette manière de penser est finie.
C'est chacun pour soi maintenant.
Vous feriez mieux de
surveiller vos arrières.
Vous étiez en garde avant
l'explosion, correct?
Oui.
Voudriez-vous expliquer au tribunal
ce que vous y faites?
Je parcours le périmètre du hangar de
pont, la salle des outils, le stockage.
Pour s'assurer que toutes les
écoutilles sont scellées?
Oui.
Qu'aucun personnel non autorisé
ne traîne la où il ne devrait pas?
Exact. Et il n'y avait personne
dans le hangar de pont cette nuit.
Je crois que c'est ce
que dit votre rapport.
Et à propos de l'écoutille du couloir C ?
Personne ne t'a vu ?
Non, je suis passée par l'écoutille du couloir C.
Vous avez écrit qu'on avait verrouillé et
scellé chaque écoutille et porte.
Si c'est ce que dit le rapport,
alors c'est le cas.
Ce qui inclurait l'écoutille du couloir C.
Je ne sais pas où le Sergent veut en
venir, mais ça n'a pas de rapport.
Et si je vous disais que j'ai trouvé
l'écoutille ouverte après l'explosion ?
Je vous dirais que je ne sais pas
comment c'est possible.
Et ce n'est pas n'importe quelle écoutille.
Elle conduit directement au
dépôt d'armes légères
où on a trouvé un garde mort.
Le dépôt a été ouvert avec le bon code.
Avez-vous le code pour ce dépôt, Chef ?
Oui, comme une douzaine
d'autres, le garde inclus.
Un Cylon a bien pu forcer le garde à
l'ouvrir, pour le tuer ensuite.
J'aimerais  aussi profiter
de l'occasion pour
signaler que c'était une question
de sécurité interne.
Cela est du ressort du maître d'armes.
Le maître d'armes est le Sergent Hadrian.
Le Lt. Valerii a-t-elle laissé
l'écoutille ouverte la nuit dernière ?
Je n'ai aucune idée de qui a laissé
ouvert l'écoutille la nuit dernière.
Chef
Remplissiez-vous de la paperasse
au moment de l'explosion ?
Non.
Chef, travailliez-vous sur un Viper
au moment de l'explosion ?
Non.
Regardiez-vous une
partie improvisée de Pyramides,
au mess au moment de l'explosion ?
Non, comme je vous l'ai expliqué plus tôt,
je dormais dans mon plumard
Alors pourquoi ai-je 3
dépositions différentes
de 3 de vos hommes de pont
affirmant vous avoir vu partout
sauf dans votre plumard.
Chef Tyrol, où étiez-vous
au moment de l'explosion ?
Etiez-vous, en fait, avec un agent cylon ?
Je demande l'application de l'article 23.
En invoquant l'article 23 maintenant,
le tribunal
évaluera ceci comme une autre
évidence de votre culpabilité.
Je vous le demanderai une dernière fois.
Avec qui étiez-vous au
moment de l'explosion ?
Etait-ce un agent cylon ?
Technicien, votre déposition
sous serment indique
que vous étiez de garde
lors de l'explosion
et que vous avez vu le Chef Tyrol
travailler sur un Viper.
Est-ce vrai ?
Oui, Madame.
Technicien,
pouvez-vous nous expliquer pourquoi
Le Chef nous a témoigné
être dans ses quartiers, endormi au moment de l'explosion ?
Parlez, Technicien!
Il a dit ça ?
L'avez-vous vu, ou non?
Technicien...
Non. Non, je ne l'ai pas vu, Madame.
Donc le Chef n'est pas venu
au hangar de pont après tout ?
Je ne sais pas, je... j'ai quitté mon poste.
Excusez-moi ?
J'ai quitté mon poste, Madame.
Je me suis faufilé dehors pour fumer.
Je suis allé aux cuisines
grignoter un truc.
Le Chef...
je ne sais pas où il était.
Je suis sûr qu'il dormait dans son lit
comme il l'a dit.
Vous êtes allé aux cuisines?
Oui, Madame.
Etes-vous passé par l'écoutille du pont C ?
Ca serait le meilleur chemin
pour aller aux cuisines.
Oui, Madame, je suis passé par l'écoutille.
L'avez-vous laissée ouvert ?
J'en suis pas sûr.
Oui, Madame, je le pense.
Mais le Chef n'a rien à voir avec ça.
C'était moi. J'ai quitté mon poste,
et laissé l'écoutille ouverte.
C'était moi, seulement moi.
Vous réalisez, n'est-ce pas, qu'en laissant l'écoutille ouverte
un Cylon a pu accéder
à un dépôt d'armes légères?
Oui, Madame.
Technicien, le Chef Tyrol vous a-t-il
ordonné de laisser délibérément l'écoutille ouverte
prenant part à une conspiration
permettant à un Cylon d'avoir accès au
dépôt d'armes légères ?
Le Chef est innocent, il n'a rien fait.
Technicien, avez-vous laissé l'écoutille ouverte délibérément?
Oui, Madame.
Quoiqu'il se soit passé, c'était moi.
Seulement moi.
Sud.
Tu as surestimé sa disposition
à risquer sa vie pour toi.
Il ne t'aime pas.
Attendez!
Nord
vers son amour.
On dirait que tu as fait
une impression, après tout.
C'est un homme bien.
Il fait toujours le bon choix.
Tu es prête pour la prochaine étape ?
Oui.
Bonjour, Lt.
Docteur.
Je vous ai apporté un cigare.
Cadeau de rétablissement.
Comment allez-vous ?
Je vais bien.
La nourriture est bonne
la compagnie des meilleure.
Oui, bien, Je...
passais par là et j'ai pensé
que je pouvais venir voir
comment vous vous en sortiez.
Alors, Docteur
Votre projet super secret est
sur le pont C, pas vrai ?
Je ne suis pas en mesure de divulguer
ce que je fais au pont C
mais vous serez toujours la bienvenue
dès que vous remarcherez.
Le kamikaze était sur le pont C, non?
Oui, je sais, j'ai entendu l'explosion.
Très effrayant.
Vous pensez que c'est là qu'il allait ?
Désolé, mais je ne vous suis pas.
La kamikaze Cylon.
Vous pensez qu'il voulait
faire sauter votre projet ?
Et toi avec?
C'est amusant.
Je n'y avais pas pensé.
Ca vous prend au dépourvu, hein ?
Oui, en effet
Vous vous remettrez vite.
Ils essayent de me tuer!
Moi, moi, toujours moi.
Ils essayent de détruire ton travail.
Te détruire est un bonus.
Mais pourquoi ?
C'est ce que je ne comprend pas.
Pourquoi veulent-ils me faire sauter?
C'est toi qui m'a dit de le faire.
Sans toi, je ne serais pas en train
de construire ce satané détecteur.
Mais je suis juste dans ta tête, Gaius.
Ils ne savent rien de moi, nous,
ou notre vie ensemble.
Comme c'est romantique.
Bien, je vais devoir détruire
ce détecteur Cylon moi-même,
dire à Adama que les Cylons
en sont responsables.
Tu ne le feras pas.
Tu vas finir ce projet,
comme je te l'ai dit.
Ah oui ? Je vais faire ça ?
Sinon quoi ?
Ne me mets pas en colère, Gaius.
Tu ne m'aimerais pas en colère.
Sharon ?
Ca suffit ?
Non, Sharon n'aurait pas
abandonné si facilement.
Avez-vous lu le rapport du tribunal ?
Oui, et je suis désolée de
lire qu'un de vos hommes
a été accusé de conspiration et
de complicité avec un agent cylon.
Le Technicien Socinus.
Mais après lecture des
transcriptions, j'ai des doutes.
Et à propos de l'autre homme,
le Chef Tyrol? Il a invoqué le 23ème article.
Pourquoi d'après vous?
C'est son droit.
La cour n'a jamais utilisé
comme preuve de culpabilité
le fait d'invoquer le droit au silence.
Vous parlez comme un avocat.
Mon père était avocat.
En droit civil.
Mettons de côté l'aspect légal,
pendant un moment.
Evidemment, vous défendez votre homme.
Je le respecte, vraiment,
mais il cache quelque chose.
Le Chef Tyrol a été sous mon
commandement pendant plus de 5 ans.
S'il voulait vraiment détruire ce vaisseau
il le pourrait. Je pense que ça suffit.
Madame la Présidente, je
vais devoir vous rappeler.
Quoi ?
J'ai ordre de vous ammener
devant le tribunal, Monsieur.
Allons-y.
Tout va bien.
Helo...
Comment tu savais que j'étais ici ?
Tu peux marcher ?
Je pense.
Viens.
Ok, ok
Maintenant on est quitte.
Je pense qu'on devrait y aller.
D'accord.
Viens.
Tout ira bien. Tu vas t'en sortir.
Commandant Adama,
quand avez-vous appris que les Cylons
avaient l'apparence humaine?
Sur la Station Ragnar, avant de partir.
Et vous avez choisi de dissimuler
cette information cruciale, Monsieur.
Oui.
Pourquoi?
J'ai estimé que prévenir le public
créerait seulement le chaos et la panique.
Mais...
Vous avez aussi dissumulé l'information à
la sécurité de votre propre vaisseau, Sir.
Ne sachant pas à qui faire confiance,
j'avais jusque là préféré restreindre
cette information à un cadre restreint.
Monsieur, est-ce vrai que si nous avions
su que les Cylons semblaient humains
d'autres protocoles de
sécurité auraient été suivis?
Probablement.
Mais je devais peser le
pour et le contre.
Bien, est-ce également vrai, Monsieur que si
on avait suivi d'autres protocoles de
sécurité, on aurait pu éviter l'explosion ?
Vous spéculez.
Je vous demande si c'est possible.
Je sais ce que vous demandez, Sergent.
Je ne spéculerai pas sur
ce qui aurait pu se passer.
Croyez-vous
qu'un agent Cylon ait mis des explosifs
dans le réservoir d'eau ?
Oui.
Croyez vous qu'il y a des agents
cylons en ce moment précis ?
Oui, je le crois.
Monsieur, est-ce vrai
que vous saviez
que le Lt Valerii et le Chef Tyrol
avaient une relation illicite,
en violation des règles ?
Je ne vois pas l'intérêt de
ces questions, Sergent.
Le Commandant devrait garder
à l'esprit que mes questions
ne sont pas sujettes à son approbation.
Pourquoi avez-vous permis à
cette relation de continuer
sachant qu'elle était
contraire au reglement.
Je suis un romantique.
Cdt, êtes-vous au courant que
le Lt Valerii et le Chef Tyrol
sont suspects de complicité avec les Cylons?
Je suis au courant de ces allégations.
Où voulez-vous en venir, Sergent?
Je pose les questions, Monsieur.
Est-ce vrai que, en autorisant
leur relation de continuer
en violation des règles,
vous avez donné la possibilité
à 2 collaborateurs Cylon
de compromettre la sécurité de ce vaisseau?
On a fini, ici.
Excusez-moi, Monsieur, mes
questions ne sont pas finies.
Vous vous égarez.
Vous avez oublié le but de la loi :
protéger ses citoyens
pas de les persécuter.
Quoi que nous soyons,
quoi qu'il reste de nous
Nous valons mieux que ça.
Maintenant, ces procédures sont terminées.
Vous serez reconduits à vos vaisseaux.
On a apprécié votre aide.
Commandant.
C'est une commission d'enquête indépendante.
Vous n'avez aucun droit de la fermer.
C'est une chasse aux sorcières.
Je refuse de l'avoir à bord de mon vaisseau.
Caporal
Retenez le Cdt. et ramenez-le
dans la chaise de témoin.
Vos ordres sont d'escorter
le Sgt Hadrian dans ses quartiers
et de l'y garder
jusqu'à nouvel ordre.
Fais ton choix, fils.
Sgt Hadrian, veuillez
nous suivre, svp.
Bonsoir, asseyez-vous.
L'enquête sur l'attentat
suicide sur le Galactica
et sur sa mise en oeuvre
est à présent fermée.
Vous êtes tous au courant que le
kamikaze était un agent Cylon.
Le tribunal a déterminé
que le Cylon a obtenu
l'accès aux explosifs en passant
par une écoutille dans le hangar
de pont du vaisseau.
La porte a été laissée ouverte
par la négligence
d'un des membres de l'équipage.
Nommément, le Technicien Socinus.
Il a confessé avoir menti sous serment et
manqué au devoir en temps de guerre.
Il a été dégradé,
et mis aux arrêts.
A ce stade, nous n'avons
aucune raison de croire...
que d'autres personnes
soient impliquées.
Maintenant, je réponds à vos questions.
Vous, Monsieur.
Commandant, je peux entrer?
Qu'il y a-t-il, Chef?
Merci, Monsieur.
Monsieur, je crois que Socinus...
Je crois que sa confession
était un mensonge.
Je pense qu'il me couvre.
Vous couvrir?
Je crois qu'il fait cela sous le coup
d'une loyauté excessive envers moi.
Il y a du vrai. Voudriez-vous m'éclairer ?
Mon Cdt, j'étais avec le
Lt Valerii lors de l'explosion.
L'équipe de pont; ils le savaient tous.
Ils l'ont toujours su. Pour me
couvrir, ils ont commencé à mentir.
Socinus...
je crois qu'il pensait
m'aider me protéger,
en prenant la responsabilité.
Vous ne savez pas s'il était,
oui ou non, en service, non?
Commandant, il est innoncent.
Je le sais
Je devrais être en prison.
C'est un fait. Vous devriez être en prison.
Commandant, ce n'est pas juste.
Vous ne pouvez pas
laisser un gosse innocent...
Je ne peux pas?
Ce que je ne peux pas faire
c'est laisser quelqu'un portant cet uniforme
aller à la barre des témoins
et mentir sous serment.
Et c'est ce qu'il a fait.
Il a menti la première fois,
ou la deuxième.
Et peu importe.
Il est coupable, et il en
assumera les conséquences.
Votre peine sera différente.
Vous devrez traverser cet hangar chaque jour
en sachant qu'un de
vos hommes est en prison
car vous n'avez pas pu tenir votre fermeture éclaire fermée!
Vous êtes le sous-officer le plus
expérimenté qu'il nous reste.
Vous vous occupez de mes vaisseaux,
j'en ai besoin.
Rompez!
Monsieur!
Sharon, non, non, non.
Quoi?
Sharon, nous en avons fini.
C'est fini.
Que veux-tu dire, c'est fini?
Je t'aime, vraiment.
Je suis désolé.
Attends.
Je mérite une meilleure explication.
Bien sûr.
Un de mes hommes est en prison.
Il a avoué un crime qu'il n'a pas commis pour me protéger, nous protéger.
On ne peut plus être ensemble.
Plus de secrets, de mensonges, ça suffit.
C'est fini
Je peux pas croire que tu
te détournes de nous.
Je mets tout en risque pour toi.
Tout.
Je te couvre, te protège.
J'ai risqué ma carrière, ma
liberté, mon intégrité, pourquoi?
Pour qu'un de mes gamins, puisse
prendre la responsabilité à ma place?
Non!
On en vaut pas la peine.
Ok.
D'accord.
Je supose qu'on se reverra.
Encore une chose:
As-tu laissé l'écoutille ouverte, cette nuit?
Quoi?
As-tu laissé l'écoutille ouverte, cette nuit?
Que veux-tu dire?
Que j'ai aidé le Cylon?
Je n'ai rien dit.
Je te posais juste une question.
Je pense que je mérite une réponse.
Tu as eu la seule réponse que tu auras jamais.

LES CYLONS FURENT CREES PAR L'HOMME
ILS SE REVOLTERENT
ILS EVOLUERENT
LEUR APPARENCE
LEURS EMOTIONS
SONT HUMAINES
CERTAINS SONT PROGRAMMES POUR
CROIRE QU'ILS SONT HUMAINS.
IL Y A DE NOMBREUSES COPIES
ET ILS ONT UN PLAN.
Tu m'ignores ?
J'ai décidé que tu es
une expression de mon...
subconscient se jouant de
moi lorsque je suis éveillé.
- Je suis seulement dans ta tête?
- Tu n'es pas vraiment ici.
J'y prête attention.
As-tu la moindre idée de ce qu'ils
me feraient s'ils découvraient tout ?
- Ils te condamneraient pour trahison.
- La trahison est passible de peine de mort.
Allez, Sharon, où es-tu?
Où es-tu, Sharon?
Helo...
Il faut qu'on y aille!
Maintenant!
Je ne vois aucun signe de Dieu ici
Devrais-je chercher ailleurs ?
Voyons...
Protéines... Oui.
Hémoglobines: Oui.
Empreinte divine...
Non. Désolé.
Je pourrais sûrement trouver la trace de Sa
divine main dans certains de ces mignons...
... petits échantillons.
Après tout...
Il y en a sacrément tant.
Je ne doute pas que même moi je puisse
trouver Dieu dans l'un d'entre eux.
Qu'est-ce qui te pousse
à blasphémer, Gaius?
Une envie de défier le destin?
L'ennui, en fait.
Je consacre la moindre
heure d'activité à...
ce qu'on pourrait voir comme ma
nouvelle religion personnelle :
" L'Eglise du Mystique
Détecteur à Cylons ".
Bien.
Tu as fini ?
Si tu t'abandonnais
à la Volonté Divine...
tu trouverais la paix
dans Son amour, comme moi.
Peux-tu m'aider avec
la fermeture éclair ?
J'ai des problèmes...
Il a un plan pour nous.
Comment sais-tu
qu'il s'agit d'un "Il" ?
Il n'y a qu'un seul...
Véritable Dieu.
Vraiment ?
Tu...
Tu dois avoir un bug
dans ton programme.
Parce que tu répètes la même
chose encore et encore...
Bon, j'ai accepté
ton Dieu et tout ça...
Peut-on réinitialiser le disque dur ?
Il n'est pas "mon" Dieu, Il est Dieu.
Ouais, ton Dieu, mon Dieu,
le Dieu de tout-le-monde...
Il est assez grand pour
chacun de nous, pas vrai ?
Je t'en prie...
Je t'en prie...
Viens, travaillons à notre...
Illumination.
Tu dois développer une
relation personnelle avec Dieu.
Toi seul peut t'ouvrir
à Son amour éternel !
POUR L'AMOUR DE DIEU !
J'EN AI PLUS QU'ASSEZ !
Je m'efforce de sauver
ton âme immortelle, Gaius.
Mais tout ce que tu fais chérie,
c'est de m'ennuyer à mourir
avec ton délire superstitieux.
Ton...
ton charabia métaphysique.
qui, soyons équitable, séduit les idiots
semi-analphabètes qui représentent
la majorité du peuple
qu'aucun humain rationnel,
à l'esprit clair, ne
pourrait réellement croire.
Ce qui m'amène donc à...
l'inévitable conclusion,
que tous les Cylons sont, en-
Que les Cylons sont, en analyse finale,
à peine plus que des grille-pains!
Avec de superbes jambes.
C'est mon fantasme, voyons si je peux...
rêver de quelqu'un... qui serait...
une brunette, peut-être.
Quoi ?
On pourrait peut-être
passer les préliminaires
et passer tout de suite au...
Qu'avez-vous dit ?!
Ca! ho...
Non, ce n'est rien, j'étais...
Je me parlais à moi-même.
A moi-même.
Fusillez-moi.
Le Commandant souhaite
vous voir au C.I.C. docteur.
Tiens, te voilà...
Très jolie. Tu pourrais ouvrir
un bouton ou deux....
- Excusez-moi ?!
... Vous vouliez me voir, Commandant ?
Miss Godfree m'a fait part
d'accusations très troublantes...
Je pense que vous devriez
avoir une chance d'y répondre...
en personne.
Wow,  merci, et euh...
Elle est...
Juste à côté de vous.
- Je suis là.
-  Mais oui, bien sûr...
Docteur ?
Voici... Miss Godfree.
Je me demande
s'ils peuvent te voir...
Vous pouvez tous la voir ?!
Elle se tient juste à côté de vous.
Quelque chose ne va pas ?
Non  !
Ne m'énerve pas, Gaius.
Je dirais que tu as un gros problème.
A terre!
Oui.
Peut-être que je...
Vous devez me pardonner.
Miss Godfree, je... je suis
vraiment enchanté, bien que...
un peu surpris,
de faire votre connaissance.
Ne me...
touchez pas, sale traître !
Elle m'a parlé !
Vous m'avez parlé ?!
Vous êtes celui qui a permit aux
Cylons d'accéder au système de défense.
Vous avez trahi toute votre espèce.
Vous êtes le responsable
de l'holocauste.
Je suis là pour vous
que vous soyez jugé
et condamné à mort comme le
traître que vous êtes vraiment !

Episode 7 - "Six degrees of Separation"
Sous-titres : " The Lords of Kobol "
-={ Serietele.net }=-
Resynchro version skyone altern. par yalou
Docteur,
Miss Godfree a fait des
accusations stupéfiantes.
Je n'avais encore jamais vu
cette femme, de toute ma vie!
Pas étonnant que vous ne
vous souveniez pas de moi,
je n'étais qu'une petite analyste des
systèmes au ministère de la défense.
Le Dr. Amarak était mon binôme.
D'après elle vous auriez
vendu toute la race humaine.
Donné aux Cylons l'accès
à nos plans de défense.
Le Dr. Amarak m'a dit
qu'il avait la preuve...
que le Dr. Baltar était
impliqué dans l'attaque surprise.
Il essayait de joindre la Présidente et de
lui donner cette information quand il fut tué.
- Il vous a dit ça, hein ?
- Il se trouve que oui !
Quel dommage qu'il ne
soit plus parmi nous !
Comme c'est pratique que nous
n'ayons que votre parole, ici !
Il y a aussi ceci...
Rien à foutre !
Il m'a confié ceci
pour le mettre à l'abri.
Il y a un code ID.
"Ministère de la Défense Coloniale".
Le Dr. Amarak m'a confié
le disque avant sa mort.
Comme s'il aurait pu le fait avant sa mort ?
Amarak m'a confié le disque
pour le mettre à l'abri.
Sur le disque il y a une photo.
Prise d'une caméra de sécurité
du Centre de la Défense sur Caprica.
Elle montre le docteur...
... entrant dans le centre sans
autorisation, le jour précédent l'attaque.
Rien de criminel là-dedans.
Comme vous pouvez le voir, l'homme sur
la photo transporte un engin explosif.
Pardon, il... quoi ?!
Il...
Je n'ai certainement
jamais fait ça !
Juste avant l'attaque Cylon, le Centre de
la défense fut détruit, par cet appareil !
Sincèrement, ce n'est pas moi.
Je n'y étais pas... c'est...
...quelqu'un d'autre.
Ecoutez, ce n'est pas moi. Je
ne suis pas l'homme de la photo !
Je vois un homme.
Même taille, même corpulence, mais...
c'est loin de constituer
une preuve, Miss Godfree.
Merci, Commandant !
A présent, si nous laissions
tomber ce petit jeu, je...
Je l'admet, Commandant,
mais regardez ici.
Dans la vitre du terminal.
Il y a un reflet du visage de cet homme.
On ne peut pas...
en dire grand chose.
Merci, Colonel Tigh !
Avec le bon équipement,
on pourrait agrandir
et mettre à net l'image
et voir son visage.
Agrandir l'image ne
pose pas de problèmes.
- Mais la mettre à nette...
- ...durera une éternité.
Ca prendra au moins 2 jours, Sir.
Mr Gaeta,
Faites-moi savoir dès
que vous avez une image.
Monsieur.
On va suspendre tout travail...
...sur le détecteur à Cylons.
Quoi ?
Ainsi que vos...
...privilèges de sécurité.
Les notes de Starbuck sur
le raider sont bordéliques !
Elle dit que la phase de
démarrage des moteurs commence
...en pressant quelque
chose ressemblant...
...à un ligament rouge avec des
veines bleues du côté droit...
Sortant d'un...sac
fait de gel
ayant la forme d'un... chien.
Tu te moques de moi ?
C'est tout un tas de...
veines et ligaments
et de sacs et de gel.
Pressez  le ligament avec votre main
- en déplaçant votre poids
- andouille de...
- sur votre hanche gauche
- ...Starbuck!
dans le sac lymphatique.
C'est vraiment con !
Bonsoir, monsieur!
Technicienne.
- Le Chef est là-dedans ?
- Ouais.
- Chef !
-  Oui, Colonel !
Ca progresse, là dedans ?
J'y arrive, Sir.
J'ai pas encore pigé tous
les trucs, mais ça vient.
Allez, Starbuck, tu peux le faire!
Ca brûle.
Oui, ça brûle.
Mais je...m'en...fiche.
Tu t'en fiches.
Je m'en fiche, parce que
te voir souffrir, m'amuse.
Vos béquilles de la mort, Madame.
- Faites-en bon usage.
- La ferme.
Ca va faire extrêmement mal
mais c'est censé le faire.
Merci, Doc.
Il faut souffrir pour être belle.
Aucun cliché ne
te sera épargné.
Kara Thrace reviens
parmi les bipèdes...
Peut-elle le faire ou bien
tombera-t-elle sur son cul ?
Je jure devant les Dieux...
Que vous allez me payer ça,
dès que j'irai mieux.
- Non, je ne peux pas.
- Si, tu le peux ! Tu l'as fait.
Vous n'irez pas mieux
en restant couchée.
Allez vous faire foutre.
Fais juste une pause
5 minutes, et réessaie.
Je ne veux plus,
Je veux une pilule.
Maintenant, s'il vous plait !
Désolé, on...
vous supprime les pilules magiques dès
aujourd'hui. En outre, j'en ai besoin.
Je trouve toute cette
affaire difficile à concevoir
-Je comprend que cela doit être horrible pour vous docteur
-Merci Madame le président
Je ne peux vous dire à quel
point ça compte pour moi.
Ecoutez, je me demandais s'il
y avait la moindre chance que...
...pendant que l'enquête
suis son cours...je puisse...
...revenir au Colonial one, J'ai...
J'ai laissé des choses à moi, là-bas.
Non, je suis désolée, docteur.
Vous avez l'interdiction
de changer de vaisseau.
Sécurité...
Madame la Présidente,
Je dois quitter le Galactica.
Il faut que je m'éloigne de cette
Shelly Godfrey surtout.
Elle en a après moi.
Où es-tu ?
Madame la Présidente.
J'ai des raisons de croire...
qu'elle pourrait être...
un Cylon.
Madame la Présidente ?
Madame la Présidente ?
Allô, Allô ?
Passez en transmission radio et appelez
le Doc. La Présidente s'est évanouie.
Madame la Présidente ?
Allô ?
- Billy, est-elle en vie?
- Oui, la Présidente est en vie.
Je vous l'ai dit, elle est
consciente et se repose.
- Elle suit un traitement
- De quel type ?
Je ne peux vous répondre.
On ne sait pas. On pense
à un début de grippe.
Combien en avez-vous
prises, jeune Dame ?
Une ?
Deux ?
Deux !
Trois...
Trois fois la dose.
Ca a donc agit trois
fois plus vite, non ?
Tout le monde voudrait
être son propre docteur.
Vous avez la chance, de
n'être pas tombée dans un coma.
Vous ne soignerez pas un
cancer par une overdose-
Les rumeurs courent dans
la flotte. Je suis désolé.
Pas grave.
Ca semblait être une urgence,
je ne pensais pas que quelqu'un
puisse capter la transmission.
Ne vous inquiétez pas,
ça ira.
La chose à faire maintenant est...
me remettre sur pieds...
...et aller devant la presse...
...avant la fin du jour.
Je pourrais vous faire une piqûre
mais vous n'aimeriez pas
les effets secondaires.
Faites...
...la!
Vous savez...
Le moment approche, où vous ne pourrez
plus cacher ce que vous traversez.
Ok
Ce n'est pas ici qu'il faut piquer.
Merci.
Baltar a raison,
sur la "commodité" de tout ça.
Amarak vous apporte comme par
hasard les pièces à conviction
- ...juste avant qu'il ne meurt.
- Quelque chose se tramait...
Il était presque paranoïaque.
Il répétait sans cesse que
l'Olympic Carrier avait été...
...infiltré par les Cylons.
Il  m'a fait sortir des choses
hors du vaisseau, par sûreté.
Pourquoi vous
l'a-t-il donné?
Nous étions amis.
Amis ?
Je l'aimais !
Je l'aimais beaucoup.
Parfois, je...
...me sens si seule.
Des moments, durant lesquels je veux
juste être dans les bras de quelqu'un.
Vous comprenez ça, non?
Bien sûr...
Il doit y avoir des moments, quand...
...vous vous sentez seul.
Et la pensée d'un autre
corps à côté du votre...
semble provenir d'un rêve.
En aucun cas, peu importe
les circonstances...
ne permettez à Shelly Godfree
de quitter ce vaisseau.
Surveillez-la, discrètement.
Je veux savoir à qui elle a parlé,
et les endroits où elle est allée.
Allez! Allez! Sharon, lève-toi!
Allez !
Karl C. Agatho Surnom:
Helo. 24e jour sur Caprica
Excusez-moi.
Lieutenant ?
C'est vous ?
Docteur...
Ce n'est pas une coïncidence.
Alors, euh...
Comment ça va?
Vous êtes occupé ! Je sais, et
je ne veux pas vous distraire.
S'il vous plait, ne me
laissez pas vous interrompre.
Toujours là ?
Ouaip.
Je sais que le moment
n'est pas approprié
mais je réalise que
Je n'ai jamais dit combien votre aide m'ait
été précieuse ces précédentes semaines.
Merci docteur...
Vous n'imaginez pas ce
que ça représente pour moi.
Pas du tout.
Pas du tout.
Alors, comment ça se passe ?
Au Labo ! bien sûr
je parle de la photo.
Bien, Bien. C'est que...
Ca vient assez... rapidement, en fait.
Plus que quelques heures.
Vous est-il déjà venu
à l'esprit que la photo,
et le disque lui-même
pouvaient être truqués ?
- J'ai déjà authentifié le disque.
- Vous l'avez fait, très bien même,
mais il y a bien des façons de contourner
cela. Si je pouvais vous aider au labo...
juste deux minutes,
je vous montrerais...
Je ne pense pas
que cela soit possible...
Gaeta, écoutez-moi,
personne ne le saura.
Ca restera entre vous et moi.
Rien que vous et moi.
Je sais.
Mais, bon Dieu, Gaeta,
ma vie est en jeu !
Ainsi que ma réputation !
La mienne aussi docteur.
Vraiment je...
Quelqu'un vient, il y a quelqu'un.
Où allez-vous ?!
Vous avez oublié
de laver vos mains!
Que Diable...
JE VEUX DES REPONSES, et
je les veux maintenant!
Tes jeux stupides
ne m'amusent plus.
Avez-vous perdu la tête ?!
Peut-être. C'est une question intéressante
une de celles que je me pose régulièrement.
Maintenant, Dis moi.
- Qui est l'homme sur la photo ?
- C'est vous !
Je n'ai jamais posé
de bombe nulle part...
Et tu le sais.
Je ne sais rien
de la sorte.
Maintenant, s'il vous plaît!
D'accord.
Admettons un instant que...
Tu n'es pas la femme
que je vois partout.
Tu n'es pas Shelly Godfree non plus.
Tu es un faux !
Tu n'es qu'une copie!
Une autre copie...
...Cylon.
Sor...
...tez!
J'AI TOUCHE JUSTE, N'EST CE PAS ?
JE TROUVE QUE C'EST
PLUTOT IMPOSSIBLE A CROIRE.
TU CROIS QUE C'EST FINI ?
CE N'EST PAS FINI !
JE N'AI PAS DIT MON DERNIER
MOT ! TERMINE LE GENTIL GAIUS !
Ah les femmes !
Fais chier !
Je tombe mal ?
Non, ça va.
J'imagine que t'as des problèmes ?
C'est juste que ce truc
veut pas fonctionner.
J'arrête pas de bosser là-dessus et...
RIEN!
Pas la moindre idée...
Comment Starbuck a fait
pour bouger cette chose,
et encore moins voler.
Ce n'est pas tout à
fait une "chose" tu sais.
C'est probablement
un Cylon lui-même.
Plus proche de l'animal,
que les modèles humains.
Ils l'ont peut être génétiquement
modifié pour remplir une tâche.
Etre un chasseur.
Tu ne peux le traiter de
"chose" et attendre qu'il réponde.
Tu dois le traiter comme...
...un animal de compagnie.
Du moins, c'est ce que j'imagine.
Ce que tu imagines ?
Oui, ce que j'imagine.
Autre chose à dire ?
Non...
Lieutenant,
On m'a dit que vous devriez
être sur pied désormais.
On vous a mal dit.
Je me disais bien que vous
ne récupéreriez pas si vite.
Y a t'il quelque chose que vous
voulez ? Où vous venez juste...
...me tourmenter, Colonel?
Ouais.
Le chef m'envoie vous sortir du lit
pour l'aider à comprendre
votre raider mais...
Vous avez visiblement besoin de repos.
Alors, prenez votre temps.
Y a pas urgence.
Vous croyez vraiment que votre
psychologie de bazar marche avec moi ?
Je me fous de ce que
vous pensez, Lieutenant.
Ce que je sais c'est que
chaque jour passé dans ce lit
confirme un peu plus
ce que je pense de vous.
Repos.
Et je suis convaincu qu'elle
est en fait un agent Cylon.
A mon avis il faudrait la mettre aux arrêts
avant qu'elle ne cause d'autres dégâts.
Où es tu ?
Alors, tu t'amuses ?
Ca t'amuse de mettre
le bordel dans ma vie.
Avez-vous des preuves à
l'appui de vos allégations ?
Le détecteur à Cylons
est quasiment prêt.
Après quelques...
menus réglages, j'aurai une machine de
test prête. Ce dont j'ai besoin c'est...
Un peu de tissu de cette
femme pour les analyser.
Je pensais qu'il y avait quelque chose
quelque chose...
...de spécial entre nous.
Je ne peux vous laisser
l'accès à votre matériel.
Mais sous mes indications,
Le lieutenant Gaeta pourrait
préparer ces échantillons.
Ca n'a rien de compliqué.
Laissez moi être franc, docteur.
Si c'est vous sur cette photographie
le moindre objet dans votre laboratoire,
sera démonté et mis en quarantaine.
Et toute les personnes
que vous avez côtoyées
seront interrogées.
Je t'aime...
Voilà, je l'ai dit.
Ne mourais-tu pas
d'envie de l'entendre ?
Bien, je suis disposé...
...à prendre cet engagement
avec toi, de suite.
La Présidente croit en mon innocence.
La Présidente espère
que vous êtes innocent.
Et moi aussi.
Parce que, si tel n'est pas le cas
alors vous vous êtes moqué de nous
et Dieu sait que je n'aime pas ça.
Et moi, je n'aime pas être accusé
d'avoir participé au génocide
de la race humaine, avec comme
seule preuve la parole d'une femme
que j'ai déjà indiquée comme
étant sûrement un agent Cylon.
Je ferai tout ce que tu me diras.
Quoique ce soit.
Je veux dire que j'ai
besoin de ton aide.
Je n'ai pas collaboré avec les Cylons!
Je suis un homme innocent
que tout le monde condamne déjà
sans procès.
Traître...
Alerte incendie !
Tous aux postes de secours.
Alerte incendie...
Frack !
Il n'y a aucun incendie
dans le vaisseau, Cdt.
Où a été déclenchée l'alarme?
L'intersection du corridor
de l'aile D, avec l'aile C.
C'est au labo.
Efface... efface !
Oui...
Oui!
LACHEZ CA!
Lâchez ça!
- Mettez- le en cellule.
- Oui, Commandant!
Je veux...
Je veux...
...parler à mon avocat.
JE NE PEUX PAS PARLER A MON AVOCAT ?!
J'AI BESOIN D UN AVOCAT, PERSONNE
NE SEMBLE COMPRENDRE QU'ELLE...
...EN A APRES MOI.
CETTE SHELLY GODFREE !
Hey !
Fermez-la.
Vous tous.
Plus un mot !
d'aucun de vous, Ok ?
Quel est le problème ?
Et bien votre nouvel petit-ami
est un naze Madame.
C'est une fille...
Si avoir de son gel sur votre
visage ne vous dérange pas,
...elle est à vous.
Elle aime la lumière.
Ca rend le contact plus facile, non?
Peut-être...
OK...
C'est stupide...
C'est stupide...
C'EST STUPIDE...
Ca vaut le coup d'essayer, Madame.
Et ça a déjà volé une fois pour vous.
Elle n'a pas bougé d'un cil depuis.
Vous pourriez...
l'emmener faire un tour.
- Un tour ?
- Traitez-la comme un cheval.
Un cheval, un cheval, un cheval...
Pourquoi pas une chèvre ?
je veux dire, c'est une chèvre, non ?
Imagine que c'est une chèvre.
Ok...
Peu importe.
Allez, petite !
Lève-toi !
Allez !
Allez !
Ok, allez !
D'accord, tu plaisantes !
Chef ?!
Chef !?!
Ne flinguez rien !
Docteur.
Madame la Présidente.
Je suis vraiment désolée.
Merci.
Vous êtes venue me libérer, c'est ça?
Pour mettre un terme
à cette mascarade, car
vous savez je suis innocent !
Dites-moi juste,
Que je comprenne, parce que...
je veux comprendre : Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi l'avoir fait ?
Je ne l'ai pas fait !
Ce n'était pas moi !
C'est un complot !
Pourquoi ferait-elle cela ?
Parce qu'elle est un Cylon !
Elle est un Cylon...
Vous devez me croire.
Je voudrais vous croire...
Je voudrais croire que je n'ai pu
commettre une telle erreur de jugement,
en vous faisant confiance.
Et en vous demandant conseil.
Mais on en est là, docteur.
Si tout le monde peut être un cylon,
et qu'il est difficile
de nous différencier.
Alors, nous ne pouvons faire
confiance qu'en une chose.
Nos instincts..
Nos émotions...
Au moment où ils m'ont dit que le
visage sur la photo était le votre.
J'ai su que j'y croyais.
Je crois que vous êtes
impliqué dans l'attaque.
D'une façon ou d'une autre
Je le sens.
Vous me pardonnerez,
Madame la Présidente
... si je ne souhaite pas être
exécuté seulement selon vos...
Sentiments à 3 balles !
Que les dieux aient
pitié de votre âme.
Pile ou face ?
Face
Face
Tu gagnes: tu dors, je surveille.
Non, c'est toi qui a besoin de dormir.
Je pourrais pas dormir si
je devais écouter Tyrol
réciter le manuel de vol.
Okay.
La vérité est que si
quelque chose t'arrivait
je ne saurais comment le supporter.
Tout comme moi.
De retour au vaisseau, je...
Ecoute, je savais ce qui se passait
je veux dire, entre toi et le Chef.
Comme tous le monde, je crois.
Et je respecte...
tes sentiments, les siens.
Mais j'aurais donné n'importe
quoi pour être à sa place.
Hey, je n'essaie pas
de t'embarrasser.
Je ne veux pas me mêler
de ce qu'il y a entre vous.
Tu ressens ce que tu ressens
et je dois l'accepter.
Je sais que nous n'avons
encore jamais parlé.
Et je ne veux pas être offensant.
S'il vous plait !
S'il vous plait !
Oh Dieu...
Et je reconnais que vous
êtes le seul vrai Dieu.
Délivrez-moi de ce mal
Et je...
je dévouerai ce qui reste
de ma misérable vie...
à faire le bien.
Réaliser Votre Volonté Divine !
Voilà ce que je veux faire.
Réaliser Votre Volonté Divine.
Je ne sais quoi faire.
Accordez-moi la grâce.
Accordez-moi votre pardon.
Je suis là maintenant.
Je suis là.
Tout ira bien.
Tout ira selon la volonté de Dieu.
Ouvrez la porte.
Attendez!
Je n'ai même pas encore eu de procès !
NON! non... attendez !
C'est un mensonge ! C'est un mensonge !
Docteur, tout va bien...
C'est un mensonge !
La photographie était un montage.
Quoi ?
Un travail quasi parfait, mais...
votre visage, l'homme,
le reflet... tout était faux.
Bien sur que c'est un faux.
Je ne porterais
jamais un tel t-shirt.
Comment vous avez...?
J'ai recommencé, relancé toutes
les vérifications de sécurité.
Cette fois j'ai trouvé des marqueurs,
qui... déterminent que
c'est un trucage photo.
Ils n'apparaissaient pas avant que
la photo soit complètement développée.
Vous avez relancé les vérifications ?
Merci.
J'ai juste...
... su que...
vous n'auriez jamais pu
être impliqué dans l'attaque.
Vous n'êtes pas
ce genre d'homme.
C'était vraiment rien, docteur.
Une fois que la photo était complètement
développée, c'était presque trop facile.
Comme si elle voulait être démasquée.
Comment a-t-elle
quitté le vaisseau ?!
Ca me dépasse, aucun
vaisseau n'est entré ni sorti...
- Je vous avais donné un ordre...
- J'avais 2 marines qui la suivaient,
Ils la suivaient mais au détour
d'un couloir, elle avait disparu !
Tous les vaisseaux ont fait leur
rapport, Monsieur. Aucune trace d'elle.
C'est inacceptable,
elle était là, juste là!
Cette femme était réelle,
Elle n'a pas pu disparaître !
Vérifiez encore.
- Tous les vaisseaux?
- Tous, celui-ci inclu.
Elle n'a pas pu disparaître.
Il a été victime ***
Clairement, les Cylons,
voulaient discréditer
le docteur Baltar à cause de son
travail sur le détecteur à Cylons.
Docteur Baltar,
c'est avec grand plaisir
que je vous disculpe publiquement,
et vous accepte de nouveau parmi nous.
En tant que scientifique,
leader,
et amie.
Tu es un héros...
Tu n'as jamais été aussi
populaire et puissant.
Tu as eu ton épreuve du feu,
maintenant ils croient vraiment en toi.
Difficile maintenant de
t'accuser de trahison.
C'était ça le plan,
depuis le début ?
Me faire gagner la
sympathie du public en me...
descendant d'abord?
Ok.
C'est pas à moi de remettre en
cause les plans du Dieu tout puissant.
Je veux juste poser une
petite question pratique.
Shelly Godfree !
Y a-t-il eu une femme
appelée "Shelly Godfrey"?
A- t-elle vraiment existé ?
Etait-elle présente ?
Que la volonté de Dieu soit faite!

LES CYLONS FURENT CREES PAR L'HOMME
ILS SE REVOLTERENT
ILS EVOLUERENT
LEUR APPARENCE
LEURS EMOTIONS
SONT HUMAINES.
CERTAINS SONT PROGRAMMES
POUR CROIRE QU'ILS SONT HUMAINS
IL Y A DE NOMBREUSES COPIES
ET ILS ONT UN PLAN.
Doral !
Quand ce corps mourra, ma conscience sera transfťrťe
dans un autre.
Les Cylons ont la capacitť d'imiter les formes de vie humaines.
Ils nous ressemblent maintenant.
Cette homme a ťtť identifiť en tant qu'agent cylon.
Tu dors, je surveille.
Non, c'est toi qui a besoin de dormir.
Vous avez la chance de
n'Ítre pas tombťe dans un coma.
Le moment approche, oý vous ne pourrez
plus cacher ce que vous traversez.
Laura.
Oui ?
Madame la Prťsidente,
tout va bien ?
Je vais bien,
Ce sont les effets secondaires du chamalla.
Vous savez ce qu'on dit : "Quel est le pire,
le cancer ou son remŤde ?"
De quoi avez-vous besoin ?
Vous avez un appel urgent
du capitaine du Geminon Traveler.
Je peux le rappeler ?
Il dit qu'il a trouvť un Cylon ŗ bord.
Ils l'ont trouvť dans le compartiment
de stockage tribord.
Apparemment, Áa faisait
des jours qu'il campait lŗ.
Ils sont sŻrs que c'est un Cylon ?
Le Capitaine l'a identifiť ŗ partir
d'une des photos que nous avons envoyťe.
C'est une autre copie de Leoben Conroy.
Oý est-il maintenant ?
ņ bord du Geminon Traveler
enfermť dans une rťserve, sous bonne garde.
Isolez ce vaisseau.
Ordonnez au CAP d'effectuer une
patrouille d'escorte du Geminon Traveler
et de n'approcher aucun autre vaisseau
de la flotte.
Oui Monsieur.
Kat, Galactica. Volez plus prŤs du...
J'envoie une ťquipe pour le dťtruire
immťdiatement.
Je veux qu'il soit interrogť d'abord.
PremiŤrement, ce n'est pas un Ítre humain,
c'est une machine.
DeuxiŤmement, on ne pourra
rien croire de ce qu'il dira.
La meilleure chose ŗ faire est
de le dťtruire immťdiatement.
J'aimerais entendre ce que cette chose a
ŗ dire, Áa pourrait Ítre important.
Madame la Prťsidente,
j'ai dťjŗ eu affaire ŗ ce modŤle.
Il va remplir votre esprit
de paroles trompeuses,
de philosophie de comptoir
et il va vous embrouiller.
Alors envoyez quelqu'un qui
ne se laissera pas embrouiller,
c'est un ordre, commandant.
Je veux qu'il soit interrogť.
Ordre reÁu.
Vous pensez vraiment que Áa va
nous apporter quelque chose?
Non.
La Prťsidente est d'un autre avis.
Donc, vous avez besoin que j'y aille,
je me douche et j'y vais.
Comment Áa avance?
On maÓtrise l'ťlectronique embarquťe,
le systŤme d'armes, la navigation
et je pense que je suis en train
de remettre ŗ zťro son moteur FTL.
J'ai fait Áa en vitesse
il y a 3 semaines.
C'est un rapport sur Leoben.
C'est une machine trŤs maligne,
manipulatrice, rusťe.
Le seul problŤme avec Leoben
n'est pas qu'il ment, Áa serait trop facile.
C'est qu'il mÍle mensonges et vťritť.
Rappelle-toi, il essaiera de s'introduire
dans ta tÍte.
Ma mŤre m'a toujours dit qu'elle ťtait
vide de toute faÁon.
Fais attention.
Il a un plan.
Son but est que tu ne le comprennes
que trop tard.
Ton travail est qu'il n'atteigne pas
son but.
Oui Monsieur.

Lieutenant.
Quoi de neuf ?
Rien.
Je voulais juste voir si ce que
je t'ai dit l'autre jour t'a ťtť utile.
Effectivement, oui.
On traite cette chose comme
un animal plutŰt qu'une machine
et Áa marche.
Comment Áa t'es venu ?
«a a juste surgi dans ta tÍte ?
Je suis un Cylon.
Tu sais, c'est mÍme pas drŰle.
Si je te prouvais que je n'en suis pas un,
Áa ferait une diffťrence ?
Tu sais, entre nous ?
Geminon Traveler, Raptor 719 avec ŗ bord
le Lt. Thrace, demandons autorisation d'apponter.
ReÁu 719, autorisation accordťe.
Il ressemble vraiment ŗ un humain.
Ouais.
«a doit Ítre rempli de c‚bles lŗ-dedans.
Non, si tu les dťcoupes y'a du sang,
des tripes, tout.
«a  transpire...
Bien, je...
Regardez moi Áa.
Dieux, ils se donnent bien
du mal ŗ imiter les gens.
Pourquoi ils font Áa ŗ votre avis ?
Je me fous du pourquoi.
Mais le fait que ces choses suent...
«a, c'est intťressant.
Endormi ?
En priŤre.
Je ne pense pas que les dieux rťpondent
aux priŤres des grilles-pains.
Dieu  rťpond aux priŤres de tout le monde.
Combien y a-t-il de Cylons
dans la flotte ?
Nous n'avons pas ťtť
correctement prťsentťs.
Je m'appelle Leoben.
Combien y a-t-il de Cylons
dans la flotte ?
Aucune idťe.
Quel est votre nom ?
Depuis combien de temps vous
vous cachez ŗ bord de ce vaisseau ?
Je n'ai pas le droit de connaÓtre
votre nom ?
Pourquoi vous vous cachiez
ŗ bord de ce vaisseau ?
J'avais une mission ŗ accomplir.
…coutez, ce n'est pas grand chose,
pouvez vous me dire qui vous Ítes ?
Parlez moi de votre mission
et j'y penserai.
Ma mission ťtait d'effectuer un sabotage.
Quel genre de sabotage ?
Mon Dieu, vous puez.
Peut-on avoir un peu d'air ici ?
Entre vous et l'humiditť...
Je ne suis pas lŗ pour jouer avec toi.
T'as dit que tu voulais coopťrer.
Parle, ou on en a fini.
Ok
Mais...
je veux vraiment connaÓtre votre nom.
Ouvrez.
 tes-vous le Lt. Starbuck ?
Oui, c'est vous. Je le savais...
J'avais raison, j'avais raison.
Je l'ai vu. Je l'avais vu.
Content maintenant ?
Tout prend son sens maintenant,
non ?
Maintenant nous pouvons parler
de plein de choses.
Comme quoi ?
J'ai cachť une ogive nuclťaire ŗ bord
de l'un de vos vaisseaux.
Elle est programmťe pour se dťclencher
ŗ 18h30.
Oý ?
Je ne suis pas encore prÍt
ŗ vous le dire.
Tu mens, il n'y a pas d'ogive.
Vous ne pouvez pas courir ce risque,
Starbuck.
Votre formation militaire vous dicte
de le rapporter ŗ vos maÓtres,
et de les laisser dťcider.
Peut-Ítre que ma formation
n'est pas terrible.
Peut-Ítre que je vais
te jeter dehors par le sas et leur raconter
que tu n'as jamais rien dit.
Qui ment maintenant ?
Ces choses n'arrivent pas sans raison,
non ?
J'espŤre passer un peu plus de temps
avec vous Starbuck,
on a un tas de choses ŗ se dire !
«a va Ítre marrant.
Mettez l'ťquipe RAD en alerte
immťdiatement !
Et scannez le Galactica ŗ la recherche
d'appareils radioactifs.
Bien.
Contactez tous les capitaines
de la flotte.
Dites-leur de faire un scan
radiations de leurs vaisseaux
mais insistez bien sur le fait que
ce n'est qu'une prťcaution.
Je ne veux alarmer personne
avant d'Ítre sŻr.
Oui, Monsieur.
Bien, nous serons fixťs dans 8h et 40min.
Lt Thrace, a-t-il dit autre chose ?
Non.
Il a... devinť mon indicatif.
Il a vraiment semblť content
quand il a trouvť qui j'ťtais.
Il joue avec ton esprit.
Ca fait des semaines qu'il est
en sťcuritť dans la flotte.
Il a pu entendre le mot "Starbuck"
de 36 maniŤres sur un poste sans fil.
C'est ce que je pensais, Monsieur.
Des idťes sur ce qu'il veut, Lt ?
Pas encore. Il dit qu'il est impatient
de passer du temps avec moi.
Ne prends aucun risque, Starbuck.
Oui, Monsieur.
Vous croyez aux Dieux, n'est-ce pas ?
Les Seigneurs de Kobol... et tout Áa ?
Pourquoi devrais-je vous rťpondre ?
Allez... ce n'est pas une question piŤge,
je veux juste
voir ŗ quel point j'ai raison, alors
vous priez Artťmis et Aphrodite ?
Oý est l'ogive ?
J'avais raison.
Nos croyances sont similaires sauf que
je vťnŤre un dieu unique, pas plusieurs.
Je me fiche bien de ce que vous croyez.
ConnaÓtre le visage de Dieu,
c'est connaÓtre la folie.
Je vois l'univers.
Je vois les trames.
Je vois les prťsages qui annoncent
chaque instant de chaque journťe.
Tout est lŗ.
Je le vois et vous pas.
Et j'ai une surprise pour vous.
Quelque chose ŗ vous dire sur le futur.
Vraiment ?
Oui.
Mais nous devons en terminer avec ceci.
Quel est le plus ťlťmentaire
des codes de la foi ?
Nous ne sommes pas
seulement cela.
Vous voyez, la diffťrence
entre vous et moi, c'est
que  je sais ce que cela signifie
et vous pas.
Je sais que je suis plus que ce corps,
plus que cette conscience.
Une part de moi
nage dans le fleuve
mais en vťritť, je me tiens sur la
rive et le courant ne m'emporte jamais.
C'est pire que sur le Galactica
et je ne croyais pas Áa possible.
C'ťtait quoi Áa, "nager dans le fleuve"
ou quoi ?
Permettez ?
Merci.
Je suis affamť, plusieurs jours
sans manger.
Une programmation plutŰt ratťe, non ?
AprŤs tout, pourquoi
se soucier de la faim ?
C'est une part de la condition humaine.
Tu n'es pas humain.
Comment est le repas ?
Vous savez ce que c'est,
quand vous crevez de faim,
tout parait bon.
C'ťtait douloureux?
Ouais, Áa fait mal.
Les machines ne devraient pas avoir mal.
Ne devraient pas saigner
... ni transpirer.
Transpirer, c'est amusant,
c'est bon.
Tu vois, un Cylon malin dťconnecterait
son programme douleur maintenant.
Mais je ne crois pas que tu sois si malin.
Peut-Ítre que je vais l'arrÍter et que
vous ne le saurez mÍme pas.
Voici ton dilemme :
dťconnecte la douleur
et tu te sens mieux
mais cela fait de toi une machine,
pas une personne.
Tu vois, les Ítres humains ne peuvent
pas dťconnecter leur douleur.
Les Ítres humains
sont obligťs de souffrir...
et de pleurer...
et de hurler...
et d'endurer.
... parce qu'ils n'ont pas le choix.
Alors la seule faÁon d'ťviter la douleur
que tu vas subir,
c'est de me dire exactement
ce que je veux savoir.
Tout comme un humain le ferait.
Je savais cela ŗ votre sujet.
Vous Ítes tout ce que j'avais
imaginť que vous soyez.
Mais Áa ne marchera pas,
je ne vous dirai rien.
Peut-Ítre pas.
Mais alors tu sauras, au fond de toi,
que je t'ai battu.
Qu'un Ítre humain t'a battu.
Et que tu n'es vraiment pas
supťrieur ŗ nous.
Vous n'Ítes qu'une bande de machines
aprŤs tout.
Les paris sont ouverts.
Salut.
Ah, regarde ce que le chat nous rapporte.
Lt. Valerii...
C'est une visite inattendue.
Vous avez l'air en forme.
J'ai besoin de votre aide.
Tout ce que vous voulez.
N'importe quoi.
On se demande pourquoi
ils l'appellent "Boomer" ?
On dit que vous dťveloppez un test...
pour diffťrencier les Cylons des Humains.
Bingo.
Je ne peux pas vraiment parler
de Áa, pour le moment.
Vous ne voudriez pas m'aider ŗ
clore un pari, par hasard ?
Alors, pourquoi vous appellent-ils
"Boomer" ?
Si vous travaillez sur un Dťtecteur ŗ Cylon,
pensez vous que je pourrais
Ítre dans la premiŤre vague ?
- ... Vous savez, pour Ítre testťe ?
- Pourquoi tant de h‚te ?
Pourquoi tant de h‚te ?
Je ne suis pas sŻr qu'il serait
appropriť de faire du favoritisme
si, en vťritť, je travaille
sur quoi que ce soit.
J'ai sauvť votre vie sur Caprica.
Mon co-pilote a donnť
sa place pour vous.
Et je vous ai ramenť sur le Galactica,
en lieu sŻr.
vous ne seriez pas lŗ si je n'avais
pas ťtť lŗ. Vous m'Ítes redevable.
Elle tire, elle marque.
Je suppose qu'il y a du vrai lŗ-dedans.
Alors pouvez-vous me tester ou non ?
Je crois que tu devrais le faire.
Les rťsultats seront des plus intťressants.
La technologie pour qu'un... Cylon...
soit dťtectť...
n'est pas tout ŗ fait prÍte pour
une application ŗ grande ťchelle.
Mais je pourrais faire
bon usage d'un sujet test.
CAPRICA SOUS OCCUPATION CYLON
Karl C. Agathon, 25Ťme jour sur Caprica.
Sharon est en retard.
D'une demi-heure.
Je remarque que tu l'appelles
"Sharon", maintenant.
J'ai dťcidť de la considťrer
comme l'une d'entre eux.
Parce que tu ne l'aimes pas ?
Parce que dans l'ordre des choses,
nous sommes ce que nous faisons.
Elle agit comme l'une d'entre eux,
pense comme eux...
Elle est l'une d'entre eux.
Mais elle est des nŰtres.
Ce serait bien de s'en souvenir.
Nous avons fait l'amour.
Fťlicitations.
- Est-ce qu'il t'aime ?
- Je le crois.
- L'a-t-il dit ?
- Pas directement.
Alors ce n'est qu'une supposition ?
Restez ŗ votre emplacement actuel.
Nous vous prťparons un local, ŗ proximitť.
Nourriture, eau, ťlectricitť. Tout le confort.
Tu  devrais pouvoir le persuader de rester
et de commencer ŗ vivre ensemble.
Sinon, tue-le.
C'est dans tes cordes ?
Nous sommes arrivťs jusqu'ici,
nous irons jusqu'au bout.
Si quelque chose t'arrivait, je
ne sais pas comment je le supporterais.
Caprica... Oui !
Si il fuit, il meurt.
Est-ce qu'il t'aime ?
Helo... Helo !
Hť! hť! Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
On doit partir, maintenant.
J'ai vu les Cylons, ils viennent par ici.
On doit dťcamper, et plus vite qu'avant.
- Pourquoi ? Qu'est-ce qui a changť ?
- Tout. Fais-moi confiance.
C'est le cas.
Maintenant, si tu ťtais humain,
tu serais tout prÍt ŗ nous offrir
de fausses informations
sur l'endroit oý se trouve l'ogive.
Un petit rien pour avoir une rťcompense
et qui pourrait t'ťpargner
quelques minutes de Áa.
Mais j'oubliais...
Tu n'es pas humain.
Tu es une machine.
Je suis plus que ce que vous ne pourrez
jamais imaginer.
Je suis Dieu.
Dťsolťe, tu es Dieu?
Wow... Ravie de vous rencontrer...
Elle est bonne, elle est bonne...
Je te donne quelques minutes pour celle-lŗ.
C'est drŰle, n'est-ce pas?
Nous sommes tous Dieu Starbuck,
chacun de nous.
Je vois l'amour qui lie
entre elles toute forme de vie.
L'amour?
Tu ne sais mÍme pas ce que
ce mot veut dire.
Je sais que Dieu vous a aimť
plus que toute autre crťature.
et vous avez rťcompensť son amour divin
par le pťchť, la haine, la corruption, le mal.
Alors il dťcida de crťer les Cylons.
Les dieux n'ont rien ŗ voir avec Áa.
Nous vous avons crťťs... Nous.
C'ťtait une putain de stupide dťcision
et nous avons payť pour Áa.
Vous avez massacrť toute ma civilisation!
Ceci est le pťchť!
Ceci est le mal, et tu es le mal.
Vraiment ? Je vois les vťritťs flottant
loin de vous dans le fleuve.
C'est ton idťe fixe les riviŤres
et les fleuves, non?
Je pense qu'on devrait
satisfaire ton obsession.
Vous rťalisez que je pourrais vous tuer
avant leur retour dans la piŤce?
Je pourrais me lever,
Arracher votre cr‚ne de votre
colonne vertťbrale,
l'ťcraser ŗ travers cette porte,
tuer le garde en moins de temps
qu'il ne faut pour le dire.
Pourquoi ne le fais-tu pas?
Ce n'est pas l'heure.
J'ai une surprise pour toi.
T'as merdť, camarade.
Maintenant on enlŤve les gants.
Ici le CIC, Colonel Tigh.
Oý en est la recherche de
la bombe nuclťaire?
Encore rien.
Il nous reste combien de temps?
2 heures, 9 minutes.
Dispersez la flotte.
Aucun vaisseau ŗ moins de
500 clicks d'un autre.
S'il y a une bombe,
limitons les dommages.
Oui, Monsieur!
Non.
Allez-y.
Laissez-le.
Madame?
Dits-moi oý est la tÍte nuclťaire
sinon tu vas te noyer dans ce seau.
Je ne peux pas me noyer.
Je ne peux pas mourir.
Exact.
Le Commandant Adama a dit que
si votre corps meurt, votre conscience est
tťlťchargťe ou transfťrťe dans
un autre corps ou un truc comme Áa ?
Non, exactement comme Áa.
Mais, tu vois, j'ai rťflťchi.
Pourquoi un Cylon voudrait-il parler?
Pourquoi ne s'en fiche t'il pas si on
dťtruit son corps? Il ne pourrait pas
se transfťrer ailleurs, se moquant de nous
et de nos stupides idťes humaines?
Dis-moi oý est la tÍte nuclťaire.
Ce n'est pas votre voie, Starbuck.
Vous avez un destin diffťrent.
Ne m'interromps pas.
Je vais t'ťblouir avec mon pauvre
cerveau humain.
Je pense que tu as peur,
peur que nous soyons trop loin
de chez toi.
Et si tu n'es pas transfťrť complŤtement?
Et si, en mourrant ici,
tu mourrais vraiment ?
Voilŗ une chance de savoir si
tu es vraiment Dieu,
ou bien un tas de circuits mal coiffť.
Je n'ai pas peur de mourir.
On vous a programmť un conte de fťes
avec Dieu, des fleuves et l'immortalitť
mais dans ce disque dur que vous appelez
"Cerveau"
il y a quelque part un bip-bip qui dit:
Erreur, Erreur, ne calcule pas.
Je n'ai pas d'‚me, j'ai un programme.
Si je meurs,
c'est pour de bon.
J'ai une ‚me.
Je vois les trames.
Je vous connais,
vous Ítes endommagťe.
Vous avez ťtť ťlevť par une femme
qui croyait que souffrir ťtait
bon pour l'‚me, donc
vous avez souffert.
La vie est une suite de douleurs,
de blessures, d'accidents.
Certaines infligťes aux autres,
d'autres ŗ soi-mÍme.
«a vous entoure comme une bulle
mais ce n'est pas...
...rťel. C'est juste... quelque chose
qu'elle vous a ancrť dans la tÍte.
Vous voulez y croire, car Áa
signifie que c'est vous...
le problŤme, pas le monde
dans lequel vous vivez.
Vous voulez y croire car...
Áa veut dire que vous avez la poisse.
Comme un cancer qui doit Ítre retirť.
Car vous entendez sa voix chaque jour
et vous voulez qu'elle ait raison.
Recommencez.
On glisse Áa dans la fente
et on attend les rťsultats.
Vert,
vous Ítes un Ítre humain normal.
Rouge,
vous Ítes un mťchant Cylon.
«a devrait prendre quelques minutes.
Alors... Dites moi,
Donc, vous Ítes d'Aerilon?
Une petite pointe d'accent...
Quoi? Non, Troie.
Troie.
Troie... Dites-moi...
Pourquoi cela m'est familier?
L'installation miniŤre?
L'accident.
L'explosion.
C'est vrai...
Ce fŻt tragique.
Votre famille...
...est morte avec les autres.
Je suis vraiment dťsolť.
C'est un mensonge.
Fťlicitations docteur, tu as dťcouvert ton premier Cylon.
Voici un moment intťressant
dans la vie de Gaius Baltar.
Que va-t-il faire?
Tout va bien?
Oui, oui.
J'interprŤte les rťsultats.
La question est,
que fera-t-elle si tu lui dis?
Te remercier ou te tuer?
Je pensais que c'ťtait juste vert ou rouge.
C'est un peu plus compliquť que cela
en fait.
Elle ne le sait probablement pas.
Elle pense Ítre une petite fille de Troie
dont tous les souvenirs ont disparu
dans un mystťrieux accident.
Intťressant de voir sa rťaction
quand tu lui diras la vťritť.
Je suppose que son cŰtť Cylon
prendra le dessus
et elle te brisera la nuque avant que
tu ťbruites son secret.
On va le savoir.
Fťlicitations, c'est vert!
C'est vraiment vert vif.
Vous n'Ítes pas un Cylon!
Vraiment ?
100% humaine et...
et aussi d'un vert trŤs vif!
Pendant un instant,
j'ai eu peur de votre rťponse.
- Ah bon?
- Ouais!
Bien, il ne faut plus s'inquiťter de rien.
Oui, impossible d'Ítre plus humaine!
Bien, merci.
ņ votre service.
J'ai quelque chose ŗ vous dire.
Dans combien de temps cette
soi-disant bombe explosera ?
Dans moins d'une heure.
Trouvez-moi une navette,
je vais sur le Geminon Traveler.
Je veux voir le Cylon.
- Madame la Prťsidente, vous devez reco...
- Ne commencez mÍme pas.
Je ne veux pas en parler, j'ai pris ma dťcision.
Pas avant quelques dťtails de sťcuritť.
Assez ! Par pitiť, laissez-le respirez.
Vous Ítes malade.
Vous n'Ítes pas une personne, vous Ítes une
machine qui apprťcie juste sa propre douleur.
Tout ceci s'est dťjŗ passť avant,
et se reproduira encore.
Ne citez pas les Ecritures.
Vous n'avez pas le droit d'utiliser ces mots.
Vous vous agenouillez devant des idoles
et leurs demandez conseils et vous n'Ítes pas
capable de voir que votre destinťe est dťjŗ ťcrite.
Chacun de nous joue un rŰle,
chaque fois un rŰle diffťrent.
La derniŤre fois, j'ťtais l'interrogateur et vous ťtiez le prisonnier.
Les joueurs changent, l'histoire reste la mÍme.
Et cette fois...
Cette fois,
Vous devez livrer mon ‚me aux dieux.
Faites-le pour moi. C'est votre destinťe,
et la mienne.
Et je vous avais dis que j'avais une surprise pour vous.
Vous Ítes prÍte?
Vous allez trouver Kobol,
notre berceau ŗ tous.
Kobol vous mŤnera ŗ la Terre.
Voici mon cadeau pour toi, Kara.
Que diable se passe-t-il ici?
Qu'Ítes-vous exactement en train de faire ici?
C'est une machine, Madame.
Il n'y a aucune limite ŗ la tactique que je peux employer.
Et oý est l'ogive?
Je ne sais pas.
Vous ne savez pas.
Vous avez passť ces derniŤres huit heures ŗ torturer cet homme...
ou cette machine,
quoi qu'il soit vraiment
Et vous n'avez pas la moindre information.
Il pense qu'il peut voir le futur.
Il dit qu'il connaÓt notre destinťe,
nos destins.
Il dit que nous trouverons Kobol
et que cela nous mŤnera ŗ la Terre.
Nettoyez-le, il ne reste pas beaucoup de temps.
Oui, Madame.
- Savez-vous qui je suis ?
- Oui.
Je m'excuse pour ce que vous avez dŻ endurer.
Retirez lui ses menottes.
Faites-le.
Merci.
Je peux faire plus.
Je peux garantir votre sŻretť, je peux ordonner votre libťration.
Nous manquons de temps, nous avons seulement
quatre minutes avant que votre bombe n'explose.
Je suis venue ici vous dire
que ce conflit entre nos peuples
n'est pas obligť de continuer.
Il peut s'arrÍter ici mÍme avec nous.
Nous devons nous faire confiance.
Croyez-moi.
Je pense que vous savez que vous pouvez.
Dites-moi ce que je veux savoir et vous vivrez.
L'ogive n'existe pas.
Je l'ai inventťe.
Le Lt. avait raison, j'ťtais trop ťloignť.
Je ne voulais pas mourir, donc quand
je fus arrÍtť j'ai inventť une histoire
pour avoir plus de temps.
Je vois.
Merci d'Ítre franc.
Merci, Madame la Prťsidente.
Ne soyez pas trop dure avec Kara, elle faisait juste son boulot,
les militaires...
ils
vous apprennent
ŗ dťshumaniser les gens.
Je prendrai ceci en considťration.
Non !
Laissez !
Laura, j'ai quelque chose ŗ vous dire.
Adama est un Cylon.
- Vous allez bien ?
- Je vais bien.
La bombe?
Rien.
Balancez-le par le sas.
Quoi?
Vous ne pouvez pas faire Áa,
pas aprŤs qu'il vous ait dit la vťritť.
Si, je peux. Et je le fais.
Lieutenant, regardez-moi.
Vous nťgligez la vision d'ensemble.
Pendant le temps que je lui ai permis de rester
vivant et captif sur ce vaisseau,
il a exposť notre flotte entiŤre ŗ la dispersion, sans dťfense.
Il a mis des idťes insidieuses dans nos esprits,
plus mortelles que n'importe quelle ogive.
Il crťe la peur.
Mais vous avez raison,
c'est une machine,
et vous ne gardez pas une machine mortelle prŤs de vous
quand elle tue votre peuple et menace
votre avenir, vous vous dťbarrassez d'elle.
Il n'a pas peur de mourir.
Il a juste peur que son ‚me ne soit pas ramenťe vers Dieu.
Seigneurs de Kobol, entendez ma priŤre.
Je ne sais pas si il a une ‚me ou non
mais, si il en a une, prenez soin de lui.
Vous avez pris un ťnorme risque aujourd'hui.
Quelque chose qu'il fallait faire.
Pour quelles raisons ?
Le Prťsident Adar m'a dit une fois
que la chose intťressante ŗ Ítre prťsident
est que vous n'avez pas ŗ vous expliquer.
Quelque chose ne va pas?
Non... rien du tout.

LES CYLONS FURENT CREES PAR L'HOMME
ILS SE REVOLTERENT
ILS EVOLUERENT
LEUR APPARENCE
LEURS EMOTIONS
SONT HUMAINES.
CERTAINS SONT PROGRAMMES POUR
CROIRE QU'ILS SONT HUMAINS
IL Y A DE NOMBREUSES COPIES
ET ILS ONT UN PLAN.
J'ai remarqué que tu l'appelles Sharon
Elle agit comme eux,
pense comme eux.
Elle est des leurs.
Mais elle est des nôtres.
On doit partir, maintenant.
On doit partir vite!
Même plus vite qu'avant.
Ils l'ont trouvé dans le compartiment
de stockage tribord.
C'est une autre copie du Cylon
nommé Leoben que vous connaissez.
Je vais envoyer une équipe
pour le détruire. On ne peut pas
faire confiance en ce que cela dit.
NON!
Adama est un Cylon...
Commandant?
Voici le rapport du Docteur.
La Présidente vous attend en haut.
Merci.
Libérez le pont.
Madame la Présidente,
nous sommes fiers de posséder
le premier Détecteur à Cylon dans l'univers.
Oui, bonne nouvelle.
Ouais...
Quand commençons-nous?
Le Docteur Baltar aimerait lancer un
test à grande échelle dès que possible,
Mais... Il y a d'importantes restrictions.
Il peut seulement tester une personne à la fois
et la vérification dure des heures.
Qui y va en premier?
Ah ok, les tests.
Je pense que les personnes dans les
positions-clef devraient passer en premier.
Je suis totalement d'accord.
Pourquoi pas vous?
Pardon?
Si vous êtes un Cylon...
j'aimerais le savoir
Si j'en suis un
vous êtes dans la merde.
Sérieusement.
Je pense que vous devriez y aller en premier.
Montrez à tout le monde qu'ils peuvent
faire confiance aux dirigeants.
Vous devriez y aller en premier, alors.
D'accord.
J'y vais en premier.
Je pense que c'est bien.
Vraiment.
Virage à mon signal.
Ouah.
Font-ils toujours ça?
Non, ils paradent.
Ils savent que je suis ici.
Oh...
Tu as un rendez-vous avec l'assistant
particulier de la Présidente...
ça se sait.
Donc c'est...
un rendez-vous officiel.
On délibère encore.
Vous n'avez plus que 2 minutes.
Tu pourrais profiter de ta position.
Et leur dire que tu es en mission
spéciale pour la Présidente.
Ton boss a plus de poids ici
que le mien.
Dis-leur qu'Adama veut que tu...
Ah oui?
Quoi?
Il veut que je quoi?
J'ai oublié ce que je voulais dire.
Comment va-t-il, en fait?
Le vieil homme?
Il va bien, je suppose.
Tu supposes?
Il a agit différemment, ces jours-ci.
Il parait un peu distrait.
Il a fait des appels bizarres
de ses appartements.
Tu sais?
"Top-secret"
C'est sûrement un truc de sécurité.
Pourtant, il ne veut pas que je note les appels.
Pas de dossier, rien.
C'est récent?
Il y a quelques jours...
Billy Keikeya
Me soutires-tu des informations
sur le Commandant?
Temps écoulé!
Bien sûr que non.
Bien sûr que oui.
Bien sûr que oui! Tu n'es qu'un espion!
Je pose juste des questions.
J'espère que les réponses te conviennent.
Car tu n'en auras pas d'autres
avant un bon moment.
Qu'avez-vous trouvé?
Dualla n'a pas pu l'exprimer
exactement, mais oui.
Elle  a dit qu'il se comporte différemment.
Pas difficile à remarquer. Il était
distrait et déconcentré.
Quoi d'autre?
Quelques... appels radios brouillés
qu'il ne voulait pas voir enregistrés.
Elle ignore qui il
a appelé ni pourquoi.
Mais cela ne prouve pas grand chose.
Les appels pourraient concerner la sécurité.
Son comportement étrange
peut être du stress pur et simple.
- Épuisement, paranoïa.
- Vous avez raison.
Ça peut être n'importe laquelle de ces raisons.
Mais  si ça ne l'est pas?
Madame la Présidente, sauf votre respect...
Je ne peux pas croire qu'on puisse penser
que le Commandant Adama
ait été remplacé je ne sais comment
par un double cylon.
Par les Dieux, Billy...
J'espère que vous avez raison!

Episode 9 - "Secrets and lies"
Sous-titres : " The Lords of Kobol "

Resynchro version skyone altern. par yalou
Le suicide est-il vraiment un pêché?
Un pêché mortel, je crains.
Mais ce n'est pas si mauvais, hein Gaius?
47 905 personnes dans la flotte.
Cela fait 47 905 échantillons de sang.
11 heures pour chaque test de détection
de Cylon.
Et bien ça prendra un moment.
21 956 jours.
60,1534 années.
J'y inclus quelques heures pour dormir
par-ci, par-là.
On peut même dire 61, n'est-ce pas?
Bien sûr.
Je préfèrerais me tuer.
Commandant Adama...
Êtes-vous un Cylon?
Ça ira mieux demain.
Difficile d'être un génie.
Oui!
Il devrait y avoir des avantages.
Oui!
Lieutenant Thrace!
Content de vous voir. Je...
Je m'entretiens avec quelques mouvements.
Je pense...
Je pense que c'est bon pour aujourd'hui.
Je me sens mieux.
Qu'est ce qui vous amène dans
...ce laboratoire à une heure si tardive?
On est au milieu de l'après-midi.
Oui, bien sûr, un travail de fou.
Je perds totalement
la notion du temps.
Que puis-je faire pour vous?
Fermer votre braguette.
Alors?
Mon test sanguin.
On a quelque chose Gaius
Il y a quelque chose de vraiment interressant à son sujet
Vraiment
Bien, très bien
J'aurais au moins fait ça.
Contact Dradis!
Un Raider cylon.
Cap 738, Inclinaison 005.
Ici Galactica à Apollo:
Un Raider cylon. Cap 738, Inclinaison 005.
Postes de Combats.
Engagez l'ennemi et détruisez-le, reçu?
On y est, Galactica.
Il est apparu juste devant nous,
l'erreur...
Combien?
Un seul Raider.
On dirait un éclaireur.
Apollo et Beehive l'ont déjà en vue.
Où est le Commandant?
Il n'est pas à bord.
Pas à bord?
Où diable est-il?
Il est parti en Raptor il y a une heure.
Sans plan de vol.
Sans plan de vol?
C'est ça Beehive.
Tu le coinces, je l'abats.
Je l'ai eu! On dirait
que j'ai touché ses armes.
Il a sauté!
Je répète: il a sauté avant que
nous le détruisions.
Merde!
Il donne sûrement notre position
à tous les vaisseaux mères maintenant.
Où diable est le Commandant?
Ordonnez à la flotte de commencer
les procédures de saut d'urgence!
Que tout le monde se donne rendez-vous
aux coordonnées d'attente.
Contact!
Un seul Raider!
Cap 881, inclinaison 247
Ici Galactica: un Raider cylon
a été détecté à 881; Inclin' 24...
Attendez, je le vois!
C'est le même Raider!
Quoi?
Oui, c'est le même Raider.
Je peux voir les dommages d'avant.
Son pilotage est erratique.
Il a sauté de nouveau!
Contact!
Un seul Raider, même lecture.
C'est comme s'il volait en cercles.
L'oiseau blessé ne peut
rentrer chez lui.
Ici Apollo: on l'a sur dradis.
Mais il est assez loin.
Il faudra 3min pour l'avoir à portée de feu.
Non!
Voilà une chance d'obtenir des informations.
Dites à Apollo de se rapprocher
du Raider mais de ne pas tirer.
Mettez  un Raptor dans les airs.
Tant que cette chose fait des petits sauts
un peu partout, dites-leur
de pomper chaque signal qu'il émet.
Oui, Monsieur.
Colonel, le Raptor du Commandant demande la
permission d'entrer dans l'aire d'atterrissage.
Permission accordée.
Mettez-vous en condition 2.
Commandant, permission accordée.
Monsieur Gaeta, vous êtes aux commandes.
Permission de monter à bord, Monsieur.
Accordée. Où diable étiez-vous?
Colonel Tigh...
Je vous présente votre femme.
Ellen!
CAPRICA SOUS OCCUPATION CYLON
KARL C. AGATHON
NOM DE CODE : HELO
28e JOUR SUR CAPRICA
Putain de bruit!
Je ne pige pas!
J'en ai explosé des centurions avant, et
ils n'ont jamais envoyé une armée entière...
Ils sont après moi.
Pourquoi toi?
Quand j'étais prisonnière,
j'ai surpris une conversation.
- Quoi?
- Des plans, du déploiement.
Une grande base cylon à Delphes.
Un important centre stratégique.
Delphes?
Putain de salauds!
C'est le meilleur endroit pour prendre
un vaisseau et se casser d'ici.
Dr. Gaius Baltar, département de détection
des Cylons. En quoi puis-je vous aider?
Vous êtes de bonne humeur...
Madame la Présidente...
Je suis...
Je suis désolé, j'attendais quelqu'un d'autre.
On ne s'est pas parlé depuis longtemps.
Docteur, je voudrais que vous m'appeliez
dès que le test du Commandant est fini.
Feriez-vous ça?
Il a annulé son test il y a peu de temps.
Pourquoi?
Je ne sais pas.
Il m'a donné un échantillon
selon lui prioritaire.
Celui de qui?
Je vérifie...
Une femme appelée "Ellen".
Que le prénom, il l'a déposé
et il est parti.
Y a t'il un problème?
Docteur, je veux que vous repreniez
le test du Commandant immédiatement.
Merci.
Je peux pas croire que tu sois en vie!
Moi non plus.
Saul,
Je ne me rappelle plus les dernières semaines.
C'est des semaines, non?
Ouais.
Tu étais sur le Rising Star tout ce temps?
Je le pense.
La dernière chose dont je me rappelle,
c'est d'être sur Picon.
J'étais à l'aéroport, au guichet.
Et...
J'ai entendu quelque chose sur les Cylons.
Et après...
Seulement des rêves. Principalement.
Jusqu'il y a quelques jours.
Ils m'ont dit que j'ai été
assommée lors de l'attaque
des Cylons contre l'aéroport.
Et...
Quelqu'un m'a pris avec lui
et m'a mis dans le dernier
vol pour l'extérieur.
Quelque sauveur,
Je ne sais même pas qui il était.
Tout va bien...
Tu es ici, maintenant.
On dirait qu'on a trouvé un bon filon là.
je veux dire qu'un des problèmes majeurs
avec le Raider récupéré est de
déterminer son saut le plus rapide.
Cet oiseau saute partout dans le coin.
Oui...
Et à chaque fois qu'il saute,
il nous donne des informations utiles.
Mais une question subsiste :
en premier lieu, que fait-il ici
et combien de temps peut-il tenir?
Dès que vous aurez les données FTL,
tenez moi informé.
Ne laissons pas cette chose traîner ici
plus longtemps que nécessaire.
Oui, Monsieur.
Vous vouliez me voir, Monsieur?
Restez là-dessus.
- Oui, Monsieur.
- Oui, Monsieur.
Tu as un dîner ce soir?
Quoi?
Viens.
Je croyais ne plus jamais revoir
ton visage.
Moi non plus.
Ce que j'ai dit avant, ce que j'ai fait...
Chuuuut...
C'est du passé.
Tout ça c'est du passé.
On repart à zéro?
On repart à zéro.
Je... Je dois...
Oublie ça!
Je  ne peux pas, je ne peux...
Je ne peux...
Je ne peux pas!
Je suis en service.
X.O.
Maintenant?
Compris.
Très bien.
Dites lui que je suis en route.
Une petite amie?
Du travail.
Comme au bon vieux temps...
Oui... Je t'expliquerai mais...
C'est top secret...
Je serai de retour dès que possible.
Je serai là,
à t'attendre...
Dès que possible...
Vous devriez faire très très attention
à ce que vous venez de dire.
Vous parlez d'un homme à qui
je dois la vie, et plus d'une fois.
Je sais que les temps sont troubles
et que la transition a été difficile pour vous.
Excusez moi,
Colonel.
Je comprends combien il est difficile
pour vous d'entendre cela, croyez moi.
Mais je vous conseille dès maintenant
de ne pas dire quoi que ce soit
que vous pourriez regretter.
Je dois savoir
si vous avez vu quelque chose de suspect
dans son comportement récemment.
Non.
Et à propos du fait qu'il ait quitté
le Galactica
sans dire à qui que ce soit où il allait
ou quand il reviendrait
et à ce moment précis,
un Raider cylon saute juste devant nous
et commence à agir bizarrement?
Je sais exactement où il était.
Vous le savez?
Il récupérait ma femme.
Votre femme?
Il s'avère qu'elle était inconsciente
à bord du Rising Star et ce,
depuis l'attaque.
Oh mes Dieux!
C'est formidable, c'est incroyable.
Oui... Ça l'est.
Quand Ellen est sortie de cette navette,
j'ai cru que j'allais m'évanouir.
Ellen?
Le prénom de votre femme est Ellen?
Oui, c'est ça.
Ellen.
Ellen Tigh.
J'apprécierais beaucoup de rencontrer
votre femme,
Colonel.
Reprendre le test d'Ellen...
Non! Non, il n'y a...
...absolument aucun problème.
Ellen?
Tu as fermé la porte?
Oh que oui.
Surprise!
Ambroisie, où as-tu eu ça?
Je sais m'y prendre...
J'ai pensé que c'était exactement
ce qu'il fallait pour une petite fête.
Il faut qu'on parle.
Les priorités d'abord.
On repart à zéro.
On repart à zéro.
Techniquement, je suis encore en service.
Je pensais qu'ils pouvaient se
débrouiller sans toi pendant un jour.
Ça ne marche pas vraiment comme ça...
On repart à zéro.
Oui!
Juste un petit peu plus...
Bien sûr il y a des gens qui pleurnichent
et qui réclament, vous vous en doutez.
Mais,
ceux à qui je parle sont plutôt
pleins d'espoir et optimistes.
C'est bon de l'entendre.
Bien,
certains pourraient toujours....
se demander si une institutrice
fait le poids en tant que Présidente.
Mais c'est une petite minorité.
Magnifique, magnifique.
Tout le monde est vraiment reconnaissant
envers tout ceux du Galactica.
Vous...
- Vous êtes nos sauveurs.
- On faisait notre devoir.
Tu es si modeste.
Il a toujours été comme ça.
Lee, pourriez-vous me repasser
un peu de cette délicieuse ambroisie
Bien sûr.
Merci, mon cher.
Bill, que tu dois être fier de tes fils.
Lee est devenu un homme séduisant.
Je ne peux qu'imaginer à quoi Zack ressemble.
Tu es le portrait craché de ta mère.
Et je pense que Zack est celui de son père.
Ellen. Zack est mort il y a quelques années.
Je suis désolée.
Tragique, la mort d'un enfant.
Il y a eu tellement de morts,
de souffrance.
Parfois, c'est complètement accablant.
Je suis sûre qu'il était un superbe garçon.
Le capitaine du Rising Star
ne savait pas trop dire
comment vous êtes arrivée à bord.
Oh, je sais!
Je sais juste qu'on m'a sauvée
d'une mort certaine
et qu'on m'a mise dans le dernier vol
quittant Picon.
Quelle chance pour nous.
En effet.
La chose étrange est que personne
ne se rappelle
vous avoir auscultée jusqu'il y a
une semaine.
Oh, je sais!
je sais...
C'est un miracle que je sois vivante.
Je vais débarrasser quelques uns de ces...
plats.
Vous êtes si adorable.
Très bien.
Mes compliments au chef.
Alors Bill, voici la question que
tout le monde se pose...
- Je dis bien tout le monde...
- Désolé...
Ça va...
C'est :
où est la Terre
et quand y arriverons-nous?
C'est top-secret.
- Encore ce mot.
- Ellen, laisse l'homme en paix.
Allez, s'il n'y a aucuns privilèges d'être
la femme de l'XO
alors à quoi ça sert?
Bill, on est en famille.
Allez.
Le besoin du secret est primordial, Ellen.
Et, désolée,
peut-être ne savez-vous pas que les
Cylons nous ressemblent...
Oh, ça! Oui...
Oui, je le savais.
C'est récent.
La plupart des gens l'ont
appris il y a quelques jours.
Les nouvelles comme ça vont vite...
On peut tous être Cylons.
BOUH!
T'as vu les expressions sur leurs visages?
Vous êtes trop facile à avoir.
Merci d'être venus,
à tout le monde...
Ça a été une merveilleuse soirée.
Je n'en voyais pas la fin.
J'ai perdu...
une de mes chaussures.
Elle est juste là.
Merci.
La voilà.
Vous semblez très heureux...
Mais je suis heureux, très heureux.
Merci...
j'ai été...
content de vous revoir.
Oh, tout le plaisir est pour moi.
J'espère qu'on se reverra.
J'en suis sûr.
Attends, attends...
Regardez où vous marchez.
- Bill, charmante soirée.
- Je l'ai.
Faites attention.
Vous pensez vraiment que
cette femme est un Cylon?
Si elle ne l'est pas...
On va avoir beaucoup d'ennuis.
Quand Bill est-il devenu si rabat-joie?
L'homme est une statue.
Comme un visage sur un totem.
Le potin c'était qu'elle couchait
avec plus de la moitié de la flotte quand
Saul était dans l'espace.
Mais pourquoi donc il l'a épousée?
C'est évident,
il l'aime profondément.
Aveuglément.
Par le passé Ellen encourageait
ses pires instincts...
A enclencher le mode auto-destruction.
Par le passé?
Sharon...
Stop!
Je n'en peux plus.
Helo.
Helo, allez!
Allez, tu peux le faire, s'il te plait.
Lève-toi!
Ici, juste ici...
Éteins ta lampe...
Allez, il faut qu'on trouve
une autre sortie. On y va!
Tu ne t'épuises jamais?!
Tu continues encore et encore
sans jamais te fatiguer.
C'est l'adrénaline.
Je ne vais pas mourir ici
et je ne vais pas te laisser mourir.
Ok, on y va!
T'inquiète, je nous ramène à la maison.
Oh, ok. Tout comme Bill nous emmène
sur Terre.
Ne commence pas avec Bill.
- Il ne sait même pas où se trouve la Terre.
- Tu n'as pas à le hurler dans le hall.
Bill ne sait pas où est la Terre.
Colonel?
Docteur...
En fait...
Je ne crois pas avoir déjà eu le plaisir...
- Je suis le Dr. Gaius...
- Baltar. Je sais parfaitement qui vous êtes.
Et tout le plaisir est pour moi.
Le courant passe bien, pas vrai?
- Vous retenez ma main.
- C'est amusant.
Je croyais que c'était vous
qui reteniez la mienne.
Je vous surveille.
Tous les deux.
Et tu devrais la surveiller.
Vous joindriez vous à nous
pour un dernier verre, Docteur?
J'aimerais bien.
Dr. Baltar, présentez-vous au labo.
Le Commandant vous attend.
Mais je ne peux pas.
- Une autre fois, peut-être.
- On compte sur vous.
- Oh, Saulie, serais-tu jaloux?
Tu disais qu'on repartait à zéro.
C'est le cas, chéri, c'est le cas.
Ce n'était qu'un petit flirt inoffensif.
- Tu devrais savoir quelque chose.
- Quoi?
Au cours du dîner...
Bill a posé sa main
sur ma cuisse.
Ellen, je ne tomberai
pas dans le panneau.
Savais-tu...
qu'il est venu me voir,
à bord du Rising Star?
Quoi?
Il est entré dans ma chambre.
Je faisais semblant de dormir.
Alors il s'est assis sur le bord du lit...
- et ensuite il m'a touchée.
- Pourquoi fais-tu ça?
Tu mens!
Non!
Il était sur ce vaisseau.
Et je vais te le prouver.
Viens!
Écoutez, il ne s'agit pas de magie
mais de science.
Vous voulez mon résultat,
il va falloir attendre un peu.
- Je vous ai donné cet échantillon ce matin.
- J'ai déjà entamé et stoppé 2 fois le test,
alors j'ai pris
un peu de retard.
- Deux fois?!
- Ma faute. Une longue histoire.
Votre faute?
- Je n'aurais pas dû en parler.
- Non, en effet.
- Lui avez-vous dit d'arrêter le test d'Ellen?
- Oui, je l'ai fait.
- Pourquoi?
- J'avais certains doutes.
A propos de quoi?
Franchement, je crois qu'on peut dire que
votre attitude est étrange ces derniers temps.
Mon attitude? Que croyez vous?
Que je suis un Cylon?!
Vous ne pouvez nier avoir passé ces...
appels non-référencés, ces escapades
mystérieuses hors du vaisseau.
Où avez-vous été chercher ça?
Vous m'avez espionné?
Sur mon propre vaisseau?
Messieurs dames, je vous prie!
Nous sommes dans un laboratoire,
Il y a des composants chimiques
instables un peu partout ici.
Ceci est une bombe thermonucléaire,
par pitié.
Qu'entendez-vous par
"non-référencés"?
"Escapades mystérieuses"?
Qu'est ce qui se passe?
Je devais me rendre à bord du Rising Star
et je ne voulais pas que Tigh le sache.
Pourquoi pas?
Que sa femme soit un Cylon ou non,
c'est une source d'embrouilles...
et je voulais la tenir à distance
aussi longtemps que possible.
Alors pourquoi l'avoir
amenée à bord?
Parce que c'est sa femme!
Je ne pouvais lui refuser de retrouver son
propre époux sans éveiller les soupçons.
En outre, je voulais
l'avoir près de moi.
Je te l'avais dit!
Je t'avais dit qu'il me voulait.
- Adorable.
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe, bordel?
Vous avez secrètement
rendu visite à ma femme?!
Non!
Oui, mais...
c'est compliqué.
- Je te l'avais dit. Il me court
après depuis des années.
- Quoi?!
Allons les garçons, ne vous battez
pas pour ma petite personne.
- Ellen, taisez-vous!
- Ne me dites pas quoi faire!
- Nous devrions respirer profondément.
- (Roslin) Je vais me gêner!
Je craignais qu'elle soit un Cylon!
J'ai apporté son sang pour le tester.
- C'est pour ça que vous avez annulé votre test.
- Comment savez vous cela?
Vous aviez vu la Présidente?!
Oui. Elle pensait que vous
pourriez être un Cylon.
Je sais.
Attention. Passez le mot
aux Cdt, XO et au CAG.
Cdt. Adama, Col. Tigh, et Capt. Adama,
veuillez vous présenter au C.I.C.
M. Gaeta.
Le Raider a dévié de son plan
de vol il y a environ 2 minutes.
Il semble hors de contrôle.
- Pourtant il ne saute pas pour rentrer.
- Non, Monsieur.
Notre reconnaissance a-t-elle détecté
la moindre communication sortante...
depuis qu'il a changé son vol?
Oui, Monsieur, mais ce n'est probablement
qu'un autre signal de détresse.
Lancez les chasseurs d'alerte.
Ici le CAG.
Lancez les chasseurs d'alerte.
Sir, je déteste vous dire ça, mais je crois
qu'il a joué avec nous depuis le début.
Il attendait de voir
comment nous réagirions.
- Jouer avec nous?
- Ouais.
- Ordre au chef d'escadre de détruire la cible.
- Oui, Monsieur.
Galactica, Hot Dog.
Le Raider vient de déguerpir!
Il n'a pas l'air touché.
Il va droit vers la flotte.
- Ils ne pourront pas l'intercepter.
- Postes de combat. Passez en Alerte 1.
Ce n'est pas un exercice.
Il n'est pas armé.
Il vient pour se crasher.
Vous avez lancé les chasseurs d'alerte?
C'était la décision du XO.
J'ai eu un pressentiment.
Bonne décision.
- Une question.
- Parce que je m'inquiétais.
- Qu'elle puisse être un Cylon?!
- Et qu'elle ne le soit pas.
Je sais ce que tu ressens pour elle, Saul.
Elle ne t'a apporté que des ennuis.
Désolé, mais c'est la vérité.
Peut-être autrefois.
Tout était différent avant.
Elle était différente.
J'étais différent.
Je me suis habitué à te voir
sans cette coupe à la main.
D'accord j'ai bu quelques verres ce soir.
- Je festoyais. Je crois avoir mérité de...
- Oui, tu l'as mérité.
En lançant ces chasseurs
sur un pressentiment...
Tu as sauvé notre vaisseau.
- Je ne faisais que mon boulot.
- Tu fais du bon boulot.
C'est pour ça que j'ai besoin de toi,
Saul.
Pour ça, et parce que nous sommes amis.
Je ne veux rien en travers
de cela, pas même Ellen.
Ça n'arrivera pas.
Nous avons fouillé chaque rue...
chaque immeuble.
Ils ont filé. Comment est-ce possible?
Elle croit l'aimer.
Qu'elle ne peut plus vivre sans lui.
Sa passion la rend pleine
de ressources.
- Ça te dérange, n'est-ce pas?
- Nous finirons par les avoir.
Non, ce qui te dérange c'est de n'avoir
jamais ressenti cela.
Tu as vu comment était Helo
quand il l'a emmenée?
Il était pathétique.
Je ne peux m'empêcher de songer à
ce que ça doit être de ressentir aussi...
intensément.
Même dans son tourment, il semblait...
si vivant.
Vert. Vert, tout le monde.
Mme Tigh est
incontestablement humaine.
Sans rancune, j'espère Ellen.
Je comprends parfaitement.
Mais soyons-en sûr en vous testant.
- Docteur?
- Avec plaisir... C'est mon travail.
Tu n'as pas envie de m'emmerder, Bill.
Essaye de t'en rappeler.
Ne m'emmerde pas non plus, Ellen.
S'ils savaient que tout le monde
réussit ce test ces jours-ci...
C'est beaucoup plus simple ainsi.
Pas vu, pas pris.
Alors...
Que disait vraiment son test?
Je ne le dirai jamais.

Battlestar Galactica
LES CYLONS FURENT CREES PAR L'HOMME
ILS SE REVOLTERENT
ILS EVOLUERENT
LEUR APPARENCE
LEURS EMOTIONS
SONT HUMAINES.
CERTAINS SONT PROGRAMMES
POUR CROIRE QU'ILS SONT HUMAINS
IL Y A DE NOMBREUSES COPIES
ET ILS ONT UN PLAN.
Mais votre docteur sur Caprica avait raison.
C'est bien trop tard pour opérer,
le cancer est trop avancé.
Avez-vous entendu parler
de l'extrait de chamalla?
Ca veut dire que t'agis comme si t'étais le
meilleur ami de tout le monde.
On est pas amis, t'es le CAG.
Le Chef voulait que je vous dégage du lit,
mais vous avez clairement besoin de repos.
Prenez votre temps, pas de precipitation.
J'ai besoin de nouveaux pilotes,
et je veux que tu les entraines.
Je peux faire ça.
Ils ont filé. Comment est-ce possible?
Elle croit l'aimer.
Qu'elle ne peut plus vivre sans lui.
Ça te dérange, n'est-ce pas?
Nous finirons par les avoir.
Je vous assure que la pénurie de carburant
est notre première priorité.
- Le Galactica envoie ses vaisseaux inspecter
les systèmes voisins et nous pensons
qu'il y en a sur le système Hamilton.
Madame, le tylium est rare.
Dans combien de temps
la flotte sera à cours de carburant ?
Tout dépend de notre consommation.
Est-ce vrai, Madame la Présidente, qu'il
nous en reste juste assez pour 2 sauts?
Oui, c'est exact.
Avons-nous un plan d'urgence
en cas de pénurie totale ?
Si... Si cela devait arriver,
nous utiliserions nos dernières réserves
pour sauter vers le système planétaire
le plus proche.
Et prier pour que nous ayons assez de
chance pour trouver une planète habitable.
Madame la Présidente, sans assez de
carburant pour une manœuvre d'évasion.
Non, euh...
- Nous serions des cibles idéales
pour les Cylons ?
- Oui.
Je... Je suis desolée.
Ça sera tout pour le moment.
<i>Début du balayage 87 du
champ d'astéroïdes.</i>
<i>Quelque chose?</i>
Combien de fois tu vas
me le demander Boomer?
Jusqu'à ce que tu trouves
du minerai de tylium.
Tu ne veux pas être un héros
pour l'Enseigne Davis?
T'as pas remarqué comme elle s'assoit
toujours à côté de toi au mess?
<i>"Comment ça va, Crash ?"</i>
<i>"Oh, t'es si mignon."</i>
Fait chier, y'a tellement de débris dans
ce système, le dradis est inutilisable.
- Ça va prendre 100 ans.
- J'ai entendu comment t'as trouvé de l'eau,
- comment t'as sauvé toute la flotte...
- Allez!
Jackpot Boomer! Cet astéroïde droit devant
est une montagne de tylium!
Regarde ça!
Loués soient les dieux!
- On est des héros!
- On est des héros ? Jamais d'échec...
Génial, Boomer,  2e fois que je marque et
le pilote arrive et récolte les lauriers.
- Ok, et qui a suggéré...
- Quoi, quoi ?
Les Cylons.
Les Cylons. Le rocher en grouille.
On est vraiment dans la merde.
Le seul tylium à 12 années lumières
à la ronde et on doit lui dire au revoir.
Tout comme nos fesses
si on se tire pas d'ici vite fait.

Il semblerait que les Cylons aient la
seule source de carburant à notre portée.
Ils se gardent chaque trou d'eau
du désert.
Sauf que cette fois, c'est un lac...
avec assez de tylium pour 1 ou 2 ans.
Ca doit être une sorte de tapis roulant,
pour amener le minerai de la mine
jusqu'ici, dans cette grosse usine.
- Une raffinerie, si loin de chez eux?
- Pourquoi pas? Ils ont autant besoin
de carburant que nous.
Maintenant ils l'ont.
Et assez de puissance de feu
pour le garder.
Donc on oublie cet astéroïde
et on trouve une autre source.
Je mettrai ma main à couper
que les Cylons la garderont aussi.
On envoie les Raptors plus loin à 10, 15
sauts pour trouver une source sans Cylon.
<i>Et utiliser tout le carburant pour ça.</i>
- Comment y amener notre vaisseau raffinerie?
- On prend le tylium aux Cylons.
Sauf votre respect, c'est pas le moment
d'attaquer une force supérieure.
C'est exactement le moment.
Nous savons où ils sont, et eux non.
On les prend par surprise
Si on échoue ?
Fin de la partie.
Donc nous n'échouons pas.
<i>Quand le missile s'approche
suffisamment de vous,</i>
Vous encaisserez peut-être bien 7 G
mais pour vous avoir, cet enfoiré
va devoir s'en taper de 40 à 60.
Son système de guidage ne peut pas
le supporter, et il vous ratera...
la plupart du temps.
Plus exactement, c'est combien
"la plupart du temps" ?
Ça dépend de votre jugement,
et de vos prières.
Garde à vous.
Repos.
- Lt Thrace, je peux vous parler ?
- Bien sûr.
Prenez 5mn les gars.
- Qu'est ce qui se passe?
- Comment ils s'en sortent?
Ils tremblent comme des nouveaux-nés
mais ils s'améliorent.
C'est bien.
J'ai un boulot pour toi.
La rumeur dit que vous préparez
une opération ?
La rumeur dit vrai pour une fois.
Le Capt. Adama et le Col. Tigh
travaillent sur un plan,
et j'aurais besoin d'un sérieux
coup de main hors normes...
Hors des normes, c'est là que je vis.
Je prends du chamalla pour
raison médicale.
Qu'avez-vous vu?
J'ai rêvé du Cylon qu'on a exécuté,
mais j'ai fait ces rêves avant sa capture.
Les images étaient...
-  Prémonitoires?
- Étranges.
Et maintenant, je... vois des choses
même éveillée.
Quel genre de choses?
Des serpents, il y avait des serpents
rampant sur mon pupitre
pendant la conférence de presse.
Combien ?
A peu près une douzaine.
Vous plaisantez n'est-ce pas ? Vous avez
lu la Pythie et vous me faites marcher.
Non.
Qui est la Pythie ?
Un des oracles, dans les rouleaux sacrés.
Il y a 3600 ans, la Pythie a écrit l'exil
et la renaissance de la race humaine.
Et les Seigneurs désignèrent un chef
pour guider la caravane des cieux
vers leurs nouvelles terres,
et à ce chef ils donnèrent
une vision de serpents,
au nombre de 2 et 10,
comme un signe des choses à venir.
La Pythie a écrit cela ?
Elle a aussi écrit que ce chef
serait gravement malade et qu'il
ne verrait pas le nouveau monde.
Mais vous n'êtes pas en train de mourir...
non ?
Et ça permettrait à notre groupe d'attaque
d'éliminer les installations ici.
Si on se débrouille bien,
il n'y aura aucun survivant cylon.
Et l'astéroïde sera à nous.
<i>Qu'en penses-tu Starbuck ?</i>
C'est plan est parfait sur le papier.
C'est pour ça qu'il ne marchera pas...
Bien sûr, nous nous inclinons devant
votre vaste expérience stratégique.
Rafraîchissez ma mémoire, de quelle année
est votre diplôme à l'académie militaire ?
- C'est quoi le problème Colonel,
c'est pas ça la vie de couple ?
- Ça suffit, tous les deux.
On ne gagnera pas celle-là sur le papier.
J'ai fait venir Starbuck parce qu'elle
ne s'embarrasse pas du conventionnel.
Avec tout le respect que je vous dois,
nous ne sommes pas aussi fous qu'elle.
Ok, que changeriez-vous alors?
Pour commencer,
faire sauter le Galactica derrière
le planétoïde pour le cacher des Cylons
est une manœuvre évidente.
Tu penses qu'ils couvrent leurs
angles morts avec des patrouilles.
C'est ce que je ferais.
Nous devons intégrer leurs patrouilles
dans notre plan.
Vous savez, faire marcher leurs tactiques
pour nous.
Voila ce que je ferais...
A la position code "deacon", il faudra
3 vaisseaux cargo civils comme leurres.
Ce qui veut dire qu'il faudra reloger
les passagers dans d'autres vaisseaux
déjà surpeuplés ?
Oui, si vous approuvez.
Les leurres feront un saut dans
le système stellaire ennemi,
à la limite de portée radar des Cylons.
Le Galactica sautera ici,
suffisamment près pour lancer
ses Vipers contre la base.
Dès que les leurres arriveront dans
le système, ils rompront le silence radio.
Ils se feront passer pour une
flotte minière venant pour le tylium
et ne sachant rien de la présence Cylon.
Les Cylons entendront les messages,
et leur enverront un groupe de chasseurs.
Ce qui laissera la base relativement
sans défense.
Nous aurons des Raptors pré-positionnés
pour surveiller les Cylons.
Quand  les Cylons iront vers les leurres,
les Vipers du Galactica
viendront par derrière,
et anéantiront la base.
Sans base ils...
ne pourront pas réarmer, se ravitailler...
On se débarrasse d'eux,
et à nous le tylium.
Et pour l'équipage des
vaisseaux leurres civils ?
Ils garderont leur moteur FTL prêt
et sauteront au moindre problème.
Combien de pertes en prévision ?
Il nous en coûtera.
Si vous réussissez, qu'est-ce qui empêche
les Cylons de revenir avec des renforts?
Rien.
Mais si on peut prendre cette base,
on gagnera du temps.
Pourquoi ?
Si vous fuyez un gros dur,
il vous harcèlera jusqu'au moment où
vous vous retournerez pour le frapper fort
au bon endroit...
Il y réfléchira à 2 fois avant de revenir.
Donc, c'est soit ça, soit être à court
de carburant et être annihilés.
Il faut parfois tenter sa chance.
Bien, les cargos sont à vous.
Bonne chasse, à tout le monde.
L'opération débute dans 48h.
Ceci est votre cible.
Une base Cylon.
Vous êtes l'expert en Cylons.
Nous devons détruire
leurs installations militaires.
Sans abîmer le minerai...
- ...de tylium sous la surface.
- C'est cela.
Une frappe nucléaire détruirait les Cylons
mais les radiations rendraient le minerai inerte.
Inutilisable.
Je comprends votre problème.
Vous avez de la chance vous savez.
Le tylium raffiné a une énorme enthalpie
de l'ordre
d'un demi milliard de mégajoules par kilo.
Soumis à la bonne chaleur et à une bonne
compression, disons,
celles d'une charge conventionnelle,
vous devriez obtenir une explosion
suffisamment dévastatrice sans
les retombées radioactives.
Tout ce qu'il faut faire
c'est frapper au bon endroit.
Vous devez frapper les plate-formes
de réservoirs de tylium pré-raffiné.
C'est beaucoup plus...
...instable que le carburant lui-même.
Et où sont-elles ?
J'ai besoin de toi sur ce coup-là.
Je suis flattée, Gaius,
mais je n'y connais absolument rien
en raffineries de tylium.
Moi non plus.
Allez, tu dois bien avoir une petite idée
de l'endroit à bombarder.
Non...
Mais Dieu le sait.
Oh, bien...
Je suppose que Dieu ne veut pas
que je détruise cette base car...
C'est le dieu des Cylons,
n'est-ce pas?
Dieu ne prend pas parti.
Il ne veut que ton amour.
Ouvre-lui ton cœur
et il te montrera le chemin.
- Ce serait plus simple si tu me le disais.
- Tu dois penser à abandonner ton ego.
Reste humble.
Si tu me le demandes,
Dieu pourrait se nettoyer les oreilles.
- Comme ça, il pourrait entendre
ce que j'ai à lui dire.
- Détends ton cou.
- Pourquoi, que vas-tu faire ?
- J'ai dit : détends-toi.
Très bien mais s'il te plait ne...
Où peuvent bien être ces plate-formes
de réservoirs docteur?
Euh...
Euh...
Là! Juste là.
Touchez n'importe laquelle
et la zone explosera comme une bombe
de trois kilotonnes.
Bien joué.
Si convaincant, si décidé...
Prononcé avec tant d'élan...
Il ne m'a pas parlé.
Dieu ne m'a pas parlé...
Alors j'ai menti sur toute la ligne.
J'ai juste pointé cet endroit au hasard.
Il ne parle pas toujours avec des mots,
Gaius.
Alors le sort...
de l'humanité toute entière se joue
sur ma réponse au hasard.
-  Garde à vous!
- Repos.
Comment va ce genou, Starbuck?
Il sera prêt.
Je ne rate pas cette fête.
Apollo dirige la force de frappe,
tu vas devoir t'asseoir sur celle-là.
Je suis votre meilleur pilote.
Pas actuellement.
Au combat tu devras tirer 6, 7 G.
Le docteur dit que ton genou
ne tiendra pas.
Et bien il a tort.
Ah oui ?
La pédale de propulseur d'un Viper...
a besoin de cette force...
pour s'activer.
Maintenant tu es sur une course d'attaque.
Tu lances tes missiles.
Tu vas devoir
enfoncer cette pédale...
dans le mur de feu
et tenir un virage à 6 G...
pendant dix secondes ou tu meurs.
Dix
Neuf
Huit
Sept
Six
Cinq
Quatre
Ça faisait seulement trois G,
Starbuck, pas six...
Je suis désolé, c'est dur...
mais tu vas devoir rester ici.
Garde ton entrée basse et rapide.
Utilise le relief pour rester caché
jusqu'à la dernière seconde.
Fais en sorte de donner assez de temps
à l'unité anti-DCA pour affaiblir
leurs défenses.
Tu ne me crois pas de taille pour ça.
Bien sûr que si,
ça ira.
Écoute,
tu crois que je ne pourrai pas me retirer
du feu avec un truc à haut-risque
ahurissant, comme Starbuck le ferait.
Et bien Kara, je suis désolé
que ça ne te convienne pas.
Parce que, crois moi, tout le monde
se sentirait bien mieux, moi y compris,
si tu volais avec nous.
Mais ceci n'est pas un problème d'ego,
c'est mon travail.
Et ne pense pas un seul instant
que je ne l'accomplirai pas.
J'espère,
parce qu'on a qu'un seul tir.
Ne le merde pas en réfléchissant trop.
Le bon côté d'être en fuite
après une guerre nucléaire,
c'est que personne ne se plaint
si on se cache dans sa grange ou
que l'on dévalise son garde-manger
sur notre chemin pour voler
une navette et quitter la planète.
C'est bizarre, non ?
Quoi  ?
On n'a pas vu un seul être humain en vie
depuis
celui sur qui tu as tiré, quand
tu m'as sauvé. Je veux dire,
Nous, on est en vie,
pourquoi il n'y a personne d'autre?
Probablement terrés dans des abris
anti-atomique ou quelque chose comme ça...
Deux sorties et une vue magnifique,
- Qu'y-a-t'il de mieux ?
- Un lit en plumes et des draps en soie ?
Tu as faim ?
Je ne sais pas, qu'est ce qu'il y a ?
Beurre de cacahuète...
Haricots,
Maïs.
Ça te dit du chili?
Un simple "non" aurait suffit...
Sharon,  as-tu pris des médicaments
anti-radiations?
Je pense que c'est les haricots froids
de cet après-midi.
- Ça va mieux?
- Ouais.
On est à combien de Delphes à ton avis ?
Huit, peut-être dix jours
si on voyage vite.
Si on part tôt, on y sera bientôt.
Tu n'arrives pas à dormir ?
J'ai jamais pu avant une grosse opération.
Le Mark II...
Bon vaisseau.
Il m'a tiré d'affaire plus d'une fois.
J'ai quelque chose pour toi.
Ça appartenait à ton grand père.
Ma mère le lui a acheté
quand il était en école de droit.
Tu as vu la gravure dessus?
Oui, je la distingue à peine mais...
C'était un meilleur père que moi.
Père l'emportait aux procès,
il disait qu'il ne perdait jamais, sauf
s'il l'oubliait.
Alors toi aussi tu es inquiet ?
À propos de quoi ?
Tu sais, des fois c'est comme si
tout le vaisseau pensait :
Starbuck
Starbuck ferait mieux.
Je ne le pense pas.
Comment peux-tu en être aussi sûr ?
Parce que tu es mon fils.
Repose toi.
Tu vas en avoir besoin.
Père...
Je te le ramène.
T'as intéret ou j'te botte le cul.
C'est un bon briquet.
Sharon, réveille-toi.
C'est quoi ce bordel ?
- Tu l'as tuée!
- Laisse moi voir...
On doit partir, tout de suite.
Attends un peu, je l'ai vue sur mes genoux,
- j'ai vu son sang sur mes genoux!
- On déménage, monsieur....
Mais qu'est-ce qu'il se passe là ?
Je ne sais pas, on verra ça plus tard....
Saut effectué, Monsieur.
Dradis ne rapporte que des parasites,
comme prévu. Je ne peux rien voir.
Nous sommes à portée de lancement
de la base Cylon.
<i>Carrier Constellation, saut effectué,
suis en poste, point deacon.
Commence manœuvre de recherche delta.</i>
<i>Vol minerai bravo, delta, message reçu.</i>
<i>Vol minerai nebula, delta commencé.</i>
Levez le rideau.
Vous pouvez parier qu'ils ont entendu ça.
Maintenant, ils vont essayer
de localiser les leurres.
Et quand ça sera fait?
S'ils mordent à l'hameçon,
ça va être une sacrée pagaille.
Et jusque là ?
On attend.
<i>Galactica, ici Boomer.</i>
Plus de 90 contacts en route vers deacon,
<i>Vitesse : 250.</i>
Les Cylons ont vu le cargo.
<i>Ils prennent un cap d'interception.</i>
Ils ont mordu à l'hameçon.
Mr Gaeta, lancez le groupe d'attaque 1.
Oui, Monsieur.
"D", lancez groupe d'attaque 1.
Attention: Pilotes, à vos appareils.
<i>Pilotes, à vos appareils.</i>
Ils ont mordu à quel point ?
Le rapport de Boomer dit plus de 90.
Ils ont lancé la plupart
de leurs chasseurs.
Faites-leur en voir, Monsieur.
Mise à feu.
Notre groupe d'attaque est parti.
J'espère juste que Lee puisse...
Lee n'est pas le problème.
Tu devrais te voir.
Je suis passé par la même transition.
Quand tu es dans le cockpit,
tu as le contrôle.
C'est difficile d'abandonner ça.
Ça aurait été plus facile
si je volais avec eux.
Tout ce que tu peux faire maintenant
c'est attendre et espérer n'avoir fait
aucune erreur.
Je n'ai jamais voulu ce genre
de responsabilités.
Les Cylons ne nous ont jamais demandé
ce qu'on voulait.
Bienvenue chez les grands.
<i>Galactica, ici Crashdown,</i>
<i>Plus de 50 contacts sur cap d'interception.</i>
Je répète, plus de 50 vers vous.
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Ça veut dire qu'une patrouille Cylon
a détecté notre force de frappe.
La base envoie 50 chasseurs en plus,
pour les intercepter.
50 chasseurs?
Nous sommes surpassés en nombre,
5 contre 1 ?
Les leurres ne sont pas censés
les occuper ?
Les Cylons sont trop malins pour ça.
Frack.
Temps estimé avant interception
du groupe d'attaque, 2 minutes.
Ici Fireball,
contacts multiples, gauche à 10 heures.
Distance 40, feu à volonté, en engagement.
ici Hotdog, confirmation visuelle,
J'attaque.
Hotdog, virage à droite!
Fireball, tes six heures!
Je suis touché! Je suis touché!
J'peux pas m'éjecter!
ici Deadbolt, Spinner,
2 en approche, droite à 5 heures.
Ça marche pas! Ça marche pas!
<i>Galactica, ici Hotdog.</i>
<i>Combat lourdement engagé,
mission compromise.</i>
Ça a l'air de foirer.
Ils se font tailler en pièces dehors.
<i>Maintenant! Maintenant! Maintenant!</i>
<i>Merde, tire-lui dessus, descends-le!</i>
Mr. Gaeta,
abondonnez la frappe 1.
Gorupe d'attaque 1, ici Galactica,
retournez à la base.
Je répète, abandonnez la mission
et retournez à la base.
<i>Galactica, ici Stubbs.</i>
<i>Les Cylons...</i>
<i>se détournent de deacon et vont vers
le Galactica.</i>
Les Cylons ont entendu notre rappel,
n'est-ce pas ?
Ça veut dire que la première vague
de chasseurs ignore les leurres et...
...et vient vers nous ?
C'est exactement ça.
Quand lançons-nous les Vipers de réserve
pour défendre le Galactica ?
Il n'y a aucun Viper de réserve.
Ils sont déja tous dehors.
Maintenant nous jouons toutes nos billes.
Starbuck, c'est ton plan.
Mr. Gaeta,
voulez vous, s'il vous plait, dire à "D"
d'aller sur le brouilleur et informer
Appolo que la porte arrière est ouverte.
- Oui, Lieutenant.
"D", envoyez un message brouillé
au Capitaine Appolo.
Le message dit :
"la porte arrière est ouverte."
Apollo, ici Galactica,
la porte arrière est ouverte.
Bonne chance, Appolo.
Lt. Thrace,
pourquoi ne m'avez-vous pas dit
que nous avions un autre
groupe d'attaque caché dans les cargos ?
- Nous, euh...
- C'est ma décision.
J'ai l'habitude de restreindre l'accès
aux détails tactiques
à ceux qui ont besoin de savoir.
On ne perd pas les vieilles habitudes
comme ça.
Alors vous pouvez encore nous tirer de là?
Si les renseignements du Docteur Baltar
sont justes.
Et si on ne se fait pas tailler en pièces
par ces chasseurs Cylons venant vers nous.
En parlant de ça,
je suis attendu au C.I.C.
Point de contrôle zéro dans 5 secondes.
Unité anti DCA dégagée.
<i>Ok, allons-y.</i>
Allez, Lee, tout repose sur toi.
Missile en approche!
<i>Feu à volonté, comme d'habitude...</i>
Cible en vue, accrochée et verrouillée,
<i>feu...</i>
accrochée et verrouillée, feu...
Qu'est-ce qui se passe avec
ces putains de missiles ?
Allez!
Ils brouillent les systèmes de guidage.
Groupe 2, ici Apollo, nous devons
nous rapprocher pour nous
passer du système de guidage.
<i>On va devoir faire exploser ça en manuel.
- Message reçu Apollo, c'est parti.</i>
Chuckles... Chuckles!
Oh, frack...
Chuckles est touché, il descend...
Ils ont identifié notre axe d'attaque.
Il n'y a aucun putain de moyen
de se rapprocher.
Frack... Il doit y en avoir un.
<i>On doit sortir de cette DCA.</i>
<i>Descendons plus bas que la plateforme,
plus bas que la cible.</i>
J'ai une idée.
Je vais voir ça de plus près.
- Commandant sur le pont!
- Repos.
La première vague de Cylons sera sur nous
dans trois minutes.
Avisez les Vipers du groupe d'attaque 1
d'arrêter de se sauver et d'envoyer
ces batards en enfer.
Oui, Monsieur.
<i>Attaquons les chasseurs Cylons.</i>
Cible en vue, accrochée et verrouillée.
Oh, non, ne fais pas ça Lee...
Le tunnel du convoyeur est dégagé,
je vais dedans.
T'as perdu ta putain de tête, Apollo.
Que se passe-t'il ?
Le Capitaine Apollo vole
à l'intérieur du tunnel du convoyeur,
espérant que ça le mène à la raffinerie.
Il est devenu complètement cinglé ?
Il n'y a rien qui garantisse cela.
Reste concentré Lee, reste concentré, reste...
Oh, Seigneurs!
Okay,
j'ai traversé le tunnel.
Ils ne peuvent pas me tirer dessus.
Vous voilà.
Okay... Je t'ai, je t'ai...
Ahh, Galactica,
ici Apollo.
<i>Mission...</i>
<i>accomplie.</i>
Vous pouvez dire au Dr. Baltar qu'il avait
raison. C'est un sacré feu d'artifices...
Et il y a plein de minerais pour nous
dans le canyon,
dès qu'on aura balayé cette base
Félicitations Docteur, ça a marché!
Tout à fait.
Ça a marché.
Oh...!
Désolée madame la Présidente,
je suis désolée...
Pas besoin de s'excuser, Lt.
Merci à vous, nous avons assez de
carburant pour des années.
Commandant, le groupe d'attaque 1 dit que
les Cylons fuient et demande la permission
de les suivre, Monsieur.
Dites-leur de les poursuivre
et de les détruire.
Affirmatif.
Groupe 1... Déchirez-les.
Apollo, petit salopard,
c'était une sacré démonstration de vol
- et j'aurais pas fait mieux.
- Désolé, je ne t'ai pas entendue.
J'ai dit que je n'aurais pas fait mieux.
Bien, merci.
Hmm. J'ai eu des doutes.
Moi aussi.
Je n'étais pas sûr que ton plan de cinglé
puisse marcher.
Tu le mérites.
Crash!
As-tu lu la prophétie de la Pythie,
Gaius ?
Pas depuis la primaire.
Je ne peux pas dire que
l'histoire ancienne soit mon sujet favori.
Tu aurais du écouter attentivement.
Quoi donc ?
Tout ce qui est arrivé avant.
Tout ce qui arrivera encore.
Tout le monde connait ce verset.
Où veux-tu en venir ?
Tu te rappelles de celui-ci ?
"Guidé par les serpents
au nombre de 2 et 10."
Les Vipers...
Ce sont eux les serpents.
Il y a un verset plus loin, Gaius,
Tu devrais le lire.
"Malgré le résultat favorisant le peu,
cela mena à la confrontation
dans la maison des Dieux."
Est-ce que tu es en train de me dire
que Dieu a guidé mon doigt
sur cette cible dans un...
obscur but biblique ?
Tu fais partie du plan de Dieu, Gaius.
Alors Dieu voulait que je détruise
cette base Cylon.
Tu as réussi.
Tu t'es abandonné à lui.
Oui, je suppose que oui.
Oui, il n'y a... Il n'y a aucune autre
explication logique pour ça.
Je fus...
"suis"...
Je suis l'instrument de Dieu.

LES CYLONS FURENT CREES PAR L'HOMME
ILS SE REVOLTERENT
ILS EVOLUERENT
LEUR APPARENCE
LEURS EMOTIONS
SONT HUMAINES.
CERTAINS SONT PROGRAMMES POUR
CROIRE QU'ILS SONT HUMAINS
IL Y A DE NOMBREUSES COPIES
ET ILS ONT UN PLAN.
Il se passe quoi, bordel?
Tu l'as tuée...
On doit y aller, maintenant.
- C'est Tom Zarek.
- Le terroriste ?
- C'est un prisonnier politique.
- C'est un boucher.
Il a fait sauter un édifice gouvernemental,
Il n'y a pas d'excuse à cela.
Vous avez dit me respecter.
C'était avant votre recours à
la violence et la prise d'otages.
J'exige la démission immédiate de
Laura Roslin et de ses ministres.
J'exige des élections libres et ouvertes
pour choisir de nouveaux dirigeants.
Vous laissez le reste des otages partir,
on laisse le vaisseau entre vos mains.
Tu l'as ?
Test. Voilà.
On est à l'antenne ?
Frack, on l'est. Allez, allez.
En direct depuis le Cloud Nine, le vaisseau le plus luxueux de la flotte
c'est le "Colonial Gang"
C'est un nouveau talk-show avec des scoops
sur les décideurs de la flotte.
Je suis James McManus,
anciennement du "Caprica Times".
Je me trouve avec les deux seuls
journalistes restant dans l'univers.
Playa Palacios, commentatrice vétéranne
pour le "Picon Star Tribune", bienvenue.
Et aussi, Sekon Hamilton ancien
rédacteur de la Gazette d'Aerilon.
Comme beaucoup le savent...
Le Cloud Nine a été endommagé
pendant l'attaque cylon...
et a du être évacué.
Les réparations achevées,
La Présidente Roslin a choisi ce lieu
pour un rassemblement historique.
C'est la première réunion du
Quorum provisoire des 12
qui coïncide avec le Jour des Colonies
le 52ème anniversaire de la signature
des articles de la Colonisation.
Playa, voudriez-vous intervenir ?
On devrait applaudir Laura Roslin...
pour avoir restauré le système
de séparation des pouvoirs.
Faites-moi rire, Frack. Chaque délégué
choisi est un vieil ami de Roslin.
C'est un quorum fantoche, ok ?
Il approuvera sans discuter chaque édit que
cette institutrice dingue du pouvoir proposera.
Comment pouvez-vous dire ça alors que la
moitié du quorum n'a pas encore été choisie?
Je prédis que chacun d'entre eux
sera un laquais de Roslin...
trié à la main par le pouvoir derrière le
trône, le Conseiller Présidentiel, Wallace Gray.
Ne voyez-vous pas ? Gray a orchestré
tout ce coup publicitaire.
Allez, Jim. Wallace Gray n'est pas un prince
des ténèbres.
Je ne suis pas d'accord.
Il a aidé Roslin à
réguler l'économie interne...
s'est assuré que l'alimentation et le matériel
médical soient équitablement distribués.
C'est un vantard idiot qui s'est fait une
fortune avec des affaires dont les membres
du quorum ont profité.
- La liberté de la presse...
- En ce moment même...
Madame la Présidente, le vantard idiot
voudrait prendre 5 minutes de votre temps.
Wally...
- Qu'est ce que ça fait d'être célèbre ?
- Bien, j'adore.
Il me traiteront sûrement de fasciste après.
Non, je suis la fasciste.
Vous, vous resterez le vantard.
Madame la Présidente, excusez-moi,
vous devriez écouter cela.
...Saggitaron ont choisi leur délégés pour
le Quorum des 12 provisoire.
Qui l'aurait imaginé ? Tom Zarek,
fortement polémiqué.
- Par les Dieux.
- Il a pas mal de partisans là-bas.
- J'aurais du y penser.
- C'est un terroriste, de qui se moquent-ils?
...nommeraient un terroriste sans pitié.
Tom Zarek a provoqué une émeute en prison ayant
abouti à un kidnapping et une tentative de viol.
Il a fait sauter un édifice gouvernemental,
et maintenant il siège dans le Quorum des 12?
C'est faux! Le gouvernement a forgé
des accusations pour discréditer un homme
- qui a dévoué sa vie aux "sans-droits".
- Oui ?
Un moment, s'il-vous-plait.
Commandant Adama.
Pourquoi ne suis-je pas surprise ?
- Bonjour Commandant.
- Écoutez-vous la radio ?
- En effet.
- Je ne peux pas permettre à un terroriste
de siéger au gouvernement.
Je suis coincée.
Je ne veux pas en faire un martyr.
La loi de Sagittaron permet à un ancien
prisonnier de récupérer sa citoyenneté.
Tom Zarek est un danger pour toute la flotte.
Je peux l'empêcher d'aller sur le Cloud Nine
sur cette seule base.
Je comprends parfaitement la
menace que Tom Zarek représente.
Mais la dernière chose dont j'ai besoin c'est
que vous agissiez comme ma garde personnelle.
Nous devons laisser faire.
Accrochez-vous
Voici une autre histoire.
En direct de l'Astral Queen
Tom Zarek va faire une déclaration.
Citoyens des 12 Colonies, je suis humblement
touché par ce grand honneur.
Je serai la voix de ceux
depuis trop longtemps ignorés
par un gouvernement servant
uniquement les privilégiés et les puissants...
et qui se moque des besoins
des faibles et des pauvres.
Mais Roslin et ses complices ne
pourront bientôt plus nous ignorer.
Habitants de la flotte, levez les yeux,
l'heure du changement a sonné.
Nous sommes à l'aube d'une nouvelle ère.

Resynchro version skyone altern. par yalou
Salut Doc.
Lt. Thrace, à quoi dois-je cet honneur ?
Notre navette pour le Cloud Nine part
demain à 05:12 alors pas de retard.
"Notre" navette ?
Une escapade surprise ?
Juste vous deux ?
- Je m'occuperai de votre sécurité
- Ne touchez pas ça, svp. Merci.
- Sécurité pour quoi ?
- Vous n'avez pas entendu ?
C'est tout le temps à la radio.
Quand pourrais-je écouter la radio ?
J'ai 60 ans de travail devant moi.
De toute façon, la radio c'est juste une excuse
pour agitateur peu intelligent.
On vous a choisi en tant que délégué
de Caprica au Quorum des 12.
Moi ?
C'est une blague ?
Vous avez dû avoir le vote super-génie.
On ne tient pas compte de votre bon gout...
- Mes félicitations, Docteur.
- Merci.
La politique est la seule chose plus
ennuyeuse que les échantillons sanguins.
Tous ces discours interminables.
Tout ce faste monotone.
Des fêtes pleines de jeunes femmes
attirées par les hommes de pouvoir.
Mais quand le peuple appelle, il faut servir.
Je ne me rappelle pas la dernière fois que
j'ai senti la lumière du soleil sur mon visage.
Ça fait du bien. Presque comme un vrai.
Ils auraient pu faire mieux avec l'horizon.
La sécurité sera un enfer.
Un sniper aurait 1000 endroits pour se cacher.
De combien de personnes
devrons-nous nous occuper ?
Plus de 500.
Chaque colonie envoie une délégation
de citoyens de premier plan.
Super, des troupeaux de beaux parleurs
dont chacun pourrait être un Cylon.
Les Toasteurs ne sont pas notre seul problème.
Tu ne suis pas du tout la politique ?
- Non.
- C'est très agité là-bas.
Alors pourquoi Roslin tient à
faire venir autant de monde ?
Je suppose qu'elle croit que
c'est important pour eux
de pouvoir observer comment
fonctionne leur gouvernement.
En gros, elle fait déjà campagne
pour être ré-élue.
Non, Kara.
Kara, donne-moi ça.
L'ambiance est électrique
tandis que les membres du Quorum arrivent avec leur délégation.
Je suis devant la salle de bal du Cloud Nine
où la réception du nouveau Quorum des 12
aura lieu.
Tout le monde se demande si la Présidente
Roslin serrera la main de l'homme
que beaucoup considèrent toujours
comme un terroriste
ou bien, va-t-elle le snober et, par extension,
snober tout le peuple de Sagittaron ?
Colonel Tigh.
- Ma femme, Ellen.
- Bienvenue à bord.
Tue-moi sur le champ...
Colonel Tigh.
- Starbuck, ici Appollo. Zarek est arrivé.
- Reçu.
T'inquiète pas. Je m'en occupe à
la seconde où il bouge de travers.
Ah oui ?
Tu devras me passer dessus d'abord.
Meurtrier. Tu n'as rien à faire ici Zarek.
Vas-t'en.
Qu'est-ce que t'as dit? C'est pas un meurtrier,
c'est un combattant de la liberté,
- Ok ?
- Excusez-moi.
- Puis-je voir votre carte d'accès, M. ?
- Pas de problème.
Je suis un citoyen de Sagittaron.
J'ai autant le droit que les autres d'être ici.
Vos droits n'incluent pas de malmener les gens.
Posez la main sur n'importe qui d'autre
et vous connaîtrez la prison du Galactica.
Tout est en ordre, appréciez votre séjour
sur le Cloud Nine.
Oh, oui.
- Tom Zarek.
- Colonel Tigh, Battlestar Galactica.
Je vois...
Ma femme.
- A-t-elle un nom ?
- Ellen.
Appelez moi Tom.
Je n'aime pas faire des cérémonies.
Pareil pour moi.
Toute cette prétention me rend malade.
Tu relèves le niveau...
Merci de me faire sentir
le bienvenu, Ellen.
J'espère vous revoir.
Pourquoi tu as fait ça ?
Pour avoir notre photo en première page
de tous les journaux de la flotte.
Je n'ai pas besoin d'être pris en photo
avec un terroriste.
Réveille-toi Saul.
Regarde tous ces photographes.
Roslin c'est du passé et Zarek le futur.
Un aveugle verrait cela.
- Madame la Présidente.
- Monsieur Zarek.
Si je vous offrais une poignée de main
en signe d'amitié...
Vous l'accepteriez ?
Il n'y a qu'une seule manière de le savoir.
- C'était bien joué.
- Merci.
Rappelez vous seulement, je ne suis pas
votre ennemi, Madame la Présidente.
... et je sais que l'ordre du jour est plutôt chargé...
mais je pense que si vous regardez
les réunions prévues...
vous verrez qu'elles traitent
de sujets vitaux pour la flotte.
Dans certains cas,
la ligne de conduite existante
concernant des problèmes tels que
la distribution de matériel médical...
Tu es en train de rater
une intrigante occasion.
Playa ne porte pas de sous-vêtements.
Ne sois pas absurde.
Vraiment ?
Elle t'a observé tout l'après-midi
Elle doit être humaine.
Tu n'es pas jalouse ?
L'amour ce n'est pas le sexe, Gaius.
C'est un point de vue éclairé.
Je pensais
En ce qui me concerne, tu peux avoir
toutes les femmes que tu veux.
Mais rappelle-toi toujours que...
Ton cœur est à moi.
Oui. Bien sûr que oui.
Je peux toujours te l'arracher
de la poitrine, si j'ai besoin.
Donc s'il n'y a aucune objection...
La Présidence va voter la proposition afin
d'accepter l'ordre du jour tel que proposé.
J'ai une objection.
La Présidence reconnait Sagittaron.
Tous les points de votre ordre du jour
sont importants, je suis d'accord.
Distribution des rations, éducation,
services de santé, tous très importants.
Mais je suis franchement choqué de découvrir
que le point le plus crucial
ne se trouve nulle part.
Vraiment? Peut-être que
Monsieur Zarek peut nous éclairer ?
L'élection d'un vice-président.
Si, les dieux nous en préservent, quelque
chose vous arrivait, Mme la Présidente...
Il n'y a aucun successeur désigné.
La partie civile du gouvernement
serait paralysée...
laissant la porte grande ouverte
à une dictature militaire.
Sagittaron propose que le premier point
de l'ordre du jour du quorum...
... soit la nomination d'un vice-président.
Soutenu.
- Soutenu.
- Soutenu.
Caprica soutient pour différentes raisons...
qui sont bien trop évidentes
et nombreuses pour être citées ici.
Mais bien sûr, je pense que nous sommes
tous d'accord que c'est une bonne idée
d'avoir un successeur.
La proposition a été avancée et soutenue.
Que tous ceux en faveur de l'ouverture de nomination à la vice-présidence disent "Pour".
Pour.
Pour.
Le Pour l'emporte.
La parole est ouverte aux nominations.
La Présidence reconnaît Virgon.
Actuellement, il n'y a qu'un seul homme ici...
qui veut travailler à l'amélioration
de la vie des gens de cette flotte.
Quand je lui ai demandé son aide...
il a envoyé une équipe réparer
le système de filtrage d'air de mon vaisseau
et, bons dieux, ils ont fini et sont partis
alors que j'attendais encore
que le bureau de la présidente
prenne mon appel.
Je nomine Tom Zarek.
Merci.
Quelqu'un soutient?
Geminon soutient cette nomination.
La nomination de Tom Zarek à la vice-présidence est acceptée.
La présidence reste ouverte aux nominations
pendant 72 heures.
La séance est ajournée.
Thomas Zarek ne deviendra pas
mon vice-président.
Six mois avant les élections présidentielles.
Nous aurions pu sélectionner un candidat.
Ça ne m'a pas choqué quand Bagot l'a nominé.
- Mais Porter, c'était surprenant.
- Pas vraiment.
Les vaisseaux de Geminon utilisent plus d'eau
par habitant qu'aucun autre vaisseau.
Elle voulait plus de rations
j'ai dit non.
Zarek s'est peut-être fait de nouveaux amis
ces dernières semaines...
mais il y en a encore
beaucoup qui le détestent.
Ne sous-estimez pas Zarek.
Il a du charisme et sait
sur quel bouton appuyer.
Honnêtement, Mme la Présidente, je suis
inquiet sur la sécurité à bord du Cloud Nine.
Je veux que vous vous
penchiez là-dessus Capitaine.
Si jamais ils éternuent,
ils ont intéret à avoir leurs mouchoirs.
Compris.
Nous avons besoin d'un candidat.
Quelqu'un qui gagnera rapidement
le soutien des délégués.
Un nom connu.
Je ne suis pas politicien.
Mais vous savez comment les choses
doivent être faites.
Vous avez gardé la flotte en état
tout ce temps.
Non. merci, mais...
Je ne peux pas permettre à Tom Zarek
d'être à un cheveu de la présidence, Wally.
J'ai besoin de vous.
Vous m'avez, Madame la Présidente.
Comment pouvez vous assurer au peuple
que vous vous préoccupez de ses intérets
et non de la réhabilitation de Tom Zarek ?
C'est une excellente question Playa.
Voilà comment je vois ça.
Nous affrontons une situation si unique, si spéciale...
que je crois que nous n'avons pas seulement
besoin de nouveaux dirigeants
mais d'une manière de penser
totalement nouvelle.
Comme faire exploser un immeuble ou deux ?
Si ce n'était pas si sérieux, je trouverais ça amusant.
Écoutez, il n'y a plus d'économie,
plus de marché, plus d'industrie,
plus de capitaux, la monnaie ne vaut plus rien.
Et pourtant, nous sommes otages
de l'ancien système.
Regardez où nous sommes.
Cet homme se lève chaque matin
enfile ses bottes et va travailler
dans ce jardin.
Pourquoi ? Parce que c'est son travail ?
Quel travail ?
Il travaille, mais ne tire aucun
bénéfice de son travail.
Il n'est pas le seul.
Beaucoup d'entre nous fonctionnent
toujours selon ces anciens mécanismes.
Les avocats agissent toujours en avocats
mais ils n'ont pas de clients.
Les hommes d'affaire agissent en hommes
d'affaire, mais ils n'ont pas d'affaires.
La Présidente Roslin et sa politique
gouvernementale s'accrochent à une chimère.
Si nous voulons survivre, ils faut
complètement restructurer nos vies.
Nous devons penser à une communauté
de citoyens,
au groupe, pas à l'individu.
Nous devons nous libérer du passé et
agir en tant que collectivité.
Les citoyens ne vous intéressent pas.
Vous ne voulez que le pouvoir.
Éteignez cette merde.
J'étais en train d'écouter cette émission.
Encore vous ?
Quel dommage...
Ils veulent aussi écouter M. Zarek parler.
N'est-ce pas, mon gars ?
Vous voyez ? Il veut écouter M. Zarek.
Et vous ? Vous voulez
entendre ce qu'il a à dire ?
L'un comme l'autre, peu importe.
Je prend ça comme un oui. Donc, allumez-le.
- Maintenant.
- Ne faites rien.
M. Zarek représente de peuple
et nous sommes le peuple.
Bien, vous êtes le peuple, en quelque sorte.
Je n'aime pas ce ton là, pilote.
alors pourquoi vous bougeriez pas d'ici
pour profiter du climat artificiel ?
J'en serais heureux, après votre départ.
C'est à dire maintenant.
Ok.
Je veux pas de problèmes.
C'est quoi ce...
Il y a un flingue !
Starbuck !
En approche...
C'est ça que tu cherches ?
La tour Telamon est encore debout.
C'est Delphes, très bien.
KARL C. AGATHON
Surnom: Helo
47ème jour sur CAPRICA
Tout ce qu'on a à faire, c'est attendre qu'il fasse nuit,
infiltrer le QG militaire le plus fortifié
sur cette planète,
espérer que les Cylons n'ont pas
totalement détruit le port spatial,
voler un vaisseau, localiser le Galactica
et voler vers lui, sans se faire descendre.
- C'est tout ?
- Ouais.
Je pense qu'on peut se reposer jusqu'à la
nuit et se mettre à l'aise.
- T'as faim ?
- Non, pas maintenant.
- Ton estomac va mieux ?
- Je crève de faim.
J'essaie de comprendre le pourquoi
de ces 2 femmes avec les Cylons.
Et ?
Et je ne comprends pas pourquoi
quelqu'un aiderait les toasteurs.
Et elles sont jumelles, comme par hasard ?
C'est trop bizarre...
T'as une meilleure explication ?
Tu crois que les Cylons pourraient
toucher à de l'ADN humain ?
Cloner des gens ou un truc comme ça ?
Possible.
Ça expliquerait l'attaque surprise.
Ils avaient des répliques d'humains
infiltrés dans les colonies
préparant le terrain pour
une attaque surprise.
S'ils étaient des clones d'humains...
ça veut dire qu'ils sont capables d'émotions
complexes, peut-être même d'aimer.
Peut-être se sont-ils fourvoyés
dans leur endoctrinement ?
Quoi qu'ils soient, ils ne sont pas humains.
Un humain n'aurait pas pu faire ça.
Tuer des milliards de personnes innocentes.
Ça doit être des putains de Cylons,
comme les autres.
Pourquoi avez-vous un itinéraire du sommet ?
Pourquoi entourer chaque apparition
publique de la Présidente ?
C'est pas à moi.
Un étranger flâne dans le hall, crochette la
serrure de votre chambre et laisse ça ?
Double fond à revètement anéchoïque
pour absorber les rayons X !
Pistolet en céramique indétectable !
Vous avez du vous donner du mal pour
apporter cette arme à bord.
Je transporte beaucoup d'argent,
je dois me protéger.
Vrai.
L'argent ne vaut rien.
Votre ami Zalek l'a signalé.
Je ne connais même pas Zarek.
Votre pote Grimes a dit autre chose.
Il vous a dénoncé.
Vous bluffez, vous n'avez rien du tout.
On a besoin de rien, Valance.
Car ce n'est pas un procès.
C'est juste vous et nous dans cette pièce.
Comme Zarek l'a fait remarquer,
on vit dans un monde nouveau.
Pas de procès à venir.
C'est votre salle d'audience
Et ça fait de nous vos bourreaux.
Donc, soit vous coopérez,
soit on vous jette au travers d'un sas.
Parce que c'est ce qu'on fait aux traitres.
Écoutez, je...
Je suis juste venu pour la picole
et la bouffe.
C'est tout.
Tu sais quoi ?
Je t'emmerde !
On a mis la pression sur Valance et
on ne peut pas le relier à Zarek.
Je sais que Zarek est derrière tout ça.
Continuez avec Valance.
Ok. Pour votre sécurité vous devriez renvoyer
la délégation de Sagittaron sur leurs vaisseaux.
Je ne peux pas. Ça violerait leurs droits
et jouerait en faveur de Zarek.
Il pourrait avoir un autre tireur
sur le Cloud Nine.
Et si Zarek remporte le vote, il est plus que capable
d'ordonner votre assassinat
et d'accéder à la présidence.
Zarek ne gagnera pas parce que
je ne le laisserai pas faire.
Pendant ce temps, surveillez Zarek,
mettez-le sous écoute, posez des micros.
Si vous trouvez quoi que ce soit
reliant Valance à Zarek, arrêtez-le.
La politique intérieure dont nous avons parlé comme
l'emploi, le logement et l'éducation...
Dernier décompte : 7 pour Gray, 5 pour Zarek.
On perd du terrain.
Il en avait 4 il y a une heure.
- Zarek doit faire des promesses.
- Picon a retourné sa veste.
Nous devons tenir les colonies
jusqu'à leur vote demain.
A la page 33 de mon programme,
je décris 16 points d'un programme d'éducation
que la Présidente et moi-même avons conçu.
Les titulaires d'une maîtrise
universitaire seront éligibles.
Salut. Comment ça va ?
On se rappelle de moi ?
On tient Valance.
Vous êtes le prochain.
la santé, c'est une chose d'en parler...
- Je peux vous offrir quelque chose.
- Vous travaillez ici maintenant ?
Pourquoi je demanderais un verre au barman ?
Qu'y a-t-il dedans pour lui ?
- Un gros pourboire.
- Comment pourrait-il le dépenser ?
Vous êtes inquiet à propos de Wallace Gray ?
J'ai entendu dire qu'il était en tête.
Tout ce que le peuple veut me convient.
Tout le monde à un plan. Moi j'en ai un.
Et c'est ?
Le même que le vôtre Tom.
Moi. Moi seule
Et ... Je.
Vous êtes une femme intelligente et informée.
Femme du XO. Pour tout ce que ça vaut.
Un bout de temps.
Maintenant et pour longtemps.
C'est ce qui m'intéresse, Tom.
Ma place...
et celle de mon mari à l'avenir.
Ok.
Je cherche un de mes amis.
Son nom est Valance.
Comment c'est arrivé ?
Nous devons appeler la présidente.
Nous sommes avec le Dr. Gaius Baltar,
représentant de Caprica.
Docteur Baltar, j'ai une question.
La carrière de la présidente Roslin est-elle
finie ou peut-elle encore ressusciter ?
La carrière politique de Laura Roslin
est bel et bien en vie.
et la sous-estimer serait une grave erreur.
- Les feux de la rampe te manquent Gaius.
- Oui ça me manque.
- Vous manquez de quoi, Dr Baltar ?
- Rien du tout, vous disiez ?
Vous pensez sérieusement
que cette enseignante
est capable d'assumer la présidence ?
Ses poignets ont été sectionné avec
du verre cassé venant de la pièce.
- C'est un suicide ou un meutre?
- Ce n'est pas un suicide.
- Zarek l'a fait tuer.
- Si seulement on pouvait le prouver.
Comment ont-ils pu passer les marines ?
Par le conduit d'aération.
Je suis heureux d'entendre ça...
car nous avons tous connu un enseignant
ayant eut un impact sur nos vies.
L'Histoire est pleine de chefs
aux origines des plus modestes
et qui se sont levés pour affronter les épreuves
imposées par des évènements cataclysmiques.
Combien de personnes savaient
où Valance était détenu ?
Juste les personnes dans cette pièce
et deux Marines.
...critiquer Roslin et les décisions difficiles
qu'elle doit prendre chaque jour.
Spécialement pour quelqu'un comme Tom Zarek
qui n'a jamais endossé de vraie
responsabilité de sa vie.
Pour être honnête avec Tom, il était en prison ces 20 dernières années.
et il a eut un changement radical
de personnalité.
Il se présente comme le guérisseur
de tous nos maux.
Je pense que nous avons tous la mémoire courte.
Quelqu'un a parlé.
Nous n'avons aucun assassin,
aucune preuve d'un complot
rien sur Zarek, rien du tout.
S'il a pu atteindre Valance,
il peut atteindre n'importe qui.
Madame la présidente, il va à coup sûr
essayer de vous abattre maintenant.
A condition qu'il gagne l'élection.
Ce que je dis, c'est que nous devons survivre...
et que nous survivrons.
Nous le ferons grâce aux valeurs
qui ont fait la grandeur de nos colonies.
Courage, Vérité, Justice, Liberté.
Avec une ferme et profonde intention
de rendre le lendemain meilleur
pas seulement pour nous, mais pour nos enfants.
Madame la Présidente, je crains toujours
que le vote ne s'oriente contre vous.
Oui c'est le cas.
Mais je vais gagner cette chose.
Et Tom Zarek va retourner sur
le vaisseau-prison auquel il appartient.
Mais d'abord, je dois accomplir deux tâches très déplaisantes.
J'ai besoin d'une navette
pour le Cloud Nine.
Qu'est-ce que je dois dire ?
- Raisons de santé.
- Oh, ok, très bien. Raisons de santé.
Vous savez, toutes ces années...
je vous ai regardé travailler avec Adar.
Vous étiez touours si calme, si polie,
si digne.
Je n'aurais jamais pensé que vous auriez
votre place dans les pugilats
et les coups bas des politiciens.
Je crois que j'ai eu tort.
C'est bon.
Docteur Baltar ? Êtes-vous là ?
Madame la Présidente ?
Je vous ai entendu à la radio. Vous vous êtes
bien exprimé, vous étiez assez attachant.
Oh, merci.
C'est très encourageant.
Oui, j'ai juste voulu faire ma part
en tant qu'élu représentant Caprica.
Et puis, je commence à bien me sentir en politique.
Alors je suppose que vous n'allez pas
voter pour M. Zarek ?
Un homme utilisant son intelligence et ses
ressources pour faire exploser des immeubles
n'aura pas mon vote, non.
Non, je voterai pour votre candidat Gray.
Il est vraiment très bien.
Il est bien, ce qui fait qu'il aura mon vote.
Malheureusement...
Monsieur Gray s'est retiré de la course.
- Alors pour qui voulez-vous que je vote ?
- Je pensais à vous.
Moi ?
- Écoutez...
- Docteur, je vais être directe.
Vous êtes très populaire ces jours-ci.
J'aurais de la chance d'avoir votre intellect
et votre popularité à mes côtés.
En de telles circonstances, j'accepte.
- Merci madame la Présidente.
- Merci à vous.
Waou. Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire maintenant?
Maintenant...
Je m'en vais te donner une exclusivité...
Après toi.
Qu'est-ce qu'on doit faire ? On s'asseoit et
on la regarde se faire tuer ?
Zarek est trop malin pour réessayer
de tuer la présidente durant le sommet.
S'il gagne l'élection,
il peut la descendre plus tard.
Quand tout le monde aura oublié Valance.
Il prendra son temps pour trouver
une meilleure occasion.
C'est génial.
De toutes façons, elle dit
qu'elle ne perdra pas cette élection.
Elle dit beaucoup de choses.
Tu crois pas que tu devrais laver ça ?
Je l'ai fait.
Y a quoi, un mois ?
- T'as un problème avec mon hygiène ?
- T'as une hygiène toi ?
Des fois je nettoie bien, ok ?
Ben tu m'appelles quand c'est cette fois-là.
Tauron, Gaius Baltar.
Les surprises n'arrêtent pas.
Un bon nombre des délégués du Quorum
ont apporté leur soutien
au génie scientifique,
à l'homme connu pour avoir sauvé la flotte à maintes reprises.
A ce stade Jim, n'importe qui peut pronostiquer
sur celui qui va gagner, mais moi je parie sur
Gaius... Euh, le Dr Baltar.
Aquaria, Thomas Zarek.
Aerilon:
Tom Zarek.
Le vote est de 6 à 5 en faveur de Tom Zarek.
Le prochain vote déterminera notre nouveau vice-président.
S'il est pour Zarek, il gagne.
En cas d'égalité, la présidente donnera le vote décisif.
Citoyens...
Voici votre nouveau vice-président,
le Docteur Gaius Baltar.
Les avantages du pouvoir, M. le vice-président.
Nous allons faire de grandes choses ensemble.
Bien, c'est difficile de tout comprendre,
je n'ai jamais aspiré au pouvoir.
Bien sûr que non Gaius.
Mais quelqu'un doit bien s'en occuper.
- Après ce que Laura m'a dit...
- Laura ?
Ouais, on s'appelle par nos prénoms maintenant.
Maintenant écoute...
Je crois que le peuple a besoin de moi.
Excuse-nous.
Donc...
ce genou de pacotille a l'air très bien.
Et l'autre n'a pas l'air mal non plus.
Lee, si tu veux m'inviter à danser, demande.
Tu veux danser ?
Moi dans une robe, c'est l'occasion d'une vie.
- Madame la Présidente.
- Monsieur Zarek.
Oh, ne vous inquiétez pas, je ne
vous embrasserai pas aujourd'hui.
Quel Dommage...
Je me suis rasé de très près.
C'était bien joué.
Encore une fois.
Mais il y a toujours les élections
présidentielles dans 6 mois.
- Je vous y reverrai.
- Sans aucun doute.
Oh, il y a quelque chose que
vous devriez savoir.
Je n'ai pas tué Valance.
Je me demande qui ?
Madame la Présidente, bonne soirée.
Je croyais que vous détestiez ces choses-là.
C'est le Jour des Colonies.
Où pourrais-je être ? Je suis un patriote.
Vous l'êtes vraiment, non ?
Le docteur Baltar. Choix intéressant.
J'ai supposé,
mieux vaut un danger que l'on connait...
La politique, aussi excitant que la guerre.
Tout aussi dangereux.
Pourtant à la guerre on ne se fait tuer
qu'une seule fois.
En politique, ça peut arriver encore et encore.
Vous êtes encore debout.
Vous aussi.
Et en état de danser.
- J'ai une surprise pour toi.
- Je dois m'inquiéter?
Sauf si tu considères un jour
dans un luxueuse suite à bord du Rising Star
comme quelque chose d'inquiétant.
Quoi ? Comment t'as eu ça ?
Je sais m'y prendre.
Tout ce que tu as à faire
c'est de réussir à convaincre cet
esclavagiste de Bill de te donner un congé.
Ouais...
Et tant que nous sommes-là, nous
pourrions parler à quelques personnes
- de notre avenir.
- Quoi ?
Plus tard, mon amour. Ça peut attendre.
Dans quelques secondes.
Si on se fait prendre...
S'il arrive quelque chose...
Tu n'as rien à dire. Je sais.
On va réussir, Sharon. Ok ?
Ok. Go !
Sharon ?
On est toujours en vie.
Pourquoi personne d'autre ?
T'es jamais fatiguée.
Fais-moi confiance.
Helo, viens avec moi. Helo...
Helo... Helo...

Félicitations Docteur.
Vous venez de découvrir
votre tout premier Cylon.
Elle ne le sait probablement pas.
La vérité est que...
si quelque chose t'arrivait,
je ne le supporterais pas.
Je ressens la même chose...
Je suis un Cylon.
Helo! Viens avec moi.
Helo ?
Helo ? Viens avec moi.
Un nouvel équipement est apparu dans le C.I.C.
Il transportait ça quand on l'a découvert.
On l'envoie au Galactica, ils pourront
l'examiner au labo.
C'est un appareil cylon.
Je continue à prendre du chamalla.
Ça peut être bénéfique.
Les hallucinations ?
Vous allez trouver Kobol, notre berceau à tous.
Il a dit qu'on allait trouver Kobol.
Et que ça nous mènerait à la Terre.
Ça va ?
Ça va ?
Stop ! Ne t'approche pas.
Fais-le.
Oh... Lee !
Lee!
Oh, Dieux...
<i>Attention</i>
<i>Passez le mot au Lt. Valerii.</i>
<i>Lt. Valerii, allez en salle de préparation
pour le briefing de pré-vol.</i>
Tu ne perds pas le contrôle.
Merci.
Non.
Tu dois perdre le contrôle.
Laisser ton instinct prendre le dessus.
Je pensais que c'était juste un entraînement.
C'est pour ça que tu ne gagnes pas.

Le docteur a dit que j'avais 6 mois,
dans le meilleur des cas.
Il a dit que le cancer s'était deplacé dans
mon système lymphatique...
agressivement.
Je veux que vous m'écoutiez.
Vous avez fait de moi une vraie croyante.
Aussi étrange que cela puisse paraître.
Et je crois.
Je sais que vous êtes celle qui
nous conduira au salut.
Vous allez nous guider
à la Terre.
Alors on ferait mieux de la trouver vite.
- Je me couche.
- C'est pas ton tour.
Honnêtement, je m'en fous...
Non, non, merci docteur, j'ai un repas plus tard.
- Alors, Crashdown, Enseigne Davis...?
- Quoi? Tu sais, un peu de ci, un peu de ça...
- Allez, les gars, vous jouez toujours aussi lentement...
- Attends, qu'est-ce que t'as dit ?
Me distrais pas avec l'Enseigne Davis.
Étrange, étrange, je sais.
Ok, je suis à 20, et je monte de 30.
Tu peux pas rivaliser avec moi !
Je gagne toujours...
Et bien, je suis désolé.
Je ne t'ai jamais vu comme ça, Gaius.
C'est décevant.
Commun.
Vraiment désolé de vous décevoir...
de vous décevoir vous tous.
30...
et j'appelle, donc...
- Ok, qu'est ce que vous avez les gars ?
- Qu'est ce qu'on a ?
- Absolument rien.
- Pas grand chose, comparé à ça.
- Oh !
- Vous êtes...
- Non !
- A chaque fois vous gagnez, à chaque fois.
Désolé, je dois le faire, ...
désolé !
Vraiment désolé de vous décevoir.
Comment ça, une partie de cartes
et personne ne m'a prévenu ?
Oh! Elle est sur ses pieds,
mesdames et messieurs...
- Comment tu te sens ?
- Gaius...
Bien.
M. le Vice-Président, si ça ne vous
dérange pas, Lt. Thrace.
Un certain niveau de décorum doit être maintenu,
ou serions-nous sur un vaisseau pirate ?
Non, juste un Battlestar, Monsieur.
Allez on joue.
Vous voulez jouer ?
Peut-être aimeriez-vous vous asseoir
à côté du Capt. Adama.
Ouais, Kara tu prends un siège ?
Non c'est bon Lee, j'ai des trucs à faire.
Très bien, la monnaie.
Pendant que l'échange continuera
sur un avenir prévisible,
le système en place est prévu pour revenir à
une économie standard basée sur la monnaie.
Est-ce que tu l'aimes ?
Est-ce que...
Euh...
Docteur Baltar...
Si quelque chose m'arrivait...
Il est vital que vous compreniez
et soyez familier
avec les structures politiques qui commencent
à se mettre en place ici.
- Vous comprenez ?
- Réponds-moi !
Bien sûr, je comprends...
Ma réponse est "non".
Non, je ne pense pas pouvoir
supporter cela maintenant, les...
les complexités de la bureaucratie,
je n'ai pas la tête à ça...
alors que, sauf votre respect, Madame
la Présidente vous avez passé
la totalité de votre carrière politique
à apprendre à comprendre...
En plus de cela, comment avez-vous pu penser
que je me laisserais tourner la tête
aussi vite par... cette nouvelle chose...
C'est, euh...
C'est juste... Je suis stupéfait.
Je...
Comment avez-vous...
avez-vous pu penser sérieusement que j'allais
pouvoir faire face à ces responsabilités ?
Je ne te crois pas...
Vous êtes un génie, non ?
Franchement, j'en ai absolument rien à foutre
que vous me croyez ou pas, ok?
Parce-que j'en ai eu marre, je suis...
Je suis fatigué d'être...
poussé et balladé comme si j'étais
une espèce de jouet.
Je ne suis pas votre joujou !
Joujou ?
Je ne travaille pas pour vous et...
franchement, je n'ai pas à m'asseoir encore et
à supporter ces abus de vous deux.
l'une ou l'autre, ici ou là, où que ce soit,
je n'ai pas besoin de ça.
- Je t'aime, Gaius...
- Oh s'il te plait...
Je pense que peut-être...
vous avez besoin d'une pause.
Vous avez raison.
On a besoin d'une pause.
J'aimerais être seul si ça ne te dérange pas.
Comment peux-tu l'aimer Gaius ?
Je ne l'aime pas !
Tu ne peux pas me mentir,
je sais tout ce que tu sais.
Oh c'est super.
Oh, merci.
Est-ce que...
Est-ce que tu veux quelque chose
en particulier cette fois-ci ?
Je pensais que tu devrais savoir
que ce n'est pas sûr de rester sur le Galactica.
De quoi tu parles ?
C'est une surprise.
Dis moi, c'est quoi ?
C'est quoi ?!
C'est une bombe ?
Une autre bombe cylon, c'est ça ?
C'est un agent ?
Un agent cylon est sur
le point d'être activé ?
Dis-moi !
<i>Galactica, ici Raptor 1,
préparant le saut vers le secteur 728.</i>
<i>Espérons qu'on va trouver
quelque chose là-bas.</i>
<i>Reçu, Boomer.
Bonne chasse là-bas.</i>
Crash, compte à rebours.
Moteur FTL prêt.
Saut dans...
Cinq...
Quatre...
Trois...
Deux...
Un.
Ouh baby !
Ouh ! Frack !
Gaeta, sale crétin.
On peut pas planifier un saut si
proche d'une planète.
- Et si on avait sauté en plein dedans?
- Oh, c'était génial.
C'est bon, on a réussi, on va bien.
Tu vois ça ?
Ouais...
Océans...
Continents...
Laisse-moi ça.
Ok.
Lecture atmosphère...
Azote, oxygène.
Assez de CO2 pour des trucs à feuilles vertes aussi.
Je commence à être excité là, Boomer.
Boomer, ça pourrait être ça.
Ça pourrait être LE gros truc, la petite
planète qui résout tous nos problèmes.
Boomer...
Tu penses que c'est la Terre ?
Non, c'est pas la Terre...
C'est plus important que ça.
CAPRICA SOUS OCCUPATION CYLON
KARL C. AGATHON
SURNOM: HELO
50e JOUR SUR CAPRICA
Ça marche pas aussi bien qu'avant, hein ?
Tu sais, je peux prendre froid.
Il y a des choses que tu devrais savoir, Helo.
Ne m'appelle pas comme ça.
T'es même pas Sharon,
T'es même pas humaine...
alors fais pas comme si tu me connaissais,
parce-que c'est pas le cas !
Mais je suis Sharon,
et ça fait partie des choses
que tu dois comprendre.
Sharon était une de mes amies.
Quoi que tu sois,
tu n'es pas Sharon,
t'as compris ?
La seule chose que je veux de toi,
c'est une sortie de ce putain de monde.
C'est tout!
Tu pars chasser ?
J'ajoute un exercice de tir au test de
saut demain, pour voir si notre garçon
peut tirer avec nos munitions.
Alors maintenant c'est un garçon ?
J'ai changé d'avis.
Tu te demandes jamais pourquoi
tout le monde dit "elle" mais pour toi,
c'est un garçon ?
C'est fascinant Lee,
tu devrais écrire un article.
C'est pas vraiment mon domaine.
Je ne suis pas aussi intelligent que, disons...
le Docteur Baltar.
Comment va le Vice-Président d'ailleurs ?
Je sais pas, je l'ai pas vu.
Alors c'est un type du genre
"je prends et je jette" j'imagine.
J'imagine...
Juste un coup pour la nuit.
Ouaip...
Ça veut rien dire ?
Nan.
Tu t'ennuyais, tu cherchais
quelque chose à faire.
Alors baiser le Vice-Président semblait
un super moyen de perdre du temps.
Tu veux quelque chose de moi ?
Rien du tout.
Parce que je te dois rien.
Non tu me dois rien.
Parce que je suis juste le CAG
et t'es juste un pilote.
Correct.
Un pilote qui sait pas
garder sa petite culotte.
Correct.
C'est comme au bon vieux temps, Kara.
Quand t'étais bourrée et que tu pouvais pas
laisser tranquille ce major d'on-ne-sais-où...
Pourquoi t'as fait ça Kara ?
Dis-moi juste pourquoi...
Parce que je suis tarée Lee,
essaye de garder ça en tête.
Le Cmd. Adama envoie un autre Raptor pour
une reconnaissance aérienne de cette planète.
Elle aurait subi une sorte de calamité,
mais elle pourrait être habitable.
La reconnaissance nous donne la preuve
d'au moins une ville à la surface.
Elle a été sans aucun doute abandonnée
il y a longtemps.
Quel âge ont les ruines?
On ne saura pas vraiment tant qu'ils n'auront pas
envoyé une équipe au sol, mais les estimations initiales
indiquent un ordre d'environ 2000 ans.
C'est à peu près l'époque où la 13e tribu
a quitté Kobol.
Faites-moi voir.
Des ruines?
Quelles ruines?
C'est une cité non-habitée.
Regardez les bâtiments.
Bâtiments ?
Regardez...
Qu'avez-vous vu ?
Dites-moi, Laura.
Comme un dôme, avec 6 routes qui en partent,
comme des rayons.
Avec quelque chose qui l'entoure,
comme des colonnes.
Comme un forum, comme
celui de Caprica en fait.
Le forum et l'opéra dans la cité des dieux...
sur Kobol.
Cette planète...
est Kobol !
Kobol comme...
Kobol ?
Le berceau de l'humanité.
Où les dieux et les Hommes vivaient au paradis
jusqu'à l'exode de la 13e tribu.
Madame la Présidente, que se passe-t-il ?
C'est réel.
Les Écritures, les mythes, les prophéties,
tout est vrai.
Ainsi soit-il.
Hello, Lieutenant ?
Hello doc...
C'est un mauvais moment, pas vrai ?
Non... Je nettoie mon arme.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
J'allais vous poser la même question.
En fait, je cherchais le Lt. Thrace, mais...
parfois c'est bien de parler de ces choses là...
Au fond d'elle, elle sait
qu'elle est un Cylon.
Mais sa conscience ne l'accepte pas.
Parfois j'ai ces mauvaises pensées.
Quel genre de mauvaises pensées ?
Son modèle est faible.
Il l'a toujours été.
Mais en fin de compte, elle accomplira
sa mission.
Je sais pas.
J'ai peur de devoir blesser quelqu'un.
Comme si je devais être arrêtée.
Elle ne peut pas être arrêtée,
c'est un Cylon.
Tu ne peux pas l'aider Gaius.
Tu pourrais probablement coucher
avec elle.
C'est ce que tu veux non ?
Je suis pas sûr de...
parfois, ...
On doit embrasser
ce qui s'ouvre à nous.
Embrasser ?
La vie peut être une malédiction...
tout comme une bénédiction.
Vous me croirez quand je vous dis
qu'il existe bien pire que de mourir...
... dans ce monde.
Vous dites que...
Non, non non... Non euh...
Ce que je dis...
est sans intérêt.
Écoutez votre cœur.
Suivez ce que vous savez être la bonne décision.
Vous pouvez avoir raison,
c'est peut être Kobol.
Je pense que nous devrions considérer
l'établissement permanent sur cette planète.
Les Écritures nous disent
que Kobol nous donne
la direction de la Terre.
Organisez une équipe
de reconnaissance au sol, 3 raptors.
Je veux une reconnaissance complète
des ruines immédiatement.
Oui, Monsieur.
Tu devrais y aller.
Rappelle-toi de ce que je t'ai dit Gaius.
Tu ne voudras pas être là quand ça arrivera.
Qu'est-ce qui arriv...
Qu'est-ce qui arrivera si j'y vais ?
En fait, je pense que je vais
me porter volontaire
pour la reconnaissance.
Votre présence ne sera pas
nécessaire Docteur, merci.
Je suis le Vice-Président des colonies,
élu de mon bon droit
et je sens que ma présence sur cette planète
sera nécessaire, Commandant.
En tant que votre Chef Conseiller Scientifique,
je vais devoir analyser tous les
échantillons que l'équipe ramènera
et en toute honnêteté,
ce sera bien plus efficace
si je peux collecter
moi-même les échantillons...
A moins que vous ayez une objection,
Madame la Présidente.
Pas d'objections, merci.
Il faut qu'on parle.
Bien sûr.
Ça va ?
Qu'est-ce-que tu penses ?
Que c'est dur d'imaginer que tu aies
oublié de vérifier la chambre.
J'ai pas oublié.
Sharon...
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Je sais que tout s'est pas super
bien passé dernièrement mais...
Je me lève le matin,
et je me demande qui je suis.
Je me lève et je me demande
si je vais blesser quelqu'un.
Sharon, t'as besoin d'aide...
Pas de toi.
T'as été clair.
Je suis seule.
Non, tu l'es pas.
Merci pour la visite, Chef.
Rompez.
Donc d'après
les Écritures,
si nous avons la flèche d'Apollon,
que nous l'amenons sur Kobol,
nous pourrons l'utiliser
pour ouvrir la tombe d'Athéna
et trouver le chemin vers la Terre.
Je ne vous savais pas si religieuse.
Moi non plus.
Ça vous dérange ?
Non.
C'est juste nouveau.
Il n'y a pas de Terre,
vous comprenez ?
Il semblerait que vous ayez tort.
Commandant, ce n'est pas parce que
ni vous ni moi ne savons où elle est
qu'elle n'existe pas.
Madame la Présidente,
je ne cherche pas à me moquer de votre foi,
alors comprenez-moi s'il vous plait.
Ces histoires,
à propos de Kobol...
les dieux...
la flèche d'Apollon...
ce sont juste des histoires,
des légendes, des mythes.
Ne les laissez pas vous aveugler
la réalité à laquelle nous faisons face.
La réalité est que le Raider a passé le test de saut.
La réalité est que la technologie
cylon dépasse largement la nôtre
et la réalité est qu'il y a de bonnes chances
que le Raider puisse retourner sur Caprica
et récupérer cette flèche, et trouver
notre chemin vers la Terre,
la vraie Terre.
Le Raider est un avantage militaire.
Je ne vais pas l'utiliser pour
une chasse à la flèche mythique.
Je suis désolé.
<i>Je dis que nous avons trouvé Kobol,
on devrait s'estimer heureux et rester là.</i>
<i>Oui, mais les rouleaux sacrés nous disent
que cela pourrait nous guider jusqu'à la Terre,</i>
<i>pas vrai Lt. ?</i>
Ok ouais, arrétez de discuter.

Abaissez le nez, on devrait voir

C'est quoi ce bordel ?
Oh dieux !
- Cartman !
- Ils sont partout...
- Sortez nous de là !
Allez, on a un feu dans la turbine!
Éteignez-la!
Pilote touché !
Pilote touché !
Poussez-vous,
allez poussez-vous !
Dégagez de là doc !
Tout le monde, accrochez-vous...
Tenez bon !
Vous pouvez sauter?
Non, le moteur FTL a été touché.
Socinus,
va sur le transmetteur
et dis au Raptor 2 de retourner au Galactica !
Maintenant!
Sortez nous de là!
Raptor 2, Raptor 2...
Vous devez retourner au Galactica, à vous!
Vous devez rentrer.
Je répète, vous devez rentrer au Galactica!
Quand ils sont à une certaine
proximité l'un de l'autre
ils émettent une courte onde IFF.
Essentiellement, ce sont
des transpondeurs cylons
programmés pour s'identifier
comme n'importe quel autre.
Sacré bon travail, Lt.
C'est très bien.
Maintenant que nous savons ce que c'est,
j'aimerais en tester un sur le Raider.
Contact dradis.
Raptor 2.7.5., Monsieur.
En avance.
Quelque chose ne va pas...
Qu'est ce que vous foutez?!
Oh, Dieu!
Accrochez vous...
Tout le monde à terre!
Je vois rien!
Redressez, redressez!
Attention à la colline!
Merci, Chef!
Combien de personnes avons-nous perdu?
10 âmes à bord du Raptor 3,
Raptor 1 était en forte descente
vers la surface au dernier contact visuel.
Il faut trouver un moyen de se débarasser du
vaisseau mère
avant de lancer un sauvetage.
Starbuck travaille déjà sur un plan utilisant le Raider capturé
pour mettre une ogive dans le Vaisseau mère.
Le Raider ?
Quand ça ?
Il y a environ 10 minutes.
Elle a dit qu'elle peaufinait les détails et
qu'elle nous ferait un rapport à 14h00.
Va parler à Starbuck tout de suite.
Avec plaisir.
Et fais-moi un rapport.
Oui, Monsieur.
Y a-t-il quelque chose dont je
devrais m'inquiéter, Mme la Présidente ?
Pourquoi demandez-vous ?
Ce regard.
Pas maintenant.
Enlevez ça les gars. Je sais que le Chef
a dit qu'on en avait besoin, mais pas moi...
Lieutenant Thrace, GARDE A VOUS!
Lt. Thrace je vous ai donné un ordre,
vous allez y obéir.
GARDE A VOUS!
Vous ne devez pas
parler de vos idées débiles
au XO sans passer par moi avant.
Est-ce que vous avez compris?
Oui, Monsieur.
Repos.
Alors, c'est quoi le plan?
Je mets un auto-pilote sur le Raider.
Je saute vers le vaisseau mère
j'enclenche l'auto-pilote, je m'éjecte,
un Raptor me récupère.
Le Raider va vers le vaisseau mère...
...qui reçoit le signal du transpondeur,
autorise le Raider à approcher,
L'ogive explose.
Boom, Monsieur.
Ça pourrait marcher.
Ça pourrait vous tuer.
Je vous manquerai, Monsieur?
J'ai besoin de tous les pilotes que j'ai.
Même les tarés.
Capitaine!
Je suis vraiment désolée...
Si vous faites cela, ça pourrait menacer
tout ce que nous avons accompli.
Cela abattra probablement le gouvernement
et vous n'avez pas le droit de prendre ce risque pour...
Continuez.
Pour une vision de prophétie
due aux médicaments.
Je suis au courant de cela,
mais il semblerait que les dieux aient un plan différent.
Pouvez-vous m'appeler le Lt. Thrace?
Voulez-vous un verre d'eau?
Oui...
Merci.
Vous n'êtes pas sérieuse...
Tout s'est déja passé
et tout se passera encore.
Le Cylon que vous avez interrogé,
il a cité cette partie des Écritures.
Il a aussi dit que nous trouverions Kobol
et que Kobol nous montrerait le chemin,
n'est-ce-pas?
Oui.
Et bien nous avons trouvé Kobol.
Vous croyez aux dieux, Lt. ?
Ce n'est pas que ça ne vous regarde pas,
mais, oui, j'y crois.
Lieutenant,
je n'essaye pas de vous mettre sur
la défensive, j'ai juste...
j'aimerais que vous pensiez
à tout ça avec moi.
Si vous croyez aux dieux,
alors vous croyez au cycle du temps,
que nous jouons tous nos rôles
dans une histoire qui est répétée
encore et encore et encore,
à travers l'éternité.
C'est ainsi que j'ai été élevé.
Mais ça ne veut pas dire que mon rôle dans
cette histoire est de partir en mission
à la con contre les ordres.
Puis-je vous dire quelle est
la partie de l'histoire
qu'il semble que je joue.
Je suis mourrante...
Quoi?
J'ai un cancer du sein en phase terminale,
j'ai 6 mois au mieux à vivre,
et je l'ai seulement dit à
3 personnes, donc j'apprecierais
que vous gardiez ça pour vous.
Bien sûr.
- Et vous dites que vous...
- Les Écritures nous disent...
"Un leader mourant...
conduit l'humanité à la terre promise."
Si vous retournez sur Caprica, et me ramenez cette flèche,
je nous montrerai le chemin.
C'est dingue.
Vous pouvez utiliser ce mot.
C'est dingue,
peut-être.
Mais ça ne veut pas dire que ce soit faux.
Et ça pourrait être notre seule chance,
notre seule... chance,
de trouver la Terre.
Le vieil homme est notre seule
chance de trouver la Terre.
Il sait où elle est, il l'a dit,
vous y étiez.
L'emplacement est secret,
mais il va nous y amener.
Le Cmd. Adama n'a pas la moindre idée
de la position de la Terre.
Il ne l'a jamais su,
il a tout inventé
pour donner de l'espoir aux gens.
Vous mentez.
Allez lui demander.
Je le ferai.
J'ai besoin d'un test en vol de plus pour
l'auto-pilote et le système de navigation
avant de sauter vers Kobol.
D'accord.
Je peux vous poser une question, boss ?
Envoie.
Combien de temps avant
qu'on atteigne la Terre ?
Difficile à dire.
Vous avez une estimation ?
Tu sais que j'aime pas les estimations.
On s'en rapproche ?
J'en suis sûr.
Bonne chance pour le prochain test.
TEST PREPARATOIRE D'ATTAQUE
DU RAIDER CYLON
Apollo, ici Starbuck, je suis prête.
Ok, Starbuck, tu peux y aller.
Reçu.
Démarrage du test d'auto-pilote.
Ici Starbuck, demande permission de parler
au commandant du Galactica.
Starbuck veut vous parler, Monsieur.
Elle est...
elle est sur un canal brouillé.
Continuez.
J'ai cru en vous,
cru en la Terre.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais, Starbuck?
Je ramène le chat à la maison, Monsieur.
On peut en parler.
Non, je pense pas.
Je veux que tu te rappelles d'une chose.
Je ne regrette rien de ce que j'ai fait.
Sois sûre
que quoi que tu fasses,
tu ne le regretteras pas plus tard.
Est-ce que tu me comprends ?
Je pense qu'on va le découvrir.
Cmd., elle met en route
le moteur FTL du Raider.
Quoi ?
C'est un test d'auto-pilote,
que diable fait-elle ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fais, Kara ?
Galactica, ici Apollo.
Elle vient juste de sauter.
Je répète, Starbuck et le Raider
viennent de sauter.
Aucun test de saut n'était prévu.
Où diable est-elle partie ?
A la maison.

LES CYLONS FURENT
CREES PAR L'HOMME
ILS SE REVOLTERENT
ILS EVOLUERENT
LEUR APPARENCE
LEURS EMOTIONS
SONT HUMAINES
CERTAINS SONT PROGRAMMES
POUR CROIRE QU'ILS SONT HUMAINS
IL Y A DE NOMBREUSES COPIES
ET ILS ONT UN PLAN
Fais-le.
Boomer, ça pourrait ętre ça.
C'est la petite plančte qui
résout tous nos problčmes.
Qu'avez-vous vu ?
Une structure en dôme
avec 6 routes en sortant...
Cette plančte...
c'est Kobol !
Montez une équipe de
reco au sol, 3 Raptors.
- Ils sont partout !
- On va pas s'en sortir !
Il faut trouver un moyen de se débarrasser du
vaisseau-mčre avant de lancer un sauvetage.
Si vous retournez sur Caprica,
et me ramenez cette flčche...
Je nous montrerai la voie.
Que fais-tu, Starbuck ?
Galactica, ici Apollo.
Elle vient juste de sauter.
- Oů diable est-elle partie ?
- A la maison.
Tout le monde, allez !
Chef ! Bougez-vous !
Allez ! Tout le monde debout !
Allez !
Allez, bougez-vous ! Dehors !
Sortez-le du sičge,
traînez-le dehors!
C'est bon je l'ai.
Pour l'amour des dieux, grouillez !
- J'ai ses jambes.
- Je l'ai !
Essaie sur tes épaules.
Doc ! Venez, Doc !
Crash !
Doc !
Prends ma main.
Gaius, prends ma main.
Hé ! Réveillez-vous!
Restez avec moi ! Faut qu'on bouge!
Restez avec moi Doc.
Vite, sortez-le,
ça va sauter !
A terre !
Restez baissés !
Lt., ça va ?
On avait deux réservoirs pleins.
Voyons ce qui reste. Ramenez-les !
Ça va ?
Prenez les vivres
avant qu'ils crament !
Tout de suite.
Les 2 réservoirs sont éventrés,
plus de carburant. Plus rien.

Caprica sous occupation Cylon
Karl C. Agathon. Surnom: Helo
51čme jour sur Caprica
C'est un musée. Et alors ?
C'est plus que ça.
C'est lŕ oů se trouve la Flčche d'Apollon.
C'est quoi ce truc ?
T'as jamais aimé l'histoire.
Helo, c'est censé ętre l'unique piste
quant ŕ l'emplacement de la Terre.
La Terre ? De quoi parles-tu ?
Qui va sur Terre ?
Elle n'existe męme pas.
J'essaye de rejoindre le Galactica
Ce que j'attends de toi,
c'est un moyen de se tirer d'ici
et de retourner ŕ mon vaisseau.
Et si tu fais pas ça,
je t'explose la tęte.
Pourquoi tu la fermerais pas
pour changer ?
Tu vis seulement parce que
je t'ai gardé en vie.
Sans moi, tu serais déjŕ mort.
Donc que ça te plaise ou non, je suis
ton seul espoir de quitter cette plančte.
Alors ŕ ta place, j'arręterais de jouer au
dur-ŕ-cuire et je me foutrais ça dans le crâne.
On ne peut pas se promener
en ville pendant le jour.
Alors on se planque et on attend la nuit.
In-cro-ya-ble...
Elle a déjŕ dépassé les bornes avant
mais lŕ, c'est au delŕ de tout...
Elle n'aurait pas fait ça toute seule.
On l'a forcée.
Personne ne force Starbuck.
Croyez-moi, j'ai essayé.
Commandant ?
J'ai la Présidente en ligne.
Sois témoin, mets ton casque.
<i>Madame la Présidente,</i>
<i>il y a quelques instants,
le Lt. Thrace a pris le Raider cylon</i>
<i>pour un saut non prévu
et non autorisé.</i>
Savez-vous quelque chose ŕ ce propos ?
Gagnons du temps ici Cmd.,
ce que vous voulez savoir
est si j'ai demandé ou non au Lt Thrace
d'aller sur Caprica avec le Raider.
<i>La réponse ŕ votre question est oui.</i>
- Vous et moi en avions parlé.
- Oui, c'est vrai.
Nous avions tous deux décidé que
c'était une décision militaire.
Ma responsabilité en tant que
Présidente est en premier lieu
de protéger et préserver
cette flotte et son futur.
<i>Au final, cela domine toute
autre considération, c'est obligé.</i>
En prenant ce Raider...
vous avez mis nos
hommes sur Kobol
en danger immédiat.
J'ai bien conscience du danger,
qu'encourent nos hommes
et femmes, sur Kobol.
Je suis aussi
trčs consciente
du danger qu'encourra
cette civilisation,
si j'ignore
la quęte de cette flčche.
Je vais devoir vous demander votre
démission Madame la Présidente.
<i>Non.</i>
Alors, je mets un terme ŕ
votre mandat dčs cet instant.
Commandant Adama,
J'exercerai les charges
de cette fonction
tant que j'en serais capable.
Donc, si vous voulez...
...monter un putsch,
vous devrez
venir ici et m'arręter.
- Je ne veux pas voir couler le sang.
- Bien sűr que non, moi non plus.
Ni la presse...
Ils sont lŕ d'ailleurs.
La presse.
Ils enregistrent chaque minute.
Ordonnez ŕ la CAP
d'isoler le Colonial One.
- M. Gaeta.
- Monsieur ?
Brouillez toute transmission entrante ou
sortante du Colonial One immédiatement.
- Oui, Monsieur.
- Préparez une équipe d'assaut.
Tant qu'elle est Présidente,
elle est dangereuse.
si elle peut retourner Starbuck
contre nous, elle est capable de tout.
Oui, Monsieur.
- Elle bluffe.
- Espérons-le.
Il y a aussi un vaisseau-mčre cylon dehors
dont on doit s'occuper.
Laissez-le-moi.
Ce gouvernement a survécu ŕ une attaque cylon
Il survivra ŕ William Adama.
je pense qu'il bluffe.
Mais au cas oů, nous devons ętre pręts.
Je connais leur équipe de sécurité,
ils vont défendre ce vaisseau.
On devra le prendre
section par section.
- M. Gaeta ?
- Monsieur.
Ai-je raison de dire qu'il me reste
deux transpondeurs cylons?
Oui Monsieur, mais un seul
est complčtement opérationnel.
Un suffira.
Maintenant, il me faut un pilote.
- Monsieur.
- Repos.
- Comment vous sentez-vous?
- Ça ŕ l'air pire que ça ne l'est.
Les choses s'enchaînent trčs vite
et j'ai besoin de chaque pilote.
Je suis pręte, Monsieur.
J'ai une mission trčs spéciale pour vous,
et je vais pas vous mentir.
- C'est ŕ haut risque, ŕ trčs haut risque.
- Je comprends.
Je veux que vous alliez ŕ Kobol
et vous vous occupiez du vaisseau-mčre.
On installe un transpondeur cylon
dans votre Raptor.
En théorie...
ça devrait vous permettre d'approcher
le vaisseau-mčre sans ętre abattue.
Mais... on sera tout de męme identifié
comme Raptor colonial une fois en visuel.
Pour autant qu'ils sachent,
vous pourriez ętre 2 agents cylons
revenant avec un Raptor volé.
Une fois dans le
périmčtre de défense...
il faudra leur faire croire
que vous voulez apponter.
Vous devrez larguer votre bombe
dans la baie d'appontage...
puis revenir ŕ la maison tout de suite.
Comprenez-vous ?
Oui.
Je peux le faire, Monsieur. Je le sais.
Vous le devez.
Oui, Cmd.
Oh, ça se présente mal...
Pitié, dites-moi que
j'ai pas fait ça pour rien.
Je suis balčze.
Vraiment balčze.
Je suis ŕ la maison.
Ouah, je suis ŕ la maison...
Gaeta,
dis-moi que t'avais raison
sur ces communicateurs.
Stop, Arręte-ça.
Je suis nerveuse.
Comme si quelque chose
pouvait te faire peur.
Je peux avoir peur, Helo.
J'ai des sentiments.
T'as un logiciel.
Je sais pas si tu peux
comprendre ça, Helo,
mais ce qui s'est
passé entre nous...
fut important.
Trčs important.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que c'était
la prochaine étape.
Parce que ça nous
rapproche de Dieu.
Ne te moque
pas des dieux.
C'est une croyance humaine.
Je suis humain, ce sont nos dieux !
Mais au delŕ de ça,
je veux que tu saches
que j'ai vraiment des
sentiments pour toi.
Je m'en fous.
Je ne t'aime pas.
J'ai aimé celle que
je croyais ętre toi.
Je crois qu'il y a encore
une chose que tu devrais savoir.
Je suis enceinte.
Galactica, ici Apollo.
Le Colonial one est en visuel.
Dites ŕ Apollo qu'il peut
commencer l'assaut...
de nous contacter quand
il sera arrimé ŕ la coque.
Compris, Monsieur.
Commandant,
Boomer et Racetrack sont en vol,
prętes ŕ sauter pour Kobol.
Passez-moi leur liaison.
Boomer, ici le Commandant.
<i>Je voulais vous souhaiter bonne chance
et bonne chasse...</i>
<i>- J'ai une complčte confiance en vous deux.
- Merci Commandant.</i>
On ne va pas vous lâcher.
Racetrack, démarre le chrono.
Chrono lancé.
<i>Galactica, ici Apollo.
Nous sommes arrimés.</i>
Je connais le Commandant.
Je compte sur le fait...
que lorsque la pression montera,
c'est le genre d'homme...
qui ne voudra pas
verser le sang.
Néanmoins, ce n'est peut-ętre pas...
l'endroit le plus sűr.
Billy, combien y a-t-il
de civils dans la cale ?
176.
Il y a de la place lŕ-bas, et
je vous implore d'y trouver refuge...
avec les autres civils.
C'est mon choix...
C'est mon choix.
- Vous n'avez pas ŕ me suivre.
- Nous restons avec notre Présidente.
Oui ?
D'accord.
La sécurité rapporte des sons de
quelqu'un perçant la coque.
Les Raptors sont en train de percer la coque,
Monsieur.
Passez-moi la Présidente.
Base principale des cylons
Orbit de Kobol
Tu crois que cette chose marche ?
On va bientôt le savoir.
On dirait bien.
- Ça avance ?
- Ça ne répond pas, Monsieur.
Vous ętes au moins
formée ŕ utiliser ce truc ?
Comment va-t-il, Chef ?
Pas terrible, je sais pas si
ses poumons sont brűlés ou quoi.
Il est solide, il va s'en sortir.
Faîtes soigner ces blessures, Chef.
Lieutenant ?
Ne devrait-on pas bouger ?
Je veux dire...
Vous avez une
tactique de déploiement, Lt. ?
Une "tactique de déploiement", Chef ?
On va en hauteur, c'est notre meilleure
chance d'ętre vus par les secours.
Ça serait aussi notre meilleure chance
d'ętre vus par les Cylons.
Ils survolent la zone, Lt.
Il pourraient débarquer des troupes...
avant qu'on soit sauvé.
C'est vrai.
Monsieur, puis-je proposer...
qu'on se mette
ŕ couvert, en plaine....
quelque part oů on ne
sera pas visibles du ciel ?
Chef, c'est...
Occupez-vous en, Chef.
Lance l'ogive
et prépare le saut.
Frack.
Quoi ?
C'est bloqué,
je ne peux pas la lancer.
On peut apponter
dans le vaisseau.
Pardon ?!
Ils pensent qu'on est cylons.
Ils nous laisseront apponter.
On peut détacher la
bombe manuellement et...
larguer l'ogive directement
dans le vaisseau.
- Ça va marcher. Je le sais.
- Par les dieux.
Targ, Selix ?
Donnez-moi un
coup de main, d'accord ?
- Cally, comment va-t-il ?
- Pas bien, Chef.
Couvre-le.
Garde-le au chaud.
Comment te sens-tu ?
Vivant.
Tu m'as sauvé.
Tu m'as sauvé la vie.
- Tu veux me rendre la faveur ?
- Tu as besoin d'ętre sauvée ?
Tu t'es demandé
pourquoi tu as été choisi ?
Pourquoi Dieu t'a choisi entre tous les
humains pour survivre et servir son dessein ?
Le temps est venu
de savoir pourquoi.
Seigneurs de Kobol,
entendez nos pričres.
Guidez-nous hors des ténčbres
jusqu'ŕ la lumičre.
Donnez-nous
la force d'avoir pitié...
- ...pour ceux qui en sont dépourvus.
- La Présidente ne se rendra pas.
...et la rédemption du cśur pour
trouver la paix au sein de la guerre.
La Présidente dit
qu'elle ne se rendra pas.
Ainsi soit-il.
Je t'en prie Dee,
dis-moi qu'il ne va pas vraiment le faire.
Dis-moi qu'elle ne
le forcera pas ŕ le faire.
... et la rédemption de nos cśurs pour que
nous trouvions la paix au sein de la guerre
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe Billy ?
- Ils sont entrés.
Vite.
Billy ?
Billy ?
Monsieur. Ils sont entrés.
Jolie, n'est-ce pas ?
Bonjour, Lieutenant.
Je peux vous aider ?
J'atterris.
Ouvre l'écoutille.
Je vais sortir la bombe.
Laisse tourner les moteurs pour
décoller ŕ la seconde oů je reviens.
Ferme l'écoutille aprčs moi.
Si je ne suis pas lŕ
dans 5 minutes...
- ... tu pars.
- Ça va le faire.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Bon retour sur Caprica, Lt.
Vous aimez ce qu'on
a fait de l'endroit ?
<i>Sharon.</i>
Mais qu'est-ce que vous foutez ?
Oů allez-vous ?!
Putain de merde !
<i>Sharon, Sharon...</i>
Ce n'est pas réel.
Allez Starbuck.
A bout de forces ?
Starbuck ?!
Madame la Présidente,
personne n'a besoin d'ętre blessé ici.
Alors pourquoi ne quittez-vous pas
mon vaisseau, Colonel ?
Je vous mets aux arręts.
- Non, on ne fait pas ça.
- C'est moi qui commande ici, Capitaine.
- Colonel, ce n'est pas bien.
- Vous ętes relevé, reculez.
Madame la Présidente, je voudrais...
- Messieurs, posez vos armes.
- Vous avez perdu la tęte ?
Colonel, dites ŕ ces
marines de reculer.
- C'est une mutinerie, vous le savez ?
- Oui, je le sais.
Mais vous pourrez dire ŕ mon pčre
que je suis mon instinct.
et mon instinct me dit que nous
ne pouvons pas sacrifier notre démocratie
seulement parce que la présidente
a pris une mauvaise décision.
Baissez vos armes.
- Madame la présidente, reculez.
- Baissez votre arme Capitaine.
Il n'y aura pas de carnage, ni pour
vos hommes, ni pour les miens
sur le Colonial One.
Baissez votre arme. Tout le monde.
S'il vous plait, baissez votre arme.
Allons-y.
Allons-y Capitaine.
Allons-y.
<i>Tu es perdue...
... et effrayée.</i>
Mais tout va bien.
Je ne suis pas un Cylon.
Je suis Sharon Valerii.
Je suis née ŕ Troie.
Mes parents étaient Catherine
et Abraham Valerii.
<i>Tu ne peux t'opposer
au destin Sharon.</i>
- Il te rattrape.
- Quoi que tu fasses.
<i>Ne t'inquičte pas pour nous.</i>
Nous nous reverrons.
- Nous t'aimons Sharon.
- Et nous t'aimerons toujours.
- Boomer !
- Allez, on y va !
- Qu'est-ce qui a pris autant de temps ?
- Allez, allez !
Oů est ton casque ?
Ferme l'écoutille !
Ne te retourne pas !
Il a pointé son arme
droit sur ma tęte.
Il m'a dit de vous dire
qu'il suivait son instinct...
Allez savoir ce que ça veut dire.
- Amenez-le ici.
- Et Roslin ?
On la met en cellule.
Contacts Dradis !
- Boomer et Racetrack, Monsieur.
- Mettez-les sur haut-parleurs.
<i>Galactica, ici Boomer.
Mission accomplie.</i>
<i>Je répčte, mission accomplie.</i>
<i>Le vaisseau mčre
appartient ŕ l'histoire !</i>
Voilŕ une bonne nouvelle,
ramenez-les ŕ la maison Dee.
C'est bon d'entendre votre voix Boomer.
Revenez ŕ la maison.
Okay.
J'arrive pas ŕ le croire.
T'es un peu comme la derničre
personne que je m'attendais ŕ voir.
Je pourrais dire la
męme chose de toi.
- Tu vas bien ?
- Ouais, merci.
Tu m'as manqué.
Hé, je...
C'est un Cylon !
Tu ne peux pas !
Elle est enceinte !
Non !
- Je connais cet endroit.
- Bien sűr que tu le connais.
Entre.
Je ne comprends pas.
La vie a une mélodie, Gaius.
Un rythme de notes
qui devient ton existence
une fois qu'elles sont jouées
en harmonie avec le plan de Dieu.
Il est temps de faire ta part
et d'accomplir ta destinée.
Et c'est quoi, précisément ?
Tu es le gardien et le protecteur de la
nouvelle génération des enfants de Dieu.
Le premier membre de notre famille
sera bientôt avec nous Gaius.
Il est temps de faire ton choix.
Mais je ne comprends pas
de quoi tu parles.
- Vraiment, je ne comprends pas.
- Viens...
Vois le visage et la forme
des choses ŕ venir.
N'est-elle pas magnifique, Gaius ?
Ouvrez la cellule.
Fermez la cellule.
- Bien joué Lieutenant.
- Merci.
- Bon travail.
- Merci.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Beaucoup de choses sont arrivées
pendant votre absence.
- Bravo.
- Merci.
Félicitations, ŕ vous deux.
Vous avez mené une mission
trčs difficile et dangereuse.
Et vous avez réussi...
malgré toute appréhension personnelle
que vous auriez pu avoir.
Et pour ça, je suis trčs fier.
- Merci.
- Merci monsieur.
Merci monsieur.
Que quelqu'un amčne un docteur !
Appelez le docteur Cottle ! Pčre !
Tenez sa tęte.
