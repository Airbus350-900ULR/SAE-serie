Ooh, sweetheart.
Haven't got enough, you didn't order.
Well, I've only
just arrived, so tough.
Well, what do I do now?
Who is it? Dunno, some bloke.
You going to Slimbo's on Friday?
What is it, drinks?
Bit of a pizza, I think.
Might do, yeah.
What's happening there, then?
Move back, if you could, thank you.
Back you go, that's it, back
you go. What's going on?
What's happening?
Buggered if I know.
It's orders from above.
But the body's still in there though, isn't
it? We can't just leave it.
Move back, they said, clear the site.
Special access, they said.
For who? Torchwood.
Who's Torchwood?
Special ops or something.
Is that hot? Er, yeah.
They're not allowed in, they could
contaminate the evidence. How come...?
Don't ask me,
there's no procedure any more.
It's a fucking disgrace.
There you go. I can taste it.
Oestrogen, definitely oestrogen.
You take the Pill, flush it away, it enters
the water cycle, feminises the fish,
goes all the way up into the sky, then
falls all the way back down on to me.
Contraceptives in the rain.
Love this planet.
Still, at least I won't get pregnant.
Never doing that again.
How's it going?
Nothing yet. It's got to connect,
I've just got to feel it.
Hurry up! I'm freezing my arse off.
I can't just flick a switch,
it's more like it grants me access.
Whatever that means.
It's like... Oh, oh, oh!
Positions. If I get punched again,
I'm punching it right back.
Just, concentrate. Suzie?
There was... What was?
I was..
Oh, my God, I was going home.
Listen to me, we've only got two minutes
so it's important that you listen,
OK? Who are you? Trust me.
You're dead. How am I dead? You were
stabbed. I'm not dead, I can see you.
We've brought you back
but we haven't got long,
I'm sorry but you've got to concentrate,
who did this to you?
What did you see? Why am I dead?
Who attacked you?
I don't want to be dead.
Sixty seconds.
You've got to think, just focus on me. What
was the last thing you saw? I didn't see...
I don't know.
Who killed you, did you see them?
I don't know.
There was...something behind me.
Police said one stab wound in the back. So
you didn't see anything? No.
What happens now?
Thirty seconds. But he didn't
see anyone. Don't waste it.
What else do I say?
What's your name?
John. John Tucker. OK, John.
Not long now. Who are you?
Captain Jack Harkness. Tell me...
what was it like when you died?
What did you see?
John.
Tell me what you saw.
Ten seconds.
Nothing. I saw nothing.
Oh, my God. There's nothing.
Shit.
I said it was stupid, telling
him he was dead. Well, you try it.
"Trust me", like that's gonna work.
Told the last corpse he was injured,
he wasted the whole two minutes
screaming for an ambulance.
Maybe there's no right way
of doing it.
What do you think?
You still up?
In here.
They said on the news, murder in the
city centre, were you there?
No, I dunno, nothing to do with me.
How come you're still up though?
Banana Boat came round.
He was saying he's got plans,
he's off again next summer.
How come you're not pissed then?
No, we had a cup of tea.
He's read this thing about diabetes.
Me and him having tea,
that's middle age, that is.
There's some Chinese in the fridge.
No, I'm knackered. You coming
to bed? I'll just finish here.
This man's found his sister.
I'll see you in a minute.
Von, can you do a search for me?
Oh, join the queue.
It's a Captain Jack Harkness.
Could you check him out? I'm busy.
There's proper channels, Gwen.
What sort of Captain? Don't know. Just
Captain. If I've got time. Thanks! If!
Sarah Pallister, 72,
murdered in her front room.
Rani Ghosh, 45,
murdered in Robintree Alley.
And now John Tucker, 19,
murdered in Llangyfelach Lane.
So far, there's absolutely nothing
linking these three victims,
apart from the way they died.
As far as we can tell,
all with the same weapon.
A blade, approximately eight
inches long, three inches deep.
The women were stabbed from the
front, but Tucker from behind.
What does that tell us about the killer?
That he's a coward.
But those people last night, the
people in the car, who were they?
What's Torchwood?
Dunno, special ops.
Yeah, but what does that mean?
Bet you ten quid they're DNA specialists,
it's all DNA these days,
like that CSI bollocks.
CSI Cardiff, I'd like to see that.
They'd be measuring
the velocity of a kebab.
Thank you(!) Break it up!
Excuse me. It's all sealed off
up there. Who did that?
Thought it was you lot.
But what's it for, what's happened?
9am, it was all sealed off, they never
said. Chemicals or something.
Hello?
Sorry, I'm just looking for someone.
Right, yeah. Clever.
Anyway, I don't know if you
saw a man come through here -
a tall man, in one of those
big sort of military coats.
OK. If you could answer?
This is official business.
You all right?
That's good.
That's a good mask sort of thing.
Look, I'm sorry if I'm
interrupting something, but...
I think we can stop this now, OK?
It's all very well playing silly
buggers, but I'm busy, all right?
Now, I'm looking for a man
in a big grey coat.
I said we can stop being silly.
Ah, there you are, I did ask when I saw Dr
Mahib cos I thought it
was him who said about
the police, but he said no,
then I said about the chemicals but he
said don't be stupid, what chemicals?
So I don't know, could be anything,
who've you got with you there then?
So much for sealing it off.
Ooh, there's a face!
Nice one. Hey, I tell you mate, you should
try plastic surgery. Not on the NHS mind!
You all right? Yeah.
Bloody hell, that is brilliant.
That's like, em, Hellraiser.
That's first class, that is. Look at
that, it's just like real teeth.
Go! Go! Go!
Registration - Charlie Foxtrot
Zero Six Foxtrot Delta Uniform.
Charlie Foxtrot Zero Six
Foxtrot Delta Uniform.
Hold on. I think Yvonne wants a word.
No sign of a Captain Jack Harkness.
Did you search outside Cardiff?
No, that never occurred to me(!)
Of course I did. I went nationwide.
There's about 15 Jacks and Johns with
that surname, none of them's a captain.
He could've made it up.
The only Captain Jack Harkness
on record was American.
That's it, he's American! Which you forgot
to tell me. So who is he?
American volunteer, Royal Air Force,
133 Squadron. Except he disappeared.
Vanished off the records.
Presumed dead. When was that?
1941. At the height of the Blitz.
On the morning of January 21 1941, Captain
Jack Harkness failed to report for duty,
never seen again, till now.
What's going on, Gwen,
you seeing ghosts?
You lot! Oi!
Torchwood!
You can't leave that there.
Police. I can see that, love, and
you're still not leaving it there.
I'm talking to you. Excuse me!
Move your bloody car...
Did you get anything
on that registration?
No such number.
What does that mean?
Doesn't exist. Double checked with Swansea,
triple-checked, there's
nothing, no such vehicle.
But Temple's been asking about
you, Gwen. Are you in trouble?
I have walked.
I have bloody walked.
They were here,
and then they were gone.
And look, there's nowhere to hide.
They just disappeared.
Temple's not just livid,
he's doing his nut.
There was a man, I'm telling you, there was
this porter, he was in a porter's uniform,
and he was killed,
or at least he was injured,
he must've been injured,
right in front of me, this man in
a mask, sort of lashed out, and...
And I've told you, all
hospital staff, present and correct.
I saw it. That's it? Gwen, sweetheart,
think about it, what sort of story is that?
You're not well. Come with me.
I'll take you home.
They were here. Come on.
Look at me! Hot pot!
Or, as the French call it, ho po.
Oh, I should've phoned.
I've got to work.
You should be off sick.
I know, but they were short
and there's a match on tonight,
so I said I'd take another shift.
I'm sorry.
Forgive me.
Go on, forgive me. Say you
forgive me, you do, don't you?
OK I got to go.
Excuse me, Gwen Cooper, CID.
I'm making some enquiries round the Bay.
I need to check some people out
on your list, if that's OK.
I don't suppose you deliver
to a Captain Jack Harkness?
I dunno.
Well, could you have a look?
Nope.
He's not a regular anyway.
J Harkness? Or just Harkness?
No.
OK. Never mind. Thanks anyway.
I don't suppose you've got a Torchwood?
Oh, aye, we do them all the time.
They're good customers.
Oh, hiya. Sorry I'm late.
Someone ordered pizza. Who's it for?
I think it's a...Mr Harkness.
Don't keep them waiting.
I can't do this, I'm sorry.
I'm rubbish. I give up!
He set me off. Well, that lasted
nought point two seconds.
She's actually carrying pizza!
Come on! She was gonna say,
"Here's your pizza," and I was going
to say, "How much?" and she says,
"Oh, whatever, twenty quid,"
and I say, "Oh, I don't have any
money." I was working on a punchline.
I'd have got there.
But it would've been good!
There's your pizza. I'd better go.
We've gone past that stage.
You must've been freezing out there.
How long were you walking around?
Three hours? You could see me?
And before we go any further, who the hell
orders pizza under the name of Torchwood?
Me. I'm sorry. I'm a twat.
That man, at the hospital,
that porter, what happened to him?
That was real, wasn't it? He was attacked.
He's dead. But there's no-one gone missing.
We took the body, changed the work rota,
planted a false witness who
saw him leaving the hospital,
giving him an alibi
for the next 48 hours,
so when his body's pulled out of
the docks next Tuesday night,
he's only been missing for three days.
He was murdered? Yes. And you
covered it up? That's my job.
And that other man, John Tucker?
Last night in the alleyway,
I saw you. And what did you see?
You revived him. No.
What did you see?
You resuscitated him.
No, what did you see?
You brought him back to life. Yeah.
Who are you?
Torchwood. What's Torchwood?
This is Torchwood.
All around you.
And what happens to me? I'm police.
Constable Gwen Cooper.
You can't do anything.
Right then, PC Cooper...
..d'you want to come see?
See what? You saw the murder.
Come and see the murderer.
Go with him.
What is Torchwood? Who are you? What is
this place? SCREECHING
What was that? Pterodactyl.
Are you coming?
It's all right -
it's safe, it's sedated.
It's called a Weevil.
Or at least, we call them Weevils.
We don't know their real name, cos they're
not too good at communicating.
But we've got a couple of hundred of them in
the city living in the sewers,
feeding off the...
Well, it's the sewers,
you can guess.
But every once in a while, one of them goes
rogue, comes to the surface, attacks.
Actually, it's been happening more
and more and we have no idea why.
But it's alien.
Look into its eyes.
There you go.
Take your time.
It was born on a different world
and it's real.
Owen Harper, Gwen Cooper.
"Doctor" Owen Harper, thank you.
Toshiko Sato, Suzie Costello,
she's second-in-command.
And this is Ianto Jones,
Ianto cleans up after us and gets us
everywhere on time. I try my best.
And he looks good in a suit.
Careful, that's harassment, sir.
Why are you telling me their names?
I'm not supposed to know, am I? This is
classified, isn't it? Way beyond classified.
Then you shouldn't be telling me.
What are you gonna do to me?
What d'you imagine? Well,
I've seen too much.
Your names and everything,
and the Weevil, and...
You can dump a man in the water
and lie about his death.
OK! Tosh, finish that calibration
tomorrow morning.
Owen, first thing, get a
hold of Chandler and Bell,
cos I think they're lying.
Ianto, if he needs back-up, then you'd
better be on stand-by. Suzie,
I know it's a pain in the ass,
but I need the costing on the glove
research, and you're coming with me.
I'm getting tired of following you.
No you're not, and you never will.
Stand on here. C'mon, next to me.
Good night!
Now, you came in
through the front door.
Let's take the scenic route.
But they can see the lift.
Why aren't they...?
We're right out in the open.
They can see everything!
Do they look like they
can see us? No, but...
Look at us! We couldn't be
any more public! Hello!
Hey, you there, hello!
It's called a perception filter. He can
sort of see us, but we don't quite register.
Just like something
in the corner of your eye.
It only works on this exact spot.
Step off... Hi! Nice night!
And lo, we are perceived.
How does it work? No idea. We know
how to use it, not how it happens.
But if I were to guess,
I'd say that there was
once a dimensionally transcendental
chameleon-circuit
placed right on this spot which welded its
perception properties to
a spatio-temporal rift.
But that sounds kind of ridiculous.
"Invisible lift" has got
more of a ring to it.
But if no-one can see it
when the lift's coming up,
there's a bloody big hole in
the floor, don't people fall in?
That is so Welsh. What is?
I show you something fantastic -
you find fault.
I just don't understand...
I tell you what I don't understand.
You're gonna rattle on with that,
"How can this be true?" What's
it gonna take for you people?
If you want evidence of aliens,
how about that great spaceship hovering
over London on Christmas Day?
What about the battle of Canary
Wharf? A Cyberman in every home!
My boyfriend says it's like
a sort of terrorism.
Like they put drugs in the water supplies -
psychotropic drugs, causing
mass hallucinations and stuff.
Yeah, well your boyfriend's stupid.
Oh, you've met him?
So...you catch aliens?
Yup. You catch aliens for a living?
Yes, we do. You're an alien-catcher?
Yes, I am. Caught any good aliens?
Tons of 'em! That's hell of a job.
Sure is.
This is so weird.
And who are you, then?
Captain Jack Harkness.
I did some research and there's only one
Captain Jack Harkness on record.
And he disappeared in 1941. Well...
that couldn't be me...could it?
We don't just catch aliens.
We scavenge the stuff
they leave behind.
Find ways of using it.
Arming the human race for the future.
The twenty-first century is when it all
changes, and you've got to be ready.
But who's in charge of you?
We're separate from the government. Outside
the police. Beyond the United Nations.
Cos if one power got hold of this stuff,
they could use it for their own
purposes. But so could you.
All alien technology stays on the base.
No-one's allowed to take anything outside.
So go on, then. How the hell
did you end up in Cardiff?
This is Torchwood Three. Torchwood One was
London, destroyed in the battle.
Torchwood Two is an office
in Glasgow, very strange man.
Torchwood three, Cardiff.
Torchwood Four's kinda gone missing,
but we'll find it one day.
So you just fancied Cardiff?
There's a rift in space and time
running right through the city.
The Weevils didn't come in a
spaceship. They just slip through.
All sorts of things
get washed up here.
Creatures, timeshifts, space junk,
debris, flotsam and jetsam.
Sounds like Cardiff, yeah.
Hey, don't knock it, I'm a citizen.
But where are you from?
All sorts of places.
Thing is, we could liaise on this...
the serial killer. I could be like
your liaison with the police.
Right, I can see the mistake.
You think because we showed up
we're out to catch the killer.
Sorry. Nothing to do with us. Then what
were you doing there? Testing the glove.
We need murder victims, simple as that. The
glove only works on the recently deceased,
and the more violent the trauma,
the stronger the resurrection.
All we need is fresh meat.
No, you were asking that man,
John Tucker, I saw you, you were
asking him about his killer.
He'd just been murdered,
what else are you gonna ask? You
could get an ID. You could help.
We're busy. And your work is more
important? Now you've got it.
Well, that's tough shit.
Cos if you let me go, then I have a
duty, cos that glove could help us.
If you remember. What d'you mean?
How's your drink?
Have you poisoned me? Don't be so
dramatic. It's an amnesia pill.
My own recipe, with a touch
of denial and a dash of retcon.
Wake up tomorrow morning, you'll have
forgotten everything about Torchwood.
Worse still,
you'll have forgotten me...
..which is kind of tragic.
Don't think you can fight it
by staying awake.
I mixed in a little
bit of sedative too.
Then I'll tell someone! D'you really
want us to come and find them too?
You bastard. Language!
Nice knowing you, Gwen Cooper.
Hello. All right?
You having a good time? I was.
Can I buy you a drink?
No, thanks, I'm fine.
Am I wasting my time?
I dunno, are you?
I've got to be up early and
I've got hell of a day
tomorrow and I can't be bothered
with all the chat.
So...do you want a drink or what?
Bloody hell fire. You're coming
home with me, you are. Right now!
Oi, you bastard, come here! Linda, what the
fuck do you think you are doing?!
I'm taking him home
and I'm having him, now piss off!
What the fuck d'you think you're
doing with my girlfriend? Hey,
she was on her own. She never said.
You fucking tosser.
Colin, button it, he's mine.
Do you want to have a go? You want to
have a go? Come on then mate! Well,
if it makes it easier...
I am so having you.
I'm having him first! Taxi!
Did you get pissed? No.
What time is it?
Seven thirty.
You said you were working
last night. I was.
Then how come
you fell asleep in here?
I haven't, I was...typing.
That is work.
I'm not having a go, I'm just saying.
Not exactly clever going out on the lash
when you've just had a bang on the head.
I hope you didn't drive in that
state. Who were you with? Diane?
Must've been. Yeah.
Have any luck? With what?
Captain Jack Harkness.
How d'you mean? Who's he? Oh,
well don't worry about me, just
go ahead, wasting my time.
Aye, aye. Come to see
where the real work's done?
Yes, sir, that's right, sir.
How's it going? Sod all.
Is that the murder weapon? Clever, mind,
they worked it all out on a computer.
Took measurements from the stab wounds,
calculated the shape of the blade and stuff,
even those prongs -
I don't know how they do it.
Nasty-looking beast, though.
D'you recognise it? No. We're trying to
trace it. Can't be that many of 'em.
Sort of ornamental. We're checking the CDE
logs with customs in case
it's been imported.
Find the knife,
we might find the killer.
Anyway, if it rings any bells,
give's a shout. Yeah. Thanks.
..I said to Geoff,
it's not demotion being put in goal,
it's vital,
but was he having any of it?
He's off and moaning, says, who
books the ground, who pays the subs?
And all the time,
he's wheezing away,
and I'm like, Geoff,
you're proving my point mate...
"You never come down, you're
in charge of transport.
" I said, "Mam, I can't
go hopping on a truck!"
All that Christmas stuff, all over again, I
was like, for God's sake, leave it...
Hello again. You were right.
You told Jack we should liaise with the
police. I was the only one who bothered.
So I was the only one
who saw the report.
They got a good likeness.
I'm arresting you for...
How do I know you? I thought you saw it.
And that can trip the amnesia,
one image, if you're clever.
He said you were good.
Anyway. It's not much good
now, I can't really...
But you're gonna put up a fight.
So I've got...
Um. Hold on. Sorry.
There. That's better.
Put it down. You had to come back.
Put down the gun.
You're the only one who can make the link.
Well, the only one in public.
Torchwood's gonna find out
by morning, but I'll be gone.
I don't know where. Far away.
What am I gonna do?
I loved this job. I really loved it.
And now I've got to run.
Oh, Christ.
How can you do any other job
after this one? Please.
Put down the gun. Cos it gets inside you.
You do this job for long
enough, and you end up thinking,
"How come we get all
the Weevils and bollocks and shit?"
Is that what alien life is? Filth?
But maybe there's better stuff
out there, brilliant stuff,
beautiful stuff. Just...
they don't come here.
This planet's so dirty,
that's all we get - the shit.
I don't know what you're talking
about. I wish I could forget.
Why did you kill those people?
For the glove. Stay where you are.
I needed the bodies.
That's how it works. Violent death.
And it was so easy. To bring them back,
I'd position myself behind the head,
so they'd never see me twice.
You killed three people.
It was the only way.
The more I use the glove, the more I
control it. I don't understand, what glove?
If I can get enough practice,
then think what that glove could do.
If I could get it work all the time,
on anything, beyond the two minutes,
if it could work permanently,
it could resurrect.
Resurrection on demand for
the whole world, isn't that good?
Isn't it though? Well, that's what I've
been working for, all day and all night.
The rest of them
go swanning about, but I'm working.
You've got to get inside this stuff.
Surrender yourself to it.
I did, with the knife, and the glove,
and that's why the perception
filter isn't gonna work on me.
Where did he come from?
What have you done?
Please don't. I can't let you go.
Please. I've got to.
I'm sorry.
Don't, don't, don't.
I've got to, I've got to,
I've got to.
Put down the gun.
Susie, it's over. Now, come with me.
I remember. I remember.
I remember.
Owen and Toshiko, you didn't tell them that
you were shot in the head and survived.
You didn't tell them either.
Followed my lead.
Keep doing that, and you
might just get through this.
But she killed you.
I can't die.
OK. But I can't.
Something happened to me a while
back. Long story. And far away.
But I was killed,
and then I was brought back
to life, and ever since then...
I can't die.
But how? I don't know.
One day, I'll find a doctor,
the right sort of doctor and maybe
he can explain it. But until then...
Nothing kills you?
Kind of freaks people out, so...
Best if you don't say anything.
It doesn't matter anyway.
You'll only wipe my memory again.
Why would I do that?
Torchwood's got a vacancy.
Job going spare. Do you want it?
But what d'you need me for?
Cos maybe you were right.
We could do more to help.
What d'you think,
d'you want to join up? Yeah.
I do. Yes.
Subtitles captured by BodoWitcha
Yes!
That is the last
time you choose a film.
I was told it was good.
I feel asleep, Rhys.
What does it mean, "Special Ops"?
It's no big deal. Mostly filing.
Special admin, really.
Can we talk about something else?
Oh, come on,
it's your first day tomorrow,
I'm excited for you! Big promotion.
Secondment. You'll be brilliant.
Let's have an early night.
Check, please!
Bloody hell! Is that plane on fire?
It's not a plane.
We haven't paid. Come on.
What was that?
MOBILE PHONE BEEPS
I've got to go to work.
Simple locating clean up operation.
Find that meteorite before
anyone else gets their hands on it.
Good to see you, by the way.
Tosh, you found it yet?
You got enough kit?
Basic tracking and surveillance.
The crash site.
With this we can tap into CCTV
networks, national databases.
This is the police computer system.
You shouldn't have this!
Might wanna stop saying "you"
and start saying "we".
Crash site is 100 metres ahead.
Shit.
The amateurs got here first.
All right. Usual formation.
What's the usual formation?
Varies.
How can a usual formation vary?
Who the hell are you?!
Sorry! This area's restricted.
No, it's all right, I'm with...
Special Ops. I'm Special Ops.
Torchwood. I'm with Torchwood.
Don't mess with me, little girl.
You're not with Torchwood.
And even if you were...
You'd have put out
the welcome banners!
First of all, she's no little girl.
All the right curves
in all the right places.
But she is Torchwood. We both are.
We'd appreciate it
if you'd leave us
to do the real work.
Shall we?
So let's see what we came for.
What do we know?
Bog standard space debris.
That's a technical term.
Yeah, thanks.
So take all the readings
and let's get out of here.
Make yourself useful, sweetheart!
Pass us the big chisel from the
toolbox. Not sweetheart - Gwen.
One syllable, sure you can manage it.
Not sweetcheeks? Freckles? New Girl?
It's a shame your tool's not
big enough for the job, darlin'.
Catch! Don't! Shit!
Put this on!
Is this all I get now,
your voicemail?
You're out with her, aren't you?
You bastard, you could've
had the decency to text.
I've been standin' in
there all on my own.
I'm sick of this hanging around
all of the time waiting for you to
show up. I wish I'd never met you.
I wish I was dead, no,
I wish you were dead.
Call me back.
Hiya. Evening, ladies.
Hiya, handsome.
Very nice.
Where do you think you're going?
I've been in once,
I came out to make a call.
There's no readmission.
Um, OK, then, on you go.
Watch and learn, boys.
I don't even know your name.
Overrated, names.
I don't think...I can...hold on.
Well, go on, then.
Go on...you're...this
is...the best... Oh!
HE MOANS
I'm so sorry.
Seriously, stop saying that.
But I am! I mean, really,
I mean really, really sorry.
God, I can't believe it.
Didn't they teach you
Health and Safety in the police?
You chucked tools
at each other, so...
We didn't miss. I'll sort it.
Whatever's happened, I'll deal with
it. What d'you think has happened?
I mean, it was just gas, wasn't it?
That can't be too bad, can it?
Right, because gas never
did anyone any harm(!)
On the plus side, we've got good
evidence, relatively undamaged.
On the downside,
there's an alien on the loose,
we don't know where it is, why
it's here or what it's going to do.
Give her a break! God, this has
been the worst first day ever.
We all make mistakes.
Now we find and recover
whatever came out of there.
This might help. Nightclub death
been phoned into 999.
Circumstances sound...
a little unusual.
Might be connected.
Torchwood.
Gwen? Hi!
Bloody hell! Look at you, all posh.
Special ops! We were wondering.
I meant to call.
It's been a bit of a whirlwind.
Go on, then, tell us all. Coming?
Yeah, sorry.
You can get away now. No point you
freezing your arse off out here.
Boss of me now, are you?
Say hi to everyone for me.
This is all that's left?
How's that possible?
The question is how did you
know this used to be a body?
Go on, son! With you all the way!
Bit of a shock, I tell you.
We need to see that CCTV.
Wow. Oh, my God!
He just... Came and went.
That's the way I'd like to go.
I'm sure we could arrange it.
How can that be?
It doesn't make any sense.
It's not possible.
Do you know the girl's name?
Did they arrive together
or meet in the club?
Is she a regular? Would any of the
other staff know her? I dunno!
We get hundreds of people
here every weekend.
I don't keep tabs.
Thanks for your help.
We've got all we need.
What are you talking about?
We haven't got a clue.
We don't even know her name!
We need a body from the
cryo-chamber, close match
for the dead guy.
Disfigure the face,
dump it someplace remote, make
it look like a suicide attempt.
You have a stash of bodies?
What about his family?
You can't just fake his death.
You want to tell his family
he died screwing an alien?
We don't know for sure.
Same elements recorded
at the crash site.
Traces all over the club
but strongest in this area.
Something happened here.
It's my fault.
If it weren't for me,
he'd still be alive.
That'll get you nowhere,
that thinking.
At least now we know a little more.
The alien's taken on a host body.
We can't let her kill again.
I said to them, you're putting
yourselves out of work,
behaving like this.
I can get five Polish lads
who don't take any breaks,
happy as sand boys,
all for 56 quid above board.
I told Niall, I said, "Why should
I bother with your moaning mates
when I can get this?"
Carys? Dad?
Hangover from hell, is it?
What did you get up to last night?
I can't really remember.
Mullered, I was.
Gotta go.
Tony needs the van by nine.
You in tonight?
What's this supposed to do?
I'm using satellite-tracking data
to determine the inward trajectory
of the meteorite.
He means he's trying to find
out where it's came from.
Sometimes techno babble
is good for the soul.
So this is a route planner.
Not far off.
Rhys, my boyfriend, is a transport
manager. He does this sort of stuff.
On a slightly smaller scale, though.
You have a boyfriend?
Yeah. Have you?
Don't have time with this job.
What about you? You seeing anyone?
You've gotta be joking.
I can get all the grief I need here.
None of you have partners?
Just you, newbie.
I'm not being rude or anything...
Well, maybe I am, but...
how do you
switch off from all this stuff?
What do you do to relax?
I torture people
in happy relationships.
SHE SOBS
Gas traces confirmed
as Vorax and Suranium.
My two favourite gases.
Can we do a check, and find
out what we know about them?
I'm all over it. What's this doing?
I've taken an image of the girl
from the CCTV. This cross-checks
her face with the UK population.
You can't have every
face in the UK on there.
That would be against
civil liberties, data protection...
Still doing that "you"
instead of "we" thing.
119 suspects.
It's supposed
to give us a single match.
The CCTV was too low res.
I've tried magnifying and
augmenting but it just breaks up.
The software can't function
properly. It's narrowed
the numbers down.
I could check through the rest. The
old fashioned way - with my eyes.
What about the fingerprints
I took off the alley wall?
It was a long-shot, anyway.
Just a bit.
Least I'm trying to do something.
You're trying anything.
The CCTV must have picked up
her arrival at the club.
Tosh, can you reformat the
image recognition software
to trace her journey backwards
via street cameras?
It'll take a while to process.
Every possible turn means
thousands of probabilities.
Have a go. At least we'll
know where she started.
We could cross reference that
with the remaining face matches.
Good one, newbie!
That's a bit more like it!
Ah!
Ah!
No!
DOORBELL RINGS
You're keeping our website
in business.
Well, your, er, dad's not in, then?
Get your clothes off!
Steady, Carys!
All right, that's enough.
Joke over. Barry's
put you up to this, has he? Shut up!
What's going on?! Put your
trousers on and get out. NOW!
It always breaks my heart to
say those words. Air quality's OK.
Gwen, look out!
What's that?
It's a sort of inflatable cell.
Power runs down after an hour.
The battery life's bollocks.
Who said you could use that? Um,
I just stopped a prisoner escaping.
You know the rules. None of
that stuff leaves the building
without my permission.
Fine. Don't thank me.
Come with us.
See what you can find out from her.
But aren't you going to help me?
I don't know what I'm doing.
Usually better if you don't say
that in front of the prisoner.
Are you MI5?
Where am I? What do you want?
I think you know, Carys.
How d'you know my name?
I've never been in trouble.
What do you want from me?
I know there's something
living inside you
and I know what it made
you do. His name was Matt Stevens.
His parents lost their only
child at 3:07 this morning.
Ah! Ah!
You broke my ship.
Come on then. Where are you from
and why are you trying to invade
earth? You can forget
about enslaving us.
Who said anything about enslaving?
Well, that's what you
lot do. Aliens. Isn't it?
No, I just want the energy.
The climax.
I live off that energy.
Right, sorry, just to recap.
You've travelled here
to feed off orgasmic energy?
There's nothing else
out there like it.
You taste so good.
You're the best hit there is.
Ah! Ah! No!
Help me
Please, get it out of me.
Carys?
Hel-lo.
Happy birthday, me.
OK, first contact with an alien.
Not quite what I expected.
Oi, you lot...treat!
Whoa. Wow.
She said she had a boyfriend.
You people and your
quaint little categories.
We should really
get her out of there.
Yeah. I mean, yeah! Come on!
Just...record a bit first.
No! It's no good.
It's got to be a man.
Ah! Oh!
I'm losing.
Promise me you'll help me.
Promise me.
MOBILE PHONE RINGS
I promise.
Hi.
You're not still at work? 'Fraid so.
'What time will you be done?'
Not sure when I'll be finished.
Is it exciting, though, have you
had loads of excitement? Erm, some.
Er sorry, yeah, is now a good time?
Em, maybe not the best.
Oh, pity me,
I'm a Special Ops widow.
I'll call you later.
'Bye.'
Way to go, newbie! That is what
I call a methodical investigation.
I can't wait to see
you take down her particulars.
What are you doing?! Get off me!
That girl's body is being
overrun by I don't know what.
And you think it's a joke?
All right! Jesus! I'm sorry.
We should be helping her.
She's not some lab rat.
No, she's a murderer.
You were the one
who wanted her caught.
How come suddenly
she's your best friend?
You know, strictly speaking,
throttling the staff is my job.
So who's for Chinese?
And she said...
"If I'd known that's what he was,
I never would have married him!"
She knew all along!
She didn't care.
Until he started leaving black piles
of mucus in the bathtub.
Always the big giveaway. Aliens
have no sense of household hygiene.
Which reminds me, gotta pee.
So what's he told you? What about?
Himself! You've been here longer
than I have. We were banking on you!
You're a copper, trained to ask
questions. You don't know anything?
Not who he is, not where he's from.
Nothing, except him being gay.
No, he's not. Really, do you think?
Owen does. I don't.
And I don't care.
Period military is not the
dress code of a straight man.
I think it suits him.
Sort of classic.
Exactly! I've watched him
in action. He'll shag
anything if it's gorgeous enough.
We know he's from America, right?
We don't know that for sure.
No US citizen by the name of Jack
Harkness born in the last 50 years.
Maybe his identity's classified.
Used to be something big in the CIA.
That's what I reckon.
He must have his reasons for
wanting to keep things secret.
Sure he has. Doesn't stop me
wanting to know what they are.
WOMAN SOBS
What's that sound?
WOMAN SOBS
What are we doing having Chinese
while a girl fights for her life?
Actually, while we've been eating,
the computers have been running
a full bio-scan on Carys,
profiling her blood, metabolism,
organs, skin, the works.
So we can see what effect
the alien's having on her.
They've also been
taking samples of the air in the
cell so we can analyse changes
in the environment around her.
Now, is that enough,
do you want more?
Cos it gets kinda boring.
You've been hidden down here
too long.
Spending so much time
with the alien stuff, you've
lost what it means to be human.
So remind us.
Tell me what it means to be
human in the 21st century.
All right.
Carys Fletcher,
born 13th November, 1987.
School reports, personnel files
from her temping agency,
swimming badges, reports of
her mother's death in a car crash.
And emails discussing the merits
of Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger.
Why have you done this?
This isn't about meteorites or gases.
We have a trapped girl
and we have to save her.
When I was with her in the cell,
Carys told me she was losing.
We have to find a way
to keep her fighting,
remind her to hold on to who she is.
Have I got something on my face?
No.
Just, it's...brilliant.
You are brilliant.
Thank you.
So we should bring in her dad.
You're kidding. We've got to find
something to connect with her.
Make her fight back. Our priority
is to contain the alien threat.
Not put civilians in a cell with it.
We should be helping her.
If we don't, who will, Jack?
Are you always this awkward?
'You should take a look at this.'
This is the normal chemical
composition of the air in that cell.
And these are the readings
from the last hour.
The alien's secreting
an ultra-powerful blend
of airborne pheromones.
Sex pheromones.
1,000 times more potent than
anything we'd normally experience.
She's a walking aphrodisiac!
I did wonder why I...
Actually, I sort of snogged her.
BOTH: We know.
Now, still wanna
put her father in the cell?
God, no! We can't let any man near...
Owen!
Jack, Carys is out of her cell.
Cheeky bitch took my swipe card!
'I'll deal with it. And tell
Owen he needs to work on those
abs a bit harder.'
I was taking some readings, you
know, keeping an eye on her, and
bang. You got away lightly.
Be thankful she was only
interested in your swipe card.
Are you all right now?
Or are you still feeling
a bit of a cock?
No exit, sorry.
Yeah?
You want a little rough and tumble?
Well, let's make it a fair fight.
You won't stop me.
Put it down! That's worthless
to anyone but me.
Down now! Or I'll shoot.
Says he will but the eyes say he
won't. I'm going. Don't stop me.
Please help me.
Need me to do any attacking, sir?
Appreciate the offer.
Just open the door.
Now give me the jar.
NO!
After all I said,
a severed hand is more important
to you than Carys' life.
You want to prove yourself?
Find her.
Get your old pals in the police to
do something useful for once.
All right, I'll give them a call.
Put out an APB -
woman possessed by gas
knobbing fellas to death.
Oi! You'd better get in here!
So I'm trying to interpret
the results of the bio-scan.
Yeah, but it's just a mess, like
there's no definitive readings.
Because everything in
her body keeps changing,
nothing stays constant.
As soon as you think
you've got something clear, the
metabolic rate, the blood pressure
all goes wild again.
She's fighting the alien
for control of her body.
So anyway, I decided to
do a comparative diagnostic.
Recreate the circumstances,
accelerate the process a little,
see what's gonna happen to Carys.
Yeah, thanks.
I infected the rat with
a combination of the Vorax and
Suranium gas traces we found at
the crash site and the nightclub.
Looks fine so far.
Once the gases start to flow round
the body, the party really starts.
The heart rate triples. The brain
swells, pressing against the skull.
Then the lungs began to shrink,
making it impossible to breathe.
The pressure increases
on all the internal organs until...
Rat jam!
That's what's gonna happen to Carys?
"I'm losing", that's what she said
to me. Right now, it's a struggle
between where Carys ends
and the alien begins.
We have to think like her.
Put ourselves in her place.
It's the only way to find her.
Except we don't know what
her controlling impulse is by now -
Carys or the alien inside. The last
thing I saw was a fight for control.
The overriding factor for the
parasite is to have sex.
It's a survival instinct - that's
bound to be the strongest drive.
All right, so you're Carys.
You're desperate for sex cos that's
what the thing inside you needs,
but you know it will kill.
Where would you go?
I'd come round and shag you.
What?! It's a joke! Can't I have
a joke with my team-mates?
Right now? No.
So what are we talking about?
Brothels? Lap dance clubs?
Anywhere there's eager men?
I know what I'd do.
What the hell are you doing here?
You look a bit wired.
I had to see you. You should've
called. Bethan might've been in.
I could kill you.
I could bloody kill you!
What the hell was that message
you left on my mobile last night?
Sounded like you were off your face.
If I wanted to,
I could kill you...now.
Look, I've told you.
I'm not leaving Bethan.
You're a lovely girl, but
it's just not gonna happen.
You were my first, see.
I never told you
cos I thought you'd laugh.
And you're crap.
All you want is to come and
you don't care what's underneath.
Go on, have a go.
Get it out of your system. Ah!
Do you love me, Eddie?
Did you ever love me? No.
You could've saved yourself.
What?
We're too late.
Tosh was right, though.
She went for the ex-boyfriend.
Lucky she's young.
Work your way through
my back catalogue, we'll be
here till the sun explodes.
Where next? And how long before
that thing destroys her body?
So what's our next move.
Stop the entire city of Cardiff
from shagging?
Put bromide in the water supply.
No, too hit and miss.
The water company got pissed off
last time we did that.
It could have used any body
in Cardiff. Why her?
I just assumed it was random.
It's mining Carys' life to get
what it needs. What else
do we know about her?
Anything you can think of?
What are you all looking at me for?
You did all the profiling!
I don't know. Sorry.
She's great under pressure.
There's gotta be something.
What did you say Carys' job was?
She's just a temp. Receptionist.
Where's she working at the moment?
I can pull her employment files up.
Conway Clinic. You're joking.
What's the problem?
It's a bloody fertility clinic.
Sperm donors.
An unlimited supply of orgasmic
energy without all the build-up.
Perfect hit.
Ah!
Carys. You're not on today, are you?
It needs more.
The energy - it's not lasting.
Sorry?
'Mr Tunstall,
room number one's ready now.'
MAN SCREAMS
What's this for? Need a diagram?
I've never used a gun.
You were in the police!
I was on the beat! I'll
make sure you don't need to use it.
I'm asking for you to get out!
Relax, I can help.
I don't think so, love, I'm gay.
What do we do if we find her?
How are we going to get it out of
her? Judging by the test results,
the gas needed a host because
prolonged exposure to our
atmosphere is poisonous to it.
But our bodies are
the perfect environment.
If we isolate it
from Carys' body...
It won't survive for long.
Sounds like we have a plan.
Force it to die.
Just like it did those poor blokes.
What about Carys?
Better start praying
we get to her in time.
Come on!
Out! Now!
Get as far away as you can!
God, how many more?
In here!
Nowhere to run.
All this sex.
All we see, all we think.
So much beauty...and so much fear.
We want it but we're
so afraid of it... Ah!
The strain on her body's too much.
Any second now, she's rat jam.
One more and I'll be strong.
Each time, it works less.
Each time, the feeling's weaker.
One more. Make me feel alive.
Make me feel human.
I can't.
I can.
Jack! I've got a surplus of alive.
I'm giving it away.
You really want to feel something?
What's he doing?
That was just the kiss. Imagine
the buzz you get from the rest.
Wasn't exactly the reaction
I anticipated. Her body
won't last much longer.
Use me.
Leave Carys. Take my body as host.
Just let her live.
Gwen... I'm stronger than she is.
I'll last longer. You might be
able to save me, I don't know.
OK. Jack!
You can't let her! Like she
said...she's responsible for this.
Come on, then. Do it. Leave her.
How long can it survive in there?
It was pretty weak. Why?
Bit worried how long that
battery'll last for.
Look... It's dying.
You travel halfway across the
universe for the greatest sex.
You still end up dying alone.
Thank you.
Still here?
Everybody else is
off doing...whatever it is
they do when they're not here.
How long have you been there?
I wanted to finish off.
Do one thing for me.
Don't let the job consume you.
You have a life. Perspective.
We need that.
Who are you, Jack?
I'm sorry? You can't die.
You tell me the 21st century
is when it all changes,
that we have to be prepared.
You do.
But how can you know?
You think knowing the answers
would make you feel better?
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
Go home, Gwen Cooper. Eat lasagne.
Kiss your boyfriend.
Be normal.
For me.
So I said, those bloody website...
I've had years of experience.
I know the journeys, I've driven
most of them, I know the best way.
Am I boring you?
Sorry.
Too grand to care
about transport routes now, are we?
Let's go to bed.
You saw the echo of a moment
amplified by alien technology.
A ghost. ..40, 45 years ago.
I saw it happen. Ah!
You need to know how to use these.
Wait!
I've see things
you wouldn't believe.
No!
Get out! Help me!

Owen. Gwen. Left into the alley,
right, 30 metres.
What can you see?
I can't get a visual...
Just a signal.
Definitely alien in origin.
Diagonal right, towards the castle.
Jack, sharp right, 20 metres.
Can you identify the target?
Still trying to get a visual...
20 seconds to contact.
15 seconds.
No heroics, we've got no idea
what we're dealing with.
Ten seconds.
Got it!
Got a visual.
Suspect's male, wearing a hoodie.
Go, Gwen!
Come on! Open it up! Open it up!
In trouble now, mate.
Damn!
You star, you did it!
I was that close...
No, you got it.
I've lost him, Tosh, I've lost him.
I swear, whatever it is...
You're holding it.
Let me check the cameras.

Hello?
Who are you?
Can you hear me?
I want to go home.
No-one knows who I am here.
I'm lost. Come back...
Come back.
ANNOUNCEMENT OVER TANNOY
I'm sorry,
that damn gate cut us off.
Gwen? Are you all right?
I've just seen a ghost.
This is the feed
from the station camera.
Gwen grabs the kid.
She's got his jacket, and
he just slips out. You OK with this?
And then?
Jack and Owen arrive.
Then, nothing. Sorry.
No. It was as real as this is.
More real. I didn't
just see that boy. I could...
I could hear what he was thinking,
I could feel it. Like I was lost.
Intense emotion can be part
of a neurological event.
Hallucinations, dementia...
I wasn't hallucinating, Owen.
And I'm not bloody senile.
You pushed this button which caused
this apparition moment? Yeah.
Jack, please don't!
THEY ALL SHOUT "NO"
As if! But that's how it felt.
Like an apparition.
A ghost. Toshiko, where do we start?
The guy you were chasing,
I've got lots of CCTV, so tracking
him down's gonna be easy.
You said there was a name on the
card around the little boy's neck?
Flanagan. Tom Erasmus Flanagan.
Unusual name, that'll help.
Run a full check. Births, marriages,
deaths, criminal record, passports.
However long it takes,
wherever he is, we'll find him.
I've found him.
Flanagan, Thomas Erasmus.
74 Brynaeron Terrace, Butetown.
He's in the phonebook.
Hi, I'm DI Cooper, this is DS Harper.
Could you spare
a few minutes, please? Yeah, OK.
Dad, visitors. It's the police.
Oh! Caught up with me at last,
have you?
I'm Gwen.
This is Owen, he's training.
It's just routine - we're looking
for eye witnesses to an incident
at the railway station last night.
We were here, weren't we, Dad?
Strictly Come Dancing finals.
Who won?
That newsreader.
She's got legs up to her armpits!
Would you like a cup of tea?
I'd love one, thanks.
Owen will give you a hand. This way.
She'll talk him to death out there.
He'll give as good as he gets.
She was right, though.
We were in all last night,
we wouldn't have seen anything.
Just for the record,
you are Tom Erasmus Flanagan?
My father was an Erasmus,
his father before him.
Now, that's not
a Welsh accent, is it? No.
Lived here 66 years,
and still sound like a barrow boy.
I was evacuated during the war -
1941.
The Germans bombing
the hell out of the East End.
Cardiff was being bombed
as well as London, wasn't it?
We were taken to the countryside.
My mother packed me a suitcase...
Big sister wrote my name on a card.
They put me
on a train at Paddington.
Kept saying I had to go, had to be
a good boy, telling me not to cry,
and the pair of
them were crying their eyes out!
That was the last I saw of them,
though I didn't know
that then, of course.
Waving goodbye.
How old were you? Eight. You must
have been very, very frightened.
I didn't know a soul here.
And there was a mix-up.
I kept my head down so much
they forgot all about me.
So they left me all on my own.
Felt like the end of the world.
I wandered down this tunnel,
totally lost.
Forgotten.
Looking for someone,
anyone, who'd look after me.
"Why don't they
come for me?" I kept thinking.
No-one knows me. I'm lost.
They worked it out in the end,
they came back for me,
and I got taken in by a lovely
couple, no kids of their own.
And well, at the end of the war,
I had no-one left in London.
So I stayed here.
I'm still here now.
Just!
I don't get it.
He WAS the boy at the station.
I can't comment -
I was stuck in the kitchen
with Motormouth, thanks to you.
So was what I saw just a bit of him
from years before? Hanging around?
PHONE RINGS
Hi. Gwen, I'm just putting a wash
on, you got any whites need doing?
I don't know.
Just leave it, I'll sort it out.
No, no, no it's no trouble.
Just remind me, which drawer do the
tablets go in? Ah, just leave it.
OK, so, are you in or out tonight?
I don't know.
Again?! Sorry? All I'm asking
is you in or out tonight?
I don't know. I can live
with all the Secret Squirrel stuff,
but if you can't even tell
me if you're coming home!
Well, nagging isn't helping.
Right. Well, that's me told.
Aw, Rhys... I'm not staying in
on the off chance.
Daf's having mates round.
I'll stay there. Do what you want.
CAR HORN BEEPS
Hello?
All right!
ENGINE REVS
Our friend
with the alien machine in his pocket
is one Sean Harris
aka Bernie.
And what he's doing with an
alien machine is anyone's guess.
19. String of convictions - burglary,
shoplifting, credit cards...
Do warn me if he's dropping in(!)
The theft conviction -
he was stealing tyres off a car
when the owner turns up, gives
him so much grief, he apologises.
starts putting them back on again.
Which is when the police show up!
And here - shoplifting conviction.
Bottle of vodka and three Pot
Noodles. A criminal mastermind(!)
Got anywhere with that
mystery object? Alien, of course...
Gorgeous nanotechnology,
makes NASA look like Toys 'R' US.
Well, you've really narrowed
things down, haven't you?
At the station it was doing this.
When I held it,
it lit up and went mad.
It's not doing it now, is it? No.
So. What next?
This kid, Bernie,
where does he live? Splott.
Splott?
I believe estate agents
pronounce it "Sploe".
Hi, I'm looking for Bernie,
is he in? Friend of his, are you?
Yes, I'm from...
I'm his mother. He's a
robbing little bastard
who won't set foot in here
till he pays me the £50 he owes me!
He's barred.
He said he'd get me a iPod and
he never. And he smoked my fags.
Wouldn't piss on him
if he was on fire.
Bernie Harris, the
Scarlet Pimpernel of Splott.
Tell me about it,
give me aliens any day.
Any luck? Nope, but I got
four pasties for a pound - anyone?
If I wanted days like this
I'd've stayed in the police.
We did try, Jack.
What's he gonna tell us? "Got it
off an alien down the market."
Where are we going?
To the station.
Controlled experiment.
We replicate the original
events as far as possible.
Observe and analyse the results.
What I have to do that again?!
Someone does - any volunteers? Whoa!
We don't know what
it is, what it does. Nope.
Jack, this could be dangerous. Yep.
Don't mean to be picky, but I think
I can spot some flaws in this...
I'm sorry, I thought you gave up
looking for a 19-year-old kid
this morning(!)
I figured maybe you were after
something more exciting.
A bit of a challenge.
This door-to-door stuff
never gets us anywhere.
BEEPING
Guys, come here! Owen!
Owen!
Wait...!
THUNDER RUMBLES
RAIN
WOMAN WEEPS
He's a rotten bastard!
My mam was right,
his eyes are too close together!
I said, "Just a dance,"
but he wasn't having a bar of it.
I shouldn't have gone outside with
him, I should have known better!
What's your name?
MAN CALLS MENACINGLY: Lizzie!
Lizzie Lewis...
You're a bad one, Ed Morgan!
The girls said not to go
with you, and they were right.
Am I bad?
Am I a bad boy?
You're a big girl now, Lizzie.
You can make your own decisions.
That's why I like you.
You're not like the others.
You don't follow the herd.
You're smart.
Don't you like it that someone
can see how smart you are?
Hmm?
I can see you, Lizzie.
The way you really are.
SHE SCREAMS
I don't want to hurt you, I don't...
I-I told my mam I'd be home by 9!
Shhhh...
PLEASE!
Oh, God, someone help me!
Help me!
Help me...!
Owen? Are you all right?
She...she was so scared!
I-I-I couldn't...
I couldn't move!
I couldn't help her!
The first time, it happens to Gwen.
A boy, at the railway station.
Who's now in his 70s, alive and
well, and living in Butetown.
The second time it happens to Owen.
Like me, you didn't just see it,
you felt emotions that weren't yours.
She was terrified.
The victim's name was Lizzie.
It was maybe 40, 45 years ago.
Toshiko, do we know anything
about her yet?
Elizabeth Lewis. Lizzie. Only child
of Mabel Ann Lewis of Hafod Street.
Died March 29th, 1963.
Raped and murdered on
Penfro Street, under the bridge.
17 years old. He killed her.
No-one was brought to trial. She
told her Mum she'd be home by nine.
So what about Ed Morgan?
That's what she called him.
"You're a bad one, Ed Morgan"
Look him up.
It's kind of a common name.
What's the connection? Where did they
come from? It's like being haunted.
Quantum transducer!
Look.
Wow. I'd kill to get one of those.
Transducers convert energy
from one form into another.
They're in headphones. They convert
electrical signals into sound.
They're in this device too
converting quantum energy
and amplifying it.
Into ghosts? Of course. It's emotion.
Human emotion is energy.
You can't always see it, or hear it,
but you can feel it.
Ever had deja vu?
Felt someone "walk over your grave?"
Ever felt someone
behind you in an empty room?
Well. There was.
There always is. A ghost.
What else have we got on
Lizzie Lewis, what else have we got?
Um. 1963 - the records
aren't always that detailed.
What about newspapers? Witness
statements, coroners' reports. Owen!
What do you want me to find?
To re-open the case you need
new evidence, or a new witness.
I saw it happen.
You didn't! You weren't there.
You saw the echo of a moment,
amplified by alien technology.
So just tell me
how that will play in court?
Since when did we care about court?
Tomorrow we look for Bernie
Harris and find out what he
knows about this ghost machine.
We do our job and find
where this thing came from.
Now, go home.
Gwen! With me!
Jack?
Whoa.
You need to know how to use these.
Though I hope you never have to.
So, do I...
SHE LAUGHS
I'm sorry, it's just...I don't
even kill spiders in the bath.
Nor do I, not with a gun.
It's all yours.
Target's that way.
Right.
Let's leave the roof
in one piece, shall we?
One hand, not two.
Turn sideways to the target.
Looking along your
shoulder, down your arm,
a straight line to the sights.
Bring up the gun.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Too fast.
It's all in the breathing.
Hold it firmly, don't grip it.
Breathe in. Focus.
Breathe out.
Squeeze gently.
(Wow.)
That was a joint effort.
Try it again.
This time on your own,
and remember, breathe in.
Don't grip it too tight.
Hold it and cock it back.
I didn't cock it right.
Nice and slow.
Up a little. Yeah.
Breathe first, then go.
You know how to do it.
Two hands or one? One.
Woo-hoo! Wow!
Nice work!
Like I said,
I hope you never have to use 'em.
Yeah.
Oh, God, look at the time.
When do you get to go home? You
seem to live here. You don't, do you?
Gotta be ready, the 21st
century's when it all changes.
And I hate to commute.
Where do you sleep?
I don't.
Doesn't it get lonely, at night?
I'd better get back,
Rhys'll be wondering where I am.
Goodnight. Goodnight.
Hello?
DOOR SLAMS
'Hi, it's me here, I'm at Daf's
'playing poker, and I'm winning!
Ha-hey!
'Look, just so you know, erm,
'I-I-I put your whites on earlier,
even though you were bloody grumpy.
'They're still in the machine
so you'll need to hang them up.
'I've out the bins out,
but I didn't do the washing-up.
'But there's not much of that
so...and you haven't done it
for weeks anyway. Ha-ha!
'I'll see you when I see ya. Ta-ra.'
ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS
THUNDER RUMBLES
SINISTER CALLING: Li-zzie!
WOMAN CRIES
Lizzie Lewis... You're a bad one,
Ed Morgan. Are you the-ere?
The girls said not to go with you
and they were right! Am I that bad?
Li-zzie...
Am I a bad boy?
WOMAN CRYING
Lizzie Lewis... Help me!
Help me!
So, I've got to stay out
of trouble now, have I?
Best behaviour.
I'm a fully-trained police officer,
I'll have you on the floor
and handcuffed like that.
Mm-mm! Promises, promises!
I'm so proud of you.
CAR HORN BEEPS
Rhys!
The taxi's here, we're gonna
be late! I haven't worn these
since the Luckley's interview.
I'll wear jeans with a shirt and
tie. It's mum's 60th. She wanted us
smart, that's the whole point.
I bust my zip!
I'll be flashing my family
allowance if I'm not careful.
What are you doing? Come on.
You're joking.
I'll staple it! You're not coming
near my valuables with that.
Hiya.
Daf and Karen had a barney.
She's making him sleep in the
spare room. I didn't fancy the sofa.
Look, I don't mind
you working all the hours.
I really don't. As long as you still
want to come home at the end of it.
I do. I'm here.
And you're gorgeous.
Bet you haven't hung the washing up.
Let's leave it
till tomorrow, eh? Aye.
Who is it? Mr Morgan?
What do you want?
Well? Mr Morgan.
I need to come in. Who said there
was gas? I can't smell anything.
There's nothing wrong. I'd have
noticed. Can you smell anything?
Was it next door? Can we go
into the living room, Mr Morgan?
There's nothing in here.
No gas fire, I mean -
I haven't got one.
There's an electric heater.
I don't hardly use it.
What are you looking for?
Sit down, Mr Morgan.
Was it next door?
She can't mind her own business.
Something wrong with her.
She makes stuff up. Is it her?
You won't find anything, if it is.
It's all in her head, know
what I mean? What's your name?
How long
have you lived here, Mr Morgan?
Years. This was my mam's house.
You'd remember your neighbours.
People who lived in this street
a while ago?
People who lived...just round
the corner?
Like in Hafod Street?
Like...
Mabel Lewis? She only passed away
a few years ago, did you know?
Of course, she'd moved away
long before that.
Couldn't bear the memories.
Her daughter. Her only child.
Died in '63.
HEARTBEAT
Lizzie.
Little Lizzie Lewis.
She loved dancing. Do you remember?
You should.
Pretty girl. Blonde hair, blue eyes.
Used to wear a little pink coat.
Bet she saved all her pennies
to get that.
All the rage.
She was wearing it
last time you saw her.
Last time anyone saw her.
Alive.
Remember now?
(I know what happened
under the bridge that night.)
(Just the two of you. In the dark.)
(Water dripping from the roof
into the canal.)
(Lizzie's hair all wet
from the rain, cold and crying.)
I know what you did, Ed Morgan.
And here you are, just...living
your life...free as a bird.
Lizzie told her mother
she'd be home at nine.
"Please don't," she said. "Please."
PLEASE!
"You're a bad one, Ed Morgan."
"The girls said not to go with you,
"and they were right."
Get out! Get out! GET OUT!
You thought you'd got away with it!
You'll get nothing from me! I told
you before, you'll get nothing!
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house!
Bernie Harris!
Oi!
You mind out! Sorry!
Sorry!
Go on! Kick his head in!
Mam, there's a man in the garden!
There's TWO men in the garden!
Bernie Harris! Who?
That wasn't a question.
Don't hurt me please, I got asthma.
I'm not going to hurt ya.
I'm going to bloody kill ya.
Why do they call you "Bernie"?
I burned my neighbour's shed down
when I was 12. Why?
I was having a fag.
Got a bit carried away.
Well, this IS cosy.
I hope he bought you flowers.
If this is about the dodgy fags,
I don't know what happened to 'em.
Well.
It's worth knowing, we're probably
the only people you can tell.
Me and a mate was using this
lock up, down on Moira Street.
Used to belong to this old guy.
Soft in the head, he was.
Still loads of his stuff
in there but we chucked most of it.
There was this old biscuit
tin full of foreign coins,
weird bits of rock, and that.
Thought it might be worth something.
Take it down the Antiques Roadshow.
Yeah(!) You don't know.
Cash In The Attic, all that.
So I takes the tin home with me
and that thing switched itself on.
It makes you see things.
Real things. Real people.
I was down the Old Wharf,
in the bay.
I seen this woman, with a bundle,
something wrapped up.
It was night time. She was putting
it into the water all secret like.
It was weird cos it was
like I was her, somehow.
She was scared, because she knew
what she was doing was wrong.
I knew, without seeing.
It was her baby, wrapped up.
Dead. She hadn't told anyone.
Then she just ran away.
And I realised, I KNEW her.
She's old now, but she lives up
by the Catholic Church in Splott.
So I goes up to see her.
Told her what I'd seen.
She give me money not to tell
anyone. You blackmailed her?
She offered.
I've seen things
you wouldn't believe.
There's the old bridge,
on Penfro Street.
I saw a man...and a girl,
from ages ago.
He was following her back from
a dance, along the canal... Yeah.
I know, I saw it.
He doesn't know anything, does he?
It's been fascinating meeting you.
Where you going? That's mine!
You can't walk off.
I've got rights. So you don't
want the other half, then?
The other half.
Weird bits of rock. Foreign money.
Alien rock.
Alien money. Driftwood,
washing in through the rift.
So, Bernie. Was this thing
in two halves when you found it?
I've got it...
Like clicking Lego together.
You split this into two pieces,
didn't you? C'mon, you lot.
We'll take these too, if you
don't mind. Come on, you lot!
Aren't you gonna arrest me? We're
not the police. But I stole it.
I know.
And you're going to rob it
back off me. So call the cops.
Don't go!
I only used it once...
..That half.
Anyway I couldn't use it again.
Why not? I'm going to die.
I've seen it happen,
out there on the road.
I'm just lying there,
bleeding, and then I die.
Just like I am now, not old.
What do you mean?
Come on, Gwen!
I'm gonna be 20 in July.
Do I die before then? GWEN!
Just wait there, I'm coming back.
Jack!
Jack!
Jack, I need to speak to you.
Gwen, no-oh-oh-oh!
Hello?
Help me, please...
I was too late, I couldn't stop it.
Stop what? He's dead.
Owen had the knife.
He wanted to kill him.
Owen? Oh God, I couldn't stop it!
Help me!
Christ, Gwen,
what were you thinking?
I didn't see him.
I didn't see anyone but me.
I just said his name. Owen.
Bernie said he saw himself,
dead in that street.
You saw Owen with the knife.
But I was holding it.
My hands were covered in blood.
That was one future,
one of many possible futures.
Whatever you saw, what Bernie saw,
might not happen.
Might not?!
Can't we find out?
You've got all this stuff,
alien stuff - isn't there anything
that can help? I'm sorry.
I wish we'd never found it.
Poor Bernie. Seeing himself dead.
He might not be.
Possible futures.
He might like to know that. You're
certainly finding it a comfort(!)
I don't know what to do.
I found your Ed Morgan earlier -
did a trace.
I found him too. Phone book.
Took all night.
But I found him.
Paid him a visit this morning,
put the fear of God into him.
What did you find?
His medical records.
He's claustrophobic, paranoid,
depressive, got a couple of
recorded attempts of suicide.
He's barely left his house in years.
Look Owen, if Jack finds out...
Well, he won't, will he?
PHONE RINGS
Hello?
I think he thought I wanted money.
He kept saying, "You'll get
nothing from me." Paranoia. Yeah...
He said, "You'll get
nothing from me. Leave me alone.
"I've told you before."
Told who?
'Look, I've seen things
you wouldn't believe.
'There's the old bridge,
down on Penfro Street.
'There was a man...and a girl,
from ages ago.
'He was following her
back from a dance along the canal.'
KNOCKING
Bernie, it's Gwen.
Can I come in?
Thanks.
I know it sounds mad,
but just because you saw yourself...
Dead, yeah.
Doesn't mean it's gonna happen.
But you don't know how to stop it.
For you, or for me.
It's got
right into my head, this thing.
Some things
you're better off not knowing.
PHONE RINGS
Jack?
Ed Morgan. Owen went freelance
earlier and paid him a visit.
Wanted to frighten him.
Sounds like he succeeded.
I think Bernie Harris got
there first. Tried to blackmail him.
Bernie was blackmailing him?!
Looks that way. Ed thought
Owen was part of the same outfit.
Are you home yet?
No. I'm at Bernie's place.
We're heading over, stay
right there. Owen, with me!
Tosh, keep an eye on CCTV,
in case Bernie makes a run for it.
So you saw Ed Morgan assaulting
that girl and thought you'd make
some money out of it.
"Diagnosed with severe depression.
Agoraphobic."
No. I don't believe this!
PHONE RINGS
'Jack, I'm on CCTV...and I'm looking
at Ed Morgan.' What? Where is he?
Coming onto Evelyn Street.
That's Bernie's street!
He's heading for Bernie's flat.
What, are we expecting someone?
Where are you going? Bernie, Bernie!
PHONE RINGS
Jack,
yeah, what the hell is going on?
We're on our way, are you OK?
Yeah, I would be, if someone
would just...just tell me...
I'm gonna die. I've seen it happen,
out there on the road.
Bernie said he saw himself dead
in that road?
Gwen?! Gwen!
I knew you'd find me in the end.
I knew you'd come for me.
I've been waiting for years.
Have you come for me, too?
I used to see it in people's
faces when they looked at me.
They knew!
I tried to hide, but...
they knew.
I haven't been outside for so long.
Edwin... Little bitch.
You're all the same!
You'll blame me, make me the bad
one! Edwin, put the knife down.
I've wasted my life for you.
We won't tell anyone,
no-one else will know.
Stay calm. I won't say a word. You'll
never see me again. I promise.
I know.
That's why I came.
It's what you want, isn't it?
Got him!
Got the knife. Are we OK?...
ARE WE OK?! Yeah, yeah, we're OK.
(I've got the knife.)
I've got the knife, Edwin.
You were so close.
You were going for her, weren't
you? Just like with Lizzie.
I've got the knife, Edwin.
You were so close.
As close as I am now.
Owen had the knife.
He wanted to kill him.
Why should you get away with it?
Owen. You said you were sorry,
that you didn't want to hurt her,
but you didn't stop.
Owen! What if I didn't stop?
Would I be sorry? Owen, NO!
I don't know.
Go and deal with Bernie!
No-one died. You stopped it from
happening. You got here in time!
I knew you'd come for me. Oh!
He's arresting!
Help me.
I was too close, I couldn't stop it!
Oh, God!
(Oh, God!)
I just - I just...
I couldn't stop it.
He wanted to die.
He would have found
a way, no matter what.
I screwed up, I know I did.
But um...
I didn't kill him.
I could of, but I didn't.
No. I did.
Tosh is right.
It could have been anyone.
What about that? The problem
with seeing the future is you
can't just sit and look at it.
Got to try and change things.
Make it happen differently.
It's not meant for us.
All these ghosts.
We'd be lost.
Sun's nearly up.
Ianto. Secure archives?
Come on.
I killed him.
I've still got blood on my hands.
He killed himself.
Come on, Gwen.
Look - the sun's coming up.
A new day.
The city'll be awake soon.
All those people.
All that energy.
All those ghosts.
We're surrounded by 'em.
We can't see 'em,
we can't touch 'em...
..but they're there, all right.
A million shadows of human emotion.
(We've just got to learn
to live with them.)
What's happening?
Internal power drain.
Who the hell is it? It's wrong. It's
beyond wrong. It shouldn't be here.
We have found parts
of a Cyber conversion unit
fully powered up and working.
(I'm deadly serious!)
Oh, God, there she is!
She's still alive!
You execute her.

Yeah, usual time. See you then.
Good to see you again, sir. Are
they looking after you at the hotel?
Konnichiwa, Tanizaki-san.
Konnichiwa.
I did all I could.
I really did.
My God!
It's not possible!
One of them survived!
This is Lisa.
Is she awake? It's just
a reaction to the medication.
She's the only one left.
Across the whole world.
Thank you, thank you so much.
Bringing me here. I never thought...
to get my chance...
..to study...
to work with...
anything like this. Anyone!
Tell me, what happened?
She worked for Torchwood London.
It was
the end of the Canary Wharf battle.
The Cybermen needed soldiers fast.
They started upgrading whole bodies
instead of transplanting brains
using Earth technology.
Lisa was halfway through the process
when the machinery shut down.
You found her?
Help!
Help me, please!
Somebody!
I pulled her out.
Do you know the percentages?
The what?
Some elements have been augmented.
Some are still human.
Sensory capacity, for instance.
Her breathing and hearing
appears completely cybernetic.
And yet...there's also bare flesh.
Amazing. Perhaps 55% augmentation
with 45% awaiting completion.
Do you think?
Or perhaps, maybe 60/40.
It's fascinating.
Can you make her human again?
You took parts from a Cyber
conversion unit and modified them
into a life support for her?
How did you know what to do?
I told him.
I thought you were resting.
You should be resting.
How's the pain?
Are the new doses working?
A little.
Oh... Is this him?
I promised, didn't I?
And you always keep your promises.
I would like to ask her
some questions.
My name is Dr Tanizaki.
I specialise in Cybernetics.
Your friend, Mr Jones, asked me...
My boyfriend.
Yes. He asked me to come.
We agreed, together.
Few simple questions.
What is your name? Lisa Hallett.
How old are you? 26.
What is the last thing you remember
before coming here?
Somebody! Anybody!
Pain.
I remember my body burning with pain.
You said...
there was somewhere I
could work upstairs?
This first stage should enable her
to breathe without the respirator.
Once her body functions
without support,
I can judge what work is needed.
What if she's not ready
to breathe on her own?
You must be prepared for her
not to survive.
Sometimes...
in order to save what we love,
we have to risk losing it.

There'll be an emergency,
we're all raring to go, I jump in,
what do I find?
Seat's in the wrong position, the
rear view mirror's out of line and
the steering wheel's in my crotch.
Time it takes to sort it all out,
aliens'll have taken Newport.
JACK LAUGHS
What about a rota?
Different people drive on different
days.
We're a secret organisation,
hunting alien technology
from an underground base.
And you want a rota for who drives?
Just trying to help.
As soon as they're gone,
I'll be down.
Tosh, call up the radar within a
50-mile radius of the Bay
for the last six hours.
Gwen, check with that man - Neil, I
think his name was, voice like Sean
Connery - at Jodrell Bank.
See if they picked up any chatter
around the time of the sightings.
Owen, access the airspace provision
over Cardigan Bay, also any RAF
flightplans, see if it's just
a case of mistaken identity.
Take it slowly.
You're still very weak.
This way.
HE CHOKES
Is that Neil?
It's Gwen Cooper from Torchwood.
I know, we're always after
something, aren't we? Ianto!
Would you work some coffee magic?
Lisa!
Let me go!
I can help you.
The human race is weak.
I can make you strong.
What's happening?
Internal power drain.
What's causing it? Something big
to drain that amount of power.
Tosh, run a system diagnostic.
Actually...
We've been having generator
problems all evening.
I was down there checking earlier.
Couple of bits of cabling
have come loose.
I thought I'd fixed it.
Let me have another look.
Fine. Go check.
Want some help? It's fine.
ALARM BLARES
You've got to shut down the power!
Oh, God! Oh, my God!
What happened?! His upgrade failed.
Was it an accident?
Tell me you didn't do this!
I wanted to repay
him for helping me.
By removing the
weaknesses of his humanity.
What have you done?!
You've killed an innocent man!
It's all right. It's not all right!
They're gonna come looking for me in
a minute.
If they see the body, if they
find out what we've been doing...
I can deal with them.
Don't you go near them!
You didn't mean to do this.
Something's happened to your mind.
Um...just, um...
Some kind of side effect
from this whole process.
It's post-traumatic.
You didn't mean to...
You've ruined everything now!
How hard have we had to work
to keep you alive?
And now you do this.
I need you to stay in here.
Rest.
Don't come out unless I tell you.
This can't happen again, Lisa.
If you harm anyone else, I'll...
Yes?
What will you do?
OK, the body.
I've got to deal with the body.
I can do this.
This is my fault!
I'm responsible for this!
I'll hide the body.
Everything's gonna be OK.
That's a UFO?!
Only just! Arkan leisure
crawler, first generation.
Collectors' item, don't see
many of those around these days.
Tosh,
send a polite message saying great
to see them, but could they please
get the hell out of our atmosphere
they're spooking the locals. Done!
Shouldn't we be apprehending it?
Investigating it? Oh, please.
You interrogate an Arkan,
you'll be in there for a month.
And that's just the first question.
They are so boring.
Besides, they're mostly liquid,
the cells would be a mess.
There it goes again!
Ianto, we've got another dose of
darkness. You found anything?
ALARM BLARES
Ianto? I need to hear those
beautiful Welsh vowels!
Power's draining to the storeroom
at the bottom of the building.
Looking for human heat signals.
We've got... Two signals?
So assuming one's Ianto...
Who's the other?
I'm thinking we're under attack.
Security's been breached.
We assume battle protocols.
That's impossible!
Nobody can get in without triggering
seven separate alarms.
Yeah, well, looks like our
system needs to be upgraded.
I'll head down and look for Ianto.
I'll come with you.
You all right with that?
Keep your comms open at all times.
Any doubts, shoot first.
Priority is to find Ianto.
I'm sorry.
What's down here?
Normally? Nothing.
'Progress report?' Signs of...
'activity at the eastern end
of the main corridor.'
We're losing your comms signals.
We're going in to have a look.
Whatever that power source is,
it's interfering with the comms.
Gwen, Owen? Can you hear me?
Damn! Can we get them back?
Trying other channels. There's
something else you need to see.
I've gone back through our
internal CCTV footage for
the last couple of hours.
Someone's tried to remove
the images from our system.
See, now I'm starting
to get a little peeved.
These people come into my
house, start using my things...
I've dug into the system memory.
What the hell's going on here?!
Jack?
Tosh?
Gwen? Owen? Can you hear me?
No comms.
We're on our own, then.
What the hell is going on?
What's the matter?
I can't see well enough.
But there's something in there.
Some kind of operating table.
Get the bolts.
OK? Yeah.
OK, one, two...
No! No, no, no, no!
What the hell is it?!
It's wrong.
It's beyond wrong!
It shouldn't be here!
Turn the thing off! TURN IT OFF!
Internal levels are being restored!
Gwen? Owen? Can you hear me?
COMMS CRACKLE
These things brought down
Torchwood One.
But they were all destroyed.
Why is there one
in our bloody basement?!
Just tell me what it does!
It's the remnants
of a conversion unit.
This machinery
turns humans into Cybermen.
If I don't hear something within 30
seconds, I'm coming down there!
Jack, it's Gwen.
The comms dropped out.
We're back online now.
'Any sign of Ianto?' No.
But we have found parts
of a Cyber conversion unit.
'Fully powered up and working.'
This is no time to be
kidding around, Owen.
I'm deadly serious!
I dunno why it's here,
or how it got here.
But that's what's draining
our power.
Jack? You there? I want you
two back up here immediately!
We still haven't found...
Jack, code zero incursion. Repeat!
'Code zero incursion.
We're under attack.'
If you don't hear from me within
15 minutes, activate total shutdown
procedures and get
yourself to safety.
But I can't just leave you all here!
If there's a Cyberman in
this building, we need
a last line of defence.
Just make sure it never
gets to the outside world.
Whatever you... Whoever you are...
I don't mean you any harm.
But come any closer, I'll shoot.
SHE CHOKES
Let me go!
Do not struggle.
You will be like me.
GWEN CRIES IN PAIN
Throw down any weapons, put your
hands up and turn and face me!
GWEN SCREAMS
You're a woman! Owen! JACK!
GWEN SCREAMS
She doesn't know what she's doing!
You are fighting the wrong guy!
Get me out of here, someone, please!
Switch it off!
I'm trying!
She's changed all the circuits!
Shut off the power everywhere!
Toshiko, cut all power in the base!
I do that, the base goes into
lockdown! We'll be trapped.
Just do it!
Switch it off!
Gwen? I'm fine. I'm fine, I'm fine.
Sort of.
Jack, please get me out of here!
It's all right.
Where is she? Where did she go?
Please tell me you got her!
Stand guard by the door.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry. What for?
Let's just get out of here.
Clear? Clear.
Oh, God, there she is. What is she?
Some form of Cyberman.
They're us, upgraded.
Humans with emotions removed,
created on a parallel world and
supposedly destroyed on this one.
What are we gonna do? I don't know.
She's gone.
GUN CLICKS
Get us back to the Hub.
Jack, what are you doing?!
Resisting the urge to shoot.
Tosh, get everything from the
weapons room. Fast as you can.
It's locked down, there's no manual
override. Just open the store!
On your knees! Hands above your
head! Jack, for God's sake! What are
you doing?! I gave you an order!
Gwen, help her!
Did you know that thing
was down there? I put her there.
You hid a Cyberman
within Torchwood?!
And you didn't tell us?
What else are you keeping from us?
Like you care. I clear up your shit.
No questions asked
and that's the way you like it.
When did you last
ask me anything about my life?
Her name's Lisa.
She's my girlfriend. Why didn't you
tell us? We could have helped you.
Torchwood exists to destroy
alien threats.
Why would I tell you about her?
A little loyalty, perhaps?
My loyalty's to her!
She worked for Torchwood.
She was caught up in battle.
I owe it to Lisa...
WE owe it to her...
to find a cure.
Ianto, you have to believe me.
There is no cure.
There never will be. Those who
are converted stay that way.
Your girlfriend will
not be the exception.
You can't know that for sure.
Look, you need to know
what's happening here.
Because this is where these things
start. Small decisions
that become mass slaughter.
These creatures regain a foothold
by exploiting human weakness.
Then they take a base.
Rebuild their forces. And before
you know it, the Cyber race is
spreading out across the universe,
erasing worlds,
assimilating populations.
All because of the
tiny beginnings here.
We need to stop her...together!
You're not listening to me!
The conversion was never completed!
She already tried to kill Gwen!
You think she's gonna stop there?
There is no turning back for
her now! I'm...not giving up on her.
I love her.
Can you understand that, Jack?
Haven't you ever loved anyone?
You need to figure out
whose side you're on here.
Because if you don't know...
you're not going to make it
out of this alive.
There's no way this weapons
store's gonna open.
It's going to take six hours for
the power to come back online.
Let me talk to her.
I can still save her.
Save all of us.
She's not a monster.
MECHANICAL WHIRRING
Ianto!
Lisa... It's me.
You can't just let him go... Ssh!
The army will be rebuilt
from here.
This building is suitable.
Who are you?   Human point two.
No! Lisa...
So how come you look
like human point one?
I do not understand.
Look at yourself. Go ahead.
Remember, Lisa.
Remember who you are.
The upgrade is incomplete.
You're still human.
I am...
disgusting.
I have...
I am...
wrong.  We can help you.
I must start again.
Upgrade properly.  For God's sake!
Have you heard yourself?
Lisa, please.
I brought you here to heal you.
So we could be together.
Together. Yes. Transplant
my brain into your body.
The two of us...together.
Fused.
We'll be one complete person.
Isn't that what love is?
No.
Then we are not compatible.
Argh!
Code Nine manoeuvres. Go!
Gwen! Gwen! Get out of there!
Lisa! What you waiting for?
Run. We all ran.
She's coming after us. There's a
surprise(!) Could you be any less
helpful?! I just helped you escape!
Shut up, both of you!
OK, now,
this is a fight to the death.
We do whatever is necessary
to destroy her.
Forget what Ianto said.
That thing is not human. Clear?
Yeah, yeah.
What's this? Something Suzie
scavenged. She claimed that it could
open any lock in 45 seconds.
I want you out the exit gates up
the emergency stairs to reception.
She'll never open that door
without power! It weighs a ton!
Anyway, I'm not leaving you here!
Just do as I say! All of you!
Once in reception...
panel next to the desk,
pull it out.
Take circuit 357 from the main
system and patch it to these.
There should be enough power
in there for what we need.
Once the main circuit goes live,
get out. Meet us by the water tower.
Go! ..You two...find anything
that even resembles a weapon.
Autopsy room. There should be
some lethal equipment... What are you
gonna do? Buy you some time. Go!
Hey! Lisa!
It is Lisa, isn't it?
You've been hiding in my basement.
That's OK.
Draining my power,
I can live with that...
But now you're starting to hurt my
friends. This is gonna stop!
Come on!
This building belongs to me now.
You will all be deleted...
I'm sorry for what they did to you.
But this ends here.
How did he survive that?
Is that all you got?
I'm not so easily deleted.
We can't help him.
Shit!
Is there another exit? No!
We're trapped?!
Get in!
No way!
Lie on top of me and it'll take us
both. I'm not laying on top of you!
I'm not saying it's a brilliant idea,
but it's the only one we've got!
What do we do?
IANTO PANTS
(Ssh!)
MOBILE PHONE RINGS
Where is it?
Quick, please! Turn it off!
Turn it off!
All right, lover,
it's the man of your dreams!
I've had a couple of beers with
Daf and we're off for a curry,
so can you video Wife Swap?
Don't you touch her!
LISA SCREAMS
What the hell was that?
What? Snogging me!
Last kiss for the condemned man!
Little embarrassing given
we haven't been killed.
What?! It's not like I fancy you or
anything. I was on top of you.
I could feel your hard-on.
Yeah, well,
you didn't exactly struggle, did you?
It was kill or be killed.
Owen's right. There was no choice.
Ianto, move! Get out!
GET OUT I SAID! MOVE! MOVE!
You should be dead.
I'm the stubborn type.
Get behind me!
357, 357, come on!
That's right. Stay back.
This'll at least give you heartburn.
The power will run out.
I can wait.  Jack, help her.
Give her a chance to surrender...
Have you not seen what she's done?
Let her stay in the cells!
We have to reverse the process!
I've told you! We're past that!
Hold him back! What are you gonna
do? Don't ask questions, just
get him on there and hold him!
What is that stuff?
Kind of a barbecue sauce.
It helps identify its food.
Help what identify its food?!
I'm sorry.
PTERODACTYL SQUEALS
You'll kill her!
Let me go! Let me help her!
Yes!
Hold him still!
NO!
Call it off her! You can do that!
Have some fucking mercy!
NO-O-O!
It worked!
What happened to...? No.
You could have saved her! Argh!
You're worse than anything
locked up down there!
One day,
I'll have the chance to save you...
and I'll watch you suffer and die.
It was the only thing
that would stop her!
Listen, when I was at reception, I
managed to trip the lockdown timer.
The power should be coming back
on any second. We can get back in.
Ianto!
Pizza!
DOOR BUZZES
Ianto?
Bloody hell!
Ianto? D'you want these or not?
PTERODACTYL SQUEALS
Ianto! Stop!
She can't have survived that attack.
I used my initiative! I'm sorry!
When I want you to think for
yourself, I'll tell you.
Maybe if you'd told me
your plan, I wouldn't have done it!
Ianto, don't be stupid!
I've nothing left to lose. There's
always something left to lose.
I'm going back in to save her.
Anybody tries to stop me, I'll
shoot them. Ianto, put the gun...
You make a threat like that,
you better be prepared
to follow it through.
See, you disobey me now...
I really will shoot you. Get off me!
You wanna go back in there?
You go in to finish the job.
If she's still alive,
you execute her.
No way. You brought this down on us.
You hid her.
You hid yourself from us.
Now it's time for you
to stand as part of the team.
Jack... The girl you loved has gone.
Your loyalty is to us now.
You can't order me to do that.
You execute her or
I'll execute you both!
I won't do it. You can't make me.
You like to think you're a hero.
But you're the
biggest monster of all.
I'm giving you ten minutes.
Then we're coming in.
Pick it up.
How can you ask him...?
I don't need your opinion!
PTERODACTYL SQUEALS
Lisa!
Ianto...
Ianto, it's me. It's Lisa.
I'm human again.
You fought so hard for me, I had
to hold on for you, so I took this
body and transplanted the brain.
You're not Lisa.
You always said you didn't love
me for what I looked like.
Last time you said that,
it was a Saturday.
We were hungover.
You made cheese toasties, and
moaned I hadn't descaled my kettle.
That night, we camped
on a beach in Brittany.
It got so freezing we wore our
coats and shared one sleeping bag.
When we woke up the next morning,
a dog was pissing on our tent.
Hold me, Ianto.
I need you to hold me.
I need you to tell me
it's all right.
HE CRIES
GUN CLICKS
What are you doing?
Ianto, it's me!
You wouldn't shoot me.
I did this for you!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Lisa!
We can be upgraded together.
ALARM BLARES
You'd never have shot him.
Not really.
Wouldn't I? Would you have shot
me if I'd gone to stand by him?
But you didn't.
If I had, though. But you didn't.
Will he stay?
All that deception.
Because he couldn't
bear to live without her.
So have you ever loved anyone
that much?
When she had hold of you, I thought,
just for a moment, I thought
maybe you could die after all.
Wanna know a secret?
So did I.
And just for a second there,
I felt so...alive.
Are you kidding me?
That's him, we have to find him
before all hell let's loose.
It's little girls, their little
bodies. No-one can hurt me.
They protect their own,
their chosen ones.
Are you saying our
machines can't pick them up?
Nothing can.
She was beautiful,
I loved her at first sight.
It's gone crazy.
No!
This means these creatures
can invade my life whenever they
feel like it and I am scared, Jack.
For the sake of the world,
this is our only chance!
Torchwood. Outside the Government,
beyond the Police.
Tracking down alien life on Earth,
arming the human race against
the future.
The 21st century is when
everything changes
and you've got to be ready.

Well, shall I call the school?
Don't be stupid.
She'll be all right.

EERIE, 'LIQUID' VOICE:
Come away, oh, human child!
Oh!
Come away... Come away....
What exactly are we doing here?
I've had an invitation
from an old friend.
Here we go.
FLUTTERING OF WINGS
Fairies? Are you kidding me?
I suppose I'm one of the
fortunate few who's been allowed
to see our little friends.
And it's been no easy task.
One needs to have the
patience of a saint
and the blind faith of a prophet.
But for me the long
wait has been worthwhile.
This is my first picture.
Not that clear, I know, but
the ring of stones can be seen
quite distinctly.
I don't believe this. Shh!
Well, of course, I'm not the
world's best photographer.
But this little person
is just about visible.
I was so lucky to have seen them,
so privileged to witness
such a magical moment.
Because fairies are shy, you see.
But I know in my heart that they're
friendly, loving creatures.
Thank you.
POLITE APPLAUSE
Wrong. She always gets it wrong.
Estelle, when did you take these?
A couple of nights ago. Where?
In Roundstone Wood.
Not far from here.
So good to see you again, Jack.
Oh, look, there's the wood.
HE SIGHS
What's wrong? Oh, Jack and I have
always disagreed about fairies.
I only see the good ones.
He only ever sees the bad.
They're all bad.
No. I refuse to believe that.
I suppose one person's good
could be somebody else's evil.
That's what his father used to say.
Oh, Jack, if only you had
seen them there in the wood.
They were happy. They were dancing.
The fairy lights were shining.
Do you have any more photos?
Yes, at home. Right.
I need to see them all.

Oh, God, help me! Help me, please!
All right, mate. Just calm down.
Hey, hold on, will you?
I said, just bloody help me!
Right, that's it...you crazy bastard!
No! No, please...
Where was she?
Walking home on her own.
Jas, come here.
Do what your mum says.
You're not my dad.
Just bloody well do what she says.
You must never walk home on your
own, you understand? It's not safe.
It's all right, Mum.
No-one can hurt me.
Oh, thank you, Jack.
This is Moses.
Hello, Moses. They're mostly
just pictures of the area.
Come on, my darling, it's quite
time you went outside, isn't it?
This is you.
Sorry. No, that's my dad.
He and Estelle were
quite an item once upon a time.
They were inseparable.
Then why did they part?
It was wartime, he was posted abroad,
she volunteered to work on the land.
It just happened that way.
WIND CHIMES RING
If you don't mind me asking, did you
know Jack's father after the war?
No. We lost touch. Why?
Did all three of you ever meet?
You, Jack and his father?
No. Never.
Jack contacted me a few years ago.
I was so surprised.
He's so like his dad.
Same walk, same smile.
I hope he's still alive.
He'll be in his early nineties now.
You could always ask Jack about him.
I have, but he doesn't seem to
want to talk about his father.
Estelle, when you next see these
creatures you call us immediately,
understand? Mm-hm.
Night or day,
it doesn't matter, just call us.
And be careful, it's important to me.
But, Jack,
I've nothing to worry about.
Just be careful. Please.
Estelle shouldn't be living in town.
She belongs in the countryside.
How often do you get to see her?
We meet up now and again.
Whenever she's seen her fairies?
She calls them fairies. I don't.
What do you call them?
They've never really
had a proper name.
Why not?
Something from the dawn of time -
how could you
possibly put a name to that?
Are we talking alien? Worse.
How come?
Because they're part of us,
part of our world, yet
we know nothing about them.
So we pretend to know what they
look like. We see them as happy.
We imagine they have tiny little
wings and are bathed in moonlight.
But they're not? No.
Think dangerous, think something
you can only half see like a glimpse,
like something out of the corner
of your eye with a touch of myth,
a touch of the spirit world, a touch
of reality, all jumbled together.
Old moments and memories
that are frozen in amongst it.
Like debris spinning around a ringed
planet - tossing, turning, whirling.
Then backwards and
forwards through time.
If that's them we have to find
them...before all hell breaks loose.
Why won't she play anywhere else?
She likes it down there.
Other kids have friends.
Where's her friends?
Must be something wrong with her.
There's nothing wrong with her.
Well, when's the last time
you saw her watching TV?
Or reading a book?
Or playing with a doll?
Or sitting down to
have a chat with us?
When's the last time
you heard her laugh?
BEATING OF WINGS
EERIE VOICE: Come away, oh,
human child, come away.
LAUGHTER, BEATING OF WINGS
This is the youngest girl.
And the girl's cousin.
I blame it on magic mushrooms.
What you do in private
is none of our business.
But these photographs were fake.
Conan Doyle believed in them.
He was gaga at the time.
And Houdini. Self-publicist.
How do you know so much about it?
I wrote an essay on the Cottingley
glass-plate photos
when I was at school.
HE SNIGGERS
And when the girls were old ladies
they admitted they were fakes.
So where was THIS sighting then?
In a place called Roundstone Wood.
I know it. Has an odd history.
How d'you mean odd?
It's always stayed wild.
In ancient times it was considered
bad luck to walk in there
or even to collect timber.
Even the Romans stayed clear of it.
I've had no report of any sighting.
You won't. These things come in
under the radar,
but they play tricks with the
weather, so set up a programme for
unnatural weather patterns.
Right. Are you saying our
machines can't pick them up?
Nothing can.
What is it? Is it-is it God?
Some-somewhere safe, that's all I
want, just put me somewhere safe.
Got a right one here.
They tried to kill me!
Said there were flowers in his mouth.
Flowers? They're trying to choke me.
We checked. There was nothing.
They didn't want to hurt
that little girl. It's just me.
They just want to hurt me,
to kill me.
Who wants to hurt you? They won't
leave me alone. I've done wrong.
What d'you mean you've done wrong?
If it's God, I'm sorry,
I can't help it!
Name?
It's little girls...
It's their little bodies,
it's their little smiles.
They're bright as buttons.
Look, um, I've been in trouble
before...
So just help me!
JUST LOCK ME UP!
Please.
I asked Estelle about your dad.
She said she'd never seen
the pair of you together.
Why would she? She lost
touch with him after the war.
I just happened to catch
up with her later.
Oh.
BEATING OF WINGS
The stones in those photographs.
You know, this whole area was
forest in primeval times.
Most of the development areas
have been built on ley lines.
Anyone could have made this circle.
Why do you keep doubting me?
I spell out the dangers,
you keep looking for explanations.
That's what police work's about.
This isn't police work. All right,
science. It's not science.
I know. You told me.
It's that corner-of-the-eye stuff.

I heard you laughing, Jas.
It seemed like you
were talking to someone.
Just talking to yourself, were you?
It's lovely to hear you laugh.
I thought I'd seen everything
until now.
We had him locked up,
for Christ's sake, on his own.
He was shouting the odds.
Said things were following him.
What kind of things?
Shadows, he said. He was
going on about being choked.
There were four other prisoners.
They saw nothing.
Where are they now?
I've had them transferred. CCTV?
I'm dealing with that.
At first I thought he was a
drunk or a nutcase, or both.
Right, I want this place locked off.
Name? Mark Goodson. Worked in town.
Business consultant. Cause of death?
Well, going by the pinpoint
haemorrhages on the eye-lids and
around the hairline,
I'd say oxygen deficiency.
But it's odd.
There's no fingertip bruising
on the face, no areas of pallor.
Nothing to suggest that
pressure was applied? No.
Yet he suffocated
alone in a locked cell?
Looks like it.
Wait a minute.

I've never seen
anything like that before.

Oh...! Oh!
We know the dead man
was a convicted paedophile,
used to hang around schools.
Why the petals in his mouth?
Just a bit of fun on their part.
You call that fun?
That's the way these
creatures like to do things.
They play games,
they torment and they kill. Why?
As a punishment
or a warning to others.
They protect their own.
The chosen ones.
Somehow children and the
spirit world, they go together.
So how do we stop them?
First we have to find out who
they want.
And we can't trap them.
They have control of the elements -
fire, water, the air that we breathe.
They can drag that air
right out of our bodies.
Sometimes I think they're part Mara.
Mara?
Kind of malignant wraiths.
It's where the word
nightmare came from.
They suffocate people in their sleep.

Yeah? Jack, it's me, Estelle.
What is it? You were right, Jack.
There are bad ones.
They've come to me.

near them, do you understand? Yes.

Estelle!
Looks like she died from drowning.
The rest of the

It wasn't your dad that
was in love with her all
those years ago, was it?
It was you.
We once made a vow.
We'd be with each other till we died.
HE KISSES HER HEAD
HE SIGHS
I need a drink.
Where did you and Estelle meet?
In London at the Astoria ballroom
a few weeks before Christmas.
She was 17 years old
and she was beautiful.
I loved her at first sight.
But nothing lasted back then.
Promises were always being broken.
Estelle...
to have to die like that.
The petals in Goodson's mouth,
where had you seen that before?
Was that during the war?
No.
Long before then.
On a troop train.

We thought some birds had
flown in through an open window.
Then came the silence.
And when we came out of the tunnel,
all 15 men were dead.
They'd been suffocated.
My squad. Men I was responsible for.
But why were the men killed?
About a week earlier some
of them had got drunk.
Drove a truck through a village,
ran over a child, killed her.
That child was a chosen one.

You OK? No. I've had a bit of
a weird day actually.
Bloody hell!
What the hell's gone on here?
How'd they get in? They smashed
everything up, the bastards!
I'll fetch you straight home
from school, Jas.
You don't want to
miss our party, do you?
I'd rather play down the garden.
You're right. She's spending too
much time down there. Don't worry.
I'm going to put a stop to things.
So what are you going to do
when they start building at
the bottom of the garden?
It'll happen one day.

Don't you ever want to

Yes, Miss. Who?
Don't know, Miss.
Come here.
In the whole of my working
life I have never had to bring
the bad times home with me.
I have never had to feel
threatened in my own home.
But not any more, because this means
these creatures can invade my life
whenever they feel like it
and I am scared, Jack.
What chance did Estelle have?
What chance do any of us have?
You said these creatures
protect their own. Yeah.
You mentioned the chosen ones.
What are they? How many are there?
Tell me, Jack!
All these so-called fairies were
children once from different moments
in time, going back millennia.
Part of the lost lands.
Lost lands? What?
The lands that belong to them.
What exactly do they want?
Why are they here?
They want what's theirs -
the next chosen one.

Two children were almost scared to
death, but they're OK. What is it?
I saw them. And there was
little Jasmine in amongst it all.
She hadn't been touched.
The sun was shining down on her.
It was...it was like an aura,
like something protecting her.
Who is Jasmine? Jasmine Pearce. She's
a pupil of mine. Where is she now?
We're sending all the children home.
We have to. Yeah, thanks.
The chosen one? Yeah.
MUSIC PLAYS, PEOPLE CHATTER
Must have been
scary at school today.
It was fun.
Roy said you saw some of
your friends this morning.
He said you waved at them.
Only Roy said when he
looked he couldn't see anyone.
That's because they
were in the trees.
Trees? What trees?
The trees along the road.
Is this one of your games, Jas?
No.
Ah, boy, not got a beer?
So who are they?
Just friends. You should have
invited them to the party.
They don't like parties.
I'm not surprised if
they live in trees.
Oh, they don't always live in trees.
They can be anywhere and everywhere.
They can even be in this room.
In this room? When?
Now. Don't be silly, Jas.
So where did you meet these friends?
You must have met them somewhere.
They said they'll always look
after me, even through time.
When did they say that? I forget.
Oh, yeah, I've got big plans for
this place, going to extend the
patio and landscape this garden.
Come on, Jas, hurry up with
that food. People are hungry.
So when are you going to name
the day, Roy? Shoo, never.
I can't afford to keep her.
No! No! Please, no! No...
Jas, get away. You can't do this!
That's my own place! It's mine!
I said, get away! Oh, Jas!
Ow!
Ah! You little bitch!

Well, you are.
It looks like a very old forest, and
it's magical. I want to stay in it.
You can see this forest?
Yes. But it's not here.
It's just an illusion, Jasmine.
It is.
WHIRRING OF WINGS
Your friends are just
playing a game with you.
The real forest can never come back.
Oh, it can.
When they take me to it.
They told you this?
But what about your mother?
Don't you want to stay with her?

No. She lives forever.
Jas? Where's Jas?
Please, wait.
You can't go down there. No! Jas!
No, no! Let go! My daughter!
Suppose we make her stay with us?
Then lots more people will die.
Did they tell you that?
They promised.
Come away, oh, human child!
Next time they'll kill
everyone at my school
like they killed Roy
and that man and your friend.
How do you know these things?
If they want to they can make
great storms, wild seas,
turn the world to ice.
Kill every living thing.
Let me go.
The child won't be harmed?
Jack, you can't...
Answer me! She won't be harmed?
We told you. She lives forever.
A dead world.
Is that what you want?
What good is that to you?
There will be no more chosen ones.
EERIE VOICE:
They'll find us. Back in time.
Take her.
Jack, NO!
You asked me what chance we had
against them. For the sake of the

I hate the countryside.
It's dirty, it's unhygienic.
And what is that smell?
That would be grass.
It's disgusting.
Seventeen disappearances
within the last five months.
Police are clueless.
Now there's a surprise.
No offence, PC Cooper.
The last known whereabouts of
each one is somewhere around here.
All within a 20-mile radius.
Anything else linking them? None
of the bodies have ever been found.
These people just fell off
the radar. No patterns in age,
sex, race.
One minute they're here, the next...
boof. Gone.
The rift doesn't spread
out this far. Does it?
We don't know that much
about it to be certain.
And it's increasing in
activity all the time.
Come on, aliens aren't gonna
bother hanging around out here.
Probably some sort of
weird suicide club with people
choosing the same spot to end it all.
God knows, if I had to spend too
long up here, I'd want to top myself.
Here you go.
Careful, they're hot.
Sure you don't want anything, Tosh?
Really sure.
A friend of mine caught
hepatitis off a burger
from one of these places.
We'll start with the most
recent victim, Ellie Johnson.
We last have record of
her making a phone call.
She dropped out of signal mid-call.
The coverage map has her placed...
somewhere about here.
Looks as good a place
as any to set up camp.
Sorry, did you say camp?
What's the matter with a hotel?
People are going missing round here.
D'you really wanna stay in
a place run by strangers?
Cos sleeping outside
is a lot safer(!)
No other race
in the universe goes camping.
Celebrate your own uniqueness.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Need a hand getting it up, Owen?
If I did, I wouldn't ask you.
Some pieces are missing!
No. I checked.
HEAVY BREATHING
Oh, come on! It's just a bit of fun!
Who was the last person you snogged?
See! You even sound
like an eight-year-old!
Who the hell says "snog"?
Mine was... Rhys!
Yeah, well, there's a surprise.
Tosh, your go. It's easy for you!
Oh, come on! Spill the beans!
Owen. What?
Really? Tosh, in your dreams.
3am, Christmas Eve,
in front of the Millennium Centre.
Waiting for a cab. I had mistletoe.
Christmas?! You've not had
a snog since. No.
Well.
Lucky me, eh?
So who was yours?
Gwen, actually.
When was this?
It was complicated.
Didn't take you long to get
your feet under the table.
What?
So was it just a kiss, or...
Tosh, leave it.
Jack?
Are we including non-human
lifeforms? Oh, you haven't!
You're a sick man, Harkness!
That is disgusting!
I never know when he's joking.
It's my turn, is it?
It was Lisa.
Ianto, I'm sorry...
Sorry she's dead?
Or sorry you mentioned it?
I just didn't think.
You forgot.
We should get some firewood.
I'll give you a hand.
Couldn't you have kept
that to yourself?
What's the matter, you embarrassed?
You're such an arrogant
shit sometimes, Owen!
That was a good kiss. It was
borderline great. So good, you've
been avoiding me ever since.
Country air's making you delusional.
How long did it last? Ten seconds?
But the things I can tell
from that kiss. Oh, like?
Like your sex life ain't up to much.
You what?!
Y'see old Rhys makes the
earth rumble, but he don't
make it move, does he?
You might want to shut
up before I lamp you one.
When was the last time
you screwed all night?
When was the last time you
came so hard, and so long,
you forgot where you are?
Doesn't happen with him,
does it? You're too familiar.
Whereas, you and me,
we're not cosy at all.
We'd be amazing!
And that scares the shit out of you.
Someone's watching us.
Through the trees.
50 yards north.
I just saw them move.
You got your gun? Yes.
You go to your left.
I'll go right.
Three...two...one.
BIRD FLIES OFF
Bollocks! How did we lose them? Owen.
Well, it's not Ellie Johnson,
that's for sure.
This is a male, late 40s, 50s.
Wasn't killed here. No blood
spatter or signs of a struggle.
Must have been brought here after he
died. Why do that? It's not like
they've tried to bury him here.
Maybe you disturbed them and they
ran away. Maybe it's a warning.
Whoever's responsible
marking out their territory.
Cause of death? Impossible to say.
The body's been stripped of
the flesh and bodily organs.
Could the Weevils
have come out this far?
No, Weevils don't finish
off their victims like this.
CAR ENGINE STARTS
Is that ours? Yeah.
All right! I've said I'm sorry!
Basic security protocols, Owen!
Oh, get off your high horse, Tosh!
I was carrying that stupid gear.
What, the whole time? and then I was
trying to put that bloody tent up.
And then... Yes, I sort of forgot
that I'd left them in there.
But I'm sorry.
I'm human. I ballsed up. Looks
like that body wasn't a warning.
More of a decoy.
That would mean we've been
watched since we've arrived.
Tosh, can you get a tracking signal?
Already done. I took the liberty.
It's currently 3.4 miles
west from here.
Gunning at ninety, no doubt. You
steal a piece of equipment like that,
you drive straight on till morning.
Actually, no. It's been stationary
for the past four minutes.
I'd go so far as to say it was
parked. There's a small
village in that area.
Other than that, nothing for 30
miles. Call me suspicious, but this
has all the hallmarks of a trap.
Yeah, I was just
thinking the same thing.
Anyone fancy a walk?
Why would anyone want to live
out here? Has the SUV moved?
Not for an hour now.
HEAVY BREATHING
Tosh, Ianto - follow
the signal, find the SUV.
Owen, Gwen...
Let's see
if there's any room at the inn.
Pint of best please, love.
And em, yeah, get one for yourself.
Where is everybody?
SHE RETCHES
You OK? In there.
That burger coming back to haunt
you?
Oh, my God...
Gwen!
Jack please...
something's going on here.
Let's take a look in here?
Come on.
One, two, three...
What is it?
There's another body in there.
Same as the other?
What did this, Jack? Cos whatever
it is, it can't be human.
How far is this going to spread?
Stay focused. I should be
having dinner with Rhys.
What am I doing here with you?!
Don't you ever get scared, Jack?
Huh?
There's another two houses.
We'd better take a look.
Whatever they were,
I hope you put up a good fight.
It's just half a mile up here.
Least we've still got this.
Rest of my stuff was in the vehicle.
DISTANT YELP
What was that?
Just a...fox
or something.
Check round the back. Yeah.
ANIMAL YELP
We should carry on straight up there.
Tosh!
Tosh!
Tosh!
Locked? Locked.
Gwen! Gwen!
Gwen! Gwen.
Put the gun on the floor!
PUT THE GUN DOWN ON THE FLOOR!
I thought you were them!
I thought they'd come back for me!
Thought who had come back for you?
WHO?!
Gwen...Gwen!
Gwen, what's happened?
A kid hit her with a shotgun.
I got you, I got you.
Move, move!
Get in.
OK, I'll check upstairs.
Owen! Owen! Bet you thought
you'd never be glad to see me!
Right... Help me!
Listen, listen, I'm going to
have a look at your wound now, OK?
Just keep calm.
Hands off, hands off. OK.
No, don't please!
Right, it could've been much worse.
Hold this apply pressure.
Oh, Jesus! The bullets are lodged
near the surface.
You've been bloody lucky, girl.
Another inch to the left
and any one of your vital
organs might've been... Anyway.
D'you want a quip about
feeling a small prick?
No, but thanks for offering.
Here we go.
All done. GOD!
Let's get these pellets out, eh?
Right, there's gonna be
a certain amount of residue.
So just lie back
and think of Torchwood.
D'you miss being a doctor?
Excuse me,
I still am a doctor.
I just don't deal with
patients any more, that's all.
It's ideal.
That was the bit I always hated.
You beauty.
Come on. I'm good.
Not bad.
What's taking Tosh and Ianto so
long? Jack, the SUV might be locked
up. Or they could be dead!
Well, everyone else is. Sit down!
Tell us what happened here.
It's not human. Look,
my mum won't know what's happened.
They're expecting me
back for the weekend.
Look, we'll get you home OK.
What are you going to do?
You can't fight them.
They're too strong. The only thing
we can do is barricade the door.
No! We'll make base at the pub.
Should we go after Tosh and Ianto?
Not till we know what we're dealing
with. But what if it's too late?
They're not children.
They know what to do.
Let's go.
It's all right. I've got her.
Owen, I want to do it on my own.
Look, I'm sorry about your friends.
You know, I never liked camping.
Don't bother. They took the guns.
Charming place they've got.
Judging by
the sound reverberations...
and the air quality,
pretty deep underground.
Chances of rescue? We won't need
rescuing. I haven't met a cell yet
I couldn't get out of.
What were they? I don't know.
It happened too quickly.
Are you worried?
A little. Only...
that body we saw, in the forest.
Don't think about it.
See if you can get
that light to work, huh?
You're used to this, aren't you?
That facial expression you all share.
When things get a bit...
out of control.
Like you enjoy it.
Like you get a high from the danger.
You want me to apologise for that?
Don't you ever wonder how long you
can survive before you go mad,
or get killed, or lose a loved one?
It's worth the risk.
To protect people.
And who protects us?!
God, I'm hungry. You should
have had that cheeseburger.
Not THAT hungry.
What's that?
You've found something?
It's just a shoe.
Wait, there's another.
There's dozens of them.
Oh, my God...
How many people have been down here?
And what happened to them?
Is that a fridge?
Tosh, what is it, what's in there?
Tell me!
Ianto, don't. I want to know!
That's why there was
nothing left on the body.
They need to eat.
We're food.
So, if we barricade ourselves in,
what happens to Tosh and Ianto?
Why are we still talking about this?
Tosh and Ianto can look after
themselves.
The kid is our first responsibility
and they've already been for him
once. They're not going to give up.
So have we ever heard of a species
who strip human bodies of flesh
and organs? You need to rest.
I'm compiling what we've got.
Seeing if it helps.
We have to assume the others who
disappeared have been killed.
17 deaths? At least.
These aren't casual killers.
OK. So all this means
is the rift is spreading.
Dumping aliens and psychos
wherever it fancies. Looks like that.
Great. This conversation's
cheered me up no end.
Did you see that? Something outside?
Was that the same one or different?
He said they'd come back.
Let's not jump to conclusions.
We don't know who they are
or what their intentions are.
I'm thinking that's not a good sign.
They've come back.
Kieran, listen to my voice, OK.
Just come back. Kieran!
OK, so we didn't check the cellar.
You can't let them in! Come back
from the door. Don't let them in!
Sit down! We've got this under
control! You don't understand, you
don't know what they're like.
No, please...please, no, not me...!
Kieran! HELP ME!
It's pitch black. You don't have any
tracking devices! Wanna get yourself
killed? Get out of my way!
Look whatever's in that cellar
took three bullets. I heard it fall.
Once we know what it is, we'll know
how to deal with it. You do that.
We'll go after Kieran
and the others. You are wounded!
Do you think that's gonna stop me?!
Be careful.
Go.
Got to be three steel bolts -
top, middle and bottom.
How are you at calculating
target stress points?
Find the weakest point,
bit of brute force...
Nice thought. But it's reinforced.
Get off! Look at me, you idiot!
I'm not gonna hurt you!
You've got a gun.
I promise, I promise.
OK, OK...give her some space.
Thank you.
Were you injured? When they took you?
Can I see? I'm a nurse.
OK, OK, OK.
Does anyone else know you're here?
Have you managed to call for help?
We don't need any help.
There's three more
of us in the village.
I can't help you.
I'm sorry.
What d'you mean?
I've been sent to collect you.
I've got to take you to them.
Tell us what's going on.
We can help.
No-one's safe.
Every ten years...
..it takes us again.
What takes you? What is it?
The Harvest.
No, please, you have to
come with me.
Help me.
Please...help. Did you attack us?
I'm dying, help me...
I'll tell you everything...
This'll help you for a short amount
of time. Now start talking.
You've got to get help.
I know where you can get some.
We had a deal.
I help you, you tell me where
they've taken the boy and what
the hell is going on around here.
HE LAUGHS MIRTHLESSLY
You don't know?
What are you doing?!
Put it back!
You need to know something.
A long time ago,
I was pretty good at torture.
Y'see, I had quite a
reputation as the go-to guy.
My job demanded
it at the time, you see.
So I know
where to apply the tiniest amount
of pressure to a wound like yours.
You've gotta stop,
you're gonna kill me. PLEASE STOP!!
It's in your power to get
me to stop.
Just tell me what I need to know.
Because in ten seconds,
I'm gonna find a sharp object.
Right.. All right.
I'll tell you everything,
just stop.
Now talk.
Are you sure you're all right?
Yeah, fine,
I'm fine.
That's all we bloody need.
Let me do the talking,
I'll get rid of him.
Who are you, please?
Special Ops. From Torchwood,
have you heard of Torchwood?
What's that then, a band is it?
What's wrong with her?
Mate, you wouldn't understand.
What's that light over there?
The Big House?
Sort of unofficial village hall.
Village meeting tonight, that's
why I'm here. Constabulary report.
Come on.
Where do you think you're going?
In there, please.
If you help us,
we can stop all this. Please.
I'm sorry. Get back.
Oh, God, that stench...
Tell us what these creatures are.
Do they look like us?
How else are we gonna look?
There are three more out there.
Not a problem. How are they?
They're in a good state.
I think they're the best
we've ever had. Yeah?
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
we caught the boy.
Finally.
Come on.
I won't tell anyone!
Who is he?
He's meat.
I'm afraid we're all just meat.
Get ready to run.
What're you going to do,
put us on meat hooks?
No, not yet.
You see...meat...
has to be tenderised first.
Go! Get the others!
I know you're here.
No-one's coming for you.
SHE SCREAMS
No more games.
Hush now.
SHE CHOKES
Get off her or I'll shoot!
GET OFF HER OR I'LL SHOOT!
We saw the torchlight.
They've murdered all the villagers.
They're cannibalising the bodies!
Put the gun down. You're in no
position to negotiate, mate.
S'all right, it's all right.
You're safe.
You can arrest him now.
I said you can arrest him!
You gonna arrest me, Huw?
That'd be a laugh, wouldn't it?
My own uncle.
Put the gun down,
don't you hurt him.
Shoot the bastard.
Split his skull.
Put the fucking gun down! Shoot.
I will shoot you! Put it down.
Pull the trigger, kill.
Why don't you give me the gun? Mate.
Who are these people?
This is our village.
But the villagers are dead.
They're all involved.
They've all been doing it.
This is our Harvest.
Only in the bloody countryside!
You sick fuckers.
Are you OK? Where's Ianto?
What have you done with him?
Wake up, man.
Time to be bled.
Like veal, it takes a long time.
But it definitely makes
the meat taste better.
What the fuck...?
Oh, really?
No, Jack! Don't do it. These people
don't deserve warnings.
Let me question him.
I have to understand.
I want to know why. Otherwise this,
this is too much.
They're injured,
they need to get to the hospital.
Owen you control the bleeding
and then phone the police. Jack,
please give me an hour with him.
Don't tell me you
don't want to know too.
The whole village was involved.
Every generation.
Our tradition.
Once a decade.
Target those travelling through,
those most likely to disappear.
And butcher them.
What sort of people are you
that you wake up in the morning and
think, this is what I'm going to do?
Why'd you do it?
Come on!
Make me understand.
Why do you care?
I have seen things you
would never believe.
And this is the only
thing I can't understand.
So, keep on wondering. Tell me!
I need to know why! That's enough.
Time to go.
I'll tell you something...
if you let me whisper.
OK.
(Cos it made me happy.)
Come on, out..
'I had a good job before this,
'I thought in a year
or two, perhaps a baby,
'I know Rhys would be a good dad and
I could try for Desk Sergeant and...
'Well, it was all
slotting into place...'
'And then I met you lot.
'All these things...
'..all these things,
they're changing me.
'Changing how I see the world.'
And I can't share them
with anyone.
You can now.
What is this thing? With this you
can read peoples minds, it levels
the pitch between man and God.
We'll find you.
My guess is you're not
from around these parts.
Shagging a woman on the rebound.
Wouldn't be the first time
I'd been a rebound shag.
You need to see this,
this is completely impossible.
Tell me what to do.
Get me into Torchwood.
Torchwood. Outside the Government,
beyond the Police.
Tracking down alien life
on Earth and arming the
human race against the future.
The 21st century is when
everything changes,
and you've got to be ready.
Nearly there.
We've been right busy since
you lot were billeted here.
This your first time?
The others been
teasing you, is that it?
My name's Mary.
Mary, like the virgin.
Religious man, are ya?
I'm not your bloody hound.
Whore!
METALLIC WHOOSHING
Do whores have prayers?
Once, just once, I'd like
to walk into one of these tents
and find it's a party.
You know, food, drink, people
dancing, girl crying in the corner.
Is it alien? And how.
I'm picking up traces of ilmenite,
pyroxene, and even Dark Matter.
Any idea what it is? Not a clue.
Could be a weapon,
or a really big stapler.
How's our friend there? She's dead.
Yeah, thanks, Quincy(!) She?
Judging by the size of her skull.
How long have they been here, Tosh?
From the depth they found them...
196 years, 11 to 11.5 months.
The earth's been disturbed so I'm
afraid I can't be more accurate.
What killed her? The stapler?
Nah. See those shattered ribs?
I reckon she was shot.
Well, let's get her back
to the Hub and find out.
You're so light! You're like a girl.
I'm not light, I'm wiry.
Fat girls go mad for it.
But I guess I don't need
to tell you that.
I'm really sorry, I think
your computer might be dead.
You're kidding. What happened?
OK, so she said I was no
good at sport... Hello?!
So I said,
"Throw something to me and..."
What happened to the computer? Oh.
I kicked out the plug.
What? It was running a
translation programme I'd written.
I'd collated every scrap of alien
language we've got,
and broken it
down into binary threads to see
if there was a common derivation.
That's a bit of a mouthful.
Sorry. Private joke. Um, stupid joke.
We're supposed to be professionals.
We've got a job to do. She's right.
You're right, Tosh, I'm sorry.
Do you know what, Tosh? Sometimes I
think even that stick up your arse
has got a stick up its arse.
The guy over there's been staring at
me all evening, and I told him he's
wasting his time but he won't listen,
so I've come over to talk to
you because I know how this ends -
he gets a punch in the neck
and I get barred, and I've already
been barred from about 20 pubs.
And I don't want to get barred
from this one because they do
these nice olives on the tables.
Right. OK, then.
Cool. Let me get you a drink.
Really, there's no need.
JD and Coke, and...
Toshiko, what do you want?
I didn't tell you my name.
Oh, yeah. That was the other thing.
I kind of know who you are. I think
you're mistaken. Toshiko Sato.
Born in London, 1975,
moved to Osaka when you were two,
then back to the UK in 1986.
Parents in the RAF,
grandfather worked at Bletchley Park.
Very impressive.
University...blah-blah,
snapped up to Government science
think tank when you were 20,
recruited to Torchwood
three years ago.
I saw you at the
building site this morning.
What was that you had in the case?
How do you know about Torchwood?
There's stuff on the internet,
but you have to dig really deep.
Plus, we pick bits and pieces up from
police radio scanners, we also... We?
Scavengers.
Collectors. Just like you.
How many of there are you?
Oh, listen, don't think
it's in any way organised.
It's really just a disparate bunch of
IT guys who live with their mothers.
I shouldn't talk to you.
So go.
What's most amazing are the
similarities with our own culture.
But that can be horrible,
because we find lots of weapons,
and it just makes you think,
"My God, everything wages war."
It's not just a trait of
ours, but a trait of existence.
It makes you feel so hopeless.
But then there are times...
We found this thing,
it was about A4 size,
and it had all these symbols on it.
And it took me about three months
to translate, and it was a letter
someone had written to his family,
to his children,
to say how much he was missing them.
And it just made me cry,
because I thought, even across
these unimaginable distances,
there are fundamentals that
stay exactly the same.
And there's no-one
to talk to about this. I mean,
the guys at work, they're great,
but they don't...
see it the way I do.
I could be fired...just
for telling you that.
I want to show you something.
It's a pendant. Put it on.
VOICES ECHO: I'll drink one more,
then just drive slowly. Does coffee
count as food if you take sugar?
If he tugs his groin one more time,
I'll smack him in the face...
I should have said it
was Hammer Time when she
asked what the time was.
That would have made them laugh.
What are they?
I can hear voices.
Bloody Sudoku...
Did I send that email?
Did I click "reply to all"?
They're people's thoughts.
He doesn't touch me any more.
They're people's thoughts, Toshiko.
'I wish I'd shagged
that single dad I met.'
'What's that Asian girl doing -
having a fit or something?'
It's... They're so loud.
'She's cute, though.
Is that her girlfriend?
'Marcus reckons he's done it
with two lesbians, lucky sod.
'How would it work?'
That man over there with...
I can hear him.
OK, Toshiko, I need you to focus.
I can hear all of them.
'Home in on my voice.
Shut everything else out.'
It's so... 'Just me. There's
no-one else but me. Can you hear me?
'Can you hear me now?
'OK, I want you to home
in on just MY thoughts.
'Ignore everything else.
There's just so much...'
'You can do it. It takes practice,
but this is what you have to learn.
'Now, what am I thinking?
'This is so hard...
'Follow my voice. What am I thinking?
'You're thinking...
That I want to kiss you...'
I'm sorry, that was...
No, look, it's...
Sometimes you can't control...
I know, it's fine.
Where did you get it?
It's been in the family a long time.
I've never seen anything like it.
It's incredible.
It's more than incredible. With this,
you can read people's minds. It
levels the pitch between man and God.
Is it alien? I guess.
No, I want you to keep it.
What? I can't, Mary. Please.
I've kept it too long.
After a while, it gets...
You hear too much.
It changes how you...see people.
I'll have to show it to the others.
What?
Nothing. Just, I bet you don't.
And you know this from finding
my CV on the internet?
No, because I know the pendant.
Well, you're wrong.
Because I will. Yeah. But you won't.
Good morning.
Yeah, hi...
Ianto.
'What the hell would produce
such a perfect circular puncture?
'Maybe some kind of wooden stake.
Hey, Tosh.
'She'd better not go into one
about the computer again.' Morning.
'Sergeant giving it all, "Oh, Gwennie
has deigned to call her old mates."
'Should put a weevil
in his bathroom.'
I've got something to show you.
Sure. 'Please don't make us sit
through another slideshow about
the Incas or whatever it was.
'I want a biscuit.'
Have I got time for a pee first?
'Oh, the jeans in the boots thing
has really kind of had its day.'
I...I found this thing...
'What's she talking about?
She can be dead weird.
'Wonder what she'd be like in bed.
Catholic but grateful, I bet.' OK.
Um, I don't know if this comes under
actual technology.
'I can smell Owen on me from that
shag in his car this morning.
'That's twice now - does that
make it an arrangement? Has to
be more than two times surely...
'Long as we keep it to just
the two times we're fine. What's
Tosh looking at?' You OK, Tosh?
'When she ran her
tongue across my teeth...
'I should have worn different
trousers - I'm gonna have to sit
down till this subsides a bit.'
Yeah. No. Fine.
So what is it you wanted to show us?
'I wonder if I could get Owen to come
down to the vault. No, couldn't
have sex in front of a weevil.
'I couldn't even do it in front of
Trevor Kendall's cat.' Forget it.
It's... I found this article...
I'll bring it in tomorrow.
No worries. 'But thanks for that
rambling trip to nowhere, Tosh.'
'Can't imagine the time
when this isn't everything.
'Pain so constant,
like my stomach's full of rats.
'Feels like this is all I am now.
'There isn't an inch of
me that doesn't hurt.'
I'm about to brew some of
Jack's industrial strength coffee.
Would you like a cup?
I'm... I'm fine. Thanks, Ianto.
Might have known you'd
have my address as well.
Did you tell them? No. I didn't.
What made you change your mind?
You listened to them, didn't you?
See, I told you! Isn't it incredible?
Some of the stuff you hear...
What is this thing?
Why did you give it to me?
I told you. The things I heard.
What they thought of me, what they
really thought. God, these are
people that are supposed to like me!
They do like you.
People are complicated, they...
OK, I should have
warned you about this.
It isn't like reading
someone's diary.
The stuff you've been hearing, it's
so deep, so personal - stuff they're
not even aware they're thinking.
You think you know someone, then
suddenly you see them for real,
and they're...bastard little kids.
Not everything. Not everyone.
I wouldn't say
your thoughts were exactly pure.
At least they're consistent.
No agenda. No resentment.
They pity me.
You don't pity me.
Why would I?
What you're thinking now, that's
pretty graphic.
That wasn't my thought. What?
I wasn't thinking anything,
that wasn't my thought.
It must have been yours.
That one! There! That's yours.
Yeah, that was mine. I, um,
certainly seem to be
enjoying myself.
You would. You will.
You have no ashtrays in
your whole house, not one.
What are you using?
I think it's an egg cup.
You OK?
Freaking out a little?
Your birthday's July, right?
You're the expert.
Isn't it a little late to
still have your cards up?
What? "Lots of love, Owen."
I'm guessing that's Owen from work.
Owen from the building
site yesterday morning.
Owen from the photo on your fridge.
Put that down.
All I'm saying is, I don't want
to get in the way of anything.
There's nothing to
get in the way of.
I see.
You want to talk about it?
Not really. It's OK.
Wouldn't be the first time
I'd been a rebound shag.
You weren't, OK?
Nothing's happened,
nothing will ever happen.
Just one of the delightful
things I found out,
thanks to your bloody pendant.
It's not all bad,
the pendant.
Some of the things it
can do are extraordinary.
What good could ever come of that?
You need to work that out for
yourself.
You need to go somewhere public,
somewhere crowded.
What am I looking for?
It will find you.
I'm sick of these riddles.
What's going on?
Where did you get this? I told you.
Who are you, Mary?
Is that even your real name?
OK.
Here's another name.
Philoctetes.
I'm Philoctetes.
MULTIPLE VOICES

All right, Danny?
I want him back at six.
And I mean six this time.
Kelly's given me 90 minutes
after-hours at the tanning
salon as a wedding present.
Besides, you're breaking the
law bringing him home late.
My dad reckons I could have
you arrested, so think on.
Hey. Get your shoes on and go
to the toilet. What's that face?
I don't wanna go. Well, you have to.
Lawrence will be here in a minute,
and we're looking at napkins.
It's boring.
Well, take your Space Invaders.
Lawrence bought him that.
Don't hear a peep out of him now.
Mind, that's Lawrence all over -
dead thoughtful. Not like some.
Oh, and no cola. I don't want
him coming home all excited.
Thought you'd stopped going fishing.
I have.
Oh, my God, Neil,
what are you doing?!
I was thinking of the Isle of Wight.
Do you remember?
We had that chalet...around
when Danny was walking,
and the chalet was just full of
spiders and you called me your hero,
because I wasn't scared - I'd just
pick them up and throw them out.
Oh, my God, Neil!
No, you're scaring me! And it
was this perfect little memory.
We were happy because
we were together.
And all this nonsense
with Lawrence, it's fine,
I forgive you.
Because I'm looking at
the bigger picture now.
Oh, my God!
Oh, Christ! Oh, no, don't! Please!
It's OK, it's just like
falling asleep. Really.
Don't do this, to Danny, please!
And then we will
be together forever.
It's OK. You're OK now.
Plodders.
# The leg bone's connected
to the hip bone... #
Please stop singing.
Anything to stop you singing!
I don't know what
you're laughing at!
Stop singing, please don't
sing, please don't sing.
What's going on?
You know the skeleton we
found at the site?
Well, Amanda Burton here has just
completed the post-mortem.
OK, I can explain.
As you may remember, at the building
site, Owen said this was a woman
killed by a single gunshot.
I'd been there, like, a minute?
Since then he's had to tweak
some of his initial conclusions.
The first being that this isn't, in
fact, a woman, but a man.
A young man. A very girly man.
But still ultimately a man.
Then there was the cause of death.
Owen said GSW. Uh-UHH!
The correct answer was...
Unidentified trauma.
But... Unidentified trauma?
You see it in RTAs, when something
like a steering column or a post goes
into a body at great velocity.
But the one thing that could be
ruled out was... Gunshot wound.
Gunshot wound.
Was there, in fact, any part of
your prognosis that was right?
I got that it was a...skeleton.
Yes, you did.
You've just passed the point of...
Where did you train? Where did
you train? DID you train?
Jack, um, do you know
anything about Greek mythology?
Security visa 45895.
Harkness. A little, why?
You ever heard of Philoctetes?
It came up in a pub quiz.
You went to a pub quiz?
Yeah. No, I love pub quizzes.
Down at the Prince of...Tides.
Philoctetes was an archer recruited
to fight in the Trojan War.
He got into an argument and was
marooned on the island of Lemnos for
about ten years. Just left there?
Hey! What's happening
with that list for UNIT?
Hmm?
Oh, yeah. I'm still working on it.
Right.
Well, you know, when you're ready...
Prime Minister, is
this a secure line?
Can you tell me why Torchwood
operations have become part
of your security briefings
to the leader of the Opposition?
This is incredible.
This is THE most incredible
thing I ever heard. They should
make an action figure of you.
You were right, about the pendant.
I see it now -
it can be used for good.
What did they say at work?
How did you explain it?
I didn't tell them.
I think that's wise.
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
have to kiss you now.
Mary, no. Listen!
You do something
unbelievably brave and sexy,
I have to kiss you.
I don't make the rules.
So...
What's happening with the thing
you found on the building site?
Don't know, my boss
is dealing with that.
I thought you did all
the technological stuff.
I do, but sometimes
our jobs overlap a bit.
I'm doing... There's an admin
thing he's asked me to do.
Don't you have a secretary for that?
It's actually quite complicated.
So, what's he found out?
I don't know. He's not said
anything. That's kind of strange.
It isn't, it's fine. No, sure.
I mean, if he's keeping stuff from
you, there's bound to be a reason.
You're not still worrying
about that, are you?
OK, so I'm thinking if it isn't
a gunshot or a musket shot,
or whatever they had then,
maybe it was some kind of ritual.
You are gorgeous!
I start looking into devil-worship
and stuff from that era,
see if there's anything
about plucking out hearts, and would
you believe it? There's nothing.
They ate eyeballs, they drank
blood, they had sex with animals,
but they did not pluck out
each other's hearts. Cos obviously
that would have been weird(!)
Why are you so bothered?
Whoever did this is hardly a threat
to society any more. Yeah, I know.
It's just, there's something...
Does that remind you of anything?
Um..
That bit in Alien where that
thing bursts out of John Hurt?
I'm sorry - I should
have been more specific.
Does that remind
you of anything helpful?
No. Sorry. Right.
Erm, just go over there,
do your computer stuff and
think about shoes, eh?
Thank you.
Has Jack said anything to
you about the hardware we
found with the skeleton?
No, why?
'Check there were
any hospitals nearby.
'Could have been someone died in an
operation. This has sugar in it.'
No worries. Just asking.
Hello. 'Keep looking at the
skeleton, don't look at her.'
'You're grinning...' Hey, Tosh. That
coffee going begging? 'What's the
matter? Why isn't he looking at me?'
There's copies of that Michael
Hamilton statement on your desk.
He's still seeing Cybermen
outside his mother's house.
'Don't think about her palm
on the bottom of my spine,
her hand in my hair.'
I think I'll just go over there.
OK. I'll phone Social Services,
see if there's a history of mental
illness. 'No, Gwen, this is good.
'It can't go on. This is a good
thing. Why the hell isn't he looking
at me?' I think my desk is on fire.
So I've just come from a really
interesting conversation
with a Detective Inspector
Henderson. Right.
Interesting because, firstly,
the man had the biggest
hands I've ever seen,
and secondly...
because of the story he told me
about you saving a woman and her kid
from being murdered
by her ex-husband.
Yeah, no, I was going to tell
you about that. So why didn't you?
I don't know, it wasn't a work
thing, just a...thing thing.
Stuff happens all the time
that's not pertinent to here.
You do this all the time?
So you secretly fight crime,
is that it, Tosh?
I didn't want it
to look like I was showing off.
The guy they arrested, Henderson,
said you heard him muttering
to himself as he was walking along,
and that's what tipped you off.
Mm. I couldn't really work out
what he was saying at first,
and then it was like, "Jesus!"
That's weird because when
I'm about to murder someone,
I'm careful not to talk to myself
about it while I'm in the street.
No, sure. I mean, that's lesson one.
I was wondering how you
were getting on with this.
It's ongoing.
Are you going to dismantle it?
Like I said, it's ongoing.
What? Have I got something
on my face? Is it food?
No. Sorry.
I zoned out. Well, listen, that
was a good save, Tosh. Well done.
OK, so I've got crisps, I've got
coffee - real coffee - wine...
I'm giving them the pendant.
Right, let's... You're right,
it's not like
reading someone's diary.
It's so much worse, and it makes me
feel dirty and ashamed...
And now,
I've been spying on my friends.
Some friends. What's that supposed
to mean? They pity you,
they exclude you!
They've got you doing bloody admin!
So? No. I've made up my mind.
Toshiko, don't do this.
So they'll probably want to
talk to you - why do you care?
It's the pendant they're interested
in, they don't care about you.
I go in that place,
I won't come out again.
What are you talking about?
They're not the Stasi.
Look, I'll get my boss to come here.
DISTORTED: Put the phone down.
OK.
I'll show you.
This is why you can't tell them.
You're cold.
Who are you?
Still the person you kissed.
The person you caressed.
Say something. So...
I'm shagging a woman and an alien.
Which is worse? Well, I know
which one my parents would say.
I read your thoughts.
I didn't see this.
What else are you keeping from me?
You think there could be
anything bigger than this?
The freedom you have.
When I first got here, I found it
almost obscene. My world was savage.
Enforced worship in temples
the size of cities,
execution squads roaming the streets.
Dissent of any kind meant death...
or transportation,
to what they'd call a feral outpost.
And the pendant?
It's how my people communicate.
It's how we've
communicated for centuries.
Speaking orally,
using a pre-arranged and finite
number of words, it's so archaic.
And kind of gross to look at.
The machine you found
is a transporter.
It brought me here, it can
get me home again. I need it
back before you dismantle it.
But won't you be in danger?
200 years have passed.
There'll be a new government.
There'll have been 20 new governments
by now.
Then why hasn't someone come back
for you? I've been forgotten.
Like Philoctetes on Lemnos.
Let me take you to Torchwood.
Maybe we can help you,
fix the transporter,
get you back home. You won't!
You'll examine me, assess whether
or not I'm useful, whether I'm
a danger, then lock me in a cell.
You're not interested in
understanding alien cultures.
It's just as well you haven't
got the technology to
reach other planets yet.
Yours is a culture of invasion.
Do you really think
I'm going to walk,
hands raised in surrender, into that?
'Silence when the door opens. Can't
do another night of the silence...'
'His hands were cold.
'Giving it all, "We'll call Social
Services," over a few bruises?!'
'The whole inheritance is going
on sheltered accommodation...
'Calling it
Grandad's little secret...'
'I can't stand it any more.
'The weight of it. The depravity.'
The fear... It fills me up.
It's in my mouth,
and my hair,
and my eyes. Marmer...
Like I'm drowning in ink.
What am I doing...?
"Heart removed.
"Records and post-mortem passed to
Operation Lowry." Operation Lowry...
And even when I don't
have the pendant on,
even when there's nothing, I can't
forget the things I've seen, the
things I've heard.
Heart removed.
Heart removed. Removed...
How far back does it go?
It's like a curse,
something the gods send
to drive someone mad.
I had hope.
I'd see something,
some little random act of kindness,
and it made me think we were safe,
there was some essential good in us.
This is impossible. But there isn't.
It's like one of the weevils.
You look inside, and there's
just this great yawning scream.
This is completely impossible.
You were right.
Everything you said about us.
We're frightened and
we're callous.
Owen. You need to see this.
And I can't be part of it
any longer. I don't know what to do.
Tell me what to do!
Get me into Torchwood.
"In Xanadu, did Kublai Khan
a stately pleasure-dome decree...
"Where Alph the sacred river ran
through caverns measureless to man,
"down to a sunless sea."
So, where is it, lover? Stay here.
Jack, my boss, has got it.
Be quick.
I've a long journey ahead of me.
I might need something to eat before
I go. This what you're looking for?
Jack! Friend of mine -
let's call him Vincent.
That was his name, after all.
Regular guy, girlfriend,
likes his sport, likes a beer.
He starts acting a little...strange,
a little distracted.
Suddenly he disappears
for a couple of months.
He comes back,
and we've gotta start
calling him Vanessa.
Since then I've always been
a little nervous when a
friend behaves out of character.
I'm sorry,
we haven't been introduced.
Jack Harkness.
My guess is you're not from
around these parts. Now this...
This is incredible. You
know what it is? It's a transporter.
Mary was a political prisoner -
she was exiled here. Look, Jack...
You've got half of it right.
Mary... It is Mary, isn't it?
You want to tell her the
really interesting bit? No?
Chatty, isn't she? I don't know how
you got a word in edgeways, Tosh.
It's a two-man transporter.
Or whatever you people may be.
You might be squids, for all I know.
A two-squid transporter.
Room for one prisoner and one guard.
You want to tell us what
happened to the guard, Mary?
I killed him.
But I was disturbed.
Then another came - a soldier.
He tried to shoot me.
Do whores have prayers?
So I plunged my new human hand into
his chest and plucked out his heart.
And that's what you've
been doing ever since.
This form needs to be fed. All the
punctures were all about the size of
a fist. My God, all those people.
You killed all those people.
I fled before any more soldiers came.
I had so much to explore!
And how I loved this body.
So soft.
So wicked. The power such
a body has in this world.
Within a few years the forest had
gone, transporter was safely buried
under the spread of the city.
I didn't care, I wasn't
exactly in a hurry to get home.
And you've been killing ever since.
I knew there might come a time when
my situation here became complicated,
but I was safe, as long as I
knew where the transporter was.
'The way she looks at you with
those eyes - she's like an animal.'
'When they brought that girl
into the hospital, I had only
been qualified six months.
'I wanted to throw up.'
And then the machine was uncovered.
As soon as the air touched
its surface, I could feel it.
'She's just talking,
she's not even frightened of
us, she's just talking.'
So I found my Toshiko.
My beautiful Toshiko.
'Gonna go for it now.'
Owen, NO! Let her go, Mary!
Let her go! Toshiko,
tell them to give me the transporter.
I can't, Mary.
'It's ridiculous - we're unarmed,
we're just shouting at her.
Not again. Please, God, not again.'
'Knife has incisors on the blade.
It'll tear Tosh's throat out.'
How's this?
I'll exchange Toshiko for that one.
Your choice. 'No, no, not Gwen.'
Just put the knife down. Did you
hear him? He didn't want to, did he?
'She read my thoughts,
she actually read my thoughts.'
'What happened? What did he say?'
Please, don't...
That's what they think of you.
That's who you've been working
with for all these years.
It's not true, Tosh, don't listen.
But not me. Whatever I've done,
it doesn't change the way
I feel about you.
We have a connection, Toshiko,
something real.
'Toshiko... Don't move.
'Don't do anything until I say.'
OK, you want the transporter,
we want Toshiko.
'I've been trained
for this hostage situation...
'For God's sake, think!'
I think that's a fair swap.
Keep the knife and I'll give
you the transporter myself.
'He's just going to let her go.'
It's a bluff,
but I think it's going to work.
You smell...
different to them. That's nothing.
It's when you compare
teeth with a British guy,
that's when it's really scary.
What are you? I don't know.
And you would have put me in a cage?
What's happening? Oh, that.
I re-programmed it for you.
It's set to enable.
Sort of now. What did she...?
Has she gone home?
I reset the co-ordinates.
Where to? To the centre of the sun.
It shouldn't be hot.
I mean, we sent her there at night
and everything. You killed her.
Yes.
Just ask her.
I will, but give me a bit of time.
Say something to her. What do want
me to do? She's been through enough.
It's really creeping me out.
All right!
Owen, don't be selfish about this.
All right!
When did you have this...
I don't know...ability?
Just a couple of days.
What did you hear?
A lot of it was noise. Emotions.
References I wouldn't understand.
Yeah, and the rest?
The rest was none of my business.
No. It wasn't.
I don't know where this leaves us.
Me neither.
We can't really take the
moral high ground over this.
This thing between me and Owen, it...
No, Gwen.
What I did was an invasion.
I wasn't in control, I realise
that now. But even so, I can't...
I have to live with this.
Not what I heard,
but what I did to you.
And my betrayal? What do you mean?
I'm living with mine.
This should be my wake-up call.
I should stop. But I won't.
What does that say about me?
I'm not really in a
position to make judgements.
This is what I'm saying, Tosh.
Neither am I.
Don't let this...
It doesn't matter. Sorry, forget it.
What?
Don't let this put you off.
The last couple of days,
you've had a look about you.
Love suited you.
It's funny.
Such a small thing.
It could be the most powerful piece
of technology we've ever found.
It could tear down governments,
wipe out armies.
What do we do with it?
Your call.
It's a curse.
Why couldn't I read your mind?
I don't know.
Though I could feel you
scrabbling around in there.
I got nothing.
It's like you were...
I don't know...dead.
I want that list for UNIT
on my desk tomorrow, or I'll...
What do bosses do in
situations like these?
Y'know, regular bosses.
Can I get to beat people?
We've got rules for that!
Red tape.
Jack...
Something Mary said...
Probably the only honest
thing she ever did say.
I asked her why she gave it to me.
And she said,
"After a while it gets to you.
"It changes how you see people."
How can I live with it?
There are some things we're
not supposed to know.
You got a snapshot -
nothing more.
I don't mean
about Gwen and Ianto and Owen.
I mean... The whole world...
It doesn't matter.
Now these people are paying the
price, ripped apart
with your name written
in their own blood.
It brings people back to life.
We just question the murder victims.
Uh-oh, we're in trouble.
There's got to be a
link between the victims.
Find the link, find the killer.
It's time Suzie came back. We've
been talking to the wrong corpse.

This programme contains
some violent scenes.
'Torchwood - tracking down
alien life on earth, arming the
human race against the future.
'The 21st century is when everything
changes and you've got to be ready.'
Suzie Costelloe. Why did you
kill those people? The more I used
the glove, the more I control it.
If I could get it to work all
the time, it could resurrect...
I loved this job. I really loved it.
At last. You must be Torchwood?
My team bitch about
you all the time.
And you are? Detective Swanson.
I'm Captain Jack Harkness.
So I've heard. Are you always this
dressy for a murder investigation?
What, d'you rather me naked?
God help me, the stories are true.
So who's the victim?
That's victims, plural.
Yesterday, a man was murdered at
96 Oakham Street, Alex Arwyn, 28,
single, estate agent, here we go,
that's from the scene of crime.
Today, in here, we get two more,
Mark and Sarah Brisco, both 33,
married, he's a surveyor,
she works in education.
What about the smears of blood?
Is that writing?
Work in progress. Come inside
and see the finished thing.
Oh, my God...
Looks like somebody
wants your attention.
They've got it.
We found a few of the killer's
hairs from the first murder.
Lab results should be in soon.
Good, we'll need that.
Now, if you could just clear
the room? Some of this equipment
is strictly need to know.
It was only a matter of time.
What was?
Torchwood walks all over
this city, like you own it.
Now these people are paying
the price - ordinary people,
ripped apart, with your name
written in their own blood.
From where I'm standing, you did
this, Captain Jack Harkness.
You did it.
Still, at least
we've got a head start.
If it's someone we've pissed off,
that narrows it down to...
ooh, four or five million.
And that's just the humans.
Tosh, how we doing?
There's no record of Mr and
Mrs Brisco on our database.
Nor yesterday's victim, and no
link between him and the Briscos.
No connection between any of them.
Jack? They've got the results
on the killer's hair.
Initial findings say,
Caucasian male, early 40s,
smoker, drinks tequila.
Doesn't match any DNA profiles.
Only thing of interest
is a compound we've never
seen before. Recognise it?
Oh, we're in trouble. What is it?
Compound B67.
You're kidding? Retcon.
He's got Retcon in his blood.
B67, aka Retcon, aka the magic
ingredient of the amnesia pill.
And this belongs to us?
This killer is somebody
we gave the amnesia pill to?
Is he remembering
that he's a serial killer?
Or is he becoming a serial killer
because of the Retcon?
Wait a minute. I've taken Retcon.
Then better stay away
from sharp objects.
Ianto, how many people have
we given amnesia pills to?
2,008. Hey, what if they
all become psychotic?!
D'you have to sound so happy?
I'm just saying. Mean Streets!
Tosh, narrow the list
down to fit Swanson's profile,
start checking them out.
You two, there's got to be a link
between the victims, find the link,
find the killer. Get to it!
Jack? If there is a link, why don't
we just ask the victims ourselves?
Not the right time for a seance,
thank you very much. The first time
I met Torchwood, you had that glove.
Heh-heh, no way!
Not after what it did to Suzie.
It brings people back to life. We
could question the murder victims.
That's exactly what she said.
She was one of us, we trusted her
and she's dead cos of that thing.
The glove stays in
the safe where it belongs.
These murders are happening
because of Torchwood.
So Torchwood has got to
do something.
It fell through the Rift
about 40 years ago.
Lay at the bottom of the Bay
till we dredged it up.
I always figured,
this wasn't just lost.
Whoever made it,
wanted rid of it.
You know, we never
gave it a cool name.
I thought we called it
the resurrection gauntlet?
COOL name.
What about the Risen Mitten?
I think it's catchy.
Jack? You OK?
Don't forget, the maximum
resurrection time is two minutes,
and that was only cos Suzie
had practice.
The most we're likely to get
is 30 seconds. Tosh, ready?
Ready.
And, recording.
This man was victim number one.
Name - Alex Arwyn.
Come on, Alex. Come back.
How does it work?
You just sort of feel.
Like reaching into the dark.
Finding the dead.
I can't... I don't...
Ah.
Damn! Ah!
Ah! Nothing!
Sorry.
Never was very good
with this thing. Owen?
I tried last time.
We all had a go, it only responded
to Suzie. Well, I never had a go.
It's cold.
It warms up.
The glove relies on some sort of
empathy. Maybe compassion and...
Just be yourself.
BEEPING
SHE GASPS
Somebody help me!
Oh, my God, help me,
help me, help me! Alex!
I need you to listen to me.
Somebody help! HELP ME!
Alex, you were attacked. Do you
know who it was? Who attacked you!?
Who are you? How long?
- Where am I?
- 15 seconds.
Who are you? I'm trying
to help, sweetheart.
I want my mum.
Please! Let me see my mum...
REPETITIVE BEEPING
FOLLOWED BY PROLONGED BEEP
He's gone. Let me keep trying.
Gwen, he's dead.
I can bring him back. The glove
only works once. I can do it,
let me try. Gwen. Look at me.
He's gone.
That was amazing,
she's a natural. 24 seconds!
Give Ianto a stopwatch, and he's
happy. It's the button on the top.
What d'you think, Gwen?
D'you want to stop?
Recording.
Victim number two - Mark Brisco.
Oh God, I can feel him, it's like a
rope from my heart to the glove...
Oh, it's so warm.
Hey, there. Just look at me.
Look me in the eye. That's it.
(Where am I?)
You've been hurt,
we don't have long, we need
to know who attacked you.
(Is my wife all right?)
We're looking after her.
Now Mark, who was it?
(It was that man. He belonged
to Pilgrim, he went to Pilgrim.)
What's Pilgrim?
(Oh my God, he had a knife.)
No, Mark, he's gone, we don't have
long, quickly, what was his name?
35 seconds.
(Max.) Never knew his surname.
Trying Pilgrim and Max,
get a description.
You gotta give us something more
so we can catch him. He's going.
There was...
There was someone who knew
him better... That woman...
She was always talking to him...
What was her name? Where's my wife?
Her name! Suzie.
REPETITIVE BEEPING FOLLOWED
BY PROLONGED BEEP
One minute five seconds.
Jack? Did I hear that right?
Could be anyone,
Could be anyone,
there must be lots of women called
Suzie. Not connected to this case.
there must be lots of women called
Suzie. Not connected to this case.
We've been talking
to the wrong corpse.
Pilgrim. A religious support group,
more like a debating society,
meaning of life, does God exist?
All that stuff. The point is,
it was tiny, more like a hobby,
run by Mark Brisco's wife, Sarah.
She had all that
stashed in the wardrobe.
Handwritten and photocopied,
that's why we couldn't find any
records, she wasn't even online.
No mention of Suzie, or Max?
Not a word.
She didn't even keep a register.
It wouldn't be our Suzie, though.
She wouldn't go to that support
group bollocks. How do you know?
I mean, were you friends?
Any of you?
Who was her best friend
in this place?
She sort of kept herself to herself.
Well, then.
If she needed to talk, maybe
that's exactly where she'd go,
a group of complete strangers.
Could be. You've got a point, Gwen.
Time we got to know our deceased
colleague a little better.
Have I got this right?
When I die,
you get to keep all my possessions?
My whole life's gonna
get stashed in a locker?
Rules and regulations.
What if I leave all
my stuff to Rhys?
We'll stash him away, too.
Tread carefully, people.
With respect.
This is the life of Suzie Costello.
That's all we are, in the end.
A pile of boxes.
Is her father still alive?
Don't know.
But you must've looked him up?
To tell him his daughter was dead?
When Suzie left Torchwood,
she was on the run.
She wiped all her records.
I couldn't retrieve her files,
she was good at computers.
Huh... She was good at everything.
She was good at murder too.
Laugh a minute, that was Suzie.
What's that?
A book.
Emily Dickinson.
Poet.
Jack.
Pilgrim.
She's part of it.
That proves it, then. No choice.
It's time Suzie came back.
Do we all get frozen?
Torchwood staff, when we die,
do we all get kept?
Rules and regulations.
How long for?
Forever. Recording.
Have you got your stopwatch? Always.
I'll record from my station.
I'm sorry, but I don't want to look
her in the eye. Sorry.
Anyone else?
Any advice?
Yeah, I know. Empathy.
Even though she did try to
kill me. You and me both.
SHE GASPS
I'm getting a reading.
No, it's gone...
SHE BREATHES HEAVILY
Just...memories.
Nothing living. She's too far gone.
What do we do now? Nothing we can do.
That's it.
We're out of options.
There's always the knife.
When she killed all those people,
she always used the knife, it's made
out of the same metal as the glove.
We've seen it before,
metallic resonance.
The glove works better if
the knife's part of the process,
like closing a circuit.
Then let's use it. Small detail.
The knife was used to kill people.
She's already dead.
So we kill her again.
Ianto?
Life knife.
Anything?
No, there was just a sort of
spark and then it was gone.
I'm sorry, Jack.
You're gonna have do it properly.
What the hell.
SUZIE AND GWEN GASP
Suzie? I've gotta go!
I can't stay, they know.
Just look at where you are.
Think back, try to remember...
Suzie! Suzie! Look at me!
Jack. Oh, my God.
There's a knife in my chest,
did you kill me?
You killed yourself, remember?
But... Oh my God, I shot myself.
We've got to ask you about Pilgrim.
No. Wait a minute.
Didn't I kill you?
Never mind that,
we need names and details.
Who's using the glove? I'm sorry.
Oh, wouldn't you know it,
Gwen bloody Cooper. 30 seconds.
When you were in Pilgrim
you gave the amnesia pill to
a man, Max, do you remember?
What? You brought me all
the way back, just for Max?!
We need to find him. Who is he?
What's his surname?
He was...
some loser... We're losing her!
Stay here. Damn you!
Don't force it, Gwen. She's not
getting away this time, stay here!
No! I told you to stop!
It's all right, I've got her,
I've got her...
Hold on... OK, pulse. She's all
right. We need to get her out of
here. Can you give me a hand?
It's the glove,
I told you they get hooked.
All right, don't make
a fuss, it's over now.
Um, excuse me. I'm still counting.
There's not much point, she's dead.
No, according to the
equipment, she's unconscious.
What the hell's going on?
Oh, my God. He's right.
She's alive! Suzie's still alive.
Look at her, she's bloody breathing!
She can't be...
Nope.
Still breathing.
No stopping her. She won't die.
One minute thirty and counting.
MACHINE BEEPS
How long's it been?
Three months.
When can I die?
I just want to go.
Can't you leave me alone?
You seem to be stuck.
But...
Am I gonna stay like this?
For how long?
Don't know.
Can I see my father? No.
You wiped your records.
We had no trace of him.
So, he doesn't even know that I'm
dead? Well, you're not any more.
This is sick.
You started it.
Right now, we've got an
investigation underway.
Pilgrim.
You visited these Pilgrim meetings
and gave an amnesia pill to someone
called Max. How do we find him?
What for? What did he do?
He was just an ordinary bloke.
We think the Retcon
triggered a psychosis.
He's started killing.
How many victims? Three. Same as you.
We need to know, how much
Retcon did you give him?
Owen. Hello.
Scared to face me?
(SIGHS) You frighten
the shit out of me, yeah.
What about Toshiko?
Is she still here?
Yeah, she's here.
All the gang. Happy days.
But the amnesia pills,
how many did you give him?
One a week. Every week.
For two years.
Christ! No wonder.
What the hell did you do that for?
I just...
I wanted someone to talk to.
About this place.
It was driving me mad.
And he was just...
He listened, that's all, he listened.
Every week, as soon as I'd finished
talking, I'd give him the pill.
You overdosed him.
I didn't know that!
Keep getting it wrong, don't I?
Is that why you brought me back? Did
you think I wasn't guilty enough?
What was his surname? I don't know.
All I ever did was talk about me.
It's all my fault, isn't it?
Never bloody stops being my fault.
Can't you just let me die?
You don't get off that easy.
Yeah, you did warn me,
right at the beginning.
He said, "This is the one
job you can never quit."
Then let's get to work.
Come on, Suzie!
Just like the old days.
There's gotta be something.
Hold on... There's someone missing.
This girl came every week,
student, blonde...
She's not in these photos.
Who was she? Lucy.
Lucy Mackenzie.
Said she worked at a club.
Which one?
Uhhh...
Come on, Suzie?
Which club?
For God's sake, this Max is killing
every single member of Pilgrim.
Now tell me, Lucy Mackenzie,
where did she work, which club?!
Wolf.
The Wolf Bar.
POUNDING ROCK MUSIC
Cover the exits.
Bloody hell, like I didn't have
a banging headache already.
That's the glove, Gwen.
Gets inside your mind.
Yeah, all right Suzie, stop
creeping me out. Just tell us, any
sign of Max or this Lucy Mackenzie?
Nothing yet. Keep moving round.
Keep alert, people.
To repeat, Max is described as 40,
six-three, six-four, stocky, short
dark hair, tattoo down his left arm.
That narrows it down.
Can't even look at me, can you?
It's not like you
to be so judgemental.
Not like you to go
on a murder spree.
All right, so it
drives us mad, this job.
God knows, I've done
some stupid stuff.
But now, I've got to keep
on working, every day,
in a job that's got a bit
less honour, because of you.
Wait, I've got a match on that guy.
Where is he?
Northwest Bar. Show me.
Owen, get in closer,
which one do you mean?
Wait, he's going over for the...
Wait, I've got a match on our
girl, Lucy Mackenzie, the student.
That's her, that's definitely her.
It's too late, he's going over.
Got the bastard!
That isn't him.
Gwen! Behind you!
That's one for Ianto.
Risen mitten, life knife
and that old classic,
stun gun. Come on, let's get him
out of here. You saved my life.
Maybe I came back for a reason.
SIRENS WAIL
OK, so your name is Max Tresillian,
can you confirm that?
You live at 106 Endeavour
Terrace, is that right?
Parents, Sandra and Dave, yeah?
You're inside the
Torchwood facility.
GROWLS
And five, six...
Keep watching.
Soon as we reach ten...
Just stops dead.
If this is a drug-induced psychosis,
it's a very specific one.
Like he reacts to
the word Torchwood.
Thanks, Jack.
Sorry.
But if that's caused by
Retcon, we've got a million
more problems on the way.
Let me know what the scan says.
But, what about Suzie?
What are you gonna do with her?
No idea.
What do you think?
You're the boss.
Torchwood!
GROWLS
Can't you ask Jack?
Just one favour?
I want to see my father.
Tell us where he is,
we could bring him in.
I'm not letting him
anywhere near Torchwood.
If he's still alive.
What's wrong with him?
Cancer.
All that waiting, and
then I go and die first.
I could contact him on your behalf.
And say what?
So, tell me. Since I've been gone,
you enjoying it?
Yes. Well, you know,
this place is sort of...
It's mad, isn't it? Insane.
Bloody nuts. Best job I ever had.
Me too. And the worst.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Funny thing is, you always
imagine when you're dead,
they're gonna miss me at work.
Indispensable!
But look what happened.
I got replaced...
..by someone better.
You got that glove working,
better than I did. Just got lucky.
No, it's more than that.
The others, they prefer you.
Don't say that.
You got my job.
Almost like you planned it.
Except I didn't.
And I'm sorry, but I've got
my own function at Torchwood
and I'm a lot more
than just a replacement.
Have you slept with Owen?
There you go,
replaced me completely.
I had a boyfriend who used
to walk into rooms like that.
The grand entrance.
It got kind of boring.
Although, he was one of twins, so
I put up with it. Twin acrobats.
Man, I gotta write that book.
Maybe even illustrate it. I can talk
for a long time, a very long time.
Takes me a while to piece
things together. Meaning?
Suzie had the glove.
You put her in charge of it.
But tell me, Jack, did you
ever ask about her father? How do
you mean? He's got cancer.
He's been dying
slowly now for years.
And what do you do? You give
his daughter the one device that
brings people back to life!
Is it any wonder she got
obsessed? Oh, so is this all
my fault?! Well, isn't it?
Did you ever stop and think?
Did you...
Did you ever look at Suzie?
Did you ever...
think what that glove
would do to her, did you?
Right from the start,
you thought that Suzie's
death was because of you,
Cos it happened when you arrived.
Then you brought her back
to life, all the way,
because you wanted it so much. OK!
We're both responsible!
Now, what the hell are we going
to do with her?! I don't know.
What if she never dies?
Have you thought of that? Like...
Undying, forever. Just you and her.
No way. Could be.
I wouldn't wish that on her.
I'd sooner kill her right now.
Could you, though? Kill her?
Yeah. Really? Oh, yeah.
'Jack, can you come to the
conference room? Something I need
you to see. Kind of urgent.'
I was going over Suzie
and Gwen's medical records.
I ran them through the filter.
Watch the footage.
This is the moment when Gwen brought
back Mark Brisco, the husband.
See?
Now look at his death. See?
The energy flow stops
just as he's about to die. But...
have a look at Gwen with Suzie.
Whoa.
What is that?
Energy.
Life.
But with Suzie, it's a permanent
connection and she's getting
stronger. It's still going, now.
She's draining the life out of Gwen.
There's always a price.
More coffee? Is that all you do?
Just leave me alone.
Have a biscuit, at least.
Go on.
Just for me.
The wearer of the glove
can bring somebody back, but
loses their own life in return.
How do we stop it?
We've got to kill her.
Suzie's got to die.
Again. Who's gonna do it?
Like you said.
I'm the boss.
Toshiko! Where the hell's Suzie?
And where's Gwen?
Interrogation Room.
No they're not... Find them, fast!
I can't see them.
Hold on. Scanning. Nope.
Nothing on internal scans.
What's going on, where've they
gone? Just keep looking... Bring
up the SUV. Still there.
I'll try exteriors...
What about Gwen's car?
What's she doing?
Getting herself fired.
Unbelievable. How stupid is that?
Thinking she could just drive off.
Come on. Let's go get them.
What the hell...
Ianto?
Ianto? Captain!
What happened?
I thought you must've done it.
We've gone into lockdown.
Then reverse it! I can't.
It's 100%.
The doors are sealed.
We're locked in! I'm taking you
to see your dad and that's it, OK?
Sorry.
I must be mad.
Jack's not stupid.
He's gonna catch us.
Oh, you never know.
We might get lucky.
Everything's gone. Computers,
mobile coverage, the lifts,
everything... We're sealed in.
How long does Gwen have
before she dies? Two hours,
maybe less. Come on! Think!
If Suzie set up the lockdown, how
did she do it? Entered an override?
She's officially dead,
she wouldn't get access.
Then how did she do it?
What the hell did she do?!
There's got to be an answer.
Suzie couldn't physically
start the lockdown,
Gwen wouldn't have let her.
But there's no-one else! Wait
a minute... We've got a guest.
..Stopped for me
The carriage held but just
ourselves and immortality
Because I could not stop
for death... Is that a poem?
I wonder. Emily Dickinson?
But what does it mean?
It's a verbal trigger.
Say it out loud, maybe repeat it 100
times over and the Hub locks down.
But if that's part of the system,
Suzie must've installed a vocal
command programme, way back.
Back when she was alive, yeah.
Max is just a Trojan horse. Suzie
planned this right from the start.
'Do you see? Max, the Retcon,
everything, it's all been a hoax
to get us to resurrect Suzie.'
She gave Max a whole complex
of subconscious triggers.
Like, she dies,
Max becomes a time bomb...
He doesn't see her for three months
and, wham, the orders kick in.
He follows Suzie's program,
and starts killing.
And the whole chain of events
forces us to bring Suzie back.
And then she escapes! That is not
bad! I'm picking her for my team.
If she could lockdown the Hub,
she must've installed
a way of reversing it.
A bit more colour in your cheeks.
It's all thanks to you.
That night...
my last night on Earth,
or so I thought...
..before I shot myself, I shot
Jack right through the head.
I killed him, stone dead and
then he just stood up and lived.
Am I right? Did that happen?
Gwen? Yes, it did.
So he can survive a bullet
through the head? Yeah. How?
I don't know.
He won't explain it properly.
Said something happened
to him a while back. He said...
He said he can't die.
Not ever.
And he makes judgments about
whether I'm allowed to live.
It's all very easy for
Captain Jack, isn't it?
Do you ever wonder? What?
Who is he?
All the time.
DIALLING TONE
I've got reception, sir.
How do you do that?
We're sealed off! Just used
the Water Tower as a relay.
Nice work, Ianto!
But who the hell do we phone?!
PHONE RINGS
Detective Swanson.
Who is it? Torchwood.
You'd better not be wasting my time.
I was wondering if you could
do us a favour. The humble police,
helping the mighty Torchwood?
Why don't you just help
yourselves? Like you normally do.
Because we can't. Why's that?
Why don't you just help
yourselves? Like you normally do.
Because we can't. Why's that?
We're sort of busy.
Well, I'm busy too,
try someone else. No, no, no...
It's just because we can't at the
moment because we're sort of stuck.
In what way? We're locked in.
You're locked in?
Just a bit. Locked in where?
Um. In our own base.
You're locked inside your own base?
And it's not funny.
And how am I supposed to help you,
exactly? We need a book of poetry.
'It's NOT funny!'
Oh, God, driving at night...
GWEN SWITCHES RADIO ON
# Just a little... #
Oh, my God.
I don't know this one.
It's ancient.
My Mum used to sing this,
when I was a kid.
All those years ago...
# O-o-o-oh, soleil, soleil... #
..before I died.
# Soleil, soleil
# Soleil, soleil
# O-o-o-oh, soleil, soleil... #
All right, Captain Jack,
just say that one more time.
Nice and clear.
LOUDSPEAKER: We're locked in our
own base and we can't get out.
LAUGHTER
OK, you've had your fun.
Listen, Detective Swanson,
one of our team is in danger.
Right, you lot, back to work...
OK, we've got it.
The Complete Poems,
it's gonna cost you 20 quid.
What does the book say? Er, I don't
know, what am I supposed to do?!
Find I Could Not Stop For Death.
Read out the next verse.
What if it doesn't work?
Read out the whole book.
It's gonna be a long night.
Tired?
I'm fine.
Don't want you falling
asleep at the wheel.
One corpse is enough for this
car, thanks. Don't say that.
What? Corpse. Cos you're not.
What am I, then?
I dunno, you're just not, though.
When you're dead...
I mean, when you die...
What happens?
What do you want me to say?
The truth. Really?
Tell me.
You religious? Just sort of
in passing, you know.
Do you believe in Heaven? I dunno.
Yes, you do. What do you believe?
Stupid, but I always
sort of think...
Like, you know,
white light and all that.
And I think of my Gran.
Like she'll be there.
Waiting for me.
The smell of carbolic.
Your faith never left primary school.
So what's out there?
Nothing.
Just nothing.
But, if there's nothing,
what's the point of it all?
This is.
Driving through the dark.
All this stupid, tiny stuff.
We're just animals,
howling in the night,
cos it's better than silence.
I used to think about Torchwood,
all those aliens, coming to Earth...
What the hell for?
But it's just instinct.
They come here cos
there's life, that's all.
Moths around a flame.
Creatures clinging
together in the cold.
So when you die, it's just...
Darkness.
And you're all alone?
There's no-one else?
I didn't say that. What do you mean?
Why do you think I'm so
desperate to come back?
There's something out there...
in the dark...
..and it's moving.
Parting is all we know of
heaven and all we need of hell.
No, try another.
Success is counted sweetest
by those who ne'er succeed.
Christ, she was a bundle of laughs.
Success is counted sweetest by
those who ne'er succeed. Nope.
Wait a minute, just had a thought...
If words cause the lockdown,
maybe numbers reverse it...
Try the ISBN, every book's
got a different number.
You getting this? Yup, hang on,
I'm looking... Read it out.
The keyboards aren't working. The
membrane might recognise the code.
OK. Got it!
ISBN 019 8600 585.
That's it! Everybody,
move, move! Cathy, thank you.
Pleasure!
I've got the tracker on
Gwen's car. It's a hospital.
Giving you the co-ordinates now.
On the way. How long's she got?
It's only a guess, but I'd give
Gwen about 40 minutes.
Kathy, I want the road
ahead clear. I'm gonna break
the speed limit, big time.
All units, give Torchwood priority,
repeat, give Torchwood priority.
MACHINE BEEPS
Suzie... I don't, em... I'm not...
Oh, my God, this headache, it's...
What's happening to me?
I'm sorry, Gwen.
You're getting shot in the head.
Slowly.
And believe me, it hurts.
Almost better.
Completely gone, soon.
No!
No, no, no...
Dad?
GWEN CRIES
It's me, Dad.
Wake up!
Dad? It's Suzie.
Hello, Dad.
Ow!
And goodbye.
What are you doing?
BEEPING
Oh, that's worth coming back for.
Sending him into the dark.
Just what the bastard deserves.
They're moving again. Can't predict
a specific destination, not yet.
Keep feeding it through,
we're catching up.
PHONE RINGS
Hello?
Did you like the poem, Jack?
Suzie, don't let her die.
The glove is killing Gwen
and keeping you alive. I know.
Then stop. But I get to live.
Why would I stop? For Gwen's sake.
She replaced me.
Now, I'm doing the same
to her. Isn't that fair?
Suzie, we've got a tracker
on that car, we're gonna
catch up, I promise.
And what happens then?
If she's dead, then I'm gonna
kill you, Suzie Costello.
I promise, I'm gonna kill you
for the last and final time.
But would you?
When there's a part of her
that's now me?
Could you really do that
if I'm the only thing left of her?
Why are you doing this?
Because life is all, Jack.
You should know.
I'd do anything to stay.
Anything.
Suzie. Please. Just stop.
She's a real find, this one.
Gwen Cooper.
She's better than me.
She's so much better.
I was never any good.
Jack, I'm sorry.
SUZIE!
Jack, she's heading for
the coast line on the B587.
It's a place called Hedley Point,
there's some sort of ferry, goes
out to the islands. Get a move on.
Owen, how long we got?
Minutes.
It's beautiful, Gwen.
Can you see?
We'll take the ferry.
Go out. As far as we can.
Keep on running
cos he won't hurt us.
We'll keep on going, you and me...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Have you gone? Gwen?
Can you hear me? Gwen?
Poor Gwen Cooper.
Safe journey.
Let her go.
I can't.
Let Gwen go. I can't.
Owen, how is she?
Owen! Report!
I think we're too late.
If I kill you, does she live?
But you can't, Jack.
Cos look at me.
I'm the last thing left of
Gwen Cooper, can't you see it?
Just the smallest bit of her?
Not one bit.
Owen? Anything?
Nothing. But I broke the connection.
I killed you. Can't die.
Never gonna die.
How much more of this do you want?
It's all your fault, Jack.
You recruited me.
The glove. Tosh! Destroy the glove!
It's keeping them connected!
Ianto, armaments, code five.
Captain, my captain.
Do you want to know a secret?
There's something moving in the dark
and it's coming,
Jack Harkness.
It's coming for you.
Whoah! Whoah! It's OK.
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.
SIRENS WAIL
# If I should die this very moment
# I wouldn't fear
# For I have never
known completeness
# Like being here
# Wrapped in the warmth of you
# Loving every breath of you
# Still my heart, this moment
# Or it might burst
# Could we stay right here
till the end of time?
# Till the earth stops turning?
# Wanna love you
till the seas run dry
# I found the one
I've waited for. #
Thanks for doing this.
Part of my job, sir.
No, I should be doing it, but...
One day, we're going
to run out of space...
If you're interested...
I've still got that stopwatch.
So?
Well. Well, think about it.
Lots of things you can do
with a stopwatch.
Oh, yeah.
I can think of a few.
There's quite a list.
I'll send the others home early.
See you in my office in ten.
That's ten minutes and counting.
Oh, Jack?
What do you want me to say
on the death certificate?
Good question.
She had quite a few
deaths in the end.
I don't know.
Death by Torchwood.
I'll put a lock on the door,
just in case she goes walking again.
Nah, no chance of that.
The resurrection days are over,
thank God.
Oh, I wouldn't be too sure.
That's the thing about gloves, sir.
They come in pairs.

Torchwood, outside the Government,
beyond the Police.
Tracking down alien life on Earth,
arming the human race
against the future.
The 21st century
is when everything changes.
And you've got to be ready.
This programme contains
some strong language.
The speed of light is
299,792,458 metres per second.
Pain travels through the body
at 350 feet per second.
Even a sneeze can reach 100mph.
And as for life,
well, that just bloody whizzes by.
So then, this is me,
Eugene Jones.
Hey, Gwen. Jack! Er, Tosh...
The guys at the rope
just let me through so...
I'd say at least 50 miles per hour.
Travelled on the bonnet, bounced,
maybe rolled, smashed his face
on the road.
Hey? Um, excuse me,
but that looks a lot like me.
He couldn't even cross the road
without messing it up.
No bag - nothing.
I mean, what was he doing here?
Perhaps he was hit deliberately...
Maybe he really did have
something important. Like what?
I don't know. He was always trying
to talk to us, show us stuff.
Perhaps we shouldn't have been so...
Gwen, I think it's just
an ordinary RTA. Guys?
It was a red car. There's red paint
under his fingernails. Am I dead?
Am I dead?
Am I dead?
PHONE RINGS
Yes? Hello, love. I've just been
to the shops and forgot tea-bags.
Hello...?
Eugene? Hi, Mrs Jones.
Something's happened.
We need to talk to you.
What happened? How did I end up here?
I mean, I'm dead, but I'm not dead.
So... Shit!
So, what? Am I a ghost or a zombie?
Oh, God. Right, calm.
Yeah? Stick with the team.
What? You're driving.
This is Torchwood,
it's going to be OK.
Oh, what?! Of course, I'm invisible.
Why am I invisible?
Anything on his phone from today?
Just some pictures of random shoes.
Mind you, it feels kinda familiar.
You know what, whatever's happened,
all of a sudden, I'm somewhere
I've always wanted to be.
Let's back up a bit.
I mean, every story's got a
beginning. I think mine began here...
The final of the Interschool
Maths Competition, 1992.
I used to be a maths head.
Binary coding, topology, quadratics,
I loved stuff like that.
And I'm supposed to be
really good at it.
And Rushmore, a mountainous 42...
So we congratulate
the winning team - Rushmore...
Dad took the day off work to come and
see me, but when the moment mattered,
I blanked,
let the side down,
made a mess of it.
Everyone blamed me
for losing the final...
..but it must have been
what happened afterwards
that started this whole thing off.
Have you ever had a proper look
at the collection? No, sir.
Would you like to? No, sir.
I play golf.
Oh. Good, sir.
I play golf. And one day when
I was playing really badly...
I was stuck in the first bunker
whacking away at all the sand...
..and this fell out of the sky,
and landed - plop! - beside me.
From the sky? Yeah.
It looks a bit like a golf ball,
so I picked it up
and put it in my pocket.
But when I had a proper look
later... Here.
I realised it was an eye.
And I thought, well,
"Where could that have come from?"
It fell from the sky.
Isn't that amazing?
Have it.
Where the bloody hell
have you been?!
Good evening. ..Good evening.
Come on, Eugene.
Have you got everything?
Yes. Thanks, sir.
I went to the school, didn't I!
'Dad was mad at me
for losing the final.
'But now I had the eye.
'And what I realised was, if it fell
from the sky, it probably...'
No... No, it almost certainly
belonged to an alien.
HIS MUM AND DAD ARGUE
DOOR SLAMS
That was the night Dad went away.
But it was OK, because I had the eye,
and the possibility
of an alien encounter.
I mean, if you leave something
really important behind,
you come back and get it.
Don't you?
I wanted that alien to come back
and claim his eye more than
I wanted anything in my life.
I worked out the possible provenance,
the life form and galaxy,
planetary escape velocities,
launch windows,
necessary fuel capacities,
and then, I waited.
# There's a star man
waiting in the sky
# He'd like to come and meet us
but he thinks he'll blow our minds
# There's a star man
waiting in the sky
# He's told us not to... #
My dad never came back.
As I got older, I became interested
in UFOs, collected alien artefacts,
watched the stars
and waited alone for my alien.
'And then,
'I found you, Gwen Cooper.'
Hi, I'm Eugene Jones
and, er, I have a keen interest
in your work and, er...
I've got something to...
I'd just like to show... Hi.
Hi. OK, what it is...
Look, I've got to go.
'But I couldn't quite make contact.'
Hmm, you again.
Gwen, I've got this thing
I really need to show you.
Sorry, that sounded...
'I couldn't get you interested in
the eye, no matter how hard I tried.'
Are you sure it's my Eugene?
Yes, Mrs Jones.
Perhaps
you couldn't really identify him.
We could.
That's his tea there.
Shit!
What are we doing here?
Look at this.
Do you understand what's happened
to your brother, Terry? Yeah. What?
He walked into a road
and got run over.
Where's your dad? He works for a big
corporation in America.
Gwen?
That's pre-Gorgon Pilurian currency.
I had them authenticated.
Are these Roman coins?
Hey, look, Rice Krispies. Man,
there are some rogues out there.
Oh, hang on,
there's something missing here.
Mrs Jones, do you know what's
missing from Eugene's collection?
Why didn't they stop?
They killed my boy
and just drove on...
Excuse me.
I am sorry, Mrs Jones.
Look, Mum, I'm sorry,
but we've got the best team ever
working on this. Torchwood, me - top!
We'll get it sorted, Mum.
See, I think
there's probably been some mistake.
So... So...
I gotta go.
I want to know what he last ate,
where he'd been...
Oh, wow!
This is... This is...
I am totally...
Christ almighty!
The Head of Vexor 11.
No way!
And... Wow!
A hand... In a jar.
What was he doing out on that road?
Fuck knows. Categorising chevrons.
He was a geek.
Ah, this is truly legendary.
Gwen, he had a bit of a thing about
you, and now you're feeling guilty.
Sod off, Owen.
You do it, then.
I do it? The autopsy?
Yes. I've got a stack of admin.
OK. Good. You're sure? Yes.
Really? Yes.
I am in heaven.
Am I?
Is that...?
Number three scalpel.
Start at the sternum. Piece of piss.
OK, here we go.
This is also new to me, but
in an investigation like this...
OK, a red Vauxhall has been stopped
outside Caernarfon.
Very drunk guy has admitted
knocking a man over near Cardiff.
Fit's Eugene's description.
The man says he thought he'd be OK,
so he drove on. Ah, he was
a sweet guy. That's very sad.
Now, can we get on
with some proper work, please?
# Hope there's someone
who'll take care of me
# When I die
# Will I go?
# Hope there's someone
who'll set my heart free
# Nice to hold when I'm tired
# There's a ghost on the horizon
# When I go to bed
# How can I fall asleep at night?
# How will I rest my head?
# I'm scared of the middle place
# Or paralyse in light
# And godsend I don't want to go... #
Do you think Eugene
committed suicide?
It was a road accident
and there was no alien involved.
See, I'm not so sure because
something seems really odd.
I mean, I just...
I just feel that
there's something going on.
Marvellous.
Thank you for that Disney moment.
Now, who's making the tea?
I suppose Eugene's a bit odd and
a real local and amateur for you.
Why is it that only Gwen seems to
have a heart? I don't know if you've
noticed but the rest of us are human
and amazingly we still manage to
get on with our jobs. OK, you two...
OK, fine. Leave it, forget it.
I have.
Is that Eugene's DVD?
No.
Yes!
It was on loan from a video store.
You were nicking his stuff?
I was going to take it back.
I'll do it. Suits me.
There'll be a fine.
I'm going to go for some lunch.
All right.
Hi. Do you know when the video shop
round the corner opens?
No, he's a law unto himself.
Gwen! What are you doing here?
This is my lunch cafe. This is...
Do you know someone
called Eugene Jones?
That's me! That's me. Middle height.
Sandy hair. Ordinary looking...
Nope. What can I do for you?
I come in here every day.
Two eggs, ham and chips.
Two eggs, ham and chips, please.
So...
So...
Wow, this is so weird.
I used to follow YOU around.
Now you're following me!
Yeah.
No, you see,
I don't know whose those are.
I can't remember anything, except...
Phone Gary. He might know something.
Phone Gary, phone Gary...
'Hi, this is Gary.
Please leave a message.'
Hi, my name is Gwen Cooper. I have
some very bad news for you, Gary.
I'll give you a call back later.
That is so beautiful.
TV: These ancient creatures have had
their day.
All over these lush fern prairies
a grim evolutionary battle
has broken out
among the newer types of reptile...
Hello.
Hi, gorgeous. Want to borrow
a dream? No, thank you.
I want to return some DVDs on
behalf of someone who's deceased.
Deceased? No shit.
That's pretty final. Eugene Jones.
Hey, I think he used
to come in here, with a mate.
Bit of a dreamer, kind of...
Irresistible?
Ordinary looking. Yeah.
He was killed in a road accident.
That's bad. Sweet guy.
£34, please. £34?!
Yeah. Sorry. He's had 'em out ages.
I haven't seen him in months.
I don't think I can bend the rules,
just cos he's dead.
Bread-head bastard. Sorry, Gwen.
That's OK.
Did he, er...?
Did he walk
into the oncoming traffic?
See, lot a people come in here.
They don't want to be themselves any
more, they want to be someone else.
They want me to transport them.
How about you, baby? Oh, leave
it out. I'm fine, thank you.
How about you? Me?
I'm outta here.
Moving to London in a couple of
months. You know what I'm sayin'?
You see, no disrespect, but Eugene
had "loser" written through him
like "Brighton" in a stick of rock.
Maybe he just couldn't live
with his...failure.
You wanna write a cheque?
Failure?
Is that right? Has my life
just been one big failure?
I mean, maybe I never quite lived up
to my early promises of maths genius,
but that's because I was waiting
for the alien to collect his eye
and change my life.
And while I was waiting,
I joined Passmore Telesales.
Oh, yes.
This is all nauseatingly familiar.
'Selling kitchens, home insurance,
barbeque sets.
'Selling life and...still waiting.'
Jason!
Kevin! The guy
with the personal hygiene problem.
Nothing changes, really.
Hi, Morag.
Me and Morag used to go out.
So, how come I can remember the
details of my fascinating daily life,
but the vital couple of weeks
before I died
are still a complete mystery to me?
Are you Gary?
Yeah, yeah. How do you, er...?
Are you... Gwen, yes.
I was just wondering whether
you saw Eugene the day he died.
No. Sorry.
Just doing a card. You know...
"Good luck in your new job"?!
He's dead. No! Who's it for, then?
His mum, you idiot! Shit.
Can you rub it out? It's in Biro.
People just don't understand.
Don't worry, mate, it's OK.
Is it true?
He got run over? Yeah.
Oh, God.
Sorry. I'm Linda.
I'm a Silver Seller.
It's all about belief, see?
If necessary,
I am Kitchens For A Lifetime.
Eugene was only ever himself.
He wasn't the best salesman then?
No. I think Craig kept him on
out of the goodness of his heart.
Have you met Craig? Is he your boss?
Are you two an item?
A snog in the ladies'
at the Christmas party.
But I can't talk about it here cos
of Craig's, you know...position.
Do you want to meet lunchtime
for a chat?
OK. Where does Gary sit?
Number 50. OK, thank you. Thanks.
MOBILE RINGS
Owen. 'Gwen, Jack wants to know
where you are.' Yeah, sorry.
I had a few things to sort out.
I'll be back later.
'Yeah, well, make it quick.'
Well, one day Eugene came in,
very low. Why? Why was he low?
He wouldn't talk about it.
Anyway, I was fed up too
because Craig had...
Well, anyway, I said,
I'd love to get away from it all
and go to Australia.
Eugene suddenly got very excited.
He said, "Yes! You've got to go."
I said,
"But I haven't got the money,"
and he said he'd get it for me.
So he was going to pay for a ticket
for you to go to Australia with him?
Was he in love with you?
Oh, no! He loved someone
he said was unattainable.
He was just trying to look after me.
He said,
"Don't stay here
and waste your life waiting for
something that may never happen."
Where was he going to get
the money from? Exactly.
You said, "You haven't bought socks
in six years."
I said, "You haven't even had
a new pair of socks in six years."
He stood up, and he said...
MOBILE RINGS
That's your phone.
Yeah, he said...? He said,
"I'm going to sell it."
I said, "What?"
He said, "My alien artefact." So...?
So...? So he brought it in to work.
It's a plastic eye!
It's an alien body part,
and I'm going to sell it on eBay.
Eugene, it's very nice of you,
but I don't think that's going
to get me the bus into town,
let alone a flight to Sydney.
Some people laughed.
But he went ahead,
and of course, it just sat there.
She said maybe a photo,
a bit more of a description...
Then, out of the blue - £2.50.
A kid from Birmingham.
And then...
Eugene, you got a couple more bids.
Bloody hell! 75 quid!
That was just the beginning.
200... 300...
1,000... They just kept on going up.
£3,000! For a spare body part.
Pete said you can get
a bathroom suite with a celebrity
appearance for less than that!
Then one day, it just...
jumped.
Oh, my God, Eugene, you're rich!
£15,005.50.
Who bought it? Who bought it?
I've no idea. Is it all my fault?
Of course it's not!
MOBILE RINGS
I'm sorry.
Hello? 'Hi, it's Eugene's mum.'
Mrs Jones? 'There's something
I think you should see.'
OK. I'll come over.
That was Eugene's mum.
Sorry, I'm going to have to go.
I'm sorry.
MAN: There he is...my son at the
Interschool Maths Final. Big moment.
Youngest contestant in Wales.
So, it's down to the wire, the
last question will settle the final.
What curve is represented by
y-squared = 4ax?
Come on. You got a brain the
size of Cardiff Arms Park!
What's the friggin' problem?!
What curve is represented by
y-squared = 4ax? Don't do this.
Don't let me down, boy.
No?
DING!
Time's up. No additional points.
The final scores are...
I don't understand. Someone gave him
the eye as a consolation prize?
Yeah, it was that Mr Garrett,
the science teacher.
A plastic eye!
As a consolation prize!
Still, Eugene treasured it.
That was the night Dad walked out.
Went away.
You can stop now, Mum.
What do you mean? He's dead.
He may have been able to square
the root of the square root, but he
couldn't cross the road! Terry!
He sold the eye online.
So something must have happened.
Dad left when he found out Eugene
was a failure. That's what Eugene
said. None of that's true.
He went cos of his job.
He has a very important job.
Does Mr Jones know about Eugene?
Well, you see, he works for
a big corporation
in America. Stop giving us that shit!
He's not Superman, Mum! He works at
a garage on Filey Road.
Eugene found him about two weeks
ago. He found him on the internet.
He's a cashier. Works nights.
Oh, God, now I remember
why I sold the eye.
Life can be such a let down,
can't it?
All those years I'd believed
my dad had gone to America
because I was a failure.
And here he was, all along,
doing his important secret
work in Filey Road, Cardiff.
When I found him,
I couldn't even bear to say hello.
I'd spent my life believing
in stupid stories, fantasies.
I've wasted my life.
Once I'd seen him there, everything
I'd dreamed about was like rubbish,
just a crock of shit,
including the eye.
So why not sell it?
Along with the woodworm
treatment and loft insulation,
and all the other crap floating
round the world.
Linda was welcome to the money.
No! No! NO! Don't, Gwen!
I don't want anything to do with him.
I'm sorry.
It's OK.
You turned your phone off.
It was Eugene.
He didn't understand
why his father left.
He just needs a bit of help.
To do what? He's dead!
Yes, Jack, I know he's dead, but...
This is not sounding good, Gwen.
I've got work to do. OK.
Eh? No. You can't just stop.
I mean, what about the £15,000?
Gwen? Gwen! OK. Listen to this.
Eugene had an alien eye in his
collection. He sold it online.
What, like a sixth eye?
A Dogon sixth eye?
Maybe.
It's possible.
There was a trade in them.
Who's got it? I don't know, but
I've nearly tracked it down.
What exactly is a sixth eye?
I mean, exactly?
It's one in the back. Let's you
see behind you, where you've been.
Kind of puts things in perspective.
It's useful,
fun, slightly terrifying,
that's why they were in demand.
See? See? I told you.
I can get it for you.
My alien...
See? See?
OK, you've got the weekend.
But keep your phone on.
God, you are brilliant.
And I'm brilliant too.
Oh, yeah, of course,
Gary and me were going to go to
that talk in Aberystwyth.
Black holes and anti-matter were
pretty important to me and Gary, but
if I'm going to spend a night by the
sea, I know who I'd rather be with.
I'd trust you with my life
if, you know, I still had one.
Gary?
I'm not proud of what I've done.
You hiked the bid? I created
three or four online aliases,
and used them to inflate the price.
But why?
At first, just to cheer him up.
He was miserable.
But then the bidding
took off and we got...
I mean, I was involved at first.
I was just helping Eugene make money,
and then one morning...
Gary!
Gary, I think it's him.
Who? The alien.
My alien.
I think he's come back to
claim what's rightfully his.
Gary, I'd stopped believing in him.
I mean, I thought I was just
a total sucker but...
Who else would be bidding this
kind of money for a prosthetic eye?
He couldn't contact me any other way.
So he chose eBay? Cyberspace.
I mean, even an online auction
has a certain elegant symmetry.
I think I'm finally
going to meet him.
Well, I was
doubtful at first, you know, and
then suddenly, out of nowhere - bam!
15,000. I mean, the bid jumped
to a cool cowin' 15,000.
Yeah. Yeah. I remember us talking.
I thought it was £15,005.50.
Yeah, it was, yeah.
I mean, I wouldn't spend that
kind of money unless it was my own
personal private body part
or something. Would you? No.
No. No way! I remember, yes.
I waited a couple of days and then I
got an email telling me to come to,
er...come to a restaurant.
You saw Eugene the day he died,
didn't you?
Yeah, I met up with him before
he went to meet the alien.
I had a cup of coffee.
He was scared. Was I? Course I was.
So he went to make the exchange -
£15005.50 for the eye, right?
And this was somewhere on the
A48 perhaps? Or not. Or not?
Eugene was very secretive.
Could have been in Splott? Splott?
That doesn't sound right, mate.
Who are these people with you, Gary?
Why would Eugene take
a photo of your shoes?
And, whose are the other shoes?
They're just random shoes,
I should think.
I miss him.
Yes, yes, I can remember!
I called a taxi, and then, then I
put the eye in a freezer bag.
And then there was...
Yes, I was walking up this
road going up towards...
um, a shiny building with...
a great door which
said something about...
something about...
Happiness.
Happiness.
I don't want you to
find out what happened.
I don't want this to end.
I love you.
I love you.
I thought we were on holiday.
Yes.
Yes...this is it.
We came up the hill, and there
it was! There it was, the...
The Happy Cook?
Yeah, I walked towards the door,
wondering who exactly I would be
meeting, excited, quite stressed,
shitting myself frankly.
I opened the door...
I walked in,
and saw...
I've been looking for a pair
of shoes like that for ages.
And saw...
And saw...my mates.
Hi, guys. Good to see you,
but erm...I've got the rendezvous.
It's us.
I know but...he won't want a crowd.
I'm meeting the buyer.
I'm meeting the alien.
We ARE the alien, man.
We bought it.
What? Here.
What are you having?
Erm...I'll have a milkshake,
thank you. Banana.
Yeah. So we are the official buyers.
Can we see the merchandise?
I don't quite know what
you're trying to tell me here.
See, we did it as a joke to cheer
you up. We didn't think
we'd be the actual buyers.
Then he said you said you thought
it was the alien, and we thought...
well, that's funny, innit?
Come on, Eugene, get real.
But then we thought,
"Let him dream, man.
"Life's short and really boring."
So then
we went on betting and then...
You bid 15,000 for the eye?
Not us. No. No way.
It turns out there
was real interest.
Someone else bid the fifteen
thou, but then HE got greedy.
Ketchup, please. He just couldn't
resist one more measly little bid.
£15,005.50. And then, well nothing.
Nada. Endville.
OK, shut the fuck up, Gary.
Point is, we bought it.
We are the purchasers.
Ta-dah!
So you've got
£15,005.50 on you, have you?
We've got £34.
£34, Eugene. That's not a
poke in the eye, so to speak.
I'm calling a cab.
Hey slow down.
Banana milkshake?
Thank you.
If it's all such a sodding
joke, why do you even want it?
I got a friend
with a visual impairment.
You're going to re-sell
it online, aren't you?
You cheap little gits. You know
he's out there... Who? The alien,
and he'll pay anything.
Eugene, man, I'm as partial as the
next guy to a bit of sci-fi but...
A green geezer with six eyes?
Get real, guy.
I checked the bid history.
Mr C Blackstaff is a collector of
alien ephemera and Nazi memorabilia.
Also beanie babies.
Teeny bit cuckoo,
but endearingly rich.
And if he's willing to pay 15,000...
Oi!
So now they're
inconveniencing customers.
You stepped in? Well, I tried.
I didn't really know what
the eye was any more...
..but I was damned if I was
going to let it go for £34
and a banana milkshake.
Heimlich!
Heimlich! What are you doing?
Getting the goods, idiot!
Get the milkshake!
Well, that's just not
acceptable behaviour.
Not at a Happy Cook. They were making
a public spectacle of themselves.
And that was it,
he was out the door and gone.
Oh, my God! That is so weird!
You bastards! You are so dead!
I mean, Josh, you're just a
dickhead, but Gary...
We were... I mean, we were mates.
Hi, doll.
Are you talking to me? Yeah.
Sorry. Look, I don't know whether
you remember us from last week. Yes.
Yeah, now the thing is, there may be
people coming in to ask questions.
A woman specifically. And I think...
Josh. ..it would be in your best
interests if... Shut up, Josh.
The woman is complying, man.
OK. Cool.
What did you do that for, twat?
I miss him!
So he ran out the door and
you two ran after him? Yeah.
We chased him across the car park.
But Eugene was quite fast.
Josh had new shoes,
he was making a fuss...
Hey, hey... You are overweight.
He hared across the road
and we lost him.
Honest to God.
OK.
That's it.
OK.
All those cars. All those
lives moving through space...
Hello.
Can you give me the number for Filey
Garage, Filey Road, Cardiff, please?
All that humanity whizzing by in a
frenzy of burgers and chips,
bank holiday fun, burst
tyres, screaming kids
and sudden heart-attacks.
Put me through, thanks.
Mr Jones?
You don't know me,
but I'm a friend of your son Eugene.
I've got some bad news, I'm afraid.
Now I remember.
Apart from a buzzing in my ear
where Josh whacked me, I felt good.
I was running across a
field on a Saturday morning.
The smell of exhaust
and banana milkshake,
a slight nausea, heart beating too
fast cos I wasn't that fit - all the
stuff that tells you you're alive.
By rights, I should
be well pissed off -
my mates had cheated on me
and I didn't meet any aliens, but
I realised that when I swallowed the
eye at the Happy Cook, I was given
a chance to look back on my life
and see it for what it really was.
Gary, I'm going to miss you.
Not the biggest turn-out you
could hope for, but still.
I wish I could...
God, Gwen, I wish I could say
thank you.
And here he is...
..my dad,
only 14 years late.
So, now I know it wasn't
my fault my dad left,
and that, of course,
he wasn't Superman
or an alien,
he's just an ordinary bloke.
Eugene...
He was a good boy,
but somehow...
things went wrong. I wasn't there.
I wish I could have
seen him...before...
An ordinary bloke
who made a mess of things.
# Oh, Danny Boy
# The pipes, the pipes are calling
# From glen to glen
and down the mountainside
# The summer's gone
and all the flowers dying
# Tis you must go
and I must stay behind
# But come ye back
# When summer's in the meadow
# Or when the valley's
# Hushed and white with snow
# And I'll be there
# In sunshine
# And in shadow... #
No!
Not yet.
Dad made a mess of things
and went away,
and that's a shame really,
it's a terrible pity,
because we missed each other.
Completely.
You know, 28 is one of
those perfect numbers.
It's equal to the
sum of its divisors.
I'm 28.
I was 28.
I think I'm going to
have to go soon, Gwen.
Oh, God.
Yeah.
Also, 28 centimetres per second
is the top speed of a lone lobster.
Oh, hi.
Thank you. I'm sorry I
had to ask you to do that.
Yeah, no problem.
So, if it's the eye
that's been keeping me here,
now it's no longer inside me, why
the hell am I still hanging around?
Eugene?
The eye is in the bag now,
rather than in you.
Are you...?
Hello, stranger! Did you get it?
Yeah, I got it.
Impressive.
Well, we haven't done
the tests yet, so...
Come on. We've got to go.
Jack, can you give me five? Yeah.
In an average lifetime, the human
heart will beat two million times.
You'll produce over eight
thousand gallons of saliva
and grow 350 miles of hair.
You'll eat the equivalent
in weight of six elephants.
Oh, isn't life amazing! Gwen!
GWEN!
GWEN!
Hi. Oh, my God.
Eugene! Are you OK?
It is so good to see you.
Eugene, you're on my leg.
Sorry! Sorry. No, no, it's fine.
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.
Can he see me?
(Eugene...) He can see me!
Thanks.
No, thank you. Thank you.
You just saved my life.
That's OK.
That's unbelievable.
That's un-bloody-believable.
Oh, God...
I think that's it.
Goodbye, Gwen.
Don't go now, Eugene.
Eugene, please don't go now.
Eugene, please...
Please!
The average life is full of
near misses and absolute hits,
of great love and small disasters.
It's made up of banana milkshakes,
loft insulation and random shoes.
It's dead ordinary, and
truly, truly amazing.
What you've got to realise is,
it's all here, now.
So breathe deep and swallow it whole.
Because take it from me,
life just whizzes by,
and then, all of a sudden, it's...
At least it wasn't a
spaceship full of aliens.
Which year? I need to know. 1953.
Just three lost people who've
somehow become our responsibility.
A man like you,
out of his time, alone and scared.
I hate this filthy stinking place!
I died once.
It's like two separate worlds.
There's Torchwood...then
there's real life.
I'm scared.

Tracking down alien life on earth,
arming the human race
against the future.
The 21st century is when
everything changes...
and you've got to be ready.
This programme contains
some strong language.
Hello there.
Apologies for the
unplanned touchdown,
just hit some rotten turbulence.
I'm Captain Jack Harkness.
Diane Holmes, pilot.
Is this some sort of secret base?
You must show me round one day.
Everything all right?
How long before we head off again?
My Uncle's expecting me.
When did you leave?
About half an hour ago. Which date?
Today, December the 18th.
Which year?
Which year?
Which year? I need to know.
1953.
There's no need to be frightened.
Who are you exactly?
The least you know about us,
the better.
Meet the team. Toshiko.
Gwen. Doctor Owen Harper.
John Ellis.
Emma Louise Cowell.
Diane Holmes.
Please, follow me.
At least it wasn't a spaceship
full of aliens.
That might have been easier.
But how can you travel
50 years in half an hour?
Your aircraft slipped through
a transcendental portal. A what?
A door in time and space.
It's some kind of trick,
it has to be. Tosh?
Celebrations of the Millennium
in your respective home cities,
photographs documenting the
development of Cardiff Bay
from the '50s to the present day,
blueprints of modern day aeroplanes.
But if all this is true...
then how do we get back? You don't.
According to history, your plane
never returned. I'm sorry.
What's going to happen to us?
Never mind about us.
What happened to everyone else?
Our families.
Your father died in 1959. He was 48.
Dad said he'd die young.
All the men in the
munitions factory did.
Your mother lived
till she was 81 though.
I know this is hard to take in.
But is there anyone else?
My son, Alan Ellis.
He was born on the 6th of April,
1937, 14 Park Place, Grangetown.
He might still be alive.
The archives in the '50s
weren't that well documented.
We'll try again tomorrow.
Right now,
you need to get some sleep.
Friends?
Boyfriend?
Not really. Never stayed
in one place long enough.
It's a bit basic.
Not when you've slept in barracks.
I was going to close a deal
on a shop in Dublin tomorrow.
What do you trade in?
Food, knick-knacks, essentials.
What are you after? Bit of music.
RADIO PLAYS
BEETHOVEN'S MOONLIGHT SONATA
There's photographs
of my family in here.
I'll see what I can do.
Don't worry, Captain Harkness,
I'll look after the ladies.
Call me Jack.
DISTANT LAUGHING
Who else is here?
Couple of young girls. Pretty dress.
Thank you. I made it myself.
Where are you from? Bristol.
What were you going to Dublin for?
Auntie Nora's ill and Uncle Finn
can't manage the children.
It will be good practice for when
I have children of my own, Mum says.
She's gone next door
so Uncle Finn can telephone...
She'll know I'm missing by now.
Emma, she found out in 1953.
Over 50 years have passed, remember?
What will she think happened?
It must have been like one of those
murders where they never
find the body.
They seemed to think the plane
went down in the sea.
These will be your means
of identification.
We've set up bank accounts for you
but we'll give you
an allowance so you can practice
with the currency and
money management. David Ward.
Sally-Anne Hope.
Deborah Morrison, and it's
spelt how Deborah Kerr spells it.
Your background stories
should incorporate your skills.
John, you could have run
a corner shop.
No. We can fake references.
You can't take away our names.
For God's sake,
it's all we've got left.
It's my son's name,
it's the name above my shop.
You're right.
I didn't think.
You should keep your name.
I'd suggest you use £25 for your food
and then £20 for luxuries like
cigarettes, magazines.
My dad only made £10 a week!
Things are a lot more expensive now.
How did it do that? It's automatic.
It knows you're there. But how?
There are wave bouncing detectors
which emit radio waves
and then look for reflections...
Bananas! Of course,
bananas are far more interesting.
Look at all this!
We'd just come off rationing in '53.
Yes, sorry,
we are a consumer society.
It's bloody fantastic.
How much food money have I got left?
£15.40.
£12.10. You'll ruin your teeth.
You sound like my mum.
They sell films in boxes
and you can watch them at home.
I love going to the pictures.
Good God.
Welcome to the wonderful world
of scantily-dressed celebrities.
"Super Excel Waterproof
Luscious Lashes Mascara".
I've got to have that.
There's children around.
She's a children's TV presenter.
So you like the musicals?
My best friend, Kate, and I
saw Calamity Jane five times.
I've got the LP.
You all right?
What does that mean?
I'm just going to take a look
at the stadium.
You girls stick together now.
I'll be back for supper.
Excuse me. Do you know a man called
Alan Ellis? He used to live here.
No, sorry, mate.
I'm going to check on the plane
this afternoon.
Want to come?
I'm going to watch this.
And maybe make some paper chains.
Wonder what work
I can get in aviation.
I'm going to have to find a husband.
LAUGHTER
All right?
I'm Alesha, this is Jade. All right.
I'm Emma. Diane.
Excuse me, have to get ready.
Where d'you get those shoes?
They're lush.
Thanks.
Hello, old girl,
d'you miss me?
I've been reading up on you.
England to Australia in four days,
1952, that is impressive.
Yeah, terrible wind
across the Bengal Bay.
Something you ate?
So, how did you get into this?
Ferried planes during the war.
Of course, when it was over,
we were supposed to revert to
being dutiful wives and daughters.
But I'd got the taste for it. No
pig-headed man tells me what to do.
Ah.
"Sky Gipsy"?
After the engine.
The de Havilland Gipsy Six -
a work of genius.
Tuned with a higher compression
ratio to squeeze more energy
from its fuel mixture.
Can I take her up?
No, you could get arrested.
You haven't got a licence.
But I...
Bugger, it's no longer valid.
I guess I'm just another
pig-headed man
telling you what to do.
Well, you'd better make it up to me.
I want to learn
all about this new world.
Blackpool were 3-1 down, then
Stanley Matthews worked his magic -
scored two goals
in the last 20 minutes.
Bolton lost 4-3.
My boy was on his knees,
punching the air...
The FA cup final
live in my own living room.
I charged the lads a shilling each
to come and watch.
Ever the business man, eh, John?
That's an American accent, isn't it?
That's right.
So how did you end up here,
doing whatever it is that you do?
It's a long story.
I'm a slow drinker.
You know everything about me.
What's the problem?
Gets kinda complicated.
What, did you fall through time too?
Yeah, you could say that.
Sorry, mate,
you can't smoke in here.
What are you doing Christmas Eve?
We could go carol singing.
THEY ALL LAUGH
I'll be getting hammered.
Where are your families?
No idea. We grew up in care.
Like a children's home?
I haven't got anyone else either.
What happened to you?
My parents are dead,
so I came down here to start afresh.
So they didn't leave you
a house or anything?
No.
I've got nothing.
Were you close to them?
Yes.
I loved them very much.
Must have been an awful Christmas
for them, thinking I'd drowned.
I just want to know
what kind of life he had, my son.
He might have kids.
I could be passing my own
flesh and blood in the street.
Find him, Jack,
he's all I've got left.
Cheers.
What? I'm waiting for you
to pull out my chair.
Let me get this straight.
You expect equality AND chivalry?
I don't see why they should be
mutually exclusive.
Well, if it makes you happy.
Your chair, ma'am.
Thank you.
So what other strides
have women made?
Well, on the strange but true,
how about this,
you don't have to have sex
to have kids any more. What?
How come?
Get yourself inseminated, with a sort
of syringe, cheery little process.
Seriously,
men donate sperm anonymously.
A little shuffle into a pot
at a sperm bank.
And they say romance is dead.
Oh, come on,
I wasn't born yesterday.
No, but for a bird who's going on 90
you look pretty hot.
What was your favourite song?
Well, it's hard to say.
I know what mine was.
# I just blew in from the windy city
The windy city is mighty pretty
# But they ain't got what we got
I'm tellin' ya, boys! #
What do you think you're playing at?
I thought I could trust you
to behave.
Where do you want to go now?
Well, I'm in your hands.
Well, we could go back to mine.
You could read up
about yourself on the net.
That sounds like a line.
It's not a line,
I'm not chatting you up.
Not because I don't think you're
attractive,
but because I wouldn't want you to
think I was taking advantage of you.
Got any Scotch?
I don't see why she got you
involved. She was upset.
She was drinking.
I only had half a glass.
Enough to make a show of yourself.
We're not meant to draw
attention to ourselves.
We're not the same as them.
We can't trust anyone.
Will you be OK now, Emma?
Don't worry, I won't let
her out of my sight again.
I don't like liver.
Sit down, young lady, and be
grateful for what you're given.
And why should I listen to you?
Emma? Only my dad
gets to talk to me like that...
and I'm never going
to see him again, am I?
Or my mum,
or my best friend,
or my dog and I miss them...
and I hate this filthy,
stinking place!
I never had this sort of trouble
with my son.
Woman have been to space too, y'know.
You've got a lot of
catching up to do.
Do you have a girlfriend? No.
So who do all those beauty
products belong to? Me, actually.
No?
Oi, real men can moisturize too,
you know.
It's not very homely here.
No, I'm not here that much,
it doesn't seem worth the effort.
You smoke too much.
So I gather.
Amelia Earhart...
she disappeared in 1932.
Do you think she's
still out there somewhere?
No, doubt it.
One in a zillion chance,
you ending up here.
A whole new world.
Oh, it's not so bad,
once you get used to it.
I reckon you'll fit in just fine.
I'm glad you haven't got
a girlfriend.
Me too.
# ..Come around
and knock me down again
# Worry
# Oh, worry, worry, worry,
worry... #
I take it that
wasn't your first time?
I had a lover.
He was married.
And you didn't care?
Well, I was free to do what I liked
and I didn't have to cook
and clean for him.
It suited me.
I'm not exactly marriage material.
I always thought the '50s were
uptight, sexually repressed and...
You didn't invent it, you know. Oh?!
Can we do it again?
Don't see why not.
We could have an affair.
We could be fuck buddies.
What's a fuck buddy?
It's, um,
it's a friend that
you have casual sex with.
There's nothing casual
about what we just did.
Oh, no, no, I didn't mean that.
Sex shouldn't be devalued.
Both parties should give it
100% concentration.
Because when you
take off together...
It's the next best thing to flying.
SHE SCREAMS
Emma is my auntie's step-daughter.
She meant to spend Christmas in
Cardiff with a friend
but they had this awful argument
last night and she rang me.
Got my number from Mum.
The thing is, she doesn't really
want to go back home so I thought...
I thought maybe, she could stay with
us. We've got a lot to catch up on.
For Christmas?
GWEN MOUTHS
I'd better get a bigger turkey.
Thanks. This is Rhys,
my long-suffering boyfriend.
He lives here.
Don't your parents mind?
Emma's parents are a bit religious.
Oh, better not tell them
you saw my morning glory then, eh?
The thing is I couldn't tell him
your parents were dead.
He'd ask too many questions.
The thing is, he doesn't know
exactly what I do.
We can't expect John and Diane
to look after her.
They're strangers.
I had to take her in.
Diane didn't even come home last
night. I think she was in a B&B.
I'll take her job-hunting later.
Jack, John's son.
I think I've found him.
Come and meet Alan, though I'm not
sure how much help he'll be to you.
Alan,
there's someone here to see you.
He's a nephew on your father's side.
He's been tracking down
the family history.
Is Sally coming?
Sally's his wife.
She passed away a while back.
Sorry, this isn't
one of his better days.
What's wrong with him?
Alzheimer's.
What's that? He's senile.
He doesn't remember who he is
most of the time.
Couldn't live at home any more.
He'd leave hobs on,
forget to dress, you know.
He never had any children so there
was no-one there to look after him.
That's you and your dad
playing footie out the back.
That's your dad and your mum
and your new television set.
When can I go home?
You're not well enough, love.
I don't like it here.
They took my clothes.
I'll have a word, they're in the
wash. Keeps me going, this one.
What did he do, for a living?
Was he in retail?
I think he was a fireman.
That's what I did.
In the war.
£60 for half an hour!
No worries. I'll pay.
A Cessna!
Oh, it's my first plane.
I bought one after the war,
they've hardly changed.
Dream to fly.
We'll soon get you back
behind the...throttle.
Thanks, Owen.
Matthews did three set-ups
in 20 minutes,
then Bill Perry
cracked home the winner.
You said he had wings on his feet
and that's why he was
called a winger.
You used to say clever
things like that. Blackpool won.
Yes!
Alan, it's me, your dad.
I bought you that football annual
you wanted for Christmas, Alan.
It was in my desk drawer.
Alan, please...
Everything all right?
He remembered who won the FA Cup
final when he was a boy.
He sometimes remembers
snippets from his childhood.
It's quite common with dementia.
When's Dad coming, Mum?
I'm not your mum, love.
Alan?
Who are you?
John's witnessing the end of
his world, the end of his line.
And we can't help.
There's no puzzle to solve,
no enemy to fight...
just three lost people who have
somehow become our responsibility.
Best I can do is Friday 29th,
three o'clock.
Can't you take her up today?
Fully booked.
It's all right, I've flown
for years. I can go on my own.
Not without a licence, sorry.
Maybe you could cancel someone?
We'll pay extra. I couldn't
do that do my regulars.
Look, it's fine.
Book me in for the 29th.
It's Diane Holmes.
Diane, I'm really sorry.
I should have called ahead.
Oh, for goodness' sake,
this is so silly.
It's just I was
really looking forward...
Ignore me. Let's get out of here.
MUSIC: "I See You Baby"
by Groove Armada
Do you think
she'll be all right though?
I don't think she's even had a proper
boyfriend. Stop fussing.
She'll be fine, man.
What was that for?
For putting up with me.
I deserve a lot more for doing that.
Oi! Hands off!
Go back to your friends, good boy.
What are you playing at?
I wouldn't let him do anything.
You might not have had much choice.
Gwen, you're over-reacting.
I was just having a kiss
and a cuddle.
He was after a lot more than that.
This is...disgusting.
I just want you to know that people
are more sexually aware these days.
Then maybe you'll be more careful.
Mum said that no man wants to marry
soiled goods. Attitudes have changed.
As long as it's safe and between
two consenting adults, no-one cares.
So...how many men have you
done it with?
A few.
Were you in love with all of them?
No. Sex can just be about
having a good time together.
If you're in the right mood,
with the right guy, it's the best,
no big deal.
So if I meet a boy and we get on,
and he wants sex,
then you think I should let him?
No, no, that's not what I said.
What are you saying?
Sex...is nothing to be ashamed of.
And as for you, well, your first
time should be with someone special.
Do you wish you'd waited for Rhys?
He's your special someone, isn't he?
Yes... Yes, I suppose.
And I bet sex with him
is better than with the others.
Well...
I will wait for Mr Right, I think.
I'm really not the kind of girl
who sleeps around.
I'm going to brush my teeth.
Thanks for the chat.
Not a problem.
Leave it.
I can't if I want to fly
a jet plane,
because that's all flying is now -
pressing buttons.
You used to have to know
how to fix an engine,
how to gauge the wind but...
Leave it.
Open this.
Oh!
It's beautiful.
Well, how did it go?
This coat I'm wearing is their
latest fashion, '50s inspired.
They offered me a job on the spot.
Oh, that's brilliant. Oh!
Now we need to find you a flat
near here.
The shop's in a new branch in London.
I've always dreamt about
working in a London fashion house.
They open the day after Boxing Day.
I'll be a shop girl
and a trainee buyer.
I can house share. They've given me
numbers.
London's a big city.
That's what my mum used to say.
There's no rush.
There's nothing to keep me here.
I'm sure we can find you
something in Cardiff.
You keep looking.
Need to make a plan, get work,
get my driving licence.
It will all help. Thanks, Jack.
I was looking for a bus timetable.
Want to get out to the DIY stores,
see if there's any work going.
Best of luck! Thank you.
Where are you taking me?
We're here.
Bear with me.
We have had such a girly day
shopping.
What's up?
Your mum rang.
Funny thing,
she's no idea who Emma is.
No? And I'm thinking back
to you and me on the couch...
Work calls, you go out
in the middle of the night
and come back with
a surprise relative.
So, let's have it,
who exactly is Pollyanna?
Ah, is it to do with work?
It's so hard to explain.
Do you even know her?
She was lost.
I'm sorry.
What worries me is how easy it is
for you to lie to me.
It's my fault.
I'll leave by tomorrow.
You don't have to go.
She's 18 years old.
I couldn't turn my back on her.
It's like two separate worlds -
there's Torchwood,
and then there's real life.
That's why you've got to let me go.
I, er,
couldn't help noticing you standing
out here in that beautiful dress.
This beautiful dress
is a gift from my lover.
Then he is a fool
to let you go out in it alone.
What shall we drink to?
Chance meetings.
# Oh, the good life
# Full of fun
# Seems to be the ideal
# Mm, the good life
# Lets you hide
all the sadness you feel
# You won't really fall in love
# For you can't take the chance
# So please be honest
# With yourself... #
Let's go home.
# It's the good life
# To be free
# And explore the unknown... #
MOBILE RINGS
# Like the heart aches
# When you learn
you must face them alone... #
Hello?
My car keys are missing.
John was behind the counter
earlier on
and I can't get hold of him.
He's gone home.
John!
John!
Let me go!
You can't just throw it away,
not without trying.
I'm not as strong as you.
You don't understand.
I do. I was born in the future.
Lived in your past.
My time is gone too.
Why are you doing this?
Speaking to me in bloody riddles,
keeping me here when my wife
is dead, my son is a shell.
John, you're still young.
You can get work, make friends,
start a family.
I did all that, Jack.
Years ago.
When I was meant to.
I wish I could say something.
There's nothing to say or do.
I can't leave you here.
Then we'll wait.
The sun will rise,
we'll have some breakfast,
take a walk.
Yes.
A new day.
And I'll suffer it all
and smile and wag my tail.
And then,
as soon as your back is turned,
I'll make sure I do it properly.
Because I want to die.
You don't get reunited, John.
It just goes black.
How do you know?
I died once.
Who are you? A man,
like you, out of his time,
alone and scared.
How do you cope?
It's just bearable.
It has to be.
I don't have a choice.
But I do.
If you want to help me,
let me go with some dignity.
Don't condemn me to live.
Are you scared?
Yes.
You're very quiet.
I don't know if I can
do this anymore.
This isn't how it works for me.
I've slept with enough women,
I've done the fuck buddies thing.
This is not it.
I can't concentrate.
All I see is you,
all I can think about
is what you're wearing,
what you're thinking, what your face
looks like when you come.
It's been, what, a week?
And it's like,
when I'm not with you,
um, I'm out of focus.
How have you done this to me?
I'm scared.
I'm fucking scared.
I love you too.
The thing about love...
is that you're always
at its mercy.
Emma, these are your tickets, OK?
On the back is your seat number,
keep this with you at all times.
I've also got you
a return just in case.
Now don't go talking to any
strangers and phone me as
soon as you get there, OK?
No!
I'm not letting you do this.
I'm not a possession, Owen.
You can't do this, it's madness.
If I listened to everyone
who told me that,
I wouldn't have broken any records.
You don't have to go.
If I don't, then I'll always
wonder what it's like.
London, Gwen.
You're not thinking straight,
let's talk about it.
No, I'm sorry.
We can make this work.
You belong here now, with me.
I belong in the sky.
Well, we can get you up in the sky.
Soon you can fly whenever you want.
Look, weather conditions are
the same as the day we arrived.
That rift will open again,
I can feel it.
Diane, listen to me,
there is no way back.
You cannot get home.
Then it will take me somewhere new.
Merry Christmas!
I'll come with you.
I fly solo, Owen.
I go faster and further than others.
We have no idea how this rift works.
You can end up anywhere.
That's the beauty of it.
It's too dangerous! It's what I do.
What about me?!
Please, please, don't go.
What memories I'm taking with me.
Merry Christmas.
'Because
when you take off together,
'it's the next best thing
to flying.'
Somebody's not only kidnapping
weevils, they're causing them pain.
These guys are using weevils
to carry out the perfect murder.
You want to release a weevil
in the middle of Cardiff?!
I've been having sex
with someone else. His name's Owen.
Who are you, Owen Harper?
We're gonna hunt you down
and we're gonna make you surrender
that creature that you kidnapped.
Out there in the darkness,
something is coming.
This programme contains
some strong language.
Torchwood, outside the Government,
beyond the police.
Tracking down
Alien life on earth and arming
the human race against the future.
The 21st century
is when everything changes
and you've got to be ready.
Diane Holmes.
How have you done this to me?
Love, you're always at its mercy.
Hate to break it to you,
but you're not my first.
Anti-Weevil spray.
Handclamps.
Come on,
let's make this easy for both of us.
This always happens
when I give them the night off.
It's not even really medium, let
alone well done. French places, see.
Remember that weekend in Paris,
the place with the wood panelling -
they'd barely even waved the steak
under the grill and you said...
Why are you looking at me like that?
Sorry, like what?
Like you'd rather be somewhere else!
It's becoming the norm, in't it?
I'm chopsing away and I look up
and you're just absent.
What's happening to us, Gwen?
I know. I'm sorry.
Is it something I've done?
Or not done?
What the hell was that?
Oh, God, what's happened to you?
Rhys, is it? Nice to meet you!
Sorry, it's an emergency, I'll
have her back for dessert. Come on...
Hold on, that's my girlfriend.
Rhys, this is Jack. Sit down, Gwen.
He's my boss. Sit the fuck down!
Don't ever speak to me like that.
Come on, Gwen. Let's go.
Hey, she's with me tonight.
One night off. You promised.
Don't you dare.
If you go now, Gwen...!
Sorry for cutting in, but I've
been having trouble with this one.
Rhys will get over it.
He always does.
You promised
you'd keep hold of your life.
Don't let it drift.
WATCH BEEPS
300 metres on the right, car park!
Jack! Over there!
Get him in, get him in!!
They're fucking mad! Hey!
Who the hell were they?!
One - since when did other
people know about Weevils?
Two - have they done this before and
if so why didn't we know about it?
Three -
what do they want with them anyway?
Might not be connected, but we've
noticed a surge of unusual injuries
being reported at the A&E unit.
Chunks taken out of legs and arms,
deep wounds to backs and stomachs.
So we have a wave of Weevil
attacks to add to our problems.
And by the way, that spray
we've used on them previously?
They're becoming immune to it.
They're mutating? Or evolving.
So any sign of the one
we lost earlier?
I've run a trace on the van's
number plate... it's fake.
2,500 vans of that type
registered in the Cardiff area.
Widen that to a forty mile
radius and the number doubles.
So, run a trace on the vehicle.
Route via traffic cameras?
This is Owen's voice mail, leave a
message if you must. Processing now.
Leave a message for Gwen and Rhys,
and we'll call you back...
if we remember... oi!
Hi, it's me.
I've left three messages now.
Look, I've got dozens
of excuses, em...
..hundreds. Thousands!
But none of them good enough.
Things have got away
from me a bit lately.
It's this job - it never lets up.
Look, I'll see you later.
I'm not sure what time yet.
I've got some work
to finish off first.
Call me.
Message deleted.
MOBILE RINGS
Are you going to answer that?
Ninth missed call - work.
Do you enjoy your job then?
Look, if you don't mind...
I came out to be alone.
Ah, the old Greta Garbo.
Something like that.
Little bit of advice -
next time you feel like this,
you should stay in.
Trust me, the bigger the crowd,
the more alone I feel.
I said - no chatting up the punters.
Tommy, I work in a bar.
It's my job to speak to them.
You're never happier than when you're
flashing your tits at a dickhead.
Don't talk to her like that. You
what? We were having a conversation.
When you grown up, you'll realise
that's what human beings do.
Tommy, stop. You'll get me the sack!
It's about using your opponent's
aggression to your own ends.
Now, I'd suggest you don't
pick fights with strangers.
And you should really
upgrade your boyfriend.
What does a man have to do
to get some peace in this city?
MOBILE RINGS
Owen's still not answering
his phone. he's been even more
erratic than usual since that
thing with Diane. Since the what?
It's none of my business.
What thing?
What thing, Tosh?
Owen and Diane.
Before she took the plane,
they had a...thing.
You knew that, right? Oh, yeah,
of course I knew that.
I just didn't know
they had a thing...
thing.
It started ten minutes ago.
WEEVIL HOWLS
What d'you think it's doing?
I think it's weeping. Why?
Owen's been studying this one,
thinks they have a low
level of telepathic ability
to share emotion across distance.
You mean it might be feeling
the pain of another Weevil?
I kinda hope we're wrong, though.
Why?
Because that would mean somebody's
not only kidnapping Weevils,
they're causing them pain.
What can you feel?
What do you know?
I've tracked the van's route.
It went straight from the
car park out to the docks.
This was two hours ago.
What happened?
The CCTV cameras went down.
D'you think it was deliberate?
I think these guys really
don't like to be watched.
See, and I know it's
a character flaw...
that makes me all the more
determined to find out
what it is they're hiding.
Looks like we missed them.
Yeah, but if you quit places in
a hurry, you tend to be forgetful.
Y'know what they used these
warehouses for during World War Two?
Storing the bodies of dead GIs.
Sometimes, you can know
too much history.
DOOR CLANGS
Come on.
There's nothing here.
So what were they doing here?
Why come all this way out?
What is it? Looks human.
Male. Is he alive? Hello?
You OK there?
We're looking for the people
who were here last night!
If you saw anything, now's
a good time to speak up.
Jack, he's bleeding!
Oh, my God! Weevil marks.
You don't think it's still here?
No. We'd hear it.
Now help me with the body.
FUNNY RING TONE
Is that his?
You don't think
I'd choose that ring tone?
Don't answer it.
Hello? 'I don't know who you are.
'Stay out of what
doesn't concern you.'
Who killed this man?
'Did you hear what I just said?'
I have this selective deafness when
I'm talking to cowards or murderers.
'Don't interfere in things
you don't understand.'
Oh, I understand
this better than you.
Cos I know how this is going to end
- we're going to hunt you down.
We're going to ensure that you're
punished for what happened here.
And we're going to make you surrender
that creature that you kidnapped.
Is that clear enough?
Ianto? I need you to trace
all calls to and from this number
in the last 24 hours.
Fast as you can.
We're on our way back.
MOBILE RINGS
This is Owen's voicemail.
Don't leave a message.
Nice try, Owen. I want you
back at the Hub immediately.
We've got a Weevil murder, so get
your boney little ass over here now.
Dan Hodges, date of birth,
21st of January 1979.
Salesman for web
publishing software.
Looks like he was
married with a kid.
Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.
Right, definitely death by Weevil,
but he took a right kicking
before the throat was punctured.
Weevils go for the kill,
straight for the jugular.
Look at his face - black eye,
bruises to the cheekbones.
Same across the back and the ribs.
Could he have been tortured? Maybe.
But I reckon these wounds
were inflicted by humans.
But why smack somebody about
and then set the Weevil on them?
Why not get the Weevil
do all the work for you?
Any joy with the phone records?
The last incoming number was
blocked. The phone's call history
has been erased.
God, they move fast.
You ask me, these guys are
using Weevils to carry
out the perfect murder.
No fingerprints, no traces
of recognisable DNA,...
a quick, guaranteed death.
Nothing to connect anyone
to the murder.
Right. Should be a piece
of piss to find the killer, then.
What about this guy?
Someone's got to break it
to his wife that he's dead.
The shittiest part about
being a police officer
and I can't get away from it.
Thanks for your kind words
of support.
What d'you want me to say?
She'll be all right in the end?
You can always count on Owen
to make you feel better.
Tosh mentioned you and Diane...
Did you...
I didn't want her to go. She went.
Why are we still
doing this, me and you?
Fine. Let's not. I was getting
bored of your fuck-tricks, anyway.
You can be such a wanker
sometimes, Owen, d'you know that?
I do, as a matter of fact!
Where the hell have you been?
Walking.
Well, in your absence,
Toshiko's had a great idea.
Well, it had to happen sooner
or later. Ignore him, Tosh.
Yeah, just ignore me, Tosh.
I can be such a wanker. Apparently.
The van went with the Weevil
straight to the warehouse.
They must've known it was empty.
Either they own it or had previous
contact with the estate agents.
Owen Harper,
you're going into property.
Toshiko's in the middle of fixing
you a cover story. Hang on, why me?
Jack and Gwen were in the car park,
I was in the warehouse.
If they've got access to CCTV,
they'll recognise us.
We have to get under their guard,
find out what's going on.
Yeah, all right.
I could do with being
someone else right now.
Mr Harper? Yeah. Mark Lynch.
You're looking to relocate
your business to Cardiff? Yeah.
And you export jellied eels. Really?
Huge growth market.
China, South America,
I'm having a nightmare trying to
keep up with demand. I'll er...
get you a batch if you find me
the right gaff.
I think I'll pass on that.
Any family to relocate?
Just me. It's better that way.
And you're looking for premises
out by the docks?
Mmm, nice big warehouse,
that's what I need.
I've got a couple
that should be perfect.
Hang on while I print. Thanks.
We're in! This'll give us
everything on his hard drive,
including encrypted files.
If I can establish a routing
protocol, whatever he does on
this computer from now on,
we'll know about it.
Owen, you're clear.
These have got the square
footage you're looking for,
good access, competitively priced...
Except...
these all look like shitholes to me.
Yeah.
They are a bit.
Didn't I see your sign outside a big
place in the Q section of the docks?
We've accepted an offer on it.
Pretty much signed and sealed.
He's lying.
According to their records, it only
went on the market last week.
Bummer. What about a unit
on an industrial estate?
Save a ton on rent, even
after transport costs.
And you just happen to have
a list of suitable premises? Nah.
There are other possibilities. You
free at the end of the day? Yeah.
Go for a drink?
On your own in a strange city.
I remember that feeling.
And look at you now.
Couple of gorgeous birds answering
your phones for you. If that's
not success, I dunno what is!
It's all bollocks, really.
But, if you wanted me
to put in a good word... No.
Thanks.
Good to meet you, Mark.
Yeah. I'll give you a bell.
First, he'll go for the weblink
at the top of the page...
Then he'll want to know what
other people say about the business.
Now he'll see what
Owen has to say about himself.
Welcome to the number one supplier
of jellied eels to Britain
and Northern Europe.
With a client base of more than 150
resellers, we're constantly looking
to expand into new territories.
If you're interested in
becoming an affiliate
or Harper's franchise holder,
please contact our Sales Director
on the number below.
Harper's sales. Jenny Long speaking.
I'm sorry, wrong number.
Job done.
I've found another set of
suspicious injuries at the hospital.
They sound pretty bad.
Tosh, stay here and monitor
Mark Lynch's movements.
Ianto with me.. I'll come with you.
Go home. But... It's not a request.
Remember - don't let it drift.
What you doing?
You here now, are you?
That's your pulling top.
No, it's not. It is!
That's what you call it,
since I said you looked sexy in it.
You off out? Aye, Daf's stag do.
All day job. Since when
is Daf getting married?
He's not. But he thinks
he's missing out on a piss-up.
He's having a Staying Single Stag.
Few beers, see what transpires.
Strip club, that sort of thing.
What time will you be back?
Not sure.
But...I'm in tonight.
Well, I'm not.
I've already made
my statement to the police.
According to your chart,
you nearly had your heart
torn from your ribcage.
Ten-hour operation
to repair chest wounds.
Why should I talk to you?
Let me tell you what did this to you.
Six feet high,
teeth like a shark, rippled skin
and the rage of a wild animal.
Am I close?
I was mugged.
There was three of them,
they had knives.
So why were your wounds described by
paramedics as bite marks?
Look, I can't help it
if they got mixed up.
They're overworked. There are
lots of ways I can get
you to talk, but the easiest would
be if you consider the consequences
should you not tell me the truth.
And that is,
this creature will attack again.
Somebody will die.
And it will be on your conscience.
Now tell us the truth. I can't.
They'd kill me.
Who'd kill you? Everyone.
What did he mean, "everyone"?
That was all he'd say.
Couldn't get any more out of him.
That leaves us one option.
OK, Janet. Time for a trip out.
You call it Janet?
Barbara just never seemed right.
You want to release a Weevil
in the middle of Cardiff?!
Not exactly in the middle.
A little to the side.
We placed a tracker in its boiler
suit, so when they capture it,
we'll know where they are.
It could kill any number of people
before then! I'm with Tosh.
We set it loose in the same place
where they took the other one.
It's deserted this
time of night. We'll be with it
every step of the way.
Tracker working? Yeah.
Go Janet!
Second right. 200 metres ahead.
Shit! Stop the car!
She's taken a left.
Pedestrian access only! Ahh!
Ianto, take over!
Now that's what I call service.
Cheers.
Yeah. Cheers.
Shit.
We got a problem here, boys?
Not with you.
Come on then,
let's get it over with.
No need for you to get
involved, sweetheart.
Get up!
Thanks.
The Weevil has landed.
Got a signal?
Yeah.
Just so I know where we stand?
We would never deliberately
put a human being through that.
But Weevils are fair game.
Is that right?
We need to follow them.
This is your gaff?
Make yourself at home.
I'm in the wrong business.
So, what's your outlet?
Er, for what?
The anger.
Who said I was angry?
You're not even living here yet and
you've got people coming after you!
Yeah, well.
some people need teaching a lesson.
I'm not criticising. You're not
the only pissed off bloke out there.
It's what the world does to us.
Fancy a beer?
Yeah, why not.
You work yourself stupid.
Get a house, a car, plasma screen...
You end up with a workforce,
people there specifically
to look after your every whim.
You're officially successful.
And what does it bring?
Nothing. Success has
no worth other than itself.
Seriously, I could live without
all this. It doesn't define me.
Yeah, nice to have it, though, yeah?
Ask yourself,
what's the point of your life?
Mark, mate,...
I only came here for a beer.
There's so much more.
If you know where to look.
Is that right?
It's closer than you think.
Something's coming.
Out there
in the darkness, something
is coming.
You drunk?
Two pints was all I could get down.
They've gone on without me.
Look, Gwen...
I need to tell you something.
What sort of thing?
I've been sleeping... I've been
having sex with someone else.
From work.
His name's Owen.
He's a tosser and it's all gonna
stop but... Shut up. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
You wouldn't do that! But I have.
The.. then why are you telling me?
Because I'm ashamed. And I'm angry.
And I want...I need...
I need you to forgive me.
And because I've drugged you.
You've done what?! Just sit down.
It's nothing, it's just an
amnesia pill. Dash of sedative.
You'll wake up tomorrow, and you'll
forget everything. Rhys?
God, you selfish bitch! I know,
I just thought it would give us a
chance, a chance to get everything
out in the open, you know?
Get everything out.
Rhys! Stay with me, Rhys!
Say you forgive me,
say, "It's all right, Gwen.
"Gwen, it's all right."
Say it, please, Rhys.
Rhys, just say it once,
say it once, "I forgive you."
Rhys, please say it!
Say you forgive me!
Say you forgive me, say it.
Say it, please, say it.
Say it, please.
You found the bathroom yet?
Yeah, cheers!
GROWLS
Told you there was more to see.
Mark, mate, I'm really sorry.
I couldn't resist a padlock...
What do you think? What is it?
No idea.
Don't get too close, though.
Vicious bastard.
Where did you get it from?
I found one on the streets.
It took five of us to bring it in.
Other than that, haven't got a clue.
Scientific experiment gone wrong?
Nuclear victim?
One of the lads even
reckons it's an alien.
Want to know what I think?
Yeah, go on.
I think it's us, Owen. You and me.
In a thousand years' time.
This is what we become, when
all we have left is our rage.
Not exactly a comforting thought.
Give it a smack. You what? Punch it.
Why? That's what it's there for.
Or d'you want me to do it for you?
It just feels a bit weird,
that's all.
All right, that's enough!
It's not exactly putting up a fight.
We all need a punchbag.
So, who are you, Owen? Sorry?
It'd be pretty stupid not to
assume that you're not connected
to those two in the black SUV.
I dunno what you mean. Bloke in the
big coat, cute little Asian girl?
I was watching. Nice website by
the way, kudos to whoever did
that, although jellied eels...
That wasn't your greatest idea.
I wasn't that bad!
Pretty much, you were.
Whoever you are, you've royally
fucked up my plans.
Didn't want this getting out.
What about Dan Hodges,
what about his wife and kid?
I'm not responsible
for people's life choices.
Now why did you lot take the body?
Why didn't you go to the cops?
Because, Mark, they are parochial
pigshits whose minds would implode
if they saw this.
Who are you, Owen Harper?
Is that who you are?
A little kid hiding behind a gun.
If you want to know what
happens, you won't find
out because of a weapon.
Good boy,
we're finally getting somewhere.
Now you're just you. Stripping
things back to the core, Owen.
Now, we're just two blokes.
Equal.
Why did you murder Dan Hodges?
I didn't.
All right, not technically.
Did you do it here?
I mean, you let that thing
loose on him.
The perfect murder. Nothing
to link you back to the crime.
God, you haven't
got a clue, have you?
Dan wasn't murdered. He was one
of us. Tell me what happened.
I can do better than that.
Come on!
Hello?
Anyone?
So where is it, Tosh?
So what have we got now? Nothing.
We have no clue where they are
or what they're doing.
So, what am I
supposed to be looking at?
Wait and see.
All this lot with you?
What's going on?
You'll find out.
I've never been that keen
on surprises.
Jack, I...
'Jack, can you hear me?'
What the hell are you doing there? I
told you to go home.
There's a text message that's just
come through on Dan Hodges' phone.
'Charlie Foxtrot One
Zero Six Bravo Yankee.'
Seems to be a postcode for
a building. One that's gonna have
a Lynch Frost sign outside.
OK, I've got the location.
Gwen, we'll pick you up on the way.
People get a text message
and they head to a property?
An empty property.
So the question is -
what happens when they get there?
What the hell's going on here?
Warm-up. Warm-up?
Who are these blokes? Same as us.
Ordinary blokes trying
to find meaning in a world
that doesn't have any.
You don't really believe that?
We're the dispossessed now, Owen.
All the certainties
our fathers had are gone.
We're a generation of no faith.
In society,
in religion... or in life.
All we can do
is reduce ourselves to the basics.
This is only the warm-up. Come on.
Coming or staying?
Five, four, three, two, one!
Get me out!
Nice one, mate.
Costs a grand to enter the cage.
Whoever stays in the longest takes
home all the money. You're next!
So these guys are paying
to put their lives at risk?
The ultimate extreme sport.
Too much disposable income,
not enough meaning. That's us.
So what about Dan Hodges, Mark?
He wouldn't come out.
Just stood in the middle
of the cage and let it maul him.
I think he got in there
and he realised...
he didn't want to live enough.
He surrendered. None of us
could get to him in time.
Yeah. And still you all come back.
Well, what else is there?
This has to stop.
More people are gonna die.
How long are we going to keep
playing this game, Owen?
You lie,
you bullshit and sweet talk.
But you are hiding, Owen.
Get in the cage.
Not if you're gonna
point a gun at me.
Do you want me to shoot you?
Lower the gun.
And then I will get into the cage.
Good boy.
What's the longest anyone's been
in there? That'd be Dan Hodges.
when you're up close with it, take
a look into its eyes. Open the door!
It's like looking into the
darkest recesses of your own soul.
Open the door!
Owen!
I said open the door!
Jack!
Open it!
Owen? Get off me!
That's enough!
Help me, Jack, help me get him out!
Owen, come on... Get a stretcher!
You did this to him. He did it
to himself, he had no fear.
It's over now.
These creatures are to be left alone.
Go back to your lives. Jack!
What're you doing? It's over.
THE MAN WRITHES IN AGONY
You shouldn't have.
No, really you shouldn't.
I hate grapes.
Doctors reckon you can go home.
Doctors. What do they know, eh?
I didn't want saving.
You want us to apologise?
For a few seconds in that cage,
I felt totally at peace.
And then you blunder in.
Do you always know best, Jack?
Is that what you believe?
Want you back in work tomorrow.
You sure you'll be all right?
Give us a moment alone, yeah?
Where's the SUV?
Has it been stolen?
No, we have.
They're stuck in the middle
of the Cardiff Blitz! Toshiko!
It's our duty to get them out.
Open the rift now and the
whole world could suffer.
Or who knows what will come out?
I love you.
It's a trap to
incite total chaos and destruction!
You don't even know who he is!
He's our leader. Not any more!
Captain Jack Harkness,
133rd Squadron.
Torchwood. Outside the government,
beyond the police.
Tracking down alien life on earth
and arming the human race
against the future.
The 21st century is when everything
changes and you've got to be ready.
Diane Holmes, pilot.
Please, don't go.
Come on. Aaargh!
I didn't want saving.
This programme
contains some strong language.
CAR HORN BEEPS
TOSH SPEAKS JAPANESE
It's my grandfather's
88th birthday today.
I thought you'd done this for me.
88 is a joyous year
for the Japanese.
I'm off to London
to watch men throw rice.
You get that in the Balti
after stop-tap.
OK, down to business.
What have we got?
The Ritz Dancehall.
It's been derelict since 1989
but someone's complained about
hearing music...
music from the 1940s.
Shhh!
Listen.
MUSIC PLAYS SOFTLY
You coming up?
WINGS FLAP
Wow!
Look at the chandelier.
No neon lights back then.
Just dashing young soldiers
and pretty young ladies.
And as they danced, the girls
would look into their partners'
eyes, smile softly and say...
Jack! Mind my laptop.
I was thinking more along
the lines of, "How long
before you head off to war?"
MACHINE BEEPS
Come on. There's nothing here
but memories and dust.
BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYS
VOICES CHAT AND LAUGH
They look so real.
They're not ghosts.
It's a simple temporal shift.
And it's beautiful!
We should get out.
Do call again. I would love to.
It's night!
Where's the SUV?
Has it been stolen?
No.
We have.
ALARM BEEPS
What the hell is that?
Tosh's rift monitor programme.
She set it to alert me if there
were any further movements.
The rift's been opening
more and more recently.
Yeah, well, I've noticed that.
Doesn't take a genius.
Tosh reckons the equations
are forming a pattern.
I should call her.
She may have readings her end
and this is over my head.
Um, why wasn't I told about this?
Well, you've been off, haven't you?
The line's dead.
It's no use. It's dead.
I can't get through to the Hub.
Let's get back inside.
That's where we were
when we crossed.
'Gwen, can you get down
to Sage Street?'
Yep. What's up? 'We need Tosh.'
The rift monitor sounded. She's
with Jack but their phones are dead
and we can't access her files.
'OK, I'll get down there now'.
We really are in 1941.
What if we can't get back?
Flotsam and jetsam slips through
all the time. We'll get back.
Look on the bright side.
Gives you one hell of an excuse for
your party. I have a life there.
And they can't help us because
I have the latest readings in here.
People are staring at us.
We need to try to blend in.
It's easy for you to say.
I'm the only Asian here. Don't worry.
You're with the Captain.
Hey. I've got into Tosh's files,
all her reports.
See there, December 24th.
That's when Diane
flew through the rift.
I had to let her go.
You were in love with her,
weren't you?
If Tosh knows a way
of opening the rift,
maybe we can get Diane back.
Jack would never allow it. Opening
the rift could devastate the city.
# My love is true
# And just for you
# I would do most anything
at any time... #
Water, please, and a brandy.
I haven't seen you in here before.
Three and six, please, sir.
I'll, er...
get them.
Thank you. On one condition. What?
# Come to me,
my melancholy baby... #
Why's George dancing with a Jap?
The SUV's here.
They must be here somewhere.
Jack?
Tosh!
MUSIC DRIFTS DOWN
Jack!
# Come to me, my melancholy... #
Do you mind?
I'm only borrowing her, mate. Maybe
she doesn't want to be borrowed.
You want to make something of it?
You can always dance with me.
OK, I'll lead. You follow.
Come on, Tosh.
CROWD GASP
Jack!
Jack, we're meant to be blending in.
Cut it out, kiddo.
Sorry about that.
The men are a bit lively tonight.
It's last day of OTU tomorrow.
Apologise to the gentleman, George.
I was only dancing.
I think it was your fist
he didn't like, not your foxtrot.
I'm sorry.
It's OK. You barely got me.
I think the lady also deserves
an apology.
I'm sorry.
Apology accepted.
Let's get a drink, George.
Hey, are you a volunteer too? Yeah.
BOTH SPEAK AT ONCE: I'm Captain...
You go first. I'm Captain
Jack Harkness. 133rd Squadron.
Look this way, please.
Right, the Ritz Dancehall,
opened in 1932, shut down in 1989.
Due to be demolished in one week.
Now, the reported music
is from the 1940s.
Why is a ghost job taking them this
long? All those young soldiers...
Owen, look.
There.
One more for the record, sir.
I insist.
Thank you, gentlemen.
I should be heading off..
Hey, I didn't catch your names.
Toshiko Sato.
I'm Captain James Harper. 71st.
71st, that's where I'm hoping
to be posted. What's your poison?
Maybe later. My friend and I were
in the middle of something. Sure.
Why does that man have your name?
I'm lost enough here
without you holding back on me!
It's not my name.
It's his.
I took his.
But I didn't realise he was...
so hot!
Jack!
I know too much.
Then...share.
You wouldn't want that. Trust me.
We have to get back.
What's in here?
I've got half the equation in here.
The other half's back at the Hub.
If I can find some way of getting
these figures back to base,
they can combine them, open the rift
and bring us back through. Come on.
I heard music earlier.
If I can hear them,
maybe they can hear me.
They've got to come back.
WINGS FLAP OVERHEAD
Jack!
Tosh!
What?
I thought I heard my name.
OK, so we use Tosh's information
to open the rift
and bring them back.
We can't.
Half the equation's missing.
It can't be. It must be somewhere
else. Let me try. It's not there.
It might be in her laptop. Which
she never goes anywhere without.
Shit. Shit!
No-one here. Come on, quick.
It works! LAPTOP: 'Your battery
is running low'.
Just take down everything,
in case it dies.
I'm not used to writing with these
things! Don't press so hard.
Oh, no. LAPTOP: 'Your battery
is low.' Can you read that?
Plus one over five a...
sine two eight X.
LAPTOP: 'Your battery...'
You got everything you need? I just
need the coordinates of the hall,
so I can integrate them
into the equation.
Then we need to get the information
back to the Hub.
What are you doing in here?
Who are you?
Captain...James Harper.
And this is Toshiko Sato,
friend and mathematician.
I'm Bilis, the manager.
You're not in full uniform, Captain.
On leave.
48 hours.
That's an interesting camera.
It takes photographs instantly. I
didn't know they could do that yet.
And I didn't know they made
an attache case out of metal.
CLOCK CHIMES
Where did you get it?
London. I'm from there.
I should go back, dear.
They're coming for us now.
I've had a good look around
but the doors were locked.
MUSIC RESUMES INSIDE
Can I help you?
I'm the caretaker.
Bilis Manger, at your service.
Hello. Could you open it all up
for me? I think some of my friends
got locked in. Follow me.
Thank you.
Pearl Harbour, Jack. Doesn't happen
till the end of the year.
Granddad stayed in London
but he was persecuted.
If I stay here,
what will happen?
I'll take care of you.
This period,
you look like you fit in.
Have you been here before?
Yeah.
I can't explain
but I served in the war in 1941.
I was undercover.
I needed a false identity,
so I took...his name.
Who were you
before you took his name?
Why him? It was convenient.
But if you chose his identity
to steal, then he...?
Dies, in battle.
When?
Tomorrow.
And I say, "Look, love,
it's raining bombs and fire,
so get down that cellar."
And she says, "I can't,
there's rats down there!"
So, who's the best navigator here?
Tim. He can't fly for toffee,
but at least when he goes down,
he'll know exactly where he is.
Why don't we chat over here?
HE WOLF-WHISTLES
I give the public schoolboy
a fortnight.
That boy's come a long way
in five weeks.
As long as you boys remember
your training, you'll be all right.
Glad you came. Shall we sit down?
Why were your friends in here,
anyway? Just a silly dare.
Someone said it was haunted.
You look worried, dear.
I'll make you a nice cup of tea.
The sun rose this morning at 08.12,
21 by 7 degrees.
I note it down every day.
It's a bit silly, I suppose.
It's fantastic.
You must have seen some action.
Let's just say the enemy comes
in many guises.
Yeah, I can't wait
to give Jerry what for.
How many did you kill in the Battle
of Britain, sir? 26, wasn't it?
You've read that story
countless times.
No-one's as fast as him.
Hasn't lost a man yet.
Care for a drink, Captain?
I'll just have water, thanks.
All right.
Hello, Jack. I know you're having
a night with the men
but I thought I'd look in,
if that's all right.
Yeah.
Good to see you.
Is anyone expecting you?
Yes.
Perhaps you should call them,
otherwise they may think
you've disappeared too.
I'll put the kettle on.
CLOCK CHIMES
Anything your end?
There are no more photographs
of Jack and Tosh after that night.
That's encouraging.
Yeah, unless the bombs got 'em.
The manager, Bilis Manger,
kept them for posterity.
Bilis Manger?
That's the name of the caretaker.
Can't be the same guy, can it?
Not old enough.
But he does look a bit
out of his time. He wears a cravat.
Gwen, he's in the photo
with Jack and Tosh.
He's the answer. He came through
the rift. Find out what he's doing.
No. Get out, Gwen. Wait for backup.
We can't lose him. Nor Gwen!
Maybe this is a trap.
He could be sucking us
back through time one by one.
Get out of there, Gwen. I'm sorry
but who put you in charge?
I've got what I need.
Now all I have to do
is find a way to leave a message
for the team on something
that will last across time. OK.
I haven't seen you two here before.
Is she with you?
Nah, she's after Tim.
Why else would she let him
bore her to death about navigation?
Maybe she's a spy. The Chinese are on
our side, aren't they? I'm Japanese.
You're hardly an ally, then.
Leave it, Audrey.
So whose side are you on?
What's in the bag? Nothing.
If you've got nothing to hide,
open the bag! She can't.
Her work is top secret.
She's a decoder for the Brits.
Without her, we'd have no way of
defending the country. To Toshiko.
Toshiko!
I need Bilis's camera.
Photographs last, don't they?
Sure you don't want me to come with
you? Oh, you can't run out on me.
I've just got you a drink.
I'm fine. You carry on.
To a fellow captain.
So, what brings you down here?
I had to rest up.
Injured my back bailing over Kent.
That's his excuse for not dancing.
Mind if I join you?
Sure. Why not?
Starting to be a habit.
I just wanted to try it out.
This little beauty is very unusual
and rare, not unlike yourself.
Don't go without this.
I could think of better things
to photograph than numbers, my dear.
Do call again.
What are you doing?
Owen!
We haven't got the missing numbers.
We'll improvise with
the Rift Manipulator. We can't.
It's risky enough with the equation.
If we don't do it properly, anything
can happen. Bombs are falling.
They're stuck in the middle
of the Cardiff Blitz.
It's our duty to get 'em out.
JACK'S LAUGHTER ECHOES
Jack?
Open the rift and the world could
suffer. We could all get sucked in.
Who knows what will come out?
This is about Diane! When will you
accept she chose to leave you?
Whereas your cyber-girlfriend
stuck around. Not that she had
a choice, wired in the cellar.
That was different. Yeah. Mainly
because Diane didn't try and kill us
and she also happened
to be a human being. Stop it.
Not some monster. I thought
she was still Lisa. I loved her.
You only knew Diane for a week.
And it wasn't enough.
Maybe the Manipulator
can calculate the missing figures.
It isn't working. Good.
Jack would never have wanted us
to use it this way.
There's a piece missing.
We've got to find it.
Maybe you should go home.
You don't have any power over me.
OK, Ianto, we'll play it your way -
safe and boring.
BUG BAND TUNE FINISHES
PEOPLE APPLAUD
So, what's your next mission?
Careless talk costs lives.
I should go anyway. No, I didn't
mean that to... It's all right.
I can get a lift if I leave now.
I'd better stay here.
Aren't you leaving tomorrow night?
You sick of us Welsh already?
Yeah, that's why I'm still
fighting for you.
I'll be in touch
when I'm next on leave.
Nancy...
it's been a good few weeks.
Was that it?
She's a sweet kid, but I need
to look after my men tonight.
It's their last day tomorrow.
Go after her.
Kiss her goodbye.
Anything can happen tomorrow.
It's just a routine training
exercise. I'm hardly gonna die.
That's when they catch you,
when you least expect it.
You don't know what's ahead.
Kiss her...goodbye.
Nancy?
I love you.
That just made things
20 times worse.
Now she thinks
she's in love with me.
Hey, her falling for you
is hardly my fault.
Play it coo in front of your men,
but not me. It's OK to be scared.
A captain has to keep his head.
A captain needs to explain risks,
tell his men what to expect.
So what do I do?
Tell 'em I saw a young boy
get shot in the eyes mid-flight?
I understand.
Do you? Did you hear him on the
radio, yelling for his mom,
while the Messerschmitts shot him
blew his plane apart?
All I can hear on the radio...
Is screams.
I went to war when I was a boy.
I was with my best friend.
We got caught crossing the border
over enemy lines. They tortured him
because he was weaker.
They made me watch him die.
And they let me go.
Who were they?
The worst possible creatures
you can imagine.
I persuaded him to join up.
I said it would be an adventure.
He hadn't lived.
Have any of us?
OK, team...
I hope you like treasure hunts.
No sign of Bilis leaving the area.
Er, where are you off to?
The dancehall.
Bilis's office.
He must know how the rift works.
Maybe we'll find a clue there.
What would Jack and Tosh do?
How would they try and help us?
Bilis!
I need more equations, Gwen.
What happened here, Tosh?
No.
AIR RAID SIREN WAILS
BOMB WHISTLES THROUGH AIR
THEY SCREAM
Toshiko!
Toshiko! Jack!
This way!
I didn't get the first part
in the photo. The rest is outside.
If they find it, they'll
keep looking, won't they? Yeah.
IANTO: 'Be careful, Gwen.
Bilis is still around'.
Owen, where are you? 'I'm in the
building. Where's Bilis's office?'
It's at the far end of the corridor.
I'll keep looking out here.
Yes!
BOMBS BOOM OVERHEAD
Thing is, you could be
the last girl I ever kiss.
I've got to finish the message.
Pencil will fade.
I need to find something else.
Airtight. This'll do.
# There'll be bluebirds over
# The white cliffs of Dover
# Tomorrow
# Just you wait and see... #
OK.
Shit!
CLOCK CHIMES
ALARM CLOCK BEEPS
Timepieces.
I didn't find any equations.
Um, I'll get back to the Hub.
I'll keep looking here, then.
Yeah, you do that.
Yes.
Of course I'm scared.
I'm going to check everywhere
for the other figures.
I'm not going to leave Jack now.
# There'll be bluebirds over... #
SONG FADES
ALL-CLEAR SIGNAL WAILS
Let the dancing continue!
ALL CHEER AND APPLAUD
I've finished.
The rest of the equation is hidden.
What happened?
I slipped. I've got a first-aid kit
in the van.
Scotch, Captain?
I'd like some time in private
with Captain Harper.
Ianto? Yeah, it's me.
I've found it.
It's written in blood.
Gwen's found the rest
of Tosh's readings.
What's she got for us?
Cos sine squared, axcx = x over 2.
No, I need at
least three more numbers, Gwen.
They must be somewhere else.
'No, they're not'.
Well, how do you know?
Somebody scraped out
the final numbers.
Tosh has written
a message at the end.
It says,
"Tell my family I love them."
Why did you make me
kiss her goodbye?
I just think you should live
every night like it's your last.
Make tonight
the best night of your life.
You're alive -
right here, right now.
Your men are fine.
What are you trying to say?
Go to her.
Go to your woman
and lose yourself in her.
Maybe I should.
Yeah.
Is Toshiko your woman? No.
There's no-one.
Go to her.
It still won't work. There's a piece
missing. Bilis had it all along.
We still don't have
all the equation.
Maybe the machine can work it out.
MACHINE BURSTS INTO LIFE
Owen!
MACHINE ENGINE SPLUTTERS OUT
There must be something in the safe.
We need better instructions.
You can't open it. You've no right.
I'm second in command.
I have got every fucking right.
There's stuff we don't know about.
That's how Jack likes it.
I won't play with his toys, Ianto!
"Rhea Silva,
the god of war's missus."
And a nine-digit number.
Not so clever, Jack.
Blueprints for the Rift machine.
I thought you'd gone.
This could be your last chance.
That's why I came back.
I might have to leave
before the night is over.
Well, then make the most of now.
WOMAN LAUGHS
We need lovers' corner,
if you don't mind, boys.
Of course. I was just discussing
strategies with the captain.
We'll go somewhere else.
No.
You've told me all I need to know.
There's instructions in here.
This isn't a random act of madness.
It's a trap!
Bilis wanted you to find it. Why?
To provoke the rift. To incite
total chaos and destruction.
All the reports of the haunted
dancehall were anonymous.
What if it was him?
Please, listen to me! I'm tired
of being in awe of the rift.
I'm tired of living with Jack's
secrets. We don't even know who he
is. He's our leader. Not any more.
Get out of my way.
Ianto! Ugh!
Tomorrow is their last
training exercise,
just another day.
They go out on a sortie
and are surprised
by two formations of Messerschmitts.
He destroys three of the enemy.
His men listen to his whoops of joy
over the radio.
Then it all goes quiet.
He can't bail out
because his whole plane is on fire.
But his men
all make it back to safety.
Put the key down.
Or I'll shoot.
Who were you?
A conman.
That's why I took his name,
falsified his records
so it seemed he was still alive.
How did you end up in Torchwood?
Someone saved my life.
Brought me back from death.
And ever since then, it's been like
they're keeping me for something
and I don't know what it is.
I'm sorry for dragging you
into this.
It was my choice.
I'll look after you.
But there's nothing I can do
for him.
You have to let Diane go.
Like I did with Lisa.
Don't compare yourself to me.
You're just a tea boy.
I'm much more than that.
Jack needs me.
In your dreams, Ianto.
In your sad wet dreams when
you're his part-time shag, maybe.
That rift took my lover
and my captain.
So if I die trying to beat it, then
it will all be in the line of duty.
Aaargh!
MACHINE STARTS UP
You don't know what you've done.
# That certain night
# The night we met
# There was magic abroad in the air
# There were angels dancing
at the Ritz
# And a nightingale sang
in Berkeley Square... #
# ..I may be right
# I may be wrong... #
What's he doing?
# ..But I'm perfectly willing
to swear... #
RIFT BLASTS OPEN
Jack!
Jack, we need to get out!
Jack, you have to!
We need you!
I have to go.
It's my duty.
Oh, you made it! You made it!
You made it.
Oh, Tosh, come here, come here,
come here! I'm fine!
GWEN LAUGHS
I knew we did the right thing,
opening the rift.
Still no sign of Bilis.
World didn't end after all, did it?
Good job you're a crap shot.
I was aiming for your shoulder.
It was wartime, I know,
but it was beautiful.
There were angels dancing
at the Ritz.
- Jack...
- Let me.
He would have been so proud
that you took his name.
Because here you are,
saving the world.
To Captain Jack.
To Captain Jack.
You know it's rude to stare.
I thought telepathy would get you
to make me a cuppa.
What's it worth? What do you want?
I'll draw you a diagram, shall I?
Nice arse!
MOBILE RINGS
Don't answer it!
Yep.
JACK: 'You watching the news?'
TV: 'There's speculation that the
incidents overnight may be linked.
'Initial reports
suggested terrorist involvement'.
'But some intelligence experts have
claimed the incidents may be stunts.
'The first sightings were of UFOs
over the Taj Mahal in India.
'They came in just after midnight.
'In London this morning, men in
historic dress fired upon police.
'Some religious groups
are claiming events overnight
'are a vindication
of their teachings.'
Do you think it is terrorists?
Terrorists bomb things.
This is different.
People didn't believe us.
Now they should.
Judgment day is finally here.
This is the End of Days.
"And I heard but did not understand
and I said, 'Master, what is the End
of all these things?' And he said,
" 'Go, Daniel, for the things are
closed up and sealed until the end
of time.' " Daniel 12, verse 10.
Sounds a bit close for comfort.
This machine's on the blink.
Keeps losing power.
Sorry, don't let me stop
your portents of doom.
Or have you finished? No.
More where that came from.
Abaddon, the Great Devourer,
who'll lead the world into shadow.
Thanks, Ianto, no superstition.
You people love any story that
denies the randomness of existence.
Thanks. That makes me feel better.
OK, I've been fielding calls.
The government, UNIT, the CIA...
Half the world
are asking one question.
Is this anything to do with us?
And is it?
I've run a profile on every reported
temporal anomaly and tracked
any physical or temporal pattern.
Shit! The cracks in time
trace back here to the rift.
This city, this Hub, is the centre.
What you're seeing around the world
are ripples and aftershocks.
The rift is splintering
because of you. What? You opened it
without knowing what you were doing.
You've caused the temporal cracks
to widen. Time is seeping through.
If it wasn't for me, you two
would still be in the 1940s.
So are we going to sit around
crying into our lattes,
or shall we do something about it?
Bring those who've fallen through
time back here, into the vaults.
And do what with them? We'll deal
with phase one, then phase two.
You can't control time. What are you
gonna do? We'll think of something!
Hey, this is not
the end of the world.
I'm certain of that.
COMPUTER BEEPS
Priority one attendance - hospital.
Mortality rate's through the roof.
They're designating a hot zone.
I'll go. Tosh, go with him.
No, thanks, I'm fine on my own.
And you'll be even better
with me alongside.
Shut up and come on.
Did you have to pick on him
in public like that?
All our actions have consequences.
And all your staff have feelings,
Jack, even Owen. Well, you'd know.
He brought you back.
Would you rather be stuck
in World War II?
Hello.
'Gwen, it's Andy'.
Listen,
I didn't know who else to call.
MAN SHOUTS IN LATIN
Double murder.
Stabbed two blokes in Penarth.
Brutal, it was. No mercy.
What are we supposed to do?
He doesn't speak a word of English,
and he's dressed as a Roman soldier!
He's not, he IS a Roman soldier
and he's shouting in Latin.
Only word I could pick out
was Gelligaer.
Gelligaer.
There's a Roman fort out at
Gelligaer. Built around 75AD.
He was on his way, time splintered,
he ends up here. Excuse me?
Hi. Any time you feel
like talking sense...
That soldier came through
a crack in time.
He's not serious, is he?
This sort of thing just
doesn't happen. Not in Cardiff.
Just cos you can't understand,
doesn't mean it isn't true.
I know it sounds mad, Andy...
All right, Mulder and Scully.
Say I do believe you, which I don't,
cos it's bollocks.
How exactly are we meant to handle
a prisoner from 2,000 years ago?
Has he got the same rights as anyone?
How's this gonna work with the CPS?
We'll take him off your hands.
HE SHOUTS IN LATIN
Under any other circumstances,
an exuberant Roman soldier would
be my idea of a perfect morning.
Careful, Jack.
PRISONER STOPS SHOUTING
Everyone's saying it, you know.
In work, on the streets.
Do you think
this is the end of the world?
Oh, Andy, don't be silly.
Do you think the world's gonna end
on your shift?
I've seen you use that smile
on a lot of people. What smile?
The smile you use to reassure people
when everything's gone to shit.
This was the first one to die.
NO ID on her. She just
appeared in the middle of A&E.
Nobody saw her come in,
she didn't register at the desk.
So what happened?
She started coughing up blood.
We moved her into isolation.
An hour later, the staff presented
similar symptoms.
Which were? Bite-like bumps,
chills, fever, headaches, along
with black patches on the skin.
Indicating bleeding into the skin
and possibly other organs.
From the staff, it spread to
patients who'd been in reception.
These aren't contemporary clothes.
Her teeth aren't modern, either.
Shit.
As soon as we realised the rate
of infection, we closed down.
How many others are infected?
30, maybe 40.
All quarantined off?
We think so. Have their clothes
and sheets destroyed.
What is it?
That woman isn't from this century.
More like the 14th.
It's the...it's the fucking...
Black Death, Tosh.
She's infected Cardiff A&E
with the plague...
and it's my fault.
The team
are instigating procedures.
The infected will need 30 milligrams
of Streptomycin and Chloramphenicol
plus two of Tetracycline.
That's plague medicine.
Standard issue for bubonic.
Well done, House.
That's what you're up against.
So what are you gonna do now?
Well, you've got procedures,
haven't you?
Yes, but everybody said Torchwood
would sort it out.
What if we get more carriers
appearing? We're working
to stop that. We waited for you!
You've got to stop this!
You've gotta do something!
No, you've gotta do something.
People are dropping through time
and they'll bring every disease
in history through your doors.
So you'd better be ready. Owen...
You scared enough yet?
Cos fuck knows I am!
Come on, Tosh!
Make sure they get the medicine.
Call us if things get worse.
How much worse can they get?
Owen?
Owen!
Okasan?
SHE SPEAKS IN JAPANESE
TOSH REPLIES IN JAPANESE
Tosh! Come on, stop pissing about.
If Owen managed to open the rift
to get you and Tosh back, can't we
do the same thing for these people?
We've got the rift manipulator.
There's a world of difference.
We're talking about
taking control of time,
not bringing two people back
from the past.
Besides,
look at the damage Owen caused.
We mess with it further,
we'll put the planet in danger.
Have I ever let you down?
Gwen?
Gwen?
'I'm sorry.'
'I'm so sorry.'
Gwen?
Gwen! Come on.
Hustle!
Are you sure it was the same guy?
It was definitely him. Bilis,
the caretaker of the dancehall.
That's all he said, sorry?
What's he got to be sorry for?
Coming through!
WEEVIL GROWLS
13 more reports of Weevils.
We can't keep up at this rate.
Everything's on the increase.
Can you stop them making that noise?
If you've got any ideas how.
Maybe they're time sensitive.
It's too much.
We're now full in all vaults
across all nine levels.
Do you want me to activate
the vaults below? We've never
used them since I've been here.
Do it.
Gwen, maybe you're right. Let's run
a search on your dancehall buddy.
We need to find him. OK.
WEEVIL MOANS
Hello, Ianto.
What do you want? Why are you here?
This isn't happening.
There's only one way to stop this,
before things get worse.
People will die, Ianto.
Thousands of people.
Unless you open the rift.
Owen. How was the hospital?
Laugh a bloody minute. They've
got an outbreak of the Black Death.
What? Oh, my God!
Have they got it under control?
Tosh! How are they coping?
Um, Owen got the place quarantined
and organised treatments for
those who've been infected.
Only consolation is,
it's treatable.
But what happens when
the next carrier comes through, Jack?
Someone carrying smallpox or Ebola,
or something from the future?
What do we do then? Well, it's not
doing us any good speculating.
We need to be prepared.
We're helpless. We're putting
sticking plasters on gaping wounds!
What do you suggest?
I suggest you lead us and you
tell us what the instructions are.
Owen... No, come on.
You're all thinking it too.
You're the big man here.
You keep all the secrets.
Well, now's the time to tell us
how the hell we'll get out of this!
You want to know a secret?
There is no solution.
I can't fix this.
Because this was never
meant to happen.
The first thing you learned
was don't mess with the rift.
But you disobeyed those orders.
And now everything that's happening
is down to you.
I only disobeyed to get you back.
And now people are dying.
So I shouldn't have bothered?
Who the fuck are you, anyway?
Jack Harkness?
You don't even exist.
We've looked.
So if you're not even a real person,
then why should I follow your orders?
Get out. What?
Get out!
I'm relieving you of your duty.
No. You can't do that!
Bollocks, you are! Jack, wait.
You're done here.
What, so that's it?
The whole world is going to shit
and you're going to fire me?
For God's sake! Both of you!
We need to stick together on this.
If I can't rely on you,
if I don't have your complete trust,
you don't belong here.
That goes for the rest of you.
Anyone who agrees with Owen,
leave now.
So now we know how it is.
So that leaves me 24 hours
to savour the good times.
What are you talking about?
Think about it, Gwen.
Nobody leaves this place intact.
Sometime in the next 24 hours...
I get Retconned.
All my memories erased.
I don't know where or when,
but he'll get me.
Jack, this has gone far enough.
So I guess this is goodbye.
Good luck with the end of the world.
I would say thanks for the
memories... Jack, for God's sake!
'OK, guys, Bilis's shop is
coming up 20 metres on your left'.
Wow.
Some of this stuff
must go back centuries.
He scavenges antique pieces
from the past, brings them here,
sells them for a profit.
Not a bad business plan.
We all have to earn a living.
You're from 1941.
As you were. Hello, again.
How can you be
in two time zones at once?
I can step across eras,
like you'd walk into another room.
At first, it was the most incredible
gift. Now I know the reality...
it's a curse.
Why?
I can see the whole of history,
but I don't belong anywhere
within it.
So, your return to this time
had a price.
Time's splintering.
This city exists on a rift in time.
The only way to make it right
is to fully open that rift -
let it suck back what fell through.
No way. It's too dangerous.
Can we even do that?
Of course you can.
Isn't that right, Captain?
Jack? You've seen what happened.
If we open that rift fully,
millions of lives will be at risk.
And yet, if you don't,
more will fall through.
Lives will be lost.
You know so much, you're coming
back with us. I'm sorry.
Damn it! Trace the temporal
activity around this location.
We need to find out where he is.
Come on.
CLOCKS CHIME
Gwen.
I am not your enemy.
In the cells,
why did you say you were sorry?
Sometimes it's better
to live in ignorance...unless...
Do you really want to know?
Know what?
Hold my hands. I'll show you.
OK.
Only if you're sure.
I'm sure.
I'm sorry!
What did you just show me?
The future.
What took you so long? Gwen?
Gwen!
Is that you?
Yeah... It's me.
Ah! You're cleaning the oven!
Aye, somebody got to, love.
Listen, we gotta go.
Why, what's happened? We've gotta go.
Let me finish here first...
Rhys, we've gotta go. Now!
Aw, here we go again, always a hurry
since you started that bloody job...
I'm sorry.
(Owen.)
Owen.
Oh...Jesus.
Diane...
Oh, Jesus.
I'm lost, Owen.
I can touch you. I don't understand.
Where did you end up? Please.
Bring me back, Owen. You can
do that, can't you? I don't know.
Everything's out of sync. Please.
Please bring me back.
Open the rift.
Do you want another drink there,
mate?
# Can it call you or maul you
# And drive you insane
# Can it make you remember
# Time is in place
# Now I'm begging you
# I'm begging you... #
Take it easy. What's going on?
Am I dreaming?
This is where I work.
You work in a prison?
These are just the cells.
You locked me in a cell?
What the hell are you playing at?
I was just trying to keep you safe.
I was safe at home! No, you weren't.
You really weren't. Listen, Gwen,
you'd better tell me
exactly what's going on
cos I've taken some shit
over the past few months.
What's all this? Rhys, listen to me,
I need you to trust me.
OK, it may not seem like it
at the moment,
but I'm just trying
to take care of you.
I love you, sweetheart.
LOUD MOAN FROM ABOVE
What the hell was that?
Just try and relax
and I'll come back for you.
What do you mean? You're not
going to leave me down here!
I'm sorry. Gwen! Gwen! I'm sorry.
Shit!
Did he wake up? Yeah. Yeah, he did.
Tosh, can you bring up the CCTV
of the vaults?
Er, just leave it on the screen,
I know it sounds crazy, but...
Sure, no problem. Thank you...
for helping me bring him here.
I can't understand how Bilis
was able to show you that vision.
It was so real, Tosh.
I was in my flat.
It smelt like my flat,
it had all the sounds of my flat.
I touched the blood. I can still
feel it on my hands. Rhys's blood.
Not gonna happen.
Come on,
there's still work to be done.
What's going on?
We've got a security breach.
All right, nobody panic.
RHYS!
KLAXON SOUNDS
Oh, do you work here?
I'm Rhys...
..Gwen's boyfriend.
RHYS GROANS
NO!
No!
He's gone! He's gone! Please...
No! Please!
No!
We can...we can bring him back!
There's nothing we can do.
Yes, there is! My boy.
What am I going to do?
What am I going to do?
SHE SCREAMS
No!
No!
GWEN'S SCREAMS ECHO
I'll have to tell his family.
We'll deal with it.
The way you dealt with that porter
the first time I met you?
No, you won't deal with him, Ianto.
Gwen, I'm so sorry.
You never even met him.
This is what happens here.
We all end up alone.
Not me.
No way.
You bring him back. No.
The resurrection gauntlet...
Was destroyed. Something else.
I said no.
No, there's something wrong
with time, so we, we can go back
to the moment, to the very moment...
Gwen... There's something
you can do, otherwise
WHAT'S THE FUCKING POINT OF YOU?!
You, you bring him back!
Bring him back!
You bring him back!
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME,
JACK FUCKING HARKNESS?
I'm sorry. Do you? I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh, shit.
What happened?
You came back! Are you all right?
You OK? You all right?
Don't touch me!
How many other people
have got to suffer?
I'm gonna fix this.
I'm opening the rift.
Make sure you stop him.
No.
We're gonna help him.
Bilis was right,
he said open the rift
and everything goes back to normal.
Owen's right.
I'm going to get Rhys back.
Gwen. No! Gwen!
Enter Emergency Protocol One.
Out the way, I'll do this.
ALARM SOUNDS
Get away from the computer,
Gwen. Jack... This is a trap.
All the cracks, they're diversions.
This is what Bilis wants.
What are you afraid of, Jack?
Rhea Silva.
I said, "Move."
What the hell are you doing?!
Final warning.
Come on, Jack.
You're a united front now?
Toshiko, the poor girl
who'll screw any passing alien
that gives her a pendant?
Owen, so strong,
he gets in a cage with a Weevil,
desperate to be mauled.
Or Ianto, hiding his
cyber-girlfriend in the basement.
Your three comrades here
pumped bullets into her, remember?
I've got to get Rhys back.
Yeah, cos you're so in love
with Rhys that you spend
half your time in Owen's bed.
Fuck you! We're relieving you
of your command, "Captain".
We're getting back what we lost!
Shit!
Stay down!
You're in charge, Owen? You've gotta
have significantly bigger balls.
I'm sick of people doubting me.
What have you done?
We've still got to do Jack's.
KLAXON BLARES
SOLDIER SHOUTS
GWEN SCREAMS
Oh, my God!
What have you done?
Help me move him!
Keep moving!
It's going to be all right, Jack.
Everything is going to go
back to normal.
From out of the darkness,
he is come.
What is he talking about?
Son of the Great Beast,
cast out before time,
chained in rock
and imprisoned beneath the rift.
What?!
All hail Abaddon,
the Great Devourer.
Come to feast on life.
BEAST ROARS
CAR ALARMS BLARE
The whole world shall die
beneath his shadow.
PEOPLE SCREAM
I look upon you, my God,
and know my work is done.
How do we stop it?
Tell me what to do, Jack.
Just you...
Get me to an open space.
What are you gonna do?
If Abaddon is the bringer of death,
let's see how he does with me.
If he feeds on life,
then I'm an all-you-can-eat buffet.
No, wait! Wait, you're too weak!
Get out of here!
GO!
Drive as fast as you can. Jack!
Bring it on!
ABADDON ROARS
JACK SCREAMS
GWEN SOBS
You're here! Weren't you just
here a minute ago? You're here!
Go to bed. Get some sleep...
and I'll be back for you.
You're certain?
He's ice cold.
No vital signs.
He survived when you shot him.
When I first joined,
he said he couldn't die.
He was wrong.
I want to sit with him.
Gwen...
I want to sit with him.
(Wake up.)
(Jack.)
How long's she gonna do this?
It's been days.
We have to face up to it.
He's not coming back.
I believe in him.
Let him go, Gwen.
JACK: Thank you.
I... I forgive you.
OWEN SOBS
What's happened to the rift?
It closed up
when Abaddon was destroyed.
But it's gonna be
more volatile than ever.
The visions we had.
We all saw people we loved.
What did you see?
Nothing.
There was nothing.
Jack...
what would have tempted you?
What visions would have
convinced you to open the rift?
The right kind of Doctor.
Jack...?
Where are they with those coffees?
MACHINE BEEPS
Jack?
TARDIS THRUMS
Jack?
DOOR OPENS
Did you see Jack
on your way in? No.
I thought we'd tidied up in here!
What's the matter?
Um...he was just here.
Something's taken him. Jack's gone.
'Scuse me,
have you seen a blowfish
driving a sports car?
Thank you!
Bloody Torchwood!
<i>Species not on record,</i>
DNA-type says some sort of land fish.
All I'm saying is, you are speeding
and there are children.
Kids out at midnight,
they've got it coming.
Detecting high levels of algae.
Who's afraid of the big scary fish?
Big fish with a gun.
- Special weapons?
- Not that I can see.
Do we need special weapons?
What are we gonna
do when we catch it?
- Jack would know.
- Well, ]ack's not here, is he?
]ack's disappeared!
Fat lot of good jack is!
Blowfish!!
Hold on!
- Hold the wheel.
- Don't you dare, Owen!
Hold the wheel!
Right, got it.
Where is it, where's it gone?
Go! Go! Go!
Gwen, go left, Tosh go right,
Ianto take centre.
Positions!
Massive levels of adrenalin.
Mixed with approximately
three grams of cocaine.
This fish is wired.
So, this is Team Torchwood.
The teacher's pets.
But teacher's gone, hasn't he?
Leaving the kiddy-kids all alone.
And look at you,
trying so hard to be all grown up.
The Doctor,
with his hands full of blood.
The CMM,
with her oh-so-beating heart.
The Technician,
with her cold devices.
Which leaves me, with the Office Boy,
promoted beyond his measure.
All of you,
lost without your master.
All of you,
pretending to be so brave.
All of you, so scared.
Ha ha ha!
So, what about it, minion?
Can you do it?
How good are you?
How sharp is your aim?
What if you kill her?
What if I kill her first?
Can you shoot, before I do?
Can you?
Dare you?
Would you?
Won't you?
Hey kids.
Did you miss me?

<i>Are you sure no more
like him came through?</i>
Cross-referencing with the
rift activity monitor,
doesn't look like it.
The car's impounded,  I'll get it
back to the owner in the morning.
- How you doing?
- Bio-profile's on screen.
Nothing in his genetic make-up
to contaminate the city.
Ok, Tosh, can you add that
to the species database?
- Ianto?
- Hello!
Sorry, can you deal with
the body when it's cold?
My pleasure and I'll make sushi.
No, the morgue and
I'll do fine, thank you.
Got pretty organised without me.
Yeah, well we had to.
I Did you decorate in here?
You left us, Jack!
- I know. I'm sorry.
- We knew nothing, Jack.
Where were you?
I found my Doctor.
- Did he fix you?
- What's to fix?
You don't mess with
this level of perfection!
Are you going back to him?
I came back for you.
All of you.
Rift activity!
<i>Get off, I didn't do it.</i>
<i>Please, leave me alone.</i>
<i>Duh...</i>
Help me!
Come any closer and
I'll open up his neck!
- Fine!
- What?!
Which artery do you normally sever?
- No.
- I'm not bluffing!
Well, see now you've
given yourself away.
Only someone who's bluffing
ever says they're not.
Oh, God!
Shit! Please, please stop!
Well...
No.
He's dead.
Please...
I...
was never here.
Go.
Thirsty now.
All right!
Now...
You... go.
You go.
You go.
You stay.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Stay.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Oh...
Stay, stay, stay.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Go.
The rest of you, go.
I'll take one of everything.
Any questions?
All right, mate,
let's take it outside.
Oh.
Did I mention I'm armed?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Fragments of rift energy, around
the neck, arm and shoulders.
He was grabbed... and pushed.
Explains the residual energy cluster
How did you ever manage without me?
So, there's a killer on the loose.
Bipedal, maybe humanoid.
Any other alien tech involved, Tosh?
No readings to suggest that.
Ok, let's get back and see what
we can piece together.
Technology gain you?
I was hoping for a power struggle,
resolved by some naked wrestling.
Thank you, Andy.
You can let SOCO in now, they can
eliminate us from whatever they want.
This another one of your spooky-dos?
Not yet, but I'll let you know.
"Thanks, Andy.
You've been very helpful."
Don't mention it, Gwen.
Whoa, that never beeps.
That's what I was thinking.
<i>I can't believe I got
the answer machine!</i>
<i>What can you be doing that's
more important than me?</i>
<i>Anyway, you've probably traced
the energy shift, found the body.</i>
<i>All me, sorry about the mess.</i>
<i>Bill me for the clean-up.</i>
<i>Now, drinks!</i>
<i>Retrolock the transmission coordinates,
that's where I am.</i>
<i>And hurry up, work to do!</i>
<i>Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi,
you're my only hope!</i>
Stay here. Don't come after me.
- Who was that?
- Stay here.
Hey, Jack! Wait!
See that! He swans back in
and then he shuts us right out.
- I'm not having this.
- I can track him.
Taxi!

<i>Reports of a bar disturbance,</i>
same coordinates as the SUV.
Tell the police we're dealing with it.
Ok, so, who the hell was
the bloke in the hologram?
Jack recognised him.
Why didn't he let us go with him?
It's typical Jack, he disappears,
he comes back, then he runs away again.
We don't even know his real name.
Or which time he comes from.
He's supposed to be our boss,
we know nothing about him.
It drives me crazy!
It is more fun when
he's around, though.
- Yeah.
- Definitely!
Yeah, it is!
- You're putting on weight?
- You're losing your hair?
What are you wearing?
Captain Jack Harkness,
note the stripes.
Captain John Hart,
note the sarcasm.
I worked my way up
through the ranks.
I bet the ranks were very grateful.
I need a drink.
I thought you'd never ask.
So, how was rehab?
Rehabs. Plural.
- Drink, drugs, sex and...
- Murder.
Ha ha!
You went to murder rehab?
I know, ridiculous.
The odd kill, who does it hurt?
You clean now?
Kicked everything.
Living like a priest.
So, how's the Time Agency?
You didn't hear?
Shut down.
You're kidding.
No. There's only seven of us left now.
Wow.
It's good to see you.
It was never the same without you.
You need to go.
I don't want you on my territory.
What?
Time was, you couldn't get enough
of me on your "territory".
All right, everybody out!
Everything all right, Jack?
It's ok, ok, ok.
You've got a team!
How sweet!
Oh, pretty little friends!
No blonde, though.
You need a blonde.
- God, he's worse than Jack.
- Oh, do you have a team name?
I love team names, go on!
Torchwood.
Oh. Not Excalibur?
Blizzard? Bikini Cops? No?
Torchwood. Oh, dear.
Gwen Cooper, Ianto Jones,
Toshiko Sato, Owen Harper,
- meet...
- Captain John Hart.
- We go back.
- Excuse me. We more than go back.
We were partners.
- In what way?
- In every way.
And then some.
It was two weeks.
Except that two weeks was
trapped in a time loop,
so we were together for five years,
it was like having a wife.
- You were the wife.
- YOU were the wife.
- No, YOU were the wife.
- Oh, but I was a good wife.
I bet you were.
What?
Don't pretend you
haven't noticed, he's cute.
They're just shy.
What are you doing here?
I was wondering when I we'd get to that.
- That's the same as yours.
- A little smaller.
But lasts much longer.
Get two Time Agents
in the same room together,
it's always about the
size of the wrist strap.
Yes, sorry, what's a Time Agent?
What, he's never told
you about his past?
No, he hasn't.
Anyway...
I'm working with this woman,
beautiful,
clever, sexy, yadda yadda yadda,
and we both get shot.
And as she's dying, she begs me.
She tells me about these radiation
cluster bombs she'd been working on.
I don't like the sound of that.
Three canisters,
contents beyond toxic,
swallowed up in a riftstorm.
- And ended up here.
- Bingo.
That's the downside of your city being
built on a rift in space and time.
Now, left to their own devices,
the radiation will break
down the canisters
and then infect your people and planet.
They need to be neutralised.
What do you get out of this?
Dying woman's wish.
Now, there's only one problem.
I don't know where they are.
I Hoping local knowledge might help.
When we get back to the Hub,
I can run a citywide scan
on radiation surges
and cross reference that with the
rift activity during that time span.
What are you,
the brains and the beauty?
You see, together it's an easy job.
We do this,
you get of here when its finished.
Right away.
Does this mean I get to see your house?
You live in a sculpture?
Could you be any more pretentious?
Get on.
So, your team not allowed in this way?
This is the entrance for tourists.
I remember the last time you said that.
Where the hell...
It's roomy,
I'll give you that.
Your taste in interior design
hasn't got any better, though.
What is this, sewer chic?
Weapons.
And the rest.
Oh, you know me,
I'm a two-weapon man.
One pistol strapped to each leg,
laser knife beneath left elbow,
17 small explosive charges
in the lining of his coat.
I Slipped my mind.
He's a compulsive liar!
Why is he in the building?
There's a tiny 1% chance,
he's breaking a habit of a lifetime,
and telling the truth.
Which means this city is in danger.
What did he mean by a Time Agent?
You've never mentioned it.
That was in the past.
Oh, here we go again.
You know everything about me, Jack.
Why d'you keep shutting me out?
Here and now,
that's what's important.
The work we do, the person I am now.
- That's what I'm proud of.
- Then why did you desert us?
Where did you go?
No, no, come on, where did you go?
Tell me.
Talk to me.
I have died so many times.
Been dragged back into life,
like being hauled over broken glass.
I saw the end of the world.
- How?
- Doesn't matter now.
But after it was all over...
...I knew I belong here.
What kept me fighting was the
thought of coming home to you.
- What's this?
- TMS.
That's an engagement ring, that is.
- You're getting married?
- Yes.
Rhys asked.
When you were away.
Wow! Gwen Cooper getting married.
Down on one knee?
He tried to, he had a twinge in his
back and had to lie on the settee,
and he popped the question.
- And you said yes.
- Well, no-one else will have me.
Good for you.
- We should get back to work.
- Mm-hm.
Seven hours ago we logged
a minor surge in rift energy,
across three locations.
Six of us, three locations, simple.
Two people per canister.
Excuse me, I give the orders.
Well, give some, big boy!
John's right. Sorry, erm,
d'you prefer John, or Captain?
With eyes like yours,
call me Vera, I won't complain.
Tosh and Owen, take the north.
Ianto and jack go west.
Me and Vera'll take the docks.
Excuse me, not to repeat myself.
Got a problem with this, Jack?
Not at all.
Now, given the canisters are
radioactive, don't open them, eh?
Let's go, guys.
Gwen, I need a word.
Oh, can I watch?
He's gonna give you all the
dos and don'ts. I love it.
She'll be with you in a second.
What the hell are you doing?
If I can get him talking, flirt a bit,
he might drop his guard.
I can find out what he's really upto.
- OK, clever.
- Thank you.
But dangerous, leave it to me.
I led the team while you were
away, Jack. I can handle this.
He knows you too well,
he'll never tell you the truth.
Three rules.
One: don't believe anything he says.
Two: always keep him in front of you.
And three:
under no circumstances let him kiss you.
As if I would!
Has he gone to  the no-kissing rule yet?
<i>He only invented that because
he wants me all to himself.</i>
Keep infront.
Nothing.
Are you sure this is the right spot?
Yeah. But containers
get shifted all the time.
This could take days.
So, that woman,
the one with the canister,
how did you get to know her again?
We were in love.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Did they catch the person who shot her?
Do we have to talk about this?
No, no, of course not.
Don't mind me.
- Shouldn't you be asleep?
- I got it!
<i>Sorry?</i>
Manager at Hanovoods!
<i>The letter was on the mat!</i>
I got the bloody job!
Oh, my God! Rhys, that is fantastic!
Baby, you're fantastic too.
Yeah, just there!
- Who's that?
- It's some...
idiot I work with that's all.
<i>I don't suppose there's any chance
of me seeing you before breakfast?</i>
It looks like it's gonna be an
all-nighter. So, get yourself to bed.
I am so proud of you.
<i>I love you.</i>
Yeah, well, I love you more.
John?
John?
John!
- John!!
- Worried you'd lost me?
Whoa. Little bit jumpy there?
Keep in front of me, OK?
God, you're so untrusting.
But with your boss it's probably wise.
Yeah, I trust him just fine,
thank you.
Once a conman, always a conman.
What do you mean by that?
Look, just don't rely on him, Gwen.
There's a lot about him you don't know.
Fancy a peek?
Aha!
Is that it?
What are you doing?!
Get off me!
Celebrating,
that's all.
God, the 21st century is so frigid!
What've you done?
Don't get up.
I mean, you can't anyway.
Paralysing lip gloss.
I think it might have even been
Jack taught me that trick.
Just one problem,
if you're not found in two hours,
your major organs will go into shutdown.
Thanks.
<i>You gonna be OK in here without me?</i>
He won't stay with you.
He and I shared something.
No bulbs.
No, cos that would only be helpful.
Oh, great, how are we gonna find
a canister in all this tut?
What are we doing with our lives, Tosh?
I know,
we should be out having fun!
Bet you'd normally be out
on the pull, this time of night.
Oh, no, bollocks to that, Tosh.
Talk about diminishing returns.
Not with you.
Well, you know,
I've done all that, aren't I?
Where did it get me?
No, you know, I need...
a proper woman, you know.
Someone I've got something
in common with, you know.
Got anyone on the horizon?
Like you say,
difficult to meet anyone
I've got anything in common with.
What with the things we see.
You beauty!
Yes!
Job done!
Good work, team!
Where's Gwen?
Ah ah ah!
Gun on the floor.
Or I shoot her.
- Jack, where are you?
- I muted the comms system,
as soon as we left
the palace under the pavement.
I love my little wrist strap.
Now...
Phones.
You touch her again,
and I will kill you. OK?
The efficiency of a gun,
or the brutality of wood?
Yeah, look, stop toying with me
and get on with it.
Oh, yeah!
Loving that officy feel!
I always get excited in these places.
To me, they're exotic.
Office romances...
photocopying your butt...
or maybe not your butt,
although as we're here...
The rift was active at these coordinates
200 feet above ground.
That means this floor...
or the roof.
How are you, Ianto?
All the better for having.
You back, sir.
Can we maybe drop the sir, now?
While I was away, I was thinking...
Maybe we could,
when this is all done...
Dinner? A movie?
Are you asking me out on a date?
Interested?
Well...
As...
long as it's not in an office.
Some fetishes should
I be kept to you sir.
Looks like we're gonna have
to go through every drawer,
bin and plant pot.
Right. OK.
I'll do this floor, don't want
you getting overexcited,
and you take the roof.
You're good on roofs.
Jack?
Why are we helping him?
He's a reminder of my past.
I want him gone.
By the way...
- Was that a yes?
- Yes!
Into the lift, eye candy.
Your friends are bleeding,
and dying.
You barely have enough
time to save them.
Owen? Gwen?
What am I, a child?
It's primitive technology,
easily blocked,
you should be embarrassed.
And when you get to the bottom, run.
You look like a man who enjoys a
challenge, see if you can save them.
Come back up here,
I'll shoot on sight.
<i>Going down.</i>
Going down!
Yes, please.
Why are you doing this?
We're a cosmic joke, eye candy.
An accident of chemicals
and evolution.
The jokes, the sex,
just cover the fact that
nothing means anything.
And the only consolation, is money.
So run, Ianto Jones!
<i>Going down.</i>
<i>Doors closing.</i>
Rear of the Year,
5094.
Still looking good.
Cute boy, ringing to
warn you about me.
Canister.
- If you've harmed them...
- They're pretty, but stupid.
You used to have better taste.
Doesn't look like that from here.
Just give it here.
Radiation cluster bombs? Really?
Let's not get hung up on details.
Little embarrassing that
you needed help to find them.
A little humiliated
you fell for the scam.
Your dolly birds did all my leg I work.
Is that what you wanted?
What I want is for you
to come to your senses.
Join me, Jack.
Back in the old routine.
We'd be emperors.
How can you stay tied to one planet
when there's thousands of worlds,
sparkling with wonder?
We should be up there,
among the stars,
claiming them for our own.
Just like before.
- I can't.
- Why not?
What the hell is there
to keep you here?
Come on.
The glitter of the galaxy.
The mischief we could make.
Y'know, you never really
mastered that temptation spiel.
It's not a spiel. It's fact.
Move on.
Here I am,
in a new life and you're still churning
out the same old tunes.
And sorry, but they don't play as well,
now you're looking a little older.
What are they, wrinkles
around your eyes?
Laugh lines.
Oh, hell of a good joke.
It's you I'm laughing at. Canister.
Whoops.
Ha ha ha!
Whoops.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.
Why didn't he just kill us?
He got what he wanted.
But maybe he just underestimated us.
<i>Tosh! Owen!</i>
Ianto!
<i>Tosh!</i>
We're over here.
- What happened?
- Where's Gwen?
- Have you heard from Gwen?
- No.
Rehab...
didn't really work.
Front door key.
Thanks.
If she's in one of these, we'll
never find her, there's too many!
Just keep looking!
God, I need more painkillers!
I'll try her phone again.
Over here!
- She must've dropped it.
- Gwen!
Gwen!
Unless it's another of
Captain John's tricks.
- What're you doing?
- If Gwen used the phone here,
I can use the network to
triangulate the location.
where she answered her last call.
Got it!
This is where she made the call.
Open every container door!
<i>She's in here!</i>
Gwen, it's all right.
We're here with you.
What happened?
What's he done to her?
She's still breathing,
no discernible injuries.
- Tosh, let's get this thing started.
- Ianto, take a swab.
Right, pupils dilating,
she's still conscious.
Stay with us, darling.
He's poisoned her.
Anti-toxin kit now!
Gwen, hold on.
Had to go and steal a car.
Get yourself noticed.
Now...
OK...
Pretty and resilient.
Is that even fair?
Maybe you didn't realise.
You can beat, shoot, threaten,
and even poison us,
and we keep coming back.
Stronger every time.
Well, I think you ought to know,
your boss is splayed out on the...
Pavement.
Now that's impressive.
Seriously, you can earn...
a fortune in the Vegas galaxies
with an act like that.
Go on, how's it work?
I can't die.
Huh...
- No but, really...
- No, but really, you can't kill me.
No matter how many times you try.
I can't die.
Ever.
But what does it cost you?
Every time you have to drag yourself
back here, how does it feel?
All... that pain and trauma.
Plus, you're reborn into
this godforsaken mess.
I pity you.
These people,
this planet,
all the beauty you could never see.
That's what I come back for.
Well, goody on you.
What's in the canisters?
It's come clean time, Captain.
Yeah, all right.
That woman I told you about,
had herself an Arcadian diamond,
the rarest gem in the Damascene Cluster.
Just when I'd got my hands on her,
she only generates her
own personal riftstorm.
God, I hate technological geniuses.
You said this was a
dying woman's request.
Yeah, she was dying. I shot her.
Thought my luck had changed
when I found it had ended up here.
So, I'm thinking 50/50?
Even split, good deal.
Or if anyone fancies an orgy?
- Open it.
- What, not even a please?
Don't your manners get
brought back to life too?
Now!
This should give us
the location of the diamond.
There she is.
The woman you murdered.
<i>You've travelled several
galaxies for this.</i>
<i>Well done.</i>
Thank you, gorgeous.
<i>Except...</i>
<i>There's no diamond.</i>
What?
<i>Only this.</i>
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, ...
It's got to be a diamond.
It's all about the diamond!
What the hell is that...
<i>It's an explosive device,</i>
<i>which will latch on to the
DNA of whoever killed me.</i>
<i>It'll detonate in ten minutes.</i>
<i>It can't be removed
without exploding, so...</i>
<i>don't bother trying.</i>
<i>Goodbye... lover.</i>
- No Wait.
- See you in hell!
She can't be serious. Ten minutes.
Get it of me!
Actually, nine minutes 50, 49, 48...
Always at the ready!
OK, how big is this
explosion likely to be, Jack?
That technology, that size... big.
So, we should get him out of the city.
Nine minutes 37.
You've got to help me! Please.
Why?
Let her go.
Jack, help me!
Get back!
What've you done?!
It's hypersteel, impermeable,
deadlock sealed.
No way to undo them.
Unless you have this key.
You are UNBELIEVABLE!
And yet, you still find
me strangely attractive.
Now YOU had better find a solution
pronto or she'll be blown up with me!
Would shooting him stop the DNA trigger?
No.
So, what are we gonna do now, team?
The orgy's still on offer by the way.
- Especially now the cuffs are out.
- Nine minutes, four seconds.
Tosh, the rift predictor program,
have you perfected yet?
- Pretty much.
- What?
- Anything in the next few minutes?
- Gwen, no way.
What's she talking about?
If we're in the rift
when that disc explodes,
the city will be safe.
- How does that save us?
- It doesn't.
Eight 32, 31...
- You're bluffing.
- Try me.
The car park where he arrived.
The crack in the rift is
still active up there.
That's where we're going.
Somebody better
start doing something.
- Cut his hand off.
- That would activate the bomb.
Don't make me pull you!
Get up the stairs, now!
Five minutes 22.
I can't find the frequency
the device works on.
There's no chance of jamming it!
Where's Jack? He should be here.
What I've been saying
all along, unreliable.
Shut up!
I think I'm starting to see
what he likes about this place.
She's beautiful, he's stunning.
Don't you ever stop?
What five minutes to live,
you want me to behave.
- Oh, that's gorgeous.
- That's a poodle.
That's nice.
- This better work.
- Trust me, I'm an improviser.
Out!
- Ok.
- Get out!
I do love a woman who's rough.
51 seconds.
You're not really gonna
sacrifice yourself, are you?
45 seconds.
We have to go.
No! What about a last-minute rescue?
Why be on a team if you
don't get a last-minute rescue!
40 seconds.
Tell...
Tell Jack...
Tell Jack I...
<i>30 seconds.</i>
Now what's he doing?
Get off me!
Owen, it's not working.
15 seconds!
- What are you doing?!
- Trying to confuse the disc!
- Why hasn't it worked?
- I don't know!
- 12 seconds!
- Jack, do something!
I've gotta go, Jack.
<i>Five...</i>
<i>Four...</i>
Three...
<i>Two...</i>
<i>One!</i>
<i>Go!</i>
<i>Run!</i>
What the hell?
Jack, what's going on?
Why's it gone dark?
The rift's reverted to
the moment he came through.
Everything's jumped back to
the beginning of the night.
Like you were never here.
Now we've got to avoid ourselves, great!
It's a temporal displacement!
Makes your tongue tingle, doesn't it?
Lovely!
What was in the syringe?
Torchwood DNA.
What?
DNA samples from the five of us,
fused and injected into his heart.
Temporarily corrupted his DNA coding,
confused the disc.
You mean, there's a bit
of all of you inside of me?
Sweet goddesses, that's all I need.
Thank you, Owen.
- You're welcome.
- I want you gone.
Well, we've got to work out
a way to get these off first.
Actually...
Old Artesian trick.
Keep it in the lining of the throat.
Has a lot of uses.
- You had that all along?
- You were my passport to survival.
No hard feelings.
Well, not in that sense.
Remind me never to
get on your bad side.
Definitely bigger.
- If you need a new team member...
- No.
- Really? I could...
- No.
- But...
- No.
Go now, and you can harness
the residual rift energy.
- Listen...
- Goodbye.
OK.
Oh!
By the way...
I meant to tell you...
I found Gray.
Who's Gray?
It's nothing.
Let's get back to work.
<i>Have you never seen something so mad,
so extraordinary,</i>
<i>that just for one second you think that
there might be more out there?</i>
<i>Who are you people?</i>
You're Torchwood, yes?
There's a rift through space
and time that runs through Cardiff,
stuff slips through from other times
and planets and we monitor it.
Stop wasting our time,
we know you're an alien.
There's no such thing as aliens.
Get away from me!
What is it, not spooky enough?
Honestly, it's just sex, sex,
sex with you people.
You have picked the
wrong girl to stalk, mate.
When are the others coming?
<i>They're already here.</i>
<i>Oh my God!</i>
<i>Welcome to Planet Earth.</i>
- Who the hell is this?
- Miss Martha Jones.
A human being who's
travelled in time and space.
You really are something special.
What's happening?
I don't know.
Toshiko, show me the city now.
They're everywhere.
<i>You're the only one who can stop this.</i>
<i>If you don't it's the end of everything.</i>
<i>You always remember what you killed.</i>
Alien Jack?
Nuclear warheads, ten of them.
It's all over.
Let's all have sex.
And I thought the end of the
world couldn't get any worse.
<i>Come on what do we do?</i>
Just keep watching.
Keep doing what we do.

Excusez-moi,
avez-vous vu un poisson Globe
conduisant une voiture de sport ?
Merci !
Fichu Torchwood !
<i>Espèce non identifiée</i>
D'après son ADN, c'est une
sorte de poisson de Terre.
Tu devrais ralentir, il y a des enfants.
Dehors à cette heure là,
ils l'auront bien cherché.
Hauts niveaux d'algues détectés.
Qui a peur du grand méchant poisson ?
Grand poisson armé.
- Armes spéciales ?
- Pas que je sache.
On a besoin d'armes spéciales ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on fera
quand on l'aura attrapé ?
- Jack le saurait.
- Mais Jack n'est pas là, si ?
Jack a disparu ! Mais Jack est super !
Poisson Globe !
Accrochez-vous !
- Tiens le volant.
- Pas question, Owen !
Tiens le volant !
D'accord.
Où il est ? Où il est passé ?
En avant !
Gwen, à gauche. Tosh à
droite. Ianto, au centre.
En position !
Enorme taux d'adrénaline.
Mélangé avec environ
trois grammes de cocaïne.
Ce poisson est défoncé.
Voilà Torchwood.
Les chouchous du prof.
Mais il est parti, non ?
Laissant les petits tous seuls.
Et regardez-vous,
essayant désespérément
de jouer les grands.
Le docteur, les mains pleines de sang.
La chargée des relations
humaines, le coeur battant.
La technicienne, ses
froids appareils en main.
Et il me reste le secrétaire,
promu au-delà de ses compétences.
Vous tous, perdus sans votre maître.
Vous tous, prétendant être braves.
Vous tous, tellement apeurés.
Ah ah ah !
Alors, mon mignon ?
Tu peux le faire ? Es-tu assez bon ?
Ta visée est-elle assez précise ?
Et si tu la tuais ?
Et si je la tuais en premier ?
Peux-tu tirer avant moi ?
Le peux-tu ?
Oserais-tu ?
Le veux-tu ?
Le feras-tu ?
Salut les enfants.
Je vous ai manqué ?

<i>Il est bien le seul à être passé ?</i>
D'après le moniteur
d'activité de la brèche,
on ne dirait pas.
C'était une voiture volée,
je la ramènerai demain matin.
- T'en es où ?
- Je fais son profil bio.
Rien dans son corps
pouvant contaminer la ville.
Tosh, tu peux l'ajouter
à la liste des espèces ?
- Ianto ?
- C'est moi !
Tu pourras t'occuper du
corps une fois refroidi ?
Avec plaisir, et j'amène des sushis.
La morgue suffira, merci.
Vous vous êtes bien organisés sans moi.
Il a bien fallu.
Vous avez redécoré ?
Tu nous as laissés, Jack !
- Je sais, désolé.
- On ne savait rien.
Où étais-tu ?
J'ai trouvé mon docteur.
- Il t'a guéri ?
- Me guérir de quoi ?
A ce niveau de perfection, rien à faire.
Vous retournez avec lui ?
Je suis revenu pour toi.
Et pour vous tous.
La brèche s'anime.
<i>Lâche-moi, j'ai rien fait.</i>
<i>Laisse-moi tranquille.</i>
Aidez-moi !
Approche et je lui tranche la gorge.
- Bien !
- Quoi ?
Quelle artère tu sectionnes d'habitude ?
- Non !
- Je bluffe pas.
Voilà, tu t'es vendu.
Seul quelqu'un qui bluffe s'en défend.
Oh mon dieu !
Bon sang ! Je t'en prie, non !
Eh bien...
Non.
Il est mort.
S'il vous plaît...
Je...
n'ai jamais été là.
Dégage.
Maintenant, j'ai soif.
Bien !
Alors...
Toi... dehors.
Dehors.
Dehors.
Toi, reste.
Dehors.
Dehors.
Dehors.
Reste.
Dehors.
Dehors.
Dehors.
Dehors.
Dehors.
Restez, restez, restez.
Dehors.
Dehors.
Dehors.
Dehors.
Dehors.
Tous les autres, dehors.
J'en prend un de chaque.
Des questions ?
D'accord, mon gars. Réglons ça dehors.
Je vous ai dit que j'étais armé ?
Fragments d'énergie autour du
cou, des bras et des épaules.
Il a été attrapé, puis poussé.
Ca explique les résidus énergétiques.
Comment avez-vous fait sans moi ?
Bien, on a un tueur qui rôde.
Bipède, peut-être humanoïde.
D'autres technologies
extraterrestres, Tosh ?
Pas que je sache.
Rentrons voir ce qu'on peut en tirer.
Tu reprends les choses en main ?
J'espérais une lutte de pouvoir,
résolue par un combat dénudé.
Merci, Andy.
Fais entrer SOCO, qu'ils nous
éliminent de tout ce qu'ils veulent.
Encore un de vos cas surnaturels ?
Pas encore, mais je te tiens au courant.
"Merci Andy, tu as
été d'une grande aide."
C'est rien, Gwen.
Ce truc ne bipe jamais.
C'est ce que je me disais.
<i>J'en reviens pas de
tomber sur le répondeur !</i>
<i>Qu'y a-t'il de plus
important que moi ?</i>
<i>Tu as dû retracer le flux
d'énergie, trouver le corps.</i>
<i>C'est tout moi, désolé pour tout ça.</i>
<i>Envoie-moi la note.</i>
<i>Maintenant, à boire !</i>
<i>Inverse les coordonnées,
et tu me trouveras.</i>
<i>Et dépêche-toi, y'a du boulot !</i>
<i>Aidez-moi, Obi-Wan Kenobi,
vous êtes mon seul espoir !</i>
Restez là. Ne me suivez pas.
- C'était qui ?
- Restez ici.
Jack, attends !
Il revient comme si de rien
était et nous met direct de côté.
Je peux le filer !
Taxi !
<i>Grabuge dans un bar signalé.</i>
Mêmes coordonnées que le SUV.
Dis à la police qu'on s'en occupe.
Qui était ce mec dans l'hologramme ?
Jack l'a reconnu.
Pourquoi il a pas voulu qu'on vienne ?
C'est tout Jack, il disparaît,
revient, puis s'enfuit à nouveau.
On ne connaît même pas son vrai nom.
Ou de quelle époque il vient.
C'est censé être notre patron,
et on ne sait rien de lui.
Ca me rend dingue !
Mais c'est plus drôle quand il est là.
Ouais, c'est sûr !
Totalement !
- Tu prends du poids ?
- Tu perds tes cheveux ?
Qu'est-ce que tu portes ?
Capitaine Jack Harkness,
tu remarqueras les galons.
Capitaine John Hart, tu
remarqueras le sarcasme.
J'ai gravi les échelons moi-même.
Les échelons ont dû
t'être reconnaissants.
J'ai besoin d'un verre.
J'ai cru que tu demanderais jamais.
Alors, la réhabilitation ?
Les réhabilitations. Au pluriel.
- Alcool, drogue, sexe, et...
- Meurtre.
T'as été en réhabilitation
pour meurtre ?
Je sais, ridicule.
Un meurtre de temps en temps,
ça fait de mal à personne.
T'es clean maintenant ?
J'ai tout arrêté. Une
vraie vie de prêtre.
Alors, comment va l'Agence du Temps ?
Tu n'es pas au courant ?
Elle a fermé.
Tu plaisantes.
Non. On est plus que sept.
C'est bon de te voir.
C'était pas pareil sans toi.
Tu dois partir.
Je ne veux pas de toi
sur mon territoire.
Quoi ?
A une époque, tu n'avais jamais
assez de moi sur ton "territoire".
Très bien, vous pouvez sortir !
Tout va bien, Jack ?
C'est bon, c'est bon.
T'as une équipe ! Comme c'est mignon !
De jolis petits copains !
Mais pas de blonde.
Il faudrait une blonde.
- Bon sang, il est pire que Jack.
- Votre équipe a un nom ?
J'adore les noms
d'équipes, dis-moi tout !
Torchwood.
Pas Excalibur ?
Blizzard ? Les flics en bikini ? Non ?
Torchwood. Oh mon dieu.
Gwen Cooper, Ianto Jones,
Toshiko Sato, Owen Harper.
- Voici...
- Capitaine John Hart.
- On est de vieux amis.
- Excuse-moi, on est bien plus.
Nous étions partenaires.
- Dans quel sens ?
- Dans tous les sens.
Et bien plus.
Ca a duré deux semaines.
Sauf qu'elles étaient coincées
dans une boucle temporelle,
on a donc été ensemble cinq ans.
C'était comme avoir une femme.
- Tu étais la femme.
- Tu étais la femme !
- Non, tu étais la femme !
- Oh, mais j'étais une bonne femme.
J'imagine bien !
Quoi ?
Faites pas semblant de pas
avoir remarqué, il est mignon.
Ils sont justes timides.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
Je me demandais quand
on en arriverait là.
- C'est le même que le tien.
- En plus petit.
Mais il dure bien plus longtemps.
Mettez deux Agents du
Temps dans une même pièce,
ils en reviennent toujours
à la taille de leurs bracelets.
Bien sûr, mais un Agent
du Temps, c'est quoi ?
Il vous a jamais parlé de son passé ?
Non, pas du tout.
Bref...
Je travaille avec cette femme.
Magnifique.
Intelligente, sexy, tout ça...
on s'est fait tirer dessus.
Avant de mourir, elle m'a supplié.
Elle m'a parlé de bombes à radiations
sur lesquelles elle travaillait.
J'aime pas ça.
Trois cartouches,
au contenu plus que toxique,
ont été avalées par la brèche.
- Et ont fini ici.
- Bingo.
C'est l'inconvénient d'une ville située
sur une brèche du temps et de l'espace.
Laissées à elles-mêmes,
les radiations briseront les cartouches
et infecteront la planète entière.
Il faut les neutraliser.
Qu'est-ce que ça te rapporte ?
Réaliser le voeu d'une mourante.
Il n'y a qu'un problème.
Je ne sais pas où elles sont.
J'espérais de l'aide des gens du coin.
De retour au QG,
je pourrais faire un scan des
radiations sur toute la ville
et croiser les résultats avec
les activités de la brèche.
Qui est-ce, le cerveau et la beauté ?
Tu vois, ensemble,
c'est un travail facile.
On fait ça,
et tu pars quand c'est
terminé. Sur le champ.
Ca veut dire que je
vais voir ta maison ?
Tu vis dans une sculpture ?
Tu pourrais être encore
plus prétentieux ?
Monte.
Ton équipe peut pas rentrer par là ?
C'est l'entrée des touristes.
Je me rappelle la dernière
fois que tu as dis ça.
Où est-ce...
C'est spacieux,
je te l'accorde.
Ton goût en design intérieur de
ne s'est pas arrangé, par contre.
C'est quoi ça, "style égouts" ?
Tes armes.
Et le reste.
Tu me connais, je suis
un homme à deux armes.
Un pistolet sur chaque jambe,
un couteau laser sous le coude gauche,
17 petites charges explosives
dans la doublure de sa veste.
Ca m'a échappé.
C'est un menteur compulsif !
Qu'est-ce qu'il fait là ?
Il y a un petit 1% de chance
qu'il change l'habitude de
toute une vie, et dise la vérité.
Ce qui veut dire que
cette ville est en danger.
Qu'est-ce qu'il voulait
dire par Agent du Temps ?
Tu n'en as jamais parlé.
C'est du passé.
Nous y revoilà.
Tu sais tout de moi, Jack.
Pourquoi tu me mets à l'écart ?
Ici et maintenant, c'est ce qui compte.
Notre travail, la personne
que je suis maintenant.
- C'est ce dont je suis fier.
- Alors pourquoi t'es parti ?
Où es-tu allé ?
Non, dis-le-moi,
où étais-tu ?
Parle-moi.
Je suis mort tellement de fois.
Ramené à la vie,
comme traîné sur du verre cassé.
J'ai vu la fin du monde.
- Comment ?
- Ca n'a plus d'importance.
Mais quand tout ça a été fini...
Je savais que ma place était ici.
Penser que je reviendrai ici
près de vous m'a aidé à me battre.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Une bague de fiançailles.
- Tu vas te marier ?
- Oui.
Rhys a fait sa demande.
Quand tu n'étais pas là.
Gwen Cooper se marie.
Le genou à terre ?
Il a essayé, mais il a eu mal au
dos et a dû s'allonger sur le canapé.
C'est là qu'il m'a posé la question.
- Et tu as dis oui.
- Personne d'autre ne m'épousera.
Je suis content pour toi.
Retournons au travail.
Il y a sept heures, on a enregistré
une surtension d'énergie de la brèche,
à trois endroits.
On est six, trois lieux. Facile.
Deux personnes par cartouche.
Excuse-moi, je donne les ordres.
Eh bien vas-y, grand garçon !
John a raison. Pardon, vous
préférez John ou Capitaine ?
Avec des yeux comme les tiens,
appelle-moi Vera, ça m'ira.
Tosch et Owen, allez au
Nord. Ianto et Jack à l'Ouest.
Vera et moi allons aux docks.
Excusez-moi. Sans vouloir me répéter...
Ca te pose problème, Jack ?
Pas du tout.
Vu que les cartouches sont
radioactives, ne les ouvrez pas, hein ?
C'est parti.
Gwen, je dois te parler.
Oh, je peux regarder ?
Il va te faire la liste des "à
faire et à ne pas faire". J'adore ça.
Elle te rejoint dans une seconde.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Si je peux le faire
parler, flirter un peu...
Il baissera peut-être sa garde.
Je peux découvrir ce qu'il manigance.
- Bien pensé.
- Merci.
Mais dangereux, laisse-moi le faire.
J'ai mené l'équipe pendant ton
absence. Je peux m'en occuper.
Il te connaît trop bien,
il te dira jamais la vérité.
Trois règles.
Un : Ne crois rien de ce qu'il dit.
Deux : garde-le toujours devant toi.
Et trois :
Ne le laisse t'embrasser
sous aucun prétexte.
Comme si j'allais le faire.
<i>Il en est déjà à
l'interdiction de s'embrasser ?</i>
Il a inventé ça parce qu'il
me veut pour lui tout seul.
Je t'en prie.
Rien.
T'es sûr que c'est le bon endroit ?
Oui, mais les containers
sont souvent déplacés.
Ca va prendre des jours.
Alors, cette femme,
la femme aux cartouches,
comment tu l'as connue, déjà ?
On était amoureux.
Désolée.
Ils ont attrapé la
personne qui l'a tuée ?
On doit vraiment parler de ça ?
Non, non, bien sûr.
Fais pas attention à moi.
- Tu ne dors pas ?
- Je l'ai eu !
<i>Pardon ?</i>
Manager pour Hanovoods !
<i>La lettre est arrivée !</i>
J'ai eu le boulot !
Oh mon dieu, Rhys, c'est génial !
Tu es géniale aussi, bébé.
Oui, juste là !
- Qui c'est ?
- Un...
idiot avec qui je travaille.
<i>J'imagine que je ne te verrai
pas avant le petit déj' ?</i>
Je risque d'y passer toute
la nuit. Va te coucher.
Je suis fière de toi.
<i>Je t'aime.</i>
Et je t'aime encore plus.
John ?
John ?
John !
- John !
- Peur de m'avoir perdu ?
Un peu nerveuse ?
Reste devant moi, OK ?
Tu manques vraiment de confiance.
Mais avec ton patron, c'est plutôt sage.
J'ai confiance en lui, merci.
Escroc d'un jour, escroc de toujours.
Comment ça ?
Ne te fie pas à lui, c'est tout, Gwen.
Il y a beaucoup de
choses que tu ignores.
On jette un oeil ?
C'est ça ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Lâche-moi !
Je fête ça,
c'est tout.
Bon sang, le 21ème siècle
est vraiment frigide.
Qu'est-ce que t'as fait ?
Ne te lève pas.
De toute façon, tu peux pas.
Brillant à lèvres paralysant.
C'est Jack qui m'a
appris celui-là, je crois.
Un seul problème,
si on te retrouve pas d'ici deux heures,
l'activité de tes
organes vitaux va cesser.
Merci.
<i>Ca ira là-dedans, sans moi ?</i>
Il ne restera pas avec vous.
Lui et moi avions quelque chose.
Pas d'ampoules.
Non, ça serait trop utile.
Génial, comment on va trouver une
cartouche dans tout ce bordel ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait
de nos vies, Tosh ?
Je sais.
On devrait s'éclater !
Tu serais certainement en pleine
chasse, à cette heure de la nuit.
Non, j'en ai fini avec ça, Tosh.
En parlant de rendement décroissant.
Pas avec toi.
Tu sais...
J'ai tout fait, je sais pas...
Qu'est-ce que ça m'a apporté ?
Non, il me faut...
une femme digne de ce nom.
Quelqu'un avec qui j'aurais
des choses en commun.
Tu as quelqu'un en vue ?
Comme tu le dis,
difficile de rencontrer quelqu'un
avec qui j'ai des choses en commun.
Avec les choses qu'on voit...
Ah, beauté !
Oui !
Travail accompli.
Beau travail, équipiers !
Où est Gwen ?
Arme à terre.
Ou je la descends.
- Jack, où es-tu ?
- J'ai coupé les transmissions
dès qu'on a quitté le
palace sous le trottoir.
J'adore mon petit bracelet.
Bon...
Vos téléphones.
Tu la touches encore, je te tue. OK ?
L'efficacité d'un flingue,
ou la brutalité du bois ?
Arrête de jouer avec moi et fais-le.
Oh, oui !
J'aime l'ambiance de bureau !
Ces endroits m'excitent.
Pour moi, ils sont exotiques.
Les amourettes de bureau...
Photocopier tes fesses...
Ou autre chose, mais
tant qu'on est là...
La brèche était active dans cette zone,
60 mètres au-dessus du sol.
C'est à dire cet étage...
Ou le toit.
Comment tu vas, Ianto ?
Content de vous revoir, Patron.
On peut laisser
tomber le "Patron", non ?
Quand j'étais parti, je me disais...
Que peut-être...
Quand tout ça sera fini...
Un restau, un ciné ?
Tu me proposes un rencard ?
Intéressé ?
Eh bien...
Tant...
que c'est pas dans un bureau.
Tu devrais garder certains
fantasmes pour toi.
Je crois qu'on va devoir
vérifier chaque tiroir,
poubelle et pot de fleurs.
D'accord.
Je m'occupe de cet étage, pour
que tu ne sois pas surexcité,
tu prends le toit.
T'es bon sur les toits.
Jack ?
Pourquoi on l'aide ?
C'est un fantôme de mon passé.
Je veux qu'il parte.
Au fait...
- C'était un oui ?
- Oui !
Dans l'ascenseur, mon beau.
Tes amis sont blessés,
et vont mourir.
Tu as à peine le temps de les sauver.
Owen ? Gwen ?
Tu me prends pour quoi ?
Technologie primitive, facile à bloquer.
Tu devrais avoir honte.
Et arrivé en bas, cours.
Tu es du genre à aimer les
challenges, essaye de les sauver.
Remonte,
et je tire à vue.
<i>Rez de chaussée.</i>
Rez de chaussée !
Oui, s'il vous plaît.
Pourquoi vous faites ça ?
On est une blague cosmique, mon beau.
Un accident chimique et d'évolution.
Les blagues, le sexe,
tout pour oublier que rien n'a de sens.
Et la seule consolation est l'argent.
Alors cours, Ianto Jones !
<i>Rez de chaussée.</i>
<i>Fermeture des portes.</i>
Elu cul de l'année,
5094.
Toujours aussi beau.
Le mignon, pour te dire
de te méfier de moi.
Cartouche.
- Si tu les as touchés...
- Ils sont mignons, mais stupides.
T'avais meilleur goût.
J'en suis pas si sûr.
Donne-la moi.
Bombes à radiations ? Vraiment ?
Ne nous attardons pas sur les détails.
Un peu embarrassant que tu aies eu
besoin de nous pour les trouver.
Un peu humiliant que tu aies marché.
Tes petits pantins ont
fait tout le sale boulot.
C'est ce que tu voulais ?
Je veux que tu reviennes à la raison.
Viens avec moi, Jack.
Comme au bon vieux temps.
On serait des empereurs.
Comment peux-tu rester sur une planète
quand il y a des milliers de mondes,
brillants de merveilles ?
On devrait être là-haut,
parmi les étoiles,
comme si elles nous appartenaient.
Comme avant.
- Je ne peux pas.
- Pourquoi pas ?
Qu'est-ce qui peut
bien te retenir ici ?
Allez.
La splendeur de la galaxie.
Les méfaits qu'on pourrait faire.
T'as jamais vraiment
maîtrisé les beaux discours.
C'est pas un discours. C'est vrai.
Passe à autre chose.
Me voilà,
menant une nouvelle vie et tu
ressasses toujours les mêmes choses.
Et désolé mais ça ne marche plus aussi
bien maintenant que tu es plus vieux.
C'est quoi ça, des
rides au bord des yeux ?
C'est à force de rire.
Oh, quelle bonne blague.
C'est de toi que je ris. Cartouche.
Désolée !
Pourquoi il nous a pas tués ?
Il a eu ce qu'il voulait.
Mais il nous a sous-estimés.
<i>Tosh ! Owen !</i>
Ianto !
<i>Tosh !</i>
On est là.
- Que s'est-il passé ?
- Où est Gwen ?
- Des nouvelles d'elle ?
- Non.
La réhabilitation...
n'a pas vraiment marché.
Les clés de l'entrée.
Merci.
Si elle est là-dedans, on la
trouvera jamais, il y en a trop !
Continue à chercher !
Bon sang, il me faut plus de calmants.
Je réessaye son portable.
Par ici !
- Elle a dû le perdre.
- Gwen !
Gwen !
A moins que ce soit encore
un coup du Capitaine John.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Si Gwen a utilisé son téléphone ici,
je peux savoir où elle se trouvait
lors de son dernier appel.
C'est bon !
C'est ici qu'elle a appelé.
Vérifiez tous les containers !
<i>Elle est là !</i>
Gwen, c'est bon.
On est là.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Qu'est-ce qu'elle a ?
Elle respire encore.
Pas de blessures apparentes.
- Tosh, démarre-moi ça.
- Ianto, prends une compresse.
Pupilles dilatées, elle
est encore consciente.
Reste avec nous, chérie.
Il l'a empoisonnée.
Kit anti-poison !
Gwen, tiens bon.
Il a fallu que tu voles une voiture.
Et te faire remarquer.
Bon...
OK...
Mignons et résistants.
Est-ce juste ?
T'as peut-être pas réalisé.
Tu peux nous frapper, nous
tirer dessus, nous menacer,
même nous empoisonner,
on reviendra toujours.
Plus forts à chaque fois.
Je dois vous informer, votre
chef est étalé sur le...
Trottoir.
Ca, c'est impressionnant.
Sérieusement tu te ferais...
une fortune dans les galaxies
Vegas avec un jeu pareil.
Alors, comment ça marche ?
Je ne peux pas mourir.
- Non, vraiment...
- Non, vraiment, tu ne peux pas me tuer.
Tu auras beau essayer.
Je ne peux pas mourir.
Jamais.
Mais qu'est-ce que ça te coûte ?
Chaque fois que tu dois te ramener
à la vie, qu'est-ce que tu ressens ?
Que de peine et de trauma.
En plus, tu reviens dans ce merdier.
Je te plains.
Ces gens,
cette planète,
toute cette beauté que
tu ne verras jamais.
C'est pour ça que je reviens.
C'est bien pour toi.
Que contiennent les cartouches ?
Le moment de vérité, Capitaine.
D'accord.
Cette femme,
avait un diamant Arcadien,
la pierre la plus précieuse
de l'Amas de Damascène.
Dès que j'ai mis la main sur elle,
elle a généré sa propre
faille dans la brèche.
Bon sang, je déteste les génies.
Tu disais que c'était le
souhait d'une mourante.
Oui, elle mourait.
Je lui ai tiré dessus.
J'ai eu de la chance
que ça atterrisse ici.
Alors, 50/50 ?
La moitié, c'est une bonne affaire.
Sauf si une orgie vous tente ?
- Ouvre-le.
- Même pas s'il te plaît ?
Tes manières ressuscitent pas avec toi ?
Maintenant !
Ca devrait nous donner la
localisation du diamant.
La voilà.
La femme que tu as tuée.
<i>Tu as parcouru plusieurs
galaxies pour ça.</i>
<i>Bien joué.</i>
Merci, beauté.
<i>Sauf...</i>
<i>Qu'il n'y a pas de diamant.</i>
Quoi ?
<i>Seulement ça.</i>
Non, non.
Non, non, non...
Il doit y avoir un diamant.
Tout ça, c'était pour le diamant.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ça ?
C'est un engin explosif,
qui reconnaîtra l'ADN de mon meurtrier.
Il explosera dans dix minutes.
Il ne peut être enlevé
sans exploser, donc...
Perds pas ton temps à essayer.
Au revoir, mon amour.
- Non, attends.
- On se verra en enfer.
Elle est pas sérieuse. Dix minutes ?
Enlevez-le-moi !
En fait, 9 min 50, 49, 48...
Toujours sous la main !
De quelle taille devrait
être l'explosion, Jack ?
Cette technologie, de
cette taille... grosse.
On devrait le faire sortir de la ville.
9 min 37.
Aide-moi ! S'il te plaît.
Pourquoi ?
Lâche-la.
Jack, aide-moi !
Reviens là !
Qu'est-ce que t'as fait ?
C'est du super métal, imperméable,
ultra verrouillé.
Pas moyen de les ouvrir.
A moins d'avoir cette clé.
Tu es incroyable !
Mais tu me trouves toujours
étrangement attirant.
T'as intérêt à trouver une solution
pronto ou elle explose avec moi !
Lui tirer dessus
changerait quelque chose ?
Non.
On fait quoi maintenant, les gars ?
L'orgie tient toujours, d'ailleurs.
- Surtout avec les menottes.
- 9 min 04 sec.
Tosh, tu as perfectionné le
programme de prédiction de brèche ?
- A peu près.
- Quoi ?
- Rien dans les prochaines minutes ?
- Gwen, hors de question.
De quoi elle parle ?
Si on est dans la brèche
quand le disque explosera,
la ville n'aura rien.
- En quoi ça nous sauve ?
- En rien.
8 min 32, 31...
- Tu bluffes.
- Va savoir.
Le parking où il est arrivé.
La fissure dans la brèche
est toujours active.
On y va.
Quelqu'un doit faire quelque chose.
- Coupe-lui la main.
- Ca activerait la bombe.
Me force pas à te tirer !
Monte les marches !
5 min 22.
Je trouve pas la fréquence de l'engin.
Aucune chance de la brouiller !
Où est Jack ? Il devrait être là.
Je le dis depuis le début,
on peut pas compter sur lui.
Ferme-la !
Je commence à comprendre
pourquoi il aime cet endroit.
Elle est belle, il est magnifique.
Tu ne t'arrêtes jamais ?
Il me reste 5 minutes,
à quoi tu t'attends ?
- Oh, c'est superbe.
- C'est un caniche.
C'est beau.
- Ca a intérêt à marcher.
- Aies confiance, je sais improviser.
Dehors !
- OK.
- Sors !
J'aime les femmes caractérielles.
51 secondes.
Tu ne vas pas vraiment te sacrifier ?
45 secondes.
On doit y aller.
Non ! Et un sauvetage
de dernière minute ?
Pourquoi être dans une équipe sinon ?
40 secondes.
Dites...
Dites à Jack...
Dites à Jack que je...
<i>30 secondes.</i>
Qu'est-ce qu'il fait ?
Lâche-moi !
Owen, ça marche pas.
15 secondes !
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- On essaye d'embrouiller le disque !
- Pourquoi ça marche pas ?
- Je sais pas !
- 12 secondes !
- Jack, fais quelque chose !
Je dois y aller, Jack.
<i>Cinq...</i>
<i>Quatre...</i>
Trois...
<i>Deux...</i>
<i>Un !</i>
Courrez !
Qu'est-ce que...
Que se passe-t-il ?
Pourquoi il fait noir ?
La brèche est revenue
au moment de son arrivée.
On est retournés au début de la nuit.
Comme si tu n'avais jamais été là.
Maintenant on doit
s'éviter nous-mêmes, super !
C'est un déplacement temporel !
Ca te donne des frissons ? Mignon !
La seringue contenait quoi ?
L'ADN de Torchwood.
Quoi ?
Un mélange d'ADN de chacun d'entre
nous, injecté dans son coeur.
Ca a corrompu son ADN,
et embrouillé le disque.
Donc il y a un peu de vous tous en moi ?
Bons dieux, juste ce
dont j'avais besoin.
Merci, Owen.
- De rien.
- Je veux que tu partes.
Il faut d'abord trouver
comment se débarrasser de ça.
En fait...
Une vieille ruse Artésienne.
Tu la gardes au fond de
la gorge. C'est très utile.
- Tu l'avais tout du long.
- Tu étais ma seule chance de survie.
Aucune animosité.
Enfin, pas dans ce sens là.
Rappelle-moi de jamais te contrarier.
Plus gros, vraiment.
- Si tu veux agrandir ton équipe...
- Non.
- Vraiment ? Je pourrais...
- Non.
- Mais...
- Non.
Vas-y, tu peux encore te
servir des résidus d'énergie.
- Ecoute...
- Au revoir.
OK.
Au fait...
J'ai failli oublier...
J'ai trouvé Gray.
Qui est Gray ?
C'est rien.
Retournons au travail.
<i>As-tu déjà vu quelque
chose d'aussi incroyable...</i>
<i>que l'espace d'un instant, tu
penses qu'il y a peut-être plus ?</i>
<i>Qui êtes-vous ?</i>
Vous êtes Torchwood, c'est ça ?
Une brèche dans le temps et
l'espace traverse Cardiff,
des choses arrivent d'autres temps
et planètes, on les surveille.
Nous fais pas perdre notre temps,
on sait que tu es un extraterrestre.
Les extraterrestres n'existent pas.
Eloignez-vous !
Quoi, c'est pas assez effrayant ?
Sérieusement,
il n'y a que le sexe avec vous.
Tu as mal choisi la fille à harceler.
Quand est-ce que les autres arrivent ?
Ils sont déjà là.
Oh mon dieu !
Bienvenue sur la planète Terre.
- Qui c'est, ça ?
- Mlle Martha Jones.
Une humaine qui a voyagé
dans le temps et l'espace.
Vous êtes vraiment spéciale.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Je ne sais pas.
Toshiko, montre-moi la ville.
Ils sont partout.
<i>Seul toi peut arrêter ça.</i>
<i>Sinon, c'est la fin.</i>
<i>On se souvient toujours
de ce qu'on a tué.</i>
N'est-ce pas, Jack ?
Dix ogives nucléaires.
Tout est fini.
Faisons tous l'amour.
Et je pensais que la fin du
monde pouvait pas empirer.
<i>Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?</i>
On continue à surveiller.
A faire ce qu'on fait.

Mike
did you hear that?
Someone's in the living room!
-Are you gonna go in there?
-Are you?
-Emergency, which service?
-Police.
My name's Beth Halloran,
I'm at 114 Brodsky Gardens.
I think there's a burglar in the flat,
come quickly.
-Come on!
-Mike! Mike!
Sit down!-
of them! My husband's been injured, send an ambulance!
Get the TV stuff unhooked.
-just take whatever you want!
-Keep her quiet.
Wait, wait. Did you hear that?
Emergency ****
-What's happening?
-Get away from me!
-What is that thing?
-Please, don't...
Don't... Please...Stop, Stop!
-I'm sorry!
-What's going on?!
I'm sorry!
No-0-0-o!
Get away! No-0-0-o!

Tosh, what happened?
Two IC one males, one fatality, one seriously wounded
after a fall from a fifth-floor window onto a police vehicle.
Bloody hell! Here you are,
has he been stabilised?
Gwen, Owen, go with him to the hospital,
see if he says anything.
Interview the husband and wife while you're there. Tosh, with me.
Bit weird, this one. Might be one of yours.
Nobody saw anything, heard anything, blah, blah, blah.
Dunno why we bother asking anymore.
Thanks, we'll take it from here.
If you could just wait outside.
-In my opinion, the husband
did it. He was expecting to be burgled.
-Really?
Yeah, look. No other reason I can think of
for keeping sports equipment in the bedroom.
0h, you should come round to my house for a game of hockey sometime.
-Making friends?
-Not really. What have you got?
No glass inside,
so it was definitely broken out.
Police say the stab wounds were caused
by some long, narrow blade.
Which that isn't.
No other weapons in the room could have done this. So how the hell did they manage it?
Husband was unconscious,
and the wife probably weighs less than I do.
-I can't see either of them doing this.
-you'd be surprised what you can do.
I didn't see anything. We all heard this weird noise,
then the next thing I know, I'm in the corner and he's just sitting there, dead.
-The other one was just gone.
-And then what?
Nothing. I just stayed there till the police arrived. I couldn't move.
I should have checked on Mike.
Don't be silly. You did the right thing. I'm fine.
Be quiet, you. The doctor said you should rest.
I don't think the doctor meant my mouth.
Actually, he did, he was very specific.
He said, 'No talking for a whole week.'
Lies, lies! Why so many lies?!
OK, thanks for your time. We'll let you get some rest now.
-Not a trace of blood on their hands, either of them.
-Then who did it?
-She did, obviously.
-Why obviously?
Well, look at her.
It's OK.
Yeah, I can see what you're saying, she's absolutely terrified.
It's always the one you least suspect. Hubby's out cold, and she survives while two burglars get mangled?
-She did it, she must have.
-How?
-I haven't worked that bit out yet.
-Ah, I see, I see.
All right then, jessica Fletcher,
who dunn it?
The husband. His wife's in danger,
he has a cricket bat under the bed.
-You fill in the blanks.
-Right, OK.
So, he kills one man, wearing gloves,
and then he swallows the murder weapon
and the gloves,
and then he knocks himself out?
-Something like that, yeah.
-To be continued.
-Yeah?/It's me. Anything?
-No, nothing. They're completely clear.
Well, one of them did it,
we just need to figure out how.
Stay with the burglar
all night if you have to.
Keep an eye on those two.
-OK, fair enough.
-Tosh...
That was jack.
He says that you should stay with the burglar,
and find out if he knows anything,
all night, if you have to. I know.
-And keep an eye on the other two.
-Brilliant. Brilliant.
Oh, will you get me a coffee before you go?
Yeah, course. What are team mates for?
You haven't got a pound for the machine, have you?
Hospitals. They have to fall apart before anyone fixes them.
-Pound. Coffee.
-Thank you!
Oh, you're safe, all right?
You're safe, just tell me who did this to you.
The woman.....in the flat,
keep her away from me!
Page the doctor.
Can you move, please?
We need to lie him down. ********
-Tell me everything.
-Where am I?
-Where's my husband?
-He's safe.
-What do you mean, safe?
What have you done with him?
-Nothing yet.
Tell me what happened in the flat, Beth.
It had to be you or Mike, so how did you do it?
You can't treat people like this.
I've been burgled, attacked!
I want a lawyer, I want a phone call.
-If you're charging me...
-We're not charging you.
We don't have to.
There'll be no lawyer, no phone calls,
just us, and this room
for as long as it takes.
Now, tell me what happened!
I told her... and the police.
Please, I don't know anything!
Look at them.
The second one just died in hospital. 'Keep her away from me, the woman in the flat.'
Those were his dying words. Why would he say something like that?!
I don't know, I swear. I never touched him.
-Is it Mike? Are you covering for him?
-No!
Jack?
Beth, we know these men attacked you and your husband.
Now, if you fought back,
people will understand.
It was self-defence.
I promise...I promise I have no idea what happened to them.
All I know is that it wasn't me.
'just us and this room for as long as it takes?'
Terrifying.
-Really?
-Absolutely.
Shivers down my spine.
-You don't look scared.
-Oh, it...passed.
-Tosh, anything on the body scan?
-Nothing out of the ordinary.
-What about the light? Power surge?
-Nothing from us.
There was an electro-magnetic build-up around her, but how did she cause it?
Same thing happened at the hospital. Can't be a coincidence.
It's her, I know it is.
-OK, let's do some tests,
see who or what we're dealing with.
-I'm on it.
What kind of tests?
just little things to clear this all up.
Blood samples...
Blood samples?
I haven't done anything!
Look. ..
I believe you, but this is our job.
Something strange happened at your flat. We've gotta make sure you had nothing to do with it.
-I didn't.
-Then you've nothing to worry about.
They're doing these tests whether you like it or not.
Don't make this any harder on yourself. Come on.
This is where you work?
Yep. Cosy, isn't it?
Who are you people?
Don't you have any windows?
It wouldn't really be in keeping with the whole secrecy thing, people looking in.
-We don't sniff the sub-etheric resonator.
-Sorry.
It's so big.
-This is crazy.
-Yep.
I suddenly feel very, very small.
Come on.
Let's just get these tests done. Then you can get home, OK?
-Come on, Owen.
-We'll start with a few blood tests,
nothing to worry about,
just a little...needle.
-What?
-Needle's snapped.
-Haven't you got a nurse to do this?
-He's a doctor. It's OK.
I'm not gonna do this if you can't even...
What are you doing?
-Bear with me.
-Hey, hey!
When was the last time you were in hospital, Beth?
I don't remember.
I don't think I ever have.
Why, what's wrong with me?
-Any operations? Checkups?
-No, nothing.
When was the last time you felt ill? You had a cold?
I don't think I ever have.
I take a lot of vitamin C.
Mm, hell of a lot I reckon.
OK, Beth. You make light bulbs blow, we can't break your skin.
What planet are you from?
Earth.
Stop wasting our time!
We know you're an alien!
There's no such thing as aliens.
Beth, janet.
janet, Beth.
-What is it?
-It's an alien. But you know that cos you are, too.
No, it's not.
I'm not. I work in an office...
Why do you give off electro-magnetic waves? Why?!
I don't know! Stop it!
Why are you doing this?! I want Mike.
I want to go home.
Why is it doing that?
I don't know.
It's never done it before.
-This is real, isn't it?
-Yeah.
I don't know about my skin,
or any of that other stuff.
I just... How can I prove it to you?
How can I...prove to you...
that I'm not an alien?
-You said we weren't allowed to use that again.
-It's just a mind probe.
-Remember what happened last time we used it?
-That was different.
That species has extremely high blood pressure.
0h, right, their heads must explode all the time.
Jack, You can't do this.
What if you're wrong?
-If she's human, it'll kill her.
-I'm not wrong.
-We have to find out what she is.
-Take it easy, jack.
-Stop at the first sign of trouble.
-Or the first sign of exploding.
Gwen...
bring her up.
OK.
Hey!
-Not too tight, is it?
-It's fine.
-Are you sure this is safe?
-Yep.
just try not to, you know,
kill me, or anything, OK?
You'll probably get dehydrated during the probing.
Thank you.
-We're all set.
-The probe drills down through
your consciousness,
so if there's anything hidden,
it'll pop to the surface.
Will it hurt?
Yeah.
Your bedside manner's rubbish.
You should see his manners in bed,
they're atrocious. So I've heard.
0h, they are. I remember this...
-All right, we all ready?
-I suppose.
OK, we'll do this slowly.
Tosh will controlthe probe,
Owen will make sure you're not in danger,
Ianto will have more water when you need it,
and I'll be right here, OK?
What about him?
What does he do?
I'll be watching.
Are you ready, Beth?
All right.
OK, Tosh.
Human.
-Safe.
-Who killed the burglars, Beth?
I don't know! I... Ah!
-Safe.
-What planet are you from?
I'm human! 0h, God, it hurts!
-Please, please, stop!
-Go deeper.
-Are you sure? She...
-Do it!
Vital signs are all over the place,
but still safe.
Getting electro-magnetic build-up again.
Who killed those men?!
I don't know! Make it stop!
-That's it, come on!
-Go deeper.
-Safe.
-Deeper!
Something's happening to the lights!
-The electro-magnetic pulse is off the scale.
-She can't take much more!
jack, we've got to stop this!
Oh, my God!
I wouldn't get that close.
Toshiko, what happened?
Hit a buried compartment. Locked away.
She couldn't have been aware of it.
-Who are you?
-Kayehla janees, putaak graszh,
ish nin fas du hap vac nal.
-Where are you from?
-Kayehla janees, putaak graszh,
ish nin fas du hap vac nal.
How do you like my boots?
Kayehla janees, putaak graszh,
ish nin fas du hap vac nal.
jack, what is it, what is she saying?
Name, rank, serial number,
and that's all she's gonna say.
How do you know?
Cos I know who she is
and why she's here.
-Switch off the probe.
-Off.
0h, you weren't lying, that really hurt!
Did you find anything?
She's a sleeper agent.
It all clicked when I saw the implant.
A sleeper agent? Who for?
No-one knows very much,
they don't leave survivors.
Official designation is Cell 114.
They infiltrate planets,
adapting their bodies,
gathering intelligence,
sometimes for years, watching,
until they're ready to take over.
OK, that's...creepy.
If we're lucky, she's the first.
They send an advance guard to gather intel.
Given false memories so they blend in.
She has no idea she's not human.
Her real self must have taken over briefly,
killed the burglars.
-Self preservation.
-Told you she did it.
Yeah, The point is, by the time they attack,
they know every single thing about the planet.
Tosh.
The implant gathers information.
Normal X-rays don't show it.
She's projecting a false image.
It's got all this data stored inside it.
This is a force-field generator.
it creates an impervious layer above the skin,
just a nanometre thick.
-That's why you couldn't get the needle inside her.
-Right, well...
God, look, they even know about us.
They know more about this place than I do.
Nobody knows more than I do.
What if there's more of them?
What are we gonna do about this?
For a start...
I think we should tell her.
Kayehla janees, putaak graszh,
ish nin fas du hap vac nal.
-Where are you from?
-Kayehla janees, putaak graszh...
Can you turn it off, please?
-So I killed those men?
-Yes.
And I'm a mass-murdering alien?
-Yes.
-My whole life...
all my memories, they can't be fake.
I know I love Mike...
-and he loves me.
-He does, and you do.
-So what's real?
-You both are, you both fell in love.
That happened.
Do you feel human?
-Yes.
-Yes. Well, then you are.
What makes us human?
Is it our minds or our bodies?
And what happens when the disguise comes off?
I want to have kids one day.
Is feeling human...
enough for that?
Can you fix me?
Can you make me human?
No.
Eventually, you'll activate.
Your real memories will come back,
and Beth will disappear.
What do you mean, activate?
Once you gather enough information,
you'll send it back home,
and start the invasion.
There must be something you can do.
All this technology, everything you do here...
You can't keep me locked up next to that thing!
-Are you gonna kill me?
-No. No, of course we're not.
Have you killed other aliens?
Only when we've had to.
When it was the last resort -
kill or be killed.
I wish this wasn't happening.
I'd never know.
I'd just live a normal life.
-Until the day ofthe attack.
-I won't do anything!
I'm not that person!
I'm sorry, but you are.
We can't let her go,
she's too dangerous.
We could freeze her.
Use the alien cryogenics.
Wake her up if we figure out
how to stop her memories from coming back.
-Freeze her? For how long?
-As long as it takes.
-At least she'd be alive.
-Her implant would still gather information.
-Can't we deactivate it?
-I can isolate the transceiver
and fry it in an EM pulse.
Right now It's not sending or receiving anything now. I've checked it five times on every frequency.
Won't that let them know we're onto them?
No. If we freeze her, she'll never activate and they'll never know.
What about her husband?
She'd have to disappear completely.
No goodbyes.
We had a holiday booked.
Nothing special, just a weekend away.
-Am I ever gonna see him again?
-I don't know.
0h, those men...
0h, my God, those poor men!
What's happening?!
The real memory is coming back,
destroying the fake human persona.
The sooner we do this,
the better for everyone.
Beth? Beth, come on.
Promise me something,
if you can't figure out how to keep me human,
don't wake me up.
just turn the machine off.
That's not a promise I can keep.
OK, you then. I bet you can.
-just don't let me hurt anyone.
-You have my word.
It's funny, I've always had this nagging feeling like I didn't fit in.
just. . .so desperate to have a more exciting life.
-I'm going to hit the transceiver with an EM pulse.
-You won't feel anything. It won't harm you.
It'll take out the force-field generator too
so I'll have to fry them both.
Do it. I don't want to be invincible.
After that I'm gonna sedate you,
then we'll freeze you.
It'll be just like going to sleep.
Only a bit colder.
-Bye, Gwen.
-Bye.
Done.
'If you want the whole bloody seat to yourself, be my guest.
'In fact,' I said,
'why don't we ask the other passengers to get off,
'and you can have the whole carriage to yourself?
Would you like that?'
-You didn't!
-I did. I was really loud, too.
I couldn't help it, I was just really annoyed. So then...
So then, right, she gives me the dirtiest look, right, and she...
David?
What is that?!
What's happened to your arm?
Hey! Where are you going?
David, you're scaring me!
What are you doing?
What's happening?
Come back here!
David!
It's done.
I'm sending her down to the vault.
-Can somebody tell me
what the hell is going on?
-0h, shit!
-What happened?
-Beth's gone.
-I thought she was frozen!
-She was! Her vitals were at zero.
-Checking systems, command history...
-What did she do?
Is it a virus, a lockdown?
-No, she just turned off the lights.
-What is it with her and light bulbs?
-She went through the tunnels.
-Time to change the locks again.
She knew everything about this place,
it was all in her arm. The tunnels,
layout, security codes.
She could've shut us down,
blown us up, anything!
-She didn't.
-I swear she was frozen.
-Tosh, you switched off the transceiver?
-Yes.
-Are you sure?
-Well, I was until you asked.
-Unless there was another false image.
-Hang on, hang on.
Everything about her was a lie.
All of her vital signs were a false image.
She can fool the equipment,
tell it what we're expecting to see,
so she gets scared and it projects an increased heart rate, we try and freeze it and it does the opposite.
Simulating that much information would need a huge amount of energy.
-No wonder she had a big electro-magnetic field.
-That's why the lights blew when she got upset.
So, what's she doing?
Did we activate her?
She couldn't be activated.
If she was, we'd all be dead.
We took her off the network.
She has some other agenda.
Hey.
How are you feeling?
What's going on?
Nobody will tell me anything.
-You all right?
-I'm fine.
Listen, you know l love you, don't you?
Course I do. I love you, too.
-Do you promise?
-Why?
I just had to be sure.
I have to go away.
What do you mean? Where?
I can't tell you, but it's for your own good.
Beth, what are you talking about?
No. I'm sorry. I just...
I have to stay away from you.
If I don't...I'm gonna end up hurting you.
Well, this is hurting me. Don't go.
Whatever happens...
just know that I love you...
and I always will.
If you've...If you've done something,
I don't care,
-just don't leave me.
We'll get through this.
-No, not this time.
I have to put things straight, and I can't do that anywhere near you.
-I love you too much for that.
-Don't let the police take you!
I'm not gonna let you go. I don't care what it is, I don't care what...
-What was that?
-I don't know. It sounded like...
He... Help!
Help! Somebody, get a doctor!
Help!
-Somebody!
-What are...
Somebody!
-Beth!
-Sorry...
I was just...It was an accident,
I just wanted to say goodbye...
She's got a weapon system built into her arm.
Clear.
It's getting worse. She's losing control, we need to contain her fast.
Come on, Beth. Let's get you back.
-No! No!
-Come on! Come on! Get up! Go.
So, what else happened at school today?
-Alex has got a girlfriend.
-Oh?
-Have not!
-Have too.
-She's called jessica.
-I'm gonna kill you so much.
-Patrick Grainger?
-Alex, don't kill your sister.
Not before tea anyway!
Patrick?
0h, my God, stop it!
Get away from him!
Oh, no!
Please, don't hurt my children!
No, please!
Oi! Fuckflap! Get back in that truck or I'll shove it up your arse!
0h, shit!
Tosh? We got her. It's all over.
We're on our way.
You OK?
Yeah... I think so, yeah.
-What the hell was that?
-Petrol tanker.
Looks like someone wanted to take out the M4 link road for some...
No! It's not the road. There's an underground fuel pipeline.
It's the special fuel supply for the military, they use it in emergencies.
Not any more. Hold on.
I've got a report coming through.
-Patrick Grainger's
been murdered.
-Who?
Leader of the Council, stabbed several times in the chest, and once in the forehead.
-Sound familiar?
-Why would anyone want to kill him?
He's also the city co-ordinator.
Takes charge of the city during major emergencies,
-has all the security protocols.
-How do you know that?
I know everything.
And it says so on the screen.
They're putting all the pieces in place.
Gwen, take her.
Tosh, Owen, it's starting,
it's happening right now.
Tosh? It's not just her.
She's part of a cell, and they've activated.
It's happening.
-Tell me how to stop it!
-It can't be.
-Think!
-Beth, look at me.
Look at me!
-How do we stop this?
-I don't know.
I'm cut off from the cell.
I don't know what the mission is. I'm sorry.
What about your implant.
How did you get out of Torchwood?
The technology is part of me.
I can switch it on,
I can use the tools.
Can you do that now?
Can you trace the other cell?!
No! What if it goes wrong?
If you don't, Beth,
other people will die.
Not just Mike.
There's only one left.
-I can track him.
-Let's go. Come on.
Hang on, I've got an idea.
No. I can't just hook something up!
The entire telephone network is down!
-What about a mobile
connection?
-The entire telephone
network is down!
Mobiles, landlines, tin cans with bits of string.
Everything. Absolutely everything.
All phones broken.
Hello? Anyone there? No,
cos the phones aren't working.
-What's that?
-CB radio.
They knocked out the phones,
but they can't knock out the radio waves.
Not yet, anyway.
-What about we try...
-There is no way of getting in touch with jack!
-No way!
-Tosh, Owen, can you hear me?
Jack;
-Thank God. What happened?
-There's a cell, it's active.
Four including Beth, two are dead.
We're tracking the last guy now.
-If we can get to him,
we can stop this.
-What can I do?
He's heading for an abandoned farm outside the city.
I need to know what's there.
Where the hell's he going?
There's nothing there!
Nothing on the surface.
-He's nearly there, we need to hurry.
-Hurrying, thank you.
-What happens when it starts?
-How do you get in the heavy weapons?
I don't know.
I think we just have this arm stuff.
How do you manage to take over so quickly?
I don't know. I didn't even know how to use this thing until today.
***************************
The army sealed it off in the 'l??s,
doesn't say why.
Let me see if I can get into the military files.
Come on, guys,
that wasn't even difficult.
You disappoint me.
It's almost obscene
what you do to security systems.
-0h, God./What is it?
-The mineshaft.
The military are using it for storage.
Nuclear warheads. Ten of them.
-Nobody's supposed to know,
not even us.
-That's how it starts.
-No heavy weapons.
-Exactly. They don't need any!
They use our own against us.
We left the key under the doormat.
All you need is to walk in and take over.
-Tell me you can stop it.
-Going as fast as we can.
If we don't, we won't feel a thing.
We're at the centre of the blast radius.
-That's comforting.
-Come on, have a little faith!
With a dashing hero like me on the case,
how can we fail?
He is dashing, you have to give him that.
-And what if they can't stop it?
-They'll stop it.
-Yeah, but if they can't?
-Then it's all over.
Let's all have sex.
I thought the end of the world couldn't get any worse.
Halt! Stop the vehicle!
Get out ofthe vehicle now!
Lie face down on the ground!
0n the ground or we shoot!
Fire!
-Have we thought this part of the plan through?
-This isn't gonna be pretty,
brace yourselves.
-How are we going to stop him, Jack?
-Like this.
This wasn't supposed to happen today. How do we stop it?
Gwen? Gwen!
It doesn't matter.
You can't stop us.
We know what your weakness is.
We know who you are, jack Harkness.
We know all about you, and Torchwood.
We got a lot of information before you switched her off.
You'll be factored into our plans.
-Gwen?
-Nearly there.
I've got it. He's done.
Don't bother, your transmitter's dead.
-So is your force-field.
-You're lying.
0h, yeah?
Factor that into your plans.
Now, when are the others coming?
They're already here.
I won't let you take me.
Run!
It's done.
-I'll do it, but I'm not happy.
-just do what you have to.
We're set with the cryogenics when you're ready.
Will it work this time?
Tosh has reconfigured the casket.
It'll work around the implant.
-No more false images.
-If we'd been one minute later
We weren't.
-We stopped him.
-What happens when you have to stop me?
-If the freezing doesn't work?
-It won't come to that.
I can feel it coming.
It's pushing me out.
What will you do when I lose my last bit of me?
We will figure something out, Beth.
No, we won't.
I'm too dangerous for that,
we both know it.
Do you...have someone...
at home?
A fiance.
Have you ever hurt them?
More than once, yes.
Remember how guilty you felt?
Imagine that...times a billion...
all the time...every second of the day.
That's how I feel now.
And the worst part is,
when I turn back,
I won't feel guilty any more.
I'll want to carry out my mission.
I won't even care about Mike.
I'll forget all about him.
I don't wanna die as one of those things, Gwen.
-I don't wanna forget about Mike.
-Then don't.
Let's do this. Who knows
what we'll be able to do
in a month? A year?
Thanks for being so good to me.
Remember me the way I am now.
Remember...Beth.
Beth...
Beth...
I won't let you freeze me!
I'll kill you all!
Let her go! Let her go!
No! Wait, wait, wait, don't shoot! It's a trick.
She won't hurt me.
Move away from her now!
Everybody, calm down!
Beth.....you don't want to do this.
Let Gwen go.
I'll kill her first, then all of you,
then the rest of your miserable species!
Beth, please! They will kill you.
You have proved to be better than that,
you helped us to stop the invasion. You can be human. Please!
-Not human enough.
-Beth.
Goodbye, Gwen.
Good luck.
She wanted you to shoot her!
She used her last shred of humanity to do this.
We couldn't take that chance.
She must have known that.
She did.
She just wanted to make it easier for us.
Do you think we stopped it?
Maybe. Maybe we've just put it off for a while, I don't know.
-We don't know anything.
-We know plenty.
We know about the implant.
We can disable their force-field.
We know how they attack.
We know that they can be killed.
While they think they have
the element of surprise,
we know they haven't.
But, until that day,
we just keep doing what we do.
0h, them be fightin' words,
they be, Gwen.
-So, have you set a date?
-Oh, don't get me started, please.
My mam's already been on the phone, saying,
'What about the local church? It's ever so lovely.'
Go home.
Keep doing what we do.
Good night, jack.
He's a frozen soldier from 1918.
-We have to wake him up every 12 months.
-Leave me alone!
-It's me. Toshiko.
-Is it time again?
Two different times should never exist simultaneously.
You shouldn't be here!
Chunks of 1918 will start to appear at the hospital.
We've got a few ghosts.
I think you'd better come with us.
He needs to be in the hospital, ready to step from one time to another.
-You're the only one who can stop this.
-Why me?!
It's not years in the future. It's now.

C'était quoi ce bruit ?
Il y a quelqu'un dans le salon !
- Tu ne vas pas voir ?

- Les urgences. C'est pour ?
- La police.
Je m'appelle Beth Halloran,
Je suis au 114 Brodsky Gardens.
Je crois qu'il y a un cambrioleur,
venez vite.
- Allez !
- Mike !
Assis !
Ils sont deux ! Envoyez une ambulance !
Débranche la télé.
- Prenez ce que vous voulez.
- Fais-la taire.
Attends. Tu as entendu ?

<i>Tosh, que s'est-il passé ?</i>
<i>Un mort, deux en soin intensif dont un</i>
<i>après une chute du cinquième étage
sur une voiture de police.</i>
Putain ! Nous voilà,
vous l'avez stabilisé ?
Gwen, Owen, allez avec lui à l'hosto
au cas où il parle.
Allez aussi voir le couple.
Tosh, tu viens avec moi.
<i>Assez bizarre pour qu'on vous appelle.</i>
Personne n'a rien vu ni entendu...
Je sais pas pourquoi on demande encore.
Merci, on prend le relais.
Veuillez attendre dehors.
A mon avis c'est le mari.
Il s'y attendait.
Vraiment ?
Je vois aucune autre raison d'avoir
du matériel de sport dans sa chambre.
Venez jouer au hockey chez moi un jour.
- On se fait un ami ?
- Pas vraiment. Alors ?
Pas de verre à l'intérieur,
ça a bien été cassé d'ici.
Les blessures ont été causées
par une longue lame étroite. Pas ça.
Aucune autre arme. Comment ont-ils pu ?
Le mari était dans les vapes
et la femme doit peser moins que moi.
- Tous deux doivent être innocents.
- Qui sait, quand on a peur pour sa vie.
<i>Je n'ai rien vu. Il y a eu ce bruit,</i>
Et puis comme ça, il était mort.
- L'autre n'était plus là.
- Et après ?
Rien. Impossible de bouger
jusqu'à l'arrivée de la police.
J'aurais dû m'occuper de Mike.
Ne dis pas de bêtise. Je vais bien.
On se tait. Tu es censé te reposer.
A mon avis ça ne concerne pas ma bouche.
Si, le médecin était formel.
'Silence total pendant une semaine.'
Pourquoi tant de mensonges ?
Merci beaucoup, reposez-vous bien.
- Pas de sang sur leurs mains.
- Alors qui est coupable ?
- Elle, évidemment.
- Et pourquoi ?
Regarde-la.
Tout va bien.
Soit, elle est terrorisée.
La moins suspecte. Le mari est KO,
elle survit à ce qui défonce ces mecs ?
- Obligé, elle est coupable.
- Comment elle aurait fait ?
- J'ai pas encore trouvé.
- Je vois.
OK, Sherlock Holmes,
qui est coupable ?
Le mari. Sa femme est en danger
et il garde une batte sous son lit.
- Je te fais pas un dessin.
- Admettons.
Il tue un des deux, ganté,
avale l'arme du crime
ainsi que les gants,
puis se met KO lui-même ?
- Un truc dans le genre.
- A suivre.
- C'est moi. Vous en êtes où ?
- Nulle part, ils sont clean.
L'un d'eux est coupable,
il n'y a qu'à trouver comment.
Reste avec le voleur toute la nuit
si besoin, et surveille les deux.
- OK, logique.
- Tosh...
C'était Jack. Il veut que tu restes
avec le cambrioleur.
Découvre tout ce qu'il sait. Reste
toute la nuit si besoin, lourd.
- Et surveille les deux autres.
- Génial.
Tu m'apportes un café avant de partir ?
A quoi sert un co-équipier ?
T'as pas une livre pour la machine ?
Les hôpitaux. Il faut qu'ils s'écroulent
avant qu'on les répare.
- Livre. Café.
- Merci !
Vous êtes en sécurité.
Mais dites-moi qui vous a fait ça.
La femme... dans l'appartement.
Ne la laissez pas m'approcher !
<i>Bipe le docteur. Pardon mademoiselle,
il faut qu'on l'allonge.</i>
- Dites-moi tout.
- Où suis-je ?
- Où est mon mari ?
- En sécurité.
- Comment ça ? Que lui avez-vous fait ?
- Rien pour le moment.
Dites-moi ce qu'il s'est passé.
C'est vous ou Mike, mais comment ?
C'est illégal de me traiter ainsi.
J'ai été cambriolée, attaquée !
Je veux un avocat, un coup de téléphone.
- Si vous m'accusez...
- Pas la peine de vous accuser.
Il n'y aura ni avocat, ni téléphone,
rien que nous dans cette salle.
Aussi longtemps qu'il faudra.
Dites-moi ce qu'il s'est passé !
Je lui ai dit, et à la police.
Je vous en prie, je ne sais pas !
Regardez-les.
Le deuxième vient de mourir.
"Ne la laissez pas m'approcher."
Ce sont ses derniers mots, pourquoi ?
Aucune idée, je ne l'ai pas touché.
- Vous protégez Mike ?
- Non !
Beth, ils vous ont attaqués.
Il serait compréhensible
que vous vous soyez défendue.
Un cas de légitime défense.
J'ignore ce qui leur est arrivé...
Mais je n'ai rien fait.
"Rien que nous dans cette salle,
aussi longtemps qu'il faudra ?"
Terrifiant.
- Vraiment ?
- Vraiment. J'en ai frissonné.
- On ne dirait pas.
- Le moment est passé.
- Tosh, le scanner corporel ?
- Tout est normal.
- Et la lumière ? C'était quoi ?
- Ca ne venait pas de nous.
Son champ électromagnétique a augmenté,
je ne vois pas comment c'est possible.
Il s'est passé la même chose à l'hosto.
C'est trop pour une coïncidence.
C'est elle, je le sais.
- Testons-la pour savoir ce qu'elle est.
- Je m'y mets.
Quel genre de tests ?
Rien de bien méchant. Prises de sang...
Des prises de sang ? Je suis innocente !
Ecoutez...
Je vous crois, mais c'est notre boulot.
Il s'est passé quelque chose cette nuit.
Il faut prouver que ce n'était pas vous.
- Ce n'était pas moi.
- Donc aucune raison de s'inquiéter.
Ils feront ces tests de toute façon.
Autant vous y soumettre. Allez.
Vous travaillez ici ?
Oui. Chaleureux, non ?
Mais vous êtes qui au juste ?
Vous n'avez pas de fenêtres !
Des fenêtres ? Moyen niveau discrétion.
- On ne renifle pas le résonneur.
- Désolée.
C'est énorme.
- C'est taré.
- Oui.
Je me sens soudain toute petite.
Allez.
Faisons ces tests, vous pourrez rentrer.
Viens Owen.
On va commencer par des prises
de sang, rien d'inquiétant.
Rien qu'une petite... aiguille.
- Quoi ?
- L'aiguille a cassé.
- Vous n'avez pas d'infirmière ?
- Il est médecin.
C'est pas possible si vous n'êtes
même pas cap... que faites-vous ?
Un essai.
Etes-vous déjà allée à l'hôpital ?
Je ne sais pas, je ne crois pas.
Pourquoi, qu'est-ce que j'ai ?
- Pas de chirurgie ? Des bilans ?
- Non, rien.
Dernière fois que vous avez été malade ?
Jamais. Je prends beaucoup
de vitamine C.
Plus que beaucoup.
Ni ampoule ni scalpel ne vous
résiste, de quelle planète venez-vous ?
La Terre.
Vous nous faites perdre notre temps !
Vous êtes un extra-terrestre !
Les extra-terrestres n'existent pas.
Beth, voici Janet.
Janet, Beth.
<i>- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Un extra-terrestre. Tout comme vous.</i>
<i>Impossible.</i>
Pas moi. Je travaille dans des bureaux.
Et les vagues électromagnétiques ?
Je ne sais pas ! Arrêtez !
Pourquoi vous faites ça ? Je veux Mike.
Je veux rentrer chez moi.
Qu'est-ce qu'il fait ?
Je ne sais pas.
C'est la première fois.
- Tout est vrai, c'est ça ?
- Oui.
Je ne comprends pas, pour
ma peau et tout le reste.
Comment puis-je vous le prouver ?
Comment vous prouver...
que je ne suis pas un extra-terrestre ?
- Interdit de l'utiliser, non ?
- Ce n'est qu'une sonde mentale.
- Après la dernière fois ?
- Ce n'était pas pareil.
La pression sanguine de cette
espèce était très élevée.
Leurs têtes doivent souvent exploser.
On ne devrait pas. Et si tu as tort ?
- Si elle est humaine elle mourra.
- J'ai raison.
- Il faut qu'on découvre son espèce.
- Du calme, Jack.
- On s'arrête dès que ça dérape.
- Ou dès que ça explose.
Amène-la nous.
- Pas trop serré ?
- Ca va.
- Ca ne risque vraiment rien ?
- Rien du tout.
Essayez de ne pas me tuer, d'accord ?
Il y a un risque de déshydratation.
Merci.
- On est prêt.
- La sonde perce votre conscient.
Donc ce qui se cache en dessous
va remonter à la surface.
Ca va faire mal ?
Oui.
Super contact, vraiment.
Il y a bien un genre de contact pour
lequel il est doué. A ce qu'on m'a dit.
Ca oui. Une fois, il a...
- OK, vous êtes prête ?
- J'imagine.
Lentement. Tosh contrôle la sonde,
Owen surveille vos signes vitaux,
Ianto vous donnera plus d'eau
et moi je serai là, OK ?
Et lui ? Que fait-il ?
J'observe.
Vous êtes prête, Beth ?
Bien.
Vas-y, Tosh.
Humaine.
- C'est bon.
- Qui a tué les voleurs ?
Je ne sais pas !
- C'est bon.
- De quelle planète venez-vous ?
Je suis humaine ! J'ai mal !
- Je vous en prie, arrêtez !
- Creuse plus profond.
- Tu es sûr ?
- Plus profond !
Les signes vitaux s'affolent,
mais c'est toujours bon.
Nouveau champ électromagnétique.
Qui a tué ces hommes ?
Je ne sais pas ! Arrêtez !
- Je t'en prie, arrête !
- Plus profond.
- C'est bon.
- Plus profond !
Les lampes !
- Le champ magnétique !
- Elle ne tiendra pas beaucoup plus !
On doit s'arrêter !
Mon dieu !
Mieux vaut ne pas s'approcher.
Toshiko, que s'est-il passé ?
C'était un compartiment caché.
Elle n'en était pas consciente.
Qui êtes vous ?
Kayehla janees, putaak graszh,
ish nin fas du hap vac nal.
D'où venez-vous ?
Kayehla janees, putaak graszh,
ish nin fas du hap vac nal.
Vous aimez mes bottes ?
Kayehla janees, putaak graszh,
ish nin fas du hap vac nal.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle dit ?
Son nom, rang, numéro de série.
C'est tout ce qu'elle nous dira.
Qu'est-ce que tu en sais ?
Je sais qui elle est
et pourquoi elle est là.
- Eteins la sonde.
- Sonde éteinte.
Vous ne mentiez pas. Ca fait mal !
Alors ?
C'est un agent dormant. J'ai
compris quand j'ai vu l'implant.
Un agent dormant ? Pour qui ?
Personne ne sait, il n'y
a jamais de survivants.
Désignation officielle : cellule 114.
Ils infiltrent les planètes, adaptant
leur corps, rassemblant des info,
parfois des années durant, observant,
jusqu'à ce qu'ils soient prêts.
OK, ça fait peur.
Avec de la chance, c'est la première.
Ils envoient un éclaireur
pour recueillir des info.
Avec de faux souvenirs
pour mieux s'intégrer.
Elle ne sait pas du tout
qu'elle n'est pas humaine.
Son vrai "elle" a dû prendre
le dessus pour tuer les voleurs.
- Autodéfense.
- Je te l'avais dit.
Au moment où ils attaquent, ils
savent absolument tout sur la planète.
L'implant réunit des informations,
indécelables aux rayons X.
Elle projette une fausse image.
Toutes ces données sont à l'intérieur.
Un générateur de champ de force crée
une fine couche imperméable sur la peau.
C'est pourquoi l'aiguille
ne pouvait pas rentrer.
Ils ont même des info sur nous.
Ils en savent plus que moi sur cet
endroit. Personne n'en sait plus.
Et si elle n'est pas seule ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire ?
Pour commencer...
On devrait le lui dire.
<i>Kayehla janees, putaak graszh,
ish nin fas du hap vac nal.</i>
<i>D'où venez-vous ?</i>
<i>Kayehla janees, putaak graszh...</i>
Vous pouvez arrêter ça ?
- Je les ai tués, alors ?
- Oui.
Et je suis un
extra-terrestre meurtrier ?
- Oui.
- Toute ma vie...
tous ces souvenirs, ça
ne peut pas être faux.
Je sais que j'aime Mike.
- Et qu'il m'aime.
- Et c'est le cas.
Alors qu'est-ce qui est réel ?
Vous l'êtes,
vous êtes vraiment amoureux.
Vous vous sentez humaine ?
- Oui.
- Alors vous l'êtes.
C'est notre esprit ou notre corps
qui fait de nous des humains ?
Et quand le déguisement tombera ?
Je veux avoir des enfants.
Se sentir humain suffira ?
Vous pouvez me faire devenir humaine ?
Non. Vous finirez par vous activer.
Vos vrais souvenirs
reviendront, et Beth disparaîtra.
Comment ça, m'activer ?
Vous renverrez les info chez
vous et commencerez l'invasion.
Vous devez pouvoir faire quelque chose.
Toute cette technologie,
tout ce que vous faites...
Vous pouvez pas m'enfermer
à côté de ce truc !
- Vous allez me tuer ?
- Non. Bien sûr que non.
Vous avez tué d'autres
extra-terrestres ?
Seulement en dernier recours.
Tuer ou être tué.
J'aurais aimé que ça n'arrive pas.
Ne l'avoir jamais su.
Avoir une vie normale.
- Jusqu'au jour de l'attaque.
- Je ne ferai rien. Ce n'est pas moi !
Désolé, mais si.
On ne peut pas la relâcher,
elle est trop dangereuse.
On pourrait la congeler. Avec
les cryogéniques extra-terrestres.
La réveiller si on trouve
un moyen de l'arrêter.
- La congeler ? Combien de temps ?
- Autant que nécessaire.
- Au moins elle serait en vie.
- Son implant marcherait encore.
- On peut le désactiver ?
- Je peux griller le transmetteur.
Pour l'instant, il ne transmet rien.
J'ai vérifié chaque fréquence 5 fois.
Ils risquent de se rendre
compte qu'on est dessus ?
Non. En la congelant, elle ne s'activera
jamais et ils n'en sauront rien.
Et le mari ?
Elle devra totalement disparaître.
Aucun au revoir.
On avait prévu un voyage.
Rien de spécial, juste un week-end.
- Je le reverrai un jour ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Oh, ces hommes...
Oh mon dieu, les pauvres.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Vos vrais souvenirs détruisent
votre fausse identité.
Le plus tôt sera le
mieux, pour tout le monde.
Venez.
Promettez-moi que si vous
ne trouvez pas de solution,
vous ne me réveillerez pas.
Eteignez juste la machine.
Je ne peux pas vous promettre ça.
OK, vous. Vous pourrez.
- Ne me laissez blesser personne.
- Promis.
J'ai toujours eu ce sentiment
de ne pas être à ma place.
désespérant d'avoir
une vie plus excitante.
- Je vais désactiver le transmetteur.
- Vous ne sentirez rien.
Ca supprimera aussi le champ de force,
je devrais les congeler tous les deux.
Allez-y. Je ne veux
pas être invincible.
Ensuite, je vous endormirai
puis je vous congèlerai
Ca sera comme aller vous coucher.
En un peu plus froid.
- Au revoir, Gwen.
- Au revoir.
C'est fait.
"Vous voulez pas tout le
siège, tant que vous y êtes ?"
Et j'ai dit : "Pourquoi ne pas
faire descendre tous les passagers ?"
"Et vous aurez le wagon pour vous
toute seule. Ca vous plairait ?"
- C'est pas vrai !
- Si. Je me suis fait remarquer.
Pas pu m'en empêcher,
ça m'a vraiment énervé.
Elle m'a jeté un de ces regards, et...
David ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Ton bras ?
Où tu vas ?
Tu me fais peur !
Qu'est-ce qu'il t'arrive ? Reviens là !
C'est bon.
Je l'envoie aux coffres.
- Bon sang, qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
- Merde !
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Beth est partie.
- Elle était congelée !
- Oui ! Ses constantes étaient à zéro.
Vérification du système...
Qu'est-ce qu'elle a fait ?
Un virus, une quarantaine ?
Non, elle a éteint les lumières.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle a avec les ampoules ?
- Elle a pris les tunnels.
- Faudrait changer les serrures...
Elle savait tout de l'endroit, dans son
bras. Tunnels, plans, codes d'accès...
Elle aurait pu tout couper,
tout faire exploser !
- Mais non.
- Je jure qu'elle était congelée.
- Tosh, tu as éteint le transmetteur ?
- Oui.
- Sûre ?
- Oui, jusque là.
- Peut-être une autre projection.
- Attendez.
Tout était faux. Ses constantes
étaient une projection.
Elle peut tromper l'équipement,
nous faire voir ce qu'on veut,
un battement de coeur rapide, on essaye
de le congeler et ça fait le contraire.
Il faudrait énormément
d'énergie pour simuler tout ça.
Ca explique l'énorme champ magnétique.
Et les ampoules qui
grillent quand elle s'énerve.
Alors on l'a activée ?
Impossible, on serait tous morts.
On l'a laissée s'échapper.
Elle a quelque chose à faire.
Comment tu te sens ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
Personne ne me dit rien.
- Ca va ?
- Oui.
Tu sais que je t'aime ?
Bien sûr, je t'aime aussi.
- Promis ?
- Pourquoi ?
Je dois être sûre.
Je dois partir.
Comment ça ? Où ?
Je ne peux pas le dire,
mais c'est pour ton bien.
Beth, de quoi tu parles ?
Désolée. Je dois m'éloigner de toi.
Sinon... Je vais te faire du mal.
Ca me fait mal. Fais pas ça.
Quoi qu'il arrive...
sache juste que je t'aime...
et que je t'aimerai toujours.
Si tu as fait quelque
chose, je m'en fiche.
- Ne me quitte pas. On s'en sortira.
- Pas cette fois.
Je dois mettre ça au clair,
et je ne peux pas près de toi.
- Je t'aime trop pour ça.
- Ne laisse pas la police te prendre.
Je te laisserai pas partir.
Peu importe ce que t'as fait...
- C'était quoi ?
- Je ne sais pas. On dirait...
A l'aide !
S'il vous plaît ! Un docteur !
A l'aide !
- S'il vous plaît !
- Qu'est-ce que...
S'il vous plaît !
- Beth !
- Désolée...
C'était un accident, je
voulais lui dire au revoir...
Elle a une arme dans le bras.
C'est bon.
Ca empire. Elle perd le
contrôle, on doit vite l'arrêter.
Allez, Beth. On vous ramène.
- Non !
- Allez ! Debout !
Quoi d'autre à l'école, aujourd'hui ?
Alex a une petite amie.
- Pas vrai !
- Oh si.
- Elle s'appelle Jessica.
- Je vais te tuer.
- Patrick Grainger ?
- Alex, ne tue pas ta soeur.
Pas avant d'avoir goûté.
Oh mon dieu, arrêtez !
Laissez-le !
Ne touchez pas mes enfants !
Pitié !
Chauffard ! Remonte dans ton
camion ou j'te le fous dans le cul !
Merde !
Tosh ? On l'a. C'est fini. On arrive.
Ca va ?
Oui, je crois.
- C'était quoi ?
- Un camion citerne.
Quelqu'un voulait détruire
la route M4 pour...
Non ! C'est pas la route, mais
un tuyau d'essence souterrain.
C'est l'approvisionnement
militaire, utilisé en cas d'urgence.
Plus maintenant. Attends.
Un rapport arrive.
- Patrick Grainger a été assassiné.
- Qui ?
Le chef du Conseil, poignardé plusieurs
fois à la poitrine et à la tête.
- Ca te dit quelque chose ?
- Pourquoi on voudrait sa mort ?
Il est aussi coordonnateur de la ville,
qui s'occupe des situations d'urgence.
- Il a tous les codes de sécurité.
- Comment tu le sais ?
Je sais tout.
Et c'est marqué sur l'écran.
Ils mettent tout en place.
Gwen, prends-la. Tosh, Owen,
c'est parti. Ils font ça maintenant.
Tosh ? Il n'y a pas qu'elle.
Il y a toute une cellule,
et ils sont activés.
C'est parti.
- Dites-moi comment l'arrêter !
- C'est impossible.
- Réfléchissez !
- Beth, regardez-moi !
- Comment arrêter ça ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Je suis déconnectée de la cellule.
Je ne connais pas la mission. Désolée.
Et votre implant. Comment
vous êtes sortie de Torchwood ?
La technologie est en moi. Je
peux l'allumer et l'utiliser.
Vous pouvez le faire
maintenant ? Pister la cellule ?
Non ! Et si ça se passait mal ?
Si vous ne le faites pas, d'autres
mourront. Pas seulement Mike.
Il n'en reste plus qu'un.
- Je peux le localiser.
- Allons-y.
Attendez, j'ai une idée.
Non. Je ne peux rien faire ! Le réseau
téléphonique est complètement mort !
- Et une connexion portable ?
- Tout le réseau est mort.
Portables, fixes, boîtes
de conserve avec ficelle.
Tout. Absolument tout. Tout est mort.
Allô ? Y'a quelqu'un ? Non,
car il n'y a plus de téléphone.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- La radio CB.
Ils ont planté les téléphones, mais
pas les ondes radio. Pas encore.
- Et si...
- On ne peut pas contacter Jack !
- Impossible !
- Tosh, Owen, vous m'entendez ?
- Dieu merci. Alors ?
- Il y a une cellule active.
Quatre dont Beth, deux sont
morts. On est après le dernier.
- Si on le rattrape, c'est bon.
- Qu'est-ce que je peux faire ?
Il se dirige vers une ferme abandonnée.
Dis-moi ce qu'il y a là bas.
Où va-t-il ?
Il n'y a rien.
Rien à la surface.
- Il y est presque. Dépêchons-nous.
- Oui, merci.
- Que va-t-il se passer ?
- Comment avez-vous amené vos armes ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je crois qu'on a que ce truc au bras.
Comment allez-vous nous
envahir aussi vite ?
Je ne sais pas. J'ai appris à me
servir de ce truc aujourd'hui.
Ca remonte à loin. Il y avait une
mine de charbon sur la falaise.
L'armée l'a fermé dans les années
40, on ne sait pas pourquoi.
Je peux peut-être entrer
dans les fichiers de l'armée.
Voyons, les gars, c'était
même pas dur. Vous me décevez.
C'est presque obscène, ce que
tu fais aux systèmes de sécurité.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- La mine.
L'armée l'utilisait comme entrepôt.
Des têtes nucléaires. Il y en a 10.
- Personne n'est censé le savoir.
- Ça commence comme ça.
- Pas d'artillerie lourde.
- Pas besoin, ils utilisent la nôtre !
On a laissé la clé sous le paillasson.
Ils n'ont eu qu'à se servir.
- Tu peux arrêter ça ?
- On fait ce qu'on peut.
Si non, on ne sentira rien.
On sera au centre de l'explosion.
- Rassurant.
- Allez, un peu d'espoir !
Avec un superbe héros comme
moi, comment échouer ?
Il est superbe, on doit
bien reconnaître ça.
- Et s'ils échouent ?
- Ils y arriveront.
- Oui, mais sinon ?
- Alors, ça sera fini.
Faisons tous l'amour.
Et je croyais que la fin du
monde ne pouvait pas empirer.
<i>Halte ! Arrêtez-vous !</i>
<i>Sortez, maintenant !</i>
<i>Face contre terre !</i>
<i>A terre ou on tire !</i>
<i>Feu !</i>
- On a pensé à cette étape du plan ?
- Ça va pas être joli, préparez-vous.
- Comment va-t-on l'arrêter, Jack ?
- Comme ça.
C'était pas censé arriver
aujourd'hui. Comment on l'arrête ?
Peu importe.
Vous ne pouvez pas nous arrêter.
On connaît votre faiblesse.
On vous connaît, Jack Harkness.
On sait tout de vous et de Torchwood.
On a eu beaucoup d'informations
avant que vous la débranchiez.
Vous serez pris en
compte dans nos plans.
- Gwen ?
- Presque.
C'est bon. Désactivé.
Pas la peine,
votre transmetteur est mort.
- Tout comme le champ de force.
- Vous mentez.
Ah bon ?
Incluez ça dans vos plans.
Les autres arriveront quand ?
Ils sont déjà là.
Je ne vous laisserai pas me prendre.
Courez !
C'est fait.
- D'accord, mais ça me plaît pas.
- Fais juste ce que tu as à faire.
Les cryogéniques sont prêts,
c'est quand vous voulez.
Ça marchera, cette fois ?
Tosh a reconfiguré le coffre.
Ça s'occupera de l'implant.
- Plus de projections.
- Une minute plus tard et...
C'est pas le cas.
- On l'a arrêté.
- Et quand vous devrez m'arrêter ?
- Si l'hibernation ne marchait pas ?
- Ça n'arrivera pas.
Je le sens arriver. Ça veut sortir.
Qu'est-ce que vous ferez quand
je ne serai plus moi-même ?
On trouvera quelque chose, Beth.
Non.
Je suis trop dangereuse,
vous le savez très bien.
Vous avez quelqu'un,
chez vous ?
Un fiancé.
Vous lui avez déjà fait du mal ?
Plus d'une fois, oui.
Vous vous rappelez de
cette culpabilité ?
Imaginez ça, multiplié par un milliard.
Tout le temps...
Chaque seconde qui s'écoule.
C'est ce que je ressens.
Et le pire, c'est que quand
je me transformerai,
je ne me sentirai plus coupable.
Je ne penserai qu'à ma mission.
Je me ficherai de Mike.
J'oublierai tout de lui.
Je ne veux pas mourir en
étant une de ces choses.
- Je ne veux pas oublier Mike.
- Alors ne l'oubliez pas.
Allons-y. Qui sait ce qu'on pourra
faire dans un mois, un an ?
Merci d'être si gentille.
Rappelez-vous de moi maintenant.
Rappelez-vous de Beth.
Beth...
Beth...
Je ne vous laisserai pas me congeler !
Je vous tuerai tous !
Lâchez-là !
Non ! Attends, ne tire pas !
C'est une ruse. Elle me fera rien.
Ecartez-vous d'elle !
Calmez-vous tous !
Beth, vous ne voulez pas faire ça.
Laissez Gwen partir.
Je la tuerai d'abord, puis vous tous,
et le reste de votre misérable espèce !
Beth, s'il vous plaît !
Ils vous tueront.
Vous avez prouvé votre valeur.
Vous nous avez aidés
à arrêter l'invasion.
Vous pouvez être humaine !
Pas assez humaine.
Au revoir, Gwen.
Bonne chance !
Elle voulait que vous tiriez !
Elle s'est servie de sa dernière part
d'humanité pour faire ça.
On pouvait pas prendre le risque.
Elle devait le savoir.
Elle le savait.
Elle a voulu nous rendre
la tâche plus facile.
Tu penses qu'on l'a arrêté ?
Peut-être. Ou bien on l'a juste retardé.
Je ne sais pas.
- On ne sait rien.
- On en sait beaucoup.
On sait pour l'implant.
On sait désactiver le champ de force.
On connaît leur attaque.
On sait qu'ils peuvent être tués.
Ils pensent avoir l'élément de surprise,
on sait qu'ils ne l'ont pas.
En attendant, on continue
à faire ce qu'on fait.
0h, on redemande de
la baston, je vois, Gwen.
- Alors, tu as fixé une date ?
- Oh, me lance pas, pitié.
J'ai déjà ma mère au téléphone.
" Et l'église du quartier ?
Elle est toujours si belle."
Rentre.
Continue à faire ce qu'on fait.
Bonne nuit, Jack.
<i>C'est un soldat de 1918, congelé.</i>
- On le réveille tous les ans.
- Laissez-moi !
- C'est moi. Toshiko.
- C'est à nouveau l'heure ?
<i>Deux époques différentes ne devraient
jamais exister en même temps.</i>
Vous ne devriez pas être là !
<i>Des bouts de 1918 vont
apparaître à l'hôpital.</i>
On a quelques fantômes.
Vous devriez venir avec nous.
Il doit être à l'hôpital, prêt à passer
d'une époque à l'autre.
- Tu es le seul à pouvoir arrêter ça.
- Pourquoi moi ?
<i>Ce n'est pas des années dans le futur.
C'est maintenant.</i>

Torchwood.
'Outside the
Government, beyond the police.
'Fighting for the future
on behalf ofthe human race.
'The 21st century is
when everything changes...
'And Torchwood is ready.
' Nothing so far.
You getting anything on that?
Well, hold on a tick.
Yes, follow me, Gerald.
Well?
We're pretty close.
This way.
Don't panic.
I thought you were a ghost.
Scared the wits out of me!
Sorry.
Thought you'd be used to
us creeping around by now.
Have you seen any recently?
Ghosts.
I've seen three today.
It's getting worse.
Well, you're a very brave girl.
Thank you, sir.
Where did you see them?
In the ward.
St Teilo's Militry Hospital
Mind, half of this lot see things anyway.
Nerves shot to pieces. Poor chaps.
Soon as they're better, they'll
be sent back to the Front.
Field Marshal Haig's order.
'Every position must
be held to the last man.
'Each one of us must
fight on to the end.
' Whenever that is.
Gerald.
Come on.
We're right on top of it!
Hello?
Tell them.
Tell us what?
Tell them what to do.
You're the only one who can stop this.
If you don't, it's the end of everything!
Tommy!
Take me.
I'm in there in the ward, in 1918.
You have to take me
so I can be here now.
just take me!
- Tommy, you'd better come with us.
- Why?
Don't worry.
I'm Gerald and this is Harriet.
We'll look after you.
Who are you?
We're Torchwood.

Who is he?
Thomas Reginald Brockless.
Tommy.
24 years-old.
Sort of.
Well, he's either 24 or he's not.
Depends how you work it out.
All right, when was he born?
Owen, you ready?
Yeah, nearly.
Is that a dress, Tosh?
I do believe it is, Owen.
Well, where is he?
He's been here for 90
years, longer than any of us.
Any of you.
Torchwood have used alien
cryogenics since Victorian times.
They froze Tommy in 1918.
So he's 24 or 114 years old.
I know which one I'd choose.
We have to wake him up
every 12 months or so.
Well, defrost him.
One day only, then back in the freezer.
Why?
Check he still works.
One day, we're gonna need him.
Right, everybody ready?
Come on, Tommy.
Charging 200, clear!
Charging 360. Clear!
Gwen, quick. It's all right!
Get off me, leave me alone.
- Tommy!
- Leave me alone!
Tommy!
Tommy, listen to me!
Tommy Brockless!
It's me, Toshiko.
Toshiko.
Remember?
Gets harder every year.
Good left hook, though.
Do you know where you are?
Torchwood.
That's right.
Is it time again?
Blimey.
How are you feeling?
HE COUGHS I could murder a cup of tea.
Don't expect the best china.
I'm starving.
Here, tuck in. There's
enough to feed an army.
Nice dress.
Thank you.
Got your slacks on
underneath. Is it that cold?
It's the fashion this year.
1968, they were in miniskirts.
Thought all my Christmases
had come at once.
Shame they haven't made a comeback.
I still don't get it. Why is he here?
Like I said
- one day, we're gonna need him.
And pull to me.
Good. Seems fine.
- Ijust need to take a few blood samples.
- Blood samples.
We wake you up once a year and
stick needles into you, it's not fair.
Once a year for you, it's
every day for me.
So, while we wait.
Tommy Reginald Brockless, born 1894
February the 7th in Blackley, Manchester.
Private officer in 10th
West Yorkshire regiment.
Very good.
Only son of Constance
May Bassett, died 1900,
and Thomas Campbell
Brockless, died june 1931, aged 57.
Heart attack.
That's right, isn't it?
Yes. I'm sorry.
It's all right.
Ijust haven't had that
much time to get used to it.
Right, I need to have a look at this leg.
St Teilo's Hospital, 1918.
There was a time-shift.
A fracture in the rift means that two
slices of time were erupting into each other.
A slice of 1918, and?
A slice ofthe future.
But we don't know exactly what slice.
It could be tomorrow, it
could be in 100 years' time.
What will happen?
Chunks of 1918 will start
to appear at the hospital.
A few at first, then more and more.
When the time-shift is
complete, it'll start a chain reaction.
Unless we stop it, time-shifts'll start happening
all over the country, then all over the world.
But how does Tommy fit in?
He helps to stop it somehow.
Torchwood 1918 left us sealed orders.
'Eyes-only documents.
'FA0 Torchwood commander
overseeing case 1918/T B.
Tommy Brockless?
It's stuck.
- No, it's locked.
- OK, where's the key?
temporal lock tied in with the
rift frequencies at the hospital.
***the box will open and we'll
find out exactly what Tommy does.
But why would they keep
us in the dark, jack?
I guess we'll find that out, too.
Seriously, what do you think?
You look like a film star.
Who, Charlie Chaplin?
Come on.
Have you got any more of those
pretty boys in the freezer?
Hands off, missy. Tosh got there first.
Thanks for holding
the fort while I'm out.
No worries, have fun.
Be careful.
Where are you off?
Drink, film, maybe a pizza.
Oh, very nice.
I'll be on the mobile if you need me.
- Have a lovely time.
- Bye!
He's a frozen soldier from 1918.
Nobody's perfect.
Slow down, what's the hurry?
I've only got one day, I
want to see everything.
Captain Scott...
sailed from here, when he
went off to the Antarctic.
1910.
I was 16, papers were full of it.
Took him two years to get
there and then he snuffed it.
So, what've you been up
to since I last saw you?
This and that.
Work, mostly.
What?
I knew you were going to say that.
It's what you always say.
So how's the piano playing going?
That's what you said last year.
'I'm gonna learn the piano.
' Never got round to it.
I bet you never learnt Spanish, neither.
I bought a book, though!
Oh, are you made of money?
I haven't had time.
You talk about your life like
you've got no control over it.
Well, Torchwood's pretty much 24/7.
24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
But you weren't conscripted.
I mean, it's your choice, right?
Yeah... I suppose it is.
He's a bit of all right.
He's the boss.
Nothing changes.
She's all right, too.
Harriet Derbyshire.
Wonder what happened to her.
She died the year after that was taken.
26 years old.
So young.
They all were.
Nothing changes.
Where are you going?
St Teilo's Hospital.
And bloody cheer up, will you?
Good shot!
You're still winning.
It's alljust maths, really.
Angles, velocity...
Give you women a vote, equal
rights, look what happens, eh?
So, er, you got a boyfriend yet?
You sound like my mother.
Ah, so you haven't, then.
You had a girlfriend? In 1918.
Yeah. Ellie.
We courted for two years.
What happened?
I, er, stopped seeing her...
last time I was home on leave.
The war changed me.
I couldn'tjust carry on like before.
I'm sorry.
Right pair we make.
Hello?
I said hello.
Can you hear me?
Look, can you hear me? If you just...
Hello?
Are you all right, love?
You look as if you've seen a ghost.
They're knocking down the hospital?
Yeah, that's what they said.
Could that have
triggered the time-shift?
Could have.
Maybe all the psychic trauma and rift
energy charged it up like a battery.
1918, this place was
full of wounded soldiers.
They had four years of it.
Passchendaele, the Somme.
A million British soldiers
killed during the Great War.
It was like walking into hell.
Believe me.
I was there.
Owen? You got anything?
All quiet here.
just that little spike from earlier.
This is more Tosh's thing than mine.
Shalll give her a call?
Not yet.
just keep watching.
Yes, mate.
Half a bitter, and a vodka and diet
tonic with a slice of lemon, please.
***
Seems like there's
always a war somewhere.
That's not exactly a war.
Looks like one.
First year they woke me up...
1919...
they told me it was all over.
We won.
'The war to end all wars, ' they said.
And then three weeks later, you
had the Second World War.
After all that.
Do you never wonder
if we're worth saving?
The human race.
Yes.
I think we're worth saving.
Wars and all.
What?
What?
I wasjust thinking...
I'd do anything for you.
Yeah, all you have to do is say, 'Tommy, you're
my brave, handsome hero, and I need you.'
Is that all?
And whatever it is, I'll do it.
I mean it. Anything.
What is it?
I dunno.
I just felt something...
Jack?
jack.
# Tick-tock, wind up the clock #
# I like them all...#
I bet you say that to all the girls.
# Show me a skirt, and my
brain simply whirls...#
Matron won't have singing.
You'll get a good telling
off if she hears you.
# I love their dimples and curls #
# Tick-tock, wind up the clock #
# And I start my day over again #
# Tick-tock, wind up the clock #
# And I start my day over again...#
jack, you see anything?
'Cos I've got a little
mountain range this end.
' Yeah, we've got a few ghosts here.
'Gwen, you OK?
'Gwen?
' I'm fine.
They're ready for you now.
Hello?
Hello?
I see you.
Why won't you leave us alone?
You shouldn't be here!
I don't mean you any harm.
You shouldn't be here!
You shouldn't be here!
I don't mean you any harm.
I'm going to get you!
Stop, stop, no.
- Please, no, Tommy, no.Stop!
- I'm putting you down.
I'm putting you down.
What?
Nothing.
Thanks.
Thanks?
Itjust caught me out.
- It doesn't matter.
- What?
I know it's silly...
but I'm a bit older than you.
I was born in 1894.
You know what I mean.
So I'm old enough to die for my country
but I'm too young to give you a kiss?
You daft lass.
What goes on in that head of yours?
Thanks.
You're welcome.
I might be young, but I've
seen a fair bit in my time.
So what do you want to do now?
Well, we could go back to mine but there's
only room for one and it's bloody freezing.
You want to come back to my place?
I'm hardly rushing you.
You've known me four years.
Four days...
OK.
Let's go.
I'll race you, come on!
jack.
Toshiko!
We're on our way.
Demolishing the hospital is
what triggers the time-shift.
So, don't demolish it.
Too late, it's already started.
What happens next?
Two different times should
never exist simultaneously.
You want to be in 1918, or now.
Not both.
So when 1918 becomes fully manifest...
It's really going to screw us up.
OK.
Linear time.
Screwed up time.
Imagine your life as a straight
line, from birth to death.
Try drawing that line on the
paper without straightening it out.
It's impossible.
That's why we've got to stop it.
Ianto, is that box doing anything yet?
Still locked.
We need to find out how fast
the time-shift is happening.****
Tosh, Owen, go to the
hospital, we need readings.
Cover the place with rift monitors.
Gwen, go through the files, see
if there's anything we missed.
Need a hand?
just a couple more.
Listen, Tosh, I've been meaning to say...
just be careful.
What do you mean?
You're very close to Tommy.
I've only known him for four days.
Yeah.
You've fallen for him, haven't you?
I can be myself with him.
I don't have to pretend.
No, I understand.
I didn't think you had some
weird fetish for defrosted men.
Ijust, um...
I don't want you to
get hurt, that's all...
if you have to say goodbye.
'0wen, can you hear me?
' What is it?
'I need you to go down into the east wing
of the hospital, 'head for the second floor,
what used to be the radiology section.
'I think that area contains
a clue to the time-shift.
'I read this earlier, but
it didn't make any sense.
' In the Torchwood 1918
field report at the hospital,
they describe a certain
detail of their encounter.
It reads...
'Through a hole in the external
wall, we hear the roar of great engines.
'Outside is a woman in strange
armour, ripping a Union jack,
'perhaps some future
heroine ofthe Empire.
' What does it mean?
'It doesn't sound like us, now.
' The time-shift has started, but maybe it
doesn't complete until years in the future.
Got it!
It's some kind of advert...
for car insurance.
'That sound they heard
must have been traffic.
' It's not years in the future...
it's now.
Instructions?
Yeah, for Tommy.
And Toshiko.
In 12 hours, there'll be a brief moment when
both times exist before the time-shift completes,
when Tommy can be here now, and in 1918.
He needs to be in the hospital, ready
to step from one time to another.
So he'd be right inside the time-shift?
And he can close the
fracture that caused it.
And when the fracture's closed?
1918'll be back where it belongs.
So will I.
For good?
Yeah.
You're the only one who can do this.
We brought you from 1918 to
now, and when you go back to 1918,
your life will be like a
thread, stitching time back together again.
A stitch in time.
How?
This is a rift manipulator.
It's basically a key.
Once you're inside the time-shift, you
can close the door behind you.
And that's it?
I'm gone?
Tommy, stay with Ianto.
Tosh? With me.
What happens to him?
Three weeks after we
send Tommy back, he dies.
How?
He's shot by a firing squad.
I don't understand.
In 1918, Tommy was
suffering from shell shock.
That's why he was in the hospital.
When Torchwood took him and froze
him, they froze his most recent memories.
When he returns to 1918, he'll
revert back to who he was.
He'll be shell-shocked
and so he'll be executed by
the British Army for cowardice.
They can't shoot him for that.
Lots of soldiers who were shell-shocked
recovered enough to be sent back to the Front.
But once they were there...
they broke down again.
So they kill him?
More than 300 of them.
Then we can't send him back.
- We have to.
- I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
He trusts you.
To send him to his death?
To help him save the future.
It has to be you.
We've kept these in the archives.
You were wearing them in the
hospital when Torchwood took you.
Good job the moths
haven't got into them.
So I'll be saving the
world in some pyjamas?
How daft is that?
Torchwood 1918 saw you with Tommy in
the hospital, telling him what to do.
I know you.
You're strong enough to do this.
Does Tommy know what happens to him?
No.
If he asks me, what do I say?
Where's Toshiko?
Still in with jack.
so
TOITIOITOW |T|0|â€™|â€™Ii|â€™IQ.
What time is it now?
Ten to nine.
So what do we do till then?
You don't know, do you?
What would you like to do?
The night before we went over
the top, we used to play cards,
write letters, have a
drink, if anyone had some.
Well, we could do that.
Yeah.
But you're not coming with me.
I'm going on my own.
We were just wondering what
Tommy should do tonight.
He can come home with me.
He's not our prisoner, he
doesn't have to stay here.
Does he?
No.
If that's what you both want.
Tomorrow morning, 6.30.
Come in.
You're very neat.
Yes.
Well, there's only me here.
And me.
just for tonight.
Then I'll be gone.
I never thought it would really happen.
I won't even be able to write to you.
You're going to be so far away.
I worried you'd see me getting older.
This time tomorrow, he'll
be back in 1918.
In his own time.
Would you go back to
yours? If you could?
Why, would you miss me?
Yep.
I left home a long time ago.
I don't really know
where I really belong.
Maybe that doesn't matter any more.
I know you get lonely.
Going home wouldn't fix that.
Being here, I've seen things
I never dreamt I'd see.
Loved people I never would have
known if I'd just stayed where I was.
And I wouldn't change
that for the world.
What did he tell you?
What happens to me?
They send you back to France.
Then what?
Do they find my body?
That's something.
It's time.
You know we can't be
here when it happens.
Come on.
We're safe for now.
Are you all right?
Tommy!
Where is she?
In1918?
'Tommy, Ithink you'd better come with us.
'Don't worry.
I'm Gerald, this is Harriet.
'We'll look after y0u.
' Torchwood took me.
'Tommy!
' Tommy!
Stay here.
I won't do it.
I can't go back.
- You've got to.
- No!
I know what'll happen.
They'll send me back to the
Front, I'll be back in the trenches.
Help me.
You've got to go.
Why me?
You're no better than the generals.
Sitting safely behind the
lines, sending us over the top.
Any one of you could
go, but you're sending me.
We belong here.
I'm sorry.
I've been shoved from pillar to post
all my life by the Army, by Torchwood.
All this time I've had, it means nothing.
- Tommy.
- Get off.
- Tommy, get up.
- No!
Leave us alone. Please.
You've got two minutes.
Listen, you're a hero.
Do you know that?
Because you stop the
time-shift and save everyone.
You save us all.
I can't do it.
We need you.
I don't want to be a hero.
I want to stay here with you.
Hello?
Tell them.
Tell us what?
Tell them what to do.
You're the only one who can stop this.
If you don't, if you don't, it's
the end of everything.
Tommy!
Take me.
I'm in there in the ward in 1918.
You have to take me
so I can be here now.
just take me!
I'll be gone soon.
Remember...
the rift key. Use it.
You've got to get back into bed.
Like y0u've never been away.
Then use the key.
Tommy?
Remember.
It's nearly time.
What are you doing?
You shouldn't be in here.
Go, go!
Come on!
- Tommy, Ithink you'd better come with us.
- Why?
Don't worry. I'm Gerald, this is Harriet.
We'll look after you.
Who are you?
We're Torchwood.
Where are we going?
Somewhere safe. Trust me.
Keep going.
Don't look back.
You should be in bed.
Still warm, at least.
Not been gone long.
What's happening?
I don't know.
The time-shift hasn't stopped.
Toshiko, show me the city, now!
It's spreading out from the hospital.
What the hell are they?
- the past, erupting into the present.
They're everywhere.
What about the rift key?
Tommy isn't using it.
Why not?
I don't know.
Because he'sjust gone back to 90
years ago, because he's shell-shocked?
One of us will have to go back.
jack, wait!
You'll get stuck in 1918.
I've got an idea.
The time-shift's forcing the rift open.
We can use it to our advantage.
A tiny amount should do.
We know Tommy's exact location in time.
If we send an image of
you through to him...
I can go into Tommy's mind.
As a psychic projection, if we're lucky.
And Tommy will be able to see you.
I can make him use the key.
Let me do it.
He trusts me.
OK.
How long have I got?
Minutes.
You've got one shot, Tosh.
That's all.
All right?
Tommy.
Tommy. Tommy.
She's found him.
It's me.
Toshiko.
Who?
I'm hereto help you.
Is this yours?
No.
Do you know what it is?
Tommy, it's a key.
You have to use it.
I'm scared.
It's all right.
That's why I'm here.
I'm a coward.
No, you are not.
What am I fighting for?
For the future, for me.
Because you're my brave, handsome hero.
Tommy, use the key.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
It's all right.
He did it.
Thank you.
He trusted me right to the end.
Because you were strong.
All of this.
is still here because of you.
Because of Tommy.
Let's hope we're worth it.

Torchwood.
Au delà du gouvernement et de la police.
Ils se battent pour
le futur de l'humanité.
C'est au 21ème siècle que tout bascule.
Et Torchwood est prêt.
Rien pour l'instant.
Vous ne captez rien ?
Donnez-moi un moment.
Oui, suivez-moi, Gerald.
Eh bien ?
Nous sommes tout près.
Par ici.
Pas de panique !
J'ai cru à un fantôme !
Vous m'avez fait une de ces peurs.
Désolé.
Vous devriez être
habituée à nous voir ici.
En avez-vous vus
récemment ? Des fantômes.
Trois aujourd'hui !
C'est de pire en pire.
Vous êtes bien courageuse.
Merci monsieur.
Où les avez-vous vus ?
Dans le dortoir.
Hôpital Militaire de St Teilo.
La moitié d'entre eux
hallucinent de toute façon.
Nerfs endommagés. Les pauvres.
Dès qu'ils vont mieux,
on les renvoie au front.
Ordres du Maréchal Haig.
Chaque position doit être
tenue tant qu'il reste un homme.
Chacun d'entre nous doit
combattre jusqu'à la fin.
Peu importe quand elle advient.
Gerald.
Allez.
Nous sommes pile dessus !
Bonsoir ?
Dis-leur.
Nous dire quoi ?
Dis-leur ce qu'il faut faire.
Tu es le seul qui puisse tout empêcher.
Sans toi, tout est fini !
Tommy !
Emmenez-moi.
Je suis dans le dortoir, en 1918.
Vous devez m'emmener pour
que je sois ici, maintenant.
Emmenez-moi, c'est tout !
- Vous devriez venir avec nous.
- Pourquoi ?
Rien de grave. Je m'appelle
Gerald, voici Harriet.
Nous nous occuperons de vous.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Nous sommes de Torchwood.

- Qui est-ce ?
- Thomas Reginald Brockless.
Tommy.
24 ans.
Si on veut.
- Il a 24 ans ou il ne les a pas.
- Ça dépend de comment on compte.
- Quand est-il né ?
- 1894.
- Owen, tu es prêt ?
- Presque.
Tu es en robe, Tosh ?
Il semblerait bien.
Et où est-il ?
Il est là depuis 90 ans,
bien plus longtemps que nous.
Enfin, que vous.
Nous utilisons de la cryogénie
alien depuis l'époque victorienne.
Ils ont congelé Tommy en 1918.
Il a donc 24 ou 114 ans. Je
sais lequel je choisirais.
Il faut le réveiller une fois par an.
Enfin, le décongeler.
Rien qu'une journée, et
il repart dans le congélo.
- Pourquoi ?
- Vérifier qu'il est encore en état.
Un jour on aura besoin de lui.
Très bien, tout le monde est prêt ?
Allez, Tommy.
On charge à 200. On dégage !
On charge à 360. On dégage !
Gwen, vite.
Lâchez-moi,
laissez-moi...
- Tommy !
- Laissez-moi !
Tommy !
Tommy, écoute-moi !
Tommy Brockless !
C'est moi, Toshiko.
Toshiko.
Tu te souviens ?
Ça devient de plus en plus dur.
Bon crochet du gauche, en tout cas.
Tu sais où tu es ?
A Torchwood.
Tout juste.
Ça fait déjà un an ?
Bon sang.
Comment te sens-tu ?
Je tuerais pour une tasse de thé.
Ce n'est pas de la grande porcelaine.
Je suis affamé.
Allez, servez-vous. Il y a
de quoi nourrir une armée.
Jolie robe.
Merci.
Tu portes un pantalon dessous.
Il fait vraiment froid ?
C'est la mode cette année.
En 1968, c'étaient les minijupes.
C'était jour de fête pour moi.
J'attends encore leur comeback.
Je ne comprends pas. Que fait-il ici ?
Je t'ai dit, un jour
on aura besoin de lui.
Tire.
Très bien. Ça m'a l'air d'aller.
- Et maintenant, échantillons sanguins.
- ...sanguins, oui.
On te réveille une fois par an pour
te percer d'aiguilles. Pas juste.
Une fois par an pour vous,
tous les jours pour moi.
Alors, en attendant.
Tommy Reginald Brockless, né en 1894,
le 7 février, à Blackley, Manchester.
Soldat dans le 10ème
régiment du Yorkshire Ouest.
Très bien.
Fils unique de Constance
May Bassett, morte en 1900,
et de Thomas Campbell Brockless,
mort en juin 1931 à l'âge de 57 ans.
Crise cardiaque.
C'est ça, non ?
Oui. Désolée.
Ce n'est pas grave.
Il me faut juste du
temps pour m'y faire.
Je dois jeter un coup d'oeil à ta jambe.
L'hôpital de St Teilo en 1918.
Il y a eu un glissement temporel.
Une fracture dans la faille, et
deux parts de temps se chevauchent.
Une part de 1918, et ?
Une part du futur.
Mais on ignore quelle part exacte.
Ça pourrait être demain,
ou bien dans un siècle.
Que va-t-il
se passer ?
Des fragments de 1918 vont
apparaître à l'hôpital.
Quelques uns au début,
puis de plus en plus.
Le glissement fini déclenchera
une réaction en chaîne.
A moins qu'on l'arrête, les glissements
éclateront sur tout le pays,
puis le monde.
Quel rapport avec Tommy ?
Il nous aide à l'arrêter.
L'équipe de 1918 a laissé des ordres.
Documents top secrets.
A l'intention de l'officier
chargé du dossier 1918/TB.
Tommy Brockless ?
C'est coincé.
- Non, c'est fermé.
- Où est la clé ?
Verrouillage temporel basé sur les
fréquences de la faille à l'hôpital.
A l'approche du glissement, sésame,
et on saura ce que doit faire Tommy.
Pourquoi nous laisser dans l'ignorance ?
Je suppose que nous le découvrirons.
Sérieusement, vous en dites quoi ?
On dirait une star de cinéma.
Comme Charlie Chaplin ?
Allez.
Il te reste des beaux
petits mecs dans le congélo ?
Pas touche, miss. Tosh est prems.
Merci de t'occuper de
tout pendant que je sors.
T'inquiète, amuse-toi bien.
Sois prudente.
Où allez-vous ?
Boire un verre, voir un film,
peut-être manger une pizza.
Sympa.
J'ai mon portable au cas où.
- Amusez-vous bien.
- Salut !
C'est un soldat congelé de 1918.
Personne n'est parfait.
Du calme, il n'y a pas le feu.
Je n'ai qu'une journée.
Je veux tout voir !
Capitaine Scott...
Il est parti d'ici pour
naviguer jusqu'en Antarctique.
En 1910.
J'avais 16 ans, ça faisait la une.
Ça lui a pris deux ans pour y
arriver, et puis il est mort.
Alors, quoi de neuf
depuis la dernière fois ?
Des choses et d'autres.
Surtout le travail.
Quoi ?
Je savais que tu allais dire ça.
C'est ce que tu dis toujours.
Et les leçons de piano ? Tu en
avais parlé l'année dernière.
Tu allais apprendre à en jouer.
Je ne m'y suis jamais mise.
A l'espagnol non plus, je parie.
J'ai acheté un livre, par contre !
Ah, tu es pleine aux as.
Je n'ai pas eu le temps.
Tu parles de ta vie comme si tu
n'exerçais aucun contrôle dessus.
Torchwood est un job 24H/24.
24 heures par jour.
Mais tu n'es pas forcée.
C'est ta décision, non ?
Oui... sans doute.
Il est pas mal.
C'est le chef.
Toujours pareil.
Elle est pas mal non plus.
Harriet Derbyshire.
Je me demande ce qui lui est arrivé.
Elle est morte l'année après la photo.
A 26 ans.
Si jeune.
Ils l'étaient tous.
Toujours pareil.
Où tu vas ?
A l'hôpital.
Déride-toi un peu, tu veux ?
Bien joué !
C'est toujours toi qui gagnes.
Ce ne sont que des maths.
Angles et vélocité...
On vous donne le droit de vote,
l'égalité, et voilà ce qui se passe !
Alors, tu as un petit ami ?
On dirait ma mère.
Donc c'est un non.
Tu avais une petite amie ? En 1918.
Oui.
Ellie.
Ça a duré deux ans.
Que s'est-il passé ?
J'ai arrêté de la voir...
Lors de ma dernière permission.
La guerre m'avait changé.
Impossible de continuer comme avant.
Désolée.
On est bien assortis...
Bonjour ?
J'ai dit bonjour.
Vous m'entendez ?
Vous m'entendez ? Si vous...
Bonjour ?
Tout va bien ? On dirait
que vous avez vu un fantôme.
Ils démolissent l'hôpital ?
C'est ce qu'ils ont dit, oui.
Ça aurait pu causer le
glissement temporel ?
C'est possible.
Les traumatismes et la faille
ont pu le charger comme une pile.
En 1918, cet endroit était
rempli de soldats blessés.
Ça a duré quatre ans.
Passchendaele, la Somme.
Un million de soldats britanniques
sont morts durant la Grande Guerre.
C'était comme entrer en enfer.
Tu peux me croire.
J'y étais.
Owen ? Toujours rien ?
Rien du tout.
A part ce petit écart tout à l'heure.
C'est plus le domaine de Tosh.
Je l'appelle ?
Pas encore.
Garde un oeil ouvert.
Oui ?
Un demi et une vodka tonic
light avec une tranche de citron.
On dirait qu'il y a toujours
une guerre quelque part.
Ce n'est pas vraiment une guerre.
On dirait, pourtant.
La première fois qu'ils m'ont réveillé,
en 1919,
ils m'ont dit que c'était fini.
Qu'on avait gagné.
La Der des Ders, d'après eux.
Trois semaines plus tard, il y
a eu la Seconde Guerre Mondiale.
Après tout ça.
Tu ne te demandes jamais
si on mérite d'être sauvés ?
L'humanité.
Si.
Je pense qu'on le mérite.
Malgré les guerres.
Quoi ?
Quoi ?
Je me disais juste...
que je ferais tout pour toi.
Tu n'as qu'à dire : "Tommy, j'ai
besoin de mon bel héros courageux."
C'est tout ?
Quoi que ce soit, je le ferai.
Je suis sérieux.
Ça ne va pas ?
Je ne sais pas.
J'ai ressenti un truc.
Jack ?
Jack.
<i>Tic-tac, remonte l'horloge</i>
<i>Je les aime toutes...</i>
Toutes les filles y ont droit, je parie.
<i>Montrez-moi une jupe et
mon esprit s'affole...</i>
La chef ne veut pas de chansons.
Elle vous grondera si elle vous entend.
<i>J'aime leurs fossettes
et leurs boucles</i>
<i>Tic-tac, remontez l'horloge</i>
<i>Que ma journée recommence</i>
<i>Tic-tac, remontez l'horloge</i>
<i>Que ma journée recommence...</i>
<i>Jack, tu as quelque chose ?</i>
<i>J'ai un pic d'énergie ici.</i>
Oui, on a quelques fantômes.
<i>Gwen, tout va bien ?</i>
<i>Gwen ?</i>
Ça va.
Ils vous attendent.
Bonjour ?
Bonjour ?
Je vous vois.
Mais laissez-nous tranquilles !
Vous ne devriez pas être ici !
- Je ne vous veux aucun mal.
- Vous ne devriez pas être ici !
Vous ne devriez pas être ici !
Je ne vous veux aucun mal.
Je vais t'attraper !
Arrête, non !
Arrête, je t'en prie !
Je te redépose.
Quoi ?
Rien.
Merci.
Merci ?
J'étais surprise.
- Rien d'important.
- Quoi ?
Je sais, c'est ridicule...
- Mais je suis plus vieille que toi.
- Je suis né en 1894.
Tu sais ce que je veux dire.
Je suis assez vieux pour mourir au
front mais pas pour t'embrasser ?
Petite idiote.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe dans ta tête ?
Merci.
De rien.
J'ai beau être jeune,
j'en ai vu pas mal.
Que veux-tu faire à présent ?
Je pourrais te ramener chez moi,
mais on serait à l'étroit et gelés.
Tu veux venir chez moi ?
Ce n'est pas trop tôt. Tu
me connais depuis quatre ans.
Quatre jours.
D'accord.
Allons-y.
Allez, on fait la course !
Jack.
Toshiko !
On arrive.
La démolition de l'hôpital est
la cause du glissement temporel.
- On arrête la démolition.
- Trop tard, le processus a commencé.
Et la suite ?
Deux périodes différentes ne
devraient jamais co-exister.
Il faut que ce soit 1918, ou
maintenant. Pas les deux à la fois.
Donc quand 1918 se matérialisera...
Ça nous foutra vraiment en l'air.
OK.
Le temps linéaire.
Le temps "foutu en l'air".
Votre vie est une ligne droite,
de la naissance à la mort.
Essayez de dessiner cette ligne
sur la feuille sans la déplier.
C'est impossible.
Donc nous devons intervenir.
Ianto, la boîte ?
Toujours verrouillée.
Il faut qu'on estime à quand
la fin du glissement temporel.
Tosh, Owen, allez à l'hôpital,
il nous faut des relevés.
Placez-y des moniteurs.
Gwen, replonge dans les dossiers
des fois qu'on ait raté un truc.
Besoin d'aide ?
Plus que deux à installer.
Ecoute, je voulais te dire...
Fais gaffe.
Comment ça ?
Tu es très proche de Tommy.
Je l'ai rencontré, il y a quatre jours.
Oui.
Tu craques sur lui, je me trompe ?
Je peux être moi-même avec lui.
Pas besoin de faire semblant.
Oui, je comprends.
Je ne te croyais pas
fétichiste des mecs décongelés.
C'est juste que...
Ça m'embêterait que tu souffres.
S'il faut dire au revoir.
<i>Owen, tu m'entends ?</i>
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
<i>Va dans l'aile est de
l'hôpital, au deuxième étage,</i>
<i>c'était le service de radiologie.</i>
<i>Je crois qu'il s'y trouve un
indice sur le glissement temporel.</i>
<i>Je l'avais déjà lu,
mais sans comprendre.</i>
Dans le rapport de 1918,
<i>ils décrivent un détail
de ce qui s'est passé.</i>
<i>Ça dit...</i>
On entend le rugissement de moteurs
par un trou dans le mur extérieur.
Dehors, une femme en étrange armure
déchire un drapeau britannique.
<i>Peut-être est-ce une
future héroïne de l'Empire.</i>
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
<i>On ne dirait pas que c'est maintenant.</i>
<i>Le glissement a commencé, mais
s'il se finissait dans des années ?</i>
Ça y est !
C'est une pub...
Pour une assurance de voiture.
<i>Le bruit dont ils parlent,
ça doit être la circulation.</i>
Ce n'est pas dans des années...
C'est maintenant.
Des instructions ?
Pour Tommy.
Et Toshiko.
Dans 12 heures, nos périodes
cohabiteront pendant un bref moment
durant lequel Tommy sera ici et là-bas.
Il faudra qu'il soit à l'hôpital,
pour passer d'une période à l'autre.
Il sera à l'intérieur du glissement ?
Et il pourra refermer la
fracture qui en est responsable.
Et quand la fracture est refermée ?
1918 restera à sa place.
Et moi avec.
Pour de bon ?
Oui.
Tu es le seul qui puisses faire ça.
Nous t'avons amené jusqu'à maintenant
et quand tu retourneras en 1918,
ta vie sera comme un fil qui
raccommode la fabrique du temps.
Un point de couture temporel.
Comment ?
Voici un manipulateur de brèche.
C'est comme une clé.
Une fois à l'intérieur du glissement,
tu refermes la porte derrière toi.
Et c'est tout ?
Je disparais ?
Tommy, reste avec Ianto.
Tosh ? Viens avec moi.
Que lui arrive-t-il ?
Trois semaines après
son retour, Tommy meurt.
Comment ?
Peloton d'exécution.
Je ne comprends pas.
En 1918, la psychose traumatique
du soldat accablait Tommy.
C'est pour ça qu'il était à l'hôpital.
Quand Torchwood l'a pris et congelé,
ils ont gelé ses souvenirs récents.
De retour en 1918, il
redeviendra celui qu'il était.
Retour à l'état de choc.
Il sera exécuté par l'armée
britannique pour lâcheté.
Ils n'ont pas le droit !
Beaucoup de soldats en état de choc
se sont assez remis pour renquiller.
Mais une fois sur le front,
ils perdaient à nouveau pied.
Donc ils le tuent ?
Plus de 300 d'entre eux.
On ne peut pas l'y renvoyer !
- Il le faut.
- Je ne peux pas.
Bien sûr que si.
Il te fait confiance.
Pour l'envoyer à sa mort ?
Pour l'aider à sauver le futur !
Il faut que ce soit toi.
On les a archivés.
Vous les portiez quand
Torchwood vous a emmené.
Heureusement que les
mites n'y ont pas touché.
Je vais sauver le monde en pyjama.
Idiot, non ?
Ils t'ont vue avec Tommy à
l'hôpital, tu lui disais quoi faire.
Je te connais.
Tu es assez forte.
Tommy sait ce qui va lui arriver ?
Non.
S'il me demande, je dis quoi ?
Où est Toshiko ?
Toujours avec Jack.
Donc.
Demain matin.
Il est quelle heure, là ?
Neuf heures moins dix.
Et on fait quoi d'ici là ?
Vous n'en savez rien.
Tu aimerais faire quoi ?
La nuit avant une attaque,
on jouait aux cartes.
On écrivait des lettres, on
buvait, si on avait de l'alcool.
On n'a qu'à faire ça.
Oui.
Vous ne venez pas.
J'y vais seul.
On se demandait ce que
Tommy devrait faire ce soir.
Il n'a qu'à venir chez moi.
Ce n'est pas notre prisonnier,
il n'a pas à rester ici.
Si ?
Non.
Si c'est ce que vous voulez.
Demain matin, à 6h30.
Entre.
C'est très propre.
Oui.
Il n'y a que moi ici.
Et moi.
Rien que ce soir.
Et je m'en vais.
Je n'y croyais pas vraiment.
Je ne pourrai même pas t'écrire.
Tu seras si loin.
Je m'inquiétais que tu me voies vieillir.
Demain à la même heure,
il sera de retour en 1918.
Là d'où il vient.
Tu retournerais d'où tu
viens ? Si tu pouvais ?
Pourquoi, je te manquerais ?
Oui.
Je suis parti il y a longtemps.
Je ne sais plus vraiment
où est ma place.
Ça n'a peut-être plus d'importance.
Je sais que tu te sens seul.
Rentrer chez moi n'y changerait rien.
A être ici, j'ai vu des choses
dont je n'aurais jamais rêvé.
Aimé des gens que je n'aurais pas
connus si j'étais resté sur place.
Je ne changerais ça pour rien au monde.
Que t'a-t-il dit ?
Que va-t-il m'arriver ?
Ils vont te renvoyer en France.
Et ensuite ?
Mon corps sera retrouvé ?
C'est déjà ça.
C'est l'heure.
Nous ne pourrons pas être
là au moment critique.
Allez.
C'est sans danger pour l'instant.
Ça va ?
Tommy !
Où est-elle ?
En 1918.
<i>Vous devriez venir avec nous.</i>
<i>Rien de grave. Je m'appelle
Gerald, voici Harriet.</i>
<i>Nous nous occuperons de vous.</i>
Torchwood m'a emmené.
<i>Tommy !</i>
Tommy !
Restez là.
Je ne veux pas le faire.
Je ne peux pas y retourner.
- Il le faut.
- Non !
Je sais ce qui va se passer.
Ils me renverront sur le
front, dans les tranchées.
Aide-moi.
Il faut que tu y ailles.
Pourquoi moi ?
Vous êtes bien comme les généraux.
Assis en sécurité derrière les
lignes, à nous envoyer à l'assaut.
Vous pourriez tous y aller,
mais vous m'envoyez, moi !
Notre place est ici.
Je suis désolée.
L'armée et Torchwood m'ont balancé
de rôle en rôle toute ma vie.
Tout ce temps, il ne signifie rien.
- Tommy.
- Lâchez-moi.
- Tommy, debout.
- Non !
Laisse-nous seuls. S'il te plaît.
Tu as deux minutes.
Ecoute, tu es un héros.
Tu le sais ?
Tu arrêtes le glissement
temporel et sauve tout le monde.
Tu nous sauves tous.
Je ne peux pas le faire.
On a besoin de toi.
Je ne veux pas être un héros.
Je veux rester ici avec toi.
Bonsoir ?
Dis-leur.
Nous dire quoi ?
Dis-leur ce qu'il faut faire.
Tu es le seul qui puisse tout empêcher.
Sans toi, tout est fini !
Tommy !
Emmenez-moi !
Je suis dans le dortoir, en 1918.
Vous devez m'emmener pour
que je sois ici, maintenant.
Emmenez-moi, c'est tout !
Je ne serai bientôt plus là.
N'oublie pas...
La clé.
Sers-t'en.
Tu dois retourner dans ton lit.
Comme si tu n'étais jamais parti.
Puis utilise la clé.
Tommy ?
N'oublie pas.
C'est presque l'heure.
Que faites-vous ?
Vous ne devriez pas être là.
Allez !
Viens !
- Vous devriez venir avec nous.
- Pourquoi ?
Rien de grave. Je suis
Gerald, et voici Harriet.
Nous nous occuperons de vous.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Nous sommes de Torchwood.
- Où allons-nous ?
- A l'abri. Faites-moi confiance.
Avancez.
Ne vous retournez pas.
Vous devriez être au lit.
Il est encore chaud, c'est déjà ça.
Vous n'êtes pas parti longtemps.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Je ne sais pas.
Le glissement ne s'est pas arrêté.
Toshiko, montre-moi toute la ville !
Ça s'étend depuis l'hôpital.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Des fragments du passé, faisant
irruption dans le présent.
Il y en a partout.
Et la clé ?
Tommy ne s'en sert pas.
Pourquoi ?
Je ne sais pas.
Parce qu'il vient de retourner 90 ans
en arrière, qu'il est en état de choc ?
L'un de nous doit y retourner.
Jack, attends ! Tu seras coincé en 1918.
J'ai une idée.
Le glissement force la brèche à
s'ouvrir. On peut en tirer avantage.
Juste un peu suffira.
On connaît la localisation
exacte de Tommy dans le temps.
- En lui envoyant une image de toi...
- Je peux pénétrer son esprit !
En tant que projection psychique,
si on a de la chance, oui.
Et Tommy pourra te voir.
Je peux lui dire d'utiliser la clé.
Laisse-moi le faire.
Il a confiance en moi.
OK.
- J'ai combien de temps ?
- Quelques minutes.
Tu n'as qu'une seule chance, Tosh.
C'est tout.
C'est bon ?
Tommy.
Tommy.
Elle l'a trouvé.
C'est moi.
Toshiko.
Qui ?
Je suis venue t'aider.
C'est à toi ?
Non.
Tu sais ce que c'est ?
Tommy, c'est une clé.
Tu dois t'en servir.
J'ai peur.
Tout va bien.
C'est pour ça que je
suis là. Je suis un lâche.
Non, pas du tout.
Pour quoi je me bats ?
Pour le futur, pour moi.
Car tu es mon bel héros courageux.
Tommy, sers-toi de la clé.
Merci.
Au revoir.
C'est bon.
Il l'a fait.
Merci.
Il m'a fait confiance jusqu'à la fin.
Car tu as été forte.
Tout ça...
C'est grâce à toi que c'est toujours là.
Grâce à Tommy.
J'espère qu'on en vaut la peine.

Torchwood
outside the government, beyond the police
fighting for the future on behalf of the human race.
The 21st century is when everything changes...
and Torchwood is ready.
* So who can you trust to transport your goods? *
* Harwood's! *
* You won't be sorry with a Harwood's lorry! *
Good morning. Today sees an improvement on the weather we've been having recently.
Yeah, Ruth. Did you hear it?
I wrote the last bit.
What sort of accident?
Yeah, I know it.
Yeah, I'll get over there now.
Stay back, please.
You'll have to move your car.
I'm Rhys Williams, manager of Harwood's Haulage.
You can check on the vehicle later.
Bollocks! I know the driver.
Is he...?
Didn't make it. Sorry.
Can you give me some details, sir?
It's Leighton.
Er. . . Leighton Reynolds.
- Next of kin?
- Yeah, he's got a wife.
Jen.
Just had a baby, man.
- Do you know the address?
- Yeah.
54 Keppoch Street, Roath.
I give him a lift to football.
Thank you, sir.
Er, right. I'm gonna need to
arrange to move the lorry.
Not yet. There's something suspicious in the back.
It's just meat.
Leighton was taking it to the abattoir.
Yeah, well, Torchwood want to look at it first.
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com Presents</font>
Meat
Torchwood S02E04
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:evarin
Sync:Óęäě@FRS</font>
Argh, it stinks!
No bones. just dense flesh.
It's not like any flesh I've ever seen.
What is it?
Well, as there haven't been any giant cow sightings,
I suggest we take a sample back to the Hub.
We need to confiscate the contents of the van
till we've done further investigations.
Do you know where it came from?
No, but it's a Harwood's lorry so they should...
Oh, that's Rhys's firm.
- Right, done.
- Let's go.
Sorry, sir, you can't come this way now.
There's evidence of a vertebral column
but its genetic make-up isn't compatible with any known animal.
- Any idea what it is?
- I have to scan it.
But whoever's farming this meat knows it's dodgy. See this?
Official vet stamp fit for human consumption'. It's fake.
It's good, but it's fake.
Tosh, get onto the haulage firm.
Find out where the meat is from
and where it's heading.
Why did it have to be Rhys's firm?
It's too close to home.
Want to stand down?
No, to find out what's going on.
Thank you, Ianto.
* Harwood's! *
* You won't be sorry with a Harwood's lorry! *
Catchy.
Do you think the haulage firm are in on it?
Rhys? No.
He just hires the vans out.
- Driver must have seen it loaded.
- That doesn't implicate Rhys.
He's the most honest man I know.
Have you got his direct line?
Harwood's Haulage. How may I help you?
It's the police.
Hello?
Yeah, speaking.
Yes, I'm aware ofthe accident.
'It's a firm is called Harries and Harries.
They came to us two months back. It's a weekly contract.'
- 'Are they licensed?'
- 0f course they're licensed!
Could you give me their address?
There's no address here.
There's a pick-up point.
They said it was hard to find.
'Hello, sorry. All I've got is a service station on the Al?70,'
15 miles from Cardiff.
Do you have a contact number?
No, there's no contact number, either.
Can you tell me where your driver took the meat?
Yes,he was taking it to Caerwen Abattoir.
'It's a processing plant.'just general meat suppliers.
What time did the driver leave base?
'Signed out at ten to one.
Can I ask what this is about?'
I can't release that information, sir.
'Thanks for your cooperation'
Yeah, but I'm the manager...
Brilliant!
Leighton was their regular.
Apart from that first booking, they just went through him.
Yes, but now it looks like I'm hiding something.
Got him!
There he is, coming back 40 minutes later.
Let's say it takes 20 minutes to load...
We are talking a ten-mile radius.
- Jack!
- Yeah?
The scan shows it's definitely alien meat.
Where would they get it from?
If it's going into the processing plant
that means it'll be going into pies, burgers, pasties - everything.
That means people have been eating it for months.
Well, the DNA traces are stable.
There are signs of animal sedative but no diseases or residues.
My guess is it's good to eat.
Would YOU eat it?
Pizza's arrived.
I presumed it would be a late one.
- What did you get me?
- Usual. Meat Feast.
Lovely
I've narrowed it down to three potential areas.
Only one warehouse is unoccupied, just outside Merthyr.
Makes sense.Who knows what goes on there?
We have to shut the operation down,
neutralise whoever's doing this and identify the alien meat.
Tosh, you co-ordinate.
I have to slip home and check on Rhys.
Good idea. Find out how much he knows.
That's not what I meant.
Hiya
I got your message.Are you all right?
Er. ..bit of a tough day.
Had an accident at work.
One of our lorries crashed.
- Anyone hurt?
- Leighton.
One of my drivers died.
Oh, no!
Only 24.
Were you close?
For God's sake, Gwen, you met him!
Small, dark hair,played five-a-side with me.
Sorry. I can't place him.
Well, then I hear that the, er...
that the police have taken the meat out the back of the van.
You any idea why?
How would I know?
You work for them.
I don't deal in traffic accidents, so. ..
Well, they phoned the office and...
they asked loads of questions.
Thing is, all I do is hire out the lorries, so I. ..
Then there's nothing for you to worry about, is there?
Must be something dodgy going on,though.
If there was, you weren't to know, were you?
- No, of course not.
- No.
I wish I didn't have to go back to work now.
Hardly worth you coming home.
Yes, it was.
To see you.
I'm sorry.
I'll see you later.
Go and have a pint. Call Daf.
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe I will.
Like I thought.
He has no idea what's going on.
Would you care to accompany me to the slaughterhouse?
Have you ever eaten alien meat?
Yeah.
What was it like?
He seemed to enjoy it.
'Ianto,Owen, we're on our way.
'How are things looking at the slaughterhouse?
Are you in position?'
'It's all quiet.There's a deserted access road.
We won't get noticed.
I'll direct you in.'
Ianto, nearly there.
Take the second turning.
Park on the left. No-one will see the car there.
There's a main entrance at the front.
It's the only one open.
The rest are padlocked and alarmed.
How many are in there?
It's difficult to tell, there are no windows.
I have blueprints of the warehouse.
The stock has to be in the central area.
Having fun?
You don't know what you're missing.
According to the sensor, there's a heat signature across the entire building.
That's a lot of meat.
Answer the phone, Gwen!
'You two take the sides,
Gwen and I will go in the front.'
We don't want any casualties.
We stun-gun whoever's in there
and put a stop to what they're doing.
Let's go.
There's someone there.
It's Rhys.
It's Rh... What's he doing?
Did you bring the alarm de-activator?
Well, that's one way of doing it.
He must be in on it.
Don't bother running, mate.
Never. No.
Greg? We've got a bit of a problem, bruv.
How else do you explain that?
Ianto, Owen...
'Stand down. Repeat, stand down.'
He told me he didn't know what was going on.
He wouldn't lie to me.
He also said he didn't know where they were based.
But he did.
There's something wrong.
There has to be.
Gwen! No. No!
No!
Come with me.
- I just have to get him out.
- By charging in there?
What then?
You gonna knock them out?
Look, lads...
I don't mean any harm, honestly.
You can't just go in there.
You have to do as I say.
We wait until he comes out.
Boys, you should've waited for the ketamine injection
before doing that.
What about the hoses?
That's lidocaine. It's not strong enough.
If you care so much, go and work for the RSPCA.
Or don't they pay as good? Oi, you.Through here.
Shift!
I want you and one of those with me, now!
- Who sent you?
- Come on. Don't waste our time.
No-one sent me.
I came on my own.
- I'm looking for the boss.
- You're looking at him.
Ignore my little brother.
I'm, er...
I'm from Harwood's.
Harwood's Haulage.
Leighton... Er, Leighton, your driver. ..um. ..
He sort of told me what was going on, like.
Mouthy git!
He was paid to keep quiet. Ssh!
Yeah, well, he's dead.
- Lorry crashed.
- With the goods inside?
What happened to the meat?Did anyone see the meat?
No, no, no.
I. . .er. ..I picked it all up and
took it all to be incinerated.
You see, um...
I was hoping maybe I could
pick up from where he left off, boys.
How do we know you won't report us?
I'm here, aren't I?
So what exactly did he tell you?
Everything.
You know, that you were...
cleaning up old meat.
0h, it's a lot bigger than that.
What's that noise?
What is it, boys?
No idea.
But the beauty of it is,
it just keeps growing.
No matter how much we cut it.
He'll get used to it.
I don't get it.
Come on.
Let's go.
- What were you doing at that warehouse?
- You lied to me!
You were at the crash.
What are you talking about?
Stop pissing me around,Gwen!
You're so used to lying and fobbing me off
like the idiot I obviously am!
Those blokes paying you?Why you were there?
No. I'm asking the questions, all right!
I followed you, OK?
Yeah.
So that bloke, the tall bloke in the coat.
You fucking him or what?
All I ever asked was you trust me.
What?Like you trust me?
It's a two-way street, Gwen!
There's stuff you don't understand,Rhyes.
Oh, I'm just a big, dumb animal,aren't I?
I mean, what's so secret you can't even tell your own fiance? ???
Why ARE you marrying me, Gweny?
What am I, a habit you can't be arsed to break?No.
- Then tell the truth!
- No. All right!
All right. My job...
the special ops thing...
it's a lie - a cover story.
Thank you! At last!
God, what's that taken?About a year?
That's one lie down.How many more?
Is there anything in your life based on truth?
- Us.
- Us?!
Us?
Us is crumbling, Gwen!
Us is falling to shit!
You think I enjoy keeping this stuff to myself?
Then why did you?
Because I'm trying to protect you!
Have you ever stopped to think about that?No!
No. Because you prefer to blunder in without thinking or looking.
Good old ham-fisted Rhys. His heart is in the right place but
but his brain is a million miles fucking back.
Come on, let's have it all.
What exactly do I need protecting from?
I catch aliens.
- Piss off!
- You piss off...
If you won't take it seriously...
This is why I couldn't tell you.
I hunt aliens and I scavenge the stuff they leave behind.
- Sometimes I don't believe it.
- jesus Christ!
What's getting into you?
Have you been brainwashed?
Is that what's happened? Cos you are talking high-grade shit here.
Every word is the truth.
Rhys...
The things I have seen...
The times I have wanted to tell you. ..
Aliens.
In Cardiff.
Have you never seen something so mad, so. . extraordinary. ..
..that, just for one second, you think there might be more out there?
Prove it.
Well, this is unprecedented -
the fiance finding out.
Mainly because we're all sad and single.
Speak for yourself.
I am better off without all that kind of hassle.
Maybe the answer is to go out with someone who knows what you do.
Look around you, Tosh.
Only we know what we do.
I saw you here earlier.
With him -
that bloke.
He appeared out of nowhere.
It's an invisible lift.
Oh, it's too complicated to explain.
Come on. Trust me.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Who'd have thought this was here?
- That looked so real.
- It was real.
- They're extinct, Gwen.
- No, boy.
In your time line,yes.
Captain Jack Harkness.
Thanks for dropping in, Rhys.
This is the rest of the team.
Owen and Toshiko. Ianto.
Pleased to meet you.
Welcome to our headquarters.
It's a bit bigger than mine.
So, Gwen tells me you catch aliens.
That's right.
A rift through space and time runs through Cardiff
 and stuff slips in from other time lines and planets.
It's our job to monitor it.
Are you sure they're not some kind of weird cult?
You saw that alien in the warehouse.
Come on.
What did you see?
It was this huge, shapeless beast, filling the space.
Like a mound of flesh.
So it's one entity as opposed to several organisms.
The tests reveal high levels of chloride, so it probably lives in the water.
I reckon it came through the rift,into the sea and beached itself.
Like a giant alien manatee.
But how did they get it there?
That warehouse must be 50 metres long.
Maybe it was smaller when they found it. They said it's growing.
It's not dead?
No. It's breathing. Its eye opened.
So the protein chains regenerate despite the mutilation.
Not only is it replenishing its own flesh
but it's increasing it, giving them a brand-new meat supply.
It will last for years.
If we knew how it worked, we could feed the world.
We could release a single.
Before we get ahead of ourselves,
we're talking about dodgy pies in Merthyr, OK?
And the fact that they're cutting it up alive,
which we could have put a stop to if it wasn't for you.
I thought my fiancee was in danger.
Well, Mr Caveman, she wasn't.
- She can handle herself.
- Jack...
All you did was mess things up.
Now we have to think of a way to get back in and,
thanks to you, they'll have tightened security.
Well, what if you stopped and asked me what I saw in there,
instead of showing off around the place...
- Do I show off?
- Just a bit.
..you'd know I got out by saying I wanted a job as a deliveryboy.
So rather than cock things up, I've found you a way to get in.
But if you can't handle that, big boy, then you can stuff it!
- This is quite homo-erotic.
- No, no, no. jack, he is not getting us in.
Team meeting. You,too.
Jack
That's where the thing is.
That's the sedatives room.
That's where they pack the meat.
- That's good to know.
- Yeah, that is good to know.
but he's not driving us in.
They're expecting me.
You lot can hide in the back of the van.
What is this? Scooby-Doo?!
Absolutely no way is he getting involved.
When it was you to decided to get involved,
did you give me a thought?
0h, joy A domestic.
Rhys is right. He is our best way in. Stun guns only.
We've handled bigger than this.Why don't we
storm in, guns in the air, and arrest them?
Those men aren't organised criminals.
If we go in, guns blazing, they'll kill the evidence and run.
I wasn't suggesting blazing,just waving.
The last thing we need is a bloodbath.
- Point taken.
- I know that. ..
Once Rhys has loaded up, he can clear.
You don't have to come. You can stand down.
It might be better. You love him.
Makes you vulnerable.
He's not going in there without me.
- That's your decision.
- Yes, it is.
You both have to live by it.
Come on. You and me - a team!
Damn it, Rhys!
This is for real. Do you understand?
This is for real!
And if you mess up, I will kill you!
So...after we've stun-gunned the workers,
we put the creature out of its misery.
No. We're gonna save it.
Stabilise it, wait for the rift to open and. . .
send it back.
Guess who'll have to look after it in the meantime.
Tell me how are we going to use it to arm ourselves against the future?
 Hide behind it.
Why shouldn't we save it?
Because it's an alien?
It needs our protection.
You didn't hear its cry. Heart-breaking.
Listen to Ahab.
- Jack, it's growing.
- Well, we'll find a way to stop it mutating.
We are doing this. That's an order!
- Fine.
- I'll stock up on plankton.
So you do have a heart.
We see enough death.
What's that?
0h, it's just an idea of what it looks like.
I had it made up from the genetic make-up.
It looks lovely.
You're just a big softie, really, aren't you?
I'd better get on with that report.
I brought you some sandwiches.
- Thanks, Tosh.
- It's OK, just cheese and pickle.
I can keep you company.I'm not tired.
In that case, maybe you can do it.I'm knackered.
That's another big lump out of its habitat.
Makes you realise, maybe it is possible to do this job and have a relationship.
Do you fancy a game of pool sometime?
We're always in here, slaving away.
It might be nice to, I don't know, kick back and have some fun.
Yeah, why not?
- When?
- I'll check with the others.
We could have a Torchwood tournament.
Thanks for the sandwiches,Tosh.
I thought you were anti-terrorism.
That was bad enough, but knowing you're in this much danger...
Yeah, you'd feel like I do now.
Worried sick.
You don't have to do this to prove anything to me.
I'm not leaving you with all these sexy young men.
There's only one from where I'm sitting.
- Sure about this?
- Yeah.
Cos once they ring, there's no turning back.
Moring.
- You just missed the advert.
- Yeah?
just popped in for my jacket and to sign for a van.
Here's your tea. And I got you a Danish, your favourite.
I'm in the wrong job.
We have got job vacancies.
Maybe you could fit me in.
I'd be delighted to.
Would I need a licence for trucking?
Yes. Takes four weeks, and then you can go long distance.
That wouldn't be a problem.
It's them.
OK. Yeah, hello?
Why her? 0f all the women you could have chosen...
She chose us.
- Kinda stumbled upon us.
- So did I.
Doubt you'll be asking me to join.
We needed someone with police skills.
Could have chosen anyone.
Did you ever think about us?
You know, me, her parents, people who love her, who want her safe?
No, I'm sorry.We needed her.
0n her first day of work,
 she told me off for being too clinical.
She doesn't hold back, mind.
- Stubborn as hell.
- Tell me about it.
Yeah, she's an amazing girl.
I'm a lucky man, Jack.
Yeah, you said it.
I just wish you were a bit uglier.
Not gay, by any chance, are you?
Brought you a Danish, your favourite.
I know what you're like on an empty stomach.
Cheers.
- Get out as soon as you can, remember?
- Yes, yes, yes.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
Now, stop fussing, and get in the back of the van.
I'll prepare a ketamine antidote so we can start weaning it off.
Gwen, Tosh and I will take the main area.
Owen,Ianto, cover the corridors and the small rooms. You OK?
- What do you think?
- He'll be fine.
He's a good bloke.
Let's go.
Yeah.I just need your boss to sign this, mate.
 I don't want any questions asked.
You couldn't get us a cup of tea, could you?
Yes.
Where do you want my autograph?
Er...just on there, mate.
Here's a oner for your trouble.
Count it,if you like.
No, it's fine, mate. I trust you.
When you get to the abattoir, ask for Graham.
Him and the boys clean it up and process it.
 All right.
Oh, my God!
It's amazing!
How did it get here?
Imprisoned, chained and drugged.
Welcome to planet Earth.
It heard you.
It's sentient.
Oh, that's disgusting.
What have they done to you?
What have they done to you, my poor friend?
Everyone...they're armed.
Rhys.
Gwen.
Stay here.
Where have you been? That injection was due ten minutes ago.
I needed more ketamine. I've had to up the dose.
The thing's in agony.
It's meat. It can't feel anything.
You going soft, or what?
Get inside and play nurse, if you're so bothered.
We've got work to do.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on.
There's only 12 bags in here.
He's supposed to have three more.
Come on, hurry up!
Hello. I have a...thingy here somewhere...Hell of a day.
I should be getting off, mate.
I've got jobs backing up, you see?
Well, they'll have to wait.
Dale,we've got a problem.There are people in the building.
You want to answer me?!
- Ianto, did Rhys get away?
- I'll check now.
Hey, hey, hey!
You looking for someone? How many more of you?!
Just us.
You thought the two of you could take us out?
Nah, you're not that stupid.
Dave, get some ropes, tie their hands.
I want every door locked, inside and out.
Nobody leaves the building till this is sorted.
- Move it!
- They've got Rhys and Ianto.
Gwen!
Gwen. Listen. Hey! It will be OK.
- Locked.
- They must know we're here.
This way.
What is it?
The lads call it the Cash Cow.
Dale, what are you doing?
They couldn't bear to see us making money.
Fancied some for yourselves, eh?
Thought we'd be a pushover?
Mate, you're so out of your depth.
Funny, I was just thinking the same about you.
Dale, don't be an idiot!
Show yourselves or I shoot the delivery boy!
OK!
There's no need to make any threats.
Just the two of you, is it?
Gun down.Kick it over.
- I don't have a gun.
- He had one, so you must have!
OK!OK.
Any more of you?
And before you answer, have a proper think,
cos if you lie, I will shoot you.
It's just me.
Get against the drum.
We can help you, Dale.
Yeah, help yourselves, more like.
Stand next to her. You, too!
Dale! Two more. Far corner.
They can't get out. It's locked.
Kick out your weapons, stand where I can see you!
Drop your weapons.
Do you know what you've got here, Dale?
- Shut up now!
- It's an alien.
A creature from another galaxy.
It came through a rift in time and space,
and it was unlucky enough to find you.
No. No way.
Did you really think it originated on this planet?
Have you ever seen anything like it before?
It can't be. Can it?
Look at it.
Look at it.
- It's just meat, that's all.
- You're carving up a sentient creature,
- and you've got to stop!
- And then what have I got?
I'm making money here! This is my business.
For the first time in my life, I've actually got something for myself!
Dale, stop. You can still walk away from this.
No.
You lied to me.
No!
No!
Die!
Shit!
Ianto! Go! After them!
Owen! Rhys has been shot!
The creature's coming loose.
We need that sedative now!
Open your eyes. Come on.You can do this.
Open your eyes now.OK?
Yeah, I'm on it, I'm on it.
Owen, we need you!
The creature's breaking free. If we try and get past, we'll be crushed.
Come on.
It wasn't me!
I never wanted to be a part of this!
Sedatives won't work now.
If it's got loose, you're never gonna stop it!
We've gotta help them.
It's out of control.
Change of plan.
You went and shot him, bruv.
Come on! Go, go! Fill the other one.
I'm going as fast as I can.
Pray they survive.
Bloody hell!
I'm sorry.
He's OK.
Owen, you're making it worse!
Open your eyes!
You can do it.Come on.
It's working.Yeah, it's working.
What did you do?
Mercy killing.
Rhys, Rhys, listen to me, listen to me.
That's it, you're with me, OK?
I've got you tight.
Keep your eyes nice and open.
Gwen, let me look at him.
OK.
Soft, soft, soft.
OK.
I'm going to rip this.
I want you to keep the pressure on, OK?
OK.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Here he is.
Hero of the hour.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Are you all right?
???
Sorry.
Next time, let her take the bullet.
Never.
What happened to the blokes?
We gave them amnesia pills.
They'll remember who they are but not what they did over the past few months.
So they got away with it?
It would never stand up in court of law.
And the creature?
Incinerated.
So there's nothing left.
It was never there.
Gwen, I need a word.
Sure.
Rhys has to forget too, you know?
At least let me give it to him at home.
Let's not go home just yet.
Rhys, you've just been shot.
I know.
Come on,
Let's go for an ice cream.
Look around us.
Nobody else knows what we've been through.
Or what else is out there.
The sky won't be the same to me any more.
I used to look up and think,
'Ah, looks like rain, man.'
But now,
oh, now I'll...
I'll look and I'll think of all the other worlds and the planets
 and stuff spinning around out there.
And I got to be a part of it all!
Fantastic!
Which puts worrying about unsigned dockets into perspective, I can tell you.
You've got some ice cream on your chin.
Have I? Gone?
I want to know about all of it,
about every alien you've ever seen.
You could take photos.
I'll keep a scrap book.
Wouldn't show no-one, no way.
No,because you won't be keeping one.
And you know...
I'm even cool about Jack.
All right, he's handsome, enigmatic,saves the world and all that.
But it's me you come home to at the end of it all.
And I always will.
Hey. Daf! All right?
0h, nothing much.
Same old, same old.
Yeah!
What?
No way!
I'm not doing it.
- I won't drug him.
- You have to.
You can't allow him to remember.
It's the rules. But none of you have any partners outside of this.
But we understand how you feel.
No, you don't.
No, you don't, Jack!
You all think it's cold and lonely out there.
But it isn't for me because I have him. He matters.
And I've lied to him for long enough.
What he did today was so brave,
braver than any of us
because we signed up for this. But he didn't!
He did it because he loves me,
and I won't take that away from him!
I won't!
And if that means I have to quit
or you retcon me or whatever, then fine,
fine.
You really think you could go back to your old life before Torchwood?
I wouldn't know anything different.
I would.
Give Rhys my love, and I will see you tomorrow.
If he comes after me again,
I'll kill him.
I love me.
Oh god. Say something.
- You OK with that?
- I've been for the last three years.
I killed three girls.
And it felt so good.
- Would you die for me?
- Yes.
How did you come here?
I'm the one you can confide it, remember?
I bury the memory of 150 years ago.
- Great.
- My little brother.
I can't afford to remember.
Drop the gun Jack.
And you always remember what you killed.
- Don't you, Jack?
- I let go of his hand.
It was the worst day of my life.

Torchwood
Au delà du gouvernement
et de la police.
Ils se battent pour
le futur de l'humanité.
C'est au 21ème siècle
que tout bascule.
Et Torchwood est prêt.
<i>Harwood !</i>
<i>Jamais de remords avec
Harwood Transport !</i>
<i>Bonjour, amélioration
du temps aujourd'hui...</i>
Ouais, Ruth. Tu l'as entendu ?
C'est moi qui ai écrit la fin.
Quel genre d'accident ?
Oui, je connais.
J'arrive tout de suite.
Restez-là, s'il vous plaît.
Vous devez circuler.
Je suis Rhys Williams,
manager de Harwood Transport.
Vous pourrez vérifier
le véhicule plus tard.
Je m'en fiche ! Je connais
le chauffeur, il est... ?
Il n'a pas survécu. Désolé.
- Que savez-vous de lui ?
- C'est Leighton.
Leighton Reynolds.
- Quelqu'un à contacter ?
- Oui, sa femme.
Jen. Ils viennent d'avoir un bébé.
- Leur adresse ?
- 54 Keppoch Street, Roath.
- On allait au foot ensemble.
- Merci, monsieur.
Je vais devoir faire évacuer le camion.
Pas encore.
La marchandise est louche.
Ce n'est que de la viande !
Leighton l'amenait à l'abattoir.
Torchwood veut d'abord y jeter un oeil.

Ça pue !
Pas d'os. Que de la chair.
Je n'en ai jamais vu de telle.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Aucune vache géante n'a été
aperçue dernièrement...
On devrait donc ramener
un échantillon au QG.
On doit confisquer la marchandise
pour des recherches plus poussées.
- On sait d'où ça venait ?
- Non, mais c'est un camion Harwood.
C'est l'entreprise de Rhys.
- C'est bon.
- On y va.
Désolé monsieur, la route est
bloquée pour le moment.
Il y a bien une colonne vertébrale,
mais son patrimoine génétique
ne correspond à aucun animal.
<i>- Une idée de ce que c'est ?
- Aucune.</i>
Mais quiconque s'en occupe sait
que c'est louche. Tu vois ça ?
Tampon officiel du véto. "Propre à la
consommation humaine". C'est un faux.
Bien fait, mais faux.
Tosh, occupe toi de l'entreprise.
Vois d'où vient cette viande.
Pourquoi la boite de Rhys ?
C'est trop personnel.
Tu veux te mettre en repos ?
Non, je veux savoir ce qu'il se passe !
Merci, Ianto.
<i>Harwood !</i>
<i>Jamais de remords avec
Harwood Transport !</i>
Sympa.
- Tu penses qu'ils sont au courant ?
- Rhys ? non.
Il ne sait rien de la marchandise.
Il s'occupe juste des camions.
- Le chauffeur a bien dû la voir.
- Ça n'implique pas Rhys.
C'est l'homme le plus honnête
que je connaisse.
Tu as sa ligne directe ?
Harwood Transport.
En quoi puis-je vous aider ?
C'est la police.
Allô ?
Oui, en personne.
Oui, je suis au courant pour l'accident.
<i>Une société appelée Harries and Harries.</i>
<i>Ils nous ont contactés il y a 2 mois.
Contrat hebdomadaire.</i>
<i>- Ils ont une licence ?
- Bien sûr !</i>
Vous avez leur adresse ?
- Il n'y a pas d'adresse !
- Il y a un point relais.
Ils disaient que c'était dur à trouver.
Allô. Désolé, je n'ai qu'une
station service sur la A470.
A 30 km de Cardiff.
Vous avez un numéro ?
Non, il n'y en a pas non plus.
Savez-vous où votre chauffeur
amenait la viande ?
<i>Oui, à l'abattoir Caerwen.</i>
<i>Une usine de traitement,
des fournisseurs de viande.</i>
A quelle heure le
chauffeur est-il parti ?
<i>Il a pointé à 12h50.
Pouvez-vous me dire de quoi il s'agit ?</i>
Je ne peux vous dévoiler cette
information, monsieur. Merci.
Je suis le patron...
Super !
Leighton était leur habitué.
A part la première fois, ils
passaient toujours par lui.
Oui, mais maintenant on dirait
que je cache quelque chose.
On l'a !
Le voilà, 40 minutes plus tard.
Disons qu'il a chargé
pendant 20 minutes...
Ca fait environ 16 km de rayon.
- Jack !
- Oui ?
Il s'agit bien de
viande extra-terrestre.
Ils l'auraient eu où, bon sang ?
Après traitement ça donne
des pâtés, des burgers...
Donc les gens en mangent
depuis des mois.
L'ADN est stable.
Des signes de sédatifs mais
aucune maladie ou résidus.
- Je pense que c'est bon.
- Tu en mangerais ?
Pizza ! Je me doutais
qu'on finirait tard.
- Tu m'as pris quoi ?
- Comme d'hab. Spéciale viande.
Génial.
Je l'ai réduit à 3 zones possibles.
Un seul entrepôt est
inoccupé, juste après Merthyr.
- Ca colle. Qui sait ce qu'il s'y passe ?
- On doit arrêter cette opération,
neutraliser ceux qui la dirigent
et identifier cette viande.
Tosh, tu coordonneras.
- Je vais rentrer et m'occuper de Rhys.
- Bonne idée.
- Essaye d'apprendre ce qu'il sait.
- C'est pas ce que je voulais dire.
J'ai eu ton message. Ca va ?
Dure journée... Un accident au boulot.
Un camion s'est renversé.
- Des blessés ?
- Leighton.
- Il est mort.
- Oh, non !
- 24 ans.
- Vous étiez proches ?
Bon sang, Gwen, tu l'as déjà vu !
Petit, brun, il jouait au foot avec moi.
Désolée, je m'en souviens plus.
Bref, j'ai entendu...
Que la police avait pris la viande.
Tu sais pourquoi ?
Comment je le saurais ?
Tu y travailles.
Je m'occupe pas des
accidents de la route...
Ils ont appelé au bureau et...
ils ont posé beaucoup de questions.
Je ne fais que louer
les camions, donc...
Pas de quoi s'inquiéter, alors.
- Quelque chose doit être louche.
- Si c'était le cas, tu ne saurais rien.
Non, bien sûr que non.
J'aimerais ne pas devoir
retourner travailler.
Ca valait pas la peine de rentrer.
Si. Pour te voir.
Désolée.
On se voit plus tard.
Sors prendre un verre. Appelle Daf.
Oui.
Peut-être, oui.
Je m'en doutais. Il ne
sait pas ce qui se passe.
Voudriez-vous
m'accompagner à l'abattoir ?
- Tu as déjà mangé de la viande alien ?
- Oui.
- C'était comment ?
- Il avait l'air d'aimer ça.
<i>Ianto, Owen, on est en route.</i>
<i>Comment ça se passe à l'abattoir ?</i>
<i>Pas un bruit. Il y a un
accès désert. Je t'indiquerai.</i>
<i>Ianto, on y est presque.</i>
<i>Prends la deuxième. Gare-toi à
gauche. On verra pas la voiture.</i>
L'entrée principale est devant.
C'est la seule d'ouverte.
Les autres sont sécurisées.
Ils sont combien ?
Difficile à dire, il
n'y a pas de fenêtres.
J'ai un plan de l'entrepôt.
La viande se situe dans la
zone centrale. On s'amuse ?
Tu ne sais pas ce que tu loupes.
D'après les capteurs, il y a une
signature thermique sur tout l'entrepôt.
Ca fait beaucoup de viande.
Réponds, Gwen !
<i>Vous deux, sur les côtés. Gwen
et moi, on passera par devant.</i>
Je ne veux pas de blessés.
On assomme les individus
et on arrête leur opération.
C'est parti.
DANGER - ZONE INTERDITE
Il y a quelqu'un.
C'est Rhys.
Qu'est-ce qu'il fait ?
Tu as pris le désactivateur ?
C'est un autre moyen.
Il doit en faire partie.
N'essaye pas de t'enfuir, mec.
Jamais. Non.
Greg ? On a un problème ici.
Et tu expliques ça comment ?
Ianto, Owen.
<i>Abandon. Je répète, abandon.</i>
Il m'a dit ne pas savoir ce qui
se passe. Il ne me mentirait pas.
Comme il ne savait pas où
ils étaient. Pourtant si.
Quelque chose ne va
pas. C'est pas possible.
Gwen ! Non !
Non !
Viens avec moi.
- Je dois le faire sortir de là.
- En courant droit dedans ?
Et ensuite ? Tu vas les assommer ?
Ecoutez les gars...
Je ne vous veux aucun mal, vraiment.
Tu ne peux pas y aller.
Tu dois faire ce que je te dis.
On attend qu'il sorte.
Vous auriez dû attendre l'injection
de Kétamine avant de faire ça.
- Et les tuyaux ?
- C'est de la lidocaïne. Trop faible.
Si t'aimes tant ça, va
travailler pour la SPA.
- Ca ne paye pas assez ?
- Toi. Par ici.
Bouge !
Toi et un de ces trucs, avec moi !
- Qui t'envoie ?
- Allez. Nous fais pas perdre de temps.
Personne.
Je suis venu de moi
même. Je cherche le chef.
- Tu le regardes.
- Ignore mon petit frère.
Je...
Je suis d'Harwood.
Harwood Transport.
Leighton... Votre conducteur...
Il m'a en quelque sorte
dit ce qu'il se passait.
Quel abruti ! Il était payé pour la fermer.
Ouais, il est mort.
- Le camion s'est renversé.
- Avec la marchandise ?
- Quelqu'un a vu la viande ?
- Non, non.
J'ai tout fait incinérer.
Peut-être que je pourrais
reprendre là où il s'est arrêté.
Comment on sait que tu
nous dénonceras pas ?
Je suis là, non ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il t'a dit exactement ?
Tout.
Que vous ramassez de la vieille viande.
C'est un peu plus que ça.
C'est quoi ce bruit ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Aucune idée.
Mais le meilleur, c'est
que ça continue de grossir.
Peu importe combien on en coupe.
Il s'habituera.
Je ne comprends pas.
Allez. On y va.
- Tu faisais quoi à cet entrepôt ?
- Tu m'as menti, tu étais à l'accident !
- De quoi tu parles ?
- Arrête de m'énerver, Gwen !
Tu me mets toujours de côté
comme un vulgaire idiot !
Ces gars t'ont payé ?
Pourquoi tu fais ça ?
Je pose les questions !
Je t'ai suivie.
Le grand mec avec le
manteau. Tu baises avec ?
J'ai toujours voulu que
tu me fasses confiance.
Comme toi ? Ca doit
marcher dans les deux sens !
Tu ne peux pas comprendre.
Je suis juste une
grosse bête débile, hein?
Qu'est-ce que tu ne peux
même pas dire à ton fiancé ?
Pourquoi tu veux m'épouser ?
Je suis quoi, une habitude
que t'es pas foutue de rompre ?
- Non.
- Dis la vérité !
D'accord ! Mon boulot...
Les opérations spéciales...
C'est un mensonge. Une couverture.
Merci ! Enfin !
Ca a pris quoi, un an ?
Un de moins. Encore combien ?
Il y a quelque chose
dans ta vie qui est vrai ?
- Nous.
- Nous ?
On se perd, Gwen !
C'est de la connerie !
Tu crois que ça m'amuse de
garder tout ça pour moi ?
- Alors pourquoi ?
- Parce que je veux te protéger !
T'as déjà pensé à ça, au moins ? Non !
Tu préfères réfléchir après.
Rhys le bon vieux maladroit.
Son coeur est bien là mais son cerveau
est à des millions de kilomètres.
Allez, crache le morceau !
Pourquoi j'ai besoin de protection ?
J'attrape des extra-terrestres.
- Va te faire voir !
- Non, toi.
- Si tu peux pas être sérieuse...
- C'est pour ça que je t'ai rien dit.
Je poursuis des extra-terrestres et
je nettoie ce qu'ils laissent derrière.
Parfois j'y crois même pas.
Qu'est-ce qu'il t'est arrivé ?
T'as eu un lavage de cerveau ?
C'est ça ? Car tu racontes
un ramassis de conneries, là.
Tout est la vérité.
Rhys.
Les choses que j'ai vues...
Toutes les fois où j'ai
voulu t'en parler...
Des extra-terrestres.
A Cardiff.
T'as déjà vu quelque
chose de tellement fou,
de tellement extraordinaire...
que pendant une seconde, tu penses
qu'il pourrait y avoir plus que ça.
Prouve-le.
C'est une première. Le
fiancé qui découvre tout.
Surtout parce qu'on est
tous tristes et seuls.
Parle pour toi.
Je suis bien mieux sans tout ça.
Peut-être qu'il faudrait sortir
avec quelqu'un qui sait ce qu'on fait.
Regarde autour de toi,
Tosh. Il n'y a que nous.
Je t'ai vu ici. Avec ce mec.
Il est apparu de nulle part.
C'est un ascenseur invisible.
Trop compliqué à expliquer.
Allez. Fais-moi confiance.
- Prêt ?
- Oui.
Qui l'aurait cru ?
- On aurait dit un vrai.
- C'en est un.
Ils sont éteints, Gwen.
Dans votre monde, oui.
Capitaine Jack Harkness.
Merci de passer, Rhys.
Voilà le reste de l'équipe.
Owen et Toshiko. Ianto.
Enchanté.
Bienvenue à notre QG.
Un peu plus grand que le mien.
- Gwen m'a dit pour les aliens.
- C'est vrai.
Une brèche à travers le temps
et l'espace traverse Cardiff.
Certains arrivent ici d'autres mondes,
c'est notre boulot de gérer ça.
Tu es sûre que c'est pas une secte ?
Tu as vu cet extra-terrestre
dans l'entrepôt. Allez.
Qu'avez-vous vu ?
C'était cette grosse bête sans
forme, qui remplissait l'espace.
Une pile de chair.
Donc c'est une seule entité.
Pas plusieurs organismes.
Les tests ont révélé un taux élevé de
chlorure. Ca vit sûrement dans l'eau.
Ca a dû glisser de la
brèche dans la mer puis s'échouer.
Comme un grand lamatin extra-terrestre.
Comment ils l'auraient transporté ?
L'entrepôt fait 50 mètres de long.
C'était peut-être petit quand ils l'ont
trouvé. Ils ont dit que ça grossissait.
- Il n'est pas mort ?
- Non.
Il respire, ses yeux sont ouverts.
Les chaînes de protéine se
régénèrent malgré la mutilation.
Il régénère sa propre chair,
tout en l'augmentant, leur
fournissant encore plus de viande.
Ca peut durer des années.
En comprenant comment ça marche,
on pourrait nourrir la planète.
On pourrait sortir un single !
Ne vous emballez pas. On se
concentre sur cette affaire à Merthyr,
et sur le fait qu'ils le coupent à vif,
chose qu'on aurait déjà pu
arrêter sans votre présence.
- Je pensais Gwen en danger.
- Elle ne l'était pas, M. Cromagnon.
- Elle sait se débrouiller.
- Jack...
Vous n'avez fait qu'empirer les choses.
On doit trouver comment y entrer, avec
grâce à vous une sécurité renforcée.
Si vous m'aviez demandé ce qui s'est
passé, au lieu de frimer avec votre QG...
- Je frime ?
- Un peu.
...vous sauriez que j'ai
obtenu un job de livreur.
Plutôt qu'empirer les choses,
je vous ai trouvé une porte d'entrée.
Si tu supportes pas ça, mon
grand, tu peux te le mettre !
- C'est assez homo-érotique.
- Non, il ne nous fait pas rentrer.
Réunion générale. Vous aussi.
Jack...
C'est là que se trouve la chose.
Voilà la salle avec les sédatifs.
Et là où ils emballent la viande.
- C'est bon à savoir.
- Oui, mais il ne nous fait pas rentrer.
Ils m'attendent. Vous pourrez
rester à l'arrière du camion.
C'est quoi ça, Scooby Doo ?
Il ne vient pas avec nous.
Quand tu t'es engagée là dedans,
tu m'as demandé mon avis ?
- Les joies de la vie en couple.
- Rhys a raison.
C'est notre meilleure option.
Pistolets paralysants seulement.
Pourquoi ne pas arriver flingues
à la main pour les arrêter.
Ce ne sont pas des criminels organisés.
Si on arrive, arme au poing, ils
tueront la preuve avant de s'enfuir.
Je disais pas arme au poing,
juste chargée.
On ne veut surtout
pas d'un bain de sang.
Bon point.
Une fois le camion
chargé, Rhys pourra partir.
Tu n'es pas obligée de venir.
Ca serait peut-être mieux.
Tu l'aimes.
Ca te rend vulnérable.
Il ne va pas là-bas sans moi.
- C'est ton choix.
- Oui.
Vous devrez tous les deux vivre avec.
Allez. Toi et moi, une équipe !
Bon sang, Rhys !
C'est pour de vrai, tu comprends ?
Et si tu foires, je te tuerai !
Après avoir paralysé les employés, on
abrège les souffrances de la créature.
Non.
On va la sauver.
On va la stabiliser, attendre que la
brèche s'ouvre, et la renvoyer chez elle.
On se demande qui va
devoir s'en occuper...
En quoi elle nous permettra
de nous armer contre le futur ?
- En se cachant derrière.
- Pourquoi ne pas la sauver ?
Parce que c'est un alien ?
Elle a besoin de nous.
Vous ne l'avez pas entendu pleurer.
- A fendre le coeur.
- Ecoutez-moi Ahab.
- Jack, elle grandit.
- On trouvera un moyen d'arrêter ça.
Nous allons la sauver. C'est un ordre !
- D'accord.
- Je vais faire le plein de plancton.
Alors tu as bien un coeur.
On voit assez de morts comme ça.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Une idée de ce à quoi ça ressemble.
Je l'ai créé à partir de
son patrimoine génétique.
Ca a l'air charmant.
Tu as le coeur tendre, finalement.
Je ferais mieux de commencer ce rapport.
- Je t'ai amené des sandwichs.
- Merci, Tosh.
Fromage et cornichon.
Je peux te tenir compagnie.
Je ne suis pas fatiguée.
Dans ce cas, tu peux peut-être
le faire. Je suis crevé.
Voilà un autre dadais
hors de son habitat.
Ca fait réfléchir.
C'est peut-être possible d'avoir
ce travail, et une relation.
Un billard te tenterait, un jour ?
On est toujours ici, à trimer.
Ca serait sympa de
sortir un peu s'amuser.
Pourquoi pas ?
- Quand ça ?
- Je verrai avec les autres.
On pourrait se faire
un tournoi Torchwood.
Merci pour les sandwichs, Tosh.
Je pensais que t'étais
dans l'anti-terrorisme.
C'était déjà affreux, mais
te savoir autant en danger...
Tu serais comme moi maintenant.
Morte d'inquiétude.
Tu n'as rien à me prouver.
Je ne te laisse pas avec
tous ces jeunes hommes sexy.
Je n'en vois qu'un seul.
- Vous êtes sûr ?
- Oui.
Car il n'y aura pas
de demi-tour possible.
Bonjour.
- La pub vient juste de passer.
- Ah ?
Je passe juste prendre ma
veste et sortir un camion.
Voilà votre thé.
Et un Danish, votre préféré.
J'ai choisi le mauvais boulot.
- Nous avons des offres.
- Vous pourriez me faire entrer.
- J'en serais ravie.
- Il me faudrait un permis camion ?
Oui. Ca prend 4 semaines, puis
vous pouvez faire de longs trajets.
Ca ne serait pas un problème.
C'est eux.
Allô ?
Pourquoi elle ? Vous auriez
pu choisir n'importe qui.
Elle nous a choisis.
- Elle est tombée sur nous.
- Tout comme moi.
Mais vous n'allez pas me recruter.
Il nous fallait quelqu'un
aux compétences policières.
Il n'y a pas qu'elle. Vous
n'avez jamais pensé à nous ?
Moi, ses parents, les gens qui
l'aiment et la veulent en sécurité ?
Non, désolé. On avait besoin d'elle.
Son premier jour, elle m'a
reproché d'être trop clinique.
Toujours à dire ce qu'elle pense.
- Têtue comme une mule.
- M'en parlez pas.
C'est une fille fantastique.
J'ai de la chance, Jack.
Oui.
J'aurais juste aimé que vous
soyiez un peu plus moche.
Vous seriez pas gay, par hasard ?
Je t'ai pris un Danish, ton préféré.
Je te connais quand
tu as le ventre vide.
Merci.
- Pars dès que possible, d'accord ?
- Oui.
- Je t'aime.
- Moi aussi.
Arrête de faire des histoires
et monte à l'arrière.
Je préparerai un antidote à la
kétamine pour commencer le sevrage.
Gwen, Tosh et moi prenons
la salle principale.
Owen, Ianto, prenez les
couloirs et les petites salles.
- Ca va ?
- A ton avis ?
Ca ira. C'est un bon gars.
Allons-y.
Il me faut une signature de ton patron.
Je ne veux pas qu'on
me pose de questions.
- Vous n'auriez pas du thé, par hasard ?
- Je reviens.
Où est-ce que je signe ?
Juste là.
En voilà 100.
- Tu peux compter.
- C'est bon mec, je te crois.
Une fois à l'abattoir, demande Graham.
- C'est lui qui s'occupe du traitement.
- D'accord.
Oh, mon dieu !
C'est énorme !
Comment est-ce arrivé là ?
Séquestré, enchaîné et drogué.
Bienvenue sur la planète Terre.
Il t'a entendu. Il est doué de sensation.
Jack...
C'est dégoûtant.
Que t'ont-ils fait ?
Que t'ont-ils fait, mon pauvre ami ?
Tout le monde... Ils sont armés.
Rhys.
Gwen. Reste là.
Où t'étais ?
L'injection était
prévue il y a 10 minutes.
Il me fallait plus de kétamine.
J'ai dû augmenter la dose, il agonise.
C'est de la viande. Ca ne sent rien.
Tu t'attendris ou quoi ?
Va jouer l'infirmière, si ça te touche.
On a du boulot.
Attendez.
Il n'y a que 12 sacs. Il en manque 3.
Allez, on se dépêche !
Bonjour. J'ai un...
truc, là. Sacrée journée.
Je devrais y aller.
J'ai d'autres livraisons.
Ca devra attendre.
Dale, il y a des gens à l'intérieur.
Tu veux jouer avec moi ?
- Ianto, Rhys est parti ?
- Je vais vérifier.
Tu cherches quelqu'un ?
Combien vous êtes ?
Juste nous.
Vous pensiez nous avoir à deux ?
Vous êtes pas si bêtes.
Dave, attache-les.
Fermez toutes les portes.
Personne ne sort tant que
c'est pas réglé. Du nerf !
Ils ont Rhys et Ianto.
Gwen, écoute.
Ca va aller.
- Fermé.
- Ils savent qu'on est là.
Jack, par ici.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Ils appellent ça la vache à fric.
Dale, qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Ils ont pas supporté
qu'on se fasse de l'argent.
Vous en vouliez aussi ? Vous pensiez
que ça serait une partie de plaisir ?
Mec, t'es à côté de la plaque.
Je pensais justement
la même chose de toi.
- Dale, fais pas le con !
- Montrez-vous ou je tue le livreur !
Pas besoin de faire des menaces.
Juste vous deux, c'est ça ?
- Arme à terre.
- J'en ai pas.
- Il en avait une, tu dois en avoir !
- OK !
Vous êtes encore combien ?
Réfléchis bien avant de répondre.
Si tu mens, je te tire dessus.
Il n'y a que moi.
- Contre les tonneaux !
- On peut vous aider, Dale.
Vous allez plutôt vous servir.
A côté d'elle. Toi aussi !
Il y en a deux autres,
dans le coin au fond !
Ils ne peuvent pas sortir, c'est fermé.
Jetez vos armes.
- Tu sais ce que c'est, Dale ?
- Ferme-la !
C'est un extra-terrestre.
Une créature venant d'une autre galaxie.
Passée par une brèche temporelle,
et elle a eu la malchance de te trouver.
Non, impossible.
Tu crois vraiment que ça vient d'ici ?
Tu as déjà vu quelque chose comme ça ?
- C'est impossible. Non ?
- Regarde-la.
Regarde-la.
C'est que de la viande, c'est tout.
Vous découpez une créature
vivante, et vous devez arrêter !
Et qu'est-ce qu'il me restera ?
Je me fais de l'argent,
c'est mon affaire !
Pour la première fois, j'ai
vraiment quelque chose pour moi !
Dale, arrêtez. Vous
pouvez encore arrêter ça.
Non.
- Vous m'avez menti !
- Non !
Non !
Meurs !
Merde !
Ianto ! Poursuis-les !
Owen, Rhys a reçu une balle !
La créature se détache,
il nous faut ce sédatif !
Ouvre les yeux. Tu peux le faire.
Oui, je m'en occupe.
Owen, on a besoin de toi !
La créature se détache. Si on
essaye de passer, on sera écrasés.
C'était pas moi ! J'ai jamais
voulu tremper là dedans !
Les sédatifs ne marcheront plus.
Si elle a commencé, vous
ne l'arrêterez jamais !
On doit les aider.
Elle est incontrôlable.
Changement de plan.
Tu lui as tiré dessus.
Allez ! Vas-y, remplis l'autre !
Je vais aussi vite que possible.
Prie pour qu'ils survivent.
Bon sang !
Je suis désolé.
Il va bien.
Owen, ça empire !
Ouvre les yeux !
Tu peux le faire, allez !
Ca marche. Oui, ça marche.
Qu'est-ce que tu as fait ?
Je l'ai euthanasiée.
Rhys, écoute-moi.
C'est bon, t'es avec moi. Je te tiens.
Garde les yeux ouverts.
Gwen, laisse-moi voir.
Doucement.
Je vais déchirer ça. Continue
à appuyer dessus, d'accord ?
Je suis vraiment désolé.
Je suis vraiment désolé.
Le voilà.
Le héros du jour.
- Salut.
- Salut.
Ca va ?
Maintenant, oui.
Désolée.
La prochaine fois, laisse
la prendre la balle.
Hors de question.
Qu'est-il arrivé aux mecs ?
On leur a donné des pillules d'amnésie.
Ils se rappelleront qui ils sont mais
pas ce qu'ils ont fait ces derniers mois.
- Donc ils s'en sortent sans rien ?
- Ca ne tiendrait jamais en justice.
Et la créature ?
Incinérée.
Il ne reste plus rien.
- Elle n'a jamais été là.
- Gwen, je dois te parler.
Rhys doit oublier aussi, tu sais.
Laisse-moi au moins
lui donner à la maison.
Ne rentrons pas tout de suite.
- Rhys, tu t'es fait tirer dessus.
- Je sais.
Allons manger une glace.
Regarde autour de nous.
Personne ne sait ce qu'on a vécu.
Ou tout ce qui existe.
Le ciel ne sera plus jamais le même.
Je le regardais souvent en
me disant "Ca sent la pluie."
Maintenant...
Je penserai à tous les mondes
et planètes qui tournent là haut.
Et j'ai pu en faire partie !
Fantastique !
Ca me fait relativiser à
propos des registres non signés.
- T'as de la glace sur le menton.
- C'est bon ?
Je veux tout savoir sur chaque
extra-terrestre que tu as vu.
Tu pourrais prendre des
photos. Je tiendrais un album.
- Je le montrerais à personne, évidemment.
- Non, car on n'en aura pas.
Et tu sais...
Je suis même OK à propos de Jack.
D'accord, il est superbe, mystérieux,
il sauve le monde et tout ça...
Mais c'est moi que tu
rejoins quand tout est fini.
Et ça sera toujours le cas.
Daf, ça va ?
Pas grand chose.
La routine.
Quoi ? C'est pas vrai !
- Je peux pas le droguer.
- Tu dois le faire.
Il ne peut pas se souvenir de tout ça.
- Ce sont les règles.
- Aucun de vous n'a de partenaire extérieur.
- Mais on comprend ce que tu ressens.
- Non.
Non, Jack !
Vous pensez tous que le monde
extérieur est froid et solitaire.
Mais pas pour moi, car je l'ai, lui.
Il compte.
Et je lui ai menti assez longtemps.
Ce qu'il a fait aujourd'hui
était si courageux...
Bien plus que nous, car on
a choisi de faire ça. Mais pas lui !
Il l'a fait car il m'aime, et
je ne veux pas lui enlever ça !
C'est hors de question.
Et si ça veut dire que
je dois démissionner,
ou que vous m'effacerez, tant pis.
Tu crois vraiment que tu pourrais
retourner à ton ancienne vie ?
- Je ne verrais aucune différence.
- Moi si.
Passe le bonjour à Rhys,
et je te vois demain.

0h,I'll take that as a 'yes',then.
Having you to come home

Class D artefacts.

- Sure.
Owen,you can help.
Happy to. Adam,I know
how much you love audits.
- It's gotta be done.
- If you could...
Go through the reports,find out
when they came through the rift.
OK with that? I have been
for the last three years.
You're late.
Yes,Paris was lovely,thank you!
Who the hell is this?

Adam</font>
Adam,what are you doing
with your personnel file?
Nothing,just finished updating
details of rift activity.
Any idea when this came through?
It's got a low meson energy reading.
No,I'll keep looking.
- A year ago today.
- Our first kiss.
You remembered.
You OK,Owen?
Er,yes,yes,don't worry about me.
No,no,it'sjust,er...
kissing in work...
I wasn't expecting it.
We'll celebrate tonight.
Save it.
You OK?
Yeah,fine.
- Did you miss me?
- Were you gone?
just doing a quick check.
We had rift activity two days ago,but
nothing seems to have come through.
Apart from me!
What's that?
It's a screen-cleaner.
I thought you might like it,um...
Do you like it?
just what I need. A small rodent
looking at me while I work.
Think I'll call it Owen.
HE SIGHS He's like a
puppy,bringing her sticks.
When's he gonna realise
he's got no chance?
Love's blind,apparently.
He's idolised her for years now.
0h,leave him alone.
I think it's sweet.
He's happy.
Sorry,I didn't mean to frighten you.
- How did you get in?
- With a key!
This isn't funny.
Stay back,all right? Stay back!
Gwen,what's going on?
How do you know my name? Eh?
I know how to use this.
- Who are you? What do you want?
- You know who I am...
Fine,if you won't tell me fine.
You stay there. Don't you move.
jack...
Yeah,someone's broken into my flat.
He had a key. He knows my name.
- Because I live here with you!
- Shut it! Shut it!
Can you hurry,jack? He's a nutter.
You have picked the
wrong girl to stalk,mate.
- Gwen?
- Stay there!
Jack?
Gwen,it's us!
In here,jack!
- What's going on?
- You tell me.
Look,he's put photos of us up.
He must have done it while
I was at work. He's deluded!
Says he's my boyfriend.
He is. It's Rhys.
I've never seen him before in my life!
- You've been with him for years.
- See!
Give me the gun,Gwen.
No!He grabbed me,jack.
Who knows what he was going to do?
How can you say that?!
- What have you done?
- Nothing.
0h,come on,I know what
kind of sick games you play.
Pills to make you forget... Are you
phasing me out so you can have her?
- Stay away from him.
- We're engaged!
I bought you the bloody
ring you're wearing!
Why don't you come with me to the Mont
- Who the hell are you?
- He's one of us.
We can check you. jack will
stay and take care of things.
OK.
Don't let him go. If he comes
after me again,I'll kill him.
Trust me,I didn't do this.
But whatever's happened...
we'll put it right.
Right,well,no signs of long-term
damage,as far as I can see.
Or alien intervention.
But,I must be missing something.
I'm sorry,but it's a mystery to
me why you can't remember Rhys.
Is this really necessary?
She needs to remember.
HE SIGHS Where did you meet?
Er,college.
Fancied her from the moment I saw her.
Notjust her looks,you know,I
mean she is a looker,er. ..
'Tell me about your first kiss.
'Erm,in the supermarket.
'I was going to make her spag bol. ..
'then I realised,didn't
I? 'Bloody garlic.
'Can't kiss a girl with garlic breath.
Do you remember that?
Sort of. It's like I'm...
'I said,I wanted to do something else.'
I'm seeing what he's saying,but...
I don't remember how I felt.
Believe me when I tell you
that that is your fiance.
Your memory'sjust playing
tricks on you,that's all.
'She starts to laugh.
'She calls me Rhys the Rant 'and then
she kissed me,right there in the queue.'
And I thought then,jack,I thought,'
I'm going to marry this bloody
mad woman,'even if it kills me.'
BEEPING Worked out
what that thing is yet?
No joy yet.
But you should have a look at
the detail,Tosh. It's gorgeous.
0h,let me get that.
Have you managed to open it yet?
Er,no,sorry.
I'm not doing very well,am I?
It's gonna be a long night.
Yes,which is why I brought. ..
..some sandwiches!
One for you... And one for me.
Smoked salmon,that is
your favourite,isn't it?
How d'you know that?
I'm gonna need a beer.
What,while we're working?!
0h,yeah,ofcourse.
Yeah,right,relax,kick
back,it's a good idea.
Er,not for me though,thanks!
Don't leave me,jack.
You'll be OK.
What was that all about?
Temporary amnesia. 0wen's
checking possible causes.
Weevil sighting by the
sewer in Rockall Street.
Jack_ Jack;
- Can you see him?
- Who?
I'll drop you off and
check out the sighting.
I could come with you.
It's been a while since
we went hunting together.
I'll be fine on my own.
DOOR SH UTS Go on. Live a little.
HE SIGHS Well,as it's you.
Thank you.
Call it a celebration.
Oh,yes?
Adam and I have been
together for one year today.
Right,right.
A whole year.
My stomach still flips
when he touches me.
I've never known anything like it.
The two of us,we just fit.
D'you know what I mean?
Erm,not sure I do,no.
Don't worry. You'll meet
the right girl one day.
Yeah. Tosh...
D'you really think I look like a rodent?
SHE LAUGHS Come on,we're going to
crack this box even if it kills us.
Come out,come out,wherever you are.
Giving me the runaround,huh?
You picked the wrong day,my friend.
SPLASHING Get out!
Get out,son.
Dad?
RUN!
Jack?
Was it down there? The Weevil?
No.
How did you get here?
I came with you,jack,remember?
Yeah,ofcourse.
Are you OK?
jack,what did you see?
My past.
- If what you say is true...
- It is.
We love each other.
But how could I forget that?
Nothing in. I WAS going
to take you out for a meal.
Didn't want the weekend
to finish,I suppose.
jack,please. Talk to me.
What about the past?
Is it your childhood?
I've always been here for you,jack.
From the very beginning.
I'm the one you can confide in,remember?
It was meant to be buried.
I buried the memory over 150 years ago.
Why now?
Well,maybe it's time.
Maybe up until now,your
subconscious was protecting you.
But you can't block
out the past forever.
I can't afford to remember.
- jack,talk to me,please.
- Why?
I can help. Trust me.
I'm not sure I should do this.
just tell me what you see.
I can help you. That's why I'm here.
Where are you,jack?
Boeshane Peninsula.
My home in the 51st century.
We lived under the threat of invasion.
They came without warning.
We thought they'd pass over
us,like they always did.
But they didn't.
- Not that day.
- Who?
The most horrible creatures
you could possibly imagine.
Their howls travelled before them.
Run! Take Gray. Keep him safe!
- Take Gray.
- Gray?
My little brother.
No,no,Dad. Come with us.
No,I've got to go get your mother. Run!
One minute,I was holding his hand.
I don't know when he let go.
Gray?
Gray?
Gray! Gray,where are you? Gray!
One minute,his hand was in
mine,I don't know when he let go.
I don't thinkl noticed,I thought
he was there,just behind me.
Gray!
I retraced my steps,hoping
that I'd see him again.
Did you find him?
Gray!
I ran all the way home.
Where are you? Gray!
jack,what did you find?
Dad?
No!
Can someone help? Please!
I searched for Gray for years.
I never found the body.
It wasn't your fault.
I let go of his hand!
It was the worst day of my life.
It's the last thing I want to remember.
So,according to the molecular breakdown,
this potentially alien complex
artefact is,in fact,made out of wood.
Well,perhaps it fell
in the crate by mistake.
Picked up meson energy
from the other stuff.
Yeah,right!
0h,yes,sorry,it's a stupid idea.
I thinkjack brought it in.
No,I'm sure Adam found it on
an excavation a few months back.
I'll have a look in the diary.
I like to log the interesting stuff.
You write about artefacts in your diary?
Among other things.
So,we are done for the night.
I guess.
Everything all right?
Yeah,just,Adam hasn't rung yet.
Sure he will.
I know I would,if it
was our anniversary.
I wouldn't disappear.
Infact,I would. . .cherish you.
Ah,Owen!
Yeah,no,no,really,really,Iwould.
Infact,I wouldn't let you
out of my sight,Tosh...
..because I love you.
What?
Yeah,there we are. I've
said it. I love you.
Yes,I always have,actually,ever
since we started working together,
and in fact,I actually ache for you.
When you're in the room,I want
to reach out and touch you and...
- Owen!
- No,no,no,
I can't keep this secret any more!
My mum said to me,'Seize the
day',and so I am seizing it,
and I've got so much
love to give you,Tosh,
and you won't know
that unless I tell you.
So here I am,telling
you that I love you.
You know I know there's
Adam,OK,but you know,I think...
In fact,I know that we
would be amazing together,
erm. ..if you would only
just give it a chance.
Oh,God.
Say something.
That is completely inappropriate.
- Pardon?
- What are you thinking of?
- I'm sorry,Ijust wanted you to know.
- How dare you! I'm with Adam.
And even if I wasn't. ..
you're not my type.
Never will be.
Maybe I should be on my own tonight.
No way. What if you forget who you are?
I know who I am.
It's not just you who's lost something.
MOBILE PHONE RINGS But you remember.
All you know about me.
You're my girl,my best friend.
Suddenly,all that's gone.
A stormer of a night!
What about her,mate?
Where's he going now?
He just walked off!
He knows I'm waiting.
0h,fine. I'll help myself,then!
Here you are. Keep the change.
Buy some spot cream!
I'm not coming here
again. It's overpriced.
There's a ÂŁ1.50 charge on the cash
machine. It's a bloody disgrace.
GWEN LAUGHS Honestly. Kids these days.
Don't know the meaning of hard work.
- What?
- Rhys the Rant!
Always when you're
in a queue,or driving,
or when you're on the phone to one
of those automated phone thingies. ..
Hey,it's OK. It's OK.
SHE CRIES Come on,sweetheart.
What's wrong?
My
diary.--
You're not in it.
Everyone else is.
Why would I leave you out
when you've been here so long?
Like I'm remembering a
man who doesn't exist.
What are you?
Cross me,and I will fill
you full of fake memorie
until your head is on
fire,because that's howl exist.
Gwen.
What did you do to her?
Memory is a very delicate thing.
Feeding myself in wiped
other memories out.
It's a side-effect of what I
have to do in order to survive.
jack has to know.
Remember this.
I know you didn't mean to kill her.
You just couldn't stop yourself.
Remember this.
I didn't do that.
0h,yes,you did,and she wasn't the first.
Please don't hurt me!
'Good old Ianto,loyal Ianto.
'Roaming the streets at night for bait.'
My. . .diary!
All human record is a lie.
You twist it into what
you want to believe.
But we know the rot in your heart.
You crave flesh.
No. Please.
Remember it.
Remember it. Remember it!
Remember it! Remember it!
I helped you dump the bodies.
It's me you call.
You know,I forgot what a rush
it is,feeding in the bad stuff.
Franklin? Franklin,wake up. Please!
Mom?
Where's Gray?
Where's Gray?
Where is he,son?
Where is he?
We were running so fast.
One moment,his hand was in mine...
No,not my little boy!
Not my little boy!
Why now?
Why now?
Anything?
It's still a bit of a
blur,but I'm getting there.
That's all we've got,really.
Memories.
That's what brought us to here.
To this point.
We found it before,we'll find it again.
You know,I,um,I always
worried that you'd. ..
..that you'd just
settled for me,you know.
Cos if you met me now,Gwen,with
all that goes on in your life,
could be that you
wouldn't look twice at me.
Don't say that.
- Do you remember that?
- No.
It felt like the first time.
But it was nice.
I like that.
I know.
Remind me some more.
What's wrong?
How far would you go for me?
I need to know.
Would you die for me?
Yes.
Jack;
Ianto.
What's wrong?
You'll have to put me in the vaults.
Lock me up.
I killed three girls.
Strangled them.
Stop kidding around!
I'm serious.
I murdered them,in cold blood.
I took their bodies,and...
You have to lock me away...
..before I turn on you.
None of you are safe.
Hey,hey,come here,come here.
What's happened to you?
I'm a monster.
Best lie detector on the planet.
If something's untrue,the
light turns red.
Go.
MY"` ..hands on her throat.
And it felt so good.
Squeezing the life out of her.
It reads as truth.
I don't believe it.
OK,tell me about the second girl.
She tried to get away...
..but I was too quick.
Pleading. ..
And I... I didn't care.
Something in me wants to kill.
No. This is not you.
Something's changed you.
You're not a murderer.
I'm certain of it.
'All human record is a lie.
'You crave flesh.
'Remember this.'
A year ago today... you remembered.'
Do you remember that?
'Who the hell is this?'
'just cos that's what I said to
you on your first day,remember.'
JACK REWINDS 'Remember? Remember?'
Well,I came with you,jack,remember.
Remember,remember.
I can help you
- that's why I'm here.
'Remember this.'
Come here,come here,just look,look.
'Remember it.'
IANT0 SCREAMS 'Remember
it,remember it,remember it.
'Remember it.'
Where's Adam's blood sample?
Everything's in order here.
When was it last updated?
Um...2lâ€?hours ago.
Owen...
About last night,um,it
was selfish of me.
Owen,I think the world of you. ..
I know. I'm really sorry.
I don't want to
jeopardise our friendship.
The most important thing
is that you're happy.
Thank you.
Tosh... You are...
you are happy with Adam,aren't you?
Completely.
OK.
Hey,how are you today?
Um,things are coming back slowly.
Rhys thought I shouldn't
come into work but...
Hey,we'll look after you.
You just have to give yourself time.
COITIC 0|â€™I,g|â€?Up
THEY CHAT AND GIGGLE
Hey Ianto,come here.
You all right,mate?
Listen,I could murder a coffee.
Talk to me,Adam.
If that's even your name.
- What?
- What are you doing,jack?
He's not who you think he is.
He's been feeding himself
into our memories,by touch.
Is this some kind of sickjoke?
He didn't exist until two days ago.
Can somebody tell me
what's going on,please?
jack,we've known him for years.
- He is part ofthe team.
- No.
He just made you think that.
Come on,jack.
Ah,you don't get to me like that.
jack,you know me.
You recruited me three years ago.
When I think of my team I see you there.
But I don't feel anything for you.
No pride,no warmth...
You,the one who I can confide
in,the one who unburied the dead.
jack,maybe you've forgotten
him. Like I did with Rhys?
I should have spotted it then.
That wasn't stress. That was him.
By making us think we know
him,he disturbs our real memories.
I have no idea what
you're talking about.
I'm taking him to the vaults.
-jack,this is ridiculous.
- No!
No!
- Tosh,that's not gonna help.
- It's fine.
I'm just going to lock him up.
Let him go.
I'm not going to harm him.
Why should I believe you?
Tosh,Tosh,we can talk about this.
Drop the gun,jack.
Get off me!
This is what y0u've done to us. Move.
ADAM!!
Don't kill me. I had to become part
of your memories in order to survive.
I didn't mean any harm.
- You've changed us.
- For the better!
You didn't remember who you were.
I helped you.
Look at Owen,all his cynicism gone.
He's a different man now.
Selfless,happier.
And Toshiko,too -
she's never been this confident.
How did you come here?Why us?
All of you have such unique
memories,specially you,jack.
All those extraordinary
memories you hold -
some hidden,some absent.
Your singular mind.
That's what drew me here.
Good job. It's what we do best...
wipe out aliens.
You can't shoot me. You made me live.
And you always remember
what you killed...
don't you,jack?
Our memories define us.
Adam changed those memories...
changed who we are.
Now I have to help you all go
back,find a memory that defines you.
Rediscover who you are.
If I'm wrong,he'll still be
here when we've done this.
Let me take you back
to before we all met...
Feel around for anything
that makes you what you are...
..the hidden and the forgotten.
Tell me where you are.
'The college canteen...
'Rhys is sitting opposite
me,telling stupid jokes.'
RHYS: 'Where do you find a tortoise
with no legs? Where you left it.'
'It's my birthday. I'm ten.
'Mum spends the whole day screaming,'I
love you because you're my son '
'but that doesn't mean
I have to like you.' '
'Maths club,'
something so reliable about maths...
'always the right answer.'
'Meeting Lisa,'falling in
love,'never felt so alive.'
'I turn 16. She packs my bags.'
That is the nicest thing y0u've
done for me in years,Mother.
'Kissing him in the supermarket.'
The look on his face.
'My first flat.'
I don't have a flat-warming.
'There's no-one I want to invite.'
'Losing Lisa.'
Like the world had ended.
'The way he looks at me sometimes.
'As if he's scared of what
he feels for me,' I love him.
But not in the way I love you.
Take this.
'Knowing there has to be
more to life than this.'
'Knowing I'm special,'
waiting for someone to see it.
I saw it.
You save one life,100
lives but it's never enough.
Who'll save me?
I will.
'Coming here'
gave me meaning again.
You.
You each have a short-tern amnesia
pill. It'll make you forget Adam.
We have to wipe out the last
48 hours from our memories,
go back to who we were.
I'm going to lose so much.
None of it was real.
He loved me...
and I loved him.
It's no different from real memory.
He forced it on you.
You have to let it go.
Goodbye,Adam.
just me left.
jack,I know what it's like not to exist.
Please don't send me back there.
I have to.
What are you going to do?
This will wipe out the past two days.
Well,you'll still keep the bad memories.
Because they were always yours.
But what about the good times,jack?
What about the last good
memory of you and your dad?
- It's lost.
- I can help you find it.
I can take you back there.
Before I die.
Why would you do that?
I was in the void for so long,the colours
of this world almost blinded me,jack.
It was so beautiful after the
darkness and the stench of fear.
You gave me that.
Let me do this for you.
Come on.
You want this.
It's early evening...
just me and Dad.
Oh,no,you don't!
JACK GIGGLES You're out!
You know,one day you won't want
to play with your old dad any more.
Never.
Are you there?
Yeah.
Me,Dad and...
- Dad! Mom said I could play too. ..
- Gray.
Hey,Gray!
- All right,son. One more.
- OK.
Whoa,I'll get it.
JACK LAUGHS I'm running for the ball!
Some other boy is there.
I don't know who.
- Can I play?
- Who are you?
- My name's Adam.
- Let me play.
Before it gets dark.
There's lots of room.
Hey,what are you doing?
Are you all right?
Ijust want to play.
He can play.
No!He doesn't belong here.
I don't want him playing with us.
I'm Adam.
Don't touch my dad.
Hey,easy!
Are you all right,Adam?
Yes,he just doesn't want to share.
Right,well,if you're going to
behave that way,we're going home.
- What?!
- Come on,Gray.
No,we don't leave yet.
We play some more,it gets dark,we
light a fire... Mum joins us.
Come on,son. I'll race you.
Race you!
Dad!
You did this. You spoilt it.
I made it happen.
Dad! Dad,I love you.
Dad,wait... Dad!!
I want the real memory back.
Then let me live.
That box you found contains my last
good memory of you,your dad and Gray.
You see,I'm a part of it now
and I'll always live as
long as you remember it.
That's why you took me back.
Wasn't it lovely?
Playing in the sand,no-one
knowing what was ahead...
your dad laughing.
Gray,safe and happy.
I don't want to die!
You take that pill and you will
lose everything I've given you.
Wipe me out now and you will lose
all your memories of your father.
He will cease to have existed for you.
Goodbye,Adam.
Dad! Gray!
Come back! It wasn't like this!
Dad! Gray!
jack,how have we lost two days?
What d'you mean?
The last 48 hours.
None of us can remember a thing.
The system's blank,the
CCIâ€™V's been wiped.
What's been going on?
What've we been doing?
I don't know.
Great! That's two days of my
life that I'll never get back!
Looks like Toshiko got herself
a secret admirer,though.
0h,yeah?
To Tosh,love and apologies,Owen.
They're from you!
In your dreams,Tosh. I think
someone's winding you up,darling...
No,I don't do flowers...
..and I definitely don't do apologies.
Did you call?
Found your diary.
Yep,been looking for that.
And for the record...
measuring tapes never lie.
Yep?
Who's Adam?
Don't know.

C'est au 21čme sičcle que tout
bascule, et Torchwood est pręt.
Allez !
Non, je suis déjŕ en retard !
Rhys !
Tu as hâte de retourner bosser ?
Je prends ça pour un "oui".
Te rejoindre ŕ la maison,
c'est la meilleure partie.
Artéfacts non identifiés de classe D.
- Tosh, fais une vérification complčte.
- D'accord.
Owen, tu peux aider.
- Avec plaisir.
- Adam, je sais que tu aimes les audits.
- Je vais le faire.
- Si tu pouvais...
Parcourir les rapports pour voir
quand ils sont passés par la brčche.
- Ca te va ?
- Toujours, depuis 3 ans.
Tu es en retard !
Oui, j'ai adoré Paris, merci...
Qui c'est, ça ?
C'est bien ce que je t'ai dit
ton premier jour.
Tu t'en souviens ?
<i>Un café bien fort...</i>
Désolée, j'ai pas pu résister.
Viens lŕ, toi ! Contente de te voir.
T'es trčs jolie, Tosh.

Adam, qu'est-ce que tu
fais avec ton fichier ?
Rien, je mettais ŕ jour
l'activité de la brčche.
Une idée de quand c'est arrivé ?
On peut lire un faible
niveau d'énergie méson.
Non. Je continuerai ŕ chercher.
- Ca fait un an aujourd'hui.
- Notre premier baiser.
Tu y as pensé.
Ca va, Owen ?
Oui, faites pas attention ŕ moi.
C'est juste...
S'embrasser au boulot...
Je m'y attendais pas.
On fętera ça ce soir.
Arręte ça.
Ca va ?
Oui.
- Je t'ai manqué ?
- Tu étais partie ?
Je fais une petite vérification.
La brčche a été active il y a 2
jours, mais rien ne semble ętre passé.
A part moi.
C'est quoi ?
C'est pour nettoyer l'écran.
J'ai pensé que ça te plairait.
Tu aimes ?
Juste ce qu'il me faut. Un petit
rongeur qui me regarde travailler.
Je vais l'appeler Owen.
On dirait un chiot qui
lui apporte des bâtons.
Quand va-t-il comprendre
qu'il n'a aucune chance ?
L'amour est aveugle, paraît-il.
Ca fait des années qu'il l'idolâtre.
Laissez-le tranquille.
Je trouve ça mignon.
Il est content.
Désolé, je ne voulais pas te faire peur.
- Comment ętes-vous entré ?
- Avec une clé.
- C'est pas drôle.
- Ne vous approchez pas !
- Gwen, que se passe-t-il ?
- Comment connaissez-vous mon nom ?
Je sais m'en servir.
- Qui ętes-vous, que voulez-vous ?
- Tu me connais.
D'accord, si vous ne
voulez pas me le dire...
Restez lŕ. Ne bougez pas.
Jack.
Quelqu'un est entré chez moi.
Il avait une clé. Il connaît mon nom.
Car je vis ici avec toi !
Fermez la !
Tu peux te dépęcher ? C'est un malade.
T'as mal choisi ta cible, mon ami.
- Gwen ?
- Reste lŕ.
- Jack ?
- Gwen, c'est nous !
Ici, Jack.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- A toi de me le dire.
Regarde, il a mis des
photos de nous partout.
Il a dű le faire pendant que
je travaillais. Il est fou !
Il dit qu'on est ensemble.
C'est le cas. C'est Rhys.
Je l'ai jamais vu de ma vie !
- Tu es avec lui depuis des années.
- Tu vois !
- Donne-moi ton arme, Gwen.
- Non ! Il m'a attrapée, Jack.
- Qui sait ce qu'il allait faire.
- Comment peux-tu dire ça ?
- Qu'avez-vous fait ?
- Rien.
Je sais ce que vous faites.
Des pilules d'amnésie... Vous
m'effacez pour l'avoir pour vous ?
- T'approche pas de lui.
- On est fiancés !
Je t'ai acheté la fichue
bague que tu portes !
Retourne au QG avec moi.
- Qui c'est, lui ?
- Il est des nôtres.
On fera des examens. Jack
reste ici s'occuper de tout ça.
Ne le laisse pas partir. S'il s'en
prend encore ŕ moi, je le tuerai.
Crois-moi, je n'ai rien fait.
Mais quoi que ce soit...
on va arranger ça.
Aucun signe de dommages ŕ long terme.
Ni d'intervention alien.
Mais je dois louper quelque chose.
Désolé, mais ça reste
un mystčre ŕ mes yeux.
- C'est vraiment nécessaire ?
- Il faut qu'elle s'en souvienne.
Oů vous ętes-vous rencontrés ?
A l'université.
Je l'ai aimée dčs que je l'ai vue.
Pas seulement son physique,
vous savez. Elle est superbe...
<i>Votre premier baiser ?</i>
<i>Dans un supermarché.</i>
<i>J'allais lui faire
des spaghettis bolo...</i>
<i>Puis j'ai pensé ŕ l'ail. Foutue ail.</i>
<i>On peut pas embrasser
une fille aprčs ça.</i>
Tu t'en souviens ?
En quelque sorte.
Je vois ce dont il parle, mais...
Je ne me rappelle pas
de ce que j'ai ressenti.
Crois-moi quand je te
dis que c'est ton fiancé.
Ta mémoire te joue
des tours, c'est tout.
Elle a commencé ŕ rire.
<i>Elle m'a appelé Rhys le râleur et
elle m'a embrassé, dans la file.</i>
Et je me suis dit...
Je vais épouser cette folle,
męme si ça doit me tuer.
- T'as trouvé ce que c'était ?
- Point encore.
Mais tu devrais regarder de
plus prčs. C'est magnifique.
Laisse-moi faire.
Tu as réussi ŕ l'ouvrir ?
Non, désolé.
Je ne m'en sors pas trčs bien.
La nuit va ętre longue.
C'est pourquoi j'ai amené...
des sandwiches !
Un pour toi et un pour moi.
Saumon fumé, ton préféré, non ?
Comment tu sais ça ?
Il va me falloir une bičre.
Pendant qu'on bosse ?
Oh, oui, bien sűr.
Pour se détendre, bien sűr, bonne idée.
Mais pas pour moi, merci !
Ne me laisse pas lŕ, Jack.
Ca va aller.
Alors, que se passe-t-il ?
Amnésie temporaire. Owen
étudie les différentes causes.
Un Weevil a été vu dans les
égouts prčs de Rockall Street.
Jack ?
Jack ?
- Tu le vois ?
- Qui ?
Je te dépose et j'irai voir ça.
Je peux venir.
Ca fait longtemps qu'on
a pas chassé ensemble.
Ca ira.
Allez, déride-toi.
Puisque c'est toi.
Merci.
Dis-toi qu'on fęte quelque chose.
Ah ?
Ca fait un an, Adam et moi.
Ah, oui.
Toute une année.
Et j'ai toujours des papillons
dans le ventre quand il me touche.
J'ai jamais connu ça.
On va parfaitement ensemble.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
Je ne pense pas, non.
T'inquičte pas.
Tu trouveras celle qu'il te faut.
Oui. Tosh...
Tu trouves vraiment que
j'ai une gueule de rongeur ?
Allez, on va ouvrir cette
boîte, par tous les moyens.
Sors, oů que tu sois...
Tu me fais courir ?
T'as mal choisi ton jour, mon ami.
Sors !
Sors de lŕ, fils !
Papa ?
Cours !
Jack ?
Tu l'as trouvé, le Weevil ?
Non.
Comment es-tu arrivé lŕ ?
Je suis venu avec toi,
tu t'en souviens ?
Oui, bien sűr.
Ca va ?
Jack, qu'as-tu vu ?
Mon passé.
- Si tu dis la vérité...
- Ca l'est.
On s'aime.
Mais comment j'ai pu l'oublier ?
Plus rien ŕ manger. J'allais
t'inviter au restaurant.
Je ne voulais pas que le
week-end finisse, je suppose.
Jack, je t'en prie. Parle-moi.
Quelle partie de ton passé ?
Ton enfance ?
J'ai toujours été lŕ pour toi, Jack.
Depuis toujours.
Je suis ton confident,
tu t'en souviens ?
C'était censé ętre enterré.
J'ai enterré ce souvenir il y a 150 ans.
Pourquoi maintenant ?
Il est peut-ętre temps.
Peut-ętre que jusqu'ici, ton
subconscient te protégeait.
Mais tu ne peux pas bloquer
ton passé pour toujours.
Je ne peux pas me
permettre de m'en souvenir.
- Jack, parle-moi, s'il te plaît.
- Pourquoi ?
Je peux t'aider, crois-moi.
Je ne suis pas sűr que
ce soit une bonne idée.
Dis-moi juste ce que tu as vu.
Je peux t'aider, je suis lŕ pour ça.
Oů es-tu, Jack ?
La Péninsule Boeshane.
Chez moi, au 51čme sičcle.
On vivait sous la menace
constante d'invasion.
Ils arrivaient sans prévenir.
On croyait qu'ils ne feraient
que passer, comme d'habitude.
Mais ça n'a pas été le cas.
Pas ce jour lŕ.
Les créatures les plus horribles
que l'on puisse imaginer.
Leurs hurlements les devançaient.
<i>Cours ! Prends Gray. Protčge-le !</i>
- Prends Gray.
- Gray ?
Mon petit frčre.
<i>Non, Papa. Viens avec nous.
Je dois trouver votre mčre.</i>
<i>Courez !</i>
Un instant
Je tenais sa main.
Je ne sais pas quand il a lâché.
<i>Gray ?</i>
<i>Gray ! Oů es-tu, Gray ?</i>
Sa main était dans la mienne,
je ne sais pas quand il a lâché.
Je ne l'ai pas remarqué, je le
croyais lŕ, juste derričre moi.
Je suis revenu sur mes pas
Espérant le revoir.
Tu l'as trouvé ?
J'ai couru jusqu'ŕ la maison.
Jack, qu'as-tu trouvé ?
<i>Papa ?</i>
<i>Non !</i>
<i>A l'aide</i>
<i>S'il vous plaît !</i>
J'ai cherché Gray pendant des années.
- Je n'ai jamais retrouvé son corps.
- Ce n'était pas ta faute.
J'ai lâché sa main !
Ca a été le pire jour de ma vie.
C'est la derničre chose
dont je veux me souvenir.
D'aprčs l'analyse moléculaire,
cet artefact potentiellement
alien est en réalité fait de bois.
C'est peut-ętre arrivé lŕ par erreur,
et a récupéré de l'énergie
méson des autres objets.
Bien sűr.
Oui, désolé, c'est stupide.
Je crois que c'est
Jack qui l'a ramené.
Non, Adam l'a trouvé lors d'une
excavation il y a plusieurs mois.
Je vais regarder dans mon journal.
J'aime bien y rapporter
les objets intéressants.
Tu parles des artefacts
dans ton journal intime ?
Entre autres choses.
Bien, on a fini pour ce soir.
On dirait bien.
Tout va bien ?
Oui, c'est juste qu'Adam
ne m'a pas encore appelée.
Il le fera.
Je n'y manquerais pas,
si c'était notre anniversaire.
Je ne disparaîtrais pas.
Je te gâterais.
Owen !
Non, vraiment.
Je ne te quitterais
pas des yeux, Tosh...
Parce que je t'aime.
Quoi ?
Ca y est, je l'ai dit. Je t'aime.
Je t'ai toujours aimé, depuis qu'on
a commencé ŕ travailler ensemble,
en fait, je te désire.
Quand on est dans la męme pičce,
j'ai envie de venir te toucher et...
- Owen !
- Non.
Je ne peux plus garder ça pour moi !
Ma mčre m'a dit de
profiter du moment présent.
J'ai tellement d'amour ŕ te donner,
et tu ne peux pas le savoir
si je ne te le dis pas.
Alors voilŕ, je te le dis, je t'aime !
Je sais qu'il y a Adam, mais tu sais...
Je pense, non, je sais qu'on
serait géniaux ensemble.
Si tu voulais bien
me donner une chance.
Oh, mon dieu.
Dis quelque chose.
C'est totalement inapproprié.
- Comment ?
- A quoi tu penses ?
- Désolé, je voulais que tu le saches.
- Comment oses-tu ? Je suis avec Adam.
Et męme si ça n'était pas le cas...
Tu n'es pas mon genre.
Et tu ne le seras jamais.
Je devrais peut-ętre
rester seule ce soir.
Pas question.
Et si tu oublies qui tu es ?
Je sais qui je suis.
Tu n'es pas la seule ŕ
avoir perdu quelque chose.
Mais tu t'en souviens.
Tout ce que tu sais sur moi.
T'es ma copine, ma meilleure amie.
Et tout ŕ coup, plus rien.
Oů est-ce qu'il va ?
Il vient juste de partir !
Il sait que j'attends.
Bien, je vais me servir, dans ce cas !
Et voilŕ. Garde la monnaie.
Achčte-toi du produit contre l'acné.
Je ne reviendrai plus ici.
C'est trop cher.
Deux euros de charge pour la
caisse-enregistreuse. N'importe quoi.
Les jeunes de nos jours, ils
savent plus travailler dur.
- Quoi ?
- Rhys le râleur !
Quand tu fais la queue,
ou que tu conduis,
ou au téléphone avec un de
ces opérateurs automatiques...
Ca va.
Ca va.
Viens, ma chérie.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Mon journal.
Tu n'es pas dedans.
Tous les autres y sont.
Pourquoi je ne parle pas de toi
si tu es lŕ depuis si longtemps ?
C'est comme si je me rappelais
de quelqu'un qui n'existe pas.
Qu'est-ce que t'es ?
Mets-toi sur mon chemin, et je
te remplirai de faux souvenirs
jusqu'ŕ ce que ta tęte soit en feu,
car c'est grâce ŕ ça que j'existe.
Gwen.
- Qu'est-ce que tu lui as fait ?
- La mémoire est trčs délicate.
M'intégrer ŕ ses souvenirs
en a effacé d'autres.
C'est un effet secondaire de ce
que je dois faire pour survivre.
Jack doit savoir.
Souviens-toi de ça.
Je sais que tu ne voulais pas la tuer.
Tu n'as pas pu t'en empęcher.
Souviens-toi de ça.
- Je n'ai pas fait ça.
- Oh si.
Et elle n'était pas la premičre.
<i>Ce bon vieux et loyal Ianto.</i>
<i>Parcourant les rues la nuit,
ŕ la recherche d'une proie.</i>
Mon... journal !
Tout souvenir humain est faux.
Vous les déformez en ce
que vous voulez croire.
Mais on connaît votre corruption.
- Tu veux de la chair.
- Non, pitié.
Souviens-t'en.
Souviens-t'en.
Souviens-t'en.
Souviens-t'en.
Souviens-t'en.
Je t'ai aidé ŕ te
débarrasser des cadavres.
C'est moi que tu appelles.
J'avais oublié comme c'était bon,
d'intégrer les mauvais souvenirs.
<i>Franklin ? Réveille-toi !</i>
<i>Maman ?</i>
<i>Oů est Gray ?</i>
<i>Oů est-il, mon fils ?</i>
<i>Oů est-il ?</i>
<i>On courait si vite.</i>
<i>Un instant, sa main
était dans la mienne...</i>
<i>Non, pas mon petit garçon !</i>
<i>Pas mon petit garçon !</i>
Pourquoi maintenant ?
Pourquoi maintenant ?
Du nouveau ?
C'est toujours assez flou,
mais ça vient.
C'est tout ce qu'on a, au final.
Des souvenirs.
C'est ce qui nous a amené ici.
A ce moment précis.
On l'a déjŕ trouvé, on le retrouvera.
Tu sais, j'ai toujours eu peur que...
que tu te contentes de moi.
Si tu me rencontrais maintenant,
avec tout ce qui se passe dans ta vie,
tu ne me regarderais
peut-ętre pas deux fois.
Ne dis pas ça.
- Tu te rappelles de ça ?
- Non.
C'était comme la premičre fois.
Mais c'était bien.
J'aime bien ça.
Je sais.
Rappelle-moi d'autres choses.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Jusqu'oů irais-tu pour moi ?
Je dois savoir.
Tu mourrais pour moi ?
Oui.
Jack...
Ianto.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Tu dois me mettre dans la galerie.
M'enfermer.
J'ai tué trois filles.
- Je les ai étranglées.
- Arręte ça !
Je ne plaisante pas.
Je les ai tuées de sang froid.
J'ai pris leurs corps, et...
Tu dois m'enfermer.
Avant que je m'en prenne ŕ toi.
Vous ętes tous en danger.
Viens lŕ.
Qu'est-ce qui t'es arrivé ?
Je suis un monstre.
Meilleur détecteur de
mensonge de la plančte.
Si quelque chose est faux,
la lumičre devient rouge.
Vas-y.
Mes mains sur sa gorge.
Et c'était si bon.
Enlever la vie de son corps.
Il dit que c'est la vérité.
Je n'y crois pas.
Parle-moi de la deuxičme fille.
Elle a essayé de s'enfuir...
Mais j'étais trop rapide.
Elle me suppliait...
Et je m'en fichais.
Quelque chose en moi veut tuer.
Non.
Ce n'est pas toi.
Quelque chose t'a changé.
Tu n'es pas un meurtrier.
J'en suis sűr.
<i>Tout souvenir humain est faux.</i>
<i>Tu veux de la chair.</i>
<i>Souviens-toi de ça.</i>
<i>Un an aujourd'hui... tu y as pensé.</i>
<i>Tu t'en souviens ?</i>
<i>Qui c'est, ça ?</i>
<i>C'est bien ce que je t'ai dit
ton premier jour, tu t'en souviens ?</i>
<i>Tu t'en souviens ?</i>
<i>Tu t'en souviens ?</i>
<i>Je suis venu avec toi,
tu t'en souviens ?</i>
<i>Je peux t'aider, je suis lŕ pour ça.</i>
<i>Souviens-toi de ça.</i>
Viens lŕ, regarde.
<i>Souviens-t'en.</i>
<i>Souviens-t'en. Souviens-t'en.</i>
Oů est l'échantillon de sang d'Adam ?
- Tout est en ordre ici.
- Derničre mise ŕ jour ?
Il y a 24 heures.
A propos d'hier soir, j'ai été égoďste.
- Owen, je crois que ton monde...
- Je sais. Je suis vraiment désolé.
Je ne veux pas gâcher notre amitié.
Le plus important,
c'est que tu sois heureuse.
Merci.
Tosh...
Tu es heureuse avec Adam ?
Totalement.
Hé, comment ça va aujourd'hui ?
Certaines choses
reviennent tout doucement.
Rhys ne voulait pas
que je vienne mais...
On prendra soin de toi.
Tu dois juste te laisser du temps.
Allez, câlin collectif !
Ianto, viens lŕ.
Tu vas bien ?
Je tuerais pour un café.
Dis-moi tout, Adam.
Si c'est bien ton nom.
- Quoi ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais, Jack ?
Il n'est pas celui que vous pensez.
Il s'est intégré dans nos
souvenirs par le toucher.
C'est une mauvaise blague ?
Il n'existait pas
il y a encore deux jours.
On peut m'expliquer ?
Jack, on le connaît depuis des années.
- Il fait partie de l'équipe.
- Non.
- Il vous l'a juste fait penser.
- Allez, Jack.
- Tu ne m'auras pas comme ça.
- Tu me connais.
Tu m'as recruté il y a trois ans.
Quand je pense ŕ mon
équipe, tu en fais partie.
Mais je ne ressens rien pour toi.
Aucune fierté, aucune chaleur...
Toi, mon confident.
Toi, qui a déterré les morts.
Tu l'as peut-ętre oublié.
Comme moi avec Rhys.
J'aurais dű comprendre ŕ ce moment lŕ.
C'était pas le stress, c'était lui.
En nous faisant croire qu'on le connaît,
il perturbe nos vrais souvenirs.
- Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles.
- Je l'emmčne aux galeries.
- Jack, c'est ridicule.
- Non !
Non !
- Tosh, ça n'aide pas.
- C'est bon.
Je vais juste l'enfermer.
- Laisse-le partir.
- Je ne lui ferai pas de mal.
- Pourquoi je te ferais confiance ?
- Tosh, on peut en parler.
Lâche ton arme, Jack.
Lâche-moi.
Voilŕ ce que tu nous as fait.
Ne me tue pas.
J'avais besoin de ça pour survivre.
Je ne vous voulais aucun mal.
- Tu nous as changés.
- Pour le mieux !
Tu ne te rappelais plus qui tu étais.
Je t'ai aidé.
Regarde Owen, plus du tout cynique.
Il est différent maintenant.
Généreux, heureux.
Et Toshiko...
Elle n'a jamais été aussi confiante.
Comment es-tu arrivé lŕ ?
Pourquoi nous ?
Vous avez tous des souvenirs
vraiment uniques. Surtout toi, Jack.
Tous ces souvenirs
extraordinaires que tu as.
Certains cachés, d'autres absents.
Ton esprit singulier.
C'est ce qui m'a amené ici.
Bon boulot.
C'est ce qu'on fait de mieux.
Anéantir les extra-terrestres.
Tu peux pas me tuer. Tu m'a fait vivre.
Et tu n'oublies jamais
ce que tu as tué.
N'est-ce pas, Jack ?
Nos souvenirs nous définissent.
Adam les a changés.
Nous a changés.
Je dois vous aider ŕ revenir en arričre
A retrouver vos souvenirs.
Vous redécouvrir.
Si j'ai tort,
il sera encore lŕ aprčs ça.
Revenons ŕ avant notre rencontre.
Cherchez autour de vous ce
qui pourrait vous définir.
Ce qui est caché comme oublié.
Dites-moi oů vous ętes.
<i>Au resto U.</i>
<i>Rhys est assis en face de
moi, ŕ raconter des blagues.</i>
<i>"Oů trouve-t-on une tortue sans
jambes ? Lŕ oů tu l'as laissée."</i>
<i>C'est mon anniversaire. J'ai dix ans.</i>
<i>Maman passe sa journée ŕ crier,
"Je t'aime car tu es mon fils,</i>
<i>mais ça veut pas dire
que je dois t'apprécier".</i>
<i>Club de maths.</i>
Il y a de la fiabilité dans les maths.
<i>Toujours la bonne réponse.</i>
<i>Rencontrer Lisa, tomber
amoureux, plus vivant que jamais.</i>
<i>J'ai 16 ans. Elle a fait mes bagages.</i>
C'est la meilleure chose que
tu aies fait pour moi, Mčre.
<i>L'embrasser au supermarché.</i>
Son regard.
<i>Mon premier appartement.</i>
Pas de chauffage.
<i>Je n'ai personne ŕ inviter.</i>
<i>Perdre Lisa.</i>
Comme la fin du monde.
<i>La maničre dont il me regarde parfois.</i>
<i>Comme s'il avait peur de
ce qu'il ressent. Je l'aime.</i>
Mais pas comme je t'aime toi.
Prends ça.
<i>Savoir que la vie doit ętre plus que ça.</i>
<i>Savoir que je suis spéciale.</i>
Attendre que quelqu'un le voie.
Je l'ai vu.
<i>Sauver une vie.</i>
<i>Des centaines, mais
ce n'est jamais assez.</i>
Qui me sauvera ?
Moi.
<i>Travailler ici.</i>
Ca a redonné du sens ŕ ma vie.
Toi.
Voilŕ une pilule d'amnésie pour
chacun. Ca vous fera oublier Adam.
On doit supprimer les derničres
48 heures de nos mémoires.
Redevenir ceux que nous étions.
Je vais perdre tant de choses.
Rien n'était vrai.
Il m'aimait.
Et je l'aimais.
C'est comme de vrais souvenirs.
Il ne t'a pas donné le choix.
Tu dois oublier ça.
Au revoir, Adam.
Plus que moi.
Jack, je sais ce que
c'est de ne pas exister.
Ne me renvoie pas lŕ bas.
Je le dois.
Que vas-tu faire ?
Ca va supprimer les deux derniers jours.
Tu garderas quand męme
les mauvais souvenirs.
Car ils ont toujours été lŕ.
Et les bons moments, Jack ?
Le dernier bon souvenir
de toi et ton pčre ?
- Il est perdu.
- Je peux t'aider ŕ le retrouver.
Je peux te ramener lŕ bas.
Avant de mourir.
Pourquoi tu ferais ça ?
Je suis resté si longtemps dans le
néant, ce monde m'a presque aveuglé.
C'était si beau aprčs les
ténčbres et les relents de peur.
C'est toi qui m'as donné ça.
Laisse-moi faire ça pour toi.
Allez.
Tu en as envie.
C'est le début de soirée.
Juste papa et moi.
<i>Oh non !</i>
<i>Tu sors !</i>
<i>Tu sais, un jour tu ne voudras
plus jouer avec ton vieux pčre.</i>
<i>Jamais.</i>
Tu y es ?
Oui.
Papa, moi et...
<i>Maman a dit que je pouvais jouer.</i>
<i>Hé, Gray !</i>
<i>Allez, encore une.</i>
<i>J'y vais.</i>
Je cours aprčs la balle !
Un autre garçon est lŕ.
Je ne le connais pas.
<i>- Je peux jouer ?
- Qui es-tu ?</i>
<i>- Je m'appelle Adam.
- Laisse-moi jouer.</i>
Avant qu'il ne fasse nuit.
<i>Il y a assez de place.</i>
<i>Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?</i>
<i>- Ca va aller ?
- Je veux juste jouer.</i>
<i>- Il peut jouer.
- Non ! Sa place n'est pas ici.</i>
<i>- Je ne veux pas qu'il joue avec nous.
- Je m'appelle Adam.</i>
<i>- Touche pas mon pčre.
- Du calme !</i>
<i>Ca va, Adam ?</i>
<i>Oui, il ne veut pas partager.</i>
<i>Si c'est comme ça, on rentre.</i>
<i>- Quoi ?
- Viens, Gray.</i>
Non, on ne part pas encore.
On joue encore, la nuit tombe, on
allume un feu. Maman nous rejoint.
<i>Viens, fiston. On fait la course.</i>
<i>La course !</i>
<i>Papa !</i>
<i>C'est ta faute. Tu as tout gâché.</i>
Je l'ai créé.
<i>Papa !
Papa!</i>
<i>Je t'aime.</i>
Papa, attends !
Papa !
Je veux retrouver mon vrai souvenir.
Alors épargne-moi.
La boîte contient mon dernier
souvenir de toi, ton pčre et Gray.
J'en fais partie, maintenant.
Et je vivrai tant que
tu t'en souviendras.
C'était pour ça ?
C'était pas charmant ?
Jouer dans le sable,
le futur encore inconnu.
Ton pčre riant.
Gray, sain et sauf.
Je ne veux pas mourir !
Prends cette pilule et tu
perdras tout ce que je t'ai donné.
Efface-moi et tu perdras tous
les souvenirs de ton pčre.
Il cessera d'exister.
Au revoir, Adam.
Papa !
Gray !
Revenez ! Ca ne se passe pas comme ça !
Papa !
Gray !
Jack, comment a-t-on
perdu deux jours ?
- Comment ça ?
- Les derničres 48 heures.
Aucun de nous ne s'en souviens.
Le systčme est vierge,
les caméras effacées.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on a fait ?
Je ne sais pas.
Super ! Deux jours de ma vie
que je ne retrouverai jamais !
On dirait que Toshiko
a un admirateur secret.
Ah bon ?
"Pour Tosh, toutes mes excuses, Owen".
C'est de toi.
Dans tes ręves, Tosh. Quelqu'un
te fait une mauvaise blague.
Je n'offre pas de fleurs.
Et je ne m'excuse jamais.
Tu m'as appelé ?
- J'ai trouvé ton journal.
- Je le cherchais.
Et au fait...
Les mčtres ne mentent jamais.
Qui est Adam ?
Aucune idée.
<i>On a une victime de
meurtre et une survivante.</i>
<i>Attaques avec aiguille,
dossiers médicaux effacés.</i>
<i>Je parie sur ce truc.
Ça vient du sang de Marie.</i>
J'avais le SIDA.
C'est impossible.
<i>Elle est tellement normale
qu'elle est anormale.</i>
<i>Nous sommes ŕ l'aube de la plus
grande découverte de l'histoire.</i>
Ça doit bien valoir quelques sacrifices.
<i>Il ne s'agit pas d'un maniaque
obsédé par les aiguilles.</i>
<i>C'est une conspiration.</i>
<i>Le corps revient ŕ ses
paramčtres de départ.</i>
<i>Une forme de vie extra-terrestre
s'intčgre au sang humain.</i>
 C'est absurde.
Je dois y entrer.
<i>Mlle Martha Jones.</i>

Torchwood. Outside the government,
beyond the police.
Fighting for the future
on behalf of the human race.
The 21st century
is when everything changes. . .
and Torchwood is ready.
WEEVIL ROARS
He's dead.
BELLJANGLES
Sorry, we're closing.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Documents on the body identify
the victim as Meredith Roberts.
No obvious signs of violence.
Are we saying it wasn't the Weevil?
Give me a chance, Miss Cooper.
I've only just started.
'Jack, your VIP visitor is here.'
I didn't realise
we were having a visitor.
Suddenly, in an underground
mortuary, on a wet night in Cardiff,
I hear the song of a nightingale.
Miss Martha Jones.
Oh, it's good to see you, Jack.
Toshiko, Owen, Gwen,
Ianto, meet Martha.
Just a casual visit or. . . ?
I'm here to complete your postmortem.
Dr Jones is from UNIT.
Oh, I'm sorry, sorry, I get
a bit confused. Which one's UNIT?
Intelligence, military,
cute red caps.
The acceptable face of
intelligence gathering on aliens.
We're more ad hoc.
But better looking.
I identified a pattern
from UNIT's data on sudden deaths.
Toxic shock. Nothing to link
the victims. Different ages, sexes,
ethnic origins, occupations.
But there was
a statistically significant
concentration in South Wales.
Come on, Martha, be honest. You
just came all this way to see me.
Still struggling to conquer
your shyness, Jack?
So what about this pattern,
then, Dr Jones?
They were being written off
as suicides or accidents.
Look.
Puncture mark.
Hypodermic needle.
You'll find his bloodstream was
pumped full of ammonium hydroxide.
Bloodstream.
I was going to do that next.
Have you checked his medical records?
No. I wasjust about to.
Let's give it a go. You never know,
Owen, you might learn something.
One Meredith Roberts, age 45.
I know there's been a major crash
on the NHS system.
Wiped a shedload of files.
Including all the victims I flagged
up from the UNIT data. And now yours.
A computer crash wouldn't delete
data so cleanly. This is deliberate.
Let me look into it.
How's the family? Getting better.
They send their love. Give them mine.
So, End of the World Survivors Club.
God, I am so glad to see you, Jack!
See, you did come all this way
just to see me. It's the jaw line.
Once seen, always yearned for.
D'you miss him?
No. I made my choice.
Maybe sometimes. Ah!
Tiny bit. Tiny, tiny.
Then I come to my senses again.
Anyway, I've got plenty to occupy me.
Oh, yeah, Miss Highfalutin'.
What is it? Medical officer?
Oh, yes.
So do I have to call you ma'am? No.
Just follow my orders to the letter.
You should have called me
if you were looking for a job.
I wasn't. This woman from UNIT
rang out of the blue,
said I was just what they needed,
that I'd come highly recommended
by an impeccable source.
You mean. . . ?
Well, who else would have done it?
He must have thought
he owed you a favour.
Guess we all do.
Do you think you could get me one of
those white caps for personal use?
Ianto might look good in it.
You want uniforms, get your own. Now,
am I going to get the guided tour?
Yes, ma'am, whatever you say, ma'am!
Huah! Leave it!
So that's the hot house. Tour
continues this way, ladies, please.
No dawdling. Um, so,
you know Jack pretty well, then?
Oh, we were only together
for. . .a few days.
But it was pretty intense.
You mean. . . ? Oh, God, no!
No, not that sort of intense.
Nothing like that.
Why? Are you and him. . . ?
No, no, not at all.
We must be the only two people
on the planet.
I know. What are we doing wrong?
Oi, you talking about me?
No, no, we were just discussing
alien flora, weren't we? Oh, yeah.
She's no fun.
Raise your game, girls!
You've got some well weird kit.
What's this?
Be careful. It's an alien artefact.
There's a lot of argument
about this.
But for my money, it's got to be
a surgical instrument. Really?
He's guessing. Typical medic. Hmm.
Well,
I call it a singularity scalpel.
See, what it does is concentrates
energy on a tiny fixed point without
damaging anything on the way.
It's brilliant. It's amazing. Yeah,
do you remember the last time
you did that, Owen. . . ? Yes.
Right, now,
all we're going to do is,
we're going to vaporise this paper
without even scorching the cup.
This is going to end in tears.
OK.
Aagh!
Er, haven't quite got
the calibration right yet.
Jack, there's been another attack.
Assault with a hypodermic.
Only this time, the victim survived.
Woman, aged 27.
She's in the hospital.
Medical records wiped,
just like the others.
Yeah, but the doctors
said they'd finished with me.
We're a bit different.
We know this is tough on you, Marie.
But did you recognise
the man who attacked you?
I already told the police.
We're different from them, too.
No, I never seen him before.
Did he say anything
in the course of the attack? No.
Open wide.
Look, he just,
he came towards me with a great
big bloody needle, didn't he?
You know, my dog bit him and then
I kicked him in the nuts. Respect!
MUSIC: "Feel Good Inc" by Gorillaz
This is a. . .three four.
So you and Jack go back a long way?
Forward and back, really.
What brought you together?
Let's say we were
under the same doctor.
These killings -
why the ammonium hydroxide?
It's a weird way to kill someone.
Yeah, it's gross. It's like
injecting them with bleach.
Unless the objective
isn't just killing.
It's destroying something
in the victim's bloodstream.
It's getting rid of evidence!
Locally, we've got a murder victim
and a survivor.
Both attacked with hypodermics, both
with their medical records wiped.
And more cases across the UK.
We think the point of the attacks
is to destroy evidence
of their medical condition.
Gwen, Ianto, pursue
the criminal investigation. OK.
Martha, Owen will follow up
with the medical side. Fine.
Tosh, any luck in retrieving
those medical records? Not yet.
I'm gonna have to dig down
into the system memories,
see if I can find any remnants
of deleted or temporary files.
Completely illegally, of course.
Do what you have to.
We're not dealing with a freak
with some needle fetish.
This is a conspiracy.
Ianto, the police have found
another body in Heath Park.
It's got all the hallmarks
of the other attacks.
I'll get Gwen, head out there now.
What have you got?
Body was found early this morning.
Caucasian male, early 20s.
OK, thanks.
Who is he? Barry Leonard. Student.
Doctor said it looked like. . .
Toxic shock.
The attack took place in the woods,
so no witnesses, no CCTV.
Same as the others.
Yeah. Tosh just checked Barry's
medical records - already wiped.
The puncture mark on his eyeball was
identical to the other victims.
I mean, Jack's right.
These attacks are not random,
they're clinical. Professional.
More like assassinations.
Except Barry Leonard was a student.
Who'd assassinate a student?
Student Loans Company. Yeah, yeah,
I think you've just cracked it.
But why delete medical records?
You know, what did all these people
have in common? Owen's analysing
Marie's test results now.
So we've got no idea where the
killer will strike next and the
attacks are getting more frequent.
We keep looking, Gwen,
we'll find something.
'Martha, call from the hospital.
'Marie's had some sort of seizure.'
They want us at the hospital.
Marie's collapsed.
Yeah? My money's on this stuff. From
Marie's blood. It's a new one on me.
Yeah, me too. Have you run
an isoenzyme analysis on it?
No, not yet. What are you thinking?
Parasitic infection? Could be.
It's got to be down to this stuff,
or I haven't got a clue
what's wrong with her.
Yeah - no infections,
no deficiencies in organ function,
perfect cholesterol levels,
ideal blood pressure. Yeah, exactly.
She's so normal, she's abnormal.
Marie? Marie, can you hear me?
Mmm, yeah.
OK, you've got something
in your blood that
we don't recognise, all right?
We think it's behind
your current illness
and we need to know what's been
happening to you so we can help you.
Well, you're the doctors.
You tell me.
'Barry was my best mate.
We were doing the same course.'
Met him on the first day.
Was Barry doing
any sort of drugs at all?
Well, he used to be really clean.
Reckoned he had to be careful
about what went into his body
because of his diabetes.
Barry was diabetic?
Sure. But when they cured that,
he was doing booze, blow. . .
Wait a minute. You're telling me
Barry's diabetes was cured? Sure.
That's impossible. Well, he stopped
taking insulin. He was fine.
Owen, something you should know.
So who performed this miracle cure?
He was very quiet about that.
All I know is, he was suddenly
flashing a load of wedge about.
Barry Leonard is said to
have recovered from diabetes.
Thanks, Ianto.
Listen, Marie,
you're gonna have to level with us.
This could be a matter of
life and death. Have you ever
had a serious medical condition?
Too good to be true.
What do you mean?
I had HIV.
You're perfectly clear of antibodies.
That's not medically possible.
That's the Reset. Reset?
What are we talking about? A drug?
Right, I'm not familiar with Reset,
so any idea of a chemical name?
Where d'you get it from, Marie?
I got it from the Pharm. The farm?
What farm?
No, P-H-A-R-M, the Pharm.
It's a medical research place,
all right?
How did you get it from there?
They gave it to me.
They paid me a lot of money. They
said I should to keep quiet about
it cos it was part of the contract.
Are you saying you were
a clinical trial subject?
Marie? Convulsing. Marie!
I'll give her another 10ml.
You're all right.
MONITOR FLATLINES
She's dead.
BUZZING
Emergency! Get us out of here!
BUZZING INCREASES
So it's an alien larva,
incubating in human bodies.
We've never seen anything like it.
So it left Marie's body
when she died,
looking for another host
for its next stage of development.
Which could have been us. Yeah.
Fortunately, when they didn't
find one quickly, they died.
I wonder what this cute
little larva grows up to be?
This, folks, is a molecular model
of the drug that
we found in Marie's blood.
She called it Reset.
So what does it do?
Think about when you run a virus
scan through your computer, yeah?
The software works its way through
the files and when it finds
a Trojan or a virus or whatever,
identifies it and then deletes it.
That is what this stuff does
to the human body.
But it's not just viruses.
It's harmful bacteria, toxins,
even mutant cells, you name it.
It's like the body's been turned
back to its factory settings.
It's the ultimate magic bullet.
Supersedes anything and everything
in the pharmacological armoury.
That would be the greatest medical
discovery in history. Exactly.
Except, it comes bundled
with a lethal alien parasite.
Ah, not so good a discovery.
The parasite needs a healthy body
until it's incubated.
So the parasite egg
incorporates this magic bullet,
which puts everything in the system
back to its factory settings. Reset.
Neato.
So who runs the Pharm? Well,
the public image is innocent enough.
Private-public partnership between
the government and a consortium
of the pharmaceutical companies.
Researching and developing
cutting-edge biotechnology.
Their IT systems are way more
cutting-edge than they need to be.
Plus, they've got seemingly
unrestricted security clearance.
Which means they'd have
the capability to erase
medical records if they wanted to.
Exactly. Who runs this outfit?
Institute director is a Dr Aaron
Copley. Yeah, I know his work.
He's one of the most respected
research scientists in his field.
Harvard graduate.
Did research at Cambridge.
Last job, Harvard Professor
of Molecular Pharmacology.
Came to the UK to set up the Pharm.
Hmm, he's kinda handsome, too.
D'you think he'll like visitors?
Torchwood.
Sorry you've had
a wasted journey, Mr. . .Harker.
Harkness. And it's Captain,
but you can call me Jack.
Captain?
Where did you park your boat?
I like a man with a sense of humour.
Know any good gags
about clinical trials?
Well, Jack, none of these faces
mean anything to me.
And as the institute director,
I would have met them personally,
had they been our trial subjects.
Dr Copley. . . Professor, actually.
But I can call you Aaron, right?
See, this is a little awkward.
Two of these people were murdered.
Another died of a parasitic
infection of alien origin
and one of the victims mentioned
your organisation's name
shortly before she died.
Alien origin? That's preposterous.
Er, Professor,
when I was writing my MD thesis,
your published works on immunology
were very helpful, so thank you.
Glad to be of service.
Now, if there was a drug
that could restore the human body
back to its factory settings,
as it were, you would know about it.
You're right, I would.
But nothing like that exists.
I had a boyfriend whose
nostrils flared when HE was lying.
I'm already late
for my next appointment.
You go ahead.
We'll have a look around.
Well, obviously our research suites
are classified,
so we can't grant you access
to those, but we'd be delighted
to give you the PR tour.
Normally, Aaron,
we go where we like.
Not here, actually.
Ask Whitehall.
We're fireproof.
Yeah. I had a bad experience
with a politician recently.
I tend not to listen
to Whitehall any more.
Let me get someone to guide you
back to your vehicle.
Was it me,
or was he a little touchy?
Yeah, so much for
the polite approach.
We need to turn this place over.
BEEPING
Oh, yeah.
Cos this place has the highest
concentration of alien life forms
this side of the Rift.
Grey is so not her colour.
I can't hack in there, Jack.
And if I keep trying
a brute-force approach,
they'll know they're under attack.
An alien life form is preying
on humans. I need a way in there.
Tosh, I've got the results of that
research. On the screen now.
Ianto, that's brilliant! They're
in the market for volunteers.
That's understandable,
given their wastage rate.
One of us goes in undercover.
No, we don't know enough about it.
Too many things could go wrong.
Unless you put a medic in there.
Someone who knew what to look for.
Yeah, but I can't do it.
They know me now.
I know it's hard to believe, Owen,
but I wasn't thinking of you.
No way.
Come on, Jack, I've been
in worse places and you know it.
OK.
Jack, can I have a word?
I know you're big buddies
from way back whenever, but you
can't just send her in like this.
Trust me. She's more than capable.
I'd rely on Martha
if the world was ending.
In fact, I did.
OK, these are the plans
for the Pharm's buildings.
From what Jack and Owen saw,
they reckon that the main house
contains Copley's office,
medical research suites
and the accommodation
for the clinical trials subjects.
What about the rear buildings?
Restricted area,
fenced off, armed security.
Jack thinks that's where
the readings of alien life
forms came from. Cool.
But you don't need to go anywhere
near there. Spoilsport.
The first thing you need to do
is get yourself accepted
as a clinical trials subject.
Don't try too hard, don't draw
too much attention to yourself.
Be invisible. I can do that.
Once you're in, we need you to gain
access to the Pharm's IT systems,
close down the system firewalls
and security protocols.
Tosh can gain access to the files
and see what they're up to.
Industrial espionage.
It's very civilised. Once you've
done that, get out. Don't take any
unnecessary risks. Understood. Cool.
So, Jack asked me if I could
get you a UNIT cap to wear.
Did he? Well, red is my colour.
So am I right in thinking
that you and he. . . ?
We. . .dabble.
Yeah? Yeah.
So what's his dabbling like?
Innovative. Really?
Bordering on the avant garde.
Wow.
Oh, yeah.
Huh. So shall we get
your cover story sorted? Absolutely.
Fake ID.
First name Samantha.
Thought the Jones would be safe.
OK. How do I stay in touch?
Communication's very tricky.
The whole place could be wired.
We don't want you chattering away
to us and being overheard.
But I want to monitor you
at all times. So?
I don't need contact lenses.
You need these. OK?
Oh, I'm a camera! As Chris Isherwood
once said to me when we were
cruising the Kurfurstendamm.
And we. . .can. . .text.
Wow! Power comes from the body heat,
so they only work
when you're wearing them.
Yeah, so you have to wear them
everywhere. I'll do some things
with my eyes shut, then.
In an emergency,
we can speak directly to you.
The lens will communicate with
your sensory neuroreceptors.
Bypasses the auditory system.
But can't these signals
be intercepted?
Alien technology. Which exploits
a solution to the EPR paradox.
Oh, quantum entanglement
of remote particles. OK, cool.
Did I mention she was brilliant?
It's standard procedure to take
two blood tests. One of them
will be analysed overnight.
Thank you, Nurse. So tell us
the places you've been to, Samantha.
Well, I had a great time
in North America, France
and Germany, Australia. . .
What about the Third World?
Africa, Latin America?
No, but I'm sure
I'll get round to it.
Travel off the beaten track
can be a bit of a problem for us.
If you had some exotic tropical
disease, there could be unexpected
side effects,
and volunteers' welfare
is our absolute priority.
I don't think there'll be any
problem with that. And I'm very
conscious of health issues.
My mum's a nurse.
This is Professor Copley, Samantha.
Institute director.
Hi, Sam. Nice to meet you.
Tell her to get close to Copley.
I see you're a postgraduate
student at the moment.
- That's right.
- Studying what?
- Creative writing.
So I really need the cash.
I'm sure you'll understand,
Samantha, that we have a lot of
applicants. Tell her not to lose him.
We'll let you know in due course.
- Actually, there's something
I should have told you.
- Oh, yes?
It'll show up in
the test results anyway.
I did have a hepatitis infection.
No, no, no, she's bullshitting.
It's her way in.
I mean, I'm fine now,
but it stays in the blood.
Strictly speaking,
it's incurable, right?
That puts a different
complexion on things.
We could use a
subject with hepatitis.
- Are you available
to start right now?
- Well, sure.
I've brought my overnight things.
Then all we need is your signature
on this confidentiality agreement.
She's in.
As Chris Isherwood also said,
it's not the getting in,
it's the getting out.
- Thank you.
- What sort of drugs
will you want me to take?
We have got various products
at the clinical trials stage.
You'll be given a briefing
once we've finalised the programme,
and of course we won't proceed
unless we have your informed consent.
Come on, Martha.
Let her settle in.
It's gonna be a long night ahead.
You and Martha are getting on well.
Yeah, you know me - Mr Sociable.
She's beautiful. Is she?
You know she is.
Yes, well, fair cop.
And a doctor.
Perfect match.
No, she's only interested in work.
Do you think? Yeah, a bit of
flirting so I'll show her the ropes.
Plus, if I tried anything with her,
I think Jack would have my kneecaps.
What happened
to that, um, pool tournament
you were organising? That?
It was never a tournament.
What was all that about, then?
It was supposed to be a date. Sorry?
I was asking you out on a date.
A date?
You didn't realise? You and me?
Yeah.
I see. And. . .you still want that?
Yeah.
Right.
I just thought if we spent
some time together, an evening. . .
All right.
Sorry?
Just do it. Are you being sarcastic?
No.
You're being polite. You'll stand me
up. I've just said yes, haven't I?
One date, see how it goes,
which might be nowhere.
That's fine. A drink. OK. Yeah.
I'm going to keep
flirting with people, OK?
Just cos of this, doesn't mean
I'm going to stop flirting.
You can be king of flirts. OK.
Right, then.
Yeah.
Good. We should, er. . .
concentrate on Martha.
Yeah.
Tosh, can you get us past this?
Easy peasy.
She just needs to get the
lenses to within the EPR field.
Tosh, can you help her blag her
way into the computer system?
It'll take time to talk
her through it. We don't have time.
I want her out of that office.
Well, if I can get her to give me
remote control of the computer. . .
. .I have control.
The life cycle of the parasite.
They call it the Mayfly. Wow.
We've never seen a species
like that before. It's beautiful.
It's lethal.
But what is Copley doing with them?
Martha, now we've got control,
we can go through all of this here.
Get out of there pronto.
Do you have that code-breaker
software? I'm sending the patch now.
Thank you.
'Break out in Zone A.
All return to Zone A immediately.
'Breakout in Zone A.
Break out in Zone A.'
ALARM RINGS
'All patrols proceed
with extreme caution.
'The escaped creature
is extremely dangerous.'
Jack? I've got the list of the
clinical trials subjects here.
Meredith Roberts,
Marie Thomas, Barry Leonard.
All the murder victims.
Ooh, who's BD?
Executive actions?
The Pharm are running
their own hit man,
which is unusual
for a medical research facility.
Wait, there's a name here
that we haven't seen before.
Elin Morgan? She hasn't been
reported missing or dead.
She soon will be.
Take Ianto and pull her in.
ALARM RINGS
APPROACHING VOICES
'Do not attempt to approach
the creature, is that understood?
'Stun and sedate only,
the creature is highly dangerous.'
Understood. Come on, keep moving!
If the Pharm have their own hit man,
God knows what they're capable of.
Yeah, and I put her in there.
WHISTLE BLOWS
EERIE WARBLING
Shit! What was that? Radiation
surge? We've lost her signal!
Agh! Ah!
EERIE WARBLING CONTINUES
Agh!
There it is!
Call patrol. Creature located.
I can't get her back.
We have to get her out of there.
That place is swamped in security.
If we steam in, we'll be putting her
at risk! We can't leave her there.
If I can't get her signal in 30
minutes, we think of alternatives.
Anything could be happening to her.
Martha can handle herself.
She's been in worse situations
than this. Sure about that?
What's that? Billy Davis' mobile.
He'll be at Elin's flat
in three minutes.
Hands above your head! Up!
Jack, we've got Billy Davis. He
could help get you into the Pharm.
Will you tell this gorilla to
let me go? ! What is going on? !
- Good work.
- You can't treat me like this!
- You lied to us, Samantha.
Can I just explain? I got bored stuck
in that room, so I went for a walk,
and first that thing attacked me,
and then your heavies assaulted me.
You don't owe any
loyalty to Torchwood.
- Jack Harkness has treated you
in a criminally irresponsible way.
- Who? I really don't understand!
Don't bother.
This is not an interrogation.
Torchwood is irrelevant to us,
not even a nuisance.
In fact, they've done us
quite a favour putting you in here.
We've analysed your test results -
you really are something special.
Agh!
I got terrible guts, dunno what
it is. Bad conscience, Billy.
Try confessing. Get stuffed.
OK, let's do it the hard way.
CREATURE GROWLS
Merciful Christ! What the. . . ?
Agh-hhh!
CREATURE ROARS
They have a tendency to act up.
Losing him! Please!
Something to say, Billy?
Yeah, yeah, whatever you want, just
get it away from me! Get it off me!
OK, Billy, you've been
on a killing spree, why?
I work for the Pharm!
They'd been giving people
this Reset drug.
But there were these side effects -
parasites or something.
They were gonna die anyway, so I had
to get rid of them before any weird
symptoms showed up. . .in public.
Do you know what lymphocytes are,
Samantha?
A kind of white blood cell,
part of the immune system.
Well, your lymphocytes are really
quite extraordinary.
We've never seen anything like
them before, not in a human being.
Aliens are a different matter.
Aliens? I don't know
what you're talking about.
Your lymphocytes and God knows
what other cells have mutated.
- Mutated? How?
- Under the influence of radiation.
Radiation
that's not found in the temporally
stable environments on Earth.
I don't know what that means.
We've dealt with aliens before,
but we have never come across
anything as exotic as you.
A human being who's
travelled in time and space.
Tell me about it.
How is that possible?
What did you see out there?
This is mad.
I don't know what you mean.
Fine. If that's the
way you want to play it.
However it happened, it means you
have a uniquely effective immune
system, which is what we need.
We're developing a drug that's
going to change the world, Sam.
Incurable cancers, AIDS - all the
scourges of the human race wiped out.
A revolution in medicine
and social welfare.
Except it's still imperfect.
I'd like to know what your funky
lymphatic system makes of
those imperfections.
I am not taking that!
But you volunteered.
OK, we're going into the Pharm
and you're going to front it.
Yeah, yeah. OK.
My stomach! My stomach!
My stomach! Agh!
Agh! Whoa!
Owen, we need him alive! Yeah, all
right, I'm flying blind here, Jack!
Do something! Let's start with this.
I think I've got it, OK?
I've got the calibrations right.
I can get it out of him.
Whoa! God! Owen, deal with it.
Are you sure you had
those calibrations right?
I'm sorry, all right?
He must have breathed in larva
when one of his victims died.
This could have been me, or Martha.
I've given her twice
the critical dose.
So, Mayfly larvae are incubating?
Are you sure about this? Her
immune system's clearly reacting.
There's obviously
quite a fight going on inside her.
Keep your nerve.
We're making history.
Ianto, what have you done
with Billy Davis' body?
Um, I was just about to
dispose of it. Why?
I've thought of a way we can
use him to get us into the Pharm.
Clever, huh?
Oh, you are warped on the inside.
How do you think of these things?
I'll take that as a compliment.
Tosh, Gwen, Ianto, check out Zone A.
We're going after Martha. Let's go!
Hands above your head!
What have you done to her?
Tell me that's not Reset!
She's survived the larval stage,
the only subject ever to do so.
Fascinating. Turns out these
bugs practice sibling cannibalism.
Only the strongest individual is left
now. God knows what happens next.
Put a stop to this! I can't.
I don't know how.
Put your hands above your head!
Ianto.
Bloody hell.
Jack, this thing's killing her.
I don't know what I can do.
Owen, stay calm,
there has gotta be something.
What's happening here?
This is what the Pharm is all about.
We farm captive aliens
for the exotic chemical
products they metabolise.
What the hell do you get from
a weevil? Some pesticides, and a
quite powerful chemical defoliant.
But the weevils aren't what's
going to clinch the Nobel for us.
The Mayfly, our feedstock for Reset.
Given time, we'll tweak the
product for human use, and then
it'll be bigger than penicillin.
Jack, I can give you
a report on Zone A.
They're holding dozens
of creatures. They seem to be
using them as test subjects.
Understood, Ianto.
Tell Tosh to go for total shutdown.
This place is a torture chamber.
I don't need to debate
medical ethics with you.
You abused the Mayflies,
you turned them into parasites!
We didn't understand how
the Mayflies reproduced.
We tried to limit the damage.
What, by murdering people?
They were going to die anyway.
We're on the edge of
the greatest discovery in history.
It has to be worth a few sacrifices!
You must understand that, Jack,
you're involved in alien research.
Not like this.
I'm closing this place down.
In your dreams. This is a state
of the art, official facility.
Oh, I'm not going to
do it by sending a memo.
We're in control of your IT systems.
As we speak, we're crashing your
data banks, wiping your records.
That's cyber terrorism!
And that'sjust for starters.
We're going to trip the systems
of your fire, radiation and
biohazard safety networks.
The power will be cut,
sprinklers will be activated,
and a large part of this facility
will be sealed and flooded with
inert gases. The aliens will die.
They're already dying. This way
they'll be put out of their misery.
For God's sake,
we're on the same side!
No. Combating hostile aliens
is one thing, but this is slavery,
exploitation, a war crime!
Jack, I need your help!
What the hell are you doing? !
This is the only way
we'll save Martha.
I think I understand how it works.
You'd better be sure
because it's never worked before.
Owen, are you sure it's safe? OK,
Jack! Owen, tell me you're sure!
You could kill her with that thing!
We're losing her!
Ah!
A SINGLE TONE BLEEPS
What have you done?
Oh, bloody hell, it worked.
Thank God for that.
Let's get her out of here.
I am prescribing rest and
recuperation for you, madam,
and a few days in bed,
preferably under my supervision.
Owen, I don't know how to break
this to you - I've got a boyfriend.
Yeah, but has he saved your life
like I did?
Um, yes, actually.
Oh.
Arms up on there.
Do it.
'Facility shut down programme. All
personnel must evacuate immediately.
'Facility shut down programme.
'All personnel must
evacuate immediately.'
OK, let's go!
Did you really think I was
going to let you just walk away?
You've ruined everything I've worked
for. Now, let's not be stupid. OK?
We're both rational men, scientists.
I know you don't want to shoot.
You're next!
Owen! Can you hear me, Owen? !
You've got to help him!
Owen, stay with me. Owen.
Owen, look at me, look at me.
Owen, look right at me.
Stay with me, Owen, stay with me.
Stay with me, buddy. Come on.
Owen, speak to me!
He's dead.
Owen. . .
The time is 21.30.
Autopsy on Owen Harper.
Torchwood officer 565.
Aged 27.
Autopsy begins.
The energy just went off the scale.
Can you see where it is?
You can't use it.
Who knows what'll happen!
I was hoping for a miracle.
Where did he go? It's here. Martha!
It must be death,
because it's stolen my life.

Excusez-moi, madame.
Les papiers trouvés sur la victime
indiquent Meredith Roberts.
<i>Pas de signes de violence.</i>
Ça n'était pas les weevils ?
Laissez-moi une chance, Mlle Cooper.
Je viens de commencer.

Je ne savais pas

C'est bon de te voir, Jack.
Toshiko, Owen, Gwen, Ianto.
Voici Martha.
Une visite de courtoisie ou... ?
Je viens compléter
le rapport d'autopsie.
Le Dr Jones travaille pour UNIT.
Désolée, je confonds tout.
Lequel est UNIT ?
Intelligence, militaire,
de mignons bonnets rouges.
La face acceptable de l'étude
de l'intelligence extra-terrestre.
On est plus spécialisés.
<i>Mais plus beaux.</i>
J'ai trouvé un motif récurrent dans
la base de données de morts soudaines.
Choc toxique.
Rien ne relie les victimes.
Ages, sexes, origines ethniques
et occupations différents.
Mais il y en a une concentration
statistique au sud du Pays de Galles.
Allez, Martha. Avoue. Tu as fait
tout ce chemin juste pour me voir.
Tu luttes toujours contre ta timidité ?
Alors, ce motif, Dr Jones ?
Ils sont rapportés comme
suicides ou accidents.
Regarde.
<i>Une marque de ponction.</i>
Aiguille hypodermique.
Tu trouveras de l'ammonium
hydroxyde dans son sang.
Oui, son sang. J'allais m'en occuper.
Tu as regardé son dossier médical ?
- Non, j'allais le faire.
- Perdons pas de temps.
On ne sait jamais, Owen,
tu pourrais apprendre quelque chose.
Meredith Roberts, 45 ans.
Le système de santé public a subi
une grosse panne informatique.
Beaucoup de fichiers ont été effacés.
Y compris toutes les victimes
que j'ai repérées.
<i>Et la vôtre aussi.</i>
<i>Une panne info n'aurait pas
effacé des données si clairement.</i>
C'est délibéré. Je vais voir ça.
<i>Et la famille ?</i>
<i>Ça s'arrange.</i>
- Ils te passent le bonjour.
- Moi de même.
Alors, le Club des Survivants
à la Fin du Monde.
Je suis vraiment contente de te voir.
Ah, tu as vraiment fait
tout ce chemin pour me voir.
C'est ma mâchoire. On la voit une fois,
on la veut pour toujours.
Il te manque ?
Non. J'ai fait mon choix.
Peut-être par moments.
Un tout petit peu.
Et puis je me reprends.
J'ai bien assez pour m'occuper.
Oh, oui, petite prétentieuse.
Officier médical, c'est ça ?
Oui.
- Donc je dois t'appeler chef ?
- Non.
Suis juste mes ordres à la lettre.
Tu aurais dû m'appeler
si tu cherchais du travail.
C'était pas le cas.
Cette femme d'UNIT est
sortie de nulle part,
disant que j'étais ce qui leur fallait,
et qu'une source irréprochable
m'avait hautement recommandée.
- Tu veux dire... ?
- Qui d'autre ?
Il a dû se dire qu'il t'en devait une.
Comme nous tous.
Tu pourrais m'avoir un de ces
bonnets rouges, pour usage privé ?
Je pense que ça irait bien à Ianto.
Tu veux un uniforme, crées-en un.
Aurais-je le droit à une visite guidée ?
Oui, chef. Tout ce
que vous voudrez, chef.
Arrête ça !
Voilà la serre.
La visite continue par ici, mesdames.
On ne flâne pas.
Alors, tu connais très bien Jack ?
On n'a été ensemble que quelques jours.
Mais c'était plutôt intense.
- Tu veux dire... ?
- Oh, non !
Non. Pas intense comme ça.
Pas du tout.
Pourquoi, vous êtes... ?
Non, pas du tout.
On doit être les deux seules
personnes sur cette planète.
Je sais.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas chez nous ?
Hé, on parle de moi ?
Non, on parlait de la
flore extra-terrestre.
Oui, c'est ça.
Elle est pas drôle.
Trouvez autre chose, les filles !
Vous avez des trucs super bizarres.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Fais attention.
C'est un artefact extra-terrestre.
Il provoque beaucoup de débats.
D'après moi, c'est un
instrument chirurgical.
<i>- Vraiment ?
- Ce n'est qu'une supposition.</i>
Typique d'un médecin.
Je l'ai appelé scalpel de singularité.
Il concentre son
énergie sur un point fixe
sans rien endommager sur son chemin.
- Superbe.
- C'est impressionnant.
Tu te rappelles la dernière fois
où tu as fait ça...?
Oui, c'est vrai.
Voilà ce qu'on va faire.
<i>Vaporiser ce papier</i>
sans même écorcher le verre.
Ça va mal finir.
D'accord.
Je ne maîtrise pas encore
bien le calibrage.
Jack.
Il y a eu une nouvelle attaque.
Avec aiguille hypodermique.
<i>Mais cette fois, la victime a survécu.</i>
<i>Une femme de 27 ans.</i>
Elle est à l'hôpital.
<i>Dossier médical effacé,
comme les autres.</i>
Les médecins m'ont dit
qu'ils avaient fini.
Nous sommes un peu différents.
Nous savons que c'est dur, Mary.
Mais avez-vous reconnu
votre agresseur ?
- J'ai déjà parlé à la police.
- Nous sommes aussi différents d'eux.
Non, je ne l'avais jamais vu.
A-t-il dit quelque
chose durant l'attaque ?
- Non.
- Ouvrez grand.
Il est juste venu vers moi avec
cette énorme aiguille.
Mon chien l'a mordu et je lui ai
donné un coup aux testicules.
Respect !
C'est un trois quatre.
Alors, toi et Jack, ça remonte à loin ?
Ça remonte vraiment, oui.
Comment vous vous êtes connus ?
Disons qu'on voyait le même docteur.
Ces meurtres...
Pourquoi de l'ammonium ?
C'est une drôle manière de tuer.
<i>C'est grossier.</i>
C'est comme leur injecter de la Javel.
A moins que le but ne soit pas
seulement de tuer.
Mais de détruire quelque chose
dans leur sang.
Se débarrasser d'une preuve.
Localement, on a une victime
de meurtre et une survivante.
Attaques avec aiguille,
dossiers médicaux effacés.
Et davantage dans tout le Royaume-Uni.
<i>On pense que leur but est de</i>
détruire les preuves de leur
conditions médicales.
Gwen, Ianto,
continuez l'enquête criminelle.
D'accord.
Martha, Owen, continuez du côté médical.
Tosh, tu as récupéré les dossiers ?
Pas encore.
Je vais devoir percer loin dans
le système mémoire,
voir si je trouve des traces de
dossiers effacés ou temporaires.
Totalement illégalement, bien sûr.
Fais ce que tu as à faire.
Il ne s'agit pas d'un maniaque
obsédé par les aiguilles.
C'est une conspiration.
Ianto, la police a trouvé un
nouveau corps dans Heath Park.
Il a toutes les marques
des autres attaques.
Je préviens Gwen.
Je suis en route.
Qu'est-ce qu'on a ?
Le corps a été retrouvé tôt ce matin.
- Homme caucasien, environ 20 ans.
- Merci.
- Qui est-ce ?
- Barry Leonard. Etudiant.
- Le médecin pense à un...
- Choc toxique.
L'attaque a eu lieu dans les bois.
Aucun témoin, aucune caméra.
Comme les autres.
Tosh vient de vérifier son
dossier médical. Déjà effacé.
La marque de ponction dans
son œil est identique aux autres.
Jack a raison.
Ces attaques ne sont pas aléatoires.
Elles sont cliniques, professionnelles.
Ça ressemble plus à des assassinats.
Sauf que Barry Leonard était étudiant.
Qui assassinerait un étudiant ?
Une banque de prêt étudiant.
Oui, tu viens d'élucider le mystère.
Pourquoi effacer les dossiers médicaux ?
Qu'ont-ils tous en commun ?
Owen est en train
d'analyser les résultats de Mary.
J'espère qu'on trouvera quelque chose.
En attendant, on est dans le flou.
On a aucune idée de la prochaine cible
et les attaques sont de
plus en plus fréquentes.
Continuons à chercher.
On trouvera quelque chose.
<i>Martha, un appel de l'hôpital.</i>
<i>Mary a fait une sorte de crise.</i>
On doit aller à l'hôpital.
Mary s'est évanouie.
Je parie sur ce truc.
Ça vient du sang de Mary.
Je n'ai encore jamais vu ça.
Moi non plus.
Tu as fait une analyse des isoenzymes ?
Pas encore. A quoi tu penses ?
- Infection parasitaire ?
- Peut-être.
Ça vient forcément de ce truc.
Sinon, je n'ai aucune idée
de ce qui cloche chez elle.
Aucune infection,
pas de défaillance des organes.
Niveau de cholestérol et
pression sanguine parfaits.
Exactement.
Elle est tellement normale
qu'elle est anormale.
Mary, vous m'entendez ?
Oui.
Quelque chose dans votre sang
nous est inconnu.
On pense que c'est la
cause de votre état.
On doit savoir ce qui vous arrive
pour pouvoir vous aider.
Vous êtes les docteurs.
A vous de me le dire.
<i>Barry était mon meilleur pote.</i>
On suivait les mêmes cours.
Je l'ai rencontré le premier jour.
Barry consommait-il de la drogue ?
Avant, il était toujours clean.
Il devait faire attention
à ce qu'il ingurgitait.
A cause de son diabète.
- Barry était diabétique ?
- Oui.
Une fois guéri, il buvait,
prenait de la coke.
Barry a été guéri du diabète ?
- Oui.
- C'est impossible.
Il ne prenait plus d'insuline.
Il allait bien.
Owen, j'ai une info.
Qui est à l'origine de cette guérison ?
Je ne sais pas.
Il n'en parlait pas.
Je sais juste qu'il s'est mis
à faire n'importe quoi.
Barry Leonard aurait été
guéri du diabète.
Merci, Ianto.
Ecoutez Mary, vous
allez devoir coopérer.
Ça pourrait vous coûter la vie.
Avez-vous déjà eu une grave maladie ?
C'était trop beau pour être vrai.
Comment ça ?
J'étais séropositive.
Vous n'avez aucun anticorps.
C'est médicalement impossible.
C'est le Reset.
Le Reset c'est quoi, une drogue ?
Ça ne me dit rien.
Une idée de son nom chimique ?
Où l'avez-vous obtenu, Mary ?
- Je l'ai eu à la PHARM.
- La farme ?
P-H-A-R-M, la Pharm.
Un centre de recherche médicale.
- Comment l'avez-vous obtenu ?
- Ils me l'ont donné.
Ils m'ont payé cher.
Ils m'ont dit de ne pas en parler
car ça faisait partie du contrat.
Vous étiez un sujet
d'expérimentation médicale ?
Elle convulse.
- Je lui donne encore 10 ml.
- Ça va.
Elle est morte.
Urgence !
Sortez-nous de là !
<i>C'est une larve extra-terrestre,
qui incube dans le corps humain.</i>
On n'a jamais rien vu de tel.
Elles ont quitté le corps de Mary
quand elle est morte.
Elles cherchaient un autre hôte
pour continuer à se développer.
Ça aurait pu être nous.
Heureusement, n'en trouvant pas
assez rapidement, elles sont mortes.
Je me demande en quoi cette
mignonne petite larve se transforme.
Voilà un modèle moléculaire de la
drogue trouvée dans le sang de Mary.
- Elle l'a appelée Reset.
- Qu'est-ce qu'elle fait ?
C'est comme un antivirus
sur ton ordinateur.
Le logiciel parcours les fichiers
<i>et lorsqu’il trouve un virus quelconque,</i>
<i>il l'identifie et le détruit.</i>
C'est ce que cette drogue fait
au corps humain.
Mais pas seulement aux virus.
<i>Aussi aux bactéries, toxines,
même aux cellules mutantes, tout.</i>
Le corps revient à ses
paramètres de départ.
<i>C'est la toute dernière formule magique.</i>
Elle supplante toute
l'armure pharmacologique.
Ça serait la plus grande découverte
médicale de l'histoire.
Exactement.
Sauf qu'elle est couplée avec
un parasite extra-terrestre mortel.
Pas une si grande découverte.
Le parasite a besoin d'un corps
humain durant son incubation.
L'œuf du parasite s'incorpore
à la formule magique
qui réinitialise tous les paramètres.
Reset, remise à zéro.
Super.
Qui dirige la Pharm ?
Son image publique est normale.
<i>C'est un partenariat entre</i>
le gouvernement et un consortium
d'entreprises pharmaceutiques.
Ils recherchent et développent
la biotechnologie à la pointe.
<i>Leur système informatique est bien
plus à la pointe que nécessaire.</i>
Et ils ont l'air d'avoir un
accès illimité au niveau sécurité.
Ils peuvent donc effacer
des dossiers médicaux.
Tout à fait.
Qui dirige tout ça ?
Le directeur de l'institut est
le Dr Aaron Copley.
<i>Je connais ses travaux.</i>
Un des chercheurs scientifiques
les plus respectés dans son domaine.
Diplômé d'Harvard.
A mené des recherches à Cambridge.
<i>Son dernier emploi, Professeur de
Pharmacologie Moléculaire à Harvard.</i>
Il est venu au Royaume-Uni
pour lancer la Pharm.
Et il est plutôt pas mal.
Notre visite lui plaira ?
Torchwood.
Vous vous êtes déplacés en vain,
M. Harker.
Harkness. Et c'est Capitaine,
mais vous pouvez m'appeler Jack.
Capitaine ?
Où avez-vous amarré votre bateau ?
J'aime les hommes qui ont
le sens de l'humour.
Vous connaissez de bonnes blagues
sur les procès médicaux ?
Eh bien, Jack,
tous ces gens ne me disent rien.
En tant que directeur de l'institut,
je les aurais rencontrés personnellement
s'ils avaient été de nos sujets.
- Dr Copley.
- C'est Professeur, en fait.
Mais je peux vous appeler Aaron.
C'est un peu gênant.
Deux de ces personnes ont été tuées.
La dernière est morte d'une infection
parasitaire d'origine extra-terrestre.
L'une de ces victimes a mentionné
le nom de votre organisation
peu avant de mourir.
D'origine extra-terrestre ?
- C'est absurde.
- Professeur.
Lorsque que j'écrivais ma thèse,
vos travaux sur l'immunologie
m'ont été très utiles, merci.
Content de rendre service.
Si un médicament pouvait
ramener le corps humain
à ses paramètres
d'origine, vous le sauriez.
<i>En effet.</i>
Mais il n'existe rien de la sorte.
Un de mes petits amis avait les
narines dilatées quand il mentait.
J'ai déjà du retard pour
mon rendez-vous suivant.
Allez-y. On va jeter un œil.
Nos locaux de recherche sont classifiés.
Nous ne pouvons vous laisser y accéder.
Mais vous pourrez jouir de
notre visite guidée.
Normalement, Aaron,
nous allons où nous voulons.
Pas ici.
Demandez à Whitehall.
Nous sommes protégés.
J'ai récemment eu une mauvaise
expérience avec un politicien.
J'ai tendance à ne
plus écouter Whitehall.
Laissez-moi appeler quelqu'un
pour vous guider jusqu'à la sortie.
C'est moi, ou il était
un peu susceptible ?
Tant pis pour l'approche polie.
Il faut qu'on retourne cet endroit.
Oh, oui.
Car cet endroit a la plus grande
concentration de forme de vie alien
de ce côté de la Brèche.
Le gris ne lui va vraiment pas.
Je n'arrive pas à pénétrer leur système.
Si je continue aussi brutalement,
ils sauront qu'on les attaque.
Une forme de vie extra-terrestre
s'intègre au sang humain.
Je dois y entrer.
Tosh, j'ai les résultats.
Sur ton écran.
Ianto, c'est génial !
Ils recherchent des volontaires.
C'est compréhensible,
vu leur taux de perte.
L'un de nous y va sous couverture.
Non, on n'en sait pas assez.
Trop de choses pourraient mal tourner.
<i>A moins d'envoyer un médecin.</i>
Quelqu'un qui saurait quoi chercher.
Oui, mais je ne peux pas le faire.
Ils me connaissent.
Je sais que c'est dur à croire, Owen,
mais je ne pensais pas à toi.
Hors de question.
Allez, Jack.
J'ai connu pire, et tu le sais.
D'accord.
Jack, je peux te parler ?
Je sais que vous vous connaissez
depuis longtemps.
Mais tu ne peux pas l'envoyer
là-bas comme ça.
Fais-moi confiance.
Elle en est largement capable.
Je lui ferais confiance
si la fin du monde arrivait.
En réalité, je l'ai fait.
Voilà les plans des bâtiments.
D'après ce qu'Owen et Jack ont vu,
le bâtiment principal contient
le bureau de Copley
des salles de recherche médicale
et les chambres des
sujets expérimentaux.
Et les bâtiments du fond ?
Zone interdite, entourée de grillages,
gardes armés.
Jack pense que les signaux
extra-terrestres viennent de là.
Cool.
Mais tu n'as pas à t'en approcher.
Rabat-joie.
Première étape,
être admise en tant que
sujet expérimental.
N'exagère pas, n'attire
pas l'attention sur toi.
Etre invisible. Je sais faire ça.
Une fois réussi, tu dois accéder
au système informatique.
Désactiver les pare-feu et
les protocoles de sécurité.
Tosh pourra accéder aux fichiers
et voir ce qu'ils fabriquent.
Espionnage industriel.
Très civilisé.
Une fois fini, tu t'en vas.
Ne prends aucun risque.
C'est compris.
Bien.
Jack m'a demandé
un bonnet de UNIT pour toi.
Ah bon ?
Le rouge me va bien, c'est vrai.
Donc j'ai raison de penser que vous... ?
On...
s'amuse.
Ah oui ?
Oui.
Alors, c'est comment ?
Innovant.
Vraiment ?
A la limite de l'avant-gardisme.
Oh, oui.
Alors, on s'occupe de ta couverture ?
Tout à fait.
Fausse carte d'identité.
Prénom : Samantha.
Je me suis dit que le Jones passerait.
Comment communique-t'on ?
<i>C'est très compliqué.</i>
L'endroit pourrait être sur écoute.
Il ne faut pas qu'on
t'entende nous parler.
Mais je veux avoir un
œil sur toi à tout moment.
Alors ?
Je n'ai pas besoin de lentilles.
<i>De celles-ci, si.</i>
Je suis une caméra !
C'est ce que Chris Isherwood* m'a dit
en parcourant le Kurfurstendamm.*
<i>Et on peut...</i>
<i>t'envoyer des messages.</i>
Elles marchent seulement portées,
grâce à la chaleur humaine.
Tu dois donc les porter tout le temps.
Je ferais donc certaines choses
les yeux fermés.
En cas d'urgence,
on peut directement te parler.
<i>Les lentilles communiqueront avec
tes neuraux-récepteurs sensoriels</i>
créant un tunnel vers
le système auditif.
Ces signaux peuvent être interceptés ?
Technologie alien, qui exploite
une solution au paradoxe d'EPR.
Oh, l'intrication quantique de
particules isolées. Cool.
Je vous ai dit qu'elle était géniale ?
Deux prises de sang,
c'est la procédure standard.
L'une sera analysée cette nuit.
Merci, infirmière.
<i>Dites-moi où vous avez voyagé, Samantha.</i>
J'ai passé de bons moments
aux Etats-Unis.
En France, en Allemagne, en Australie.
<i>Et le Tiers-Monde ?</i>
<i>Afrique, Amérique Latine ?</i>
Non, mais je finirai bien par y aller.
<i>Beaucoup de voyages
pourraient être un problème.</i>
<i>Si vous avez eu des maladies tropicales,</i>
il pourrait y avoir
des effets secondaires.
Et la santé de nos volontaires
est notre priorité absolue.
Il n'y aura pas de problèmes.
Je suis très pointue niveau santé.
Ma mère est infirmière.
Voici le professeur Copley, Samantha.
Directeur de l'institut.
<i>Bonjour, Sam. Enchanté.</i>
Dis-lui de se rapprocher de lui.
Je vois que vous êtes étudiante.
- En effet.
- Dans quel domaine ?
Ecriture créative.
J'ai vraiment besoin de l'argent.
<i>Vous comprendrez, j'en suis sûr,</i>
<i>que nous avons beaucoup de demandes.</i>
Dis-lui de ne pas le perdre.
Nous vous feront parvenir notre réponse.
J'aurais dû vous dire une chose.
Oui ?
Vous le verrez avec la prise de sang.
<i>J'ai eu une infection hépatique.</i>
Elle ment.
C'est sa porte d'entrée.
Je vais bien, maintenant.
Mais ça reste dans le sang.
<i>A strictement parler, c'est incurable.</i>
Ça met les choses en perspective.
Un sujet hépatique nous intéresserait.
Vous pouvez commencer tout de suite ?
Bien sûr.
J'ai amené mes affaires.
Vous devez juste signer cet
accord de confidentialité.
Elle est rentrée.
Pour citer à nouveau Chris Isherwood,
l'important n'est pas
l'entrée, mais la sortie.
Merci.
Quel genre de médicaments
allez-vous me donner ?
Nous avons différents produits
au niveau expérimental.
Nous vous expliquerons tout
une fois le programme mis en place.
Bien sûr, nous ne ferons rien
sans votre consentement.
Allez, Martha.
<i>Laisse la s'installer,
la nuit va être longue.</i>
Tu t'entends bien avec Martha.
Tu me connais. Toujours sociable.
- Elle est magnifique.
- Ah bon ?
Tu sais qu'elle l'est.
C'est pas faux.
Et médecin.
Accord parfait.
Seul le boulot l'intéresse.
Tu crois ?
Je flirte un peu pour lui montrer
les ficelles du métier.
Et si je tentais quoi que ce soit,
je crois que j'aurais Jack sur le dos.
Et ce...
tournoi de billard que
tu voulais organiser ?
Ça ?
Ça n'a jamais été un tournoi.
Alors c'était quoi ?
- C'était censé être un rendez-vous.
- Pardon ?
Je te proposais un rendez-vous !
Un rendez-vous ?
Tu n'avais pas compris ?
Toi et moi ?
Oui.
Je vois.
Et l'offre tient toujours ?
Oui.
D'accord.
Je me suis dit que si on passait
un peu de temps ensemble, une soirée...
D'accord.
Pardon ?
Faisons-le.
C'est du sarcasme ?
Non.
C'est de la politesse.
Tu me laisseras tomber.
Je viens de te dire oui.
Un rendez-vous, on voit où ça
nous mène, peut-être nulle part.
Ça marche. Un verre.
- D'accord.
- Oui.
Je continuerai à flirter avec les gens.
Je n'abandonne pas le flirt
à cause de ça.
Tu peux être le roi du flirt.
D'accord.
On devrait...
Se concentrer sur Martha.
Oui.
SOIS PRUDENTE.
Tosh, tu peux nous faire passer ça ?
Comme si c'était fait.
Il suffit qu'elle rapproche les
lentilles du champ EPR.
Tosh, tu peux l'aider à s'introduire
dans le système informatique ?
<i>Ça prendra du temps à expliquer.</i>
On a pas le temps.
Je veux qu'elle sorte de cette pièce.
Si je ne peux pas l'aider à me
donner le contrôle de l'ordinateur...
VA DANS LE RESEAU.
PORTS DU PARE-FEU.
CONNEXION PROXY.
J'ai le contrôle.
Le cycle de vie du parasite.
Ils l'appellent Mayfly.
<i>On n'a jamais vu d'espèce
comme celle-là.</i>
<i>C'est magnifique.</i>
C'est mortel.
Qu'est-ce que Copley en fait ?
Martha, maintenant qu'on a la main,
on peut tout faire d'ici.
Sors de là pronto.
Tu as le programme de décodage ?
Je te l'envoie.
Merci.
<i>Evasion en Zone A.</i>
<i>Tout le monde retourne
en Zone A immédiatement.</i>
<i>Que toutes les patrouilles
procèdent avec extrême prudence.</i>
<i>La créature évadée est très dangereuse.</i>
METS-TOI EN SURETE.
Jack ?
J'ai la liste des sujets expérimentaux.
Meredith Roberts, Mary Thomas,
Barry Leonard.
Toutes les victimes de meurtre.
Qui est BD ?
Actions exécutives ?
Ancienne terminologie de la CIA
pour assassinat.
<i>La Pharm a son propre tueur à gage.</i>
Plutôt inhabituel pour un centre
de recherche.
Il y a un nom qu'on ne connaît pas.
<i>Elin Morgan ?</i>
Elle n'a pas été déclarée
disparue ni morte.
Elle le sera bientôt.
Va la voir avec Ianto.
<i>N'essayez pas d'approcher la
créature. Compris ?</i>
<i>Sédatifs seulement. La créature
est extrêmement dangereuse.</i>
Compris. Allez, on y va !
Où va-t-elle ? Si la Pharm
a son propre tueur à gage,
qui sait ce dont ils sont capables.
Oui, et je l'ai envoyée là-bas.
Merde ! C'était quoi ?
Radiation en survolt ?
On l'a perdue !
La voilà !
Rassemblez les patrouilles.
Créature repérée.
Je ne peux pas la récupérer.
Il faut la sortir de là.
Cet endroit grouille de gardes.
Si on y va, on la mettra en danger !
On ne peut pas la laisser là-bas.
Si je ne la récupère pas dans 30 mn
on pensera à une alternative.
Il pourrait lui arriver n'importe quoi.
Martha sait se débrouiller.
Elle a vu pire que ça.
Tu en es sûr ?
C'est quoi ?
Le portable de Billy Davis.
Il sera chez Elin dans 3 mn.
Les mains en l'air ! Debout !
Jack, on a Billy Davis.
Il pourrait nous aider
à rentrer à la Pharm.
Dites à ce gorille de me relâcher !
Que se passe-t-il ?
Bon travail.
Je suis un patient volontaire.
Vous ne pouvez pas me traiter comme ça.
Vous nous avez menti, Samantha.
Laissez-moi m'expliquer.
Je m'ennuyais dans la chambre.
Je suis sortie un peu,
et cette chose m'a attaquée, puis
vos gardes m'ont agressée.
Vous ne devez rien à Torchwood.
Jack Harkness vous a traitée de
manière irresponsable.
Qui ? Je ne comprends vraiment pas !
C'est pas la peine.
Ce n'est pas un interrogatoire.
Torchwood ne signifie rien pour nous,
ils ne nous nuisent en rien.
Ils nous ont même rendu service
en vous amenant ici.
Nous avons analysé vos résultats.
Vous êtes vraiment spéciale.
J'ai vraiment mal au ventre,
je ne sais pas ce que c'est.
Mauvaise conscience, Billy.
Avouez tout.
Allez vous faire foutre.
D'accord, on va faire ça à la dure.
Doux Jésus, qu'est-ce que... ?
Ils ont tendance à exagérer.
Arrêtez ça ! Pitié !
Quelque chose à dire, Billy?
Oui, tout ce que vous voulez,
mais éloignez cette chose !
Eloignez ça !
D'accord. Tu t'es fait une petite
série de meurtres. Pourquoi ?
Je travaille pour la Pharm !
Ils ont donné le médicament
Reset à plusieurs personnes.
Mais il y a eu des effets secondaires.
Des parasites, je crois.
Ils allaient mourir de toute manière.
Je devais m'en débarrasser avant
que les symptômes n'apparaissent
au grand jour.
Vous savez ce que sont les
lymphocytes, Samantha ?
Une sorte de globules blancs,
partie du système immunitaire.
Vos lymphocytes sont
assez extraordinaires.
Nous n'en avons jamais vu de tels,
pas chez l'être humain.
C'est différent pour
les extra-terrestres.
Extra-terrestres ?
Je ne sais pas de quoi vous parlez.
Vos lymphocytes et sûrement
d'autres cellules ont muté.
Muté ? Comment ?
Sous l'influence de radiations.
Des radiations non-présentes dans
l'environnement temporel de la Terre.
Qu'est-ce que ça signifie ?
Nous avons déjà vu des extra-terrestres.
Mais jamais rien d'aussi
exotique que vous.
Un être humain qui a voyagé
dans le temps et l'espace.
Dites-moi tout.
Comment est-ce possible ?
Qu'avez-vous vu ?
C'est fou.
Je ne sais pas de quoi vous parlez.
Bien. Si vous voulez la jouer comme ça.
En tout cas, vous avez un système
immunitaire effectif unique
et c'est ce dont on a besoin.
<i>Nous développons un médicament
qui va changer le monde, Sam.</i>
Cancers incurables, SIDA.
Tous les fléaux de l'humanité, effacés.
Une révolution dans la médecine
et la sécurité sociale.
Sauf que c'est encore imparfait.
J'aimerais savoir ce que votre
système lymphatique fait
de ces imperfections.
Je ne prendrai pas ça !
Vous êtes volontaire.
On va à la Pharm, et vous allez
nous faire entrer.
Ouais, ouais, ouais.
Mon estomac !
- Owen, il nous le faut vivant !
- Je ne sais pas ce qu'il a !
- Fais quelque chose !
- On va essayer ça.
<i>Je crois que j'ai le bon calibrage.</i>
<i>Je vais le faire sortir.</i>
Owen, occupe-toi de ça.
Tu es sûr que tu avais
le bon calibrage ?
Je suis désolé.
Il a dû inspirer une larve quand
une de ses victimes est morte.
Ça aurait pu être moi, ou Martha.
Je lui ai donné deux
fois la dose critique.
Les larves de Mayfly incubent ?
Vous êtes sûr de vous ?
Son système immunitaire réagit.
Une bataille se livre à l'intérieur.
Restez calme.
On va entrer dans l'histoire.
Ianto, qu'as-tu fait du
corps de Billy Davis ?
J'allais juste m'en occuper. Pourquoi ?
Je crois que j'ai un moyen de
nous faire entrer à la Pharm.
Malin, non ?
Tu es complètement tordue.
Comment penses-tu
à des choses pareilles ?
Je le prends comme un compliment.
Tosh, Gwen, lanto, allez en Zone A.
Il faut trouver Martha.
Les mains en l'air !
Que lui avez-vous fait ?
Ne me dites pas que c'est Reset !
Elle a survécu au stage larval,
c'est une première.
Fascinant.
Il se trouve que ces insectes
pratiquent le cannibalisme.
Seuls les plus forts sont encore en vie.
Qui sait ce qui se passe ensuite ?
Arrêtez ça !
Je ne peux pas.
Je ne sais pas comment faire.
Mains en l'air !
Ianto.
Bon sang.
Jack, ce truc la tue !
Je ne sais pas quoi faire.
Owen, reste calme.
Il doit y avoir une solution.
Que se passe-t-il ?
C'est ce que fait la Pharm.
On cultive des extra-terrestres avec
des produits chimiques exotiques.
Qu'est-ce qu'un Weevil vous donne ?
<i>Des pesticides, et un défoliant
chimique assez puissant.</i>
<i>Mais ce ne sont pas les Weevils
qui nous décrocheront le prix Nobel.</i>
Mais les Mayflies, la base de Reset.
Avec du temps, on adaptera le
produit à l'humain,
et ce sera encore mieux
que la pénicilline.
Jack, rapport sur la Zone A.
Ils retiennent des douzaines de
créatures. Ils en font des cobayes.
Compris, lanto.
Dis à Tosh de lancer
l'extinction totale.
Cet endroit est une chambre de torture.
Je n'ai pas à débattre d'éthique
médicale avec vous.
Vous avez maltraité les Mayflies,
les transformant en parasites !
<i>Nous ne savions pas comment
ils se reproduisaient.</i>
Nous avons tenté de limiter les dégâts.
En tuant des gens ?
<i>Ils allaient mourir de toute manière.</i>
Nous sommes à l'aube de la plus
grande découverte de l'histoire.
Ça doit bien valoir quelques sacrifices.
Vous devez le comprendre, vous êtes
impliqué dans des recherches aliens.
Pas comme ça.
Je fais fermer cet endroit.
Dans vos rêves.
C'est un complexe officiel subventionné.
Je ne vais pas faire ça
en envoyant un mémo.
Nous contrôlons votre
système informatique.
Nous sommes en train d'effacer
votre base de données.
- C'est du cyber-terrorisme !
- Et ça n'est que le début.
Nous allons désactiver vos
systèmes de sécurité.
<i>Feu, radiations, et dangers biologiques.</i>
Le courant sera coupé,
les arroseurs mis en marche,
les locaux seront mis en
quarantaine et remplis de gaz inerte.
Les extra-terrestres mourront.
Ils meurent déjà.
Leurs souffrances seront abrégées.
Bon sang, on est du même côté !
Non.
Combattre des aliens hostiles est une
chose mais vous faites de l'esclavage,
de l'exploitation, un crime de guerre !
Jack, j'ai besoin de toi !
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
<i>C'est le seul moyen de la sauver.</i>
Je crois avoir compris
comment ça marche.
Tu ferais mieux d'être sûr car
ça n'a encore jamais marché.
<i>Owen, tu es sûr ?</i>
Recule Jack !
<i>Owen, dis-moi que tu es sûr !</i>
<i>Ce truc pourrait la tuer !</i>
<i>On la perd !</i>
<i>Qu'est-ce que tu as fait ?</i>
Ça a marché.
Merci mon Dieu.
Sortons-la d'ici.
Je vous recommande du repos, Madame.
Et quelques jours au lit, de
préférence sous ma tutelle.
Je sais pas comment te le
dire, mais j'ai un copain.
Il t'a sauvé la vie comme moi ?
En fait, oui.
Vas-y.
<i>Fermeture des bâtiments en cours.
Le personnel est prié d'évacuer.</i>
<i>Fermeture des bâtiments en cours.</i>
<i>Le personnel est prié d'évacuer.</i>
On y va !
Vous croyiez vraiment que
j'allais vous laisser partir ?
Vous avez détruit tout mon travail.
Ne faisons rien de stupide.
Nous sommes tous deux
rationnels, scientifiques.
Vous ne voulez pas faire ça.
A ton tour !
Tu m'entends, Owen ?
Tu dois le sauver !
Owen, reste avec moi.
Regarde-moi.
Regarde-moi bien.
Reste avec moi.
Allez mon grand.
Owen, parle-moi !
Il est mort.
Owen.
<i>Heure : 21h30.</i>
<i>Autopsie d'Owen Harper.</i>
<i>Officier de Torchwood numéro 565.</i>
<i>Age : 27 ans.</i>
<i>Début de l'autopsie.</i>
Le niveau d'énergie vient d'exploser.
Tu vois où il est ?
<i>Tu ne peux pas l'utiliser.</i>
Qui sait ce qui arrivera !
<i>J'espérais un miracle.</i>
<i>Où est-il passé ?</i>
- C'est ici.
- Martha !
<i>Ça doit être la mort,
car elle a volé ma vie.</i>

Torchwood. ..
..outside the
Government, beyond the police.
Fighting for the future on
behalf of the human race.
The 21st century is when everything
changes and Torchwood is ready.
The time is 2130.
This is Doctor Martha Jones.
Autopsy on Owen Harper, Caucasian, age 27.
Torchwood Officer 565.
Time of death witnessed at approximately 2030.
Autopsy begins.
STOP! Nobody touches him
til I get back, is that clear?
It's all right.
I've been looking forward
to seeing the Captain again.
Can you see where it is?
You'll owe me a favour.
Well?
- They hid it in a church?
- No.
When the people found out what it could
do, they built the church on top of it.
If I told you not to
use it, would you listen?
Shouldn't you know the answer to that?
I do. That's the problem.
Jack. . . ?
Jack, what have you got?
Oh, my God.
You can't use it. Not after Suzie.
I'm using the glove.
I'm bringing Owen back.
Are you really going to use that
after what happened last time?








OK, if you've got anything you need
to say to Owen, now's your chance.
Owen...
it's Jack, can you hear me?
Owen, hear my voice, get a hold of it,
let it draw you out, pull you out.
I'm not getting any vital signs.
Owen, it's me, Jack.
He's coming, he's coming!
Oh, my God!
What happened? Where am I?
Oh, God I'm shot, he shot me!
Owen, you need to listen to me,
we don't have long.
Where am I? This isn't the
hospital, this is the autopsy room.
What am I doing here? Jack, oh, no!
What's that? What's that?
The resurrection glove.
We lost you, but I brought you back.
How long have I got?
We're at thirty seconds and counting.
Oh, no. Jesus. Really?
OK, team, say your goodbyes. Gwen.
No offence, but I've only
got two minutes to live.
Tosh!
I'm gonna miss you.
And I love you.
I always have.
Owen, I need the code
for the alien morgue.
You're the only one who knows it.
You brought me back for that? For that?!
I'm sorry.
Jack, it's 231165. OK?
Sorry, and to help you prepare.
I know what death is.
I want you to be ready.
There's nothing. Just darkness.
Two minutes.
- Jack, Jack..
- Be brave.
Owen! Owen!
I'm really gonna need that hand back.
Owen?
Two minutes, twenty?
Look, I'm not using the glove.
But I'm still here.
Oh, here we go again.
Maybe I cheated it somehow.
Maybe I wasn't meant to
die so I'm being kept alive.
Ah, somebody pass me my pants, please.
It's OK. I hate to say
it, but you'll get used to it.
No heartbeat, there's no pulse.
Owen, you can't lead the investigation.
Why not?
Because you're the subject
of it, and because you're dead.
Are you sure about that?
Yes, I'm sure.
Well, I'm OK. Look, there's
electrical activity in my brain.
That shouldn't be possible.
Well, I'm still here
and I feel amazing!
So where's the power coming from?
Suzie survived because she
was draining energy from me.
Owen could be doing the same to Jack.
I feel fine.
The Philemon filter
detects biochemical energy.
It's how we knew Suzie
was draining Gwen.
And?
Nothing.
There's no connection between them.
It's not Jack.
I told you, I feel fine.
So what's keeping me ticking?
I mean, the energy in my brain must
be coming from somewhere.
This glove is different
to the other one.
Maybe different gloves
do different things?
- How many are there?
- Two.
Well, they tend to come in pairs.
We fished the first one out
of the harbour last year.
But where does it come from, originally?
Good question.
No idea. Tosh, do an analysis of the
glove, see you if you can find out.
Owen, I don't need to tell you
that you're under quarantine.
You don't, and yet you still do.
Oh, I woke you up, I'm sorry.
No, no, you didn't.
So, what's up?
You coming home soon, you know, tonight, next
week, in time for our wedding?
I was only teasing!
No, it's not that, it's not that.
What's happened? What's wrong?
Are you all right? Gwen?
A tough day, a tough day.
You're kinda cute when you frown.
The energy from the glove is spreading out
through your body, changing its composition.
If you keep this on we should be able
 to monitor changes as they happen.
You've stopped flirting with me.
I mean, it's all right.
I wouldn't flirt with me in
my condition either, but...
er, is it still necrophilia
if I'm conscious?
What was it like? To die?
- I don't think I should say.
- Why not?
I'm not sure the living should know...
The living....
It might change the
way you live your life.
You tell me right now, Owen.
It's hard to describe, there
aren't the words for it.
- It's like, er...
- What?
There was a light, a tiny speck of light.
And I was rushing towards it, like down a
corridor, then it glowed brighter and brighter...
..then suddenly there
were these gates...
These big pearly gates and there was this old
geezer and he said you've been a very naughty boy.
Idiot!
There was nothing, well, not
that I can remember.
Suzie said it was different.
What did she see?
She said there was
something beyond life,
something in the
darkness, something moving.
Martha!
Martha! Martha!
Martha!
Jack! Help! I need help! Now!
What's happening?
He just collapsed. Owen!
Owen, can you hear me?
- Calm down.
- What happened?
I was in the darkness, there was
something, something there...
What did you see?
I don't know.
It was waiting for me.
This way.
Owen's body's undergoing
some kind of transformation.
His cells aren't
decaying, they're changing.
Into what?
An energy I can't identify.
But it's growing, all the time.
He's about 40% something else.
I don't feel any different.
We need to find out where
this energy's coming from.
Presumably it's the same
place as the glove, which,
judging from its atomic
makeup, isn't anywhere local.
Owen said he went
somewhere when he collapsed.
Could the energy and the glove
come from the same dark place?
Are we talking about another
dimension? Parallel universe?
Yes, guys, I'm still here.
Sorry.
OK, you said there was something
in the darkness, waiting for you.
I felt it, I didn't see it.
Where do you think you went?
Don't know.
So, what now?
Ianto, check our internal system readings for any
dimensional anomalies in the last twelve.
Owen, what I said before,
when I thought you were dying...
I'm not dying. I'm dead.
I'm a headless chicken. I just
haven't stopped running about yet.
Well, when I told you I...
Yeah, you didn't mean it. I know.
You do?
Yes, I mean, you didn't say anything before and
then suddenly I'm dying and it's like, "I love you."
That's not love, Tosh. That's grief.
You're losing something, so suddenly you
desperately desire it, textbook response.
Yeah, but Owen I... Don't go!
I'm just going to the toilet, all
right. For crying out loud!
'Melenkurion.
'Abatha.
'Duroc.
'Minas.
'Mill khabaal.'
Melenkurion abatha. ..
duroc minas mill khabaal!
Have you seen Owen?
He was with Toshiko.
The energy in him just
went off the scale.
Owen! Owen?
He said he needed the loo.
Owen's digestive system's shut down.
He can't eat or drink, so
he doesn't need to pee.
He's not answering.
Well, he's not in the hub.
You mean he's out there?
It's Owen, it's not like he's dangerous.
You sure about that?
Meaning?
You had the power to bring people back
to life and you never told UNIT. Why?
They would've wanted to use it.
I'm on your side, Jack, but Owen's just had a
surge of energy that we can't begin to understand.
The cells in his body are being
transformed into something else.
He's about 50% human.
And that 50% is dead.
We need to stop thinking
about him as Owen.
I'll find him.
Smile, it won't kill you.
You're gorgeous, you are.
- Don't you like me?
- Get off me.
No blood, brilliant.
What? Oi!
How did you find me?
Do you know what you've done?
You don't care about me.
You brought me back for an alarm code!
That is not why I brought you back.
Have you any idea what it means
to know that your life is over?
That that was it?!
That is Owen Harper's
contribution to the world.
You idiot!
GET OFF ME,
- GET OFF ME!
- Be careful with him!
Get off me you meat head, get off!
- That's enough.
- Let go of me!
Let's calm down, shall we?
Look, mate. I'm Torchwood.
Yeah, course you are, and I'm MI5.
I'm Owen Harper. I work for
Torchwood on special ops.
<Cockney accent>
Special ops? What's he on about?
Special needs more like it!
I warned that's enough!
You call that number, you
speak to Police Constable Gwen Cooper.
I want to make a complaint.
Enough. You're dead.
You break your ankle, what are the
chances it'll knit back together?
You want to add a wheelchair
to your prob. ..problems?
I forgot, my digestive system's shut down,
that alcohol I drank is just going to
sit in my stomach, it won't go anywhere.
Can you just stick your
fingers down your throat?
I'm dead, it's just another one of those
things, the gag reflex, I lost in the process.
Hang on, hang on, if I can just
line up my oesophagus. ..
That is the single most disgusting thing
I have ever seen, and I know disgusting.
Sorry, Jack, I forgot,
that goes on for a while after death.
For God's sake, let me out!
But eventually that will stop too.
I will fart my last fart.
God, I'm going to miss farting, and sex.
Sex more than farting, I hope.
Oh, you take these things for granted.
It's only when they're slipping away
that you realise how amazing they are.
This could be the last time I see these flecks
or you know, feel these bricks underneath my hands.
"Only in suffering do
we recognize beauty."
Yeah. Yeah, yeah! Who said that?
Proust.
You've read Proust?! Yeah!
Well, no.
We dated for a while.
He was really immature.
You know, none of us know whether to take
you seriously when you say those things.
When you've lived as long as I
have, you don't make any more up.
You've got forever, I could have seconds.
Hardly seems fair.
It isn't.
But then forever's overrated.
Not from where I'm sitting.
If you've got forever, you don't
notice the flecks on the concrete
or bother to touch the bricks.
And you send your friends into danger,
knowing the stakes
aren't the same for you,
that you might get them killed
while you walk away unscathed.
Then why did you bring me back? Guilt?
No, that's not why.
Then why did you, really?
Because I wasn't ready
to give up on you.
I guess I was hoping for a miracle.
And I still am.
Let's go home.
Torchwood. Authorization, Harkness, Jack.
474317.
Jack called in, he's found Owen.
They're OK, they're coming back.
Is he himself?
What do you mean, himself?
I wanted to know why Owen left.
Actually, more if he talked to anyone
about what I said, so I checked the CCTV.
That's a bit like stalking, Tosh!
I know!
Only now I wish I hadn't. Look.
Melekurion abatha, duroc minas mill khabaal.
Oh, my God.
What is that?
There's too many of them. They're after
me, I stole the glove from them. GO! GO!
Whoa! They must be really
pissed off with you.
Owen!
Stay here.
Owen!
- Owen, get behind me.
- Yeah, right.
Come on.
Owen, what the hell is going on?
Melekurion abatha!
Duroc minas mill khabaal!
I need to know what Owen was saying.
We all do.
This has never let us down before.
We should be able to play the translation
through the computer's speakers.
[BLEEPING]
It's never done that before.
I shall walk the earth and
my hunger will know no bounds.
I've got a really bad
feeling about this.
You don't know the half of it.
So I'm King of the Weevils,
maybe even Weevil Messiah,
but whichever way you
look at it, it ain't good.
No, it isn't, and I think
it's happened before.
Where did you get this?
I found it in an
article about Black Death
and what you're looking at there are the
first images of the Grim Reaper.
I shall walk the Earth and
my hunger will know no bounds.
In legend, the person who said
those words was Death himself.
[LOW HOWLING]
But there's no such thing.
Yeah, I'm dead. I'm not Death.
There is a difference.
Does he know that?
Right, that wood-carving dates back to the
15th century, to a small parish called St. James.
When they heard about the plague, they
built a wall around the town.
Unfortunately, that didn't
prevent a little girl from dying.
S0 the legend goes, the
priest performs a miracle,
brings her back to life, but
she doesn't come back alone,
she brought Death with
her, and he walked amongst them.
Are we seriously gonna act
on something she's Googled?
What was the name of the priest's church?
Yep, St Mary's.
That's where I found the glove, which
makes the parish of St. James. ..
...the town that 500 years later
would turn into a city called Cardiff.
What happened to the town
when Death walked amongst them?
People died.
12 people.
Death needed 13 souls before it
had a permanent hold on the Earth.
How did they stop it at 12?
It just says faith.
Owen is changing.
Who knows what that energy is?
What if it's making
him a host, a gateway?
I've been thinking there's something in the
darkness, waiting for me to finally pass over,
but I've got it wrong, OK, it's
the other way around.
It's trying to get here through me.
[BLEEPING]
What's this reading now?
80%.
What happens when it completes?
We fight monsters, what happens when we
turn out to be the monsters, when I do?
Even if we have to fight
you, you're already dead.
What do we do with the dead?
Come on, what do we do?
You embalm them.
If we inject a formaldehyde
solution into my veins,
it'll petrify my neural
pathways and freeze dry my brain.
It's the only way to be sure.
Are you sure about this?
The formaldehyde might irritate, but the
ethanol should prevent me feeling its effect.
It's a raging carcinogen, but I don't
think I need to worry about that.
You know what I mean.
Yeah.
I can't sleep, I can't
drink and I can't shag,
and they are three of
my favourite things.
Owen!
I'm not the same, Gwen.
I came back different, hollow...
..like I'm missing something...
..and I do not want to be like this, OK?
I'm ready.
Owen's at 95%.
Then let's not waste any more time.
No goodbyes.
Are you ready for the first injection?
Someone really doesn't like needles.
Lockdown!
Martha just. ..
Owen, Owen, don't move.
Everyone spread out.
Where'd it go?
I think it went under the cabinet.
Are you all right?
- Yeah, I think so.
- Good.
It's there.
Gun!
If you destroy it, the
connection can be lost.
Now!
Oh, my God.
Martha?
Martha?
What's happened to her?
It's the Glove.
It did this to her.
Owen, help me with her.
[BLEEPING]
Owen!
I will walk the Earth
and my hunger will know no bounds.
Police Officer, I need a medic now!
Where did it go? Owen!
So what happened to that thing?
- It's gone.
- So it's out there?
How do you know her?
I take it you're not family.
She's a neighbour, we look in, do her
shopping, collect her pension, that sort of thing.
Her red blood cell count is through the
floor and she's massively dehydrated.
All of which has placed a
considerable strain on her heart.
- You've got to help her.
- We are,
but you have to accept she's, what, 80?
just do what you can, please.
It must be Death, because
it's stolen my life.
We'll find a way to reverse this.
Last time, back when Cardiff
was a town, it killed 12 people.
So?
Why didn't it get to 13? And where
does this faith bit come into it?
- Ianto, we need answers.
- I'm on it.
Owen, I want you back at
the hub. You're not safe.
Jack, I'm free of it, I promise
you, and I'm useful , I'm useful here.
When it came though me, I felt it.
I know what it is, I know
what it wants, it's Duroc.
- And what is that?
- Hunger.
Where do we look for it it? Where
do we even start to look for it?
We won't have to go far. It's here.
Why would it follow us here?
I'm not sure it did.
Maybe it senses the near-dead.
If you were death, wouldn't
you target a hospital?
This is Captain Jack Harkness, Torchwood.
You need to evacuate St.
Helen's Hospital Cardiff immediately.
Ladies and Gentlemen, if you can move as quickly
as possible to your nearest exit, thank you.
Can I have a hand in
here, please? All right, wake up!
Dressing gowns on!
It's not a drill. Can you
listen to me carefully, please?
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is not a drill.
Please make your way to the
assembly point in car park one.
Ianto, I need you to crack into
the hospital communication system.
Already done it. They've got multiple
code fours in intensive care.
- Which floor is that?
- Sixth.
- What's a Code Four?
- Heart attack.
We need to do a body count, let
me know if we get to 12.
- Have you seen Jamie?
- No.
I'll catch you up.
Jamie?
Jamie, is that you under there?
Owen, Tosh, we're on the sixth floor.
There's fatalities. Seven of them.
I'm hearing of a fatality
during a routine operation.
Let's count that as eight.
That leaves five to go. Oh.
- What?
- There's five of us.
If it was last seen on the sixth, did
it go up or down from there?
Most of the top floors are evacuated, so
if it's still hungry, I'd guess...
We'll make our way down.
Jack, we still have no idea
what to do if we find it.
Ianto?
I have searched for the phrase "I shall walk
the Earth and my hunger will know bounds",
but I keep getting
redirected to Weight Watchers!
It was a medical journal,
History Of Medicine.
Try under Tavistock or Wellcome.
We're on the seventh floor.
It's here, I can feel it.
Owen, you're scaring me.
I'm not exactly reassuring myself.
Come on.
Take my hand. Come on!
- I'm getting reports of 12 people dead.
- So?
The legend says, when Death took 13
souls, its power would be unstoppable.
It'd roam the earth forever, Jack.
It only needs to kill once more.
That's 12. We're running out of time.
I think we lost it.
Maybe not.
If I can access the correct frequency...
- What's your name?
- Jamie Burton.
All right, Jamie. I'm Owen, this is Toshiko,
we're going to get you out of here.
- What are you in here for?
- Leukaemia.
Jamie, you're going to be fine.
I'll have this door open in a second.
Jamie, they got you in for
a round of chemo, have they?
Had that. It didn't work.
So why are you here?
They're trying to make me have it again.
It didn't work though.
The cancer just comes back,
just makes my hair fall out.
I'm gonna die. I might as
well do it with eyebrows.
Ianto, what have we got?
Back in 1479, the priest discovered that Death
needed 13 souls to walk the earth for eternity.
He stopped Death at 12...
- It was Faith.
- I know!
No, the little girl that died and was brought
back to life. Her name was Faith.
- She stopped it.
- Well, how?
It doesn't say.
Faith didn't have anything to lose.
She was already dead.
Jamie.
Jamie, you're scared - of course you are.
The last lot of chemo didn't work and you can't bear
 the thought of going through all that pain again,
and I understand that, mate, I really do,
but let me tell you that not
everyone dies of this disease
and the ones with the best chance of making it
are the ones who believe that they can beat Death.
And sometimes, just sometimes, you can.
So watch and learn, Jamie Burton.
Watch what?
Watch me beat Death.
- Come on!
- OK, go!
Come on, Jamie. Take him. OK.
Owen, I am not leaving you to
face that thing on your own.
I know what to do.
You don't know what we're dealing with.
You're so gonna hate me for this.
Owen! Owen, no! Open the door!
What the hell are you doing?!
Owen, Owen!
How long?!
How long can you last
here with only 12 victims?
There's nothing here for you!
Owen Harper's soul
has left the building!
There's nobody here but us dead men.
- No!! Owen!
- Owen!
What else have you got?
What else can you do to the dead?!
Jack! Jack! Jack!
Owen! Owen!
Owen!
Is that all you've got?!
- Finish!
- Owen!
No, no, no.
Jack?
Jack?
Gwen?
Anyone?
So tell me, Doctor, is it
worth starting War And Peace?
I'm sorry that you got hurt.
That I got you hurt.
It's not me that I'm worried about.
You soaked up a colossal amount
of energy, but it's dissipating now.
It doesn't sound good.
I don't know anything about
its properties. None of us do.
It could take 30 years for
it to die out completely.
Or 30 minutes.
Jack.
People died because you brought me back.
We owe them, you and me.
I'm still a doctor.
Let's put me to work.
See if we can't even that score.
We'll see.
Did he really beat death?
You can never really beat
death, never escape it.
It's always in the shadows, waiting.
So what do we do now?

Torchwood Officer 565, I'm
relieving you of your position.
What's wrong with you?!
'Three days ago, I died.'
- I'm broken, Tosh!
'And they think I'm fine.'
What the hell are you?
'But they're wrong.'
Parker's house. There's an
energy spike coming from there.
And they're getting bigger.
We need to get in there.
But then there's these.
Heat sensors.
How do we get past them?
I'm literally too cool for school.
You're Torchwood, yeah?
And I'm having one hell of a day.
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
Torchwood.
Au delà du gouvernement et de la police.
Ils se battent pour
le futur de l'humanité.
C'est au 21ème siècle que tout
bascule. Et Torchwood est prêt.
Il est
21h30.
Je suis le Docteur Martha Jones.
Autopsie sur Owen Harper.
Homme blanc, 27 ans.
Officier de Torchwood numéro 565.
Heure du décès enregistrée à 20h30.
Début de l'autopsie.
Arrêtez ! Personne ne le touche
jusqu'à mon retour, compris ?
C'est bon.
J'avais hâte de revoir le Capitaine.
Tu vois où il est ?
Tu m'en devras une.
Alors ?
- Ils l'ont caché dans une église ?
- Non.
Quand les gens ont vu ce qu'il faisait,
ils ont construit l'église dessus.
Si je te disais de ne pas
l'utiliser, tu m'écouterais ?
Tu ne connais pas la réponse ?
Si. C'est le problème.
Jack, qu'est-ce que tu ramènes ?
Oh mon dieu.
Tu ne peux pas faire ça.
Pas après Suzie.
Je vais me servir du gant.
Je ramène Owen.

Tu vas vraiment t'en servir
après la dernière fois ?
Jack, les gants sont dangereux.
Au mieux, ça nous donnera deux minutes.
Au pire... Qui sait ce qui arrivera ?
Ça n'est pas sujet à débat.
Je croyais que le gant
ne marchait pas avec toi.
Différent gant,
différentes circonstances.
Cette fois, ça doit marcher.
Je ne lui laisserai pas le choix.
Si vous avez quelque chose à dire
à Owen, c'est maintenant ou jamais.
C'est Jack, tu m'entends ?
Owen, écoute ma voix.
Accroche-toi à elle.
Laisse-la te tirer de là.
Aucuns signes vitaux.
Owen, c'est moi, Jack.
Il arrive !   Il arrive
Oh mon dieu !
Que se passe-t-il ? Où suis-je ?
Il m'a tiré dessus !
Owen, écoute-moi, on a peu de temps.
Où suis-je ? C'est pas l'hôpital,
c'est la salle d'autopsie.
Qu'est-ce que je fais là ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Le gant de résurrection.
On t'a perdu, mais je t'ai ramené.
J'ai combien de temps ?
On en est à 30 secondes.
Oh non. C'est pas vrai.
Allez tout le monde, faites vos adieux.
Le prends pas mal mais j'ai
plus que 2 minutes à vivre.
Tu vas me manquer.
Et je t'aime.
Je t'ai toujours aimé.
Owen, il me faut le
code de la morgue alien.
Tu es le seul à le connaître.
Tu m'as ramené pour ça ? Pour ça !
Désolé.
C'est 231165. OK ?
Désolé, et pour te préparer...
Je connais la mort.
Je veux que tu sois prêt.
Il n'y a rien. Juste les ténèbres.
Deux minutes.
- Jack...
- Sois courageux.
Owen !
Owen !
Je vais avoir besoin de cette main.
Owen ?
2 minutes et 20 secondes.
Je n'utilise pas le gant.
Mais je suis toujours là.
Et c'est reparti.
J'ai dû tromper la mort.
Je ne devais peut-être pas
mourir donc on me garde en vie.
Que quelqu'un me passe mon
pantalon, s'il vous plaît.
Ça va aller. Je déteste dire
ça, mais tu vas t'y habituer.
Pas de battements de coeur,
pas de pouls.
Owen, tu ne peux pas t'examiner.
Pourquoi pas ?
Parce que tu en es le sujet,
et que tu es mort.
Tu en es sûre ?
Oui.
Eh bien, ça va. Mon cerveau
produit une activité électrique.
Il ne devrait pas.
Je suis toujours là et
je me sens super bien !
Alors d'où vient ton énergie ?
Suzie a survécu car elle
me drainait de l'énergie.
Owen fait peut-être
la même chose à Jack.
Je me sens bien.
Le filtre Philémone détecte
l'énergie biochimique.
C'est comme ça qu'on a su pour Suzie.
Et ?
Rien.
Aucune connexion entre eux.
C'est pas Jack.
Je vous l'avais dit, je vais bien.
Qu'est-ce qui me garde en vie ?
L'énergie dans mon cerveau
doit bien venir de quelque part.
Ce gant est différent de l'autre.
Peut-être qu'un gant différent
fait des choses différentes.
Il y en a combien ?
deux
Ils ont tendance à aller par paire.
On a repêché le premier
au port l'an dernier.
Mais d'où vient-il, à la base ?
Bonne question.
Aucune idée. Tosh, fais une analyse
du gant. Vois ce que tu peux trouver.
Owen, nul besoin de préciser
que tu es sous quarantaine.
Non, mais tu le fais quand même.
Oh, je t'ai réveillé, désolée.
Non, pas du tout.
<i>Quoi de neuf ?</i>
Tu rentres bientôt ? Ce soir, la semaine
prochaine, à temps pour le mariage ?
Je te taquinais !
Non, c'est pas ça.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
<i>Ça va ? Gwen ?</i>
Dure journée.
Tu es mignonne quand
tu fronces les sourcils.
L'énergie du gant se répand à travers
ton corps et change sa constitution.
Si tu portes ça, on devrait pouvoir
renseigner chaque changement.
Tu ne flirtes plus avec moi.
Enfin, c'est pas grave.
Je ne flirterais pas avec moi non
plus dans ma condition, mais...
C'est toujours de la nécrophilie
si je suis conscient ?
C'était comment ?    De mourir ?
- Je ne sais pas si je devrais le dire.
- Pourquoi pas ?
Je ne sais pas si les vivants
devraient savoir. Les vivants...
Ça pourrait changer la façon
dont vous vivez votre vie.
Dis-moi, Owen.
C'est dur à décrire.
Il n'y a pas de mots pour ça.
- C'est comme...
- Quoi ?
Il y avait une lumière,
un petit spectre de lumière.
Je courais vers le fond du couloir,
elle brillait de plus en plus
Tout à coup j'ai vu ces portes...
Enormes et nacrées, et un vieil aigri
m'a dit : "Tu as été un vilain garçon".
Crétin !
Il n'y avait rien.
Rien dont je me souvienne.
Suzie disait que c'était différent.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle a dit ?
Qu'il y avait quelque chose
au-delà de la vie.
Quelque chose dans les ténèbres,
quelque chose qui bougeait.
Martha !
Martha !
Jack ! A l'aide !
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Il s'est évanoui.
Owen ! Tu m'entends ?
- Calme-toi.
- Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
J'étais dans les ténèbres,
il y avait quelque chose.
Qu'as-tu vu ?
Je ne sais pas.
Quelque chose m'attendait.
Viens là.
Le corps d'Owen subit
des transformations.
Ses cellules ne se décomposent pas,
elles mutent.
En quoi ?
Une énergie que je ne peux identifier.
Mais elle grandit tout le temps.
Il est environ 40% autre chose.
Je ne me sens pas différent.
On doit trouver d'où
vient cette énergie.
Sûrement du même endroit que le gant
qui d'après sa constitution,
ne vient pas d'ici.
Owen dit qu'il est allé quelque part
quand il s'est évanoui.
L'énergie et le gant pourraient
venir du même endroit.
C'est-à-dire, une autre dimension ?
Un univers parallèle ?
Eh les gars, je suis toujours là.
Désolé.
Tu dis que quelque chose t'attendait,
dans les ténèbres.
Je l'ai senti, je ne l'ai pas vu.
Où penses-tu être allé ?
Aucune idée.
Et maintenant ?
<i>Ianto, vérifie le système de
surveillance d'anomalies dimensionnelles.</i>
Ce que je t'ai dit, quand je
croyais que tu allais mourir...
Je ne mourais pas. Je suis mort.
Je suis un poulet sans tête
qui n'a pas encore arrêté de courir.
Quand je t'ai dit que je...
Oui, tu ne le pensais pas, je sais.
Ah bon ?
Oui, tu n'as jamais rien dit et
d'un coup c'est : "Je t'aime".
C'est pas de l'amour. Juste de la peine.
Tu perds quelque chose,
donc tu le veux désespérément.
Oui, mais... T'en va pas !
Je vais aux toilettes.
Pour pleurer sur mon sort !
<i>Melkurian.</i>
<i>Abatha.</i>
<i>Duroc.</i>
<i>Minus.</i>
<i>Mill kabal.</i>
Melkurian abatha.
Duroc minus mill kabal !
Tu as vu Owen ?
Il était avec Toshiko.
Il vient de subir un pic d'énergie.
Owen ?
Il est allé aux toilettes.
Son système digestif
ne fonctionne plus.
Il ne peut rien avaler,
donc pas besoin d'y aller.
Il ne répond pas.
Il n'est plus ici.
Il est sorti ?
C'est Owen, c'est pas
comme s'il était dangereux.
T'en es sûr ?
T'insinues quoi ?
Tu peux ramener les gens à la vie et tu
ne l'as pas signalé à UNIT. Pourquoi ?
Ils auraient voulu l'utiliser.
Je suis de ton côté. Owen a eu un
pic d'énergie qu'on ne comprend pas.
Les cellules de son corps se
transforment en autre chose.
Il est à 50% humain.
Et ces 50% sont morts.
On doit cesser de le
considérer comme Owen.
Je le trouverai.
Souris, ça va pas te tuer.
Tu es vraiment beau.
- Tu ne m'aimes pas ?
- Dégage.
Pas de sang, super.
Comment tu m'as trouvé ?
Tu sais ce que tu as fait ?
Tu te fous de moi.
Tu m'as ramené pour un code d'alarme !
Non, c'est pas pour ça.
Tu sais ce que ça fait de
savoir que ta vie est finie ?
Et que c'est tout ?
Voilà la contribution
d'Owen Harper au monde.
Espèce d'idiot !
Lâchez-moi !
- Lâchez-moi !
- Attention à lui !
Ça suffit.
On se calme !
Je suis de Torchwood.
Bien sûr, et moi de MI5.
Je suis Owen Harper. Je travaille
pour les forces spéciales de Torchwood.
Forces spéciales ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il raconte ?
Besoins spéciaux, plutôt !
Appelez ce numéro. Demandez
l'officier de police Gwen Cooper.
Je veux porter plainte.
Arrête.
Tu es mort.
Si tu te casses la cheville, tu
penses qu'elle guérira toute seule ?
Tu veux ajouter une chaise
roulante à tes... problèmes ?
J'avais oublié.
Je n'ai plus de système digestif.
L'alcool que j'ai bu va rester dans
mon estomac, il n'ira nulle part.
Tu peux pas te faire vomir ?
Je suis mort. Le réflexe pharyngé fait
partie des choses que j'ai perdues.
Attends. Si je peux
aligner mon oesophage...
C'est la chose la plus dégoûtante que
j'ai jamais vue. Et je m'y connais.
Désolé Jack. J'ai oublié que ça
continuait un moment après la mort.
Pitié, laissez-moi sortir !
Mais ça finira par s'arrêter.
Je péterai une dernière fois.
Bon sang. Péter va me manquer.
Le sexe aussi.
Le sexe plus que les pets, j'espère.
On fait pas attention à tout ça.
C'est quand on perd ces choses qu'on se
rend compte combien elles sont géniales.
Je vois peut-être ces taches ou
ces briques pour la dernière fois.
"On ne reconnaît la beauté
que dans la souffrance".
Oui. Qui a dit ça ?
Proust.
- Tu as lu Proust ?
- Oui.
Enfin, non.
On est sortis ensemble un moment.
Il était vraiment immature.
On ne sait jamais si on doit te
prendre au sérieux quand tu dis ça.
Quand tu as vécu aussi longtemps,
tu n'inventes plus rien.
Tu as l'éternité. Je pourrais avoir
seulement quelques secondes.
Ça parait injuste.
Ça l'est.
Mais l'éternité est surestimée.
Pas de mon point de vue.
Quand tu as l'éternité, tu ne
remarques pas les taches sur le béton,
tu te fiches des briques.
Tu mets tes amis en danger,
sachant que les enjeux ne
sont pas les mêmes pour toi,
qu'ils pourraient y rester
alors que tu t'en sors sans rien.
Pourquoi m'avoir ramené ?
Par culpabilité ?
Non, ce n'est pas ça.
Alors pourquoi ?
Je n'étais pas prêt à te laisser partir.
J'espérais un miracle.
Et c'est toujours le cas.
Rentrons.
Torchwood. Autorisation :
Harkness Jack. 474317.
Jack a appelé, il a trouvé Owen.
Ils vont bien, ils arrivent.
Il est lui-même ?
Comment ça, lui-même ?
Je voulais savoir pourquoi il est parti.
Enfin plutôt s'il a répété ce que je lui
ai dit, alors j'ai vérifié les caméras.
Ça ressemble à du harcèlement.
Je sais !
Je regrette de l'avoir fait. Regarde.
<i>Melkurian abatha</i>
<i>Duroc minus mill kabal</i>
Oh mon dieu.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Ils sont trop nombreux, ils m'en
veulent car je leur ai volé le gant.
Ils doivent vraiment t'en vouloir.
Owen !
Reste là.
- Owen, derrière moi.
- OK.
Allez.
Bon sang, que se passe-t-il ?
Melkurian abatha !
Duroc minus mill kabal !
Je dois savoir ce qu'Owen dit.
Comme nous tous.
Ceci ne nous a jamais laissé tomber.
On devrait pouvoir diffuser la
traduction dans les haut-parleurs.
Ça n'a encore jamais fait ça.
<i>Je parcourrai la terre et ma
faim ne connaîtra aucune limite.</i>
Je le sens vraiment pas.
Tu n'as pas idée.
Je suis le roi des Weevils.
Peut-être même leur messie.
Dans tous les cas, c'est
pas une bonne nouvelle.
En effet, et je pense
que c'est déjà arrivé.
D'où ça vient ?
D'un article sur la mort noire.
Tu as sous les yeux les
premières images de la Faucheuse.
Je parcourrai la terre et ma
faim ne connaîtra aucune limite.
D'après la légende, c'est la Mort
elle-même qui a prononcé ces mots.
Mais elle n'existe pas.
Oui, je suis mort. Pas La Mort.
Il y a une différence.
Est-ce qu'il le sait ?
Ces gravures remontent au 15ème
siècle, dans la paroisse de St James.
Quand ils ont eu vent de la peste, ils
ont construit un mur autour de la ville.
Malheureusement, une petite
fille a tout de même succombé.
D'après la légende,
le prêtre a réalisé un miracle.
Il l'a ramenée à la vie, mais
elle n'est pas revenue seule.
Elle a amené la Mort avec elle,
et elle a marché parmi eux.
On va vraiment se baser
sur une recherche google ?
Comment s'appelait l'église du prêtre ?
Ste Mary.
C'est là que j'ai trouvé le gant,
donc la paroisse de St James...
est la ville qui 500 ans plus tard
est devenue Cardiff.
Qu'est-il arrivé à la ville quand
la Mort a marché parmi eux ?
Des gens sont morts.
12 personnes.
Il fallait 13 âmes à la Mort
pour pouvoir rester sur terre.
Comment l'ont-ils arrêtée à 12 ?
Ils parlent de croyance.
Owen change.
Qui sait ce qu'est cette énergie ?
Et si ça le transformait en hôte,
comme une porte d'entrée ?
Je croyais qu'une chose attendait
que je passe enfin dans les ténèbres.
Mais je me suis trompé.
C'est tout l'inverse.
Elle essaye de venir ici à travers moi.
Qu'est-ce que ça indique ?
80%.
Et quand ça sera fini ?
On combat des monstres. Et quand j'en
deviendrai un, qu'est-ce qu'on fera ?
Même si l'on doit te combattre,
tu es déjà mort.
Que fait-on avec les morts ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on en fait ?
On les embaume.
En injectant une solution
formaldéhyde dans mes veines,
mes signaux nerveux et donc
mon cerveau seront pétrifiés.
C'est le seul moyen d'en être sûr.
Tu es sûr de toi ?
La formaldéhyde pourrait m'irriter,
mais l'éthanol neutralisera ses effets.
C'est un cancérigène puissant, mais je
crois que je n'ai pas à m'en soucier.
Tu sais ce que je veux dire.
Oui.
Je ne peux pas dormir, boire, ni baiser.
Et ce sont trois de
mes choses préférées.
Owen !
Je ne suis plus le même, Gwen.
Je suis revenu différent, vide.
Comme s'il manquait quelque chose.
Et je ne veux pas être comme ça.
Je suis prêt.
Owen est à 95%.
Ne perdons pas de temps.
Pas d'adieux.
Prêt pour la première injection ?
Quelqu'un n'aime vraiment
pas les aiguilles.
Martha !
Owen, ne bouge pas.
On se disperse.
Où est-il passé ?
Je crois qu'il est sous le meuble.
Ça va ?
Oui, je crois.
bien
Il est là.
Ton arme !
En le détruisant,
tu pourrais perdre la connexion.
Tout de suite !
Oh mon dieu !
Martha ?
Que lui est-il arrivé ?
C'est le gant.
C'est lui qui a fait ça.
Owen, aide moi.
Je parcourrai la Terre,
et ma faim ne connaîtra aucune limite.
Police. Il nous faut un médecin !
Où est-elle passée ? Owen !
Qu'est-il arrivé à cette chose ?
- Partie.
- Elle est dehors ?
Comment la connaissez-vous ?
Vous n'êtes pas de la famille.
C'est une voisine. On prend soin d'elle.
On fait ses courses, ce genre de choses.
Son taux de globules rouges est anormal,
et elle est extrêmement déshydratée.
Tout ça a placé un poids
considérable sur son coeur.
- Vous devez l'aider.
- On essaye.
Mais vous devez accepter...
Elle a quoi, 80 ans ?
Faites ce que vous
pouvez, s'il vous plaît.
Ça doit être la Mort,
car elle a volé ma vie.
On trouvera comment inverser ça.
La dernière fois, quand Cardiff était
un village, 12 personnes ont été tuées.
Et ?
Pourquoi n'a-t-elle pas atteint 13 ?
Quel est le rapport avec la croyance ?
- Ianto, il nous faut des réponses.
- Je m'en occupe.
Owen, rentre au QG.
Tu n'es pas en sécurité.
Jack, elle n'est plus en moi, promis.
Et je suis utile ici.
Quand elle est sortie, je l'ai sentie.
Je sais ce qu'elle est, je sais
ce qu'elle veut. C'est Duroc.
- Et c'est quoi ?
- La Faim.
Où la trouver ? Par où commencer ?
Pas besoin d'aller bien loin.
Elle est là.
Pourquoi nous aurait-elle suivis ici ?
Ce n'est peut-être pas le cas.
Elle sent peut-être les
gens proches de la mort.
Si tu étais la Mort, tu ne
t'attaquerais pas à un hôpital ?
Capitaine Jack Harkness. Torchwood.
Vous devez faire évacuer l'hôpital
St Helen de toute urgence.
Ici Torchwood, dirigez vous aussi vite
que possible vers les sorties, merci.
Je peux avoir de l'aide ?
Mettez vos robes de chambres.
Ce n'est pas un exercice.
Ecoutez-moi attentivement.
Mesdames et messieurs,
ce n'est pas un exercice.
Dirigez-vous vers le point de
rassemblement sur le parking.
Ianto, accède au système de
communication de l'hôpital.
Déjà fait. Ils ont plusieurs
codes 4 en soins intensifs.
- A quel étage ?
- Sixième.
- Qu'est-ce qu'un code 4 ?
- Crise cardiaque.
Nous devons compter les morts,
préviens-moi si on arrive à 12.
- Tu as vu Jamie ?
- Non.
Je te retrouve dehors.
Jamie ?
Jamie, tu es là ?
Owen, Tosh, on est au sixième.
Nous avons des victimes. Il y en a 7.
J'ai entendu parler d'une victime
durant une opération routinière.
On va dire que ça fait 8.
Il en reste 5.
- Quoi ?
- On est 5.
Elle était au sixième étage, est-ce
qu'elle est montée ou descendue ?
Les étages du haut ont été évacués.
Si elle a encore faim, je dirais...
OK, on descend.
Jack, on ne sait toujours pas
quoi faire si on la trouve.
Ianto ?
J'ai tapé "Je parcourrai la Terre
et ma faim ne connaîtra aucune limite"
mais je suis toujours
re-dirigé vers Weight Watchers !
<i>C'était un journal médical.
L'histoire de la Médecine.</i>
Essaye en tapant Tavistock ou Wellcome.
On est au septième.
Elle est là, je la sens.
Owen, tu me fais peur.
Je ne me rassure pas vraiment.
Allons-y.
Prends ma main. Allez !
- Il y a 12 morts.
- Et ?
D'après la légende, lorsque la Mort a
pris 13 âmes, elle devient invincible.
Elle parcourra la terre pour toujours.
Il ne lui en manque plus qu'une.
On n'a plus beaucoup de temps.
Je crois qu'on l'a semée.
Ou pas.
Si je trouve la bonne fréquence...
- Comment tu t'appelles ?
- Jamie Burton.
Je suis Owen, et elle Toshiko.
On va te sortir de là.
- Pourquoi es-tu là ?
- Une leucémie.
Jamie, ça va aller. Je vais
ouvrir cette porte très vite.
Jamie, ils t'ont admis
pour de la chimio ?
Déjà fait. Ça n'a pas marché.
Alors pourquoi es-tu là ?
Ils me font recommencer.
Mais ça n'a pas marché.
Le cancer est revenu,
ça a juste fait tomber mes cheveux.
Je vais mourir. Je préfère autant
que ce soit avec des sourcils.
Ianto, qu'est-ce que tu as ?
En 1479, le prêtre a découvert
qu'il fallait 13 âmes à la Mort.
Il l'a arrêtée à 12...
- Grâce à Croyance.
- Je sais !
Non, la petite fille qu'il avait ramenée
à la vie. Elle s'appelait Croyance.
- Elle l'a arrêtée.
- Comment ?
Je ne sais pas.
Elle n'avait rien à perdre.
Elle était déjà morte.
Jamie, tu as peur, c'est normal.
La chimio n'a pas marché et tu ne veux
pas endurer tout ça encore une fois.
Je comprends, vraiment.
Mais laisse-moi te dire que
tout le monde n'en meurt pas.
Ceux qui croient pouvoir vaincre la mort
ont le plus de chance de s'en sortir.
Et parfois, c'est possible.
Alors regarde bien, Jamie Burton.
Regarder quoi ?
Regarde-moi vaincre la mort.
- Allez !
- Vas-y !
Allez, Jamie. Prends-le.
Owen, je ne vais pas te laisser
affronter cette chose tout seul.
Je sais quoi faire.
Tu ne sais pas à quoi on a affaire.
Tu vas me détester.
Owen, ouvre cette porte !
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Combien de temps ?
Combien de temps peux-tu survivre
avec seulement 12 victimes ?
Rien ne t'attends, ici !
L'âme d'Owen Harper a quitté les lieux !
Il n'y a que nous deux, morts.
Non, Owen !
C'est tout ?
Que peux-tu faire d'autre aux morts ?
Jack !
Owen !
C'est tout ce que t'as ?
- C'est tout !
- Owen !
Non.
<i>Jack ?
jack ?</i>
Gwen ?
Quelqu'un ?
Alors, Docteur, ça vaut le coup
de commencer Guerre et Paix ?
Désolé que tu aies été touchée.
Que je t'aie fait du mal.
Je ne m'inquiète pas pour ça.
Tu as englouti une énorme quantité
d'énergie, mais elle se dissipe.
Ça s'annonce mal.
Je ne sais rien de ses propriétés.
Aucun de nous ne le sait.
Ça pourrait mettre 30 ans
à totalement disparaître.
Ou 30 minutes.
Jack ?
Des gens sont morts car tu m'as ramené.
On leur est redevable, toi et moi.
Je suis toujours un docteur.
Laisse-moi travailler.
Voir si on peut égaliser ce score.
On verra.
Il a vraiment vaincu la mort ?
On ne peut jamais vraiment
la vaincre, lui échapper.
Elle est toujours dans
l'ombre, à attendre.
Que fait-on, maintenant ?
<i>Je suis le Docteur Owen Harper.</i>
Officier de Torchwood numéro 565,
je vous relève de vos fonctions.
Qu'est-ce qui t'arrive ?
<i>Il y a 3 jours, je suis mort.</i>
Je suis cassé, Tosh !
<i>Et ils pensent que je vais bien.</i>
Qu'est-ce que t'es ?
<i>Mais ils ont tort.</i>
La maison de Parker. Un
pic d'énergie en provient.
Et ils s'agrandissent.
On doit y entrer.
Mais ça nous en empêche.
Des détecteurs de chaleur.
Comment passer à travers ?
<i>Je suis littéralement
froid comme la mort.</i>
Vous êtes de Torchwood ?
Et je passe une très mauvaise journée.

Torchwood -
outside the
Government, beyond the Police.
Fighting for the future
on behalf ofthe human race.
The 21st century is
when everything changes
and Torchwood is ready.
My name is Dr Owen Harper
and this is my life.
A life that is full of action
and violence and work, wonder.
Secrets, sex and love
and heartbreak...
..and death...
..my death.
The death I survived,
the death I am now living through.
Except. . .
this isn't living.
Every day it's the same.
I get up,
get ready for work the
same as everyone else.
The thing is, I'm not the same.
I get to work and everyone's
doing the same old thing.
Babbling away about aliens and weddings.
I'm not real.
Three days ago, I died.
And they think I'm
fine, but they're wrong.
So, are you ready to jump?

Would you just piss off.Get off my roof.
Your roof?
I'm going tojump, so just leave me alone.
Look, darlin', you know, I'm
not here to stop you.
Seriously.
You think you've got problems?
What, did your man dump you?
Sorry, love, were you talking to me?
It'sjust I'm a bit busy right now.
I'm not really interested in lis. . .
What is that?
I got shot.
Yeah, right
0h, my God, what the hell are you?
I'm dead.
That's not...
Look, you can't be dead.
You're standing here. You're
talking. You're moving.
You're not dead.
You're. ..
You're dead?
Yeah, I was brought back...
like jesus really, but
without the beard, you know.
Shit, I'm never gonna have a beard.
Not that I wanted one you
understand, you know, one day I...
OK. OK. You're dead and that's. ..
that's clearly a bit shit and
I'm sorry and everything but,
if you are dead, then why are you here?
You can't be wanting to
jump. You can't die twice.
Sorry, are you an expert?
Sorry, are you an idiot
Yeah. I'm a dead idiot.
So, come on then,
what's it like?
What?
Well, being dead.
What delights have I
got to look forward to?
Darkness.
Nothing.
Cheery, thanks
Look,
why are you here?
'Dr Owen Harper, Torchwood Officer
565, I'm relieving you of your position.'
Bollocks. I'm
sorry, jack, this is bollocks.
Hand in your weapon
and your security pass.
But why? I'm fine.
Three days ago, you died.
We need to examine you.
We need to find out what you are.
We need to be certain you're OK.
Yeah, well it almost sounds
as if you care, well done.
Until I'm confident you're fit for duty,
Martha jones will replace you as
Torchwood's new medical officer.
She's doing all right
out of this, isn't she?
She's worked out a series
of tests and examinations.
And what if I refuse?
You'll be confined to the cells,
tested and if the results show
that you're a danger to the team,
appropriate steps will be taken.
I'm asking you, Owen.
Please, let us help you.
Let us make sure you're safe.
I'm gonna need your gun.
And your security pass.
Please. . .
And how long are Dr
j0nes's tests going to take?
As long as they need to.
And what the hell am I
supposed to do in the meantime?
We always need someone to make coffee.
Oh, no.
Voila.
Fresh and strong.
And, we couldn't `ust have a `ar
of mstanwi your coffee?
Have you seen what happens
when I drink, these days?-
0wen. Want a go?
Ooh, please
What's wrong with this?
You OK?
What do you think?
I bet you're loving this, aren't you?
It's like y0u've finally won.
I didn't realise we were in competition.
Oh, come on!
Even Tosh had more of
a life than you used to.
And now you're always out on
missions, you're shagging jack
and I'm stuck here making the coffee.
It's not like that, me and jack.
You and jack.
Gwen's getting married.
Martha's got her bloke.
God, even Tosh had Tommy.
This is really shit!
We've all gone through shit,
I've seen you dissect alien corpses,
I've SEEI1 yOU SBVC S0 many lives,
are you really going
to let this beat you?
So, you're choosing
me over the boyfriend?
Yeah, that's it.
You really don't need to worry, you
know, I don't want yourjob.
Yes, I know.
You just find me irresistible.
0h, yeah, that's it
Every morning I wake up and think
of ways to get you alone like this.
There is no sign of any muscle
decay. You're in great shape, as ever.
Hmm, no use coming onto me, jones.
I'm a changed man.
And. . .erm, no stiffening anywhere?
Well. ..
just answer the question.
No, no signs of rigor mortis.
So, if I keep up the
exercise, I won't atrophy?
Yep. And bonus, definitely looks
like you're not going to age either.
There's no further
sign of cell mutation.
You're 100% human.
BLEEPS 100% Owen.
Hi, Martha. Meeting in the
boardroom. Can you come down?'
You'd better go. ..
What about you?
Cappuccino with chocolate sprinkles.
What?
That's what you drink, isn't it?
Henry john Parker, used to be a looker,
now he's 80-odd and
even I have my limits.
Your basic millionaire
collector of alien hoo-hah.-
in the 'mostly harmless' category?
So, what's the problem?
I detected this at 0517 this morning.
Parker's house. There's an
energy spike coming from it.
I've never seen anything like it before.
OK So, the big question is, what's our
Mr Parker gone and found this time?
Why? Do you think he's a threat?
Well, he hasn't been up until now.
He's a bit Howard Hughes.
We know he's there, we
know he's not a threat.
But as the story goes, he hasn't
left the house since his wife died.
Nobody's seen him since 1986.
We've been monitoring Parker for ages.
There's nothing to be scared of is there?
Unlike, say, Tintin?
OK! I never liked Tintin.
What, he's weird. Funny face
and his hair isjust, is horrible.
- I always loved Tintin.
- Yeah, well you would.
And he never had a girlfriend
did he, just the dog,
so I reckon he was
actually shagging the dog.
OK, meanwhile, back at Torchwood.
Alien energy pulse!
We've got to check this Parker out, OK?
Tosh, can you get me a complete
schematic of the house.
Ianto, find out exactly what he's got.
Get me an inventory of
everything that he's bought.
Martha, can you get a hold
of his medical history?
- Sure.
- OK, let's get to it, guys.
Hey, Gwen, any news on Banana Boat?
Can you believe it?
Best Man, arrested in Lanzarote.
- What for? Ah,
- dodgy CDs.
'worldwide, nearly a million
people kill themselves each year.'
That's almost three times
the population of Cardiff.
- Makes you think.
- What are you?
Some sort of suicide geek?
No, just a doctor.
Infact, I'm notjust a doctor.
I'm a bloody brilliant doctor.
'I know you are.'
So why are you doing my job?
Because Gwen asked me to.
That's not what I mean.
Because you died, and
because you need help.
That's not a bad thing.
It is a bad thing that
you died obviously,
but it's not bad that you need
help, if you know what I mean?
You're kinda cute when you babble.
And you're kinda cute when you're
not chucking a scalpel about.
But I'm making the sodding coffee!
I mean, come on, won't
your bloke be missing you?
Has he seen jack? They always
get jealous when they meet jack.
Owen, I don't want yourjob.
Ijust want to do mine.
OK, I'm dead, but I am 100% human.
I'm fine.
You've sliced your hand open.
The wound's not going to heal,
so, you're going to have to
re-stitch it every week or so.
At least you don't need anaesthetic.
Yeah, can't feel anything.
I can't feel the needle or thread.
I can't feel your hands on mine.
Yet, I can touch things,
I can hold 'em,
I know they're there.
But I just can't feel anything.
I'm numb.
Do you see why jack's worried?
Bruises won't heal.
Bones won't mend. You're. .. fragile.
Yeah, well, I'd better get
used to doing things myself.
'So she offers to help
you and you push her away?
Charming.'
Yeah, hole in the chest.
Sorry if I don't follow
social niceties any more.
You mean you did before?
God, you're a pain in
the arse, aren't you?
Is that why your man dumped you?
Ooh, I hit a nerve?
What, did you get your heart broken?
No, actually. He died.
I'm sorry.
No you're not.
You couldn't care less about
me and I don't care about you.
just because we're both
planning on jumping,
it doesn't mean we have some
sort of special connection.
You don't know the half of it.
Give me something to do.
You knowl can't. Rules and regulations.
Fine.
I might as well go home then.
OK.
What exactly do I do when I get there?
Watch TV...
..chill.
jack, I'm dead.
I'm permanently chilled.
You know, you get to live forever.
I get to die forever.
It's funny that.
Oh, hello! Welcome to To Buy Or
Not To Buy, the property show...
Do you mind ifl eat, I'm starving?
No, help yourself.
So, jack asked you to come round did he?
'Talk to Owen. 'Get him
to open up, godammit!'
You haven't changed.
It's all about Owen.
I've had a hell of a morning, you
know. Do you have a...?
Top drawer.
So, jack calls me in
at 5.00 this morning.
He could have waited
until I got in, but no,
strange energy spike and
it's 'Let's get Tosh in.'
0h, and when Gwen got
in, first thing she did?
Say sorry for not asking
me to be bridesmaid.
I mean, me, a bridesmaid?
You sound like an old married couple.'
Brian used to say I talked too much.
Tell me about him.
Today's my wedding anniversary.
My perfect day...
It was an accident.
We'd been married less than an hour.
I was picking confetti out
of my hair when it happens.
- Shit. I'm...
- Sorry, yeah.
I know.
You waited until your wedding
anniversary to kill yourself?
- Why?
- Does it matter?
Why have you waited?
Because I believe people.
I believe them when they
said it would get better.
So, what do you think, Doctor?
Do you really think it's
going to get any better?
I ran it through the language
translator and it's flipping Croatian.
Why are you here, Tosh?
I want to help you.
And how are you going to do that?
How are you going to help me?
I mean, am I going to be
a new 'special project'?
Come on, Owen, Ijust...
That's not why you're here is it?
For some reason you want
me, you know I don't know why,
but you always have, you're always looking
at me, watching me screw other women,
your heart breaking
and now it's different,
because I'm safe now, aren't I?
And it's all cosy and it's
romantic and isn't it beautiful?
You can say what you
like. I'm not leaving you.
0f course, not. This is it, isn't it?
This is the date that
we were talking about.
You've got your beer, you've
got pizza, you and me,
it'sjust how you wanted it.
All we need now is a sodding pool table.
Stop it! What's wrong with you?
I'm broken, Tosh!
I don't work, I've got no
heartbeat, no feelings, no tears,
I have got nothing to give you!
- I. ..
- Do you understand that?
Maybe that's what you want, maybe you
want somebody who's as screwed up as you!
Who's twisted and screwed up like
you are. You want to see broken,
do you want to see broken, Tosh?
Owen! Stop it! What are you doing?!
36 minutes. Not bad.
You were watching?
Skinny guy in tight
jeans runs into water?
I was taking pictures!
How long's this going to go on for, Owen?
Ianto, what have you
found out about Parker?
I've identified some ofthe things
he's purchased over the past year.
We've got a Dogon eye.
A pair of Myakian wings, meteorites.
An Arcateenian translation
of james Herbert's 'The Fog'.
But there are a few things
we've never seen before.
So one of these is
causing the energy spikes?
And they're getting dangerously bigger.
Right, OK we need to get in there.
Parker employs a Mr Philip
Farrington to run security.
There's at least six
guards, CCIˇŻV everywhere,
all of which we can bring down
by taking out the generator,
but then there's these...
Heat sensors.
- As in body heat?
- Yep.
Solar-powered.
There's one on every
doorway, every window.
So, how do we get past them?
Sounds like you need a dead man.
Someone with no body heat.
What have you got to lose?
Tosh?
I turned your telly off.
You screamed at her, you said
all those things, and that's it?
That's Tosh.Always the professional.
I don't care. I'm not interested
in you, in old men or alien meteors.
I came here because my husband died.
Ijust want to jump.
- Let's get on with it.
- Get off me!
You, you're too scared.
Aren't you?
How did you get from that to here?
What happened?
If you hurt yourself, you
will not recover.
Like I said, any bruises you
get, they're not gonna heal.
Do not engage in physical combat.
One punch you're gone.
Be careful.
I understand, I'm made of glass.
Owen?
just take care.
0h, and you'll need this.
'0wen?'
Yeah... Hi, Tosh.
'OK, the power in the house is supplied
from one private electrical generator.
'There's a backup unit
but take the main one down
and you've got one
minute, twenty of blackout time.
You can only get rid
of one of the blokes?
Look suspicious with two phone calls.
Try and make it the big one, OK?
ares
- Hello?
- Mr Taylor?
Yeah, that's right, who's this?
I'm calling from St Helen's Hospital.
'Mrs Christine Taylor was brought in an
hour ago. 'She's been in a car accident.'
Is she hurt?
'She's going to be fine but
she's asking to see y0u.'
I'm on my way.
- You all right?
- It's Chrissie, she's been in an accident. Look, I've got to go.
Yeah, of course.
Mr Farringdon?
Ben's had to go. His
wife's been in an accident.
OK, guys, I'm here.
Move away from there.
I said!
Yeah, OK, guys. Very funny !
No, no, no.
- Do you want to see what I can do?
- What?
I'm dead already, mate.
'Webb? Dave, are you there?'
Oh! One minute, twenty untilthe
backup generator comes online.
'This is Farrington to all units. 'The backup
generator will be running in 45 seconds.
Stay at your posts, please.
'Mr Parker's personal
generator is unaffected.'
'Sorry, Owen, they've
obviously had some work done.'
Heat sensors.
I am literally too cool for school.
Right, I'm in.
'OK, the energy reading seems to
be coming from the first floor.
'A room at the back ofthe house.'
Can you give me anything else?
'No, the energy source is playing
havoc with the system, sorry.'
No worries. I'm getting
used to being in the dark.
Hold it there.
Evenin'.
Nice place y0u've got here.
Love what you've done with the pictures.
Who are you?
Why aren't the sensors picking you up?
OK, stop!
Stop or I'll shoot.
No, you won't.
You're a security guard.
That gunsjust for show, innit?
Do you know what a bullet
does to a living person?
It's not like a knife
through butter, no, no, no, no.
It rotates, tears into the flesh
and the gooey stuff behind.
Rips into the
organs, and, ooh, it's not nice.
But anyway, I haven't got any body heat,
you must know what that means?
You can't kill a dead man.
What are you?
- I'm wrong.
- What are you?!
I'm broken.
I'm Dr Owen Harper.
And I'm having one hell of a day.
Yes?
It's OK, mate. I'm not going
to hurt you. I'm a doctor.
You're a very violent doctor.
I've been watching you.
Henry Parker, yeah?
You're Torchwood, yes?
Did the Americans send you?
Yeah, they sent me.
How do you know so much about us?
They could've sent that
japanese girl, I liked her.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry you got me.
Is she on your phone thing?
- The earpiece?
- Yeah.
Hello! just to say y0u've
got very lovely legs.
You should show them off more.
What's wrong with you?
Three heart attacks and a failed bypass.
But I'm fine, because I have this.
It's called the Pulse.
You know what it is?
I named it.
It's keeping me alive.
No! You're not taking it.
It could be dangerous,
we've been detecting
massive energy readings.
I don't care.
All I know is, it works.
Well, I'm sorry, it doesn't.
What?
The energy isn't going into you.
The p0wer'sjust building
up inside that thing,
that's what we've been detecting but it
isn't actually doing anything for you.
You're wrong.
I can feel it.
- No, no. I'm not going to die.
- Listen to me.
There are loads of peoples' lives at risk. If
that explodes we can't predict the fall-out.
You're young, you don't
understand wat dying feels like.
Believe me, I do. I really do.
- There's nothing there!
- Where?
0n the other side, nothing, I'm dying.
Take away my Pulse and I'm gone.
My body decomposing.
You can't stop it, Mr Parker.
I'm sorry, but it's
going to happen one day.
Itll be dark and I'll be alone.
Where are you now?
It's dark and you're all alone,
so what's the difference?
I don't understand
what's keeping me here.
It's hope.
That thing, it'sjust hope.
Do you really think all
this is better than death?
It's got to be.
It is better!
You're just scared ofthe darkness.
join the club.
Trust me, I know how
shit everything can be.
Don't you sit there
pontificating, you're just a boy,
what do you know about anything?
I've travelled the world.
I fought in the war.
Started my own business.
I made a fortune!
Married.
Widowed.
My collection, all of it.
I've done so much and
this is where I ended up.
Alone. Lying in my own piss
and do you know what I want?
- Clean sheets?
- I want a steak.
Medium rare.
Black pepper sauce.
Look at me. Fed through a tube.
I might as well be dead already.
I might as well be dead.
Why don't you take it?
Well?
0h, Christ, it's dark, I'm
alone, I'm so alone.
It's all right,
I'm here with you.
I'm still stuck here, though.
In this bed, in the dark.
You know what?
I'm going to come back.
You and me.
We're going to face
all of this together,
I'm going to help you.
Torchwood,
if you come back, you can tell me
all about it. Tell me what it's like.
I want to hear about the
aliens and everything!
I need to know that
there's more out there.
That this isn't all there is.
Oh, come on, I'm dying,
who am I going to
tell, the Angel Gabriel?
If you come back,
I won't tell the japanese girl
that you're still holding my hand.
Well, maybe.
Mr Parker?
I'm so sorry!
'I couldn't save him.'
I needed to give him air but I couldn't.
I've got no breath.
Everything I've seen,
everything that's out there
and it was an old man
dying of a heart attack.
just another person dying because of me.
Everything that's happened
and that was the final straw.
Because at that moment I
just wanted it all to end.
'0wen.'
Owen, can you hear me?
Owen, come in!
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.
The device?
'Is it doing anything because the
energy levels 'coming from it are...
Owen?'
Owen! It's going off the screen.
It's going to explode!
Tosh? What can we do?
Nothing! There's nothing!
It's OK.
I'm going to hold it.
Owen, what are you doing?
'See if I can absorb it.'
Owen, the energy reading's off
the scale. You won't survive.
It's OK, these things happen.
There must be something we can do.
- Martha, Martha.
- Owen?
If it destroys me,
they're going to need a new
doctor, y0u've got all the credentials.
Medical skills, a cracking arse.
j6Ck?ˇ¤
If you even attempt
to bring me back again.
'Gwen, Ioto, it was fun.
'Honestly, thank y0u.'
Tosh?
Tosh? Come on, answer me.
'0wen.'
I'm sorry.
I love you.
What happened?
We all assume life's
going to be shit, don't we?
That it's alljust darkness.
But you know what?
Sometimes, it's not.
What is it?
Do you remember in the '70s,
NASA sent messages into space?
A map of our solar system, pictures
of what we look like.
It had images and voices, music.
Even a bit of Chuck Berry.
This is a reply,
not that we know who from.
What does it do?
It sang to me.
It's a glimmer of light in the darkness.
See?
Sometimes it does get better.
I'm sorry, Drjones.
No vacancies in Cardiffjust yet.
That's OK.
I reckon you're. ..
I was going to say 'fine'
but you're a hell of
a lot more than that.
Thank you.
For everything.
It's what I'm here for.
You take care.
Well, it's been...
interesting.
Oh, it's been fun. You know it has.
Well, everyone else has had a go.
Oh, you can S0 come back any time!
Well, maybe I will. One day.
'Promise me something.'
What's that?
No more locking it all away.
You tell me when it's bad.
Share it with me.
OK?
Tosh, I'm scared.
I'm scared that if I close
my eyes I'll get trapped,
in the darkness.
I'm here.
'And that's when I saw y0u.'
I thought you came here to jump?
No,
I came hereto help.
What do I do now?
You've got a choice.
If you think that the darkness
is too much then go for it.
But if there is a chance, just some hope.
It could be having a cigarette,
or that first sip of hot
tea on a cold morning,
or it could be your mates,
if there's even a tiny glimmer of light
then don't you think that's
worth taking a chance?
What's your name?
Maggie.
Maggie Hopley.
Well, Maggie, it's upto you.
Your choice.
Do you still want to jump?
'My name is Owen Harper
'and this is my life.'
Careful, Gwen.
This thing eats people.
And what is that exactly?
It's a shapeshifter.
With a taste for human flesh.
You're going to have
to postpone the wedding.
You're pregnant!
An alien egg in your belly and
it's mother coming to rip you open.
That is all we need.
In five hours, I'm
walking down the aisle.
You are not thinking straight.
All I want to do today is marry you.
That's the problem with shapeshifters.
I'm not an alien!
You never know what you're looking at.

Torchwood.
Au delà du gouvernement et de la police.
Ils se battent pour
le futur de l'humanité.
C'est au 21ème siècle que tout bascule.
Et Torchwood est prêt.
Je suis le Docteur Owen
Harper et voici ma vie.
Une vie pleine d'actions, de
violence, de travail, d'émerveillement.
De secrets, de sexe,
d'amour, de chagrin...
Et de mort.
Ma mort.
La mort à laquelle j'ai survécu.
Celle que je vis.
Sauf que ce n'est pas la vie.
Chaque jour est le même.
Je me lève, me prépare.
Comme tout le monde.
Mais je ne suis plus le même.
Je vais travailler et
ils font comme d'habitude.
A chahuter à propos des
extra-terrestres ou des mariages.
Je ne suis pas réel.
Il y a trois jours, je suis mort.
Ils pensent que je vais
bien, mais c'est faux.
Alors, vous êtes prête à sauter ?

Vous voulez pas dégager ?
- Dégagez de mon toit.
- Votre toit ?
Je vais sauter alors laissez-moi.
Je ne suis pas là pour vous arrêter.
Sérieusement.
Vous pensez avoir des problèmes ?
Votre mec vous a plaquée ?
Pardon, vous me parliez ?
Je suis un peu occupée là.
Je suis pas vraiment intéressée par...
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Je me suis fait tirer dessus.
Oui, c'est ça.
Bon sang, qui êtes-vous ?
Je suis mort.
C'est pas...
C'est pas possible.
Vous êtes debout.
Vous parlez. Vous bougez.
Vous n'êtes pas mort.
Vous êtes mort ?
Oui, j'ai été ramené.
Comme Jésus, mais sans la barbe.
Merde, je n'aurais jamais de barbe.
Pas que j'en voulais une,
mais un jour...
OK. Vous êtes mort et c'est...
Ca va surement sembler
bizarre et je suis désolée
mais si vous êtes mort,
pourquoi êtes-vous là ?
Vous ne pouvez pas vouloir sauter.
Vous ne pouvez pas mourir deux fois.
Pardon, êtes-vous une experte ?
Pardon, êtes-vous idiot ?
Oui, je suis un idiot mortel.
Alors, comment c'est ?
De quoi ?
Eh bien, d'être mort.
Qu'est-ce qui m'attend de bien ?
Les ténèbres.
Rien.
Sympa, merci.
Pourquoi êtes-vous là ?
<i>Docteur Owen Harper. Officier
de Torchwood numéro 565,</i>
<i>Je vous relève de vos fonctions.</i>
Conneries.
Désolé Jack, mais c'est des conneries.
Ton arme et ton laissez-passer.
Mais pourquoi ? Je vais bien.
Tu es mort il y a trois jours.
On doit t'examiner.
On doit découvrir ce que tu es.
Pour être sûr que tu vas bien.
On dirait presque que tu
t'en soucies, bien joué.
Tant qu'on ne sera pas
sûrs que tu peux travailler,
Martha Jones te remplacera en tant
que nouveau doc de Torchwood.
Elle s'en sort plutôt bien, non ?
Elle a préparé une série
de tests et de contrôles.
Et si je refuse ?
Tu seras confiné aux cellules,
tu seras évalué et si les résultats
montrent un quelconque danger
des mesures seront prises.
Je te le demande, Owen.
S'il te plaît, laisse-nous t'aider.
Laisse-nous vérifier
que tu vas bien.
Il me faut ton arme.
Et ton laissez-passer.
S'il te plaît.
Combien de temps les tests du
Docteur Jones vont prendre ?
Aussi longtemps qu'il faudra.
Qu'est-ce que je suis censé
foutre pendant ce temps ?
On a toujours besoin de café.
Oh, non.
Voilà.
Chaud et fort.
- On pourrait pas avoir autre chose.
- Je croyais que tu l'aimais.
Tu n'as pas vu ce qu'il
se passe quand je bois ?
Merci Owen. Tu veux essayer ?
Je t'en prie.
Qu'est-ce qui va pas...
Ca va ?
Qu'est-ce que tu crois ?
Je suis sûr que tu apprécies, non ?
On dirait que tu as fini par gagner.
Je savais pas qu'on
était en compétition.
Même Tosh a eu plus dans sa
vie que tu n'auras jamais.
Maintenant tu viens en mission,
tu couches avec Jack et je
suis coincé ici à faire du café.
C'est pas comme ça, Jack et moi.
Ouais, ouais. Jack et toi.
Gwen se marie.
Martha a son mec.
Bon sang, même Tosh avait Tommy.
C'est vraiment la merde !
On passe tous par là. Je t'ai vu
disséquer des corps extra-terrestres.
Je t'ai vu sauver tant de vies.
Tu vas vraiment laisser ça t'abattre ?
Alors comme ça tu me choisis
à la place de ton copain ?
Oui, c'est ça.
Tu n'as pas de quoi t'inquiéter.
Je ne veux pas ton travail.
Oui, je sais.
Tu me trouves juste irrésistible.
Oui, c'est ça.
Chaque matin je me lève et je pense à
un moyen de me retrouver seule avec toi.
Aucun signe de
décomposition des muscles.
Tu es en grande forme, comme toujours.
Pas besoin de faire du
rentre dedans, Jones.
Je suis un homme changé.
Des durcissements quelque part ?
Eh bien...
Réponds-moi juste.
Non. Pas de signe de
rigidité cadavérique.
Si je continue de m'exercer,
je ne vais pas m'atrophier ?
Non. Et en cadeau, tu ne vas pas
vieillir non plus.
Aucun signe de mutation des cellules.
Tu es 100% humain.
100% Owen.
<i>Martha. Réunion en salle de conférence.</i>
<i>Tu peux venir ?</i>
Tu devrais y aller... Docteur.
Et toi ?
Cappuccino avec pépites de chocolats.
Quoi ?
C'est ce que tu bois, non ?
Henry John Parker, un
tombeur en son temps.
Il a maintenant 80 balais,
et même moi, j'ai mes limites.
Le millionnaire classique qui
collectionne des joujoux aliens.
Dans la catégorie
"globalement inoffensif" ?
Quel est le problème ?
J'ai détecté ça à 5h17 ce matin.
A la maison de Parker.
Un pic d'énergie en provient.
Je n'ai encore jamais vu ça.
La question est donc,
qu'est-ce que M. Parker a
bien pu découvrir cette fois ?
Pourquoi ?
Tu penses qu'il est une menace ?
Il ne l'a encore jamais été.
Il a des airs d'Howard Hughes.
On sait qu'il est là, et
qu'il n'est pas une menace.
Mais d'après ce qu'on dit,
il n'a pas quitté sa maison
depuis la mort de sa femme.
Personne ne l'a vu depuis 1986.
On a surveillé Parker
pendant des années.
Pas de raison d'en avoir peur, si ?
Pas comme Tintin, par exemple.
OK ! Je n'ai jamais aimé Tintin.
Quoi ? Il est bizarre.
Drôle de tête et ses cheveux
sont tout simplement horrible.
J'ai toujours aimé Tintin.
Ca m'étonne pas.
Il n'a jamais eu de
copine, juste son chien.
Je pense qu'il couchait
avec, d'ailleurs.
Pendant ce temps, à Torchwood...
Pic d'énergie extra-terrestre.
On doit tout vérifier sur lui.
Tosh, fais-moi un schéma
complet de la maison.
Ianto, découvre exactement
ce qu'il possède.
Fais un inventaire de tout ce qu'il
a acheté ces 10 dernières années.
Martha, tu peux trouver
son dossier médical ?
Bien sûr.
OK, c'est parti les gars.
<i>Gwen ? Des nouvelles de Banana Boat ?</i>
<i>Tu y crois ça ?</i>
<i>Témoin, arrêté à Lanzarote.</i>
<i>- Pour quelle raison ?
- Pour des CD suspects.</i>
<i>Environ 1 million de personnes se
suicident chaque année dans le monde.</i>
C'est presque 3 fois la
population de Cardiff.
- Ca fait réfléchir.
- Qui êtes-vous ?
Une sorte d'accroc au suicide ?
Non, juste un docteur.
En fait, je ne suis
pas juste un docteur.
Je suis un super bon docteur.
<i>Bien sûr que tu l'es.</i>
Alors pourquoi tu fais mon travail ?
Gwen me l'a demandé.
C'est pas ce que je voulais dire.
Parce que tu es mort et
que tu as besoin d'aide.
C'est pas une mauvaise chose.
C'en est une que tu sois mort,
mais pas que tu aies besoin d'aide,
si tu vois ce que je veux dire.
Tu es charmante quand tu bafouilles.
Tu l'es aussi
quand tu joues pas avec un scalpel.
Mais je fais ce putain de café !
Tu vas pas manquer à ton mec ?
Il a déjà vu Jack ?
Ils deviennent toujours
jaloux après l'avoir vu.
Owen, je ne veux pas ton travail.
Je veux faire le mien.
Je suis mort mais je suis 100% humain.
Je vais bien.
Tu viens de te trancher la main.
La blessure ne guérira pas.
Tu vas devoir te recoudre
chaque semaine environ.
Au moins tu n'as pas
besoin d'anesthésie.
Oui, je ne sens rien.
Je ne sens ni l'aiguille, ni le fil.
Je ne sens pas tes
mains sur les miennes.
Pourtant, je peux toucher
ou tenir des choses.
Je sais qu'elles sont là.
Mais je ne les sens pas.
Je suis engourdi.
Tu comprends pourquoi Jack est inquiet ?
Les bleus ne guérissent pas.
Les os non plus. Tu es fragile.
Je devrais m'habituer
à faire ça tout seul.
<i>Elle propose de vous aider et</i>
<i>vous l'envoyez balader ? Sympa.</i>
Oui, balle dans le torse...
Désolé si je ne suis plus très sociable.
Pourquoi, vous l'étiez avant ?
Vous êtes une sacrée teigne, hein ?
C'est pour ça que votre
mec vous a larguée ?
Je touche le point sensible ?
Quoi, il vous a brisé le coeur ?
Non. Il est mort.
- Désolé.
- Non, vous ne l'êtes pas.
Vous vous fichez de moi et
je me fiche de vous.
C'est pas parce qu'on
se prépare à sauter,
qu'il existe un lien spécial entre nous.
Vous ne croyez pas si bien dire.
Donne-moi quelque chose à faire.
Je ne peux pas.
C'est les règles.
D'accord. Je vais rentrer alors.
D'accord.
Qu'est-ce que je dois
faire exactement, chez moi ?
Regarde la télé... T'échauffe pas.
Jack, je suis mort.
Je ne risque pas.
Tu te retrouves à vivre pour toujours.
Moi à mourir pour toujours.
C'est drôle.
Ca t'embête si je mange ?
Je meurs de faim.
Non, vas-y.
Alors Jack t'a demandé de passer ?
"Parle à Owen".
"Fais-le se confier, bon sang !".
Tu n'as pas changé.
Toujours le centre du monde.
J'ai eu une matinée
horrible. Tu as un...
Tiroir du haut.
Jack m'appelle à 5h ce matin.
Il aurait pu attendre
que j'arrive, mais non.
Un pic d'énergie étrange et
c'est "Allons chercher Tosh".
Et quand Gwen arrive, la
première chose qu'elle fait ?
S'excuser de ne pas m'avoir
proposé d'être demoiselle d'honneur.
Moi, demoiselle d'honneur ?
<i>On croirait un vieux couple.</i>
Brian disait toujours
que je parlais trop.
Parlez-moi de lui.
C'est mon anniversaire
de mariage, aujourd'hui.
Mon jour de rêve...
Il y a eu un accident.
On était mariés depuis
moins d'une heure.
J'enlevais les confettis de
mes cheveux quand c'est arrivé.
- Merde. Je suis...
- Désolé, ouais.
Je sais.
Vous avez attendu votre anniversaire
de mariage pour vous suicider ?
Pourquoi ?
- Qu'est-ce que ça change ?
- Pourquoi avez-vous attendu ?
Parce que je crois les gens.
Je les crois quand ils
disent que ça ira mieux.
Qu'en pensez-vous, Docteur ?
Vous pensez vraiment
que ça va s'arranger ?
Je l'ai passé au traducteur de langage
et c'est vachement Croate.
Pourquoi t'es là Tosh ?
Je veux t'aider.
Et comment ?
Comment vas-tu m'aider ?
Je vais devenir quoi,
un projet spécial ?
Arrête Owen, je veux juste...
C'est pas pour ça que t'es là, si ?
Je ne sais pas pourquoi,
mais tu me veux.
Tu as toujours été là, à me regarder.
A me regarder baiser d'autres
femmes, le coeur brisé.
Maintenant c'est différent
car je suis plus sûr, hein ?
C'est tout mignon et romantique.
C'est beau, non ?
Tu peux dire ce que tu veux.
Je ne te quitterai pas.
Bien sûr que non. Ca y est, hein ?
C'est le rencard dont on parlait.
Tu as ta bière, ta pizza.
Toi et moi. Comme tu voulais.
Tout ce qu'il nous faut c'est
une putain de table de billard.
Arrête ! Qu'est-ce qui va pas ?
Je suis brisé, Tosh.
Je ne marche plus. J'ai pas de pouls.
Pas de sentiments, pas de larmes.
Je n'ai rien à te donner !
Tu comprends ça ?
C'est peut-être ce que tu veux.
Quelqu'un d'aussi brisé que toi.
Qui peut être autant
tordu et brisé que toi ?
Tu veux voir quelque
chose de brisé, Tosh ?
Owen ! Arrête ça !
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
36 minutes. Pas mal.
Tu regardais ?
Un gars mince dans un jean
moulant qui se jette à l'eau ?
Je prenais des photos !
Combien de temps ça va durer, Owen ?
Ianto, qu'est-ce que
tu as trouvé sur Parker ?
J'ai identifié certains de ses
achats des dernières années.
On a un Oeil de Dogon.
Une paire d'ailes de
Myakian, des météorites.
Un traduction en Arcaténien du
livre Fog, de James Herbert.
Mais certains restent inconnus.
C'est ce qui produirait
le pic d'énergie ?
On dirait. Et ça devient de
plus en plus gros et dangereux.
D'accord. On doit y aller.
Parker emploie un certain M. Philip
Farrington qui gère la sécurité.
Il y a au moins 6 gardes,
des caméras partout.
On peut tout arrêter en
anéantissant le générateur.
Mais il y a ça...
Des détecteurs de chaleur.
Chaleur corporelle ?
Oui. Production solaire.
Il y en a un dans chaque couloir,
à chaque fenêtre.
Alors, comment on fait ?
On dirait que vous
avez besoin d'un mort.
Quelqu'un sans chaleur corporelle.
Qu'est-ce que tu as à perdre ?
Tosh ?
J'ai éteint ta télé.
Vous lui avez crié dessus,
vous lui avez dit tout ça,
et c'est tout ?
C'est Tosh. La professionnelle.
Je m'en fiche.
Vous ne m'intéressez pas,
ni les vieux ni les météores aliens.
Je suis venu ici car mon mari est mort.
Je veux juste sauter.
- Allons-y, alors !
- Lâchez-moi !
Vous, vous avez trop peur.
Pas vous ?
Comment êtes-vous arrivé là ?
Que s'est-il passé ?
Si tu te blesses, tu ne guériras pas.
Comme je l'ai dit,
les ecchymoses ne guériront pas.
Ne t'engage dans aucun combat physique.
Un coup et c'est fini.
Fais attention.
J'ai compris. Je suis de verre.
Owen ?
Fais attention.
Tu auras besoin de ça.
<i>Owen ?</i>
Oui, Tosh ?
<i>Le courant de la maison provient
d'un générateur électrique.</i>
<i>Il y en a un de secours,
mais détruit le principal.</i>
<i>Tu auras une minute et 20 secondes.</i>
Tu ne peux te débarrasser que
d'un seul garde ?
Deux coups de fils
sembleraient bizarre.
Essaye de faire sortir le grand, OK ?
Fais chier.
- Allô ?
- M. Taylor ?
Oui, qui est-ce ?
J'appelle de l'hôpital St Helen.
<i>Madame Christine Taylor a
été internée il y a une heure.</i>
<i>Elle a eu un accident de voiture.</i>
Elle est blessée ?
<i>Ça va aller, mais elle
demande à vous voir.</i>
Bien sûr, j'arrive tout de suite.
Ça va ?
C'est Chrissie, elle a eu un accident.
Je dois y aller.
Oui, bien sûr.
M. Farrington ?
Ben a dû partir.
Sa femme a eu un accident.
OK les gars, j'y suis.
Dégagez de là.
J'ai dit...
Sympa les gars. Très drôle.
Non...
Vous ne voulez pas voir
ce que je sais faire ?
Quoi ?
Je suis déjà mort, mon gars.
<i>Webb ? Dave, tu es là ?</i>
1 minute et 20 secondes avant que le
générateur de secours prenne le relais.
<i>Farrington à toutes les unités.</i>
<i>Le générateur redémarrera
dans 45 secondes.</i>
<i>Restez à vos postes.</i>
<i>Le générateur de M. Parker
n'est pas touché.</i>
<i>Désolée Owen, ils ont dû
faire des modifications.</i>
Détecteurs de chaleur.
Je suis littéralement
froid comme la mort.
OK, j'y suis.
<i>Le flux d'énergie semble
venir du premier étage.</i>
<i>Une pièce au fond de la maison.</i>
Tu peux m'en dire plus ?
<i>Non, la source d'énergie
brouille le système, désolée.</i>
Pas de soucis.
Je commence à avoir l'habitude
d'être dans le noir.
On ne bouge pas !
Bonsoir.
Belle maison que vous avez là.
J'aime ce que vous avez
fait avec les peintures.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Pourquoi les capteurs
ne vous ont pas signalé ?
Arrêtez-vous !
Arrêtez ou je tire.
Bien sûr que non.
Vous êtes un garde de sécurité.
Les armes c'est pour faire beau, non ?
Savez-vous ce qu'une balle
peut faire à un être vivant ?
C'est pas comme un couteau
dans le beurre, non.
Ça tourne, déchire la chair
et les trucs visqueux derrière.
Ça arrache les organes,
et c'est pas joli.
Mais de toute façon, je n'ai pas
de chaleur corporelle,
vous devez savoir ce que ça veut dire.
Vous ne pouvez pas tuer un homme mort.
Qu'avez-vous ?
- J'ai tort.
- Qui êtes-vous ?
Je suis brisé.
Je suis le Docteur Owen Harper.
Et je passe une très mauvaise journée.
Oui ?
Ça va aller.
Je ne vous ferai pas de mal.
Je suis docteur.
Vous êtes un docteur très violent.
Je vous observais.
Henry Parker ?
Vous êtes de Torchwood.
L'américain vous a envoyé ?
Oui, en effet.
Comment nous connaissez-vous ?
Ils auraient pu envoyer cette
fille japonaise, je l'aime bien.
Désolé, vous m'avez moi.
Elle est au téléphone avec vous ?
L'oreillette ? Oui.
Salut !
Juste pour dire que vous
avez de très belles jambes.
Vous devriez les montrer plus souvent.
Que vous est-il arrivé ?
Trois crises cardiaques,
et un pontage loupé.
Mais je vais bien.
Car j'ai ça.
Ça s'appelle le Pouls.
Vous savez ce que c'est ?
Je l'ai nommé.
Ça me garde en vie.
Non, vous ne le prenez pas.
Ça pourrait être dangereux.
On a détecté d'énormes flux d'énergie.
Je m'en fiche.
Tout ce que je sais,
c'est que ça marche.
Je suis désolé, mais non.
Quoi ?
L'énergie ne va pas en vous.
L'énergie se forme dans cette chose,
c'est ce qu'on a détecté mais,
ça ne vous fait rien.
Vous avez tort.
Je le sens.
Non. Je ne vais pas mourir.
Ecoutez-moi.
Il y a beaucoup de vies en jeu.
Si ça explose, on ne peut
en prévoir les retombées.
Vous êtes jeune, vous ne savez
pas ce que c'est de mourir.
Croyez-moi, si. Je le sais.
- Il n'y a rien là-bas !
- Où ?
De l'autre côté.
Rien, je meurs.
Prenez mon Pouls et je partirai.
Mon corps se décompose.
Vous n'y pouvez rien M. Parker.
Je suis désolé.
Mais ça arrivera un jour.
Il fera noir et je serai seul.
Où êtes-vous maintenant ?
Il fait noir et vous êtes tout seul,
quelle est la différence ?
Je ne comprends pas
ce qui me retient ici.
C'est l'espoir.
Cette chose, c'est de l'espoir.
Vous pensez vraiment que tout
ça est bien mieux que la mort ?
Ça doit l'être !
C'est mieux !
Vous avez peur des ténèbres.
Bienvenue au club.
Faites-moi confiance. Je sais
combien ça peut être pourri.
Ne faites pas votre messie,
vous êtes juste un garçon,
qu'est-ce que vous en savez ?
J'ai parcouru le monde.
J'ai fait la guerre.
J'ai créé mon entreprise.
J'ai fait fortune !
Marié.
Veuf.
Ma collection, tout ça.
J'ai fait tant de choses.
Et c'est ici que je m'arrête.
Seul.
Allongé dans mon urine.
Vous savez ce que je veux ?
Des draps propres ?
Je veux un steak.
A point.
Sauce au poivre.
Regardez-moi.
Nourri par un tube.
Je pourrais tout autant être mort.
Je pourrais autant être mort.
Pourquoi vous ne le prenez pas ?
Alors ?
Bon dieu, il fait noir.
Je suis seul. Si seul.
Ça va aller.
Je suis avec vous.
Je suis toujours coincé ici, pourtant.
Dans ce lit, dans le noir.
Vous savez quoi ?
Je vais revenir.
Vous et moi.
On va combattre tout ça ensemble.
Je vais vous aider.
Torchwood. Si vous revenez,
vous pourrez tout me raconter.
Me dire comment c'est.
Je veux savoir pour les
extra-terrestres et tout le reste !
J'ai besoin de savoir
qu'il y a bien plus.
Que ce n'est pas tout.
Oh, voyons !
Je meurs. A qui je le dirais ?
L'ange Gabriel ?
Si vous revenez,
je ne dirai pas à la fille japonaise,
que vous tenez encore ma main.
D'accord, peut-être.
Respirez profondément.
M. Parker ?
Henry.
Henry.
Je suis désolé !
<i>Je n'ai pas pu le sauver.</i>
Je devais lui donner de
l'air mais je n'ai pas pu.
Je n'ai pas de souffle.
Avec tout ce que j'ai vu...
Tout ce qu'il reste à voir...
Et c'est un vieil homme qui
meurt d'une crise cardiaque.
Une autre personne qui
meurt à cause de moi.
Avec tout ce qui s'était passé,
c'était la cerise sur le gâteau.
A ce moment.
Je voulais que tout s'arrête.
<i>Owen.</i>
<i>Owen, tu m'entends ?</i>
Owen, réponds !
Oui, je suis là.
L'objet, il fait quelque chose ?
<i>Le niveau d'énergie est
en train de... Owen ?</i>
Owen ! Le niveau explose.
Ça va exploser !
Tosh ? Qu'est-ce qu'on peut faire ?
Rien ! Rien à faire !
C'est bon.
Je vais le tenir.
Owen, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
<i>Je vais l'absorber.</i>
Owen, les flux d'énergie sont
énormes. Tu ne survivras pas.
Ça ira. Ces choses là arrivent.
On peut bien faire quelque chose ?
- Martha !
- Owen ?
Si ça me détruit,
ils auront besoin d'un nouveau docteur.
<i>Tu as le potentiel.</i>
Le talent médical, un beau cul.
<i>Jack ?</i>
Si tu essayes de me ramener à nouveau...
<i>Gwen, Ianto, c'était sympa ! </i>
<i>La plupart du temps...
Merci.</i>
Tosh ?
Tosh ? Allez, réponds.
<i>Owen.</i>
Je suis désolé.
Je t'aime.
Que s'est-il passé ?
On croit tous que la vie
va être de la merde, non ?
Que c'est juste les ténèbres.
Mais vous savez quoi ?
Parfois, ça ne l'est pas.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Dans les années 70,
la NASA a envoyé des
messages dans l'espace.
Une carte de notre système
solaire, des photos de nous.
Il y avait des images et
des voix, de la musique.
Même un peu de Chuck Berry.
C'est une réponse,
bien qu'on ne sache pas d'où.
Qu'est-ce que ça fait ?
Il chante.
C'est une lueur dans les ténèbres.
Vous voyez ?
Parfois ça s'arrange vraiment.
Je suis désolé, Docteur Jones.
Pas de poste à pourvoir à Cardiff.
C'est bon.
Je reconnais que tu es...
J'allais dire "bien"
mais tu es largement plus que ça.
Merci. Pour tout.
Hé !
C'est ce pour quoi je suis là.
Prends soin de toi.
Eh bien, ce fût...
intéressant.
C'était génial, oui.
Et tu le sais.
Tout le monde y a déjà eu droit.
Tu peux revenir quand tu veux.
Peut-être, oui. Un jour.
<i>Promets-moi quelque chose.</i>
Quoi donc ?
Ne garde plus tout ça pour toi.
Dis-moi quand ça ne va pas.
Partage avec moi.
D'accord ?
Oui.
Tosh, j'ai peur.
J'ai peur qu'en fermant les yeux,
je reste bloqué... dans les ténèbres.
Je suis là.
<i>Et c'est là que je vous ai vu.</i>
Je croyais que vous étiez
venu ici pour sauter ?
Non, je suis venu pour aider.
Qu'est-ce que je fais maintenant ?
Vous avez le choix.
Si vous pensez que les
ténèbres sont trop dures,
alors allez-y.
Mais s'il y a une chance,
un peu d'espoir.
Ça pourrait être une cigarette,
ou cette première tasse
de thé en un matin froid,
ou vos amis.
S'il n'y a rien qu'une
petite lueur d'espoir,
alors vous ne croyez pas que
ça vaut la peine d'essayer ?
Comment vous appelez-vous ?
Maggie. Maggie Hopley.
Eh bien, Maggie.
C'est à vous.
C'est votre choix.
Vous voulez toujours sauter ?
<i>Je m'appelle Owen Harper</i>
<i>et voici ma vie.</i>
Attention, Gwen !
Cette chose mange les gens.
Et qu'est-ce que c'est exactement ?
Un changeur de forme.
Avec un faible pour la chair humaine.
Tu vas devoir annuler le mariage.
Tu es enceinte !
Un oeuf alien dans ton ventre
et maman vient te l'arracher.
C'est tout ce qu'il nous faut.
Dans 5 heures,
je marcherai vers l'autel.
Tu n'es pas sensée !
Tout ce que je veux faire
aujourd'hui, c'est t'épouser.
C'est le problème avec
les changeurs de forme.
Je ne suis pas un extra-terrestre !
Tu ne sais jamais à qui t'attendre.

Torchwood. Outside the
Government, beyond the police.
Fighting for the future on
behalf of the human race.
The 21st century is
when everything changes.
And Torchwood is ready.
What's this?
That's an engagement ring, that is.
You're getting married?
Yes, Rhys asked.
And you said yes?
Well, no-one else will have me.
I need stability, jack, someone
I can rely on.
Friday night
0h, it's the service she's meant
to be late for, not her hen do.
Where is she?
Here she is!
Here comes the bride Looking for a ride
Here comes the bride And
she'll take it up the aisle!
Ey, thought you'd bottled it.
No, I had a lot on at work.
2 hours earlier
Careful, Gwen...
this thing eats people.
Oh, sorry, love, on your way.
jack, It's a shape-shifter!
He could look like anyone now, but
he's leaving a trail of black blood.
He's changed but it's definitely him.
He's heading towards Trinity Street.
So, is there anything to eat
tonight, or is itjust booze all the way?
Booze, blokes, bopping and booze!
Gwen Cooper, you're nicked.
Oh, no.
This is such a bad idea.
I'm getting married in...
like, what, what.. thirteen hours.
Oh, look at me!
Ah, you're gorgeous. Rhys is so lucky.
I know. I've heard about his cock!
What have you done to your arm?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Owen should take a look at that.
Um, nothing, it'sjust a scratch.
Saturday morning
Gwen.

Something Borrowed</font>
Gwen, you're pregnant. Almost full term.
Pregnant? That's not possible.
How are you doing, Gwen?
jack, tell me what's going on?
- Owen says I'm pregnant.
- You think?
jesus Christ. What with?
It's an exo-biological insemination.
That alien last night.
0h, get off.It bit me, jack. That's all.
It passed the eggs on in the bite.
Some species do that. A sneaky
way of keeping the bloodline going.
Boy, would Darwin have a field
day, if he'd made it to space.
Mmm. Yeah. Great.
Listen, Gwen, you are going
to be fine, I promise, OK?
If there was any biological
incompatibility you would be dead.
Now, according to this scan you're
carrying a non-sentient blastopheric mass.
A what?
It's a kind of alien egg. But I'm
going to look after you, I promise.
We've got procedures for this situation.
This has happened before?
You've heard of immaculate
conception, haven't you? Well...
Right, we take you back to the Hub.
You lie back, I run a bio-xenic microtron, a
couple of days, you'll be right as rain.
Whoa, a couple of days?
In five hours I'm walking
down the aisle, Owen!
No, you're not.
Gwen, I hate to say this, but you're
going to have to postpone the wedding.
No! No way. Have you any
idea how much a wedding costs?
Listen, Gwen, you are not
carrying the baby jesus.
I don't care! I can't
put Rhys through this.
He's had to put up with enough, OK?
So I'm not postponing the wedding.
You are not thinking straight.
Do not bring my bloody hormones
into this, Mrjack Harkness!
OK, calm down.
Owen has said if this wasn't safe
I would know about it by now. Right?
As far as I know yeah...
OK, so I am good until after the wedding.
Then I'll do whatever I have to do.
Once I'm Mrs Williams.
Not before.
Hello?
- Rhys?
- Gwen!
Morning, lovely.
Don't worry... Banana Boat's on the phone
to the florist, checking the buttonholes.
0h, he showed up, then?
Yeah, Lanzarote cops let
him go with a warning.
Rhys, I need to see you.
It's bad luck before the wedding.
What's happened?
How is she?
She's going ahead with the wedding.
Which is fine, as long as she
doesn't go into labour at the altar.
Rhys might forgive her being pregnant,
but not giving birth to a razor-toothed
monster that eats his family.
Could that happen?
Well, look, the pregnancy's advanced and
we're not familiar with the species.
Which is why you, Owen, need to
open up the guy with the teeth
and make sure there's no surprises.
I'm on it.
Tosh, y0u've got an early pass to the
wedding. Keep an eye on Gwen. Ianto...
jack?
Gwen's going to need a
new wedding dress. Bigger.
Gwen? What is it?
You've got me going out of my head.
Don't tell me you're
having second thoughts.
No, I'm not.
Can I help you?
Yeah, I'm looking for a
wedding dress for a friend.
0f course you are, sir.
You'd be surprised, we're quite used
to men buying for their 'friends'.
- Bastard Torchwood!
- I know.
- Bastard Torchwood!
- I know.
Pregnant! You're pregnant!
Sorry, everything that could
have screwed things up...
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything, all right!
Sorry.
It's not your fault.
It's them, it's jack. ..
It's not like he didn't know
you were getting married today!
Why the hell did he have
to send you out last night?
Because it's my job!
Well, are you going to be all right?
I'll be fine.
They'll take me to the Hub.
- 0wen's got this big machine thing.
- Good.
Yes.
Right, erm, look, I'll...
get Banana to start ringing people.
We'll tell everybody
you're ill.Appendicitis. ..
We're not postponing the wedding.
No way.
Forget the money, I want you where
they can look after you, right?
Getting married today doesn't matter.
It matters to me!
It's not about the money, Rhys.
I want to marry you. Today.
Whatever happens.
If the skies are suddenly
fill full of spaceships,
or an army of weevils climb out ofthe
drains on St Mary's Street, you fool!
Do you not understand what
I'm saying, Rhys Williams?
All I want to do today is marry you,
that's all I want to do.
Erm, Owen?
- Look at you.
- Do you like it?
Drop-dead gorgeous, Tosh, and I
think I speak with some authority.
I don't really get a chance to
dress up much. What are you wearing?
The truth is, Tosh, weddings have
never really been me, either.
Love 'em and leave 'em. That was me.
Owen, you should come, could be fun.
Have you ever seen a dead man dance?
I've seen Fred Astaire
in Easter Parade. Twice.
Late night TV.
God, you need a date, don't you?
Which this isn't, is it?
No, Owen, it isn't.
I just want you to come to the wedding.
Please.
0h, all right, I'll dig
out my dancing shoes.
I know it's been a
while, duckling, but, er ....
We never dreamed this.
Rhys and I wanted it to
be a surprise for you.
You're always full of
them, but, well, this beats them all.
Is this why you haven't come to see us?
All those cancelled visits?
No, no, Dad, don't be silly. It's my job.
This mysterious job.
All the same, Swansea
isn't on another planet.
You could have phoned, duckling.
I'm sorry.
Oh, don't be sorry, Gwen.
I can't wait to see the
look on Rhys's mum's face.
It's wonderful news, Gwen! Your dad's been holding
his breath waiting for a little grandchild.
I was with Rhys and his
mates all night last night.
No-one said anything
about Gwen being pregnant.
Well, Rhys was probably under orders.
Gwen knows how to control her men.
Studied under the Mistress.
Oh, here's Rhys's mum and dad.
- Brenda.
- Geraint.
- Barry.
- Hello.
Lovely to see you, Brenda.
What a lovely outfit.
Such a brave choice for you.
And you were so made for green.
- Big day at last.
- How's the bride?
Erm, maybe there's something
we should talk about...
- Gwen!
- This isn't going to work, Rhys!
We haven't thought it through.
What about after the wedding?
I've been thinking the same.
My mum and dad think that
they're getting a grandchild.
Your mum and dad are going to be
excited, they're going to be planning things.
I can't tell them I've lost a baby.
They'll be devastated.
We could tell them the truth.
talk sense now, Rhys.
Well, the lies don't work, Gwen.
Remember? You tried it.
What do you think the
truth will do to them?
We've seen what comes through the rift.
I don't want my mum and dad living in fear
of what's prowling around in the sewers!
I'm sorry.
Hey, jack.
Hey. How are you doing?
Oh, you know, so far so good.
Look, Tosh should be with you any time.
Call it moral support.
I don't need a baby-sitter.
Give it here.
We don't need you at all, jack!
You've already done
plenty to mess up today.
Do us both a favour and
keep well out of it, yeah?
Yeah, I hear you, Rhys.
Look, still, congratulations...
It's not his fault...
Aw, this is nice, in't it, Trina?
Class on toast. Ey, you
should get a brochure, Mervyn.
If some poor girl ever gets
drunk enough to marry you.
Eh, yeah, that's funny,
I tell you what, it's going to take more than a
swanky hotel to get a catch like me down the aisle.
And here's mad Mervyn, the
Minister of Sound!
Well, the Duke of Disco, the Regent
of Rock and the Lord of Love.
Whatever you say, mate. Listen, do you
want a hand with the decks and the lights?
Aye, but...
I tell you what, reckon I'm up for
a bit of a Mervyn sandwich later.
All right, love? You've got a big
box. Do you want a hand with that?
No, thank you. I'm fine.
Are you going to the wedding?
I'm a friend of Gwen's.
I'm Banana.I suppose you can tell why.
You come up in spots
and go soft quickly?
I'm playing the best man.
Evolution is full of surprises.
I get to check everything
personally, right.
- The disco, cake, flowers, seating.
- Bridal suite?
Do you fancy a little drink later?
Sorry, I'm intolerant
to vaso-active amines.
Bananas make me vomit.
Now, a looker like you must
be on the bride's side.
I don't think they've got your
sort of style in Rhys's family.
I like to put on a show.
jack sent me over with this.
It's beautiful.
And, I don't blame you for telling
jack and Owen to stick a postponement.
I think it's wonderful you're
getting married, whatever.
Tosh, thank you.
You're very lucky.
You know, Tosh, it'll
happen for you, one day.
There's always Owen. ..
I don't think so.
'In sickness and in
health, till death do us part'?
That's going to sound
like a bad joke, isn't it?
Erm, I'll let you get on.
If you need me, I'll be downstairs.
-Good luck.
- Thank you.
No, I like that one. Good choice.
I estimated Gwen's size from
the Hub security laser scans.
As you know, my dad was a master tailor.
He could size a man's inside leg measurement
by his stride across the shop threshold.
Ah, the family eye.
Remind me to test it some time.
- Well, if later on. ..
- jack.
- Yeah, brilliant, like that one.
- We've got a problem.
Look what our friend was hiding.
And that is?
A proteus gland. The shape-shifting
organ of a Nostrovite.
- And what is that, exactly?
- Trouble.
Big trouble.
No good-looking woman
should be at a wedding without a flower.
Ouch!
Bugger. Sorry.
Can I get you another drink?
Actually, do you feel
like getting a bite?
Another spritzer, please.
My God! It's true!
But how?
Steady on, girl.
I'm on stage later.
Hey, baby, if you're looking for
my room, youjust passed it, mind.
I'm not. And don't call me 'baby'.
So what shall I call you, then?Beautiful?
Don't call me anything.
Don't say anything.
Don't move!
What have you done with him?
What the hell is going on?
You're lucky, I'm watching my figure.
But maybe I'll keep you for tea.
A Nostrovite is a shape-shifting
carnivore with a taste for human flesh.
It's intelligent and sneaky and, damn
it, I should have seen this before.
That's it with shape-shifters - you
never know what you're looking at.
What's the big deal? It's dead.
Yeah. This one is.
Does there have to be more?
Nostrovites mate for life.
You know, like swans and penguins.
Yeah, except you don't find
Nostrovites on greetings cards.
Right, and then the male Nostrovite carries
the fertilized eggs in a sac in its mouth
and passes it on to a host with a bite.
Gwen.
And where does the mother come in?
Well, she tracks down the
host, and rips it open.
That's Nostrovite childbirth.
And momma's out there right
now, looking for Gwen. Come on.
Are you all right?
0h, yeah, yeah, it wasjust a twinge.
He'll be flexing his muscles.
Not long to go now.
Tosh isn't responding.
Then let's get going.
Sure you're ready for this, Owen?
You know Nostrovites.
You think it's 100 feet away, and
it's chewing on your liver.
I don't need my liver. You need me.
The singularity scalpel?
Where are you going with that?
We need to get to Gwen
before the Nostrovite,
we might not get back to the Hub and
the microtron weighs about two tonnes.
That thing kills people.
- I saved Martha with it.
- Lucky shot.
Listen you two, you'd
better start trusting me, OK?
I've been working on
it, and I've got it sussed.
With that Nostrovite, we
don't have too many options.
He's got a point.
What is it with you?
Ever since Owen died, all you
ever do is agree with him.
I was brought up never
to speak ill ofthe dead.
Even if they're still talking.
OK, Owen. But you better be
sure you know what you're doing.
Camouflage dressing?
I'm having her dressmaker's number.
No way did Gwen look
pregnant last night.
0h, we must have had
way too much to drink.
She was late, wasn't she?
We must have been out of our
heads by the time she showed up.
0h, must have been, not to
notice she was pregnant.
Great night, or what?
You look like an angel.
Mum, I'm so sorry about this.
Gwen, it's a baby.
It's G0d's blessing.
You will be a good
wife, and a wonderful mother.
And me and your dad, we'll always be
there for you, and for our grandchild.
I'll see you downstairs.
I love you.
Mom..I love you too.
Hurry up, Geraint. And make sure
you don't leave a wet patch!
Gwen?
What is it?
I can't do this.
I can't lie to you and Mum, Dad.
Dad, this baby isn't Rhys's.
There's still no sign of Banana Boat.
He'll be fine, Dad.
Rhys, your mother says this
wedding is becoming a nightmare.
As if Gwen showing up
pregnant wasn't bad enough.
Now you are sure it's yours, aren't you?
Dad! I'm marrying her!
I love Gwen, every atom of me loves Gwen,
has done since the first
time I laid eyes on her, OK?
You loved Cerys Morgan once.
I was 12 years old!
Still no Banana Boat.
Get away from me.
Well, I wish I could, love.
Don't bother, I've
tried. We're stuck fast.
I can't believe it.
Can you at least move your hand? Away!
If there's another man, if you don't want to
go through with the wedding, it's all right.
We'll sort things out.
There isn't another man.
- But you said.
- Please listen.
Cardiff is in the middle
of a space-time rift.
A what?
I work for an organisation that
controls what comes through it.
Comes from where?
Other planets. Other dimensions.
Aliens, Dad.
I'm talking about aliens.
That's what I do, Torchwood.
We're called Torchwood.
We hunt down aliens that
come through the rift.
Oh, my God.
Look, one bit me last night, don't
ask me to explain, I can't.
I'm pregnant. Rhys isn't the father.
It's an alien.
It's an alien.
Poor girl, this wedding's
got her stressed to pieces.
Thinks that baby of hers is
an alien from outer space.
- What?
- It'll be all right.
Once we get through today.
Gwen seems to be taking her time.
You remember how it is, Brenda.
The bride likes to make an entrance.
Maybe, but I wasn't late for my wedding.
No. Barry might have got away.
If it comes back, it's
going to kill us, isn't it?
Calm down. I've got friends.
They'll find us.
But what if they don't?
What if it comes back? I mean, we're
it's bloody packed lunch, in't we?
Help! Help!
- Shut up!
- Help! Someone help!
If it hears you screaming, it'll
come and shut you up... permanently!
Help! Someone! Help.
That's enough, unless you want
to start singing in falsetto.
That really hurt.
Friends and family of Rhys and Gwen,
we're here today to celebrate
the marriage of two people,
a ceremony binding in law...
- How much further?
- A few minutes.
If people are going to make such
a big deal about getting married,
why come all the way out
into the middle of nowhere,
where no-one can find you, to do it?
That, to me, suggests inner conflict.
It's because the happy couple
want everything to be perfect.
An alien egg in your belly and
its mother coming to rip you open.
Yeah, perfect. ..
Rhys and Gwen have chosen to solemnise
their commitment before you...
But first the law requires
me to ask of you all,
if there is anyone here...
who knows of any reason
why these two may not marry?
Stop!
Stop it! Stop the wedding!
- Hold on!
- jack?
Gwen, believe me, I'm sorry.
But this has to stop now.
Ijust knew that baby wasn't Rhys's.
What the hell are you doing here?
jack, I am marrying Rhys!
Not now. You can't.
Butt out! You've screwed things
up enough between me and Gwen.
You'll not mess up our wedding!
Listen, I am trying to save Gwen's life.
Yours, too.
What's going on, jack?
I've got a fix on Tosh's comms.
Tosh. Are you OK?
just get me out of here!
All right, mate. I'm Banana.
- More like a gooseberry.
- Owen.
Oh, jesus, that's disgusting.
Let's get you out of there.
There were two of them?
Ma and Pa Nostrovite.
They hunt in pairs. But childbirth
is more of a. . .three-way.
He finds and impregnates a host.
She then comes in like the
midwife from hell, hanging around,
watching, waiting, until
the time is right.
Then it gets messy.
So you think it's near?
She's a shape-shifter, Rhys.
She could be out there making
small talk with your mom and dad.
You reckon it's all over, then?
Some good-looking guy sweeps up the aisle
and tells you to hold off on the confetti.
What are you going to do, marry Rhys?
So the baby's his, is it?
Didn't you see the look on
her face when he showed up?
Anyway, I'd better go and find Mervyn.
Tell him not to bother getting George
Michael out the back of the van.
We're not stopping the wedding.
Gwen, there isn't a choice.
Ever since I've met you, jack, all Rhys
has had to put up with, with me, is crap.
The lies. The danger. The complications.
But he's stood by me.
Who else would do that?
Who else would marry me
knowing that I am carrying
some kind of monster inside me?
I love him, and I'm going
to marrying him, today.
Thanks. But it is my wedding, too.
Don't I get a say?
That's all we need.
Ianto, after the girl, I
need this contained.
jack.
0h, God!
I want Gwen out of here now, jack.
jack, I've seen the shape-shifter.
It's a woman. She's in black.
Do you know what's going on?
I'm in the dark, too, Brenda.
The problem seems to be an American
with no sense of timing or fashion.
And your daughter!
Call the police!
Mervyn's been murdered!
jack, I'm afraid the
situation is uncontained.
OK, Ianto, get to the
SUV, jam the phone lines.
The last thing we need is
someone calling the police.
Tosh, you're with me, we'll
find that woman in black.
Gwen, Owen needs to operate now.
I want Gwen safe jack, now.
I want her safe, too, Rhys.
So we do what I say!
Rhys, jack knows what
he's doing darling, OK?
Look, if we run, the Nostrovite
will be waiting for us.
And we're running out of time.
What's the plan, jack?
I've got an idea.
Then I'm staying here OK?
Fine! Tosh, with me.
What the hell's going on here?
I had a signal before.
Move! I need everyone to stay
calm and do exactly as I tell you.
- Who the hell are you?
- Torchwood.
Gwen's Torchwood?
You mean you're real?!
- jack!There she is!
- Everybody down!
My God...!
Damn, that thing's fast!
But it won't have gone far.
Not without what it came for.
Come on.
That? The singularity scalpel?
That is your 'idea'?
Gwen, it's cool, believe me.
I've done a lot of work on it
since the whole Mayfly business.
What is it?
Alien medical apparatus...
so Owen thinks.
Thinks?
- Rhys? Rhys, are you in there, Rhys?
- That's his mother.That's Rhys's mother.
Hiya.
There's...There's a monster, Rhys.
That American and the japanese
girl, they went after it.
Stay here.
jack, everything OK?
It got away Owen. How's the patient?
Rhys and his mum are with her.
jack! That's Rhys's mum, there!
Come on.
This isn't Rhys's baby, Brenda.
It's an alien.
Get back, you ugly bitch!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
- That's my mother!
- No.
- It's the alien.
- I'm not an alien!
You're good, I'll give you that.
But I'm not!
Yeah, and the Lone Ranger
didn't have a thing with Tonto.
Does the shape-shifter copy smells too?
No. It'sjust physical.
Well, I'd recognise that
bloody awful perfume anywhere.
It's Brenda, jack.It's Brenda
That's for calling my
mother an ugly bitch!
If that's Rhys's mum, then
who's that outside?
Move! There she is!
The bond between mother and
child is a wonderful thing.
Let her go.
- Your mother for my child.
- No deal.
You don't have a say
Don't listen to it, Gwen.
It's OK, Mum, I'll make sure you're safe.
It won't kill you, you'll be OK.
You can't do this.
It's my Mum, Rhys. jack...
Rhys!
- OK, Mum...
- Gwen...
..you're going to be OK.
It's OK, Mum.
Stay calm, still.
Come to momma!
That's the kind of daughter
every mother must dream of.
Cool as ice, packing an automatic.
Gwen told me about you
but I didn't believe her.
It'll be back. Owen, get Gwen ready, I
want that thing dealt with now.
Gwen, I'll be with you in a minute.
I need to talk to Rhys.
- What about?
- Something and nothing. Trust me.
What, what?
Listen, Rhys, the singularity scalpel.
The last time I used
it I had two good mitts.
So you can't operate it?
I know you'd be more happy that whoever
had Gwen's life in their hands could...
well, rely on both of them.
Now I thought I could askjack. ..
No, no, erm, show me what to do.
Right, it kinda works itself.
Hello, jack.
Not quite the blushing bride, am I?
But I'd given up on things
going to plan a long time ago.
If life always turned out the way we
expected, what would be the point of living?
I didn't expect to
meet someone like you.
Ifl hadn't, I'd be married by now.
You're not the only one who met somebody
that knocked their world out of kilter.
Rhys has always been there for me.
Through all this madness, even
when I haven't even deserved it.
He's not afraid to tell me he loves me.
Gwen
Get her out of here!
Come on, then! Do me a favour!
Hey, are you all right?
I'm running around in a wedding dress with what
feels like a keg of lager stuck up my skirt.
What do YOU think, Rhys?
Come on.
What happened?
Put it down, Owen.
It thought that I'd gone off.
- Where's Gwen and Rhys?
- They've done a runner.
I emptied a clip into
that thing as did Gwen.
But some mother-instinct or something
is making that cow unstoppable.
Our guns don't work.
Then I guess we're
gonna need a bigger gun.
Rhys, I can't go any further!
- It's here!
- It'll hear!
I don't think there's any
point in keeping quiet, Gwen.
What the hell are you doing with that?
Owen showed me how to use it.
just do it! Do it!
- Rhys!
- All right, all right.
I've got it now.
I love you... I really love you.
Gwen!Gwen!
Gwen?!
Get away from her, Rhys!
Let me have my young
and I won't hurt you.
You're too late! It's gone!
And I've had a gutful of you!
You get my girlfriend pregnant,
you impersonate my mum and
you ruin my wedding day!
Fuck!
Rhys, you're a bad boy.
And you know what bad boys get?
How's that for a shape-shift?
Jack;
Hey, that whole Evil Dead thing
looks pretty good on you, Rhys.
- OK?
- Yeah.
And...
the hero always gets the girl.
I am sorry.
I've spoilt everything, haven't I?
Do you still want to marry me?
..I call upon these persons here present
to witness that I,
Gwen... Elizabeth. .Cooper. .
Do take thee, Rhys Alun Williams,
to be my lawful wedded husband.
..Do take thee, Rhys Alun Williams,
to be my lawful wedded husband.
Come here.
You ready to see that
dead man dance, Tosh?
Come on.
Mind ifl cut in?
Why not? I'm danced off my feet.
I'm gonna find a beer.
Enjoy the honeymoon.
I will.
What will you do while I'm gone?
Ooh, the usual.
Pizza, Ianto. ..
save the world a couple of times.
Will you miss me?
Always.
Rhys is a lucky man, a perfect husband.
He's loyal. . . brave. ..
..he's got a hell of a swing on him!
And best of all, he really loves you.
I know.
MayI...erm...?
Yes.
There you go.
Cheers, mate.
You'd never think a couple of hours ago they all
nearly got torn apart by some alien psycho-bitch.
It's all been a bit too
much for my mum and Brenda.
I never thought I'd see that.
OK, jack, what's going on?
Strange thing when you mix
Level Six retcon with champagne.
Really makes the party go with
a swing. Then you fall asleep.
You retconned our families?
It's probably for the best.
I don't want my mum remembering
what happened to her today.
Maybe the happy couple shouldn't either?
No, thank you. There'll be
no secrets in this marriage.
Time for bed, I think.
We'll see you after the honeymoon.
Stay out of trouble.
Thank you for the
dress. It was beautiful.
Something tells me our
bed time is a long way off.
That's right, guys, it's been a busy
day, but we are not finished yet.
We've got a lotto do. We've
got a major mop-up operation.
And I want your best work.
Remember, it's Gwen's wedding.
That's what I love about Torchwood.
By day you're chasing
the scum ofthe universe.
Come midnight, you're the Wedding Fairy.
It's more than just a cinema.
It's the Electro.
A once-in-a-lifetime
show.
Why not step inside?
I just saw jack.
Part of this freak show?
The night travellers, they did exist.
They only performed
at the dead of night.
So two people from a piece of
film have decided to go AWOL?
- What's wrong?
- Her mouth's been drained of moisture.
What the hell are they up to?
Time to bring the others.
This way, please.

Torchwood.
Au delà du gouvernement et de la police.
Ils se battent pourle futur
de l'humanité.
C'est au 21ème siècle que tout bascule.
Et Torchwood est prêt.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Une bague de fiançailles.
Tu te maries ?
Oui, Rhys a fait sa demande.
Et tu as dit oui ?
Personne d'autre ne veut de moi.
J'ai besoin de stabilité, Jack.
Quelqu'un sur qui compter.
<i>Vendredi soir.</i>
Elle va louper et son enterrement
de vie de jeune fille et le service !
Qu'est-ce qu'elle fabrique ?
La voilà !
<i>Voilà la mariée, qui
cherche un bien-aimé.</i>
<i>Voilà la mariée, et elle
lui fera monter l'allée.</i>
J'ai cru que t'allais nous lâcher !
Non, j'avais beaucoup de boulot.
<i>2 heures plus tôt.</i>
Sois prudente, Gwen.
Ce truc mange les gens.
Excusez-moi. Allez-y.
Jack, c'est un changeur de forme !
Il peut être n'importe qui,
mais il perd du sang noir.
Il a changé, mais c'est bien lui.
Il se dirige vers Trinity Street.
Alors, on a de la nourriture ce soir,
ou c'est juste de l'alcool à foison ?
Alcool, mecs, danse et alcool !
Gwen Cooper, c'est à nous.
Oh, non.
C'est vraiment une mauvaise idée.
Je me marie dans quoi... 13 heures.
Regardez-moi ça !
Tu es magnifique.
Rhys a vraiment de la chance.
Je sais. Je sais pour son pénis.
Qu'est-ce que t'as au bras ?
- Ça va ?
- Oui.
Owen devrait y jeter un oeil.
Rien, une égratignure.
<i>Samedi matin.</i>
Gwen.

Gwen, tu es enceinte.
Presque à terme.
Enceinte ? C'est impossible.
Comment ça va ?
Jack, que se passe-t-il ?
- Owen dit que je suis enceinte.
- Tu crois ?
Bon sang ! Enceinte de quoi ?
Insémination astro-biologique.
L'extra-terrestre d'hier soir.
Pousse-toi.
Il m'a mordu, c'est tout.
Il a inséminé les oeufs
par la morsure.
Certaines espèces font ça. Moyen
rusé pour maintenir sa descendance.
Si Darwin avait eu droit à une sortie,
il l'aurait faite dans l'espace.
Ouais. Super.
Ecoute, ça va aller. C'est promis.
S'il y avait des incompatibilités
biologiques, tu serais morte.
D'après le scanner, tu portes une
masse blastophorique privée de sens.
Une quoi ?
Une sorte d'oeuf alien.
Mais je vais te surveiller, promis.
Des procédures sont prévues
pour cette situation.
C'est déjà arrivé ?
Tu as entendu parler d'immaculée
conception ? Eh bien...
Bien, on te ramène au QG.
Je te fais un examen microtron bioxénique
et tu seras sur pieds en quelques jours.
Quelques jours ?
Dans 5 heures,
je me dirigerai vers l'autel, Owen !
Non.
Gwen, je suis désolé, mais tu vas
devoir repousser le mariage.
Non, pas question ! Vous savez
combien coûte un mariage ?
Tu ne portes pas le petit Jésus.
Je m'en fiche !
Je peux pas faire ça à Rhys.
Il en a assez vu comme ça.
Je ne repousse pas le mariage.
Tu n'es pas sensée !
Ne mêle pas mes putain d'hormones
à tout ça, M. Jack Harkness !
D'accord, calme-toi.
Owen dit que si ça n'allait pas,
on le saurait déjà.
D'après ce que je sais, oui.
Donc tout va bien jusqu'à
après le mariage.
Ensuite, je ferai ce qu'il faut.
Une fois que je serai Mme Williams.
Pas avant.
Allô ?
- Rhys ?
- Gwen !
Salut mon coeur.
T'inquiète pas, Banana Boat téléphone
au fleuriste pour les boutonnières.
Alors il est venu ?
Oui, les flics de Lanzarote l'ont
laissé partir avec un avertissement.
Rhys, il faut qu'on se voie.
Ça porte malheur avant le mariage.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Comment va-t-elle ?
Elle veut quand même se marier.
Ce qui ne pose pas de problème,
tant qu'elle n'accouche pas là-bas.
Rhys lui pardonnera peut-être
d'avancer vers l'autel enceinte,
mais pas de mettre au monde un monstre
aux crocs acérés qui mangera sa famille.
Ça pourrait arriver ?
La grossesse est avancée et
on ne connaît pas cette espèce.
C'est pourquoi tu dois ouvrir
l'homme aux dents pointues
et t'assurer qu'on n'ait pas de
mauvaise surprise.
Je m'en occupe.
Tosh, tu vas sur les lieux du mariage.
Surveille Gwen.
Jack ?
Gwen va avoir besoin d'une
nouvelle robe de mariée. Plus large.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Je suis en train de devenir dingue !
Me dis pas que tu as des doutes.
Non.
Je peux vous aider ?
Je cherche une robe de mariée
pour une amie.
Bien sûr, monsieur.
Nous avons souvent des hommes
qui achètent pour leurs... amies.
- Putain de Torchwood.
- Je sais.
- Putain de Torchwood.
- Je sais.
Enceinte. Tu es enceinte !
Désolée, de tout ce qui aurait
pu faire foirer le mariage...
Je ne sais pas quoi dire.
Ne dis rien, d'accord ?
Désolé.
C'est pas ta faute.
C'est la leur. C'est Jack.
C'est pas comme s'il ne savait
pas qu'on se mariait aujourd'hui !
Pourquoi il t'a envoyée
en mission hier ?
Parce que c'est mon boulot !
Ça va aller ?
Je vais bien.
Ils m'emmèneront au QG.
- Owen a une machine...
- Bien.
Oui.
Ecoute, je...
Je vais chercher Banana pour
commencer à appeler les gens.
On dira à tout le monde que
tu es malade. L'appendicite.
On ne repousse pas le mariage.
Hors de question.
Oublie l'argent, je préfère
qu'ils prennent soin de toi.
Se marier aujourd'hui
n'a pas d'importance.
Ça en a pour moi !
Ce n'est pas l'argent, le problème.
Je veux t'épouser. Aujourd'hui.
Quoi qu'il arrive.
Si le ciel se rempli tout à coup
de vaisseaux spatiaux,
si une armée de Weevil sort des égouts
devant l'église St Mar, idiot !
Tu comprends ce que je dis,
Rhys Williams ?
Tout ce que je veux aujourd'hui,
c'est t'épouser.
C'est tout ce que je veux.
Owen ?
- Regarde-toi !
- Ça te plaît ?
A tomber raide, Tosh, et je pense
m'y connaître en la matière.
Je n'ai pas beaucoup d'occasions
de bien m'habiller. Tu portes quoi ?
Pour dire vrai, les mariages n'ont
jamais vraiment été mon truc.
Aime-les et quitte-les,
c'était plus moi.
Tu devrais venir,
ça pourrait être sympa.
Tu as déjà vu un mort danser ?
J'ai vu Fred Astaire dans
"Parade de Printemps". Deux fois.
Télé tard le soir.
Il te faut un cavalier, c'est ça ?
Mais je ne le suis pas.
Non, Owen.
Je veux juste que tu viennes au mariage.
S'il te plaît.
D'accord, je déterrai
mes chaussures de danse.
Je sais que ça fait un moment,
ma chérie, mais...
Nous n'en avions pas même rêvé.
Nous voulions vous en faire la surprise.
Tu en es toujours pleine,
mais celle-ci est hors catégorie.
C'est pour ça que
tu n'es pas venue nous voir ?
Toutes ces visites annulées ?
Non, papa. Ne sois pas bête.
C'est à cause du travail.
Ce mystérieux travail.
Tout de même, Swansea
n'est pas sur une autre planète !
Tu aurais pu téléphoner, chérie.
Désolée.
Ne le sois pas, Gwen.
J'ai hâte de voir la tête
de la mère de Rhys !
C'est merveilleux, ton père n'en pouvait
plus d'attendre d'être grand-père.
J'ai passé toute la nuit d'hier
avec Rhys et ses amis.
Personne n'a mentionné
la grossesse de Gwen.
Rhys avait sûrement des ordres.
Gwen sait contrôler ses hommes !
Elle a été à bonne école.
Voilà les parents de Rhys.
- Brenda.
- Geraint.
- Barry.
- Bonjour.
Ravie de vous voir, Brenda.
Quelle belle tenue.
Superbe choix.
Et le vert vous va si bien.
- Enfin le grand jour.
- Comment va la mariée ?
Nous devrions vous parler
de quelque chose.
- Gwen !
- Ça ne va pas marcher, Rhys !
On n'a pas pensé à tout.
Et après le mariage ?
J'y ai pensé aussi.
Mes parents s'attendent à
devenir grands-parents.
Tes parents vont être excités,
ils vont prévoir des choses.
Je ne peux pas leur dire
que j'ai perdu le bébé.
Ils seraient dévastés.
On pourrait leur dire la vérité.
Sois pas bête, Rhys.
Les mensonges ne marchent pas, Gwen.
Tu te souviens ? Tu as essayé.
Tu penses que la vérité leur fera quoi ?
Nous avons vu ce qui traverse la brèche.
Je ne veux pas qu'ils vivent dans
la peur de ce qui vit dans les égouts.
Je suis désolée.
Oui, Jack.
Comment vas-tu ?
Pour l'instant, ça va.
Tosh ne va pas tarder à arriver.
<i>Appelle-ça un soutien moral.</i>
Je n'ai pas besoin d'une baby-sitter.
Passe-le-moi.
On a pas besoin de vous, Jack !
Vous en avez déjà fait assez comme ça.
Rendez-nous service et
ne vous mêlez pas de ça.
Je comprends, Rhys.
Félicitations quand même...
Ce n'est pas de sa faute.
C'est magnifique. Tu ne trouves pas ?
La grande classe. Tu devrais
prendre une brochure, Mervyn.
Au cas où tu trouves une fille
assez bourrée pour t'épouser.
Très drôle.
Il faudra plus qu'un hôtel chicos
pour me faire passer devant le prêtre.
Et voilà Mervyn le fou, Ministre du Son.
Duc de la Disco, Régent du Rock,
et Seigneur de l'Amour.
Comme tu veux, mec. Tu as besoin
d'aide pour la table et les lumières ?
Ouais...
Je pense avoir droit à un peu
de sandwich Mervyn, plus tard.
Vous vous en sortez, ma belle ?
Besoin d'aide ?
Non, merci. Ça va.
Vous assistez au mariage ?
Je suis une amie de Gwen.
Je suis Banana.
Je vous laisse deviner pourquoi.
Vous êtes plein de tâches
et ramollissez vite ?
Je suis le témoin.
L'évolution est pleine de surprises.
Je dois tout vérifier moi-même.
- Musique, gâteau, fleurs, placement.
- La suite de la mariée ?
Vous voulez prendre un verre, après ?
Désolée, je ne tolère pas les
amines vaso-actives.
Les bananes me font vomir.
Une telle beauté doit être
du côté de la mariée.
Je ne crois pas qu'ils font
ce style du côté de Rhys.
J'aime me faire remarquer.
Jack m'a fait apporter ça.
Elle est magnifique.
Et tu as raison d'avoir dit à Jack
et Owen que tu ne repousserais pas.
C'est merveilleux que tu te maries
quand même, quoi qu'il arrive.
Tosh, merci.
Tu as beaucoup de chance.
Tu sais, ça t'arrivera aussi, un jour.
Il y a toujours Owen.
Je ne crois pas.
"Pour le meilleur et pour le pire,
jusqu'à ce que la mort nous sépare."
Ça sonnerait un peu comme
une mauvaise blague.
Je te laisse t'habiller.
Je suis en bas si besoin.
- Bonne chance.
- Merci.
Non, j'aime celle-là. Bon choix.
J'ai estimé la taille de Gwen d'après
les scans du système de sécurité.
Mon père était un tailleur de génie.
Il estimait l'entrejambe d'un homme
dès qu'il passait le pas de la porte.
Ah, l'oeil familial.
Rappelle-moi de tester ça.
- Eh bien, si...
- Jack.
- Oui, j'adore celle-là.
- On a un problème.
Regarde ce que cachait notre ami.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Une glande protéus. L'organe de
changement de forme d'un Nostrovite.
- Et c'est quoi, exactement ?
- Des ennuis.
Beaucoup d'ennuis.
Aucune femme aussi belle
ne devrait assister à un mariage
sans fleur.
Mince. Désolé.
Je vous offre un autre verre ?
Vous ne préféreriez pas
manger un peu ?
Un autre spritzer, s'il vous plaît.
Oh mon dieu, c'est vrai !
Comment ça se fait ?
Doucement.
Je monte sur scène tout à l'heure.
Salut poupée. Si vous cherchez
ma chambre, elle est juste là.
C'est pas le cas.
Et ne m'appelez pas poupée.
Vous préférez quoi, beauté ?
Ne m'appelez pas du tout.
Ne dites rien.
Ne bougez pas.
Qu'avez-vous fait ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Tu as de la chance,
je surveille ma silhouette.
Mais je te garderais bien
pour le goûter.
Un Nostrovite est un changeur de forme
carnivore qui adore la chair humaine.
C'est intelligent et sournois...
J'aurais dû le savoir.
C'est le problème avec eux,
on ne sait jamais à quoi s'attendre.
Quel est le problème ? Il est mort.
Oui. Celui-là.
Il doit y en avoir plus ?
Les Nostrovites
s'accouplent pour une vie.
Comme les cygnes et les manchots.
Oui, sauf qu'on ne trouve pas de
Nostrovites sur des cartes postales.
Le mâle transporte les oeufs fertilisés
dans une poche dans sa bouche,
et les transmet à un hôte par morsure.
Gwen.
Et la mère intervient quand ?
Elle traque l'hôte et
lui arrache le ventre.
C'est la naissance d'un Nostrovite.
Et maman est en train de
chercher Gwen. Allons-y.
Vous allez bien ?
Oui, c'était juste une douleur.
Il doit faire gonfler ses muscles.
C'est pour bientôt.
Tosh ne répond pas.
Alors allons-y.
Tu es sûr de toi, Owen ?
Tu connais les Nostrovites.
Tu crois qu'il est à 30 m de toi,
alors qu'il te mastique déjà le foie.
J'ai pas besoin de mon foie.
Toi, tu as besoin de moi.
Le scalpel de singularité ?
Qu'est-ce que tu vas en faire ?
On doit trouver Gwen
avant le Nostrovite,
on retournera peut-être pas au QG et
le microtron pèse environ 2 tonnes.
Cette chose tue les gens.
- J'ai sauvé Martha avec.
- Coup de chance.
Ecoutez-moi.
Vous devez me faire confiance.
J'ai travaillé dessus et je le maîtrise.
Avec les Nostrovites,
on est à court d'options.
Il marque un point.
Qu'est-ce qui te prend ?
Depuis qu'il est mort, tu es
toujours d'accord avec lui.
On m'a toujours dit de ne
jamais dire du mal des morts.
Même s'ils parlent toujours.
OK, Owen. T'as intérêt
à savoir ce que tu fais.
Un costume de camouflage ?
Il me faut le numéro de sa couturière.
Gwen ne paraissait
pas enceinte hier soir.
On a vraiment dû trop boire.
Elle était en retard, non ?
On a sûrement abusé
avant qu'elle n'arrive.
Mais de là à ne pas voir
qu'elle était enceinte...
Superbe nuit...
On dirait un ange.
Maman, je suis désolée pour tout ça.
Gwen, c'est un bébé.
C'est un don de Dieu.
Tu seras une bonne épouse
et une mère merveilleuse.
Ton père et moi seront toujours
là pour toi et pour ton petit.
On se verra en bas.
Je t'aime.
Maman...
Je t'aime aussi.
On se dépêche, Geraint.
Et fais attention à ne pas te tâcher !
Gwen ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Je ne peux pas faire ça.
Je ne peux pas vous mentir.
Papa, ce bébé n'est pas de Rhys.
Toujours aucun signe de Banana Boat.
Ça ira, Papa.
Rhys, ta mère dit que ce mariage
devient un vrai cauchemar.
Comme si la soudaine grossesse
de Gwen n'était pas assez.
Tu es sûr que c'est le tien ?
Papa, je vais l'épouser !
J'aime Gwen,
chaque partie de moi l'aime.
Depuis la première fois que je l'ai vue.
Tu as aimé Cerys Morgan.
J'avais 12 ans !
Toujours pas de Banana Boat.
Allez-vous-en.
J'aimerais pouvoir.
Pas la peine, j'ai essayé.
On est bloqués.
J'arrive pas à y croire !
Vous pouvez au moins pousser
votre main ?
Plus loin !
S'il y a quelqu'un d'autre, que tu ne
veux pas te marier, c'est pas grave.
On trouvera une solution.
Il n'y a personne d'autre.
- Mais tu as dis...
- Ecoute-moi.
Cardiff est au centre d'une
brèche du temps et de l'espace.
Une quoi ?
Je travaille pour une organisation
qui contrôle ce qui en sort.
Qui sort d'où ?
D'autres planètes. D'autres dimensions.
Des extra-terrestres, papa.
Je te parle d'extra-terrestres.
C'est ce que je fais.
On s'appelle Torchwood.
On chasse les extra-terrestres
qui sortent de la brèche.
Oh, mon dieu.
L'un d'eux m'a mordu hier soir.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi,
mais je suis enceinte.
Rhys n'est pas le père.
C'est un extra-terrestre.
C'est un extra-terrestre.
La pauvre, ce mariage va l'épuiser.
Elle pense que son bébé
est un extra-terrestre.
- Quoi ?
- Ça ira.
Une fois la journée passée.
Gwen semble prendre son temps.
Tu te rappelles ce que c'est, Brenda.
La mariée aime faire son entrée.
Peut-être, mais je n'étais pas
en retard pour mon mariage.
Non. Barry serait sûrement parti.
Si elle revient, elle va nous tuer ?
Calmez-vous. J'ai des amis.
Ils nous trouveront.
Et sinon ?
Et si elle revient ?
On est son repas, non ?
A l'aide !
- La ferme !
- A l'aide !
Si elle nous entend, elle va revenir
et vous la fermer pour de bon !
A l'aide !
Ça suffit, à moins que vous
vouliez devenir castra.
Ça fait vraiment mal.
Amis et proches de Rhys et Gwen,
nous sommes réunis aujourd'hui pour
célébrer l'union de deux personnes
par les liens du mariage.
- C'est encore loin ?
- Quelques minutes.
Les gens font tout
un plat sur le mariage,
alors pourquoi faire tout ce
chemin vers un trou paumé
où personne ne peut vous
trouver, pour le faire ?
Pour moi c'est une grande contradiction.
Le joyeux petit couple
veut que tout soit parfait.
Un oeuf extra-terrestre dans le ventre,
et la mère qui vient pour l'arracher.
Oui, parfait.
Rhys et Gwen ont choisi de faire
ce serment devant vous.
Mais d'abord,
je me dois de vous demander
s'il quelqu'un dans l'assistance
s'oppose à cette union.
Arrêtez !
Arrêtez ! Arrêtez le mariage !
- Attendez !
- Jack ?
Gwen, crois-moi, je suis désolé.
Mais on doit arrêter ça.
Je savais que ce bébé
n'était pas de Rhys.
Qu'est-ce que vous foutez ici ?
Jack, je te l'ai dit, j'épouse Rhys !
Pas maintenant. Impossible.
Tirez-vous ! Vous avez déjà fait
assez de dégâts entre Gwen et moi.
Vous ne gâcherez pas notre mariage !
Ecoute, j'essaye de sauver
la vie de Gwen.
La tienne aussi.
Que se passe-t-il ?
J'ai un signal de Tosh.
Tosh ! Ça va aller ?
Sortez-moi de là !
Je suis Banana.
- Je dirais plus groseille.
- Owen.
Oh, mon dieu, c'est dégoûtant.
Sortons de là.
Ils étaient deux ?
Maman et Papa Nostrovite.
Ils chassent par deux. Mais la
naissance est plus un truc à trois.
Lui, trouve une hôte qu'il insémine.
Puis elle arrive,
telle la sage-femme de l'enfer.
Elle observe,
en attendant le bon moment.
Et puis ça devient moche.
Vous pensez qu'elle est dans le coin ?
Elle peut changer de forme, Rhys.
Elle pourrait être en bas à
discuter avec tes parents.
Tu penses que c'est vraiment fini ?
Un beau mec se pointe au mariage
et nous dit de garder nos confettis ?
Tu ferais quoi, tu épouserais Rhys ?
Alors c'est son bébé, non ?
Tu n'as pas vu le visage de Gwen
quand il est arrivé ?
Bref, je ferai bien de trouver Mervyn.
Lui dire de ne pas s'embêter à
sortir George Michael du camion.
On n'annule pas ce mariage.
Gwen, on n'a pas le choix.
Depuis que je t'ai rencontré,
Rhys a dû endurer tant de choses...
Mensonges. Dangers. Complications.
Mais il est toujours là.
Qui d'autre le serait encore ?
Qui d'autre m'épouserait
en sachant que je porte une
espèce de monstre en moi ?
Je l'aime et je vais l'épouser,
aujourd'hui.
Merci. Mais c'est aussi mon mariage.
J'ai pas mon mot à dire ?
Pile ce qu'il nous fallait.
Ianto, poursuis la fille,
ça ne doit pas se répandre.
Jack.
Oh mon dieu !
Je veux qu'on sorte Gwen de là !
Jack, j'ai vu sa dernière forme.
C'est une femme, en noir.
Vous savez ce qui se passe ?
Je suis dans le flou aussi, Brenda.
Le problème semble être un américain
au mauvais timing et mauvais goût.
Et votre fille !
Appelez la police !
On a tué Mervyn !
Jack, j'ai bien peur que
l'information ne se soit répandue.
OK. Retourne au SUV
et brouille les lignes téléphoniques.
<i>Il ne faut surtout pas que
quelqu'un appelle la police.</i>
Tosh, avec moi.
On doit trouver la femme en noir.
Gwen, Owen doit opérer maintenant.
Je veux Gwen hors de danger
tout de suite, Jack.
Moi aussi, Rhys.
Alors on m'écoute !
Rhys, Jack sait ce qu'il fait,
mon chéri.
Si on s'enfuit,
le Nostrovite nous attendra.
Et nous n'avons plus de temps.
Quel est ton plan ?
J'ai une idée.
Mais je reste là.
Bien. Tosh, avec moi.
Que se passe-t-il ?
J'avais du réseau tout à l'heure.
Pardon ! Gardez votre calme
et faites ce que je vous dis.
- Et qui êtes-vous ?
- Torchwood.
Le Torchwood de Gwen ?
Vous existez vraiment ?
- Jack, elle est là !
- Tout le monde à terre !
Oh mon dieu !
Bon sang, cette chose va vite.
Elle n'a pas dû aller bien loin.
Pas sans son butin.
Viens.
Ça ? Le scalpel de singularité ?
C'est ça, ton idée ?
Gwen, c'est bon, crois moi.
J'ai beaucoup travaillé dessus
depuis l'incident Mayfly.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Un appareil médical alien...
C'est ce que pense Owen.
Pense ?
- Rhys ? Tu es là ?
- C'est sa mère.
Maman.
Il y a un monstre, Rhys.
L'américain et la japonaise
sont partis à sa poursuite.
Restez là.
Jack, tout va bien ?
On l'a perdu.
Comment va la patiente ?
<i>Rhys et sa mère sont avec elle.</i>
Jack, la mère de Rhys est là !
Ce n'est pas le bébé de Rhys.
C'est un extra-terrestre.
Eloigne-toi d'elle, sale mochetée !
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
- C'est ma mère !
- Non.
- C'est l'extra-terrestre.
- Je ne suis pas un extra-terrestre.
Vous êtes convaincante,
je vous l'accorde.
Mais ce n'est pas vrai !
Oui, et le Lone Ranger
n'en pinçait pas pour Tonto.
Est-ce que le Nostrovite
copie les odeurs ?
Non, c'est juste physique.
Je reconnaîtrais cet horrible
parfum n'importe où.
C'est Brenda, Jack.
Voilà pour avoir traité
ma mère de sale mocheté !
Si c'est bien sa mère, qui est dehors ?
La voilà !
Le lien unissant une mère
et son enfant est merveilleux.
Lâchez-la.
- Votre mère contre mon enfant.
- Pas question.
Vous n'avez pas le choix.
Ne l'écoute pas, Gwen.
T'inquiète pas, maman.
Je vais faire attention à toi.
Elle ne va pas te tuer, ça va aller.
Tu ne peux pas faire ça.
C'est ma mère, Rhys.
Ça va aller.
Ça va aller, maman.
Reste calme, ne bouge pas.
Viens voir maman !
Voilà le genre de fille
dont toute mère doit rêver.
Froide comme la glace,
à vider un automatique.
Gwen m'avait parlé de vous,
mais je ne l'ai pas crue.
Ça va revenir. Owen, prépare Gwen.
Je veux qu'on en finisse.
Gwen, j'arrive tout de suite.
Je dois parler à Rhys.
- De quoi ?
- Tout et rien. Fais-moi confiance.
Quoi ?
Ecoute, Rhys.
Le scalpel de singularité...
La dernière fois que je m'en suis
servi, j'avais deux bonnes mains.
Donc tu ne peux plus t'en servir ?
Tu préférerais que la personne
qui a la vie de Gwen entre ses mains
puisse compter sur les deux.
Je peux demander à Jack.
Non, montre-moi comment faire.
C'est assez intuitif.
Salut, Jack.
Pas vraiment la mariée parfaite...
Mais je n'attends plus que tout
se passe bien depuis longtemps.
Si la vie était sans aucune surprise,
quel serait l'intérêt de la vivre ?
Je ne m'attendais pas à
rencontrer quelqu'un comme toi.
Sans ça, je serais déjà mariée.
Tu n'es pas la seule à avoir rencontré
quelqu'un qui a changé sa vie.
Rhys a toujours été là pour moi.
A travers toute cette folie, même
quand je ne le méritais pas.
Il n'a pas peur de me dire qu'il m'aime.
Gwen !
Sors de là !
Vas-y, rends-moi service !
Ça va ?
Je cours partout en robe de mariée,
avec un tonneau de bière sous la jupe.
A ton avis ?
Allez.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Baisse ça, Owen.
Elle a senti que j'étais périmé.
- Où sont Gwen et Rhys ?
- Ils se sont enfuis.
J'ai vidé une cartouche sur
cette chose, tout comme Gwen.
Mais l'instinct maternel rend
cette vache invincible.
Nos armes ne marchent pas.
Il va nous en falloir une plus grosse.
Rhys, je n'en peux plus !
- Elle est là !
- Elle va nous entendre.
Je crois que ça n'a pas d'importance.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous avec ça ?
Owen m'a montré comment l'utiliser.
Vas-y ! Fais-le !
D'accord.
C'est bon.
Je t'aime... Je t'aime vraiment.
Gwen !
Eloigne-toi, Rhys!
Donnez-moi mon enfant
et vous n'aurez rien.
C'est trop tard !
Et j'en ai vraiment assez de toi !
Tu mets ma copine enceinte.
Tu prends l'apparence de ma mère
et tu gâches mon mariage !
Merde !
Rhys, tu es un vilain garçon.
Et tu sais ce qu'on leur fait ?
Pas mal, comme changement de forme.
Jack !
Le style recouvert d'alien mort
te va plutôt bien, Rhys.
- Ça va ?
- Oui.
Et...
Le héros finit toujours avec la fille.
Je suis désolée.
J'ai vraiment tout gâché.
Tu veux toujours m'épouser ?
J'appelle les
personnes ici présentes
à être témoin du fait que moi,
Gwen Elizabeth Cooper
Te prends toi, Rhys Alun Williams,
comme légitime époux.
Te prends toi, Rhys Alun Williams,
comme légitime époux.
Viens là.
Prête pour la danse du mort, Tosh ?
Allez.
Je peux ?
Pourquoi pas ? Je n'ai plus de pieds.
Je vais me trouver une bière.
Profite bien de ta lune de miel.
Sans problème.
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire
pendant ce temps ?
Comme d'habitude.
Pizza, Ianto...
Sauver le monde quelques fois.
Je vais te manquer ?
Toujours.
Rhys a de la chance,
c'est un mari parfait.
Il est loyal, courageux.
Il a un sacré swing !
Et le plus important,
il t'aime vraiment.
Je sais.
Je peux... ?
Oui.
Et voilà.
Merci.
On dirait pas qu'ils ont failli se
faire déchirer par une alien névrosée.
Ça a été un peu trop
pour ma mère et Brenda.
Je n'aurais jamais pensé voir ça.
Jack, que se passe-t-il ?
C'est le truc quand on mélange des
pilules d'amnésie avec du champagne.
Ça donne un coup de boost à la soirée
et puis tout le monde s'endort.
Tu as effacé leurs mémoires ?
C'est sûrement mieux comme ça.
Je ne veux pas que ma mère
se souvienne d'aujourd'hui.
Les heureux mariés ne devraient
peut-être pas non plus.
Non merci.
Ce mariage n'aura aucun secret.
C'est l'heure d'y aller.
On se revoit après la lune de miel.
Restez hors de danger.
Merci pour la robe.
Elle était magnifique.
Quelque chose me dit
qu'on est pas prêts de se coucher.
C'est vrai. Ça a été une dure journée,
mais elle n'est pas encore finie.
Il y a beaucoup à faire.
Grosse opération de nettoyage.
Et faites de votre mieux.
N'oubliez pas, c'est le mariage de Gwen.
C'est pour ça que j'aime Torchwood.
La journée, tu chasses
la pourriture de l'univers.
Passé minuit, tu te transformes
en fée du mariage.

C'est plus qu'un simple cinéma.
C'est l'Electro.
Une soirée qu'on ne vit qu'une fois.
Pourquoi ne pas entrer ?
Je viens de voir Jack !
Il est une de ces bêtes de foire.
Les voyageurs de la nuit,
ils existaient bien.
Ils ne se représentaient
qu'au beau milieu de la nuit.
Alors deux personnes d'un film
ont décidé d'aller se promener ?
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
- Sa bouche a été desséchée.
Qu'est-ce qu'ils fabriquent ?
Il est temps d'amener les autres.
Par ici, s'il vous plaît.

Torchwood.
Outside the Government,
beyond the police.
Fighting for the future
on behalf of the human race.
The 21st century
is when everything changes,
and Torchwood is ready.
Ladies and gentlemen,
girls and boys,
have we got a show
for you tonight!
A once in a lifetime show.
Amaze your ears,
astonish your eyes,
then run along home and
tell your friends and neighbours.
A once in a lifetime show,
never to be forgotten
for the rest of your lives.
So, why not step inside?
We're waiting for you.
Great!
What is that?
I know where you came from, mate,
I know where you're going.
Tosh?
I heard this sound.
An old sound, like a pipe organ.
A what?
Did you hear anything?
No.
Is there a circus in town,
or a travelling fair,
something like that?
On a night like this?
They'd be wasting their time.
Where's Ianto? He'd know.
He's gone to the cinema
with Gwen and Owen,
some kind of opening night
he wanted to check out.
The building's got
a record of rift activity
but it's been quiet for years so...
A nice trip to the cinema, you said.
Yeah, that's right.
Ianto, nothing down here, mate.
Oh, come on, Owen.
It's more than just a cinema.
It's the Electro!
Oh, wow!
Where's that stupid
bloody son of ours?
He said he'd be here on time.
He'd better be. He's got the film.
And what good
is a cinema without a film?
Good evening, gentlemen.
Evening, madam.
Welcome to the Electro.
I love this place.
Used to come here with my dad.
They'd show kids' films
on Saturday morning.
So where's the popcorn
and the ice cream?
I think you've missed out.
It's educational. OK.
Come on.
What time do you call this?
Sorry. People are waiting.
You won't believe this,
but when I was splicing the film...
Just get up to
that projection room.
Now!
MUFFLED ORGAN MUSIC
As proud owners of the Electro
museum, it is our privilege
to be able to show you
how the cinema and Hope Street
looked in days gone by.
If you watch carefully, who knows?
You may even see long-dead
members of your family
waiting in the cinema queue.
Bernard!
JAUNTY PIANO MUSIC
Do you recognise any of
your long-lost relatives, Gwen?
There's Aunty Peggy. She's been on
the gin. Can you be quiet?
He's showing the wrong bloody film!
Where's Hope Street gone?
Oh, shit!
Where the hell
did that film come from?
I've no idea. I swear I didn't edit
those clips. Don't be stupid.
It's true.
Just bloody well change it. I can't.
The machine won't switch off.
Oh, get out of the way.
This is crazy!
It's the same pictures
over and over again.
Yeah.
Come on, let's go.
Wait!
I just saw Jack. Where?
In the film.
What are you talking about? What?
I swear I saw him.
Ianto... Wait. just wait.
Come on.
Let's go. Yes, come on.
Are you coming?
When the film stopped,
these shadows went past me.
What kind of shadows?
I don't know. It wasn't clear.
There was something else.
You were up there on the screen.
As large as life.
What was I doing?
You were on some sort of stage.
Outside a big tent.
You seemed to be part
of a travelling show.
I heard it.
Heard its music.
Just a snatch of it.
That film was beautiful.
All those acts performing for us.
Part of history,
trapped on film forever.
Their days were numbered.
Cinema may have
saved their images,
but it finished off
the travelling shows.
Killed them.
I'm at the bus stop, Mum.
By Hope Street.
No. Gemma's brother
couldn't bring me home.
His car don't work.
Well, what about Dad?
Can't you wake him? Mum?
Would you like a ticket
for the travelling show, my dear?
No, thanks.
Every young person's dream.
Perhaps she'd like
to join the show instead.
Why not? You could travel with us.
Forever.
Look, just go away, will you?
Did you hear what I said?
SHE STRUGGLES FOR BREATH
So you say
the projector went haywire?
Yeah, even with the mains
switched off it still kept running.
Playing those film clips.
It's like it had a mind of its own.
Working now. I know.
Where did you get these? The
basement. There were stacks of cans.
I've been compiling old footage
of Hope Street and the Electro
for the opening night.
But the circus clips weren't on it.
I swear.
The film that was shown wasn't meant
to be here?
No, and that's what's so scary.
I mean, it kind of played itself.
It's like it wanted to be seen.
Like something tried to get through?
Yeah. And there was a sound,
like old fashioned music.
Played on an organ or something.
And there was a face
looking out at me.
And there was a smell, like...
Like bromine. Or iodine.
Like film itself. That's right.
And this is the film?
Yeah.
TOSH: 'Jack, the systems
here are behaving very oddly.'
And I heard the sound you mentioned.
That fairground sound.
Can you trace the source?
No. But there was a peak
in rift activity at the Electro.
'Then nothing. Plus I'm recording
unusual rift traces nearby.'
Where? 'Chain Lane.'
Runs parallel to Hope Street.
Sending the co-ordinates now.
DISTANT SIRENS
Tosh, we're on our way. Tell
the police we're dealing with it.
Epileptic maybe?
Could be wearing a tag.
She isn't.
She got ID?
I'll check. What's wrong?
She's got a heartbeat
but she isn't breathing.
Shouldn't really be alive.
And look at her mouth.
She's got no saliva. Look, her
lips are cracked. Dry as a bone.
We need to get her to hospital.
Sorry. We're closed.
Do you hear me? We're closed.
Make her cry. You what?
I want to drink her tears.
SHE STRUGGLES FOR BREATH
SIRENS WAIL
The name's Nettie Williams.
Her parents are outside.
She was visiting a friend.
Have any witnesses come forward? No.
Has anyone been able
to communicate with her?
No. No change in her condition.
Motor response? Non-existent,
they're treating it as a coma.
And they're wrong?
Totally. There's no signs
of cerebral dysfunctions,
no symptoms of hypoxia.
And her body's dehydrated.
You know when a spider sucks
the liquid out of its victims?
Well, this is a bit like that,
except they've
left her partly alive.
She couldn't cry about it even
if she wanted to, the poor kid.
She's got no tears.
There's been another one.
Who's she?
We don't know. The paramedics
found her. It freaked them.
She was lying in an open doorway.
Looking like this.
Where was this?
The corner of Hope Street.
The same. Heartbeat but no breath.
Her mouth's been drained
of moisture.
This makes no sense, they're almost
dehydrated and possibly brain dead
yet somehow they're still with us.
Some part of them
has been taken elsewhere?
That's impossible.
For the body to be alive there
must be a life force somewhere.
Yet they've separated it, stolen it.
Who has the power to do that?
I don't know.
But we need to find out fast.
Two people chosen at random.
Who's next?
Whatever's doing it
has the whole city to choose from.
Or the world.
I knew those two.
They argued day and night.
That is you.
All right, now I've seen everything!
I told you so. You did stand-up?
I never did stand-up.
OK, then. A song and dance.
I was sensational!
I don't believe this, Jack.
What were you doing there?
He was part of the freak show.
Some things never change.
Are you being rude about me?
Look at the state of them.
I do love his leotard.
The night travellers. The what?
Tosh, play that back.
So, they did exist.
Did you work with these people?
I didn't work with them,
I never knew anyone who did.
They only performed
in the dead of night.
Anyway, it was just a tale
that was around at that time.
A ghost story.
They came from out of the rain.
That's how people described them.
Jack, what did these
night travellers do?
Left a trail of damage and sorrow
wherever they performed.
Tosh, can you run this
frame by frame? Er, sure.
What are you looking for?
I'm not sure.
But something's wrong.
Something's missing.
This must be back, now, yeah?
80 odd years.
Then the travelling shows
faded away.
No-one came to watch them and
without an audience they died out.
Forgotten.
Until all we have to remember them
by were these film clips.
Jack!
This film. It's not the same one
we saw at the cinema.
Course it's the same one.
No, things are different. Tosh...
Easy to miss at first, but after
watching it a few times I realised.
Just there. There was a woman
in front of that water tank.
Yeah there was, Ianto, you're right.
That's right, I remember her.
Wearing almost nothing.
And there was a man in like
a top hat, a sort of MC.
Yeah. That's right. He was
reaching down to the audience.
Are you sure you brought
the right can of film back?
Positive. So what are we saying?
That two people from a piece of film
have decided to go AWOL?
Yeah.
Like you said,
trapped in film forever.
When they opened the cinema,
it gave them a chance.
When that kid ran the film,
he let them loose.
So they've become physical?
They've escaped the film?
We need to find out more about
the havoc they caused in the past.
We need evidence.
Possible witnesses.
After all that time it'll be tricky.
What, town and parish records?
Sure, we can do that. How far back do
you want us to go?
As far as you can.
We don't sleep till we find them.
Toshiko, keep checking
for sightings.
There's got to be a way
of tracing them. Ianto, with me,
I need your local knowledge.
Oh, is that what
you're calling it these days?
So, two people who should
have been dead for years.
What kind of creatures are they?
No-one ever knew
the night travellers were coming.
They'd just appear from nowhere.
Not like the team I was with.
We'd send out flyers,
bang drums, blow whistles.
Ours was a small company.
Working the UK.
Trying to find paying customers.
I was sent to investigate rumours
of the night travellers.
By who?
Long story.
So I joined a travelling show.
I was billed as
the man who couldn't die.
The night travellers
always found an audience.
They knew where to look.
Step along now,
ladies and gentlemen,
come and see
the show of a lifetime!
Fill your eyes
with the spectacle
of the tattooed man!
Witness for yourself
the superhuman strength
of the Mighty Stromboli!
He can take on
Samson, Goliath and Hercules
with one arm
tied behind his back,
and still have strength
to dig their graves.
Come along now,
ladies and gentlemen,
the night won't wait forever.
Come and see the amazing Pearl!
She lives in water.
She sleeps among the waves.
She can reach
the bottom of the oceans.
She has swum the seven seas.
She is the nearest thing
that you will ever see
to a living mermaid.
She will take your breath away.
How many other old cinemas
are there in Cardiff?
Most of them have been pulled down.
And the ones that are left?
Converted.
This one is a pub.
Four-pint jugs for a fiver
and girls in free before 11.
I'm registering the sea!
The sea? Inland?
Running through the centre of town?
TYRES SCREECH
What is it?
I thought...
I thought I saw something.
Saw what?
Ghosts.
Don't be stupid.
SHE SCREAMS
So the Electro is the only one left.
Could the night travellers
have performed there? Possibly.
If cinema killed
the travelling show, maybe
this is their way of fighting back.
Their only chance to escape
before every old movie theatre
and piece of film has gone.
What better way to get revenge?
They were left forgotten,
on pieces of film.
And now they're looking
for a new audience.
What is it, Tosh?
She was picking up the sea.
In the middle of town.
It's gone now.
I was getting the sound of waves.
Seagulls.
I could almost smell the ozone.
No other sightings? No.
What the hell are they up to?
I like the lights.
They make the rain glisten.
And they're part of us.
EERIE BREATHS
Smell the water.
Taste it.
Careful.
How many now? Six.
I wish I could see the air
they once breathed.
You know you can never see it.
We could never see it.
We have their ghosts here.
I can see them whenever I want.
Our audience.
They'll never leave us.
We can't see. But we can hear.
Listen.
EERIE BREATHS AGAIN
I can!
I can hear them.
Little last breaths,
still sighing their sighs.
Can we bring the others?
Make ghosts forever?
The others shouldn't be
in some old dark cupboard.
They should be here with us.
And I want to travel again, perform.
All right.
But first we need
the rest of that film.
Found in a car with their parents,
near Hope Street.
Oh, no.
What happened to the parents?
They're in the same cataleptic state.
They came from out of the rain.
What did you say?
Nothing. Why?
Those words, 'From out of the rain'.
I'm sure I've heard them before.
Oh, I remember, it was Christina.
She was a patient.
Here? No, at Providence Park,
it's a psychiatric hospital.
I know it.
I used to work there.
She was a full-time patient,
been there since she was a child.
She was a strange one.
Whenever anything, any kind
of entertainment show was laid on,
she became scared.
She'd run away and hide.
Did she say why?
Yes. She said they were coming
to steal her last breath.
Poor love.
I think we've just found
ourselves our first witness.
They came from out of the rain.
At night. Came to the village.
How old were you at the time?
Oh, just a child.
Five, I think, or six.
Are you visiting someone?
Christina, we've come to see you.
No one comes to see me.
Your eyes are older than your face.
Is that a bad thing? Yes.
It means you don't belong.
It means you're from nowhere.
Christina, tell us about them.
The people who came out of the rain.
There was music. Hurdy-gurdy music.
Acrobats.
And a man with fire in his hands.
Who else was there?
A man in dark clothes,
and a woman. A beautiful young
woman in a silvery costume.
She seemed to glisten.
They touched you, I can sense it.
They touched you
as they passed you by.
Tell us about the man, Christina.
Oh. He spoke to me.
He asked if I would like to
join the travelling show.
He took a kind of flask
out of his pocket.
It was polished like silver.
I asked him his name.
Oh, I shall never forget it.
I never shall.
He said he was the ghost maker.
He wanted to take my breath
and put it in his flask.
He said I could travel
with his circus,
I would be in his audience forever.
I turned and ran away
as fast as I could.
People went missing from the village
that night.
My mother,
my father...
Here we go. Church Stretton, 1901.
People went missing when a
travelling show visited the town,
and there was one earlier on.
1898, a small village
called Wellsfield.
These disappearances,
there's a lot of old wives' tales
attached to them through the years.
People still alive but
been deprived of breath,
children being told to hold
their breath while the
travelling show passes by.
Yeah, this local paper,
didn't take it seriously.
Hunstanton Chronicle, March 1911.
"Police and doctors were left
amused and baffled when
Mr Alfred Mace insisted
that his dead wife could be brought
back to life providing a certain
flask could be found."
He reckoned his wife's last breath
had been put in a flask.
A silver flask.
And the last breath of each victim.
So that's how he makes his ghosts.
So if we find the flask...
We can save them.
Now we have the film.
Time to bring the others.
Jack, this is Jonathan,
they're here, they're at my flat,
you've got to get over here now!
Who was in there?
A woman, lying under water.
I thought she'd drowned.
Anyone else? No.
Be careful.
PIANO PLAYS IN DISTANCE
Did Bernard say he
was coming here today?
No.
PIANO PLAYS
David...
This way, please.
So they haven't left the area.
They probably can't.
Probably need to be near
the Electro.
All my old film cans have
been opened. What was on them?
Clips from circus sideshows.
They're bringing more through.
Then we need to stop them.
Gwen, Owen. Meet us at the Electro.
Look, what's going on?
I've got to find my Mum and Dad.
If anything's happened to them...
Hey, there's that smell again.
Like chemicals.
Yeah, I can smell it.
Like when you develop a film.
That woman.
She grabbed me.
But her hand, it was different.
It wasn't like a hand.
It wasn't like flesh.
It was it was like touching a piece
of plastic, a piece of celluloid.
They were on this film for 80 years.
Became part of it.
What if we filmed them?
A film of a film?
Yeah.
Then they'd be trapped.
Is this thing loaded?
If they were trapped
on film before...
They can be got rid
of in the same way.
Let's suppose they're made of
camphor and nitrate,
made of shadows, made of light.
Just enough light. We film them.
Capture them in that...
Then expose the film to as much
light as possible. Of course.
We'd blank them out, we'd lose them.
Let's hope so. Jack?
Yeah? We're at the Electro.
Something's happening inside.
Let's go.
PIANO PLAYS
Do you hear that?
Maybe it's my mam and dad.
Would they lock themselves in? No.
Please let them be OK. Please.
Mum? Dad? Take it easy...
What's going on? Mum?
No, Jonathan. Mum!
Dad!
What's happened?
Please!
Don't die, please! Speak to me!
No! Leave me alone!
They've been frozen in place,
a circus needs an audience.
ORGAN MUSIC STARTS UP
Get him out of here.
Jonathan, come on. Leave me alone.
Owen, find out who's upstairs.
The same pictures as before.
Jack.
They're coming through...
Open up!
We've done it. We're together again.
This place is ours. It belongs to us.
This whole city belongs to us!
What are you? There's not a
breath in your poor, sad body.
You're no use to me.
The flask! He's got it!
I've got it!
Gwen, are you all right? Oh!
Yeah. Are you OK? Yes!
Owen, look after the family.
Argh!
No! Please!
If their breaths escaped the
flask all the victims will die.
WOMAN SCREAMS
Quick! We could lose them forever!
They're flat-lining,
call the crash team.
One.
I think we saved just one.
EERIE BREATHS
I hear it, Jack.
I heard it,
something inside calling out to me.
So we managed to save one.
But which one?
There was nothing we could do.
They all died so suddenly.
Except this poor little soul.
I suppose he'll be next to go.
What are you doing?
I need your help.
What is that thing? Please.
Just trust me. Give me a hand.
Careful.
Hold his head. What's in there?
Something that belongs to him.
His last breath,
his life.
What have you done to him?
It worked.
Welcome back.
Those reels of film in
Jonathan's workroom...
I took them out, destroyed them.
Let's hope that's an end to it.
What worries me are all those
long lost pieces of film,
tucked away in dusty cellars,
hidden in lofts.
The night travellers could
still be there, somewhere.
Just waiting.
How much is this?
EERIE BREATHS
Jonah Bevan. Disappeared walking
home from football practice.
Why is this one so special?
Something's glowing, just out
of the camera's line of sight.
Cardiff has an epidemic of
missing persons. Oh, my God.
I'll make it my own special project.
No, leave it alone... I can't.
He's got to be out there somewhere.
Can we keep this to ourselves?
You're covering it up,
in the Bristol Channel?
What if the rift doesn't just leave
stuff behind? What if it also takes?
What's your mate doing there?
Any reason you'd be on the barrage
that night? Close this down!

Super !
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Je sais pas d'où tu sors,
mais je sais où tu vas finir.
Tosh ?
J'ai entendu cet air.
Ce vieil air, comme
celui des grandes orgues.
Un quoi ?
Tu as entendu quelque chose ?
Non.
Il y a un cirque en ville
ou une fête foraine ?
Par une nuit pareille ?
Ils perdraient leur temps.
Où est Ianto ? Il doit savoir.
Il est au cinéma avec Gwen et Owen.
Une soirée d'ouverture
qu'il voulait voir.
Des activités de la brèche y ont déjà
eu lieu mais rien depuis des années.
Une balade sympa jusqu'au
cinéma, disais-tu.
Oui.
Ianto, y'a rien à voir ici.
- Arrête Owen.
- C'est plus qu'un simple cinéma.
C'est l'Electro !
Où est notre stupide fils ?
- Il a dit qu'il serait à l'heure.
- Il a intérêt. Il a le film.
A quoi sert un cinéma sans film ?
Bonsoir Messieurs. Madame.
Bienvenue à l'Electro.
J'adore cet endroit.
J'y venais avec mon père.
Ils passaient des films pour
enfants le samedi matin.
Où sont le pop-corn et les glaces ?
On dirait que tu as oublié.
C'est éducatif.
Tu crois que c'est une heure ?
Les gens attendent.
Tu ne vas jamais le croire, mais
quand je préparais le film...
Dépêche-toi d'aller en
salle de projection !
Maintenant !
En tant que fiers propriétaires du
musée de l'Electro, nous avons l'honneur
de vous présenter Hope Street et ce
cinéma tels qu'ils étaient auparavant.
Si vous observez bien, qui sait ?
Peut-être reconnaîtrez-vous des membres
de votre famille faisant la queue.
Bernard !
Tu reconnais des proches, Gwen ?
- Voilà tante Peggy. Elle et son gin.
- Vous pouvez vous calmer ?
Il passe le mauvais film !
Où est passé Hope Street ?
Oh, merde !
Bon sang, d'où vient ce film ?
- Aucune idée. C'est pas ma faute.
- Ne sois pas stupide.
- C'est vrai.
- Change-le !
- La machine ne veut pas s'éteindre.
- Pousse-toi de là.
C'est fou !
C'est toujours les mêmes images.
Oui.
Bon, on y va.
Attendez !
- J'ai vu Jack.
- Où ?
Dans le film.
- De quoi tu parles ?
- Je te jure, je l'ai vu.
- Ianto !
- Attendez.
Allez.
On y va.
Tu viens ?
Quand le film s'est arrêté,
ces ombres m'ont dépassé.
Quel genre d'ombres ?
Je ne sais pas. Ce n'était pas clair.
Il y avait autre chose.
Tu étais dans le film.
En chair et en os.
Qu'est-ce que je faisais ?
Tu étais sur une scène.
A l'extérieur d'une grande tente.
Apparemment, tu faisais partie
d'une troupe itinérante.
Je l'ai entendue.
J'ai entendu sa musique.
Juste un écho.
Ce film était beau.
Tous ces actes réalisés pour nous.
Une partie de l'Histoire,
piégée sur film pour toujours.
Leurs jours étaient comptés.
Le cinéma a peut-être
sauvé leurs images,
mais il a mis fin
aux troupes itinérantes.
Il les a tués.
Je suis à l'arrêt de bus, maman.
Près de Hope Street.
Non. Le frère de Gemma
ne pouvait pas me ramener.
Sa voiture est en panne.
Et papa ?
Tu ne peux pas le réveiller ? Maman ?
Veux-tu un ticket pour
le cirque, ma chère ?
- Non merci.
- Toutes les jeunes personnes en rêvent.
Peut-être préférerait-elle
rejoindre la troupe ?
Pourquoi pas ?
Tu pourrais voyager avec nous.
- Pour toujours.
- Partez, vous voulez bien ?
Vous avez entendu ?
Tu dis que le projecteur
s'est détraqué ?
Oui, même avec les moteurs éteints,
ça continuait.
Il jouait ces vieux bouts de film.
Comme s'ils avaient leur propre âme.
- Ça marche maintenant.
- Je sais.
- Où as-tu trouvé ça ?
- A la cave. Il y en a des piles.
J'ai réuni des images d'Hope Street
et de l'Electro pour l'ouverture.
Mais les images du cirque
n'y étaient pas. Je le jure.
Les images diffusées
n'était pas supposées y être ?
Non, et c'est ce qui est effrayant.
Elles se sont jouées toutes seules.
Comme si elles voulaient êtres vues.
Et que quelque chose voulait en sortir.
Oui. Et il y avait cet air,
comme une vieille musique.
Jouée sur un orgue.
Ce visage qui me fixait.
Cette odeur, comme...
De la brome. Ou de l'iode.
- Comme le film lui-même.
- C'est ça.
C'est le film ?
Oui.
<i>Jack, les systèmes se
comportent très bizarrement.</i>
Et j'ai entendu le son dont tu
m'as parlé. Cette musique de foire.
Tu peux trouver la source ?
Non. Mais il y a eu un pic
d'activité de la brèche à l'Electro.
<i>Et puis plus rien. Et j'enregistre des
traces étranges de la brèche non loin.</i>
- Où ça ?
- Chain Lane.
Rue parallèle à Hope Street.
Je t'envoie les coordonnées.
<i>Tosh, on est sur le chemin.
Préviens la police qu'on s'en occupe.</i>
Epileptique ?
Elle a peut-être un bracelet.
Non.
Elle a des papiers ?
- Je vais vérifier.
- Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Elle a un pouls mais
elle ne respire pas.
Elle ne devrait pas être en vie.
Regarde sa bouche.
Elle n'a pas de salive. Ses lèvres
sont fendues. Sèches comme du bois.
On doit l'amener à l'hôpital.
Désolée. C'est fermé.
Vous m'avez entendu ? C'est fermé.
- Fais-la pleurer.
- Quoi ?
Je veux boire ses larmes.
Elle s'appelle Nettie Williams.
Ses parents sont dehors.
- Elle était chez une amie.
- Aucun témoin ?
- Non.
Quelqu'un a pu communiquer avec elle ?
Non. Aucun changement dans son état.
- Réponses moteur ?
- Non, il le traite comme un coma.
Et ils ont tort ?
Complètement.
Aucun signe de dysfonctionnement
cérébral ou d'hypoxie.
Et son corps est déshydraté.
Tu vois, quand une araignée absorbe
le liquide de ses victimes ?
C'est un peu comme ça, sauf qu'ils
l'ont laissée en partie en vie.
Elle ne pourrait pas pleurer même
si elle le voulait, la pauvre.
Elle n'a pas de larmes.
Il y en a eu une autre.
Qui est-ce ?
On ne sait pas.
Les ambulanciers l'ont trouvée.
Ça les a effrayés.
Elle était étendue comme ça
devant une porte ouverte.
C'était où ?
Au coin de Hope Street.
Même chose.
Un pouls mais pas de respiration.
Sa bouche a été drainée.
Ça n'a aucun sens, elles sont
déshydratées et presque mortes
et pourtant elles sont toujours en vie.
Une partie d'elles se
trouve peut-être ailleurs ?
C'est impossible.
Pour que le corps soit en vie, il doit
y avoir une force de vie quelque part.
- Mais ils l'ont séparée du corps, volée.
- Qui a le pouvoir de faire ça ?
Je ne sais pas.
Mais on doit le découvrir vite.
Deux personnes choisies au hasard.
A qui le tour ?
En tout cas, ce qui fait ça
peut choisir dans toute la ville.
Ou le monde.
Je connaissais ces deux là.
Ils se disputaient jour et nuit.
C'est toi !
- OK, maintenant j'ai tout vu !
- Je te l'avais dit.
Tu faisais du stand-up ?
- Non, j'ai jamais fait de stand-up.
- OK, tu chantais et dansais.
J'étais sensationnel !
Je n'y crois pas, Jack.
Qu'est-ce que tu faisais là ?
C'était une de ces bêtes de foire.
Certaines choses ne changent jamais.
C'est pour moi, ça ?
Regarde dans quel état ils sont.
Mais j'adore son justaucorps.
- Les voyageurs de la nuit.
- Les quoi ?
Tosh, reviens en arrière.
- Ils existaient vraiment.
- Tu as travaillé avec eux ?
Je n'ai jamais travaillé avec eux.
Et je ne connais personne
qui l'ait fait.
Ils ne se produisaient
qu'au beau milieu de la nuit.
Enfin, ce n'était qu'une
légende de l'époque.
Une histoire de fantômes.
Ils sortaient de la pluie.
C'est ce que disaient les gens.
Jack, que faisaient ces
voyageurs de la nuit ?
Ils laissaient dégâts et
peine partout où ils passaient.
Tosh, tu peux le faire
tourner image par image ?
Euh... Bien sûr
- Tu cherches quoi ?
- Je ne sais pas trop.
Mais quelque chose ne va pas.
Il manque quelque chose.
- Ça remonte à des années, non ?
- 80 ans.
Puis les troupes itinérantes
ont disparues.
Plus personne ne venait les
voir, ils ont donc péri. Oubliés.
Jusqu'à ce que notre seul souvenir
d'eux soit ces bouts de film.
Ce film, ce n'est pas
le même qu'au cinéma.
- Bien sûr que si.
- Non, il y a des différences.
Ça passe inaperçu, mais après
plusieurs visionnages je l'ai vu.
Juste là. Il y avait une
femme devant cette cuve d'eau.
Oui, tu as raison.
Oui, je m'en souviens.
Elle ne portait presque rien.
Et il y avait un homme avec un chapeau
haut de forme, un Monsieur Loyal.
Oui. Il interpellait les passants.
Tu es sûr d'avoir ramené le bon film ?
- Sûr.
- Alors quoi ?
Deux personnes d'un bout de film
ont décidé d'aller se promener ?
Oui.
Comme tu l'as dit,
piégés sur film pour toujours.
Quand ils ont ouvert le cinéma,
ça leur a donné une chance.
Quand ce gamin a fait tourner
le film, il les a libérés.
Ils sont devenus réels ?
Ils se sont échappés du film ?
Il faut qu'on en sache plus sur le
grabuge qu'ils ont fait à l'époque.
Il nous faut des preuves.
Des témoins potentiels.
Après autant de temps, ça va être dur.
Archives des villes et paroisses ?
On peut faire ça.
On remonte jusqu'à quand ?
Aussi loin que possible.
Pas de repos tant
qu'ils sont en liberté.
Toshiko, surveille
si quelqu'un les aperçoit.
Il doit y avoir un moyen de les trouver.
Ianto, j'ai besoin de
ta connaissance du coin.
C'est comme ça que ça
s'appelle, maintenant ?
Deux personnes qui devraient
être mortes depuis des années.
Quel genre de créatures sont-ils ?
Personne ne savait jamais quand
les voyageurs de la nuit venaient.
Ils sortaient de nulle part.
Pas comme la troupe avec qui j'étais.
On envoyait des tracts,
on tambourinait, on sifflait.
On était une petite troupe.
Parcourant le Royaume-Uni.
Essayant de trouver des clients.
On m'avait envoyé enquêter sur
les rumeurs des voyageurs de la nuit.
Par qui ?
Longue histoire.
J'ai rejoint une troupe itinérante.
J'étais présenté comme l'homme
qui ne pouvait mourir.
Les voyageurs de la nuit
trouvaient toujours un public.
Ils savaient où chercher.
Rapprochez-vous,
Mesdames et Messieurs !
Venez voir un spectacle
qu'on ne vit qu'une fois !
Emerveillez-vous
devant le spectacle
de l'homme tatoué !
Soyez témoins
de la force surnaturelle
du Puissant Stromboli !
Il peut rivaliser contre
Samson, Goliath et Hercules
avec un bras attaché dans le dos,
et trouver encore la force
de creuser leur tombe.
Rapprochez-vous,
Mesdames et Messieurs.
La nuit ne durera pas éternellement.
Venez voir la merveilleuse Perle !
Elle vit dans l'eau.
Elle dort parmi les vagues.
Elle peut atteindre les
profondeurs des océans.
Elle a parcouru les sept mers.
Elle est ce qui ressemble le plus
à une sirène vivante.
Elle vous coupera le souffle.
Combien de vieux cinémas
restent-ils à Cardiff ?
La plupart ont été détruits.
Et ceux qui restent ?
Reconvertis.
Celui-ci est un bar.
Une pinte pour 5 livres et
gratuit pour les filles avant 23h.
J'ai un signal de la mer !
La mer, à l'intérieur des terres ?
Elle traverse le centre ville.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
J'ai cru voir quelque chose.
Quoi ?
Des fantômes.
Ne sois pas stupide.
Donc l'Electro est le dernier.
Les voyageurs de la nuit
s'y seraient produits ?
Possible.
Si le cinéma a tué les troupes,
c'est peut-être leur moyen de revenir.
Leur dernière chance de s'échapper
avant que tous ces films n'aient disparu.
N'est-ce pas la meilleure
des vengeances ?
Ils ont été oubliés,
sur ces bouts de film.
Ils cherchent maintenant
un nouveau public.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a Tosh ?
- Elle relevait la mer.
Au milieu de la ville.
Elle est partie maintenant.
J'enregistrais le son des vagues.
Des mouettes.
Je sentais presque l'ozone.
- Rien d'autre ?
- Non.
Bon sang, qu'est-ce qu'ils fabriquent ?
J'aime les lumières.
Elles font scintiller la pluie.
Et elles font partie de nous.
Sens l'eau.
Goûte-la.
Attention.
- Combien maintenant ?
- Six.
J'aimerais pouvoir voir l'air
qu'ils ont un jour respiré.
Tu sais que c'est impossible.
On ne pourra jamais le voir.
On a leurs fantômes.
Je peux les voir quand je veux.
Notre public.
Ils ne nous quitteront jamais.
On ne peut pas voir,
mais on peut entendre.
Ecoute.
C'est vrai !
Je peux les entendre !
Leurs derniers petits souffles,
soupirant toujours.
Peut-on amener les autres ?
En faire des fantômes pour toujours ?
Les autres ne devraient pas être
dans un vieux placard sombre.
Ils devraient être ici avec nous.
Et je veux voyager à
nouveau, me produire.
Très bien.
Mais d'abord,
il nous faut le reste du film.
On les a trouvés en voiture avec
leurs parents, près d'Hope Street.
Qu'est-il arrivé aux parents ?
Ils sont dans le même état hypnotique.
Ils sont sortis de la pluie.
Qu'avez-vous dit ?
Rien. Pourquoi ?
Ces mots, "Sortis de la pluie".
Je suis sûre de les avoir déjà entendus.
Oh, je me souviens,
c'était Christina, une patiente.
Ici ?
Non. A Providence Park.
Un hôpital psychiatrique.
Je connais.
Je travaillais là-bas.
C'était une patiente à temps plein.
Là-bas depuis toute petite.
Elle était étrange.
Quand il y avait une foire ou un
spectacle, elle était effrayée.
Elle courait se cacher.
A-t-elle dit pourquoi ?
Oui. Elle disait qu'ils venaient
voler son dernier souffle.
La pauvre.
Je crois qu'on vient de
trouver notre premier témoin.
Ils sont sortis de la pluie.
La nuit. Au village.
Quel âge aviez-vous ?
Oh, j'étais juste une enfant.
5 ou 6 ans.
Vous venez voir quelqu'un ?
Christina, on est venus vous voir.
Personne ne vient me voir.
Vos yeux sont plus vieux
que votre visage.
- C'est une mauvaise chose ?
- Oui.
Ça veut dire que
vous n'êtes pas à votre place.
Que vous venez de nulle part.
Christina, parlez-nous d'eux.
Les gens qui sortaient de la pluie.
Il y avait de la musique.
De la vielle à roue.
Des acrobates.
Et un homme avec du feu dans les mains.
Qui d'autre était là ?
Un homme dans des habits sombres,
et une femme. Une jeune et jolie
femme dans un costume d'argent.
Elle semblait briller.
Ils vous ont touché, je le sens.
Ils vous ont touché alors
qu'ils passaient devant vous.
Parlez-nous de l'homme, Christina.
Il m'a parlé.
Il m'a demandé si je voulais
rejoindre la troupe.
Il a sorti une sorte de flasque
de sa poche.
C'était poli comme de l'argent.
Je lui ai demandé son nom.
Je ne l'oublierai jamais.
Il a dit qu'il était
le Créateur de Fantômes.
Il voulait prendre mon souffle
et le mettre dans sa flasque.
Il a dit que je pourrais
voyager avec le cirque,
que je serais dans son public,
pour toujours.
Je me suis retournée et j'ai
couru aussi vite que possible.
Des gens ont disparu du
village cette nuit-là.
Ma mère.
Mon père.
Voilà. Eglise Stretton, 1901.
Des gens ont disparu quand une troupe
itinérante a visité la ville.
Et avant ça, en 1898
dans le petit village de Wellsfield.
Beaucoup de légendes circulaient sur
ces disparitions à travers les années.
Les gens étaient encore en
vie mais dépourvus de souffle.
On disait aux enfants de retenir leur
souffle quand les cirques passaient.
Oui, ce journal local
ne l'a pas pris au sérieux.
L'Hunstanton Chronicle, en mars 1911.
"Police et médecins sont restés quois
quand M. Alfred Mace a soutenu
que sa femme pouvait être ramenée à
la vie grâce à une certaine flasque".
Il pensait que le dernier souffle de
sa femme avait été mis dans une flasque.
Une flasque en argent.
Et le dernier souffle de chaque victime.
- C'est ainsi qu'il fait ses fantômes.
- Si on trouve la flasque...
On peut les sauver.
Nous avons enfin le film.
C'est l'heure d'amener les autres.
Jack, c'est Jonathan, ils sont là,
à mon appartement, vous devez venir !
Qui était là ?
Une femme, étendue sous l'eau.
J'ai cru qu'elle s'était noyée.
- Personne d'autre ?
- Non.
Attention.
Bernard était sensé venir aujourd'hui ?
Non.
Par ici, s'il vous plaît.
- Ils n'ont pas quitté les alentours.
- Ils ne peuvent sûrement pas.
Ils ont besoin d'être près de l'Electro.
- Tous mes vieux films ont été ouverts.
- Ils contenaient quoi ?
- Des numéros de cirque.
- Ils en amènent plus.
On doit les arrêter.
Gwen, Owen. Rendez-vous à l'Electro.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Je dois trouver mes parents.
S'il leur arrive quelque chose...
C'est encore cette odeur.
De produit chimique.
Oui, je la sens.
- Comme quand on développe un film.
- Cette femme.
Elle m'a attrapé.
Mais sa main était différente.
Ce n'était pas une vraie main.
Ce n'était pas de la chair.
C'était comme toucher un bout
de plastique ou de celluloïd.
Ils sont restés 80 ans dans ce film.
Ils en sont devenus partie intégrante.
- Et si on les filmait ?
- Film d'un film ?
Oui.
Ils seraient piégés.
Ce truc est chargé ?
S'ils ont été piégé sur un film avant...
On peut s'en débarrasser
de la même façon.
Supposons qu'ils sont faits de camphre
ou de nitrate, d'ombres et de lumière.
- Juste assez de lumière.
- On les filme. On les capture.
Puis on expose le film
à un maximum de lumière.
Bien sûr.
- On les aveuglera, on les perdra.
- Espérons.
<i>On est à l'Electro.
Il se passe quelque chose.</i>
Allons-y.
Vous entendez ?
- C'est peut-être mes parents.
- Ils s'enfermeraient ?
Non.
S'il vous plaît, laissez-les.
- Maman ? Papa ?
- Doucement.
Que se passe-t-il ? Maman ?
- Non, Jonathan.
- Maman !
Papa !
Que s'est-il passé ?
S'il vous plaît !
Ne mourez pas ! Parlez-moi !
Laissez-moi !
Ils ont été gelés sur place,
un cirque a besoin d'un public.
Sortez-le de là.
- Jonathan, viens là.
- Laissez-moi.
Owen, va voir qui est en haut.
Toujours les mêmes images.
Ils sortent.
Ouvrez !
On a réussi.
Nous sommes à nouveau réunis.
Cet endroit est nôtre.
Il nous appartient.
La ville entière nous appartient !
Mais qu'êtes-vous ? Il n'y a pas
de souffle dans votre pauvre corps.
Vous ne me servez à rien.
La flasque ! Il l'a !
Je l'ai !
Gwen, ça va ?
- Ça va ?
- Oui !
Owen, occupe-toi de la famille.
Non ! S'il vous plaît !
Si leurs souffles s'échappent de la
flasque, toutes les victimes mourront.
Vite ! On pourrait les perdre à jamais !
Elles sont en arrêt cardiaque,
appelez les médecins.
Un.
On n'en a sauvé qu'un.
Je l'entends, Jack.
Je l'ai entendu.
Quelque chose m'appelle à l'intérieur.
On a réussi à en sauver un.
Mais lequel ?
On n'a rien pu faire.
Ils sont morts si soudainement.
Sauf ce pauvre petit.
J'imagine qu'il sera le prochain.
Que faites-vous ?
J'ai besoin de vous.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- S'il vous plaît.
Faites-moi confiance.
Aidez-moi.
Attention.
Tenez sa tête.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Quelque chose qui lui appartient.
Son dernier souffle.
Sa vie.
Que lui avez-vous fait ?
Ça a marché.
Bienvenue.
Les pellicules dans la
chambre de Jonathan...
Je les ai prises et détruites.
Espérons que ce soit la fin.
Ce qui m'inquiète, c'est tous
ces bouts de films perdus.
Oubliés dans des caves
poussiéreuses, cachés dans des lofts.
Les voyageurs de la nuit pourraient
encore être là, quelque part.
A attendre.
C'est combien ?
Jonah Bevan. Il a disparu en
rentrant d'un match de foot.
En quoi est-il spécial ?
Quelque chose brille,
juste en dehors du champ.
Cardiff connaît une épidémie
de personnes disparues.
J'en ferai mon projet spécial.
- Laisse tomber.
- Je ne peux pas.
- Il doit être là, quelque part.
- Tosh, on peut garder ça entre nous ?
Tu le couvres, alors.
Au beau milieu du canal de Bristol ?
Et si la brèche ne faisait pas
que laisser des choses derrière elle ?
Et si elle en prenait ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il fait ici ?
- Tu étais au barrage ?
- Ferme cette enquête !

Adrift</font>
Jonah Bevan,born 15th February 1993,
son of Nikki Bevan and Paul
Millet,14 Cliffs Rise,Penarth.
Disappeared walking home
from football practice,
been missing now for seven
months and eleven days.
No body,no sightings since that night.
Disappeared right where we're standing.
Which is where we found this.
He sent a text to his mum,she was
looking out the window and they waved.
She says everywhere was deserted.
And the investigation?
Usual procedure
- searched the home,spoken to all friends and relatives,
made publicity appeals,but
no significant leads...
Is this beneath you now?
No!
Then what's with the attitude?
You've a face like a slapped arse.
I want you to tell me where you were.
Where I was when?
At the wedding.
I rang you. I had to work.
Temple changed the
rota at the last minute.
I checked the duty logs.
You had three days off.
Are you spying on me now?
I thought we were mates.
And you just don't turn up!
I just thought,being as Rhys
has got a problem with me...
Rhys thinks you're great! It's
you who has a problem with him!
You've always made sarky
comments about his weight!
He could stand to lose
a couple of pounds...
Let it go! Let it go.
Yeah,well,I can't! All right?
I don't want to sit there and watch
you pledge your stupid life to him!
I've got better things
to do of a Saturday!
Happy now?
- Oh,Andy!
- Get off!
I thought we'd been through
this. You're a lovely fella...
It's not like a bloody tap.
I can't just switch it off.
But this was three years ago.
I mean,I didn't know...
I didn't realise you
still had feelings...
I don't,all right? I just had a moment.
Don't flatter yourself.
OK!
If you want to talk about it...
I wanna talk about this kid. Jonah.
Teenagers go missing all the time.
I mean,why is this one so special?
I was the first one here.
Sat with his mum all
night and all the next day.
Every time I tell her we've got
nothing new,I see a bit of her die.
Anything strange about the case?
Like you don't know.
What just happened?
Exactly.
The camera records one
frame every six seconds.
He could've done a lot in six
seconds,jumped over the side...
No,he's looking at something glowing,just
out of the camera's line of sight.
Like a flare,it's not there
in the previous frame...
or the next.
Could be one of the
lights on the Barrage.
All right,stop lying. You
know what happened here.
Why aren't you telling me?
What are you talking about,Andy?
Right...45 minutes later...
What's your mate Mulder doing there?
Jack?
No recognisable rift activity
around the Barrage on that date.
What about if you tried...?
I ran checks for three
months either side.
Then extended the radius
by a mile and checked again.
Still nothing.
OK.Thanks.
When did you say this was?
About seven months back.
Were you on the Barrage that night?
They have this cute little coffee shack.
I sometimes stop by there.
A boy went missing.
Just under an hour
before you were there.
OK.
Jonah Bevan,15 years old.
I thought maybe you were
out there because of him.
Maybe if we'd registered rift activity.
No. I just checked with Tosh.
It was all clear.
Sorry. Can't help.
Do you want me to look into it for you?
No,it's fine.
So it was just a coincidence then?
Guess so. Gotta go.
Weevil hunting with Ianto.
So,you're covering it up then?
Jack said it was a coincidence.
- I can't help.
- Thanks a lot.
Should've known. Bloody Torchwood.
Fob me off,why don't you?
No. If there was something
going on,I would tell you.
Do you know what's happened to you,Gwen?
You've got hard.
Yeah? Well,maybe I've had to.
You used to care. You used
to be bothered about people.
Didn't matter who they
were,or what they did.
And now you're talking about coincidence,like
people go missing all the time.
Like it's a fact of life.
The old Gwen would have been up
there to see Nikki Bevan in a flash.
You're one of them now,aren't you?
Too busy to bother
with one missing child.
What is it,not major enough for you?
Not spooky enough?
Sorry to bother you.
Nikki Bevan? Gwen Cooper.
I'm working with the police
on Jonah's disappearance.
Andy said you might be round.
Oh,he did,did he?
Reckons you've got a
different area of expertise.
What is it,forensics?
I'm just a fresh eye.
Sorry about the mess.
Wow,film fan,are you?
Crowds.
Sorry?
It's all crowd footage.
Ever since he went. Football
matches,concerts,festivals...
Anywhere there's a crowd,I record it.
Go through it,frame by
frame,checking every face.
Sometimes I think it's him,but
the picture's so grainy,
I spend hours looking at
one corner of the screen.
But then the next day,I
check again and it's not.
It's the hope that's killing me.
Even if you saw him,what would you do?
Find someone that was with him.
If I could just let him know I saw
him. He's gotta be out there somewhere.
Do you think I'm mad?
No,I think you'd make
a great policewoman.
His room's as he left it?
I sleep in here some nights.
Bury my head in the pillow.
It still smells of him.
Except,the more I do it,the
more it smells like me.
I keep his diary for him.
I sit in here and imagine I'm him.
What do you think I did wrong?
Sorry?
Maybe I was too nosey...
or not interested enough.
Maybe he felt unloved.
All I've got is questions.
What about Jonah's dad?
We were only together about six weeks.
I thought when he first went missing and
was on the telly,his dad might get in touch.
But no,still manages to disappoint.
Oh,hang on!
Andy tried to find me a support
group,but there weren't any.
So I thought I'd set one up myself.
It's our first meeting. Will you come?
Oh,I dunno.
Andy'll be there.
{\a6}HAS SOMEONE YOU KNOW GONE
MISSING?COME ALONG TO SEARCHLIGHT
And I'm gonna do food. Oh,come on.
I don't wanna be sat there on my own.
I'll try,I've got to go.
I'm sorry,I know,I'm late.
Three hours!
It was a work thing,time just
got away from me. Ooh,wine!
We can do it another time though,yeah?
This is the fourth another time,Gwen!
- You said you'd cook.
- Did I?
When are we gonna have this talk?
Let's do it now. Come on,now's
good,I'm ready. Babies. Now.
- Really?
- Have I changed?
Since I joined
Torchwood. Am I different?
- Why?
- It's just something Andy said.
- OK,let me just tell you this one thing,OK?
- Go on.
He still fancies me.
Don't laugh,Rhys. That's why
he didn't come to the wedding.
Bloody hell. Poor sod.
I am a very sexy lady...
and you are a very lucky man!
Just remember that,OK?
We're not gonna talk
about kids tonight,are we?
We could do some practising.
Tell me you love me!
Gimme the toast.
Come on,tell me you love me first!
- Gimme the toast first!
- Tell me you love me!
- Gwen.
- Hi,Tosh.
I've dug up some new data
on that night at the Barrage.
I think you might
wanna take a look at it.
I'll be right there.
- Deserting me,are you?
- Yep.
Ugh,crumbs.
Hey,what have you got?
It's barely a blip on the system.
So insignificant,I've been ignoring it.
But when I looked closer...
This is what we recognise
as standard rift activity.
But what I've discovered is a negative rift
spike that occurred at the time you're querying.
Now,we've always assumed that these
readings were residual rift flares.
Like an aftershock.
But,because this one coincided with Jonah's
disappearance,I think we've been misinterpreting.
OK,so?
So,we've always believed that things
can only come through the rift one way.
What if we're wrong?
What if the rift doesn't
just leave stuff behind?
What if it also takes?
Who else have you told about this?
No-one. I called you
as soon as I realised.
It could be a coincidence,or an anomaly.
I can't be sure unless I can
cross-reference it with other examples.
Can we keep this to ourselves?
There's something I have to do.
Whatever you think is best.
Thank you,you're a sweetheart.
{\a6}HAS SOMEONE YOU KNOW GONE MISSING?COME ALONG TO SEARCHLIGHT.A NEW
SUPPORT GROUP FOR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES OF MISSING PERSONS.ALL ARE WELCOME
You're looking into it,then.
Still the same old me.
Thank you.
Yeah,well,I dunno why
I bother,you're so rude.
How's Rhys? Other than hungry.
- It's you two.
- Oh,that's nice.
I thought there'd be more here by now.
It's gonna just be me,isn't it?
No,I'm sure it won't. People will come.
Yeah,you know,"If you
build it,they will come".
Field Of Dreams? No?
Just me,then.
Anyway,sit down.
It is gonna be just us,isn't it?
We're looking for Nikki.
Yeah,that's me. Come in.
It's brilliant you found us.
There's food there,drinks,so
help yourself.
Is this missing persons?
Yeah.Come in. Erm,do you wanna drink?
Bloody hell!
How many of them are there?
You OK?
It's getting a bit too much now.
I dunno what you mean.
I said I'd help you look for one lad.
What about all those
people in there,what...
40,50?
Am I supposed to help all them,too?
Course not. Just focus on Jonah.
The rest aren't part
of this investigation.
But they are. Of course they are.
No,no,they're not!
Find a pattern. Find out what
happens,we might find Jonah.
- What?
- Brilliant. You're brilliant!
- I've gotta go.
- Where you going?
Cross-referencing!
Cross-referencing?
Cross-referencing?
You said we need more data to
be sure the rift takes people.
List of all missing persons in
Cardiff over the last ten years.
I'll deal with the personal details,
and I'm sending you dates,locations
and times they went missing.
And you want me to check the dates they
went missing,against negative rift spikes?
Yes,I do,and I'll dig
out any CCTV footage.
What about Jack?
Do we tell him what we're doing?
When we're sure. Tosh,if
we can prove you were right,
we can start looking for
the people who've been taken,
maybe even try and
stop it from happening.
Oh,my God!
There are really this many?
Now we tell Jack.
Cardiff has an epidemic
of missing persons,
totally out of kilter with
any other comparable city.
It's down to the rift.
Are you sure they aren't just missing persons?
People do go missing for other reasons.
No. Toshiko cross-referenced the
locations with the rift spikes.
Those we identified are
definitely victims of the rift.
What do we think happens to them?
Scattered through
time and space,I guess.
Cheery thought,thank you.
This is good work.
But I don't know what you want us to do.
Find a way to prevent it.
Toshiko,can we predict when
the spikes are gonna happen?
No. And they're gone
in a matter of seconds.
Then I don't know how we combat them.
Jack,we have a duty here.
These people are victims of the rift.
If they're attacked by a Weevil...
We can catch them. If they're
victims,we fix their wounds,
but this,we don't know when it's gonna
happen,we don't know where they end up.
Seriously,Gwen.Practically,tell
me what we should do.
We help those left behind.
Why not?
It's nothing to do with us. Move on.
Jack,you should see these people...
Some things we can't fix.
So we don't even try?
Look,Jack's right.
They need counselling.
Support. That is not us.
Ah,OK,is that what you all think?
We are the only ones who know the truth.
We CAN help them. We
don't have to be this hard.
It's not a badge of honour...!
- Close this down.
- Jack!
I'll talk to him.
So,is that it,then?
We sweep it under the carpet?
"Grant me the serenity to accept
the things I cannot change".
Oh,bollocks to serenity.
For a lovely girl,you've
got a very dirty mouth.
- Yes.
- I'm with Jack.
We did our best.
Thanks,Tosh.
On one hand,you've got blokes like Mo,
who swears it's the best
thing he's done in his life.
And then on the
other,you've got Big Dave,
who says it feels
like his life has ended
and now he's a second class
citizen in his own house.
Although to be fair,he said his life had
ended when Susy made him ditch the bike...
Will you just stop wittering!
Thank you. God...!
It's not wittering. It's talking.
We're supposed to be talking.
I've been trying to talk to you
for a week and you don't want to.
Wake up,Rhys! What's the
point? We don't need a talk!
It takes two seconds' thought!
How are we supposed to have kids with
my job? We don't do maternity leave!
"Jack,I'd love to help out with the
aliens,but I can't get a babysitter!
"I'll sort out that bomb once I've
dropped Rhys Junior off at nursery".
Stop dancing around a dead question!
You know,sometimes I fucking hate you!
I mean,look at you,caught up in your
little group,like nothing else matters.
Like being a hero is an
end in itself. It's not.
You save this city. Well done.
- You save the world. What for?
- Sorry?
Why are you doing it?
What are you fighting for?
- Because if I don't...
- Shut up,I'm talking now,right?
You do it so people
can live their lives.
And there's nothing
more important than that.
Falling in love,getting married,buying
flats,having kids,or not.
But real life. That's
what you're protecting.
And if you're starting to think that your
shit is more important than real life...
then we're not gonna
last very long,love.
I'm sorry.
- There's this thing at work...
- I don't care!
When you're with me,we deal
with us,right? Our lives.
You got a problem at
work,sort it at work.
Jack?
Jack,I...
Oh,God!
I'm sorry.
Ianto,I'm sorry,I didn't realise.
It doesn't matter.
And I wouldn't have
come in if I'd known...
Always room for one more.
We could've used you an hour
ago for naked hide-and-seek.
He cheats. He always cheats.
Was there something you wanted?
Jonah Bevan.The missing boy.
I'll make it my own special
project,my responsibility,
nothing to do with anyone
else. I'm not letting it go.
No.
What?
I don't know how I can be any clearer.
Oh,well...
Tosh has her projects,so
does Ianto. Why can't I?
- Leave it alone.
- I can't.
- Coming back in? Work to do.
- Yup.
Jack! We're not finished!
Yes,we are.
There's a package on your desk.
- Hello?'
- You still working?
- Sort of.
- Thought so.
There's a cup of tea here
'with your name on it.'
You think this will help us
with the Jonah Bevan case?
Just leave it,this is high tech stuff.
- Sorry,no. It's GPS.
- What?
Global Positioning System. About as
high tech as... oh,my mobile phone.
What you've got here is a glorified map.
Ooh,X marks the spot,eh?
X being the middle of
the Bristol Channel.
Oh,no,hang on,sorry,no.
Flat Holm Island. Who's
sending you out there?
That's just deserted scrubland.
Could you get us a refill?
While you bask in my
technical brilliance?
- Hello?
- You left me that package,didn't you?
Ianto?
I dunno what you mean.
What's going on?
- IANTO!
- Night,Gwen.
'Don't...'
Right,so first thing in
the morning,we hire a boat.
I know a couple of boat
skippers who owe me a favour.
We'll head to Flat Holm,see
if we can't sort this out.
Or,you get me the boat and
I'll tell you what I find.
No boat trip,no boat. I'm part of this.
- OK.
- Brilliant!
- But you do as I say.
- Yeah,course.
Listen,I was going to ask -
promise me you won't laugh
- have you got any vacancies coming up?
You know,with Torchwood.
Cos I was thinking,I'm
great to work with.
You know you could tip them the wink.
Maybe. Yeah.
What can I get you,lads?
Two burgers and two cheeseburgers...
Fifty quid.
That's a bit steep,innit? Offer him 35.
Gwen,I'm not being funny,if
you wanna haggle,go to Morocco.
All right,50 quid.
Open waves,here we come.
Get us a couple of teas before we go.
You're kidding?
You're not kidding. I dunno...
Do this for me and
I'll give you 100 quid.
I'm sorry,Andy!
Yeah,right!
I'm sorry!
All right!
'Who are you?'
Torchwood,access code 474317432.
I'm with Jack Harkness.
He's supposed to warn
us about visitors.'
Law unto himself,isn't he?
And he knows we'll always forgive him.
In the bush,those that stand out can
become immediate targets for predators,
At late February the population
has reached its former strength...'
This your first time?
We all find it difficult at first.
Are you looking for
anyone in particular?
Yes.
How many people are down here?
Didn't he tell you?
What's that?
Is he OK?
We do our best to help him.
Caroline...
Sorry,but why are they...?
MISSING HAVE YOU SEEN CAROLINE?
Are you all right?
Oh,my God...
They're here.
What are you doing to them?
What's going on here? Tell me!
I'll take it from here,Helen.
It was Ianto,wasn't it?
What are you doing?
I can explain.
No,no,no,no,no,no.
You stay away from me!
Let's go outside...
These are the people taken by the rift!
What are they doing
here? What have you done?
Gwen,listen to me.
He's here.
He's been here all along.
It's not that simple.
Open it!
- Gwen,before I...
- Now!
Hello?
Jonah?
I'm looking for Jonah.
Why?
Am I in the right room?
Yes. I'm Jonah.
I'm sorry. I must be in the wrong room.
The Jonah Bevan I'm looking for is 15 years
old and he went missing from the Barrage.
That was me.
Who are you?
My name is Gwen Cooper...
and I'm with Torchwood.
What... What's happened to you?
I was walking home.
There was a light.
I woke up and the land was on
fire,there were flames,for miles on end.
A man pulled me from the flames.
Took me to a building,where
they tried to work on the burns.
I thought I was going to die.
I don't remember when the
ground started shaking,
and then I realised it
wasn't a building after all.
It was a rescue craft.
The last off a burning planet.
We watched the Solar System burn.
It was so beautiful.
I am so sorry for
what's happened to you.
Can I trust you to tell the truth?
Of course.
Am I really home?
Yes. You're home.
Thank you.
Jonah,I've come because your
mother is still looking for you.
She's still alive?
You've only been gone for seven months.
She never stopped looking.
I tried so hard to come home.
I was lost so long.
You're safe now,you are safe.
Can I see her?
Can you bring her here?
Is that what you want?
When I took over Torchwood,there
were two,just like Jonah.
Ravaged from falling through the rift.
Being kept in the vaults,neglected.
I wanted them looked after.
I set this place up.
Told the staff these were
experiments gone wrong.
How many are there?
Seventeen,last count.
It's increased over the last year.
Like the rift is trying
to correct its mistakes.
But not all the missing return.
No.
You can't keep them hidden.
They have families
who deserve to know...
Gwen,they're sick.
In ways you could never imagine.
We can't fix them.
We just care for them.
Jonah's asked me to bring Nikki here.
- No.
- She has a right to know.
No way.
She said not knowing is the worst part.
How are you going to tell her her
child has aged 40 years in seven months?
That he's scarred,that he
can't look after himself...
We don't have the right
to hide it from her!
If you tell her,you have to tell
her about the rift and Torchwood.
Then I will.
What if she doesn't believe you?
I have to try. We owe her the truth.
Jack,if you'd lost
someone,wouldn't you want to know?
Let me try. Please.
We've got another meeting on Tuesday.
Will you come to that,or..?
You're not here for small talk.
I've found Jonah.
- Is he dead?
- No.
Is he hurt?
- We're looking after him.
- Where?
Can I see him?
Yes.
Sorry.
There are things I
have to tell you first.
And all I'm asking is you trust me.
Andy,I know you hate me right now.'
I'm hanging up.
No,please don't. It's about Nikki.
- I found Jonah.
- Where?
I can't tell you that.'
Oh,here we go again!
Piss off,why don't you?
I've got Nikki with me. I've told her
about Torchwood and about what we do.
I need you to confirm to her that
I'm not mad or dangerous or a liar.
You used me,Gwen.
I'm sorry.
That's how you see me,isn't it?'
Occasionally useful. Worth stringing
along,in case I can ever help you.
Andy...'
You'd never recommend for me
to join Torchwood,would you?
No.
Thank you.
I want to take Nikki to see Jonah.
But you've got to tell
her she can trust me.
We can fix this,Andy.We
can make it right.'
Put her on.
Nikki...
Andy?
OK...
..where is he?
Remember what I said. You
won't recognise him at first.
I know.
He's aged. He's been injured...
I just want to see him.
You understand what
I've told you now,Nikki.
- He's not a child any more.
- It doesn't matter.
I have to see him.
Let me see him.
OK.
Hello?
Jonah?
Yes?
I can't see you.
Jonah?
- Mum?
- No.
- No!
- It's OK,Mum,it's me,it's OK.
Stay away!
I'm sorry,I'm really,really sorry.
What're you doing? What
have you done to me?
Nikki,I promise,this is Jonah.
That is not my son!
Get me out,I want to get out of here.
Will you listen? This is him.
You are sick!
- Listen...
- All of you!
Did you fix my wardrobe door?
We bought it
flat-pack,made it together.
The bottom hinge comes loose.
- You said you'd sort it.
- No.
Every evening you buy a bottle of beer.
- You let me sneak one sip.
- Stop it!
- You've two alarms cos you sleep through the first.
- Make him stop!
You talk about when you can earn decent
money and afford some decent make-up.
I'm not hearing this!
You won't buy me a double bed cos you
don't understand what I need it for.
Shut up!
When I ask why you haven't
got married,you say,
"I'll never be lonely,cos
I've always got you."
It's me,Mum. It's me.
Jonah?
I feel so lost.
I've walked for
years,trying to get home.
I'm sorry.
Why?
That night.I was late. I'm sorry.
The sights I've seen,Mum.
It's fine!
It'll take time.
Look... It'll be OK.
You have to leave Jonah now.
- What?
- Helen,I'm fine.
It's for your own benefit.
No. I'm taking him home now.
Nikki,stop for a second.
You can't just take him out.
I know how to look after my child.
I'll tell them he's my father.
I can take care of him...!
We can't allow that.
He's my son,I say what's allowed!
Jonah?
- It's started again.
- What's happening?
He's starting the downswing.
What's a downswing?
What is it? Jonah?
You've seen him in the good phase.
It gets briefer every day.
It really might be best if you leave.
Helen...
Oh,it's all right,sweetheart,I'm here.
Make it stop!
I ever wish I could.
Please,it would be
better if you didn't stay.
- I'm not leaving.I'm not leaving him.
- OK.
Then you should move away.
Why?Will you tell me why?!
I'd never heard a sound like it.
This primal howl.
The scream lasts 20 hours every day.
Before the rift returned him,Jonah had
looked into the heart of a dark star.
What he'd seen had driven him mad.'
One Week Later
They say you can visit...
whenever you like.
When he's in a good phase.
Promise me you won't
do this to anyone else.
Before,I had the memory.
Whenever I thought of him,I'd
see him laughing with his mates,
playing football,scoffing his breakfast.
And now I just hear that...
that terrible noise.
- I thought you wanted to know what happened to him.
- I did.
I was wrong.
It was better when I didn't know.
Before you...
I had hope.
Apology,is it?
Tonight,we talk about what YOU want.
Kids...
..the future,anything you want.
Are you all right?
Hey,come here.
I'm sorry...!
Do you want to sit down?
OK.
Now then...
you tell me everything.
From the beginning.
There's this woman,Nikki.
She had a son...
..Jonah.
He went missing seven months ago...
Some people believe that in
the moments before your death,
your life flashes before your eyes.
Explosive devices.

Jonah Bevan, né le 15 Février 1993.
Fils de Nikki Bevan et Paul Millet.
14 Cliffs Rise, Penarth.
A disparu alors qu'il rentrait à pied
de son entraînement de foot.
Disparu depuis 7 mois et 11 jours.
Pas de corps,
personne ne l'a vu depuis.
Il a disparu juste là où on se trouve.
C'est ici qu'on a trouvé ça.
Il a envoyé un message à sa mère,
ils se sont faits signe par la fenêtre.
Elle dit que tout était désert.
Et l'enquête ?
Procédure standard. Fouille
de la maison, de son ordinateur,
interrogatoire de tous ses proches,
avis de recherches,
mais aucune piste concluante.
C'est plus pour toi, c'est ça ?
Mais non !
Alors qu'est-ce que t'as ?
On dirait une vieille pie.
Je veux savoir où tu étais.
Quand ça ?
Au mariage.
Je t'ai appelé, je travaillais.
On m'a appelé à la dernière minute.
Tu connais ça.
J'ai vérifié.
Tu avais trois jours de repos.
Tu m'espionnes, maintenant ?
Je croyais qu'on était amis.
Et tu ne viens pas ?
J'ai juste pensé que comme
Rhys a un problème avec moi...
Rhys te trouve génial !
C'est toi qui a un problème avec lui.
Depuis que tu le connais, tu ne fais
que te moquer de son poids !
Quelques kilos en moins
lui feraient pas de mal.
Et voilà ! Arrête ça.
Je peux pas, d'accord ?
Je voulais pas te voir lui prêter
bêtement serment pour la vie !
J'ai mieux à faire le samedi.
Contente ?
- Andy !
- Lâche-moi.
On est déjà passé par là.
Tu es génial...
C'est pas comme un robinet
que je peux arrêter.
Mais c'était il y a 3 ans.
Je ne savais pas...
Que tu avais encore des sentiments...
C'est pas le cas, d'accord ?
C'était juste temporaire.
Te fais pas mousser.
D'accord !
Si tu veux en parler...
Je veux parler de ce gamin, Jonah.
Des ados disparaissent tout le temps.
En quoi est-il spécial ?
J'étais le premier sur les lieux.
Je suis resté aux côtés de sa mère
toute la nuit et la journée suivante.
Je la voyais dépérir un peu plus
à chaque annonce négative.
Rien d'étrange concernant l'affaire ?
Comme si tu n'étais pas au courant.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Tu vois !
La caméra enregistre une image
toutes les 6 secondes.
Il a pu faire beaucoup de choses
en 6 secondes, sauter, se cacher...
Non, il regarde quelque chose.
Une lumière, juste en dehors du champ.
Comme une fusée.
On ne la voit pas sur l'image d'avant...
Ni sur celle d'après.
Ça pourrait être une lumière du barrage.
Bon, arrête ton char.
Tu sais ce qui s'est passé.
Pourquoi tu ne me le dis pas ?
De quoi tu parles, Andy ?
45 minutes plus tard.
Qu'est-ce que ton pote Mulder fait là?
Jack ?
Pas d'activité de la brèche
près du barrage cette nuit là.
Et si tu essayais...
J'ai vérifie sur 3 mois avant et après.
Puis j'ai étendu la recherche
d'1 kilomètre.
Toujours rien.
Merci.
Quand ça ?
Il y a environ 7 mois.
Tu étais au barrage cette nuit là ?
Ils ont un petit café sympa.
J'y vais parfois.
Un garçon a disparu.
A peu près une heure
avant que tu arrives.
OK.
Jonah Bevan, 15 ans.
Tu es peut-être allé là-bas pour lui.
Si la brèche a été active, peut-être.
Non, je viens de demander à Tosh.
Il ne s'est rien passé.
Désolé, je ne peux pas t'aider.
Tu veux que je me penche dessus ?
Non, c'est bon.
C'était juste une coïncidence, alors ?
Je suppose. Je dois y aller.
Chasse au Weevil avec Ianto.
Alors tu le couvres ?
Jack dit que c'était une coïncidence.
- Je peux rien pour toi.
- Merci beaucoup.
J'aurais dû m'en douter.
Foutu Torchwood.
Tu m'envoies balader, bien sûr.
Non, s'il se passait quelque chose,
je te le dirais.
Tu sais ce qu'il t'est arrivé, Gwen ?
Tu t'es endurcie.
J'ai peut-être pas eu le choix.
Avant, tu t'impliquais.
Tu te souciais des gens.
Peu importe qui ils étaient
ou ce qu'ils avaient fait.
Maintenant tu me parles de coïncidence.
Comme si les gens disparaissaient
tout le temps.
Comme si c'était un fait de la vie.
L'ancienne Gwen n'aurait pas hésité
un instant à aller parler à Nikki Bevan.
Tu es devenue l'une d'entre eux.
Trop occupée pour te préoccuper
d'un enfant disparu.
C'est pas assez important pour toi ?
Pas assez effrayant ?
Désolé de t'avoir embêtée.
Nikki Bevan ? Gwen Cooper.
Je travaille avec la police
sur la disparition de Jonah.
Andy m'a dit que
vous passeriez sûrement.
Ah, il a fait ça ?
Vous devez avoir une
spécialisation différente.
Médecine légale ?
Je suis juste un oeil nouveau.
Désolée pour le désordre.
Vous êtes fan de cinéma ?
Des foules.
Comment ?
Ce sont des films de foules.
Depuis qu'il est parti.
Matchs de foot, concerts, festivals...
Dès qu'il y a une foule, j'enregistre.
Je visionne tout, image par image,
regardant chaque visage.
Parfois je crois que c'est lui,
mais l'image est tellement mauvaise...
Je passe des heures à fixer
un coin de l'écran.
Et puis le lendemain,
je vérifie et ce n'est plus lui.
C'est l'espoir qui me tue.
Et si vous le reconnaissiez,
que feriez-vous ?
Je trouverais quelqu'un
qui était avec lui.
S'il pouvait savoir que je l'ai vu.
Il doit bien être là, quelque part.
Vous me pensez folle ?
Non, vous feriez un bon policier.
Vous n'avez pas touché à sa chambre ?
Je dors parfois ici.
J'enfouis ma tête dans son oreiller.
Il y a encore son odeur.
Mais plus je le fais,
plus ça prend la mienne.
Je tiens son journal pour lui.
Je m'assieds ici et
j'imagine que je suis lui.
Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait de mal ?
Pardon ?
J'étais peut-être trop curieuse.
Ou pas assez intéressée.
Il se sentait peut-être mal aimé.
Je n'ai que des questions.
Et le père de Jonah ?
On a été ensemble que 6 semaines.
Quand il a disparu et
qu'il passait partout à la télé,
j'ai pensé que son père me contacterait.
Mais non, il m'a encore déçue.
Attendez.
Andy m'a cherché un groupe de soutien,
mais il n'y en avait aucun.
J'en ai créé un moi-même.
C'est notre première réunion.
Vous viendrez ?
Oh, je ne sais pas.
Andy sera là.
Je ferai à manger. S'il vous plaît.
Je ne veux pas me retrouver seule.
J'essayerai. Je dois y aller.
Désolée, je sais, je suis en retard.
De 3 heures !
C'était pour le boulot, j'ai perdu
la notion du temps. Oh, du vin !
Mais on peut faire ça une autre fois ?
C'est la 4ème fois que tu dis ça !
- Tu devais cuisiner !
- Ah bon ?
Quand va-t'on avoir cette conversation ?
Maintenant ! Allez, c'est bon.
Je suis prête. Les bébés.
- Vraiment ?
- J'ai changé ?
Depuis que je travaille
à Torchwood, je suis différente ?
- Pourquoi ?
- Un truc qu'Andy a dit...
- Laisse-moi te raconter quelque chose.
- Vas-y.
Il en a toujours après moi.
C'est pas drôle. C'est pour ça
qu'il n'est pas venu au mariage.
Bon sang, le pauvre.
Je suis une femme très sexy.
Tu as beaucoup de chance.
N'oublie pas ça, d'accord ?
On ne va pas parler
d'enfants ce soir, si ?
On pourrait faire un peu de pratique.
Dis-moi que tu m'aimes !
Donne-moi ce toast.
Allez, dis-le-moi d'abord !
- Donne-moi ce toast !
- Dis-moi que tu m'aimes !
Salut Tosh.
J'ai trouvé de nouvelles données
sur cette nuit au barrage.
Tu devrais venir voir ça.
J'arrive tout de suite.
- Tu m'abandonnes ?
- Oui.
T'as des miettes !
Qu'est-ce que tu as trouvé ?
C'est un très faible signal.
Tellement insignifiant
que je l'ignorais.
Mais en regardant de plus près...
Voilà la forme d'une activité
standard de la brèche.
Mais j'ai découvert une pointe négative
qui s'est produite cette nuit là.
On a toujours pris ces signaux pour
des résidus d'activité de la brèche.
Comme un après choc.
Mais comme celui-ci coïncide avec
la disparition de Jonah,
je crois qu'on s'est trompés.
Donc...
On a toujours cru que les choses
passent par la brèche dans un seul sens.
Et si on avait tort ?
Et si la brèche ne faisait pas
que laisser des choses derrière elle ?
Et si elle en prenait ?
A qui d'autre as-tu parlé de ça ?
Personne. Je t'ai appelée tout de suite.
Ça pourrait être une coïncidence
ou une anomalie.
Je ne peux être sûre qu'en comparant
ces données avec d'autres exemples.
On peut garder ça pour nous ?
Je dois faire quelque chose.
C'est comme tu veux.
Merci, tu es adorable.
Alors tu t'y intéresses.
Je suis toujours la même.
Merci.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi je fais ça,
tu es si grossier.
Comment va Rhys ?
A part qu'il a faim.
- Oh, c'est vous deux.
- Sympa.
Je pensais que des gens
seraient déjà arrivés.
Ça sera juste moi, alors.
Non. Des gens vont arriver.
Oui !
"Si vous le construisez, ils viendront."
"Jusqu'au bout du rêve", personne ?
C'est tout.
Asseyez-vous.
Ça ne sera que nous, alors.
Bonjour, nous cherchons Nikki.
C'est moi. Entrez !
Vous avez trouvé !
Il y a à manger et à boire, servez-vous.
C'est pour les personnes disparues ?
Oui, entrez. Je vous sers à boire ?
Bon sang !
Combien sont-ils ?
Ça va ?
Ça commence à faire beaucoup.
Comment ça ?
J'ai accepté de t'aider pour un cas.
Et tous ces gens à l'intérieur...
Il y en a 40, 50 ?
Je dois tous les aider aussi ?
Bien sûr que non.
Concentre-toi sur Jonah.
Les autres ne font pas
partie de l'enquête.
Mais si. Bien sûr que si.
Non, pas du tout.
On trouve un motif récurrent,
on découvre ce qu'il se passe,
et on pourrait retrouver Jonah.
- Quoi ?
- Génial ! Tu es génial !
- Je dois y aller.
- Où vas-tu ?
Le comparer avec d'autres cas.
Le comparer avec d'autres cas ?
Tu disais qu'il nous fallait plus
de données
pour être sûres que la brèche
prend des gens.
C'est la liste des personnes disparues
sur Cardiff ces 10 dernières années.
Je m'occupe des détails personnels.
Je t'envoie les dates, lieux
et heures de leurs disparitions.
Et tu veux que je compare les moments
de disparitions avec les pics négatifs ?
Oui, et je cherche
tout enregistrement vidéo.
Et Jack ?
On lui dit ce qu'on fait ?
Quand on sera sûres.
Si on peut prouver que tu as raison,
on pourra chercher tous ces gens
qui ont été enlevés
et peut-être même essayer d'arrêter ça.
Oh mon dieu !
Il y en a vraiment autant ?
Maintenant, on en parle à Jack.
Cardiff est frappée par une épidémie
de personnes disparues,
bien plus importante que la normale
pour une ville de cette taille.
Ça a un rapport avec la brèche.
Tu es sûre que ce ne sont pas
des cas normaux ? Ça arrive souvent.
Non, Toshiko a comparé les disparitions
avec l'activité de la brèche.
Ceux que l'on a identifiés
sont bien victimes de la brèche.
Que penses-tu qu'il leur arrive ?
Eparpillés à travers le temps
et l'espace, je suppose.
Sympathique, merci.
C'est du beau travail.
Mais je ne vois pas ce que tu
veux qu'on fasse.
Trouver un moyen d'arrêter ça.
Toshiko, peut-on prédire quand
les pics vont se produire ?
Non, et ils disparaissent
en quelques secondes.
Alors je ne vois pas quoi faire.
Jack, c'est notre devoir.
Ces personnes sont victimes
de la brèche.
S'ils étaient attaqués
par des Weevils...
On peut attraper les Weevils.
On peut soigner les victimes.
Mais ça, on ne sait pas
quand ça va arriver.
On ne sait pas où ces gens finissent.
Sérieusement, Gwen.
Dis-moi ce que tu veux qu'on fasse.
On aide ceux qui sont encore là.
Pourquoi pas ?
Ça n'a rien à voir avec nous.
Passe à autre chose.
Tu devrais voir ces gens...
On ne peut pas tout arranger.
Donc on n'essaie même pas ?
Jack a raison.
Il leur faut un suivi, du soutien.
Ça n'est pas de notre ressort.
Vous pensez tous ça ?
Nous sommes les seuls
à connaître la vérité.
Nous pouvons les aider,
pas besoin d'être aussi froids.
C'est pas un badge d'honneur...
Ferme ce dossier.
Je vais lui parler.
Alors c'est tout ?
On glisse ça sous le tapis ?
"Donne-moi la sérénité d'accepter
les choses que je ne puis changer."
J'emmerde la sérénité !
Pour une fille charmante,
tu as un langage très coloré.
Oui.
Je suis avec Jack.
On a fait de notre mieux.
Merci, Tosh.
D'un côté, il y a des mecs comme Mo,
qui jure que c'est la meilleure chose
qu'il ait fait dans sa vie.
Et puis il y a le grand Dave,
qui dit que sa vie est comme finie,
qu'il n'est plus qu'un citoyen
de seconde classe.
Mais bon, il disait déjà ça quand
Susy lui a fait arrêter la moto.
Tu veux bien arrêter de radoter !
Merci. Bon sang !
Je radote pas. Je parle.
On est censés parler.
J'essaye de te parler depuis
une semaine, mais tu repousses.
Ouvre les yeux ! A quoi bon ?
On a pas besoin de parler !
La décision est vite vue !
Comment veux-tu avoir des enfants
avec mon boulot ?
Torchwood ne fait pas
les congés maternité.
"Désolée Jack,
j'aimerais aider avec les aliens
mais je trouve pas de baby-sitter !"
"Je m'occuperai de cette bombe après
avoir déposé Rhys Junior à la crèche."
Arrête d'y penser, c'est impossible !
Des fois, je te déteste vraiment !
Regarde-toi !
Plongée dans ton petit groupe,
comme si rien d'autre ne comptait.
Comme si être un héros
était une fin en soi.
Ça ne l'est pas.
Tu sauves la ville, bien joué !
Tu sauves le monde, mais pourquoi ?
Pourquoi tu le fais ?
Pourquoi tu te bats ?
- Si je le fais pas...
- La ferme. C'est moi qui parle !
Tu le fais pour que les gens
puissent vivre leurs vies.
Et il n'y a rien de plus important.
Tomber amoureux, se marier,
acheter un appart...
avoir des enfants ou pas.
Mais c'est la vraie vie,
c'est ça que tu protèges.
Et si tu te mets à croire que ton bordel
est plus important que la vraie vie...
On n'ira pas bien loin tous les deux.
Je suis désolée.
- C'est ce truc au boulot.
- Je m'en fiche !
Quand tu es avec moi,
tu t'occupes de nous. De nos vies.
Si tu as un problème au boulot,
tu le résous au boulot.
Jack ?
Jack, je...
Oh mon dieu !
Désolée.
Ianto, je suis désolée, j'avais pas vu.
C'est pas grave.
Je ne serais pas rentrée si j'avais su.
Il y a toujours de la place pour plus.
Tu aurais pu jouer avec nous à
cache-cache nu, tout à l'heure.
Il triche. Il triche tout le temps.
Tu voulais quelque chose ?
Jonah Bevan. Le garçon disparu.
Je vais en faire mon projet personnel.
Ma responsabilité à moi seule.
Je ne laisse pas tomber.
Non.
Quoi ?
Je ne peux pas être plus clair.
Tosh a ses projets, Ianto aussi.
Pourquoi pas moi ?
- Laisse tomber.
- Non.
Tu reviens ? On a du boulot.
Jack, on a pas fini !
Si.
Il y a un paquet sur ton bureau.
Tu travailles encore ?
- En quelque sorte.
- Je m'en doutais.
Une tasse de thé t'attend ici.
Tu crois que ça va nous aider ?
N'y touche pas,
c'est de la haute technologie.
- Non, c'est juste un GPS.
- Quoi ?
Système de localisation.
C'est pas plus évolué que mon portable.
Tu as là une carte améliorée.
Le X marque un endroit.
Au milieu du canal de Bristol.
Attends, non.
L'île de Flat Holm.
Qui t'envoie là bas ?
C'est juste une île désertée.
Tu vas nous resservir ?
Pendant que tu te remets
de tant d'intelligence ?
Tu m'as laissé ce paquet.
Je ne vois pas de quoi tu parles.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Bonne nuit, Gwen.
Bon, dès demain matin,
on loue un bateau.
Je connais plusieurs marins
qui m'en doivent une.
On se dirige vers Flat Holm,
pour voir ce qu'on trouve là-bas.
Ou bien tu me trouves le bateau
et je te dis que ce je trouve.
Pas de voyage sans bateau.
Je suis de la partie.
- D'accord.
- Génial.
- Mais tu m'écouteras.
- Bien sûr.
J'ai une question.
Ne te fiches pas de moi.
Vous n'avez pas de poste libre ?
Tu sais, à Torchwood.
Les gens aiment travailler avec moi.
Tu pourrais leur parler de moi.
Peut-être, oui.
50 livres.
C'est un peu salé.
Propose lui 35.
Gwen, je plaisante pas.
Si tu veux marchander, va au Maroc.
Très bien, 50 livres.
Pleine mer, nous voilà !
Va nous chercher du thé avant de partir.
Tu plaisantes ?
Tu es sérieuse...
Faites ce que je vous dis et
je vous donnerai 100 livres.
Désolée, Andy !
Ouais, c'est ça !
Je suis désolée.
C'est bon !
Qui est-ce ?
Torchwood, code d'accès 474317432.
Je suis avec Jack Harkness.
Il doit nous prévenir des visites.
Fidèle à lui même.
Et il sait qu'on le pardonnera toujours.
C'est votre première fois ?
C'est toujours difficile.
Vous cherchez quelqu'un en particulier ?
Oui.
Combien de gens sont ici ?
Il ne vous l'a pas dit ?
Qu'es-ce que c'est ?
On fait de notre mieux pour l'aider.
Pourquoi sont-ils... ?
Ça va ?
Oh mon dieu !
Ils sont ici.
Que leur faites-vous,
que se passe-t-il ici ?
Je prends le relais, Helen.
C'est Ianto, j'imagine.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Je peux t'expliquer.
Non, ne t'approche pas de moi !
Sortons parler.
Ce sont les gens pris par la brèche.
Que font-ils ici, qu'as-tu fait ?
Gwen, écoute-moi.
Il est ici.
Il est là depuis tout ce temps.
Ce n'est pas si simple.
Ouvre la porte !
- Gwen, avant que...
- Maintenant !
Bonjour ?
Jonah ?
Je cherche Jonah.
Pourquoi ?
Je suis dans la bonne chambre ?
Oui. Je suis Jonah.
Désolée. J'ai dû me tromper.
Le Jonah Bevan que je cherche a 15 ans,
il a disparu sur le barrage.
C'était moi.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Je suis Gwen Cooper.
Je travaille pour Torchwood.
Que vous est-il arrivé ?
Je rentrais chez moi.
J'ai vu une lumière.
Je me suis réveillé,
et les terres étaient en feu.
Il y avait des flammes à perte de vue.
Un homme m'a sorti des flammes.
Il m'a emmené dans un bâtiment où
ils ont tenté de soigner les brûlures.
J'ai cru que j'allais mourir.
Je ne sais pas trop quand le sol
a commencé à trembler.
Et puis j'ai réalisé que ce n'était
pas un bâtiment.
C'était un vaisseau de secours.
Le dernier d'une planète en feu.
Nous avons regardé
brûler le système solaire.
C'était si beau.
Je suis vraiment désolée de
ce qui vous est arrivé.
Vous pouvez me dire la vérité ?
Bien sûr.
Je suis vraiment rentré ?
Oui, vous êtes chez vous.
Merci.
Jonah, je suis venu car votre mère
vous cherche toujours.
Elle est encore en vie ?
Ça fait seulement 7 mois.
Elle n'a jamais arrêté de chercher.
J'ai essayé de rentrer tant de fois.
J'ai été perdu si longtemps.
Vous êtes en sécurité, maintenant.
Vous êtes sauf.
Je peux la voir ?
Vous pouvez l'amener ici ?
C'est ce que vous voulez ?
Quand j'ai repris Torchwood,
il y en avait deux comme Jonah.
Ravagés par leur chute
à travers la brèche.
Enfermés dans les voûtes, négligés.
J'ai voulu qu'on s'occupe d'eux.
J'ai organisé cet endroit.
J'ai dit au personnel qu'ils étaient
les résultats de mauvaises expériences.
Combien sont-ils ?
17, au dernier compte.
Ça a augmenté ces dernières années.
Comme si la brèche essayait
de corriger ses erreurs.
Mais ils ne reviennent pas tous.
Non.
Tu ne peux pas les cacher ainsi.
Leurs familles méritent de savoir...
Gwen, ils sont malades.
Tu ne peux imaginer à quel point.
On ne peut pas les guérir.
Juste prendre soin d'eux.
Jonah a demandé à voir Nikki.
- Non.
- Elle a le droit de savoir.
Hors de question.
Elle dit que ne pas savoir
est le plus dur.
Comment veux-tu lui expliquer
que son enfant a pris 40 ans en 7 mois ?
Qu'il est marqué, qu'il ne peut
prendre soin de lui-même.
On a pas le droit de lui cacher ça !
Si tu lui dis, tu devras lui parler
de la brèche et de Torchwood.
Alors je le ferai.
Et si elle ne te croit pas ?
J'aurais essayé. On lui doit la vérité.
Jack, si tu avais perdu quelqu'un,
tu ne voudrais pas savoir ?
Laisse-moi essayer, s'il te plaît.
Nous avons une autre réunion mardi.
Vous viendrez... ?
Vous n'êtes pas venue
faire la conversation.
J'ai trouvé Jonah.
- Il est mort ?
- Non.
Il est blessé ?
- On prend soin de lui.
- Où ça ?
Je peux le voir ?
Oui.
Excusez-moi.
Mais je dois d'abord vous parler.
Et je veux seulement
que vous me croyiez.
Andy, je sais que tu m'en veux.
Je raccroche.
Non, s'il te plaît.
C'est à propos de Nikki.
- J'ai trouvé Jonah.
- Où est-il ?
Je ne peux pas te le dire.
Et c'est reparti !
Va te faire voir...
Je suis avec Nikki. Je lui ai parlé
de Torchwood et ce qu'on fait.
Tu dois lui confirmer que je ne suis ni
folle, ni dangereuse, ni une menteuse.
Tu t'es servie de moi, Gwen.
Je suis désolée.
C'est comme ça que tu me vois ?
Parfois utile. Qui vaut le coup de
rester en contact au cas où.
Andy...
Tu ne me recommanderas jamais
pour rejoindre Torchwood ?
Non.
Merci.
Je veux emmener Nikki voir Jonah.
Mais tu dois lui assurer qu'elle
peut me faire confiance.
On peut arranger ça, Andy.
Passe-la-moi.
Nikki ?
Andy ?
OK...
Où est-il ?
N'oubliez pas ce que j'ai dit.
Vous ne le reconnaîtrez pas.
Je sais.
Il a vieilli, il a été blessé.
Je veux juste le voir.
Vous avez compris, Nikki.
- Ce n'est plus un enfant.
- Ça n'a pas d'importance.
Il faut que je le voie.
Laissez-moi le voir.
D'accord.
Bonjour ?
Jonah ?
Oui ?
Je ne te vois pas.
Jonah ?
- Maman ?
- Non.
- Non !
- C'est bon Maman. C'est moi.
Eloigne-toi !
Je suis désolé, vraiment désolé.
Que faites-vous ?
Qu'est-ce que vous m'avez fait ?
Nikki, je vous le promets, c'est Jonah.
Ça n'est pas mon fils !
Sortez-moi de là. Je veux sortir.
Ecoutez-moi, c'est lui.
Vous êtes malade !
Vous tous !
Tu as réparé la porte du placard ?
On l'a acheté en kit,
on l'a monté ensemble.
Le gond du bas sortait toujours.
- Tu disais que tu t'en occuperais.
- Non.
Chaque soir tu achètes une bière.
- Tu m'en donnes une gorgée. Juste une.
- Arrête-ça !
Tu as 2 réveils car
tu te rendors toujours.
Faites-le taire !
Tu rêves du jour où tu pourras
t'acheter du maquillage correct.
Je ne veux pas entendre ça !
Tu ne veux pas m'acheter un lit double
car tu n'en vois pas l'utilité.
La ferme !
Quand je te demande
pourquoi tu n'es pas mariée,
tu réponds "Je ne serai jamais seule,
je t'aurais toujours toi".
C'est moi, Maman. C'est moi.
Jonah ?
Je me sens tellement perdu.
J'ai marché pendant des années,
à essayer de rentrer.
Je suis désolé.
Pourquoi ?
Cette nuit là, j'étais en retard.
Je suis désolé.
Les choses que j'ai vues, Maman...
C'est bon !
Ça prendra du temps
Ça va aller.
Vous devez laisser Jonah, maintenant.
- Quoi ?
- Helen, je vais bien.
C'est pour votre bien.
Non, je le ramène chez moi !
Nikki, calmez-vous.
Vous ne pouvez pas le ramener.
Je sais m'occuper de mon enfant.
Je leur dirai que c'est mon père.
Je peux m'occuper de lui !
C'est impossible.
C'est mon fils, c'est moi qui décide.
Jonah ?
- Ça recommence.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
Il commence la descente.
Qu'est-ce qu'une descente ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Vous l'avez vu dans une bonne phase.
Elle raccourcit chaque jour.
Vous devriez vraiment partir.
Helen...
Je suis là, chéri. Ça va.
Arrêtez-ça.
J'aimerais pouvoir.
S'il vous plaît, vous devriez partir.
Je ne pars pas. Pas sans lui.
Alors éloignez-vous.
Pourquoi ? Dites-moi pourquoi !
Je n'avais jamais entendu un son pareil.
Un hurlement primaire.
Il dure 20 heures par jour.
Avant que la brèche ne le ramène,
Jonah a vu le coeur d'une étoile noire.
Ce qu'il a vu l'a rendu fou.
Une semaine plus tard.
Ils disent que vous pouvez passer
quand vous voulez.
Quand il est dans une bonne phase.
Promettez-moi de ne faire ça
à personne d'autre.
Avant, j'avais son souvenir.
Dès que je pensais à lui,
je le voyais rire avec ses amis,
jouer au foot,
avaler son petit déjeuner.
Maintenant j'entends seulement cet...
cet horrible bruit.
Je croyais que vous vouliez savoir
ce qui lui était arrivé.
En effet.
J'avais tort.
C'était mieux de ne pas savoir.
Avant de vous rencontrer...
J'avais de l'espoir.
Des excuses ?
Ce soir, on parle de ce que tu veux.
Les enfants...
Notre futur, tout ce que tu veux.
Ça va ?
Viens là.
Je suis désolée.
Tu veux t'asseoir ?
Maintenant...
raconte-moi tout.
Depuis le début.
Il y a cette femme, Nikki.
Elle avait un fils...
Jonah.
Il a disparu il y a 7 mois...
Certaines personnes pensent
que juste avant de mourir
on voit sa vie défiler devant ses yeux.
Des explosifs.
Bam.

Torchwood.
Outside the
government,beyond the police.
Fighting for the future on
behalf of the human race.
The 21st century is when everything
changes and Torchwood is ready.
Gwen,weve texted you the location,
were querying four or five signs
of life,definitely non-human.
Get here as soon as you can.
So,sure theyre not Weevils?
Dont think so,different energy
patterns,cant make sense of it.
Not a species weve encountered before.
Lets hope theyre friendly.
Owen,Ianto,take the other side of
the building,check the upper floors.
Toshiko with me.
OK? Go!
Im getting mirror
readings on both floors.
One creature at either
end of the building.
Toshiko,split up.
Yknow,these creatures are very quiet.
Maybe theyre sleeping.
Or hatching.
Or maybe they arent creatures at all.
Just explosive devices.
Snap.

Shit.
You have one message.
Gwen,weve texted you the location,
- were querying four or five signs of life.
- Shit.
1,392 deaths earlier
Oh,not again.
Ladies.
Torso of steel,shilling a feel.
Any takers?
Bar fight,got a little out of control.
Flesh wound.
Still not used to...
these hangovers.
Captain Jack Harkness.
How long have you been there?
Silent types. Thats OK.
I used to date a guy with no mouth.
Surprisingly creative.
Listen,you only had to ask.
Can we get a room though?
When I said about getting a
room,I meant somewhere with linen.
Time was,electrodes to the nipples
meant the start of a good night.
Full power charge and still breathing.
Pretty advanced piece of
equipment you got there.
You ladies are ahead of yourselves.
Now where the hell am I?
Put that down before somebody gets...
Why arent you dead yet?
Been trying to figure that out myself.
Weve been monitoring you.
Youve been killed 14 times
in the last six months.
Feels like more than that.
Whos the Doctor?
No idea.
"The Doctor,hell be able to fix me"
"When the Doctor turns
up,itll all be put right"
"You wait till I see the Doctor.
"First Im going to kiss
him,then Im going to kill him."
Transcripts of your conversations with
strangers,in various drinking dens,
since you first came to our attention.
Yknow,no-one
likes a smart-ass.
Tell us where he is
and well release you.
Why do you wanna know?
Youre in Torchwood,Cardiff.
The Torchwood Institute was created to
combat the threat posed by the Doctor
and other phantasmagoria.
Hes not a threat.
The Doctors the one wholl save
you from your phantasmahoojits.
Just tell us his location.
I dont know!
He left me behind.
I came here to find him.
He refuels from that rift you have.
Hoping if I stayed here long
enough,wed find each other.
Now,can I go?
No.
You cant keep me here!
Oh,we can.
- Unless...
- Yes.
Unless.
Unless what?
There are opportunities here.
With the Institute.
Im not for hire.
Youre going to need currency.
Whats the assignment?
Missing person.
Well,when we say person...
I havent done anything!
Burglaries,joyriding a horse
and carriage,pick-pocketing,
24 instances of consuming
food without paying for it.
********
Ill make it up,I promise!
Ah,too late.
Its just a bit of fun.
This planets a century away from
official first contact with alien life.
Youre upsetting the schedule.
Who are you?
Im Torchwood.
I said sorry!
You cant lock me up!
Hes just a kid. Send him
back to where he came from.
If only we could.
The rift only goes one way.
What do you do?
Observe and profile the species and
then transfer them to long term storage?
Why?
It was a threat to the Empire.
Like me?
Youre our ally now.
If you dont want it...
Your next assignment.
No.
Im through with you people.
Your liberty is at our discretion.
Work for us,you assist the Empire.
Sever that tie,you become a threat.
And youve seen how we deal with threats.
Its good money,Captain.
How else are you going to earn?
See what you think in the morning.
Hes pretty.
But youre prettier.
Can I read your cards?
No,thank you.
No,really.
Hes coming.
The one youre looking for.
But the century will turn twice
before you find each other again.
Are you for real?
You mean I have to wait
100 years to find him?
Whatll I do in the meantime?
{\a6}New Year's Eve 1999
Some parts of the world have
already welcomed in the New Year.
Our cameras,of course,have been
out in force across the UK tonight.
Lets take you first to Cardiff.
Hey,when you joked
about the Millennium Bug,
I didnt realise it was gonna
have 18 legs stacked with poison.
Anyone home?
You know youre supposed
to party like its...
Alex?
Jack!
Just in time.
Alex what happened? Who did this?
Me.
What?
Why?
We got it wrong,Jack.
We thought we could
control the stuff we found.
And whats it brought us?
So much death.
What happened to them?
Its good youre here.
Always did have great timing.
This place,its yours.
Torchwood Three,my gift to you,Jack,for
a century of service as field operative.
Give this place a purpose.
Before its too late. Please.
Alex,listen,its gonna be OK.
No. Its not.
Its really not.
I looked inside.
It showed me whats coming.
They were mercy killings.
It was the kindest thing I could do.
So none of us see the storm.
Im sorry I cant do the same for you.
21st century,Jack.
Everythings gonna change.
- And were not ready.
- Alex!
He was dead.
- I checked his pulse!He was dead!
- All right!
Jack,what has happened?
Where are the others?
What is he doing here?
Look,I was late,OK. He
gave me a lift.You OK?
Toshiko.
She went the other way.
5 years earlier
Never thought Id say this to
anyone here,but you work too hard.
Another hour and Im done.
Wish the rest of them thought like you.
Half past five,theyre out
of here like a pack of dogs.
You have a good evening,sir.
I doubt it.
Another late one,Miss Sato.
You know me,George.
Married to the job.
When you gonna let me whisk
you away from all this?
As soon as you clear it with
your wife and grandchildren.
Always an excuse.
Take care.
Goodnight,George.
LODMOOR RESEARCH FACILITY
- Ive got it.
- Get in.
I want to see my mother.
I want to know shes safe. Now.
Show me the piece.
Oh,its beautiful.
Perfect sonic modulator.
Toshiko,youve done so well.
Toshiko!
Youve got what you want.
Now let her go.
Except now youre the
victim of your own success.
Perfectly situated,proven ability.
You can give us so much more.
And what if I refuse?
Then your mother stays with us.
And your brilliance is used against her.
- Like this.
- No,dont!
Turn it off! Turn it off!
My mother!
Is she all right? Is she all right?
This is a UNIT facility.
Your rights as a citizen
have been withdrawn.
You will be held here indefinitely.
We are not required to provide
you with legal representation.
Anything you say will be recorded.
You will be allowed no
communication with any person
or organisation outside this facility.
There is no right of appeal.
If you fail to comply with the rules,we
are authorised to discipline you.
Is my mother safe?
We cannot supply you
with that information.
Prisoner Sato. Inspection.
What for?
Prepare for inspection.
Caterings as lousy as they say,huh?
- Wheres my mother?
- Shes safe.
She wont remember being kidnapped.
I wiped it from her memory.
I hope you dont mind.
You did what?
Really,just a little pill.
Shell never have known.
- Who are you?
- Nobody.
I dont exist.
And for a man with my charisma,that
is quite an achievement.
Are you a lawyer?
Do I look like a lawyer?
Theyre gonna make an example of you.
Stealing official
secrets,in todays climate...
Theyre going to keep
you here without charge.
Forever.
- They cant do that.
- Theyre never going to release you.
Im sorry.
You made this,right?
I just followed the plans.
Yeah,kinda.
But first you had to grasp the
concept of what a sonic modulator does.
Most people would struggle with that.
And another thing...
the plans dont work.
What?
The technical plans you
followed,they were wrong.
They had mistakes in them.
Thats why the plans were shelved.
But you,Toshiko Sato,you
automatically fixed things as you went.
What Im trying to say is...
oh baby,youre good.
I mean,youre good now.
Imagine what youd be like
with a little training.
Shame youre gonna be
locked up for so long.
- Youve got to get me out of here.
- If...
you come work for me.
Really?
Give me five years,Ill get
them to wipe your record clean.
They owe me a few favours.
What do you do?
Protect people.
Least,thats what Im aiming for.
Its kind of a work in progress.
- What about my mother?
- Limited contact only.
You can send her postcards.
So what dyou say?
Why would you trust me?
Instinct.
Its going to be dangerous.
Think you can bear a little danger?
Stop! Stop!Stop!
Tosh,are you OK?
Youre making it worse.
Its pushing down even more now.
I think Ive broken my arm.
- Gwen.
- Yeah?
If this pillar shifts down
even more,itll crush me.
*******
Were gonna need more strength.
Look,Jack has gone to
find Owen and Ianto.
Youre gonna be fine,all right.
Youve gotta hurry,please.
Go help Jack. Ill stay here.
- Are you sure?
- Yep.
Im going to come back
for you darling,all right?
Youre going to be OK.
Gwen,this couldve been you,couldnt
it? If you hadnt been late.
I havent got time for this
now. Ive got to find the others.
Ianto!
Ianto!
21 months earlier
Thanks.
No,thank you.
And you are?
Jones,Ianto Jones.
Nice to meet you,Jones,Ianto Jones.
Capn Jack Harkness.
Lucky escape.
I had it under control.
You think so?
It looked pretty vicious.
Youre,um...
You were bleeding.
Had worse from shaving.
Looked like a Weevil to me.
Ive no idea what youre talking about.
Ill take him from here.
Thanks for the assistance.
Anytime.
By the way,love the coat.
Morning.
Coffee?
I want to work for
you. Sorry.No vacancies.
Look,let me tell you about myself.
Ianto Jones,born August 19th 1983.
Able student but not exceptional,one minor
conviction for shoplifting in your teens.
Number of temporary
jobs,mainly a drifter,
until two years ago you join the
Torchwood Institute in London.
Junior researcher.
- Girlfriend,Lisa Hallett.
- Deceased.
Im sorry.
Look,you checked me out.
You knew what a Weevil was.
Thought I was gonna have
to come deal with you.
I have the right
qualifications for the job.
There is no job.
Were nothing to do
with Torchwood London.
I severed all links.
Yet when it burned,two members
of your team scavenged the ruins.
Dont want the equipment
getting into the wrong hands.
And youre the right hands,are you?
Trial period,three months.
No.
Three weeks. Three days.
Let me prove myself to you.
- Ill work for nothing.
- No.
I saw what they did at Canary Wharf.
What am I supposed to
do with those memories?
You are not my responsibility.
And were not hiring.
Same time tomorrow then.
There is no job for you
here and there never will be.
I really like that coat.
Toshiko,see if you can
decode those hieroglyphics.
Already on it.
Owen,take a cross section
of the paramedics brain,
check it against the
list of chemical agents.
Will do.
Susie,were going to need
to dredge the reservoir.
See if you can find the other half.
OK,this has to stop.
No,listen to me.
I dont have time for this.
I dont care what your problem is,I
want you out of this city by sunrise.
There is no place for you here.
Go back to London,find
yourself another life.
Keep stalking me,Ill wipe your memory.
No,but the thing is...
Any conversation between us,no
matter what the subject,is over!******
Im getting back behind the wheel of
that car and if youre still in the road,
Im going to drive through you.
Youre not gonna help me
catch this pterodactyl then?
OK,that is the only
special equipment youve got?
Yeah,cos I keep dinosaur
nets in the back of the SUV.
Torchwood London wouldve.
How did you find it?
Rift activity locator.
Torchwood London.
See,quality kit.
Yeah,its quite excitable.
Must be your aftershave.
Never wear any.
You smell like that naturally?
51st century pheromones.
You people have no idea.
Ready for another go?
Im game if you are.
Three,two,one...
Split up!
Were not gonna harm you.
You cant stay here.
Come back with me.
Ive got somewhere nice and
big where you can fly around.
OK,so youll let the
pterodactyl in and not me.
We need a guard dog.
I can be that.
Like a receptionist.
Building maintenance,food
and drink,dry cleaning even.
That coat of yours
must take a battering.
Like a butler,I could be a butler.
We dont need a butler.
Excuse me,dried egg on your collar.
It was a busy week.
What exactly is your plan?
Im going to be the decoy.
And it will rip you to shreds.
Dinosaurs?
Had em for breakfast.
Had to,only source of pre-killed food
protein after the asteroid crashed.
Long story. Here you go.
One injection to the
central nervous cortex.
Ill keep it occupied. Move.
- No.
- What?
It knows me. Ill be a better decoy.
No,way too dangerous.
No,Ive got a secret weapon. Chocolate.
Preferably dark.
I got your favourite,yeah.
Its good for your serotonin levels.
If youve got serotonin levels.
Ianto!
Sorry!
I should go.
Report for work... first thing tomorrow.
Like the suit,by the way.
Ready? One,two three...Come on.
- You OK?
- My shoulder.
I think its dislocated.
- Can you take this?
- Yeah.
Take a deep breath.
Where are the others?
We need your help to get Toshiko out.
- Owen?
- No sign yet.
If anything happens
he cant repair himself.
Of course,he cant heal,can he?
OK,well help Rhys with Toshiko.
Let us know when you find Owen.
- And be careful.
- OK.
OK? All right?
4 years earlier
Oh,go
on,please,please,please,please,please!
No,you dont even like her,ever since she didnt
pay for her share of the Chinese in Leicester.
Yeah,but we want Julia to come and itll
look odd if we invite one without the other.
Oh,please,help me God!
Three tables done. Nine more to go.
You wanna back out?
Its still not too late.
Listen,Im marrying you
even if it kills me. OK?
Good.
Do you want a cup of tea?
Yeah,Ill make one.
I think I can manage.
- Katie.
- Yeah?
- Um,water.
- Yeah.
From the kettle.
Milk.
Stop nagging me! I
dont want to have milk.
Ive never liked milk. I want to have...
Tea.
I wanna have tea without...
Milk.
Tea without milk.
Darling,its all right. Its all right.
I got your invitation.
Still going ahead?
I promised her a summer wedding.
Before all this.
This changes nothing.
Owen,it will change everything.
You dont know for certain.
Weve been through Kates test results more
times than any patient in my whole career.
*****
All the evidence suggests she
has early onset Alzheimers.
The youngest case in medical history.
It doesnt mean were wrong.
Please... run more tests.
Lets just try one more MRI scan.
An MRI isnt going to
make any difference.
You dont know that.
You have said yourself that this
is unlike any case that youve seen,
- and maybe youve missed something.
- Owen...
You dont understand,Jim,OK.
One day shes fine,shes perfect memory,the old
Katie,and the next theres nothing,shes blank.
Now,I am losing her and I dont
know what to do about that,OK?
So please.
Whats the point of me doing this
job if I cant help my own fiancee?
Ill see what I can do.
Thank you,Jim.
Its like being lost,in a place you know
really well,but you cant get your bearings.
Sometimes it comes back
to you. And sometimes...
Im sorry,Owen.
Whatve you got to be sorry for?
I dont want to put you through this.
Last night,I dreamt that you left me.
Oh,come on.
Nobodys leaving anyone.
How is that possible?
We dont know.
Ive never seen anything like it.
Its not the brain deteriorating.
Its a clear physical tumour.
That wasnt there last week?
Not that we saw.
You were right to ask for another scan.
So what do we do now?
We have to view this as good news.
Katie,we need to take you into surgery,soon
as possible,and remove the tumour.
Dyou understand?
Katie.
I cant remember your name.
Are you sure shes up to this?
Were going to do
everything we can for her.
Im sorry.
Who the hell are you?
You should prepare for the worst.
No,you cant go in there.
Oh,my God!
Katie.
What is it?
Im sorry. I tried to stop them.
Shes dead.
That thing in her head
is an alien life form.
It incubates in the brain,disrupting
the shape and functions.
When its attacked or threatened,it
emits a toxic gas thats fatal to humans.
It clears pretty quickly.
She cant be dead. She cant be dead.
Im calling,calling the police.
Tell them that Torchwood is
already here and dealing with it.
Thatll save them a call-out.
I need to take her brain back with me.
Dont touch her!
- How are you feeling?
- Where is she?
- Wheres who?
- Katie.
Katie Russell,shes a junior doctor,she
works here,were about to get married.
- Lets get you back into bed.
- Get off me.
Where is she?
Where is she?
Where is she?
He was wearing a military uniform.
He had an American accent.
We have checked all
the security footage.
There was no such man.
Jim Garrett was poisoned by
some alien toxin,by some...
Jim Garrett was in a car accident.
The American said that he wanted
her brain,that there was...
alien creature,or...
This happened,OK?
This is not some trauma or delayed
grief or whatever youre scribbling down.
Katies tumour was inoperable.
There was nothing
anyone could have done.
This is just wrong.
Im giving you three
months prescribed rest.
Dont come into work.
Yeah!
This isnt right.
He was there.
It wasnt just me.
He was there too.
That is not what happened!
That is... not what happened.
You!
You couldve saved her!
You couldve saved her!
You couldve... saved her!
I couldnt.
I really couldnt.
If youre not a figment of my imagination,then
I dont know whats happening any more.
Maybe this is...
what a mental breakdown feels like.
Youre fine.
Its the rest of the
world thats delusional.
Why her?
Theres no reason.
Your life doesnt end with her.
What are you gonna do now?
Go back to work? See echoes
of her in every corridor?
You need a purpose.
Im building something.
I need a medic.
And you want me?
You made them take more scans.
You kept trying to track me down.
You dont give up easily.
I need someone like that
to work with me in Cardiff.
To fight aliens.
Exactly.
Look...
I dunno what happened to Katie
and I dunno who you really are,
but there is no such thing as aliens.
You think?
Im having a breakdown.
Mental collapse.
Owen,why did you become a doctor?
I thought if I could save one
life,mine would be worthwhile.
But you save one... and
theres another.And another.
All clawing at
you,demanding to be saved.
And even if you do succeed,you
can never save enough.
Maybe here you can.
- How are the others?
- All right.
Careful!
If that falls...
OK,its not going to fall...
- OK.
- Just be very careful.
OK,all right,all right.
Were gonna get you out.
OK,this one?
- Look,if you do it very,very gently...
- OK.
It isnt going to drop on you.
- Quiet.
- OK,sorry.
Im going to do this
as quickly as possible.
Listen to me. Im going
to get you out of this.
Look at me,trust me.
- OK,hold my hands.
- Sorry.
Hold my hands!
You OK?
You all right?
Tosh,what happened?
Broken arm,bruised ribs,about an inch
away from being crushed by a girder.
- You were lucky.
- We all were.
Jack,whos done this?
And wheres the SUV?
Oh,no.
Jack,what does he want?
Oh,deja vu!
Or did I say that already?
Hey,team.
Course,there might be a
few less of you by now.
Dont know if you liked my little gift.
Course,you cant die.
And with all that life,all that
time,you cant spare any for me.
Say hi to the family.
No... it cant be.
Been a while since youve
seen your brother,eh,Jack.
Gray?
OK,heres whats going to happen.
Everything you love,everything
you treasure will die.
Im going to tear your world apart,
Captain Jack Harkness,piece by piece.
Starting now.
Maybe now youll wanna
spend some time with me.
This was a targeted attack.
The beast killed the
four most senior officers.
If it gets out what happened
therell be city-wide panic.
Lets get ourselves a good view.
What have you done?
Were going to put the city
back together,find Jack...
and punish John.
Its completely crippled us.
Youre no fun.
Owen,get out of there.
What have you done with my brother?
This is going to get nasty.
What if this is how it ends?

Torchwood.
Au delà du gouvernement
et de la police.
Ils se battent pour le futur
de l'humanité.
C'est au 21ème siècle que tout bascule.
Et Torchwood est prêt
Gwen, on vient de t'envoyer
les coordonnées.
On reçoit 4 ou 5 signes de vie,
définitivement non humains.
Rejoins-nous dès que possible.
Tu es sûr que ce ne sont pas
des Weevils ?
Je ne pense pas. Structure différente,
ça ne ressemble à rien de connu.
Ce n'est pas une espèce
qu'on a déjà rencontrée.
Espérons qu'ils sont amicaux.
Owen, Ianto, couvrez l'autre côté
du bâtiment et les étages supérieurs.
Toshiko, avec moi.
OK ?
On y va.
Je reçois des signaux identiques
sur chaque étage.
Une créature à chaque bout du bâtiment.
Toshiko, on se sépare.
Ces créatures sont très silencieuses.
Elles dorment peut-être.
Ou elles incubent.
Ou bien ce ne sont peut-être
pas du tout des créatures.
Juste des explosifs.
Bam.

Merde.
<i>Vous avez un nouveau message.</i>
<i>Gwen, on vient de t'envoyer
les coordonnées.</i>
- On reçoit 4 ou 5 signes de vie.
- Merde.
<i>1392 morts plus tôt.</i>
Oh, pas encore...
Mesdames.
Torse de fer, tant de choses à faire.
Des preneuses ?
Bataille de bar, ça a un peu dérapé.
Blessure superficielle.
Toujours pas l'habitude de...
Ces gueules de bois.
Capitaine Jack Harkness.
Depuis quand êtes-vous là ?
Silencieuses ? Ça me va.
Je suis sorti avec un mec sans bouche.
Extrêmement créatif.
Il suffisait de demander.
On pourrait prendre une chambre ?
Quand je parlais d'une chambre,
j'entendais avec du linge.
Il fut un temps où des électrodes sur
les tétons étaient un bon début de nuit.
Charge maximale, il respire toujours.
Vous avez là un équipement
plutôt avancé.
Vous êtes en avance sur votre temps.
Où suis-je ?
Baissez-ça avant que quelqu'un ne...
Pourquoi n'êtes-vous pas mort ?
Je me le demande souvent.
Nous vous surveillions.
Vous avez été tué 14 fois
ces 6 derniers mois.
J'aurais dit plus.
Qui est le Docteur ?
Aucune idée.
"Le Docteur, il saura me guérir."
"Quand le Docteur arrivera,
il remettra tout en ordre."
"Attendez que je vois le Docteur."
"D'abord, je l'embrasserai.
Ensuite, je le tuerai."
Extraits de vos conversations avec
des étrangers dans diverses tanières
depuis que vous avez attiré
notre attention.
Personne n'aime les Miss "Je sais tout".
Dites-nous où il est
et nous vous relâcherons.
Pourquoi ça vous intéresse ?
Vous êtes à Torchwood, Cardiff.
L'Institut Torchwood a été créé pour
combattre la menace du Docteur,
et autres fantasmagories.
Il n'est pas une menace.
C'est le Docteur qui vous sauvera
de vos fantasmatrucs.
Dites-nous où il se trouve.
Je ne sais pas !
Il est parti sans moi.
Je suis venu ici le trouver.
Il fait le plein grâce à votre brèche.
J'espérais le trouver en restant
ici assez longtemps.
Maintenant, je peux partir ?
Non.
Vous ne pouvez pas me garder.
Oh, si.
- A moins que...
- Oui.
A moins que...
A moins que quoi ?
Il y a des opportunités ici.
Avec l'Institut.
Je ne cherche pas de travail.
Il va vous falloir de l'argent.
Quelle est ma mission ?
Une personne disparue.
Enfin, quand on dit personne...
Je n'ai rien fait !
4 cambriolages, un vol de cheval
et calèche, 7 cas de vols dans la rue.
Consommation de nourriture
sans payer à 24 reprises.
C'est une vraie addiction
chez votre espèce.
Je me rattraperai, promis.
Trop tard.
C'est juste pour m'amuser.
Cette planète est à un siècle du
premier contact extraterrestre officiel.
Vous perturbez le planning.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Je suis Torchwood.
Je me suis excusé !
Vous ne pouvez pas m'enfermer.
Ce n'est qu'un enfant.
Renvoyez-le de là où il vient.
Si seulement.
La brèche ne marche que dans un sens.
Alors que faites-vous ?
Observation de l'espèce avant transfert
vers un lieu de séjour à long terme ?
Pourquoi ?
Il constituait une menace
pour l'Empire.
Comme moi ?
Vous êtes maintenant notre allié.
Si vous n'en voulez pas...
Votre prochaine mission.
Non.
J'en ai fini avec vous.
Votre liberté est soumise
à notre décision.
Travaillez pour nous,
et vous assistez l'Empire.
Coupez ce lien,
et vous devenez une menace.
Et vous avez vu
ce que nous en faisons.
C'est beaucoup d'argent, Capitaine.
Comment en gagnerez-vous autrement ?
Repensez-y.
Il est mignon.
Mais tu l'es davantage.
Je vous lis vos cartes ?
Non merci.
Non, vraiment.
Il arrive.
Celui que vous cherchez.
Mais le siècle changera deux fois
avant que vous ne vous trouviez.
Tu es réelle ?
Tu veux dire que je dois attendre
encore 100 ans avant de le trouver ?
Qu'est-ce que je vais faire
entre temps ?
<i>Réveillon du Nouvel An 1999</i>
<i>Certaines parties du monde ont
déjà célébré la nouvelle année.</i>
<i>Nos caméras, bien sûr, sont de
sortie dans tout le Royaume-Uni.</i>
<i>Voyons d'abord Cardiff.</i>
Quand vous plaisantiez à propos
du Bug du Millénaire,
je pensais pas que ça serait vraiment
un insecte aux 18 pattes empoisonnées.
Il y a quelqu'un ?
Vous savez qu'on est censés
faire la fête comme...
Alex ?
Jack !
Juste à temps.
Alex, que s'est-il passé ?
Qui a fait ça ?
Moi.
Quoi ?
Pourquoi ?
On s'est trompés, Jack.
On croyait pouvoir contrôler
ce qu'on trouvait.
Et qu'est-ce que ça nous a apporté ?
Que de morts.
Que leur est-il arrivé ?
C'est bien que tu sois là.
Tu as toujours eu un bon timing.
Cet endroit,
Il est à toi.
Torchwood Trois,
Mon cadeau pour toi.
Pour un siècle de service,
Comme agent de terrain
Donne à cet endroit un but.
Avant que ce ne soit trop tard.
S'il te plaît.
Alex, écoute
Ça va aller.
Non. Pas du tout.
Vraiment pas.
J'ai regardé à l'intérieur.
Ça m'a montré le futur.
C'était des meurtres préventifs.
C'était la meilleure chose
que je puisse faire.
Pour qu'aucun de nous
ne voie la tempête.
Désolé de ne pas pouvoir
en faire autant pour toi.
Le 21ème siècle, Jack.
Tout va changer.
- Et on n'est pas prêts.
- Alex !
Il était mort !
- Il n'avait plus de pouls !
- C'est bon !
Jack, que s'est-il passé ?
Où sont les autres ?
Que fait-il ici ?
J'étais en retard.
Il m'a amenée. Ça va ?
Toshiko.
Elle est partie de l'autre côté.
<i>5 ans plus tôt.</i>
Je n'aurais jamais pensé dire ça ici,
mais vous travaillez trop dur.
Encore une heure et j'aurai fini.
Si seulement ils pensaient tous
comme vous.
Cinq heure et quart, ils se ruent
hors d'ici comme des moutons.
Passez une bonne soirée, monsieur.
Ça m'étonnerait.
Vous finissez encore tard, Miss Sato.
Vous me connaissez bien, George.
Mariée à mon boulot.
Quand me laisserez-vous
vous délivrer de tout ça ?
Dès que vous en aurez parlé
à votre femme et petits-enfants.
Toujours une excuse.
Prenez soin de vous.
Bonne nuit, George.
LODMOOR RESEARCH FACILITY
- Je l'ai.
- Entrez.
Je veux voir ma mère.
Je veux être sûre qu'elle est en vie.
Maintenant.
Montrez-moi l'objet.
Magnifique.
Un parfait modulateur sonique.
Toshiko, vous avez été parfaite.
Toshiko !
Vous avez ce que vous voulez.
Laissez-la partir.
Mais vous êtes maintenant
victime de votre propre succès.
En parfaite position,
capacités prouvées.
Vous pouvez nous apporter
tant de choses.
Et si je refuse ?
Votre mère restera avec nous.
Et votre intelligence sera utilisée
contre elle.
- Comme ça.
- Non !
Eteignez-ça !
Ma mère !
Comment va-t-elle ?
<i>Vous êtes dans un bâtiment UNIT.</i>
<i>Vos droits en tant que citoyen
ont été révoqués.</i>
<i>Vous serez retenue ici indéfiniment.</i>
<i>Nous n'avons pas à vous fournir
de représentation légale.</i>
<i>Tout ce que vous direz sera enregistré.</i>
<i>Vous n'aurez droit à aucun
contact avec des personnes</i>
<i>ou organisations en dehors
de ce bâtiment.</i>
<i>Vous ne pouvez faire appel.</i>
<i>Si vous ne vous pliez pas aux règles,
nous sommes autorisés à vous dresser.</i>
Est-ce que ma mère est en sécurité ?
<i>Nous ne pouvons vous
fournir cette information.</i>
<i>Prisonnier Sato. Inspection.</i>
A quoi bon ?
<i>Préparez vous à l'inspection.</i>
La nourriture est aussi mauvaise
qu'ils le disent ?
- Où est ma mère ?
- En sécurité.
Elle ne se rappellera pas
de son enlèvement.
Je l'ai effacé de sa mémoire.
J'espère que ça ne vous dérange pas.
Vous avez fait quoi ?
C'est juste une pilule.
Elle ne s'en rappellera pas.
- Qui êtes-vous ?
- Personne.
Je n'existe pas.
Et pour un homme de mon charisme,
c'est un bel exploit.
Vous êtes avocat ?
Je ressemble à un avocat ?
Ils vont vous prendre pour exemple.
Voler des documents top secrets,
vu le climat de nos jours...
Ils vont vous garder ici
sans charge.
Pour toujours.
- Ils ne peuvent pas...
- Ils ne vous libéreront jamais.
Je suis désolé.
Vous avez fabriqué ceci, non ?
Je n'ai fait que suivre les plans.
Oui, en quelque sorte.
Vous avez d'abord dû comprendre
le concept d'un modulateur sonique.
La plupart des gens
auraient du mal avec ça.
Et autre chose...
Les plans ne marchent pas.
Quoi ?
Les plans techniques que
vous avez suivis étaient faux.
Ils contenaient des erreurs.
C'est pourquoi ils avaient
abandonné ces plans.
Mais vous, Toshiko Sato,
Vous avez automatiquement
réparé ces erreurs
Ce que je veux dire, c'est...
Oh, ma belle, vous êtes forte.
Vous êtes forte maintenant.
Imaginez ce que ça serait
avec un peu d'entraînement.
Dommage que vous soyez enfermée
pour si longtemps.
- Vous devez me faire sortir.
- Si...
vous venez travailler pour moi.
Vraiment ?
Offrez-moi 5 ans.
Je leur ferai effacer votre dossier.
Ils me doivent quelques services.
Que faites-vous ?
Je protège les gens.
Enfin, c'est mon but.
C'est un travail en cours, si l'on veut.
- Et ma mère ?
- Contact limité.
Vous pourrez lui envoyer
des cartes postales.
Qu'en dites-vous ?
Pourquoi me faire confiance ?
L'instinct.
Ça va être dangereux.
Vous pourrez supporter
un peu de danger ?
Arrêtez !
Tosh, ça va ?
Vous empirez les choses.
Ça s'affaisse encore plus.
Je crois que j'ai le bras cassé.
- Gwen.
- Oui ?
Si ce pilier s'affaisse encore,
il m'écrasera.
Ça ne sert à rien, Gwen.
Il nous faut de l'aide.
Jack est parti trouver Owen et Ianto.
Ça va aller, ma chérie. Ça va aller.
Dépêche-toi, s'il te plaît.
Va aider Jack. Je reste là.
- Sûr ?
- Oui.
Je reviens te voir, chérie.
Ça va aller.
Ça va aller.
Gwen, ça aurait pu être toi ?
Si tu n'avais pas été en retard.
C'est pas le moment, Rhys.
Je dois trouver les autres.
Ianto !
Ianto !
<i>21 mois plus tôt.</i>
Merci.
Non, merci à vous.
Et vous êtes ?
Jones, Ianto Jones.
Ravi de vous rencontrer,
Jones, Ianto Jones.
Capitaine Jack Harkness.
Belle évasion.
Je contrôlais la situation.
Vraiment ?
Ça semblait assez brutal.
Vous...
Vous étiez ouvert.
J'ai vu pire en me rasant.
On dirait bien un Weevil.
Je ne sais pas du tout
de quoi vous parlez.
Je m'en occupe.
Merci pour votre aide.
Quand vous voulez.
Au fait, j'adore votre manteau.
Bonjour !
Du café ?
- Je veux travailler pour vous.
- Désolé, pas de poste libre.
Laissez-moi vous parler de moi.
Ianto Jones, né le 19 Août 1983.
Etudiant capable mais pas exceptionnel
Une condamnation mineure pour vol
à l'étalage durant l'adolescence.
Un bon nombre de petits jobs,
vous bougiez beaucoup,
jusqu'à ce que vous rejoigniez il y a
2 ans l'Institut Torchwood à Londres.
Apprenti chercheur.
- Petite amie, Lisa Hallett.
- Décédée.
Désolé.
Vous vous êtes renseigné sur moi.
Vous saviez ce qu'est un Weevil.
Je pensais devoir m'occuper de vous.
Et vous avez vu que je suis
qualifié pour ce boulot.
Il n'y a pas de boulot.
Nous n'avons rien à voir
avec Torchwood Londres.
J'ai coupé tout lien.
Mais quand ça a brûlé,
2 d'entre vous ont parcouru les ruines.
On ne voulait pas que l'équipement
tombe entre de mauvaises mains.
Et vous êtes les bonnes mains ?
Période d'essai, 3 mois.
Non.
3 semaines. 3 jours.
Laissez-moi faire mes preuves.
- Je travaillerai à l'oeil.
- Non.
J'ai vu ce qu'ils ont fait
à Canary Wharf.
Qu'est-ce que je suis censé
faire de ces souvenirs ?
Vous n'êtes pas ma responsabilité.
Et on ne recherche personne.
Même heure demain, dans ce cas.
Il n'y a pas de travail pour vous ici,
et il n'y en aura jamais.
J'aime vraiment ce manteau.
Toshiko, essaye de déchiffrer
ces hiéroglyphes.
Je suis dessus.
Owen, prends une section transversale
du cerveau paramédical,
compare-la à la liste
d'agents chimiques.
C'est comme fait.
Susie, il va falloir remonter
le réservoir.
Essaye de trouver l'autre moitié.
Bien, ça doit s'arrêter.
Non, écoutez-moi.
Je n'ai pas le temps pour ça.
Je me fiche de vos problèmes,
je vous veux hors de la ville
au lever du soleil
Vous n'avez pas de place ici.
Retournez à Londres et
trouvez-vous une autre vie.
Si vous continuez à me harceler,
j'effacerai votre mémoire.
Non, c'est juste que...
Toute conversation entre nous,
quel qu'en soit le sujet, est finie.
Kaput ! Pour toujours.
Je retourne au volant de cette voiture,
et si vous êtes toujours sur la route,
je vous foncerai dedans.
Donc vous n'allez pas m'aider
à attraper ce ptérodactyle ?
Vous n'avez que ça comme
équipement spécial ?
Oui, bien sûr je garde les filets
à dinosaures dans le coffre du SUV.
Torchwood Londres l'aurait fait.
Comment l'avez-vous trouvé ?
Localisateur d'activité de la brèche.
Torchwood Londres.
Matériel de qualité.
Il s'excite facilement.
Ça doit être votre après-rasage.
Je n'en mets jamais.
Vous sentez comme ça naturellement ?
Phéromones du 51ème siècle.
Vous n'avez aucune idée...
Prêt pour un autre essai ?
Je le suis si vous l'êtes.
3, 2, 1...
On se sépare !
On ne va pas te faire de mal.
Tu ne peux pas rester ici.
Viens avec moi.
J'ai un bel endroit, assez grand
pour que tu voles tranquille.
Donc vous prenez le ptérodactyle
et pas moi !
Il nous faut un chien de chasse.
Je peux en être un !
Une sorte de réceptionniste.
Entretien des locaux,
nourriture et boissons
Je peux même faire la lessive
Votre manteau doit en prendre un coup.
Majordome,
je pourrais être un majordome.
On n'a pas besoin de majordome.
Excusez-moi, vous avez
de l'oeuf séché sur le col.
La semaine a été bien remplie.
Quel est votre plan ?
Je vais faire l'appât.
Et il vous réduira en miettes.
Un dinosaure ?
J'en ai déjà mangé au petit-déj.
Pas le choix, seule source de nourriture
déjà morte après un crash d'astéroïde.
Longue histoire. Tenez.
Une injection dans le
cortex du centre nerveux.
Je l'occupe. Bougez.
- Non.
- Quoi ?
Il me connaît.
Je ferai un meilleur appât.
Non, bien trop dangereux.
J'ai une arme secrète. Du chocolat.
Noir de préférence.
C'est ton préféré, oui.
C'est bon pour ton taux de sérotonine.
Si tu as un taux de sérotonine.
Ianto !
Désolé !
Je ferais mieux d'y aller.
Présentez-vous au travail
demain à la première heure.
J'aime beaucoup votre costume, au fait.
Prêt ? 1, 2, 3... Allez !
- Ça va ?
- Mon épaule.
Je crois qu'elle est démise.
- Tu peux encaisser ?
- Oui.
Respire un grand coup.
Où sont les autres ?
On a besoin de ton aide
pour dégager Toshiko.
- Owen ?
- Aucun signe pour l'instant.
S'il lui arrive quelque chose,
il ne pourra pas s'en remettre.
Bien sûr, il ne peut pas cicatriser.
OK. On va aider Rhys avec Toshiko.
Préviens-nous dès que tu trouves Owen.
- Et sois prudente.
- OK.
Ça va ?
<i>4 ans plus tôt.</i>
Oh, vas-y, s'il te plaît !
Non, tu ne l'aimes plus
Depuis qu'elle est partie sans payer
sa part de restau à Leicester
Mais on veut que Julia vienne, et on
ne peut pas inviter l'une sans l'autre.
Mon dieu, aidez-moi !
3 tables de faites.
Encore 9 !
Tu veux annuler ?
C'est pas trop tard.
Ecoute, je t'épouserai même
si ça doit me tuer, d'accord ?
Bien.
Tu veux une tasse de thé ?
Oui, je vais en faire une.
Je pense pouvoir y arriver.
- Katie.
- Oui ?
- De l'eau.
- Oui.
Celle de la bouilloire.
Du lait.
Arrête de m'embêter !
Je veux pas de lait.
Je n'ai jamais aimé ça.
Je veux boire mon...
Thé.
Je veux boire mon thé sans...
Lait.
Mon thé sans lait.
Chérie, ça va...
J'ai reçu votre invitation.
Vous le faites quand même ?
Je lui ai promis un mariage en été.
Avant tout ça.
Ça ne change rien.
Owen, ça va tout changer.
Tu ne peux pas en être sûr.
On a étudié les résultats de Kate
plus que ceux de n'importe quel patient.
Tu les as étudiés toi-même.
Tout mène à penser qu'elle a
un Alzheimer précoce.
Le plus jeune cas dans
l'histoire de la médecine.
Ça ne veut pas dire qu'on a tort.
Je t'en prie... Fais d'autres tests.
Essayons un dernier IRM.
Un IRM ne changera rien.
Tu n'en sais rien.
Tu dis toi-même que
tu n'as jamais vu de cas pareil.
- Tu as peut-être loupé quelque chose.
- Owen...
Tu ne comprends pas, Jim.
Elle allait bien, parfaite mémoire,
et du jour au lendemain, plus rien.
Sa mémoire est vierge.
Je suis en train de la perdre,
et je ne sais pas quoi faire.
Alors je t'en prie.
A quoi bon faire ce boulot si je ne
peux même pas aider ma fiancée ?
Je vais voir ce que je peux faire.
Merci, Jim.
C'est comme...
être perdue dans un endroit bien
familier, sans trouver tes repères.
Parfois ça te revient.
Et parfois...
Je suis désolée, Owen.
Pourquoi ?
Je ne veux pas te faire subir ça.
Hier soir, j'ai rêvé que tu me quittais.
Viens là...
Personne ne quitte personne.
Comment est-ce possible ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je n'ai jamais rien vu de tel.
Ce n'est pas le cerveau
qui se détériore.
C'est une tumeur bien physique.
Qui n'était pas là il y a une semaine ?
On ne l'a pas vue.
Tu as eu raison de demander
un nouveau scanner.
Alors, que fait-on ?
Nous devons voir ça
comme une bonne nouvelle.
Katie, on doit te faire opérer
dès que possible et enlever la tumeur.
Tu comprends ?
Katie.
Je ne me rappelle pas ton nom.
Tu es sûr qu'elle est prête ?
On va faire tout notre possible.
Je suis désolé.
Qui êtes-vous ?
J'ai tenté de les prévenir.
Préparez-vous au pire.
Non, vous ne pouvez pas entrer !
Oh mon dieu !
Katie.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Désolé. J'ai essayé de les arrêter.
Elle est morte.
Cette chose dans sa tête est
une forme de vie extraterrestre.
Elle incube dans le cerveau,
bouleversant sa forme et ses fonctions.
Quand elle est attaquée ou menacée,
elle émet un gaz toxique mortel.
Il se dissipe assez vite.
Elle ne peut pas être morte.
J'appelle la police.
Dites-leur que Torchwood est déjà
sur place et s'occupe de tout.
Ça leur évitera un déploiement inutile.
Je dois emporter son cerveau avec moi.
Ne la touchez pas !
- Comment vous sentez-vous ?
- Où est-elle ?
- Qui ?
- Katie.
Katie Russell, elle est interne ici.
On allait se marier.
- Retournez dans votre lit.
- Lâchez-moi.
Où est-elle ?
Où est-elle ?
Il portait un uniforme militaire.
Il avait un accent américain.
Je vous assure. On a vérifié
toutes les vidéos de sécurité.
Cet homme n'y apparaît pas.
Jim Garrett a été empoisonné
par un poison alien, un...
Jim Garrett est mort dans
un accident de voiture.
L'américain a dit qu'il lui fallait
son cerveau, qu'il y avait une...
créature extraterrestre ou...
C'est la vérité, d'accord ?
Ce n'est pas un trauma ou du chagrin à
retardement ou quoi que vous écriviez.
La tumeur de Katie était inopérable.
Personne n'aurait rien pu faire.
C'est faux.
Je vous prescris 3 mois de repos.
Ne venez pas travailler.
C'est ça !
Ce n'est pas normal.
Il était là.
Il n'y avait pas que moi.
Il était là aussi.
Ce n'est pas ce qui s'est passé !
Ce n'est pas ce qui s'est passé.
Vous !
Vous auriez pu la sauver.
Vous auriez pu la sauver.
Vous auriez pu la sauver !
Non.
Vraiment.
Si vous n'êtes pas un fragment
de mon imagination,
Je ne sais vraiment pas ce qui m'arrive.
Peut-être que c'est...
Ce à quoi ressemble
une dépression nerveuse.
Vous allez bien.
C'est le reste du monde qui est
dans l'illusion.
Pourquoi elle ?
Il n'y a aucune raison.
Votre vie ne finit pas avec sa mort.
Qu'allez-vous faire ?
Retourner travailler ? Voir des échos
d'elle dans chaque couloir ?
Il vous faut un but.
Je mets en place quelque chose.
J'ai besoin d'un médecin.
Et vous me voulez moi ?
Vous leur avez demandé
d'autres scanners.
Vous m'avez cherché partout.
Vous n'abandonnez pas facilement.
J'ai besoin de quelqu'un comme ça
pour travailler avec moi à Cardiff.
Pour combattre les extra-terrestres.
Tout à fait.
Ecoutez...
Je ne sais pas ce qui est arrivé à Katie
je ne sais pas qui vous êtes.
Mais les extra-terrestres
n'existent pas.
Vous croyez ?
Je fais une dépression.
Effondrement psychologique.
Owen,
Pourquoi êtes-vous devenu médecin ?
Je pensais que si je pouvais
sauver une vie,
la mienne vaudrait le coup
Mais on en sauve une...
Et il y en a une autre, et une autre.
Qui s'agrippent à vous,
demandant à être sauvées.
Et même si l'on réussit,
on ne peut jamais en sauver assez.
Vous le pourrez peut-être ici.
- Comment vont les autres ?
- Ça va.
Attention !
Si ça tombe...
Ça ne va pas tomber.
- OK.
- Fais très attention.
D'accord.
On va te sortir de là.
Celle-là ?
- Si tu y vas très très doucement...
- OK.
Ça ne va pas te tomber dessus.
- Du calme.
- Désolé.
Je vais faire aussi vite que possible.
Ecoute-moi. Je vais te sortir de là.
Regarde-moi. Fais-moi confiance.
- Prends mes mains.
- Désolé.
Prends mes mains !
Ça va ?
Tout va bien ?
Tosh, qu'est-ce que tu as ?
Bras cassé, côtes fêlées. Quelques cm
de plus et une poutre m'écrasait.
- Tu as eu de la chance.
- On en a tous eu.
Jack, qui a fait ça ?
Et où est le SUV?
Oh, non.
Jack, que veut-il ?
Oh, déjà-vu !
Ou aurais-je déjà dit ça ?
Salut les copains.
Enfin, vous pourriez être
réduits en nombre, maintenant.
J'espère que vous avez aimé
mon petit cadeau.
Evidemment, toi tu ne peux pas mourir.
Et avec toute cette vie, tout ce temps,
tu n'en trouves aucun pour moi.
Dis bonjour à ta famille.
Non... Impossible.
Ça fait un moment que tu n'as
pas vu ton frère, Jack !
Gray ?
Voilà ce qui va se passer.
Tout ce que tu aimes,
tout ce que tu chéris mourra.
Je vais déchirer ton petit monde,
Capitaine Jack Harkness,
morceau après morceau.
Dès maintenant.
Peut-être que tu voudras passer
du temps avec moi, comme ça.
C'était une attaque ciblée.
La bête a tué les 4 agents
les plus âgés.
Si ça sort d'ici, on aura un vent
de panique sur toute la ville.
Allons trouver une bonne vue.
Qu'as-tu fait ?
On va remettre cette ville en ordre,
trouver Jack...
et punir John.
Il nous a totalement handicapés.
Vous êtes pas drôles !
Owen, sors de là.
Qu'as-tu fait de mon frère ?
Ça va mal finir.
Et si c'était comme ça que ça finit ?

Torchwood.
Outside the
Government, beyond the Police.
Fighting for the future on
behalf of the human race.
The 21st century is when everything
changes and Torchwood is ready.
The explosive devices...
Snap!
Jack, who's done this?
Captain John Hart.
Jack, what does he want?
Say hi to the family.
No, it can't be.
Been a while since you've
seen your brother, eh, Jack?
Gray?
Bastard John's taken our SUV.
He's driven it back to Torchwood.
I'm getting readings of rift
activity all over the city.
Major rift flares at St Helen's
Hospital, the Police Headquarters
and the Central IT Server Station.
Hey, Andy?
Gwen, you've gotta get here right now!
I'm serious, we need you.
OK, I'm on my way, all right?
This is him, isn't it? This
Captain John, or whatever.
Rhys, drop Owen at the hospital.
Tosh, Ianto cover the
central server building.
Gwen, the police station.
Then take me to Torchwood.
- Will we all fit?
- Yeah, we have to.
These are traps.
So be careful.
You know what he's capable of.
What about you?
I'm gonna go reason with him!
He just tried to kill us.
I was the only one who
could ever control him.
That's why the Time Agency partnered us.
Did you just say Time Agency?
Don't tell me that's
based in Cardiff too?
Why's he doing this? What does he want?
That's what I'm going to go ask.
<font color=#H6e4bc4>"I Lost My Heart To A
Starship Trooper" by Sarah Brightman</font>
Come on! Sing along!
It's our song!
We don't have a song.
And if we did have a song, it
wouldn't be THIS song.
You're no fun!
Thank you.
I've been here quite
a while, what kept you?
We all survived.
You know, if you're gonna set an
explosion, you need to be more efficient.
Oh, them, they were just
prototypes, had to test out a theory.
How are they all, the little team?
What do you want?
I want you to know that I love you.
Funny way of showing it.
No, seriously.
You have to understand.
I really do love you.
Because this...
is gonna get nasty.

Cardiff City Police HQ 5:27PM
Andy!
They just appeared out of
nowhere, across the whole building.
They weren't human, least not
like any human I've ever seen.
The station's in shock.
Four most senior officers, murdered.
Everyone's running round
like headless chickens.
Rhys, what you doing here?
This is a confidential crime scene.
If what happened here gets
out, there'll be a citywide panic.
Rhys won't go blabbing.
I'm keeping more secrets
than you'd believe.
Like what?
Like a Time Agency. Based in Cardiff!
Oh, it's not based in Cardiff.
Brilliant secret
- I ask, you tell, well done
Bloody hell. What are they?
Weevils
- they live in the sewers.
Tell me you're joking.
- Don't mind if I subdue them, do you?
- Be my guest.
They killed the four
most senior officers.
Almost like it was targeted.
Tosh, report where you are.
Just entering the Central Server.
{a6}Central Server Building 5:36pm
No sign of rift activity yet.
This building houses servers
for the military, police, NHS,
even looks after the server systems
for the nuclear station at Turnmill.
What problem did they report?
Ghosts in these server stacks.
How's the arm?
Owen gave me industrial strength
painkillers, seems to be doing the trick.
Ianto.
Devils! Blasphemers!
Pray to your heathen God.
While in the Lord's
name, we cast you out!
- There we are then.
- Sorted.
Owen, do you have anything to report?
{a6}St.Helen's Hospital 5:39pm
We've got some activity in the basement.
Coming back from a fag break, saw
the door open and there it is!
Chewing through the cables.
So I locked it in.
What the hell is it?
Short answer? It's an alien.
- Alien?
- Yeah.
It's called a Hoix.
The only profile we have
is that it lives to eat.
Caught one in Barry last
year in a kebab shop,
it went through seven
doner sticks in 20 minutes.
Now, have you got the keys?
- What's that?
- All species sedative.
Now, food. You got anything it can eat?
Only these.
Right, perfect! Wish me luck.
Hoixie, where are you?
Come on, porkie. Come
out, come out, wherever you are.
There you are. Look what I've got.
They're actually very tasty.
Get a load of one of these.
That's it, good boy, come to me.
Come on, that's it, try one of these.
You really are quite stupid, aren't you?
Torchwood Hub 6:03pm
*****
*******
**********
Why are you here?
Well, see...
NOW you're interested in me.
It's always the same, nobody
cares until you tie them up.
Number of reasons, actually.
First of all, you were very rude to me.
- What?
- Very rude indeed.
In front of people who barely knew me.
You belittled me.
Can't let that go.
You're serious?
Second
- you have all of time.
Eternity, essentially.
And you still refused
to spend time with me.
After all we've been through
together, after all I've done for you.
Where's Gray?
What've you done with my brother?
You don't realise.
Actions, ramifications, ripples
in the pond.
It's beyond my control.
Beyond your control? Please!
It is.
You need to understand that,
so, localise the rift storms,
a few short sharp shocks...
Don't touch those controls!
Oi, I'm working here!
If you don't want that again, keep quiet.
So, I think we're ready
to find a vantage point.
Whatever you're
planning, we're gonna stop you.
OK.
Go on, then. Stop me.
I hope you can, really.
No?
All right, let's go get
ourselves a good view.
City Centre 6:28pm
What the hell are we doing here?
This is a good view.
I told you, no struggling.
I can make things right with you.
You don't understand.
You can't ever make this right.
Attention... Torchwood employees!
Evening all!
- Now, stop what you're doing.
- Jack, are you OK?
Jack can't come to the comms right now.
But if you leave a message, I'll
be sure and pass it along.
What've you done to him?
No, no, wrong question.
You should be asking, what
am I about to do to you?
- Put Jack on right now!
- Eye Candy!
That was so masterful, so
bossy, so basically powerless.
Get up to the roofs of your
buildings. Quickly now, spit spot.
- Why?
- Owen!
Cos if you don't, '
you'll miss all the fun.
Hold on a minute, do I mean
fun or do I mean carnage?
I get them confused.
Are you running yet?
No dawdling now!
Gwen! Where's she going?
What're you doing?
I'm sorry. Now...Cardiff!
Isn't it pretty? Doesn't it twinkle so?
Take a good look.
Remember this... because
it all goes so quick.
Oh, my God...
Gwen?
Oh, God...
You've destroyed the city.
Jack, hold me.
Oh, my God What do we do, what do we do?
OK, keep everyone calm, tell them
to get every officer in. RUN!
What've you done?
It's OK. It's all gonna be OK.
Stop! Get off me!
Jack? Jack?Jack, can you hear me?
Are you there? Jack!
I'm detecting a huge rift
flare over at the castle.
It's been generated by the
rift manipulator at Torchwood.
Tosh, Ianto, Owen... are you OK?
Yeah, we're fine.
- Still here.
- Me too.
Good, OK, good.
Tosh, do we have the scale
of the damage on the city?
Fifteen major explosions, at
strategic points across the city.
There's currently a surge in
traffic trying to leave the city
but the explosions have cut
off all major routes in and out.
Landlines, mobile phones and IT
networks all down, TV and radio off air.
- He's completely crippled us.
- Shit.
Not wanting to be the harbinger
of doom but the systems
which serve the nuclear
plant have all gone off-line.
Tosh, Ianto, you have to stabilise the
nuclear power station, make that a priority.
Owen, what's it like at the hospital?
Lost all power.
The backup generators
gave out in the blast.
Every single machine in
this hospital is down.
It's a disaster.
OK, all of you, listen to me.
We're gonna put this city back together,
we're gonna find Jack and
we're gonna punish John.
Now, I need you to be careful. OK?
Where are you, Jack?
Where are you?
Cardiff 27AD
We're safe.
Now, before you do anything
rash, you have to hear...
Take us back now!
No way.
We have to be this far to
escape the trigger signal!
What?
Look at it! Go on.
It's bonded to my skin. I
can't get it off.Open it.
Ninth generation detonator.
You're a walking bomb!
Add to that a surveillance circuit, to
monitor my every word and action,
and he has me doing anything I'm told.
Cos if I don't... boom!
I'm not my own man.
I thought you'd see that.
No, you're so self-obsessed you thought
I'd want to blow up the stupid city!
When I could be experiencing 17
simultaneous pleasures in the Lotus Nebula!
just run.
Oh, please, that is the
oldest trick in the book.
Jack?
Gray?
I never stopped believing.
I always knew we'd
find each other again.
I'm sorry.
Sorry's not good enough.
Get a shovel.
{a6}Cardiff City Police HQ 7:39pm
This was a targeted attack, designed
to cause maximum panic.
Usual emergency procedures
won't cover what's happened here.
This is where we find out
how good we really are.
Cover the whole city, knock
on doors, check on people,
tell people that they are safe
and that it is being dealt with.
Get out there and do your jobs.
Bloody impressive, man.
She is that, yeah.
Lucky sod.
{a6}Central Server Building 8:01pm
Go!
It won't work!
Nothing, sorry.
We need to re-start
the Turnmill servers.
What if you can't?
- Then the reactor goes into meltdown.
- Then I'm going up there.
What? Ianto!
Look, if we can't fix the remote servers,
there must be something I can
do on-site to prevent a meltdown.
That could be suicide.
Are we gonna discuss
it, or are we gonna do it?
OK, but we both go.
I looked for you.
I searched for you for years.
You were my first thought, every day.
What are you expecting, mm?
A loving reunion? Absolution?
Me to say, "It's
OK, brother, "I forgive you."
Take Gray and keep him safe.
I got to go get your mother. RUN!
Those creatures, they lived to torture.
They kept us just on the verge of life.
I'd lie there, hemmed in by
corpses, praying to become one.
Because you...
let go... of my hand, remember?
If I could swap with you, I would.
Gray. Gray!
Where's Gray?
Where is he, son? Where is he?
Gray!
- Remember it again.
- Gray, where are you?
I believed you'd come, but you never did.
How long before you gave up, hm?
Months? Years?Decades?
What do you want from me?
I want you to suffer.
I want your life.
This is Cardiff.
27AD.
The city will be built
here, over the next 2, 000 years.
Your grave will be
the city's foundations.
Your blessing of life becomes a curse.
Each time you revive, with
a throatful of earth,
each time it chokes you afresh,
and you thrash on the edge
of death, you think of me.
All right, calling a halt
now I can't let you do this.
- Fill the grave.
- No way.
Then the detonator on
your arm gets activated.
What's that?
It's, er, sentimental value.
Torchwood Vaults 9:07pm
Skulking, is it?
Still no word from Jack.
Hey, it's gonna be fine.
What if it's not?
What if this is how it all ends?
I can't do this, Rhys. I'm not up to it.
Rubbish.
Those coppers are out
there now, because of you.
Even if you don't believe
in yourself, they did.
And I do.
You're a bloody hero, Gwen.
So you keep going, cos we need you.
Will you marry me again?
Gwen, I've got a rift
alert from inside the Hub,
mirroring the pattern from
earlier when Jack disappeared.
D'you think it could be him?
I can't check it out, I've got to
get the Turnmill servers back online.
Tosh, I can't leave the police station.
Yes, you can.
If they need you.
We'll be fine.
Are you sure?
I'll see you when it's all over.
Go!
You took your time.
On your knees!
Honestly, it's just
sex, sex, sex with you people!
Now!
Hands behind your head!
I'm gonna need a really good reason not
to shoot you within the next 20 seconds.
I know where Jack is.
You're lying.
He's buried alive, somewhere
beneath this city.
I came back to help you.
You bombed this city!
Listen to me!
You have to believe me.
It's Gray, Jack's brother, that's
been doing all this.
Don't talk rubbish.
He placed a bomb on me, molecularly
bonded the detonator to my skin,
I had to do what he wanted. Look!
He forced me to bury
Jack and then he freed me,
he told me I could go anywhere I wanted.
I could've run, but I
chose to come back here.
Why should I trust you?
They were separated as children.
Gray was abducted.
When I found him he was chained to the
ruins of a city on the Bedlam Outlands...
surrounded by corpses.
He was the only one left.
The creatures had long since gone.
Dunno how long he'd been there.
He thought I was the rescuing hero.
So, it took me too long to realise
he'd learned terrible things
watching those creatures.
He let me trust him...
The molecules are unbonding.
Just like he promised.
Oh, God.
See? Free man.Apparently.
I didn't have to come back here.
I could've run.
You find Jack, I'll let you live.
- But you'd better be quick.
- Fine.
Toshiko.
I need you to run a trace for an etheric particle
signal NME transmitting at 200 betacycles.
Gwen, where are you?
What's he doing? Where's Jack?
Trace that signal, we'll find him.
It's OK, Tosh.
I've got him covered.
Just do as he says.
No signals even vaguely resembling that.
There must be.
That transmitter's guaranteed for five
millennia through three permalayers -
it has to still be transmitting.
If not, we'll never find him.
He'll be buried... forever.
What the hell is that?
Oh, there's weevils loose
in the lower corridors.
Stay there, stay there.
Oh, my God, what's going
on, how did they get out?
It's Gray.
He must be here in the city, he
said he was gonna take Jack's life,
destroy it from the inside out.
A weevil wake-up call
could be just the beginning.
Owen, Gwen, can you hear me?
The streets are flooded with
weevils, they came out of nowhere.
There's no chance we'll get to
the nuclear power station in time.
Manual life support, get
them round the hospital.
Ianto, leave it to me.
- I can get there.
- How?
King of the Weevils, remember?
Push, will you! Have none
of you ever been in a scrum!
Bloody hell, how many were there?
It's like Fort Apache the Bronx.
Apart from the fact that there are
savage aliens and we could all die,
it's almost exactly the same, yeah.
Thanks for that
I am telling you I have
run every scan possible,
there is no signal traceable.
Then try it again, it's got to be there.
Oi, I'm talking to you.
You know you've got a real
pest problem around here.
Oh, God, I'm so pleased to see you!
Don't start, I'll make
things right, Eye Candy.
Then start by getting those Weevils
down the vaults before they recover.
It takes more than a
bullet to stop them.
- You did what?
- Ianto!
- I didn't have a choice!
- There's always a choice.
Can we just get these
Weevils into the cells!
If we don't find him, I'll kill you.
Very slowly.
What's happening? Tosh?
Tosh! Ianto, my comms are dead.
Gwen?
I let you go.
I gave you one trip, you
could have gone anywhere.
Question of honour.
Gray?
You're Gray, right?
There's no need for
this, we can help you.
Just tell us where Jack is.
His life's mine now.
Where's Jack?
What've you done with him?
WHAT'VE YOU DONE WITH HIM?
Turnmill Nuclear Power Station 9:42pm
Get the hell out of here!
What the hell are you
doing here, more like!
The systems going into meltdown.
A soldier never leaves her post.
Well you can now, OK?
I'm with Torchwood and
we're dealing with this.
What d'you know about
nuclear containment structure?
Well, I'm presuming if
you've run out of power,
then the containment
structure's over pressurised.
The containment spray and cooling systems
aren't working so the fuel can't be cooled down,
it's overheating.
So there'll be a meltdown and radioactive material
will be released into the atmosphere. Yeah?
- Roughly?
- Roughly.
And I'm at the eye of the storm.
We found you in a 20-foot grave!
Freeze me, set the alarm to
defrost in 107 years time.
I begrudge you everything.
Recall signal.
Get me out of here, Tosh!
Get me out of here!
I've died once, I'm not doing it again!
Where's Jack?
Where's Gwen, Ianto, John?
You want to watch the
dead man die again?
Owen, just stay calm.
Why should I do that?
Where's the fun in that?
I'm gonna rage my way to oblivion.
- Please stop.
- Why?
Give me one good bloody reason why -
one good reason why I
shouldn't keep screaming.
Because you're breaking my heart.
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
No, no, no, it isn't. No, it isn't.
Don't you dare go there, Tosh.
I'm really sorry.
What's gonna happen to me, Tosh?
I can't.
Please. OK, I need to know.
The containment chamber will be
flooded with the irradiated coolant.
Ah, my body will slowly
decompose, as I watch.
I should've been able to stop it.
Oh, come on, Tosh.
There's no way you could've
anticipated that power spike, come on.
Besides, you've saved my back
so many times in the past.
Right from the moment I joined.
Your second week I had to cover for you,
pretend I was a medic, cos you
were hung over and unreachable.
What was it, Space Pig?
- Space Pig.
- Yeah.
We never did get that
date, did we, you and me?
We sort of, er, missed each other.
It was my fault. I didn't...
notice until it was too late.
I'm sorry.
Me too.
COOLANT VENTING IN PROGRESS
It's starting.
Owen...
It's all right.
Really, Tosh.
It's all right.
'Oh, God.
Owen...
Owen...
Toshiko? Toshiko?
Gwen, I need help down here!
The nuclear plant at
Turnmill. Owen's there.
Sealed in.
Re-routed the blast.
I couldn't save him.
Tosh? There you go, darling.
Talk to me now, come on. Tosh!
And Cardiff city centre is today recovering
from a series of devastating explosions.
City leaders say it's too early to
account for the full scale of the damage
that also saw sightings of vicious
animals on the streets of the city.
My whole life I was looking for him.
Now I have to lose him all over again.
You cryo-freeze him and then what?
Wake him up in a 100 years
and he's miraculously better?
Cos that's not gonna happen.
Maybe killing him would
be the release he needs.
There has been enough death.
You didn't struggle...
when I buried you.
Like... you were allowing it.
It was my penance.
It's not your fault.
Need help with those rift predictions?
Lot of this planet I haven't seen.
You like it so much, thought
I might take a look.
Maybe see you around.
I'm sorry for your losses.
Final logout procedure DR OWEN HAPPER
Final logout procedure TOSHIKO SATO
OK. So...
if you're seeing this, I guess
it means, I'm... well, dead.
Hope it was impressive!
Not crossing the road or
an incident with a toaster.
I just wanted to say...
it's OK.
It really is.
Jack, you saved me.
You showed me all the
wonders of the universe and...
all those possibilities.
And I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.
Thank you.
And Owen, you never knew.
I love you. All of you.
And...
I hope I did good.
Now we carry on.
I don't think I can, not after this.
You can.
We all can.
The end is where we start from.

C'est au 21Ťme siŤcle que tout change,
et Torchwood est prÍt.
Des explosifs...
Bam !
Jack, qui a fait Áa ?
Capitaine John Hart.
Jack, qu'est-ce qu'il veut ?
Dis bonjour ŗ la famille.
Non, c'est impossible.
Ca fait un moment que tu
n'as pas vu ton frŤre, hein ?
Gray ?
Ce b‚tard de John a pris le SUV.
Il l'a ramenť ŗ Torchwood.
J'ai des signaux d'activitť de

Activitť majeure ŗ l'hŰpital

John ou je ne sais quoi.
Rhys, dťpose Owen ŗ l'hŰpital.

Gwen, tu prends le commissariat.
Et tu me dťposeras ŗ Torchwood.
- On va tous tenir ?
- Pas le choix.
Ce sont des piŤges.
Alors soyez prudents.
Vous savez ce dont il est capable.

Andy !
Ils sont sortis de nulle part,
dans tout le b‚timent.
Ils n'ťtaient pas humains, en tout cas
je ne connais aucun humain comme eux.
Tout le commissariat est sous le choc.
Les 4 officiers les plus ‚gťs, tuťs.
Tout le monde court partout
comme des poulets sans tÍte.
Rhys, qu'est-ce que tu fais lŗ ?
C'est une scŤne de crime confidentielle.
Si la nouvelle sort d'ici, un vent
de panique s'abattra sur la ville.
Rhys ne dira rien.
Je garde plus de secrets
que tu le penses.
Comme quoi ?
Une Agence du Temps, basťe ŗ Cardiff.
Elle n'est pas basťe ŗ Cardiff.
Super secret. Je demande,
tu me dis tout. Bravo.
Bon sang, qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Des Weevils. Ils vivent dans les ťgouts.
Tu plaisantes.
- Je peux les endormir ?
- Fais-toi plaisir.
Ils ont tuť les 4
officiers les plus ‚gťs ?
On dirait une attaque ciblťe.
Tosh, ta position.
J'entre dans le serveur central.
Aucun signe d'activitť pour l'instant.
Ce b‚timent hťberge les serveurs
pour l'armťe, la police, la sťcu.
Il surveille mÍme le serveur de

Quel problŤme ont-ils signalť ?
Des fantŰmes, ici.
Comment va ton bras ?
Owen m'a donnť des analgťsiques
surpuissants, Áa a l'air de marcher.
Ianto.
Dťmons ! Blasphťmateurs !
Priez votre Dieu paÔen.
Tandis qu'au nom du Seigneur,

- Et voilŗ.

Elles sont trŤs bonnes.
J'en ai des tas comme Áa.
C'est Áa, mon garÁon, viens lŗ.
Allez, c'est Áa, essaye Áa.
T'es vraiment stupide.
Je t'ai retirť toutes tes armes,
si jamais tu te poses la question.
C'est un peu extrÍme, tu ne crois pas ?
Quoi ? Tu n'aimes plus Ítre attachť ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fais lŗ ?
Ah, tu vois...
Maintenant tu t'intťresses ŗ moi.
C'est toujours pareil, les gens s'en
fichent jusqu'ŗ ce qu'on les attache.
Pour plusieurs raisons, en rťalitť.
Tout d'abord, tu as ťtť
trŤs malpoli envers moi.
- Quoi ?
- TrŤs malpoli.
Devant des gens qui
me connaissent ŗ peine.
Tu m'as rabaissť.
Je ne peux pas laisser passer Áa.
Sťrieusement ?
Ensuite, tu as tout le temps.
L'ťternitť.
Et tu refuses encore de
passer du temps avec moi.
AprŤs tout ce qu'on a vťcu, aprŤs
tout ce que j'ai fait pour toi.
Oý est Gray ?
Qu'as-tu fait de mon frŤre ?
Tu ne rťalises pas.
Actions, rťpercussions, ricochets.
Je ne contrŰle rien.
Tu ne contrŰles rien ? Je t'en prie !
Ca l'est.
Tu dois comprendre Áa.
On localise les
activitťs de la brŤche...
Quelques petits chocs.
Ne touche pas ŗ Áa !
Je travaille, lŗ !
Si tu veux ťviter Áa, ferme-la !
Bien, je crois qu'il est temps
de trouver un point d'observation.
Quoi que tu prťpares, on t'arrÍtera.
OK.
Vas-y ! ArrÍte-moi !
J'espŤre que tu le peux, vraiment.
Non ?
TrŤs bien, allons-nous
trouver une belle vue.
Qu'est-ce qu'on fout lŗ ?
C'est une belle vue.
Je te l'ai dit, arrÍte de te dťbattre.
Je peux arranger les choses avec toi.
Tu ne comprends pas.
Tu ne pourras jamais arranger Áa.
Votre attention, employťs de Torchwood !
Bonsoir ŗ tous !
- Cessez toute activitť.
- Jack, que se passe-t-il ?
Jack ne peut pas venir parler.
Mais vous pouvez laisser un message,
je lui transmettrai sans faute.
Qu'est-ce que tu lui as fait ?
Non, mauvaise question.
Tu devrais te demander ce
que je m'apprÍte ŗ vous faire.
- Passe-moi Jack tout de suite !
- Mon mignon !
C'ťtait tellement impťrieux,
autoritaire, et totalement inutile.
Montez sur les toits de vos b‚timents.
Vite. Hop hop hop.
- Pourquoi ?
- Owen !
Parce que sinon, vous
allez louper la fÍte.
Attendez, je voulais
dire fÍte ou carnage ?
Je les confonds toujours.
Vous courez ?
C'est pas le moment de traÓner.
Gwen ! Oý va-t-elle ?
Que fais-tu ?
Je suis dťsolť... Cardiff !
N'est-ce pas magnifique ?
Elle scintille mÍme.
Regardez bien.
Rappelez-vous-en...
Car Áa part tellement vite.
Oh mon Dieu...
Gwen ?
Oh mon Dieu...
Tu as dťtruit la ville !
Jack, serre-moi.
Oh mon Dieu, qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
Calme tout le monde, dis-leur
d'appeler tous les officiers. Vite !
Qu'as-tu fait ?
C'est bon. Ca va aller.
ArrÍte ! L‚che-moi !
Jack ? Tu m'entends ?
Tu es lŗ, Jack ?
Je dťtecte une forte activitť
de la brŤche en haut du ch‚teau.
Elle a ťtť gťnťrťe par le
manipulateur de la brŤche ŗ Torchwood.
Tosh, Ianto, Owen... Tout va bien ?
Oui, Áa va.
- Toujours lŗ.
- Moi aussi.
Bien, OK.
Tosh, tu connais l'ťchelle
des dťg‚ts sur la ville ?
15 explosions majeures,
ŗ des endroits stratťgiques.
Tout le monde essaye de
quitter la ville par la route.
Mais les explosions ont bloquť
tous les itinťraires majeurs.
Lignes fixes, portables,
internet, TV et radio hors service.
- Il nous a totalement handicapťs.
- Merde.
Sans vouloir faire le messager
de la mort, tous les systŤmes
qui contrŰlaient la centrale
nuclťaire ont sautť.
Tosh, Ianto, stabilisez la centrale
nuclťaire, c'est votre prioritť.
Owen, la situation ŗ l'hŰpital ?
On n'a plus de courant.
Le gťnťrateur d'urgence a
l‚chť durant l'explosion.
Toutes les machines de
cet hŰpital sont mortes.
C'est un dťsastre.
OK, ťcoutez-moi tous.
On va arranger Áa, remettre
cette ville en ordre,
trouver Jack et punir John.
Soyez prudents, d'accord ?
Oý es-tu, Jack ?
Oý es-tu ?
On est ŗ l'abri.
Avant que tu ne t'ťnerves,
tu dois m'ťcouter...
RamŤne-nous, maintenant !
Hors de question.
On doit Ítre assez loin
pour ťchapper au dťtonateur.
Quoi ?
Regarde ! Allez.
Il est attachť ŗ ma peau, je
ne peux pas l'enlever. Ouvre.
Dťtonateur de la 9Ťme gťnťration.
Tu es une bombe humaine !
Avec en plus un circuit de surveillance
de tous mes gestes et paroles,
et il me fait faire tout ce qu'il veut.
Sinon... Boum !
Je ne suis pas moi-mÍme !
Je pensais que tu le verrais.
Mais non, t'es bien trop narcissique.
Tu croyais que faire exploser
cette ville m'intťresserait.
Alors que je pourrais goŻter 17 plaisirs
simultanťs dans la Nťbuleuse Lotus !
Cours.
Je t'en prie, cette feinte est honteuse.
Jack ?
Gray ?
Je n'ai jamais cessť d'y croire.
J'ai toujours su qu'on se retrouverait.
Je suis dťsolť.
Ca n'est pas suffisant.
Prends une pelle.
C'ťtait une attaque ciblťe,
pour causer le plus de panique possible.
Les protocoles d'urgence
habituels ne suffiront pas ici.
C'est le moment de dťcouvrir
ce que l'on vaut vraiment.
Couvrez toute la ville, sonnez
chez les gens, prenez soin d'eux.
Dites-leur qu'il n'y a plus de
danger, et que l'on s'occupe de tout.
Sortez d'ici, et faites votre boulot.
Vraiment impressionnante.
C'est vrai.
T'as de la chance.
Allez !
Ca ne marche pas !
Toujours rien, dťsolť.
On doit remettre en marche
les serveurs de Turnmill.
Et si on níy arrive pas ?
- Le rťacteur fusionnera.
- Alors je vais lŗ-bas.
Quoi ? Ianto !
Si on ne peut pas rťparer les commandes,
je dois bien pouvoir faire quelque
chose manuellement pour ťviter la fusion
Ca serait du suicide.
On va dťbattre, ou agir ?
D'accord, mais on y va tous les deux.
Je t'ai cherchť.
Je t'ai cherchť des annťes.
Tu ťtais ma premiŤre pensťe,
chaque jour.
Tu t'attendais ŗ quoi ?
Une rťunion chaleureuse ?
L'absolution ?
Que je dise, "C'est bon,
mon frŤre, je te pardonne."
<i>Prends Gray, et veille sur lui.</i>
<i>Je dois aller trouver ta mŤre. Cours !</i>
Ces crťatures vivaient pour la torture.
Elles nous gardaient
juste au bord de la vie.
Je restais ťtendu lŗ, entourť de
cadavres, priant pour en devenir un.
Car tu as...
l‚chť...ma main, tu te souviens ?
Si je pouvais ťchanger
nos places, je le ferais.
<i>Gray ! Gray !</i>
<i>Oý est Gray ?</i>
<i>Oý est-il, fils ? Oý est-il ?</i>
<i>Gray !</i>
- Repenses-y encore.
- Gray, oý es-tu ?
Je pensais que tu viendrais.
Mais Áa n'est jamais arrivť.
Au bout de combien de
temps as-tu abandonnť ?
Des mois ? Des annťes ? Des dťcades ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux de moi ?
Je veux que tu souffres.
Je veux ta vie.
Nous sommes ŗ Cardiff.
En 27 av. J.C.
La ville sera construite ici
durant les 2000 prochaines annťes.
Ta tombe sera ses fondations.
Ta bťnťdiction de vie
devient une malťdiction.
Tu ressuscites ŗ chaque fois,
la gorge pleine de terre,
tu t'ťtouffes de nouveau ŗ chaque fois,
et tu te dťbats, au bord de
la mort, en pensant ŗ moi.
TrŤs bien, on fait une pause,
je peux pas te laisser faire Áa.
- Remplis la tombe !
- Hors de question.
Dans ce cas, le dťtonateur
sur ton bras sera activť.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Valeur sentimentale.
On s'isole ?
Toujours aucune nouvelle de Jack.
Ca va aller.
Et si Áa n'allait pas ?
Et si c'ťtait la fin ?
Je ne peux pas faire Áa, Rhys.
Je ne suis pas prÍte.
N'importe quoi.
Ces flics sont dehors gr‚ce ŗ toi.
MÍme si tu ne crois pas en toi,
eux croient en toi.
Et moi aussi.
Tu es un vrai hťros, Gwen.
Alors accroche-toi,
car on a besoin de toi.
Veux-tu m'ťpouser ŗ nouveau ?
Gwen, il y a eu une
alerte d'activitť au QG
qui fait ťcho ŗ celle de tout
ŗ l'heure quand Jack a disparu.
Ca pourrait Ítre lui ?
Je peux pas vťrifier, je dois
m'occuper des serveurs de Turnmill.
Tosh, je ne peux pas
quitter le commissariat.
Si, tu peux.
S'ils ont besoin de toi...
Ca ira.
SŻr ?
On se verra quand tout Áa sera fini.
Vas-y !
Tu as mis le temps.
A genoux !
HonnÍtement, vous ne pensez
vraiment tous qu'au sexe !
Tout de suite !
Les mains derriŤre la tÍte !
Il va me falloir une trŤs bonne raison
pour ne pas te tirer dessus
dans les 20 secondes qui suivent.
Je sais oý est Jack.
Tu mens.
Il est enterrť vivant,
quelque part sous la ville.
Je suis revenu vous aider.
Tu as fait exploser la ville !
Ecoute-moi !
Tu dois me croire.
C'est Gray, le frŤre de Jack,
qui est derriŤre tout Áa.
Ne m'embrouille pas.
Il a placť une bombe sur moi,
liťe molťculairement ŗ ma peau.
Je devais faire ce qu'il voulait.
Regarde !
Il m'a forcť ŗ enterrer
Jack puis m'a libťrť.
Il m'a dit d'aller lŗ oý je voulais.
J'aurais pu m'enfuir,
mais j'ai choisi de revenir.
Pourquoi devrais-je te croire ?
Ils ont ťtť sťparťs dans leur enfance.
Gray a ťtť enlevť.
Je l'ai trouvť enchaÓnť aux ruines
d'une ville sur les Terres de Bedlam.
Entourť de cadavres.
Il ťtait le dernier.
Les crťatures ťtaient
parties depuis longtemps.
Je ne sais combien de
temps il est restť lŗ.
Il m'a pris pour son sauveur.
J'ai rťalisť trop tard
qu'il avait appris d'horribles
choses au contact de ces crťatures.
Il m'a poussť ŗ lui faire confiance...
Les molťcules se dťlient.
Comme promis.
Oh mon Dieu.
Tu vois ? Un homme libre.
Apparemment.
Rien ne m'obligeait ŗ revenir.
J'aurais pu m'enfuir.
Si tu trouves Jack, je t'ťpargnerai.
- Mais t'as intťrÍt ŗ te dťpÍcher.
- Bien.
Toshiko.
<i>Cherche le signal d'une
particule ethťrique NME</i>
<i>transmettant ŗ 200 bťtacycles.</i>
Gwen, oý es-tu ?
Que fait-il ? Oý est Jack ?
Trouve-moi ce signal, et on le saura.
C'est bon, Tosh.
Je m'occupe de lui.
Fais ce qu'il te dit.
Aucun signal n'y ressemblant,
de prŤs ou de loin.
Il doit exister.
Ce transmetteur ťtait garanti
5 millťnaires,
gr‚ce ŗ 3 permacouches ťcologiques,
il doit encore transmettre.
<i>Sinon, on ne le trouvera jamais.</i>
<i>Il restera enterrť... Pour toujours.</i>
Qu'est-ce que c'est que Áa ?
Des Weevils en libertť au sous-sol.
Reste-lŗ.
Oh mon Dieu, que se passe-t-il ?
Comment sont-ils sortis ?
C'est Gray.
Il doit Ítre en ville, il disait
vouloir prendre la vie de Jack,
et la dťtruire totalement.
Rťveiller les Weevils n'est
peut-Ítre que le dťbut.
Owen, Gwen, vous m'entendez ?
Les rues sont remplies de Weevils,
ils sont sortis de nulle part.
On arrivera jamais ŗ la
centrale nuclťaire ŗ temps.
Ventilation manuelle, il
en faut dans tout l'hŰpital.
Ianto, je m'en occupe.
- Je peux y aller.
- Comment ?
Je suis le Roi des Weevils,
tu te souviens ?
Poussez !
Vous n'avez jamais ťtť dans une mÍlťe ?
Bon sang, combien y en avait-il ?
On dirait "Le Policeman".
A part qu'il y a des extraterrestres
sauvages qui pourraient tous nous tuer,
c'est presque pareil, oui.
Merci.
J'ai fait tous les scanners possibles,
il n'y a aucun signal.
Essaye encore, il doit Ítre lŗ !
Eh, je te parle !
Vous avez un sťrieux
problŤme d'hygiŤne, ici.
Oh, je suis vraiment
contente de te voir.
Commence pas, je vais arranger
les choses, mon mignon.
Commence par emmener ces Weevils dans
les voŻtes avant qu'ils ne rťcupŤrent.
Il faut plus qu'une
balle pour les arrÍter.
- Tu as fait quoi ?
- Ianto !
- Je n'avais pas le choix !
- On a toujours le choix.
On pourrait juste
s'occuper des Weevils ?
Si on ne le retrouve pas, je te tue.
TrŤs lentement.
Que se passe-t-il ? Tosh ?
Tosh ! Ianto, les
communications sont coupťes.
Gwen ?
Je t'ai laissť partir.
Je t'ai donnť un aller, tu
aurais pu aller n'importe oý.
C'est une question d'honneur.
Gray ?
Tu es bien Gray ?
Pas besoin de tout Áa, on peut t'aider.
Dis-nous juste oý est Jack.
Sa vie m'appartient, maintenant.
Oý est Jack ?
Qu'as-tu fait de lui ?
Qu'as-tu fait de lui ?
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Sortez tout de suite !
Qu'est-ce que vous faites lŗ, plutŰt !
Le systŤme va fusionner
Un soldat ne quitte jamais son poste.
Eh bien vous pouvez maintenant. OK ?
Je suis de Torchwood,
et on s'occupe de Áa.
Ah, et que savez-vous de la
structure d'isolement nuclťaire ?
Eh bien, j'imagine que
si l'on a plus de courant,
la structure d'isolement
est surpressurisťe.
Le spray d'isolement et le systŤme de
refroidissement ne fonctionnent pas,
le combustible n'est plus
refroidi et surchauffe.
Il y aura donc tŰt ou tard une fusion
et la substance radioactive sera
rel‚chťe dans l'atmosphŤre. C'est Áa ?
- En gros ?
- En gros.
Bien, vous devez partir.
Soyez prudente, il y a des
crťatures en libertť dehors.
Prenez Áa, c'est un gaz incapacitant.
Ca a l'air plus dangereux dehors qu'ici.
Je crois que Áa se vaut.
Allez-y.
Merci.
Tosh, il va falloir que tu m'aides.
Je n'ai aucune idťe de ce que je fais.
Bon, ne panique pas, mais le rťacteur
a dťjŗ atteint le niveau critique.
Tu veux dire qu'il va fusionner, c'est Áa ?
Et je suis dans l'oeil de la tempÍte.
Oui, dťsolťe.
Bien, tu peux arrÍter Áa ?
- Bien sŻr, je suis gťniale !
- Oui.
Je vais essayer de dťtourner le courant
de la source auxiliaire vers Turnmill.
Si Áa marche, je t'expliquerai comment
restaurer le systŤme de refroidissement.
Bien, maintenant...
Tosh !
Aidez-moi...
Pitiť.
Tosh ? Tu m'entends ?
Certaines personnes pensent
que la mort est un g‚chis.
Je pense que c'est plus un soulagement.
Tosh ! Tu m'entends ?
C'est comment ? Que ressens-tu ?
As-tu peur ? Es-tu triste ?
Tu peux me le dire. C'est fini.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Tosh, rťponds-moi.
J'ai besoin de toi, ma belle !
- C'est quoi ce bruit ?
- Quelque chose ne va pas.
Vous occupez pas de Áa, j'ai une idťe.
Je te pardonne.
Comment as-tu survťcu ?
Tu l'as dťcouvert il y a longtemps ?
3 jours.
Juste un signal, parfaitement rťgulier.
Mais je ne t'ai pas dit le meilleur,
je peux trouver sa localisation.
Oý Áa ?
C'est ici.
A 6 mŤtres sous terre, mais
c'est bien lŗ ! Creuse !
Pourrait-on arrÍter l'interrogatoire ?
On t'a trouvť
enterrť ŗ 6 mŤtres sous terre !
- On doit accepter Áa sans question ?
- Oui.
Tu es censť Ítre en train
de bosser pour nous !
Qui t'a donnť cette bague ?
J'ai voyagť sur ma
propre ligne temporelle.
Je ne dois pas rencontrer l'autre moi,
beaucoup de vies en dťpendent.
Vous protťgerez le futur.
C'est bien votre but, non ?
Maintenant, vous devez
me mettre ŗ la morgue.
Congelez-moi, et programmez la
dťcongťlation pour dans 107 ans.
Je te pardonne, Gray.
Ne t'ťloigne pas de moi.
Ne t'ťloigne pas de moi !
ArrÍte-toi. ArrÍte-toi !
Je t'ai pardonnť, je t'ai donnť
l'absolution, fais-en de mÍme !
Je priais pour mourir !
Ces crťatures, ce qu'elles
nous ont fait, ŗ cause de toi...
Le fils prodigue, celui qui a
survťcu, et qui survivra toujours.
Ma seule force est ma haine pour toi.
Je ne savais pas.
Je n'ai rťalisť que trop tard.
Je te reproche tout.
Je veux tout t'arracher, te
laisser seul ŗ crier dans le noir.
Je ne te pardonnerai jamais.
Tout est de ta faute.
Je sais.
Je sais, Gray.
Ca y est.
- Dťsolť.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Un signal de rappel.
Il est temps qu'ils
retournent tous chez eux.
Que s'est-il passť ?
Oý sont-ils passťs ?
A Abergavenny ?
Allez, Tosh.
C'est parti !
Tu as rťussi, on a du courant !
Ca va ?
Oui, Áa va.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Juste un... problŤme mťcanique.
Tu es blessťe ?
Qui, moi ? Non !
- Ca va, c'est juste mon bras.
- OK.
- Je vais prendre un autre analgťsique.
- Bien.
OK.
Allez, on va faire Áa ensemble.
Owen...
Quoi ?
On ne peut pas arrÍter la fusion.
C'est dťjŗ trop avancť.
OK, c'est pas une bonne nouvelle, hein ?
Allez Tosh, il doit bien y avoir
une solution, il y en a toujours.
Ta seule option est de dťcharger
les tuyaux par l'intťrieur.
Les dťcharger oý ?
- Tu es dans le b‚timent d'isolement.
- Oui ?
Tu dois programmer un
dťclenchement ŗ retardement
rassembler le combustible dans ce
bunker et dťclencher une quarantaine.
Ferme le b‚timent et la fusion
sera contenue ŗ l'intťrieur.
<i>Et ťvidemment, pense ŗ sortir.</i>
Oui, je dois pouvoir m'en rappeler.
Je vais ouvrir le protocole, tu dois
juste entrer le temps et autoriser.
D'accord, Tosh. Faisons donc.
Et Tosh ? Merci.
Je suis lŗ pour Áa.
Jack !
Dieu merci !
On croyait t'avoir perdu.
Jamais. Jamais.
Il y a foule pour les c‚lins.
Ca a toujours ťtť le cas,
et Áa le sera toujours.
Joli, le coup de la bague. Merci.
Je te devais au moins Áa.
- Ecoute, Gray est ici.
- Je sais.
C'est terminť.
Yes ! Rock'n'roll !
Owen, sors de lŗ !
Il y a un pic d'ťnergie
dans le systŤme !
Quand il sera au maximum, la
quarantaine se dťclenchera !
Non ! Tosh ! Toshiko !
Je ne peux pas sortir !
Pas comme Áa !
Je ne meurs pas encore !
Sors-moi de lŗ, Tosh !
Sors-moi de lŗ !
Je suis dťjŗ mort une fois,
je ne recommence pas !
Oý est Jack ?
Oý sont Gwen, Ianto, John ?
Vous voulez voir le
mort mourir ŗ nouveau.
Owen, calme-toi.
Pourquoi ?
C'est pas drŰle !
J'avancerai vers l'oubli
en criant ma rage.
- ArrÍte, je t'en prie.
- Pourquoi ?
Donne-moi une seule putain de raison !
Une seule raison pour
que j'arrÍte de crier !
Car tu me brises le coeur.
Je suis dťsolť.
C'est ma faute.
Non, c'est pas vrai.
T'as pas intťrÍt ŗ penser Áa.
Je suis vraiment dťsolť.
Que va-t-il m'arriver, Tosh ?
Je ne peux pas...
S'il te plaÓt. J'ai besoin de savoir.
La chambre d'isolement va se remplir
du liquide de refroidissement irradiť.
Mon corps va se dťcomposer
lentement, sous mon regard.
J'aurais dŻ rťussir ŗ arrÍter Áa.
ArrÍte, Tosh.
Tu n'aurais jamais pu
anticiper ce pic d'ťnergie.
Et tu m'as dťjŗ sauvť la vie
je ne sais combien de fois.
Depuis le jour oý je suis arrivť.
DŤs ta deuxiŤme semaine,
j'ai dŻ te remplacer.
Prťtendre que j'ťtais mťdecin...
Car tu avais la gueule de bois.
C'ťtait quoi dťjŗ,
un cochon de l'espace ?
- Un cochon de l'espace.
- Oui.
On n'a jamais eu ce rendez-vous,
finalement, toi et moi.
On s'est en quelque sorte loupťs.
C'ťtait ma faute. Je n'ai pas...
Je ne l'ai remarquť que trop tard.
Je suis dťsolť.
Moi aussi.
<i>Libťration du liquide de
refroidissement en cours.</i>
Ca commence.
Owen...
C'est bon.
Vraiment, Tosh.
C'est bon.
Oh mon Dieu...
Owen...
Toshiko ?
Gwen, viens m'aider !
La centrale nuclťaire de Turnmill.
Owen est lŗ-bas.
Il est enfermť.
Il dťviait l'explosion.
Je n'ai pas pu le sauver.
Tosh, voilŗ ma chťrie.
Parle-moi, Tosh.
Et le centre de Cardiff se remet
d'une sťrie d'explosions dťvastatrices.
Les dirigeants de la ville disent qu'il
est trop tŰt pour ťvaluer les dťg‚ts.
Mais des animaux fťroces ont ťtť
vus partout dans les rues.
Je l'ai cherchť toute ma vie.
Je dois le perdre ŗ nouveau.
Tu le cryogťnises, et ensuite ?
Tu le rťveilles dans 100 ans et
il ira miraculeusement mieux ?
Ca n'arrivera pas.
La mort serait peut-Ítre la
dťlivrance qu'il lui faut.
Il y a eu assez de morts.
Tu ne t'es pas dťbattu...
Quand je t'ai enterrť.
Comme si tu l'autorisais.
C'ťtait ma pťnitence.
Ce n'est pas ta faute.
Tu as besoin d'aide pour
tes prťdictions de la brŤche ?
J'ai encore beaucoup ŗ
voir de cette planŤte.
Tu l'aimes tellement,
je vais y jeter un coup d'oeil.
On se recroisera peut-Ítre.
Je suis dťsolť, pour tes pertes.
Procťdure de dťconnexion finale,
DR OWEN HARPER.
Procťdure de dťconnexion finale,
TOSHIKO SATO.
Bien...
Si vous voyez Áa, je suppose
que je suis... eh bien, morte.
J'espŤre que c'ťtait impressionnant.
Pas en traversant la rue
ou ŗ cause d'un grille-pain.
Je voulais juste vous dire...
C'est bon.
Vraiment.
Jack, tu m'as sauvťe.
Tu m'as montrť toutes les
merveilles de cet univers et...
Toutes ses possibilitťs.
Je n'aurais manquť
Áa pour rien au monde.
Merci.
Et Owen... Tu n'as jamais su...
Je t'aime. Je vous aime tous.
Et...
J'espŤre avoir ťtť bonne.
Maintenant, on continue.
Je ne pense pas pouvoir, pas aprŤs Áa.
Tu peux.
On le peut tous.
C'est de la fin que l'on commence.

Tout est sous contrôle.
Les techniciens sont sur place, à vous.
- T'es un chou.
- C'est à moi. Fallait commander.
Je viens d'arriver.
Dommage pour toi.
Je fais quoi, maintenant ?
- Qui c'est ?
- Je sais pas. Un gars.
- Tu viens au Slimbo, vendredi ?
- C'est quoi, un pot ?
Soirée pizz', je crois.
J'irai peut-être.
Va falloir remballer, les gars.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Me demandez pas.
Il faut évacuer.
Ici SOCO, on se retire.
À vous.
On y va !
Tout le monde recule, merci.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Excusez-moi.
Que se passe-t-il ?
J'en sais fichtre rien.
Ordre d'en haut.
Mais le corps est toujours là, non ?
- On peut pas l'y laisser.
- Ils veulent avoir le champ libre.
Autorisation spéciale.
Pour qui ?
Torchwood.
- C'est quoi, Torchwood ?
- Section spéciale, je pense.
- Il est chaud ?
- Oui, prenez-le.
C'est pas la procédure.
Ils vont contaminer toute la scène.
- Et on les laisse...
- Entre nous...
Il n'y a plus de procédure.
Ça devient n'importe quoi.
C'est bien ça.
Je peux le goûter.
Œstrogène.
Reconnaissable entre mille.
Prenez la pillule.
Tirez la chasse.
Il entre dans le système aqueux,

Il fait son chemin jusqu'au ciel,

Une pluie contraceptive.
J'adore cette planète.
Au moins, ça m'évitera d'être enceint.
Plus jamais ça.
Comment ça se passe ?
Rien, pour l'instant.
Je dois le sentir, pour l'activer.
Dépêche-toi de sentir.
Je me caille ici.
Il n'y a pas d'interrupteur.
C'est une question d'accès.
Il doit me l'accorder.
Si tu le dis.
C'est comme...
En place !
Je le latte s'il me colle un pain.
Concentre-toi, tu veux ?
Susie.
Il y a un...
Qu'est-ce que...?
Bon Dieu, qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
Écoutez-moi. Nous n'avons que 2 min.
alors écoutez-moi bien, d'accord ?
- Qui êtes-vous ?
- Faites-moi confiance.
Vous êtes décédé.
- Comment ça, décédé ?
- Poignardé.
Je suis pas mort,
puisque je vous vois.
On vous a ramené, mais ce sera bref.
C'est pourquoi il faut vous concentrer.
- Qui vous a fait ça ? Qu'avez-vous vu ?
- Pourquoi je suis mort ?
- Qui vous a attaqué ?
- Je veux pas être mort !
60 secondes.
Réfléchissez. Regardez-moi.
Qu'avez-vous vu en dernier ?
J'ai rien vu du tout...
Je sais plus.
Qui vous a tué ?
Les avez-vous vus ?
J'en sais rien !
On m'a attaqué par derrière.
Plaie dorsale, arme blanche,
d'après la police.
Vous ne pouviez rien voir.
Que va-t-il m'arriver ?
- 30 secondes.
- Mais il n'a rien vu !
- Ne les gaspille pas !
- Qu'est-ce que je peux ajouter ?
Comment vous appelez-vous ?
- John. John Tucker.
- Bien, John.
- Ce ne sera plus long.
- Qui êtes vous ?
Capitaine Jack Harkness.
Décrivez-moi l'expérience de la mort.
Qu'avez-vous vu ?
Racontez-moi
ce que vous avez vu.
10 secondes.
Le néant.
Rien que le néant.
Oh, mon Dieu !
Il n'y a donc rien !
Merde !
Je l'avais dit. C'est idiot
de lui dire qu'il était mort.
- Fais-le, toi !
- Trop tard, il est pour les asticots.
On a dit au précédent
qu'il était blessé.
Il a passé ses 2 minutes
à réclamer une ambulance.
Peut-être n'y a-t-il pas
de manière idéale.
Qu'en pensez-vous ?
Encore debout ?
Je suis là.
Ils ont parlé aux infos
d'un meurtre dans le centre.
Tu étais là-bas ?
Ah non. Je savais pas.
J'étais sur autre chose.
Pourquoi tu n'es pas couché ?
Bernard Abbot est passé.
Il m'a parlé de ses plans.
Il se tire encore cet été.
Et ça t'a pas énervé ?
J'ai bu un thé.
Il a lu ce truc sur le diabète.
Lui et moi, prenant le thé.
Je me fais vieux.
Il y a du chinois dans le frigo.
J'ai pas faim.
- Tu viens te coucher ?
- Bientôt. Je finis ça.
Ce type s'est découvert une sœur.
À tout de suite.
Yvonne, je peux te demander
un service ? Une recherche.
Fais la queue.
Un Capt. Jack Harkness.
Tu me fais ça ?
Je suis occupée. Gros dossiers.
Il est dans dans quelle arme ?
Je sais seulement
qu'il est capitaine.
- Si j'ai le temps.
- Merci !
Sarah Pallister, 72 ans.
Tuée dans son living.
Rani Ghosh, 45 ans.
Tuée sur Robin Tree Alley.
Et maintenant, John Tucker, 19 ans.
Tué sur Shankvela Lane.
Pour l'instant, rien ne relie
ces 3 meurtres.
Si ce n'est la cause de la mort.
Infligée, pour ce que l'on sait,
avec la même arme.
Une lame de 20 cm de long,
8 de large.
Les 2 femmes ont été
poignardées de face.
Mais Tucker a été attaqué dans le dos.
Ça nous apprend quoi,
sur le meurtrier ?
Que c'est un lâche.
Ces gens, hier soir.
Dans la voiture.
Qui sont-ils ?
Qu'est-ce que Torchwood ?
Je sais pas.
Unité spéciale ?
Oui, mais pourquoi ?
Je te parie 10 billets que
c'est des experts en ADN.
Ils ne jurent plus que par ça.
Comme à la télé. Belles conneries.
"Les Experts : Cardiff".
J'aimerais voir ça.
Ou comment mesurer
la vitesse d'un kebab.
Merci de nous convier à ce bordel.
Maintenant ça suffit !
Pardon.
Excusez-moi.
Qui a isolé le corridor, là-haut ?
- Je croyais que c'était vous.
- Pourquoi ? Que s'est-il passé ?
Je l'ignore. À 9h, c'était là.
Pas d'explication. Produits chimiques ?
Il y a quelqu'un ?
Pardon, mais je cherche quelqu'un.
C'est pas malin,
ma vieille.
Vous n'auriez pas vu
un homme entrer ici ?
Grand. Dans une de ces longues
gabardines de l'armée.
D'accord. J'aimerais une réponse.
Ceci est une enquête de police.
Tout va bien ?
C'est assez réussi...
comme masque.
Pardon si je vous ai dérangé, mais...
Je crois qu'on peut arrêter ça.
C'est drôle un moment, ces sottises,
mais j'ai du travail.
Je cherche un homme
dans un grand manteau gris.
On peut arrêter ces sottises, j'ai dit.
Vous êtes là.
J'ai demandé au médecin-chef.
Il n'est au courant ni de la police
ni d'éventuels produits chimiques.
Ça peut être n'importe quoi.
Qui est là avec vous ?
Pas très efficace, leur isolation.
Dis-donc. Une sacrée trogne.
Vous savez, l'ami,
il y a la chirurgie esthétique.
Mais pas en CHU.
Ça va ?
Oui.
La vache, c'est bien foutu.
Comme dans... Hellraiser.
Un vrai boulot de pro.
Regardez-moi ça.
Les crocs, ils ont l'air vrai.
Courez ! Courez !
Plaquez-le au sol !
Au sol !
Immatriculation : Charlie Fox Trot
0-6 Fox Trot Delta Uniform.
CFT 06 FTDU. Reçu.
Tu as Yvonne en ligne.
Rien sur ton Capt. Jack Harkness.
Tu as regardé en dehors de Cardiff ?
Non... j'y aurais jamais pensé...
J'ai cherché au plan national.
Une quinzaine de John ou Jack Harkness.
Aucun n'est capitaine.
C'est peut-être un pseudo.
Le seul Capt. Harkness
dans les archives est américain.
C'est ça ! Il est américain.
Ce que tu as oublié de me dire.
- Qui est-ce ?
- Volontaire américain
au sein de l'Escadron 3 de Swansea.
Sauf qu'il a disparu.
- Aucune trace. Présumé mort.
- C'était quand ?
1941, au plus fort du Blitz.
Le matin du 21 Janvier 1941, le Capt.
Jack Harkness ne s'est pas présenté.
<i>Personne ne l'a plus revu.</i>
Qu'y a-t-il, Gwen ?
Tu as vu un fantôme ?
Hé ! Vous, là-bas !
Torchwood !
- Vous ne devez pas rester là.
- Police.
Je vois ça, n'empêche,
faut pas la laisser là.
Hé, je vous parle.
Excusez-moi.
Déplacez votre fichue bagnole !
Que donne l'immatriculation ?
<i>Inexistante.</i>
Comment ça ?
<i>Elle existe pas. Vérifié avec Swansea,
et re-vérifié. Rien du tout.</i>
<i>Aucun véhicule avec cette plaque.
Mais Temple a demandé après toi.</i>
<i>Tu es dans le pétrin ?</i>
J'ai dû marcher.
J'ai dû marcher, bordel.
Ils étaient là, puis envolés
l'instant d'après. Regarde !
Il n'y a pas de cachette.
Ils ont disparu d'un coup.
Temple ne te lâchera plus.
Il va disjoncter.
Il y avait un gars.
Je t'assure.
Un gardien, habillé en gardien,
et il s'est fait tuer.
Ou blesser. Certainement blessé.
Ça s'est passé devant moi.
Ce type masqué
l'a sauvagement agressé...
Je te le répète.
Tout le staff de l'hosto est au complet.
- Je l'ai vu.
- Allez, on arrête. Réfléchis.
Ça n'a ni queue, ni tête.
Tu es fatiguée.
Je te ramène.
- Ils étaient là.
- Laisse tomber.
T'as vu ça ?
Pot au feu.
Avec l'accent français.
J'aurais dû t'appeler.
Un travail à faire.
- Tu devrais être en arrêt-maladie.
- Je sais.
Il manque du monde ce soir,
et il y a match. Alors j'ai accepté.
M'en veux pas.
Tu me pardonnes ?
Allez. Dis que tu me pardonnes.
- Tu veux bien ?
- Ouais.
Faut que je file.
Excusez-moi.
Gwen Cooper, PJ.
Je mène une enquête ici,
dans la baie.
J'aimerais contrôler certains
de vos clients, si vous voulez bien.
Vous avez n'avez jamais livré
chez un Capt. Jack Harkness ?
- Je peux pas vous dire.
- Vous pourriez vérifier ?
C'est pas un de nos habitués.
J. Harkness, ou Harkness tout court ?
Ça ne fait rien.
Merci quand même.
Et Torchwood, ça ne vous dit rien ?
Si. Ils commandent souvent.
De bons clients.
Bonsoir. Désolé pour le retard.
Vous avez commandé des pizzas ?
- C'est à quel nom ?
- Je crois que c'est un M. Harkness.
Ne le faites pas attendre.
Je tiens plus. Désolé.
Je vaux rien.
Je laisse tomber.
- Il m'a fait rire.
- Vous avez tenu 2/10 de seconde.
Ce sont de vraies pizzas, en plus.
J'attendais qu'elle dise:
"Voici vos pizzas",
Je lui demande : "Combien ?"
Elle me répond : "20 livres".
Je lui dis que je suis à sec.
Je planchais sur le final.
Si on était allé jusque là.
Mais il aurait été fendant.
Voilà vos pizzas.
Je ferais mieux de m'en aller.
- Nous n'en sommes plus là.
- Vous deviez geler sur place, là-haut.
Combien d'heures
à tourner en rond ? Trois ?
Vous m'observiez ?
Et avant de poursuivre, qui passe
commande sous le nom de Torchwood ?
Ça doit être moi.
Désolé. J'suis grave.
Cet homme, à l'hôpital.
Le gardien. Comment est-il ?
C'était réel, n'est-ce pas ?
Il a bien été attaqué.
Il n'a pas survécu.
Mais on n'a rapporté
aucune disparition.
Nous avons emmené le corps, modifié
après coup son emploi du temps,
fabriqué un faux-témoin
l'ayant vu quitter l'hôpital,
ce qui lui procure un alibi
pour les prochaines 48 h,
de sorte que lorque son corps
sera repêché mardi soir,
sa disparition n'aura duré que 3 jours.
- C'était un meurtre.
- En effet.
- Et vous l'avez maquillé.
- C'est mon boulot.
Et l'autre homme ? John Tucker ?
Je vous ai vus, l'autre soir,
dans l'allée.
- Et qu'avez-vous vu ?
- Vous l'avez ranimé.
Qu'avez-vous vu ?
Vous l'avez ressuscité.
Qu'avez-vous vu ?
Vous l'avez ramené à la vie.
Qui êtes-vous ?
Torchwood.
Qu'est-ce que Torchwood ?
Torchwood, c'est ça.
Tout ce qui vous entoure.
Que va-t-il m'arriver ?
Je suis policier.
Agent de police Gwen Cooper.
Vous ne pouvez rien me faire.
Très bien, agent de police Cooper.
Aimeriez-vous venir voir ?
Qu'y a-t-il à voir ?
Vous avez assisté au meurtre.
Venez voir le meurtrier.
Suivez-le.
Torchwood, vous, cet endroit.
Qu'est-ce que tout cela ?
- Qu'est-ce que c'était ?
- Ptérodactyle.
Alors, vous venez ?
N'ayez pas peur.
Vous ne risquez rien.
Il est sous tranquilisants.
On appelle ça un Wevil.
Nous les avons baptisés ainsi.
On ne connaît pas leur vrai nom.
La communication n'étant pas leur fort.
Il y en a quelques centaines,
qui vivent dans les égouts,
à se nourrir de...
Ce sont des égouts.
Pas besoin de dessin.
Mais il arrive qu'un individu
se détache, monte à la surface,
et attaque. Les incidents deviennent
de plus en plus fréquents,
et on en ignore la raison.
Mais leur origine est extra-terrestre.
Regardez-le au fond des yeux.
Asseyez-vous.
Prenez votre temps.
Il vient d'un autre monde.
Et ce n'est pas une illusion.
Owen Harper.
Gwen Cooper.
Dr. Owen Harper, je vous prie.
Toshiko Sato, génie de l'informatique,
Susie Costello, mon second.
Et enfin Ianto Jones.
Il nettoie derrière nous,
et s'assure
que nous arrivions à l'heure.
Je fais de mon mieux.
Et il porte bien le costume.
Prenez garde, Monsieur.
C'est du harcèlement.
Pourquoi me révéler leurs identités ?
Je ne suis pas censée les connaître.
Tout ça est top secret, non ?
Plus que top secret.
Alors, il ne fallait pas m'en parler.
Qu'allez-vous faire de moi ?
À votre avis ?
J'en sais beaucoup trop.
Vos noms, le Wevil, et le reste...
Vous avez jeté un corps à l'eau,
et fabriqué une histoire sur sa mort.
Tosh, tu finiras
cette calibration demain.
Owen, occupe-toi de retrouver Chandler
et Bell. Ils nous mènent en bateau.
Ianto, tu as intérêt d'être là
s'il a besoin de renfort.
Susie !
Je sais que c'est rasoir, mais fais-moi
l'étude de coût pour le gant.
Quant à vous,
vous allez m'accompagner.
Je suis fatiguée de vous suivre.
Mais non.
Vous ne vous en lasserez jamais.
Montez là-dessus. Allons.
- À côté de moi.
- <i>Bonne soirée !</i>
<i>Salut, tout le monde !</i>
Vous êtes entrée
par la porte de devant.
Prenons un chemin plus pittoresque.
Ils doivent bien voir l'ascenseur.
Pourquoi ils ne...?
Nous sommes bien visibles.
Ils ne peuvent pas nous rater.
Donnent-ils l'impression
de nous voir ?
Non, mais regardez-nous !
Nous ne pourrions être plus exposés.
Bonsoir !
Hé, vous, là-bas !
Bonsoir !
Cela s'appelle
un filtre de perception.
Il peut nous voir,
mais nous ne cadrons pas.
Comme un objet dans le coin de l'œil.
Ça ne marche qu'à cet endroit précis.
Une fois en dehors...
Salut !
C'est une belle soirée.
Voilà, nous sommes perçus.
Quel est son principe ?
Aucune idée.
On sait s'en servir, pas l'expliquer.
Mon hypothèse est qu'il existait
un circuit caméléon transcendental
à cet endroit-même, et qui a greffé
ses propriétés perceptives
sur une faille spatio-temporelle.
Je sais, ça a l'air ridicule.
Va pour ascenseur invisible.
Plus évocateur, non ?
Et le trou ? Si personne ne le voit
lorsque l'ascenseur remonte,
il est béant,
les gens ne tombent pas dedans ?
- C'est tellement gallois.
- Quoi ?
Je vous montre un truc fabuleux,
et vous cherchez la petite bête.
- Je n'arrive pas à comprendre...
- Moi, ce que je ne comprends pas,
c'est que vous persistiez
dans cette attitude de rejet.
Que vous faut-il comme preuves
de l'existence des aliens ?
Et cet énorme vaisseau apparu dans
le ciel de Londres le jour de Noël ?
Et la bataille rangée sur Canary Wharf ?
L'invasion des Cybermen ?
Mon ami considère
que c'est un genre de terrorisme.
Ils auraient mis quelque chose
dans l'eau potable.
Un puissant psychotrope qui aurait
déclenché des hallucinations de masse.
Votre ami est un crétin.
Vous le connaissez ?
Ainsi donc...
vous chassez les aliens.
- C'est votre métier.
- C'est exact.
- Vous êtes chasseur d'aliens.
- En effet.
- De beaux spécimens ?
- Une floppée.
- Un sacré boulot.
- Je confirme.
C'est carrément space.
Qui êtes-vous, au juste ?
Capt. Jack Harkness.
J'ai fait quelques recherches.
Il n'y a qu'un Capt. Jack Harkness
dans les registres.
- Porté disparu en 1941.
- Eh bien...
Impossible que ce soit moi.
N'est-ce pas ?
Nous ne nous bornons pas
à attraper les aliens.
Nous récupérons le matériel
qu'ils laissent derrière eux,
et tentons de l'exploiter afin de mieux
armer la race humaine pour le futur.
Le 21e siècle est une époque charnière.
- Il faudra être prêt.
- Qui vous supervise ? Le gouvernement ?
Nous sommes indépendants
du gouvernement, extérieurs à la police,
et au-delà des Nations-Unis.
Car si une puissance s'emparait
de ces technologies,
elle pourrait en user
pour servir ses propres fins.
Ça vaut aussi pour vous.
Aucun objet extra-terrestre
ne sort de la base.
Interdiction d'en emporter un
hors de l'enceinte.
Continuez. Comment avez-vous fait
pour atterrir à Cardiff ?
Nous sommes Torchwood 3.
Torchwood 1, c'était Londres.
Détruit dans la bataille.
Torchwood 2, un bureau à Glasgow.
Des hommes très étranges.
Torchwood 3, Cardiff.
On a égaré Torchwood 4,
mais on le retrouvera bien un jour.
Alors Cardiff,
c'est un coup de cœur ?
La ville est traversée
par une faille spatio-temporelle.
Les Wevils ne débarquent pas
d'un vaisseau.
Ils sont passés à travers la faille.
Toutes sortes de choses aboutissent ici.
Créatures, glissements temporels,
déchets spatiaux en tous genres...
- Épaves flottantes.
- Oui, c'est bien Cardiff.
N'en dites pas du mal.
J'y habite.
D'où êtes-vous, en réalité ?
De toutes sortes d'endroit.
Nous pourrions travailler en liaison.
Le tueur en série. Je peux être
votre trait d'union avec la police.
Je vois là où il y a confusion.
Notre intervention sur la scène du crime
vous a fait croire
que nous pourchassions le tueur.
Je regrette,
mais nous n'y sommes en rien mêlés.
- Alors, qu'y faisiez-vous ?
- Un test sur le gant.
Ça nécessite d'avoir une victime
de meurtre. Le gant n'opère que sur
des cadavres récents.
Plus la mort est violente,
plus aisé ce sera de le ramener.
C'était de la chair fraîche.
Vous avez interrogé ce John Tucker.
Je vous ai vu.
Lui demander de décrire le meurtrier.
Il venait de se faire tuer.
Que lui demander d'autre ?
L'identité du tueur. Ce serait utile.
- Nous sommes débordés.
- Et votre travail est plus important.
Vous avez enfin compris.
Dommage pour vous.
Car si vous me laissez partir,
mon devoir est de les avertir.
Ce gant peut être d'un grand service.
À condition de s'en rappeler.
Que voulez-vous dire ?
La bière est bonne ?
Vous m'avez empoisonnée ?
N'en faites pas un drame.
Une simple pillule de l'oubli.
Un recette à moi. Une pointe
de rejet, et un doigt de groseille.
Demain matin, vous n'aurez plus
aucun souvenir de Torchwood.
Et pire encore,
vous m'aurez oublié.
C'est assez tragique.
Inutile de lutter pour rester éveillée.
J'y ai ajouté un sédatif.
Je vais le raconter à quelqu'un.
Vraiment ? Voulez-vous
que l'on s'occupe d'eux aussi ?
- Espèce d'enfoiré !
- Châtiez votre langage.
Ravi de vous avoir connu,
Gwen Cooper.
...aux commandes de Torchwood 3.
Un autre homme...
...du nom de Owen Harper,
docteur en sciences.
- Bonsoir.
- 'soir.
- Vous passez un bon moment ?
- Jusque là.
- Je vous offre un verre ?
- Non, merci. J'ai le mien.
Est-ce que je perds mon temps ?
Je sais pas. Vous croyez ?
Bon. Je dois me lever tôt.
Grosse journée demain.
Alors je vais me dispenser
de bavardage.
Alors...
Vous le voulez, ce verre ?
Je me sens en feu.
Tu viens avec moi. Tout de suite !
...26, 27 ans, et une Japonaise
qui s'appelle Toshiko (nom de famille ?)
Un Conte de Deux Villes

Viens ici, connard !
Linda ! Que fais-tu avec lui ?
T'es malade ?
Je l'emmène chez moi, et je me le fais.
Fiche le camp !
Que fais-tu avec ma copine, p'tit con ?
Je savais pas. Elle était seule.
Elle a rien dit.
- P'tit branleur, va !
- Ferme-la, Conley ! Il est à moi !
- Tu veux qu'on s'explique, hein ?
- On va pas se compliquer.
Tu vas y avoir droit.
Attends ton tour.

TORCHWOOD
CAPT JACK
GWEN COOPER:
INTERCEPTION-DOMICILE
EFFACER
T'es rentrée bourrée ?
- Quelle heure il est ?
- 7h30.
Tu ne travaillais pas, hier soir ?
- Si.
- Pourquoi tu pionçais ici, alors ?
Je dormais pas,
je tapais un truc.
- C'est du boulot.
- Je te faisais pas de reproche.
Mais c'est pas malin de faire la fête
après avoir pris un coup sur la tête.
J'espère que t'as pas pris le volant.
T'étais avec qui ? Diane ?
Sûrement.
- Alors, ça avance ?
- Quoi donc ?
Capt. Jack Harkness.
Qui ça ? De qui tu parles ?
Vas-y, t'occupe pas de moi.
Continue de me faire perdre mon temps.
Bonjour !
On vient au cœur de l'action ?
Oui, Monsieur.
Tout à fait.
- Comment se passe l'enquête ?
- Ça piétine.
C'est l'arme du crime ?
Ils sont pas manchots, au labo.
Générée par ordinateur.
Ils ont mesuré le contour des plaies.
Et en ont déduit la forme
de la lame, et le reste.
Même les deux latérales.
Me demandez pas comment ils font.
Une arme effrayante, en tout cas.
Vous l'avez déjà vue ?
On cherche sa provenance.
Il ne doit pas en exister beaucoup.
Décoratif, il me semble.
On vérifie les registres des douanes
au cas où elle aurait été importée.
Le couteau peut nous mener au meurtrier.
Si vous avez quelque chose,
n'hésitez pas à passer.
D'accord. Merci.
...il arrête pas de râler. Qui loue
le terrain, paie les remplaçants...
...l'éviter. Je vais pas sauter dans
un camion juste pour aller la voir...
Centre Gallois du Millénaire
"Souviens toi"
"Souviens toi"
On se retrouve.
Vous aviez raison. Vous avez suggéré
à Jack de travailler en liaison
avec la police.
Je fus la seule à m'y intéresser.
Et par conséquent,
la seule à avoir lu le rapport.
Ils l'ont bien décrit.
Je vous arrête pour...
Où vous-ai je rencontrée ?
J'ai pensé
que vous aviez pu le voir.
Une certaine image peut lever l'amnésie,
pour quelqu'un de futé.
Il disait que vous étiez douée.
Bref, au point où j'en suis,
je ne peux vous...
Vous allez résister.
J'ai donc ceci...
Une seconde. Pardon.
Voilà, c'est mieux.
- Posez ça.
- Pourquoi être revenue ?
- Posez cette arme.
- Vous seule pouvez établir le lien.
Du moins...
La seule à l'extérieur.
Torchwood le saura, au matin.
Mais je serai partie.
J'ignore où.
Mais très loin.
Qu'est-ce que je vais devenir ?
J'aimais mon travail.
Passionnément.
Me voilà contrainte de fuir.
Oh, Seigneur.
Comment retravailler, après ça ?
Je vous en prie,
posez cette arme.
On en est imprégné.
Après un certain temps,
on finit par se dire...
Pourquoi ça tombe sur nous,
les Wevils et monstres de tout poil.
C'est ça, les formes de vie
extra-terrestre ? Des horreurs ?
Peut-être en existe-t-il
de plus réussies.
De fabuleuses...
de magnifiques entités.
Mais elles ne viennent jamais ici.
Cette planète crasseuse
n'attire que les rebuts.
Je ne comprends pas
ce que vous dites.
J'aimerais tant pouvoir oublier.
- Pourquoi avoir tué ces gens ?
- Pour le gant.
Ne... n'approchez pas.
J'avais besoin des corps. C'est ainsi.
Des morts violentes.
C'était si facile. Pour les ramener,
je me plaçais derrière eux.
- Ils ne me voient jamais 2 fois.
- Vous avez tué 3 personnes.
Je ne pouvais faire autrement.
Plus je me servais du gant,
et plus je le maîtrisais.
- Quel gant ? Où vous-ai vu auparavant ?
- Avec assez d'expérience, pensez
à ce que ce gant peut accomplir.
Si je parviens à aller
au delà des 2 minutes,
à le faire marcher de manière
permanente, il abolira la mort.
Résurrection à la demande,
n'est-ce pas fantastique ?
Vous n'êtes pas d'accord ?
C'est le but que
je poursuivais sans relâche.
Pendant que les autres se pâmaient,
je suais sang et eau.
Cette chose finit par vous habiter.
Vous vous donnez à elle.
Je l'ai fait,
avec la lame et le gant.
C'est pourquoi je suis insensible
au filtre de perception.
Qui est cet homme ?
D'où est-il sorti ?
Qu'avez-vous fait ?
S'il vous plaît. Non.
Je ne peux vous laisser partir.
- Je vous en prie.
- J'y suis forcée.
Je regrette.
Je suis désolée.
Je dois le faire.
Il le faut.
Il le faut.
Lâche ton arme.
C'est terminé, Susie.
Viens avec moi.
Je...
...me souviens.
Je me souviens.
USAGE PROHIBÉ
Owen, et Toshiko...
Vous ne leur avez pas dit
que vous avez  survécu
à un tir en pleine tête.
Vous n'avez rien dit, non plus.
Vous prenez exemple sur moi.
Continuez ainsi,
et vous vous en sortirez.
Mais elle vous avait tué.
Je ne peux pas mourir.
Je ne peux pas.
Il m'est arrivé quelque chose,
il y a longtemps.
Une longue histoire,
loin d'ici.
J'avais trouvé la mort.
Mais je fus ramené à la vie,
et depuis lors, je ne peux pas mourir.
- Comment est-ce...
- Je l'ignore.
Un jour, je trouverai un docteur,
le bon docteur qui saura m'expliquer.
- Mais en attendant...
- Rien ne peut vous tuer ?
Les gens ont peur de ces choses-là.
Il vaut mieux les garder pour vous.
Ça n'a pas grande importance.
Puisque vous m'effacerez la mémoire.
Pourquoi le ferais-je ?
Nous avons un poste vacant.
La place est disponible.
Voulez-vous l'occuper ?
Mais...
À quoi vous serais-je utile ?
Vous aviez peut-être raison.
Nous pourrions aider davantage.
Qu'en dites-vous ?
Vous êtes des nôtres ?
Oui.
Oui, je veux en être.
Torchwood, indépendant
du gouvernement, extérieur à la police,
sa mission :
trouver et étudier les aliens,
en vue d'armer l'humanité pour le futur.
Le 21e siècle
est une époque charnière.
Et vous devez être prêts.
C'est la dernière fois
que tu choisis le film.
- On m'avait dit qu'il était bien.
- J'ai roupillé, Rhys.
Ça veut dire quoi,
"Opérations Spéciales" ?
Rien de mirifique.
Surtout du classement.
Administration spéciale, alors.
- On peut parler d'autre chose ?
- Mais non !
Tu commences demain,
c'est génial ! Grosse promotion.
- Juste un détachement.
- Tu vas les épater.
- Et si on rentrait plus tôt.
- La note, s'il vous plaît !
Bon Dieu !
C'est quoi, un avion en feu ?
C'est pas un avion.
- On n'a pas réglés.
- Viens donc !
C'était quoi, ça ?
Faut que j'aille bosser.
Traduction : Herb
Synchro : jh26
Simple opération de nettoyage.
Trouver cette météorite
avant que d'autres n'arrivent.
Ravi de te revoir, au fait.
- Tosh, tu l'as localisée ?
- Tu as ce qu'il faut ?
Surveillance et localisation de base.
Le site du crash.
Accès aux TV en circuit fermé
et aux bases de données nationales.
C'est CRIMINT ? Le système d'infos de
la police. Vous n'êtes pas autorisés !
Et si tu cessais de dire "vous"
pour dire "nous" ?
Le site est à 100m, droit devant.
Merde.
Les amateurs nous ont précédés.
Bien. Formation standard.
C'est quoi la formation standard ?
- Ça varie.
- Si c'est standard, pourquoi ça varie ?
- Vous sortez d'où, vous ?
- Oh, pardon.
- Zone contrôlée.
- C'est bon, je suis avec...
Les Opérations Spéciales.
Je suis avec eux.
- Torchwood. Je suis avec Torchwood.
- On joue pas, fillette.
Vous n'êtes pas avec Torchwood.
Et même si c'était vrai...
Vous sortiriez
la pancarte de bienvenue !
D'abord, c'est plus une fillette.
Elle a tout ce qu'il faut,
là où il faut.
Elle est de Torchwood. Nous le sommes.
Et vous seriez gentils
de nous laisser faire le vrai boulot.
On y va ?
Voyons ce qu'on a ici.
- Ça donne quoi ?
- Étron spatial classique.
- C'est un terme technique.
- Ouais, merci...
Alors, faites vos relevés,
on ne va pas s'éterniser.
Rends-toi utile, trésor.
- Passe-moi le gros burin.
- C'est Gwen, pas "trésor".
- Une syllabe, tu sauras ?
- Et lapin ? Ou pitchoune ? Bleue ?
Dommage que ton outil
soit trop petit, poussin.
- Attrape !
- Non ! Et merde !
Mets ça !
Tu me joues le coup du répondeur ?
T'es avec elle, c'est ça ?
Salaud, même pas daigné
envoyer un texto.
J'étais seule comme une conne, là-bas.
J'en ai marre d'avoir toujours
à t'attendre.
Je regrette de t'avoir rencontré.
Je voudrais crever, non,
je voudrais que tu crèves.
Rappelle-moi.
- Bonsoir, mesdemoiselles.
- Salut, beau gosse.
Bien gaulée.
Tu vas où, comme ça ?
Je suis juste sortie
passer un coup de fil.
Sortie définitive.
Bon, ça va, passe.
Prenez-en de la graine, les mecs.
Je sais même pas ton nom.
On peut s'en passer.
Je vais pas... pouvoir...
me retenir.
Ben, lâche-toi.
Allez... T'es trop...
C'est... le pied.
- Je suis vraiment désolée.
- Arrête de te répéter.
Mais c'est vrai ! Non, vraiment !
Vraiment, vraiment désolée.
Bon sang, c'est trop bête.
Y a pas de cours de sécurité
chez les flics ?
Je vous ai vus vous jeter des trucs...
- On loupe pas, nous.
- Je vais arranger ça.
Quoi qu'il se soit passé,
je m'en charge.
Il s'est passé quoi, à ton avis ?
Juste un gaz qui s'est échappé, non ?
C'est pas trop grave, si ?
Oui, c'est connu
pour être inoffensif.
Le bon côté, c'est qu'on a le matériau,
en assez bon état.
Le mauvais côté,
c'est qu'on a un alien dans la nature,
on ne sait pas où il est, ce qu'il
fait ici, et ce qu'il compte faire.
Soyez un peu sympas.
C'est le pire 1er jour de l'histoire.
Tout le monde peut se tromper. Allons
récupérer la chose qui en est sortie.
Voilà un indice. Un appel à Police
Secours pour 1 mort en boîte de nuit.
Les circonstances sont...
pour le moins étranges.
Peut-être un lien.
Torchwood.
- Gwen ?
- Salut !
Ben dis donc ! Tu es sur ton 31.
Opérations Spéciales !
On se demandait.
Je voulais vous appeler.
- C'est un peu la folie.
Vas-y, raconte.
- Tu viens ?
- Oui, désolée.
Tu peux partir.
Inutile de te geler ici.
T'es mon chef, maintenant ?
Passe le bonjour à tout le monde.
C'est tout ce qu'il en reste ?
Comment ça se peut ?
Dites-nous plutôt comment vous saviez
que c'était un corps.
Vas-y, p'tit ! J'suis à fond avec toi !
Ça m'a drôlement secoué.
Montrez-nous cette bande.
- Dieu du ciel !
- Il a...
...tiré, et s'est tiré.
J'aimerais partir comme ça.
- On peut t'arranger ça.
- Comment est-ce possible ?
Ça n'a aucun sens.
- C'est pas possible.
- Vous connaissez le nom de la fille ?
Ils sont arrivés ensemble
ou se sont rencontrés à l'intérieur ?
C'est une habituée ?
Quelqu'un ici la connaît ?
J'en sais rien !
On a des centaines d'entrées
chaque week-end.
- Je tiens pas un livre.
- Merci pour votre aide.
Nous avons ce que nous voulions.
Comment ça ? On n’a rien.
Même pas son nom.
Sortez-moi un corps de cryo,
qui puisse passer pour le défunt.
Défiguré, à laisser dans un lieu
éloigné. Que ça ait l'air d'un suicide.
Vous avez une provision de cadavres ?
Et sa famille ?
Vous n'allez pas déguiser sa mort.
Va leur dire que c'est dû
à un coït avec un alien.
On n'en est pas certains.
Mêmes éléments que ceux du site.
Des traces partout dans la boîte,
mais très évidentes ici.
Il y a eu quelque chose ici.
C'est de ma faute.
Sans ma gaffe,
il serait encore en vie.
Ça ne sert à rien de gamberger.
Au moins, on en sait un peu plus.
L'alien a pris possession d'un corps.
On doit l'empêcher de tuer à nouveau.
Je leur dis, vous vous mettez vous-mêmes
au chômdu, avec vos conneries.
Je peux avoir 5 Polonais
qui font jamais de pauses,
heureux comme des gamins,
le tout pour 56 £ et les repas.
À Niall je fais, "Pourquoi prendre
tes râleurs quand je peux avoir ça ?"
- Carys ?
- Papa ?
Sacrée biture, hein ?
Qu'est-ce que t'as fichu, hier soir ?
Je me rappelle pas trop.
J'étais déchirée.
Je file.
Tony veut le fourgon avant 9 h.
Tu es là, ce soir ?
- Ça fait quoi, ça ?
- J'utilise le monitoring satellite
pour calculer la trajectoire entrante
de la météorite.
Il dit qu'il essaie de trouver
d'où elle vient.
Le technojargon, ça forme le caractère.
- Un planificateur de route, en gros.
- Pas loin.
Rhys, mon copain, est responsable
logistique. Il fait ce genre de choses.
- À un moindre niveau.
- Tu as un copain ?
- Oui, pas toi ?
- Pas le temps, avec ce boulot.
- Et toi ? Tu vois quelqu'un ?
- Tu rigoles.
J'ai déjà assez de chicaneries ici.
Aucun de vous n'est en couple ?
Juste toi, la bleue.
Je veux pas être indiscrète.
Bon, je le suis, mais...
que faites-vous
pour vous évader de tout ça ?
Pour vous changer les idées ?
Je torture les gens heureux en ménage.
Traces de gaz identifiées :
Vorax et Suranium.
Mes préférés. Vérifiez
et décortiquez-moi ça.
- Je suis dessus.
- Que fait le programme ?
Je compare le visage de la fille avec
le reste de la population du pays.
Ça ne peut contenir
tous les habitants du Royaume-Uni.
Ce serait enfreindre les libertés
individuelles, la confidentialité, etc.
Toujours le "vous"
par rapport au "nous" ?
119 suspects.
Il ne devait sortir
qu'une concordance.
Trop basse résolution. Rien à faire,
même en l'augmentant et en grossissant.
Le logiciel ne traite pas correctement.
Il a réduit les possibilités.
Je peux faire le reste, à l'ancienne.
À l'œil nu.
Et les empreintes prises
sur le mur dans l'allée ?
- Il y avait peu de chance.
- Tu crois ?
- J'essaie, au moins.
- Tu ferais n'importe quoi.
La vidéo a dû filmer son arrivée.
Tosh, tu peux reconfigurer le programme
de reconnaissance d'images
pour retracer son trajet
avec les caméras dans la rue ?
Ce sera long à traiter.
Des milliers de probabilités
à chaque coin de rue.
Essaie. Au moins,
on aura un point de départ.
On pourrait les croiser
avec les 119 autres.
Bien joué, la bleue !
Voilà qui est parlé !
Tu es la sauveuse de notre site web.
Alors, ton père n'est pas là ?
- Enlève tes fringues !
- Du calme, Carys !
Bon, ça suffit.
Assez rigolé.
Encore un coup de Barry, hein ?
Ta gueule !
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Remontez votre froc, et sortez !
Vite !
- Ça me peine toujours de dire ça.
- C'est respirable.
Gwen, attention !
- C'est quoi, ça ?
- Genre de cellule gonflable.
Une heure d'autonomie.
C'est une daube, leur batterie.
- Qui t'a permis de t'en servir ?
- Je l'ai empêchée de s'échapper.
Tu connais la règle. Rien ne sort
sans ma permission.
D'accord. Pas la peine de me remercier.
Venez avec nous.
Vois ce que tu peux en tirer.
Je fais ça toute seule ?
Je sais pas ce qu'il faut faire.
Vaut mieux éviter de dire ça
devant le prisonnier.
Vous êtes du MI-5 ?
Où suis-je ? Que voulez-vous ?
Je crois que vous le savez, Carys.
Qui vous a donné mon nom ?
J'ai jamais eu d'ennuis.
Que me voulez-vous ?
Je sais que quelque chose
vit à l'intérieur de vous,
ce qu'il vous a obligée à faire.
La victime s'appelait Matt Stevens.
Ses parents ont perdu
leur seul enfant à 3 h 07 ce matin.
Vous avez brisé mon vaisseau.
Parlez. D'où venez-vous
et pourquoi vouloir envahir la Terre ?
Nous ne deviendrons pas vos esclaves.
Qui parle d'esclaves ?
C'est bien ce que vous faites, non ?
Vous autres aliens.
Non, je ne veux que l'énergie.
L'extase.
C'est ce qui me nourrit.
Ah, pardon.
Résumons-nous.
Vous venez ici pour faire
le plein d'orgasmes ?
Je ne connais rien de meilleur.
Vous avez un goût sublime.
Vous êtes ce qui se fait de mieux.
Aidez-moi.
Je vous en prie,
faites qu'il sorte de moi.
Carys ?
Purée !
C'est la fête.
OK, premier contact avec un alien.
C'est assez inattendu.
Hé, les amis... C'est top !
Elle disait avoir un copain.
Vous et votre manie de cataloguer.
Il faudrait peut-être
la sortir de là.
Ouais... Mais oui ! Allons-y !
Mais... on se garde un petit souvenir.
Non ! Ça ne va pas.
Il faut que ce soit un homme.
Je perds pied.
Promettez-moi de m'aider.
Promettez-le-moi.
Je vous le promets.
Salut.
- T'es encore au taf ?
- Malheureusement.
- Tu finis à quelle heure ?
- Je sais pas encore.
- C'est excitant, comme travail, non ?
- Ouais, en partie.
Je te dérange pas ?
Je suis un peu prise, là.
Pauvre de moi,
le veuf des Opérations Spé.
Je t'appelle plus tard.
Ciao.
Bravo, la bleue ! Voilà ce que
j'appelle une enquête fouillée.
J'attends avec impatience la suite.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Lâche-moi !
Cette fille est envahie par
on ne sait quoi. Et tu peux blaguer ?
- Ça va ! Désolé.
- On ferait mieux de l'aider.
- C'est pas un rat de laboratoire.
- Non, c'est une meurtrière.
Tu voulais absolument la coincer.
Et soudain, vous êtes copains
comme cochons ?
Tu sais, strictement parlant,
c'est mon job d'étrangler le staff.
Qui a envie de chinois ?
Alors elle a dit...
"Si j'avais su qui il était,
je ne l'aurais jamais épousé !"
- Elle le savait dès le départ !
- Mais elle s'en fichait.
Jusqu'au jour où il laissa dans
la baignoire ces grosses morves noires.
C'est ce qui les perd. Les aliens
sont nuls en hygiène domestique.
En parlant de ça,
faut que j'aille pisser.
- Alors, que t'a-t-il raconté ?
- À propos de quoi ?
- De lui !
- Vous étiez là bien avant moi.
- On comptait sur toi.
- C'est toi le flic rompu
- aux interrogatoires.
- Vous ne savez rien de lui ?
Ni qui il est, ni d'où il vient.
Rien, à part qu'il est gay.
Non, c'est pas vrai.
Ah oui, vous croyez ?
Owen y croit. Pas moi.
Moi, je m'en fous.
Le style militaire de la vieille époque,
ça fait pas hétéro.
Ça lui va bien, je trouve.
Dans le genre classique.
Exactement ! Je l'ai vu à l'œuvre.
Il se ferait n'importe qui
pourvu qu'il soit beau.
- On sait qu'il est américain.
- C'est pas prouvé.
Pas de Jack Harkness né américain
dans les 50 dernières années.
C'est peut-être une info confidentielle.
C'était un gros bonnet à la CIA.
Enfin, c'est ce que je crois.
Il doit avoir ses raisons,
pour ne rien dévoiler.
C'est sûr. Ça m'empêchera pas
de chercher à les connaître.
C'était quoi, ce bruit ?
On est là, à se régaler pendant
qu'une fille se bat pour rester en vie ?
En fait, pendant qu'on mange, le système
fait un bioscan complet de Carys,
profil sanguin, métabolisme,
organes, peau, la totale.
On saura ainsi quel effet l'alien
a sur elle. Il prélève aussi
des échantillons d'air de sa cellule
pour mesurer l'altération de son milieu.
Ça te suffit,
ou il te faut plus ? Parce que...
Ça devient vite rasoir.
Vous vous enterrez ici
depuis trop longtemps.
À ne penser qu'aux aliens,
vous avez perdu le sens de l'humain.
Rafraîchis-nous la mémoire.
Dis-nous ce que c'est que
d'être humain au 21e siècle.
Si vous voulez.
Carys Fletcher,
née le 13 novembre 1987.
Bulletins scolaires,
dossier de l'agence d'intérim,
brevets de nageuse, rapports sur
l'accident qui a coûté la vie à sa mère.
Et les emails sur les qualités comparées
d'Orlando Bloom et d'Heath Ledger.
- À quoi ça t'avance ?
- Oublions les météorites ou les gaz.
On a une fille prisonnière
qu'il faut absolument sauver.
Là-bas dans la cellule,
elle m'a dit qu'elle perdait pied.
Il faut l'encourager à se battre,
à s'accrocher
à celle qu'elle est vraiment.
J'ai quelque chose sur la figure ?
Non.
Je trouve ça... remarquable.
Tu es remarquable.
Merci.
Faisons venir son père.
Tu plaisantes.
- Nous devons tisser un lien avec elle.
L'aider à lutter.
Notre rôle est de contenir
la menace alien. Pas de les mettre
- en présence de civils.
- C'est à nous de l'aider.
- S'il n'y a aucun moyen...
- Qui le fera, sinon nous ?
Es-tu toujours aussi bornée ?
Vous devriez venir voir.
Voilà la composition de l'air
dans la cellule en temps normal.
Et ça, c'est ce qu'on a
depuis une heure.
L'alien secrète un mélange
ultra puissant de phéromones aérosol.
Phéromones sexuelles.
1 000 fois plus actives que celles
qu'on rencontre d'habitude.
- C'est un aphrodisiaque ambulant !
- Voilà pourquoi...
En fait, je l'ai un peu embrassée.
On sait.
Tu veux toujours que son père
entre là-dedans ?
Oh, non ! Aucun homme à proximi...
Owen !
Jack, Carys a quitté sa cellule.
La petite garce m'a tiré
ma carte d'accès.
Je m'en charge.
Dites à Owen de travailler ses abdos.
Je faisais des relevés,
avec un œil sur elle, et boum.
Tu t'en tires à bon compte.
Bénis le ciel
qu'elle n'en voulait qu'à ta carte.
Ça va mieux ?
Ou te sens-tu un peu couillon ?
Pas de sortie, désolé.
Alors ? T'as envie d'en découdre ?
Faisons ça à la loyale.
Vous ne m'arrêterez pas.
Pose ça ! Ça n'a de valeur
que pour moi.
Pose ! Ou je tire.
Qu'il dit,
mais ses yeux disent le contraire.
Je sors.
N'essayez pas de m'arrêter.
Aidez-moi !
- Je passe à l'attaque, Monsieur ?
- Merci pour l'offre.
Ouvre simplement la porte.
Allez, rends-moi le récipient.
Malgré ce qu'on s'est dit,
une main coupée vaut plus pour vous
que la vie de Carys.
Tu veux faire tes preuves ?
Retrouve-la. Demande à tes amis flics
de se rendre utile, pour une fois.
Très bien, je les appelle.
Avis de recherche...
femme possédée par gaz,
baise les gars à mort.
Hé ! Vous feriez mieux de venir !
J'essayais de comprendre
les données du bioscan.
Mais ça part dans tous les sens,
sans parvenir à se stabiliser.
Parce que tout dans son corps
continue de changer,
rien n'est constant.
Dès qu'on croit tenir
quelque chose, le rythme métabolique,
la tension redeviennent fous.
Elle se bat pour garder
le contrôle de son corps.
Bref, j'ai entrepris
un diagnostic comparatif.
J'ai recréé les conditions,
légèrement accéléré le processus
- pour voir les effets sur Carys.
- Merci.
J'ai infecté le rat avec
un mélange de Vorax et
de Suranium trouvés sur le site
et dans la boîte de nuit.
Il n'a pas l'air affecté.
Une fois le corps baigné de gaz,
c'est là que la fête commence.
Le rythme cardiaque triple. Le cerveau
enfle, et fait pression sur le crâne.
Puis les poumons se contractent,
rendant la respiration impossible.
Les organes internes subissent
une telle pression qu'à la fin...
- Purée de rat !
- C'est ce qui attend Carys ?
- "Je perds pied", elle m'a dit ça.
- En ce moment, c'est une bataille
entre ce qui reste d'elle
et l'envahisseur alien.
Il faut penser comme elle.
Nous mettre à sa place.
C'est le seul moyen pour l'atteindre.
Sauf qu'on ignore
quelle pulsion a pris le dessus.
Carys ou bien l'alien. Je n'ai constaté
qu'une lutte pour le contrôle.
La pulsion sexuelle est le facteur
primaire pour le parasite.
Un instinct de survie. C'est forcément
sa motivation première.
Supposons que vous êtes Carys.
Vous avez soif de sexe, car
c'est ce que réclame l'envahisseur,
mais vous savez que c'est mortel.
Où iriez-vous ?
Ici, pour te troncher.
Je blague ! On peut plus
se chambrer entre collègues ?
Pas en ce moment, non.
Alors où ?
Lupanars ? Boîtes de strip-tease ?
Là où vont les amateurs ?
Je sais ce que je ferais.
Qu'est-ce que tu viens faire ?
Tu m'as l'air énervé.
- Fallait que je te voie.
- T'aurais pu appeler.
Si Bethan était là...
- Je pourrais te tuer.
- Je pourrais te dire la même chose.
C'est quoi ce texto que tu m'as laissé ?
T'étais à côté de tes pompes.
Si je voulais, je pourrais
te tuer... tout de suite.
Écoute, je te l'ai dit.
Je quitterai pas Bethan.
T'es sympa, mais ça n'arrivera pas.
Je ne l'avais jamais fait, avant.
Je ne te l'ai pas dit
parce que tu te serais moqué.
T'es qu'un salaud.
Tu veux juste prendre ton pied.
Je suis qu'un coup.
Allez, vas-y. Défoule-toi.
Est-ce que tu m'aimes, Eddie ?
M'as-tu jamais aimée ?
Tu as eu ta chance.
Quoi ?
On arrive trop tard.
Tosh a vu juste, cependant.
Elle s'en est prise à l'ex.
Elle est jeune, heureusement.
Si c'était moi, on serait là
jusqu'à la fin des temps.
- Et maintenant ?
- Combien de temps avant que
cette chose ne la détruise.
- Bon, on fait quoi ?
- Empêcher tout Cardiff de forniquer ?
- Mettre du bromure dans l'eau courante.
- Trop aléatoire.
La compagnie des eaux
n'a pas apprécié la dernière fois.
- Il avait le choix. Pourquoi elle ?
- Le hasard, je suppose.
Il pompe sa substance
pour arriver à ses fins.
Que sait-on d'autre sur elle ?
- Tu as une idée ?
- Pourquoi vous me regardez tous ?
- C'est toi, la profileuse !
- Je sais pas. Désolée.
Elle est d'enfer, sous pression.
On va bien trouver.
C'est quoi, son boulot, déjà ?
Intérimaire. Réceptionniste.
- Où, en ce moment ?
- Je sors son dossier.
- La clinique Conway.
- Sans déconner.
Un problème ?
Clinique pour les gens stériles.
Donneurs de sperme.
De l'orgasme à gogo
sans les préliminaires.
Jackpot.
Carys. Tu travailles pas
aujourd'hui, si ?
Il lui en faut plus.
L'énergie... elle s'épuise.
Comment ?
M. Tunstall, cabine 1,
s'il vous plaît.
- Je fais quoi, avec ?
- T'as besoin d'un dessin ?
Je ne sais pas m'en servir.
- Mais tu étais flic !
- Je battais le pavé.
Prends. Je ferai en sorte
que t'aies pas à l'utiliser.
- Je te demande de sortir !
- Détends-toi, je vais t'aider.
Sûrement pas, je suis homo !
Que fait-on si on la trouve ?
- Comment faire pour extirper l'alien ?
- À en juger par les examens,
il lui faut un hôte,
le gaz ne peut survivre
à une exposition prolongée à l'air.
Le corps humain
fait un parfait réceptacle.
Donc, si on réussit
à l'isoler du corps...
- Il ne survivra pas longtemps.
- Nous voilà avec un plan.
Le forcer à mourir.
Il l'a bien fait à ces pauvres types.
- Qu'arrivera-t-il à Carys?
- Prie pour qu'on la retrouve à temps.
Pressons !
Tout le monde ! Dehors !
Éloignez-vous le plus possible !
Seigneur, combien d'autres ?
Ici !
Plus d'échappatoire.
Tout ce sexe. Tout ce que
nous voyons, toutes ces pensées.
Tant de beauté... et tant de peur.
Nous le désirons,
mais cela nous effraie tant...
La pression sur son corps
est trop forte.
- D'ici peu, c'est de la purée de rat.
- Encore un, et je serais rétablie.
Chaque fois, l'effet diminue.
Chaque fois,
je ressens de moins en moins.
Encore un.
Aidez-moi à me sentir en vie.
À me sentir humaine.
Je ne peux pas.
Moi, si.
J'ai de la vie en excédent.
Je peux m'en séparer.
Tu veux vraiment sentir quelque chose ?
Il fait quoi, là ?
Ce n'était que le baiser. Imagine
un peu ce que donnerait la suite.
- Je m'attendais à une autre réaction.
- Son corps va lâcher.
Prends-moi.
Sors de Carys. Prends mon corps.
Mais laisse-la vivre.
- Gwen...
- Je suis plus robuste qu'elle.
Je durerais plus longtemps.
Vous pourrez peut-être me sauver.
- Entendu.
- Jack !
- Ne la laisse pas faire !
- Elle l'a dit...
Elle est à l'origine de tout ça.
Allez, fais-le. Sors de son corps.
Tu crois qu'il tiendra longtemps ?
Il semble à bout de force. Pourquoi ?
J'ai peur que la batterie nous lâche.
Regardez... Il agonise.
Tu as traversé la moitié de l'univers
pour le pied ultime.
Tout ça pour mourir seul, ici.
Merci.
Encore là ?
Ils sont tous partis faire... ce
qu'ils font quand ils ne sont pas ici.
Vous êtes là depuis longtemps ?
Je voulais finir ça.
Fais-moi plaisir.
Ne laisse pas ce boulot t'envahir.
Tu as une vie. Des perspectives.
On en a besoin.
Qui êtes-vous, Jack ?
- Pardon ?
- Vous ne mourez jamais.
Vous dites que nous vivons
une époque charnière,
- que nous devons nous préparer.
- Exact.
- Comment pouvez-vous l'affirmer ?
- Serais-tu plus rassurée
en ayant les réponses ?
Qui êtes-vous ?
Que faites-vous ici ?
Rentre chez toi, Gwen Cooper.
Savoure tes lasagnes.
Embrasse ton ami.
Vis normalement.
Pour moi.
Je leur dis que ces satanés sites web...
J'ai des années d'expérience.
Je connais les routes, je les ai presque
toutes prises. Je sais m'y prendre.
Je te barbe, ou quoi ?
Pardon.
Trop triviale pour toi,
la logistique, hein ?
Allons nous coucher.
Tu as vu l'écho d'un instant
amplifié par une technologie alien.
- Un spectre...
- Vieux de 40, 45 ans.
Je l'ai vu.
Tu dois apprendre à t'en servir.
Attends !
Vous ne croiriez pas ce que j'ai vu.
- Sortez !
- À l'aide !

Owen. Gwen. A gauche dans l'allée.
tout droit, 30 mètres.
Qu'est-ce que tu vois ?
Je n'ai pas de visuel...
Juste un signal
D'origine extra-terrestre
Droite en diagonale, vers le château
Jack, tout droit, 20 mètres.
Peux-tu identifier la cible ?
J'essaie toujours d'avoir un visuel...
20 secondes avant contact.
15 secondes.
Pas d'héroïsme, nous n'avons aucune idée
de ce que nous avons en face de nous.
10 secondes.
Je l'ai !
J'ai un visuel.
Suspect mâle, portant un sweat à capuche.
Vas-y Gwen !
Allez !
Ouvre-le ! Ouvre-le !
T'es dans de sales draps, mon vieux.
Zut !
C'est toi la star, tu l'as fait !
J'étais si proche...
Non, tu l'as eu.
Je l'ai perdu, Tosh, je l'ai perdu.
Je le jure, quoi que ce soit...
Tu le tiens.
Laisse moi vérifier les caméras.
Bonjour ?
Qui es-tu ?
Peux-tu m'entendre ?
Je veux rentrer à la maison.
Personne ne sait que je suis ici.
Je suis perdu.
Reviens...
Reviens...
Je suis désolé
cette fichue porte nous a séparés.
Gwen ? Tu vas bien ?
Je viens juste de voir un fantôme.
C'est les images
de la camera de la gare.
Gwen saisit l'ado.
Elle a sa veste et il s'est enfui.
Ça vous va ?
Et maintenant ?
Jack et Owen arrivent.
Et puis, rien. Désolée.
Non. C'était aussi réel que possible.
Très réel. Je n'ai pas
seulement vu ce garçon. Je pouvais...
J'entendais ce qu'il pensait,
Je pouvais le sentir. Comme si j'étais perdue.
Une émotion intense peut survenir
dans un événement neurologique.
Hallucinations, démence...
Je n'hallucinais pas, Owen.
Et je ne suis pas sénile, bon sang.
Tu as appuyé sur le bouton qui a causé
cette apparition ?
Ouais.
Jack, s'il te plaît, non !
NON
Comme si ! C'est ce que j'ai ressentis.
Comme une apparition.
Un fantôme. Toshiko, par où on commence ?
Le gars que vous pourchassiez
J'ai des tas de cameras,
le suivre sera facile.
Tu as dit qu'il y avait un nom sur la pancarte
autour du cou du petit garçon ?
Flanagan. Tom Erasmus Flanagan.
Ce n'est pas un nom commun, ça va aider.
Fais une vérification complète. Naissances, mariages,
décès, casier judiciaire, passeports.
Quel que soit le temps que ça prenne,
qui qu'il soit, nous le trouverons.
Je l'ai trouvé.
Flanagan, Thomas Erasmus.
74 Brynaeron Terrace, Butetown.
Il est dans l'annuaire.
Salut, je suis DI Cooper, c'est DS Harper.
Pouvez-vous m'accorder quelques
minutes, s'il vous plaît ? Oui, bon.
Papa, des visiteurs. C'est la police.
Oh ! Vous m'avez finalement retrouvé !
Je suis Gwen.
Voici Owen, il me forme.
C'est de la routine - nous cherchons
le témoin d'un accident qui a eu lieu
à la gare cette nuit.
Nous étions ici, n'est-ce pas, Papa ?
La finale de Dancing Show.
Qui a gagné ?
Cette présentatrice.
Elle a des jambes jusqu'aux aisselles.
Voulez-vous une tasse de thé ?
Avec joie, merci.
Owen va vous aider. Par ici.
Elle va le souler de paroles.
Ce sera une forte partie.
Cependant, elle avait raison.
Nous étions ici cette nuit,
nous n'aurions rien pu voir.
Juste pour vérifier,
êtes-vous Tom Erasmus Flanagan?
Mon père était un Erasmus,
et son père avant lui.
Mais, ce n'est pas un accent gallois ?
Non.
Je vis ici depuis 66 ans,
mais ça sonne toujours comme un paysan.
J'ai été évacué pendant la guerre en
1941.
Les Allemands bombardaient à mort
l'East End.
Cardiff a été bombardé comme
Londres, non ?
Nous avons été emmenés à la campagne.
Ma mère m'a préparé une valise...
Ma grande sœur a écrit mon nom sur un panneau.
Ils m'ont mis
dans le train à Paddington.
Elle n'arrêtait pas de me dire
que je devais y aller, être
un bon garçon, et de ne pas pleurer,
mais toutes les deux
avaient les yeux pleins de larmes.
C'est la dernière fois que je les ai vues,
mais je ne le savais pas
à ce moment-là, bien sûr.
Je leur faisais au revoir de la main.
Quel âge aviez-vous ?
8 ans.
Vous deviezêtre totalement terrifié.
Je ne connaissais personne ici.
Et il y avait tout ce remue ménage.
J'ai gardé baissé la tête si longtemps
qu'ils m'ont oublié.
Aussi, ils m'ont laissé seuls.
Comme si c'était la fin du monde.
J'ai erré en bas dans ce tunnel,
complètement perdu.
oublié.
Cherchant quelqu'un, n'importe qui
qui me rechercherait.
Pourquoi ne sont-ils pas venus me chercher ?
Je pensais alors.
Personne ne me connaît. Je suis perdu.
Ils ont fini par y penser,
ils sont revenus me chercher.
et j'ai été pris en charge par un charmant
couple, qui n'avaient pas d'enfant.
Et, à la fin de la guerre,
je n'avais plus personne à Londres.
Aussi je suis resté ici.
Et je suis toujours là.
Vrai !
Je ne comprends pas.
Il ETAIT le garçon de la gare.
Je ne sais pas quoi dire -
J'étais bloqué dans la cuisine
avec la piplette, grâce à toi.
Donc ce que j'ai vu, c'était lui
des années auparavant ? Traînant ?
Salut. Gwen, je fais une lessive
tu as du blanc à laver ?
Je ne sais pas.
Laisses-le. Je me débrouillerais.
Non, non, non, ce n'est pas un problème.
Rappeles-moi, dans quel tiroir sont les
tablettes ? Ah, laisses tomber.
OK, vous comptez sortir ce soir ?
Je ne sais pas.
Encore ? Quoi ? Je demande juste si
comptez sortir ce soir ?
Je ne sais pas. Je peux vivre
sur mes réserves comme l'Ecureuil
mais tu ne peux même pas me dire
si tu rentres à la maison !
Et bien, le harcelement n'aide pas.
Bien.Tu me l'auras dit.
Hé, Rhys... Bon je ne vais pas rester
juste au cas où...
Daf a invité des potes
J'y serais. Faites ce que vous voulez.
Salut ?
OK !
Notre ami
avec la machine alien dans sa poche
c'est un certain Sean Harris
dit Bernie.
Et ce qu'il fait avec une machine alien
c'est ce que tout le monde se demande.
19 ans. Chefs d'accusation - cambriolage,
vol à l'étalage, cartes de crédit...
Avertissez-moi s'il le laisse tomber !
Convaincu de vol -
il volait des pneus de voitures.
Quand le propriétaire est arrivé,
il s'est fait engueuler, s'est excusé et
a commencé à les remettre.
C'est alors que la police est arrivé !
Et là - Vol à l'étalage.
Bouteille de Vodka et 3 paquets de
nouilles. Un génie du Crime(!)
Et cet objet mystérieux te mènes où ?
Extra-Terrestre bien sûr...
Super nanotechnologie,
qui fait passer la NASA pour Toys 'R' US.
Bien, tu as réduit le champ
d'investigations.
A la gare il faisait ça
quand je le tenais.
Il s'est allumé et c'est devenu fou.
Il ne le fait pas maintenant ? Non.
Et ensuite ?
L'ado, Bernie,
où vit-il ? Splott.
Splott?
Je pense que les agents immobliers
prononcent "Sploe".
Salut, je cherche Bernie,
il est là ? Vous êtes une ami.
Oui, je suis de...
Je suis sa mère.
C'est un petit con
Il ne mettra pas un pied ici tant qu'il ne
m'aura pas payé les 50 livres qu'il me doit !
Il est interdit de séjour ici.
Il m'a dit qu'il m'aurait un iPod et il l'a jamais
fait. Et il a fumé mes sèches.
Je lui pisserais pas dessus
même s'il était en feu.
Bernie Harris, le Mouron
Rouge de Splott.
Ne m'en parles pas,
donnez moi des aliens tous les jours.
Une possibilité ? Nan, j'ai eu 4 pâtisseries
pour une livre, ça tente quelqu'un ?
Si j'avais voulu des jours comme ça je
serais restée dans la police.
Nous avons essayé, Jack.
Que va t'il nous dire ? "Je l'ai acheté à
un alien au marché".
Où allons-nous ?
A la gare.
Expérience contrôlée.
Nous duplicons l'événement
originel aussi vite que possible.
On observe et analyse les résultats.
Pourquoi est-ce que je dois refaire cela ?
Quelqu'un doit le faire - des volontaires ? Ouais !
Nous ne savons pas ce que ce c'est,
ce qu'il fait. Non.
Jack, ça peut être dangereux.
je ne veux pas être prétentieux, mais je pense
que je peux trouver certains défauts dans ceci...
Je suis désolé, mais je croyais que tu
avais laissé tomber tes recherches d'un garçon
de 19 ans ce matin !
Je pensais que tu cherchais
quelque chose de plus excitant.
Une sorte de défi.
Ce porte à porte
ne nous mène jamais nulle part.
Les gars, venez ici ! Owen !
Owen!
Attends... !
C'est un petit salaud !
Ma mère avait raison,
ses yeux sont trop rapprochés !
J'ai dit, "juste une danse",
mais il avait une idée derrière la tête.
Je ne serais pas sorti avec lui, sans mieux
le connaître !
Quel est votre nom ?
Lizzie Lewis...
Tu es méchant, Ed Morgan !
Les filles avaient dit de ne pas aller
avec toi, et elles avaient raison.
Suis-je méchant ?
Je suis un mauvais garçon ?
Tu es une grande fille maintenant, Lizzie.
Tu peux prendre tes propres décisions.
C'est pour cela que je t'aime.
Tu n'es pas comme les autres.
Tu ne suis pas le troupeau.
Tu es futée.
Cela ne te plaît pas que quelqu'un sache
comme tu es futée ?
Hein ?
Je te vois, Lizzie.
Comme tu es vraiment,
Je ne veux pas te faire du mal, je ne ...
J'ai - j'ai dit à ma mère que je rentrerais à 9 heures !
Shhhh...
S'IL TE PLAIT !
Mon Dieu, à l'aide !
A l'aide !
A l'aide ... !
Owen ? Tu vas bien ?
Elle... elle était si effrayée !
Je - je ne pouvais pas ....
Je ne pouvais pas bouger !
Je ne pouvais pas l'aider !
La première fois, c'est arrivé à Gwen.
Un garçon, à la gare.
Qui va maintenant sur ces 70 ans, bien vivant
et qui habite à Butetown.
Le deuxième fois, ça arrive à Owen.
Comme moi, tu ne l'as pas juste vu,
tu as senti des émotions
qui n'étaient pas les tiennes.
Elle était terrifiée.
Le nom de la victime était Lizzie.
Sans doute il y a 40 ou 45 ans.
Toshiko, savons-nous quelque chose
sur elle ?
Elizabeth Lewis. Lizzie. La seule enfant de
Mabel Ann Lewis, Hafod Street.
Décédée le 29 mars 1963,
Enlevée et assassinée dans
Penfro Street, sous le pont.
17 ans.
Il l'a tué.
Pas de suspect.
Elle a dit à sa mère qu'elle serait à la maison à 9 heures,
Et à propos d' Ed Morgan?
C'est comme cela qu'elle l'a appelé.
Tu es méchant, Ed Morgan
Cherches le.
C'est un nom assez courant.
Quelle est la connection ? D'où viennent-ils ?
C'est comme être hanté.
Transducteur quantique !
Regardez.
Wouah. Je tuerais pour en avoir un.
Les transducteurs convertissent l'énergie
d'une forme à l'autre.
Ils sont dans les écouteurs.
Ils convertissent les signaux en son.
Il y a en dans ce système convertissant
l'énergie quantique et l'amplifiant.
En fantôme ? Bien sûr. C'est l'émotion.
Les émotions humaines sont de l'énergie.
Tu ne peux pas seulement la voir, ou l'entendre,
mais tu peux la sentir.
Jamais vécu un sentiment de déjà vu ?
Senti quelqu'un "marcher sur votre tombe" ?
Jamais senti quelqu'un derrière vous
dans une pièce vide ?
Et bien. C'en était.
C'en est toujours. Un fantôme.
Qu'est-ce qu'on a d'autre sur
Lizzie Lewis, qu'est-ce qu'on a d'autre ?
Hum. 1963 - les enregistrements ne sont
jamais aussi détaillés.
Que disent les journaux ? Rapports de témoin,
rapport du légiste. Owen !
Que veux-tu que je trouve ?
Pour ré-ouvrir le dossier tu as besoin
de nouvelles preuves, ou de nouveaux témoins.
Je l'ai vu arriver.
Vous non ! Vous n'y étiez pas !
Tu as vu un échos pendant un moment,
amplifié par la technologie alien.
Alors dis-moi que plaider devant la cour ?
Depuis quand on s'intéresse à la cour ?
Demain nous chercherons Bernie
Harris et nous devons savoir ce qu'il
sait sur la machine fantôme.
Nous faisons notre travail et trouvons
d'où vient cette chose.
Maintenant, rentrez chez vous.
Gwen ! Reste là !
Jack?
Wouah.
Tu dois savoir comment on utilise ça.
Même si j'espère que tu n'en auras jamais besoin.
Dois-je...
Je suis désolée, c'est que... je n'ai jamais
tué même une araignées dans une baignoire.
Moi non plus, pas avec un flingue.
C'est à toi.
Vise de cette façon.
Bien.
Quittons le stand en un seul morceau, ok ?
Une seule main, pas les deux.
Tournes toi de côté vers la cible.
Regardes le long de ton épaule, au bout
de ton bras.
un ligne droite vers la cible.
Lève ton arme.
Oh, Oh, Oh !
Trop rapide.
Tout est dans la respiration.
Tiens-le fermement, pas trop fort.
Inspire.Concentres-toi.
Expire.
Serres doucement.
Wouah.
On l'a fait ensembel.
Essaie encore.
Cette fois toute seule,
et souviens-toi, inspires.
Ne le serres pas si fort.
Tiens-le et tires vers l'arrière.
Je ne l'ai pas tiré correctement.
Bien et doucement.
Un peu plus haut. Oui.
Respires d'abord et ensuite vas-y.
Tu sais comment le faire.
Deux mains ou une ? Une seule.
Wouuuah ! Wouah !
Joli travail !
Comme je l'ai dit,
j'espère que tu n'auras jamais à les utiliser.
Oui.
Mon Dieu, regardes l'heure.
Quand rentres-tu à la maison ? On dirait que
tu vis ici. Tu ne vis pas ici, non ?
Le 21e siècle est une époque charnière.
Et vous devez être prêts.
Et je déteste permuter.
Quand dors-tu ?
Jamais.
Tu ne te sens pas seul, la nuit ?
Je ferais mieux de rentrer.
Rhys va se demander où je suis.
Bonne nuit. Bonne nuit.
Bonjour ?
Salut, je suis là, Chez Daf
je joues au poker et je gagne !
Super !
Ecoutes, tu sais, hum...
J'ai, j'ai lavé tes fanfreluches ...
bien que tu as été désagréable.
Ils sont toujours dans la machine donc
tu dois les en sortir.
J'ai sorti les poubelles
mais je n'ai pas fait le ménage.
Mais y en a pas tant que ça
et tu ne l'as pas fait depuis des semaines
de toute façon. Ha, ha !
A la prochaine. Ta-ra.'
Lizzie Lewis... Tu es méchante,
Ed Morgan. Es-tu là ?
Les filles tont dit de ne pas aller avec toi
et elles avaient raison ! Suis-je si méchante ?
Li-zzie...
Suis-je un mauvais garçon ?
Lizzie Lewis... Aide-moi !
Aide-moi !
Donc, je dois rester calme,
c'est cela ?
Meilleur comportement.
Je suis un officier de police très bien entraînée,
Je te plaques au sol et
hop les menottes.
Mm-mm! Des promesses, des promesses !
Je suis fier de toi.
Rhys!
Le taxi est là, nous allons être en retard !
Je n'ai pas porté ça
depuis mon entretient à Luckley
A ta place je porterais un jean avec une chemise et
une cravate. C'est les 60 ans de maman,
Elle veut que nous soyons chics, c'est tout.
Ma fermeture éclair est cassée !
Je vais me faire virer de la
famille si je ne fais pas attention.
Qu'est-ce que tu fout ? Allez.
Tu plaisantes.
Je l'agraferai ! Tu n'approcheras pas
ce truc de mon patrimoine.
Youpi.
Daf et Karen ont eu une prise de bec.
Elle le fait dormir dans la pièce disponible.
Je n'ai pas aimé le canapé.
Ecoute, je ne t'en veux pas
de travailler tout le temps.
Je ne m'inquiète pas. Du moment que tu
veux toujours rentrer chez toi après.
Je le veux. Je suis ici.
Et tu es superbe.
Je paries que tu n'as pas étendu la lessive.
Laisses la jusqu'à
demain ? OK.
Qui est-ce ? Mr Morgan ?
Que voulez-vous ?
Et bien ? Mr Morgan.
J'ai besoin d'entrer. Qui a dit que ça sentait le
gaz ? Je ne sens rien du tout.
Il n'y a rien qui cloche. Je m'en serais apperçu
Vous ne sentez rien ?
Qu'y-a-t'il derrière cette porte ? Peut-on
aller dans le salon, Mr Morgan ?
Il n'y a rien ici.
Pas de feu de gaz, je veux dire.
Je n'en ai pas.
Il y a un chauffage électrique.
Je ne l'utilise pas souvent.
Qu'est-ce vous regardez ?
Asseyez-vous, Mr Morgan.
Qu'y-a-t'il derrière cette porte ?
Elle ne peut pas s'occuper de ses affaires.
Il y a quelque chose qui ne va pas avec elle.
Elle m'énerve. Qu'est-ce qu'elle veut ?
Vous ne trouverez rien.
C'est dans sa tête, voyez ce que je veux dire ?
Quel est votre nom ?
Depuis combien de temps
vivez-vous ici, Mr Morgan.
Des années. C'était la maison de ma mère.
Vous devez vous souvenir des voisins.
Des gens qui vivaient dans cette rue
il y a un moment.
Des gens qui vivaient... juste au coin
de la rue ?
Comme la rue Hafod ?
Comme ...
Mabel Lewis ? Elle est morte il y a
quelques années, ça vous dit rien ?
Bien sûr elle a déménagé
bien avant ça.
Elle ne pouvait pas supporter les souvenirs.
Sa fille. Son seul enfant.
Morte en 63,
Lizzie.
La petite Lizzie Lewis.
Elle aimait danser. Vous vous souvenez ?
Vous devriez.
Une jolie fillette. Les cheveux blonds, les yeux bleus.
Elle avait l'habitude de porter un imper rose.
Elle avait économisée tous ses sous pour
l'avoir.
Le dernier chic.
Elle le portait la dernière fois
que vous l'avez vue.
La dernière fois qu'on l'a vu.
Vivante.
Vous vous souvenez maintenant ?
Je sais ce qui c'est passé sous le
pont cette nuit-là.
Juste vous deux. Dans le noir.
L'eau s'écoulant du toit jusqu'au
canal.
Les cheveux de Lizzie étaient tous mouillés
par la pluie, elle avait froid et pleurait.
Je sais ce que vous avez fait, Ed Morgan.
Et maintenant, vous... vivez votre vie....
libre comme l'oiseau.
Lizzie a dit à sa mère qu'elle serait
rentrée à 9 heures.
S'il vous plaît, non, a-t-elle dit. "S'il vous plaît".
S'IL VOUS PLAIT !
Vous êtes méchant, Ed Morgan.
Les filles disaient de ne pas aller avec vous,
et elles avaient raison.
Sortez ! Sortez ! SORTEZ !
Vous pensiez que vous pourriez vous en sortir !
Vous m'obtiendez rien de moi ! Je vous l'ai
déjà dit, vous n'obtiendrez rien !
Sortez de ma maison !
Sortez de ma maison !
Bernie Harris!
Hey !
Faites attention! Désolé!
Désolé !
Allez ! Frappe-le sur la tête !
Maman, il y a un homme dans le jardin !
Il y a DEUX hommes dans le jardin !
Bernie Harris!
Qui ?
Ce n'était pas une question.
Ne me frappez pas, j'ai de l'asthme.
Je vais pas te frapper.
Je vais te tuer grave.
Pourquoi vous appellent-ils "Bernie" ?
J'ai incendié le garage de mes voisins quand
j'avais 12 ans. Pourquoi ?
J'avais une clope.
Je l'ai jetée...
Oh,C'est si mignon.
J'espère qu'il vous a apporté des fleurs.
Si c'est à propos de ces putais de clopes,
J'sais pas ce qu'il leur est arrivé.
Bien.
Il est intéressant de savoir, nous sommes
probablement les seuls à qui vous pouvez le raconter.
Moi et un pote on squattait cette
cave, sur Moira Street.
Cela appartenait à ce vieux type.
Il était ramolli du bulbe.
Toujours rempli avec ses affaires
mais on avait presque tout pris.
C'était une vieille boîte de biscuit
plein de pièces étrangères,
de pierres bizarres et ça.
Pensant que cela avait de la valeur.
J'l'ai emmené à un brocanteur.
Ouais ! On ne sais jamais.
Le pognon des greniers.
Donc j'ai ramené la boîte à la maison et
cette chose s'est mise en route.
Ça vous fait voir des choses.
Des choses réelles. Des gens réels.
J'étais sur le vieux ponton,
dans la baie.
J'ai vu cette femme, avec un paquet,
quelque chose d'enveloppé.
Il faisait nuit. Elle jetait quelque chose
dans l'eau comme en secret.
C'était étrange parce que c'était
comme si j'étais elle, d'une certaine maniére.
Elle avait peur car elle savait que ce
qu'elle faisait était mal.
J'ai su, sans le voir.
C'était son bébé, enveloppé.
Mort. Elle ne l'avait dit à personne.
Et elle s'est enfuie en courant.
Et la, j'ai réalisé que je la CONNAISSAIS.
Elle est vieille maintenant, mais elle vit dans
l'église catholique de Splott.
Aussi, je suis allé la voir.
Lui dire ce que j'avais vu.
Elle m'a donné de l'argent pour que je ne dise rien.
Vous lui avez fait du chantage ?
Elle a proposé.
J'ai vu des choses que vous ne voudriez
pas croire.
Il y a ce vieux pont sur la rue Penfro.
J'ai vu un homme... et une fille,
il y a longtemps.
Il la suivait sur le retour du bal
tout au long du canal, Ouais.
Je sais, je l'ai vu.
Il ne sait rien, n'est-ce pas ?
Ce fut fascinant de vous rencontrer.
Où allez vous ? C'est à moi !
Vous ne pouvez pas l'emporter.
J'ai des droits. Et vous ne voulez pas
l'autre moitié, alors ?
L'autre moitié.
Des morceaux de rocher. Des pièces étrangères.
Une rocher alien.
De l'argent Alien. Des débris,
délavés par les courants.
Bernie. Cette chose était en deux parties
quand vous l'avez trouvée ?
Je l'ai...
Comme quand on enfiche des Lego ensemble.
Vous l'avez séparé en deux morceaux, non ?
Allons, vous l'avez séparé.
Nous allons prendre les deux si cela ne vous
dérange pas. Allez, vous l'avez séparé.
Allez-vous m'arrêter ? Nous ne sommes
pas la police. Mais je l'ai volé.
Je sais.
Et vous allez me le voler.
Alors appelez les flics.
Ne partez pas !
Je ne l'ai utilisé qu'une fois...
... cette moitié.
De toute façon, je ne pourrais plus jamais l'utiliser?
Pourquoi pas ? Je vais mourir.
Je l'ai vu arriver, pas loin d'ici sur la route.
Je suis étendu, là, saignant et ensuite
je meurs.
Comme je suis maintenant, pas vieux.
Que voulez-vous dire ?
Allez, Gwen !
J'aurais 20 ans en juillet.
Dois-je mourir avant ? GWEN !
Attendez ici, je reviens.
Jack!
Jack!
Jack, j'ai besoin de te parler.
Gwen, noooon.
Salut ?
Aide-moi, s'il te plaît.
C'est trop tard, je ne pouvais plus l'arrêter.
Arrêter quoi ? Il est mort.
Owen avait un couteau.
Il voulait le tuer.
Owen ? Oh mon Dieu, je pouvais pas l'arrêter !
Aide-moi !
Bon Dieu, Gwen,
à quoi pensais-tu ?
Je ne l'ai pas vu.
Je n'ai vu personne en dehors de moi.
J'ai juste dit son nom. Owen.
Bernie a dit qu'il s'est vu lui-même,
mort dans cette rue.
Tu as vu Owen avec le couteau.
Mais je ne le tenais pas.
Mes mains étaient couvertes de sang.
C'était dans le futur,
un des nombreux futurs possibles.
Quoi que tu aies vu, et que Bernie ait vu,
cela peut ne pas arriver.
Peut ne pas arriver ?
Ne peut on pas savoir ?
Tu as tout ce bazar, ces trucs alien - n'y a-t'il
rien qui puisse aider ?
Je suis désolé.
J'aurais préféré que nous ne l'ayons jamais trouvé.
Pauvre Bernie. Qui s'est vu mort.
Il se pourrait qu'il ne le soit pas.
Futurs possibles.
Il aimerait sans doute le savoir.
Ce serait certainement plus confortable !
Je ne sais pas quoi faire.
J'ai trouvé ton Ed Morgan un peu plus tôt -
je l'ai pisté.
Je l'ai trouvé aussi. Dans l'annuaire.
Ça m'a pris toute la nuit.
Mais je l'ai trouvé.
Il lui a fait une visite ce matin,
il lui a peur.
Qu'as-tu trouvé ?
Son dossier médical.
Il est claustrophobe, paranoïaque,
dépressif, plusieurs tentatives de
suicide.
Il est à peine sorti de chez lui ces dernières années.
Ecoute Owen, si Jack s'en aperçois
Eh bien, il ne s'en apercevra pas, n'est-ce pas ?
Allo ?
Je crois qu'il pensait que je voulais de l'argent.
Il n'arrêtait pas de dire : "Vous n'aurez rien
du tout de moi". Paranoïa. Ouais...
Il a dit : "Vous n'aurez rien de moi.
Laissez-moi tranquille."
Je vous l'ai déjà dit.
dit a qui ?
Tu verras, j'ai vu des choses que
tu ne voudras pas croire.
Il y a le vieux pont,
en bas de la rue Penfro.
Il y avait un homme... et une fille, il y a
longtemps.
Il la suivait sur le retour du bal
tout au long du canal.
Bernie, c'est Gwen.
Puis-je entrer ?
Merci.
Je sais que cela a l'air fou,
mais juste parce que vous vous êtes vu...
Mort, ouais.
Cela ne veut pas dire que cela va arriver.
Mais vous ne savez pas comment l'empêcher.
Pour vous, ou pour moi.
Ça me prend la tête
ce truc.
Des choses qu'on préférerait ne pas
savoir.
Jack ?
Ed Morgan. Owen est parti en franc tireur un peu plus tôt
et lui a fait une visite.
Il voulait l'effrayer.
On dirait que cela a fonctionné.
Je pense que Bernie Harris est arrivé en premier.
Il a essayé de lui faire du chantage.
Bernie lui a fait du chantage ?
On le dirait bien. Ed pensait
qu'Owen était dans le même cas.
Es-tu chez toi ?
Non, je suis chez Bernie.
Nous venons, restes sur place.
Owen, avec moi !
Tosh, garde un œil sur les caméras de surveillance,
au cas où Bernie voudrait se sauver.
Donc vous avez vu Ed Morgan agresser cette fille
et vous avez pensé vous faire un peu
d'argent avec ça.
Diagnostiqué une sévère dépression.
Agoraphobe.
Non. Je ne le crois pas !
Jack, je suis sur les Caméras... et je regarde
Ed Morgan.'Quoi ? Où est-il ?
Il rentre dans Evelyn Street.
C'est la rue de Bernie !
Il se dirige vers l'appartement de Bernie.
Quoi, nous attendons quelqu'un ?
Où allez-vous ? Bernie, Bernie !
Jack,
mais bon sang où va t-il ?
On arrive, tu es OK?
Ouais, je voudrais, si quelqu'un pouvait
juste... me dire...
Je vais mourir. J'ai vu ce qu'il va arriver,
dans cette rue.
Bernie a dit qu'il s'est vu mort dans
cette rue ?
Gwen ?! Gwen !
Je savais que tu me trouverais finalement?
Je savais que tu viendrais pour moi.
J'ai attendu pendant des années.
Es-tu venu pour moi, aussi ?
Je le voyais dans les visages
des gens quant ils me regardaient.
Ils savaient !
J'ai essayé de la cacher, mais....
ils savaient.
Je ne suis pas sorti depuis si longtemps.
Edwin...
Petite pute.
Vous êtes toutes les mêmes !
Vous me le reprochez,
mais c'est vous qui m'avez rendu comme ça !
Edwin, pose ce couteau.
J'ai gâché ma vie à cause de vous.
Nous ne le dirons à personne, personne
d'autre ne le saura.
Restez calme.
Je n'ai rien dit. Vous ne me
reverrez jamais. Je vous le promets.
Je sais.
C'est pour ça que je suis venu.
C'est ce que vous voulez, non ?
Je l'ai !
J'ai le couteau. On est bon ?...
ON EST BON ? Ouais, ouais, c'est bon.
J'ai le couteau.
J'ai le couteau Edwin.
Tu étais si proche.
Tu étais venue pour elle, non ?
Comme pour Lizzie.
J'ai le couteau, Edwin.
Tu étais si près.
Aussi près que je le suis maintenant.
Owen avait le couteau.
Il voulait le tuer.
Pourquoi devriez-vous partir avec ?
Owen. Vous avez dit que vous étiez désolé,
que vous ne vouliez pas la blesser,
mais vous ne vous êtes pas arrêté.
Owen !
Et si je ne pouvais pas m'arrêter ? Serais-je désolé ?
Owen, NON!
Je ne sais pas.
Occupes toi de Bernie !
Personne n'est mort. Tu as arrêté le proccessus.
Tu l'as fait à temps !
Je savais que tu viendrais pour moi. Oh!
Il s'arrête !
Aide-moi.
J'étais si près, je ne pouvais pas l'arrêter !
Oh, mon Dieu !
Oh, mon Dieu !
Je ne, je ne
Je ne pouvais pas l'arrêter.
Il voulait mourir.
Il aurait trouvé un moyen, quel qu'il soit.
J'ai tout gaché, je le sais.
Mais bon...
Je ne l'ai pas tué.
Je pouvais mais je ne l'ai pas fait.
Non. Je l'ai fait.
Tosh a raison.
Cela aura pu être n'importe qui.
Et pour ça ?
Le problème quand tu vois le futur c'est que
tu ne peux pas juste t'asseoir et regarder.
On essaie de changer les choses.
De les rendre différentes.
Cela n'a pas de sens pour nous.
Tous ces fantômes.
Nous serions perdus.
Le soleil est presque levé.
Ianto. Archives Sécurisées?
Allez.
Je l'ai tué.
J'ai encore du sang sur mes mains.
Il s'est tué lui-même.
Allez, Gwen.
Regarde - le soleil se lève.
Un nouveau jour.
La ville va bientôt se réveiller.
Tous ces gens.
Toute cette énergie.
Tous ces fantômes.
On est encerclés par eux.
On ne peut pas les voir,
on ne peut pas les toucher...
... mais ils sont vraiment là.
Des millions d'ombres d'émotions humaines.
Nous devons seulement apprendre à vivre
avec eux.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Drainage de l'énergie interne.
Par l'enfer qu'est-ce que c'est ?
C'est Mal. C'est au-delà du mal.
Ça ne devrait pas être ici.
Nous avons trouvé un élément
d'une Cyber unité de conversion
pleinement chargée et fonctionnant.
Je suis mortellement sérieux !
Mon Dieu, elle est là !
Elle est toujours vivante.
Vous l'avez exécuté.
Torchwood, indépendant
du gouvernement, extérieur à la police,
sa mission :
trouver et étudier les aliens,
en vue d'armer l'humanité pour le futur.
Le 21ème siècle est une époque charnière.
Et vous devez être prêts.

OK !
Vas-y, Gwen !
Gwen, C'est pour toi, poupée !
Vas-y !
Prends lui !
arrache lui des mains ! Ouille !
Oh, Viens voir Papa !
OK ! T'as perdu la première manche, patron.
Les filles prenez vos sacs à main !
Bien sûr que c'était triché.
Totalement triché ! Ouais, continue à le
répéter, Ouais. Loser. Tchao.
Il n'a jamais vu un match de rugby en vrai !
J'ai d'autres choses
à faire avec mon temps !
Rhys connait un mec dont le cousin
bosse au Millennium Stadium.
On devrait tous aller voir
le prochain match international.
Pouvez-vous nous livrer
2 maxi Pepperoni ce soir ?
Et un grand saladier de coleslaw.
Mon patron dit que je ne
mange pas assez de légumes.
Oui, la même heure que d'habitude.
A tout à l'heure.
Content de vous revoir, sir.
On vous a attendu à l'hotel ?
Konnichiwa, Tanizaki-san.
Konnichiwa.
J'ai fait tout ce que j'ai pu.
Vraiment.
Mon Dieu !
Ce n'est pas possible !
L'un d'entre eux a survécu !
C'est Lisa.
Est-elle éveillée ?
C'est juste une réaction au médicament.
C'est la seule survivante.
Sur toute la terre.
Merci, merci beaucoup.
De me faire venir ici.
Je n'aurais jamais pensé
avoir une opportunité ...
..d'étudier ...
de travailler...
sur quelque chose comme ça.
Quelqu'un !
Dites moi, qu'est-il arrivé ?
Elle travaillait pour Torchwood Londres.
C'était la fin
de la bataille de Canary Wharf.
Les Cybermen avaient besoin de soldats rapidement.
Ils ont commencé à améliorer les corps entiers
au lieu de transplanter des cerveaux
avec la technologie terrienne.
Lisa était à mi-chemin du processus
quand les machines se sont arrêtées.
Vous l'avez trouvée ?
A l'aide !
Aidez-moi, svp!
Quelqu'un !
Je l'ai trainée.
Connaissez-vous les pourcentages ?
Les quoi ?
Certains éléments ont été augmentés.
Certains sont toujours humains.
Les capacités sensorielles, par exemple.
Sa respiration et son audition
semblent complètement cybernétique.
Mais… il y a également de la chair à nu.
Stupéfiant. Peut-être 55% d'augmentation
avec 45% en attente de complémentation.
Qu'en pensez-vous ?
Ou peut-être, peut-être 60/40.
C'est fascinant.
Pouvez-vous lui rendre son humanité ?
Vous avez modifié des éléments
d'une Cyber unité de conversion
pour la maintenir en vie ?
Comment avez-vous su quoi faire ?
Je le lui ai dit.
Je croyais que tu te reposais.
Tu devrais te reposer.
Comment est la douleur ?
Les nouvelles doses font-elles effet ?
Un petit peu.
Oh... C'est lui ?
Je l'avais promis, n'est-ce pas?
Et tu tiens toujours tes promesses.
Je voudrais lui poser
quelques questions.
Mon nom est Dr Tanizaki.
Je suis spécialiste en cybernétique.
Votre ami, M. Jones, m'a demandé…
Mon fiancé.
Oui. Il m'a demandé de venir.
Nous l'avons décidé, ensemble.
Quelques questions simples.
Quel est votre nom ?
Lisa Hallett.
Quel âge avez-vous ?
26.
Quelle est la dernière chose dont
vous vous rappelez avant de venir ici ?
Quelqu'un ! N'importe qui !
Douleur.
Je me rappelle mon corps brûlant de douleur.
Vous avez dit…
qu'il y avait un endroit
où je pourrais travailler en haut ?
Cette première étape devrait lui permettre
de respirer sans respirateur.
Une fois que son corps
fonctionnera sans assistance,
je pourrais évaluer le travail nécessaire.
Et si elle n'est pas prête
à respirer par ses propres moyens ?
Vous devez être préparé
à ce qu'elle ne survivre pas.
Parfois…
afin de sauver ce que nous aimons,
nous devons risquer de le perdre.
Elle n'est pas assez forte !
Laissez moi faire mon travail !
Et elle dit,
"Vous savez à quel point c'est difficile
"
de trouver un homme dans cette ville.
Il a un bel appartement,
tous ses cheveux, alors franchement,
une paire de défenses, je peux vivre avec !
OVNIS aperçus au-dessus de Cardigan Bay.
Sept appels au
services d'urgence.
Oh... Pouvons-nous au moins
finir nos verres?
Bien sûr.
Prenez dix secondes.
Si elle meurt par votre faute…
Ianto?
Oui, je suis ici !
Elle respire ! Ca a marché !
Pourquoi suis-je déconnectée ?
Tu es vivante !
Il t'a maintenu en vie !
Merci.
C'est seulement un début.
BIPS D'ORDINATEUR
Nous devons nous déplacer.
Rapidement !
Je vais marcher !
Tu viens à peine de te réveiller.
Tu ne peux pas.
Je veux marcher ! S'il te plaît.
Amenez-la en bas.
Je débarasse ici.
Je suis vivante.
Tout que je dit c'est que de temps en temps,
je voudrais conduire !
Et tout que je dit c'est non !
Pourquoi ?
Ecoute, j'ai déjà partagé des voitures avec des femmes
Je sais comment ça va se finir.
Il y aura une urgence,
on se précipite, je saute dans la voiture,
et qu'est-ce que je trouve ?
Le siège en mauvaise position,
le rétroviseur déréglé et
le volant dans mes genoux.
Le temps que je remette tout d'aplomb,
les aliens auront pris Newport.
Que diriez-vous d'une rotation ?
Chacun conduit un jour différent.
Nous sommes une organisation secrète,
cherchant les technologies alien
depuis une base souterraine.
Et vous voulez une rotation pour savoir qui conduit ?
C'était juste pour aider.
Dès qu'ils seront partis,
je viendrais en bas.
Tosh, contrôle les radars dans un
rayon de 50 milles autour de la baie
sur les six dernières heures.
Gwen, contrôle avec cet homme - Neil,
je crois que c'est son nom,
une voix à la Sean Connery - à la banque Jodrell.
Vois s'ils ont repérés des signaux
autour de la période des apparitions.
Owen, accèdes aux plans de vols
au dessus de Cardigan Bay, vois aussi l'armée de l'air.
au cas où ce serait simplement
une mauvaise identification.
Allez-y doucement.
Vous êtes toujours très faible.
Par là.
C'est Neil ?
C'est Gwen Cooper de Torchwood.
Je sais, nous sommes toujours
après quelque chose ? Ianto !
Ianto !
Tu pourrais nous faire ton fameux café?
Lisa!
Laissez moi partir !
Je peux vous aider.
La race humaine est faible.
Je peux vous rendre fort.
Qu'est ce qui se passe ?
Perte de puissance interne.
Quel est la cause ?
Ca doit être énorme pour aspirer
cette quantité d'énergie.
Tosh, lance un diagnostic du système.
En fait…
Nous avons eu un problème
de générateur toute la soirée.
J'étais en bas pour faire les vérification.
Quelques éléments du câblage
se sont détachés.
Je croyais l'avoir réparé.
Laisse-moi reverifier.
Très bien.
Va vérifier.
Un peu d'aide ?
C'est bon.
Vous devez couper l'alimentation !
Ah, Dieu ! Ah, mon Dieu !
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?!
Sa mise à niveau a échoué.
Était-ce un accident ?
Dis-moi que tu n'as pas fait ça !
J'ai voulu le rembourser
pour son aide.
En enlevant les
faiblesses de son humanité.
Qu'est-ce que tu as fait ?!
Tu as tué un homme innocent !
C'est bien ça.
Ce n'est pas bien !
Ils vont venir me chercher
dans une minute.
S'ils voient le corps, s'ils
découvrent ce que nous avons fait…
Je peux m'en charger
Ne t'approches pas d'eux !
Tu ne voulais pas faire ça.
Quelque chose est arrivée à ton esprit.
HUM… juste, HUM…
Un certain genre d'effet secondaire
de tout ce processus.
C'est post traumatique.
Tu ne voulais pas...
Tu as tout fichu en l'air maintenant !
Nous avons travaillé si dur
pour te garder en vie !
Et maintenant tu fais ça.
Je veux que tu restes ici.
Restes.
Ne sort pas jusqu'à ce que je te le dises.
Ceci ne doit pas se reproduire, Lisa.
Si tu blesse quelqu'un d'autre ,je..
Oui ?
Que feras tu ?
OK, le corps.
Je dois m'occuper du corps.
Je peux le faire.
C'est ma faute !
Je suis responsable de ça !
Je cacherai le corps.
Tout va bien se passer.
C'est un OVNI ? !
Tout à fait !
Crawler Arkand de loisir, première génération.
Un collector, on n'en voit plus beaucoup
dans le secteur de nos jours.
Tosh,
Envoies un message poli disant que
c'est gentil de les voir, mais s'ils pouvaient
foutre le camps de notre atmosphère
ils dérangent les gens du coin. Bon !
Ne devrions-nous pas l'appréhender ?
Enquêter ?
Oh, s'il te plaît.
Si tu interroges un Arkan
ça va te prendre un mois.
Et seulement pour la première question.
Ils sont si ennuyeux.
En outre, ils sont plus ou moins liquides,
les cellules vont être dans un état.
Et ça recommence !
Ianto, nous avons une autre dose d'
obscurité. Vous avez trouvé quelque chose ?
Ianto?
Je voudrais entendre ces
belles voyelles galloises !
L'énergie part vers la réserve
en bas du building.
Recherche de signes de chaleur humaine.
Nous avons… Deux signaux ?
Je présume qu'un est celui de Ianto…
Qui est l'autre ?
Je pense que nous sommes attaqués.
Une brèche a été ouverte dans la sécurité.
Nous passons en protocole de bataille.
C'est impossible !
Personne ne peut entrer sans déclencher
sept alarmes différentes.
Ouais, bien, il semblerait que
le système doive être amélioré.
Je vais en bas et chercher Ianto.
Je viens avec toi.
T'es d'accord ?
Maintenez vos comms ouvertes tout le temps.
En cas de doute, tirez d'abord.
La priorité est de trouver Ianto.
Je suis désolé.
Qu'est ce qu'il y a ici ?
Normalement ? Rien.
Rapport sur l'état d'avancement ?
Signes d'…
activité à l'extrémité Est
du couloir principal.
Nous perdons vos signaux de comms.
Nous entrons pour voir.
Quoi que soit cette source d'énergie,
elle interfère avec les comms.
Gwen, Owen ?
Pouvez-vous m'entendre ?
Mince ! Pouvons-nous les récupérer ?
Essai d'autres canaux. Il y a
autre chose que vous devez voir.
Je suis revenue en arrière
de quelques heures sur nos caméras
de surveillance interne.
Quelqu'un a essayé d'effacer
les images de notre système.
Là ça commence à m'énerver.
Ces personnes viennent dans ma maison,
commencent à utiliser mes affaires...
J'ai fouillé dans la mémoire du système.
Mais bon sang, qu'est-ce qui se passe ici ?!
Jack?
Tosh?
Gwen ? Owen ? Pouvez-vous m'entendre ?
Aucune comms.
Nous sommes tout seuls, maintenant.
Mais que ce passe-t-il ?
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Je ne vois pas très bien.
Mais il y a quelque chose dedans là.
Une sorte de table d'opération.
Tires les verrous.
OK ?
Ouais.
OK, un, deux…
Non ! Non, non, non, non !
Mon dieu qu'est-ce que c'est ?!
C'est mauvais.
C'est plus que mauvais!
Ca ne devrait pas être ici !
Eteins ce truc ! ETEINS !
Les niveaux reviennent à la normale !
Gwen ? Owen ? Pouvez-vous m'entendre ?
Ces choses ont anéanties
Torchwood un.
Mais elles toutes ont été détruites.
Pourquoi y en a-t'il une
dans notre foutu sous-sol ? !
Dis-moi ce que ça fait !
C'est les restes
d'une unité de conversion.
Cette machine transforme
des humains en Cybermen.
Si je n'entends pas quelque chose
dans moins de 30 seconde, je descends !
Jack, c'est Gwen.
Les comms ont lâché.
Nous sommes de retour en ligne maintenant.
Des traces de Ianto ?
Non.
Mais nous avons trouvé des éléments
d'une unité de conversion Cyber.
Sous tension et opérationnelle
Ce n'est pas le moment
de plaisanter, Owen.
Je suis mortellement sérieux !
J'sais pas pourquoi c'est ici,
ou comment c'est venu.
Mais c'est ce qui draine
notre energie.
Jack ?
Vous êtes là ?
Je veux que vous reveniez immédiatement !
Nous n'avons toujours pas trouvé…
Jack, incursion code zéro. Répétez !
Incursion code zéro.
Nous sommes attaqués.
Si vous n'avez pas des nouvelles de moi dans
15 minutes, engagez la procédure
d'arrêt total et
mettez-vous en sécurité.
Mais je ne peux pas vous abandonner !
S'il y a un Cyberman dans
ce bâtiment, nous aurons besoin
d'une dernière ligne de défense.
Assures-toi qu'il ne
sortes pas à l'exterieur.
Quoi que vous… qui vous soyez…
Je ne vous veux aucun mal.
Mais si tu t'approches, je tirerai.
Laisses-moi !
Ne luttes pas.
Vous serez comme moi.
Jetez vos armes par terre, levez les mains
et tournez-vous vers moi.
Vous êtes une femme !
Owen ! JACK !
Elle ne sait pas ce qu'elle fait !
Vous combattez la mauvaise personne !
Sortez-moi d'ici, quelqu'un, s'il vous plaît !
Eteins-la !
J'essaye !
Elle a changé tous les circuits !
Coupes l'alimentation partout !
Toshiko, coupes l'alimentation dans toute la base !
Je fais cela, la base sera déconnectée !
Nous serons emprisonnés.
Fais-le, c'est tout !
Eteins-la !
Gwen ? Je vais bien. Je vais bien, je vais bien.
Sorte de.
Jack, s'il te plaît, sors-moi d'ici !
C'est on.
Où est-elle ? Où est-elle allée ?
Dites-moi que vous l'avez eue !
Fais le guet près de la porte.
Je suis désolé.
Je suis vraiment désolé.
Pour quoi ?
Allons, sortons d'ici.
La voie est libre ? La voie est libre.
Ah, Dieu, elle est là.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle est ?
Une certaine forme de Cyberman.
Ils sont nous, améliorés.
Des humains sans émotion,
créés sur un monde parallèle et
censément détruits sur celui-ci.
Qu'allons-nous faire ?
Je ne sais pas.
Elle est partie.
Ramenez-nous à l'escalier.
Jack, que fais-tu ?
Résister à l'envie de tirer.
Tosh, prends tout ce que tu peux dans à
l'armurerie. Aussi vite que tu peux.
C'est fermé à clef, il n'y a
aucune ouverture manuelle.
Ouvre l'armurerie !
A genoux ! Mains sur la tête !
Jack, pour l'amour de Dieu ! Que fais-tu ?!
Je t'ai donné un ordre.
Gwen, aides-la !
Tu as vu cette chose en bas ?
Je l'y ai amenée.
Tu as caché un Cyberman
dans Torchwood?!
Et tu ne nous l'as pas dit ?
Que nous caches-tu d'autre ?
Quelle attention.
Je nettoies votre merde.
Pas de question,
et c'est ce que tu veux.
C'est quand la dernière fois que
vous avez posé une question sur ma vie ?
Son nom est Lisa.
C'est ma petite-amie.
Pourquoi pas tu ne nous a rien dit ?
Nous pourrions pu t'aider.
Torchwood existe pour détruire
les menaces extra-terrestres.
Pourquoi est-ce que je vous parlerais d'elle ?
Une peu de loyauté, peut-être ?
Ma loyauté va à elle !
Elle a travaillé pour Torchwood.
Elle a été prise dans la bataille.
Je le dois à Lisa…
NOUS le lui devons…
de trouver un traitement.
Ianto, tu dois me croire.
Il n'y a aucun traitement.
Il n'y en aura jamais.
Ceux qui ont été convertis le restent.
Ta petite-amie
ne fera pas exception.
Tu ne peux pas en être sûr.
Regardez, vous devez savoir
ce qu'il se passe ici.
Puisque c'est là où ces choses
ont commencé. Petites décisions
qui devriendront une boucherie de masse.
Ces créatures retombent sur leurs pattes
en exploitant la faiblesse humaine.
Alors elles prennent une base.
Elles reconstruisent leurs forces. Et avant
ne vous en rendiez compte, la race Cyber
se répand partout dans l'univers,
effaçant des mondes,
assimilant des populations.
Tout cela en raison de
minuscules commencements comme ici.
Nous devons l'arrêter… ensemble !
Vous ne m'écoutez pas !
La conversion n'a été jamais accomplie !
Elle a déjà essayé de tuer Gwen !
Tu penses qu'elle va s'arrêter là ?
Elle a atteind le point de non retour !
Je ne … l'abandonnerais pas.
Je l'aime.
Peux-tu comprendre cela, Jack ?
N'as-tu jamais aimé quelqu'un ?
Tu dois choisir
ton camps, maintenant.
Parce que si tu ne le fais pas maintenant…
tu ne le feras pas de
ton vivant.
Il n'y a aucune arme qui pourrait
l'arrêter.
Ca va prendre six heures pour
l'électricité revienne.
Laisses-moi lui parler.
Je peux encore la sauver.
Nous sauver tous.
Elle n'est pas un monstre.
Ianto!
Lisa...
C'est moi.
Tu ne peux juste le laisser y aller…
Shut !
L'armée sera reconstruite d'ici.
Ce bâtiment convient.
Qui êtes-vous ?
humains 2.0
Non ! Lisa...
Alors pourquoi ressembles-tu
aux humains 1.0
Je ne comprends pas.
Regardes-toi. Vas-y.
Souviens-toi Lisa.
Souviens-toi qui tu es.
La mise à niveau est inachevée.
Tu es toujours humaine.
Je suis…
dégoûtante.
J'ai…
Je suis…
une erreur.
Nous pouvons t'aider.
Je dois recommencer.
Mettre à niveau correctement.
Pour l'amour de Dieu !
T'es-tu entendu ?
Lisa, s'il te plaît.
Je t'ai amené ici pour te guérir.
Pour que nous soyons ensemble.
Ensemble. Oui.
Greffes mon cerveau dans ton corps.
Nous deux… ensemble.
Fusionnés.
Nous serons une personne complète.
Ce n'est pas cela l'amour ?
Non.
Alors nous ne sommes pas compatibles.
Argh!
Manœuvres code neuf. Allez !
Gwen! Gwen! Sors de là !
Lisa! Qu'attends-tu ?
Cours. Nous courrons tous.
Elle nous poursuit.
Comme c'est surprenant !
Tu ne pourrais pas te rendre utile !
Utile ! Je vous ai aidés à vous échapper !
Taisez-vous, tous les deux !
OK, maintenant,
c'est un combat à mort.
Faisons tout ce qu'il faut
pour la détruire.
Oubliez ce que Ianto a dit.
Cette chose n'est pas humaine. C'est clair ?
Ouais, ouais.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Quelque chose que Suzie a trouvé l'an dernier.
Elle pensais qu'il pouvait ouvrir
n'importe quelle serrure en 45 secondes.
Je veux que vous sortiez par la porte
en haut des escaliers de secours
vers la reception.
Elle n'ouvrira jamais cette porte
sans courant ! Elle pèse une tonne !
Quoi qu'il en soit, je ne te laisse pas ici !
Faites ce que je dis ! Tous !
Une fois dans la réception…
le panneau à côté du bureau,
tirez-le.
Prenez le circuit 357 du système principal
et connectez-le à ça.
Il devrait y avoir assez de puissance
là-dedans pour ce dont nous avons besoin.
Une fois que le circuit principal est alimenté,
sortez. On se retrouve à la Water Tower.
Allez ! Vous deux… trouvez n'importe quoi
qui ressemble à une arme.
La salle d'autopsie. Il devrait y avoir des outils
tranchants… Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Te faire gagner du temps. Allez !
Hé ! Lisa !
C'est Lisa, n'est-ce pas?
Vous vous étiez cachés dans mon sous-sol.
C'est EXACT.
Détournant mon courant
Je peux vivre avec …
Mais maintenant vous commencez à blesser mes
amis. Ceci va s'arrêter !
Allons !
Ce bâtiment est à moi maintenant.
Vous serez tous supprimés…
Je suis désolé pour ce qu'ils vous ont fait.
Mais ça s'arrête ici.
Comment a-t-il survécu cela ?
Est-ce que c'est tout ce que tu peux faire ?
Je ne suis pas aussi facilement supprimable.
Nous ne pouvons pas l'aider.
Merde !
Y a-t-il une autre sortie ?
Non !
Nous sommes emprisonnés ? !
Entres !
Jamais !
Allonges-toi sur moi et on tiendra tous les deux.
Je ne m'allongerai pas sur toi !
Je ne dis pas que c'est une idée brillante,
mais c'est la seule que nous ayons !
Que faisons-nous ?
Chut!
Où est-il ?
Vite, svp ! Eteins le !
Eteins-le !
Salut, amour,
c'est l'homme de tes rêves !
J'ai pris quelques bières avec
Daf et on va aller se manger un curry,
peux-tu enregister "On a Echangé Nos Mamans" ?
Ne la touchez pas !
Est-ce que c'était bon sang ?
Quoi ?
Me rouler des pelles !
Le dernier baiser du condamné !
Un peu embarassant
vu qu'on a pas été tués.
Quoi ?!
Ce n'est pas comme si je te draguais.
J'étais sur toi.
Je pouvais sentir la bosse dans ton pantalon.
Ouais, bien,
tu ne t'es pas trop défendue ?
C'était tuer ou être tuer.
Owen a raison. Il n'y avait pas de choix.
Ianto, bouges ! Sors de là !
SORS DE LA J'AI DIT ! BOUGES ! BOUGES !
Tu devrais être mort.
Je suis du genre têtu.
Restes derrière moi.
357, 357, allez !
C'est ça. Restez derrière.
Ceci te donnera au moins une brûlure d'estomac.
Le courant va s'épuiser.
Je peux attendre.
Jack, aides-la.
Donnes-lui une chance de se rendre…
As-tu vu ce qu'elle a fait ?
Gardons-la en cellule !
Nous devons inverser le processus !
Je te l'ai dit !
C'est trop tard !
Retenez-le !
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Ne poses pas de questions, contentes-toi
de l'emmener et de le retenir !
C'est quoi ce truc ?
Une sorte de sauce barbecue.
Ca l'aide à identifier sa nourriture.
Aide quoi à identifier sa nourriture ? !
Je suis désolé.
Vous allez la tuer !
Laissez-moi y aller ! Laissez-moi l'aider !
Oui !
Tenez-le bien !
NON !
Rappellez-le ! Vous pouvez le faire !
Ayez un peu de compassion !
NO-O-ON !
Ca a marché !
Qu'est il arrivé à… ?
Non.
Vous auriez pu la sauver !
Argh !
Vous êtes pire que tout ce qui
est enfermé là en bas !
Un jour,
J'aurai la possibilité de vous sauver…
et je vous observerai souffrir et mourir.
C'était la seule chose
qui pouvait l'arrêter !
Ecoutez, quand j'étais à la réception,
j'ai déclenché la minuterie du verrouillage.
Le courant devrait revenir sous peu.
Nous pouvons y retourner.
Ianto!
Pizza!
Ianto?
Bon sang !
Ianto?
Vous les voulez ou pas ?
Ianto! Stop!
Elle ne peut pas avoir survécu cette attaque.
J'ai pris une initiative ! Je suis désolé !
Quand je voudrais que tu penses par
toi-même, je te le dirai.
Peut-être que si tu m'avais dit
ton plan, je ne l'aurais pas fait !
Ianto, ne sois pas stupide !
Je n'ai plus rien à perdre.
On a toujours quelque chose à perdre.
J'y retourne pour la sauver.
Celui essaye de m'arrêter, je l'abats.
Ianto, pose ce pistolet…
Quant on fait une menace comme ça,
on doit se préparer
à aller jusqu'au bout.
Alors, tu me désobéis maintenant…
Je vais vraiment t'abattre.
Laisse-moi !
Tu veux retourner là-dedans ?
Tu vas y aller pour finir le travail.
Si elle est encore vivante,
tu l'exécutes.
Je ne peux pas
Tu nous l'as amené.
Tu l'as cachée.
Tu t'es caché de nous.
Maintenant il est temps pour toi
d'agir en membre de l'équipe.
Jack...
La fille que tu as aimée est morte.
Ta loyauté est envers nous maintenant.
Tu ne peux pas me commander faire cela.
Tu l'exécutes ou
je vous exécuterai tous les deux !
Je ne la ferai pas.
Tu ne peux pas me forcer
Tu aimes penser que tu es un héros.
Mais tu es
le plus grand monstre de tous.
Je te donne dix minutes.
Puis nous entrons.
Prends-le.
Comment pouvez-vous lui demander… ?
Je n'ai pas besoin de votre avis !
Lisa!
Ianto...
Ianto, C'est moi. C'est Lisa.
Je suis à nouveau humaine.
Tu as lutté si fort pour moi, je devais
m'accrocher pour toi, alors j'ai pris
ce corps et tranplanté le cerveau.
Tu n'es pas Lisa.
Tu as toujours dit que tu ne
m'aimais pas pour mon apparence.
La dernière fois que tu l'as dit
c'était un samedi.
Nous étions ensemble.
Tu as fait des toasts au fromage, et tu t'es
plaint que je n'avais pas détartré ma bouilloire.
Cette nuit, nous campions
sur une plage en Bretagne.
Il gelait tellement que nous avons mis
nos manteaux et partagé le sac de couchage
Quand nous nous sommes réveillés au matin,
un chien pissait sur notre tente.
Prends-moi, Ianto
J'ai besoin que tu me prennes.
J'ai besoin que tu me dises
que tout va bien.
Que fais-tu ?
Ianto, c'est moi !
Tu ne vas pas m'abattre.
J'ai fais ça pour toi !
Je suis désolé.
Je suis désolé.
Lisa!
Nous pouvons être améliorés ensemble.
Tu ne l'aurais jamais abattu.
Pas vraiment.
L'aurais-je fait ?
M'aurais-tu abattu si je m'étais
rangé à ses cotés ?
Mais tu ne l'as pas fait.
Oui mais si.
Mais tu ne l'as pas fait.
Restera-t-il ?
Toute cette déception.
Parce qu'il ne supportait
pas de vivre sans elle.
Avez-vous déjà aimé quelqu'un
à ce point .
Quand elle vous a prise, j'ai pensé,
juste pendant un moment, j'ai pensé
que peut-être tu pouvais mourir après tous.
Tu veux connaitre un secret ?
Moi aussi !
Et juste pendant une seconde là,
Je me suis senti si… vivant.
Tu plaisantes ?
C'est lui, nous devons le trouver
avant que ça n'empire.
C'est de petites filles, leurs petits
corps. Personne ne peut me blesser.
Ils protègent les leurs,
leurs élus.
Es-tu en train de dire que
nos machines ne peuvent pas les prendre ?
Rien ne le peut.
Elle était belle,
Je l'ai aimé dès que je l'ai vue.
C'est devenu fou.
Non !
Ceci signifie que ces créatures
peuvent envahir ma vie chaques fois qu'elles
le veulent et moi suis effrayé, Jack.
Pour la sauvegarde du monde
c'est notre seule chance !

Je retourne au mĻme endroit.
J'espĶre qu'elles sont ici.
Je dois me dķplacer en faisant attention.
Je ne veux pas les effrayer.
Eh bienģ
Elles sont ! Elles sont ici !
Mes petites chķries !
Vous ne devriez pas Ļtre ici.
Vous non plus.
Qu'avez-vous trouvķ ?
Les relevķs mķtķo sont ķtranges.
Tu n'as pas vu l'heure qu'il ķtait ?
J'ķtais au tķlķphone, non ?
Et bien, dois-je appeler l'ķcole ?
Ne sois pas stupide.
Il ne lui est rien arrivķ.
Oh !
Qui est-ce qui te ramĶnes, Jasmine ?
Roy.
Ta maman m'a demandķe de te chercherģ
car elle est un peu en retard.
J'ai promis Ó ta maman que je viendrais te
chercher, alors montes dans la voiture.
Tu m'as entendu ?
Pars au loin ¶ enfant d'humain !
Ah !
Pars au loinģ Pars au loinģ.
Que faisons-nous ici exactement ?
J'ai eu une invitation
d'une vieille amie.
Nous y sommes.
Des fķes ? Vous plaisantez ?
Je suppose que je suis une des rares
chanceuses qui a eu le droit de
voir nos petits amis.
Et cela n'a pas ķtķ une tŌche facile.
On doit avoir
la patience d'un ange
et la foi aveugle d'un charbonnier.
Mais pour moi
l'attente en valait la peine.
C'est ma premiĶre image.
Pas trĶs claire, je sais, mais
l'anneau de pierres peut Ļtre vu
tout Ó fait distinctement.
J'y crois pas.
Chut !
Bien, malheureusement, je ne suis pas
le meilleur photographe du monde.
Mais cette petite personne
est presque visible.
J'ķtais si chanceuse de les avoir vues,
tķmoin privilķgiķ de ce
moment si magique.
Parce que les fķes sont timides, vous voyez.
Mais je sais dans mon coeur qu'elles sont
des crķatures amicales et affectueuses.
Merci.
Erreur.
Elle se trompe encore.
Estelle, quand as-tu pris ces derniers clichķs ?
Il y a deux nuits.
O∙ ?
Au bois de Roundstone.
Pas loin d'ici.
C'est bon de te revoir, Jack.
Ah, regardez, c'est le bois, lÓ.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Jack et moi avons toujours ķtķ
en dķsaccord au sujet des fķes.
Je vois seulement les bonnes.
Il voit toujours le mal.
Elle sont toutes mauvaises.
Non. Je refuse de croire cela.
Je suppose que le bien d'une personne
peut Ļtre le mal de quelqu'un d'autre.
C'est ce que son pĶre avait l'habitude de dire.
Ah, Jack, si seulement tu les avais
vues lÓ dans le bois.
Elles ķtaient heureuses. Elles dansaient.
Leur lumiĶres des fķes brillaient.
As-tu plus de photos ?
Oui, Ó la maison.
Bien.
Je dois toutes les voir.
Quelque chose ne va pas, mon vieux ?
Dķsolķ.
Ouais, et bien, bon sang regardez o∙
vous allez.
Vous avez eu un problĶme, l'ami ?
Oh, mon Dieu, Ó l'aide !
Aidez-moi, sil vous plaŅt !
D'accord, l'ami. On se calme.
Hķ, voulez-vous vous arrĻter ?
Je vous demande de m'aider, bon sang !
Bien, c'est ńaģ.
Vous Ļtes complķtement fou !
Non ! Non, svpģ
O∙ ķtait-elle ?
Elle marchait vers la maison toute seule.
Jas, viens ici.
Fais ce que ta mĶre dit.
Tu n'es pas mon papa.
Bon sang, fais ce qu'elle te dit.
Tu ne dois pas rentrer seule Ó la maison,
tu comprends ?  Ce n'est pas s¹r.
Tout va bien, Maman.
Personne ne peut me faire du mal.
Ah, merci, Jack.
Je vous prķsente Mo’se.
Bonjour, Mo’se.
C'est surtout des images des environs.
Allez, mon chķri,
il est temps de sortir, non ?
C'est toi.
Dķsolķ. Non, c'est mon pĶre.
Lui et Estelle ķtaient
trĶs proches autrefois.
Ils ķtaient insķparables.
Alors pourquoi ont-ils ķtķ sķparķs ?
C'ķtait la guerre, il a ķtķ envoyķ Ó l'ķtranger,
elle a ķtķ volontaire au pays.
C'est des choses qui arrivent.
Si vous le permettez, avez-vous revu le
pĶre de Jack aprĶs la guerre ?
Non. Nous avons perdu le contact. Pourquoi ?
Ne vous Ļtes-vous jamais revus tous les 3 ?
Vous, Jack et son pĶre ?
Non. Jamais.
Jack m'a contactķ il y a quelques annķes.
J'ķtais si surprise.
Il ressemble tellement Ó son pĶre.
MĻme dķmarche, mĻme sourire.
J'espĶre qu'il est encore vivant.
Il irait sur ces 90 ans maintenant.
Vous pourriez interroger Jack Ó son sujet.
Je l'ai fait, mais il ne semble pas
vouloir parler de son pĶre.
Estelle, la prochaine fois que tu vois
ces crķatures, appelles-nous
immķdiatement, compris ?
De nuit comme de jour,
peu importe, appelle-nous.
Et fait attention, c'est important pour moi.
Mais, Jack,
je n'ai pas Ó m'en inquiķter.
Fais attention. S'il te plaŅt.
Estelle ne devrait pas vivre en ville.
Elle appartient Ó la campagne.
Vous vous voyez souvent ?
On se rencontre de temps en temps.
Toutes les fois qu'elle a vu ses fķes ?
Elle les appelle des fķes.
Pas moi.
Comment les appelles-tu ?
Elles n'ont jamais vraiment
eu un nom propre.
Pourquoi pas ?
Quelque chose de l'aube du temps -
comment est-il possible
de mettre un nom lÓ-dessus ?
Parlons-nous d'aliens ?
Pire.
Comment est-ce possible ?
Puisqu'ils font partie de nous,
une partie de notre monde, et que
nous ne savons rien Ó leur sujet.
Ainsi nous feignons de savoir Ó quoi elles
ressemblent. Nous les voyons heureuses.
Nous imaginons qu'elles ont de minuscules
ailes et sont baignķes par le clair de lune.
Mais ne le sont-elles pas ?
Non.
Pensez dangereux, pensez Ó quelque chose
que vous pouvez seulement Ó moitiķ voir
comme une chimĶre,
comme quelque chose qu'on voit
du coin de l'£il avec une touche de mythe,
une partie de monde des esprits, une partie
de rķalitķ, mķlangķs ensemble.
Vieux moments et souvenirs
comme cristallisķs en lui.
Comme des dķbris en dans un anneau
planķtaire - jaillissant, tournant, tourbillonnant.
Puis allant d'arriĶre en
avant de par le temps.
Si c'est eux, nous devons les trouverģ
avant que l'enfer nous entoure.
Pourquoi ne jouerait-elle pas ailleurs ?
Elle aime jouer ici.
Les autres enfants ont des amis.
O∙ sont ses amis ?
Il doit y avoir quelque chose qui cloche en elle.
Il n'y a rien qui cloche chez elle.
Bien, quand est-ce la derniĶre fois
que tu l'as vu regarder la tķlķ ?
ou lire un livre ?
ou jouer avec une poupķe ?
Ou s'asseoir pour
discuter avec nous ?
Quand est-ce la derniĶre fois
que tu l'as entendue rire ?
Pars au loin ¶ enfant d'humain,
C'est la plus jeune fille.
Et la cousine de la fille.
Je le mets sur le compte des champignons magiques.
Ce que vous faites en privķ
n'est pas nos affaires.
Mais ces photographies ķtaient truquķes.
Conan Doyle y a cru.
Il ķtait gaga Ó cette ķpoque.
Et Houdini.
Un coup de pub.
Comment en savez-vous tellement Ó ce sujet ?
J'ai ķcrit un exposķ sur les
photos de Cottingley
quand j'ķtais Ó l'ķcole.
Et quand les filles sont devenues de vieilles dames
elles ont admis qu'elles ķtaient truquķes.
Alors, o∙ ķtait CETTE apparition ?
Dans un endroit appelķ le bois de Roundstone.
Je le connais.
Il a une ķtrange histoire.
Comment ńa ķtrange ?
Il est toujours restķ sauvage.
Dans l'Antiquitķ, il ķtait considķrķ comme
mauvais d'y marcher ou mĻme d'y
ramasser du bois.
MĻme les Romains ne s'en approchaient pas.
Je n'ai eu aucun rapport d'apparitions.
Tu n'en auras pas.
Ces choses sont invisibles au radar,
mais elles jouent des tours Ó la mķtķo,
aussi lances un programme qui cherche
des conditions mķtķo non naturelles.
Bien.
╩s-tu en train de me dire que nos
marchines ne peuvent pas les dķtecter ?
Rien ne le peut.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ? Est-ce Dieu ?
Un endroit s¹r, c'est tout ce que je veux,
seulement me mettre Ó l'abri.
On en a un juste ici.
Elles ont essayķ de me tuer !
Il parait qu'il avait des fleurs dans la bouche.
Des fleurs ?
Elles essayent de m'ķtouffer.
Nous avons vķrifiķ. Il n'y avait rien.
Elles n'ont pas voulu blesser la petite fille.
Seulement moi.
Elles veulent me blesser,
pour me tuer.
Qui veut vous blesser ?
Elles ne me lŌchent pas.
J'ai fait quelque chose de mal.
Qu'entendez-vous par quelque chose de mal ?
Si c'est Dieu, je suis dķsolķ,
Je ne peux pas m'en empĻcher !
Nom ?
Ces petites fillesģ
C'est leurs petits corps,
c'est leurs petits sourires.
Elles sont lumineuses comme des boutons d'or.
Regardez, hum, j'ai eu des ennuis
avantģ
Aidez-moi , c'est tout.
ENFERMEZ-MOI !
S'il vous plaŅt .
J'ai parlķ Ó Estelle Ó propos de votre pĶre.
Elle a dit qu'elle ne vous a jamais vu
ensemble.
Pourquoi l'aurait-elle vu ?
Elle a perdu le contact avec lui aprĶs la guerre.
Je l'ai retrouvķ beaucoup plus tard.
Oh.
Les pierres sur les photographies.
Vous savez, ce secteur entier ķtait une
forĻt dans des pķriodes primitives.
La plupart des nouveaux quartiers
ont ķtķ construits sur des pŌturages.
N'importe qui pourrait avoir fait ce cercle.
Pourquoi doutez-vous de moi ?
Je vous montre les dangers, et
vous continuez Ó chercher des explications.
C'est ce que fait la police.
Ceci  n'est pas un travail de police.
Bien, la science.
Ce n'est pas de la science.
Je sais. Vous m'avez dit.
C'est ce truc de coin-de-l'oeil.
Ahh !
Bien !
Les tigres peuvent tuer. Montres-moi le tigre.
Je t'ai entendu rire, Jas.
On aurait dit que tu parlais Ó quelqu'un.
Tu parlais toute seule, non ?
C'est bien de t'entendre rire.
J'ai pensķ que j'avais vu tout
jusqu'ici.
Nous l'avons enfermķ,
pour l'amour de Dieu, tout seul.
Il criait Ó la cantonade.
Il disait que des choses le suivaient.
Quel genre de choses ?
Des ombres, a-t-il dit.
Il ķtait sur le point de s'ķtouffer.
Il y avait quatre autres prisonniers.
Ils n'ont rien vu.
O∙ sont-ils maintenant ?
Je les ai transfķrķs.
Camķras de surveillance ?
Je m'en occupe.
Au dķbut j'ai pensķ qu'il ķtait
ivre ou un dķrangķ, ou les deux.
Bien, je veux que cet endroit soit fermķ.
Nom ?
Marquer Goodson. Travaille en ville.
Conseiller commercial.
Cause de la mort ?
Bien, d'aprĶs les micro-tŌches
d'hķmorragies sur les paupiĶres et
autour du cuir chevelu,
Je dirais insuffisance d'oxygĶne.
Mais c'est ķtrange.
Il n'y a pas de trace de doigts
sur le visage, aucune zone de pŌleur.
Rien Ó suggķrer sur la maniĶre dont
la pression a ķtķ faite ?
Non.
Pourtant il a suffoquķ seul
dans une cellule verrouillķe ?
Ūa en a tout l'air.
Attends une minute.
Je n'ai jamais vu
quoi que ce soit de pareil avant.
Moi si.
Quartzite.
La pierre de recherche.
Ah, fais circuler les ķnergies.
Pour m'aider Ó les retrouver.
Ohģ ! Ah !
Nous savons que l'homme mort
ķtait un pķdophile condamnķ,
il avait l'habitude de traŅner vers les ķcoles.
Pourquoi des pķtales dans sa bouche ?
Juste une fańon de rire de leur part.
Vous appelez ńa rire ?
C'est la fańon dont
ces crķatures aiment faire les choses.
Elles jouent Ó des jeux,
elles tourmentent et tuent.
Pourquoi ?
Comme punition
ou un avertissement Ó d'autres.
Elles protĶgent les leurs.
Les ķlues.
D'une certaine fańon, le monde des enfants
et le monde des esprits vont ensemble.
Alors comment les arrĻter ?
D'abord nous devons dķcouvrir qui
elles veulent.
Et nous ne pouvons pas les attraper.
Elles commandent les ķlķments -
le feu, l'eau, l'air que nous respirons.
Elles peuvent expulser cet air
de nos corps.
Parfois je pense que ce sont des Mara.
Mara ?
Des sortes de spectres malķfiques.
C'est de lÓ que vient
le mot cauchemar.
Elles ķtouffent les personnes
dans leur sommeil.
Oui ?
Jack, c'est moi, Estelle.
Qu'y a-t'il ?
Tu avais raison, Jack.
Elles sont mauvaises.
Elles sont venues Ó moi.
Estelle, nous arrivons.
Restes o∙ tu es, ne t'approches pas
d'elles, tu comprends ?
Oui.
Mo’se.
Ah, Dieu, Mo’se, vilain chat.
Viens, Mo’se.
Viens, chķri.
Mo’se !
Mo’seģ viens.
Viens ici, chķri. Allez, minou.
Mo’se ?
Mo’se !
Oh, non !
Oh, non !
Ohģ Oh !
Ūa n'a pas de sens.
C'est une nuit agrķable mais
la carte mķtķo indique qu'il pleut.
Ah !
Oh mon Dieu !
Ah !
Estelle ! Estelle !
Estelle !
On dirait qu'elle est morte de noyķe.
Le reste du jardin est
sec comme un os.
Ce n'ķtait pas ton pĶre
qui ķtait amoureux d'elle il  y
quelques annķes, n'est-ce pas ?
C'ķtait toi.
Nous avons fait un v£u, un jour.
Nous serions ensemble jusqu'Ó la mort.
J'ai besoin de boire.
O∙ vous Ļtes-vous rencontrķ avec Estelle ?
└ Londres Ó la salle de bal d'Astoria
quelques semaines avant Noļl.
Elle avait 17 ans
et elle ķtait belle.
Je l'ai aimķe dĶs le premier regard.
Mais rien ne durait Ó cette ķpoque.
Les promesses n'ķtaient jamais tenues.
Estelleģ
Je devrais vivre avec ńa.
Les pķtales dans la bouche de Goodson,
o∙ avez-vous vu cela avant ?
Est-ce que c'ķtait pendant la guerre ?
Non.
Bien longtemps avant.
Sur un train de troupe.
15 hommes sous ma responsabilitķ.
Tout le monde heureux.
Trop heureux.
Trop bruyants.
Puis nous avons traversķ un tunnel.
Nous avons cru que des oiseaux avaient d¹
entrer par une fenĻtre ouverte.
Alors est venu le silence.
Et quand nous sommes sortis du tunnel,
tous les 15 hommes ķtaient morts.
Ils avaient ķtķ ķtouffķs.
Mon peloton.
Les hommes dont j'ķtais responsable.
Mais pourquoi les hommes ont-ils ķtķ tuķs ?
Environ une semaine plus t¶t certains
d'entre eux ķtaient ivres.
Ils ont traversķ un village en camion,
roulķ sur une enfant, et l'ont tuķe.
Cet enfant ķtait une ķlue.
Cette fille est un cauchemar, trois heures
sans dire un mot,
juste Ó rester assise Ó bouder parce qu'elle
pensait que j'ai abimķ son agrafeuse.
Ne t'inquiĶtes pas pour ńa.
Et toi, ńa va ?
Non. En fait j'ai eu une journķe ķtrange.
Bordel de merde !
Qu'est-ce qui c'est passķ ici ?
Comment sont-ils entrķs ?
Ils ont tout sacagķ, les bŌtards !
Je te ramĶnerai directement de la maison
aprĶs l'ķcole, Jas.
Tu ne veux pas manquer la fĻte, non ?
Je prķfķrerais jouer dans le jardin.
Tu as raison.
Elle y passe trop de temps.
Ne t'inquiĶtes pas.
Je vais arrĻter tout ńa.
Mais que vas-tu faire quand ils
commenceront Ó construire
au fond du jardin ?
Ca arrivera un jour.
Tu ne veux jamais
avoir de conversation avec moi ?
Pas surprenant que ton pĶre t'ait laissķ
quand tu ķtais bķbķ.
Il a d¹ sentir ce qui allait arriver.
Qui est-ce que tu salues ?
Des amis.
Tu n'as pas d'amis.
Yeux en travers, pŌtķs en cro¹te,
attrapes le trainard, par surprise.
Jasmine ?
Est-ce que quelqu'un t'a poussķ, Jasmine ?
Oui, Mademoiselle.
Qui ?
Je ne sais pas, Mademoiselle.
Viens ici.
De toute ma vie professionnelle
je n'ai jamais ramenķ les mauvais moments
Ó la maison avec moi.
Je n'ai jamais eu Ó me sentir
menacķe dans ma propre maison.
Mais plus maintenant, parce que ceci signifie
que ces crķatures peuvent envahir ma vie
toutes les fois qu'elles en ont envie
et je suis effrayķe, Jack.
Quelles chances Estelle avait-elle ?
Quelles chances a chacun de nous?
Vous dites que ces crķatures
protķgent les leurs.
Ouais.
Vous avez mentionnķ "les ķlues".
Que sont-elles ? Combien sont-elles ?
Dites-moi, Jack !
Toutes ces prķtendues fķes ķtaient des
enfants Ó diffķrents moments du temps,
il y a des milliers d'annķes.
Venant des terres perdues.
Terres perdues ? Quoi ?
Les terres qui leur appartiennent.
Que veulent-elles exactement ?
Pourquoi sont-elles ici ?
Elles veulent ce qui est Ó elles -
le prochain ķlu.
Hķ, toi, tu as parlķ de nous ?
Non.
Si tu l'as fait. Ouais,
tu as besoin de bons coup de pied.
Prends ńa dans les dents.
Je veux une vķrification de tous
les dķcĶs inexpliquķs dans le secteur.
Quelles sont les prķvisions mķtķorologiques
pour aujourd'hui ?
Un beau jour ensoleillķ.
Ūa recommence.
Je ne comprends pas,
ńa devient fou.
Laisses ńa, allez on y va.
Tenez-vous Ó moiģ
EN RAISON DU VENT
Je n'ai jamais rien vu de tel.
C'ķtait si soudain. Puis ńaģ
s'est tout simplement arrĻtķ.
Kate, c'est cela ?
Y a-t'il eu des blessķs ?
Non.
Deux enfants ont ķtķ trĶs effrayķs,
mais ils vont bien.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Je les ai vues. Et il y avait
la petite Jasmine parmi elles.
Elle n'a pas ķtķ touchķe.
Le soleil brillait sur elle.
C'ķtaitģ comme une aura,
comme quelque chose la protķgeant.
Qui est Jasmine ?
Jasmine Pearce. C'est une de mes ķlĶves.
O∙ est-elle maintenant ?
Nous renvoyons tous les enfants chez eux.
Nous le devons.
Ouais, merci.
L'ķlue ?
Ouais.
Cela a d¹ Ļtre
effrayant Ó l'ķcole aujourd'hui.
C'ķtait amusant.
Roy a dit que tu avais vu
des amis ce matin.
Il a dit que tu les as saluķs.
Seulement Roy a dit que quand il
regardķ il n'a vu personne.
C'est parce qu'elles
ķtaient dans les arbres.
Les arbres ?
Quels arbres ?
Les arbres le long de la route.
C'est un de tes jeux, Jas ?
Ah, mon vieux, une petite biĶre ?
Mais qui sont-elles ?
Juste des amies.
Tu aurais d¹ les inviter Ó la fĻte.
Elles n'aiment pas les fĻtes.
Je ne suis pas ķtonnķ si
elles vivent dans les arbres.
Ah, elles ne vivent pas toujours dans les arbres.
Elles peuvent Ļtre n'importe o∙ et partout.
Elles peuvent mĻme Ļtre dans cette piĶce.
Dans cette piĶce ? Quand ?
Maintenant.
Ne sois pas idiote, Jas.
O∙ as-tu rencontrķ ces amies ?
Tu as bien d¹ les rencontrer quelque part.
Elles ont dit qu'elles auraient toujours un £il
sur moi, mĻme au travers du temps.
Quand ont-elles dit cela ?
J'ai oubliķ.
Ah, ouais, j'ai de grands plans pour
cet endroit, prolonger le patio
et amķnager ce jardin.
Allons, Jas, dķpĻches-toi d'amener
le plat. Les gens ont faim.
Alors, quand allez-vous
annoncer la date, Roy ?
Oh, jamais.
Je n'ai pas les moyens de la garder.
Non ! Non ! S'il vous plaŅt, non ! Nonģ
Jas, vas-t'en.
Tu ne peux pas faire ńa !
C'est mon coin ! Il est Ó moi !
J'ai dit, vas-t'en !
Oh, Jas !
Ouch !
Ah !
Sale petite garce !
C'est tout ce dont nous avions besoin.
Juste un peu de mauvais temps.
Ca passera.
O∙ est Jas ? Ah, elle est par-lÓ.
Mesdames et messieursģ
Mesdames et messieurs, puis-je
avoir votre attention, s'il vous plaŅt ?
Comme vous le savez tous, aujourd'hui
est un jour trĶs spķcial -
Lynn et moi avons ont ķtķ ensemble
pendant les cinq derniĶres annķes,
et non seulement elle est ma compagne,
mais elle est ķgalement ķtķ mon rocher
et ma meilleure amie.
Ahģ.
Maintenant nous avons le projet
d'avoir nos propres enfants.
Oh mon Dieu !
Non ! Non ! Non ! Sortez !
Non !
Roy !
Non ! Roy !
Non !
Roy ģ !
Non !
Oh, Royģ
Non !
Savez-vous que vous
marchez dans une forĻt ?
Bien, vous le savez.
Elle ressemble Ó une forĻt trĶs vieille, et
elle est magique. Je veux rester ici.
Tu peux voir cette forĻt ?
Oui.
Mais elle n'est pas ici.
C'est juste une illusion, Jasmine.
Mais si.
Tes amies jouent juste
avec toi.
La vraie forĻt peut ne jamais revenir.
Oh, elle le peut.
Quand elles m'y emmĶnent.
C'est ce qu'elles t'ont dit ?
Mais qu'en penses ta mĶre ?
Tu ne veux pas rester avec elle ?
Allez. L'enfant n'est pas s¹re.
Je suis s¹re.
Non !
Laissez-la.
Trouvez une autre ķlue.
Trop tard.
Elle nous appartient.
L'enfant appartient Ó ce monde.
Non. Elle vit pour toujours.
Jas ? O∙ est Jas ?
Si'l vous plaŅt, attendez.
Tu ne pouvais pas aller lÓ-bas.
Non ! Jas !
Non, non ! Laissez-moi y aller ! Ma fille !
Supposons que nous la faisions rester
avec nous ?
Et bien de nombreuses personnes mourraient.
T'ont-elles dit cela ?
Elles ont promis.
Pars au loin ¶ enfant d'humain !
La fois prochaine elles tueront
tout le monde Ó mon ķcole
comme elles ont tuķ Roy
et cet homme et votre amie.
Comment sais-tu ces choses ?
Si elles veulent, elles peuvent crķer
de grandes tempĻtes, des vagues en fureur,
changer le monde en glace.
Tuer chaque chose vivante.
Laissez-moi partir.
L'enfant ne sera pas blessķ ?
Jack, tu ne peux pasģ
Rķpondez-moi ! Elle ne sera pas blessķe ?
Nous vous l'avons dit. Elle vit pour toujours.
Un monde mort.
C'est ce que vous voulez ?
Qu'est-ce cela peut te faire ?
Il n'y aura plus d'autres ķlus.
Ils nous trouveront. Au dķtour du temps.
Prenez-la.
Jack, NON !
Tu m'as demandķ quelles chances
nous avons contre elles. Pour l'avenir du
monde, C'EST notre seule chance.
Merci.
Jas !
Jas !
Jas, Jasģ
Jas !
Non ! Non ! Non ! Non !
Jas !
Je suis vraiment dķsolķ.
Que pouvais-je faire d'autre ?
Pars au loin ¶ enfant d'humain,
Vers les eaux, les terres sauvages,
Avec une fķe, main dans la main,
Car le monde contient plus de pleurs
Que tu ne peux comprendre.
17 disparitions
ces cinq derniers mois.
La crevasse s'ķcarte
et elle jĶte des aliens et des dingues
partout o∙ ńa l'amuse.
O∙ est tout le monde ?
Tosh !
Ah, mon Dieu.
Vous ne pouvez pas les combattre,
ils sont trop forts.
Aidez-moi ! ArrĻtez-les ! Ah, mon Dieu.
Combien de personnes sont
descendues ici ?
Qu'est-ce qui a fait ńa, Jack ?
Ūa ne peut pas Ļtre humain.
A quel point ńa va s'ķtendre ?

<i>Je déteste la campagne.</i>
<i>C'est sale, malsain.</i>
- Et qu'est-ce qui sent comme ça ?
- De l'herbe ?
C'est dégoûtant.
17 disparitions durant les 5 derniers mois.
- La police n'a aucune piste.
- En voilà une surprise.
Sans vouloir être méchant, agent Cooper.
Les victimes ont toutes disparu
quelque part par ici.
Toutes dans un rayon de 32 km.
Autre chose les reliant ?
Aucun corps n'a encore été retrouvé.
Ces gens ont juste disparu du radar.
<i>Pas de motifs d'âge, de sexe, de race.</i>
Une minute avant ils étaient là,
la suivante...
...psss.. Disparus.
La brèche ne s'étend
pas si loin. Si ?
On n'en sait pas assez
pour en être certains.
Son activité ne fait qu'augmenter.
Oh voyons !
Les extraterrestres ne vont pas se
donner la peine de traîner par ici.
C'est probablement un de
ces clubs étranges
choisissant un endroit
commun pour se suicider.
Dieu seul sait que si je
devais m'éterniser ici,
je m'arracherais les cheveux.
Et voilà.
Attention, ils sont chaud.
T'es sûre que tu ne veux rien Tosh?
Vraiment sûre.
Un ami a attrapé une hépatite en mangeant
un burger dans un de ces stands.
Commençons par la plus
récente victime, Ellie Johnson.
Notre dernier signe d'elle
correspond à un appel téléphonique.
Elle a été coupée en pleine conversation.
La couverture réseau l'a située...
quelque part ici.
Ca m'a l'air d'un parfait
endroit pour dresser le camp.
Pardon, tu as dit camp ?
Pourquoi on va pas à l'hôtel ?
Des gens disparaissent près d'ici.
Tu veux vraiment rester dans un
endroit tenu par des étrangers ?
Parce que dormir à la belle
étoile est beaucoup plus sûr?
Aucune autre race dans
l'univers ne campe.
Célèbre ta propre unicité.
Qu'est-ce que je suis
censé faire avec ça ?
Besoin d'un coup de main
pour la monter Owen ?
Si j'avais besoin, je
ne te demanderais pas.
<i>Il manque des pièces !</i>
<i>Non. J'ai vérifié.</i>
Oh, allons ! C'est
juste une plaisanterie !
Qui est la dernière
personne que tu as emballé ?
Tu vois ! On dirait une gamine
de 8 ans. Qui dit encore "emballer" ?
Moi c'était... Rhys !
Ouais, et bien, en voilà une surprise !
Tosh à toi.
C'est facile pour toi !
Oh, Allez ! Lâche-toi !
- Owen.
- Quoi ?
- Vraiment ?
- Tosh, dans tes rêves.
3 h du mat', réveillon de Noël,
devant le Millenium Center.
En attendant un taxi. J'avais du gui.
Noël ?! T'as embrassé
personne depuis ?
Non.
Bon.
J'ai de la chance, hein ?
Alors, et toi ?
Gwen, en fait.
C'était quand ?
C'était compliqué.
Ca t'as pas pris longtemps
pour mettre les pieds sous la table.
Quoi ?
Donc c'était juste un baiser, ou...
Tosh, laisse tomber.
Jack ?
On compte les
formes de vie non-humaines ?
Oh, tu n'as pas osé !
T'es vraiment malade, Harkness !
C'est dégoûtant.
Je ne sais jamais quand il plaisante.
C'est mon tour, non ?
C'était Lisa.
Ianto, je suis désolée...
Désolée qu'elle soit morte ?
Ou de l'avoir mentionné ?
J'ai pas réfléchi.
Oublie ça.
On devrait aller
chercher du bois.
Je viens t'aider.
Tu pouvais pas garder ça pour toi ?
Pourquoi ça, tu as honte ?
T'es vraiment une merde
arrogante parfois, Owen !
C'était un bon baiser.
Il était presque parfait.
Tellement bon que tu m'évites depuis.
L'air de la campagne te fait délirer.
Il a duré combien de
temps ? 10 secondes ?
Pourtant je peux en dire
des choses de ce baiser.
Oh, comme quoi ?
Comme quoi ta vie sexuelle
n'est pas au mieux.
T'as dit quoi ?!
Tu vois le vieux Rhys fait gronder la
Terre mais il la fait pas tourner, hein ?
Tu devrais peut-être la fermer
avant que je t'en décoche une.
C'était quand la dernière fois que tu
t'es envoyée en l'air toute la nuit ?
C'est quand la dernière fois où t'as joui
si fort que tu savais plus où t'étais?
Ca n'arrive pas avec lui, hein ?
Vous vous connaissez trop bien.
Tandis que toi et moi,
on n'est pas familiers du tout.
On serait géniaux !
Et ça te fout les boules.
Quelqu'un nous observe.
A travers les arbres.
Environ 45 m au Nord.
Je les ai juste vu bouger.
- T'as ton arme ?
- Oui.
Tu couvres ta gauche.
J'irais à droite.
3...2...1.
Putain !
Comment on a pu les perdre ?
Owen.
Bon, ce n'est pas Ellie Johnson, c'est sûr.
C'est un homme d'une quarantaine
ou cinquantaine d'années.
Il n'a pas été tué ici. Pas
d'éclaboussures de sang ou signes de lutte.
Il a du être transporté
ici après sa mort.
Pourquoi ça ? C'est pas comme
s'ils avaient essayé de l'enterrer ici.
Peut être que vous les avez
dérangés et qu'ils se sont enfuis.
Peut être un avertissement.
Qui que ce soit, ils
marquent bien leur territoire.
Cause du décès ?
Impossible à dire.
La chair et les organes corporels
ont été arrachés.
Les Weevils auraient pu aller si loin ?
Non, les Weevils n'achèvent
pas leurs victimes comme ça.
- C'est la notre ?
- Ouais.
<i>J'ai compris ! J'ai
dis que j'étais désolé !</i>
Les Protocoles de
Sécurité Standard, Owen !
Oh, descends de tes
grands chevaux Tosh !
<i>Je portais cet équipement stupide.</i>
<i>Quoi, pendant tout ce temps ?</i>
<i>et après j'essayais de
monter cette foutue tente.</i>
Et ensuite... Oui,
j'ai en quelque sorte...
...oublié que je les avais
laissés là. Mais je suis désolé !
Je suis humain. J'ai foiré.
On dirait que le corps
n'était pas un avertissement.
Mais plus un leurre.
Ca voudrait dire qu'on est
observés depuis qu'on est arrivés.
Tosh, tu peux pister le signal ?
Déjà fait. J'ai pris
la liberté de le faire.
Il est à 5,5 km vers
l'ouest en ce moment.
En traçant à 140, c'est sûr.
Tu voles un bel engin comme ça, tu
roules sans t'arrêter jusqu'au matin.
En fait non. Ca fait 4
min qu'il s'est arrêté.
J'irai jusqu'à dire qu'il est garé.
Il y a un petit village à cet endroit.
A part ça, rien à 50 km à la ronde.
Je m'inquiète peut-être, mais ça
ressemble en tout point à un piège.
Ouais, je pensais
justement à la même chose.
Personne ne veut se promener ?
Pourquoi quelqu'un voudrait vivre ici ?
Est-ce que le SUV s'est déplacé ?
Pas depuis une heure maintenant.
Tosh, Ianto. Suivez le
signal, trouvez le SUV.
Owen, Gwen...
Allons voir s'il reste
des chambres à l'auberge.
Une pinte de ta meilleure
bière, chérie.
Et hum, sers-toi en une aussi.
Où sont-ils tous passés ?
- Ca va ?
- Là bas.
Ce burger revient te hanter ?
Oh mon Dieu...
Gwen !
Jack s'il te plaît... il
se passe quelque chose ici.
Allons jeter un coup
d'oeil là bas. Suis-moi.
1, 2, 3...
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Il y a un autre corps ici.
Pareil que l'autre ?
Qu'est-ce qui a fait ça Jack ?
En tout cas, ça ne
peut pas être humain.
Jusqu'où ça va aller ?
Reste concentrée.
Je devrais dîner avec Rhys là.
Qu'est-ce que je fous ici avec toi ?!
N'as tu donc jamais peur Jack ?
Hein ?
Il y a 2 autres maisons.
On ferait mieux d'y jeter un oeil.
Peu importe ce que c'était,
j'espère que tu t'es bien défendu.
C'est environ 1 km plus haut.
Au moins on a toujours ça.
Le reste de mes affaires
est dans la voiture.
C'était quoi ce bruit ?
Juste...
un renard ou
quelque chose d'autre.
- Vérifions l'arrière.
- D'accord.
On devrait continuer
dans cette direction.
Tosh !
Tosh !
Tosh !
- Fermé ?
- Fermé.
Gwen ! Gwen !
Gwen ! Gwen.
Pose ton arme à terre !
POSE TON ARME A TERRE !
Je pensais que c'était eux !
-Je pensais qu'ils revenaient me chercher!
-Tu pensais que qui revenait pour toi?
QUI ?!
<i>Gwen... Gwen !</i>
<i>Gwen.</i>
Qu'est-ce qu'il s'est passé ?
Un gosse lui a tiré
dessus au fusil à pompe.
Lève-toi, je te tiens, je te tiens.
- Vas-y, vas-y !
- J'entre.
Ok, je vérifie l'étage.
Owen ! Owen !
T'aurais jamais cru être aussi
contente de me voir, hein ?!
- Bon...
- Aide moi !
Ecoute, écoute. Je vais
jeter un oeil à ta blessure ok ?
Ne bouge pas. Retire tes
mains, retire tes mains.
Non, s'il te plaît !
- Ok.
- Non !
Ca aurait pu être pire.
Tiens ça en appuyant.
Oh mon Dieu !
Les plombs sont restés à la surface.
T'as vraiment eu de la chance, ma fille.
2 cm à gauche,
et n'importe lequel de tes organes
vitaux aurait pu...
- Quoi ?
- Rien, enfin bref.
Tu veux que je te raconte une blague
pour pas sentir la petite piqûre ?
Non, mais merci de proposer.
C'est parti.
C'est bon.
Mon Dieu !
Retirons ces plombs maintenant hein ?
Bon, il risque de rester des résidus.
Donc reste bien allongée
et pense à Torchwood.
Ca te manque d'être docteur ?
Je te demande pardon ?
Je suis toujours docteur.
Je n'ai juste plus affaire
à des patients, c'est tout.
C'est idéal.
C'est la seule chose que
j'ai toujours détestée.
Quelle beauté.
Allez, dis-le. Je suis bon.
Pas mauvais.
Pourquoi Tosh et Ianto sont si longs ?
Jack, laisse-leur une chance,
le SUV est peut-être caché.
Ou ils sont peut-être morts !
- Ben quoi, tous les autres le sont.
- Assieds-toi !
Dis nous ce qui s'est passé ici.
C'est pas humain.
Ecoutez, ma mère va se
demander ce qui se passe.
Ils m'attendent pour le week-end.
Ecoute, on va te ramener
chez toi, d'accord ?
Qu'est-ce que vous allez faire ?
Vous ne pouvez pas les vaincre.
Ils sont trop forts.
La seule chose à faire
c'est de bloquer la porte.
Non !
On va plutôt se barricader au bar.
On ne devrait pas plutôt
rejoindre Tosh et Ianto ?
Pas avant de savoir
à qui on a affaire.
Mais si c'était trop tard ?
Ce ne sont pas des enfants.
Ils savent quoi faire.
- Allons-y.
- C'est bon.
Je m'occupe d'elle.
Owen,
je veux le faire toute seule.
Ecoutez, je suis désolé pour vos amis.
Tu sais,
j'ai jamais aimé camper.
T'embêtes pas.
Ils ont pris les armes.
- C'est une pièce charmante qu'ils ont.
- A en juger par les bruits d'échos...
et la qualité de l'air, on
est bien en dessous du sol.
Des chances de sauvetage ?
Pas besoin de sauvetage.
J'ai jamais trouvé de cellule
dont je ne pouvais m'échapper.
C'était quoi ?
Je ne sais pas.
Ca s'est passé trop rapidement.
T'es inquiet ?
Un peu.
Ce corps qu'on a vu dans la forêt.
Pense pas à ça.
Regarde si tu peux pas
faire marcher cette lampe, hein ?
T'as l'habitude de
tout ça n'est-ce pas ?
Cette expression...
que vous avez tous.
Quand les choses deviennent
un peu... hors de contrôle.
Comme si vous aimiez ça.
Comme si le danger vous apaisait.
Tu veux que je m'excuse pour ça ?
Tu t'es jamais demandé combien de temps
tu survivrais avant de devenir folle,
d'être tuée, ou de perdre un être cher ?
Ca en vaut la peine.
- Pour protéger les gens.
- Et qui nous protège ?
Mon Dieu, j'ai faim.
T'aurais du le prendre ce cheeseburger.
Pas si faim que ça.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
T'as trouvé quelque chose ?
C'est juste une chaussure.
Attends, il y en a une autre.
Il y en a des douzaines.
Oh mon Dieu...
Combien de personnes
ont été enfermées ici ?
Et qu'est-ce qu'il leur est arrivé ?
C'est un réfrigérateur ?
Tosh ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est,
qu'est-ce qu'il y a dedans ?
Dis-moi !
- Ianto non.
- Je veux savoir !
Voilà pourquoi il ne
restait rien sur le corps.
Ils ont besoin de manger.
Nous sommes de la nourriture.
Donc, si on se barricade ici, qu'est
ce qu'il va advenir de Tosh et Ianto ?
Pourquoi parle-t-on encore de ça ?
Tosh et Ianto peuvent
prendre soin d'eux.
Le gamin est notre priorité et ils sont
déjà venus pour lui une fois.
Ils ne vont pas laisser tomber.
On a déjà entendu parler d'une espèce
qui arrache la chair et les organes ?
Hé, qu'est-ce que tu fais,
tu dois te reposer.
J'amasse les informations qu'on a.
Pour voir si ça peut aider.
Il faut s'attendre à ce que les
autres disparus soient morts.
- Les 17 victimes ?
- Au moins.
Ce sont des tueurs réfléchis.
Ok. Ça veut donc dire
que la brèche s'étend.
On va pouvoir buter des aliens et
des psychopathes tant qu'on veut.
Quelque chose comme ça.
Parfait. Cette discussion
me remonte le moral.
- Vous avez vu ça ?
- Quelque chose dehors ?
C'était le même ou un autre ?
Il a dit qu'ils reviendraient.
Ne sautons pas aux conclusions.
On ne sait pas qui ils sont et
quelles sont leurs intentions.
Je pense que ce n'est pas bon signe.
Ils reviennent.
Kieran, écoute ma voix,
d'accord ?
Rejoins-nous.
Kieran !
D'accord,
on avait pas vérifié le cellier.
- Vous ne pouvez pas les laisser rentrer !
- Eloigne-toi de la porte.
Les laissez pas rentrer !
Assieds-toi !
On a la situation en main !
Vous ne comprenez pas,
vous ne savez même pas
à quoi ils ressemblent.
Non, s'il vous plaît... s'il
vous plaît, non, pas moi... !
- Kieran !
- AIDEZ-MOI !
Il fait nuit noire.
Tu n'as aucun appareil de repérage !
Tu veux te faire tuer ?
Dégage de mon chemin !
Ecoute,
quoi qu'il y ait dans ce cellier, il
s'est pris 3 balles. Je l'ai entendu tomber.
Une fois qu'on saura ce que c'est,
on saura comment s'en occuper.
Fais donc ça.
Nous, on pars à la recherche
de Kieran et des autres.
- Tu es blessée.
- Et tu penses que ça va m'arrêter ?!
Sois prudente.
Vas-y.
Il doit y avoir 3 verrous.
En haut, au milieu et en bas.
Et tu sais comment trouver les
points de tension d'un verrou ?
Trouver l'endroit le plus faible ?
Taper dedans violemment ?
Bien essayé. Mais c'est renforcé.
Bouge de là !
Regarde moi, espèce d'idiot !
Je ne vais pas te faire de mal !
- Vous avez une arme.
- Je vous le promets, je vous le promets.
D'accord, d'accord,...
laisse-la respirer.
Merci.
Vous étiez blessés ?
Quand ils vous ont capturés ?
Je peux voir ?
Je suis infirmière.
D'accord.
D'accord, d'accord.
Est-ce que quelqu'un d'autre
sait que vous êtes ici ?
Vous avez réussi à appeler à l'aide ?
On n'a pas besoin d'aide.
Il y a 3 de nos amis au village.
Je ne peux pas vous aider.
Je suis désolée.
- Qu'est-ce que vous voulez dire ?
- On m'a envoyé vous chercher.
Je dois vous amener à eux.
Dites-nous ce qui se passe.
On peut aider.
Personne n'est en sécurité.
Tous les 10 ans...
...ils nous reprennent.
Qu'est-ce qui vous prend ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
La Récolte.
Non.
S'il vous plaît,
vous devez venir avec moi.
Aidez-moi.
- S'il vous plaît... aidez-moi.
- C'est vous qui nous avez attaqués ?
Je veux pas mourir, aidez-moi...
Je vous dirai tout...
Ca va vous aider pendant
un petit moment.
Maintenant parlez.
Vous devez aller chercher de l'aide.
- Je sais où vous pourrez en trouver.
- On avait un marché.
Je vous aide,
et vous me dites où ils ont
emmené le garçon
et qu'est-ce qui se
passe ici, bordel !
Vous ne savez pas ?
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Remettez-le !
Vous devez savoir quelque chose.
Il y a longtemps, j'étais
plutôt bon en tortures.
Vous savez, j'avais pas une mauvaise
réputation en tant que "nettoyeur".
Mon boulot l'exigeait
à l'époque, vous voyez.
Donc je sais...
où appliquer la plus petite force de
pression à une blessure comme la votre.
Arrêtez ça, vous allez me
tuer. S'il vous plaît ARRETEZ !!
Vous avez encore l'occasion
de me faire arrêter.
Dites-moi juste ce que
j'ai besoin de savoir.
Car dans 10 s, je vais
trouver un objet tranchant.
Ok... D'accord.
Je vous dirai tout.
Arrêtez juste.
Maintenant parle.
- T'es sûre que ça va ?
- Ouais, ça va...
Je vais bien.
Putain, c'est tout ce
dont on avait besoin.
Laisse-moi parler,
je vais me débarrasser de lui.
Qui êtes vous ?
Force Spéciales. Torchwood.
Vous en avez entendu parler ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est encore, un groupe ?
Qu'est-ce qu'elle a ?
Tu comprendrais pas, mon pote.
Quelle est cette lumière là-bas ?
La Grande Maison ?
Une sorte de mairie non officielle.
Réunion du village ce soir,
voilà pourquoi je suis là.
Rapport de maréchaussée.
Allons-y.
Où croyez-vous aller ?
A l'intérieur, s'il vous plaît.
Si vous nous aidez,
on peut arrêter tout ça.
S'il vous plaît.
Je suis désolée. Reculez.
Oh mon Dieu, cette puanteur...
Dites-nous ce que sont ces créatures.
Est-ce qu'ils nous ressemblent ?
A quoi d'autre voulez-vous qu'on ressemble ?
- Il y en a 3 autres dehors.
- C'est pas un problème.
Comment ils sont ?
Ils sont en bon état.
Les meilleurs que nous ayons
jamais eus, je pense.
Ah ouais ?
Oh, j'ai oublié de te
dire, on a eu le garçon.
Finalement.
Allez !
Je dirai rien à personne.
Qui c'est ?
De la viande.
J'ai peur que nous ne soyons
tous que de la viande.
Prépare-toi à courir.
Qu'est-ce que vous allez faire ?
Nous mettre sur des crochets à viande ?
Non,
pas encore.
Vous savez, la viande...
a d'abord besoin d'être attendrie.
Vas-y !
Vas chercher les autres !
Je sais que tu es là.
Personne ne viendra te chercher.
Fini de jouer.
Eloigne-toi d'elle ou je tire !
ELOIGNE-TOI OU JE TIRE !
On a vu la lumière de la torche.
Ils ont tué tous les villageois.
Ils mangent les corps !
Pose ton arme.
T'es pas en position de
négocier, camarade.
C'est bon, c'est bon.
Tu es sauvée.
Vous pouvez l'arrêter maintenant.
J'ai dit "Vous pouvez l'arrêter !"
Tu vas m'arrêter, hein ?
Ça serait un comble, nan ?
Mon propre oncle.
Posez votre arme,
lui faites pas de mal.
Tue-moi ce connard.
Fracasse son crâne.
- Jette ton putain de flingue à terre !
- Tire.
- Je vais tirer ! Pose ton arme !
- Presse la détente, tue.
Pourquoi tu me donnerais
pas ton arme, camarade.
Qui sont ces gens ?
- C'est notre village.
- Les villageois sont morts.
Ils sont tous impliqués.
Ils font tous ça.
C'est notre Récolte.
Seulement dans la putain de campagne !
Vous êtes malades, enfoirés.
Tu vas bien ?
Où est Ianto ?
Qu'avez vous fait de lui ?
Réveille-toi mec.
C'est l'heure d'être saigné.
Comme du veau,
ça prend beaucoup de temps.
Mais ça rend définitivement
le goût de la viande meilleur.
Bordel qu'est-ce que... ?
Oh, vraiment ?
Non Jack ! Ne fais pas ça.
Ces gens ne méritent
pas d'avertissements.
Laisse-moi l'interroger.
Je dois comprendre.
Je veux savoir pourquoi.
Sinon c'est,
c'est trop.
Ils sont blessés,
ils doivent aller à l'hôpital.
Owen, contrôle les saignements
puis appelle la police.
Jack s'il te plaît,
Donne-moi une heure avec lui.
Me dis pas que t'as pas
aussi envie de savoir.
Le village entier était impliqué.
Chaque génération.
Notre tradition.
Une fois tous les 10 ans.
On cible ceux qui voyagent par ici,
qui sont les plus aptes à disparaître.
Et vous les massacrez.
Quel genre de gens êtes-vous pour
vous lever le matin en pensant,
voilà ce que je vais faire ?
Pourquoi faites-vous ça ?
Réponds !
Explique-moi.
En quoi ça t'importe ?
J'ai vu des choses que
jamais tu ne croirais.
Mais ça, c'est la seule
chose que je ne comprends pas.
- Continue donc de t'interroger.
- Dis-moi !
- Je dois savoir pourquoi !
- Assez.
C'est l'heure de partir.
Je te dirai quelque chose...
si tu me laisses murmurer.
D'accord.
<i>Parce que ça me rend heureux.</i>
Allez, dehors...
<i>J'avais un bon boulot avant ça.</i>
<i>Dans un an ou deux, je pensais
peut être avoir un bébé,</i>
<i>je sais que Rhys ferait un bon père,
et que j'aurais pu monter en grade...</i>
<i>Enfin, tout se mettait en place.</i>
<i>Et puis je vous ai rencontrés.</i>
<i>Toutes ces choses...</i>
<i>Toutes ces choses me changent.</i>
<i>Changent comment je vois le monde.</i>
Et je ne peux les partager avec personne.
Tu peux maintenant.
Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ?
Avec ça tu peux lire les pensées
des gens, ça nous rapproche de Dieu.
Nous te trouverons.
Mon avis c'est que vous
n'êtes pas du coin.
Coucher avec une femme sur le rebond.
Ce n'est pas la première
fois que je fais ça.
Tu dois voir ça, c'est
complètement impossible.
- Dis-moi quoi faire.
- Fais-moi rentrer dans Torchwood.

Une fois, juste une, j'aimerais
rentrer dans une de ces tentes
et y trouver une fÍte.
Vous savez, ŗ boire, ŗ manger,
des gens qui dansent,
une fille en pleurs dans un coin.
- C'est alien ?
- Et comment !
Je trouve des trace d' ilmťnite,
de pyroxŤne, et mÍme de MatiŤre Sombre.
- Une idťe de ce que c'est ?
- Aucune.
«a pourrait Ítre une arme,
ou une trŤs grosse agrafeuse.
- Comment va notre ami ?
- Elle est morte.
Ouais, merci Quincy. Elle ?
- D'aprŤs la taille de son cr‚ne.
- Depuis quand sont-ils lŗ, Tosh ?
D'aprŤs la profondeur oý ils ont ťtť
trouvťs, 196 ans, 11 ŗ 11.5 mois.
La terre a ťtť perturbťe,
je peux pas Ítre plus prťcise.
Qu'est-ce qui l'a tuťe ?
L'agrafeuse ?
Nan. Tu vois ces cŰtes brisťes ?
Je pense qu'on lui a tirť dessus.
Bien, on la ramŤne au Centre
pour le dťcouvrir.
T'es lťger ! On dirait une fille.
Je suis pas lťger, je suis rÍche.
Les grosses en sont folles.
Mais je suppose que j'ai
pas besoin de te le dire.
Je suis dťsolť, mais il se peut
que ton ordinateur soit mort.
Tu plaisantes ?!
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passť ?
Ok, elle a d'abord dit que
j'ťtais pas bon en sport... Moi !
Alors j'ai dit
'Lance moi quelque chose et...'
- Je parle de l'ordinateur !
- Oh.
J'ai shootť dans la prise.
Quoi ?
Le programme de traduction
que j'ai crťť ťtait en route.
J'avais rassemblť chaque bout
de langage alien qu'on a
en les convertissant en sťquences binaire
pour voir s'il y a une origine commune.
«a c'est de la bouchťe !
Dťsolťe, c'est une blague entre nous.
Une blague stupide.
On est sensťs Ítre des professionnels.
-On a un travail ŗ faire !
-C'est vrai. T'as raison, Tosh, dťsolťe.
Tu sais quoi, Tosh ?
Des fois je me dis que mÍme
ce b‚ton dans ton cul
a un b‚ton dans le cul.
Le mec lŗ-bas m'a matťe
toute la soirťe,
je lui ai dit qu'il perdait son temps,
mais il n'ťcoute pas.
C'est pour Áa que je suis venue
te parler, car je sais comment Áa finit.
Il se prend un poing dans la figure
et je me fais bannir.
Et je le suis dťjŗ d'environ 20 bars.
Je veux pas Ítre bannie de celui-lŗ,
j'adore les olives sur les tables.
Bien, ok alors.
Cool. Laisse-moi te payer un coup.
- C'est pas la peine.
- Un whisky-coca, et Toshiko... ?
- Je vous ai pas dit mon nom.
- Ah, oui. C'est l'autre chose.
Je sais en quelque sorte qui tu es.
- Vous devez vous...
- Toshiko Sato.
Nťe ŗ Londres en 1975, dťmťnage ŗ Osaka
ŗ l'‚ge de 2 ans. Revient en 1986.
Parents dans la RAF, grand-pŤre
travaillant ŗ Bletchley Park.
TrŤs impressionnant.
La fac... blah-blah, recrutťe
par le Gouvernement ŗ 20 ans.
Recrutťe par Torchwood
il y a 3 ans.
Je t'ai vue sur le chantier ce matin.
Qu'est-ce que contenait la mallette ?
Comment savez-vous pour Torchwood ?
Il y a quelques trucs sur le net,
mais il faut vraiment creuser.
Et on collecte des bouts d'informations
par la radio de la police, et on...
- On ?
- Les chasseurs de trťsor.
Des collectionneurs.
Comme vous.
Vous Ítes combien ?
Oh, ne crois pas que c'est organisť.
C'est juste une bande disparate
d'informaticiens vivant avec leurs mŤres.
Je ne devrais pas vous parler.
Alors vas-y.
Le plus ťtonnant, c'est les
similaritťs avec notre propre culture.
Mais Áa peut Ítre horrible,
car on trouve ťnormťment d'armes,
et tu te dis
"Mon Dieu, ils font tous la guerre".
C'est pas juste un de nos traits,
mais un trait de l'existence.
Et Áa te fait perdre espoir.
Mais il y a aussi des fois...
On a trouvť cette chose,
de la taille d'une feuille A4,
avec tous ces symboles dessus.
J'ai mis environ 3 mois ŗ la traduire,
c'ťtait une lettre de
quelqu'un ŗ sa famille.
A ses enfants, pour leur dire
combien ils lui manquaient.
«a m'a fait pleurer,
car j'ai rťalisť que mÍme ŗ travers
ces distances inimaginables
les fondamentales restent
exactement les mÍmes.
Et j'ai personne ŗ qui parler de Áa.
Les gars au boulot sont
gťniaux, mais...
ils ne voient pas Áa
du mÍme úil que moi.
Je pourrais Ítre virťe...
juste pour t'avoir dit Áa.
J'ai quelque chose ŗ te montrer.
C'est un pendentif.
Mets-le.

<i>"«a les aurait fait rire."</i>
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
J'entends des voix.
<i>"Foutu Sudoku..."</i>
<i>"Foutu..."</i>
<i>"J'ai envoyť cet e-mail ?"</i>
<i>"J'ai cliquť sur 'rťpondre ŗ tous' ?"</i>
Ce sont les pensťes des gens.
<i>"Il ne me touche mÍme plus."</i>
Ce sont les pensťes des gens, Toshiko.
<i>"J'aurais dŻ coucher avec ce pŤre
cťlibataire que j'ai rencontrť."</i>
<i>"Qu'est-ce que cette asiatique a...
une crise d'ťpilepsie ?"</i>
C'est... c'est trop fort.
<i>"En tout cas, elle est mignonne.
C'est sa petite-amie ?"</i>
<i>"Marcus dit qu'il l'a fait avec
deux lesbiennes, le veinard."</i>
<i>"Je me demande comment c'est."</i>
Cet homme lŗ-bas, avec son verre...
Je l'entends.
Ok, Toshiko, tu dois te concentrer.
Je peux tous les entendre.
Concentre-toi sur ma voix,
fais taire tout le reste.
C'est trop...
Juste moi. Il n'y a plus que moi.
Tu m'entends ?
<i>"Et maintenant ?"</i>
<i>"Ok, concentre-toi seulement
sur mes pensťes."</i>
<i>"Ignore tout le reste."</i>
Il y a trop de...
<i>"Tu peux le faire. Il faut la pratique,
mais c'est ce que tu dois apprendre."</i>
<i>"Lŗ, ŗ quoi je pense ?"</i>
C'est trop dur...
<i>"Suis ma voix, ŗ quoi je pense ?"</i>
Tu penses...
<i>"Que je veux t'embrasser."</i>
- Je suis dťsolťe, c'ťtait...
- Non, c'est bon...
Parfois tu ne peux pas contrŰler...
Je sais, c'est bon.
Oý l'as-tu trouvť ?
C'est dans la famille depuis longtemps.
Je n'ai jamais vu une telle chose.
C'est incroyable.
C'est plus qu'incroyable. Avec Áa,
tu peux lire les pensťes des gens.
«a nous ťlŤve presque au rang de Dieu.
- C'est extra-terrestre ?
- Je pense.
Non, je veux que tu le gardes.
Quoi ?
- Je ne peux pas, Marie.
- S'il te plaÓt.
Je l'ai gardť trop longtemps.
Au bout d'un moment, Áa devient...
Tu en entends trop.
«a change ta faÁon de voir les gens.
Je vais devoir le montrer aux autres.
Quoi ?
Rien. Je sais que tu le feras pas.
Et tu sais Áa pour avoir lu
mon CV sur internet ?
Non, parce que je
connais le pendentif.
Et bien tu as tort.
- Je le ferai.
- Ouais, mais tu le feras pas.
Bonjour.
Ouais...
Salut, Ianto.

Tu en veux une tasse ?
Non... Áa va.
Merci, Ianto.
J'aurais dŻ me douter que tu
avais aussi mon adresse.
- Tu leur a dit ?
- Non. Je l'ai pas fait.
Qu'est-ce qui t'as fait changer d'avis ?
Tu les a ťcoutťs, non ?
Tu vois, j'te l'avais dit !
C'est incroyable, non ?
Les choses qu'on entend...
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Pourquoi tu me l'as donnť ?
- Je te l'ai dit.
- Les choses que j'ai entendues...
Ce qu'ils pensent de moi,
ce qu'ils pensent vraiment.
Mon Dieu, et ces
gens sont sensťs m'aimer !
Ils t'aiment vraiment.
Les gens sont compliquťs, ils...
Bon, j'aurais dŻ t'avertir.
C'est pas comme lire un journal intime.
Les choses que tu as entendues
sont si profondes, si personnelles,
ils ne savent mÍme pas
qu'ils les pensent.
Tu crois connaÓtre des gens, et
tout ŗ coup tu les vois pour de vrai,
une bande... de gamins enfoirťs !
Pas tous.
Pas tout le monde.
Tes pensťes n'ťtaient
pas tout ŗ fait pures.
Au moins elles ťtaient cohťrentes.
Pas de calcul. Pas de rancúur.
Ils ont pitiť de moi.
Tu n'as pas pitiť de moi.
Pourquoi j'aurais pitiť ?
Ce ŗ quoi tu penses lŗ, c'est
plutŰt graphique.
- C'ťtait pas mes pensťes.
- Quoi ?
Je ne pensais ŗ rien.
Ce n'ťtait pas moi.
«a devait Ítre tes pensťes.
Celle-lŗ, maintenant !
C'est la tienne.
Oui, c'ťtait la mienne.
Je...
J'ai vraiment l'air de
prendre mon pied.
Oui.
«a va Ítre le cas.
Tu n'as pas un seul cendrier
dans toute ta maison.
De quoi tu te sers ?
- Je crois que c'est un coquetier.
- Je vois.
Tu vas bien ?
Tu flippes un peu ?
Ton anniversaire est en juin, non ?
C'est toi l'experte.
Pourquoi tes cartes sont
encore sorties ?
- Quoi ?
-  "Avec tout mon amour, Owen".
Je suppose que c'est Owen du boulot.
Owen que j'ai vu au chantier hier.
- Owen qui est en photo sur ton frigo.
- Repose Áa.
C'est juste que je veux pas me mettre
en travers de quoi que ce soit.
Tu ne te mets en travers de rien.
Je vois.
- Tu veux en parler ?
- Pas vraiment.
C'est bon.
«a sera pas la premiŤre fois
que je suis un coup de rebond.
Tu ne l'ťtais pas, ok ?
Rien ne s'est passť,
rien ne se passera jamais.
C'est une des charmantes
choses que j'ai apprises,
gr‚ce ŗ ton foutu pendentif.
Il n'est pas seulement mauvais,
ce pendentif.
Il peut aussi faire des
choses extraordinaires.
Quel bien pourrait jamais en sortir ?
Tu dois le dťcouvrir par toi-mÍme.
Il faut que tu ailles dans un endroit
public, oý il y a de la foule.
Et qu'est-ce que je cherche ?
«a te trouvera.
J'en ai assez de ces ťnigmes.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Oý l'as tu trouvť ?
Je te l'ai dit.
Qui es-tu, Marie ?
C'est ton vrai nom, au moins ?
Ok.
Voilŗ un autre nom.
Philoctetes.
Je suis Philoctetes.

Tu me le ramŤnes pour six heures.
Vraiment six heures cette fois.
Kelly m'offre 90 minutes d'UV
comme cadeau de mariage.
En plus, tu enfreins la loi
en le ramenant en retard.
Mon pŤre dit que je pourrais
te faire arrÍter, alors penses-y.
Allez, mets tes chaussures et vas
aux toilettes. Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
-Je veux pas y aller.
-Tu n'as pas le choix.
Lawrence va arriver, et on doit
choisir les serviettes de table.
- Mais c'est nul.
- Prends tes Power Rangers, alors.
C'est Lawrence qui les lui a achetťs.
On ne l'entend plus, maintenant.
Enfin, c'est tout lui, ultra
attentionnť. Pas comme d'autres.
Oh, et pas de coca. Je veux pas
qu'il revienne surexcitť.
Je croyais que tu avais arrÍtť la pÍche.
En effet.
Oh mon Dieu, Neil,
qu'est-ce que tu fais ?!
Je repensais ŗ l'Ile de Wight.
Tu t'en rappelles ?
On avait ce chalet... ŗ peu prŤs
quand Danny a commencť ŗ marcher.
Le chalet ťtait plein d'araignťes,
et tu m'appelais ton hťros,
parce que... j'avais pas peur.
Je les attrapais et les jetais dehors.
Oh mon Dieu, Neil !
Tu me fais peur !
C'ťtait un souvenir parfait.
On ťtait heureux car on ťtait ensemble.
Et toutes ces conneries avec
Lawrence, c'est bon.
Je te pardonne.
Parce que je vois Áa avec
plus de recul maintenant.
Oh mon Dieu !
Oh mon Dieu !
Oh, non, pitiť !
C'est bon, c'est juste comme
s'endormir, c'est tout.
Ne fais pas Áa, non
Danny, s'il te plaÓt !
Et on sera ensemble pour toujours.
C'est bon.
Vous Ítes sains et saufs.
Sale flic !

ArrÍte de chanter.
Tout ce que tu veux, mais arrÍte !
Je vois pas pourquoi tu ris !
ArrÍte de chanter, chante pas
s'il te plaÓt, chante pas s'il te plaÓt.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Tu sais, le squelette du chantier ?
Et bien, Amanda Burton vient de
finir le rapport post-mortem.
Ok, je peux tout expliquer.
Sur le chantier, Owen a dit que c'ťtait
une femme tuťe par balle.
J'ťtais lŗ depuis quoi, une minute ?
Entre temps, il a dŻ revoir plusieurs
de ses conclusions initiales.
Tout d'abord, que ce n'ťtait en fait
pas une femme, mais un homme.
Un jeune homme. TrŤs fťminin.
Mais quand mÍme un homme.
Ensuite vient la cause de la mort.
Owen disait plaie par balle. Uh-UHH !
La bonne rťponse ťtait...
- Trauma non-identifiť, mais...
- Trauma non-identifiť ?
Mais plus maintenant.
On voit Áa dans les accidents routiers,
quand par exemple un poteau rentre
dans un corps ŗ grande vitesse.
- La seule cause ŗ exclure ťtait...
- Une plaie par balle.
Plaie par balle.
Y avait-il un seul ťlťment de
ton pronostic qui ťtait bon ?
Je savais que c'ťtait... un squelette.
- Oui, en effet.
- Tu viens de franchir le point de...
Oý as-tu ťtť formť ? Oý Áa ?
Est-ce que t'as ťtť formť ?
Jack,
tu t'y connais en
mythologie grecque ?
Visa de sťcuritť 45895. Harkness.
Un peu, pourquoi ?
T'as entendu parler de Philoctetes ?
C'ťtait une question dans un Bar Quiz.
T'as ťtť dans un Bar Quiz ?
Oui. Oui, j'adore les Bars Quiz.
Au... Prince des Marťes.
Philoctetes ťtait un archer,
recrutť pendant la Guerre de Troie.
Il a ťtť impliquť dans une querelle, et
exilť sur l'Óle de Lemnos pour dix ans.
Juste laissť lŗ-bas ?
Hť ! Oý en est cette liste
pour l'UNIT ?
Hmm ?
Ah, oui. J'y travaille.
Bien. C'est quand tu veux, tu sais...
Premier Ministre, cette ligne
est-elle sťcurisťe ?
Pouvez vous me dire pourquoi
les opťrations de Torchwood
font maintenant parti de votre briefing
sťcuritť sur les meneurs de l'Opposition?
C'est que...
C'est incroyable.
C'est la chose la plus incroyable
que j'ai entendue.
Ils devraient faire de toi un hťros.
Tu avais raison, pour le pendentif.
Je comprends maintenant :
il peut Ítre utilisť pour le bien.
Qu'as-tu dit au boulot ?
Comment l'as-tu expliquť ?
Je ne leur ai rien dit.
C'est plus sage.
Dťsolťe, mais je vais devoir
t'embrasser maintenant.
- Marie, non.
- Ecoute,
Tu as fait quelque chose de
vraiment courageux et sexy,
je dois t'embrasser.
C'est pas moi qui fait les rŤgles.
Alors...
Que devient ce que vous
avez trouvť sur le chantier ?
Je sais pas, mon patron s'en occupe.
Je croyais que tu t'occupais
de tous les trucs technologiques.
Oui, mais parfois nos boulots
se recoupent un peu.
Je m'occupe... d'un truc
administratif pour lui.
Tu n'as pas de secrťtaire pour Áa ?
C'est assez compliquť.
Alors, qu'est-ce qu'il a dťcouvert ?
-Je sais pas. Il n'a rien dit.
-C'est assez curieux.
Non, c'est normal.
Oui, bien sŻr, s'il te cache des
choses, il doit y avoir une raison.
Tu continues quand mÍme
pas ŗ t'en faire pour Áa ?
Ok, alors si ce n'ťtait pas un coup
de pistolet, ou de fusil,
ou de ce qu'ils avaient ŗ l'ťpoque,
peut-Ítre que c'ťtait une sorte de rituel.
Tu es magnifique.
J'ai cherchť un peu dans les cultes
dťmoniaques et tout Áa,
voir si ils parlent d'arracher des
cúurs, et tu sais quoi ? Il y a rien.
Ils mangeaient des yeux, buvaient du
sang, copulaient avec des animaux,
mais ils n'arrachaient pas de cúurs.
Evidemment, Áa aurait ťtť bizarre !
Pourquoi s'en faire autant? Celui qui a
fait Áa n'est plus un danger aujourd'hui.
Oui, je sais.
C'est juste qu'il y a quelque chose...
«a ne te rappelle rien ?
Hum..
Le moment dans Alien oý
cette chose sort de John Hurt ?
Dťsolť, j'aurai dŻ Ítre plus prťcis.
«a te rappelle quelque chose d'utile ?
- Non, dťsolťe.
- D'accord.
Retourne lŗ-bas, fait tes trucs sur
l'ordi et pense aux chaussures, hein ?
Merci.
Jack t'a dit quelque chose sur
ce qu'on a trouvť avec le corps ?
Non, pourquoi ?
<i>"Vťrifier s'il y avait des hŰpitaux
dans les environs."</i>
<i>"Peut-Ítre un patient mort pendant
une opťration. Il y a du sucre lŗ-dedans."</i>
Rien, juste comme Áa.
Salut.
<i>"Continue ŗ regarder le
squelette, la regarde pas."</i>
<i>"Tu souris..."</i>
Salut, Tosh.
Ce cafť a besoin de moi.
<i>"Qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
Pourquoi il me regarde pas ?"</i>
Il y a une copie de la dťposition
de ce Mickael Hamilton sur ton bureau.
Il voit toujours des Cybermen
devant la maison de sa mŤre.
<i>"Ne pense pas ŗ sa paume dans le bas
de ton dos, ses mains dans tes cheveux"</i>
Je crois que je vais remonter.
Ok. J'appellerai les services sociaux,
voir s'il a dťjŗ eu des troubles mentaux.
<i>"Non, Gwen, c'est bien.
«a ne peut pas continuer."</i>
<i>"C'est une bonne chose.
Pourquoi il me regarde pas, bon sang ?"</i>
Je crois que j'ai un max de boulot.
Je viens d'avoir une conversation
trŤs intťressante
avec l'Inspecteur de Police
Henderson.
Bien.
Intťressante tout d'abord parce que
cet homme avait les plus grosses
mains que j'aie jamais vu,
et ensuite...
parce qu'il m'a racontť que tu avais
empÍchť un femme et son enfant
d'Ítre assassinťs par son ex-mari.
- Oui, oui, j'allais t'en parler.
- Alors pourquoi ne l'as-tu pas fait ?
Je sais pas, Áa n'avait pas de
rapport avec le boulot,
c'ťtait juste... un truc.
Il se passe souvent des choses
qui ne sont pas liťes au boulot.
Tu fais Áa souvent ?
Tu combats secrŤtement le crime,
c'est Áa, Tosh ?
Je ne voulais pas avoir l'air
de me vanter.
L'homme qu'ils ont arrÍtť, Henderson
m'a dit que tu l'as entendu murmurer
pendant qu'il marchait, et que c'est
Áa qui t'as mis la puce ŗ l'oreille.
Au dťbut, j'arrivais pas ŗ comprendre ce
qu'il racontait, et puis "Oh mon Dieu !"
C'est curieux, car quand je m'apprÍte
ŗ tuer quelqu'un,
je fais gaffe ŗ ne pas en parler
ŗ voix haute dans la rue.
Bien sŻr, c'est la leÁon numťro 1.
Je me demandais oý tu en
ťtais avec Áa.
C'est en cours.
Tu vas le dťmonter ?
Comme je l'ai dit, c'est en cours.
Quoi ? J'ai quelque chose sur le
visage ? De la nourriture ?
Non. Dťsolťe.
J'ťtais bloquťe.
Ecoute, c'ťtait un bel acte,
Tosh. Bien jouť.
Ok, alors j'ai des chips,
du cafť : du vrai, du vin...
Je vais leur donner le pendentif.
- Bien, fais-le
- Tu as raison.
C'est pas comme lire un
journal intime.
C'est bien pire, et je me sens
sale et honteuse...
Et maintenant...
j'ai espionnť mes amis.
- Quels amis !
- Qu'est-ce que Áa veut dire ?
Ils ont pitiť de toi.
Ils t'excluent ! Ils te font
faire leur putain de paperasse !
Et ?
- Non. J'ai pris ma dťcision.
- Toshiko, ne fais pas Áa.
Ils voudront probablement te
parler, et alors ?
C'est le pendentif qui les
intťresse, pas toi.
Si je rentre lŗ-bas, je n'en
ressortirai jamais.
De quoi tu parles ?
C'est pas la Stasi !
Ecoute, je vais faire venir mon patron.
"REPOSE LE TELEPHONE"
Ok.
Je vais te montrer.
<i>"C'est pour Áa que tu
ne peux pas leur dire."</i>
Tu es froide.
Qui es-tu ?
<i>"Toujours celle que tu as embrassťe."</i>
<i>"Celle que tu as caressťe."</i>
- Dis quelque chose.
- Alors...
J'embrasse une femme et un alien.
- Lequel est le pire ?
- Je sais ce que diraient mes parents.
J'ai lu tes pensťes.
Je n'ai pas vu Áa.
Que me caches-tu d'autre ?
Tu crois qu'il peut y avoir
plus gros que Áa ?
Vous Ítes tellement libres.
Quand je suis arrivťe,
j'ai trouvť Áa obscŤne.
Mon monde ťtait sauvage.
Un culte imposť dans des temples
de la taille de villes,
des brigades d'exťcution
arpentant les rues.
N'importe quelle protestation
menait ŗ la mort,
ou ŗ la dťportation, vers ce qu'ils
appelaient un avant-poste sauvage.
- Et le pendentif ?
- C'est comme Áa que l'on communique.
On a communiquť comme Áa
pendant des siŤcles.
Parler oralement,
en utilisant des mots prť-arrangťs en
nombre dťfini, c'est tellement archaÔque.
Et plutŰt laid ŗ voir.
La machine que vous avez trouvťe
est un transporteur.
Il m'a amenťe ici, et peut
me ramener chez moi.
Il me le faut avant
que vous le dťmontiez.
- Mais tu ne seras pas en danger ?
- 200 ans se sont ťcoulťs.
Il y aura un nouveau gouvernement.
Il y aura eu 20 gouvernements
entre-temps.
Alors pourquoi personne
n'est venu te chercher ?
On m'a oubliťe.
Comme Philoctetes sur Lemnos.
Laisse-moi t'amener ŗ Torchwood.
On peut peut-Ítre t'aider,
- le rťparer, te ramener chez toi.
- Non !
Vous m'examinerez,
dťciderez si je suis utile,
ou si je suis un danger,
et m'enfermerez dans une cellule.
Comprendre les cultures aliens
ne vous intťresse pas.
C'est pour Áa que vous n'avez
pas encore la technologie
pour atteindre d'autres planŤtes.
Vous avez une ‚me d'envahisseurs.
Tu crois vraiment que je vais venir,
me rendre, les mains en l'air ?
<i>"Le silence quand j'ouvre la porte...
Je ne supporterais plus ce silence..."</i>
<i>"Ses mains ťtaient froides."</i>
<i>"Vouloir appeler les Services
Sociaux, juste pour quelques bleus ?!"</i>
<i>"Tout l'hťritage part dans le logement..."</i>
<i>"Il l'appelait le petit secret
de Grand-pŤre..."</i>
Je ne peux plus supporter Áa.
Ce poids, cette dťpravation...
Cette peur...
<i>elle m'envahit.</i>
<i>Elle est dans ma bouche,</i>
<i>dans mes cheveux,</i>
<i>dans mes yeux.</i>
Marmer...
Comme si je me noyais dans de l'encre.
Que faire... ?
EnlŤvement du coeur...
"Rapports d'autopsie donnťs
ŗ l'Opťration Lowry."
Et mÍme quand je ne porte
pas le pendentif...
mÍme quand il n'y a rien,
je ne peux pas oublier ce que j'ai vu,
ce que j'ai entendu.
EnlŤvement du coeur.
EnlŤvement du coeur. Enlevť.
Jusqu'oý Áa remonte ?
C'est comme une malťdiction,
envoyťe par les dieux pour
rendre quelqu'un fou.
<i>J'avais de l'espoir.</i>
<i>Je voyais toujours quelque chose,</i>
des petites marques de gentillesse,
et Áa me faisait penser
qu'on ťtait en sťcuritť,
<i>qu'il y avait du bon en nous.</i>
C'est impossible.
<i>Mais il n'y en a pas.</i>
C'est comme les Weevils.
<i>Tu les regardes, et il n'y a que
cet horrible geignement.</i>
C'est totalement impossible.
Tu avais raison.
Tout ce que tu as dis sur nous.
<i>On est effrayťs, et endurcis.</i>
- Owen ?
- Il faut que tu voies Áa.
Et je ne peux plus en faire partie.
<i>Je ne sais pas quoi faire.</i>
- Dis-moi quoi faire !
- Fais-moi entrer ŗ Torchwood.
<i>"A Xanadu, Kublai Khan construisit
un temple du plaisir seigneurial..."</i>
<i>"La riviŤre sacrťe Alph traversait
des cavernes immenses,"</i>
<i>"jusqu'ŗ une mer sans soleil."</i>
- Alors, oý est-il, mon ange ?
- Reste lŗ.
C'est Jack, mon patron, qui l'a.
Fais vite.
Un long voyage m'attend.
Il faudrait peut-Ítre que
je mange avant.
C'est Áa que tu cherches ?
- Jack !
- Un de mes amis,
appelons-le Vincent.
C'ťtait son nom, aprŤs tout.
Un mec normal, une petite-amie,
aimait le sport, la biŤre.
Il a commencť ŗ se
comporter... bizarrement,
un peu distrait.
Tout ŗ coup, il a disparu
pendant quelques mois.
Quand il est revenu,
on a dŻ commencer ŗ
l'appeler Vanessa.
Depuis, j'ai toujours ťtť
un peu nerveux
quand un ami ne se
comporte pas comme d'habitude.
Dťsolť, on nía pas ťtť prťsentťs.
Jack Harkness.
Je suppose que tu
n'es pas du coin.
Ca...
Áa...
Ah, c'est incroyable.
- Tu sais ce que c'est ?
- Un transporteur.
Marie ťtait prisonnier politique,
elle a ťtť exilťe ici. Ecoute, Jack...
Tu as a moitiť bon.
Marie... c'est bien Marie, non ?
Tu veux lui expliquer la
partie intťressante ? Non ?
Elle est bavarde ! Je sais pas
comment tu as rťussi ŗ la faire parler.
C'est un transporteur pour deux hommes.
Ou quoi que vous soyez.
Vous Ítes peut-Ítre des calamars,
pour ce que j'en sais.
Un transporteur pour deux calamars.
Un prisonnier, et un garde.
Tu veux nous dire ce qui est
arrivť au garde, Marie ?
Je l'ai tuť.
Mais on m'a dťrangťe.
Puis un autre est arrivť, un soldat.
<i>Il a voulu me tirer dessus.</i>
Les traÓnťes ont-elles des priŤres ?
<i>J'ai plongť ma nouvelle main humaine
dans sa poitrine, j'ai arrachť son cúur.</i>
Et c'est ce que tu continues
ŗ faire depuis.
Cette forme doit Ítre nourrie.
Toutes les blessures avaient
ŗ peu prŤs la taille d'un poing.
Mon Dieu, tous ces gens...
Tu as tuť tous ces gens.
J'ai fui avant que
d'autres soldats n'arrivent.
J'avais tellement ŗ explorer !
Et j'aimais tellement ce corps.
Si doux.
Si malfaisant. Le pouvoir qu'un tel
corps a dans ce monde.
En quelques annťes,
la forÍt avait disparu,
le transporteur ťtait enterrť
sous l'extension de la ville.
Je m'en fichais. Je n'ťtais pas
vraiment pressťe de rentrer.
Et tu n'as fait que tuer depuis.
Je savais que ma situation
finirait par se compliquer.
Mais c'ťtait bon, tant que je savais
oý ťtait le transporteur.
<i>"La maniŤre dont elle nous regarde,
on dirait un animal."</i>
<i>"Quand ils ont amenť cette
fille ŗ l'hŰpital,"</i>
<i>"je n'exerÁais que depuis six mois."</i>
<i>"J'avais envie de vomir."</i>
Et puis la machine a ťtť dťcouverte.
DŤs qu'elle est entrťe en contact
avec l'air, je l'ai senti.
<i>"Elle ne fait que parler, elle
n'a mÍme pas peur de nous."</i>
<i>"Elle ne fait que parler."</i>
Et j'ai trouvť ma Toshiko.
Ma belle Toshiko.
<i>"Je vais le faire maintenant."</i>
Owen, NON !
Laisse-la, Marie !
Laisse-la !
Toshiko, dis-leur de me
donner le transporteur.
Je peux pas, Marie.
<i>"C'est ridicule, on est pas armťs,
on ne fait que lui crier dessus."</i>
<i>"Pas encore.
S'il vous plaÓt, pas encore."</i>
<i>"Le couteau a une lame dentťe.
«a dťchirerai la gorge de Tosh."</i>
Toi, comment c'est ?
J'ťchange Toshiko contre celle lŗ !
C'est ton choix.
<i>"Non, non, pas Gwen."</i>
- L‚che ce couteau.
- Tu l'as entendu ? Il ne veut pas.
<i>"Elle a lu mes pensťes, elle
a vraiment lu mes pensťes."</i>
<i>"Qu'est-ce qui s'est passť ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il a dit ?"</i>
- S'il te plaÓt, non...
- Voilŗ ce qu'ils pensent de toi.
C'est avec eux que tu as travaillť
pendant toutes ces annťes.
C'est pas vrai, Tosh, l'ťcoute pas.
Mais pas moi. Quoi que j'ai fait, Áa
ne change pas mes sentiments pour toi.
Il y a un truc entre nous,
Toshiko, vraiment.
<i>"Toshiko... ne bouge pas."</i>
<i>"Ne fais rien jusqu'ŗ ce que
je te le dise."</i>
Ok, tu veux le transporteur,
on veut Toshiko.
<i>"J'ai ťtť entraÓnťe pour les
prises d'otages."</i>
<i>"Pour l'amour de dieu, rťflťchis !"</i>
Baisse ce couteau et je te donne
le transporteur.
<i>"Il va la laisser partir."</i>
<i>"C'est du bluff, mais je
pense que Áa va marcher."</i>
Tu ne sens...
- pas pareil qu'eux.
- C'est rien.
C'est quand tu compares avec
les dents d'un anglais,
que Áa fait vraiment peur.
- Qu'est-ce que tu es ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Et tu voulais me mettre en cage ?
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- Oh, Áa.
Je l'ai re-programmť pour toi.
Je l'ai mis sur permission.
- En quelque sorte.
- Qu'est-ce qu'elle ?
- Elle est rentrťe chez elle ?
- J'ai re-dťfini les coordonnťes.
- Vers oý ?
- Le centre du soleil.
«a devrait pas Ítre chaud.
Je veux dire, on l'a
envoyť la nuit et tout Áa.
- Tu l'as tuťe.
- Oui.
- Demande-lui.
- Oui, laisse-moi juste un peu de temps.
Dis-lui quelque chose.
Que veux-tu que je fasse ?
Elle en a endurť assez comme Áa.
- «a me fout vraiment les boules.
- C'est bon.
Owen, ne soit pas ťgoÔste.
Ok !
Depuis quand as-tu ce... pouvoir ?
- Juste quelques jours.
- Qu'as-tu entendu ?
Beaucoup de bruit.
Des ťmotions.
- Des rťfťrences que je ne comprenais pas.
- Oui, et le reste ?
- Le reste ne me regardait pas.
- Non. En effet.
- Je sais pas oý nous en sommes.
- Moi non plus.
On ne peut pas vraiment invoquer
la morale pour Áa.
Ce truc entre Owen et moi...
Non, Gwen.
Ce que j'ai fait ťtait une intrusion.
Je vois bien que je ne le contrŰlais
pas. Mais mÍme sans Áa, je ne...
Je dťteste vivre avec Áa.
Pas ce que j'ai entendu, mais
ce que je vous ai fait.
- Et ma trahison ?
- Comment Áa ?
Je vis avec la mienne.
«a devrait me rťveiller.
Je devrais m'arrÍter.
Mais je le ferai pas.
Qu'est-ce que Áa fait de moi ?
- Je ne suis pas en position de juger.
- C'est bien ce que je veux dire, Tosh.
Moi non plus.
Ne laisse pas Áa...
Non, rien. Dťsolťe, oublie Áa.
Quoi ?
Ne laisse pas Áa te dťcourager.
Ces derniers jours, tu avais
vraiment l'air bien.
L'amour t'allait bien.
C'est marrant.
Une si petite chose.
C'est sŻrement la plus puissante
technologie qu'on ait trouvť.
«a pourrait dťtruire des
gouvernements, des armťes.
Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire ?
A toi de dťcider.
C'est une malťdiction.
Pourquoi je ne pouvais pas
lire tes pensťes ?
Je ne sais pas.
Mais je pouvais te sentir
fouiller lŗ-dedans.
Je n'ai rien trouvť.
C'est comme si tu ťtais...
je ne sais pas, mort.
Je veux cette liste pour l'UNIT
sur mon bureau demain,
ou je...
Que font les patrons
dans ces cas lŗ ?
Tu sais, les patrons normaux.
Est-ce que je peux frapper les gens ?
On a des rŤgles pour Áa !
Dommage.
Jack...
Marie m'a dit quelque chose...
SŻrement la seule chose
honnÍte qu'elle ait dite.
Je lui ai demandť pourquoi elle
me l'avais donnť.
Et elle a dit,
"Au bout d'un moment Áa t'atteint."
"«a change ta maniŤre de voir les gens."
Comment je peux vivre avec Áa ?
Il y a des choses que l'on est
pas sensťs savoir.
Tu as eu de l'instantanť,
rien de plus.
Je ne parle pas de Gwen,
Ianto, et Owen.
Je veux dire... le monde entier.
«a n'a pas d'importance.
<i>Maintenant ces gens payent le prix
fort, dťcoupťs en morceaux,</i>
<i>votre nom ťcrit avec leur propre sang.</i>
<i>«a ramŤne les gens ŗ la vie.
On interroge juste les victimes de meurtres.</i>
<i>On est dans le pťtrin.</i>
<i>Il doit y avoir un lien
entre les victimes.</i>
<i>On trouve le lien, on trouve le tueur.</i>
Il est temps que Suzie revienne.
On a parlť au mauvais cadavre.

Suzie Costello.
Pourquoi as-tu tué ces gens ?
Plus j'utilise le gant,
plus je le contrôle.
Si je pouvais m'en servir tout le
temps, il pourrait ressusciter...
J'aimais ce travail.
Je l'aimais vraiment.
Enfin. Vous devez ętre Torchwood.
Mon équipe râle aprčs
vous tout le temps.
- Et vous ętes ?
- Détective Swanson.
Je suis le Capitaine Jack Harkness.
Je sais.
Etes-vous toujours aussi élégant
pour enquęter sur un meurtre ?
Quoi, vous me préféreriez nu ?
Que Dieu m'aide, les
histoires étaient vraies.
- Donc, qui est la victime ?
- Les victimes, au pluriel.
Hier, un homme a été tué au 96
Rue Oakham, Alex Arwyn, 28 ans,
célibataire, agent immobilier.
Tenez, ça vient de la scčne du crime.
Aujourd'hui, lŕ dedans,
nous en avons 2 de plus,
Mark et Sarah Brisco, 33 ans tous les 2,
mariés, il était géomčtre, elle
travaillait dans l'éducation.
Et ŕ propos des tâches de
sang ? Ca forme un mot ?
Travail en cours.
Rentrez et voyez l'oeuvre achevée.
Oh, mon Dieu...
On dirait que quelqu'un
réclame votre attention.
Ils l'ont.

~ www.seriessub.com ~
Nous avons trouvé quelques cheveux
du tueur du premier meurtre.
Les résultats du Labo
ne devraient pas tarder.
Bien, nous en aurons besoin.
Maintenant, si vous pouviez
juste quitter la pičce.
Certains de ces instruments sont
strictement confidentiels.
C'était juste une question de temps.
Comment ça ?
Torchwood parcourt toute la ville,
comme si elle vous appartenait.
Maintenant ces gens paient
le prix fort, des gens ordinaires,
massacrés, votre nom écrit
avec leur propre sang.
De mon point de vue, vous en ętes
la cause, Capitaine Jack Harkness.
Vous avez fait ça.
Enfin, au moins nous
avons un bon début.
Si c'est quelqu'un qu'on a énervé,
ça réduit ŕ environ...
oh, 4 ou 5 millions.
Et seulement pour les humains.
Tosh, qu'est-ce qu'on a ?
Il n'y a aucun enregistrement
pour M. et Mme Brisco
dans notre base de données.
Ni la victime d'hier, et aucun
lien entre lui et les Brisco.
Aucun lien entre eux.
Jack ? Ils ont les résultats
sur les cheveux du tueur.
Les premiers rapports énoncent :
homme blanc, la quarantaine,
fumeur, amateur de tequila.
L'ADN ne correspond ŕ aucun profil.
La seule chose intéressante est un
composant que nous n'avons jamais vu.
Vous le reconnaissez ?
- Oh, on est dans le pétrin.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Composant B67.
- Tu rigoles ?
- Retcon.
Il a du Retcon dans le sang.
B67, alias Retcon, alias l'ingrédient
magique de la pilule d'amnésie.
Et ça nous appartient ?
Nous avons donné une
pilule d'amnésie au tueur ?
Est-ce qu'il se souvient qu'il
est un tueur en série ?
Ou devient-il un tueur en
série ŕ cause du Retcon ?
Attendez une minute.
J'ai pris du Retcon.
Alors vaut mieux que tu restes
loin des objets tranchants.
Ianto, ŕ combien de personnes
avons-nous donné la pilule d'amnésie ?
A 2008 personnes.
Hé ! Et s'ils devenaient
tous psychotiques ?
T'es obligé de paraître si content ?
Je dis juste ça comme ça.
Comme dans Mean Streets !
Tosh, réduis la liste aux profils
correspondant ŕ ceux de Swanson,
et vérifie-les au plus vite.
Vous deux, il doit y avoir
un lien entre les victimes.
On trouve le lien, on trouve
le tueur. Au boulot !
Jack ? S'il y a un lien,
pourquoi ne demande-t-on donc
pas aux victimes elles-męmes ?
Pas le bon moment pour une
séance, merci beaucoup.
La premičre fois que j'ai rencontré
Torchwood, vous aviez ce gant.
- Hé hé, aucune chance !
- Pas aprčs ce qu'il a fait ŕ Suzie.
Il ramčne les gens ŕ la vie.
Juste pour 2 min,
on pourrait interroger
les victimes du meurtre.
C'est exactement ce qu'elle a dit.
Elle était l'une d'entre nous,
on avait confiance en elle
et maintenant elle est
morte ŕ cause de ça.
Le gant reste en
sűreté, lŕ oů il se trouve.
Ces meurtres arrivent
ŕ cause de Torchwood.
Donc Torchwood doit
faire quelque chose.
Il est tombé ŕ travers la
brčche il y a environ 40 ans.
Il était au fond de la baie
jusqu'ŕ ce que nous l'en sortions.
J'ai toujours pensé,
qu'il n'avait pas juste été
perdu. La personne qui l'a fait,
voulait s'en débarrasser.
Vous savez, on lui a
jamais donné de nom cool.
Je croyais qu'on l'appelait
le Gant de Résurrection ?
Un nom COOL.
Et pourquoi pas le Gant Ressuscitant ?
Je trouve ça accrocheur.
Jack ? Ca va ?
N'oubliez pas, le temps de
résurrection maximal est de 2 min,
et c'était seulement parce
que Suzie s'entraînait.
30 s me paraît le plus plausible
pour nous ok? Tosh, pręte ?
Pręte.
Et, ça enregistre.
Cet homme était la victime
numéro 1. Nom : Alex Arwyn.
Allez, Alex. Reviens.
Comment ça marche ?
C'est une sensation étrange.
Comme si tu atteignais l'au-delŕ.
Et tu y trouves le mort.
Je peux pas... Je ne...
Ah.
Merde ! Ah !
Ah ! Rien !
Désolé.
Plus jamais était trčs bien
pour cette chose. Owen ?
J'ai essayé la derničre fois.
On a tous essayé,
ça répond seulement ŕ Suzie.
Et bien, j'ai jamais essayé.
C'est froid.
Ca se réchauffe.
Le gant se fie ŕ une sorte d'empathie.
Peut ętre la compassion et...
Sois juste toi-męme.
Que quelqu'un m'aide !
Oh mon Dieu, aidez-moi,
aidez-moi, aidez-moi !
Alex !
Ecoute-moi attentivement.
Que quelqu'un m'aide !
AIDEZ-MOI !
Alex, tu t'es fait attaquer. Sais-tu
qui c'était ? Qui t'as attaqué ?
- Qui ętes-vous ?
- Combien de temps ?
- Je suis oů ?
- 15 secondes.
- Qui ętes-vous ?
- J'essaye juste de t'aider, mon coeur.
Je veux ma maman.
S'il vous plaît ! Laissez-moi voir ma maman...
- Il est parti.
- Laisse-moi réessayer.
Gwen, il est mort.
- Je peux le ramener.
- Le gant ne marche qu'une seule fois.
- Je peux le faire, laisse-moi essayer.
- Gwen. Regarde-moi.
Il est parti.
C'était incroyable, elle a
ça dans le sang. 24 secondes !
Donnez un chronomčtre
ŕ Ianto et il est heureux.
C'est le bouton du haut.
Qu'est-ce que t'en penses,
Gwen ? Tu veux arręter ?
Enregistrement en cours.
Victime numéro 2. Mark Brisco.
Oh mon Dieu, je peux le sentir,
c'est comme...
une corde relié de
mon coeur au gant...
Oh, c'est si chaud.
Salut toi. Regarde moi. Regarde
moi dans les yeux. C'est ça.
Oů suis-je ?
Tu as été blessé, on a pas longtemps,
on doit savoir qui t'a fait ça.
Est-ce que ma femme va bien ?
On s'occupe d'elle.
Maintenant Mark, c'était qui ?
C'était cet homme. Il venait des
Pčlerins. Il allait aux Pčlerins.
Qu'est-ce que c'est "Les Pčlerins" ?
Oh mon Dieu, il avait un couteau.
Non, Mark, il est parti, on a pas
longtemps, rapidement,
quel était son nom ?
35 secondes.
Max.
Jamais su son nom de famille.
Je cherche "Pčlerins" et "Max".
Il me faut une description.
Tu dois nous dire autre chose
pour qu'on puisse l'arręter.
Il part...
Il y avait...
Il y avait quelqu'un qui le
connaissait mieux... Cette femme...
- Elle parlait tout le temps de lui...
- Quel était son nom ?
Oů est ma femme ?
- Son nom !
- Suzie.
1 minute 5 secondes.
Jack ? J'ai bien entendu ?
Ca pourrait ętre n'importe qui,
Il doit y avoir plein de
femmes appelées Suzie.
Pas qui soient reliées ŕ cette affaire.
Nous parlons au mauvais corps.
Les Pčlerins. Un groupe d'aide religieux,
un groupe de débat.
Sens de la vie, est-ce que Dieu existe ?
Toutes ces choses lŕ.
Le fait est que c'était petit,
plus comme un loisir,
dirigé par la femme de
Mark Brisco, Sarah.
Elle avait planqué tout
ça dans son armoire.
Manuscrits et photocopies,
c'est pourquoi on trouvait rien,
c'était męme pas en ligne.
- Aucune mention de Suzie, ou Max ?
- Pas un mot.
Elle tenait męme pas de registre.
Mais ça ne doit pas ętre notre Suzie.
Elle n'irait pas dans une connerie
de groupe d'entraide.
Comment tu sais ça ?
Je veux dire, vous étiez
amis ? L'un d'entre vous ?
Qui était son meilleur ami ici ?
Elle ne s'ouvrait pas trop.
Bien, alors.
Si elle avait besoin de parler,
c'est peut-ętre exactement oů elle irait,
dans un groupe de parfaits étrangers.
En effet. Tu marques un point Gwen.
Il est temps de connaître  un
peu mieux notre collčgue décédée.
Est-ce que j'aurais ce droit ?
Quand je serai morte, vous
garderez tous mes biens ?
Ma vie entičre sera
planquée dans un casier ?
Rčgles et réglementations.
Et si je laissais toutes
mes affaires ŕ Rhys ?
On le planquerait, lui aussi.
Manipulez minutieusement,
tout le monde. Avec respect.
C'est la vie de Suzie Costello.
C'est tout ce que nous sommes, au final.
Une pile de boîtes.
Est-ce que son pčre
est toujours en vie ?
Je sais pas.
Mais vous avez dű le voir ?
Pour lui dire que sa fille était morte ?
Quand Suzie a quitté
Torchwood, elle était pressée.
Elle a effacé tous ses enregistrements.
J'ai pas pu retrouver ses fichiers,
elle était bonne en informatique.
Elle était bonne en tout.
Elle était bonne pour tuer aussi.
Laisse-moi rire une minute,
c'était Suzie.
C'est quoi ?
Un livre.
Emily Dickinson.
Počte.
Jack.
Les Pčlerins.
Elle en faisait partie.
Ca concorde, donc. Pas le choix.
C'est l'heure du retour de Suzie.
On est tous congelés ?
Le personnel de Torchwood,
quand on meurt, on est tous conservés ?
- Rčgles et réglementations.
- Pour combien de temps ?
- Pour toujours.
- Enregistrement en cours.
- Tu as ton chronomčtre ?
- Toujours.
J'enregistrerai depuis mon poste.
Je suis désolée, mais je veux pas
la regarder dans les yeux. Désolée.
Quelqu'un d'autre ?
Un conseil ?
Ouais, je sais. Empathie. Męme si
elle a essayé de me tuer.
Toi et moi.
J'ai un pouls.
Non, il a disparu...
Juste...des souvenirs.
Rien de vivant. Elle est
morte depuis trop longtemps.
- Qu'est-ce qu'on fait maintenant ?
- On peut rien faire.
C'est fini.
- On a plus d'options.
- Il y a toujours le couteau.
Quand elle a tué tous ces gens,
elle utilisait toujours le couteau,
il est fait du męme métal que le gant.
On l'a déjŕ vu avant, écho métallique.
Le gant fonctionne mieux si le
couteau fait partie du processus,
comme un circuit fermé.
Alors utilisons-le.
Petit détail. Le couteau était
utilisé pour tuer des gens.
- Elle est déjŕ morte.
- Donc on la tue ŕ nouveau.
Ianto ?
Couteau de vie.
Quelque chose ?
Non, il y a eu une sorte
d'éclair puis c'est reparti.
Je suis désolée, Jack. Tu vas
devoir le faire correctement.
Oh, et puis merde...
- Suzie ?
- Je dois partir !
- Regarde juste oů tu es.
- Je peux pas rester, ils savent.
Réfléchis, rappelle-toi...
Suzie ! Suzie ! Regarde-moi !
Jack. Oh mon Dieu. Il y a
un couteau dans ma poitrine,
- Tu m'as tuée ?
- Tu t'es suicidée, tu te souviens ?
Mais... Oh mon Dieu,
je me suis tiré dessus.
On veut savoir pour "Les Pčlerins".
Non. Attends une minute.
Je t'avais pas tué ?
Peu importe, on a besoin
de noms et de détails.
- Qui utilise le gant ?
- Je suis désolée.
Oh, comme par hasard,
foutue Gwen Cooper !
30 secondes.
Quand tu étais aux Pčlerins,
tu as donné la pilule
d'amnésie ŕ Max,
tu te souviens ?
Quoi ? Vous me ramenez
juste pour Max ?!
On doit le trouver. Qui est-ce ?
Quel est son nom ?!
C'était...
- un perdant...
- On la perd.
Reste ici nom de Dieu !
Ne force pas, Gwen.
Elle s'enfuira pas cette
fois, reste lŕ !
- Non !
- Je t'avais dit d'arręter !
C'est bon, je la tiens, je la tiens...
Accroche-toi... Ok, pouls. Elle va bien.
On doit la sortir de lŕ.
Tu peux m'aider ?
C'est le gant, je t'avais dit
que les morts t'attireraient.
Ok, n'en fais pas une
histoire, c'est fini maintenant.
Euh, excusez-moi.
Je compte toujours.
Plus besoin, elle est morte.
Non, d'aprčs l'équipement,
elle est inconsciente.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe, bordel ?
Oh mon Dieu. Il a raison.
Elle est vivante.
Suzie est toujours vivante.
Regardez-lŕ, elle respire,
bon sang !
Pas possible...
Non.
Elle respire toujours.
Si on l'arręte pas.
Elle ne mourra pas.
1 minute 30 en tout.
Ca fait combien de temps ?
Trois mois.
Quand pourrais-je mourir ?
Je veux juste partir.
Vous pouvez pas me laisser tranquille ?
Tu sembles coincée.
Mais...
Je vais rester comme ça ?
Pour combien de temps ?
Je sais pas.
- Je peux voir mon pčre ?
- Non.
Tu as effacé tes données.
On a aucune trace de lui.
Donc, il ne sait męme
pas que je suis morte ?
Et bien, tu ne l'es plus.
C'est malsain.
C'est toi qui as commencé.
En ce moment,
on a une enquęte en cours.
Les Pčlerins.
Tu es allée aux réunions des Pčlerins
<i>et tu as donné une pilule
d'amnésie ŕ un certain Max.</i>
<i>Comment le retrouver?</i>
Pourquoi ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il a fait ?
C'était juste un gars ordinaire.
On pense que le Retcon
a déclenché une psychose.
Il a commencé ŕ tuer.
- Combien de victimes ?
- Trois. Tout comme toi.
<i>On doit savoir, combien
de Retcon lui as-tu donné ?</i>
Owen. Salut.
<i>Peur de me voir.</i>
Tu me fais super flipper, ouais.
<i>Et Toshiko ? Elle est toujours lŕ ?</i>
Ouais, elle est lŕ.
Toute la bande. Jours heureux !
Mais les pilules d'amnésie,
combien tu lui en as donné ?
Une par semaine. Chaque
semaine. Pendant deux ans.
Oh mon Dieu ! Tu m'étonnes.
Pourquoi t'as fait ça, bordel ?
Je...
voulais juste quelqu'un ŕ qui parler.
A propos d'ici.
Ca me rendait folle.
Et il était juste...
Il écoutait, c'est tout, il écoutait.
Chaque semaine, dčs que je finissais
de parler, je lui donnais la pilule.
- Tu l'as drogué.
- Je le savais pas!
Je continue de mal faire, hein ?
C'est pour ça que vous
m'avez ramenée ?
Vous pensiez pas que
j'étais assez coupable ?
- Quel était son nom ?
- Je sais pas.
Tout ce que j'ai fait
est de parler de moi.
Tout est de ma faute, hein ?
Ca n'arrętera jamais d'ętre
ma putain de faute.
Vous pouvez pas juste
me laisser mourir ?
On laisse pas tomber aussi facilement.
Ouais, tu m'avais
averti, dčs le début.
Il a dit: "C'est le seul travail oů
tu ne pourras jamais démissionner."
Alors mettons nous au travail !
Allez, Suzie !
Comme au bon vieux temps.
Il doit y avoir quelque chose.
Attendez... Il manque quelqu'un.
Cette fille venait chaque semaine,
étudiante, blonde...
Elle n'est pas sur ces photos.
- C'était qui ?
- Lucy.
Lucy Mackenzie.
Elle disait qu'elle travaillait
dans un club.
Lequel ?
Euh...
Allez, Suzie !
Quel club ?
Pour l'amour de Dieu, ce Max
tue chaque membre des Pčlerins.
Maintenant dis-moi,
Lucy Mackenzie,
elle travaillait oů,
quel club ?!
Wolf.
Au Wolf Bar.
Couvrez les sorties.
Putain, comme si j'avais pas
assez mal au crâne comme ça.
C'est le gant, Gwen.
Il rentre dans ton esprit.
Ouais, ok Suzie,
arręte de me chercher.
Dis-nous juste si tu vois Max
ou cette Lucy Mackenzie.
Encore rien.
Continuez de tourner.
Restez en alerte,
tout le monde.
Je répčte, Max: 40 ans, 1m90,
costaud, cheveux noirs courts,
tatouage au bas du bras gauche.
Ca réduit.
Tu peux męme pas me
regarder, hein ?
C'est pas ton style de juger autant.
Ni le tien de massacrer des gens.
Ok, il nous rend donc fou,
ce travail.
Dieu sait, que j'ai
fait des choses stupides.
Mais maintenant, je dois continuer
de faire, chaque jour,
un travail un peu moins honorable,
ŕ cause de toi.
Attendez, j'ai un gars
qui correspond.
- Oů est-il ?
- Bar côté Nord Ouest.
Montre moi.
Owen, plus prčs,
c'est lequel ?
Attendez, il part...
Attendez, j'ai une fille correspondant
ŕ Lucy Mackenzie, l'étudiante.
C'est elle, c'est sűr, c'est elle.
C'est trop tard, il va vers elle.
J'ai eu le connard !
C'est pas lui !
Gwen ! Derričre toi !
Ca c'est pour Ianto.
Le Gant Ressuscitant, le
Couteau de Vie, et ce bon vieux
Electrochoc.
- Allez, sortons-le de lŕ.
- Tu m'as sauvé la vie.
Peut-ętre que je suis
revenue pour une raison.
Ok, donc votre nom est Max
Tresillian, vous pouvez confirmer ?
Vous habitez au 106 Endeavour
Terrace, c'est bien ça ?
Vos parents sont Sandra et Dave, non ?
Vous ętes ŕ Torchwood.
Et 5, 6... continue d'observer.
Dčs que j'arriverai ŕ 10...
Il s'arręte d'un coup.
Si c'est une psychose causée
par la drogue,
c'en est vraiment une particuličre.
Comme réagir au mot Torchwood.
Merci, Jack.
Désolé.
Si c'est ŕ cause du Retcon,
nous avons 1 million de problčmes
en plus qui nous attendent.
- Fais-moi savoir ce que dit le scan.
- Et pour Suzie ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire d'elle ?
Aucune idée.
Qu'est-ce que t'en penses ?
C'est toi le chef.
Torchwood !
Tu peux pas demander ŕ Jack ?
Juste une faveur.
Je veux voir mon pčre.
Dis-nous oů il est,
on pourra l'amener ici.
Je ne le laisse aller nulle
part prčs de Torchwood.
S'il est toujours vivant.
Qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
Un cancer.
Toute cette attente, puis
je pars et meurs la premičre.
Je pourrais le contacter en ton nom.
Et lui dire quoi ?
Alors, dis-moi. Depuis que
je suis partie, ça te plaît ?
Oui.
Oui. Enfin, tu sais, cet
endroit est une sorte de...
- C'est fou, hein ?
- Démentiel.
- Vraiment dingue.
- Le meilleur boulot que j'aie jamais eu.
- Moi aussi.
- Et le pire.
Ouais, tu me le fais pas dire.
C'est une drôle de chose : tu
t'imagines toujours quand tu meurs,
que tu vas leur manquer au travail.
Que tu es indispensable !
Mais regarde ce qui s'est passé.
J'ai été remplacée...
...par quelqu'un de mieux.
Tu fais marcher ce gant
mieux que moi.
C'est juste de la chance.
Non, c'est plus que ça.
Les autres, ils te préfčrent.
Dis pas ça.
Tu as mon travail.
Comme si t'avais planifié ça.
Sauf que je ne l'ai pas fait.
Et je suis désolée, mais j'ai ma propre
fonction au sein de Torchwood
et je suis beaucoup plus
qu'un simple remplacement.
As-tu couché avec Owen ?
Nous y voilŕ, tu m'as
complčtement remplacée.
J'avais un petit copain qui
rentrait dans les pičces comme ça.
La grande entrée.
C'était un peu fatiguant.
Mais il avait un jumeau, alors je
le supportais. Des jumeaux acrobates.
Mec... je devrais écrire ce bouquin.
Peut-ętre męme l'illustrer.
Je peux parler pendant
longtemps, vraiment longtemps.
Donne-moi un instant pour
rassembler mes idées.
C'est-ŕ-dire ?
Suzie avait le gant.
Tu l'as désignée responsable de ça.
Mais dis-moi Jack, tu lui as
jamais demandé pour son pčre ?
- Comment ça ?
- Il a un cancer.
Il meurt ŕ petit feu
maintenant depuis des années.
Et qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Tu donnes ŕ sa fille le seul instrument
capable de ramener les gens ŕ la vie !
Tu te demandes pas
pourquoi elle est obsédée ?
- Oh, donc tout est de ma faute ?!
- Et bien ça l'est, non ?
Tu t'es jamais arręté,
pour réfléchir ?
N'as-tu...
N'as-tu jamais regardé Suzie ?
N'as-tu jamais...
pensé ŕ ce que le
gant lui ferait, hein ?
Depuis le début,
tu pensais que la mort
de Suzie était ta faute.
Parce que ça s'est passé
quand tu es arrivée.
Ensuite tu l'as ramené ŕ la vie,
tout ça parce que tu le voulais. OK ?!
On est tous les deux responsables !
- Bordel, que va-t-on faire d'elle ?!
- Je ne sais pas.
Et si elle ne meurt jamais ?
As-tu pensé ŕ ça ? Comme...
Immortels, pour toujours.
Juste toi et elle.
- Aucune chance.
- Ca se pourrait.
Je ne lui souhaite pas ça. Je
la tuerais plutôt sur le champ.
- Parce que tu pourrais la tuer ?
- Ouais.
- Vraiment ?
- Oh, Ouais.
<i>Jack, peux-tu venir ŕ la salle
de conférence une seconde ?</i>
<i>Il y a quelque chose qu'il faut
que tu voies. Assez urgent.</i>
Je vérifiais les enregistrements
médicaux de Gwen et Suzie.
Je les ai passés au filtre.
Regarde la pellicule.
C'est au moment oů Gwen
ramčne Mark Brisco, le mari.
Tu vois ?
Maintenant regarde ŕ sa
mort. Tu vois ?
Le flot d'énergie s'arręte juste
au moment oů il meurt. Mais...
jette un coup d'oeil ŕ
Gwen, avec Suzie.
Wow...
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
De l'énergie.
De la vie.
Mais avec Suzie, c'est un lien
permanent, elle devient plus forte.
Il existe toujours en ce moment męme.
Elle draine la vie de Gwen.
Il y a toujours un prix.
Plus de café ? C'est tout ce que tu
sais faire ? Laisse-moi tranquille.
Prends au moins un biscuit.
Vas-y.
Juste pour moi.
Le porteur du gant peut
ramener quelqu'un,
mais il perd sa propre
vie en échange.
Comment on arręte ça ?
On doit la tuer.
Suzie doit mourir.
- Une nouvelle fois ?!
- Qui va faire ça ?
Comme tu l'as dit.
Je suis le chef.
Toshiko. Oů est Suzie, bordel ?
Et oů est Gwen ?
En salle d'interrogation.
Non elles n'y sont
pas... Trouve-les, vite !
Je ne les trouve pas.
Attends. Scan en cours.
Non.
Rien sur les scanners internes.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe,
oů sont-elles parties ?
Continue de chercher...
- Vérifie le SUV.
- Toujours lŕ.
Je vais essayer ŕ l'extérieur...
Peut-ętre la voiture de Gwen ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'elle fait ?
- Elle se fait virer.
C'est totalement stupide.
Croire qu'elle peut s'enfuir en voiture.
Allez. Il faut les rattraper.
Qu'est-ce que...
Ianto ?
- Ianto ?
- Capitaine.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Je pensais que c'était toi.
Nous sommes en quarantaine.
- Et bien annule-la !
- Je peux pas.
C'est ŕ 100%.
Les portes sont scellées.
Nous sommes enfermés !
Je t'emmčne voir ton
pčre et c'est tout, ok ?
Désolée.
Je dois ętre folle.
Jack n'est pas stupide.
Il nous rattrapera.
Oh, on sait jamais.
On aura peut ętre de la chance.
Tout est mort. Les ordinateurs,
le réseau, les ascenseurs, tout...
On est bloqués.
Combien de temps a
Gwen avant de mourir ?
- 2 heures, peut-ętre moins.
- Réfléchis !
Si Suzie a lancé la quarantaine,
comment elle a fait ?
En neutralisant la sécurité ?
Non, elle est officiellement
morte, elle n'aurait pas eu l'accčs.
Alors comment elle a fait ?
Qu'est-ce qu'elle a fait, bordel ?!
Il doit y avoir une réponse.
Suzie ne pouvait pas
démarrer la quarantaine,
Gwen ne l'aurait pas laissé faire.
Mais il n'y a personne d'autre !
Attends une minute... On a un invité.
<i>... arręté pour moi.</i>
<i>Le chariot ne retient que
l'immortalité et nous</i>
car je ne me suis pas
arręté devant la mort...
C'est un počme ?
Je me demande. Emily Dickinson ?
- Mais qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
- C'est un mécanisme verbal.
Dis-le ŕ voix haute, répčte-le
peut-ętre 100 fois
et le Hub se referme sur lui-męme.
Mais si ça fait partie du systčme,
Suzie a dű installer un programme
de commande vocale, il y a longtemps.
Quand elle était vivante, ouais.
Max est juste un cheval de Troie.
Suzie avait prévu ça depuis le début.
<i>Tu piges ? Max, le Retcon, tout
est un canular pour ressusciter Suzie.</i>
Elle a donné ŕ Max un bloc entier
de déclencheurs subconscients.
Comme ça, si elle meurt, Max
devient une bombe ŕ retardement...
<i>Il ne l'a pas vue depuis 3 mois
et, paf, les ordres arrivent.</i>
Il suit le programme de
Suzie, et commence ŕ tuer.
Et la chaîne d'événements entičre
nous force ŕ ramener Suzie.
- Et alors elle s'échappe !
- Vous savez, c'est pas mal !
Je la prends dans mon équipe.
Si elle a pu mettre le Hub
en quarantaine,
elle a dű installer un moyen
de l'arręter, juste au cas oů.
Ouais !
Tu reprends un peu de couleur.
C'est grâce ŕ toi.
Cette nuit...
ma derničre nuit sur Terre,
enfin je pensais...
...avant que je ne me tue, j'ai
tiré sur Jack en pleine tęte.
Je l'ai tué, raide mort, et
alors il s'est relevé et il était en vie.
J'ai raison ? Ca s'est passé ?
- Gwen ?
- Oui.
Donc il peut survivre ŕ une
balle en pleine tęte ?
Ouais.
Comment ?
Je ne sais pas.
Il ne l'a pas expliqué clairement.
Il a dit que quelque chose lui était
arrivé, il y a longtemps. Il a dit...
Il a dit qu'il ne pouvait pas mourir.
Plus jamais.
Et il juge si je suis
autorisée ŕ vivre ou non.
Tout est facile pour le
Capitaine Jack, hein ?
- Tu te demandes jamais ?
- Quoi ?
Qui il est ?
Tout le temps.
J'ai une tonalité, chef.
Comment t'as fait ça ?
On est bloqués !
J'ai juste utilisé la Tour
d'Eau comme un relais.
Beau boulot, Ianto !
Mais qui on appelle, bordel ?!
Détective Swanson.
- Qui est-ce ?
- Torchwood.
Vous avez intéręt ŕ pas
me faire perdre mon temps.
Et bien en fait je me demandais si
vous pouviez nous rendre service.
L'humble police, aidant le
puissant Torchwood ?
Pourquoi ne pas vous aider vous-męmes ?
Comme vous faites d'habitude.
- Parce qu'on peut pas.
- Pourquoi ça ?
On est en quelque sorte occupé.
Et bien, moi aussi,
trouvez quelqu'un d'autre.
Non, non, non...
C'est juste qu'on peut
pas en ce moment
parce qu'on est quelque peu coincés.
- C'est-ŕ-dire ?
- On est enfermés.
Vous ętes enfermés ?
- Juste un peu.
- Enfermés oů ?
Hum. Dans notre propre base.
Vous ętes enfermés dans
votre propre base ?
Et ce n'est pas drôle.
Et comment je suis supposée
vous aider, exactement ?
On a besoin d'un livre de poésie.
<i>Ce n'est PAS drôle !</i>
Oh, mon Dieu, rouler de nuit...
Oh, mon Dieu...
Je ne connais pas celle lŕ.
C'est vieux.
Ma mčre avait l'habitude de la chanter,
quand j'étais petite.
Il y a tant d'années...
...avant que je meure.
Ok, Capitaine Jack, dites-le juste
une fois de plus. Bien fort.
<i>On est enfermés dans notre
propre base et on peut pas sortir.</i>
Ok, vous avez bien ri.
Ecoutez, Détective Swanson,
une des nôtres est en danger.
Ok, vous autres, au boulot...
Ok, on l'a.
Les Počmes Complets, ça va
vous coűter 30€.
Qu'est-ce que dit le livre ?
Euh, je sais pas, qu'est-ce
que je suis censée faire ?!
Trouvez "Je ne me suis
pas arręté devant la mort."
- Lisez ŕ voix haute le vers suivant.
- Et si ça ne marche pas ?
Lisez le livre en entier.
Ca va ętre une longue nuit.
Fatiguée ?
Ca va.
Je veux pas que tu
t'endormes sur le volant.
Un cadavre est suffisant
pour cette voiture, merci.
Dis pas ça.
- Quoi ?
- Cadavre. Car tu n'en es pas un.
- Qu'est-ce que je suis, alors ?
- Je sais pas, pas un cadavre, c'est tout.
Quand tu es morte...
Je veux dire, quand tu meurs...
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux que je dise ?
- La vérité.
Vraiment ?
Dis-moi.
- T'es religieuse ?
- Un peu de temps en temps, tu vois.
- Crois-tu au Paradis ?
- Je sais pas.
Si, tu sais. Tu crois en quoi ?
C'est stupide, mais
j'ai toujours pensé...
Tu sais, la lumičre
blanche, et tout ça.
Et je pense ŕ ma grand mčre.
Si elle sera lŕ.
M'attendant.
L'odeur de vieux.
Ta foi n'a jamais quitté l'école primaire.
Alors, il y a quoi lŕ-bas ?
Rien.
Simplement rien.
Mais, s'il n'y a rien, ŕ
quoi bon mener une vie ?
Pour ça.
Rouler ŕ travers la nuit.
Toutes ces stupides,
minuscules choses.
Nous sommes juste des animaux,
hurlant dans la nuit,
parce que c'est mieux que le silence.
J'avais l'habitude de penser ŕ
Torchwood, ŕ tous ces...
aliens, venant sur Terre.
Et pourquoi ça ?
Mais c'est juste l'instinct.
Ils viennent ici parce qu'il
y a de la vie, c'est tout.
Comme un papillon
autour d'une flamme.
Des créatures s'aggripant dans le froid.
Donc quand tu meurs, c'est juste...
Les ténčbres.
Et tu es toute seule ?
Il y a personne d'autre ?
- J'ai pas dis ça.
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
Pourquoi crois-tu que je sois
si désespérée de revenir ?
Il y a quelque chose lŕ bas...
...dans le noir...
...et ça se met ŕ bouger.
Partager est tout ce
qu'on connaît du paradis
et tout ce qu'on doit savoir de l'enfer.
Non, essayez un autre.
Le succčs est compté dans la douceur
par ceux qui ne réussissent jamais.
Mon dieu, elle en
tenait une sacrée couche.
Le succčs est compté dans la douceur
par ceux qui ne réussissent jamais.
Non.
Attendez une minute,
je viens juste de penser...
Si ce sont les mots qui ont
causé la quarantaine,
peut ętre que les nombres l'annuleront...
Essayez le numéro ISBN, chaque
livre a un nombre différent.
- Vous avez entendu ?
- Ouais, patientez, je regarde...
Lisez fort.
Les claviers ne marchent pas.
La membrane reconnaîtra
peut ętre le code.
Ok. Je l'ai !
ISBN 019 8600 585.
Ca y est ! Tout le monde, on se
bouge, allez, allez ! Cathy, merci.
Au plaisir !
J'ai le traqueur sur
la voiture de Gwen.
C'est un hôpital.
Je t'envoie les coordonnées.
En chemin. Elle a encore
combien de temps ?
A vu d'oeil, je dirais qu'il
reste ŕ Gwen environ 40 min.
Cathy, je veux que les
routes soient dégagées.
Je vais devoir dépasser la
limite de vitesse, de beaucoup.
A toutes les unités, donnez
la priorité ŕ Torchwood,
je répčte, donnez la
priorité ŕ Torchwood.
Suzie... je ne,
hum... je ne...
Oh, mon Dieu, ce
mal de tęte, c'est...
Qu'est-ce qu'il m'arrive ?
Je suis désolée, Gwen.
Tu te fais tirer dans la tęte.
Tout doucement.
Et crois moi, ça fait mal.
Ca s'arrange.
Ca sera bientôt complčtement parti.
Non !
Non, non, non...
Papa ?
C'est moi, papa.
Réveille toi !
Papa ? C'est Suzie.
Salut, papa.
Oh !
Et Adieu.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Oh, ça valait la peine de revenir.
Pour l'envoyer dans les ténčbres.
Juste ce que ce connard mérite.
Elles bougent ŕ nouveau.
Je peux pas définir
une destination précise,
pas encore.
Continue de nous donner
les infos, on les rattrape.
Allo ?
As-tu aimé le počme, Jack ?
Suzie, ne la laisse pas mourir.
Le gant tue Gwen et te garde en vie.
Je sais.
- Alors arręte.
- Mais ça me permet de vivre.
- Pourquoi j'arręterais ?
- Pour le bien de Gwen.
Elle m'a remplacée.
Maintenant, je fais la męme
chose avec elle. Normal, non ?
Suzie, on a un traqueur sur
cette voiture, on va te rattraper,
<i>je le promets.</i>
Et qu'est qui arrivera aprčs ?
Si elle est morte, je vais te tuer,
Suzie Costello.
Je le promets, je te tuerai
pour la stricte derničre fois.
Le pourrais-tu ?
Alors qu'il y a une partie
d'elle en moi maintenant ?
Pourrais-tu vraiment faire ça si j'étais
la seule chose qu'il restait d'elle ?
Pourquoi fais-tu ça ?
Parce que la vie est tout, Jack.
<i>Tu devrais le savoir.</i>
Je ferais n'importe quoi pour rester.
N'importe quoi.
Suzie. S'il te plaît. Arręte.
C'est une bonne trouvaille, celle-lŕ.
Gwen Cooper.
Elle est mieux que moi.
Elle est tellement mieux.
Je n'étais jamais assez bonne.
Jack, je suis désolée.
SUZIE !
<i>Jack, elle se dirige
vers la côte sur la B587.</i>
<i>C'est un endroit appelé Hedley Point,
il y a des ferrys,</i>
allant jusqu'aux îles.
Continue d'avancer.
Owen, on a combien de temps ?
Quelques minutes.
C'est beau, Gwen.
Tu peux voir ?
On va prendre le ferry.
Partir. Aussi loin que possible.
Continue de courir, il
ne nous fera pas de mal.
On va continuer ensemble,
toi et moi...
Oh, je suis désolée.
Tu es partie ? Gwen ?
Tu m'entends ?
Gwen ?
Pauvre Gwen Cooper.
Bon voyage.
Laisse-la partir.
Je peux pas.
- Laisse Gwen partir.
- Je peux pas.
Owen, comment elle va ?
Owen ! Au rapport !
- Je pense qu'on arrive trop tard.
- Si je te tue, est-ce qu'elle vivra ?
Mais tu peux pas, Jack.
Car regarde moi.
Je suis la derničre chose qu'il reste
de Gwen Cooper, tu ne le vois pas ?
Rien qu'une petite partie d'elle ?
Pas une seule.
Owen ? Quelque chose ?
- Rien.
- Mais j'ai coupé la connexion.
- Je t'ai tuée.
- Je ne peux pas mourir.
Je ne mourrai jamais.
Combien de balles
de plus tu veux ?
Tout est de ta faute, Jack.
Tu m'as engagée.
Le gant. Tosh ! Détruis le
gant ! Il les garde connectées !
Ianto, armes, Code Cinq.
Capitaine, mon capitaine.
Veux-tu savoir un secret ?
Il y a quelque chose qui
bouge dans les ténčbres
et il arrive,
Jack Harkness.
Il vient pour toi.
- Whoah! Whoah!
- C'est bon.
C'est bon, c'est bon, c'est bon.
<i># If I should die this very moment</i>
<i># I wouldn't fear</i>
<i># For I have never known completeness</i>
<i># Like being here</i>
<i># Wrapped in the warmth of you</i>
<i># Loving every breath of you</i>
<i># Still my heart, this moment</i>
<i># Or it might burst</i>
<i># Could we stay right here

<i># Till the earth stops turning?</i>
<i># Wanna love you till the seas run dry</i>
<i># I found the one I've waited for. #</i>
- Merci de faire ça.
- Ca fait partie de mon travail, chef.
Non, je devrais le faire, mais...
Un jour, nous allons
manquer de place...
Si tu es intéressé...
J'ai toujours ce chronomčtre.
Et ?
Et bien, penses-y.
On peut faire plein de
choses avec un chronomčtre.
Oh, ouais !
- J'en vois quelques-unes.
- Il y en a pas mal.
Je renvoie les autres plus tôt.
Viens dans mon bureau dans 10 min.
Dans 10 minutes,
top chrono.
Oh, Jack ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux que je
mette sur le certificat de décčs ?
Bonne question.
Elle a eu plusieurs décčs au final.
Je sais pas.
Mort par Torchwood.
Je mettrai un cadenas sur la porte,
juste au cas oů elle se remette ŕ errer.
Nan, aucune chance.
Les jours de résurrection
sont finis, Dieu merci.
Oh, je n'en serais pas si sűr.
C'est-ce qu'on dit ŕ
propos des gants, chef.
Ils viennent par paire.
Excusez-moi.
Suis-je mort ?
Quelque chose est arrivé,
on doit te parler.
Est-ce qu'il est allé sur
la route de lui-męme ?
Oh, je suis au Paradis.
Il nous a montré mon Eugene.
Ecoute ça, Eugene avait un
oeil alien dans sa collection.
Il l'a vendu sur le net.
Un 6čme oeil de Dogon ?
Peut-ętre.
Oh.
Je ressens juste.
Que... Il y a quelque
chose qui arrive.
Je ne veux pas que
ça s'arręte.
Je t'aime.

Indépendant du Gouvernement,

Le 21ème siècle est un

La vitesse de la lumière est de

Salut, Gwen. Jack ! Euh, Tosh...
On m'a laissé passer
la sécurité, alors...
Je dirais au moins 80 km/h.
Passe sur le capot, rebondit,
roule sûrement, s'écrase par terre.
Hé ? Hum, désolé, mais
ça me ressemble beaucoup.
Il pouvait même pas traverser
la rue correctement.
Pas de sac, rien.
Qu'est-ce qu'il faisait là ?
On l'a peut-être renversé exprès ?
Peut-être qu'il avait vraiment
quelque chose d'important.
Comme quoi ?
Je sais pas. Il essayait toujours de
nous parler, nous montrer des trucs.
On aurait peut-être dû...
Gwen, je pense que c'est un
AVP ordinaire.
C'était une voiture rouge. Il y a
de la peinture rouge sous ses ongles.
Je suis mort ?
Je suis mort ?
Je suis mort ?

Oui ?
Mon chéri, je reviens des courses,
j'ai oublié d'acheter du thé.
Allô... ?
- Eugène ?
- Bonjour, Mme Jones.
Il s'est passé quelque chose.
Il faut qu'on vous parle.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Comment j'ai fini là ?
Je suis mort, mais je suis pas mort.
Alors... Merde !
Alors, je suis un fantôme
ou un zombie ?
Oh, mon Dieu. Calme toi.
Reste avec l'équipe.
Quoi ? Tu conduis.
C'est Torchwood, ça va aller.
Quoi ? ! Bien sûr, je suis invisible.
Pourquoi je suis invisible ?
Rien sur son téléphone
datant d'aujourd'hui ?
Juste des photos de différentes chaussures.
Ça me semble familier.
Quoi qu'il se soit passé, au moins
je suis là où j'ai toujours voulu être.
Revenons un peu en arrière.
Chaque histoire a son début.
Je crois que la mienne commence là...
La finale de la compétition
inter-écoles de maths, en 1992.
J'étais une tête en maths. Code binaire,
topologie, équations du 2nd degrés...
J'adorais ces trucs là.
Et j'étais supposé être très bon.
Et un total de 42 pour Rushmore...
On félicite l'équipe gagnante, Rushmore...
Papa avait pris sa journée pour venir
me voir, mais au moment tant attendu,
j'ai séché,
j'ai laissé tomber,
j'ai tout fait foirer.
Pour tout le monde, on avait
perdu la finale par ma faute.
..mais c'est sûrement avec ce qui s'est
passé après que tout ça a commencé.
As-tu déjà regardé
attentivement ma collection ?
Non, monsieur.
- Ça te plairait ?
- Non, monsieur.
Je joue au golf.
Oh. C'est bien, monsieur.
Un jour
où je jouais très mal...
J'étais coincé à la première fosse,
pataugeant dans le sable...
..et cette chose est tombée du ciel,
et a atterri : plop !  A côté de moi.
- Du ciel ?
- Oui.
On dirait un peu une balle de golf, alors
je l'ai ramassée et mise dans ma poche.
Mais quand je l'ai bien regardée,
plus tard... Tiens.
J'ai réalisé que c'était un oeil.
Et je me suis dit,
"D'où ça a bien pu venir ?"
C'est tombé du ciel.
C'est étonnant, non ?
Prends-le.
Où est-ce que t'étais, bon sang ? !
- Bonsoir...
- Bonsoir.
Viens, Eugène.
Tu as tout pris ?
Oui. Merci, monsieur.
Je suis allé à l'école, non ! ?
Papa m'en voulait
d'avoir perdu la finale.
Mais maintenant, j'avais l'oeil.
Et j'ai réalisé que, s'il est
tombé du ciel, peut-être... Non...
Non, j'étais presque
certain qu'il était à un alien.
C'est la nuit où Papa est parti.
Mais c'était bon, j'avais l'oeil, et
la possibilité de rencontrer un alien.
Je veux dire, si t'oublies quelque chose
d'important, tu reviens le chercher.
Non ?
Je voulais que cet alien revienne
réclamer son oeil plus que tout au monde.
J'ai établi les provenances possibles,
forme de vie et galaxie,
vitesse de libération planétaire,
fenêtre de lancement,
quantité de fuel nécessaire,
et puis, j'ai attendu.
<i>There's a star man
waiting in the sky</i>
<i>He'd like to come and meet us
but he thinks he'll blow our minds</i>
<i>There's a star man
waiting in the sky</i>
<i>He's told us not to...</i>
Mon père n'est jamais revenu.
En grandissant, je me suis
interessé aux OVNI,
collectionnant des artefacts aliens,
regardant les étoiles,
en attendant seul mon alien.
Et puis,
Je t'ai trouvée, Gwen Cooper.
Salut, je suis Eugène Jones, je suis...
très intéressé par ton travail et...
J'ai quelque chose à...
Je voudrais te montrer...
Salut.
- Salut. Voilà c'est...
- Ecoute... je dois y aller.
Mais je n'arrivais pas vraiment
à établir le contact.
Hmm, encore toi.
Gwen, il y a quelque chose
que je dois vraiment te montrer.
Désolé, je voulais pas...
Mais je n'arrivais pas à t'intéresser
à l'oeil, malgré tous mes efforts.
Vous êtes sûrs que c'est mon Eugène ?
Oui, Mme Jones.
Vous n'avez peut-être pas pu
bien l'identifier.
Si.
C'est son thé là.
Merde !
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait là ?
Regarde ça.
Tu comprends ce qui est
arrivé à ton frère, Terry ?
Ouais.
Quoi ?
Il est allé sur la route
et quelqu'un l'a renversé.
Où est ton père ?
Il bosse pour une grosse
société aux Etats-Unis.
Gwen ?
C'est de la monnaie pre-Gorgon
Pilurian. Je les ai fait authentifier.
Ce sont des pièces romaines ?
Hé, regarde, Rice Krispies.
Mec, y'a du gros dossier par ici.
Oh, attendez, il manque
quelque chose ici.
Mme Jones, vous savez ce qui manque
dans la collection d'Eugène ?
Pourquoi ne se sont-ils pas arrêtés ?
Ils ont tué mon garçon
et continué leur route...
Pardon.
Je suis désolée, Mme Jones.
Je suis désolé, Maman. Mais...
On a la meilleure des équipes sur le
coup. Torchwood, moi, les meilleurs !
On classera l'affaire, Maman.
Je pense qu'il y a eu une erreur.
Alors...
Je dois y aller.
Je veux savoir la dernière chose
qu'il a mangé, où il a été...
Oh, ouah !
C'est... c'est...
Je suis totalement...
Dieu tout puissant !
Une tête de Vexor 11.
Incroyable !
Et... ouah !
Une main... dans un bocal.
Qu'est-ce qu'il
faisait sur cette route ?
J'en sais foutre rien. Il comptait
les chevrons. C'était un geek.
C'est vraiment légendaire.
Gwen, il avait un truc pour toi,
maintenant tu te sens coupable.
Va te faire foutre, Owen.
- Fais-le, alors.
- Faire quoi ? L'autopsie ?
- Oui. J'ai de la paperasse à faire.
- Ok, d'accord.
- Tu es sûre ?
- Oui.
- Vraiment ?
- Oui.
Je suis au paradis.
J'y suis ?
Est-ce que... ?
Lame numéro 3.
Part du sternum. Du gâteau.
Ok, c'est parti.
C'est nouveau pour moi, mais
dans une enquête comme ça...
D'accord.
Une Opel rouge a été arrêtée
près de Caernarfon.
L'homme, totalement saoul, a avoué
avoir renversé quelqu'un près de Cardiff.
Correspond à Eugène.
Il dit qu'il pensait qu'il
allait bien, alors il a continué.
C'était un mec charmant.
C'est très triste.
Bon, on se met au travail,
s'il te plaît ?
<i>Hope there's someone
who'll take care of me</i>
<i>When I die</i>
<i>Will I go ?</i>
<i>Hope there's someone
who'll set my heart free</i>
<i>Nice to hold when I'm tired</i>
<i>There's a ghost on the horizon</i>
<i>When I go to bed</i>
<i>How can I fall asleep at night ?</i>
<i>How will I rest my head ?</i>
<i>I'm scared of the middle place</i>
<i>Or paralyse in light</i>
<i>And godsend I don't want to go... </i>
Vous pensez qu'Eugène s'est suicidé ?
C'était un accident de voiture,
sans implication extra-terrestre.
J'en suis pas si sûre, il y
a quelque chose qui cloche.
Je veux dire, je...
je sens qu'il se passe quelque chose.
Génial. Merci pour ce moment
Disney. Qui prépare le thé ?
Je suppose qu'Eugène est un peu bizarre,
et fait amateur à tes yeux.
Pourquoi seule Gwen a l'air d'avoir
un coeur ? On est tous humains,
et pourtant on sait faire
la part des choses.
C'est bon, vous deux.
Ok, c'est bon, oublie.
Moi j'ai oublié.
C'est le DVD d'Eugène ?
Non.
Si !
- Il l'avait emprunté au vidéo club.
- Tu lui as piqué ses affaires ?
J'allais le rapporter.
- Je vais le faire.
- Ça me va.
Il faudra payer.
Je vais manger un bout.
D'accord.
Bonjour. Vous savez quand le
vidéo club au coin de la rue ouvre ?
- Non, il n'a pas d'horaires précises.
- Gwen ! Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
C'est mon café du midi. C'est...
Vous connaissez un certain
Eugène Jones ?
C'est moi !
Taille moyenne, cheveux blond.
Apparence ordinaire...
Non. Que puis-je faire pour vous ?
Je viens ici tous les jours.
Deux oeufs, jambon et frites.
Deux oeufs, jambon et frites,
s'il vous plaît.
Alors...
Alors...
C'est vraiment bizarre.
Avant, c'était moi qui te suivais.
Maintenant c'est toi qui me suis !
Ouais.
Je sais pas à qui elles sont.
Je ne me rappelle rien, sauf..
Appelle Gary.
Il saura peut-être quelque chose.
Appelle Gary, appelle Gary...
"Bonjour, c'est Gary.
Laissez un message, s'il vous plaît."
Bonjour, je suis Gwen Cooper.
J'ai de mauvaises nouvelles, Gary.
Je rappellerai plus tard.
C'est magnifique.
Bonjour.
Salut, ma belle.
Tu veux emprunter un rêve ?
Non, merci.
Je viens rendre des DVD au nom
d'une personne décédée.
Décédée ? Merde alors.
C'est radical.
Eugène Jones.
Oui, il venait souvent ici,
avec un pote.
- Un peu rêveur... plutôt...
- Irrésistible ?
- d'apparence ordinaire.
- Oui. Tué dans un accident de la route.
C'est dommage. Un garçon sympa.
- 50 €, s'il te plaît.
- 50 € ?
Oui, désolé, il les a gardés des lustres.
Je ne l'avais pas vu depuis des mois.
Je pense pas pouvoir enfreindre
les règles, juste parce qu'il est mort.
- Quel bâtard. Désolé, Gwen.
- C'est bon.
Est-ce qu'il... ?
Est-ce qu'il est allé sur la route
de lui-même ?
Beaucoup de gens viennent ici.
Ils ne veulent plus être
eux-mêmes, mais quelqu'un d'autre.
Ils veulent que je les fasse voyager.
- Et toi, bébé ?
- Laisse-la.
Ça va, merci.
- Et vous ?
- Moi ?
Je me casse d'ici. J'emménage à
Londres dans quelque mois, tu vois ?
Sans être irrespectueux, Eugène
avait "perdant" écrit sur le front.
Peut-être qu'il ne
supportait plus... son échec.
Tu payes par chèque ?
Echec ?
Est-ce vrai ? Ma vie n'a-t-elle
été qu'un grand échec ?
J'ai peut-être pas utilisé mon
potentiel de génie en maths,
mais j'attendais que l'alien vienne
récupérer son oeil et change ma vie.
Et en l'attendant, j'ai rejoint
les ventes par téléphone Passmore.
Oh, oui. Tout ça est bien trop familier.
Vendre des cuisines, des assurances vie,
des barbecues.
Vendre de la vie et...
continuer à attendre.
Jason !
Kevin ! Le mec aux problèmes
d'hygiène personnelle !
Rien ne change.
Salut, Morag.
Je suis sorti avec Morag.
Je me rappelle de détails de ma
passionnante vie quotidienne,
alors pourquoi les quelques heures
vitales précédant ma mort,
sont toujours un mystère complet ?
Vous êtes Gary ?
Oui, oui. Comment vous... ?
Vous êtes...
Gwen, oui. Avez-vous vu
Eugène le jour de sa mort ?
Non. Désolé.
On écrit une carte, vous savez...
"Bonne chance pour ton
nouveau boulot" ?! Il est mort.
Non ! C'est pour qui, alors ?
- Sa mère, espèce d'idiot !
- Merde !
- Tu peux l'effacer ?
- C'est du stylo !
- Les gens ne comprennent rien.
- T'inquiète pas, c'est bon.
C'est vrai ?
- Il s'est fait renverser ?
- Oui.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Désolée. Je suis Linda.
Je suis employée du mois.
Il suffit d'y croire, vous savez.
S'il le faut, je suis
"Cuisines pour une Vie".
Eugène n'était jamais que lui-même.
C'était pas le meilleur vendeur, alors ?
Non. Je crois que Craig le gardait
par bonté de coeur.
- Vous avez rencontré Craig ?
- C'est votre patron ?
Vous êtes ensemble ?
Un baiser dans les toilettes des
femmes à la fête de Noël.
Mais je ne peux pas en parler
ici à cause de sa... position.
Vous voulez qu'on en parle
devant un déjeuner ?
Ok. Où Gary s'assoit-il ?
- Numéro 50.
- Ok, merci.
Owen ?
<i>Gwen, Jack veut savoir où tu es.</i>
Oui, désolée.
J'avais des trucs à régler.
Je reviens plus tard.
<i>Ok, dépêche toi.
Un jour, Eugène est arrivé,
plutôt abattu.
Pourquoi ? Qu'est-ce qu'il avait ?
Il ne voulait pas en parler.
Enfin, j'étais aussi énervée car
Craig avait...
Enfin bref,
j'ai dit que j'adorerais m'éloigner
de tout ça et partir en Australie.
Eugène est devenu très enthousiaste,
il m'a dit "Oui ! Tu dois y aller !"
Je lui ai dit "Mais je n'ai pas l'argent",
et il a dit qu'il me le trouverait.
Il allait vous payer un billet
pour partir en Australie avec vous ?
Il était amoureux de vous ?
Oh, non ! Il disait aimer quelqu'un
qu'il ne pouvait pas atteindre.
Il voulait juste s'occuper de moi.
Il m'a dit,
"Ne reste pas ici à gâcher ta vie, attendant
ce qui n'arrivera peut-être jamais."
- Où comptait-il trouver l'argent ?
- Justement.
Tu m'as dit "Tu n'as même pas
acheté de chaussettes en six ans."
Je lui ai dit "Tu n'as même pas acheté
de nouvelles chaussettes en six ans."
Il s'est levé, et a dit :
C'est votre téléphone.
- Oui, il a dit ?
- Il a dit
"Je vais le vendre"
J'ai dit "Quoi ?"
Il a dit, "Mon artefact alien."
- Et ?
- Et ?
Et il l'a amené au boulot.
- C'est un oeil en plastique.
- C'est une partie d'un corps d'alien,
et je vais le vendre sur eBay.
C'est vraiment gentil, mais je pense
pas qu'il me payerait un ticket de bus,
encore moins un vol pour Sydney.
Certains ont ri. Mais il l'a fait, et
bien-sûr, il n'y avait pas d'enchères.
Elle m'a conseillé de mettre une
photo, un peu plus de description.
Et puis, sorti de nulle part, 4 €.
Un gamin de Birmingham.
Et puis...
Eugène, t'as quelques
nouvelles enchères.
Bon sang, 100 € !
C'était juste le début.
300... 450...
1500... Ça continuait à monter.
4500 € ! Pour un oeil de rechange.
Pete dit qu'on peut avoir une salle de
bain avec une célébrité pour moins que ça.
Et puis un jour, ça a...
sauté.
Oh mon Dieu, Eugène, tu es riche !
22 050,50 €.
- Qui l'a acheté ?
- Qui l'a acheté ?
Aucune idée. Tout est de ma faute ?
Bien sûr que non !
Excusez-moi.
- Allô ?
- Bonjour, c'est la mère d'Eugène.
- Mme Jones ?
- J'ai quelque chose à vous montrer.
Ok, je vais passer.
C'était la mère d'Eugène.
Désolée, je vais devoir y aller.
Désolée.
<I>Le voilà... mon fils, à la finale inter
scolaire de maths. Un grand moment.
<i>Le plus jeune participant
du pays de Galles.
<i>Nous y voilà, dernière question
qui clôturera la finale.
<i>Quelle courbe est représentée par
y au carré = 4ax ?
<i>T'as le cerveau de la taille du Grand
Parc de Cardiff ! C'est quoi le problème ! ?
<i>Quelle courbe est représentée
par y au carré = 4ax ?
<i> Me fait pas ça.
<i>Me laisse pas tomber, fiston.
<i>Non ?
<i>Temps écoulé.
Pas de points additionnels.
<i>Le score final est de...
Je ne comprend pas. Quelqu'un lui
a donné l'oeil pour le consoler ?
Oui, ce M. Garrett, le
professeur de sciences.
Un oeil en plastique !
Comme prix de consolation !
- Enfin, le trésor d'Eugène.
- C'est la nuit où Papa est parti.
En voyage.
- Tu peux arrêter maintenant, Maman.
- Comment ça ?
Il est mort.
Il pouvait calculer la racine
carré d'une racine,
mais pas traverser la route !
S'il te plaît !
Il a vendu l'oeil sur internet.
Quelque chose a dû se passer.
Papa est parti quand il a vu qu'Eugène
était un raté. C'est ce qu'Eugène a dit.
C'est pas vrai. Rien de ça ne l'est.
Il est parti pour son boulot.
Il a un boulot très important.
Est-ce que M. Jones sait pour Eugène ?
En fait, il travaille pour
une grosse société en Amérique.
Arrête de nous dire n'imp !
C'est pas superman, Maman !
Il travaille dans un garage sur Filey.
Eugene l'a trouvé il y a deux semaines !
Il l'a trouvé sur internet.
Il est caissier. Il travaille de nuit.
Oh, mon dieu, je me rappelle
pourquoi j'ai vendu l'oeil.
La vie peut vraiment être vache.
Toutes ces années, j'ai cru que mon père
était en Amérique car j'étais un raté.
Et il était là, à faire son travail secret
super important sur Filey, à Cardiff.
Quand je l'ai trouvé, je ne pouvais
même pas supporter de lui dire bonjour.
J'avais passé ma vie à croire en des
histoires ridicules, des fantaisies.
J'avais gâché ma vie.
Maintenant que je l'avais vu là,
tous mes rêves ne valaient plus rien.
Juste un tas de merde, y compris l'oeil.
Alors pourquoi pas le vendre ?
Avec le traitement anti-cafard
et les isolants pour grenier,
et toutes les autres merdes
qui flottent dans notre monde.
Linda avait bien besoin d'argent.
Non ! NON ! Fais pas ça, Gwen !
Je ne veux rien avoir à faire avec lui.
Désolé.
C'est bon.
Tu as éteint ton portable.
C'était Eugène.
Il n'avait pas compris
pourquoi son père était parti.
Il a juste besoin d'un peu d'aide.
- Pour faire quoi ? Il est mort !
- Oui, Jack, je sais qu'il est mort, mais...
Ça ne sonne pas bien, Gwen.
- J'ai du travail.
- D'accord.
Eh ? Non, tu peux pas t'arrêter.
Et les 22 000 € ?
Gwen ? Gwen !
Ok. Ecoute ça.
Eugène avait un oeil alien dans sa
collection. Il l'a vendu sur internet.
Quoi, comme un sixième oeil ?
Un sixième oeil de Dogon ?
Peut-être.
C'est possible. Il y en avait
un commerce.
Qui l'a ?
Je sais pas, mais je m'en approche.
Qu'est-ce que c'est, un
sixième oeil ? Exactement ?
Un oeil dans le dos. Ca te permet de
voir derrière toi, là d'où tu viens.
Ça met un peu les choses en perspective.
C'est utile, marrant, assez terrifiant,
c'est pour ça qu'ils
étaient très demandés.
- Tu vois ? Je te l'avais dit.
- Je peux te le récupérer.
Mon alien...
Tu vois ?
Ok, je te laisse le week-end.
Mais laisse ton portable allumé.
Bon sang, tu es géniale.
Et je suis génial aussi.
Oui, bien sûr, j'allais aller à la
conférence à Abertystwyth avec Gary.
Les trous noirs et l'anti-matière étaient
très importants pour Gary et moi, mais
si je dois passer une nuit en bord de
mer, je sais avec qui je préfère être.
Je laisserais ma vie entre tes mains
tu sais, si... j'en avais encore une.
Gary ?
Je ne suis pas fier
de ce que j'ai fait.
- Tu as augmenté les enchères ?
- J'ai créé 3 ou 4 comptes différents,
pour faire augmenter le prix.
Mais pourquoi ?
Au début, pour lui remonter le
moral. Il était vraiment déprimé.
Mais ensuite les enchères se sont
envolées et on a été...
Je veux dire, j'étais impliqué au départ,
J'aidais juste Eugène à se faire
de l'argent, et puis un matin...
Gary !
Gary...
je crois que c'est lui.
- Qui ?
- L'alien.
Mon alien.
Je pense qu'il est revenu
réclamer ce qui lui revient de droit.
Gary, j'avais cessé de croire en lui,
je croyais que j'étais juste un nul.
Mais qui d'autre parierait autant
d'argent pour un oeil prothétique ?
Il n'a pas pu me contacter autrement.
- Alors il a choisi eBay ?
- Le Cyber espace.
Même une vente aux enchères sur le net
a une certaine symétrie élégante.
Je crois que je vais finalement
le rencontrer.
Je doutais pas mal, au début, mais
tout à coup, sorti de nulle part, bam !
22 000. L'enchère a sauté à
un putain de 22 000.
Oui, oui, je me rappelle
de notre conversation.
Je croyais que c'était 22050,50 €.
Oui, ça l'était.
Je dépenserai pas tout mon argent,
à moins que ce ne soit une propre
partie de mon corps. Vous le feriez ?
Non.
Pas question !
Je m'en rappelle, oui.
J'ai attendu quelques jours puis j'ai
eu un mail pour un rendez-vous dans...
un restaurant.
Vous avez vu Eugène le
jour de sa mort, non ?
Oui, on s'est vus avant qu'il
aille rencontrer l'alien.
On a pris un café.
Il avait peur.
Ah bon ? Bien sûr que je l'étais.
Il est donc allé faire l'échange:
22050,50 € pour l'oeil, c'est ça ?
- Et c'était près de l'A48 ?
- Ou pas.
Ou pas ?
Eugène était très secret.
- C'était peut- être à Splott ?
- Splott ?
Ça sonne pas bien, mec.
Qui étaient ces autres gens, Gary ?
Pourquoi Eugène prendrait-il
une photo de vos chaussures ?
Et à qui sont les autres ?
Ce sont juste des chaussures
comme ça, je pense.
Il me manque.
Oui, je m'en rappelle ! J'ai appelé un
taxi, et j'ai mis l'oeil dans un sac congel
Et puis... Oui ! Je marchais
le long de la route vers...
un immeuble brillant avec...
une grande porte qui parlait de...
de...
Bonheur.
Bonheur.
Je ne veux pas que tu découvres
ce qui s'est passé.
Je ne veux pas que ça s'arrête.
Je t'aime.
Je t'aime.
Je croyais qu'on était en vacances.
Oui.
Oui... c'est ça.
J'ai remonté la colline, et il
était là ! Le...
Le Bonheur de la Cuisine.
Oui, j'ai marché vers la porte,
me demandant qui j'allais rencontrer
assez excité, plutôt stressé,
franchement mort de peur.
J'ai ouvert la porte...
Je suis entré...
et j'ai vu...
Je cherche des chaussures
comme ça depuis des lustres.
Et j'ai vu...
Et j'ai vu... mes potes.
Salut les mecs. Content de vous voir.
Mais...
j'ai rendez-vous.
C'est nous.
Je sais mais...
il ne voudra pas trop de monde.
Je rencontre l'acheteur.
- Je rencontre l'alien.
- On est l'alien, mec.
On l'a acheté.
- Quoi ?
- Voilà.
Que prendrez vous ?
Un milk-shake, s'il vous plaît. Banane.
Oui. On est les acheteurs officiels.
Peut-on voir la marchandise ?
Je ne comprend pas trop ce
que vous essayez de me dire.
C'était une blague pour
te remonter le moral.
On ne pensait pas qu'on serait les acheteurs.
Puis il a dit que tu croyais que
c'était l'alien, et on s'est dit...
c'est drôle, non ?
Allez, Eugène, redescend sur terre.
Et puis on s'est dit
"Laisse le rêver, mec."
"La vie est courte
est vraiment chiante."
On a continué à enchérir et...
Vous avez mis 22 000 pour l'oeil ?
Pas nous. Non. Sûrement pas.
Quelqu'un était vraiment intéressé.
Quelqu'un d'autre a parié les
22 000, mais il a été gourmand.
Ketchup, s'il te plaît.
 Il n'a pas pu résister à
enchérir un tout petit peu.
22050,50 €. Et puis, rien.
Nada. Finito.
Ok, ferme-la, Gary.
Donc, on l'a acheté.
On est les acheteurs.
Ta-dah !
Alors vous avez 22050,50 € sur vous ?
On a 50 €.
50 €, Eugène. C'est mieux que rien.
J'appelle un taxi.
Hé, calme toi.
- Milk-shake à la banane ?
- Merci.
Si c'était qu'une mauvaise blague,
alors pourquoi vous le voulez ?
J'ai un ami déficient visuel.
Vous allez le re-vendre en ligne, non ?
Bande de petits connards.
Vous savez qu'il est là.
- Qui ?
- L'alien,
et il payerait n'importe quel prix.
Eugène, je ne suis pas totalement
fermé à la science-fiction, mais...
Un vieux mec vert à six yeux ?
Redescend sur terre, mec.
J'ai vérifié l'historique des enchères.
M. C Blackstaff est collectionneur
d'objets alien et de souvenirs Nazi.
Et de jouets pour bébés.
Un tout petit peu dérangé,
mais extrêmement riche.
Et si il veut bien payer 22 000...
Hé !
Alors ils ont commencé
à déranger les clients.
- Vous êtes intervenue ?
- J'ai essayé.
Je ne savais plus vraiment
ce qu'était l'oeil...
..mais jamais je ne le laisserai pour
50 € et un milk-shake à la banane.
Heimlich ! Heimlich !
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Je reprend notre bien, idiot !
Apporte le milk-shake.
Ce n'est pas un comportement acceptable.
Pas au Bonheur de la Cuisine. Ils
se donnaient totalement en spectacle.
Et c'est tout, il a pris la porte, parti.
Oh mon Dieu ! C'est vraiment bizarre !
Bande de bâtards ! Vous êtes morts !
Je veux dire, Josh, t'es qu'une tête
de cul, mais Gary...
- On était... on était amis.
- Salut poupée.
C'est à moi que tu parles ?
Oui.
Désolé. Tu te rappelle de nous,
la semaine dernière ?
Oui.
Bon, voilà le truc, des gens pourraient
venir poser des questions.
Une femme, spécialement.
Et je pense...
Josh.
- Qu'il serait dans ton intérêt...
- Ferme-la, Josh.
La nana coopère, mec !
D'accord.
Génial.
Pourquoi t'as fait ça, sale con ?
Il me manque !
Il est sorti en courant et vous l'avez
poursuivi, tous les deux ?
Oui.
A travers le parking.
Mais Eugène allait vite.
Josh avait de nouvelles chaussures,
il faisait des histoires...
Hé, hé, c'est toi qui est en surpoids.
Il a foncé vers la route, et on l'a perdu.
Je dis la vérité.
Ok.
C'est tout.
Ok.
Toutes ces voitures. Toutes
ces vies bougeant dans l'espace.
Bonjour. Pouvez vous me donner le
numéro du Garage Filey, à Cardiff ?
Toutes cette humanité bourdonnant,
dans une frénésie de frites et hamburgers,
du bonheur des vacances, de pneus
crevés, de cris d'enfants...
- et de soudaines crises cardiaques.
- Passez-le moi, merci.
M. Jones ?
Vous ne me connaissez pas, mais
je suis une amie de votre fils Eugène.
J'ai bien peur d'avoir de
mauvaises nouvelles.
Maintenant, je me rappelle.
A part un bruit dans l'oreille, car
Josh m'avait frappé, je me sentais bien.
Je courrais dans un
champ en un Samedi matin.
L'odeur d'échappement et de
milk-shake à la banane,
une légère nausée, le coeur battant
trop vite car je ne suis pas sportif...
tout ce qui vous montre
que vous êtes en vie...
Logiquement, j'aurais dû être
vraiment énervé.
Mes potes m'avaient menti,
je n'avais rencontré aucun alien,
mais j'ai réalisé, en avalant l'oeil
au Bonheur de la Cuisine,
qu'on me donnait une chance
de regarder ma vie
et de la voir pour ce
qu'elle était vraiment.
Gary, tu vas me manquer.
C'est pas la meilleure fin possible,
mais quand même.
J'aimerais pouvoir...
Mon Dieu, Gwen, j'aimerais
pouvoir te remercier.
Et le voilà...
mon père,
avec seulement 14 ans de retard.
Je sais maintenant qu'il n'est
pas parti à cause de moi,
et bien sûr, qu'il n'était pas Superman,
ni un alien.
Juste un mec ordinaire.
Eugène...
C'était un bon garçon,
mais je ne sais comment...
les choses ont mal tourné.
Je n'ai pas été là.
J'aurais aimé le voir... avant...
Un mec ordinaire qui avait foiré.
<i>Oh, Danny Boy</i>
<i>The pipes, the pipes are calling</i>
<i>From glen to glen and
down the mountainside</i>
<i>The summer's gone and
all the flowers dying</i>
<i>Tis you must go and I must stay behind</i>
<i>But come ye back</i>
<i>When summer's in the meadow</i>
<i>Or when the valley's</i>
<i>Hushed and white with snow</i>
<i>And I'll be there</i>
<i>In sunshine</i>
<i>And in shadow...</i>
Non !
Pas encore.
Papa avait tout foiré et était parti.
Et c'est vraiment honteux,
terriblement dommage,
parce qu'on s'est manqués.
Totalement.
Tu sais, 28 est un de
ses nombres parfaits,
égale à la somme de ses diviseurs.
J'ai 28 ans.
J'avais 28 ans.
Je crois que je vais bientôt
devoir partir, Gwen.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Ouais.
28 centimètres par seconde est aussi
la vitesse maximum d'un homard.
Oh, bonjour.
Merci. Désolée de vous
avoir demandé ça.
Pas de problème.
Si c'est l'oeil qui me gardait ici,
maintenant qu'il n'est plus en moi,
pourquoi suis-je toujours là ?
Eugène ?
L'oeil est dans un sac,
maintenant, plutôt qu'en toi.
Est-ce que... ?
- Salut, étrangère ! Tu l'as ?
- Oui, je l'ai.
Impressionnant.
On a pas encore fait les tests, alors...
Viens. On doit y aller.
Jack, tu peux me
laisser cinq minutes ?
Oui.
En un temps de vie moyen, le coeur
humain bats 2 millions de fois.
On produit plus de 8000 gallons
de salive et 550 km de cheveux.
On mange l'équivalent du
poids de six éléphants.
Oh, la vie n'est- elle
pas géniale ! Gwen !
GWEN !
GWEN !
Salut.
Oh mon Dieu.
- Eugène !
- Ça va ?
Ça fait du bien de te voir.
Eugène, tu es sur ma jambe.
- Désolé ! Désolé.
- Non, non, c'est bon.
C'est bon. C'est bon. C'est bon.
Il peut me voir ?
- Eugène...
- Il peut me voir !
Merci.
Non, merci à toi. Merci. Tu
viens de me sauver la vie.
C'est bon.
C'est incroyable. C'est
totalement incroyable.
Oh, mon Dieu...
Je crois que ça y est.
Adieu, Gwen.
Ne pars pas maintenant, Eugène.
Eugène, ne pars pas
maintenant, s'il te plaît.
Eugène, s'il te plaît...
S'il te plaît !
Une vie moyenne est pleine de buts
manqués et de réussites absolues,
de grand amour et de petits désastres.
C'est fait de milk-shakes à la
banane, d'isolement de grenier
et de chaussures aléatoires.
C'est totalement ordinaire,
et vraiment, vraiment génial.
Vous devez réaliser que
tout est là, maintenant.
Alors respirez profondément
et avalez tout ça.
Parce que croyez moi, la vie ne fait que
passer, et puis, tout à coup, c'est...
Au moins c'était pas un
vaisseau plein d'aliens.
Quelle année ? Je dois savoir.
1953.
Juste trois personnes perdues, qui
sont devenues notre responsabilité.
Un homme comme vous, hors
de son temps, seul et apeuré.
Je déteste cet endroit puant !
- Je suis mort une fois.
- C'est comme deux mondes séparés.
Il y a Torchwood... et puis la vraie vie.
J'ai peur.

Menottes.
Allez, rendons ça facile pour nous deux.
Ca arrive toujours quand
je leur laisse la nuit.
Ce n'est même pas à point, encore
moins bien cuit. Ces français...
Tu te souviens ce week-end à Paris,
l'endroit avec les panneaux de bois
ils avaient même pas encore mis le
steak sous le grill que tu as dit...
- Pourquoi tu me regardes comme ça ?
- Pardon, comme quoi ?
Comme si tu préférerais que
je sois quelqu'un d'autre.
Ca devient normal, hein ? Je débite,
je lève les yeux et tu es juste absente.
- Qu'est-ce qui nous arrive, Gwen ?
- Je sais. Je suis désolée.
C'est quelque chose que j'ai fait ?
Ou pas fait ?
Bon sang, qu'est-ce que c'était ?
- Oh mon Dieu, qu'est ce qui t'est arrivé ?
- Rhys, c'est ça ? Enchanté !
Désolé, c'est une urgence, je la
ramène pour le dessert. Viens...
- Attendez, c'est ma copine.
- Rhys, c'est Jack.
Assieds-toi, Gwen.
- C'est mon patron.
- Assieds-toi, putain !
Ne me parle plus jamais comme ça.
Allez, Gwen. Allons-y.
Hé, elle est avec moi ce soir.
Une nuit entière. Tu m'as promis.
Tu n'oseras pas.
Si tu pars maintenant, Gwen... !
Désolé de vous avoir interrompus,mais j'ai
quelques soucis avec celui-là.
Rhys survivra. Comme d'habitude.
Tu as promis que tu
continuerais à garder ta vie.
Ne la laisse pas te
glisser entre les doigts.
300 m sur la droite, au parking !
Jack ! Par ici !
Faites-le monter, faites-le monter !!
- Putain ils sont fous !
- Hé !
Mais qui sont-ils, bordel ?!

Primo : depuis quand d'autres
gens connaissent les Weevils ?
Deuxio : ont-ils déjà fait ça et
si oui, pourquoi on ne l'a pas su ?
Tertio : qu'est-ce qu'ils
veulent en faire de toute façon ?
Peut être aucun lien, mais
on a remarqué un déferlement
de blessures étranges
reportées par les secours.
Morceaux retirés des jambes et des bras,
blessures profondes au dos et à l'estomac.
Alors, on a une vague d'attaques
Weevil à ajouter à nos problèmes.
Et d'ailleurs, le spray qu'on
utilisait contre eux auparavant ?
Ils deviennent immunisés contre lui.
- Ils mutent ?
- Ou évoluent.
Alors, une piste sur celui
que nous avons perdu plus tôt ?
J'ai traqué la plaque d'immatriculation
du van. Elle est fausse.
2500 vans de ce type ont été
enregistré dans la zone de Cardiff.
Elargi ça à un rayon de
60 km et le nombre double.
- Lance une poursuite sur le véhicule.
- Cameras de circulation ?
<i>C'est la messagerie d'Owen,
laissez un message si nécessaire.</i>
Je lance la recherche.
<i>Laissez un message pour Gwen et
Rhys, et on vous rappellera...</i>
<i>- Si on s'en souvient...
- Hé !</i>
Salut, c'est moi. Ca fait 3
messages que je laisse maintenant.
Ecoute, j'ai une
douzaine d'excuses, hum...
<i>des centaines. Des milliers !</i>
<i>Mais aucune d'elle n'est assez bonne.</i>
Les choses m'ont un peu échappé récemment.
<i>C'est ce boulot. Ca ne
veut jamais s'arrêter.</i>
Ecoute, je te vois plus tard. Je ne sais
pas encore exactement à quelle heure.
J'ai du boulot à finir d'abord.
Appelle-moi.
<i>Message supprimé.</i>
Allez vous répondre à ça ?
9ème appel en absence : Travail.
Vous aimez votre boulot alors ?
Ecoutez, si ça ne vous dérange
pas... Je préfère être seul.
Ah, la vieille Greta Garbo.
Dans ce genre là.
Petit conseil : la prochaine fois
que vous vous sentez comme ça,
vous devriez rester.
Faites-moi confiance, plus la foule
est grande, plus je me sens seul.
J'ai dit : ne pas draguer les parieurs.
Tommy, je travaille dans un bar.
C'est mon boulot de leur parler.
Tu n'es jamais aussi contente que quand
tu montres tes nichons à un trou du cul.
Ne lui parlez pas comme ça.
- Quoi ?
- On avait une conversation.
Un jour, quand tu grandiras, tu réaliseras
que c'est ce que les êtres humain font.
Tommy, arrête. Tu vas me faire virer !
Tu vois, c'est l'art d'utiliser l'agression
de ton adversaire à tes propres fins.
Maintenant, je te conseillerai de ne pas
commencer de bagarres avec des étrangers.
Et vous devriez vraiment
mettre à jour votre petit-ami.
Qu'est ce qu'un homme doit faire pour
avoir un peu la paix dans cette ville ?
Owen ne répond toujours
pas à son téléphone.
Il est plus capricieux que d'habitude
depuis cette histoire avec Diane.
Depuis quoi ?
C'est pas mes affaires.
Quelle histoire ?
Quelle histoire, Tosh ?
Owen et Diane.
Avant qu'elle prenne l'avion,
ils ont eu un... truc.
- Tu le savais, non ?
- Oh, ouais, bien sûr que je le savais.
Je ne savais juste pas
qu'ils avaient eu un truc...
truc.
Ca a commencé il y a 10 minutes.
Qu'est-ce que tu crois qu'il fait ?
- Je pense qu'il pleure.
- Pourquoi ?
Owen étudie celui-là,
il pense qu'ils ont un faible
niveau de capacité télépathique,
pour partager leur émotions
à travers la distance.
Tu veux dire qu'il ressent peut-être
la douleur d'un autre Weevil ?
J'espère cependant qu'on a tort.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que ça voudrait dire que ces gens
ne capturent pas seulement les Weevils,
ils leur font du mal.
Qu'est-ce que tu ressens ?
Qu'est-ce que tu sais ?
J'ai suivi l'itinéraire du van. Il
est allé droit du parking aux docks.
C'était il y a 2 heures.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
- Les cameras de la CCTV se sont arrêtés.
- Tu crois que c'était voulu ?
Je pense que ces gars n'aiment
vraiment pas être observés.
Tu vois, je sais que c'est
la faiblesse du personnage...
qui me rend le plus déterminé
à découvrir ce qu'ils y cachent.
On dirait qu'on les a loupés.
Ouais, mais si tu quittes
les lieux subitement,
tu as tendance à être tête en l'air.
Tu sais pourquoi ils utilisaient ces
entrepôts pendant la 2eme Guerre Mondiale ?
Pour conserver les corps des soldats morts.
Parfois, tu peux trop connaître l'histoire.
Viens.
Il n'y a rien ici.
Alors qu'est-ce qu'ils faisaient là ?
Pourquoi faire tout ce chemin ?
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Ca a l'air humain.
Masculin.
- Il est vivant ?
- Hé ho ?
Vous allez bien ?
On cherche les gens qui
étaient ici la nuit dernière !
Si vous avez vu quelque chose,
c'est le bon moment pour parler.
Jack, il saigne.
- Oh, mon Dieu !
- Griffes de Weevils.
Tu ne crois pas qu'il est encore là ?
Non. On l'aurait entendu.
Aide-moi avec le corps.
C'est la sienne ?
Tu ne crois pas que j'aurais
choisi cette sonnerie ?
Ne réponds pas.
- Allô ?
- Je ne sais pas qui vous êtes.
<i>Mais restez en dehors de
ce qui ne vous regarde pas.</i>
- Qui a tué cet homme ?
- Avez-vous entendu ce que j'ai dit ?
J'ai cette surdité sélective quand
je parle aux lâches ou aux meurtriers.
<i>N'interférez pas dans des
choses que vous ne comprenez pas.</i>
Oh, je comprends ça mieux que vous.
Car je sais comment ça va finir.
On va vous chasser.
On va s'assurer que vous soyez
puni pour ce que vous avez fait ici.
Et on va vous faire rendre cette
créature que vous avez kidnappée.
C'est assez clair ?
Ianto ? J'ai besoin que tu traces tous les
appels de ce numéro dans les dernières 24h.
Aussi vite que possible. On rentre.
C'est la messagerie d'Owen.
Ne laissez pas de message.
<i>Bien essayé, Owen. Je veux que tu
rentres au Centre immédiatement.</i>
<i>On a un meurtre de Weevil, alors
ramène ton petit cul ici maintenant.</i>
Dan Hodges, date de
naissance, 21 Janvier 1979.
Vendeur pour une boîte de
logiciel d'éditions sur Internet.
On dirait qu'il était
marié, avec un enfant.
Ouais, sans aucun doute, Sherlock.
Bien, bel et bien tué par un Weevil,
mais il a reçu un bon coup de pied
avant que la gorge soit éclatée.
Les Weevils tuent généralement,
directement par la jugulaire.
Regardez sa tête : oeil au beurre noir,
des bleus sur les pommettes.
La même chose sur le dos et les côtes.
- Il aurait pu être torturé ?
- Peut-être.
Mais je pense que ces blessures
ont été infligées par des humains.
Mais pourquoi frapper les gens et
après jeter un Weevil sur eux ?
Pourquoi ne pas laisser le Weevil
faire tout le boulot pour toi ?
Alors, ce téléphone ?
Le dernier appel entrant était masqué.
L'historique des appels a été effacé.
Ils agissent rapidement.
Ces gars utilisent les Weevils
pour accomplir le meurtre parfait.
Pas d'empreintes, aucunes
traces d'ADN reconnaissables...
une mort rapide, et guarantie...
Rien pour lier qui
que ce soit au meurtre.
Bien. Ca va être du gateau
de trouver le tueur, alors.
Et pour ce gars ? Quelqu'un doit
dire à sa femme qu'il est mort.
La partie la plus chiante pour un
flic et je ne peux pas me dérober.
Merci pour tes quelques mots de soutien.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux que je te dise ?
Que ça ira bien en fin de compte ?
Tu peux toujours compter sur
Owen pour te sentir mieux.
Tosh a mentionné Diane et toi...
Avez-vous...
Je ne voulais pas qu'elle
parte. Elle est partie.
Pourquoi on continue à faire ça,
toi et moi ?
Bien. Arrêtons. Je commence à me lasser
de tes pirouettes sexuelles, de toute façon.
Tu peux être un sacré connard
parfois, Owen, tu sais ça ?
Oui, en fait.
T'étais passé où, bon sang ?
Je marchais.
Et bien, pendant ton absence,
Toshiko a eu une idée géniale.
Et bien, ça devait
arriver un jour ou l'autre.
Ignore-le, Tosh.
Ouais, ignore-moi, Tosh.
Je peux être un sacré
connard. Apparemment.
Le van avec le Weevil est
allé droit vers les entrepôts.
Ils devaient savoir qu'il était vide.
Soit ils leur appartiennent, soit ils ont
des relations avec les agents immobiliers.
Owen Harper, tu y vas
en tant que société.
Toshiko est en train
de régler ta couverture.
Attendez, pourquoi moi ?
Jack et Gwen étaient au
parking, j'étais aux entrepôts.
S'ils ont accès à la CCTV,
ils nous reconnaitront.
Nous devons passer sous leur garde,
pour découvrir ce qui se passe.
Ouais, d'accord.
Ca me dérange pas d'être
quelqu'un d'autre en ce moment.
- M. Harper ?
- Oui.
Mark Lynch.
Vous cherchez à relocaliser
votre société à Cardiff ?
Oui.
Et vous exportez de la
gelée d'anguille. Vraiment ?
Enorme marché grandissant.
Chine, Amérique du Sud, j'essaye tant bien
que mal d'aller aussi vite que la demande.
Je... vous en donnerai un lot si
vous me trouvez la bonne pêche.
Je pense que ça ira.
De la famille à déménager ?
Juste moi. C'est mieux comme ça.
Et vous cherchez des
locaux près des docks.
Hum, principalement de
grands entrepôts sympas.
J'ai quelques emplacements
qui devraient faire l'affaire.
- Attendez pendant l'impression.
- Merci.
On est dedans ! Ca va nous copier tout
son disque dur, même les fichiers protégés.
Si je peux établir un protocole
de route, quoi qu'il fera sur
son ordinateur à partir de
maintenant, on sera mis au courant.
Owen, c'est bon.
Voici les surfaces que vous cherchez,
bon accès, prix compétitifs...
Sauf...
qu'elles m'ont toutes l'air de poubelles.
Oui.
Un peu.
N'est-ce pas votre pancarte
sur la façade d'un grand entrepôt
dans la section Q des docks ?
Nous avons accepté une offre pour
celui-là. A peu près signé et clos.
<i>Il ment.</i>
D'après nos enregistrements, il a seulement
été mis sur le marché la semaine dernière.
Quelle poisse.
Pourquoi pas une celulle ou
une propriété industrielle ?
Vous sauvez une bonne partie du loyer,
même après le coût des transports.
Et vous vous avérez juste avoir une
liste de locaux appropriés ? Nan.
Il y a d'autres possibilités.
Vous êtes libre en fin de journée ?
Oui.
Voudriez-vous prendre un verre ?
Seul dans une ville étrange.
Je me souviens de ce sentiment.
Regardez-vous maintenant.
Quelques oiseaux splendides
répondant au téléphone pour vous.
Si ce n'est pas le succès,
je sais pas ce que c'est !
Que des foutaises, vraiment.
Mais si vous voulez que je
parle de vous autour de moi...
Non.
Merci.
Heureux de vous avoir rencontré, Mark.
Oui. Je vous passerai un coup de fil.
D'abord, il googlera
son nom sur Internet...
Ensuite il voudra savoir ce que
les gens disent de la société.
Maintenant il verra ce que
Owen dit à propos de lui-même.
<i>Bienvenue chez le fournisseur

<i>de Grande Bretagne et
du Nord de l'Europe.</i>
<i>Avec un client basé sur

Désolé, faux numéro.
Travail fini.
J'ai trouvé d'autres lots de
blessures suspectes à l'hôpital.
Elles ont l'air plutôt mauvaises.
Tosh, reste ici et surveille
les mouvements de Mark Lynch.
- Ianto avec moi...
- Je viens avec toi.
Rentre chez toi... Ce
n'est pas négociable.
Souviens-toi. Ne laisse
pas ça t'échapper.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Tu es là maintenant, hein ?
- C'est ton haut sexy.
- Non.
- Si !
C'est comme ça que tu l'appelles, depuis
que j'ai dit que tu étais sexy dedans.
- Tu sors ?
- Oui, Daf enterre sa vie de garçon.
- Toute une journée de travail.
- Depuis quand Daf va se marier ?
Il ne se marie pas. Mais il trouve
qu'il fait pas assez la fête.
Il est en période Rester Célibataire.
Quelques bières, on voit ce qui transpire.
Club de strip-tease, ce genre de choses.
A quelle heure tu rentres ?
Je suis pas sûr.
- Mais... je suis là ce soir.
- Et bien, pas moi.
J'ai déjà fait ma
déposition à la police.
Selon votre dossier médical,
vous avez presque eu votre coeur
arraché de votre cage thoracique.
10 heures d'opération pour réparer
les blessures de votre poitrine.
Pourquoi devrais-je vous parler ?
Laissez-moi vous dire
ce qui vous a fait ça.
1 m 80 de haut, dents
comme un requin, peau ondulée
et la fureur d'un animal sauvage.
J'en suis loin ?
J'ai été aggressé.
Ils étaient trois...
ils avaient des couteaux.
Alors pourquoi les secours ont décrits
vos blessures comme des morsures ?
Ecoutez, j'y peux rien
s'ils se sont trompés.
Ils sont surmenés.
Bon, j'ai plusieurs moyens
pour vous faire parler
mais le plus simple serait que vous pensiez
aux conséquences si jamais vous me mentez.
Et c'est que,
cette créature attaquera à nouveau.
Quelqu'un mourra.
Et ça sera sur votre conscience.
- Maintenant dites-nous la vérité.
- Je peux pas.
Ils me tueront.
- Qui vous tuera ?
- Tout le monde.
Qu'est ce qu'il veut
dire par "tout le monde" ?
C'est tout ce qu'il a dit. On
pouvait rien en tirer d'autre.
Ca nous laisse une seule option.
D'accord, Janet. C'est
l'heure de la promenade.
- Tu l'appelles Janet ?
- Barbara ne m'a jamais semblé bien.
Tu veux relâcher un Weevil
dans le centre de Cardiff ?!
Pas exactement au centre.
Un peu sur le côté.
On a placé un traqueur sur son bleu
de travail, quand ils le captureront,
on saura exactement où ils sont.
Il pourrait tuer
plusieurs personnes avant !
Je suis avec Tosh si tu me
dis pas ce que tu veux faire.
On le place au même endroit
où ils ont pris l'autre.
C'est désert à cette heure de la nuit.
On sera avec lui à
chaque pas qu'il fera.
- Le traqueur fonctionne ?
- Ouais.
Vas-y Janet !
Deuxième à droite. 200 m plus loin.
Merde ! Arrête la voiture !
Elle a pris à gauche.
- Seuls les piétons sont autorisés !
- Ahh !
Ianto, prends le volant !
Ca c'est ce
que j'appelle du service.
Santé.
Oui. Santé.
Merde.
- Il y a un problème ici, les gars ?
- Pas avec vous.
Allons-y alors,
finissons-en.
Pas besoin que tu t'en mêles, mon coeur.
Debout !
Merci.
Le Weevil a débarqué.
- On a un signal ?
- Ouais.
Tu peux me dire ce qui t'arrive ?
Nous ferions jamais
délibérément ça à un être humain.
Mais les Weevils sont
du gibier, c'est ça ?
Nous devons les suivre.
C'est votre crêche ?
Faites comme chez vous.
Je suis pas dans le bon business.
Quel est votre défouloir ?
Euh, pour quoi ?
La colère.
Qui a dit que j'étais en colère ?
Vous ne vivez même pas encore ici
que vous avez des gens après vous !
Ouais, et bien.
Certaines personnes
doivent prendre des leçons.
Je ne juge pas.
Vous n'êtes pas le seul
gus en colère là dehors.
C'est ce que la société nous fait
devenir. Vous voulez une bière ?
- Ouais, pourquoi pas.
- Vous travaillez stupidement.
Achetez une maison, une
voiture, un écran plasma...
Vous finissez avec de la main d'oeuvre.
Des gens qui s'occupent
de vous à chaque caprice.
Vous êtes officiellement prospère.
Et qu'est-ce que ça apporte ?
Rien. Le succès n'a
d'autre valeur que lui-même.
Sérieusement, je pourrais vivre
sans tout ça. Ca ne me définit pas.
Ouais, c'est bien de
l'avoir, pourtant, non ?
Demandez-vous.
Quel est le but de votre vie ?
Mark, mec...
Je suis juste venu pour une bière.
Il y a tellement plus.
Si vous savez où regarder.
C'est vrai ?
C'est plus près que vous ne le pensez.
Quelque chose approche.
Dehors,
dans les ténèbres,
quelque chose
approche.
Tu es ivre ?
Deux pintes. C'est tout
ce que j'ai pu descendre.
Ils ont continué sans moi.
- Ecoute, Gwen...
- Je dois te dire quelque chose.
Quelle sorte de chose ?
J'ai couché... j'ai fait
l'amour avec quelqu'un d'autre.
Du travail.
Il s'appelle Owen.
C'est un con et tout est fini mais...
- Tais-toi.
- Je suis désolée.
Je suis vraiment désolée.
- Tu n'aurais pas fait ça !
- Mais je l'ai fait.
- Alors pourquoi tu me le dis ?
- Car j'ai honte. Et je suis en colère.
Et je veux... j'ai besoin...
J'ai besoin que tu me pardonnes.
Et parce que je t'ai drogué.
- Tu as fait quoi ?!
- Assieds-toi.
Ce n'est rien, c'est juste une pillule
d'amnésie. Avec une goutte de sédatif.
Tu te réveilleras demain,
et tu auras tout oublié.
Rhys ?
- Mon Dieu, saloperie d'égoïste !
- Je sais.
Je pensais juste que ça
nous donnerait une chance,
une chance de remettre les
compteurs à zéro, tu vois ?
De tout faire sortir.
Rhys ! Reste avec moi, Rhys !
Dis que tu me pardonnes,
dis "Tout est ok, Gwen".
"Gwen, tout est ok."
Dis-le, s'il te plaît, Rhys. Rhys, dis-le
juste une fois, "Je te pardonne".
Rhys, s'il te plaît, dis-le !
Dis que tu me pardonnes !
Dis que tu me pardonnes, dis-le.
Dis-le, s'il te plaît, dis-le.
Dis-le, s'il te plait.
- Vous avez trouvé les toilettes ?
- Ouais, merci !
Je vous avais dit qu'il
y avait plus à voir.
Mark, mec, je suis vraiment désolé. Je
ne pouvais pas résister à un cadenas...
- Qu'est-ce que vous en pensez ?
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Aucune idée.
N'approchez pas trop, cependant.
Vicieux batard.
- Où l'avez-vous pris ?
- J'en ai trouvé un dans la rue.
On a du s'y mettre à 5 pour l'emmener.
A part ça, aucune idée.
Expérience scientifique
qui a mal tourné ?
Victime nucléaire ?
Un de nos gars suppose même
que c'est un extra-terrestre.
- Vous voulez savoir ce que je pense ?
- Ouais, continuez.
Je pense que c'est nous, Owen.
Vous et moi. Dans mille ans.
C'est ce que nous devenons, quand
tout ce qu'il nous reste est la colère.
L'idée n'est pas vraiment réconfortante.
Donnez-lui un coup.
- Quoi ?
- Tapez-le.
- Pourquoi ?
- Il sert à ça.
Ou vous voulez que je
le fasse pour vous ?
C'est juste un peu bizarre, c'est tout.
D'accord, c'est bon !
On peut pas dire qu'il
se défende beaucoup.
Nous avons tous besoin
d'un punching ball.
- Alors, qui es-tu, Owen ?
- Pardon ?
Il faudrait être stupide pour ne pas
voir que tu es lié aux deux du SUV noir.
- Je ne sais pas ce que vous voulez dire.
- Grand manteau, mignonne petite asiatique ?
J'ai vérifié.
Joli site Internet d'ailleurs, bravo à celui
qui l'a fait, bien que les anguilles gelées.
Ce ne soit pas votre meilleure idée.
- J'étais pas si mal !
- Plutôt, si.
Qui que vous soyez, vous avez
royalement foutu mes plans en l'air.
Je ne voulais pas que ça sorte d'ici.
Et pour Dan Hodges,
sa femme et son gamin ?
Je ne suis pas responsable
des choix de vie des gens.
Pourquoi avez-vous pris le corps ?
Pourquoi n'êtes-vous
pas allés voir les flic ?
Parce que, Mark, ce sont des merdeux dont
le cerveau imploserait s'ils voyaient ça.
Qui es-tu, Owen Harper ?
C'est ce que tu es ?
Un petit gamin se cachant
derrière une arme ?
Si tu veux savoir ce qui se passe, tu
ne le découvrira pas grâce à une arme.
Bon garçon, nous avançons enfin.
Maintenant, tu es juste toi.
Mets toi à nu, Owen.
Maintenant, nous sommes juste deux mecs.
- Egaux.
- Pourquoi avez-vous tué Dan Hodges ?
Je ne l'ai pas tué.
D'accord, pas réellement.
Vous avez fait ça ici ?
Je veux dire, vous avez laissé
cette chose se jeter sur lui.
Le meurtre parfait. Rien
ne vous reliant au crime.
Mon Dieu, tu n'as aucune
d'idée, n'est-ce pas ?
Dan n'a pas été assassiné.
Il était l'un d'entre nous.
Dites-moi ce qui s'est passé.
Je peux faire mieux que ça.
Allons-y !
Hé oh ?
Y'a quelqu'un ?
Alors où est-il, Tosh ?
- Alors qu'est ce qu'on a maintenant ?
- Rien.
On a aucune idée d'où ils
sont ou de ce qu'ils font.
Alors... Qu'est-ce que
je suis censé regarder ?
Attends et observe.
Tout ce monde est avec vous ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Tu le découvriras.
Je n'ai jamais été très surprises.
Jack, j'...
<i>Jack, tu m'entends ?</i>
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là, bon sang?
Je t'avais dit de rentrer chez toi.
Il y a un message qui vient d'arriver
sur le portable de Dan Hodges.
<i>Charlie Foxtrot One
Zero Six Bravo Yankee.</i>
Sûrement le code d'entrée d'un immeuble.
<i>Un qui doit avoir un panneau de
chez Lynch Frost dessus.</i>
- OK, j'ai la localisation.
- Gwen, on passe te prendre sur le chemin.
Des gens reçoivent un SMS et ils
se dirigent vers une propriété.
Une propriété que Lynch connaît.
Une propriété vide.
Donc la question est : Qu'est-ce
qui se passe quand ils sont là bas ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ici, bon sang ?
- L'échauffement.
- L'échauffement ?
- Qui sont ces gens ?
- Les mêmes que nous.
Des gens ordinaires qui essayent de trouver
une signification à un monde qui n'en a pas.
- Vous ne croyez quand même pas en ça ?
- Nous sommes dépouillés maintenant, Owen.
Toutes les certitudes que nos
parents avaient n'existent plus.
Nous sommes une
génération de non-croyance.
En société,
en religion,
ou dans la vie.
Tout ce que nous pouvons faire
est nous réduire au b-a-ba.
C'est seulement l'échauffement. Allez.
Tu viens ou tu restes ?
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 !
Faites-moi sortir !
Bien joué, mec. Ca coute
1500€ pour entrer dans la cage.
Celui qui reste le plus longtemps emporte
tout l'argent chez lui. Tu es le prochain !
Alors ces gens payent pour
mettre leur vie en danger ?
Le sport extrême ultime.
Trop d'argent disponible, pas
assez de signification. C'est nous.
Alors, qu'est ce qui s'est
passé avec Dan Hodges, Mark ?
Il ne voulait pas sortir.
Il est juste resté debout au milieu de
la cage et il l'a laissé le molester.
Je pense qu'il est rentré
là-dedans et qu'il a réalisé...
qu'il ne voulait pas vivre suffisament.
Il a abandonné. Aucun d'entre
nous n'a pu arriver à lui à temps.
Ouais. Et vous êtes tous revenus.
- Et bien, qu'y a-t-il d'autre ?
- Ca doit cesser.
Trop de gens vont mourir.
On va continuer à jouer
à ce jeu longtemps, Owen ?
Tu mens,
t'es qu'un tissu de conneries
et de belles paroles.
Mais tu te caches, Owen.
Va dans la cage.
Pas si tu pointes une arme sur moi.
Tu veux que je te tire dessus ?
Baisse ton arme.
Et après j'irai dans la cage.
Bon garçon.
- Qui a duré le plus longtemps là-dedans ?
- Ce doit être Dan Hodges.
Quand tu seras près de lui,
regarde-le dans les yeux.
Ouvrez la porte !
C'est comme regarder les plus
sombres replis de ta propre âme.
Ouvrez la porte !
Owen !
J'ai dit d'ouvrir la porte !
Jack !
Ouvrez-la !
- Owen ?
- M'approche pas.
Ca suffit !
Aide-moi, Jack,
aide-moi à le sortir de là !
- Owen, allez...
- Amenez une civière !
Vous lui avez fait ça.
Il s'est fait ça tout seul,
il n'avait pas peur.
C'est fini maintenant. Vous devez
laisser ces créatures tranquilles.
Retournez à vos vies.
Jack !
- Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
- C'est fini.
Tu n'aurais pas du.
Non, vraiment tu n'aurais
pas du. Je déteste le raisin.
Les docteurs considèrent
que tu peux rentrer chez toi.
Les docteurs. Qu'est-ce
qu'ils en savent, hein ?
Je ne voulais pas être sauvé.
Tu veux qu'on s'excuse ?
Pendant quelques
secondes dans cette cage,
je me suis senti totalement en paix.
Et ensuite vous avez tout fait foirer.
Tu crois toujours avoir raison, Jack ?
C'est ce que tu crois ?
Je te veux au travail demain.
- Tu es sûr que ça ira ?
- Laisse-nous seuls un moment, d'accord ?
Où est le SUV ? Il a été volé ?
Non. Nous oui.
Ils sont coincés au milieu
du Blitz de Cardiff !
Toshiko !
C'est notre devoir de
les faire sortir de là.
Ouvre la brèche maintenant
et le monde entier souffrira.
 Ou qui sait ce qu'il en sortira ?
Je t'aime.
C'est un piège pour inciter au
chaos total et à la destruction !
Tu ne sais même pas qui il est !
- C'est notre chef.
- Plus maintenant !

- Comment tu m'as fait ça ?
- L'Amour, on est toujours à sa merci.
Je déteste te décevoir,
mais tu n'es pas mon premier.
Spray Anti-Weevil.
Menottes.
Allez, rendons ça facile pour nous deux.
Ca arrive toujours quand
je leur laisse la nuit.
Ce n'est même pas à point, encore
moins bien cuit. Ces français...
Tu te souviens ce week-end à Paris,
l'endroit avec les panneaux de bois
ils avaient même pas encore mis le
steak sous le grill que tu as dit...
- Pourquoi tu me regardes comme ça ?
- Pardon, comme quoi ?
Comme si tu préférerais que
je sois quelqu'un d'autre.
Ca devient normal, hein ? Je débite,
je lève les yeux et tu es juste absente.
- Qu'est-ce qui nous arrive, Gwen ?
- Je sais. Je suis désolée.
C'est quelque chose que j'ai fait ?
Ou pas fait ?
Bon sang, qu'est-ce que c'était ?
- Oh mon Dieu, qu'est ce qui t'est arrivé ?
- Rhys, c'est ça ? Enchanté !
Désolé, c'est une urgence, je la
ramène pour le dessert. Viens...
- Attendez, c'est ma copine.
- Rhys, c'est Jack.
Assieds-toi, Gwen.
- C'est mon patron.
- Assieds-toi, putain !
Ne me parle plus jamais comme ça.
Allez, Gwen. Allons-y.
Hé, elle est avec moi ce soir.
Une nuit entière. Tu m'as promis.
Tu n'oseras pas.
Si tu pars maintenant, Gwen... !
Désolé de vous avoir interrompus,mais j'ai
quelques soucis avec celui-là.
Rhys survivra. Comme d'habitude.
Tu as promis que tu
continuerais à garder ta vie.
Ne la laisse pas te
glisser entre les doigts.
300 m sur la droite, au parking !
Jack ! Par ici !
Faites-le monter, faites-le monter !!
- Putain ils sont fous !
- Hé !
Mais qui sont-ils, bordel ?!

Primo : depuis quand d'autres
gens connaissent les Weevils ?
Deuxio : ont-ils déjà fait ça et
si oui, pourquoi on ne l'a pas su ?
Tertio : qu'est-ce qu'ils
veulent en faire de toute façon ?
Peut être aucun lien, mais
on a remarqué un déferlement
de blessures étranges
reportées par les secours.
Morceaux retirés des jambes et des bras,
blessures profondes au dos et à l'estomac.
Alors, on a une vague d'attaques
Weevil à ajouter à nos problèmes.
Et d'ailleurs, le spray qu'on
utilisait contre eux auparavant ?
Ils deviennent immunisés contre lui.
- Ils mutent ?
- Ou évoluent.
Alors, une piste sur celui
que nous avons perdu plus tôt ?
J'ai traqué la plaque d'immatriculation
du van. Elle est fausse.
2500 vans de ce type ont été
enregistré dans la zone de Cardiff.
Elargi ça à un rayon de
60 km et le nombre double.
- Lance une poursuite sur le véhicule.
- Cameras de circulation ?
<i>C'est la messagerie d'Owen,
laissez un message si nécessaire.</i>
Je lance la recherche.
<i>Laissez un message pour Gwen et
Rhys, et on vous rappellera...</i>
<i>- Si on s'en souvient...
- Hé !</i>
Salut, c'est moi. Ca fait 3
messages que je laisse maintenant.
Ecoute, j'ai une
douzaine d'excuses, hum...
<i>des centaines. Des milliers !</i>
<i>Mais aucune d'elle n'est assez bonne.</i>
Les choses m'ont un peu échappé récemment.
<i>C'est ce boulot. Ca ne
veut jamais s'arrêter.</i>
Ecoute, je te vois plus tard. Je ne sais
pas encore exactement à quelle heure.
J'ai du boulot à finir d'abord.
Appelle-moi.
<i>Message supprimé.</i>
Allez vous répondre à ça ?
9ème appel en absence : Travail.
Vous aimez votre boulot alors ?
Ecoutez, si ça ne vous dérange
pas... Je préfère être seul.
Ah, la vieille Greta Garbo.
Dans ce genre là.
Petit conseil : la prochaine fois
que vous vous sentez comme ça,
vous devriez rester.
Faites-moi confiance, plus la foule
est grande, plus je me sens seul.
J'ai dit : ne pas draguer les parieurs.
Tommy, je travaille dans un bar.
C'est mon boulot de leur parler.
Tu n'es jamais aussi contente que quand
tu montres tes nichons à un trou du cul.
Ne lui parlez pas comme ça.
- Quoi ?
- On avait une conversation.
Un jour, quand tu grandiras, tu réaliseras
que c'est ce que les êtres humain font.
Tommy, arrête. Tu vas me faire virer !
Tu vois, c'est l'art d'utiliser l'agression
de ton adversaire à tes propres fins.
Maintenant, je te conseillerai de ne pas
commencer de bagarres avec des étrangers.
Et vous devriez vraiment
mettre à jour votre petit-ami.
Qu'est ce qu'un homme doit faire pour
avoir un peu la paix dans cette ville ?
Owen ne répond toujours
pas à son téléphone.
Il est plus capricieux que d'habitude
depuis cette histoire avec Diane.
Depuis quoi ?
C'est pas mes affaires.
Quelle histoire ?
Quelle histoire, Tosh ?
Owen et Diane.
Avant qu'elle prenne l'avion,
ils ont eu un... truc.
- Tu le savais, non ?
- Oh, ouais, bien sûr que je le savais.
Je ne savais juste pas
qu'ils avaient eu un truc...
truc.
Ca a commencé il y a 10 minutes.
Qu'est-ce que tu crois qu'il fait ?
- Je pense qu'il pleure.
- Pourquoi ?
Owen étudie celui-là,
il pense qu'ils ont un faible
niveau de capacité télépathique,
pour partager leur émotions
à travers la distance.
Tu veux dire qu'il ressent peut-être
la douleur d'un autre Weevil ?
J'espère cependant qu'on a tort.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que ça voudrait dire que ces gens
ne capturent pas seulement les Weevils,
ils leur font du mal.
Qu'est-ce que tu ressens ?
Qu'est-ce que tu sais ?
J'ai suivi l'itinéraire du van. Il
est allé droit du parking aux docks.
C'était il y a 2 heures.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
- Les cameras de la CCTV se sont arrêtés.
- Tu crois que c'était voulu ?
Je pense que ces gars n'aiment
vraiment pas être observés.
Tu vois, je sais que c'est
la faiblesse du personnage...
qui me rend le plus déterminé
à découvrir ce qu'ils y cachent.
On dirait qu'on les a loupés.
Ouais, mais si tu quittes
les lieux subitement,
tu as tendance à être tête en l'air.
Tu sais pourquoi ils utilisaient ces
entrepôts pendant la 2eme Guerre Mondiale ?
Pour conserver les corps des soldats morts.
Parfois, tu peux trop connaître l'histoire.
Viens.
Il n'y a rien ici.
Alors qu'est-ce qu'ils faisaient là ?
Pourquoi faire tout ce chemin ?
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Ca a l'air humain.
Masculin.
- Il est vivant ?
- Hé ho ?
Vous allez bien ?
On cherche les gens qui
étaient ici la nuit dernière !
Si vous avez vu quelque chose,
c'est le bon moment pour parler.
Jack, il saigne.
- Oh, mon Dieu !
- Griffes de Weevils.
Tu ne crois pas qu'il est encore là ?
Non. On l'aurait entendu.
Aide-moi avec le corps.
C'est la sienne ?
Tu ne crois pas que j'aurais
choisi cette sonnerie ?
Ne réponds pas.
- Allô ?
- Je ne sais pas qui vous êtes.
<i>Mais restez en dehors de
ce qui ne vous regarde pas.</i>
- Qui a tué cet homme ?
- Avez-vous entendu ce que j'ai dit ?
J'ai cette surdité sélective quand
je parle aux lâches ou aux meurtriers.
<i>N'interférez pas dans des
choses que vous ne comprenez pas.</i>
Oh, je comprends ça mieux que vous.
Car je sais comment ça va finir.
On va vous chasser.
On va s'assurer que vous soyez
puni pour ce que vous avez fait ici.
Et on va vous faire rendre cette
créature que vous avez kidnappée.
C'est assez clair ?
Ianto ? J'ai besoin que tu traces tous les
appels de ce numéro dans les dernières 24h.
Aussi vite que possible. On rentre.
C'est la messagerie d'Owen.
Ne laissez pas de message.
<i>Bien essayé, Owen. Je veux que tu
rentres au Centre immédiatement.</i>
<i>On a un meurtre de Weevil, alors
ramène ton petit cul ici maintenant.</i>
Dan Hodges, date de
naissance, 21 Janvier 1979.
Vendeur pour une boîte de
logiciel d'éditions sur Internet.
On dirait qu'il était
marié, avec un enfant.
Ouais, sans aucun doute, Sherlock.
Bien, bel et bien tué par un Weevil,
mais il a reçu un bon coup de pied
avant que la gorge soit éclatée.
Les Weevils tuent généralement,
directement par la jugulaire.
Regardez sa tête : oeil au beurre noir,
des bleus sur les pommettes.
La même chose sur le dos et les côtes.
- Il aurait pu être torturé ?
- Peut-être.
Mais je pense que ces blessures
ont été infligées par des humains.
Mais pourquoi frapper les gens et
après jeter un Weevil sur eux ?
Pourquoi ne pas laisser le Weevil
faire tout le boulot pour toi ?
Alors, ce téléphone ?
Le dernier appel entrant était masqué.
L'historique des appels a été effacé.
Ils agissent rapidement.
Ces gars utilisent les Weevils
pour accomplir le meurtre parfait.
Pas d'empreintes, aucunes
traces d'ADN reconnaissables...
une mort rapide, et guarantie...
Rien pour lier qui
que ce soit au meurtre.
Bien. Ca va être du gateau
de trouver le tueur, alors.
Et pour ce gars ? Quelqu'un doit
dire à sa femme qu'il est mort.
La partie la plus chiante pour un
flic et je ne peux pas me dérober.
Merci pour tes quelques mots de soutien.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux que je te dise ?
Que ça ira bien en fin de compte ?
Tu peux toujours compter sur
Owen pour te sentir mieux.
Tosh a mentionné Diane et toi...
Avez-vous...
Je ne voulais pas qu'elle
parte. Elle est partie.
Pourquoi on continue à faire ça,
toi et moi ?
Bien. Arrêtons. Je commence à me lasser
de tes pirouettes sexuelles, de toute façon.
Tu peux être un sacré connard
parfois, Owen, tu sais ça ?
Oui, en fait.
T'étais passé où, bon sang ?
Je marchais.
Et bien, pendant ton absence,
Toshiko a eu une idée géniale.
Et bien, ça devait
arriver un jour ou l'autre.
Ignore-le, Tosh.
Ouais, ignore-moi, Tosh.
Je peux être un sacré
connard. Apparemment.
Le van avec le Weevil est
allé droit vers les entrepôts.
Ils devaient savoir qu'il était vide.
Soit ils leur appartiennent, soit ils ont
des relations avec les agents immobiliers.
Owen Harper, tu y vas
en tant que société.
Toshiko est en train
de régler ta couverture.
Attendez, pourquoi moi ?
Jack et Gwen étaient au
parking, j'étais aux entrepôts.
S'ils ont accès à la CCTV,
ils nous reconnaitront.
Nous devons passer sous leur garde,
pour découvrir ce qui se passe.
Ouais, d'accord.
Ca me dérange pas d'être
quelqu'un d'autre en ce moment.
- M. Harper ?
- Oui.
Mark Lynch.
Vous cherchez à relocaliser
votre société à Cardiff ?
Oui.
Et vous exportez de la
gelée d'anguille. Vraiment ?
Enorme marché grandissant.
Chine, Amérique du Sud, j'essaye tant bien
que mal d'aller aussi vite que la demande.
Je... vous en donnerai un lot si
vous me trouvez la bonne pêche.
Je pense que ça ira.
De la famille à déménager ?
Juste moi. C'est mieux comme ça.
Et vous cherchez des
locaux près des docks.
Hum, principalement de
grands entrepôts sympas.
J'ai quelques emplacements
qui devraient faire l'affaire.
- Attendez pendant l'impression.
- Merci.
On est dedans ! Ca va nous copier tout
son disque dur, même les fichiers protégés.
Si je peux établir un protocole
de route, quoi qu'il fera sur
son ordinateur à partir de
maintenant, on sera mis au courant.
Owen, c'est bon.
Voici les surfaces que vous cherchez,
bon accès, prix compétitifs...
Sauf...
qu'elles m'ont toutes l'air de poubelles.
Oui.
Un peu.
N'est-ce pas votre pancarte
sur la façade d'un grand entrepôt
dans la section Q des docks ?
Nous avons accepté une offre pour
celui-là. A peu près signé et clos.
<i>Il ment.</i>
D'après nos enregistrements, il a seulement
été mis sur le marché la semaine dernière.
Quelle poisse.
Pourquoi pas une celulle ou
une propriété industrielle ?
Vous sauvez une bonne partie du loyer,
même après le coût des transports.
Et vous vous avérez juste avoir une
liste de locaux appropriés ? Nan.
Il y a d'autres possibilités.
Vous êtes libre en fin de journée ?
Oui.
Voudriez-vous prendre un verre ?
Seul dans une ville étrange.
Je me souviens de ce sentiment.
Regardez-vous maintenant.
Quelques oiseaux splendides
répondant au téléphone pour vous.
Si ce n'est pas le succès,
je sais pas ce que c'est !
Que des foutaises, vraiment.
Mais si vous voulez que je
parle de vous autour de moi...
Non.
Merci.
Heureux de vous avoir rencontré, Mark.
Oui. Je vous passerai un coup de fil.
D'abord, il googlera
son nom sur Internet...
Ensuite il voudra savoir ce que
les gens disent de la société.
Maintenant il verra ce que
Owen dit à propos de lui-même.
<i>Bienvenue chez le fournisseur

Désolé, faux numéro.
Travail fini.
J'ai trouvé d'autres lots de
blessures suspectes à l'hôpital.
Elles ont l'air plutôt mauvaises.
Tosh, reste ici et surveille
les mouvements de Mark Lynch.
- Ianto avec moi...
- Je viens avec toi.
Rentre chez toi... Ce
n'est pas négociable.
Souviens-toi. Ne laisse
pas ça t'échapper.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Tu es là maintenant, hein ?
- C'est ton haut sexy.
- Non.
- Si !
C'est comme ça que tu l'appelles, depuis
que j'ai dit que tu étais sexy dedans.
- Tu sors ?
- Oui, Daf enterre sa vie de garçon.
- Toute une journée de travail.
- Depuis quand Daf va se marier ?
Il ne se marie pas. Mais il trouve
qu'il fait pas assez la fête.
Il est en période Rester Célibataire.
Quelques bières, on voit ce qui transpire.
Club de strip-tease, ce genre de choses.
A quelle heure tu rentres ?
Je suis pas sûr.
- Mais... je suis là ce soir.
- Et bien, pas moi.
J'ai déjà fait ma
déposition à la police.
Selon votre dossier médical,
vous avez presque eu votre coeur
arraché de votre cage thoracique.
10 heures d'opération pour réparer
les blessures de votre poitrine.
Pourquoi devrais-je vous parler ?
Laissez-moi vous dire
ce qui vous a fait ça.
1 m 80 de haut, dents
comme un requin, peau ondulée
et la fureur d'un animal sauvage.
J'en suis loin ?
J'ai été aggressé.
Ils étaient trois...
ils avaient des couteaux.
Alors pourquoi les secours ont décrits
vos blessures comme des morsures ?
Ecoutez, j'y peux rien
s'ils se sont trompés.
Ils sont surmenés.
Bon, j'ai plusieurs moyens
pour vous faire parler
mais le plus simple serait que vous pensiez
aux conséquences si jamais vous me mentez.
Et c'est que,
cette créature attaquera à nouveau.
Quelqu'un mourra.
Et ça sera sur votre conscience.
- Maintenant dites-nous la vérité.
- Je peux pas.
Ils me tueront.
- Qui vous tuera ?
- Tout le monde.
Qu'est ce qu'il veut
dire par "tout le monde" ?
C'est tout ce qu'il a dit. On
pouvait rien en tirer d'autre.
Ca nous laisse une seule option.
D'accord, Janet. C'est
l'heure de la promenade.
- Tu l'appelles Janet ?
- Barbara ne m'a jamais semblé bien.
Tu veux relâcher un Weevil
dans le centre de Cardiff ?!
Pas exactement au centre.
Un peu sur le côté.
On a placé un traqueur sur son bleu
de travail, quand ils le captureront,
on saura exactement où ils sont.
Il pourrait tuer
plusieurs personnes avant !
Je suis avec Tosh si tu me
dis pas ce que tu veux faire.
On le place au même endroit
où ils ont pris l'autre.
C'est désert à cette heure de la nuit.
On sera avec lui à
chaque pas qu'il fera.
- Le traqueur fonctionne ?
- Ouais.
Vas-y Janet !
Deuxième à droite. 200 m plus loin.
Merde ! Arrête la voiture !
Elle a pris à gauche.
- Seuls les piétons sont autorisés !
- Ahh !
Ianto, prends le volant !
Ca c'est ce
que j'appelle du service.
Santé.
Oui. Santé.
Merde.
- Il y a un problème ici, les gars ?
- Pas avec vous.
Allons-y alors,
finissons-en.
Pas besoin que tu t'en mêles, mon coeur.
Debout !
Merci.
Le Weevil a débarqué.
- On a un signal ?
- Ouais.
Tu peux me dire ce qui t'arrive ?
Nous ferions jamais
délibérément ça à un être humain.
Mais les Weevils sont
du gibier, c'est ça ?
Nous devons les suivre.
C'est votre crêche ?
Faites comme chez vous.
Je suis pas dans le bon business.
Quel est votre défouloir ?
Euh, pour quoi ?
La colère.
Qui a dit que j'étais en colère ?
Vous ne vivez même pas encore ici
que vous avez des gens après vous !
Ouais, et bien.
Certaines personnes
doivent prendre des leçons.
Je ne juge pas.
Vous n'êtes pas le seul
gus en colère là dehors.
C'est ce que la société nous fait
devenir. Vous voulez une bière ?
- Ouais, pourquoi pas.
- Vous travaillez stupidement.
Achetez une maison, une
voiture, un écran plasma...
Vous finissez avec de la main d'oeuvre.
Des gens qui s'occupent
de vous à chaque caprice.
Vous êtes officiellement prospère.
Et qu'est-ce que ça apporte ?
Rien. Le succès n'a
d'autre valeur que lui-même.
Sérieusement, je pourrais vivre
sans tout ça. Ca ne me définit pas.
Ouais, c'est bien de
l'avoir, pourtant, non ?
Demandez-vous.
Quel est le but de votre vie ?
Mark, mec...
Je suis juste venu pour une bière.
Il y a tellement plus.
Si vous savez où regarder.
C'est vrai ?
C'est plus près que vous ne le pensez.
Quelque chose approche.
Dehors,
dans les ténèbres,
quelque chose
approche.
Tu es ivre ?
Deux pintes. C'est tout
ce que j'ai pu descendre.
Ils ont continué sans moi.
- Ecoute, Gwen...
- Je dois te dire quelque chose.
Quelle sorte de chose ?
J'ai couché... j'ai fait
l'amour avec quelqu'un d'autre.
Du travail.
Il s'appelle Owen.
C'est un con et tout est fini mais...
- Tais-toi.
- Je suis désolée.
Je suis vraiment désolée.
- Tu n'aurais pas fait ça !
- Mais je l'ai fait.
- Alors pourquoi tu me le dis ?
- Car j'ai honte. Et je suis en colère.
Et je veux... j'ai besoin...
J'ai besoin que tu me pardonnes.
Et parce que je t'ai drogué.
- Tu as fait quoi ?!
- Assieds-toi.
Ce n'est rien, c'est juste une pillule
d'amnésie. Avec une goutte de sédatif.
Tu te réveilleras demain,
et tu auras tout oublié.
Rhys ?
- Mon Dieu, saloperie d'égoïste !
- Je sais.
Je pensais juste que ça
nous donnerait une chance,
une chance de remettre les
compteurs à zéro, tu vois ?
De tout faire sortir.
Rhys ! Reste avec moi, Rhys !
Dis que tu me pardonnes,
dis "Tout est ok, Gwen".
"Gwen, tout est ok."
Dis-le, s'il te plaît, Rhys. Rhys, dis-le
juste une fois, "Je te pardonne".
Rhys, s'il te plaît, dis-le !
Dis que tu me pardonnes !
Dis que tu me pardonnes, dis-le.
Dis-le, s'il te plaît, dis-le.
Dis-le, s'il te plait.
- Vous avez trouvé les toilettes ?
- Ouais, merci !
Je vous avais dit qu'il
y avait plus à voir.
Mark, mec, je suis vraiment désolé. Je
ne pouvais pas résister à un cadenas...
- Qu'est-ce que vous en pensez ?
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Aucune idée.
N'approchez pas trop, cependant.
Vicieux batard.
- Où l'avez-vous pris ?
- J'en ai trouvé un dans la rue.
On a du s'y mettre à 5 pour l'emmener.
A part ça, aucune idée.
Expérience scientifique
qui a mal tourné ?
Victime nucléaire ?
Un de nos gars suppose même
que c'est un extra-terrestre.
- Vous voulez savoir ce que je pense ?
- Ouais, continuez.
Je pense que c'est nous, Owen.
Vous et moi. Dans mille ans.
C'est ce que nous devenons, quand
tout ce qu'il nous reste est la colère.
L'idée n'est pas vraiment réconfortante.
Donnez-lui un coup.
- Quoi ?
- Tapez-le.
- Pourquoi ?
- Il sert à ça.
Ou vous voulez que je
le fasse pour vous ?
C'est juste un peu bizarre, c'est tout.
D'accord, c'est bon !
On peut pas dire qu'il
se défende beaucoup.
Nous avons tous besoin
d'un punching ball.
- Alors, qui es-tu, Owen ?
- Pardon ?
Il faudrait être stupide pour ne pas
voir que tu es lié aux deux du SUV noir.
- Je ne sais pas ce que vous voulez dire.
- Grand manteau, mignonne petite asiatique ?
J'ai vérifié.
Joli site Internet d'ailleurs, bravo à celui
qui l'a fait, bien que les anguilles gelées.
Ce ne soit pas votre meilleure idée.
- J'étais pas si mal !
- Plutôt, si.
Qui que vous soyez, vous avez
royalement foutu mes plans en l'air.
Je ne voulais pas que ça sorte d'ici.
Et pour Dan Hodges,
sa femme et son gamin ?
Je ne suis pas responsable
des choix de vie des gens.
Pourquoi avez-vous pris le corps ?
Pourquoi n'êtes-vous
pas allés voir les flic ?
Parce que, Mark, ce sont des merdeux dont
le cerveau imploserait s'ils voyaient ça.
Qui es-tu, Owen Harper ?
C'est ce que tu es ?
Un petit gamin se cachant
derrière une arme ?
Si tu veux savoir ce qui se passe, tu
ne le découvrira pas grâce à une arme.
Bon garçon, nous avançons enfin.
Maintenant, tu es juste toi.
Mets toi à nu, Owen.
Maintenant, nous sommes juste deux mecs.
- Egaux.
- Pourquoi avez-vous tué Dan Hodges ?
Je ne l'ai pas tué.
D'accord, pas réellement.
Vous avez fait ça ici ?
Je veux dire, vous avez laissé
cette chose se jeter sur lui.
Le meurtre parfait. Rien
ne vous reliant au crime.
Mon Dieu, tu n'as aucune
d'idée, n'est-ce pas ?
Dan n'a pas été assassiné.
Il était l'un d'entre nous.
Dites-moi ce qui s'est passé.
Je peux faire mieux que ça.
Allons-y !
Hé oh ?
Y'a quelqu'un ?
Alors où est-il, Tosh ?
- Alors qu'est ce qu'on a maintenant ?
- Rien.
On a aucune idée d'où ils
sont ou de ce qu'ils font.
Alors... Qu'est-ce que
je suis censé regarder ?
Attends et observe.
Tout ce monde est avec vous ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Tu le découvriras.
Je n'ai jamais été très surprises.
Jack, j'...
<i>Jack, tu m'entends ?</i>
Qu'est-ce que tu fais là, bon sang?
Je t'avais dit de rentrer chez toi.
Il y a un message qui vient d'arriver
sur le portable de Dan Hodges.
<i>Charlie Foxtrot One
Zero Six Bravo Yankee.</i>
Sûrement le code d'entrée d'un immeuble.
<i>Un qui doit avoir un panneau de
chez Lynch Frost dessus.</i>
- OK, j'ai la localisation.
- Gwen, on passe te prendre sur le chemin.
Des gens reçoivent un SMS et ils
se dirigent vers une propriété.
Une propriété que Lynch connaît.
Une propriété vide.
Donc la question est : Qu'est-ce
qui se passe quand ils sont là bas ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ici, bon sang ?
- L'échauffement.
- L'échauffement ?
- Qui sont ces gens ?
- Les mêmes que nous.
Des gens ordinaires qui essayent de trouver
une signification à un monde qui n'en a pas.
- Vous ne croyez quand même pas en ça ?
- Nous sommes dépouillés maintenant, Owen.
Toutes les certitudes que nos
parents avaient n'existent plus.
Nous sommes une
génération de non-croyance.
En société,
en religion,
ou dans la vie.
Tout ce que nous pouvons faire
est nous réduire au b-a-ba.
C'est seulement l'échauffement. Allez.
Tu viens ou tu restes ?
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 !
Faites-moi sortir !
Bien joué, mec. Ca coute
1500€ pour entrer dans la cage.
Celui qui reste le plus longtemps emporte
tout l'argent chez lui. Tu es le prochain !
Alors ces gens payent pour
mettre leur vie en danger ?
Le sport extrême ultime.
Trop d'argent disponible, pas
assez de signification. C'est nous.
Alors, qu'est ce qui s'est
passé avec Dan Hodges, Mark ?
Il ne voulait pas sortir.
Il est juste resté debout au milieu de
la cage et il l'a laissé le molester.
Je pense qu'il est rentré
là-dedans et qu'il a réalisé...
qu'il ne voulait pas vivre suffisament.
Il a abandonné. Aucun d'entre
nous n'a pu arriver à lui à temps.
Ouais. Et vous êtes tous revenus.
- Et bien, qu'y a-t-il d'autre ?
- Ca doit cesser.
Trop de gens vont mourir.
On va continuer à jouer
à ce jeu longtemps, Owen ?
Tu mens,
t'es qu'un tissu de conneries
et de belles paroles.
Mais tu te caches, Owen.
Va dans la cage.
Pas si tu pointes une arme sur moi.
Tu veux que je te tire dessus ?
Baisse ton arme.
Et après j'irai dans la cage.
Bon garçon.
- Qui a duré le plus longtemps là-dedans ?
- Ce doit être Dan Hodges.
Quand tu seras près de lui,
regarde-le dans les yeux.
Ouvrez la porte !
C'est comme regarder les plus
sombres replis de ta propre âme.
Ouvrez la porte !
Owen !
J'ai dit d'ouvrir la porte !
Jack !
Ouvrez-la !
- Owen ?
- M'approche pas.
Ca suffit !
Aide-moi, Jack,
aide-moi à le sortir de là !
- Owen, allez...
- Amenez une civière !
Vous lui avez fait ça.
Il s'est fait ça tout seul,
il n'avait pas peur.
C'est fini maintenant. Vous devez
laisser ces créatures tranquilles.
Retournez à vos vies.
Jack !
- Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
- C'est fini.
Tu n'aurais pas du.
Non, vraiment tu n'aurais
pas du. Je déteste le raisin.
Les docteurs considèrent
que tu peux rentrer chez toi.
Les docteurs. Qu'est-ce
qu'ils en savent, hein ?
Je ne voulais pas être sauvé.
Tu veux qu'on s'excuse ?
Pendant quelques
secondes dans cette cage,
je me suis senti totalement en paix.
Et ensuite vous avez tout fait foirer.
Tu crois toujours avoir raison, Jack ?
C'est ce que tu crois ?
Je te veux au travail demain.
- Tu es sûr que ça ira ?
- Laisse-nous seuls un moment, d'accord ?
Où est le SUV ? Il a été volé ?
Non. Nous oui.
Ils sont coincés au milieu
du Blitz de Cardiff !
Toshiko !
C'est notre devoir de
les faire sortir de là.
Ouvre la brèche maintenant
et le monde entier souffrira.
 Ou qui sait ce qu'il en sortira ?
Je t'aime.
C'est un piège pour inciter au
chaos total et à la destruction !
Tu ne sais même pas qui il est !
- C'est notre chef.
- Plus maintenant !

Diane Holmes, pilote.
Ne pars pas, s'il te plaît.
Allez !
Je ne svoulais pas être sauvé.
C'est les 88 ans de mon
grand-père aujourd'hui.
Je croyais que tu t'étais
fait belle pour moi.
88 est une année de
bonheur pour les Japonais.
Je dois aller à Londres regarder
des hommes lancer du riz.
Vous récupérez le riz coincé dans
la tuyauterie des restaurants Balti ?
Ok, au travail. Qu'est-ce qu'on a ?
La salle de bal du Ritz.
C'est abandonné depuis 1989 mais quelqu'un
s'est plaint d'y avoir entendu de la musique.
De la musique des années 40.
Chut !
Ecoute !
Tu viens ?
Ouah !
Regarde-moi ce lustre.
Pas de lumière néon à l'époque.
Juste de jeunes soldats fringants
et de jolies jeunes femmes.
Et alors qu'ils dansaient,
les filles regardaient leurs cavaliers dans
les yeux, souriaient doucement et disaient...
Jack ! Attention à mon ordinateur !
Je pensais plus à quelque chose du
genre: " Quand repars-tu à la guerre ? "
Viens. Il n'y a rien d'autre que
des souvenirs et de la poussière.
Ils ont l'air tellement vrais.
Ce ne sont pas des fantômes.
C'est une simple faille temporelle.
Et c'est magnifique !
On devrait partir.
- Revenez-nous vite.
- J'adorerais.
Il fait nuit !
Où est le SUV ?
Il a été volé ?
Non.
Nous l'avons été.

Qu'est-ce que c'est, bon sang ?
Le programme de surveillance
de la Brèche de Tosh.
Elle l'a mis en place pour
m'alerter de nouveaux mouvements.
La brèche s'étend de plus
en plus ces derniers temps.
Ouais, j'avais remarqué.
Pas besoin d'être un génie.
Tosh pense que les
équations forment un motif.
Je devrais l'appeler.
Elle a sûrement vu ça de son côté,
et ce n'est pas de mon ressort.
Pourquoi on m'a pas parlé de ça ?
T'étais pas là ces derniers jours, si ?
La ligne est morte.
Ça ne sert à rien. La ligne est morte.
Je ne peux pas contacter le Centre.
Retournons à l'intérieur.
C'est là où on était
lorsqu'on a traversé.
<i>Gwen, tu peux aller à Sage Street ?</i>
- Oui. Qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
- On a besoin de Tosh.
Le moniteur de la brèche a sonné.
Elle est avec Jack mais impossible de
les joindre, ni d'accéder à ses fichiers.
<i>Ok. J'y vais tout de suite.</i>
Nous sommes vraiment en 1941.
Et si on ne pouvait pas revenir ?
Des restes d'avions et de bateaux
traversent tout le temps. On rentrera.
Regarde le bon côté des choses.
Ça nous donne une sacré
excuse pour faire la fête.
J'ai une vie là-bas.
Et ils ne peuvent pas nous aider car
c'est moi qui ait les dernières données.
Les gens nous dévisagent.
On doit essayer de passer inaperçus.
Facile à dire pour toi.
- Je suis la seule asiatique ici.
- Ne t'inquiètes pas, t'es avec le Capitaine.
J'ai réussi à accéder aux dossiers
de Tosh, tous ses rapports.
Là, 24 Décembre.
C'est le jour où Diane
a traversé la brèche.
J'ai dû la laisser partir.
T'étais amoureux d'elle, hein ?
Si Tosh sait comment ouvrir la brèche,
on peut peut-être faire revenir Diane.
Jack ne l'autoriserait jamais. Ouvrir
la brèche pourrait dévaster la ville.
<i># My love is true</i>
<i># And just for you</i>
<i># I would do most
anything at any time... #</i>
De l'eau, s'il vous plaît, et un cognac.
Je ne vous ai jamais vus ici.
3,6 livres, s'il vous plaît, monsieur.
Je...
vais payer.
Merci.
- A une condition.
- Quoi ?
<i># Come to me, my melancholy baby... #</i>
Pourquoi George dance avec une Jap ?
Le SUV est là.
Ils doivent être dans le coin.
Jack ?
Tosh !
Jack !
<i> " Come to me, my melancholy... #</i>
Vous permettez ?
- Je ne fais que l'emprunter, mon gars.
- Peut-être ne veut-elle pas ?
Vous voulez en faire une histoire ?
Vous pouvez toujours danser
avec moi, si vous voulez.
Ok, je vais mener. Tu suis.
Viens, Tosh.
Jack !
- Jack, on est sensés passer inaperçus.
- Arrête ça, petit.
Désolé.
Les hommes sont assez vifs ce soir.
Dernier jour d'entraînement demain.
- Excuse-toi auprès du gentleman, George.
- Je ne faisais que danser.
Je pense que c'est ton poing qu'il
n'a pas apprécié, pas ton pas de danse.
- Désolé.
- C'est bon. Tu m'as à peine touché.
Je pense que la dame
mérite aussi des excuses.
Je suis désolé.
Excuses acceptées.
Prenons un verre, George.
- Vous êtes aussi un volontaire ?
- Oui.
Je suis le Capitaine...
Allez-y.
Je suis le Capitaine Jack
Harkness. 133ème Esquadre.
Regardez par ici, s'il vous plaît.
Bon, la salle de bal du Ritz,
ouverte en 1932, fermée en 1989.
Doit être démolie dans une semaine.
La musique entendue date des années 40.
Pourquoi une histoire de fantôme
leur prend autant de temps ?
Tous ces jeunes soldats...
Owen, regarde.
Là.
Une de plus en souvenir.
J'insiste.
Merci, messieurs.
- Je devrais rentrer...
- Je n'ai pas entendu vos noms.
Toshiko Sato.
Je suis le Capitaine
James Harper. 71ème.
La 71ème, c'est là que j'espère être
assigné. Comment avez-vous fait ?
Peut-être plus tard. Mon
amie et moi étions occupés.
Bien sûr.
Pourquoi cet homme porte ton nom ?
Je suis assez perdue ici sans
que tu me tournes le dos !
Ce n'est pas mon nom.
C'est le sien.
J'ai pris le sien.
Mais je n'avais pas réalisé
qu'il était... si canon !
Jack !
J'en sais trop.
Alors... partage !
Tu ne veux pas savoir. Crois-moi.
On doit rentrer.
Qu'est-ce que tu as là ?
La moitié d'une équation.
L'autre moitié est au Centre.
Si je trouve un moyen de
ramener ces chiffres à la base,
ils pourront les combiner,
ouvrir la brèche et nous ramener.
Viens, d'accord ?
J'ai entendu de la
musique tout à l'heure.
Si je peux les entendre,
peut-être peuvent-ils m'entendre.
Il faut qu'ils reviennent.
Jack !
Tosh !
Quoi ?
J'ai cru entendre mon nom.
Ok, on se sert des infos de
Tosh pour ouvrir la brèche,
et les ramener.
On ne peut pas.
Il manque la moitié de l'équation.
C'est pas possible. Elle doit bien
être quelque part. Laisse moi voir.
Elle n'est pas là.
C'est sûrement sur son portable.
Dont elle ne se sépare jamais.
Merde. Merde !
Personne. Viens, vite.
Ça marche !
<i> " Votre batterie est faible. "</i>
Prends tout, au cas où il s'éteigne.
- J'ai pas l'habitude d'écrire avec ça !
- N'appuie pas si fort.
Oh, non.
<i>" Votre batterie est faible. "</i>
Tu peux me lire ça ?
Plus un sur cinq...
sinus 2 A X.
Tu as tout ce qu'il faut ?
Il me faut juste les
coordonnées de la salle de bal,
pour pouvoir les
intégrer dans l'équation.
Puis ils faut faire parvenir
les informations au Centre.
Que faites-vous ici ?
Qui êtes-vous ?
Capitaine... James Harper.
Et voici Toshiko Sato,
amie et mathématicienne.
Je suis Bilis, le gérant.
- Votre uniforme est incomplet, Capitaine.
- En permission.
48 heures.
C'est un appareil photo intéressant.
Il prend des photographies instantanées.
Je ne savais pas qu'ils
pouvaient déjà faire ça.
Et je ne savais pas qu'ils faisaient
des attachés-cases en métal.
Où l'avez-vous eu ?
Londres. Je suis de là-bas.
Je dois y retourner, mes
chers. Ils viennent pour nous.
J'ai bien regardé à l'intérieur,
mais les portes étaient fermées.
Puis-je vous aider ?
Je suis le concierge.
Bilis Manger, à votre service.
Bonjour. Pourriez-vous
tout ouvrir pour moi ?
Je pense que des amis
se sont fait enfermer.
Suivez-moi.
Merci.
- Pearl Harbour, Jack.
- Ça n'arrive pas avant la fin de l'année.
Grand-père est resté à Londres
mais il était persécuté.
Si je reste ici,
que m'arrivera-t-il ?
Je prendrai soin de toi.
Cette période, tu
sembles y être à l'aise.
Tu y as déjà vécu ?
Oui.
Je ne peux pas t'expliquer, mais
j'ai servi en 1941, pendant la guerre.
J'étais sous couverture.
Il me fallait une fausse identité,
alors j'ai pris... son nom.
Qui étais-tu avant de prendre son nom ?
- Pourquoi lui ?
- C'était pratique.
Mais si tu as choisi de voler
son identité, alors il...
est mort, au combat.
Quand ?
Demain.
Et je lui dit :
" Ecoute, chéri, il pleut des bombes
et du feu, alors descends à la cave. "
Et elle me dit " Je ne peux
pas, il y a des rats là-bas " !
- Qui est le meilleur navigateur ici ?
- C'est Tim.
Il déteste voler, mais au moins, une fois
dans l'eau, il sait exactement où il est.
Venez discuter par ici.
Je donne 15 jours à cet écolier.
Ce garçon a fait du
chemin en 5 semaines.
Tant que vous vous rappelez bien
votre entraînement, tout ira bien.
Content que vous soyez là. On s'assoit ?
Pourquoi vos amis
étaient-ils ici, d'ailleurs ?
Juste un stupide défi.
On dit que cet endroit est hanté.
Vous avez l'air inquiète, ma chère.
Je vais vous faire
une bonne tasse de thé.
Le soleil s'est levé aujourd'hui à 8h02,
21 par 7 degrés.
Je le note chaque jour.
C'est un peu idiot, je suppose.
C'est fantastique.
Vous avez dû voir pas mal d'action.
Disons juste que l'ennemi
a bien des apparences.
Oui. J'ai hâte de montrer
ce que je sais faire.
Combien en avez-vous tué dans la Bataille
de Bretagne, Capitaine ? 26, c'est ça ?
Tu as raconté cette histoire
des milliers de fois, George.
Personne n'est aussi rapide que
lui. Il n'a encore perdu aucun homme.
- Vous buvez quelque chose, Capitaine ?
- Je prendrai juste de l'eau, merci.
Très bien.
Bonsoir, Jack. Je sais que tu
passes la nuit avec tes hommes,
mais j'ai pensé que je pourrais
passer, si ça ne te dérange pas.
Oui.
Content de te voir.
Quelqu'un vous attend t'il ?
Oui.
Vous devriez peut-être les appeler,
ou ils pourraient bien penser
que vous avez aussi disparu.
Je vais faire chauffer l'eau.
Rien de votre côté ?
Il n'y a pas d'autres photos de
Jack et Tosh après cette nuit-là.
- C'est encourageant.
- Oui, à moins que les bombes les aient eu.
Le gérant, Bilis Manger,
les a gardées pour la postérité.
Bilis Manger ?
C'est le nom du concierge.
- Ça ne peut pas être le même, si ?
- Il n'est pas assez vieux.
Bien qu'il semble un peu hors de
son temps. Il porte un foulard.
Gwen, il est sur la
photo avec Jack et Tosh.
Il est la clé. Il est passé à travers
la brèche. Trouve ce qu'il fait.
Non, vas t'en Gwen. Attends du renfort.
- On ne peut pas le perdre.
- Gwen non plus ! C'est peut-être un piège.
Il pourrait nous enlever
à notre époque un par un.
- Sors de là, Gwen.
- Désolé, mais qui t'as mis aux commandes ?
J'ai ce qu'il me faut.
Tout ce que j'ai à faire,
c'est trouver un moyen de
laisser un message à l'équipe
sur quelque chose qui
durera dans le temps.
Je ne vous ai jamais
vus ici, tous les deux.
- Elle est avec vous ?
- Nan, elle est après Tim.
Pourquoi le laisserait-elle l'ennuyer
à mort avec la navigation sinon ?
- C'est peut-être un espion.
- Les chinois sont dans notre camp, non ?
Je suis japonaise.
- Vous êtes presque une alliée, alors.
- Laisse-là, Audrey.
Alors de quel côté êtes-vous ?
Qu'y-a-t-il dans le sac ?
Rien.
- Si vous n'avez rien à cacher, ouvrez-le !
- Elle ne peut pas.
Son travail est top-secret. Elle
est décodeur pour les britanniques.
Sans des femmes comme elle, nous ne
pourrions pas défendre le pays.
- A Toshiko !
- Toshiko !
Il me faut l'appareil de Bilis.
Les photographies durent, non ?
Tu ne veux pas que je vienne ?
Oh, vous ne pouvez pas m'échapper.
Je viens juste de vous payer un verre.
Ça va. Continuez.
A un camarade Capitaine !
- Alors, qu'est-ce qui vous amène ici ?
- Je devais me reposer.
- J'ai été touché au dos en secondant Kent.
- C'est son excuse pour ne pas danser.
Je peux me joindre à vous ?
Bien sûr. Pourquoi pas ?
Ça devient une habitude.
Je voulais juste l'essayer.
Cette petite beauté est très
inhabituelle et rare, tout comme vous.
Ne partez pas sans cela.
Il y a de meilleures choses à
photographier que des nombres, ma chère.
Revenez-nous vite.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Owen !
On n'a pas les nombres manquants. On va
improviser avec le Manipulateur de Brèche.
On ne peut pas. C'est déjà
assez risqué avec l'équation.
Si on ne le fait pas correctement,
n'importe quoi peut arriver.
Des bombes tombent.
Ils sont coincés en plein
milieu du Blitz de Cardiff.
C'est notre devoir de les aider.
Jack ?
Ouvre la brèche et le monde entier risque
de souffrir. On pourrait tous être aspirés.
Qui sait ce qui en sortira ?
C'est pour Diane ! Quand accepteras-tu
qu'elle ait choisi de te quitter ?
Alors que ta cyber-copine est restée.
Enfin elle avait pas vraiment
le choix, attachée dans la cave.
- C'était différent.
- Oui.
Surtout parce que Diane n'a pas essayé
de nous tuer et qu'elle était humaine.
- Et non un monstre foiré.
- Je pensais que c'était toujours Lisa.
Je l'aimais.
- Tu connaissais Diane depuis une semaine.
- Et ce n'était pas assez !
Peut-être que le Manipulateur peut
calculer les chiffres manquants.
- Ça ne marche pas.
- Bien.
Jack n'aurait jamais voulu
qu'on l'utilise de cette façon.
Il manque une pièce.
Il faut qu'on la trouve.
- Tu devrais peut-être rentrer chez toi.
- Tu n'as aucun pouvoir sur moi.
Ok, Ianto, on va le faire
à ta façon. Sûr et chiant.
Alors, quelle est vote
prochaine mission ?
Des bavardages négligents
coûtent des vies.
- Je devrais y aller, de toute façon.
- Non, je ne voulais pas dire...
C'est bon. Quelqu'un pourra me
ramener si je pars maintenant.
Je ferais mieux de rester ici.
Tu ne pars pas demain soir ?
Tu en as déjà marre des Gallois ?
Oui, c'est pour ça que je
continue à me battre pour toi.
Je te contacterai à ma
prochaine permission.
Nancy...
j'ai aimé ces quelques semaines.
C'est tout ?
C'est une gentille fille, mais je
dois veiller sur mes hommes ce soir.
C'est leur dernier jour demain.
Rejoignez-la.
Embrassez-la.
Vous ne savez pas ce qui
peut se passer demain.
C'est juste un entraînement routinier.
Je ne vais sûrement pas mourir.
C'est là qu'ils vous attrapent,
quand vous vous y attendez le moins.
Vous ne savez pas ce qui va se passer.
Allez l'embrasser en guise d'au-revoir.
Nancy ?
Je t'aime.
Ça n'a fait qu'empirer les choses.
Maintenant elle croit
être amoureuse de moi.
Hé, ce n'est pas ma faute
si elle craque pour vous.
Faites le dur devant vos hommes, mais pas
devant moi. Vous avez le droit d'avoir peur.
Un capitaine doit garder la tête haute.
Un capitaine doit expliquer les risques,
dire à ses hommes à quoi s'attendre.
Qu'est-ce que je dois faire ?
Leur dire que j'ai vu un jeune garçon se
faire tirer dans les yeux en milieu de vol ?
Je comprends.
Vraiment ? L'avez-vous entendu crier
dans la radio, demandant sa mère,
pendant que les Messerschmitts le tuaient
en réduisant son avion en morceau ?
- Tout ce que j'entendais dans la radio...
- C'était des cris.
Je suis allé à la guerre quand j'étais
jeune. J'étais avec mon meilleur ami.
On s'est fait prendre à traverser
la frontière en lignes ennemies.
Ils l'ont torturé lui, pas
moi, car il était plus faible.
Ils m'ont forcé à le regarder mourir.
Et ils m'ont laissé partir.
Qui étaient-ils ?
Les pires créatures possibles
que vous puissiez imaginer.
Je l'avais persuadé de s'engager.
Lui disant que ce serait une aventure.
Il n'avait pas vécu.
Avons-nous vécu ?
Ok, les mecs... J'espère que
vous aimez les chasses au trésor.
Aucun signe de Bilis quittant le coin.
- Où tu vas ?
- A la salle de bal.
Au bureau de Bilis.
Il doit savoir comment la brèche fonctionne.
Peut-être trouvera t'on un indice là-bas.
Qu'est-ce que feraient Jack et Tosh ?
Comment essayeraient-ils de nous aider ?
Bilis !
Il me faut plus d'équations, Gwen.
Que s'est-il passé ici, Tosh ?
Non.
Toshiko !
- Toshiko !
- Jack !
Par ici !
Je n'ai pas eu la première partie
sur la photo. Le reste est hors-cadre.
S'ils le trouvent, ils
continueront à chercher, non ?
Oui.
<i>Fais attention, Gwen. Bilis
est toujours dans le coin.</i>
Owen, où es-tu ?
<i>Je suis dans l'immeuble.
Où est le bureau de Bilis ?</i>
Tout au fond du couloir.
Je continue à chercher ici.
Oui !
Tu pourrais être la dernière
fille que j'embrasse.
Je dois finir le message.
Du stylo s'effacerait. Je
dois trouver autre chose.
Très bien. Ça ira.
<i># There'll be bluebirds over</i>
<i># The white cliffs of Dover</i>
<i># Tomorrow</i>
<i># Just you wait and see... #</i>
Ok.
Merde !
Des morceaux de temps.
Je n'ai pas trouvé d'équations.
Je vais rentrer au Centre.
- Je continue à chercher ici, alors.
- Ouais, fais-donc ça.
Oui.
Bien sûr que j'ai peur.
Je vais chercher les autres chiffres
partout. Je n'abandonne pas Jack maintenant.
<i># There'll be bluebirds over... #</i>
Que la danse continue !
J'ai fini. Le reste de
l'équation est caché.
Que s'est-il passé ?
J'ai glissé.
J'ai une trousse de secours dans le camion.
Un scotch, Capitaine ?
J'aimerais passer un moment
seul avec le Capitaine Harper.
Ianto ? Oui, c'est moi. Je l'ai trouvé.
C'est écrit avec du sang.
Gwen a trouvé le reste de l'équation.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle a pour nous ?
Somme de: sin² X axcx = x/2.
Non, il me faut au moins 3 chiffres de
plus. Gwen. Ils doivent être autre part.
<i>Non, ils n'y sont pas.</i>
Comment le sais-tu ?
Quelqu'un a effacé
les derniers chiffres.
Tosh a écrit un message à la fin.
Ça dit "Dites à ma
famille que je les aime. "
Pourquoi m'avez-vous fait l'embrasser ?
Je pense juste que vous devez vivre
chaque nuit comme si c'était la dernière.
Faites de cette nuit la
meilleure de votre vie.
Vous êtes en vie : ici, maintenant.
Vos hommes vont bien.
Qu'essayez-vous de me dire ?
Allez la voir.
Allez voir votre femme
et perdez-vous en elle.
Peut-être que je le devrais.
Oui.
- Toshiko est votre femme ?
- Non.
Il n'y a personne.
Allez la voir.
Ça ne marche toujours
pas. Il manque une pièce.
Bilis l'avait depuis le début.
L'équation n'est toujours pas complète.
Peut-être que la machine peut trouver.
Owen !
Il doit y avoir quelque chose
dans le coffre. Des instructions.
Tu ne peux pas l'ouvrir,
tu n'en as aucun droit.
Je suis le numéro deux, j'ai
tous les putain de droits.
Il y a des choses qu'on ne sait pas.
Et Jack veut que ça reste comme ça.
Je toucherai pas à ses jouets, Ianto !
" Rhea Silva, dieu de
la guerre bourgeoise. "
Et un numéro à neuf
chiffres. Pas si malin, Jack.
Les plans du Manipulateur de Brèche.
Je croyais que vous étiez parti.
Ça pourrait être votre dernière chance.
C'est pour ça que je suis revenu.
Je devrais peut-être partir
avant la fin de la nuit.
Et bien, donnons-nous
au maximum maintenant.
On a besoin du coin des amoureux,
si ça vous dérange pas, les garçons.
Bien sûr. Je discutais juste
stratégie avec le Capitaine.
On va aller autre part.
Non.
Vous m'avez dit tout
ce que j'avais à savoir.
Il y a des instructions là-dedans.
Ce n'est pas un coup de folie.
C'est un piège ! Bilis
voulait que tu le trouves !
Pourquoi ?
Pour ouvrir la brèche. Pour inciter
au chaos et à la destruction.
Toutes les plaintes concernant la
salle de balle étaient anonymes.
Et si c'était lui ?
- S'il te plaît, écoute-moi !
- J'en ai marre d'avoir peur de la brèche.
J'en ai marre de vivre avec les secrets
de Jack. On ne sait même pas qui il est !
- C'est notre chef.
- Plus maintenant.
Dégage de mon chemin.
Ianto !
Demain, c'est leur dernier entraînement,
un jour comme un autre.
Ils vont en opération
et sont surpris par deux
formations de Messerschmitts.
Il élimine 3 des ennemis.
Ses hommes écoutent ses cris
de joie à travers la radio.
Et puis tout devient calme.
Il ne peut pas s'en sortir
car tout son avion est en feu.
Mais ses hommes s'en sortent tous.
Pose cette clé !
Ou je tire.
Qui étais-tu ?
Un escroc.
C'est pour ça que j'ai pris son nom,
falsifié les rapports pour qu'il
ait l'air d'être encore en vie.
Comment as-tu fini à Torchwood ?
Quelqu'un m'a sauvé la vie.
M'a ramené de la mort.
Et depuis, on dirait qu'ils me gardent pour
une raison, mais je ne sais pas laquelle.
Je suis désolé de t'avoir
entraînée là-dedans.
C'était mon choix.
Je veillerai sur toi.
Mais je ne peux rien faire pour lui.
Tu dois laisser partir Diane.
Comme je l'ai fait avec Lisa.
Ne te compare pas à moi.
- Tu ne sert qu'à faire le thé.
- Je suis bien plus que ça.
Jack a besoin de moi.
Dans tes rêves, Ianto.
Dans tes tristes rêves mouillés où tu
es son plan-sexe à mi-temps, peut-être.
Cette brèche m'a pris ma
maîtresse et mon Capitaine.
Si je meurs en essayant de la
vaincre, ce sera une mort honorable.
Aaaah !
Tu ne sais pas ce que tu as fait.
<i># That certain night</i>
<i># The night we met</i>
<i># There was magic abroad in the air</i>
<i># There were angels dancing at the Ritz</i>
<i># And a nightingale sang
in Berkeley Square...</i>
<i># .. I may be right</i>
<i># I may be wrong... #</i>
Que fait-il ?
<i># .. But l'm perfectly
willing to swear... #</i>
Jack !
Jack, il faut qu'on s'en aille !
Jack, tu dois venir !
On a besoin de toi !
Je dois y aller.
C'est mon devoir.
Oh, vous avez réussi ! Vous êtes là !
Vous êtes là !
- Oh, Tosh, viens-là, viens-là, viens-là !
- Je vais bien.
Je savais qu'on faisait
ce qu'il fallait,
en ouvrant la brèche.
Toujours aucun signe de Bilis.
Ce n'était pas la fin
du monde, finalement.
- Heureusement que tu sais pas tirer.
- Je visais ton épaule.
C'était en temps de guerre, je
sais, mais c'était magnifique.
Des anges dansaient au Ritz.
- Jack...
- Laisse-moi faire.
Il aurait été si fier
que tu prennes son nom.
Car te voilà, sauvant le monde.
Au Capitaine Jack.
Au Capitaine Jack.
La première chose que tu as apprise à
Torchwood était de ne pas ouvrir la brèche.
- Trop dangeureux. Trop imprévisible.
- Merde.
Des gens tombent à travers le temps et
amènent avec eux chaque maladie
de l'histoire à vos portes.
Tu n'es pas encore assez effrayé ?
Tu ne peux pas contrôler le
temps. Tu ne peux pas les ramener.
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Toutes les fissures, à travers
le monde, ce sont des diversions.
C'est ce que veut Bilis.
Ouvre la brèche.
Pour l'Amour de Dieu. On
doit se serrer les coudes.
J'ouvre la brèche.

Ouvre la brèche et le monde
entier risque de souffrir.
Tu sais, c'est malpoli
de fixer quelqu'un.
Je pensais que t'hypnotiser
permettrait d'avoir une tasse de café.
- Et qu'est-ce que j'y gagne ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Je te fais un dessin ?
Beau cul !
<i>Ne réponds pas !</i>
Oui.
<i>Tu regardes les infos ?</i>
<i>Il y a des suppositions sur les incidents
de la nuit dernière qui pourraient être liés.</i>
<i>Les premiers rapports évoquent
l'engagement de terroristes.</i>
<i>Mais certains experts des renseignements ont
affirmé que les incidents seraient furtifs.</i>
<i>Les premières observations sont des
OVNIs, au-dessus du Taj Mahal en Inde.</i>
<i>Ils sont arrivés juste après minuit.</i>
<i>A Londres, ce matin, des hommes
en habits historiques</i>
<i>ont attaqué les forces de police.</i>
<i>Certains groupes religieux affirment
que les événements de la nuit dernière</i>
<i>sont une justification
de leurs enseignements.</i>
Tu penses que ce sont des terroristes ?
Les terroristes mettent des
bombes. Ca, c'est différent.
<i>Les gens ne nous croyaient
pas. Maintenant ils devront.</i>
<i>Le jour du Jugement Dernier
est finalement arrivé.</i>
<i>C'est la Fin des Temps.</i>

" J'ai entendu mais je  n'ai pas compris,
" et j'ai dit : Maître, quelle est la Fin
de toutes ces choses ?
" Et il a répondu :
Vas-y Daniel,
" pour que ces choses soient enfermées
et condamnées jusqu'à la fin des temps. "
Daniel 12, verset 10.
Ca a l'air rassurant.
Cette machine déconne.
Elle continue de perdre de l'énergie.
Pardon, ne me laissez pas
interrompre vos présages ténébreux.
- Ou avez-vous terminé ?
- Non. Il y en a plus d'où elles viennent.
Abaddon, le Grand Dévoreur, qui
guidera le monde vers les ténèbres.
Merci, Ianto, pas de superstitions.
Vous aimez toutes les histoires qui nient
le caractère aléatoire de l'existence.
- Merci. Ca me fait me sentir mieux.
- Ok, j'ai reçu différents appels.
Le gouvernement, les commandos, la CIA...
La moitié du monde occidental et du
moyen-orient se pose la même question.
Est-ce que ça a voir avec nous ?
Et ça l'est ?
J'ai lancé un profil sur chaque
anomalie temporelle rapportée
et j'ai suivi chaque motif
physique ou temporel.
Merde !
Les fissures se relient
toutes ici sur la brèche.
Cette ville, ce QG, est le centre.
Ce que vous voyez partout dans le monde
sont des ondulations et des répliques.
La brèche se fragmente à cause de toi.
Quoi ?
Tu l'as ouverte sans savoir ce que tu faisais.
Tu as élargi les fissures temporelles.
Le temps jaillit à travers.
Si je ne l'avais pas fait, vous deux
seriez encore dans les années 40.
Alors on va continuer de pleurer dans notre
coin, ou on essaye de faire quelque chose ?
Amener ceux qui sont tombés à travers
le temps ici, dans le coffre-fort.
Et on fera quoi d'eux ?
On s'occupe d'abord de l'étape 1,
et je te dirai la seconde ensuite.
Tu ne peux pas contrôler le temps, ni les
renvoyer. Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
On va y réfléchir !
Hé...
ce n'est pas la Fin du Monde.
J'en suis sûr.
Priorité 1 d'assistance à l'hôpital. Les
taux de mortalité atteignent le plafond.
Ils indiquent une zone chaude.
- J'y vais.
- Tosh, vas avec lui.
 Non, merci, je suis mieux tout seul.
Et tu seras même mieux avec
moi à tes côtés. Tais-toi.
T'étais obligé de le harceler
comme ça en public ?
Chaque action a sa conséquence.
Et tous tes équipiers ont des
sentiments, Jack, même Owen.
Tu le sais mieux que moi.
Il t'a ramené.
Tu aurais préféré être resté bloqué
pendant la 2e Guerre Mondiale ?
Allo ?
<i>Gwen, c'est Andy.</i>
Ecoute, je ne savais
pas qui d'autre appeler.
Double meurtre.
Il a poignardé deux gars à Penarth.
C'était brutal. Pas de pitié.
Qu'est-ce qu'on est supposé faire ?
Il ne parle même pas un mot d'anglais,
et il est habillé en soldat Romain !
Il n'est pas habillé en soldat Romain,
c'EST un soldat Romain et il crie en latin.
Le seul mot que j'ai compris est Gelligaer.
Gelligaer.
Il y a un fort Romain à Gelligaer.
Construit en 75 av-JC environ.
Il était en chemin quand le temps
s'est fendu, et il a atterri ici.
Pardon ?
Salut. Vous parlez avec
bon sens quelques fois... ?
Ce soldat est arrivé par
une fente dans le temps.
Il n'est pas sérieux, si ?
Ce genre de choses
n'arrivent pas. Pas à Cardiff.
Ce n'est pas parce que vous ne comprenez
pas, qu'elles ne sont pas réelles.
Je sais que ça parait fou, Andy...
D'accord, Mulder et Scully.
On dit que je vous crois,
même si c'est pas vrai,
car c'est des conneries.
Comment fait-on exactement pour s'occuper
d'un prisonnier d'il y a 2000 ans ?
Est-ce qu'il a les mêmes droits que tout le
monde ? Comment ça va marcher avec les CPS ?
Nous allons nous en occuper.
Malgré les circonstances,
un soldat Romain exubérant est
l'idée que je me fais d'un matin parfait.
Attention, Jack.
Tout le monde le dit, tu sais.
Au travail, dans la rue.
Tu penses que c'est la Fin du Monde ?
Oh, Andy, ne sois pas idiot.
Tu penses que le monde va
se finir pendant ta garde ?
Je t'ai vu utiliser ce sourire
avec beaucoup de monde.
Quel sourire ?
Le sourire que tu utilises pour
rassurer les gens quand tout va mal.
C'est la première qui est morte.
Pas d'identité. Elle est juste
apparue au milieu des urgences.
Personne ne l'a vue arriver, elle
n'est pas enregistrée au bureau.
- Alors qu'est-ce qu'il s'est passé ?
- Elle a commencé à tousser du sang.
On l'a mise immédiatement en isolement.
Une heure plus tard, le personnel
ressentait les mêmes symptômes.
Qui étaient ?
Des bosses, rhume, fièvre, maux de têtes,
avec des taches noires sur la peau.
Montrant des saignements sur la peau
et sûrement dans d'autres organes.
Du personnel, ça s'est répandu aux
patients qui étaient en consultation.
Ce ne sont pas des vêtements d'aujourd'hui.
Ses dents ne sont pas modernes, non plus.
Merde.
Dès que nous avons réalisé le taux
d'infection, nous avons tout fermé.
Combien d'autres sont infectés ?
Trente, peut être quarante.
Tous en quarantaine ?
Normalement, oui, je le pense.
Détruisez leurs vêtements
et leurs papiers immédiatement.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Cette femme n'est pas de ce siècle.
Mais plutôt du 14e.
C'est la... C'est la
putain... de peste noire, Tosh.
Elle a infecté les urgences
de Cardiff avec la peste...
et c'est ma faute.
L'équipe fait des recherches.
Les infectés doivent recevoir
30 mg de Streptomycine,
Chloramphenicol et 2 mg de Tetracycline.
C'est pour la peste. Solutions
standards pour la bubonique.
Bien joué, House.
C'est ce que vous combattez.
Alors qu'est-ce qu'on va faire maintenant ?
Eh bien, c'est un hôpital, vous
avez des procédures, n'est-ce pas ?
Oui, mais tout le monde dit que
Torchwood va régler le problème.
Si nous avons plus de personnes
porteuses qui apparaissent ?
- On travaille pour arrêter ça.
- On vous a attendus !
Vous devez arrêter ça !
Vous devez faire quelque chose !
Non, vous devez faire quelque chose.
Des gens tombent à travers
le temps et amènent
avec eux chaque maladie
de l'histoire à vos portes.
- Donc vous feriez mieux d'être prêts.
- Owen...
Vous n'êtes pas encore assez effrayé ?
Car moi je le suis !
Allez, Tosh !
Assurez-vous qu'ils aient le traitement.
Appelez-nous si les choses empirent.
Comment ça pourrait empirer ?
Owen ?
Owen !
Maman ?
Il arrive... des ténèbres
Qu'est-ce qui arrive ?
S'il n'y a pas d'autre
solution, tu devras le faire.
Faire quoi ?
Maman ?
Tosh ! Viens, arrête de t'inquiéter.
Si Owen a réussi à ouvrir la brèche
pour te ramener avec Tosh,
on ne pourrait pas faire
pareil pour ces gens ?
- On a le contrôleur de la brèche.
- Il y a un monde de différence.
On parle de prendre
le contrôle du temps,
pas de ramener deux personnes du passé.
Par ailleurs, regarde les
dommages causés par Owen.
On a beaucoup plus foiré que ça,
on a mis la planète en danger.
Je t'ai déjà laissé tomber ?
<i>Gwen ?</i>
<i>Gwen ?</i>
Je suis désolé.
Je suis vraiment désolé.
Gwen ?
Gwen ! Allez.
On le pousse !
Tu es sûre que c'était le même gars ?
C'était vraiment lui. Bilis, le
concierge de la salle de danse.
C'est tout ce qu'il a dit,
désolé ? Pourquoi est-il désolé ?
J'entre !
13 rapports de plus de Weevils.
On peut pas suivre à ce rythme.
Tout est en train d'augmenter.
- On peut leur faire arrêter ce bruit ?
- Si tu as une idée de comment.
Peut être qu'ils sont
sensibles au temps. C'est trop.
On est maintenant complet dans
toutes les cellules des 9 niveaux.
Tu veux que j'active les cellules du bas ?
On ne les a jamais utilisées
depuis que je suis ici.
Fais-le.
Gwen, tu as peut-être raison.
Faisons une recherche sur notre
copain de la piste de danse.
- Nous devons le trouver.
- D'accord.
Salut, Ianto.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Pourquoi es-tu là ?
Ce n'est pas en train d'arriver.
Il n'y a qu'une seule façon d'arrêter
ça, avant que les choses n'empirent.
Des gens vont mourir, Ianto.
Des milliers de gens.
A moins que tu n'ouvres la brèche.
Owen. Comment ça s'est
passé à l'hôpital ?
Tu vas rire. Ils ont une
épidémie de Peste Noire.
Quoi ? Oh, mon Dieu !
Ils l'ont sous contrôle ?
Tosh ! Comment ils surmontent ça ?
Hum, Owen a mis le lieu sous quarantaine
et a organisé des traitements
pour ceux qui étaient infectés.
La seule consolation qu'on
ait, c'est qu'il y a un traitement.
Mais qu'est-ce qui va se passer quand
le prochain porteur arrivera, Jack ?
Quelqu'un avec la variole ou l'ebola,
ou autre chose du futur
qu'on ne connaît pas ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait alors ?
Eh bien, ce n'est pas en faisant
des suppositions que ça changera.
On doit être prêt. On est impuissants.
On met juste des pansements
sur des jambes de bois !
Qu'est-ce que tu suggères ?
Je suggère que tu nous guides et que tu
nous dises quelles sont les instructions.
- Owen...
- Non, allez.
Vous le pensez tous aussi.
Tu es le grand homme ici.
Tu gardes tous les secrets.
Eh bien, maintenant c'est le moment de nous
dire comment on se sort de là, bordel !
Tu veux que je te dise un secret ?
Il n'y a pas de solution.
Je ne peux pas réparer ça.
Car ce n'était pas sensé arriver.
La première chose que tu as apprise
était de ne pas ouvrir la brèche.
Mais tu as désobéi à ces ordres.
Et maintenant tout ce qui
se passe est à cause de toi.
Je t'ai seulement désobéi pour te ramener.
- Et maintenant des gens meurent.
- Et je n'aurais pas dû me soucier de toi ?
Qui es-tu de toutes façons, putain ?
Jack Harkness ?
Tu n'existes même pas.
On a vérifié.
Donc si tu n'es même pas
une personne réelle,
alors pourquoi devrais-je
suivre tes ordres ?
- Dégage.
- Quoi ?
Dégage ! Je te relève de tes fonctions.
- Non. Tu ne peux pas faire ça !
- Connard !
Jack, attends.
C'est terminé pour toi.
Quoi, donc ça y est ?
Le monde entier déraille
complètement et tu vas me virer ?
Pour l'Amour de Dieu ! Vous deux !
On doit s'entraider là dessus.
Si je ne peux pas me fier à toi,
si je n'ai pas ton entière confiance,
tu ne fais plus partie de l'équipe.
Et ça vaut pour vous aussi.
Ceux qui sont d'accord avec
Owen, partez immédiatement.
Alors maintenant on sait à quoi s'en tenir.
Donc ça me laisse 24 h pour
savourer les bons moments.
De quoi tu parles ?
Réfléchis, Gwen.
Personne ne part de cet endroit intact.
Dans les prochaines 24 heures...
je deviendrai amnésique.
Toute ma mémoire sera effacée.
Je ne sais pas où ni quand, mais il m'aura.
Jack, c'est allé assez loin.
Donc j'imagine que c'est un adieu.
Bonne chance avec la Fin du Monde.
- Je dirai merci aux souvenirs...
- Jack, pour l'Amour de Dieu !
<i>Ok, les gars, le magasin de Bilis
est à 20 mètres sur votre gauche.</i>
Certaines de ces affaires
doivent remonter à des siècles.
Il récupère des pièces antiques du passé,
les ramène ici, et les vend
pour gagner de l'argent.
Pas une mauvaise affaire.
Nous devons tous gagner notre vie.
Vous venez de 1941.
Tout comme vous. Re-bonjour.
Comment pouvez-vous être à deux
endroit du temps en même temps ?
Je peux traverser les époques comme
vous marcheriez dans une autre pièce.
Au début, c'était le plus incroyable des
dons. Maintenant, je connais la réalité...
c'est une malédiction.
Pourquoi ?
Je peux voir l'histoire entière,
mais je n'en fais pas partie.
Donc, votre retour à
cette époque avait un prix.
Fragmentation du temps.
Cette ville existe sur
une brèche du temps.
Le seul moyen de régler ça est
d'ouvrir complètement cette brèche
laissez-la aspirer ce
qu'elle y a fait tomber.
- Aucune chance. C'est trop dangereux.
- Peut-on vraiment faire ça ?
Bien sûr.
N'est-ce pas, Capitaine ?
- Jack ?
- Tu as vu ce qui s'est passé.
Si on ouvre complètement la brèche,
des millions de vie seront en danger.
Et pourtant, si vous ne le faites
pas, beaucoup plus tomberont.
Des vies seront perdues.
Vous en savez beaucoup,
vous venez avec nous.
Désolé.
Fait chier ! Suis l'activité
temporelle autour de cet endroit.
On doit trouver où il est. Viens.
<i>Gwen.</i>
Je ne suis pas votre ennemi.
Dans les cellules, pourquoi avez-vous
dit que vous étiez désolé ?
Parfois, c'est mieux de vivre
dans l'ignorance... à moins que...
- Voulez-vous vraiment savoir ?
- Savoir quoi ?
Tenez mes mains. Je vais vous montrer.
D'accord.
Seulement si vous êtes sûre.
J'en suis sûre.
Je suis désolé !
Qu'est-ce que vous venez de me montrer ?
Le futur.
Qu'est-ce qui t'as pris si longtemps ?
Gwen ?
Gwen !
C'est toi ?
Ouais... c'est moi.
Ah ! Tu nettoies le four !
- Oui, quelqu'un doit le faire, mon amour.
- Ecoute, on dois partir.
- Pourquoi, qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
- On doit partir, c'est tout.
- Laisse-moi finir ça d'abord...
- Rhys, on doit partir. Maintenant !
Ah, c'est reparti, toujours pressée depuis
que tu as commencé ce foutu travail...
Je suis désolée.
<i>Owen.</i>
Owen.
Oh... mon Dieu.
Diane...
Oh, mon Dieu.
Je suis perdue, Owen.
Je peux te toucher. Je ne comprends pas.
- Où as-tu atterri ?
- S'il te plaît.
Ramène-moi, Owen.
Tu peux faire ça, hein ?
Je ne sais pas.
- Tout est hors de contrôle.
- S'il te plaît.
S'il te plaît, ramène-moi.
Ouvre la brèche.
Vous voulez un autre verre, mon gars ?
<i>Can it call you or maul you</i>
<i>And drive you insane</i>
<i>Can it make you remember</i>
<i>Time is in place</i>
<i>Now I'm begging you</i>
<i>I'm begging you...</i>
- Reste calme.
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Je rêve ?
C'est là où je travaille.
- Tu travailles dans une prison ?
- Ce sont juste les cellules.
Tu m'as enfermé dans une cellule ?
Bordel, à quoi tu joues ?
J'essaye juste de te garder sain et sauf.
- J'étais sain et sauf à la maison !
- Non.
Vraiment pas.
Ecoute, Gwen,
tu ferais mieux de me dire
exactement ce qui se passe
car j'ai accumulé pas
mal les derniers mois.
Qu'est-ce que c'est que tout ça ?
Rhys, écoute-moi, il faut que
tu me fasses confiance.
Ok, ça ne ressemble peut
être pas à ça en ce moment,
mais j'essaye juste
de prendre soin de toi.
Je t'aime, mon coeur.
Qu'est-ce que c'était, bordel ?
Essaye juste de te calmer,
je reviendrai te chercher.
Comment ça ?
Tu ne vas pas me laisser là !
- Je suis désolée.
- Gwen ! Gwen !
Je suis désolée.
Fais chier !
- Il est réveillé ?
- Ouais. Oui, il l'est.
Tosh, peux-tu connecter
la CCTV des cellules ?
Laisse-le juste sur l'écran, je
sais que ça semble fou, mais...
- Bien sûr, aucun problème.
- Merci... de m'avoir aidé à l'amener.
Je ne comprends pas comment Bilis a
été capable de te montrer cette vision.
C'était tellement réel, Tosh.
J'étais dans mon appartement.
Ca sentait mon appartement, ça
avait les sons de mon appartement.
J'ai touché le sang. Je peux encore le
sentir sur mes mains. Le sang de Rhys.
Ca ne va pas arriver.
Allez, on a encore du travail.
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- On a une faille de sécurité.
D'accord, que personne ne panique.
Rhys !
Oh, vous travaillez ici ?
Je m'appelle Rhys...
...le copain de Gwen.
NON !
Non !
Il est mort ! Il est
mort ! S'il te plaît...
Non ! S'il te plaît !
Non ! S'il te plaît !
Rhys !
On peut... on peut le ramener !
- On ne peut rien faire.
- Si ! Mon chéri.
Qu'est-ce que je vais devenir ?
Qu'est-ce que je vais devenir ?
Non !
Non !
Je vais devoir le dire à sa famille.
On s'en occupera.
De la même façon que ce gardien,
la première fois où je vous ai rencontré ?
Non...
vous ne vous en occuperez pas, Ianto.
Gwen, je suis vraiment désolée.
Vous ne l'avez jamais rencontré.
C'est ce qui se passe ici.
On finit tout seul.
Pas moi.
Certainement pas.
- Ramène-le.
- Non.
Le gant de résurrection...
- A été détruit.
- Quelque chose d'autre.
J'ai dit non.
Non, il y a quelque chose
qui cloche avec le temps,
donc on peut retourner au bon moment...
Gwen...
On peut faire quelque chose,
sinon A QUOI TU SERS PUTAIN ?!
Non, tu le ramènes !
Ramènes-le !
- Gwen.
- Ramènes-le !
TU ME COMPRENDS, PUTAIN
DE JACK HARKNESS ?
- Je suis désolé.
- Vraiment ?
Je suis vraiment désolé.
Je suis désolé.
Oh, merde.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
- Tu es revenu !
- Ca va ?
Ne me touche pas !
Combien d'autres personnes
doivent souffrir ?
Je vais régler ça.
J'ouvre la brèche.
Assure-toi de l'arrêter.
Non.
On va l'aider.
Bilis avait raison,
il a dit d'ouvrir la brèche et que
tout redeviendrait à la normale.
Owen a raison.
Je vais ramener Rhys.
- Gwen.
- Non !
Gwen !
J'entre le protocole d'urgence N° 1.
Bouge, je vais le faire.
Eloigne-toi de cet ordinateur, Gwen.
Jack...
C'est un piège.
Toutes les fissures, ce sont des
diversions. C'est ce que Bilis veut.
De quoi tu as peur, Jack ?
Rhea Silva.
J'ai dit, "Eloigne-toi".
- Qu'est-ce que tu fous, bordel ?!
- Dernier avertissement.
- Allez, Jack.
- Tu fais front uni maintenant ?
Toshiko,
la pauvre fille qui baise avec un alien
qui lui a donné un pendentif ?
Owen, si fort, il va dans une cage avec
un Weevil, désespéré à être molesté.
Ou Ianto, cachant sa cyber
petite amie dans la cave.
Tes trois camarades lui on tiré
dessus, tu t'en rappelles ?
Je dois ramener Rhys.
Ouais...
car tu es si amoureuse de lui que tu passes
la moitié de ton temps dans le lit d'Owen.
Va te faire foutre !
On vous relève de vos
fonctions, "Capitaine".
On va ramener ce qu'on a perdu !
EMPREINTES RETINIENNES DE TOUT LE PERSONNEL
NECESSAIRES POUR AUTORISATION
Fais chier !
Reste à terre !
Tu es aux commandes, Owen ?
Tu dois avoir de plus grosses couilles.
J'en ai marre des gens
qui doutent de moi.
Qu'est-ce que tu as fait ?
On doit encore faire celles de Jack.
ATTENTION
L'ACTIVATION DU PROTOCOLE VA
METTRE EN DANGER LES INFRASTRUCTURES
Oh, mon Dieu !
Qu'est-ce que tu as fait ?
Aide-moi à le déplacer !
- Continuez d'avancer !
- Ca va aller, Jack.
Tout va revenir à la normale.
D'au-delà des ténèbres, il est venu.
De quoi il parle ?
Fils de la Grande Bête,
chassé avant l'heure,
enchaîné aux rochers et
emprisonné sous la brèche.
Quoi ?!
Acclamez tous Abaddon,
le Grand Dévoreur.
Viens festoyer de la vie.
Le monde entier périra
sous ses ténèbres.
Je t'ai regardé, mon Dieu,
sache que mon travail est fait.
Comment on l'arrête ?
Dis-moi quoi faire, Jack.
Juste toi...
Emmène-moi à un endroit ouvert.
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Si Abaddon est la
personnification de la mort,
voyons comment il se comporte avec moi.
S'il se nourrit de la vie,
alors je suis un buffet complet.
Non, attends ! Attends, tu es trop faible !
Bouge de là !
VAS-Y !
- Roule aussi vite que tu peux.
- Jack !
Amène-toi !
- Tu es là !
- Tu n'étais pas
là il y a une minute ?
Tu es là !
Vas au lit.
Dors un peu...
et je reviendrai te voir.
Tu es sûr ?
Il est gelé.
Aucun signe vital.
Il a survécu quand
tu lui as tiré dessus.
La première fois que je vous ai rejoints,
il a dit qu'il ne pouvait pas mourir.
Il avait tort.
Je veux m'asseoir avec lui.
Gwen...
Je veux m'asseoir avec lui.
Réveille-toi.
Jack.
Combien de temps elle va faire ça ?
Ca fait des jours.
On doit faire face.
Il ne reviendra pas.
Je crois en lui.
Laisse-le partir, Gwen.
Merci.
- Je...
- Je te pardonne.
Qu'est-ce qui est arrivé à la brèche ?
Elle s'est fermée quand
Abaddon a été détruit.
Mais ça va être plus
volatile que jamais.
Les visions qu'on a eues.
On a tous vu des gens qu'on aimait.
Qu'est-ce que tu as vu ?
Rien.
Il n'y avait rien.
Jack...
Qu'est-ce qui t'a tenté ?
Quelles visions t'auraient
convaincu d'ouvrir la brèche ?
Le bon genre de Docteur.
Jack... ?
Où ils en sont avec ces cafés ?
Jack ?
Jack ?
- Vous avez vu Jack en entrant ?
- Non.
Je pensais qu'on avait rangé ici !
Quel est le problème ?
Hum... il était juste ici.
Quelque chose l'a
emporté. Jack est parti.

La Harkness Team vous dit
à bientôt pour la saison 2.
Come on, Tyler. Tyler, just stop it.
I haven't got time to muck around.
Tyler! All right, I'll just leave
you there. Is that what you want?
If I just leave you?
In the middle of town?
We're going to be late.
Suzette! Stop it, you're just
looking silly, d'you want other
people to see you, looking silly?.
If he gives you any more trouble,
your dad's going to punch
his face in.
I'll punch his bloody mother.
Have you got that, David?
I've booked the car for 7.30, but I
might have to leave it on standby.
If Baxter starts talking,
he never stops, so I can't
guarantee what time.
I'll tell you what, I'll send you
a text when I'm on the motorway.
Steven!
if you leave the front door open,
those cats are going to get in.
Darling, don't just stand there,
you're gonna be late.
Steven.
Steven?
Stop playing games!
Get out of the way!
CAR HORNS BLARE
Oi! I said bloody shift, man!
David? Are you listening to me?
Mica? Oi, you two! Look at me!
See ya then!
And you can shut up an' all,
you were the one crying, you
were like a baby, I seen you.
Was not. Was. Was not.
You two, you're gonna be late.
We're going! Look!
I'm going round to
Polly's later, see ya, bye!
What? You are pushing it,
you are, young man. Come on!
All right, Glyn? What's occurring?
I've been watching the bay.
No sea monsters. Ah, still early.
Anyone in?
You two having shenanigans
in the dark? Jack?
Morning.
Clear! And again! Charging 200.
Clear!
MONITOR FLATLINES
I think we should call it,
everyone agree?
OK. Time of death, 09.17.
Sally, I can leave it with you,
yeah? I'll go and tell them.
I'm sorry.
We did everything we could,
but he didn't make it.
Oh, that's a shame.
Very sad. Poor old Mr Williams.
Very sad indeed.
There'll have to be an autopsy,
but I'd say his heart gave out.
Brave old heart.
You were neighbours, is that right?
We live next door.
He's got no family to speak of.
All on his own. We'd just keep an
eye on him, y'know.
Well, I'm sure he appreciated it.
If only there were more like
you two in the world.
I know it's an imposition, but with
us being such good neighbours...
Can we see the body?
Bless him. God rest his soul.
Say, d'you think we could, er...?
Just on our own, um...
Course you can.
Just come and find me,
once you're done.
And I'm sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
He thought we were together.
Like a couple. He said, "You two."
The way he said it, huh. "You two."
Well, we are. Does it matter?
I dunno, it's all a bit
new to me, that's all.
Laser saw. Thank you.
Tongs. Tongs.
Almost...
..got it.
Sorry, one more....
There! What?
Now, look at it, that's not human,
is it, does that look human?
No, it does not.
It's just a hitchhiker he
picked up, it didn't kill him.
Some say they're positively
beneficial, they release endorphins.
He died a happy man.
And I've got Tupperware.
And we're very considerate,
we don't leave any mess.
Thank you very much.
We'll just get out of your way.
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
Whatever it was, that was
mutilation, I should report you.
Then why don't you?
But that thing, what the
hell was it, that hitchhiker?
Try putting it into a report.
You're Torchwood?
Never heard of 'em.
There are bodies going missing!
How many?
This whole city talks about you.
What bodies, where?
It started two months ago.
Bodies, taken down to the mortuary,
then the records just stop.
Five of them. Five in two months.
And none of them white.
One of West Indian decent, one
African, three Chinese, all male.
What was your name again? Rupesh.
Rupesh Patanjali.
What d'you think? NHS.
Yeah. Too much red tape.
Sorry. But good luck with it!
Don't! Look, wait a minute!
Oh, Christ. Good morning, sir.
Morning. Morning to you, too.
Colonel Oduya for you, sir.
Unscheduled.
I'd remind you, you've got the
Category Meeting at quarter past.
You'd better come through.
Thank you.
I'm late!
I'm sorry! Oh, my God, I'm really,
really sorry! Good morning.
Bridget Spears. Lois Habiba.
Right. This will be your desk.
Just tell me it's something small.
Tell me it's a... It's a meteorite!
Or a shadow on the moon.
Just for once, tell me it's easy.
Might be nothing, sir.
But it's my job to inform the
Government, even if it turns
out to be a false alarm.
Then what is it?
Children, sir. It's the children.
You are gonna get us killed!
No, you get killed, not me. You'd
die like a dog, like an ugly dog!
Oi, Chuckle Brothers.
I found something.
I want a check on
St Helen's Hospital morgue.
There's a computer, do it yourself.
I've got reports this morning of
17 traffic accidents,
happening across the country,
from Glasgow to St Ives.
Is that above average?
Well, they all occurred between 8.40
and 8.41. 17 road traffic accidents
happening in exactly the same minute?
Every single one of
them involving children.
That'll be the school run. All of
them were just standing in the road.
Not crossing the road, just standing.
I saw it myself, Jack.
Two kids on Market Street.
Well, they just stopped.
But the accidents are
just one part of a picture.
Because every other child stopped at
the same time. And not just
in Britain.
Same reports from France.
15 road traffic accidents.
All timed around 9.40. They're an
hour ahead, so it was simultaneous.
All involving children? Yup. Hold
on. Cross-referencing. Here we go.
Reports coming in, RTAs in Norway.
Sweden. Denmark. Luxembourg.
Germany.
India. Egypt.
Guyana.
Spain. Portugal. Bosnia. Tokyo.
Singapore. At 8.40 GMT,
most of America was asleep,
but even there, we're
beginning to get reports.
I think we can assume
it's all of them, sir.
As far as we can tell, at 8.40
this morning, every single
child in the world stopped.
Seen anything like this before, Jack?
No way. Kids?
Until we receive further
information, we don't know if
it's extraterrestrial in origin.
Though the United Nations
has taken UNIT up to yellow
alert, just in case. Bloody hell.
And Colonel Mace?
How is he getting on? He's fine.
Wouldn't mind a
post in Vancouver myself.
Wonderful countryside, so they say.
Nice for some.
Sorry. My name's Lois, Lois Habiba.
Just started today. I'm helping
out Miss Spears while they
introduce the new computer system.
Thank you.
All done. What's his uniform?
That's not British Army, is it?
If you could start transferring
the names and addresses.
You have two
daughters, is that right?
Yeah. Maybe I should get them home
from school. I'd be careful, sir.
I wouldn't do anything
to draw any attention.
Right now, this thing's random
enough to go unnoticed,
and if anyone files a news report,
we'll be crushing it.
But, so far, we're the only ones
with the software clever enough
to piece this all together.
Well, us and Torchwood.
D'you want me to talk to them?
They're a pain in the backside,
but they can be helpful.
We're on to them, right now.
OK, find out anything,
let me know immediately.
Of all the times for Martha Jones to
go on holiday. I get Sergeant Grunt.
I'm talking to a sergeant! Don't you
dare phone her, she's
on her honeymoon.
What did they say? UNIT base in
Washington has run
some tests on a couple of kids.
Brain scans, blood sugar,
checking for radiation. Nothing.
You were right! He's back!
Ha! Ha! I said so!
Who's back?
What's he doing?
Waiting. Just like you said.
He's been there 20 minutes.
Persistent. Good sign.
Dogmatic. Always a plus.
Oh, Christ, never work with
a couple - you two talk like twins!
Now tell me who he is.
Rupesh Patanjali.
He saw the hitchhiker,
he's the bodies-going-missing man.
Dr Patanjali.
We need a doctor.
You let just him follow you?
Ask about Torchwood, and most
people point towards the Bay. Oh.
You bastards, that's exactly what
you did to me the first time we met!
Well, sod that, I'm promoting
myself to recruitment officer!
She's calling us a couple now.
What's your problem?
Just saying.
I hate the word "couple".
Me too.
Hey.
Rupesh, isn't it? Yeah.
Gwen Cooper.
I'm Torchwood.
Three of the bodies were Chinese?
Were they related?
No, one was 27-years-old
and the other two were in their 50s.
But not from the same family.
Bit odd, though, statistically.
In a city this small.
That's what I thought. Mind you.
Nothing compared to that hitchhiker.
Freak you out?
Oh, yeah! Yeah, me too.
Apparently, anyone could have one.
Don't! I know! This place!
Ever since I moved here,
it's just weird.
Where you from then?
Me? I'm from Chesterfield.
Came down here, 18 months back.
Enjoying it? Very much, yeah.
I bet it doesn't pay you much though.
Not at first. Could be worse.
Torchwood's paid by the Crown.
First pay cheque, I almost fell over.
Had to hide it from my boyfriend.
I was buying clothes, had
to stash them under the bed.
What's it like, inside Torchwood,
I mean, what do you do?
Why are you so interested? Well.
From what I've heard,
it sounds... I dunno.
Exciting? I suppose. Glamorous?
No, more, sort of...
The thing is, we've all seen it now,
the past few years. Alien life.
Even though half the
world's still denying it.
For me...
OK.
It's the suicides.
The past few years,
suicide rates have doubled, and
that's ever since the first alien.
My first case,
my first death, was a suicide.
D'you know why she did it?
Cos she'd written all these letters,
she'd been a Christian all her life,
and then alien life appears.
She wrote this bit, she said,
"It's like science has won."
Lost her faith.
More than that.
She said she saw her
place in the universe,
and it was tiny.
She died because
she thought she was nothing.
I went through that.
Even now, I get terrified.
But at the same time,
it is brilliant, and beautiful,
and completely bloody magic.
It's bigger, y'know? It's like...
It's like the whole
wide world is bigger.
My life is bigger.
Shit!
Sasha, love, I haven't got time.
I've got to be in work.
Jack! Get up here!
It's happening again! The children!
They're doing it again!
Are you all right? We're fine, she's
just playing a game. OK.
Now come on, sweetheart,
people are staring at you!
Sasha, stop it.
HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING
What's she doing? I don't know!
Sasha! Stop it! Please help her!
There's another one!
It's all right,
it's all right, I'm a doctor.
SCREAMING STOPS
We. We. We.
We. We. We. We.
We. We. Whoa!
We are. We are. We are. We are.
We are. We are coming.
We are coming. Oh, my God!
We are coming.
We are coming. We are coming.
Who's got children? Find me
a kid, find me a bloody kid, now!
He won't stop, he keeps
saying the same thing,
over and over.
We are coming. We are coming.
We are coming. We are coming.
We are coming.
We are coming. Sasha, please,
my God!
Who are you? Who's coming?
Come on then.
Why is that man filming us?
Are we gonna be on telly?
You all right?
They've found me.
Gwen, I'll get on to
the Home Office.
This has gone public. They're gonna
need us. Whoa! Where'd you think
you're going?
Um. I dunno. I could help.
Doing what? You're bleeping.
Shit, yeah, sorry.
Whole city's coming to a standstill,
they're gonna need you in A&E.
We'll get back to you, I promise.
What's in there? Big science-fiction
superbase.
Honestly! See ya.
I'm sorry, we've got no comment.
Can we leave it for now?
I'm sorry, he's not
seeing anyone at the moment.
The Home Secretary's demanding
information, sir...
No, I'm sorry I don't know
who that is. I'm new.
Anyone else, just tell them
no, Bridget. No more calls.
I'll have to abandon the press
list, can you set up an autoreply?
You'll have to get into my account,
that's the username, spears,
password Hastings, capital H, rest
of it lower case. Right.
Bridget, I want to see Mr Frobisher.
Will you excuse me, please.
Sir? I said, no-one.
Mr Dekker, sir.
Four, five, six.
I warned you.
Tell him it's Captain Jack
Harkness, he'll take the call.
I'm sorry, I can't. If you
could just leave your number or...
'Tell him it's Torchwood.'
Right, and how do you spell that?
You work for the Home Office
and you've never heard of Torchwood?
I'm new. Started today.
Just what I need!
Sorry. Not your fault.
You picked a hell of a day.
'Just tell him Torchwood,
W-O-O-D.'
We might be able to help, OK?
What was your name?
Lois, Lois Habiba.
Good luck to you, Lois Habiba.
Right. Too many people here...
Been a while since we
had visitors down here.
Thought you'd forgotten about us.
It's hardly the glamorous side
of Thames House, my little domain.
We converted the readings
onto digital, years ago,
but I kept the original equipment.
Call it nostalgia.
Then this morning it woke up.
8.40, and again at 10.30,
transmitting on the 456.
WHOOSHING AND WHIRRING
Just five seconds in duration.
But that's enough. What's it saying?
Well, I think it's a burst of
compressed information.
I'm running it through the
translators, might take a while.
But the point is,
the 456 was open.
But why would they change?
That's your job, to find out.
I'll have to tell the Prime Minister.
Elected officials?!
They just come and go.
The 456 was here before him,
it'll be here long after he's gone.
And so will we.
The Civil Service, John,
the cockroaches of government.
Have you got kids?
Too busy working.
Turns out to be a Godsend.
So I think it's a transmission,
a pulse, a broadcast.
Like the Mosquito alarm - the
one that only kids can hear.
Unique to prepubescents.
Maybe testosterone interferes
with the signal, and oestrogen...
Oh, no, no, no, hold on.
We're being dumbos, we're missing
the bleedin' obvious here, look.
Recorded in Taiwan.
The point being, anyone?
We are coming. We are coming.
It's English.
They're speaking English. Exactly!
And all the footage is the same.
So every single child in the whole
wide world is speaking English,
so why's that?
I guess if you scanned the Earth
from the outside, you'd register
English as the dominant language.
That would be Chinese - Mandarin.
There's a billion people
speaking Mandarin.
That's three times more than
English. Oh, my God. What?
OK, ready? So every single child in
the world is talking in unison, yeah?
Yeah. Yup.
Every single child... And one man.
We are coming. We are coming.
What the hell? Who's he?
Name's Timothy White. He's a patient
in a psychiatric ward at the Duke Of
York Hospital, East Grinstead.
How did you get this footage?
Staff e-mailed it to the police.
But every police force is swamped
with mums and dads going absolutely
mental, so it's just waiting in line.
I reckon no-one else has
noticed him yet. East Grinstead.
That's what, two hours? I'm on it!
'I know I promised, shut up.
Change of plan.'
Oh, s'all right, I thought
you'd be busy. "We are coming!"
Eh, but what's it like?
The estate agent hasn't turned up.
Fair dos, she's probably got kids.
So, what do you think's causing it?
I can't say. Top secret.
You haven't got a clue, have you?
No idea.
Tell you what, it looks nice from
the outside. I reckon we could knock
ten grand off the asking price.
Three bedrooms.
One could be a nursery.
Oh, stop it! One day!
You can adopt a Filipino and get
her to clean the chimneys. I was
thinking though, right?
Those kids went off at 8.40, when
everyone's on their way to school,
then at 10.30, that's break time.
It's like it was timed.
So you'd get maximum kids out in
the open, visible to everyone.
Suppose. Yeah, but that means
it's timed around Britain.
Specific British hours, yeah?
It might be worldwide, but I reckon
someone's looking right at us.
That's brilliant. That is brilliant,
you're not bad, you, are you?
I'm bloody superb.
Oh, my God, Severn Bridge!
I'm going into England!
Farewell forever!
Good luck! Have you got currency?
Yes, and I've had my injections!
See ya!
Lunch time.
This place should be
buzzing with kids.
Everyone's taken them home.
We need a child.
Cos we need to test
those frequencies.
Find the right frequency, and we can
find out who's transmitting.
Where d'you get a child, though?
I could find you lasers and
weevils and hitchhikers.
But kids...
See you later.
Where are you going?
Now who's a couple?
When I was a kid, it was the bomb.
Iron Curtain. Reds under the bed.
It was all so bloody simple.
Now it comes raining
down from the skies.
Made of metal,
stinking green and God knows what.
I find myself running a
country under siege from above.
What d'you recommend that we do?
You tell me. Given that this
is now worldwide, Prime Minister,
it might be best if certain
historical events were taken
off the record.
So Britain gets a clean sheet?
Yes, sir.
How do we know if these...what do we
call them?
The 456. They never gave a name.
We just called them the 456
after the frequency allocation.
Then how do we know that the
456 will keep quiet? We don't.
All we can do is hope
to cover ourselves.
You'll have to issue a Blank Page.
No.
Then, what do we do?
I'm not having my name on this.
You never told me.
I was never a part of it.
I never knew.
Is that understood?
Yes, sir.
Then I take it that that
leaves the Blank Page with me?
Just don't tell me about it.
Tell her it's in the bottom drawer,
I put them there yesterday, yeah?
Oh, I thought so.
Good to see you.
How's things? Terrifying.
Uncle Jack!
Steven! Hey, soldier, how you doing?
I was talking like an alien!
Everyone was! It was brilliant!
You'd better come in.
CAR ALARM BEEPS
Only me. Oh, bloody hell.
We must be in trouble.
Or is it Christmas? How are they?
Yeah, it was a bit of a scare.
I brought them home, just in case.
I reckon it's that group hysteria
thing, like when lots of girls all
faint at the same time.
Did you say thanks to your uncle?
I did.
David! Your Uncle Ianto's here!
I was thinking.
I missed Mica's birthday.
I thought I could take her
to McDonald's.
That's all of Ł3.95, you big spender.
All right, cinema.
Yeah, that'd be nice.
You'd like that, wouldn't you, Mica?
I thought maybe this afternoon.
No chance. What about Saturday?
I'm kind of busy on Saturday. You're
a civil servant, they don't work
weekends. They invented weekends.
And I'm not having her going out, not
today, not with all that voice thing.
I want 'em where I can see them.
But she'll be with me.
She's staying put.
Right. Fine. Just an idea.
I won't bother you.
Oh, that's it, is it?
You're just gonna go now?
Oh, sit down, you daft sod. I've
got some of that spinach dip.
And you and me, well,
we've got things to talk about.
What things? You've been seen.
They said on the news that
we should send them back to school
tomorrow. D'you think it's safe?
Well, I don't know
any more than you.
Oh, come on.
I don't.
Any word from Joe?
In Italy.
With her.
They finally got married.
But he, er...
He phones every now and then,
and sends Steven postcards.
Remembers his birthday.
There are worse fathers.
How are you off for money?
Don't worry about that.
You give me enough.
Kind of easy, writing cheques, huh?
Alice, you're the one
who asked me to stay away.
I'd come round here every week,
if you wanted me to.
Every day.
Yeah.
I just can't stand it, Dad.
I look older than you do
and it's never gonna stop.
I get older and older
and you stay the same.
One day, you're gonna be
standing at my funeral.
Looking just like you did when
you were standing at Mum's.
No wonder she was so furious.
You make us feel old.
Actually, I found a grey hair.
Oh!
Well, that is the end of the world.
You ever gonna tell him?
What do I say?
That you're his grandfather?
He's too young to notice, right now.
That I don't age. But one day,
he's gonna realise.
And that's another reason
for you to stay away.
I suppose.
I could make the most of it while
he's still young. Take him out.
Buy him stuff.
Me and him, sort of thing.
You mean today?
While I'm here, may as well.
You bastard. Something happens
to kids, and you want to spend
time with him on the same day.
You are not experimenting
on that boy, Dad. Not ever.
That's why I want you to
stay away, because you're dangerous.
Dr Patanjali. You were paging me?
Rupesh! Captain Jack Harkness.
You've got a children's ward,
haven't you? I need a kid.
Susan on the corner was in town
and it was her anniversary,
so they went to that posh
French place by the memorial,
and there was you.
So...?
There was you, having dinner
with a man. So?
Having dinner, with a man,
in a restaurant.
So? You have dinner with Tina.
Not in town.
Susan said he was gorgeous.
Like a film star.
Like an escort.
He's my boss.
She said it was intimate.
I said, "Well, he's had girlfriends,"
and she said, "Well, no girl
was getting her feet round
that table, no chance."
Have you gone bender?
Mica's hearing this.
She's not bothered.
Her friend Sian's got two mothers.
Go on.
You never tell me
anything these days.
Dad died, that was it, you were off.
You couldn't wait.
Like I did something wrong.
I didn't, did I?
It's not that.
It's my job, it's difficult, it's...
He is very handsome. No!
Now stop it. You're kidding me!
Really, though?
Really?
Christ almighty!
He's nice, though? Is he?
Is he? Oh, my God.
I mean, since when?
It's weird,
it's just different.
It's not...men.
It's just him.
It's only him.
And I don't even
know what it is, really.
So... So I'm not broadcasting it.
Oh, no, honest, I won't say.
If you want it kept quiet, I swear,
I won't say a word, I promise.
Aye aye, gay boy, she says
you're taking it up the arse.
Mica, will you get off that thing.
Thanks. How've you been then,
you smart bastard?
CAR ALARM WAILS
Eh, whose car is that outside,
is that you? Black thing?
That's the company car. You want
to watch it on this estate, boy.
No, it's fine,
it's got a triple-deadlock.
Oh, aye, sounds like it.
CAR ALARM AND TYRES SCREECHING
Oh!
But it's got a triple
deadlock, they can't have!
They drive round the block, then
they come back for a lap of honour.
The victory parade!
We should phone the police.
It's more fun this way.
Right, here they come! Get ready!
Yay! David! Get inside! Now!
That's my car! I'm not telling
you again, get inside. I'll take
your computer off you, get in.
That's my car.
Timothy White. 52 years old.
He's been with us three months.
But he's got a history of being
in and out of care all his life.
Timothy White's.
My mum used to shop there.
If he's got a different name,
he's never said.
He spent 40 years living
in Leeds, that's where
he first came on record.
Found homeless, living on
the streets, at the age of 11.
11, bloody hell.
No-one ever reported him missing.
Apparently though, he did have
a Scottish accent, back then.
Gone now,
but he was a long way lost.
Can you remember the voice?
You said, "We are coming."
Can you remember why?
D'you know what I think it was?
Aliens.
There's no such thing.
Those days are gone.
I don't mean to scare you, because
you're perfectly safe, but I think
aliens are using you to speak.
What d'you think?
No such thing. Isn't it, isn't it?
I've met aliens.
It's part of my job.
But I'm not the authorities,
or the police, or the army.
So anything you say
is just between me and you.
And I will believe you.
Give me your hand.
You're telling the truth.
How can you tell? I can smell it.
You've...met them?
Dozens of them.
Still not safe.
Isn't it, isn't it?
They're watching.
Well, I can do something about that.
Shh, shh.
What's that thing?
The technical name is a gizmo.
HE LAUGHS
Isn't it?
I think you've seen aliens too.
What's your name?
What's your REAL name?
When did you last say your name?
Never. Then tell me. I was a kid.
What happened?
They took us out.
In the night. In the dark.
Isn't it? Isn't it?
They told us, they said we were
going to a new home.
Who did, who said?
The staff. A care home?
They drove us
away for miles and miles.
HIGH-PITCHED GIGGLING
They were there.
In the sky. What did they look like?
Light.
The light...
..took them.
Took who? My friends. But not you?
I ran.
There was something,
there was people, there was..
Isn't it, isn't it,
isn't it, isn't it?
You're all right,
you're safe. OK?
You're safe now.
But they're coming back.
I've been smelling them for months.
In the air.
Long time coming.
Tim, I can help. Look at me.
I can help.
If kids went missing, something's got
to be written down
and I will find it.
But to do that,
I need to know your name.
I was Clem.
Clement MacDonald.
Hi, Clem.
Hi.
Where were you from?
It was somewhere in Scotland,
do you remember?
Holly Tree. Holly Tree,
is that a town, or a place, or...?
The Holly Tree. Is that
where it happened? Clem?
What was the Holly Tree?
What was the Holly Tree?
You're pregnant.
Sorry?
Yes, you are. No, I don't think so.
Yes. I can smell it. Three weeks.
Oh... Bloody hell,
I've been running.
That camera's gone off,
it just went dead!
Still. No harm done, eh?
Everything all right?
Yes. I'm fine, thank you.
Right, well,
I think you've had long enough.
Time for your meds, isn't it, Tim?
If you don't mind. No.
Congratulations.
Ianto, I need a search on Clement
MacDonald, could be M-C or M-A-C,
and try the words "Holly Tree"
and Scotland. We're looking
at the 1960s, got that?
Yeah. Then try the words Timothy
White, with the option of Timothy
White's, apostrophe S, like the shop.
I lost the car.
Yeah, and if you find anything,
let me know, don't wait for
me to get back. Kids nicked it.
Yeah, I'll see you later.
I've got a red flag on a
Torchwood intercept, the name
Clement MacDonald, can you trace it?
Roger, Ashton, control
initiating trace now.
You'll find the names under 456.
And what d'you want me to do?
I promise, we can zap these kid's
memories so they won't remember,
no side effects.
There's been another death.
Mr Chow Lee Jee, Chinese again.
He came in with a nosebleed
that wouldn't stop.
Next thing you know, it's been
diagnosed as a brain haemorrhage,
he died at 16.25.
Sorry, he's with me.
Dr Patanjali, A&E.
We just need
to check Mr Chow Lee Jee.
Well, he hasn't gone missing.
I can see that.
Need to run a toxicology scan.
Not on the NHS,
we've got much better equipment.
Pupil's blown, that corresponds
with a brain haemorrhage, though
it could be induced artificially.
No sign of trauma to the skin,
apart from bruising, but...
GUNSHOT
Get them in.
Seal off the area.
The name Clement MacDonald hasn't
been active for 44 years,
but here he is.
Torchwood's found him under
the name of Timothy White.
That's way beyond coincidence.
Bring him in.
Who changed the plan?
I spent months researching that.
And they believed me!
Perfect infiltration, I thought
you wanted me inside Torchwood to
see what they've got in there.
Who killed the Chinese man?
I did, I had to, it was perfect
timing, he just fitted the story.
Then get off your high horse, yeah?
Any sign yet?
Not so far.
D'you think it's true?
What they say about him?
He was dead.
Now he's dead again. And we'll
keep killing him till he's ready.
Get him prepared. Yes, Ma'am.
How the hell does he do it?
No-one knows. Theory would suggest
it's connected to the Torchwood Hub.
That Rift thing.
Which makes the whole place a target.
What changed the orders?
The children.
Seal him up. Closing down.
Everybody out!
Put him back where he was.
He'll wonder where I've gone.
How do we cover that?
How d'you mean?
Well, he's gonna try and trace me.
You're not disappearing.
Yeah, but I've got to, he's gonna...
Sides!
Oh, no.
Result! There was a Holly Tree Lodge
just outside Arbroath.
It's a hotel now, but, up until
1965, it was a state-run orphanage.
And they had a Clement MacDonald!
He was taken into care,
April 1965, after his mother died.
No father on record.
In November 1965, he was
transferred, along with... Oh.
Over to control. Harkness now
approaching door one, over.
He's inside! We don't know how deep
that place goes. Give it five. Over.
We need damage control
at St Helen's. One body.
Dr Rupesh Patanjali.
Shot in the back. What happened?
I don't know. He was just
left there right beside me.
Like someone's gloating.
Did they kill you? Yeah.
Maybe we're being targeted.
Whether it was him or me, we should
be careful, better tell Gwen.
She's back, she's in the lab. Gwen!
Boy, have I had a day.
Oh, my God. Is that...?
How long? Three weeks.
That's good, isn't it?
From where I'm standing it...
looks good to me.
Yeah.
Bloody hell.
It's brilliant!
Ianto! We're having a baby!
Have you told Rhys?
I've only just found out myself.
Oh, you told me before you
told him, he is gonna love that.
Congratulations.
Would now be a good time to tell
you I lost the car? You did what?!
That is so bloody spectacular!
But what about this place,
and my job?
We'll manage. We always do.
SIREN
What the hell is that?
Oh, my God.
There's a bomb,
there's a bomb inside your stomach.
Get out, both of you.
It has a blast radius of one mile!
Right now! Look there must be
something we can do. We can stop it.
We can fix this OK, we can rip it out
of you. I'm telling you. Get out!
It's active. Two minutes!
I can't just run, Jack.
You're pregnant.
We are coming.
We are coming. John! John!
We are coming. We are coming.
We are coming. We are coming.
We are coming. We are coming.
We are coming. We are coming.
Ianto, you're going to get
locked inside.
'Torchwood - lockdown.'
Ianto! We can override the
mechanism. For God's sake, get out!
There'll be nothing left of you!
I can survive anything.
RECORDED VOICE:
'Torchwood - lockdown.'
'Torchwood - lockdown.'
I'll come back. I always do.
Stop it, Stephen. Stop it.
We are coming. Stop it!
We are coming. We are coming.
We are coming. Stop it! Stop it!
We are coming. We are coming.
We are coming...back.
What's going on, like?
Someone is trying to kill me.
If they're after me,
they'll come after you.
Call me when you've got them.
And get them quick. Gwen!
It's all to do with aliens and
they'll be here tomorrow.
We are coming.
And why do they want you dead?
We're building something and we
don't even know what it is?
It's for them.

We are coming. Every child in
the world is speaking English.
We are coming.
And one man.
You're pregnant.
Have you told Rhys?
I've only just found out myself.
He is going to love that.
We are coming.
This morning it woke up.
Transmitting on the 456.
It's a transmission,
a pulse, a broadcast.
We are coming.You never
tell me anything these days.
Dad died, that was it.
He is very handsome.
You're kidding me? Really though?
We are coming.It might be best if certain
historical events were taken off the record.
You never told me. I
was never a part of it.
There's a bomb in your stomach.
Stop it! Stop it! We are coming.
John! There'll be nothing left
of you. I can survive anything.
Back!
Whoa! Whoa! You can't
go back there, love.
No, no, no, it's too dangerous.
My friend's still in there.
Go back to the ambulance.
Walk as quick as you can, now.
Let me go and get him. Let me go!
Let me go! No!
Hold her down! Control
said no survivors.
Aaagh!
Sorry, I've got to take this.
Work? After what just happened?
Because of it. They're OK now.
Get yourselves to bed, girls.
And don't worry.
Hello.Target one's eliminated.
Two and three have escaped, but
we're in pursuit.What went wrong?
They got lucky. But they won't
get far.We can't have witnesses.
"Call me when you've got them.
"And make it quick!"
Off to bed.
I've got the translations.
Instructions.
Specifications for something
they want us to build.
And we haven't got
much time to do it in.
When they can communicate like
this, in this kind of detail,
why do the thing with the children?
Because they can.
And because they want to scare us.
Who do you work for?
Who do you work for?
The NHS.
Who do you work for?!
You tried to kill me. My friends could
be dead. So don't think I won't use this.
I'm working for the government. I just follow
orders, that's all. We're on the same side?
Aaaargh!
Why would the government want
to destroy Torchwood? Why?
I just do as I'm told. I'm just
following orders, that's all.
RADIO: "Please come in."
Jackson, keep the police back.
You, come with me.
If she's anti-terrorist, I would
not mind being Uncle Terrorist.
Get some back up. Two escaped suspects.
Ianto Jones, Gwen Cooper.
Armed and dangerous.
I know Gwen Cooper. She's an ex-police
officer, she's not a terrorist.
Haven't you got tape to tie?
Fine, I'm just saying. You're
barking up the wrong tree, that's all.
I want their homes raided.
Gwen Cooper is not a terrorist.
You must know where she lives.
Get up! Now! We've got
to go! Bloody hell, Gwen!
We've to get out of here. What's going on,
man?Listen, someone is trying to kill me.
And if they're after me, they're going to come
after you. Now get up, and get dressed!What?
Come on Rhys, faster, faster!
All right, all right.
Down to the bottom, take a left.
I mean, shouldn't there be
some sort of briefing first?
Like a risk assessment?
Not that Gwen's a risk.
Rhys, car keys? Try the
top of the fridge, I think.
I've tried on the top of the
bloody fridge, man! Come on!
If you put the keys in the same place all the time we
wouldn't have to go through this time and time again!
What are you doing?
Packing.
You're not going to have time to
read! And they can trace us with that!
Well, I've not gone into hiding before!
So, er, you lot are some sort of
specialists from London. Am I right?
I mean, I totally
respect that. Really I do.
But sometimes, there's no substitute
for a little bit of local knowledge.
And let me tell you, Gwen'll
be absolutely no bother.
We're not going in there
all guns blazing, are we?
How far is it?
Two minutes.
Come on, come on... Come on.
No! Rhys! Rhys!
Hello.Jesus Christ,
Rhys! It's Ianto, right?
Christ's sake, man!
Ianto, are you OK?
Yeah, have you heard from Jack?
No. No I haven't. Sorry, hang on.
Do you think he
survived? He usually does.
"Who was it?"I had a run-in with one of
them. Said he was working for the government.
That doesn't make sense. How did they get
close enough to plant it inside him, Ianto?
It was him, that Dr Rupesh. He was
shot and killed in the hospital earlier.
"It must've been then."
Let's go. Take the
bag. Get the car ready.
Er, where shall we meet, Ianto?
Your phone, your phone could be bugged.
Erm, right... Er...
Remember the last time
we had ice cream together?
No. Yeah, you do. After the Grand Slam.
I don't like ice cream.
It gives me a headache.
I've got to go.
Gwen!
Go!
Now do you believe she's a terrorist?
She shot the wheels.
What kind of terrorist
shoots your wheels?
A clever one.
Right. I think...we made it.
Let's go.Where?
Can't we just take a minute? Just to...
Number plate recognition. They can trace
us. We need to ditch it.It's a brand new car!
It's no good to us now,
OK? We need to keep moving.
Wouldn't it be better
if we gave ourselves up?
When I know what's happened, I'll tell
someone. Until then, we're going underground.
Let me carry the bag.
You want your trigger
finger free, don't you?
We're looking for Ianto Jones.
Don't move! Don't move!
We're looking for Ianto Jones. Well, you won't
find him in my bed, will you?! I'm a married man.
What?Keep your phones on today.
Why? I want to be able to speak to you.
Since when?Since we were
possessed by the Devil.I'm serious.
If they go off during a lesson,
we can't get them back till Friday.
Keep them on mute.
Every suspicious phone call, every time you come
home late, you hide behind the Official Secrets Act.
And I put up with it. Don't
start on this. Not now.
I accept it. But this is different. When it affects
my kids, in my house. There is nothing to worry about.
I saw how scared you were last night.
I know.
It's frightening to see it first
hand, there's no lasting damage.
It's quickly over. This
isn't a hula hoop craze.
It happened to Brian and Wendy's kids in Canada.
You don't think this is over any more than I do.
Just make sure they keep their phones on.
And don't let them come home on their own.
I'm off now, girls.
I'll see you.Goodbye
kisses, it must be serious.
If you could get out of bed at a
proper time, you'd get plenty of kisses.
Have a good day.
Dad?What?
We want a pony.
We want a pony.
We want a pony.See?
Nothing to worry about.
TV:"Latest headlines.
"Further reports are coming in about
the explosion in Cardiff last night.
"No organisation has yet claimed
responsibility for the explosion,
"which went off in the
Bay area of the city..."
Isn't that where Uncle Jack
lives? It's a big place. Shh!
"Casualty figures remain low,
with two people reported missing."
TV: "Residents in Cardiff are
reacting with shock and outrage.
"The entire bay area has been closed
off and witnesses say the effects
"of the explosion last night
could be felt five miles away.
"No-one can say for sure why this area
was the site of such an unexpected attack,
"and the Prime Minister's office has refused
to speculate until more details are known.
"Fortunately, the
timing of the device..."
As you know, Harkness is
a difficult man to kill.
Current theories suggest that his longevity
is connected in some way to the Torchwood Hub.
Which necessitated taking
out the entire operation.
He can't still be alive, after that.
As I said, awaiting results.
What about these, er...
these specifications?
From the 456? I could barely
understand a word of them.
Nor me. But I'm told the
translations are excellent.
And they've started work. Dekker's called in the damage
control team, they're working as fast as they can.
Early reports are
looking, well, promising.
Can we see it? They'll be ready to
show us work in progress by 1600 hours.
We're building something and
we don't even know what it is.
Can I ask?
Did the 456 contact any other country?
Intel's been listening.
No chatter on the wires.
Seems like it's only Britain.
And how long can we keep it secret?
Given the children's last
statement, "We are coming back".
That's what everyone
seems to be asking -
when were they here before?
Yes.
Well, if that's everything...Sir.
Sir, I'd just, um...
I just wanted to say how...
grateful I am, sir.What for?
Well.
I know that I'm something of a
middleman in these affairs, but um...
I just wanted to thank you,
for trusting me with the responsibility.
All I've done is put
you on the front line.
That's what the front line's for, John.
First to fall.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Come on, check the gas is turned off.
Get some breathing equipment down here.
Hang on! Stop! I've got something!
Hello? If you can hear
me, clench your hand.
It's not a body. It's just the arm.
ANSWER PHONE: "This is Jack Harkness.
Leave a message and I'll get back to you."
It's me. Call me.
When you get a chance.
Mum, there's no toothpaste.
Everything OK?Yeah. They're
expecting us, the car's waiting.
Well, come on then.
Hello?
We thought there was a body,
but we've got an arm, a shoulder and the remains
of a head. It's almost a waste of a body bag.
Is it Harkness?Presumably.
Take him to Ashton Down.
Keep him under surveillance.
Sorry, sir, I couldn't help hearing.
That name. Harkness.
Is that Captain Jack Harkness?
From Torchwood? Only he was
trying to contact you yesterday.
I did mark it in the
log. Said he could help.
Not now, he can't.Are you
sure? He was very insistent.
He told me his team were the experts at
dealing with things like the children thing.
He told you that? Over the phone? Yes.
He always was an arrogant sod.
So, he can't help?
He's not really the expert?
That bomb in Cardiff last night. He was the
one at the centre of it. It tore him to shreds.
Does that mean whoever's behind the bomb's behind the
children thing? Like they wanted him out of the way?
Lois, your job -
you don't overhear phone calls.
You speak when you're spoken to. OK?
Sorry.
Thanks, mate.
It'll be from Uncle Ianto.
Ssh! We're probably bugged.
Innocent kids, fast asleep at home,
and a gang of uniformed thugs break
in and point guns at their head?
It's no wonder they're traumatised. It's
no wonder our poor David pissed the bed.
I didn't.Ha, you big baby!
It's the police state to blame, and I'm going to
rinse the bastards for every penny they've got!
Oh, shut up, Johnny!
What's he done?
Why's he bringing it to our door?
Hey, hey.
We're the only family he's got.
Put it in here.
Come on, come on!
No. They've frozen mine, as well! Shit!
What now? How're we going to
manage without money, Gwen?
We need to get to London.London?
Everything's dearer in London! That's
where all the decisions are made.
Whoever wants us dead, that's where they'll
be.Right. So where we should be is John O'Groats!
I need to speak to people, but I
haven't got anybody's numbers any more.
So we've got to go there, OK?
These things are all linked.
Soon as you put your card in, bells
start ringing somewhere. Come on.
Any change?No.
Complete waste of time.
The body next door, Rupesh Patanjali,
London wants to know if it's
OK to release him to the family.
Zip it open.
It was a bag of bits when it came in.
And I asked you to keep an eye on it.
Get it out of that thing
and cuff it to the wall.
Hello.The good news is, we don't
have to wait for the DNA tests.
This is definitely Jack Harkness.
And what's the bad news?His Lazarus
qualities remain undiminished.
Jesus Christ!
"If he can survive that,
what can't he survive?"
I haven't got time to
worry about this, Johnson.
I've got more important
things in my in-tray.
What about Cooper and
Jones? No sign of him yet.
We've had a sighting
of her at a Cardiff ATM.
We need that whole team out of
the way by tonight. Get it done.
Wait out here.
Now me, I use an electronic seal, see.
Even the driver doesn't know the code. No-one
gets in until it reaches it's destination.
But this clown... Sure
he's going to London?
I don't question how you defend the world
against extra terrestrial infiltration.
Don't you question my knowledge
of the haulage industry.Sorry.
It's a small company, Gwen.
Cardiff to London. Piss poor security.
And best of all, guaranteed food cargo.
I'm absolutely bloody starving.
The smell from Tony's
is driving me crackers.
There is food. I can't
fault you on that.
I've got the smell of bacon in my nostrils,
and I'm looking at a lorry-load of raw spuds.
There might be other things at the back.
Come on.
Have you got your pen knife?
Rhys, you are not
eating uncooked potatoes!
We'll need it to cut our way out.
What kind of snoops
are you? Dibble or dole?
Dunno what you're talking
about. So you're perverts, then?
Is it you making them do all the weird talking shit?
Everyone look, a couple of paedos on the estate!
We have observations in place.
He'd have been better off staying dead.
Oh, God, this is uncomfortable.
Bloody torture, man!
How are you, love?
My best friend's belly had a
bomb go off in it last night.
Someone's been trying to kill us.
I'm travelling at 70mph on top of
potatoes, and I think I'm going to be sick.
Travel sick, is it?
When have you ever known
me to be travel sick?
Well, when have you
ever travelled like this?
On an empty stomach.
What?
You know some announcements, you...
rehearse in your head?
Yeah. And this wasn't...
quite what I had in mind.
What do you mean, announcements?
Oh, God, no!
Yes.Bloody hell, no!Yes.
Oh, come here. Oh, my God!
I don't believe it.
Hang on...
The bomb, the guns, the
car-chase, The hiding from the law.
What am I like? Letting you do all that
in your condition! You carried my bag.
I'm serious. This changes everything.
No, it doesn't. We're up the same
creek, and we still need a paddle.
Yeah, but three of us in the boat.
Hey.
Oh, my God! What happened to you?
I'm not sure yet.
I wasn't followed. Sit down.
You worked out my little code, then?
Dad didn't break your
leg on purpose, you know.
He pushed me too hard. He always did.
Well, you should've held on tighter.
Seriously. How did
you get in that state?
That bomb. It was meant for
me and the people I work with.
My God! Why?I don't know.
What sort of civil servants are you?
Unappreciated ones.
Are they OK?
The people you work with?
I don't know. Gwen's alive,
but I've just no way of contacting
her. I'm not sure about Jack.
Is he your boss?
The one Susan saw you with?
He'll be OK.
They won't get rid of him that easy.
I just need to find him.
If it's a boy,
Edward.
Edward?Yeah.
After the king.
Come on! Out of the way! Come on!
We are coming tomorrow.
We are coming tomorrow.
We are coming tomorrow.
OK, I'll tell him.
It's happened again.
Shit.
What did they say? "We
are coming tomorrow".
We are coming tomorrow. We are coming...
..Tomorrow. We are coming tomorrow...
We are coming tomorrow.
We are...This has something
to do with it. It must do.
When they tried to blow us up, this is what
we were working on. We are coming tomorrow.
Tomorrow?Over and over
again. Are you sure?
Positive.
Can you smell that?
They're coming!
I can smell them. They're coming!
Tomorrow, and they'll be here.
Hey, hey, hello. What did it feel like?
Leave her alone! Go away!
They said the same thing here.
Leave her alone. Piss off, you perv!
Yeah, OK, bye. It happened to David
and Mica. What is it? What is it?
I don't know. But this is what we do. We deal
with things like this. So deal with it. Stop it.
I need to find Jack. Give me that.
How will this help?I took the
number of the van they put him in.
You can track any vehicle with the right computer
programmes. Really?Yeah. Give me the car keys.
Oh, Johnny'll do his nut!
Please! We don't have time to spare.
A "thank you" would be nice!
Look, I'm sorry. I've got
to go. Thanks for all this.
Be careful!
Hold the line, please.Hello, I'll
put you on hold if that's all right.
Mr Frobisher will be back in a moment.
I'll have to put you on hold... Hello?
TV: "'We are coming tomorrow',
repeated in total 38 times."
Sorry, it's chaotic here at the
moment with the children thing...
"Reports confirm that every
single child said the same thing."
Give me the name and I'll look
into it, and get back to you.
Get my daughters on the phone. Ring
the school office if you haveto.
Then get me the Prime Minister.
There's a call waiting, sir.
Take a message! It's the Home Secretary.
And your wife wants you to call her. OK.
Hello. John Frobisher's office.
Can I speak to Mr Frobisher, please?
He's not available at the
moment. Can I take a message?
It's Gwen Cooper from Torchwood.
I need to see him urgently.
Can you set up a meeting?
Erm... I'm not sure. Just
put me straight through, then.
He's very busy.
Yeah, he would be! Who is
this? Lois. Lois Habiba.
What happened to Bridget Spears?
She's on another line."Do you
know what Torchwood is, Lois?"
Yes.Then you should know that right now
you lot need us. The whole world needs us.
But someone's trying to kill us. They
claim to be working for the government.
Why would the government want to kill people
who can help? That's why I need to see him!
Look, I know all this sounds mad, but you
have to believe me. I do. I do believe you.
Hold the line, please.Call my
wife. I'm in a meeting with the PM.
I'll ring as soon as I can. I'm
putting the school through.Ah!
If you're tracing this call...
I'm not.
So you can set up a meeting, then?
Lilly, is Holly there?
They're both all right?
Are you sure?Yes.
The Prime Minister's on his way.
He'll be there in ten minutes.
OK, thanks. Ring ahead, let
them know we're coming.Right.
Simon, we're going back to Thames House.
Can we trust this guy?
He's our man in the government. If we can't, we
really are in trouble. Gwen, we really are in trouble!
We've got to trust someone, Rhys, OK?
Hi. I'm Lois.
Where's Frobisher?
He's not coming.Why not?
Oh, God, this is probably
the worst mistake of my life.
I've read your files. Some of the stuff you've
done, you're like unsung national heroes.
Listen, I don't do autographs and I don't want to be
rude, but why am I talking to you and not your boss?
Because if he knew you
were here you'd be dead.
He gave the order to
have Jack Harkness killed.
Are you sure?
I've seen it with my own eyes.
We really are in trouble.
Do you know a Captain Andrew Staines?No.
A Colonel Michael Sanders?
Ellen Hunt?No.
They're all dead.
They were killed on the
same day as Jack Harkness.
I didn't sign the Official
Secrets Act to cover up murder.
But then, I didn't take the job
to commit treason on my second day.
What am I doing here? You tell me, Lois.
If you're the bad guys, why
doesn't it say that on your file?
And if you're the good guys, who am I
working for, and why do they want you dead?
Listen, this a lot to talk about.
And we're going to arouse suspicion.
And we haven't ordered.
When we went on the run,
we didn't have any money, see?
We put the last of the coins into
the phone boxto get through to you.
So If there's any
chance you could, er...
Thank you. Oh, great.
Thanks. That's magic.
I'll have steak pie and chips.
And a cup of tea. Just a latte for me.
OK, I won't be a sec.
I'll leave you to it.
Thanks, we owe you one. A big one.
Everyone in the office seems to think what's
happening with the kids is all to do with aliens.
And that they'll be here tomorrow.
And there's something big being built
on the top floor of the MI5 building.
OK, what do you mean
something? I don't know.
But it's like they're getting ready.
And if you lot... Torchwood...
if you're the alien experts, and
they really are coming tomorrow,
why does Mr Frobisher want you
out of the way all of a sudden?
I've no idea. But I'm going to find out.
Can you tell me anything about
Jack Harkness? Or Ianto Jones?
Jones is missing.
I've been told Captain Harkness
is dead.Well, that can't be true.
Well, that's what I thought.
I overheard Mr Frobisher say to keep him under
surveillance. Why do that to a dead person?
Come on! Who's the
genius behind the camera?
Come on, come on out and take your bow!
Show yourself! Face me like a man!
I'm not a man.
Who are you?
What's all this about?
Apparently you can't die,
so it would be foolish
to tell you anything.
But I will say this.
If I can't kill you...
..I can contain you.
GWEN: Do you know where
they're keeping him?
I've got a floor plan in my bag.
Steak pie and chips, twice?
Oh, lovely, thank you.
It's, um...
it's a military compound.
Are you sure?
That's where Mr Frobisher told them to take
him. Salt? Thanks. This is brilliant work, Lois.
Can you? Oh, thanks.The only
problem is, how do we get inside?
Well, Mr Frobisher's just authorised
the release of a body from Ashton Down.
This is Rupesh Patanjali.
They must have thought he was one of us.
The undertaker's name
is Richard Rossiter
and he's got an appointment
to pick him up at 5.30 today.
I was thinking, access to a funeral director would be
easier than access to a secure military compound. So...
He'd have to pass through
here at some time between
5 and 5.15 to get to Ashton Down for
5.30, and there'd be no witnesses.
The name of the contact at the
compound is a Corporal Camara.
His number's on there, and
he'll be expecting you. Sugar?
I'm a PA. It's what I do.
When this is all over, and you
want a job, come and see me.
I'm sorry.
I don't suppose you'll believe it.
But this is all in
the national interest.
Prime Minister.Ready?
Let's go.
Have they sent us any
further information?
Not since they sent us
the designs for this thing.
I've got two radio operators
working round the clock.
We're sending out continuous
messages on the 456 wavelength,
but we're getting nothing
back. Don't mind me.
What's the latest from Jodrell Bank? Any signs of
their approach? No. But then there wasn't last time.
What's that for?
It's for them.
Hi, we're here to pick up a body.
5.30 appointment. Corporal Camara?
Kodak's dead!? When did that happen?
No, he's the contact.
The name of the deceased is
Patanjali. Rupesh Patanjali.
Jesus!
Shit meself then!
He owes me money.Sorry. I'll
have to look in the back.
Kodak, got a couple of body-snatchers
down at the gate for you, over.
OK, let 'em in. Over.
We're not going to get away with this.
You really shouldn't be here,
Rhys. I shouldn't?! Hello?!
If Jack needs carrying,
you're going to need me here.
See that fire exit? Do
you wanna back up to that?
Save you having to wheel
him round the block.OK.
So there's an upside to this place
being turned into a
mortuary all of a sudden.
So you don't get many bodies, then?
Not usually.
But we've got in three at the moment.
Do I know you?No, I don't think so.
You don't look like an undertaker.
If more undertaker's looked like you,
there'd be more of a demand for bereavement.
Ooh, ooh, hang on. I'm just going
to open the fire door for your mate.
Corporal Camara at the west corridor. I'm just
opening the fire door for the body-snatchers. OK?
OK.
She's shy, isn't she?
I just prefer the
company of dead people.
Is she seeing anyone? She's married. Married
and pregnant, so you can forget it, mate, right?
You're a couple, aren't you?
No offence. You can't
blame a man for trying.
Do you want to check this
is the right one?Yeah.
Corporal Camara?
Yeah.
Everything OK? The camera's not working.
Yeah. Just checking the
paperwork. No problem.
What's going? I've lost two cameras now.
That's the one. Come on.
ALARM
Intruders. Two of, west corridor.
Intruders, two of, west corridor.
Shit. Leave it, Rhys. Out the way!
What the hell is that?
Move! Move! Move! Positions.
We'll have to surrender.
I'd lay down your
weapons, if I were you.
You're as trapped and helpless
as the man in the concrete cell.
Put the guns down!
OK.
Run!Positions. Come on!
Positions. Come on, get on.
Ah, Ianto. You took your time. Come on.
Come on!
Move it!Take your positions.
They're going to catch up. Rhys,
get out and move that truck.
Hold on tight.
Move, Rhys!
Come on.
We've got a problem.
Cooper and Jones stalled
us at a roadblock.
How did that happen?I'm sorry. There's a chopper
on the way, but they've got a head start on us.
If he talks, we're in deep, deep
shit. I'll have to call you back.
Where the hell are you taking us, Ianto?
What are we doing?
You'll see. Get the car started!
We've only got a few minutes. Come on!
(Come on, come on, come on.)
Told you I'd be back.
With a little help from us.
What the hell is going on?Dunno yet, but the latest
from the kids is that it's happening tomorrow.
I'm just in time, then. Get in the car.
Come on, we've got work to do.
TV:"..United Nations has issued a statement
asking parents and guardians of children..."
TV: "..still remains why every child in the
world is giving their statements in English..."
TV:"..no theories as to why and how..."
TV:"The focus now is on tomorrow.
"With every child in the world claiming that
tomorrow is the day, the world is left wondering."
Mr Frobisher, sir.
Seals locked and...
..release.
As per the 456 instructions.
A combination of 25% nitrosyl chloride,
22% hydrogen chloride,
20% nitrogen, 12% fluorine,
9% hydrogen cyanide,
6% acetone, 6% phosgene.
In short...
poison.
I'd hold on to your nose, Bridget!
Though, come to think of it, you've been doing
that for years. And that's what they breathe?
Breathe? Eat? Fart?
We know nothing about them! Excuse me,
if we know the composition of that gas, can't we
work out what sort of creature could live inside it?
Could do. If we had all
the time in the world!
So they arrive...
and then what?
The whole room's laid out,
according to 456 instructions.
Something of an
ambassadorial suite, I'd say.
Or a throne room.
Who knows,
maybe a slaughterhouse.
But if they arrive tomorrow, then how?
How do they arrive inside that?
No idea.
Who else knows about
this? For all we know,
they've sent the same instructions
to every country in the world.
We've said nothing, maybe everyone
else is keeping quiet, too.
Oh, I don't think so. Whoever they
are, they're coming for Britain.
Well, why?
Exactly.
Why is that, Mr Frobisher?
John Frobisher's a good man.
And better than that, he's expendable.
If anybody finds out what
I'm doing... It's treason!
You're the only friend we've got left,
Lois. We are coming. We are coming.
It's them, it's all of them
- the kids.We are here.

Je ne veux pas vous effrayer.

Nous voilà.
{\pos(192,230)}C'est Torchwood.
{\pos(192,230)}Nous sommes chez nous.
<i>Les enfants parlaient de
demain, et demain est arrivé.</i>
<i>Nos correspondants ont
évalué la situation...</i>
<i>Le Sénat fait remarquer que l'on vit
maintenant effrayés par nos enfants.</i>
<i>Effrayés par ce qu'ils
diront la prochaine fois.</i>
<i>Effrayés par ce qui parle à travers eux.</i>
J'ai presque perdu mes sourcils !
Mais je sers à quelque chose,
tu vois ? Merci les scouts.
- Je suis gelée.
- Personne ne va nous trouver ici ?
- Avec ce feu ?
- C'est abandonné depuis les années 90.
Ca appartenait à
Torchwood. Torchwood Un.
- C'est déserté depuis des années.
- Alors que fait-on ?
On reste assis là ?
Plus important, je dois vraiment garder
ces habits ? Sérieusement !
Un pantalon de jogging ?
C'est pas la classe.
Jack, ils arrivent aujourd'hui.
Cette voix extraterrestre
{\pos(192,190)}a dit aujourd'hui, et on est
coincé au milieu de nulle part.
Mais on est ensemble. La vieille équipe.
On est diminué, mais toujours là.
On a survécu à pire.
En plus, tu ne devrais pas
trop te battre, dans ton état.
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
- Bon sang, Jack !
- Il sait que tu es enceinte ?
Tu lui as dit avant moi ?
Il était là sur le moment,
c'est arrivé très vite.
{\pos(192,210)}Le dernier au courant,
bon sang, le dernier !
{\pos(192,210)}Ne sois pas bête ! Ne fais pas...
Tu pouvais pas la fermer ?
Tous ensemble.
La vieille équipe.
<i>La tension augmente tandis
que la planète entière</i>
<i>attend le prochain incident.</i>
<i>Nous n'avons eu aucune réponse,</i>
<i>aucun espoir, aucune garantie</i>
<i>que nos enfants passeront en premier...</i>
<i>Le gouvernement refuse de
spéculer quant à l'origine</i>
<i>de la voix ou de
l'importance du mot "demain".</i>
<i>Nous nous rendons maintenant
en direct, à Downing Street.</i>
À la lumière de ce qui
arrive à nos enfants,
les écoles ont été
temporairement fermées.
En outre, un couvre-feu
temporaire a été instauré
pour toute personne
de moins de 18 ans.
<i>Gardez vos enfants
chez vous, en sécurité.</i>
<i>Le couvre-feu prend effet immédiatement</i>
et continuera jusqu'à
nouvel ordre.
<i>Mais soyez tranquilles.</i>
<i>Nous faisons tout ce qui est en notre
pouvoir pour comprendre,</i>
<i>pour préserver nos enfants et
toute la population de notre nation.</i>
<i>En attendant, nous vous
prions de rester calmes,</i>
<i>et de continuer à vivre normalement.</i>
<i>Rien ne prouve que
nous sommes en danger,</i>
<i>et dès que nous en saurons plus,</i>
<i>la population en sera informée.</i>
<i>Et comme toujours,
je vous remercie de votre confiance</i>
<i>et de votre foi.</i>
C'est moi, écoute,
je ne peux pas parler,
mais lève le pouce, elle
saura ce que ça signifie.
Super ! Merci, Mac !
Mac lève le pouce, Ianto est vivant !
C'est tout ? Imbécile, dis-moi
où il est, ce qu'il fait !
Le pouce levé, c'est tout.
Voilà Eliza,
elle fait une intolérance au
lactose, alors pas de lait.
Bien. Enlève ton manteau,
va là-bas et joue, d'accord ?
C'est tout, Johnny.
Plus d'autres enfants !
Je n'en peux plus !
C'est du service public ! Les écoles
sont fermées, les gens travaillent !
- La vie continue !
- Et tu en tires profit.
£10 par môme. Ça pourrait être
notre slogan, £10 par môme !
<i>Ici Jack Harkness, laissez un
message et je vous rappellerai.</i>
Alors, on a... Des flingues,
et un couteau suisse.
Un PC portable, à plat.
Des cartes de crédit et un
téléphone, qui peuvent être tracés.
De l'aspirine, des timbres,
des lentilles de contact, et £15.
Plus 25 pens.
Avec un mauvais coup alien
qui s'annonce.
On a toujours une partie
des logiciels.
On a perdu le QG, mais les logiciels
sont toujours sur le serveur.
Par contre, il va nous falloir plus
d'équipement, et surtout l'électricité.
Et comment allons-nous faire,
planqués comme des criminels ?
C'est ça. Super !
- Quoi ?
- Des criminels. Des voleurs.
Nous.
Ils nous traitent comme
des criminels, soyons-en !
J'ai été entraînée dans la police,
je sais tout ce qu'il faut
savoir ! J'ai tout vu !
Allez, les mecs. Vous
allez apprendre des choses.
Tout va bien ?
- Oui, merci beaucoup.
- Ça fera £15, s'il vous plaît.
Revenez, c'est ma voiture !
Je fais juste un tour dehors. Je
reviens tout de suite, d'accord ?
Excusez-moi, je peux
emprunter votre téléphone ?
Je veux juste appeler ma sœur,
elle est inquiète pour les enfants.
Mon portable ne marche plus.
Ça ne vous dérange pas ?
- Bien sûr.
- Je fais vite. Merci beaucoup.
<i>Bonjour, poste de police de Cardiff Bay.</i>
<i>J'essaie de contacter le Capitaine
Harkness, il travaille pour Torchwood.</i>
Je sais que ce n'est pas
votre service, mais...
Je pense qu'il était
dans cette explosion,
je n'arrive pas à le contacter.
Il a un numéro privé...
<i>Il me faut vos nom et adresse.</i>
Je veux juste savoir où il est.
<i>Il me faut vos nom et adresse.</i>
<i>Nom et adresse, s'il vous plaît.</i>
Merci beaucoup.
Elle s'appelle Alice
Carter, née Alice Sangster.
Fille de James et Mary Sangster.
C'est important, car ils
n'ont jamais vraiment existé.
Ce sont des faux noms,
utilisés au début des années 70
pour le personnel sous couverture
ou sous protection des témoins.
En d'autres mots, son
identité est fausse.
- Pouvez-vous découvrir qui elle est ?
- Je m'en occupe.
Que la lumière soit !
- De vrais criminels !
- Ça en jette, non ?
Tu fais maintenant
officiellement partie de l'équipe.
Va te faire voir, mon pote.
Occupe-toi de ces ordinateurs,
et ramène-moi à la maison.
Je vois qu'on a une nouvelle voiture.
Bien, très élégant.
On a cru que tu t'étais fait arrêter !
J'achetais les produits de base.
La technologie est une chose.
Mais il ne faut pas oublier le confort.
Du café, bien sûr.
- Du PQ...
- Dieu merci !
Et le plus important...
Je ne connaissais pas vos tailles,
mais je crois que j'ai un bon œil.
Super ! Je pue.
- Pas mal !
- Et pour monsieur...
- Les surplus de l'armée.
- C'est pas vrai !
Je suis de retour !
Ça fait si longtemps. Mais
tout revient, n'est-ce pas ?
A cause de cette odeur...
De plus en plus près.
C'est pour aujourd'hui, oui, c'est
toujours aujourd'hui, n'est-ce pas ?
C'est comme hier.
Aujourd'hui et hier.
Je savais qu'ils reviendraient.
Ces bâtards reviennent toujours.
Je peux les sentir.
Exactement comme la
dernière fois, n'est-ce pas ?
Arrêtez. Arrêtez.
Arrêtez !
C'est lui...
- Ne m'emmenez pas, ils m'attraperont !
- Ne bougez pas.
- Ne m'emmenez pas, allez-vous en !
- C'est ça.
Allez... Vous aggravez les choses.
Arrêtez !
Ils m'attraperont, ils m'attraperont !
- Et on est connecté !
- Comme au bon vieux temps.
Je me connecte aux nouvelles
chaînes, voir ce qui se passe.
- Noir, sans sucre ?
- C'est ça.
Aucun signe. Le ciel est vide.
Bien, que cherchons-nous ?
Fais une recherche
sur Clement MacDonald.
Vois s'il y a du nouveau.
Et les noms que Lois nous a donnés,
Capitaine Andrew Staines.
Ellen Hunt, c'est ça ?
Michael quelque chose. Tous
assassinés le jour de l'explosion.
Andrew Staines, Ellen Hunt, Michael
Sanders, ça te dit quelque chose ?
Rien du tout.
Il faut qu'on arrive
à pénétrer Whitehall.
- Tu as le logiciel I5, Ianto ?
- Il est toujours en ligne, pourquoi ?
Télécharge-le sur l'ordinateur, car
ce ne sont pas de simples lentilles.
Ce sont des lentilles
de contact Torchwood.
Mais à quoi vont-elles nous servir ?
Il n'y a plus qu'une personne
qui nous parle encore.
Y a-t-il une Lois ici ? Lois Habiba ?
- C'est moi.
- C'est pas un centre d'appel, vite.
<i>Lois, regardez à votre droite.</i>
<i>Ne raccrochez pas.
5 minutes, juste 5 minutes.</i>
Je vous ai déjà aidés
une fois. Ça suffit.
Si on découvre ce que je
fais... C'est de la trahison.
Littéralement, de la trahison.
Je pourrais finir devant un juge.
Ils pourraient me faire n'importe quoi.
Vous dites qu'ils construisent
quelque chose. On doit savoir quoi.
C'est le bâtiment le
plus protégé du pays.
- Je ne peux pas vous faire entrer !
- Ça ne sera pas la peine.
Gardez les yeux ouverts. Comme ça.
Mais...
D'où ça vient ?
C'est pas une webcam, c'est vous.
Et à droite.
Et à gauche.
Et on revient.
Où est la caméra ? Sur votre veste ?
Sur mes yeux.
Mon Dieu.
En les portant, une image de ce
qui se passe nous sera transmise.
Et encore mieux, on a un
logiciel pour lire sur les lèvres.
Regardez quelqu'un parler,
et il nous traduira ces paroles.
Appuyez sur entrée. Allez-y.
Maintenant ça marche.
Dites quelque chose.
<i>- Comme quoi ?
- Comme quoi ?</i>
<i>- Mon Dieu, c'est curieux.
- Mon Dieu, c'est curieux.</i>
Et on peut vous envoyer des messages.
Tapez quelque chose.
Allez-y, n'importe quoi.
- Bonjour Lois.
- Vous pouvez voir ça ? Sur vos yeux ?
C'est génial, n'est-ce pas ?
Si vous les portez, on pourra
comprendre ce qu'il se passe.
- Et faire quelque chose.
- Je ne peux pas. Et s'ils
détectent les mouchards ?
- Ils ne les trouveront pas. Promis.
- Je ne peux pas.
Vous donner des infos est une chose.
- Là, je serais en première ligne.
- Vous êtes notre seule alliée.
Même si je rentre dans
la Maison de la Tamise,
je ne peux pas aller à l'étage 13,
où ils construisent cette chose.
Frobisher n'y emmène que
Mlle Spears, je ne suis que...
- Vous devrez trouver un moyen.
- Comment ?
Je ne sais pas,
- vous trouverez quelque chose.
- Je ne peux pas !
Désolée, je dois y aller.
Prenez-les, je vous en supplie.
- Je dois vraiment y aller.
- S'il vous plaît, Lois.
Je ne peux pas.
S'il vous plaît.
Frobisher est la clé de tout ça.
C'est juste un fonctionnaire,
il n'est rien.
Alors pourquoi autorise-t-il
des exécutions ?
Comment c'était ?
Je veux dire, l'explosion.
C'était pas une partie de plaisir.
Mais... Tu l'as sentie ?
Ou c'est juste devenu tout noir ?
Je l'ai sentie.
Merde.
Tu penses qu'un jour,
ta chance s'épuisera ?
Que tu ne reviendras pas.
Je suis un point fixe
dans le temps et l'espace.
C'est ce que dit le Docteur.
Je pense que ça veut dire pour toujours.
Alors... Un jour, tu me verras mourir
de vieillesse.
Et tu continueras.
Il va falloir en profiter, alors.
Je suppose.
Maintenant ?
Ianto, c'est peut-être la fin du monde.
C'est toujours la fin du monde.
Et ce manteau m'a manqué.
Tu veux bien prendre la
voiture et aller au magasin ?
Il nous faut des disques pour ces trucs.
- Ça devrait prendre environ... 20min ?
- 30min.
J'irai plus tard, les
haricots sont bientôt cuits !
Les haricots sont bientôt cuits.
Foutus haricots.
C'est génial, regarde-ça...
Programme de reconnaissance faciale.
Et...
Arrêté il y a 2 heures à Londres.
Il ne veut pas donner son nom,
mais c'est Clement MacDonald.
- C'est celui de l'hôpital.
- Ça pourrait être utile.
Je lui ai donné les lentilles,
mais je pense qu'elle a trop peur.
<i>On a une nouvelle mission pour toi.</i>
On a retrouvé Clem, à la
station de police de Candem,
<i>arrêté pour vol et trouble mineur.</i>
- Tu peux le faire sortir ?
- Et comment je fais ça ?
Tu es un agent de police.
Bon sang, et autre chose
pendant que j'y suis ?
- Un bon steak, ça serait bien.
- N'exagère pas, à plus tard.
Alors, Ianto,
qu'est-ce qui lui est arrivé ?
Selon Gwen, il a été enlevé
par des aliens étant petit, classique.
En 1965.
Il vivait à 15km d'Arbroath,
au Holly Tree Lodge,
c'était un orphelinat.
J'ai cherché le dossier,
les enfants ont été enlevés en
novembre 1965. Le Lodge fermait
et il fallait les emmener
dans un autre orphelinat,
le Harbour Heights à Plymouth.
Sauf que
c'est là que le dossier s'arrête,
aucune trace de leur arrivée.
C'était les années 60,
plein de papiers disparaissaient.
Mais s'il dit vrai, ils ne sont
peut-être jamais arrivés.
- Montre-moi ces gens.
- Qui ça ?
Andrew Staines, Ellen Hunt,
Michael Sanders.
- Tu penses qu'il y a un lien ?
- Montre-les moi !
Donne-moi leur historique,
montre-les moi il y a 40 ans.
- Pourquoi ?
- Mais fais-le !
Qui c'est, Jack ?
Tu les connaissais ?
- Je ne connaissais pas leurs noms.
- Qui c'était ?
Dis-le-moi.
Tu les connaissais ?
Les haricots sont prêts !
Alice Carter. J'ai cracké le dossier,
vous allez adorer.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Des signes de Harkness ?
Les démons du passé. Vous saviez
qu'il avait une fille ?
Depuis quand ?
Elle est sous couverture depuis 1977
à la demande de sa mère.
Elle cherchait à éviter
le Capitaine Jack.
On peut la comprendre.
<i>- Qui était la mère ?
- Une certaine Lucia Moretti.</i>
Une italienne qui a travaillé
pour Torchwood de 1968 à 1977.
Elle est morte d'un problème de cœur
en 2006.
Une cause naturelle,
c'est rare chez Torchwood.
<i>Et Alice Carter a un fils.
Le petit-fils de Jack.</i>
<i>- Ça pourrait nous aider. Que fait-on ?
- Amenez-les.</i>
C'est la réponse que j'attendais.
Pas de nouvelles de Jodrell Bank,
mais nous devrions nous préparer.
Bridget, prenez tout ce qu'il vous faut,
nous partons à la Maison de la Tamise.
Que dois-je faire ?
Exactement ce que vous faites :
répondre au téléphone.
Je pourrais venir avec vous,
je vous aiderais.
Je ne pense pas.
Mais M. Frobisher m'a demandé
de venir.
- Quand ça ?
- Il a dit qu'il me voulait.
- À ses côtés.
- Pourquoi ?
- Pourquoi aurait-il besoin de vous ?
- C'était
une conversation privée.
Vous n'êtes pas la première,
vous savez.
Ne croyez pas être la première.
- Je peux venir, alors ?
- Apparemment.
<i>Andy, écoute.</i>
<i>- Tu es vivante ?
- Je suis vivante.</i>
- Tais-toi, j'ai besoin d'aide.
- On a besoin de toi !
Tous ces gamins qui répètent
"nous allons venir",
<i>et c'est pour aujourd'hui !
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?</i>
<i>Un vaisseau spatial ?
Godzilla ?</i>
Écoute, j'ai besoin que tu libères
quelqu'un du poste de Camden.
<i>- C'est à Albany Street.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais à Camden ?</i>
<i>- C'est important ?
- Pour moi, oui.</i>
Je sais, désolée. J'ai pas mes papiers,
il faudrait que
tu te portes garant. Les charges ne sont
pas lourdes, je peux le faire sortir
<i>si tu les appelles
et leur faxes un WC242A.</i>
N'utilise pas mon nom,
dis-leur que je m'appelle Lynda.
<i>Tu peux faire ça pour moi ?
Maintenant ?</i>
Vous vous souvenez de moi, Clem ?
Tout va bien.
Je suis là.
C'est nul, je veux voir des aliens !
Attention à ce que tu demandes.
Mets des dessins animés.
Viens, on y va, vite.
- La télé dit qu'il faut rester là.
- C'est moi qui décide.
On va sortir et tu vas te taire,
d'accord ?
Pas un bruit.
C'est comme ces jeux que mamie
t'a appris, tu te souviens ?
Elle disait toujours que
j'aurais des problèmes.
Alors fais ce qu'elle disait,
pas un bruit.
Et ne me perds pas de vue.
Viens.
Personne ! Personne !
- Écartez-vous de mon chemin.
- Allez-y, tirez.
Voyons ce qu'il va se passer.
Vous êtes aussi immortelle que
votre père ? Et le petit ?
On peut essayer.
Prenez-moi, laissez-le.
- Ce n'est qu'un enfant.
- Et ?
Si nous voulions votre mort,
nous aurions déjà tiré.
Posez votre arme.
- Qui êtes-vous ?
- Posez votre arme.
Si vous lui faites du mal,
je vous tue.
Compris.
Et le couteau.
Vous êtes bien la fille
de votre père.
Viens, chéri.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a,
qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il montre ?
Arrête.
Arrête, s'il te plaît !
Regarde-moi !
Arrête !
Ce sont eux.
Si je nettoie, c'est £2 de plus,
dis-le à ta mère !
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Arrêtez.
Vous m'entendez ?
Lilly, c'est maman !
Regarde-moi !
Regarde-moi !
Qu'y a-t-il ?
Ce sont eux, tous ensemble.
Les enfants.
Qu'est-ce qu'ils disent ?
Je ne sais pas, ils montrent
quelque chose.
<i>Encore une fois, tous les enfants
se sont arrêtés.</i>
<i>Tous les enfants du monde.</i>
<i>{\pos(192,220)}Apparemment,
ils ne parlent pas.</i>
<i>{\pos(192,220)}Ils semblent montrer
quelque chose dans le ciel.</i>
C'est aux infos,
ils montrent quelque chose.
Je sais,
mais c'est dans cette direction.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a, là-bas ?
Tous les enfants d'Amérique
désignent l'est.
Tous les enfants d'Europe
désignent l'ouest.
C'est nous.
Ils nous montrent.
Si on va assez loin par là,
c'est Londres.
Ils désignent Londres.
<i>D'après les rapports,</i>
<i>les enfants de Londres désignent tous
le centre de la ville.</i>
<i>{\pos(192,220)}Je répète, les enfants
de Londres désignent</i>
<i>le centre.</i>
C'est la Maison de la Tamise !
Venez !
Ça commence !
Désolé, vous restez ici.
Nous sommes là.
Ce sont eux.
Ils sont de retour.
Vous êtes lié à eux,
il faut qu'on découvre comment.
<i>Parlez.</i>
Je m'appelle John Frobisher,
Secrétaire d'État
du Royaume-Uni
et de l'Irlande du Nord.
Terre.
Au nom de la race humaine...
Quelque chose ne va pas ?
Voulez-vous que je continue ?
Alors...
Si je puis me permettre...
Pour favoriser la communication...
Nous ne connaissons pas le nom
de votre espèce. Quel est-il ?
<i>Vous nous appelez les 456.</i>
C'est exact.
<i>Alors ceci est notre nom.</i>
Si je puis me permettre,
au nom de mon gouvernement,
que voulez-vous ?
Vous m'entendez ?
Je suis désolé, mais je dois le savoir
avant de parler à mes supérieurs,
que voulez-vous ?
Je dois vous demander, officiellement,
le motif de votre visite.
<i>Parler.</i>
Mais je parle !
<i>Nous voulons parler.</i>
À qui ?
<i>Au monde.</i>
Pourquoi ?
<i>Nous voulons parler.</i>
Peut-être que nous ne voyons pas
les choses de la même façon,
mais pour nous, ce serait
une liaison diplomatique.
Cela vous paraît-il correct ?
En un sens, nous sommes
tous les deux ambassadeurs.
Selon le protocole, les conversations
diplomatiques ne sont pas publiques.
Vous ne parleriez pas
à toute la population,
mais aux représentants
qu'ils ont élus.
C'est comme ça que ça marche.
C'est tout ce que j'ai à vous offrir.
Est-ce acceptable ?
Oui.
Bien.
Merci.
Amenez-les.
Merci.
J'ai une
condition.
Est-ce que vous comprenez ?
Une condition ?
Les 456 ont pris contact
avec ce pays par le passé.
Il y a longtemps.
Il serait mieux que...
Je veux dire, au vu de la nature
de cette rencontre,
il serait bon pour assurer
la relation diplomatique
entre la Terre et les 456
si cette première prise de contact
restait secrète.
Je veux dire, privée.
Entre nous.
Est-ce que vous pouvez faire ça ?
<i>Oui.</i>
Merci.
<i>Vite.</i>
Pardon ?
<i>Revenez.</i>
<i>Vite.</i>
Je le ferai.
Merci.
<i>Le périmètre autour de
la Maison de la Tamise</i>
<i>a été bouclé
alors que le Gouvernement...</i>
C'est parti.
<i>{\pos(192,190)}- Pile quand on a besoin de Jack.
- ... à Downing Street.</i>
<i>{\pos(192,190)}Ces images ont été filmées
il y a 5 minutes.</i>
<i>{\pos(192,190)}Cet homme est le Colonel Oduya</i>
<i>{\pos(192,190)}de UNIT.</i>
<i>{\pos(192,190)}Et cet homme
qui arrive est le Général Austin Pierce,</i>
<i>{\pos(192,190)}le représentant
des Forces Armées Américaines.</i>
<i>{\pos(192,190)}Il entre à Downing Street
à ce moment même.</i>
Le Président des États-Unis
m'a chargé de vous transmettre
sa fureur absolue.
- Vous avez compris ?
- Tout à fait.
Cet atterrissage n'était pas spontané,
il avait été prévu.
Il avait été préparé
par vous.
Et n'appelez pas ça de la diplomatie,
M. Green.
Vous avez mené votre cour,
la cour souveraine de Grande-Bretagne,
en complète opposition
avec les Nations Unies.
- Nous avions reçu des ordres.
- Vous menaçaient-ils ?
Je pense qu'on peut dire que
l'existence même des 456 est une menace.
Néanmoins,
vous avez un ambassadeur alien
sur le sol britannique.
La Grande Bretagne n'a pas déclaré
de droits de territoire
ou de souveraineté
du vaisseau 456.
Mais il est là !
Vous ne pouvez pas le nier !
Vous avez exclu UNIT de toutes
les étapes de cette négociation,
alors que nous sommes entraînés
pour ces situations.
J'en suis désolé.
Le Président est invité
à monter à l'étage 13, bien entendu,
comme tous les dirigeants
du monde libre.
- J'en serais honoré.
- Mais c'est impossible,
et vous le savez.
Nous n'amènerons pas le Président dans
un lieu qui n'a pas été sécurisé,
et il faudrait des jours pour faire ça.
Des semaines !
Je vous propose de vous retirer,
alors.
Qu'est-ce que ça signifie ?
Je ne me jouerai pas des Nations Unies,
ni d'aucune nation.
Je suggère que le dialogue avec les 456
passe entre d'autres mains
et soit mené par un fonctionnaire.
Il sera quand même anglais.
Mais pas élu, sans autorité d'État.
C'est exactement ce dont
nous avons besoin.
Un intermédiaire.
John Frobisher a déjà parlé avec eux,
je suggère qu'il continue.
Moi, je suggère que UNIT intervienne.
J'aimerais que ce soit possible, mais
les 456 ont choisi la Grande-Bretagne.
Ils ont choisi le lieu.
Ce n'est pas de mon ressort.
Vous voulez les mettre en colère ?
Écoutez...
John Frobisher est quelqu'un de bien.
Et encore mieux,
il peut faire fusible.
Qu'en pensez-vous ?
Avons-nous votre parole que
- vous n'entrerez pas dans cette pièce ?
- Vous l'avez.
Alors c'est d'accord.
D'accord.
<i>- John ?
- Monsieur le Premier Ministre ?</i>
<i>Après un entretien avec les forces
militaires, nous avons décidé que</i>
<i>vous deviendriez notre porte-parole
dans les négociations avec les 456.</i>
<i>Simon va vous briefer.
Merci.</i>
Merde.
Je serai la dernière à savoir.
C'est mon mari mais il ne
m'explique rien.
Les filles montrent le ciel
du doigt et il ne dit rien !
Non, il n'y a rien, j'ai zappé
sur les chaînes d'infos,
ils ne disent rien...
Oui, je sais.
Si j'ai du nouveau
je t'appelle.
OK. Bye.
Lilly ! Descends, s'il-te-plait,
je veux te voir tout le temps.
<i>Ce qu'on appelle "la colonne
de feu" paralyse le centre de Londres.</i>
<i>{\pos(192,200)}Toutes les rues vers
le fleuve sont bloquées,</i>
<i>{\pos(192,200)}ce qui provoque des
bouchons sur les grandes artères.</i>
<i>{\pos(192,200)}Les voitures doivent

<i>{\pos(192,200)}sauf urgences.</i>
C'est bien Jack, ça !
Il fallait le retenir !
Je sais pas, on va mettre
des heures, c'est bouché.
Foutue Londres !
La moitié des gens panique
et veut partir,
l'autre essaie de rentrer.
Bon, faut que je file.
Bye.
Tout va bien, Clem.
Vous êtes en sécurité avec moi.
Vous êtes en sécurité. Avec moi.
- Tout va bien.
- Les souvenirs reviennent.
Il n'y a pas qu'eux, là-haut.
C'est l'homme.
Il est revenu.
Après toutes ces années.
- Je le sens.
- Quel homme ?
Qui ?
Le même homme.
Je savais qu'il reviendrait
pour moi.
Très bien. Allons donc
prendre un bon thé.
Et un hot dog. Vous aimez ça ?
J'adore ça.
<i>Je recommande de commencer à 19h.</i>
Ça nous laisse deux heures.
Voici Louise, conseiller
en protocoles diplomatiques
internationaux, ainsi que Samuel...
Il y a une créature là-haut.
Puissante, toxique,
capable de Dieu sait quoi.
Vous êtes bien contente de trotter
derrière John Frobisher à présent.
<i>Stuart est expert en langues,</i>
il peut aider s'il y a un
problème de traduction.
Pardon, je dois prendre cet appel.
J'allais t'appeler. Comme
j'aimerais être à la maison !
Dis aux filles qu'il ne faut
pas s'inquiéter.
Je leur dirai, Johnny boy.
Je leur dirai que leur papa a
essayé de me faire tuer, hein ?
C'est le portable de ma femme,
comment l'avez-vous eu ?
C'est 1965, hein ?
Tout ça à cause de 1965.
Frobisher, dites-moi, c'est eux ?
Ils sont revenus ?
Oui.
C'est pour ça que vous avez
essayé de me faire tuer.
Ainsi que Andrew Staines,
Ellen Hunt et Michael Sanders.
Nous tous morts, plus personne
ne pourra parler, hein ?
Je n'avais pas le choix.
Moi j'en ai un...
<i>Vous voulez l'entendre ?</i>
Je peux faire péter tout ça.
Le dire au monde entier !
<i>Sauf si j'entre dans
la Maison de la Tamise.</i>
J'exige de parler aux
456 moi-même.
<i>Pensez-y.</i>
Leur retour prouve qu'on ne peut
pas leur faire confiance.
Vous avez besoin de moi.
Capitaine, nous avons votre fille
et votre petit-fils,
<i>Alice et Steven Carter
avec nous.</i>
Quoi ?!
Je vous promets formellement
que rien ne leur arrivera.
Tant que vous ne dites rien.
Et si je retourne chez vous et que
je prends votre femme ?
<i>Et vos enfants ?</i>
Vous ne le ferez pas,
car vous valez mieux que moi.
Pardon, Jack.
<i>Le monde entier
attend des nouvelles</i>
<i>de la Maison de la Tamise.</i>
<i>Pour le moment, le gouvernement
Britannique maintient une politique</i>
<i>de silence total.</i>
<i>Et l'attente continue.</i>
Voilà.
Laissez-nous en un peu, vieux !
C'est votre mari ?
Oui, mon bien-aimé.
Chouette maison, hein ?
- On fait de notre mieux !
- On a une douche.
En restant sous les étoiles.
J'ai vécu dans pire.
C'est qui la tapette ?
On n'est plus en 1965.
C'est une tapette.
Je le sens.
Que l'équipe de soutient
prenne les escaliers,
l'ascenseur est pour M. Frobisher
et son personnel.
Vite.
Bonne chance, monsieur.
Le grand moment.
L'Histoire.
- Y'a quoi là-bas ?
- Aucune idée.
C'est pour ça qu'il nous faut Lois.
- Aucun signe, lentilles inactives.
Deux minutes !
Je dois aller
aux toilettes.
- En ligne ! Elle le fait !
- C'est bien !
Je savais bien !
<i>{\pos(192,230)}Merci.</i>
{\pos(192,230)}Ne faites pas trop ça.
<i>- Ne faites pas trop ça.
- Pardon.</i>
- Elle ne t'entend pas.
- Je sais.
<i>C'est vous, Gwen ?</i>
<i>{\pos(192,230)}Oui c'est moi.</i>
Très bien.
<i>- Bonne chance.
- Bonne chance.</i>
Non, je déteste les smileys.
Ça m'a pris du temps
pour m'y habituer.
Tu les as utilisées ?
- C'est pour ça que Gwen les avait.
- Je les ai ramenées pour s'amuser.
- S'amuser ?
- Ouais.
Tu sais. S'amuser.
Ouais, je l'ai déjà fait.
- C'est amusant.
- Ouais.
C'est lui, c'est John Frobisher.
Enfoiré !
Ça sert à que dalle
d'avoir sa nuque,
on ne sait pas s'il parle.
Je suppose que c'est un honneur.
Vue la position.
Ceci dit, le Premier Ministre a
assuré que diplomatiquement,
il ne peut pas aller au 13e,
alors quoiqu'il arrive,
si un truc tourne mal,
l'histoire retiendra qu'il
n'y est pour rien.
Il m'utilise ?
On ne devient pas Premier
Ministre par hasard.
Bon sang, c'est quoi ?
Un genre de caisson.
Y'a quelque chose dans le gaz.
<i>{\pos(192,230)}Rapprochez-vous.</i>
Clem, venez voir.
N'ayez pas peur,
c'est très loin.
Alors ?
Ça vous dit quelque chose ?
Je ne le sens pas d'ici.
C'est ce qui voulait m'emmener ?
Je crois bien.
Vous avez déjà vu ça ?
Jamais.
Si je peux ouvrir la séance,
le premier congrès diplomatique
entre les représentants de la Terre
et les représentants des 456.
Je vous fais part des salutations
des États-Unis d'Amérique,
de la République Populaire
de Chine...
- Il nous tourne le dos !
- Je vois ça !
... Du Saint Siège du Vatican...
- Besoin de sa boche ?
- La ferme !
... De la Fédération de Russie
et de ses...
<i>{\pos(192,230)}Sa bouche.</i>
... D'Australie,
des provinces et territoires...
... Du Japon,
de la République Grecque,
de la République Islamique d'Iran
et la République d'Irak,
du Royaume d'Arabie Saoudite.
Il doit être noté au dossier que
tout pays non susnommés
n'indique pas qu'il
soit en retrait dans ce...
C'est ça.
C'est bien, c'est ça.
... Et n'est que le reflet du délai très
court d'organisation de ce sommet.
Vous avez des yeux.
Des yeux dans la pièce.
Le logiciel est moins bon de profil.
En accord avec les règles du
protocole, établies par...
- Ce n'est pas si mal.
- Ça marche.
- Tu détestes les smileys.
- La ferme.
Je dois vous demander de déclarer
si ces salutations sont bien reçues.
Me comprenez-vous ?
<i>Me comprenez-vous ?</i>
Je répète, en accord avec les règles
du protocole établies par...
<i>les Nations Unies dans les directives...
- Oui.</i>
Alors je vous remercie, au nom du...
<i>Alors je vous remercie, au nom
du Royaume-Uni.</i>
Ça a parlé ?!
Ça n'a pas de bouche, ça
a des fichus haut-parleurs !
Ça n'a pas de bouche !
<i>La Fédération de Russie,
le Commonwealth d'Australie...</i>
<i>{\pos(192,230)}- Les territoires du Canada
- Entends pas alien.</i>
le Japon, la République Grecque,
la République Islamique d'Iran,
la République d'Irak,
- C'est de la sténo !
- Je sais le lire,
ça dit "oui".
- C'est un cauchemar !
... Et le Royaume d'Arabie Saoudite.
Je crois que ça serait plus facile si
on considérait ces noms comme lus, non ?
- Ça fait quoi là ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- "Ça fait quoi là ?"
- Quoi, ça a dit ça ?
Non, c'est Lois qui demande !
<i>{\pos(192,230)}- Est-ce que ça va ?
- Aucune idée.</i>
Pardon, mais je ne peux m'empêcher
d'être inquiet, y a-t-il un problème ?
<i>Pardon, mais je ne peux m'empêcher
d'être inquiet, y a-t-il un problème ?</i>
Dois-je continuer ?
<i>Oui.</i>
Oui.
<i>Très bien.</i>
<i>Dans un esprit de coopération,</i>
nous avons une demande formelle
à formuler.
Que vous n'utilisiez plus nos
enfants pour communiquer.
<i>Dans le cas où certains groupes
ou territoires</i>
<i>le considèrent comme une violation.</i>
Est-ce acceptable ?
<i>Oui.</i>
Oui.
<i>Merci.</i>
Demandez-lui pourquoi
ils sont venus en Grande-Bretagne.
Ce n'est pas vraiment une priorité.
Demandez-le.
<i>Et comme cadeau,
comme accueil dans ce monde,</i>
nous avons préparé un document
résumant notre culture et histoire.
Ce document peut vous être
fourni immédiatement.
Bien que son format reste
indéterminé.
Le dit format
reste à déterminer par vous,
sans que cela ne constitue une
demande d'informations,
ni un transfert de technologies
spécifiques aux 456.
On me fait parvenir une demande
d'informations particulière.
On demande
pourquoi les 456 ont choisi la GB
comme point de débarquement.
<i>Nous sommes venus ici...</i>
"Nous sommes venus ici..."
- Parce que ?
- C'est tout ce qu'il a dit !
<i>Vous n'avez pas d'importance.</i>
<i>Vous êtes des intermédiaires.</i>
"Vous n'avez pas d'importance,
vous êtes des intermédiaires."
C'est faux, ils sont déjà venus avant,
c'est pour ça qu'ils reviennent,
pourquoi ment-il ?
C'est Frobisher.
Il le fait mentir.
Ils sont dans le même camp.
Quoiqu'il se soit passé avant,
ils le cachent.
<i>Nous avons une demande.</i>
Allez-y.
Nous voulons un cadeau.
Bien sûr.
Mais...
Quelle sorte de cadeau...
<i>Quelle sorte de cadeau précisément ?</i>
"Un cadeau."
Avec joie.
Mais que voulez-vous ?
<i>Nous voulons...</i>
<i>Vos enfants.</i>
<i>Nous prendrons vos enfants.</i>
Ça veut dire quoi, des enfants ?!
"Nous prendrons vos enfants."
Pour quoi faire ?
Pardon, je pense qu'il y a un
problème de traduction.
Ils veulent les prendre, comme
avant, comme l'homme avant.
Il revient.
- Il revient.
- Non, Clem, attendez.
Il arrive, il arrive.
Il arrive.
Il arrive, il arrive,
il arrive, il arrive.
Il arrive.
Il arrive, il arrive,
il arrive, il arrive, il arrive.
<i>- Quand vous dites enfants... ?
- Vos descendants.</i>
<i>La progéniture terrienne.</i>
Combien ?
<i>10%.</i>
<i>Nous voulons 10%.</i>
<i> Nous voulons 10% des
enfants de ce monde.</i>
Il n'a pas changé.
Il est pareil.
Il est pareil.
Il est pareil, depuis
tout ce temps.
- Comment peut-il être pareil ?
- De quoi parle-t-il, Jack ?
Clement MacDonald.
Rien qu'un nom de plus.
C'était plus facile, en ne
sachant pas les noms.
Tu y étais ?
En 1965.
Marchez vers la lumière.
C'est l'homme.
Non, ce qu'il fait, c'est
combattre les aliens.
Il combat les aliens,
n'est-ce pas, Jack ?
Non.
Qu'est-ce que tu y faisais alors ?
Je leur ai donné les gosses.
En 1965,
je leur ai donné 12 enfants.
Pourquoi ?
En cadeau.
<i>Dans le prochain épisode...</i>
Un immortel n'a peur de rien.
Trois, deux, cinq, zéro, zéro, zéro.
Il faut couvrir ça.

Target one's eliminated.
Two and three have escaped,
but we're in pursuit.
We can't have witnesses.
He gave the order to
have Jack Harkness killed.
Are you sure?
I've seen it with my own eyes.
ALL: We are coming.
We are coming.
Whoever they are,
they're coming for Britain.
Well, why? Exactly.
Why is that, Mr Frobisher?
He keeps saying the same thing,
over and over. We are coming.
I don't mean to scare you.
You're perfectly safe but I think
aliens are using you to speak.
What do you think?
There's no such thing.
How do we know that
the 456 will keep quiet? We don't.
All we can do,
is hope to cover ourselves.
This is us.
This is Torchwood.
This is home.
The children promised tomorrow
and tomorrow is here.
Our correspondents have
been measuring the situation...
Le President a declare avoir ordonne
la fermeture de nos ecoles.
The Senate have pointed
out that we are now
living in fear of our children.
In fear of what they will say next.
In fear of who or what
is speaking through them.
Whoa! Almost lost my eyebrows!
Still, I'm good for something, see?
Old Boy scout!
I'm freezing. Is anyone gonna
see us in here?
With all this firelighting stuff?
It was abandoned in the '90s.
Used to be a Torchwood holding
facility, Torchwood one.
Been rusting away for years.
So what do we do?
Just sit here?
Worse than that, do I have to stay
in these clothes? I mean, come on.
Tracksuit bottoms. Not a good look.
Jack, they're arriving today.
That alien voice-thing
said today and we're stuck in
the back end of beyond.
Yeah. But we're together.
The old team.
We're down, but not out, yeah?
We've survived worse than this.
Yeah.
Besides, I don't know how much
fighting you should do,
in your condition.
What does that mean?
Christ. Jack!
He knows you're pregnant?
You told him before me, didn't you?
Rhys, he happened to be there,
and it happened really, fast.
Last to know! Last to bloody know!
Thank you very much!
Don't be stupid, man.
Hey, don't be so...
Couldn't you just keep it shut?
All together.
The old team.
Tension is mounting as
the population of the entire
planet waits for the next incident.
..le Parlement Europeen semble fige
au regard de ces...
We've been given no answers,
no hope, no assurance that
our children will come first if...
The Government has refused
to speculate about the origin
of the voice or the importance
of the word "tomorrow".
Let's take you live
now to Downing Street.
In light of what's
happening with our children,
we've temporarily closed the schools.
As a further precaution,
we have introduced a temporary curfew
for everyone under the age of 18.
Keep your children at home,
where they'll be safe.
The curfew takes effect immediately
and will continue
until further notice.
But rest assured.
We are doing everything in our
power to find out what's going on,
to safeguard our children
and all the people of this nation.
In the meantime, we are asking
everyone to stay calm,
and to go about your lives as normal.
There's nothing to suggest we
are in any danger,
and as soon as we find out anything
more, the public will be informed.
And as always,
I thank you, for your trust,
and for your faith.
Yeah, it's me, listen, I can't talk,
just give her the thumbs up.
She'll know what it means.
Oh, brilliant! Thanks, Mac!
Mac says, thumbs up, Ianto's alive!
Is that it? You daft sod,
well where is he, what's he doing?
Thumbs up, that was all.
This is Eliza, and she's
lactose intolerant, so no milk.
Oh, right. You take your coat off,
you go in there and play, all right?
That's it now, Johnny.
No more kids! I'm full to bursting.
It's a public service!
The schools are closed,
people still got to work.
Life goes on!
Yeah, with you making a profit.
Ten quid a kid. Look, that could
be our slogan, ten quid a kid!
'This is Jack Harkness, leave
a message and I'll get back to you.'
So, we've got...
Guns, OK, and a pen knife.
Laptop, now dead. Credit cards
and a phone, which they can trace.
Lemsip. Book of stamps.
Pair of contact lenses.
And fifteen quid.
Plus 25p. With some bloody
alien thing turning up today.
We've got some Torchwood software.
We've lost the Hub, but the
software still exists on the server.
But we're gonna need some more
equipment, and electricity.
And how are we gonna manage that,
hidden away like criminals.
Well that's it. Brilliant!
What? Criminals. Thieves.
Us. Well, they're treating us
like criminals, let's be criminals.
Listen, I trained with the police,
I know every trick in the book!
I've seen the lot! Come on, boys.
You're gonna learn some tricks!
Everything all right?
Oh, yeah, fine, thanks very much.
That'll be Ł15.50, please.
Hey, come back, that's my car.
I'm just going to pop over the road.
I won't be a minute, OK?
Excuse me, could I borrow your phone?
I just want to call my sister,
she's a bit worried.
It's all this stuff with the kids.
My mobile's not working. Is that OK?
Yeah, sure.
I won't be long. Brilliant, thanks.
'Hello, Cardiff Bay police station.'
Yeah, I'm trying to contact
Captain Jack Harkness,
he works for Torchwood.
I know it's not your department,
but...
I think he was in that explosion,
I can't get in touch with him.
He's got this private number...
I'll need your name and address.
I just want to know where he is.
I'll need your name and address.
'Name and address, please.'
Lovely, thank you very much.
Thanks.
Name's Alice Carter,
maiden name Alice Sangster,
parents James and Mary Sangster,
significant because James and Mary
Sangster never really existed.
They were placeholder names,
used in the early '70s, for personnel
that went into deep cover
or witness relocation. In other
words, the whole ID's a fake.
Can you find out who she is?
I'm on to it.
Let there be light!
Oh, yes! Britain's most wanted!
Hey, how about that?
Guess that makes you an
official member of the team.
You can stick it, mate. Get on those
computers, and get me home, yeah? I
see we've got a new car outside.
Nice, very smart. Where've you been?!
We thought you'd got arrested.
Just buying essentials.
Technology's one thing, but let's not
forget the creature comforts.
Coffee, obviously. Got some do da...
Thank God.
And more importantly...
I didn't know your exact sizes,
but I reckon I've got a good eye.
Oh, brilliant, I am stinking!
Nice one! And for you, sir...
Army surplus special.
Oh, you are kidding me!
I'm back!
Such a long time ago.
But it's all coming back. Isn't it?
Cos of that smell...
Closer and closer. Happens today,
well, it's always today, isn't it?
Same as yesterday.
Today and yesterday.
I knew they'd come back.
Bastards always come back.
I can smell them.
Just like last time, isn't it?
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop! STOP! STOP!
That's him... No. Oh, no,
don't take me, they'll get me.
Hold on. No, don't take me,
get out of the way! That's it.
Come on...you're making it worse.
STOP! Stop! Stop!
They'll get me, they'll get me.
And we're in!
Just like the old days!
I'll patch into the new channels,
see what's happening. Black,
no sugar, yeah? That's the one.
No sign of anything. Empty skies.
Right, what are we looking for?
Run a check on
that Clement MacDonald.
And those names Lois said,
Captain Andrew Staines.
Was it Ellen Hunt?
Michael something.
All assassinated the same time
they tried to kill Jack.
Andrew Staines, Ellen Hunt,
Michael Sanders,
mean anything to you? No, nothing.
We need to get inside Whitehall.
Have you got the I5 software, Ianto?
Yeah, it's still on the site, why?
Download it onto the laptop...
cos these are
not just contact lenses.
These are Torchwood contact lenses.
But what do we use them for?
Who's gonna wear them? Well, there's
only one person still talking to us.
Hello.
Is there a Lois in here?
Lois Habiba?
That's me.
We're not a call centre, hurry up.
Hello? 'Lois, look to your right.'
Don't hang up. Don't hang up.
I need five minutes.
'Just five minutes.'
I've helped you once.
And that's enough.
If anybody finds out what
I'm doing... It's treason.
It's literally treason. Offences like
this can be tried without a jury.
They could do anything to me.
You said they're building something
at Thames House. We need to find out
what it is.
That's the most secure building in
the whole country. I can't smuggle
you in! You don't have to.
Just keep your eyes open. Like this.
But...
where's that coming from?
That's not a webcam,
that's you. And to the right.
And to the left.
And back.
Where's the camera? On your jacket?
In my eyes.
Oh, my God. When you wear these,
they'll transmit a picture
so we can see what's going on.
And more than that,
we've got lip-reading software.
Just look at someone when they're
speaking, and it'll translate it.
Press enter now.
Go on.
Now it's working. Say something.
Like what?
COMPUTER: 'Like what?'
Oh, my God, that's weird.
'Oh, my God, that's weird.'
And we can send messages to you.
Type something.
Go on, anything.
Hello Lois. You can see that?
In your eyes? It's good, isn't it?
If you wear these, we can find out
what's going on. And then,
we can help.
But I can't. What if they...I don't
know, scan for bugs, or something?
They won't register. I promise.
I can't, though. That's putting me
right on the front line.
You're the only
friend we've got left.
Even if I get into Thames House,
I can't get on to Floor 13,
where they're building this thing,
but Frobisher only takes Miss Spears
with him, I'm just the office girl!
Well, you'll have to find a way
inside. But how?! I don't know,
you'll have to think of something.
I can't! I'm sorry, I've got to go.
Just take them with you, I am
begging you, just think about it.
I've really got to go. Please, Lois.
I can't.
Please.
Frobisher's the key to this. He's
just a civil servant, he's nothing.
What makes him start authorising
executions?
What did it feel like?
I mean, getting blown up.
It wasn't the best of days.
No, but...did you feel it?
Or did everything just go black?
I felt it.
Shit.
Yeah.
D'you ever think that, one day,
your luck'll run out?
That you won't come back.
I'm a fixed point in time and space.
That's what the Doctor says.
I think that means it's forever.
So...one day,
you'll see me die of old age.
And just keep going.
Yeah.
Better make the most of it, then.
Suppose.
Like right now?
Ianto, the world could be ending.
World's always ending.
And I have missed that coat.
Rhys, d'you wanna take
the car and go to those shops,
down by the Wharf?
We need some disks for these things.
Should take about...20 minutes?
30 minutes. 30.
I'll go later,
the beans are almost done!
The beans are almost done.
Bloody beans.
Whoa, that's nice, look at that...
face recognition software.
And...
arrested two hours ago in London.
Wouldn't give his name, but that is
Clement MacDonald. From the hospital.
Could be useful.
Gwen?
I've given her the contacts, but God
knows, I think she's too scared.
'We've got a new mission for you.'
That Clem's turned up, in Camden
police station of all places,
arrested for theft and minor affray.
Could you get him out?
How am I supposed do that?!
'You were a policewoman.' Oh, OK.
Bloody hell, anything else while I'm
at it? Fillet steak would be nice.
Yeah, don't push it, see you later.
So Ianto, what's his story?
Well, according to Gwen,
it was your classic
alien abduction, as a kid.
1965. He was living ten miles outside
Arbroath, the Holly Tree Lodge,
it was an orphanage.
I looked up the files, the kids
were taken away in November 1965,
the Lodge was closing down, they were
being taken to a second care home
called Harbour Heights in Plymouth.
Except,
that's where the records stopped,
there's no trace of them arriving.
It was the '60s, a lot of
the paperwork's gone missing.
But if what he's saying is true,
maybe they never got there.
Show me those people. What people?
Andrew Staines, Ellen Hunt,
Michael Sanders.
Why, d'you think there's
a connection? Show me!
No, give me their history, show
me them 40 years ago. What for?
Just do it!
Who are they, Jack?
Did you know them?
I never knew their names.
Who were they?
Jack, tell me. Did you know them?
Jack!
Oi! The beans are ready!
Alice Carter.
I've broken the security wall.
You're gonna love this.
What is it? Any sign of Harkness?
Sins of the past. Did you
know that he's got a daughter?
Since when? Alice Carter.
She was put into deep cover
way back in 1977,
at the request of her mother.
Seeking to distance herself
from the life of Captain Jack,
can hardly blame her.
Who was the mother?
'Woman called Lucia Moretti.'
Italian,
Torchwood staff, 1968 to 1977.
Deceased, heart disease, 2006.
Natural causes,
that's rare for Torchwood.
'And now, Alice Carter's got
a child of her own, his grandson.
'Could be useful, what d'you
want me to do?' - Bring her in.
Just the answer I wanted.
Nothing from Jodrell Bank,
but we might as well get ready.
Bridget, get everything you need,
we'll transfer to Thames House.
What d'you want me to do?
Exactly what you're doing now.
Just answer the phones.
Well... I could come with you
to Thames House. I could help.
I don't think so.
The thing is...
Mr Frobisher asked me to come.
When was that? He said he wanted me.
At his side. What for?
Why on earth would he need you?
It was a...
private conversation.
You're not the first, you know.
Don't go thinking you're the first.
Then I can come?
Apparently so.
Andy Davidson. 'Andy, listen.'
You're alive?
'Yes, I'm still alive.'
Now shut up, I need some help.
We need you!
All those kids saying, we are coming.
And that's today!
What's it gonna be?
'A spaceship?' Aw, Andy. 'Godzilla?'
Just listen, I need you to release a
prisoner from Camden police station.
'The address is Albany Street.'
What are you doing in Camden?!
Does it matter?!
'It does to me, I...'
Yes. I know, I'm sorry. Look, just
listen, I've got no ID, so I need
you to vouch for me, he's only on
minor charges so I can stand bail.
'You need to phone them,
and fax a WC242A.'
Don't use my name,
use Lynda's, I'll say I'm Lynda..
'Can you do that for me please?'
OK. 'Like now?'
Clem?
Do you remember me?
It's all right.
I've got you.
It's boring. I want to see aliens.
Yeah. Be careful what you wish for.
Put some cartoons on.
Steven, come on,
we're going out, quickly now.
But the telly said
we've got to stay inside.
Never mind that, now listen to me.
We're going to go out,
and you're gonna be quiet, OK?
Don't make a sound.
Just like those games your gran
taught you, remember?
Gran always said,
there'd be trouble.
Then do exactly what she said.
Just like the games. Nice and quiet.
And don't let me out of your sight.
Come on.
Clear! Clear!
Get out of the way. Go on then.
Shoot. Let's see what happens.
Are you as immortal as your father?
Is the boy?
We can put it to the test.
Take me. Let him go.
No.
He's only a child.
So?
Alice. If we wanted you dead,
we'd have opened fire by now.
Just put down the gun.
Who are you? Put down the gun.
If you harm him. I will kill you.
Understood.
And the knife.
Certainly your father's daughter,
I'll give you that.
Come on, sweetheart.
Steven, what is it,
what are you doing?
Steven, what is it?
What's he pointing at?
Steven, stop it.
Please stop it! Look at me.
Steven, stop it!
It's them.
I charge extra for cleaning, tell
your mum, it's another two quid.
What is it?
Stop it.
Can you hear me?
Lilly, it's Mum.
just look at me. Just look at me!
What is it?
Clem?
It's them, it's all of them,
the kids. What are they saying?
I don't know, just pointing.
Yet again, every child has stopped,
every single child in the world.
There seems to be
no reports of speech.
Only that they seem to be
indicating something in the sky.
It's on the news, they're pointing.
I know,
but they're pointing over there.
What's over there?
It says, all the children in America
are pointing east.
And all the children in Europe
are pointing west. It's us.
They're pointing at us.
If you
go far enough in that direction
that's London.
They're pointing at London.
According to reports,
children in London are all pointing
towards the centre of the city.
To repeat, children in London
all seem to be
pointing towards the centre.
They're pointing at Thames House.
Come on!
It's happening!
Sorry, you stay here. Mr Frobisher,
you haven't got the authorisation.
ALL: We are here.
It's them.
They're back.
Come on. You're connected to them,
we need to find out how.
 'Speak.'
My name is John Frobisher.
Permanent Secretary to the
Home Office, of the United Kingdom
and Northern Ireland.
Earth.
On behalf of the Human Race...
Is there something wrong?
Do you want me to continue?
Then...
..if I could request,
for the purpose of communication...
We've no name for your species.
What are you called?
'You call us 456.'
That's correct.
'Then that is our name.'
If I could request,
on behalf of my government,
what is it that you want?
Can you hear me?
I'm sorry, but I need to know,
before I approach my superiors,
what exactly do you want?
I must ask the 456, officially,
your purpose in visiting...
'Speak.'
I AM speaking!
'We would speak.'
With who?
'The world.'
Why?
'We would speak.'
Well, perhaps we do
things differently here.
But we would consider this
to be a diplomatic liaison.
Does that make sense?
We are both, in a sense, ambassadors.
And according to protocol,
ambassadorial procedure
is not made public.
You wouldn't be speaking
to the entire population, but to
their elected representatives.
That's, that's, that's how it works.
That's all I can offer.
Is that acceptable?
'Yes.'
Good.
Thank you.
'Bring them.'
Thank you.
I have one condition.
Does that make sense, d'you
understand that? A condition?
The 456 have made contact
with this country before.
Many years ago.
It would be better if...
I mean, given the
nature of that meeting...
It would ensure the smooth-running
of diplomatic relations
between Earth and the 456
if that previous encounter
was kept off the record.
By off the record, I mean, private.
Between us.
Can you do that?
'Yes.'
Thank you.
'Soon.'
I'm sorry?
'Return.
'Soon.'
I will.
Thank you.
The area around Thames House
is being cordoned off
while the Government has...
It's all kicking off now.
Just when we need Jack.
'..at Downing Street.
'These images are from
five minutes ago.
'That's been identified
as Colonel Oduya
'of the Unified
Intelligence Task Force'
'and this is coming live
that's General Austin Pierce,
'representing the
American Armed Forces,
'he's heading
inside Downing Street right now.'
I have been asked to convey,
from the President of the United
States, his absolute fury.
Is that understood? Very much so.
That landing wasn't spontaneous.
It was planned,
it was prepared, by you.
And don't go calling
this diplomacy, Mr Green...
you have established a court.
The sovereign court
of Great Britain.
In direct contradiction of the
statutes of the United Nations.
We were acting under orders.
Did they threaten you?
I think we can say, the mere
existence of the 456 is a threat.
Nevertheless, you have an
alien ambassador, on British soil.
It has to be said, that Britain
has claimed no rights of territory
or ownership over species 456.
But it's here! You've damned
well got it, right here!
And at every stage of
these negotiations,
you have excluded UNIT.
When we're specially trained
to deal with these situations.
And I apologise.
But the President's welcome to
enter Floor 13, as is every
other leader of the free world,
I'd be honoured.
Except that's impossible.
And you know it. We will not move
the President into a location
that's had no security screening.
That would take days to organise,
weeks!
Then I offer to withdraw.
What does that mean?
I won't usurp the United States,
or any other nation.
I suggest that dialogue with
the 456 is taken out of my hands.
And conducted by the civil service.
They're still British.
But not elected,
with no authority of State.
And that's exactly what we need.
Middle men.
John Frobisher's already spoken
to the 456, I suggest he continues.
I'd suggest that UNIT steps in.
I wish it were so.
But the 456 chose Britain.
They designated the location.
It's out of my control.
What d'you want to do, anger them?
Look...
John Frobisher's a good man.
And better than that,
he's expendable.
So what d'you say?
Do we have your absolute guarantee
that you won't enter the room?
My absolute guarantee.
Then that's agreed.
Agreed.
'John?'
Prime Minster, Sir.
'We've consulted with the military,
'they've demanded that from
now on you become our spokesperson
in all negotiations with the 456.
'Simon can give you a security
briefing, thank you.'
Shit.
Oh, but I'm the last to know.
My own husband, and he
won't tell me what's going on.
I've got the girls, pointing
at the sky, and he won't say!
No, there's nothing, I've been
flicking through the news channels,
no-one's saying anything...
Yeah, yeah I know.
If I hear anything,
I'll let you know.
OK. Bye.
Lilly! Downstairs, please,
I want you where I can see you.
The so-called pillar of fire has
brought central London to a halt.
All roads leading to the
river have been closed off,
as a result all major thoroughfares
have ground to a standstill.
Motorists are being asked
to stay out of the city centre
except for emergencies.
Oh, that's so bloody Jack,
you should've stopped him!
Well, I don't know!
We're gonna be ages, it's gridlock.
Bloody London!
Half the people are panicking
and trying to get out,
the other half is trying to get in.
Look, I'm going to have to go, OK?
Bye.
Ey, it's all right, Clem.
You're safe. You're with me.
You're all right, you're safe.
I keep remembering more.
It's not just them, up there.
It's the man.
He's come back.
After all these years.
I can smell him. What man?
Who is he?
The same man.
I knew he'd come back for me.
All right. It's time
I got you a nice cup of tea.
And a hot dog. D'you like hot dogs?
I bloody love 'em.
I'm recommending we start at 19.00.
Gives us another two hours. now
this is Louise, she can advise on
international diplomatic protocols,
same goes for Samuel...
There's a creature in that room.
It's powerful, and it's toxic,
and it's capable of God knows what.
I bet you're glad to be
trotting after John Frobisher now.
Stuart's the linguistics expert,
he can help out, if there's
a problem with translation.
Excuse me, I'd better take this.
I was gonna phone you.
God, I wish I was home right now.
Look, just tell the girls that
there's nothing to worry about.
Oh, I'll tell them that, Johnny boy.
I'll tell them that their
father tried to have me killed,
how about that?
That's my wife's phone,
how did you get my wife's phone?
This is 1965, isn't it?
All of this, because of 1965.
Frobisher, tell me, is it them?
Have they come back?
Yes.
That's why you tried
to have me killed.
Along with Andrew Staines
and Ellen Hunt and Michael Sanders.
All of us dead, so no-one
could say anything, is that it?
I had no choice.
Well, I've got a choice...
'D'you want to hear my choice?'
I could blow this thing sky-high.
I could tell the world!
'Unless you get me
into Thames House.'
I demand to talk to the 456 myself.
'Think about it.'
The fact that they've come back
proves that they can't be trusted.
You need me.
Captain, we have your daughter
and grandson,
'Alice and Steven Carter
in our custody.'
You what?! I promise, nothing will
happen to them. My absolute promise.
So long as you agree to say nothing.
Well, how about I go back into that
house, right now, and get your wife?
'And your children?'
Except you won't,
cos you're a better man than me.
I'm sorry, Jack.
'The world is still waiting
for any news from Thames House.
'So far, the British Government
is maintaining a policy of absolute
silence. And the waiting continues.'
There you go.
Save some for the rest of us, mate!
He's your husband?
Yes. Yes, my beloved.
Nice house, isn't it?
Well, we do our best!
It's got shower facilities.
Just stand under the skylight.
HE LAUGHS
I've stayed in worse.
And who's the queer? Oi!
It's not 1965 any more.
He's queer. I can smell it.
If the support staff could take
the stairs, the lift is reserved for
Mr Frobisher and his personal staff.
Fast as you can.
Best of luck, sir.
Big moment.
History.
What d'you think's in there?
God knows. That's why we need Lois.
No sign of her. Lenses inactive.
Two minutes!
Um. I'm just gonna...
Pay a visit.
Online! She's doing it!
Oh, good girl! I knew she would!
Oh, God! Don't do too much of that.
Sorry.
She can't hear you. I know.
'Is that you, Gwen?'
Right then. Good luck.
Oh, don't do that, I hate smileys.
Took me a while to get
used to those things.
What, you've used the lenses?
That's why Gwen had them. I took
them home for a bit of fun.
Fun? Yeah.
Y'know. Fun.
Yeah, well been there, done that.
It is fun. Yeah.
That's him, that's John Frobisher.
Bastard!
Fat lot of good that is,
back of his head, how do we know
if he's saying anything.
I suppose it's an honour.
Given this position. Then again
the Prime Minister has
guaranteed that diplomatically,
he can't enter Floor 13,
so whatever happens in there,
whatever goes wrong...
history will say that
it wasn't his fault.
D'you mean he's using me?
You don't get to be
Prime Minister by accident.
What the hell is that?
Some sort of tank.
There's something inside the smoke.
Clem, come and see this.
Oh, come on.
Don't be scared, it's miles away.
What d'you think?
Anything you've seen before?
Can't smell it from here.
Is that what tried to take me?
Yeah, I think so.
Seen anything like it before? Never.
If I might bring into session,
the first diplomatic congress
between the representatives
of Planet Earth, and
the representatives of the 456.
I bring you formal greetings from
the United States of America, from
the People's Republic of China...
He's got his back to us!
Yeah, I can see that!
..from the Holy Sea of Vatican
City... Need his moth? Shut up!
..from the Russian Federation
and associated...
..of Australia,
from the provinces and territories...
..and Japan, and the Hellenic
Republic, from the Islamic Republic
of Iran and the Republic of Iraq
from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
and it must be stated on the record
that any country not named herein
does not indicate their
withdrawal from this... That's it.
Come on, good girl.
..reflects only the time span within
which this summit has been declared.
You've got eyes.
You've got eyes in the room.
Software's not so good in profile.
And according to the rules
of protocol, as established...
It's not too bad. It's working.
You hate smileys. Shut up.
I must ask you to state
whether these greetings are accepted.
Do you understand me?
 'Do you understand me?'
I repeat,
according to the rules of protocol,
as established by the United Nations
in the directives of... 'Yes.'
Then I thank you on behalf of...
'Then I thank you on behalf of
the United Kingdom.' Did it speak?!
It hasn't got a mouth,
it's got bloody speakers!
It hasn't got a mouth!
'The Russian Federation,
the Commonwealth of Australia...'
Citizens and territories
of Canada and Japan
and the Hellenic Republic,
the Islamic Republic of Iran
and the Republic of Iraq...
It's bloody shorthand!
No, I can read it, it says "yes".
This is a nightmare!
..and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
It might be easier if we take those
names as read from now on, don't you?
What's it doing? I don't know.
"What's it doing?"
What, is that what it said?
No, that's Lois, saying that!
Are you all right?
I'm sorry, but I can't help being
concerned, is there a problem?
'I'm sorry, but I can't help being
concerned, is there a problem?'
Do you want me to continue?
'Yes.'
"Yes."
'Right, then.
'In the spirit of co-operation...'
..we have a formal request to make.
We ask you not to use our
children for communication.
In case certain parties
or territories
might consider that a violation.
Is that acceptable?
'Yes.'
'Yes. Thank you.'
Ask it, why it came to Britain.
Hardly top of the agenda.
Ask the question.
'And, as a gift,
and as welcome to this world,'
we've prepared a document
summarising our culture and history.
This document can be made
available to you immediately.
Though its format remains
undetermined.
Said format remains of your choosing,
though this does not constitute
a request for information on,
or transfer of,
specific 456 technology.
I have been given a request
for specific information.
It has been asked...
..why the 456 chose Great Britain
as its chosen point of embarkation.
'We came here...'
"We came here..."
Because? That's all it's said!
'You have no significance.
'You are middle men.'
THEY CHUCKLE
"You have no significance,
you are middle men."
That's a lie, cos it's been here
before that's why it's here now.
Why's it lying?
It's Frobisher.
He's got that thing to lie.
They're on the same side.
Whatever happened in the past,
they're hiding it.
'We have a request.'
By all means.
'We want a gift.'
Of course.
But...
what nature of gift...
ON PC: 'What nature of gift exactly?'
- "A gift."
- Gladly.
But what d'you want?
'We want...
'your children.
'We will take your children.'
What does it mean, children?!
"We will take your children."
What the hell for?
I'm sorry, I think
that there might be a problem,
with the translation.
They want to take them,
like they did before.
Like the man did.
He's coming back.
He's coming back.
Not now Clem, just wait.
He's coming, he's coming.
He's coming.
He's coming. He's coming.
He's coming. He's coming.
He's coming.
He's coming. He's coming. He's
coming. He's coming. He's coming.
By children, you mean...?
'Your descendants.
'The offspring of the Human Race.'
How many?
'10%.
'We want 10%.
'We want 10% of
the children of this world.'
He hasn't changed.
He's the same.
He's the same.
He's the same. All those years.
How can he be the same?
What's he talking about, Jack?
Clement MacDonald.
Just another name.
It was easier,
if you didn't know the names.
You were there?
In 1965.
Walk into the light. Go on.
He was the man!
No, no, this is what he does,
you see, he fights them.
He fights aliens,
isn't that right, Jack?
No.
Then what were you doing there?
I gave them the kids.
1965, I gave them 12 children.
What for?
As a gift.
A man who can't die
has nothing to fear.
Three, two, five, zero, zero, zero.
We need a cover story.

We are coming. We are coming.
Where's the camera?
In my eyes.
When you wear these they'll transmit a picture back to us.
More than that, we've got lip-reading software.
If anybody finds out what I'm doing, it's treason.
Gran always said there'd be trouble.
He's got a daughter.
And now Alice Carter's got a child of her own, his grandson.
Bring her in.
We are here.
But what do you want?
We want 10% of the children of this world.
They want to take them, like they did before. Like the man did.
You were there?
1965. I gave them 12 children.
This is the location they specified.
A set of instructions, coming through
on a wavelength combination designated 456.
 Did they give a name? All we've got is that number. 456.
According to our alien friends,
in four months time, the virus will mutate.
It's a brand-new strain of Indonesian Flu.
They claim it could kill up to 25 million people.
All our research seems to back up their figures.
In 1918, the Spanish Flu outbreak
killed something like 5% of the human race.
I know. I was there.
Well, this time, we're being offered a cure.
They'll send the antivirus.
In exchange.
How many children do they want?
12.
It's like the sacrifice to the ancient Gods, twelve virgins.
Just 12?
Sounds like a good deal, what do they want them for?
They say they'll live forever.
Yeah. Sure.
Why d'you need me?
Well, assuming twelve children can be found,
then we need someone to deliver them.
In case the aliens are hostile? You need someone who can't die.
Actually, we need someone who doesn't care.
1965.
I gave them 12 children.
You just handed them over, and hoped for the best?
You just come with uncle Jack.
We're gonna go on an adventure, Yeah?
Everyone off.
Here we go.
All right children, you follow me.
Adventure.
OK, children. Walk into the light. Do as I say.
What's in there? What is it?
Just go.
It's safe though, isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it?
Yeah. It's safe.
Keep going.
You don't want to be left out, do you?
 Everyone OK? Yes, sir.
The information's coming through now, on the 456.
It's the antivirus, just as they promised.
Good night's work.
Maybe the Gods were kind.
Maybe they are in paradise.
No such thing.
You are in every nightmare I've ever had.
I'm sorry...
I'm really sorry...
I...
Gwen!!
 OK. It's over now. Stay away.
Just give me the gun, Clem. Come on.
You're on his side... Give it to me.
..and he's on their side.
You're all involved.
Gwen, let him go.
I'm not dangerous! We know...
We know you're not!
We know that.
But that's a lie,
isn't it? Isn't it?
We both know I..
I killed a man.
I am dangerous.
Can I take that?
There we are.
But it's wasn't my fault.
There is something up there. They do want children.
That man held my hand...
..and took me to them.
HE GASPS
This is normal, OK?
This is what he does. I told you he was going to be OK.
No! Come on... Clem? No.
 Clem! No, no!
He's all right, Clem.
This is too much!
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Oh, too much... too... too... oh.
Oh. You get to shoot first,
and ask questions later.
How good is that?
This is too much!
Isn't it? Isn't it?
HE GROANS
Watch your head.
I can't believe you didn't mention this before.
They didn't speak through kids back then.
I didn't recognise the signs at first.
That's not what I meant.
They're coming back.
The man who sent me and my friends to die,
can't die himself.
This is to do with Uncle Jack, isn't it?
It's a mistake. We'll be out soon.
Will he get us out?
Yeah.
In here.
He doesn't know Harkness is his grandfather?
No.
I suppose it would take some explaining.
Why Mum looks older than Granddad.
I can only assume that you're holding me here
as insurance against my father.
But let me warn you. If you've angered him, then God help you.
This from the woman who's spent her life running away from him.
And why d'you think I did that?
A man who can't die has got nothing to fear.
So you watch it. And you keep watching.
It was a protection racket. You must've known they'd be back.
 It was a possibility. But you still gave them their pay-off?
We had no choice!
Why us?
You wouldn't be missed.
I can see that.
All this time the one consolation I had, was the deal seemed to work.
It worked for 44 years.
That's not a bad breathing space.
Why was I left behind?
What's wrong with me?
We know they only want pre-pubescent kids.
Maybe it's that. Maybe you were just on the cusp of puberty.
Not quite adult, not quite child...
Saved by your hormones.
Everyone follow us please, thank you.
Is this still recording, Ianto? I need every second of this.
Yeah.
Hello again. Before we consider your request,
I've been asked for a point of clarification.
Before we even discuss your...
your request, we need to know exactly what it is
you intend to do with the children.
Somebody is watching.
Some remnant.
It knows I'm here!
It knows!
Somebody is watching.
I told you! It knows! Turn it off!
It's talking about the other camera. It doesn't know about us.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom
is watching through this camera here and he needs to know
what would happen to our children if we were to hand them over to you.
It is...
off the record?
Yes.
Come in.
Come in.
In there?
With your camera.
Come in.
It's hiding something.
Right. Is that OK? Uh-huh. Yeah.
Now you'll be able to hear us and we can hear anything you say...
OK, hand me a mouthpiece...
There you go.
Don't take it off until the light in the airlock goes green.
OK? Yes, Sir. Camera.
I'll be monitoring you throughout.
Good luck!
Thank you, Ma'am.
Air content stabilized.
BEEPING
BEEPING
HE BREATHES HEAVILY
SPORADIC BEEPING
I'm getting three heartbeats.
It's got three heads?
No, there's...
There's three distinct forms of life in there.
Get closer.
HEAVY BREATHING
RAPID BREATHING
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Is that a child?
Where'd he get him from?
It's one of the kids from 1965.
He's still just a child.
Do you think he knows?
Is he conscious?
 What's happening? It's Lois.
She's crying.
What have you done to him?
Get him out of there!
HE SCREAMS
Get him out!
It would ensure the smooth running of diplo, diplo, diplo...
between earth and 456, 456, 456, 456 if that previous encounter was kept off the record...
off the record...off the record.
What's it saying? That's John Frobisher's voice, what's "off the record"?
By off the record I mean private...
Private, private, private, pr-r-r-i-i-vate.
This is unacceptable.
We do not harm the children.
They feel no pain.
"We do not harm the children."
"They feel no pain."
"They live long beyond their years."
Oh, well that's OK then(!)
But we still don't know.
What does it do with them?
What does it want them for?
Bit late to ask now.
"We have answered your question."
"You have one day to select and deliver your 10%."
And if we refuse?
We will wipe out your entire species.
Am I to understand,
this country has had dealings with these creatures before?
Apparently so.
I would point out, I was only a child myself in 1965.
Nonetheless, you made the decision, only this week, sir,
to keep those previous negotiations secret?
It could be said, that perhaps it was...
convenient, for the moment, until further consideration.
You'll give us all files on 1965, immediately.
And the United Nations will decide what measures
to take against you, Mr Green.
This must have been eating away at you.
Why didn't you tell me?
I could've helped.
No, you couldn't.
I tell you everything.
Yeah? So tell me, what should I have done?
Stood up to them?
The Jack I know would've stood up to them.
I've only just scraped the surface, haven't I?
Ianto, that's all there is.
No, you pretend that's all there is.
I've lived a long time.
I have done a lot of things.
I've got to go. I won't be long.
You're doing it again!
Speak to me, Jack! Where are you going?
To call Frobisher. I can't make the call from here,
cos they'll be able to trace it. Is that OK?
You're the boss.
And just so you know, I have a daughter called Alice
and a grandson called Steven
and Frobisher took them hostage yesterday.
You two should get a couple of hours sleep, while you can.
So should you.
PHONE RINGS
It's Harkness. Ring Ashton Down.
See if you can get a trace on it. Strong coffee. Loads of.
Hello.
Have you thought about what I said?
Bit busy, to be honest.
'Let me put this right.'
Release my family, and we can work together.
Give yourself up, and they won't be harmed.
'I wish I could believe that.'
'You can.'
'You've spoken to the 456, haven't you?'
They want more children.
What makes you think that?
They're on to it now.
'It doesn't take a genius.'
And with them going so public this time, I think they want a lot more.
'Millions even.'
If I have to stop you then I'll tell the world what's really going on.
There's too much at stake not to.
Lost him. I'll try the echelon satellite data.
It's gonna take some time.
They'll let us know when they get a location.
He'll be gone by then.
Why don't you get your head down on the couch for an hour?
Sorry, um...
the Prime Minster wants to see you.
Take notes. Facilitate. Generally make sure it all runs smoothly.
Most importantly, blend into the background.
No-one should know you're there.
Cabinet Office Briefing Room A. COBRA.
Where all the emergency planning takes place.
Gold Command meeting's about to start!
They'll sell us out, just like they did last time.
I'm sorry to hear about your family, by the way.
We'll get them out.
I know we will.
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's been decided that we're going to make the 456 an offer.
A realistic number.
Something we can manage.
And then we see what happens.
D'you mean we're going to haggle?
What about the military option?
There's nothing to take action against.
Evidently, the 456 must have some sort of
base of operations, in orbit.
But our satellites are showing nothing.
Whatever's up there, it's beyond our technology.
There's a target sat in Thames House.
Taking that out would be a declaration of war.
A war we can't win.
That's why I've invited John to address Gold Command.
In terms of managing the figures,
what could we offer and get away with?
We need to know how many units would be available by tomorrow morning.
Isn't it? Isn't it? It's happening again.
My God! They're really gonna do this.
It won't just be Britain, will it?
The idea is that every country makes a camouflage-able contribution.
Can you pass me the F. A. S. file, please?
S. A. S?
Now you're talking!
Right. Well, erm...
..for a start, there are 21 children in Oakington right now.
21 units. Unaccompanied asylum seekers awaiting deportation.
F. A. S.
Failed Asylum Seekers.
Orphans in 65, asylum seekers today.
There's progress for you.
And no-one would miss them.
We need more.
Can you bump the numbers up to sixty?
I think so.
We could have them all in Oakington by first thing tomorrow.
Thank you, John. Now go back to Thames House
and consult with the 456.
Make them an offer of sixty units and no more.
PHONE RINGS
Hello.
'It's me.'
Well...how did it go?
All you need to know is, there's nothing to worry about.
I'm sorry I can't explain, but trust me, don't worry.
Well, have you slept yet?
No. 'Are you on your way home?'
No time for that, sweetheart.
I'm afraid it's a matter of utmost national security.
Are you safe?
Course I am. You know me, I'm just pushing papers around.
They just need me to make sure all the documentation's in place.
Did the bodyguards turn up?
They're outside.
'Good'
'Good.'
I just wanted to say, I love you, and I love the girls.
When will you be home?
Soon.
Look, I've got to go.
'I love you.'
I love you too.
I'm sorry, but we have discussed your demands...
And we've arrived at a solution that might satisfy both parties.
I've been authorised to offer you
one child...
for every million people on planet Earth.
That's about...
6,700 in total.
62 from the UK alone.
That is not acceptable.
6,700.
Six. Seven. Zero. Zero.
That's our final offer.
It's more than generous. I'll give you some time to think.
Three... Two... Five...
Zero... Zero... Zero...
Three... Two... Five...
Zero... Zero... Zero.
You are turning this house into a bloody playschool!
Ten quid a kid, more like charity!
And who's doing all the work?
Muggings here, that's who, I don't see you lifting a bloody finger.
Three, two, five, zero, zero, zero.
Oh, my God, they're doing it again. Mica? Where's Mica? Mica!!
Three, two, five, zero, zero, zero.
Three, two, five, zero, zero, zero.
What is it?!
Three, two, five, zero, zero, zero.
What you going on about?
Lottery numbers, or what?
Three, two, five, zero, zero, zero.
Three, two, five, zero, zero, zero.
Three, two, five, zero, zero, zero.
Coordinates? A grid reference, maybe?
'Children in different countries are saying different numbers.'
'Ici en France le nombre est de quatre, quatre, huit, zero, zero, zero.'
The children of America are saying,
"Two, three, four, zero, zero, zero, zero."
But what is the meaning of three, two, five,
zero, zero, zero?
It's confirmed.
325,000 is 10% of the children, the, er, units, in this country.
Every country is saying a different number,
which in each case, amounts to 10%.
I think it's fair to say that our "final offer"
has just been rejected.
OK, thanks, everyone, let's take a break.
PHONE RINGS
It's worth considering, sir,
the world's population will be nine billion by 2050.
That's a two and a half billion rise.
The UK'll go from 61 million to 77.
Every one of them needing food and water,
a home, transport, fuel, TVs and fridges...
Rick, Rick, Rick. What are you suggesting?
A cull of 10% would do us good?
I'm just saying, if we need to spin this to the public,
and God knows, at the moment, spin is all we can do,
then in an age when we're terrified by the planet's
dwindling resources, a reduction in the population could possibly,
just possibly, if presented in the right way,
be seen as...good...
..sir.
Anything?
It's all gone quiet. All our usual sources from the government,
the army, Whitehall, all gone silent.
Whatever's happening in London, no-one's breathing a word.
It's about time I found out what's going on...
I'm taking a squad to London, are the roads still blocked?
Only in the centre. Then patch me through a clear route.
And keep watching for Harkness. If it's happening in London, then that's where he'll be.
With regrets, ladies and gentlemen,
I have to tell you that we're now facing the worst case scenario.
And right now, we don't have time for a discussion on ethics,
the hand-wringing will have to wait.
All we can do at the moment,
is to address a number of vital and practical questions.
Namely, how do we select the 10%?
Who would go?
How would we transport them?
And how could we sell it to the voters?
John?
Well, the selection's not down to me.
Nevertheless. Practical solutions, please.
Once the selection has been made,
then my department can arrange to bus all the children
to the rendezvous points together, school by school.
My staff are compiling various school databases.
"You just need to decide what criteria you'd use for selection."
Which is out of my hands. Over to you, sir.
Anyone?
Might I remind you, the clock is ticking.
It would have to be random.
No-one'll believe it was random.
Not unless some of us are seen waiting at school gates for empty buses to return.
If the criteria we use is demonstrably fair
and entirely random, then at least we could defend ourselves against accusations...
So you're willing to risk your kids? To make it look fair?
 Then how else could we choose? We could do it alphabetically.
Oh, yeah. Thanks, Mr Yates!
I didn't mean... I've got no kids.
 I wasn't... No kids, and no consequences.
And yours have grown up... Let's keep this civil.
Oh, yes, let's discuss the loss of millions of innocent children,
and let's be civilised about it?
If you wouldn't mind, yes.
Could we limit it to one loss per family?
 Every second-born child? That would take time and organisation.
Time we don't have.
So it would have to be one school at a time.
Look, I'm going to say what everyone else is thinking.
If this...
this lottery takes place, my kids aren't in it.
I'm sure the families of Gold Command would be exempted anyway.
In fact, isn't that official policy?
..Isn't it?
..during a major civil emergency we're also dealing with deeply debilitating personal grief.
Listen to them!
It'll be hard enough as it is. I'm right aren't I?
It is official policy our families get protection.
Course they bloody do!
So, we could have a show of hands.
I hate to be crass, but in the circumstances...
Well, who votes?
Those with kids, or those with no interest to declare?
No-one votes.
It's down to me to make an executive decision.
 Do you need some time? No.
Whatever happens, the children and grandchildren
of everyone round this table will be exempt.
What about nieces and nephews? Don't push your luck!
You seriously expect me to look my brother in the eye?
We need to limit the number of people who know.
And what just give him a condolence card?
That's the responsibility of government, Denise.
No, the first responsibility
is to protect the best interests of this country. Right?
Then let's say it.
In a national emergency, a country must plan for the future
and discriminate between those who are vital to continued stability
and...those who are not.
And now that we've established that our kids are exempt,
the whole principal of random selection
is dead in the water anyway. Only so far as...
Let me finish. Now look, on the one hand you've got the good schools.
And I don't just mean those producing graduates,
I mean the pupils who will go on to staff our hospitals,
our offices, our factories, the workforce of the future.
We need them. Accepted, yes?
So. Set against that, you've got the failing schools.
Full of the less able, the less socially useful,
those destined to spend a lifetime on benefits.
Occupying places on the dole queue and, frankly, the prisons.
Now look, should we treat them equally?
God knows, we've tried, and we've failed.
And now the time has come to choose.
And if we can't identify the lowest achieving 10%
of this country's children,
then what are the school league tables for?
Anyone want to speak against that?
Then there we have it.
John, you have your criteria.
We have selected the 10%.
We've got enough evidence recorded here to destroy every person in that room.
And we can use it to force our way into Thames House.
Finally get face to face with this thing.
And get your family released.
 Everyone know what they're doing? What if I can't get Lois to agree?
She hasn't let us down yet. Rhys? OK?
Let's go stand up to them.
Yes, Sir.
'The government has yet to give a reason why the children have stated
'a number which equals 10% of the child population of each country.'
'..aurait demande a la Grande-Bretagne
qu'elle fasse une declaration plus vite concernant ses...'
'All eyes are now turning toward the United Kingdom, as we ask...
'What exactly are they hiding?'
'London remains grid-locked in the city centre...'
PHONE RINGS
Hush now, you lot, shut up.
 Hello? 'It's me.'
I thought you couldn't call here? Is it all over?
'It's only just beginning.'
'It's Ianto.'
Tell him I want my car back in one piece!
That column of fire over London? Did you see it on TV?
'No, I was watching the other side! Course I did, you dumbo.'
What's happening? The kids said,
'"They are coming," but who's they?
'Who is it?'
 Just stop a minute, and listen. Ianto, just tell me. Who are they?
They're from another planet.
They want children. That's why they're here.
They what?
'They want kids. Millions of them.'
 Why? 'I'm not sure.'
But don't let anyone take David and Mica, for whatever reason.
And this goes for you people listening in on the wire as well.
Forget the official secrets act.
'If you've got children, you need to hear this,
'and you need to tell every parent you know.'
I've found Jones, we can assume Harkness is nearby.
OK, let's go.
'Look, I've got to go. I love you.'
Don't let them out of your sight.
'I love them too.
'I'm even warming to Johnny a bit.'
We love you too.
Ianto?
Ianto, are you there?
What is it?
What did he say?
Come on, Rhi, what did he say?
You've got to go, now.
You're just getting me out of harm's way, aren't you?.
You don't think I can hack it.
You're the most important part of this whole plan.
Now go. You've got a job to do.
There isn't much time.
Long gone. Move out.
'I've done a sweep of the surrounding area.'
Two miles to the south, there's a warehouse area.
It used to be an old holding facility for Torchwood 1, back in the 90s.
'Could be significant, Ianto Jones worked for Torchwood 1.'
Can you pinpoint which warehouse?
'I'll get onto it now.'
We need a cover story to explain why
the operation is happening and to encourage participation.
So the suggestion is,
we announce that the children will be given some kind of inoculation.
A jab to stop them speaking in unison.
We stress that there's no immediate danger.
That everyone will be seen in due course.
Then when it goes wrong,
and the children disappear, we blame the aliens.
Claim ignorance, and face the music.
We say the 456 double-crossed us?
PHONE RINGS
OK, Gwen. We're here.
'Take care.'
Positive fix, Torchwood facility warehouse.
SIRENS BLARE
Excellent. It is the aliens' fault.
That is where the blame should lie. Not with us.
We play the part of naive dupes, rather than willing accomplices.
We're not willing.
No-one in this room is a willing accomplice.
'Roads all clear.
'ETA Torchwood warehouse, 45 seconds.'
Thank you, John. Comments? Anyone?
This is going to take a hell of a lot of organization.
We'll have to stand the police down and put the army in their place.
We barely have time to talk.
We need to get this thing moving.
Then shall we reconvene at 18.00?
Excuse me.
 Lois, stop it. I have something to say.
Really? Well, it's nice you want to make a contribution, er,
what was your name?
Lois, Lois Habiba, sir.
Well, thank you for your hard work, Lois, it's much appreciated,
but this isn't really the best time.
I'm sorry, sir.
I know I'm only supposed to be here to take notes, but erm...
..I am a voter.
This isn't a referendum.
Lois, could I have a word outside?
No, but it needs saying.
Lois. Seriously. Not now.
And I'm not just speaking on my own behalf.
Just what we need, a revolutionary!
If you like, sir, then that's what I am.
Oh, yeah, you and whose army?
Torchwood.
 What? Don't be ridiculous.
I think she's doing it. Good girl!
Torchwood has been recording all these meetings.
And everything that's been said, around this table, every single word,
spoken by every single one of you,
will be made public.
Unless you do exactly what Torchwood says.
Jack Harkness. Ianto Jones. We're Torchwood.
We've been expecting you.
On the floor!
Face down! Hands on your head!
 You traced Ianto's calls, did you? On the floor!
Now that you're here, you can take me to Alice and Steven Carter.
You'll be in the very next cell.
Second thoughts, maybe I'll just have you shot while resisting arrest.
 That would be a mistake. Why?
Look at what we've been recording.
'And how exactly are you going to make us do this?'
Torchwood's been destroyed.
I'm afraid not, sir.
Right now Captain Jack Harkness, head of the Torchwood Institute,
is in the reception of the MI5 building.
So you're gonna stand aside, and let him do his job,
and deal with the 456, immediately.
And, er...
..I think that's it.
What she's telling them is, my gorgeous husband
has recordings of them all secretly agreeing
to sacrificing millions of innocent children to the aliens.
Now, him, and his laptop, at this very moment,
are in a secret location
and he's ready to press send and tell the whole world
exactly what's been going on, unless you do exactly as we say.
Take a seat.
Maybe you'll learn something about the people you've been working for.
Come on, Clem.
I want to feed the live TV pictures direct to this number.
 Can you do that? I can do it.
I'm Captain Jack Harkness.
I've dealt with you lot before.
I'm here to explain why this time you're not getting what you want.
You yielded in the past.
And don't I know it?
I was there.
In 1965.
I was part of that trade.
And that's why I'm never gonna let it happen again.
Explain.
There's a saying here on Earth.
A very old, very wise friend of mine taught me it.
"An injury to one is an injury to all."
And when people act according to that philosophy,
the human race is the finest species in the universe.
Never mind the philosophy.
What he's saying is, you're not getting one solitary, single child.
The deal is off.
Er, I like the philosophy.
I gathered.
You yielded in the past.
You will do so again.
In the past the numbers were so small they could be kept a secret.
But this time that is not gonna happen.
Because we've recorded everything.
All the negotiations, everything the politicians said,
everything that happened in this room.
And those tapes will be released to the public.
Unless you leave this planet for good.
You yielded in the past.
You will do so again.
When people find out the truth, you will have over six billion
angry human beings taking up arms to fight you.
That might be a fight you think you can win,
but at the end of it,
the human race in defence of its children will fight to the death.
And if I have to lead them into battle, then I will.
You've got enough information on this planet, check your records.
His name is Captain Jack Harkness.
Go back 150 years and see what you're facing.
This is fascinating, isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it?
It knows I'm watching!
The human infant mortality rate is 29,158 deaths per day.
Every three seconds, a child dies.
The human response is to accept and adapt.
We are adapting, right now.
And we're making this a war.
Then the fight begins.
We're waiting for your reply.
Action has been taken.
ALARMS BLARE
What have you done?
You wanted a demonstration of war.
A virus has been released.
It will kill everyone in the building.
 Can they override it? I don't know.
The building's designed to withstand chemical and biological attack.
Nothing or no-one can get in or out.
Oh! Happy now?
The air's poisoned. Call someone. Shut down the air conditioning.
Block every air vent. Get gas masks, hazard suits, oxygen cylinders.
If there's a virus, then there must be an anti-virus.
Release it now or I'll blow a hole in that tank,
and we'll all die together.
You've made your point. Now stop this, and we can talk!
You are dying, even now.
SHRILL SCREECHING
What's that noise?
What's it doing?
Turn it off! Turn it off! Clem?
Clem?
HE SCREAMS
We've gotta get you out of here.
I can survive anything, but you can't.
Too late.
I breathed the air.
There's gotta be something, an antidote.
You said you would fight.
Then I take it back, all right?
I take it all back. But not him!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, Ianto.
No.
HE SCREAMS
The remnant will be disconnected.
He's dead.
What about Thames House?
They can't get out.
It's all my fault.
No, it's not...
Don't speak. Save your breath.
I love you.
Don't!
Ianto, Ianto, Ianto!
Stay with me!
Ianto, stay with me please. Stay with me. Stay with me.
Hey.
It was good, yeah?
Yeah.
Don't forget me.
Never could.
A thousand year's time...
..you won't remember me.
Yes, I will.
I promise. I will.
Ianto.
Ianto.
Don't go.
Don't leave me, please.
Please... please don't.
You will die, and tomorrow your people will deliver the children.
What now?
Two choices. Either we go to war against an enemy we can't beat.
Or we go to war against our own people.
For their own good.
An injury to one is not an injury to all.
We have to surrender.
35 million children?
Or 6.7 billion people.
Start putting your plan into action.
13, 14.
HE GASPS
There's nothing we can do.
Civilisation is about to fall to hell.
Do you think you're still players?
We can try.
Captain Harkness it's me, it's Lois. What do we do?
But you've seen what they do to them. Where are you taking them?
I'm recording this, so you can see.
You can see how the world ended.

<i>Il y a quelque chose que j'ai toujours
voulu demander à Jack.</i>
<i>À l'époque.</i>
<i>Je me posais une question
au sujet de son Docteur.</i>
<i>Cet homme qui apparaît de nulle part</i>
<i>pour sauver le monde.
Sauf que parfois, il ne le fait pas.</i>
<i>Tous ces moments de l'histoire
où il n'y a aucun signe de lui,</i>
<i>je me demandais pourquoi.</i>
<i>Mais je n'ai plus besoin de demander.</i>
<i>Maintenant, je connais la réponse.</i>
<i>Parfois le Docteur doit regarder</i>
<i>cette planète</i>
<i>et détourner le regard de honte.</i>
<i>J'enregistre ceci au cas où
quelqu'un le trouverait un jour.</i>
<i>Vous pourrez voir...</i>
<i>Vous pourrez voir comment
le monde est arrivé à sa fin.</i>
<i>Aujourd'hui,
nous allons protéger nos enfants.</i>
<i>Les écoles vont réouvrir.</i>
<i>Et nous vous recommandons
d'envoyer vos enfants</i>
<i>en cours dès maintenant.</i>
<i>Des représentants du gouvernement
vont se rendre dans certaines écoles</i>
<i>pour dispenser une série d'injections.</i>
- C'est quoi des injections ?
- Des piqûres.
- Je veux pas aller à l'école.
- Tu n'iras pas, de toute façon.
Tu restes ici.
Comme a dit oncle Ianto :
''Ne faites confiance à personne.''
- Mais il a dit qu'on doit y aller.
- Et je pense qu'il ment.
<i>Ces injections sont pour
la protection de vos enfants.</i>
<i>Ces injections sont sans danger.</i>
<i>Ces injections garantiront</i>
<i>que les problèmes de ces derniers jours
ne se reproduiront pas.</i>
David, debout.
Va chez les Baxter,
va chez Sally, et va chez Mme Singh.
Dis-leur que nous garderons
les enfants, gratuitement.
- C'est £10 par enfant !
- Tais-toi ! Et cours !
Dis-leur que mon frère
travaille pour le gouvernement,
- il a dit que ce n'était pas sûr.
- Oui, maman !
Donc, je vous demande de coopérer,
de renvoyer vos enfants à l'école,
et de reprendre
le cours normal de vos vies.
- On doit se préparer pour l'école.
- Non, chérie.
Votre père a dit de rester avec moi,
à la maison.
Pourquoi ?
En quoi sommes-nous différentes ?
<i>Et comme toujours,
je vous remercie de votre patience,</i>
<i>de votre compréhension,</i>
<i>et de votre confiance.</i>
On a isolé 2 600 écoles, Monsieur.
Désolé, mais vous devez vous adresser
à moi pour cette opération.
Cette information est pour M. Green.
Vous, M. Green et ce gouvernement
avez prouvé votre incapacité
à gérer cette crise.
Toutes les décisions passeront par moi.
Vous disiez ?
Nous avons une liste de 2 600 écoles.
Nous mobilisons les transports.
À midi, l'armée Britannique emmènera
les enfants de leurs écoles
aux points de rendez-vous.
Et si les soldats refusent ?
On pourrait avoir une mutinerie.
Ils ont été prévenus.
Tout soldat refusant d'accomplir
son devoir verra sa famille touchée.
Donc, on les conduit au point
de rendez-vous, et ensuite ?
Nous allons le savoir. Ils entrent
dans Thames House en ce moment.
Le désinfectant est inefficace,
on le sent toujours.
Il y avait des corps empilés
partout devant la porte.
M. Dekker, je vois que
vous avez réussi à survivre.
Je me suis tenu à l'écart, Monsieur.
Une stratégie qui a toujours marché.
Bon, il serait bien
de ne pas les faire attendre.
Je demande à parler aux 456.
Je suis le Colonel Augustus Oduya
de UNIT.
Si je peux parler...
Nous n'avons pas d'autre choix
que de suivre votre plan,
que Dieu me vienne en aide.
Mais je dois vous demander.
Nous avons choisi des lieux
de rendez-vous,
dans les bases militaires
des différents pays participants,
mais une fois les enfants rassemblés,
que va t-il se passer ?
<i>Comment allez-vous les récupérer ?</i>
<i>De la même façon
que nous sommes arrivés. Observez.</i>
Une sorte d'appareil de transport
qui les emmène
Dieu sait où.
<i>Et laissez-moi vous demander,</i>
pas en tant qu'officiel,
mais en tant que père.
Vous avez besoin de ces enfants.
On vous a vu connecté avec cet enfant,
mais pourquoi ?
- Est-ce qu'ils vous gardent en vie ?
- Non.
Alors à quoi servent-ils ?
<i>Le fix.</i>
Je ne comprends pas.
<i>Le fix.</i>
<i>Ils créent des substances chimiques.</i>
<i>Les substances chimiques sont bonnes.</i>
Bonnes dans quel sens ?
<i>On se sent bien.</i>
<i>Les substances chimiques sont bonnes.</i>
Elles sont comme...
Des drogues ?
Ce sont des trafiquants de drogues ?
Vous vous shootez avec des enfants ?
Nos enfants ?
N'oubliez pas,
c'est votre gouvernement qui
a commencé ce trafic.
Vous avez ouvert le marché
il y a plus de 40 ans.
- Les troupes sont-elles prêtes ?
- Oui, Monsieur.
Alors
on y va.
<i>Le gouvernement affirme
que les choses reviennent à la normale.</i>
<i>Les écoles du pays
sont en cours de réouverture</i>
<i>et il est demandé aux parents
de faire reprendre leurs habitudes</i>
<i>à leurs enfants.</i>
<i>Le programme d'injection
commencera à midi</i>
<i>et l'Organisation Mondiale
de la Santé a affirmé</i>
<i>la sécurité et les effets positifs</i>
<i>des traitements.</i>
<i>Certains demandent plus d'informations,</i>
<i>mais le gouvernement
demande qu'on lui fasse confiance.</i>
La menace plane toujours.
- Nous n'avons pas dépassé ça ?
- Mon mari est toujours caché
avec tous vos actes enregistrés
sur son ordinateur.
Un mot de moi, et il donne
cette information au public.
Que pensez-vous qu'il reste
de Torchwood ?
- Vous vous croyez opérationnels ?
- On peut essayer.
Nous sommes à un moment crucial.
La civilisation est sur le point
de tomber au plus bas.
Vous voulez commencer la descente
plus tôt ? Allez-y.
Il a raison.
Regarde ce qui est arrivé.
Appelle Rhys,
dis-lui qu'on a perdu.
Oui, c'est moi. Je me les gèle.
<i>Où es-tu ?
Tout va bien ?</i>
<i>- Tu veux que j'envoie les données ?
- C'est trop tard, chéri.</i>
Ils l'ont tué.
Pas que Clem, ils...
Ils ont tué Ianto.
Il est mort.
Et Lois ?
J'ai peur que Mlle Habiba
soit en garde-à-vue.
Elle est accusée d'espionnage.
Et ma fille et son fils ?
Ils peuvent partir.
Ianto Jones,
il a de la famille au Pays de Galles,
une sœur,
est-ce qu'elle est au courant ?
On ne donne pas encore
de noms.
Laissez Gwen lui annoncer
la nouvelle.
Vous l'avez dit vous-même,
le monde va sombrer.
Avant cela,
accordez-nous un moment
de grâce.
Ramenez Gwen chez elle,
s'il vous plaît.
Je ne peux plus la regarder.
Cellule M-3,
Capitaine Harkness, 9h50.
Capitaine, c'est vous ?
C'est moi ! C'est Lois !
Qu'est-ce qu'ils font ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
Vous m'entendez ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
Vous devriez jeter un œil.
- File.
- Je veux voir !
- Non, c'est pour les adultes.
- Suzanne, donnez-lui un Coca.
C'est à l'intérieur
de Thames House.
C'est Torchwood qui a tout enregistré.
Ils sont astucieux,
je leur accorde ça.
C'est un enfant,
il a été enlevé en 1965.
Maintenant, ils en veulent plus,
des millions.
Et dans 2h,
le gouvernement va les leur donner.
Oui ?
Vous vouliez me voir,
Monsieur ?
Asseyez-vous.
Terrible journée.
- Monsieur, je me demandais...
- Votre nom a été choisi, John.
D'accord. Très bien.
Choisi pour quoi ?
La théorie des injections
a gagné du terrain.
On peut même dire qu'elle
est populaire.
Très bien. Et quel est le rapport
avec moi ?
Vos enfants vont recevoir
une injection.
Je vois.
Dans 2h,
des médias se tiendront
devant chez vous.
On vous verra envoyer vos enfants
se faire traiter.
Ce sera diffusé sur toutes les chaînes
à midi.
Mais il n'y a pas d'injection.
Cette action aidera le public
et lui montrera qu'il n'a pas
à s'inquiéter.
Vous voulez dire que je dois
faire semblant de les envoyer ?
Vos enfants seront emmenés
à un des points de rendez-vous
et ils feront partie de...
De l'opération.
Il est de notre devoir
de voir plus loin.
Et une fois que tout cela
sera terminé,
le gouvernement devra
aussi passer pour
une victime des 456.
Nous devrons
avoir subi des pertes.
Si vous me mettez devant une caméra,
je dirai la vérité.
Et vos filles sauraient
ce qui les attend.
Il ne vaudrait mieux pas.
Je ne peux pas faire ça !
Je refuse !
Vous ne pouvez pas me forcer !
Dans ce cas, nous prendrons vos enfants
sans vous.
Mais vous savez ce qu'ils leur font !
Ce ne sont que des gamines, Monsieur !
Des gamines ! Elles ne sont pas...
- Elles ne sont pas...
- Je suis désolé, John.
Je suis vraiment
terriblement désolé.
Et terriblement occupé.
- Que voulait-il ?
- Il me faut une Réquisition-31.
Pourquoi ?
- Aussi vite que possible.
- Mais pourquoi ?
Une Réquisition-31, merci.
Réquisition-31.
Signez ici.
<i>Bienvenue au pays !</i>
Tout le monde est en attente.
Une alerte rouge.
L'équipement spécial et tout.
Tous prêts à se mobiliser, sauf
qu'on ne sait pas pourquoi.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Je ne peux rien te dire.
Je suis de la Police !
Pour l'instant, j'ai besoin
que tu conduises la voiture.
Et si je te le disais...
Quoi ? Allez, quoi ?
Tu détestes pas les gens
qui finissent pas leurs phrases ?
Du calme, elle est enceinte.
Merci.
Je suis là !
Ça alors.
- Il est de qui ?
- Tu vas en prendre une.
De Torchwood.
C'est leur faute.
Ils te donnent du Retcon,
des trucs chimiques,
des radiations et Dieu sait quoi.
La pilule n'avait pas une chance.
Voilà ce que fait Torchwood.
Ça te ruine la vie.
En quoi elle est ruinée ?
Tu veux élever des gosses
dans un monde comme ça, Rhys ?
- Tu t'en débarrasseras pas.
- Ah non ?
Tourne à gauche.
La sœur de Ianto
vit vers Cromwell Estate.
11h00.
Plus qu'une heure.
- Nous sommes en position ?
- Les troupes se déplacent, Monsieur.
Merci.
Je suis venue vous dire
comment nous nous sommes rencontrés.
Qui ça ?
Comment j'ai rencontré John Frobisher.
C'était il y a 30 ans,
vous n'étiez même pas née.
Je travaillais
dans la fonction publique,
en CDD pour 6 mois.
Et lui, il était au bout du couloir.
On ne le penserait pas
en le voyant maintenant,
mais il était très tête-en-l'air.
Il oubliait tout le temps
ses clés.
M. Swales ne pensait pas
qu'il irait très loin,
mais moi, je me suis dit :
"Garde un œil sur celui-là".
Les autres
ne faisaient que passer.
Ils voulaient aller trop haut
et se brûlaient les ailes,
ou trouvaient mieux.
Et vous savez ce que faisait
John Frobisher ?
Il travaillait sans relâche.
La tête baissée, il a travaillé dur
toute sa vie.
Nous n'avons pas travaillé
dans le même bureau
avant 10 ans.
Il m'a demandée.
Je ne pensais même pas
qu'il connaissait mon nom.
Et on a formé une sacrée équipe.
Je ne dis pas qu'il était parfait,
vous savez ça mieux que moi.
Mais il travaillait dur.
Il a toujours travaillé dur.
Je trouve que ce n'est plus assez
mis en valeur, le travail.
Et c'était quelqu'un de bien.
Je veux que vous le sachiez.
John Frobisher était quelqu'un de bien.
Parce que quand on écrira
cette histoire,
on parlera des ministres,
des soldats, et de ceux qui
sont désignés par des numéros.
Et je crois que tout le monde oubliera
que c'était quelqu'un de très bien.
Je veux que vous gardiez
ce souvenir de lui.
Si vous repensez à John Frobisher,
souvenez-vous que
ce n'était pas sa faute.
Maintenant,
je devrais retourner travailler.
Reste là, préviens-nous
s'il se passe quelque chose.
- Comme quoi ?
- Reste attentif.
Tu sais, Ianto...
- Il était gay ?
- Ferme-la.
- Ils l'ignorent peut-être.
- Alors, ne dis rien.
C'est bien ce que je disais.
Écoute, il se passe beaucoup de choses,
il faut que tu me fasses confiance.
Elle a 2 enfants, il faut
qu'on les trouve.
C'est pour ça qu'il nous fallait
une voiture, pour aller à l'école
- et les ramener chez moi.
- Chez toi ? Pourquoi ?
Il faut que je veille sur eux.
Fais ce que je te dis, s'il te plaît.
- Je suis l'officier de police Andy.
- Vous ne me ferez pas fermer !
Ils ont à manger,
à boire, de bonnes choses !
Et j'ai la permission
de leurs parents.
Allez, regardez,
je ne m'excuserai pas !
Trouvez-vous un vrai boulot !
Je sais qu'il me faut un permis pour
garder des enfants, je suis pas bête,
mais c'est une urgence !
- Je ne crois pas la télé !
- Je peux vous parler en privé ?
Ils ne paient rien,
ça ne peut pas être illégal !
Ce n'est pas au sujet des enfants.
J'ai à vous parler.
- Combien sont-ils ?
- 19.
- Mais que font-ils ici ?
- Pas moyen de les envoyer à l'école.
S'ils les veulent, il faudra
qu'ils viennent les chercher !
Je dois vous parler.
Ils ont des enfants.
Le neveu et la nièce de Ianto.
Sauve-les.
- Pouvons-nous commencer ?
- Nous n'avons pas le choix.
Ce n'est pas à vous de donner
les ordres, M. Green.
Étape 1.
Mobilisation.
Je me fiche de savoir qui vous êtes,
vous n'avez pas l'autorité
de débarquer ici et de...
M. Patel, ils ne peuvent pas...
Ils parlent d'injections, alors...
Où les emmenez-vous ?
Excusez-moi, où les emmenez-vous ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
Que se passe-t-il ?
- Restez de ce côté de la route, merci.
- Mais mon fils est là !
Vous ne pouvez pas les faire sortir
de l'école !
Où les emmenez-vous ?
Vous n'avez pas le droit !
Christopher ! Christopher !
C'est mon fils !
C'est mon fils, putain !
Vous ne pouvez pas les faire
sortir de l'école !
Ça va aller.
Ça va aller, pleure.
Il n'a pas parlé de ma voiture,
hein ?
- Non.
- Désolé.
Il voulait que je vous dise
autre chose.
- Et je suis désolée, mais c'est urgent.
- Partez.
Je connaissais bien Ianto.
J'ai travaillé avec lui des années.
Allez. Laissez-la tranquille.
C'est vrai... Je le connaissais.
On formait une équipe.
On a fait des tas de choses ensemble.
Et il parlait toujours
de son fichu café.
- Oui.
- Et il parlait de vous.
Tout le temps. Vous et les enfants.
Et son père.
Ianto a toujours été
très fier de son père.
- Que disait-il sur lui ?
- Il parlait de son boulot.
- Et quel était son travail ?
- Il disait qu'il était maître tailleur.
Il travaillait à Debenhams.
Si Ianto vous a sorti ces conneries,
c'est que vous ne le
connaissiez pas du tout.
Tenez.
Merci.
Ça a commencé.
Mon dieu.
Les chiffres ?
Nous avons rassemblé près de 60%.
Comme prévu, beaucoup d'enfants dans
les zones ciblées sont restés chez eux.
Alors on ferait bien
d'aller les chercher.
Étape 2.
Mobilisation.
Je vous le jure,
vous devez faire sortir
ces enfants d'ici.
Pouvez-vous les emmener
quelque part ? Un endroit sûr ?
- Gwen, allez. Viens.
- Quoi ?
Ils sont là.
Je n'ai pas le temps d'expliquer,
mais ils viennent prendre vos enfants.
- N'importe quoi !
- Fermez-là.
Ils vont entrer dans vos
maisons et prendre vos enfants,
et je suis désolée, croyez-moi,
c'est pour ça que Ianto est mort.
Il essayait de les arrêter.
Ils vont venir prendre vos enfants.
Vous ne les reverrez jamais.
Jamais.
Ça ira pour lui. Les bons
enfants ne sont pas en danger.
Si on doit se débarrasser de 10%,
autant prendre ceux dont on ne veut pas.
Tous ces enfants
qui traînent dans la rue,
on s'en débarrasse enfin.
Pendant que tout le
monde reste chez soi ?
90% qui serrent leurs enfants contre
eux, sans un bruit, comme avant.
Je ne connais même pas votre nom.
Je protège le pays.
On m'a appris à croire en
ce pays et à le protéger.
Et vous êtes bien utile, maintenant.
Même si 90% détournent le regard,
quel monde laissons-nous derrière ?
Je vous le jure,
si votre devoir est de protéger le
pays au delà de toute autre autorité,
la personne qu'il vous faut
à vos côtés est Jack Harkness.
À terre ! À terre !
Restez couchés !
Allez ! Allez !
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Bougez.
Capitaine !
Allez !
Que se passe-t-il ?
Capitaine Harkness !
Capitaine Harkness !
Eh, que faites-vous ?
Ce sont des espions.
On se tait, ma chérie.
Doucement, voilà.
On ne fait pas un bruit,
c'est comme un jeu !
Alpha 186 à Base de contrôle.
Quelqu'un m'entend ?
Le doigt sur la bouche.
Pas un bruit
avant d'être arrivés !
Reste bien silencieux
et tu auras des bonbons.
- Où va-t-on ?
- Derrière le champ. C'est barricadé.
Bien, on doit y aller maintenant.
D'accord. Suivez-moi, tout le monde...
Alpha 186 à Base de contrôle.
Quelqu'un m'entend ?
On joue aux espions. Venez.
C'est bien. Pas un bruit.
Tu viens ? Andy ?
Base de contrôle, ici Alpha 186.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Doucement. Doucement, allez.
Allez. On avance. Rhi !
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Occupe-toi d'eux. Je vais devant.
Quelqu'un doit les arrêter.
Ne sois pas bête.
Il ne s'agit pas que de nous, idiote.
Danno ! Où est Richie ?
Va le chercher, et Sammy,
ramène tous les mecs.
Que se passe-t-il ?
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Ces histoires d'inoculation
aux infos, c'est des conneries !
Le gouvernement nous a eus.
Ils viennent prendre nos enfants,
et on ne les reverra pas.
Ok les mecs ? On doit les arrêter !
On doit les arrêter...
Non, rendez-le moi !
- Oh, ça pue.
- On chuchote.
Je veux que vous soyez
aussi silencieux que
possible, comme des souris.
- Oncle Jack !
- Salut, soldat.
On n'a pas le temps !
Écoute. Reste avec ta mère, d'accord ?
Désolée. Pouvez-vous...
Je reviens.
Le nécessaire doit être là.
Sinon, on se le procurera.
- Pour faire quoi ?
- Émettre des ondes.
Les 456 tiennent leur
nom d'une longueur d'onde,
c'est forcément la
clé pour les combattre.
Vous perdez votre temps.
Vous ne pouvez rien faire.
J'ai analysé ces transmissions durant
40 ans et ne les ai jamais décryptées.
Qu'en pensez-vous, Capitaine ?
Elle m'a dit que vous étiez bon.
A-t-elle raison ?
Mettons-nous au travail.
Il faut que j'accède
aux logiciels de Torchwood.
On se connecte aux serveurs et...
Bienvenue à la maison.
Ça ne marchera quand même pas.
Vous n'avez rien là-dessus.
C'est inutile.
Nous avons des technologies
bien supérieures aux vôtres.
On a piraté Torchwood il y a des
années, imbécile. Vous n'avez rien.
Amenez-le moi.
Papa, viens voir ça.
Il y a une sorte de station pirate.
Ils essayent de tout révéler
au public. Mais ils
prennent les enfants.
<i>Nous diffusons ceci
depuis la fréquence 141.</i>
<i>Ce sont les enfants ! Dites à tout
le monde de se brancher sur 141.</i>
Il y a quelque chose que j'ai toujours
voulu demander à Jack.
À l'époque.
Je me posais une question
au sujet de son Docteur.
Tous ces moments de l'histoire
où il n'y a aucun signe de lui,
je me demandais pourquoi.
Mais je n'ai plus besoin de demander.
Maintenant, je connais la réponse.
Parfois le Docteur doit
regarder cette planète
et détourner le regard de honte.
J'enregistre ceci au cas où
quelqu'un...
Au cas où quelqu'un
le trouverait un jour.
Vous pourrez voir...
Vous pourrez voir comment
le monde est arrivé à sa fin.
Tu ne le pensais pas, hein ? Tu sais...
Te débarrasser du bébé ?
Non, bien sûr que non.
D'accord.
Je ne pourrais jamais...
Jamais. Je ne te ferais
pas ça, mon chéri.
Je ne ferais jamais ça,
et je suis désolée.
Je suis désolée.
C'est bon, chérie.
Diffusion illégale sur la
fréquence 141. Fermez-la.
Et fermez tout le réseau s'il le faut.
Nous en sommes à 80%. Les
gens commencent à se rebeller.
Colonel, nous annonçons 80%.
Est-ce acceptable ?
Nous avons rassemblé 80%
des enfants désignés.
Est-ce suffisant ?
<i>Tous.</i>
<i>Nous voulons tous les désignés.</i>
<i>Pas acceptable, Monsieur.</i>
Il nous faut le reste.
Autorisation d'utiliser la force
maximum.
Dernières nouvelles de l'Allemagne.
Une copie papier, à l'ancienne, désolée.
Le système s'effondre.
Vous n'êtes pas obligée de rester là.
C'est ce qu'il aurait voulu.
Vous pensez ?
Je ne vois pas qui pourrait vouloir
être dans cette fichue pièce.
<i>Oui. Oui.</i>
Si on leur renvoie la longueur d'onde...
Je sais ce que vous essayez de faire.
Une onde constructive.
Vous pensez que les gens n'y
travaillent pas partout dans le monde ?
Mais ça ne marchera jamais.
Ça reviendrait à crier
sur les 456, rien de plus.
Un simple cri.
Pourquoi Clem est-il mort ?
Les 456 l'ont tué.
Mais comment ont-ils fait ?
Et pourquoi ?
On a les enregistrements.
Son cerveau a dû se synchroniser
aux 456 quand il était enfant.
Mais il n'était pas dangereux,
pas besoin de le tuer.
À moins que la connexion
ne les ait blessés.
Voilà les 456 au moment de sa mort.
On a amplifié le son de la
liaison avec Thames House.
Ce bruit, M. Dekker,
qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Je ne sais pas. C'est nouveau.
Exactement.
C'est nouveau.
Pas besoin d'analyser la longueur
d'onde, il suffit de la copier.
Et d'en faire une onde constructive.
Mais on n'a aucun moyen de la diffuser.
Bien sûr que si.
- Taisez-vous.
- De la même manière qu'eux.
Je trouverai autre chose.
Qu'est-ce qu'il veut dire ?
Ne l'écoutez pas.
Dekker, dites-le moi.
Les 456 ont utilisé les enfants.
- Pour établir la résonance.
- Et donc ?
Il nous faut un enfant.
Comment ça ?
Une caisse de résonance.
Ce gamin va cramer.
Non, Papa. Non, dis-leur non.
Un enfant ou des millions.
Papa, non.
- Papa non !
- On n'a plus le temps !
Capitaine !
Steven !
Rhys, vite !
Ils arrivent ! Sortez !
Sortez vite !
Vite, sortez, on y va !
Venez vite !
Vite, dépêchez-vous !
Venez !
Vite, vite, vite !
Venez, venez !
Dépêchez-vous !
Sortez ! Sortez !
- Steven !
- Maman !
Non !
- Steven !
- Maman !
- Maman !
- Mon bébé !
Maman !
Steven, cours !
Cours ! Cours !
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait, Oncle Jack ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Steven, sauve-toi !
Steven ! Steven !
Cours ! Sauve-toi !
Colonel, au rapport.
Colonel,
que s'est-il passé ?
<i>Colonel ?</i>
Il est parti, Monsieur.
<i>Le 456 est parti.</i>
Qu'est-ce que t'as fait,
petite maligne ?
Qu'est-ce que t'as fait ?
- Qu'est-ce que t'as fait ?
- Viens là.
Laissez-la entrer.
Non, non, non, non !
Non ! Non !
Aidez-le ! Faites quelque chose !
Non, je vous en prie.
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi ?
Oh, je vous en prie...
Premier Ministre.
Le public attendra une déclaration,
Monsieur.
On peut dire qu'on a eu
de la chance.
Il est encore trop tôt
pour le dire.
Nous ne savons pas encore
ce qu'il s'est passé.
De la chance avec les américains,
je veux dire.
Le Général Pierce a pris le commandement
sans l'accord des Nations Unies.
On peut dire que les événements
d'aujourd'hui étaient entre leurs mains.
Et vous trouvez que c'est
de la chance ?
Oui, je trouve.
Votre première pensée en cet instant
est de sauver votre peau.
Dans ce cas,
vous aimeriez peut-être savoir
que j'ai rendu visite à quelqu'un
ce matin, Monsieur.
Je suis allée voir Lois Habiba,
vous vous souvenez d'elle ?
Je suis restée un peu avec elle,
nous avions des choses à nous dire.
<i>Et pendant que j'étais là-bas,
j'ai utilisé le Protocole d'Urgence</i>
<i>pour sortir une pièce à conviction
en particulier.</i>
Merci.
Des lentilles de contact, Monsieur.
Les lentilles de contact de Torchwood.
<i>Lois m'a beaucoup aidée, elle
m'a expliqué comment elles fonctionnent.</i>
Je les sens à peine, Monsieur.
Mais tout ce qu'il s'est passé
dans cette pièce
a été enregistré, Monsieur.
Cette vidéo n'attend que d'être
dévoilée au public
par moi.
Et cela comprend votre déclaration,
après les événements d'aujourd'hui,
vous vous sentez, comme vous l'avez dit,
Monsieur...
Chanceux.
Vous n'oseriez pas, je pourrais
vous faire arrêter !
Je ne crois pas.
Merci, Bridget.
Vous pouvez y aller.
Mlle Habiba sera libérée,
je m'en charge.
Je pense que je vais me charger
de beaucoup de choses
dans les jours à venir.
Ce sera tout, Monsieur ?
SIX MOIS PLUS TARD
Il n'y a plus de route.
On va devoir y aller à pieds.
Ça va aller ?
Arrête de me couver !
- Je dis juste...
- Non !
T'aurais pas pu choisir
un pub, hein ?
On se les gèle.
Les pieds.
Oh, ça m'a manqué,
les plaintes galloises.
- Tu as l'air en forme.
- J'ai l'air énorme !
Elle est magnifique !
Ça va, toi ?
Ouais.
Ça a marché ?
J'ai visité plein d'endroits.
Cette planète est trop petite,
on dirait un cimetière.
Reviens avec nous.
Je ne suis pas encore allé
assez loin.
J'ai pas mal de boue à enlever
de mes chaussures.
Et là, il y a un vaisseau de croisière
à fusion froide
qui parcourt les récifs d'ions
au bord du système solaire.
Il n'attend que mon signal
pour larguer les amarres.
Ils l'ont trouvée dans les ruines.
Indestructible.
Tout comme son propriétaire.
J'ai fait changer le bracelet.
- Ça m'a coûté £50 !
- Mets-les sur ma note.
Tu vas revenir, Jack ?
- Pourquoi ?
- Pour moi.
Ce n'était pas ta faute.
- Je crois que si.
- Non.
Steven...
Et Ianto...
Et Owen, et Tosh, et Suzie...
Tous, c'était ma faute.
Mais tu nous as sauvés.
Non ?
Je commençais à aimer ça,
et regarde ce que je suis devenu.
Enfin,
j'ai vécu tant de vies,
il est temps que je m'en trouve
une autre.
Ils sont morts.
Et je suis désolée, Jack,
mais tu ne peux pas t'enfuir,
pas comme ça.
Tu peux pas t'enfuir.
Oh, si, je peux.
Regarde.
Viens, on rentre.
Oui.
Oui.
Merci d'avoir suivi
cette saison avec nous.

ALL: We are coming. We are coming.
<i>We are coming. We are coming.</i>
<i>THE 456: We want ten percent
of the children of this world.</i>
<i>FROBISHER: And if we refuse?</i>
<i>THE 456: We will wipe out
your entire species.</i>
I can survive anything, but you can't.
No, no, no, no, no, no. Not him!
<i>THE 456: And tomorrow,
your people will deliver the children.</i>
<i>There's one thing
I always meant to ask Jack.</i>
<i>Back in the old days.</i>
<i>I wanted to know
about that Doctor of his.</i>
<i>The man who appears out of nowhere</i>
<i>and saves the world.
Except sometimes he doesn't.</i>
<i>All those times in history
when there was no sign of him,</i>
<i>I wanted to know why not.</i>
<i>But I don't need to ask any more.</i>
<i>I know the answer now.</i>
<i>Sometimes the Doctor
must look at this planet</i>
<i>and turn away in shame.</i>
<i>I'm recording this
in case anyone ever finds it,</i>
<i>so you can see...</i>
<i>You can see how the world ended.</i>
<i>PRIME MINISTER: Today, we're taking
steps to safeguard your children.</i>
<i>The schools are being opened again.</i>
<i>And we urge all of you
to send your children</i>
<i>back to their classes straight away.</i>
<i>Government representatives
will be visiting certain schools</i>
<i>to discuss a series of inoculations.</i>
-What's inoculations?
-Injections.
-I don't want to go to school.
-You're not going, either.
You're staying put.
Just like your Uncle Ianto said.
''Don't trust any of them.''
-But the man said we got to go.
-And I know for a fact he's lying.
<i>These inoculations
are to protect your children.</i>
<i>These inoculations are safe.</i>
<i>These inoculations will guarantee</i>
<i>no repeat of the problems
of the past four days.</i>
David, on your feet.
Go to the Baxters opposite,
then go to Sally's,
then go to Mrs Singh.
Tell 'em we'll have the kids,
only free of charge.
-It's 1 0 quid a kid!
-Shut it, you! And run!
RHIANNON: Tell them
my brother works for the government,
he said it's not safe.
Yes, Mum!
So, I ask of you now, to cooperate,
to send your children back to school,
and to resume your lives as normal.
-We'd better get ready for school, then.
-No, darling.
Your father said stay at home with me.
Why? What's so different about us?
<i>And as ever,
I thank you for your patience,</i>
<i>your understanding</i>
<i>and your faith.</i>
We've isolated
2,600 primary schools, sir.
I'm sorry, but you'll address me
in all matters concerning
this operation.
This information is for Mr Green.
You and Mr Green and this government
have proven yourselves
incapable of handling this crisis.
All decisions will now go through me.
You were saying?
We have
2,600 primary schools listed here.
We're mobilising transport.
At 1 200 hours,
the British Army will
take the children from their schools
to the designated rendezvous points.
What if they refuse, the soldiers?
We could have a mutiny on our hands.
They've been told.
Any soldier refusing to do his duty
will make his own family liable.
So we take them
to the rendezvous points, but what then?
We're about to find out. They're
entering Thames House right now.
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Disinfectant doesn't work,
you can still smell it.
There were bodies lying
1 0 deep around those doors.
Mr Dekker, I take it.
You managed to survive.
I just stood back, sir.
A strategy that's worked all my life.
Now then, best not keep it waiting.
I seek audience with the 456.
My name is Colonel Augustus Oduya
of the Unified Intelligence Taskforce.
If I might speak.
We have no choice
but to initiate your plan,
may God help me.
But I need to ask.
We have designated rendezvous points,
selected army bases
in all participating countries,
but once the children are assembled,
what then?
<i>ODUYA: How do you collect them?</i>
<i>As we arrived. Observe.</i>
Some sort of transportation device
taking them God knows where.
Then let me ask,
not as a representative,
as a father.
You need these children.
We've seen you hooked up to that boy,
but why?
<i>-Are they keeping you alive?
-No.</i>
<i>-Then what are they for?
-The hit.</i>
I don't understand.
<i>The hit.</i>
<i>They create chemicals.</i>
<i>-The chemicals are good.
-Good in what way?</i>
<i>We feel good.</i>
<i>The chemicals are good.</i>
They're like drugs?
(ROARING)
They're trading in drugs?
You're shooting up on children?
Our children?
Let's not forget,
your government started this trade.
You opened the market over 40 years ago.
-Are the troops on standby?
-Yes, sir.
Then we begin.
<i>The government claims
it's Britain back to normal.</i>
<i>Schools across the country
are being reopened</i>
<i>and parents are being urged
to return their children</i>
<i>to a normal routine.</i>
<i>The inoculation programme
will begin at midday,</i>
<i>and the World Health Organisation
has issued a statement</i>
<i>guaranteeing the safety
and beneficial effects</i>
<i>of the treatments.</i>
<i>Critics are still demanding
more information</i>
<i>but the government
is simply asking for trust.</i>
The threat still stands.
Haven't we gone past that?
My husband is still out there
with everything you've done
recorded on his laptop.
One word from me and he will
release that information to the public.
What do you think Torchwood is now?
-Do you think you're still players?
-We can try.
We're at a tipping point right now.
Civilisation's about to fall into hell.
You wanna start that descent
a little earlier? Go ahead.
He's right.
Look what happened.
Phone Rhys,
tell him we've lost.
Hello? Yeah, me, I'm bloody freezing.
Where are you? You all right?
<i>-Do you want me to send the files?
-It's too late, sweetheart.</i>
They've killed him.
Not just Clem, they've...
They've killed Ianto.
He's dead.
What about Lois?
I'm afraid Miss Habiba
is in police custody.
Charged with espionage.
Then what about my daughter and her son?
They're free to go.
Ianto Jones,
he's got family back in South Wales,
a sister, has she been told?
We're not releasing any of the names,
not yet.
Then let Gwen tell her.
You said yourself
the world is going to hell any second.
Before it does,
give us a moment of grace.
Just take Gwen home, please.
I can't look at her any more.
Cell M-3, Captain Harkness, 9:50 am.
LOIS: Captain, is that you?
Captain Harkness, it's me. It's Lois.
It's Lois.
Captain?
What are they doing?
What's happening out there?
Can you hear me?
What do we do?
Captain?
You might want to take a look at this.
-Steven, come on.
-I want to see.
Not now, darling, this is for grown-ups.
Suzanne, get him a Coke or something.
WOMAN: ...received and confirmed.
It's inside Thames House.
JOHNSON: All recorded by Torchwood.
They're inventive, I'll give 'em that.
That's a child, abducted in 1 965.
Now they want more, millions more.
And in two hours' time,
the government is handing them over.
PRIME MINISTER: Yes?
You asked to see me, sir?
Take a seat.
(CLEARS THROAT)
A terrible day.
-Sir, I was wondering...
-Your name was chosen, John.
Right. Good.
In what way chosen?
The inoculation story
seems to have gained some currency.
Might even be called popular.
Indeed. And what's that got to do
with me?
Your children will be inoculated.
I see.
In two hours,
there will be selected news media
at your house.
You'll be seen
to offer your children for treatment.
This will be broadcast
on every network channel
at 12:00 midday.
But there is no inoculation.
This action will help the public
and show them no cause for unrest.
You mean, I pretend
they're going to be inoculated?
Your children will then be taken
to one of the designated
rendezvous points
and they'll become part of the...
the process.
It's our duty now
to think beyond this terrible day.
And once it's over,
the government must be seen
as victims of the 456.
We must be seen to have lost.
If you put me on camera,
I will tell people the truth.
Then your daughters
would know where they're going.
Best not.
I can't do it! I won't!
You can't make me!
In which case,
your children will be taken without you.
But you've seen what they do to them!
They're just girls, sir!
They're just girls! They're not...
-They're not... They're not...
-I'm sorry, John.
I'm really...
I'm really very sorry.
And I'm really very busy.
What did he want?
Bridget, I need a Requisition 31 .
What for?
-Quick as you can.
-But what for, sir?
Requisition 31 , thank you.
BRIDGET: Requisition 31 .
Just sign there.
<i>Croeso I Gymru!</i>
ANDY: Everyone's on standby.
It's red alert.
Riot gear and everything.
All ready to mobilise,
except no one's saying why.
-What's going on?
-I can't tell you.
I am the police!
Right now, Andy,
I need you to drive this car.
And if I told you...
What? Well, come on, then. What?
Don't you bloody hate people
who don't finish their sentences?
Hey, she's pregnant.
Oh, thank you.
Who's she when she's at home?
Bloody hellfire.
-Who's the father?
-Oh, I'm slapping you, yeah?
GWEN: It's Torchwood.
That's what did it.
They give you retcon and chemicals
and radiation and God knows what.
Bloody Pill didn't stand a chance.
That's what Torchwood does, you see.
It ruins your life.
How is it ruined?
You wanna have kids
in a world like this, Rhys?
-You're not getting rid of it.
-Is that right?
Take the next left.
Ianto's sister lives
off the Cromwell Estate.
DENISE: 11 :00. One hour to go.
Are we in position?
Troops are moving in, sir.
CHILDREN: 2, 4, 6, 8, 1 0,
1 2, 1 4, 1 6, 1 8,
20, 1 8, 1 6, 1 4, 1 2,
1 0, 8, 20, 1 8,
1 6, 1 4, 1 2, 1 0,
8, 6, 4, 2, 0.
Thank you.
I've come to tell you how we met.
Who?
How I met John Frobisher.
It was 30 years ago.
You weren't even born.
I was on attachment
to the civil service,
only for six months.
<i>And just down the corridor,
there he was.</i>
You wouldn't think it
to look at him now,
but he was a clumsy thing.
Always losing his keys.
Mr Swales never thought
he'd amount to much,
but I thought,
''Well, keep an eye on that one.''
And all the others came and went.
<i>The high flyers,</i>
<i>they burnt out
or went on to something better.</i>
<i>And do you know what John Frobisher did?</i>
He kept working.
Head down, worked hard, all his life.
It was another 1 0 years
before we actually worked
in the same office.
He asked for me.
<i>I didn't think he even knew my name.</i>
And we made quite the team.
I'm not saying he was perfect.
You know that better than me.
But he worked hard.
He always worked hard.
I don't think that's
valued enough these days, hard work.
<i>And he was a good man.</i>
I want you to know that.
John Frobisher was a good man.
Because when the history
of this is written,
they'll talk about the ministers,
and the soldiers,
and the things with numbers for names.
And I think people will forget
how very good he was.
<i>I want you to remember him like that.</i>
If ever you think of John Frobisher,
just remember that it wasn't his fault.
Now,
I think I should get back to work.
GWEN: Rhys, you stay here.
Give us a shout if anything happens.
-Like what?
-Just keep an eye out, yeah?
-You know Ianto?
-Mmm-hmm.
-Was he gay?
-Shut up.
-They might not know.
-Well, in which case, do not say.
Well, that proves my point.
Look, listen,
there's a lot more going on.
You've just got to trust me.
Okay. She's got two kids.
We need to find out where they are.
That's why we need a car.
We might have
to pick them up from school
and take them back to mine, okay?
Back to yours? What for?
Andy, we've got to look after
these kids. Just do what I say. Please.
-Hello, I'm Police Constable Andy.
-You're not shutting me down.
They've got food,
they've got drinks, proper drinks.
And I got permission off their parents.
Come on, have a look.
I'm not apologising.
Johnny.
(SIGHS) Go and do a proper job.
I know I need a licence for a creche.
I'm not thick.
This is emergency circumstances, right?
I'm not trusting the telly.
If we could have a word in private...
They're not even paying,
so it can't be illegal, right?
No. I know. It's not about the kids.
I just need a word, if we could.
-How many are there?
-Nineteen.
But what are they doing here?
Well, they're not gonna go to school.
No way.
If they want 'em,
they'll have to come and get 'em.
ANDY: I just need a word.
They've got kids.
Ianto's niece and nephew. Save them.
-Do we begin?
-We've got no choice.
You don't give the orders, Mr Green.
Stage one. Mobilise.
I don't care who you are,
you haven't got the authority
to just march in here and...
Mr Patel, they can't just...
They said inoculations, not...
Where are you taking them?
Excuse me, where are you taking them?
What's going on? What you doing?
SOLDIER: Stay on the other side
of the road. Thank you.
But my boy's in there.
Taking them off the school premises,
you just can't!
Where are you taking them? You can't!
Christopher! Christopher!
That's my son! That's my bloody son!
You can't take them
off the school premises!
It's okay.
It's okay. Let it out.
He didn't say anything about my car,
did he?
-No.
-Sorry.
No. There's something else.
Something he wanted me to tell you.
-And I'm sorry, it's kind of urgent.
-You can get out.
I knew Ianto properly.
I've worked with him for years.
-Come on. Leave her alone.
-No.
I did. I really... I did.
We were a team.
We did all these things together.
And he'd always be fussing about
his bloody coffee, yeah?
-Yeah.
-And he'd be talking about you.
All the time. You and the kids.
And his dad.
That's Ianto, he was always
so proud of his dad.
-What did he say about him?
-About his job and things.
-What job was that?
-He said he was a master tailor.
He worked in Debenhams.
If Ianto gave you that old shit,
then you didn't know him at all.
Here you go.
Thanks.
It's started.
Jesus.
Numbers?
We're looking at an uptake of about 60percent .
As predicted, a lot of the children
in the target area have stayed at home.
Then we'd better go and get them.
Stage two.
Mobilise.
I swear on my life,
you have to get those kids
out of this house.
Is there anywhere you can take them?
I don't know, anywhere safe?
-Gwen. Now, come on.
-What?
They're here.
Oh, God. Look, I haven't got time
to explain, okay?
But they are coming for your kids.
I swear.
-Don't be stupid.
-Shut up.
They're going to come into your house
and they're going to take your kids,
and I'm sorry, but you've got
to believe me.
That's why Ianto died, okay?
He was trying to stop them.
They're gonna come
and they're gonna take your kids.
You'll never see them again.
Never.
STEVEN: Hey.
MAN: Hey.
He'll be fine. The nice kids are safe.
If you're gonna get rid of 1 0percent ,
then take the 1 0percent  you don't want.
All those kids on street corners,
we've finally got rid of them.
While everyone else just stays indoors?
Ninety percent just hugging their kids,
not making a sound,
just like they did before.
I don't even know your name.
I protect the state.
I was brought up to believe in
and protect the state.
Not much good now, are you?
Even if 90percent  look the other way,
what sort of world
are you leaving behind?
I swear to you,
if your duty is to protect the state
above and beyond any other authority,
then the one person you need right now
is Jack Harkness.
On the floor! On the floor!
SOLDIER: Stay down!
SOLDIER: Go! Go! Go!
-What's going on? Hey!
-SOLDIER: Move.
Captain!
SOLDIERS: (SHOUTING) Go, go!
What's happening?
LOIS: Captain Harkness!
Captain Harkness!
Here, what are you doing?
GWEN: Yeah, they're spies.
Hush now, darling.
Nice and quiet.
Don't make a sound,
just like a game, yeah?
Alpha 1 86 to Control. Is anyone there?
Fingers on lips.
Now, you don't make a noise
until we get there, okay?
You stay nice and quiet,
and I'll get you some sweets, yeah?
-Where is this place?
-It's down by the field.
It's all boarded up.
Right, look. We've got to go right now.
RHIANNON: Okay. Come on, everyone...
ANDY: Alpha 1 86 to Control.
Can you hear me?
RHIANNON: We're playing spies.
Now, come on.
That's it. No one makes a sound.
GWEN: Are you coming? Andy?
Control, this is Alpha 1 86.
What's going on?
Take it easy. Take it easy, come on.
Hurry, come on. Come on.
Keep walking. Rhi!
WOMAN: (YELLING)
What the hell are you doing?
You take them. I'm going out the front.
Somebody's gotta stop them.
No, Johnny. Don't be stupid.
It's not just us, you daft sod.
Danno! Where's Richie?
Go get him, get Sammy,
get all the boys.
-What's happening?
-What is it?
What's wrong? What's wrong?
All that stuff on the news, all that
inoculation stuff, it's bollocks, right?
The government has sold us out.
They're coming to get our kids,
and we're not getting them back, boys,
right? We got to stop them!
We got to stop them...
WOMAN: No! Give him back! Give him back!
-Oh, it's stinking!
-(WHISPERING) Keep your voice down.
Yeah, what I need you to do is to be
as quiet as you possibly can, like mice.
-Uncle Jack!
-(CHUCKLES) Hey, soldier.
-Whoa!
-We haven't got time!
Listen. Stay with your mom, okay?
Sorry. Would you...
I'll be back.
This should be everything you need.
And if it's not, we'll find it.
-For what?
-Wavelengths.
The 456 are named after a wavelength,
and that's got to be the key
to fighting back.
You're wasting your time.
There's nothing you can do.
I've analysed those transmissions
for 40 years and never broke 'em.
What do you think, Captain?
She told me you were good.
Was she right?
Let's get to work.
Get me access
to the Torchwood software.
Log on to the servers and...
Welcome back.
It still won't work.
There's nothing on there.
It's useless.
We've got technology way beyond you.
We hacked into Torchwood years ago,
you idiot. There's nothing.
Bring him over here.
Dad, come and look at this.
It's some sort of pirate station.
They're trying to get the story
out to the public.
But they're taking the kids.
<i>WOMAN: We're broadcasting this
on Digital 1 4 1.</i>
<i>It's the kids!
Tell everyone to tune in to 1 4 1.</i>
There's one thing
I always meant to ask Jack.
Back in the old days.
I wanted to know
about that Doctor of his.
All those times in history
when there's no sign of him,
I wanted to know why not.
But I don't need to ask any more.
I know the answer now.
Sometimes the Doctor
must look at this planet
and turn away in shame.
I'm recording this
in case anyone...
(SIGHS)
...in case anyone ever finds it,
so you can see...
<i>You can see how the world ended.</i>
RHYS: (STUTTERING)
You didn't mean it, did you? About...
Getting rid of it?
No, of course I didn't.
Okay.
I would never...
Never. I wouldn't do that
to you, sweetheart.
No, I wouldn't, and I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. All right, darling?
Illegal broadcast on Digital 1 41 .
Close it down.
And take out the whole network
if you have to.
We're up to 80percentper.
The people are starting to fight back.
Colonel, we're predicting 80percent .
<i>Is that acceptable?</i>
We have up to 80percent
of the designated children.
Is that enough?
<i>THE 456: All of them.</i>
<i>All of the designated to us.</i>
<i>ODUYA: Not acceptable, sir.</i>
We need the rest.
Authorising maximum force.
The latest report from Germany.
Old-fashioned hard copy, I'm afraid.
The system's gone into meltdown.
You don't have to be here.
It's what he would have wanted.
Do you think so? I can't imagine anyone
wanting to be in this bloody room.
Yes. Yes.
If we cycle the wavelength
back at them...
I know what you're trying to do.
A constructive wave.
Do you think people aren't working
on that all over the world?
But it's never going to work.
The effect would be like
shouting at the 456, that's all.
Just shouting.
Why did Clem die?
It was the 456 that killed him.
But how did they do it?
Why did they do it?
We've got the recording here.
His mind must have synced to the 456
back when he was a child.
But they didn't need to kill him.
He wasn't any threat.
Unless maybe that connection hurt them.
This is the 456
at the moment of his death.
We've lifted the sound
from the Thames House link.
That sound, Mr Dekker,
what's that sound?
I don't know. It's new.
Exactly. It's new.
We don't have to analyse the wavelength,
just copy it.
Turn it into a constructive wave.
But we've got no way of transmitting.
Of course you have.
-Shut up.
-Same way as them.
I'll find something else.
What does he mean?
Don't listen to him.
Dekker, tell me.
The 456 used children.
-To establish the resonance.
-JOHNSON: Meaning what?
We need a child.
What do you mean?
DEKKER: Centre of the resonance.
Oh, that child's going to fry.
No, Dad. No, tell them no.
JOHNSON: One child or millions.
Dad, no.
-Dad, tell them no!
-We're running out of time.
Dad, no! No, Dad!
JOHNSON: Captain!
ALICE: (SCREAMING) Steven!
Rhys. Quick.
Incoming! Everybody out!
Quick! Everybody out!
Quick! Come on! Let's go!
Quick! Come on!
Quick! Come on. Quick, out.
GWEN: Come on.
Quick, quick, quick, quick!
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on, quick.
GIRL: Get away! Get away!
Steven! Steven!
-Steven!
-Mummy!
ALICE: No!
-Steven!
-Mummy!
-Mummy!
-My baby!
Mummy!
Steven, run away!
Run! Run!
What are we doing, Uncle Jack?
What's happening?
What do you want me to do?
Steven, get away!
No!
Steven! Steven!
Run! Run!
Colonel, do we have a report?
Colonel, what happened?
<i>Colonel?</i>
It's gone, sir.
<i>The 456 has gone.</i>
What did you do, clever girl?
What did you do?
-What did you do?
-RHYS: Hey?
Oh!
JOHNSON: Let her in.
No, no, no, no, no!
No! No!
Somebody help him. Help him!
No, please, no.
Why? Why?
Oh, please...
Prime Minister.
The public will be wanting
a statement, sir.
I suppose you could say we were lucky.
A bit soon to tell.
We don't know exactly what happened yet.
Lucky with the Americans, I mean.
General Pierce took charge without
ratification from the United Nations.
We can say that today's events
were in American hands.
And do you think that's lucky?
Yes, I do, rather.
Your first thought now
is to save your own skin.
In which case, you might like to know,
I paid a visit this morning, sir.
I went to see Lois Habiba.
You might remember her.
I sat with her a while.
We had a number of things to discuss.
<i>And while I was there,
I used the emergency protocols</i>
<i>to sign out
a particular piece of evidence.</i>
POLICEMAN: Thank you.
Contact lenses, sir.
The Torchwood contact lenses.
<i>And Lois was very helpful.
She told me how they worked.</i>
I can hardly feel them, sir.
But everything that happened
in this room
has been recorded, sir.
All waiting to be made public, by me.
Including your statement just now
that after the events of today
you feel, as you said
in your very own words, sir,
lucky.
You wouldn't dare.
I can have you arrested.
I don't think so.
Thank you, Bridget. You're free to go.
And Miss Habiba will be released.
I'll see to it myself.
I think I'll be taking charge
of very many things
in the days to come.
Is that all, sir?
<i>STEVEN: Uncle Jack!
JACK: Hey, soldier.</i>
There's no more road.
We'll have to walk from now on.
You all right?
You fuss over me one more time...
-I'm just saying.
-Well, don't.
Couldn't have
just chosen a pub, could you?
RHYS: It's bloody freezing.
My feet.
Oh, I miss that, the Welsh complaining.
-You look good.
-I look huge.
She's bloody gorgeous.
You okay?
Yeah.
Did it work?
Travelled all sorts of places.
This planet is too small.
The whole world is like a graveyard.
Come back with us.
Haven't travelled far enough yet.
Got a lot of dirt to shake off my shoes.
And right now,
there's a cold-fusion cruiser
surfing the ion reefs
just at the edge of the solar system,
just waiting to open its transport dock.
I just need to send a signal.
They found it in the wreckage.
Indestructible.
Like its owner.
I put on a new strap for you.
-Cost me 50 quid, that.
-Bill me.
Are you ever coming back, Jack?
-What for?
-For me.
It wasn't your fault.
-I think it was.
-No.
Steven and Ianto
and Owen and Tosh and Suzie and...
All of them, because of me.
But you saved us.
Didn't you?
I began to like it.
And look what I became.
Still,
I have lived so many lives.
It's time to find another one.
They died.
And I am sorry, Jack,
but you cannot just run away.
You cannot run away.
Oh, yes, I can.
Just watch me.
Let's go home, yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
