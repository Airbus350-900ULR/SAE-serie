-So, your boy's name is what?
-Snot.
-You called the guy Snot?
-Snotboogie, yeah.
"Snotboogie."
He like the name?
-What?
-Snotboogie.
This kid whose mama went to the trouble
of christening him Omar lsaiah Betts?
You know, he forgets his jacket...
so his nose starts running,
and some asshole...
instead of giving him a Kleenex,
he calls him "Snot."
So, he's "Snot" forever.
Doesn't seem fair.
Life just be that way, I guess.
So who shot Snot?
I ain't going to no court.
Motherfucker ain't have
to put no cap in him though.
Definitely not.
He could've just whipped his ass,
like we always whip his ass.
-I agree with you.
-He gonna kill Snot.
Snot been doing the same shit
since I don't know how long.
Kill a man over some bullshit.
I'm saying, every Friday night...
in the alley behind the cut-rate,
we rolling bones, you know?
All the boys from around the way,
we roll till late.
Alley crap game, right?
And like every time,
Snot, he'd fade a few shooters.
Play it out till the pot's deep.
Then he'd snatch and run.
-Every time?
-Couldn't help hisself.
Let me understand you.
Every Friday night,
you and your boys would shoot crap, right?
And every Friday night,
your pal Snotboogie...
he'd wait till there was cash on the ground,
then grab the money and run away?
-You let him do that?
-We catch him and beat his ass.
But ain't nobody ever go past that.
I gotta ask you.
If every time Snotboogie
would grab the money and run away...
why'd you even let him in the game?
What?
If Snotboogie always stole the money,
why'd you let him play?
Got to. This America, man.
-Guess what he says.
-What?
"Gotta let him play, this America."
No fucking way.
-Would I make it up?
-He give you the shooter?
Three Newports and a Grape Nehi
he's grand juried.
It's down, Bunk.
Barksdale's in Part 1 2, right?
Project murder, Westside.
-Which one, now?
-Never mind.
Gonna sit in on it for a bit.
Where you gonna be?
I'm gonna drop this off on Nathan,
then I'm going to the office.
-Don't answer no phones, Bunk.
-Yeah, yeah.
And is that your signature
on that photo array card?
Yes.
And those are your initials as well,
next to the photo you identified?
Yes.
Mr. Gant, do you see the man you identified
from that photo array card...
sitting in the courtroom today?
He's right there.
For the record, the witness
has identified the defendant...
D'Angelo Barksdale.
-Your witness.
-Thank you.
Just one question, Mr. Gant.
Have you ever seen this young man
before the day in question?
-No.
-No further questions, your honor.
You're excused, Mr. Gant.
Call your next witness.
State calls Nakeisha Lyles, Your Honor.
Do you promise to tell
the truth, the whole truth...
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do.
-Ma'am, can you state your name, please?
-Nakeisha Lyles.
-And are you employed?
-Yes, I am.
-And what is your occupation, Ms. Lyles?
-I'm a security guard.
And were you employed as a security guard
on May 4, the day of the shooting?
-What were your duties on that date?
-I was in the booth of 221 .
And is that the guard booth in the lobby
of the Fremont Avenue high-rise?
Yes.
And you're behind bullet-proof glass,
with a clear view of the lobby?
-Yeah.
-Good.
Now, Ms. Lyles, I know
this may be difficult for you...
but can you tell us what you saw?
A man, you know,
he was waiting for the elevator...
and when another man
just starts beating on him...
and like, the one man,
he got knocked down--
-The victim got knocked down?
-No, the man with the gun.
The man who was knocked down had a gun.
And do you see that man
in the courtroom today?
Nope.
Excuse me?
He ain't here.
You don't....
You testified.
Ms. Lyles, do you remember
when Detective Barlow...
showed you this photo array?
-Yeah.
-Good.
I call your attention to your initials
which identify this photo...
as the man who shot Mr. Blanchard.
Did you write your initials
above that photograph?
He ain't the one that did the shooting.
But you identified him.
That's 'cause
he looked like the boy that did it.
See, the one that did it,
I saw him come in the building a week later.
You saw someone else
you thought did the shooting?
Right, a week later.
Ms. Lyles, when you spoke
with the detectives...
you never said anything about--
I tried. I called Detective....
Yeah, Detective Barlow on May 13th at 2:00.
-But he didn't call me back.
-Nicely done.
-You called Detective Barlow?
-Yeah, twice.
Yeah, I wrote it down in the log.
-I need a price for pressure-treated.
-$14.
That's the price that
you were going to quote me?
Do you feel that, Mikey, do you feel it?
'Cause I swear to God
that is my fucking dick in your ear.
-That's nice.
-Hang on, you fucking thief.
What's up?
-You been down the hall lately?
-What?
Your case just hit the wall.
Barksdale's crew, they turned it.
Two eyewitnesses and a statement.
No fucking way, pal.
You listen to me, you little shit,
there is no way in hell I am paying that.
No.
You use my goddamn car
to chauffeur that dusty bitch around.
-Yo, ease up.
-You don't understand.
-I did it for that man and he do this.
-Getting heated ain't gonna help.
-Greggs, what's your bird saying?
-It ain't what she says.
Yeah? What do you say?
I say we wait, shithead.
-That's him.
-All right, easy, girl.
-Yo, Herc, you got that?
-Yeah, we see.
-Are the uniforms on the horn?
-They're on hold.
-That's Ghost.
-All right, good, Tiff.
Now tell me what I'm seeing, girl.
-He gonna get little Mike.
-Then what?
Mike come back with the money.
Wait on the drop,
take the car when it's deep in the block.
-I don't want no foot chase.
-Copy.
Got it.
Go, go, go. The driver's mine.
Get the house on the left.
Get down. Get on the ground.
Get up.
-Put your hands behind your head.
-Get your hands up.
Shut the engine.
Get that motherfucker around the corner.
Hand the keys out.
Drop the keys out of the car.
Drop them now. Get out of the car.
Get down right here, right here.
Passenger, put your hands
out of the car window.
Both hands out of the car window.
Use your right hand, open up the car door.
Slowly. Step out of the car.
Down on the ground.
That's it, take his ass to jail.
-You got him, Carv?
-I got him.
-Look at this shit.
-Cross your legs.
Look at this.
You see what he did?
Do you see what he did?
Why he throw the gun on my car?
Shit gonna scratch the paint.
-Stay in the car.
-Tell him to leave my car be.
-Stay in the fucking car.
-That shit just ain't right.
Whatcha doing with something like that?
What you got here?
You should've seen
the way this bitch was looking at me, Kima.
Ugly little fucker almost shit his pants
he was so scared.
Right?
Two guns, remember?
-Two?
-It's all good, Kima, ease up.
All rise.
Part 1 2 of the Circuit Court
of Baltimore City is now in session.
Be seated.
Madame Forelady,
you have a unanimous verdict?
As to the defendant D'Angelo Barksdale...
how say you to the charge of murder
in the first degree?
Not guilty.
How say you to the charge of murder
in the second degree?
Not guilty.
Yeah.
-That's what I'm talking about.
-Be seated.
It's you, daddy, yeah, that's right.
-At least you made them work for it.
-Be seated.
The jury is to be thanked
for its services in this case.
Deputies will return
defendant Barksdale to pre-trial...
for processing prior to his release.
Think I give a fuck?
I'll be chalking you off one night.
-You have a nice day.
-Yo, Stringer, let's go.
Detective?
Detective. Judge asked to speak with you.
-What the hell happened out there?
-We lost.
Were you on this?
-The case?
-Yeah.
No, it was Barlow,
with an assist from McLarney.
If it was Barlow's case,
why are you in court?
No reason.
You just like coming to court
on murders you don't even work?
Just for the thrill of it?
When you start coming with the customers...
it's time to get out of the business.
You shouldn't talk dirty
now that you're a judge.
Now that I'm a judge,
I can say anything I damn please.
That Barksdale kid,
he's a cousin to Avon Barksdale.
-Who?
-Avon Barksdale, Stringer Bell.
The crew that's been running
Franklin Terrace for a year.
Stringer Bell?
That was him in court
with the legal pad and the glasses...
scaring the living shit out of every witness.
Him and the rest of his crew,
Wee-Bey, Savino, Stinkum.
-I saw them.
-You think about clearing the court?
On what basis?
It's an open court in a free nation of laws.
I thought it was Baltimore.
Barksdale has five out of seven towers
in the Terrace.
That's 10 stairwells in five high-rises,
going 24l7 for dope and coke.
And that's just the towers.
The low-rises,
the avenue corners, they're all his, too.
How do you know this?
-Everybody knows it.
-Define "everybody".
Everybody on the Westside.
Barksdale and Bell, they're the new power.
I mean, they've dropped
10 or 1 2 bodies in as many months.
Beat three cases in court
doing the same thing they just did.
-Who's working on them?
-In the department?
Nobody, really.
We're a little busy
doing street rips, you know.
Community policing and all that.
So, if it's not your case, why do you care?
Who said I did?
One more time.
Stop playing....
Fuck me.
You got submission numbers for the ECU?
-Nope.
-Get them.
-Why me?
-You want the collar, do the submissions.
-You giving me the start?
-It's your turn.
What's the extension for ECU?
Do I look like your bitch?
-We taking the Mercedes?
-No, I promised my girl.
Car's in her name.
Narcotics.
-Lieutenant. Line 2.
-Here you go.
-Fuck me, I cannot type.
-Who the fuck can?
Millennium been and gone...
and we still fucking around
with Smith-Corona.
We need to get them computers hooked up.
They promised to train us a year ago.
What would an ass-ignorant motherfucker
like you do with a computer?
-I don't know, trade stocks and shit.
-Jerk off, you mean.
We get them computers hooked up,
Herc'll be deep into some porn...
and Kima'll still be bangin' out
her 24s on that old piece of shit.
-Gotta go upstairs.
-What's up?
Deputy's throwing some kinda piss-fit.
-Major know?
-He's up there now.
With a mouthful of piss, probably.
Like our major don't know
what that tastes like?
It's the chain-of-command, baby,
the shit always rolls downhill.
-Motherfucker, we talking about piss.
-Piss does too, think about it.
-Shit rolls, piss trickles.
-Downhill, though.
You don't know that for sure--
Not to change the subject
on you two charmers...
but why are there only two ECU numbers?
-Dope and guns.
-Two guns, right?
-That's three.
-Fuck it, Kima.
You want a job done right,
you gotta do it your own self.
He means
that we are an effective deterrent...
on the war on drugs
when we are on the street.
-Fucking motherfuckers up, right?
-Indeed.
Fuck the paperwork.
-Collect bodies, split heads.
-Split them wide.
-The Western District way.
-All right.
You heroic motherfuckers kill me.
Fighting the war on drugs...
one brutality case at a time.
Girl, you can't even call this shit a war.
Why not?
Wars end.
You gonna write that down?
How happy am I to see my pager go off
with your call number?
Smoke 'em if you got 'em...
because this motherfucker
is as ripe as they get.
-We aren't up, Nolan's squad is up.
-I know.
But you had to answer the fucking phone.
-Got to pay down my credit cards.
-Not off him, you ain't.
I leave you alone for a minute,
what do you do?
-All right, I heard you.
-Say the words, Bunk.
-Come on, man.
-Speak to me.
So, you gonna cut and run on the Bunk?
That shit ain't right, Jimmy.
All right, then, this is my case. My file.
This shit comes back a murder...
you ain't gotta do shit
but stand there and laugh at me.
You happy now, you bitch?
This'll teach you to give a fuck
when it ain't your turn.
It ain't even gonna be a murder.
This motherfucker probably came in here
to take a shit and just fell out.
I bet there ain't nothing to it.
-You hope.
-Where you going?
Back to the office, where I belong.
You moldering motherfucker.
Don't even think
about coming back a murder.
Don't even think of that shit.
By tomorrow, Lieutenant. Don't fail me.
-Major's pissed.
-He should be.
He didn't have answers
for the deputy's questions.
-About what?
-Avon Barksdale.
Who?
-That's what I said.
-Who the fuck is Avon Barksdale?
According to the right honorable
Judge Phelan...
a Westside player who apparently indulges
in the occasional murder.
Now, as of today,
I never heard of Mr. Barksdale...
but by tomorrow....
All right, what do we know?
According to the judge,
he has the Westside high-rises.
The Terrace, mostly.
-Sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me.
-Maybe so.
-It's gotta be tonight?
-Major wants it filed by morning.
Call Andrews at DEA.
See what they have on this mope.
Call Andrews at DEA.
See what they have on this mope.
What about Homicide?
lf the guy's doing murders--
Homicide major was in the same meeting.
His people will be scrambling
to get something on paper, too.
I doubt they'll be willing to share,
but you can try.
Barksdale, Avon.
Got a DOB?
-Jay.
-Where the fuck you been all day?
Drinking, crack smoking.
Whoring myself on the streets of Baltimore.
Okay. Just so you have an excuse.
But your fuck of a partner
picked up the phone, caught a call.
-Yeah, I saw him out there.
-Yeah, what'd he get?
-Decomp in a vacant apartment.
-Fuck.
Nolan's squad was up,
that one should be theirs.
It's a decomp.
Maybe it comes back a natural death.
-You think?
-In the Poe Homes, no fucking way.
Hold up.
Major wants to talk to you
before you roll out.
-What about?
-Fuck should I know, I'm only your sergeant.
Sit the fuck down, Detective.
Something wrong?
Put your ass in the chair.
You see these, McNulty, you see them?
These are for you.
These are for you
for as long as it takes me to get even.
Major, what--
Don't "Major" me,
you backstabbing, smartass piece of shit.
What the fuck you doing
over at the courthouse anyway?
Why the fuck are you talking
to some shitbag judge?
These are for you, McNulty.
This one over here
is going up your narrow fucking lrish ass.
And this bad boy over here
is in your fucking eye.
I'm upstairs answering questions
about some project nigger I never heard of...
who's supposedly beat
my unit out of 10 murders.
Three. They only beat three in court.
I got the deputy asking about 10.
No, they did 10,
we only charged them with three.
-You're full of shit.
-Sir, you can check the files.
Maurice Scroggins,
Toreen Boyd, Roland Leggett.
The girl they found
in the stairwell in Saratoga...
Collette something or other.
I mean, Major, these guys are real.
They beat me up on the Gerard Bogue case
just like they did Barlow.
Scroggins? I don't have an H-file
on Scroggins.
He was last year, summer.
Two in the back of the head,
low-rise courtyard.
Let me understand something.
You are having the deputy
bust my balls over a prior-year case?
Is this what I need from you,
you insubordinate little fuck?
Major, look, I'm really sorry.
Phelan, he and l,
we go back a little, you know?
He wanted to know what I know
about the crew in his court.
I had to go upstairs knowing nothing...
and explain to the deputy why
he's getting calls about murders...
that don't mean a shit to anybody.
Look, sir, this judge, he fucks me up.
He asks me a question and I answer it.
I didn't know he was gonna call anybody.
You have my attention, Detective.
My complete, undivided attention.
-Yes, sir.
-Where you going?
-I'm 8:00-to-4:00.
-No.
-You're typing.
-Sir?
Deputy wants a report
on his desk at 0800.
-A report?
-Clean, no typos.
Make it look right, then put my name on it.
Do you want to reference all the murders?
Or should I soft-pedal that?
Fucking horse is out the barn door, right?
Let's try not to make me look stupid twice.
And when you list the cases,
put a little dot next to each one.
-Deputy likes dots.
-I'm sorry, Major, really.
Niggers crazy in there, yo.
Eastside, Westside, everybody beefing.
-You ain't got no problem, right?
-Hell no, we deep in there.
Y'all deep down at the courthouse, too.
Sitting there, I didn't know
what the fuck would happen.
I'm wondering...
how y'all gonna make it
happen for me, you know?
Slick what y'all did
with that security lady though.
That shit was tight, yo.
Let's walk.
-What's the rule?
-I know the rule.
Say it.
Don't talk in the car.
Or on the phone
or in any place that ain't ours.
Don't say shit to anybody who ain't us.
But it was just you.
It's your fucking truck.
Don't talk in the car.
What about Marcel?
No, I ain't inviting Marcel.
-You want him out?
-I really don't give a shit what you do.
Actually, no.
Go down there and make that motherfucker
pay for his drinks.
The bum.
-How you doing?
-What's up, Dee, good to see you.
What up, man?
Yo, you remember the cop
that tried to pin Gerard on little Kevin?
-Which one?
-White detective, black hair.
-The one that was knocking on all the doors.
-What about him?
He showed up in court to watch.
Word?
What are you talking
to that motherfucker for?
Damn, Dee.
He say anything?
No, just sat in the back.
-Yo, what up, money?
-What you got?
Come on, I got something for you.
-You must feel good.
-You know how that go.
-Say what?
-I'm saying, you know, jail ain't no joke.
I don't know shit about jail.
I don't plan on knowing shit
about jail, you feel me?
You wanna talk about jail though,
you can go sit down next to Marcel.
-He just got home.
-True, you right.
Sit your ass down.
I know it ain't go so good.
But that nigger, Pooh,
he caught me off guard.
-He came at me like he was crazy.
-So you shoot the motherfucker?
I'm saying, it was him or me.
You in our building.
You got people on both stairs.
You got more motherfucking people
out in the court.
And you got a gun.
So, what I'm trying to figure out is...
how the fuck you end up
shooting this nigger...
in front of the security booth
with all them people?
I'm saying, this nigger was coming at me...
-Iike he was trying to end me.
-This ain't about him.
It's about you.
You can't play him out of that lobby.
You can't take a beating neither.
So, the first thing you do,
you get all emotional...
you pull your gun out,
you do some dumb shit...
that now we got to work around.
I know.
You ain't said
one motherfucking thing I want to hear.
You right.
I mean, I gotta start thinking more.
You be saying that
all the time and you right.
But I'm saying though, I mean...
the shit y'all pulled with that security lady.
It was tight. I mean, that state lawyer.
I ain't never seen
a white woman turn so red.
You should've been there.
Yo, man, you family, okay?
But that shit cost money.
It cost time and money.
You gonna make that right?
Most def, you gonna see.
When I get back to the tower,
I'm gonna push them niggers.
All right.
Come here.
Don't walk out of here like that.
-You family, all right?
-All right.
-You know it's always love.
-Yeah.
Type quieter.
You didn't have to wait up, love.
Your boy have a heart attack?
No, I went that way...
but Doc Frazier didn't bite
when this popped up.
-You seriously fucked.
-Speaking of fucked, why are you here?
I did bad, Bunk. It wasn't my fault.
Really.
Judge Phelan pulled me up
when the jury let the Barksdale kid go.
Him being a judge and all,
I let go of some shit.
He raise a stink?
Major got busted by the Deputy Ops
and I gotta have a report by morning.
There you go, giving a fuck
when it ain't your turn to give a fuck.
Look at them, Cole.
Don't it make your dick bust concrete
to be in the same room...
with two noble, selfless public servants?
I know I'm proud.
Tell me you put this one down.
Of course not.
Of course your partner here
has to go over to the courthouse...
and lay our business out in front of a judge.
So, you heard?
Major calls me at home,
says I should get in early...
read over your shoulder.
It's got dots.
Deputy loves dots.
Fuck you and your dots.
All I did was answer the guy's questions.
He's a fucking judge.
And the Deputy's the fucking Deputy.
And he, not the judge...
has what's left of your beshitted career
in his hot little hands.
He says so...
you're walking foot
in the Western tomorrow.
-Fuck it, I came from Western.
-Where don't you want to go, asshole?
Evidence Control? Personnel?
-Headquarter Security?
-The boat.
The marine unit?
Yeah, those diesel fumes,
they make me feel seasick.
That's good, keep it up.
I'll go this against $10,
you're riding the boat, midnight shift.
Listen to the man, Jimmy.
Yo, Stringer.
-You here early.
-Yeah, I'm on my game today.
Eggy put out testers?
New deal today.
You going out on point,
picking up business in the Pit.
-What?
-You the man in the low-rises.
The low-rises?
You got Ronnie Mo in the Pit.
Ronnie Mo got 851 this morning.
Why you gonna put me in the low-rises
when I had a tower since summer?
Yeah, you had a tower.
And you might have a tower again
if you can keep your mind to shit.
This is fucked up.
You show us you can run the Pit,
and you'll be back uptown soon enough.
My uncle know about this?
What do you think?
-Yo, Bey.
-Yo.
Give little cousin here a ride down the way.
-Have your people deal with Daniels.
-Right.
You gonna send your man McNulty?
Tell him about chain-of-command.
Tell him yourself, he's dead to me.
-Yo, you looking for Ronnie Mo, he uptown.
-I know.
You Dee, right?
-Wasn't you in the towers?
-Yeah.
Why they put you down here, yo?
You mess with the count or something?
I killed a nigger.
Last call on green top, last call.
Major?
Counting what we got from the DEA,
how much do we have on this guy?
Lieutenant, in my hand,
I'm holding how many pages?
-Four, sir.
-Rawls had a fucking phone book.
What can I tell you,
they got 10 open murder files.
If we had 10 shots at him,
we'd have more than a fat file.
I said that upstairs.
They can't put this guy down for a murder...
-so they're getting us to do their work.
-Not getting us, they got us.
They got you, in fact.
Excuse me, sir?
Dawson has the York and Cator case,
that leaves you.
Shit. Look, set something up
with Homicide...
and whoever else
you want from your squads.
-State's Attorney?
-Yeah, we should call them, too.
Fucking shitstorm.
Lieutenant, line 3.
Deputy Ops.
Here we go.
Close that for me.
What's the coffee do?
Give it that money feel,
so it don't seem so white.
Yeah.
Leastways, you got it
on both sides this time.
All right, give me the real.
Wait, why are we gonna use real money?
We're not burning
no lemon street chumps here.
Feel me?
I'm down.
You down? Johnny's down.
-You got that gig.
-Can I get a one-on-one?
Yo, Poot.
Yo, Wallace.
This the way Ronnie Mo set it up?
-Yeah.
-Man, this is fucked up.
Look, you can't serve
your customers straight up...
after taking they money.
Somebody snapping pictures,
they got the whole damn thing.
See what I'm saying? You get paid...
you send they ass off
around the building, yo.
Then you serve. All right?
We gotta start tightening up, man.
No more shortcuts.
-What's your count?
-I'm up $270.
You want to count it.
I mean, I don't know how
you do shit up in the towers.
-But down here, you want to count it.
-Shit.
Y'all niggers been burnt.
That's what you got to say?
This look like money, motherfucker?
Money be green. Money feel like money.
-That shit look green to you?
-It got a dead fucking president on it.
I don't give a fuck about the president.
-That shit ain't money.
-He ain't no president.
-What you mean?
-Hamilton.
-He ain't no president.
-Nigger, is you crazy?
Ain't no ugly-ass white man
get his face on no legal...
motherfucking tender except he president.
This shit happen again, you off the money.
You hear me?
You ain't even gonna be serving no more.
Your ass be out
on the bottom end of Vine street...
sucking on a 40, yelling "5-0".
You hear me?
Get the fuck out of here.
That it?
No.
You need to pace that shit, man.
-Johnny, man, you hear me?
-I'm cool.
No, man, you gonna fall out...
slamming that shit like that
one of these days, boy.
Yo, man, I'm trying
to give you a little game, man...
but you want to pretend
like you know something.
I know a lot, Bubbs.
No, you green.
I'm trying to get you brown, man...
but you still green.
You gonna make me brown?
Yo, Bubbs?
Let me do the scam tomorrow.
Come on, man, I'm ready.
Yo, I'm brown.
Shit, man, you ain't even fucking beige.
-Buy-busts.
-Yes, sir.
No long surveillances,
no Kel recorders, no DNRs.
I want to get in and out
as quickly as possible.
That makes sense.
Phelan isn't just a judge,
he's a political entity.
If he asks for something,
I want to give it to him.
Why is he asking about this Barksdale?
He watched his state's attorney
get beat up in his court this week.
-Lost a murder case.
-We lose cases all the time.
But a judge happens
to be asking about this one.
-Who you using?
-Lead detective?
-Greggs, she's my best right now.
-I know her?
CID for four months.
Came over from Eastern DEU.
-Who's Homicide sending?
-That's up to Major Rawls.
I wouldn't be surprised if you get McNulty.
-You know McNulty?
-Not really.
He's the one who mouthed off
to the judge in the first place.
-He talked to the judge?
-Yeah, that's my understanding.
So, if he comes over on this,
watch your back.
You need anything, you ask me.
I'll give you all the help I can.
-But no surprises.
-Yes, sir.
Keep me briefed.
-Hi, McNulty, City Homicide.
-Is anyone expecting you?
Yeah, Special Agent Fitzhugh, Squad 5.
He's expecting me, can l--
-Not without an escort.
-All right.
Agent Fitzhugh to the front.
-Fitz.
-Brother.
-She can spot a bad one.
-Nothing personal, Jimmy.
You know how they are
with security nowadays.
I know how they are with locals, yeah.
So, what's up, g-man?
-Good stuff.
-Yeah?
Your man gave us a hell of a case.
Comes to informants, Jimmy,
you can pick 'em.
He's one of the better Cl's I've ever worked.
-You up on a wire?
-That and more.
So, like, he be talking like
he got some type of record deal, you know?
-Man, please.
-That nigger.
-The pussy has you.
-Jesus Christ.
-Pretty fucking great, huh?
-How'd you get this on tape?
That's not tape. That's live, brother.
That's live?
Live from a three-story walkup
on Homer Avenue...
in the bottoms of Pimlico.
This is going on right now?
-As we speak.
-How?
Fiber-optic lensing.
Camera's behind a hole in the drywall.
So small it looks like
a nail might've made it.
Where's the mic?
These motherfuckers sound great.
Two remotes behind
the baseboard heating ducts.
That's about $3,000 of raw
on the table today.
We followed it all the way from New York.
You're up in New York on this?
We could be.
We're backing into
some Dominicans up there.
We could have a Title Ill
on them right now if we wanted.
We could have a Title Ill
on them right now if we wanted.
Wrong war, brother.
Most of the squad's been transferred
to counterterrorism.
This thing's the last drug case
we got pending...
and I gotta shut it down
by the end of the month.
-You guys are getting out of drugs?
-Yeah, for a while.
We just don't have the manpower
to stay on anything big.
Not since those towers fell.
What, we don't have enough love
in our hearts for two wars?
-Joke's on us, huh?
-I guess so.
Still and all, you give great case, brother.
I wish you could've worked it with us.
Got some Tech Nine over here,
over here, Tech Nine.
That's it, here's $20, hook it up.
Two and two.
-Hold up.
-What?
-Just two and two.
-Come on, man, I ain't got time for this.
-I gave you $20, man.
-You gave me $20?
One and a short three.
-So you get, two--
-$7.
-Hold up.
-I get $7 back. Come on, man.
Calm down.
Hold up, hold up, you fucking me up.
Chill out.
You dropping shit on the ground?
-Hold up.
-I ain't got all day.
Come on, man, it's easy. Let's rewind, man.
What the fuck is you doing?
Look at this shit. Look, nigger.
That's the motherfucker right there.
-Who?
-The white boy right there.
Poot, grab that motherfucker.
The white boy.
Hold up, man.
Stop that white motherfucker.
Yeah, motherfucker, yeah, nigger. Fuck that.
What are you doing, man?
Calm down, man.
Making me run,
what the fuck is wrong with you?
-What, man, why you fucking with me?
-Shit.
This the motherfucker right here
with the make-believe money.
Seen his ass drop it and shit.
-Wasn't me.
-Motherfucker.
It was this nigger, I saw him.
Get the fuck up.
All right, listen, I'm sorry.
Fuck that.
What we need to do is,
motherfucker burned us for $30.
We need to take him to Franklin Ave...
and throw his ass right
onto the motherfucking expressway.
All right, listen, I'm fucking sorry.
I fucked up, man.
-What you got on you?
-Just the $10 I dropped, man, the real one.
What's up?
Fuck it.
Hell, yeah.
For now, we'll work out of Narcotics,
with Kima keeping the file.
We'll copy everything to Ronnie
at the courthouse and your people.
Fine with us.
McNulty and Santangelo will work
on the open murders...
see if anything can be manufactured.
Kima and my people will do
hand-to-hand stuff in the Terrace.
Buy-bust, quick and dirty.
We put years over top of
some of these people, we'll roll a few.
You're not gonna get
Avon Barksdale or Stringer Bell...
or anyone else above the street,
not on street rips.
-You don't know that.
-These guys are good.
They're deep and organized.
They've got everyone running scared.
What do you suggest?
Surveillance teams,
DNRs, asset investigation.
Keep gathering string
till we can find a way in.
Either a wired CI or a Title Ill.
That's what makes this case.
Is that what you told the judge?
Okay, so I'm an asshole for that.
But I'm right about this much.
No mics, no wires.
We do this fast and clean and simple.
Then you don't do it at all.
Seems to me you all could've had this fight
before calling the State's Attorney's office.
Let me ask you something.
What do we know about Avon Barksdale?
What do we know?
The guy's owned
all of Franklin Terrace for a year.
What do we have on him right now?
A DOB? A sheet?
A B of I photo?
We don't even have
a fucking photo of the guy.
Gimme a break, Jimmy.
Two days ago no one on this fucking floor
knew this mope's name.
Now he's some kinda criminal mastermind.
Shit, I say we go down to the Terrace
and fuck some people up.
You all don't need a prosecutor,
you need a fucking referee.
When you know how
you're playing this, give a yell.
We know how we're playing it.
My people are going down
to do some hand-to-hands.
Detectives McNulty and Santangelo are
going to the hall to review old murder files...
and try to manufacture a fresh prosecution.
As things heat up, I'll go to the deputy
and get us more manpower...
but this case is not going to sprawl.
A month from now,
we're all gonna be back at our day jobs.
Fine. Bring me your hand-to-hands.
Anything on the murders, you can take
to llene Nathan in violent crimes.
I'll clue her in.
Anything else?
One last thing:
No one does anything at all on the street
without me knowing about it first.
Chain-of-command, Detective.
That's how we do things
down this end of the hall.
If she's fucking you on visitation,
take her ass to court.
Not that simple, Bunk.
Judge gives me three weekends out of four,
I still need her to cooperate.
You know, move it around...
so when I have to work through a weekend,
she switches with me.
The judge gives me
three weekends but no flex...
I still lose.
-You two can't talk this through?
-No.
How is it you always got
the whole world pissed off at you?
You know Daniels? Narcotics?
-What about him?
-He's running this detail.
-Watch your ass then.
-He a snake?
No, he ain't that. But he's a company man.
You know, a prospect.
Grapevine says the next district
to open up is his.
Shortlist for major?
He's black, he's still young,
he hasn't pissed anybody off.
-Shit, he even has a law degree.
-No shit.
-University of Baltimore, but still, you know.
-He's gonna fuck this Barksdale thing up.
-How's that?
-Buy-bust?
-He's pissing in the wind.
-You already fucked it up, Jimmy.
You made it happen.
I feel like that motherfucker
at the end of Bridge On The River Kwai.
-What the fuck did I do?
-The bridge of what?
You ain't seen that movie?
I am fucked.
Fucked is me.
God damn it, you gonna make me
go another round.
Two more.
-It's all in the game.
-I'm saying it was only a couple dollars.
-It ain't the money.
-But we fucked him up so bad.
It's the message, Dee.
You can't show no weakness.
-Still, I'm saying.
-What?
String.
You ain't touched that drink.
You want some company?
-I ain't no john.
-Good, 'cause I ain't no whore.
I'm not a regular, okay?
-I work for Stringer.
-He pay you, don't he?
Come on, buy me a drink.
-How much?
-$20.
I drink slow.
Maybe another time.
-Buy me a drink, honey?
-How about you buy me a drink?
Carla. One here.
-Where you at?
-Where you think?
-You late for work?
-A little.
-How much you got left?
-Girl, please.
-Ten pages and all the footnotes.
-When's it due?
Tomorrow, beginning of class.
Long night for you.
Long night for me.
I'll make sure and pick up some coffee.
So, I drive all the way down
to Liberty Road...
at 2:00 in the damn morning,
on a midnight shift...
I got two murders and a police shooting
going down, to do what?
To get a goddamn mouse
out of my wife's bedroom closet.
Can you imagine that shit?
So what did you do?
What the fuck you think?
I got the mouse out as fast as I could
and drove back to work.
Couldn't do nothing else.
Nadine out of her fucking mind
over this little-ass field mouse.
She's up on the chair and shit
when I come...
Iike some goddamn cartoon.
-I mean, how'd you catch the mouse?
-Catch him? I lit his ass up.
You shot the mouse?
With your nine?
First shot killed my wife's dress shoe.
Got him with the second.
What?
You shot a mouse
with your service weapon?
Yeah.
What'd you do with the carcass?
I cleaned it up, you know.
I thought about leaving
that little motherfucker...
as a warning to the others.
Fuck me.
It's 3:30 in the morning.
I'm supposed to be early relief.
Jimmy, man,
I gotta change my clothes at least, come on.
I'm gonna do this case.
What?
I'm gonna do this case
the way it should be done.
It's a buy-bust, Jimmy, get in and get out.
-Fuck that.
-Jimmy.
Let's call it a night.
Hi, Bubbs.
Thought you was still locked up.
Nope.
How long you been home?
It's been three months.
You don't write, you don't call.
Who's he?
A friend.
Is he gonna make it?
You still working drugs?
Downtown, yeah.
I got something for you.
-Last call.
-Fuck.
Found body. 200, Block Amity.
I'm a little thin today, boss.
The whole squad's a little thin, remember?
We're down a man
since your partner got himself detailed.
Yeah.
I got it.
Jesus.
-How you doing, Bobby?
-Bunk, what's going on, man?
We got one or two shots to the head.
No witnesses, no suspects.
You got a .380 casing on the ground there.
Buddy, do me a favor, bag that for me?
So, who called it in?
No one. 21 Post found him.
It's a William Gant, 42, no, 43 years old...
address on Schroeder.
-You got pictures?
-Yeah, we got them.
Okay, let's roll him.
Mr. Gant, do you see the man
you identified...
sitting in the courtroom today?
He's right there.
That's the witness all right,
the one from the Barksdale case.
Gant, William. 41 years.
Single headshot, close range.
Bullet pancaked on the inner skull.
-Ain't necessarily what it looks like.
-No?
A man's walking down a street
in West Baltimore.
That'll catch you a bullet
for a half-dozen reasons.
-Yeah, that it will.
-You run him for a sheet?
Yeah, a couple of disorderlies is all.
Guy works maintenance
down at Poe Homes.
Lives alone, no wife, no kids.
Only time his name pops up
on the courthouse computer...
is for being a state witness in Barlow's case.
Otherwise,
I don't even make that connection.
I mean, you've got to admit...
it don't make sense to ace this motherfucker
after he done testified.
Sends a hell of a message though.
He's one hardheaded fuck in the Terrace
you can't run off or buy out, right?
If your audience is the high-rise projects,
a move like this cuts right through the shit.
What are you gonna tell the major?
That I caught a stone fucking whodunit.
-Don't soft-sell the witness angle.
-Come on.
Why get the bosses riled
before we know for sure?
If I start talking shit
that a witness got killed--
-Bunk, tell him.
-Why?
Just cover yourself on this.
Jimmy, you ain't gonna do what I think?
Listen to me.
This shit is gonna jump up
and bite you in your ass.
Just cover yourself.
-What the hell was that about?
-Nothing.
Morning.
Jesus Christ.
Goddamn.
Who do you got to fuck in this town
to get a real office?
At least that works.
It was for McNulty.
-I shouldn't be here.
-Then you shouldn't.
They killed a fucking witness
out of your court.
Yeah, you told me. You did your civic duty.
Under the power vested in me
by the circuit court for Baltimore city...
I absolve you of all your sins,
Detective McNulty.
You are my sin, you know that?
For talking to you,
my major is ready to cut my throat.
Jimmy, you knew I was gonna
make that call. Admit it.
I didn't think you would straight-up
hang me out on the line in a shitstorm.
Look, it's not like it was
when I was a prosecutor.
-I'm a judge now, the rules are different.
-You missed a spot.
Yeah, what's done is done.
Question is,
what do you want me to do now?
I think you can leverage the Deputy Ops
with a phone call.
-He's already detailed people.
-Some detail.
Asshole lieutenant thinks
he can buy-bust his way to Avon Barksdale.
You want leverage?
We give the dead-witness angle
to the newspapers.
Stir some real shit.
No, that tips Barksdale
that someone's working him.
-We don't want to go public.
-No?
Just put it to the Deputy Ops...
you lost a witness
who testified in your court.
That forces the department
to commit to the investigation.
And when you call Burrell this time,
will you forget my fucking name?
-You missed a spot.
-Why don't you fucking do it?
Seniority.
-You found us.
-Wasn't easy.
-You asked for these guys?
-I asked for more manpower.
Have a seat.
What the fuck....
Sir, l--
He was showing me
the trigger pull on his Glock.
-And he was just--
-Detective?
Officer Pryzbylewski shot the wall,
Lieutenant.
Why?
Why did you shoot the wall,
Officer Pryzbylewski?
I was just showing Carv
how my trigger pull is light, you know.
-I got it so it's real light.
-He took the clip out, boss.
But not the one in the chamber.
No, I forgot the one in the chamber, and....
Shit, I'm sorry, lieutenant.
-You want him to write on it?
-Write on what?
You let one go, you got to write.
You got to justify the use of deadly force.
Against a plaster wall.
It's an accident, okay?
Give me a fucking break already.
-Your name is what?
-Pryzbylewski.
From Auto Unit, right? Cantrell sent you.
Not exactly.
Lt. Cantrell sent me
to Casualty Section a couple months back.
And I asked out of Casualty.
You came here from Casualty Section?
Man, these shits is right, yo.
-It's good with the hot sauce, too.
-Most definite.
-Dee, want some nuggets?
-No, go ahead, man.
Man, whoever invented these,
he off the hook.
Word!
Motherfucker got the bone
all the way out the damn chicken.
Till he came along,
niggas be chewing on drumsticks and shit...
getting their fingers all greasy.
He said "Later" to the bone.
Nugget that meat up
and make some real money.
-You think the man got paid?
-Who?
-Man who invented these.
-Shit, he richer than a motherfucker.
Why? You think he get a percentage?
Why not?
Nigga, please, the man
who invented them things...
just some sad-ass down
at the basement of McDonald's...
thinking up some shit
to make money for the real players.
-No man, that ain't right.
-Fuck right.
It ain't about right, it's about money.
You think Ronald McDonald
gonna go down that basement...
and say, "Mr. Nugget, you the bomb.
"We selling chicken faster
than you can tear the bone out.
"So, I'm gonna write my clowny-ass name
on this fat-ass check for you."
Shit.
The nigger who invented them things...
still working in the basement
for regular wage...
thinking of some shit
to make the fries taste better.
Believe.
He still had the idea, though.
Who?
Polk and Pat Mahone.
A couple of drunks from Property.
-I don't know them.
-Why would you?
They haven't made a case in 10 years.
Also got handed some kid
named Prezbelowski or Prezbelewski--
-Pryzbylewski, him, I know.
-Yeah?
-Why was he in Casualty Section?
-He shot up his own car.
-You remember?
-He did what?
He fired two clips into an unmarked car,
somewhere out in West Baltimore.
Called in a Signal 13 on the radio,
like he was under fire from a sniper.
You didn't hear about that?
He stuck to his story for half a day,
until Ballistics matched the bullet...
to his off-duty weapon.
-We almost indicted him for false report.
-Why didn't you?
He's got some kind of suction
with the Mayor's office. I'm not sure.
My point is, I can't build much
with the garbage they sent me.
So, go to the deputy, right?
You've got his ear on this.
Why not?
I ask the deputy for manpower.
He then tells Property to send me two men,
and Special to send two more.
And those shift lieutenants...
they know it's a chance
to dump their deadwood.
The deputy, he knows this, too.
He could have offered
to let me pick but he didn't.
-He sent me a message on this.
-And the message is?
Don't dig in, don't get fancy.
Put a quick charge on this Barksdale
and then get out.
If he sends me good police,
I might do good police work.
-But if the state's attorney's office were to--
-No, no.
Rhonda, darling...
it's bad protocol for me to ask for help
and then trash the help I'm given.
-You, on the other hand--
-No way.
My office doesn't play that way.
You people staff your cases,
you bring us casework.
I cross that line, I only piss everyone off.
Best I can do is tell my unit chief
that you drew shit.
He wants to take it upstairs...
call the deputy for operations,
that's his choice.
-That won't happen.
-Probably not.
Make lemonade.
Fuck!
Yo, Kima, where you taking us?
-Get down.
-What?
Jesus. You all ain't got no creep to you.
Pair of goddamn elephants.
A rusted nail just went through my shoe.
I'm gonna need a tetanus
to get behind this bullshit.
-Kima.
-Hand me that bag.
Kima, if you don't mind me asking...
when was it that you first figured
you liked women better than men?
I mind you asking.
Gentlemen, what's going on there, guys?
-Testers, man, already out.
-No.
I'm not in need of your services, bro.
I'm offering my services to y'all.
What you got in the bag, man?
One thing a gentleman of color like better
than a new pair of downtown shoes...
is a downtown brim, right?
What's with the hats?
-Five-o!
-Five-o!
Shut it down!
Clean?
You ain't gonna put that one on me.
He a witness.
You picked that shit up off the ground,
so don't be trying to put shit on me.
Is that what you think I'm about?
Boy thinks I'm gonna dirty him.
Like y'all won't do it.
You Western knockos come here,
picking shit up off the ground...
putting it on whoever you damn well please.
Do I know you?
Let's understand each other.
I'm not Western District.
I'm not a knocko. I don't dirty people...
because I don't care
about a possession charge.
I'm a Murder Police,
I'm here about the bodies.
D'Angelo here knows that.
He remembers me from the trial, right?
I'm sitting in back there, behind Stringer,
watching, listening.
Y'all hassling me about that shit?
I thought you heard
what the jury had to say.
-Fuck the jury.
-Yeah, fuck the jury.
This is just us talking, right?
Just you, me, my partner and....
What did you say your name was?
I didn't say shit.
Just you, me, my partner and Mr. Shit here.
We're just talking
about how things go, right?
We are just sharing our thoughts here.
-Bunk, a vial for your thoughts.
-I'm thinking it's one thing for one of you...
Iittle Terrace niggers
to shoot somebody in the lobby...
of the 221 building, you know?
Who gives a fuck?
-But when you ace a witness...
-A working man.
...who ain't even in the game....
You gonna act like this is news?
I tell you this, I don't know shit about shit,
but I do know this...
anyone who spend time witnessing shit,
you gonna get got.
I know that sounds kind of harsh,
but that's the way things go around here...
officer.
Let's roll.
That how you see things, D'Angelo?
Like your friend here?
I'm here trying to outfit niggers
with something to rile up some pussy.
You don't want to know,
Bubbles used to get that pussy.
I reckon the pussy ain't worth
what it used to be...
if you can do it without
a proper brim, right?
Come on, big man.
-Something's up.
-What?
Don't know.
Yo, Carv. Come here.
Listen, you see Bubbs
put a hat on anybody...
you take some pictures, all right?
-Yeah?
-Especially the red one.
If you see him put that red hat
on anybody's head...
snap your fucking fingers off.
Where you going?
Yo, Carv. Notice that most of the time...
it's like Kima thinks
she's above us or something?
I mean, I don't see any stripes
on her fucking sleeve...
I don't see that.
All I see is some stuck-up dyke bitch...
who ain't been in CID
half the time of you or me...
and she's fucking telling us what to do.
It ain't right. You think it's right?
Shut up for just a minute.
I'm trying to concentrate on this shit here.
Nice truck.
No? Makes your breath minty fresh.
Is you all gonna arrest me?
Then go the fuck ahead and arrest me.
If not, shut the fuck up.
-You want to get arrested?
-No.
-Shut the fuck up your own self.
-I'm out of here.
Hey, D'Angelo.
You better bend the fuck over.
Shit.
-You ain't got nothing else to do today?
-No, no, nothing.
Y'all ain't got no charge.
You're getting awfully close, man.
You new on the force or some shit?
All right, Dee.
Move it.
It's Greggs. Get me the lieutenant.
Prez? He's no good to anyone, he's a goof.
How is he my problem then?
How is he still carrying a gun and badge?
You know Valchek in Southeast?
-Yeah.
-Son-in-law.
I can't carry him on this.
You know who Special sent me?
-Who?
-Polk and Mahoney.
Between the two of them
I don't have a designated driver.
I heard you have someone from Pawnshop.
Lester Freamon? A cuddly housecat.
I don't think he can even find his gun.
Look, take Pryzbylewski back.
You know I can't. I would, but I can't.
I gave Valchek my word on it, okay?
I can't help it that Prez
is fucking the guy's daughter.
-If not for that, he's gone, no question.
-So, you got suction with Valchek?
If I cross him,
I'm fucked on the next round of promotions.
For Christ's sake,
I'm with you on the short list for major.
Valchek has suction
with the First District Democratic Club...
and they got suction with the Mayor,
and I'm the runt without a tit here.
I owe you, okay?
-So, give me Sydnor.
-No way.
Give me Sydnor and I'll keep Prez.
He's my best man, you can't take him.
-I'm taking your worst, remember?
-How about Steinman?
I'm working drugs in West Baltimore,
I need a black guy for surveillance.
I need Sydnor.
-Jesus, know what Prez did this morning?
-Tell me.
He put a bullet through a wall,
dry-firing in the detail office.
Look, no promises.
You give me Sydnor,
I'll carry Pryzbylewski as long as I can.
Fine, Cedric, fuck, whatever. Jesus Christ.
How did you handle the judge?
I told him we were looking
closely at the situation.
I asked him not to say anything publicly.
So, then he's not gonna go public, right?
Judge Phelan called this morning...
crying about a witness
in his murder trial who was killed.
Did the judge say where he heard it?
He heard it from our man, McNulty.
That's his pipeline on this crap.
Pardon my French, but I got no problem
giving that asshole up at this point.
-I don't need people I can't trust.
-Yeah, who does?
The newspapers get hold of this,
it'll be a complete clusterfuck.
Okay, so the thing to do
is reassure the judge...
keep him off his damn soapbox.
An arrest or two would help.
What if it's true?
What if Barksdale ordered the murder
of a state's witness?
Are you serious?
Why would anyone do that
after the witness testifies?
-It has no effect on the case.
-Payback, plain and simple.
Bullshit, plain and simple.
Look, I know there could be
two dozen other reasons...
for this man to be murdered, but what if--
No money for pretrial.
No witness protection program.
Look, this is a poor fucking city, gentlemen.
The last thing we ever need to do
is to announce we lost a witness.
I mean, it's hard enough
pushing felony casework...
through that courthouse as it is.
-You got to pull McNulty off this.
-Who caught the murder case?
-Bunk Moreland, McNulty's partner.
-Then you'd have to pull him, too.
No, we pull McNulty up,
the judge will bring the press into this.
I can see that a mile away.
No, we're gonna sit tight,
let McNulty take his best shot...
and hope like hell he comes up short.
How do you wanna handle this?
We got nothing on him.
We try to front, he'll see right through us.
He's scared though. Soft.
Go with the deuce?
Hold up, hold up.
-He part of my case?
-No, sir.
He's a potential suspect in my murder.
Which might be part of my case.
I could use some coffee.
You want some coffee?
-I need a word with you.
-We're just about to go--
Now.
You remember all that bullshit I gave you
about keeping me informed...
about nothing happening
that I don't know about?
-Lieutenant--
-Wasn't bullshit.
My partner caught a murder.
It may have nothing with Barksdale at all.
I just came from Deputy Ops' office...
where your own major's
telling Burrell to do you.
You hear me? Rawls is giving you up.
-What the fuck did I do?
-You can't shut your mouth.
You think that downtown judge
is gonna bail your ass out on this?
You really think that?
You should have come to me.
We bring this business to the deputy first,
we got a shot.
But no, you're out there all alone,
jumping bad.
-You got the deputy's ear?
-On this case, I do.
Then how come they sent
every worthless hump in plainclothes?
You ask for men,
they send you drunks and fuck-ups.
I want to do this case.
So do l.
Then you're gonna get
all the way in, Lieutenant.
If I see you get all the way in,
then I know who you are, what you're about.
-Who is he?
-D'Angelo Barksdale.
-Nephew to the king.
-That's the one that beat the murder?
Yeah, him.
What do you have
to connect him to the dead witness?
-Not a thing.
-Why did you pick him up?
Press him. See what kind of flex he shows.
-She goes in with you.
-We don't need her.
Bunk and me, we got our own rhythm.
You want me in, McNulty?
I thought you said you wanted me in.
You're along for this interview,
but it's Homicide's play, so let him lead.
You might want to run
tag and title on these two trucks.
-They scoped us when we jacked the kid.
-Been there.
Info's already in the file.
Y'all weren't the only lawmen
down in the Canyon today.
-Really, where were you?
-Where was she?
I mean, the thing is,
I can't see a reason for that man to be dead.
I can't. I mean, hell, you beat us in court.
-We don't take it personal.
-Fuck, no.
We get paid either way.
And it's not like you did anything real bad...
throwing a couple of hot ones
at Pooh Blanchard.
No one's gonna miss that motherfucker.
But you know the man
who got killed this time?
You know who that
poor son of a bitch was?
A citizen.
Worked every goddamn day of his life.
You know that?
He would get up every day,
go out and do maintenance work.
Then on the weekends,
he was driving a cab out to the airport.
Two jobs.
And he volunteers what little time
he has left at his church.
-Church-going man.
-A bethel man, a deacon.
Two jobs and three kids.
Did you know that?
Three kids. Young, too.
Five, eight, eleven.
Crying their little orphaned asses to sleep...
'cause they lost their mama
some years ago...
and now they out there on their own.
-He doesn't believe us.
-I know he don't believe it.
We've been here two hours,
telling you what's true in the world...
and you sit like nothing happened.
Where my lawyer at?
We called him.
When he comes, we'll let you know.
I got nothing to say.
I mean, I'm sorry for the man,
but I ain't got nothing to say.
You sorry? You sorry for him?
You fucking killed the man.
-No.
-Yes, you did.
We don't think that you shot him,
but if you weren't so busy...
Iighting folks up in high-rise lobby...
he ain't coming out of the elevator
and see it happen.
He don't see anything, he doesn't testify.
He doesn't testify,
those kids still got a daddy to lean on.
-Why'd he testify?
-How would we know?
-He didn't have to testify.
-No, he didn't, but he did.
And you still beat the charge, didn't you?
But that wasn't enough.
It's not enough to beat the murder.
They gotta send a cold message
to everyone in the Terrace.
Fuck the working man.
Fuck his kids, that shit don't count.
See, that's what I don't get
about the drug thing.
Why can't you sell the shit
and walk the fuck away?
You know what I mean?
Everything else in this country gets sold...
without people shooting each other
behind it.
In the Terrace, it's one body after another.
You remember that little boy...
got shot in the barbershop
on West Lombard last summer?
One asshole chases another into a house...
empties a 9.
Bullshit argument over 20 missing gelcaps...
and that little kid,
instead of getting his first haircut...
he gets one in the eye.
You remember that?
-It's fucked up.
-Yes, it is.
-It's fucked up.
-Yes, it is.
They didn't have to do that.
Shoot up a barber shop?
No, they did not have to do that.
That man was just...
my thing.
My thing, they ain't had....
They ain't had to do that.
No mama and no daddy.
Lord Jesus!
I'll tell you what I think
you should do, D'Angelo...
not because I think you wanted that man
to get shot...
or had anything to do with shooting him.
But I think you could just sit here...
for a moment or two,
collect your thoughts...
you know, get your shit together.
And then I think it might be a good thing...
for you to write a little letter
to those children...
and you let them know you're sorry...
that they're not gonna
have anyone left, you know?
I mean, just say something.
Tell them how you personally
think your uncle...
maybe he got it wrong this time,
because it's wrong...
that they lost their daddy
behind what happened, you know?
It might mean something to them to know
that you're feeling for them.
Man, I ain't got nothing to say.
Just say what's in your heart.
Church deacon? That was thick.
Got good to me, what can I say?
It's sad enough with the kids
being orphaned and everything.
Photo was from Bunk's desk.
-They're yours?
-Yeah, afraid so.
Good thing they look like their mama.
Maurice Levy just posted.
He's by the elevators.
-The defense never rests.
-Shame on you, McNulty.
Dragging me from the Levy family preserve
on a Friday night.
-My apologies.
-Yvette made brisket.
-Good?
-When served hot. One or two?
Your client.
What the fuck! Stop writing! Now!
-I'm just--
-Shut up!
He calls his lawyer, that's supposed to be
the end of the interview.
Your client gave no statement,
we took no statement.
He just decided, voluntarily,
to write a letter to the victim's family.
-To say that--
-Shut up!
-Any charge here?
-No charge.
Good, get up. Go! Walk!
Listen to me, you don't say anything...
you don't do anything,
you don't write anything.
Do you hear me?
Shut up!
How many times do I have to tell you people
the same fucking thing?
What the fuck is that?
Armoire. Louis Quatorze.
I mean, what is it, a toy?
Some of you I know.
Some of you I will know.
If you've ever worked with me before,
you know I don't want cowboy shit...
and I don't want surprises.
The task...
is Avon Barksdale,
and Avon Barksdale only.
No sidetrips, no sprawl.
Primary investigators
are Greggs from my unit and--
Greggs from my unit
and McNulty from Homicide.
They keep the file.
On the street, we work partners.
Greggs and Sydnor. Herc and Carver.
McNulty's with Santangelo,
Mahone and Polk.
Pryzbylewski and Freamon.
To start with, we got nine--
How's that? Did that get it?
What? Do you hear me?
What?
To start with, we have
nine or ten open homicide files...
to work back through for leads.
McNulty and Santangelo,
they're on that already.
Herc, Carver, Sydnor, and me,
we'll be targeting street dealers...
and rolling them back up
at Barksdale's people.
Polk and Mahone are available
to run down specific leads.
Freamon, Pryzbylewski,
are gonna start in-office...
on clerical duty.
-You need a prosecutor--
-No, turn the shit off!
What?
You need a prosecutor.
Rhonda Pearlman from Narcotics
is assigned.
Now, we don't have enough desks yet,
so we gotta share--
-Y'all from Purchasing?
-No.
Like I was saying, we've been promised
some computers...
and surveillance equipment.
-Questions?
-Yeah, who signs the overtime slips?
No OT, unless prior authorization.
A case goes from red to black
by way of green, Lieutenant.
You people bring me
something that needs OT...
you'll get OT...
until then, live on your fucking salaries.
"I'm very sorry for your father.
If I could've stopped it, I would have."
What can you do with this?
Nothing legally.
He doesn't put himself in,
or anyone else for that matter.
You can't read that letter...
and think that man was killed
for any other reason...
than he was a witness.
Why apologize at all
if you got nothing to do with it?
We lost a state's witness.
Even in Baltimore,
that's supposed to mean something, right?
Just go to the deputy,
show him what's what...
and let's put something real together.
This case needs informants.
It needs long-term surveillance.
And eventually,
it's gonna need a Title 3 wiretap.
Most of all, it needs police who know
how to work those things.
You think it's good for business
to put it out on the street...
that our witnesses get killed?
You think it's not on the street already?
No grandstanding, no red balls.
Like I said, we get in and out.
Aunt June.
Yeah, I hope you're hungry.
Starving.
Hey, Dee!
What's up, baby?
-That your uncle?
-Yeah.
I thought he'd look different.
My man, Dee. What's up, man?
This the little man?
Yo, you see how shorty
favor your nephew here?
What's up, little man?
You ain't gonna be able to deny that child.
You wanna come to me?
I know you tryin' to come to me.
-Been napping.
-Yeah?
Just woke up.
You got a grip, let me see your grip.
C'mon, give us a twirl, let's take a look.
What you looking at?
-Go fix her a hot plate.
-All right.
Put everything on it.
She's the skinniest thing in here.
Come on, girl, we gonna hook you up.
Don't let that fool you, she can eat, man.
-How y'all doing? You doing good?
-Yeah, we all right.
She want me to move in,
I'm thinking about it.
Let's walk.
Let's walk.
Here you come.
You gonna take my man from me?
Yeah.
Be careful with my little soldier.
-Got a name for that one?
-No.
But he's one of the boys
they use in the stairwell.
-What about him?
-That's Little Man.
He's muscle.
You know his real name?
-Cl?
-Yeah.
-You need some privacy?
-No, it's all right.
He's cool.
What's with the hat?
Go ahead, tell him, Bubbles.
I go down the way
with some hats that I'm selling.
If someone is someone you need to know...
I put the red hat on them
and Kima here take the pictures.
If they in the mix, they get another color.
If they ain't shit, they don't get shit.
Everyone in the hat's
part of Barksdale's crew?
At the Terrace.
We haven't hit the low-rises yet.
That's sharp.
I like that.
Bubbles does not forget a face.
Ain't so good with names,
but, you know, faces I keep in my head.
I used to take him down to Escape Unit,
let him look through the warrant books.
He'd call me up that night,
telling me to go to this corner, that corner.
Yeah, paid $25 a pop.
-That's good money.
-Yeah.
How much does the hat routine pay?
Nothing.
We free on this.
-Motherfuckers beat my boy down.
-Who?
Little hoppers in the low-rises.
Who's your boy?
I got a friend.
Younger white boy.
Used to come down to the corners,
real green.
I was schooling him, you know?
What happened?
-They stomped him.
-You see it?
Fuck a man like that up
for a couple dollars, you know?
He still at University,
tubes all up in his nose.
Can't say but a fucking word or two.
But you know, that's how it goes, right?
How you feeling, Bubbles?
Restless.
Yeah, I could tell.
What the fuck?
Can you hook a nigger up with
$10 then till tomorrow?
I mean, you know, just to carry me, Kima.
Bubbles.
Obliged.
Stay out of the projects
the next couple of days...
just to be safe.
Girl's always fretting over me.
-Change it up, Bubs.
-Yeah, yeah.
Go Eastside.
Yeah, yeah.
$20?
-You gonna spoil him with that shit.
-I respect the work.
They used your name, Stringer, Wee-Bey...
Savino, Peanut....
They knew a lot of names. They knew a lot.
But you didn't say nothing?
Shit, man, I don't know nothing.
What was you writing then?
Yo, they was talking about
the man who got killed...
and his kids, they asked me to write.
-What you got to do with them, Dee?
-Yeah, that's what I said.
Then they cried
about how the kids ain't doing so good.
I'm like, it ain't gonna hurt for me
to say I'm sorry the man got killed.
Why the fuck you gotta say you're sorry?
Motherfuckers tried to
put your ass in the stir.
Yeah, but it didn't turn out that way.
You know, that's what I'm saying,
it's a shame that y'all....
I'm saying, it's a shame
what happened to that man, all right?
'Cause he didn't do anything
but come off the elevator...
when I was doing that thing
that I was doing.
What you think, cuz?
About what?
I'm saying, what you think
about what happened to the man?
You think we killed the motherfucker?
Speak your mind.
-Man, I don't know.
-Exactly.
You don't know,
and you don't need to know.
And if we did, we had a reason.
And if we didn't, we had a reason.
But either way,
you ain't got shit to do with it.
It ain't on you, cuz.
You feel me? It ain't on you.
Now, if you get jacked again...
I don't want to hear shit about
you writing nothing to no one.
-Got it?
-Yeah.
Come on, let's have some good times...
and get some ribs
before they done ate all the ribs up.
-This case isn't shit, Carv.
-I know it.
We're dancing around
with this motherfucker, typing shit out...
taking pictures of assholes in hats.
-What the fuck is that?
-It's bullshit.
I say we go down there right now.
Right fucking now.
We go into those towers,
and we let them know.
I'm serious.
You got to let these motherfuckers know
who you are.
You coming?
-I'm with you.
-Carv?
What the hell?
Let's do it.
Come on.
Shut it down. Five-O.
Five-O, five-O, break out.
Yo, come here, man.
Come here, where you going?
Don't act like you don't know me.
Get your hands up.
Put that down.
-Drop that shit! Kiss the fucking ground!
-Put your hands up.
Don't look at me like I ain't talking English.
You got a needle on you?
Got anything in here that's gonna stick me?
No? What's that?
What you got in your pockets?
You know what?
Put your pants down, man.
Put your pants down
and get down on the ground.
Get down on the fucking ground!
All right, spread your shit out.
Nice shoes. Think a happy thought.
Why don't you go somewhere else
with that bullshit?
No-good motherfuckers.
Stay down, man, stay down.
Y'all can let Barksdale and them know
who owns these towers.
'Cause we're coming back.
-I'm sick of this shit.
-Kiss my ass!
We roll out, come back in an hour,
catch everybody dirty.
You'll see how that goes.
-That's bullshit, man.
-Yo, stay down, man.
That's fucked up. Man ain't did nothing.
Want something?
-Move, shitbird.
-I ain't doing nothing.
Really? I got nothing for you.
-My eye, my eye.
-Who you gonna eyefuck now?
Are you serious?
You bleed on my car?
Don't bleed on my car.
Get your shit off my car.
What the fuck's the matter with you?
Got a visual?
Fuck.
Get the radio.
1 1 :35, Signal 13.
771 Franklin, in the Court.
Son of a bitch!
Shots fired, shots fired.
Officers need assistance.
I'm hit! Signal 13.
Officer down, Officer down!
Shit!
-Hello?
-You seen the paper?
-What?
-The newspaper, get it.
Hey, kids.
Oh, no.
You happy now, bitch?
McNulty!
Where in fuck is he?
He's detailed, Major, to Narcotics--
I fucking know where he's detailed.
I fucking already know that!
Yes, sir.
-Where is he right now?
-I can page him, sir.
Move that fucking desk out of my unit.
I do not want that
fucking man's desk in my unit.
That's Crutchfield's desk.
Crutchfield's?
McNulty sits here.
-What the fuck was that about?
-Did you see today's paper?
-Just sports.
-You gotta check out the front page.
-What do you think they'll do to him?
-Let me tell you something.
If he gets caught with his dick up the ass
of the deputy's wife...
he's still gonna have more of a career
than if they find out he's behind that story.
Lieutenant.
I saw the story in the paper.
I want you to know I had nothing to do....
-They jumped us, Boss.
-Who?
Fucking project niggers.
What are you doing here
at 2:00 in the morning?
Field interviews, sir, police work.
-Police work?
-Yeah.
I got a 14-year-old in critical
but stable condition at University...
and two witnesses who say
one of you princes...
cold-cocked him
with the butt-end of a pistol.
-No, sir.
-I got his mother over at lID...
filing a formal brutality charge...
which for Herc will make an even four
in the last two years.
-None sustained.
-But all of them true.
We thought that--
I got one less Crown Vic
than I had last night.
I'm out two Kevlar vests
that burned in the car...
two hand-held radios, a shotgun...
and I'm about to lose this idiot here
for a week or two of medical.
And for what?
What did you all learn
when you went to the Terrace...
at 2:00 in the morning
to conduct field interviews?
What valuable information did
we acquire from this situation?
IID is gonna be on all three of you
by afternoon...
and if you don't get a story straight
by then...
you're gonna have a file thick enough
to see the light of a trial board.
Now tell me, who cold-cocked the kid?
Me.
Why?
He pissed me off.
No, Officer Pryzbylewski,
he did not piss you off.
He made you fear for your safety
and that of your fellow officers.
I'm guessing now, but maybe...
he was seen to pick up a bottle
and menace officers Hauk and Carver...
both of whom had already sustained injury
from flying projectiles.
Rather than use deadly force
in such a situation...
maybe you elected to approach the youth,
ordering him to drop the bottle.
Maybe when he raised the bottle
in a threatening manner...
you used a Kel-Light,
not the handle of your service weapon...
to incapacitate the suspect.
Go practice.
You fuck the bullshit up
when you talk to lnternal...
I can't fix it, you're on your own.
-Push the arraignments back to 3:00.
-And the Gillette case?
The Gillette trial goes back
on the move docket.
Come on, walk with me. I'm running late.
-It wasn't me.
-The story quoted you.
Reporter has the story confirmed
when he calls me about the quote.
What am I gonna say?
No, he wasn't a witness?
No, he didn't testify in my court last week?
What?
You don't think it's around
about the witness?
Lawyers, clerks, jurors, everybody talks.
-I'm in the shit here, Your Honor.
-What can I tell you?
I called the deputy, not the newspapers.
I gotta run.
-You should have hung them.
-If I hang them, I hang myself.
I'm the man in charge, remember?
Besides, you don't
give your people up to lID.
You don't do that.
Even if they put
a 14-year-old kid into Critical Care?
This case, it's just....
Get out of it.
-How do I do that?
-I don't know.
But you can't lose if you don't play.
I always heard it
that you can't win if you don't play.
The department puts you on a case
it doesn't want.
You're given people
that are useless or untrustworthy.
Correct.
If you push too hard,
and any shit hits the fan...
you'll be blamed for it.
Correct.
If you don't push hard enough, and there's
no arrest, you'll be blamed for that, too.
Correct.
The game is rigged.
But you cannot lose if you do not play.
In the hole, y'all.
Hey!
Hey, you fuckheads!
Hey, police!
-Hello.
-Lieutenant Daniels?
Yeah.
Who was that?
It was the duty officer
down at University hospital.
What happened?
-He's blind in one eye.
-Who?
The kid. The 14-year-old.
Yo, the shit is late.
They're still vialing up.
Usually come off the train street-ready,
but this time they gotta vial.
Y'all got any testers, man?
-Yeah, later.
-Later?
Got any testers, man?
Nigger, it ain't even 9:00,
and you fiending on it.
Get the fuck out of here, man. Damn.
Why you act like that?
What, for these junkie motherfuckers?
So you just gonna take his money all day
and treat him like a dog?
-How I'm supposed to treat him?
-I don't know.
-But you ain't got to punk him like that.
-He punked himself.
He's a goddamn drug addict.
And you a goddamn drug dealer.
So? So what?
What, the customer's always right?
We're in the projects.
The customer be fucked up.
You can't give these niggers shit, man.
Why not? Why can't you?
Shit, everything else in the world get sold
without people taking advantage.
Scamming, lying, doing each other dirty.
-Why has it got to be that way with this?
-'Cause they dope fiends.
Yeah, but the game
ain't gotta be played like that.
You can't tell me this shit can't get done
without people beating on each other...
killing each other,
doing each other like dogs.
Without all that...
you ain't got 5-0 here on our backs
every five minutes...
-throwing us around and shit.
-Shit, man.
You think 5-0 would care
about niggers getting high?
In the projects?
Man, 5-0 be down here
about the bodies.
That's what they be
down here about, the bodies.
-Squires, young squires.
-What you want, nigger?
A little bag of styles, man,
a little bag of styles for you.
Check it out.
Only $5, what's up with that?
$5 make you
a gallant motherfucker, right there, boy.
Him, we know.
What are we facing from the riot?
Three witnesses' statements...
all of them saying the officer's assault...
on the youth was unprovoked.
You know how that goes, Commissioner.
People's idea of police brutality is
whenever we win a fight.
What does the state's attorney say?
He says it goes to a grand jury.
That's him doing Pontius Pilate.
The grand jury doesn't indict,
he looks clean for passing the buck.
-And if they do indict?
-They won't.
Criminal histories on our three witnesses...
one longer than the next.
Drugs, weapons, assault...
more drugs.
Shitbirds throwing dirt at good police.
Just the same, Lieutenant...
I want you to rethink...
whatever tactic led you to send
three plainclothes officers...
to do field interviews at the high-rises
at 2:00 in the morning.
Yes, sir.
I take it your people have union counsel?
Yes, sir.
Sir, I would request...
that pending the grand jury review...
Officer Pryzbylewski be placed
on administrative leave.
I can use him in-office,
but we shouldn't have him on the street...
until the grand jury signs off.
That's putting our tail between our legs.
I think our official stance has to be...
he did nothing wrong out there.
A 14-year-old is half-blind.
And two of ours were injured as well.
Goddamn right.
They were fucking shooting at us out there.
Bobby, what do you think?
Keep him off the streets...
until it clears the courthouse.
Okay, then, we'll wait on the grand jury.
Lieutenant. A moment, please.
What happened out there?
Did you know they were in the high-rises
without backup?
If I tell you yes...
I screwed up.
If I tell you no...
I'm putting my men in the jackpot.
Do you still want me to answer?
I screwed up, sir.
Good man,
willing to take one for the company.
To hell with the company.
I'm defending my own people here,
that's all.
What Major Valchek means to say
is that he's grateful that you...
extended your support
on behalf of Officer Pryzbylewski.
-Fuck-up that he is.
-He should be off the street.
What can I say? The kid needs...
a little guidance, a little supervision.
Stan here thought that if he got
a young officer back on the street...
where he might start over--
A new unit, a new lieutenant.
-You know, that it might bring him around.
-I understand he messed up here.
I understand that.
Which is why I'm saying to you...
I owe you...
for walking him
through this grand jury thing.
And to compensate,
Southeastern is sending you...
two new unmarked units,
and a surveillance van.
Plus, you need manpower...
while these guys are busy
with this lID thing...
all you do is ask.
Lieutenant.
So I've got suction with you, Valchek?
That's what I'm saying.
Deputy, always a pleasure.
A necessary evil.
-What?
-Valchek.
Is it insubordinate
if I ask what's so necessary?
Thanks for not cutting Pryzbylewski loose.
If you had, the department would be caught
between Valchek and city hall.
I owe you for that.
This Barksdale...
he's dug in.
It may take more than buy-bust.
And since it's been
in the press about the witness--
It's not an issue.
Keep it a tight little circle.
Give me three weeks of good street work
and you'll see this through.
A couple of felony warrants,
a little dope on the table.
That's all we need here.
Under no circumstances
is it accurate to suggest...
that this particular homicide
was the result of the victim...
having been a witness in an earlier case.
Reports to the contrary
are without factual merit.
Are you saying that you know definitely
that this man was not killed...
because he testified?
We think that...
I mean, that is...
we're looking into the
possibility that Mr. Gant...
was involved in a street dispute.
Which, of course,
would have nothing to do...
with his being a witness...
in an unrelated case
that concluded weeks ago.
But you haven't developed
a suspect at this time?
No, we haven't.
Bunk, shame on you, lad.
What did you expect him to do?
I don't know, grab the mike...
shove Rawls to the ground,
declare that all of Baltimore...
should rise as one because
they're murdering witnesses in cold blood.
That sounds more like one of your moves.
Been working on him two weeks,
we don't even have a photo.
It's fucking embarrassing.
Hey, Pat.
We got a job for you guys
to try to run down.
What is it?
We need a photo of this guy, Barksdale.
We need to know what he looks like.
-So go down to the B of l.
-You see, that's the problem, guys.
Barksdale's never been arrested
as an adult...
so we don't really have a B of I photo.
He had his juvenile record expunged,
so there's no photo there either.
Then you're fucked.
Yeah, we are.
But seeing as we all came into work today,
I thought, let's try something different.
We know from his mother's
social service record...
that Barksdale grew up
in Franklin Terrace, right?
It occurred to me...
being vaguely familiar
with the high-rises of West Baltimore...
that the housing project
began to take photos...
of every registered resident
as a security measure.
-Am I correct, Detective Greggs?
-Yeah.
So you want us to go down
to the housing department...
-and pull his photo.
-Excellent.
You know, you and l, we think as one.
We're like two horses together in a harness.
Why don't you fucking do it yourself?
Sure, if you don't mind sitting in my desk,
reviewing homicide folders...
taking meticulous notes,
trying to run down a few new leads.
It's boring, painstaking work,
but if you don't want...
to travel to the housing department,
I'll switch with you.
Fuck it, Patrick. Let's take a ride.
-That was inspiring.
-I'm a leader of men.
-What's up with shop?
-No re-up.
-Why not?
-'Cause we out of red caps.
Stink say we gonna have
a new package tomorrow.
New package?
Yeah, man, this weak-ass stepped-on shit
we got out here...
get these fiends agitated.
Look at them, they still buying it, though.
Yes, they're buying twice as much
and only getting half as high.
What was that?
Castle can't move like that.
Castle move up and down or sideways like.
-No, we ain't playing that.
-Look at the board, we're playing checkers.
-Checkers?
-Yeah, checkers.
Why're y'all playing checkers
on a chess set?
Why do you give a shit?
Man, we ain't got no checkers.
Yeah, but chess is a better game.
So?
No, hold up.
Y'all don't know
how to play chess, do you?
-So?
-So, nothing, man.
-I'll teach y'all if you want to learn.
-Come on, man. No, come on.
-We're right in the middle of a game.
-Chill out, I want to see this.
Y'all can't be
playing no checkers on no chessboard.
All right, man.
Look, check it, it's simple.
See this?
This is the kingpin.
And he the man.
You get the other dude's king,
you got the game.
But he's trying to get your king, too,
so you gotta protect it.
Now the king, he moves one space...
any direction he damn choose,
'cause he's the king.
Like this, all right?
But he ain't got no hustle...
but the rest of these
motherfuckers on the team...
they got his back.
And they run so deep,
he really ain't gotta do shit.
-Like your uncle.
-Yeah, like my uncle.
You see this? This is the queen.
She's smart and she's fierce.
She moves any way she wants,
as far as she wants.
And she is the go-get-shit-done piece.
Remind me of Stringer.
And this, over here, is the castle.
It's like the stash.
It moves like this.
And like this.
Dog, stash don't move, man.
Come on, think.
How many times we move
the stash house this week?
And every time we move the stash...
we got to move a little muscle with it
to protect it.
True, you're right.
All right. What about them little
bald-headed bitches right there?
These right here.
These are the pawns.
They're like the soldiers.
They move like this,
one space forward only...
except when they fight.
Then it's like...
or like this.
And they like the front lines.
They be out in the field.
So how do you get to be the king?
It ain't like that.
See, the king stays the king, all right?
Everything stays who he is...
except for the pawns.
Now if a pawn...
makes it all the way down
to the other dude's side...
he gets to be queen.
And like I said, the queen ain't no bitch.
She got all the moves.
All right, so...
if I make it to the other end, I win?
If you catch the other dude's king
and trap it, then you win.
But if I make it to the end...
I'm top dog.
No, it ain't like that, look.
The pawns, man, in the game...
they get capped quick.
They be out of the game early.
Unless they're some smart-ass pawns.
Nagras. Can you fucking believe this?
This shit is prehistoric.
What else have they got
down there in Property?
Eight-tracks? Victrolas?
That fucking department's a joke.
We got to get with the feds somehow.
They got light-weights,
wireless micro-recorders.
Yeah, DEA got those.
If I wear this on a warm day,
they're gonna know.
Even if they do a half-assed search,
I'm done.
Nagras.
Jesus.
You can't send his ass into the projects
with this shit taped to him.
That ain't gonna play.
I'm saying.
McNulty and the girl...
the lezzer from narcotics,
they've got the file.
-Who are you partnered with?
-McNulty.
But he don't have shit to do with me and
I don't want nothing to do with him neither.
Major, I'm a fifth wheel
on a car that's going nowhere.
Bring me home.
Soon enough.
Look, you're my eyes and ears
in this mess, right?
And I don't want no more surprises,
like that newspaper article.
If McNulty's planning
any more bullshit like that...
I got to be able to tell the deputy
before the shit flies.
Then you come home
with a favor in your pocket.
How bad is that?
Lieutenant.
You get Carver and Prez back tomorrow,
but Prez is in-office.
No police powers, no street work, nothing.
If the building catches fire,
he stays in the office.
-What about Herc?
-Medical, until Monday at least.
I wonder what you gotta do
to get thrown off this police force.
Keep on with some of your shit,
you just might find out.
Where are the fucking run sheets?
Behind the board.
You all go for a taste?
We got your picture,
don't you fucking worry, McNulty.
This is Barksdale?
Avon Barksdale.
I don't think so.
Read my lips.
Avon fucking Barksdale.
His name's on the form in the file.
Excuse me for giving a shit...
but I can't help but notice
this is a middle-aged white man.
You want something different,
you give me another name.
That's the only Avon Barksdale
in the housing department files.
You got your smokes?
Have a nice fucking day.
Maybe he's white.
No, I mean, really. What do we really know?
"Avon Barksdale.
"31 years of age.
"Born Provident Hospital, West Baltimore...
"to Willette Jackson Barksdale...
"father unknown.
"Educated Baltimore city schools."
Address is in the same public housing
where he controls the drug trade.
No flash, no profile.
Pretty much comes up out of nowhere.
No work history.
No tax information we can look at.
No cars in his name, no driver's license.
No kids.
No priors either.
Yeah, here's this vague CI information...
that states he stays in
various apartments out in the county.
Addresses undetermined, of course.
He moves from girlfriend to girlfriend...
might have another girlfriend in New York.
He likes to work out...
and he used to box Golden Gloves
when he was younger.
I've been working on him for two weeks
and the truth is, we don't know shit.
Golden Gloves?
How did you hear that?
I don't know.
I think I got that from a DEA File.
Or from a Cl...
who claimed to know him way back when.
So you write everything down?
Yeah, everything.
-Goddamn bomb, y'all.
-Blue-tops, blue-tops.
Double shorts.
In the hole, man.
Got blue-tops. Looking for blues?
In the hole, y'all.
-Blue-tops.
-Red-tops.
-Red-tops.
-Two for $10.
Blue-tops, blue-tops.
Keep your jab moving.
Move with your right. Left, right, left, right.
Two punches.
I got a few questions
I wanna ask you, Mack.
Keep your hands moving,
work to the body some.
So who's your target?
-Barksdale.
-Who?
Avon Barksdale.
-Never heard of him.
-That's the thing.
This guy's got
the Westside projects locked up.
He's tied to maybe a dozen murders,
he's completely off the radar.
-Avon, what was it?
-Barksdale.
If you say so.
DEA has a couple of pages
on him from NADDIS entries.
DEA has a couple of pages
on him from NADDIS entries.
Nothing in NCIC, no adult arrests.
I've been working drugs
for the Bureau since '98.
I can tell you, we got
nothing on him that I know.
This little thing...
is the smile of the week.
Watch this.
-What?
-What was that?
Get the door.
It's a career case.
Not that my bosses
give a damn at this point.
Why not?
Why not?
All of them mopes in bracelets
and not one of them named Osama.
I owe you, brother. What do you need?
A couple of lightweight body mikes.
Wireless, remote taping capability.
That's all?
Where I come from,
we're just happy to be in the 20th century.
Who's running the case,
so I can tell my squad supervisor?
Daniels, out of Narcotics.
All right, no problem.
Shit! Fucking rain, man.
All right, y'all know what the fuck this is.
-Up against the wall, hurry the fuck up.
-Come on, let's go.
Go on to the back.
Ain't got time for this shit.
Got some red-tops, some testers.
Get them around the corner.
Hurry up, take them around.
What the fuck you looking at me for?
Get your ass around the corner.
I want that shit, that's good.
Keep it moving.
-Man, you see that?
-Yeah.
Third from the end. That's the stash.
Some real raggedy-ass shit here, boy.
Very sloppy.
How old are your kids?
Mike is 8, Sean's 10.
That's the hard part.
Yeah, that's the hard part, but you know....
-How often do you get to see them?
-Every other weekend.
Trying to get more, but she's fighting me.
-Why would she fight you on that?
-She's getting even.
Getting even?
You must've been fucking around.
-I'm just saying.
-You're right.
It's always the case.
A woman wants to get even,
there's something extra there.
How come you got all this wisdom
and your life's so fucking hard?
I've been wondering on that myself.
How about you? You ever been married?
What'd I say?
-If you ain't gonna say anything, I am.
-What?
If you're a dog,
you barking at the wrong pussy.
What, so I'm a dog now?
-Meow.
-Bubbles.
I date women.
We've got something else in common.
I date women, too.
So pretty much everyone in CID
has worked this out but me?
There wasn't nothing to figure out.
I told them.
-I guess I missed the press conference.
-It's better that than to have every police...
on three shifts hounding you
every goddamned day.
-Cops are dogs.
-Yeah.
It's not like I was walking around...
waving some dyke flag in the air,
or some shit.
-I know I look like I could go either way.
-Lord, yes, you do. Yes, you do.
It was something I had to put out there
to get through the day.
-I should've known.
-Should've known what?
I worked with one other female police officer
who was worth a damn, only one.
-A lesbian.
-Yeah.
In the beginning, you're in your radio car...
alone, working your post.
-Most women aren't getting out of that car.
-Right.
Not without side partners showing up.
They're intimidated, physically.
-They gotta be.
-You weren't?
Yeah, at first.
But I'm talking about some old
straight-out-of-the-academy-type scared...
you know what I'm saying?
I wasn't about to stay scared.
You know, you get your ass kicked
once or twice...
you realize
it's not the end of the world, right?
Most of the women,
they don't want to believe that.
Some of the men, too.
They don't even want to go there.
-You think 'cause you're gay?
-I don't know.
But is there any other fucking way
to police?
All I know is I just love the job.
-That'll be $3.20.
-Keep the change.
Thanks, have a nice day.
Dee coming up.
Where's it all go?
The money. Where do all the money go?
$22,000 or $24,000, give or take.
From the low-rises?
Damn, boy!
You must have that crew humming.
I don't remember a day
we ever got this much from the Courtyard.
It wasn't even check day.
You doing good out there, Dee.
We'll be doing even better
when we get that new package.
New package, same as old, man.
-Say what?
-Ain't no new package.
Just gonna put that same shit
out in a different color gelcap is all.
Might spike that shit with some procaine
or some caffeine, but otherwise the same.
String, man,
people are already coming back on us...
-telling us that shit is weak.
-I know, the shit is weak.
But shit is weak all over.
The thing is, no matter what we call heroin,
it's gonna get sold.
The shit is strong, we're gonna sell it.
The shit is weak,
we're gonna sell twice as much.
You know why?
'Cause a fiend,
he's gonna chase that shit no matter what.
It's crazy, you know?
We do worse, and we get paid more.
The government do better,
and it don't mean no never mind.
This shit right here, Dee, it's forever.
That's your bonus right there.
And you buy something
that you wouldn't otherwise.
Thanks, man.
All right.
You remember me?
Do I remember you?
I was in here the other day,
you wanted a drink.
-Did I get a drink?
-Afraid not.
Then why would I remember you?
You want to be remembered,
you going about it the wrong way here.
All right.
The usual.
This here's my uncle's place.
You kin to Orlando?
No.
Orlando's like the up-front man, you know?
My uncle's the money man.
-Where you from?
-Right here.
-Baltimore.
-I know Baltimore, but, like, where?
You know Turner Station?
Down past Dundalk, near the Point.
The Point. So, you're a country girl.
-You mean county.
-Where I'm from, the county is the country.
Where is that?
So...
are you working with your uncle?
I'm his right hand.
Yes, you is.
You want to ride with us in the van?
-No.
-Why not?
You think it's a waste?
Touts and children,
that's all you're gonna get.
Bingo.
Where did you get this?
Now, look at this piece of shit.
I'm good to go, right?
Come here, let me see.
Detective Sydnor's ensemble.
It's the latest in Westside Project wear.
Have your torn cammies by Versace...
stained sweatshirt by Ralph Lauren.
-Where you miked?
-Down in my dick, man.
I figure they ain't gonna
go down there, right?
I don't know, Sydnor,
the way you twirling around...
might be the first place they look.
Fuck you.
I ain't showered in two days,
I ain't shaved in four.
Right now, I am one ripe,
nasty son of a bitch.
Bubbs.
What you think?
This your man?
Yeah.
Is he low-bottom enough for you?
Clothes is tore down enough...
but he could use a little bit more stains,
more dirt.
-What's this here, man?
-It's my wedding ring.
Shit, you married to the needle, boy.
That shit been pawned off, if you for real.
It's a dead giveaway.
You could stand to lose about 20 pounds,
some yellow in your teeth...
fresh bleeds on your hands.
So maybe I should go out
and shoot up dope for a year or two, right?
-Come back when I can carry the look off?
-I'm just saying, man.
The more tore down you look, the better.
You going down in them towers,
they gonna check everything.
How about the shoes?
I know you ain't got no problem
with the shoes, fucked up as they are.
Let me see the shoes, man.
See?
You walking down them alleys
of the projects...
you stepping on the dead soldiers.
-Dead soldiers?
-Yeah, empty vials.
You can't walk down a Baltimore street
without them cracking underneath your feet.
You want to know if a fiend is for real...
check the bottom of his shoes.
Okay.
Have him dance on some empties
before we go out there.
Get us killed.
He hurt your feelings?
A little bit.
Shit.
Four hand-to-hands...
two to me, two to Bubbs,
with me close enough to mark it.
-From who?
-Kids, mostly.
Young-ass hoppers.
It's a start.
They're pretty tight out here, Kima.
If you don't hand no money
to nobody that matters...
you don't get no product
from nobody that matters.
You want to go back in?
Shit, we copped from every crew out here.
Ain't we supposed to go off somewhere
and fire this shit up?
Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here.
Well, now.
Did you get to see where the money went
after you handed it off?
No.
Nothing but touts and runners here.
But then again, you told us so.
I didn't say that.
But as a matter of fact....
-Everyone else roll out?
-I--
You were upstairs and out of pocket,
so I cut them loose.
Just as well.
I'll give them the news tomorrow.
What happened?
I told the Deputy we had
a few hand-to-hands.
Low-level people.
He wants us to put everything
into search-and-seizures...
and hit the projects Wednesday afternoon.
-Lieutenant.
-I know.
Does he think that's what
gets us Avon Barksdale?
The buys we made,
they don't even go past the courtyards.
Scratch together everything
we got from the hand-to-hands...
and shape it into PC for the warrants.
A few locations, at least.
But we don't even know what doors to hit.
A few apartments in the low-rises
that we've seen used for stash.
Then we write on those.
Lieutenant, these guys change
stash houses every other day.
Look, the man upstairs wants to see
a circus.
A couple of days from now,
I got to show him three rings.
Christ.
I'm sorry. We gotta jump.
-What, is the Deputy Ops stupid?
-No.
This shit is fucking stupid.
Not if we bring in some arrests...
he takes them to the judge,
he figures the judge goes away.
And then he buries the fucking case.
What are we gonna do?
There's nothing you can do,
except pound out some probable cause.
-We're gonna be here all fucking night.
-I'm not.
-Where the fuck you got to go?
-No, I mean, I can't.
I'm not gonna help them gut the case.
I'm sorry.
I know he's your lieutenant.
You gotta do what you gotta do.
But I can't swallow this shit anymore.
-Why are you here?
-I'm thinking about something.
-Can I come in?
-No.
No?
What's the matter, McNulty?
No one ever tells you "no"?
Sorry. I should've called.
How do you clone a beeper?
-What?
-That's what I need to know.
You show up at my door at 9:00
to ask me that?
They're using pagers, right?
Every other drug dealer has a cell phone,
and these guys are all on pagers.
What do you want to do?
Bunk and me, when we jack up
the Barksdale kid...
he's got a Motorola pager.
We give it back, so as not to spook him.
You want to clone it?
Can we do that without a subpoena
to the pager company?
Read that.
-What is it?
-Affidavit from a state police case.
A judge signs something like that,
you can clone a beeper.
Christ.
Probable cause,
coupled with an exhaustion argument.
You've got to show the judge
that other investigative methods have failed.
You'll also need a supervisor
who wants you to clone a suspect's pager...
knowing that it might lead
to who knows what else...
pen registers, wiretaps.
Daniels will come around.
Daniels will have your ass.
Thanks.
-That's it?
-What?
No.
Let me understand.
You're married,
and a date's a room at the Best Western.
Now you're single, and a date
is you coming over unannounced...
to learn the legal requisites
for a pager intercept.
Pretty much.
No.
Okay, I hear you.
You?
As if you give a shit.
You're an asshole, McNulty.
What the fuck did I do?
-How much more to that pack?
-50, 60.
Re-up's late.
Have Wallace hit Stinkum
on his pager again.
You want something from carry-out?
Yeah, lake trout sub.
Pay up.
Damn.
You asked, I thought you was treating.
You thought wrong, I ain't no bank.
You stingy like one.
Just make sure you give me enough.
-No mayo, extra hot, something to drink.
-All right.
-He's going for food?
-Yes.
Why didn't you tell me?
My stomach's growling like a motherfucker.
-Starve, nigger.
-Man, shit.
Re-up's here.
Stink, what up?
What's up, bro? 10 minutes.
-10?
-Yeah.
All right.
Who's there?
Y'all got my back, you heard?
Get the fuck in there.
Get your ass down.
Sit your stupid ass down.
Get the fuck down. Shit, stay there, bitch.
Get down, get the fuck down, motherfucker.
Where it at?
-Ain't nothing here.
-Where it at, man?
Shit! Fuck, my leg!
Where it at, shorty?
-Kitchen, under the sink.
-Go on and get that.
Two G-packs. Let's roll.
Two G-packs. Let's roll.
-Just two?
-Come on.
What the--
Stupid.
Shit!
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Shit!
Come on, Poot.
Fuck!
-So, your man saw them get jacked?
-Yeah, part of it.
-And he gets the tag number?
-Good man, that Bubbles.
Listen up.
Western uniforms will meet us
in the Mount Claire parking lot.
We start there, and we don't stop
until we take the doors.
I want their lookouts
to have as little chance as possible.
What's with you?
My office.
-I'm not going.
-You're insubordinate?
I'm not jumping out
on something that will harm the case.
-You want to write me up on that, you can.
-You think I want this?
I got the Deputy Ops on my ass for this shit.
Now you show me up
in front of the whole detail.
I don't mean to show anybody up.
-Get your vest on.
-No.
I got police work to do.
If you felt this way,
why didn't you call in sick?
I'm not sick.
Yeah, you are.
Give me a 95 on why you are physically
unable to participate in today's action.
What, I'm gonna lie so you can save face?
Come on, write it up.
"I can't jump out with my unit
because my tummy hurts."
I'm not gonna help you gut this case.
If you want to pretend to be police,
you go ahead.
Let's do it.
I'm up.
-You're on medical.
-I'm up, boss.
Give him a vest.
No, motherfucker.
It ain't just up to Stinkum to be muscle.
You got the Pit.
Your people supposed
to be ready for the re-up.
You supposed to be steady for him.
But where you at?
You in the goddamn sandwich shop.
You got $20,000, Dee,
coming into your shop...
and you ain't even around
to see that shit right.
Look, I thought re-ups--
No, thinking was what you wasn't doing,
and now we look like bitches.
You feel me? We got to come back on them.
And you can't even tell me shit
about who they was.
One of them was named Omar.
-Omar?
-Omar, that's the name I heard.
-And they had a white van.
-Yeah, I saw the van--
-What kind of van?
-Five-0.
-Wrong door.
-Yeah?
Yeah, switched it yesterday.
Let's see your hands.
Get out of the way. Let's see your hands.
Up, motherfucker, up. Turn around.
All the way up.
Police. Put your hands up. Put them up!
Turn your monkey ass around.
Put your hands at your back.
Why you fucking with us, man?
Come on, man, damn,
I wasn't even doing shit.
Come on, man.
Cuff that one, and that one.
Motherfucker, how's that feel?
You fucked up now. You feel it, right?
Why you ain't swinging?
Motherfucker. Go ahead,
play that cowboy shit, motherfucker.
Hold him down. Hold his arms!
Spread your legs.
Don't make me kick your ass, too.
Come on!
Get him. You don't hit a cop.
What's wrong with you, boy?
You wanna hit a cop?
If you'd been here earlier,
you'd have seen a beating.
Clean. Not a fucking thing in there.
Pick any door in the low-rises.
What are the chances?
Channel 2 wants to know if she can film
some of the places we raided.
She says whatever we got, she'll put on film.
-Whatever we got?
-Drugs, weapons.
We ain't got shit.
I can tell you were never in patrol.
Right.
-Sorry I'm late.
-What's up?
I didn't want to tell you in front of the girl,
her being from Narcotics and all.
Daniels is dirty.
What?
The guy running your case,
he's got dirt on him.
You know this?
Your own agency came to us with
concerns about him last year.
Integrity questions.
They didn't want to go to lnternal Affairs.
That office leaks like a sieve.
Plus they couldn't handle a case
if their lives depended on it.
-That, too.
-You looked at Daniels specifically?
We did a two-month assets investigation.
The man has a couple hundred thousand
more in liquid assets...
than any police lieutenant should ever have.
Maybe he goes to Atlantic City. Seriously.
You look at his background?
Maybe he's got other sources of income.
Maybe. We never got the chance
to go further.
Why not?
We went to your Deputy for Operations
and told him what we had.
-You took it to Burrell?
-He says, "We'll take it from here."
So, we backed away and waited
for something to happen.
-And waited.
-That was a year ago?
Maybe more.
And that fucker's still
the Supervisor for Narcotics.
So, you tell me what the hell's going on.
Anyway, if he's running your case,
I just thought you'd want to know.
Thanks.
Fuck me.
I'm dying here.
Let me get on the other side,
work it from there.
One, two.
-Three.
-Three.
Shit.
Need help?
Right. On three, motherfuckers.
One, two, three.
I'm embarrassed for you all.
Yo, Herc, I catch my breath,
I'm gonna shoot the drawers off this bitch.
It's caught on something, Lieutenant.
Get over there with Carver.
One, two, you know what to do.
What the fuck?
Jesus. My ass is kicked.
I could move it a bit when I was alone.
It must've got wedged in the door somehow.
Desk is empty, right?
-Yeah.
-You checked it?
At this rate, we're never gonna get it in.
What?
In?
In.
Unbelievable, unbe-fucking-lievable.
Christ.
This case is a bit humble for you.
I know it doesn't look like much on paper,
but see what you can do.
-Making new friends?
-Not yet.
I spent the morning down in juvenile court...
but the kids know they can't be hurt
with a street-weight charge...
so didn't get much there.
You tried?
Nothing like being told,
"Fuck off," by a 14-year-old.
-Right here's our best shot.
-Him?
Hand-to-hand with Bubbles,
and he's carrying a long-ass sheet.
All right. Who's first? Ms. Dawkins?
State versus Marvin Browning, Your Honor.
One count distribution of a controlled
substance, to wit, heroin...
and one count distribution of a controlled
substance, to wit, cocaine.
-Quantity?
-One gelcap and one vial, Your Honor.
Bail recommendation?
State requests defendant be held,
as he is part of a continuing investigation...
and further, is subject to a mandatory
five years without parole...
because of prior convictions.
Will your office be seeking
the mandatory five in this case?
Absolutely, Your Honor.
Very well, I'll take that into consideration.
Got his attention, at least.
Lieutenant, come have a taste.
Come on, we're celebrating.
Patrick's going out on medical.
Sweet, sweet Cervical 6.
My shoulder's numb, my arm's numb.
My fingers feel like they belong to
some son of a bitch in the next county.
This is my ticket out of
this rat-shit department.
66 2l3% pension,
and I don't have to wait for my 30.
-I'm gone.
-Fucking yo did you a favor.
Kid hit like a mule, I've got to say.
You should take a couple of days.
Think it over before you put in papers.
My brother-in-law's got
a video store out on Moravia.
Does $6,000 a week straight rentals,
another $8,000 in porn.
He needs a partner.
But they take that off
the top of a medical pension.
If you report it as income, they do.
Do I look that fucking stupid?
Have a nice life, Lieutenant.
What's with you?
You gonna miss me, Augs?
What the fuck am I going to do, Paddy?
Tell you what.
-What do you say we go out together?
-What do you mean?
I mean, it only hurts for a minute.
And it doesn't have to be line-of-duty either.
I'm serious. You know those stairs where
they send us down to the basement?
-Yeah.
-It's dark down there.
You go up eight or nine steps,
let go of the rail, take a little jump--
-I'd break my fucking neck like that.
-You don't break nothing.
You do a little dance on those steps,
you're up to two-thirds with me.
And maybe you sue the city,
get a little more.
Can't say we don't deserve it.
Five in. For a one-and-one.
Now, why bang me like that
for a one-and-one?
Because it's your turn, Mr. Browning.
Everybody out there gets a turn.
You're all running wild here.
I think a judge might want to...
take a look at this
and slow you all down a mite.
I don't know, Marvin.
I'm looking at your sheet here, and...
for one thing, it's a little wrong
to be calling it a sheet.
More like a book.
Point is, we got the room
to get a little crazy on you.
Like she said, it's your turn.
Tell us some stories,
it could be somebody else's turn.
Stories.
Avon Barksdale.
Know the name?
Every motherfucker up in them towers
knows the name.
Myself, I ain't never really
had a word with the man.
Stringer Bell, then?
Wee-Bey? Savino?
Stinkum? C.C.O.? Roc-Roc?
Who're you gonna give us, Marvin?
You don't say a name soon,
you're gonna be courtside.
All right.
All right, what?
All right, I'll take the years.
Damn, boy.
You should see the cop.
When you're ready to get up, put that on.
-Report to bunk A-7.
-A-7.
Don't be later than breakfast.
Who else is up in here?
Anybody from Westside?
D.C. boys, mostly.
Long fucking drive.
Me and you drawing another shit detail.
-This ain't a shit detail.
-No?
I'm in Upper fucking Marlboro, Maryland,
and still going south.
Look. Another cow.
Use your imagination.
This little shitbird, having already been
whipped good by us once...
he sees us, right?
And he starts crying like a little bitch...
because he knows we drove
all the way to Prince George's...
for more of his ass, right?
Imagine we jack him up,
toss him into a small room...
and tell him that Detective Mahone
is near dead from the sucker punch.
No shit. The drunk old fuck
suddenly slipped into a coma.
And now the Commissioner and
Mrs. Mahone are at his bedside in the ICU.
And we've been ordered to come down here,
rip off his scrotum, put it in a jar...
and drive it back to Baltimore, so it can sit
with the fucking bowling trophies...
behind the bar at the FOP Lodge.
All right? After which...
fucknuts stops whimpering long enough...
to just start giving people up, whoever.
Stringer Bell. Avon Barksdale.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
Little prick turns on everybody...
and we break the case wide open.
-Cool.
-Right?
So, from all them hand-to-hands,
nobody flipped?
No, that part of town,
Barksdale carries more weight than we do.
Just like all these fucking homicides.
Witnesses lying, witnesses paid off,
witnesses backing up on their story.
-Can you blame them?
-Not really.
Every now and then, we visit the projects.
They live there.
-Your man's Dee, right?
-D'Angelo, yeah.
This one's got a Dee as a possible shooter.
-This one connects.
-No way.
Yeah? I'm seeing it.
-It's Diedre Kresson, one of Keeley's cases.
-Come on, Jay, this is a college girl...
blown up in the kitchen
of an apartment up in Northeast.
How does this match with the rest
of the Westside mopes?
-They don't have cars?
-This doesn't match, Jay.
It does. Take a look at your office report.
A witness puts her
with a Dee the night she's aced.
How many Dees do you think
there are in the system, Jay?
As a street name?
Let me ask you something, Jimmy.
How many case files you got
that you're putting on Barksdale?
-Maybe a dozen.
-A dozen cases.
So, how many of those are from our squad?
One. Gerard Bogue.
One case?
Your squad's down a man for weeks, Jimmy.
We're gonna be humping your calls,
catching your cases...
hopping around like a one-legged pigtown
whore on check day, and for what?
So that you can have your big adventure
and solve everybody else's cases?
Is this what I'm hearing?
He's got you, Jimmy.
Where's the love, McNulty?
Show me some fucking love.
-All right.
-Attaboy. He's my son.
Why don't you just dump
this loser on Santangelo?
He's supposed to be down here
helping us, anyway.
I would if I could find the fucker.
Must have another job, he's gone so much.
-What does Daniels have to say about that?
-Nothing, I cover for him.
He was out in the wind there
all day yesterday, half the day before.
Man, Keeley really dogged this one.
Ain't nothing in here but a 24
and some crime scene photos, and this.
"Tywanda called.
N.F.D., no last name, no address.
"Claims your victim killed
after being visited by a suspect named Dee."
No further description.
There's a callback number, though.
So, call.
The number you have reached
has been disconnected.
Disconnected.
"He got you, Jimmy."
All right, motherfucker, he got me, too.
So, I'm gonna call Verizon,
see if they got a fresh listing.
You happy now, bitch?
You sure about that tag, Bubs?
I seen the van.
It cleared the Court
and rolled up Amity toward Lexington.
Plates were reported stolen off a car parked
right here, on this block.
So you're thinking they're from
right around here?
Maybe.
Word in the Towers said
it was Omar and his crew.
-Omar? Who's he?
-You ain't know Omar?
Omar, the terror. Been ripping and robbing
out here for years now.
-Is he fierce?
-That nigger don't play.
-Got a last name?
-Just Omar.
He don't need no last name.
Who's his family?
You remember No-Heart Anthony?
Came up with him, they brothers.
No-Heart Anthony?
Miss Kima, do not tell me
you don't remember No-Heart Anthony.
Damn, girl. What town you been policing at
all these years?
And right now, I am personally
ashamed to be your snitch.
-Shit.
-What?
-I'm late for my class.
-Class?
-1 2-14.
-12-14?
Requesting anyone in my unit who's up
to report to Channel 13.
35, I got that.
Package be moving.
Avon's stuff always be good.
It's a sweet score?
It's all right.
That play was a little bit
raggedy in there, though.
I fucked up, I know, letting go your name.
I don't really care you shouted me out.
Everybody in these projects
been knowing Omar, you heard?
I just don't want them
coming down on you, baby-boy.
Shirley coming with her game.
-Every fucking day with that shit.
-Mr. Omar?
My check late.
Yo, Mike. Hook a sister up, yo.
So, what next, yo?
Got some iron.
Thinking about working
the flush-and-run over on the Eastside...
till things cool a mite.
That'll work.
-So you don't want to lay over here tonight?
-No.
-Sure?
-No, I'm gonna go see my mom.
-Keep it close.
-I hear that.
Who the man?
I gotta be somewhere first,
but I'll run him back downtown after.
No problem, thanks for answering.
-Bubbs.
-McNulty.
What's up?
You ever heard of No-Heart Anthony?
Who, Anthony Little?
1058 Argyle, Apartment 16-J.
He's up in Hagerstown on a robbery bit.
What about him?
My man.
Fuck y'all.
You know how the cracker motherfuckers do
when they kill a deer?
Or, like, when they go out
killing animals and whatnot?
Got them on the front of the truck...
tied up, stretched out,
so everybody could see it?
You feel me?
I'm serious, that's what I want.
I want that motherfucker on display.
I'm gonna send a message
to the courtyard about this motherfucker...
so people know we ain't playing.
Yeah, we got people on it.
You tell them it's $1,000 on the bucks...
and it's $2,000 on Omar.
-Yeah, Bird's on it.
-Savino, too.
You know, Bird jailed
with Omar down the cut, right?
He said he all a faggot.
A faggot? Get the fuck out of here.
Yeah, said he had a whole
stable of boys down in Jessup.
This punk motherfucker got even less use
for pussy now that he home.
So, he gotta a lotta heart for a cocksucker?
Yo, we doubling down
on Sweet Lips, all right?
We make it motherfucking $4,000 on him...
$6,000 if I get the chance to
holler at him before he get got.
-Say no more.
-Take care of all that.
Stickup come up dead
on the stash one night.
-Police jumping out the next.
-Something up at the Pit?
Maybe, yeah.
-What's up with my nephew?
-I don't know. He doing good.
He making that money out the hole, but...
he might have a problem
he don't know about.
I'm on him.
Yo, where in
Leave it to Beaver-land are you taking me?
I'm late for something.
I'll drop you after,
on the way back downtown.
-What you late for?
-Soccer.
Suck what?
Get in the goal!
Spread it out, spread it out, there you go.
First team, fall in!
-Dad!
-Mikey, how are you?
-Who's winning?
-They are, 4-1 .
4-1? Who got the goal for you guys?
-Ricardo, my assist.
-Assist? That's good.
You've got to drink on the breaks, okay?
I don't want you to get dehydrated.
-Hi.
-Hey.
This is Bubbles.
-Hi.
-Second team, come on!
-Go on, Mike, go get 'em.
-Bye, Dad.
You're late. He thought you weren't
gonna come this time either.
This job, you know this job.
I can't get out here
when he gets off the bus at 4:00.
I need more than every other weekend.
He needs me more, so does Sean.
I'm not giving up any more weekends.
50-50 split's all my lawyer says
I have to give--
It's not 50-50 if I don't
see him all goddamn week.
-You see him every day--
-Don't curse at me. My lawyer says--
Fuck your lawyer.
Fuck you.
-Did you see?
-Yeah, I saw.
Come on, you get out.
This good for you?
Thin line between heaven and here.
How did he know where the stash at?
The knockos don't know, but he do.
Because some nigger's snitching.
Man, ain't nobody got to be snitching
for Omar or his boys...
to creep by and see where the stash at.
-Damn, Bodie. Fucked that nigger up.
-They stomped his ass.
-Damn, Bodie. Fucked that nigger up.
-They stomped his ass.
How he ain't courtside
for banking a knocko?
Boy, how you get home so quick?
-Nigger, what you steal?
-Camry XLE.
You all want a ride?
It's right around the corner.
Man, Boy's Village ain't shit.
I'm just too bad for that off-brand
little-boy bullshit, man.
It can't hold me.
What you laughing at? What's so funny?
If you was me,
your ass would still be down there.
You ever seen a city jail, nigger?
You ever caught a body?
I'm the one who just got home, remember?
Eight months over on Eager Street
with a body on me.
-Yeah, you got the one.
-Yeah, the one you know about.
You little motherfuckers need to ask around.
Yo, out near the county, right,
on the high end of the Eastside?
They got these apartments, out there, right?
So there was this little shorty
who used to stay out there.
She was, like....
I ain't seen a female that fine since.
I gotta say, Shorty was right.
You fucked her?
No, man, it wasn't like that.
This was a shorty
my uncle was messing with.
They was going on at it for a little while...
till she find out that my uncle got another
little shorty round the way.
More right to say he got a few of them
around the way...
know what I'm saying?
So, she goes off the hook,
talking about calling the police...
about shit she ain't supposed to know.
-Oh, shit.
-Yeah, you know it.
But see, I got some creep to me,
and my uncle, he know that shit.
So they roll me out past her crib.
And they show me how she lives
right on the ground floor, first level.
I go creeping around the back,
to the back window.
I got the .45 on me, the big gun.
I walk up to the window and I look in,
and it's dark as shit...
because it's 3:00 a.m.,
and you can't see shit.
What did you do?
So I pulled out the piece...
and I start tapping with the back of it
on the window.
And it was quiet, but it was loud enough
so she can hear that shit.
That's what she heard, yo.
Sure enough, she comes out.
She's naked and shit.
I don't know why the fuck,
but she has a robe...
and as she slipping on her robe,
she turns on the light...
and when she does that,
and it's light on the inside...
she can't see shit on the outside.
Damn, she naked.
She hears that shit on the window
and she ain't got no choice...
but to walk over there and see what it is.
She steps up...
Iooks out...
see where it's coming from.
What happened?
He shot her.
Yo, Dee, if she was all that,
why didn't you fuck her first?
-Nigger, you sick, just shut up.
-What? I'm just saying....
There is something seriously wrong.
This is ridiculous.
Because a lab freezer goes out
with an electrical short...
blood samples in 56 homicides...
15 rapes, are allowed to putrefy.
-State's attorney knows?
-The mayor, too.
Most of our trace lab is now 25 years old.
You ever go outside for money?
The non-profits?
Such as?
The Abell Foundation, for one.
My brother's on the board.
If you want me to run it up there for you....
-You could swing that?
-Never hurts to ask, does it?
It never does, Your Honor.
So, in that same spirit...
where are we with the Barksdale probe?
My other reason for stopping by.
Hand-to-hands and search-and-seizures,
I've heard about these.
Some mid-level players caught up,
as you can see.
Look, it's not a knockout blow,
but we sent a clear message.
I don't see Barksdale's name anywhere...
or Bell, or anything about the murders.
The casework, it goes towards that.
No.
So, we've got work to do, don't we?
Police, open the damn door!
-What?
-Open the motherfucking door!
-Upstairs front clear.
-Kitchen's clear.
I'm at the backdoor.
-Anybody pop out here?
-Okay, quiet.
Upstairs rear, clear.
I'm gonna beat this bitch
like a red-headed stepchild...
for hiding up in this pisshole.
Goddamn creepy crawlers everywhere.
Tell Bodie we're on his ass.
I'm sorry for cursing at the door.
I mean, I couldn't see that it was only you.
Is it the drugs again?
Would you like to sit down?
Preston came to me when my daughter died.
He was four years old.
But even then, I knew he was angry.
His mother lived out there, caught up in it.
After a while, you couldn't make her
see nothin' else.
No, man, that wasn't us.
2:30 in the towers?
You guys are crazy, man.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
So, how you think you gonna carry it?
I'm sorry, ma'am.
And I'm sorry for the way
we came through here.
If Preston comes past...
give him this...
and tell him we need to talk, okay?
I'm sorry.
What the fuck you doing in there?
Talking.
-Talking?
-Yeah.
-See you later.
-All right, catch you later.
I'm driving.
Yeah?
McNulty.
Some judge for you.
Yeah?
Look, can I call you back?
-Major, sir?
-Yeah.
I've been thinkin'.
It's a clear violation of the general orders,
I know, but....
Last night, I'm at home,
I'm sittin' up buck naked.
And I got one hand wrapped around
a cold domestic beer...
and the other wrapped around
my magnificent, flaccid...
four-and-one-half inch wonder,
and I am trying with all my might...
to remember what Leila Kaufman's nipples
looked like...
when her bathing top slipped off
at the Hillendale pool swim party.
-Leila Kaufman?
-Yes, sir.
Summer of '72.
I got this saucy wench
in my gun-sights, so to speak...
and I am dangerously...
close to engorged...
when all of a fuckin' sudden,
out of fuckin' nowhere...
fuckin' Detective, fuckin' Jimmy McNulty
pops into my head.
McNulty?
Obviously, I gotta open my eyes
and admit to myself...
that my whole night is ruined.
At which point, I got nothing to do...
but think about the problems
of Jimmy McNulty.
Because, clearly, this guy...
and his fuckin' problems are standing
between me and all worldly pleasure.
Clearly.
First of all, it's not Jimmy's fault.
-No?
-No.
Jimmy is an addict, sir.
What's he addicted to?
Himself.
It's not funny, sir.
As a matter of fact,
it's a fuckin' tragedy is what it is.
The guy, he has come to believe...
that he is always the smartest fuck
in the room.
And you know what? It's not his fault,
because let's face it...
he's not going to Johns Hopkins
or joining Mensa...
he's taking a fuckin' job
with the Baltimore Police Department.
His first two years in Homicide,
he's in Ulmansky's squad...
partnered with Tony Lamartino.
Christ, it must've been months even...
he was the smartest fuck
in the fuckin' room.
What's your point, Jay?
My point is...
he can't help it.
It makes him an asshole, I know...
but it's also what makes him good police.
Last year, he gives me eight clearances.
One of them was a decomp floater...
who was John Doe for three weeks.
Tell your boy to wrap up that bullshit detail
in two weeks.
He does that, he comes home, clean slate.
You would've loved it.
Burrell is sittin' across from me
with a handful ofstreet-level arrests...
pretendin' he has a plan.
So, what did you tell him?
"Never shit a shitter, Deputy. "
That's what I fuckin' told him.
-I did good, right, Jimmy?
-I gotta go.
"Discuss the Hicks ruling
as a manifestation...
"of the judiciary's attempt
to maintain a speedy disposition...
"of criminal cases within
a modern court system."
What?
That's what I said.
"What?"
What the hell's the Hicks ruling?
Did you highlight my sofa?
What? No.
Yes, you did.
That was there from before.
Hell it was.
Damn, Kima, marker does not come out.
-No, I didn't do it, I swear.
-Okay, let me see the marker.
You want my marker,
I need to see a warrant.
I'm serious, I need to see
some probable cause.
I'm gonna beat your ass.
How about that for probable cause?
-Give me the marker.
-Damn, gettin' all violent and shit.
You know you just violated my civil rights?
That's it, new rule: no marker on the couch.
You get over to that table over there
and do your homework.
Go. Take it and go.
Gimme my marker.
I'm gonna need some club soda.
Damn, girl, this cell phone bill
must eat up the paycheck.
No, most of that's work,
it's on the company.
Phelan won't let go.
Are we anywhere close on Barksdale?
-No, sir.
-So, what are you telling me?
I'm not telling you anything, sir.
I'm waiting for you to tell me.
I can do whatever
you need me to do with this.
If you want me to push it further,
I can do that.
If you want it to go away....
If you wanna bring in someone else,
maybe do things differently.
You looking for the back door, Lieutenant?
Already?
McNulty says this case needs a wire.
You think he's right?
It needs somethin'.
Just climb your ass up the pole, man.
No, man. This'll work.
I'm not climbin' no damn ladder.
You never gonna hit it, man.
Bomb!
-Housing must think we just dumb.
-Is that--
-That's your pager or mine?
-That's me.
-Yo, watch that shit on my head.
-Man, it ricocheted off the fuckin' camera.
Yeah, you need some aim.
Yo, who this?
So, what do you think?
Title 3?
Right, but it's not for a wiretap.
It's to clone a pager, I got it from Pearlman.
-Pagers?
-Some kind of throwback thing.
-You mean, why not cell phones?
-Right. Who uses pagers anymore?
Tell you what, I was checking out
a wireless bill last night.
Every incoming call was listed.
Right. So, if we get Barksdale's pager,
we might get off the street.
Maybe even trace some supply.
So, who's No-Heart Anthony?
No-Heart ran drugs in the homes
in the early '90s.
So, a couple years back, I don't know why...
he finds himself in Randallstown,
tryin' to take off a jewelry store.
He fucks it up, half the county
chases him back downtown.
And I guess No-Heart figures
he's not up for doing the time...
'cause he puts a .44 against his chest,
pulls the trigger.
A .44?
It's a contact wound.
Wakes up two hours later
in the University ER.
-With a new nickname.
-Right.
Bubbles says it's Anthony's brother...
who took off with the Barksdale stash
the other night.
Dude named Omar.
It's not the easiest trade, you know,
robbin' dealers.
Man like that is likely to have
a weapon on him.
We jack him up, there's a charge to work off.
And if he knows where
the Barksdale stash is...
he probably knows a whole lot more.
See? Another plan.
The thing is, we're gonna have to sell this.
You wanna raise it with Daniels?
He'll listen to you more than me.
Where's Santangelo?
He's at ECU. He's got a case going today.
As of today, I haven't heard anything
to the contrary, so...
we're gonna press on.
Ideas?
We could continue with the busts.
But I don't think that's gonna
get us too far off the street.
On the other hand, the people we pulled in
last week had pagers.
So did D'Angelo Barksdale
when McNulty jacked him up.
We could clone a couple of pagers,
see where that takes us.
-Clone what?
-Their pagers.
They get beeped, we get beeped.
We see who's calling, from what number.
If they're all that,
why are they still using pagers?
Why not un-ass a few dollars
for cell phones?
It's a discipline.
You can't bug a pager.
But you can't make a call
with a pager, either.
You're gonna want a pen register
on all the payphones in the low-rises...
and any other phones
that link to the pagers.
What would it take to do the pagers?
A wiretap affidavit.
I think we got enough PC
from the hand-to-hands and surveillance.
We got most of the exhaustion.
I'm exhausted just listening to this shit.
Good. Exhaustion is a legal requirement
for using electronic intercepts.
We gotta prove nothing else works.
See, we did the raids, we made the arrests,
but nobody flipped.
We don't have an informant
who takes us anywhere above the street.
That's pretty much exhaustion.
All we got left to do now
is follow one of these mopes...
and prove to ourselves we can't do it.
We try to show a judge we can't make...
the case by following these guys,
and we can't.
How can we keep on any of them
when they're in those towers?
But you gotta show you tried.
Do we have a pager number?
This was written on the stash house wall...
with the letter "D" next to it.
Is that D'Angelo? Did you check it?
It's him.
Let's do this.
What does he want us to do?
I don't understand.
I'll explain it to you if you buy me breakfast.
Will you explain to me again...
why I'm about to rework
a six-month-old crime scene?
Look at this narrow-ass file.
Keeley didn't do shit on this.
He did the scene, though.
This is Keeley we're talking about.
Fucking Jay and his leaps of logic.
This case is nowhere near
anything we're doing.
So? Give it a shake or two anyhow.
-Make a sergeant happy.
-Whatever.
Do you know Lester Freamon?
A little. Why?
He's with us on this Barksdale thing.
I thought you said they gave you humps.
He looks like a hump, he acts like a hump,
sittin' there, playing with his toy furniture.
Jimmy, he makes more money off of
that shit than you do off of this job.
-Don't let Lester fool you.
-He did already.
Today in roll call, he showed something.
Hey, he's natural police.
He used to be Homicide.
-Why did he leave?
-Ask him.
-This is the one?
-Yup. Hasn't been rented since.
Fuck.
Motherfucker.
Fucking fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
What the fuck?
Fuck.
Fuck.
-No.
-Fuck.
Fuck it.
Fuck.
Motherfuck.
Fuck.
Fuckity, fuck, fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Motherfucker.
Fuckin' A.
Fuck.
Check this.
Motherfucker.
Fuck me.
Sydnor's on foot, Carv's in the car...
Herc, you need to be
on top of the roof behind Amity.
Again, I get the shit detail?
The plan is to stay on D'Angelo.
If we lose him, we lose him, right?
We're gonna lose him.
You can't follow people in the towers.
You can't hang in the low-rises
unless you got a reason.
Just to make sure,
we want to lose him, right?
Losin' him is good?
Right.
Then why the fuck do this?
Come on, Herc.
Roll with me on this one, all right?
So, you're police after all.
You know what you doing,
but you ain't been doing it.
How long you been in the Pawnshop unit?
13 years and four months.
-13 years?
-And four months.
I gotta ask you...
what exactly does a police officer assigned
to the Pawnshop unit do?
You intake reports
from registered pawnshops...
on all items valued over $50.
Then you make an index card for that item.
Then you file that index card.
If someone wants to find out
if something stolen was pawned...
we see if we have an index card.
If we do, we do, if we don't, we don't.
-You did that for 13 years?
-And four months.
Why'd you ask out of Homicide?
Wasn't no ask about it.
You got the boot?
What'd you do to piss them off?
Police work.
I think I need to buy you a drink.
Just one?
Caught this case in a Brooklyn home
in the summer of '87.
80-year-old woman, stabbed up...
nightgown, in bed,
forced window, rear entry.
Worked it for a couple of weeks.
Got the names of two squirrels
over in Curtis Bay.
Squirrel number one gives it up...
and tries to put all the weight
on squirrel number two.
Back up the statements?
Print it on the rear window for number two...
another one for number one
on the medicine chest.
So, it's down, yeah?
Even better when squirrel number one
drives it by the house...
where they fenced the old lady's shit:
clock-radio, TV, toaster oven.
So, what's the problem?
The problem is the fence.
Turned out he was the son
of one of the big editors...
over at the News America.
This man is running
the afternoon newspaper...
and his son is getting all fucked up...
doin' the dirt and getting high
down in Locust Point.
The deputy, who I guess
is in a favor-doin' mood...
sends word down to the major...
I'm supposed to make
the case without the fence.
Just the print hits and the statement.
Play it like that.
So, he's doin' this for what?
To have some newspaper guy in his pocket?
Yeah, I guess so.
Is this Burrell?
No, no, Mueller. Deputy Ops before Burrell.
So, what did you do?
What do you think I did?
I charged him with receiving,
then had his ass testify.
You could've made the case without him.
Just on the prints and the statements.
Probably, yup.
Why didn't you?
Why?
Why are you fuckin' up yourself
chasing Avon Barksdale?
A week after trial ends, Major comes to me...
asks me where I want to go.
I tell him, I don't care,
I like to be outside, you know?
Give me a goddamn foot-post...
I'll still make my money, you know...
send my ass up to Edmondson Avenue,
I don't give a shit.
You went to a foot-post?
Major come back,
asks me where I don't want to go.
And he asks it like
he wanna make sure I land okay.
So, I tell him, I don't want
no fuckin' paper-shuffle.
No office shit.
Send my black ass outside
and let me police somewhere.
Pawnshop unit.
They got me good.
So, why'd they let you out of the box?
Why now?
I guess they just forgot about me.
Shit, Lester.
You back from the dead?
You rolled away the stone.
Bunk Moreland says you're natural police.
One of the few.
Yeah, I've had my moments.
Detective...
when they ask you where you wanna go...
and they are gonna ask you
where you wanna go...
do yourself a favor...
keep your mouth shut.
I gotta take a tinkle, boy.
-I got it.
-All right.
Hello.
-Is Kima there?
-And you are?
Tell her it's McNulty.
For you, Kima,
a decidedly confused white boy.
God.
How'd it go today?
Lost him in the 221 .
Picked him back up in the low-rises...
and then lost him
on Schroeder Street after dark.
Nicely done.
-Are you okay to drive?
-Yeah, I'm fine.
I just wanted to thank you.
For what?
For today, you know, with Daniels.
-You should be thanking Lester.
-I did.
I just wanted to thank you, too,
Detective Greggs.
No problem. Good night.
That it is.
What'd I miss?
Nothin' much.
Lovelorn?
Worse. Lonely.
You didn't make it into class again today.
You said you'd stick with it.
I'm tryin'.
Things are hot right now.
I'm doing the best I can.
You said yourself,
you need to do somethin' else.
Somethin' better for us.
You promised.
Man.
What am I gonna do with you?
You know better women than you
have fallen for my tricks, right?
What have you got under this?
...the big fat morning show.
Now, you wanna play
the brand new big fat game:
big fat match game, call us now....
Hello?
Hello?
Who was that?
-They hung up without saying.
-They hung up without saying?
What you care?
You never use the damn phone
in here no how.
What's up, baby?
I need you to get
them phone lines up out that house.
Out of the apartment? Why?
I'm saying, what Chantay gonna say...
about not havin' no line in her own place?
All right. Got you.
What's up, baby, you got a problem?
-Good.
-I'm just sayin' though, man...
it seem we just goin' past careful, man...
with all of this, man.
Like we buggin' out or something.
You know, like we paranoid and shit.
Naw, I don't wanna use this phone.
We used this phone yesterday.
What you blowing out your mouth for, man?
You act like....
Ain't nobody out to get me, man.
I got no motherfuckin' enemies.
Naw, man.
We all right.
All right, this gonna be so easy...
them Eastside chumps,
they ain't nothing like Avon's people.
Watch, y'all gonna see.
All right, now y'all gonna be here, right?
Hold up.
Yo, Boo!
I'm gonna slide up through here.
Bailey, you gonna cover the alley.
Yo!
Yo, Maurice short, man.
-How short?
-Three.
Tell him to grow a couple of inches.
Where you gonna be at?
That be the trap right there, homes.
You figure they roll
through the alley for sure?
Man, rats always run
to holes in times of danger.
And you him, ain't you?
-Who?
-Danger.
Naw, man, I'm just a nigger
with a plan, that all.
And a shotgun.
For sure.
Sorry I'm late.
Got myself lost down the other hallway.
-That leads to the loading dock.
-Yeah, and deep storage.
So, this is where they put you?
Quite a message they're sending.
-Yeah, and that message is....
-Out of sight, out of mind.
Spoken like a true troglodyte.
Whole lot of dead trees
behind this nonsense.
The foundation of your case, Detective.
You lay it in right, you can build on it.
You lay it in wrong, everything on top falls.
We ready?
Do you solemnly swear and affirm
that the affidavit is true...
and accurate to the best of your knowledge?
-I do.
-I do.
Then by the power vested in me,
I now declare you man and wife.
-Did he swear already?
-The state's attorney?
Yeah.
I see it.
Second copy is sealed for the court,
and the police get the others.
How's this work?
Same frequency as the one
carried by D'Angelo Barksdale.
He gets a page, we get a page.
-So, we up now?
-It's official.
-You're up.
-Then let the game begin.
Celebrities always seem much smaller
when you meet them in person.
Yo!
Yo!
Check it out, here he come.
-Somethin' ain't right, yo.
-Watch out, man, he got that boom.
-He's packing.
-Here he come.
Yo, come on, Omar's coming, man!
Oh, shit!
Yeah...
the cheese stands alone.
-How you know?
-'Cause if you could, I'd have been had.
Yo, he saying you can't catch the bug...
just by getting your dick sucked.
Dumb-ass, you gotta be
in some pussy to get it, all right?
Man, wear a coat if you want,
don't nobody like suckin' on a rubber.
How would you know?
Who you trying to fuck anyway?
Arletta Mouzone. Treenee's cousin.
Damn, man, in that case
use a big-ass condom, all right?
You need a trash bag. Fuck that.
I wouldn't run up in that bitch
with D'Angelo's dick....
It's triflin'.
Easy to see why niggers come
around here stealing our shit!
Yo, you know what, nigger?
What?
Forget it.
142 isn't a working telephone exchange.
Six intercepts so far,
and five aren't working numbers?
Something wrong with the recorder?
We're getting what you'd expect,
seven digits of a telephone number...
and a two-digit add-on to identify the caller,
like here, 13.
McNulty, line one.
-Yeah.
-Did youjust get a 142 exchange?
Yeah, that's what we got, too.
-That's fucked up.
-All right, later.
He's got the same numbers
on the readout of the cloned pagers.
So it's not the recorder.
These mopes are using a code
to cover their calls?
-That's pretty damn sophisticated.
-What is?
They've coded the telephone numbers
in their pager messages.
How do you know?
Every time the Barksdale kid's pager
goes off...
this machine gives us a message and time.
McNulty's carrying a cloned pager,
but this is what we use in court.
Same with those pen registers.
Every time a pay phone
in the low-rise court is used...
we get the telephone number,
the time and the duration of the call.
Incoming calls, too.
Spy shit. Very cool.
You say they're using some kind of code?
Yeah, they got to be.
These numbers don't make no fuckin' sense.
-You rang?
-Omar's ride.
Bubbles spotted it.
Different tags, no stolen report,
these come back right for the van...
but Bubs makes it
by the cargo rack on the roof.
Good scope. You wanna take him?
Can't hurt to try.
We pop Omar, get a gun,
he might let us work him.
Anything coming through on the pager?
Eight hits so far,
most of them in some kind of code.
These ain't Baltimore exchanges,
that's for sure.
Three weeks to get Daniels to agree,
a week to write out the affidavit...
and then this bullshit.
How complex a code can it be
if these knuckleheads are using it?
Then again, what does it say
about us if we can't break it?
You wanna run Bubs back downtown,
I'll sit here and wait for you.
All right.
-What'd I miss, girlfriend?
-Not a goddamn thing.
Yeah, boring, ain't we?
How y'all do what you do every day
and not wanna get high?
That's what I be asking.
It's been a little hectic down here,
right, cuz?
String, man, I can't lie.
Them stick-up boys,
they caught us dead up.
And the knockos, shit,
I don't know what the fuck that was.
5-0. Comin' up!
-5-0 comin' up, y'all.
-Time-out.
-C'mon, man, what is that?
-What?
You gotta get your crew
to understand that...
it's the stick-up crews and the creepers...
that give us the most trouble.
When they start thinking like that...
you're not gonna have any more surprises,
you feel me?
'Cause you know, your uncle and me...
we think you got a snitch up in the shop.
-What?
-Someone who tips off the stick-up crew.
And you gotta be on that, right?
You gotta be on that.
I'm gonna tell you what you do.
What day is it today, Friday?
What happen on Friday?
-Payday.
-Not this Friday.
Why not?
No, what you gonna do
is you gonna call 'em...
Iike you gonna pay 'em
and then you crack 'em.
You tell 'em you're not happy...
with what they fuckin' pass
as work down here.
And when you're not happy,
they ain't gettin' paid. You feel me?
Yeah, but String, you don't pay a nigger,
he ain't gonna work for you.
What, you think a nigger's gonna get a job?
You think these niggers
gonna be like, "Fuck it...
"Iet me quit this game here
and go to college"?
Naw, they gonna buck a little,
but they not gonna walk.
-And in the end, you gonna get respect.
-Yeah.
And when that money run out,
they'll come up to you and roll on you...
And when that money run out,
they'll come up to you and roll on you...
and ask you for an advance and shit,
when they flat-ass broke.
Them the niggers
that you strike off your list.
But that nigger that stay eatin'...
the nigger that steady rollin',
ain't askin' you for shit...
that's the nigger I want
to hear about. Understand?
Yeah, man, shit, you know how
to play a nigger into a corner, String.
-Yo, take care of this right here.
-You my favorite girl.
Shit, let me handle this, man.
-Yo, Poot.
-Yeah, l--
-Come here, man.
-What's happening?
What the fuck is that? What the fuck is that?
You know the fuckin' rules.
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Copying.
A telephone.
This fucking detail is too much for me.
It's after 3:00.
So, where are the boys at?
Maybe they only come out at night.
I used to have a guy
like Omar working for me.
Guy named Reuben Terry.
Is he good?
Saw the street like we wish we could.
Ain't nothing like a good Cl.
School's out.
Can I use your cell phone?
Yeah, I got that. I did.
I know.
I don't know about this....
-What do you mean, you don't know?
-How can I trust you....
For chrissakes, Elena, I'm their father.
You think I'd let 'em sleep on the floor?
Yes, I got them.
Sheets, pillows, comforters, pillowcases.
I fuckin' got them.
What color are they?
Color, what the fuck do you care
what color they are? Hello?
-Lost her.
-I bet.
You know something?
My ex-wife, the way she acts sometimes,
the way she deals with shit...
you would think a less enlightened man
than myself, cruder man than myself...
a man less sensitized to the qualities
and charms and value of women...
a man like that, not me, but a man like that,
he just might call her a cunt.
You just called the mother
of your children a cunt.
No, I did not call her that.
-Yes, you fuckin' did.
-No, I did not.
Let's just leave this, okay?
I got some stuff to do.
5-0, gotta go.
Whoa, man, get out the way!
Shit.
Not much fighting this time.
You getting tired, asshole?
Still dragging from
the whupping Kima put on him.
Fucked you up like
a cop should, didn't she?
That's one thing about Kima,
she put a hurtin' on you like a man.
Get your monkey ass up.
You're gonna want your
business card back, right?
Come on.
From Bantry Bay to the Derry Quay
And from Galway to Dublin town
Well, I've never seen
My brown Colleen
That I met in the County Down
There's a man in the County Down
There's a man in the County Down
First, I go in, play nice.
-Then you come in, play bad.
-I ain't gonna be playin'.
Bracelet too tight?
You rackin' up all kinds of points, ain't you?
First, you put a cop in the hospital,
damn near kill his ass with that punch.
Now, you on the wing from Boys' Village.
Man, I'm 16, all right?
What the fuck they gonna do to me?
That's the least of your worries, my friend.
I got a partner outside who can't wait
to get in here and fuck you up.
Cop you banged was Herc's uncle.
Herc wants off the leash on this one.
And I suppose you
at the other end of that leash?
See, I don't want to play it that way.
I know about comin' up hard and all.
Why, you came up hard?
Flag House projects. Eastside.
Yeah, Flag House?
You know, you remind me of me.
I'm thinking we should work something out.
What do I get?
What you want?
I want....
for you to suck my dick.
I'll beat your fuckin' monkey ass.
You supposed to be the good cop,
dumb motherfucker.
What?
-Hello, may I help you?
-Yeah, we'd like a table.
And you have reservations?
Naw, I thought, you know,
we could just walk in....
Let me see what I got.
That's two?
Follow me, please.
Your coat, ma'am?
-Can we get that one, over there?
-It's Friday night...
those are for patrons
who made reservations.
Let me get your chair for you, ma'am.
-It's okay, man, all right.
-Here you are.
Here you are, sir.
Your waiter will be with you shortly.
You shoulda pushed him, Dee.
Bastards.
Sarge, nobody answers at juvenile intake
and we been calling.
Clearly, they're not
as dedicated as you two detectives.
So what time does
the duty intake consultant get here?
You missed the 8:00.
You got another one around midnight.
-Midnight?
-You think maybe if we left you...
the paperwork, you could put him
in the box 'til intake gets here?
Hemorrhoid.
For the crumbs.
Yeah, right.
-You like your dinner?
-Yeah.
-That shrimp was right.
-Yeah, it was good, right?
Think they know?
Do they know what?
You know. What I'm about.
What you mean, Dee?
Come on, you know, it's like...
we get all dressed up, right?
Come all the way across town.
Fancy place like this.
After we finished, we gonna
go down to the harbor.
Walk around a little bit, you know?
Acting like we belong down here,
know what I'm saying?
So? Your money good, right?
Dee, we ain't the only black people in here.
It ain't what I'm talking about.
It's about where we.... Come on, you know.
I'm just saying, you know,
I feel like some shit just stay with you...
you know what I'm saying,
like, hard as you try...
you still can't go nowhere,
you know what I'm saying?
-Can I interest you in dessert?
-Yes, thank you.
-Can I have some chocolate cake?
-I'll bring the cart.
Boy, don't nobody give a damn
about you and your story.
You got money,
you get to be whatever you say you are.
That's the way it is.
Sir, I'm sorry. These are the samples.
And for you, sir? Very good.
Don't be a bitch, admit it.
Go ahead.
-Admit you're wrong, be a man.
-Yeah, I gotta confess...
this sub beats chink-ass Bob's by a mile.
'Course, you might be all that when it comes
to thumpin' on niggers...
'Course, you might be all that when it comes
to thumpin' on niggers...
but you can't do shit with that stick, man.
-You'd do better.
-I play.
Says he plays.
He might.
I'm even better with two hands.
I checked it out, man.
Stinkum true on this one.
Except for that nigger, Scar,
from New York...
Edmondson gully is wide open.
What about Tee-Tee's crew?
Naw, them niggers dried up
when they took that federal charge.
Most of 'em laid up somewhere,
gettin' high and shit.
I'll tell you what. You holler at the boy Scar.
Let him know, man, it's time
for him to take a stroll.
If he give you any beef at all,
we'll put Wee-Bey and Bird on it.
-All right.
-And then once we got him outta there...
we'll send in the smokers to run out
all the little poop-butt locals and shit.
Or, if you think
there's some cats in there who got game...
-then we put 'em on our team.
-All right, who you want to run it?
-Send Stinkum up here.
-All right.
He the one who saw the shot.
So, he gets a shot.
All right, okay, not bad.
Can't let the duty officer see that.
You wanna give it a rest, man?
You down $60.
That might be your whole damn salary,
but I clock that shit in minutes.
-Rack 'em and break 'em, man.
-You the guys waiting for juvenile intake?
He's in the squad room.
If I had more time, I'd run you.
Give you a tip, Preston.
You gonna run a hustle,
you best stay with what you know.
Man, fuck you and your
tired-ass advice, all right?
But that sandwich was good.
You gonna move our little thing
down to Edmondson Avenue.
Take the gully.
What about Scar?
Who?
Listen, I'm giving you points
on the package...
so, you make a go of it, you hear me?
You working for yourself, too,
so you gonna put out the strong product...
and you gonna get the locals behind it.
It's as simple as that.
You get your team together, you feel me?
Go and wait for me downstairs.
I'll be down in a minute, man.
-We gonna make this money run in a few.
-Smile or something, nigger.
-Made that nigger's night.
-Yeah, he deserved it, though.
He deserved it.
It's Wee-Bey. We got one.
-You think it's Omar?
-Nah.
-It's one of the young 'uns, I think.
-One down, two to go, right?
Yeah, motherfuckers. Try to rob me, baby.
One, two, three.
-A winner.
-A match? Which case?
The one you just brought me, Bunk.
Casing in that girl shot up in Northeast.
-Kresson?
-Diedre Kresson, right, yeah.
She matches up with two other cases,
both from last year.
-Which ones?
-Toreen Boyle....
-Someone named Ligget. It's in the report.
-It's Toreen Boyd, Roland Leggett.
Yeah, them.
Casings from all three killings go to a .45,
probably Colt Classic.
-That fucker Landsman. How's he do it?
-You like Landsman for these three?
I don't know, Bunk.
As sergeants go, Jay's a sociopath and all,
but I'd have to go with an actual gangster.
Jimmy, you sitting down?
I said it was hot, but ifyou
got these barbecue gloves.
You got a Johnny Weeks up in here?
-Who?
-Johnny Weeks.
-Over in the game room.
-Obliged.
-Any smokes?
-I'm out.
How long have you been here?
You gotta give the medication...
a chance to work in your system, man.
Brought you something.
Yeah, some chicken pieces and some fries.
Bought you a shake,
but I dropped it on the bus.
It comes in a bag, goes out in a bag.
How long you have that for?
-I fucked up, man.
-Yeah, I saw.
-I fucked up, man.
-Yeah, I saw.
There was nothing I could do, you know?
It's like first I got beat, right, then I get this.
What are these for?
They say I got the bug.
The bug?
They checked me when
I was in the hospital--
Are they sure?
Where you been at?
Here and there, I'm at it.
I'd have come past sooner,
but I been on kinda like a mission.
-A mission?
-Yeah. Them hoppers that beat you down...
they got problems now.
Them and the people they sling for, even.
What?
I put the police on their ass.
Police?
-What, you get locked up or something?
-No, come on.
No, I'm not working for them.
I'm working with them.
They don't give me the badge soon enough,
I keep doing like I do.
Why?
What do you mean why?
How can you ask me why?
Why the fuck are you in here, man,
with all these falling-down motherfuckers?
Why you passing shit through a bag?
Why they beat you down?
Why I couldn't do nothing about it?
It's all part of the game, right?
I mean, you taught me that.
What you up to in here, man?
-Doing the meetings.
-N.A.?
Yeah. Twice a day.
That's good, man. It's good,
you give the body comfort, you know.
-Yeah.
-No, you needed a change.
Guess so.
I'll be getting out of here
the end of the month.
It's all right. They got meetings everywhere.
You ain't gotta worry about that.
Bubs.
Who's got the best package now?
-Get the fuck out of here, man.
-I'm coming home, right?
Shit is weak all over, you know?
Got some boys up in Baker
and Calhoun, though.
They had a smoker out
the other day though.
-Yeah?
-Knocked a couple of niggers out.
Ain't you a trip?
Beat down, bagged up,
still ready to rip and run, huh?
I'm a Viking, homes.
"I'm a Viking, homes."
McNulty.
There's something here that needs kissing.
Speak again, toothless one.
I guess you know now why I wear
the stripes in the family.
Good call, Jay. Of course, if Keeley
hadn't fucked the scene up...
you'd have had that casing
months ago, right?
Keeley. Let Keeley be Keeley.
We all can't be princes
of the city, now can we?
Speaking of which...
sit down.
May I ask you a question
that is essential to your career?
-What?
-Who do you serve?
I am asking you to identify for the record
your commanding officer.
-Major Rawls.
-Excellent.
And with that thought in mind, I advise you
to go immediately into the Major's office...
carrying the break
I've given you in the Kresson case...
and kiss the man's ring. Because...
I have talked you right out of the shithouse.
Here's the deal.
You wrap up this thing
with Narcotics in two weeks.
You put yourself back in the rotation
when we go back to night work.
You do that and you're back in the fold.
-Thanks, Jay.
-No problem.
Shit ain't right.
You work, you get paid.
That's what I'm saying.
I'm gonna say something to him, all right?
-You should.
-Truth.
-What's up, Dee?
-What's up, Shorty?
$530, the count is right, man.
Okay, re-ups on the way down.
Go tell Sterling to be ready for it.
All right. Yo, Dee, man.
You know, me and Poot,
we been steady working it, you know?
Nothing sloppy, no troubles, right?
No.
And we was wondering if, maybe you could
let a little something go...
until payday, 'cause you know, right now,
we some broke-ass niggers, man.
Right now, whoever did our girl...
also did Boyd and Leggett a month earlier.
-Leggett.
-And those two are definitely...
straight-up drug executions.
No mention of Dee in either file.
But I did get a fresh number...
-on Tywanda.
-Who?
The girl who called in on Kresson.
-Right.
-She put Dee in for that.
Have you seen this?
Jaybird.
And the bear said, "You didn't
really come here to hunt now, did you?"
-You see Saturday's 24s?
-Sunday morning.
Did you see the one Worden
got on the Westside?
John Bailey, in a Kevlar vest,
lit up by three separate shooters.
Carey Street.
You made the Kresson connection...
you didn't think Bailey might tie in
with Barksdale?
Worden's on the other shift.
I'm trying to work my murders, Jesus Christ.
Tony, Line 3.
What took you so long?
You might've heard, we get a few murders
here in Baltimore...
sometimes we just get backed up.
-You weren't followed here?
-Why would we be followed?
Diedre was playing with scary people.
Who might that be?
You called this in after the murder
and you told the detective...
that you talked to her
the night she was killed.
She called. It was late.
She didn't talk long, she said she had to go.
Dee was at the door.
And that was the last time
you spoke with her?
-Yeah, she was killed that night.
-Dee was her boyfriend?
No, Dee was his nephew or something.
Dee would be D'Angelo Barksdale.
And the boyfriend, Avon Barksdale?
And the boyfriend, Avon Barksdale?
You know Avon?
The question is how do you know him?
You out there running
the street with the players?
I used to be...
but not after this thing with Diedre.
I mean, damn.
We used to go to Odell's for ladies' nights...
and one time he was there with all
his people in one of the big booths...
ordering drinks,
acting like he was king of everything.
And Diedre ate that shit up.
-And you?
-I ain't gonna lie.
I did the club thing for a while, but...
some of those places,
everybody in there's on some kind of game.
But Diedre went with Avon?
She was with Avon for like a year...
and something happened. Toward the end,
she started getting real possessive...
and that didn't sit with Avon,
'cause he has other girls, too.
She started bitching on him one minute...
crying the next minute,
threatening to do all kinds of things.
-She threatened Avon Barksdale?
-The girl was off the hook.
One time, she threatened
to write a letter on him.
-A letter.
-A letter to the state's attorney.
Supposed to be some sort of kin to her.
She said that if he dumped her...
she was gonna tell about the drugs.
-Did she write this letter?
-I don't know.
I tried talking to her about the way she
was acting, but she wouldn't let it go.
She even had it out with him in his club
one night in front of all the people.
What, Avon has a club?
Orlando's, titty bar.
-Does he own it?
-That's what Diedre said.
She said he owned a whole mess of stuff.
-Tell me something, man.
-What's that?
How can you run this place
and not just OD on pussy?
Shit.
You try dealing with all these bitches
and their problems for a few days.
Get so you'd rather be running a goddamn
laundromat out this fucker.
Heard you're doing okay in the Pit.
-Yeah, well.
-What, you ain't getting it like that?
Man, my uncle
still got me working on salary.
Damn, boy.
You ain't the only one
your uncle keeps close.
What?
Come on, man, you ain't making no ends?
I know you getting
something on this by now.
No, man.
I'm just the front,
clean name for the liquor board.
-I'm saying--
-What the fuck?
Is there a problem?
That was for the drink before.
It was for this one.
It ain't like I'm calling your uncle out
or nothing...
but give a nigger a chance.
Plenty of pie out there for everybody.
Believe.
You heard Stinkum gonna be coming off
the clock, right? Getting a percentage.
-What?
-Open up fresh territory.
Take over the corners
down near Edmondson and Brice.
So, my uncle gave that to Stink?
Figured you knew.
Orlando!
Excuse me, Orlando,
can you help me down here, please?
-I already paid for that last drink.
-That was for the drink before.
-Hell, no, that was for this one.
-What's up here?
Look, he ain't paid for that drink
and I took $20 off the bar.
-Look she took $20, then $20 more.
-Hell I did.
Come on, now, why you
gonna do me like this?
I been with you for an hour and a half
buying drinks.
Look, man, this ain't right.
I just spent $1 20 in drinks, $40 in tips.
Now, you gonna take all that
and still try to sneak into my pocket?
-Shit, girl!
-You got to go, get him the fuck outta here.
I ain't done so much as touch your kneecap.
Trying to treat her with a little respect,
and this is the way you do me?
Wait, wait!
Why you do that?
-Did you take his money?
-No, I didn't take his money.
You buying me a drink?
Can I see you sometime?
Like, you know, not in here.
I don't usually see men that I meet in here.
Usually.
What kind of strip joint has
a video camera looking out?
More to it than the girls, maybe.
So, he's got the club,
he's got the warehouse...
he's got the apartment building
by Druid Hill Lake...
he's got the tow truck company...
and that's just what she knew from
what he bragged about to the dead girl.
-Major likes assets.
-The Deputy, too, I imagine.
Nothing like a few property forfeitures
to swell the departmental operation budget.
Check city assessments to see
who owns the club.
Run the company name through
the state corporate charter office.
Also, Homicide picked up one
Saturday night. Might be one of ours.
John Bailey, he's a stick-up artist
I used to know from the Murphy homes.
He was wearing Kevlar, but it didn't help.
39 casings on the scene,
from three different guns.
Overkill for a burn bag...
but about right if he was running with Omar.
Lookit, our buddy.
Just once, I wish they'd use
the right number.
Ain't like him to be late.
Bailey, you fucking dope fiend.
I'm telling you...
them fucking people ain't to be relied on.
Why you always gotta talk like that, man?
-What?
-"F" this and "f" that.
If I give it up,
I lose half of what I mean to say.
Don't nobody want
to hear them dirty words, man.
Especially coming from
such a beautiful mouth.
Wait for Bailey?
Early bird catches the worm, dog.
-I beeped you.
-I didn't get it.
-Let me see.
-You want to see my pager?
Sure, Prez, you want to see my pager?
-I beeped you too.
-You all right, Prez?
714-3432?
I got that. That was you?
You try it?
Yeah, I tried it. Twice.
Non-working number.
It would've worked if you knew the code.
Shit, I'm as surprised as you.
I like word-search puzzles.
You know, where you gotta
find the hidden words?
So, I thought I could do the same thing
with the numbers.
Take the number I sent you.
Now, take the seven
and jump it over the five.
You get three.
Jump the one over the five...
you get nine.
With four you get six.
Three, that's seven, four is six...
a three again...
and two is eight.
Zero switches with the five.
So 714-3432 is...
396-7678.
Our number.
And that's the code?
And it works, because it's all about
where the buttons are on a phone.
If it was a code that involved math...
or algebra or whatever...
these little yos in the projects
wouldn't be able to follow along.
But with this, all you gotta do
is jump the five button.
Ain't no math to it. It's just...
how a phone looks when you look at it.
Prez, you little genius!
-Jesus.
-I could kill you, that's so good.
Your mother keep ragging at me...
to take him outta here and put him
in a private nursing home.
You know, she ain't never gonna let that go.
I keep telling her, man, we can't show
this legit money yet, man...
especially since he ain't got no insurance.
Soon, though.
So, you ain't big on coming here, right?
No.
Tell you something, man...
you about to see your uncle,
you understand me?
-This is family.
-I know.
Family is what counts,
family is what it's about.
Family gonna always be there
'cause it's blood.
Man.
You never figured on this, did you?
Live the life, lead the life. Ain't no big thing.
He used to talk that shit all the time and he
believed it, you know what I'm saying?
What's up, baby, talk that shit now.
You know, you're right.
It's kind of hard to be in here right now.
He scare you, don't he?
-You know, I'm just saying--
-He scares me.
See, if he dead, you know,
I could carry it better.
Coming up the way we did,
you kind of expect that.
Waiting on it.
See...
the thing is, you only got to fuck up once.
Be a little slow, be a little late. Just once.
And how you ain't gonna never be slow...
never be late?
You can't plan for no shit like this, man.
It's life.
Scares me.
They're still using it.
I was by on Saturday night and it was gone.
On your own time?
You still getting your boys?
Yeah, tonight for a sleep-over.
Omar's rolling.
What the hell?
Call for backup?
Not yet.
Let's see how it plays out.
An invitation.
Feel a little lonesome for backup.
Yeah, me, too.
That's nice.
-I'll check the rear.
-I'll watch the boys.
Afternoon, gentlemen.
Saying, if you were gonna use that
you would've been done using it by now.
It's clean.
Got to keep it clean.
We having one of our little parlays like this,
got to keep it clean, right?
Omar with no gun on the street?
Must be a first.
Yeah, sometimes
who you are is enough, dog.
But being as y'all sitting on my ride so long,
I thought I'd save y'all some time.
Come straight on out.
I ain't taking no charge.
You ain't putting me back in no cage.
We're not here to bury you, Omar.
We're pulling you up 'cause
we got a problem in common.
-Problem?
-Barksdale.
-No, he ain't no problem.
-I don't know.
Avon's been chalking up a lot of bodies.
And you being you....
Put it that way,
I guess he could be a little problem...
but I just can't really come out
and help you all.
You know what I mean?
Snitchin' just rubs me wrong.
Personally, I don't think
the game is played like that.
We respect that.
If you do happen to take a charge though...
I'm McNulty, that's Greggs.
You give us a call, we'll sort something out.
Fair enough.
You know, I used to work the homes,
back when your brother was up there.
You get a chance...
Iet him know they blew up
John Bailey last night.
Good man.
Lot of enemies.
Saying, you trying to catch up with Bird?
Word is he dropped a workin' man.
Wait, hold up. Come on, don't play me.
What workin' man, what Bird?
Come on, now,
ain't but one working man, now, is there?
And Bird?
I think your snitch can handle that.
Shit, Bubbles know Bird.
You working late?
A little.
Got a minute?
Sure, have a seat.
No, this is better said standing up.
You know, I've been 13 years on the shelf.
I ain't bitched.
It was me that put me there.
But I'm here now, and I gotta say a piece.
We should've had a tap
on the project pay phones by now.
A wire there will get us the drugs.
Keep pushing,
we'll get a whiff of the money, too.
I know you're serious
about climbing that career ladder...
and I know how slippery
it gets the higher you go...
but for me...
I don't want to go to no dance
unless I can rub some tit.
I appreciate your honesty.
Good night, Lieutenant.
So, what you say to make Dee pay out?
I told him to give it up
or I'm taking him out of the count.
-Shit.
-Look.
I'll pump niggers when I got to.
-That's him.
-That's who?
One of the ones that robbed us.
That light-skinned boy.
That's him?
All right, come on.
I'm the king of this shit.
-So, you want us to wait?
-Yeah.
-All right, we on it, man.
-All right.
There goes Scar right there.
Right there in the blue?
-Number 80?
-Yeah, I'm on him.
All right, you got him?
-Find a phone real quick.
-What's wrong?
It looks like my man Dee
got himself an emergency.
What, he been stuck up again?
What's up, what do you need?
My people are onto one of Omar's
boys down at Greek's.
Word? All right, sit tight.
I'm gonna take care of it.
All right.
Ain't nobody coming.
Dee said wait.
Dee said wait.
Told you.
-He still in there?
-Yeah, he's playing the games.
All right.
You are sharp, son. What's your name?
-Wallace.
-Wallace, all right.
This nigger's gonna
point him out to us, all right?
Yeah.
It's done. Nice work, cuz.
All right.
Rise and shine! Come on, man, get up!
Oh, boy. Come on, get up!
School day. Y'all gonna be late!
Let's go. Get up for school.
Go! Get up. Come on, man.
-Damn, Wallace.
-"Damn, Wallace," nothing!
Y'all know what happens
if you don't go to school?
Soon enough, they're gonna be callin'
and all y'all gonna end up in foster care.
If y'all want foster care,
climb your little black asses back into bed.
Get outta my way, man.
Damn, it's too early for this shit.
-Narcos?
-No, rollies.
Yo, where's breakfast at?
Here, man. You get two.
-I want two bags.
-You don't get two.
Come on, getting greedy. Take the chips!
Come on. Take your juice.
Come on, man.
Where's mine?
Go show your teacher. Come on, man.
-Where's your book bag?
-Teacher ain't giving no homework.
That's the worst case of suicide
I've ever seen.
That's him.
You see?
That's him, right there.
That's Omar's boy.
-What the fuck can I tell him?
-Whatever the man wants to hear, Jimmy.
Prodigal son.
Major, we got a good shot
at clearing a couple of cases here.
-One--
-We're not here to talk cases.
I don't care about your cases. Sit.
Relax.
I'm a reasonable guy.
In fact, everywhere I go, people say to me:
"Bill Rawls, you are a
reasonable fucking guy."
-Am I right, Jay?
-You are reasonable, sir.
Yes. Yes, I am.
And because your sergeant knows me
to be reasonable...
he came in here a couple weeks ago
and reasoned with me. Right, Jay?
We reasoned. We did.
We reasoned that
despite his negligible lrish ancestry...
and a propensity to talk out of turn,
Jimmy McNulty is a good worker.
Probably worth saving.
-Major, I'm not--
-He's a good-looking kid, huh?
Do you know what we do here, McNulty?
What we do here?
That was one of them.... What is it?
A question you don't have to--
A rhetorical question.
You were being rhetorical.
Rhetorical and reasonable, sir.
We work murder cases here,
as they come in, one at a fucking time.
It's called a rotation.
You're up till you catch one,
then you step down, work it for a while...
someone else steps up.
It's a simple but effective way
to do business...
in a town that has 250 to 300 cases a year.
Yes, sir.
But if someone gets it into his head
to leave the rotation...
it puts an unfair burden on other detectives
who have to pick up their casework.
Overworked cops make mistakes.
Mistakes lower the unit-wide clearance rate.
And that can make someone
who is otherwise as reasonable as me....
Unreasonable.
Detective McNulty, I expect to see
your ass back here next week...
when your shift rotates to night work.
-He's up early today.
-A lot of pager activity last night, too.
No woman takes that long.
Yeah. But I look good, right?
Wow. You did all this?
-Burned an egg or two. Ain't no thing.
-Yeah?
My mama always said:
"Don't let them get to cooking.
"Once they're in the kitchen, ain't nothing
left to do but give 'em a key to your house."
I don't want no key. I don't want no house.
And your mama don't know shit about me.
Looks just like you.
Yeah, he do.
Where's his mother?
Around the way.
Yeah. You friends?
You know, she want a key...
she want a house, she want a car,
she wants some new clothes, a necklace...
some pocket change, a trip to the shore,
she want a credit card with her name on it.
Ain't no such thing as free, right?
When it come to pussy, there ain't no free.
I gotta go.
Been working on this one.
You'll get the lines
on the other two payphones tomorrow.
-So we up?
-On the low-rise payphones, yeah.
Let's hear it.
See, what I'm talking about is he ain't
paid no one, hejust think it's right to do it.
See how it goes?
So I ain't got shit. I ain't got it.
Damn, for real?
Thinking he all that
because he got his family back.
-Hey, it was getting good.
-It's unmonitored.
It's what?
Unmonitored. We can't listen to a
conversation on an unmonitored payphone.
-What's that mean?
-We got a tap on the courtyard payphone.
By tomorrow,
we'll be up on two near the high-rises.
But we can't listen to anything unless we
know one of our targets is using the phone.
So we gotta be out there
on those rooftops for hours...
watching these assholes talk on the phone?
Yep.
It's more bullshit.
Detective, this right here, this is the job.
Now, when you came downtown to CID,
what kind of work were you expecting?
So what are you gonna do?
I can't get back here in a week,
this case is taking off.
You tell Rawls that?
-No.
-McNulty, Line 3.
Yeah?
Where at?
800 block, in the rear. Yeah, I got it.
Thanks. Yeah.
We're still waiting on a lab unit.
Do you have an ETA?
Negative. They're all out.
-Damn dog got Norris, too.
-You didn't think to warn me?
Too much fun not to.
Damn.
Is he one of yours?
We found him with Kevlar,
like the one Worden caught last week.
-We thought it might be a connection.
-Yeah, it connects.
How so?
Don't have a name,
but he's part of a stick-up crew.
Don't have a name,
but he's part of a stick-up crew.
Took off a stash house last month.
My guy, Barksdale, is coming back on them.
-In a big way.
-They must've killed him four or five times.
Cut him in a dozen places, burned him
with cigarettes. Torture-fest is what it was.
Doesn't look like your scene, either.
Fuck him up somewhere else,
dump him here for all to see.
-Anything we can use?
-Not yet.
We're up on some phones.
If I hear anything, I'll let you know.
-Bring 22.
-22.
Anything yet? Or are we just gonna let
this guy go ripe on us?
-You been waiting for crime lab?
-Over an hour.
Only two units on the street. Both are up
at the City Council President's house.
-What happened there?
-Someone stole his lawn furniture.
They're taking pictures of an empty patio,
dusting the backyard gate for latents.
I kid you not.
I swear, you show me the son of a bitch
who can fix this police department...
I'd give back half my overtime.
He was all cut up and shit.
His insides was hanging out.
Fucked up, yo. I mean, damn.
Sometimes you gotta send a message, yo.
I mean, when you picked up that phone,
what did you think they were gonna do?
-All that shit is in the game. You know that.
-Yeah.
Like you and that girl, huh?
-What girl?
-The one in the apartment.
The one you told us about, remember?
I mean, I like what you said
about all that killing, you know?
Especially that part about
how it ain't gotta be like that.
Just sell the shit and move on.
Get me a ginger ale
and get something for yourself.
Yeah, I remember that.
But it ain't like that, is it?
Yeah, I know. I know it ain't.
Thing about it was his eye.
His eye was blown out.
And the other one was open.
And yo, Dee, it fucks me up.
It's like he's looking out,
like he sees everything, you know?
Don't think about it.
-Fuck!
-Yo.
Let that shit go.
Just let it go.
Barksdale kid on the line.
He's beeping someone.
-Yo.
-What up?
Hold on.
Yo, Strings! This is Dee.
-Yeah.
-Yeah, you hit me?
Yeah, I wanted to know ifyou know a
young hopper, the one they got down there.
-Which one?
-The fool, drop in there with a punch.
-Yeah, what about him?
-He got some problems, right?
-What you mean?
-Enough to bring home, right?
You know, man, whatever.
All right.
They're bringing Bodie home.
A young boy who was with him,
light-skinned kid from the cemetery.
Where?
In the alley behind 800 block of Argyle,
across from the low-rises.
Shot?
-Stabbed, beaten, burned.
-Jesus.
-Yeah, we gotta get with Omar.
-Yeah.
Impressive.
I don't often see a respondent come so
prepared for a juvenile commitment meeting.
In addition to the signed statements
from Preston's sponsors...
at the Police Athletic League...
I also have a Photostatted copy
of a cashed check...
which indicates that he is enrolled
in the GED program...
at the Baltimore City Community College.
Can I ask how this young man is able
to afford not one...
-but two attorneys from your firm, Mr. Levy?
-This is pro bono, Your Honor.
My firm is making it a priority to identify
a number of city youths...
who are in crisis, and to undertake efforts
to reorder their lives.
Excuse me, I can't help but notice that
your client is under a delinquent petition...
for the sale of narcotics, and further,
for assault on a police officer.
Beyond that,
he walked away from a JSA facility.
You Honor, my client stands
ready to acknowledge...
that he was involved for a time
in the sale of a small amount of drugs...
a transaction for which
he received no remuneration...
having been manipulated
by older traffickers in his neighborhood.
-That was a mistake, Your Honor.
-So noted.
We will contend that it was Preston who
was the victim of a brutal police beating...
indications of which
are still evident on him, Your Honor.
He struck back,
wildly and in self-defense, Your Honor.
And the walk-away?
Preston was heavily medicated
when he left the Cheltenham facility.
In that state, Your Honor...
he was simply trying to get back
to see his grandmother.
Did you know what you were doing
when you left the Boys' Village, son?
-No, I was messed up.
-Anything else you'd like to add?
Just...
I don't know...
I'm ready to be good.
Pending a hearing on these charges
to be scheduled within six months...
I'm putting the respondent
on home monitoring with his grandmother.
Your honor, I'm afraid Mrs. Brodus
doesn't have a telephone...
for any monitoring calls.
She's on a fixed income, Your Honor.
How about he calls his probation officer
twice a week?
Cool. Whatever...
Your Honor.
-Yo, Bubbles, what's the game?
-Hey, Johnny.
-Rubbing them down, huh?
-Yeah.
-Rubbing them down, huh?
-Yeah.
-What is the scam out here?
-Ain't no scam.
Thank you, ma'am.
What you got here is an honest day's work
for an honest day's pay. Right, Lavelle?
Mr. Straight Time, Bubbles.
Gotta give something back
when they least expect it.
Me and Uck, here, we got something on, too.
We got a plan.
-No shit.
-For real.
Yo, we're gonna take off
on the copper house.
Damn, your first two days out
and you get dramatic on me.
-Copper house.
-Got to be got, homes.
-What about the fence?
-Fuck the fence.
-What about the dog?
-Fuck the dog.
All that time I was resting,
it got me thinking. It got good to me, too.
Copper house. Gracious.
I gotta go, can you cash me out?
If you ain't got dreams, Bubs,
what the fuck you got?
Thank you. Come on, dreamer.
Yeah.
-One of ours on the line.
-Got him.
-Is Carv still there?
-Hold a second.
Carv, call for you!
-Yeah, hello?
-You ain't gonna believe who I'm looking at.
Again he walks off?
Ding! Round three.
-Yo.
-What up, man?
-Yo, Stink, what up?
-Where are your manners, fool?
-Oh, my bad, yeah.
-You need to keep your fucking head, boy.
Forgot.
-What's up? Where you at?
-Where you at?
I'm down in the Pit. Ijust came home...
I don't see nobody around,
ljust wanted to know what was up.
Ain't nothing going late, man.
Just catch us tomorrow, man.
-All right?
-All right, yeah.
All right. Later.
"Non-pertinent"?
How do you log that non-pertinent?
No drug talk.
They use codes
that hide their pager and phone numbers.
And when someone does use a phone,
they don't use names.
And if someone does use a name,
he's reminded not to.
All of that is valuable evidence.
-Of what?
-Conspiracy.
Conspiracy?
We're building something here, detective.
We're building it from scratch.
All the pieces matter.
All right?
Shit.
Shit!
Are you fucking serious?
Fuck, man.
You keep walking away from JSA,
we keep kicking your ass.
-I'm all right with that if you are.
-I ain't walk away from nowhere, man.
Check my back pocket.
-"Home monitoring"?
-Yeah, man.
If you ask questions before you start wildin'
on niggers, you might save some trouble.
How the fuck are you home?
You ain't bright, man.
Juvenile judge, man.
He saw my potential.
He expects big things from me.
Yeah, like what?
I don't know, college, law school,
medical school, all that good shit.
-Seriously, how are you out?
-Look, I'm gonna tell you something.
Okay, this is just my opinion, but...
the juvenile system in this city is fucked up.
It's a big-ass fucking joke. No offense.
Fucking fuck!
You could give me a ride down
to my grandma's, we'll call it even.
In back, fucknuts.
Get outta the street!
Bitch!
-Hey.
-Hey.
What's up? What you need?
-Little late in the month for this shit, isn't it?
-What you mean?
-For my aunt, she hit the Match Four.
-You stealing from me, Cass?
What?
You look fresh today.
-Got laid last night, that's why.
-Oh, yeah? Your asshole still hurting?
-Call Jimmy.
-What's up, boss?
Rawls finally got around to reading the
office reports that McNulty tried to give him.
He wants arrest warrants
for Diedre Kresson...
and the two project murders
that match up to that gun.
I know.
-Come on, Jay, be right on this.
-I can't. It's Rawls, he wants warrants today.
All right, no problem. So who the fuck
are we supposed to charge?
You got a witness
that puts D'Angelo Barksdale...
at the scene of the murder,
the night of the murder.
You got a ballistics match between
the Kresson girl and the two dead mopes...
in the project where Barksdale hangs.
Run with it.
This weak-ass shit
is not gonna get past the Grand Jury.
Charge the mope,
and work it more afterward.
Call Jimmy, let him know.
Yo.
All right, listen up. New deal.
Wallace, you're gonna be on the stash now
with Latroy and Peaches.
What about Sterling?
He's gonna be down on Crescent,
looking out for a while. Cassandra, too.
-What happened?
-Nothing.
-Why you wanna change up, then?
-Nigger, I gotta explain shit to you now?
Stringer Bell's pager number?
-Stinkum's too, I'm pretty sure.
-Very sweet.
If they moved around,
then nobody would have problems.
They're a little lazy, you know...
tend to go to that one payphone
in the courtyard a little too much.
Jesus.
He's lit at 9:00 in the morning?
Or from the night before.
Detective.
Detective Polk.
Yeah, it's McNulty. Bunk paged me.
All right.
Why did you even come in today?
-I had some....
-To pretend that you were here?
To fill out a run sheet?
I know I missed a couple of days
last week, Lieutenant, but--
I got a run sheet from you every day
for the last two weeks.
Twice in Carv's handwriting,
twice it was Prez, once it was McNulty.
They covered for you.
But I won't.
Well, Lieutenant, l....
I don't know. I'm not really
up for this drug thing, you know?
Maybe if Mahone was here, I could...
get into it more, learn some new tricks.
Hell, why don't you just send me back
to Property and keep everyone happy?
Send you back to Property Crimes
so you can binge for two more weeks?
I'm not doing that.
-Lieutenant, please--
-You were dumped on me, Augie.
But it ends there. I don't dump people.
You either go out on those rooftops today
to watch payphones with the others...
or you go over to the medical office
and check yourself in.
-Medical?
-For alcohol abuse.
Either dry yourself out
or go up on those rooftops wet.
Take a few minutes and think on it.
-Where'd they go?
-Who?
Lieutenant...
we need a file cabinet or two.
The paperwork from this, I mean...
there's a lot of it.
Lieutenant...
sir...
I'm going to....
Good luck with the case.
Fucking Rawls,
he's fucking up the case to get to me.
No, he's fucking it up for three paper
clearances on prior cases. It ain't personal.
All he's got is D'Angelo
at the scene through hearsay...
and a ballistics match to a couple unrelated
drug murders. How can he charge that?
He can charge anything he wants
to get credit for clearance.
Grand Jury doesn't indict,
he drops the case, keeps his stats.
-I'll go tell him what the fuck he can do.
-No you don't.
I'm trying to build something here.
Rawls just sticks a finger in my eye.
-You talk to Landsman?
-Jay can't fix this.
Rawls told him to have the warrants typed
and ready by morning.
He's gonna charge murders he can't prove
just to get the stats?
And fuck up our case in the process.
We give up ballistics info and motive
for the Kresson killing...
in the charging documents,
and Avon Barksdale is gonna change up.
And what he don't change up he'll clean up.
Someone should tell Rawls.
Rawls couldn't care less.
He wants me home, and the stats, that's all.
-Then we take it to Daniels.
-Daniels?
-It's his case, he'll fight for it.
-He won't do shit.
He plays stiff every now and then,
but he's a good man.
Are you kidding me?
He's been trying to put the brakes on this
for weeks now.
This'll be his new excuse to close shop.
Look, you guys gotta make your move soon,
I'm sorry to say.
-Freamon.
-All right, Bunk, take care.
We tell Daniels.
Fuck Daniels and his ass-kissing
up-the-chain-of-command ambition.
What other choice you got, huh?
We go to Daniels. If he fights, he fights.
If he gives it up to Rawls, then fuck it,
we were never gonna do the case anyway.
All right, come on.
Fucking idiot!
-Come on, get up, stupid.
-I'm hurt, man.
What are you doing? Leave me alone!
-What, are you on dope or something?
-Mostly, yes.
Come on, get up.
You trying to rip out my guts?
-Fuck.
-What, are you trying to kill me, man?
-Wait! Where are you going?
-Listen, I gotta get help.
You can't leave me here.
You gotta stay with me.
Let's go over to the curb.
Just go get help, man! What are you doing?
Stay there!
-Damn, boy! What the hell come out of you?
-Onion soup. Campbell's.
-Yeah, my plan!
-Run, Forrest, run!
You could go to Foerster,
or the Deputy Ops.
Why come crying to me?
Why not go to your friend, the judge?
I don't see a circuit court judge
being able to argue...
the city homicide commander
out of three murders...
even if the cases are all weak sisters.
It's put-up or shut-up time, Lieutenant.
-Either you step up or you send us all home.
-So this is on me?
I don't see anyone else
in charge of this detail.
-Rawls is a major.
-Rawls is an asshole.
My point is, he ranks me on this.
Chain of command might mean
nothing to you, McNulty.
What'd I tell you?
-Yo, how we doing?
-We doing good.
You know, if you say we doing good....
So the word is out
about these stick-up boys, right?
Yeah, y'all being heard.
There goes shorty right there.
What's up, man, you know...
I'm a man of my word.
I said it would be $4,000 to Omar...
$2,000 on each of the young ones,
this being a team effort.
I'm putting $500 in the boy's hand
who's doing the scope...
$500 in your hand for doing the relay...
put $500 in Wee-Bey and Bird's hands
for doing the muscling up.
-All right.
-How you doing with that other thing?
What?
Everybody a little depressed, right?
Oh, yeah, you know, ain't no surprises yet.
Cut everybody loose on Friday...
and they all just a bunch
of begging-ass bitches.
I mean, ain't nobody showed
no money since.
-You gonna keep it humming, cuz?
-Yeah, you know.
Oh! You got your hands up.
You keep on doing like how you're doing
we'll talk about points on the package.
-All right?
-All right.
-Keep it humming.
-Yeah, most def.
-All right, then.
-Take it light, but take it.
Hotter than the Wu-Tang, killer bee.
-40 cents.
-Not 40 cents a foot, no sir.
Look, respectfully, I gotta tell you...
for 40 cents a foot, you might as well
go to Home Depot, pay them.
They're gonna charge you
45 or 50 cents a foot.
For copper that isn't stolen.
Look, all right, 35 cents a foot.
And that's in respect I have for y'all,
what you're doing in our community...
with these quality domiciles here.
Thirty cents a foot, take it or leave it.
I understand the interest
in clearing these cases, I do.
But charging those murders now...
and putting the information that we have
into the charging documents....
I just call them like I see them, Lieutenant.
Three murders, same gun, we got this
Barksdale kid right at the scene on the one.
We're up on the wire.
We're starting to pull good information.
You charge these prematurely
and Barksdale will change up on us.
-The work we've already done--
-Look...
I can't tell you how to run your case,
I can only run my own.
Major...
I'm asking as a favor.
-As a favor.
-Yes, sir.
A favor.
In that case...
no. Sorry.
-You got home from work early today.
-Yep. Work sucks.
-Are we eating dinner with you?
-Why not?
-You promised we'd eat lasagna.
-So we'll go to Little ltaly.
Get some lasagna at Sab's.
-You never cook.
-Yeah, cooking sucks, too.
-Who's this?
-Hey, yo, I wanna see him.
-Who?
-Brandon, my boy.
-Copper house, yo.
-Was the shit.
My plan, Bubs.
Johnny had a plan.
Get out the way, motherfuckers.
This here is White Boy Day.
-I got a plan, too.
-What?
We're gonna wait for that cheap-ass,
speculating motherfucker...
to put that good copper line
back into them row houses he's fixing up.
Then, before the drywall get up...
we creep back in there,
and steal that shit right back.
30 cents a foot.
Gotta come back at the motherfucker
for that, you know?
Yeah.
You good?
I could top off with one more.
-Yeah.
-Just one more.
Johnny got it.
I'll be back.
It's my night with the kids.
You ain't gonna find nothing,
because I didn't do nothing!
Why don't you just leave me alone, man?
A white man can't walk down the street?
What's that about? Come on, man!
It's messed up, all right?
Profiling!
What? It's 'cause I'm white, right?
Why don't you let me....
Oh, man, what the fuck's that? What's that?
That boy ain't got no luck.
All right. Hold up!
-Hey.
-Hey.
So, what are you going to do
with your money?
You know what you should do?
Take the whole roll
and do something nice for your girl.
You do have a girl, right?
Anyway, you've got enough money
to go get yourself one now.
Why'd you punk Sterling like you did?
I mean, he did get shot behind this shit.
-I didn't punk him.
-So why are you dropping the lookout?
Cass, too.
'Cause they was thieving. Both of them.
They got pissed
'cause I wasn't paying them.
So Sterling started shaking up the vials,
handing off to Cass.
She was selling on the side.
You didn't tell anybody? Stinkum, Bodie?
They don't know?
If I tell them,
what you think they're going to do?
They're going to take a baseball bat
to Sterling. Cassandra, too.
It's too much drama, right?
So, I just took them both off the stash.
So why didn't you pay us?
That wasn't right.
Listen, man...
Stringer thought we had a snitch down here.
You know, with the jump-out,
Omar, all that shit.
So he told me to punk you all
for a little while.
See who was still holding money
at the end of the week.
Was they snitching?
Sterling and Cass?
No, man, just thieving.
2-0, Orioles, in the first inning.
All right, going to Homicide.
Okay, you two, you sit right here, okay?
Don't wander off.
-Dad?
-What?
It's a school night. Mom said we had to--
I know, I know. We will. Just stay there.
Runners at second and third,
nobody out yet here in the first inning.
Here's Mora at the plate,
and the pitch is high.
Lopez on the mound. The pitch is outside.
15 pitches and 10 of them have been balls.
It's a ground ball down the right-field line.
64-Charlie to Central K.
You up to this?
Pay it back, Omar. Pay it back.
Why we ain't in a real police office?
We're a little like you, Omar.
Out here on our own,
playing the game for ourselves.
Hard way to go sometimes.
Sorry about your friend.
Avon is one sick bastard.
Of course, he had his reasons.
For one thing, you all did take his stash.
For another, he's looking for you, Omar.
That's what all the cigarette burns
were about.
The broken fingers and cracked forearms.
He wanted your boy to give you up.
An address, a street.
Kid had heart.
Yeah.
I know you want to go to
wherever it is you lay your head...
and pick up that sawed-off you like
so much, and go on the hunt.
That's how a man like you wants to carry.
-You wouldn't be wrong.
-No, you wouldn't.
But one man with two barrels
ain't enough, Omar.
Now, you're going to do
what you're going to do.
But whatever else you can give us
on Barksdale and his people...
that can go to hurting him, too.
Just throw us what you can.
Let me tell you all something, all right?
What I do, I do, straight like that.
Ain't no sense
in you all troubling yourselves over that...
'cause the way I feel right now, today....
What do you all need from me?
When did you last see Brandon?
Tuesday around 7:00. Maybe later.
He was on his way down to Mindamin...
and the Greek's after that.
Everybody's talking about
he got snatched up from there.
The Greek's on Baltimore Street?
Yeah, he liked to play
the pinball games to death.
He go alone?
Yeah, and I didn't like it none, neither.
But you can only treat a young man
like a boy for so long before they book.
When Bailey got killed...
you must have figured
Barksdale was coming back on you?
Bailey? Please.
That nigger's enemies got enemies.
I just figured he tried his hand
on the wrong corner and got dropped.
But you were worried about Brandon, right?
Look, in my game...
you take some kid,
you play it the safest way you can.
But it ain't about no hiding forever.
You heard?
Frankly, you been in it as long as me...
you do the thing on your name.
Anyone going to come after Omar,
they know Omar's coming after him.
Oh, indeed.
So, who came after Brandon?
I heard it might have been Wee-Bey...
his boy Stinkum...
and Bird.
He was down with the snatch, too.
So, what can you give us on the job?
7:56 Tuesday night,
you had an incoming call...
to D'Angelo Barksdale's,
giving him the number of a pay phone.
Westside exchange.
Number's encoded, right?
Three minutes later, we get another call
from the low-rises to that number.
Then, a half-minute later,
you get another call from the low-rises...
to a pager we know is Stringer Bell's.
I'll be damned.
Finally, you get another call.
Probably from a pay phone.
Probably Stringer Bell calling back.
Coming on into the low-rise courts.
Forty-five minutes later, another call.
This one from the same pay phone
that went to D'Angelo's pager...
to start the whole thing off. You see that?
This is the murder, right here.
This first number,
the one they sent to D'Angelo...
I'm thinking this comes from a pay phone
over by the Greek's.
He's on you.
We're up on those pay phones
Tuesday night...
we catch that murder.
We get there before the murder.
It's all here on the pen register.
This one calling that one,
that one calling back.
We're up on those pay phones
when we should be, and we have him cold.
But we're not up in time, are we?
In this case,
we're never where we need to be.
Bad time for you all?
He fight, but you arrest.
You saw him get arrested?
-On Tuesday?
-Tuesday, yes. Tuesday.
By the police? The police arrested him?
Cops, they handcuffed him?
What about these guys?
Were they there with him?
No.
-He fight, you arrest.
-Right.
Okay, thank you, sir. Thank you.
It's a match.
No.
I need help. Rawls ranks me.
Lieutenant, think what you're doing here.
You're going to cross Bill Rawls...
as ruthless a fuck
as we have in this department?
And to do what?
To fight for a case the Deputy of Operations
doesn't even want.
No.
I like my career, thank you very much.
In the cemetery, you were telling us that
a guy named Bird killed the working man.
Yeah, the man who testified.
William Gant. Right.
Yeah, Bird did that one, for sure.
-How do you know?
-Everybody knows, man.
Nigger walked up behind the man
and shot him in the head.
The whole blessed project saw that much.
And Bird worked for Avon?
Yeah, as one of his shooters.
Liked to use this real sweet gun he got.
A .380 from Austria or Australia.
Something like that.
But I know he loved that gun.
A .380.
Yeah, a .380. You get him, you get the gun.
'Cause Bird's too dumb
to throw a gun like that off.
-A gun alone ain't enough.
-Oh, no?
He testifies he bought the gun on the street
after Gant was killed.
-What would be enough, then?
-Eyeball witness.
Some kind of corroboration
for what you're telling me here.
-Okay.
-Okay, what?
-I'm your man.
-You saw the murder?
Yeah.
You can ID this man, Bird,
as the shooter of William Gant?
And you ain't afraid to go into court...
and testify against
one of Barksdale's people?
Omar don't scare.
The fact is that while Lt. Daniels
and his merry band are lost in the swamps...
playing with beepers and pay phones
and body mikes...
my people have developed information
that ties Barksdale to three killings.
-D'Angelo Barksdale, not Avon.
-D'Angelo on behalf of Avon.
The victim is identified by our witnesses
as being involved with Avon Barksdale.
Sir, we're developing--
You're dancing around this thing.
I'm charging three murders.
You charge those cases,
my investigation folds.
Not one of those cases is strong enough
for court. You know that.
So we bring the Barksdale kid in...
throw a little mindfuck at him
and the case becomes stronger.
You've had him in the box twice before.
He's gonna go for less the third time.
So we re-canvass, develop fresh witnesses.
The case I charge on today
can be twice as strong by the trial date.
We get a conviction...
we roll Little Boy Barksdale
into Big Boy Barksdale...
then we go home...
Iike good old-fashioned cops
and pound some Budweiser.
This is bullshit!
It was McNulty who made
the ballistics match on these murders...
and he's telling me to fight this.
He knows you don't have
a viable prosecution...
so do you, so do l.
Enough.
Look, I've got no love
for your wiretap, Lieutenant.
I'm spending $2,000 a day...
over the unit operating budget
to staff the case.
over the unit operating budget
to staff the case.
Now, Major Rawls here
is offering a chance...
to leverage Barksdale
through a murder prosecution.
Why not jump on this?
Because if Major Rawls is right...
then he will be just as right
a month from now.
If the wire doesn't give us a case,
he can charge all the murders he has.
We lose nothing.
But if he's wrong...
if he can't convict,
or if the Barksdale kid doesn't flip...
then it's too late to do anything else.
Avon Barksdale changes up his pattern,
and the wiretap dies.
At that point,
there isn't going to be a thing...
that you, or me, or Rawls here
is gonna be able to say to that judge.
You wanted to see me, Major?
McNulty does personal business
on the clock, I want to know.
He cheats on a run sheet, I want to know.
He runs any kind of game at all,
I want to know.
Major, the man's an asshole...
but he doesn't do much other than work.
He's got this case in his gut like it's cancer.
He does no wrong?
Doesn't drink anymore?
Doesn't drink on duty?
Doesn't drink and drive, Detective?
-Major....
-You've got to help me on this, Michael.
The murder warrant's on hold.
The Deputy gave us another month.
Also, whoever that was
you brought in here today...
gave himself up
as an eyewitness to the Gant murder.
Who? Omar?
Greggs said to tell you
she'd write it up in the morning.
Lieutenant...
thanks.
It cost you?
Low man scrapped, yo.
He all the way down.
But we going to start fresh
on the latest tomorrow...
-down from up North.
-No problem.
-No problem?
-Yeah, yo's talkin' about some guy...
named Lohman, who's down with strep...
-Iike he's sick.
-And the last part?
And the last part is something about
how he's gonna start up...
a Fashion Lady or some shit.
-Fashion Lady?
-I'm fluent in the Perkins Homes...
and Latrobe Tower dialects,
but I haven't quite mastered...
the Franklin Terrace.
He's saying they're sold out
in the low-rises...
so tomorrow they're gonna
start fresh with a new package.
-That's what you hear?
-Listen again.
-Low man scrapped, yo.
-Low man, meaning the low-rise pit.
-He all the way down.
-Is down to scraps on the last package.
But we going start fresh
on the latest tomorrow...
down from up North.
Tomorrow, he'll start
fresh on the latest package.
Damn, how you all hear it so good?
"Gold Coast slave ship
bound for cotton fields...
"sold in a market down in New Orleans."
What the fuck is that?
Rolling Stones.
First two lines to Brown Sugar.
I bet you've heard that song 500 times,
but you never knew, right?
I used to put my head to the stereo speaker
and play that record over and over.
That explains a lot, actually.
-So, wait on black, yo?
-What's white on black?
Wait on black, right? Even I heard that shit.
Black's code for Stinkum.
We picked that up once we got on his pager.
Now, there's gonna be a re-up of
four G-packs in the low-rise court.
Stinkum is on the re-up
and it's gonna go down around noon.
Are you sure about all that?
Turn it upside down.
Four hash marks in a row,
one for each G-pack...
"LO" for low-rises.
-1 2 for the time.
-"S" for Stinkum.
-How long to figure that out?
-Four or five hours.
You sit here looking at beeper messages
for five hours at a time?
I don't know, it's kinda fun figuring shit out.
You're not helping me out here, Sanny.
-Major, l--
-I ask you for one fucking thing....
-I know, but I don't--
-All these months, I'm carrying you.
I'm sitting here, watching case
after case stack up, right?
These are all yours,
and they're all open, Sanny.
Last year, your clearance rate was 40%.
This year, it's less than that.
I caught some tough ones.
There's not a lot of dunkers in there.
Mike, you're good on the dunkers.
I'll give you that.
Shit, comes to dunkers,
you solve probably 6, 7 out of 10.
-But a stone fucking whodunit?
-That's not a fair assessment, Major.
Fair? What the fuck is fair?
I got a detective out there, unsupervised,
running his own special ops unit...
burning me every chance he gets.
It's not my job to fuck another cop.
Not your job?
Tell you what, Detective.
I'm gonna be so fucking fair...
I'm gonna give you the choice.
Either bring me something on McNulty,
or go out there and do your job.
-Pick a file, any file.
-Major--
Pick a murder and solve it...
or bring me McNulty,
there's no third choice.
Stinkum will have a runner with him.
The runner's gonna be holding the package.
-When you get them, ride the bumper.
-So he knows we're there?
Right. Lay on the blue light if you need it.
Now, the runner's gonna bolt.
-I got the runner, you stay with Stinkum.
-No.
-I got the runner, he takes Stink?
-No.
You both take the runner.
-And Stink gets away?
-Nobody gets away.
If we pull in Stink on a car stop now,
we got to give up PC...
which means we got to give up the wire.
We didn't set all this up
for two days' worth of coke, did we?
We snatch the runner,
stick a hook in him and go back fishing.
And between the wiretap
and the runner bolting from the truck...
we got a charge on Stinkum
any time we want it.
We're also edging back into old murders,
pulling up fresh witnesses.
And there are assets to be seized,
stuff that fronts for the drug money.
-Like what?
-A strip club...
a couple of Westside laundromats,
a triple-A rated towing company...
a funeral parlor.
-A funeral parlor?
-He bought out one in Gwynn Falls last year.
The money's going everywhere.
That's just what we know from
one of Avon's girls bragging to a friend.
God knows what else he's got
that we don't know of.
Understand Barksdale's name is on nothing.
He's always a step or two removed.
Understand Barksdale's name is on nothing.
He's always a step or two removed.
It's a career case, Your Honor.
Look here, Jimmy.
You misspelled "culpable"...
and you're confusing "then" and "than."
T-H-E-N is an adverb used
to divide and measure time.
"Detective McNulty makes a mess...
"and then he has to clean it up."
It's great that you're going through
every word--
Not to be confused with T-H-A-N,
which is most commonly used...
after a comparative adjective or adverb,
as in:
"Rhonda is smarter than Jimmy."
Yeah? Look, there is more than enough
indication of progress...
to justify continued intercepts.
I'll sign an order
for 30 more days on all taps and clones.
One copy to the court,
one to the State's Attorney?
-Anything else you need?
-What, from you?
I think I'll go see a man about a dog.
It's always a pleasure, Ms. Pearlman.
Your professional demeanor
and your overall competence...
stands in stark contrast against
the usual municipal backdrop...
of mediocrity and indifference.
-Sarcasm, Judge?
-No.
Another 10 years of this nonsense,
and I see you wearing the robes...
of the District Court for Baltimore City.
That or a straitjacket.
Jesus.
I would love to throw a fuck into her.
The red hair, freckles....
Don't you think, Jimmy?
As in all matters before the Court,
I think whatever the Judge thinks.
Come on, Jimmy.
Sit. Talk.
-1 2-14.
-What's up?
Eastbound on Preston.
Stinkum and a young boy riding shotgun.
They're at the light right now.
Got them.
Let's see how he plays it.
Fucking shit.
He's gonna bail any moment.
-Jump out!
-Bail-out on Druid Hill, 700 Block...
suspect wearing gray sweats,
running into the court.
Fuck me.
Close shop. Police.
-C'mon, shorty. Step.
-He ain't man enough for you.
Re-up!
Hello, Officer.
Run, man!
-Move, motherfucker.
-White man walking!
Yo, move, shorty, that's my re-up, yo!
-Goddamn.
-He's coming back!
-Give it up, son!
-Cut him off, cut him off!
Yo, get him!
-I got the bag!
-He's going right.
-Get the bag.
-Yo, move, man!
What's up?
Damn, motherfucker.
Bet you don't do that shit to a white man.
Y'all get the fuck away from him.
That man ain't did nothing to nobody.
Four packs. Street-ready.
-1 2-08.
-12-08.
Need a wagon inside the 800 block of Lex...
-inside the court.
-10-4, 12-08.
Anyone got a smoke?
How are you sitting with your bosses?
Rawls tried to close
this thing down last week.
Blow the wiretap by charging
some weak-sister murders.
-What stopped him?
-Daniels.
-Daniels?
-I couldn't believe it either.
I'm ready to throw in the fucking towel,
Daniels stepped up.
Yeah? Why didn't you come to me?
You don't trust me no more, Jimmy?
Who dropped a dime to that
newspaper reporter, Your Honor?
Where you been?
35 cents these days,
before anybody'll cough up a dial tone.
No, it's 50.
I got another week
before my homicide shift flips to night work.
I'm not back with them,
Rawls sticks it to me.
You got a friend here.
Worse comes to worse,
Pearlman goes to her bosses.
The State's Attorney's office
still has some love for you, Jimmy.
I'm starting to worry more
about the people who claim to love me...
than the ones who don't.
Now?
Yeah.
Somebody's hitting Stringer Bell's pager
from the Number 2 payphone...
in the Tower Court.
-Now?
-Now.
What's up?
-Freamon.
-Visual on Stinkum.
-Yo, we lost four to 5-0.
-What?
-We lost four.
-Yo, why the fuck are you telling me this?
I'll talk to you later.
Does he think I can
just pull it out of my ass?
Can't go outside and play till
your homework's done?
Can't do shit till I clear this case for Rawls.
How old is it?
Old and cold.
Yours to begin with?
Then, my friend, you are double-fucked.
Motherfucker.
Son of a bitch!
Give me the card.
-You sick, heartless bastard.
-Come on, give me the card.
She was a gypsy woman
She was a gypsy woman
-Madame Laurie?
-You scoff?
Madame fucking LaRue, Jay?
Better men than you have
turned to this lady...
in their dark night of dead ends.
You're not serious.
I don't joke
when it comes to Madame LaRue.
The woman, she has an unexplainable gift...
in matters of death investigation.
She transcends the rational.
Give her a call.
He's dropped here,
so the dumpsters cover it from this side.
But everyone over there
with a window had a view.
Merit badge for two good little Scouts.
Ma'am, you need some help with that?
-I'm all right.
-Please, it's our pleasure.
Let me understand.
Y'all hang around the projects,
white and black together...
ties and jackets on, looking to help ladies
with their shopping carts...
and whatever else.
Police, right?
Afraid so, Ma'am.
About the murder a while back, right?
Maintenance man?
The defendants can take a seat.
-The judge will be in shortly.
-Can I take the file?
-Here.
-Thank you.
Excuse me, Ma'am?
-Detective?
-I need to pull one out.
Yeah, which one?
Let's see. Dope, coke, dope, theft, dope...
Ioitering, coke, attempted theft, dope...
dope, theft, dope,
and the charge du jour is...
possession, to wit, cocaine.
-But you need him?
-I need him.
Okay, he bounces over to drug court...
pleads to possession
and agrees to probation...
with ongoing treatment.
-That's it?
-That's it.
Okay.
I'm with your boy Bubs.
-You want out, right?
-Yeah.
Plead guilty to possession
and convince the drug court judge...
you want to get your shit clean.
-Drug court?
-Shake it off in treatment...
go to some meetings
and pee when they tell you to pee.
-No jail?
-No jail.
-I'm out right now?
-Soon as you're processed.
Okay.
Dead man was coming this way
and another man was walking behind him.
Must've said something to him, because he
turned around before he got shot.
-Do you know the man who did it?
-No, sir.
-What'd he look like?
-Who?
-The bad guy.
-Light skin, medium height.
Didn't have no meat on him.
-Young or old?
-He wasn't young.
Okay, if you pretend
my partner here is the victim...
and I'm the guy with the gun....
-This close?
-No.
Like that?
Yeah, that's about right.
-Do you think, if you saw this guy again--
-I didn't....
Ma'am, please, don't be afraid.
From where I was sitting,
his back was to me.
It's all right, you done good.
You have any trouble at all, you call us.
-She can't make a positive ID.
-My man Omar can.
A stickup artist with a half-dozen priors.
That's your eyeball witness?
She corroborates him on the details,
right down to the close-range shot.
We've also got Omar saying
if we jack Bird, we'll get the gun.
Says he's too stupid to throw it off.
So, between her and Omar,
a match on the gun gets us over.
It happened like you said...
Iike it was a plan.
It was a plan.
What's your address?
734 Fayette.
734 Fayette.
What's the apartment?
Kid, what apartment?
Come on, kid, what's the apartment?
-1 1-M.
-Okay, 1 1-M. Is that so hard?
What's your DOB?
Come on, kid.
What?
It's him.
Who?
Kevin Johnson?
You hungry? Ham and cheese? Tuna?
I want a Reese's, yo. Peanut butter cup.
Drink?
Tea in a can.
You got it.
Go down to the machines.
Get a peanut butter cup
and a can of Lipton's tea.
Motherfucker can't even look at me.
-What say we start over on this?
-Start over?
My lawyer said I got a case
against y'all for this shit.
Fuck the lawyers.
I'm trying to talk about life here, Kevin.
Game already cost you, right?
More than it should have, I know.
Whose fault is that?
His. Ours.
Mine, maybe.
Thing is, I feel like
I owe you something here.
So, I'm asking how you want to carry this.
You want to get out?
You want to do something else
with the rest of your years?
You come see me.
Tea was sold out.
Might be tomorrow, might not be for a while.
But when you're ready for
something different, give me a call.
I'll remember.
Motherfucker thinking he can
pimp me over a candy bar.
I'm thinking it might be a drug thing,
or maybe straight-up robbery.
-You're lrish, no?
-Italian.
-Santangelo?
-Santangelo.
Saint Angelo.
Early martyr, patron saint of Licata, ltaly.
Prayed for his killer
with the knife still in him.
But it's not Saint Angelo calling.
It's Saint Anthony who wants to help you.
He does?
Very much.
Ain't he the guy you call
when you lose something?
You sure that's Anthony?
Go to the victim's grave, bury the statue...
wait an hour, a full hour, no shortcuts.
Then dig it up. Go straight home.
When you go to bed, hold it to your ear.
And he tells me who did it?
I think it was my turn to pick.
Yeah, definitely my turn. You had me
down at the B&O the other night.
After you dragged me
to the Sugar Hill Tavern, remember?
No.
Hey, Turk.
Where's Nadine this fine evening?
Gainesville. Been down in Florida
at her sister's all damn week.
Shame to say, though. Lack of pussy
will change even a good man's demeanor.
Sweet as can be.
Marla.
Good to see you.
You remember my husband, Cedric?
Yes, I do. Nice to see you.
Marla's with me on the GBC's
downtown redevelopment committee.
She's the one that prods me
awake at the meetings.
That was drastic stuff.
Everybody was nodding off.
-That last one was so long--
-Excuse me.
I think it's the best ticket in years.
$500-a-plate fundraisers
for a police lieutenant?
Even in this city, that constitutes cruel
and unusual punishment.
And which member of the ticket
has so energized you?
The Mayor? Council President?
-The Registrar of Wills, maybe?
-The Mayor, I might recognize if I saw him.
For the rest,
I'd pretty much need B of I photos.
You're not wrong, Lieutenant.
In this state,
it's a thin line between campaign posters...
and photo arrays.
Pop quiz.
City council? Eastside, maybe?
State senator.
Clay Davis, from the 39th District.
Vice-chair on the budget committee.
You'll never make Major at this rate.
Excuse me, while I do my duty
and kiss some senatorial haunches.
Clay, nice to see you again.
Come on, let's roll.
Ain't you gonna sign it?
No, you get that back
when the meeting's over.
And if you don't stay, we don't sign.
That's how it works.
Come on, I want to see the show.
Bubbs.
10: We continue to take personal inventory...
and when we are wrong, promptly admit it.
1 1 : We sought through
prayer and meditation...
to improve our conscious contact with God,
as we understood Him....
I ain't seen some of these faces in so long,
thought they were dead.
Same thing, ain't it?
Having had a spiritual awakening
as the result of these steps...
we try to carry
this message to other addicts...
and practice these principles
in all our affairs.
Today's speaker is going to be Waylon...
who, if you come to these meetings,
you have to know.
Hell, you all know I'm Waylon,
and I'm an addict.
Hi, Waylon.
And the fact is that I want to be clean today
more than I want to be high.
I know that's right.
It's good to be here.
Hell, it's good to be anywhere clean.
Even Baltimore.
I been clean a few 24 hours now,
and I'm still dead certain...
that my disease wants me dead.
Yeah, I'm in here with you all, talking shit
about how strong I am, how strong I feel...
but my disease is out there in that
parking lot, doing push-ups on steroids...
waiting for the chance to kick my ass
up and down the street again.
Scars on my hands, on my feet...
two bouts of endocarditis...
Hep C and whatnot knocking down walls
and kicking out windows in my liver.
I lost a good wife...
bad girlfriend, and the respect of anyone...
that ever tried to loan me money
or do me a favor.
Pawned my pickup, my bike...
my National Steel guitar...
and a stamp collection
that my granddad left me.
And when it was almost over for me...
and I was out there on them corners...
not a pot to piss in,
and anyone that ever knew me or loved me...
cussing my name,
you know what I told myself?
I said, "Waylon, you're doing good."
I surely did.
I thought I was God's own drug addict.
And if God hadn't meant
for me to get high...
he wouldn't have made
being high so much, like, perfect.
Now, I know I got one more high left in me...
but I doubt very seriously
if I have one more recovery.
So if there's anybody out there
that sees that bottom coming up at them...
I'm here to talk sense.
I don't care who you are...
what you done...
or who you done it to.
If you're here...
so am l.
That's right.
The Mustard Seed Group
gives out key chains...
for stretches of clean time.
So if you've earned it,
come on up and get it.
Does anybody have nine months?
Does anybody have six months?
-Does anybody have three months?
-Yeah.
Does anybody have one month?
And now, for the most
important person in this room...
does anybody have 24 hours...
or a sincere desire to live?
Yeah, all right.
We shoved off this morning.
"God grant me the strength...
"to accept the things I cannot change...
"and the courage
to change the things I can...
"and the wisdom to know the difference."
What's the score?
Orioles, 4 to 3.
Bernie Williams just doubled, though.
They always let the Yankees
back into it, always.
No, they got a bullpen this year.
-Who's pitching?
-Buddy Groom.
Who you driving for?
Marla Daniels.
I'd love to crack this here crib.
Yeah?
Good day's work. Good day's work.
What about the alarm system?
Shit, I'd wire that weak-ass
thing back on itself...
pull the truck up,
bust through those French doors.
-That'd work.
-Yes, indeed.
Sell most of this good shit around the way...
but some of it, like the art and all,
I might have to run it up New York.
Name's Damien Price.
But I mostly go by Day-Day.
I'm Cedric Daniels.
But I mostly go by Lieutenant.
Look, they're bringing in Roberts.
There you are.
There's somebody I need you to meet.
-Go on.
-Yeah.
-Take it all off.
-Rub them together like that.
See here, motherfucker.
You got to put this Gant thing on Bird...
and you got to do something
with that other case...
the young girl.
Diedre Kresson.
You need to be able to
charge both them murders...
and then you walk that on up to Rawls.
Now, you see, Jimmy...
here's the hard part,
for an asshole like yourself:
You just got to give him
them clearances like a goddamn gift.
And then you still might have
to kiss his ass...
for about three, four motherfucking months.
You're gonna have to do it.
Three or four months?
Got to, Jimmy.
Too fucking late to do anything else.
You gonna be one ass-kissing white man.
You know why I respect you
so much, Bunk?
It's not 'cause you're good police.
'Cause, you know, fuck that, right?
Fuck that, yeah.
It's not 'cause when I came to Homicide,
you taught me all kinds cool shit about....
I don't know, whatever.
Whatever.
It's 'cause when it came time
for you to fuck me...
you were very gentle.
Damn right.
See, 'cause you could've
hauled me out of the garage...
and just bent me
over the hood of a radio car.
But no, you were very gentle.
I knew it was your first time.
I wanted to make that shit special.
It was, man.
It fucking was.
-Take your fucking money back.
-No, this is mine.
Take it back, you old whore.
Turk.
Can I get one more?
What's up?
-They up there, right?
-Yeah, they up there.
Hey, Dee.
You get a chance, man,
let me pull your coat to something.
I got a little move we might could do.
So get with me after, okay?
All right. Most def.
The only reason why I even called Bell
was because these niggers--
You're not supposed to talk shit
on the phone and you know that.
What's up, bro?
Who's snitching?
-Nobody.
-Is you sure on that, man?
You done had the stick-up,
then the jump-out.
-Now, they running up on Stink.
-My crew, we tight.
All right?
Ain't nobody holding no extra money.
I checked all that.
Maybe your ass just ran a stop
or had a taillight out or some shit like--
You think I'd run a stop with $40,000?
-Fuck no.
-Nigger, I don't know.
Something is up.
So go down there today...
tell them hoppers you got
working for you down there...
that this shit is about to change.
Stringer gonna come down there,
he gonna run through the changes.
Until this shit is straight, the Pit is dead.
Thing is, why they didn't pop Stink?
Knockos took the boy and the package,
and they got Stink by the tags on the truck.
You took that down to the police
and filed a report, right?
Truck, I ditched that shit
up off Cold Spring Lane, man.
You ain't heard nothing
from the knockos yet, right?
-No.
-What the fuck?
They catch four packs
popping out the truck.
They don't even get the plate?
What's all this shit?
Something's up, man.
Something is definitely up.
I got somewhere I gotta be.
Cover me with Daniels, will you?
Asshole.
Herc, Carver.
-What?
-What?
Come here.
Come here.
Them two is freaks.
Stash-finding motherfuckers
popped the package from nowhere.
Who you talking?
Skinny black motherfucker
and that ass-ugly knocko.
The white boy with the ball cap.
-The ones who jumped Bodie?
-Batman and Robin.
All right?
-Bang.
-You got them, baby.
-I'm Batman.
-I don't think so.
-Batman's white.
-And Robin's black?
You heard the hopper,
you're the ass-ugly white guy.
Boy Wonder,
why don't you suck my bat-dick?
Get the fuck outta here.
Why don't you sign this for me there,
Mr. One-day Man?
God have mercy when they piss you, boy.
You mean the god of my understanding?
No, we gotta get you
some clean piss, you know...
so you can take up
into your probation office.
Yo, Bubs.
Who the fuck do we know with clean piss?
-So you're ready to charge this one?
-If we luck into the gun, yeah.
And then we tag-team Bird.
If we get him with the gun,
we take it federal.
Five years minimum,
and he's got prior felonies...
it's a lot more.
We got an address we want to hit?
We're working with informants.
As soon as we get something, we jump.
...warm air for the afternoon...
partly sunny, windy and warm
with a chance of thunderstorms...
high up to 83, and then on Friday,
clearing and windy with a high near 70.
Weather updated around
the clock on WTOP radio.
I'm meteorologist Dave Lew
at the Weather Channel.
This is the WTOP radio network.
You worried about being seen?
If anybody got a problem
with me spending time with y'all...
I'd be much obliged to stick
my gun straight in their mouth.
How's that work?
Bird not up in the mix today.
If we had more than a street name,
maybe we could come up with an address.
What can I say? Out here, Bird just Bird.
So, what up,
you all fixing snatch him from out here?
That's the plan.
He don't pack down here, none of them do.
And that's the rule.
Now, if you want iron, you gotta go
to one of those kids up in the towers.
-We need the gun.
-Then y'all got a problem.
Without knowing his crib,
we definitely got a problem.
Not unless y'all know where Bird like to cop.
-What, Bird gets high?
-Not in the towers, he don't.
Avon ain't having his people using.
That's another rule.
"Never get high on your own supply."
Now, if I was hunting Mr. Bird...
I would consider the best package
to be the red Dilly...
that's over there in Carrollton.
That's if I have to be
constabulating like you all.
Carrollton?
I know one thing, when you all
run up on him, you all best be more...
careful, that is.
Why is that?
Bird will throw down
without thinking, for sure.
Poot.
Where Wallace been at, man?
I don't know.
He in the wind.
Wallace been fucked up.
Since they got that stickup boy, you know?
Put him on the car like that.
Wallace all quiet and shit.
Don't even come out his room some days.
I'm looking for Dee. You seen him?
Dee.
Chilling?
What's up?
-What're you doing down in the projects?
-I got something, man.
Something right.
Come on over.
Where the shop at?
Nothing today.
See, that's the thing,
'cause if you need more of that...
I got this connect.
Yeah?
This guy I know from the club, he from D.C.
He got this thing through New Orleans,
these Jamaicans down there.
New Orleans?
They're offering weight, Dee.
-My uncle know about it?
-No, see.
This thing on the side for me...
I got enough to turn
a New York quarter on it...
but I don't have what you got right here
with the distribution.
You see what I'm saying?
I'm saying, Dee,
I'd be taking all the risk with them peoples.
Once I have the package, I bring it
down here to you, and you put it out.
We do an even split on what comes back.
Right?
Let me think on that, all right?
Finally get some ends for us.
You see what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Yeah, most def.
I'm out.
-Be good.
-Think on that.
$5 hats, right here. $5, baby, $5.
$5 hats, right here. $5, baby, $5.
$5, yeah. Everybody, $5 hats right here.
Which door are we watching again?
The vacant next to the store.
That's the shooting gallery.
Is he still in there?
Greggs is on the back
and we're on the front, so you tell me.
Yeah.
$5 hats, right here. $5, baby, $5.
I got you right here.
Cover up that head of yours.
You know what I mean?
Can't beat that, right?
$5 hats, right here. $5 hats.
-$5 hat there, mister.
-Fuck you, man.
Take them.
Shorty.
Get your hands back.
I got him.
Get off me, man.
Get the fuck off me.
-I got the feet.
-Bitch-ass cops!
There we go.
Yeah, look what we have here.
Baby.
Get the fuck off me.
My hand.
-Fucking bitch.
-Shut the fuck up!
Shit is tight, man.
We should leave the couch
right there, right?
-Yeah, leave that shit right there.
-That's nice, that's straight.
So?
What's the deal, String?
-How often you all changing the stash?
-Every night since we got jacked.
-Anybody on the team getting high?
-No, man. Just the old touts.
And they ain't handling no money, no vials.
You all been going in and out
of the vacants?
Making sure them narcos
don't set up in there?
Yeah, for sure.
I got no cell phones,
no house phones neither, right?
No, man, nothing but these pagers
and them pay boxes over there, that's it.
All right, tear them motherfuckers out.
What?
Tear out them phones.
From now on, you all need a payphone,
you walk a few blocks...
and you do not use
the same phone more than once a day.
You hear me?
-You hear me, right?
-Done.
-All right. Bey, tear them motherfuckers out.
-Come on, man.
Man, come on. Get off the phone.
So, we wanted to hang...
the velvet backdrop...
with the Lexus and the pit bulls...
but it's still out at the dry cleaners.
But seriously, folks,
we really wanted to show all the jurors...
that you left our little interrogation here
without any more scuff marks...
than what you brought in.
Fuck you, fat man.
"Fuck you, fat man."
I thought we were friends.
That gun is downstairs now,
in the ballistics lab.
It comes back on a dead state's witness,
then you're gonna see death row.
-You up for that?
-Suck my dick, dyke cunt.
Where's my lawyer at?
Freak. Cunt-eater.
You got one chance,
you stupid motherfucker.
You roll back on the people
you killed William Gant for...
or you gonna eat the whole meal.
Tell you what...
gimme this hand back and step to me,
and I'll fuck you in all three holes.
Fucking charmer, this one.
Bitch.
You ain't got shit on me.
-One of you should go in.
-Is she in trouble?
Kima? He keeps this up, she'll cut his ass.
You ain't shit!
You ain't got shit on me!
So, you're my eyeball witness?
So, why'd you step up on this?
Bird trifling, basically.
He killed an everyday working man and all.
Don't get it twisted, I do some dirt, too...
but I ain't never put my gun
on nobody who wasn't in the game.
A man must have a code.
No doubt.
-Man, I know you from somewhere.
-Yeah?
I was in Southwestern
before I came to Homicide.
Worked Frederick Road.
No, I mean, back in the day.
You go to Edmondson, right?
Yeah, you was ahead of me.
I remember you was the first brother
I ever seen play that sport with a stick.
What's it called?
-Lacrosse, man.
-For sure.
Yeah, I was All-Metro attack.
Prep school boys used to pee themselves
when they see old Bunk coming at them.
So look here, homey.
Seeing as how you're being all charitable
with your recollections...
what else you got in the way
of open murders?
-Going to Barksdale?
-Going anywhere.
-How far back do you want me to go?
-As far as you need.
Murder stay murder.
Thanks.
Gun matches.
You're done, Bird.
Last chance to grab a little something
for yourself on a deal.
Eat my shit first,
you downtown white whore.
Yeah, that's right.
Take this ugly-ass cunt-eater with you, too.
Yo, I'm cuffed, man.
You gonna at least give me
a fair chance, right?
Come on, man. Don't do me like that, man.
You fat fuck!
Take these handcuffs off, man!
Fulton and Baker, you say?
It happened last year,
couple days after Easter.
This girl by the name of Neecee.
She about 30, 35.
Denise Redding.
Yeah, I got it.
I'll be damned.
Bird sure know how to bring it
out in people, don't he?
Hello?
The Lindsey case, right?
No, Lindsey. Martin Lindsey.
Who the fuck is Denise Redding?
-What the fuck did you do to him?
-Here's yours, Mike.
I don't even fucking remember this one.
I swear I don't.
Well, it's down.
Our boy gave us a statement,
two witnesses and an ID of your shooter.
Take it with our compliments.
Sanny.
What are you doing downtown
this time of night?
Madame fucking LaRue?
I gotta thank you, Jaybird,
you saved my fucking life here.
Only thing I can't figure is I asked
for help on the Lindsey case, not this one.
Mike...
fuck the gypsy shit.
These are the guys that
saved your ass, right here.
Thanks.
Jimmy.
We gotta talk, man.
It's about Rawls.
What's the plan here?
Drunken fuck on a Tuesday night?
-Is it Wednesday morning?
-I'm not drunk.
It's Rawls.
He's going after my badge.
What?
They're gonna do me, Ronnie.
They're gonna do me.
I love this fucking job,
and they're gonna do me.
Come on.
Number 18.
Conine.
I knew that one.
All right, this one's for Mikey.
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, one lemonade, please.
You ready?
Number 6.
I know it.
-David Segui?
-Melvin Mora, numbnuts.
I thought Mora was number 9.
Guys, we're gonna play that spy game.
Remember the spy game?
-Yeah.
-Who's it?
That tall black guy over there.
You're supposed to say
African-American, Dad.
African-American, then.
-I'm the front, you're the follow.
-I was the follow last time.
Don't argue, go on. Go.
Come on!
I got him.
Yeah, they're both brown hair, one that big,
the other about that big...
and he's wearing, I don't know
what the fuck he's wearing. He's....
Will Michael and Sean McNulty
please report to the offices...
at the rear of the market.
Michael and Sean McNulty.
Please report.
One pay phone goes down, don't mean shit.
Both at the same time, that's a plan.
-We spooked them.
-Busting the runner?
Maybe it's that, maybe it's something else.
We still got the tower phones.
And we're up
on Stringer Bell's pager now, too.
Yeah, but this shows
just how cautious these guys are.
We make any play,
and they're ready to change up on us.
If they're not using
the pay phones in the low-rises...
then what are they doing?
They're walking to another pay phone.
We might see more traffic
on the tower pay phones.
Sergeants' test's tomorrow, right?
4:00 in the afternoon.
You ain't gonna take it this time?
Sure, why not?
-You ain't gonna study?
-Sure I am.
You guys need to follow
some of the boys out of the Pit...
and see what they're using for pay phones.
Excuse me, is that a direct order?
I'm just saying--
If you wanna follow these assholes
from phone to phone...
why don't you do it yourself?
I'm in-office, remember?
-Right, they took your gun.
-For shooting your car.
No, that was before.
-That's right, that was something else.
-Right.
You believe this guy?
Like there are fucking stripes on his sleeve.
You guys need to get up
on those rooftops today.
See what these mopes are using for phones.
Come here, look at this shit.
What the fuck is that?
-Let me look at that shit.
-Bird told me that shit.
Fucking peter-puffer,
get the fuck out of here.
Mr. Omar, you want ends on this?
No, darling, I'm cool.
Nice shirt.
Yeah, fuck you.
It takes guts wearing a pink shirt
on the BPD Homicide unit.
Yes, it does.
Guts, or a familiarity
with alternative lifestyles.
-What are you chasing?
-Toyota Camry.
Whose?
It's listed to some woman
with a county address...
but Saturday, my man
Stringer Bell was using it.
You were working the weekend?
No, I'm down in the Northeast market
with the kids, right?
-Who should appear before me?
-Market day for String, too?
I know he makes me if I get too close,
so I tell Sean and Michael front-and-follow.
They're so good, I lose track of them,
scared the shit out of myself.
But they stay with him, spec the Camry...
and Sean, my flesh and blood, gets the tag.
Your kids know front-and-follow?
They fucking love it.
We play spy in the mall sometimes.
Anyhow, I got a Woodmore address
of a woman...
who lends her wheels to Stringer Bell.
-It's a start.
-The fucking family McNulty. Jesus.
What?
Wallace.
-What?
-Yo, Wallace.
-What?
-What's this about here?
This one here?
"A bus traveling on Central Avenue begins
its route by picking up eight passengers.
"Next, it picks up four more, and then an
additional two, while discharging one.
"At the next-to-last stop,
three passengers get off the bus...
"and another two get on. How many
passengers are on the bus at the last stop?"
Just do it in your head.
Yo, testers coming out today.
New package.
I might be down later.
Later?
Look, I'll catch you
around the way, all right?
Wallace, man, you can't just lay up in here.
-Seven, right?
-Dee been asking about shit.
-So what?
-I been telling him you sick...
but you know he won't let me carry that
too much longer.
Now, look, I be down later sometime.
-No, man, testers gonna be out.
-Look, man, fuck the testers, all right?
Fuck the testers, fuck Dee, fuck all that shit.
Just let me hold $10,
and I'll give it back to you by Friday.
How? Dee ain't gonna pay you
for not working.
Look, you gonna let me hold $10, or not?
Eight?
Damn, Sarah, look. Close your eyes.
You working a ground stash. 20 tall pinks.
Two fiends come up and ask for two each,
another one cops three.
Then Bodie hands you 10 more,
but a white guy rolls up in a car...
waves you down, and pays for eight.
How many vials you got left?
Fifteen.
How the fuck can you keep the count right,
but not do the book problem?
Count be wrong, they'll fuck you up.
-No, he coming to you.
-Today?
-Yeah.
-He in a rush or something?
No, we told him to do it like that.
He had his hand out last night...
and we told him first thing today.
-He ain't coming into the tower?
-No, not like that.
Just run 20 on down to him.
He gonna roll on his way, all right?
-Be there in, like, an hour, maybe.
-Who gonna know?
-Little Man, he know Day.
-All right.
That was Stringer Bell?
Calling tower pay phone number 1,
after taking a page 15 minutes ago.
-We know Little Man?
-Yeah.
Enforcer in the 221 building.
Okay, so he's rolling out of the 221
in about a half an hour or so...
with 20 whatevers to hand off
to someone named Day.
Product coming out of the towers.
We're usually trying to catch it going in.
Yeah, if you wanna catch them,
we're gonna have to hustle.
Wallace, man, he bugging.
-Where he be at?
-Nowhere.
He just lays around all day, you know?
Begged my ass off for sandwich money.
You worried about him?
I mean, shit ain't right, Dee.
You might consult with him some.
What the fuck, man? lf he don't wanna
be down here, that's on him.
I mean, ain't like nobody holding
no gun to his head or nothing.
Yeah, but he ain't about nothing else.
He up in his room and shit,
all the damn day.
He up in his room and shit,
all the damn day.
All right, tell Wallace to come see me.
All right.
Be right back.
It's been two hours.
What if Little Man ain't working
in the 221 today?
What if this Day guy don't come?
What if he came,
and we missed the pick-up?
Yo, Herc, what if your mother
and father never met?
-How's shop doing?
-Steady rolling.
All right, let's take a ride.
-Beef run.
-Beef run, where at?
Pulaski, baby, the good shit.
Get in the car, man.
Yo, Poot. You the man for an hour.
Shit, look at me.
-Kima.
-The Lincoln, we're on it.
Hang back. Let's see where he goes.
I don't understand that, never did.
Damn, Bey, how can you stand that shit
with all that hot shit on it?
Man, trick is not to give a fuck, boy.
I got this, you know me.
So what? My uncle's cut y'all loose today?
No, we're celebrating.
Stinkum got some points
for some fresh territory.
I heard about that.
How much is yours in the package?
20.
We gotta run off the niggers
that been down there.
Ain't no thing.
Bunch of off-brand niggers is all.
You keep running that pit the way you been,
you gonna see points, too.
Yeah, you know, shit, I'm here waiting.
It'll come, right, Stink?
Yeah, I been talking to Orlando, right?
He said he got this good
coke connect from New Orleans.
Orlando?
He want me to put what he can get
out into the court, a little extra on the side.
I don't know, Dee,
you better talk to your uncle about that.
-Yeah, definitely.
-Hear that?
Yeah, I'm gonna see what he say on it. Yeah.
But, you know, today is your day, man.
-Stink day.
-His night, too.
Yeah, man, we gonna
break out tonight, daddy.
Bring some of Orlando's good pussy
over there by Little Man's.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
You up there? You up?
-Yeah, he up.
-You up.
Nigger, I'm up! You don't gotta ask twice.
-What's wrong?
-No.
He give a fuck now.
Water.
-Step out of the car, sir.
-What did I do?
Step out of the car.
Go around to my partner, here.
-Man, look, I'm already late.
-Put your hands on the roof, please, sir.
Sir, you were observed in one of the city's
designated drug-free, anti-loitering zones...
where a drug suspect
leaned into your vehicle...
handing you something.
And when we signaled for you to stop...
you leaned over
as if concealing something...
-beneath the passenger seat.
-Look, enough of this shit, now.
-Is there something beneath that seat, sir?
-No.
Then you don't mind if we look, right?
Fuck y'all. This is some bullshit.
-That's none of your business, all right?
-How about if I make it my business?
You rang?
-Who's he?
-Damien Lavell Price.
He takes $20,000 in cash
out of the 221 building.
Lester picked up the drop
from one of the tower phones.
We followed him up Reservoir Hill
till he spotted us.
-He's a legislative aide?
-Who paged me?
He's in your office.
We popped him with $20,000 in cash.
-What kind of PC?
-Right off the wire.
Stringer Bell to someone on a tower phone.
We thought we were gonna
come up with drugs.
Got money instead.
I know this guy.
Orioles won last night.
Bullpen stood up to Boston.
You get that money cracking cribs, or what?
I'd like to speak to my attorney.
He was driving for a politician
at this fundraiser I went to.
-Which one?
-Someone from Annapolis...
from the looks of his ID, anyway.
-What do we charge here?
-He say the money's his?
He doesn't say shit.
He doesn't say shit.
Keep the cash, write him a receipt.
He wants to put a claim in
to the city solicitor, he can.
But they're gonna ask him
where he got the pile.
The angel of death.
Who's that?
Major Reed, lID.
Lieutenant, a word.
What's up?
-How you doing?
-Me?
Yeah, you. Everything is good?
I'm all right.
I mean, you fixed for cash
or something, man?
'Cause if you need a little something...
really, the thing to do is just to ask for it.
That's all I do,
is put money in your pocket...
and make sure
you don't stray from the nest!
Sit down.
Listen, the last motherfucking thing I need
is for the clean name on my liquor license...
to be dirtied the fuck up by you.
You understand that?
Avon, come on, man.
Do your fucking job!
I checked with
the state Personnel Department.
He's on the payroll
of Senator Davis' district office...
for more than a year.
He did four years in Hagerstown
for daytime B and E.
Before that, drug charges
and a PBJ on a check charge.
And now we catch him coming out
of the towers...
with $20,000 in manicured, banded money.
You brought him in here on what charge?
Civil forfeiture.
Until he tells us a legitimate source
for that money, we keep it.
So you have no criminal charge.
No, just the money.
Give it back.
-Sir?
-Give the man back his money.
Sir, we pulled this off the wire...
with one of our suspects telling
another to expect a pick-up.
-It's drug money in that car.
-Give him back his money.
Write it up as an unwarranted car stop.
Now I ask you to put a charge
on a drug dealer, Lieutenant.
That's all I ask.
And now I got wiretaps, pager clones,
affidavits coming out of my ass.
And you're in people's shit
where you're not supposed to be.
-Sir--
-I'm shutting this down, Lieutenant.
You charge what you can,
and you do it by the end of the week.
-We did nothing wrong here.
-You jacked up a senatorial aide.
You went into his pocket,
pulled out $20,000.
And though there's no criminal charge,
you think it wise to try to keep it.
You shit all over yourself...
all over me, all over this department.
Now, I told you, no surprises, remember?
$20,000, even.
Sign here, or you can
count it yourself, if you want.
So I can leave now?
Will somebody please tell me
what the fuck that was about?
This is bullshit.
We just gave back 20 large
of Barksdale's money.
Hey, what the fuck?
Let me guess, the Deputy?
How's he got onto this so quick?
-I told him.
-You told him?
Why would you be telling him?
He's the Deputy for Operations,
I arrested an aide to a state senator.
How do I not tell him?
Have you noticed there hasn't been
a complaint from the senator?
Know why?
What is his driver doing coming out
of the high-rises with so much money?
-I told the Deputy that.
-What did he say?
Mind our own business?
Give the man back his money
and go the fuck away?
Pretty much.
Except he said a few things
for my benefit, too.
Like how I had shit all over him.
Like how he was
shutting us down this week.
-The fuck he is.
-We're done.
I go past Friday, and I'm buried.
He told me that.
He's gonna bury you? For what?
You're doing your fucking job.
You think the job is gonna save me?
You think it's gonna save you?
Chain-of-command.
That's all I got from the Deputy, today.
Chain-of-command?
Did you tell your major about the
senator's driver? Or the Colonel?
No? Then where's your chain-of-command?
What's the shift lieutenant doing
going up the back stairs to the Deputy Ops?
-What are you saying?
-Nothing.
Goddamn right.
Why, he got something on you?
You say you got the Deputy's ear.
What the fuck's he got on you?
Only rank, Detective.
Yo, Stink. What about the rules, yo?
Special occasion, yo.
Yo, Bey.
-I'm gonna throw up.
-No, you ain't.
Burrell thinks I crossed him.
He said this to you?
In so many words.
-You need to explain then--
-Explain what?
That I'm bringing in a case
that goes everywhere?
Today, it was some senator's driver.
Two days from now,
a city councilman, maybe.
He asked for a charge on Barksdale.
That's all he asked for.
This thing with the legislative aide,
who could've foreseen it?
He saw it. Burrell.
See, this is the thing
that everyone knows and no one says.
You follow the drugs, you get a drug case.
You start following the money,
you don't know where you're going.
That's why they don't want wiretaps or
wired Cls or anything they can't control.
Because once that tape starts rolling,
who the hell knows what's going to be said?
That son of a bitch McNulty asked me
what the Deputy had on me.
He actually asked me that.
What did you say?
Where everybody go? Where the girls go?
Fuck it, man, party broke.
We drunked out and fucked out.
You all send me out for liquor,
and by the time I get back, the shit is dead?
Look at this.
The Knicks done fucked up their draft again.
What's with her?
Oh, fucked her silly. What can I say?
She snorted half the shit we brought up
in here, too, that greedy bitch.
Yo, Bey.
-You wanted to see us?
-What the hell is this?
I got copied this morning.
It's just what it looks like.
A memo signed by the Deputy Ops, Rawls
and Forester, telling us to pack it in.
We come down on the wire by Friday,
ship the computers to the DEA by Monday...
and charge whoever we have
by the end of next week.
Yeah? Who do you have?
Couple of mid-level guys.
Anton Artis, a.k.a. Stinkum.
Shooter named Bird,
wanted for killing Gant.
He was the witness in your court.
-That's it?
-Except for a couple of hangers-on, yeah.
Why are they doing this? Why now?
We picked up a bag man
coming out of the high-rises...
carrying $20,000 in cash, yesterday.
-So?
-So, he works for Clay Davis.
Of the 39th Legislative District.
The deputy was displeased.
It's okay, though.
We gave the money back,
said we were sorry.
-What can Daniels do?
-Not a fucking thing.
The Deputy sent him the same direct order
you have on your desk right there.
Get me Burrell on the line!
Detectives, when you swore
that your affidavit was true...
to the best of your ability,
what did the Circuit Court of Baltimore do?
-You gave us the wire.
-For how long, Detective McNulty?
Sixty days, no?
And how long have you monitored
these phone extensions?
Forty days, maybe.
Deputy Burrell is on the line.
Erv, it's Phelan.
Kiddo, you're fucking with me here.
Yes, you are.
Erv, listen to me.
The Circuit Court signed two orders...
for a total of 60 days
of telephonic surveillance.
Now, I'm looking at a copy
of a memo from your office...
telling me I can't have my 60 days.
You're not hearing me.
The Circuit Court for Baltimore
ordered 60 days on this tap.
The Court wants its 60 days.
Now, if you take this wire down on Friday,
you'll be in contempt of court on Monday.
Understood?
And all the best to Arlene and the kids.
Yeah.
Who's your daddy now?
Look, I didn't do a damn thing, Lieutenant.
You got a beef, it's with the judge.
Yeah, he got the Deputy's memo,
he called his own shot.
Ask Greggs if you don't believe me.
Look, I've got to go.
Kima.
Deputy called, mad as the devil.
Tell them to quit packing.
We're back up on the wire.
Kima.
McNulty or the judge? Or both?
This time, the judge.
Ask me a question. Any question.
I thought you weren't studying.
This job is common sense.
Ask me a question, dickless.
See how I do.
"According to Q1--"
Hold up, help me out, here.
You have to know them by the numbers?
It helps.
Makes it sound more professional that way.
"According to Q1 ...
"the general order
covering sexual harassment...
"in the event a female officer
in your squad complains...
"that her side partner
has sexually harassed her...
"you should:
"A: Notify the commanding officer.
"B: Notify the shift lieutenant.
"C: Notify the ranking female officer."
I go with D.
D?
Yeah, bitch-slap the side partner
for dipping into my private stock...
then take missy home
and fuck her till she smiles.
What the hell?
When a small change in price
creates a large change in demand...
then demand is said to be elastic,
but some products are inelastic.
Meaning, a change in price
does not affect demand.
Some key factors that affect
the elasticity of demand are what?
-Mr. Bell?
-Desire.
Consumer need.
Right, specifically, the ability of a consumer
to delay acquisition. What else?
My pencil lost its point.
All the girls say so.
Damon, we got work orders here,
and ain't nothing happening.
These jobs were due yesterday,
and people going to be coming in here...
asking for their work
and nothing been done.
Man, fuck them. Let them wait.
No, you are not going to bring that
corner bullshit up in here, you hear me?
You know what we got here?
We got an elastic product.
You know what that mean?
That mean when people can go elsewhere
and get their printing and copying done...
they gonna do it.
You acting like we got
an inelastic product and we don't.
Now, I want this to run
like a true fucking business.
Not no front, not no bullshit.
Understand me?
I'm serious.
-Where you snatch this old wreck from?
-Out Frederick Road.
Ditch it over Eastside when we done.
Check it.
Him there, and that other fool there.
They the only ones might be trouble.
I'll drop Scar,
you just drop that other motherfucker.
No, just Scar.
His boy break, we going to let him.
-But if he raise up, I'm on him, see?
-Damn, I wish Bird was here, man.
Bird be loving this shit right here.
Which do remind me,
we get up out of here...
you need to drop that shit
down a storm drain.
Now give me some time
to go around the block...
and set up on the other side, all right?
What up, who got black tops?
Hey, now.
What the fuck?
Listen here, Bey.
You come at the king, you best not miss.
-Stink's been got.
-Stink?
-Bey caught one, too, in the leg.
-Shit, man, what happened?
-They down the gulley on Edmondson.
-Fucking Scar, man.
-No, it ain't him. Omar, man.
-Omar?
Bounty's going up on that bitch.
That fucks us.
We had Stinkum tied up with a bow
from the arrest of the runner...
and now he's out of the case.
The man's a fucking loose cannon.
-Literally.
-We've got to pull his ass up at least.
There's a dime on this cocksucker's head.
One of you motherfuckers needs to step up.
-Where you go with that?
-Maryland General.
Walked up in there and told them
I was on the corner, caught a stray.
-Police come talk to you?
-Just a roller, no homicide.
-Put it out there.
-Not just our people, either.
I'm talking about any nigger
who wants to step up.
Put out the word.
There's $10,000 on Omar
or any motherfucker standing with Omar.
Y'all niggers ain't got shit to do
but be on this motherfuckin' hunt.
-Now be on it.
-All right.
So, what you think, homes?
I'm thinking this is the worst
part of the game.
-Best we do is break out even, right?
-What?
I'm saying, this shit got personal.
Ain't nothing else to it.
-So, you talking about letting it slide.
-For a time, maybe.
I'm saying we put the word out
that you ready to talk a truce.
When this nigger come out
from underneath his rock, you hit him.
But right now? This shit got out of hand.
What you want me to say?
Look, I don't know nothing
about Stink getting dropped...
and I don't know nothing
about Bey getting shot, either.
-I don't know about this crazy nonsense.
-I don't know, it came back to us quick.
You know how that be.
Everybody want to believe
the worst about Omar.
But live and let live, you know?
I don't see you letting
them slide on Brandon.
If I was coming after certain people...
I definitely wouldn't want to give
y'all fine people any cause for concern.
There are rules here, right?
-Rules?
-Yeah.
No mistakes, no bystanders.
No taxpayers getting caught up in the mix.
I mean, you just get in close
and you hit the right nigger.
And lose the gun afterward,
that'd be a rule, too, I think.
One thing, Omar.
Having Stinkum dropped
kind of fucks us on our thing.
How so?
We had Stink caught
with 4 G-packs on a re-up.
And maybe we could've built
something on that.
-Roll him up with Stringer, maybe.
-Now he's got no roll to him.
So, the point is, Omar,
while we're all grateful...
for the case you gave us on Bird,
and we admire your do-it-yourself nature--
We need you to hang back.
Look, man, it ain't all up to me, right?
I got a bounty on my head.
Yeah, we saw the van.
Look, man, I do what I can do
to help you all, but the game is out there.
And it's either play or get played.
What, that it?
Gentlemen. Ma'am.
Lester, are we still cops?
-Technically, I suppose so.
-Okay, I was just checking.
Keisha ain't called, and she ain't been home.
How was she when you left her?
She was sick, I told you that.
She missed work last night and she ain't
been down there to pick up her check today.
You know something?
This game...
this thing with my uncle...
might not be right for me, I'm thinking.
Why do you say that?
Nothing good to it but the money.
Sounds a lot like my job.
I mean, you got people using each other.
Scamming each other.
Cutting each other up
because they're late on a bill.
Shooting folks because
there might be a fucking dollar in it.
It gets to sometime
like I can't even fucking breathe.
Like I can't even get no air.
You know what I mean?
Do something else.
-So, you happy with your job?
-Shit.
Well then, do something else.
I am. I'm going to have to. Shit.
Can't stay pretty forever.
It's not forever, right, Dee?
And then what?
You pretty now.
Now we pretty.
You got me, holler back.
Dee, man.
Raise up and roll in quick.
Stink been got, man.
You hear me? They got Stink.
I need your help.
Who caught the one
from Edmondson last night? Anton Artis.
Cole, with an assist from Dunnigan.
-Omar was the shooter.
-Fuck me.
It's all over the wiretap.
Okay, let's see.
We put down one murder on the testimony
of one eyewitness...
who then goes out and drops
somebody else.
Yeah, it was payback
for his boyfriend, Brandon.
Anton Artis is Stinkum, one of the boys
who snatched Brandon and did him up.
I'm sure that motherfucker
had his reasons, Jimmy--
You want to give back the Gant case,
then tell Cole the name of his shooter.
You want to give back the Gant case,
then tell Cole the name of his shooter.
Otherwise, tell him we're hearing talk
on the wire...
and we'll give him his clearance
once we wrap our case.
But you won't.
No, we won't.
You want me to go and bullshit Cole
out of his case for you?
-Why don't you go tell him yourself?
-Are you kidding?
If Rawls sees my fingerprints on this,
he'll run my nuts through a cheese grater.
Fuck you, Jimmy.
-How's it going with it?
-Pretty good.
I like this kid who's fucking
my victim's old girlfriend.
Ray, can I talk to you for a minute?
In my office.
With cases like this one,
you are put in some strange fucking places.
Cole's doing good this year,
he don't need the clearance.
All right, I know this fucks him.
You should've seen his face when I told him
you'd give him his shooter down the road.
He's happy?
Yeah. He looked at me like a damn puppy.
-I'm sorry, Bunk.
-I'll carry it.
Fuck it.
No, tonight's mine.
Look, I'll tell you what, I'm going to roll out.
Here's the money
I would've spent on your ass.
Jimmy.
Call Nadine and tell her I caught one,
and I'm out on the street.
I lied for you, didn't l?
-You got a minute?
-Yeah, what's up?
I think I might have fucked something up.
Yeah?
I'm interviewing Omar, a few weeks back.
And he's giving it to me
that Bird is the shooter in the Gant case.
He tells me, if we catch up to Bird,
he'll have the gun on him.
Which he does.
But the thing is I told him that
we needed an eyeball witness.
At which point, he volunteers.
Maybe he saw it.
Or maybe he put himself in it
just to see Bird locked up.
I got the impression there
wasn't much love between them.
I fucked up, didn't l?
A little. But the gun matches.
And he's consistent with our witness
on the description and the scenario.
So, don't sweat it.
Kima.
You know, interrogation
is more art than science.
You've got to feel your way through
on instinct, mostly.
Come, take a look at this.
Who are they?
Some dancers who work at Barksdale's club.
I pulled their names
off of liquor board complaints...
and state employment records.
If you were going to try to turn
one these girls, which one would it be?
Her.
Why?
She doesn't have a record, for one thing.
She's just a DMV photo.
Why else?
I don't know. I can't really say.
I like her face.
Soul, conscience, whatever you want
to call it. She's a citizen, right?
It's in the eyes.
Instinct, Detective.
Yeah?
What?
Who is this?
He did?
How the hell did you get my number?
Yeah, okay.
Yeah.
-Ma'am?
-Get this crazy bastard out of here.
-What's the matter?
-He set off the smoke alarm, twice.
That good?
In the bathroom.
Bunk, it's Jimmy.
What the fuck?
Bunk, wake the fuck up.
-Bunk, wake up.
-What?
-The fuck are you doing?
-I hear you, Jimmy.
What are you doing?
Where are your fucking clothes?
Right here.
-Who gives a shit?
-Come on, man.
No.
What did you burn your clothes for, man?
Got hair, got fibers and...
got pussy on it and....
What, trace evidence?
You smell pussy?
I don't smell no pussy no more.
-Knock it off.
-I think you all can just take my ass home.
Trace lab ain't going
to have shit on the Bunk.
That shit. No fucking case file, Detective.
Where are your fucking shoes, man?
Ma'am, you seen his shoes?
Give me that pussy,
and now you going to take my shoes?
That ain't right, shit.
Shit.
Christ, Jimmy.
Bunk, I'll give you that
burning trace evidence makes sense.
What the fuck did you plan to wear home?
Shit.
Jimmy, you know something?
You're no good for people, man.
I mean, damn. Everybody around you....
Christ.
Him on the ball, from Dunbar.
He junior college now,
but he going to bigger places...
if he can make them grades.
He our edge, right there.
-Where he going?
-I don't know.
Terps, Hoyas, Missouri, Kansas,
they all want this cat.
Okay, so we in the mix, too, now.
You know what I'm talking about?
Blow Proposition Joe's mind.
He ain't got nobody balling like this.
He better not have one motherfucker
balling like this.
I'm tired of losing to
these Eastside bitches every year.
It's been three years running now, man.
Fucking with my morale, for real.
What happened to the faggot?
Omar?
-That nigger in the winds, man.
-What you mean he in the wind, man?
This city ain't that big.
You know what that nigger do
when he holed up somewhere?
He peel off one or two packages,
roll around the neighborhood...
giving away free vials and shit.
Yeah, on some real Robin Hood type shit.
If we try and get at him...
we going to have two dozen niggers
saying that we on our way.
If you want us to hunt that nigger,
we going to hunt.
But the smart play, I think, we call a truce...
put this thing on hold for a hot second.
Let the faggot get comfortable...
and when he do, he'll pop up his head.
Boom, we got him.
What will motherfuckers be saying
while we waiting?
What people going to say...
when they see this
cocksucking faggot out in the sunshine?
Like it ain't no thing to take my shit.
-Kid's everything I said he was?
-Yeah, he is straight.
Don't know what we're going to do
without him next year.
-How come you ain't signed?
-Lot of schools looking at me.
-I'm listening.
-$10,000, though, that ain't bad, right?
-It ain't.
-$10,000 for the kid, plus $5,000...
donation for the program.
Done.
Good. Give me 30 from the line
and get out of here.
Yo, man, good job, baby.
All right, big guy.
And I assume there's another $5,000
right here, for making this happen?
Ain't shit for free, right?
So, what you do for money?
Can't live without it, right?
You still fucked up
behind that stickup, man?
Shit ain't on you. It ain't on me neither.
Motherfucker who robbed
the stash shot Sterling.
He gonna get got
no matter what you or me do.
I just don't wanna play.
I don't wanna play no more.
All right?
I was thinking about going
to school, over at Edmondson...
ask if they'll let me back in
at the end of the semester.
-What grade?
-Ninth.
Ninth? Shit, you how old?
Sixteen.
Sixteen. Damn, man, you supposed
to be a junior by now.
I heard Stinkum got killed.
Yeah.
Damn.
-I said I don't want to play.
-I heard you.
And you ain't got to do nothing.
I heard you. Take it.
Hurry up, nigger, people looking.
Look here, man,
you a smart little motherfucker.
You start back up at Edmondson...
you likely to finish up at Harvard
or some shit like that. Believe, B.
And you got a good heart in there, too.
Not like the rest of these niggers.
-Yeah?
-Ronnie Mo on Tower Phone 2.
Right.
Where the fuck you at, man?
You coming to get this shit or what?
Keep cool, we making rounds.
-You know I ain't moving like I used to.
-All right, couple hours, we be at you.
All right.
Wee-Bey picking up at the towers?
-In a couple hours, give or take.
-Time enough for us to make a play.
What's up with Wallace?
Nothing.
Nothing?
Nothing.
It's all good, just leave him be.
Damn.
Fuck.
I'm tired of not having a phone
up in this joint.
-I'll be right back.
-Yeah.
-Have a nice hike.
-Yeah.
-Hello, you make order?
-Who this?
You make order? Good yakame.
-What?
-Or no delivery.
You make order, you come get.
Good yakame, good noodle.
Extra ketchup.
What the fuck was that?
That was my Korean counterman.
Sounded Chinese.
Like you can fucking tell the difference.
It's a brave new world for you, boys.
1 2-14.
-Request a lateral with 1 2-08.
-Go ahead, 14.
08, can you go to Channel 3?
1 2-08, I got that.
-Where you at?
-McCullough above Preston.
We're on a good pay phone
that the pit boys are now using.
I'm up on the church. Hang close, boys.
Might have a nicejack-up for you two.
I can't believe these boys
still in business, man.
-Testers, testers coming in five.
-What's the new package, man?
Yellow tops. Shit is the bomb.
-Now shit is the bomb.
-Check it.
A man who wants to get high
more than he wants to get clean.
-He was doing good, too.
-Told you, it was bullshit.
-Them meetings were just fronts.
-The man sounded strong, you know?
Whatever.
It's about that time.
-Shit.
-What happened?
That's the boy who beat me down, man.
The shits right here is
yellow tops and they right...
so remember where you caught this blast
and tell your fiend-ass friends.
Line the fuck up.
Back up.
Get in line, what the fuck? Line the fuck up.
Get the fuck out of here. Damn, fuck you all.
Hurry up. Over here.
Get one, girl, over here. I got one.
You get one?
Hold up. You catch one?
You know, I got three if you need.
You was at the meeting
over at Samuel Morse.
Mr. One-Day Man. It wasn't even that.
Stood up, though.
Why you down at the tester line
if you ain't chasing?
Trying to get my little nephew
off the corner.
His mama sent him up to Cumberland,
you know?
Try to keep him clean at my grandma's.
He ain't anywhere near his bottom.
Got to see that bottom coming up at him.
Hard, too, 'cause he's young, 24.
Most people don't get tired
till they're 35, 40.
-How old are you?
-Young at heart.
Walon, man.
Bubs.
Give them a long rope.
The farther away from the projects
you pop him, the less risk to the wire.
Hell with the wire.
Excuse me?
Gotcha, McNulty, you're too easy.
You can come at this a few ways.
First thing is we need the names
of all front companies...
Iimited partnerships,
LLCs, and all that mess.
-LLCs?
-Limited liability corporations.
Start with the nightclub
which Barksdale owns.
Look up Orlando's, by address, you
match it, and you see it's owned by who?
It's on Baltimore Street, right?
Got it. D & B enterprises.
Give it to Prez,
who's going to get off his ass...
and walk on over to
the state office buildings on Preston Street.
-Preston Street?
-Corporate charter office.
Corporate who?
They have the paperwork
on every corporation and LLC...
Iicensed to do business in the state.
You look up D & B Enterprises
on the computer.
You're going to get a little reel of microfilm.
Pull the corporate charter papers that way...
write down every name you see.:
corporate officers, shareholders,
or more importantly...
the resident agent on the filing
who is usually a lawyer.
While they use front names,
you know, as corporate officers...
they'll usually use the same lawyer
to do the charter filing.
Find that agent's name,
run it through the computer...
find out what other corporations
he's done the filing for...
and that way we find other front companies.
While he's doing that, what do I do?
You're gonna to keep your head
in this assessment book.
Look up any properties
that you can connect to Barksdale.
How do you know
it connects to Barksdale, right?
You work off of what Prez gets you
from the corporate charter documents.
Whatever companies he links to Barksdale
or people connected to him...
you look for those companies
in the city land records.
For example:
McNulty said that he heard that Barksdale...
owned an apartment building
up on Druid Park Lake.
You look up all the blocks on Reservoir Hill.
See if there's anything
owned by D & B Enterprises...
or any other company that Prez finds...
through corporate charter
or anything similar.
Ifyou find something that fits,
you write down the folio number...
so that you can look it up later
at the courthouse.
You don't find anything...
just take the names of all the corporate
listings for the multi-units near the lake.
You call that list over to Prez,
who pulls the charter papers...
and he'll look for connections.
-It's like a scavenger hunt.
-But what if Barksdale is careful?
I mean, what if we can't
find his name on anything?
In this country...
somebody's name
has got to be on a piece of paper.
A cousin, a girlfriend,
a grandmother, a lieutenant he can trust...
somebody's name is on a piece of paper.
And here's the rub:
You follow drugs...
you get drug addicts and drug dealers.
But you start to follow the money...
and you don't know where
the fuck it's going to take you.
While we're running around on this,
what are you going to do?
-You need something?
-Yeah.
Let me get the...
campaign financial reports
for the western districts...
and actually, any citywide race.
You want quarterly reports
or individual donor lists?
-Both, please.
-It'll be a couple hundred pages.
Really? I'll take all of it.
What the fuck, man?
With your right hand,
reach for the window, open the door.
-Come on, hurry up, man.
-Step out of the car.
Drop the cane, toss the cane.
Come around to the back.
All right.
Turn around.
Sir, is there anything in the vehicle
we should know about?
Nope.
No guns, drugs?
Me ain't got shit.
This money right here,
I didn't just pull this out of your truck?
What money?
Damn, we'll be counting
this limp-dick cash all day.
Where you guys going with all this?
Like the man said, it ain't ours.
It ain't yours?
So, you don't mind if we just
take it off your hands?
Do what you feel. You pretending to take
money out this truck.
I didn't even know it was there.
You know, I know how that shit is.
The other day,
I took up the sofa cushions off my couch...
found $1 .40 I didn't even know was there.
You all ain't got no charge, right?
No, fucker, we do not have a charge.
We just got your money.
You want it back, you can explain
it to the state's attorney where you got it.
You all enjoy your day now, you hear?
As I wake up in the morning
And get out of my bed
Give me three.
As I wake up in the morning
And get out of my bed
I'm thinking about the people
I grew up with long dead
The brothers I grew up with, locked up
I'm freestyling off the top of my head
You know, it's swell, Patti LaBelle I like her
But Regina Bell is better
Motherfucker!
Motherfucker, trying to steal our shit.
Motherfucker!
-Fished your wish, Bubbs?
-Yeah.
And you should've seen
the one that got away.
I nearly got killed behind this caper,
you know?
It's all in the game, Bubbs.
Yeah?
This ain't shit.
I'm not high, neither.
It's fucking Arm & Hammer.
We just been firing baking soda.
It's all right, man.
I'll just come up with another plan.
I did it once, right?
Fuck me.
Carv, you go to a restaurant...
and say the waitress gives you
good, decent service.
How much do you tip?
How much do I tip?
-For good service.
-I don't know, 15%.
-Some people tip 20%.
-Some people got money.
What you think Wee-Bey would tip?
You'd be a clever motherfucker
if there wasn't a wiretap running.
What do you mean?
Say we turn in $20,000, and this afternoon,
the bosses are listening to the wiretap...
and they hear we took $30,000
out of that car.
Didn't think of that, did you?
We're finding a lot of stuff
on the west side of downtown...
that might be his,
over by that Howard Street corridor.
-What kind of property?
-Low-rent commercials.
A lot of vacants.
The fuck does Avon Barksdale want
with a string of empty storefronts?
-This feels premature.
-What does?
Chasing up assets.
We're not close to putting
a charge to the man.
-That should be the priority.
-We put a charge to Avon Barksdale...
the Deputy shuts us down,
tells us to go home.
You want the money side of this case,
it's now or never, Lieutenant.
I'm working here.
Maybe $20,000 or $30,000.
Dollars for donuts.
You should've seen the looks on their faces.
-What did Wee-Bey say?
-"What money?"
The only hassle is
we need to sit here and count this shit.
-Do the ECU Submissions.
-And it's all limp-dick, dime-vial money.
Dirty bills right off the corner.
You all got the pit boys
on a fresh pay phone, right?
You all got the pit boys
on a fresh pay phone, right?
-Yeah, on McCullough.
-You take pictures?
Good, we're gonna need an additional
affidavit to get up on that phone.
Another 30 days, McNulty?
What the fuck did I do?
One day he fights,
the next day he's ready to roll over.
-Does he want this fucking case or not?
-Give him some slack, Jimmy.
He's wrestling with the angels on this one.
Where's my lucky pen?
-You ready, bitch?
-Yeah, I'm ready.
I wanna get on my knees
and suck you like a great big lollipop.
-Yeah, suck it.
-Yeah, I know that's your favorite.
Let me lick that. You like that?
I want you to butt-fuck me.
We're supposed to turn off the tap
when it's non-pertinent.
Fuck, no, this is too good.
-Fuck me.
-Daddy, yeah.
There's no way I'm transcribing this stuff.
Touch yourself.
Yeah.
-My pussy is so wet right now.
-Phone sex?
Shit was hilarious.
You're supposed to shut down
after 90 seconds if it's non-pertinent.
You're gonna to look like
a glazed donut, you know that?
Is that right?
I'm gonna get there and fuck you
in all three holes.
-So, you're gonna come past here?
-Tomorrow, yeah.
But I need to go past Argyle Street tonight.
-Check in with Wallace.
-Wallace?
He's off the hook since
we helped the tower crew...
get that stickup boy.
I'm telling you, Wallace is bugging.
Don't hardly even come
out of that room no more.
-Why he be like that?
-I think he might be getting high.
-Wallace?
-Boy scaring me with his shit.
-All right, you holler at me later.
-That'll work.
Pertinent now, right?
If you can explain
why we're still on the line...
after 10 minutes jerking off.
You got to justify that.
Maybe three holes was the code
for three stash houses.
Omar.
Omar coming.
-Did you hear me? I said Omar coming.
-Let's get out of here.
I said, Omar coming through.
Somebody in trouble now.
Come on, let's go.
You all need to open this door, man,
before I huff and puff.
Come on, now,
by the hairs of your chinny-chin-chin.
Omar, you best roll out,
we up in here with a MAC-10.
I thinks not, Terrell, I thinks not.
You all might need to think this through
and stop wasting my time.
Because Omar can come back tomorrow.
And the next day.
And the next day.
And I will put a bullet in all you all behind,
what happen right now, you heard?
Fair enough.
Here you go, keep it.
How do you wanna play it?
Hard and tight, like she's got no choice.
-Shardene Ennis.
-Miss, we need to talk.
-About what?
-It's a downtown talk.
This way. Come on.
Give me a two and two.
-What's up?
-What you got?
Family affair, two-for-one, you up?
-No. Not me.
-All right.
How you figure these little pebbles
get up on top of the roof?
Where's everybody at?
Maybe the whole thing is over
and no one bothered to tell us.
Maybe we won.
Something ain't right.
Come on, let's take a ride.
I like these.
-The toy furniture is great.
-Doll house miniatures.
It's a hobby.
My sister had a dollhouse
when we were young, but...
nothing as nice as these. Can l?
Sure, babe.
That's a walnut marble-top vanity.
Renaissance revival, late 19th century.
Do you have a house for them?
No, I just make them and sell them.
That seems kind of sad.
You should have a house for them.
We can use the Lieutenant's office.
-No.
-I ain't asked for nothing.
What's up, Tasha? You got too pretty, girl.
Go inside, Tash.
I'm thinking about getting clean.
Again.
I was thinking, you know,
I ain't got no other place to go, maybe....
That's wrong, right?
That ain't right, right? Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Wait.
Back door only.
There's an old sofa in the basement
and I'll throw you down some blankets.
You try to come up those stairs,
and I'm gonna call the police on you.
I swear I will.
West fucking Baltimore is on vacation.
No crews slinging in the low-rises,
the towers.
What the fuck?
-Who's playing who?
-West against East.
-Baltimore?
-The projects, man.
The bragging rights to the projects.
The projects got a ball team?
How long you been working at Orlando's?
-Four, five months.
-You like it?
-Pays the rent.
-You must see a lot there, I imagine.
What do you mean?
There's a lot of players there.
A lot of game being played.
I know nothing about that,
I just work for tips.
-For tips?
-Tips, drinks.
You know, I'm just a b-girl.
I don't mess with nothing beyond that.
Some of the girls in there,
they're into drugs and whatnot.
And some of them turn tricks
in the rooms upstairs but...
I mostly just stay at the bar.
Miss Ennis, it's rare
when we ask somebody...
to come on downtown with us
and we don't have a charge on them.
We don't tell them
what we're gonna talk about.
And they come along without complaining.
-That hardly ever happens.
-Rarely, if ever.
-I figure you got your reasons.
-The crew that runs Orlando's...
they've dropped about a dozen
bodies over the last year.
And they're running the drugs
in every housing project...
west of the Martin Luther King.
I don't know anything about that.
I just work for tips.
But now you do know,
because we're telling you.
You know a girl named Keisha Michaels?
-She dances with me.
-How's she doing?
All right, I guess.
Will you excuse us a moment?
-So, what do you think?
-I think she's a sweetheart.
I think if we push her hard, she'll tumble.
You want to show her the pictures?
I want to do better than that.
Come on, man, play defense.
-Let's go!
-"D" up, B.
-Who is he?
-That's Marcus Rivera, right there, man.
He out of Lake Clifton.
That nigger played in ltaly and shit.
Slim. What's up, man?
You got to go all the way
to Europe to get you a ringer?
No, he home now.
But I see you pulling boys
out the junior colleges.
He from Eastside, went to Dunbar.
What's up, playboy?
How come you wearing that suit?
It's 85 fucking degrees out here
and you trying to be like Pat Riley.
Look the part, be the part, motherfucker.
You walking around with
a fake fucking clipboard.
You can't even read a playbook.
Be for real. Bunch of bitches.
-Let's go.
-That was nice.
That boy was talking to God, right?
Ain't you all on the clock?
-Ain't you?
-We on break.
Then we on a break, too.
What's up with this game?
Just something we do every year,
you know?
Eastside versus Westside niggers.
Loser got to throw a big-ass party
at Druid Hill next weekend.
-Who's favored?
-Eastside won the last two years.
My boys.
Found nude Monday morning, in a Dumpster
off Reisterstown road, above Northern.
Toxicology is positive
for heroin and cocaine.
-In a Dumpster?
-Rolled up in a rug.
She overdosed and whoever
was with her didn't do shit...
but roll her up and throw her away.
Because that's how they do.
Positive for semen in vaginal,
anal and oral cavities.
Three different blood types, all secretors.
They fucked her and threw her away.
The only reason we knew who she was,
or what she was about...
or what she might mean
to someone like you...
is because we've been
keeping an eye on the people...
who run Orlando's for some time now.
We got ways of knowing
what they're saying...
what they're thinking.
You know what they said about this one?
That the stupid bitch didn't know how good
the snort was at Little Man's party.
That it was her own fault.
That's how they do it.
They use people,
and when they throw them away...
they find a way to say it ain't on them.
Lying motherfucker.
He said they took her to a hospital.
Now, get back on "D."
Check out Avon. He's freaking.
Shit, man, we got to win this one.
I think Avon's here.
-Where?
-Like I know what he looks like?
He's a black guy rooting for Westside.
We might have a visual on Avon.
Street ball game up at Cloverdale.
-Where's Greggs and Freamon?
-Pressing the stripper they picked up.
You and Carver stay on the radio.
-We should follow him.
-Why?
He ain't gonna touch drugs or money
anywhere you can see him, Lieutenant.
In Narcotics we follow guys.
We do it well, we make cases on it.
Mount up.
We been on this guy three months.
Don't you even want to get a look at him?
I wouldn't know Avon Barksdale
if I fell over him in the street.
The thing is, I don't need to.
We get him by voice alone
or we don't get him.
Yeah, baby!
Half-time.
You got yourself a fine ringer.
It's not your year,
you know what I'm talking about?
-It look that way, but you never know.
-I know, man, we up 1 2.
Yeah, you is, but...
I got a proposition for you.
-Okay.
-Double down?
Let's give this wager a clean six figures.
You serious?
I don't give a fuck. It's your money.
You can waste it if you want,
you know what I'm talking about?
-Anyone got him?
-64-Charlie to central K.
1 2-10.
12-10.
1 2-10.
You have him?
Lieutenant, I don't even know
what I'm looking for.
Got him marked.
On the sideline, red shirt, white visor.
I think he's coaching or something.
Who this fucking midget?
Get that midget out of here, B.
-Why you holler at me?
-Man, we getting down to it.
-I get to you when I get to you.
-That's it, we're on the stash.
We are?
How can you put that down
when Sydnor wasn't on the roof?
Yes, he was.
No, he's not, he's with Daniels.
No, he isn't.
-Get the fuck out of here.
-Ref, what the fuck?
What the fuck?
Ref, what the fuck?
The boy was fouled. Clear, straight up!
How you going to not call that?
If you want, I can put time
back on the clock and replay it.
You talking about a do-over?
Talking about a fucking do-over?
That's not how the game is played!
You can't do that!
Believe this shit?
Nigger talking about doing it again.
-I don't want any trouble, okay?
-Ain't going to be no trouble over no ball.
Man, you supposed to be the ref, right?
Why don't you stand up
for your fucking self? You pussy.
You can't let any old motherfucking nigger
get in your face, you understand?
Now, walk away.
Turn around and walk the fuck away.
Ignorant motherfucker.
-We cool?
-Yeah, we cool, baby.
You tell your people to come to the park,
Saturday at noon.
Of course you come
on the Westside again, without a ball...
I'm gonna light your ass up.
-D'Angelo?
-You know him?
At this point, it feels like I do.
We sort of moved in together.
He seemed like he was different.
-I have to quit the club.
-Yes, you do. But not just yet.
We need your help.
Which is why we came to you.
-I don't know what else--
-Keisha was not the first.
Unless somebody steps up a little bit,
she's not going to be the last neither.
You like that one?
Why don't you keep it?
Thank you.
-He's getting into a black Ford Excursion.
-Copy that.
He's pulling out, north on Collington.
He's pulling out, north on Collington.
11-71.
You got the parallel on the north,
I got him on the south.
1 1-71, I got him.
Looks like he's going east on Oliver.
He just parked. East of Oliver.
1 2-10, you keep the eyeball.
1 1-71, take up a position on Federal,
west of Montford.
I'm coming up from the south.
1 1-71, I copy that.
He's just sitting there.
-He's doubling back.
-Copy.
He's south on Montford.
He jumped the light at Preston and Milton
and is south on Milton.
Be advised that he didn't make it to Chase.
1 1-71, what's your status?
He couldn't have gone past us.
11-71, nothing on this side.
Must have went to ground.
All right, hold your positions.
I'll take a look.
-He called again, same pay phone.
-Same voice?
It was the main stash house, it's got to be.
The pattern fits.
-Who took the call at the projects?
-Who knows?
There was no one on the roof.
Sydnor was off with Daniels,
chasing Avon in the street.
We had a good day, too.
Kima turned one of the dancers
over at Avon's club.
The one who's fucking D'Angelo.
This guy's good.
We threw everything we had at him.
You know what they say,
stupid criminals make stupid cops.
You know what they say,
stupid criminals make stupid cops.
I'm proud to be chasing this guy.
We got four front companies so far,
buying up all kinds of shit.
A club, an apartment building,
a funeral home...
and a lot of real estate on the west side
of downtown by the Howard Street corridor.
Shop fronts and warehouses.
-Barksdale's name on it?
-Fronts, mostly. Relatives, some.
Mind if I have a seat?
He's had the projects for more than a year
and it's a money factory.
We popped Wee-Bey coming out
the other day with $22,000.
The boys talking on the wire
were saying it wasn't much of a loss.
$22,000?
That's just from one morning
from the towers and the pit.
Add the avenue corners,
you're probably up near $30,000.
Another take for the evening, $60,000.
-A day?
-That's $25 million a year, conservatively.
You take out 20%
for running expenses and spillage...
and you are still clearing
$1 million a month.
-So, where's it all go?
-He shows no flash.
He's got no house, no car in his name...
no jewelry, no clothes.
Just front companies and the property.
And political contributions.
$75,000 the last month alone...
all from his front companies
or their listed officers.
And that's just at a quick glance.
I'm just totaling up the legal contributions.
You've got the likes of Damien Price,
aide to a state senator...
driving out $20,000 in cash
from the projects...
whenever he feels it.
I know you don't want
to hear this, Lieutenant...
but the money is real and it's everywhere.
And more than the drugs,
it's the money that matters.
I ain't fucked nobody else
if that's what you thinking.
All right, I mean, fuck it.
If you want to go, then go!
But you could give me a goddamn reason.
-What do I look like to you?
-What you mean?
-What do I look like to you?
-You look like a girl, a woman...
a beautiful woman, you're fine, what?
I don't look like trash to you?
Baby, this ain't about what you do.
I don't look like something
you could roll up in a rug...
and throw in the trash?
Shardene.
Lieutenant, you paged us?
We were almost home.
Sit.
-Yeah? Checked my count again, yo.
-How bad?
Not too bad, man.
-We got hit about $22,000.
-$22,000? That's all?
All right.
I got towers two, three, five and six...
and another one labeled "P" for the pit.
Where's one and four? It's on the wire
that we took them for $22,000.
You shitheads turned in $15,000.
Where's the rest?
-Lieutenant, we ain't got--
-You have till roll call tomorrow...
to crawl back to whatever rock
you hid it under.
It comes back and it goes to ECU.
This doesn't happen.
Not with me. Not with my unit.
I wouldn't steal and not tell you about it.
This some of Avon's shit.
You got Avon Barksdale chasing
your ass all around town...
and you still find time to take his shit.
-It's your shit now.
-What I want with that?
What anybody want with that, man?
-How much you asking?
-We free.
Free?
I'm saying, I got a little proposition for you.
Proposition is,
you get four G-packs for free...
you give me some better idea
on how I can reach Avon.
-How to contact him?
-You all just had a game, right?
-How you get a hold of him to parley?
-We talk now and then.
I page his ass.
Okay.
That all you need?
-A number?
-I make do with it.
And a code for one of his peoples.
What Wee-Bey use, 07?
07.
What makes you think
I ain't gonna take this off your hands...
and throw your ass up outta here?
Come on, man, Avon goes down,
the projects be open market again, right?
Let me understand.
Avon loses $100,000 to me on a bet...
then you bring me some of his shit...
so that I can put
your predatory self on his ass.
Not his day, is it?
Fuck.
Fuck it.
-Where was it?
-The wheel well.
You remember when the bag broke?
Think Daniels will believe it?
Would you?
You didn't believe me.
I'm sorry.
Savino late, man.
I'm ready to make this money-run,
get the fuck out here.
-You tired?
-I'm tired, man, I'm hungry.
Shit, me too.
Want something to eat from the diner?
Yeah, you going over there?
Get me a cheese steak, man.
-You hungry, too?
-Yeah, I could do a burger.
All right.
-Let me get onions on that, man.
-I got you.
You organizing it right?
You got my $50s with my $50s,
and my $100s with my $100s?
All right, ladies, good night.
I see you all tomorrow, on time, you hear?
Count this money, baby.
-What the fuck?
-Who's that?
Wee-Bey swinging me an emergency call.
Fuck.
Bey?
91 1 call.
No. We got rules, right?
Fuck.
They had cheese fries, baby. I got you some.
Avon, stay down, man. I got you covered.
This is the second time this week...
I had to pay for a sitter
'cause he was workin' late.
With all that money he make,
you can afford it.
Lord.
What's up, Bubs?
Hey.
There you go.
-What you got?
-I got some starters.
My fault, A.
-Should've never left you alone, homie.
-No, shit.
Man, you ain't pull up when you did,
I'm gone.
Listen, what I want to know is how
we fucking come back on this cocksucker?
We don't. Not now.
You feel me?
Listen, Stringer,
your advice was good advice...
you know what I'm saying?
I wanna let you know that.
What I want you to do now
is put the word out there.
I want you to let him know
we willing to squash this, if he is.
And then what the fuck if he ain't?
No, this nigger live in the town, too.
He gonna listen, if we parley.
And then when he creep out
of his hole, and shit.
-Boom.
-Okay.
-Smoke him.
-Say no more, got you.
-Put that out there, yo.
-All right.
About them police, though,
they was on your ass after the game?
Yeah, man, it was like two cars.
See, if they on you, then they got a name.
If they got a name,
then they know you got no license.
But they don't want no traffic charges,
you know what I'm saying?
They don't want no humble shit.
I think they was trying
to see where I might go.
Where the fuck was you
gonna take their asses?
I was taking them to the barbershop.
I was going to get a haircut.
Get a fade?
I know, B, but these motherfuckers
are on us. Fuck.
They always have been on us,
we just gotta be careful.
You not been talking on any phones.
And you not been touching any drugs.
And from now on,
you are not doing the money runs.
Me and Bey, we gonna take care
of that shit...
until this whole thing cool off.
-Let me get that pager.
-What's up, you serious?
Serious. I'm gonna get you
a New York supply number only.
Any of these motherfucking local cats...
wanna talk to you, they gotta talk to me.
We gotta build a wall around you, B.
Another month on a fresh phone?
They ripped out the pay phones
in the low-rises.
Now they're walking a block or two.
How much longer
until you bring this case in?
The quicker you can the better
for everybody. Yourself included.
Look at this.
Judge Gwynn sends his regrets.
He can't make lunch.
Like I suddenly got the plague.
There's your new phone. 30 days.
A few weeks ago, when Burrell
wanted to take down the wire...
you were the one breaking off on his ass.
Jimmy, there's a lady here.
Rhonda talks more trash than both of us,
Your Honor.
I have never been
anything other than ladylike, Your Honor.
Detective McNulty is going out of his way
to insult an officer of the court.
-McNulty, I hold you in contempt.
-Who doesn't?
What's with him?
-You haven't heard?
-No.
-What's wrong with the picture?
-Don't know.
-Phelan isn't in it.
-What, he's up for election?
I thought judges had 15-year terms.
They do, but Phelan was named
to finish Halpern's term...
which only had two years left.
So he has to run on his own in the primary.
What, he's not on the ticket?
Why the fuck not?
Maybe it's the company he keeps.
Fuck.
No, see, you ain't thinking about
how much room the baby gonna need.
Specially when he get to growing...
'cause there are things we got to have.
Like a real crib, a play desk...
and you know, he got to have
one of them Little Tikes cars.
I'm not saying your place
ain't nice enough...
'cause for you, it do just fine,
but if we gonna be a family...
'cause for you, it do just fine,
but if we gonna be a family...
we need at least one more room, if not two.
So you add the bedroom set,
a nice bedroom set like the one they got...
down at that baby store on Howard Street,
and that's a room right there.
And I think we might
get some better furniture...
and put your stuff in the other bedroom...
Iike it was a den...
'cause the sofa you got seen better days...
I think you know that much.
Dee, where you goin' at?
I told you I need money
for the new bedroom set. Dee!
-Why you holler at me?
-Yo, man, we getting down to it.
I get to you when I get to you.
That's the main stash house.
Say what?
The incoming call is the guy who runs
the main stash for Barksdale's people.
-Who is he?
-We don't know.
So, y'all are just guessing
he's on the stash, right?
No, he's on it.
Lester was checking the logs
when he picked up the pattern.
Every time they get down
to the ends on a package...
somebody in the tower
hits that pager number.
Then, within a half-hour
every fucking time...
a call comes back to the tower pay phone
from that number in Pimlico.
Which is?
It's a pay phone at a Mondo Mart
in Reisterstown on Cold Spring Lane.
You see it now?
When the supply gets low,
they page this mope...
who always calls back from a pay phone
way the fuck out in north-west.
Same phone, same pattern.
So y'all think that
he's taking the re-up order...
and that the stash is somewhere
near the Mondo Mart, right?
-You are on it, Detective Sydnor.
-Okay, so what do you do with this?
What do we do?
We're gonna be sittin'
on that phone in Pimlico...
all day and night
waitin' on Mr. Mondo Mart.
-Herc, too.
-Herc's out this whole week.
-In-service training.
-That's too bad.
So, instead of three eight-hour shifts,
you two are gonna have to pull 1 2 hours.
Just fucking kill me now.
-Heard from Omar?
-Nope.
I'm gonna go try to scare him up.
Where you gonna be?
Everyone on the wire keeps talking about...
how this kid's all tore up
about the dead stickup boy.
-I'm gonna see for myself.
-All right.
-You need us, we're on the radio.
-Okay.
Hey, what up, man?
This first time,
I can go four ounces of rock...
but hey, if the shit is right,
then next time I can step that up.
Almost ain't worth it for four.
Just this first go-round.
You do right by me,
I'll turn around and come back on it.
Where your money at, man?
We good.
So, where the shit at?
Ain't nobody been there but you.
Nobody came in my house but you.
Everybody.
Nobody but you. You're the only person
that came in my house.
So, what you got goin' for you?
Ain't got nothing left, burnt it away.
Family?
Mother dead. Father, who the fuck know.
Brothers, sisters?
A sister, she lets me stay in the basement...
but she lock the door so I can't go upstairs.
About the best she can do for me.
Got a kid, a son.
Imagine me bringing life into the world.
-What's his name?
-Keyshawn.
His mother took him up Jersey way,
said I wasn't fit to be with the boy.
-I didn't disagree.
-Well...
at least you got your health.
Here's to health.
I got the bug.
Had it since '94.
Gave that shit to my old lady.
Worried about passing it on to my baby girl.
No, I was spared that at least.
Damn, how do you carry it?
-You ask her forgiveness?
-Of course.
-What she say?
-What she needed to say.
Look, forgiveness from other folks is good...
but ain't nothing but words
coming at you from outside.
You wanna kick this shit,
you got to forgive your own self.
Love yourself some, brother.
And then drag your sorry ass
to some meetings.
-Meetings?
-What the fuck you wanna hear?
That you're strong enough
to do this by yourself?
Getting clean's the easy part.
Now comes life.
It's this one here with the orange cord
coming out of the back.
They're pirating juice from the other house.
You fucking gotta be kidding me.
Now I'm policing for BGE?
They're not there yet,
but when this kid here posts, snatch him up.
Park our asses outside this shit-hole and
wait for some little project yo to raise up?
Mrs. McNulty raised no fools.
Four Faidley's crabcakes in the bag...
24 Dutch beers in the box.
Faidley's? You all right, McNulty.
Faidley's? You all right, McNulty.
I don't care what all them
other fucks downtown say about you.
1 1-35, what's up?
Our friend wants to meet. Same spot.
-Copy that, 15 minutes.
-What's the deal with the yo-boy?
-What'd he do?
-Stumbled into my world.
-Five minutes, come on.
-I have to go.
-Shardene.
-I said, I have to go.
-I can't have five minutes?
-No, not right now.
Fuck!
How close did you get?
Y'all be chalking that nigger if Wee Bey
ain't pop up at the last second like....
Remember when we last talked?
You were gonna lay back,
let us work our case.
I said, I'd do what I can.
Still, I thought I might let y'all know
Avon's people got in contact...
talking about they want to end the beef.
-They offered me some kind of amnesty.
-Amnesty?
Look, I chill out on the manhunt
and stop hitting them in the head...
for their product,
they gonna call off the bounty.
Take the truce, Omar.
I might, if they ain't trying to play me.
-They said they want to parley on it.
-Parley?
Look, I don't know, man, but right now
I need some assistance from y'all.
Yo, son, I go to the ER,
and word get back to Avon...
you know he gonna have his henchmen
waiting in the parking lot for me.
Look, I know y'all friendly
with a couple of doctors, right? Right?
He says he can buy weight.
Says he runs with some decent-size locals.
-Like who?
-Avon, something.... Barksdale.
Avon Barksdale?
Run it through the DECS and HIDA.
See what comes back.
I'm gonna check around,
see if anybody's working...
these names you gave us.
If you full of shit, pal,
I'm gonna know it quick.
But what happens to me
while you checking?
Eager Street. City jail, motherfucker.
Blue came home last week.
I ain't seen him since.
Yeah.
I can't believe it.
-Damn, Carv, you's triflin'.
-Yeah, I admit it, I'm disgusting.
Cheese puffs and fucking Ring-Dings?
Yeah.
-Yeah.
-The big fuck from the high-rise...
-what's his name?
-Little Man.
-Yeah, him.
-All right.
-Yo.
-Be ready, we're on it.
Look at this pretty motherfucker.
Too fucked up to drive home, McNulty?
Hey, Bunk.
Kid gave us a murder.
More than that, he's put in Stringer Bell.
Yeah?
Picks out Wee-Bey, Bird
and Stinkum from photo arrays.
Puts them all up at the Greek's...
the night they grab up Omar's boy, Brandon.
Puts Bell in the truck, too.
Says, "Stringer told me
to point out the stickup boy."
-Jeez, what do you have over him?
-Not a fucking thing.
Kid was ready, barely had to push him.
-Whose case?
-Norris's.
-How old?
-16.
Lives in a shit-hole vacant over on Argyle.
When I grab him up,
I swear he's halfway into a nod.
Using?
When they kill the stickup boy
the fuckers dump the body in the alley...
behind where this kid and all the other
low-rise hoppers lay their heads.
Can you imagine?
All he can think about.
You tell him he's gonna have to testify?
Not yet, we'll get there.
Problem is, what do we do with him now?
-Yeah.
-Big boy picking up.
Okay.
-You holler at me, right?
-Where you at, man? We on our way down.
First thing tomorrow, man.
-Yeah?
-It's him, stay on it.
All right.
I didn't do nothing, man, get me outta here.
The 2-2, grounded slowly towards third,
and it gets through at the last moment.
Where my phone call at?
Suzuki's at the plate, here's the pitch.
Line drive, up the middle,
a base hit for Suzuki.
Suzuki's very patient at the plate.
Yeah, man, it's me.
Guess who's up in here.
Pimpin'-ass Orlando, from the club.
Yeah. Courtside.
-So, how long you been slingin'?
-Since I was, maybe, 1 2.
And how long were you
with Barksdale's crew in the low-rises?
With D'Angelo? Not long.
He came down from the towers
at the beginning of the summer.
Before that I worked for Ronnie Mo.
D'Angelo ever talk to you
about what happened in the 221 building...
with Pooh getting shot?
How about anything else like that?
-Like what?
-Killings, murders.
He say anything about a girl getting shot
in an apartment up on the Eastside?
He--
No, Dee, he was good to me. He all right.
But D'Angelo, he was who you called
that night when you saw...
the stickup boy at the Greek's, right?
Yeah, but he didn't go up there.
It was mostly those tower boys.
And Stringer.
You said Stringer was in the truck.
He called you over,
asked you to point out the stickup boy.
All of it corroborated by the beeper logs...
and the pen registers
from the project pay phones.
Stinkum's dead.
We've already got Bird for the Gant killing.
-This ties them all in.
-D'Angelo, too.
Maybe, but since he didn't show
at the Greek's...
he tells the jury
he didn't see the murder coming.
It's enough to charge him, anyway.
Parents?
Alcoholic mother.
In the wind, no fixed address.
Says he's got a grandmother
on the Eastern Shore...
but he hasn't seen her in years.
-How about a hotel room?
-On whose dime?
No way the Deputy approves the manpower
to stash a 16-year-old...
much less the room service.
McNulty, Line 2.
How about you run this up to front office?
See if the state's attorney will kick in.
He's a kid, Cedric.
Even if we clear the money,
do you really wanna put a juvenile...
in a hotel for six months
waiting on a trial date?
I think you all need to get
with Grandma down on the shore.
Now? She's doing this right now?
They don't have to set a hearing date
or something like that?
Christ, yeah, okay. Yeah.
I fuckin' need a fuckin' lawyer.
What?
Still, you can see that
they got the security bars...
and look there.
Cameras that see over the yard
out to the street.
And I checked with Verizon,
there's no phone service at that address.
That's a telltale right there.
So what? We try to write a warrant
for this place, right?
Right?
-What are you seeing?
-No pattern, really.
Except this cluster of old storefronts...
and warehouses
on the west side of downtown.
Around Paca, Utah, Howard Street, mostly.
-Storefronts?
-Vacants, usually.
Three different holding companies.
-Detective Pryzbylewski.
-What?
You have a gift for the paper trail.
Tomorrow calls for some street work,
though. Are you street ready?
You know the Lieutenant has me in-office.
I don't have my gun until the grand jury.
-You won't need one.
-On the street? No gun?
No gun. Not for this.
Furthermore, Mr. McNulty,
having utilized his sons...
in an act of police work
involving a criminal suspect...
actually lost track of them
in a crowded municipal market.
This is simply unacceptable, Your Honor.
Be that as it may,
an emergency ex parte order...
is an extraordinary request, Mr. Palmer.
You actually want me to limit visitations
to afternoons only, and you want...
Mrs. McNulty present at all visitations?
Come on.
It is not a single lapse, Judge.
Mr. McNulty has time and again
failed to properly care for the children...
when they're in his custody.
I have a list of recent events, Your Honor,
that justify an order.
Ms. Pearlman, you have a response
you'd like to offer up here?
Nope.
Nothing?
If this were possession with intent,
I'd be a prosecutor with a plan.
But a domestic order hearing?
Your Honor, I'm officially clueless.
In fact, as an employee of the state,
I should not actually be here.
All right, listen up, people...
before you have me make a ruling
on an emergency petition...
everybody here just needs
to take a deep breath.
Literally, come on.
Now, then, is Mr. McNulty capable...
of having a civil conversation
with Mrs. McNulty?
Yes, Your Honor.
And is Mrs. McNulty equally capable
of having a conversation with Mr. McNulty?
-Yes.
-Good, then I'm going to lunch.
Let's see when I return
if we can't busy this court...
with something just a little more engaging
than the problems of the McNultys.
Look, the charge is on me.
I understand that, I'll carry that.
But the least our people can do...
is throw down a little something
to pay the bondsman.
That's the deed of transfer for the club.
The other thing is a license transfer
application for the liquor board.
They're both backdated
and notarized for last week.
What?
A front has to be clean.
And right now, you ain't that. Sign.
I want my bail paid.
You send me a bondsman, I'll sign.
Is that what you want me to tell him?
That I asked you to sign and you wouldn't?
You wanted to be in the game, right?
Now you're in the game.
Unbelievable. You show up with her?
Elena, you went for an emergency ex parte.
I grabbed whatever lawyer
was standing around.
She was standing?
Ask her if she wants the pictures back.
Let's see, I've got her at the restaurant
with you pulling out her chair.
I've got her at the motel parking lot
with you opening the car door for her...
because you're such
a fucking gentleman now.
I can't believe you hired Buckman.
Son of a bitch never made
a case that counted.
He caught your cheating ass.
Elena, why are we here?
Because you can't have
Sean and Michael around criminals.
You can't lose them
in a Baltimore market. That's why.
He wasn't a criminal.
I know the guy.
It was a game we were playing.
It was daylight on a crowded street.
They could've been following AI Capone.
It would've been fine.
Look, Elena, these are my sons.
I love them. Do you hear, I love them.
I'm not gonna let them get hurt.
I love you, too.
Still do.
Does she know
about the detective and the pictures?
No, why would I tell her about that?
And are the two of you still....
No.
Yes.
A little.
Come on, let's make nice for the judge.
Okay.
We know we have a month more to go
and we're not gonna let up.
We are going to raise more,
we are going to spend more...
and on Election Day,
we are going to be out there...
pushing the vote in every precinct.
You ready?
Come on, we'll get dinner first.
Ain't so hungry.
Come on.
How much were you using?
I'm asking if you're gonna be sick in my car.
A cap now and then.
You just snorting?
You'll be all right in a day or two. Come on.
This nigger coming or what, man?
Said he would, if I guaranteed a parley.
And I'm here on it.
Of course, he said you would be
paying my fee rather than his own self.
Your fee?
I'm doing like one of them
marriage counselors.
Charge by the hour to tell some fool
he need to bring some flowers home.
Then charge another hour telling the bitch...
she ought to suck some cock
every little once and a while.
To keep a marriage strong like that.
Speaking of cocksuckers.
-Don't believe we met.
-Proposition Joe.
You ever steal from me,
I kill your whole family.
All right. You all both here on my guarantee,
so respect that shit and say what you feel.
I'm up out of here.
I got a man who say he gonna
give you your life back.
Who, Barksdale?
My man say, "Tell that motherfucker that...
"if he can find a way
not to dip in our pockets...
"we're gonna call this shit even."
You all aced Bailey,
and what you did to my boy?
So, y'all think after what you did to Brandon
we supposed to find some even on this?
I don't know shit about shit, all right?
I'm just the messenger.
Whatever, man.
You know there's dead on both sides, right?
And there's gonna be a whole lot more
if this beef keep up.
But the truth be told, there be more soldiers
on one half than the other.
You know what I'm saying?
Look here, son, you tell Barksdale...
that he's been paid back
for what he did to my peoples.
But as for his product,
a man's got to earn a living, you know?
I don't know nobody called Barksdale, B.
The man I'm talking about can't have
his shit taken like that. That won't do.
All right, tell him to throw me
some cash then, and we'll see....
About $5,000 or $10,000.
You know what I mean,
for my retirement, homes.
-$5,000 ifyou can keep quiet about it.
-Send my money through Joe, man.
You go through Joe,
you're not gonna see $2,000 of that.
-Why don't you tell my man where you at--
-No.
We gonna figure
something else out, you hear?
I'll be in touch, homes.
How careful is Stringer Bell?
"I don't know no one named Barksdale."
Shit.
Still, we got him tied to the Brandon killing.
That can be enough for one day's work.
Did what I could for y'all.
You sure, right?
Yeah, I spent a summer here
when I was nine.
When was the last time they saw you?
When I was nine.
-What's that?
-What?
That noise.
It's crickets.
-Cricket.
-Crickets.
-He try to go in my pockets again?
-This nigger is talking about $5,000, B.
Shit.
What's up, baby?
Antwon said to bring these up.
You want anything else?
No, we cool.
I'm saying though,
how we supposed to pay that?
He talking about going through Joe,
but I'm like, fuck Joe.
Thank you, you know what I mean?
You look good and your services
are appreciated.
Keep them tips,
I hope you making them, baby.
Make the motherfucker
come down to the towers...
Make the motherfucker
come down to the towers...
to get the rest of his money,
know what I'm saying?
If he's stupid enough to come
to the towers, he gonna get got.
It's a wrap. How we supposed to pay that?
All right.
Y'all think you can hang, but, look.
No, you see, I went to journalism school.
All right? Northwestern.
So you all can't stay with me on this....
Girl, you talking like
you some crusty old reporter.
-Excuse me?
-Bitch, you work at a TV station.
It's the same thing, all right?
Look, come on, stop talking.
Here we go.
-Bring it.
-Come on, Kima.
I gotta work tomorrow.
Candy ass.
That's all I have to say.
-Okay, you see?
-I'm with you.
All right.
Look at Tanya.
And she run a damn art gallery.
You see, police in this town ain't about shit.
-Guess not.
-Thank you.
Can't hold a liquor.
Can't hold a donut.
And if you ask me, I guess we...
ain't good in bed, either.
Don't go there, Officer. Don't go there.
Kima, how did you know
you wanted to be a cop?
I mean, how did you choose that?
When you were little,
did you think about it at all, or....
Come on, Kima.
I remember when I was in the Northeast,
still field-training as a cadet.
I didn't know if I was gonna
stick with it or not.
And then we got this one call.
We chased this purse-snatcher
up into these apartments.
I got separated from my FTO.
Shit, I ain't even no police yet.
You know, I'm just a trainee. And I'm alone.
Anyway, I mean,
I don't know how, but I find the guy.
So I catch him and I hold on to him
and I manage to get to my radio.
We in the middle of this parking lot
and we're rolling around...
and this motherfucker's
steady kicking my ass trying to get away.
I look over and I see these black patents
and these uniform blue pants.
I look up and it's Charlie Smoot...
Charlie fucking Smoot.
You know, this guy's a legend.
He looks down at me and he smiles,
you know real quiet-like.
And he drops his cuffs.
He says, "Here you go, rook."
That's all he says.
"Here you go, rook."
And then he dropped
the bracelets and walked away.
I mean, I know you don't like it.
But shit, I was proud.
God damn.
Lester says we ain't gonna
write a warrant on this place.
-How do we not with all this PC?
-We're on the main stash, right?
Why would we kick the door in...
when all we have to do
is park a van down the street...
follow the entire Westside drug supply
in and out of the place?
We're gonna start picking up
pieces of Barksdale's world...
we never even knew about.
Been hell looking for you people.
What the hell's the name
of this unit anyway?
Shit, Kima in the house.
What's up, Wig?
State police, CID, out of Pikesville.
Name of Troy Wiggins,
but pay no attention to the man...
because he about 90-95% pure bullshit.
Kima, she just talk like that
because I had her when she was good.
Shit, you the ugly-ass motherfucker
turned me the other way.
Shit, all right.
Here's the thing, boys and girls.
I'm doing a reverse buy-down
in Arundel, right?
And I get this Westside asshole
nibbling on four ounces, right?
-A whole four ounces?
-I know, he ain't much, but...
I get him in the boat
and he starts flopping around...
saying he can buy weight from some
motherfucker, name of Barksdale.
I never heard of no Barksdale.
But I put the name into DECS.
And the computer has Avon Barksdale
entered as an active Baltimore city target.
So I go down to City Narcotics, and Dawson,
he sends me down here to see y'all.
So what's the name of your fish?
Wendell O., as in...
oh-shit-l-tried-to-buy
from-a-state-police Blocker.
That wouldn't be
Wendell "Orlando" Blocker, would it?
Yeah. You on it.
Orlando.
They keep that back room locked.
And even if I do get back there
on an errand, then they kind of shut down.
They get real quiet.
You said you heard one say
something about...
making someone come into the towers.
-Yeah.
-Which one was talking?
He was tall, I think.
All right, but who else was there?
I don't really see that well
without my glasses.
Where are your glasses?
You can't see faces without those?
You don't wear those while you're working,
do you, darlin'?
Would you? I gotta live off drinks and tips.
-No way.
-Why not?
Because a player wouldn't be
the name on the liquor license.
He'd have a connect for Barksdale's coke.
He wouldn't walk into state troopers.
He got a charge and now
he's talking out his ass.
You're never gonna get Avon
or Stringer in the same room as the dope.
-We make this case on their voices alone.
-So maybe he can't buy from Barksdale.
Maybe he can only buy
from Savino or Wee-Bey.
Fuck him, then.
We already got Wee-Bey tied to a murder,
and Savino's the runt of the litter.
We can take what Orlando
gives us about the club.
The money laundering, maybe, or the girls.
For that kind of cooperation,
I'll drop a few years and call it fair.
-Daniels in here?
-Yeah.
Call from Deputy Commissioner for you.
You want it in here?
No.
He doesn't miss much.
-I need some help here.
-Come on, Bubs.
You got me coming across town
in the middle of a fucked-up workday...
just so you can hold $10,
that shit ain't right.
Hold on, I don't need $10, okay?
I don't know. I need a place of my own.
All right? Some bed,
some sheets, some clothes.
I definitely need some new clothes.
How long you been clean?
Three days.
You serious about it?
Who knows?
What the fuck am I gonna do
with a clean informant?
Did you think about that?
All right, I'm on it with you.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
What the fuck, give me some love.
Okay, I mean, I think I can get,
you know, a mattress, my own place...
everything for like a couple hundred dollars.
All right. We'll talk.
I gotta be somewhere tonight,
so hit me on my page tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
I got you.
-The cooperator says he can buy weight.
-Not from Barksdale or Bell.
How can you be sure?
How much dope or coke do you think
gets Avon Barksdale into the room?
A kilo? 2 kilos? 20 kilos?
We are not going to buy
our way up the ladder here.
These people do not touch the drugs.
They don't go near the drugs.
The wire is what gives us Barksdale.
It gives us the whole crew.
Day by day, piece by piece.
Buy-bust, Lieutenant.
It's what I asked you for months ago.
It's what we do successfully...
time and again to make these cases.
Why New York?
Must be something happening out there.
Too big a town, you know what I mean?
-You don't believe in the truce?
-That's why I asked for that money.
If he had said,
"We ain't paying, just be happy to live"...
I'd have been like, they keeping it real.
But he say, come on down for $5,000.
I'm, like, man, please.
Look here, homes, I ain't asked for much,
but I'm a little light on traveling money.
I'm saying, I could go around the block
and get myself paid, but I'm thinking.
You keep in touch with my pager.
We're gonna need you for the Gant trial.
Go easy, Omar.
Stay free.
You be picking me up outside
the cut-rate on Lex and Fulton.
I be up there after 10.:00, right?
That'll work.
Listen up, people.
We've got $30,000 in buy money,
courtesy of our friends over at DEA.
But the thing is,
they can't have that money walking on them.
Definitely not.
So Kima will be in the car for the buy,
fronting as our Cl's girl.
Looking the part, too.
Now, where's your weapon gonna be?
He might pat me,
so it has to stash in the car.
I figure when Savino
gets in the car at the cut-rate...
I'll be going in back.
It'll be up under the rear seat.
And we probably can't be close enough
for an eyeball on this...
but the car will be a live wire.
And Kima will be throwing us
20s whenever she can. Rhonda.
I only want to remind Mr. Blocker here...
that his plea agreement
is contingent on cooperation.
And a buy-bust on Savino Bratton
is less cooperative...
than a buy-bust from someone
higher up on the food chain.
If you can get Savino
talking about Avon or Stringer...
that's better for us and better for you.
They already know that he got jacked
on a reverse buy, right?
-Why wouldn't they assume he's snitching?
-I need money for a lawyer, right?
That's the story.
He got popped and now he needs
to get right back into it...
to pay the bondsman and the lawyer.
All right. Let's make this work.
Careful. That's my career
you're holding there.
-You got a unit?
-Parked in the mezzanine.
-Give me the keys, man.
-No, I'm driving, motherfucker.
Come on, man.
Death row here.
Ain't up.
Death row.
My girl. Half the money's hers.
Baby, since we going down North Avenue...
stop by the carry-out
so I can pick me up some cigarettes.
They're going up North, stay loose.
Shit. It's too loud.
Does any unit have the eyeball?
Negative, 1 1-35.
Come on, Greggs, tell us
where the fuck you are.
Pull in there.
-What?
-Pull in there.
Don't fuck with this count.
I'll be right back with your shit.
Where are we?
That sign said Longwood,
but I could swear this was Warwick.
Hoppers be turning the sign poles
to fuck with you all.
I make it we're on the north side of Warwick,
in an alley....
I don't know, shit.
Half a block west of Longwood, maybe?
I hope you all copy that.
Yeah, that puts us about eight blocks away.
I'm pushing in a little closer.
All units be advised.
Warwick near Longwood
in the north side alley. Or near that 20.
This got the right feel for you?
You creeping closer?
He better not be long,
because I don't know where the stash is...
and if they dragging us all over
this part of town--
-What's that?
-What?
Something ain't right.
-What?
-Shit ain't right.
You snitching motherfucker.
Signal 13, signal 13!
Gunshots...
Gunshots. Go city-wide. 11-35.
Signal 13. Warwick...
near Longwood, officer down.
Two males, black hoodie,
both of them, one is--
Signal 13, Warwick, near Longwood,
in the alleys. Check the alleys...
Northside, 2800 block. Nothing.
We got an officer down,
she's a number one, female undercover.
Unit 833, bearing east
on 3100 block of Baker. Clear.
2900 is dark.
11-35, 10-38 is responding.
10-4.
1 1-71, does anyone have a visual?
Does anyone have a visual?
-Foxtrot.
-What are we looking for?
1 1-35 to KGA.
We can't find the officer down.
We need Foxtrot...
Iooking for a green Lincoln Town Car with
a brown vinyl roof, parked in those alleys.
Iooking for a green Lincoln Town Car with
a brown vinyl roof, parked in those alleys.
Foxtrot en route, 3-1-4.
3-14, be advised, we have a signal 13.
7820, rear odd-side.
3300 block of Baker. Clear.
Visual, rear even-side
of Warwick and Longwood.
Signal 13, signal 13. Officer down.
SUV, west on Warwick, make the next right.
Be advised, no movement at scene.
In here. Call for a medic.
We got an officer down, we need a medic.
7820, 10-23, give us DV in here.
10-4.
Where the fuck is the medic?
Signal 13, we got an officer down.
10-38 is responding.
Do we have a description?
Any unit on scene?
Do you have a description of the suspect?
That's a 10-47.
How many shells you got?
Come on, come on!
Another bag here.
Christ.
Sergeant?
Yeah?
Who are the primaries?
Cole and Norris.
Cole's here...
and Norris is at the hospital.
What do you need?
Room to work.
I keep ordering people off the scene...
and between Narcotics,
DEA and the two districts...
we keep collecting more
and more bodies around here.
Nobody move!
I said, nobody fucking move!
If you haven't been assigned a specific task
by a homicide detective...
you need to step away
from this crime scene.
Is there anybody doesn't
understand a direct order?
If you have not specifically
been instructed otherwise...
then remove your useless
interfering asses from the area.
Now!
Slow this thing down to a crawl.
Give these bastards no chance
to fuck up in a meaningful way.
Okay.
Wedged all the way to the back.
She couldn't get to it.
She taped it up front...
but as soon as she put any weight
on these worn-ass car seats...
they pulled the tape off.
Gun slid back behind the mesh
as they drove, probably.
Christ.
Where was her support?
There were two follow cars
several blocks distant.
She got turned around in the alleys.
She gave her 20
as the north side of Warwick.
They went there on the shots?
The Foxtrot finally found her.
Hey, you got to be moving outta here.
So, we had two units
covering the north side...
and a helicopter up on top.
And no one saw any vehicles in flight.
Bunk.
Terry, Mike, come on.
What the fuck happened?
You didn't have an eyeball?
On those streets,
there's no way you can eyeball it.
-She threw out 20s as best she could.
-Understood, I'm just asking.
The link we have to this is Savino Bratton.
A minor lieutenant to our target, Barksdale.
I gave your people that at the scene.
We're hitting his last knowns.
The set-up was more than him.
The casings are different calibers,
and her Glock was full up.
-How bad?
-Chest wound, no exit.
Through and through to the throat.
She wasn't stabilized.
They had the pressure pants on her.
Trying to push up the pulse.
They put those pants on you, it ain't good.
You're on Baker when you hear the shots.
Where was the second car?
-Warwick, I think.
-Okay.
You've got the east well-covered...
-to the west is the rail bed.
-What did Foxtrot see?
Nothing moving except our units.
Lieutenant...
I know just how you feel.
This is the toughest job
a police commissioner has.
I don't think I'll ever get used to it.
This is Lieutenant Daniels.
Right, of course.
This entire department
stands behind Detective Greggs...
in every possible way.
I just thought you should know that.
Yes, sir.
Jaybird.
We have a runner.
Yeah, we're gonna need casts
of these two imprints.
Put the lab tech on it.
1 1-39.
The money's not anyone's primary concern.
I understand that.
I'm not going to be standing...
giving a shit about the money
when you have lost...
one of your own who might....
I mean, Jesus, this is awful.
-If we can get to this Savino character--
-Hey.
Fuck your money.
Jimmy?
You hurt?
No.
It's hers.
Come on, get up.
Let's go, up with you.
Come on.
Couldn't talk, couldn't breathe.
Nothing.
She went into the ambo that way.
Is she....
What the fuck did I do?
Come on, walk.
What's that?
What's our plan, Ray?
Bunk and Jay stay with the scene.
Keeley and Crutchfield are at the office
typing warrants for Savino.
-Who's on the autopsy?
-Me, I'm at the morgue.
Norris and Holley stay at shock trauma
in case she sits up and talks.
We're laser printing the car, right?
'Course, Worden's on that.
You're in command for the city, right?
Major Rawls, Homicide.
Anything you need from my office...
men, money, whatever, you just ask.
Right.
Cooperator, your girl's down
in shock trauma.
Let's get to work.
Fuck you.
Fuck me?
We got a wire up.
So?
So we got a wire up on some motherfucker
that just shot a cop.
If somebody talks,
and gets on the wrong phone...
says the wrong thing
about what happened...
where the fuck do you want to be?
Church roof?
Yeah, you and me.
Sydnor takes the McCullough Street phone.
Anybody get in contact with Kima's people?
Shit.
I'll do that first,
then meet you at the church.
Bunk, Mike.
Wonder who that bitch was.
-Always some shit, right?
-Yeah.
-Done?
-Done.
All right.
Let's get outta here.
Yeah.
Lab tech to this spot.
Photos and casts.
1-39.
11-35.
Can I get 18-1 2 up here?
Yeah.
You're camped here.
Nobody touches this shit,
or even comes near it...
until the tech does his recovery.
Hello.
He stopped running.
Either he got tired or--
Or he got into a car.
Right.
-1 1-34.
-Go ahead, 11-34.
I'm in the...
3000 block of Landvale.
Backing up to the CSX bed.
I need a lab unit,
and a DPW crew with a jackhammer.
A jackhammer?
Gonna keep a bit of road, KGA.
Alive. In the OR.
My people at the scene have heard this.
-It's a copy of the original.
-Okay.
We brought a machine--
-Where the fuck is--
-Sir.
Here it is, here.
Yeah, put it there.
Don't fuck with this count.
Don't fuck with this count.
That's Savino.
I'll be right back with your shit.
Where are we?
That sign said Longwood,
but I could swear this is Warwick.
Hoppers be turning the sign poles
to fuck with you all.
I make it we're on the north side of Warwick,
in an alley, I don't know, shit...
half a block west of Longwood, maybe?
I hope you all copy that.
This got the right feel for you?
He better not be long,
'cause I don't know where the stash is...
and if they dragging us all over
this part of town--
What's that?
Jesus.
-Something ain't right.
-What?
This shit ain't right.
Christ.
Signal 13, signal 13.
What the fuck?
She can't reach the gun.
-What the fuck?
-Two males, black hoodies, both of them--
Shut it off.
Shut it off.
Dr. Mells, Line 6.
Listen to me, you fuck.
You did a lot of shit here.
You played a lot of fucking cards
and made a lot of people...
do a lot of fucking things
they didn't want to do.
This is true.
We both know this is true.
Dr. Ralston, please call cardiology.
You, McNulty, are a gaping asshole.
We both know this.
Fuck if everybody in CID doesn't know it.
But fuck if I'm gonna stand here...
and say you did a single fucking thing
to get a police shot.
You did not do this, you fucking hear me?
This is not on you.
No, it isn't, asshole.
Believe it or not, everything isn't about you.
And the motherfucker saying this...
he hates your guts, McNulty.
So you know if it was on you...
I'd be the son of a bitch to say so.
Shit went bad.
She took two for the company.
That's the only lesson here.
Police!
Police, let me see your hands.
-Get on the ground!
-Down on the ground!
Search warrant, get on the ground.
Police, get down.
Let's see your hands.
-He ain't here!
-Who ain't here?
-Zach, he ain't here!
-Zach?
No, honey, we're looking for Savino.
Savino?
No, he's my baby.
Yeah, your baby shot a cop.
They're kicking in the doors,
looking for Savino.
-What? What up with that, man?
-Some shit about he killed a cop.
Who, Savino?
Savino ain't shot no cop.
They kicking in the doors,
acting like he did it.
-Shit.
-I'm telling you, man.
They're talking about it anyway.
Ripples in the pond.
Talking ain't knowing, is it?
Skin this cat another way.
Two pages to Stringer tonight, right?
Only this one after the shooting.
Who's 07?
And what phone is he asking
for Stringer to call him back?
-Shit went good, but--
-Hold on.
Officer was shot around 12.:30 this morning.
The officer may have been undercover.
-All right, talk.
-Like I said, it went good...
except there was this bitch
curled up in the back seat.
Surprised the shit out of us.
Didn't even see her
until the shit popped off.
I mean if it was up to me,
I'd have let the girl walk.
She didn't look like the talking type.
But Little Man seen her,
bugged out, and let a couple go.
-Savino didn't tip y'all off to her?
-Wasn't no time for that.
He get up out the car,
we see him go up the block...
Iike we said, right?
After that, he out of sight
and we bring it home like we planned, baby.
Shorty was a cop.
And she ain't dead.
Where'd you all put the guns?
She wasn't no cop, man.
She look like one of Orlando's hos.
Bey, where the fuck are the guns?
-A storm drain off of Park Heights, man.
-What the fuck is wrong with Little Man?
I mean, this motherfucker
bugged out one time.
He gonna bug out again,
when he find out shorty's a fucking cop?
I mean, come on, man.
Savino got a story that
he can keep to and he know it...
but Little Man, he always
been fucking weak like that.
Little Man gotta go.
You hear me?
This shit gonna get real heavy.
You understand me?
We gotta fall back.
I wanna see how it go
with this Savino bullshit...
see how they go past that.
But if the shit don't hold...
or if this motherfucking cop
wake up and start talking shit...
then you gotta go sky up.
Where you got your peoples at?
New York.
Jersey, Cleveland.
All right. So, Philly.
DC.
You know what I'm saying?
No profile, no connections, no noise.
You feel me, right?
All right. We gotta be careful.
Jesus.
Look, I'm sorry.
It's all right, you just scared me.
I work with Kima.
Kima, she....
Kima's at work.
What is she?
Dust the receiver, the coin return,
and the metal top.
The can, too.
Dr. Jones to the nurses' station, please.
We can't really know for sure.
Lieutenant.
I'm sitting over there with Kima's girl and--
Maybe somebody
from the department or the city...
maybe might want to say something.
Who's here from the family?
A daughter, you say?
A daughter?
Officer Greggs has a girl?
A roommate.
The family's in Richmond,
driving up first thing today...
but the roommate's already here.
I'll do it myself.
No problem.
If we lose her,
he can always pose for the funeral.
Still need the right door for Savino.
His last knowns, his girlfriend, his mama,
all empty holes.
Tracers picked up a of couple hairs
on one of the hoodies.
That's something.
So, either these guys
are neighborhood yos...
who lucked into $30,000
on a street stickup, or....
Or they're pros who set up in an alley
on one side of the tracks...
then slip over to the other side...
where they park their ride.
What about the post?
Cause and manner of death
on Mr. Blocker is homicide...
to wit, close-range GSWs to the shoulder,
chest and left arm.
Nine millimeter, six left twist,
suitable for comparison.
We pulled something else
from the back seat of the car, right?
Yeah, .380. Semi-jacketed.
Casings were different, too.
So, we confirmed the two shooters.
Print hit.
Wynton "Little Man" Rice,
enforcer in the 221 ...
a definite connect to Barksdale's world.
Print hit?
Print hit from what?
Soda can.
Dropped at the pay phone
at Park Heights and Belvedere.
Still had a little fizz in it when I got there.
What is this pay phone
at Park Heights and Belvedere?
It's from which some
motherfucker paged Stringer Bell...
20 minutes after the shooting.
I dusted the phone, too,
but it was smudged.
So we got a Barksdale pro
in the northwest...
ringing up the boss minutes after the deed.
So much for the amateur-hour theory.
Good pull. You are?
Freamon. Lester Freamon.
Where you working?
Pawn shop unit.
I mean, how you gonna shoot a police?
Ain't no percentage in that,
know what I'm saying?
For real.
Someone around here do that shit...
every narco in the world
be down here busting heads.
I guess them Park Heights niggers
just ain't got no fucking common sense.
A lotta heart, just no sense.
Poot.
Wallace on the phone.
-Yeah?
-Wallace?
Nigger ring me up twice a day
whether he got shit to say or not.
-Homesick motherfucker making me bug.
-Where's he at?
At the shore with his grandma,
down there....
Surfing or some bullshit.
Or something.
Dr. Zellesky, you have a call on Line 5.
You just use that phone?
Yeah, a little earlier.
-You might wanna go to Mosher Street.
-Just now, you used it?
Yeah.
-A man downtown needs to talk to you.
-Man downtown?
Make some sense for this man, please.
All right?
-I ain't never been so clean in my life.
-I'm just doing my job.
Okay.
What up, Mr. Beachfront Property?
No, fool, I told you, I'm bayside.
My grandmother on the bayside.
Still, man, you on vacation
and not bringing me with you.
How you get all the way down there?
I took a bus.
Shit, tell me how to go,
and I grab a 'hound, too.
Come down there and hang with your ass.
No, man, it ain't like that.
The air down here all sticky.
Worse than Baltimore.
And these crickets,
louder than a motherfucker.
I can't get no sleep.
I don't think I'm cut out
to be no country-ass nigger, man.
Please deposit two dollars
for an additional two minutes.
Shit, I gotta go.
You can take a nigger out the Westside.
But you can't take--
What's your name?
Look, I didn't do shit here, okay?
I asked you your name.
No, this shit ain't right.
Who'd you try to page, shit bird?
Why the fuck do you care, okay?
I mean....
You have exactly three more seconds
to explain yourself to me, asshole.
One shooter definitely
opened the passenger door...
so any latent prints
from that side of the car....
-Why'd you page her, shit bird?
-Get off me.
You think this is a fucking game?
I wanna talk to Detective Greggs.
-You can't, motherfucker.
-Then McNulty then. This shit ain't right, sir.
Savino.
Mope ain't around.
One of them low-rise hoppers...
on Tower Phone 2.
Okay.
Maybe he forgot the number.
The fuck was that?
You don't know?
We just caught a re-up off the tower stash.
Fourth floor, south side, second unit down.
Put that away.
Put that away and work the case.
Can I ask you something?
How much of this case would you
give up to get her back?
That's not the point.
How much?
All of it.
But it doesn't work that way.
You can't give it back.
I'm sitting with a hospital progress report
that shows no fucking progress.
She's not conscious, she's intubated.
She's had a trach and a lung collapse...
and if she's got a shred of luck...
the shot she took to the neck
didn't catch any spine.
It wasn't worth it.
Homicide for McNulty on Line 2.
Do your job.
Yeah?
So how you doing with it?
I'll live.
Yeah?
Listen, Jimmy.
We had a little dust-up over here.
Holley might have beat
one of your girl's Cls on spec.
What is he, a short guy?
Mumbles a lot?
Yeah, that's him.
You might wanna roll past
and squelch this shit...
before it gets outta hand.
Yeah.
It ain't worth it, man.
It ain't worth it at 10 times the price.
A fucking cop, man. A cop!
How stupid is this motherfucker?
lf you see a bitch in the car, change it up.
We can go to Orlando another fucking day.
Savino say he was trying to signal,
but he in the dark...
he don't know where Bey's coming from.
Nothing breaking our way.
We gotta burn this shit.
This is cop money.
It's probably marked somehow.
The guns are in the sewer,
Bey's a rock, so that's cool.
But it's the bitch cop.
If she starts talking,
she gonna put Little Man and Bey in there.
What up with Little Man?
-He's scared. He shot a cop.
-Fuck.
But I put Bey on that.
What about Savino?
Savino, he gotta eat the charge.
But he knew that.
So if he keep his story tight,
he gonna be all right.
We knew Orlando was
a snitching motherfucker, man.
Fuck him, but this is cash.
He got us caught up.
I know, man. That's my fault, man.
Bey and Savino came to me
with the idea that...
if they take Orlando,
they can take the cash, too.
I was like, all right, you all get your payday--
How the fuck is Orlando
gonna front this type of cash?
What it say?
I know.
I know, I fucked up.
All right, take this trash outside,
fucking burn it.
Tell Wee-Bey to clean up the mess
before he jet.
He was throwing
91 1 messages to her pager.
I asked him why.
He raised up.
Shit got outta hand.
Does he know?
McNulty, man.
What they doing over there, man?
He just started beating on me.
Last night, she got shot.
Where the fuck were you at?
-Where were you?
-I was there.
Bunk.
Holley is investigating.
We got no good latents
on the passenger side door.
...and he sees her pager coming up 91 1 .
What about the dash?
You gotta help me!
Call the lab.
What can I do?
For one thing you can roll around
the projects and see who's missing.
Who ain't around.
You okay with that?
Yeah, I just....
I been keeping it kinda close, you know?
Ain't been around the projects much lately.
You know what I'm saying?
You beefing with someone down there?
No, I'm not beefing with....
Eyes open, Bubbs.
For Kima.
Hang loose, I'll get you a ride.
Where are we with Savino?
-Still MIA.
-Enough of this bullshit.
If he calls me for anything,
I'll tell him to turn himself in.
-I'm going to do that.
-Not good enough.
Excuse me?
We need him now.
No, thanks.
Perhaps as an officer of the court...
Ronnie here is being polite.
She's a member of your twisted little tribe.
She's putting it into
your twisted little language. Me?
I wouldn't wipe my ass
with a Baltimore lawyer.
No offense.
None taken.
I mean, I'm willing
to let you little ratfuckers suborn perjury...
blow smoke up a judge's ass
and jury-tamper your balls off...
without losing the slightest bit
of my sunny disposition.
Fuck me if I don't let you structure
your cash into briefcase fees, either.
That's between you and the IRS.
Neither one of you is anyone's friend, right?
What Jimmy is trying to say is--
No, what Jimmy is saying is if you want
my nose closed to your shit...
you have to throw me something
when I need it.
And right now I need Savino Bratton
in bracelets.
I don't know where he is.
You repped him the last four felonies.
I guess you can get word to him
if you want to.
A police may die, Morrie,
and Savino was there.
He comes in this afternoon...
and he takes the drug charge at least.
Or what?
Or we send tactical teams
into his momma's house every night...
until there's no house left to worry about.
You get a target letter
from the state's attorney's office...
followed by subpoenas
for every bank account...
in your fucking name.
And let's see if all those cash deposits
match the reported income.
I'm hearing this from him...
and I understand that he's distraught.
I understand that.
Am I hearing this from
the state's attorney's office as well?
You are.
I'll see what I can do.
Fuck you, Jimmy!
-You didn't tell me that was coming.
-He'll bring him in.
-He will if he can, that's not the point.
-What's the point?
The point is that Morrie Levy is a past
officer of the Monumental Bar Association...
and unless I want
to spend my whole life as a fucking ASA...
I can't spend my afternoons
pissing on people who matter.
Another career in the balance.
-Fuck you.
-No, fuck you.
If only half of you
in the state's attorney's office...
didn't want to be judges...
didn't want to be partners
in a downtown law firm...
if you had the balls to follow through,
you know what would happen?
A guy like that would be indicted,
tried and convicted.
The rest of them would back up...
so we could push a clean case
through your courthouse.
But no, everybody stays friends.
Everybody gets paid.
And everybody's got a fucking future.
You'll just use anyone, won't you?
I've been searching the logs for pager hits
that used an 07 code, right?
It comes up now and then
on D'Angelo's pager.
Stringer's, too, but less often.
Most of the time,
there's nothing to place the guy...
but check it.
-And this is on Stringer's page?
-It comes back to the pay phone...
in the emergency room
at Maryland General Hospital.
Let me guess.
The date of this page
is the same day that Stinkum got killed.
And Wee-Bey got shot in the leg.
That was the talk on the wire, anyway.
If you go to Maryland General
and pull the ER records for that morning...
you're gonna find Wee-Bey in the pile.
07 is Wee-Bey.
It's gotta be.
And we have Wee-Bey and Little Man
at the pay phone at Park Heights...
20 minutes after the ambush...
throwing a page to Stringer.
We're all over town
for this piece-of-shit Savino.
With ties to the Barksdale organization?
-Yes, sir.
-What else?
The case is progressing.
We're gleaning
possible shooters from the wiretap.
I asked for the controlled buy.
I put one of our people in harm's way.
So right now I want to make sure
that we are doing everything.
-We are, sir, we're on it.
-Good.
The commissioner wants raids citywide.
Every door we can take.
Any addresses we can write on,
anything connected to a narcotics case.
CID, tactical, the DEUs...
and tomorrow, on the 6:00 news...
we put a lot of fucking dope on the table.
A lot of it.
Dope on the table?
We need to let them know who we are.
We can't for one minute let them
think that this will stand.
The Commissioner wants
to send a message, Lieutenant.
You make sure you and your people...
do everything possible
to see that it is heard.
Dope on the damn table.
It's like the man said.
We're letting them know who we are.
Yeah?
And who the hell are we?
Again, for the record, let's make clear
that Mr. Bratton has not been Mirandized...
and that what is said here
is for purposes of a proffer.
-Agreed?
-Agreed.
Okay, then.
Here you go.
That's baking soda.
Which Mr. Bratton intended
to sell to Orlando Blocker.
You can keep it with our compliments.
Where's the money?
Mr. Bratton did not receive money.
He left it in the car
when he went to retrieve the sham cocaine.
If you were recording the transaction,
the tape will confirm this.
And he wasn't around
for the shooting either.
He doesn't know who the shooters are.
And God knows he wasn't in on the setup.
I mean, it was pure dumb luck...
that he left them in an dead-end alley
and they were shot...
just two minutes later.
This is bullshit.
A police is down.
Mr. Bratton had no knowledge
that the young woman was a police officer.
And no intention of doing anything other
than defrauding Mr. Blocker of $30,000.
Ms. Nathan?
No charge if he gives us the shooters.
And if he testifies...
we'll find a way to squeeze him
into the federal witness program.
As I indicated...
Mr. Bratton has no idea
who shot Mr. Blocker...
or the undercover officer.
Best you can do is 286B.
What the hell is that?
Distribution of sham CDS.
Three-year maximum, $5,000 fine.
That's it?
If he took the cash,
we could go to felony theft or fraud...
but the tape has him leaving the money.
Three years.
A cop was shot, Morrie.
So if we convict,
he'll do every damn day of the three.
I can do the three. Ain't no thing.
And the $5,000 fine?
Shit, you still up $25,000, right?
Nicely done.
Give me two.
Damn, Orlando.
I still can't believe that shit.
Man, all this shit behind this motherfucker.
Who the fuck was he?
-He ran a club for my uncle.
-Yeah?
Yeah, first Stink, and now him.
Yeah, man, and I heard the cops
been all in Savino's shit, too.
-He ain't been around.
-Little Man, neither.
Somebody could get
to cleaning up shit around here.
True.
You can't just be going around,
dropping 5-0 like that.
You know how your uncle is when
people get to fucking up, man.
He starts taking that shit personal, man.
Look like a couple more niggers
gonna get dropped.
What up?
You Dee?
Yeah.
They say you need to get with Stringer,
right away.
See?
You moving up in the world.
As long as you don't fall in
with the trash they taking out.
Yeah, whatever, nigger.
I'll be right back.
Tower boys all nervous and shit.
Little Man ain't post for work.
Ain't answering his page, neither.
See?
I'm not gonna lie.
She has swelling around the vertebrae...
and some indications of partial paralysis.
That may or may not go away
when the swelling goes down.
Her family is with her.
What the fuck is up with Homicide?
Are we on the shooters yet?
They're working it hard.
The departmental response is gonna be
to take doors tomorrow morning.
Citywide.
Every unit, every district is kicking in...
any drug-connected address
they can write on.
We're gonna do the same.
-Lieutenant, is that--
-Except...
we're gonna hold back on the main stash.
The house up in northwest
we tracked off the wire....
We advance this case more
by sitting on that location.
And raids that are too much
on the bulls-eye...
will have Barksdale changing up.
We might blow the wire altogether.
We got two addresses in the low-rises
that are probables...
and another two row houses...
that have been used for stash
as recently as last week.
But this....
this here is the best bet for a good rip.
Herc picked up on it yesterday.
Fourth-floor...
end unit on the south side of the 221 .
They're dropping the re-ups
out the window...
to the hoppers who run it off.
What if they change up the apartment?
They do that every day.
Yesterday was the fifth floor
on the north side.
We'll have a man on the church
with a cell phone.
They change up, we call the duty judge
who orally amends the warrant.
We hit everything at 1 1 :00.
The squad that takes the high-rise
needs to stage at 5:00.
We need to be inside before
the building even wakes up.
Anyone who wants to sleep tonight
needs to start typing his ass off right now.
What's up?
Why ain't the club open?
You going with Bey.
Bey.
Keep it clean.
Don't make no mistakes.
Going where?
What the fuck you waiting for?
Stop bullshitting me.
The main stash.
He knows we're on it.
He knows we held it back.
The Deputy.
We grab a senator's bag man
in the projects, he knows that.
State Police bring in a cooperator,
he knows it, too.
Like fucking clockwork.
He's got a rat.
Here, in the detail.
In the beginning...
when we started, Burrell had me.
I pipelined everything to that motherfucker.
But now he lost you.
So now he's picked up someone else.
That's how they do.
Can we talk?
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.
It's Burrell, he's gotta back off already.
What now?
We're on a prime location.
Barksdale's stash.
Instead of making cases, he wants us
to write a paper and take the door.
-Why?
-Dope on the table.
It's a photo op to make us feel better
about Kima Greggs catching a bullet or two.
Christ.
You need to rip him a new one, Your Honor.
I don't know, Jimmy.
You back on the ticket, huh?
It was just the usual bullshit.
They're just dicking me around...
trying to get another black face,
make it four-and-one...
to even up for the last time.
The Governor had to promise
two new appointments.
So now we're back where we were.
That's all it was.
That's all?
Half-assed hack politics, Jimmy.
It has nothing to do with your case.
I need you on this.
So, who's my daddy now?
I just do what the fuck
they tell me, you know?
It ain't on me to know
what the fuck they have in mind.
Look, Bey.
Now it come down to this crazy shit.
Turn in this alley right here. Right there.
What the fuck you stopping for? Go!
Inside, man. Let's go.
This dude is crazy.
Get in, motherfucker.
We ain't got all night for this shit.
Man, get in here.
Go ahead, man.
What's wrong with you?
Check it out, Dee.
I need you to feed them while I'm gone.
You gonna give them different food
for each tank, too, all right?
But don't worry.
I'm gonna show you what to do. Come here.
These are my Tetras.
You got Kimmy, Alex, Aubrey
and Jezebel in here somewhere.
I don't know, she think she cute.
You take two pinches of whatever food
I got next to each tank.
They set for the day.
You see, they ain't no problems.
Just beautiful as hell, Dee.
I'm gonna go upstairs, and pack some shit.
Bey.
Where we going, man?
Philly. You gonna take the truck back...
but first I got to go upstairs, grab some shit,
show you what to do with my tanks, right?
Philly?
We shot a narco, Dee.
No Savino.
No Little Man, no Wee-Bey, either.
And the Barksdale kid from the Pit...
he's out the mix, too.
You think it was them that did it?
Wee-Bey, Savino, Little Man.
Yeah, that's what we're hearing, too.
We got pick-ups on these motherfuckers...
and miles of NCIC bullshit.
Warrants for blood and hair, too.
It's Bey and Little Man,
shooter one and two.
I feel it, Bunk.
Yeah?
Right now, we need our girl to wake up...
and say so.
All right.
You did good, Bubbs.
McNulty, you know...
the situation is different for me.
-I mean, for me, I'm--
-Mount up.
I gotta go.
Prez will get you a ride, okay?
Move out.
Police.
Police! Go!
Show your hands, asshole!
Down on the ground. Move it, move it!
McNulty, Freamon, check the basement.
-Clear?
-All clear.
-Bathroom's clear.
-Check the mattress.
Check under the bed, check all the drawers,
check every fucking inch of this room.
-Got anything?
-No.
Bingo.
Got it. There she goes.
Bag it.
Let's do it.
That's fine police work, Erv.
Ladies and gentlemen...
what you see on the table in front ofyou...
represents our department's answer
to a culture of death and drugs.
And when an officer falls in this war...
others stand ready
to pick up the challenge...
and carry the fight
to the very doorstep of those responsible.
This is only the beginning,
I can assure you.
But today, a message has been sent.
And believe me, this message
is being heard loud and clear...
by all those who seek profit and power...
in the importation and sale of illegal drugs.
Slow.
Bullshit on the McCullough Street phone,
nothing on the towers.
Who's on the rooftop?
No one.
Fuck it.
Where's the money, man?
-How much you need?
-The bus cost like $18, man.
Your grandma ain't got it?
If I ask her, she gonna try
to stop me from booking.
I'm telling you, boy.
This country-ass shit got me all messed up.
I'm saying, you need to send me
something for the bus.
Yeah, I feel you.
-When do you want to come home?
-When the money get here.
All right, I'm gonna probably send it today.
How is she?
In and out of the morphine drip.
They got her stabilized is all I know.
Go on in.
No.
Unfreeze your ass off that wall, then.
Either pay your respects,
or get your head back into this case.
-Fuck this case.
-Fuck it?
Now you're just gonna, what,
call off your little crusade?
Is that what you think it was? A crusade?
Avon Barksdale was a way
to show everyone how smart I was...
and how fucked up
the department is, that's all.
Just put Jimmy McNulty
up on your shoulders...
march him around the room,
break out the keg.
It was never about
Avon Barksdale, Lieutenant.
It was all about me.
You think I didn't know that?
You think we all didn't know?
Listen, this case is gonna move forward...
with you or without you.
This case got her shot.
I put a battery up her ass...
and got her thinking
this case meant something.
And you know what?
Burrell, Rawls, and them, they were right.
This case means exactly shit.
I know it meant damn near nothing to me
when you came in beating the drum.
But now we got that woman
in there, that good police...
breathing through a fucking tube,
because it meant something to her.
And the shooters who dropped Kima?
They're still in the wind.
And whoever sent those motherfuckers
into that alley...
he needs to get got, too.
So you can stand there,
dripping with liquor-smell and self-pity...
if you got a mind to, but this case...
it means something. Now.
You hit them again?
I been calling them all morning.
They ain't hit me back yet.
Damn, we gonna tap out by noon.
Poot! What we got over there?
200, maybe.
What the fuck is this?
What the fuck you think, nigger? Fish food.
Give me my shit.
Heads up.
String.
I need your pagers.
All of y'all, the whole crew.
-Who else?
-Sterling, Cass and Manny.
-All right, go get them shits.
-How am I gonna talk to my girl?
Talk to your hand, nigger,
that's the only girl you got.
No more.... Get out of here.
Just get the fuck out of here, man.
No more pagers.
Touts, lookouts, off the air, all right?
Nobody gonna use these cell phones
except for you and Bodie...
and y'all don't say shit on these,
you understand me?
We got the numbers
and we the only niggers that need them.
Not your moms, not your girl, nobody.
You feel me?
You use these phones to set up a meet,
go to that meet...
and talk face to face, period.
-So no more pay phones?
-You deaf? I said no phones.
How I'm gonna reach y'all?
All right, top number's for re-ups...
second number's for muscle.
You need me, hit me on the third number.
Learn them shits, then throw that shit away.
-You doing this in the towers, too?
-Doing it everywhere.
Pagers, pay phones is dead.
-All right?
-Yeah.
String.
We need some re-up, man,
we gonna tap out by noon.
Re-up from where? You niggers ain't heard?
Knockos took the main stash.
Why the fuck you think we changing up?
Back the fuck up, young'un.
These shits ain't for you.
All right.
Cool. There you go.
There we go. All right.
The gift of corrected vision.
Compliments of the BPD.
-Dang, y'all are focused.
-What man wouldn't be?
They been cleaning us for the past few days.
-Last night they burned us all the way.
-I knew it.
I fucking knew it.
I swear to God,
I'm in this motherfucker's head.
Not a message since early morning.
Shit, I even had to cut Prez loose.
-Send his ass on down to Annapolis.
-For what?
State campaign finance reports.
I checked all the stuff here.
But I got the feeling
Barksdale's money has legs.
Shit.
All the work we did
to get up on this fucking wire.
You don't hit these guys
and expect them to stay in the pocket.
-Plus, they know they dropped a police.
-Then we need to change up, too.
Come on.
Shardene!
Honey, this is Detective McNulty,
who's working with us.
She works at Orlando's,
helping us out there from time to time.
And now I think
that she can see well enough...
to match faces to voices.
Lester, look, I'm not gonna lie to you.
I'm scared of this shit.
Time comes, though,
I know you gonna step up.
We're gonna need Pearlman
to approve her wearing a wire.
-Can I get a cup of coffee?
-What do you take in it?
I'll get it. A little cream, right?
Those knockos motherfuckers
cleaned my shit out.
-You can replace product and currency.
-Yeah, he right.
-We gotta focus on what's real, here.
-All of this shit is real.
They wanna put me in a box.
Listen, I think what's important
is to take stock.
Ask yourself what's out there
that can still hurt you.
Where are you weak?
Where you need to clean up?
Think it through.
Start with Orlando, if Orlando rolled.
You know he talked about the club, at least.
That punk-ass nigger
ain't talk about shit else but the club.
That's all he knew about.
He wasn't rolling with us.
We kept him on the outside.
So you walk away from the club.
You're not on the license,
you're not a listed owner.
They can't make a connect.
When did this shit start up?
About the time that
your nephew beat that charge.
After, maybe when they found that witness
with the lead in his dome...
the shit hit the newspapers.
But around that time,
the cops was on our shit.
The security guard,
the one whose testimony sprung D'Angelo--
-Nakeisha Lyles?
-Yeah.
Bug-eyed ass bitch. But we hooked that up.
-So she can still hurt you, right?
-Yeah.
The point is anybody
who can hurt you can be put into play.
-The less I hear, the better.
-All right, yo.
Hey, yo, lock that door?
So we got Bird and Bey.
-Bird will stand tall.
-He already in jail, and Bey about to go, too.
And Wee-Bey hard like a rock.
And we got Savino.
Savino know it ain't nothing
but an Arm and Hammer charge.
I mean, he ain't gonna flip out
over a motherfucking three years.
True.
Then we got that shit with Orlando,
and the only problem there was Little Man.
Was.
Who else?
It's over, your wire's cold.
The court orders give me
a total of 90 days on five phones.
I'm doing the full 90.
You want to sit listening to a bunch
of broke-ass pay phones, have at it.
But you don't need
all that manpower to do it.
You want some bodies back,
I'll send a couple, no problem.
Hold on, Lieutenant.
I gave you those people.
I decide who comes back.
But feel free to speak your mind,
if it were up to you.
He asked you a question, Lieutenant.
I have no opinion. Take your pick.
What's the name of that
old detective from Pawnshop?
And that young one,
Valchek's brain-dead son-in-law.
Freamon, Pryzbylewski.
Keep them.
Send back Sydnor and Santangelo.
And, Lieutenant, if you want
to do anything beyond...
Iisten to those dead phones...
you need to brief me first.
You did good, Cedric.
You play your cards right, all the work
you did over the past few months...
will speak volumes for you.
And Maj. Spurgeon is saying
that he's retiring at the end of November.
Which opens up the Northwest Command.
That's right.
Hi, Ronnie. Come in. Sit.
-Sheila, send Patrick in.
-Yes, sir.
-Anything up?
-With me?
Same shit, different file.
-How about the Barksdale thing?
-You've got my office reports?
Wire's dead, but we're looking into a bug
in the man's nightclub.
Aside from that, you're doing what?
Pulling campaign finance reports
for every politician...
in the city of Baltimore, right?
I am?
We are?
And making calls to some contributors...
asking questions,
doing background checks.
I don't know anything about this.
I mean, Ronnie,
where the fuck is all this going?
Those are public reports, right? I mean....
No one on that detail
has come to me for any kind of subpoena.
You got back-doored, too?
Just so there's no misunderstanding...
I want to give you this.
Copies of checks on the account
of my re-election committee...
representing the return
of five separate contributions...
totaling $4,500.
Also copies of the checks...
from the donor are represented in there, too.
Kind of like Caesar's wife and all that shit.
The only thing that we could come up with
were those five checks.
And I don't know those people,
and I don't know why they gave.
That money's gonna be returned
to the donors immediately.
Guys, listen to me.
I don't know a fucking thing...
about anyone looking
at campaign contributions.
Be that as it may...
this should make it clear
that our hands are clean.
Ronnie, I want you to take that back
to whoever's on the hunt...
and I want you to tell them
they've got no quarrel with me.
What's up, String?
So y'all want to get with me?
Yeah, we need to holler at your boy...
you know, the one
that dimed on Omar's bitch.
Can't recall his name.
Which one?
The one that was at the Greek's that night.
-And we paid him for the lookout.
-What y'all need him for?
What's it to you?
-You ain't got to worry about him.
-Say what?
He's gone, he's out the game.
Out the game?
Yo, the man asked you a simple question.
I don't mean y'all no disrespect.
You know I don't.
I am sitting here telling you
that the boy is out the game.
And even if he wasn't out the game,
he wouldn't be no problem.
But you know we just want
to talk to him, Dee.
Let the boy be.
Just let him be.
Honey, just leave the damn thing alone.
-Where'd you get these, man?
-Prevas.
Broadway market?
-Best chili dogs in the city.
-No, man, not even.
I'll give you $10
if you can name a better dog.
-George's Lunch on Light Street.
-The Greek joint?
That place closed back when you were
still sucking on your mama's nipples.
My mama's nipples?
I was sucking on them plums last night.
You owe me $10.
I said, name a better dog
you can have today, not in world history.
-You just said a better dog.
-You go get that dog right now.
-You cannot go get that now.
-And you tell me...
-the best fucking dog.
-Physically--
Can you please keep it down?
I can't hear a goddamn thing!
You'd know how much I got...
if you laid something on me.
-You like that freeze?
-If you holding.
I'm fixing to be.
That's why I'm here, you know?
To discuss some things.
When you done discussing, you come back.
All right, then.
Hold that pose right there, shorty.
I'm gonna hook you up with some uncut.
Y'all niggers talk too damn much, man.
Who the fuck is she? Housing police?
No, she's one of them civilians
they got doing security.
-Housing cops wear the gray uniforms.
-So she's not armed or nothing.
Do she look it?
You leaving early?
I was early, I worked the lunch crowd.
She's out.
-Anything?
-Table scraps.
What we want is being said in that office.
There's no reason for Shardene
to be in there long enough for us to get it.
-Take it out, I can't do this anymore.
-You won't have to, darling.
I think they'll look at me and know.
I need to quit.
I don't need you wearing
this wire, all right, honey?
I just need you to go in there
and do one more thing.
Look at this country nigger.
-Damn, Wallace.
-Wally!
He kept crying till I sent him bus money.
All right. I just got tired
of that same old country scenery.
It was just too slow for me.
Yeah, but did you get
some of that country ass?
And if he did, it was on four legs.
Nigger, they got no farms down there, man,
but they did have some Bamas though.
They got their Saturday night
shit down at Sears.
-They was like, you know--
-Tears, right? You were about to cry.
That where you got them Die-Hards?
-Man, these Timbs.
-Yeah, they Timbs.
I can see the tree on the side of them.
So you gonna put me back on the money?
Hold. Look, if we do put you back on...
you have to start as lookout, man.
You lost your spot
when you bucked town, dawg.
Come on, a real man
would stay with his people...
he wouldn't run at the first sight
of some blood.
Y'all can still holler 5-0, right?
If he want back on the money,
he back on the money.
If he want it.
My man might be thinking of going
back to Edmondson...
Iike we talked about, right?
Come on, nigger, let's walk.
Dawg, you ain't cornholed
no animal for real, did you?
-Go ahead, Poot.
-You're stupid.
Don't be fucking with my Sean John.
-So who caught it?
-Garvey.
He knows about the whole witness angle...
but he doesn't want to run it up
to the bosses until he knows more.
Why ace Nakeisha Lyles now?
Because now they know we're for real.
Avon's cleaning house all the way.
First the phones go dead
and then anyone he thinks...
we might be able to flip.
What about the boy?
Fuck me.
We took him to the shore Friday
and the plan was to bring him back up...
-on the Monday for the grand jury.
-And what happened?
-Greggs got shot.
-Trooper Reese?
This is Lieutenant Daniels
with the Baltimore Department.
Is there someone that can
go near Cambridge...
check on a kid we got stashed down there?
-Call him.
-No, there's no phone there.
-Can you hang on?
-I'll hold, yeah.
Have Sydnor pull a car from motor pool.
We get the kid back up here tonight,
he sleeps on my sofa...
and we grand-jury him in the morning.
-What about your stripper?
-The woman's got heart.
I mean, I want her protected.
No more bodies, hear?
I got room at my place,
she can lay up with me.
-I got no problem with that.
-Remember who you are, Detective.
Protect and serve, Lieutenant.
I'm saying, this here game,
it ain't gonna work for you no more, man.
You leaving, you stirred up some shit.
-I'm saying it ain't your fault.
-Dee, look.
I appreciate what you trying to say and all,
but I grew up in the courts, all right?
I been with them niggers since forever.
This is home, right?
You ain't hearing me, Wallace.
Anybody asks you whether
you in this game...
you tell them you in it for life, all right?
You play it hard, you play it tight...
and make sure niggers know
you gonna stand by your people.
No loose talk, no second thoughts,
and no snitching.
Play it like that.
-What you doing down in the PJ's, you lost?
-I'm looking for you.
-You know I be down here working.
-A working man got to eat.
-My favorite spicy fish cakes?
-On the saltines with the mustard.
You gonna make me cry, you know.
I need to get up out of here
and get back to it.
-You be safe.
-You, too.
All right.
This here.
Sterling's, baby, we're about to feast.
What the hell is Sterling's?
Sterling's, up on 29th Street?
Don't you know nothing?
Shit, if it ain't up on the Westside,
I don't know shit.
'Cause this shit...
this is me, yo, right here.
Who was that, your new girl or something?
No, nigger, that's my mom.
You know Senator Davis?
No, sir.
Lieutenant.
Clay wanted to meet you,
see if there was any help he can offer.
Help?
Your people are apparently
pulling finance reports...
and checking up on some
of the contributors.
I wanted to reassure you on that front.
I'm not involved in drugs, Lieutenant.
Good.
And this business with the senator's driver.
Mr. Price, Damien.
Day-Day.
This business with Mr. Price,
this is a misunderstanding...
that is really of no concern to the police.
He had $20,000 of cash on him...
delivered out of a project tower
by a known drug suspect.
The money was banded
and manicured by denomination.
There's no crime here.
That was money that Damien
already had on him...
when he drove down to Franklin Terrace.
Money from a cash-bar fundraiser
the previous weekend.
We filed an amended
finance report that shows--
Fine.
There's no probable cause
for a search of Mr. Price.
I think we are in agreement on that.
No, there was PC for the search.
You're saying you have evidence
that a senatorial aide is involved in drugs?
I'm saying we had reason to stop Mr. Price...
and effect a body search,
after which we discovered...
$20,000 in cash in banded, manicured bills.
That's all I'm saying.
Will you explain to this motherfucker
just what it is he's doing here?
-Lt. Daniels--
-Excuse me, sir.
But it's pretty basic.
If the senator is not involved
in anything illegal...
then he doesn't need to worry.
I can't be any clearer about it than that.
Fool, what do you think?
That we know anything
about who gives money?
That we give a damn about
who they are or what they want?
We have no way of running down
them or their stories.
We don't care.
We just cash the damn checks,
count the votes, and move on.
Anything else, Deputy Burrell?
Gentlemen.
You need to put his ass on a foot post
so far out in the sticks...
that he's gonna see
the Philadelphia cops walking towards him.
Now you just ain't talking to me now, Erv.
You talking to the Mayor...
the city caucus, the state central committee.
And right now,
you got your hand in our pocket.
Eighteen, baby!
Eighteen with a bullet, baby.
Det. Sgt. Hauk reporting for duty, sir.
And the best part? Carver's 37.
You know, it helps
if you know them by the numbers.
It makes you sound more professional.
Fucking Carver...
he gets back from in-service training,
he's gonna kiss the stripes...
I'm gonna make him kiss the stripes.
-Congratulations.
-Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.
-Sgt. Hauk?
-God help us.
-Daniels.
-Daniels, this is Trooper Reese.
Grandmother says this kid's
been gone two days.
Wallace is out of pocket. Two days.
-Thanks.
-Yeah.
Ain't no re-up in the towers, neither?
Shop dead, yo.
-What up, man?
-Same old.
What's up with that boy?
He's just a punk, that's all.
Dee put him back on count though.
Word? I heard he was out the game.
He was, but he back now.
Where he been at?
Down his granny house, he says.
Right, his granny house.
I heard he damn near shit his pants...
when he saw what happened
to Omar's bitch.
He just ain't built for this, you know.
His heart pump Kool-Aid.
Right. What about you?
You built for this shit?
No doubt.
You ready to put the work in?
You got heat?
All right, soldier.
It's clear upstairs.
No extension cords. No juice boxes.
No Wallace.
Dang, boy, Chink Bob's...
never be putting no napkins in the bag.
Motherfucker, because
napkins expensive and shit.
So is my money.
All right, come on, go. Something to eat?
Y'all know what's here.
Let's go, y'all need
to get up in this Chinese food...
'cause, you know, I'm looking
kind of needy right about now.
What you listening to?
Hold up, take them plates first.
Big Tymers, their new video
on 106th and Park.
-106th and Park?
-The joint is vicious.
-Yeah.
-For real?
-What they call you?
-Buff, 'cause I got the stuff.
You got the stuff?
Buff, you need to get up
in these egg rolls or something.
Buff, you need to get up
in these egg rolls or something.
Any word on the kid?
I rolled around Cambridge
all night with his B of l.
If he's down there, he ain't got no profile.
We got lookouts to every car
in the Western and Central.
We're trying for an address on his mother.
-Detective.
-Lieutenant.
Wire's dead...
so we've been ordered
to begin sending bodies home.
Sydnor, we have a little longer,
because Cantrell still owes me.
-You okay with Rawls?
-I gave him his clearance, right?
What's he gonna do to me?
Keep it warm, Sanny.
What's that?
Plans for what is now Orlando's.
The upper floors.
This is the property next door.
-How'd you get them so quick?
-CoStar search.
Plan is to get a remote mike into the office.
Maybe even some fiber-optics.
Only we don't know
where Avon's office is yet.
Which is where Shardene
helps us out in a big way.
What she gonna do? Take out a tape
and ask Avon to hold the other end?
Ain't none of y'all ever been in the military?
How do you learn a 30-inch, quick-time?
Draft-dodging peace-freaks.
-Get me a ruler and some string.
-Why me?
Why?
-Because the man said so, that's why.
-Wallace ain't no snitch.
Man, how you know?
How you know where he been running to?
He was getting high. I've seen him cop.
He probably went down to the shore
to clean that shit up.
Man, if he using,
then you know he ain't reliable.
Come on, think.
Look, the man gave the word, all right?
We either step up or we step the fuck off.
That's the game.
That's the fucking game.
Cedric.
You ever hear of an elected official
in Baltimore giving money back?
Whatever you're doing
scared my boss shitless.
He calls me in and hands me that.
Forgive me for prying
into the details of our investigation.
I know, it's annoying.
But what the hell are you guys doing?
Yeah?
Is that Avon's money?
Eastside addresses...
but maybe Barksdale has fronts
we don't know about.
-State's attorney's returning this?
-Fast as he can.
Y'all are stirring some shit here.
Why didn't you tell me?
Aren't you better off that we didn't?
I remember my mom used to bring me here.
We used to go to a place
called Fruit Fantasy.
-Like orange soda, some shit like that?
-No, these shits was fresh.
My mom used to pour
mad Bacardi in hers though.
Wasn't much she didn't pour it into.
Look at you, talking about your mama
like you're still a kid.
I got to thinking on her.
Your ass ain't got to be hard
all the goddamn time, neither.
Soft link break the chain.
What are you, a boy or a man?
I'm a man.
So what are we gonna do, man,
go have some fun?
Okay, on this floor.
It's the second room from the rear.
The stairs start 30 paces from the front...
there's 24 stairs, about a foot each.
When you get to the top floor...
it's eight paces to the door
of the dressing room...
and then another 10 to the back room.
80 to 1 10 in from the front.
Third floor of this building is vacant.
Otherwise we'd need a warrant.
-$15.
-Here take $10.
-$15.
-Motherfucker, I don't see no meter.
Get the fuck out of here.
It's 2:30 in the morning.
Easy now. Hole only needs
to be as big as your finger.
Not those Esskay sausage-looking
fingers you got.
You know what big hands mean.
You know what big hands mean, right?
Lieutenant...
I just pulled a fresh address
for Wallace's mother.
We're okay here.
Where y'all at?
All right, when I find y'all, y'all gonna get it.
You better come out now.
Where y'all at?
Look, I'm not even playing
with y'all right about now.
You hear me?
Game over. Where the fuck y'all at?
When I find y'all, I'm beating your asses.
Now where y'all at?
Don't let me find y'all.
Check this, Poot.
Little Man left his player and shit.
You a weak-ass nigger, man.
You should've stayed down
in the country, man.
Y'all my niggers, yo.
You fucking brought this on yourself.
-We boys!
-You brought this on yourself.
Why it gotta be like this?
You my niggers from B.C., remember that?
Come on, wetting your fucking pants,
like you a little boy.
Be a man! Stand up
like a motherfucking man.
-Y'all my niggers.
-You said you a fucking man.
-Stand up straight!
-That's us, man.
Do it goddamnit, if you....
Darcia Wallace? We're looking for your son.
Thought you might help us out
as to his whereabouts.
Where-a-who?
Shit, I be looking for that
smart little nigger, too.
Boy took me for $10.
-Recently?
-What's going on out there?
Nothing.
Couple of police interrupting me,
while I'm trying to get my drink on.
Your son might be in some danger.
He gonna be in some danger
right here if he shows up.
Snatched that $10
out my purse without asking.
-I'll slap the bright out his eyes.
-Here's my card.
You run into him, you call me.
-Y'all got ajeep?
-Over there, man.
All right, let's see what we got here.
He's packing shit up.
What you scratching your head for, man?
How y'all get the safe in here,
and you can't get it out?
Just dial 91 1 and talk to whoever pick up.
Don't say your name or nothing.
Just say there's been
an animal hurt inside the house...
and then you hang up.
What up? So what do you need from me?
I need you to run up to N. Y.C.
to pick up a little something.
Look, I know we tapped and all.
Shit, everybody waiting on the re-up,
but I never made that run before.
Listen, I feel like I don't have
that many people around me...
I could really trust.
Not like I can kin. You follow me?
-All right?
-How much is it?
We just need to maintain.
Put out enough so we can
keep hold of them towers.
-When?
-Tonight.
All right.
What am I driving?
-A rental, no flash.
-Where from?
I don't know where from, man,
one of those places by the airport.
-Yeah.
-We got something real.
-I'm on my way.
-All right.
Shit!
-Which one?
-The rental there, the Taurus.
I gotta say, Lieutenant,
you got mad suction with the federales.
Yeah, Daniels.
Where?
Wallace?
Poor fucking kid.
With Wallace gone,
that's Stringer out of the box.
He was in there
changing his fucking clothes.
You believe that?
Boy had to get himself correct.
We're on. No need for an eyeball.
Let the satellite do the work.
How about I call my lawyer...
have him explain
that whole profiling thing to you?
Mr. Barksdale, our tollbooth cameras...
have you on the G.W. Bridge at 2310 hours...
then re-entering
the turnpike at the same exit...
35 minutes later.
Why did you drive all the way
to New York for half an hour?
Step out of the car, sir.
Keep your hands where I can see them.
Turn around, face the car,
put your hands on the roof.
-Are you carrying any weapons, sir?
-No.
-Any knives, any needles?
-No.
Any illegal substances
I should know about?
Okay. Spread your legs back.
Spread your legs back more.
Okay, slowly bring your
right arm around your back.
Now bring the other one.
-Remember me?
-Lawyer.
Easy. We're just getting started.
Lawyer, motherfucker.
Okay, so you're hard, but guess what?
-I could give a fuck.
-You?
I'm tired of your games.
What, you want me to write a letter,
or some shit like that?
No game we need to run.
You're popped with a kilo of uncut.
Not that you messed up.
You did everything right.
Speed limit, turn signals, working taillights.
Question you gotta ask is...
how'd those troopers know
to pull you over?
Someone else fucked up. You following me?
But it's you they're gonna blame,
and you who's gonna do the jolt.
-Lawyer.
-That'd be Levy, right?
He's getting paid by your uncle,
is that right?
Yeah, he's looking out for your interests.
More than you.
Listen...
I ain't saying another damn thing...
to nobody but my lawyer.
By the way...
your boy Wallace,
shot dead in the low-rises.
That's how y'all take care
of your own, right?
You're a lying motherfucker.
So what?
You want me to write
a letter to his mom, too?
Get the fuck out of here.
You didn't have to send him
the way you did.
In one car?
He should've been trailing a mule.
95 or on the train,
it don't make no difference...
he shouldn't have been there alone.
-Look here, Brianna--
-Ain't you ever heard of a trap-car?
You send my son to New York...
in a motherfucking rental...
and you just let him ride
with that package in the trunk?
-I'm sorry--
-That won't bring him out of prison!
Better make sure that Jew lawyer of yours
earns his money, all right?
-D'Angelo gonna have to do his part.
-Meaning what?
You like the car you driving there, right?
You like this crib? I put you in this crib.
You like it?
Yeah, I mean, we all got a lot
to protect here.
You need to remind him of that.
So when it come down to it,
he can stand up tall.
You ain't gotta worry about my child.
I raised that boy, and I raised him right.
It wasn't me who fucked up.
Really? So who did?
Why the fuck are we here?
Listen, all you need to do
is keep your head through the bail hearing.
We got a good shot
at bringing you home here.
Then what?
Who gonna take the weight for all the shit
in the trunk of that car?
Where's Wallace at?
Where's the boy, String?
D'Angelo, shut your mouth.
Where's Wallace? That's all I want to know.
Kid, you better think.
Where the fuck is Wallace?
String!
Look at me!
Where the fuck is Wallace?
I don't want this Payless-wearing
motherfucker representing me.
I'm gonna get my own man, all right?
So just get back in your car,
and get the fuck back down south.
All right, you stupid motherfucker.
You made your decision.
Yeah, I made my decision.
Where's Wallace at?
Where the fuck is Wallace?
Where's Wallace, String?
String, where the fuck is Wallace?
Stringer!
Bring him in.
-You're done.
-Why?
We have the charge whenever we want it.
Why not stay up on the bug
we've got in his office?
The bug you didn't brief me about.
I thought your little bird
told you everything we did...
a minute after we did it.
One of our people got hurt.
That's supposed to mean something.
We're hunting her shooters...
and by the grace of God
and your good work...
we've got a viable case on our main target.
Just charge Barksdale
with the attempt purchase...
from New York and bring it all home.
What about Stringer, his number two?
He slipped off the hook
when we lost the boy witness.
We've done all we can.
Are you hearing me?
These are the people responsible
for dropping a police.
Not just the shooters,
but the ones who make the dirt happen.
I'm trying to put them down for real,
not for some short-time bit.
That all you're trying to do?
If that's all you're doing,
how is it you have people...
pulling campaign records
and finance reports?
What the fuck has that
got to do with anything?
The money is part of my case.
There was a time
when I was willing to say otherwise...
to let you and all your friends
hide some of that dirt, but not now.
You want to talk about dirt? Have at it.
Talk some shit about
your Eastern district days.
Talk about what was going on back
when you was running wild in the DEU.
-That's just talk.
-Just talk?
FBI field reports.
You came into a lot of money, quick.
And you can go to jail just as quick...
if I start asking the right questions.
This case ends, or you are done.
Hell, I don't even need you
to lock up Barksdale.
I'll have your major debrief your detectives
and type the warrants himself.
This case is done!
You do what you feel.
You wanna pull Avon in on half a case?
You go ahead.
You wanna put my shit in the street?
Feel free.
But the Eastern had a lot of stories.
Mine ain't the only one.
A lot of people came through that district.
If you were gonna do me,
I'd already be done.
But there ain't nothing you fear more
than a bad headline now, is there?
You'd rather live in shit
than let the world see you work a shovel.
You can order warrants, and I'll serve them.
But as long as I have days
left on those dead wires...
this case goes on.
Yo, look at these Delta Force
motherfuckers, man.
-Look at them.
-All right.
-What's up with Levy?
-He said he gonna meet us down there.
I still didn't get this safe
out of here yet, man.
How much money in it?
-$150,000.
-$150,000?
Open it up, man.
No sense in ruining a good safe.
This isn't as much fun
as I thought it would be.
The SWAT guys do love
to break out their toys.
They think it's Tony Montana up there?
They probably haven't
touched a gun in years.
Fuck this shit.
You and me, Lieutenant.
What units are in the alley?
Any sightline to the rear door?
10-4, who has the roof?
We're gonna move in on my command.
Everyone stand by.
We're not gonna need your men today.
Call them back.
-Now wait a minute--
-My case, back your men off.
Catch you later.
Good.
Barksdale's wearing bracelets.
Still no Wee-Bey, no Little Man?
No, nothing there.
This is the best work I ever did.
I never did a case like this.
But it's not enough.
I gotta go back to Auto tomorrow morning.
I just feel like this just ain't finished.
Detective.
Hey, now.
We called earlier, they said you were up...
and by the time we get here,
you're back asleep.
-Been there long?
-No.
20 minutes.
You know, we didn't want to
exactly disturb you.
I'm bored, is all.
Yeah, but still.
So, what you got for me?
-Spreads?
-Yeah.
Little Man. For sure.
That's good. Are you able to write?
Okay. Number two.
I can make Little Man,
because he's in the front...
trying to snatch the cash off the dashboard.
But the other one, he's outside in the dark.
-So....
-So, you know, it's okay.
Is there anyone here that you do recognize?
Sure. Wee-Bey.
All right.
Let me tell you where we're
coming from with the shooters.
We tracked their escape route,
and Landsman came up with their hoodies.
Now, DNA matched...
human hair from one of the hoodies
to Wee-Bey.
Freamon, he tracked
a call from the pay phone...
near the scene, to Stringer Bell's pager.
Now, the caller was
using Bey's beeper code.
Crime lab, they lift a print...
off a soda can near that phone,
and that matches Little Man.
You know, so, you know, I'm saying....
Okay, hear me out.
There's a downside here.
We don't have the guns...
no prints from the scene, no witnesses.
But worse, we're going to be dealing
with a Baltimore city jury...
and a good man is hard to find in this town.
Twelve of them together, especially.
An ID of both your shooters...
will play a whole lot easier come trial.
Yeah.
Sometimes things just got to play hard.
We got everyone on our list except C.C.O.
We hit his mama's house...
and she says that he went up
to Wabash for some court date.
You can get on the computer
and see if any of the Sheriff's deputies...
can snatch him up in some courtroom.
Yeah. No, we got Ronnie Moe.
I'm looking at him
go in the jail van right now.
All right.
-Fished our limit. Let's go home.
-"Sir."
-Huh?
-"Let's go home, sir."
You're looking at
a soon-to-be-made sergeant.
So what I'm saying is,
when we're around the troops...
you got to get used to
showing the proper respect.
So, "Let's go home, sir." All right?
What's the count?
So far we've picked up 1 2.
That leaves seven on the wing.
Anything worthwhile?
Some phone numbers that match,
scraps of nicknames, not much else.
We need something now.
They'll shut us down unless we come up
with something fresh to run with right now.
The wires are dead.
The bug in the club is useless.
They're moving out of there
even as we got up on them.
-To where?
-No clue.
But they're going to have to set up again.
Either Barksdale moves
to reset his distribution...
or he gives up the towers.
-If not Avon, then Stringer.
-And why not Avon?
With no priors, he's out
two hours after the bail review.
What we put on Barksdale
barely makes him break stride.
Okay, so we get a hint of
where they're setting back up.
We ask the State's Attorney for a new bug...
maybe even a wire if we get onto a phone.
Not while the deputy breathes air.
We'll be reassigned
before you finish typing up your affidavit.
How about the feds?
You think the Deputy's
going to let you take this mess federal?
Why does the Deputy need to know?
McNulty, you are a piece of work.
McNulty.
Yeah?
No shit.
No fucking shit.
It's Rhonda Pearlman.
She just got a call from an assistant
public defender in North Jersey...
who claims to represent
a man by the name of D'Angelo Barksdale.
Meet me in Homicide. Bring a tape recorder.
No drug lawyers? No Levy?
-Case got some legs on her, don't she?
-Don't she?
Quarter of a million dollars bail.
You believe that shit?
It hurts to even show that kind of money.
-Where Levy at? He ain't at the club, is he?
-No, club's out. We can't talk there no more.
-Come on, man, let's get out of here.
-What's up, baby?
So, this is it?
Look, before you go anyplace else,
before you talk anyplace else...
we got to think this through.
We're up to almost 20 arrests at last count.
And if you look at the probable cause,
they all read just like yours:
Information from a confidential source.
Don't this seem way too much
for one snitch?
I agree. My gut tells me a wire.
Either a phone or two,
or maybe something in a room somewhere.
Talked to your nephew
on the phone about the Jersey thing?
No. Of course not, man. No phones.
When I talk to him, I talk to him face-to-face,
in my office, in the back of the club.
-Fuck.
-It's good you moved out of there.
I don't know, man.
I mean, if they got a mike up in there...
they got you and me saying all kind of shit.
That reminds me. He said he'd be in tonight.
-Thing is, they take you and leave me?
-That's what's fucking me up, too, man.
Look, we'll know soon enough,
as soon as I start pressing for discovery.
What do you want to do
about the people they locked up?
-We got to pull them.
-That's showing a lot of money.
If we don't,
we run the risk of making them enemies.
Speaking of which,
where are you with your nephew?
Is he going to see the light or what?
Let me tell you something, man.
He family, all right?
He not going to buck.
A day or two in the New Jersey bullpen,
he gonna be crying...
waiting for bail money like the rest of them.
All right.
So, let's run the money through the families,
that'll hide it some.
-And don't use the same bondsman.
-All right.
Look, gentlemen, I know it's early...
I want you to start thinking
about who was charged...
and what kind of time they can do.
One of the ways to limit your exposure
is what's called a structured plea.
That means that you're going to
have to deliver your people...
all of them, down to a man.
I saw your girl today, for the idents.
How's she doing?
Okay, I guess.
She's out of the ICU.
Moving slow, but moving, you know?
Jimmy, you ain't been to see her?
No. I couldn't go in.
This ain't about you, right?
I get back from Jersey, I will.
I will.
You know, Cole and me,
we showed her the spreads.
Picked out Little Man, no problem.
Wouldn't go for Wee-Bey.
So, I tried the fat finger.
Damn near down on my knees begging her...
to make this play easier in court.
You know what she said?
"Sometimes things got to play hard."
Real police.
Oh, yeah.
-What the fuck did you do to her?
-I don't know.
You two in the same car
going to make for a long-ass drive to Jersey.
Shit.
Damn, man, it's just too still in here.
You know what? We can--
This place will be fine.
All we really got to do
is put a little safe in here someplace...
and let them know the count
comes here from now on.
Period.
Damn, boy, when y'all change up, y'all--
Y'all that paranoid?
You ain't even been up in there before.
I'm telling you, sis, this shit is different.
We are not going to talk about
nothing indoors. It's a new day.
Thing is, man,
we got to get back on our feet.
You know, I mean, the longer we hold off...
the harder it's going to be
to maintain the towers.
You want to get it back up,
you lean to me and String here.
-No, I ain't down yet.
-You need to step back.
She's right, bro.
You can't take a second chance here.
You know what I'm saying?
Until you fixed,
sis going to handle that money...
I'm going to handle the products.
-We're here for you.
-All right.
But you tell Roberto,
he got to make it a serious smoker.
I want them motherfucking fiends
in the projects....
I want them dropping like flies.
You feel me?
You send out the word,
you let them know we ain't dead yet.
-What about my nephew?
-Don't fret.
Give me a chance to get with Roberto,
and I'll get up to Dee.
Do what needs doing.
Tell him I'm sorry for putting him
out there like that.
And that I'm going to make it up to him.
You going to make it up.
Most def.
But again, I want to make it clear...
that all of this cooperation
is contingent on a commitment...
that my client finds acceptable.
Failing that...
-everything said in here, stays in here.
-Damn straight.
I'm sure a proffer in Maryland
plays much the same in Jersey, counselor.
And I do agree that with regard to matters...
involving drug trafficking,
your client has been helpful.
He's indicated a willingness to testify
that he was a lieutenant...
in Avon Barksdale's
drug distribution organization...
sold large quantities of drugs for his uncle.
Delivered money,
attended organizational meetings...
and on one occasion made a trip
to New York on the behest of his uncle.
All of which corroborates
much of what we already know.
What else is there?
The murders.
Man, why do you keep on that?
I already told you...
I don't know nothing about
that witness being killed.
Which witness?
Remember her?
Jesus.
-They did her?
-Yeah, about the same time they did the boy.
All of them bodies.
-They covering up, man.
-Yeah, that's what we think.
-No loose ends.
-I can understand the guard.
She got paid, so she had to go.
Orlando, he knew too much,
got to snitching, so he had to go.
But then there's the kid...
Wallace.
But I need to go past Argyle Street tonight.
Check in with Wallace.
Wallace?
He off the hook
since we helped the tower crew...
get that stick-up boy.
I'm telling you, man, Wallace is bugging.
Don't hardly even come out
of that room no more.
-Now, why he be like that?
-I'm thinking he might be getting high.
-Wallace?
-The boy's scaring me with his shit.
-All right, holler at me later.
-That'll work.
You got that shit on tape?
-God!
-His name is Brandon Wright.
Burned him, broke fingers,
gouged an eye out, all kinds of fun.
Wallace was the one who saw.
He saw the boy.
But he really didn't
think about what they'd do.
You must have known.
You were standing there by that pay phone.
-You knew.
-What was I going to do?
I don't call String, word get back uptown,
what's going to happen then?
So, you told Wallace to wait,
then you called Stringer...
and Stringer, he gathered the troops.
Yeah.
And down at the Greek's,
they got Wallace to point the finger, right?
Then they went in like cops with handcuffs,
so they could take their time on Brandon.
They dropped the body where we'd see it.
"Send a message to the 'jects," they said.
Wallace...
he couldn't handle that.
After seeing that, he wanted to get out...
go back to school.
We even joked about it,
him being 16 and all...
needing to go start back
over again as a freshman.
About a week ago, my uncle and String,
they called me down to the club.
Stringer, he's all worried about Wallace,
and I told him.
I said, "Wallace ain't no snitch."
Plus, he's out the fucking game.
I told him that.
But I needed to do more.
I should've done more...
but I didn't, and, fuck, that's on me.
Any idea who they sent at Wallace?
Come on, Dee, wild guess.
Man, I don't know, could've been anybody.
You know, shooters come cheap.
I don't think so. Not in the Pit.
Not in his crib.
I counted seven beds when I was up there.
-Where were the young'uns?
-Look, if I knew, I would tell you.
All right? I swear to God, I would tell you.
They've charged with Orlando
and the undercover cop...
but we're still hunting.
Him, he in Philly.
-How you know?
-I know 'cause I dropped him there.
Where?
I don't know, a corner, North end,
I don't know where he be staying.
Did Wee-Bey say anything
to you about the shootings?
We don't talk shop in the car.
It's a rule we got.
So, is that it?
Your client must realize
that any agreement...
is dependent on his full cooperation.
There ain't nothing else.
Deidre.
Tap, tap, tap.
She was one of my uncle's girls.
But we got people who put you with her
the night she's killed.
Yeah, I didn't know
that he was going to do her.
I swear. They played me.
How so?
My uncle gave me an eight-ball of coke.
Told me to take it over there to her.
I was surprised, 'cause, you know,
I thought he dumped her.
But he said, no, it wasn't like that no more.
So, he had Wee-Bey take me over there.
You know, I walked up,
knocked on the door...
she came to the door, all naked and shit,
with this little-ass robe on.
So, she's your uncle's girl,
but she comes to the door for you naked?
She used to do that shit
with me all the time, man.
Teasing. You know how girls do.
Maybe you don't.
I don't know.
Anyway, I'm like,
"Ain't you going to let me come in?"
She says "No,"
because she got to get ready...
for my uncle to come by later.
So, I give her the coke.
She laughs about how she's going to
put that shit on ice, for later on.
Refrigerate it.
I don't know shit about no refrigerator.
Like I said, I didn't go in.
I turned around,
started walking back to the truck...
and I heard this shot.
Wee-Bey, he come running back with
this big-ass .45 he liked to use so much.
Tells me how he was tapping
on the window, real soft.
How with the lights on,
she had to walk all the way up...
because she couldn't see
what was on the outside.
And when she gets up
to the window and looks out....
You did good, D'Angelo.
Yeah, you did.
Y'all don't understand, man.
Y'all don't get it.
You grow up in this shit.
My grandfather was Butch Stamford.
You know who Butch Stamford
was in this town?
All my people, man,
my father, my uncles, my cousins...
it's just what we do.
You just live with this shit...
until you can't breathe no more.
I swear to God,
I was courtside for eight months...
and I was freer in jail than I was at home.
What are you looking for?
I want it to go away.
-I can't--
-I want what Wallace wanted.
I want to start over.
That's what I want. I don't care where.
Anywhere. I don't give a fuck.
I just want to go somewhere
where I can breathe like regular folk.
You give me that...
and I'll give you them.
No, that's great. Really great.
No, that's great. Really great.
Yeah.
That's our move.
Okay.
We broke it open tonight. Wide open.
I'm bringing this case in big.
So, this squares things with Burrell, right?
To hell with the man.
But I think we might have enough
to reach out to the feds...
try to run this thing through them.
Cedric.
He knows about the money, Marla.
He's known for a long while.
Fact is, I wouldn't be surprised
if it's why he picked me for this case.
What does he.... What are you going to--
He's got me if he wants me.
Thing is, I don't think he wants me.
Too much at stake.
Too much mess.
Kind of like this case.
I have to admit it, Jimmy,
this is a great case.
Not just because of Greggs,
because it goes to that and answers that...
but because of how deep it goes.
I mean, the murders, the money--
Jesus, I feel like I've been drunk
ever since that kid started talking to us.
You okay to drive?
I can drop you home.
You can pick up your car tomorrow.
No, I'm good.
I'm great, this was fucking great!
You want to try to go federal with this?
I am up for it.
I get cross-designated as an AUSA,
and we can really run with it, you know?
Career fucking case.
Anyway....
Ronnie, the thing at...
Levy's the other day, I was....
I was--
Jesus, Ronnie, not here.
What are you doing?
Like you never did it
in the headquarters garage before?
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Look what just walked in
without a fucking escort.
Downtown Roy Brown, the living legend...
in his own mind.
Uptown Lester Freamon.
Fuck me, how long's it been?
Your retirement party, wasn't it?
And this is retirement?
Yeah. Nice fucking digs?
I asked my supervisor when
I'll see a little sunlight.
Runt cocksucker says,
"When your unit turns a profit."
But enough of my joy.
What do you guys need?
We need a trap and trace,
but not in Maryland.
-Pennsylvania, Philly.
-You got to go through them.
We try that, we lose a week,
they tell us it can't be done...
then another week to okay our subpoena.
It's a little more complicated
than just a straight-up trace.
We actually need a list of phones in Philly
that called this number in the past week.
-What's the number?
-Drug lawyer, downtown office.
Thought Billing would be the place to look.
If we can do it, and I'm not saying we can...
it's going to be a fucking week, maybe two.
Thanks, Roy.
Lester, isn't this supposed to be the time...
you tell me how
all-fired fucking important this is?
The Philly number gives us the mope
who shot that female undercover.
I'm telling you, Fitz, it's the perfect case.
-You'll love it.
-It sounds great.
But like I said, Jimmy,
we're not fishing for drug cases anymore.
Try DEA.
No, that field office is too close to our CID.
We go there, our bosses know it
before a meeting is scheduled.
Your bosses don't know you're doing this?
Who'll be coming?
Me, a detective name of Freamon,
and Daniels.
I can speak for Daniels, brother.
He's played this thing out with real heart.
Come on, set something up.
All right.
Could I get 10 copies?
-10 copies?
-10, right.
No problems?
No.
No?
All right, man, I'll get at you.
You locked that door, right?
Yeah? All right, so listen.
It's not street-ready, all right?
So, everybody got to work
on their own cut and vial up.
Now, listen to me,
tell them to get this straight.
Three parts of this, all right?
To one of raw, all right?
And that's how we gonna do
until we get the new stash.
And I want you to put the word out there
that we're back up.
Understand me?
We're back up.
It's a good target.
You guys have a pretty good case here.
Look at the violence alone.
There's at least a dozen murders,
including state's witnesses.
If you can help us squeeze the Barksdale kid
into a witness protection program...
we can run wild with this thing.
-No suppliers though.
-We're still looking for a way into that.
There was nothing on the wire
that took us toward New York.
The trouble is,
we have these post-9l1 1 protocols.
We can't pick up any new narcotics work...
unless it goes to priority
organized-crime targets.
Meaning Cosa Nostra or Colombians.
Or Russians maybe.
We don't have any Colombians in Baltimore.
We don't have any wise guys.
All we got is a whole lot of locals
a little busy tearing the Westside apart.
I hear you,
but the Bureau-wide protocol applies.
To run with you on this,
we need a recognized OC target...
or, even better, a connect to
counterterrorism or corruption.
You go near stuff like that...
we have something
we can bring to our ASAC.
What kind of corruption?
Don't know.
What kind you got?
Poot, we up yet?
-Where Roc-Roc at with the shit?
-Package in.
Who is it?
-Onion and them off-brand niggers.
-Onion?
-What the fuck they got?
-Some shit they call yellow tops.
Yellow tops?
Got them yellow tops, y'all, yellow tops.
Yellows tops.
-Got them yellow tops.
-Motherfucker, what the fuck is up?
Fuck is y'all doing?
Do what you feel.
But be ready to finish what you start.
What you doing?
This ain't no open market, you know that.
Ain't no market at all, nigger.
You ain't got shit to sell.
Back that ass up for those that do.
-You know what?
-What?
Get the fuck out of here, bitch!
-See, that's why we can't win.
-Why not?
-They fuck up, they get beat.
-We fuck up, they give us pensions.
Close it! Get the fuck out of here!
Heard you ain't much as an eyeball witness.
Bad as any civilian.
Guess so.
Where we at?
With what?
With the case, fool.
Jesus, give it a rest.
What's on the wire?
-Come on, man.
-Wire's dead.
They changed up after we
hit them with raids.
Daniels didn't tell you?
Hell, no.
He only talks to me about the good shit.
About how y'all were
onto my shooters and stuff.
Yeah, well, we lost the wire,
but the good news is D'Angelo's flipped...
-and we're talking to the feds about maybe--
-Fuck both y'all.
She wants me to quit.
Says there ain't nothing worth this.
So, I promised her I'd think about it.
What do you say?
I don't know.
I guess you should do what you need to.
But she's right.
It isn't worth it.
No?
Yeah. Probably not.
Anyway, what took you so long
getting up in here?
Shit, no cards, no flowers.
I mean, what the fuck, Jimmy?
I couldn't, l...
I felt....
A case like this, it's always you or Sydnor...
or some other black cop
who ends up going undercover.
I swear, if I could do it over....
If l....
If I could do it over...
you know what I'd do?
Put more tape on that fucking gun.
I'm sorry, Kima.
I'm sorry.
Anyway, since I got you up in here...
acting like my bitch and shit...
with all your guilty-ass crying
and whatnot...
maybe you can do something for me.
She said you were doing good.
Said she was proud of you.
How's she doing?
Still shook.
But she wanted you to have that...
and told me to tell you
she's sorry to be late with it.
Girl got such heart, you know?
Yeah.
This is enough for what
I got going now, man.
You give the rest back to her.
Are you sure?
Give her my love.
Right.
McNulty.
Don't tell her.
-What you got, man?
-Over there, man.
Un-fucking-believable.
Five guys got jumped. Not just you.
-Four other guys jumped me.
-I'm sorry, man.
It's got to be all the brutality complaints...
which means it ain't never gonna matter
how well I do on no fucking test.
You don't know that.
You might make the next list, you know?
You don't know.
Guess I ain't leadership material.
-Congratulations, Carv.
-Thanks.
Yeah?
The world is on its ass.
Guy called for you from the phone company.
Says he's got the number you wanted
for a house in Philadelphia.
Beautiful, thank you.
-Good casework.
-Thank you.
I don't think I'm giving anything away...
by telling that Arnold here
has had a file on Senator Davis...
for two and a half years.
It took us a while to see it,
but the quid pro quo is right there...
in that Westside redevelopment mess.
Barksdale, or his fronts,
grease enough city politicians...
and word comes back years in advance
where the development zone's going to be.
He buys up every piece
of garbage real estate he can...
flips it three or four times,
exaggerating the values.
The city's gonna pay him millions...
to condemn the properties
for the renewal project.
It's a lot to work with, but we're willing.
The question is,
can your cooperator give us the senator...
or any other political figure?
-The cooperator?
-D'Angelo Barksdale.
What does he have for us on the money?
Nothing.
He gives you the drugs and the violence.
He gives you Avon Barksdale, Stringer Bell.
-And they give us the senator.
-Maybe, yeah.
You're talking about turning Barksdale
and Bell into cooperators...
and making the politicians
the primary target?
Of course.
No, fuck the politicians.
It's Barksdale and Bell.
No, fuck the politicians.
It's Barksdale and Bell.
Those guys have
turned West Baltimore into a free-fire zone.
No one's saying they walk.
What you are saying is that
if we bring you the case...
it's your intention to let Barksdale
and Bell reduce any sentence...
they get through cooperation?
Jesus Christ, are you kidding?
You're seeing all this ass-backwards.
Detective, in this office we have a mandate
to pursue political corruption.
Can you believe these guys?
-Jimmy, look.
-What?
Drugs and murder don't cut it anymore?
How about terrorism?
These guys have dropped 14, 15 bodies.
The witnesses, cooperators--
That kind of hyperbole
doesn't serve anyone, detective.
I think we're going with
a different direction on this.
Thank you for your time.
West Baltimore is dying,
and you empty suits...
are running around trying to pin
some politician's pelt to the wall.
Thought you was real police, brother.
So, they got you all the way out here?
I started out thinking you was in Jersey.
You ain't in Jersey.
I figured they still got you
down in Central Booking.
But, all the way out here....
Do send a message, though.
Yeah, a message needs sending.
How y'all even find me?
Ain't no one going to keep
a mother from her son, right?
You know, he's always talking family.
"Family is the heart," he say.
Well, I'm family...
ain't l?
What about me for once?
It ain't right.
What's right?
You like for him to step up,
take all the weight, and let you walk?
Because he will. You know he will.
But if he got to go away...
that mean you got to step up
and fill his shoes.
You ready for that?
Ma, you know I ain't.
I ain't ready,
and I'm never gonna be ready for this game.
-Dee, come on.
-Look.
They're giving me a chance to walk away...
to start again someplace else.
And what you giving them?
Look....
He messed up, Dee, he knows it.
Now if you want to get even
with him, you can.
But if you hurt him,
you hurt this whole family.
All of us. Me and Trina and the cousins.
And Donette, too. And your baby.
Your own baby boy.
This right here is part of the game, Dee.
And without the game...
this whole family would be
down in the fucking Terrace...
Iiving off scraps.
Shit, we probably wouldn't even be a family.
Start over?
How the fuck you going to
start over without your peoples?
Without your own child, even?
If you ain't got family in this world...
what the hell you got?
This motherfucker Wee-Bey twitches,
there won't even be a trial.
Detective Carver, a word?
Shut the door.
What's up, Lieutenant?
Anything you want to tell me?
Been weeks now...
the Deputy Ops knows what's going on
in this unit almost before I do.
Except last week...
we run the bug up
into Barksdale's club office...
and Burrell, for once, he's a step behind.
You see it?
-Maybe he--
-I see it.
I look around the office...
and I see that one of my people
is at the academy for in-service.
Lieutenant, I swear, it wasn't my idea.
I'm minding my business,
doing my fucking job...
when the man calls me
for coffee and a Danish.
I mean, I never even been on
the eighth floor of that fucking building.
And there's the Deputy fucking Ops...
telling me how concerned
he is about the case...
how he needs to be informed.
I mean, he's the Deputy fucking Ops, man.
Couple weeks from now...
you're gonna be
in some district somewhere...
with 1 1 or 1 2 uniforms
looking to you for everything.
And some of them
are going to be good police.
Some of them are going to
be young and stupid.
A few are going to be pieces of shit.
But all of them will take their cue from you.
You show loyalty, they learn loyalty.
You show them it's about the work,
it'll be about the work.
You show them some other kind of game,
then that's the game they'll play.
I came on in the Eastern...
and there was a piece-of-shit lieutenant
hoping to be a captain...
piece-of-shit sergeants
hoping to be lieutenants.
Pretty soon we had piece-of-shit patrolmen
trying to figure the job for themselves.
And some of what happens then
is hard as hell to live down.
Comes a day you're going to have to decide
whether it's about you or about the work.
Grand jury came in Tuesday.
But you knew that, right?
We're working a flight warrant today.
There's a lot to do here, in-office.
I'd be careful with that, though.
I understand the trigger pull
used to be light.
Keep him down, keep him down.
You got him? Get him up there, get him up.
Bunch of low-bottom bitches.
-Get his wrists.
-Y'all didn't have to fuck with my ride.
Motherfuckers got lucky.
Yeah?
Podunk lawyer in Denton's
giving the guards a hard time...
about moving D'Angelo
from original jurisdiction.
Put the call through.
Okay.
Officer Mace, ASA Pearlman,
you got a problem with the lawyer?
Okay, put the asshole on.
This is he.
You do not make it easy, Jimmy.
I have to admit, I am deeply ambivalent.
-Excuse me?
-Sit.
Sit!
-Here.
-I heard from Bunk.
Philly. Great work.
You all did great work.
And the number of clearances
I'm looking at here...
Christ, for the first time this year,
we got the clearance rate up over 40%.
That's on the one hand.
On the other hand, I know the Deputy Ops
got a call from the first deputy...
U.S. Attorney this morning...
asking whether an asshole such as yourself
really works for us.
Of course, this is the first the Deputy
hears his troops...
are creeping behind his back
to take a case federal...
when they've already been told
the case is closed.
You're a good detective.
And I've got to admit
you got some stones on you.
Did you actually call
the first deputy an empty suit?
I want to see you land okay, Jimmy.
So, tell me, where don't you want to go?
You all know that Baltimore city jurors
are capable of just about anything.
Now, look, you want to sit
around for months on end...
going through a bunch of half-heard...
half-said telephone conversations
and see how well you do...
-I'll certainly respect the effort.
-It's not just talk on the wire.
We've got seized money
and lot of dope on the table.
And a lot of violence.
All of which stops
way short of Mr. Barksdale.
You know this.
All of it except for the New Jersey bust.
That one he eats.
Maybe he does.
Maybe he pleads to one count
of attempted possession...
and takes, I don't know, maybe three, four.
Maybe he can arrange
for everyone you have...
on those tapes to follow suit.
Maybe you get five-year pleas from those
with no prior felony convictions...
10 years for those with one prior,
15 for two or more.
What about the murders?
Maybe we acknowledge
you've got Mr. Brice cold for...
murder of Orlando Blocker
and wounding of the police officer.
-Who?
-Wee-Bey.
Representing Mr. Brice...
I'm fairly confident that
to avoid the death penalty...
he'll proffer to at least a half dozen
of your open murders.
Naming co-conspirators?
For that kind of cooperation,
I'd be willing to consider straight life.
No, indeed.
I believe Mr. Brice is ready
to take sole responsibility...
for all of his crimes.
Still, you walk away
with at least a half-dozen clearances.
Assets.
You take the strip club,
you take whatever trucks and cars...
you can link to the drug trafficking,
and also whatever cash you've seized.
He's got dozens of other properties:
the funeral parlor, the towing company.
No. You get the cars,
because you can tie them to illegal activity.
No. You get the cars,
because you can tie them to illegal activity.
But there's nothing else of his to take.
So, you keep most of the money,
most of the real estate...
and Stringer Bell stays on the street
with his hand on the throttle.
If you have a charge against Mr. Bell, file it.
Otherwise, I understand that nothing
in all those hours of tape implicates him.
Three or four years ain't enough, Maury.
Not for Avon Barksdale.
No?
Make an offer.
Part 14 of the circuit court
of Baltimore City now in session.
-Be seated.
-First up.
-Be seated.
-First up.
State versus Avon Randolph Barksdale,
Your Honor.
One count of possession
with intent to distribute...
to wit, a kilogram of heroin.
-You have a statement of facts?
-Yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Barksdale is offering a plea of guilty...
in exchange for a maximum
of seven years in DOC...
in consideration of
the following agreed-upon facts:
On or about the date
of September 17, 2002...
in the jurisdiction
of Essex County, New Jersey...
Trooper Robert Warren
of the Newark barracks...
effected a traffic stop
on a rented Ford Taurus...
traveling southbound near Exit 13.
That traffic stop resulted
from information gleaned...
from electronic surveillance of Mr. Barksdale
and his nephew, D'Angelo Barksdale...
by detectives assigned to a special detail...
under the command
of a city narcotics supervisor.
A search of the vehicle, rented
from the Avis location at B.W.I. Airport...
revealed that a kilogram
of nearly pure heroin...
was concealed beneath
the spare tire in the car trunk.
In accepting this plea, Mr. Barksdale
acknowledges his role in procuring...
those drugs with the intent to dilute,
package, and sell retail amounts of heroin....
Deidre Kresson, Roland Leggett,
Toreen Boyd, all tied to the same gun.
Plus, we got the stick-up boys,
Brandon Wright, John Bailey.
With Orlando, that makes six.
Plus the attempted murder on a police.
That it?
-I do better if I give them more?
-Life, no parole, means what it says.
This proffer keeps you off death row.
That's all it does.
You were on the wrong side
of a cop getting shot, Mr. Brice.
You want to dream
about straight life for these bodies...
you got to wake up
talking about Avon Barksdale...
-and Stringer Bell.
-No.
But for murders, you might as well
give them what you have...
because anything you leave out
is outside the deal.
If they learn about it later,
they can charge you later.
Fuck it then.
For another pit sandwich
and some potato salad...
I'll go a few more.
-How you want that?
-Medium rare, a lot of horseradish.
All right, I did Little Man...
thinking he might get weak
on that cop getting shot.
Yeah? Where's the body?
Druid Hill. Behind the reptile house.
You get back in them weeds,
you might could find what's left of him.
All right, that's seven. What else you got?
How about them witnesses?
The security lady,
and what's his name, the maintenance man?
Gant?
Yeah, Gant.
You did Gant alone?
They're out of potato salad.
How about slaw?
Information gleaned
from electronic surveillance...
would also show that
Mr. Watkins, a.k.a. Ronnie Moe...
was integrally involved in the distribution
of heroin and cocaine in the high-rises...
at 734 Fayette and 221 North Fremont.
In exchange for his pleading guilty
to one count of conspiracy...
he agrees to a sentence
not to exceed 15 years in DOC.
Mr. Watkins, who is on probation
for a drug distribution charge...
that was adjudicated
in judge Prevas' court in August, 2001 ....
Cedric!
Major Cantrell.
-Congrats.
-Thanks.
-So, where they sending you?
-Northwest. Spurgeon's retiring.
-I heard that was going to happen.
-Ever feel like a change, give a yell.
I could use a good shift lieutenant.
I mean, right now, the whole
fucking district's a mess.
What isn't?
-Good seeing you.
-You, too.
You see, this ain't no DEU. It ain't like that.
When you all came downtown,
the job changed.
Down here, we make big cases,
big hairy-balled cases...
Iike this Barksdale thing, right?
And all that mess
you call police work down in the districts...
all that fuck-somebody-up
and rip-and-run bullshit...
it won't play down here.
You think I'm kidding.
This is what makes cases, gentlemen.
This!
Remember that.
Nicely done.
Motherfucker, I been here
since lunch, waiting.
Ain't nobody been through here.
You hear me?
I been waiting and y'all ain't about shit.
Yeah, listen, listen to me.
Look, if you feel like that,
then get off this phone...
come down here
and step to me then, nigger.
Yeah, all right.
Yo, if Roc-Roc ain't here
in 10 minutes with my re-up...
whoop his ass, man.
I understand you did
a tour in Homicide years ago...
but let me tell you how I run this unit,
because how I run it is how it runs.
We work on a strict rotation.
You're up until you catch a call...
then you step down, work your case,
and someone else steps up behind you.
This is the way we do business in a town
with 250, 300 murders a year.
And it works.
You do not play the game for yourself,
you play it for us.
If you remember these few rules...
you'll find me to be
supportive and reasonable.
Very reasonable, sir.
-That's what they say about me.
-They say that, they do.
Yo, Dink!
What the fuck was that?
You take a nigger's money,
then you serve him?
What the fuck?
I'm saying, you take their money...
then you send them round
and let some other nigger serve.
The way you doing it...
someone snapping pictures
got the whole deal.
You hear?
We got to tighten up around here, yo!
Jimmy.
Hell of a case.
Read all about it in the papers.
You done good, kiddo.
I gotta....
D'Angelo Barksdale
supervised distribution...
in the low-rise courtyards
and was also involved...
in the violence attributed
to the organization.
Further, he was arrested
by authorities in New Jersey...
in possession of a kilo of raw heroin
intended for distribution in Baltimore.
He acknowledges his role
as a leading conspirator...
and is already on parole
for two earlier counts of distribution...
dating from March, 1999.
What are you asking here?
As Mr. Barksdale has two prior convictions
and is insisting that the effort to purchase...
and transport the kilo
was done on his own behest...
and is refusing to cooperate against others
in the conspiracy...
the state is offering only the maximum
allowable 20 years, Your Honor.
Mr. Levy, this is your understanding
of the plea agreement?
-Yes, sir.
-Very well then, Mr. Barksdale.
-Can you hear me distinctly?
-Yes.
Are you now under
the influence of alcohol....
-Wee-Bey, man.
-How'd it go?
For life, no parole,
he puts himself in for Orlando...
and the attempt murder on Greggs.
Then he also takes Nakeisha Lyles...
Deidre Kresson, the two project murders
that match that gun...
both the stick-up boys, and Little Man.
Little Man?
Yeah, body found up behind
the reptile house in Druid Hill.
He gave us that one just for fun, I think.
He also takes William Gant.
I know, it's bullshit.
How'd he tell it?
-Boom.
-He said a contact wound?
It doesn't play.
Gant had no compression, no stippling.
Wound was to the front.
Bey's talking out of his ass.
I know, but this motherfucker's
just taking murders just to take them.
He's taking life, no parole,
for shooting a cop, what the fuck?
Might as well try to spring Bird
for killing Gant.
All rise.
Jesus, what the fuck did I do?
You happy now, bitch?
Are you the man with them jumbo sixes?
-How many you fucking want?
-Take about three or four hundred.
Damn.
All in the game, yo.
Right, but I didn't think--
For sure.
Tout ce qu'on fait,
c'est se geler les couilles.
Arrête de râler, ça va pas durer.
Encore deux mois, et c'est le printemps.
Le printemps ? C'est quoi, ça ?
Patience, tu finiras par comprendre que les
chefs t'ont fait une fleur en t'envoyant ici.
- Citywide à unité de marine.
- Oui, sept six, sept deux, on vous écoute.
Allez-y. Appel de détresse d'un bateau privé
blanc, dix-huit mètres. Moteurs morts.
Bien reçu. Quelle est sa position ?
Il est ancré dans le canal, près du pont, à
environ deux kilomètres du quai Armistead.
Dix quatre, on le prend en charge.
POLICE DE BALTIMORE
C'est ici que mon père bossait.
- À la métallurgie ?
- Sur le chantier naval, oui.
J'avais un oncle qui était contremaître dans
ce foutoir. Ils l'ont viré en 78.
73, mon père.
- Une petite fête au large ?
- Sympa, non ?
- Pourtant, il y a plusieurs moteurs.
- Sûrement un problème électrique.
Les Gains du Capitole - Washington
C'est un bateau de la police ?
Comment allez-vous ?
Je suis heureux de vous voir.
Henry, toujours en vie ?
- Bienvenue à bord. Un verre ?
- Non, merci.
- C'est vous, le capitaine ?
- Oui.
- C'est le port qui vous envoie ?
- Non, c'est la police de la ville.
- Alors, vous êtes en rade ?
- Je crois que c'est le démarreur.
- Vous êtes mécanicien ?
- Moi ? Non.
Je confonds encore la poupe et la proue.
Le mieux que j'ai à vous offrir,
c'est un remorquage.
Hé, Claude !
Le yacht, on le prend en remorque.
- OK. Jusqu'à Henderson.
- C'est parti.
Vous ne pourriez pas attendre un peu,
avant de nous ramener à quai ?
La fête bat son plein,
et je voudrais ne pas devoir l'écourter
pour problème matériel.
Écoutez, vous êtes
en plein milieu du chenal.
Arrangez-vous pour qu'on ne soit plus dans
le passage. Tout le monde continue à rigoler.
SUR ÉCOUTE
"Ça sera plus jamais comme avant."
- Little Big Roy
... enfin, tu me comprends ?
C'est vrai, en trois ans de vol de bagnoles,
qu'est-ce que j'ai appris ?
Rien. Je m'en foutais.
J'avais même plus envie de faire partie
de la police.
Vraiment.
Et si j'y réfléchis, je crois que c'est
à cause de ça que j'ai flingué ma voiture.
Mais le bordel qu'on a mis chez Barksdale,
avec les filatures, les écoutes et tout ça,
ça ressemblait à quelque chose.
Et à quelque chose qui me plaisait.
Alors je me suis dit :
"Voilà, les Stups, ce serait bien."
C'est moi, commandant.
Je vous les pose où ?
Mais je ne sais pas,
posez-les contre le radiateur.
Bon, pour les Stups, si j'arrive pas
à avoir un poste sur le terrain,
j'enquête sur l'aspect financier,
le blanchiment.
Hé, doucement, doucement.
Doucement, les gars, ça casse.
N'empêche, avec ce boulot sur Barksdale,
avec Freamon, on est vraiment entrés là où
il y avait du fric. Vraiment beaucoup.
On aurait pu saisir l'immobilier, l'argent
liquide, les véhicules, un max de trucs.
Pourquoi les boss, pourquoi la hiérarchie
nous a pas laissés continuer l'enquête ?
On les tenait, quoi.
- Jette un oeil là-dessus. C'est la colombe.
- Ah, d'accord.
- Alors, qu'est-ce que tu en dis ?
- Ce que j'en dis ?
J'en dis que tu vas passer un examen
pour être sergent le mois prochain,
car j'ai d'excellentes relations
avec Andy Krawczyk
et que, de son côté,
il a d'excellentes relations avec la mairie.
Tu vas donc devenir sergent.
Quand tu seras sergent,
tu bosseras ici, dans le sud-est,
et parce que je suis ton beau-père,
tu ne bosseras que de jour,
et tu seras affecté à un quartier tranquille.
Ensuite, tu passeras lieutenant,
en obtenant encore de brillants résultats.
Je tiens pas à courir après les galons.
Je veux mener des enquêtes,
de vraies enquêtes.
Roland.
Écoute-moi bien.
Dans l'affaire de drogue, tu t'en es bien tiré.
Il est prouvé que tu avais tout d'un bon flic.
Et, à l'exception de cette affaire
avec le Grand Jury,
tu t'es débarrassé de cette étiquette pourrie
qu'on t'avait mise sur le dos.
Maintenant, mon gars, si tu la fermes,
et surtout si tu m'écoutes,
t'as peut-être une chance de faire
une jolie carrière dans mon service.
- Hé ! Elle marche quand elle veut, ta radio.
- On la perd, c'est tout.
- Qui ? La station, on perd.
- Quoi, la station ?
Ben, oui. On est trop loin de Baltimore,
alors la station, on la perd.
- Essaie de capter un truc sur Philadelphie.
- C'est pas la même radio ?
Arrête, man, je supporte pas
qu'on se foute de ma gueule.
T'as jamais écouté la radio
en dehors de Baltimore ?
Non, je suis jamais sorti de Baltimore,
sauf pour aller en maison de correction.
Un seul jour, et il n'y avait pas la radio
dans leur putain de piège pourri.
Arrête, merde, arrête.
Ça m'énerve, je te jure. Arrête.
On bénéficie d'un climat véritablement
excellent pour les tomates,
avec ces belles journées ensoleillées et
une humidité élevée à la tombée de la nuit.
- Ils écoutent ça, à Philadelphie ?
- Qu'est-ce que j'en sais, moi ?
Faut vraiment être malade
pour quitter Baltimore, tu crois pas, toi ?
Ça doit être là, la sortie.
Ben, alors, faut la prendre.

- Bienvenue à bord, vieux.
- Viens, je te fais visiter.
- Laisse tomber !
- Pourquoi, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Bunk ne sait pas nager.
Et il est pas sûr que t'arrives à le sauver.
Alors, qu'est-ce qui l'amène
au bord de l'eau ?
Ilene Nathan a appelé.
L'affaire "Gant" sort dans quatre semaines.
Elle veut commencer les préliminaires
avec les témoins.
Alors, bien sûr, avec la vieille du quartier,
il n'y aura pas trop de problèmes.
Mais ton mec, Omar, lui,
il est dans la nature.
T'as des infos sur Omar, Jimmy ?
- Apparemment, il n'est pas à tribord.
- Là, c'est bâbord, ignorant.
- Putain, comment tu sais ça, toi ?
- Arrête.
Allez, viens, je t'invite à déjeuner,
on aura le temps de discuter.
Attends, il faut que le sergent
soit d'accord.
Oh, tiens ! Ça m'y fait penser.
Landsman veut ses dix dollars.
- C'est quoi, cette histoire ?
- Il avait parié que tu conduirais un bateau.
Tu vas aller dire à cet enfoiré
qu'il fasse une croix sur son pognon,
d'autant plus que c'est sûrement lui
qui a dit à Rawls où je ne voulais pas aller.
- Jimmy, c'est plus pareil, sans toi, là-bas.
- Ah oui ?
C'est mieux, en fait.
T'es sûr ? Joue pas avec ça, mec.
Si le canal est dragué,
ça veut dire qu'on bosse tous.
Tes hommes à toi, et mes hommes à moi.
Le canal, c'est la solution, et tu le sais.
Ouais, ouais, je sais,
mais je sais aussi combien ça va coûter
pour qu'ils acceptent d'en discuter.
Si on essaie rien, autant se coucher
tout de suite et se laisser mourir.
Faut les convaincre
de reconstruire le quai à grain.
- Il y aurait cent bateaux, ici.
- Oui, mais des vraquiers.
Un ou deux groupes bosseront en extra
sur ces rafiots chaque semaine,
en tout, on aura six ou sept équipes.
Oui, mais, si tu tentes ça, tu as au moins
une toute petite chance que ça marche.
Si tu vas les voir à Annapolis
pour faire draguer ce putain de canal,
tu nous rapporteras que des emmerdes et
une queue si atrophiée qu'on la verra plus.
Et en plus, si le quai à grain
n'est pas très vite remis en état,
alors le premier gros trou du cul friqué
va transformer la zone en lotissements.
- Si tu creuses le canal de 60 centimètres...
- Tu me fais chier avec ton canal.
Je vais aller voir le conseil de district.
D'accord ?
Je vais leur dire de se bouger
et de remettre ce quai en marche.
- T'es content, comme ça ?
- Si tu te calmes, je serais content.
Syndicat de contrôleurs de merde !
Toujours à vous prendre pour des rois !
Nat ! Nat, écoute-moi. Fais-moi...
Ça vous ferait du bien
de retourner dans vos trous.
Faut jamais oublier qui on est
et encore moins oublier d'où on vient.
Merde, Frank !
J'ai sans doute rêvé. J'ai cru voir
Nat Coxson se foutre de ta gueule.
T'y crois ? Il t'a quand même traité
de petite bite ! Et tu le laisses faire !
Sache que tous les matins,
j'ai le cutter tellement en colère
que même les vieilles putes, elles ont peur.
J'allais justement en parler
à ce cher président du quarante-sept,
quand monsieur a cru bon, le con,
de se faire la malle.
- En acier trempé, la bite.
- Arrête.
Vingt-cinq centimètres de métal bleu
prêt à tout défoncer.
- Alors, Nicky ? Tu bosses, aujourd'hui ?
- J'assemble dans l'équipe de Big Roy.
Bravo, petit. C'est la famille
qui doit être contente.
C'est le premier jour en deux semaines,
tu parles.
- Il est dans le coin, Ott ?
- Sur son cul, comme toujours.
Ce vieux rat me doit encore 20 $
sur le dernier loto.
Hé, Nick.
Va voir le Grec, il a un nouveau boulot.
Il en a un qui arrive.
- Aujourd'hui ?
- Demain.
L'Atlantic Light, il arrive à North Point.
OK.
- Ho, Frank !
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Faudrait que t'ailles voir Ziggy, mec.
Il est en train de faire du surplace.
Ça fait huit heures que je suis là !
Tu sais ce que c'est, huit heures, petit ?
- Arrête de crier, ça me gonfle.
- Tu sais à qui tu parles, là ?
Écoute, je vais le trouver.
Mais ça m'aiderait si tu fermais ta gueule.
Comment ça se passe ?
- Aucun problème, chef.
- Mon cul, oui !
Ça fait huit heures que je poireaute
avec mon camion,
- et il sait toujours pas où est le container.
- Mais je vais le trouver, ça va !
Ils en parlent comme d'un truc assez chaud.
Faudrait pas déconner. Il est où ?
- Soit il est sur le quai sept...
- Il est vide, le quai sept.
Mais il n'y est pas. Donc, dans ce cas,
il est, en toute logique,
quelque part dans le secteur.
Je vais l'étrangler, je te jure.
Tu me fais vraiment chier, Ziggy.
Tu me fais vraiment chier.
Trouve-moi le numéro de ton commanditaire,
je l'appelle et j'essaie d'arranger le coup.
Ziggy ?
Je veux plus te voir. Tu te démerdes,
mais tu remets plus jamais les pieds ici !
T'as bien entendu. T'es viré.
Dommage pour toi, crâne d'oeuf.
Mais il est trop con, lui ! Il se retrouve
à la rue et il s'en fout complètement.
- Il l'a pas viré, t'inquiète.
- Ah bon ?
C'est son père.
Il vous le faut pour quand ?
Le procès a lieu dans un mois.
On attaque les préparatifs cette semaine.
Vous êtes là, Burns ?
Inspecteur.
J'avais entendu dire
que vous aviez été muté ici,
mais j'osais pas. Merde.
Ça plaisante pas, là-haut, hein ?
Qu'est-ce qui vous a fait
descendre jusqu'ici ?
Je viens chercher les preuves
dans l'affaire Gant.
En fait, le procès de Bird a lieu dans
un mois et Ilene Nathan veut s'y préparer.
Transmettez-lui mes hommages.
- À qui ?
- À Bird.
- On a rien du tout.
- Comment ça, on a rien du tout ?
Il est dit sur le formulaire : "rangée
double B, section quatorze, étagère trois.
"Quatre, droite, au fond."
C'est ce qui est écrit.
- Et alors ?
- Et alors, on n'a pas ça.
La double B, elle a douze sections,
et là, ils disent quatorze. Vous comprenez ?
On a rien du tout.
Nos hivers rigoureux tuent la plupart
des chenilles à constitution fragile.
- Ils font chier, putain.
- ... des variétés, mieux adaptées, survivent.
Ils font chier.
ROUTE BARRÉE
... malgré tout, utiliser certains produits
pour les éliminer.
Mais c'est un genre de système d'alerte.
Ils y sont.
Franoosh. Te voilà.
Bonjour. Ça devrait suffire.
Viens avec moi.
Tu veux voir ton vitrail ?
Seul Franoosh Sobotka est capable
de faire venir un vitrail d'Esslingen.
Les Allemands ont le coeur dur,
mais ce sont de merveilleux artisans.
Ça me réjouit beaucoup, mon père,
d'avoir pu faire ça pour l'église et tout,
mais en fait, j'ai un service à vous demander.
Je ferai tout ce qui est en mon pouvoir.
- Il me faut un tête à tête avec le sénateur.
- Barbara ?
Elle vient à la première messe
du dimanche, celle en polonais.
On a que des problèmes, mon père.
Il faut qu'on fasse quelque chose
pour les canaux C et D,
et la grainerie n'est plus exploitée
depuis un an.
En confession, j'entends pas mal d'histoires
plutôt terrifiantes, ces derniers mois.
Alors, figure-toi que je me doutais bien que
sur les docks, ça devait pas aller très fort.
Alors vous m'arrangez le coup
avec Mikulski ? Quand ?
Il était inutile de m'offrir un vitrail
allemand pour me demander ça, Francis.
Surtout
que tes dons dépassent largement
ce que j'ai dû payer
pour faire installer le vitrail.
À quand remonte ta dernière confession ?
Au revoir, mon père.
La dope, elle est toujours dans la porte.
Mais non, ils ont dû la mettre ailleurs.
Putain, t'étais là à nous regarder
depuis le début ?
Tu nous as vus sortir un truc de la porte ?
Tu le sais, toi.
Tu l'as vu, qu'il n'y avait rien
dans cette putain de caisse.
- Ouais, ouais.
- Ça va, ça va.
Mais qui va nous croire, hein ?
On l'a pas, c'est tout !
Et ce que tu dis, on s'en fout !
Le seul truc qu'il entendra,
c'est qu'on n'a pas la dope.
Allez, cherche encore.
Il n'y a rien, là-dedans !
Alors t'appelles ton mec et tu lui dis !
Ça va, oh ! C'est à moi que tu causes ?
- Je t'ai dit de chercher, alors tu cherches !
- Cool, les mecs.
Ça va. Ça va, cool.
Putain, vous pouvez pas la fermer un peu ?
Mais, putain, c'est quoi cette merde ?
Je trouve que c'est un peu long.
Mais, putain, qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Elle est où, merde ?
Elle est où ?
- Rien dans cette section, non plus.
- Oui, ben alors, passez à la suivante.
Lieutenant, ces deux sacs,
ils peuvent être absolument n'importe où.
Exact.
- On pourrait bien y passer la nuit.
- Encore exact.
Alors on est en heures sup,
hein, c'est d'accord ?
S. Greggs - Contrôle des Saisies
Brigade des Stupéfiants
Erreur de syntaxe.
Je me ferai jamais à ce clavier, moi.
Putain de Blancs.
Tu t'imagines pas ce que je les aime !
- Ah oui ?
- Cons comme des balais, les mecs, je te jure.
- Qui ?
- Tous, ils sont tous cons.
Mais dans l'affaire Kane Street,
ça va être dur de les battre.
Je les appelle et je leur baratine
que je veux de la drogue,
tu sais ce qu'ils disent ?
Ils disent : "Je vais te vendre de la drogue.
Combien t'en veux ?"
Ils ont rien, aucun code.
Ils demandent même pas à te voir, que dalle.
Et quand tu passes à l'action, ben,
pas de lézard, tout le monde est cool.
Le gars te rencontre dans un parking
en disant :
"J'ai apporté la drogue,
vous avez pensé à notre blé ?"
Non, sans déconner, j'ai beaucoup plus
de respect pour les Blacks
depuis que je suis avec des Blancs
depuis 15 jours.
Si jamais les Blancs veulent vendre de la
drogue à Baltimore, faudra changer la loi.
Juste leur donner un petit coup de pouce.
- C'est une noble attention.
- Faut bien préserver l'homme blanc.
- S'il te plaît, Herc, qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
- Je veux que tu lances une saisie.
Et t'as un dossier ? Un rapport d'enquête ?
Qu'est-ce que tu peux me donner ?
Je croyais que tu faisais ça,
tu bosses aux saisies, non ?
Je centralise les dossiers.
Je fais le compte-rendu pour l'avoué.
Mais c'est à toi de me fournir
la documentation nécessaire.
Putain, c'est nase, votre truc.
Tu veux obtenir un mandat,
tu bosses la paperasse.
Faut que tu changes de cap, maintenant.
Tu peux plus te reposer sur Carver, sur moi.
Ah non ?
Tu veux venir, on a une descente, demain ?
On va se faire des adresses,
comme dans le temps.
Vous faites une descente ?
Ouais, deux maisons
et un bar sur Kane Street.
Allez, viens, Kima. Je sais que t'en meurs
d'envie. Je sais que ça te manque.
J'ai plus rien d'un chat de gouttière.
Une femme d'intérieur, voilà ce que je suis.
- Les ordis, tout ça, c'est cool, hein ?
- J'ai fait une promesse.
Je vais te dire un truc, Kima.
Si t'étais un garçon,
et sans tenir compte du fait que t'es
meilleure que les trois quarts des mecs,
tes potes te paieraient une bière
et ils t'expliqueraient.
- Et ils m'expliqueraient quoi ?
- Que t'es tombée au fond d'un piège.
- Au fond d'un piège ?
- Par une gonzesse qui va te saccager la vie.
C'est tout ce que j'ai à dire.
Alors...
Alors, quoi ?
Alors, où est-ce qu'il est, Omar ?
Qui ?
- Il a dit autre chose ?
- Non.
Juste de rappliquer. Tous et tout de suite.
Comment il a dit ça ?
Ben, il l'a dit, quoi. C'est tout, il l'a dit.
- Putain.
- Ouais.
Havre de Grace 5 km - Baltimore 64 km
Merde.
- Ça tient toujours la route ?
- Jusque-là.
J'y vais.
Ils étaient à l'heure juste ?
Le kilométrage ?
OK.
Je te repose encore une fois la question.
- Tu ne l'as jamais vu sortir de la voiture ?
- Non.
- Tu es bien resté avec lui tout le temps ?
- Je l'ai pas lâché une seconde.
Ça a pris combien de temps
pour qu'il sorte du garage ?
- Combien de temps il est resté tout seul ?
- Pas assez longtemps pour foutre la merde.
Je sais pas, un truc comme trois minutes.
Cool, cool.
- Ça coince, Bodie.
- Oui, je sais. Je t'assure, j'y suis...
T'as suivi l'itinéraire ?
- Oui, exactement comme...
- T'as relevé le kilométrage ?
- Oui, j'ai...
- Fais-moi voir.
Tu vois, j'ai tout noté.
Non, t'as fait 500 m de trop, là. Ça colle pas.
Si t'avais suivi l'itinéraire exact,
ce serait pas le cas.
Je te jure, String, j'ai tout fait
comme on avait dit, faut que tu me croies.
T'as une solution ?
T'aurais pas juste fait un détour à Camden,
là où il y a des travaux en ce moment ?
Non, ça te rappelle rien ?
Ton pied, il te fait mal ?
- Mon pied ?
- Quand t'as shooté dans le cric.
- Pendant tout le truc, t'étais derrière moi ?
- Qui, moi ?
Putain, c'est pas vrai, tu m'as fait suivre ?
Ouais, mais où on va, là ? Hé ?
ALIMENTS GRILLÉS - PRODUITS DE
CONSOMMATION COURANTE
Pourquoi tu m'emmènes pas avec toi ?
Faudrait que je les rencontre, ces types.
Si jamais je les rencontrais,
peut-être bien qu'on aurait une idée pour
faire du business, tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
- Zig, ces gars, c'est des vrais.
- Quoi, je suis pas un vrai, peut-être ?
Dehors, il devait faire six degrés.
Tout le monde rentre bouffer
et voir le père Noël,
mais nous, on prend le sens inverse.
Et Little Big Roy, avec sa jambe de bois.
Il est fou.
- Tu te souviens les pelles en bois ?
- Tu parles.
Ça te dit rien à toi, gamin, les pelles en bois,
t'as pas connu ça, toi ?
Pour pas faire d'étincelles avec le grain.
- Ou boum !
- Ah, ça ! Ça prend feu et ça pète !
On est pas prêts d'en revoir, des bateaux
à grains à Baltimore. C'est fini, ça.
Non, mais vous en avez pas marre,
les dinosaures ?
Vous en avez pas assez de raconter
comment on faisait avec une pelle en bois ?
Ça va, on sait que vous pouviez
soulever un train entier d'un seul bras.
Et que vous buviez vote whisky
avec un tuyau d'arrosage.
Et que vous alliez tringler jusqu'au petit-déj.
C'étaient des héros.
Ouais, ils astiquaient,
et fallait voir comment.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Cette génération, elle sait rien.
- Non, ce sera plus jamais comme avant.
- Non, c'est fini. Fini.
Avec vous, toutes les nuits,
on est en 1952, vous faites chier !
Hé, gamins ! Quand j'avais votre âge,
je déchargeais dix bateaux chaque jour, moi.
En plus, je devais le faire avec un seul bras,
parce qu'un sac de vibromasseurs polonais
de dix tonnes m'était tombé dessus !
Hé, Zig ! Viens voir.
C'est quoi un vibromasseur polonais ?
Ça ressemble à ça,
en nettement plus petit, quoi.
Ça y est, c'est la crise, on le tient plus, là !
Pourquoi tu la sors pas ? Fais voir la bête !
Si on devait comparer avec une saucisse,
il faudrait ça de pain pour faire un sandwich.
Normalement, dans trois minutes,
ce taré nous sort sa bite.
Ce garçon est cinglé !
Ouais, ouais, c'était moi
et ma vieille jambe de bois
et ma vieille pelle en bois
et mon oeil en verre,
et mon crayon polonais.
Comme si les contrôleurs avaient utilisé
autre chose que des vrais crayons !
Merde, maintenant, un crayon,
ils savent même plus comment s'en servir !
Ça y est, vous racontez vos conneries
d'avant guerre, maintenant ?
Au nom du Seigneur Jésus-Christ, écoutez !
Allez, les gars, tous à tribord !
Vite ! On se dépêche ! Allez ! Oh !
Le vieux rafiot donne de la bande !
Dites, vous le sentez pas, les gars ?
Vous voulez savoir pourquoi ?
Parce que cette bande de vieux cons,
ils ont déchargé tellement de conneries
que c'est toute cette putain de vieille taule
qui va chavirer.
Quel con ! Tenez bon !
On est en train de couler !
Il est vraiment malade, hein ?
Je te préviens, Ziggy, tu nous sors pas
ta queue, on l'a assez vue !
Je vais vous faire voir une petite cargaison
que vous ne pourrez pas décharger.
Qui a dit qu'on les faisait
plus comme avant ?
Super beau gosse est dans la ville !
Du pur Ziggy, mec !
- Je la monte sur le bateau ?
- Non, surtout pas !
- Elle tombera en morceaux, si tu fais ça.
- Je fais comment, alors ?
On va bien l'accrocher, et on la remorque
en douceur jusqu'au quai.
- De quoi elle a l'air ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
- Il y a longtemps qu'elle est là, d'après toi ?
- Non, elle est fraîche.
- Mais elle a les jambes cassées.
- Elle a sûrement sauté du pont.
Arrête, maman, merde !
La cuisine est fermée.
Pas de service pour les alcoolos incapables
de se lever pour attraper un bateau.
Quel bateau ?
Ton père a dit que le Talco Line
arrivait aujourd'hui.
Ça fait deux bateaux à North Point.
C'est l'Atlantic Light.
Il sera pas là avant cet après-midi.
Et alors, tu crois que c'est une excuse ?
Bonjour, maman.
Je suis bien, moi,
avec cette paire d'alcooliques !
Et surtout, ne t'en va pas
sans embarquer ton cousin avec toi !
Je dois faire le ménage, et je n'ai pas envie
de slalomer autour de sa carcasse.
Oh, tiens !
Vous, vous aimez faire des surprises, Stan.
On ne vous voit pas
à la messe du dimanche,
mais tôt le mardi,
vous débarquez avec une armée complète.
Tenez, deux mille cinq cents.
De ma part et de celle de tous les Polaks
de quatre casernes de pompiers
et de trois districts.
- À quoi devons-nous une telle générosité ?
- Une surprise.
Nous avons fait faire un vitrail
pour la partie de la nef qui a été rénovée.
Un vitrail commémoratif. Donnez-moi ça.
Voilà. Aux policiers
et aux pompiers polonais.
On a réussi à trouver un artisan à Glen
Burnie qui est vraiment incroyable.
- Pour la nef ?
- Oui, pour la nef.
Nous, nous aurions besoin d'un autre
vitrail, au deuxième étage du presbytère.
- Le presbytère ?
- Dans le grand couloir du haut.
Combien les dockers vous ont offert
pour cet emplacement ?
- Je vous offre plus.
- Le montant des dons est confidentiel.
- Comme vous le voyez, nous avons déjà...
- Je peux aller jusque à quatre mille dollars.
Dites-moi s'ils ont dépassé
les quatre mille, c'est tout.
Plus de quatre mille. De la part des docks.
Nom de Dieu, où ils...
Pardon, mon père.
- Qui est venu vous apporter ce don ?
- Francis Sobotka.
Frank Sobotka avec une somme pareille ?
- Lui et les hommes de sa section.
- Les contrôleurs ?
Il n'y en a pas cent
qui payent leur cotisation.
Les gens de cette paroisse sont généreux.
Vous pourriez peut-être voir Frank.
Essayez de vous entendre avec lui.
Oui, bien sûr. Nous allons discuter.
Ma... Major ?

Tiens, tiens, tiens.
Mais c'est notre Bill Bernacle le marin !
Salut, Ray, ça va ?
J'ai que des coups de crayon rouge
sous mon nom, cette année.
Landsman était déjà un trou du cul
et il est devenu hargneux.
- C'est elle, votre poisson ?
- Une suicidée, certainement.
- Ben, ouais, elle flottait sous le pont, quoi.
- Sûrement une suicidée, ouais.
- Mais jolie.
- C'est vrai, ouais.
J'étais aux toilettes, ce matin,
et devine qui crachait sa bile
dans la cuvette de à côté ?
Bunk Moreland.
- Comment tu le sais ?
- Ce gros cochon tient pas l'alcool.
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- Tout va bien.
Cool. OK.
- T'as pas eu de nouvelles de Roberto ?
- Non, aucune. Silence complet, mon frère.
C'est vrai ? Il a eu notre fric, pourtant, non ?
Alors va falloir que tu descendes à New York.
Il cherche à nous entuber, ou quoi,
ce connard ? T'es sûr de nos gars ?
J'ai vérifié leur histoire, ils sont clean.
Pas de lézard.
J'avais des types de confiance
qui les suivaient, en plus.
- Ah ouais ? Qui ça ?
- Tank, Country.
- Il est rentré depuis quand, cet enfoiré ?
- Un mois.
Il est en liberté surveillée, mais il s'en fout,
il a repris direct le business.
D'accord.
Alors, nous on a assuré, c'est à Roberto
de régler cette affaire, tu vois ?
Donc, quand tu verras le mec, sois cool,
mais quand même ferme.
Ils ont notre fric et on n'a pas le produit.
Enfin, tu comprends, il y a un truc qui cloche.
Et sinon, ici, ça se passe comment ?
C'est toujours pareil, mec. Enfin, tu vois.
Quand tu es là, tu deviens patient,
c'est tout.
Tu te dis qu'il n'y a que deux jours.
Celui où tu te retrouves dans ce trou.
- Et le jour où tu sors de ce putain de trou.
- Ouais.
Ouais, exact.
- Salut.
- Ça va ?
- Tu viens du bureau d'embauche ?
- Ouais. Je serai sur l'Atlantic Light.
- Ça donne quoi au local 47 ?
- T'auras pas tes chances.
Pour un roulier,
faut avoir au moins le niveau G.
Le mieux que tu te trouveras,
c'est une demi-journée de travail
sur un chargement d'aluminium en vrac
à Locust Point.
- Une demi-journée ?
- Et ouais, l'ancienneté, ça craint.
- Quand t'as pas l'ancienneté, ça fait chier.
- Tout juste.
- Je me casse, salut.
- Ouais, salut.
- Pourquoi tu m'as pas réveillé ?
- Tu viens de te lever, face de rat ?
Non, en fait, ta mère m'a fait
un super petit-déjeuner.
- Non, tu déconnes ?
- Avec du bacon et tout, mon chou.
Tu vas où, là ? Tu vas voir le Grec ?
Allez, se te plaît, quoi !
Je te ferai pas foirer ton plan, ça va.
Vas-y, t'attends quoi, là ?
Monte dans la voiture.
Bouge-toi ! On y va !
Je te préviens, Ziggy,
si jamais tu l'ouvres, je te tue.
- Nicky, le docker !
- Spiros.
Ça va, toi ?
- Bien. Ton ami, qui est-ce ?
- Oh, c'est Ziggy, le fils de mon oncle.
- Ton oncle ? Frankie ?
- Ouais.
Ziggy est son fils aîné.
Ma voiture est en rade, il m'a amené.
Alors, vous devez être le Grec.
Eh non. Mais enfin, je suis grec.
Hé ! Boris ! Boris Badanoff,
je te connais, toi ! T'es du coin !
Et pourquoi je serais Boris ?
D'où vous sortez cette idée ?
Où que j'aille, je suis Boris.
- Merde, t'es Russe, c'est logique.
- Non, Ukrainien. Kiev est en Ukraine.
- Ça revient au même, non ?
- Non, pas du tout, tu as tort.
Qu'est-ce que ça peut te faire,
t'aimes pas qu'on t'appelle Boris ?
Sergeï.
Arrête, tu rigoles ! Boris, c'est bien mieux !
Tu sais, comme le mec du dessin animé.
Boris et Natasha ?
Boris Badanoff, Natasha Fatale,
Rocky et Bullwinkle !
- Tu veux un café ? De la tarte ?
- Non, ça va, merci.
- Attendez, elle est à quoi, la tarte ?
- Hé, Zig.
Tu te la fermes, compris ?
Il déconne, lui.
Non, il est cool. C'est rien.
- C'est le fils de Frank, tu dis ?
- Ouais.
Il est au syndicat, vous savez.
Mais il est "série L",
alors il travaille que dalle.
- Même contrat, même tarif.
- D'accord. Qui doit conduire ?
Encore ?
Vous devriez changer plus souvent.
Faut éviter que les douaniers
mettent des noms sur les visages.
Si tu fais confiance à un mec,
t'en changes pas.
- Entendu.
- Très bien.
Boris, c'est ça ?
- Sergeï.
- Ouais, si tu veux.
Tu te bouges, tronche de cake ?
- Hé, elle est comment votre dinde grillée ?
- Fais chier, on s'en va.
À bientôt, les gars.
- Bullwinkle ?
- C'est un Polak.
Tu m'as fait passer pour un con, là-dedans !
Mais non, Ziggy, t'as eu besoin de personne.
Vous avez pas vu mon neveu dans le coin ?
Qui, Nick ? Non, pas encore.
Je crois qu'il a aucune heure, aujourd'hui.
- Salut, Frank.
- Salut, ma jolie.
Pour que je finisse mon rapport vite fait,
vous allez voler quoi, aujourd'hui ?
J'en sais rien.
Deux bagnoles de luxe et une petite série
de téléviseurs, écrans plats.
Ou bien, quelques caisses de vodka,
ou peut-être un cargo entier, je sais pas.
D'accord, c'est noté. Bonne journée, alors.
Dis donc, tu la laisses déconner là-dessus ?
Oui. Elle est sympa. Je l'aime bien.
J'ai consulté l'ordinateur, c'est zone neuf,
cellule onze. Tout au fond.
- Toi, tu bosses sur le Light ?
- Je suis dessus, ouais.
- Ouais. Ils t'ont dit autre chose ?
- Non. Juste que ce serait le même tarif.
On s'en va.
À plus, oncle Frank.
- Winona.
- Jimmy ! Mais t'étais où ?
Regarde qui est là ! C'est notre marin !
- Tu me dois dix dollars.
- Tu rêves.
Tu as dit à Rawls où je ne voulais pas aller.
C'est toi qui m'as planté.
- Je lui ai dit ça. Et alors ?
- C'est là qu'il m'a envoyé.
Je savais qu'il était furax,
je savais pas à quel point.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux que je te dise ?
- Où est Bunk ?
- Il est en intervention avec Crutchfield.
T'en es où avec la fille ?
Elle était bien tombée du pont ?
Frazier l'a autopsiée aujourd'hui. Résultat :
traumatisme à la poitrine et au crâne.
Il dit qu'elle était déjà morte
avant de toucher l'eau.
Et les blessures faites en se défendant ?
Des contusions sur trois doigts.
On les avait vues en la repêchant.
T'as loupé les traces de défense ?
J'en cherchais pas.
Je pensais qu'elle était tombée du pont, moi.
Elle est dans la flotte,
sans manteau ni chaussures.
Le courant a pu arracher ses affaires,
mais c'est pas sûr.
Et je la vois pas venir jusqu'au Key Bridge,
en plein hiver, habillée comme elle était.
Mais c'est que mon avis à moi.
Vous direz à Bunk que je suis passé.
Amusez-vous bien !
Ça y est, on l'a eue, notre rigolade.
On l'a balancée au Comté, la nana !
Le Comté ?
Vous l'avez trouvée à l'est du pont, non ?
Ça dépend bien du Comté. Elle est à eux.
- Tu leur as fait gober ça ?
- Moi non, Rawls !
Il a téléphoné au colonel, et il lui a dit :
"Vous avez un sacré meurtre à résoudre, là."
C'est ça, l'instinct de conservation, Jimmy.
Un instinct que t'as jamais eu.
Hé, Norris. La police d'État, ligne deux !
Descends-le ! Un peu plus à droite !
Bien ! Bien ! Continue !
Eh voilà, c'est quand ils veulent.
VITESSE LIMITÉE À 25 KM/H SUR LE PONT
Maintenant que je suis votre avocat,
monsieur Bell,
nous sommes protégés
par la clause de confidentialité.
- Je pensais que Roberto serait là.
- Hé, non, c'était peu probable.
Ceci était malheureusement
dans le journal de lundi.
Apparemment, Roberto Castellano y Silva
est devenu une des cibles de la DEA.
C'est pour ça
qu'on n'a pas fait affaire, alors.
Pour le moment, Roberto et ses hommes
refusent de s'engager dans quoi que ce soit
qui risquerait de compliquer la situation.
Vous savez, en règle générale, quand on
s'est fait coincer, on reprend aussi sec,
- car plus personne ne vous regarde.
- C'est le cas, parfois.
Et parfois aussi, on se demande pour quelle
raison exacte on s'est fait attraper.
Et on décide de changer son mode d'action.
Notre argent, il l'a pris ?
Votre avance et nos petits soucis
sont arrivés en même temps.
Toutefois, on m'a dit que votre argent
était reparti pour Baltimore.
J'ai l'impression très nette
que vous nous reprochez à nous
la situation malheureuse de Roberto.
Peut-être que vos problèmes à Baltimore
et que ceux de mon client, ici,
ne sont pas liés,
qu'il s'agit d'une coïncidence.
- Mais pour l'instant...
- Écoutez-moi.
Il a été le premier à savoir
que nous étions atteints.
Et il sait que tout le monde a joué
le jeu sans hésiter.
Je lui ai envoyé tous les documents
sur l'affaire.
Quoi qu'il en soit, notre inquiétude
est légitime, je crois.
Étant donné l'envergure des opérations
menées par Monsieur Barksdale,
sa condamnation est, disons-le, modérée.
Et si, aussi improbable
que cela puisse paraître, la légèreté
de sa condamnation
était la contrepartie d'une coopération...
Enfin, vous comprenez notre position,
j'en suis sûr.
Frank, c'est toujours là, dehors,
avec ce Russe qui se décide pas
à l'enlever du quai !
Je ne suis pas aveugle.
J'aime pas que ça reste à découvert
aussi longtemps !
Les plombs de la douane sont brisés,
quelqu'un va le voir.
Hé, c'est notre peau qui est en jeu, là !
Nick, c'est quoi, ce bordel ?
Il est encore là.
- C'est vrai ?
- Ouais.
- Où est Sergeï ?
- Il est garé de l'autre côté de la zone.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il attend ?
- Je ne sais pas ce qu'il attend !
Mais le cargo est pratiquement vide.
Faut qu'ils se décident vite à le prendre.
- Je vais voir ce qui se passe.
- Ouais.
D'accord, c'est entendu.
Fais chier. Prends un tracteur et va me le
caser dans la réserve. Ça craint trop, là.
MARTIN DE BALTIMORE - Maryland
Ville de Baltimore
Je te mens pas quand je te dis que
ce boulot à remplir des dossiers m'abrutit.
Peut-être, mais, au moins, quand tu rentres
en fin de journée, tu es entière.
C'est ce que tu crois et ça t'arrange.
Mais à force de me blesser avec le papier
et les agrafes, je vais être handicapée.
La vilaine super flic qui fait la tête !
Viens par là, je vais faire
un gros bisou sur tes petits bobos !
- Tout ça ?
- Je commence et ça risque de durer.
Mille dollars pour le docteur ?
Mille dollars tous les mois, chérie.
Jusque à ce que je sois enceinte.
Il y a sûrement un moyen.
Dans ce cas, c'est à toi de jouer, cocotte.
Si tu veux économiser de l'argent,
trouve-moi le donneur adéquat.
Même si tu me prêtais ta chatte, je refuserais
de coucher avec un de ces gars.
Qu'est-ce que tu dis ? Qu'est-ce que tu dis ?
Tu vas voir ! Attends, viens par là !
FAX - MESSAGE AU :
COMTE DE BALTIMORE - CRIMINELLE
NOMBRE DE PAGES : 7
Commandant William A. Rawls - Criminelle
Sergent !
Votre noyée est revenue !
Les gars du Comté estiment
qu'elle est de notre côté du pont.
- Merde, alors ! C'est vrai ?
- Ouais.
Un connard de notre unité maritime
leur a faxé un rapport sur les marées
matinales et les directions du vent.
Données qui montrent que le corps
est tombé à l'ouest du pont et qu'il a dérivé.
McNulty.
Ce connard de Jimmy.
Il nous fait chier juste pour le plaisir.
Je dois reconnaître que ce salaud,
il a fait preuve d'esprit, sur ce coup.
- Le sale enculé.
- Le fils de pute.
Le compte est bon. On en est où ?
Mace en a 10 avec lui, ici,
et Moe Man en a environ 38, je pense.
J'ai vérifié le stock. On est presque à sec.
- Moe Man nous tire des trucs.
- Il en est où ?
Il dit qu'il en a 30 quelque chose.
Mais je suis sûr que c'est faux !
Je vais me le faire, ce mec, moi !
La seule idée qui te vient,
c'est de cogner, mec.
Tu comprendras quand que dans le business,
c'est pas le tout de tabasser des nègres ?
- Combien Moe Man devrait en avoir ?
- Trente-huit, en gros.
- Tu vois ? T'as déliré.
- N'empêche qu'on est légers.
Écoute, si on n'a pas grand-chose,
c'est que String l'a décidé comme ça.
D'accord ? S'il veut qu'on en ait plus,
il nous donne. String, il gère ce business.
C'est le chef pour tout.
Retourne à ton poste, bouge !
Enfoiré de McNulty.
Le Prince des Marées.
MARYLAND - POLICE DES TRANSPORTS
- Hé, tu te sens en forme, aujourd'hui ?
- Ouais.
Essaie de lui décoller le cul de ce fauteuil.
T'es trop con ! Il a dit que si tu voulais
le frapper, tu pouvais aussi.
Tu sais ce que fait un type du 47
après avoir tiré un coup ?
- Non, quoi ?
- Il essuie le lacrymo qu'il a sur la figure.
Hé, Frank ! Frank. Il se passe quelque chose.
- Il y avait des filles, là-dedans, des jeunes.
- Ils disent qu'elles sont une douzaine.
Mortes ? Elles sont mortes ?
Treize corps, toutes des femmes.
Onze Blanches et deux de type asiatique.
Elles avaient entre vingt et trente ans.
Toutes complŤtement mortes.
Originaires d'Europe de l'Est, sans doute.
Alors, il s'agit de quoi ? Un accident ?
Le tuyau d'aťration du haut a ťtť ťcrasť.
SŻrement pendant le dťchargement.
Alors, oui accident, probablement.
Mais c'est ŗ lui de le dire. Pas vrai ?
- Docteur ?
- Frazier.
Enchantťe. Alors, comment on fait ?
- Comment on fait ?
- Je veux dire qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
Comment on procŤde, avec tout Áa ?
C'est votre premiŤre enquÍte
avec des morts, officier ?
Russell. La premiŤre et l'unique.
Vous en avez treize pour le prix d'un.
On va commencer les autopsies
cet aprŤs-midi.
Tout ce que vous trouverez sur leur identitť
devra Ítre envoyť ŗ mon bureau.
Leur identitť ?
Jusque-lŗ, on a trouvť aucun passeport,
aucun visa pour tout le lot.
Tout ce que vous trouverez
dans leurs bagages, vous me l'envoyez,
ou elles arriveront sur la table de dissection
en tant que Jane Doe.
Qui est en charge de l'enquÍte ?
Vivantes, elles seraient des clandestines
et elles seraient pour l'immigration.
- Mortes, c'est du cargo.
- Du cargo, pas de la contrebande.
Il n'y a aucune violation de la loi
pour les douanes.
Une propriťtť des Autoritťs portuaires ?
ņ l'…tat de s'en charger.
Ce sera vite vu.
Si c'est accidentel,
le travail revient ŗ identifier ces clandestins.
«a me convient trŤs bien.
D'aprŤs ce que j'ai vu, il n'y a aucune raison
d'ouvrir une vraie enquÍte.
Attendez.
La Crim laisse aussi filer cette affaire ?
Pas de crime, pas d'enquÍte.
Tout ce que vous avez ŗ rťgler ici, Russell,
c'est un tas de paperasserie.
Et il n'en resta plus qu'un.
SUR …COUTE
"Ils te m‚chent, mais ils sont obligťs
de te recracher." - McNulty
- T'ťtais pas obligť de le voir.
- Non ?
Non, tout ce que tu vas dire,
je l'ai dťjŗ dit ŗ Spiros.
Tu lui as dit
que c'ťtait un gros connard de grec ?
Tu crois que c'est ce qu'on voulait ?
Alors lŗ, je sais pas ce que vous voulez
ou vous voulez pas.
J'avais un conteneur plein de femmes
en train de mourir d'asphyxie sur mes quais.
- C'ťtait une erreur.
- Une erreur ?
Elles ont crevť dans ce conteneur,
alors que ce dťbile ťtait plantť lŗ tranquille,
ŗ rien foutre !
Tu sais rien, toi.
Nous comprenons que tu sois en colŤre,
Frank. Nous sommes en colŤre aussi.
Sergei devrait attendre que notre ami
descende du bateau. D'accord ?
Cet ami devait nous garantir
qu'il n'y avait aucun problŤme.
Tu sais, avec la douane.
- Il n'est pas descendu du bateau.
- Putain, pourquoi ?
Ca, c'est ce qu'on veut dťcouvrir,
on n'en sait rien.
Parce que vous avez pas le bon message,
ces filles crŤvent sur mes quais ?
«a fonctionne comme Áa ?
C'est sur mes quais que Áa s'est passť !
Je comprends ce que tu ressens.
On est aussi en colŤre.
Tout le monde l'est, tout le monde.
Personne ne voulait Áa.
Oncle Frank,
ils disent que ce n'ťtait pas volontaire.
Vous auriez pu me dire qu'il y avait des filles
dans ce conteneur.
Si vous me l'aviez dit,
je l'aurais pas rangť comme Áa
dans un coin de la rťserve, tu vois ?
Pourquoi vous m'avez pas dit
ce qu'il y avait dedans ?
Tu veux savoir
ce qu'il y a dans les conteneurs ?
Avant, tu voulais pas savoir
et maintenant tu veux qu'on te le dise.
Des flingues, tu vois ?
De la drogue, des filles,
de la vodka, des BMW,
du caviar de bťluga, ou des bombes,
peut-Ítre bien.
De vilains terroristes
avec plein de grosses bombes.
Je rigole, Frank, c'est une blague.
Mais tu demandes rien
parce que tu veux rien savoir.
Dis au Grec que s'il reÁoit encore
des choses qui respirent
dans un de ces conteneurs,
faudra que je sois averti.
«a ira un peu mieux dans un jour ou deux.
Alors Roberto a ťtť arrÍtť ?
Par la DEA. Ils l'ont eu ŗ New York.
Dans ce cas, Áa explique son silence.
L'argent pour la derniŤre transaction
est revenu. Dans sa totalitť.
Merde. Ils veulent plus traiter avec nous ?
Les Dominicains ont peur
et font comme si c'ťtait nous le problŤme.
Roberto refuse de nous voir.
Stringer n'a vu que son avocat.
Ils disent qu'ils veulent des garanties
avant de reprendre les affaires avec nous.
- Ils ont dit que t'avais que sept ans ŗ faire...
- Ils croient que je suis un traÓtre ?
Ce sont que des sous-entendus.
En fait, ils savent pas comment les fťdťraux
ont eu Roberto.
Du coup on est hors circuit ?
…coute,
dans les citťs,
on a du mal ŗ s'en sortir avec ce qu'on a.
Avon, faut que tu trouves vite quelqu'un.
J'ai un ami ŗ Atlanta.
Il vend des lunettes. Il s'appelle Vargus.
Dis ŗ String de prendre l'avion demain
pour aller lui parler.
T'as vu D'Angelo ces derniers jours ?
Il est ŗ l'ťtage J.
Franchement, c'est pas facile pour moi
d'aller ŗ cet ťtage. Tu comprends ?
Tu le laisses livrť ŗ lui-mÍme.
Et Donette fait n'importe quoi.
- Je ne sais plus quoi faire.
- Et Donette ?
Je laisse des messages, elle rappelle jamais.
C'est pas souvent non plus
qu'elle vient s'asseoir ici.
Il faut qu'on lui serre la vis vraiment, Avon.
Elle devrait lui amener son fils
chaque semaine.
D'accord, j'en parlerai aussi ŗ String.
…tant donnť ce qu'il encaisse
pour nous tous,
il faut s'occuper D'Angelo et le soutenir.
- Des promesses ont ťtť faites.
- Je sais.
Ils lui ont collť vingt ans.
Et tu l'entends pas r‚ler.
Il porte un sacrť fardeau pour sa famille.
Et on s'occupe bien de lui.
Dee est plutŰt froid avec moi, tu vois.
Il essaie de s'adapter.
De s'adapter ?
Brianna,
je laisserai jamais rien de mal lui arriver,
tu le sais bien, non ?
SALLE D'ENTRETIEN 1
- C'est toi qui les as pÍchťs ?
- Pas en hiver.
Mais dans deux petits mois.
Avantage en nature.
Pouvez pas pÍcher le crabe ŗ la criminelle.
ņ part une infirmiŤre
au service des urgences,
de temps en temps.
- Fait un peu chaud ici.
- Non, non, laisse, n'ouvre pas.
«a va Ítre la zone si Rawls passe et me voit.
T'es pas un petit trou du cul ordinaire,
Jimmy ?
- T'es un modŤle trŤs spťcial.
- Je suis spťcial.
En combien de temps t'as trouvť
que les courants
l'avaient entraÓnťe au-delŗ du comtť ?
- Trois heures.
- Trois heures...
Trois heures avec ta table des marťes
et ta petite carte du port rien que pour coller
ŗ Rawls un macchabťe de plus.
Et Áa te fait marrer que ce soit Cole qui,
du coup, hťrite de cette affaire ŗ la noix ?
Ce sont les dommages collatťraux.
Tes branchies, tu les veux pas ?
Et en plus t'es une chochotte.
- Il nous faut Omar, Jimmy.
- T'as vu Áa ?
- Treize filles ?
- Oui, j'en ai entendu parler.
- Qui enquÍte ?
- C'est pas nous.
Patapsco, c'est la juridiction
de la police portuaire.
De toute faÁon, ce sera pas classť
comme meurtre. Alors, on s'en fout.
…coute, s'il te plaÓt. Je n'ai rien contre Bird,
sauf si ce tarť de fils de pute d'Omar
vient tťmoigner. Tu comprends ?
Alors montre-moi un peu ta gratitude.
Si tu veux de la gratitude,
viens t'asseoir sur mes genoux.
I.B.S. - PAS DE REL¬CHE
Et lŗ ce con s'approche et il me dit
que les scellťs ont ťtť brisťs
et que je suis responsable.
Non mais t'y crois, toi ?
J'ai vu le conteneur sur la grue
et les scellťs ťtaient dťjŗ cassťs. Je te jure.
Qui l'a fait, alors ?
L'ťquipage, sŻrement. C'est sŻrement
le coup d'un de ces foutus marins.
- Il y avait quoi dedans ?
- De la vodka, enfin, je pense.
Nous, on a peut-Ítre tirť
une caisse ou deux,
mais merde, Frank,
le conteneur ťtait dťjŗ ouvert !
C'est bon, Tommy, tes bobards,
tu te les gardes.
Je te le jure, Frank, nous,
on s'est mis de cŰtť deux caisses au final.
Et on s'est servis aprŤs que tous les mecs
de l'ťquipe aient pris leur part.
- Seulement deux caisses ?
- On en a tirť quatre.
- C'est quoi ce boxon avec la police ?
- Quoi ?
Y sont lŗ ŗ coller des amendes
sur toutes les voitures.
"Plaque arriŤre en partie illisible ?"
Le crochet de remorque est placť trop haut.
"Obstruction de l'accŤs de sťcuritť."
Vous vous foutez de moi ?
On se met le long de ce b‚timent
depuis que les voiliers ont des voiles.
«a rime ŗ quoi, Áa ? Rťpondez !
- J'y suis pour rien, c'est mon patron.
- C'est qui votre patron ?
- Valchek, district sud-est.
- Stan Valchek ?
Le commandant de district, oui.
Ce con ŗ la mords-moi le noeud !
Et pourquoi il nous emmerde ?
Il vous a dans son collimateur en tout cas,
Áa paraÓt sŻr et certain.
Ce matin, mon lieutenant
m'a transmis une consigne.
On doit passer deux fois par jour
ŗ votre syndicat et tapisser les voitures.
- Vous travaillez pour un trou du cul.
- Pour plusieurs, en fait.
On va pas se laisser faire,
et ŗ la ville ils vont nous entendre.
Allez voir le maire, je vous bl‚merai pas,
mais moi, j'ai rien dit.
C'est la hiťrarchie.
Je dois me le coltiner,
ce fils de pute, moi aussi.
- Tu peux pas dire que c'est mal rangť, mec.
- Tu parles que quand je t'y autorise !
QUEUE NOIRE
Qui t'a demandť de dťcorer, connard ?
C'est une cellule merdique Áa pour moi.
T'appelle Áa rangť, toi ?
- Merde, j'ai rien fait.
- T'arrÍtes de me parler comme Áa, connard !
T'as aussi des animaux ?
Non. Regarde, ils sont en plastique,
avec des petits moteurs et tout.
Nettoie-moi ce bordel
avant la fermeture des portes !
Et de quatre, les gars !
Attends-moi lŗ, j'en ai pas pour longtemps.
Tu veux quoi ?
Il est classť E et toi, t'es classť G.
S'il veut le bateau, il a le bateau.
Mais enfin, c'est l'anciennetť, Mims.
- Pas de syndicat sans Áa, mon frŤre.
- T'as ton chťri qui t'attend ŗ cŰtť.
Qui ?
Je te laisse, Mims. Dťsolť.
- C'est plutŰt vide ici.
- Tout le monde travaille.
- Vous avez pigť le message ?
- Le message ?
Je fais bosser des gens sur un vitrail
pour la nef de l'…glise Saint-Casimir,
vous le saviez, Áa ?
J'ai pris l'argent de personnes diffťrentes,
en leur disant bien ŗ quoi il devait servir.
- Vous l'avez dit au PŤre Lewandowski ?
- «a devait Ítre une surprise.
C'est rťussi, tout le monde est trŤs surpris.
On se retrouve avec un vitrail de trop.
Il y a peut-Ítre une solution. Le PŤre Lew dit
qu'un des vitraux pourrait Ítre installť
au presbytŤre. En haut, au second ťtage.
- Tant mieux pour vous.
- Tant mieux pour vous, Frank.
Si vous voulez pas que je m'occupe
de votre cas, faites ce qui est juste.
Ce qui est juste ?
Ce qui aurait ťtť juste,
c'est que vous soyez passť me voir ici
comme un honnÍte homme,
avec l'intention de me parler d'ťgal ŗ ťgal.
Mais c'est loin d'Ítre votre faÁon de faire.
Mon vieux m'a toujours dit
qu'enfant ŗ l'ťcole,
vous ťtiez dťjŗ un mťchant merdeux.
Et ma soeur a dit
que vous jouiez les chieurs ŗ chaque bal
quand il y avait pas de fille
qui s'intťressait ŗ vous.
Quand vous Ítes devenu Commandant,
presque tous dans le coin ont dit
que pour un dťnommť Valchek,
le badge d'agent, c'ťtait dťjŗ trop.
Et faut avouer que pas un jour
vous avez cessť d'Ítre un connard ŗ galons.
Allez vous faire voir ! Avec votre vitrail !
Oý est-ce que tu seras ?
Je serai en train de dťjeuner quelque part,
a priori.
Tu me donnes une heure, d'accord ?
- C'est quoi, ce truc-lŗ ?
- Un noeud.
T'as qu'ŗ faire des doubles noeuds,
tant que t'y es.
Qu'est-ce qu'on a d'autre ?
Mťdicaments, vÍtements,
matťriel de couchage et c'est tout.
- On a une lettre, quand mÍme.
- Une lettre ? Dans quelle langue ?
Va savoir.
Mais c'est encore avec l'alphabet tout tordu.
C'est du russe ou un truc dans le genre,
moi je te le dis.
J'arrive ŗ dťchiffrer ni le nom, ni l'adresse.
Sur le timbre, il y a ťcrit "Magyar",
en tout cas.
- C'est oý le Magyar ?
- J'ai une tÍte d'atlas ?
Salut. Lequel de vos enquÍteurs
est chargť des treize filles ?
Les enquÍteurs ?
Ils sont au bar ŗ cette heure-ci.
Vous en avez hťritť ?
Ils les ont classťes dans les accidents,
et nous ont refourguť la paperasserie.
C'est elle qui les a dťcouvertes.
ņ elle de gratter le papier.
- McNulty, Unitť Maritime de la ville.
- Bťatrice Russell.
- Vous les avez identifiťes ?
- On n'a ni visa, ni passeport.
On a quelques bouts de papier,
mais rien de trŤs parlant.
Presque tout est ťcrit avec l'alphabet russe.
«a vous intťresse, alors ?
Pourquoi ?
J'ai repÍchť une fille non identifiťe
avant-hier, prŤs du pont.
Et elle est pas dans les personnes
portťes disparues.
On a quatorze sacs de couchage
et treize mortes.
- Quand a eu lieu le meurtre ?
- Le meurtre ? Vous plaisantez ?
On a des photos, si Áa vous intťresse.
J'ai appelť la morgue ce matin.
Une chose :
le travail sur les dents n'est pas amťricain.
Europťen, sans doute.
- C'est votre fille ?
- Je crois que oui.
Elle est plus jolie lŗ-dessus.
Vous l'avez trouvťe dans l'eau avant-hier,
c'est Áa ? PrŤs du pont ?
ņ neuf heures,
en face du quai Fort Armistead.
Pourquoi vous auriez une fille assassinťe
dans l'eau
et les autres en train d'ťtouffer
dans un conteneur ?
- Qu'est-ce qui s'est passť ?
- Le tuyau d'aťration du dessus a ťtť ťcrasť.
C'est arrivť quand ils ont dťplacť
le conteneur. ņ priori.
Il ťtait rempli jusqu'au double fond,
situť ŗ sept mŤtres cinquante de l'entrťe.
Il y avait des cartons empilťs partout
avec un ťtroit passage menant
ŗ la petite porte dans la cloison.
Porte qui ne s'ouvre que de l'extťrieur.
- Elles ont fait tout le voyage lŗ-dedans ?
- ņ priori, non.
Une fois en mer,
il y a gťnťralement quelqu'un de l'ťquipage
qui se charge des clandestins,
vous savez, le passeur.
Il les fait sortir, leur donne ŗ manger,
les laisse se balader ou se laver.
Elles se sont agrippťes aux murs
en essayant de trouver de l'air.
C'est ce que le mťdecin lťgiste a dit,
en tout cas.
- Oý est l'aťration ?
- C'est ce trou. Le tuyau dťpasse dehors.
Vous avez beaucoup de clandestins ?
Un certain nombre. Ce sont les douanes
ou l'immigration qui les trouvent.
Surtout des Dominicains ou des HaÔtiens,
enfin, plutŰt de cette partie du globe.
- Pas nombreux ŗ venir d'Europe ?
- Un peu plus depuis le onze septembre.
On n'obtient plus aussi facilement un visa.
Et voilŗ.
En gťnťral,
si le passeur fait bien son boulot,
il place son conteneur
plutŰt au bas de la cargaison,
pour que les filles sortent
directement au niveau du sol de la cale.
Il ťtait oý celui-lŗ ?
- Regardez.
- Quoi ?
- «a vous paraÓt normal ?
- Comment Áa ?
Vous Ítes de l'Unitť Maritime, c'est Áa ?
Qu'est-ce que votre unitť a ŗ voir avec
treize filles asphyxiťes dans un conteneur ?
Rien du tout.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez, alors ?
Allez voir le PŤre Lew et demandez-lui
de rendre ŗ Sobotka son argent.
Et d'ťchanger les vitraux, par exemple.
Stash, vous avez dťjŗ vu un prÍtre
rendre de l'argent ?
Le gars paie pour un vitrail, il a son vitrail.
Je croyais que vous aviez vos entrťes.
Oui, j'en ai ŗ la mairie.
ņ Annapolis, j'en ai aussi.
Mais qui, mis ŗ part le Pape, a des pistons
avec le Cardinal ? Laissez tomber, Stash.
D'oý il le sort, ce fric, de toute faÁon ?
Excellente question.
Je sais pas, l'I.B.S. doit employer tout juste
mille cinq cents gars dans cette ville.
Et il n'y a pas plus de cent contrŰleurs.
Ils ont toujours quelques bateaux
qui passent.
Ce sont les rouliers
qui les maintiennent ŗ flots.
- C'est tout ce qu'ils ont ?
- ņ peu prŤs, oui.
Il y a six mois,
l'I.B.S. a engagť l'ťquipe de Bruce Dibiago
pour qu'elle intervienne ŗ Annapolis.
Et ils ont ťtť gťnťreux
avec les reprťsentants politiques.
Ils ont balancť un tas de fric.
- D'oý ils le sortaient ?
- Aucune idťe.
Mais Dibiago est un type trŤs cher, Stash.
Lŗ, on parle vraiment de gros sous.
Tu sais quoi ?
Je crois que Francis Sobotka
est dans des trucs pas nets.
C'est toi le flic. Pas moi, Stanouch.
La Grainerie ?
Alors ce sera Burrell,
le prochain prťfet de police ?
Oui, j'ai vu pire.
S'il avait ťtť ťcrasť par un autre conteneur,
il n'y aurait eu qu'une marque d'ťcrasement.
Ou deux, si le truc avait glissť
et ťtait revenu en place.
Lŗ, on dirait que quelqu'un a frappť dessus
ŗ plusieurs endroits.
Vous voyez ?
Avant de me prononcer, je prťfŤre
vťrifier la chose auprŤs d'un mťtallurgiste.
Mais oui, ŗ premiŤre vue,
vous venez d'hťriter de treize meurtres.
Fťlicitations.
Si le Prťfet s'en va ŗ Washington,
vous le remplacerez ?
Ca, c'est au Maire de le dťcider.
Et le conseil doit Ítre d'accord.
Mais si le Maire vous veut,
Áa devrait pas Ítre un gros problŤme.
Quand on reste dans le circuit aussi
longtemps que moi, on se fait des ennemis.
Qui donc ? Les gars du premier district ?
Ils ne feront rien, rien du tout.
- Ils soutiennent Shipley.
- C'est du racisme, vous voyez.
Je suis sincŤrement offensť par le fait
qu'une personne agisse en votre dťfaveur
pour favoriser l'ascension d'un colonel
simplement parce qu'il est blanc.
Vous savez ce que je vais faire ?
Je vais tťlťphoner ŗ mes amis de la Mairie.
Je leur toucherai un mot du premier district.
C'est trŤs gentil.
Et en attendant, que je puis-je faire
pour vous, commandant Valchek ?
C'est une excellente question.
J'ai besoin d'un dťtachement.
Des gars de la criminelle surtout, je pourrai
mettre des gars de mon district ťgalement.
Pour quoi faire ?
Il y a des types du secteur sud-est
qui semblent avoir beaucoup de fric.
- Des dockers, des gars du port.
- De l'I.B.S. ?
J'ai pas l'intention
de m'attaquer au syndicat tout entier.
Seulement ŗ un ou deux mecs
qui m'ont l'air pas nets.
Trafic de drogue peut-Ítre.
Ou les vols habituels.
- Frank Sobotka, vous le connaissez ?
- Non.
D'ailleurs, je pense que le problŤme
ne va pas plus loin que ce type.
- Dites-moi, il est quoi pour vous ?
- Pour moi ?
C'est un trou du cul.
Six hommes pour six semaines.
Choisis par Rawls.
Tu n'avais pas l'air d'avoir trŤs faim.
Il fait trŤs froid ce soir.
Cedric, je n'aurais pas dŻ en reparler,
je suis dťsolťe.
Tu as raison. Tu as toujours raison.
Tout ce que je dis,
c'est que tu dois Ítre rťaliste.
Tu as fait ce que tu as fait,
et aujourd'hui tu es lŗ oý tu es.
Au sous-sol.
Un peu plus et ils t'enterraient
sous les fondations du b‚timent.
Burrell ne sera pas toujours lŗ.
Burrell sera le prochain Prťfet de Police
et tu le sais.
…coute, tu as un diplŰme de droit.
Avec ton expťrience de policier, plein
de cabinets seraient honorťs de t'employer.
Tu as le choix, tu comprends ?
- Alors, peut-Ítre qu'ils t'ont mis...
- Tu as raison. Tu as raison.
Je vais prťparer mon dťpart.
- Qui veut son petit-dťj ?
- T'en as mis du temps !
Lucky ťtait fermť,
je suis allť au supermarchť.
Je pensais que Mutt travaillerait
ŗ North Point. Il aime bien les rouliers.
Mais sa femme se fait opťrer,
alors il a redonnť ses heures.
- Qui les a eues ?
- C'est New Charles qui remplace Mutt.
Tu travailles aujourd'hui ?
Non. Je viens seulement prendre le petit-dťj
avec vous, bande de bouffis !
Le repas le plus important
de la putain de journťe, hein ?
- Sers-le bien et vite, Dolores, Ziggy a soif.
- C'est vrai, j'ai soif.
Alors vous Ítes prÍts ? On se le boit
cul sec, celui-lŗ, les chochottes.
- Nick.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Viens par lŗ.
- Je crois que j'ai trouvť un bon plan.
- Ah oui ?
Tu connais White Mike
qui est ŗ Curtis Bay ?
- Il va me refiler un paquet.
- Un paquet ?
De la dope, de la dope.
Ziggy, je dois travailler aujourd'hui.
Et je vais me faire autant de blť sans
travailler. Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
- Alors pourquoi tu viens m'en parler ?
- Je voulais que tu t'associes avec moi.
Si tu me refiles du fric, le gars
pourrait me refiler un paquet plus gros.
On le refourgue, on est tous les deux payťs.
Messieurs, le bateau est arrivť.
- C'est nul ŗ chier ton truc.
- Au travail !
- Allez, dťconne pas, Nick.
- Tu m'emmŤnes ?
Nicky, tu peux y rťflťchir au moins.
Dolores, sers-moi un autre verre.
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- ContrŰle d'alcoolťmie.
Descendez de voiture
pour passer l'alcootest.
Mais il est huit heures !
Il est tout juste huit heures du matin.
Vous croyez que les gens
se bourrent la gueule ŗ huit heures du mat ?
Je ne discute pas le fait que techniquement,
la juridiction n'est pas la nŰtre.
Patapsco est une propriťtť des autoritťs
portuaires qui dťpend de la police portuaire.
- «a ne fait aucun doute.
- Bien.
Ils ne sont pas ťquipťs
pour ce genre d'enquÍte.
Leur fourguer les 13 corps,
c'est nous les fourguer ŗ nous.
La police d'…tat va devoir rťcupťrer
le g‚chis et on est dťjŗ dťbordťs.
Robbie. Je me suis battu bec et ongles
pendant quatre mois
pour que mon taux d'ťlucidation
dťpasse les 50 %.
ņ l'heure actuelle,
il atteint exactement 51,6 %.
Et vous savez
ce que sera mon taux d'ťlucidation
si je vous prends les treize cadavres ?
- Trente-neuf virgule quatre pour cent.
- Bill, je vous l'ai dťjŗ dit...
Si on est devenus colonels, c'est parce
qu'on est pas des demeurťs complets.
Robbie, mon pauvre vieux,
vous avez besoin d'un petit cafť, vous.
Ce mec est un dieu.
Colonel William A. Rawls - D.I.C.
Grand chef.
Je dois le ramener en haute sťcuritť
pour dix-huit heures, d'accord ?
Pigť. Viens par lŗ, frangin.
Vas-y, assieds-toi.
Sers-toi, mange avec moi.
- Non, j'ai pas faim, Áa va.
- Quoi ?
- Non.
- Tu sais, c'est super bon.
- T'as vraiment tort.
- Non.
…coute, vieux,
si ce mec continue ŗ dťmolir ta chambre,
nous on va continuer ŗ la remplir de bordel.
Il aura pas le temps de dťmolir un truc
qu'il y aura dťjŗ autre chose, tu comprends ?
Il s'en est pris ŗ mon aquarium, je te jure...
Il a ťtť trop loin lŗ, le mec.
- C'est quoi l'embrouille avec lui ?
- Tu te rappelles Ladontay ?
Tu sais l'arnaqueur de Poe Homes ?
On l'a chopť ŗ Carver.
Le parking ŗ cŰtť de l'ťcole.
On a fait Áa ?
Et Tilghman ťtait le cousin de Ladontay,
c'ťtait un parent.
Il a su que j'avais rien eu pour ce coup,
alors il m'en fait baver exprŤs.
Ladontay ?
Ce gars, je m'en souviens mÍme pas.
C'est un gros carnet qui te faut
pour noter ceux que t'as liquidťs.
Avon il s'accroche, et il va pas me l‚cher.
…coute. Je vais parler avec lui. D'accord ?
Je vais te rťgler cette histoire. «a te va ?
- C'est quoi son nom dťjŗ ?
- Tilghman. Service de jour ŗ l'ťtage J.
Je l'ai dťjŗ vu ici.
C'est dťbectant.
T'as tous ces gardiens qui font leur loi.
Toi, ils sont lŗ ŗ t'apporter tes repas et tout.
Et t'as ce fils de pute de Tilghman
qui joue au gardien rťglo.
Mais par en dessous, peinard,
il fait aussi ses petites magouilles.
Flippe pas, va. Flippe pas.
C'est rien. Je vais rťgler cette histoire.
La Ville n'en veut pas ?
Propriťtť des autoritťs portuaires.
C'est la juridiction de l'…tat.
Alors c'est pour la police d'…tat
de Pikesville.
C'est la criminelle qui devrait s'en charger.
Vous vous en foutez,
vous voulez juste emmerder Rawls, non ?
Absolument. Qu'est-ce que vous avez ?
- Vous faites Áa pour nuire ŗ votre patron ?
- S'ils se tapent pas l'enquÍte, ce sera vous.
Il vous faut quoi ?
Tout d'abord,
quelle taille avait le faux compartiment ?
Quatre de long, deux mŤtres de haut
et deux mŤtres de large.
Alors on a treize femmes adultes
respirant ŗ un rythme de normal ŗ ťlevť.
«a fait zťro vingt-cinq litre d'oxygŤne
par minute
par victime.
- C'est un mťdecin ?
- Non, il est du bureau des Mines de l'…tat.
- Les Mines ?
- Les Mines.
Officier Tilghman, j'aurais voulu parler
avec vous un instant.
Barksdale, c'est Áa ?
- Je voulais savoir si vous pouviez...
- Non.
- Je vous demande pardon ?
- J'ai dit non, pauvre connard.
Reste pas lŗ, toi !
Qu'est-ce que t'es encore
en train de magouiller ?
Tu prťpares un coup tordu ŗ quelqu'un,
McNulty, Áa se voit, je le sens.
C'est un ramassis de conneries.
Ces estimations ont ťtť vťrifiťes
et confirmťes
par le bureau du mťdecin lťgiste.
L'ťvaluation de l'heure de la mort
est exacte ŗ trois heures prŤs.
C'est ce que vous dites.
C'est votre gars de l'Unitť Maritime
qui a pris les mesures du conteneur.
Je connais trŤs bien
le gars de l'Unitť Maritime,
et c'est sans aucun doute le trou du cul
le plus prťtentieux
de toutes les forces de police amťricaines.
Je ne prendrai pas ces treize meurtres.
C'est hors de question.
Elles ťtaient mortes
quand le conteneur est arrivť ŗ quai.
Elles ont ťtť assassinťes sur le bateau.
Elles sont pour le Comtť de Baltimore
ou pour Anne Arundel,
de l'autre cŰtť du pont.
Si elles viennent de plus loin dans la baie,
c'est aux garde-cŰtes de s'en charger.
La ville n'est pas concernťe.
Je vous laisse discuter les gars.
C'est l'un de vous qui devra les prendre.
Non, Bill.
L'Atlantic Light a dťpassť le Key Bridge
ŗ vingt-trois heures.
Il a jetť l'ancre ŗ deux mille mŤtres
au large de Patapsco
jusqu'ŗ six heures du matin
oý il est allť ŗ quai.
- D'aprŤs la carte, c'est la ville de Baltimore.
- «a place le bateau sous votre juridiction
ŗ l'heure de la mort,
en tenant compte de la marge d'erreur.
Bill, on dirait qu'une tasse de cafť
vous ferait du bien.

Mikey !
- «a va ?
- Non.
Non quoi ?
Pas question, espŤce de face de rat.
T'as bousillť les deux derniers paquets.
Mikey, ťcoute, s'il te plaÓt.
Je te jure, c'ťtait pas moi.
Si t'as du blť, Ziggy, tu peux t'en acheter.
Si t'as pas de blť, va zoner ailleurs.
Je croyais qu'on ťtait potes.
T'as bien bousillť
les deux derniers paquets ?
- Plus ou moins.
- T'es pas un peu cassť, lŗ ?
- Non.
- Va faire un tour, mon vieux.
OUVERT
- Salut, Áa va ?
- «a va, mon pote ?
L'histoire ŗ Atlanta, Áa y est, c'est rťglť.
C'est dťjŗ une chose de faite.
Bien. Mais c'est pas pour Áa
que je t'ai appelť.
Je t'ai fait venir parce qu'on a
un des gardiens qui nous emmerde.
- Qui ?
- Il s'appelle Tilghman.
C'est le cousin du petit que Wee Bey
a descendu sur le parking d'une ťcole.
«a lui reste encore en travers de la gorge.
Tilghman ? D'accord.
Autre chose, Brianna m'a rappelť
qu'on a des promesses ŗ respecter.
Je sais. Je sais.
Faut que t'ailles voir la copine de Dee.
Il faut qu'elle vienne ici
avec le petit rťguliŤrement.
Il faut qu'elle se bouge
et qu'elle fasse sa part.
Je vois.
Et D'Angelo, Áa va ?
Je sais pas, il faut qu'il fasse ce qu'il faut.
Tu comprends ? Dee, il a besoin
qu'on l'aide un peu de temps en temps.
Mais il tient le coup,
il est pas en train de craquer ?
- Non, il tient le coup.
- T'es sŻr ?
- Il a un sacrť poids ŗ porter pour nous.
- String, il est de la famille.
T'entends ? Il est de la famille.
Allez, Jimmy. Bois !
Allez. Dis-lui que t'ťtais le premier.
Voilŗ.
C'est bien.
- Encore un, lŗ.
- Et voilŗ.
- Non, Áa suffÓt.
- Non !
Il faut que tu boives les quatorze verres,
mon pote.
Un pour chaque membre de la jolie famille
que tu viens de donner ŗ Cole.
ņ la santť de Ray Cole,
policier zťlť et homme de bien.
Jimmy, la tÍte de Jay Landsman !
Il ťtait ŗ deux doigts de chialer !
Et Rawls !
Et Rawls, je te jure, il en est restť enfermť
dans son bureau toute la journťe !
Tout l'aprŤs-midi !
Il a fermť sa porte et on l'a plus revu !
- ArrÍte, tu vas me donner une ťrection.
- Allez, mon vieux, allez !
EspŤce d'enfoirť, cette fois,
t'as vraiment fait trŤs fort.
Tu pourras jamais revenir aprŤs Áa,
tu le sais ?
Lester, qu'est-ce qu'ils pourraient me faire
qu'ils m'ont pas dťjŗ fait ?
Je bosse sur une saletť de bateau.
Putain, j'en ai rien ŗ foutre.
ņ la santť de Jane Doe numťro treize.
Et voilŗ.
Je suis prÍt ŗ rester, combien,
encore onze ans dans ce bordel.
Et aprŤs, je fais ma demande de pension
et je me casse, voilŗ.
Onze ans, c'est long
quand on reste dans un placard.
Tu peux en parler, monsieur Treize ans.
Et quatre mois.
C'est rien.
Peut-Ítre qu'ils te m‚chent ŗ fond,
mais ils sont obligťs de te recracher.
- Quatorze.
- Il l'a fait.
Merde.
Tiens-toi bien, je te ramasse pas moi, rigolo.
Vas-y, c'est par lŗ. Par lŗ.
- Il y a encore du monde, lŗ-dedans ?
- Ouais, ils gardent La-la.
Il avait un vieux mandat d'arrÍt contre lui.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il a fait ?
- J'en sais rien, une histoire de trafic.
Le garant est avec lui en train d'essayer
d'y comprendre quelque chose.
Qu'est-ce qui leur a pris, aux flics,
de toute faÁon ?
- Nous arrÍter en allant bosser.
- Une embrouille avec un chef de police,
- le frŤre de Charlie Valchek, le merdeux.
- Va vite falloir que tu rŤgles Áa mec.
- Ton embrouille, elle va trop loin !
- Ouais je m'en occupe, t'inquiŤte.
Les gars, vous voulez que je vous ramŤne ?
- Salut.
- Salut. ņ plus.
Si ce nain veut la guerre, il va l'avoir.
Il ťtait pas censť parler, de toute faÁon.
- Bunk ! Lester !
- Ouais ?
Vous les deux gťnies,
je vous donne les Jane Doe.
Quoi ? On n'est pas libres, Jay.
On a le double meurtre de Pimlico
de la semaine derniŤre.
Cole se charge du double meurtre.
- Et vous des filles en conserve.
- Mais c'est pas juste.
Ce qui n'est pas juste,
c'est que le taux d'ťlucidation
de notre ťquipe est nťgatif. Un taux nťgatif.
Alors, je suis pas en train de dire
que Ray Cole est un enquÍteur tocard,
mais il faut que ces quatorze cas
soient rťsolus.
Donc, je mets
mes meilleurs hommes dessus.
Ray !
Briefe-les.
Nom et numťro du flic de la portuaire
qui a dťcouvert le crime.
Chers collŤgues, je vous souhaite
chance et rťussite dans cette affaire.
Fils de pute.
Bťatrice Russell. Elle est jolie au moins ?
Hier, t'ťtais trop soŻl pour baiser.
Aujourd'hui, tu as trop mal au cr‚ne.
Qu'est-ce qui est le moins efficace
sur une femme ?
C'est un Irlandais ivre mort.
Mais t'es pas vraiment irlandais.
Je me suis descendu quatorze verres
de Jameson, c'est pas un pedigree, Áa ?
Si, c'est trŤs irlandais.
C'est aussi trŤs crťtin. Qui peut avoir l'idťe
de se siffler quatorze verres ?
Tu n'es qu'un gosse, McNulty.
Si tu dťbarques encore chez moi
ŗ deux heures du mat sans invitation,
- j'appelle les flics.
- Tu le feras jamais, j'en suis sŻr.
Jimmy.
Je suis ta petite amie ? Non. Ta femme ?
Non. Ton ‚me soeur ? Non.
Alors je suis quoi pour toi, Jimmy ?
On s'ťclate tous les deux.
Rťponds ŗ la question.
J'ai ťtť plutŰt honnÍte avec toi.
Ma femme propose qu'on se remette
ensemble et je suis prÍt ŗ tenter le coup.
Tu sais, ŗ cause des enfants et tout.
T'as de l'aspirine ?
Nom de Dieu, Ronnie, j'ai super mal !
Un vrai service de la police
aurait un ascenseur.
C'est vous, Russell ? Bunk Moreland.
- Lester Freamon.
- Bonjour.
Je suis en attente avec les garde-cŰtes,
le dťtachement de Delaware River.
Qu'est-ce qu'on sait ?
L'Atlantic Light est ŗ Philadelphie et ce soir,
il part pour le port d'Elizabeth.
- J'essaie de le retenir.
- Personne de votre Crim sur l'affaire ?
Non. Je crois savoir qu'il y a eu dťsaccord
sur la juridiction,
et votre colonel a fait enrager tout le monde.
- La seule lŗ-dessus, c'est moi.
- Toujours en attente ?
On peut les appeler de la voiture.
Vous Ítes de la Crim de Baltimore ?
- Vous connaissez Jimmy McNulty ?
- Pour nous, il est mort.
Messieurs, faites comme chez vous.
J'ai connu pire.
C'est louť par l'amťnagement,
mais on peut l'utiliser comme antenne.
- Le chauffage fonctionne ?
- Il fonctionne.
Et le tťlťphone aussi.
Arrivť en ťtť, il vous faudra une ventilation,
sŻrement.
Mais vous me faites l'impression
d'Ítre des gens capables de boucler
un dossier vite, bien et sans faire de vague.
Et lui, lŗ,
c'est l'enquÍteur de mon district :
Roland Pryzbylewski.
Ce petit est un prodige. Pour tout ce que
vous voudrez me demander, passez par lui.
Voilŗ, messieurs.
L'objectif est Frank Sobotka.
Et tous ceux avec lesquels Sobotka
fait ses sales magouilles.
Roland va maintenant vous donner
tous les dťtails. Bonne chasse.
Alors, qui signe les formulaires
d'heures sup ?
Quel enfoirť !
T'es vraiment un voleur de premiŤre.
- Voilŗ oý vont nos impŰts.
- J'ai fait du bon boulot.
On va le ranger dans le conteneur.
Horseface, vieille crapule.
Nom de Dieu, je vais me faire ťclater
la derniŤre burne qui me reste !
Allez les gars ! C'est pas plus lourd
que les palettes qu'on se coltinait avant !
Et la touche finale, les amis !

PORT DE PHILADELPHIE
ACC»S INTERDIT
L'accŤs ŗ ce secteur est interdit.
Pas de problŤme, monsieur, allez-y.
- Amir ! Amir ! Pourquoi on part pas ?
- Ils retiennent le bateau.
- Qui donc ?
- Les garde-cŰtes. Les Amťricains.
Pourquoi ?
Putain, Sergei !
T'as failli me casser la main !
Amenez-le !
- Bonne soirťe.
- Merci, au revoir.
Pousse-toi, ŗ moi.
C'est le dernier appel
avant la fermeture des portes, mec.
Allez, grouille-toi.
- Qu'est-ce que t'en dis ?
- C'est bon, mec, Áa fait du bien.
Elle est bonne.
T'as raison, ce crack est super.
Salut, mon frŤre. Fais gaffe ŗ toi.
- C'est ŗ lui ?
- Il l'a laissť.
C'est le sien.
- Comment tu vas ?
- «a va.
SŻr ?
Toi et moi, faut qu'on discute.
- Vous Ítes combien ŗ bord ?
- Trente-huit dans l'ťquipage.
Quatorze Yťmťnites, huit Sri Lankais.
Il y a cinq Philippins
et les autres sont plus ou moins d'ici.
- Est-ce qu'ils savent parler notre langue ?
- Vu la nature de vos questions,
Áa m'ťtonnerait qu'il y en ait un seul
qui aligne trois mots.
- Oý est le capitaine ?
- Il est avec les garde-cŰtes.
Et il est furieux parce qu'on devrait Ítre
dans le New Jersey demain matin.
Vous n'y arriverez pas.
Chaque jour que vous nous retenez ici
coŻte cent mille dollars ŗ l'agent maritime.
- L'Atlantic Light est une entreprise ťnorme.
- L'Atlantic Light est la scŤne d'un meurtre.
N'essaie pas de jouer au dur.
Enfin ŗ toi de voir.
Moi je ne reÁois pas les coups.
Parle !
Dis-moi ce que je veux savoir.
Allez, ramasse-le.
- Parle-nous des filles.
- Pas de fille. Rien.
Comprends pas.
Tu piges pas notre langue,
mais tu sais bien courir.
Pourquoi tu t'es enfui du bateau ?
Qu'est-ce que tu racontes,
Áa veut dire quoi ?
Ils l'ont coincť ŗ Philadelphie.
Il a sautť quand il a vu
que les garde-cŰtes retenaient le bateau.
- Il est d'oý ?
- Sergei dit qu'il a l'air d'Ítre Arabe.
Il ne sait rien du tout.
Mais vous avez continuť ŗ la tabasser.
Donnez-lui ses habits.
Si Áa te dťrange pas, je m'en allume une.
- Allez. Si on discutait ?
- Pas comprendre.
Dis-moi ce qui s'est passť avec les filles.
Pas parler.
Bon alors quelle langue tu parles ?
S'il te plaÓt, parle-moi, mon ami.
Tu es turc, alors ?
Il y a la forme de ton nez, c'est vrai.
Ne t'inquiŤte pas, patrioti.
Je n'ai rien contre les Turcs.
C'ťtait l'ancien monde. C'est le nouveau.
Sam.
- Je ne sais rien du tout sur les...
- Tu sais.
Tu sais et tu vas tout me raconter.
Et ensuite,
ce sera fini. Je te donne ma parole.
On a ouvert le conteneur
pour qu'elles puissent se laver.
Qu'elles respirent de l'air frais.
Et vous savez, mes hommes, ils tiraient
sur leurs pootsos depuis des semaines,
ces filles, elles ťtaient plutŰt jolies.
- Katalavenis ?
- Oui.
Les hommes avaient de l'argent ŗ dťpenser.
Je l'avoue, j'ai voulu me faire du fric,
mais c'ťtait tout.
Que s'est-il passť ?
Une des pootanas a dťcidť
qu'elle ne voulait plus Ítre une pootana.
Le gars a ťtť violent avec elle.
Elle est morte.
Les autres l'ont vu.
Je ne savais pas quoi faire.
- Tu en tues une, tu tues toutes les autres ?
- Non. C'est un autre homme qui l'a fait.
Un autre homme ? Dis-moi qui.
La fille tuťe,
elles savaient, elles ont vu.
Dťtends-toi.
Je t'ai donnť ma parole.
- Attention ŗ vos chaussures.
- Saletť de Turc.
Il saigne comme un agneau.
En un an, chaque fille aurait rapportť
un quart de million. «a fait quoi ?
Quatre millions de dollars.
Non.
Malaka.
C'est pas grave, il y aura d'autres filles.
Oui, pour lui,
plus d'empreintes digitales.
- Et plus de visage.
- Aucun problŤme.
Ça roule ? T'étais où ?
Nulle part, man. Je tramais.
Dans quelques secondes,
tu vas voir le petit frère de Darnell
sortir avec un panier à linge.
- Y cache son fric dans un panier ?
- Il en sort un l'après-midi et un le soir,
et c'est toujours le même panier
qu'il trimballe.
Comment tu sais ?
Fallait bien qu'ils sortent d'une manière
ou d'une autre.
Alors, on n'a pas besoin de tout faire péter,
on a qu'à attendre tranquilles
que ces connards sortent de leur trou.
Le gros lot c'est pour ce soir, chéri.
À la tombée de la nuit.
Si tu le dis.
Pose ton panier, connard.
Pose ton panier ! Vite ! Putain, merde !
- Putain, j'ai dit pose ton panier !
- Doucement, ma poule cool.
Eh oui, tu t'es fait avoir mon pote !
T'as un joli petit cul, mais tu t'es fait avoir.
C'est le jeu mon gros, c'est pas grave.
Classe. Très classe.
Salopes !
Dis donc,
c'est pas tous les jours qu'on voit ça.

"Ce qu'il leur faudrait, c'est un syndicat."
- Russell
"Mishie ggoshie messhie messhie mushie."
Gros rigolo, va.
Écoute, le clown, t'as dû faire au moins
trois fois le tour de la Terre
et tu parles pas un mot de notre langue ?
Dans notre langue,
espèce d'enfoiré de nègre !
Il en manque deux et les autres
se foutent de notre gueule.
Je vous l'avais dit. Ici, les questions,
on aime pas beaucoup ça.
Ouais, en gros les flics se barrent
et tout le monde parle anglais.
C'est ça. En gros, oui.
Voilà tout ce qui reste du bonhomme.
Il était à bord depuis Trieste.
Il a tout embarqué avec lui quand il a sauté.
- Y en a beaucoup qui sautent des bateaux ?
- Quelques-uns.
Après la paie, en général.
C'est ce qui s'est passé à Norfolk.
Choksey avait demandé une avance
et on lui avait donnée en coupons.
Bon. Pas de papiers d'identité, pas d'argent.
On peut pas dire qu'il ait perdu le nord.
Quelqu'un d'autre a demandé une avance
pendant que vous étiez en mer ?
- Plus que d'habitude.
- Oui ?
On distribuait de plus en plus de coupons.
On avait presque du mal à fournir.
On s'est dit qu'ils devaient faire des paris
dans les soutes.
Ou peut-être pas. Va savoir.
Le container des filles était en cale neuf,
tout en bas. Dehors.
- Vous avez jeté un oeil à cette cale ?
- Et oui.
Des containers pour l'export
chargés à Hampton Roads.
Rien à signaler
à part un tas de nouveaux containers.
Si vous nous retenez une autre journée
et que vous amenez des interprètes,
les gars ne vous diront rien.
Ici la règle, c'est que tout ce qui se passe
sous le pont reste sous le pont.
Tiens-toi bien.
Y a des gens qui paient et qui attendent.
Ashley, assieds-toi.
T'as pas peur que ce soit trop court ?
Évite surtout de me faire une tête de nase.
Tu sais que la crèche a téléphoné ?
- Y veulent encore plus d'argent ?
- Pas plus qu'on ne leur doit.
- Et son maître a dit qu'Ashley...
- Son maître ?
- C'est rien que des baby-sitters.
- Tu parles.
Oui, n'empêche qu'Ashley raconte en classe
que papa et maman vivent pas ensemble.
Qui lui a posé la question ?
On lui a rien demandé,
elle raconte, c'est tout.
Les gosses, ça voit ce genre de truc,
ils en parlent entre eux.
Ça va être un problème
quand elle rentrera en primaire.
D'ici qu'elle y rentre, ça fera longtemps
qu'on vivra sous le même toit.
Oui, c'est déjà ce que t'avais dit à Noël.
Merde ! Tu les coupes ou tu les arraches ?
Écoute, Nicky.
Si tu veux aller vers quelque chose
de mieux, je te suivrai.
Si tu ne veux pas nous faire avancer,
faudra que je revoie les choses.
Fais comme tu le sens.
Dès que j'aurai un peu de temps devant moi,
je me trouve un appartement.
Si tu veux vivre avec moi. Génial.
Si tu veux pas, alors au moins,
j'aurais fait de mon mieux.
Tu veux un petit truc spécial ?
Je peux mettre un peu de mauve, si tu veux.
Ouais, génial, comme ça,
j'aurais plus qu'à aller planter ma langue
dans le trou du cul d'un vioque.
Ils vous l'ont mis profond ?
Vous trouvez ?
Non, enfin je veux dire,
sauf si bosser au vingtième sous-sol
vous excite pour une raison que j'ignore.
- Désolé, lieutenant.
- On s'en fout ? Non ?
Au moins, on a lancé l'affaire.
Vous bossez sur un bateau ?
C'est pas si mal.
Comment va Kima ?
Elle est dans le service.
Elle est rangée à la saisie des actifs
et elle est en deuxième année de droit.
Une chatte d'intérieur.
C'est pas trop le genre.
- Alors, ça revient ?
- Oui.
Voilà toute l'affaire Gant.
Nathan a jeté un oeil
sur nos pauvres petits trucs
et soit je retrouve Omar,
soit elle laisse tomber.
- Et alors vous avez une piste ?
- Pas la moindre.
La dernière fois que je l'ai vu,
je le mettais dans le car pour New York.
Gardez le profil bas, lieutenant.
Dans un an ou deux,
vous aurez à nouveau la côte.
Dans un an ou deux, je serai avocat.
J'ai déjà donné vingt-deux ans.
Je dépose mon dossier cette semaine.
Alors, vous vous tirez ?
Expliquez-moi ce que je fous là
avec un diplôme de droit.
Prenez soin de vous, McNulty.
Vous aussi.
Kimmy, j'essaie seulement de te dire
que si t'arrêtais de fumer un peu,
- tu comprendrais peut-être...
- Oui, bien tu sais quoi ? Je vais fumer.
- C'est trop long !
- Je t'aime bien, mais si tu...
Puis si c'est trop long,
t'as qu'à compter, toi, ce fric merde.
- Putain, je t'adore mais t'es chiante !
- C'est pas vrai, presque cinq mille.
On leur a mis profond à ces connards.
On les a bien eus.
Putain, t'es qui toi ?
- Omar voudrait te causer.
- Omar ? Putain.
Il est pas mort ce négro ? J'ai entendu dire
qu'il avait été flingué dans les tours.
Non, je crois pas.
Je crois qu'il a été voir ailleurs.
Allez prévenir le monde, les filles.
Omar est de retour.
Bunk ? Regarde comment Crutchfield
a écrit "prostré".
Regarde.
"La victime susnommée
était prostate sur le sol."
"Prostate sur le sol."
Putain, ça c'est de la victime.
Ça doit faire mal !
J'adore ce job.
- Vous voulez des nouvelles de Philly ?
- Juste les trucs sexuels.
Pour ce qui est du bateau, c'est mort.
La cale qui contenait notre container
est pleine de nouvelles boîtes.
Rien à en tirer.
Et l'équipage a passé son temps
à nous mentir dans toutes les langues,
cette bande de fiottes.
Et ils ont repris la mer
en se foutant de notre gueule.
C'est tout ?
Deux gars ont sauté du bateau.
On a demandé des télétypes
au cas où ça renverrait à quelque chose.
L'un deux avait laissé des affaires,
on les a gardées. Voilà.
- Eh bien, ça fait pas très costaud tout ça.
- C'est parce que ça l'est pas.
Mais votre suspect devait bien
être sur le bateau, d'accord ?
Et votre bateau s'est fait la malle.
Jay, bon Dieu,
qu'est ce que tu voulais qu'on fasse ?
Qu'on bloque le rafiot et qu'on papote avec
quarante loufiats en cinquante dialectes ?
OK, si c'est pas ça le plan
alors c'est quoi ?
- Agent...
- Russell.
On m'a informé de votre venue
sur cette enquête
afin de faire la liaison avec la police du port.
Et si mes infos sont exactes,
vous êtes la seule aide
que votre service
ait bien voulu nous envoyer.
Ah oui ?
Oui, alors bien qu'un certain charme
se dégage d'une femme en uniforme,
le fait est qu'ici, on bosse en civil à la Crim.
Vos vêtements ne doivent pas
être austères pour autant.
Pour vous, je verrais bien un petit tailleur
modérément coloré, assez frais.
Disons quelque chose qui rehausserait
la petite rayure légale de Moreland
et calmerait un peu
les impertinences tweedesques de Freamon.
Rawls est très attentif à cette affaire.
Alors, je compte sur vous pour faire
au moins semblant d'avoir une idée.
Les impertinences tweedesques ?
- J'aime bien.
- C'est pas la classe ?
- Bien je sais pas, il est pas là.
- Oui, ça je vois bien, mais il est où ?
L'équipe mobile l'a utilisé mardi dernier.
Le registre indique
qu'ils l'ont rapporté à vingt-deux heures
et qu'ils ont rendu les clés à l'officier.
- Et alors ?
- Et alors on a les clés, chef.
Mais pas le véhicule.
Seriez-vous en train de me dire
qu'un véhicule de surveillance,
entièrement équipé,
d'une valeur de cent vingt mille dollars,
et assigné à mon district
a disparu dans la nature ?
FIERTÉ DU PORT
Soutenez les Wilmington I.B.S.
- En route pour le tour du monde...
- En huit cent quatre vingt jours !
- Vous avez un plan ?
- Un plan ?
- Oui, pour coincer Sobotka.
- Je sais pas trop.
Peut-être qu'on pourrait trouver
où est son syndicat,
planquer un ou deux gars
et tenter le flagrant délit.
- On place une D.N.R sur son téléphone ?
- Une D.N.R. ?
Pour savoir qui il appelle.
Pour repérer ses habitudes.
En premier le flag, je crois.
Oui. Six cents actions de chacune.
C'est ça.
C'est trop joli ce coup, pour un maton.
Ouais.
Moi, tu me paierais jamais assez
pour que je bosse dans une prison.
Oui, t'as raison. Non, vire-moi
toutes les sociétés de portables.
- Ouais, toutes : Nokia, Motorola.
- Stringer qui joue à Wall Street.
OK. On s'appelle. Salut.
String ? Qu'est-ce que t'as
contre les sociétés de portables ?
Y a pas longtemps,
j'ai été faire une virée au milieu des tours
et j'ai vu ce gosse
qui dirige nos affaires là-bas, Poot.
Je lui ai filé un téléphone à utiliser
pour le business et seulement pour ça,
mais le gosse, il en a un autre et celui-là,
il sonne juste pour sa petite chatte, tu vois.
Alors si un nègre de seconde zone
a déjà deux téléphones,
comment tu fais
pour en vendre un de plus ?
Saturation du marché, les mecs.
Regarde ça. Regarde ça.
Ce brave Tilghman, juste devant,
- avec son costume de maton.
- Ouais. J'ai vu.
Porte en acier.
Un mec sur l'escalier et c'est tout.
Stump est assis sur le rebord de la fenêtre
et il zieute sa putain de télé.
- Tu voyais tout ça d'où t'étais postée ?
- On voyait même la bosse de son caleçon.
Ta gueule, le chien !
Si le rat atteint la poubelle, il est sauvé.
Ouais, Junk, si ça continue,
tu vas te faire baiser.
Je parie vingt dollars sur le rat.
Alors, y en a un qui me suit ?
Allez, le rat. Allez, tire-toi.
Cent dollars sur le chien. Suivi.
Faut prendre le fric quand c'est facile,
pas vrai ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est que cette merde ?
- Il est con ce rat !
- Et cent dollars pour Butchie !
Et comment tu savais
ce qu'il allait faire, le rat ?
Qu'est-ce que tu crois,
y connaît la vermine !
Oui.
Qu'est-ce qui va pas, petit ?
Écoute, je t'ai déjà expliqué
que j'en avais rien à cirer de ces deux pouffes.
Si jamais je trouve un plan
pour se faire Stump sans elles,
tu les laisses tomber ?
Alors, c'est toi le stratège, maintenant ?
Pourquoi on se casse le cul,
on a qu'à attendre qu'il sorte.
Le seul problème,
c'est que Stump vit dans ce trou à rat, bébé.
Alors, il a pas besoin de sortir son fric.
Tu comprends ?
Alors on a qu'à foncer dans le tas
et on lui explose tout.
Et qu'est-ce tu fais de la porte ?
Écoute Dante, qu'est-ce que je dois faire,
putain, pour te convaincre
que je couche pas avec des femmes ?
À ton avis ?
Il va falloir faire mieux que ça, chéri.
Oui ? Tu vas voir.
Je crois qu'on pourrait faire un quart,
cette fois. Enfin, si c'est pas trop.
Ça pose un problème ?
Non, non.
C'est juste que je trouve
que t'es revenu un peu vite, quoi.
C'est que ces fils de putes
ont rien d'autre à glander.
- Ils sont rien à part cette merde.
- Très juste. Ça aussi c'est juste ?
Mon gars te la donnera dehors.
Tilghman.
Alors sa came, c'est Butchie ?
- D'accord.
- Butchie, l'Aveugle.
- Dis, les elfes du Père Noël, ils sont petits ?
- Ça existe pas, les elfes de Père Noël.
C'est les elfes du Seigneur des anneaux
qui existent.
- C'est des vrais, eux ?
- Alors, ils doivent être petits.
Les nains et les Hobbits sont petits,
mais les elfes sont grands et immortels.
Si t'avais pas tant la trouille de regarder
le film, tu saurais ça par coeur, abruti.
Et toi, t'as la bite qui pue !
- Sean, ça suffit !
- T'entends ce qui dit ?
Allez, vous montez tout de suite,
vous vous brossez les dents et en pyjama.
Demain, y a école. Non, Sean.
Je peux les accompagner ?
Mon avocat t'a fait parvenir quelque chose
par la poste.
- Tu rigoles.
- Ce n'est pas un divorce.
- C'est une séparation à l'amiable.
- Une séparation à l'amiable ?
S'il te plaît, lis-la. OK ?
C'est pour notre bien à tous les deux.
C'est pour nous protéger tous les deux.
Ça parle de quoi ?
C'est juste...
Écoute, tu devrais la lire. D'accord ?
Bon, d'accord.
Putain, tous les jours on se lève à l'aube
et on a que dalle, fait chier.
- Je me demande pourquoi je m'emmerde.
- C'est vrai ça, on se demande.
Aujourd'hui, un bateau, hier, pas un seul.
Jeudi, sur les deux rafiots
qui vont se pointer,
on a toutes les chances de faire ceinture,
tu vas voir.
Et vendredi, c'est calme plat. Comme d'hab.
Bien, t'as qu'à te dire que ça te fait
une journée de vacances en plus.
Oui, qu'est-ce que j'en ai à foutre, moi,
d'une journée de vacances ? Putain !
Je supporte plus, moi, de me lever le matin
sans savoir si je vais être payé.
J'ai un gosse, d'accord ?
J'ai un putain de gosse
et une nana qui veut se marier,
c'est pas du vent, ça.
Qu'est ce que t'as besoin de te marier,
aussi ?
J'ai jamais dit que je voulais.
Mais si au moins je pouvais avoir
de vraies chiottes pour pisser.
Aimée, elle est du genre :
"C'est quoi le plan ?" Tu vois le truc ?
Et moi, je suis là à me demander
si je vais avoir un jour, tu parles.
Au fait ? La soeur d'Aimée,
elle a quitté Petie ou pas ?
C'est ça ton problème, Ziggy,
un de tes problèmes, en tout cas.
Le seul truc qui t'intéresse, c'est ta queue.
Moi, c'est sexe et whisky tous les jours.
- Arrête. Lâche-moi.
- Allez, Nicky, attends !
Si c'est vraiment l'argent qui te pose
un problème, on peut toujours s'arranger.
On met quelques dollars en commun
et je vais trouver mon mec enfin tu vois,
on racole le matin,
et on se fait plus de fric en trois heures
qu'on s'en fait ici en toute une semaine.
Je suis pas... Écoute.
Je suis pas comme tous ces Blacks
qui se font buter pour quelques dollars.
Fais pas chier avec ça ! Sérieux. Je te jure.
- Où tu vas comme ça ?
- Je vais réfléchir à des trucs.
Onze et neuf cents. Et on est au bout.
On cherche le 14580
si l'on en croit ce qui est écrit.
Impossible,
les chiffres ne montent pas si haut.
Un port, ça fonctionne comme ça.
Bon ?
Si on trimballe de la contrebande,
on refile n'importe quelle adresse
et n'importe quel nom de société.
Et côté expéditeur aussi. C'est ça ?
Vous pourriez la tracer jusqu'à la douane.
Mais il y a de fortes chances
que cette boîte n'ait pas été embarquée,
rue de Rivoli
au Havre, en France.
Comme l'indique l'adresse.
Si ça se trouve, y a même pas
de rue de Rivoli dans cette ville.
Un container de filles mortes
envoyé nulle part et venant de nulle part.
- Il a fait du bon boulot pour moi, tu sais.
- Oui ?
Ouais, il fait presque trois quarts
par semaine.
Le fric de Tilghman
est toujours à l'heure et juste.
Bien justement,
c'est pour ça qu'on vient te voir.
- T'as toujours été le meilleur.
- Ouais.
Je sais, le fric, et tu sais qu'on va trouver
une solution pour arranger ça.
Et tu sais, cette faveur, Butchie,
elle est pas pour moi.
Elle est pour mon gars, tu comprends.
- Avon est de retour.
- Autrement je serais pas là.
- Avon, c'est Avon.
- Comme toujours.
Normalement, il devrait faire un saut demain
dans la soirée.
Ça va marcher.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire, non ?
Ça n'aurait aucun sens
d'amener les filles pour les tuer.
Tu fais tout pour refourguer l'affaire
à ton boss et là, t'arrives plus à dormir.
- Non, j'y pense, quoi, c'est tout.
- Je crois que c'est un peu tard, McNulty.
Quel est le lien entre la fille
dans l'eau et les filles du container ?
- Si elle est pas d'ici, alors...
- C'est sûr, elle est pas d'ici.
La viscosité du mercure
dans la restauration d'amalgame indique
qu'elle vient d'Europe de l'Est.
- Si tu le dis, alors.
- Crois-moi, elle vient d'Europe de l'Est.
Europe de l'Est. Super.
Tu peux pas être plus précis ?
Si. Trois des filles asphyxiées se sont
rendues à Budapest l'année dernière.
Comment tu sais ça ?
Elles ont acheté des seins là-bas.
Trois filles se sont fait gonfler la poitrine.
On a étudié les poches après l'autopsie.
On a retrouvé les numéros de série.
Et ça nous a amenés
jusqu'à une clinique en Hongrie.
Et vous les avez appelés ?
Ils doivent bien avoir un dossier.
La seule chose intéressante,
c'est que les implants sont de cet automne.
Donc, on a trois filles,
trois opérations dans la même clinique.
- Quoi d'autre ?
- Quoi d'autre ?
- Va te faire voir, McNulty.
- OK, OK, t'es un putain de Dieu.
Personne au monde ne t'arrive à la cheville.
T'es un maître, Frazier.
Faut quand même admettre que le truc
de Budapest, c'est pas du tout cuit.
- Il est passé où le dossier du gus, là ?
- Je sais pas. Je vais voir.
Allez, vas-y, quoi d'autre ?
Pas grand-chose, mais les prélèvements
montrent qu'au moins sept des filles
ont eu des rapports vaginaux
vingt-quatre heures avant leur mort.
Deux d'entre elles ont eu un rapport anal
et six un rapport oral.
Et à Cole ? Tu lui as dit, tout ça ?
J'ai envoyé les premiers éléments à la Crim,
mais Cole il est pas sur le coup.
- Bon ? Alors qui ?
- Ton pote, Bunk,
et un type un peu plus vieux,
c'est eux qui s'y collent.
Merci.
Qui c'est qui va boire
un bon soda tout frais ?
Ça va mieux, ma grande ?
Maintenant, regarde-moi. Ne laisse jamais
les méchants garçons te voir pleurer.
- D'accord ?
- D'accord.
Viens, on va arranger ça.
Monsieur Stump ?
Les garçons ont encore embêté Chantelle.
Eh oui, mec.
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
- Salut Bobby, comment ça va ?
- Pas mal.
- T'es en étage, aujourd'hui ?
- Ouais. Au J.
- Bonne journée.
- Ouais. Toi aussi.
T'es content maintenant, salope ?
Quoi. Je pouvais pas savoir
que Landsman allait virer Cole
et vous mettre sur le coup.
Ça va, vous tenez le coup ?
- Pourquoi a-t-il gardé Cole ?
- C'est un dommage collatéral.
Et si j'osais, je dirais même
que je me sens très collatéral, sur ce coup.
C'est pour ça que je suis allé voir Dr Frazier,
et que j'ai cogité.
Ce bon McNulty aurait pu
ne pas prêter attention à cette affaire,
mais si ses amis saignent,
alors il saigne avec eux.
Vous avez vu les résultats ?
Positif pour oral, vaginal et anal.
Pas de carte d'identité, pas de passeport,
aucun visa, aucun blé sur elles
et elles traversent l'océan comme ça !
- Ouais.
- McNulty a une théorie.
- Non, c'est vrai ?
- Tu sais que t'es un sacré déductif, toi ?
Oui, je suis sûr qu'il se pointe chez nous
pour nous dire un truc éclairé,
du genre ces filles ont traversé l'océan
pour venir se prostituer.
Que si elles n'ont pas d'argent pour voyager
autrement que dans un container,
elles n'en ont plus pour se payer
de la chirurgie plastique.
Ensuite, il va nous parler
de celle qui était dans l'eau,
de celle qu'on a jetée par-dessus bord
après l'avoir battue à mort.
Et pourquoi a-t-elle été battue à mort ?
Il va demander ça comme si on savait pas.
Il va répondre à sa question et nous dire
que les prélèvements sont négatifs.
Soit tu baises, soit tu te bats
avec les marins et elle s'est battue.
Évidemment, elle faisait pas trop le poids.
Alors, elle a pris une raclée.
Et elle en est morte, pas de chance.
Et alors quelqu'un a paniqué
et il l'a balancé dans le port
avant que le bateau ne jette l'ancre.
Mais les autres filles ont vu la scène.
Alors, on leur dit : "Allez, vite,
retournez dans votre boîte de conserve."
Et là, notre mec, pour couvrir sa merde,
il grimpe sur le toit de la boîte et pan,
il écrase l'arrivée d'air.
- T'avais encore autre chose à nous dire ?
- Quand est-ce que vous y êtes allés ?
Hier. Et c'est là que le second nous a appris
que durant la traversée,
la moitié de l'équipage
était venue réclamer des avances.
Soit il y avait une drôle de partie de dés
sous le pont,
soit ils avaient sorti les filles.
Vous les avez interrogés ?
- Et dans quelle langue ?
- La scène du crime ?
- On sait pas.
- Il manquait personne ?
Deux hommes ont sauté du bateau.
Un à Philadelphie, l'autre à Norfolk.
Mais ce genre de truc
arrive fréquemment, paraît-il.
- Vous avez une sacrée vacherie d'enquête.
- C'est ça, merci beau cul.
Vous savez ce qui va arriver à ces filles
si vous ne les identifiez pas ?
Elles vont servir dans les cours d'anatomie.
Ensuite, crématorium,
et fin du voyage à la fosse de Crownsville.
Et ça vous ferait de la peine ?
Oui, un peu.
Moi aussi.
- Merci pour cette réception, mon père !
- J'espère que ça vous aidera.
Vous avez bien bossé.
Les syndicats du port
sont bien représentés, cette année.
- Le Gouverneur nous écoutera-t-il ?
- C'est maintenant ou jamais pour nous.
Et non seulement pour le quai à grain,
pour la drague aussi.
Je me fiche des conclusions
du corps des ingénieurs.
- Le fait est...
- Pardon, Bobby.
Je vous le ramène dans quelques minutes.
J'ai deux trois trucs à voir avec lui, là-bas.
Tu perds ton temps avec ce type.
Bobby, c'est le district sept.
C'est-à-dire qu'il est au centre de tout.
Une personne sur deux votant pour lui
est liée au port.
Il nous suivra quel que soit notre projet.
Non, les gars que tu dois convaincre,
ce sont tous les gars
qui seraient pas venus
si on leur avait pas filé du blé.
- Comme qui ?
- Comme John Carney, d'Anne Arundel,
ou Liz Tobin, de Montgomery.
Comme Clay Davis, du district ouest.
Les lâche pas. Certains
de tes projets sont dans le budget.
- Et on peut compter sur eux ?
- Carney est plutôt fermé.
Liz restera solide si les écologistes
ne nous tombent pas dessus.
Quant à Clay Davis, il faudra t'assurer qu'il
sera le dernier à rester dans cette pièce.
Ça veut dire quoi ?
Que nous avons déjà donné 40 000 $
à l'organisation démocrate de l'ouest
et que cet enfoiré a toujours la main tendue.
On a dépensé quarante mille sur ce gars ?
Il les vaut s'il laisse naviguer tes projets
au comité de conférence.
- Quarante mille putain de dollars ?
- Je fais du lobbying pour toi. Tu me paies ?
Fais-moi confiance.
Avec les joueurs présents ici
et avec un petit coup de pouce
du bureau du Gouverneur,
on devrait pouvoir obtenir quelque chose
de cette session.
Allez, va faire le beau.
- Sénateur Davis ?
- Excusez-moi.
Salut, partenaire.
Certaines personnes disent que ça pourrait
être une bonne année pour le port.
Peut-être bien.
Vous avez tous bien avancé
dans de nombreuses directions
et j'espère que ça continuera ainsi.
Vous vous faites des amis un peu partout ?
On est des gars cools.
Alors, elles étaient mortes
quand elles sont arrivées ?
J'avoue que je ne m'attendais pas à ça.
Qui aurait pu le prévoir ?
Celui qui a fait venir ces filles
subit une perte considérable
- s'élevant à plusieurs millions de dollars.
- Tant que ça ?
Une seule de ces filles travaillant de club
en club et uniquement sur la côte Est,
peut rapporter en deux ans
un demi-million de dollars
et encore,
je ne parle que de ces activités en club.
- Dans ce cas, quelqu'un a merdé.
- Et pas qu'un peu.
Vous l'aviez pressenti.
Pas d'adresse de ce type au Havre,
ni où que ce soit dans toute la Bretagne,
d'ailleurs.
Quant au nom et aux coordonnées
du chauffeur ayant signé le bon de dépôt,
ils ne correspondent d'aucune façon
à l'historique du véhicule.
Ça coince de partout.
Ces filles, elles savent
ce qu'elles viennent faire ici ?
Certaines, oui.
D'autres croient qu'elles seront danseuses
ou bien secrétaires.
Comprenez qu'elles viennent
de pays où il n'y a pas grand-chose.
De Roumanie, de Moldavie,
de Russie, d'Albanie.
Rien qu'aux États-Unis, il y a plus
de quarante mille femmes sans papiers.
50 000 ? Bon Dieu !
Faudrait créer un service de police
rien que pour elles.
Ce qu'il leur faudrait, c'est un syndicat.
- À Stan et Kate.
- À Stan et Kate.
Joyeux anniversaire. Tchin !
Merci à vous tous.
- C'est un beau moment ?
- Oui, papa.
Alors, comment va mon équipe ?
Le lieutenant Grayson est bien sur le coup,
n'est-ce pas ?
Burrell l'a recommandé. Pour les délits
dans l'immobilier, y avait pas mieux.
- Bien, ça risque d'être long.
- Tu crois ?
Pourquoi ? Qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Pas grand-chose.
On a pas une écoute en place. On ne fouille
aucun lieu de réunion syndicale.
On ne centralise aucune information,
d'aucune sorte,
et on étudie pas les comportements.
Pourtant c'est ça.
C'est ça que j'essayais de te dire
pour Barksdale.
Si tu t'en mêles en te disant
que tu mangeras ce qui dépasse,
t'as pas fini d'avoir faim.
Pour Barksdale, Daniels et Freamon
nous ont fait faire un tas de trucs.
La mise sur écoute,
la liste de tous leurs véhicules,
les contributions aux campagnes.
Si Burrell n'avait pas arrêté l'enquête si vite,
on aurait pu ramener trois ou quatre
millions de biens immobiliers,
sans parler de l'argent que ces types
ont donné aux campagnes électorales.
On en sait long sur eux.
C'est ça que j'essayais de te dire.
Sans Burrell, ça aurait été un coup énorme.
- String.
- Je venais prendre de tes nouvelles.
- Voir comment tu t'en sortais.
- Je m'en sors.
- Et le petit gars, il est où ?
- Je viens juste de le coucher.
Tu veux boire quelque chose ?
Est-ce que D'Angelo
se rend compte de ce qu'il rate ?
Oui. Je suis sûr que oui.
Tu viens de me faire penser
à quelque chose.
Y a encore l'étiquette.
Dee l'avait acheté
avant de se faire arrêter à Jersey.
Il ne l'a jamais porté.
J'ai toujours trouvé
que c'était dommage de gâcher.
Tu sais, tu peux te débarrasser
des fringues d'un mec,
mais tu peux pas te débarrasser
de lui comme ça.
Je ne l'oublie pas.
Non, mais t'as pas été le voir beaucoup,
ces derniers temps.
- Ça a été dur.
- Ça a été dur ?
Ça a été dur pour lui aussi.
Y a pas mal de trucs
qui passent dans la tête d'un homme
quand il est enfermé, alors il a besoin
de voir la maman de son bébé
et de voir son petit gars, aussi.
C'est les choses sur lesquelles
il a besoin de compter, sinon,
il va commencer à se dire
qu'il ne pourra pas purger sa peine,
et on aura tous des problèmes.
Tu piges ?
C'est vrai, tu t'en sors ?
L'appart, la voiture, le fric, ça va ?
- Ça va.
- Ça va.
Je sais bien que ça va.
Mais je pense que t'as entendu
ce que je venais de dire.
Ton job à toi, c'est de faire savoir à Dee
qu'on est toujours une famille.
C'est important.
Je mets du XXL.
J'en suis sûre
- C'est ta tournée, Jimmy.
- Mon Dieu !
Si je ne sors pas d'ici tout de suite,
je vais devoir mon salaire à la baby-sitter.
- Vous avez des enfants ?
- Deux.
- Le papa travaille tard, aussi ?
- Il a jamais rien fichu de toute sa vie.
Non, laissez, vous n'avez rien bu.
Bonne nuit, messieurs.
- Bonne nuit.
- Bonne nuit.
- Ça veut dire quoi, ça ?
- Je sais pas, moi.
Je vais te dire ce que je vais faire.
- Tu vas résoudre cette enquête.
- J'aime quand tu m'interromps.
- Je vais donner un nom à cette fille.
- Un nom ?
La fosse commune de Crownsville
n'accueillera pas ses restes.
- J'en fais le serment.
- Oui ? Et tu vas faire comment ?
Payer un entrepreneur de pompes funèbres
et l'expédier rue Cul baise en Europe ?
Non, je vais retrouver sa famille.
Tu parles d'un projet. Je vais te dire.
C'est un truc de catho à la noix ça, Jimmy.
C'est de la vieille culpabilité
d'enfant de choeur qui ressort.
Merde, pourquoi je me sentirais
coupable de ça ?
Je vais calculer les probabilités, attends.
Bonjour, chef.
Bon Dieu...
Wilmington ? Sac à merde !
- Frank ?
- Salut, Ring, comment ça va ?
Pas super.
- Avec ce qui se passe.
- Bon ?
Je suis en retard sur mes cotisations,
t'es au courant de ça ?
Ouais, t'es en retard.
J'en suis même à garer ma bagnole
à deux pâtés de maison de chez moi,
tout en espérant que l'huissier
soit une feignasse.
T'es si mal que ça ?
Je sais que t'as pas fait beaucoup d'heures,
c'est plutôt mou.
J'ai fait que cinq jours le mois dernier.
- C'est tout.
- Et donc ?
Écoute, il faut que je bosse
ou faut que je me tire.
- Je vais tenter ma chance au quarante-sept.
- Ringo, fais-moi plaisir.
T'as toujours été juste.
Je le pense, sinon je le dirais pas,
mais y a soixante contrôleurs avec
plus d'ancienneté que moi. Je suis coincé.
Fais-moi plaisir. Va à Clément Street ce soir
et donne ça à Dolores.
Dis-lui que je t'offre une bière et un whisky.
Paie-toi une tournée et rentre chez toi.
Si demain, tu te pointes en m'annonçant
que tu vas au 47, eh bien je serai d'accord.
Merci.
Allée 4. Code camion et étiquette ?
File-moi vite un ticket gagnant, Johnny.
- T'es assez moche pour faire camionneur.
- C'est ça, lèche mon cul, connard.
Ce sera sur roues. Allée K, lot 122.
Bien reçu.
On a une erreur de livraison.
Le container devait être débarqué à Norfolk.
- Bon alors, tu le veux où ?
- Sur les roues, au K un deux deux.
Le mec est déjà là, ça urge. Merci, Horse.
Mauvaise boîte. Erreur de livraison.
Te casse pas à compter, Butch.
- Je me goure jamais, moi.
- Faut que j'entende.
Entendre, c'est croire.
Dès que tu seras en état de marche,
mon gars te retrouvera dehors.
Ça y est, OK, c'est bon.
Non, le chien.
Tu m'as déjà coûté assez cher.
À plus tard, Butchie.
Ton Avon a pas de muscles.
J'ai bien peur que non.
Tu préfères qui : Ultimate Spiderman
ou Regular Spiderman ?
- C'est quoi la différence ?
- Putain, va tout falloir que je t'apprenne.
Excusez-moi, les gars.
Alors ? Ça va ? Ça te branche la biblio ?
Ça va le faire.
C'est cool pour toi.
Y a un tas de mecs qui voudraient ce travail.
Mais voilà, c'est toi qui l'as eu.
C'est drôle, la vie.
Tu veux que je te dise merci ?
T'es pas obligé de dire quoi que ce soit.
Aie conscience
de ce qui pourrait se passer pour toi
si tu gardes la tête froide.
Ouais, c'est vrai que t'es généreux,
j'avais oublié.
Si tu fermes ta gueule
et que tu ouvres ton esprit,
tu feras qu'une toute petite partie
de tes vingt ans.
Regarde, moi je vais faire quoi, un an,
deux ans peut-être sur sept.
- Tu piges, là ?
- J'ai déjà été condamné.
Au mieux, je gratte la moitié.
Dix ans. Et dix ans, ça fait long à compter.
On a de la poudre qui se ramène,
Dee, OK ? Faut que tu y croies.
Faut que t'aies confiance
et que tu gardes la tête en place.
Putain. Ma tête, elle est là où je veux.
- T'as l'air perdu. Je t'assure.
- Et alors ?
Dis, t'es quoi toi, ma maman ici ou quoi ?
Cool, man, c'est le rôle
de l'homme faible que tu joues là.
Écoute, jamais je t'ai vu aussi faible.
Non, mais des fois, tu sais.
C'est tout ce qui me reste
pour garder la tête au-dessus de ce trou.
T'as pas mieux que ça ? Si t'as pas mieux,
franchement tu déconnes, mon frère.
- Parce que c'est pas si grave que ça.
- C'est ça, c'est pas grave.
Alors, tu vas vendre ?
Je te le demande, mon frère, avec le coeur.
Entre nous, c'est de l'amour, tu le sais.
D'accord. D'accord.
Pendant quelques jours. OK.
Pendant quelques jours.
Ça roule.
Bon, alors ? Qu'est-ce que vous avez ?
Tout numérique.
Quatre mégapixels, seize méga de mémoire.
Zoom optique 3x, zoom numérique 4x.
Pas encore vu sur le marché.
Ouais, la Cadillac des appareils photos.
- Combien ?
- Quatre cents.
- C'est une bien grosse somme.
- C'est normal, c'est Hollywood ce truc.
Bon, moi à cause de toutes ces fonctions
de la marque,
ce que je peux peut-être faire,
c'est trois cent cinquante au détail.
- Ça va. C'est cool.
- Non, c'est pas cool.
Cinq cents. Quoi ?
Ouais, j'ai appelé
les grandes surfaces du coin.
Tu sais, Best Buy, Circuit City.
Ils m'ont dit que ce modèle se vendra facile
à cinq cent cinquante-cinq en solde.
OK. Cinq cents.
- Fois quatre cents exemplaires, ça fait...
- Deux cent mille dollars.
Et tu veux combien ?
Vingt pour cent. On est trois sur le coup.
Je veux que ma femme
ait les chevilles fines.
Mais quand je rentre chez moi,
ce sont les chevilles de ma femme que j'ai.
Huit pour cent. Seize mille dollars.
Ça fait plus de cinq mille
pour toi et tes amis.
Va pour vingt mille. Payé d'avance.
Parce que je t'aime bien.
Comme c'est touchant.
Immortalisons vite cet instant.
Malaka !
Je dois aussi en parler avec mes associés.
S'ils nous suivent,
je prends contact avec toi.
D'accord, c'est cool.
- T'as vu ça ?
- Ouais !
Dis donc, vieux mort, qu'est-ce que
tu mijotes, tu bluffes ou tu bluffes pas ?
- Ta gueule Angie. Tu vois ou tu couches ?
- Eh bien je vais voir et ça va pas être joli.
- C'est combien pour voir ?
- Garde à vous !
Où est le lieutenant ?
Il est dans la rue.
Je n'ai pas l'âme d'un politicien.
Je ne saurais même pas compter les votes.
Alors, c'est que notre temps est venu,
voilà tout.
Tony !
Le sacre n'a pas encore eu lieu, j'espère ?
Je suis désolé. On se voit tout à l'heure.
- Vous m'avez envoyé des tocards.
- Pardon ?
Oui, vous m'avez envoyé des tocards, Ervin.
- Nous en discuterons demain.
- Non, on va en discuter tout de suite
ou je fourre mon nez là-dedans
et je dis à Santoni
de voter contre cette connerie
de couronnement.
Et en plus de ça, j'irai raconter
à quelques-uns de mes amis fidèles
comment s'est terminée l'enquête Barksdale.
Vous voyez de quoi je parle ?
L'affaire à laquelle vous faites allusion
a été couronnée de succès.
Jusqu'à ce que nos hommes
essaient de retrouver le cash.
Nous allons donc entamer notre forum.
Si les membres du Conseil
veulent bien venir s'asseoir.
Je vais vous dire, Burrell.
Il est probable que vous ayez leurs votes,
mais moi j'ai vraiment les moyens
de vous pourrir la vie.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez, Stan ?
Une vraie enquête avec une vraie police
et une vraie unité de commandement.
Très bien. C'est fait.
Donnez-moi le Black,
celui qui a coincé Barksdale.
Daniels y fait de la paperasse.
C'est fini. Il est hors jeu.
Il n'est pas encore à la retraite ?
Je vous conseille d'aller lui parler.
- Je vais voir ce que je peux faire.
- Ne m'emmerdez pas, Erv.
J'ai à la mairie au moins autant d'amis
que vous en avez.
Et avec tout ce que j'ai appris
sur votre putain d'affaire,
j'ai un joli paquet de merde à balancer.
- À diviser en vingt.
- D'accord.
Alors, ça roule, mec ?
- T'as fini avec ton bouquin ?
- Tu peux le lire. Mais je veux qui revienne.
- T'en as donné à Dee ?
- Il en prend pas.
Quatre cents pièces.
Des beaux appareils, Spiros.
Qui les amène ?
Le jeune Niko. Tu sais ?
Et son idiot de cousin,
et je suis sûr qu'il les utilise.
Stephanos.
Tu sais, j'en ai rien à faire de ce crétin.
Écoute. Je leur paie dix cents par dollar
pour les appareils,
et nous on gagne quoi,
cent quatre vingt mille.
- Et Niko, comment il est ?
- Il est bien.
Passe le deal.
Qu'est-ce qui va pas, ce soir ?
- Quoi ?
- Je sais pas, t'as l'air normal.
Tu sais quoi, Dolores ?
J'ai fait de l'argent aujourd'hui.
Oui ? Avec quel bateau ?
Salut, Ziggy.
Donne-moi une bière et un whisky.
Frank Sobotka a dit que j'en avais besoin.
Merci !
- C'est quoi ça ?
- Ta monnaie comme dirait Sobotka.
- Sûr ?
- C'est pas à moi mais pour l'amour du ciel,
prends cet argent
ou quelqu'un d'autre le fera.
Ton papa, c'est un homme bien, petit.
AVOIRS CONJUGAUX
ACCORD DE RÈGLEMENT
Quelqu'un ? Chef ? Chef ?
Appelez un gardien ! Vite !
T.C., qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Une merde ! Allez, qu'est-ce qui arrive ?
- Y tombent tous ! J'en ai vu quatre !
- Quoi ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Mauvaise pioche, man ! Overdose !
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
C'est impressionnant.
Je veux parler du port.
C'est pittoresque, ça c'est sûr.
Chaque matin, je me demande
si c'est bien aujourd'hui que je descends
à Fort Armistead faire mes adieux au port.
Et puis non, en fin de compte j'ai rêvé,
mais avec un peu de chance,
oncle Frank va me téléphoner
et me tirer du lit à sept heures du mate
parce qu'il veut que je traîne mes fesses
jusqu'ici pour une raison mystérieuse.
Un bon mouillage, de bonnes grues,
des voies de chemin de fer près de la 95,
beaucoup de gens prêts à travailler dur.
C'est ma putain de ville.
Mais pour les bateaux
qui viennent de Hampton Road,
on est 110 miles trop loin.
À une journée de route.
À quoi bon venir
si tu sais pas que ta cargaison
circulera en sécurité dans le port ?
Pourquoi décharger à Baltimore
si ce n'est parce qu'une équipe
peut décharger et charger un bateau
plus vite qu'ailleurs
en s'assurant que tout le chargement,
arrive à destination
plus vite que n'importe où ailleurs.
Comme si vous ne voliez jamais rien,
à l'époque.
On n'est pas "à l'époque", Nicky.
C'est quand, la dernière fois
que t'as vu des camions sur 5 km
devant le terminal de Patapsco ?
Sans les bateaux, on serait morts de faim.
Les appareils photo doivent réapparaître.
Je suis sérieux.
Aujourd'hui. On dira à l'affréteur
qu'on avait perdu la caisse sous une pile.
Trop tard. On les a déjà fourgués.
À qui ?
Tu sais que la compagnie Tasco est
à un poil de cul de s'installer à Norfolk.
- C'est pas le moment d'avoir des histoires.
- Je sais, j'ai besoin d'argent.
- T'entends ce que je te dis ?
- Pour moi, tu crois que c'est facile ?
Tu crois que c'est facile ? Essaie de vivre
en bossant cinq ou six jours par mois.
On verra combien de temps tu tiens.
Moi, je tiens plus le coup, oncle Frank.
Si t'as besoin de fric, il faut me demander.
Frankie Sobotka
est le nouveau père Noël des docks.
Il a sûrement les poches pleines.
Tu crois que c'est pour moi ?
C'est ça que tu penses ?
Il s'agit pas de moi, Nick.
Je sais, oui, désolé.
Et tu as mis Ziggy dans le coup Putain Nick,
qu'est-ce que tu as dans la tronche ?
Zig et moi,
on va avoir une petite conversation.
Bon allez, on va bosser.
Combien ?
Deux mille.
- En trois parts.
- Et qui a balancé l'affaire ?
Comment, tu le sais pas ?
Merde alors,
compte pas sur moi pour te rencarder.
Faut pas qu'il y en ait un qui se mette
à claquer le fric. Tu connais la chanson.
SUR ÉCOUTE
"Si vous me prenez par les sentiments..."
- Greggs
Les analyses ont révélé
la présence de strychnine.
Dix à douze pour cent. Plutôt bien mélangé.
Et c'est volontaire ?
Le rapport le dit. Mais dans la rue,
on trouve toujours des drogues coupées.
Avec plein de produits chimiques.
Ainsi on économise la drogue
et on rend ses effets plus puissants.
Les gens commencent à vous prendre
pour un caïd
quand la merde vendue
est coupée avec de la mort aux rats.
Et quand il y en a trop,
les gens tombent comme des mouches.
Soyez gentils de penser
à nos amis journalistes.
Qu'est-ce qui veulent savoir ?
Comment elle est entrée.
Ce qu'on peut faire, le topo.
Elle est entrée comme tout ce qui entre.
Si on ne gagne pas la guerre
contre la drogue dans une prison,
d'après vous,
où est-ce qu'on peut la gagner ?
Écoutez. S'il n'y avait qu'un ou deux morts,
ça se tasserait.
Mais cinq en une nuit
et huit types à l'infirmerie ?
Il va falloir y mettre le holà.
Il va falloir vous montrer compréhensifs.
Comment ça ?
Cette affaire nécessite un informateur.
Et vous allez en trouver des douzaines
à condition d'accorder
des réductions de peine.
Colonel.
- Jimmy.
- Winona.
Gilligan, mon petit pote.
Mais t'as pas de boulot ?
La vache !
Ça sent bon le flic qui bosse.
Si vous le prenez comme ça.
Tu as les papiers trouvés dans le conteneur ?
Une lettre, des enveloppes,
des petits bouts froissés ?
Oui, tout est en bas
avec tes pièces à conviction.
- Tu as le rapport d'enquête ?
- Il l'a.
- Lester.
- Tu veux le presser comme un citron ?
Attends.
Avant que tu en viennes aux choses
sérieuses avec ton inconnue
j'ai besoin que tu me donnes
un petit coup de main sur l'affaire Gant.
J'ai toute la mâchoire d'Ilene Nathan
plantée dans le derrière.
- Pas de problème, je te couvre.
- T'as trouvé Omar ?
Je ne l'ai jamais perdu, mon cher.
- Il a retrouvé Omar ?
- Putain !
Qui c'est, Omar ?
J'ai fait la demande.
Je sais.
Vous voulez partir ? Vous partez.
Mais je vous propose
qu'on efface une ardoise, ici.
- Vous et moi.
- Pourquoi ?
Les élections ont lieu la semaine prochaine,
après je monte à l'étage.
Mais si je veux avoir une chance
de laisser mon empreinte dans ce service,
il me faut des gens bien.
En qui vous ayez confiance.
Ce qui n'est pas votre cas.
D'accord, vous êtes sournois.
Mais vous avez l'air
de connaître votre boulot.
Dans un mois,
je passe mon diplôme d'avocat.
Pourquoi ne pas attendre un an ou deux ?
Et quitter le service
avec une retraite de capitaine ?
Scalise doit prendre sa retraite cet été.
Vous me rendez service
avec cette enquête dans le sud-est.
Et sa place est à vous.
Pourquoi feriez-vous ça ?
Je vous apprécie, Cédric.
Oui, vous êtes arrogant et déloyal.
Mais peut-être qu'avec du temps,
vous apprendrez comment y faire.
- C'est quoi, cette enquête ?
- Affaire de drogue, probablement.
Moi, je crois que Stan Valchek
a un problème personnel
avec quelqu'un d'un des syndicats du port.
Il pense qu'ils ont trop d'argent.
Et comme c'est Valchek,
il monte une enquête.
C'est tout ? C'est maigre.
Je me fiche que vous trouviez un truc
pour Valchek ou non.
Mais je veux que le vieux Polack finisse
en ayant l'impression
d'en avoir eu pour son argent.
Valchek m'a demandé personnellement,
n'est-ce pas ?
Vous faites vos affaires entre vous
et vous avez besoin de moi.
Voici ce que je vous propose.
Si je monte l'enquête,
vous l'assignez de façon permanente
à une unité spéciale
au sein de la brigade criminelle.
C'est raisonnable.
Faites juste en sorte
que Valchek soit content et trouvez-lui
- quelques affaires de drogue.
- Autre chose.
Une promotion et la promesse
d'une unité spéciale, ça ne vous suffit pas ?
Je choisis mes hommes.
Vous ne m'aurez pas deux fois.
- Une fois...
- Faites votre liste.
Passez-la à Rawls.
Il vous donnera qui vous voudrez.
Ça n'a aucun sens.
Certains n'étaient rien du tout.
Tae ? Si lui, c'est un gros bonnet,
ils ne cherchent que des poids plumes.
Dee, tu veux des Surfeurs d'Argent ?
Ils balancent les trucs
que Tae avait dans sa cellule.
Celui qui a coupé la drogue
ne savait pas ce qu'il faisait.
Mon pote de l'infirmerie dit qu'il y avait
plus de mort-aux-rats que de drogue.
Exactement.
PREUVE
Jane Doe, numéro cinq.
Cinq.
Salut, toi.
Pas ici, range ça.
Un whisky et une bière.
T'en as gardé un pour toi, hein ?
Ces Japs font vraiment des appareils super.
- Il y a de la pellicule dans ce truc ?
- Non, c'est numérique.
Je sais que c'est numérique, et alors ?
Il n'y a pas de pellicule, regarde.
Il y a une disquette d'ordinateur.
Tu l'enlèves
et tu transfères les photos sur l'ordinateur.
Merci, Dolo.
Ziggy.
Attends un peu
pour claquer ton blé, d'accord ?
Oui, évidemment.
En fait, à part un nouveau plateau
d'embrayage pour mon carrosse, c'est tout.
- Et ton père est au courant.
- Comment il le sait ?
Horseface nous a vus.
Bordel, il lui a dit ?
Ça fait combien de temps que Horse
connaît ton père ? Bien sûr qu'il lui a dit.
Il est en pétard, Zig. Là, il est vert.
Et qu'est-ce que tu lui as dit ?
Je lui ai dit qu'on avait vendu
les appareils.
Et au bout d'un moment,
il a arrêté de gueuler.
Après toi. Merde.
En tout cas...
c'est profil bas pendant un moment.
D'accord.
Si tu prends une photo avec ça,
pas besoin d'aller chez le photographe
- pour la faire développer ?
- Non, elle va dans l'ordinateur.
Je vais pisser.
J'y vais après toi.
Allez, mon joli. Fais un sourire.
Arrête, Ziggy.
Jimmy, il y a un petit problème
d'emploi du temps.
Sean est invité à l'anniversaire
de Mark Lohrman, samedi.
Tu peux passer le prendre là-bas après 14 h ?
Et en fait, c'est ton week-end,
mais Sean serait triste de ne pas y aller.
Entendu ? Super.
Omar à la fin de la semaine, Jimmy.
Ilene est sur le sentier de la guerre.
Je ne plaisante pas, nom de Dieu.
M. McNulty ? Ici le cabinet du Dr Halpern.
Vous avez oublié
votre séance biannuelle de détartrage
et vous ne nous avez pas prévenus.
Merci de nous rappeler.
McNulty, ici votre chère amie Ilene Nathan.
Si j'ai donné une suite
à cette affaire de merde,
c'est parce que vous m'aviez juré
avoir un témoin ocu...
Vous démarrez à 6 h 38 du matin et nous
avons des rapports qui signalent que...
- Pousse-toi, connard !
- Comment tu me traites ?
Ça, c'est mon côté.
Et quand tu te lèves,
tout le monde doit en faire autant ?
Essuie le siège, Nick,
je sais que t'en as mis partout.
- Je pèterais bien un coup.
- Quelle bonne surprise.
Il n'y a pas de petit-déjeuner, bien sûr ?
Non, je vais le prendre au bar.
Certainement pas. T'as pas le temps.
Faut que tu me déposes chez ma mère
pour récupérer Ashley.
Bouge-toi alors. Tu sais que j'ai du travail
sur un bateau, aujourd'hui.
Ta mère aussi, elle sait que t'as un bateau.
Je monte. Toi, passe par derrière.
Je te prendrai dans le passage derrière,
d'accord ?
Enfin, Nicky,
on a fait un enfant ensemble, non ?
Ça fait quoi qu'on passe la nuit
dans le sous-sol de tes parents ?
Ce sont des gens convenables.
- On n'a pas le temps
- Je sais.
- Alors pourquoi tu me tripotes ?
- Ils me regardaient fixement.
Je te retrouve derrière.
Bon, comment on sort un conteneur
du bateau ? Ou des docks ?
Pour être sûr qu'il aura pas de problème
avec la cargaison,
il faut voir avec un des contrôleurs.
- Qui contrôle ?
- Ce sont des jeunes d'ici.
Ils surveillent tous les chargements
et déchargements,
comparent les bulletins de charge,
complètent la cargaison.
Rien ne peut entrer ou sortir
sans que ce soit inscrit quelque part.
- Ou pas.
- Ou pas.
Donc il faut parler à un contrôleur.
Quoi ?
Noir, blanc, polonais, irlandais, italien,
c'est pareil.
On ne parle pas à la police.
Alors comment vous enquêtez ?
Je patrouille.
Je mets les contraventions.
Quand il y a un conteneur
ouvert ou endommagé,
je fais un rapport.
S'il y a eu un vol, je fais aussi un rapport.
Quand un type reçoit un truc sur la tête
ou se fait rouler dessus par un chargeur,
- je fais une page d'écriture.
- Vous parlez d'un boulot.
Depuis combien de temps ?
- Deux ans.
- Vous faisiez quoi, avant ?
J'étais au péage du tunnel de Fort McHenry.
J'ai le plaisir de vous dire
que c'était loin d'être aussi drôle.
Je me faisais 22 500 $,
je rentrais crevée tous les soirs,
jusqu'au jour où j'ai vu
le tableau des postes à pourvoir.
Agent des autorités portuaires, grade un,
on démarre à 33 000 $ plus les avantages.
Vous avez dit adieu au péage ?
Le père de mes deux enfants
est parti à Houston en 1999.
Depuis trois ans,
il n'a pas donné un coup de fil.
Je pouvais pas m'en sortir avec 22 500 $.
Surtout pas avec deux enfants.
Vous vouliez entrer dans la police ?
J'aurais dû y passer hier soir.
Oui, c'est vrai. Sauf que d'un seul coup
tu te lèves et tu me dis de pas en prendre.
Sauvé par Avon. Comment tu savais ?
Je me doutais bien que tu te pointerais ici
pour me dire merci
de t'avoir sorti de ce merdier.
Cinq morts. Et d'autres à l'infirmerie.
- Comment tu savais ?
- Tu vois, j'ai agi comme un oncle.
Parce que je prends soin
de ta petite personne.
Tu le savais.
Écoute, moi j'ai rien à voir
dans cette histoire,
mais je pourrais bien savoir
qui a fait le coup
C'est pratiquement toi qui diriges
cette taule, qui d'autre ça pourrait être ?
Ce qui compte,
c'est pas ce qui s'est passé, t'entends ?
Ce qui compte,
c'est de pouvoir en tirer un avantage.
Ou tu es le joueur ou tu es le pion.
Je veux savoir si t'es responsable.
Je veux savoir !
Je te l'ai déjà dit.
Si tu me crois pas, va te faire foutre !
Dis-toi que c'est moi qui l'ai coupée,
mais que t'es content d'être toujours là.
Quand tu te seras mis d'accord là-dessus,
on pourra voir comment passer
quelques années de moins ici.
Et pas seulement moi, toi aussi.
À présent, ils cherchent l'enculé
qui a fait entrer cette merde.
Ils veulent le faire tomber.
Et tu sais quoi ?
Je peux te dire qui c'est.
Je peux te donner le vrai nom.
On donne ce nom à n'importe quel gardien,
et on gagne plusieurs années.
Tu piges ?
Alors restez groupés.
Ça se joue à l'intérieur
et ça se joue à l'extérieur,
on a tout prévu.
Je veux plus jamais
tremper dans tes combines. T'as compris ?
Tu ne me mêles pas à tes salades.
Quelles qu'elles soient !
Personne n'a vu Omar ?
On remet ça, les gars.
Six bateaux dans la journée.
Il n'y a pas eu autant de trafic au terminal
depuis des mois, ça fait du bien.
Fait chier. Voilà le petit merdeux.
- Putain, c'est quoi, ça ?
- Du cuir italien, qu'est-ce que tu crois ?
En plein hiver et en plein milieu des docks ?
- Combien ça coûte, ta saloperie ?
- Deux sacs.
Tout ça pour un manteau ?
T'as pas un peu pété les plombs, Zig ?
Rien à foutre.
2 000 $ pour un putain de manteau à la con.
Nom de Dieu, Zig,
t'es pas net, faut te faire soigner.
Ça alors, j'imaginais qu'un Afro-américain
tel que toi comprendrait
qu'un joueur de ma classe ait besoin
de suivre de très près la dernière mode,
mais apparemment, toi,
tu n'as aucun style non plus.
- J'y vais à pieds, OK ?
- Salut.
Quoi ?
Je t'ai pas dit que c'était pas le moment
d'étaler le fric ?
Mais enfin, bordel, Nicky,
c'est jamais qu'un manteau, après tout.
Je peux toujours dire aux gars
que je me le paie à crédit ou n'importe quoi.
Mais reconnais au moins qu'aujourd'hui,
je suis vachement élégant.
Je t'assure.
Les Grecs voudraient nous parler.
Nous parler de quoi ?
On s'est bien débrouillés.
Mais bon Dieu, Zig,
essaie de te tenir à carreau,
sinon bientôt on parlera plus que de nous
sur les docks, t'as compris ?
Bon d'accord, pas de problème
- Salut.
- Salut.
Yo, jette ce que t'as sur toi.
Messieurs.
Non, c'est pas la peine.
- T'as dit quoi ?
- J'en ai rien à foutre de la drogue.
Les saletés par terre, ça me fait chier,
alors t'iras ramasser ta merde.
Bon alors, je cherche un gars armé
qui s'appelle Omar.
Mince, la peau très noire
avec une cicatrice sur la joue droite.
Quand on l'a vu une fois, on s'en souvient.
Il se trimballe avec un flingue
à peu près long comme ça.
Il vous le colle sur la tempe
et il vous pique votre dope sans y penser.
Alors vous ne savez pas où il traîne ?
Qui il voit ?
Ou dans quelle voiture il roule ?
Allez vous faire foutre !
Le deuxième paquet est arrivé.
Elle est moins forte,
on pourra pas autant la couper.
Saleté de drogue d'Atlanta,
elle est plus chère et elle est moins bonne.
Elle est pure à 25 pour cent.
On peut juste la mélanger et faire les doses.
Et perdre du fric ?
Moi, je perds du fric.
Coupe cette saloperie.
À combien ?
Je sais pas, 10 pour cent.
- C'est déjà de la merde.
- Je sais, bordel.
Le conteneur en lui-même nous mène
nulle part. Les deux adresses sont fausses.
Nous devons donc nous intéresser au port.
car ce qui a mal tourné sur ce bateau
était sans doute connu de celui
qui devait venir chercher ce conteneur.
Ce qui explique
qu'il soit toujours sur le quai.
En conclusion, il faut en savoir plus sur
les cargaisons qui partent par ce terminal,
sur la nature du trafic
et sur la façon dont il est dissimulé.
Ma conclusion à moi est différente.
Ma conclusion à moi
est que vous auriez dû retenir ce bateau.
Car c'est le lieu du crime,
pour les témoins et pour l'affaire.
Les témoins ne savaient...
Je me fous qu'ils parlent le mandarin
en zézayant comme un travelo,
ils auraient dû voir une salle
d'interrogatoire car l'affaire, c'est eux.
Nous étions à Philadelphie
sans autorité judiciaire
compétente pour les étrangers,
et on n'avait pas de motif évident.
Moi, les gars, tout ce que je peux vous dire,
c'est à quoi ça ressemble vu de ma fenêtre.
De ma fenêtre, je vois deux de mes
inspecteurs qui enculent les mouches.
Treize meurtres. Quatorze si on compte
la baigneuse et ce sont toutes des cocos.
Que voulez-vous que je vous dise ?
Si on ne résout pas cette affaire,
on va tous bouffer notre chapeau
pour expliquer ce qui s'est passé.
Alors faites comme bon vous semble.
Il faut me comprendre.
Si je dois livrer à Burrell
un ou deux boucs émissaires,
j'ai ce qu'il me faut.
Putain !
PETIT JOHNNY
RESTAURANT & COMMANDES À EMPORTER
Bon. De quoi vous vouliez nous parler ?
Si vous vous en sortez aussi bien, il y a
d'autres choses qui nous seront utiles.
Quel genre ?
Non, en fait, on a un peu foutu le bordel
en fauchant comme ça les appareils photos.
Quand on a de la marchandise très chère
comme ça, il faut attendre que ça se tasse.
Nous ne cherchons pas
la même marchandise.
Non ?
Acétone, acide sulfurique,
permanganate de potassium.
- Des produits chimiques ?
- Comme des solvants à peinture, ce genre.
Pour quoi faire ? Pourquoi ne pas acheter
tout ça dans un magasin de bricolage ?
Non. Il nous en faut beaucoup.
Plusieurs tonnes. Cinq ou dix tonnes.
Vérifiez. Vous verrez, on fabrique ça, ici.
C'est expédié d'ici,
des citernes entières sur vos quais.
Et ça, ça paie bien.
Combien ?
Combien de produit ?
Deux tonnes ? Quatre ?
- Huit ?
- Je vais étudier ça.
Yo, Bubbles !
McNulty.
L'homme que je préfère.
Monte en voiture.
Où était passé mon vieux ?
Qu'est-ce que t'as acheté ? Un walkman.
Tu sais comment ça marche, Bubs.
Il va falloir payer l'impôt là-dessus.
Imposition sans représentation.
Tu connais ?
Je demande pas grand-chose, il me faut Omar.
Omar le barge ?
Tu voudrais qu'on se balade
dans toute la ville
à la recherche d'un malade armé d'un fusil ?
On se connaît depuis longtemps, lui et moi.
C'est amical.
Si c'est amical,
t'as pas besoin de nous pour le retrouver.
Pas de problème, tu me montres le ticket
de ce truc et tu es quitte.
- Tiens.
- Garde-le, c'est mes impôts.
Ton impôt, c'est Omar.
Je veux de tes nouvelles vendredi, Bubs.
Merde !
Mon client fournira des informations exactes
sur l'origine de la drogue trafiquée.
Il identifiera la façon
dont le produit illicite a été introduit
dans l'établissement
ainsi que les coupables.
Les racontars de cellule ne valent rien.
Je vous donnerai les éléments
pour une procédure,
- si c'est bien ça qui vous intéresse.
- Vos conditions ?
La liberté conditionnelle de mon client
sera jugée dans 28 mois.
Nous voulons ramener ce délai à un an.
Et avoir l'assurance
du soutien de l'administration
pour une libération conditionnelle anticipée.
Un an sur une peine de sept ans ?
Nous proposons une coopération
considérable dans cette affaire.
M. Barksdale prend des risques sérieux
en fournissant des informations
impliquant des détenus
et du personnel pénitentiaire.
Et je voudrais ajouter que la peine
que purge M. Barksdale est la première.
Ce n'est pas un récidiviste.
Il me semble qu'un officier de police a été
tué en enquêtant sur vos affaires, Barksdale.
- Non, monsieur.
- Vous avez oublié ?
Je me souviens qu'un policier a été tué.
Et je me souviens en avoir été affecté.
Pas seulement car un policier était mort,
mais parce que ça voulait dire
plus de policiers sur mon dos.
Je me suis dit : "Chaque fois qu'un con
fait un truc idiot comme de tuer un policier,
"c'est mauvais pour tous."
Vous et moi, nous savons
que mon nom n'a jamais été mêlé
à ce qui est arrivé à votre amie.
Je trouve nos demandes raisonnables
compte tenu des circonstances.
Après tout, tant que personne n'aura
découvert l'origine de l'héroïne trafiquée,
on pourra encore avoir
cinq overdoses, demain.
Ou le lendemain.
Réfléchissez à notre offre.
Mais à notre prochaine rencontre,
nous voulons que l'assistant d'un procureur
soit présent.
Du thon du pêcheur ?
T'exagères, maman, aujourd'hui,
j'ai crapahuté sur deux bateaux.
Il n'y a pas un menu spécial,
un jour comme ça ?
- Où est papa ?
- Il est au bar avec ses chevaux.
Dis-lui qu'on mange.
- On gagne, papa ?
- Nicko.
T'es gagnant, en général ?
Ça marchait bien et puis cette année,
Gulfstream me gâche la vie.
Vas-y mollo, c'est mon héritage.
Au bout de 25 ans,
je gagne toujours d'environ 7 000 $.
Papa, tu devrais me laisser t'emmener
à Pimlico quand ce sera ouvert.
On essaierait ton truc pour de bon.
Trop tentant.
Juste une fois.
J'ai vu que le Cape Spruance
relâche à Pointe Ouest.
Oui. On l'a déchargé aujourd'hui.
On lui avait fait deux voies d'eau.
Au quai numéro 4.
Peut-être deux ans
avant que le bassin de radon ne soit fermé.
Il flotte toujours ?
Évidemment qu'il flotte.
Est-ce que ça te manque, papa ?
Ça n'arrangerait rien.
Qu'est-ce qu'on mange ?
Thon du pêcheur.
Vous êtes fidèle à vos hommes,
voilà au moins une chose que je respecte.
Pas de souci, lieutenant.
Burrell veut que vous meniez ce groupe
et moi aussi.
Il me faut votre accord
pour Freamon, Greggs et Hauk.
- Ils sont de la Criminelle.
- Vous faites erreur.
Il vous faut mon accord pour tout le monde
Valchek est peut-être à son origine,
mais ce groupe d'enquête sera
sous l'autorité de la Brigade Criminelle.
Du moment qu'ils travaillent pour moi,
il leur faut mon accord.
La bonne nouvelle, c'est que je ne fais
aucune réserve à votre liste.
Sauf pour McNulty. Pas McNulty.
Rien qui ressemble de près ou de loin
à cet enfoiré.
- À ce point-là ?
- Soit il se tire, soit il se noie.
Il n'y a pas d'autre moyen pour lui
de quitter le navire et que Dieu m'entende.
Vous connaissez
l'objectif de ce groupe, lieutenant ?
Un différend qui concerne Valchek.
Deux connards de Polacks
qui se chient dans les bottes.
Je suis au courant.
N'importe quoi pourvu que vous sortiez
de votre trou à rats, lieutenant ?
Salut, les filles.
Non, Kima, on s'en fiche.
On y sera dans 5 mn et ils resteront
de pauvres petits merdeux de la fac.
Il faut que tu commences à te demander
ce que ferait un avocat.
Qu'est-ce qu'il dirait, un avocat ?
Maître Shakima Greggs.
C'est bien de toi dont je parle. Arrête.
- Tire ton cul de là, petit con !
- Ta gueule, madame.
Je suis pas une dame.
- Tu démarres ou c'est moi qui conduis ?
- Avance, fichons le camp.
Seuls les plus racés peuvent accomplir
ce parcours en obéissant avec tant de coeur.
Une obéissance propre aux champions
et pas que dans les expositions canines.
Regardez ces allures de tigre. La troisième
génération de champions de Glassport.
Même des animaux domestiques ne sachant
pas qu'ils avaient du sang de champion.
Pour figurer à ce niveau,
un animal doit obéir aux ordres
sans poser de questions.
Ce n'est pas de l'instinct.
Monte.
Tous les chiens ont de l'instinct.
On n'a pas ça ici. Presque tous les produits
chimiques sont au terminal de Fairfield.
On connaît quelqu'un à Fairfield ?
Le beau-frère d'Ott y travaille.
Faut le contacter.
Pourquoi ils veulent tous ces produits,
au fait ?
- Moi, ça me dépasse.
- Max, qu'est-ce que tu as ?
- Merde, Ziggy, désolé.
- Putain, Maui, tu fais chier.
Je suis désolé, j'avais pas vu que t'étais là
avec ton beau cuir.
- Mais qu'est-ce qui te prend, bordel ?
- Je suis maladroit, c'est tout.
Mais t'as qu'à aller voler
un bidon de lait pour bébé
et comme ça, tu pourras te nettoyer.
Trou du cul !
Connard.
Merde, lieutenant, j'avais promis.
Vous croyez que ma chère et tendre
va me sauter au cou quand elle va savoir ?
- J'allais passer la porte.
- Vous ne connaissez pas Cheryl.
Vous ne connaissez pas Marla.
Écoutez, si vous êtes d'accord,
on pourrait vous infiltrer
comme avec Prez l'année dernière.
Évidemment, si vous me prenez
par les sentiments...
Je le dirai à votre femme
si vous le dites à la mienne.
Dans la voiture, mais pas en évidence.
Rock.
Sois subtil sur ce coup.
- Tu comprends, subtil ?
- Ça veut dire cool.
Bonne musique, papa ?
Merci pour les écouteurs.
Tu comprends, Bubs, je veux dire...
Si tu te mets à soulever des rochers,
- tu vas être mordu par un serpent, non ?
- Sais pas.
Faut payer l'impôt, Johnny.
Je veux dire, un flic qui bosse,
il a droit à quelque chose.
- Alors Bee bosse pour Lamar.
- Tout le monde bosse pour Lamar.
Tout ce qu'il y a dans le quartier,
c'est pour sa pomme.
Et sa planque est dans les petits immeubles
de l'autre côté de la rue ?
Dans la deuxième cour.
Tout est dans l'appartement
avec les fenêtres cachées par des planches.
À partir du coin, c'est quelle porte ?
Troisième.
Papa.
On n'a pas un tuyau sur la bête sauvage ?
Celle qui aime jouer du fusil.
- Omar ?
- Oui, il me faut Omar.
Qu'est-ce que tu lui veux, à Omar ?
Je veux juste lui dire un mot.
Juste un mot.
Si tu veux trouver Omar,
t'as qu'à t'installer au coin d'une rue
avec un bon gros coussin sur le cul.
Tu le verras bien assez tôt, ce nègre.
Tu sens quelque chose ?
Viens, on se tire.
Allez, viens.
Comme convenu, nous coopérerons
si le juge des libertés conditionnelles
accepte de ramener la première audition
de M. Barksdale à dans 12 mois
et prend en considération
sa coopération dans cette affaire.
On ne base pas une instruction
sur des ragots de taulards.
On veut la drogue sur la table.
Bien entendu.
Si, avant la fin de son service aujourd'hui,
on fouille le véhicule,
Le casier
et la personne du gardien Tilghman,
nous assurons que vous trouverez
suffisamment de preuves.
"Nous assurons" ?
L'administration pénitentiaire
étant en cause, l'accord est équitable,
s'il règle la question des overdoses.
Mais si nous revenons bredouilles...
Non.
Je parie à deux contre un.
C'est ce fils de pute qui a trafiqué la dope.
Vous pouvez le prouver ?
Dans ce cas, nous allons instruire
avec ce que nous avons.
CAP. VALCHEK - POLICE DE BALTIMORE
Jésus, Marie, Joseph. La Nouvelle-Orléans.
Lieutenant.
- Bienvenue au secteur sud-est.
- Je crois que vous m'avez demandé.
Lieutenant, mon gendre
ne tarit pas d'éloges sur vous.
Il faut dire que vous lui avez
bien rendu service, l'année dernière.
- Vous voulez me parler de cette affaire ?
- Frank Sobotka
Un syndicaliste, un docker.
Cet enfoiré étale de l'argent, beaucoup.
Mes gars parlent d'un trafic de drogue.
Je peux aussi vous garantir
comme un fait certain que ses hommes
sont capables de soulever et de voler
tout ce qui n'est pas en sécurité.
- Vous avez vu les lieux ?
- Pas encore.
J'ai donné rendez-vous à mes hommes ici,
au commissariat.
Bien organisé. Venez, je vous montre.
C'est une jeune femme qui écrit à sa mère.
Ou en tout cas à une femme plus âgée.
Elle ne mentionne aucun nom ?
Il y a une Anya, ici.
Et avec la façon qu'elle écrit,
je peux deviner que c'est une enfant.
C'est presque prêt, mon père. Excusez-moi.
- Et elle écrit à qui ?
- Il n'y a pas de nom.
La lettre est pour toute la famille.
Mais oui.
Elle a signé "Nadya." Elle s'appelle Nadya.
- Nadya.
- Elle a des ennuis ?
Elle est morte.
Et il n'y a rien dans la lettre
qui pourrait indiquer où vivent ces gens ?
- Si vous aviez l'enveloppe, je pourrais...
- Non.
La seule chose précise dont elle parle,
c'est d'une église,
Saint-Volodymyr ou Saint-Vladimir.
Et d'un prêtre.
- Le père Vasyl, elle écrit.
- Il n'y a pas de lieu, pas de noms de gens
De l'autre côté de l'océan,
père Vasyl est un nom courant.
Et il y a beaucoup de Saint-Volodymyr.
Mais laissez la lettre. Je vais essayer.
Merci.
Je dis juste que si y a pas assez de travail,
tu pourrais faire autre chose, c'est tout.
Mais il y a assez de travail.
En fait, on m'a remboursé
de l'argent qu'on m'avait emprunté,
il y a un mois environ.
Ça fait 2 000 $
qui venaient des congés payés.
Arrête, Ash.
Je me disais...
On devrait peut-être se trouver un appart.
Avec quoi tu le paierais ?
Et peut-être qu'il faut pas louer.
Peut-être qu'on devrait essayer
d'acheter dans le coin,
un truc pas trop grand.
Il paraît que la baraque
de tante Treesey à Covington
avait été bien retapée,
avec du parquet et tout. Ash.
C'est quoi, le bateau là, à droite ?
- Un câblier.
- Et c'est quoi, le gris qui est à côté ?
Un transport militaire.
T'es géniale.
T'as pas froid ?
- Dwight ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Nous allons devoir
fouiller votre voiture. Désolé.
Fouiller ? Ça va pas ?
Ouvrez-la, sinon je vais forcer la serrure
et peut-être l'endommager.
Vous n'avez pas le droit
de me traiter comme ça !
- Aucun droit, sans mandat !
- Ceci est une administration pénitentiaire,
vous reconnaissez
que le véhicule peut être fouillé.
Où est la clef, Dwight ?
Il va rentrer de déjeuner
dans une minute, Zig.
T'as compris ? S'il te trouve là,
il va te réduire en poudre
et te vendre au détail.
La voilà.
C'est un coup monté.
Et par vous, vous le savez très bien.
- C'est quoi, les sifflets ?
- C'est pour nous.
Oui, ils nous ont signalés
quand on est descendus de voiture.
- C'est lui.
- Alors c'est lui. Horseface ?
- D'où il vient ce surnom ?
- Attendez de le voir de près.
Thomas Pakusa.
Nous avons besoin de vous parler.
Quoi ?
C'est vous qui avez contrôlé
l'Atlantic Light, il y a 15 jours ?
C'est bien possible.
Vous vous souvenez du conteneur
déchargé ce jour-là ?
- Avec les cadavres des filles.
- Non.
Vous ne vous souvenez pas
des filles mortes dans le conteneur ?
Horse, voyons.
Je me rappelle que vous les avez trouvées
dans un empilage,
mais sûrement pas
qu'elles venaient de l'Atlantic Light.
Très bien, on va faire un petit tour en ville
et tirer ça au clair.
Non.
Vous, montez dans la voiture.
- Vous m'arrêtez ?
- Dans la voiture, c'est un ordre.
Si vous voulez que je monte,
il faut m'arrêter.
Et si c'est comme ça, il faut
que je parle à mon délégué du personnel.
Je veux
qu'un avocat du syndicat m'accompagne.
Tiens, salut papa.
Arrête, papa, j'ai rien fait.
Un petit sourire ?
Tu me fais encore un coup comme ça, Zig,
je te retire ta carte,
et tant pris pour ta mère.
Fous-moi le camp d'ici !
Plutôt coquet pour un petit gros,
vous trouvez pas ?
Nom de Dieu, Ziggy,
faut aller te faire soigner.
Viens enlever la queue de mon ordinateur !
Où sont les inspecteurs
qui avaient été désignés ?
Morts. Pour moi, en tout cas.
J'ai réexpédié ces bras cassés à Burrell
aussi vite que possible.
Vous êtes en retard.
Ça, c'est ce qu'il y a de bien
avec ce service.
N'importe quel tocard
retombe toujours sur ses pieds.
- Comment ça va, mon vieux ?
- Ça va, et toi ?
Super, merci.
Où est Lester ? Il vient avec nous, non ?
Aujourd'hui, il est encore avec la Crim.
Raul a promis de lui annoncer
la mauvaise nouvelle demain.
Mais pas à McNulty.
McNulty, ils le détestent vraiment.
Et c'est pas un reproche.
Roland restera avec vous
le temps qu'il faudra.
Et s'il vous faut quelqu'un
du secteur sud-est, demandez.
Bien, je vous laisse travailler.
Carver est au sud-est, maintenant.
Sur le secteur 2, je crois.
Ce serait sympa de l'avoir là-dessus, non ?
Sur quoi ?
On ne sait même pas après quoi on court, ici.
Sans vouloir offenser votre beau-père,
les indices sont maigres.
Puisqu'on est là, quoi qu'il arrive, on suit
le programme pendant quelques semaines.
On réglera peut-être
une ou deux affaires de drogue.
En tout cas, ça fera chier la Criminelle.
Lui et cette nana, ils ont une fille.
Mais elle est muette.
Sa femme est pas contente
et elle le lui reproche.
Alors lui, il élève la fille.
Elle, elle a ses règles,
elle panique et elle va le voir.
Il pense qu'elle a été violée...
C'est le jackpot.
T'as vu ? Ça, ça vaut 10 $ au poids du métal.
On trouve comment le traîner
chez le ferrailleur et on est bons.
Putain, on va se casser les reins
avec ce machin.
Johnny, Johnny, on va y arriver.
Écoute, j'essaie de t'apprendre la vie, là.
D'accord ?
Tu vois, ça tombe à pic.
Là, il y en a pour 10 $.
Bubs la balance.
Il paraît que tu me cherches ?
Les écouteurs sont super.
Je vais m'en servir pour la gym. Merci.
- Ce sont les garçons ?
- Non. C'est très calme, là-haut.
Un peu trop calme.
Ça veut dire qu'ils doivent être
en train de jouer aux jeux vidéo.
Ou avec une boîte d'allumettes.
Et est-ce que tu as montré les papiers
à un avocat ?
C'est fait.
- Alors ?
- Il dit que je ne devrais pas signer.
Il dit que je fais trop de concessions.
Qu'en aucun cas
je ne paierais autant d'indemnités
et de pension alimentaire
si on allait au tribunal.
Ça, c'est ce qu'il dit ?
Signés et enregistrés.
Je ne veux pas me battre pour l'argent.
Je veux qu'on revive ensemble.
Oui.
Yo, String. Regarde si j'ai été subtil.
L'enquête a conduit à la mise en accusation
pour deal de trois détenus,
l'un d'eux ayant été victime
de la drogue trafiquée,
et d'un gardien de prison
depuis dix dans l'établissement.
Le directeur
de l'administration pénitentiaire
et le secrétaire d'État
à la Sécurité publique
m'ont demandé de vous annoncer
que la peine maximum serait requise
contre ce gardien...
J'ai un partiel. Il faut que je révise.
- C'est là que ça se passe ?
- C'est quoi, l'idée ?
Qu'il est temps qu'ils se rendent compte
qu'on n'est pas près de laisser tomber.
Tu vas pas nous mettre
de cette saleté de country !
J'ai horreur de cette merde de country.
Non, même chantée par Ray Charles,
pour moi, c'est toujours aussi mauvais.
Non, monsieur.
Big Daddy Lipscomb jouait ailier droit.
T'as la mémoire en compote, Jessy.
Ailier gauche.
Tu faisais encore dans ta culotte. Comment
t'aurais reconnu ta droite de ta gauche ?
Va traîner au resto de Schula
si tu veux vraiment apprendre.
Salut, chérie.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Rien, on est juste venus passer une heure
ou deux, après quoi, on s'en ira.
Et toi, alors ?
Je m'en vais après celui-là.
Vous êtes de la police du port ?
J'en reconnais pas un seul.
- Brigade Criminelle.
- Criminelle ?
- Qui a été tué ?
- Des filles dans un conteneur.
C'était un accident. Un sacré accident.
En tout cas, c'est ce qu'on m'a dit.
Excusez-moi.
C'est lui.
Il a que 290 $.
À quoi tu joues, Frog ?
Quand on deale un gros paquet,
c'est censé rapporter au moins 500 $.
On a eu de la fauche.
Qu'est-ce que c'est que ces conneries ?
Je veux mon fric.
Fais gaffe, je rigole pas, espèce d'enculé.
C'est comme ça que tu te la joues ?
D'accord.
Demain matin, je repasse par ici
et t'as intérêt à avoir le fric.
Sinon, tu vas voir.
Tu vas voir à qui t'as à faire.
Pour qui tu me prends ? Pour une fiotte ?
Tiens, le môme,
va au coin me chercher un soda
et un paquet de chips au crabe.
Les trous du cul, c'est quoi,
votre problème ?
Merde, merde ça craint, fait chier !
Merde, ça craint.
Merde.
Sors de la voiture.
Tu sors de là, putain !
Ta gueule !
Où t'as mis le fric ?
Fais voir ce que t'as là-dessous.
T'as bien quelque chose pour moi,
Zig, hein ?
T'as du fric pour moi, hein, raclure ?
Bingo.
Attends un peu,
c'est pas ça que j'appelle du fric, moi,
enfoiré. Là, il y a pas assez.
T'énerve pas, Cheese, je m'en occupe.
C'est mes gars, tu sais...
Quoi ? Mais putain, à quoi tu joues, toi ?
Mais tu crois que c'est toi
qui décides comment ça marche ? Hein ?
C'est ça que tu crois, petit merdeux ?
Bordel. Espèce d'enculé, ça fait mal.
Je sais, c'est fait exprès.
Ça va, ça va, écoute.
Tu prends mon manteau, tiens, vas-y.
C'est un manteau que j'ai payé 2 000 $.
Alors, ça plus le liquide que je t'ai donné
et si je te donne encore 700 $
à la fin de la semaine.
Je te jure, tu les auras.
Je sais, c'est rien, ça se répare.
Tu le fais réparer.
2 000 $ ?
Pour ça ?
C'est pas une sape pour un noir, le machin.
Tu te rends pas compte, toi.
Ben, qu'est-ce qui te fait marrer ?
Mais non. Je sais pas, du calme.
Ça va, t'auras ton fric vendredi
et tu verras bien
qu'il y avait pas de quoi en faire un plat.
Écoute bien. Si tu me payes pas vendredi,
je te jure que samedi, t'es mort.
Prends sa caisse.
Mais j'en ai besoin, putain.
Putain, j'en ai besoin.
Je t'emmerde !
SUR ÉCOUTE
"Ils faisaient de l'acier ici,
dans le temps ?" - Spiros Vondas
Pourquoi moi ?
Si vous refusez,
je prendrai quelqu'un d'autre.
Valchek m'offre le gratin de son secteur.
Je n'ai pas dit que je n'étais pas candidat.
Je vous demande pourquoi moi,
après ce qui s'est passé la dernière fois.
Oui, je me le suis dit aussi.
En étudiant l'organigramme
du quartier Sud-Est,
je me suis posé la question :
"Pourquoi j'irais prendre
un type qui m'a déjà roulé ?
"Qui s'est déjà montré malhonnête ?"
Alors, pourquoi je le ferais ?
J'en ai pas la moindre idée, lieutenant.
Parce que s'il m'a eu une fois,
ce serait bien le dernier des salauds
d'essayer de recommencer.
Et j'imagine
que vous en avez suffisamment honte
pour que ça ne se reproduise plus.
Oui, c'est vrai.
Une chose encore.
Pour moi, ces galons sur votre uniforme
ne sont pas mérités.
Votre feuille de paye dit
que vous êtes sergent, mais dans ce groupe,
c'est l'inspecteur Greggs
qui sera votre chef.
Comme ça a toujours été.
Bon, alors ?
Je suis pris.
La petite salope.
Fils de p...
Lâche-moi la grappe, pédé.
Je l'ai joint par radio.
Il sera là dans peu de temps.
Merci, monsieur l'agent. Belle journée.
Un Lucifer 450.
La Rolls des barbecues.
Le voilà.
POLICE FLUVIALE
VÉHICULES D'URGENCE
Bubs !
McNulty, marin d'eau douce, hein ?
Attention, attention devant !
Tiens. Attache ça sur le machin, là,
tu veux ?
Le taquet ? T'y connais vraiment rien.
Regarde-moi ça.
Je sais pas, peut-être que c'est moi,
mais quand je vois ça,
je me dis : "Cherchez l'erreur."
Et ça, c'est quoi ?
Un noeud de Baltimore.
Et c'est comment, un noeud de Baltimore ?
Je sais pas, en tous cas,
c'est jamais pareil.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux que je te dise ?
C'est plus moi, l'inspecteur.
Et pourquoi, bon Dieu,
tu voulais que je retrouve Omar ?
C'est une vieille histoire.
Tu te souviens de Bird ?
Son procès a lieu la semaine prochaine
et Omar doit témoigner.
Il a dit que tu pouvais le joindre
à ce numéro
ou laisser un message.
Beau boulot, Bubs.
Comme toujours. Tiens.
Pour le taxi.
Tu dis donnant-donnant, et les petits casses
à droite à gauche, on les oublie.
Mais j'ai réfléchi, tu sais,
il faut que tu te rendes compte
de ce que c'est ce que tu m'as demandé.
Je veux dire c'est quoi ça, merde ?
Je suis pas là pour poser la question
au hasard, qui a vu ce foutu négro ?
Non, monsieur, je veux dire,
je fais une enquête en ton nom.
Et en plus, sur le compte de cet enculé
de nègre féroce, mon vieux Omar.
Quoi ? Il t'a pris la tête ?
Moi, je l'ai joué respect
et lui, il m'a collé sa saleté de flingue
sous le nez, mon vieux.
C'était comme si j'avais
les deux putains de tunnels du port
qui me regardaient.
Ils étaient aussi gros que ça.
Moi, j'ai failli pisser dans mon froc,
et lui il se marrait comme si c'était drôle.
C'est pas drôle.
McNulty, je sais
que je dois payer pour des trucs.
Mais là, je crois que ça mérite mieux qu'un :
"Beau boulot, Bubs" et un billet, putain !
Pour ta peine.
Où on en est avec les non-identifiées ?
On s'intéresse de près au port.
On va convoquer devant le grand jury,
tous les dockers qui ont travaillé
sur le bateau. On va secouer le cocotier.
Comment s'en tire
la nana de la police du port ?
Elle connait bien les docks.
Pourtant, elle est pas inspecteur.
Alors, il vous faut des troupes fraîches.
Cole ou bien Massey, le premier du tableau.
Et vous, vous filez sur le champ au Sud-Est.
Vous êtes momentanément détaché.
Colonel, avec le respect que je vous dois,
est-ce que vous me virez
sans me laisser la moindre possibilité
de résoudre cette affaire ?
Soyons clairs, inspecteur Freamon.
Quand je voudrai vous virer, vous le saurez.
Vous en serez tellement sûr
que vous ne vous poserez pas la question.
Quant à vous, inspecteur Moreland,
vous vous retrouverez seul avec 14 cocos.
Quel effet ça fait ?
Et le stationnement derrière,
ça n'a pas de prix à Federal Hill.
D'en haut, on a vue sur le port ?
Oui, avec une double exposition.
Allez-y, montez.
Vous verrez, ça va vous plaire.
- C'est pas Federal Hill.
- Je vous demande pardon ?
On est à la Pointe. La Pointe de Locust.
Si on considère le découpage immobilier,
tout ce qui se trouve sous Montgomery Street
et jusqu'à la côte s'appelle Federal Hill.
Vous cherchez une maison ?
On débute nos recherches.
Si le quartier vous intéresse, je vous
donnerai une liste de biens à vendre.
- Cette maison...
- Était à ma Tante Treesey.
Votre tante, vraiment ?
C'est une parente des McDonald ?
Non. C'est une parente à moi.
Elle est morte il y a environ quatre ans.
Et la famille a vendu juste après.
Est-ce que c'est son prix ?
Sur le descriptif ? Oui.
Ils n'en tireront pas ce prix-là ?
Eh bien, je ne peux pas en jurer.
Mais la semaine dernière,
il s'en est vendu une tout à fait semblable,
340 000 $.
340 000 $ ?
- Merci.
- De rien.
On devrait peut-être louer.
On est là
parce que Valchek nous a réclamés.
Parce qu'il pense que ce type
avec son syndicat minable
dépense trop d'argent.
Donc pour commencer, Freamon et toi,
vous allez mettre sur écoute
les lignes du siège du syndicat.
Contrôlez les finances du syndicat
et les comptes personnels de Sobotka.
On fait ça vite. Une copie au commandant
pour montrer qu'on est sur le coup
et on laisse venir.
Pendant ce temps-là, vous trois,
vous nous montrez vos talents.
Vous trouvez où les gars du port
achètent leur dope le vendredi soir
et vous vous infiltrez.
Peut-être qu'il faut dealer.
On dirait qu'il y a beaucoup de blancs
chez ces gars-là.
Et chez les dealers
des quartiers Sud-Est, aussi.
Ce qui veut dire
qu'il va vous falloir un blanc
pour s'intégrer
à certains secteurs du Sud-Est.
Donc, on met Kima et Carv sur les toits
et c'est mon tour d'aller au mastic.
Je vais vous apprendre le boulot.
L'impassible Lester.
Tiens, tiens ! Qu'est-ce qui t'amène ?
Les mêmes bras cassés
dans le même groupe d'enquête à la noix
et dans des locaux
toujours aussi merdiques.
Vous manquez d'ambition personnelle,
je trouve.
C'est une affectation provisoire.
Rawls te récupère à la fin de l'enquête.
S'il veut de moi.
Je suis tout en haut de sa liste noire.
- Alors, on vous rend service.
- Je n'irais pas jusque là.
Mais bon, qui est le lièvre ?
Frank Sobotka ?
- La vache, il est fort !
- Vous le connaissez ?
Bunk Moreland et moi,
on est allés l'asticoter
pour l'enquête
sur les filles mortes dans le conteneur.
Vous avez des soupçons ?
Non. Mais il est sûrement au courant
de ce qui se trame sur le port.
- Pourquoi lui ?
- Parce que mon beau-père le déteste.
Ce qui, dans le quartier Sud-Est,
est une raison suffisante.
Valchek pense qu'il a trop d'argent.
Et vous pensez drogue ?
Tu connais d'autres crimes
dans cette putain de ville ?
J'aurais bien voulu venir plus tôt.
Seulement, Terrell a été malade et tout.
Mais tu sais, Dee,
on nous paye tout ce qu'il nous faut.
Quand tu reviendras chez nous,
Stringer a dit qu'il te caserait
dans un truc peinard.
Comme diriger une boîte
ou un boulot réglo comme ça.
Stringer dit que tu seras peinard
et que tu auras plus de temps
pour ta famille.
Pour toi et moi, et Terrell.
La famille, hein ?
Ils réfléchissent comment faire pour toi.
Et ils font tous ces projets
malgré que t'as pas été très cool
avec ton oncle.
C'est ce que dit Stringer, en tout cas.
Mais pourquoi t'as fait ça ?
Les jeter alors qu'eux,
ils cherchent à t'aider ?
Ils se paient ta tête avec : "On est
une famille et tout ça, c'est de l'amour."
C'est leur façon de faire.
Quand ils auront plus besoin de toi,
la famille, il en sera plus question.
Ils font des affaires, Donette.
Dee, ils seront là pour nous aider.
Stony, tu veux un baiser de la mort ?
- Je sais que Stony l'aime bien.
- Cours pas si vite, minable.
Je te répète qu'il faut que t'en achète.
- Le baiser, c'est de la bombe.
- J'ai pas de thunes.
L'enfoiré dit qu'il en veut pas.
Non. J'ai jamais dit ça.
Ça suffit, foutez la paix à ce mec !
- Faites chier.
- Espèce d'enculé.
Bee.
Il y a de la baston dans le puits.
Putain.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe, bordel ?
Un toxico pas content lui a dit
que le baiser de la mort valait rien.
Depuis quand on casse la gueule
d'un gars qui dit la vérité ?
J'y suis pour rien. C'est les jeunes.
On peut rien leur dire, à ces branleurs.
On arnaque les négros avec de la merde.
Il faut en parler avec Stringer.
GRILLADES - ÉPICERIE
Salut, Ziggy, ça gaze ?
Zig, qu'est-ce qui t'est arrivé ?
Ces putains de négros m'ont eu.
Quoi ?
Ils m'ont piqué mon fric et ma caisse aussi.
Ils m'ont pris ma bagnole.
Si j'avais eu un flingue, je te promets,
je les aurais dégommés un par un,
ces salauds de fils de putes !
- T'as qu'à aller chez les flics.
- Je peux pas.
C'est une affaire de came.
T'as acheté une grosse quantité, c'est ça ?
C'est ça ?
Bien fait pour ta gueule,
espèce de petit con.
À qui ? White Mike ?
Non, à Cheese, un noir,
au coin de Wolfe et Ashland.
- Quelques grammes, c'est tout.
- Pourquoi pas à White Mike ?
Pas Mike. Tu sais comment il est.
Pourquoi moi,
je saurais comment il est, putain ?
Nicky. J'y suis pour rien, compris ?
C'est vrai.
J'avais pas encore tout écoulé,
mais ces têtes à claques ont rien voulu
savoir, et ils m'ont cassé la gueule.
Ils ont pris mon carrosse, mon vieux.
C'est pour ma rançon.
Et puis ils m'ont dit
que si j'avais pas payé vendredi,
ils allaient me tuer.
Il me faut 2 700 $.
Et alors ?
Puisque t'es un dealer,
va vendre un peu de ta merde.
Tu t'es fait entuber sur tout le paquet,
hein, Zig ?
Je te donnerai pas de blé.
Ils vont me tuer.
J'ai donné tout mon fric à Aimée.
Pour un appartement.
Pour le dépôt de garantie
et des meubles chez Littlepages.
Je n'ai rien pour toi, Ziggy.
SAN DIEGO - 1ER MARS 2003 - CALIFORNIE
Les enculés !
INTERDICTION D'ENTRER
PORT DE SAN DIEGO
- Le capitaine est là ?
- Il est dans son bureau.
Capitaine, on va infiltrer quelqu'un
dans le quartier du port.
Le lieutenant Daniels m'a dit de vous
demander une camionnette pour la planque.
Une camionnette ?
On l'a prêtée au secteur Sud-Ouest.
Tant pis.
Alors comme ça, on veut me faire chier !
Ce qui nous ramène au couple bien connu,
Offre et Demande.
Et voilà.
Je vous rends vos travaux de recherche.
Vendredi prochain,
interrogation sur le salaire.
Bon travail, M. Bell.
- M. Lucas, vous avez cinq minutes ?
- Bien sûr.
Il y a une question que je me pose.
Vous pouvez peut-être y répondre.
Je vais essayer.
Quelles sont les options
avec un produit de qualité inférieure,
dans un marché très concurrentiel ?
Si vous détenez une grosse part du marché,
vous pouvez racheter vos concurrents.
Et sinon ?
Diminuez vos prix
pour accroître votre part de marché.
Ce qui veut dire réduire les frais.
Bien sûr, sinon vous allez vendre à perte.
Ou pire encore.
Non seulement le prix baisse,
mais votre produit peut perdre
la confiance du consommateur.
Le nouveau directeur du marketing
de WorldCom a eu le même problème.
L'entreprise était impliquée dans le plus
gros scandale financier de tous les temps.
- Donc, il a proposé...
- D'en changer le nom ?
Exactement.
C'est lequel ?
Il a une saucisse à la main.
Toi aussi, c'est à ça qu'on te reconnaît.
Thomas Pakusa. Voilà pour vous.
C'est quoi, ce truc-là ?
Assignation devant le grand jury.
Le grand jury ?
Quand vous nous mentez,
vous nous blessez.
Quand c'est à eux, c'est un parjure.
Et je viens d'en délivrer
une autre à votre chef cuisinier, dehors.
Je vous ai connue plus marrante, Bea.
Alors, John Spamanato, il est là.
Johnny Fifty. Comment va me sieur l'agent ?
Johnny Fifty ?
C'est quoi, ça ?
Cet enfoiré a bu 53 demis
pour son 25e anniversaire.
Alors pour être plus, comment dire,
poétique, on a fait une compression.
"Grand jury de la Cour fédérale
de la Juridiction de Baltimore."
Vous avez travaillé sur l'Atlantic Light ?
Tous ceux qui sont montés à bord
doivent témoigner.
Sur quoi ?
Les filles dans le conteneur.
L'inspecteur, là, croit qu'on sait
quelque chose sur cette merde.
Il croit qu'on les a laissées crever
dans le noir,
dans une caisse sur le quai, parce que...
Parce que quoi, inspecteur ?
Pour quelle raison on voudrait
que les filles meurent comme ça ?
Pourquoi est-ce qu'on n'aurait rien
fait, si on avait été au courant ?
J'ai une femme. Et j'ai aussi trois soeurs.
Trois soeurs qui ont des filles.
Et j'ai trop de respect pour les femmes
pour ne pas être indigné
par ce que vous vous imaginez.
Mais de tous les conteneurs du terminal,
c'est celui-là que vous oubliez dans un coin.
On ne le savait pas, bordel de merde !
Vous voulez qu'on fasse la danse
du ventre au grand jury, d'accord.
Tu réponds quoi, Johnny ?
Tu réponds quoi à leurs questions ?
Le cinquième commandement.
Et s'ils t'offrent l'immunité pour témoigner
contre tes frères du syndicat ?
- Je me rappelle pas.
- Tu te rappelles pas quoi ?
Rien.
Ce que vous semblez oublier, c'est que
tous les délégués syndicaux de la côte Est,
sont déjà passés deux ou trois fois
devant un grand jury fédéral.
Vous voulez balancer des assignations ?
Balancez-les.
Vous voulez nos casiers judiciaires ?
Vous avez pas besoin d'assignation pour ça.
Nos registres sont à la disposition
de la justice depuis huit ans.
On a connu Bobby Kennedy,
Nixon le queutard,
Ronald Reagan, le casseur de syndicats,
plus une demi-douzaine de fils de putes.
Et on survivra à vos petites magouilles,
il y a pas de problème.
Ces quatre-là travaillent pas, aujourd'hui.
Vous me laissez les papiers.
Je me charge de les leur porter,
j'irai moi-même.
Vous, vous venez.
- Aujourd'hui ?
- Tout de suite.
Vous décrivez l'arme utilisée
pour tuer M. Grant
comme étant un semi-automatique .380.
Vous indiquez sa taille et vous faites
une suggestion sur son origine.
"Australienne ou un de ces pays en "A"."
Est-ce exact ?
Exact.
Et vous vous trouviez
à environ 15 mètres du tireur ?
Oui, madame. Oui, enfin, à peu près.
M. Little, à cette distance,
comment pouviez-vous identifier
la marque de l'arme ?
Je pouvais pas.
Dans ce cas, comment avez-vous pu
fournir cette information
aux inspecteurs ?
Bird me l'avait montrée.
Il vous avait montré l'arme
avant le meurtre ?
Mais là, on parle de quel meurtre ?
Bird a commis plusieurs meurtres ?
Quand on sait faire
qu'une seule chose dans la vie...
Et comme je l'ai dit, Bird passait son temps
à le montrer à tout le monde.
Parlant de cette histoire-là et d'une autre.
J'en avais rien à foute de ce mec,
et puis j'ai vu qu'il vous intéressait.
M. Little, si vous voulez bien patienter
dans le couloir,
je vais m'entretenir avec l'agent McNulty.
Il s'en tire plutôt bien.
Vous imaginez la contre-attaque
de ce vieux renard de Maury Levy,
quand je vais faire témoigner ce cas social.
Reconnaissez que ça va nous changer.
Au moins, habillez-le.
Dans cette tenue,
je ne peux pas l'appeler à la barre.
Voici un bon
pour une tenue acceptable par la Cour.
Avec une cravate.
Dirt, moi, je te le dis,
Si tu veux bosser pour moi,
faut être avec moi.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
Moi, je serai avec toi.
Je passe mon temps à leur dire :
"Restez à votre poste.
"Au lieu d'aller tout le temps au pieu
"pour essayer de baiser vos pétasses."
Moi, je vous le dis, vous allez l'avoir
dans le cul et profond, parce que moi,
je suis là pour faire ce qu'il faut. Pigé ?
Ces petits voleurs de merde
leur ont tout piqué.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire, Dirt.
Tu veux bosser pour moi, faut être avec moi.
Pour de bon.
GRAND JURY
TRIBUNAL DE BALTIMORE
Où en sommes-nous, Charlie ?
J'ai presque convaincu l'un d'entre eux
de jurer que les docks sont au bord de l'eau.
Ils ne se laisseront pas impressionner.
Bon, alors ?
Ne me dites pas qu'ici,
vous n'avez jamais eu d'indic ?
Un indic ?
Un informateur.
Vous n'avez pas d'informateur
sur les quais ?
Quelqu'un à qui vous pourriez en parler ?
Avec qui vous avez un passé ?
On dit que la valeur d'une police
dépend de ses informateurs.
Autrement dit, on ne vaut pas grand-chose.
J'ai un bon de 150 $.
Regarde ceux-là, sur le portant.
- C'est un genre.
- Pas le mien.
Tu te démerdes tout seul. Je suis
de l'autre côté de la rue, chez les Fédéraux.
Je te retrouve dans une demi-heure.
Et moi, si je suis pas là, c'est que je suis
dans Howard Street, chez Liddell.
MOINS 70 %
C'est ça
ou le coffret gros Nounours va en boîte.
Mais qu'est-ce qu'il fout ?
Il a dit qu'il lui fallait des accessoires.
12-08.
12-08.
Contact demandé avec 12-10.
Joueur numéro un.
Il peut me joindre sur le canal 6.
Bien reçu, 12-08 ?
Message reçu sur le 6.
Tête de noeud, où t'étais ?
Quand on veut travailler en profondeur,
Carv, il faut y aller franco.
Salut. Ça va ? Besoin d'un petit remontant ?
Ça se peut, mec. T'as un peu de coke ?
- T'as de quoi payer ?
- Bien sûr.
D'accord, il y a ce qui faut.
Tu vas voir ça avec un de mes potes. Salut.
Carv, tu vois ce bout de truc ?
Tout est dans l'accessoire, mec.
Tout est dans l'accessoire.
SERVICE D'IMMIGRATION
ET DE NATURALISATION
DÉPARTEMENT AMÉRICAIN
DE SÉCURITÉ INTÉRIEURE
Vous sentez la différence ? Moi non plus.
- Agent spécial Cleary.
- Jim McNulty. Police Urbaine.
Je peux vous aider ?
Elle dérivait sous le Key Bridge.
On pense qu'elle a un lien avec les filles
retrouvées mortes dans le conteneur.
Oui, vos copains sortent d'ici
pour identifier une empreinte sur le métal.
- Des gars de la Criminelle.
- Deux noirs, Moreland, Freamon ?
- Vous bossez avec eux ?
- En quelque sorte.
C'est moi qui l'ai repêchée,
je me sens tenu de prévenir sa famille.
Ça, c'est de la blague !
Non, je me suis dit
que vos agents auraient peut-être
mis au trou certaines de ces filles
qui sont entrées sur le territoire.
Bienvenue dans le monde merveilleux
des Fédéraux.
Un grand jury ?
Ils en ont embarqué quelques-uns.
Ils les ont conduits en ville.
Mais vous ne savez rien.
Non, putain, on sait rien.
Le seul qui sait que vous aviez
un conteneur ce jour-là, c'est Horse.
Il est convoqué,
mais il dira rien à personne.
Tu en es sûr ?
Horse, c'est un roc.
Vous en faites pas pour lui.
Ni pour mon oncle.
Mais tu nous dis qu'il veut arrêter.
Pendant quelque temps.
Il veut que vos conteneurs
cessent d'emprunter nos quais.
Au moins le temps que ça se tasse.
C'était la police urbaine, non ?
Ce qui les intéresse, c'est les filles.
Ça s'est passé sur le bateau.
Le bateau est parti.
Cul de sac.
C'est le malaka qu'ils veulent.
On se l'est déjà fait à Philadelphie.
Encore un cul de sac.
La police n'arrivera à rien.
Mais, plus important,
nous en venons aux inquiétudes de Frank.
Tu diras à ton oncle que je veux le voir.
Lui, il dit qu'il veut voir le Grec.
Tout ce qu'il pourrait dire au Grec,
qu'il le dise à moi.
Il dit qu'il veut le Grec.
Il attend que tu lui dises où et quand.
Niko.
Pour l'autre affaire, les produits chimiques.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez en faire ?
C'est du business.
Avec nous, on fait que des affaires.
On achète un nickel et on revend un dollar.
Mais qui a envie d'avoir des produits
chimiques, même pour un dollar ?
Ce ne sont que les étrangères
en situation irrégulière ?
Du Maryland et du Delaware, oui.
Il y en a qui sont encore en détention ?
Je pourrais leur montrer des photos,
avec un peu de chance.
Celles-là ont toutes été expulsées.
Mais vous vous doutez bien
que certaines sont déjà revenues.
Et vous avez encore des dossiers en cours ?
Bien, c'est ce que je regarde justement.
On a quelques filles détenues à San Diego.
À Seattle, aussi.
Quelque chose pas trop loin en voiture.
La plus proche est à Jersey,
dans le centre d'Hudson.
Lors d'une descente en boîte,
ils en ont mis 12 en taule, il y a 4 jours.
Ça me convient.
Vous allez vraiment prendre sur vos congés ?
Une journée.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a
entre cette fille et vous ?
Quand on peut pas identifier un corps,
vous savez ce qu'on fait à la morgue ?
Moi, je sais.
Salut, Mau. Comment ça va ?
- Comme toujours.
- Oui ?
Tu as eu des jours de congé ?
Plusieurs.
Je suis à la tour maintenant.
Au planning des quais.
Est-ce que tu veux entrer ?
Je dois avoir de la bière
et un peu de Bacardi qui traîne.
On pourrait peut-être juste aller boire
un café et bavarder un peu ?
Je prends ma veste.
Alors je lui ai dit :
"Pourquoi tu fais ça, Dee ?"
Et il est resté assis là,
exactement comme si j'avais rien dit.
Il est furieux.
Tu lui as parlé de nos plans ?
Je lui ai dit
que vous alliez vous occuper de lui et tout.
Et il sait tout ce que tu as fait pour moi,
pendant qu'il était pas là.
Enfin, il sait un peu.
Quoi, c'est vrai,
il a pas besoin de tout savoir.
En tous cas, moi, je te le dis :
je vais y retourner la semaine prochaine.
Et il va me regarder
comme si j'étais transparente.
Il dit de le laisser tranquille.
Faut que je tourne le rôti.
Tu vas voir que c'est pas une blague, String.
La petite Donnette sait faire la bouffe.
Ton père nous casse les couilles,
mon bonhomme.
Qu'est-ce que t'en penses, toi, hein ?
Oui. Je crois que t'as raison.
Qu'est-ce que tu regardes ?
Putain, il fait chier, Ziggy, merde !
Je vais peut-être me faire trouer la peau
pour ses conneries.
Si on est raisonnables,
ils seront raisonnables.
Tu parles, c'est dans ton quartier
que ça marche comme ça.
Quoi ?
On vient voir un mec
à propos d'une voiture.
Si t'allais dire à Cheese qu'on est là.
Cheese. Un blanc. Putain !
Alors t'as mon fric, mec ?
C'est de ça qu'on est venus parler.
Vous, vous êtes sacrément gonflés
de venir ici sans mon putain de fric,
les mecs.
Mec, on a pensé qu'on pourrait s'arranger
pour que tu récupères ce qui est à toi.
Et comment tu comptes faire ?
Tu rends la voiture.
Je vais avec lui la vendre.
Une Camaro de 350 chevaux.
Ça doit valoir plus de 3 000 $.
Ça, c'est bien vu.
Ça oui, c'est bien vu, je dois dire.
Et j'apprécie vraiment
que vous soyez venus me voir.
Je lui donne encore une semaine pour payer.
Parce que ce tas ne vaut pas 3 000 $.
Si tu me crois pas...
Regarde.
En te voyant devant ma porte,
j'avais espéré autre chose.
Et tu t'es dit que je marcherais.
À qui d'autre je demanderais ça ?
Je suis pas un mouchard, Beadie.
Même si c'est toi qui me le demandes.
Je ne vois pas du tout les choses comme toi.
Je me dis : voilà un garçon
que j'ai fréquenté un moment
et même si c'est vrai que ça n'a pas été
aussi loin qu'il l'espérait,
c'est toujours un mec bien,
ça reste quelqu'un à qui je peux parler
de ces choses-là.
Pourquoi ça n'a pas été plus loin ?
Tu n'y es pour rien. Va savoir.
Je n'en sais rien. On ne sait jamais.
Je peux te montrer des photos des cadavres,
les ongles arrachés, le sang sur les parois.
D'un seul coup, tu redeviens flic.
Donne-moi un coup de main, Mau.
Ça a servi à rien de rouler des mécaniques
devant Horseface et les autres ?
C'est assez marrant, quand on y pense.
Oui, tu cours partout comme un poulet
à qui on a coupé la tête
pour avoir des renseignements,
quand une grande partie
de ce que tu cherches
est à portée de la main.
Comment ça ?
Dans le temps, nous, les contrôleurs,
on travaillait avec un papier et un crayon ?
Chaque caisse déplacée sur un bateau
était inscrite.
Puis, quand le bateau avait appareillé
et qu'il n'y avait pas de problème,
on jetait le papier.
Ça ne se passe plus comme ça,
aujourd'hui, hein ?
Il n'y a plus rien à jeter.
L'ordinateur.
Merci, Mau.
Alors ?
Une bonne et une mauvaise nouvelle.
Les putains de négros.
D'abord la mauvaise.
Ils vont toujours te tuer.
Mais dans une semaine.
Qu'est-ce qui peut m'arriver de bon ?
Tu peux résilier ton assurance.
File-moi deux pastilles rouges.
Regarde-moi ça.
Alors, c'est là.
J'espère que vous avez pris des notes.
Et merde !
Entre deux.
Il me fait encore une fois le coup
du cure-dents, je le lui plante dans l'oeil.
Il aurait honte d'appeler ça
de la nourriture, s'il était grec.
Une conversation le rassurerait.
Rassure-moi d'abord.
Cette affaire avec le grand jury.
On a vérifié au tribunal.
Il n'y a rien de spécial.
C'est le jury habituel.
Ils essaient de faire peur aux dockers.
- Et alors ?
- Personne ne parle.
Mais Sobotka, comme je l'ai dit, est nerveux.
Ça fait plus de bruit qu'il ne pensait.
Il lui faut de l'argent pour les avocats.
Double sa paie.
Mais je n'ai pas besoin de lui parler.
Fais parler l'argent.
Tout ce qu'on reçoit d'Atlanta est coupé.
Il y en a de moins en moins
dans leurs livraisons
et le Roberto, là, il se paye note tête.
C'est vrai, ça devient difficile
de conserver les tours,
si on ne peut pas revendiquer le produit,
tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
Qui a la bonne dope ?
L'Est.
L'Est, l'Est, mais qui a l'Est ?
Le gars, là, Milton, celui qu'a un cancer.
Prop Joe.
Le Jamaïcain, là,
qui tient l'avenue au-dessus de Gay Street.
Tu veux parler de Petey, Petey Dixon.
Quand on prend la voie express
à l'heure du déjeuner,
on peut voir tous les camés filer vers l'Est.
Merde !
Je peux toujours tricher en ajoutant de la
merde à de la merde, mais tôt ou tard...
Je sais vieux, j'y pense.
Tu bosses dessus avec Dee ?
Un jeune doit trouver sa route.
Moi, je crois
qu'il faut qu'on continue à l'aider,
qu'on lui trouve un truc, à lui et sa copine.
Qu'on leur montre qu'on a un plan.
On achète un appartement
et on le met au nom de Dee.
Ça lui fait un truc quand il sort.
Fais ça.
Mais tu sais, String,
le passé c'est le passé, tu comprends ?
À trop tirer sur la corde...
Et moi, j'ai été correct avec lui, non ?
Très correct.
Trop correct.
- Où est le Grec ?
- Il m'envoie.
Toi, je t'emmerde et je l'emmerde.
Frank, il m'envoie te dire
qu'on double ta paye.
Pour t'aider à régler les soucis juridiques.
Il m'a dit aussi de te dire qu'il regrette
que tu aies encore des problèmes
à cause de nous.
On jette mes gars
dans des voitures de police
et ce trou du cul
peut pas venir me parler en face ?
J'arrête. Terminé.
J'ai plus rien à faire avec vous,
j'ai pas besoin d'argent ni d'emmerdes,
j'ai un syndicat à diriger.
Ils faisaient de l'acier ici, dans le temps ?
Les cheminées, ça fume.
Mais ce qu'il y a dedans...
Permanganate de potassium.
BIENVENUE SUR LE CATALOGUE
DE LA BIBLIOTHÈQUE
Épelle "permanganate".
M-E-R-D-E.
Qu'est-ce tu fous là, exactement, Zig ?
Moi, je fais partie des contrôleurs.
Et pendant que vous,
les petits gars du quai 47,
vous vous preniez
des cargaisons mahousses sur la gueule,
nous, on chopait le futur par les couilles.
Il suffit que tu tapes tes conneries
là-dessus et la réponse arrive ?
Nick. Juste une question.
Ça te fait quoi de savoir
pourquoi ils veulent ça,
puisqu'ils en veulent ?
Et puis, de toute façon,
si j'ai pas du fric très vite,
moi, je suis foutu.
DROGUESDERUE.BIZ
SUBSTANCES ILLICITES
PRODUITS CHIMIQUES UTILISES
POUR CHANGER LA COCA EN COCAÏNE
Je ne sais pas qui a pu vous dire ça,
mais nous, on n'a pas ce genre de vol
dans notre secteur.
- C'est pas comme dans le temps.
- Non ?
Un petit peu par-ci par-là, mais en général,
Les nouvelles technologies
ont tout transformé.
Regardez, vous voyez la petite boîte, là ?
Mais ça va pas, la tête ?
Ringo est un peu stressé, aujourd'hui.
Il a mal rangé un conteneur frigorifique
plein de thon japonais,
qui aurait dû être
chez le grossiste de Jessup depuis hier.
Je t'emmerde.
- Frank, ces policiers sont de...
- Oui, je les connais.
Frank a participé à l'élaboration du système,
il pourra vous l'expliquer
bien mieux que moi.
Pas de problème, chef.
En gros, ce que vous voyez là,
c'est l'Aqua Verde au quai numéro 4.
Et le planning a prévu 85 mouvements,
c'est-à-dire, autant de caisses,
de conteneurs embarqués ou débarqués.
Si vous regardez l'écran,
vous verrez que lorsqu'une caisse
entre ou sort, l'ordinateur créé un fichier
et le stocke
dans la base de données permanentes.
Il nous a dit que l'ordinateur rendait
plus difficile le vol sur les docks.
Est-ce que notre illustre directeur
vous a dit qu'à ce jour,
nous avions 160 colis manquants,
rien que pour le terminal ici ?
Ou que la dernière fois
qu'on a compté les châssis auto,
il y en avait 300 en moins ?
Non, je suppose que non,
c'est de la gestion pour vous.
160, hein ?
Ils ne sont pas tous volés.
On peut perdre un conteneur par accident,
sans problème.
Pour commencer,
ces portables utilisent des ondes radio.
Mais avec tout l'équipement
et les conteneurs entassés,
il arrive parfois
que les ondes soient renvoyées
et qu'une caisse ne soit pas enregistrée.
Tout aussi facilement,
un contrôleur peut se tromper.
Il peut être feignant, bosser comme
un cochon ou avoir fait la bringue la veille.
Ou plus simple encore, vous avez
de gros doigts. C'est pas une critique.
Imaginez février sur les docks.
Vous portez des gants en Goretex
et vous devez taper des chiffres sur ce truc.
Vous prétendez que c'est ce qui est arrivé
au conteneur
avec les filles ?
Ma chérie,
je ne sais pas ce qui leur est arrivé.
Je dis simplement
que si on regarde l'ordinateur,
on a le sentiment qu'il y a un truc
qui est pas net,
alors que c'est un défaut du système.
Les plombs de la douane sont arrachés
sur celui-là. Ça devrait être signalé.
Quand on décharge un bateau
de la taille d'une petite ville,
on remarque pas toujours
les plombs arrachés.
Vous voulez continuer à nous faire chier,
c'est vote droit.
Mais faut pas dire
qu'il n'y a qu'un seul conteneur qui manque.
On en perd sans arrêt, de ces saloperies.
- Frank a pu vous renseigner ?
- Oui, merci.
Ils se foutent de nous.
BUREAU D'ENQUÊTES
DÉPARTEMENT DE NEWARK
Vous avez fait tout le chemin depuis
Baltimore en priant le bon Dieu, hein ?
Mon affaire est dans l'impasse.
On a quelque chose à leur proposer,
si elles coopèrent ?
Vous pouvez en épouser une
et en faire une ménagère américaine.
Les autres retourneront
là d'où elles viennent.
- Elles sont détenues où ?
- À la prison du Comté.
On ne met pas les situations irrégulières
avec les autres.
Vous connaissez WorldCom ?
D'accord, on va essayer autre chose.
Vous êtes souvent emmerdés par les stups.
Mais vous êtes des garçons biens,
vous avez un mandat lancé contre vous
comme tout le monde ici.
Vous faites quoi ?
On donne un faux nom.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que le vrai nom, ça craint.
Ça craint, d'accord. Ensuite ? Développe.
D'accord, le baiser de la mort,
c'est de la merde. Ça, on le sait.
Faut changer de nom.
Mais encore ?
J'y suis. On remplace les capsules
rouges par des bleues, c'est ça ?
Et on fait croire
que c'est de la nouvelle came, boum.
Et vous savez ce qu'on pourrait faire aussi ?
Donner un nom à chaque tour
et puis organiser comme une compète.
Quand un camé a acheté une mauvaise dope
chez l'un, après, il va chez l'autre.
Mais il y en a un qui pense, ici.
Facile. Je venais juste de le dire.
- Vous avez parlé à mon oncle ?
- Oui.
Ça a été ?
Sans problème.
Trois conteneurs.
Tous sur le Wilhelmina.
Mais faut que tu dises à ton oncle
que c'est trois fois le tarif habituel.
Pour chacun.
On a vu ces produits chimiques.
On a vérifié.
Ça m'ennuyait, vous voyez.
Avant de livrer,
je voulais savoir à quoi ça servirait.
Une bombe ou ce genre ?
J'aurais pas été d'accord.
Vous vous en servez
pour faire de la drogue, c'est ça ?
De la cocaïne.
Si ça vous intéresse toujours,
j'en ai à Fairfield.
Sans problème.
Quand ?
Fin de la semaine.
Maryska.
Elle parle bien anglais.
Elles sont mortes.
Tout ce que je veux,
c'est contacter leurs familles.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle dit ?
Elle veut savoir si elle pourra rester,
si elle connaît une fille.
Vous voulez l'adresse d'un bon restaurant
ou vous repartez tout de suite ?
Un ordinateur ?
Pour trouver les conteneurs disparus dans
les données de l'administration portuaire.
Et vous cherchez quoi ?
Un schéma pour l'affaire. Il faut savoir qui
a laissé ces filles sur le quai et pourquoi.
On est censés être sur Sobotka et le syndicat
des contrôleurs, de toute façon.
Donc, relier une enquête à l'autre,
c'est logique.
Pour moi, non.
Pas question d'associer vos meurtres
à ce groupe d'enquête,
ce serait un boulet pour nous.
Lieutenant !
On fait tomber quelques petits dealers,
on montre qu'on s'est gentiment occupés
de Sobotka et de son syndicat
et c'est plus qu'il n'en faut pour Burrell.
Il me renvoie l'ascenseur, je sors du placard
et je dirige à nouveau des enquêtes.
Vous me collez vos meurtres
que je peux pas élucider et c'est fini.
C'est pas à la Crim qu'on peut
développer une affaire, lieutenant.
Rawls, Landsman,
ils n'ont aucune patience,
sauf pour une fouille rapide.
Et puis, on a assez de place ici.
Vous pouvez vous installer ici.
On partage les informations,
mais les meurtres restent à la Criminelle.
À moins que vous n'ayez un suspect.
Trois rouliers, quatre porte-conteneurs.
J'ai embauché tout le monde,
même les derniers inscrits.
Et j'en ai pas assez.
- Bonne journée.
- Ça, c'est sûr !
Tout le monde travaille, aujourd'hui.
Même vous, les super petits jeunes,
même vous.
Horse est sur le Wilhelmina, aujourd'hui ?
J'ai dit à ce fils de pute que c'était fini.
Je lui ai dit moi-même.
Il a dit qu'il t'avait causé.
Qu'il triplait le tarif pour chaque caisse.
Il triple ?
Appelle Horse à la tour,
dis-lui qu'il est sur le Wilhelmina.
C'est maintenant ou jamais pour nous,
j'ai pas le choix.
Il y a des bateaux, aujourd'hui, oncle Frank.
Aujourd'hui.
Il faut regarder les choses en face.
J'en ai rien à foutre.
C'est pas facile, on dirait, hein ?
- Mars, c'est le dieu de la guerre, non ?
- Une plančte aussi.
Ouais, je sais que c'est une plančte.
Mais l'indice est : dieu de la guerre grec.
Arčs.
Les Grecs l'appelaient Arčs.
C'est le męme gusse avec un nom différent.
Ouais, Arčs, ça entre. Je te remercie.
Il y a pas de lézard.
Je me rappelle qu'ŕ l'école,
j'adorais ces histoires.
Sérieux.
On t'appelle.
L'État appelle Omar Little, Votre Honneur.
Jurez-vous solennellement devant Dieu
de dire la vérité,
toute la vérité et rien que la vérité ?
Ouais, je le jure.
- Indiquez votre nom pour le procčs-verbal.
- Omar Devon Little.
- M. Little, quel âge avez-vous ?
- 29 ans... ŕ peu prčs.
- Et oů habitez-vous ?
- Nulle part en particulier.
- Vous ętes S.D.F. ?
- Oh, disons que je circule, plutôt.
- Et quelle est donc votre profession ?
- Ma profession ?
De quelle façon gagnez-vous votre vie,
M. Little ?
J'arnaque et je dépouille.
- Vous... ?
- Je dépouille les dealers de drogue.
Et dites-nous depuis quand exactement
vous exercez, M. Little ?
Exactement, j'en sais rien.
Mais je pense que ça va faire ŕ peu prčs...
huit ans ou neuf ans.
M. Little, comment fait-on pour voler
des trafiquants pendant huit ou neuf ans
et ętre toujours vivant pour en parler ?
On vit un jour aprčs l'autre, j'imagine.
SUR ÉCOUTE
"Et ça veut rien dire quand un idiot dit
qu'il est différent..." - D'Angelo
Qu'est-ce qu'on sait ?
Sur Sobotka, trčs peu de choses.
Son train de vie correspond ŕ ses moyens.
Une maison ŕ Glen Burnie, un camion payé.
Quelques petites économies.
- Aucun crédit non soldé.
- Des finances réglo. Rien de dramatique.
Bref, c'est pas le portrait
d'un type riche, ça.
- Peut-ętre bien qu'il les cache.
- Les finances du syndicat, c'est pas la joie.
Ils ont réglé la taxe du sičge syndical
un an en retard...
quand le fisc a fait une demande de recours.
Leurs livres de comptes...
- Vous les avez fait saisir ?
- C'était déjŕ fait.
L'I.B.S. a dű ouvrir ses comptes ŕ la Justice
dans le cadre d'une affaire de racket
- ouverte ŕ New York il y a cinq ans.
- On a appelé Washington,
et ils ont envoyé une copie de tout
ce que les gars de Baltimore avaient déclaré.
Ces livres montrent
qu'il reste moins de 100 contrôleurs
qui rčglent encore leur cotisation
ŕ leur local.
Alors qu'ils étaient ŕ peu prčs 300 dans
les années 70. Ils sont vraiment trčs mal.
Bon alors, il est oů,
tout le fric dont Valchek parle ?
L'I.B.S. a engagé Bruce DiBiago pour traiter
avec Annapolis.
Et par l'intermédiaire de personnalités
et de syndicalistes,
ils ont versé 70 000 $
ŕ différentes associations
et ŕ des organisations démocrates
depuis huit mois.
Ils ont noté ça dans leurs livres ?
C'est une estimation
ŕ partir de leurs rapports financiers.
Et c'est seulement ce qui a été versé aux
syndicalistes dont on a recoupé les noms.
- Alors... d'oů sortent ces liquidités ?
- De la drogue.
Pour l'instant, la surveillance téléphonique
du sičge syndical nous a peu appris.
Des coups de fil professionnels
et personnels. Pas de beeper...
Et peu d'appels venant de portables
ou de téléphones publics.
Et vous, dans la rue,
ça donne quelque chose ?
C'est surtout des petits Blancs, nos clients.
De O'Donnell Heights, Greektown,
Highlandtown au-dessus du parc...
- Sans connexion au port ou par hasard.
- L'argent sort bien de quelque part.
Peut-ętre que c'est
ce que les contrôleurs font.
En réalité...
ils sont lŕ pour gérer
tout ce qui entre et sort du port.
- C'est ce qu'ils font. Elle est lŕ, leur valeur.
- Ils font entrer des trucs ?
Ou ils laissent certains trucs se passer.
Le conteneur plein de cadavres de filles.
Ils l'ont pas entré dans l'ordinateur.
On va donc travailler en douceur
sur cet aspect des choses.
Kima... Prez... Tous les deux,
vous allez vous occuper des filles.
Aucun problčme.
Une fois ŕ Baltimore, qui les gčre ?
Elles sont danseuses, prostituées ?
Il faut qu'on se branche sur ce circuit.
Quant aux autres...
Lester continue les écoutes
et l'enquęte sur les livres de comptes...
pour trouver un lien
avec l'argent du syndicat.
Herc et Carver,
vous, vous continuez ŕ bosser
sur les lieux de deal prčs du port.
L'officier Russell et Bunk Moreland
sont chargé des homicides...
Mais pour l'instant,
ils vont rester parmi nous
et explorer le systčme informatique du port
ŕ la recherche d'une preuve de contrebande.
Des questions ?
Excuse-moi.
- Moi, c'est Thomas.
- Beadie.
Ça te dirait pas d'aller au Royal Farms,
qu'on se prenne une tasse de café ?
Ah, ouais.
Hé... Moi, c'est Thomas.
Ça te dit, un café ? Alors ?
Hé, je voulais lui demander
sa petite culotte pour en faire du potage...
mais tu vois,
j'ai eu peur qu'elle le prenne de travers.
Vous dites que vous étiez
ŕ l'extrémité opposée du parking
- lorsque l'assaillant a sorti son arme ?
- Ouais, c'est ça.
Aujourd'hui, dans cette salle d'audience,
voyez-vous l'homme qui a tué M. Gant ?
Hé, ça va, Bird ?
Pour le procčs-verbal,
vous avez identifié l'accusé, Marquis Hilton.
C'est juste Bird, pour moi.
M. Little, vous l'aviez déjŕ vu
de nombreuses fois avant ce jour-lŕ ?
- J'ai fait de la taule avec lui, au Cut...
- Objection. Puis-je vous parler un instant ?
Il tient la route comme témoin.
Dans la rue, on dit qu'Omar était pas
dans les tours quand le type a été buté.
On dit que le petit enculé
était dans les quartiers est,
en train d'allumer des gars
d'Ashland Avenue.
Ah ouais, c'est ce qui se dit dans la rue ?
Mais on n'est pas dans la rue, String.
On est dans une salle d'audience.
Votre Honneur...
Votre objection est dűment enregistrée,
M. Levy. On peut continuer ?
Merci, Votre Honneur.
Les jurés ne tiendront pas compte
de la derničre réponse du témoin,
dans laquelle il expliquait oů il avait
rencontré pour la derničre fois l'accusé.
Oui ou non, M. Little,
connaissiez-vous l'accusé
avant cet assassinat ?
Ouais, je le connaissais, madame,
mais c'était pas un ami, loin de lŕ.
Vous le reconnaîtriez donc
facilement s'il était ŕ une distance modérée,
disons 18 ou 23 mčtres, en plein jour ?
Non, ça serait pas un problčme.
M. Little, est-ce que vous reconnaissez...
cette arme spécifique ?
C'est ŕ Bird, c'est son .380.
- Vous l'aviez déjŕ vu ?
- Ouais, il joue tout le temps avec.
Vous l'aviez donc déjŕ vu
avant le jour de l'assassinat ?
- Et le jour de l'assassinat ?
- Il était dans la main de Bird.
- Quand il a tiré sur M. Gant.
- Oui, madame.
- Bird, il adore les flingues voyants.
- Objection, Votre Honneur.
Et le petit est assez con pour le garder
męme aprčs un meurtre en plein jour.
T'es qu'un enculé de menteur !
Je vais t'arracher les tripes, tu vas crever !
Si l'accusé ne se contrôle pas
je me verrais obligé de le faire évacuer...
et de lever l'audience.
La derničre réponse de témoin sera rayée
du procčs-verbal et le jury l'ignorera.
- Niko.
- Salut.
Eton est mon ami.
C'est bien de présenter un ami
ŕ un ami, non ?
Eton, hein ?
C'est, euh, qu'est-ce que ça veut dire
en grec ?
C'est pas grec. Israélien.
Oh... Ouais ?
Mais t'as une tęte de grec...
sans vouloir ętre vexant...
Dans un sens comme dans l'autre.
- Tu as les produits chimiques ?
- J'en aurai. Autant que vous voulez.
Quand ?
J'allais m'en charger la semaine prochaine.
Seulement, j'ai un petit problčme.
- Quel problčme ?
- Mon cousin, Zig.
Il s'est pris la tęte
avec des gars de Baltimore Est.
Un dealer qui s'appelle Cheese
a volé et brűlé sa caisse.
Et lŕ, il dit qu'il va descendre Zig
s'il est pas payé.
Ouais, malaka. Exact.
Zig a foiré le paquet, grave.
Et alors ? Vous nous livrez les produits,
on vous paie
et vous payez votre dette.
On devait lui filer 2 700 $. T'es d'accord ?
Maintenant ce trou du cul réclame le double.
5 400 $, t'y crois, toi ?
Il a déjŕ détruit la voiture.
Et lŕ, il essaie de nous entuber sur le fric.
- Si tu veux, on le tue.
- Non.
- Ça craint aussi. Non.
- Pourquoi ?
Premičre chose, c'est Zig qui a merdé.
Il doit bien les 2 700 $.
Second truc... si vous liquidez Cheese,
ce sera la guerre avec sa bande, ŕ coup sűr.
Dans un an,
un de ces mecs verra mon cousin
sortir de l'épicerie,
mettre de l'essence dans sa voiture sur
Central Avenue et il lui plombera les tripes.
Il est malin, hein ? Niko... t'es malin.
On n'a pas les muscles pour aller discuter
avec ce gars. Pour régler l'affaire.
J'espérais que tu pourrais le faire, toi.
M. Little...
dites-nous donc pourquoi vous intervenez
dans cette affaire.
- J'ai dit ŕ la police tout ce que je sais.
- On vous a offert autre chose en échange ?
- De quel genre ?
- Aviez-vous été arręté ?
Alliez-vous ętre poursuivi pour un crime
que la police a accepté d'oublier
en échange de votre témoignage ?
Non, il en a męme pas été question.
Combien de fois avez-vous été arręté
depuis votre majorité, M. Little ?
Alors lŕ, j'ai arręté de compter.
Assez pour dire que c'est pas personnel.
Détention d'un revolver.
Détention et dissimulation d'arme.
Voies de faits avec arme...
ensuite vol. Encore détention d'arme.
Et une autre détention de revolver.
Suivie d'une violation de votre parole,
toujours pour détention d'arme...
suivie d'une inculpation
pour tentative de meurtre
et utilisation d'un revolver
lors de la perpétration d'un crime.
C'était pas une tentative de meurtre.
C'était quoi, M. Little ?
J'ai tiré sur le petit Mike-Mike
au niveau de son postérieur, c'est tout.
Je l'ai retouché
pour qu'il ait du mal ŕ s'asseoir.
Pourquoi avez-vous tiré sur Mike-Mike au...
au niveau de son postérieur, M. Little ?
- Il y avait comme un désaccord entre nous.
- Et sur quoi portait-il ?
Voyez, Mike-Mike pensait qu'il devait
garder la cocaďne qu'il fourguait.
Et aussi le fric
qu'il ramassait en la fourguant.
J'avais un avis différent.
Vous volez tout simplement les dealers.
Voilŕ ce que vous faites.
C'est ça, ouais...
Vous marchez dans les rues de Baltimore
avec un revolver.
Vous prenez ce que vous voulez,
quand vous le voulez...
pręt ŕ utiliser la violence
quand vous rencontrez une résistance.
Voilŕ ce que vous faites, qui vous ętes.
Pourquoi devrait-on croire
votre témoignage, alors ?
- Pourquoi devrait-on vous croire ?
- Je sais pas, ça, c'est ŕ vous de voir.
Vous dites... que vous ętes lŕ
et que vous témoignez contre l'accusé
- sans avoir conclu d'accord avec la police.
- C'est vrai, ouais.
Vous ętes lŕ parce que vous,
vous voulez dire la vérité
sur ce qui est arrivé ŕ M. Gant
sur le parking d'immeuble de cette cité ?
Ouais.
Alors que vous ętes tout ŕ fait
le genre de personne qui tirerait,
si elle le pensait nécessaire,
sur un homme dans une rue de cette cité
et qui mentirait ensuite ŕ la police.
Est-ce bien cela ?
J'ai jamais sorti mon putain de flingue
contre un citoyen.
Vous ętes amoral.
Vous ne pouvez pas le nier ?
Vous vous nourrissez de la violence
et du désespoir qu'engendre la drogue.
Vous volez les individus qui eux-męmes
volent les ressources de notre ville.
- Vous ętes un parasite qui s'alimente...
- Ouais, comme toi, mec.
... en profitant des milieux de la drogue.
Quoi ? Comment ?
Moi, j'ai un revolver.
Toi, t'as un attaché-case.
Et c'est le męme jeu, non ?
La situation étant ce qu'elle est,
vous pouvez offrir 10 ŕ 20 pour cent
au-dessus du prix demandé
et ętre toujours compétitifs.
- Męme pour l'adresse d'Hamburg Street ?
- Absolument, oui.
Je dois dire que j'ai bien aimé
la maison au numéro 1501.
Ce qui m'a déplu,
c'est la couleur de la baignoire ŕ remous
dans la salle de bain principale. Magenta ?
- Oh ça, c'est secondaire.
- S'ils veulent vraiment vendre,
ils devraient au moins avoir le bon goűt
de changer cette couleur.
Je sais que c'est un détail
qui ne mérite pas d'ętre discuté.
Vous avez raison.
On devrait continuer ŕ chercher.
On devrait réfléchir avant de se décider.
Vous pensez qu'il y aura
de nouvelles maisons ŕ visiter, dimanche ?
- Pardon, que disiez-vous ?
- Nous allons continuer ŕ chercher.
- Vous nous ferez visiter d'autres choses ?
- Oh... oui, avec joie.
- Le rendez-vous est noté alors. Ŕ dimanche.
- Trčs bien.
Merci.
Ŕ dimanche matin.
Tu es un vrai gamin. Tu sais ça ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
- Un resto et un ciné.
- Tu plaisantes, j'espčre.
- Pourquoi ?
Ça nous conduira nulle part, Jimmy.
Un resto et un ciné...
ensuite je te raccompagne
et tu me dis d'aller me faire foutre comme
t'aurais dű me le dire il y a des années.
Et si je te disais ici et tout de suite
d'aller te faire voir
et que tu gardais l'argent pour une autre ?
S'il te plaît, Elena. Aprčs tout,
j'ai signé tous tes foutus papiers.
Donne-moi une autre chance.
Vendredi. Tu paies la garde des garçons.
- Alors, quoi de neuf ŕ Washington, mec ?
- Toujours pareil, rien de neuf.
La ville Banania,
j'étais pas venu ici depuis longtemps.
On l'appelle plutôt la Dramatique,
maintenant.
Mis ŕ part ça, il y a toujours les putains
de danseuses et les męmes blaireaux.
Toujours la męme soupe.
Du réchauffé, si tu vois ce que je veux dire.
Si t'as besoin de quelque chose,
tu devras trouver une solution tout seul.
Utiliser mes gars, c'est pas possible.
Si Stringer Bell vient jusque lŕ
du fin fond de Baltimore
pour offrir ce genre de contrat,
c'est que le coup doit vraiment rester secret,
n'est-ce pas ?
T'inquičte pas. Il y aura pas d'erreur.
Rien qui pourra te retomber dessus.
- T'es sűr de tes hommes ?
- Mon cousin est lŕ-bas.
- Il s'en charge.
- D'accord.
De toute façon, j'ai horreur
de ces conneries avec les danseuses.
Parce que tu l'as jamais vu en vrai.
Je connais un club ŕ Oxen Hill
qui te ferait changer d'avis.
Ah ouais.
Si je passe dans le coin...
Alors ? Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Une école d'infirmičre.
- Génial, c'est génial.
C'est Lester qui m'y a poussé, en fait.
Il agit... sans que tu t'en rendes compte,
l'air de rien.
Ouais. Je vois ce que tu veux dire.
Il a dit que tu viendrais
car tu as des questions sur les clubs.
Oui, plutôt sur des filles, en fait.
Des Russes.
- Ou des filles de ce coin-lŕ.
- Je vois, celles qui sont dans le circuit.
Tu devrais passer au Nightshift,
c'est ŕ côté d'Holabird.
J'ai une amie qui bosse lŕ-bas et...
elle a travaillé avec plusieurs filles russes,
l'année derničre, pendant trois mois.
- Tu crois qu'elle voudra me parler ?
- Si je lui demande, oui.
Merci, inspecteur. Je n'ai plus de questions.
- Vous n'avez plus de témoins ŕ faire venir ?
- Non, Votre Honneur.
Dans ce cas, dans 10 mn,
nous passerons ŕ la conclusion des débats.
Et je voudrais que demain, on enchaîne
sur les délibérations des jurés.
- Ça a été avec Omar ?
- Vous ne l'avez pas vu faire ?
Non, pas avec Levy. Il a été si bon ?
- Il y a plus de problčme.
- Non ?
Au début, il veut que tu paies les 5 400 $.
Ensuite on discute.
- Il dit non. Tu dois payer les 2 700 $.
- J'ai vu ta façon de discuter.
Mais tu paieras pas les 2 700 $.
Ŕ la place... Il va te filer le fric
pour la voiture qui a brűlé.
- Ah oui ?
- Ouais.
On le connaît pas, lui. Mais celui
qu'il appelle patron, on le connaît bien.
Tu vas rester lŕ ŕ bouder ?
Je sais que t'as compris que je vais pas
dans ce club histoire de mater des filles.
Tu me connais assez pour en ętre certaine.
- Oh... Je les regarderai pas !
- Tout le monde regarde.
- La majorité de ces femmes sont gouines.
- Cheryl, j'y vais pour une enquęte.
Quoi ? Tu crois que c'est ça
qui va me rassurer, peut-ętre ?
Kima retourne enquęter dans la rue, cool !
Toutes ces heures ŕ l'hôpital
avec l'angoisse. La rééducation.
- Toutes tes promesses.
- Enfin, on a déjŕ parlé de tout ça.
Toi, t'as donné ton avis.
T'as fait ton choix toute seule
et j'ai pas pu en placer une.
- Oů est-ce que tu vas ?
- Je vais avec toi.
Tu te fous de moi ?
Qui sait ? Ça me plaira, ce club,
avec un peu de chance.
Bon alors, qu'est-ce qu'on a sur la table ?
Le transport a déjŕ alloué
une somme pour le quai ŕ grains.
Et un emprunt a été fait
pour l'entretien et la drague
du chenal principal.
- Pour le canal, il y a rien ?
- Non, pour lui, on n'a rien eu.
On doit continuer ŕ se battre ŕ ce sujet
et creuser encore plus.
C'est ce que dit Frank.
On aura de la chance
si on peut sauver le quai ŕ grains.
En tout cas, on paie pour mettre
toutes les chances de notre côté.
On a engagé quelques lobbyistes,
versé quelques contributions,
fait travailler un consultant
pour étayer notre dossier
sur l'environnement.
Tout ça, ça coűte,
mais ça donne des résultats.
- Et l'argent, vous le sortez d'oů ?
- Je dévalise des cavistes tous les 3 jours.
Sérieusement.
Non, sérieusement, on a obtenu
de l'aide du bureau national
et plusieurs dons faits par des amis
ont été encaissés ici et lŕ.
Le principal,
c'est que le quai ŕ grains
reprendra du service dans un an,
ce qui représente 200 bateaux
supplémentaires chaque année.
- Mais il y a un si.
- Un putain de gros si.
- Si ce Polack ŕ la mords-moi le noeud...
- Hé, arręte !
Du calme !
Si Krawczyk nous gruge pas en construisant
des immeubles au bord de la mer, c'est ça ?
Nat a raison. Le plus gros danger,
c'est que Krawczyk ou un autre promoteur
obtienne assez de voix pour
faire couler le projet de réhabilitation...
Faut savoir que le quai les intéresse aussi.
Alors on doit se bouger
et passer des coups de fil.
Il faut que les législateurs sachent
qu'on suit l'affaire...
Il y a pas que l'argent pour se faire entendre !
On va faire du bruit, maintenant. D'accord ?
- Du bruit, les gars !
- Assez de discours !
Il y a des mecs qui bossent, demain matin.
- Et les autres, ils ont besoin de se soűler !
- Ouais. Avec joie.
De l'aide du bureau national ?
Des amis qui ont fait des dons ici et lŕ ?
Fais gaffe ŕ tes fesses, Frank.
- C'est ça ?
- Euh, ouais...
on vient de le récupérer
ŕ l'administration du port.
C'est quoi, ce que je regarde ?
L'Atlantic Light le jour oů le conteneur
avec les femmes a été déchargé.
Les rectangles, ce sont les conteneurs.
Celui-ci a été déchargé
et installé sur un châssis.
Lŕ, c'est l'heure. Il était 10 h 31.
Vous voyez ?
Il a été placé allée L, réserve 6, rangée 3,
par un P.P. ŕ... 10 h 37.
- P.P., c'est quoi ?
- Un portique sur pneumatiques.
Donc pour aller du bateau ŕ la réserve
il faut... 6 mn.
C'est comme ça
que c'est censé fonctionner, mais...
"A.Q.Q.Z." comme dans zčbre.
"396594."
Et 7, chiffre de contrôle.
C'est le numéro du conteneur
oů il y avait les filles.
Vous voyez ?
Le numéro n'a jamais été entré.
Pour l'ordinateur donc,
ce conteneur n'existe plus.
Sobotka dit que ce cas de figure se produit
quand les ondes radio sont dans les choux
ou quand le contrôleur
fait une erreur en entrant le numéro.
Notre conteneur a été débarqué
de l'Atlantic Light ŕ... 11 h 26,
et il n'est réapparu
dans l'ordinateur qu'ŕ 15 h 12.
C'est deux heures aprčs que je l'ai trouvé.
Donc, pendant presque quatre heures, il est
resté sur le quai sans ętre pris en compte.
Sobotka dit que des conteneurs
se perdent sans arręt.
Une fois retrouvés,
ils sont remis dans le logiciel.
Est-ce que vous le croyez ?
Non. Pour ce conteneur, non.
Alors qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
Cette base de données
contient le fichier de chaque cargo
arrivant ŕ Patapsco
au cours des deux derničres années.
On va l'examiner en entier
en cherchant si d'autres conteneurs
ont pu disparaître de cette façon.
- Est-ce que c'est systématique ?
- Et combien de bateaux ça représente ?
Des centaines.
Je vois aucune solution miracle
pour résoudre autrement cette affaire.
Ça fait plaisir ŕ voir.
- Qu'est-ce que t'as ?
- Rien...
T'es sűr ? On dirait que tu te sens mal,
que tu vas ętre malade.
Non, c'est... c'est que je peux pas...
les regarder.
Prez... t'es jamais venu
dans ce genre de bar ?
Si, évidemment. Pas en compagnie de filles.
T'es sűre que ça te causera
pas de problčme de nous recevoir ?
J'en ai rien ŕ foutre. Vous ętes des amis
de Shardene, c'est tout ce qui m'intéresse.
En plus, je suis de Westport...
Et j'ai dit direct aux proprios du club...
que j'étais déjŕ lŕ avant qu'ils arrivent
et que je devrais ętre dans la boîte
ŕ leur départ.
- Alors, elles étaient arrivées quand ?
- La derničre fournée, c'était il y a 6 mois.
C'était des Russes, je crois,
mais... leur langue,
on n'y comprend rien, de toute façon.
Tout sonne pareil.
- Qui les a amenées ?
- Le proprio paie un bonus pour elles.
Lŕ, il y avait une femme...
une sorte de maquerelle qui gérait le fric,
- mais... je connais pas son nom.
- C'était aussi une Russe ?
Oh ! Elle était de quelque part.
Elle avait un accent.
Voyons voir... un jour, toutes les filles
du bar sont de Baltimore,
et le suivant... quoi ?
- Il y a plus que des étrangčres ?
- C'est ŕ peu prčs ça. Oui.
Ils se faisaient tant de fric
avec les nouvelles filles
qu'ils ont laissé partir
certaines des danseuses.
C'est pas mon cas,
parce que j'ai de la clientčle ici,
- mais d'autres ont dű se tirer.
- Oů est-ce que les filles logeaient ?
Oů on leur disait. Elles arrivent
de façon illégale, ne connaissent rien,
et elles ont aucune famille.
Les mecs qui se chargent d'elles
sont toujours avec elles.
Ils sont lŕ pour les conduire
du motel oů on les a parquées
au club et pour les ramener...
ils vont leur chercher ŕ manger
et les conduisent ŕ la pharmacie.
Ils sont devant la porte de leur chambre
quand elles vont au motel avec un client.
Aucune n'a essayé de se tirer ?
Oh merde... J'en ai vu une se faire scotcher
aux pistolets paralysants
car elle était allée manger au coin de la rue.
C'est ŕ peine s'ils laissent
ces filles aller aux toilettes toutes seules.
Et quand il y en a une
qui devient trop proche d'un client, pss !
Ils font bouger l'équipe
vers une autre ville, c'est tout.
Et personne peut les aider, du coup.
Terminé.
C'est ŕ toi aprčs la prochaine chanson.
Alors mets mon numéro.
Faut que j'aille bosser, chérie.
Si tu veux qu'on discute encore,
téléphone. Si je peux t'aider, je le ferai.
Je dirai ŕ Shardene que tu la salues.
Elle s'est tirée depuis un bail,
elle doit bien s'en sortir, non ?
Je parie qu'elle s'est trouvé
quelqu'un de riche et gentil.
- T'es sa gonzesse ?
- Ouais.
Moi non plus, je laisserais
pas la mienne venir lŕ sans moi.
Les filles dans cette boîte...
ce sont des acharnées.
Treize filles.
Elles avaient environ un tiers
de cet espace caché derričre une cloison.
Elles avaient quelques lampes torches...
Un peu de nourriture ŕ la con, un peu d'eau,
des WC portables qui servaient ŕ toutes...
et pas assez d'oxygčne.
Je programme le verdict
pour la troisičme semaine du mois prochain.
Souhaitez-vous ajouter quelque chose ?
Euh... Votre Honneur, mon client,
qui a conservé les moyens
de faire appel contre le futur verdict,
souhaite que je déclare que,
quelle que soit la décision des jurés,
il a été victime du parjure
du principal témoin de l'accusation.
Et nous voulons
que cet appel soit enregistré
pour qu'il puisse participer
ŕ la suite de cette affaire.
Un appel
pour une condamnation pour meurtre ?
- M. Levy, vous perdez la tęte ?
- Votre Honneur...
Il n'y aura pas de demande d'appel
acceptée au cours du jugement,
et en ce qui me concerne,
le rapport de précondamnation
n'est qu'une simple formalité.
M. Hilton a été déclaré coupable
du meurtre d'un témoin de l'État
qui était venu ici, dans ce tribunal.
Il a exécuté cet homme de sang-froid...
et contre de l'argent.
Ŕ moins que le rapport de précondamnation
n'indique qu'il est en fait
le Messie revenu parmi nous,
il sera trčs certainement condamné
ŕ perpétuité, sans conditionnelle,
par un juge de Baltimore qui,
pour une fois dans sa vie,
rentrera chez lui avec le sentiment
que son travail était important.
M. Hilton,
ętes-vous le Sauveur revenu sur terre ?
- Excusez-moi ?
- Ętes-vous Jésus-Christ revenu sur terre ?
On se revoit au verdict.
Vous avez aimé le show, vous aussi ?
M. Little...
ceci vous fera sortir de prison une fois,
quel que soit le délit, tant que les coups
et blessures ne sont pas invoqués.
- Ben, merci, madame.
- Non, merci ŕ vous.
C'était un vrai plaisir.
Et maintenant, la cérémonie des insultes.
Viens me voir en taule,
pauvre lécheur de culs de flics !
Je te la ferai bouffer, ta langue de suceur !
Essaie de cogiter, Bird.
Pense ŕ Brandon en tirant ta peine,
tu piges ?
Je vais te raser le cul avec un flingue !
Putain de merde ! Ouais, tu vas le regretter !
Tu l'as vraiment vu tirer de lŕ-bas ?
Tu tiens ŕ le savoir ?
Mais c'est foireux parce que... le type
est arrivé lŕ oů il fallait qu'il soit...
et elle en valait męme pas la peine.
Daisy, elle était pas mieux que n'importe
quelle autre salope, vous voyez.
Et il a fait tout ça pour elle.
Et ŕ la fin, c'est la merde et c'est tout.
Fitzgerald disait que dans les vies
américaines, il n'y avait pas de second acte.
- Vous pensez que c'est juste ?
- Merde, nous, on est enfermés.
Alors vaut mieux pas qu'on croit ŕ ça !
Il dit que le passé reste toujours avec nous.
Que lŕ d'oů on vient,
que tout ce qu'on a déjŕ vécu
et comment on l'a vécu...
c'est ça qui est important.
- Enfin, j'ai pensé que c'est ce qu'il disait.
- Oui.
Ŕ la fin du bouquin, vous savez,
ce truc avec les bateaux et les marées,
c'est comme si vous pouviez changer.
Vous pouvez dire que vous ętes un autre.
Vous inventer une nouvelle histoire.
Mais, ce que vous étiez avant,
c'est réellement ce que vous ętes.
Et ce qui s'est passé avant,
c'est ce qui s'est passé réellement.
Et ça veut rien dire
quand un idiot dit qu'il est différent...
parce que ce qui vous rend différent,
c'est ce que vous faites
ou ce que vous vivez réellement.
C'est comme
tous les bouquins dans sa bibliothčque.
Alors il se cache
derričre tous ces bouquins.
Mais si on en prend un sur une étagčre,
on voit bien qu'il n'a jamais été ouvert.
Il a tous ces bouquins,
et il en a męme pas lu un.
Gatsby, ben, il était ce qu'il était...
il a fait ce qu'il a fait.
Et comme il était pas pręt
ŕ ętre lucide avec son histoire...
c'est ce qui l'a fait tomber.
Je crois, en tout cas.
Bureau des conteneurs - Patapsco
Appel : 10 h 51
Excuse-moi, désolé, vieux.
Il est fini, ton procčs ?
- Dans ce cas, on va se faire une sortie.
- Non, demain.
- Demain, je t'accompagnerai, Diggsy.
- T'as autre chose ŕ faire, aujourd'hui ?
Ouais. Un dernier boulot urgent.
- Hé, ton boulot, il est lŕ.
- Non, ça, c'est la retraite, plutôt.
Et aprčs cette journée,
je serai ŕ la retraite !
Tu parles quand je te dis. Pas avant.
- Tovarich !
- Sergei... Mon frčre !
- Hé, t'as maigri, toi.
- Tu déconnes...
On te verra plus, si tu continues.
Dans ce pays...
Les supermarchés sont des cathédrales.
- Je m'inquičte pour toi, vieux.
- Comment ça va, chez toi ?
Ça va. Ça va.
Alors tu l'as vu, le mec pour l'autre affaire,
ça y est ?
Tu sais que je suis pręt
ŕ mettre un gros paquet lŕ-dedans.
- Plus tard. Je suis lŕ pour un autre plan.
- Comme tu veux.
C'est le mec
ŕ la pauvre Camaro toute pourrie ?
C'était la bagnole de mon cousin.
Et elle était pas si pourrie.
Désolé. Nicky est avec nous. Son cousin...
Mais la famille, on peut pas la choisir.
Tu l'as dit !
J'ai des putain de neveux et de beaux-frčres
qui me collent des emmerdes... sans arręt...
Je leur mettrais bien une balle dans la tęte.
Mais on m'en casserait les oreilles ŕ Noël.
Je te jure... Tu vois, moi je vis avec un lot
de putains de nčgres bien lourdingues.
C'est quoi, le lézard ?
En gros, vous avez pas payé
mon gars Cheese et lui, il m'a pas payé...
Lŕ, on cause pas de millions de dollars...
Mais tu vois, Cheese, il est pas en position,
ŕ son coin de rue,
de laisser ton cousin foirer
et montrer un sale exemple.
Si le mec est cool avec vous,
trčs vite, tous les Blancs un peu barjos
viendront le seriner.
On veut payer ce qu'on doit.
Enfin, les 2 700 $.
- Et on les aura assez vite.
- Ton mec a doublé la somme.
Il a aussi brűlé la caisse.
Ŕ l'argus, cette bagnole vaut 5 100 $.
Laisse-moi réfléchir une seconde...
Toi, tu viens me voir ici
alors que vous avez foiré un plan...
en me demandant de dire ŕ Cheese,
dont vous avez foiré le plan,
de vous rembourser de 2 400 $.
Il garde la bagnole pour lui.
Dis donc, ça doit ętre un sacré pote ŕ vous,
ce rigolo ?
Le Cheese, il va pas vraiment ętre heureux
d'avoir ŕ me payer.
Et si j'ai un conseil ŕ vous donner,
c'est de pas vous approcher trop de lui.
Il a aussi intéręt ŕ éviter mon cousin.
En tout cas...
merci d'avoir été réglo sur ce coup.
Crétin. S'il y avait pas Serge,
toi et ton cousin vous seriez plus
que deux enfoirés ŕ l'état de cadavres.
J'ai tout essayé, l'I.N.S., les Douanes,
męme le département d'État, pour que dalle.
Laisse tomber, Jimmy.
T'auras fait de ton mieux.
Ouais, t'as raison, j'arręte lŕ.
Pour celle-ci... autopsie demain matin.
Avec un dossier sous X.
- C'est pas juste, ce coup-lŕ.
- Parce qu'il y a des fois oů c'est juste ?
Tu dois laisser faire Avon.
Il va faire raccourcir ta peine
de quelques années.
Ouais, j'en doute pas, connaissant Avon.
Ça va aller, Dee. Tu sais que c'est simple.
Tu n'auras qu'ŕ ressortir
ce que Levy t'a dit de dire.
Qu'est-ce que t'as qui va pas ?
Dis-moi quelque chose !
La drogue coupée. C'était Avon.
Je veux que tu rentres ŕ la maison, Dee.
Tu m'as demandé un service.
Je te rends ce service.
- Je suis lŕ et je tire mon temps, c'est tout.
- Tu vas m'écouter ?
- Je te dis que...
- Maman !
Maman, tu te souviens
quand on habitait sur Linden Avenue ?
Tu te souviens de cette maison ?
J'avais... J'avais quoi, six ou sept ans...
Je m'amusais sous le porche.
Et lŕ, il y a les jumeaux qui viennent
et qui commencent ŕ me parler...
Tu te rappelles ?
Je cogne sur la porte pour essayer d'entrer
et toi, t'es plantée derričre,
pręte ŕ l'ouvrir.
Sauf que tu fais rien
et que tu me laisses dehors.
Tu me dis d'y retourner et de me défendre.
Ça fait rien que je gagne ou non.
Tu te souviens ?
- Ils t'ont mis une vraie raclée.
- Ouais.
Et ensuite tu m'as dit :
"Petit, c'est peut-ętre moi
qui t'ai fait venir dans ce monde,
"mais ce sera ŕ toi de jouer
si tu veux y rester."
Tu vois, maman, eh bien, je suis toujours lŕ.
Moi. Tu dois me laisser vivre
comme j'ai envie de vivre.
Tu vas dire ŕ Avon, ŕ Stringer et ŕ Donette,
tu leur dis ŕ tous...
de me laisser tranquille.
Ça suffit, vous me faites chier.
J'ai besoin d'un verre.
Attends, on a presque fini 2002.
- Demain sera un nouveau jour, pas vrai ?
- Et ouais.
Ils ont l'air desséchés,
la tournée est pour moi.
Merci, M. Sobotka, l'ami du travailleur !
Le grand maître du jeu !
Combien de voix on a récolté
ŕ Annapolis, ce soir, Frankie ?
- Il y a longtemps que t'es lŕ ?
- J'avais encore les cheveux bruns.
J'étais en train de discuter
avec Chess de Benny.
- Benny, le cheveu sur la langue ?
- Ouais, trčs drôle.
Benny travaillait dans le trou
et a été touché par une chaîne.
Le truc l'avait secoué vraiment fort,
mais il en a parlé ŕ personne.
Jusqu'ŕ ce qu'il arrive ici.
Little Nose dit ŕ Benny
de téléphoner ŕ l'avocat du syndicat.
- Paul Sevel.
- Ouais.
Que son âme repose en paix, tiens.
Alors Benny téléphone ŕ Paul.
"Z'ai été zelé par une zaine", dit Benny.
"Comment ça, gelé, Benny ?"
"Tu retravailles dans les congelés ?"
que Paul lui dit.
"Non ! Z'ai été zelé par une... zaine !"
Et il raccroche le téléphone
comme une brute !
"L'enfoiré vient tout de zuite,
il ze ramčne ici !
"Il dit qu'il comprend pas ze que ze dis !"
Alors Little Nose dit :
"Pourquoi il se déplace ?"
"Benny, on le comprend pas mieux
quand il parle en face !"
Ça y est, entre moi et Cheese, c'est réglé ?
Ouais, c'est bon.
Et les 2 400 $, c'est pour Princess.
Mais elle valait plus que ça.
Hé, Dolo ! Je paye ma tournée.
T'as gagné ŕ la loterie ?
Si mon vieux le fait,
j'ai bien le droit de le faire aussi.
- Tu déconnes carrément, toi.
- Nick... quand j'ai du fric, je le claque.
- On n'a qu'une seule vie, tu sais.
- La suivante, c'est la mienne.
- Rien pour moi, je dois y aller.
- Allez, Frank, trinque avec nous.
Ce sera pour un autre soir.
- Et celui-ci aussi, hein ?
- On en a 22.
Tous de la Talco Line et tous
avec Horseface Pakusa travaillant dessus.
- On les tient, lŕ.
- T'avertis Bunk ?
M. Moreland est indisposé.
- T'es avec Daniels et les autres ?
- Oh, non...
On a les ordinateurs lŕ-bas, c'est tout.
On est des orphelins.
- Des orphelins ?
- Ouais !
Rawls, il... ŕ l'entendre,
si je reviens pas ŕ la maison
avec ces 14 cas résolus,
je rentre plus ŕ la maison, fini.
Et Lester aussi.
Oů est l'amour, Jimmy ?
Oů est cette putain... de saleté... d'amour ?
- Et toi, quoi de neuf, mon vieux ?
- Rien du tout.
Rien du tout ?
Je suis fini, Bunk.
Bird était la derničre affaire qui me restait.
J'ai absolument rien de nouveau.
Il y a elle que j'ai essayé d'identifier.
Mais je peux męme pas te dire pourquoi.
C'était pour faire semblant d'ętre encore
un flic de la Criminelle, sans doute.
Tout le monde s'en fout, de toute façon.
Elena et moi, on va retenter le coup.
Merde.
Ouais, j'arręte de m'exploser la ruche, Bunk.
Terminé !
C'est bon. Maintenant, on rentre.
Euh, je te suis, mon vieux.
Hé, attends, tęte de pioche !
Qu'est-ce qui t'est arrivé ?
- Je suis tombé.
- Combien de fois t'es tombé ?
Ramčne-toi.
- Pop, je suis...
- Marche avec moi, Zig.
Si on gagne le vote, ce quai pourra
refonctionner au printemps prochain.
- Plus de cargos, plus de travail.
- Ouais ? Génial.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais, putain ?
- Comment ?
C'est mon fils qui a brűlé un billet
de 100 $ comme un trou du cul...
dans un bar plein d'ouvriers ?
- Ça voulait dire quoi, hein ?
- C'était pour me marrer.
- Te marrer ?
- Ouais. Me marrer.
Si tu veux encore me cogner, Pop, vas-y.
Lance-toi, allez.
Oů tu l'as pris, tout cet argent ?
T'as fait aucune heure.
Ça, j'en ai pas fait.
Parce que mon pčre est au syndicat.
Fais chier.
Priorité ŕ l'ancienneté, Zig.
- C'est le seul systčme pour rester honnęte.
- Je sais. Je me plains pas.
J'aimerais te faire bosser plus.
J'aimerais te donner plus, tu peux me croire.
- Oh, tu donnes beaucoup.
- Enfin, tu le sais, Zig !
J'aurais du écouter ta mčre.
Parce qu'elle a toujours voulu que...
Pop ! Tout va bien !
Tu devrais faire deux ans de fac,
comme a fait ton frčre.
Pop ! Pop ! Arręte !
Tu veux que je te dise
de quoi je me rappelle ?
Ça t'intéresse ?
Je me rappelle de toi. Et d'oncle Jerry...
et d'oncle Walt et de Pe-Pop.
Tous assis dans la cuisine autour de la table
ŕ discuter des équipes ou d'untel et untel...
Qui est le meilleur ŕ la grue ?
Ou qui est-ce qui va le plus vite ?
Qui c'est qui fout rien ?
- Vous vous engueuliez, tu te rappelles ?
- Quatre Polacks, six opinions.
Je me souviens... quand vous ętes
tous descendus faire le piquet de grčve
ŕ Covington Piers...
Et Jackie Taylor s'est fait rouler dessus
par une voiture de police
au milieu de tout ce bordel.
Je me souviens quand le Paceco est tombé
pendant une tempęte.
Tu t'en souviens aussi ?
Le Gros Rick y est resté.
Ouais, et de quoi encore tu te rappelles ?
De tout. De tout, ouais.
Alors dites-moi, M. Souvenirs.
On fait quoi ŕ traîner avec les rats des quais
en pleine nuit ?
Pas la moindre idée.
Les Post-it, c'est pour chaque conteneur
qui a disparu
quand il a été déchargé...
euh, les jaunes,
c'est pour ceux qui ont été retrouvés
Leur contenu légal intact et réenregistrés.
On dira
que ce sont des erreurs involontaires.
Les verts et les roses,
ce sont les conteneurs égarés pour de bon.
L'ordinateur n'en a plus aucune trace.
Les roses,
comme le conteneur avec les filles,
appartenaient tous
ŕ la męme compagnie de transports, Talco.
Et c'est le męme contrôleur,
Thomas Pakusa,
qu'on appelle Horseface, qui les a comptés.
Vous vous ętes déjŕ occupés de lui ?
On l'a fait passer devant le Grand Jury,
mais le bâtard n'a pas bougé.
Vous voulez sortir ?
Vous voulez aller aux toilettes ?
Oh... Non, ça va aller.
Ce qui est important, lŕ,
c'est qu'on a un schéma qui se reproduit.
Leur maničre de faire éliminer
pratiquement toute trace écrite.
Une fois le fret placé
sur un camion en partance,
et il y a des dizaines de façons de le faire,
tout ce qui reste de l'opération,
c'est une indication
dans la base de données.
La boîte est débarquée du cargo,
on la suit quelques minutes
et puis c'est terminé... elle s'est envolée.
Notre cible... est censée ętre Sobotka,
n'est-ce pas ?
Sur le papier en tout cas.
Vous ętes en train de me dire
qu'il y a un maximum de chances
pour que ce gars
soit aussi un client pour Bunk, non ?
Peut-ętre qu'on pourrait associer
notre enquęte ŕ la vôtre, lieutenant.
Pour que j'endosse 14 meurtres
qui seront peut-ętre jamais élucidés ?
- Les patrons ne vous le reprocheraient pas.
- Mais ce serait pas glorieux !
J'essaie de profiter de cette enquęte
pour obtenir une équipe plus importante.
Si je reste avec des affaires non résolues,
ça risque de faire mauvais effet.
- Quelle est l'étape suivante ?
- On se connecte au logiciel
et on surveille ce qui se passe
sur les quais en temps réel.
Merde.
Hé, Dee.
Que du vin, alors ?
Maintenant, je ne bois plus beaucoup.
Tu veux pas un whisky ?
Ou alors, un petit coup vite fait
avec la serveuse ?
D'accord, ça aussi, je l'ai bien mérité...
Męme si ce sont des choses
que je fais plus beaucoup non plus.
- Autre chose ?
- J'arręte, je suis désolée...
Je sais pas pourquoi je dis ça.
Il y a un an qui s'est écoulé.
- Mais t'as des raisons d'ętre en colčre.
- Ŕ quoi ça me servirait ?
Et le travail ?
Comme ça, on aura parlé
de tous les sujets dans ma vie
qui te tapent sur les nerfs.
- L'alcool, les femmes, le boulot...
- C'était... pour discuter, c'est tout.
- Eh bien, je suis ŕ la retraite.
- Comment ça ?
Je fais... dans les bateaux.
Fini les meurtres.
Les bons jours, j'attrape des crabes
et je compte les goélands.
- Ce n'est pas toi.
- Ce n'était pas moi.
Ça me ressemblait pas d'arręter l'alcool.
Ou d'arręter de faire le con.
Un tas de choses me ressemblaient pas.
Laisse-moi encore une chance.
Je préfčrerais plutôt qu'on tire un coup.
- Salut... ça va ?
- Ça va ?
Une fois vidés, faudra larguer
les remorques et les camions.
Qu'ils aient l'air d'avoir été volés.
Niko.
Si tu veux... je te paie en cash.
Ou... Eton te paie... en héro.
De la pure.
Si tu te débrouilles bien,
tu peux te faire... 60 000 ou 70 000 $.
Nicky, il nous offre trois ou quatre fois
la valeur de ce qu'on leur file.
Sans moi, les gars.
Écoute, Nick...
Męme si on le fourgue ŕ White Mike,
on pourra se faire 30 000 ou 35 000 $.
Nicky, déconne pas.
Alors une moitié en cash et l'autre en dope.
Nicky... Je peux fourguer de cette dope.
Aucun problčme.
- Non, Zig, je le ferai.
- Nicky, t'y connais rien !
Oh, t'es bouché ?
Je m'en charge, cette fois !
Toi, regarde des dessins animés.
Et tu me laisses cette affaire
pour nous deux, d'accord ?
Putain. Tu veux rentrer ŕ pied ou quoi ?
Salut, ma jolie !
- Alors on va faire quoi, aujourd'hui ?
- Moi ?
- Il va falloir que j'aille chercher les garçons.
- D'accord. Chouette.
Je les ramčne ŕ la maison.
Michael a son piano tout ŕ l'heure.
Et aprčs on fait quelque chose.
Peut-ętre qu'on peut passer
chez moi que je prenne des affaires.
Je ne veux pas que les garçons
sachent que tu es venu.
Ils se remettraient ŕ espérer.
Alors... il faut que tu t'en ailles.
Regarde comme ils l'ont massacré.
Ces enculés respectent męme pas
ce qu'on leur file gratis.
Laisse. Je vais voir s'il y a du scotch
dans la réserve pour essayer de le recoller.
- Dee, c'est ça ?
- Ouais.
T'as pas le droit d'ętre lŕ, mec.
Il y a pas de journaux de sport
cette semaine, des fois ?
- Si, on en a.
- J'en ai pas vu de l'autre côté.
Attends, laisse-moi une seconde,
que je finisse ça vite fait.
Ensuite, je te les trouve.
- Salut.
- Quoi ?
C'est toi qu'as mes cigarettes, enfoiré.
- Donne-m'en une ! Allez, fais un geste !
- Eh, tu déconnes...
Il y a quoi, lŕ ?
Je peux vous aider ?
- C'est pour un enterrement.
- Désolé.
Si, pour un enterrement, vous savez.
Non, je voulais dire désolé
que vous ayez perdu quelqu'un.
Oui, oui.
Cette préparation a beaucoup de succès.
- C'est un proche que vous avez perdu ?
- Non. On bossait ensemble.
- Je vois. Une relation professionnelle alors.
- Ouais, professionnelle.
Ce mec c'était pas la famille, d'accord,
mais c'était mon frère quand même.
Je crois que j'ai pigé. Viens, suis-moi.
Ouais, classe ! C'est ça qui me faut. Classe !
La couronne flingue à gauche,
on la vend bien, en ce moment.
On peut la faire en blanc, en rouge,
en rose, en n'importe quoi.
- En rose ?
- Ton pote, il était trop dur pour du rose ?
Non, c'est pas ça, mais quand même.
Putain, quand t'es black,
tu dois rester fidèle jusqu'au bout, non ?
Si on y met du rose, c'est la fin.
Ça se tient. Qu'est-ce qu'il lui est arrivé ?
Il s'est pendu.
Dans sa cellule avec
un pauvre bout de ficelle.
Le juge s'était acharné sur lui,
il en avait pris pour vingt ans.
Il a dû se dire qu'il aurait pas
la patience d'attendre.
Bon, d'accord,
il était plutôt lâche comme nègre,
mais c'est pas une raison suffisante
pour salir son nom, j'ai pas raison ?
Je vais vous dire. Faites-moi un truc
avec des couleurs chaudes, d'accord ?
Du rouge, du noir, on s'en fout.
Mais que ça ressemble à une des tours
de Franklin Terrace, vous voyez ?
À une des tours hautes, d'accord ?
Tu veux que la couronne
ait l'air d'une tour haute du Project ?
Ouais, c'est ça. Ouais.
Et écrivez deux cent vingt et un, dessus,
en super gros, que tout le monde le voie.
Ça roule ?
Ouais, ce mec, il venait de la Tour Fremont.
Alors, deux cent vingt et un.
Tu veux rajouter quelque chose ?
Du genre ?
Je sais pas. En souvenir. Repose en paix.
Ce genre de chose, quoi.
Quelque chose qui dise
tes sentiments par rapport à ce deuil.
Écoute, man. Fait chier ces trucs.
Faites juste que...
Faites juste que la tour
ait l'air d'une tour, d'accord ?
OK. Merci.
SUR ÉCOUTE
"T'en fais pas, mon gars,
t'es toujours en vie." - Horseface
- Vous avez cloné un quoi ?
- Un ordinateur.
On peut voir comment les marchandises
sortent des bateaux en temps réel.
On peut donc surveiller la contrebande
et voir où elle nous conduit.
Ici, on doit faire face à vingt-cinq meurtres
par mois. C'est M.A.S.H. tous les jours.
Et tout ce que vous allez faire, c'est nous
ralentir à tenter votre chirurgie cérébrale.
Si Rawls met les pieds ici et vous trouve
tous les deux penchés sur votre bidule,
faisant des jeux vidéo sur quatorze meurtres
non résolus, il nous pète un plomb !
Et c'est justement pour ça
qu'on a demandé à Daniels
de nous installer dans un local à lui,
dans le secteur Sud Est.
Lui aussi a un oeil sur les docks. Pour
d'autres merdes. Des histoires de drogue.
- Daniels, celui qui était aux Stups ?
- Voilà.
Si Daniels a déjà une enquête en cours,
il pourrait prendre la nôtre en charge.
Il est pas dingue, Jay.
Il nous a juste prêté une piaule, c'est tout.
Ça veut dire oui ? Il vient de nous
donner son accord, j'ai bien compris.
J'en sais rien.
Et maintenant, on fait quoi ?
On s'arrange pour que les gars des docks
pensent qu'on a changé de crémerie.
On leur a foutu la trouille
avec nos conneries de Grand Jury.
Ils vont se méfier.
Maintenant, si on veut s'occuper d'eux,
ils doivent croire
qu'on est plus un problème.
Et comment ils vont croire ça ?
Non, non, mec,
c'est pas comme ça que ça marche.
Non, non, non.
Parce que c'est moi
qui passe mes journées à dealer, tu vois ?
C'est moi que la police fera chier
si elle se pointe. Pas toi, t'es pas connu.
Non, ce qu'il faut que tu fasses,
c'est que tu lâches tout ce que t'as
à un prix cool, d'abord.
Et vendredi soir, quand moi et mes potes
on a fini de tout vendre,
tu te pointes et on te paie.
C'est ça que je me dis.
Frog ?
Viens voir.
Non, sérieux, viens voir.
Avant toute chose,
et je sais pas trop comment te le dire
sans te blesser profondément.
Mais avant toute chose,
il se trouve que tu es blanc.
Je veux dire un de ces Blancs
qui grandissent sur Rapolla Street
et que maman emmène chouiner
à Saint Casimir
comme tous les gentils
minables petits pisseux du quartier.
Deuxièmement, tu vois,
moi aussi, je suis blanc.
Et j'ai rien à voir avec ce genre
de Blancs qui chient dans la rue.
Moi, je suis un Blanc syndiqué,
un Blanc syndiqué au local quarante-sept.
Un Blanc qui bosse pas
sans un putain de contrat
et un Blanc qui reste pas le cul
par terre à écouter tes excuses à la noix
comme mon cousin Ziggy, à qui d'ailleurs,
toi et ta petite bande de déguisés du trottoir
et autres nases, devez toujours du fric.
Alors, tu vas regarder dans tes poches et tu
te ramènes avec les cinq cents d'avance
et avec les deux cent dix que tu dois à Zig.
Et là ensuite, ma poudre, tu l'auras.
Si c'est celle que t'a balancée la semaine
dernière, celle que vendait Moochie.
C'était de la bonne.
Moochie l'a vite bazardée.
OK, ça roule.
Bon mec, je t'envoie un de mes potes
avec le fric qu'on te doit.
- Tu disparais pas ?
- Je risque pas.
- T'avons-nous donné satisfaction ?
- C'est de l'excellent travail.
Les autres prisonniers disent
que le garçon s'est pendu, c'est ça ?
Il semblerait, oui.
Mon cousin fait toujours
un boulot très clean.
C'est pas mes affaires. Je sais.
Mais ton mec, là, Avon,
tu l'as mis au jus ou non ?
T'es solo là-dessus ?
T'as raison.
T'as raison, c'est pas tes affaires.
Et si j'étais toi,
je ferais en sorte que ça n'arrive
pas trop vite dans les oreilles d'Avon.
À Baltimore, vous êtes tous givrés.
Nègres ou pas. Tous givrés.
Tu ferais mieux de t'y mettre.
Ça va refroidir. C'est bon, cette merde.
Arrête, man. C'est pas ta faute
ce qui est arrivé à Dee. C'est son trip à lui.
Il savait très bien qu'il devait s'en sortir
tout seul ou crever dans ce trou. D'accord ?
Ouais. Je l'emmerde, ce con.
Il savait très bien, quand il s'est pendu,
que c'était nous qui allions souffrir.
Il savait très bien, quand il a fait ça, qu'on
allait morfler des instants comme celui-ci.
Il le savait, ça.
Ce nègre, il a fait ça
juste pour me faire du mal.
Tu vois, je me rends compte.
Dee, c'était juste un putain de faible.
J'ai essayé de l'emmener
depuis qu'il est gamin ce nullard,
depuis qu'il est gamin, je le porte...
- Je sais. T'as été bon avec lui. Vraiment.
- Ça, tu l'as dit.
Tu sais man, c'est triste, ce qui s'est passé.
Tout ça là, c'est triste, quoi.
Mais le môme, il avait déjà failli parler
une fois et je sais pas, tu sais,
il disait qu'il tiendrait jamais
toutes ces années là-dedans
et si ça se trouve, il aurait parlé
encore une fois. On sait pas.
Moi, je dis juste
que peut-être que c'est mieux comme ça.
Tu crois pas ?
Son nom est Gland. Tête de gland.
Attends, regarde ça.
Mets ton doigt là-dessus. Alors ?
- Chouette.
- C'est chouette ?
- Messieurs ?
- On aurait besoin d'un micro espion.
Un truc qui résisterait
aux marasmes de l'environnement
du crime urbain moderne.
Je crois que j'ai ce qu'il vous faut.
Voilà, messieurs. Voilà la merveille.
Plus petit qu'un vingt-deux
et avec un canal plus clair
et tout aussi résistant.
Placez ce petit coquin à trois mètres
de n'importe quelle conservation,
et ça sonnera comme
du Hendrix à vos oreilles ébahies.
- Combien ça coûte ?
- Mille cinq cents dollars.
Mais pour des officiers assermentés, je
réévalue le prix à mille deux cent cinquante.
- Tu le prends ?
- Je le prends.
Il a dit que ça coûtait
mille deux cent cinquante dollars.
On peut faire un test ou non ?
Un test grandeur nature dans
l'environnement du crime urbain moderne ?
Vous me laissez une carte de crédit
et vous le testez quarante-huit heures.
Vous aimez pas, vous ramenez.
Pas de problème.
- Je peux consulter mon équipier ?
- Mais je vous en prie.
T'as une carte de crédit ?
- Pas toi ?
- Je suis au max du max, mon pote.
Écoute, ça fait des jours et des jours
qu'on essaie d'avoir un flag,
et depuis tout ce temps,
on n'a toujours pas avancé d'un cheveu.
D'accord ? On le prend juste pour quarante-
huit heures. On fait le coup et on l'emmène.
Je n'ai fait que donner
un bureau à votre homme. C'est tout.
Vous lui avez donné un palace.
La cible de Moreland me semble
être la même que la vôtre, n'est-ce pas ?
- Non.
- Si.
Vous pourriez très bien prendre en charge
les quatorze homicides
et faire en sorte que cette demi enquête à la
con devienne quelque chose de costaud.
Je serai direct. Solutionnez nos meurtres,
nos stats vont monter et je vous aimerai.
Sinon, je m'arrangerai pour que la criminelle
ne soit pas la seule à supporter
un taux de réussite aussi faible.
Vous voyez, je ne peux pas perdre.
- C'est non.
- Allons, lieutenant.
Vous savez qu'une bonne action
n'est jamais oubliée.
Moi, j'essaie de me sortir de ma cave
avec quelque chose de simple et de clair.
Des descentes dans le monde de la drogue
et de la prostitution,
et Burrell m'oublie.
Désolé, colonel.
Vous gardez vos meurtres,
et moi, je garde le cul au chaud.
Il est moins con qu'il en a l'air.
- Et votre copain, où il est ?
- Qui ça ?
- Le Black, le mec de la Crim, où il est ?
- L'affaire est classée, d'après ce que je sais.
Oui ?
Oui. Vous n'avez rien apporté de neuf
et personne sur le bateau non plus, alors.
Ils m'ont renvoyée ici
et sont partis sur autre chose.
- Retour aux bonnes vieilles habitudes.
- Eh oui, le train-train.
Sauf que je serai pas trop sur Patapsco
ou North Point dorénavant.
À partir de demain,
je suis sur les quais de Fairfield.
À Fairfield ?
Les boss veulent une autre voiture
autour des usines chimiques.
À cause du terrorisme, sûrement.
Vous êtes bien trop jolie
pour les quais de Fairfield, très chère.
On serait bien contents si vous restiez ici.
Alors, si je comprends bien,
t'as eu des galons Sud Est.
Tu peux même pas obtenir la camionnette
de Valchek pour bosser sur son enquête ?
Je l'ai même jamais vu, cet engin.
- Bien au chaud.
- Le micro.
Sous son chapeau.
Allez, go !
JT RÉPARATIONS AUTOMOBILES
- C'est hypnotisant, cette connerie.
- Hypnotisant et ennuyeux.
Alors, vous avez fait votre cinéma ?
Oui, je me suis arrangée pour que tout
le monde me voie dans ma jolie voiture.
C'est le Valparaiso ?
Branchez-vous plutôt avec un bateau de la
Talco. Horseface travaille pas sur ce bateau.
Vous avez déjà perdu
une demi-journée devant cet écran.
- On devrait être en train de boire un coup.
- J'ai rien perdu du tout.
J'essaie de comprendre comment ça marche.
À quoi ça ressemble sans merde.
- Alors le jour où on volera un container...
- Je le verrai tout de suite.
ROTTERDAM : Le Futur du Management
des Cargaisons est défini.
Messieurs, s'il vous plaît. S'il vous plaît.
Le futur, c'est aujourd'hui.
Pour amener des biens dans une économie
globale en pleine expansion
et pour livrer ces biens rapidement,
sûrement et à moindre prix,
la robotique moderne fait le gros du travail
à Rotterdam, le plus grand port du monde.
Gérer les cargaisons
est un savoir-faire des Hollandais,
qui font transiter leur fret deux à trois fois
plus vite que n'importe quel pays au monde.
Leur avance technologique
est en train de modeler le futur.
Des tas de containers
sont déchargés et réorientés chaque jour,
vingt-quatre heures sur vingt-quatre,
et ce, dans un délai remarquablement court.
Tout un réseau de cartes intelligentes
fournit à la fois sécurité
et fiabilité, évitant ainsi
toute surveillance humaine aléatoire.
Tu vois. C'est bien ça.
Putain, Frog. On s'est tiré cinq capsules.
C'est pas un drame ! Tu piques ta crise
sur rien, t'as mal dormi ou quoi ?
C'est une histoire de principe, man.
Putain, c'est comme si tu bossais
dans un magasin.
Tu fais la caisse le soir,
il doit y avoir le compte.
Il y a Mad qui se pointe demain
avec du nouveau matos,
faut que le compte soit juste, OK ?
No problème.
Carver ?
La technologie, c'est quand même bandant.
... Les systèmes de positionnement
guident chaque container
à son emplacement désigné,
à bord et sur les quais,
tandis que des ordinateurs suivent
les marchandises à travers le monde...
Certains des systèmes
que vous voyez là ont déjà été améliorés.
Rotterdam gère aujourd'hui
trois cent cinquante millions de tonnes
de cargaison par an, laissant
Singapour à des années-lumière.
Il travaille combien d'heures,
un manutentionnaire à Rotterdam ?
Bien, je n'ai pas de chiffre récent, désolé.
Mais, Rotterdam emploie
quatre mille personnes.
Quatre mille personnes pour déplacer
trois cent cinquante millions de tonnes ?
- Par an ! Je confirme.
- Ça, c'est l'efficacité, Nat.
Et en éliminant les travaux
les plus dangereux,
La technologie des Hollandais
a permis de réduire
Les accidents du travail et les blessés
de soixante pour cent.
Ce qui, je suppose,
devrait tous vous réjouir.
Une question ? Oui ?
Les lectures GPS sont-elles fiables...
Tu risques pas de te faire mal
quand tu bosses pas.
Oui, ils savent gérer
toutes les tailles et par tous les temps.
J'arrive.
- Salut, Jackie.
- String ?
On a de la nourriture
pour au moins trois veillées.
Comment va Brianna ? Elle est derrière ?
Ça va, bonhomme ?
Tu tiens le coup ?
Bri ?
ALIMENTS GRILLES
PRODUITS DE CONSOMMATION COURANTE
- Alors, Nicky ? Des jours cette semaine ?
- Nan.
Il y a eu quatre bateaux, jeudi.
T'aurais pu récupérer un jour.
Ton dû sur les deux dernières livraisons.
Ta part plus le fric que Frog te doit.
C'est pour toi, mec.
- Ça devrait te faire plaisir, il y a quoi ?
- Il n'y a rien.
Qu'est-ce qu'il a dit, Frog ?
"Tiens, voilà deux cents billets de plus
pour calmer un peu ce grand couillon" ?
Ces livraisons, c'était mon truc à moi, Nick.
Fait chier, car ça aussi,
tu le gères mieux que moi.
Zig, on se fait du fric, c'est ce qui compte.
Non, toi tu fais du fric.
Fais chier.
J'ai d'autres soucis pour l'instant.
Paternité ?
Priscilla Katlow.
Non, Ziggy. T'as tiré Priscilla Katlow ?
Oui, et une seule fois en plus.
Katlow, tu parles. Mais tout le monde
l'a tirée au moins une fois, ici.
Comment tu sais que c'est le tien ?
T'as appelé cet avocat ?
Je me suis dit qu'il valait mieux
que je me bourre avant.
C'est pas un mauvais plan.
CLUB DORE POUR MESSIEURS
- Des Russes ?
- Un vrai nid, et joli en plus.
Oui, en tout cas,
il y en a pas mal qui ont un drôle d'accent.
On dirait que l'amie de Shardene nous
a donné un bon tuyau. Qui s'en charge ?
Ben, les proprios du Club, j'imagine.
Sinon, j'ai vu une femme
aller dans une pièce derrière.
Elle avait l'air un peu plus âgée.
J'ai pas réussi à m'approcher
suffisamment pour en dire plus.
Disons qu'elle avait la quarantaine.
Bon. Au fait, t'as eu le temps
de tirer un coup ?
J'essaie de te dire que je crois
avoir fait le meilleur des choix.
- Pour nous.
- Pour nous ?
Quand j'étais dans mon sous-sol,
de bazarder tout ça avait du sens.
Mais quand Burrell est arrivé...
Mais Burrell est l'un de ceux que tu as
contré. C'est inscrit dans un coin de sa tête.
Et sans parler de tout ce qu'il sait
sur toi depuis le début de ta carrière.
Des abrutis qui ont la moitié de ton âge
vont être nommés commandant ou colonel
quand tu te demanderas encore
si résoudre une enquête te sauvera !
Je sais que mes enquêtes
ne changeront rien. Je le sais.
Tout à l'heure,
Rawls m'a fait venir dans ses locaux.
Il m'a demandé de m'occuper des meurtres
de ces filles tuées dans le container.
J'ai dit qu'il n'en était pas question.
C'est une enquête de loser.
Ce que je veux comme enquête,
c'est la meilleure,
et je vais amener à Burrell
exactement ce qu'il m'a demandé,
exactement ce dont il a besoin
pour que Valchek lui foute la paix.
Rien de plus. Rien de moins.
Cette fois, je vais jouer au même jeu qu'eux.
Écoute. On sait tous ce que tu fais
pour obtenir le dragage.
Et fêlé comme tu l'es,
on peut laisser glisser un moment,
mais là, mec, t'en demande beaucoup trop.
Une année de plus, Nat.
- Pas pour moi, pour le syndicat.
- Les élections ont été planifiées.
Tu savais l'année dernière
quand on t'a donné nos voix,
qu'après, ce serait le tour de Ott.
Tu le savais.
Alors Ott dirigera la prochaine fois
et ces deux années de suite.
C'est notre tour, Frank.
Black, Blanc,
tu la fais comment, la différence ?
Tant qu'on aura pas fait draguer ce canal,
on sera des nègres. Excuse mon langage.
Ou tout Polack. Excuse le mien.
Tu vois très bien ce que je veux dire,
il ne s'agit pas d'Ott.
Je veux juste une année de plus
pour finir ce que j'ai commencé.
Juste une. Ott deviendra trésorier pour
les deux années suivantes. Aucun problème.
Réfléchis-y.
- Allô ?
- Bruce, mon petit loup.
- Frankie ! Comment ça se passe ?
- Tu as pu discuter avec le Président ?
Un paquet de filles et un paquet de muscles.
Zig, arrête. Zig ?
- Quand est-ce que tu l'as eu, ce truc ?
- Je l'ai trouvé ce matin dans ma boîte.
- Dans ta boîte ?
- Oui, ce matin.
Quand Pokey Barber a eu ses emmerdes,
Le shérif a dû se pointer chez lui
pour lui remettre les papiers.
Dolorès, je peux utiliser le téléphone ?
- Putain, t'appelles qui ?
- Je veux entendre l'avocat de cette pute.
Quoi ? T'as disjoncté, il n'y a pas de bureau
d'avocats ouvert en pleine nuit.
Allô, cabinet Glaudu, j'écoute.
- Il t'a eu, cousin.
- Qui m'a eu ?
Maui ?
Enfant illégitime, qui n'était pas prévu
Enfant illégitime, né dans la pauvreté
Enfant illégitime, qui n'était pas prévu
Non, mademoiselle, il n'y a pas de toilettes
dans le hall et de toute façon,
si vous n'êtes pas une invitée,
je n'ai pas le droit de vous laisser entrer.
D'accord.
Mais dites-moi, quand vous avez envie,
vous allez où ?
Excusez-moi, monsieur ?
Vous êtes résident ?
S'il vous plaît.
Non, pardon, on s'est trompés.
Sixième étage. Tous.
Thomas "Horseface" Pakusa,
désigné responsable du déchargement
de l'Esméralda,
ligne E.T.A., demain midi, mouillage six,
au terminal Patapsco.
- Cette fois, on y est.
- Il nous faut de l'aide pour la surveillance.
Sur les quais en particulier.
On a des gueules connues, là-bas.
Je pourrais contacter Greggs et Prez
et tenter de nous les ramener sur le coup.
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
On le dit au lieutenant ?
Pour l'instant, moins le Lieutenant
se souvient qu'il a une affaire de meurtre
sur les bras, et plus il est content.
Une nouvelle caisse ?
Et alors, j'emmerde quelqu'un ?
Ça marche bien pour toi ici, non ?
- Putain, tu l'as dit.
- Et alors, grâce à qui ?
Ce mec est une sorte de fournisseur,
prends des clichés des plaques de voiture.
- T'as quelque chose pour moi ?
- Oui, si t'as ce qui faut de ton côté.
Comme tu gères le truc, c'est cool. Ça avait
pas aussi bien marché depuis longtemps.
Merde !
Je te jure avec toi, j'irais au bout du monde.
T'es trop réglo, je te jure. Tu trouves ?
Sûr, on te fait pas d'embrouilles,
tu fais pas chier.
Tu vas la bouger, ta caisse.
Non, c'est pas vrai !
Non, non, non. Putain, non !
On a parlé avec le service
technique, on travaillera sur le canal 6.
Prez, tu quittes pas des yeux la sortie.
Et tu te positionnes
de façon à pouvoir partir dans n'importe
quelle direction sur l'autoroute.
Bunk, tu te mets en place
à l'intersection Newkirk Broening :
Russell et moi, on reste sur l'ordinateur,
ce qui laisse les quais à Kima.
Ils connaissent peut-être pas ma tête là-bas,
mais ça peut quand même mal tourner.
Je pensais emprunter le camion
C.G.E. des Stups, ce serait rassurant.
En plus d'un petit casque jaune
sur la tête et d'un bloc note.
Et s'il ne détournait aucune marchandise ?
Il se passe quoi ?
Alors, il se passerait que tragiquement,
nous aurions gâché une journée de plus
dans cette pauvre vie
que nous avons déjà joyeusement gaspillée.
- Rien de vivant là-dedans, j'espère.
- Si jamais tu sens le moindre lézard,
tu retournes au container
et tu tapes dessus pour t'en assurer.
J'ai aucune confiance en ces tarés de Grecs.
- Et alors, ça va, toi ?
- Oui. Ça va bien.
T'as pas trop bossé ces derniers temps.
Reste avec nous, Nick. Reste avec nous.
Fais rien que je ne ferais pas.
Jésus au bout du fil
Dis-lui ce que tu veux
Oh, Jésus au bout du fil
Dis-lui ce que tu veux
Jésus au bout du fil
Dis-lui ce que tu veux
Famille
Appelle-le et dis-lui ce que tu veux
Si tu désires le salut
Dis-lui ce que tu veux
Oh, si tu désires le salut
Dis-lui ce que tu veux
Si tu désires le salut
Dis-lui ce que tu veux
Appelle-le et dis-lui ce que tu veux
Oh, appelle-le, appelle-le
Dis-lui ce que tu veux
Oh, appelle-le, appelle-le
Dis-lui ce que tu veux
Appelle-le, appelle-le
Dis-lui ce que tu veux
Jésus au bout du fil
T'as mis le deux deux un ?
Ça rend super bien.
Toutes mes condoléances.
Vous l'avez bien accompagné.
C'est un des plus chouettes
enterrements que j'aie vu.
- Et pourtant, t'en as vu un paquet, je sais.
- Oui, ça, j'en ai vu.
Voilà, je sais que ce n'est ni le lieu
ni le moment,
mais j'aurais besoin de te parler
quelques minutes.
- J'ai une proposition à te faire.
- Va jusqu'à ta voiture.
En vérité, tu vas vite comprendre
que je suis pas vraiment hors sujet.
Côté Ouest, la dope est plutôt
mauvaise en ce moment.
Tous les junkies savent qu'Avon leur
fourgue de la merde. Pas de la poudre.
Le plus triste là-dedans, c'est que vous êtes
implanté dans le meilleur quartier de la ville.
La Terrasse, les Tours basses,
l'Avenue et ce qui a autour.
Je respecte le fait que dans ton monde,
on sache utiliser le langage, man,
mais je t'en supplie,
dis-moi quelque chose que j'ignore.
Laisse-moi te préciser un truc.
Ma dope c'est du miel, String.
C'est une dope qui se pointe
direct à Baltimore et qui est presque pure.
À quatre-vingt-cinq, quatre-vingt-dix
pour cent. Et tu sais que c'est vrai.
La moitié de tes zombies se ramène
à Fallsway deux fois par jour,
parce que côté Est, la dope est bien
meilleure que dans ton secteur.
- Alors, t'as une connexion ?
- La merde, elle descend direct du bateau.
Je vais même pas à New York,
sauf pour la coke. C'est plus la peine.
L'histoire, c'est que vous avez
le meilleur territoire et aucun produit.
J'ai le meilleur produit. Mais j'ai
un territoire qui a toutes les raisons
de s'agrandir, tu vois où je veux en venir.
Joe, tu sais à quel point Avon
s'est battu pour avoir ces tours.
Il a fallu se débarrasser des Frères Rayford
de Big Dennis Woodson, c'est pas si...
Merde, c'est le business, man.
Tu paies un dollar, tu vends deux.
Ça a toujours été comme ça. Vous avez
les tours, moi ce qui doit y entrer.
Alors, il n'y a pas d'autre baratin à se faire.
- J'en parlerai à Avon.
- Fais-le, mon frère. Fais-le.
Je sais encore lire un bilan comptable.
Il n'y a rien dedans pour le dragage.
Eh oui, baisse des revenus. Le Gouverneur
cherche à limiter les emprunts,
- mais le quai à grain est d'actualité.
- Le reste, c'est de la tchatche ?
Parler c'est bon.
Parler, Frank, c'est un début.
Parler, ça résume assez bien ton boulot.
Blah. Blah. Blah. Blah. Blah. Blah.
C'est comme si tu disais que les contrôleurs
ne font qu'entrer des chiffres dans un ordi.
Ton fils. L'aîné,
il va dans quelle école, maintenant ?
- Jason ? À Princeton.
- À Princeton.
Et quand il aura son diplôme, il fera quoi ?
- Il fera ce qu'il veut.
- Bien.
Tu as envoyé à Princeton ton fils aîné
pour qu'il fasse ce qu'il veut.
Un jour, quand on était gosses,
le père de Danny Hare a volé deux caisses
de vieux cognac dans un bateau.
Seulement, en rentrant chez lui, il a vu
que c'était pas du cognac. C'était du Tang.
- Du Tang ?
- Ça venait de sortir.
La télé disait que les cosmonautes
buvaient ça en allant sur la Lune.
- Tu le bois, donc...
- Toi aussi, tu deviens cosmonaute.
Tout l'été, c'est tout ce que les gosses
de Danny Hare ont bu.
Tang au petit-déjeuner, Tang à midi.
Tang la nuit quand ils se réveillaient
parce qu'ils avaient la trouille.
Et tu crois qu'ils sont devenus
quoi en grandissant ?
Manutentionnaires.
Ça t'ouvre pas les yeux, toi ?
Moi, ça me raconte que Jason DiBiago
va prendre son pied
à brasser des thunes comme son père.
Tu vas trop loin, Frank.
Mon arrière-grand-père
aiguisait des couteaux. Oui.
Il poussait son chariot sur Preston Street
jusqu'à Alice-Ann,
avec une jambe atrophiée
à force de pomper sa roue.
Il avait pas envie
que ses fils poussent ce putain de truc.
Il s'est battu
pour que mon grand-père étudie.
Et mon père, plus tard,
a eu accès à l'université.
Tu parles de comme c'était dans le temps.
Je te parle d'aujourd'hui.
Ce qui comptait, c'est qui était ton père
et ensuite quand tu avais des enfants,
c'est qui était ton fils.
Mais après le film d'horreur de tout
à l'heure... Des robots plein les quais,
avec leurs putains de robots partout,
mon fils aura de la veine s'ils ont besoin
de contrôleurs dans cinq ans.
Même si je me fous de pas pouvoir amener
mon couteau à aiguiser chez DiBiago et fils,
ça me fend le coeur qu'il n'y ait aucun avenir
pour les Sobotka sur ces putains de quais.
Tiens, je crois que c'est ta pointure.
Ce geste suppose, bien entendu, que grâce
à ta conscience professionnelle,
les fonds pour les quais à grain
seront débloqués.
Mais je veux qu'on approfondisse le canal.
Alors, toi, tu vas leur parler du canal.
Et tous les gros bras des bureaux
vont devoir se mettre à parler du canal
jusqu'à ce que cette foutue connerie
soit draguée
et que ces putains de bateaux arrivent.
C'est bon, vas-y ! C'est bon.
- Il y en a un qui a disparu.
- Quel est son numéro ?
- Onze trente-sept à douze quatorze.
- J'écoute.
- On en a un. Tu prends note ?
- Envoie.
Zoulou, Tango, Golf, Roméo,
neuf, sept, trois, deux, six, cinq
et neuf souligné.
Bien reçu. Je l'ai juste devant les yeux.
- Onze quatre-vingt-dix-neuf.
- Onze quatre-vingt-dix-neuf.
On en a un en direct. Tiens-toi prêt.
- Je suis censé voir quoi, au juste ?
- On te le dira.
Je vois un homme de race blanche.
Gilet de sécurité orange
et bleu de travail.
Il est en train de fixer la boîte
sur je sais pas comment on dit.
OK, bien reçu. Ensuite ?
Deux possibilités.
Soit notre chauffeur passe le contrôle,
ça peut vouloir dire que Horseface
a entré un mauvais numéro de container
et qu'alors, ils s'en apercevront,
soit il sort en douce.
Et s'il sort en douce,
alors c'est à nous de jouer.
Onze trente-sept à douze quatorze.
Kima garde-le en ligne de mire
jusqu'à ce qu'il quitte le parc.
Dis-nous s'il s'arrête au contrôle
ou s'il continue sa route.
Bien reçu.
Douze quatorze.
Il contourne le contrôle. À vous.
- Onze quatre-vingt-dix-neuf.
- Quatre-vingt-dix-neuf.
La cible arrive sur toi, tu la vois ?
Je l'ai, il se dirige vers l'Ouest
par la ville.
Onze trente-sept à onze trente-quatre.
Bien reçu.
- La cible s'approche de toi.
- Onze trente-quatre, bien reçu.
Attention, on est sur Newkirk.
- Il est à toi, Bunk.
- Bien reçu.
- Onze trente-quatre. Tu le quittes pas.
- Bien reçu.
- Onze trente-quatre ?
- Trente-quatre, j'écoute.
Il s'est arrêté à côté de Newkirk
dans une sorte d'entrepôt.
Laisse-moi une minute.
Je fais demi-tour et je me mets en planque.
Bon, c'est bien un entrepôt.
Le nom : Pyramid Incorporated,
cinquante-six zéro cinq Newkirk.
OK, bien reçu.
Brianna, putain.
Elle te met tout sur le dos, hein ?
Avon, tu savais qu'il en prenait ?
Tu sais, j'ai vu, mais j'ai pas vu, quoi.
J'ai vraiment cru
qu'il avait arrêté cette merde.
Et bien avant qu'on ait fait le coup
avec le maton. C'est pour ça que...
Fais chier.
On l'a accompagné à sa dernière demeure.
C'était un bel enterrement.
- Ouais ?
- Ouais. Tout le monde est venu.
- Comment va Brianna ?
- Dur.
Tu sais, personne ne veut
que des choses comme ça arrivent.
Si j'avais su que le gosse
allait faire une connerie pareille.
- Merde, tu vois quoi ?
- Qu'est-ce qui circule dans la taule ?
Qu'est-ce qu'ils disent
qu'il s'est pendu comme ça ?
Ouais, qu'il a juste fait un noeud
à une corde. Et qu'il s'est laissé tomber.
Avon, comment tu veux empêcher un gamin
de faire ce genre de connerie, hein ?
Comment tu veux faire ?
Tu veux quoi, rester avec lui tout le temps,
tous les jours, chaque minute ?
Il aurait trouvé un moyen
s'il le voulait vraiment.
Tu n'y es pour rien.
Pour rien du tout. Ou je te le dirais
si c'était le cas, fais-moi confiance.
Comment ça se passe pour l'autre truc ?
C'est la même merde. Ton mec à Atlanta, il y
connaît rien de la bonne, il en a jamais vu.
- On tire le prix ?
- Moi, j'ai une gueule de supermarché ?
- Essaie de comprendre...
- Comprendre quoi ? C'est ridicule.
Tu changes l'emballage, man.
Et tu le refourgues.
Bon, Proposition Joe,
il s'est pointé à l'enterrement.
Il m'a pris à part. Il a un filon.
Tout le monde sait qu'il a un filon
et il veut partager avec nous. Si on lui
donne un bout de territoire, dans les tours.
- Non, c'est une idée. On peut...
- Non, c'est pas une idée. Non !
Je vais te dire un truc,
on va traverser tout ça. Toute cette merde.
- Je sais.
- Tu comprends ? Tout ça !
Quelque chose a bougé ?
S'il y avait des filles dans cette caisse,
elles sont toujours à l'intérieur.
- La D.N.R. est sur quoi ?
- Les téléphones des syndicats de dockers,
sur les bureaux et les téléphones
personnels de quelques officiels.
Là. Le neuf cent cinquante-huit, dix-sept,
trente-sept. Le numéro de Thomas Pakusa.
Le quatre février de cette année
et le seize mars,
ce cher Monsieur Pakusa a reçu un appel
du portable de Frank Sobotka.
Les deux fois, il bosse sur un bateau
de la Talco le jour suivant.
Et les deux fois, il manque
une caisse dans l'ordinateur.
Ceci semble démontrer
que nous avons affaire à un réseau.
- Et un réseau qui ferait quoi ?
- Du trafic de merde.
Du trafic de quoi ?
Pour commencer, du trafic de filles
pour des réseaux de prostitution.
- Ça, on le sait. On en est sûrs.
- Il faut faire mieux pour obtenir une écoute.
Relisez votre code. Le texte sur les écoutes,
en particulier. Article dix, quatre zéro six.
Les crimes donnant droit à une interception
des communications téléphoniques
dans l'État du Maryland.
La prostitution, niet.
Vous voulez dire qu'on peut piéger la ligne
de quelqu'un s'il vend de la drogue,
mais qu'il est hors-jeu
s'il vend des femmes ?
Oui, c'est la loi.
Chérie ? C'est moi.
Trouve-nous un bel appart
avec deux chambres.
- On peut payer.
- Comment ?
- J'ai un nouveau boulot.
- En dehors des docks ?
Environ trois, quatre jours par semaine.
Je bosse dans un entrepôt pour un Grec.
Il a un magasin d'électroménagers
sur l'Highland Town.
J'irai travailler en plus
des heures que je fais sur les docks.
Combien, Nick ?
Approche. Approche.
Environ cinq cents la semaine.
Peut-être plus.
Mais ce qui est sûr, c'est que cette fois,
c'est du solide.
Si on ajoute ce que tu gagnes
avec tes ciseaux et cet argent,
on peut se payer notre bagnole.
Et on aura encore assez pour se payer
un bel endroit en dehors de la ville.
Mille cinq cents dollars !
Mille deux cent cinquante
avec la réduction police.
Cette technologie n'a pas résisté
au crime urbain moderne.
OK. Ralentis. On y est.
Elle appartient à Nicholas Andrew Sobotka.
1485 Reynold Street.
- Sobotka ?
- C'est ce qui est écrit là-dedans.
T'as pas un petit flash là, non ? Manix ?
Je te signale que c'est le même nom
que le mec sur qui on enquête.
Frank Sobotka.
Non, là, c'est Nicholas.
Va te faire foutre, même à Polakland,
je te parie qu'il n'y en a pas trente-six.
- Tu sais ce que ça veut dire ?
- Quoi ?
Ça veut dire que ce vieux truc poilu
pas très en forme
va vraiment nous rapporter un max
si on apprend à le dompter un petit peu.
- Hors de question.
- T'as pas mille deux cent cinquante ?
Car relier une affaire de drogue
à notre cible principale, ça vaut
une centaine de biftons en rab
en fin de mois.
Écoute, si c'est moi qui prends l'histoire en
charge, Daniels va penser qui a un lézard.
Si c'est toi, ça va le faire.
T'as trop le look du mec de confiance.
C'est à toi de le faire.
Il n'y a que toi qui peux faire ça.
- Moi ?
- Il faut que t'amènes le lieutenant,
son enquête, ses hommes
et le matériel qui va avec.
Lester, Daniels t'écoute.
Tu l'as déjà testé, non ?
Il émane de toi comme une odeur
de sagesse, mon frère.
- Ici-bas, on a tous notre rôle à jouer.
- C'est quoi ton rôle, à toi ?
Celui d'un humble fils de pute
avec une grosse bite de nase.
Tu serais pas en train
de te surestimer un peu ?
OK, t'as raison.
En fait, je suis pas si humble que ça.
Ben, ça c'est incroyable. Tu peux fermer !
Je jure que s'il remet encore
cette putain de chanson,
je lui éclate la gueule.
Tu peux le battre, Zig.
Il fait gros, mais il l'est pas. Il frime,
mais c'est quoi au fond, ce gonze ?
Une merde.
Toi, t'es une légende sur les docks, Zig.
Que tu le veuilles ou non, t'es une légende.
Je peux me le faire, tu crois ?
À l'aise.
- On a un blessé, sur le quai cinq !
- Qui ?
New Charles.
- Merde ! On a appelé l'ambulance.
- Bon Dieu !
Faire ce boulot de nuit, Frank,
ça devrait pas exister.
- Les mecs, vous allez bouger cette merde ?
- Bordel de Dieu !
Faut pas bouger un blessé, Frank.
C'est ça, on s'en souviendra
quand ce sera ton tour.
Arrêtez de vous branler
et enlevez ce truc de ma jambe !
Un, deux, trois !
Tiens, Charlie. Tire une taffe.
C'est l'ambulance, Charlie.
Tu l'entends, l'ambulance.
Bonsoir. Il est là, par terre.
T'en fais pas, mon gars, t'es toujours en vie.
Frank, qu'est-ce qu'elle donne, ma jambe ?
- C'est quelle jambe, déjà ?
- Monsieur, vous entendez ma voix ?
Serrez ma main.
Attention, monsieur. On y va.
S'il vous plaît, dégagez le passage, les gars.
- Et vous avez suivi le véhicule ?
- Oui, jusqu'à l'entrepôt.
- La surveillance est en place ?
- Kima est en position.
Cette enquête vaut que vous y bossiez,
lieutenant.
Je sais que ça a débuté
comme une enquête de merde,
mais ce Sobotka est sur un coup
qui nécessite réellement de bons flics.
Les écoutes, les clonages d'ordi.
On a le feu vert.
Rawls est venu me voir.
- Il voudrait que je m'occupe des homicides.
- Vous devriez.
Ces filles du container ont été étouffées,
elles sont mortes dans cette putain de boîte.
Si vous prenez le dossier,
vous allez vraiment bouffer du meurtre.
Mais si vous laissez passer,
alors vous allez avoir du mal à continuer
à vivre ce que vous vivez.
De la part des gars du quinze quatorze.
Il tient le coup ? Il a l'air solide.
Tu sais d'où il tire son nom, New Charles ?
De son premier jour de travail, du jour même
où Paceco a fait tomber un panneau
sur Charlie Bannion.
Il a fallu virer
le corps de Charlie à la pelle.
Alors depuis ce jour-là, c'est New Charles.
Elle est perdue, sa jambe.
D'où il venait, cet argent ?
Je prends vos meurtres. Mais tout ce dont
j'ai besoin, vous me le donnez !
Sans m'emmerder et sans discuter.
Sans discuter.
- T'uses toutes les piles !
- Et alors ?
Maman, Michael, il use toutes les piles !
Les enfants, vous vous arrangez tous les
deux ou je démonte la tente tout de suite.
- Fayot.
- Petit con.
- Pédé.
- Branleur.
- Gros nase.
- Mais où est-ce qu'ils apprennent tout ça ?
C'est à moi, maintenant.
Allez, passe, je vais faire des ombres.
Elena.
Non, non.
J'ai pas confiance en toi.
Je peux avoir des sentiments pour toi.
Je peux souhaiter que nous devenions amis.
Et si tu me donnes assez de temps, alors
peut-être même que j'aurai envie
que tu sois un peu plus heureux.
Mais dis-moi, comment
je peux te faire confiance ?
Maman ! Vite ! Il y a une araignée !
C'est une grosse poilue.
- Mon Dieu.
- Viens vite, maman.
Si les enquêtes se recoupent réellement,
j'aurais au moins la bénédiction de Rawls.
C'est un sérieux coup de pouce.
Est-ce que tu entends ce que tu dis ?
J'aime mon boulot, Marla.
- Je peux pas m'en empêcher.
- Ton boulot, lui, il t'aime pas.
Tu sais ce que j'aime en toi ?
C'est cet esprit qui a toujours
une longueur d'avance sur moi.
Cette lumière qui semble
traverser quelque chose.
C'est d'elle dont je suis tombé
amoureux en premier.
Tu sais de quoi je suis tombée amoureuse
en premier ? Tu le sais ?
De ton ambition.
Qu'est-elle devenue aujourd'hui ?
Bonjour, nous ne sommes pas là,
laissez-nous un message.
Elena, allez, parle-moi.
C'est fini, le téléphone.
C'est fini, le téléphone.
Pourquoi Elena...
Pourquoi elle est chiante ?
- Permettez.
- Eh, vous là... Doucement.
Tout va bien... Tout va bien.
Un autre, s'il te plaît.
- Et si t'en laissais un peu pour les autres ?
- Sers-moi !
- Tu vas quand même pas prendre le volant.
- Non, j'ai appelé un taxi.
Je te le dis droit dans les yeux, Gus,
je ne conduis pas ma voiture ce soir.
Fais chier !
Donnez-moi un café.
- Qu'est-ce que vous avez à la main ?
- Une égratignure.
Et puis des oeufs, s'il vous plaît.
- Je peux avoir un bout de viande ?
- Tout ce que vous voulez.
Oui ! Oh oui !
SUR ÉCOUTE
"Comment ça se fait qu'ils ne s'envolent pas ?"
- Ziggy
Regarde comme il roule des mécaniques.
Tu vas pas laisser ce connard faire la loi.
Après ce qu'il t'a fait.
Je lui botterais le cul si c'était moi.
Il est bâti comme une armoire à glace.
Maui n'a rien d'un athlète. Ses vêtements
donnent cette impression, Zig.
- Ah, tu crois ?
- Il a les muscles en fromage blanc.
Toi, t'es une légende !
La légende des docks.
Écoute, tu tapes dessus de toutes tes forces
et ensuite tu te casses tranquillement.
Officiellement, nous enquêtons
sur les quatorze meurtres non élucidés.
Soit on sort une affaire du tonnerre de Dieu,
soit je suis aussi con
que le pense le commandant Rawls.
Vous avez l'air un peu pessimiste.
Pas totalement.
Lester, éclaire Mademoiselle Pearlman
sur l'avancement de notre enquête.
Vous aviez dit que pour obtenir des écoutes
il fallait un lien avec la drogue, c'est ça ?
Venez voir par ici.
Voilà le listing des numéros
enregistrés sur le téléphone de l'entrepôt
où nous avons localisé le conteneur.
On y trouve des appels passés vers
des numéros qui sont ceux de Petey Dixon,
Proposition Joe Stewart
et "White Mike" McArdle,
ainsi que d'autres trafiquants
du quartier Est.
C'est corroboré par le repérage de dealers
notoires entrant et sortant de l'entrepôt.
Ainsi que par des clients
d'individus surveillés et photographiés
par la brigade des stupéfiants du Sud Est
et qui relient White Mike aux revendeurs
à qui nous avons déjà fait
des achats photographiés.
En admettant qu'il y ait tout,
ça fait une écoute à l'entrepôt.
- Des présomptions sur le chauffeur ?
- Sergei Malatov.
Résident étranger. D'origine ukrainienne.
Pas d'antécédents judiciaires ici.
On l'a identifié grâce
au contrat de location de camion.
Sympa, il a donné son numéro
de portable à la société de location.
Et la surveillance du portable
a révélé un appel à l'entrepôt
au moment où Kima le voyait sur le dock
en train de téléphoner.
En vérifiant sur le listing,
on a retrouvé sept appels
depuis ce portable aux dates
et aux heures où des containers
disparaissent sur le Talco.
Rien d'autre ?
Pour l'autre écoute, c'est un peu léger.
Et ce Nicolas du bloc quatorze cent
sur Reynolds Street ?
Renseignés par un informateur,
Herc et Carver l'ont suivi
depuis un rendez-vous
avec un dealer dans Fayette Street
jusqu'au Sud de Baltimore chez ses parents.
On a cherché leur numéro
depuis l'adresse du listing
de l'entrepôt et on n'a rien trouvé.
Mais quand on a fouillé
dans le portable de notre ami Sergueï,
- là, on a fait mouche.
- Sobotka étant votre objectif déclaré ?
Lui, c'est un neveu. À ce qu'on en voit,
il serait dans la vente de stupéfiants
et la contrebande.
Mais pour l'instant, cette affaire paraît
plus grosse que celle de Frank.
- Sans vouloir offenser Stan Valchek.
- Bon.
Je l'admets. Il y a des présomptions.
Sur la ligne de l'entrepôt
et sur le portable du camionneur aussi.
Maintenant, qu'est-ce qui vous manque
pour conclure ?
N'importe quel informateur.
- On n'a rien sur les docks.
- Personne avec qui acheter gros.
- Et la surveillance ?
- Elle nous a menés devant la porte,
mais elle ne nous introduira pas
dans l'entrepôt.
Commencez vos rapports. J'appelle le juge.
Un sandwich jambon fromage
et puis un frappuccino.
- Y paraît que Charles a perdu sa jambe.
- Quoi ?
Un frappuccino ? C'est quoi, cette merde ?
C'est une tapette, Zig. Assomme-le.
Tu te le fais, Zig. C'est le moment, vas-y.
Voyez-vous ça ! Le petit merdeux
a des noix, on dirait bien.
Et une banane. Ouais.
Ah, putain de merde !
- Monte-nous, soulève !
- Putain, va te faire enculer, connard !
Va te faire foutre !
Putain de gros con, va te faire enculer !
Enculé, je t'emmerde, espèce de gros con.
Non, non, je t'emmerde !
- Et tu restes là.
- Je t'emmerde !
Bordel de merde !
Si je vois un connard qui l'aide
à descendre, il monte avec lui.
Vous m'avez poussé !
Bande d'enculés, vous l'avez fait exprès !
Oh, merde.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est que cette tenue ?
- On m'avait pas dit que c'était luxueux.
Lacrosse ?
Et alors ?
Un Black pourrait pas tenir une batte ?
Jim Brown était champs centre
des All American à Syracuse.
Tu oses te comparer à Jim Brown ?
Lester, je disais seulement que...
Je croyais que vous étiez né
avec un costume.
Lieutenant, il m'a semblé
que lorsqu'il était muté contre sa volonté
sur une affaire de drogue
qui sent le réchauffé et dont personne
n'a rien à foutre dans le secteur
comme si c'était une balle perdue,
un vétéran de la police capable et talentueux
pouvait porter ce qui lui faisait plaisir.
Jusqu'à un certain point.
- Beau lancer.
- Merci.
Ah, c'est pas rien d'enlever un policier
au centre-ville pour le perdre à la périphérie.
Installez-vous là.
J'ai déjà le mal du pays.
Qu'est-ce qui vous fait rire, les filles ?
Parle à mon cul.
T'aurais vu ce que ton gamin
a voulu soulever aujourd'hui.
Sacré Ziggy.
- Qu'est-ce que tu cherches ?
- Je trouve pas ces putains de factures.
- C'est la fin du mois, tout est en plan.
- On a un truc pour les Grecs ?
Mercredi. La Caspia arrive à Patapsco.
Nicky ira chercher les coordonnées demain.
Pas étonnant que je les trouvais pas.
Si tu t'en sers comme marque-page.
Je voudrais te poser une question importante.
Est-ce que t'aimes les faux seins ?
Moi, je sais pas.
J'arrive toujours pas à me décider
pour les faux seins.
Je croyais avoir tout connu de la paperasse,
mais ce qui faut pas faire pour écouter
des conversations téléphoniques...
Vous êtes tous nuls en orthographe.
Si on l'était pas,
on serait pas dans la police.
- Qui est le juge de permanence ?
- Vanderwal.
Vous croyez qu'il va signer ?
Pas de problème, si vous lui nettoyez
son garage ou si vous faites ses carreaux.
Vanderwal, enfoiré.
Lui faire ses carreaux ?
- Ce sont les déposants, Mlle Pearlman ?
- Oui, Votre Honneur.
Êtes-vous prêts à affirmer
que les informations contenues
dans cette déclaration sous serment
sont exactes ?
- Oui, Votre Honneur.
- Oui, Votre Honneur.
- Oui, Votre Honneur.
- Absolument.
Au-dessus, jeunes gens.
Troisième étage dans la pièce du fond.
Le châssis de la fenêtre.
Et si vous pouviez donner
un petit coup aux carreaux... Merci.
On a bien fait de réviser l'épreuve de sergent.
- Allez. Allez.
- Pardon. Pardon.
- Prénom ?
- Prénom : Francis.
Vous pourriez m'épeler votre nom,
s'il vous plaît ?
S-O-B-O-T-K-A.
C'est ça, oui.
Oui, c'est une adresse professionnelle.
- Vous avez été signalé.
- Signalé ?
- Oui ?
- C'est enregistré dans l'ordinateur.
Peu importe, d'accord.
Le chèque part demain. Promis-juré.
D'accord, demain.
Dis, cheval, tu paies pas ton téléphone
depuis trois mois, qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Coupé.
D'accord, ça fait 90 jours de retard
sur mon portable, et pourtant il se passe rien.
Avant même que je poste le chèque.
Je demande pourquoi à la charmante dame
de la facturation, et tu sais ce qu'elle me dit ?
- Vous êtes signalé.
- Signalé ?
Elle dit que c'est sur l'écran
quand mon compte apparaît :
"Ne pas couper en cas de non-paiement."
"Signalé." C'est quoi ce truc ?
Qu'est-ce que j'ai de particulier ?
T'as peut-être été touché par la grâce.
Je te l'avais dit,
que les tumbleweeds nous débarrasseraient
de cet enculé. Vas-y.
- Et aussi des camés. Ils ont tous décroché.
- Non, c'est pas ça, mec.
Ils ont plus confiance.
Faut dire qu'on vend de la merde ici, mec.
Merde.
- Allez. Pud, ça roule ?
- Aussi vite qu'un Blanc en pantoufles.
À tout à l'heure.
Yo mec, nous ici, on crève parce que ces
lâcheurs de camés ont trouvé mieux ailleurs.
Si c'est pas malheureux, quand même.
Vous avez quelque chose à faire, ici ?
- Justement, on s'occupe de nos affaires.
- Circulez.
Police d'opérette !
Ils ont acheté leurs uniformes en solde.
Il oserait même pas sortir de sa caisse
si on avait des chiens, putain !
La came est pourrie, mec.
Eh, mon vieux. Tu parles d'une nuit, hein !
Même pour un vieux cheval
de retour dans ton genre...
Lâche-moi.
Qu'est-ce qui t'arrive, bon sang ?
C'est parce qu'Elena a pas voulu
te laisser entrer que tu ouvres
tes vannes et tu fais des conneries,
c'est ça ?
Non. Allez, Jimmy. Relax.
Viens, si t'es un homme.
Vous allez avoir des écoutes
pour l'affaire des docks ?
Dans cette équipe, on retrouve à peu près
tous les glands galonnés sauf moi.
On est jaloux, petit con ?
Je préférerais retourner à la Criminelle.
Je prends ta place quand tu veux.
Pourquoi ?
- Ta baigneuse te réveille la nuit ?
- Non, mais il n'y a pas qu'elle.
Je suis pas le capitaine Chesapeake.
Faut que je quitte ce bateau.
Faut que j'enquête.
Si je peux pas, enfin...
Si je suis pas un bon...
Si c'est ça que tu veux, faut aller voir Rawls.
- Il te mettra dessus tout de suite.
- Ouais, pourquoi pas ? Ouais. Jimmy.
... après quoi, je dis à Horse
d'aller dans le parking Sud-Est
voler le truc le plus cher
qu'il pourra conduire, ce qu'il fait.
On l'emballe dans un conteneur
et on l'expédie dans n'importe quel port.
Maintenant, où il est ?
Quelque part entre la Nouvelle-Orléans
et la côte Ouest.
Qu'est-ce que tu dis de ton petit frère, hein ?
Tu m'as dit que tu devais
m'apporter quelque chose.
Oui, ça.
Lis-le.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Une genre de lettre d'accord.
Tu sais, le siège de représentant syndical au
Conseil Consultatif du Port dont je t'ai parlé.
J'ai posé ta candidature. Tu y es.
J'y suis ?
Je suis plus syndiqué depuis que le bassin
de radoub est fermé. Comment je peux y être ?
Le bureau, le président et moi,
on a de bonnes relations.
Tu les as soudoyés.
Le président se dit que ça t'irait
très bien, c'est tout.
Et il y a une indemnité
avec deux cents dollars par mois, Lou.
Quand je rentre chez moi le soir, tout ce dont
j'ai envie, c'est de voir un bon match.
J'ai plus l'énergie pour aller
à des réunions ou des trucs.
Enfin Lou, tu sais, t'as pas besoin d'aller
à toutes les réunions,
tu te montres une fois de temps en temps
pour dire que t'es vivant.
C'est pas pour moi.
Qu'est-ce qui est pour toi ?
Le tas de boue garé devant
a besoin d'une batterie.
Et cette cuisine équipée pareil
depuis vingt-cinq ans.
Quoi que j'aie, je l'ai eu honnêtement.
Mais c'est très noble, cher grand frère.
Pas noble. Juste.
Les chantiers navals font faillite
et ça devrait faire de toi un martyr ?
Ça alors, la seule différence entre toi et moi,
- c'est que t'as choisi le mauvais syndicat.
- C'est pas la seule différence.
- Tu serais à ma place, tu verrais...
- Je suis pas à ta place.
Et pour tout dire, je suis bien content
de pas avoir à faire ces choix-là.
Reviens, allez.
Assieds-toi.
Vous entraîniez des pigeons
avec mon papy ?
Tout le monde le faisait à l'époque.
J'en ai donné un à un marin hollandais
sur un bateau citerne une fois.
Il l'a relâché au milieu de l'océan.
Je parie qu'il a retrouvé
le chemin de Hull Street.
Et à ce propos, je ne pourrais pas
en dire autant de ton grand-père
quand il avait la tête dans le sac.
Comment ça se fait qu'ils ne s'envolent pas ?
Il a les ailes attachées.
Combien pour celui-là, Monsieur Diz ?
Pourquoi tu commences pas avec
des pigeons ? Faut entraîner des pigeons.
Ils ont des poux.
Ils transmettent la peste, bordel de merde !
Merci, Monsieur Diz.
J'ai essayé. Rawls le déteste.
- Il a de bonnes raisons.
- Mais Jimmy est rongé de l'intérieur.
C'est une épave
quand il ne fait pas une vraie enquête.
- Mais c'est un bon flic.
- Comme toujours.
Le truc, lieutenant,
c'est que Jimmy McNulty,
quand il fait pas son boulot de flic,
c'est une caricature d'alcoolique
autodestructeur en train de se bousiller.
Et quand il est flic,
c'est un peu le même genre d'enfoiré.
Mais sur une affaire sérieuse,
je veux dire quand il faut aller au charbon,
Là, ce gars est vraiment pas loin
d'être un mec bien.
Allez voir Rawls.
Donc, je serai payé ?
Oui, tu seras payé, mais ce sera pas toi.
Nous, on sera payés.
Alors pourquoi ils vous filent pas le fric,
comme ça ils me ficheraient la paix ?
Parce qu'on a besoin d'une information
confidentielle, numéro 238
enregistré au service.
Toi, t'es enregistré, et nous, on est payés.
- Donc vous allez vendre ma photo...
- Et ton numéro de sécurité sociale.
Et ils vous fileront du blé
que vous garderez, et moi, j'aurais rien.
Parce que toi, t'aurais fait
quelque chose qui mérite du blé ?
Et vous ?
Ouais, nous, on a fait toute la lumière
sur une affaire.
On a fourni des informations essentielles
sur un très gros trafiquant de drogue.
Voilà ce qu'on a fait, nous.
C'est jamais que votre boulot.
Vous recevez un salaire.
Bernard, tu énerves mon équipier, mec.
Qu'est-ce qui te prend ?
Dix pour cent.
Dix pour cent pour moi, et je dis rien.
Tu dis rien parce que ta mère
est la soeur de la mienne.
- C'est pour ça que tu dis rien, Bernard.
- On va même pas utiliser ton vrai nom.
On va enregistrer Fuzzy Dunlop,
un nom de guerre.
Fuzzy Dunlop ? Dix pour cent.
Génial, à présent, je dois traiter
avec toute la famille.
Jour de paye, Zig. Encore un tour.
Tout ça, hein ?
Ouais, ça dépote, là-bas.
J'ai même pas le temps de le dépenser.
Jolie voiture que t'as là.
Ouais, à zéro pour cent d'intérêt.
Pas cher, le fric.
"Pas cher, le fric" ?
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire, putain ?
Ça veut dire que j'ai un bon plan, patate.
Tu devrais songer à rouler à neuf toi aussi.
Ouais, je vais y songer.
Si tu veux avoir une caisse,
il te faut de l'oseille.
Occupe-toi de tes affaires.
Tu t'es frité avec Maui.
- Il avait besoin d'une leçon.
- T'es un mauvais coucheur, maintenant ?
- Oui, c'est moi.
- Salut, Niko, tout va bien ?
- Tout se passe bien.
- S'il t'en faut plus, parles-en à Sergei.
Ouais, je passerai vous voir
plus tard, d'accord ?
- D'accord.
- C'est lui ?
- T'as pas à t'occuper de ça...
- Je veux le voir.
Laisse-moi traiter les affaires.
T'as vu, tu es payé, non ?
Va te faire foutre !
Je vais arranger mes coups tout seul.
- Prends l'argent, Zig.
- Tu m'en crois pas capable ?
Mais ramasse cet argent.
- J'en veux pas, t'as qu'à le prendre.
- Non, toi.
Et merde ! Voilà !
ENTREPÔT - PYRAMID - Appel reçu
C'est au sujet des fauteuils
que j'ai commandés. Ils ne sont pas arrivés.
- Vous en avez commandé combien ?
- Bien, trois.
PORTABLE DE TRUCKER - Appel reçu
Ils sont arrivés.
- Oui ?
- Salut, c'est Nick.
Comment ça va ?
Ça va, je suis prêt à discuter pour plus.
Tu me dis où et combien.
Je te rappelle.
- Moins prudents que les gars de Barksdale.
- On n'est pas à l'ouest de Baltimore.
Ils se servent de leurs téléphones parce
qu'ils s'attendent pas à ce qu'on les écoute.
Abrégeons cette conversation,
voulez-vous ? Jamais de la vie.
McNulty est un gars accrocheur.
C'est très utile, quelqu'un comme lui.
N'importe quoi serait aussi utile.
Il n'en est pas question.
Vous avez déjà vu un chien
qui a senti un os enterré dans le jardin ?
Ouais. Et j'en ai déjà vu un chier
sur mon tapis, aussi.
Arrêtez ces conneries. Vous croyez quoi ?
Il a aussi le feu dans le pantalon, ce mec.
La réponse est non.
Tout ce que je veux de vous, je l'obtiens.
- Sans boniments. Sans discussion.
- Quoi ?
En acceptant ces meurtres, mes conditions
ont été claires. Vous vous souvenez ?
J'ai besoin de McNulty sur cette enquête.
Lieutenant, quand j'ai dit : "N'importe quoi",
je pensais à vous laisser m'embrasser.
Me tripoter les nénés ou un truc
dans ce genre là. Mais pas à ça.
Vous voulez que j'identifie les corps ?
Je compte sur vous.
Qui c'est ?
Ça peut être des mecs de CBS
qui sont montés du Sud
ou l'équipe de Tavon
de l'autre côté d'Edmondson.
Si loin que ça ?
Y a un truc bien sûr.
- Quoi ?
- Ils ont de quoi servir nos clients.
- Diggins, police maritime.
- Je cherche McNulty.
- McNulty, c'est pour toi.
- Ouais ?
Merci, lieutenant.
Dunlop, Fuzzy -

La jeune génération pour les noms, c'est...
AVANCE : 150 $
Cent cinquante ? Je rêve !
Il nous a rencardés sur le fils Sobotka.
Voilà l'autre volet de l'affaire.
Trois appartements au sixième étage,
tous les trois loués par Pyramid SA.
Ceux qui possèdent l'entrepôt de la drogue.
On peut penser que les filles
y sont logées ? Ou plus ?
Non, l'immeuble est trop bien
pour être une pension.
Un immeuble de cette classe,
c'est pour les trouillards.
- Ils s'y sentent à l'abri.
- Ils entrent comment ? Par le vestibule ?
- Par le garage, sans doute.
- Soit ils ont une carte de parking,
soit ils sont hébergés
par quelqu'un qui en a une.
C'est l'élément manquant.
Si ceux qui contrôlent les filles
ont un lien avec ceux
qui contrôlent la drogue,
vous pouvez faire fermer le bordel et ensuite,
écouter les réactions au téléphone.
Relancer l'intérêt des écoutes.
Exactement.
PROPRIÉTÉ PRIVÉE - INTERDIT D'ENTRER
Les croisières enchanteresses,
les filles aux seins nus.
Moi, je te le dis, cette fois, le vent a tourné.
Y faut que j'y aille, Diggy.
Merci.
- On a pas été payés depuis hier.
- Elle était pareille, la veille.
Tiens ! Yo. On est remplacés ou quoi ?
Ouais, on est saqués et on y est pour rien.
Ce qu'on vend nous, est pas à la hauteur
de ce qu'ils ont, c'est tout.
Ça craint, mec. On est presque à sec,
on va se faire virer, c'est nul.
Les mecs, j'ai rien pour vous, yo.
On peut pas continuer comme ça.
Écoute, je comprends,
mais vous allez encore repartir comme ça.
Peut-être qu'on pourrait avoir une allocation
de séparation par exemple, tu vois ?
Tu ferais mieux de rentrer chez toi avant que
je perde mon sang-froid avec tes conneries.
Ces copains nazes.
Une allocation de conneries.
Vous allez voir, avec vos conneries. Eh, toi !
La première hypothèse,
c'est que les gens qui contrôlent les filles
et ceux qui contrôlent la drogue
sont de la même bande.
La deuxième hypothèse,
c'est que les appartements
servent de bordels pour les filles russes.
Il faut donc y infiltrer quelqu'un
pour en avoir la preuve.
Je pense qu'à ce stade,
il faut se montrer subtils.
Pour vous, lieutenant, j'irais en enfer.
Vous le savez.
On dirait pas qu'il devrait payer.
- Désolée, non. Des impératifs domestiques.
- Pareil pour moi.
Nadine me les mettrait
dans un bocal sur sa table de nuit
si elle l'apprenait.
Quoi ?
Qui se ressemble s'assemble.
Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait, putain ?
Sers-moi une double pinte, Dolores.
Regarde un peu ça, mon vieux.
Mon Dieu, Seigneur, regardez ça.
Dolo, Dolores, c'est bien toi ?
Dolores, je voudrais te présenter
mon avocat. Voici Steven Miles.
Alors, je verrai peut-être pas très clair
dans vos conneries,
mais lui verra. Donc si vous permettez,
j'aimerais un truc bien raide pour moi
et un pour mon avocat.
- Dites-moi que je rêve !
- Non, ce serait pas sérieux.
C'est des vrais diamants
qu'il a autour du cou ?
Non mais t'es malade !
T'es vraiment dingue !
Pourquoi ? Je suis le seul gars
au Sud de Baltimore
qui ai jamais tenté de gagner l'affection
d'un animal de basse-cour ?
Il est bourré ou quoi ?
On se tait. Bon, chut, chut.
Un petit dernier pour la route. Et n'oublie
pas de servir mon sympathique ami à plumes.
Pour ce qui est du canard,
la prochaine est pour moi.
Là, doucement.
Y va nous falloir une soucoupe,
mets-lui un peu de bière dedans.
Il lui faut un fortifiant.
Et mets-la sur mon compte, Dolores.
Prends ton temps. À la santé des canards.
Ce soir, tu bois un canon avec les dockers.
D'après toi, ça correspond ?
C'est la voiture qui transportait
les filles et c'est le même conducteur.
Et pour le passager ?
Il a la tête de l'emploi.
Un porte containers sur le quai Talco
au nom de Caspia décharge demain matin.
Et il y a Horseface ?
Je vais appeler le lieutenant
pour lui dire qu'il faut qu'on se tienne prêts.
Cette fois au moins, on a installé
nos écoutes. On entend et on voit.
La navette s'en va.
Qu'est-ce qu'il attend ?
Il rassemble son courage
pour raconter des histoires.
Mentir à sa femme, c'est facile.
Regarder ses enfants dans les yeux,
c'est plus dur.
Police !
Votre permis.
"Robert Johnson." T'y crois, toi ?
Bon, vous me décevez beaucoup.
Vous voulez rentrer chez vous, Bob ?
Si un garçon solitaire veut rencontrer
une jolie fille dans cette ville.
Comment il s'y prendrait ?
Il appellerait ce numéro.
Il fait ce numéro. Ensuite ?
Il compose les quatre chiffres dans le coin.
CONNECTIONS - 410-333-3780 - 2656
- Et ?
- Il demande Eve.
- Quoi ?
- Il demande Eve.
Allez, rentrez chez vous.
Rentrez bien, Bob.
- Johnson.
- Mon invitation au bal.
Ça y est. On en a un.
Douze quatorze. Kima.
Un conteneur a disparu
en un clic du châssis.
Affirmatif. Je le surveille jusqu'au portail.
- Préviens les garçons.
- D'accord.
- Kima est censée faire quoi ?
- Gaz et électricité.
PORTABLE DE TRUCKER - Appel
- Oui ?
- Tout va bien.
- Tu rentres tout de suite ?
- Oui.
ENTREPÔT - PYRAMID - Appel reçu
Camion blanc se dirige vers vous,
transporte un conteneur rouge.
Numéro d'identification :
X-W-B, comme Bernard,
C, quinze, soixante dix-sept, vingt-six, huit.
- Chauffeur : homme blanc, cheveux bruns.
- Bien reçu.
Je disparais dès qu'il aura franchi le portail.
La camionnette est trop reconnaissable.
Bien reçu, on est prêts.
- Des plombs arrachés ?
- Salut, Frank.
Qu'est-ce qui manque ?
À première vue, il n'y a rien qui manque.
Un conteneur de couches.
- De couches ?
- Jetables, oui.
Je pense que même ton équipe n'irait pas
jusqu'à voler des Pampers sur un quai.
Pas si sûr.
Les plombs ont sûrement été arrachés
au déchargement, c'est tout.
Et Bea Russell revient quand
du terminal de Fairfield ?
Qui, Beadie ? Elle est pas à Fairfield.
T'en fais pas Frank,
ta copine va bientôt revenir.
- Ouais ?
- Elle est détachée.
Auprès de la police urbaine, je crois.
TERMINAL DE CARGAISONS DE PATAPSCO
C'est parti !
Terminé pour moi. À vous le contact visuel.
Douze zéro huit. Bien reçu.
Il y a un truc avec ma facture de téléphone.
Maintenant c'est Bea Russell
qui fricote avec la vraie police.
T'es paranoïaque, Frank.
- Pourquoi elle mentirait ?
- Est-ce que je sais, bon dieu ?
- Le Grec en a deux aujourd'hui ?
- Boris revient dans une heure.
Le deuxième conteneur est dans une travée
plus bas, prêt à partir dès que j'y vais.
Enregistre ce conteneur directement.
T'entends ?
Entre-le dans l'ordinateur avec les autres.
Et le conteneur suivant,
celui-là, tu le fais disparaître.
Tu veux perdre une caisse ordinaire ?
- Et la donner aux Russes, ouais.
- Tu vas leur dire ?
Si je suis dingue, ça se calmera demain
et on fera sortir le bon.
Mais si j'ai raison, ils vont me dire merci.
Assure-toi qu'il n'y a personne dans le conteneur
quand tu vas le ranger.
Je sais.
Il se passe quelque chose.
Un autre conteneur disparu
est prêt pour l'enlèvement.
Ils les évacuent en tandem.
- Ça veut dire deux par deux, Jimmy.
- Je sais ce que ça veut dire.
- Douze zéro huit.
- Douze zéro huit.
Carver, où se trouve votre camion ?
Il a livré le conteneur à l'entrepôt
et il est sorti.
- On suit le camion ou le conteneur ?
- Le conteneur.
Bien reçu.
PYRAMID SA.
- J'ai personne sur le port.
- Kima ?
- Non, elle est partie.
- J'y vais.
Non, le camion est déjà reparti.
Vous allez le manquer.
J'appelle la police du port,
qu'ils retardent le camion.
Oui. Vous pensez qu'il est encore là ?
Bonne chance.
Carte grise et permis, s'il vous plaît. Vous
rouliez à quarante dans une zone à trente.
- Vous arrêtez à quarante ?
- Carte grise et permis de conduire.
Bureau des containers - Patapsco - Appel
Bon sang, si on était branchés
sur la ligne de l'administration du port.
Je voulais juste vous donner une astuce.
Le dernier article qu'on vous a livré
est une erreur.
J'étais au courant,
et pourtant, j'ai laissé faire.
Pas au téléphone, Frank.
D'accord. Mais cette fois,
il faut qu'il soit présent.
Il voudra venir pour entendre
ce que j'ai à dire.
Allez-y, ouvrez-le.
TRINGLES À RIDEAUX EN PLASTIQUE
Poupées Bobbie
Des poupées Bobbie.
Qu'est-ce que c'est
que ces conneries, hein ?
Moi, j'attends de la vodka russe,
et tu m'apportes de la merde de Taiwan.
Donne-moi ton téléphone.
Enculés de Polacks.
C'est des cons ou c'est des voleurs ?
Appel - 4109590875
- Il compose le même numéro.
- Legeteh.
C'est arrivé. Mais c'en est pas.
C'est des merdes.
J'avais prévu ça. T'as qu'à t'en débarrasser.
Mais m'en débarrasser, où ça ?
Tu les balances dans la rue.
- Ça, c'est génial.
- C'est lui qui commande.
Et on l'a repéré.
- 7 h du matin ?
- Putain, qu'est-ce que tu crois ?
Y faut qu'on soit en place
quand ils vont arriver.
Yo, c'est tôt, merde.
Yo, vous êtes d'accord ?
Sinon je vais trouver des mecs qui savent
se servir d'une batte de baseball.
C'est pas la peine de parler de batte.
C'est d'accord.
J'en parle si je veux, putain.
Et amenez vos gars, hein ? À sept heures.
- Ouais.
- Salut.
Laisse tomber. Allez, viens.
Ça alors, t'es un accro de la chatte,
toi, putain.
On peut pas regarder les femmes, nous ?
Ouais, mais on devient
complètement con avec ça.
- Ouais, au moins, je m'en tape une.
- Moi aussi, je m'en tape une.
Mais il n'y a pas que ça dans la vie.
Lieutenant, vous êtes toujours là ?
Je suis là.
Je surveille toujours le deuxième conteneur,
mais c'est bizarre.
Il a atterri dans un bazar du quartier Est.
Il le dépose là.
Bien reçu. Rentrez.
- Vous voulez pas filer le conteneur ?
- Négatif. Le conteneur est normal.
Je sais pas, oncle Frank.
On additionne deux et deux
et il arrive que ça fasse six.
Peut-être.
T'as appelé Spiros, au moins ?
Spiros saura quoi faire.
Viens pas trop tard demain,
je voudrais qu'avant, on ait le temps de dîner.
D'accord.
Je tiens pas la distance avec toi.
Il est à qui, le canard ?
Ziggy.
Daniels est là ?
- Non.
- Où on en est avec le deuxième conteneur ?
Pas de contrebande.
On les a entendus se plaindre au téléphone.
Il y en a un qui a merdé son coup.
Et pour tout dire, ils ont même appelé
le patron pour en parler.
C'est un grand jour. Si on allait fêter ça ?
Nan. Je suis parti à la chasse à la paperasse.
Je dois libérer la baby-sitter. Mais si vous
me ramenez, j'accepterai une bière.
- Pas plus, après je m'endors.
- Ouais, moi aussi.
- Vous n'avez pas de voiture ?
- Elle n'a plus de plaquettes de freins.
Mais oui. Deux. Des garçons.
Et toi, alors ?
Une fille et un garçon.
Et ton mari...
Je sais que c'est pas mes affaires,
mais il est mort ?
Tu veux dire que personne ne quitterait
une beauté comme moi sauf un cadavre ?
Je disais ça comme ça.
Il m'a quittée.
Nous a quittés.
Il a pris ses affaires
et il est parti dans le Sud.
Il m'a dit que c'était mon métier ou lui.
Que je négligeais mon foyer,
enfin, ce genre de choses.
Et qu'il ne s'était pas marié
pour préparer lui-même son dîner.
Résultat : il le prépare lui-même.
Qu'est-ce qui clochait avec votre femme ?
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Elle est morte.
- Non, ça va, Gus. Ça suffit.
- C'est toi qui vois, Jimmy.
Bon, on peut y aller ?
- Oui.
- Je reviens, j'ai un coup de fil à donner.
Vous pouvez composer votre code.
- Bonsoir, que puis-je pour vous ?
- Je voudrais parler à Eve.
- Je suis Eve.
- Je voudrais vous contacter.
Vous voulez un rendez-vous ce soir ?
Pas ce soir, non.
Je repasse par ici dans deux jours.
- Vous connaissez déjà nos prestations ?
- Non, c'est la première fois.
On vous propose tout ce qui vous plaira,
quand il vous plaira.
Quel genre de filles recherchez-vous ?
Nous avons un grand choix. Ce sera à vous
de choisir quand vous viendrez.
Quand pensez-vous venir ?
- J'en ai pour une minute.
- Trouve le mot juste.
Arrête ! Éloigne-toi de la boite à gâteaux.
Longue journée.
Oui. Moi aussi.
Merci pour la bière.
Au revoir.
Yo, les voilà, les voilà !
Ces enculés croient
qu'ils nous impressionnent.
Le négro, t'es devenu complètement barje.
- T'es installé sur mon territoire.
- C'est le mien, maintenant.
- Je te l'ai piqué pendant que tu dormais.
- Vous arrivez trop tard.
Bon écoute, je vous laisse dégager
gentiment, ou bien ça se passe autrement.
Avec qui tu veux faire autrement ? Eux ?
- Je vais être ton pire cauchemar, toi !
- Je sais, je sais.
Ouais. C'est ça, avance, connard.
Ils vont revenir.
Ouais, vu comment on les a jetés,
ils ont intérêt.
- Où est-il ?
- Tu peux me parler à moi.
- Ça t'a dépassé, cette fois.
- Je lui dirai ce que tu as dit.
Foutaises ! Viens, Nick.
C'est lui, le Grec ?
Ce vieux-là, je l'ai déjà vu ici.
Asseyez-vous.
Ça fait longtemps qu'on n'avait pas parlé,
hein, Frank ?
- Café, autre chose ?
- Ça va.
Qu'est-ce qui t'embête ?
À vrai dire, tout m'embête.
D'abord, je pense que mon portable
est sur écoute.
D'un seul coup, ils se fichent pas mal
que je ne paie pas mes factures.
En même temps, j'apprends
que la flic qui a découvert tes filles
a été mutée pour enquêter
sur un truc avec la police judiciaire.
- Et tu as interverti les caisses.
- J'ai fait un test.
Je t'en ai donné un normal
et j'ai entreposé le tien.
Aussitôt le flic de la police du port
a arrêté le camion du Russe
juste après le chargement.
Je crois que notre ordinateur a été piraté.
Très malin.
Dès que tu as appelé, j'ai fermé l'entrepôt.
Oui, c'est très bien, mais maintenant,
il va falloir rouvrir l'entrepôt.
Sortez encore quelques conteneurs
normaux, livrez-les au même entrepôt.
Si on vous surveille,
montrez qu'on n'a rien à cacher.
On touche toujours la même part ?
Tu veux rire ?
Ton nom ?
- Nick.
- Sobotka.
Bien, c'est une bonne question, Nico.
Mais il faut que ce soit pour tout le monde
pareil. Pas de boulot, pas d'argent.
Peu importe ce qu'il y a dans
les conteneurs, il faut qu'on les contrôle.
- C'est du boulot, non ?
- On a une part des emmerdes et vous aussi.
- Vous ne comprenez pas...
- Je comprends parfaitement,
on fait pas ça pour le plaisir.
Il n'y a pas que l'argent.
Il y a aussi des choses qui se passent
maintenant dans mon syndicat. Tout de suite.
Pas dans un mois, quand la session
sera de l'histoire ancienne. Tout de suite !
Entendu. On paie quand même.
Je pense à toutes les affaires
que nous ferons dans le futur.
Et je voudrais que tu sois content.
Merci.
Le monde a changé, Frank.
Tu devrais sortir dépenser un peu d'argent
dans quelque chose que tu peux toucher,
une nouvelle voiture, un nouveau manteau.
C'est pour ça qu'on se lève le matin, non ?
On a du WMD. T'en veux ?
Non, je voudrais ce que vous aviez l'autre jour.
- Ben c'est ēa que j'ai.
- L'autre, t'appelais ēa du Ben Laden.
Maintenant on dit WMD.
Et ēa va te pilonner grave les neurones.
C'est une arnaque ou quoi ?
C'est la mźme merde,
il n'y a que le nom qui change.
Tu seras content.
Allez, va t'habiller.
Je t'ai sorti des habits que j'ai posés lą-haut.
Et ton sac, tu l'oublies pas, t'entends ?
T'as ton chrome, petit ?
Vas-y, passe-moi le mien.
Faites bien gaffe aux tirs croisés, pigé ?
On y va.
Ils arrivent par l'allée !
Ils reviennent !
Vise le torse.
Écarte-toi de lą.
Tu te couches sur le sol
et tu bouges plus, t'entends ?
- Dis, tu m'entends ?
- D'accord, maman.
Venez !
Oh, merde !
Merde !
- Qu'est-ce que t'as ą courir ?
- Ēa va pas, non ?
Et merde !
Faut coincer cette salope !
Les salauds !
Sors de ton trou !
Chéri, la bagarre est terminée.
Alors prends ton sac et va ą l'école.
Allez on repart !
Oh, T.T., tu m'entends ? Dépźche-toi !
C'est bon, ēa tire plus.
Tu finis vite de te préparer
et tu files ą l'école.
Je veux que tu ailles...
Non !
SUR ÉCOUTE
"Le monde est plus petit, de nos jours."
- Le Grec
Ils changent de code ?
J'appelle pour mes fauteuils relax.
Vous devez en avoir cinq pour moi.
- La cargaison arrive demain.
- Compris.
Voilą ce qu'on entendait ą l'entrepōt
de Newkirk il y a quelques jours.
Ils parlaient dope de faēon directe.
Pas de blabla, pas de chichi.
Écoutez-les maintenant.
Pyramid Incorporated, puis-je vous aider ?
- Ouais, vous avez des dos ą dos ou non ?
- Nous ne faisons plus cette ligne.
Kima, Carver, Herc et moi,
on s'est relayé pour surveiller l'entrepōt
sans interruption
depuis qu'on a suivi le camion.
On a vu aucun de nos lascars.
Aucune trace de trafic lié ą la drogue.
Et pour couronner le tout, Sobotka
ne se sert plus de son téléphone cellulaire.
- On s'est fait repérer quelque part.
- Le deuxičme conteneur.
Que la police portuaire arrźte leur camion
leur a sūrement foutu la trouille.
Si c'est bien ēa,
on s'est trahis ą cause d'une connerie.
Ils s'en sont débarrassés
comme si c'était une erreur de livraison.
- Quoi ?
- Ēa aussi, ils ont dū le changer.
S'ils se doutaient qu'on les avait ą l'oeil,
ils ont dū échanger eux-mźmes
le conteneur, par sécurité.
Et leur camion a quitté les docks
chargé d'autre chose
- pour voir si on les arrźtait.
- Ce qu'on a fait.
Ce que j'ai fait.
Non, ils se méfient de nous qu'ą moitié.
S'ils savaient vraiment qu'on est lą,
ils fermeraient l'entrepōt et ils se tireraient.
Au lieu de ēa, ils restent lą-bas,
ils détournent les coups de téléphone
et ils nous attendent.
Je suis trčs patient et je vais pas les lācher.
Hé, gāche pas la pelloche.
Ēa fait si longtemps qu'on est scotché lą,
que j'en arrive ą te trouver beau.
Ēa bouge ?
Si la drogue entre, elle doit bien ressortir.
Alors c'est quoi ce bordel ?
En retard.
Avant, quand un gamin de neuf ans
se prenait un plomb,
le chef de district
arrivait en quelques minutes.
On vit dans le Meilleur des Mondes.
J'étais ą Washington avec Burrell
quand j'ai été averti.
Washington DC ? Vous y faisiez quoi ?
J'ai accompagné Burrell
avec un autre chef de district au D.O.J.
On s'est vendu,
histoire d'avoir une petite rallonge.
Alors, qu'est-ce qu'on a ?
Un enfant de neuf ans dans sa chambre.
Il s'est pris une balle perdue
ą travers la fenźtre.
- Mort ?
- Déclaré mort ą l'hōpital.
- Des témoins ?
- Personne ne donne de noms,
mais apparemment, c'était deux bandes
qui se disputaient un territoire.
On a retrouvé les douilles
de trois calibres différents.
Nous, on va quadriller dur,
mais vos équipes devraient écumer
les points de deals du quartier
et embarquer les mecs.
Ēa servira ą rien.
Si on coince suffisamment
de ces merdeux, l'affaire sera jugée.
Je ne parle pas de ēa, je connais la procédure.
Je parle de tout ce bordel.
Ils font voyager leur merde d'un coin de rue
ą l'autre comme si c'était un plan.
Envoyez vos gars,
qu'ils les secouent un peu.
Ēa vous fera du bien.
Tu as parlé de marketing
et de changement de nom et tout ēa.
- Tu as dit que si...
- Je t'ai dit de changer le nom du produit,
je t'ai pas dit de tuer des gens.
On a changé le nom
de cette dope merdique si souvent
qu'il n'y a plus personne
qui vient dans les tours.
Alors que pour les gars de Carrollton,
ēa marche bien.
Qui a tué l'enfant ?
J'en sais rien, je crois pas que ce soit nous.
Mais les autres, les salauds,
ils y sont allés fort...
Tu te doutes que les flics, ils vont faire
tomber des mecs au nom de ce gosse.
Ils sont obligés.
Ēa veut dire qu'on doit tout arrźter
en attendant que ēa se calme.
Ēa veut dire que dans les tours,
que dans tout le quartier,
tout sera mort, tout sera hors service
un sacré bout de temps.
Je sais, String.
Je suis désolé, mec.
Je vais te dire un truc.
Le jeu que tu joues lą,
il va plus loin que ta réputation ą tenir,
que ton coin de rue ą garder.
Il faut que tu sois féroce et tu le sais.
Mais en plus de ēa,
faut aussi que tu sois malin.
Faut donner et prendre des deux cōtés.
- T'as pigé ?
- Ouais.
Alors, tous les flingues qui ont tiré
une balle au coin de cette rue,
je veux les voir disparaītre, t'entends ?
Et ēa suffira pas de les jeter
dans un caniveau.
Tu vas téléphoner ą Shamrock et vous allez
me balancer tout cet attirail dans le port.
D'accord.
Hé, on y arrive.
Il y a des gens qui attendent que je les livre.
Et Sergei dit que tant qu'on sait pas
pour la police...
On a décidé d'arrźter le business
pendant quelques jours.
Ton oncle, il a raison d'źtre prudent.
Mais Niko,
si tu veux faire ce genre d'affaires,
tu devrais pas en discuter avec nous.
Pourquoi ?
On est plus ce que t'appellerais
des grossistes.
Et moi je suis un gagne-petit, pas vrai ?
Tu n'es pas trčs gros
mais t'es avec des amis.
Appelle ce numéro.
- Discute avec lui.
- Mike ?
White Mike ?
- Tu le connais ?
- De Curtis Bay.
Ouais, j'étais au lycée avec ce gars.
Maintenant tu es avec nous, alors
il sera correct avec toi. Pas de problčme.
La suite de notre business.
On va faire disparaītre ces conteneurs.
Ils sont tous cleans.
Envoie-les ą Newkirk Street.
S'il y a un problčme,
ils stopperont les camions,
ou on verra la police.
S'il se passe rien, terminé les soucis.
Entendu.
On n'a plus le téléphone de l'entrepōt ?
J'ai passé la journée d'hier
ą donner le nouveau numéro ą nos hommes.
Pour moi, ce sont des conneries.
Si vraiment ils avaient eu un doute
sur le camion, ils l'auraient fouillé, non ?
Les flics !
Vous allez oł ? Vous connaissez le principe.
Je vous veux tous contre le mur.
Magnez-vous !
Allez les mecs, venez par lą !
Contre le mur !
Toi, tu déconnes, mec !
Je suis clean, j'ai rien fait, merde !
Vous pourrez tous vous expliquer au poste.
Lą-bas, on écoutera vos salades.
- On bouge pas et on dit rien.
- C'est pas juste, moi je suis clean, tu piges ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais dans le puits, alors ?
- Ben je dis non ą la drogue.
Dis pas juste non ą la drogue, connard.
Dis : "Non merci."
Allez, baisse la tźte ! Dépźche-toi ! Monte !
Allez, laisse-toi faire et grimpe lą-dedans.
Pousse-toi un peu, trou du cul.
C'est honteux qu'il ait fallu qu'un gamin
meure pour qu'on fasse enfin ēa.
Et c'est quoi,
ce qu'on est en train de faire au juste ?
CHEZ JOHN RADIO ET TÉLÉVISION
Le petit gars a été tué ą cause de conneries.
Et résultat, maintenant t'as la police
qui te colle au cul.
Vaut mieux źtre cōté Est aujourd'hui,
mon frčre.
C'est vrai que ēa se serait pas passé
comme ēa si j'avais accepté ton offre.
J'aurais pu vendre tout ce que j'aurais voulu.
Mes mecs se seraient pas battus.
Ils se seraient pas battus et ils auraient pas
été sur le coin de rue de quelqu'un d'autre.
T'es de l'Ouest.
T'as dū entendre parler
de Charlie Sollers, non ?
Non.
C'était quand ēa bougeait
ą Franklin et Fremont.
Ēa remonte carrément
aux années soixante, tu vois.
- Sollers ?
- Il vendait l'héro comme si c'était de l'eau.
Et le salaud,
je peux te dire qu'il s'est fait du fric.
Je vois mais alors pas du tout de qui tu parles.
Je sais que tu le connais pas.
Et la police non plus.
Et les petits braqueurs non plus
savent que dalle sur lui.
Charlie Sollers, il faisait que vendre sa dope.
Pas de grand jeu, pas de vendeurs de rue.
Il achetait ą un dollar et il revendait ą deux.
Quand t'es vraiment poussé dos au mur,
des fois, tu sors le flingue.
Je sais, ēa m'est arrivé.
Mais on gagne pas sa vie comme ēa.
Avon est un soldat.
C'est avec lui qui faut źtre
quand il y a des emmerdes.
Mais question business...
- T'as toujours ta connexion ?
- Direct du bateau, String.
D'accord.
Je te la prends ą toi, au prix que tu la payes.
Et je te laisse distribuer
cette merde dans les tours.
Je te laisse la 734, la 770 et la 221.
Je me garde les trois autres.
Comment tu vas le dire ą Avon ?
C'est plutōt logique, non ?
Et il devrait l'accepter puisque c'est logique.
Non ?
Non, sans déconner.
CUISINE AU FEU DE BOIS
BIENS EMBALLES
- Je croyais que t'étais avec Nicky.
- Je l'emmerde, Nick.
T'étais comme son autre moitié avant.
Je veux pas de son putain de fric.
C'est de l'argent de la drogue.
Cette foutue drogue, c'est le mal, non ?
C'est vrai, regarde ce que cette saleté
fait ą la communauté.
T'as magouillé toute l'année
avec White Mike.
Hé, on peut changer des fois.
En plus, j'ai imaginé un plan
qui va ridiculiser ces conneries en beauté,
je peux te l'assurer.
T'es intéressé ?
- Je fais quoi ?
- Ce qu'un docker sait faire le mieux, John.
Hé, Zig ! Ton canard,
ēa l'intéresse pas le whisky, lą ?
Non, il boit que de la bičre. Les whiskys
au nom d'oiseau en plus, il déteste.
Je serais prźt ą donner ma jambe droite
pour un whisky et une bičre.
New Charles est lą !
- Tu te bouges bien.
- Et bientōt j'aurai une prothčse, tu sais.
T'as un avocat efficace ?
Nat Coxson m'en a trouvé un via le syndicat.
Il trinque avec nous, le canard ?
- Il va falloir que tu changes ton nom.
- Et pourquoi ?
New Charles, il travaillera plus
pour un salaire de cul de jatte.
"Beau Moignon", peut-źtre ?
Oh, j'ai une idée. "Le Pied."
"Le Cloche-Pied."
- Si on t'appelait "Tic-Toc" ?
- Tic-Toc ?
Ēa sonne bien, ouais.
Tic-Toc. Ēa me plaīt.
Je vous ai téléphoné il y a deux jours.
Je disais que je serais en ville ce soir.
- C'est ta premičre fois ?
- Oui. Une grande premičre.
Tu travailles dans quoi, Jimmy ?
Tu es de la police ?
- Tu travailles pour la police ?
- Non ! Rien ą voir !
Non, je suis représentant commercial.
Je fais des tournées. Voyez ?
- Tu habites oł ?
- Je vais pas vous le dire, ēa.
Je vis pas en ville.
Je regrette.
Je crois qu'on ne pourra pas t'aider ce soir.
Merci.
T'es trop nul ! T'es vraiment nul.
Merde, je savais pas
qu'il y avait un interrogatoire !
Je suis qu'un type
qui se cherche une fille, non ?
Salut, le barjo.
Ēa va pas, qu'est-ce qui t'arrive ?
Oh, putain ! Ziggy !
Zig, qu'est-ce que t'as ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il a, mon cousin ?
Je veux plus entendre parler de ce trou du cul.
- Il s'est saoulé la gueule ą en crever.
- Pitoyable, ouais.
Faut źtre un crétin fini
pour donner du whisky ą un canard, non ?
Ce gamin est cinglé !
Et il tenait pas l'alcool, son putain d'oiseau.
Des fauteuils relax ?
Oui, et des dos ą dos.
Deux sortes différentes.
Héro et coke.
- C'est quoi un dos ą dos ?
- C'est une sorte de causeuse, un divan.
- Et les quantités ?
- Toutes en nombres ronds.
- Pas de quart, de tiers ou de demie.
- Ce sont des grammes ?
Quel nombre de fauteuils
ils demandent en général ?
Ils dépassent rarement les cinq.
Proposition Joe est sur Ashland
tout le long jusqu'ą North.
Ēa lui fait dix coins de rue facile.
Ces chiffres collent pas du tout.
Ce sont des kilos. C'est la filičre principale.
- Qu'est-ce qui est rentré et sorti hier soir ?
- Pas grand-chose.
Aucun camion,
quelques bagnoles qui sont venues,
mais aucun des dealers
qu'on connaīt déją ne s'est montré.
La cargaison du dernier camion
a dū ressortir dans des coffres de voitures.
Pour l'instant, ils doivent faire
leur distribution depuis un autre endroit.
D'abord, il faut se rebrancher
sur le bon téléphone.
Le motif de suspicion
qui vous a conduits au téléphone
de l'entrepōt vous conduira oł vous voulez.
Tout ce qu'il faut, c'est le nouveau numéro.
Des nouvelles lignes ont été installées ?
Les agents de la compagnie disent que non.
Ils utilisent un portable, alors.
On peut obtenir le numéro
par le portable du Russe.
C'est d'accord.
Freamon et Prez, vous passerez
votre prochain service sur les écoutes.
Bunk et Russell vous relayeront.
Herc et Carver,
vous surveillerez Newkirk Street
pour voir si le trafic reprend.
McNulty et Greggs
infiltrent le cercle de prostitution.
Mais jusque-lą, ceux qui gčrent les filles
se sont montrés prudents
avec les nouveaux.
Il nous faudrait une autre accroche
de ce cōté-lą.
Des questions ?
Pour les filles,
c'était quoi votre couverture ?
Le représentant qui vit pas en ville.
- Le type qui vient de loin ?
- Comment ēa ?
Plus tu viendras de loin, plus ils te croiront
et moins t'auras l'air d'un flic.
Tu sais prendre un accent ?
Anglais, britannique, écossais, je sais pas.
Facile.
J'avais envie de me faire
des petites gāteries,
et comme je cherchais une adresse,
ce type m'a dit de téléphoner ą ce numéro.
Entraīne-toi.
Deux cent mille ?
C'est pas le quart de ce qu'ils doivent.
Ils disent qu'ils payeront encore deux cents
quand leur chargement quittera les docks.
- Et ensuite ?
- C'est tout.
Ces Colombiens,
ils n'ont aucun honneur, Spiros.
Ce sont des tricheurs.
- Les produits chimiques, ēa va, non ?
- Aucune réclamation.
Ils disent mźme qu'ils en veulent plus.
Et ils ont compris qu'on leur garantit
que leur produit passera la douane ?
Bien.
- Et ils essaient encore de grappiller.
- Pourquoi ?
Qu'est-ce qu'ils croient ?
C'est tout bénef pour nous.
On va accepter d'źtre payés
moitié moins que prévu,
parce que quatre cent mille dollars,
c'est encore un gros paquet.
Le Grec ne sera pas content.
C'est le business, Eton.
Le Grec saura źtre malin.
Nom de Dieu.
Tu tires accidentellement
sur un enfant de neuf ans
et c'est toute la ville qui pčte les plombs.
L'erreur est humaine, faut s'en souvenir.
Le maire était sur les lieux hier soir.
Il a dit que ce crime serait sanctionné.
Va dire au maire qu'on travaille
toujours sans témoin oculaire.
Les gens de la rue ?
On m'a parlé d'un jeune de dix-sept ans
dont le nom de guerre est Bodie.
Les Stups l'ont sous le nom
de Preston Broadus.
Pourquoi, puis-je savoir,
Preston n'a pas encore été gentiment jeté
dans l'une de nos salles d'interrogatoire ?
Nos voitures sont déją chez sa grand-mčre
ą l'instant oł on parle.
Ą qui tu crois t'adresser, lą ?
Des amateurs ?
Je me fous de Nick. Ēa, c'est mon coup.
Si ēa t'intéresse, tu traites avec moi.
Voilą, j'ai des classes S et des classes SL.
Roadsters, berlines, cabriolets.
Elles sont toutes neuves
avec les clefs au volant.
Elles ont pas été forcées.
- Tombées du cargo ?
- Tombées du cargo, sans déconner !
Tu m'as vu ?
Tu me prends pour un concessionnaire ?
Je te fais vingt cents le dollar.
Mais pour conclure l'affaire, il faudra
que t'achčtes un minimum de trois voitures,
sinon ēa vaut pas le coup pour moi.
Le prix de base d'une S. 430
c'est environ 73 000 $.
T'arrondis, et je te fais ą quinze,
pour chaque bagnole que tu demandes.
Une voiture volée,
c'est une voiture volée, non ?
Sans certificat, personne n'en voudra,
mźme ą dix !
Oui, ą Baltimore, peut-źtre.
Je parie que t'as de la famille qui s'en branle
de savoir que la bagnole
ait un certificat ou non.
Merde, ce serait vraiment
que les affaires vont trčs mal
si un entrepreneur international comme toi
ne savait pas quoi faire avec une ou deux
berlines de luxe supplémentaires.
C'est le grand jour pour Jimmy McNulty.
Ou devrais-je dire James Cromwell
de Knightsbridge,
Stepney et Mersey.
Excusez-moi ?
Cromwell, c'est le connard d'Anglais
qui a volé la terre de mes ancźtres
et les autres, je les ai pris
dans des chansons de rock.
Bref, vingt-deux heures demain soir.
Une navette me prendra sur le parking
derričre Russell Street.
Bien joué.
Greggs vous posera un micro
et organisera la surveillance.
Dommage qu'on ait pas encore
le bon numéro de téléphone.
Attaquer le claque
et écouter ce qu'ils en disent.
Avec de la chance, on pourra peut-źtre
les remettre sur écoute d'ici lą.
Autre chose.
Je suis plutōt surpris qu'un immigrant russe
aussi impliqué dans les magouilles
n'ait pas de fichier
dans l'ordinateur de la police.
Vous avez toujours un ami ą Woodlawn ?
Je voudrais savoir ce que le FBI
a dans ses fichiers.
Aprčs la réunion sur Barksdale,
j'ai, disons, tout fait pour l'emmerder,
vous vous rappelez pas ?
Et alors quoi ?
C'est ce que tu fais ą tout le monde.
Lui, c'est George Glekas.
Le proprio de l'entrepōt d'électroménager
oł le second conteneur a atterri.
Fais aussi une recherche sur lui.
Pourquoi on prend pas un autre gars
et on les fait pas sortir par l'allée ?
Si ces bijoux commencent ą disparaītre,
tout le monde se doutera
que c'est fait par quelqu'un de l'intérieur.
Il nous faut un coupe boulon
pour le grillage,
et il nous faut aussi
assez de poutres en bois
pour faire une piste qui traverse le gazon
et qui va jusqu'ą la route.
C'est emmerdant.
On peut faire rouler les caisses
sur le morceau d'herbe sans problčme.
On suit mon plan.
Un conteneur vient de disparaītre.
- Talco Line ?
- C'est Pakusa qui s'en occupe ?
- C'est lui. On essaie de le suivre ?
- On sait déją oł il va, non ?
Douze zéro huit, tu me reēois ?
Douze zéro huit, qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
On a un conteneur qui quitte le port
et qui vient peut-źtre chez vous.
Conteneur numéro :
Paul-Mike-Québec-Victor
quatre-zéro-zéro-sept-six-cinq,
chiffre de contrōle : deux.
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux qu'on fasse ?
- Surveillez s'il arrive.
Et s'il arrive ?
Regardez ce qui se passe ensuite.
Tu veux que je te dise un truc ?
Je commence ą croire qu'en tant
qu'enquźteurs criminels,
on n'est pas vraiment respectés.
C'est pas nécessaire, Jimmy.
Je savais bien qu'on merdait
dans l'affaire Barksdale.
C'est ce que tu disais.
On a un nouveau chef qui croit que tout
est question de loyauté et de piston.
Ēa marche pas comme ēa dans ton service.
Emmerde-les, tu finis sur un bateau.
Ici,
tu viens travailler un matin
et tu vois qu'on t'a assigné
une putain de réserve indienne poussiéreuse
perdue en Arkansas.
- Non, j'étais allé trop loin, Fitz.
- Arrźte.
C'est quoi ēa, mon frčre ?
Des Blancs, ēa te change un peu, non ?
Le truc, c'est qu'ils sont tous clean.
Et ēa c'est étrange.
Le NCI et le NADDIS n'ont rien donné.
Les douanes avaient un peu d'infos
sur ce mec-lą, Glekas.
Tu dis qu'ils avaient des infos sur lui ?
Ēa devrait źtre ici.
Je vais essayer autre chose.
On va savoir si ton type a eu
le moindre contact avec l'un de nos agents.
On a quelque chose ą San Diego.
- Sur Glekas ?
- On va voir.
AGENT ASSIGNÉ : ERNEST KOUTRIS
BUREAU : SAN DIEGO
Nouvel Appel - Statut : branché.
Commencer Appel
Pour un longue distance ą Hyattsville,
il me faut trois formulaires
et l'aval du lieutenant.
Oui, l'agent Ernest Koutris, s'il vous plaīt.
Je te rassure, ici aussi,
on croule sous la paperasse.
Agent Koutris ?
Vraiment pas grand-chose.
Le type était lié ą un vol de marchandises
sur lequel je bossais en 95, 96.
C'était un second rōle,
il a pas été accusé, mais je lai interrogé.
Le gars m'a surtout paru
źtre un minable qui jouait au futé.
Oui, si vous voulez,
je vous enverrai ce que j'ai.
Entendu.
Si vous le voulez, dites-le-moi.
Il faut qu'on discute.
T'as vu quelqu'un te suivre ?
Tu vas me ratisser toute la rue,
et tu relčves les numéros des voitures.
- Toute la semaine je l'ai fait, et rien.
- Encore.
Le camion est lą.
Yo, Lester, il est lą.
Ils déchargent quelque chose ?
Pas encore.
Trčs bien, attendez la suite.
Tu sais le problčme, Preston,
c'est que t'es incroyablement bźte.
Sérieux.
Je dis pas ēa pour te vexer. J'énonce un fait.
Il a l'air de croire le contraire.
Jamais personne ne se croit stupide.
C'est la base de la stupidité.
Inutile que tu dises
ce qui s'est passé dans cette rue.
On le sait trčs bien.
On t'a toi, on a vos flingues,
et on a cette connerie d'histoire en entier.
Il est oł l'avocat, mec ?
Lą, t'as fait une erreur, petit.
Ta faēon de regarder le sac.
Tu sais ce qu'il y a dedans ?
C'est toi. Et, t'es lą. T'as merdé.
- Je sais pas de quoi vous parlez.
- Non, t'as été nul.
On a mźme tes empreintes
sur un des flingues. On a mźme ēa, tu vois.
Ouais, lequel ?
C'est toi, sur celui-lą.
Mon avocat.
Ils ont posé des questions sur moi ?
San Diego.
San Diego, c'était il y a longtemps.
Mon ami de Washington
ignore ce qu'ils voulaient.
En tout cas, ils ont posé des questions.
Toi, tu m'as dit que les policiers
qui enquźtent sur les filles étaient de la ville.
C'est ēa.
Pas de FBI.
On a fait circuler
que des conteneurs clean ?
Oui. Et personne nous surveille.
Personne nous suit.
Personne nous arrźte dans notre truc.
Et le téléphone de l'entrepōt a été changé ?
Alors encore un jour ou deux
et on fait repartir les affaires.
On surveille, on reste trčs prudent,
mais on reprend les affaires.
On doit rendre service ą un ami, non ?
Donnant donnant.
Je choisirais les Colombiens.
Ils ont eu leurs produits
mais ont payé moins que promis.
Ą ce que je vois, ils sont tous devenus
des terroristes aujourd'hui.
Des juges sont tués, des bombes explosent
en pleine rue, ēa va trčs mal.
Les Colombiens qui nous ont
arnaqués ne sont pas avec les guérilleros.
C'est de la racaille.
Le monde est plus petit, de nos jours.
Et le FBI, il s'intéresse énormément
ą ce genre de chose.
Donnant donnant.
Sergei passe un coup de fil.
- Un autre chargement demain, mais clean ?
- Clean, oui.
S'il y a pas de problčme,
alors t'apporteras les fauteuils relax.
Je te retrouve lą-bas.
T'as reconnu cette voix ?
C'est l'homme du téléphone
de l'entrepōt, non ?
- C'est le mźme gars ?
- Mźme gars, nouveau numéro.
- T'appelles qui ?
- Pearlman, ą la maison.
Une signature et on est rebranché
sur la filičre principale.
C'est de la brute, String.
Enfin, tu peux la rallonger, cette saloperie.
D'accord.
Alors quand la police
fera sa prochaine descente dans les tours,
tu laisseras les mecs de Prop Joe
prendre les trois.
Okay.
Voilą, t'ajoutes encore ēa
ą ce que t'as déją enregistré et on y est.
Quand on commence ą relier
tous ces éléments,
on se demande
dans quoi ces types ne trempent pas.
Drogues, filles, marchandises volées. Tout.
Le FBI n'avait pas grand-chose.
Juste un petit dossier ą San Diego
sur Glekas
- et une affaire de vol qui a été classée.
- San Diego ?
Ces gars voyagent beaucoup.
- C'est quoi, ce costume ?
- Je sors, ce soir.
Le raid sur la maison close.
Tout est lą, madame.
Il faut mettre ēa sur écoute pour entendre
ce qu'ils diront sur le raid de ce soir.
C'est au nom de qui ?
Tu peux avoir les séries SL
en bleu pacifique ? Ce serait mieux.
Tout ce que tu veux, chef.
Celle-ci, je me fous de sa couleur.
Tu me fileras ce que t'as.
Aucun problčme,
mais elles auront toutes un toit ouvrant.
C'est une longue histoire.
Mardi prochain, ēa nous arrangerait.
Un bateau doit arriver tōt mercredi, alors...
Écoute,
je pourrais avoir une avance lą-dessus,
tu crois ?
Je dois payer certains frais
et je suis fauché sur les bords.
- Je demande, c'est tout.
- Paiement ą la livraison.
Hé, t'inquičte pas, chef.
Ēa me viendrait mźme pas ą l'idée d'essayer
d'arnaquer un pro du business comme toi.
Je suis déją celui qui doit penser
ą la gestion de nos affaires en général.
Faut aussi que je fasse gaffe ą tel ou tel truc,
que je m'occupe de ci,
que je vérifie que ēa a été fait.
Non, c'est pas encore assez.
C'est pour ēa qu'ils payent leurs putains
de directeurs généraux aussi bien.
Parce que quand les choses tournent mal,
ēa tourne mal pour eux.
Et tous les autres, ils peuvent esquiver,
se cacher, faire tout ce qu'ils veulent.
Alors au moment critique,
c'est moi qui dois me charger
de cette responsabilité !
Et vous, vous me laissez vraiment pas
beaucoup de cartes en jeu, en ce moment !
- Franchement, String...
- Non ! C'est une chose trčs simple, mec !
Vous roulez jusqu'au bord de l'eau.
Vous regardez autour de vous. Vous voyez
qu'il n'y a personne. Vous balancez les flingues.
Dans l'eau.
Plouf !
Allez, foutez le camp, merde.
Sauf toi, le petit.
T'as pas dit de conneries lą-bas ?
Non, ils ont été cons en me disant
que mes empreintes étaient sur un flingue.
C'est moi-mźme qui les ai tous essuyés.
Et celui qu'était ą moi d'aprčs eux,
c'était mźme pas le mien.
S'ils avaient eu autre chose que mon nom,
ils m'auraient pas laissé partir, je pense.
- Ēa roule.
- Salut, String.
Et ferme cette porte.
Un coupe boulon, vous avez ?
Il m'en faudrait un bien.
J'en ai deux dans la vitrine.
Vous aviez mis ēa ą un canard ?
Bien sūr.
Mille deux cents.
Ēa me paraīt correct.
- Nick !
- Ēa faisait un bail, Mikey.
Ouais, c'est vrai.
Mais c'est drōle, j'avais
ton nom ą l'esprit ces derniers temps.
Ah ouais ?
Mon pote a appelé.
Il a dit que tu venais me prendre un paquet.
Oui, c'est aussi ce qu'ils m'ont dit.
Nicky Sobotka dans le business.
Qui l'aurait imaginé, hein ?
- Combien t'en voudrais ?
- Deux ou trois lots d'un kilo par semaine.
Avant c'était les gars du Grec
qui me fournissaient.
- Quatre le lot.
- Quatre ?
Non, je le fourgue ą cinq moi.
J'en sais rien.
Ils ont dit que tu serais réglo avec moi,
lą-dessus.
Sergei ? Ēa va monsieur ?
J'ai un ami lą qui dit que le K
on le vend ą quatre.
Ouais ? D'accord.
D'accord, ēa va, c'est cool.
Ah ouais, autre chose.
Je voulais savoir si ce sont vos hommes
qui ont balancé le corps dans Potee Street
l'autre soir, tu sais ?
Je demande parce que ce putain d'enculé
avait un nom grec ą la con
et qu'il a été déposé
devant une maison que j'utilisais.
Il avait des doigts ? Il avait un visage ?
Oui ? C'était pas nous, alors.
Le crétin.
T'as des amis haut placés, Nicky.
- Quatre le paquet pour toi.
- Cool.
Heureusement qu'on a le portable du Russe.
Ils ont changé le numéro de l'entrepōt,
mais au moins, lui il a pas changé le sien.
Il avait des doigts ? Il avait un visage ?
Oui ? C'était pas nous, alors.
- Cette chose, c'est quoi ?
- Un sac ą main pour homme.
Les Européens dans ton style
aiment parfois en utiliser un.
Ils sont vraiment bizarres, les Européens.
Fallait bien un endroit oł cacher le micro.
T'auras peut-źtre des mains partout
sur le corps avant qu'on ait ce qu'on cherche.
Ce ne serait pas déplaisant.
Ce sera ą vous de nous dire
quand on devra intervenir.
Vous voulez qu'on entre, vous dites...
C'était quoi ?
"En pleine lucarne." C'est facile ą retenir.
Le plus important, c'est que ce sont eux
qui doivent parler d'argent et de sexe,
et il doit y avoir ensuite une tentative
ouverte de concrétisation.
En pleine lucarne.
Inspecteur Freamon,
de la brigade criminelle.
Dites-moi, qu'est-ce que vous avez, vous,
au VICAP, sur des victimes masculines
décapitées ou au visage arraché
et avec les deux mains amputées ?
New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvanie.
4,5 millions du budget vont źtre attribués
par la chambre des députés et le sénat.
L'argent sera alloué pour la période fiscale
de l'année prochaine.
Félicitations, Frank.
Un vrai docker, ēa boit pas de champagne !
Euh, Nat, pour l'élection.
Juste un an de plus, et j'obtiens le dragage.
C'est tout ce que je voudrais.
C'est le tour d'Ott, Frank.
Voici l'agent Koutris,
du FBI de Washington.
Il est avec l'équipe locale d'anti-terrorisme.
- Terrorisme ?
- Il a besoin de nous, ce soir.
Onze vingt-quatre,
oł est-ce que vous źtes ?
Je suis sur le pont routier de Wicomico.
Okay, bien reēu.
Attention c'est parti, j'arrive.
Bonsoir.
Des pigments pour peinture.
Ils sont lą pour źtre envoyés
ą l'usine SCL de Fairfield.
C'est lą-dedans, quelque part.
Ą vous de jouer !
C'est la mźme substance
dans tous les barils.
Il n'y a vraiment rien d'autre lą-dedans.
Il n'y a que des pigments.
RENSEIGNEMENTS RÉSERVÉS
Ą LA POLICE - CONFIDENTIEL
- C'est quoi ce t'histoire ?
- J'en ai aucune idée, mon vieux.
Je vous le jure !
Ce soir, je suis qu'un petit crétin
de gars blanc de Locus Point.
Je dis ēa, mais tu sais
que je le respecte, Brianna.
J'aime ce mec comme si c'était mon frčre,
mais pour ce genre de questions,
je suis sūr que de toi ou de moi,
c'est toi qu'il écoutera le plus.
Oh, tu crois ?
Ce que j'ai pu lui dire pour mon fils
n'a rien changé au résultat, t'as vu.
Et pourtant, je lui ai dit et redit
de faire davantage pour D'Angelo.
Et qu'est-ce qui est arrivé ?
Il est trčs touché.
Il est triste pour toi.
Je sais que le truc il l'a pas vu venir.
- Aucun de nous ne l'a vu venir.
- Moi si.
Je m'en suis doutée, je te jure.
Et il m'a pas écoutée.
Pourquoi il m'écouterait maintenant ?
Parce qu'on a un produit nul
et qu'on tient notre propre territoire
avec pas assez de muscles.
J'ai plus Wee-Bey, Stinkum, Bird.
Alors écoute, je sais que ton coeur souffre.
Je le sais.
Mais les loups sont juste dehors.
Tant que ces tours seront toujours debout,
je serai debout.
Je préfčre źtre maudite que de laisser
tout ce qu'on a construit źtre détruit.
Donc je lui parlerai.
Monsieur Cromwell.
J'hésite, j'hésite encore.
Ce serait malvenu d'en choisir deux ?
Ah, bravo.
On devrait monter maintenant.
COLORANT UNIVERSEL - POISON
Il n'y a que des pigments pour peinture.
Faites-moi confiance, mon ami, c'est lą.
Le fils de pute !
Bon.
D'accord.
Peut-źtre qu'on pourrait en parler avant ?
Quand vous voulez, les gars.
Ils ont encaissé l'argent, oui ou non ?
Ouais, j'en ai l'impression.
- Ils ont parlé de sexe ?
- Sans aucun doute.
C'est quand vous voulez, les gars.
Attends.
Oh, merde !
Alors, il est ą point ?
Je sais plus quoi dans la lucarne.
On y va.
- Attendez.
- Pourquoi ?
On est censé rentrer lą-dedans trčs vite.
On se calme lą, d'accord ?
Y vont pas jeter les cinq six putes
aux toilettes et tirer la chasse.
- Qui est-ce ?
- Police de Baltimore.
- Qu'est-ce que vous voulez ?
- Traīner ton cul en taule.
Les mains en l'air.
- Deux autres dans le fond.
- On y va, mesdames.
Vous źtes en retard.
Ēa va, lui ?
Il survivra.
... saisie d'environ
mille cent vingt-cinq kilos de cocaļne
dont la valeur est estimée
ą quarante-cinq millions de dollars.
Les officiers fédéraux
ont confirmé ą nos envoyés
que l'enquźte était toujours en cours
et que si aucune arrestation n'a été faite,
cette saisie aura sérieusement compromis
les opérations d'un groupe
que l'on pense lié aux organisations
narco-terroristes colombiennes.
Ēa, messieurs dames, c'est un coup de filet.
Si vous pouviez accuser mon ami
Frank Sobotka d'un forfait de ce genre,
je mourrais comblé.
Notre enquźte progresse.
- Trčs bien. Quelle est l'accusation ?
- On n'en est pas encore lą.
On a sur écoute un groupe de contrebande
lié ą la drogue et aux femmes.
Il est quasi certain que ce sont eux
qui ont fait venir les filles
retrouvées mortes dans le conteneur
il y a deux mois.
Nous surveillons un site qui sert
de lieu de transfert pour toute leur drogue.
Et la nuit derničre, vous pouvez le vérifier,
nous avons nettoyé une maison close
sans doute liée ą ce groupe.
Encore deux mois d'enquźte et d'écoute,
et on sera en mesure d'identifier
ceux qui tirent les ficelles.
- Vous avez nettoyé un bordel ?
- Résidence en front de mer. Chic.
Nom de Dieu !
Si vous trouvez un truc qui ressemble
ą une liste de clients réguliers, jetez tout.
Ą mon avis, la moitié des noms
du Bottin Mondain du Maryland sera dessus.
Pas de problčme au cours de cette descente ?
Une complication ou deux,
qu'on devrait justifier sans le moindre souci.
L'immigration s'occupe des filles.
La maquerelle, qui a une résidence légale,
a déposé une caution et a pu repartir.
Vous les avez interrogées ?
Pour des infos ?
Pas tant qu'on a nos micros.
Ils croiront ą une descente aléatoire
et on écoutera ce qu'ils se diront aujourd'hui.
Venons-en ą l'essentiel.
Vous avez avancé sur mes meurtres ?
Si ce sont bien les gens
qui ont importé ces filles,
alors oui, on avance.
Plus on en saura, plus on aura de chances
de résoudre ces affaires.
Et notre ami Frank Sobotka ?
Je vous ai pas entendu dire son nom
ne serait-ce qu'une fois.
Le syndicat mouille dans la contrebande,
mais rien en fait ne nous indique
que cela aille plus loin que ēa.
La cible, c'est Frank Sobotka.
Maintenant, on est sur un plus gros coup.
Mademoiselle. C'est mon détachement.
J'ai lancé l'enquźte.
Alors je vous le demande. Avez-vous
des charges contre Frank Sobotka ?
Si on accuse Sobotka dčs maintenant,
on perd les écoutes
et toute chance de coincer la vraie cible.
- C'est lui, la cible.
- Un peu de patience, Stan.
- Je pense que s'ils peuvent...
- Tu me devais un service, Erv.
Tu voulais une unité,
je t'ai donné une unité.
Tu voulais Daniels, je t'ai donné Daniels.
D'accord.
Maintenant que t'as gagné le vote,
tu déménages tes jolis trophées de golf
dans le bureau du grand chef !
Et tu me ranges au placard, hein ?
Des suceurs de rats, voilą ce que vous źtes !
C'est mon enquźte !
La mienne !
Et maintenant, vous allez me dire ą moi
quelle est la cible qu'on vise ?
Et merde, vous pouvez toujours rźver.
Il a dit non.
Il dit qu'on s'est battu
pour chacune des tours
et que si on lāche maintenant,
on sera catalogué comme des faibles.
Il dit que si on fait ēa,
Prop Joe aura le dessus sur nous.
Et on pourra peut-źtre jamais se relever.
- On n'a ni le produit, ni la force.
- Je lui ai dit.
Je lui ai dit.
Il a répondu qu'il nous cherchait
une meilleure connexion.
Et pour ce qui est du muscle,
il a dit qu'il nous envoyait
le meilleur gars qui existe.
Frčre Mouzone.
Il nous envoie Mouzone ?
Il débarque de New York.
Et il est prźt ą travailler sous contrat
aussi longtemps qu'on aura besoin de lui.
- Frčre Mouzone.
- Oui.
"Ą tel point que l'officier
était incapable de résister
"aux manipulations
des suspects susmentionnés,
"et s'est vu contraint
de pratiquer l'acte sexuel."
C'est une vraie merveille ton topo, tu sais.
Ce rapport va faire de toi
une légende de la police de Baltimore.
Je peux pas me parjurer
et il faut bien que je m'explique.
Fils de pute ! T'as violé une demi-douzaine
de rčglements dans cette histoire.
Sans parler du fait qu'aucun procureur
ne pourra utiliser ce rapport dans un procčs.
Il n'y aura pas de procčs,
les filles vont źtre expulsées.
On a fait cette descente
pour relancer les écoutes, tu te souviens ?
Il y en avait deux, j'ai été débordé.
Tu déconnes, lą, j'espčre.
Frčre Mouzone de New York City ?
J'ai vu Avon, je lui ai dit que lą,
on avait pas la poigne pour tenir les tours.
- Je l'ai joué comme ēa.
- Et il a trouvé ēa.
Joe, moi je maintiens notre deal.
La seule chose qui change,
c'est ce petit souci ą régler.
Et comment tu le rčgles ?
Mon frčre, si je le pouvais,
je le liquiderais cet enfoiré,
mais Avon doit pas savoir
que ēa vient de son équipe.
Tu crois pas que je vais envoyer
un de mes types se mesurer ą Mouzone ?
Tu déconnes.
Ce gars a plus de cadavres ą son tableau
qu'un cimetičre chinois.
C'est vrai.
Écoute, moi je dis que c'est ton problčme,
pas le mien.
Si tu veux mon produit,
c'est ą toi de le régler.
Attends, cool.
On a un peu de temps devant nous.
Avon va faire passer le mot
et ensuite il va attendre la réponse,
fixer le prix, discuter avec Frčre Mouzone,
tomber d'accord sur tout.
Il se sera écoulé une semaine
ou peut-źtre deux.
D'ici lą, tes gars seront dans les tours
et s'il y a l'argent qu'il faut,
alors ce sera comme ēa et c'est tout.
Et c'est pas un nčgre de New York
qui changera les faits sur le terrain.
T'es d'accord ?
MATÉRIAUX DE FRICTION INC.
Douze zéro huit ą onze trente-sept, t'es lą ?
Ici onze trente-sept, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Le dernier camion est sur le départ.
Deux jours qu'il est lą
et ils ont rien déchargé.
- Bien reēu.
- Ils nous testent.
Ce sont des conteneurs clean,
qu'ils déplacent.
- Les poubelles n'ont pas attiré de mouches.
- Non ?
- On vient de sortir la derničre. Nickel.
- Trčs bien. Allons-y, alors.
- Et Ilona ?
- Elle est rentrée. Ils ont gardé les enfants.
Des enfants, il y en aura toujours.
Pourquoi on met pas ce portable
sur écoute ? Mźme si on sait pas ą qui il est.
Ce coup de fil sera peut-źtre
le motif qu'on cherchait.
Et lui, c'est le petit seigneur
qui rčgne sur cette zone.

SUR ÉCOUTE
"Ça finit toujours
par payer d'être syndiqué." - Ziggy
Elle est cool cette came.
Tiens. Mais la prochaine fois,
tu dis à Moe qu'il nous faudrait sept ou huit
cents petites doses en plus, d'accord ?
J'ai pas vu une aussi bonne came
depuis je sais même pas quand.
- Et les grosses doses ?
- Pareil, t'en prends plus.
C'est quoi, cette merde ?
String, comment ça va ?
Ça va ? J'ai pas à me plaindre.
- La livraison ?
- C'est de la bonne.
Tu vois ces trois gueules
d'abrutis d'Eastside, là-bas ?
Je veux que tu te montres avec eux
aussi hospitalier que savent l'être
les mecs de l'Ouest de Baltimore.
- C'est clair ?
- C'est clair, on va s'enculer ces merdes.
Non.
On leur laisse la 221, la 734 et Saratoga.
On garde le reste.
Et si quelqu'un s'amusait à foutre sa merde,
c'est à moi qu'il aurait des comptes
à rendre. On est bien d'accord ?
Quelque chose qui cloche ?
Parfait.
Qu'est-ce qu'ils vont bien pouvoir foutre
dans nos tours, ces gros nazes ?
Calme-toi petit, casse-toi.
On va te montrer comment on fait du fric.
Allez, vire de là.
Salut, String.
J'écoute ce que tu dis, je te jure.
Mais cette connerie, là,
ça n'a pas de sens quoi, c'est dingue.
Tu aimes la nouvelle came qu'on écoule ?
Ça a du sens, maintenant ?
- Alors, on en est où avec le boss ?
- Il finira bien par téléphoner.
- Le PC est en fonction. Tout est en ordre.
- Il sort son portable, le gus et il est cuit.
On l'identifie illico.
Sois pas si sûr de toi. Il pourrait très bien
utiliser le téléphone de l'entrepôt,
ou le portable de Sobotka. Dans ce cas,
c'est peut-être une piste qui mène à rien.
Il existe un autre procédé.
Comparé aux écoutes téléphoniques,
le processus est un peu plus long,
mais bon, si on a pas le choix...
En un peu plus d'une semaine,
non seulement on a réussi à établir
l'identité de la plupart des protagonistes,
mais on a réussi à coller un GPS
sur toutes leurs bagnoles.
Tout d'abord...
Eton Ben-Eleazer,
le lieutenant de la drogue dans l'entrepôt.
- E-ton.
- Si tu veux.
Notre Madame, Ilona Petrovna.
George Glekas, qui dirige le magasin
d'électroménager à Highlandtown.
Sans doute la couverture de l'organisation.
On en a suivi certains en temps réel.
Regardez ce qu'on peut faire aussi
avec ce joli petit jouet.
Sept jours d'observation
des mouvements de nos cibles en accéléré.
Et regardez bien. Il n'y a que deux endroits
où trois ou quatre voitures se sont arrêtées
au même moment plus de cinq minutes.
Un des X est un des petits boxons
minables de South Clinton.
L'autre est sur la rive ouest de Fort Howard,
juste après Edgemere.
Allons-y. On obtiendra peut-être
une photo du boss.
- Ou un numéro de plaque.
- C'est carrément cool, ce truc.
- Où est-ce que vous avez trouvé ça ?
- On a trouvé ça à la DEA.
McNulty a fignolé le logiciel
avec ses potes du FBI.
On va retirer Herc et Carver de l'entrepôt
et les mettre sur South Clinton.
McNulty, Bunk, vous prenez Fort Howard.
Mais putain qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Autant les afficher, non ?
C'est vrai quoi, si tu veux te représenter,
tu vas pas le faire en cachette.
J'ai rien contre toi.
C'est juste que je tiens à finir ce que j'ai
commencé pour le projet de dragage.
Et tu penses que je serai pas assez bon
pour m'en charger, hein ?
Ça n'a rien à voir.
Ott, écoute-moi !
Qu'est-ce que tu veux que je fasse ?
Que je lui raconte d'où vient notre blé ?
L'I.B.S, hein ?
Je voudrais pas frimer, mais au FBI,
on connaît bien le racket syndical.
C'est exactement ce que je voulais entendre.
Cette affaire doit être résolue, messieurs.
Et au fond de mon coeur,
je sens que vous êtes le genre d'enculés
qui saura mettre Sobotka là où il doit être.
En tant que fédéraux, il y a une chose
pour laquelle vous pouvez m'aider.
Cela nécessitera un peu de discrétion
de votre part.
Voici la photo d'une camionnette
de surveillance
qui était entièrement équipée
lorsqu'elle a disparu.
Une camionnette de surveillance ?
Volée par Sobotka.
Et qui se trimballe je ne sais où.
La dernière photo provient de Seattle,
mais je possède des empreintes
venant de deux autres endroits.
Vous avez signalé le vol du véhicule ?
Disons que j'avais la sensation que le vol
d'un véhicule sur le parking de la police
aurait de sombres répercussions
sur nos services.
L'idée c'est que dans votre branche,
vous avez suffisamment de contacts
pour éventuellement récupérer notre bazar
sans faire trop de remous, quoi.
En guise de remerciement
pour vous avoir donné toute l'affaire.
Ces enculés de l'Est,
il faut qu'ils retournent
de l'autre côté de la ville,
là où ils devraient être.
Mais si tu les vires,
tu vires la bonne came avec, alors...
N'empêche,
ils n'arrêtent pas de faire des conneries,
ils cassent les prix, ils foutent la merde.
Amène-toi.
Quoi de neuf, soldat ?
- Il y a des affaires à faire dans le coin.
- Avec lui ? Avec ce paquet de merde ?
Je l'ai vu faire à Ashland,
l'autre jour, il arnaquait sec.
- Je t'emmerde, toi !
- Qu'est-ce qu'il t'a dit ?
Il m'a dit vingt-cinq pour deux mesures
et une pointe de coke.
Moi, je t'en donne deux pour quinze
avec la glace qui va au-dessus gratos. Alors ?
Alors, ça marche.
Va dans le hall d'entrée, je te rejoins.
Ça va être comme ça, maintenant.
Le jeu, tu vois ça va être de fourguer
plus de bonne came qu'eux.
Mais qu'est-ce que c'est que cette merde ?
Tu veux me faire croire qu'un mec de l'Ouest
est capable de vendre un truc sans mettre
son flingue sous le nez de son client ?
Et oui, gros. Et tu ferais bien de t'y faire,
parce que vous allez vendre que dalle
avant qu'on ait plus rien en stock !
- Je te le jure !
- C'est ça, mon pote. T'as raison.
Va jouer, gros lard d'enfoiré.
- Je mets ça où ?
- Là, c'est bien.
Cool, ça casse.
- Tu veux que je te l'installe ?
- T'as pas une surveillance à assurer, toi ?
- Tu ressens la même chose que moi ?
- La sensation de porter encore une couche ?
- On peut vous aider ?
- FBI. Le lieutenant Daniels ?
Il est dans son bureau.
Sans sa plaque sur ma gueule,
j'aurais jamais deviné.
Ça, c'est sûr.
- Il avait les chaussures, quand même.
- Et les gros yeux vitreux, là. Ça trompe pas.
- Et pis leur cul serré, là.
- En fait, c'était assez clair.
Lieutenant Daniels ?
Agents Settles et Mason.
Le commandant Valchek nous a dit
que vous nous attendiez.
Et toi, tu écoutes ce fou ?
Ce fou qui raconte partout que l'Est
est plus sauvage que l'Ouest,
parce que soi-disant,
les mecs de l'Est boivent du Porto ?
Et que les mecs de l'Ouest
boivent du Sherry ?
Le Porto rend les hommes fous, c'est vrai.
- Butchie, parle à cet inculte.
- Pour moi, de toute façon,
la seule différence entre l'Est et l'Ouest
se résume à un seul mec.
- Frank Matthews.
- Pee Wee Matthews ?
Lui, il est allé à New York
et il s'est mouillé avec les Italiens.
C'est le seul homme de cette ville
à avoir eu sa part de la French Connexion.
Mais qu'est-ce que Pee Wee
vient faire là-de dans ?
Pee Wee était de l'Ouest.
La came a envahi l'Ouest.
Avec un bon fournisseur,
ça devient un business normal.
Quand ça merdait, il y avait une raison.
Pas comme aujourd'hui.
Excusez-moi.
Qu'est-ce que t'as dit, Omar ?
Rien.
T'as vu que j'avais quelque chose pour toi ?
Sinon je viendrais pas.
Alors, comment ça va, maître Butch ?
Ça va quand je m'inquiète pas pour toi.
Tiens, c'est pour mes hommes.
Et ça, c'est pour les jours sans soleil.
Tu t'es fait un joli paquet de fric
ces dernières années.
C'est peut-être le moment
de prendre tes distances ?
Et pour aller où ?
À plus tard, Butch.
Tu me suis pas, le chien.
Putain, t'es con !
J'ai même pas fait le trou encore.
Putain, arrête cette connerie de radio,
merde !
Super boulot.
Et comme je dis toujours, ça finit toujours
par payer d'être syndiqué.
- Éteins cette radio, Zig !
- Tu viens poser ton cul dans cette bagnole,
on a pas toute la nuit non plus.
Un tank pourrait passer par ce trou,
sans une égratignure.
Tu vas où comme ça ?
En Grèce. À Athènes, pour être précis.
Le trou, c'est pour qu'ils se disent
que c'est pas des mecs de l'intérieur.
Du coup ils cherchent pas dans le syndicat !
Bienvenue à bord, chef.
C'est toi ?
Je croyais que tu devais
aller faire les courses.
- Moi ?
- Oui, toi.
Je suis en surveillance vingt-quatre heures
sur vingt-quatre.
Quand est-ce qu'on en arrive
au moment où tu fais des trucs pour moi ?
Hein, à quel moment
tu trouveras ça justifié ?
Tu en es donc arrivée au stade où tu ne peux
même plus faire les courses ?
Tu veux essayer d'être dans cet état ?
Quelque chose qui cloche ?
Bébé tricote. Tu veux sentir ?
- Presque quatre mille dollars.
- Et oui.
Tu sais le Grec, le mec de l'entrepôt.
Il me paye tout en liquide.
Comme ça, rien d'écrit,
et il a pas besoin de payer les charges.
- Et tu as économisé tout cet argent ?
- Il m'a donné un petit bonus.
Je gagne 700 $ par semaine.
Tu me crois pas ?
Putain.
Si j'ai économisé ce fric,
c'est pour t'offrir un nouvel appartement.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire, quoi ?
Je comprends rien à comment
elles fonctionnent, ces salopes.
Avec moi, c'est : "Soit tu suces les bites,
soit tu suces pas les bites."
- Messieurs.
- Quel vent t'amène, mon frère ?
Tu vends des tartes aux haricots, c'est ça ?
La nation est derrière toi ?
Parce que, soit t'es musulman,
soit il faut que tu dises à ta mère
d'arrêter de préparer tes fringues le matin.
Je suis ici pour représenter
les intérêts de monsieur Barksdale.
- Le nom de Barksdale vous est-il familier ?
- Il est connu, mais moi aussi, je suis connu.
Et vous êtes ?
Cheese, man.
Monsieur Cheese. Je vois.
- Et vous travaillez pour qui, M. Cheese ?
- Pour qui je travaille ?
Ai-je raison d'imaginer que vous n'êtes pas
employé par monsieur Barksdale ?
Ça, oui.
Dans ce cas, je dois insister
pour que vous quittiez les lieux.
- Il est rigolo, lui.
- Laissez-moi être emphatique.
Transportez votre gros cul noir
de l'autre côté de Charles Street.
- Quoi ?
- Attends.
Il sait pas ce qui dit. Il est pas au courant.
Premièrement,
on a la permission de dealer dans ces tours.
Et deuxièmement, je supporte pas...
Putain ! Lâchez-moi !
Munitions en plastique. Pour les rats.
Ce qui doit vous préoccuper à présent,
c'est ce qui se trouve dans le chargeur.
Une fabrication maison à tubulaire
chemisée de cuivre
chargée de cent vingt graines
de mon invention.
Ainsi, devez-vous réfléchir
et vous interroger de la façon suivante :
que devrais-je faire avant que ce mec
ne pointe son flingue encore une fois ?
On se tire.
Je vous souhaite une excellente journée.
Je suis entièrement d'accord
avec ce que nous venons d'entendre.
À priori,
cette enquête est idéale
pour appliquer la loi RICO.
Mon service est d'accord. Ce sera donc
dans vos tribunaux, non dans le mien.
De mon côté, je n'exigerai
qu'une seule chose.
Depuis le 11 septembre,
le FBI a la priorité dans cette affaire :
c'est de la corruption maritime.
C'est un nouveau monde
et les ports sont très vulnérables.
Cette affaire déborde le cadre des syndicats.
Et nous sommes d'accord
pour en assumer l'intégralité.
Mais c'est grâce au syndicat
que nous sommes dans cette pièce.
Alors, si vous êtes d'accord,
nous unirons nos efforts.
Nous ferons donc des copies
pour le lieutenant et Mlle Pearlman.
Je compte sur vous pour faire parvenir
au FBI vos propres dossiers.
Je vais commencer à mettre votre travail
sur informatique
et voir quelles pistes cela peut nous ouvrir.
Tu serais pas mieux en train de te reposer ?
Une blessure par balle,
faut pas déconner avec.
L'épaule, elle a mal.
Mais celui-là, il est en pleine forme.
Va dire à Stack de le faire briller un peu,
et d'écrire sept dollars cinquante dessus.
Ça aurait été dommage de jeter un bon
grille-pain pour une histoire de fil arraché.
Bon, primo c'est pas la faute
des petits gars de la Cité.
Les gars de l'Ouest sont encore plus mal
que toi avec ton épaule !
Crois-moi. Dès que notre bonne came
sera écoulée, ils seront baisés.
Secondo. Une bonne douzaine
de tireurs de grande classe
a déjà été rendre visite à Frère Mouzone.
Aucun n'a survécu pour raconter l'histoire !
Si on attaque ce gars-là,
j'ose même pas envisager les dégâts.
Et si Stringer lui tire dessus,
il s'oppose à Avon sur ce coup-là.
Mets sa tête à prix.
Envoie un buteur à gage
lui faire exploser sa gueule de rat !
Si je mets sa tête à prix,
il viendra me voir jusque dans mon pieu !
Putain ! Plutôt me flinguer moi-même
que d'attendre ce fou !
Il y a un garçon qui pourrait nous résoudre
cette histoire.
Le truc, c'est qu'il n'acceptera pas
la somme habituelle.
Tu vises celui du centre.
Une seule balle devrait suffire.
Pas de problème.
Et je prends les trois sur la gauche.
Ils sont cons, ceux-là !
- Comment ça va ?
- Ça va, mon vieux ?
Le S221. Tu l'as plus ?
Apparemment, non.
Alors messieurs,
on est en train de faire l'inventaire ?
J'espère qu'il n'y a pas eu trop de vols.
C'est fou ce qu'on a comme soucis
sur les docks.
- Tu as réussi à sortir les voitures ?
- Elles naviguent sur la Caspienne.
Listées en tant que ferraille d'aluminium.
Et j'ai gardé le bon d'expédition.
Pas ici.
Dans mon bureau.
Excuse-moi, mais qu'est-ce qui me prouve
que le conteneur ne voyage pas à vide ?
Ça, je sais pas. Laisse-moi réfléchir...
Peut-être que si j'avais un 4 Mpix, avec zoom
3X optique entièrement numérique,
j'aurais pu prendre des chouettes photos
des Mercedes dans leur caisse.
Mais c'est trop con...
On m'a cassé ma super machine.
Ou alors, tu sais ce que je pourrais faire ?
Je pourrais demander au vieux Boris
de traîner sur les docks,
lui dire de garder son oeil rouge
de communiste sur les conteneurs
pour vérifier que les mecs des docks
sont des réglos.
- C'est bien ce que j'ai commandé ?
- Oui.
Je t'ai déniché la série S,
et dans les couleurs que tu voulais.
J'en ai même une garée dehors,
tu veux la voir ?
Devant chez moi ? Maintenant ?
Juste le temps d'une petite virée, chef.
Je la ramène au bercail ce soir.
On a un souci, là.
Ces bagnoles s'envolent pour plus
de soixante mille dollars chacune.
Vingt pour cent, c'était la semaine dernière.
Aujourd'hui, la cote est à dix.
Et encore, ça fait pas mal d'argent,
pour quelques heures de boulot.
Non !
Il en est foutrement pas question !
On avait un deal, fils de pute, un deal !
Écoute-moi bien !
C'était mon cul qui s'agitait
en première ligne, le mien !
Et maintenant un débris de chiotte...
C'est tout ce que t'as trouvé à me proposer ?
Tu joues pas avec moi de cette façon !
Tu joues pas !
Va te faire foutre !
Espèce d'enculé de voleur de Grec à la con.
Malaka !
Tu la connaissais pas celle-là.
Tu connais "malaka", hein ?
Maintenant, tu connais malaka
avec une robe.
S'il te plaît.
Malaka.
Est-ce que vous m'entendez ?
Si vous ne pouvez pas parler,
surtout restez en ligne.
INFRACTION
Non, d'abord tu montes sur le bateau,
après tu mets ton gilet.
- C'est carrément plus pratique.
- Oui ?
D'accord, t'essaies de me noyer,
c'est ça hein ?
- Allez, monte !
- Attention, ne pousse pas.
Canne à pêche.
C'est bon.
Tiens. Prends ça.
Je connais ce genre de truc !
Miel Pampano - MECHANICSBURG, PA.
Stringer Bell est venu me voir.
Il dit qu'il a quelque chose
à éclaircir avec Omar.
Il t'a pas dit de quoi il était question ?
Il a pas voulu me le dire.
Pour être honnête, je préférerais pas savoir.
Non. Je le sens pas, ce coup.
Tu sais bien que les hommes de Barksdale,
on peut pas leur faire confiance.
Je cherche pas à contredire ce que tu dis,
mais Stringer veut palabrer.
Alors Omar devra bien réfléchir
comme il faut.
Parce que si aujourd'hui
il gagne sa vie dans la rue,
je saurai pas garantir ce que sera
la prochaine étape, s'il refuse une rencontre.
- "Palabrer" ?
- C'est ce qu'il a dit vouloir faire.
Je le dirai à Omar.
Mais à mon avis,
ça va surtout lui sonner bizarre.
Et je crois pas que ça va pas servir
à grand-chose, tu vois.
Si tu crois que ça pourrait aider,
je peux assurer la protection.
- On a pas eu de casse la dernière fois.
- Il y avait une bonne raison.
- Cette fois, c'est différent.
- Oui, c'est vrai.
Peut-être que Stringer essaie
de faire le point sur le fait
que lui aussi il faut qu'il vive
de cette ville.
Omar étant Omar.
Si tu n'y vois pas d'inconvénient,
je me sentirais carrément mieux
si mon neveu avait une protection.
Hayward.
On a juste besoin d'un petit autographe.
- Merci.
- De rien.
Il faut juste que tu paraphes
et que tu signes en bas de chaque page.
Je suis en train de relire.
C'est le rapport officiel, c'est ça chef ?
C'est ce qui va servir au tribunal.
Je peux changer quelque chose ?
Oui.
Mets tes initiales à côté de ce que tu changes.
Et il n'y a pas de problème.
Là, il y a juste un truc.
- Vous avez tapé : "a dit", là, vous voyez ?
- "A dit" ?
Il a pas dit :
"S'il te plaît, ne me tire pas dessus."
C'était plutôt qu'il suppliait.
Vous comprenez ? Double G, il me suppliait.
Mais je veux dire,
ça risque pas de vous embrouiller, hein ?
Non, c'est plus descriptif comme ça.
C'est bien. Merci.
C'est calme. Personne dedans, ni dehors.
C'est la classe ici, les gars.
Le reflet de la lune dans l'eau.
Les vagues qui lèchent doucement
la coque du bateau.
Quand je travaille mes huit heures,
je peux gérer, tu vois.
Mais une enquête comme celle-ci...
C'est ce que je voulais savoir.
Si quelque chose arrivait,
comment tu t'organiserais ?
Je veux dire à la maison, avec les enfants.
Jusque-là,
il ne s'est pas passé grand-chose.
Mais disons qu'il se passe quelque chose.
On lance un raid. Qu'est-ce que tu ferais ?
Je demanderais à la baby-sitter de rester,
ou j'appellerais mes parents, comme ce soir.
Enfin, tu sais comment c'est,
avec les enfants. Faut que tu sois là.
Mais ça te ferait rien, toi ?
Je sais pas, tout le monde part à l'attaque,
et toi, tu dois rentrer ?
Quand ça se passera, en fait je ne sais pas
quelle sera ma réaction.
- Merci.
- Il n'y a pas de problème.
Tu veux téléphoner à quelqu'un ?
Une fois à Madison,
ça peut être long avant de pouvoir le faire.
La liberté sous caution,
il y a peu de chance, hein ?
T'as pas de la famille ?
Bon alors, pour faire court,
nous avons des agents au Havre.
Ils ont des pistes du manifeste du bateau
de la Talco censé arriver sous peu.
Nous devrions pouvoir repérer l'origine
des conteneurs illégaux.
Ça en fait un paquet à vérifier.
Cent dix exactement.
Combien d'agents vous faudra-t-il
pour vérifier l'origine de ces conteneurs ?
Et bien, autant qu'il en faudra.
On est peut-être des trous du cul,
mais au moins, on est sacrément nombreux.
Bon, je vais rentrer ça dans l'ordinateur
pour nos gars en Europe.
Rien à signaler du côté du bouiboui ?
Herc et Carver n'ont rien remarqué.
Les fédéraux ont pris la relève, ce matin.
Tout est calme.
Bon, et bien je retourne sur l'eau.
Un appel et on sait qui est ce type.

Le bateau de la Talco arrive mercredi.
J'envoie Nick pour un numéro sur ce coup.
- C'est encore les Grecs ?
- Qui d'autre ?
Ils remuent sacrément bien la merde,
ces Grecs.
- Oncle Frank ?
- Salut mon gars ! Juste à l'heure.
- Oncle Frank.
- Quoi ? Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
- Putain, qu'est-ce qu'il a encore fait ?
- Il a flingué...
Ils disent qu'il a flingué deux des Grecs.
- La nuit dernière.
- Flingué ?
- Il a flingué ?
- Merde, c'est pas vrai !
Il est en taule.
Il est poursuivi pour meurtre !
- Deux Grecs ?
- Double G...
Et un des gars
qui bosse au magasin avec lui.
Ils disent qu'il est entré.
- Il est entré.
- Pourquoi il était là ?
- Et toi, t'étais où, connard ?
- Oncle Frank, je savais pas.
Tu savais pas quoi ?
- Que foutait Ziggy avec les Grecs ?
- Je sais pas.
T'en sais rien ! Tu devrais savoir !
Tu es son cousin !
Et toi, tu es son père.
Mille cent vingt-cinq kilos...
Ce n'est pas que je suive de très près
les résultats de la lutte anti-drogue,
mais c'est la plus grosse saisie de crack
jamais enregistrée.
J'aurais préféré vous apporter
de meilleures nouvelles.
Vous m'aviez dit que c'était juste
une action locale.
Ça s'est élargi. Le FBI est impliqué
et on surveille de près les syndicats du port.
J'ai les mains liées.
Vous avez été placés sur écoute.
Plusieurs téléphones, plusieurs adresses.
Stefanos.
Envoie le garçon à Eton.
Qu'il lui dise de venir tout de suite
à l'autre endroit.
- Tu peux pas l'appeler ?
- Pas de téléphone. Plus jamais.
Adieu, mon ami.
Ils ont oublié tes frites.
Non. Ils ont oublié tes frites.
- Mes frites à moi, elles sont là.
- Ce sont mes frites.
Tu comprends tout de travers.
Ces frites, ce sont mes frites.
Vas-y.
Mange-les, les frites, gros lard !
C'est tout ce que tu sais faire.
Comment ? Tu trouves que je suis gros ?
Voilà notre homme.
- Lester, Eton s'en va.
- C'est bon, on l'a.
- Pas besoin d'une filature virtuelle ?
- Non, pas besoin.
Putain de bordel de dieu.
J'en avais entendu parler,
mais il fallait que je le voie.
- Et évidemment...
- Commandant ?
Et dire que je vous faisais confiance,
enculés de fédéraux !
Vous m'avez déçu.
- Pourrions-nous parler dans mon bureau ?
- Lieutenant.
C'est bien lieutenant, non ?
Je vous avais confié
une mission très simple :
me coffrer celui qui est dans le coin, là.
Et pour que tout se passe bien,
je vous ai offert tout ça.
De beaux locaux, des hommes,
tout ce dont vous aviez besoin.
Et qu'est-ce que vous m'avez donné ?
Vous me l'avez mis dans le cul, lieutenant.
- Commandant, nous allons...
- Roland, prends tes affaires.
Vous voulez le faire à votre façon ?
Très bien.
Mais vous n'utiliserez pas mes hommes
pour m'enculer !
- Attrape tes affaires, je te sors de là.
- Mais j'ai... Il y a du travail...
- Tu avais dit...
- Ramène ton petit cul dans mon service,
avant que je te colle un rapport
pour insubordination.
Allez, bouge ! Couille molle !
Oh, bon Dieu !
Inspecteur, dans mon bureau.
Base à onze trente-quatre.
La cible deux arrive sur vous.
Okay, bien reçu. On est sur le coup.
On est sur le boss.
Mon Dieu.
- Il les a butés tous les deux ?
- Il a tué George dans le magasin.
- Et il a laissé le gosse se vider de son sang.
- Et pourquoi ?
Pour une dispute pour quelques bagnoles ?
- Ce petit Polack ?
- Il est complètement fou, ce mec !
La police le tient.
La police est encore sur place ?
Tu vas au magasin.
Tout ce que la police a laissé,
papiers, photos, tout ce qui reste,
tu nettoies tout.
L'entrepôt aussi. Tout doit être nettoyé.
Absolument tout.
Et les téléphones sont morts.
T'as vu ce qu'ils viennent de faire ?
Ils balancent leurs téléphones.
Onze trente-quatre à surveillance.
- On vous écoute.
- On a notre homme.
Cible numéro un :
homme blanc, la quarantaine, plutôt petit.
Il porte une chemise claire
et une casquette grise.
Description bien reçue.
Onze trente-quatre à surveillance.
Les cibles sont en mouvement.
Impossible d'assurer la suite d'où l'on est.
À vous de jouer.
Bien reçu.
Dis donc, qu'est-ce qu'il faisait
avec ce truc à la main ?
Quelque chose d'assez classique,
mon vieux.
Ils envoyaient probablement un texto.
Mes gosses sont dingues de ces trucs-là.
Dis donc, c'est notre homme, ça ?
Machin truc Sobotka. Le mec de la drogue.
Il faut que je voie Vondas.
C'est qui ?
Spiros. Où est-il ?
Je ne connais pas de Spiros.
- C'est trop classe !
- Alors je craque et "pam", c'est parti ?
- Daniels a ordonné un rapport écrit.
- Même à nous, les "costards".
C'est assez rusé. Daniels est un gros malin.
- Il est où, Prez, maintenant ?
- Daniels le ramène chez lui.
- Je crois pas qu'il reviendra ici.
- Le sait-on jamais ?
Il va peut-être utiliser
un de ses tours de psychologie à la con
et réussir à gagner l'immunité
ou un truc comme ça.
Valchek lui avait déjà donné l'immunité
et il lui a mis sur la gueule.
PORTABLE DU CHAUFFEUR
PAS D'ACTIVITÉ - 18 HEURES
- Rien depuis la rencontre de Fort Howard.
- Alors le téléphone, c'est fini.
Quand tu utilises ton portable et que
tu appuies sur "envoyer", il va où l'appel ?
- Pourquoi tu veux savoir ?
- Le boss à fort Howard.
Il a balancé le portable
qu'on surveillait, d'accord.
Et il a pris un truc bidule, là,
et il a écrit un message.
Oui, ça s'appelle un texto.
Ça passe par une de ces tours
installées partout dans la ville, non ?
Et ça finit dans un ordi,
chez un fournisseur de portables.
Si tu sais quand le message a été envoyé,
tu peux le tracer grâce à une des tours ?
Dans ce cas, ça devrait te donner
un numéro de téléphone.
Et une fois que tu as le numéro,
tu as la facture détaillée.
T'as une idée du nombre de personnes
qui utilisent un téléphone portable ?
Il y en a des milliers,
des centaines de milliers chaque seconde.
Ce qu'il te faut, c'est une autre variable.
Une variable qui t'aidera à différencier
l'appel que tu recherches des autres.
Et si tu savais d'où l'appel a été passé ?
Je veux dire exactement d'où il a été passé ?
On était au milieu de nulle part.
C'est sacrément précis, ça.
Les quais de Fort Howard, c'est moins
fréquenté que la Bourse de New York.
T'as un autre problème.
Trouver la compagnie de portable.
Il y a Verizon, MCI, AT&T, Sprint...
Une épingle dans une botte de foin.
Il y en a des douzaines.
Lamar ?
- Où est mon Harper's ?
- C'est quoi ça ?
Harper's. Le dernier numéro.
Vous l'aviez pas dit.
Vous avez dit The New Republic et Atlantic
- et le nouveau quelque chose.
- Je n'ai pas oublié de te dire Harper's.
Je te dis toujours la même chose
et tu oublies la moitié de ce que je te dis.
Demain matin, tu descends au kiosque,
et tu achètes mon Harper's.
Et The Nation,
que tu as également réussi à oublier.
Sais-tu quelle est la chose
la plus dangereuse en Amérique ?
Un nègre avec une carte de bibliothèque.
Putain, toute la journée,
il est assis et il bouquine.
Et les mecs de l'Est,
il en a pas un qui ose approcher.
- Ouais, ça c'est du vrai muscle.
- Putain !
Mais qu'est-ce qu'on va devenir
quand on aura écoulé la bonne merde ?
C'est ça qui faut qu'on se pose
comme question.
Hé, Bodie, si String
veut des gars de l'Est sur notre terrain,
pourquoi Barksdale envoie quelqu'un
pour les virer ?
Ça sert à rien, on va nulle part.
À Pyramid, c'est le silence complet.
Et aucun des fournisseurs
n'a une de nos cibles.
Alors, c'est à McNulty de jouer.
Onze trente-cinq, comment ça se passe ?
- Je viens d'arriver sur les lieux.
- Je t'écoute.
10-4. Latitude d'abord :
nord, 39 degrés. 11.727.
Longitude : ouest, 76 degrés. 26.628.
Vous venez de frapper un grand coup.
Personne n'avait fait ça avant vous.
Identifier un portable
en utilisant l'heure et le GPS.
On a tout sur le téléphone
qui a envoyé des textos
à partir de cette adresse
aujourd'hui à 16 h 45.
Juste une citation à comparaître ?
Avec ça, vous n'aurez que des informations
sur le compte et le numéro.
Mais avec un mandat de recherche,
vous pourrez obtenir deux mois
de tous les textos envoyés.
Vous avez deux mois de textos
dans ce dossier ?
Deux mois, si vous avez un mandat.
Voilà ce qu'on va faire.
On va rentrer chez nous et on va gentiment
aller taper ce mandat à la machine.
Mais là, tout de suite,
ça nous arrangerait beaucoup
de jeter un oeil sur ce que notre homme
a fait ces dernières vingt-quatre heures.
Circonstances obligent, monsieur.
Merci, mon frère.
Oh c'est pas vrai !
Ça coule jamais la vie.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Ils ont viré leurs téléphones.
On essaie de mettre la main
sur les textos du boss.
Évidemment,
tous leurs messages sont en grec.
Mais normalement,
l'ordinateur devrait les traduire.
On a quelque chose.
Traduire le texte - FERMETURE IMMÉDIATE
Fait chier.
Bonsoir, Prissy.
J'étais sûre que tu serais là.
Enculé de Ziggy.
Il réussit toujours à merder.
Tu te souviens quand il faisait
des fausses cartes d'identité ?
On lui avait tous confié notre fric.
Tu nous avais conduits à Brooklyn Park,
dans un motel minable.
Dans la Chevrolet jaune vomi de ma mère.
On s'était tous mis d'accord.
Deux bouteilles de Pikesville Rye et...
du Southern Confort pour moi.
Et qu'est-ce qu'il a ramené ce couillon ?
Des bouteilles de Boones Farm.
Il a dit que c'était ce qu'on buvait à la fac.
Mais on a fait la fête quand même,
au même endroit qu'aujourd'hui.
Il était debout, là.
Une bouteille dans chaque main,
criant assez fort pour réveiller des nonnes.
Qu'est-ce qu'il criait déjà ?
"Les étudiants, c'est pas des cons !"
Oh enculé de Zig !
- Oui ?
- Beadie, c'est Kima.
On part faire un raid.
- Un raid ? Cette nuit ?
- Tu peux faire garder tes petits ?
Pas de problème.
Je vais les emmener chez mes parents.
Alors on se retrouve tout à l'heure.
Kima, merci pour l'appel. À tout de suite.
Le juge voudrait savoir
dans combien de temps.
On y est presque.
Appareils Électroménagers Internationaux
Jetez cette rangée. Allez.
Debout Baltimore. Il est six heures.
Police !
PYRAMID INC.
CAMIONNAGE ET ENTREPOSAGE
Prêts ?
Pas un geste, FBI !
- La voie est libre.
- Contrôlez l'étage. J'y vais.
Tournez-vous. Tournez-vous.
Mains en l'air. Derrière la nuque.
Restez comme ça.
RAS. Tout est dégagé.
Objectif entièrement sous contrôle.
La voie est libre.
Vous trouverez rien, bon Dieu !
Autant vous le dire tout de suite putain.
J'ai rien chez moi.
J'ai pas de dope chez moi.
Oh ! Bordel ! Vous trouverez rien !
Je vous le dis, rien du tout.
En route, l'enflure.
On y va. FBI ! Tendez vos mains !
Couche-toi ! À terre, putain ! À terre !
Pas mal.
Bingo les gars.
MANDAT DE PERQUISITION
- C'était derrière votre machine à laver.
- C'est de l'héroïne. Trois cents gélules.
Et aujourd'hui dans
son Chip Franklin Show,
Chip sera en direct de la galerie marchande
de Rumblemill pour demander aux vendeurs
ce qu'ils ont à proposer
à ceux qui ont déjà tout.
Mais d'abord Steve Stewart aux sports.
Les Orioles continuent de...
SUR ÉCOUTE
"Je dois aller me changer." - Sobotka
Un docker emprisonné après une fusillade.
- Ils auraient pu l'arrêter tout de suite.
- Pas assez de preuves.
Putains de Fédéraux.
À vos postes, la cible vingt-sept se déplace.
Je comprends pas.
Pourquoi laisser Vondopoulos en liberté ?
Le texto lui ordonnant de faire le ménage
venait d'un plus haut placé.
Mais on ne sait pas de qui.
Après nos descentes,
si on le laisse en liberté,
il va sans doute entrer en contact
avec cette personne
soit par texto, soit en la rencontrant.
Alors, et George Glekas ?
J'ai bien peur qu'il soit passé
à côté du mandat.
- Chester Karol Sobotka ?
- C'est le fils de Frank Sobotka.
Le fils de Frank tue une de nos cibles !
Vous vous foutez de moi ?
Pourquoi ? Pour quelle raison ?
On a visité le magasin ce matin.
Il n'y avait plus le moindre bout de papier.
Rien qu'une tâche de sang par terre.
Du coup on va chez lui
une demi-heure plus tard avec le mandat.
Toute la famille grecque nous regardait,
en larmes, comme si on était cinglés.
Shak, Brigade Criminelle.
- Oui, ici Daniels du Sud-Est.
- Oui, monsieur ?
Qui a répondu pour le meurtre
de Highlandtown il y a deux nuits ?
Jay Landsman.
J'arrive tout de suite.
Commencez les interrogatoires.
BIENS VOLES
Décédé - GEORGE GLEKAS
- Lieutenant ?
- Eh, lieutenant.
Eh bien, qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Alors où on en est ce matin ?
Eton, Sergeï et la taulière ont été arrêtés.
Glekas, je suis pas sûr.
- Pour Sobotka, les Fédéraux attendent.
- Ils attendent quoi ?
Vous tenez pas à le savoir.
Seigneur, Larry, je...
maintenant l'important est de trouver
très vite un avocat pénaliste.
Ceux du syndicat peuvent pas gérer ça...
Demain, il aura sa première comparution.
- Tu as d'autres détails ?
- Euh, je sais rien de plus,
sauf qu'il est coffré pour ça.
Je le verrai pas avant 10 h 00.
- C'est le seul moment ?
- Ouais, c'est l'heure des visites.
Frank, tout se passera bien.
- FBI ! On se bouge ! Allez !
- Putain, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Tout le monde en rang.
- FBI ! Vite !
Il est là, je le sais. Il est là.
Ici aussi, j'ai un problème, Larry.
Le héros des docks.
T'as l'air moins héroïque à présent.
Maman...
Papa...
Ça a été emmené.
L'argent aussi a été emmené.
Ils ont dit
que tu devrais aller te présenter.
Ils ont dit que le mandat
était au commissariat du district sud-est.
Ils sont devant la porte. En route.
En scène, Frankie.
- Frank.
- Vos réactions ?
Est-ce seulement vous ou tout le syndicat ?
Frank, qu'avez-vous à répondre
aux accusations portées contre vous ?
Quand comptez-vous vous exprimer,
monsieur Sobotka ?
Que répondez-vous aux accusations
portées à votre encontre ?
Dites-moi pour qui exactement
j'enquête sur les meurtres de ces filles ?
La brigade criminelle, hein ?
Celle qui est incapable d'additionner
deux et deux ou de décrocher le téléphone
et qui attend que je le lise trente-six heures
après dans le Baltimore Sun.
- Qu'avez-vous comme indice ?
- Empreintes, photos, douilles.
Ils ont effacé tout le reste, hein ?
Même venant d'une brigade de police.
Vraiment merdique ce coup-là.
Qu'est-ce qu'il dit le gamin ?
Ben, il a signé des aveux complets,
il dit qu'une dispute a éclaté à propos
d'une ou deux voitures volées.
Vous croyez qu'il va nous en dire plus ?
Il a été inculpé et on lui a donné un avocat.
Si vous voulez cuisiner le gamin
il faudra squeezer son avocat.
Désolé, lieutenant. C'est ma faute.
Donne ton nom, pauvre type. Ton nom ?
C'est quoi ton nom, hein ?
Votre nom.
Allez, vous connaissez la musique.
Donnez votre nom.
Le voilà votre nom.
Quel est votre nom ?
Alors t'as pas de nom ?
- Ben pour le moment on va t'appeler Boris.
- Boris.
Pourquoi toujours "Boris" ?
Racket. Fraude sur les scellés.
Complicité de trafic d'héroïne.
Complicité pour violation
du code fédéral des douanes.
Et enfin, traite des blanches.
Aujourd'hui, nous n'instruisons que
la violation du code fédéral, M. Sobotka.
Mais une mise en cause devant
grand jury risque de vous faire plus mal.
Donnez des noms et faites des aveux.
Pour votre bien et celui de votre syndicat.
Aider mon syndicat ?
Ça va faire vingt-cinq ans
qu'on crève tout doucement ici.
Les cales sèches qui rouillent.
Les quais qui restent vides.
Pour mes amis et leurs enfants,
c'est comme un cancer.
Personne pour nous lancer durant
ces années. On n'a rien eu de personne.
Et aujourd'hui vous voudriez nous aider ?
M'aider ?
- Votre nom complet ?
- Michael McArdle.
- White Mike.
- Oui, c'est ça.
Écoutez ça Mikey.
Je veux savoir si ce sont vos gens...
qui ont jeté ce corps,
rue Potee, l'autre nuit.
Parce que c'était quelqu'un
avec un putain de nom grec,
et du diable si on l'a pas largué
devant une de mes planques.
Avait-il des mains ? Un visage ?
Oui ? Alors c'était pas nous.
On a arrêté vos fournisseurs.
Ils ont gagné gros
et vous font porter le chapeau.
- Fournisseurs de quoi ?
- Vous parlez de drogue sur la bande.
Nous avons aussi des photos de vous
devant votre planque
et devant l'entrepôt du Grec
où vous vous approvisionnez.
N'allez pas vous enfoncer plus, Mike.
- Comment on procède ?
- C'est une formalité, Frank.
Vous risquez pas de vous enfuir,
vous êtes pas récidiviste.
Et jusque-là,
il n'y a qu'un chef d'accusation.
Le magistrat va donc nous poser
des questions élémentaires.
Sauf imprévu,
vous êtes dehors dans une heure.
- J'ai rien dit à ces branleurs.
- C'est parfait.
- Et cet Eton est chargé de quoi exactement ?
- De la dope.
Il est quoi ? Grec ?
Il est juif.
Mais au pays des juifs vous savez ?
- Et euh, celui qu'ils appellent Sergueï ?
- Sergueï, c'est que du muscle.
- Écoutez, là il faut que je mange.
- Bon, qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Deux hot-dogs et un soda à la fraise.
Moi, je vais en oublier la moitié.
Et il faut que ce soit à la fraise ?
Oui, mon gros.
Pas de ça avec Omar.
Ça va.
Ça fait combien ? Un an ?
Putain, j'ai rêvé de me retrouver
en face de toi.
Tu perds pas le nord. Je dois reconnaître.
Il faut ça quand on a du boulot à faire.
Tu me suis ?
Oh, je pense que t'en as fait assez.
Bird liquidé, Wee Bey qui écope
pour tous les meurtres.
Il est en prison
et il est pas près d'en sortir.
Stinkum ? Je pense que tu as toi-même
tourné la page pour lui.
Avon. Il est sur la touche pour le moment.
Il n'y a plus que toi.
- Tu voudrais en finir, hein ?
- Non, mon vieux, j'en ai pas l'intention.
À moins que Brandon sorte de sa tombe
et apparaisse dans cette pièce à l'instant.
Et puis, je sais une chose.
Peu importe qui lui a fait ça, je l'aurai.
Ceux qui l'ont fait de cette façon.
Ils sont toujours dans la nature.
Oh, maintenant tu vas faire
celui qui n'y est pour rien.
Non, je peux pas te mentir.
J'ai mis un contrat sur vous deux,
mais vous, vous avez braqué ma planque.
Et à partir de là... faut jouer la règle.
Admettons. Mais avec Brandon,
elle a été dépassée.
Pas à cause de moi. Ni d'Avon d'ailleurs.
Bird et ses gars étaient là pour voir.
Mais c'est un autre mec qui en a rajouté.
Les trucs avec la cigarette.
Toutes ces conneries avec les yeux.
Et aujourd'hui ce mec,
il s'est taillé une sacrée réputation.
Et il rêve de te descendre.
La cruauté c'est, comment dire,
sa carte de visite.
Un petit enculé en noeud pap,
qui vient d'où déjà ?
De New York ?
Un petit guignol.
Comment il s'appelle ?
Brother Mouzone.
T'en as déjà entendu parler ?
Si tu as toujours l'intention de le retrouver,
je peux peut-être te mettre sur sa trace.
Pourquoi ?
Ce qui est arrivé à ton copain, c'est la vie.
Mais la façon dont ça s'est passé, moi je
crois que tu as raison de prendre ça à coeur.
J'imagine qu'on réagirait pareil.
Est-ce que tu veux savoir où il est ?
- Asseyons-nous et discutons, Frank.
- Faut que je voie mon fils.
Il a raison, Frank,
venez boire un café quelque part.
Pas maintenant, je dois aller me changer.
Sergueï et eux...
ils ont tué Mau Mau Willis.
- Pourquoi ils l'ont refroidi ?
- Il devait du fric au juif.
D'accord. Sergueï est un tueur.
Mais lui et Eton agissent pour un autre.
- Qui est au-dessus d'eux Mike ?
- J'en sais rien.
- T'en sais rien ?
- Je voulais pas le savoir.
Nom de Dieu, c'est les flics
qui t'ont fait ça, Ziggy ?
Non, c'est pas les flics.
La caution n'est pas gagnée d'après l'avocat.
Mais j'essaie.
Tu le sais bien que j'essaie.
- Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
- Je sais pas.
J'en ai eu assez.
Assez d'être la cible
de toutes les mauvaises blagues.
T'avais des problèmes, fallait venir me voir.
Fallait venir m'en parler.
T'aurais même pas entendu.
T'étais toujours trop occupé
à draguer le canal.
Pour vérifier que c'était le bon trou du cul
qui était élu.
Ou acheter une nouvelle clôture de jardin.
Je croyais toujours que tu passais
tout ce temps dehors à travailler.
Mais c'était vrai. Je travaillais, Ziggy.
C'était du travail tout ça.
Pour toi aussi. Pour ta mère.
Je parie que tu lui as même pas dit
que j'étais là, hein ?
Tu lui as peut-être dit.
Et elle a déjà avalé trois Nembutol
pour dormir toute la journée.
- Laisse-la loin de tout ça.
- Elle en est loin t'en fais pas.
Papa.
Quand j'ai vu ce que j'avais fait à ce garçon
allongé par terre dans le magasin
ça m'a rendu malade.
- C'est pas ton genre, Ziggy.
- Ah non ?
Parce que, parce qu'on n'est pas
du même sang, papa.
J'aimerais bien tu sais, mais c'est pas vrai.
Tu me ressembles plus que tu crois.
Tu es un Sobotka.
Baisé. C'est ça que je suis.
Baisé, ça on peut le dire.
C'est avec White Mike Mac
Ardle qu'on progresse le plus.
Il est au bord du précipice.
On fait intervenir Pearlman aujourd'hui
pour voir comment elle peut le faire tomber.
À part ça, on est toujours à la recherche
du neveu de Sobotka.
Herc et Carver s'en occupent.
Je me dis que ce sont les dealers,
ces voleurs, qui donneront Eton et Sergueï.
Le dossier est plus mince quand on passe à
Spiros Vondopoulos.
Putain les Grecs ont des noms
à coucher dehors.
Lâche les Grecs,
ils ont inventé la civilisation.
Ah bon ? Et l'enculage aussi, non ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on sait exactement
sur Vondopoulos ?
On devrait rester sur lui, voir qui il est.
Comment on fait ?
Vous nous filez une partie de votre équipe
de surveillance ?
Au cas où ça vous échapperait lieutenant,
je suis le seul agent Fédéral ici.
Le Procureur a ce qu'il voulait
avec les gars du syndicat.
Ce qui veut dire que ma mission...
se termine avec cette affaire.
OK, on se fera Vondopoulos tout seuls.
Je suis désolé pour lui.
Et pour toi.
On aurait dû faire plus attention
à nos enfants.
Comme si je pouvais empêcher Ziggy
de faire ce qu'il a fait
comme si on avait jamais pu le maîtriser.
Je pensais à mon fils aussi.
Ils vont lancer leurs filets
sur tout le monde.
Il y a toujours des trucs
qui se perdent dans les caisses.
Il n'a rien à craindre.
Ils ont retourné ma maison, Frank.
Ils se donnent pas tout ce mal quand il
manque deux caisses de vodka.
Ils m'ont fait signer un mandat.
Un genre de reçu pour ce qu'ils ont trouvé.
De l'héroïne, Frank. Dans cette maison.
Non, ça va pas. C'est impossible.
Je savais que Nick et Ziggy fauchaient des
trucs comme des caméras, mais pas ça.
Tu le savais ?
Et une fois que Nicky s'est habitué à
voler et à avoir plus d'argent,
qu'est-ce que tu croyais toi ?
Que d'un seul coup il allait s'arrêter ?
Voyons, Frank.
À partir du moment où il a connu ça,
c'est plus juste...
Ça n'a jamais été fait,
je veux dire, il savait.
Tout ce que j'ai fait, les caisses au port,
l'argent qu'on en a retiré,
c'était pour tenir le coup.
Mais bon sang, Frank !
Ça n'excuse pas une chose pareille. Ça non.
Oncle Frank, la providence.
"C'est cassé ? Donne-le à mon oncle.
"Il va le réparer."
Eh, le molosse,
j'ai quelque chose pour toi. Viens là.
T'as toujours pas le nouveau Harper's ?
Ben tu sais dans le quartier
ils ont pas grand-chose d'autre que Vibe
et Handguns Today.
Et quelques magazines de cul si t'as besoin.
Ça va. J'ai compris.
Je vais te trouver ça. D'accord ?
Eh, le chien. J'ai quelque chose pour toi.
Tiens... Voilà.
Oh, c'est un bon chien ça.
LOCAL 47 - BUREAU D'EMBAUCHE
ARRIVÉES - PORTS - DATE - HEURE
LE SUN - Les Feds ont le port à l'oeil.
Beau temps pour un bateau.
Ici c'est le bureau d'embauche, Frank.
Réservé aux dockers en service.
Big Roy, donne-moi ta carte.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux en faire ?
Pas toi. Little Big Roy. File-moi ta carte.
J'en ai besoin.
Je suis sur le Cap Saint George aujourd'hui.
- Je travaille à ta place.
- Tu travailles à ma place ?
Je vide le bateau avec ta carte.
Toi tu vides les bouteilles au bar.
T'es payé dans une semaine.
Eh, Phil.
Je me présente pour le Cap Saint George.
Je vois pas la ressemblance.
On est tous les deux chauves et polaks.
Il te faut encore autre chose ?
Qui veut travailler à ma place ?
- Lui, c'est pas le même style.
- C'est du Perry Ellis, on dirait.
Comment un pauvre type comme toi
qui a toujours l'air de tomber du lit
pourrait reconnaître un couturier ?
Ben comme ça, je devine.
C'est du Joseph Abboud.
Il met des boutons noirs plutôt qu'en cuivre
sur ses vestes.
C'est ça la marque de Abboud.
Tu sais comment on appelle un mac qui
prête autant d'attention à ses vêtements ?
Un adulte.
Top.
- Douze, quatorze, on y va.
- Reçu, onze trente-quatre.
- C'est une première.
- Un contrôleur qui sue.
- Tu y arrives ?
- Oui, oui.
Tu ferais mieux d'installer
un chevalet sur le trottoir
- et de faire une série de croquis.
- T'inquiète.
- Pas d'autres informations ?
- Si. Sers-toi de la ville.
Les vitrines, les miroirs,
tout ce qui reflète. Penses-y.
Reste sur ma fréquence, hein ?
Vondopoulos devrait sortir
du garage à pied...
- d'un instant à l'autre.
- Bien reçu.
Beadie Russell. Elle comptait pour rien
quand on a démarré.
Elle se défend maintenant.
Merci.
Douze, quatorze. Je l'ai vu entrer
dans une chambre au cinquième.
Note le numéro et redescend à la réception.
- Tu l'attends là.
- Reçu.
Elle a vu Vondopoulos dans une chambre.
Ça peut durer un moment.
Bien reçu.
- Tout ça va sur le châssis ?
- Ouais, c'est ce qu'on m'a dit.
On a presque fini.
Va chercher un chariot élévateur.
Douze, quatorze. Vondopoulos et un homme
d'âge moyen, costume bleu...
quittent l'hôtel par devant.
Ils sont derrière moi. Bien reçu ?
Bien reçu.
Onze, trente-quatre.
L'objectif et son compagnon, costume bleu,
vont partir d'un moment à l'autre.
Bien reçu. On fait gaffe.
Le mec avec Vondopoulos
doit être un ponte.
- T'as vu le prix du costume ?
- Ouais, vu tout ce qu'il a comme boutons.
On laisse la Benz ici ?
Elle est volée.
Ils ne sont pas revenus à la Mercedes.
Vous les voyez, vous ?
Négatif.
- T'as bientôt fini ?
- Il y a encore ces meufs-là à vider.
- C'est plus dur qu'on croit.
- Comme le reste.
- Tu sais pourquoi on l'appelle Moonshot ?
- Ouais ? Et j'en ai rien à foutre.
La chambre était réservée à quel nom ?
Euh, Stéphane Rados, avec une adresse à
Northwest dans la banlieue de Washington.
C'est peut-être le type qui a un bon tailleur.
Ou pas ?
On devrait enquêter sur l'identité de ce gars.
Voir ce qu'on trouve.
Quant au seul résultat tangible
de nos descentes de police...
que peut-on faire pour notre ami Mike ?
Il balance ses fournisseurs et il sort
en liberté surveillée.
- Et on peut l'éloigner si c'est nécessaire.
- Protection du témoin ?
À quoi bon avoir les Fédéraux avec vous
si ça ne fait pas avancer les choses ?
Attendez une seconde, vous allez faire
pareille faveur à un dealer ?
Et Frank Sobotka, alors ?
Les Fédéraux ont essayé, mais sans succès.
C'est ce qu'ils m'ont dit.
À ce que j'ai compris,
ils voulaient casser le syndicat...
Plus que tout dans cette enquête.
Si on en revenait plutôt à Frank ?
Vous ne pouvez lui faire
aucune proposition vous-même.
Il n'y a que moi qui puisse le faire,
avec l'accord du Procureur, en plus.
- Elle peut semer la graine.
- Il n'y a pas meilleure messagère, madame.
Faites un essai.
- Tu vas le voir chez lui ?
- Au Local du syndicat. C'est son chez-lui.
Merci d'avoir attendu Brucie. Désolé.
Je devrais même pas être vu avec toi
à ce point.
Je veux seulement régler
nos affaires alors qu'on peut.
Apparemment, je remettrai pas de sitôt
la main sur autant d'argent.
Frank, le quai aux grains c'est mort.
La moitié des voix qu'on s'était assurées
ont changé de camp.
Ils ont lu la presse, Frank.
Et alors, je suis une brebis galeuse ?
Le quai c'est toujours le quai aux grains.
Ils votent pas pour moi, Brucie,
il s'agit pas de moi.
Je veux pas te mentir.
Personne ne prendra notre parti
maintenant que tu as le FBI sur le dos.
- Ils ont peur.
- De quoi ?
Ils ont touché de l'argent, Frank.
S'ils donnent leurs voix, ils croient
que les Fédéraux vont leur tomber dessus.
Je suis désolé, Frank.
Écoute, tu te débrouilles pour en finir
avec le FBI,
et on reparlera du quai aux grains
à la prochaine séance.
T'auras bien un ou deux mecs là-dedans
qui sauront qu'ils te doivent une voix.
Sinon, je sais pas quoi te dire.
Je sais pas. Désolé, Frank.
Tu sais où il est le problème, Brucie ?
Dans ce pays, on a fait beaucoup de trucs.
Et bâti des tas de choses.
Maintenant on se contente de piquer dans la
poche du voisin.
Mange. Tu peux pas te nourrir d'olives.
Commande de l'agneau, par exemple.
J'ai pas très faim.
Tous ces problèmes.
- Alors, nos associés. Ils sont solides ?
- Oui.
Je ne m'inquiète pas pour les nôtres.
On peut les sortir avant le procès.
Sinon, ils nous couvriront.
Mais les xé-ni. Ils en ont trop vu.
Il n'y aura plus aucun problème.
Nous devons nous en assurer.
- Il y a peut-être un autre moyen.
- Il n'y en a qu'un de sûr.
Écoute-moi.
Si je peux garantir
que Frank Sobotka et son neveu...
ne diront rien...
Tu ne préférerais pas ça ?
Mais tu ne peux pas le garantir.
Le fils de Frank, l'imbécile qui a tué
George dans sa boutique...
doit rester en prison pour un bon moment.
Sauf que...
Il y avait un jeune vendeur
qui a été blessé ce jour-là.
Le parquet veut qu'il comparaisse
comme témoin.
Je connais sa famille.
Frank Sobotka récupèrera son fils.
Quand un homme peut obtenir ça,
pourquoi irait-il voir la police ?
Et pour le neveu de Frank ?
C'est le cousin de l'imbécile.
Il veut la même chose que Frank.
De toute façon, tu n'as pas à t'en faire Nico.
Tu as de l'affection pour lui, Spiros.
Tu aurais dû avoir un fils.
Mais dans ce cas j'aurais eu une femme.
Si cette larve n'est pas rentrée à minuit,
j'en ferai une affaire personnelle.
Cette enflure habite chez papa maman.
Pourquoi un gars comme ça
foutrait le camp ?
Tu te rappelles, on est venu avec Tosha ?
Viens. Comme c'est beau ici.
- Allez. Attends.
- C'est bien. Oui, mon toutou.
Alors beau mec. Où est la fiesta ?
Ah non les filles. Il n'y a pas de soirée.
Ah bon, on croyait que Donnell et les autres
venaient fumer un pétard.
Tu connais Donnell ?
C'est quoi ton nom, mon pépère ?
Hein, le pépère.
Comment ça va, aujourd'hui ?
T'as été gentil. Oh, c'est gentil pépère.
- Et voilà.
- À un de ces jours.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a Lamar ?
Inutile de prolonger.
Si on a le temps.
- Tu as tué Lamar ?
- Non, il se repose.
- T'as pas envie de savoir qui ?
- Pas particulièrement.
Il y a un an environ, un type appelé Brandon
a été tué à Baltimore.
Brûlé et battu avant de mourir.
- Les affaires sont les affaires.
- C'est sûr.
Mais c'était un beau mec, tu vois.
Vous n'aviez pas besoin de lui faire tout ça.
Tu comprends ?
- Tu dis il y a un an ?
- À peu près.
Tes informations sont mauvaises.
Tu mens pour sauver ta vie.
Je suis en paix avec mon Dieu.
Fais ce que tu veux.
Alors tu as compris ?
Ce qui est arrivé à ton copain,
ce n'est pas mon style.
Vu la façon dont tu saignes du dos,
on dirait que la balle a traversé proprement.
Ce sont les effets du 9 mm à courte portée.
Les urgences.
Pour la police ou l'ambulance ?
Je vous signale un blessé par balle
au New Motel.
- North Avenue. Chambre 221.
- Monsieur ?
Ma copine Beatrice.
Vous allez encore m'embarquer ?
J'ai gagné le droit d'y revenir encore, non ?
Arrêtez. Arrêtez, ça suffit.
- Parlez-moi.
- Pour dire quoi ?
Je suis assis là pour tâcher de comprendre.
C'est pas arrivé du jour au lendemain.
Je savais que j'avais tort.
Mais dans ma tête, j'avais tort
pour de bonnes raisons. Vous voyez ?
Il y a plusieurs façons d'avoir tort.
Qu'est-ce que vous faites là, Bea ?
Allez donc à la police. Sans les menottes.
Mais de votre propre gré.
Je vous tends une perche, Frank.
Je ne peux rien vous promettre.
Mais venez nous voir. Ce sera un départ.
Vous valez mieux que vos fréquentations.
- Notre Vondopoulos n'est pas rentré ?
- Peut-être qu'il s'est fait étendre.
Ce qui est pas notre cas.
Tu crois qu'il a largué la Benz
parce qu'il a repéré la filature ?
Nicky, des docks.
Si vous aviez pas appelé hier,
je vous aurais pas retrouvé.
Relax, Nico, allez.
C'est ce que j'ai dit au téléphone.
Ça va très bien se passer.
On fera ce qui faut pour.
J'aurais jamais dû marcher
avec des gens comme vous.
Oh mais non.
T'as essayé de faire quelque chose de toi.
Il n'y a pas de mal à ça.
Et tu as toujours tes amis.
Je suis foutu.
Mon oncle aussi sans parler du syndicat.
Et de Ziggy ?
- Bon Dieu !
- Pour lui aussi, on sera des amis.
Vous pouvez rien faire pour ça.
Ziggy est mort.
Rien n'est jamais mort, Nico. Rien.
Regarde.
JANOS KAVATZ - Budapest, Hongrie
UTLEVEL - PASSEPORT
Ce n'est pas votre nom.
Beaucoup de noms et de passeports.
On peut faire beaucoup de choses.
Vous pouvez faire quoi pour Ziggy ?
On demande que de la loyauté.
Pourquoi ils ont des crosses ?
Ils peuvent pas taper avec leurs pieds ?
Elle m'a demandé carrément
de me livrer. Alors me voilà.
Tout d'abord, il faut que nous sachions
ce que vous attendez.
Nous ne voulons pas
de malentendu ultérieurement.
Je cherche à... ce que je voudrais,
euh vous voyez... je voudrais aider mon fils.
- Il peut pas rester dans cette prison-là.
- Il ira dans un établissement du Comté.
- Et pour mon neveu ?
- Il sera arrêté et mis en accusation.
Mais contre sa coopération et la vôtre...
on se contentera de la liberté surveillée.
Mais ce que nous pouvons ou non faire
pour votre famille...
- dépend de votre degré de coopération.
- De ce que je balance vous voulez dire ?
J'en sais assez sur tout le monde.
Sur moi aussi, je vous dirai tout.
Mais rien sur le syndicat.
Je mouillerai pas les gars du syndicat.
Je vous dirai tout sur les filles mortes.
Je vous donnerai le Grec
et tous les fils de pute.
Je dirai tout ce que j'ai sur le coeur
juste pour mon fils et mon neveu.
M. Sobotka, à ce stade, je dois vous aviser...
que vous aurez besoin
des services d'un avocat.
On le fait pas maintenant ?
Il faut que votre avocat soit ici avec nous.
S'il est là, on peut commencer dès demain
à la première heure.
Monsieur Sobotka, j'ai une question.
Pourquoi cesser d'utiliser votre portable ?
Vous l'aviez repéré. Je le savais, eh oui.
Sous le pont, hein ?
Ça se passera en plein air.
Les flics pourront pas installer des écoutes.
Ces gars protègent une grosse organisation.
C'est au niveau mondial.
- Ah, c'est pas n'importe qui ces gars-là ?
- Non, t'as pas idée.
Je crois que j'ai une idée assez précise
de ce qu'ils trafiquent.
C'est pas une bande de rigolos
qui roulent des tonneaux d'huile sur le quai.
Héroïne ?
Comment on en est arrivé là, Nick ?
Regarde-moi !
T'es presque un gamin encore.
Moi, j'aurais dû le savoir.
Je t'ai présenté à eux pour quel résultat ?
J'ai ruiné ma putain de famille, pour quoi ?
Tu sais ce que c'est ça, Nicky ? Tu le sais ?
Un complexe industriel.
Non, j'irai pas les voir.
Moi ce que je vais faire
c'est que je vais parler à la police.
Exactement. Je vais faire
à ces enculés ce qu'ils m'ont fait à moi.
- Tu peux pas faire ça.
- Et pourquoi ?
Ils veulent nous voir à propos de Ziggy.
Ils peuvent influencer le témoin.
Le jeune sur qui il a tiré,
celui qui était dans la boutique.
Il va dire que c'est Double G
qui tenait l'arme.
Que c'était un genre de légitime défense.
Ziggy pourra être libre, Frank.
C'est sûr.
- Qu'est-ce qu'ils veulent en échange ?
- La loyauté.
Les fumiers !
Je les écouterai.
- D'accord. Je vais te conduire.
- Non, j'y vais seul.
Tu n'auras plus jamais affaire à eux.
- Oncle Frank, Spiros et moi...
- Je veux pas que tu viennes avec moi !
Rentre !
Formulaire 302 Transmission par fax crypté
De TERRENCE FITZHUGH - 6l24l03
Objet : Audition de proposition
de Sobotka, Frank
Envoyé
Sobotka dit connaître l'organisation
y compris son chef qu'il nomme "Le Grec".
Il lie "Le Grec" aux filles mortes.
Audition repoussée jusqu'au choix
d'un avocat par Sobotka.
Ta manière...
Ça ne marchera pas
Il est exactement huit heures zéro cinq.
Quelques nuages, petite brise
mais chaud avec un maximum de 26 degrés.
Le soleil brille sur Baltimore.
Voici un de mes classiques du matin.
Yo Ott ! Le Santo Rey est en retard, hein ?
Il y a eu un coup de vent hier soir à
Hampton Roads.
DÉFENSE DE PASSER - QUAI FERMÉ
Soixante-seize, soixante-douze.
J'écoute soixante-seize, soixante-douze.
Signalez un homicide à la Criminelle.
On a un corps au Terminal Patapsco.
Bien reçu.
SUR ÉCOUTE
"Les affaires. Toujours les affaires."
- Le Grec
Rien trouvé chez Vondopoulos ?
Il reviendra pas.
Il a laissé la voiture et notre GPS dans un
garage du centre ville.
Il n'utilise plus de portable.
Et il n'y a plus de message
en grec non plus.
Les descentes, la filature
l'ont peut-être forcé à se cacher.
Et ce gars-là, Stephen Rados, c'est qui ?
Il a loué la chambre pour sa
rencontre avec Vondopoulos,
mais il est parti après.
Fitzhugh le traque dans chaque
base de données.
On n'a que son permis de conduire de DC.
Lester ? La Criminelle pour toi, ligne deux.
Peut-être que Sobotka le connaît.
Quand Sobotka viendra aujourd'hui,
peut-être qu'il dira comment trouver les Grecs.
Freamon, j'écoute.
J'en ai environ treize là, faxés par le VICAP.
Ce sont tous des corps anonymes.
Sans tête, sans main et venant de nulle part.
Si tu cherche bien,
tu dépasseras les quatre douzaines.
- Putain de merde.
- Que dire, hein fiston ?
On est la police d'une nation immorale.
Alors, tu viens les chercher ?
Ou je les envoie dans le secteur Sud-Est ?
- Envoie-les-moi dans le Sud-Est.
- Entendu.
- Mais asseyez-vous.
- Non, désolé.
Je ne peux pas rester,
je dois veiller sur le business.
Je voulais juste voir
si l'on s'occupait bien de vous.
Dans l'ensemble, c'est correct.
Au moins, je rattrape mon retard côté lecture.
Je voulais que vous sachiez que cette
affaire, on la mettra au clair.
Qui que ce soit, on le coincera.
On se charge de tout, vous pigez ?
J'apprécie le geste, mais ça ne sera
pas nécessaire.
Informez M. Barksdale que les obligations
qu'il pourrait s'être créées
vis-à-vis de cet incident
sont annulées de même que notre accord.
Ce que je voulais dire...
J'ai bien compris ce que vous vouliez dire.
Ce que moi je dis, c'est que je me
chargerai d'eux très bien sans votre aide.
Eux ?
De qui il s'agissait ?
Je vous remercie de votre visite.
Du calme, Nick. Du calme.
Je vais les tuer.
Putains d'enfoirés de Grecs !
Laissez-moi passer !
Lâchez-moi ! Allez vous faire foutre !
Il était toujours là pour vous et vous
vous êtes pas là pour lui.
Et qu'est-ce que tu veux faire ?
Prendre un flingue ? Jouer au gangster ?
Comme ton crétin de cousin ?
Allons-y !
Qu'est-ce qu'elle a pris ?
De la bombe à neurones bien arrosée.
Merde ! La bombe, c'est une bombe !
C'est une bonne occase, ça. Tu surveilles.
Putain, il volait dans l'ambulance, le mec !
Heureusement que tu surveillais, Johnny !
Je vous aurais appelé en tout cas.
Poignardé. Plusieurs fois.
Torse. Abdomen.
Puis ils lui ont coupé la gorge, par sécurité.
Une lame à un seul tranchant. Il s'est battu.
Il a des blessures de défense aux mains.
Des traces de corde aux deux jambes.
Ils l'avaient lesté avec quelque chose,
mais ça s'est détaché tout seul.
Un, deux, trois.
Putain ce jeune Sobotka, il le sait
qu'il y a un mandat contre lui,
qu'il vienne de lui-même ou qu'on
l'arrête, on s'en fout, non ?
Non, soit on le retrouve et on l'embarque,
soit il vient avec son avocat.
S'il se ramène avec un avocat, il y a moins
de chance qu'il soit coopératif.
Tu causes comme Mac Nulty, là.
Si on reste avec ces gars sur leurs
enquêtes, nous, on nous respectera jamais.
Toi et moi, on le sait.
Je pense que quand le détachement sera
renvoyé, je retournerai aux Stups.
J'essayerai d'entrer au service de Dawson,
de trouver un nouveau boss.
Et toi ?
J'en sais rien.
Je sais pas, faut admettre que Daniels
a été correct avec nous.
Au moins, il est là pour ses troupes.
- Vous vous foutez de moi.
- J'arrive du lieu du crime.
Il avait décidé de coopérer.
Il nous donnait ses réseaux de prostitution
et de drogue.
À se coucher avec des gangsters,
on se réveille avec la gorge tranchée.
Je me sens presque triste pour cet enfoiré.
Vous, vous aviez raison pour Sobotka.
Cette affaire avait assez de poids
pour que Burrell s'engage
à maintenir mon équipe ensemble
et indépendante de la Criminelle.
Si vous vouliez l'inculper...
Mais je vais l'inculper ce pauvre trou du cul.
Vous allez vous faire votre gendre ?
Qu'est-ce que vous croyez, je lui avais
dit de pas épouser ce fils de pute écervelé.
Je vais vous dire la vérité, commandant.
Ceux qui ont vu le coup de poing l'ont écrit.
Ils ont tous vu Prez vous le donner,
ça ne fait pas de doute.
Mais ils déclarent que vous avez
traité un officier subalterne de...
De quoi déjà ? D'enflure ?
Allez vous faire foutre.
C'est le Département de police de Baltimore,
pas le salon de la Reine d'Angleterre.
Ce que je veux dire c'est que les
autres flics et les agents du FBI
devront le décrire tel que ça s'est passé.
Je pourrais sûrement demander à mes
hommes de tricher pour vous, mais le FBI...
Vous les connaissez, ces culs serrés.
Roland Pryzbylewski va gérer le
service de nuit de l'accueil
du secteur Sud-Est pendant deux mois.
Au cours de ce temps, il enverra
une lettre d'excuse personnalisée
à ceux qui étaient là et qui l'ont vu frapper.
Lettre qui établira clairement
que c'était le coup de poing
d'un petit enculé
qui méritait de se faire botter le cul
ce qui a été évité, car ma fille
a des sentiments dont je tiens compte.
Il pourra ensuite me faire en direct,
les mêmes excuses.
Tout ça réglé, s'il a envie de foutre
en l'air sa carrière dans votre unité,
qu'il le fasse, j'en aurais rien à secouer.
Lieutenant.
Rodney, ce truc se met dans un supplément.
- Mets aucun témoignage au dossier public.
- Sergent.
Vous n'avez rien pour Freamon ?
La Criminelle a dû vous l'envoyer.
Sergent, mon fils vient se rendre,
il a un mandat d'arrêt contre lui.
Tout le monde cause et personne n'écoute.
Mike, si ce connard rappelle,
je suis aux chiottes.
- Allons-y, je vous écoute, messieurs.
- Vous avez un mandat contre moi.
- Je suis là pour me livrer.
- Un mandant du Sud-Est ?
Il se rend.
Il est prêt à coopérer autant que possible.
- Quel nom faut que je cherche ?
- Sobotka. Nicholas Sobotka.
SALLE D'INTERROGATOIRE
De la morphine ? Dans une ambulance ?
Tu devrais avoir honte de m'appeler pour ça.
- Le corps est remonté.
- J'ai vu à la télévision.
On l'avait lesté copieusement
mais avec l'eau ça n'a pas tenu longtemps.
Manque de chance, c'est tout.
Sergeï s'y serait mieux pris, je l'admets.
Niko, le neveu. Maintenant, il est au courant.
Nos hommes l'attendent
mais la police aussi.
Je pense,
que nous ne pouvons rien faire maintenant.
Il dira ce qu'il dira.
Il connaît mon nom, mais mon nom
n'est pas mon nom.
Alors et toi ?
Pour eux, tu es simplement "Le Grec".
Et bien sûr je ne suis même pas grec.
Donc on s'en va.
Mais on a un dernier détail à régler avant.
Une cargaison accoste cette semaine.
- On a cent cinquante kilos.
- Et on a personne pour les ramasser.
Sergeï me manque. Et Frank aussi.
On peut pas avoir ce container.
Mais on peut envoyer quelqu'un.
Le ramasser de façon légale.
Où qu'on aille ces jours-ci,
apparemment on tombe sur la police.
Et ça, ça veut dire quelque chose.
Tu vas laisser quinze millions de
Thollaria pourrir sur le port.
L'agneau marche vers l'abattoir,
l'homme apprend à fuir quand il le faut.
Alors, on s'en va.
Téléphone aux autres.
Explique-leur que l'opération est terminée.
On n'attend pas ?
Nos amis sont toujours là, non ?
- Toujours là.
- Alors partez.
Sobotka était prêt à coopérer ?
On a eu un entretien préliminaire
avec lui, hier.
Il devait déposer
devant avocat, au lieu de quoi...
Alors, que reste-t-il de l'enquête ?
On a embarqué tous ceux qu'on avait
sur écoute, à part deux d'entre eux.
Nous avons laissé aller le numéro deux
en espérant qu'il nous mène au numéro un.
Il est sous surveillance ?
On l'a perdu pour le moment.
La dernière fois, il quittait un hôtel en ville,
mais on pense qu'il refera surface.
Et côté syndicat ?
Sobotka étant mort, l'affaire ne touche
plus qu'un subordonné ou deux.
Ce qui est important, c'est le syndicat.
Soit ils larguent leurs dirigeants actuels,
soit on rend illégal ce local.
Il reste que moi et mes 14 petits cadavres.
Quand songerons-nous enfin à cet aspect ?
Lieutenant Daniels ? Ligne 2. Inspecteur
Freamon, c'est vraiment important.
Il est certain que Frank Sobotka
nous aurait parlé à ce sujet.
On fait un pas en arrière, j'en suis désolée.
- Nick Sobotka vient de se rendre.
- Le neveu ?
Ouais. Il a changé de camp.
Allez, Bubs, tu dois faire mieux,
si tu veux être vite dehors.
- T'as rien sur des meurtres ?
- Non, pourquoi ?
Quoi, on tue plus personne
à Baltimore Ouest maintenant ?
C'est plutôt tranquille.
À part le merdier avec ce garçon
touché par une balle
perdue à travers la fenêtre, il se passe rien.
- Que sais-tu de ça ?
- J'ai rien à voir là-dedans.
C'était 2 gangs se disputant un territoire.
Tu sais quoi, Bubs ? Tu vas aller en taule.
Comment ça, tu veux m'envoyer en taule ?
Tu l'as entendue, Johnny ?
Comme si ça comptait pas ici,
comme si on n'était pas amis, ni rien.
Tu sais, quand t'étais à l'hosto,
j'ai fait que m'inquiéter.
"Où est Kima ? Comment va mon amie ?"
Moi, je suis content de te voir repartie à fond.
Et toi, tu me parles de prison ?
Merde, cocotte, t'es trop dure, là.
Tu te rappelles ce gars de rue
abattu dans la haute ?
Tu te souviens ?
Déconne pas, t'étais pile là, Bubbles.
C'était que dalle,
la balle était en plastique, c'est tout.
- De quoi vous parlez ?
- Il s'appelait Cheese.
Avec des gars de l'Est, il est
venu vendre dans le coin de Terrace.
Ils ont piqué deux tours
aux mecs de Stringer Bell.
Puis un cinglé avec un noeud pap
les a renvoyés chez eux.
Ils sont tous partis ?
Le noeud pap leur a fait foutre le camp.
Et il a dit à ces crétins de l'Est :
"Ces tours sont à Avon."
Mais il est plus revenu.
Maintenant les gars de l'Est
ont repris la place.
Je sais pas, c'est pas une vraie guerre,
ni rien.
Stringer et eux ont fait un partage.
Ce serait un accord ?
Vous avez toute la famille là, on dirait.
Vous avez un avocat de l'assistance
judiciaire à vos côtés, M. Sobotka.
S'il y a quelque chose
que vous ne comprenez pas...
Ils ont tué mon oncle.
Vous êtes les seuls gens
avec qui je veux parler.
Comment vous savez que ce sont eux ?
J'ai dit...
Spiros m'a téléphoné
après que tout le monde se soit fait arrêter.
Il m'a dit qu'il comptait sur nous
pour bien se la fermer
mais oncle Frank, il voulait pas se taire.
Il a dit qu'il irait voir la police.
Spiros a dit que si on restait peinards,
ils aideraient mon cousin Zig. Vous pigez ?
Et là, Spiros il a dit que,
vous savez, que le jeune,
celui qui s'en est sorti
celui qui a été blessé
il dirait que le flingue n'était pas à Zig.
Que c'était Glekas qui avait sorti le flingue
que c'était pas la faute de Zig.
Alors ton oncle est allé les voir
pour parler de ça ?
Sous le Key Bridge.
J'ai vu que sa voiture y était encore,
ce matin.
Je l'ai vue et putain, j'ai su.
S'ils ont tué votre oncle,
ils vont probablement...
Vouloir aussi me descendre ?
Quelle connerie !
Je voulais aller avec lui sous le pont.
Je voulais aller les voir avec lui,
mais il a refusé...
Vous étiez impliqué dans la contrebande ?
On sait rien pour les filles.
Les filles qu'on a retrouvées ?
- On savait rien d'elles.
- Vous pensiez que c'était de la drogue ?
De la drogue, des trucs volés ou autre chose.
On était payés pour que des conteneurs
disparaissent des quais. Et c'est tout.
Il y avait ça et la vente de la drogue
que te refilait le Grec, t'es d'accord ?
C'est la déposition signée de ton cousin.
Il s'accuse lui-même.
Il a dit qu'il avait acheté le flingue.
La facture du prêteur sur gages
est aussi là-dedans.
Tu vois, ça aurait rien changé si la seconde
victime avait donné une autre version.
Ton cousin était coincé.
Hier, ton oncle était assis à la place
où tu es assis maintenant...
Prêt à tout nous donner pour qu'on
oublie ton inculpation pour trafic de drogue.
Et pour que ton cousin ait mieux
que la prison d'Eager Street.
Comme vous le voyez, nous sommes
désireux d'honorer cet accord
malgré la disparition de votre oncle.
Spiros était le donneur d'ordres.
Il disait à moi et Frank quels
conteneurs faire disparaître.
Quand j'en suis venu à la vente de drogue,
c'est aussi lui qui m'a branché.
L'Israélien, c'était le spécialiste de la dope.
C'était mon fournisseur...
Jusqu'à ce que je sois branché
sur White Mc Ardle. Vous connaissez Mike ?
DROGUE - ARRESTATION
"WHITE MIKE" Mc ARDLE
Évidemment.
Double G se chargeait des trucs volés.
Tout ce qu'on tirait sur les quais
allait droit dans ses réserves.
Mais il est mort. Je vais pas vous gâcher
votre temps, pas vrai ?
Elle, je la connais pas.
ILONA PETROVNA - ARRÊTÉE
Sur mon oncle, vous savez tout.
Je sais pas pourquoi il y a la photo
de Horseface là-dedans.
Horseface, il sait rien.
Je suis prêt à le jurer.
Qu'est-ce que tu sais du Russe ?
Il conduisait, lui.
Pour tout ce qui devait disparaître des docks,
c'était leur homme.
Mais j'ai l'impression que quand ils
devaient, disons, blesser quelqu'un...
Il était aussi avec eux pour faire cette
part de travail.
Pourquoi dites-vous ça ?
Sergeï, c'est l'effet qu'il faisait,
son attitude.
Il y a aussi qu'après la mort des filles
dans le conteneur,
ils m'ont expliqué que celui qui avait foiré...
Ils l'avaient déjà coincé à Philadelphie.
Ils ont dit que qui que ce soit
qui avait fait ça aux filles était mort.
Comment ils ont dit ça ?
Ils ont juste dit, j'en sais rien
que le gars que vous cherchiez
c'était devenu une voie sans issue.
- Sans issue ?
- Ouais.
À Philadelphie, ils ont dit.
C'est qui le costard ?
T'en es sûr ?
On sait qu'il y a encore un homme
au-dessus de ton mec, Spiros.
Quelqu'un avec qui il communiquait.
Ouais, le Grec.
Sûr. Je sais de qui vous parlez.
Mais moi, j'ai aucun nom, ni rien.
L'homme en costard,
l'homme avec Vondopoulos sur la photo,
ce n'est pas le Grec ?
Lui, c'est le Grec. Là.
À gauche, là ?
C'est bien un gars des quartiers Est
qu'il a désigné.
Cheese roule pour Proposition Joe
et sa bande.
J'ai entendu dire qu'il dealait
du côté d'Ashland.
- Alors, le verdict ?
- Il nous a refilé un tuyau.
- Donc je le sors de mes stats ?
- Je te le revaudrai, Santi.
- Ouais ! Les deux ?
- Ouais, lui, c'est son valet.
Je peux utiliser vos toilettes ?
Tu rêves ou quoi ? Fous le camp !
Bubs, une dernière question.
Comment est la dope dans les tours ?
Elle était à chier et maintenant ça va.
FILLES ASSASSINÉES - PROSTITUTION
J'ai trouvé le type.
Terminal de la cour Fédérale à Washington.
Mais pas dans le mauvais fichier.
Ce gars est un avocat.
Le costard était seulement un costard ?
D'un autre côté, mon ami,
ceci nous vient d'outre-Atlantique,
un conteneur de l'Adriatica, qui sera
débarqué après-demain à Patapsco.
Avec un faux manifeste venu du Havre.
J'imagine que vous allez le saisir ?
Ouais, c'est pour 300 mille dollars
de travail qu'on a là.
Et pour lui, on fait quoi ?
Tu vas appeler le ministère de la Justice
pour sa protection.
On est parti prendre sa femme et son enfant.
Vaut mieux être un maximum discret.
On s'est déjà fait descendre un témoin.
C'est pour toi.
Daniels.
Lieutenant. Fitzhugh veut une protection,
on récupère la copine et le gosse.
D'accord. Merci.
FBl.
Je suis l'agent spécial Terrance Fitzhugh,
du bureau de Baltimore.
- J'aimerais avoir l'agent Koutris, SVP.
- Qui ?
L'agent Koutris.
Il ne fait plus partie
du bureau de San Diego.
Où est-ce qu'il est ?
Essayez au Quartier Général à Washington.
Anti-terrorisme.
L'anti-terrorisme et depuis quand ?
Je peux le vérifier, mais je suis sûre
qu'il est parti depuis plus d'un an.
Ou il se pointe chez lui d'ici cinq
minutes ou je bouffe mon flingue.
Moi, je dis que c'est pas comme ça
qu'on fait les choses à Baltimore Ouest.
Même qu'on est très loin du compte !
Soit votre fils se rend d'ici une heure,
soit les flics du district débarqueront
2 fois par jour
jusqu'à ce que le message passe.
T'entends, mon vieux ?
On va venir ici chez vous, matins et soirs,
et on va retourner votre maison
jusqu'à ce qu'il y ait plus un meuble
sur pattes, c'est pigé ?
Sergent, mon fils est allé se livrer
à la police hier soir.
District Sud-Est.
Il y avait un inspecteur qui était là.
INSPECTEUR LESTER FREAMON
BRIGADE CRIMINELLE
- Un inspecteur ?
- L'enfoiré ! Viens !
N'utilisez pas le téléphone.
Un agent sera posté à l'extérieur.
Si vous allez quelque part, allez-y avec lui.
C'est un trou à rats.
Tu voulais qu'on ait un endroit
à nous, non ?
S'ils l'ont coincé à Philadelphie,
ils ont probablement balancé
le corps dans le secteur.
Ça sert à rien de traîner sur des kilomètres
le corps décapité d'un gars.
Nom de Dieu !
Je parie qu'en ce moment, quelque part,
un flic regarde une table couverte de têtes.
Dans les affaires saisies sur le bateau,
est-ce qu'il y avait des photos ?
On a deux ou trois clichés d'un gars
qui a laissé son sac.
Elles sont aux pièces à conviction.
Vous devriez partir tous les deux.
Sinon les bureaux seront déjà fermés.
Vous étiez passés où, vous ?
Ce que je te dis, Butchie,
c'est qu'un truc clochait.
Le type captait rien à ce que je disais.
Alors j'ai lâché l'affaire.
- Tu crois que Mouzone m'a embobiné ?
- Non.
Tu sais lire le mensonge dans les yeux
après toutes ces années.
Sinon, je parlerais à un gars déjà mort.
Tu as dit que Stringer t'avait dit que
Mouzone était mêlé à la mort
de ton pote, Brandon ?
Ouais.
À ce que je sais, Mouzone est presque
tout le temps là-bas, dans le Nord.
À New York ou Philadelphie.
Si Avon l'avait engagé pour nous descendre
il serait pas revenu avant que vous soyez
tous les deux refroidis.
C'est ma faute,
j'aurais dû dire non à Proposition Joe
tout de suite.
Le père d'Avon était une pourriture finie
et le fils n'est pas mieux.
Stringer aussi faut le mettre sur la liste.
Il va le payer très cher, Stringer.
Je gaspillerais ma salive pour
te faire changer d'avis, je suppose.
T'es mon banquier depuis des lustres
et tu me demandes encore ça ?
Et tu comptes l'avoir comment ?
J'en sais rien du tout, Butch.
Mais je vais prendre mon temps et réfléchir.
Une chose est sûre en tout cas,
ce mec, il doit pas survivre, tu piges ?
Qu'est-ce que tu vois, Butchie ?
Trop de choses, petit.
Oui, j'en vois beaucoup trop.
Un tas de choses est arrivé hier soir.
Pour nous, non.
- Ça n'a rien de personnel.
- C'est pas juste !
On n'est pas des hommes pour vous.
On est des foutues mules.
"Surveillez ce hangar,
transportez ce mec, attendez celui-là."
Ça fait partie du job.
Dans ce boulot, il y avait un peu d'action,
aussi, si je me souviens bien.
Ces enquêtes vont plus loin.
On met en taule grâce à l'écoute
téléphonique et l'ordinateur.
Et nous alors, on n'a pas le niveau.
Le commandant Colvin recherche un
sergent pour le secteur Ouest.
Brigade volante.
D'après moi, j'ai les galons qu'il faut.
Est, Ouest.
Chiens et chats qui dorment ensemble.
Merde. J'ai un truc à faire, je suis en retard.
PORT DE PHILADELPHIE
ZONE D'ACCÈS LIMITE
Vous voulez toutes les personnes qui
sont venues sur le port ce jour-là ?
Non, on cherche ce qui est arrivé
sortant de l'ordinaire. De nuit.
Qui sort de l'ordinaire. Vous auriez dû le dire.
- Tout à l'heure, vous avez demandé...
- Non, c'est ce qu'on...
Vous avez raison, monsieur.
Regardez donc s'il y a eu un truc inhabituel.
Rien. Rien qui sorte de la routine.
D'accord. Pourriez-vous nous donner le nom
du vigile qui surveillait cette nuit-là ?
C'était quelle date déjà ?
C'était le cinq février.
Vous aviez l'Atlantic Light amarré à ce quai,
à partir de 18 heures.
C'était Walt. Walt Stokes.
Est-ce qu'il travaille ce soir ?
On est mardi. Walt est en congé le mardi.
Vous voulez quoi à Walt ?
On voudrait savoir s'il en reconnaît un.
Vous risquez de perdre votre temps.
Walt a l'esprit un peu moins vif
que nous autres.
Vu que vous vous êtes déplacés jusqu'ici,
vous aurez peut-être envie de jeter un oeil
aux vidéos.
Trois cents dollars pour une poussette ?
Ouais, je sais.
C'est plus cher que ta première voiture.
Ça te fait tout drôle, on dirait.
Vraiment, il faut qu'on en ait une !
Regarde ça, Kima.
Un étui pour les packs de jus de fruit.
Si le gosse ne tient pas son jus de fruit sans
ce machin-là, on est franchement mal barré.
Alors écoute.
Ce bébé va sortir de mon ventre et il aura
besoin de nous deux. Toute sa vie.
Tu comprends ?
Et peut-être que c'est pas réel pour toi.
Mais je te jure que c'est très réel pour moi.
Nick. Nicky.
Qu'est-ce qui va se passer, Nicky ?
Le conteneur sur le Cinq-Roues, là ?
Il est chaud, mais ils ont
envoyé personne pour le récupérer.
- D'où est-ce qu'il vient ?
- Le Havre, France.
Ils font chier, lourde-le.
CONTAINER - ENVOYÉ
Lester. Les conversations des mecs de Prop
Joe sur la ligne de l'entrepôt
avant qu'ils la laissent choir,
ça concernait le réapprovisionnement ?
On n'a pas gardé cette écoute longtemps,
tout au plus, trois semaines.
- Quelles quantités ?
- 5 ou 6 fauteuils relax à la fois, au début.
Au dernier appel sur le cell d'Eton,
la commande était passée à douze.
Il a fait monter sa commande à douze kilos ?
Voilà, il est là.
Mais il se passe rien de louche.
Chef d'unité, surveillez ce conteneur.
Bien reçu.
Allez. Je suis désolé pour mon pote, Sergeï.
Pour Eton aussi.
Vous avez perdu des mecs bien.
Il va y avoir de nouveaux visages.
Dans une semaine ou deux. Ils te trouveront.
Comme ils trouveront les autres
qui travaillent avec nous.
Une semaine ?
Vu ce que j'ai en stock, je tiendrai
à peine plus d'une semaine.
Vous avez rien à refiler
avant de vous en aller ?
Le dernier chargement a été perdu.
Perdu ? Comment ça ?
La police a peut-être déjà le nez dessus.
T'en es sûr ou non ?
Il y en a plein là d'où il vient.
Et il y en aura toujours plus.
Alors d'accord.
Je laisserai ta nouvelle équipe venir à moi.
Fais bon voyage, l'ami.
Où est-ce que tu dois aller déjà ?
Il y en a douze là, quinze dans celui-là,
et si les autres cartons sont sur le même
modèle, ça fait...
Peut-être 200 kilos de brut
abandonnés sur les docks.
Les Grecs sont partis dans la nature.
Et nous, on est vraiment dans le noir.
On fait quoi, on envoie
une note aux Douanes ?
Non, remettez des plombs et surveillez-le.
Si on a de la chance,
quelqu'un viendra le chercher.
Vous êtes si chanceux ?
S'ils nous avaient pas découverts,
on se payait un super coup de filet.
C'est à vous de jouer.
Une embuscade ? Dans sa propre chambre ?
Ouais. Il va s'en remettre bien, mais il...
J'en ai vraiment rien à battre
qu'il s'en remette, mon vieux.
Si tu payes un talent étranger à ce prix-là,
c'est pour que le putain de boulot
soit bien fait !
Non, il a dit que le contrat entre nous était...
C'était quoi le mot déjà ? Annulé.
Annulé ? Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire, hein ?
Mouzone reparti d'ici,
notre cas sera pire qu'avant son arrivée.
Et si la nouvelle circule
qu'on est aussi faibles que ça,
comment on va pouvoir
tenir notre territoire ?
Je sais, faut réagir vite et fort.
Faut faire un exemple.
Mais Mouzone refuse de dire qui a fait ça.
- Tu lui as demandé qui c'était ?
- Ouais.
- Pourquoi ?
- Pourquoi, quoi ?
Comment t'as pu poser une question
pareille à un type comme Mouzone ?
Soit il dit quelque chose,
soit il dit rien et il s'arrange.
Dans tous les cas,
valait mieux que tu lui demandes rien.
Avon, tous les business basés sur un
marché sont cycliques...
Et là, on est dans un cycle négatif.
String, là, t'es pas dans un des cours
d'économie que tu suis, tu saisis ?
Je te cause pas de cette partie-là.
Je te cause d'une autre chose.
La rue, c'est la rue, toujours.
Avon, on va se sortir de ce merdier,
de toute façon.
Il n'y a aucun doute. Tiens le coup
jusqu'à ce que je sois libéré.
Ce jour arrivera, mais en attendant
faut qu'on fasse ce qu'on peut faire,
là où on peut le faire.
Alors t'iras voir Prop Joe.
Et là, je suis d'accord avec toi.
T'organises le truc comme tu le sens.
C'est toi qui gères, jusqu'à mon retour.
Ça roule.
À nous, mec.
À nous.
- Merde, la cassette est foutue.
- C'est un multiplex.
C'est plus économique.
Au lieu d'une caméra, d'un magnétoscope,
on utilise dix caméras et un seul magnéto.
- Ça donne quelque chose ?
- Oui, grâce à ce logiciel.
- Suffit de dé-plexer l'image.
- Dé-plexer ?
Je vous montre la bande numéro un.
- C'est un insigne qu'il sort ?
- On le dirait bien.
C'est quelque chose qu'on voit pas souvent.
Un flic dans une Mercedes-Benz.
Ça pourrait bien être notre client.
Quand il avait encore sa tête.
Dites-moi qu'il y a des caméras à l'intérieur.
Seigneur, j'en mouille mon slip.
Allez, mon joli !
Ouais !
Le réapprovisionnement aura
une semaine de retard.
Mes amis sont en train de réorganiser
un peu leur truc.
Une semaine ?
Pas plus, c'est ce qu'ils ont dit.
Ça a donné quoi avec Avon aujourd'hui ?
Ça roule.
Notre vieux pote.
Dirigeant du syndicat inculpé retrouvé mort
C'est quoi, les nouvelles ?
Les flics du port sont sur un
conteneur débarqué de l'Adriatica.
À la douane, on dit que c'est plein de dope.
Je voulais parler de Frank.
- Que dit le conseil du district ?
- Messieurs ?
Monsieur Pakusa. Étant donné
votre mise en examen,
je pensais que vous seriez resté
loin de cet endroit.
Et vous, vous avez nulle part où aller ?
On est uniquement venu vous dire que
si vous ne remettez pas de l'ordre ici,
ce local deviendra illégal.
Ce ne sera plus votre syndicat qui le gérera,
mais un magistrat fédéral qui, depuis
son tribunal, décidera de tout.
Élisez donc de nouveaux représentants,
sinon la justice fera verrouiller cette entrée,
et vous resterez plantés dehors à regarder.
Un homme, un vote.
RECONDUISEZ FRANK SOBOTKA
COMME SECRÉTAIRE-TRÉSORIER.
Il avait des doigts ? Il avait un visage ?
Oui ? C'était pas nous, alors.
Tu crois pas que ça a quelque chose à voir
avec ce macchabée, non ?
C'est un peu léger, ça, Lester.
Ce pauvre gars n'a pas de visage.
Ai-je déjà dit que l'ADN correspondait ?
Ceci n'a aucun lien avec moi.
L'agent de sécurité, c'est bien lui ?
Walt Stokes, un gars très bien.
Ces rapports sont très détaillés.
Bunk, on m'a expliqué qu'on arrivait
à affiner chacune des images...
Jusqu'à ce qu'elle soit nette.
Ouais ? Fais voir ce que ça donne.
Mais je ne rêve pas ?
Une immatriculation du Maryland.
Juliet-Lima-Yankee.
Cinq, quatre, cinq.
C'est la plaque d'une voiture de location.
J'aimerais savoir qui l'a louée.
C'est un meurtre délibéré avec kidnapping.
Dans notre État, ça vaut la peine de mort.
Je n'ai pas tué ce mec.
J'étais là, mais je l'ai pas tué, ce mec.
Vondas l'a tué.
Il lui a tranché la gorge.
Le berger était censé veiller sur les filles.
Au lieu de ça, il a fait du fric avec.
Il y a une des filles qui s'est défendue.
Elle a été tuée.
Et ce crétin a liquidé les autres
par crainte des témoins.
Il devait mourir.
Tu veux un café ? Un soda ?
Une vodka.
Un café.
C'est élucidé. Les quatorze cas.
Grâce à la mort prématuré
d'un suspect connu.
En plus, on a aussi résolu le cas d'un
non identifié, rien que pour rire.
Vous voulez le dire à Rawls ?
Qu'il mijote encore dans son jus.
Par contre, ça, il faut le faire tout de suite.
Qui est l'homme au-dessus de Vondas ?
Le Grec.
C'est quoi, son nom ?
Si tu veux avoir une chance d'échapper
au couloir de la mort,
tu vas me dire maintenant
ce que tu sais sur la planque
de ces deux enfoirés.
Un hôtel. Sur le port.
Celui-ci ?
Non, un autre.
Je vous y conduis.
SVP NE PAS DÉRANGER
Allez !
Personne !
Affaires ou tourisme pour vous ?
Les affaires. Toujours les affaires.
- T'as oublié quelque chose ?
- Rien d'important.
Vous êtes tous venus au bar sans moi.
On s'est déjà fait baiser,
alors va te faire foutre.
- Ça va pas ?
- L'enquête est foutue.
Comment ça ?
Sobotka, le neveu, nous donne
la contrebande et la drogue.
Le Russe avoue le meurtre du conard
qui a tué les filles.
Mais on a raté Vondopoulos et le Grec.
- De beaucoup ?
- Ils se sont tirés.
On a un mandat d'arrêt national contre eux,
mais d'après le fils de Sobotka
ces types ont des passeports.
En plus, on connaît toujours pas le vrai
nom du Grec.
Que devient la partie drogue de l'enquête ?
Je crois qu'on devrait offrir Dixon et
Prop Joe aux Stups.
Peut-être qu'ils voudront reprendre l'affaire.
J'en sais rien.
Je rejetterais pas si vite Joe dans la mare.
L'équipe spéciale aurait de quoi
s'amuser avec eux, vous croyez pas ?
Lieutenant.
Je ne vous ai rien dit.
En fait, si vous répétez à quelqu'un
ce que je vais vous dire
je vais finir ma carrière
au Montana ou dans un autre trou mortel.
Pardon. Excusez-moi.
La fuite venait pas de chez vous.
Quand j'ai téléphoné pour avoir des
infos sur vos cibles,
j'ai utilisé le logiciel, vous savez ?
Je croyais parler à un pauvre conard
de San Diego.
C'était un mec de l'anti-terrorisme.
J'imagine que Vondopoulos et le Grec
lui rendaient des services.
Vous voyez, ils devaient les brancher
sur des magouilles.
Je suis désolé, lieutenant.
À ce que je vois, la Terre continue de tourner.
Vous allez attaquer une nouvelle affaire.
Vous regardez pas en arrière.
C'est ma tournée cette fois.
Ça intéresse personne ?
MOTEL El-Rich
Où est-ce que tu vas ?
Travailler.
Frank, t'es un trou du cul.
- Ça ira là, je peux y aller seul.
- C'est sûr ?
Ouais, personne vient nous emmerder ici.
Où est-ce que tu veux que j'aille ? Alors ?
Il y a un roulier à North Point.
Les vieux s'en sont occupé.
C'est tout ce qu'il y avait aujourd'hui.
L'ancienneté ça craint.
Ouais, quand t'en as pas surtout.
Salut, mec.
PROPRIÉTÉ DU CAPITAINE
DE GENDARMERIE
CET ENDROIT EST FERME
JUSQU'À NOUVEL ORDRE
FRATERNITÉ INTERNATIONALE
DE STEVEDORES - BALTIMORE, MARYLAND
Le Grenier
C'est un grand jour pour Baltimore.
LE GREC ?
ENQUÊTE AU PORT - 2003
Freezing my balls off.
It ain't so bad. Loosen up.
Couple more months, it's gonna be spring.
Spring, huh?
Listen, you gotta realize the bosses
did you a favor sending you down here.
-Citywide to Marine Unit.
-7672. Go ahead.
Distress call from a private craft.
60-foot white vessel. Engines are dead.
What's the location, Citywide?
In the channel near the bridge.
About 2,000 yards off the Armistead pier.
10-4, we're responding.
My father used to work there.
-Beth Steel?
-In the shipyards there, yeah.
I had an uncle who was a supervisor there.
Got laid off in '78, though.
'73 for my dad.
-Party boat?
-Pretty one, yeah.
-More than one engine, right?
-Probably an electrical problem.
Is that a police boat?
How are you tonight? Good to see you.
Henry, how are you?
-Drink?
-No, thanks.
-You're the Captain?
-Yeah.
-Harbormaster?
-No, City Police.
-So you're dead in the water?
-Think it's the starter.
-You're not a mechanic, are you?
-Me? No.
I can't tell the aft from the stern.
Best I can offer you is a tow line.
Claude, looks like they're gonna need a pull.
-10-4, we'll tow to Henderson's.
-That'll work.
Any chance you can hold off
on bringing us in?
Lot of partying going on now.
I wouldn't wanna cut it short
for a little engine trouble.
You're in the shipping channel.
You tow us somewhere out of the way,
and the band plays on a while longer.
...because you see what I'm saying, right?
I mean, three years in auto theft
and I didn't learn anything.
I didn't care.
I'm telling you,
I didn't even wanna be a police anymore.
I honestly didn't.
I think that was why
I shot up my car like I did.
But this thing we did on Barksdale,
the wiretap and all...
that felt like something.
That felt like something I wanna do.
So I was thinking, you know,
narcotics, maybe.
Major, you want this stuff where?
Just in here.
Up against the wall over there.
If there aren't any openings
in the regular narcotics shift...
maybe assets forfeiture
or something like that.
Easy. Everything breaks.
I mean, with this Barksdale thing...
Lester Freamon had us deep into the money.
Real deep.
We could've seized real estate, cash,
vehicles, all kinds of stuff.
If the bosses, I mean,
if command had let that case go forward.
We were on it.
-Look at that. It's the dove.
-Right.
-So what do you think?
-What do I think?
I think you're gonna take
the Sergeant's Exam next month.
And because I have Andy Krawczyk's ear...
and because he has City Hall's ear...
you're gonna make Sergeant.
Then you're gonna come out here
to the Southeast...
where, because I'm your father-in-law...
you're gonna be assigned a daytime shift
in a quiet sector.
Then you're gonna take the Lieutenant's
Exam where you'll also score high.
I don't want to make rank.
I want to work cases. Good cases.
Roland.
Listen to me.
You did good with the drug thing.
You buckled down, you did the work.
And except for that thing
with the Grand Jury...
you helped take
some of the stink off yourself.
Now if you'll just shut up and listen to me...
you might actually have a career
in this department.
-This radio ain't working that well.
-We're losing it.
-We're losing the station, man.
-What you mean?
We done gone so far from Baltimore,
we're losing the station.
-Try a Philly station or some shit like that.
-The radio in Philly is different?
Nigger, you gotta be fucking with me, right?
You never heard a station
outside of Baltimore?
I ain't never left Baltimore
except that Boys' Village shit one day.
And I wasn't trying to hear no radio
up in that bitch.
Come on, man. You're killing me. Stop.
It's been perfect tomato weather out there.
These wonderful hot, humid days,
and then rain at night.
-This a Philly station?
-How the fuck would I know?
Why would anybody wanna leave Baltimore?
That's what I'm asking.
Yo, that be the exit. Take that shit.
So far they on it.
Ahoy, matey.
The girls always tell me
about the little man in the boat.
-Now I know who they talking about.
-Come on board, man.
-Come on, I wanna show you.
-Fuck, no.
-What's the matter?
-The Bunk can't swim.
I ain't too good at floating, either.
So what brings you to the water's edge?
Ilene Nathan called.
Gant case is coming up in four weeks.
She wants to start doing preliminaries
on our witnesses.
That means the old lady from the projects,
which is no problem.
And your man Omar, who's in the wind.
You got a line on Omar, Jimmy?
-Well, he's not to starboard.
-That's port, fool.
-How the fuck would you know?
-Come on.
Let me buy you lunch
and we can think on this shit together.
I leave, I gotta tell my Sergeant.
That reminds me. Landsman wants his $10.
-What for?
-For betting that you'd ride the boat.
You tell that motherfucker
he's not gonna see that money...
especially since it was probably him
told Rawls where I didn't wanna go.
-Ain't the same up there without your ass.
-No?
Better, actually.
Hey, come on, now.
The canal gets dredged...
it means we all work.
Your people, my people.
The canal's the key, Nat. You know this.
Yeah, but you know how much money
you're gonna spend...
to even get them talking about that shit?
We don't take a shot,
we might as well roll over and die right now.
No, you get them to rebuild the grain pier.
-You got a 100 ships right there.
-That's break-bulk, Nat.
Best you'll do is one or two
extra gangs a week on them blowers.
That's six or seven-man gangs at best.
But you try for that, you might actually
come away with something.
You go down to Annapolis
asking for the goddamn canal...
you gonna come back with nothing but
your little shriveled-ass dick in your hand.
What's more,
if the grain pier don't get fixed up soon...
some asshole's gonna fuck us
by building condominiums all over it.
-Nat, if the canal were 2 feet deeper--
-Fuck the canal.
I'm going to the District Council.
I'm gonna tell them
to push for the grain pier.
-You feel me?
-Nat, calm the fuck down.
Goddamn Checkers Local always acting
like you're the king of everything and shit.
Nat, listen to me. If we--
Y'all need to crawl back down
in them holds...
and remind yourself of who you is
and where you come from.
Damn, Frank.
We just sat here and watched Nat Coxson
take a shit all over you.
And shrivel-dick motherfucker
that you are, you take it.
For your information...
I wake up every morning
with an angry, blue-veined diamond-cutter.
I was gonna enlighten the president
of Local 47 on this particular point...
and he chose to depart.
-Blue steel, gentlemen.
-For Christ's sake.
Three-and-a-half inches of hard blue steel.
-Nicky boy, you working today?
-As a lasher for Big Roy's crew.
Attaboy. Make the family proud.
First day they give me in two weeks.
-Is Ott around?
-On his ass as usual.
Worthless fuck still owes me $20
for them lotto tickets.
Hey, Nick.
You need to see the Greek
and get a number. He's got one on the way.
-Today?
-Tomorrow.
The Atlantic Light over at North Point.
All right.
-Yo, Frank.
-What's up?
You gotta get with Ziggy, man.
He's all over the place.
I'm here since 8:00.
You know I been here since 8:00.
-Hold your horses.
-You fucking goose.
I'm gonna find it for you.
Just shut the fuck up a minute.
How we doing?
-Ain't a problem, Chief.
-The fuck it ain't.
I'm down here since 8:00
for crane-to-chassis...
-and Tweety Bird here lost the can.
-It ain't lost.
It's right here on the manifest as a hot box.
Where is it, Zig?
-It's either in Bay 7, or--
-Bay 7 is empty, man.
Or it ain't. In that case...
it's definitely somewhere in the stacks.
Jesus fucking Christ.
You're killing me here, Ziggy.
You are fucking killing me.
Get me a number for your shipping agent.
I'll call and try to square it.
And you.
You clock out today and leave your box,
and don't ever come the fuck back.
You hear me, Zig? You're fired.
Later for you, goofus.
Fucking guy.
He loses his job and he couldn't care less.
-He ain't fired, man.
-No?
That's his father.
How fast you need this?
Case goes to trial in a month.
Got to start prepping it this week.
Officer Burns.
Detective.
I heard they posted you down here.
But, I mean, you know, damn.
These motherfuckers don't play, do they?
So what brings you downstairs?
I was pulling evidence on the Gant case.
You know, trial date for Bird is next month
and llene Nathan wanted to be ready.
You give him my love.
-Who?
-Bird.
-No evidence.
-What do you mean, no evidence?
Submission slip says
"Row BB, Section 14, Shelf 3...
"Four, Right rear." It says that.
-So?
-No such thing.
BB has 1 2 sections. This says 14.
You see what I'm saying?
No evidence.
Winters kill off
the weaker varieties of caterpillars.
-Fuck me.
-...that's of an entirely different breed....
Fuck.
...protection against caterpillars,
they eat right through it.
But it is a sort of a warning system.
They here.
Franoosh, you made it.
Right, Father. Got you covered here.
Come on.
You wanna see your window?
Only Franoosh Sobotka would send
all the way to Esslingen for stained glass.
The Germans are hard-headed,
but you can't beat them for craft.
I was glad to do it, Father,
for the church, you know.
Truth is I need to ask you
something in return.
Anything I can do.
-I need some face time with the Senator.
-Barbara?
She comes to the early mass on Sunday,
the one in Polish.
We got nothing but problems, Father.
We need to see something happen
with the C&D Canal...
and the grain pier's been down for a year.
I got tough guys coming in
to confess things I never heard before.
I don't need you to tell me
how bad things are at the docks.
So you'll set something up
with Mikulski soon?
You didn't need a German window
to ask me for that, Francis.
And what's more...
you've made offerings
way above what it would take...
to get that window up there.
How long since your last confession?
I'll see you, Father.
This shit might be somewhere else, man.
Yo, the shit is always up in the door, man.
Motherfucker, you been
standing there watching us.
You see any shit come up out of there?
You seen we ain't take shit up off this car.
-All right.
-You seen it.
Who gonna believe us? This shit is missing.
And fuck what you're saying.
All he's gonna hear
is that this shit is fucking missing.
Yo, check it again.
Yo, the shit ain't there, man.
Call your man and say so.
Nigger, what you say?
-I said check it again, God damn it!
-Whoa, chill.
Yo, man, cut that shit the fuck out.
What the fuck is going on today, man?
Taking their time, ain't they?
What the hell is going on?
Come on, man.
Damn!
-Ain't anywhere in this section either.
-Start on the next row.
Lieutenant, those two bags could be
anywhere in this damn basement.
You're right.
-We could be here all night.
-Right again.
So that's overtime, right?
Fuck me. I still cannot type.
Fucking white boys, I love them.
I fucking love them.
-Yeah?
-Dumb as a box of rocks.
-Who?
-White boys.
Talking about the brain-deads
in my Kane Street case.
I call him up,
I tell him I wanna buy some drugs.
You know what he says?
"Okay, I'll sell you the drugs.
How much drugs do you want?"
I swear to God, Kima, they don't code it,
they don't ask for a meet, nothing.
And then when you make the deal,
there's no runner, no bullshit.
It's the guy himself
walking up to you, saying:
"I brought the drugs.
Did you bring the money?"
I'm not kidding.
I have much respect for black people...
after working with these idiots
for two weeks.
If white boys wanna sell drugs in Baltimore,
they have to make different laws for it...
Iike even it out for them.
-Affirmative action.
-Leave no white man behind.
-What the fuck do you want?
-I need you to do the seizures.
You got titles, deeds, registrations?
What do you have for me?
Thought you did that.
You're the Forfeiture Unit, right?
I write all the affidavits
and the filing for the City Solicitor.
But you've gotta give me the information
on what we're taking.
That's a fucking hassle.
You want the property, do the paperwork.
You gotta step up, Herc.
You don't have me or Carver to lean on here.
No?
How about you come
on the raids tomorrow?
Take a few doors with me
for old time's sake.
You taking doors?
Yeah, two houses and a bar on Kane Street.
Come on, Kima, mount up with us.
I know you miss it.
I'm done rolling around the gutter.
I am inside now.
-You're a housecat now?
-I made a promise.
I gotta say, Kima. If you were a guy...
and, actually, in some ways
you're better than most guys I know.
If you were a guy, your friends
would buy you a beer and let you know.
-Let me know what?
-You're fucking whipped.
-Whipped?
-Pussy-whipped within an inch of your life.
I kid you not.
So....
So?
So where do we find Omar?
Who?
-He say anything else?
-No.
Just to come back. All of us.
How he say it?
You know, he just said it.
-Fuck.
-Yeah.
Shit.
-They holding to it?
-So far.
All right.
They got the times right?
How about the mileage?
All right.
So I'm gonna ask you one more time.
-You never saw him out the car?
-No.
-You stayed with him the whole time?
-Every minute.
How long before he came out
the parking garage?
-How long was he on his own?
-Not enough time to do shit, String.
He was in and out, like, in three minutes.
Chill.
-This shit is fucked up.
-Look--
You follow the directions?
-I did just like you told me.
-Wrote down the mileage?
-Yeah.
-Let me see.
See, right there.
No, you're three-tenths of a mile long, dawg.
And if you followed directions,
you wouldn't be.
String, I did everything like I should, man.
I swear.
You got answers?
You didn't have to take a detour
in Camden...
when they shut down a couple of blocks
on the Boulevard?
You hurt your foot?
-My foot?
-You know, the way you kicked that tire jack.
-You was on us the whole time?
-Who, me?
Y'all had people following us.
So where it at?
You know, you should take me with you.
I should meet these guys.
If I meet these guys...
we can figure out ways to do business.
You know what I'm saying?
-Zig, these guys are real.
-What, I ain't real?
Six degrees.
Everybody's going home
to sauerkraut and Santy Claus...
and here comes a gang of us
walking the other way...
Little Big Roy with his wooden leg.
-Christ, them wooden shovels.
-Yeah.
You children don't know nothing
about them wooden shovels, do you?
Can't have no sparks
when you working grain.
-Kaboom.
-It's more like kaput.
You never gonna see another grain ship
here in Bawlmer, my friends.
Zig, you believe these fucking dinosaurs?
They sit around all day talking shit about
how they used to off-load with shovels...
and carry fucking railroad cars
on their backs.
Shit, and drink whiskey through a fire hose.
Go home and fuck their wives till breakfast.
There was some heroes back then.
Shit is thick in here tonight, gentlemen.
What can you do?
This generation, they just don't know.
-Ain't never gonna be what it was.
-No, indeed.
Every night with these old fucks.
It's like 1952 and shit.
Boys, you know, when I was your age,
I unloaded ten ships a goddamn day.
You know, I'd do it with one arm...
after a 300-pound bag of Polish dildos
fell on me.
Whoa, wait. What the fuck is a Polish dildo?
Whoa, wait. What the fuck is a Polish dildo?
Actually, at my house, it's a ring of kielbasa.
Christ, here we go again.
Bring out pretty boy.
But, you know, where you boys hail from,
I'm sure any old breakfast link will do.
You know he's gonna
pull out his dick, right?
That boy ain't right.
It was just me...
and my old wooden leg,
and my old wooden shovel...
and my glass eye, and my Polish pencil.
Like anyone from the Checkers Local
ever used anything but a real pencil.
Shit, they don't even push
one of them no more.
Talking trash about 1514.
Jesus H. Christ, you know what?
All hands starboard.
Come on.
The old tub is listing. Can you feel her?
You wanna know why?
'Cause them old fucks
done unloaded so much bullshit...
that this whole motherfucker's
gonna capsize.
Brace yourselves, we're sinking.
God damn it, Ziggy.
You're not taking your dick out
in here again.
Let me show you old gents some bulk cargo
that none of you could ever handle.
Who says they don't make them
like they used to?
Pretty boy is on the town tonight.
Fucking Ziggy, man.
-Bring her in the boat?
-Hell, no.
-She'll fall apart if we try to bring her in.
-What's the plan then?
We'll hook her real good.
We'll tow her slowly over to the pier.
-What's she look like?
-What do you mean?
-How long you think she's been in?
-She's fresh.
-Legs are broke, though.
-Probably a jumper from the bridge.
All right, Ma. Shit.
Kitchen's closed.
There's no service for drunks
who can't get up in time to catch a ship.
What ship?
Your father says the Talco Line is in today.
That makes two ships at North Point.
It's the Atlantic Light.
Ain't due until this afternoon.
That still is no excuse.
Good morning, Mom.
Couple of goddamn drunks I got.
And don't leave
without taking your cousin with you.
I gotta clean in there,
and I ain't gonna do it around his carcass.
You keep us guessing, don't you, Stan?
At Sunday mass, you can't be found.
But early on a Tuesday,
you arrive with an army.
$2,500 from myself and every other Polack...
in three districts and four firehouses.
-And to what do we owe such generosity?
-A surprise.
We ordered up a window
for where you renovated the nave.
A memorial. Let me see that.
To Polish police and firefighters.
Found this craftsman down in Glen Burnie
that you would not believe.
-For the nave?
-Yeah, for the nave.
We could use another window
on the second floor of the rectory.
-The rectory?
-The upstairs hallway.
How much did them dock boys offer
for this spot?
-I can match it.
-Offerings are confidential, Stan.
-And as you can see--
-I can go as high as $4,000.
Just tell me if they went higher than $4,000.
More than $4,000? From the docks?
How the hell....
I'm sorry, Father.
-Who came to you with the offer?
-Francis Sobotka.
Frank Sobotka has that kind of money?
-It was from his local.
-The Checkers?
-They don't have 100 guys left paying dues.
-It's a parish of givers, Stan.
Maybe you talk to Frank.
Work it out somehow.
Yeah, we'll talk.
Major?
Well, if it isn't Barnacle Bill, the sailor.
Ray, how you been?
I got nothing but red ink
under my name this year.
Landsman's become an asshole with teeth.
-Fish your wish, huh?
-Jumper, probably.
-This close to the bridge.
-Probably, yeah.
-Pretty, though.
-She is, yeah.
I go into the men's room this morning.
Guess who's in the next stall
puking his guts out.
Bunk Moreland.
-How'd you know?
-Useless fuck can't hold his liquor.
-What's happening, man?
-What's up, Fam?
All right.
-You ain't heard from Roberto yet?
-Not a goddamn word, man.
Billy still got our money though, right?
So you need to get down to New York, man.
Fuck kind of game this nigger playing?
You sure of our people?
I broke down all their stories
and they came back clean.
Besides, I had some good people
watching them.
-Who?
-Tank, Country.
-How long that motherfucker been home?
-A month.
Still on parole. He said, "fuck that."
Straight back in the mix.
All right.
So good, it ain't on us. It's on Roberto.
Set it straight. You know what I mean?
So when you go hard on them,
take it light, but be firm.
They got our money
and we ain't got the product.
So, you feel me? The shit ain't right.
How you fixed in here otherwise, B?
This ain't no thing, man.
You know what I mean?
You come in here, man,
you get your mind right.
You get in here and you do two days.
It's the day you come in this motherfucker--
-And the day you get out this motherfucker.
-That's right.
Exactly.
-What's up?
-How you doing?
-Coming from the hiring hall?
-I'm working the Atlantic late today.
-How's it looking for Local 47?
-You're shit out of luck.
ROIROs isn't going to anybody
lower than a G-series.
Best you can get,
maybe half a day doing break-bulk...
on an aluminum load at Locust Point.
-Half a day, huh?
-Seniority sucks.
-Yeah, if you ain't senior, it does.
-Yeah, you got that right.
-I'm out of here.
-Yeah, I'll see you.
-The fuck you ain't wake me up for?
-Just getting up now, fuck-face?
No, actually,
your ma makes a good breakfast.
-No fucking way.
-Bacon and eggs, baby.
You going down to see the Greek, right?
Come on, man.
I ain't gonna fuck it up for you.
For Christ's sake,
will you just get in the car already?
Come on. Let's go.
I swear to God, Ziggy.
You open your mouth, I'll fucking kill you.
-Nicky, from the docks.
-Spiros.
How are you? Good?
-Who's your friend?
-This is Zig, my uncle's kid.
-Your uncle? Frankie?
-Yeah.
Ziggy's his oldest.
My car broke down, you know. He drove.
So you must be the Greek.
Well, I'm Greek anyway.
Boris Badanoff.
I know you from around the way, right?
Why am I Boris? I don't understand this.
Everywhere I am Boris.
-Shit, you're Russian, right?
-No, Ukraine. Kyiv is Ukraine.
-It's the same difference, though.
-No, you're wrong.
What's the matter?
You don't like being called Boris?
Sergei.
No way, man. Boris is way better.
It's like the guy from the cartoon.
Boris and Natasha?
Bullwinkle, man. Rocky and Bullwinkle.
-You want some coffee, pie?
-No, I'm good.
-Actually, what kind of pie you got?
-Hey, Zig.
Shut the fuck up, huh?
Malaka.
No, it's cool. He's cool.
-That's Frank's kid?
-Yeah.
He's in the Union, you know.
But he's like an L-series,
so he ain't getting any hours.
-Same deal, same rate.
-All right. Who's driving?
Again?
You want to mix it up a little more.
Make it so customs doesn't put
no names to faces.
You trust a man, you stay with him.
-Okay.
-All right.
Boris it is.
-Sergei.
-Yeah, whatever.
Come on, fucknuts. Let's go.
-How's the open-face turkey?
-It's shit. Let's go.
See you guys later.
-Bullwinkle?
-Polacks.
You fucking embarrassed me in there, man.
You embarrassed yourself, Zig.
You seen my nephew anywhere?
Nick? Not yet.
I don't think he got any hours.
-Hey, Frank.
-Hey, darling.
Just so I can finish my paperwork early,
what are your people gonna steal today?
I don't know.
Couple luxury sedans,
some color TVs, wide-screen.
Maybe a couple cans of vodka,
maybe a whole container ship.
Okay. Y'all have a good one.
You let her fuck with you like that?
She's all right. I like her.
I checked the computer.
It's Bay 9, Cell 1 1 . It's right on the bottom.
-You working the light, ain't you?
-I'm on it, yeah.
-Did they say anything else?
-No. Just that it's the same money to us.
Let's go.
All right, Uncle Frank.
-Winona.
-Jimmy, where you been?
Look who it is. Sailor Boy.
-You owe me $10.
-Fuck you.
You told Rawls where I didn't wanna go.
You made it happen, Jay.
-I told him where you didn't wanna go.
-Yeah, and they sent me there.
I knew Rawls was pissed,
I didn't know how pissed.
What can I tell you?
-Where's Bunk?
-Out on a call with Crutchfield.
What's up with the girl?
She come off the bridge or what?
Doc Frazier posted her today.
Blunt-force trauma to the head and chest.
He says she's dead
before she hits the water.
What about the defense wounds?
Bruising on three fingers?
We saw that as soon as we picked her up.
You missed the defense wounds?
I wasn't looking.
Thought she went off the bridge.
Also, she's in the drink
with no coat or shoes.
Maybe that stuff comes off in the water,
maybe not.
I don't see her going to the bridge in winter
dressed like she was.
But then that's just me.
Tell Bunk I was here, will you?
Have fun.
We already had our fun.
Dumping her on Baltimore County.
On the County?
You fished her out east of the bridge.
That's Baltimore County. She's their stat.
-You sold them on that?
-Rawls did.
He called up the Colonel and said:
"You got one hell of a murder
on your hands."
It's all about self-preservation, Jimmy.
Something you never learned.
Hey, Norris. State Police, Line 2.
A little to the right!
Good, bring her down!
It's there whenever they want it.
Now that you are my client, Mr. Bell...
we are protected
by the attorney-client privilege.
-I thought Roberto would be here.
-Not likely.
This, I'm afraid, was in Monday's papers.
It seems Roberto Castellano y Silva
has been targeted by the DEA.
That's why we didn't do the business?
Right now, Roberto and his people aren't
going to be getting involved in anything...
that could further complicate the situation.
You know, usually, when you take a fall,
you get right back in there...
-'cause you know nobody's watching, right?
-Sometimes.
And sometimes you wonder
how it is you got caught in the first place.
And you decide to change the pattern.
He took our money?
Your advance payment arrived
as our problem did.
And I'm told the money
is on the way back to Baltimore.
You know, I get the feeling
that you're blaming us...
for Roberto's predicament.
Perhaps your problems in Baltimore
and my client's problems here...
are coincidental.
-But right now--
-Listen to me.
He was the first to know that we took a hit.
He knows no one came close
to rolling over us...
and all the documents from the case.
Nonetheless, we have a legitimate concern.
Considering the scope
of Mr. Barksdale's operation...
his sentence was, to say the least, mild.
But if the possibility exists,
however unlikely...
that the leniency he received
was the result of cooperation....
You understand our position, I'm sure.
Frank, it's sitting out there waiting...
and this Russian fuck
won't take it off the pier.
I ain't blind.
I don't like it
sitting out in the open that long.
The customs seal is broke.
Somebody's gonna see it.
Our asses are hanging out here.
-Yeah?
-Nicky, what the fuck? It's still here.
-Shit.
-Yeah.
-Where's Sergei?
-He's parked at the end of the lot.
-What's he waiting for?
-I got no fucking idea.
But the ship's almost empty.
They need to shit or get off the pot.
-I'll look into it.
-Yeah.
Okay, I understand.
Fuck it. Get it on a fifth wheel
and lose it in the stack. We're at risk.
I ain't lying when I say
this paperwork is kicking my ass.
Maybe so. But the end of the day,
you come through the door in one piece.
You like to think so.
But all these paper cuts
are starting to take their toll.
You big, nasty detective. Come here.
Let me give your little boo-boo a kiss.
-All this?
-I'm just getting started.
$1000 for the doctor.
$1000 each time, girlfriend.
Every month till I'm pregnant.
There's gotta be a better way.
That would be on you, sweetheart.
Come up with a suitable donor
and we pay a lot less.
Not with your pussy
would I fuck anyone of these guys.
What did you just say?
No, you didn't just say that.
Sergeant.
Your floater's come back.
County boys are putting her
on our side of the bridge.
-No fucking way.
-Yeah.
Some useless fuck in our Marine Unit
faxed them a report...
on the early morning tides
and wind currents.
Shows the body went in the water
west of the bridge and drifted out.
McNulty.
Fucking Jimmy.
Fucking with us for the fun of it.
I gotta give the son of a bitch
some credit for wit on this one.
-Cocksucker.
-Motherfucker.
The count is right. What's on the shelf?
Mace carrying 10 down here.
So, Moe Man holding about 38 up top.
I checked the stash, and we way low.
-Moe Man taking our shit.
-What he holding?
He say he holds about 30-something,
but I know that ain't right.
I'm gonna fuck him up.
First thing you think to do
is fuck a nigger up.
When your brick brain gonna realize
there's more to this...
than just thumpin' on niggers?
-What Moe supposed to be holding?
-38, thereabout.
-Ain't you the damn fool?
-But then we low.
Look, nigger, if we low,
it 'cause String want us that way.
When he wants us up, we be up.
String is on top of the shit.
He on top of everything.
Go back to your spot, man.
Fucking McNulty.
The Prince of Tides.
-Brother, you feeling strong today?
-Yeah.
See if you can get his ass out of that chair.
He said it was fine
if you wanted to hit him, too.
What's the first thing a guy from Local 47
does after he gets laid?
-What?
-Wipes the pepper spray from his eyes.
Hey, Frank. Something's going on.
-It's fucking girls, man. Young ones.
-There's a dozen of them.
Dead? They're dead?
Thirteen bodies, all female...
eleven White, two Asian-looking.
All between the ages of maybe 20, 30.
All very dead.
From Eastern Europe probably.
So this is, what, an accident?
Your air pipe's up top, crushed.
Probably during the off-load.
So, yeah, accidental probably.
But that's his call, right?
-Doctor.
-Frazier.
How're we doing here?
-How are we doing?
-I mean, what are we doing?
What's the plan with all this?
Is this your first
death investigation, Officer?
Russell. Yeah, first and onliest.
You got 13 for the price of one.
We're gonna start cutting this afternoon.
Anything you got by way of identifications
should come through my office.
What identification?
So far, we don't have
a passport or visa in the bunch.
Whatever you find in this luggage,
send it over...
or they're all going to the Anatomy Board
as Jane Does.
Who's the investigating agency?
If they were alive, they'd be illegals,
and that would mean lmmigration.
-But they're dead, so they're cargo.
-Cargo, but no contraband.
There's nothing to be seized
as a customs violation.
They're dead
on Port Authority property, right?
-Yeah.
-That's a state thing.
We'll eat it.
If it's accidental, then it's just about IDs
on these stowaways, right?
Good enough for me, brother.
No reason to open a full case folder
that I can see.
Wait a minute.
You CID guys are rolling out on this?
No crime, no investigation.
All you've got right here, Officer Russell,
is a lot of paperwork.
And then there was one.
-You don't have to do this.
-No?
Anything you're gonna say
I already said to Spiros.
You called him a Greek asshole?
You think we wanted this?
I don't know what the fuck
you people want and don't want.
All I know is, I got a can full of young girls
suffocating to death on my docks.
-This was a mistake.
-A mistake?
They fucking died in that can...
while this stupid son of a bitch sat there
with his dick in his hands.
You know nothing.
We understand you're upset, Frank.
We are upset, too, okay?
Sergei was supposed to wait
for our friend to come off the boat.
Our friend was supposed to tell us
that there was no problem...
you know, no Customs.
-He did not come off the boat.
-Why the fuck not?
This is what we're trying to find out.
We don't know.
Because you don't get the right message,
these girls are dying on my docks?
This is how it goes?
On my docks, this happened!
I understand how you feel...
but we're upset, too.
Everybody, we're all upset.
Nobody here wanted this.
Uncle Frank,
they're saying it wasn't on purpose.
You could've told me
there were girls in that fucking can.
You could've told me,
so I didn't just shove them back...
in the stacks like I did, right?
Why didn't you tell me
what was in that motherfucking can?
Now you want to know what's in the cans?
Before, you wanted to know nothing.
Now, you ask.
Guns, okay?
Drugs, whores, vodka, BMWs...
beluga caviar or bombs, maybe.
-Bad terrorists with big nuclear bombs.
-Boom.
I am kidding you, Frank, it's a joke.
But you don't ask...
because you don't want to know.
Tell the Greek that next time
he's got something breathing...
in one of them cans, I need to know it.
Give him a couple of days, you know?
So Roberto been caught?
Yep, DEA got him in New York.
Now the shit makes some sense.
The money we sent for the last go-round
came back. All of it.
Damn, they ain't gonna touch us now?
Goddamn Dominicans running around
scared acting like we the problem.
Roberto won't even see us.
Stringer had to go to the lawyer up there.
They saying they have to be sure
before they get back with us.
-They saying you only got seven years, so--
-So I'm a motherfucking snitch?
They ain't saying they think it.
They just don't know how
the Feds got to Roberto.
-So we on the outside.
-Yep.
Look...
we hanging on to them projects with scraps.
Avon, you gotta have somebody for us.
A friend in Atlanta...
owns a rim shop, name of Vargus.
Have Stringer fly down there tomorrow
and meet him.
You seen D'Angelo lately?
He on the J-tier, you know what I mean?
It's very difficult for me to get over there,
you know?
So you ain't checking on him,
and Donette's out and about.
-I don't know what's what anymore.
-Now, what's up with Donette?
I leave messages, she ain't call back.
She ain't had her ass down here
regular neither.
We need to tighten shit up, Avon.
She should be bringing his son by
every week.
Yeah, I'm gonna put Stringer on that, too.
After all he has done for us...
Dee needs to be cared for, Avon.
-Promises were made.
-I know.
He took the 20, he ain't complaining.
He is carrying a lot of weight for this family.
And we keeping him close.
Dee being cold toward me right now.
He in this motherfucker trying
to make adjustments and shit.
Adjustments?
Brianna...
you know damn well I ain't gonna let shit
happen to him, right?
-You got these off the boat?
-What, in winter?
In a couple of months. Fringe benefit.
Can't catch crabs in Homicide, right?
Except maybe
the occasional emergency room nurse...
every now and again.
-Need some air in here.
-Leave it.
I don't need the hassle if Rawls comes past.
You're not the run-of-the-mill
kind of asshole, are you?
-You're the special kind of asshole.
-I'm special, all right.
How long did it take you
to figure out the tide...
took that girl over the county line?
-Three hours.
-Three hours...
with your little harbor maps...
and your tide tables
just to stick Rawls with an extra body.
Never mind that you just fucked Cole
with a stone whodunit.
-That's collateral damage.
-Yeah.
Are you gonna waste that crab gut?
You're a pussy, besides, Jimmy.
-We need Omar, Jimmy.
-You see this.
-Thirteen girls?
-Yeah, I heard about it.
-Who caught it?
-It ain't ours.
Port police has jurisdiction over Patapsco.
Ain't gonna be a murder either,
so who gives a fuck?
Listen, Jimmy, I ain't got no case on Bird...
unless that crazy motherfucker
Omar testifies. You hear me?
It's time you show Bunk the love.
-You want love, you come and sit on my lap.
-Shit.
This pretty motherfucker
comes over and tells me...
the customs seal got broke on the dock
and I'm responsible.
Can you fucking believe that?
I seen the goddamn thing on the crane,
the seal's already broke.
Who got to it?
The crew probably.
Some goddamn ordinary seamen.
-What was it?
-Vodka, I think.
I ain't saying
we didn't squeeze a case or two...
but fuck it, Frank, the can was already open.
I didn't come to the union hall today
on the back of no bread truck.
I swear, Frank,
we grabbed a couple cases at the end...
after everyone of them
sailor boys damn near raped it.
-A couple of cases?
-Yeah, it was four.
-What the fuck is up with the police?
-What?
They're stroking tickets
on every fucking car.
"Rear tag not entirely visible?"
You got the tow bar set high.
"Emergency access blocked."
Are you kidding me?
We've been parking this side of the building
since the fucking ships had sails.
Come on, pal, what the fuck?
-It ain't me, it's my boss.
-Who's your boss?
-Valchek, Southeast district.
-Stan Valchek?
The district commander, yeah.
That sawed-off piece of shit.
Why the hell is he fucking with us?
Whatever it's about,
you definitely got the man's attention...
'cause word comes down
this morning from my shift lieutenant...
we're to ride past your union hall
twice a day and paper cars.
-You work for a gaping asshole.
-More than one actually.
We're not gonna put up with this shit,
we're gonna go downtown on it.
Take it all the way to the mayor's office,
I can't blame you, but leave me out of it.
It's chain of command.
I mean, I gotta live
with the son of a bitch, too, right?
-You can't tell me this place ain't clean.
-You talk when I say you can.
Who told you to decorate, nigger?
Cell look pretty fucked up to me.
What you calling clean?
-Man, I ain't done shit.
-Don't say that to me, motherfucker!
Pets, too?
No, you see, they plastic,
they got little motors and all, man.
Clean this shit before lock-down.
That's four in a row, bitch!
Wait here, this won't take long.
What do you want from me?
He's an E-rate and you're a "G."
He wants the ship, he gets the ship.
Seniority, Mims, seniority.
-There ain't no union without it, brother.
-Your sweetheart's out there.
Who?
I gotta go, Mims, I got to.
-Kind of empty in here.
-Everyone's working.
-You getting the message?
-The message?
I had people working on a window
for the nave up St. Casmir's since Easter...
you know that?
I took money from half a dozen
different people...
told them where it was gonna go.
-You tell Father Lewandowski?
-I was gonna surprise him.
Yeah, you surprised everybody.
Now there's one window too many, right?
Here's the thing, Father Lew says...
he could take another window
in the rectory on the second floor.
-Good for you.
-No, good for you, Frank.
You don't want my finger in your eye,
you better do what's right here.
What's right?
What's right would be for you
to come down here to my house...
Iike a decent human being
and ask a common courtesy.
But that's not you, it's not your way.
My old man always said
you were a half-ass punk...
over at Holy Redeemer as a kid.
My sister said you were a pain in the ass
pest at all them CYO dances...
where none of the girls
would even look at you.
Damn near everyone at the Point said
when you got your badge...
it was too much for anybody named Valchek
to have a patrolman's drag.
And sure enough, you've been
an official asshole every day since.
Fuck you! And your window!
Where are you gonna be?
I'm gonna go find some lunch
somewhere, maybe.
-Give me an hour, yeah?
-Yeah.
-What the fuck is this?
-A knot.
Why don't you just do bunny ears?
So what else we got?
Medics, clothes, bedrolls, that's it.
-Here's a letter, though.
-A letter? What language?
Who knows?
Same backwards-ass writing, though.
That's like Russian or something,
I'm telling you.
Can't figure the name or the address...
but the stamp says "Magyar" on it.
-Where's Magyar?
-What the hell do I look like, Rand McNally?
Which one of your detectives caught
all the dead girls?
Detectives? They're at the bar already.
These yours?
They chalked it up as an accidental
and dumped the paperwork on us.
She found them, she writes on it.
-I'm McNulty, City Marine Unit.
-Beatrice Russell.
-You got any IDs yet?
-No visas or passports.
A few scraps of paper,
but nothing to make sense of.
Russian alphabet on most of it.
You just curious?
-Yeah.
-Why?
Day before yesterday I fished out a Jane Doe
from near the bridge.
There's no missing person report on file.
We got 14 bedrolls and 13 bodies.
-Mine was a murder.
-A murder, you're kidding me?
We got some photos,
if you wanna take a look.
I called the morgue this morning...
the only thing they can say
is the dental work isn't local.
Overseas, they think.
Overseas, they think.
-Is that your girl?
-Think so.
Looks better here.
You got her in the water,
day before yesterday, out by the bridge?
0900 hours, by the Fort Armistead dock.
Why would you have a murdered girl
in the water...
and the rest of them are suffocating
in a can at Patapsco?
-What went wrong?
-Air pipe up top got crushed.
Happened when cargo shifted around,
most likely.
They had cargo up front of the container
with a false back after about 25 feet.
You had cartons stacked in front...
but a tight passage to a small door
in the false wall...
opens from the outside only.
-They're in here the whole trip?
-Probably not.
Once they're at sea,
there's usually someone in the crew...
who's in on it, you know, a shepherd.
He let's them out to eat, move around,
use the bathroom, whatever.
They were clawing at the wall for air.
That's what the medical examiner
said anyway.
-Where's the air pipe?
-That's the hole. Pipe's up top.
You get a lot of stowaways?
Some. Usually it's Customs
or INS that finds them.
Most are Dominicans or Haitians,
or from that part of the world, anyway.
-Not so much from Europe?
-A bit more since 9l1 1, actually.
I think because people can't get in
on visas anymore...
Iike they used to. There you go.
Usually, if the shepherd is doing his job...
he tries to put a can like this
on bottom of the stack...
so they can pop it and the girls
just walk out on the floor of the hold.
Where was this one?
-Look.
-What?
-That look right to you?
-What do you mean?
-You said you were with the Marine Unit?
-Yeah.
What does the Marine Unit have to do
with a bunch of dead girls in a can?
Not a thing.
What do you want me to do?
You can go to Father Lew,
ask him to give Sobotka back his money.
Switch the windows, maybe.
You ever in your life
seen a priest give money back?
The guy pays for a window,
he gets a window.
I thought you had suction.
At City Hall, I got suction.
Down Annapolis, I got suction.
But who but the Pope has any drag
with the cardinal? Get over it.
How the fuck's he get
that kind of money anyway?
Now, that's a good question.
I mean, the whole l.B.S.
can't have 1,500 guys left in this town...
and there ain't 100 checkers.
They got the car ships coming in...
the roll-onlroll-off cargo
is keeping them afloat.
-That's all they got?
-Pretty much.
Past six months,
l.B.S. hired Bruce Dibiago's people...
to lobby for them down in Annapolis.
They've been good
with the political contributions.
They're throwing around a lot of cash.
-How can they?
-You tell me.
Dibiago does not come cheap.
This is real money we're talking.
You know what I think?
I think Francis Sobotka's into some dirt.
You're the cop, not me.
The Grainery?
So I hear Burrell's gonna be
the next police commissioner.
Yeah, I've seen worse.
See, if it's crushed by another container,
it should've been one single movement...
maybe two if something shifts,
and then shifts back again.
This looks like someone has been pounding
on it in a bunch of spots.
See?
Before I rule it, I wanna go down
with a metallurgist to be sure.
But yeah, from the look of it...
you just bought yourself 13 homicides.
Congratulations.
If the commissioner
goes down to Washington, it's you, right?
That's for the mayor to decide.
I'd have to clear the council, too.
If the mayor wants you,
that's not much of a problem.
You been around as long as me,
you make a few enemies.
What, the First District guys?
They're not gonna start nothing.
-They're pushing Shipley.
-See, that's racist.
You know, it personally offends me
that anybody would reach down past you...
to elevate some colonel
just because he happens to be white.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna get on the phone
and call my friends at the Hall.
That'll bring the First District in line.
That's very kind.
And what if anything is there
that I can do for you, Maj. Valchek?
Funny you should ask. I need a detail.
CID people mostly, though I can spare
some bodies out of my district, too.
What for?
I got some guys in the Southeast
that are showing a lot of money.
-Port guys, longshoremen.
-I.B.S.?
I'm not talking about going after
the whole union.
Just a couple of guys in one local
that look fat.
Drugs, maybe, or the usual thieving.
-Frank Sobotka, you heard the name?
-No.
And I'm not saying the problem
even goes past him.
-What's he to you?
-To me?
He's an asshole.
Six men for six weeks.
Rawls will pick them.
You ordered more than you ate.
It's cold out here.
Cedric, I shouldn't have brought it up again,
I'm sorry.
You're right. You're always right.
I'm just saying you have to be realistic.
You did what you did,
and now you are where you are.
In the basement.
If they buried you any deeper,
you'd be under the damn building.
Burrell won't be there forever.
Burrell is going to be the next
police commissioner, and you know it.
But you've got the law degree.
With your police experience, half a dozen
firms would think you're a prize.
You've got options.
-Just because they don't--
-You're right.
I'll put in my papers.
-Who wants breakfast?
-Christ, it's about time.
Lucky's was closed.
I had to go to the metro.
I thought Mutt be working North Point
today. He like them Ro-ro ships.
No, his wife is having some kind of
operation, so he gave back his hours.
-Who got them?
-New Charles works for Mutt.
Yo, Zig. You working today?
No, came down here to have breakfast
with you duper-faced fucks.
Most important goddamn meal
of the goddamn day, right?
-Set them up, Dolores, Zig is thirsty.
-That's right, I'm thirsty.
You know what?
Bottoms up, you ugly whores.
-Nick.
-What's up?
Come here.
-I got a line on something.
-Oh, yeah?
You know White Mike
from down Curtis Bay?
-He's gonna stake me to a package.
-A package?
Dope, Nicky, dope.
I got work today, Zig.
Yeah, and I'm gonna make as much money
not working. You see what I'm saying?
-So why the fuck you coming to me?
-I want you to come in on it with me.
You bring a little cash as money down,
my man might give us a bigger package.
We turn it around, we both get paid.
All right, ship's in, gentlemen.
-Fuck that shit, Zig.
-Time to work!
-Nicky, come on, man.
-Can I ride with you?
Will you think about it?
Dolores, can I get another shot?
-What's up?
-DWI checkpoint.
Step out of the car for a Breathalyzer.
It's 8:00 in the goddamn morning.
Who the fuck gets drunk
at 8:00 in the morning?
Bill, I'm not arguing
that the jurisdiction's not technically ours.
Patapsco's definitely Port Authority property
and the Port Police have the jurisdiction.
-That's not in dispute here.
-Good.
But they're not equipped
for a death investigation.
You dump 13 bodies on them,
you're dumping them on us.
MSP is gonna have to pick up that slack,
overburdened as we are.
Robbie, I have fought and scratched
and clawed for four months...
to get my clearance rate up above 50%...
and right now, it stands at exactly 51.6%.
Do you happen to know
what my clearance rate will be...
if I take 13 whodunits off your hands?
-39.4%.
-Bill, like I told you--
We did not get to be colonels
by being complete fucking idiots, right?
Robbie, you poor bastard,
you look like you need a cup of coffee.
The man is a god.
Big chief.
I gotta get him back to maximum security
by 6:00, all right?
Yeah. Come on in, man.
Here, sit down.
Fix yourself something to eat, man.
-No, man, I ain't hungry, I ate.
-What?
You crazy, this is good shit, man.
-Better get in this.
-No.
Look, man...
if he tearing your room down, man...
we keep bringing more stuff in.
It's gonna get so he can't tear it down
fast enough. You feel me?
He fucked with my fish though, I don't....
He ain't have to go there, man.
-What's up with this motherfucker?
-You remember Ladontay?
Burner from over the Poe Homes?
Caught him over at Carver parking lot
after school?
We did that?
Tilghman was Ladontay's cousin
or some such.
He found out I ate the charge,
he busting my chops.
Ladontay? I can't even remember that one.
You need a scorecard
to keep up with your lethal ass.
Avon, he fixing to stay in my shit.
Listen. I'm gonna talk to him, all right?
I'm gonna set it straight. All right?
-What's his name again?
-Tilghman, he work the dayshift on J-tier.
I seen him around.
Man, all these CO's are fronting and shit.
You got the guards bringing your meals in.
This punk motherfucker Tilghman
running around acting righteous...
but he bringing shit in here,
steady slinging on the side.
Don't fret. All right?
It's nothing. I'm gonna take care of it.
The city won't take it?
No, it's Port Authority property.
It's state jurisdiction.
So it's MSP out of Pikesville.
Case needs real murder police.
You don't give a shit.
Just wanna fuck Rawls, don't you?
Absolutely. What can you give me?
-This is about fucking over your boss?
-If they don't eat the cases, then you will.
What do you need?
First of all,
how big was the false compartment?
13 by 7 by 7.
Okay, we got 13 adult females,
breathing at a normal to elevated rate...
that's 0.25 liters of oxygen per minute...
per victim.
-He's a doctor?
-A State Bureau of Mines.
-Minds?
-Mines.
Officer Tilghman,
could I parlay with you for a moment?
-Barksdale, right?
-Yeah.
-Listen, I want to know if you can help me--
-No.
-Pardon me?
-I said, no, motherfucker.
Off the steps.
What the fuck are you up to now?
You're deep into somebody's shit, McNulty.
I can tell.
This is bullshit.
Those computations were checked...
and confirmed by
the medical examiner's office.
They're accurate for time of death
to within a three-hour window.
Yeah, so you say.
Your man in the Marine Unit
did the measurements on the container.
I happen to know my man
in the Marine Unit intimately...
and he's, without a doubt,
the most swollen asshole...
in American law enforcement.
I am not eating 13 murders. No, sir.
If they were already dead
when the container hit the dock...
then they were murdered on board ship.
That means Baltimore County...
or Anne Arundel
on the other side of the bridge...
and if they're further down the bay, then you
fellows with the Coast Guard can take it.
This is not a city problem.
Talk amongst yourselves.
One of you is taking this case home tonight.
No, Bill.
The Atlantic Light passed the Key Bridge
at 2300 hours...
and laid up at anchor,
2,000 yards off Patapsco...
until 0600 hours, when it docked.
-By the map, that's Baltimore city.
-And that put the ship in your jurisdiction...
for the three-hour window
for the time of death.
Bill, you look like
you could use a good cup of coffee.
Mikey.
-What's up?
-No.
No, what?
No way, you little rat-faced piece of shit.
You fucked up the last two packages
I gave you.
Mikey, look man, that wasn't me.
You got money, Zig,
you can buy a little weight.
You got no money, go fuck yourself.
Mike, I thought we was friends.
Did you fuck up the last two packages?
-Sort of.
-Are you beat to shit?
-No.
-Take a walk, my friend.
-What's up, man?
-What's up, playboy?
That thing in Atlanta, settled for now.
So we got that, you know.
Good. I ain't call you down for that, man.
Called you down here 'cause we got a CO
in here with some bullshit.
-Who?
-Name is Tilghman.
He kin to that boy that Wee-Bey
dusted down over in that school lot.
He can't let go of that shit, neither.
Tilghman? Right.
Listen, Brianna reminded me, man.
We got promises we got to keep.
I know, I heard.
You need to get with Dee's girl.
Have her bring that young one
down here regular.
She need to step up
and do her fucking part.
All right.
How's Dee taking it?
I mean, he gonna do
what need to be done, man.
You know what I'm saying?
Dee need a little help every now and again.
You're not out of reach
or nothing like that, right?
-No, nothing like that.
-You sure?
-He's carrying a lot of weight for us, man.
-Stringer, he's family, man.
All right? He's family.
Come on, Jimmy. Take it to the head, baby.
Come on. Tell her you were first in line.
That's it.
There it is.
-One more, baby, come on.
-There you go.
-That's enough.
-No.
You gotta do all 14 of them bad boys...
one for every member of the dear family
you gave to Cole.
Here's to Ray Cole, a fine detective,
and a goodly man.
Jimmy, the look on Jay Landsman's face.
He nearly fucking cried.
And Rawls!
Rawls, I swear to God,
the man stayed in his office all day.
All afternoon.
He just stayed there with the door closed.
-Careful, you're giving me an erection.
-Come on now.
Motherfucker, you have outdone yourself
this time.
You ain't never coming back from this,
you know that.
Lester, what the fuck can they do to me
they haven't done?
I'm riding the goddamn boat.
Fuck it, I don't give a shit.
Here's to Jane Doe 13.
All right.
Eleven more years of whatever bullshit
they throw at me.
I'm gonna put in my papers,
take the pension and walk.
Eleven's a long time to be on the shelf.
Tell me about it, Mr. 13 years.
And four months.
Fuck it.
Chew you up, they gotta spit you back out.
-Fourteen.
-He did it.
-Fourteen.
-He did it.
Fuck.
Easy, motherfucker,
I ain't picking up that shit.
Go that way.
-Man, anybody still in there?
-They're keeping La-la.
He had an old warrant on him.
-For what?
-I don't know. Some traffic shit, man.
The bondsman's inside,
trying to get it all figured out.
Man, what the fuck
was this all about anyway?
-Jerking us around on the way to work.
-It's a beef I got with a police boss.
-Charlie Valchek's little pissant brother.
-You gotta get that taken care of, man.
-I mean, this shit is out of hand.
-I'm gonna take care of it.
Yeah, y'all need a lift?
-I'll see you.
-All right, talk to you.
That runt wants a war, he's got one.
Not supposed to be talking anyway.
-Bunk, Lester.
-Yeah.
You two winners are on the Jane Does.
What? We're not up, Jay.
We caught that double in Pimlico last week.
Cole's gonna take the double.
-You two got pussy in a can.
-Jay, that ain't right.
You know what ain't right?
Our squad has a negative clearance rate
for the year. A negative rate.
Now, I'm not saying
Ray Cole isn't a good detective.
But I need those 14 cases to go black...
so I got my best people on it.
Ray.
Lay it on them.
Name and number of the port cop
who processed the scene.
And the best of luck to you
in all your future endeavors, Detectives.
Motherfucker.
Beatrice Russell. She pretty at least?
Last night, you're too drunk to fuck.
Today, you're too hung over.
What's the most useless thing on a woman?
-What?
-A drunken lrishman.
But you're not really lrish, are you?
I had 14 shots of Jameson.
How's that for green?
You're green, all right.
You're also an idiot. Who does 14 shots?
You're a child, McNulty.
Show up at my door at 2:00 a.m. again
without invitation...
-I will call the cops.
-Why would you wanna do that?
Jimmy.
Am I your girlfriend? No. Your wife? No.
Your soul mate? No.
What the fuck am l, Jimmy?
We're good together.
Answer the question.
I've been pretty honest with you.
My wife wants to put it back together again,
I'm gonna go for it, right?
You know, what with the kids and all....
You got any aspirin?
For Christ's sake, Ronnie, I'm dying in here.
A real police department
would have an elevator.
So you Russell? Bunk Moreland.
Lester Freamon.
I'm still on hold with the Coast Guard,
Delaware River Detachment.
What do we know?
Atlantic Light is in Philly,
heading for Port of Elizabeth tonight.
-I'm trying to get them to hold her.
-Anyone from your CID working this?
Nope. I heard there's a big argument
over jurisdiction...
and your colonel made everybody mad.
-All you get is me.
-Still on hold?
We can call this in from the road.
You're with City Homicide?
-You must know Jimmy McNulty.
-Yeah, he's dead to us.
Gentlemen, make yourselves at home.
I've seen worse.
It's leased by the Highway Authority,
but we can use it for an off-site.
-Furnace work?
-It does.
And the phone lines.
You'll need window units
if you're here come summer...
but somehow I got a feeling...
that you gents will put together a case
quicker than that.
Now, this here...
is my district investigator,
Roland Pryzbylewski.
Kid's a prodigy.
Anything you need from me, you go to him.
Gentlemen, the target is Frank Sobotka...
and anyone Frank Sobotka
does his dirt with.
Roland will fill you in on the details.
Good hunting.
So who signs the overtime slips?
Son of a bitch.
You are a fucking thief, aren't you?
-This is where our taxes go.
-I do good work, don't l?
Let's get it on the fucking can now.
Horseface, you son of a bitch.
Christ, I'm gonna bust the only nut I got left.
Ain't no heavier than the pallets
we usually handle.
Finishing touch, boys.
Bon voyage.
There she goes.
This area's restricted. Yes, sir, no problem.
-Amir, why don't we sail?
-They're holding the ship.
-Who?
-Coast Guard, the Americans.
Why?
Fuck, Sergei, you almost break my hand.
Bring him up!
-Have a good day, Officer.
-Okay, I'll see you.
Now get up in there.
Last call before lock-down.
Make it snappy now.
-How you like that?
-It's good, baby, it's beautiful.
Nice. Smooth.
Most def, man.
Man, watch your back, be good, baby.
-What up, man?
-Yeah, he left that in here.
It's his.
-So how you doing?
-All right.
Yeah?
Me and you gonna need to talk.
-So who's on board?
-Thirty-eight in the crew, 14 are Yemeni.
Eight are Sri Lankan.
There are five Filipinos and the rest
are from here, there, and back again.
-Anybody speak English?
-What you're asking them about...
I'll be amazed if any of them
manages a word.
-Where's your captain?
-At the Coast Guard office.
Angry as hell because we're due
on a New Jersey pier tomorrow morning.
You ain't gonna make it.
I gotta tell you, every day that you hold us
costs the shipping agent $100,000.
-The Atlantic Light is a huge enterprise.
-The Atlantic Light is a crime scene.
Don't try to play tough guy.
I'm not the one getting my ass kicked.
Talk to me!
Tell me what I need to know.
Get him up.
-Talk about the girls.
-No girls, nothing.
No English.
You no speak English,
but you know how to run?
Why you run from ship?
What the fuck that suppose to mean?
They got him in Philadelphia.
He jumped when he found out
the Coast Guard was gonna hold the ship.
-What is he?
-Sergei says he looks like an Arab.
He don't know nothing.
But you kept hitting him anyway.
Get his clothes.
If you don't mind, I'm gonna have one.
-Come on, let's talk.
-No English.
Tell me what happened to the girls?
No speak.
What then? What do you speak?
Come on, talk to me, friend.
Turkish?
You got that little hook on your nose.
Don't worry, patrioti.
I got nothing against the Turks.
That's the old world. This is the new.
Sam.
-I don't know nothing about--
-You know.
And you're going to tell me about it, too.
After that...
you're done, I give you my word.
We popped the can to let them take a bath.
Get some fresh air.
You gotta understand, my crew,
they pulling on their pootsos for weeks.
These girls, they looked pretty good.
-Katalavenis?
-Yes.
The men had cash to spend.
I admit it, I saw chance for business,
but that was all.
What happened?
One of the puttanas decided
she didn't want to be a puttana no more.
This one guy got rough with her.
The whore died.
The other ones saw.
I didn't know what to do.
-You kill one, then you kill them all.
-No, that was another man.
Another man, what man?
The one girl...
they saw, they knew.
Relax.
I gave you my word.
-Watch your shoes.
-Goddamn Turko.
Bleeds like a lamb.
In a year, each whore would bring
a quarter million. What is it?
$4 million.
Gone.
Malaka.
Anyway, there will be other girls.
This one...
no fingerprints.
-No face.
-That's not a problem.
Yo, J, what up, son, where you been?
I ain't been nowhere, T.
Just laying low, man.
Now watch, you gonna see
Darnell's little brother...
come on out with that laundry basket.
-And the take's in the basket?
-Once in the afternoon, and one at night.
Always the same laundry basket.
How you know?
That money got to come out somehow, man.
So, we ain't got to blast our way
to the top floor.
We just wait till they're in the street
with their shit.
We gonna do them tonight, you heard?
After it get dark.
Just like you say.
Put the basket down now, put it down!
-Fuck, I said put the basket down!
-Easy girl, chill.
You all niggers, you got caught slipping.
Sorry it had to go down like this, baby,
because your ass is cute.
But you got got.
Nice, very nice.
Bitches!
Now, that's something
you don't see every day.
No English.
Kunta Kinte...
yabba dabba dabba doo.
Mishy gishy gushy gushy
mishy meshy mushy, motherfucker.
Negro, you cannot travel
halfway around the world...
and not speak any motherfucking English.
English, motherfucker!
Two missing, and the rest
ain't saying shit we can understand.
I tried to tell you,
with the questions you all are asking.
We step off ship,
English is once again heard, right?
Pretty much, yeah.
Here's what's left of Osman.
He was with us since Trieste.
Choksey took all his gear when he jumped.
-You get a lot of guys jumping ship?
-Some.
Usually after a pay,
which we made in Norfolk.
Choksey actually asked for an advance,
which we did using ship's scrip.
Nothing here in the way of ID papers
or money. He grabbed that at least.
Anybody else ask for any advances
while you were at sea?
-More than usual.
-Yeah?
A few of them were coming back
day after day, scripting more and more cash.
We figured they were
gambling down in the holds.
And maybe not, right?
The can with the girls was in Bay 9
on the bottom, outside.
-Did you check that bay?
-I did.
It's full of cans for export,
loaded in Hampton Roads.
No sign of anything
except a fresh stack of containers.
I'm not gonna lie to you. If you hold us
another day and bring in interpreters...
they're still not gonna say a thing.
The unwritten rule is that what happens
below decks stays below decks.
Sit up, Nicky,
we got paying customers waiting.
Ashley, sit down.
You think I cut it too short?
Just don't make me look funny.
Ashley's preschool called.
-They want more money?
-Just what we owe them.
-And her teacher says that--
-Teacher?
-They ain't nothing but baby-sitters.
-Whatever.
Ashley's been talking in class
about how Mom and Dad don't live together.
Who asks her about that?
No one asks, she just talks.
Kids notice stuff like that.
They talk, you know?
By the time she's in elementary school,
it's going to be an issue.
Time she gets that far,
we'll be under the same roof.
You said that last Christmas.
Christ, Aimee!
You pulling it out or cutting it?
Listen, Nicky.
You want to go get to someplace better,
I'm with you.
You wanna keep on like this,
then I got to rethink stuff.
Do what you feel.
As soon as I start getting more hours,
the first thing I do is get my own place.
You wanna move in with me, great.
You don't want to,
at least I did my goddamn best.
You want a streak or something?
I could put a little purple in it.
Yeah, and right after that...
I'll just go ahead
and stick my tongue up some guy's ass.
Got you good, huh?
You think?
No, I mean, not really.
Not if Evidence Control
is the posting you want.
-Sorry, Lieutenant.
-Fuck it, right?
We brought in the case at least.
Heard you were on the boat.
Ain't so bad.
How's Kima?
She's inside.
Asset Forfeiture.
And she's second year pre-law.
Housecat. That ain't her.
-This coming back?
-Yeah.
It's the Gant case right there.
Nathan looked over our weak shit...
told me to go find Omar this week
or she drops charges.
-You got a line on him lately?
-I haven't a clue.
Last thing I did
was put him on a bus to New York.
You keep your head low, Lieutenant.
A year or two,
you'll be back in their favor, right?
Year or two, and I'll be a lawyer.
I got 22 years in.
I'm putting the papers in this week.
You're gone?
What the hell am I doing down here
with a law degree, right?
You take care, McNulty.
You, too.
Kimmy, all I'm trying to say is,
if you'd stop lighting up all the damn time...
-maybe you'd understand--
-I'm gonna light up regardless.
-It took us too long.
-You know I love you, but if your ass...
don't get to finishing counting
all my motherfucking money....
-Shit, you know I love you, but damn.
-Almost five.
We got them motherfuckers good.
Let's see them motherfuckers slip next time.
Who the fuck is you?
-Omar come a-calling.
-Omar? Shit.
Ain't that nigger dead?
I heard them project niggers lit him up.
No, I heard they ran his ass up
out of this town.
Spread the word, darling, Omar back.
Look at the way
Crutchfield spelled "prostrate."
Look at it.
"The above referenced victim
was prostate on the floor."
"Prostate on the floor."
That's a victim, all right.
That hurts bad.
I love this job, I do.
-You want to hear about Philly, Sarge?
-Just the dirty parts.
The ship's a dead end.
The cargo bay that held our container...
is full of new boxes,
nothing to recover there.
And all them sailors, they lied to us
in every language past English.
Gibbering motherfuckers.
Sailing up the coast right now,
laughing at us.
Is that it?
Two guys jumped ship.
We'll put out teletypes...
in case that has
anything to do with anything.
One of them left his gear, and we kept that.
-Sounds like some weak-ass shit to me.
-Because it is.
But your suspect
had to be on the boat, right?
And your boat has sailed.
Jay, what the fuck were we supposed to do?
Hold the ship while we chat up
a crew of 40 in 53 dialects? Come on.
If that isn't the plan, what is?
-Officer....
-Russell.
I am informed that you are detailed
to this case...
as a liaison with the port police.
I also understand
that you are the only help...
that your department is sending.
That so?
Although there is some small charm
to a woman in uniform...
the fact remains
we work plainclothes in Homicide.
Which is not to say
that the clothes need be plain.
For you, I would suggest some pantsuits,
perhaps muted in color.
Something to offset Det. Moreland's
pinstriped lawyerly affectations...
and the brash, tweedy impertinence
of Det. Freamon.
Rawls is watching on this one.
Let's at least pretend we got a fucking clue.
Tweedy impertinence?
-I like that.
-You know what I'm saying?
-It's not here, Major.
-I can see that. Where is it?
The Flex Squad used it last Tuesday.
The vehicle log says
they parked it at 22:00 hours...
returning the keys to the OIC.
-And?
-We have the keys.
But not the van?
Are you telling me that a fully equipped...
$1 20,000 surveillance van...
assigned to the southeastern district
cannot be located?
-Around the world....
-In 880 days.
-Do we have a plan?
-A plan?
-For targeting this guy, Sobotka.
-I don't know.
Maybe find out where his union hangs...
go down there with a CI or two,
make some hand-to-hands.
-How about some DNRs on his phones?
-DNRs?
See who he's calling,
and look for any kind of pattern.
Hand-to-hands for now, I think.
600 series, and that's it.
That's right.
This is too nice a block for a prison guard.
Shit, you couldn't pay me enough
to work in no prison, man.
Yeah, right, no.
I want you to drop all the cellular joints.
-Yeah, all of them, Nokia, Motorola.
-Listen to Stringer play Wall Street.
All right, so call me, yeah.
String, why you so down
on the phone companies, man?
While back, I took a stroll through the Pit.
I saw that kid
we got running things down there, Poot.
He got the cell phone I gave him
for the business, right there on his hip...
but the nigger got another cell phone
that only ring when the pussy called.
Now, if this no-count nigger
got two cell phones...
how the fuck you gonna sell
any more of them motherfuckers?
That's market saturation.
Look here.
That Tilghman right there.
-Dressed like a prison guard and all.
-Yeah, I see him.
Steel door.
The boy on the step is all, though.
Stump is sitting in the front room window,
staring at the damn television.
-You all could see that from the step?
-There in his damn drawers.
Shut up, dog!
Rat make that trash, he home free.
Junk better get in closer
if he want a shot at him.
I got $20 on Mr. Rat. Anyone fade me?
Move along. Come on, get there.
$100 says it ain't over.
Shit, I got to take easy money.
What the fuck?
-Motherfucker.
-Sounds about over now, though.
How the hell you know
what the rat gonna do?
Junk do know his varmints.
Yeah.
What's wrong with you, boy?
Look, I done told you before, man.
Those two babies don't move me that way.
If I come up with a plan
to do Stump without them...
you cut them loose?
Now you gone and got strategic on me?
We do like last time,
and wait for him to come out.
Only problem is,
Stump live in that rat hole, baby.
So, he ain't got to bring the cash out.
See what I'm saying?
Then we charge in, guns a-blazing.
Steel door, right?
What's it gonna take
for you to be convinced, man?
I don't bag no babies.
What you think?
You gonna have to do better than that.
Indeed.
Thinking, maybe do a quarter this time,
if it's not too much.
That a problem?
No.
I'm just saying, you back right quick with it.
It ain't like them motherfuckers
got anything else to do up in there, right?
-The shit is everyday, man.
-Sounds right. It count right, too?
Boy'll bring it to you outside.
There's Tilghman.
So, his shit coming from Butchie then?
-All right.
-Lying Butchie.
-Santa's elves are short.
-Santa's elves aren't real.
The elves in Lord of the Rings
are, like, real elves.
-Real elves?
-They should be short, then.
Dwarves are short, hobbits are short.
Elves are tall and immortal.
If you weren't too scared to watch the movie
then you'd know all about it, doofus.
Bite me, dickbreath.
-Sean, knock it off.
-He started it.
Okay, upstairs right away,
brush your teeth, pajamas.
It's a school night, Sean.
Can I tuck them in?
My lawyer's gonna be
sending you something in the mail.
-You're kidding.
-It's not a divorce, it's an agreement.
-A separation agreement.
-A separation agreement?
Just read it. Okay? It's for the both of us.
It's to protect the both of us.
This is about what?
It's just....
You should just read it, okay?
Okay.
Another goddamn day we put our cards up
and get nothing.
-Zig, I don't know why I fucking bother.
-Yeah, tell me about it.
One ship today, nothing yesterday.
Wait for Thursday,
a couple ROIROs hit the berth...
and congratu-fucking-lations,
you grab a day.
Friday's quiet again.
Look at it this way, you know,
at least you get the day off.
Days off is the fucking point, Zig.
I can't keep waking up in the morning
not knowing if I'm gonna get paid.
I got a kid, right? I got a fucking kid...
and a girl that wants
to get married, for Christ's sake.
What the fuck you wanna get married for?
Not saying I do.
But fuck if I even could,
without no pot to piss in.
Aimee is like, "What's the plan," you know?
And I'm down here
wondering if I'm gonna get a day or two.
Aimee's sister broke up with Petie, right?
That's your problem, Zig,
one of them, anyway.
You let that thing of yours lead you around.
You know me, whiskey, cock, and 5:00.
-Just get off me.
-Nicky, look.
If it's money that you're worried about, shit.
Let's pool a few dollars together.
I'll get us hooked up
with a little llello, you know...
turn it around this morning,
we make more money before lunch...
than we can down here all week.
I ain't standing out on no corner
like some fucking project nigger...
I ain't standing out on no corner
like some fucking project nigger...
so that I get popped for pocket change.
Fuck that shit, Zig. Seriously.
-What are you gonna do?
-I'll think of something.
1 1900 on that one.
We're looking for 14580, by the manifest.
Can't be, the numbers don't go that high.
You had to figure it'd be this way,
the way the port works.
Yeah?
Why have anything
other than fake companies...
and addresses on the manifest
if you're moving a can with contraband?
And on the other end, too, right?
You can work it back through customs,
but chances are...
this box wasn't picked up anywhere
near this Rue de Rivoli address...
in Le Havre, France.
Hell, there might not even
be a Rue de Rivoli in that town.
A can full of dead girls,
sent to nowhere from nowhere.
-He been good business for me, though.
-Yeah?
Two, three quarters a week.
Mr. Tilghman's money always right,
always on time.
That's why we coming to you for the setup.
-You the man to him.
-I'm just saying.
I know, the money, and you know
we gonna find a way to make that right.
But like I said, I'm not asking for myself.
Now I'm asking for my man.
-Avon's call?
-Wouldn't be here otherwise.
-Avon is Avon.
-Always.
He probably gonna roll past tomorrow.
That'll work.
You see what I'm saying, right?
It makes no sense to bring the girls
all this way and then kill them.
You go all that way to dump it on your boss,
and now you're worrying yourself.
-It's got me thinking is all.
-It's a little late for that, McNulty.
What connects the one girl in the water
with all the other ones in the can?
-If you're right and she isn't local, then--
-She's definitely not local.
The low level of mercury viscosity...
in the amalgam restorations
says Eastern Europe.
-If you say so.
-Trust me, she's not from Dundalk.
Eastern Europe?
Can you narrow it down some?
How's this? Three of the dead girls were
in Budapest, Hungary sometime last year.
How'd you know that?
They bought tits there.
Three of the girls had breast enhancements.
We looked at the bags during the post.
We pulled the lot and serial numbers...
and they trace back to an outpatient
plastic surgery clinic in Budapest.
Would you call them?
Might pull an ID from patient records.
The best they could tell me is the implants
were used some time this fall.
Three girls, three surgeries,
same clinic, right?
-What else?
-What else?
-Fuck you, Jimmy McNulty.
-Okay, you're a fucking god.
There's no one in the game
who can stand in your light, Dr. Frazier, sir.
You have to admit that whole
Budapest thing was a hell of a pull.
-Where's the paperwork on this cat?
-I got it over here.
So go on, what else?
Not much, except the swabs show
that at least seven of the girls in the box...
had vaginal intercourse
within 24 hours of death.
Two had anal and six came back positive
on the oral.
You tell Cole about all this?
I sent the findings off to Homicide,
but Cole ain't on the case, brother.
-No, who is?
-It's your man, Bunk.
And that older guy, his partner, they ate it.
Thanks.
I told you, I brought you a soda.
That better?
Now, look at me.
Don't let those mean boys see you crying.
-Okay?
-Okay.
I'll take care of you.
Mr. Stump!
Them boys been teasing Chantelle again.
You know it.
-Morning.
-Morning.
-Bobby, how you been?
-Not bad.
-Working the tier today?
-Yeah, on J.
-Have a good one.
-Yeah, you, too.
You happy now, bitch?
How was I gonna know
Landsman would pull Cole...
and stick you guys?
You right here with them?
-What did he call Cole?
-"Collateral damage."
I'm feeling pretty damn collateral myself,
I got to say.
Which is why I went to see Dr. Frazier
and work some things out in my head.
Officer McNulty could've
paid this thing no mind, but no.
When his friends are suffering,
he bleeds, too.
Did you see the preliminary?
Positives for oral, vaginal, anal.
No IDs, no passports, no visas,
no real money.
And they're coming
across the water like that.
-Yeah.
-McNulty has a theory.
-Does he now?
-You deductive motherfucker, you.
So he's gonna wander in here
with some Johnny-come-lately bullshit...
about how these girls
are all coming over here as prostitutes...
talking about how if they ain't got the cash
to travel better than a container ship...
then they sure don't have the money
for a plastic surgeon.
Then he's gonna say something
about that one in the water...
being tossed off the ship
after she's already dead from a beat-down.
But why she got beat?
He's gonna ask us that, like we don't know.
He's gonna answer his own question,
saying her swabs are negative, right?
Fuck or fight with all them sailor boys,
and she fought.
So, it got a little rough.
She gets banged around,
she comes up dead.
And then somebody panics,
tosses her in the harbor overnight...
before the ship ties up.
But the other girls saw.
So now, the other girls,
they get told to get back in that can.
And our man, to cover this shit up...
he gets up on top
and bangs down the air pipe.
-Anything else you want to tell us?
-When did you guys get there?
Yesterday, when the ship's first mate
told us that while the ship was at sea...
half the crew came to him
for advances on their salary.
They had one hell of a dice game
going on below deck...
or the boys popped them girls
out of that can.
You talk to the crew?
-In what language?
-Crime scene?
-Nope.
-Anybody missing?
Two guys jumped ship.
One in Philly, one in Norfolk.
But that shit happens all the time,
apparently.
-Got yourself a hell of a case.
-Fuck you very much.
You know what happens to all the girls
if you don't ID them?
Anatomy Board as medical cadavers.
Then a crematorium.
Then that mass grave out at Crownsville.
That bothers you?
Yeah, a little.
Me, too.
-Thanks for hosting this, Father.
-Hope it helps.
You guys have really done
the background on this.
This is more presence
than the port unions have shown in years.
-Is the governor listening?
-It's now or never for us.
And not just the grain pier,
but with the dredging.
I don't care
what the Corps of Engineers' study says.
-The fact remains--
-Excuse me, Bobby.
I just need him to work
the other side of the room on something.
You're wasting time here.
Bobby's District 7, which is middle river...
which means every vote he gets
is somebody with some port connection.
He's a good vote, no matter what we do.
The guys you need to be working
are the guys...
who wouldn't have come
if we hadn't been throwing money at them.
-Like who?
-Like John Carney, from Anne Arundel.
Liz Tobin, from Montgomery.
Clay Davis, from over Westside.
Keep hold of them,
some of your stuff stays in the budgets.
-And they're with us?
-Carney is pretty firm.
Liz will stay solid if the environmentalists
don't get to her.
Clay Davis...that guy, you wanna make sure
you're the last man out of the room.
What do you mean?
I mean, we've given forty large
to the Westside Democratic Organization...
and this motherfucker still has his hand out.
and this motherfucker still has his hand out.
We spent $40,000 on that guy?
Worth it, if he lets your projects
sail through the conference committee.
-Forty fuckin' thousand?
-Am I your lobbyist? Are you paying me?
Trust me. With the players in this room...
the presiding officers and a little help
from the governor's office...
we might squeeze some things out
this session.
Now, go make nice.
-Senator Davis.
-Excuse me.
Hey, partner.
People tell me
it just might be a good year for the port.
Might be.
You all have been stepping up
in a lot of ways.
Hope it continues like that.
You all making friends in a lot of places?
We're friendly guys.
So they came back murders?
I admit, I didn't see that coming at all.
Who could've seen that?
For whoever was having
these girls brought over...
-the net loss is in the millions.
-That much?
One of these girls on the circuit,
going club-to-club on the East Coast...
can bring in half a million
over the next two years.
And that's just
for club work and prostitution.
-So somebody messed up.
-In a big way.
You guys called it.
No such address in Le Havre.
Or for that matter, anywhere in Brittany.
The name and ID of the driver
who signed the bill of lading...
doesn't correspond
to their motor vehicle database.
Dead ends either way.
The girls, they know
what they're coming over for?
Some do.
Some get told they're gonna dance,
or be secretaries.
You gotta understand, they're coming
from places that don't have much.
Romania, Moldavia, Russia, Albania.
40,000 or 50,000 undocumented women
working in the US alone.
50,000? Jesus.
They need a whole new agency
just to police them.
What they need is a union.
-To Stan and Kate.
-Stan and Kate.
Happy anniversary!
Thanks a lot.
-Good time here?
-Yeah.
How is my detail coming?
Lt. Grayson is on top of things, right?
Burrell recommended him.
Said he was really good at property crimes.
-It's gonna take a while.
-You think?
Why? What are you doing?
Not much.
We got no DNRs up.
We're not looking at any union assets.
We're not collecting tag numbers
or anything.
We're not looking for patterns at all.
And that's the thing.
I'm trying to tell you
about the Barksdale thing.
If you go in with the idea
you're gonna eat around the edges...
you never get a meal.
With Barksdale, Daniels and Freamon
had us pulling all kinds of stuff.
DMV records, phone logs,
corporate charter stuff...
political campaign contributions.
If Burrell didn't
break the case down so fast...
we would've brought back $3 or $4 million
in downtown real estate...
not to mention the money
those guys gave to political campaigns.
We were deep, really deep.
I've been trying to tell you.
If it wasn't for Burrell,
that would've been a major case.
-String.
-You know, I just came to check up on you.
-See how you holding it down.
-I'm all right.
-Where the little man at?
-I just put him down.
You want something to drink?
Do D'Angelo know what he's missing?
I'm sure he do.
You just reminded me about something.
Tag's still on it.
He bought it
before he got stopped in Jersey.
Never been worn.
You know,
it's a shame to let things go to waste.
You know,
you can give away the man's clothes...
but that don't make him gone, right?
I ain't forget him.
You ain't been to see him
much neither, though.
-It's been hard.
-It's been hard?
It's been hard on him, too.
A lot of bad things
caught up in a man's head...
when he's on lock-down.
Man need to see his baby mama.
Need to see his child, too.
Only one thing he needs to be secure about,
and if not...
then he might start thinking
he can't do that time...
and then we all got problems.
You understand me?
How you set here?
The apartment, the car,
the money's all right?
-It's good.
-It's good?
I know it's good.
But you know what I'm talking about, right?
We all got a job to do, and your job
is to let D'Angelo know we still family.
It's important.
I'm an XL.
No doubt.
-Your round, Jimmy.
-Jesus.
I'm gonna owe the baby-sitter
half my salary...
if I don't throw myself out of here right now.
-You got kids?
-Two.
-Daddy working late, too?
-Not a day in his goddamn life.
You barely made a dent.
Good night, gents.
-Good night.
-Good night.
-What's that about?
-I don't know.
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
-Solve the fucking case?
-Not a shot.
-I'm gonna give this one a name.
-A name?
She's not going
out to Crownsville, this one.
-Not on me, she's not.
-So what are you gonna do with her?
Pay for a box and a mortician
and ship her back to Bumfuck, Europe?
No, I'm gonna find where her people at.
How does that matter?
You see, this is that Catholic shit, Jimmy.
This is that little altar-boy-guilt talking.
What the fuck I got to feel guilty about?
Let me count the ways.
Good morning, Major.
What the....
Wilmington? Son of a bitch!
-Frank?
-Ring, how's it hanging?
Not so good.
-Not right now.
-Yeah?
I'm late on my dues. You know that, right?
You're late, yeah.
And I'm parking that piece-of-shit Buick
two blocks from the house...
hoping for a lazy repo man.
That bad?
I know you ain't been getting hours,
it's been slow.
Five days last month.
-That's all.
-Is that all?
Look, I got to shit or get off the pot here.
-I'm gonna go with 47.
-Do me a favor.
Frank, you been fair,
I ain't saying otherwise.
It's just there's 60 checkers above me
with more seniority, and that's all she wrote.
Do me a favor.
Go down Clement Street tonight...
give this to Dolores,
tell her you need a beer and a shot on me.
Just do that much.
You have a round on me, you go home.
You wanna come in tomorrow, tell me
you're going with 47, I'm with you on it.
Thanks.
Lane 4, you got a trucker's code and tag.
Pick me a winner, Johnny.
-You're ugly enough to be a teamster.
-Lick me, you whore.
It'll be up on wheels. K-row, slot 1 22.
Roger that.
Look, misdelivery.
Can was supposed to go ashore at Norfolk.
-Yeah, where you want it?
-I'm gonna need it on wheels at K-1 22.
My man'll pick it up there. Thanks, Horse.
Wrong box, misdelivery.
No need to count, Butch.
-My shit always right.
-Hearing.
Hearing is believing.
Boy'll meet you outside
when you ready to roll.
I'm ready now.
No, dog. Not from me you don't.
Later, Butchie.
Your man Avon ain't got no flex.
Afraid not.
Who you like better?
Ultimate Spiderman or regular Spiderman?
-What's the difference?
-See, I'll have to teach you everything.
Excuse me, gents.
What's up, man? How you liking the library?
It'll do.
It's easy on you.
I know a lot of people put in for the gig,
but the gig go to you.
Funny how that go.
So you want me to say thanks?
You ain't got to say shit.
But you need to take heed
of what can be done for you...
if you keep your head straight.
You're just full of favors, ain't you?
You shut your mouth and open your mind...
and you ain't gonna be doing
but a small piece of this 20.
Just like I'm only gonna do
a year or two on this seven.
-Feel me?
-I got priors.
Best I can do is half.
That's 10. I can count to 10.
Some shit is coming down, Dee, okay?
You need to think.
You need to trust,
and you need to get your head right.
Man, my head is where I want it.
-You look dusty lately.
-So what?
What, you my mom up in here now?
That's the weak man's road you're taking.
I ain't never seen you as weak.
Look, I'm just, you know,
every now and again.
That's all I got
to get my head up out of this shithole.
Ain't no more than that?
Because if that's all it is...
you should be able
to give it a rest for a few days.
-Because it ain't no thing, right?
-Yeah, it ain't no thing.
Then you gonna do that?
I'm asking you, man, out of love.
There's always love, Dee.
All right. Yeah.
A few days. Sure, a few days.
Right.
All right, what have you got?
All digital. Four megapix,
16 megs of memory...
3X optical, 4X digital zoom.
That's brand new on the market.
That's the Cadillac of cameras right there.
-How many?
-400.
-You are talking a big number.
-That's showtime. This ain't the WNBA.
I'm thinking with these features,
this brand...
I can get, maybe, $350 each at retail.
-All right, cool.
-Nope, not cool.
$500.
Yeah, I've been calling
some of the local chain stores.
You know, Best Buy, Circuit City.
This model goes for $550,
$500 when they're on sale.
Okay, $500.
-Times 400 units, that comes to--
-That's $200,000.
What are you looking for?
Twenty percent. There's three of us.
I want a woman with thin ankles.
But I'm going to go home tonight,
and there's going to be my wife.
Eight percent. $16,000.
That's over $5,000 apiece
for you and your friends.
$20,000. Upfront.
Because I like you.
Look at that.
It's a Kodak moment in the house.
I got to run this by my people.
They okay it, I'm going to give you a call.
All right, cool.
-Did you see that?
-Yeah.
You gonna insult my ace,
you check-and-raise piece of shit?
-Fuck you, Augie, see it or fold.
-I'll see it and raise you back.
-Talk to me, Augie.
-Ten-hut.
Where's the lieutenant?
He's on the street.
I'm not a politician.
I wouldn't even know how to count votes.
Maybe they know it's our time.
Tony.
Too soon to call you Commissioner?
Excuse me one sec.
-You sent me humps.
-Major?
You sent me a detail of humps, Ervin.
-We can discuss this tomorrow.
-No, I think we discuss it now...
or I'm gonna walk in there and tell Santoni...
to vote against this goddamn coronation.
And more than that, I'm gonna talk
some shit to some of my friends...
about what happened
at the end of the Barksdale case.
You hear me on that?
The Barksdale case
was a successful prosecution.
Up until our people
tried to chase the cash, maybe.
We have a quorum, I believe.
Council members can take their seats now.
Tell you what, Deputy.
You probably still got enough votes...
but I can make it uglier than you want it.
What do you want, Stan?
I want a real detail,
with real police and a real unit commander.
Fine, done.
Give me that black lieutenant
that did Barksdale.
Daniels put in his papers.
He's gone, out the door.
Did he meet the pension board yet?
I suggest you talk to the man.
-I'll do what I can.
-Don't fuck with me, Erv.
I got as many friends
here in the hall as you do.
And with what I'm learning
about the Barksdale case...
I got all kinds of shit I can throw.
-Lock-down in 20.
-All right.
What's up, lce?
-You done with that Green Lantern?
-You can read it, but I want it back.
-You hit Dee?
-Dee ain't up.
Four hundred good cameras, Spiros.
Who brought them in?
The young stevedore, Niko,
and that idiot cousin of his.
And I think he uses, too.
Stefanos.
I don't give a damn nothing about him.
Listen, I'm paying 10 cents
on the dollar for the cameras.
We're going to clear $180,000.
-What about Niko?
-He's smart.
Make the deal.
What the hell's wrong with you tonight?
-What?
-You're acting normal.
You know what, Dolores?
I made money today.
Yeah? What ship was in?
Hey, Zig.
Shot and a beer, Dolores.
Frank Sobotka says I needed it.
Thanks.
-What's this?
-Your change. Or so says Frank Sobotka.
-Sure?
-It ain't mine, for Christ's sake.
If you don't take it, someone else is gonna.
Your pop's a good man, Zig.
Yo, up here!
T.C., what's up?
What's going on?
-They falling out, four that I seen.
-What?
What the fuck is going on?
Bad package. Hot shots.
What's up?
Great view.
Harbor, I mean.
It's fucking picturesque, is what it is.
Every morning I ask myself,
"Is today the day I drive down...
"to Fort Armistead, stare out at the harbor?"
No, I figure eventually,
if I mind my own business...
Uncle Frank will wake my ass up
at 7:00 in the morning...
tell me to get my ass down there
for some mysterious fucking reason.
Good anchorage, good cranes...
good railroads, close to l-95.
Lot of people ready to work, right?
That's my fucking town.
Except, the thing is,
we're another 1 10 miles...
for any ship coming up
from Hampton Roads. An extra day.
So why come?
Unless you know your cargo's
gonna move...
fast and clean through the port.
Why offload in Baltimore,
except that a Baltimore gang...
can turn your ship around
faster than any other port...
and will make sure your cargo...
all your cargo, gets where it needs to go
faster than anywhere else.
Like you guys never stole nothing
back in the day.
We ain't back in the day, Nicky.
When was the last time
you saw trucks backed up for three miles...
outside Patapsco terminal?
If it wasn't for the car-ships,
we would be starving.
The cameras come back.
I'm serious.
They come back today, we tell the shipper
we lost the can in the stacks.
They're gone. We turned them over already.
To who?
You know the Tasco line's a cunt hair away
from taking their business down to Norfolk.
-I don't need this shit right now.
-I do, Uncle Frank, I need the money.
-You ain't hearing me!
-What? You think this shit is easy?
You think it's fucking easy?
You try living on five or six days a month.
See how fast it puts you on your ass.
I am on my ass, Uncle Frank.
You need money, you come to me.
Frankie Sobotka is
Father fucking Christmas...
on the docks lately.
-No doubt, his pockets are full.
-You think it's for me?
Is that what you think?
It ain't about me, Nick!
I know, I'm sorry.
You got Ziggy mixed up in this.
Jesus, Nick, what the fuck are you thinking?
Me and Zig are gonna talk on this
long and hard.
Come on, let's go to work.
How much?
Twenty.
-Three-way split.
-Who's the inside man?
You don't know?
Fuck you then, I ain't no snitch.
Nobody should flash too much money.
You know that much, right?
Yeah.
Toxicology's coming back positive
for strychnine.
10%, 12%. It's pretty well laced.
This was intentional?
That's the ME's call, but I've seen
street packages cut all the time...
with all kinds of chemicals.
You don't use too much,
you give a weak package some kick.
People start thinking you're high-grade,
when what you got is...
stepped-on trash
with a little bit of rat poison mixed in.
Too much rat poison,
you got people falling out, like we got.
Be nice to have a few answers
for those reporters.
What do they wanna know?
How it got in, what we're doing, the usual.
It got in like everything gets in.
If you can't win
the war on drugs in a prison...
where the hell you gonna win it? I ask you.
Listen, if it were one or two dead,
it would fade.
But five in one night,
and eight more in the infirmary?
We need to show the flag on this.
What I'm gonna need is for you all
to wheel and deal.
What do you mean?
If this case gets made from an informant...
and you're gonna have
a couple dozen of them...
if you're ready to shave some years.
Colonel.
-Jimmy.
-Winona.
Gilligan, little buddy.
Don't you have a job?
Ouch!
I smell fresh police work.
Okay, be like that.
You got some paper from inside the can?
A letter, couple of envelopes,
some scraps of stuff?
Yeah, everything's down
in your evidence control.
-You got the submission slips?
-He does.
-Lester.
-You want to pull all of it?
Hold it.
Before you start dancing
with your Jane Doe...
I'm gonna need a little something from you
on the Gant case.
I got a full set of llene Nathan's teeth marks
on my hind parts.
-No problem, I got you covered.
-You found Omar?
I never lost him, my friend.
-He's got Omar?
-Bullshit.
Who's Omar?
My papers are in.
They are.
You want out, you're out.
But I'm offering to clean the slate here.
-You and me.
-Why?
The council vote is next week,
after which I'm upstairs.
Now, if I'm gonna give myself a chance...
to make my mark on this place,
I'll need good people.
People you can trust.
And you ain't that?
All right. You're a snake.
But you seem to know your business.
I'm taking the bar exam in a month.
Why not put it off for a year or two...
Ieave the department
with a major's pension?
Scalise is gonna retire this summer.
You do me a good turn
on this detail in southeast...
and you'll have that posting.
Why would you do that?
I value you, Cedric.
You're arrogant and disloyal.
But maybe, given time,
you'll find a way to shine.
-What's the detail?
-Drug case, probably.
My sense of it is that Stan Valchek has got...
some personal issues with somebody
in one of the port unions.
He thinks they've got too much money.
And so, being Valchek, he gets a detail.
That it? Pretty thin.
I don't care if you make a case
for Valchek or not.
I do care that the old Polack
comes away from it...
feeling he got his money's worth.
Valchek asked for me by name, didn't he?
You two are trading horses
and you need me in the corral.
How about this?
If I bring in the case...
you make the detail permanent
as a major case unit...
within CID.
Fair enough.
Just keep Valchek stroked
and make sure you bring in...
-a drug case or two.
-One other thing.
A promotion and the promise
of a specialized unit isn't enough?
I choose my own people.
Fuck me once, shame on you.
-Fuck me twice--
-Make a list.
Give it to Rawls. He'll pull who you want.
The shit do not make sense.
Some of them wasn't about nothing.
I mean, Tae? Lizard? lf it was a hotshot...
they were after
some real lightweight motherfucks.
Yo, Dee, you want any Silver Surfers?
They tossing shit Tae had in his cell, man.
Whoever load that shit up
didn't know what he was doing.
My boy down the infirmary say the shit
was more rat poison than it was dope.
Fucking-A right.
Jane Doe, number five.
Five.
What's up, baby?
Not here, put it away.
Shot and a beer, darling.
Kept one for yourself, did you?
Them Japs, they make a nice little camera,
they do.
-You even got film in that bitch?
-No, it's digital.
I know it's digital, so what?
So, no film, look,
there's a computer chip inside.
You take that off,
you load the pictures onto the computer.
Thanks.
Ziggy.
Don't spread no cash around
for a while, all right?
Hell, no.
I might get a new clutch plate
put in Princess is all.
-Also, your father knows.
-How does he know?
Horse saw us, right?
Fuck me, he told?
How long has Horse been tight
with your pop? Of course he told.
He's pissed, Zig. He ain't happy.
What did you say?
I told him we already
turned the cameras around...
and after a while, he stopped yelling.
At you, maybe.
Anyway.
It's low profile for a while, all right?
All right.
You take a picture on that,
you don't have to take it to photomart...
-to get it turned around?
-No, it goes on a computer.
I got to take a leak.
I go next, all right?
Pretty boy. Hey, there.
Christ, Ziggy.
Jimmy, just a scheduling thing.
Sean was invited to Mark Lohrman's
birthday party on Saturday.
So you can pick him up there after 2:00.
I realize it's your weekend,
but Sean would be upset if he missed it.
Okay? Great.
Omar by the end of the week, Jimmy.
Ilene is on the warpath.
Motherfucker, I am serious.
Mr. McNulty, this is Dr. Halpern's office.
You missed your six-month cleaning
on Tuesday...
and we haven't heard from you.
Give us a call, please.
McNulty, this is your dear friend
llene Nathan.
I indicted this piece-of-shit case...
because you swore to me
we had an eyeball witness....
Drive time is 6:38 in the a.m.
and we have reports of a....
-Go around, asshole.
-What'd you call me?
I'm sleeping on this side.
Because you got to get up, everybody does?
Yup.
Wipe off the seat, Nick, I know you hit it.
-If I could fart now, I would.
-That's a surprise.
No chance for breakfast?
No. I'll stop by the bar.
No, you won't. You ain't got time.
You got to run me past my ma's
to pick up Ashley.
Shit, hurry up, then.
You know I got a ship to work today.
Your ma knows you got a ship, too.
Don't go upstairs. Just head out the back.
I'll pick you up at the back
of the alley, all right?
Jesus, Nicky, we got a kid together.
What's the big deal we spend the night
in your folks' basement?
They're decent people.
-We ain't got time.
-I know.
-So, why you grabbing?
-They were staring right at me.
I'll meet you out back.
So how do you get the container
off the ship, off the dock?
I guess if you wanted
to make sure your cargo...
isn't messed with, you'd want to get
with one of the checkers.
-Who are they?
-Local 1514.
They monitor
all the loading and offloading...
they match the manifests,
they tally the cargo.
Nothing goes in or out
without them putting it down somewhere.
-Or not.
-Or not.
So we need to talk to a checker.
What?
Black, white, Polish, lrish, ltalian,
it doesn't matter.
No one talks to police.
How do you make a case then?
I patrol.
I write traffic tickets.
If we got an open container,
or a damaged container...
I take a report.
We got something stolen,
I take another report.
Someone gets something dropped on him
or gets run over by a front-end loader...
-I keep writing.
-That's the job?
How long you been on?
-Two years.
-What did you do before that?
I took tolls from people
at the Fort McHenry tunnel.
Which, I'm happy to say,
wasn't nearly as much fun.
Made $22,500
and went home tired every night...
until I walked by the office bulletin board
one night...
read the MDOT job posting.
Port Authority officers, Schedule one,
starting at $33,000 with benefits.
Toll-taking days were over?
Father of my two kids
went to Houston in '99...
hasn't so much as called in three years.
I wasn't gonna make it on $22,500.
Not with kids, I wasn't.
Did you want to be a police?
-Could've been me the other night.
-True.
Except for all of a sudden,
you up and tell me to stop doing that.
Avon to the rescue. How did you know?
I figured you were gonna be
bringing your ass in here...
to thank me for pulling you off of that shit.
Five dead. More in the infirmary.
-How did you know?
-I did as your uncle should...
because I'm concerned about
you fucking yourself up.
You knew.
Look, man, I ain't had nothing to do with it.
I might know who did, though.
You practically running this place.
Who else could it be?
It ain't about what happened,
you understand?
It's about using what happened
to our advantage.
Play or you gonna get played.
I need to know that you ain't do that shit.
That's what I need to know.
I already said it.
You ain't gonna believe it, fuck it.
You can tell yourself that I spiked it,
but be grateful that you still standing.
Once you done with all that...
we can talk about how we start
shaving some of these years off.
And not just for me, for you, too.
They looking for the motherfucker
who brought that shit in here.
They need him to fall. And you know what?
I can give you a name.
I can give you the right name.
We can take that name
down to the assistant warden...
and we can get some of our lives back.
You dig?
So, stay close.
This play on the inside,
this play on the outside...
we got it all covered.
I don't want no part of what you do no more.
You hear me?
So you can just leave me
the fuck out of that.
Whatever it is.
Anyone seen Omar?
We're back in!
Six ships in one day.
Ain't seen the terminal this busy in months.
Feels sweet.
Shit, look at this pretty bitch.
-What the fuck are you wearing?
-Italian leather, all right?
In the middle of winter?
On the goddamn docks?
-How much does that shit cost?
-$2,000.
For a goddamn jacket?
Are you out your fucking mind, Zig?
Fuck it.
$2,000 for a single goddamn jacket.
Jesus, Zig, you need therapy and shit.
I figured an African-American
such as yourself would understand...
how a player such as myself
needs to take heed in the latest fashion.
But apparently,
you ain't got no fucking style neither.
-I'm gonna walk, all right?
-See you.
What?
What did I tell you about
not spreading no cash around?
Jesus Christ, Nicky, it's a fucking coat.
I can tell people I'm paying for it
on installments or whatever.
But you got to admit, I do look pretty today.
I do.
The Greeks wanna talk to us.
What about?
We did good by them.
Yeah?
But, for Christ sakes, Zig,
keep your shit quiet...
before half the fucking waterfront's
talking about us.
All right, no problem.
-All right. See you later.
-See you.
Yo, quit it.
Gentlemen.
We don't need that now.
-Say what?
-I don't give a shit about drugs.
Littering pisses me off, though.
You can pick that up when I'm gone.
I'm looking for a stick-up boy,
name of Omar.
Dark-skinned, thin guy
with a scar right down his face.
You boys would definitely know him
if you saw him...
because he's got a shotgun about yea-long.
He'll put it to your head
and steal your shit without thinking twice.
Does anyone know where he hangs?
Who he's running with?
What he's driving?
Fuck you, Officer.
The second package came
even weaker than the last.
It won't take the cut like it did before.
Fucking Atlanta shit cost more
and still not as good.
Came in at 25.
All we can do is sprinkle it and bag it.
And lose my money?
I lose my money.
Step on that motherfucker.
How hard?
Make it 10.
-It's shit now.
-I know.
So the container itself leads us nowhere.
Fake addresses on either end.
Which leaves us the port itself.
Because whatever went wrong
on that ship was known to whoever...
was supposed to pick that container up.
Which is why it stays on the dock.
Bottom line is, we need to know more
about cargo moving off that terminal.
How to do dirt.
And how to hide when you're doing dirt.
Bottom line for me is different.
Bottom line for me is,
you guys should've held that ship.
For your crime scene, for your witnesses,
for the whole damn case.
Sir, the witnesses--
I don't care if they were
speaking Mandarin Chinese...
with a cocksucker's lisp.
They needed to see the inside of
an interrogation room. They were the case.
We were in Philadelphia,
with no real jurisdiction...
dealing with foreign nationals
and no real probable cause.
I can only tell you
what it looks like from where I sit.
And from here, the view is
two of my detectives fucking the dog.
Thirteen homicides, 14, if we connect
the floater, and all of them red.
So what can I tell you?
If this case doesn't fall,
we're all gonna be stepping on our dicks...
trying to explain what happened.
So, work it as you see fit...
but understand...
if I have to throw Burrell
a scapegoat or two...
I got one to throw.
Fuck me.
What did you want to talk to us about?
If you are able to do like you did,
we have other things we can use.
Like what?
Fact is, we shook things up down there
snatching all them cameras.
It comes to expensive shit like that,
we got to lay back for a while.
Stuff we need is not like that.
No?
Acetone, sulfuric acid,
potassium permanganate.
-Chemicals?
-It's like paint thinner, shit like that.
What do you need with those?
Just go get them at the hardware store.
No. We need much.
Metric tons. Five or ten tons.
Check and you'll see,
they make these things here.
Send them from here.
Tanks and tanks down at your docks.
Good money for those.
How much?
How much chemical? Two tons? Four?
-Eight?
-I'll look into it.
Yo, Bubbles!
McNulty.
My meanest man.
Get in the car.
Where you been at, brother?
What did you get? Walkman.
You know how it works, Bubs.
You're going to pay taxes on this shit.
Taxation without representation, you know?
I don't want much. I need Omar.
Wild Omar?
You want us to wander around town...
Iooking for a crazy motherfucker
with a shotgun?
Him and me go way back,
it's a friendly thing.
If he's a friend,
you can find the motherfucker without us.
No problem. Show me the receipt
for this shit, you're off the hook.
-Here.
-Keep it, part of my tax.
Your tax is Omar.
I need a line by Friday, Bubs.
Fuck!
My client will provide accurate information
as to the source of the tainted narcotics.
My client will provide accurate information
as to the source of the tainted narcotics.
He can identify the method
by which contraband is smuggled...
into this institution,
as well as the people responsible.
Cellblock talk is cheap.
He'll give you what you need
to make a case...
-if that's what you're interested in.
-Your terms?
Mr. Barksdale is due
for a first parole hearing at 28 months.
We'd like to trim that to a year...
and have your assurances
of institutional support...
for work release and early parole.
One year on a seven-year bit?
We are offering extraordinary cooperation
in this matter.
Mr. Barksdale's placing himself at risk...
by offering information
implicating other prisoners...
and staff at MCl.
And I would only add that
Mr. Barksdale's extant conviction is his first.
He has no priors whatsoever.
It's my recollection that a city police
got shot behind Mr. Barksdale's business.
-No, sir.
-You don't remember that?
I remember the officer got shot.
And I remember being upset about that,
not only because the officer got shot...
but because I knew it meant
there was gonna be more police on me.
I remember thinking, "Any time any fool
do something like shoot a police...
"it's bad on everyone."
I know that you know
that my name ain't nowhere...
on what happened to your friend.
I think what we're asking is reasonable
under the circumstances.
After all, until someone identifies the source
of the tainted heroin...
you could have
another five overdoses tomorrow.
Or the day after.
Consider the offer.
But the next time we talk...
an assistant attorney general
has to be in the room.
Tuna surprise?
Christ sakes, Ma,
I climbed all over two ships today.
How about a meal for that kind of day?
-Where's Pop?
-He's at the bar with the horses.
Go tell him it's dinner.
-We winning, Pop?
-Nicko.
You up today?
I was doing good,
but this year Gulfstream is killing me.
Go easy. That's my inheritance.
After 25 years, I'm still ahead almost $7,000.
You ought to let me take you up to Pimlico
when it opens.
Try your system out for real.
Too tempting.
Just once.
Saw that the Cape Spruance
is over at Point West.
Yeah, we offloaded her today.
You know we double-hulled her
down at number four.
Maybe two years before
the dry dock closed up.
She still floats?
Of course she still floats.
You ever miss it, Pop?
You ever miss it, Pop?
Wouldn't do no good.
What's for dinner?
Tuna surprise.
You're loyal to your people.
I respect that, at least.
Don't worry, Lieutenant.
Burrell wants you on this detail,
so I want you, too.
I need your approval
for Freamon, Greggs, and Hauk.
-They're all CID.
-Correction.
You need my approval for everyone.
This may be Valchek's creation...
but the detail is investigative
and comes under CID.
If they work for me, they need my okay.
Good news is, I got no problem
with anyone on your list.
Except McNulty. No McNulty.
Nothing that even resembles
the son of a bitch.
-That bad?
-He quits or he drowns.
That's the only two things get him
off the fucking boat, so help me God.
You even know what
this detail's about, Lieutenant?
Some kind of beef that Valchek has.
Two fucking Polacks
pissing on each other's leg.
I heard.
Anything to get you
out of the basement, Lieutenant?
Girl.
No! Kima, who cares?
We're gonna be there in five minutes
and they'll still be dumbass frat boys.
You got to start thinking,
what would a lawyer do?
What would a lawyer say?
Shakima Greggs, Esquire.
That's what I'm talking about.
-Get your ass down, fool.
-Fuck you, lady.
Ain't no lady.
-Bitch, drive it or lose it.
-Oh, my God, let's get out of here.
Only the finest breeds can perform this well,
with this much heart and obedience.
Obedience that brings out the champion
not only in show dogs....
Look at that tiger go. A third generation
champion from Glassport.
Even house pets that never knew
they had the blood of champions in them.
To perform at this level...
an animal has to follow orders
without question.
It is not instinct.
Come on upstairs.
All dogs have instinct.
Jesus Christ.
Nothing's on this side. Most chemicals
are over at the Fairfield terminals.
Who do we know at Fairfield?
Ott's brother-in-law works there.
You might try and touch him.
What do they want with those for, anyway?
Beats the fuck out of me.
-Jesus, I'm sorry.
-Fuck, man, shit.
I didn't see you standing there
in all that sweet leather.
-What the fuck is wrong with you?
-Clumsy, I guess.
You can just go out
and steal a whole can full of baby wipes...
and just clean yourself up.
You fucking goof.
Dick.
Shit, Lieutenant, I promised.
Think my woman's gonna give
a great big cheer when she hears about it?
-I was out the damn door.
-You don't know Cheryl.
You don't know Marla.
If you want...
I could use you inside,
like we did Prez last year.
If I hear the music, I'm gonna dance.
I'll tell your wife, if you tell mine.
In the car, but not out in the open.
Yo, Rock.
Be subtle with it, man.
-You know what subtle means?
-Laid back and shit.
-Good tunes, Pop?
-Yeah.
Thanks for the phones.
I don't know, Bubs. I mean...
if you go rolling over rocks...
then you're gonna get bit by a snake, right?
Got to pay that tax, Johnny.
You got to give a working police his due.
-So, Bee's working for Lamar?
-All of them work for Lamar.
He got that whole corner to hisself.
You saying the stash is across the street
in the low-rises?
In the second court.
They got it up in this one place
that got the boarded-up windows.
How many doors down from the end?
Three.
Yo, Pops.
Anyone got a line on that wild boy
who likes to pop the shotty?
-Omar?
-Yeah, I need Omar.
What do you want with Omar?
Just want a word with him.
Just a word.
You want to get with Omar...
you need to stand out
on one of them corners...
with a big-ass package.
You be talking to that nigger soon enough.
You feel anything?
Let's go.
Come on.
As agreed, the price of cooperation is
an agreement by the state parole officials...
to move Mr. Barksdale's
first parole hearing forward by 12 months...
and to credit him in the file
with cooperation in this matter.
You can't make a case
on just some con's say so.
We need the dope on the table.
Of course you do.
If, before the end of business today,
you effect a search...
of Correctional Officer Tilghman's vehicle,
locker, and person...
we are confident
sufficient evidence will be recovered.
"We are confident"?
As far as D.O.C. is concerned,
this is a fair deal...
if it takes the overdoses off our plate.
But if we come up empty on this....
You won't.
Five will get you ten...
that's the motherfucker
that spiked the packages.
You have proof of this?
Then we make the case
that's there for us to make.
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. New Orleans.
Lieutenant.
-Welcome to the southeast.
-Major, I understand you asked for me.
My son-in-law can't say enough
in your favor.
And, of course, you did him
a good turn last year, right?
-You want to tell me about this target?
-Frank Sobotka.
A union man down at the port.
The motherfucker's showing a lot of money.
My gut says a drug connection.
I can also tell you for a fact
that his people...
will up and steal anything
that isn't nailed down.
-You seen the off-site?
-Not yet.
I told my people to meet up here,
at the district.
Pretty good digs. Come on, I'll show you.
It's from a young woman to her mother...
or at least an older woman.
She mention any names?
There is an Anya here.
And from the way she writes,
I'm guessing it is a child.
It's almost ready, Father. Excuse me.
-So who's she writing to?
-There is no name.
The letter is for the whole family.
But...
she signs, "Nadya." Her name is Nadya.
-Nadya.
-Is she in trouble?
She's dead.
Anything in the letter to indicate
as to where these people live?
If you had an envelope, I could....
The only thing specific she mentions,
is a church...
St. Volodymyr, or St. Vladimir, and a priest.
St. Volodymyr, or St. Vladimir, and a priest.
-Father Vasyl, it says.
-There's no names or places or....
Across the water,
Father Vasyl is a common name...
and there are many St. Volodymyrs.
But leave the letter. I will try.
Thank you.
I'm saying, if there isn't enough work,
then you could do something else, that's all.
There's enough work.
Fact is, I came into
some back pay I was owed...
from about a month ago.
A couple thousand from
the vacation fund.
Stop, Ash.
I was thinking...
maybe this'll be the time
for us to get a place.
You could cover that?
And maybe we don't rent.
Maybe we try and buy something
in the neighborhood.
Nothing too big, just....
I heard Aunt Treesey's
old place up in Covington...
has been fixed up real nice.
Like with wood floors and all.
Ash, what's that ship right there?
-Cable ship.
-And what's the gray one next to it?
Military Sealift.
Attagirl.
You cold?
-Dwight?
-What's up?
We're gonna have to
search your vehicle. Sorry.
Search? What the fuck?
Open it, or I'm gonna shim the lock,
maybe damage your ride.
You got no call to be doing me like this.
-No call and no damn warrant.
-You drive onto a D.O.C. facility...
you acknowledge the vehicle's
subject to search.
Where's the key, Dwight?
He's gonna be back
from lunch any minute, Zig.
You hear me? He sees you on that thing...
he's gonna break you down
and sell you for parts.
Here it be.
You all planted that shit.
You fucking know you did.
-What's with the whistle squad?
-It's for us.
They marked us the moment
we stepped out of the car.
-That's him.
-That's Horseface?
-How did he get the name?
-You need a close-up?
Thomas Pakusa.
We need to talk to you about something.
What?
You were working the Atlantic Light
when it docked, right?
If you say so.
You remember that container
that came off that day?
-With all the dead girls.
-No.
You don't remember
all them dead girls in a can?
Come on, Horse.
I remember when you found them all
in the stacks.
I don't remember
they came off the Atlantic Light.
Let's take a ride downtown,
clear this mess up.
No.
Get the fuck in the car.
-Am I locked up?
-Get in the damn car.
You want me in that car,
you need to lock me up.
If that's the way it'll be,
I wanna talk to my shop steward...
and he can have an IBS lawyer go with me.
Dad, what--
Jesus, Pop, what's that for?
Say cheese.
You pull another stunt like that, Zig,
I'll have your damn card.
I don't care who your mother is.
Get the fuck out of here!
Kind of smart for a fat man, isn't he?
All right.
Goddamn it, Ziggy, you sick fuck.
Get your dick out of my computer!
Where are the detectives
who were first assigned?
Dead. To me, anyway.
I shipped them humps back to Burrell
as fast as I could.
What kept you?
That's the beautiful thing
about this department.
Every brain-dead
somehow manages to land on his feet.
-How's it hanging, Prez?
-How're you doing?
I'm all right.
Where's Lester? We got him, too, right?
He was out on the street
today with Homicide...
but Rawls promised to give him
the bad news tomorrow.
Not McNulty though.
McNulty they really hate,
not that I blame them.
You, of course,
have Roland for the duration.
Anyone else from the southeastern
you need, you got.
I'll leave you to it, then.
Carver's in the southeast, now.
I think he's got Sector Two.
It'd be great to have Carver on this, right?
On what?
We don't even know what the hell
we're supposed to be chasing here.
No offense to your father-in-law,
but it's real thin.
We're here, right? Whatever happens,
we run with the program for a few weeks.
Maybe make a drug case or two
down by the port.
Beats the hell out of E.C.U. anyway.
Him and this lady have this daughter.
The daughter's born a mute.
The wife doesn't like that at all,
so she breaks out.
So this guy's raising his daughter,
she has her period...
freaks out, goes to him,
he thinks she was raped--
Jackpot.
That's about $10 worth
of bulk metal right there.
We just have to haul it down
to the scrap yard and we're good.
We'll break our fucking backs on this thing.
Keep your eye to the ground, okay?
I'm schooling you.
Okay?
This is good, right here.
This is $10 right here.
Snitching Bubs.
You be asking for me?
These headphones are great.
I'm gonna use them at the gym. Thanks.
-You hear the boys?
-No, it's quiet up there.
A little too quiet.
That means they're probably
playing video games.
Or with a book of matches.
So, did you have a lawyer
look at the papers yet?
I did.
-And?
-He says I shouldn't sign it.
Says I'm giving away too much.
I would never, under any circumstances...
pay that kind of support and alimony
if we went to court.
That's what he says?
Signed and notarized.
I don't wanna argue about the money.
I wanna get back together.
Yeah.
Yo, String, I was subtle with that.
...has led to drug distribution charges
against three inmates...
one who was, himself, incapacitated...
by the tainted narcotics
and the correctional officer...
a 10-year veteran.
I've been instructed
by the Corrections Commissioner...
and the State Public Safety Secretary...
to announce that the maximum penalties...
will be sought against this officer....
I got a midterm. I got to study.
-So this is their joint?
-What's the plan?
Time to make it clear to these people
that we're not gonna go away.
You ain't gonna play
that country shit, right?
I hate that country shit.
Not even Ray Charles
can save that mess for me.
No, sir.
Big Daddy Lipscomb was right tackle.
Your brain's gone to shit, Jessy.
Left tackle.
You was too busy pissing in your drawers
to learn left from right.
Take your ass down to Schula's Steakhouse
and get an education.
Darling.
What's the deal?
Just dropping in for one or two
and then we take ourselves out of here.
How about you?
I'm leaving after this one.
You guys Port Police?
I don't recognize either one of you.
-City Homicide.
-Homicide?
-Who got killed?
-Those dead girls in the can.
That was an accident.
That was a fucking accident.
That's what I heard, anyway.
Excuse me.
My man.
Ain't but $290 here.
Goddamn it, Frog,
when you work a g-pack for a guy...
a kickback's supposed to be $500.
Stash got hit, yo.
I ain't hearing that shit!
I want my fucking money!
You'd best know
I ain't playing, motherfucker.
Okay, that's how you want it? Fine!
But when I roll back past here tomorrow,
money gonna be right, or you gonna see.
You gonna see who you're fucking with!
Do I look like a fucking punk?
Yo, shorty.
Get me a Snapple
and a bag of crab chips from the corner.
What the fuck is your problem, asshole?
Fuck, this is bad shit!
Fuck, this is really bad.
Shit.
Get your ass out that car.
All right!
Shut up.
Where the money at? Check his socks.
You got something for me here, Zig?
You got some dough for me, man?
Jesus, jackpot.
Man, hold up, man.
Ain't enough here to really
call this shit money, man.
Cheese, take it easy, I'm working on it.
But my people, you know....
What the fuck you think this is, man?
What, you think this supposed
to get played some other way?
Is that what you think, man?
Damn it, son of a bitch, that hurt.
Yeah, I know it did.
All right, look, how about the coat?
Take the coat, all right?
I paid two large for it...
so that, plus the cash I gave you...
and then I can get $700 more
by the end of the week.
You know I will!
You know right there, you can fix that.
$2,000?
For this?
Not even a black man could style that shit.
You know what I'm saying, man?
What you laughing at, man?
Chill, be cool about it.
I'll get your money by Friday.
Then you'll see there's no need
to get all fucking dramatic out here!
Look, man, if I ain't paid by Friday,
you dead by Saturday, man.
Yo, take my man's ride.
Fuck, I need that! I fucking need that!
Fuck you!
Why me?
You don't want the posting,
I'll take someone else.
Valchek gave me the pick of his district.
I'm not saying I don't want it.
I'm asking why you would choose me
after what happened last go around.
Yeah, I thought about that, too.
Looking at the list of names
on the southeastern roster...
I'm saying to myself:
"Why take a man
who already burned you once...
"who already proved himself disloyal?"
Now, why would I do that?
I have no fucking clue, Lieutenant.
Because if I caught him once...
he might be the last
son of a bitch to try it twice.
I'm guessing you got enough
shame from the last time...
so that it won't happen again.
No, sir, it won't.
One other thing...
as far as I'm concerned,
those stripes on your sleeve aren't earned.
Your paycheck may say "sergeant,"
but on this detail...
Det. Greggs runs your team.
Same as it ever was.
Well?
I'm in.
Come here, you sweet bitch.
Motherfu--
Don't be grabbing my dick, faggot.
I raised him on the radio.
He's on his way in right now.
Appreciate that, Officer. Nice day.
Summit Silver 450.
Top of the line, right here.
Over there?
Yo, Bubs.
McNulty, the sailor man? Watch the front.
Here. Stick that on that thing there,
will you?
The cleat? Ain't you know nothing?
Look at you, I don't know,
maybe it's just me...
but something's way the fuck
wrong with this picture.
What the hell is that?
A Baltimore knot.
What the hell is a Baltimore knot?
I don't know, but it's never
the same thing twice.
What can I tell you?
My detecting days are over.
What the fuck you have me
hunt up Omar then for?
That's old business. You remember Bird?
His trial's up next week.
Omar's got some witnessing to do.
He said you can reach him
here at this number.
You can leave a message.
Good work, Bubs.
As always. Here.
Cab fare.
You say tit-for-tat,
and we let slide on a little county caper.
I got to think that, you know,
you need to think about...
what you had me
endeavoring to accomplish.
I mean, what the fuck, man?
I'm not out there asking about
no random-ass, who-give-a-damn nigger.
No, sir. I'm making inquiries in your behalf...
in regards to that fucking unforgiving,
motherfucking Omar, man.
Why? He play you hard?
I go at him respectable...
he put that goddamn
shotgun in my face, man.
I'm looking at two tubes
of the harbor tunnel...
staring right at me, each one about yea-big.
I damn near pissed in my pants...
and he stood smiling like this shit is funny.
It ain't funny.
McNulty, I know I'm paying
taxes on some things...
I got to believe this
is more aggregation than:
"Good work, bubs," and a little bit of this.
For your pains.
Where are we at with the Jane Does?
Taking a hard look at the port,
we're gonna drop a grand jury summons...
on every stevedore who worked the ship,
keep rattling cages.
How's the port police broad
working out for us?
She knows the docks okay.
No detective, though.
In that case, you need someone fresh.
Cole, maybe, Massy or whoever's up.
You need to get over
to the southeastern today.
You're detailed temporarily.
Colonel, respectfully,
did you just fuck me over...
without giving me even half
a chance to clear this case?
Let's be clear, Det. Freamon.
When I fuck you over, you'll know it.
You'll be so goddamn certain,
you won't need to ask the question.
And you, Det. Moreland,
are now all alone with 14 red names.
How's it feel?
And the parking pad in the rear
is invaluable for Federal Hill.
The deck has a harbor view?
Yes, in two directions.
Go on up, take a look. I think you'll love it.
-This ain't Federal Hill.
-Excuse me?
This is the Point, Locust Point.
As far as real estate goes,
anything that is below Montgomery Street...
and above the water
is now called Federal Hill.
Are you two house hunting?
We just started.
If you're interested in this area,
I could run some listings for you.
-This particular house--
-Is my aunt Treesey's.
Really, your aunt?
ls she a relation to the McDonalds?
Nope. She's a relation to me.
She died, like, four years ago.
The family sold the house right after.
Is that the price?
That's the listing, yes.
They ain't gonna get that much, right?
I can't say for certain, but one just like it...
in the 1 200 block
sold for $340,000 last week.
$340,000?
-Thanks.
-Yeah.
Maybe we should rent.
We're here because Valchek wants us here...
because he believes this man
and his down-at-the-heels union local...
has too much money.
To start with, you and Freamon
are gonna put some DNRs...
on the union hall phones.
Also, run what you can on the
union finances and on Sobotka personally.
We put that together, copy it to the major
to show him we're on it...
and buy ourselves a little time.
Meanwhile, you three, do what you do best.
Find out where port folks like to cop
on a Friday night...
set up some hand-to-hands,
maybe a reverse or two.
A lot of these port guys are white,
aren't they?
I mean, some of the southeast
street dealers, too.
So that means
you're gonna need a white boy...
to go down to some of these
southeastern corners, right?
So Kima, Carv on the rooftops.
It's my time to front.
I'll show you how it's done, homes.
Cool Lester smooth.
What's happening?
Same fuck-ups in the same shit detail...
working out of the same
shithouse kind of office.
You people lack for personal growth,
you know that?
It's a temporary posting.
Rawls gets you back at the end of the run.
If he wants me.
Last I looked, I was high on his shit list.
-Then we did you a favor.
-I wouldn't go that far.
But fuck it. Who we chasing?
Frank Sobotka?
-How fucking good is he?
-You know the man?
Me and Bunk Moreland
were fucking with this guy last week...
working that case about
dead girls in the container.
He a suspect?
No, just someone who know what's
getting done on the port terminals.
-Why are you on him?
-My father-in-law hates his guts.
Which, in the southeastern,
goes for probable cause.
Valchek thinks he has too much cash.
So you're thinking drugs?
In this fucking town,
what other crime is there?
You know I would've been
down here sooner, it's just...
with Terrell being sick and all....
But, Dee, I got everything we need paid for.
When you come home, Stringer's
saying they gonna hook you up...
with something out of the mix.
Like running a club,
or straight business, like.
String say they gonna
keep you apart from it...
and give back some time for family.
For you and me and Terrell.
Family?
They thinking about
how they can do for you.
They making all these plans...
even though you been
playing cold with your uncle.
Stringer says so, anyhow.
Why you be like that?
Throwing them off
when they looking to do for you?
They playing you with that
"We're family, and it's all about love."
That's how they do.
When they got no more use for you,
that family shit disappears.
It's just about business, Donette.
Dee, they gonna be there for us.
What's up, man? You got that Death Grip.
-You know Stony got that check.
-Slow down, fool.
I'm saying you need to spend that shit here.
-Death Grip be the fucking bomb, yo.
-I ain't got no ends.
Motherfucker said it ain't shit.
No, I ain't say that.
That's enough, yo, let that shit be.
-Fuck you all.
-Yeah, motherfucker?
Yo, B.
Shit jumping off in the Pit, yo.
Damn.
What the fuck was that?
Fiend badmouthing our shit,
saying Death Grip ain't all that.
Now we're beating niggers
over speaking the truth?
I ain't hit him, the young'uns, yo.
You can't tell these fools nothing.
We stomping niggers over bullshit, man.
Somebody got to pull Stringer up on this.
Zig, what's up?
Jesus, Zig, what the fuck happened?
Fucking niggers got me.
What?
Took my money, and they got Princess, too.
You hear me? They got my fucking car.
If I had a gun, I swear to God...
I would've capped every one
of those motherfuckers.
-You call the cops?
-Can't.
It was over some dope.
You bought a fucking package, didn't you?
Serves you right, you stupid fuck.
From who? White Mike?
This nigger Cheese,
up on Wolfe and Ashland.
-A few ounces, you know?
-Why not White Mike?
Fuck Mike, you know how he be.
Why the fuck would I know how he be?
Nicky, it ain't my fault, all right? It ain't.
Look, business has been slow,
package ain't turned around yet.
But the fucking hoodleheads ain't hearing it,
so I get jumped.
They got Princess, man.
They're holding her for fucking ransom.
And now they're telling me...
if I don't have the money by Friday,
they're going to kill me.
I need $2,700.
So?
You're a drug dealer,
go sell some fucking drugs.
You fucked up the package, didn't you, Zig?
I ain't giving you the money.
They're gonna kill me.
I gave my money to Aimee for an apartment.
Security deposit and some
furniture over at Littlepages.
I ain't got it for you, Zig.
You cocksuckers.
-Major in?
-Yeah, just knock.
Yeah?
We're about to make some
hand-to-hands around the port.
Lt. Daniels said I should see you about
a surveillance van.
The van?
The van's on loan to the southwest.
Okay.
Fuck with my ass, will you?
Bringing us back to our old friends,
supply and demand.
All right, your research papers are here.
Remember Friday, take-home test.
Well done, Mr. Bell.
-Mr. Lucas, you got five minutes?
-Absolutely.
There's something
maybe you can help me out with.
I'll try.
What are the options
when you got an inferior product...
in an aggressive marketplace?
If you have a large share of the market,
you can buy up the competition.
And if you don't?
Reduce price to increase market share.
That assumes low overhead.
Of course, otherwise,
you operate at a loss...
and worse, as your prices drop...
your product eventually
loses consumer credibility.
You know, the new CEO of WorldCom
was faced with this very problem.
The company was linked
to one of the largest fraud cases in history.
-So he proposed--
-To change the name?
Exactly.
Which one?
He's got a weenie in his hand.
On this case, ain't that you?
Thomas Pakusa, come on down.
What the fuck is that?
Grand jury summons.
Grand jury?
You lie to us, you hurt our feelings.
You lie to them, it's perjury.
And one more I just dropped
on your barbecue chef outside.
You used to be a lot more fun,
you know that, Bea?
That's John Spamanato right there.
Johnny Fifty. How you doing, Officer?
Johnny Fifty?
What the fuck is that?
Son of a bitch drinks 53 beers
on his 25th birthday.
So as to be, what do you call it,
poetical, we rounded it off.
"Grand jury for the circuit
court of Baltimore City."
You worked the Atlantic Light, right?
Everybody on that ship testifies.
About what?
About them girls in the can.
The detective here thinks
we know something about that mess.
He thinks we'd leave them there
on the dock...
in a box, dying there in the dark because....
Because why, Detective?
What reason would we have
to want girls to die like that?
Why would any of us leave them in there
if we knew anything about it?
I got a wife and three sisters.
And they got daughters.
And I got too much respect for women
not to be pissed off...
at what's in your heads right now.
Of all the cans on the terminal,
that's the one you lose in the stacks.
We didn't know shit, goddamn it!
You want us to dance
with a grand jury, we will!
What do you say, Johnny?
What do you say to any question?
I take the fifth commandment.
And if they offer you immunity
to testify against your union brothers?
-I don't remember.
-Don't remember what?
Nothing.
What you're forgetting
is that every I.B.S. Iocal on the East Coast...
has had its ass in front of a federal
grand jury two or three times already.
You want to throw your summonses?
Throw them.
You want to subpoena our records?
You don't need a subpoena no more.
Our books were open
to the Justice Department for eight years.
We're here through
Bobby Kennedy, Tricky Dick Nixon...
Ronnie "The Union Buster" Reagan,
and half a dozen other sons of bitches.
We'll be here
through your weak bullshit, no problem!
These four ain't working today.
You wanna leave the papers here...
I'll make sure they get them
and go downtown on them.
Come on.
-Today?
-Now!
You described the weapon
used to kill Mr. Gant...
as a .380 semi-automatic.
You provided the size,
and even suggested the manufacturer:
"Australian, or one of those 'A' countries."
Is that correct?
Indeed.
And you were approximately
50 feet from the shooter?
Yes, ma'am, you know, give or take.
Mr. Little, at that distance
how were you able to determine...
who manufactured the weapon?
I wasn't.
Then how were you able
to relate that information...
to the detectives?
Bird showed it to me.
He showed you the weapon
before the murder?
Which murder we talking?
Bird committed more than one murder?
Fish got to swim,
you know what I'm saying?
Like I said before, Bird was
showing that thing to everybody...
talking about this deed and the next.
I didn't pay him no mind until you all came
and showed him some interest.
Mr. Little,
if you wouldn't mind waiting outside...
I'd like a few words with Officer McNulty.
I thought he did good.
Imagine the mileage
Maury Levy gets out of me...
putting that sociopath on the stand.
You got to admit, it'll be different.
Dress him up at least.
I can't have him on the stand
looking like that.
Here's a voucher for court clothes.
Anything with a tie.
I'm saying, Dirt...
you wanna be my nigger,
you got to be with me for real.
You see what I'm saying, yo?
Well, I'll be.
All the time I be telling you, be on post.
But damn, homes,
you all the time up in some damn crib...
trying to play house with them bitches.
I'm saying, you all be seriously
fucked up because I'm out here...
getting done what needs done.
Feel me, nigga?
Thieving motherfuckers
take everything, don't they?
You know what I'm saying, Dirt.
You wanna be my nigger,
you gots to deliver for real.
How'd we do, Charlie?
I've almost got one of them ready to swear
that the docks are actually near the water.
They don't scare, them guys.
What now?
You telling me you never had
a CI down there, right?
A Cl?
An informant.
You ain't got no informants on the dock?
Someone you could go to on this?
Someone you got a history with?
They say a police is only
as good as his informants.
Meaning, we ain't about much.
The voucher says $150.
Look on the clearance rack.
-It's a look.
-No, it ain't.
You figure it out for yourself. I'm going
across the street to the federal building.
I'll see you in about a half-hour.
Look, man, if I ain't here, I'm round
the way on Howard Street, Liddell's.
Either that, or I'll be with Muffy at the club.
Where's he at?
Said he had to go get his props.
1 2-08.
12-08.
Request lateral with 1 2-10.
KGA, he can meet me on 6.
Do you copy, 12-08?
10-4, on 6.
Yo, dickhead, where you been at?
When you're working deep cover, Carv,
you got to get into the part.
What's up? You need a little help?
Maybe, bro. You got any raw up in here?
-You got it to spend?
-For sure.
All right, then we good.
Go and holler at my niggers round back.
Yo, Carv. You copy this?
It's all in the props, baby.
All in the props.
Feel any different? Me neither.
-Special Agent Cleary.
-Jim McNulty, from the city.
How can I help you?
Found floating off the Key Bridge.
We think she's linked to the dead girls
found in the container at Patapsco.
Your people were just here,
asking for a trace on the can.
-Homicide fellows.
-Black guys, Moreland, Freamon?
-Yeah, you working with them?
-Sort of, I fished her out.
I kind of feel like it's on me
to find her people.
You're kidding, right?
No, I thought maybe
if you guys have, you know...
been pulling in any women who've
been over here on the circuit.
Step into my world, Virginia.
A grand jury?
They snatched up some of our guys,
drove them downtown.
But you know nothing.
Yeah, no shit, we know nothing.
The only guy they got that even knows
you had a can that day was Horse...
and he ain't gonna say shit to nobody.
You sure?
Horse is a rock.
Don't ever worry about him.
My uncle neither.
But you say he wants to stop.
Yeah, for a little while.
He wants you to stop moving
cans through our docks...
at least until this shit chills.
These were local police, right?
Yeah.
Their interest is in the girls.
That happened on the ship,
the ship is gone.
A dead end.
The malaka they want,
we already got to in Philly.
Another dead end.
The police are going nowhere.
But, more important,
we address Frank's concerns.
You tell your uncle I will meet with him.
He says he wants to meet with the Greek.
Anything he can say to the Greek,
he can say to me.
Says he wants the Greek.
Says you tell him when and where.
Niko.
About that other business, the chemicals....
What do you need them for?
It's just business.
Everything is just business with us.
Buy for a nickel, you sell for a dime.
Yeah?
Who wants a dime's worth
of fucking chemicals?
So these are undocumenteds
from just this field office?
Maryland and Delaware only.
Any of them still in your custody?
I'd love the chance to show
some photos, maybe get lucky.
Everyone in that book was deported.
You can guess,
some of them are already back.
Any field office have anything active?
That's what I'm looking at right here.
You got some girls in custody
in San Diego, also Seattle.
Anything I can drive to?
Closest is a case up in Jersey,
Hudson County.
Raid on a couple clubs up there
put 1 2 in their bullpen four days ago.
That'll work.
So you really gonna go up there
on your own time?
I'll take a day, yeah.
What's between you and this girl?
You seen what happens down
at the morgue, when they can't ID a body?
I have.
Mau. How you been?
-Same old.
-Yeah?
You getting some days?
Pretty much.
I'm in the tower now, working the lanes.
You want to come in?
I got, I don't know, some beers,
maybe some Bacardi around.
Maybe we could just go
for a cup of coffee and talk, you know?
Let me get my jacket.
So I tell him,
"Dee, why you acting like that?"
He just sit there
like I didn't say a damn thing.
He off the damn hook.
You tell him about the plans, right?
I told him you all was gonna
set him up and everything.
And he know how you all been
doing for me while he away.
He knows some.
I mean, damn, he don't need
to know about it all, right?
Anyway, I'm saying I'll
get down there next weekend...
and he look at me like I ain't saying shit.
He say just leave him alone.
Got to turn that roast.
You gonna see, String, for real.
Little Donette know how to burn.
Your father bucking us, little man.
What you think about that?
Yeah. I think you're right.
What you looking at?
Fucking Ziggy, man.
I'm about to get my ass
shot behind his bullshit?
We're reasonable, they're reasonable.
Fuck that, maybe on your side of town.
What's up?
Came to see a man about a car.
Maybe tell Cheese we're here.
Yo, Cheese. White boy.
Yo, you got my money, man?
That's what we came to talk about.
Yo, you got to a lot of heart...
coming up in here
without my fucking money.
We thought maybe
we can work something out...
so you can get what's yours.
How you plan to do that?
You give the car back,
I'll get him to sell it off.
Camaro with a 350 in it,
it's got to be worth more than $3,000.
That's right clever. Right clever, I got to say.
And I appreciate you all
coming all this way so much...
I'll give the boy another week to pay.
Of course, that ride ain't
worth nothing near $3,000.
You don't believe me?
Have a look.
You show up at my door,
I'm thinking better thoughts than this.
And you counted on that?
Who else am I gonna ask?
I ain't no snitch, Beadie.
Not even for you am I a snitch.
I'm not thinking about it like that.
I'm thinking, here's a guy,
and we had some times together...
and even though, you know, it didn't
get to where he might have wanted it...
he's still a good guy...
someone I can talk to about this.
How come it didn't go nowhere?
You did good. Who knows?
I don't know, you never know.
I could show you pictures of how they died.
Broken fingernails, blood on the walls.
All of a sudden, you're a cop.
Help me with this, Mau.
You didn't get shit from grabbing up
Horseface and them, did you?
It's kind of funny when you think about it.
I mean, you running around
like your head's all chopped off...
Iooking for someone to clue you in...
when a lot of what you're asking about...
is right there for the taking.
How so?
Used to be us checkers did
everything with paper and a pencil, right?
Every move on a ship, we wrote it down.
When that ship sails,
and there ain't no problems...
then that paper gets tossed.
That don't happen today, right?
Nothing gets tossed anymore.
The computer.
Thanks, Mau.
Well?
Good news and bad, Zig.
Those fucking niggers.
Give me the bad.
They're still gonna kill you.
They're gonna wait a week.
What the fuck can be good?
You can cancel your car insurance.
Let me get two red tops.
There we go.
I hope you guys are taking notes.
Shit.
One-and-one.
One more time with that toothpick,
I'm going to stab his eye with it.
Ashamed he should be to be Greek
and call this a diner.
A talk would ease his mind.
Ease my mind first.
This business with the grand jury.
We checked the courthouse.
There is nothing special.
Just the regular panels.
They're trying to scare
the men on the docks.
-And?
-Nobody talks.
But Sobotka, as I said, he's upset.
It is more attention than he expected.
He will need money for his lawyers.
Double his fee.
But I don't need to meet with him.
Let the money talk.
Everything we get from
Atlanta been walked on.
Each one weaker than the other.
And this nigger Roberto
is on the shelf to us right now.
I mean, it's getting hard
to hold onto the Towers...
without our name all over
the product is what I'm saying.
Who got the good shit?
Eastside.
Eastside, who?
This nigger Milton got a small cut,
Prop Joe...
this Jamaican cat who got
the strip off Gay Street.
You talking about Petey, Petey Dixon.
You go over to the expressway
at lunchtime...
you can watch the fiends
traveling from west to east.
Damn!
I mean, I'm cutting shit with shit right now,
trying to cheat, but sooner or later.
I hear you, man, I'm on it.
You working it out with Dee?
Boy got to find his own way.
I'm saying, you know...
I think we should keep
reaching out to this kid.
Give something to him and his girl.
I don't know, show them we got a plan.
Take some real estate, put it in Dee's name.
He has something to come home to.
Do it.
Thing is, String, what happened happened,
you know what I mean?
Push come to shove,
I've been fair to him, ain't l?
You've been fair.
Too fair.
-Where's the Greek?
-He sent me.
Fuck you, and fuck him.
Frank, he sent me to tell you
that we're doubling your fee...
to help with any legal troubles.
He also told me to tell you he regrets...
that you're still having problems
on our behalf.
They're throwing my people
in back of police cars...
and this asshole can't even talk
face to face?
I'm done. I'm out.
I need nothing more to do with you people.
I don't need the trouble or the money.
I got a union to run.
They used to make steel there, no?
Smoke from the stacks.
But inside....
Potassium permanganate.
Spell "permanganate."
F-U-C-K.
You even know what the fuck
you're doing there, Zig?
I'm in the checker's local, right?
You know, while you Local 47 boys...
were having bulk cargo
dropped on your heads...
we was out grabbing the future by the balls.
So you just type that shit in there
and ask it for an answer?
Let me ask you:
Why do we give a fuck what the shit is for?
If they want it, they want it.
I mean, besides,
if I don't get some money soon...
I'm fucking toasted.
I don't know who you've been talking to...
but we don't have
that kind of stealing going on down here.
-It's not like the old days.
-No?
A little here and there,
but for the most part...
the new technology
has changed everything.
Look, see this little box right here?
You fucking mind?
Ring's a little stressed right now...
having misplaced a frozen can
full of Japanese tuna steaks...
supposed to be at the Jessup
wholesale market by yesterday.
Bite me.
-Frank, these officers are--
-I know who they are.
Frank here helped set this system up.
He probably can explain it better than I can,
if he doesn't mind.
No problem, chief.
In a nutshell, what this shows...
is the Aqua Verde at Berth 4.
The plan calls for 85 moves.
That's cans, containers, coming off the ship,
and others going back on.
Now, look at the screen.
Every time a can goes on or off,
the computer creates a record...
and puts it in the permanent database.
He was saying the computer makes it
hard to steal off the docks.
Did our port manager tell you
that right now...
we got 160 boxes missing
off the Patapsco terminal alone?
Or that last time
we inventoried the truck chassis...
we came up 300 light?
No, I suppose not.
That's management for you.
160?
Not that all of them are stolen.
You can lose a can by accident, no problem.
For one thing,
these hand-helds use radio waves.
With all the equipment
and container stacks out there...
sometimes waves get knocked down.
That happens, a can don't get entered.
Or, just as easy,
a checker makes the wrong entry.
Either 'cause he's lazy, he's sloppy,
or he's still shitfaced from the night before.
Or, simpler than that, you got fat fingers.
No offense.
So imagine February on the docks.
You're wearing Gortex gloves,
trying to punch numbers on that thing.
You're saying
that's what happened to the can...
with the girls in it?
Beadie, darling,
I don't know what happened there.
I'm just saying, if you go by the computer...
it might look like
there's some dirt going down...
when it's really just a glitch in the system.
The customs seal was broke on that box.
Shouldn't that get noticed?
You're offloading a ship
the size of a small town.
You might notice a broke seal,
you might not.
Look, you wanna keep
pulling our chain, you can.
But it ain't like it's just
that one box that went missing.
We lose them sons of bitches all the time.
-Frank give you everything you need?
-He did, thanks.
They're playing us.
You drove all the way from Baltimore
on a hope and a prayer?
Yeah, I'm dead-ended on this.
Is there anything we can offer
any of them for cooperation?
You could marry one of them,
make her an American housewife.
Short of that, they're going back the fuck
where they came from.
-Where do you hold them?
-County detention.
We keep the undocumenteds
out of gen pop.
You all heard of WorldCom?
All right, let's try this.
You all get jacked by some knockos.
But you all clean.
You all got an outstanding warrant,
like everybody in here.
What do you do?
Give another name.
Why?
Because your real name ain't no good.
All right, it ain't good and....
Follow through.
All right, Death Grip ain't shit?
Then change up the name.
What else?
Yo, I got it, change the caps
from red to blue, right?
Make it look like we got
some fresh shit, boom.
You know what else we might could do?
Give each tower its own name, right?
And then we do, like, some fake competing.
So, a fiend gets some bad shit from one,
he'd go back to the other.
There's a thinking man, right there.
See, nigger,
ain't that what the fuck I just said?
You and my uncle talk?
How'd it go?
No problem.
Three boxes.
All of them on the Wilhelmina.
And you should tell your uncle...
that it's three times the usual fee for each.
We checked on those chemicals.
We looked into that.
I was worried, you know?
Before I deliver, I wanna know
what you need it for.
A bomb or some shit?
I ain't down for that.
You use that shit
to process drugs, don't you?
Cocaine.
You still want it,
I got it on the Fairfield piers.
No problem.
When?
End of the week.
Maryska.
She's good with English.
They're dead.
All I'm trying to do is
get word to the families.
What did she say?
She wants to know,
if she knows a girl, does she get to stay?
You want a good restaurant for dinner,
or are you headed right back?
A computer?
To run a trace on the missing containers
in the port administration's database.
You're looking for what?
A pattern for our case. We need to know
who left those girls on the dock and why.
We're supposed to be on Sobotka
and the checkers union anyway...
so folding one investigation
into the other makes sense.
Not to me, it doesn't.
I'm not bringing your open murders...
anywhere near this detail,
that's a loser for us.
Lieutenant!
We bring in a few drug rips,
and show that we gave Sobotka...
and his union a quick, fair look,
it's more than enough for Burrell.
He returns the favor,
and I'm out of the basement...
and running an investigative unit again.
You dirty me up with murders I can't solve.
It doesn't play like that.
Homicide's not the place
to sprawl a case, Lieutenant.
Rawls, Landsman...
they have no patience for anything
but a quick shake.
We got enough room for it here, anyway.
You can set up here at the off-site...
and we can share information.
But the murders stay with Homicide.
Unless, of course, you find a suspect.
Three ROIROs, four containers.
I got all my cards up,
including long numbers...
and we're still short.
-A good day.
-That it is.
Everybody works today,
even you, my little j-series wonders.
Even you.
Is Horse working the Wilhelmina today?
I told that motherfucker we were done.
I told him!
He said he talked to you.
He said it's triple-rate for every can.
Triple?
Call Horse in the tower.
Tell him he's working the Wilhelmina.
It's now or never for us, I got no choice.
Today we got ships, Uncle Frank. Today.
But the writing's on the fucking wall.
Fuck the wall.
Ain't working out for y'all, huh?
-Mars is the god of war, right?
-Planet, too.
I know it's a planet.
But the clue is "Greek god of war."
Ares.
Greeks called him Ares.
Same dude, different name, that's all.
Ares fits. Thanks.
It's all good.
See, back in middle school and all,
I used to love them myths.
That stuff was deep. Truly.
You're up.
State calls Omar Little, Your Honor.
Faggot.
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth...
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?
I surely do.
-State your name for the record.
-Omar Devon Little.
-Mr. Little, how old are you?
-About 29, thereabout.
-And where do you live?
-No place in particular, ma'am.
-You're homeless?
-In the wind, so to speak.
-And what is your occupation?
-Occupation?
What exactly do you do for a living,
Mr. Little?
I rip and run.
-You....
-I robs drug dealers.
And exactly how long has this been
your occupation, Mr. Little?
I don't know exactly.
I venture to say
maybe about eight or nine years.
Mr. Little, how does a man rob drug dealers
for eight or nine years...
and live to tell about it?
Day at a time, I suppose.
What do we know?
On Sobotka, very little.
He seems to live within his means.
House in Glen Burnie,
paid-off truck, modest savings.
-Credit history is okay.
-There's no flash to him, nothing dramatic.
Doesn't sound much
like a money man to me.
-Or maybe he's hiding it.
-The union is also a little threadbare.
They paid the taxes on union hall
almost a year late...
and that was only after
they got hit with liens.
Looking at their books--
-You subpoenaed their books?
-You don't need to.
IBS books are open
to the Justice Department...
under the terms
of a federal racketeering case...
-that came out of New York five years ago.
-We called Washington.
They sent us a copy of everything
the Baltimore locals have filed.
The books show
that there's less than a 100 checkers...
still paying dues to 15-14.
And that's down from about 300 in the '70s.
They're hurting.
So where's all this money
Valchek is talking about?
The IBS hired Bruce DiBiago
to lobby Annapolis this session.
And through individual officers
and union members...
they've paid about $70,000
to various PACs...
and Democratic organizations
in the last eight months.
They show any of that on their books?
No, we pieced that together
from the campaign finance reports.
That's just what was in the names
of the union officers we cross-referenced.
-So, where's the cash coming from?
-Drugs?
So far, DNRs
on the union hall phones don't show much.
Union business and personal calls,
but no beepers...
and not much in the way of cell numbers
or payphones either.
What's with those hand-to-hands?
Anything connect?
We're buying from a lot of white boys.
O'Donnell Heights, Greektown,
Highlandtown above the park.
-But any port connections feel random.
-The money comes from somewhere.
Maybe it's what the checkers do.
I mean...
they monitor what comes in
and out of the port.
-That's what they do, that's their value.
-They're bringing the shit in?
Or they're letting it happen.
Like that can full of dead girls.
They kept that out of the computer.
Which is why we're gonna quietly do
some work on that side of things.
Kima, Prez,
I want you to start looking at girls.
No problem.
If they're coming into Baltimore,
who's working them?
Are they club dancing, whoring?
We need to plug into that circuit.
As for the rest of you...
Lester is gonna stay with the paper trail
and with the DNRs...
Iooking for connections to the union money.
Herc and Carver...
you guys keep working the drug corners
near the port.
Officer Russell here and Bunk Moreland
are assigned to Homicide...
but for the time being they'll be with us...
running the port database, looking
for any pattern involving contraband.
Questions?
Excuse me.
-I'm Thomas.
-Beadie.
Would you like to go to Royal Farms,
maybe get a cup of coffee?
Right.
Yo, I'm Thomas. You want a coffee?
Listen, I was gonna ask her for her panties
to make some soup with...
but I was afraid she'd take it the wrong way.
You were at the opposite end
of the parking lot...
-when the assailant drew his gun?
-Thereabout.
Do you see the gunman who killed Mr. Gant
anywhere in the courtroom today?
Yo, what up, Bird?
For the record, you are identifying
the defendant, Marquis Hilton.
It's just Bird to me.
And Mr. Little, you had seen him
many times before, had you not?
-Yeah, we jailed together down the Cut--
-Objection, Your Honor. May we approach?
Quite a witness, ain't he?
Word on the street is, Omar ain't
nowhere near them rises when the shit pop.
Street said little cocksucker
was over on the East Side...
sticking up some Ashland Avenue niggers.
That's the word on the street, huh?
Trouble is, String, we ain't on the street.
We're in a court of law.
Your Honor--
Objection is noted and preserved
for the record, Mr. Levy. Move on.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Jurors will disregard that last comment
from the witness in which he explained...
where he had last
encountered the defendant.
Yes or no, Mr. Little?
Prior to the shooting,
did you know the defendant?
I knew the man,
but wasn't like he was no friend or nothing.
So you would have no trouble
recognizing him from a moderate distance...
say 20, 25 yards in daylight?
No problem.
Mr. Little, do you recognize...
this particular weapon?
Yeah, that's Bird's gun, the .380.
-You've seen it before?
-Bird always flashing that thing.
So you'd actually seen it
before the day in question.
-And on the day in question?
-It was in Bird's hand.
-When he shot at Mr. Gant?
-Yes, ma'am.
-Bird covet them shiny little pistols.
-Objection, Your Honor.
And the boy too trifling to throw it off
even after a daytime murder.
You're a lying cocksucker, man.
I'll rip your heart out your goddamn chest!
The defendant will regain control
or he will be forcibly restrained...
and I will clear the court.
The witness's last answer is to be stricken
and disregarded by the jury.
Niko.
Eton is my friend.
It's good to have friends meet, no?
Eton, huh?
That's from the Greek, meaning what?
No Greek. Israeli.
Yeah?
'Cause you look Greek, no offense.
Either way, I mean....
-You have the chemicals?
-I can get them, as much as you want.
When?
I was gonna do something this week.
There's been a problem, though.
-What problem?
-My cousin Ziggy.
He got into a beef
with these East Baltimore guys.
Drug dealer by the name of Cheese
took his car, burned it...
now he's saying he's gonna dust Zig
if he doesn't pay.
Yeah, malaka, right.
Zig fucked up the package.
So, you bring us the chemicals, we pay.
Then you pay your debt.
It was $2,700, right?
Now, this asshole is saying it's double.
$5,400, you believe that?
First he takes the car...
and now he's jacking us around
on the money.
-You want, we kill him.
-No.
-That ain't it either, no.
-Why no?
'Cause first of all, Zig fucked it up.
He owes $2,700.
And second, you kill Cheese...
and we're gonna have a fight
with his people, right?
A year down the road...
some nigger sees my cousin
coming out the burger shop...
putting gas in his car on Central Avenue,
no questions, puts a cap in his ass.
He's smart, huh? Niko, smart.
We don't have the muscle
to go talk to this guy, make things right.
I was hoping maybe you do.
Mr. Little...
can I ask why you came forward
in this case?
-I told the police what I know.
-Were you offered anything in exchange?
-Like what?
-Were you arrested?
Were you going to be charged with a crime,
and by testifying...
did the police agree to drop those charges?
No, man, it ain't even about that.
How many times have you been arrested
as an adult, Mr. Little?
Shoot, I done lost count.
Enough, though, not to take it personal.
Possession of a handgun...
possessing a concealed weapon,
assault by pointing...
robbery, deadly weapon,
possession of a handgun again...
followed by violation of parole
on weapon charges...
followed by
one count of attempted murder...
and use of a handgun
in commission of a felony.
That wasn't no attempt murder.
What was it, Mr. Little?
I shot the boy Mike-Mike
in his hind parts, that all.
Fixed it so he couldn't sit right.
Why'd you shoot Mike-Mike
in his hind parts?
-Let's say we had a disagreement.
-A disagreement over?
Mike-Mike thought he should keep
that cocaine he was slinging...
and the money
he was making from slinging it.
I thought otherwise.
So you rob drug dealers?
This is what you do.
Yes, sir.
You walk the streets of Baltimore
with a gun...
taking what you want, when you want it...
willing to use violence
when your demands aren't met.
This is who you are.
Why should we believe
your testimony then?
-Why believe anything you say?
-That's up to y'all, really.
You say you aren't here
testifying against the defendant...
-because of any deal you made with police.
-True that.
That you are here
because you want to tell the truth...
about what happened to Mr. Gant
in that housing project parking lot.
Yup.
When in fact you are exactly
the kind of person who would...
if you felt you needed to...
shoot a man down
on a housing project parking lot...
and then lie to the police about it,
would you not?
Look, I ain't never put my gun on no citizen.
You are amoral, are you not?
You are feeding off the violence
and the despair of the drug trade.
You are stealing from those who themselves
are stealing the lifeblood from our city.
-You are a parasite who leeches off...
-Just like you, man.
...the culture of drugs.... Excuse me? What?
I got the shotgun. You got the briefcase.
It's all in the game, though, right?
And with the economy, what it is...
you can really consider coming in
10% or 20% below asking...
and still feel competitive.
-Even on the Hamburg Street address?
-Absolutely.
I have to admit, I like the house at 1501 .
Although I didn't like the color
of the whirlpool tub...
in the master suite bathroom. Magenta?
-That's cosmetic.
-If they want to make the sale...
they should have some amount
of couth to change the color.
I know it's such a tiny point to harp on.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we should just keep looking.
We shouldn't settle for just anything.
And you think that there will be
some new open houses this Sunday?
-I'm sorry, what were you saying?
-We're gonna keep looking.
-You'll take us around again on Sunday?
-Definitely.
-Okay then, see you Sunday, early.
-Great.
Thank you.
I'll see you then.
You are a child, you know that?
-What do you want?
-Dinner and a movie.
-Come on, stop it.
-Why not?
This isn't going anywhere, Jimmy.
Dinner and a movie,
then I'll walk you to the door...
and you tell me to go fuck myself
like you should've done way back when.
How about I tell you to fuck yourself
here and now?
Then you can save that money
for someone else.
Come on, Elena.
Come on, I signed all your damn papers.
Give me another shot.
Friday. You pay for the sitter.
-So how that D.C. game, man?
-Same as it ever was.
Chocolate City, I ain't been there in a while.
Call it Drama City nowadays.
Otherwise, same old gogo. Same old Bamas.
Same soup, just reheated,
know what I'm saying?
If you need anything to make this happen,
you gotta get it yourself.
I can't go through my people.
If Stringer Bell reaching
all the way past Baltimore...
with this kind of work...
then we got a real mystery
going on, don't we?
Don't worry, no mistakes.
Nothing that might come back on you.
-You sure of your people?
-My cousin up in there...
-he on it.
-All right.
I can't stand that gogo shit, anyhow.
Ain't heard it live, then.
I know a club in Oxon Hill
that would wreck y'all.
All right.
If I'm around the way.
So, how you doing?
-Nursing school right now.
-Good, that's good.
Lester's been pushing me, you know.
He does it, kind of without you knowing
that he's doing it.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
He said that you would be by today
to talk about the clubs.
About some girls, Russian.
-Or from that part of the world.
-The ones on the circuit, yeah.
You should try this place called Nightshift
down off of Holabird.
I have a friend who works there.
She worked with a bunch of Russian girls
last year for about three months.
-Think she'll talk to me?
-Only if I ask her.
Thank you, Detective, nothing further.
-Anything more on redirect, Miss Nathan?
-No, Your Honor.
Let's take 10 minutes
and then run the closing arguments.
I have every intention
of beginning tomorrow...
with jury instructions.
-How'd Omar do?
-You didn't see it?
Not the cross. That bad?
-You have no problem.
-No?
To start, he wants you to pay $5,400.
Then we talk.
-He says, "No, you pay just the $2,700."
-Yeah, I saw how you talked.
But you will not pay the $2,700.
Instead you will get the money
for the car that burned.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
Him we don't know.
But the one he calls boss, him we know.
You gonna sit there and pout?
I know you don't think I'm going down
to that club just to look at pussy.
I know you know me better than that.
-I ain't even looking.
-Everybody's looking.
-Most of them women are dykes.
-Cheryl, it's police work.
What, so that's supposed
to make me feel better?
Kima's out on the street
doing her detective thing?
All that hospital shit, all that rehab...
-all them promises--
-We talked about this.
No, you talked.
I didn't get a word in edgewise
once you made up your mind.
I didn't get a word in edgewise
once you made up your mind.
-Where you going?
-With you.
Excuse me?
Who knows? I might see a little something
I happen to like.
So all of that's on the table?
There's money in the transport budget
for the grain pier.
Also, a bond issue that pays
for maintenance dredging...
on the main shipping channel.
-But not the canal?
-Nope, not the canal.
For that we'll have to fight
a little longer and dig a little deeper.
So says Frank.
I gotta say, for my money,
we're lucky if we pull out the grain pier.
Be that as it may,
we spent the money and took our best shot.
Hired a couple lobbyists,
made some smart contributions...
paid for a consultant's report...
to argue against
some of the environmental stuff.
It cost, but we're starting to see it.
-So where y'all find the cash?
-I've been robbing liquor stores, two a week.
Seriously.
We got some help
from the national office on this.
There've been some timely donations
from a few friends here and there.
The point is, at the very least...
we're likely to see
the grain pier back up by next year...
which means a couple hundred
more ships a year, at least.
-If.
-And it's a big fucking "if."
-If that Polack motherfucker--
-Hey.
No offense.
If Krawczyk don't fuck us by throwing up
waterfront condominiums first, right?
Nat's right. The back door threat
is that Andy Kraw or some other developer...
gets enough last-minute votes
to sink the rehab money for the grain pier.
Those guys are looking at that location, too.
So we need everybody making phone calls.
Let your legislators know
that we're watching on this.
The money only goes so far.
Now we gotta make some noise, right?
-Make some noise.
-Okay, enough talk.
Some of youse got ships
to work in the morning.
-The rest of youse need to be drunk.
-I'll drink to that.
Help from the national office, huh?
Timely donations from friends?
Watch your ass, Frank.
-This is it?
-Yeah.
Just picked it up
from the port administrator.
So what am I looking at?
The Atlantic Light on the day
the can with the women was offloaded.
The boxes are containers.
This one's being offloaded
and set on a chassis.
Here's the time: 10:31 hours.
See? It was moved to Lane L,
Stack 6, Row 3...
by an RTG at 10:37 hours.
-RTG?
-Rubber tire gantry.
So from ship to stack took six minutes.
That's the way it's supposed to work, but....
"AQQZ," as in zebra...
"396594."
Check digit, seven.
That's the container number
of the can with the women in it.
See that?
It was never entered by the checker.
So as far as the computer is concerned,
it no longer exists.
Sobotka says that that can happen
when the radio waves get knocked down...
or when a checker inputs
a bad serial number.
It came off Atlantic Light at 1 1 :26 hours.
And it doesn't show up
in the computer again until 15:1 2 hours.
I find it two hours after that.
So for nearly four hours,
it's out on the docks, unaccounted for.
Sobotka says cans get lost all the time.
When they get found,
they get put back into the computer.
You believe him?
No, not this can.
So what's the plan?
The database on this computer...
has records for every ship
that berthed at Patapsco...
over the last two years.
We gotta go back through
and find what other cans...
might've disappeared like that.
-See if there's a pattern.
-How many ships we talking about?
Hundreds.
It ain't like I got a prayer of bringing
this case in otherwise.
-That's what I'm talking about.
-All right.
-What the hell is your problem?
-Nothing.
Yeah, you look like you about to be sick
or something.
I just can't look at them.
Prez, you ain't never been to a titty bar?
Yeah, sure. But not with women.
You're sure you're not gonna have
a problem for talking to us?
I don't give a shit.
You friends with Shardene, all that matters.
Besides, I'm from Westport,
and I told them club owners straight-up...
I was here before them ho's got here...
and they better make sure
I'm here after they leave.
-So how long ago did they came through?
-Six months back was the last batch.
Russians, I think,
but shit all sound the same...
when you can't understand
a damn word, right?
-Who brought them?
-Club owner pays extra for them.
There was a woman...
she was like the madam
who handled the cash.
-But I ain't get a name.
-She Russian, too?
She was something. She had an accent.
So it's like, one day all Baltimore girls
are at the bar...
and the next, what?
-All foreign girls?
-That about right.
They was making so much money
with them new girls...
they let some of their regular dancers go.
Not me, 'cause I mean, I got clientele here.
-But some of the others....
-Where'd the girls stay?
Where they told. Shit, they ain't here legally.
They don't know shit.
They ain't got no family.
The men they got handling them
are always with them.
Right there to take them
from whatever motel they use...
to the club and back.
Right there when they need to get food,
or go to the Rite Aid.
Right outside the motel door
when they up in them rooms with the johns.
Anyone try to get away?
Shit, I seen one of them get lit up
with one of them stun guns...
for going down the block
to get some dinner.
They barely let them girls
go to the bathroom by themselves.
And if they see one getting
too close to the johns...
that's when they move the whole crew
to another town.
Keep it so they don't get no help.
You up after the next song.
Push my numbers then.
I gotta go get paid, honey.
You need anything else, you can call me.
Help if I can.
I'll tell Shardene you said hi.
She must be doing good,
to be out for so long.
She must've landed a rich one, right?
-You her girl?
-Yeah.
I wouldn't let mine come in here either
without me.
These bitches in here are no joke.
Thirteen of them.
They had about a third of that space
hidden behind the fake wall.
A few flashlights, some junk food,
some water.
A portable toilet they had to share.
And not enough air.
I'm going to schedule sentencing
for the third week of next month.
Anything else today?
Your Honor, my client,
having preserved the necessary grounds...
for appeal in the record,
wishes me to state unequivocally...
that regardless of this jury's verdict...
he is the victim of wholesale perjury
on the part of the state's key witness.
We ask that an appeal bond be set...
so that he can participate fully
in this investigation.
An appeal bond on a conviction
of first-degree murder?
-Mr. Levy, get a grip on yourself.
-Your Honor--
Not only will there be
no bond pending sentencing...
but as far as I'm concerned...
the pre-sentencing report
is a mere formality.
Mr. Hilton has been found guilty
of killing a state's witness...
who testified in this very courtroom.
He did so in cold blood, and for pay.
Unless the pre-sentence report
indicates that he is, in fact...
the Messiah come again...
he will very likely be sentenced
to life, no parole...
by a Baltimore judge who,
for once in his life...
gets to leave his office feeling
that his job actually matters.
Mr. Hilton, are you the second coming
of our savior?
-Excuse me?
-Are you Jesus Christ come back to Earth?
See you at sentencing.
Was it good for you, too?
Mr. Little, this is good to get-out-of-jail-free
one time only...
on anything up to aggravated assault.
-Why thank you, ma'am.
-No, thank you.
A rare pleasure.
Time for the ceremonial eyefuck.
Come see me down the Cut,
you punk-ass snitch.
I'll shove a shiv down
your cocksucking throat!
You think on it, Bird.
You think on Brandon
while you doing that time?
I'm gonna see you, man, I swear to God!
Fuck that, I'll do you like a dog.
You really see him shoot the man?
You really asking?
But it's fucked because the man
got to where he needed to be...
and she wasn't even worth it.
Daisy wasn't nothing past any other bitch,
anyway, you know?
And he did all that for her and in the end,
it ain't amount to shit.
Fitzgerald said that
there were no second acts in American lives.
-Do you believe that?
-Man, shit, we locked up.
We best not believe that, right?
He's saying that the past is always with us.
And where we come from,
what we go through...
how we go through it, all that shit matters.
-I mean, that's what I thought he meant.
-Go ahead.
Like at the end of the book, you know?
Boats and tides and all.
It's like you can change up, right?
You can say you're somebody new,
you can give yourself a whole new story...
but what came first is who you really are...
and what happened before
is what really happened.
And it don't matter
that some fool say he different...
'cause the only thing
that can make you different...
is what you really do
or what you really go through.
Like, you know,
like all them books in his library.
Now, he fronting with all them books...
but if we pull one down off the shelf,
ain't none of the pages ever been opened.
He got all them books,
and he ain't read near one of them.
Gatsby, he was who he was,
and he did what he did...
and 'cause he wasn't ready
to get real with the story...
that shit caught up to him.
I think, anyway.
Sorry, homey.
You done with your trial?
-All right then, let's take her on out.
-Tomorrow.
-I'm back with you tomorrow, Diggsy.
-You got something else to do today?
Yeah, last bit of business.
-This is your business.
-This is retirement.
And after today, I'm retired.
Talk when I say, not before.
-Tovarich.
-Serge, my nigger.
-You're losing weight.
-Shit.
You are down to nothing.
In this country, supermarkets are cathedrals.
-I worry for you, buddy.
-How your peoples, dog?
Same, good.
You talk to the man
about that other thing, right?
Because I can get behind
that business in a big way.
-We will talk later. Now, another business.
-Right.
This the man with the raggedy-ass Camaro?
Wasn't mine, it was my cousin's.
It wasn't all that raggedy.
Sorry. Nicky is with us. His cousin....
But family cannot be helped.
Who you telling?
I got motherfucking nephews and in-laws
fucking all my shit up all the time.
And it ain't like I can pop a cap in their ass
and not hear about it Thanksgiving time.
For real, I'm living life
with some burdensome niggers.
So what the fuck?
You ain't pay my boy Cheese,
and Cheese ain't paying me, right?
I ain't talking
about all the money in the world.
But it ain't like Cheese be in a position
out on that corner...
to let your cuz exemplify shit, you feel?
The man cut you some slack...
and soon every fucking-up white boy
be on his titty.
We wanna pay what we owe.
The $2,700 anyway.
-We're gonna have it soon enough.
-Your man doubled it, though.
He also burned the car.
Now the blue book
on that Camaro was $5,100.
Now, let me understand.
You gonna come up in here,
having fucked up a package...
asking me to tell Cheese,
who you fucked it up on...
to pay you out $2,400.
He gets to keep the Camaro.
Just how good a friend
is this motherfucker to y'all?
The Cheese ain't gonna be happy
having to pay me back...
so I would advise y'all
to give him some distance.
Just so he don't come back on my cousin.
Anyway, thanks for being straight on this.
Fool, if it wasn't for Serge here...
you and your cuz both would
be cadaverous motherfuckers.
I went through INS, customs,
even the State Department. Nothing.
It's time, Jimmy.
You did what you could, right?
Yeah, fuck it, let her go.
This one to the anatomy board
in the morning.
Jane Doe on the paperwork.
-Ain't right, Doc.
-What the fuck ever is?
You leave it to Avon...
he's gonna get some years
off your sentence.
No doubt, knowing Avon.
It's all good, D.
Just show up,
and say what Levy tells you to.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I'm asking you.
Those hot shots, that was Avon.
I want you home, D.
You asked me to carry this. I'm carrying it.
-This is mine, right here, right now.
-Boy, you ain't listening to me.
-I am telling you--
-Ma.
You remember we used
to lived on Linden Avenue?
Remember that house?
I was about 6 or 7 years old.
I was playing on the porch.
Them twins came by,
started picking on me, messing with me.
Remember that?
I'm banging on the door,
trying to get inside...
and you standing right there
to open the door...
except you ain't letting me inside.
You told me to go back out there
and fight them...
whether I lose or not.
Remember?
-They beat the shit out of you.
-Yeah.
Then you say to me:
"Boy, I might have brung you
into this world...
"but you the one
who gonna have to live in it."
Ma, I'm still here.
Me. You gotta let me live like I need to live.
You tell Avon, Stringer, and Donette...
all of them, to leave me be.
All right, look, fuck y'all. I need a drink.
-Come on, we're almost through 2002.
-No.
-Tomorrow is another goddamn day, right?
-Yeah.
They look thirsty, a round on me.
Yo, Mr. Sobotka,
friend to the working man...
master of the game.
How many votes we get down
in Annapolis tonight, Frankie?
-Been here long?
-Since my hair was brown.
I was telling Chess about Benny.
-Benny with the harelip?
-That's a good one.
See, Benny was working the hole
and he got hit with a shackle.
Chunk of steel clocked him good,
but he didn't tell nobody.
Not until he came in here.
That's when Little Nose told Benny
to call the union lawyer.
-Paul Sevel?
-Yeah.
God rest his soul.
So Benny calls Paul.
"Me been hit with a 'ackerel," Benny says.
"A mackerel?
"You working frozen foods again?"
Paul says.
"No, 'oddamn it, a 'ackerel."
Then he slams the phone down.
"'Other'ucker on 'is way over 'ere.
"Says he can't undertan' me."
Little Nose says, "Why he wanna do that?
"Benny don't talk
no fucking better in person."
So that's it? Me and Cheese are straight?
Yeah, you're straight.
That there's $2,400 for Princess.
She was worth more than that.
Dolo. One for the bar, hon.
You win the lotto?
If my old man can do it,
who the hell says I can't?
-What the fuck is wrong with you?
-Nick, when I'm flush, I'm flush.
-We ain't gonna live forever, right?
-Next round's on me.
-Not for me, I'm gonna head out.
-Come on, Frank, belly up.
Take a rain check.
-And that one as well, huh?
-Makes 22.
All on the Talco line.
All with Horseface Pakusa working the ship.
-We're on it then.
-You gonna call Bunk?
Detective Moreland is indisposed.
-You with Daniels and them?
-No.
We just parked the computer down there.
We're orphaned, man.
-Orphaned?
-Yeah.
Rawls is talking like...
if I don't come home with 14 clearances...
I can't come home at all. Lester, too.
Where's the love, Jimmy?
Where is the motherfucking love?
-So what's up with you, man?
-Nothing.
Nothing, huh?
I'm done, Bunk.
Bird is my last piece of old business.
I got nothing new.
I was trying for an ID on this one...
and I can't even tell you why.
Just a way to pretend
I was still a murder police, I guess.
Who gives a fuck, right?
Elena and I are gonna try again.
Shit.
I'm done fucking myself up, Bunk.
I am done.
Come on, man, let's go home.
All right, man.
Over here, shitbird.
What the hell happened to you?
-I fell down.
-How many times?
Let's walk.
-Pop, I'm--
-Walk with me, Zig.
Votes break for us,
that pier comes back online by next spring.
-More ships, more work.
-Yeah, great.
-What the fuck are you about?
-What?
Is that my son lighting
hundred dollar bills like an asshole...
in a bar full of working stiffs?
-What the fuck is that?
-Just a smile.
-A smile?
-Yep, a smile.
You wanna hit me again, Pop,
go ahead, take a shot.
Where you come by that kind of cash?
You know you ain't had the days.
Definitely not.
It's 'cause my father's in the union.
Fuck that.
It's 'cause my father's in the union.
Fuck that.
Seniority prevails, Zig.
-It's the only way to keep it halfway honest.
-I know, I ain't complaining.
I wish I could give you more.
You don't think I want to throw you more?
-You throw plenty.
-It's just, Christ, Zig.
If I'd listened to your mother,
she's the one always talking about--
It's cool.
You should do community college
like your brother.
Pop, don't.
You wanna know what I remember?
Do you?
I remember you, and Uncle Jerry...
and Uncle Walt Pe-Pop...
all sitting around the kitchen table,
talking shit about this gang and that gang...
who's better with the break-bulk...
who could turn it around faster, who's lazy.
-Always a fucking argument, right?
-Four Polacks, six opinions.
I remember when youse all
went down to picket them scabs...
at Covington Piers...
how Jackie Taylor got run over
by a police car...
in the middle of that whole goddamn mess.
I remember when the Paceco
fell during that windstorm.
You remember, right? Killed Fat Rick dead.
Yeah, what else you remember?
Everything.
So tell me, Mr. "Back ln The Day"...
what are we doing down here
with the wharf rats...
in the middle of the goddamn night?
Beats the fuck outta me.
Every one of those Post-its
is a can that disappears...
when it's being offloaded.
The yellow slips, they show up again...
with legitimate cargo intact
and are re-entered...
so you figure those are honest mistakes.
But the pink and the green,
those cans never come back.
They stay out of the computer for good.
And the pink one,
like the can full of dead girls...
they're all from
the same shipping line, Talco...
and on all of them, the same checker,
this guy Thomas Pakusa...
he goes by Horseface, he's the one working.
You went at him already, right?
We grand juried his ass,
but that motherfucker didn't blink.
You wanna hit the head?
Get yourself right, Detective?
No, I'm good.
The point is, we have a pattern here.
What they're doing eliminates
almost all of the paper trail.
As long as they can get
a truck past the outbound lanes...
and there's a dozen ways to do that,
the only thing they leave behind...
is a little telltale in the computer.
A box comes off the ship,
flashes for a few moments and blip...
then it's gone.
Our target
is supposed to be Sobotka, right?
I mean, on paper anyway.
What you're telling me is
that it's better than a fair bet...
that he actually is
a target in Bunk's murders.
Maybe we can fold our investigation
into yours, Lieutenant.
And put my ass in the air with
14 open homicides that might never clear?
-The bosses wouldn't blame you for that.
-I wouldn't shine either.
I'm using what we do with this detail
to get a major case squad going.
I come up out of here with all those
open files, it doesn't smell as sweet.
-So what's the next move on this?
-We clone the computer...
and start watching
what's happening on the docks in real time.
Shit.
Yo, D.
Just wine, huh?
I'm not drinking much anymore.
No Jameson's?
Maybe a quick fuck with the waitress, then.
Okay, I deserve that one, too...
even though I'm not doing
much of that anymore either.
-Anything else?
-I'm sorry.
I don't know where it still comes from.
It's been a year.
-You deserve to be angry.
-What's the point, though?
How's work?
What, so we talk about
everything in my life...
that pisses you off?
-Drinking, women, the work?
-Just trying to make conversation.
-I retired.
-Excuse me?
It's boats, not bodies.
On a good day,
I catch crabs and count seagulls.
-That's not you.
-It wasn't me.
It wasn't me not to drink,
or dog around either.
A lot of things weren't me.
I want another chance.
How about a fuck for the road instead?
-How you doing?
-Okay.
You unload this,
you gotta ditch trucks and trailers both.
Make it look like it was a hijack, all right?
Niko.
If you want, I will pay you straight...
or Eton can pay in heroin.
Wholesale.
Turn it around,
you can make $60,000 or $70,000.
Nicky, he's offering, like,
three, four times the value.
I'm out on this.
Nick, even if we walk it up to White Mike...
we can make $30,000 or $35,000.
Nicky, come on, man.
Half in cash, half in dope.
Nicky, I can turn that package around,
no problem.
-No, Zig, I got it.
-Nicky, you don't know--
You hear me? I said I fucking got this one.
Stay at home and watch cartoons.
Let me handle this shit
for the both of us, all right?
You fucking walking home or what?
Hey, girl.
-What do we do with the day?
-Me?
-I gotta pick up the boys from the sitter.
-Okay, great.
They're gonna be coming back here.
Michael has piano this afternoon.
No problem, we'll do something after that.
Maybe we go by my place,
pick up some things.
I don't want the boys to know
that you were here.
It's gonna get them hoping.
So you need to leave.
Look at this sorry shit.
Motherfuckers not appreciate
nothing that comes to them free.
I'll take it in the back.
Maybe they got some duct tape to fix it.
-D, right?
-Yeah.
You can't be in here now, man.
Yo, man, y'all get any final calls
this week, yo?
-Yeah, we got some.
-I didn't see any out there.
All right, give me a minute.
Let me finish up right here real quick,
and I'll go and get one for you.
-Hey, y'all.
-What's up?
I know you got my motherfucking cigs, yo.
-You trying to curb me, yo?
-Come on.
What's in there?
Something in particular?
-Funeral.
-I'm sorry.
No, funeral, you know?
No, I mean, I'm sorry for your loss.
Yeah.
That's a popular one.
-Who was it that passed, a relation?
-No, we worked together.
-I see. A professional relationship.
-Yeah, professional.
I mean, we wasn't all that tight,
but he was still my nigger.
I think I'm on it. Follow me.
Hell, yeah, this what I'm talking about.
That gat and grip thing
over there sells a lot.
We can do that in white,
or red, or pink carnations.
-Pink?
-Your boy was too fierce for the pink?
No, he wasn't all that.
But when you stand with a nigger,
you stand with him to the end...
otherwise you ain't nothing yourself.
True that. How did your boy fall?
Hung himself.
Over at The Cut, strung himself up.
Judge ran wild on his ass, gave him 20.
I guess he couldn't handle
all those years, you know?
It's a weak-ass nigger
when you think about it.
But it ain't no reason to drag
his name down no further, you know?
I'll tell you what.
Let me get something in strong colors.
Red, black, whatever.
But make it look like one of the Towers...
down on Franklin Terrace.
You know, the high-rises.
You want the arrangement
to look like a high-rise housing project?
Hell, yeah.
And put the numbers 221
in big-ass numbers on the front.
All right? He used to have that
Fremont Tower for a while.
221, all right.
Anything else you want it to say?
Like what?
"Rest in peace," "In Remembrance,"
something like that?
Something that says
how you feel about the loss.
Look, man, fuck it, all right? Just....
Just make sure the Towers
look like they do, all right?
All right. Thanks.
-You cloned a what?
-A computer.
We can watch how the cargo
comes off the ship in real time...
try to follow the contraband,
see where it leads.
We're running a 25-murder-a-month
MASH Unit here...
and you guys wanna slow things down a bit,
and do a bit of brain surgery.
If Rawls comes walking through here
and sees the two of you hunched over...
playing video games on 14 open murders,
he's gonna blow!
That is exactly why we asked Lt. Daniels...
to set us up at his off-site,
over in the southeast.
They're looking at the dock boys
for other shit, drugs mostly.
-Daniels, who used to be in Narcotics?
-Yeah.
If Daniels has a detail set up already,
maybe he takes the murders, too.
He ain't no fool, Jay.
He's just giving us a room with no view.
That was approval, right?
He gave approval to go ahead with this.
I don't know.
What's next?
Next is for us to get them dock boys
back to thinking that we've gone away.
I mean, we spooked them right good
with that grand jury shit.
If we're gonna set up on them,
they need to think...
we ain't gonna be a problem no more.
How are they gonna think that?
No, see, that ain't the way it works.
It ain't.
'Cause I'm the one out here all day
taking the chance, right?
Police roll up into this bitch,
it ain't gonna be you that catch no charge.
So, least-wise, the thing you need to do...
is lay all that good shit
down on an even split.
Come Friday, me and my niggers
done sold all that shit off...
you come past and get paid.
That's how I'm at with it.
Hey, Frog.
Come here.
No, seriously. Come here.
First of all,
and I don't know how to tell you this...
without hurting you deeply...
first of all, you happen to be white.
I'm talking raised-on-Rapolla-Street white...
where your mama used to drag you down
to St. Casimir's...
just like all the other
little pisspants on the block.
Second, I'm also white.
Not hang-on-the-corner-
don't-give-a-fuck white...
but Locust-Point-l.B.S.-Local-47 white.
I don't work without no fucking contract...
and I don't stand around
listening to horseshit excuses...
Iike my cousin Ziggy, who, by the way...
is still owed money by you
and all your down, street-wise whiggers.
You go in your pocket,
come up with $500 in advance...
and the $210 that you owe to Zig...
you can work my package.
This is the shit you had out here last week.
The dimes that Moochie was slinging?
The shit was good. Moochie sold out quick.
All right.
I'm saying, I'm gonna send
my man around with the dollars.
-Keep it real.
-Whatever.
-Everything to your satisfaction?
-Yeah, you on it.
Prison people taking it that
that boy hung his own self, right?
Seems so.
My cousin always works clean.
None of my business, I know...
but did your man Avon even know about it?
You're on your own here?
You're right. It ain't none of your business.
And if I were you...
I wouldn't want a word of this mess
up in Avon's ear.
Baltimore niggers off the hook. I swear.
All y'all.
You better get up in this before it get cold.
This shit is good.
My man, that bullshit ain't on you.
It ain't, man.
Up in here, D knew he had to stand
on his own. You know this.
Man, fuck him.
He knew when he hung himself
how we was gonna carry it.
He knew when he did that, that we were
gonna be in a moment like this, right now.
He knew that.
That nigger did that shit to hurt me, man.
But, you know, man,
D was just fucking weak.
I tried to crimp him along
since he was a shorty, nigger.
I tried to bring him up, bring him along--
-You were real good to him.
-I was.
Man, it's sad, what happened.
That shit is sad.
But the boy almost
rolled on you that one time.
You know, he get to thinking
he can't do the years in here...
he might've could've rolled again.
Who knows?
I'm just saying...
it might've been for the best, you know?
His name is Head. Dick Head.
Check this out. Put your finger right there.
-Nice.
-Nice, right?
-Fellows.
-We need a bug.
Something that can stand up
to the pressures...
of the modern urban crime environment.
Let me show you.
Okay, fellows, this is the real deal.
Smaller than a 22.
And it's got a clear channel. Sturdy as hell.
You get this bad boy
within 10 feet of any conversation...
it sounds like Chuck Thompson
doing play-by-play.
-How much?
-$1,500.
But seeing as you're sworn officers,
the police discount drops it to $1,250.
-You in?
-Am I in?
The man just said $1,250, Herc.
Can we give it a test run?
A test drive in the modern
urban crime environment?
Yeah, leave me your credit card
and take it for 48 hours.
Change your mind, bring it back.
No problem.
-Let me consult my partner.
-Of course.
You got a credit card?
-Don't you?
-It's maxed to the max, man.
We've been doing
hand-to-hands for a while now...
and we ain't no higher up
on the ladder and on those corners.
We're just gonna use it for a couple days,
get what we need, and bring it back.
I gave your man some room, that's all.
You gave him a home.
Det. Moreland's target
looks to be the same as yours.
-No.
-Yes.
You could take these 14 homicides...
and turn that half-assed detail
you got going into something that matters.
I'll be honest. You solve the murders,
I'll love you for the stats.
And if you don't,
I've made it so the Homicide Unit...
doesn't have to bear the whole brunt
of a lower clearance rate.
It's win-win for me.
-No.
-Come on, Lieutenant.
A good turn here will not be forgotten.
I'm trying to dig myself out of the basement
with something simple and clean here.
Drug arrests,
maybe a prostitution bust if I get lucky...
and I'm out from under with Burrell.
Sorry, Colonel.
You keep the murders,
and my ass stays covered.
Smarter than he looks.
-Where's your friend?
-Who's that?
-The black fellow, the Homicide guy.
-Case is done, for all I know.
Yeah?
You all didn't go for nothing,
and no one on the ship did either.
So, he sent me back
and moved on to new business.
-So you back to the usual then?
-Yeah, the usual.
Except I won't be around Patapsco
or North Point much.
Starting tomorrow,
I'm down at the Fairfield Terminals.
Fairfield?
Yeah, bosses want another car
patrolling the chemical plants.
Because of terrorism, I guess.
You're too pretty
for the Fairfield Piers, darling.
You need to be uptown here with us.
You got stripes in the Southeast...
and can't pull Valchek's spy van
to work his own detail?
Man, I've never seen that thing.
-Snug.
-As a bug.
In a rug.
Let's go.
-This shit is hypnotic.
-Boring, too.
You make a show of it?
Let everyone working see me
in that radio car.
Is that the Valparaiso?
It ain't a Talco Line ship,
doesn't have Horseface working.
Probably wasting half a day
watching it offload.
-Yeah, we should be at the bar by now.
-Nothing's wasted.
I've been getting a feel for this shit.
How it plays and works without the dirt.
-So when they lose a can--
-I see it go.
Gentlemen. Ladies.
The future is now.
To bring goods
to an exploding global economy...
and to deliver those goods faster,
cheaper and safer...
modern robotics do much of the work
in the world's largest seaport, Rotterdam.
Moving cargo is a traditional
strength of the Dutch...
who shuttle more freight in fewer man-hours
than any port in the world.
And now, the Dutch have modeled
the future of cargo management.
Completely containerized cargo
arrives and departs...
on ships a third of a mile long,
24 hours a day, with short turnaround.
Smart card technology
provides greater security...
and improved accountability, with no need
for unreliable human surveillance.
Frog, man, we light five caps is all, man.
I'm saying, you getting all ridiculous
over bits and pieces. You feeling me?
Nigger, it's the principle of the thing.
It's like you in a store working the register...
and at the end of the day,
the shitjust add up.
Mad Dog gonna roll through here tomorrow
with the re-up...
and I want to have the package
right for once.
Hey, Carver.
Isn't technology the fucking bomb?
...and global positioning systems
guide each container...
to its proper spot,
on board or on the docks...
while state-of-the-art-computers
track shipments in every part--
Some of the systems you're seeing
have already been upgraded.
Rotterdam now works
350 million tons of cargo annually...
Ieaving Singapore a distant second.
What kind of man-hours
are the stevedores clocking over there?
I don't have those figures handy. I'm sorry.
But Rotterdam does employ 4,000 people.
4,000 people to move
350 million tons a year?
-That's right.
-That's efficiency, Nat.
By eliminating
some of the more dangerous work...
the Rotterdam technologies have reduced...
employee work-related accidents
and injuries by 60%.
I think we can all be happy
with that, can't we?
Question? Yes?
The GPS readings, are they exact....
You can't get hurt
if you ain't working, right?
No, they work with all kinds of cargo,
in all kinds of weather.
Coming.
-Hey, Jackie.
-String. You, too?
We got enough food
for three weeks right now.
How's Brianna? ls she back there?
What's up, little man?
How you holding up?
Bri.
-Nicky boy, you get days this week?
-No.
Four ships on Thursday.
You could've pulled a day for sure.
That's your half on the last two packages,
plus what Frog owed you on your own shit.
It's all there, cuz.
-What the fuck is wrong with you, smiley?
-Nothing.
What did Frog say?
"Here's a couple of hundred extra,
make the little goof happy"?
The packages were my thing, Nick.
Fuck, if you ain't handle
that business better, too.
Zig, we're making money.
It's your move, Nicky.
Fuck it. I got other issues right now.
Paternity?
Priscilla Katlow.
Jesus, Zig. You knocked up Prissy Katlow?
I only fucked her once.
Christ, everybody down the point
fucked her the once.
How do you know it's yours?
You call this lawyer?
Figured I'd get drunk first.
That's a good plan.
-Russians?
-Lot of girls. Pretty ones.
Most of them had
some kind of accent anyway.
Shardene's friend hooked us up good.
Who's in charge?
You got the club people, I guess.
And there's some woman
I've seen go into the back room.
She looks a little bit older.
I couldn't get close enough
to say much about her.
She looks about 40.
Grab any ass, Prez?
What I'm saying is, I've sorted it out for us.
-I have.
-For us?
When I was in the basement,
it made sense to quit. It did.
But once Burrell reached out--
But Burrell is the one that you crossed.
He's not likely to forget that, is he?
Not to mention what he knows
about you from the bad old days.
Fools half your age
are gonna be Major and Colonel...
and you'll still think that
scratching out a case or two will save you.
It isn't about the casework, I know that.
Just today, Rawls calls me up to CID...
asks me to take his homicides from
the dead girls on that shipping container.
I told him, no shot. That case is a loser.
If I'm looking out for number one...
I'm gonna bring Burrell
exactly what he asked for...
and exactly what he needs
to make Stan Valchek go away.
No more, no less.
I'm playing their game this time.
Look, it's one thing you taking a run
at this dredging thing.
Fucked-up as you are,
we can let that slide for a while...
but now, you're asking too much.
One more year, Nat.
-Not for me, for the fucking union.
-The election's been scheduled.
You knew last year,
when we gave you the votes...
that this time would be Ott's turn.
You knew that.
So Ott runs next time.
He'll take that year and the next.
It's our turn, Frank.
Black, White, what's the difference, Nat?
Until we get that fucking canal dredged,
we're all niggers, pardon my French.
Or Polacks, pardon mine.
You know what I'm saying,
this ain't about Ott.
I just want one more year
to finish what I started here.
Then Ott stays Secretary-Treasurer
for the next two, no problem.
Think about it.
-Hello?
-Brucie, baby.
-Frankie Sobotka, how's it hanging?
-You talk to the presiding officers yet?
Lot of girls. Lot of muscle.
Zig, Jesus, get off me, you jerk.
-When did you get served with these?
-I got them in the mail this morning.
-In the mail?
-Yeah, this morning.
When Pokey Barber got hit with paternity...
a sheriff had to come to his house
and serve him with papers.
Dolores, can I use the bar phone?
-Who are you calling?
-The lawyer on this piece of bullshit.
What? Ain't no fucking law firm open
in the middle of the goddamn night.
Shyster, Shyster and Shyster.
-He got you, Zig.
-Who got me?
Maui?
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, born in poverty
Love child, never meant to be
There's no restroom in the lobby,
and if you're not an approved visitor...
I just don't have the authorization.
Okay.
Tell me something.
When you have to go, where do you go?
Excuse me, sir? Are you a resident?
Sorry. Wrong building.
Sixth floor, all of them.
Thomas "Horseface" Pakusa.
Slated to be the ship-runner
on Talco Line's Esmeralda.
ETA, noon tomorrow,
Berth 6, Patapsco Terminal.
-So we're on.
-We're gonna need help with surveillance.
On the docks especially,
since our faces are known down there.
I can reach out to Greggs and Prez, maybe.
Bring them in on it.
Should we tell the Lieutenant?
Right now, the less he knows
he's involved in the murder investigation...
the happier he'll feel.
New truck?
What the fuck,
we're making money here, right?
-Hell, yeah.
-For real.
This guy's some kind of supplier.
Snap some shots of the truck tags.
-You got more for me?
-I got ifyou got for me, right?
Got to say, your thing is tight.
Best around here in a long while.
Fuck!
I'm with you on this, man....
All right, dawg.
Come on, asshole,
what the fuck's wrong with you?
Keep it fucking moving.
Jesus Christ!
No!
I cleared it with KGA,
we'll be working off of Channel 6.
I cleared it with KGA,
we'll be working off of Channel 6.
Prez, you got the eyeball
on the outbound truck gate.
Need you to set up so you can move
in either direction on Broening Highway.
Bunk, you set up on Newkirk and Broening.
Me and Russell will be on the computer.
That leaves the terminal itself to Kima.
They might not know my face,
but I sure as shit can't hang down there.
I'm thinking I should borrow
that CG&E truck from Narcotics.
Slap on a hard hat, pick up a clipboard.
What if they're not sneaking anything off
this time? What then?
Tragically, you will have wasted another day
in a life you've already misspent...
in the service of the city of Baltimore.
-Nothing's alive in these, right?
-If they don't go hot to a truck...
you go back in the stacks
and bang on them to make sure.
I trust these Greek fucks with nothing.
-How you hanging?
-Good. I'm good.
You ain't been working much.
Stay close, Nick.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Jesus on the main line
Tell him what you want
Oh, Jesus on the main line
Tell him what you want
Jesus on the main line
Tell him what you want
Call him up and tell him what you want
Ifyou want salvation
Tell him what you want
Oh, ifyou want salvation
Tell him what you want
Ifyou want salvation
Tell him what you want
Call him up and tell him what you want
Oh, call him up, call him up
Tell him what you want
Oh, call him up, call him up
Tell him what you want
Call him up, call him up
Tell him what you want
Jesus on the main line
You did the 221?
Shit look tight.
Sorry for the loss.
You all sent him off right, though.
As good a homecoming as I been to.
-You been to your share, man, I know.
-No doubt.
Of course, this is neither the time
nor the place...
but I thought I might
get at you for a moment.
-Got a proposition here.
-Go ahead to the car, man.
Ain't exactly talking out of turn when I say...
that, uh, Westside dope
been weak for a while now.
Every dope fiend in the city knows that
Avon been putting out piss, calling it shit.
The thing is, y'all sitting on
some of the best real estate in the city.
The Terrace, the low-rises,
the avenue corners.
Respecting the fact that you're known
to have a way with your words...
when are you gonna tell me
something I don't know?
Let me put a point on it.
My shit is right, String.
I got dope coming straight into Baltimore,
and the shit is raw.
85, 90%. And you know it's true.
You got half the Westside coming over
to Fallsway twice a day...
because Eastside dope be kicking the shit
out of Westside dope.
-You connected?
-This shit is straight off the damn boat.
I ain't even going to New York
except for my coke. Ain't no need.
Thing is, y'all got the best territory,
and no kind of product.
I got the best product,
but could stand a little more territory...
so you see where this thing needs to go.
Now you know Avon fought real hard
for them Towers.
We took down the Rayford brothers,
Big Dennis Woodson, I mean--
This shit is just business, String.
Buy for a dollar, sell for two.
That's all it need be. You got the Towers,
I got what goes in them.
Later for all that bullshit.
-I'll talk to Avon.
-You do that.
Come on, I can read a budget summary.
There's nothing in there for dredging.
Shortfall in revenues.
The governor's looking to limit bond issues.
-But the grain pier is still in there.
-And the rest is just talk?
Talk is good, Frank. Talk is a start.
Talk is your fucking job description.
Yak. Yak. Yak. Blah. Blah. Blah.
That's like saying all the checkers do
is punch numbers into a computer.
Your son, the oldest one,
he goes to what school?
-Jason's at Princeton.
-Princeton.
And after he graduates,
he's gonna do what?
-Whatever he wants.
-Right.
You sent him to Princeton
to do whatever the fuck he wants.
You know, back when we were kids...
Danny Hare's father stole
a couple cases of cognac off a ship.
Except when he gets it home,
it ain't cognac, it's Tang.
-Tang?
-Just invented.
TV said it's what the astronauts drank
on their way to the moon.
-You drink it....
-You could be an astronaut, too.
All summer long,
that shit was all the Hare kids drank.
Tang with breakfast, Tang with lunch...
Tang when they woke up scared
in the middle of the night.
What do you think they grew up to be?
Stevedores. What the fuck you think?
Something tells me
Jason DiBiago will grow up...
and squeeze a buck
the way his old man did.
You're out of line, Frank.
My great-grandfather was a knife sharpener.
Pushed a grinding stone up
Preston Street to Alice-Ann...
one leg shorter than the other
from pumping the wheel.
Since he didn't want his sons
to push the goddamn thing...
he made sure my grandfather
finished high school...
and my old man went to any college
that would take him.
You're talking history, right?
I'm talking now.
Down here, it's still: "Who's your old man?"
'til you got kids of your own.
Then it's, "Who's your son?"
But after the horror movie I've seen today....
Robots!
Piers full of robots!
My kid will be lucky if he's
punching numbers five years from now.
While it don't mean shit that I can't take
my steak knives to DiBiago and sons...
it breaks my heart that there's no future
for the Sobotkas on the waterfront.
Here, Brucie. I think they're your size.
I'm operating under the assumption that
because of your relentless diligence...
the funding for the grain pier
is gonna pass the assembly.
But I'm also talking about the canal.
So you're gonna talk about the canal...
the Muldoons who run the old line state
are gonna talk about it...
until some day, some way,
that motherfucker gets dredged...
and we get some ships in here.
Bring it down!
-Got one that disappeared.
-Get the container number?
-1 1-37 to 1 2-14.
-Go ahead, Lester.
-We got one, you prepared to copy?
-Send it.
Zulu, Tango, Golf, Romeo...
9, 7, 3, 2, 6, 5, check digit 9.
Copy that, I've got it in the yard.
-1 1-99.
-11-99.
We got a live one. Be up.
-What am I looking for?
-Stand by on that.
Be advised, I've got a White male,
orange safety vest...
blue overalls.
He's hooking the truck onto the....
What do you call it?
Copy that. What next?
One of two things.
The driver takes it through checkout...
in which case it may be that Horseface
entered the wrong container number...
and they find it there.
Or it goes out to Bobtail Lane.
If it does that, they're doing the dirt.
1 1-37 to 1 2-14.
Kima, keep the eyeball
until it clears the yard.
Advise if it stops at the checkout point,
or goes straight out.
Copy.
1 2-14. He went around the checkout. Copy.
-11-37 to 11-99.
-99.
Target's coming at you, you see it?
I got him on Broening,
heading west towards the city.
Copy, 11-37 to 11-34.
-Target approaching your 20.
-1 1-34, copy that.
I got him going straight on Newkirk.
-He's all yours, Bunk.
-Copy.
-1 1-34, you got the eyeball.
-Copy.
-1 1-34.
-Go ahead, 34.
He went to ground off of Newkirk.
Some kind of warehouse.
Wait one. I'll swing back, get a 20.
Be advised, it is a warehouse.
Pyramid lnc. 5605 Newkirk.
Copy that.
Brianna, man, she putting it on you?
Avon, you knew he was using?
I seen it, but I didn't see it.
I mean, he came up off that shit...
then we did our thing with the guard,
and I thought....
Fuck.
We did our thing with the homegoing, man.
I mean, it came off nice.
-Yeah?
-Yeah, everybody showed.
-How did Brianna do?
-Rough.
Don't nobody want shit like this
to happen, man.
If I'd have known the boy was
gonna be doing shit like that...
-you know what I mean?
-What are the prison people saying?
That he just hung himself like that?
Just tied a rope around a knob,
and sat his ass down.
How the fuck you gonna stop a man
from doing some shit like that?
What are you gonna do?
Stay with him every damn minute,
every day you can?
He gonna find a way if he wants to.
It ain't on you.
It ain't on you. I would tell you if it was.
What's up with that other thing, man?
Still shit, man. Your man in Atlanta
don't know what raw is.
-We gonna discount it.
-Do I look like Kmart to you, man?
-I'm saying, I mean--
-What are you saying? That's ridiculous.
Re-package it and sell it off.
You know, Proposition Joe
came to the funeral.
Pulled me aside. He's got a smoker.
Everybody knows he's got a smoker...
and he wants to share,
if we cut him a slice of the Towers.
-You know, it's a thought--
-It's not even a thought, man. No.
Let me tell you something. We're gonna
get through all this, you hear me?
-I know.
-All of it.
Anything come out?
If there were girls in that can,
they're still inside.
-Your DNRs go where?
-Phones for dockworkers local.
Offices, personal phones
for a couple of union officials.
Look here, 9581737
is listed to Thomas Pakusa.
On February 4th, and March 16th...
our Mr. Pakusa received a call
from Frank Sobotka's cell phone.
And both times, he works
a Talco Line ship the next day.
And both times,
a can goes missing in the computer.
Pretty good argument for a conspiracy case.
-Conspiracy to do what?
-Smuggle shit.
Smuggle what?
For starters, how about bringing girls
here for purposes of prostitution?
-That one we know about.
-You need to do better for a wiretap.
Read your annotated code.
Wiretap Statute, Subsection 10, 406...
designates crimes where telephonic
communication can be intercepted...
in the great state of Maryland. Prostitution?
You mean, you can tap a guy's phone
if he's selling drugs...
but if he's selling women,
he's out of bounds?
That's the law.
Honey, I'm home.
Start looking at the two-bedroom joints.
-We can pay.
-How?
-Got a new job.
-Off the docks?
Three, four days a week.
Warehouse foreman for this Greek guy.
He owns an appliance store
down the avenue in Highland Town.
I can work it around the hours
that I pick up at the docks.
How much, Nick?
Come here.
Like $500 a week. Maybe more.
But steady. You know, we can count on it.
Between what you make
with them scissors and this...
we can pay down the truck
and still have enough left over...
for someplace nice out in the county.
$1,500.
$1,250, with the police discount.
It just couldn't stand up to
the modern urban crime environment.
All right, slow up. This is it.
It's listed to Nicholas Andrew Sobotka,
1485 Reynold Street.
-Sobotka?
-That's what it says here.
That mean anything to you?
Beavis, that's the name of the guy
we're supposed to be working.
Frank Sobotka.
But we got Nicholas.
How many fucking Sobotkas can there be,
even down here in Polack town?
-You know what this means?
-What?
It means old fuzzy Dunlop here
is somewhat worse for wear, I admit...
it's really gonna start paying off
as a confidential informant.
-No fucking way.
-Are you out $1,250?
Because linking a street-level drug connect
to our main target...
has to be worth $200 for starters.
Listen, if I try to register him,
Daniels will smell a rat.
He trusts you, Carv.
You got that trustworthy look.
It's you, Lester. Got to be you.
-Me?
-We need to bring in the Lieutenant...
his detail and all the manpower
and toys that go with it.
And Daniels listens when you talk.
You got the smell of wisdom
on you, brother.
-We all got roles to play.
-What's your role?
I'm just a humble motherfucker
with a big-ass dick.
You give yourself too much credit.
Okay, then. I ain't all that humble.
I'll be goddamned.
I swear to God, if he plays
that goddamn song one more time...
I'm gonna clock his ass good.
You can take him, Zig. He just looks big.
Who the fuck is he? All pussy.
You're a legend of the docks, Zig.
A fucking legend.
You think I can take him?
You can take him.
-Man down, berth five.
-Who?
New Charles.
-Ambo's on the way.
-Jesus Christ.
Night work with break-bulk. I hate this shit.
-You guys gonna move this thing or what?
-Jesus. Fuck.
Ain't supposed to move a guy
when he's hurt.
We'll remember that
when you hit the number.
Quit pulling your dicks
and get this thing off of me.
One, two, three.
Charlie, here. Take a drag.
That's the ambo you're hearing, Charlie.
Right over there.
Don't worry, kid, you're still on the clock.
Frank, how does the leg look?
-Which leg is that now?
-Sir, can you hear my voice?
Squeeze my hand.
Let's get him into the ambulance.
You need to clear the way for us, guys.
-And you followed the can?
-Right to the warehouse.
-Surveillance set up?
-Kima is on it tonight.
This case needs to be worked, Lieutenant.
I know it began for you as a bullshit detail...
but this Sobotka's into some shit
that needs to be worked by good police.
The DNRs, the cloned computer.
We've got the pattern.
Rawls came to me.
-Asked if I would take the homicides.
-You should.
Those girls in the can really suffocated.
They really died in that fucking box.
You pick this case up,
you might eat those open murders.
But you let it pass...
you got to ask yourself
how you want to live your day-to-day.
you got to ask yourself
how you want to live your day-to-day.
From the guys in 15-14.
He should be all right.
You know how he got the name
New Charles?
First day of work was the same day...
the Paceco dropped a hatch cover
on Charlie Bannion.
Had to clean up old Charlie with a shovel.
Ever since then, New Charles.
He's gonna lose the leg.
Where's the money from?
I got your murders.
But what I need from you, I get.
No bullshit, no arguments.
No arguments.
-You're wasting all the batteries.
-So?
Mom, he's wasting all the batteries.
You two get along
or I'm gonna take that tent down right now.
-Snitch.
-Punk.
-Squirrel.
-Mope.
-Shut up.
-Who teaches them this stuff?
It's my turn, you just had it.
Elena.
No.
I don't trust you.
I can care about you...
and I can want us to be friends...
and if you give me enough time, Jimmy...
maybe I will actually want you to be happy.
But how the hell
am I supposed to trust you?
Mom, quick, it's a spider.
It's a big, hairy one.
-Oh, my gosh.
-Come on, Mom.
But if the case does come together,
I would at least have Rawls as a rabbi.
It could still work for me.
Listen to yourself.
I love the job, Marla.
-I can't help it.
-The job doesn't love you.
You know what I love?
The mind that's always a step ahead of me...
the person who never stops
thinking it through.
That's what I fell in love with first.
Do you know what I fell in love with first?
Do you?
Your ambition.
Where did that man go?
Hi, we're not here. Leave a message.
Elena, you gotta talk to me.
Last call.
Why is she such a pain in the ass?
-Excuse me.
-Hey, pal.
It's all right. One more, please.
-Save some for the other customers, okay?
-Pour it!
-You ain't getting behind the wheel, right?
-There's a cab picking me up.
I'm looking you in the eye, Gus.
I'm telling you, I'm not driving a car tonight.
Bite me.
Yeah, coffee.
-What's with the hand?
-Just a scratch.
Get me some eggs, will you?
-Can I get a scrapple with that?
-You can get anything you want.
Oh, God!
Look at him, all high and mighty.
You ain't gonna let that shit ride, are you?
After what he did?
I'd truck his ass, if it was me.
He's built kind of solid, though.
Maui ain't all that.
It's the clothes that give him size, Zig.
-You think?
-His ass is candy, Zig.
You, you're the legend of the docks.
Truck him with your best punch
and then just walk the fuck away.
Officially, I've put us on the hook
for 14 open homicides.
So either we bring in a hell of a case...
or I'm as big a fool
as Col. Rawls thinks I am.
That sounded a little desperate.
Not entirely.
Lester, enlighten Miss Pearlman
as to the status of our investigation.
You said this case needed a drug connect
for a wiretap, right?
Come take a look at this.
That's the DNR log
on the phone listed to the warehouse...
where we tracked the suspect container.
It shows outgoing calls to numbers
that connect to Petey Dixon...
Proposition Joe Stewart,
and "White Mike" McArdle...
among other traffickers on the East Side.
Which supports surveillance of known
dealers coming and leaving the warehouse.
Also, some surveillance shots
and matching mug shot photos...
from Southeast DEU,
which tie White Mike to street dealers...
that we've already
made controlled buys from.
Assuming exhaustion,
that's one tap on the warehouse phone.
-What's your PC on the truck driver?
-Sergei Malatov:
resident alien, Ukrainian origin.
No criminal history here.
We ID'd him from the contract
on the DAC truck rental.
He was nice enough to give
the truck rental people his cell number.
And phone records show
a call placed to the warehouse...
at the time Kima observed him on the docks
using the cell phone.
Checking the DNR log's history...
we matched seven other calls
from that cell phone...
to dates and times when
a container disappeared from a Talco ship.
Anything else? Tap 2 feels a bit thin.
How about Nicholas Sobotka
of the 1400th block on Reynolds Street?
On a Cl's information,
Herc and Carver followed him...
from a drug meet
along the Fayette Street strip...
back to his parents'
South Baltimore row home.
When we ran that phone number
from that address...
through the DNR at our warehouse,
we got nothing.
But when we checked it against
the cell phone of our friend, Sergei...
-we got a couple of hits.
-Sobotka's your stated target, right?
This is a nephew, and from the look of it...
he's involved in street dealing
as much as smuggling.
But right now, this case feels like
a lot more than Frank Sobotka.
-No offense to Stan Valchek.
-Okay.
I admit, you've got PC.
On the warehouse phone
and on the trucker's cell phone, too.
Now what have you got for exhaustion?
Any possible informants?
-Nothing on the docks.
-No one we can buy weight with.
-Surveillance?
-That got us to the front door...
but it's not gonna get us
inside that warehouse.
Start typing. I'll call the judge.
Ham and cheese sandwich,
and one of them Frappuccino drinks.
-I hear Charles lost his leg.
-What?
Frappuccino? What the fuck is that?
He's all pussy, Zig. Cold cock him.
Take him, Zig. Now's the time.
What do you know?
The pissant's got some grapes on him.
Banana, too.
Fucking shit!
-Take us up.
-Son of a bitch! God damn it!
Fuck you!
You big, stupid, fucking oaf!
Fuck you, Maui.
You're the fucking wimp.
No, fuck you, Maui!
-Stay there.
-Fuck you!
God damn it!
Any of you fucks try to help him down,
you'll be up there with him.
Bad advice!
You motherfuckers gave me bad advice!
Shit.
-What the hell are you wearing?
-No one mentioned all the perks.
Lacrosse?
What, a brother can't run with a stick?
Jim Brown was an all-American midfielder
at Syracuse.
You putting yourself beside Jim Brown?
Lester, I'm just saying....
I thought you were born in pinstripes.
Lieutenant, I was under the impression
that when detailed against his will...
to some backwards-ass,
no-count, out-in-the-districts...
Iost-ball-in-tall-grass drug investigation...
a veteran police of means and talent...
can wear whatever the fuck
he damn well pleases.
Up to a point.
-Nice shot.
-Thank you.
It's a hell of a thing to take a downtown
police and lose him in a cross-town world.
Take that one over there.
I'm homesick already.
I don't know what you're laughing at.
You can kiss my ass.
You should see
what your boy tried to pull today.
Fucking Ziggy.
-What are you looking for?
-Can't find the fucking bills.
-End of the month, everything's hanging.
-We got anything for the Greeks?
Wednesday, the Caspia over at Patapsco.
Nicky'll go get the slips tomorrow.
Wednesday, the Caspia over at Patapsco.
Nicky'll go get the slips tomorrow.
No wonder I couldn't find them.
You use them as bookmarks.
Let me ask you something important.
You like fake tits? I can't decide.
Thus far, I'm undecided on fake tits.
I thought I knew what paperwork was.
But what you all go through,
to listen to someone else's phone calls....
You all cannot spell for shit.
Would we be police if we could?
-Who's the duty judge this week?
-Vanderwal.
You think he'll sign?
No problem, if you clean his garage first.
Or wash his windows, maybe.
Fucking Vanderwal.
Wash windows?
-Are these the affiants, Miss Pearlman?
-Yes, Your Honor.
Are you willing to affirm that
the information offered in this affidavit...
is entirely true
to the best of your knowledge?
Yes, Your Honor.
-Yes, Your Honor.
-Absolutely.
Upstairs, gentlemen.
Third floor, back bedroom.
Sash installation.
And then if you can give
the windows a wash.... Thank you.
It's a good thing I took the Sergeant's test.
-Fuck, my knee.
-Sorry.
-First name?
-First name: Francis.
Spell the last name on the account.
S-O-B-O-T-K-A.
Yeah, that's it. It's a business address.
-You've been flagged.
-Flagged?
It says right here on the computer.
Yeah? You're kidding me.
I don't have any more information
on that now.
Whatever, okay.
The check's on its way tomorrow.
Cross my heart.
Horse, if you don't pay your phone bill
for three months, what happens?
No phone.
Okay, so I'm 90 days late on my cell phone,
but they let me go...
even before I mail the check in.
I ask the nice lady in the billing department
why that is. You know what she says?
-I've been flagged.
-Flagged?
She says it's on the computer
when my account comes on:
"Do not disconnect for non-payment."
"Flagged," what the fuck is that?
What am l, special?
Maybe you been touched by an angel.
Told you, B.
Tumbleweeds be blowing
through this motherfucker.
-Like the fiends all cleaned themselves up.
-No, that ain't it, man.
Word is out,
we just selling dog shit up in here, man.
Damn.
-Pud, how we doing?
-Slow as a white man in slippers.
All right, later.
We dying 'cause these dusty-ass fiends
done found the real someplace else.
It's that bullshit, man.
You two got a reason to be here?
-We're just going about our business.
-Keep moving.
Fake-ass police.
Where he get that uniform at? Kmart?
He wouldn't even be all chest-out
if we had some people up in this bitch.
Shit is fucked up, man.
Damn, junior, you had a night.
Even for a legendary motherfucker
like yourself--
Drop it.
What is wrong with you, man?
'Cause Elena didn't open up the door
for your ass...
you just gonna let all this shit fly out?
Come on, Jimmy. Lighten up.
Come and get me.
So, you guys going for a wiretap
on that port case?
They got every swinging dick with a shield
on that detail but me.
You jealous, bitch?
I'd rather be back in Homicide.
I'd take your place in a heartbeat.
Why?
-That floater showing up in your dreams?
-No, it's not just her.
I mean, who am l, Captain Chesapeake?
I need to get off that boat, Bunk.
I need to do a case.
I mean, if I'm not gonna....
If I'm no good for....
If that's all you want, just go and ask Rawls.
-He'll put you on this straightaway.
-Yeah, why wouldn't he?
...after which I tell Horse
to go down the southeast lot...
and steal the most expensive thing
he can drive, which he does.
And we box it up
and ship it to every port you can name.
Where is it now?
Somewhere between New Orleans
and the West Coast.
How's that for your kid brother?
You said you were gonna
bring something over?
Just this.
Read it.
-What is it?
-A confirmation letter, like.
You know that labor position
on the port advisory board I told you about?
I put you up for it. You're on.
I'm on?
I ain't been union since they closed
the dry dock. How come I'm on?
The board chair and me,
we got a relationship.
You mean, you greased it.
The chairman,
he thought you'd be right for it, is all.
There's a stipend comes with it.
$200 a month, Lou.
When I get home at night, I just wanna
watch a ball game or something.
When I get home at night, I just wanna
watch a ball game or something.
I'm not up to go to no meetings or anything.
Christ, Lou,
you don't gotta go to all the meetings.
Just show up once in a while,
let them know you're alive.
That's not for me.
What's for you?
That shitwagon parked out front
needs a battery.
Or this kitchen here
has been rigged the same way for 25 years.
Whatever I got comes straight.
That's real noble, big brother.
Not noble. Right.
The shipbuilders' local goes belly-up,
and that makes you some kind of martyr?
The only difference between me and you...
-is you picked the wrong union.
-That ain't the only difference.
-If you were in my position--
-I'm not.
To tell you the truth, I'm glad
I don't have to make those kind of choices.
Come on, kid.
Sit down.
You really used to race pigeons
with my PePop?
We all did back then.
I gave one to a seaman
on a Dutch tanker one time.
He set her loose in the middle of the ocean.
Damned if she didn't find her way
back to Hull Street.
Which, by the way, is more than I can say
about your grandfather...
when he was in the bag.
How come they don't fly away?
His wings are clipped.
How much for this one, Mr. Diz?
Why don't you start out with pigeons, Zig?
You can train pigeons.
Them things got lice.
They bring the plague, for Christ's sake.
Thanks, Mr. Diz.
I tried. Rawls hates his guts.
-With reasons.
-But the thing of it is, Jimmy's dying inside.
He's a train wreck
unless he catches a real case.
-But good police.
-Always.
The thing of it is, Lieutenant...
Jimmy McNulty, when he ain't policing...
he's a picture postcard
of a drunken, self-destructive fuck-up.
And when he is policing...
he's pretty much the same motherfucker.
But on a good case,
he's running in front of the pack.
That's as close as the man comes
to being right.
Go back to Rawls.
So I get paid?
Yeah, you get paid, but you don't get paid.
We get paid.
Why don't they give you the money
and leave me out of it?
'Cause we need someone to be
Confidential lnformant Number 238...
registered with the department.
We get you registered, we get paid.
-So you're gonna send my picture--
-And your social security number.
And they give me money which you keep,
and I don't get nothing.
Cuz, did you do anything
to deserve the money?
Did you?
Yeah, we cracked a fucking case wide open.
We brought back
very significant information...
about a major drug trafficker.
That's what we did.
But that's your fucking job, right?
You get paid a salary for that.
Bernard, you're upsetting my partner, man.
What are you doing?
10%.
10% goes to me and I don't tell.
You don't tell
because your ma and my ma are sisters.
-That's why you don't tell.
-We're not even gonna use your real name.
You'll be registered as Fuzzy Dunlop,
a street name.
10%.
Wonderful, now I'm in business
with the whole fucking family.
It's payday, Zig. Once again.
All that?
We're rolling out there.
I can't hand this shit off fast enough.
Nice sled you got.
Zero percent interest. Money's cheap.
"Money's cheap"?
What the fuck does that mean?
It means I got a good deal, you peckerhead.
You should think of getting
some new wheels yourself.
Yeah, I'm gonna do that.
You gonna get a car,
you're gonna need some jack.
Worry about yourself.
I heard you took on Maui.
-Boy needed to get schooled.
-What are you, some kind of badass now?
-Yeah, it's me.
-Niko, things okay?
-Things are going great.
-Ifyou need more, talk to Sergei.
I gotta see you soon.
I'll call you back in a few, all right?
Is that the man?
-You don't have to concern yourself--
-I wanna meet him.
Let me handle the business.
I mean, you're getting paid, right?
Fuck you! I'll play the game for myself.
-Take the money, Zig.
-You don't think I can do it?
Pick up the fucking money, Ziggy.
-I don't want it. You pick it up.
-You.
Fuck you.
I was wondering about the La-Z-Boy chairs
I ordered. They come in yet?
-How many you ordered?
-That'd be three.
Your order's in.
-Yes?
-It's Nick.
How's it going?
I'm ready to talk about more, okay?
Youjust say where and when.
I'll call you back.
-Not as careful as Barksdale's people were.
-This ain't West Baltimore.
They are on their phones
because they don't expect us to be on them.
Let me shorten this conversation for you:
It's never gonna happen.
McNulty goes after it.
I could use someone like him.
And I could use three more inches of meat.
It ain't gonna happen.
You ever see how a dog gets
when he smells a bone buried in the yard?
Yeah, and I seen one
take a shit on my carpet, too.
And don't give me that he's-got-that-fire-
in-the-belly garbage, either.
The answer is no.
The answer is no.
What I need from you, I get.
-No bullshit, no arguments.
-What?
When I agreed to take these murders
for you, I made my terms clear, remember?
I need McNulty on this detail.
Jesus, Lieutenant. When I said "anything,"
I meant I'd let you have a kiss...
feel my tits or something, you know?
But not this.
You want me to clear those bodies?
See that you do.
Who they?
They might be some CBS boys
drifting from down south...
or might be some of Tavon's crew
from over on Edmondson.
This far over?
I know one thing, though.
-What?
-They're serving our customers.
-Marine unit, Diggins.
-I'm looking for McNulty.
McNulty, for you.
It's Daniels...
Get back to your office.
Thanks, Lieutenant.
This new generation with the names....
$150? Jesus.
He turned us onto
the Sobotka kid, Lieutenant.
This is the other half of the case, right here.
Three apartments on the sixth floor,
all leased out to Pyramid, lnc...
the same people
who own the drug warehouse.
Is this where the girls are staying?
Or something more?
No, the building's too nice
for room and board.
A building this nice is for the johns.
-Makes them feel safer.
-How do they bring them in? The lobby?
-Garage, probably.
-Either they have a garage card...
or they're being shuttled in
by someone who does.
You get that piece and you're in.
If the people running the girls...
are connected
to the ones running the drugs...
you can knock off the brothel
and then listen in on your wiretaps.
Tickle the wire like that.
Exactly.
Pleasure boats, topless women.
I'm telling you, now the weather's turned,
I gotta roll, Diggsy.
Thanks.
-We ain't be been paid since yesterday.
-And the day before that.
What the fuck?
Come on, dawg, are we back up or what?
We up, but we ain't in it.
What we got can't stand up
to what they moving down the way, so....
Boy, we about to dry up and blow away,
and shit.
Yo, man, I ain't got nothing for you.
How you gonna act like that?
Look, I feel you,
but I still gotta let you go so....
At least we get
some of that separation pay though, right?
Man, you better go on
before I lose my composure out this bitch.
These motherfuckers. Separation pay.
Separate your ass.
Assumption number one
is the people running the girls...
and the people running the drugs
are the same crew.
Assumption number two
is that the apartments in that condo...
are working as a cathouse
with those Russian girls.
Which means you have to get someone
in there undercover to make a case.
I'm thinking we need
a more subtle touch here.
I'd march into hell for you, Lieutenant.
You know that.
He doesn't look like he'd have to pay.
-Sorry, no. Domestic issues at home.
-Same for me.
Nadine would have them in a jar
by the side of the bed...
if she even heard tell of it.
What?
Takes a whore to catch a whore.
What the fuck did I do?
Give me a couple beers, Dolores.
Look at this.
I say, look at this.
Dolores, is that you?
Dolores, I'd like you to meet my attorney.
This is Steven L. Miles.
I may not be able to see through
all the bullshit in here...
but he can. So, if you will...
I'd like a stiff one for myself
and one for my counselor.
-Tell me he's a fake.
-That'd be lying, hon.
Is they real diamonds around its neck?
You sick, boy. You just sick.
Like I'm the only guy in South Baltimore...
that ever tried to win the affections
of a farm animal?
Enough talk. Now chop-chop.
I'd like one for the house and don't forget
to water my fine, feathered friend here.
If it's for the duck, the next round is on me.
Easy, there.
We're gonna need a saucer, hon.
Put some beer in it.
He needs a chaser.
Put it on my tab, Dolores.
Pace yourself. You're drinking
with the longshoremen tonight.
That look right to you?
Same truck as carried the girls,
same mope driving.
What about the passenger?
Looks the part to me.
Container ship on the Talco line,
name of Caspia, docks tomorrow a.m.
Our man Horseface on it?
I better call the Lieutenant,
let him know we gotta set up on this.
This time, though, we got the wire up.
Eyes and ears both.
There goes the shuttle.
What's he waiting on?
Getting himself all steeled up
to tell some tales.
Lying to the wife's easy.
It's looking your kid in the eye
that's the hard part.
Police!
Let's see your license.
"Robert Johnson." You believe that?
Bob, I'm very disappointed in you.
Wanna go home, Bob?
Okay, suppose a lonely fellow wants to meet
a nice young lady in this town.
How does he go about it?
He'd dial that phone number.
Dial the number. What else?
Punch in those four numbers there.
-And?
-Ask for Eve.
-What?
-Ask for Eve.
Go on, go home.
Godspeed, Bob.
-Johnson.
-My ticket to the dance.
Here we go. We got one.
1 2-14, Kima.
We got a disappeared can
just hit the chassis.
Affirmative. I'll eyeball it to the gate.
-Raise our boys.
-Right.
-What's Kima rolling as?
-Gas and electric.
-Yes?
-Everything's good.
-You coming in now?
-Yes.
White DAC truck coming at you
pulling a red can.
Serial Number: X-W-B, as in "boy"...
C-1-5-7-7-2-6-8.
-Driver: white male with brown hair. Copy?
-Copy.
I'm out of this as soon as he clears the gate.
The van has too much profile on it
right now.
Copy that, too. We're up.
-Broken seal?
-Hey, Frank.
What's missing?
Nothing so as we can tell.
Can's full of diapers.
-Diapers?
-Disposables, yeah.
I'm thinking not even your crew
would steal Pampers off the dock, right?
I'm not so sure.
Customs seal probably just broke
on the offload, is all.
When's Bea Russell coming back
from the Fairfield piers?
Who, Beadie? She's not down Fairfield.
Don't you worry, Frank.
Your girl will be back soon enough.
-Yeah?
-She's detailed.
Something to do with city police.
All right, we're up.
I'm out. You have the eyeball.
12-08, copy that.
First I got this thing on my phone bill.
Now I hear Bea Russell's doing some shit
with real police.
You're paranoid, Frank.
-Why would she lie?
-Shit if I know.
-The Greek has two today, right?
-Boris comes back in an hour.
The second can's in a lower bay
ready to offload when I get to it.
Check that can through straight up.
You got it?
Enter it on the computer, like any other.
The next can after it,
make that one disappear.
You want me to lose a clean can?
-And give it to the Russian, yeah.
-You gonna tell them?
If I'm going nuts, I'll calm down tomorrow.
We'll slip the hot can off the pier.
If I'm right about this, they'll thank me.
And, Horse, make sure nobody's living
in that can when you stack it.
I know.
We got something here.
Another disappeared can
just hit the chassis.
They're running them out in tandem.
-That means "one after the other," Jimmy.
-I know what it means.
1 2-08.
Carver, what's the status of your truck?
Left the can at the warehouse
and rolled out.
-You want us on the truck or the can?
-The can.
Copy.
-I got no eyes at the port.
-Kima?
-She pulled up.
-I got it.
But the truck already left. You won't make it.
I'll call the MPA, delay the truck.
Do it. You're still here?
Good call.
License and registration, please.
You were doing 24 mph in a 20 mph zone.
-You stop for 24 mph?
-License and registration.
Christ, I wish we had a tap
on the port office phone.
I just wanted to give you a heads up.
That last little item we sent out, it's wrong.
I knew it was wrong when I let it go.
Not on the phone, Frank.
Okay, but this time he needs to be there.
In fact, he wants to be there
to hear this shit.
Go ahead, open it.
Bobbie Dolls.
What the fuck is this bullshit?
I am waiting for Russian vodka
and you bring me trash from Taiwan.
Give me your phone. Fucking Polacks.
Are they thieves or are they stupid?
He's dialing the same number.
It came, but it's nothing.
It's bullshit.
I was expecting this. Just get rid of it.
Get rid of it where?
Drop it in the fucking street.
-This is sweet.
-The boss man.
And we're on him.
-7 a.m.?
-Man, what the fuck do you think?
We gotta be there, in place,
when they come on.
Shit is early.
Y'all down for this?
'Cause I can find me some motherfuckers
to swing bats for me if I have to.
You didn't say nothing about no bats.
All right.
That's the fuck I'm talking about.
Bring your boys, too. 7:00.
-Hey, Poot.
-Yo, Poot.
Come on, man.
God damn,
you're a pussy-crazed motherfucker.
A nigger can't look at a female?
Yeah, but you be getting dizzy
behind that shit.
-At least I be getting some.
-Well, I be getting some, too.
But I don't make it my everything.
Lieutenant, you still up?
I'm here.
I'm still on this second can,
but it doesn't make sense.
He went to ground
at an appliance store off Eastern.
Now he's dumping it.
10-4. Come home.
-You don't wanna sit on the can?
-Negative. The can is clean.
I don't know, Uncle Frank.
Putting two and two together,
and coming up with six, maybe.
Maybe.
You called Spiros still, right?
Spiros will know what to do.
Come past early tomorrow.
I wanna get down the diner first thing.
All right.
I can't keep up with him.
What's with the duck?
Ziggy.
Is Daniels around?
-No.
-What's the deal with can number two?
No contraband.
Heard them complaining about it
on the wire. Somebody fucked up.
The fact is, they even called the boss man
about it.
That's a good day.
You guys going for a taste?
No, I'm gonna chase the paperwork.
I gotta spring the sitter.
But for a ride home, I'll go for a quick beer.
-But more than one, I get sleepy.
-Yeah, me, too.
-What, you short a car?
-Need new brake pads.
Two. Boys.
How about you?
Boy and a girl.
And your husband, he....
None of my business, I know,
but did he die or something?
You mean 'cause no one would leave
a beauty like me unless he kicked?
I was just asking.
He left me.
Left us.
Picked up, moved south.
Said it was either my job or him.
That I was neglecting my duties
around the house, all that.
Said that he didn't get married
in order to cook his own dinner.
Anyway, he's cooking his own dinner now.
What about with you and your wife?
What happened?
She died.
-Not now, Gus. I'm good.
-Whatever you say, Jimmy.
So, you about ready to go?
-Sure.
-Be right back. I just gotta make a call.
Please enter your code now.
-Hi, may I help you?
-Yeah, let me talk to Eve.
-This is Eve.
-I'm looking to connect.
Would you like a date tonight?
No, not tonight.
I'm back in town in a couple of nights.
-Have you been entertained by us before?
-No, first time for me.
We can arrange whatever you like,
whenever you like.
What kind of a girl are you looking for?
We have a variety for you to choose from
when you arrive.
When are you thinking of coming?
Just give me a minute.
Stop! Move away from the cookiejar.
Long day.
Yeah, me, too.
Thanks for the beer.
Goodbye.
Hey, y'all, they coming.
What these motherfuckers think
they looking at?
Nigger, you've lost
your motherfucking mind.
-You're standing on my real estate.
-Mine now.
-Took it while you was resting.
-Y'all too late.
Look, I'm gonna let you walk off right now,
or we could do it the other way.
Who you got to do it the other way? Them?
-You gonna see me in your sleep.
-Yeah, I know.
That's right. Keep walking, bitch.
They gonna come back.
Yeah. The way we just punked them,
they got to.
-Where is he?
-You can talk to me, Frank.
-This is bigger than you.
-I'll tell him what you say.
Bullshit. Come on, Nick.
That's the Greek? That old guy?
I seen him in here before.
Have a seat.
A long time since we talk, Frank.
-Coffee, something?
-We're good.
What's on your mind?
Every goddamn thing.
For one,
I think my cell phone's being tapped.
All of a sudden, the phone company
don't care if I pay my bills anymore.
Meantime, I hear that our regular port cop,
the one that found your girls...
got pulled off to work some special thing
with the city police.
-So you switched the can.
-I ran a test.
I gave you that clean one,
put yours in the stacks.
Straight away,
the MPA cops stop that Russian's truck...
right after he picked it up.
I think someone's got a line
into our computer.
Very smart.
As soon as you called,
I shut down the warehouse.
That's fine. But now we're going to
have to open the warehouse again.
Lose a few more clean cans,
deliver them there.
If someone's watching,
show them we have nothing to hide.
Our cut stays the same though, right?
You kidding?
What's your name?
-Nick.
-Sobotka.
That's a fair question, Niko.
But it has to be the same for everyone:
no work, no pay.
Doesn't matter what's in the cans.
We still gotta check them through.
-That's work, isn't it?
-We take gas, so do you.
-You don't understand--
-I understand completely.
No one is in this for love.
It ain't just the money.
I got things happening right now.
Things with my union. Right now!
Not a fucking month from now,
when the legislative session is history. Now!
Okay. We pay you still.
I'm thinking of all the business we do
in the future...
and I want you should be happy.
Thanks.
It's a new world, Frank.
You should go out
and spend some of the money...
on something you can touch:
a new car, a new coat.
It's why we get up in the morning, right?
WMD. Got that WMD here.
I'm looking for what you had the other day.
-This shit right here?
-The other day you was calling it bin Laden.
But now it's WMD.
It will mass destruct your ass.
So this the hi-test?
Same shit, new name.
You be all right.
Okay, get dressed.
I pressed you some clothes
and laid them out upstairs.
And don't forget that book bag neither.
You got your chrome, young one?
I'll take mine.
Y'all mind the crossfire, you hear?
Let's go.
They coming up the alley!
They coming back!
Aim for the chest, brother, you hear me?
Slide up.
You get down on that floor and stay there,
you hear?
-You hear me, boy?
-Okay, Mama.
Come on!
Fuck!
Shit!
-Why you running?
-What the fuck?
Oh, shit!
Hit that nigger cold.
Bitches!
Why you hiding?
Drama done with, boy.
You gotta get your bags
and get yourself to school.
Get in, damn it!
T.T., you hear me?
Come on now. The drama's done.
Get your bags and get yourself to school.
I told you, you gotta get ready....
No!
They're changing up?
Looking for my La-Z-Boys.
Five of them you got for me, right?
-That shipment is tomorrow.
-Got it.
That's what the Newkirk warehouse
was giving us a few days back.
Straight, to-the-point drug talk.
No muss, no fuss.
Now listen.
Pyramid, lnc. May I help you?
-You got them Davinas or what?
-I'm told we no longer carry that line, sir.
Between me, Kima, Herc and Carver...
we been sitting on that warehouse
every minute...
since we followed that truck off the docks.
No players coming in or going out.
No drug-related traffic at all.
To top it off,
Sobotka hasn't used his cell phone since.
-We tipped our hand somewhere.
-That second can, maybe.
The port police making a traffic stop
on their cargo must've spooked them.
If that's what did it,
we fucked ourselves over nothing.
They dumped that can as a misdelivery.
-What?
-They probably changed that up, too.
If they think we're onto them...
they switch the can themselves,
just to be safe.
And it goes off the docks
with some bullshit inside...
-just to see if we pull them up.
-Which we did.
Which I did.
No, they're not on us completely.
If they were, they'd be shutting
that warehouse down and rolling out.
Instead, they're just sitting inside that place,
turning away calls...
waiting us out.
I, for one, am a patient motherfucker.
Don't waste film.
I been here so fucking long
that you're starting to look good to me.
Anything?
The drugs go in, they gotta come out, right?
I mean, what the fuck?
Little late.
When a 9-year-old kid hit the pavement...
a district commander would be there
within minutes.
I guess we're living in a brave new world.
I was in Washington with Burrell
when I heard.
D.C.? What for?
Burrell took some district commanders
down to DOJ with him...
pimping ourselves for a little grant money.
So what do we got?
Nine-year-old in his bedroom...
catches a seeing-eye stray
through the window.
-Dead?
-Pronounced at University.
-Witnesses?
-No one offering a name...
but the general theme
is two crews arguing over the real estate.
We got casings from at least
three different calibers on the ground.
We're gonna canvass hard,
but your people and Tactical...
should hit the area drug corners
and collect bodies.
Fucking pointless.
We jack up enough shitbirds,
this case can fall.
I ain't talking about that. I know the drill.
I'm talking about this whole mess.
Been chasing this shit
from one corner to the next like it's a plan.
Hit the corners, Howard. Take scalps.
You'll feel better when you do.
You told us about WorldCom
and the name change-up, right?
-You said that--
-I said change the name of our product.
I didn't say nothing
about taking people off a corner.
We done changed the name
of that weak shit so many times...
that don't nobody come down
to the Towers no more.
And them Carrollton boys had it going on.
Who shot the young one?
I don't know. I don't think it was us.
Them other niggers was going wild, though,
I mean--
You know, the cops are gonna have to
bang some heads on this one.
They got to.
That means we gotta shut everything down
until this shit pass.
That means the Towers, the low-rises.
Everything gotta take
a long fucking time-out!
I know, String.
I'm sorry, man.
Let me tell you something, man.
This here game,
it's more than the rep you carry...
the corner you hold.
You gotta be fierce, I know that.
But more than that,
you gotta show some flex.
Give and take on both sides.
-You hear me?
-Yeah.
All right, anything that fired a bullet
out on that corner...
has gotta disappear, you understand me?
I'm not talking about the storm drains.
Call that nigger Shamrock
and drive all that chrome over to the harbor.
All right.
Coming up.
I got people waiting on a package from me...
but Sergei says
that until we're sure about the police....
We're not going to be doing that business
for a few days.
Your uncle, he is right to be careful.
But, Niko...
if you are going to be doing this,
you should not be talking to us about it.
Why not?
We are more, what you call, wholesalers.
I'm kind of small-time, huh?
You are not so big,
but you're among friends.
Call that number.
-Talk to him.
-Mike?
This White Mike?
-You know him?
-From Curtis Bay.
I went to Southern High School
with the guy.
You are with us now,
so he will be fair. No problem.
Now, for the rest of our business....
We will disappear these containers.
All of them clean.
Take them to Newkirk Street.
If there is a problem,
they will stop the trucks...
or we will see the police.
If not, no more worries.
All right.
We are off the warehouse phone now?
All day yesterday,
I was giving the new number to our people.
This is bullshit.
If they were onto the truck,
then they would've searched it, no?
Five-O!
Where you guys going?
Come on, you know the deal.
Get the fuck up against the wall! Hurry up!
Come on, keep moving.
Get him. Down.
This is bullshit, man.
You know I ain't did nothing, man.
Everybody gets the special
downtown at central booking:
one baloney sandwich and one white milk.
-Just shut the fuck up.
-Man, I'm clean, you hear me?
-What are you doing in the Pit then?
-Saying no to drugs.
Don't just say no to drugs, motherfucker.
Say, "No, thank you."
Put your fucking head down,
step up and get in.
Sit down right here, stupid.
Watch your head going in.
Slide over, asshole.
Shame a kid had to get killed
before we got around to doing this.
What exactly is it that we're doing?
Young boy killed over bullshit.
Now you got the police
crawling all the way up your ass.
It's a good day to be an Eastside nigger,
I gotta say.
Thing is, it ain't gonna happen like that
if I take you up on your offer.
I'll be out there selling that real.
My boys ain't gonna be scuffling.
They ain't gonna be scuffling or standing
on nobody's else's corner, starting no shit.
You're Westside.
You must've heard of Charlie Sollers, right?
No.
Goes all the way back
to Franklin and Fremont.
I mean, all the way back to the '60s and shit.
-Sollers?
-Sold heroin like it was water.
I mean,
the motherfucker made himself some money.
I don't know who the fuck you talking about.
I know you don't.
And the police don't.
And the stick-up boys
wouldn't have a fucking clue either.
'Cause Charlie Sollers just sold dope.
No profile, no street rep.
Just buy for $1, sell for $2.
Sometimes, when your back up
against the wall, you go to the gun.
I know. I been there.
But you ain't gotta live by it.
Avon's a soldier.
That's who you want with you
when the shit fly.
But as far as business go....
-You still got that connect?
-Right off the boat, String.
All right.
I'm gonna buy from you
at the price you paying...
and I'll let you walk that shit
straight in the Towers.
You can have 734, 770 and 221 .
I keep the other three.
How you gonna tell it to Avon?
It makes sense, don't it?
He gonna hear something
when it makes sense.
Right?
No shit.
-I thought you was in with Nicky.
-Fuck Nick.
He said you was his other half.
I don't want his fucking money.
I mean, that's drug money.
And fucking drugs are bad, right?
I mean, you gotta consider
what that shit does to the community.
You spent all last year with White Mike.
You remember that?
A man can grow.
Besides, I got a caper in mind
that is gonna put that horseshit to shame.
I'm telling you.
You want in?
-What do I gotta do?
-What a longshoreman does best, Johnny.
Zig, your duck won't touch
the Pikesville rye?
He drinks mid-shelf.
He don't like that rail shit.
Fuck if I wouldn't give my right leg
for a shot and a beer.
New Charles in the house.
-Moving pretty good.
-Waiting on a prosthetic.
You got a decent lawyer?
Nat Coxson hooked me up
through the union.
What's with the duck?
-You know you gotta let go of your name.
-Say what?
Yeah, New Charles don't work no more
for a one-legged fuck.
Yeah, maybe "Stump."
You know what? "Peg."
"New Peggy."
-How about "Tilt"?
-Tilt?
Tilt. Just like a pinball machine.
Tilt. I like that.
Yeah, I called a couple of nights ago.
Told you I might be in town tonight,
remember?
-So, this is your first time?
-Yep, first time for me.
What do you do, Jimmy?
Are you the police?
-Do you work with the police?
-No. Christ, no.
No, I'm a traveling salesman.
I travel and, you know....
-Where do you live?
-I'm not gonna tell you that.
I live out of town.
I'm sorry.
I don't think we can help you tonight.
Thank you.
You sucked. I mean, really.
Fuck if I thought
I was gonna be interrogated.
I mean, Christ,
I'm just a guy looking to get laid, right?
Hey, fucknuts.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Christ, Ziggy.
Jesus, Zig. What the fuck?
What's up with my cousin?
Don't even talk to me about that asshole.
-Drank himself to death.
-Oh, shit.
What kind of fool
would give a duck whiskey anyhow?
That boy ain't right.
And his fucking bird
couldn't hold liquor for shit.
La-Z-Boys?
And Davinas. Male and female.
Dope and coke.
-What the hell is a Davina?
-It's like a love seat, kind of.
-Any line on weight?
-All whole numbers.
-No halves, quarters, eight-balls?
-Ounces?
What kind of numbers
they putting on the furniture?
Nothing much above five.
Proposition Joe has Ashland
all the way up to North.
Ten corners, easy.
Five ounces wouldn't last him past lunch.
It's kilos. We're on the main stem.
It's kilos. We're on the main stem.
-What was coming and going last night?
-Not much.
No trucks in, some cars in and out...
but none of the drug players
we saw rolling up there before.
Whatever was in that last truckload
probably went out in car trunks.
They're doing their distribution
somewhere else for now.
Which is why job one
is to get back to a good phone.
The same PC
that got you on that warehouse phone...
will get you anywhere else you want to go.
All we need is the new number.
Verizon running
any new lines in there lately?
We talked to the phone security people.
They say no.
Probably going to a cell phone.
Best bet is to get the new number
off the Russian's cell phone.
Okay, then.
Freamon and Prez,
stay on one shift in the wiretap room.
Bunk and Russell, man the other.
Herc and Carver,
you guys are on Newkirk Street...
waiting to see
if the warehouse traffic picks back up.
McNulty and Greggs
have a line into the prostitution ring.
But so far, the people handling the girls...
have been a little cautious
about fresh johns.
So we're gonna need a new angle there.
Questions?
What was your play with those girls?
Out-of-town salesman.
-How far out of town?
-What do you mean?
The farther out of town,
the more they believe.
Less like a cop you sound.
You do any accents?
English, British, Scottish,
something like that?
Crikey!
I was looking to get a little hanky-panky...
and this one bloke gave me this number
to call when I got across the pond.
Work on it, son.
$200,000?
That isn't a quarter of what they owe.
They say they will pay another $200,000
once their shipment clears the docks.
-And then?
-That is all.
These Colombians
are without honor, Spiros.
They are cheats.
-The chemicals we sent are good, no?
-No complaint.
They say they want more, even.
And they understand that we can guarantee
their product gonna clear Customs?
Right.
-And still, they try to chisel.
-Why?
What are they thinking?
That it is all profit for us.
That we will settle
for half of what we agreed...
because $400,000 is still a lot of money.
The Greek will be angry.
This is business, Eton.
The Greek? He will be smart.
Jesus.
You accidentally shoot one 9-year-old
in his bedroom...
and the whole city gets its undies
in a bunch.
To err is human, that's what I like to say.
The mayor went to the scene
for the cameras last night.
Said the crime will not stand.
Tell the mayor we're still working
without an eyeball witness.
How about the street talk?
I got some mentions of a 17-year-old
with the streetname Bodie.
Narcotics has him as Preston Broadus.
And why is young Preston
not being hurled with great abandon...
around one of our interrogation rooms?
We got cars on his grandma's as we speak.
What the fuck you think
you're dealing with here? Amateurs?
Fuck Nick. This is my thing.
You want in, you gotta deal with me.
All right, I got S-Class and SL-Class Benzes.
Roadsters, sedans, cabriolets.
I got them brand new,
with the keys in the ignition.
Nothing stripped.
-Off the docks?
-No shit, off the docks.
What the fuck do I look like,
a fucking car dealer?
Twenty on the dollar.
But if we're gonna do this, I'm gonna
need you to order a minimum of three.
Or else it ain't worth it for me.
Now, base price on an S430
starts at $73,000.
You round it,
I get $15,000 for each car that you want.
A stolen car is a stolen car.
Without title,
who is going to pay even $10,000 for it?
Sure, in Baltimore, maybe.
But where you're from...
I'll bet you got family
that don't give two fucks...
whether or not an American car
got a title on it.
Man, it would be a sad state of affairs...
if an international entrepreneur
such as yourself...
didn't know what to do
with a couple of extra Mercedes.
Big night for Jimmy McNulty.
Or should I say
James Cromwell of Knightsbridge...
Stepney and Mersey.
Excuse me?
Cromwell was the English fuck
who stole my ancestors' land...
and the other ones
are all from rock 'n' roll songs.
Anyways, 10:00 tomorrow night...
the shuttle comes for me
on the parking lot off Russell Street.
Good work.
We'll get Greggs to wire you up
and set the surveillance.
Shame we're not up
on a good phone right now.
Be nice to tickle the wire
when we raid the brothel.
A little luck,
maybe we get back up before then.
One other thing.
I'm bothered that a Russian immigrant
this deep in dirt...
doesn't have anything
in a law enforcement computer.
You still got that friend over in Woodlawn?
I'd like to know what the FBI has
in its database.
After that meeting on the Barksdale case...
I made a point of pissing him off,
remember?
So what? You do that to everybody.
This is George Glekas.
He's the cat who owns the appliance store
where that second can landed.
Run his ass, too.
Why not just cut another guy in
and run them out the bobtail lane?
These babies start disappearing
and everybody on the terminal...
is gonna suspect an inside job.
We're gonna need bolt cutters
for the fence...
and then we're gonna need
enough wood beams...
to make a track across the grass
onto the road.
Why bother?
We can run them cars
over that little patch of grass, no problem.
That ain't the plan.
I just saw a can disappear.
-Talco line?
-Pakusa working it?
-It's him. Do we try to follow?
-We know where it's going, right?
1 2-08, you copy?
1 2-08, what's up?
We got a can that might be coming to you
off the port.
Can number: Paul-Mike-Quebec-Victor...
4-0-0-7-6-5, check digit two.
-What do you want us to do with it?
-See if it arrives.
And if it does?
See what happens then.
You wanna know something, Carv?
I'm starting to think
that as criminal investigators...
we're not really respected.
That ain't necessary, Jimmy.
I knew we were fucking the dog
on that Barksdale thing.
Who do I tell?
We got this new ASAC,
thinks it's all about loyalty and ass-kiss.
And believe me, this ain't like your agency.
You piss them off, you ride the boat.
Here...
you come into work one morning,
you find yourself assigned...
to some fucking dustbowl
lndian res in Arkansas.
-Still, I was out of line, Fitz.
-Fuck it.
What you got there, brother?
White boys. A different look for you.
Funny thing is, they're all showing clean.
What's the chance of that?
Anyways, NCIC and NADDIS are a dead end.
Customs had a little intel
on this guy, Glekas.
You said Customs had intel on him?
Should show here.
Let me try something else with it.
This'll give us any contact your boy
might have had with us, agency-wide.
Got something out of San Diego.
-On Glekas?
-We'll see.
I make a long distance call to Hyattsville...
I need three forms
and a lieutenant's approval.
Yes, Agent Ernest Koutris, please.
Believe me,
we ain't short on paperwork here either.
Agent Koutris?
Not much to it.
We pulled his chain in a stolen goods case
I worked in '95, '96.
He was just crumbs, so no charges.
But I did an interview.
The guy struck me
as just a mope playing it slick.
Yeah, if you want, I can send you what I got.
All right.
If you need it, let me know.
We need to talk.
Anyone following?
Run up and down the street.
Take tag numbers from cars.
-All week I've done it. Nothing.
-Again.
The truck is here.
Lester, it's here.
They offload anything?
Not yet.
Okay, wait on it.
See, the thing about it, Preston,
is that you're unbelievably stupid.
You are.
I don't say it to upset you.
Just to state a fact.
He doesn't think so.
Nobody ever thinks they're stupid.
It's part of the stupidity.
You don't need to tell us
what happened on that corner.
We know what happened.
We got you, we got your guns,
we got the whole fucking story.
Where that lawyer at, man?
See, you just fucked up.
Way you looked at the bag,
you know what's in there, don't you?
That's you, right there, fucking up.
-I don't know what you talking about.
-No, you fucked up.
We even got your prints on one of the guns.
We even got that.
Which one?
That's you right there.
Lawyer.
They were asking about me?
San Diego.
San Diego was a long time ago.
Our friend in Washington
does not know why.
Only that the people asked.
You told me the police
looking into the women were local.
They were.
No FBl.
We've been running only clean containers?
Yes. And no one watches, no one follows.
No one stops anything.
And we changed the warehouse phone?
A day or two more,
and we are back to business.
We watch, we are careful.
But we are back to business.
You will have to do a favor
for our friend, no?
Fair is fair.
The Colombians, I think.
They take our chemicals
and pay less than promised.
Down there,
I understand everyone is a terrorist now.
Judges are killed.
Bombs go off in the street. It's very bad.
The Colombians who cheated us,
they're not with the guerrillas.
They're trash.
The world is a smaller place now.
And the FBI cares very much
about such things.
Fair is fair.
Sergei's making a call.
If there is no problem,
then bring in the La-Z-Boys.
I will meet you there.
Recognize that voice?
That's the man
from the warehouse phone, right?
-That's the same guy?
-Same guy, new number.
-Who you calling?
-Pearlman, at home.
Another affidavit,
and we're back on the main stem.
Shit is raw, String.
I mean, you can stomp on this motherfucker.
All right.
So, when them police stop
busting heads up in them Towers...
you all let Prop Joe's people
take hold of three of them.
All right.
Okay, add the DNR stuff to the boilerplate,
and you're there.
Start connecting the dots...
and you have to start asking yourself
what these guys aren't into.
Drugs, women, stolen goods. All of them.
FBI didn't have much.
A little something out of San Diego
on Glekas...
-in a stolen goods case that was closed out.
-San Diego?
These guys move around.
-What's with the suit?
-Date night.
The undercover at the brothel.
Run like hell, ma'am.
We wanna be up on that phone,
so we hear what we hear after tonight's raid.
Who's the affiant?
Can you get the SL-series in Pacific blue?
That would be best.
Whatever you need, chief.
I don't give a damn
about the color of this one.
Whatever you have.
Ain't a problem.
They all just gotta have sunroofs.
It's a long story.
Next Tuesday would be good for us.
A ship comes Wednesday early, so....
Listen...
you think I can get an advance on this?
I got some expenses right now,
and I'm a little tapped.
-I'm just asking.
-Payment on delivery.
Don't worry about it, chief.
I would never even dream of cheating
a smart businessman like yourself.
It ain't enough that I gotta be the one
thinking this whole shit through.
That I gotta be the one
looking out for this shit and that shit.
Checking up on this,
making sure this shit is done.
No, that's not enough.
That's why they be paying
them fucking CEOs so much damn money.
Because when the shit fall bad,
it all fall bad on them.
Everybody else can be ducking and hiding,
doing what they fucking wanna do.
But when push come to shove...
I'm the one
who's got to take that responsibility...
and y'all are leaving me
very little to work with right now.
-Hold up, String--
-No, that's a very simple thing, my nigger.
You drive the guns to the water.
You look around, you ain't see anybody,
you throw the guns.
In the water.
Splash.
Now, get the fuck out of here, man.
Except you, young one.
You ain't say shit back there?
No, they fucked up when they told me
my prints was on one of them guns, right?
And I wiped them shits down myself.
And the one they said was mine
wasn't even.
If they would've had anything past my name,
they would've kept me, right?
-All right.
-All right, String.
Lock that door.
You got a bolt cutter?
'Cause I'm gonna need a good one.
Got two in the window there.
Got two in the window there.
You hung this on a duck?
Of course.
$1,200.
Fair enough.
-Nick.
-It's been a while, Mikey.
Yeah, it has.
But your name
has been ringing out in my mind lately.
Yeah?
My man called.
Said you was gonna take a re-up from me.
Yeah, that's what they told me, too.
Nicky Sobotka, living the life.
Who fucking knew?
-So how much you looking for?
-Two or three G-packs a week.
I was getting that shit
from the Greek's people.
-Four each.
-Four?
I wholesale for five, man.
I don't know.
They told me
you were gonna be straight with it.
Sergei. What up, dawg?
I got a friend of yours here
says we're giving Gs at four.
Yeah?
All right, fuck it. Yeah, it's fine.
Another thing.
I wanna know it wasn't your people...
dropped that body over on Potee Street
the other night, you know?
I'm asking 'cause it was someone
with some Greek-ass name...
and fuck if he wasn't dumped
in front of a house I was using.
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?
Yes? Then it wasn't us.
Idiot.
You got friends in high places, Nicky.
-Four a pack for you.
-All right, cool.
Thank God for the Russian's cell phone.
They might be laying off the warehouse line,
but at least he ain't changing that up.
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?
Yes? Then it wasn't us.
-What the fuck is that?
-It's a man's purse.
European men like yourself
sometimes carry one.
Them people ain't right over there.
The mike has to go somewhere.
Besides, you might have hands all over you
before we get what we need.
Indeed I might, luv.
It'll be your call
when we come through the doors.
You want us in, you say.... What was it?
"Spot on." It means "exactly."
And remember, they have to bring up
the money and the sex first...
then an overt attempt to engage.
Spot on.
Detective Freamon with Baltimore Homicide.
Listen, what do you guys have
in VICAP for male victims...
headless or faceless,
and missing both hands?
Middle Atlantic region probably.
$4.5 million in the capital budget
that's set to pass House and Senate both.
Money'll be allocated
for the fiscal period next year.
Congratulations, Frank.
What kind of stevedore drinks champagne?
So, Nat, about the election.
I just need one more year
to bring the dredging home.
That's what I need.
Ott's turn, Frank.
This is Agent Koutris
of the FBI down in Washington.
He's with the counterterrorism people
down there.
-Terrorism?
-He needs our help tonight.
1 1-34, what's your 20?
I'm at the overpass on Wicomico.
Copy that.
Okay, we're on here.
Good evening.
Paint pigments.
They ship them in
for the SCL plant down at Fairfield.
It's in there somewhere.
Run it.
Same consistencies on all the barrels.
-Nothing else in there, really.
-Nothing but the pigments.
-Nothing else in there, really.
-Nothing but the pigments.
-What's going on?
-I don't know nothing, Horse.
Swear to God.
Tonight, I'm just a dumb white boy
from Locust Point.
You know,
I'm saying this out of respect, Brie.
I love the man like my brother,
but when it comes to something like this...
he gonna listen to you
more than he listen to me.
You think so?
All I put in his ear about my son
didn't do a damn thing, now, did it?
All them times I told him
that he needed to do more for D'Angelo...
and what happened?
He feel for that.
He feel for you.
I know he didn't see it coming.
-None of us seen it coming.
-I did.
I swear, I saw it.
He ain't listen to me then.
Why the hell you think he gonna listen now?
'Cause we got a weak product...
and we holding on to prime real estate
with no muscle.
I don't got Wee-Bey, Stinkum, Bird.
Now look, I know that your heart is heavy.
I know.
But them wolves is at that door.
As long as them Towers are still standing,
I am, too.
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let
everything we fought for go to shit.
So I'll talk to him.
Mr. Cromwell.
Decisions, decisions.
Would it be wrong to take two?
Attaboy.
We should get upstairs.
Nothing but paint pigments.
Trust me, old friend. It's there.
Son of a bitch!
Okay, then.
Right.
Maybe, we could talk about this first?
Any time you guys want.
The money changed hands, right?
Sounded that way.
-And they talked about sex?
-Definitely.
Any time you guys want.
Hang on.
Oh, God.
Is it soup yet?
Spot something. Spot on it.
Let's go.
-Whoa.
-Why?
We're supposed to take the door
and get in quick.
Calm the fuck down.
It ain't like they gonna flush
a half dozen whores down the toilet.
-Who is it?
-Baltimore police.
-What do you want?
-To lock your ass up.
Hands. Let me see them.
-Two more in the back.
-Come on, ladies.
You're late.
He okay?
He'll live.
...estimated at 1, 125 kilograms
ofprocessed crack cocaine...
is estimated to be in excess of $45 million.
Federal officials have confirmed
to Channel 6 News...
that their investigation is ongoing...
and that while no arrests
have yet been made...
the seizure itself has severely disrupted
the operations of a group...
believed to have ties
to Colombian narco-terrorist--
Now, that, gentlemen, is a case.
God forbid you two should put something
like that on my friend, Frank Sobotka...
I would die happy.
Our case is progressing.
-Great, what can you charge?
-We're not at that point.
We've got wires into a smuggling operation
that we've linked to drugs and women.
Likely, they're the people
who were bringing in the girls...
who turned up dead in that can
two months ago.
Now, we're on one location that we believe
is a transshipment point for narcotics.
And last night, if you check the 24s...
you'll see that we hit a brothel
we also think ties in.
A month or two more
on the taps and DNRs...
and we will be able to identify
the top-end players.
-You hit a brothel?
-Waterfront condo, high-end.
Jesus.
If you find anything that looks
like a list of steady customers, flush it.
I mean, half the names
in the Maryland Manual are probably on it.
Any problems on the raid?
A complication or two.
Nothing we can't write around.
Immigration is holding the girls.
And the madam, who has legal residency,
we cut loose after she posted bail.
You try to interview them?
See if any will roll?
Not while the taps are up.
Better to let them think it was a random raid
and see what's said on the wire today.
Better to let them think it was a random raid
and see what's said on the wire today.
Cut to the chase.
You any closer on my murders?
If these are the people
who were importing those girls...
then, yeah, we're closer.
The more we learn, the more chance
we have to clear those cases.
What about Frank Sobotka?
I'm not hearing his name in here anywhere.
The union may be involved
in the smuggling...
but we're not getting a sense
that it goes past that.
This is about Frank Sobotka.
The case is bigger now.
Look, missy, this is my detail. I started it.
Now, I'm asking,
do you have charges on Frank Sobotka?
Charging Sobotka at this point
would lose us the wire...
and a chance at the real targets.
-He is the real target.
-Patience, Stan.
-I'm sure if they bring the case--
-You owe me on this, Erv.
You asked for a detail, I gave you a detail.
You asked for Daniels, I gave you Daniels.
Okay.
Now the votes are in...
and you're moving your damn golf trophies
upstairs to the commissioner's office...
now you're freezing me out, huh?
Fucking rat fuckers, all of you.
This is my case.
Mine!
And now you're gonna tell me
who the target is?
Not fucking likely.
He's saying no.
He's saying we fought for
every one of them Towers...
and to give them up now
would mark us as weak.
He's saying if we do this,
Prop Joe would have it over us...
and we might never get out from under.
-We don't have the product or the muscle.
-I told him.
I did.
He say he still trying to find us
a better connect.
And for muscle...
he's saying he sending us
the best he can find.
Brother Mouzone.
He sending in Brother?
From New York.
Coming down to work on retainer,
for as long as we need.
-Brother Mouzone?
-Yep.
"At which point
the officer was unable to resist...
"the ministrations
of the aforementioned suspect...
"and found himself
brought to the point of a sexual act."
You're famous behind this, you know that?
As a pervert,
this report is gonna make you a BPD legend.
I can't perjure myself.
I gotta explain it somehow.
Motherfucker, you have violated
a half dozen departmental regs right there.
Not to mention that no state's attorney
is gonna even bring this thing into court.
We're not going to court.
The girls are being deported.
We did the raid
just to tickle the wire, remember?
There were two of them. I was outnumbered.
You fucking with me, right?
Brother Mouzone, from NYC?
I went to Avon, told him I didn't have
enough muscle to hold down them Towers.
-Played it like that.
-Yeah, and he reached out.
Joe, I'm still holding on to this deal.
Know what I'm saying?
This is just some shit we gotta deal with.
Deal with how?
My nigger, I would take
the motherfucker out if I could...
but Avon can't know
it came from his own people, right?
You don't think I'm gonna send
any of my people up against Brother?
Shit.
That nigger got more bodies on him
than a Chinese cemetery.
True.
Look, I'm just saying,
this your problem, not mine.
You want my product,
you need to deal with it.
All right, so listen, we got some time here.
Avon gotta send up word
and wait for word to come back...
set up a price, talk to Brother Mouzone,
I mean, set up the whole shit.
And that's like a week or maybe two.
And by that time,
your people's gonna be in the Towers...
and if the money's right,
then that is what it is.
Ain't no nigger from New York
gonna change the facts from the ground.
All right?
1 2-08 to 1 1-37, you there?
1 1-37, what you got?
That last truck is on the move.
It sits there for two days
and they don't offload a thing.
-10-4.
-They're testing us.
They been moving clean cans.
-The trash hasn't drawn any flies.
-No?
-Wejust took out the last of it. No problems.
-Okay, then we go.
-What about llona?
-She is home. They kept the children.
There are always more children.
Why don't we tap that cell phone,
even if we don't know who we're tapping?
That call might just be our PC.
And this here is the little king of everything.
So how many we got in the sector?
Double shift, plus the Flex Squad, DEU...
and a dozen guys Tactical sent us.
We're on every corner.
Pretty damn quiet today.
Today.
Let's go.
Officer.
Fucking-A.
Yeah, shit is good.
Here. Next time we re-up, though...
tell Moe man we need about 700,
800 more of them dimes, all right?
I ain't even seen shit like this
since I don't know when.
-Same with the jumbos?
-Yeah, better get more of those, too.
What the fuck is up now?
String, what's up, man?
What up? Can't call it.
-How's our package?
-How's it look? Shit is good.
See these Eastside motherfuckers
over here?
I want you to extend
to these motherfuckers...
all the hospitality that
West Baltimore is famous for.
-You heard?
-You want us to fuck them up?
No, dawg.
We're giving them 221, 734, and Saratoga.
We keep the rest. If anybody start any shit...
they'll have to answer to me,
all right? Directly.
You heard me, right?
All right.
What are these off-brand niggers gonna do
with a project tower?
Fall back, young 'un.
We're gonna show y'all motherfuckers
how to grind out here, all right?
Hey, String.
I heard you, man, I did.
But this shit right here,
it don't make no sense.
You like the new product we selling?
It make sense now?
-Where are we at with our Boss Man?
-We should be up on his phone soon.
-The PC is there, no question.
-We get up on his cell phone, he's done.
We'll ID him, no problem.
I don't know. They came down on that
warehouse phone when we spooked them.
Sobotka's cell phone, too.
We might be going up on a dead line.
This is the other way to go.
Compared to the wiretap,
it's the longer way around.
But still, if he's changing up
on his cell phone....
Over the last week or so...
we've not only confirmed the identities
of some of the key players...
we've also got GPS trackers
on all their cars.
First of all...
Eton Ben-Eleazer.
He's the drug Lieutenant in the warehouse.
-E-ton.
-Whatever.
Our madam, Miss llona Petrovna.
George Glekas, who runs
the appliance store over in Highlandtown...
and the probable fence for the organization.
We followed some of them in real time.
With this little toy here,
there's something else we can do.
That's seven days
of where our targets have been, sped up.
And lookit. Two locations only...
where three or four cars stopped
at the same time for more than five minutes.
One "X" is a dive of a diner
down on South Clinton.
The other is on the western shore
of Fort Howard down past Edgemere.
We get up on these locations,
maybe we get a photo of the Boss Man.
-Or a tag number.
-It's totally cool.
-Where did you even get this stuff?
-DEA for the trackers.
McNulty pulled the software
from his pals at the FBI field office.
We can pull Herc and Carver
off the warehouse and give them the diner.
McNulty, Bunk, you guys take Fort Howard.
What the fuck, Frank?
You might as well
start posting them things, right?
I mean, shit, if you're gonna run,
you might as well come out and say so.
It ain't personal, Ott.
I want to finish what I started
with the dredging issue.
And you don't think I'm good enough
to handle it.
It ain't about that, kiddo.
Ott, listen to me!
What the fuck do you want me to do?
Tell him where the money comes from?
I.B.S.?
Not to brag, but union racketeering
is one thing the Bureau does well.
That is exactly what I wanted to hear.
This case needs closure, boys.
And in my heart of hearts...
I know you're the kind of bastards
to put Sobotka where he needs to be.
One other thing
you Federals can help me with.
And if you don't mind,
a little discretion is called for.
That, right there,
is the district surveillance van...
which was fully equipped
when it disappeared.
A surveillance van?
Sobotka stole it.
Now it's l-don't-know-where.
The last picture was from Seattle...
but I got prints...
from two other places, see?
You reported the van stolen, right?
It was my feeling that the theft
of a vehicle from a departmental lot...
would reflect poorly on the department.
The thing is, I know you boys
have got enough reach...
to maybe get the van back
without no big dustup.
As a favor for me
having brought you the whole case.
Motherfucking Eastside
need to get their asses...
back across town where they belong.
Yo, man, we run them off,
we run off the good dope so....
I'm just saying
they all the time hustling around...
cutting prices and doing shit. It ain't right.
Walk, nigger.
Yo, what's up, soldier?
-Looking maybe to do something here.
-With him? This motherfucker?
-Looking maybe to do something here.
-With him? This motherfucker?
I saw him over on Ashland last week
selling burns.
-Fuck y'all, nigger.
-Look, what did he say?
$25, two dimes and a coke kicker.
I'll give you two dimes for $15,
plus the ice on top for free. What?
That'll work.
Take it in the lobby. I'll be right behind you.
That's what's up, see?
The game now is that we gotta sell
more of this good shit than they do.
What? Get the fuck out of here!
You mean to tell me
there's a Westside nigger...
who knows how to sell shit
without sticking a pistol in a fiend's face?
Yeah, dawg. And you better get used to it...
'cause y'all ain't selling shit
until we bone-ass dry.
-Believe that.
-All right, nigger. Whatever, man.
All right, cottage-cheese,
chest-ass motherfucker.
-Where do you want it?
-There's good.
Easy.
-We could help you set it up.
-You have a surveillance to cover?
-I got that feeling again.
-Like they don't think we're potty trained.
-Can I help you?
-FBl. Lt. Daniels?
He's in his office.
Without that billboard in my face,
I wouldn't have known.
How could you have known?
-There was the wingtips.
-And the beady eyes. Definite giveaway.
-Tight asses.
-Definitely.
Lt. Daniels? Agents Settles and Mason.
Maj. Valchek said you'd be expecting us.
You listening to this fool?
Saying that the Eastside
is wilder than Westside...
'cause of some shit
about Eastside folks drinking port wine...
while the Westside do sherry?
Port make a man do crazy shit,
I'm telling you.
-Butchie, talk to this fool.
-For me, leastways...
the difference between East and West
goes back to one man:
-Frank Matthews.
-Pee Wee Matthews?
Yeah, the brother went up New York
and got in bed with them ltalians.
The only one from this town
got a piece of that French Connection.
What the hell Pee Wee
got to do with anything?
'Cause Frank was Westside. How do you
like that? The dope flowed West.
When you got a steady supply,
you run shit like a business.
Somebody gets hurt, there's a reason.
Not like this foolishness we got today.
Excuse me.
What say, Omar?
Ain't no thing.
You know I got something for you, right?
Wouldn't come around unless I did.
What up, Butch?
How you holding up, baby?
Except for fretting on you, I'm good.
It's for my people.
A little something for a rainy day.
You built up a right nice-size nest
these past couple of years.
Might be time you maybe think
about backing off some?
Back off to what?
Later, Butch.
Stay, boy.
Damn, Zig, I ain't got it cut yet.
And turn that shit down, for Christ's sake.
Nicely done.
Like I always say,
it pays to go with a union card every time.
-Turn the fucking radio down, Zig.
-Will you get in the goddamn car already?
For Christ's sake,
we ain't got all night. Jesus!
You could drive a tank through there,
it wouldn't take a scratch.
Where the fuck you going with this?
Greece. Athens, Greece.
The hole is so they don't think
it's an inside job.
So they don't look at the union.
Welcome aboard, chief.
Is that you?
I thought you were gonna go shopping.
-Me?
-Yeah.
We round-the-clock with surveillance.
When do we get to the part
where you do all kind of shit for me?
When do we get to that part?
So you past the point
of lifting a grocery bag or two?
You try being me like this.
Something wrong?
The baby's kicking. Wanna feel?
-Almost $4,000.
-I know it is.
The Greek guy, the one with the warehouse,
pays me in cash.
Keeps it off the books,
so he don't have to pay taxes and benefits.
-And you saved all that?
-He gave me a bump, too.
I'm pulling down $700 a week.
You don't believe me?
Christ.
I was saving that up to give to you
for the new apartment.
You know what I'm saying, dawg?
But I don't understand how these hoes
be acting sometimes and shit.
If I tell a bitch, I'm like,
"Bitch, either you suck dick or you don't."
-Gentlemen.
-What's up, my brother?
Are you slinging bean pies up in here?
You know what I mean?
You with the nation, homey?
'Cause either you're a Muslim...
or your momma need to stop
laying your clothes out in the morning.
I'm here to represent the interests
of a Mr. Barksdale.
-Are you familiar with Mr. Barksdale?
-That name ring out, but so do mine.
And you are?
Cheese, man.
Mr. Cheese. I see.
-And who do you work for, Mr. Cheese?
-Who do I work for?
Am I correct in assuming that
you are not employed by Mr. Barksdale?
Hell, yeah.
If that is the case,
then I have to insist that you leave.
-This nigger serious?
-Let me be emphatic.
You need to take your black ass
across Charles Street to where it belong.
-What?
-Hold on now.
He don't know what this is. It ain't
what he think, you know what I'm saying?
First of all, we got permission
to grind in these here towers.
Second of all, I don't give a fuck....
Get off me, get off!
Pellets in plastic. Rat shot.
What you need to be concerned about
is what's seated in the chamber now:
a copper-jacketed, hollow point...
1 20-grain hot street load
of my own creation.
So you need to think for just a moment
and ask yourself:
What do I have to do
before this man raise up his gun again?
Let's go.
Good day to you, sir.
I'm in agreement
with the agents' assessment.
As far as I can see...
this case is an ideal candidate
for RICO prosecution.
My agency agrees RICO is the way to go,
so we'll be in your courthouse, not mine.
But I want one thing on record.
As of 9l1 1,
the Bureau has one priority in this case:
it's waterfront corruption.
It's a new world
and the ports are vulnerable.
This case is bigger than the union.
We're agreeing to take on
the whole case, Lieutenant.
But the union is why
we're in the room with you.
If you're okay with that,
we can work the case together.
We'll copy all the Bureau's 302s
to the Lieutenant and Miss Pearlman.
Your paperwork should CC Squad 6
and my office, as well.
I'll start pumping your casework
into our system.
See what leads that might generate.
Oughtn't you be laid up resting?
A gunshot ain't nothing to trifle with.
Shoulder do hurt.
But this here work just fine.
Tell Stack to polish it up good
and put $7.50 on it.
Shame to let a good toaster get away
over a frayed cord.
First off, ain't nobody running
up in them projects.
Them Westside boys are hurting over this
more than even you.
Trust me,
soon as our good shit run out, they fucked.
Second, a whole passel of hard-ass hitters...
took a go at Brother Mouzone,
and ain't lived to say shit about it.
We go at the boy,
no telling what might get stirred up.
If Stringer takes a shot,
he crosses Avon on it.
Put a bounty on him.
Let some bushwacking fiend
back-shoot his ass.
I pin money on him,
and first thing he come at me?
Shit. Might as well just shoot myself now
and get it over.
There is one boy
who might could just pull this off.
Only, he won't take contract money.
Aim for center mass.
Make sure the man goes down.
No problem.
I got the three on the left.
Fuck you, assholes.
-How you doing?
-How you doing, buddy?
The Samsung S221 . You got that?
I don't see it.
Doing the old inventory, are we?
I hope there ain't been no thieving going on.
Not like the problem we got
down at the docks.
-You get the cars off?
-Sailed two hours ago on the Caspia.
Listed as scrap aluminum.
I got the bill of lading right here.
Not here.
In my office.
Forgive me, but how am I to know...
you did not ship them empty?
I just don't know. Let me see.
Maybe if I had a 4.0 Megapix,
three time optical, fully digitalized camera...
I could've taken some quality photos
of them Benzes in those cans.
But oops. I forgot my camera got busted.
Or you know what I could do?
I could get old Boris
to skulk around them docks...
keep the old commie red eye
on them containers.
Make sure the dock boys
are playing me straight.
-They are what I order?
-Yes.
I got you the S series
in the colors that you wanted.
I even got one parked outside.
You wanna see?
Outside? Now?
I'm just taking her out for a spin, chief.
I'll put her back tonight.
Wait one.
Them cars list out
at better than $60,000 each.
20% was last week. Today, the quote is 10%.
Still, it's good money for a few hours' work.
No!
No fucking way!
We had a deal, motherfucker. A deal.
You listen to me.
It was my fucking ass out there
on the line. Mine.
This piddling shit
is the best that you come up with?
You don't play me like that. You don't.
Fuck you, you thieving, Greek cunt.
Malaka!
You don't know that one, chief.
But you know "malaka, " yes?
Now you know malaka with dress.
Please.
Malaka.
Can you hear me?
Ifyou can talk, please stay on the line.
Get in the boat first,
then put the preserver on.
-It's easier that way.
-Yeah?
Y'all trying to drown my ass for sure.
-Come on.
-Don't push me, man.
Rod.
Got it.
Here. Hold on to that.
I know this one.
Stringer Bell will come at me with this.
Says he's got something with Omar
he need to make straight.
Didn't say what that might be?
Wouldn't tell me.
And to be truthful, I didn't want to know.
No. It don't feel right.
You know them Barksdale people
ain't to be trusted.
No denying all you say is true.
But Stringer talking parley.
So your boy needs to think
long and hard on this.
'Cause if Omar is living his day-to-day
in the street...
there ain't no telling what their next step
might be if there ain't no sit-down.
-"Parley"?
-That's all he says he's looking for.
I'll talk to him.
But if it feels funny to him
the way it does to me...
I got a better chance
of putting a leash to the wind, you know?
If you think it might help,
I can go protection.
-They're the one got hurt the last time.
-Then there was a reason to meet.
-This time feel different.
-I hear you.
Maybe Stringer's still trying
to settle that beef...
behind the fact
that he got to live in this city, too...
Omar being Omar.
If it ain't putting you out none...
I'd feel a powerful lot better
if my nephew took over protection.
Hayward.
Typed and ready for your John Hancock.
-Thanks.
-Sure.
You just have to initial each page
and then sign at the end.
I'm just checking.
This is the official record, right, chief?
It's what's gonna play in court.
Can I change something?
Yeah.
Just put your initials next to your changes.
It's no problem.
Yeah, it's only one.
-You know, you typed "said" here, see?
-"Said"?
He wasn't saying, "Please don't shoot me."
It was more begging.
You know? Double G, he's begging me.
But that's not gonna mess you up,
though, right?
No, it's more descriptive like that.
It's good. Thanks.
Quiet. No one in or out of there.
It's kind of nice out here.
Moonlight on the water.
Waves lapping gently against the boat.
I'm working my regular eight.
I can handle it, you know?
But a detail like this....
That's what I'm asking.
If something comes up on the job,
how would you handle it?
I mean, at home with the kids.
Until now, not much came up.
But now, say something comes up.
I mean, say we do a raid or something.
What would you do?
I guess I'd try to get the sitter to stay.
Maybe call my folks, like I did tonight.
You know how it is with kids.
You gotta be there.
But you wouldn't miss it?
I mean, with everybody rolling out
and you having to head home?
If it keeps going like this,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
-Thanks.
-It's no problem.
You wanna make a phone call to someone?
If you get over to Madison,
it might be some time before you can.
Ain't a chance I get a bail, right?
How about family?
All right, to bring you up to speed,
we've got agents in Le Havre...
shagging leads from the manifest
of the Talco ship due here in a few days.
To see if we can't pinpoint the origin
for the illegal containers.
That's a lot of cans.
A hundred and ten, actually.
How many agents you need to track back
to where all those cans came from?
As many as it takes.
We may be assholes, but on the upside,
there's an awful lot of us.
Let me get this into the computer
for the boys overseas.
Anything from that shithole of a diner?
Herc and Carver had nothing overnight.
The feds took over this morning
and it's still quiet.
I'm going back on the water.
One meet and we're on this guy.
The Talco line's in Wednesday.
I'll send Nick for a number.
-The Greeks again?
-Who else?
They sure do stir up the shit,
them Greeks do.
-Uncle Frank.
-Nicky boy, just in time.
-Uncle Frank.
-What? What happened?
-What the fuck is it this time?
-He shot....
They're saying he shot two of the Greeks.
-Last night, they're saying.
-Shot?
-He shot?
-Fucking Christ!
He's locked up.
He's fucking charged with murder.
-The Greeks?
-Double G.
And one of the kids that works
down the store on the avenue with him.
They're saying he walked in there.
-He went in.
-Why was he there?
-Where the fuck were you?
-Uncle Frank, I didn't know.
What didn't you know?
-What is Ziggy doing near the Greeks?
-I don't know.
You don't know? You're supposed to.
You're his fucking cousin!
You don't know? You're supposed to.
You're his fucking cousin!
You're his father.
1,1 25 kilograms.
Not that drug enforcement's my cup of tea...
but I'm told
it was the largest crack seizure on record.
I just wish I had good news for you.
You told me this was a local effort.
It's sprawled. Now the Bureau's involved.
We're looking hard at the port unions.
My hands are tied.
They're on you with wiretaps.
Several phones, several addresses.
Stefanos.
Have the boy go to Eton.
Tell him to come right away
to the other place.
-You're not calling?
-No phones. No more phones.
Adieu, my friend.
They forgot your fries.
No, they forgot your fries.
-My fries are right in here.
-Those are my fries.
Bitch, everything I say, you hear backwards.
The fries are mine, boy.
Go ahead.
Eat the fries, you fat fuck.
See if I fucking care.
What? You think I'm fat?
There's our boy.
-Lester, Eton's on the move.
-We got it.
-No need for an eyeball follow, right?
-No need.
A fine fucking kettle of fish.
I heard it,
but I had to come see it for myself.
-And sure enough....
-Major?
You know,
I put my faith in you fucking feds.
You let me down.
-Major, we can talk in my office.
-Lieutenant.
It's Lieutenant, right?
I gave you a simple assignment:
that fellow, the one in the corner.
And to make it happen, I gave you all this.
Good digs, people...
everything you needed.
And what did you give me?
Right up the fucking ass, Lieutenant.
-Major, you're going to get--
-Roland, get your shit.
You want to do it your way, fine.
But you ain't gonna use my people
to fuck me.
-Get your gear. I'm pulling you.
-I got.... There's work....
-You said--
-Get your narrow ass back to the district...
before I slap you with insubordination.
Move, shitbird!
Jesus!
Detective, my office.
Base to 1 1-34.
Target number two is coming at your 20.
Copy that. We're on it good.
We're on the Boss.
My God.
-He shoots both?
-He kills George, right there in the store.
-Leaves the boy to bleed.
-For what?
An argument over a few cars?
-That little Polack?
-He's crazy, that one.
The police have him now.
The police still there?
Go to the store.
Whatever the police did not take,
papers, pictures, everything...
you clean it up.
The warehouse, too.
Everything gets clean now.
Everything.
And the phones are dead.
Did you see that?
They just threw the phones.
1 1-34 to Surveillance.
-Standing by.
-We got our man.
Target number one
is a white male, 40s, short...
wearing a tan shirt and a gray tam.
Copy your description.
1 1-34 to Surveillance,
both targets are on the move.
We can't make the vehicle from here,
but you sure can.
Copy.
What was he doing
with that thing in his hand?
Same thing you always do.
Probably sending a text message.
My kids are crazy over that.
That's our guy, right?
What's his face Sobotka
from the drug corner?
I need to get with Vondas.
Who's that?
Spiros. Where is he?
I don't know no Spiros.
-No shit.
-He just up and clocked him?
-Daniels had everybody write what they saw.
-Even us suits.
That was smart. Daniels is sharp.
-Where's Prez now?
-Daniels took him home.
-I don't think he'll come back to this detail.
-You never know.
He might have one of those psychological
bullshit things in his jacket...
gives him immunity or something.
Valchek gave him immunity,
and he just put Valchek on his ass.
-Nothing since the Fort Howard meet.
-They're definitely dumping phones.
When you use a cell phone and
press "send," where does the call go to?
-Why are you asking?
-The Boss Man at Fort Howard.
He tosses the cell phone we're up on, right?
Then he pulls out another thingamajig,
and he types a message.
Text messaging.
It starts at one of those towers
they got up all over the place, right?
And ends up in a computer
at a wireless provider.
If you knew when the call was made,
could you trace the call back to that tower?
'Cause if you could,
mightn't you get a phone number?
You get that,
then you got the billing details, right?
Fool, do you have any idea
how many people use cell phones?
There must be thousands,
hundreds of thousands at any time.
What you need is another variable.
Another bit of data that's gonna help you
isolate your call from all the others.
What if you knew where the call was made?
I mean, exactly where it was made.
We were out in the middle of nowhere.
Does that help narrow it down?
The Fort Howard sea wall. It ain't exactly
Charles and Baltimore Streets.
You've got another problem.
Which wireless company?
There must be Verizon, MCl, AT&T, Sprint....
Shit, tin cans and a string.
You got dozens of them.
Lamar?
-Where's my Harper's?
-Say what?
Harper's. The new issue.
You didn't say that one.
You said The New Republic and Atlantic...
-and a new something else.
-I did not forget to tell you Harper's.
Every week I tell you the same shit,
and every week you forget half of what I say.
Tomorrow, first thing, you go
to the newsstand and you get Harper's.
And The Nation, too,
which you also managed to forget.
You know what the most dangerous thing
in America is, right?
A nigger with a library card.
All damn day, he just sit there reading.
And damned if them Eastside bitches
don't stay away.
-That's real muscle, right there.
-True that.
What are we gonna do
when we start running out of good product?
That's what we need to ask ourselves.
Yo, Bodie,
if Stringer want the Eastside up in here...
then why Barksdale got a man
running them off?
This is getting us nowhere.
We got nothing under Pyramid lnc...
or any of the targets
at any other cellular company.
It's on McNulty then.
11-35, you got the 20?
-I'm on the spot right now.
-Go.
10-4. Latitude first:
North, 39 degrees. 1 1 .727.
Longitude: West, 76 degrees. 26.628.
Now, this was a neat trick.
No one ever did it before.
Identified a cell phone using time and GPS.
We got everything on the phone
that was text messaging...
from those coordinates at 04:45 p.m. today.
Just a subpoena?
With this, you can get account information
and a phone number.
With a search warrant...
you can get two months of text messages.
You got two months of text messages
in this file?
I do, if you've got a warrant.
Tell you what, friend.
We're gonna go back and
start typing that warrant tomorrow morning.
But right now,
we wouldn't mind taking a peek...
at what my man's been up to
in the last 24 hours.
Exigent circumstances.
Thanks, brother.
Fuck me.
Nothing's easy.
-What's up?
-They've dumped their phones.
We're trying to get onto
the Boss Man's text messaging.
They sent that Greek mess over as email.
After he inputs,
the computer will translate it.
Got it.
Shit.
Hey, Prissy.
Thought you'd be here.
Fucking Ziggy.
When didn't he do dumb shit?
Remember when he forged
that Age of Majority card?
We all pooled our money.
You drove us over Brooklyn Park
to the cut-rate.
My mom's puke-yellow Chevy.
We told him specifically:
two bottles of Pikesville Rye and....
Southern Comfort for me.
What did fucknuts get?
Fucking Boone's Farm.
He said that's what the college kids drank.
But we did it up. Right here.
He stood up there, a bottle in each hand...
screaming loud enough to wake the nuns.
What the fuck did he say?
"College kids ain't shit!"
Goddamn, Zig.
-Yeah?
-Beadie, it's Kima.
We're gonna take the Boss out.
-Raids? Tonight?
-You got somewhere to drop the kids off?
No, no problem.
I can take them over to my parents'.
All right, we'll see you soon.
Kima, thanks for the call. Bye.
The judge wants to know how much longer.
We're close.
Dump this row. Dump the computer.
Dump this.
Wake up, Baltimore. It's 6:00 a.m....
Police!
Ready?
Freeze, FBl!
-All clear.
-Check upstairs.
Turn around.
Put your hands up. Behind your neck.
Keep them there.
No, nothing here. All clear.
All clear.
You won't find a goddamn thing!
I can tell you that right now.
Ain't got shit on me.
Fuck! You ain't got nothing.
I'm telling you. Nothing!
Move, shitbird.
FBl, show me your hands!
Get down, fuck! Get down!
Nice.
Bingo.
-From behind your clothes washer.
-That's heroin, 300 gelcaps.
And on today's Chip Franklin Show
at noon...
Chip will be live at Arundel Mills Mall
asking local retailers:
"What do you get
for the guy who has everything?"
Now here's Steve Stewart with sports.
The Orioles continue to....
-We could take him now.
-Not enough profile.
Fucking feds.
Be advised, target 27 is on the move.
I don't get it.
Why leave Vondopoulos out on the street?
The text message that told him to clean up,
it came from someone higher up.
Someone we don't know.
We leave him on the street
after these raids...
he'll probably make contact
with whoever's above him.
Either another text message or a meet.
What's with George Glekas?
I'm afraid he's gonna duck this warrant.
-Chester Karol Sobotka?
-It's Frank Sobotka's kid.
Frank's kid kills one of our targets?
Are you shitting me?
Why? What for?
We hit the store this morning.
Every shred of paper's gone.
Just a bloodstain on the floor.
So we go over to his house a half hour later
with the warrant...
and it's full up with red-eyed Greek relations
looking at us like we're braindeads.
Homicide, Shea.
-This is Daniels, out at Southeast.
-Yes, sir.
Who caught the Highlandtown murder
the night before last?
Jay Landsman, sir.
I'll be right over.
Go get the interviews started.
-Lieutenant?
-Hey, Lt.
What the fuck is that about?
How did we do this morning?
Eton and Sergei are in. So is the madam.
Glekas, I'm not sure.
-The feds are waiting on Sobotka.
-What are they waiting for?
You don't wanna know.
Jesus, Larry....
Jesus, Larry....
The thing is, I think we gotta reach out
to a criminal lawyer real quick.
If the union guys can't handle this mess...
he's gonna have a bail hearing tomorrow.
-Do you have any details?
-I don't know nothing...
except he's locked up for it.
I can't see him till 10:00.
-That's the only time?
-Visiting hours, yeah.
Look, everything's gonna be fine.
-FBl! All of you move, now!
-What the fuck is this?
-FBl, move!
-Against the wall.
He's here.
Got another problem here, Larry.
Big man on the docks.
You don't look so big now, do you?
Ma.
Pop.
It's gone.
And the money, too.
They say you need to come in.
They said the warrant
is at Southeastern police district.
They're out there now.
Showtime, Franky.
-Frank.
-Sir, any comment?
Is it just you, or is it the whole union?
What's your comment
on the charges being brought against you?
Sir, do you have anything at all to say?
Any comment at all?
How will you answer
the charges against you?
Let me ask you, who exactly am I working
all these dead girls for?
The Homicide unit, right?
The same Homicide unit that can't put
two and two together and pick up a phone...
Ieaving me to read it a day-and-a-half later
in The Baltimore Sun.
-What did you take from the scene?
-Photos, latents, spent casings.
Fuck.
They cleaned everything else?
Even for a supremely
fucked-up police department...
this takes the prize.
How'd the kid play it?
He signed a full statement.
He said that there was an argument
about a stolen car or two.
Think he'll open up and talk more?
He's been processed and assigned a PD.
If you want to take a run at the kid,
you're gonna have to get around his lawyer.
I'm sorry, Lieutenant. It's my bad.
State your name, asshole.
What's your name?
What's your name?
State your name.
Come on, you know this part.
Give us a name.
There is your name.
State your name.
No name?
-For now, we'll just call you Boris.
-Boris.
Why always "Boris"?
Racketeering. Wire fraud.
Conspiracy to import heroin.
Conspiracy to violate
federal customs statutes.
White slavery.
Today we're only charging
the customs violations, Mr. Sobotka.
But eventually, a grand jury indictment
will expose you to a lot more.
But eventually, a grand jury indictment
will expose you to a lot more.
Name names, and come clean.
You help yourself and your union.
Help my union?
For 25 years,
we've been dying slow down there.
Dry docks rusting, piers standing empty.
My friends and their kids,
like we got the cancer.
No lifeline got thrown all that time.
Nothing from nobody.
And now you wanna help us?
Help me?
-What's your full name?
-Michael McArdle.
-White Mike.
-Yeah, that's right.
Listen to this, Mikey.
I wanna know it wasn't your people...
dropped that body on Potee Street
the other night.
I'm asking 'cause it was someone
with a Greek-ass name...
and fuck if he wasn't dumped
in front of a house I was using.
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?
Yes? Then it wasn't us.
We hit your suppliers.
They cleaned up
and left you holding the dirt.
-Suppliers of what?
-You discussed a drug buy on this tape.
We also have photographs
tying you to your stash house...
and putting you at The Greek's warehouse
over on Newkirk Street for re-ups.
Do yourself a solid here, Mike.
-What's the plan?
-This is just a detention hearing, Frank.
You're not a flight risk,
you have no meaningful priors.
And so far they've only hit you
with one count.
The magistrate's gonna ask us
some basic questions.
Barring anything unforeseen,
you're out in an hour.
-I said nothing to them suits.
-All the better.
-This Eton, he's in charge of what exactly?
-The dope.
He's what, Greek?
He's a Jew.
You know, from that Jew country they got.
-And what about the guy they call Sergei?
-Sergei's straight muscle.
-Look, I need something to eat.
-Okay, what do you want?
Two hot dogs and a strawberry soda.
I'd fuck the order up.
It's gotta be strawberry?
Hook a brother up.
Big man, that ain't gonna work for Omar.
It's all right.
Been what, a year?
Boy, you don't know,
I been dreaming of running into you again.
You got a focus. I give you that.
Man be like that when he got work to do.
You know what I mean?
I think you've done enough.
Bird gone.
Wee-Bey copped out to all them murders.
He in jail now forever and a day.
Stinkum? I mean, you closed the book
on that nigger your damn self.
Avon, he out of pocket for the time being.
Leaving you.
-You looking for closure?
-Lookit, man, ain't no closure.
Not unless Brandon walk up out his grave
and come up in this room right now.
See, all I know is whoever did him that way,
they gets got.
Whoever did him that way,
they still out there right now.
So now you gonna play like
you had nothing to do with it.
No, I can't lie.
I put the motherfucking paper out on y'all.
But y'all was fucking with my stash.
Anything after that, part of the game.
Maybe. But see,
I went past that with Brandon.
That wasn't me. That wasn't Avon, either.
Bird and them were there to see it.
But another man did all the extras:
all that cigarette shit...
all that bullshit with the eyes.
See now, this man,
he building a rep for himself...
and he wants you bad.
The brutal shit, that's his calling card.
Little bow-tie wearing motherfucker
from out of....
NYC?
Yeah, small dude.
What he go by?
Brother Mouzone.
I know you heard of him, right?
So if y'all got the mind to go after him...
I might be able to point you
in that direction.
Why?
What happened to your boy was business.
But how that shit happened,
you got the right to take that to heart.
I figure that'll make us even.
Now, you wanna know where this nigger is?
-We need to sit down and talk, Frank.
-I gotta see my son.
The man's right.
Let's grab a cup of coffee or something.
Not now, I need to get clean.
Sergei and them...
they did Mau Mau Willis.
-Why'd they chill him?
-He was welshing on the Jew.
Okay, Sergei's a soldier.
But he and Eton report to somebody.
-Who's above those two, Mike?
-I don't know.
-You don't know?
-Never did wanna know.
God in heaven, Zig,
the cops do that to you?
Ain't the cops.
Lawyers are saying the bail might be tough.
I'm trying.
You know I'm trying, right?
-What happened?
-I don't know.
I got tired.
I got tired of being the punchline
to every joke.
You had problems,
you could've come to me.
You could've said something.
You wouldn't have heard.
You were always too busy
dredging up the canal.
Making sure the right bum got elected.
Buying another round for the house.
I always used to think you were working
all them hours you spent away.
It was all work, Zig, even when it wasn't.
For you, for your mother.
I bet you didn't even tell her
I was in here, did you?
Maybe you did...
and she already took three Nembutals,
sleeping the day away.
-Leave her out of this.
-She's out of it, don't worry.
Pop...
when I seen what I did
to that kid down at the store...
it made me sick to my stomach.
-That ain't you, Zig.
-It ain't?
Because the same blood
don't flow for us, Pop.
I mean, I wish it did, but it don't.
You're more like me than you know.
You're a Sobotka.
Fucked is what I am.
What the fuck can I say?
Best progress so far
is "White Mike" McArdle.
He's standing on the edge of the cliff.
We're gonna get Pearlman in today
to see what she can do to step him off.
Also, we're still hunting
the Sobotka nephew.
Herc and Carver are on that.
Still, my guess is the drug players...
even if they roll, give us Eton and Sergei.
The case gets thin when we get up to this...
Spiros Vondopoulos.
Boy, them Greeks
and those twisted-ass names.
Lay off the Greeks.
They invented civilization.
Yeah? Ass-fucking, too.
What exactly do we know
about Vondopoulos?
We should stay on him, see who he really is.
How about it?
Throw us a few
of your well-equipped surveillance teams?
In case you haven't noticed, Lieutenant,
I'm the only fed still in the room.
The US attorney has what he wants
with the union guys...
which means my field office
is pretty much over this case.
Okay, we're on Vondopoulos ourselves.
I'm sorry for him...
and for you.
We should've paid more attention
to our own.
Like I could've stopped Ziggy
from what he'd done.
Like anyone could ever control him.
I was thinking of my boy, too.
They're dropping the net on all the guys.
Ain't no secret
things get lost in them cans now and again.
He'll be all right.
They tossed my house, Frank.
They don't do that when there's
a couple of cases of vodka missing.
They made me sign the search warrant.
That's a receipt-like for what they found.
Heroin, Frank. From this house.
No, that ain't right. That can't be right.
I knew Nicky and Zig was boosting stuff.
Cameras, shit like that. Nothing like this.
You knew?
And once Nicky got used to boosting stuff
and seeing a little money...
what did you think he was gonna do?
Turn straight all of a sudden and give it up?
No, Frank.
Once you gave him
a taste on the house, just....
That was never.... I mean, he knew. He knew.
Everything I did, the cans I let through...
the money we got from that
went to keeping what we had.
God damn it, Frank!
Don't let that excuse this. Not this.
Uncle Frank, with the big shoulders.
"If it's broke, give it to my uncle.
"He can fix it."
Hey, Killer.
I got something for you, come here.
You got the new Harper's yet?
Now, you know stores down the way...
don't have nothing past Vibe
and Handguns Today.
Some titty mags, too, if you need.
All right. I got you.
I'm gonna hook you up, though, all right?
Hey, boy. Told you I had something for you.
There you go.
That's my good boy.
Good day for a ship.
This is the hiring hall, Frank.
Working stevedores only.
Big Roy, let me have your card.
What do you want my card for?
Not you. Little Big Roy,
let me hold your card.
I need it.
I'm gonna work the Cape St. George today.
-I'll work it for you.
-Work it for me?
I work the ship on your card.
You work a barstool down Clement Street.
End of the week, you get paid.
Hey, Phil.
I'm putting up for the Cape St. George.
I don't see no resemblance.
We're both bald, we're both Polacks.
What the fuck else you need to know?
Who's gonna work for me?
-A different look for our boy.
-Perry Ellis or something.
How would a just-rolled-out-of-bed-looking
motherfucker like you...
know the designer?
Okay, I'm guessing.
It's a Joseph Abboud.
He puts dark buttons instead of brass
on his blazers.
That's the Abboud signature.
You know what they call a guy who pays
that much attention to his clothes, right?
A grown-up.
We're up.
-12-14, let's go.
-Copy, 1 1-34.
-That's a first.
-Sweat from a checker.
-You all right?
-Ready.
Maybe you ought to set up an easel
on the sidewalk...
-and do a sketch instead.
-I'm fine.
-Anything I ought to know?
-Yeah. Use the city.
Windows, mirrors, reflections,
anything like that.
Stay on my frequency, hear?
Vondopoulos should be coming out
of the garage on foot...
-right about now.
-Copy that.
Beadie Russell. She wasn't much
when we started, you know.
But now she's got game.
Thank you.
1 2-14. I got him going into
a fifth floor room.
Note the number
then get down to the lobby.
-Wait on him there.
-Copy.
She's got Vondopoulos in a room.
It could be a while.
Copy.
-All this shit's going out to chassis?
-That's what they tell me.
We need a forklift. We're almost done here.
12-14. Vondopoulos and another man,
middle-aged, blue suit...
Ieaving the front door of the hotel.
They'rejust behind me. Copy?
Copy.
1 1-34.
Subject and companion, blue suit,
leaving the hotel any moment now.
Copy, we got the eyeball.
The man with Vondopoulos
has got to be big.
-I mean, look at that expensive suit.
-Yeah, with them buttons and all.
We leave the Benz here?
It's hot.
They didn't come back to the Benz.
You got them down there?
Negative.
-You about done?
-These nine here still got to be stripped.
-Harder than it looks.
-What ain't?
-You hear how Moonshot got his name?
-Yeah, and I could give a fuck.
Who was the room registered to?
Stephen Rados.
He gave a Northwest D.C. address.
Maybe that's the man with the good tailor.
Maybe not.
We should run out the paper trail
on this guy, see what we turn up.
As to our only tangible piece of progress
from the raids...
what can we do for our friend White Mike?
He rolls on his suppliers,
and he can walk with a long probation.
-And we can move him, if he needs.
-Witness protection?
Why have the feds with you if they're
not gonna step up every now and then?
Wait a second. You're gonna give
a drug dealer a ride like that?
What about Frank Sobotka?
The feds took a shot at him and got nothing.
Or so they tell me.
The way I read it, they cared more
about busting up the union--
Than anything else in the case.
If we came at Frank straight?
You can't make him
any kind of specific offer yourself.
Only I can do that, and only after
I get an okay from my front office.
-She could plant the seed.
-There's no better messenger, Counselor.
Take a shot.
-You going to his house?
-The Union Hall. That's his house.
Thanks for waiting, Brucie. Sorry I'm late.
I shouldn't even be seen with you
at this point.
I just wanna settle our business
while we still can.
It ain't like I'm gonna get my hands
on more cash, obviously.
The grain pier is dead.
Half the votes we had lined up
are walking sideways now.
They read the paper, Frank.
So what? So I'm dirty.
The grain pier's still the grain pier, right?
They ain't voting for me, Brucie!
It ain't about me!
I'm not gonna lie.
No one is gonna stand with us
now that the FBI is on you.
-They're scared.
-Of what?
They took the money, Frank.
And now if they deliver the votes,
they figure the feds will be on them, too.
I'm sorry, Frank.
You find a way
of putting this FBI thing to bed...
maybe we can come back the next session
with the grain pier.
You'll have a couple of people down there
knowing they owe you a vote or two.
I don't know what else to say. I don't.
I'm sorry, Frank.
You know what the trouble is, Brucie?
We used to make shit in this country.
Build shit.
Now we just put our hand
in the next guy's pocket.
Come on, you can't eat only olives.
Order something. Lamb or something.
I'm not hungry.
All this trouble.
-So, our associates, they are strong?
-Yes.
I don't worry about our people.
We can try to get them out before the trial.
If not, they will stand for us.
We have shown them too much.
There will be no more trouble.
We must make certain of this.
-Maybe there's another way.
-There is only one sure way.
Hear me out.
If I could guarantee
that Frank Sobotka and his nephew...
would be silent...
wouldn't you prefer that?
But you cannot guarantee this.
Frank's son,
the idiot who shot George in his store...
he is going to jail for a long time...
unless....
There was a young clerk wounded that day
in the store.
The prosecutors want to use him
as a witness.
I know his family.
Frank Sobotka will have his son back.
If a man can have this,
why would he talk to the police?
What about Frank's nephew?
He is the idiot's cousin.
He wants the same thing as Frank.
Anyway, I don't worry about Niko.
You are fond of him, Spiros.
You should've had a son.
But then I would've had a wife.
If this maggot doesn't post by midnight,
I'm gonna take it personal.
The shitbird lives in his parents' basement.
Where's a guy like that gonna run?
You wanna go with Auntie Tasha? Come on.
Nice and easy, honey.
-Come here.
-All right, come on, baby.
What's up, big man? Where the party at?
Ain't no party up in here, girl.
We thought Darnell and everybody
was gonna get their smoke on.
Don't you know Darnell?
What's this good boy's name?
Hey, boy.
How you doing today?
You been good? This a good boy.
-There it is.
-Car will be running.
What is it, Lamar?
No need to prolong this.
No, we got time.
-You kill my man?
-No, he's resting.
-I'm saying, ain't you wanna know?
-Not particularly.
About a year ago, a boy name Brandon got
got here in Baltimore.
Stuck and burned before he passed.
-The game is the game.
-Indeed.
See, that boy was beautiful.
Wasn't no need for y'all to do him
the way y'all did.
You feel me?
-A year, you say?
-About that.
You've got some wrong information.
Man, you lying to live.
I'm at peace with my God.
Do what you will.
So you know?
What happened to your boy,
it's not my style.
The way you bleeding out your back,
looks like that bullet bore clean through.
9 mm at close range will do that.
Emergency. Do you need police
or ambulance?
I wanna report a shooting
over here at the new motel.
-On North Avenue. Room 221 .
-Sir?
My pal, Beatrice.
What, you gonna run me in again?
lsn't that like double jeopardy or some shit?
Stop it, just stop it.
-Talk to me.
-And say what?
I'm sitting here trying to figure it out myself.
It didn't happen overnight.
I knew I was wrong.
But in my head, I thought I was wrong
for the right reasons, you know?
There are different kinds of wrong.
What're you doing here, Bea?
I'd like you to come in. Not in cuffs.
Because you want to.
I'm opening a door here, Frank.
I can't promise you anything.
Just come in. We'll start from there.
You're better than them you got in bed with.
-Our man Vondopoulos didn't come home?
-Maybe he got lucky.
Maybe we didn't.
You think he ditched the Benz
because he picked up the tail?
Nicky from the docks.
If you hadn't called last night,
I'd have never found you.
Relax, Niko, come on.
It's like I told you on the phone.
It is going to be all right.
We can make it all right.
I should have never gone down the road
with you people.
Come on.
You tried to make something of yourself.
There's no harm in that.
And you still have friends.
I'm busted.
So is my uncle and the whole fucking union.
And Ziggy?
-Christ!
-We will be a friend to him, too.
Nothing your people can do about that.
Ziggy's done.
Nothing is done, Niko. Nothing.
Take a look.
That's not your name.
Many names, many passports.
We can do many things.
What can you do for Ziggy?
We ask only loyalty.
Why do they need sticks?
Can't they kick it with their feet?
She asked me straight-up to come in,
so I'm here.
First, we need to know
what you're looking for.
We don't want any misunderstandings
later on.
I'm just looking for, you know,
some help with my son.
-He can't jail where they got him.
-We move him to a county facility.
-What about my nephew?
-He gets arrested and charged.
But for his cooperation and yours...
we can live with straight probation.
But what we can and cannot do
for you and your family...
-depends on the level of your cooperation.
-You mean, how much I give you?
I got dirt on all of them.
I'll put myself in, too. Whatever you need.
Anything but the union.
I ain't putting in no union men.
I'll give you them dead girls in the can.
I'll give you The Greek,
all them sons of bitches...
just to have it off my chest.
Just look to my son and my nephew.
Mr. Sobotka, at this point
I have to advise you...
you need to retain
the services of an attorney.
We're not gonna do this now?
You need to have a lawyer
present in the room.
You have that, we can make this happen
first thing tomorrow.
Mr. Sobotka, I gotta ask.
Why did you stop using your cell phone?
You guys flagged it.
You think I didn't know?
Under the bridge?
It's out in the open.
I guess the cops can't bug it or nothing.
These guys,
they got a big operation to protect.
They're global-like.
-They're really something?
-You got no idea.
I think I got a pretty clear picture
of what they're about.
We ain't talking about a bunch of thieves
rolling drums of olive oil off the docks.
Heroin?
How the fuck did that happen, Nick?
Look at me!
You ain't much more than a kid.
Me, I should've known better.
I put you up with them, for what?
I flushed my fucking family, for what?
You know what that is, Nicky? Do you?
A condominium.
I ain't going down there.
What I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna go in and talk with the police.
That's right. I'm gonna do
to those cocksuckers what they did to me.
-You can't do that.
-Why not?
They wanna meet with us on Ziggy.
They can lean on that witness...
that kid that he shot,
the one that was there in the store.
The kid's gonna say that
Double G had the gun.
That it was like self-defense or some shit.
Ziggy could walk, Uncle Frank.
He could.
-And for that they want what?
-Loyalty.
-And for that they want what?
-Loyalty.
Motherfuckers!
I'll hear them out.
-All right, I'll drive.
-No, it's just me.
You ain't dealing with those guys no more.
-Uncle Frank, me and Spiros--
-I don't fucking want you with me, Nick!
Go home!
Your way...
it won't work.
WA YE news time, 8:05.
It's gonna be partly cloudy, breezy
and warm today with highs around 80.
Right now in Baltimore, sunny skies.
And here's one of my morning favorites.
Yo, Ott. Santo Rey's late?
Squall last night off of Hampton Roads.
76-72 KGA.
KGA, go ahead, 76-72.
Notify Homicide and the OCME.
We got a floater at Patapsco Terminal.
Copy that.
Nothing at Vondopoulos's house?
He's not going back.
He's dumped his Benz and our GPS device
in the downtown garage.
He's off the cell phones.
And there's no text messaging
in Greek either.
The raids, the follow,
one or both sent him underground.
This guy, Stephen Rados? What's he?
He rented the hotel room
for the meet with Vondopoulos.
But checked out right after.
Fitzhugh's running him
through every database.
So far, nothing but a driver's license in D.C.
Lester. Homicide for you, line 2.
Maybe Sobotka knows him.
When Sobotka comes in today, maybe
he gives us a line on every last Greek.
Freamon here.
Thirteen or so coming across the fax
from VICAP.
All of them John Does.
And that's just headless and handless
in the mid-Atlantic region.
If you wanna go nationwide,
you'll be up over four dozen.
-Fuck me.
-What can I tell you, kiddo?
We are policing a culture in moral decline.
So, you want to come get these?
Or should I have a uniform
run them over to Southeast?
-Run them over to Southeast.
-Okay.
-Have a seat.
-I can't.
Gotta get back out there,
take care of business.
Just wanted to make sure
they were treating you right.
Making the most of it.
I'm catching up on my reading at least.
I just want to let you know
that we got your back.
You know, whoever did this, we'll find them.
We got you, you understand?
I appreciate the offer,
but that won't be necessary.
Inform Mr. Barksdale that any obligation...
he feels he might have
with regards to this incident...
it's absolved, along with our agreement.
All I'm saying is--
I understand perfectly well
what you're saying.
What I am saying to you is:
I will take care of them myself.
Them?
Who came at you?
Thank you for your concern.
Easy, Nick. Easy.
I'm gonna kill them.
Fucking Greek bastards.
Get out of my fucking way!
Get off of me! Fuck all of you!
He was there for all of you,
and now you're nowhere for him.
What the fuck you gonna do?
Get a gun? Go play gangster?
Like your fucking cousin?
Let's go.
What was she firing, yo?
Dirty Bomb, with a red-top chaser.
Damn, yo. The bomb is the bomb.
Opportunity knocking. Keep a lookout.
He just boosted the whole fucking truck.
Good looking out, Johnny.
At least I remembered to call.
Stabbed repeatedly.
Torso, abdomen,
and they cut his throat to be sure.
Single-edge blade. He fought, too.
Defense wounds on both hands.
Ligature on both legs.
Weighed him down with something,
but it slipped off in the drink.
One, two, three.
Fuck it.
This Sobotka kid knows there's a warrant.
He either turns himself in or not.
Who gives a fuck?
Either we get to him now and roll him,
or he comes into the district with a lawyer.
He comes in with a lawyer, he's less likely
to go for something in the box.
You sound like McNulty now.
We stay with these guys on their cases,
we ain't never gonna get no respect.
You know this.
I figure when the detail's over,
I go back to straight narcotics.
Try to get over to Dawson's shift,
find a new rabbi.
What about you?
Don't know.
I mean, you gotta admit,
Daniels has been okay for us.
I mean, he's there for his troops.
-You gotta be shitting me.
-I just came from the crime scene.
He was coming in as a cooperator.
Offering up the drug-and-prostitution ring
he'd been smuggling for.
The guy lays down with gangsters,
gets up with his throat cut.
Almost feel sorry for the son of a bitch.
You were right about Sobotka.
Case had enough legs on it
that I've got Burrell committed...
to keeping my crew together
as a major case squad working out of CID.
If you are gonna charge him....
I'm gonna charge his narrow ass.
You're gonna do your son-in-law?
You don't think I didn't tell her
not to marry that brain-dead son of a bitch?
I'll tell you the truth, Major.
Everyone who saw the punch wrote on it.
And they've all got Prez
throwing the punch, no question.
But they've also got you addressing
a subordinate officer as a....
What was it? A shitbird?
Fuck you.
This is the Baltimore Police Department,
not the Roland Park Ladies' Tea.
I'm just saying, the other detectives...
I'm just saying, the other detectives...
the FBI agents,
they gotta write it the way it happened.
I mean, I could probably get my own people
to cheat it for you, but the FBl....
You know how tight-assed they are.
Roland Pryzbylewski rides
the Southeastern desk...
on midnight shift for two months.
During which time he writes
a personal letter of apology...
to everyone seen that punch throwed.
In which he makes it absolutely clear
that it was a penny-cheap sucker punch...
that would've got his ass kicked in
by a real police...
except for the fact that I have
my daughter's feelings to consider.
And then he can come up here
and say the same to my face...
and after that, if he wants
to piss his career away in your unit...
I could give a hairy-ass fuck.
Lieutenant.
Rod, that shit goes into a supplemental.
-You don't put witnesses on a face sheet.
-Officer.
You got something for Freamon?
Homicide sent it over.
Officer, my son wants
to turn himself in on a warrant.
Everybody talks, nobody listens.
Mike, that asshole calls back,
I'm in the shitter.
-Now what can I do for you, gents?
-You got a warrant on me for drugs.
-I'm turning myself in.
-A Southeastern warrant?
He's surrendering.
He's gonna cooperate in any way he can.
-What name am I looking for?
-Sobotka. Nicholas Sobotka.
Morphine? From a city ambo?
You should be ashamed
to be calling me on this one.
-The body came up.
-I saw, on the television.
We weighted him down
pretty goddamn good...
but the water just coughed him back up.
Bad luck, that's all.
Sergei would've done better, I admit.
Niko, the nephew. By now he knows.
Our people wait for him,
but so do the police.
I am thinking...
there's nothing to be done at this point.
What he says, he says.
He knows my name.
But my name is not my name.
And you?
To them, you're only "The Greek."
And, of course, I'm not even Greek.
So we go.
But there's a little business to do first.
There's a shipment on the docks this week.
-One hundred and fifty kilograms.
-And no one to pick it up.
Not just Sergei, I miss Frank, too.
We can't disappear the can.
But maybe we send someone.
Bring it off the docks, legitimate.
Everywhere we go these days,
we seem to be walking into police.
This is telling us something.
You're going to leave 15 million tholaria
to rot on the pier?
Lambs go to slaughter.
A man, he learns when to walk away.
No, we go.
Call the others in.
Let them know there is no longer any point.
We don't wait?
Our friends are still there, no?
-Still here.
-Then go.
Sobotka was a cooperator?
We had preliminary discussions
with him yesterday.
He agreed to post today
with a lawyer, but instead....
So what's left of the case?
We've pulled in everyone caught up
in the wiretaps, save for a couple bodies.
We left the man we think is the number two
for the operation...
on the street,
hoping he'd lead us to number one.
We have people on him?
He's out of pocket at the moment.
Last seen leaving a downtown hotel,
but we expect he'll resurface.
And the union people?
With Sobotka dead, the case right now
is limited to a subordinate or two.
But the important thing for us is the union.
Either they jettison
their current leadership...
or we have enough
to get that local decertified.
Leaving only me and my 14 bodies.
When do we get to that bit of business?
Lt. Daniels? Line 2. Det. Freamon
insisted I put him through.
In all likelihood, Frank Sobotka
was going to speak to that.
Now, we're a step back, sorry to say.
-Sobotka came in.
-The nephew?
Yeah, he flipped.
Come on, Bubs. You gotta do better
if you wanna walk on this.
-How about some murders?
-How about them?
They're not killing people
in West Baltimore these days?
Been quiet.
Except for that mess
with that young boy who got hit...
with the stray through the window,
ain't been nothing.
-How about that?
-I ain't got nothing on that one.
It's just two crews beefing over a corner.
You know what, Bubs? You going to jail.
How you gonna talk about going to jail?
You hearing this, Johnny?
Like we ain't got history in this room.
Like we ain't friends or nothing.
When you was up in that hospital,
all I did was worry.
"What about Kima? What's up with my girl?"
I'm just happy to see you're up in the mix...
and you talking about jail and shit.
That's too cold, girl, damn.
Remember that Eastsider
got shot in the high-rises, right?
You remember that shit, right?
I mean, you were right there, Bubbles.
That wasn't shit.
Boy got hit with a rat shot, that all.
-Who you talking about?
-Boy named Cheese.
Him and the other Eastsiders
moved into the Terrace...
took over a couple towers
from the Stringer Bell's boys.
Then some crazy-ass bow-tie nigger
came in and chased his ass home.
And what happened?
Mr. Bow Tie, he ran them off.
He told them Eastsider fools,
"Them towers belong to Avon."
But then he ain't come back no more.
Now them Eastsiders
are back up in there steady slinging.
I mean, it ain't like a war or nothing.
It's like Stringer Bell and them are sharing.
Sharing?
You guys are on all of it?
You have a public defender
sitting next to you, Mr. Sobotka.
If there's anything about this deal
you don't understand--
They killed my uncle.
I don't need to talk to no one
but you people.
How do you know they did it?
I told....
Spiros calls me
after everybody's getting arrested, right?
Tells me he wants us
to keep our mouths shut...
but Uncle Frank, he says he ain't gonna.
Says he's gonna go talk to the police.
Spiros says that if we keep quiet...
they can help my cousin, Zig, you know?
And now Spiros is saying that...
I don't know, the kid,
the one that didn't die...
the one that got shot...
he's gonna say that the gun, it wasn't Zig's.
That Glekas pulled the gun,
and it wasn't really Zig's fault.
So your uncle went to meet them
and talk about that?
Under the Key Bridge.
I seen his car was still there this morning.
I seen that, I fucking knew.
If they killed your uncle to shut him up,
they probably--
Wanna kill me, too?
Shit!
I was gonna go down with him
to the bridge.
I was gonna go down there with him.
He wouldn't....
You were involved in the smuggling?
We didn't know about the girls.
Them girls that got found?
-We didn't know there were girls in there.
-You thought it was drugs?
Drugs, stolen shit, whatever.
We got paid by the can
to creep shit off the docks. That's all.
That and selling the drugs
that you got from The Greek, too, right?
That's your cousin's signed statement.
He put himself in,
talked about buying the gun.
The bill of sale
from the pawn shop is in there, too.
It wouldn't have mattered if the
second victim had backed up on his story.
Your cousin was locked in.
Your uncle was sitting yesterday
right where you're sitting now...
ready to give us everything, if we made
the drug charges go away for you.
And maybe got your cousin
to a better lock-up than Eager Street.
As you can see,
we're willing to honor that deal...
even if it didn't happen for your uncle.
Spiros was the main guy.
He told me and Frank
which cans to disappear...
and then when it came to me and the drugs,
he was the one that hooked that up, too.
The lsraeli, he was their drug guy.
I went through him for all my re-ups...
until they passed me off
to White Mike McArdle. You know Mike?
Guess you do.
Double G was in charge of stolen shit.
Anything we could lift from the docks
went straight to his store...
but he's dead,
so why am I wasting your time, right?
Her, I don't know.
My uncle, you know about him.
I don't know
why you got Horse's picture up there.
Horse don't know shit. I'll testify to that.
What about the Russian?
He drove for them.
Anything that had to come off the docks,
he was their guy.
But I also got the feeling
that if somebody had to get hurt...
he was probably going to be around
for that part of it, too.
Why did you think that?
Sergei, he just carried it like that.
And also, after them girls died in the can...
they told me that whoever fucked that up...
they had already got to in Philly.
They said that
whoever did that to them girls was dead.
And how did they say it?
They just said, I don't know...
that the guy that you all was looking for...
he was a dead end.
-A dead end?
-Yeah.
In Philly, they said.
Who's the suit?
You sure?
We know that someone
is above your man Spiros.
Someone he was in communication with.
Yeah, The Greek.
Sure, I know who you mean.
I mean, I don't have a name or nothing.
The man in the suit...
the man with Vondopoulos
in the photograph.
That's not The Greek?
That's The Greek right there.
That the guy?
He picked out an Eastsider, all right.
Cheese runs with Proposition Joe's mob.
Had a few corners off of Ashland,
last I heard.
-What's the verdict?
-He did good for us.
-So I'm out the stat?
-I owe you one, Sanny.
-Both of them?
-Yeah, that one's his valet.
Can I use your bathroom?
Fuck, no. Get out of here.
Bubs, one last question.
How's product in the Towers?
It was shit, now it's right.
Found this guy.
Federal court computer down in D.C.
But not in a bad way.
He's a K Street lawyer down there.
So the suit was only a suit?
On the other hand, my friend,
this is from overseas.
A can on the Adriatica, which docks
the day after tomorrow at Patapsco.
Fake manifest out of Le Havre.
You people got reach.
That's about $300,000 in man-hours
we're holding here.
What's the plan for him?
You gotta call the US Attorney
about witness protection.
We're rounding up his girl and kid.
It's best we keep this as quiet as we can.
We already lost one cooperator.
It's for you.
Daniels.
Lieutenant, Fitzhugh's calling for WITSEC,
and we're pulling in the girlfriend and kid.
Okay, thanks.
FBl.
This is Special Agent Terrence Fitzhugh,
Baltimore field office.
-May I speak with Agent Koutris, please?
-Who?
Agent Koutris.
He's no longer
with the San Diego field office.
Where's he at?
You could try headquarters in Washington.
Counterterrorism.
Counterterrorism? For how long?
I'd have to check, but I'm sure
he's been gone from here more than a year.
Either he comes home
in the next five minutes, or I eat my gun.
I'm just saying, this is not the way...
me and you learned how to do it
in West Baltimore.
Not by a fucking long shot!
Either your son surrenders within the hour...
or all the police will come
crashing through this door twice a day...
for as long as it takes you people
to get the message. You hear me?
We will take this door once in the morning
and once at night, and toss your house...
until there isn't any furniture
with more than three legs left on it.
Officer, my son turned himself in
to the police last night.
At Southeastern.
A detective was there at the time.
-A detective?
-Motherfucker. Come on.
Don't use the phone.
There'll be an agent posted outside.
If you go anywhere, go with him.
What a dump.
You wanted us to get a place, right?
If they got to him in Philly...
then they probably dumped
the body in that area, right?
No use in dragging a headless torso around
further than you need.
Good God.
I bet you there's a police detective
somewhere else...
Iooking at a table full of heads right now.
In that stuff that we took off the ship,
did we keep any photos?
Couple of pictures of one guy
that left his gear, yeah.
They're at ECU.
You two should get on the road.
Get up there before the offices close.
Where y'all been at?
I'm saying, though, Butchie,
something just ain't feel right.
The man didn't even know
what I was saying.
So I just eased off.
-You think brother played me?
-No.
Y'all can't read lying eyes
after all these years...
then I'd be talking to a dead man.
You saying Stringer told you...
the brother had something to do
with your boy Brandon?
Yeah.
Near as I know, Brother Mouzone
spends most of his time up north.
New York and Philly.
If Avon contracted him to get at you...
the brother wouldn't have stop coming
until you two were bumped.
It's my fault.
I should've said no to Prop Joe
from the get-go.
Avon's father was plain evil,
and the son ain't no better.
Neither is Stringer,
now that we making a list.
I'm going hard after Stringer.
No point in trying
to talk you back down, I suppose.
You been my bank for how long
and gonna ask me something like that?
How you gonna get at him?
I don't even know, Butch.
Take some time and think on it.
One thing for sure, though,
the man got to be got, you feel me?
What you see, Butch?
Too much, boy.
Too damn much.
A lot happened overnight.
Not to us.
-Look, this isn't personal--
-Fucking-A, right.
We're not even people in this unit.
We're your goddamn pack mules.
"Sit on this house,
transport this mope, wait for that one."
That's part of the job.
The job had a little more rip-and-run to it,
the way I remember it.
These cases are more than that.
We're putting people in jail
with phone taps and typewriters.
So you're saying we ain't up to it.
I saw on the postings that Major Colvin
needs a sergeant in the Western.
Flex squad.
And the last time I checked, I had stripes.
Eastside, Westside.
Cats and dogs, sleeping together.
Shit. I'm late for something.
You say you want everybody
that came on the port that day?
No, we're looking for anything
out of the ordinary. Probably at night.
Oh, unusual. You should've said so.
-What you asked for before--
-That's what we....
You're right, sir, absolutely right.
Just see if there's anything like that.
Nope, all I got is usual.
All right.
Any way you could give us the name...
of the security officer
that was on this pier that night?
What was that date again?
February 5.
You had the Atlantic Light on that pier
from 6:00 p.m.
That was Walt. Walt Stokes.
Is he working tonight?
It's Tuesday. Walt's off on Tuesdays.
What do you want Walt for?
See if he can make any of these.
Wouldn't do much good.
Afraid Walt's not as up to speed
as the rest of us.
Seeing as you've come
all this way, though...
you might want to have a look-see
at the videotapes.
$300 for a stroller?
I know, I know.
Cost more than your first car, right?
A hooptie, no doubt?
We're so gonna need one of these.
Look at this, Kima.
Blue's Clues juice box holder.
If the kid can't hold on to a little old box
without no help, we got problems.
Okay, listen.
This baby is gonna come out of my belly
and need both of us, forever.
You understand?
I mean, it may not be real for you yet.
But, goddamn it, it's real for me.
Nick.
What's gonna happen, Nicky?
That can on the fifth wheel there.
By the plan, it's a hot box,
but there's no one on a pick-up.
-Where's it from?
-Le Havre, France.
Fuck it, then. Dump her.
Lester, the drug talk coming
from Proposition Joe's people...
before the warehouse phone came down.
Those were for steady re-ups, right?
We weren't up on that wire long,
but, yeah, three weeks in a row.
-How much?
-Five or six La-Z-Boys at a clip, to start.
Last call to Eton's cell phone,
the re-up went to 1 2.
He doubles his re-up to 1 2 kilos?
That's her right there.
They ain't doing the dirt, though.
Team leader,
keep an eye on that can till we post.
Copy.
Sorry to hear about my boy Sergei.
Eton, too.
You lost some good people.
There'll be some new faces soon.
A week or so. They'll find you.
Just as they'll find the others
that work with us.
A week?
I ain't got enough of your good shit
to last much past that.
You got anything to lay off
before you leave?
The last shipment is lost.
Lost? How you mean?
The police may be sitting on it.
You ain't sure?
There's more where that came from.
Always, there is more.
All right, then.
I'm gonna let your new people find me.
Have a safe trip.
Where you say you off to again?
There's 1 2 in this, 15 in that.
And if the rest of them
holds this same pattern....
Maybe 200 kilos of raw left on the pier.
The Greeks are definitely in the wind.
And we are in the dark.
You want us to take it down
to the customs shed, or what?
No, you're gonna seal it up and sit on it.
If we're lucky, someone will come
calling in a day or so.
You that lucky?
If they didn't get onto us when they did,
this might've been a hell of a case.
It's on you.
Ambushed? ln his own goddamn room?
Yeah, he gonna be all right, but he--
I don't give a fuck
about how he gonna be, man.
You put on out-of-town talent
at a high price...
you expect them
to get the motherfucking job done.
He said that thing between us is....
How did he put it? Absolved.
Absolved? What the fuck do that mean?
Mouzone booked out,
we worse off than when he came.
If word gets out on the street
that we weak like this...
how the fuck we supposed
to maintain our shit?
I know, but we gotta hit right back,
make a statement.
But Mouzone not saying who did this.
-You asked him who it was?
-Yeah, I asked him.
-Why?
-Why what?
How you gonna ask a soldier like Mouzone
a question like that?
Either he gonna say,
or he gonna go and work it out.
Either way,
you ain't got to be asking him shit.
Man, every market-based business
runs in cycles...
and we going
through a down-cycle right now.
String, this ain't about
your motherfucking business class either.
It ain't that part of it. It's that other thing.
The street is the street. Always.
Man, we gonna get through
this bullshit anyway.
No doubt.
You just need to hold tight till I get uptown.
And that day gonna come, but until then...
we gotta do what we can do,
when we can do it.
Yeah, you need to go to Prop Joe.
I ain't gonna argue with you.
You run it as you see fit.
At least until I get home, you do.
No doubt.
Us, man.
Us.
-Tape is fucked up.
-It's multiplexed.
It's a way to save money.
Instead of one camera, one VCR...
it's 10 cameras playing on one VCR tape.
-Can you make sense of it?
-Not a problem, with this software.
-We just de-plex it.
-De-plex?
Let me show you the highlight reel.
-Is he flashing a badge?
-Looks like it.
That's something you don't see too often...
John Law in a Mercedes-Benz.
That could be our boy.
Head still on.
Tell me we got cameras inside.
Jesus, my pants are wet.
Yeah. C'mon, baby.
Yeah.
Re-up gonna be about a week or so late.
My people are having to readjust
to some shit.
A week?
No later than that, they say.
How it go with Avon today?
It's all good.
Our old friend.
What's the news?
Port cops are sitting on a can
that came off the Adriatica.
Word around the customs shed,
it's full of dope.
I mean, about Frank.
-What's the district council saying?
-Gentlemen.
Mr. Pakusa, in light
of your pending indictment...
I'd think you'd stay as far away
from this hall as possible.
Ain't y'all got some place to go?
Just came to make it clear...
that if there's no cleaning up in here...
this local will be decertified.
Instead of your union
running out of this office...
it'll be a federal magistrate
down the courthouse deciding things.
Take the opportunity to elect new officers...
or the US Attorney will padlock the door.
And you'll be outside, looking in.
One man, one vote.
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?
Yes? Then it wasn't us.
You don't think that had anything to do...
with this mope?
You gotta do better than that, Lester.
This poor guy ain't got a face.
Did I mention the DNA matches?
This has nothing to do with me.
Is that the security guard?
Walt Stokes. A good man.
Keeps meticulous records.
Bunk, they tell me
you can enhance each frame...
to get a clear look.
Yeah? Show it to me.
I'll be damned. Maryland tags.
Juliet-Lima-Yankee...
5-4-5.
That comes back to a BWI rental.
I wonder who rented it.
This is aggravated murder and kidnapping.
In this state, it's a death penalty case.
I didn't kill him.
I was there, but I didn't kill him.
Vondas did.
He cut his throat.
The shepherd was supposed
to watch over the women.
Instead, he used them to make money.
One of the women, she fought.
She was killed.
And this idiot kills the rest
to make no witnesses.
He had to die.
You want a coffee? Soda?
Vodka.
Coffee.
They're down. All 14 of them.
Abated by the untimely death
of a known suspect.
Plus another clearance
on a John Doe case, just for laughs.
You wanna tell Rawls?
Let him stew a while longer.
One thing, though,
we should do right away.
Who's the man above Vondas?
The Greek.
What's his name?
You want a chance at anything
less than death row...
you're gonna tell me right now...
whatever it is you know
about where those bastards might be.
A hotel at the harbor.
This one?
Another.
I can show you.
Go.
Clear!
Business or pleasure for you?
Business. Always business.
-What did you forget?
-Nothing important.
You come to the bar without me?
Kiss my black cat's sister's ass.
-What happened?
-Case hit the wall.
How so?
The Sobotka nephew breaks for
the smuggling and the drugs.
The Russian breaks for the murder
that fucking killed my girls.
We were late on Vondopoulos
and The Greek.
-How late?
-They skipped.
We got interstate flight warrants out,
but from what the Sobotka kid says...
these guys collect passports.
We ain't even got a name
for The Greek yet, right?
What're we doing
with the drug end of the case?
I guess we could offer up Dixon
and Prop Joe to Narcotics.
See if they want
to follow through on their end.
I don't know.
I wouldn't be so quick
to throw Joe back into the pond.
A major case squad could have some fun
with that mess, don't you think?
Lieutenant.
I never told you this.
In fact, if you tell anyone
I ever told you this...
I'll finish my career
in fucking Montana or some shit.
Excuse me, sorry.
The leak wasn't your people.
When I called around
looking for info on your targets...
I used the FedCom software, you know?
I thought I was talking
to some fuck in San Diego.
The 9l1 1 boys in D.C.
I'm guessing Vondopoulos
or The Greek was an asset to them.
Hooked up like, I don't know,
who knows what?
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
World just keeps turning, right?
You guys move on to something new.
No one looks back.
It's on me this time.
Anyone?
Where are you going?
Work.
Frank, you cocksucker.
-I can take it from here.
-You sure?
No one fucks with us on our turf.
Where the fuck else am I gonna go?
How's it looking?
One ROIRO at North Point.
Graybeards grabbed that.
Nothing else today, really.
Seniority sucks.
If you ain't senior.
All right, man.
This is a great day for Baltimore.
Je sais pas. Je trouve Áa triste.
Les tours, c'ťtait chez moi.
Quoi, la citť va te faire chialer  ?
Y a un bail
qu'ils auraient dŻ tout faire sauter,

T'es fou  ? Chantay  ?

"T'arrÍtes pas de choper la chtouille,
tu continues pareil."
Putain  ! Je viens de marcher
dans une merde de chien.
Faut espťrer.
Putain.
C'est Cheese  ? Tu le vois  ?
<i>- Salut, il est oý  ?
- De qui tu parles  ?</i>
<i>Cheese. Je cherche Cheese.</i>
<i>Tíes pas censť donner de noms
au tťlťphone.</i>
<i>Tíes con ou quoi  ?</i>
<i>Mais jíai rien dit  !</i>
<i>Jíessaie juste de le contacter.</i>
<i>- Faut que je le voie, cíest tout.
- Il est lŗ oý il est, ducon.</i>
<i>Il est toujours au mÍme endroit  ?</i>
<i>Faut quíon se touche</i>
<i>pour un largage.</i>
<i>Faut quíil vienne me voir aujourdíhui
ou jíirai voir quelquíun qui fera líaffaire.</i>
<i>- Cíest tout. Dis-lui.
- Díaccord.</i>
"Faut qu'on se touche pour un largage"  ?
Qu'on se rencontre pour un nouveau deal.
Et aprŤs, Áa voulait dire quoi  ?
Il a dit:
"Ll faut qu'on fasse affaire aujourd'hui
"ou j'irai trouver quelqu'un d'autre."
Tu es vraiment bilingue.
<i>Faut que je le voie.</i>
<i>- Díaccord.
- Toujours pareil  ?</i>
<i>- Cíest ce que je lui ai dit.
- «a marche.</i>
Qu'est-ce que vous voyez  ?
Le second de Cheese a reÁu un appel.
Il vient de lui dire un truc et ils s'en vont.
<i>- Je vois. Líťcoute n'a rien donnť.
- Je míen doutais.</i>
Ils sont bien organisťs.
Líťcoute a ses limites.
Tout se dťcide quand ils se rencontrent.
«a fait trois mois
et on n'a toujours pas entendu sa voix.
Herc prend líallťe
et les bloque depuis Calhoun.
Alors, Truck et moi,
on remonte Stricker Street ŗ contresens  ?
Tu fais partie de la police, non  ?
Et on bloque aussi ces rues-lŗ
pour qu'ils ne puissent pas nous ťchapper.
…videmment, quand on va
leur tomber dessus,
líun d'eux va faire diversion.
Il va filer pour qu'on lui coure aprŤs.
Mais on ne s'en occupe pas.
On en arrÍte le plus possible.
On y va.
Carv.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe  ?
C'est un homme compliquť.
Il n'y a que sa femme qui le comprend.
Va voir un psy.
Les stups. Les stups  !
Les mains en líair  ! En líair  !
Les mains en líair, contre le mur  !
- Les mains en líair. En líair.
- Les mains en líair contre le mur.
- Me pousse pas.
- Allez, en líair.
On garde les mains en líair.
- T'as quelque chose  ?
- Et voilŗ.
ņ plus tard, petit. Bonne course.
C'ťtait leur came  ? Merde  !
Allez, on y va  ! On líintercepte sur Stricker.
<i>Je suis sur Calhoun. Oý tíes  ?</i>
Je líai perdu.
Je suis derriŤre Stricker, dans les 800.
Rien sur Riggs.
Il vient de traverser Stricker
et se dirige vers Gilmor.
Putain.
Un petit nous fait courir dans les allťes.
<i>- On peut avoir des renforts  ?
- Bien reÁu.</i>
<i>Dozerman, quelle est ta position  ?
Hť, Doze, tíes oý  ?</i>
<i>- Il a traversť Stricker  ?
- «a, cíest sŻr.</i>
Tout le monde...
Quel homme risquerait sa peau
pour un pote  ?
Il a fini sa course par ici.
…coute-moi, espŤce de petit merdeux  !
Je vais te dire un truc, un seul,
sur les gars de líouest avec qui tu joues  !
On ne perd jamais  !
Et on n'oublie jamais  !
Et on n'abandonne pas  ! Jamais  !
Alors je ne me rťpťterai pas.
Si tu te montres
et que tu nous laisses t'arrÍter,
on ne te tabassera pas trop.
Mais si tu nous obliges ŗ te courir aprŤs,
ou si tu nous obliges
ŗ revenir ici demain soir,
si on t'attrape dans la rue, je peux te jurer
qu'on va s'occuper de ton cas
comme personne, et Áa sera pas agrťable  !
Parce que tu ne gagneras pas,
petit merdeux. Les gagnants, c'est nous  !
LE R…GIME PARLEMENTAIRE
Maintenant, il faut qu'on s'empare
du reste des pavillons
et de tous les coins sur Fayette Street.
Qu'on s'en empare  ?
Et comment, M. Bodie  ?
- En disant "bouge de lŗ", point.
- T'as pas la parole.
On ne te lía pas donnťe.
On s'en empare comment  ?
J'en sais rien.
On n'a qu'ŗ leur faire comprendre
qu'on est sťrieux.
Genre, dťgage ou crŤve.
Comme ce que tu as fait
sur McCulloh Street lían passť  ?
On s'empare des lieux, on s'arme
et on attend que Áa tourne mal  ?
Non, on arrÍte de se prťoccuper
de territoire,
de rues ou de citťs qui nous appartiennent.
Líenjeu n'est plus lŗ.
On doit se concentrer sur la came.
Oui.
On a la meilleure came,
alors on va la vendre partout, compris  ?
La came, les gars. La came.
La parole est ŗ Slim Charles.
Nos gars doivent bien
avoir un territoire, non  ?
Toute la came du monde ne vaut rien
si on se fait tout le temps tabasser
parce qu'on n'est pas lŗ oý il faut.
Bon.
On opťrait dans six tours
dans la citť, non  ? En continu.
Mais on a dŻ en cťder trois
aux gars de Prop Joe
contre une came de meilleure qualitť
qu'on vendait lŗ-bas.
Vous croyez qu'on a perdu combien
en acceptant  ?
La rťponse, c'est que Áa nous a rapportť.
On a perdu du terrain,
mais vendu le double de came.
Le territoire,
c'est rien si on vend de la merde.
Demandez leur avis
ŗ ceux qui vendent des Ford Tempo
quand tout le monde roule
en japonaise ou en allemande
au pays aujourd'hui.
Le territoire, c'est que dalle.
Surtout quand on pense
aux bagarres liťes ŗ Áa,
ce qui entraÓne des morts,
et les morts font rappliquer
la police.
- Oui, mais comment on va...
- Hť.
On ne t'a pas donnť la parole.
- Comment on va dealer...
- LŤve-toi.
Comment on va dealer sans territoire  ?
Mais on a la meilleure came, non  ?
Alors il y a de fortes chances
qu'on se fasse une place
en offrant aux autres de les fournir
avec notre came.
Vous me suivez  ?
On se fait tous du fric
en se partageant la rue.
Slim Charles.
Mais s'ils refusent
de se fournir chez nous  ?
Je m'occuperai de ce problŤme
si le cas se prťsente.
En attendant, M. Charles, on va opťrer
comme de vrais hommes d'affaires.
On vend la came, on s'enrichit,
on laisse tomber la baston.
Oui.
T'es conscient
qu'on va passer pour des tapettes  ?
Enculť, tu vas voir  !
«a va pas de dire un truc pareil  ?
- Du calme.
- Quoi  ?
- Poot avait bien la parole.
- Ferme-la.
Il est trop con pour avoir la parole.
Va falloir regarder les choses
sous un autre angle, les mecs.
Commencez ŗ rťflťchir ŗ tout Áa
en hommes  !
Pas comme des petits dealers ŗ la noix.
Tu piges  ?
La sťance est levťe, cassez-vous.
Vous avez vraiment une sale gueule.
On a passť
des heures et des heures en planque.
- On devrait Ítre frais  ?
- Je suis fier de te connaÓtre.
- «a te va bien, cette tenue.
- Elle me mŤnera au succŤs.
J'ai vu cet enfoirť de Cheese
se faire approvisionner en came,
en vendre un max toute la journťe,
mais il n'a pas approchť un tťlťphone.
Un seul appel sur le portable
d'un de ses sbires ŗ trois mŤtres de lui.
Ce qui me ramŤne
ŗ ce dont je discutais avec le lieutenant.
Certains sont sur ťcoute
depuis presque six mois.
Leurs conversations ne nous ont permis
aucune grosse arrestation.
Alors, il est possible
que dans deux semaines,
on ne demande pas
ŗ poursuivre les ťcoutes.
On poursuit avec ce qu'on a,
on essaie de soutirer des infos
sur Cheese ou les hommes de Joe.
Tu plaisantes  ? On n'a rien pour líinstant.
Et ŗ ce rythme-lŗ, on n'aura jamais rien.
- Bon sang.
- Sur le papier, c'ťtait une bonne idťe.
LíenquÍte au port
nous a permis de rťcupťrer le numťro
des hommes de Prop Joe
et de les mettre sur ťcoute.
Si on arrive ŗ avoir autre chose
que du menu fretin,
on va voir Prop Joe sortir de sa planque.
Quand ce sera fait, Stringer suivra.
Líťcoute ne sera pas prolongťe
si elle ne nous mŤne ŗ rien.
Soit on fait des arrestations significatives,
soit on laisse tout tomber.
- Baker  ?
- Oui, major.
- Alors vous devez Ítre Castor.
- Oui.
- Agent Aaron Castor.
- De la mÍme famille que Lloyd Castor  ?
- Oui, major, c'est mon oncle.
- C'ťtait un bon flic.
Vous savez oý vous Ítes  ?
- Vous aussi. Oý Ítes-vous  ?
- Brigade ouest.
ņ cet instant prťcis,
on vient de vous tabasser
et vous appelez ŗ líaide.
Les renforts vous cherchent partout
parce qu'il ignorent oý vous vous trouvez.
«a veut dire
que je dois expliquer ŗ vos familles
comment vous avez trouvť la mort
sous mes ordres  ?
Major, nous sommes au 1034 North Mount,
au bout du rez-de-chaussťe.
Bien.
Maintenant, oý se trouve le nord  ?
Pointez-le du doigt.
Par lŗ, c'est líest.
Ne pensez-vous pas
que si vous poursuivez un suspect ŗ pied,
connaÓtre votre position
aiderait les renforts  ?
ConnaÓtre votre position
aiderait les renforts  ?
Les numťros pairs
vous indiquent le nord et líouest.
Numťros impairs, sud et est.
Des boussoles. Gardez-les avec vous
le temps qu'il sera nťcessaire.
Bienvenue dans ma brigade.
Messieurs, salissez un peu vos uniformes.
Et prenez un air plus intimidant.
Hť, Carv, t'es oý  ?
Je suis assis ŗ mon bureau
au rez-de-chaussťe du 1034 North Mount.
Mes pieds font face ŗ líouest
et ma bite pointe sud, sud-ouest.
Bunny Colvin faisait le mÍme discours
alors que vous ťtiez ŗ peine nťs.
Et toi, t'es oý, petit merdeux  ?
T'es menottť, chez moi,
comme un con, pas vrai  ?
Tentative de fuite  ?
ArrÍtť pour possession  ?
Vagabondage suspect
dans une zone rťsidentielle.
Je vais m'exprimer autrement.
Il avait de la drogue  ?
Il s'est enfui avec ce sac ŗ notre arrivťe.
On lía poursuivi et rťcupťrť le sac.
Mais pas de drogue.
- Et ils m'ont tabassť.
- ņ la mode de chez nous.
Et la leÁon de líhistoire  ?
Vous avez pris les chiens et líhťlico
pour me ramener un petit de 14 ans.
La leÁon de líhistoire  ?
C'est qu'on ne peut pas
s'enfuir en courant du secteur 1
sans finir par se faire botter le cul par moi.
Pas vrai  ?
C'est bon, je le tiens. Je le tiens, je te dis.
De la fonte. On peut en retirer 20 $ .
Ce serait mieux si c'ťtait du cuivre.
Ou si c'ťtait de líor.
Mais bon, faut faire avec ce qu'on a.
Oh, merde. Merde.
- «a va pas  ?
- Dťsolť.
- Trop tard.
- Putain, du calme.
On se calme  !
- On n'a pas besoin de Áa.
- Lŗ, t'as un problŤme  !
- Quoi  ?
- Regarde ce qu'ils ont fait ŗ ma caisse.
Fais ce que tu veux. Mais on m'attend.
Merci, c'est gentil.
Tout se paie.
- «a marche comme Áa.
- Mais on n'a pas d'argent.
On n'a pas un rond, d'accord  ?
On allait revendre cette ferraille.
On reviendra te dťdommager. C'est jurť.
Hť, dis, aprŤs avoir vendu la fonte,
faut qu'on s'achŤte des futals.
C'est clair.
<i>Une derniŤre question.</i>
<i>Si on regarde de prŤs les derniers mois
et si je lis le rapport correctement,</i>
<i>fusillades et agressions sont ŗ la hausse,</i>
<i>surtout dans le district est.</i>
<i>Peut-on supposer
que vous vous occupez du problŤme  ?</i>
<i>Je laisserai Bill vous rťpondre.</i>
<i>En tant quíadjoint aux opťrations,
je suis certain quíil est bien informť.</i>
<i>En effet.</i>
<i>Pour rťpondre ŗ votre question,</i>
<i>sachez quíon a renforcť
les effectifs des patrouilles</i>
<i>de 19 h ŗ 3 h
dans tous les secteurs du quartier est.</i>
<i>De plus, líťquipe mobile patrouille aussi</i>
<i>de 19 h ŗ 3 h</i>
<i>car cíest le crťneau horaire</i>
<i>oý nous constatons
une hausse des agressions.</i>
Conseiller
Thomas J. Carcetti
<i>Merci.</i>
<i>Díautres questions
pour ces chers messieurs  ?</i>
<i>Non  ?</i>
<i>Bien, alors on se revoit demain soir</i>
<i>pour parler du budget trimestriel.</i>
Erv, dites,
si vous le voulez bien,
j'aimerais qu'on parle un peu.
On dťjeune ensemble  ?
Avec plaisir, M. Le prťsident.
- Chez Werner, dans une demi-heure  ?
- Dans une demi-heure, entendu.
- Tu as vu Watkins au fond  ?
- Oui.
La femme avec lui, c'ťtait qui  ?
C'est lui, lŗ, en orange  ?
- C'est Drac.
- Notre dernier espoir.
Y a pas plus loquace que lui.
<i>- Tiens, ťcoute Áa.
- Non, non, non, líautre truc.</i>
<i>Le bon... Líautre truc, mec.</i>
<i>- Tu parles de lui  ?
- Non, díelle. Elle, je veux dire.</i>
<i>De la cocaÔne, mon pote, tu piges  ?</i>
<i>Bordel, espŤce de...</i>
«a faisait longtemps, non  ?
Dommage qu'il parle pas aux gros bonnets.
Pour líinstant,
Drac se fournit auprŤs de Lavell Mann.
Il deale au coin de Preston et Bond.
Il a failli nous refiler de bonnes infos.
Tu lías dit.
Sydnor le travaille depuis dťjŗ deux mois.
Lavell bosse pour Prop Joe.
Il ne risque pas de le dťnoncer.
C'est vrai.
Mais si on líarrÍte
pour avoir vendu ŗ un flic,
il faudra bien qu'il le remplace.
Pourquoi ce serait Drac  ?
- On sait quelque chose sur lui  ?
- C'est le neveu de Prop Joe.
Du cŰtť de sa mŤre.
BRIC-ņ-BRAC - R…CUP…RATION
20 $ et 2 $ .
Vous savez que vous Ítes en calbute  ?
Et Dominic est lŗ, il attend son tour.
Au moment de parler au Prťsident
qui dťtourne le regard,
Dominic passe derriŤre Carter,
- le saisit par la ceinture...
- Sa garde rapprochťe a dŻ avoir peur.
Il lui dit: "M. Le Prťsident,
on se souvient de moi  ?"
Et Carter se souvient bien de lui.
Il lui dit: "Oui, Dominic DiPietro
de Baltimore, lors de la campagne."
Il reste imperturbable.
Il regarde Carter dans les yeux
et lui dit:
"Oý est líargent promis il y a trois ans
"pour refaire mes rues  ?"
- Incroyable.
- «a, c'est rien.
AprŤs avoir perdu contre Reagan,
Carter revient
pour une soirťe de collecte de fonds
et Dominic est lŗ.
Carter s'enquiert de sa santť,
Dominic lui dit:
"Fils de pute, j'attends toujours
mon argent pour refaire mes rues."
Non  !
Sans blague. Carter sourit toujours
en grinÁant des dents.
Un type attrape Dominic et le fait sortir.
Le type lui dit: "Bon sang, Dominic,
"tu viens d'insulter
le Prťsident des …tats-Unis."
Il hausse les ťpaules:
"Je líemmerde. Il a perdu les ťlections."
Bon sang, elle est bonne. Quelle histoire  !
Voilŗ ce qui m'inspire.
Je suis un digne hťritier de ce combattant.
Mais ŗ vrai dire,
je ne veux pas connaÓtre
le mÍme sort que Dominic DiPietro,
et cirer le banc de touche.
La ville connaÓt de grandes difficultťs.
On perd de 10000 ŗ 12000 rťsidents
chaque annťe.
Quand on leur demande
ce qui motive leur dťpart,
que rťpondent-ils  ?
- Les ťcoles.
- Et la criminalitť.
Les ťcoles et la criminalitť.
Voilŗ pourquoi on rťcupŤre moins d'argent
- líaddition, s'il vous plaÓt.
- Et vous savez quoi  ?
Soyez malin,
venez me voir quand il coupe votre budget,
ce qui vous empÍche
de travailler efficacement.
On vous traite mal, venez me voir.
Sans que Áa se sache.
Vos obligations vous en empÍchent.
Mais passez par la porte de derriŤre,
je peux influer sur le sous-comitť
pour vous procurer le nťcessaire.
Merci.
- C'est gentil.
- Erv, je peux vous aider.
On peut amťliorer la situation...
Mais il y a longtemps,
au tout dťbut de ma carriŤre,
j'ai eu la chance d'Ítre informť
sur le fonctionnement de la hiťrarchie.
Et pour líinstant, en ma qualitť
de prťfet de police par intťrim...
je suis sous les ordres du maire Royce.
Le cafť est pour moi.
Laissez un pourboire si vous voulez.
Pourquoi tu voulais me voir  ?
- Tu sors demain, c'est Áa  ?
- Oui.
On pourrait s'aider mutuellement.
- Tu vas faire quoi en premier  ?
- Hein  ?
Demain. Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire  ?
J'en sais rien.
Moi, je le sais. Pas toi  ?
Je sais ce que tu vas faire en premier.
Je vais rentrer chez moi.
Temps mort  !
On reprend  !
Attention au trou. Attention au trou.
Le futur homme libre.
Plus qu'un jour ŗ tirer, hein  ?
- Un de fait, il t'en reste plus qu'un.
- Oui.
Comme on dit:
On ne fait que deux jours.
- Le jour oý on entre...
- Le jour oý on sort.
Je dirais pas Áa. J'ai passť 14 ans ici.
Bon, d'accord.
T'as fait un peu de rab, c'est vrai.
Mais t'es toujours de la partie, hein  ?
Tu sais qu'ils ont dťtruit les tours  ?
La citť  ? Les pavillons  ?
Il en reste plus rien, mon pote.
Beaucoup de choses ont changť en 14 ans.
Tu vas voir.
- Tout change.
- Tu lías dit.
Mais tu sais.
Y a certains trucs qui bougent pas.
On continuera toujours ŗ dealer.
Le truc,
c'est que comme ils ont dťtruit les tours,
il va falloir que je fasse
mes affaires ailleurs. Tu piges  ?
Tu sais que je vais bientŰt sortir, pas vrai  ?
ņ la premiŤre audience qu'on m'accorde,
je sors. C'est sŻr.
«a va bien se passer.
Je vais rentrer...
Merde  !
Certains vont le regretter.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire  ?
Je vais avoir besoin d'Ítre bien entourť.
Prends ce numťro.
Quand tu seras dehors, appelle.
On va t'aider, mon pote, t'en fais pas.
Prends Áa comme un cadeau de bienvenue.
«a marche  ?
Appelle.
La prison lía peut-Ítre cassť.
Tu parles d'un frŤre
qui a foncť sur Elijah Davis pour le tuer.
En plein jour, au coin de Pennsie et Gold.
AprŤs, il a appelť les secours
et dit ŗ la police: "Je viens
de buter un mec, venez m'arrÍter."
Ce gars-lŗ peut pas Ítre cassť.
…PICERIE McCall
On avait les 20 $,
mais on a dŻ s'acheter des futals.
Alors, si tu veux bien commencer
par prendre Áa,
on t'apporte le reste demain.
Quand on viendra chercher une autre dose.
Il en veut deux pour 16 $ .
J'essaie d'en avoir deux. J'essaie.
De ce petit enculť.
Non.
Allez, il nous en manque juste un peu
mais demain, je reviens avec les 4 $...
Joey a dit non.
Le salaud.
ņ ces prix-lŗ, je ne peux pas
vous accorder plus d'ťcoute.
J'en suis bien conscient.
Pour líheure, on planifie
un ťchange de drogue avec un des leurs,
quelques rangs plus bas
que Proposition Joe.
Pour lui soutirer des informations  ?
Il y a peu de chances qu'il parle.
Joe les a bien formťs.
On espŤre qu'ils monteront en grade
un petit dealer dťbile
pour le remplacer. Un certain Drac.
Il est sur ťcoute.
S'il est promu, il parlera peut-Ítre ŗ Joe
ou aux gros bonnets autour.
Si on en arrive lŗ,
Stringer Bell refera peut-Ítre surface.
Et vous pensez
qu'ils vont promouvoir un imbťcile  ?
On le fait tout le temps.
En parlant de promotions, comme promis,
j'ai envoyť votre dossier ŗ la mairie.
- Et  ?
- Le maire retarde les choses.
Je crois qu'il attend de voir
ce que va faire votre femme.
- Ma femme  ?
- Oui.
Il paraÓtrait
qu'elle cherche ŗ Ítre ťlue au conseil.
Peut-Ítre pour mettre
Eunetta Perkins dehors.
- Cela ne regarde que ma femme.
- En effet.
Mais le maire
voit Eunetta comme une alliťe.
Je devais avoir le contrŰle de mon unitť
et le prochain poste de major.
Vous avez votre unitť.
Et j'ai transmis votre candidature
ŗ la mairie. J'ai tenu parole.
Mais le maire,
il veut peut-Ítre savoir qui le soutient
avant de promouvoir qui que ce soit.
Oý elle a dit qu'elle allait s'asseoir  ?
PrŤs du banc des remplaÁants,
cŰtť premiŤre base. Elle va arriver.
Quand est-ce qu'elle doit te les amener  ?
Au milieu de la quatriŤme manche.
Papa, je peux avoir un hot-dog  ?
Oui, dŤs qu'un vendeur passera par lŗ.
D'ailleurs, oý est le gars
qui vend les biŤres  ?
Ils sont lŗ.
Bon sang. Ils sont super bien placťs.
Putain.
- Quoi  ?
- C'est qui, le mec en costard ŗ sa gauche  ?
- Un simple ami  ?
- Non, il se la fait.
Qui peut venir assister ŗ un match
en costard et rester pendu au tťlťphone  ?
Un avocat.
Un gars riche dans ce genre-lŗ.
- Dommage qu'on n'en ait pas plus.
- On en a chiť pour une demi-dose.
On s'en sortira mieux demain, Bubs.
T'es quel genre de junkie
pour parler de demain  ?
Demain, Áa veut rien dire.
Aujourd'hui, Johnny. Aujourd'hui.
J'ai dťgotť cette foutue fonte.
Je líai traÓnťe comme un chien.
J'ai failli me faire tuer pour une caisse,
j'ai dŻ supplier qu'on me tue pas.
J'y ai laissť mon futal, mec,
mon putain de futal.
Je supplie encore un autre gars
pour une demi-dose  ?
Je te jure, et je suis mÍme pas dťfoncť.
- On vient de se louper une action, papa.
- Ah oui  ?
Nos places sont super.
On est quasiment sur le terrain.
Oui, mon ami, Dennis, sa boÓte
lui donne des billets de temps en temps.
- Oý t'es installť  ?
- Tout en haut. Venez.
Non, votre pŤre
ne vous a pas vus de la semaine.
Et qu'ils gardent leurs manteaux.
Sean sort d'un rhume.
D'accord  ?
Jimmy, c'est Áa  ? Dennis Kerpelman.
Vos gamins sont super.
Enfin, ravi de vous avoir rencontrť.
- Je te ramŤne quelque chose  ?
- Non, merci.
Partez avant la fin du match,
ils ont ťcole demain.
Salut.
Il y a des giclťes de sang dans
deux directions diffťrentes, sur la route.
<i>- J'ťcoute.
- On a une fusillade dans líouest.</i>
Encore une autre  ? Bon sang, oý Áa  ?
<i>Au coin de North et Pulaski.
Envoyez-y Cole.</i>
Il est dťjŗ occupť ailleurs.
Appelez Crutchfield.
Voyez s'il a fini de son cŰtť.
<i>- Crutchfield  ?
- Sinon, appelez Bunk chez lui.</i>
<i>- Cíest son jour de repos.
- «a ne líest plus.</i>
J'adore cette ville.
Perlozzo n'hťsite pas
ŗ virer un lanceur du terrain.
J'ai envie de devenir une femme.
CacahuŤtes ťpicťes  !
C'est le boulot. J'ťcoute.
Je suis au match.
Au match.
Oui, mais pourquoi pas Cole  ? Appelez-le.
Oh, merde.
D'accord.
Incroyable. Il y a eu cinq meurtres ce soir.
Faut que j'aille travailler
pendant mon jour de repos.
Cinq  ?
«a devient de la folie.
Bon, ťcoute.
- Je dois aller travailler, d'accord  ?
- Oui.
M. Jimmy va...
Il va te raccompagner ŗ la maison.
Je te laisse.
Repose en paix
Salut, maman.
<i>- Et Erdman Avenue  ?
- Pas díinformation balistique.</i>
<i>Vous en Ítes certain  ?</i>
<i>Prenez votre temps, major.</i>
Quel enfoirť, ce Carcetti.
Il croyait que j'allais trahir le maire.
<i>Quand vous voulez, Marvin.</i>
Un conseiller blanc
pourrait me donner plus qu'un maire noir  ?
Non, tu as bien fait.
<i>Un calibre 38 a ťtť utilisť
sur Erdman Avenue.</i>
<i>Alors vous me dites
que plutŰt que de rapprocher cette affaire</i>
<i>ŗ tous les vols
commis sur Monument Street,</i>
<i>vous avez choisi
de mettre diffťrentes ťquipes dessus.</i>
<i>Non, chef, trois de ces vols
concernaient des commerces,</i>
<i>alors on les a envoyťs ŗ la criminelle.</i>
<i>- Mes hommes avaient la responsabilitť...
- Bon sang, Marvin  !</i>
<i>Venez-vous díutiliser
le mot "responsabilitť"</i>
<i>pour expliquer
pourquoi vous avez foirť ce coup-lŗ  ?</i>
<i>Je me trompe  ? Je crois
que vous ignorez le sens de ce mot.</i>
<i>Quand je lis les rapports quotidiens,
je vois clairement</i>
<i>quíun connard armť díun calibre 38
met ŗ feu et ŗ sang tout le district,</i>
<i>de Greenmount
ŗ cette putain díEdison Highway.</i>
<i>Cíest en agissant ainsi
quíon arrive ŗ se retrouver</i>
<i>avec cinq meurtres
en une seule nuit, messieurs  !</i>
- Putain, pauvre Marvin.
- Autant que Áa tombe sur lui que sur nous.
Avec ton tťmoignage,
le deal suffira ŗ le faire coffrer,
mais si t'arrives ŗ le faire parler,
c'est encore mieux.
Tu es sŻr
que ce gars veut te vendre de la drogue  ?
Faudrait pas brusquer les choses.
«a fait deux mois
que je le travaille au corps.
Ce n'est pas ce qu'il t'a demandť.
Ce type est prÍt ŗ Ítre cueilli, Kima.
C'est du tout cuit.
Ils sont prÍts ŗ y aller.
Tu dors dans ton bureau, Cťdric  ?
Bon, Drac sera promu
si cette opťration marche.
En route.
Et faites en sorte de revenir.
«a me paraÓt bien lťger,
t'es sŻr qu'y a le compte  ?
T'inquiŤte. J'essaie pas de t'avoir,
c'est la dose rťguliŤre.
Bon, si je la trouve bonne,
je t'en prendrai trois,
peut-Ítre quatre fois par semaine.
- Oui, Áa pourrait le faire.
- «a marche  ?
«a marche.
- C'est bon.
- On le coffre.
- Quelqu'un m'a balancť  !
- La ferme  !
On y va, Lavell.
C'est Cutty.
On m'a dit que tu m'aiderais.
LíOxbow  ?
LíOxbow sur Laurens, ŗ Fulton. D'accord.
Putain.
<i>Je dis quíils ont arrÍtť Lavell
avec 30 grammes.</i>
<i>Il sera peut-Ítre
mÍme pas question de caution.</i>
<i>Ils risquent de lui tomber dessus,
quelque chose de grave.</i>
<i>Et Joey va devoir donner
la place de Lavell ŗ un autre.</i>
<i>- «a pourrait Ítre moi.
- Un vrai moulin ŗ paroles.</i>
ņ t'entendre,
on dirait que c'est une mauvaise chose.
Espťrons qu'on ťcoute
le candidat ŗ la promotion.
J'ai entendu parler de toi.
T'ťtais plutŰt connu dans le temps.
T'as quelque chose pour moi  ?
Tu vois le petit qui est assis lŗ  ?
Regarde sous les marches.
Quand tu seras prÍt,
on aura du vrai boulot pour toi, d'accord  ?
Putain.
Salut. Comment Áa va  ?
Bien.
- On parlait justement de toi.
- Ah oui  ?
- Denise, de la confrťrie.
- Bonsoir.
Tu connais Charles, bien sŻr.
- Ravi de vous voir.
- Pareillement.
Je ne crois pas
que tu connaisses le dťlťguť Watkins.
- Enchantť.
- Ravi de vous rencontrer.
Vous donnez une bonne image
dans votre uniforme de lieutenant.
- C'est bien pour notre campagne.
- Est-ce si important  ?
Celle que Marla veut remplacer
est en poste depuis longtemps.
- Le moindre dťtail est important.
- Eh bien, si je peux vous aider...
Je vous laisse travailler.
Marla, je tiens ŗ te dire
que la photo de Cťdric et toi rend bien
sur nos enveloppes.
Oui. J'espŤre qu'il sait ce qui líattend,
parce que la campagne va Ítre longue
pour vous deux.
«a ne va pas Ítre facile.
En parlant de Áa, je dois faire...
Bon sang. Qui a appelť les journalistes  ?
<i>Je croyais avoir fait mes preuves,
quíil me filerait sa place.</i>
<i>- Mais non.
- Pourquoi  ?</i>
<i>Parce quíil va remplacer Lavell
par ce dťgťnťrť de Cheese.</i>
<i>Et tu sais quoi  ?
Joe, cíest mon oncle, merde.</i>
<i>Je suis de la mÍme famille
que ce gros enculť.</i>
Si cet idiot travaillait pour nous,
il serait dťjŗ prťfet adjoint.
On n'a vraiment pas de chance
dans cette affaire.
<i>Et comment, honnÍtement, puis-je,
en tant que prťsident de ce sous-comitť,</i>
<i>autoriser encore plus de dťpenses</i>
<i>quand les papiers que jíai lŗ montrent</i>
<i>que líargent ne va pas ŗ ceux
qui travaillent dur sur le terrain,</i>
<i>mais sert ŗ payer des chauffeurs,
des employťs...</i>
<i>Et bon sang, regardez,
afin que deux colonels</i>
<i>et trois majors aillent assister
ŗ un sťminaire ŗ Miami, en Floride.</i>
<i>M. Le prťsident...</i>
<i>Comment un sťjour en Floride
va vous apprendre</i>
<i>ŗ rendre Baltimore une ville plus sŻre  ?</i>
<i>Je níen ai aucune idťe et vous non plus,
cíest une honte.</i>
Cťdric, ils sont partis.
Merci beaucoup d'Ítre venu.
Pas de problŤme.
Ce n'est pas facile, je sais.
Mais ils semblent croire
qu'il est important que je me prťsente...
Je comprends.
Tu m'as soutenu
pendant toutes ces annťes.
C'est le moins que je puisse faire, non  ?
Bonsoir.
On ne le prive de rien dans son district.
Travaux, patrouilles, ťclairage public...
Il touche sa part.
ņ moins que ce ne soit pas son district
le problŤme,
mais lui.
Il convoite peut-Ítre
quelque chose en particulier.
Comme quoi  ?
Pas moi, pas mon poste,
pas dans cette ville.
Non. Si ce type ťtait encore plus blanc,
on verrait ŗ travers.
Mais si c'est bien Áa, je líattends.
- En fait, qu'il vienne, Seigneur.
- Ou peut-Ítre Jean-Baptiste.
T'affaiblir pour le compte d'un autre.
- S'il veut nous avoir avec la criminalitť...
- M'avoir, moi.
…coutez, y a-t-il un moyen
que vous lui parliez  ?
- Qu'il arrÍte de m'emmerder  ?
- Il est du premier district.
On ne peut pas leur demander grand-chose.
Il faut lui dťmontrer qu'on agit, non  ?
Faire que ceux-ci
ne dťpassent pas les 250 cette annťe.
Sauf votre respect, M. Le maire,
on en est dťjŗ ŗ 232.
Que pouvez-vous faire concrŤtement  ?
Dans le meilleur des scťnarios,
avec des heures supplťmentaires,
on peut s'arrÍter ŗ 275, peut-Ítre.
- 275, bon sang.
- Nous avons votre parole  ?
275,
et ce connard de Carcetti
ne pourra pas se plaindre.
<i>Je tiens de mes supťrieurs que
le taux de criminalitť, district par district,</i>
<i>doit baisser de cinq pour cent
díici la fin de líannťe.</i>
<i>Jíai toujours rÍvť de dire Áa,</i>
<i>ce níest pas la peine de revenir vivant.</i>
<i>De plus, nous ne devons pas connaÓtre
plus de 275 meurtres.</i>
Bon sang.
<i>On est un peu dťroutť, colonel Foerster  ?</i>
<i>On souffre de dyspepsie  ?</i>
<i>De dis-quoi  ? Non, chef. «a va.</i>
<i>Voilŗ qui vous fera rire un peu.</i>
<i>Si on avait la population de New York,</i>
<i>on en serait ŗ 4000 meurtres par an
ŗ ce rythme-lŗ.</i>
<i>Je níaccepterai aucune excuse.
Peu míimportent vos mťthodes.</i>
<i>- Mais agissez, bordel.
- M. Le prťfet adjoint,</i>
Líenvironnement urbain et sa criminalitť,
on connaÓt Áa bien.
Je crois qu'on comprend tous
qu'il est en effet possible
de rťduire
le nombre de certains actes criminels.
On peut reclasser
des violences avec voie de faits,
ne pas faire de rapport sur un vol
faute de preuves,
mais comment fait-on disparaÓtre
un cadavre  ?
Vous avez tous ťtť nommťs ŗ vos postes,
sans exception.
Si vous voulez continuer
ŗ porter vos dťcorations,
fermez-la et agissez.
Si líun de vous
ne nous permet pas d'y arriver,
il sera vite remplacť
par quelqu'un qui le fera.
Ce sera tout.
Bon sang, Bunny,
qu'est-ce qui t'a pris  ?
Dans six mois, je toucherai
ma pension de retraite de major.
Ils ne peuvent pas me faire grand-chose.
De líhťro, des capsules rouges.
- Une autre idťe brillante  ?
- Pourquoi pas des micros  ?
Des micros  ?
Oui, on en cache aux coins des rues,
lŗ oý traÓnent ces crťtins.
J'ai bien observť vers Ashland hier:
Bennes ŗ ordures, mauvaises herbes,
on pourrait s'en servir.
On cache un micro au bon endroit
au bon moment: On pourrait gagner.
On n'a pas les effectifs nťcessaires.
Sans parler de líargent.
Et pour quel rťsultat  ?
Il nous manque une cible de choix.
ArrÍtons les ťcoutes,
poursuivons avec ce qu'on a et passons.
On a fait Áa il y a deux ans
et un enculť se promŤne en toute libertť.
Vous me dites qu'on va encore laisser
ce fils de pute m'avoir  ?
Combien de fois on va laisser
ce fumier de Stringer s'en tirer  ?
Pour qu'il amasse
encore 200 millions de dollars.
- Il n'y a pas que lui, McNulty.
- Stringer est notre cible.
C'est le dealer le plus important.
Vous le savez bien, lieutenant.
Ne le laisse pas l‚cher líaffaire.
C'est toi contre le monde, pas vrai  ?
Bordel, qu'est-ce que j'ai fait  ?
Des capsules rouges, de líhťro  !
T'en veux  ?
Casse-toi de lŗ, connard.
Si t'en veux, vois Áa avec mes petits bras.
Non, j'en veux pas. Je vends.
On dirait bien
que c'est avec toi qu'il faut parler.
T'as líair d'Ítre le boss dans le coin.
T'es de la police ou quoi  ?
Si je suis de la police, t'es le pape.
Je viens de passer 14 ans
enfermť ŗ Jessup.
On m'a refilť pour 1000 $ de came
en cadeau de bienvenue.
Pourquoi tu la vends pas toi-mÍme  ?
Je viens ŗ peine de sortir de taule.
Faut que je me tienne ŗ carreau.
- On fait moitiť-moitiť.
- Tu dťconnes.
- C'est tout bťnef pour toi.
- Je risque de me faire choper.
Qu'est-ce qui te dit
qu'on me surveille pas, moi aussi  ?
Soixante-quarante.
«a marche. Passe le matos ŗ mon second.
- Il s'en occupera. Et repasse ce soir.
- D'accord.
<i>Et une derniŤre chose, messieurs.</i>
<i>líhťlico a survolť le commissariat
il y quelques jours</i>
<i>et a eu le bonheur de voir 700 ŗ 800
cadavres de biŤres sur le toit du garage.</i>
<i>Un peu de sťrieux,
níallez pas boire lŗ aprŤs votre service.</i>
<i>Si vous vous retrouvez avec une biŤre,</i>
<i>ne jetez pas la canette sur le toit,
ramenez-la chez vous.</i>
<i>Cette note de service vient directement
de notre cher prťfet adjoint aux opťrations.</i>
<i>Voilŗ, vous pouvez y aller.</i>
<i>Ne vous faites pas prendre.</i>
Repos.
- Du nouveau  ?
- Rien de bien important.
Je vais faire un tour dans le district
avant líarrivťe de líadjoint.
Si on me cherche, contactez-moi par radio.
Vente  ?
Possession.
- Avec intention dťlictueuse.
- Ah oui  ?
Et ils faisaient les cons
en prťsence d'agents assermentťs.
V'lŗ les keufs.
Voilŗ la relŤve de nuit qui arrive.
C'est quoi, tout ce bazar  ?
Si on ne comprend pas oý on a foirť,
on refait les mÍmes conneries.
Je m'en vais.

Des capsules rouges  ! Hťro, crack  !
Il est oý  ?
De líhťro  ! J'ai de líhťro  !
Qu'est-ce que tu regardes  ?
- Quoi, tu veux te faire sucer  ?
- Je veux mon fric.
C'est vraiment pas de chance.
La police a fait une descente,
ils ont saisi pas mal de matos.
Le tien y est passť. C'est con, pas vrai  ?
- T'as un numťro  ?
- Un numťro  ?
Dans le temps, quand un mec disait
que la police avait saisi la came d'un autre,
il devait en donner la preuve.
Disons que les temps ont changť.
Tu commences vraiment ŗ me faire chier.
Casse-toi, connard.
Il est vraiment ŗ la ramasse, ce vieux con.
J'ai de líhťro.
Trois doses pour le prix de deux.
- Quoi  ?
- T'en veux  ?
De líhťro. Trois doses pour le prix de deux.
«a t'intťresse ou pas  ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fais, mec  ?
Je rÍve  ! Quel bleu  !
T'as pas vu que c'ťtait un keuf  ?
À ce moment-là, on arrive sur Carlton.
Et cet enculé de Blanc
et sa femme arrivent en bagnole.
Il me fait: "Savez-vous où se trouve
la maison de Poe ?"
Je lui dis: "Tu déconnes, papy ?
Tu crois que les gens ont du pot ici ?"
Alors le vieux répond:
"La maison de Poe.
La maison d'Edward Allan Poe."
Merde, t'es déjà de retour ?
J'ai touché mon chèque.
Je lui fais:
"Je connais pas d'Edward Allan Poe."
Le mec me mate d'un air triste,
comme si je l’avais déçu.
- Vous savez que vous pouvez pas entrer.
- Quoi ?
Hé, bas-du-cul, je te connais pas.
Tu connais Mlle Elaine, de l’arrière-salle ?
C'est son frère, Earl, de l’hôpital militaire.
Il va habiter avec elle.
Vous pouvez m'aider à entrer ?
Je m'appelle Chantal.
Ça va ?
Merci, jeune homme.
Merde !
Merde !
Non, non, non.
Hé, Omar.
Sans vouloir te manquer de respect,
c'est une planque de Barksdale ici.
Sans blague.

BALTIMORE CAPITALE DU CRIME
"ll n'y a jamais eu de sac en papier"
- Colvin
Vous croyez que ce garçon
s'est réveillé hier matin,
qu'il s'est assis sur son lit en disant:
"C'est aujourd'hui que je meurs’ ?
Vous pensez
que ça ne peut pas vous arriver ?
Montrez-leur, docteur.
Regardez ce que cette balle a fait
à son cœur.
C'est son cœur.
- C'était quoi, l’éducation par la peur ?
- Plutôt l’ennui mortel.
Qu'est-ce qui t'amène ?
Je vais à la prison de Jessup
voir un type qui purge une lourde peine.
Il sera peut-être d'humeur causante.
On dirait bien que D'Angelo Barksdale
s'est suicidé.
- Date du décès, le 21-07-03.
- Qui a bossé dessus ?
La police d'État.
Je te ressors le rapport d'autopsie ?
Je veux être sûr
que personne ne l’a suicidé.
Il reste plus
que de la poussière et des briques.
Merde, on a vraiment bataillé
pour les prendre, ces tours.
Tu dis qu'on se retrouve dans la rue,
comme les autres ?
On deale tout ce qu'on peut.
Sans les tours,
tout le monde sait ce qui va se passer.
"Tu vois le genre,
mais pas les mains vides."
Comme si c'était leur jour de chance.
Pas de violence, pas de menaces.
Du genre: "C'est une bonne chose."
Mais on a besoin de bons emplacements,
c'est ça qu'il nous faut.
Être près du centre-ville.
Vendre aux camés à la sortie du boulot.
- Des rues comme Fremont.
- Fayette.
On peut se faire 40000 ou 50000 $
par jour, facilement.
Je marche.
Tout le monde nous observe, mec,
pour voir si on va merder
maintenant qu'il y a plus les tours.
Tu piges ? Lls nous jaugent.
Ils veulent savoir à qui ils ont affaire.
Si un mec nous manque de respect,
on fera ce qu'il faut.
Mais c'est comme ça
que tu t'es retrouvé ici.
Si on peut faire ça sans violence, on fonce.
Surtout qu'on manque de gros bras.
En parlant de ça,
et ce mec que je t'ai envoyé ?
Cutty, ce mec du coin.
Il a appelé, on s'est occupés de lui.
Bien, bien.
- Tu t'es préparé pour l’audience ?
- Tout baigne, mec.
Putain.
Levy s'est occupé de tout pour moi.
Je serai rentré avant l’hiver.
Ça s'est barré en vrille à la cité Franklin.
Et alors ?
Alors, on arrive ici.
Sur mon territoire ? Ça m'étonnerait.
Attends. Tu vas y trouver ton compte.
Ah ouais ? Et comment ?
On peut descendre
jusqu'à 31000 ou 32000 $ .
C'est de la putain de bonne.
Tu peux la couper sept ou huit fois,
ça reste la meilleure sur le marché.
De l’héro. J'ai de l’héro.
Merde !
Vous avez pas vu Marlo ?
Vous l’avez pas vu ?
Vous le connaissez tous, hein ?
Marlo ?
Ouais, il était dans le coin.
Mais plus maintenant.
Qui veut de l’héro ?
De l’héro !
Putain, Tommy. J'étais sur le cul.
Je t'ai vu aux informations
avec Ervin Burrell.
- Tu mijotes quelque chose, enfoiré.
- Je mijote rien du tout.
Je peux l’aider, il peut m'aider.
C'est donnant-donnant.
Tu y gagnes à tous les coups, hein ?
S'il ne marche pas, tu t'en prends à lui
à cause du taux de criminalité élevé.
La presse adore ça, c'est bon pour toi.
Mais s'il marche,
ça te fait un mouchard
dans l’entourage du maire.
Et quel est mon rôle dans tout ça ?
Je pensais que tu pourrais arranger
une rencontre.
Tu sais,
mets ton preux chevalier au courant
à propos de son nouvel ami du conseil.
Et je dois lui dire quoi ?
Sois gentil
ou investis dans de la vaseline ?
C'est son cul, à lui de décider.
- Tu lui as pas parlé ?
- J'ai pas trouvé cet enfoiré.
Ça va chier pour lui.
Là-bas. Au milieu du pâté de maisons.
NOM - POIDS
<i>COTE - VICTOIRE I DÉFAITE</i>
Où est le flingue ?
Attends.
Attends Marlo.
Yo, Cheese. T'étais où ?
Il va en faire de la bouillie.
Va laver ton clébard.
Qui c'est mon pote ? C'est toi ?
Qui c'est mon pote ? Qui c'est mon bébé ?
- Fais gagner du blé à papa, d'accord ?
- Oui.
25 plaques sur mon chien !
Cheese !
Ouais.
Je choisis qui je veux ?
N'importe quelle fille.
Il m'en faut plus d'une.
Il me faut les jumelles Olsen.
Elles sont à toi.
Comme esclaves.
Qui vivent pour satisfaire tes désirs.
Tu vas baiser quel mec en échange ?
Allez, un mec,
vous baiserez qu'une seule fois.
Et dès que j'aurai choisi un mec,
tu vas me dire:
"J'ai su que tu suçais des queues
dès que je t'ai vu.
"Steve McQueen ? C'est ça ton fantasme ?
"T'es qu'un putain d'homosexuel refoulé."
- Steve McQueen ?
- Va te faire foutre. C'est un piège.
Les jumelles Olsen.
Ashley.
- Kate.
- Mary-Kate.
Ouais, j'adore ce qu'elles font.
Elles sont à toi.
T'as juste à choisir un mec.
- Je suis actif, pas passif.
- Ça marche.
Sortez de la fosse.
Lâchez vos chiens.
Ouais ! Allez-y !
Séparez vos chiens.
De la bouillie ?
Merde, le voilà.
Je peux pas choisir une fille
avec un physique de merde ?
<i>Comme la vieille
qui jouait dans Les Craquantes ?</i>
La petite qui portait
des culs de bouteilles ?
Un mec.
- Yo !
- Hein ?
J'ai une question à te poser.
Où est-ce que tu trouves ces casquettes
avec la visière sur le côté ?
J'ai fait tous les magasins
et les seules que j'ai trouvées,
c'est celles qui ont la visière devant.
C'est les mêmes.
Il suffit de la tourner sur votre tête.
Merci.
Encore un abruti qui vient des pavillons,
là-bas.
Les mecs de la cité Franklin arrivent.
Il faut bien qu'ils aillent quelque part.
Je crois pas qu'il y avait besoin de faire ça.
Mon clébard s'est défilé.
Non.
Je crois que tu t'es fait arnaquer.
J'imagine qu'ils viennent
de la cité Franklin,
ils vendent au bord de notre territoire.
Je veux juste savoir
ce que tu veux qu'on fasse d'eux.
Tu veux qu'on fasse quoi ?
Retournez bosser.
D'accord.
Ton gamin m'a fait morfler,
le sale petit con.
Ça a fait la une.
T'avais pas vraiment l’air d'un préfet.
C'est ce que le maire m'a dit.
Ça peut pas se renouveler chaque semaine.
Pas si tu veux que le maire
te confie ce poste.
Tommy est un gars bien, d'habitude.
C'est un pitbull quand il veut un truc.
- Mais c'est plutôt un type bien.
- Je m'en tape de ce qu'il est !
Tu ne peux pas le laisser te cogner dessus.
Fais des concessions.
Il saura te renvoyer l’ascenseur.
D'accord.
Mais je ne ferai rien dans le dos du maire
pour ce type.
On ne peut pas occuper mon poste
en faisant des coups dans le dos du maire.
Excusez-moi du retard.
Mon fils jouait un match de base-ball.
Ça a pris du retard.
Je vous laisse en tête à tête.
Ce que Dieu a uni,
l’homme ne doit point le séparer.
- Il a gagné ?
- Qui ?
Votre fils, son équipe.
Putain, ça intéresse qui ?
C'est un peu mouvementé, mais au moins,
on n'a pas à utiliser la force.
Ces dealers à qui on a affaire,
ils écoutent même pas
les gars de leur bande.
J'irai leur parler.
- Tu en es où ?
- Avec Marlo ?
J'arrive pas à le trouver.
T'as dit de pas chercher la bagarre.
Je me suis installé de l’autre côté de la rue.
Rien que pour ça,
j'ai eu droit à des regards en biais. Je...
Je crois pas que je vais rester.
Et ce Marlo,
tu l’as vraiment cherché ?
Pourquoi t'es pas en train
de chercher ce bâtard ?
Parce que t'as organisé une réunion.
Ferme la porte.
- C'est quoi ta bonne nouvelle ?
- Omar a nettoyé la planque.
Ces enfoirés ont même tiré ma montre.
C'est la seconde planque
qu'ils dévalisent ce mois-ci.
C'est à toi qu'il en veut, Stringer.
Sans vouloir te manquer de respect,
si tu ne l’affrontes pas, ça va continuer.
D'accord. On met deux fois plus d'hommes
dans chaque planque.
Et s'il se pointe, soyez prêts à le recevoir.
Ça n'a rien de personnel.
Je le jure devant Dieu,
ça n'est jamais personnel avec moi.
La vérité, c'est que je siège au conseil
depuis bientôt trois ans.
Et c'est très long quand on est ignoré.
Et à Baltimore,
un Blanc a peu de chances d'être maire.
Je peux devenir magistrat
si une place se libère.
Mais en attendant, je n'ai aucun pouvoir,
sauf celui de faire refaire les routes.
Sans vouloir vous manquer de respect,
vous m'emmerdez
parce que vous vous ennuyez ?
Un peu, oui.
Pourquoi pas ?
En ce qui concerne la criminalité,
cette ville a besoin de toute l’aide possible.
- Il n'y a pas de scandale, ne cherchez pas.
- Il y en a toujours.
Pour le moment, je cherche à savoir
comment nous pourrions nous entendre.
Accordez-moi ce poste
et j'essaierai d'obtenir ce que vous voulez.
Pas d'audiences,
pas de déballages médiatiques.
Et si je ne marche pas,
vous allez me lyncher chaque fois
que je passe devant votre commission ?
- Il me vient une idée.
- Allez-y.
Je n'arrive pas à faire revenir
mes voitures de police de Dickman Street.
Elles ont été envoyées en réparation
il y a des semaines.
Vous l’avez dit au maire ?
- Je ne vous ai rien dit.
- Bien entendu.
- Combien pour ceux-là ?
- 10000 $ les quatre.
Un mec qui met ça sur sa caisse,
c'est comme s'il demandait:
"Foutez-moi en taule."
Sans déconner.
Comment tu vas jouer le coup ?
S'ils viennent de la cité Franklin,
c'est Avon.
- Je sais.
- Et Avon va bientôt sortir de taule.
Si t'es prêt à faire des concessions,
c'est une chose.
Sinon, Avon risque de mal le prendre.
Je sais.
Alors si tu veux défendre ton territoire,
tu ferais mieux d'être prêt.
Tu te souviens de Barksdale ?
Celui qui avait écopé pour tous ?
Tu te souviens de Barksdale ?
Celui qui avait écopé pour tous ?
Il s'est attaché le cou à la poignée
de la bibliothèque de la prison et a attendu.
Je sais pas.
Les Noirs se suicident pas, d'habitude.
Moi, par exemple...
Tu as toutes les raisons de te tuer.
Et pourtant, je suis toujours là.
Faut le dire vite.
- Tu as regardé les photos ?
- Non, il n'y en a pas.
La police a bâclé le travail.
C'est mon tour, Bunk.
Allez. Stratégie numéro trois.
Tu veux mettre ma chanson, chérie ?
- T'as choisi la bonne...
- Bunk.
...tu chanteras l’amour.
- Bunk.
- Je l’ai vue en premier, Jimmy.
- Arrête.
Viens, j'ai un joli appartement à Camden.
Sois sympa, allez.
- Je suis sympa.
- Je suis vraiment pas intéressée.
- Laisse-la.
- On est tous de la même couleur dedans.
Je suis vraiment désolé,
il a un peu trop bu.
Ça va. Merci.
- Tu vas bien ?
- Oui.
- Tu vas pouvoir rentrer ?
- Oui.
Bonne chance.
- Non, le black le plus balaise ?
- C'est qui ?
Un mec de New York,
au début du siècle, Bumpy quelque chose.
- Bumpy ?
- Yo.
Il faisait des trucs du genre se pointer seul
dans un commissariat.
- Non.
- Vous voyez, des trucs comme ça.
Les flics se planquaient:
"Bumpy, on est désolés, on est désolés."
"Sors d'ici, s'il te plaît."
Ouaf !
Trouvez un travail,
évitez de côtoyer des criminels connus,
laissez-nous votre nouvelle adresse
et prévenez-nous si vous en changez.
Si je comprends bien,
vous êtes sans emploi.
Ils cherchent toujours du monde
sur le marché le matin ?
Je sais pas, je m'en fous.
Trouvez un boulot.
- "Ouaf" ?
- "Ouaf", comme un chien.
- Merde, c'était comme...
- C'était Tri, un mec de Cheese.
Vous allez réagir ou quoi ?
- Tu as une meilleure image de la ligature ?
- Oui. À l’intérieur.
Il s'est pendu deux fois ou quoi ?
Il a dû se pencher
jusqu'à ce qu'il perde connaissance
et glisser,
ce qui a causé la marque verticale.
Et si quelqu'un était arrivé par derrière et...
Et puis avait déguisé le meurtre
en suicide ?
- Et les photos du lieu du décès ?
- Ils n'en ont pas pris.
Ils ont vraiment salopé le boulot.
J'ai juste le rapport d'un incompétent.
En plus, je comprends même pas
ce que l’enquêteur a marqué.
- C'est quoi une "grosse ecchy"...
- Une grosse ecchymose, au milieu du dos.
Un bleu.
Au milieu du dos, comme si...
Ou alors il a glissé sous la douche.
Mais peut-être.
Il n'y a rien de mieux qu'un "peut-être".
<i>Tri a fini par coincer ce mec. Il était à pied.</i>
Caroline ?
<i>Cet enfoiré est à la morgue,
mais Tri a du sang plein sa manche.</i>
<i>On dirait une veste à pois.
C’est un truc que tu apprends tout seul.</i>
<i>Tu me suis ?</i>
Meurtre ?
Éclaboussures ?
<i>J’ai dû lui apprendre à se servir du flingue,
il l’a encore.</i>
<i>"Tri, planque cette saloperie chez Neesey.
T’es cinglé ou quoi ?"</i>
<i>Tu sais, ces mecs vont se remuer.</i>
<i>- Alors on s’active aussi.
- Tu passes à quelle heure ?</i>
<i>Putain, mais t’écoutes ou quoi ?</i>
<i>T’es toujours là ?</i>
Fouille !
Temps mort.
- Refais ça.
- Refaire quoi ?
Ce truc avec tes mains. Fais-le devant moi.
Putain, de quoi tu parles...
Hé, mec !
J'ai de la place dans la bagnole.
Les flics se croient tout permis.
J'ai rien fait.
Nique la police !
- Non, on faisait que traîner.
- Dealer, tu veux dire.
Comment ça se passe
pour les mecs en place
avec tous les mecs de la cité Franklin ?
- Je vois pas de quoi vous parlez.
- Fais gaffe à ton cul.
Parce que les dealers ici,
c'est pas des tendres.
Mec, chaque année, tout le monde dit:
"Ces gamins, ils sont d'un genre nouveau.
"J'ai jamais rien vu de pareil.
Le monde va s'écrouler."
Regarde autour de toi, tête de con.
Ça ressemble à une ère nouvelle, hein ?
Je peux y aller ?
Vous voulez peut-être me tabasser avant ?
Fous le camp d'ici.
Ça te va, une branlette ?
Pour une branlette, t'as rien du tout.
Viens.
- Dozerman.
- On dit que la journée est finie ?
<i>Ils sont venus se venger. Daz et sa bande.
Ils ont eu Peanut.</i>
<i>- Et merde, Peanut est mort ?
- Non, il va bien.</i>
<i>Il a repeint le trottoir avec sa cervelle.
Mais il va bien.</i>
<i>Putain, tu crois quoi ?</i>
<i>Merde, il faut que je prévienne Tony.
Je te rappelle.</i>
<i>D’accord.</i>
- Ça en fait déjà deux.
- Mais qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Une guerre de la drogue ?
<i>- Quoi de neuf ?
- Que du vieux, mec.</i>
<i>J’ai pas pioncé depuis que je l’ai buté.</i>
<i>Je ferme les yeux
et je le vois baignant dans son sang.</i>
<i>Cheese, tu as fait le bon choix.</i>
<i>C’est ce que je croyais.</i>
C'est Cheese ?
<i>C’était mon pote. Il m’adorait, en plus.</i>
<i>J’en retrouverai pas un pareil.</i>
<i>- Ils vont me le payer.
- Tu m’étonnes.</i>
Pendant des mois, ces connards
font vachement gaffe au téléphone.
Là, ils parlent de meurtres ?
Hiérarchiquement, Cheese
est juste après Proposition Joe.
Tout à coup, cette affaire prend forme.
<i>- La criminelle.
- Ici Freamon, des affaires spéciales.</i>
<i>- Qui est l’officier de garde ce soir ?
- Norris.</i>
<i>Yo, T. !</i>
<i>On me tire dessus ! On me tire dessus !</i>
<i>Merde, merde !</i>
<i>Ils reviennent !</i>
<i>Bâtard !</i>
<i>C’est qui ?</i>
Mince.
<i>Inspecteur Norris.</i>
Ed, c'est Lester.
<i>T’as des morts dans les quartiers est ?</i>
T'es bien informé.
On t'a donné la cause du décès ?
T'as des infos pour moi
ou tu veux juste prendre des nouvelles ?
<i>Putain, j’ai pas le temps de discuter, moi !</i>
- T'as combien de cadavres, Eddie ?
- "T'en as combien, Eddie ?"
Connard.
- Je vais à la criminelle ?
- J'y vais.
Tu commences tôt demain.
Rentre chez toi. Profite de ton fils.
Je vous le dis,
ce Berman est un putain de magicien.
Regardez bien.
Six arrestations pour vol de voiture,
dont deux stipulent:
"Ll est possible
que la voiture ait été prêtée."
Donc ça fait quatre arrestations,
dont deux inexpliquées.
Et la palme d'or ?
Quatre vols à main armée,
dont deux des plaignants ont dit:
"Trop sombre pour voir l’arme.
"C'était peut-être un peigne."
- Il aurait pu les peigner à mort.
- Oui.
Il réalise des miracles.
Le voilà.
- Abbadabba Berman.
- L’homme qui fait chuter la criminalité.
Je fais juste ce qu'on me demande.
- Quel film magnifique !
- J'ai pas pigé un mot.
Chéri, il faut lire les sous-titres.
Merde, alors !
Vous allez tous au ciné ?
Vous devez être la ravissante Mme Herc ?
Le film vous a plu ?
Oui.
Herc et Carver essaient de nous coincer
tous les jours,
genre: "Où est la came ?
Qui est-ce qui l’a ?"
Mais ils trouvent jamais rien.
Alors vous allez tous au ciné ensemble.
Mince.
Bon, allez, à demain.
Tout va bien ?
À deux.
Décrochez, décrochez.
- Ed, tu dois m'aider.
- Là, je peux pas.
<i>Et un seau rempli de vers de terre.</i>
<i>Oh, mon Dieu !</i>
Bon.
Bon.
Tout va bien ?
Et sa fontanette ?
C'est "fontanelle".
Elle se referme ?
Ça prendra encore du temps.
Super.
<i>- Super ?
- J’en peux plus !</i>
<i>Allez, plus que quelques secondes.</i>
C'était juste pour dire un truc.
<i>J’ai pas pioncé depuis que je l’ai buté.</i>
<i>Je ferme les yeux
et je le vois baignant dans son sang.</i>
- C'est Cheese.
- Sa tête sur un plateau d'argent.
Il ne parle jamais comme ça.
Pourquoi...
Parce que tout vient à point
à qui sait attendre.
- McNulty est au courant ?
- Je vais le tirer du lit.
On continue les écoutes,
on rassemble un maximum d'informations.
Si l’hécatombe continue à l’est,
il faudra arrêter cette écoute.
C'est maintenant que vous venez ?
Après plus d'un an ?
Il ressemble à son père, hein ?
J'ai une question à vous poser.
Après le suicide de D'Angelo,
vous avez pensé quoi ?
Allez, petit. Viens ici.
Oui.
On a eu une information.
Et le rapport d'autopsie la confirme.
Reposez-le, s'il vous plaît.
Bien sûr.
Je suis sincèrement navré.
Ça avait l’air d'un type bien,
au bout du compte.
Alors quand j'ai appris ça,
je me suis dit que je lui devais ça.
Je ne voulais pas vous déranger
sans motif valable.
Alors...
Alors...
Si je peux vous aider,
répondre à vos questions
ou faire quoi que ce soit...

Major, de combien d'hommes
disposez-vous ?
278.
278.
Combien d'arrestations ont été effectuées ?
BALTIMORE
SERVICE STATISTIQUES
Ne vous donnez pas cette peine.
Vous en avez effectué seize.
Seize en un mois.
Sur la même période,
combien d'armes à feu saisies ?
Tous services et secteurs confondus.
Encore une fois,
ne vous donnez pas cette peine. Aucune.
Aucune.
On a eu quatre morts la nuit dernière.
En combien de temps ?
- Fermez ce putain de dossier, répondez.
- En sept heures.
Plutôt en cinq heures.
Parlez-moi de ce gosse.
- Je crois qu'il s'appelle James...
- James Toney.
Quand a-t-il été arrêté
pour la dernière fois ?
En compagnie de qui ?
Où est la came ?
Et ce type ?
Ou celui-là ? Ou celui-là ?
Vous avez quatre meurtres
à deux pâtés de maisons d'intervalle,
et vous n'êtes même pas foutu
de faire le lien.
Vous avez huit heures pour nettoyer
ce merdier ou vous êtes viré. Compris ?
Viré.
Marlo ?
Tu sais que je suis avec Avon ?
Stringer Bell ?
On peut parler ?
Cassez-vous, tes potes et toi.
Jusqu'à maintenant, j'ai été gentil.
Si vous utilisez ce que vous avez,
la machine sera lancée.
On doit se servir des écoutes au tribunal.
- C'est indispensable.
- Elle a raison.
On a enfin quelque chose d'intéressant
et vous voulez arrêter les écoutes ?
Ça ne rime à rien.
C'est la guerre.
On peut avoir quatre autres morts ce soir.
On est à Baltimore, je tablerais sur six.
Aujourd'hui, j'ai vu Marvin Taylor
se faire démonter
parce qu'il n'a pas de piste.
J'y crois pas.
Nos meilleurs lieutenants
parlent de meurtres
et on est incapables de prendre des notes ?
Il y a des morts, Jimmy.
Il faut prendre ça en compte.
Si on a Cheese, on s'approche de Prop Joe,
en s'approchant de Joe,
on s'approche de Stringer.
Ça entre en compte.
J'étais avec vous
quand on a laissé filer Stringer.
Ça me fait chier, moi aussi.
On n'a pas créé cette unité
pour les petits dealers.
Les stupéfiants sont là pour ça.
Nous nous occupons de la violence,
depuis le début.
Barksdale était violent.
Pour le moment, Stringer reste tranquille,
et à l’est, on a des morts.
On a assez d'informations
pour espérer pouvoir arrêter Cheese.
Avec ces affaires de meurtre,
quelqu'un pourrait témoigner
contre Proposition Joe ou Stringer.
Pour les cadavres, quatre, ça fait beaucoup.
On va se servir des écoutes
pour prouver ces meurtres.
<i>- On se prépare.
- Quoi ?</i>
<i>Secoue-toi un peu.</i>
<i>On sait où est Daz.
Viens chez Neesey dans une heure.</i>
<i>Daz est avec elle ?
Je croyais que c’était ta meuf.</i>
Neesey, hein ? C'est bon.
<i>On se rejoint là-bas, on va se battre.</i>
<i>Amène ton flingue, dans une heure.</i>
On s'active.
Caroline, donne la position aux renforts
et reste sur l’écoute.
- On est sur le canal deux.
- D'accord.
Quelle taille, tes frites ?
Quoi ?
Allez-y !
- Police ! On a un mandat !
- Plus un geste !
Les mains en l’air !
Lève les mains ! Allonge-toi !
- On ne bouge plus !
- Allez ! Allez !
Les mains en l’air !
Les mains derrière la tête !
D'accord, Mary Tyler Moore,
complètement nue.
La porte s'ouvre, me voilà,
je laisse tomber ma mallette,
je me penche sur elle,
je la prends en levrette et elle fait:
"Oh, Rob. Oh, Rob."
- Qui est Rob ?
- Le mec de la série.
Terminé.
Mary-Kate and Ashley. Je voudrais pas dire.
Accepte les images
que j'ai à l’esprit en ce moment.
Personne d'autre ?
La copine de Dozerman,
comment elle s'appelle ?
Elle me fait un gâteau. Elle est à poil.
Elle a des taches de farine
partout sur sa peau brune.
J'arrive, j'ai une toque de cuisinier,
je porte rien d'autre,
la bite à l’air et je dis:
"C'est pas comme ça
qu'on mélange la pâte. Je vais t'aider..."
- Salut, Bobby.
- Doze !
- Ça va ?
- Bon, maintenant, on passe au mec.
C'est dur à comprendre pour tout le monde.
Ça n'a rien à voir avec le sexe.
C'est de la solidarité.
- C'est un bol d'air frais pour ce mec.
- D'accord, d'accord.
Gus Triandos.
C'est qui, Gus Triandos ?
Un joueur de base-ball,
receveur chez les Orioles.
Mon frère et moi, on avait sa vignette.
Il avait l’air tellement malheureux.
On aurait dit un gamin que ses parents
auraient abandonné à la gare routière.
Tu sais pourquoi ?
Il devait attraper la balle papillon
de Hoyt Wilhelm.
Pendant cinq ans.
Le pire boulot possible.
Autant essayer d'attraper un cochon volant.
Il a même avoué à un reporter:
"Wilhelm m'a pratiquement détruit."
Gus Triandos. Un grand mec lent.
- Bon choix.
- Vas-y, dis-le.
- Je sais que tu veux le dire.
- Il n'y a rien à dire.
- Rien ?
- Tu as beaucoup réfléchi à ça.
- C'est bien.
- D'accord.
Bon. Pour ce soir, trois choses.
La première,
notez vos incidents dans l’ordre,
sinon demain, ça sera le bordel.
La deuxième,
nous allons photographier chaque preuve
sur place.
N'emballez rien
avant que ça ait été photographié.
Et la troisième, déconnez pas.
Assurez-vous que votre appareil est chargé.
En voiture.
Bon, Cheese, qui est ton pote ?
C'est toi.
Je veux juste savoir qui c'est.
Mon pote.
C'est quoi, un cours de psychologie ?
J'ai compris. S'il vous plaît, arrêtez, arrêtez.
Je vous dirai tout ce que je sais.
Ça va, Cheese.
Qui est ton pote ?
Pas question.
Tu vas pas me coller ces morts sur le dos.
Je veux un avocat.
"C'était mon pote."
"J'ai pas pioncé depuis que je l’ai buté."
"Je ferme les yeux
et je le vois baignant dans son sang."
"Ll m'adorait,
"en plus. J'en retrouverai pas un pareil."
Vous êtes vraiment des enfoirés sans pitié.
On a un enregistrement.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé, Cheese ?
Je croyais qu'il m'avait niqué.
J'ai fait ce qu'il fallait.
Mais encore ?
Je l’ai allumé.
Il se met à table.
Ce qui est fait est fait.
Mais peut-être qu'on peut t'aider.
Comment ? Vous allez le ressusciter ?
On peut t'aider avec les conséquences.
Aide-nous à t'aider.
- Quoi ?
- On peut faire un échange.
Échanger contre quoi ? Contre ça ?
- Putain...
- Contre Proposition Joe.
Donne-nous Prop Joe et on sera cléments
pour ce que t'as fait à ton pote.
Pourquoi je parlerais de Prop Joe...
Et puis merde.
Je connais même pas de Prop Joe.
Bon. Et ton pote ?
C'est lequel ? Où est le cadavre ?
Là où je l’ai laissé, j'imagine.
- Dans un entrepôt des quartiers est.
- Il y est toujours ?
Oui, je crois.
À moins que la S.P.A. Soit passée par là.
Quoi ?
On dirait qu'il crache le morceau.
Je dois admettre
que vous m'avez impressionné.
Que puis-je ajouter ?
Je vous dois une fière chandelle, Cédric.
Ça t'arrive souvent,
des journées où tout te réussit ?
Aujourd'hui, ça pourrait en être une
pour moi.
Annoncez-moi une bonne nouvelle.
On l’inculpe.
Dépôt illégal d'un cadavre d'animal.
Usage d'arme à feu en agglomération.
Cruauté envers un animal,
si on veut se lâcher.
Vas-y, traite-moi de suceur de bite.
- Tu sais que tu en as envie.
- Pardon ?
J'ai jeté un œil aux statistiques
de Gus Triandos.
Il savait se servir de sa batte.
Allez vous faire foutre.
À plus, mon pote.
Va te faire mettre.
- Bonsoir, Bunk.
- Bonsoir.
Drôle de journée.
C'est moi qui suis chargé
de faire stopper la guerre de la drogue.
Mais j'ai grillé mon écoute
pour un chien mort.
Tu te rappelles comment tu as dit
que tu espérais que ça serait
"une journée où tout te réussit’ ?
Et alors ?
Bien, messieurs.
Si les feux stop s'allument deux fois,
c'est qu'ils ont fait un deal.
En arrivant ce matin,
j'ai trois messages sur mon répondeur
venant de Buddy Ferraro,
des travaux publics.
Les messages assurent que 20 voitures
seront bonnes pour le service
en fin de semaine.
Buddy et mon père sont de vieux amis.
Ils ont fait
leur première communion ensemble.
Bien, de quoi d'autre avez-vous besoin ?
Et vous n'en avez pas parlé au maire ?
Vous avez eu vos voitures ?
Quelqu'un s'est fait baiser ?
Votre boulot est devenu plus facile ?
À ma connaissance, j'ai 70 flics
qui partent en retraite à la fin de l’année,
et il n'y a pas d'argent
pour former la relève.
Le maire vous a entubé,
je sais que cet argent était au budget.
Le maire a retardé l’échéance
à l’été prochain.
Moins d'agents, moins de salaire,
moins d'indemnités.
Un report de six mois permet à la ville
d'économiser deux ou trois millions.
J'en parlerai autour de moi.
Oui ?
<i>- Major Colvin ?
- Oui.</i>
<i>Ici le Central.</i>
<i>Désolé de vous l’apprendre,
mais un de vos hommes a été blessé.</i>
Dans quel hôpital est-il ?
Je viens d'emménager, alors...
Putain ! J'aurais pas dû le laisser seul.
J'aurais dû lui donner un coéquipier.
On aura la peau de l’enfoiré qui a fait ça.
Si on le chope, il en ressortira pas vivant.
Hein ?
Jugulaire perforée, mâchoire brisée.
Il va s'en tirer.
Donne-m'en une.
Je ressors juste du service de réanimation.
Vous lui avez sauvé la vie
en l’amenant si vite à l’hôpital.
Description du suspect ?
Un homme, qui porte un t-shirt blanc,
un jean large et des baskets.
Il s'est échappé,
mais le secteur est verrouillé.
C'est quoi, cette histoire de flingue ?
Doze a voulu riposter,
il a fait tomber son flingue.
Un connard l’a ramassé et s'est enfui.
J'arrive toujours pas à y croire.
- Je la prends.
- Non.
Non, non, non.
Ça sera plus joli quand j'aurai tout arrangé.
Cédric, ça m'est égal.
Dis-lui que je suis crevé.
Je ressors juste de l’hôpital, je rentre.
<i>Il demandait
si vous pourriez parler à la presse.</i>
Il veut pas que je leur parle maintenant.
<i>- D’accord.
- Ça serait déraisonnable.</i>
<i>- D’accord, je lui dirai.
- Bien.</i>
Bunny, vous avez une tête de déterré.
Vous m'offrez un café ?
Vous savez ce que je me disais ?
Que c'était une bonne nuit.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que le blessé n'est pas mort.
Et ça m'a frappé.
C'est ça une bonne nuit
quand je suis de garde.
L’absence de négatif.
C'était une bonne nuit.
Voilà le topo.
Dans six mois, je pars à la retraite.
J'ai travaillé 30 ans ici
et tout ce qui restera de moi,
ça sera un portrait dans le couloir ouest.
Mais vous savez quoi ?
Toute ce bordel dans les rues.
Cette ville est pire que quand j'ai débuté.
Je dois en conclure quoi ?
Sur ma vie ?
Arrêtez. Il s'agit de drogue.
C'est une force de la nature.
Qui on est, ça n'a pas d'importance.
La cause était juste.
Pas un appel depuis que Cheese sait
qu'il est sur écoute.
Tu t'attendais à quoi ?
Levez-vous.
Asseyez-vous.
En ce qui concerne l’agent Dozerman,
son état s'est amélioré,
il est sous surveillance.
Il a quitté le service de réanimation
et peut recevoir des visites.
À partir de ce service,
les arrestations concernant
la vente de substances illicites
sont suspendues dans le district ouest.
Vous plaisantez.
À une époque,
ça semble remonter à la nuit des temps,
le district a fait face à un dilemme déchirant
de grande envergure.
Le conseil municipal avait passé une loi
interdisant la consommation d'alcool
dans les lieux publics, les rues
et les carrefours.
Mais la rue a été, est et sera toujours
le salon du pauvre.
C'est là que veut être un homme
par une chaude nuit d'été.
C'est moins cher que dans un bar,
l’air est frais et on regarde passer les filles.
Mais la loi est la loi.
Et les flics en patrouille,
qu'allaient-ils faire ?
S'ils arrêtaient chaque type
qui sirote une bière dehors,
ils n'auraient plus le temps
de rien faire d'autre.
Et s'ils faisaient semblant de ne rien voir ?
Lls seraient devenus sujets à la critique.
À toutes sortes de manque de respect.
Cela s'est déroulé avant que je débute,
dans les années 50 ou 60,
il y eut un moment de pur génie.
Un poivrot anonyme, sortant d'un magasin
après avoir acheté de l’alcool,
en allant s'installer à un carrefour,
a glissé sa bouteille d'alcool
dans un sac en papier.
Un grand moment de compromis civique.
Ce petit sac de papier froissé
a permis aux gens
de boire tranquillement dans les rues,
et il nous a offert la possibilité
de faire notre travail de policier.
Le genre de travail qui en vaut la peine.
Le genre de travail qui vaut la peine
qu'on se fasse tirer dessus.
Dozerman
s'est fait tirer dessus en essayant d'acheter
trois doses.
Trois !
Il n'y a jamais eu de sac en papier
pour la drogue.
Jusqu'à maintenant.
Si on s'occupe pas du trafic dans les rues,
on fait quoi ?
Ces conneries
à propos des sacs en papier ?
Ça veut dire quoi ?

Au pire, ils peuvent te rétrograder

Je préfère pas penser

Toi aussi.

"Les dieux ne te sauveront pas." - Burrell
Et moi, je lui dis: "Mon frère, si tu veux
me vendre une nouvelle caisse,
"t'as vraiment intérêt à me la vendre.
"Sinon, je mate
et je bouge pas d'un pouce."
T'as besoin d'une nouvelle caisse ?
Tu peux en trouver une quand tu veux,
où tu veux, ici.
- Je disais ça comme ça.
- Quoi ?
- C'est au cas où.
- Au cas où quoi ?
Au cas où je voudrais acheter une caisse.
- C'est trop demander ?
- T'es dingue, ma pauvre.
Putain, vite, baissez-vous.
- Ils ont compris.
- Ils le protègent de près.
T'as vu ce que tu voulais voir ?
Ouais, mais tout le deuxième étage
est barricadé.
Y a un petit porche à l’arrière.
Y a des mecs qui y fument des Menthol.
On passe par l’arrière, alors ?
- C'est aussi bloqué.
- Devant, c'est pas possible ?
Pas pour l’instant. Mais demain matin,
y aura plus qu'une patrouille réduite
à trois mecs. Tu vois ?
Ça me plaît pas trop.
Pourquoi on s'en prend toujours
au gang de Barksdale ?
C'est pas comme si cette ville manquait
de planques à came.
C'est pas faux.
Alors pourquoi ?
Parce que.
Parce que ?
Oui.
C'est ça un tueur de flics ?
Oui, ça n'a rien d'extraordinaire.
L’agression de Dozerman, c'était lui.
Il a tout avoué.
Avant ou après
que tu lui casses la gueule ?
"Les blessures ont été infligées
tandis que la patrouille
"poursuivait et arrêtait
les suspects susmentionnés."
- On l’a arrêté dans le district est ?
- Oui.
Mais le fourgon s'est arrêté
dans le district ouest
pour une petite révision imprévue.
On n'y voit rien, là-bas.
<i>La patrouille de l’ouest l’a pris
pour une piñata.</i>
T'en penses quoi ?
Que c'est une putain d'erreur judiciaire.
Ça mériterait de passer
devant un jury d'accusation,
ou alors le Président devrait nommer
un procureur indépendant.
Non.
Je crois que Kofi Bryant
et l’ONU de mes deux
devraient être alertés.
- C'est un meurtre.
- Là-haut,
ils veulent moins de meurtres,
pas davantage.
C'est le comté d'Anne Arundel.
Ils devraient s'en foutre.
Et toi aussi.
Salut, Bunk. Ça va ?
Le shérif veut savoir
si on a récupéré l’arme de Dozerman.
Non. Le gosse l’aurait vendue dans la rue.
Il a juste donné le pseudo de l’acheteur.
Un certain Peanut, introuvable.
- Ils veulent récupérer son arme.
- Pardon ?
Pas d'arme de service dans la rue.
Par principe.
Parole de grand chef.
L’affaire n'est pas classée
tant que l’arme n'a pas été retrouvée.
Non, non, te lève pas.
C'est l’une des villes les plus armées
de la planète,
pourquoi ces crétins s'inquiètent
pour une pauvre arme semi-automatique ?
Pourquoi tu m'as fait venir
par ce temps dégueulasse ?
La police aime pas la pluie.
Vas-y, parle.
C'était pour te dire que Cheese
s'était fait interroger par les keufs.
- Il l’a bouclée ?
- Pas de doute.
Il a pas ouvert la bouche
et les a fait poireauter.
Apparemment, c'est eux qui ont merdé.
Pourquoi ?
La police a insinué
que Cheese avait été enregistré.
Ils voulaient l’inculper.
Ils ont dit qu'ils avaient tout entendu.
- Qui s'est fait tuer ?
- Un clebs.
- Quel genre ?
- Le genre caniche en chaleur.
Ils avaient mis les téléphones sur écoute ?
Moi, je m'en fous.
Moi et mes gars,
on se dit rien au téléphone.
Et toi, String ?
Alors tout va bien.
Le seul truc,
c'est qu'ils nous ont encore à l’œil.
Tu sais ce qui tue encore plus de flics
que les balles et l’alcool ?
L’ennui. Ils détestent ça.
Faut que ça reste ennuyeux, String.
Fais-les crever d'ennui.
Tu parles sérieusement ?
Oui.
Quelle est l’école la plus proche d'ici ?
École primaire Stuart Hill.
C'est à au moins huit rues.
- Trois sept.
- Trois sept ?
Cinq huit.
Tu bluffes, fais voir.
Cinq huit. Regarde-les et pleure.
Tu triches.
- J'arrive pas à te coincer, c'est tout.
- C'est de la chance, Tony.
Oui, c'est ça.
- Tu me cherchais ?
- Oui. Entre. Prends-toi une chaise.
Fais gaffe à ton portefeuille.
Fais vite, Tommy.
Ils veulent un gros article sur la réforme
du conseil des vins et spiritueux.
- Ils vont le réformer ?
- Oui, avec une grenade.
Je t'écoute.
Ça reste entre nous ?
Y aura pas de promotion de cadets
dans la police cette année.
Ordre du maire.
Le taux d'homicides et de crimes grimpe
en flèche, il nous manque des patrouilles.
Sans parler des départs à la retraite.
C'est un ordre du maire ? Dans quel but ?
Faire des économies.
Ils ont le budget,
mais en attendant 6 mois,
ils économisent 2 millions.
Crois-tu qu'il y a une déclaration signée
par le maire ?
Non, mais le bureau du personnel
te confirmera que la formation
est repoussée de dix mois.
Fais ce que tu peux et reviens me briefer.
- Tu veux t'impliquer ?
- Non. J'aime trop le maire.
Merci, monsieur le conseiller.
- Tu remues la merde ?
- Juste un peu.
Pour le bien de notre belle ville sur la baie.
Trois deux.
Les services de logement avaient demandé
sa démolition, non ?
Lls manquent d'argent pour le faire.
Tu es sûr que c'est une bonne idée
d'en parler à personne ?
L’ignorance est salvatrice, lieutenant.
On ne vous l’a jamais dit ?
Si, et j'ai cassé la gueule au mec.
Vous avez vu McNulty ?
Mettez-le au parfum quand il arrive.
Nouvelle cible.
Kintel Williamson, se fait appeler Prince K.
Deale à plusieurs carrefours
de Park Circle à Woodland Avenue.
Il descend aussi des types.
Trois ces quatre derniers mois.
C'est ce qu'affirment nos amis
du district nord-ouest.
On laisse tomber Proposition Joe ?
On transfère toutes les arrestations
au bureau de la crim.
On laisse les stups s'en occuper.
Nous, on passe à autre chose.
- Il a pas l’air méchant.
- C'est un tueur.
Tout le monde veut voir
le taux d'homicides baisser,
notre unité doit s'en occuper.
- Bell aussi est un meurtrier.
- Pas ces derniers temps.
Prop Joe se tient tranquille aussi.
Ils écoulent encore de la came.
Ils font bosser des gosses.
Comme on s'est fait griller
à cause d'un putain de clebs,
on leur fout la paix, on les laisse continuer
comme si on n'avait jamais représenté
de menace réelle ?
Je veux qu'on établisse une stratégie
d'ici ce week-end.
L’esprit de McNulty est avec nous.
Quoi ?
Là.
Ça marchera aussi.
Quelques-unes sont occupées
dans la section des 200 et celle-ci.
Mais sinon,
c'est tout.
C'est de la bonne, hein ?
Allons-y.
<i>- Le préfet Burrell.
- Qui le demande ?</i>
<i>- Le conseiller Carcetti.
- Ne quittez pas.</i>
<i>- Allô.
- Erv, je vous préviens.</i>
<i>Un reporter du Sun va vous appeler</i>
<i>- au sujet de la promotion.
- C’est une blague ?</i>
Calmez-vous.
Dites-lui que vous n'avez rien à dire.
<i>Vous me dites
que mon nom n’apparaîtra pas</i>
<i>- et vous me mettez un reporter au cul ?
- Exact.</i>
Et appelez le maire vous-même et dites-lui
qu'un reporter pose des questions
au sujet de l’école de police.
Vous direz que vous savez pas qui a parlé.
<i>Je savais que ça allait me revenir
en pleine gueule.</i>
<i>- Ça ira, vous êtes couvert.
- Merde,</i>
<i>vous m’exposerez pas comme ça
devant le maire.</i>
<i>- J’ai le cul à l’air et...
- Vous voulez cette formation ?</i>
<i>- Faites-moi confiance.
- Merde !</i>
Comment tu m'as retrouvée ?
- J'ai vu Lucas.
- Me parle plus de lui.
Ce mec me doit encore de l’argent.
Il m'a juste dit où je pouvais te trouver.
Il t'a dit comment j'allais ?
Oui...
Je sais ce que tu penses.
T'as pas l’air en forme non plus.
Tu m'as l’air d'aller bien.
J'essaie juste de trouver ta sœur.
T'es pas assez bien pour elle.
Nous non plus, d'ailleurs.
Elle est partie à Baltimore County.
Elle a changé de fringues, de caisse,
elle se la joue hautaine
avec les blacks de la ville comme nous.
Elle est prof.
- Où ça ?
- On n'est pas aux pièces, putain.
Je sais que t'as envie de te barrer,
de sentir le propre, de te ranger.
Elle donne des cours de diction.
Pour que tous les blacks parlent
comme Condoleezza.
À Ida B. Wells.
Excusez-moi, monsieur.
Vous avez vu cette petite fille ?
C'est ma petite.
Vous pouvez garder la photo ?
Merci beaucoup. Dieu vous garde.
- Vous avez vu cette fillette ?
- Vous pouvez pas rester.
C'est ma petite. Elle a que quatre ans.
Je l’ai pas vue. Restez pas ici.
- Regardez-la, s'il vous plaît !
- Je l’ai pas vue...
Ça gaze ?
Allez.
Alors, elle est où ?
Là-bas.
Alors, tu te fous de moi ?
Du calme, mon frère.
Passe-moi le tournevis et calme-toi, putain.
Allez ! On y va !
On dégage !
Yo, Tosha, vas-y !
- Dante, vas-y, je te couvre.
- Allez, Dante.
C'est bon, je te couvre.
Allez !
Vas-y, Dante !
Vous êtes prêts ?
C'est parti.
Allez, on y va !
Monte dans la voiture, Kimmy. Allez.
Votre service est une vraie passoire.
Ça pourrait être quelqu'un de la mairie.
Un de vos employés.
- Quelqu'un du conseil.
- Peu importe.
Il faut qu'on arrange ça,
du coup,
va falloir prendre ça sur vous, Erv.
- Moi ?
- Oui.
Dites au journal que la formation
a été repoussée pour une bonne raison.
Manque de recrues,
problèmes de personnel.
N'impliquez pas la mairie.
Ensuite, le maire interviendra
pour annoncer que la formation aura lieu
en janvier, quoi qu'il arrive.
Dans un jour, ce sera oublié.
Monsieur le maire,
c'était une question de budget.
On m'a demandé de décaler la formation.
Vous avez été mis en cause
et vous l’êtes à nouveau.
Et je vous en remercie.
Quatre-vingt-neuf ?
Ça, c'est que pour ceux du côté ouest.
Mec, il nous faut un résultat plus précis.
Démerde-toi avec tous ces Peanut.
Putain, tu me prends pour Snoopy ?
Merde.
Ces connards me font ratisser la ville
à la recherche d'une arme à la con !
<i>- Brigade criminelle.
- Deux morts. Entre Pall Mall et Pimlico.</i>
Pall Mall et Pimlico. Entendu.
On a deux morts.
C'est le tour de Ray Cole.
Cole est au tribunal et je me suis chargé
de l’agression au couteau à Cherry Hill.
Compte pas sur moi.
Je fouille une botte de foin
pour retrouver l’arme de Dozerman.
Tu veux que je rempile
comme un vulgaire débutant ?
C'est vraiment dégueulasse, Bunk.
CRIMES - DÉLITS
Agression qualifiée à la matraque ? Non.
Mets ça avec les délits.
Ça aussi. Braquage.
Un simple braquage n'est pas un crime.
Un vol. Un crétin a noté ça
comme une effraction en plein jour ?
Fait chier.
Faites ça bien.
Ne laissez rien passer, n'atténuez rien.
Ils veulent la vérité.
Et le service Statistiques ?
Lls vous abattront.
Je suis à cinq mois de la retraite, non ?
Tant pis
s'ils n'apprécient pas la plaisanterie.
Le major a sûrement des explications
ou une excuse à offrir
pour ces statistiques hebdomadaires
sur le crime qui sont à l’opposé
de celles des huit autres districts.
Non, je n'en ai pas.
Vous êtes satisfait ?
Non, je ne suis pas content.
J'aimerais qu'on ait plus d'impact.
Mais vu ce qu'on fait,
c'est sûr qu'on n'en a pas.
Colvin, j'ai l’impression que la criminalité
est en baisse dans le district ouest.
Peut-être vous êtes-vous embrouillé
dans vos statistiques.
Non. Nous avons été très méticuleux.
Parfois, les dieux refusent de coopérer.
De coopérer ?
C'est un effort collectif,
on travaille tous main dans la main.
Dans le district est,
le lieutenant Daniels a illustré
ce nouvel état d'esprit l’autre jour.
Grâce à ça, on a résolu
deux affaires de meurtre
et il y a beaucoup moins de cadavres
dans les rues
depuis qu'on lutte contre la came.
Le maire me fait porter le chapeau
pour la formation.
- Tu me fais marcher ?
- Il n'y a plus de loyauté.
Mais dans le district est,
que me réserve un major pourtant vétéran ?
Vous nous faites marcher, hein ?
Vous cachez les véritables chiffres
et projections.
Quelqu'un va venir
nous les apporter, c'est ça ?
Une strip-teaseuse, peut-être ?
Ce serait sympa.
Entre un bout de nichon
et un aperçu de sa chatte,
elle balancerait les statistiques
prouvant la baisse de la criminalité
comme on l’a promis au maire.
Ce serait magnifique.
La cerise sur le gâteau.
Et vous qui dites des conneries du style:
"Dommage qu'on s'en sorte pas mieux",
censées convaincre une fillette de six ans
que vous faites votre boulot.
Mais elle est plus là, major Colvin.
Là, elle demande à la strip-teaseuse
si plus tard,
elle pourra faire comme elle,
parce que votre boulot, elle le trouve nul.
Et vous savez pourquoi ?
Parce qu'il n'y aura plus de district ouest
dans 20 ans
si ça continue comme ça.
Je me fiche que vous soyez
un vieux de la vieille,
si la criminalité ne chute pas,
c'est vous qui tomberez.
Si les dieux vous emmerdent,
trouvez le moyen de leur rendre la pareille.
On est à Baltimore,
les dieux ne peuvent rien pour vous.
Je suis avec personne. Je le ferai pas.
Allez. On est du même gang.
Donne-moi ça.
Elle faisait partie des tireurs ?
C'était une passante ?
Viens, on y va
Elle a été prise en plein milieu de tout ça.
- Allez, à moi de faire Omar.
- Non, c'est à moi.
Je te le dis, j'étais là.
Y avait un blanc-bec au club 909
Apex était à côté de lui,
il a transformé le type en passoire.
Putain, je mens pas.
Dès que le 9 mm a fermé sa gueule,
le blanc-bec a regardé Apex et a dit:
"C'est tout ce que t'as ?"
Ce que je veux dire,
c'est qu'un type qui a autant de sang blanc,
c'est forcément un con.
- Tu voulais me parler ?
- Tes chiffres sont pas bons, Fruit.
C'est les gars de Barksdale.
Ils interceptent la dope sur Fremont.
Quand j'avais une boutique
et que mes ventes étaient pas bonnes,
je me bougeais.
- Je sais.
- Débarrasse-toi d'eux.
Prends les jeunes avec toi,
ça les entraînera.
D'accord.
Alors lieutenant, le shérif vous a félicité ?
Ça m'a coûté ma mise sur écoute.
Mais vous avez fait du bon boulot à l’est.
Vous avez éradiqué la guerre des gangs.
Il va aussi régler mon problème
à Park Heights.
Il faut qu'on s'occupe de Kintel Williamson.
Rawls m'a promis que j'aurais Daniels
et son équipe pendant un mois.
Vous vous taillez une sacrée réputation.
Stan, t'as un plan pour le district sud-est ?
Comment tu vas améliorer les chiffres ?
Je sais pas.
Je vais poster des équipes aux carrefours,
des patrouilles à pied à la cité Perkins,
faire des heures sup.
Et si ça marche pas,
je falsifierai les chiffres.
Et toi ?
Je vais poster des équipes
toutes les 12 heures pendant le week-end.
Et toi, Bunny ?
J'en sais rien.
Je pensais peut-être légaliser la drogue.
Ils sont arrivés. On leur a tiré dessus.
Le putain d'enculé avec son gros flingue ?
- On a essayé de le coincer, mais...
- Je crois que je l’ai eu.
- T'as touché personne.
- Moi, je l’ai peut-être eu.
String, on a touché une nana.
Mais après, j'ai vu personne tomber.
- Sauf Tank.
- Ouais, Tank est tombé.
L’autre nana l’a eu.
Comme ça, on est quittes.
- T'en as eu une, alors ?
- Ouais.
C'est bien.
Comme une journée un peu fraîche.
Un jour un peu frais, y a rien à en dire.
Quand on atteint les 10 degrés,
on commence à être content.
Quand il fait 16 degrés,
les blacks commencent à cuire.
Si ça tombe en-dessous de zéro,
ça commence à râler.
Ils se les gèlent.
Mais un jour un peu frais ?
Tout le monde s'en fout.
Personne s'en souvient et vous,
vous me donnez trop de jours un peu frais.
C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
On va tous aller
à l’enterrement de cette meuf.
Faut pas quitter ce connard
tant que la salope est pas sous terre.
Et si ce pédé s'amène
pour lui rendre hommage,
il va nous entendre.
Avec qui tu parles, putain ?
Donette. Elle m'a appelé.
Non, tu raccroches.
- Vous avez pigé ?
- Ouais.
- Ouais.
- Ouais.
S'il s'amène, on lui fait sa fête...
comme par une journée un peu fraîche.
ÉCOLE PRIMAIRE IDA B. WELLS
De manière générale,
la criminalité est en baisse.
Mais le taux d'homicides est encore élevé.
Quel est le plan ?
Des heures sup mieux payées
pour les homicides et les affaires locales.
Il faut graisser la patte
si on veut résoudre les affaires.
C'est d'accord.
Si on avait des renforts au tribunal,
ça ferait une grande différence.
Si vous voulez vous en sortir,
ne comptez pas sur moi.
Les dossiers qu'on vous envoie
n'aboutissent jamais.
On a peu d'éléments.
Souvent à peine de quoi aller
à l’audience préliminaire.
Si vos hommes n'étaient pas aussi obsédés
par leur taux de condamnations,
ils règleraient quelques affaires.
Bon sang...
Faites au moins semblant
d'être du même camp.
Stephen, on a tous les deux envie
de se faire élire, cette année.
Faites quelque chose pour nous.
Si vous voulez continuer à bosser
après le mandat de Walker,
montrez-moi que vous êtes concerné.
Aucun d'entre nous n'a envie
de trouver un vrai boulot.
- Monsieur le maire.
- Très bien.
- Au rapport dans une semaine.
- Merci.
De vrais gosses.
Demper a toujours bâclé son boulot.
Oui, mais il a été élu,
donc on est coincés avec lui.
Et Burrell !
La criminalité, c'est votre point faible.
Il faut que vous vous débarrassiez
du bois mort.
- Burrell a des amis.
- Les ministres ?
Il est peut-être leur homme,
mais vous aussi.
Virez Burrell, faites venir du sang frais
et la criminalité baisse, d'accord ?
Les ministres s'en contenteront.
Vous voulez vous débarrasser
du bois mort ?
Dans le 11e district aussi, apparemment.
Monsieur le maire, Eunetta doit partir.
Elle a fait son temps.
Le conseil a besoin de meilleurs éléments.
Elle fait partie de mon équipe, Odell.
Tout comme le chef de la police.
La loyauté, c'est important, non ?
Bunky Bunk, où est-il ?
C'est Cole qui s'en charge, pas toi.
Toi, tu t'occupes de l’arme de Dozerman.
Cole était au tribunal. J'y peux rien.
Rawls et Foerster me mettront la pression
tant que t'auras pas retrouvé l’arme.
J'aimerais beaucoup
pouvoir desserrer les fesses
si ça ne te dérange pas, et respirer un peu.
Je viens de découvrir un truc
qui est une vraie priorité.
- C'est une victime. Bien réelle.
- Vas-y.
Deuxième victime d'un double homicide.
Une nana de 20 ans prise dans des tirs.
Elle a pris une balle dans la tête.
Mais elle est morte dans un quartier
dont tout le monde se fout.
Tu me dois quand même
une arme de service.
Trouve-moi ce flingue de mes deux.
Police de Baltimore
DOSSIER ARME
Merde.
Kintel Williamson, c'est qui ?
- Il deale à Park Heights.
- Comme tout le monde.
On t'a appelé toute la journée,
on se demandait où t'étais.
Kima, tu peux peut-être nous renseigner.
Comptez pas sur moi.
Mon coéquipier me dit pas
ce qu'il trafique en ce moment.
- J'étais à la bibliothèque.
- C'est ça.
Celle de la prison de Jessup.
D'Angelo Barksdale ne s'est pas suicidé.
- Le légiste te l’a dit ?
- Il a pas eu besoin.
Physiquement, ça correspondait pas.
Hé ! J'aime pas plus que toi
l’idée de lâcher Stringer ou Prop Joe.
Mais là, c'est un peu mince.
On a mis la pression à Cédric
pour que les homicides baissent.
En attendant, Stringer Bell,
c'est l’affaire des stups.
Il t'a retiré de l’affaire, Jimmy.
S'il veut remanier son unité
pour coincer la cible de son choix,
ça ne regarde que lui.
Lester, je te croyais perfectionniste.
Quand ça vaut le coup.
Faut que je vous parle.
C'est de ma faute.
Vous entendez ?
Je suis vraiment désolé.
Ça m'aide pas.
C'est vraiment bizarre...
Ils savent qu'on est de la police
dès le départ.
Ils le savent aussi
quand on emménage ensemble,
ils le savent toujours
quand on décide de fonder une famille,
ils font avec jusqu'au jour où ils craquent.
Un jour, c'est:
"Trouve-toi un boulot normal
"où tu rentres à 17 h."
- "Appelle-moi plus souvent."
- Exactement.
"Arrête de te faire des serveuses."
Je veux aller voir le district ouest, demain.
Pour voir comment ça se passe
depuis que les tours sont plus là.
On est censés
commencer à bosser sur Kintel.
Qu'il aille se faire foutre.
- Ça peut attendre un jour ou deux.
- D'accord.
On s'en fout.
Quand tu sillonnais le district ouest,
c'était ton coin ?
Ouais.
J'allais aussi sur Winchester, sous le pont.
Tu devais pas rentrer chez toi
tous les soirs.
- Me dis pas que je suis aussi une salope.
- Va te faire foutre.
Putain !
Je commence à ressembler à McNulty.
Bon, je vais y aller.
Non, mamie, je peux pas.
Faut que tu aies l’air à ton avantage.
Que ce soit physiquement
ou matériellement. Allez, file.
- Promets-moi de manger, d'accord ?
- Allez, sauve-toi.
- Tu les connais ?
- Pas du tout.
Ils me disent quelque chose.
Des vieux de la vieille.
Pas beaucoup.
On se barre un an et ça n'a plus rien à voir.
C'est plutôt calme.
Barksdale perd les tours
et il arrive à se développer sans pertes ?
Je me demande comment ça se passe
dans le district ouest.
Ouais. Salut, Jay.
<i>- T’as une minute ?
- Oui.</i>
<i>- Comment ?
- Il s’est effondré.</i>
Quand ?
Comment va-t-il ?
Merde.
<i>- Tu me tiens au courant ?
- Oui.</i>
D'accord.
Merci.
- Tu connais Ray Cole ?
- De la crim.
Il est tombé au club de gym ce matin.
- Sur un tapis de course.
- Comment va-t-il ?
Un tapis de course.
Poot, regarde.
- Ils veulent quoi ?
- Je sais pas.
Putain ! Barrez-vous !
Barre-toi ! Fais gaffe !
Allez, on se taille.
T'as entendu ? On se barre.
Je lui faisais sa fête.
Mais ouais, t'es un dur.
Allez, on se casse.
"Le préfet a confirmé
qu'un budget avait été alloué
"à la formation des policiers,
"mais déclaré
que le département attendait le vote
"d'une subvention fédérale
avant de programmer la formation."
Burrell maîtrise bien la langue de bois.
La patrouille revient.
- Salut, Kima.
- Salut, Ellis.
Herc.
Qu'est-ce qui nous vaut l’honneur...
On voulait voir ce qui avait changé
depuis le départ des tours.
On a vu des types de Barksdale, mais
personne ne semble s'en prendre à eux.
C'est nouveau, cette fraternité ?
On a la situation en main.
Ils savent qu'on n'est pas leurs amis
et qu'on leur fera pas de cadeau
s'ils mouftent.
Et vos indics, ils en pensent quoi ?
Au diable les indics. On n'en a pas besoin.
On les met au parfum, on les bastonne,
on les arrête.
C'est notre manière de faire.
Sergent, on vous attend
pour une réunion des supérieurs.
Il faut que j'y aille.
Tu te rappelles ce que je t'ai dit ?
La police a besoin d'indics, de bons.
Ouais, on n'est plus au centre.
Ici, c'est le front.
Si tu veux des infos, tu te trouves ton indic
et tu lui parles.
Vous êtes en retard.
Des inspecteurs du centre-ville sont là.
Ils avaient besoin de conseils.
Je vous fais un résumé.
La nouvelle stratégie pour le district,
c'est de déplacer tous les trafics de rue
vers ces trois zones.
- On veut être efficaces.
- Comment ça ?
Si ça se fait pas en douceur,
ça se fera à la dure.
Faut faire passer le message à ces crétins:
S'ils vont dans ces zones,
loin des quartiers résidentiels,
des zones commerciales, des écoles,
s'ils quittent ces quartiers,
ils pourront dealer tranquillement,
sans qu'on intervienne.
Politique de non-intervention
dans le district ouest
- à l’avenir.
- N'importe quoi.
- C'est hors de question.
- Attendez.
Vous voulez qu'on leur laisse la voie libre ?
- Comment rester crédibles ?
- Ouais.
Ils nous riront au nez, leurs gosses aussi.
Le major n'a pas terminé.
Il faut essayer d'avoir une vision
à long terme.
Une fois que...
Une fois qu'ils seront à l’aise,
qu'ils se seront familiarisés avec les lieux,
une fois qu'ils auront pris leurs marques,
qu'ils seront détendus,
et qu'ils auront baissé leur garde,
on interviendra.
Et après, on fait notre travail de flic.
Posez-vous la question.
Vous préférez
tirer sur des poissons dans l’océan
ou les rassembler dans des filets
et vider vos armes à ce moment-là ?
Sans parler du fait
qu'il faudra s'occuper des connards
qui refusent de bouger.
C'est pas si mal.
Ralentis.
Allez.
C'est ta caisse ?
- Pas mal.
- Tu dois avoir une Lexus.
Non. J'ai une carte de bus.
T'as raccroché ?
Je suis paysagiste, en ce moment,
j'essaie d'y voir plus clair.
- Comment s'appelle ton fils ?
- Allen.
- Comme le joueur de base-ball ?
- Comme son père.
Quoi ?
J'essaie de t'imaginer tondant une pelouse.
C'est sûr que je suis pas habillé comme ça.
- Mais ça te va bien.
- Toi aussi, t'es pas mal.
Le service des loisirs a mis
pas mal de monde à la retraite.
Je pourrais peut-être essayer
de te faire rencontrer quelqu'un.
Un homme de ma paroisse
se charge de pourvoir ces postes.
Ce serait vraiment... Merci.
Écris-moi ton numéro ici.
Il t'appellera.
Il faut que j'y aille.
Ça m'a fait plaisir de te voir.
Grace.
Quand je te regarde...
Quoi ?
Ça me fait mal.
Alors ne me regarde pas.
CANTINE DE LA PAROISSE - REPAS
MARDI, JEUDI ET VENDREDI
Un peu de nourriture te changera les idées.
Je préférerais que ça règle mes problèmes.
J'en ai vraiment marre.
Je me demande
quand je suis devenu si vieux.
Un peu plus de macaroni au fromage ?
- Salut, Bubs.
- Kima.
- Salut, Bob.
- McNulty. Mon préféré.
- T'es prêt à bosser ?
- Toujours prêt.
- Tu joues l’indic ? C'est dégueulasse.
- Non.
C'est mieux que de soulever des radiateurs
de 200 kilos. J'y vais.
C'est de l’argent facile.
Viens, on va se chercher un hamburger.
Ça te dérange pas si je me barre tôt ?
L’histoire de Cole m'a stressé.
Y a une veillée avec les inspecteurs
chez Kavanagh ce soir. Tu viens ?
Je le connaissais à peine.
Vous allez lui dire au revoir au bar ?
C'est la tradition. Demain, ce sera
l’enterrement avec sa famille.
Ce soir, Ray trinque avec ses amis.
Viens, Bubs. On n'a pas que ça à faire.
DÉMOCRATES DU DISTRICT EST
BARBECUE ANNUEL
Il veut se faire réélire
et aucun de ses projets de loi éducatifs
n'a jamais été voté.
Il prône le jardin d'enfants
en journée continue.
Qui est-ce que ça va déranger ?
Il a un projet de loi
qui législativement,
équivaut à embrasser un bébé.
Il va voir son président,
plaide sa cause et lui dit:
"Vous savez, si ça passe pas, je suis fini,
"je retourne dans ma quincaillerie,
au rayon peinture."
Le président prend pitié
et décide d'appuyer le projet de loi.
Mais le porte-parole déteste cette loi.
Il décide de la torpiller.
Ajoute un amendement
demandant 150 millions de plus
en subvention et autre,
et le projet subit un rejet retentissant,
122 à 10.
Pour le délégué, ça sent la quincaillerie.
Le président lui dit: "Désolé,
"je me suis battu comme un tigre
pour cette loi."
Avec des amis de ce genre...
Qui veut des amis dans ce milieu ?
Vaut mieux un chien.
<i>- Quoi ?
- On est occupés.</i>
<i>- Il faut que je lui parle.
- Je lui ai passé le message.</i>
<i>- Dis-lui que c'est Donette.
- T’es sûre qu’il te connaît ?</i>
Bien sûr qu'il me connaît.
- String, elle a dit...
- Pas maintenant.
Il a dit: "Pas maintenant." Je te laisse.
Marlo ? C'est un problème.
Un Perrier tranche.
Tu n'y arriveras pas comme ça.
À quoi ?
Excuse-moi.
J'étais pas censé savoir
que le maire allait vous en faire baver.
Vous avez lu le journal ? J'ai l’air de rien.
Mais non, vous avez du style.
Et vous avez sûrement marqué des points
avec Royce question loyauté.
INSPECTEUR
POLICE DE BALTIMORE
On est de la police.
Pas de mensonges entre nous.
C'était pas le plus grand inspecteur
qui soit, c'était pas non plus le pire.
Il a réglé quelques bonnes affaires
et en a bâclé d'autres.
Mais ce crétin a eu son heure de gloire.
Ça, c'est sûr.
Vous vous souvenez de l’extradition
du Mississippi ? Des incendies criminels ?
- Ouais.
- C'était lui.
Et le triple homicide
du club sur Hudson Street,
c'était Ray Cole au mieux de sa forme.
Et la guerre des gangs
sur Fayette Street en 1993.
Il a fait pas mal de nettoyage.
C'est vrai.
Il a perdu autant qu'il a gagné.
Un peu comme nous tous.
Bon sang, Hugh,
envoie la putain de chanson.
Il a épuisé quelques femmes ?
Sans aucun doute.
Mais la dernière s'était habituée à lui,
Dieu merci.
Il parlait parfois à tort et à travers ?
Est-ce qu'il dérangeait, rusait avec le fisc,
oubliait d'appeler sa mère et baisait
à droite à gauche de temps en temps ?
Personne n'est parfait, bon sang !
Était-il aussi incapable
que tous ces crétins d'inspecteurs
de la police de Baltimore ? Absolument.
Il était aussi faible que nous.
Mais Ray Cole était avec nous,
nous tous,
à Baltimore,
où il travaillait et prenait part
au côté sombre de l’expérience américaine.
Il a été appelé.
Il a servi.
Et il a compté.
Ce bon vieux King Cole.
Ce bon vieux King Cole !
Désolée, il faut que je les raccompagne
à la maison.
Je trouve
qu'ils ne s'en sont pas trop mal sortis.
Ils ont été super.
Et toi aussi, Jen. Vraiment.
Ils ont plus de photos de famille
qu'il n'en faut.
Tu ne rentres pas tout de suite ?
Il faut que je me mêle à la foule.
- Que j'inspire confiance aux gens.
- Moi, j'ai confiance...
- Merci.
...la plupart du temps.
Salope.
Pas trop tard si possible ?
Jimmy.
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.
Je comprends plus rien.
Tu te réveilles comme tous les matins,
tu bouffes, tu penses à tes factures,
au pressing,
à tes vacances, à ton plan retraite,
et tout à coup ?
Tu pars comme ça.
Comme ça.
Il est parti,
alors qu'il attendait ton feu vert
sur l’affaire Omar.
Je sais, putain. Je sais.
Il est parti comme ça.
Sur un tapis de course de mes deux.
Sur un tapis de course de mes deux.
Profitez de la vie, abrutis.
Ça va ?
Pas mal, cette tire.
Faut que je m'en trouve une comme ça.
C'est clair.
<i>Nous apprécions votre aide
et nous nous sommes fermement engagés</i>
<i>et reprendre le contrôle de vos rues.</i>
<i>Mais on ne peut pas le faire seuls.</i>
<i>Quand vous assistez à des activités
illégales, décrochez le téléphone</i>
<i>- et appelez pour...
- C'est des conneries !</i>
<i>Vous poserez vos questions plus tard...</i>
J'ai pas arrêté d'appeler la police pour virer
des dealers, et ça a servi à quoi ?
Ces mecs étaient de nouveau
au coin de la rue le lendemain !
<i>N’empêche que la police
ne peut pas tout faire seule.</i>
<i>Nous avons besoin de votre aide.</i>
Mon cousin Willy Gant a coopéré.
Il est allé au poste pour témoigner.
- Il est mort.
- C'est une honte.
<i>Écoutez, je sais que le problème
a l’air insurmontable,</i>
<i>mais nous avançons.</i>
<i>Regardez ce tableau.</i>
<i>Cette ligne indique...</i>
<i>- C’est moi qui ai le micro, madame.
- Laissez-la parler.</i>
Mes enfants ne peuvent plus jouer dehors.
Certaines nuits,
quand on entend ces coups de feu,
- on doit dormir sous nos lits.
- C'est vrai.
Je rentre du travail
et je ne peux même pas accéder
à ma porte d'entrée
car il y a des dealers juste devant.
Exact, racontez-lui !
Est-ce que c'est sur le tableau
que vous avez là-haut ?
<i>Je suis le major Colvin.</i>
<i>Je m’excuse de vous avoir donné
la mauvaise impression ce soir.</i>
<i>Nous ne voulons pas manquer de respect.</i>
<i>Je sais ce qui se passe dans vos quartiers.</i>
<i>Je le vois tous les jours.</i>
<i>Madame, ça me fait de la peine que vous
ne puissiez pas rentrer en toute sécurité</i>
<i>et dignement.</i>
<i>Pour être honnête,</i>
<i>je peux pas vous promettre
que ça va s’arranger.</i>
<i>On ne peut pas enfermer des milliers
de délinquants.</i>
<i>Il n’y aurait pas assez de place.</i>
<i>On montre les tableaux et les statistiques
comme s’ils voulaient dire quelque chose.</i>
<i>Mais ce soir, vous allez rentrer chez vous,</i>
<i>nous patrouillerons dans nos voitures,</i>
<i>et ces gars seront toujours postés
aux coins des rues,</i>
<i>en plein travail.</i>
<i>C’est le monde dans lequel nous vivons.</i>
<i>Et il est temps que nous ayons le bon sens</i>
<i>d’admettre au moins ça.</i>
Alors, quelle est la réponse ?
<i>Je ne suis pas sûr.</i>
<i>Mais quelle que soit la réponse,
ce ne peut être un mensonge.</i>
C'est la première fois qu'un flic dit ça.
À vous, sergent.
Comme je le disais...
Qui lui a donné un bidon d'essence
et lui a demandé de mettre le feu ?
<i>- Nous avançons...
- Tommy Carcetti.</i>
- Marla Daniels. Je vais...
- Piquer le siège d'Eunetta Perkins.
Je sais qui vous êtes.
Je vous ai déjà vue avec le délégué Watkins
à plusieurs reprises.
M. Le conseiller,
ce n'est pas votre district ici.
Quel bon vent vous amène ?
Je suis en charge du sous-comité
de la sécurité publique,
alors me voilà.
Bonne chance avec Eunetta.
Et bienvenue, Mme Daniels,
dans les nobles services publics.
<i>À l’ouest de vos quartiers,</i>
<i>le nombre de crimes contre
les commerçants a largement diminué.</i>
<i>Nous croyons
que nous faisons de grands...</i>
- Qu'est-ce que tu as fait ?
- Je suis fatigué de ces conneries.
Tu perds la raison quand tu es fatigué ?

POLICE DE BALTIMORE
SERVICE STATISTIQUES
ÉTAT DU MARYLAND
MISE SUR ÉCOUTE AUTORISÉE
BALTIMORE CAPITALE DU CRIME
"Pourquoi vous venez
foutre en l’air le plan ?" - Fruit
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez
de Bubs ? Exactement ?
L’état des lieux.
Qui contrôle les ventes
depuis la fin des tours.
On veut savoir ce qui est arrivé
aux gens de Barksdale.
Et ça paie combien ?
Considérons ça comme un travail normal.
Cinq dollars de l’heure.
Trente dollars par jour, max.
C'est moins que le salaire minimum.
Mais il n'y a pas de charge, Bubs.
C'est non imposable.
D'accord. Je suis content ici, vous savez.
De gagner du fric en travaillant.
- Je croyais que ton pote viendrait aussi.
- Johnny ?
Ça lui plaît pas trop
tous ces trucs avec vous.
En plus, c'est vraiment
un des Blancs les plus fainéants
qui ait existé.
Je bosse depuis que je suis gosse.
Ah oui ? Et il y a quoi sur ton C.V., Bubs ?
Je suis juste curieuse.
Je ne prétends pas avoir fait
des boulots normaux.
Ça fait un bail que j'ai pas pointé.
Depuis quand ?
Depuis très longtemps.
Avant que j'aie un casier.
Merde, j'étais...
C'était avant que je sois toxico.
J'avais un job de manutentionnaire
dans un de ces magasins
"le moins cher en ville".
Je déchargeais des appareils,
je sortais des climatiseurs
et d'autres trucs des voitures des clients.
Comme ça.
"Vous en voulez combien ?"
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
J'ai mis un radio-réveil dans une poubelle,
pour le récupérer, je me suis fait prendre.
J'avais même pas besoin de radio-réveil.
Voilà, c'est tout moi, un loser-né.
Bon, vous savez quoi ?
5 $ de l’heure, 30 $ par jour.
Ça va le faire.
Et voilà votre carte "sortez de prison’.
Sur cette carte, il y a mon nom
et mon numéro de téléphone.
Un policier a été tué dans ce quartier
il y a quelques semaines.
Vous savez tous
de quel incident je parle, hein ?
Je suis à la recherche de l’arme du policier.
Un Glock 9
qui a disparu pendant cet incident.
Maintenant, je me fiche...
Je me fiche de savoir qui l’a maintenant.
Je veux juste qu'il retourne
au poste de police.
Par hasard, vous connaîtriez pas
un gars nommé Peanut ?
Je m'en doutais. En tout cas, messieurs,
vous savez, les services sont récompensés.
Si vous me donnez une info sur ce flingue,
je fais disparaître vos charges.
Des questions ?
Ramenez-les.
Merde, il fallait que j'essaie quelque chose.
Une chacun. Une chacun.
Avancez. J'ai des capsules jaunes
à vendre toute la journée.
Bon, bon. Va le voir
si t'en veux de la bonne, d'accord ?
Merci bien.
- Il est en bas de Fremont ?
- Oui.
Maintenant, on est de ce côté.
Oh, et Barksdale est bien loin.
J'ai des capsules rouges, des rouges !
J'ai de l’héro !
Le voilà.
Yo, qui veut de l’héro ?
Viens chercher tes rouges, des rouges !
- Unité spéciale.
- Regarde.
- Doucement.
- Il n'est pas là.
- Bon.
- Qu'est-ce qui nous vaut l’honneur ?
Je viens bosser.
Pourquoi ? Tu prépares quelque chose ?
Rien de bien excitant.
J'avance doucement sur le cas
de Kintel Williamson,
notre cible définie.
On travaille aussi, Lester.
Oui, sur vos propres trucs.
Tu m'écoutes, McNulty ?
Je bosse sur un vrai cas.
Un mec nommé Stringer Bell.
T'as dû en entendre parler.
T'es vraiment gonflé, toi.
Il est toujours dehors, Lester.
Il a ses rues, son fric.
Putain. Maintenant,
il a plein d'immobilier en ville.
Il possède sûrement la moitié de la ville
- sans qu'on le sache.
- On s'en fout.
Tu sais ce qui est arrivé
à tout cet immobilier, Lester ?
Toutes ces propriétés de Bell en ville ?
Putain, non.
Il doit bien se foutre de nous
en ce moment. De toi, de Daniels.
Parle pour toi, McNulty !
Je parle du boulot.
Tu veux parler du boulot de la police ?
Je faisais déjà ce job
alors que tu en rêvais juste.
Daniels était là aussi.
Tu veux le baiser
alors qu'il t'a fait revenir avec nous ?
C'est un chef. Je l’emmerde.
Daniels est peut-être pas toujours clair
mais il a beaucoup donné pour le boulot !
Il mérite ta loyauté.
J'emmerde la loyauté et je t'emmerde.
J'aurais jamais cru
t'entendre dire de telles conneries.
Fils de pute, j'ai passé beaucoup de temps
dans de petites unités.
Plus que toi.
Peut-être que c'est pas parfait ici,
mais c'est une chance d'être un flic.
Alors, sois un flic.
Tu mérites même pas
que je perde mon temps à te frapper.
Jimmy, non.
Tu fous le feu à tout ce que tu touches,
et puis tu te barres alors que ça crame.
Je n'ai plus rien à te dire.
Rien.
Et toi,
tu m'étonnes vraiment.
Daniels s'est occupé de toi
depuis tes débuts.
On va voir Bubs.
Vérifie ces putains de propriétés.
Eh bien, major Colvin,
qu'est-ce que vous en pensez ?
Eh bien, ça a l’air bien.
Avant de vous donner ma réponse,
je dois en parler à ma femme.
Je ne parle pas du poste.
Mais du gâteau au fromage.
Il est bon.
Il vient de chez Michael, sur York Road.
Il a un peu de cannelle dans la croûte.
Y a rien de meilleur.
Bien sûr, je pense aussi
que notre offre est très bonne.
Excusez-moi,
je vais au petit coin, messieurs.
Je dois faire pipi.
Faire pipi ?
J'ai jamais compris pourquoi
un homme adulte parle comme ça.
Il doit pisser, il n'a plus cinq ans.
Vous vous habituerez
à ce genre de types, Bunny.
Surtout quand vous toucherez
votre premier salaire.
Je veux dire, 80000 $, c'est bien,
pour un poste de 2nd chef de la sécurité.
Plein d'avantages sociaux
pour votre retraite.
Oui, c'est généreux.
Et ennuyeux. Mais d'une bonne façon.
Je veux dire,
le pire que vous pourriez voir,
ce serait un viol.
Vous êtes prêt pour une vie plus relax ?
Oh que oui.
Oui, je me sentais comme ça aussi.
Mon seul regret,
c'est de ne pas avoir envoyé
le préfet adjoint aux opérations
se faire foutre en partant.
Hé, cette université vous veut, Bunny.
Et ils veulent vous donner un gros salaire.
Mais quoi ?
Vous voulez demander à votre femme ?
Mais non, j'ai rien à lui demander.
Je laisse juste
M. Jenkins mariner un peu, c'est tout.
Je me demande ce qu'il fabrique.
Il devait juste faire pipi.
Peut-être qu'il a eu aussi envie
de faire popo.
Ils ont les coins sur Argyle,
et tout au long de Fremont.
Les coins des avenues sont
à tout le monde.
Certains étaient avec Barksdale,
d'autres étaient indépendants.
Il y a des mecs de Barksdale
sur McHenry Street aussi.
Mais la clique de Gangster Webster
est juste de l’autre côté.
Et les coins de Lower Avenue
et de la cité Poe ?
Lls sont à ce jeune nommé Marlo.
- Il se fait appeler Black.
- Marlo ?
Un jeune.
Il a plein d'immobilier en ville.
Il a les affaires
qui se font entre midi et deux.
Si Bell et Barksdale
gardaient quelque chose,
ce serait les coins de la cité Poe
et sur Lower Avenue.
Marlo travaille pour Barksdale ?
Marlo quoi ?
Allez, tu sais autre chose sur ce type ?
Vous avez peut-être encore un peu de fric ?
C'est bien la peine
de te payer 5 $ de l’heure.
107M703. Oui.
C'est la plaque d'immatriculation
de sa caisse.
107M703.
Est-ce que tu l’as amorcée ?
Ce petit rond en caoutchouc là,
à côté de la bougie.
Faut appuyer dessus 3 fois
avant d'essayer de la démarrer.
Ça fait aller l’essence dans le carburateur.
Vous voulez savoir la vérité ?
Je n'ai jamais utilisé de tondeuse.
J'en ai jamais eu besoin.
Eh bien, je t'ai pas embauché
pour tes compétences en jardinage.
Tous ces latinos ?
Lls ont fait de la prison aussi.
Je n'utilise que des gens comme vous.
Des fois, ça me crée des problèmes,
des fois, ça marche bien.
- Combien d'années de taule vous avez eu ?
- Dix ans.
Il fait vraiment chaud ici.
Oui, il fait chaud. Tous les jours.
Et tu vas te faire trimballer à l’arrière
de ce gros camion
tous les jours.
Et ton dos va te faire souffrir tous les jours.
Avant, je conduisais une Mercedes.
Un cabriolet doré. Avec de belles jantes.
Je ne pense même plus à cette voiture.
C'est du passé pour vous, hein ?
Certains peuvent faire ça.
Ce que je veux dire,
c'est que si tu veux rester dans la légalité,
ça paie pas beaucoup.
C'est ça.
Amorce cette salope trois fois
et elle démarrera.
- Mlle Pearlman ?
- Cédric.
Comment ça avance
avec Kintel Williamson ?
- Tu as quelque chose pour moi ?
- Non, pas encore.
On va y arriver.
Tu es venu juste pour me dire ça ?
Je veux juste garder le dialogue ouvert.
Tu travailles sur quoi ?
Oh, il y a plein de surprises.
Audition de liberté conditionnelle. Déjà ?
Apparemment, il a dénoncé
un gardien corrompu à Jessup.
Il a gagné les faveurs des autorités.
N'importe quoi.
Eh bien, ne t'en fais pas.
Ils ne m'ont pas envoyé
les avis d'audition pour rien.
"M. Barksdale dirigeait un grand
réseau criminel opérant 24 h sur 24 h
"et était un grand trafiquant de drogues.
"De 1999 à 2002,
"on l’a fortement soupçonné
d'avoir ordonné ou causé
"la mort de plus
d'une douzaine de personnes."
La commission ne va pas le libérer
après sa première audition.
Pas après une lettre comme ça.
- Beau travail.
- Il m'arrive d'être inspirée.
Joli costume, d'ailleurs.
Merci.
Je vois que tu portes à gauche.
Tous les jours.
<i>Le numéro composé n’est plus attribué.</i>
<i>En cas d’erreur,</i>
<i>veuillez vérifier le numéro et...</i>
Rien ?
C'est une adresse sur Reisterstown,
celle qu'il a donnée il y a deux ans,
quand il a fait immatriculer sa caisse.
- Stringer est un mec rangé.
- Non, pas du tout.
C'était une femme qui habitait là.
Juste une façade.
Sa copine, peut-être.
Oui, s'il les aime vieilles et très moches.
Elle doit être gentille.
Bon esprit de camaraderie.
Dit toujours bonjour.
Tu crois qu'il l’a rencontrée à la fac ?
Quoi ? Qu'est-ce que j'ai dit ?
Qu'est-ce que t'as trouvé ?
L’adresse associée à la plaque
est un coin sur Dukeland.
Une femme, 53 ans.
C'est comme ça qu'ils font.
Mais j'ai un résultat sur Marlo,
nom de rue: Black.
Marlo Stanfield. 22 ans.
Fiché chez nous avec un assez bon casier.
Tu croyais qu'il aurait rien ?
Oh, je savais bien qu'il aurait un passé
criminel, mais pas comme ça.
Viens voir.
Je vais faire un tour en ville à la crim.
Tu veux venir ?
Non, je dois aller ailleurs.
Ce truc avec Lester,
ça me fait chier.
Eh bien, tu vas t'y habituer.
On y va et on sort de la voiture.
On écarte la foule comme la mer Rouge,
la victime est au sol, en sang.
Elle crie: "Je vais la tuer, cette salope."
Mais c'est comme si tout allait bien
pour lui...
Oh, merde.
T'essaies de passer inaperçu ?
Moi qui voulais pas qu'on me voie.
Pour un homme costaud,
tu as la grâce d'un danseur.
Mais j'ai un œil de lynx.
Et le fait de se faufiler
comme ça dans le bureau,
ça n'augure rien de bon
pour la réunification de notre équipe.
Je comprends.
Quoi de neuf, M. Bunk ?
Salut, poulette.
Vernon Holley bosse ce soir ?
Oui, de 16 h à minuit.
Va voir dans la cuisine.
D'accord.
Je me la ferais bien,
- si elle était pas...
- Spéciale ?
Crossfield, réponds à cet appel.
- Retrouve ce flingue.
- Oui, d'accord.
Fils de pute.
Marlo Stanfield, alias Black.
- Ce garçon est un vrai démon, Kima.
- Je vois.
Et on l’a presque eu pour ce meurtre.
- Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
- On avait un témoin.
Un garçon appelé Pooh Bear,
un gars potelé avec des tresses.
On l’avait planqué dans le quartier est,
on lui avait même mis
un bracelet électronique,
pour pouvoir le trouver rapidement.
- Vous l’avez perdu ?
- Pas exactement.
Pooh est allé dans l’ouest
pour acheter de la beu.
Il aurait pu acheter
la même herbe là où il était, non ?
On l’a trouvé avec 2 balles dans le torse
et une dans la bouche.
Le bracelet nous a menés à son cadavre.
Ces trucs marchent bien.
Oui. Marlo ne déconne pas.
Ce fils de pute est dangereux.
Je sais pas, je crois qu'un volcan,
c'est bien mieux qu'un ordinateur.
Tu vois des ordis tous les jours.
Tu vois souvent des volcans ?
Mais il a monté cet ordi tout seul.
Tu as fabriqué ce volcan.
Génial.
Je peux le garder ?
Oui, si tu veux.
- Bonne nuit, Mikey.
- Bonne nuit.
- Dors bien.
- D'accord.
C'est bien que tu sois venu.
- Il était très fier.
- Je suis content.
Jimmy, il y a un problème
avec la pension alimentaire.
Quoi ?
Tu n'as pas payé depuis quatre mois.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux que je te dise ?
Je paie 2000 $ .
- Après ça, il ne me reste plus rien.
- Bon.
Mais tu as signé un accord de séparation
qui me donne droit à 1000 $ de plus.
J'ai signé car je pensais
qu'on se remettrait ensemble.
Tu sais combien je gagne. Je suis loin
de pouvoir payer tout ça chaque mois.
Mon avocat dit
qu'on doit t'assigner en justice.
Ton cadre de mec peut pas lâcher
un peu de fric ?
Je suis trop fauché pour te filer de l’argent.
À partir d'aujourd'hui,
de la drogue peut être vendue
dans le quartier ouest,
mais seulement là où on l’autorise.
Bousculez-les.
Au travail, et ne vous faites pas avoir.
Hé ! Bouge pas.
Mets-le contre le mur.
Écoutez ce que j'ai à vous dire.
Vous savez,
c'est très simple, ce qu'on a à vous dire.
Si vous restez ici, on va vous arrêter.
Si vous bougez dans la zone de non-droit,
devant les immeubles vides
de Vincent Street,
vous pourrez faire
tout ce que vous voulez !
On ne peut pas être plus sympas.
Hé, je t'ai vu, petit con.
Comment tu t'appelles ?
Comment tu t'appelles ?
Peanut Butter et Jelly.
Adresse ?
C'est quoi ton adresse ?
J'habite Dolphin Street.
Ton adresse, couilles molles.
Y a pas des chiffres sur le devant
de ta putain de maison ?
Écoutez.
Ce coin est surveillé.
On reviendra demain, et on vous arrêtera,
à moins que vous ne déménagiez
sur Vincent Street,
là où personne n'habite.
Si vous faites ça, on vous emmerde plus.
Vincent Street,
c'est comme la Suisse ou Amsterdam.
Ça veut dire quoi, bordel ?
C'est des pays où les drogues sont légales.
Vincent Street,
c'est votre Amsterdam à Baltimore.
Si vous allez là, on s'en fout.
Si vous restez ici, vous allez en taule.
Je vais pas aller à Hamsterdam.
Il a tué un témoin, hein ?
Selon Vernon Holley, oui.
Alors, Marlo est un tueur à gages.
Peut-être qu'il bosse pour Stringer.
Ça paraît logique.
Si t'as besoin de moi,
je suis dans l’ouest. Et toi ?
Je vais chercher des indices sur Stringer.
On l’a trop laissé tranquille.
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Quelque chose que Prez a dit.
"P et P" ?
B et B. Comme l’alcool.
Vous voulez dire, liqueur, Plauzinski...
- Pryzbylewski.
- Bénédictine et Brandy.
Ça a été inventé par un barman du Club 21.
Toute cette merde vient de New York.
Il me faut tous les transferts de titres
impliquant cette société.
Aujourd'hui.
J'ai demandé aux mecs de ce coin
s'ils savent
où est la clique de Barksdale.
Et ils me regardent
comme si je parlais même pas.
Dans cette zone,
le nom de Marlo est le plus connu.
Il est là. Tu le vois ?
Il n'est pas resté longtemps.
Oui, Marlo fait profil bas.
Nous ne divulguons pas de données
personnelles sur nos étudiants inscrits.
Eh bien, je peux revenir avec un mandat.
- Faites, et je vous renseignerai.
- Écoutez.
Cet homme n'est pas un ange
avec les femmes.
Violence conjugale,
des trucs vraiment moches.
Je ne peux pas vous montrer de papiers.
Mais vous pouvez regarder sur mon écran.
Qu'est-ce qu'on vous a dit, putain ?
On vous a dit de bouger
dans la zone de non-droit, non ?
On essaie de vous foutre un peu la paix.
On vous offre... Une quoi déjà ?
Une amnistie.
Allez dealer sur Vincent Street.
Vous faites votre sale business,
personne vous dérange.
Qu'est-ce que vous en dites ?
Vous êtes cons ou quoi ?
Qu'est-ce que vous en dites ?
Pourquoi vous venez pour essayer
de nous manipuler ?
Quoi ?
Vous faites comme si on était débiles...
- C'est mieux de vous frapper ?
- On est plus habitués.
- On est sérieux, ducon !
- On deale, vous nous courez après.
Ça marche comme ça.
Pourquoi vous venez foutre en l’air
le plan ?
Avec tout le respect que je vous dois.
Rien que des mauvaises herbes.
Faites passer quelques bus par ici.
Demain, on va nettoyer les rues.
On va tous les rassembler
et les mettre au courant.
Et je ne demande plus.
D'ici à Fremont,
il y a les mecs de Barksdale,
des mecs de l’est et des indépendants.
- Au même endroit ?
- Oui.
Ça n'a pas de sens.
Yo, on dit qu'on a fini, là, Kima ?
- Saloperie.
- Toi aussi ?
Lls marchent pas, ces téléphones ?
Je vois des gosses en jeter
toute la journée.
Ils ont autant d'argent à gaspiller ?
On en trouve. Des fois, on a de la chance.
Il reste quelques minutes,
on les revend pas cher.
- Ils sont jetables, Kima.
- Jetables ?
Mon Dieu, un autre meurtre.
À Waverly, rien que ça. Vous y croyez ?
Je serais choqué si c'est un Afro-Américain
qui a perpétré ce crime.
C'est même pas drôle, Ash.
C'est pour ça que tout le monde quitte
la ville, les Blancs et les Noirs.
Je suis allé à la réunion du quartier ouest.
Les gens étaient furieux, et ils ont raison.
Ils pourraient déménager.
S'ils voulaient travailler.
J'ai entendu ça toute ma vie:
"Mon père immigré
"a réussi, les Noirs sont des paresseux."
Il y a des gens bien dans l’ouest
- qui veulent la même chose que toi...
- D'accord, Mme Roosevelt.
Je veux dire
que ce n'est pas une question de couleur.
Alors, qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
<i>The Sun dit que le siège du sénateur
Anderson est disponible.</i>
Putain, tu pourrais prendre la place
de Ruppersberger.
Il n'a qu'un seul mandat.
Je vais faire campagne pour être maire.
C'est bien. Maire Tommy.
Est-elle au bon endroit ?
Je m'assieds à côté d'elle,
je lui paie un verre.
- On te donne 10 $ chacun.
- 20 $ si tu couches avec.
Je vous en prie,
ayez un peu plus de classe.
En plus, j'ai déjà eu ma place au soleil.
N'importe quoi. Homme à femmes un jour...
Pari tenu. Vous dites que j'ai perdu
la main, je vais vous prouver le contraire.
- Tu paries, Pete ?
- Non.
Je peux avoir deux Glenlivets ?
Ça va ?
- Le fils de pute a réussi.
- Il t'a arnaqué.
C'est Theresa D'Agostino.
La fille de Mario D ?
Elle a bien tourné.
Elle bosse à Washington maintenant
pour le parti national.
Elle s'occupe des campagnes.
Ah ouais.
Tommy la connaît depuis l’école de droit.
Écoute-moi, d'accord ? Un verre.
Vas-y. C'est toi qui paies.
- En fait, c'est eux qui paient.
- Tu as fait un pari.
Ne me dis pas qu'on doit s'embrasser.
Ça n'arrivera pas.
C'est pas une histoire de bondage
dans une chambre d'hôtel ?
Parce que le dîner des anciens s'est fini
il y a 1 heure et je pourrais...
C'est l’ancien moi, Terri.
Tout ce que j'ai maintenant,
ma femme, mes gosses,
je ne risquerais pas de les perdre.
Pas question.
Te voir avec tes anciens potes,
ça m'a fait penser à mal.
Tes amis t'avilissent, Tommy.
Tu es énervée car ils t'ont pas reconnue
quand tu es entrée.
Pourquoi te reconnaîtraient-ils ?
Je veux dire, tu es
une dame de Washington maintenant.
C'est Pete Sinopoli non, là-bas ?
- Il est de nouveau avocat.
- Oui.
Il n'était pas assez bon pour la politique.
Moi, je suis assez bon, Terri.
Je vais essayer de devenir maire.
Et tu vas diriger ma campagne.
Donne-moi une bonne raison
de pas le faire.
Je pourrais t'en donner 10,
mais y en a une de vraiment bonne.
Tu es de la mauvaise couleur.
Tu ne peux pas être élu ici.
- Je ne travaille jamais pour le perdant.
- Tu aimes gagner.
Je n'aime pas perdre. C'est différent.
Où est le plaisir si tu sais que tu gagnes ?
Je veux dire, tu t'es occupée
de ce démocrate à Los Angeles...
- Garcia...
- Valdez.
Valdez. C'était dur ?
J'ai besoin de quelqu'un comme toi
à mes côtés.
J'ai besoin de toi.
Qu'est-ce que j'aurais comme bonus ?
Faire élire un maire blanc à Baltimore,
là, c'est toi qui choisis le prix.
On avait dit juste un verre.
Rentre chez toi, la nuit porte conseil.
Demain, au réveil, tu te rendras compte
que tu fais erreur.
Je peux le faire.
La question, c'est:
Est-ce que tu es avec moi ?
B et B.
<i>Allô ?</i>
Yo, pourquoi on va pas
tirer sur ces enculés ?
Une petite engueulade et on s'écrase
comme des meufs.
On reste dans cette putain de rue.
On n'a même pas assez de business
pour Poot et son gang, bordel.
Écoute, mec,
Stringer va arranger ça, tu verras.
Qui est Slim Charles ?
- De la part de qui ?
- Cutty.
Un pote m'a filé ton numéro
et m'a dit de t'appeler
quand je serai prêt à bosser.
Mais pas de réponse.
Tu as pris ton temps pour rappeler, hein ?
Les numéros sont plus bons
après quelques jours, mec.
- On les change.
- Mais tu sais rien, ou quoi ?
Respect, mec, respect.
Tu sais pas à qui tu parles.
- T'as pas dit pourquoi t'es ici.
- Pour me faire embaucher.
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux faire ?
- N'importe quoi qui rapporte.
Yo, Poot. Ramène-toi, mec.
Écoute, mec, appelle Shamrock, mec,
et dis-lui que le soldat est finalement arrivé
au camp.
T'es un soldat ?
Du calme, Bodie, mec, du calme.
- Bodie Broadus ?
- Oui.
Merde, je me souviens de toi
alors que t'étais encore bébé.
Je m'entraînais à la boxe
avec ton grand frère, James.
Ce gars avait un gauche mortel.
Oui, quand il ne cognait pas trop bas.
Il est toujours dans le coin ?
Il est mort.
C'est quoi ce bordel avec ce bus ?
Vous êtes jamais allé
dans un bus scolaire avant ?
Qu'est-ce qu'ils foutent avec ces mecs ?
Écoute, mon pote, la première chose
à faire, c'est de te trouver un flingue.
Viens, mec.
Putain de téléphone. Merde.
Yo, TJ, t'en as pas un
avec des minutes restantes ?
Vous pourriez faire du multi-usage
avec vos propriétés sur Howard Street.
- Des habitations et des commerces.
- Sur Howard Street ?
Le but des subventions,
c'est de réhabiliter le quartier ouest.
Le projet de l’hippodrome
était juste un début.
Mais des habitations ?
Avec le stade et le théâtre de nouveau là,
toute la zone est comme Inner Harbor East
il y a 10 ans.
Vous êtes en très bonne position
avec ce que vous possédez.
- Oui, c'est vrai, String.
- Alors, ça va rapporter plus
que juste racheter les propriétés
et les revendre.
Beaucoup plus.
Excusez-moi.
Yo. Non. Pas maintenant.
Dans une demi-heure.
Non, fais-le, remplis-le.
Tu as le numéro de commande, non ?
- Allez, bouge ton cul.
- C'est n'importe quoi.
Ma mère va s'inquiéter, merde.
Vous kidnappez des blacks.
Je suis le major Colvin.
Je suis le major Colvin.
- Le major quoi ?
- Le major de mes couilles.
On a dû vous emmener ici cet après-midi
parce que vous ne suivez pas
nos directives.
Quoi ?
Vous n'avez pas fait ce qu'on vous a dit.
Yo.
Quand j'aurai fini.
Faut que j'aille pisser.
Il déconne pas. Ça sent comme
s'il avait déjà pissé dans son froc.
Bon, vas-y.
Je dois y aller aussi.
Eh bien, tu vas devoir attendre.
C'est de la discrimination.
Yo, pédé, pourquoi tu me touches le cul ?
Ça suffit !
On arrête de rigoler.
Tyrell, pourquoi tu n'es pas allé
à l’école aujourd'hui ?
J'ai mal au ventre. J'ai la diarrhée.
Lève-toi quand je te parle, jeune homme.
Je connais ta mère, Tyrell.
Elle n'a pas élevé de clowns, n'est-ce pas ?
Non, madame.
C'est à vous, major.
Mesdames et messieurs,
on vous a emmenés ici
pour vous apprendre à...
Notre nouvelle façon de gérer les rues.
- C'est au centre-ville.
- Oui.
- Ça n'a pas de sens.
- Les quatre.
Allez, vas-y, engueule-moi.
Demande-moi où j'étais passé.
À toi de nous le dire.
La secrétaire m'a filé
les horaires des cours de Stringer.
Je l’ai suivi jusqu'à sa piaule
dans une tour au centre-ville.
Son nom est sur le bail.
Il fait rien pour le cacher.
Le lendemain, je l’ai suivi de chez lui
à un déjeuner d'affaires
avec le sénateur.
Celui qui était
avec le collecteur de fonds sales.
Quelques autres Blancs inconnus
à la table.
Et pendant ce temps, Stringer téléphonait
devant ces notables,
comme si de rien n'était.
Je l’ai même appelé moi-même.
Y avait son numéro
sur le formulaire de la fac.
Ce serait pas le 844-7393 ?
Prez m'a eu les évaluations des propriétés
de B et B
et les transferts de terrain
du tribunal correctionnel.
Il fallait un numéro pour certains papiers.
Alors, ça ne m'étonne pas
qu'il utilise son portable aussi librement.
Voilà les appels sortants et entrants
de son portable.
Et presque tous les numéros
viennent du centre-ville.
Des cabinets d'architectes,
le bureau des permis de la ville,
des avocats, des bureaux de zonage.
Même des appels de l’université.
- Tu veux dire qu'il s'est rangé ?
- Il appelle des gens respectables.
Il a ce numéro
depuis longtemps.
Bon travail.
Peut-être que ce portable est propre
parce qu'il le garde.
S'il était sale, ce serait sûrement un jetable.
Des téléphones jetables.
La dernière technologie pour dealers.
Ils font quelques appels avec le jetable,
puis ils le jettent.
Ils en achètent un autre, font pareil.
Il y a plus de ces trucs par terre
dans le quartier ouest
que de capsules vides.
Comment peut-on mettre
ces trucs sur écoute, bon sang ?
D'abord, il y avait les cabines
téléphoniques et les pagers.
Puis, il y a eu les portables
et les rendez-vous. Maintenant, ça.
Les fils de pute apprennent vite.
Chaque fois qu'on les gêne,
ils apprennent et ils s'adaptent.
Alors...
On peut pas atteindre Stringer.
Vous savez, il y a quelques années,
quand ils achetaient des immeubles
au centre-ville,
je pense qu'ils achetaient pour revendre
et gagner de l’argent, et les propriétés
étaient déclarées inhabitables.
Bell et Barksdale n'ont rien vendu.
Ils achètent toujours plus,
et ils demandent des permis de construire.
On dirait que Stringer Bell
est pire qu'un dealer.
C'est un promoteur.
Merde, il fait des vraies affaires ?
Tu es un vrai flic.
On l’a retrouvé, pourquoi t'irais pas
lui poser des questions ?
Il te faut quelques jours, je vais gagner
du temps avec Daniels. Mais après,
tu ramènes un cas qu'on peut utiliser,
ou tu ravales ta putain de fierté
et tu rejoins cette unité.
Comment ça va, Donette ?
"Ça va, String. Tu m'as manqué, chéri."
Écoute, je suis désolé
de ne pas t'avoir rappelée.
Ton "désolé" ne me tient pas
chaud au lit la nuit.
J'étais occupé, ma puce.
C'est pas comme si j'essayais de me
débarrasser de toi. Je fais des affaires.
Tu sais ce que ça fait
d'être toute seule ici ?
Avec la police qui vient, et moi,
j'ai personne pour m'aider.
Tu as dit que l’inspecteur
t'a laissé une carte ?
Il a dit que D'Angelo ne s'était pas suicidé.
À cause des marques qu'il avait sur le cou.
Il a dit qu'il a pu être assassiné.
Assieds-toi.
Écoute-moi.
Tout le monde dans cette prison
sait qui est Avon.
Personne ne va tuer son neveu.
D'accord ?
En ce qui nous concerne,
j'ai fait une erreur en m'éloignant de toi,
mais ça ne va pas se reproduire.
Oh oui.
C'est l’œuvre de Dieu.
Ça ne peut pas être un accident.
Alors pourquoi tu me paies des verres
ce soir ? Dis la vérité.
Elle ferait mieux de ne pas oser
repasser devant moi.
Alors pourquoi, Bunk ?
J'ai deux morts,
dans ce qui semble être
un vol de drogue à Pimlico.
Et les jeunes là-bas
ont l’air de connaître Omar de vue.
Il me faut Omar, Jimmy.
Encore ? Bon sang, Bunk.
Oui.
Laisse tomber.
On fait le plan numéro 3 ?
Ça a marché pour toi la dernière fois.
La blonde au juke-box.
Oh, je l’aimais bien.
Tout le monde aime tout le monde
avec un baiser.
Mais non, mon amie là-bas...
Je pense qu'elle est un numéro 2.
Ma mère est morte il y a une semaine.
J'ai du mal à m'en remettre.
C'est pourquoi je suis si déprimé ce soir.
- D'accord, ta mère est morte et tu es triste.
- Oui.
T'es un pote, toi.
La même chose.
Ma mère est morte la semaine dernière et...
- Yo.
- Quoi de neuf, chef ?
Tu as les reçus des téléphones
du voyage en Virginie ?
Bien.
Maintenant, je veux que tu t'occupes de ça.
D'accord.
Si Bernard fait comme on a dit
et fait ces voyages,
je ne veux plus avoir à m'occuper de ça.
Bien sûr.
- Et si Donette m'appelle...
- Je sais.
- Il faut lui dire que tu es occupé.
- Non.
Je prendrai ses appels.
Ronnie ?
Ronnie, Ronnie !
Rhonda !
POLICE - VILLE DE BALTIMORE
Il a été fortement soupçonné
d'avoir ordonné ou causé la mort
- de plus de douze personnes.
- Soupçonné.
C'est une rumeur, des bruits qui courent.
Il n'y a aucune nouvelle allégation
dans cette lettre
de la part de l’assistante du procureur
depuis le procès.
Vu que mon client a un très bon dossier
depuis son incarcération
et qu'il a beaucoup contribué à identifier
la cause de ces morts par overdoses
ici-même, l’année dernière,
je vous demande respectueusement
d'honorer notre accord
- et d'approuver sa remise en liberté.
- Je rêve !
Gardez vos commentaires pour vous.
Nous nous sommes engagés.
Vu ce qui se passait dans vos murs
l’an passé,
c'est le moins que vous puissiez faire.
De l’héro Rockefeller !
C'est lui là-bas. Dans la Sedan G35.
- Le mec avec le t-shirt rétro ?
- Cool, ce t-shirt.
Y a intérêt, il coûte 430 $ .
Je vais m'acheter un de ces putain de trucs.
Tu vas devoir prendre
celui du petit Mugsy Bogues.
Sinon, tu vas flotter dans celui-là, nabot.
Comme d'habitude, vous pigez rien,
bande de nazes.
Il a pas ramené assez d'argent
la semaine dernière
et vous voyez tous comment il deale.
Alors, il est où ce fric ?
Il faut regarder plus loin
que sa caisse ou ses fringues.
Il a une copine ?
Il sort avec une petite branque du lycée.
Elle a des diamants ?
Elle a un beau cul,
c'est tout ce dont je me souviens.
C'est clair.
Bon, surveille la fille.
Une lycéenne avec un collier en platine,
ça peut venir que d'un seul endroit.
Donne-lui son truc.
Un SIG Sauer.
C'est pas de la merde, mon pote.
Je m'y connais en flingues, mec.
Un calibre 38, ça s'enraye pas.
Ça contient pas 15 balles, non plus.
Les temps ont changé.
Non. C'est juste devenu plus violent.
- Ça m'intéresse pas trop, les vacances.
- Qui a le temps pour ça ?
Pourquoi vous n'emmèneriez pas vos fils
passer un week-end à la mer ?
Vous êtes déjà allé à la mer ?
Écoutez.
Ce n'est pas comme si j'attendais
une ouverture avec Rhonda.
C'est arrivé, c'est tout.
J'aurais dû vous le dire avant.
Je dois savoir si ça va créer des problèmes
entre nous.
Non, je vous souhaite
plein de bonnes choses.
J'ai fait beaucoup de bruit hier soir ?
Merci de ne pas me compliquer la vie.
Vous venez ?
Non, je vais rester finir
ce verre tranquillement.
Et puis je rentrerai.
Deux autres bières.
La forme ?
C'est parti.
C'est de la balle.
Bois ça.
Ça m'étonne qu'Avon vous laisse
faire la fête et vous défoncer.
Des fois, faut bien.
Tu vas planer, mon pote.
- On y va ?
- Oui. Tu peux conduire ?
Je croyais que c'était toi
qui devais conduire ce soir.
Non, ça va vraiment, je peux conduire.
Bonne nuit.
Une meuf avec une seule jambe
qui s'appelle Aaliyah.
C'est quoi ça ?
Oh, merde.
- T'aimes toujours les gonzesses, non ?
- Merde.
Il est de retour dans la zone.
Non, Bubs. Attends, faut des règles,
sinon c'est le bordel.
Y a pas de règles avec les camés.
Si les flics te serrent,
tu dois te bouger, ça d'accord.
T'essaies de t'en sortir.
Mais baver sans raison, ça n'a aucun...
Attends ! Je te suis pas.
Tu veux dire qu'on peut balancer
si on est en taule
mais pas pour se faire du fric ?
Franchement, mec, te vexe pas,
mais c'est un raisonnement à la con.
Tu délires grave.
Pour toi, une balance, c'est une balance ?
- T'as pigé.
- Alors, pourquoi on balancerait ?
On se débrouille avec nos casses.
On fait des coups à longueur de journée
et ça nous rapporte rien, putain.
C'est le lot des durs.
Enfin, c'est pourtant toi qui le dis.
Ouais, c'est pour ça
que je tiens pas en place.
Tu verras. Quand tu seras plus un môme.
Tu verras si t'as pas envie
d'un truc stable, un truc à toi.
Quoi, putain ? T'es déjà mal ?
Il est même pas midi.
Ça va, mec. Je vais bien, super bien.
Écoute, on va voir ma copine Kima,
on se fait payer, comme ça t'iras mieux.
Laisse tomber, Bubs, tu veux ?
Je suis pas une balance, merde.
On peut voir ça autrement.
Si tu baves pour éviter la taule,
t'es une balance.
Si tu le fais pour le fric,
t'es un professionnel.
Attends, bouge pas.
Tu vois l’échelle, là-bas ?
Comme au bon vieux temps, mec.
Je fais le méchant, tu joues les sauveurs.
Oublie ce type.
On se fera plus en allant voir ma copine.
Mais là on se fait du cash direct.
C'est un Blanc, c'est moi
qui fais le méchant. Il comprendra mieux.
Bon, on se retrouve dans la ruelle.
Fais chier.
- Hé, monsieur.
- Oui ?
Balancez votre portefeuille
ou je fais gicler l’échelle.
- Quoi ? Non.
- Un mec fauché, ça plaisante pas.
- Jetez votre putain de fric.
- Non, pitié. À l’aide !
- D'accord.
- Hé ! Laissez cet homme tranquille.
Oh, merci.
C'est dingue, enfin.
- Qu'est-ce qui lui a pris ?
- Merde.
- Tenez, voilà.
- Je peux pas, vraiment.
Si, vous m'avez sauvé la mise.
Ça compte pour moi.
Hé, Bubs, tu vas halluciner.
Bubs...
INSPECTEUR
POLICE DE BALTIMORE
SUR ÉCOUTE
POLICE DE BALTIMORE
SERVICE STATISTIQUES
ÉTAT DU MARYLAND
MISE SUR ÉCOUTE AUTORISÉE
BALTIMORE CAPITALE DU CRIME
"J'avais des projets pour nous, merde."
- McNulty
Dennis, t'es levé ? Dennis !
Salut, Mee-maw.
- Tu travailles pas aujourd'hui ?
- Je bosse de nuit, maintenant.
Dans un bar. Je suis videur.
Tu sais, c'est seulement...
- Seulement en attendant mieux.
- Si tu le dis.
Ça me fait penser.
Ton amie a encore téléphoné ce matin.
Elle voulait te rappeler ton rendez-vous.
Elle a dit que tu pourrais avoir le job,
si ça t'intéresse toujours.
Alors, Marlo.
Il est toujours flanqué d'un type
du nom de Chris Partlow.
Bartlow, avec un "B" ?
"Part’, comme un kart, mais avec un "P".
- Et "low", comme dans "l’autre camé".
- Partlow.
- C'est ce que je j'ai dit.
- L’homme de main de Marlo.
Il paraît que...
Appel de Cheryl
- Ça vaut combien ?
- 5 $, si ça mène à quelqu'un.
Il était à ce type, Fruit.
Fruit, celui qui deale pour Marlo ?
- Fais gaffe aux empreintes.
- Les empreintes ? Écoute-toi,
on se croirait dans une série télé.
Sérieux, un portable plein d'empreintes,
ça vaut un peu de liquide ?
Mettons que j'aie une empreinte
qui désigne Fruit, j'irai jusqu'à 10 $ .
Et si je te montre
où Marlo planque sa Mercedes ?
La caisse vaut 15 $ .
Hé, tu as pas l’air de savoir
que les temps sont durs.
Tu es dure avec moi.
D'accord. 25 $ pour la Mercedes.
Tu es trop bonne.
Récapitulons. Ça fait 40 $ en tout, hein ?
- Tiens, mets ça de côté pour moi.
- De côté ? Pour quoi faire ?
J'ai un plan.
Les dealers du coin,
ils mettent leurs immenses t-shirts blancs
deux, trois fois et les balancent.
Alors, pendant que je bosse pour toi,
je mets quelques sous de côté
et je leur vends des t-shirts dans la rue.
Je gagne sur les deux tableaux.
C'est vrai, vous pouviez pas faire mieux.
Charlie a raison, chef.
- Vous avez essayé.
- Ces dealers ne veulent rien savoir.
Vous leur offrez un bout de trottoir
où ils peuvent vendre leur came peinards,
et ils écoutent même pas.
C'est vraiment dommage,
si ça avait marché,
vous auriez pu faire quelque chose
pour cette société.
<i>Le responsable des horaires,
appelez l’accueil.</i>
Vous êtes vraiment
des putains de menteurs.
- Permettez, monsieur...
- Quelque chose me dit
que vous pensez savoir
ce que nous devrions faire maintenant.
Nous avons pensé
à une opération conjointe.
Des patrouilles d'intervention rapide
et aucune indulgence.
On prélève quelques hommes
sur les effectifs, on monte une unité mobile
et on accélère le nettoyage du quartier.
- Un concentré d'avant, donc.
- Mais en mieux.
En mieux ?
C'est mieux que rien.
Putain, j'en ai ma claque.
Ils nous filent 15 boîtes
de papier grand format
mais ils oublient le papier à lettres.
Qu'est-ce qu'ils ont ?
Je m'en occupe.
- Monsieur l’agent.
- Inspecteur, String.
Rappelle-toi. Le procès Bird.
Inspecteur McNulty.
Besoin de photocopies, peut-être ?
Des mandats d'arrêt, des formulaires ?
- Si je peux vous aider.
- Je te vois plus traîner dans le coin.
Je ne traîne plus nulle part.
Si on me cherche, je suis ici.
Ici, hein ?
J'ai que cette affaire
et un immeuble que je retape.
Vous savez, ça m'occupe largement assez.
- Dites, vous habitez où ?
- Où j'habite ?
Si vous avez envie
de vous rapprocher du centre,
j'aurai quelques appartements refaits à neuf
dans huit mois.
Dites-le-moi,
je vous présenterai un joli petit coin
près de l’Hippodrome. Des lofts. Superbes.
Tu me déçois, String.
J'avais des projets pour nous, merde.
Bonne journée, monsieur l’agent.
Tu as lu ça ?
Tu sais, ce môme abattu dans un parking
- à Lake Clifton, il y a quelques mois ?
- Un dealer, c'est ça ? Et alors ?
l’unique témoin oculaire a été retrouvé
hier soir
- dans une ruelle, criblé de balles.
- Et ?
Tu plaisantes ? C'est un témoin à charge.
Laisser tuer un témoin
dans une affaire aussi grave, c'est dire:
"La ville est perdue et on n'y peut rien."
- Effectivement, c'est un problème.
- Oublie la politique une minute.
Il faut qu'on soit tous en phase
sur ce sujet.
Je ne plaisante pas, Tony.
Si on laisse passer ce genre de truc,
on est vite foutus.
Tu veux faire porter le chapeau
publiquement au maire ?
Accuser Burrell et le procureur de l’État ?
Je ne vais accuser personne.
Je te répète d'oublier un peu la politique.
Mais on a un problème
et je vais tout faire pour le régler.
Tu prends ta cape et ton slip rouge
ou ils sont planqués
dans une cabine téléphonique ?
Ça m'a toujours intrigué.
- J'en ferais bien mon quatre heures.
- Tu les veux toutes.
- Ta mère, par exemple.
- Arrête de déconner.
C'est toi qui as commencé.
Elle a obligé notre gars à se découvrir.
Il nous vole,
et c'est sûrement à cause d'elle.
Lâchez pas la fille. Elle va pas tarder
à nous révéler son manège.
Hé, tu vas où ?
J'ai un truc à faire.
T'es censé rester ici
à poireauter avec nous.
Gardez la fille à l’œil.
Je vous rejoins plus tard.
- Ben voyons.
- J'ai un rendez-vous,
je dois y aller.
Il doit aller à un rendez-vous.
Ouais, il doit obéir à une gonzesse,
comme ce connard là-bas.
Encore une fois, d'après les données,
SERVICE STATISTIQUES DE BALTIMORE
- quand vole-t-on le plus de voitures ?
- La nuit, monsieur.
Et votre unité, qui je crois
est chargée de lutter
contre le vol d'automobiles,
quand travaille-t-elle ?
De jour, de 8 h à 16 h.
Mais, comme je vous disais...
Votre propos est clair.
Vous arrêtez plus de voleurs de voitures
le jour que la nuit.
On a des oreilles. On vous a tous entendu.
Ce qui me dépasse,
c'est pourquoi vous, vous n'entendez pas ?
Je ne...
Le préfet s'efforce
de faire entrer ce service moyenâgeux
dans le XXle siècle.
Il s'agit de lutter contre le crime grâce
au traitement informatique de données,
pas en s'appuyant
sur votre instinct à la mords-moi-le-nœud.
Combien de voitures volées
dans les parkings du centre-ville
les vendredis soirs ?
Il faut que je fasse une recherche.
On en est où avec le revolver ?
On m'a fait comprendre, colonel,
que retrouver l’arme
de l’agent Dozerman était une priorité.
On y travaille, monsieur.
Nous progressons déjà.
Lieutenant ?
Je me rends compte maintenant
qu'il faut miser sur la prévention
et nous allons modifier nos horaires
pour nous adapter aux données.
Bien, lieutenant.
C'est une loi constante.
Si tu dénonces les vrais coupables,
la merde te retombe sur la tête.
- Dennis, c'est ça ?
- Appelez-moi Cutty.
Bon, Cutty.
Il y aura que nous deux ?
- Je pensais que Grace...
- Sœur Grace vous a recommandé
mais je ne crois pas
qu'elle souhaitait être présente.
C'est une très belle femme.
Un homme dirait n'importe quoi
pour se rapprocher d'une femme comme ça.
Mais vous cherchez un emploi, je crois.
J'ai quelques questions.
Vous avez votre diplôme du secondaire ?
De l’expérience professionnelle ?
J'ai travaillé quelques mois
dans un entrepôt,
ça remonte à 1986.
Quelle aide attendez-vous de l’Église ?
M'aider à trouver du travail,
m'inscrire sur une liste, par exemple.
J'en sais rien.
Je vais être direct, nous ne faisons pas ça.
Si vous voulez un travail,
il faudra le gagner.
On vous aidera,
mais c'est à vous de faire des efforts.
La première chose à faire est de vous
inscrire à une mise à niveau scolaire.
Écoutez, sans vouloir vous vexer...
Je ne voyais pas ça comme ça.
Moi, Oscar, plusieurs des copains,
on l’a vu.
On pouvait pas l’éviter.
Ils sont pratiquement passés devant nous.
La victime, la fille, elle était armée.
Elle était avec qui ?
Aucune idée. Ça s'est passé trop vite.
Est-ce que l’un d'eux avait
une grosse cicatrice ?
Pensez-vous être capable
de reconnaître l’un de ces hommes ?
- Omar seulement.
- Vous connaissez Omar ?
Omar est venu par ici.
Bien, Malabar, bien.
- Vous savez qu'Omar a une cicatrice ?
- Ah bon ?
On va passer à mon bureau
mettre tout ça par écrit. Venez.
Excusez-moi, monsieur l’agent.
On est bien
au croisement North et Pulaski ?
Parce que j'aurais juré que Dozerman
s'était fait tirer dessus à ce croisement.
Non, non, attendez, je vais deviner.
La recherche de l’arme de votre camarade
a abouti à cet honnête citoyen.
Dites-moi, cher monsieur, savez-vous
où se trouve l’arme susmentionnée ?
C'est bien ce que je pensais.
Le centre de détention a appelé.
Des âmes charitables souhaitent t'aider
à te désembourber.
Laisse-moi interroger cet homme,
enregistrer son témoignage.
D'abord, l’arme. Le témoignage, après.
Ordre de ton sergent.
Hé, essuie-toi le nez.
- Eh, qu'est-ce...
- Oh, merde.
Putain, tu nous as fait flipper
à te pointer comme ça.
Ce truc te rend parano, mec.
- Allez, mec, goûte ça.
- Non, j'ai un test d'urine demain.
Quoi, ça t'inquiète ?
Vas-y, mec. On sait comment faire.
Oh, vous savez comment faire ?
Tu crois que t'es le seul connard
en liberté conditionnelle ?
- Allez, file-moi cette merde.
- J'aime mieux ça.
Bon. Elle a fait quoi aujourd'hui ?
Elle a pris un taxi
jusqu'au centre commercial,
braqué deux bijouteries
et ramené des sacs pleins.
Quand elle est sortie retrouver notre type,
elle portait déjà une partie de son butin
autour du cou.
- Elle lui a donné l’autre.
- "Ce qui est à elle est à lui", tu vois.
Ouais, Cutty. Elle est dans le coup.
Ça fait une semaine, McNulty.
T'as quelque chose contre Stringer,
oui ou non ?
Il a tenté de me vendre un appart.
L’enculé.
Encore un peu,
il adhère au Rotary et il se met au golf.
Il joue les chasseurs mais il est resté
du côté de la proie, je parie.
Stringer s'est rangé ?
M. Bell s'est reconverti dans la banque.
La banque ?
Une banque, c'est légal. Stringer dégage
un gros bénéfice honnêtement.
En même temps,
son argent finance du matos
auquel lui ne touchera jamais.
Il ne vend plus dans la rue.
Il se tient loin du quotidien des dealers.
l’argent récolté est blanchi au moyen
de placements légaux assez nombreux
pour qu'on perde sa trace.
Quand un criminel en arrive là,
il n'y a aucune chance
qu'un simple policier lui mette la main
au collet.
La vache.
Bon, Kintel Williamson,
le prince de Pimlico.
- On en est où avec lui ?
- On surveille quelques téléphones publics.
Ça te va ?
Parfait.
Tu nous aides, oui ou non ?
Ça sert à rien de prendre un flingue
si je dois rester à poireauter
dans une ruelle de merde.
C'est ta place.
Comme ça j'ai pas à craindre
qu'on me fasse sauter la cervelle
- parce que t'auras chié dans ton froc.
- Ça suffit.
Qu'est-ce que j'ai dit ? Ça suffit.
Pose tes fesses
et viens charger ce fusil. Kimmy !
Vous allez devoir vous y faire tous les deux
ou vous casser.
Et cette fois, on se plante pas.
C'est compris ?
Laisse tomber. Ça marchera jamais.
Tu l’as dit, la merde, ça retombe.
On a essayé les huiles.
Elles sont infoutues d'aider qui que ce soit.
Il faut se rapprocher des dealers.
Sergent,
il me faut la liste
de tous les petits revendeurs du secteur.
Pardon ?
Vous êtes des narcotiques, non ?
Je veux une liste de noms.
Peut-être que les stups ont un truc
comme ça. J'en sais rien.
On arrête les dealers, on les coffre.
Je savais pas qu'on devait les recenser.
Hé, m'dame. Où est le mec qui vend
des échantillons de pisse ? Merci.
Venez, c'est par là.
- Hé, mon pote a besoin de tester négatif.
- D'accord.
- 5 $ .
- Putain, c'était seulement 2 $ .
La pisse propre, c'est rare à Baltimore.
5 $ pièce.
- Qu'est-ce qui me dit qu'elle est propre ?
- Elle vient d'une garderie.
Je veux que tu enfournes le poulet à 190°.
Oui, et après,
tu m'aides à mettre ta sœur au lit...
Pardon, madame.
Posez votre pouce sur le lecteur.
Ne quitte pas.
- Quel est votre nom ?
- Wise, Dennis Wise.
Prenez un flacon. Deuxième porte à droite.
Non, tu ne sors pas.
Tu m'écoutes, oui ou non ?
Maj. George Smith.
Commandant, brigade des stupéfiants.
Voilà ce qu'on a sur les dealers
du quartier ouest
George. Ceci est un tout petit paquet
de feuilles.
Es-tu en train de me dire que vous ignorez
qui règne sur le quartier ouest ?
Rawls veut
que mes hommes fassent des rafles.
Si tu veux des infos à jour,
va voir les renseignements généraux.
- Ils m'envoient ici.
- Que veux-tu que je te dise ?
Trop de travail sur le terrain,
on n'a pas le temps de fignoler.
D'après mes sources,
ce type est venu à nous de son plein gré
et on l’a laissé tomber.
Dans cette ville,
un plan de protection se résume
à coller le type dans un motel
au bord de l’autoroute.
Sans surveillance, sans aide.
Sans rien. À part quelques fringues
et une brosse à dents.
- Seigneur.
- On traite pas comme ça celui qui coopère.
Je pourrais faire éclater tout ça
dans la presse.
Mais à quoi bon, ça servirait juste
à rendre tout le monde nerveux
sans rien résoudre.
- J'ai préféré venir vous en parler.
- D'accord.
Quelle est notre position ?
Vous avez convoqué une réunion
sur le sujet avec le procureur
et le préfet de police.
Elle est prévue mercredi prochain.
Non, Tommy a raison. Il faut faire vite.
Je suis heureux que vous soyez venu.
Je vais agir, croyez-moi.
Bien, merci.
- Vous me tenez au courant, hein ?
- Absolument. M. Le conseiller.
Doucement, ma jolie, faut qu'on parle.
- Ouais, mon cœur.
- On se connaît ?
- Non, mais ça peut s'arranger.
- Dans ce cas, veuillez m'excuser.
- On veut juste discuter, chérie.
- Écartez-vous, merde.
Écoute, poupée, on veut juste...
T'es sourd ou t'es seulement con ?
- Bon, attends, tout ce qu'on veut...
- Waou !
Putain.
Maintenant, on peut discuter.
Comment cette unité minuscule fait-elle
pour posséder tous ces renseignements
sur la drogue ?
J'ai fait la tournée des services
en trouvant que dalle
et vous, vous me sortez ça.
Vous savez, avec quelques écoutes
on remplit vite une armoire.
C'est parfait. Merci.
Putain ! Ça alors !
On m'avait dit que t'avais atterri ici.
C'est moi qui ai formé ce gamin.
J'ai fait plus de demandes d'identification
pour Tignasse
que pour toute l’équipe réunie.
Enfin, jusqu'à ce qu'il se grille.
Tu en es où maintenant, McNulty ?
1911, South Clinton, au premier étage.
Voyez-vous ça.
Ouais. Il faut le serrer de près, c'est vrai,
mais ça reste un sacré bon policier.
Qu'est-ce qui vous amène par chez nous ?
J'essaie de savoir qui dirige le deal
dans mon secteur.
Mes narcos ne parlent que d'arrestations
et le commandant n'a pas été plus utile.
- Mais vous tous ici m'avez sauvé la mise.
- Tu lui as parlé de ton pote Marlo ?
Les dossiers en parlent, avec les autres
intermédiaires qu'on connaît.
Est-ce que je peux vous demander
ce que vous allez faire de ça, major ?
Eh bien,
chacun de ces jeunes gens
aura un agent du service statistiques
aux fesses.
Messieurs. Madame. Tignasse.
Tignasse ?
RÉUSSIR, ÇA SE PRÉPARE
BIENVENUE - COOPÉRATIVE NEW DAY
Bon, le règlement.
On respecte la réputation
des gars de Veronica Avenue.
Bon, écoute, on a fait le tour
de cette putain de question, non ?
- On vote, oui ou non ?
- Rick a raison.
Très bien.
Ceux qui sont pour qu'on se regroupe
et qu'on négocie un meilleur prix
sur le matos de New York, levez la main.
- D'accord.
- Et voilà.
On va donc se faire du fric ensemble.
Je suis fier
que vous ayez mis de côté vos querelles
et permis de mettre ça sur pied.
Putain, pour des gangsters sans morale,
vous avez agi en républicains, merde.
Oublie pas, mec, parle de ça autour de toi.
Le meilleur moyen d'avancer,
c'est de faire connaître
à tous les avantages de ce système.
On fait des affaires, sans conflits,
sans violence.
Si vous avez à vous plaindre
d'un autre membre du groupe,
on règle ça entre nous. Pas dans la rue.
Très bien. C'est parti.
- Génial.
- Ouais.
Putain, c'est quoi, ça ?
Il paraît qu'il faut un compte rendu
des réunions, non ?
C'est le compte rendu.
Putain, t'es en train de prendre des notes
sur une association de malfaiteurs ?
À quoi tu penses, merde ?
- C'est génial.
- Papa, il triche.
Michael, sois gentil avec ton frère.
Comment ça se passe entre vous
et le nouveau copain de maman ?
- Dennis. Il est là depuis longtemps.
- Bon, comment ça se passe ?
Maman veut pas qu'on te parle
de trucs de famille.
Tu viendras à la journée portes ouvertes ?
J'essaierai.
J'ai pas mal de boulot en ce moment.
- Des nouvelles affaires.
- Maman dit qu'il faut que tu viennes.
Ouais, tous les autres pères seront là.
Attrape ses jambes.
- Alors, tu nous voles, enculé ?
- Prends la bague, aussi.
- Elle veut pas venir, merde.
- Lâche-le.
Ce type bosse pour nous, vous savez.
Si vous continuez de le frapper comme ça,
il sera plus capable de grand-chose
pour nous rembourser.
Cet enculé doit payer.
- Allez, mec, fouille ses poches.
- Ouais.
- Ce mec est à moi.
- Casse-toi, putain ! Dégage !
Quoi de neuf, mon pote ?
Putain, je me tape 26 mois
et j'ai droit qu'à une Ford pourrie ?
Je déconne. Ça va, mon pote ?
Ça roule ?
Je suis content d'être sorti
de cette saloperie. Tu sais quoi ?
De l’autre côté de cette porte,
c'est écrit: "Plus jamais."
Et putain, c'est la seule chose
que je veux emporter avec moi.
Doucement. Commençons par ton allure.
Tu veux bien ?
Putain, j'adore. Oh, oui. Merci, mec.
Commencez par le secteur 1.
D'ici la fin de la journée,
amenez-en un maximum sur Vincent Street.
Pas de fourgonnettes.
Entassez-les dans vos bagnoles.
Les plus jeunes veulent rien entendre.
Pourquoi ceux-là nous écouteraient ?
Ce sont des superviseurs,
ils surveillent les points de vente,
et je comprends leur douleur.
Être cadre moyen,
c'est avoir juste assez de responsabilités
pour être obligé d'écouter les autres,
mais pas assez
pour les envoyer se faire foutre.
Écoute, le major veut seulement te parler.
Rien de plus, promis.
- On te ramène juste après.
- Vous pouvez vous asseoir dessus.
Qu'est-ce que t'as dit, petit con ?
Ça veut dire quoi, qu'on s'assied dessus ?
Je vais te dire, connard.
On a ordre de ramener ton cul minable
à notre chef pour qu'il te parle.
Et on a l’intention
de le ramener tout de suite.
- Soit on fait ça gentiment...
- Pauvres connards débiles.
À toi de voir.
<i>- Allô.
- Prez, c'est moi.</i>
On a un petit problème. Reste à l’écoute.
Prêt à intervenir.
Quand le major veut voir les cons, tu y vas.
Laisse courir pour cette fois.
T'es sûr ? Si tu veux, il y va.
Une autre fois, Herc.
On doit faire ce qu'a dit le major.
Souviens-toi de moi, face de con.
Je reviendrai demain.
<i>- Tu veux que j’appelle le central ?
- Non, ça va. Je te raconterai.</i>
On appelle des renforts et on fait leur fête
à ces enculés.
- Allez, on continue.
- Arrête, Tommy, c'est qu'un jeu.
Il t' a donné ce que tu voulais, non ?
Je parle du maire.
Ouais, il est capable
de me mener en bateau.
Mais tu peux me croire,
s'il foire ce truc,
je me le fais. En grand.
- Sérieux ?
- Tu peux me croire.
S'il continue à m'éviter,
je le plante pour de bon.
Ça, c'est le bon côté.
Ce que j'appelle la carotte.
Si vous rassemblez vos gars
dans une des zones que j'ai désignées,
vous ne risquerez aucune arrestation
ni aucune poursuite.
Vous pouvez faire vos livraisons,
récupérer ce que vous voulez,
personne ira vous embêter.
Vous avez ma parole.
- Ça vous rapporte quoi ?
- Bonne question.
Je veux sauver ce qu'il reste à sauver
dans mon secteur.
Pour ça, je veux éviter
que des petits dealers se baladent
en faisant peur aux honnêtes gens.
Ces mômes ne m'écouteront pas,
mais ils vous écouteront, vous.
Si vous leur dites de bouger
et de s'installer là, ils le feront.
Alors, mon plan, c'est: Je vous aide,
- vous m'aidez.
- Non, c'est un piège.
Vérifiez la zone, allez-y.
Y a pas de caméras, pas de micros, rien.
Tous les flics que vous voyez resteront
au bord de la zone.
Pour éviter toute violence, c'est tout.
Vous pouvez vérifier.
Vous verrez si je ne tiens pas parole.
Le prenez pas mal, chef,
- mais il se passe quoi si on refuse ?
- Au début, j'ai parlé d'une carotte.
Mais si vous choisissez le bâton,
vous le sentirez passer
comme jamais dans votre vie.
On arrêtera tous les revendeurs,
tous les jours.
J'ai plus de 200 agents assermentés
et j'ai l’intention de tous les utiliser
à vous faire tomber un par un.
Un revendeur pris dans mon secteur
pourra oublier les infractions mineures,
il ne s'agira pas de vagabondage
ou autre chose de ce genre.
Il vous arrivera des pépins
autrement plus sérieux
avant même le panier à salade.
Vous saisissez ?
Et pendant que vous refusez l’arrangement,
d'autres plus malins
seront ici, à se faire un fric délirant.
Pensez-y un peu.
Mais croyez-moi, d'ici lundi
votre monde et le mien auront changé.
Tu avais dit
que ces putains de maisons étaient vides.
- On a dû oublier celle-là.
- Alors, il me reste une chose à faire.
Un mec, petit, secteur B,
un de ses gars dans le dortoir,
son frère est pote avec la copine
du type qui a tiré sur le flic.
Le petit dit:
"Si tu nous fais évader tous les trois,
"je peux la faire parler."
Vous savez, pour trouver le flingue.
Alors, j'apprends que c'est ce Dink
qui a le flingue du type.
Mais je sais pas de quel Dink il parle,
si c'est Dink Dink ou Inky Dink,
ou même Fat Dink.
Ça peut même être Flatnose Dink.
Non, remarque.
Non, c'est pas possible, celui-là est mort.
Écoutez, je peux vous aider.
Si vous faites sauter ces saloperies
d'accusations de meurtres.
Bon. Il s'agit de combien de meurtres ?
Écoutez, vous voulez absolument le flingue
du flic ?
Parce que si c'est un flingue
que vous voulez, je peux en trouver un.
Ça me revient. La sixième.
Le cours de bio de Mme Holley.
Les casse-croûtes au goût infect.
Mec, ça doit être important,
tu passes pas par le circuit normal.
Non, enfin, j'en sais rien.
J'ai pensé que si j'en parlais à d'autres,
tu croirais que je suis défoncé.
Qu'est-ce qui me prouve le contraire ?
C'est vrai. T'as raison.
Bon, aujourd'hui,
je suis avec Tuckie et Little Mikey,
enfin tout le monde,
la police nous rassemble presque tous.
Oui, c'est pas bien de vendre de la drogue.
D'accord, d'accord.
Mais ils nous embarquent pas au poste.
Ils nous emmènent sur Vincent Street,
là où les maisons sont condamnées,
et ils nous font sortir.
En plus, pendant tout ce temps, mec,
ils arrêtent pas d'être
carrément polis et tout ça,
c'est flippant, tu vois.
Et après, tu vois, le chef de la police,
il se pointe
et là, c'est dingue,
il dit qu'il s'est arrangé
pour qu'on puisse vendre de la came
à certains endroits,
que la police viendra pas nous emmerder.
Je sais, je sais. Ça a l’air dingue,
mais j'ai pensé que ça t'intéresserait.
- C'est tout ?
- Ouais, ça et ce type, Marlo.
Oui, je suis dessus.
Ouais.
23-03 au central.
Passe-moi Foxtrot sur le six, Adam.
<i>- Foxtrot à l’écoute.
- 23-03 à Foxtrot.</i>
<i>- Foxtrot, prêt à intervenir.
- Une Mercedes noire, elle sort du parking.</i>
<i>Bien reçu, on l’a à l’œil.</i>
C'est là ?
Tuckie dit qu'on est censés vendre ici.
- À Hamsterdam.
- Oui, c'est là.
Installez-vous où vous voulez
là où il y a des drapeaux blancs.
- Bon, je me tire.
- Tu viens d'arriver. Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Y a personne à qui vendre.
Il a raison.
- Il manque les clients.
- À mon avis...
Non. Tu peux pas me demander ça.
Je suis un policier assermenté, merde.
Salut, mec. T'as de la Body Bag ?
File-m'en deux.
Les stups.
- Laisse tomber, connard.
- Fais voir le fric, grouille.
Putain, tu déconnes.
Tu m'as serré avant que j'aie la came.
C'est quoi, cette règle à la con ?
T'appelles, on rapplique.
T'as des trucs sur toi ?
Bien sûr que non.
Ce con de bleu m'a pas laissé
toucher la came.
Ce point de vente est fermé.
Tu bouges sur Vincent Street
ou on revient avec les menottes.
<i>Quelqu’un peut aller...</i>
<i>- T’as quoi ?
- On se voit au coin de Riggs et Calhoun.</i>
<i>Malgré des retards imprévus,</i>
<i>nous entamerons une formation en janvier,</i>
<i>nous serons donc prêts
pour l’année prochaine.</i>
<i>Merci, monsieur le préfet.</i>
<i>Je demande l’autorisation
de poser quelques questions.</i>
<i>Monsieur le préfet,
vous n’ignorez pas qu’un témoin à charge</i>
<i>dans un procès pour homicide
a été tué récemment.</i>
<i>Nous donnons toute priorité à cette affaire.</i>
<i>La criminelle a mis sur pied une équipe</i>
<i>et les stups cuisinent leurs informateurs.</i>
<i>Nous avons aussi demandé le soutien
du F.B.I. Et des narcotiques.</i>
<i>Sans vouloir vous mettre de pression,
vous devez admettre</i>
<i>que c’est un peu arriver après la bataille.</i>
<i>Car le garçon abattu sur un parking
du lycée de Lake Clifton,</i>
<i>c’était une affaire importante, n’est-ce pas ?</i>
<i>En effet.</i>
LAISSE TOMBER
<i>Vous aviez un témoin clé
dans cette affaire... Un instant.</i>
<i>Pardon, monsieur le préfet,
le président me rappelait</i>
<i>que vous êtes attendu d’urgence.</i>
<i>Si cela vous convient, nous reprendrons
cette discussion plus tard.</i>
<i>La séance est levée.</i>
Conseiller Thomas J. Carcetti.
Tu as vu, Burrell était en nage.
- Son col était trempé.
- Qu'est-ce qui t'a pris ?
C'est toi, mon vieux. C'est toi.
Terminus, tout le monde descend.
Hé, j'ai de la Rockefeller.
J'ai de la Rockefeller, par ici.
- Par ici pour la Rockefeller, mec.
- Putain de merde.
Hé, par ici, la Rockefeller.
Destruction massive assurée ? J'en ai.
- La D.M. A, c'est le top, il paraît.
- La destruction massive assurée. Par ici.
La D.M.A.
Donne-m'en deux, mec.
La D.M.A. Par ici.
La D.M.A., par ici. Par ici.
Par ici.
- J'ai de la Rockefeller, par ici.
- Ouais.
J'ai de la Rockefeller, mec.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Prends les jumelles, par terre.
- Marlo bouge ?
- Regarde.
Fais pas gaffe à ce que Bodie t'a dit.
C'est pas à propos de la bagarre.
T'es malin, ça se voit tout de suite.
Je voulais un coin tranquille
pour qu'on discute.
Mais, putain,
il y a que les mouchards
qui peuvent vivre ici.
C'est bien, d'être malin,
mais ça suffit pas à ce jeu-là, tu sais.
T'étudies en histoire ?
Tu sais que cette ville a eu son lot
de criminels doués ?
Melvin, Little Wil, Big Head Brother,
Peanut, Warren.
Tous des malins, mec, vraiment malins.
Mais dès qu'ils ont commencé
à faire parler d'eux,
le F.B.I. S'est mis sur leur dos.
Tu comprends ?
Le gouvernement veut pas
qu'on s'organise. Il veut
qu'on se batte et qu'on se trucide
dans la rue pour des conneries.
Moi pas.
C'est pour ça que moi et Prop Joe,
on a voulu monter cette coopérative.
Le même matos pour tous les gangs.
La meilleure came, héro et coke.
Tout le monde partage.
- J'en ai entendu parler.
- T'en as entendu parler ?
Bien. C'est un début.
Tu sais, mec, la Mercedes que tu conduis,
que t'as mise au nom de ta tante
ou je sais pas quoi ?
Quand ils te choperont,
ces signes de richesse
te feront tomber, mon pote.
C'est comme ça.
Ils se servent de ton argent contre toi.
J'imagine que toi,
avec le nombre de tes points de vente,
- tu te fais pas loin du million de dollars ?
- Je me débrouille.
Tu te débrouilles, mais pas assez
pour avoir le droit d'être proprio, hein ?
Pas assez pour avoir un endroit à toi
où blanchir tout cet argent sale.
Avec moi, tu l’auras.
- Allez, dis-moi avec qui il est ?
- Je t'ai dit d'observer.
C'est Bunk qui t'a rencardée ?
Écoute, je te parie une caisse de cette pisse
que tu appelles bière
contre un litre de whiskey
qu'il s'est tiré par-derrière
et que tu surveilles cette baraque pour rien.
Tiens, ton rien se pointe.
Oh non !
J'aime boire ma pisse dans une bouteille.
Comme tu voudras, chérie.
Chris. Dis à nos gars de s'équiper.
J'y vais.
J'ai de la D.M.A. De la D.M.A.
J'ai de la D.M.A. De la D.M.A.
Ils s'habituent plutôt vite.
- Ouais, ils en ont rien à foutre de nous.
- Les revendeurs l’ont baptisé Hamsterdam.
Comme Amsterdam.
Hamsterdam.
JOURNÉE PORTES OUVERTES
...des notions de maths intégrées:
Le raisonnement algébrique,
les suites, la géométrie ou les probabilités.
Impressionnant.
Nous nous efforçons de conserver
des classes de moins de 12 élèves.
- Et il y a trois niveaux ?
- Oui, de sorte que...
Pardon, je suis Jim McNulty.
Je suis en retard, j'ai été retenu au boulot.
M. McNulty.
J'ai des doutes
au sujet des maths intégrées.
Dans d'autres écoles,
Michael a suivi une introduction à l’algèbre,
mais cette école semble avoir
une approche différente.
- Oui. Le programme de maths intégrées...
- J'ai soif.
Je te ramène quelque chose à boire ?
Notre programme
de maths intégrées consiste...
Pas très varié, mais j'accorde une mention
au yaourt bulgare.
Vulgaire ?
Désolé. Je sors du boulot,
je n'ai pas pu me changer.
C'est pas une raison pour m'insulter.
- Que faites-vous, M...
- Je siège au conseil de Legg Mason.
- Jim McNulty.
- Legg Mason.
Ou alors je suis flic. J'oublie tout le temps.
Terri D'Agostino.
Je suis une ancienne élève de cette école
et une éminente donatrice.
Des cours particuliers sont proposés
avec le programme de maths.
Alors, si Michael a un peu de mal à suivre,
je peux lui donner des cours
le mardi et le jeudi.
- Que dites-vous de cette école ?
- Elle est bien.
Bien.
Mon ex-femme et moi envisageons
d'y inscrire nos fils.
- Vous avez des réticences ?
- Non, pas vraiment.
Enfin si, il y a ce programme d'intégration
des maths pour l’aîné.
Il est en sixième ou en cinquième
et je crois qu'il est un peu tôt
pour toutes ces maths, vous voyez.
- Doucement, je suis qu'un paysan.
- Ferme-la.
- Hé, chéri, contente de te revoir.
- Comment ça va ?
- Ça va, mon pote ?
- Comment tu vas ?
Bienvenue chez toi.
Salut, sœurette.
J'aurais juste aimé ne pas revenir seul,
tu sais.
Je sais.
Amuse-toi, ce soir. On en parlera plus tard.
- Bienvenue.
- Alors, Prop ? Ça va, mon pote ?
Ça va. T'as l’air en forme.
Ouais, j'ai fait du sport en taule.
T'as que ça à faire, du sport.
C'est peut-être le lieu de vacances idéal
pour un obèse.
Hé. Il y a là des costards-cravates
qui meurent d'envie de te voir.
Des costards-cravates,
quand j'essaie d'attraper une jupe.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Tu ferais mieux de t'habiller.
Je dois travailler.
J'ai une longue journée demain.
Je serai très sage.
Qui sait ?
Tu pourrais en avoir marre de travailler.
Je dois travailler.
Tu dois partir.
Stringer a vraiment transformé ce coin
de la ville, Avon,
c'est difficile de dire jusqu'où ira le profit
quand le réaménagement urbain
se pointera.
Tout Howard Street va s'envoler
et tu dois être là
pour prendre ta part du gâteau.
Chaque dollar investi maintenant
te rapportera 10 fois plus.
Et surtout, je sais
que tu veux pas retourner dans la rue.
Pas après ce que t'as vécu.
Je le sais, moi aussi je viens de la rue.
Et dès que j'ai eu l’occasion
de changer de registre,
ça n'a fait aucun doute dans mon esprit.
Et puis,
le gouvernement va te surveiller de près.
À quoi bon leur donner ce qu'ils veulent ?
Investis, construis l’avenir.
Ça me va.
Arrangez un rendez-vous. On en rediscute.
Hé, Slim. Tu vois ces deux mecs là-bas ?
Lls sont défoncés,
ils en ont rien à foutre de ce qui se passe.
Putain, y a plus de discipline, hein ?
Fais chier, vire-les.
Je peux te parler ?
T'as pas le droit de me regarder comme ça.
Hé, mon pote.
J'ai quelque chose à te montrer.
Excuse-moi, ma jolie.
Putain, mec.
Tu sais que j'ai été en taule, merde.
Tu vas adorer. Fais-moi confiance.
Ah ouais.
D'enfer !
Putain, ça change de ma piaule à Jessup.
Mais bon, c'est normal, hein ?
C'est tout à toi, B. Tout, à ton nom.
Tu me suis ? Ce bout de papier prouve
que tout est en règle.
Les clés de la Navigator garée
dans le parking.
Elle est louée,
le temps que tu trouves ce qui te plaît.
Putain, tout ça ?
T'as pas déconné.
Je me suis dit
qu'on se faisait plein de fric légalement
et qu'on pouvait en montrer un peu,
l’assumer.
Hé, tu te souviens quand on se perchait
sur le toit du 734 de la rue,
qu'on matait la ville
en parlant de ce qu'on deviendrait ?
Tu étais obsédé par ces conneries
de fierté noire,
tu parlais d'avoir deux épiceries
pour que ta mère soit fière.
Ouais, mec, et toi, tu brandissais un AK-47
en répétant: "Je vais faire la guerre."
Putain !
Ouais.
- On est frères, B.
- Pour la vie, mon pote.
Pour la vie.
Encore un truc, mec. Tu vois,
je veux pas avoir l’air trop exigeant,
surtout après tout ce que t'as fait pour moi,
mais bon, j'étais en taule.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
Bon, écoute. Je dois aller à une réunion.
- Tu sais...
- Je t'appelle. Bienvenue chez toi.
Hé, c'est moi. J'ai oublié un truc.
Putain. T'es un vrai pote.
De la bonne came.
Destruction massive assurée.
Faut continuer.
- C'est pas beau à voir.
- C'est pas fait pour être beau.
Faut juste les virer des zones
qu'on peut encore sauver.
Bon, j'ai prévenu les autres équipes,
je vous préviens aussi.
À la fin de la semaine,
je veux voir des rues propres.
Ils viennent ici, dans les deux autres zones
de non-droit,
ou alors vous les matraquez.
Faites ce qui est nécessaire.
Si ça veut dire
que des types doivent y passer,
vous aurez mon soutien. Compris ?
J'ai affecté notre agent de l’I.G.S.
À la section de tirs toute la semaine.
Le lieutenant Mello s'occupera
des plaintes de citoyens.
Tout ce qui est nécessaire.
Putain, j'ai rien fait. J'ai des droits.
Contente-toi
de ton droit à garder le silence.
Ça se passe pas comme ça à Hamsterdam.
On me coffre parce que je traîne ici ?
Allez vous faire foutre. On est en Amérique.
À Baltimore ouest.
Je vous jure, agent Herc,
si vous me rendez ma beauté,
on ira où vous voulez.
Sur la tête de ma mère.
Pour qu'un type t'écoute,
faut s'en prendre à sa tire.
- Sa beauté ?
- Hé, attendez !
Connard ! Vous allez avoir des nouvelles
de mon avocat.
- Putain, vous avez pas le droit !
- Tu crois ça ?
Allez tous vous faire foutre !
Messieurs.
Ça, on n'a pas le droit de le faire.
C'est bon.
Allez, mon chéri.
Bouge ton cul.
On est encore dans le Maryland.
Mais si vous allez pas
à Hamsterdam demain,
la prochaine fois, ce sera la Virginie.
Vous voyez la petite étoile
en face de la Grande Ourse ? C'est le nord.
Vous, vous allez dans l’autre sens.
Trouducs.

"Je crois que je reste un gangster."
- Avon Barksdale
De la bonne came.
Destruction massive assurée.
J'ai de la dope, j'en ai.
De la bonne came.
Destruction massive assurée.
On a tout ce qui faut. De la bonne came.
On commence les travaux intérieurs
cette semaine.
On va donc réviser le budget.
C'est-à-dire ?
Le prix de l’acier a doublé.
Il ne tardera pas à tripler.
- On l’a pas encore acheté ?
- Il en manque.
Et les frais de tout-à-l’égout,
plus élevés que prévu.
Il faut qu'il porte son casque
sur le chantier. Mesure de sécurité.
Le tout-à-l’égout a augmenté ?
À cause de tes modifications.
Dans les lofts.
- Il faut de nouveaux permis.
- Et un délai supplémentaire.
Sauf si on accélère tout ça.
On fait venir l’architecte
ce week-end et ça part lundi.
- C'est pas compris dans les frais ?
- Non, c'est un imprévu.
C'est vous qui avez merdé.
Donc c'est vous qui allez rallonger.
Pardon ?
Lui, le tout-à-l’égout,
c'est pas son problème.
Le prix de l’acier non plus.
Il veut juste faire construire un truc.
C'est vous qui êtes censés être les experts.
Mais apparemment,
l’expertise laisse un peu à désirer.
Malheureusement, M. Barksdale, les
dépassements de budget sont fréquents.
Déjeunons ensemble pour en discuter.
Ça va pas être possible, il faut que j'y aille.
C'est le jeune Marlo,
du sang neuf dans la partie.
Bell lui a filé les meilleurs spots.
Le gang de Barksdale s'est servi
quand les tours sont tombées.
Stringer n'a pas perdu de temps.
- Ils dealent toujours ?
- Plus que jamais.
Il ne flingue personne.
Normal. Il a déjà
toutes les rues dont il a besoin.
Que voulez-vous que ça me fasse ?
Lieutenant, pendant deux semaines,
Bell a eu l’air propre,
comme s'il pouvait se contenter
d'une couverture légale.
Kima a découvert
qu'il avait encore un pied dans la drogue.
Sinon, pourquoi aurait-il
rencontré Stanfield ?
Il est encore impliqué
dans les deals quotidiens.
Dans six ou huit mois,
on pourra plus prouver qu'il deale.
C'est maintenant ou jamais.
Stringer Bell se tient tranquille.
Tant que c'est le cas,
je me fiche que dans un an,
il fasse partie
du conseil municipal de Baltimore.
Nous, on s'occupe des homicides.
<i>Major Foerster, faites le 2462.
Major Foerster.</i>
C'est quoi, ce truc ?
Pour retrouver l’arme de service
de Dozerman.
Envoie-le au commandement,
ils te ficheront la paix un moment.
T'as vraiment fait tout ça ?
Qu'est-ce que ça changerait ?
Jay, j'enquête sur les meurtres,
j'ai un double homicide à élucider.
Je vais m'y atteler.
On n'est pas non plus sur Fayette
et Poppleton. Pourquoi ?
Je m'en occupe. Des avenues aussi.
Comment ça, tu t'en occupes ?
Pourquoi on n'a même pas un revendeur
dans cette rue ?
- On en avait un.
- Y a eu un problème.
- Il a chassé nos gars.
- Qui ça ?
- Un mec...
- Écoute.
Laisse-le parler. Il est là pour régler ça.
- Marlo.
- Marlo. C'est qui, celui-là ?
Il est avec un des gangs ?
C'est un jeune. Il a son propre business.
Il a peut-être quinze spots
entre ici et l’avenue.
Un type indépendant sans soutien
qui a les meilleurs endroits,
et nous on fait quoi ?
Ce petit jeune nous a chassés de la rue ?
Ça me rend dingue.
Je ne voudrais pas
manquer de respect à votre fille,
mais Tosha n'a pas été tuée
parce qu'elle passait là par hasard.
Tout le monde le sait, non ?
Elle était impliquée, on en est sûrs.
On sait qu'elle avait une arme
au moment des faits.
On ne l’a jamais retrouvée,
mais ça veut juste dire
que quelqu'un l’a prise.
Votre fille était bien mêlée
à tout ce qui se tramait.
Je me trompe ?
Des témoins de la scène l’ont vue
participer à un vol de drogue.
Il y avait aussi un certain Omar.
Personne n'a dit que Tosha était un ange.
Personne ne dit ça.
Mais que disent les gens ?
Le gang de Tosha
n'est peut-être pas à l’origine
du tir qui l’a tuée,
mais ils ont intérêt
à me dire la vérité rapidement,
sinon, leur liberté risque d'être compromise
jusqu'à l’arrivée des cigales.
Transmettez le message
aux personnes concernées.
K. REMNICK - Procureur adjointe
Comté Anne Arundel
Vous avez vu le légiste ?
Qu'en pense-t-il ?
- Il dit que c'est louche.
- Louche ?
Si une enquête mène
à un scénario plausible,
il veut bien transformer ce décès
en homicide.
Vous avez un suspect ?
Non.
J'ignore comment ça se passe en ville,
mais à Annapolis,
on essaie d'éviter les ennuis.
Pas de les provoquer.
Mon comté n'a pas besoin
d'un autre meurtre.
BIENVENUE ! Delta Phi Gamma
Gala pour la lutte contre le SIDA
Ravie que vous ayez pu venir.
Mesdames, révérend Wright,
je vous présente mon mari,
- Cédric Daniels.
- Enchanté.
- Pas que je sache.
- Mais elle était invitée, non ?
Bien sûr. Eunetta ne sort plus beaucoup.
Même pour les réunions du conseil.
Elle va être débordée,
avec les élections primaires.
Le maire l’aidera.
- Il est toujours influent ?
- Plutôt.
Cherche le mot "représentant’
dans le dictionnaire
et tu verras Clarence Royce
te faire un grand sourire.
Il gardera son équipe au grand complet.
Un nouveau sondage sur le maire
montre que sa cote de popularité
est en chute libre depuis un an.
Il n'est pas près de publier
un communiqué à ce sujet.
Apparemment, vous l’avez pris en grippe
concernant le meurtre du témoin.
Pas le maire directement.
Mais toutes les huiles de la police
sont passées devant le sous-comité,
ce qui s'est passé est inexcusable.
Continuez comme ça.
Une petite claque de temps en temps,
ça ne leur fait pas de mal.
C'est pour ça
que le conseil a besoin de sang neuf.
Pour que tout le monde reste intègre.
Oui.
Oui. Une bière light.
Ne va pas te ridiculiser.
Bon.
Le meurtre ne sera jamais considéré
comme tel
et Daniels a d'autres chats à fouetter.
Je sais.
Tu sais ce qui est le plus dur,
quand on est flic ?
Oui. Convaincre ta femme
qu'elle doit suivre un traitement
pour ta propre infection urinaire.
J'allais dire:
Donner un sens à ce qu'on fait.
Ça aussi, c'est dur.
- En parlant d'ex-femme, quoi de neuf ?
- Rien.
Elle a mis le grappin sur un avocat.
Un type friqué.
Qu'ils aillent se faire foutre.
Tu tournes la page ?
Oui. D'ailleurs, j'ai peut-être une ouverture.
Vraiment ?
Une nana que j'ai rencontrée
à l’école de mes enfants.
Elle lève des fonds pour l’école,
ce genre de trucs.
Son visage, son corps et sa cervelle
sont bien coordonnés.
Du genre à me dire qu'il est temps
que je change de chemise,
je crois que j'ai besoin de ça.
C'est une espèce de Freamon
avec des seins.
- Elle t'a filé son numéro ?
- Pas vraiment.
Je ferais un bien piètre inspecteur
si je n'arrivais pas à retrouver une Blanche
à Baltimore, non ?
Bien dit.
Demande-lui ce qu'elle veut.
Tu as été parfait, ce soir.
Ils te mangeaient dans la main.
C'est ce que tu voulais, non ?
C'est vrai, ça s'est pas mal passé.
Je dois sans doute m'améliorer.
Tu t'améliores.
Cédric, on pourrait peut-être...
Je ne sais pas.
Pour l’instant, tu me dis
quand tu as besoin de moi,
si je dois porter tel ou tel uniforme,
et j'arrive.
Je ne sais pas
si je suis prêt à aller plus loin.
Alors ?
Alors ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on en a à foutre ?
Réfléchis bien.
Prends ton temps.
Si tu prends cette décision,
on sera en guerre. Ce sera la guerre.
J'ai toujours été là.
Avant, ça ne se passait pas comme ça.
On va pas commencer à payer
pour pouvoir être dans la rue.
Depuis quand on achète des rues ?
Les rues, on les prend.
D'une façon ou d'une autre, on paiera.
Que ce soit avec les cadavres
ou le temps perdu
en prison, hier et demain.
Faut se salir les mains dans ce boulot,
mais pas pour rien.
On a besoin de combien de rues ?
- Un black, ça gagne combien ?
- Plus qu'il peut dépenser.
On sera plus là
pour dépenser ce qu'on a gagné.
Putain, je pensais pas
que je durerais aussi longtemps.
Ouais, eh ben, on est encore là.
On a tous les gangs de la ville:
Ceux de l’est, ceux de l’ouest,
on bosse ensemble sur le même territoire
pour vendre la bonne came
que Prop Joe nous fournit.
On la vend,
on investit cet argent dans l’immobilier
et personne ne va en taule.
On n'en est plus aux petits coups foireux.
On se trouve de la dope
et on ne pense qu'aux dollars.
Il n'y a que la thune.
Plus de rues, de territoires, rien.
On a tellement d'argent propre
que le gouvernement
ne peut rien nous reprocher.
Des hommes d'affaires, hein ?
On laisse les jeunes s'occuper
de la vente au détail
et de la vente en gros.
On se fiche de savoir
qui est dans quelle rue
du moment qu'on écoule la dope,
qu'on la fait circuler
et qu'elle nous rapporte.
On vaut mieux que ça, B. Point final.
Comme Little Willie,
à l’époque des loteries illégales,
on pourrait diriger cette putain de ville.
Comme des hommes d'affaires.
Je vais parler avec ce Marlo.
Pour voir si on peut calmer le jeu.
Ça va prendre du temps,
parce que ce black est têtu.
Mais je crois que je pourrais le convaincre.
Je suis pas un homme d'affaires
tiré à quatre épingles comme toi.
Je crois que je reste un gangster.
Et je veux récupérer mes rues.
<i>Tu sais, j’ai du mal</i>
<i>à me faire à l’idée
que tu vas être en liberté conditionnelle.</i>
<i>Moi, je ne réaliserai que lorsque je siroterai
mon premier martini.</i>
La crim est allée voir la famille de Tosha.
Ils ont dit
qu'ils savaient qu'elle était impliquée.
Qu'ils avaient des témoins.
Ils ont aussi mentionné ton nom.
- Et alors ?
- Ils m'ont appelée.
- Hé, mais je le connais, ce keuf.
- Ah ouais ?
On devrait peut-être l’aider.
Lui dire qui a fait quoi.
Arrête tes conneries, Kimmy.
J'ai dit que je m'en occupais.
Sa famille veut savoir
ce qui s'est passé ce jour-là. C'est tout.
Dis-leur qu'elle essayait
de flinguer ces types.
C'est pas la peine
de mettre la police sur le coup.
J'ai l’impression
qu'ils sont déjà sur le coup.
Kimmy, j'ai dit que je m'en occupais.
Mon mari travaillait pour M. Cooper
à la conserverie American Can.
Il gagnait bien sa vie.
On a économisé pour acheter cette maison.
À l’époque, il y avait encore
des familles blanches dans le quartier.
Le quartier a beaucoup changé, Mme Hazel.
Voici une photo de la maison.
Ah.
Elle appartient à la ville, tous frais payés.
Elle est très jolie.
Mais c'est au-dessus de mes moyens.
Ne vous inquiétez pas pour l’argent.
On s'occupe de tout.
C'est un de nos programmes spéciaux.
Destiné aux gens qui vivent
dans des conditions vraiment difficiles
à cause des trafics de drogue dans la rue.
C'est un quartier agréable.
Vous y serez en sécurité
et la ligne 19 y passe.
Vous pourrez aller à l’église à pied.
Monsieur l’agent, j'ai toujours vécu ici.
C'est tout ce que j'ai.
Vous dites que vous avez un programme
pour me reloger ailleurs.
Mais vous n'avez pas de programme
pour ce qui se passe dans la rue ?
T'avais vu juste.
Je te l’avais dit.
Et je suis allé voir dans toutes les rues.
Pas de caméras, ni de surveillance.
Monk Man et son gang dealent ici
depuis des jours
et les stups le laissent faire.
Voilà ce qu'on va faire.
Mets quelques types à moi sur le coup.
Pas trop. Juste les plus jeunes.
Prends un minimum de came,
au cas où ce serait un piège.
- Tu me feras un rapport.
- Je m'en occupe.
C'est vraiment de la folie.
String a appelé, il sera en retard.
Il a un truc à finir.
- On n'est pas en force ?
- B, j'ai parlé à Black Donnie.
Crache le morceau, mec.
Arrête avec tes sous-entendus.
Black Donnie a refusé.
Il dit que frère Mouzone nous a cassés.
Et Peacock ?
Peacock a embauché des Dominicains.
Et Eggy Mule ?
Il est en taule. Cinq ans pour port d'arme.
Et Shorty Boyd ?
Shorty Boyd s'est racheté une conduite.
Ouais, je sais.
Il nous a foutus dans la merde.
Il nous reste qui ?
Cutty, le soldat que tu nous as envoyés,
il va le faire,
mais les autres, je sais pas.
Écoute, c'est ta place
qui est en train de se jouer, là.
Va dehors, chope Cutty et les meilleurs,
fais-en baver à Marlo. Je veux mes rues.
C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
ENTREPRISES B&B
APPARTEMENTS DE LUXE
- Quoi encore ?
- On a des problèmes.
C'est pas le moment, mec.
J'ai des trucs à régler.
Ça peut prendre des semaines
avant que les inspecteurs
viennent approuver les changements.
- Des semaines ?
- Et vous perdez de l’argent.
C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
Y en a qui arrivent à se faire de l’argent ?
À chaque fois que je crois que c'est réglé,
vous voulez une rallonge.
- Vous devez passer un coup de fil.
- Encore ?
C'est lui le spécialiste, non ?
Vous le payez grassement
pour qu'il vous conseille, non ?
C'est pour ça qu'on a un type
avec des relations qui bosse avec nous.
Il va en ville et fait
ce qu'on ne peut pas faire tout seuls.
La démocratie dans l’action, M. Bell.
Bon, voilà.
Moi et Slim, on va passer par les ruelles
et les prendre par surprise de côté.
Toi, tu passeras par ici.
- Ralentis en passant au carrefour.
- Attends.
Et si on passait par là ?
Comme ça,
il n'y a pas de carrefour à traverser.
Par là ? T'exposes directement
le conducteur aux tirs.
Réfléchis un peu. S'il se fait descendre,
la voiture va s'écraser quelque part.
Tu vois un peu ?
Et puis tu vas pas tirer
par-dessus l’épaule du conducteur, si ?
Bon, alors arrivez doucement.
Ils vous attendront pas
parce qu'ils seront concentrés sur nous.
Choisissez vos cibles, descendez-les
et barrez-vous rapidement.
- Qui conduit ?
- Moi.
Une fois au bout de la rue, ralentissez
et balancez vos armes.
Et virez toutes les boîtes de cartouches
qui restent dans la voiture.
La police remontera jusqu'à nous.
- On jette aussi les gants ?
- Non, vous les gardez.
Ils seront pleins de cette connerie d'A.D.N.
Bon, l’organisation va prendre
un peu de temps,
vous serez tous dans les parages,
à quatre ou cinq rues.
Quand c'est prêt,
on vous passe un coup de bigo.
Mais vous mouftez pas
tant que je vous ai pas appelés. Pigé ?
On va faire notre boulot.
Mais faites en sorte
qu'il nous reste du boulot,
je ne veux pas sentir
que je suis juste un pion.
C'est clair.
C'est juste un relogement,
rien de compliqué.
Je ne demande pas
de protection rapprochée
- ou quoi que ce soit.
- Rien de compliqué ? Allez, Bunny,
où je vais trouver une maison
pour cette vioque ?
J'en ai déjà une.
C'est une saisie sur Harford Road.
Tu remplis la demande en urgence
et mes gars l’aident à déménager.
Elle témoigne contre de dangereux dealers.
Sans son aide, je doute que ça avance.
Elle a 73 ans.
Il faut du courage pour faire ça, mais...
Allez, Ray.
On a perdu un témoin
sur une affaire de came.
On veut pas en perdre un autre
tout de suite.
Si Rawls l’apprend,
je dirai que t'as imité ma signature.
Elle habite où, en ce moment ?
Sur Vincent Street, dans le secteur deux.
- Ça craint vraiment ?
- Tu peux pas imaginer.
On devrait attendre son appel.
Et s'il y a des guetteurs ?
Si on attend,
ce sera terminé le temps qu'on arrive.
Et en plus, qu'est-ce qu'il va dire, Avon ?
C'est eux qui auront tout le mérite.
Allez, les gars, prenez vos armes.
C'est ce putain de Nay-Nay.
Si on le descendait ?
- On devrait attendre le coup de fil.
- Si on attend, il va se tirer.
Allez, on y va !
Dégagez !
Fils de pute !
C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
J'ai pas dit
qu'on devait attendre un coup de fil ?
Tu sais, toutes ces invitations
auxquelles tu ne réponds pas ?
Les inaugurations, les rénovations
de terrains de jeux ?
J'ai pas le choix.
J'ai failli faire la même chose.
Un gala organisé par les Delta Phi.
Mais je suis allé au Forum par solidarité.
Tu sais qui était là, en fauteuil ?
Ce bon vieil Odell Watkins.
Le grand faiseur de pluie.
Il disait publiquement
qu'il était déçu par le maire.
Déçu. C'est vrai ?
- C'est-à-dire ?
- Il était vraiment déçu.
Comme on est déçu par ses enfants.
Il voulait vraiment
qu'on mette la pression au maire.
Ça m'a fait cogiter.
Quelqu'un a peut-être ses chances
contre lui ?
Qui ? La présidente du conseil ?
Mickey Pepper se battrait bien.
Non, Mick a dit
qu'il ne voulait pas quitter la législature.
Il faut quelqu'un qui en veuille.
Et quelqu'un de noir.
Parce qu'on est à Baltimore.
- Vous en avez eus combien ?
- Deux.
Ils ont presque pas pu tirer.
Les types de Barksdale sont pas si géniaux.
Il va se venger.
Il s'arrêtera pas là.
Je veux pas que ça s'arrête.
Barksdale est faible, en ce moment.
Il a pas autant de gars
qui le suivent que moi.
C'est clair, c'est toi qui as l’avantage.
Une fois que tu seras le chef de file,
tu feras quoi ?
Quand on y est,
faut garder la même vitesse de croisière.
Ça devrait pas être trop difficile.
Ouais.
Les prisons et les cimetières
sont remplis d'anciens rois déchus.
Au moins, ils ont été les rois.
À mon tour de porter la couronne.
On réussira. Pas vrai, Chris ?
- On réussira.
- C'est comme si c'était fait.
Tu veux un t-shirt blanc ?
Il t'en faut un.
T-SHIRTS BLANCS PAS CHERS
Toujours sur ton projet, Bubs ?
Un dollar par ci, un dollar par là.
Quoi de neuf ? Pourquoi t'as appelé ?
Comme ça.
Ce type, Marlo, il vous intéresse toujours ?
Non ?
Si tu veux du fric, tu vas à Park Heights
Kintel ?
Mes chefs se foutent de Marlo.
Les gars de Stringer aussi.
- C'est dommage.
- Oui.
Parce que c'est très mouvementé.
Pourquoi ?
Marlo se laisse pas marcher sur les pieds.
Il a descendu deux mecs de Barksdale
à l’angle de Mount et Fayette.
- Il y a deux heures.
- Quoi ?
C'est tendu, dans la rue, en ce moment.
Marlo bossait pour Stringer.
On les a vus ensemble.
Je sais pas ce que t'as vu.
Mais Marlo, il fait cavalier seul.
L’ouest, ça va bientôt ressembler à Bagdad.
Mais vous vous intéressez à Jake Kintel ?
Vous savez jamais ce que vous voulez.
Un petit cadeau pour toi et tes hommes.
Appelle-moi.
T-shirts blancs, pas chers !
J'ai été informé de l’incident,
mes hommes s'en occupent.
On a tout de suite appelé l’équipe mobile
et les narcos quadrillent les lieux.
<i>Que sait-on jusqu’ici ?</i>
Apparemment c'est entre gangs rivaux.
Que dit la crim ?
<i>Peu importe la crim.</i>
<i>C’est à vous
que je demande des réponses, major.</i>
<i>- Mes hommes...
- Et vous n’en avez pas.</i>
Mes hommes sont sur les lieux...
Qu'est-ce qu'on peut lui dire ?
Vous l’avez dit. Des gangs rivaux.
Quels gangs ?
Des gangs.
Des connards qui ne s'apprécient pas.
Désolé, mais on n'a rien de plus.
Vas-y. Ça m'est égal.
Y a que les atouts qui comptent.
Bonsoir, Omar.
Bonsoir, Bruiser.
En parlant d'atouts...
Bonsoir, tout le monde.
Qu'est-ce qu'on mange ? Je meurs de faim.
C'est en train de cuire.
- Salut, papa.
- Comment ça va, ma belle ?
Papa, on a partagé avec toi.
C'est gentil.
Où est la cassette
que je regardais hier soir ?
Je ne l’ai pas vue.
Il faut que tu la voies.
C'est la cassette
de la dernière réunion du conseil.
Keiffer a voulu bloquer ma résolution,
je l’ai mouché.
J'étais dans une forme exceptionnelle.
- Tu as vu la cassette ?
- Elle est peut-être dans le magnétoscope.
Quoi ? Putain de merde !
- On peut savoir qui...
- Frank a partagé
son sandwich avec toi.
On l’avait caché pour que personne
le trouve avant que tu rentres.
Je peux avoir
des chips et des cornichons, avec ?
Je veux pas te manquer de respect.
String est sympa avec moi.
Je parle pas que de mes factures.
Lui et Avon doivent se sentir coupables.
C'est pas non plus
ce que les gens pensent ou disent.
Qu'est-ce qu'ils disent ?
D me manque.
Vraiment.
Moi aussi, il me manque.
- Ça fait longtemps qu'il nous a quittés.
- Plus d'un an.
Stringer est un type bien.
Je vais pas dire le contraire.
Je me sens en sécurité avec lui.
Tu veux savoir
si tu peux sortir avec String ?
Moi, ça me pose aucun problème.
Je croyais que tu le prendrais mal.
Toute cette histoire avec D,
c'est tellement dur.
Dès que j'y pense...
Tu sais, y a un flic
qui est venu ici pour me reparler de tout ça.
- C'était qui ?
- Un inspecteur de la ville.
Il a essayé de monter D contre Avon
quand il s'est fait arrêter dans le Jersey.
Un Blanc ?
- Cheveux épais ?
- Ouais.
Qu'est-ce qu'il a dit ?
Hein ?
Il a dit
que D'Angelo ne s'était peut-être pas...
Tu vois.
Suicidé.
Il a dit que c'était peut-être autre chose.
Il t'a dit ça comme ça ?
Il m'a laissé sa carte,
mais je lui ai rien dit.
J'en ai juste parlé à Stringer.
Elle va se présenter au conseil ?
Oui.
Elle va sans doute gagner,
telle que je la connais.
Et toi, tu es le mari tout fier ?
Je ne sais pas vraiment quoi en penser.
C'est uniquement jusqu'aux élections
l’année prochaine.
Ça fait bien d'avoir un lieutenant de police
au bras.
Tout le monde s'en fiche, non ?
La moitié du pays est divorcée.
L’autre moitié divorce
pour la deuxième fois.
C'est un service que je lui rends.
C'est difficile à expliquer.
Je l’ai déçue.
Elle a vécu à travers moi
pendant longtemps,
se disant qu'au pire,
je serais préfet de police adjoint,
et que la police était derrière moi.
Il y a aussi d'anciens événements,
quand j'étais affecté dans l’est.
Elle voulait que je lui donne davantage.
Elle voulait que je lui donne davantage.
Après pas mal d'années et de projets,
je suis plus doué pour le boulot de flic
que pour grimper des échelons.
Elle restait là, croyant que ma carrière
allait décoller de façon spectaculaire.
Je l’ai laissée vivre dans cette illusion
pour avoir la paix.
Et maintenant, c'est elle qui veut décoller.
Et toi, qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Je ne veux plus la décevoir.
Pour l’instant,
je l’aide plus
en m'affichant à des dîners mondains
avec mon alliance et mon uniforme,
qu'en étant un mari encombrant
qui couche avec une Blanche.
Cette fois-ci,
je ferai en sorte qu'elle ait ce qu'elle veut.
Rien de plus.
La dernière fois que j'ai vu Gérard,
il esquivait des balles sur Fayette.
Il s'en sortait pas trop mal.
Tant qu'il sera pas revenu,
on saura pas ce qui s'est passé là-bas.
Mais y a un truc que je sais.
Deux mecs à nous sont morts,
et on peut rien faire.
La police va nous faire chier.
Moi, je dis, on prend notre temps,
on se trouve des gros bras...
Non, j'ai pas le temps, putain !
Quand on saura que Marlo
gagne du terrain, j'aurai l’air de quoi ?
Je vais m'en occuper tout seul.
Tu viens juste de sortir de taule.
Si t'es impliqué dans un meurtre,
finie la liberté.
Je vais m'en occuper.
Avec Cutty, on se disait
qu'on pourrait s'en charger nous-mêmes.
Comme ça, y aura pas de bavures.
Mettez-vous sur le coup.
Et faites ça bien.
T'as vu comment ça se passe ?
Dans ce business, on plaisante pas.
Un point c'est tout.
Comme au bon vieux temps.
Je sais pas, mon pote. Tu sais...
Tu sais...
J'étais dehors avec un de nos jeunes gars,
sur Vincent Street, là où il y a
toutes les maisons abandonnées.
Y a des gangs
qui vendent de la came
comme si c'était des bonbons.
Des gosses à un stand de foire.
C'est pas le même monde.
Les flics bronchaient pas,
comme si tout ça,
c'était légal.
C'est comme ça
tous les jours.
Ils faisaient leur business là-bas.
Qu'est-ce que tu dis ? Y a un problème ?
Non, rien.
Laisse tomber.
Notre indic dit qu'ils bossent avec Stringer.
On s'occupe des cadavres,
comme vous le vouliez.
On pensait
que Marlo bossait pour Stringer,
mais c'est sans doute faux.
Il veut peut-être se battre
pour avoir ses rues.
Je vais être clair.
On ne s'intéresse plus à Stringer Bell,
Kintel Williamson ni quiconque.
Quel est mon grade, inspecteur Greggs ?
- Mon grade !
- Lieutenant.
Quel est mon grade, inspecteur McNulty ?
Si vous ne vous souvenez pas de ça,
vous pouvez retourner chez les stups.
Et vous, vous pouvez aller
là où on voudra bien de vous.
Maintenant, sortez de mon bureau.
Tu disais que tu serais là, sur ton message.
Mais je pensais que j'aurais affaire
à un de tes sous-fifres.
T'as rendu visite
à la famille d'un des miens.
Je ne fais que mon boulot.
Rien que de très normal.
Je sais que tu es très occupé.
J'ai entendu parler des mecs
que vous avez bousculé dans l’ouest.
C'était au sujet d'une arme de service.
Oui, j'en ai aussi entendu parler.
Mais là, ça n'a rien à voir.
Une certaine Tosha s'est fait descendre
dans une fusillade.
Si t'es pas là pour coopérer,
pourquoi t'es là ?
Je pourrais interroger l’autre nana
de ton gang.
Elle te dira rien.
Personne te dira rien.
Je suis venu pour que ce soit bien clair.
C'est pas grave.
J'ai déjà trouvé un témoin oculaire.
Vraiment ?
Ça m'étonnerait.
Le vieux Bruiser y voit plus très clair,
avec tout ce mauvais alcool.
Il va falloir le faire dessoûler
avant de le faire témoigner.
Et puis il a changé sa version de l’histoire.
Enfin, c'est ce qu'on m'a dit.
Sinon, vous allez devoir appeler ça
Sinon, vous allez devoir appeler ça
un dommage collatéral,
ça vous connaît dans la police.
Tu piges ?
C'était pas un contribuable.
Faites comme d'habitude, si on se flingue
entre nous, y a pas de victime.
Arrête un peu. Pas de victime ?
J'ai vu la famille de Tosha.
Tous ces morts, on les paie un jour.
Tu sais même pas de quoi je parle.
J'étais un peu plus âgé que toi,
à Edmonson.
Mais tu te souviens de notre quartier.
Il y avait de vrais mauvais garçons.
C'était pas tant les armes
que la démerde.
Ces types savaient se battre.
Mon père
m'a fait marcher dans le droit chemin.
Mais moi aussi, je voulais jouer au dur.
J'allais à toutes les fêtes
où il y avait les gros durs.
Ils savaient que j'étais pas comme eux.
Ces espèces de baraques me disaient:
"Rentre chez toi, minable.
T'as rien à faire ici."
À l’époque, je ne comprenais pas
qu'ils me rendaient service.
Même si c'était un quartier difficile,
on formait une communauté.
Il n'y avait pas de victime négligeable.
Maintenant, on n'a plus que des cadavres
et des espèces de prédateurs comme toi.
Là où la fille est tombée, j'ai vu des types
se comporter comme Omar.
Dire ton nom d'un air respectueux.
Ça me rend malade de voir
qu'on est tombés si bas.
25000 $ . Ça devrait suffire.
Quoi ?
C'est comme ça qu'ils fonctionnent,
pour les permis de construire.
Ils savent que t'as un entrepreneur
et que ses ouvriers attendent.
Tu paies le double
pour chaque semaine chômée.
Avec 25000 $, j'aurai les permis ?
20000 $ suffisent pour les permis.
Les 5000 $ restants,
c'est pour que je corrompe les officiels.
C'est moi qui prends le risque
d'aller voir ces voleurs
avec de l’argent à la main, non ?
Je vais te dire, String,
ceux qui dirigent la ville maintenant
feraient passer leur prédécesseurs
pour des saints.
C'est vraiment honteux.
J'aurai les permis quand ?
Lundi. Au plus tard.
Héro ! Capsules vertes.
Héro !
Cut, c'est lui.
Crétin.
Héro ! Capsules vertes.
- Je le connais, ce black.
- Vraiment ?
- Il me doit de l’argent.
- Vraiment ?
Héro. Capsules vertes.
- Pas comme ça.
- Héro. Capsules vertes.
Non, elle a dit ça comme si elle voulait
tomber enceinte. Attends.
Ça va ?
Merde !
J'ai tiré trop vite, ça a dévié ton tir.
Allez, on y va.
Y a des keufs juste là.
- Ouais, je sais. C'est rien.
- Quoi ?
Les keufs laissent les blacks dealer, ici.
C'est juste...
Cassez-vous, bande de branleurs.
Barre-toi, petit.
Mais d'où ils sortent ?
Et s'ils nous mettent au trou ?
J'espère que vous avez
vos brosses à dents.
Parce qu'en taule,
si t'as pas ta brosse à dents,
faut que t'utilises celle d'un autre,
ou que tu te frottes les dents avec le doigt.
Si vous vous faites pas arrêter,
vous pourrez garder 20 $ en plus
sur le matos.
Bien.
- Qui veut de la balle ?
- Destruction massive assurée !
Allez, Tommy, arrête.
Fais-le pour moi, Terri.
Dis-moi pourquoi tu veux devenir maire.
Pourquoi devrais-je voter pour toi ?
Cette ville ne tourne pas rond
et je crois que je peux être utile.
Ce type se fiche de régler les problèmes.
La criminalité est incontrôlable.
La semaine dernière,
un gosse qui devait témoigner
est mort à cause
des aberrations du système.
Le maire m'a promis d'agir.
Ensuite, monsieur "La réforme,
c'est plus qu'un slogan pour moi"
me donne une tape sur les fesses,
me remercie
et m'indique la porte. Terminé.
Avec pour cheval de bataille la criminalité,
le grand homme blanc arrive à la rescousse
Des gens de toutes les couleurs
sont en colère.
Tu penses que c'est faisable ?
Le maire a des problèmes avec sa base
électorale et ses supporters clés.
Ensuite, le préfet de police,
qui travaille pour Royce, m'a parlé
des dysfonctionnements de la police
et de la petite cour de Royce.
Enfin, Tony Gray, du cinquième district,
m'a soufflé qu'il comptait se présenter
aux élections municipales.
Ce qui diviserait les votes noirs.
Il te faudrait quelqu'un
qui donne à la bourgeoisie noire
la permission de voter
contre l’un des siens.
T'as quelqu'un à me proposer ?
Ce genre de profil se fait rare.
Elijah ?
C'est pas les congressistes noirs
qui vont sauver ta peau.
Et Odell Watkins ?
C'est drôle que tu m'en parles,
je crois qu'il est un peu déçu par le maire,
en ce moment.
Apparemment, la cote de popularité
du maire est en baisse.
Il faudrait que tu trouves pas mal d'argent.
Il faut qu'il comprenne.
On n'en est plus là.
Il a besoin qu'on le respecte.
Au diable le respect.
- Il a tort.
- Oui.
À ce stade-là, avec toi en face,
il préfère avoir tort.
S'il recevait un ordre de ses supérieurs,
il changerait peut-être d'avis.
Tu vois,
si ton pote Bunny ne sait plus
où donner de la tête avec ses cadavres,
il doit sûrement avoir besoin d'aide.
Même si t'es pas du genre
à poignarder quelqu'un dans le dos.
N'est-ce pas ?
Pas du tout.
Deux meurtres de plus hier.
Et trois autres aujourd'hui,
y compris une fillette de 14 ans.
On fait de notre mieux.
Ça fait 260 cette année,
et on est à peine en octobre.
Vous m'aviez promis 275 grand maximum.
C'était une promesse.
- Monsieur...
- Si on a dépassé les 300 d'ici le nouvel an,
je ne suis pas sûr
de pouvoir reconduire votre mandat.
Je suis désolé, mais c'est un fait.
Les types de Barksdale et qui d'autre ?
Marlo Stanfield. Le nouveau.
On le suit depuis quelques semaines.
Les gars de Daniels
bossent dans le nord-ouest, non ?
Votre guerre ne va faire qu'empirer.
Le nord-ouest est calme
depuis des semaines.
T'es prêt à cacher un truc pareil
à ton lieutenant ?
T'as pas changé, Jimmy.
Putain.
T'en fais toujours qu'à ta tête, hein ?
Voyez ce que vous pouvez faire.
Évitez de mentionner mon nom.
Comment ça s'est passé ?
On a eu un des deux fils de pute.
Vous venez ici pour vous vanter...
Tout ce que je dis, mon pote,
c'est qu'on n'a pas arrêté de les canarder.
Tu vois ?
Ça s'est un peu corsé,
mais on n'a pas arrêté.
- C'était...
- C'est bon. Du calme.
J'ai entendu. Asseyez-vous.
Je m'en fais pas pour ça.
Ça fait toujours un connard de moins
qui respire.
Vous pigez ? Donc, c'est tout bon.
Mais c'est toi qui me surprends.
Avant, tu te faisais jamais baiser.
C'est pas de sa faute.
J'ai vidé mon chargeur trop vite.
Ça lui a laissé le temps de se tirer.
- C'est moi qui ai merdé.
- Attends.
C'est de ma faute.
Il y avait un gosse
suffisamment près pour que je dégomme
la moitié de son crâne.
J'ai pas pu tirer.
J'ai pas réussi.
Pourquoi ?
Je le sentais pas.
Quand il y a quelque chose
qui guide nos actions,
il faut l’accepter.
Je ne suis plus comme ça.
D'accord.
Tu feras plus le soldat,
mais j'ai du boulot pour toi.
Je vais utiliser ta cervelle.
Tu pourrais surveiller une rue...
Non.
Tu m'as pas compris.
Je ne le sens plus. Tout ça.
Mais tu sais rien faire d'autre.
Alors qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Je sais pas.
Mais je peux plus faire ça.
D'accord. Ça marche.
- À plus.
- À plus.
Tu sais, c'était un sacré mec avant.
Ouais.
Il l’est toujours.
C'est un sacré mec.
Tu sais de quoi il s'agit ?
Lieutenant.
Qu'est-ce qui lui passe par la tête ?
Le voici, Bunny.
Cédric Daniels à la rescousse.
L’homme du moment.
- C'est tranquille ?
- On fait en sorte que ça le reste.
On fait la loi ici.
Les flics surveillent toutes les rues du coin.
- Sűrement un peu trop de cadavres.
- Oui, ça attire leur attention.
Mais tu sais, demain,
un autre gars se fera buter ailleurs
et ils dégageront d'ici.
Marlo a arręté de dealer.
Maintenant, il vend en gros.
Il y a personne qui vend de la drogue
pour lui ? Et ses avenues ?
Il a vite abandonné, non ?
Je commençais juste ŕ respecter
ce fils de pute pour son courage.
Écoute. Quand les flics se barrent,
vous allez tous occuper ces rues.
Ça marche, Bell.
- Des steaks de chez Bill.
- Non, j'en ai mangé mardi.
Et puis merde, choisis.
- J'y crois pas.
- Quoi ?
- Le gangster dans la voiture.
- Quoi ?
Je l’avais envoyé en taule.
- Ah bon ?
- Avon, comment déjŕ ?
Il dirigeait le trafic dans la cité.
C'était la cible de notre unité,
celle qu'on a montée
il y a quelques années, je t'en ai parlé.
- Ce fils de pute est déjŕ sorti.
- Il avait pris combien ?
Six, huit ans.
Qui s'en rappelle exactement ?
Et il est libre aprčs deux ans ?
J'ai dű me tromper dans les années.
C'est un trou du cul.
Il ne mérite que la taule.
- Du porc grillé du marché.
- Ça, c'est raisonner comme un flic.
INSPECTEUR
POLICE DE BALTIMORE
SUR ÉCOUTE
POLICE DE BALTIMORE
SERVICE STATISTIQUES
ÉTAT DU MARYLAND
MISE SUR ÉCOUTE AUTORISÉE
BALTIMORE CAPITALE DU CRIME
"C'est cher, une conscience."
- Butchie
Changement de plan.
C'est Bell, vous le reconnaissez.
La deuxičme cible est Marlo Stanfield,
il se bat contre Bell
pour les rues du quartier ouest.
- Et Kintel Williamson ?
- Cette affaire est en suspens pour l’instant.
En suspens ? On vient d'identifier
les portables de deux gars de son gang.
- Quoi qu'il en soit...
- On pourrait prendre
quelques semaines
pour bosser sur Kintel, non ?
On l’envoie devant le grand jury,
et on passe aux autres.
Ou on aura gaspillé deux mois.
Ce changement de cible a été voulu
par les deux préfets.
Le service est en mode réactif
pour réduire la criminalité
par tous les moyens.
Kintel a buté plein de gars il y a deux mois.
Aujourd'hui, c'est l’ouest
qui intéresse nos chefs.
Vous pensez tous que c'était rien pour moi
de rester assis sur ce toit
pendant des jours avec cette chaleur,
ŕ esquiver des essaims de bestioles,
mais merde, c'est n'importe quoi !
Toutes les recherches que j'ai faites sur
les actifs de Kintel, ses caisses, son argent,
je dois ranger ça dans un tiroir ?
Des fois, j'aimerais travailler
dans un vrai service de police.
Juste pour voir comment ils font,
vous voyez ?
McNulty. Dans mon bureau.
Tu peux trouver un truc pour moi ?
Quoi ?
Je dois savoir qui a loué cette chambre
au Hilton mardi, y a deux semaines.
Qui a loué la chambre ?
Adresse, carte de crédit,
tout ce que tu peux avoir.
- Ça a ŕ voir avec l’affaire ?
- C'est dur ŕ dire pour le moment.
Salut. J'ai fini de tondre.
Alors ?
Je vais utiliser ça pour couper
les mauvaises herbes au bord de la clôture.
- Ça marche ŕ l’essence.
- Je vais devoir l’amorcer.
Pas besoin de m'expliquer plusieurs fois.
Prends-toi de l’eau avant d'y retourner.
D'accord.
Tu as travaillé dur.
Si tu continues ŕ venir,
je continuerai ŕ t'engager.
Bien, je n'ai rien d'autre.
Tu es revenu dans le monde
du travail légal, pas vrai ?
- J'ai essayé.
- Je t'aurais cru perdu.
Les officiers de la liberté conditionnelle,
les agences de travail temporaire.
J'avais l’impression
d'interrompre leur pause-déjeuner.
Pas de famille ?
J'ai juste ma grand-mčre.
Elle me laisse dormir dans son sous-sol.
C'est déjŕ beaucoup lui demander.
Tu devrais parler ŕ quelqu'un d'autre
que ta grand-mčre.
Tu as pensé aux intervenants sociaux ?
Je me suis bien entendu avec un type.
Il était cool.
- Mais je n'étais pas pręt.
- Tu as l’air pręt maintenant.
Si tu trouvais un confident,
t'aurais pas besoin de me parler.
Je sais que tu vas en avoir marre
de ma sale gueule.
Bois pas trop vite,
tu vas avoir des crampes.
- C'est une question ?
- Oui.
Lieutenant, je n'ai pas...
Ça ne me dérange pas de changer de cibles
si ce sont les ordres des chefs.
Ŕ moins que ce soit personnel,
comme quand Kima a été blessée.
Pour moi, c'est du pareil au męme.
Bell, Williamson, peu importe.
C'est juste notre travail de flics.
Et je comprends que mes supérieurs
ont le droit de prendre des décisions.
- Et s'ils se trompent ?
- Ça arrive.
Et le temps le montrera, n'est-ce pas ?
Maintenant, je vous demande la vérité.
- Vous ętes allé voir Colvin dans mon dos.
- J'aurais pu parler au diable en personne.
Votre position n'avait rien ŕ voir lŕ-dedans.
Petit merdeux.
Je l’ai fait parce que ça devait ętre fait.
Comme ça devait ętre fait il y a deux ans
quand on a monté cette unité.
Ŕ l’époque, Stringer était la cible,
et il l’est toujours.
En tant que chef,
vous ętes meilleur que la majorité
et vous vous ętes battu
pour me faire revenir avec vous.
Ça, je le sais, mais maintenant,
on bosse de nouveau sur le bon type.
Inspecteur McNulty.
Quand Stringer sera arręté, vous devrez
vous trouver un nouveau travail.
Cette unité se passera de vos services.
Tu as bien compté ?
Oui, je suis allé ŕ Richmond
pour avoir ce lot.
Oui, j'attends.
- Tu as fait comme on a dit, hein ?
- Oui.
Donne-lui ça.
On aura besoin de 60 de plus
dans quelques jours.
- 60 de plus ?
- Tu sais comment on fait.
Alors, ne chiale pas, Bernard.
- Vous avez dű oublier quelque chose.
- Non.
J'ai les rapports de tous les secteurs.
Les vols et les cambriolages sont stables.
Les fusillades et les agressions ont baissé.
Les arrestations liées ŕ la drogue aussi,
mais le trafic continue.
Dans le district,
ŕ quel endroit y a-t-il une baisse ?
Presque tous les postes prčs des
zones de drogues sont en hausse.
Ce n'est pas bien, mais partout ailleurs,
c'est en baisse.
- Les chefs vont t' adorer.
- Il est trop tôt pour se vanter.
Ça peut ętre, comment vous appelez ça ?
Une aberration statistique.
Tu ne vas pas leur dire
que ton expérience semble fonctionner ?
Non, pas encore.
Je vais vous dire ce que l’on va faire.
Ŕ partir de la semaine prochaine,
on va mettre une patrouille
dans les coins tranquilles
de tous les secteurs 24 heures sur 24.
On va prendre ces neuf gars,
doubler les effectifs
dans les coins oů ça chauffe.
Avec moins de coins ŕ surveiller,
on va pouvoir améliorer
nos résultats, non ?
- Je peux avoir deux portables jetables ?
- Ils sont en promotion.
- Quatre pour 180 $ .
- J'en veux juste deux.
La derničre séance
ŕ Westview est ŕ 20 h 45.
On pourrait y aller si on fait pas
ce putain de voyage aujourd'hui.
Il me semble
que tous les téléphones se valent.
Y a que les imbéciles
pour aller aussi loin pour rien.
Si tu continues,
je vais te laisser ŕ Baltimore.
Je ne fais pas confiance ŕ un mec tout seul
sur la route. Je ne suis pas stupide.
Bordel. M. Le préfet !
Comment ça se passe ?
Ça se passait beaucoup mieux
avant la réunion du cabinet du maire.
Il vous a engueulé ?
Il a dit qu'on doit finir en dessous de 300
cette année, coűte que coűte.
- J'ai essayé de lui dire...
- Erv, j'ai une question.
Quel est votre avis sur le truc
de protection des témoins ?
Comment ?
Le remaniement du programme
de protection des témoins.
Personne de la mairie ne vous a appelé
pour parler de ce problčme
de meurtre des témoins ?
Il y a une semaine,
j'ai reçu un appel du chef du personnel.
Il disait que je devais essayer
d'éviter que d'autres témoins soient tués.
Rien sur le remaniement du programme.
Ŕ moins d'y injecter plus d'argent,
on ne peut pas faire grand-chose.
Vous n'avez pas parlé de ça
directement au maire ?
Vous n'allez pas me baiser avec ça ?
Je suis déjŕ dans le collimateur du maire.
Votre nom ne sera pas mentionné.
Le maire ne m'a rien dit.
Merci.
<i>... n’est rien.
La radio numéro un de D.C., WPGC 95.5.</i>
OUEST - Burtonsville
On est oů maintenant, bordel ?
Achčtes-en 4 ou 5, Bernard. Si tu fais
comme ça, ça ira deux fois plus vite.
Je veux une glace et des beignets.
Tous ces appels
d'un seul portable jetable ?
Oui, et il est mort.
Il a été utilisé par des membres du gang
de Marlo et l’indic de Kima l’a ramassé.
On ne peut rien en tirer.
Il faut approfondir nos infos
sur les opérations avec de la surveillance
et des infos de l’indic.
Par contre,
si on avait un jetable utilisé
par un des hommes de Stringer,
on pourrait utiliser nos infos
sur cette organisation
pour faire toutes sortes de liens.
Mettez la main sur un jetable,
on vous donnera le réseau.
- C'est la bonne nouvelle.
- C'est quoi la mauvaise ?
Lls ne seront plus en service. On peut
vous donner le réseau sans problčme
mais alors, ça fera une semaine
et ils les auront déjŕ jetés.
Je ne sais pas encore
comment mettre ces trucs sur écoute.
Eh bien, fais en sorte d'y arriver, mon pote.
BaBa Jani
ÉPICERIE
Si tu continues ce boulot,
je vais vraiment grossir.
- Juste deux ?
- Juste deux.
Tu connais pas l’achat en gros ?
Tu pourrais économiser plein de fric.
En attendant, c'est moi qui te coűte cher.
- Pourquoi t'as un flingue, Bernard ?
- Tu sais pas ?
- Avon est de retour, alors on s'équipe.
- T'es pas le seul en liberté conditionnelle.
- Tu me tapes sur les nerfs.
- C'est pas le seul truc que je me tape.
On rentre.
Gros sachet blanc, j'ai un gros sachet.
- C'est qui, déjŕ ?
- Broadus, alias Bodie.
Avant, il était dans les pavillons.
Puis, il a eu une tour.
Gros sachet blanc,
j'ai un gros sachet blanc.
Il lui reste combien de minutes
sur son téléphone ?
- On y va, bordel.
- Lester a besoin d'un téléphone.
Il y a une méthode plus facile.
Je te montrerai demain.
Venez.
C'est pour moi.
Gros sachet blanc ici.
Elle veut juste
que je sois heureuse, tu sais ?
Et je ferai la męme chose pour elle
quand je pourrai.
Comme cette histoire avec l’inspecteur.
Brianna veut
que j'aille avec elle voir les flics
pour écouter ce que l’inspecteur a
ŕ dire sur D'Angelo.
Et je sais que ce n'est pas vrai,
mais elle est vraiment furieuse.
Et j'ai essayé de lui dire ce que tu m'as dit.
Mais elle veut aller le voir
et lui parler elle-męme, je crois.
- Tu lui as parlé du flic ?
- Quoi ?
De l’inspecteur.
Tu lui as dit ce que tu m'as dit ?
C'est son fils, non ?
Elle a le droit de savoir
ce qui se passe, non ?
- Écoute, j'ai juste pensé...
- Quoi ?
Pourquoi tu la fais chier
avec ces conneries, bordel ?
C'était il y a un an,
tout le monde a oublié cette merde,
et toi, tu vas raconter des conneries ?
- Mais...
- Elle va croire ces conneries aussi.
Quelle mčre ne va pas croire
que son fils ne s'est pas suicidé ?
- String...
- Elle va y croire
et ça va la rendre folle.
- Je voulais juste...
- Juste quoi ?
Désolée !
- Quand est-ce que tu lui as dit ?
- La semaine derničre, je crois.
Quand est-ce qu'elle va voir le flic ?
Elle va d'abord parler ŕ un avocat,
lui demander conseil.
- Ŕ qui, ŕ Levy ?
- Je crois.
- L’avocat.
- Levy ?
- J'imagine.
- Tu ne lui as pas demandé ?
Et cet enfoiré de Royce laisse faire ça.
Je vais aller lui en parler.
Pas pour gagner des points,
mais il me prend pour un con.
"C'est bien que vous nous ayez parlé.
"Je vais sensibiliser les gens
ŕ ce problčme. On va avancer."
Je n'aurais jamais cru
qu'il aurait l’audace de ne rien faire.
- Et tu as fait ce qu'il fallait faire.
- Oui, putain.
Quoi ?
Tu es allé lŕ-bas dans l’espoir
que Royce te décevrait.
Tu veux savoir que tu es meilleur,
que tu mérites son poste.
Si je me couche sur ce divan,
tu factures ŕ l’heure ?
Merci.
Il faut ętre suffisant
pour se présenter ŕ des élections.
Moi ? Je suis suffisant ?
Alors, qu'est-ce que tu vas faire ?
Appeler un journaliste ou deux,
dire du mal du maire,
faire une déclaration publique.
Dire du mal de lui ?
Avec les primaires en septembre prochain ?
Tommy, personne ne se souviendra
de la mort d'un témoin dans un an.
Ce serait mieux d'aller voir Royce,
de l’affronter, pas méchamment,
de lui donner une chance de s'expliquer
ou de prendre des mesures.
S'il fait quelque chose,
le problčme est réglé
et tu peux te flatter d'y avoir participé.
S'il ne fait rien, tu attends.
Tu peux peut-ętre rendre compte
de votre entretien dans une lettre
exprimant tes inquiétudes et tes regrets.
Tu seras bien placé
ŕ la mort d'un autre témoin.
Tout le monde est gagnant.
- Ŕ moins que tu sois le témoin.
- Je sais, tu as raison.
Mais il s'attaque ŕ un maire
qui a eu deux mandats. Ça va ętre trčs dur.
D'accord.
Oui, c'est cool.
- Il m'en faut 30 de plus lundi, ça marche ?
- Oui.
Oui.
J'ai oublié ça.
Tu comprends tout de travers, enfoiré.
Espčce de con.
J'ai des t-shirts, d'un blanc éclatant !
- Un pour 3 $, deux pour 5 $ .
- Capsules bleues, j'ai des bleues !
T-shirts ŕ vendre. Beaux et blancs,
un pour 3 $, deux pour 5 $ .
- J'ai ça, mec, 5 $ . Ils sont neufs.
- Non merci, mec.
- C'est juste 5 $ .
- Non, merci.
Va te faire foutre, mec, va te faire foutre.
J'ai des...
J'ai des t-shirts ŕ vendre.
Capsules rouges, capsules rouges,
capsules rouges ŕ vendre !
Du crack, j'ai du crack ŕ vendre !
Hé, le vendeur, qu'est-ce que tu as ?
De longs t-shirts blancs pour les jeunes.
T'as pas des bougies ?
Je veux acheter des bougies
et du papier toilette aussi.
- Tu seras lŕ demain ?
- Je ne peux pas partir.
- Si je pars, on va me piquer mon squat.
- Je reviens demain.
Yo, Johnny.
Quoi de neuf, Bubs ?
Merde, Johnny.
Je viens de fumer de l’héro.
Putain, j'ai mal aux bras
ŕ force de me gratter.
Mais ça va aller.
Viens, mec, tu dois faire une pause.
Je déconne pas, tu dois arręter. Viens.
Non, mec, regarde autour de toi.
C'est le paradis des dealers.
Je suis un seigneur, Bubs.
T'es un seigneur ?
Merde, pas encore.
- Vous venez ?
- Le major a dit de les emmener ici.
Il a pas dit de jouer les infirmičres
pour ces putains d'animaux.
Reculez. Reculez.
- On les menotte, sergent ?
- Non, laisse-les partir.
Putain, on vous a dit
de ne pas vous battre ici !
La seule rčgle, c'est pas de bagarres,
pas de coups de feu !
Vous foutez tout en l’air.
La prochaine fois que je viens,
me fais pas faire un 10-38.
Tu sais pas ce que c'est ?
C'est l’ambulance, pauvre con.
Dispersez-vous, dispersez-vous.
- J'ai réveillé le bébé ?
- Tu le saurais si tu l’avais réveillé.
3 heures du matin. C'est gentil de rentrer.
- Je suis sortie pour décompresser.
- Oui, tu as l’air détendue.
Eh bien.
Je savais que tu assurais ŕ la maison.
C'est quoi, ton problčme ?
Pourquoi tu arrives ŕ parler
ŕ tout le monde sauf ŕ moi ?
Tu veux vraiment le savoir ?
Je t'écoute.
Notre relation me manque.
Ne blâme pas le bébé. Ne fais pas ça.
- Je ne blâme personne.
- Je ne l’ai pas fait toute seule.
- On a parlé de tout ça.
- Oui, on en a parlé.
Mais...
Je n'ai pas eu autant
mon mot ŕ dire que toi.
- Et pourquoi ?
- Parce que tu...
Tu le voulais plus que moi.
Je ne voulais pas te décevoir.
Je ne pense pas que j'aurais pu
ętre plus déçue que maintenant.
Va-t'en.
Vous en avez eu combien ?
Une nuit tranquille ?
L’équipe de minuit a dű virer un gang
qui voulait faire la loi.
Ŕ part ça...
Il y a trop d'enfants, bordel.
Depuis que dealer est légal,
plus besoin de guetteurs.
Ils se retrouvent livrés ŕ eux-męmes.
C'est comme un documentaire animalier.
Quand on déconne avec la nature,
certaines espčces
se font virer de leur habitat.
Tu viens d'utiliser le mot "habitat’ ?
Oui.
- T'as viré tes guetteurs ?
- Oui, et mes coursiers.
Merde, ŕ quoi ça sert ?
Tu te fais un max de fric,
tu es trop avare pour t'occuper
de ta main-d'śuvre.
- J'ai pas besoin d'eux.
- Mais ils ont besoin de toi.
T'étais bien content
de les avoir sous la main
et qu'ils dealent pour toi
alors qu'ils auraient dű ętre ŕ l’école.
- Bon, nouvelle initiative fiscale, mon pote.
- Quoi ?
Si vous voulez continuer ŕ dealer ici,
toi et tes potes,
vous devrez tous donner 100 $ par semaine.
- On veut toucher une commission ?
- Pas moi, c'est pas pour moi.
Ramasse le fric, je reviendrai.
Capsules vertes ! Quoi de neuf ?
Des vertes !
J'ai des capsules vertes.
Mais je ne vais pas aller
en prison pour ça ?
Je veux dire, c'est pas si grave, non ?
- Celui-lŕ ?
- Non, c'était un noir, pas un argenté.
Celui-lŕ, je crois.
Putain, je vois
que vous me réservez un plan galčre.
Ça me paraît clair.
Tu es juste tombé sur un flic malin,
c'est tout.
Il va essayer de te faire honte
avec la fille morte
ou avec des enfants qui admirent Omar
et son canon scié.
C'est tout ce qu'il peut faire,
surtout depuis que tu as descendu
le témoin qu'il avait.
Il joue sur ta culpabilité, mon garçon.
Ce gros tas m'a mis des trucs
en tęte que je peux pas oublier.
Tout le monde fait ce qu'il a ŕ faire
sans se soucier des autres.
Moi, toi, la police.
Tout le monde sur terre
a son propre terrain.
Un homme dans les affaires comme toi qui
commence ŕ se préoccuper de son image,
qui se soucie des autres
au lieu de lui-męme, il va mourir.
J'ai toujours l’impression
que je dois quelque chose, Butch.
J'avais un oncle en Caroline, il est mort,
mais je me souviens
qu'il souffrait beaucoup,
vraiment beaucoup,
d'avoir chassé sa compagne.
Alors, il s'est puni.
Il a coupé son petit doigt,
puis son annulaire.
Avec tout le sang sur la table,
il s'en est tiré de justesse.
Et le restant de sa vie,
je me souviens qu'il disait: "La salope,
elle valait moins qu'un petit doigt."
Mais c'était déjŕ trop tard.
Tu peux essayer ça, si tu veux.
Je ne sais pas, Butch. Je ferais
quelque chose de moins dramatique.
Tu me comprends ?
Tu lui as dit d'aller voir les flics ?
D'Angelo est son fils,
comment l’en empęcher ?
Écoute, il n'y aura pas de problčmes
si elle se tait et qu'elle écoute.
Non, c'est foireux.
Il ne faut pas que Brianna déconne
avec cette histoire.
- Je fais quoi ?
- Je sais pas.
Porter plainte contre l’inspecteur.
Je sais pas.
Pour harcčlement ?
Écoute, c'est le męme enculé
qui a fait tomber Avon.
C'est le męme qui vient me voir
pour me raconter n'importe quoi,
et maintenant, il va voir Brianna
avec ces conneries ?
Ça ne sert ŕ rien de porter plainte. En fait,
si les flics disent
que son fils ne s'est pas suicidé,
Brianna va le croire, de toute façon.

Je crois qu'Avon devrait ętre mis
au courant.
Oui, eh bien, je m'en occupe.
- Pas trop de deals par ici.
- Le gang rival a investi le quartier.
Oui. D'accord. Bien.
Ça va le faire aussi. D'accord.
Shamrock a dit qu'on doit aller
ŕ Hamsterdam et vendre lŕ-bas.
Au moins, jusqu'ŕ ce que les stups
dégagent d'ici.
- Venez.
- Oui. Oui. Venez.
- Un contrôle routier ?
- Pourquoi pas ?
- Hé, fils de pute.
- J'ai ce qu'il te faut !
J'ai des capsules roses.
Pas encore, espčce de petit con !
Vous pouvez pas faire ça.
On allait ŕ Hamsterdam.
Si tu continues,
tu vas te retrouver ŕ l’hosto.
Tu m'entends ?
On a l’immunité.
On va ŕ la zone de non-droit.
Quelle zone de non-droit, putain ?
De la marchandise.
Évidemment.
Pourquoi vous croyez qu'on allait lŕ-bas ?
- Baisse-toi. Vous alliez oů ?
- Hamsterdam.
Va te faire foutre !
- Vous voulez tous ętre arrętés ?
- Allez vous faire foutre !
Tu vas te taire et arręter ces conneries ?
Comme vous avez dit.
Voilŕ ton reçu. 244 $ pour moi,
arrondis ŕ 250 $ pour payer l’essence.
Ça me rembourse.
Et le reste ? Sers-t'en pour payer
les petits dealers pour la semaine.
Que tu les utilises ou non,
tu dois leur donner ce fric.
C'est comme une allocation-chômage.
Tous les employeurs doivent la payer.
Si vous ne les payez pas,
vous virez d'ici et on se remet
ŕ vous pourrir la vie dans la rue.
La moindre des choses,
c'est d'aider un peu les tiens.
T'es un putain de communiste ou quoi ?
<i>23-04. Besoin de renforts sur Fayette Street,
ŕ l’ouest de Vincent.</i>
<i>- C'est juste ŕ côté.
- Bien reçu. On y va.</i>
- Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
- Contrôle routier.
J'ai trouvé du matos sous le sičge.
On allait ŕ Hamsterdam.
On nous a dit qu'on n'aurait pas
de problčmes sur le chemin.
- C'est quoi Hamsterdam, bordel ?
- Flics de mes deux !
Ça va pas ętre possible.
- Carv, ils ont de la came.
- En route vers la zone de non-droit.
- Tu connais les rčgles.
- Oui,
- j'essayais de leur dire...
- Ferme ta gueule, merde.
<i>... ŕ toutes les unités sur Fayette et Vincent.</i>
<i>- Oui, chef ?
- Vous avez un problčme ?</i>
- Vous vous payez vraiment notre tęte.
- Tu l’as dit.
- Mais fermez-la !
- Putain, vous nous l’aviez promis !
Pour de vrai.
Vous vous foutez vraiment de nous.
Vous ętes tous des menteurs.
Carv, dis-moi ce qui se passe ici, putain.
Le major a dit qu'il arrivait.
Carv ?
Et merde.
- Tu es sűr que c'est ce flingue-lŕ ?
- D'aprčs Reesie, oui.
Qui suis-je pour le contredire ?
Dis-lui que je ne paierai pas sans preuves.
Je lui ai déjŕ dit.
Il veut 1500 $ de dédommagement.
Putain.
C'est cher, une conscience.
Je t'ai vu, Bernard. T'as pas passé la porte
que t'as déjŕ jeté la note.
- Arręte un peu.
- T'es le seul ŕ prendre ça au sérieux,
et si t'étais pas le mec le plus con
avec lequel je suis sortie,
tu aurais acheté ces trucs
en une seule fois.
Il ne m'en faut plus que six.
On aura fini dans une demi-heure.
Et si on faisait un autre arręt,
tu en achčterais six
et je te sucerais
pendant les 20 prochaines minutes.
Je t'ai eu.
Oh, putain.
Allez tous vous faire foutre.
- Je viens de faire 16 h d'affilée.
- C'est ça.
- Bunk, ligne trois.
- D'accord.
Accroche-la au panneau, Mike,
tu connais la rčgle.
<i>- Inspecteur Moreland.
- Il paraît que vous cherchez un truc.</i>
Je veux des portables jetables activés.
J'en veux huit.
Celui-lŕ est pour le secteur 2.
Dans le secteur 1,
j'utilise le pavillon vide sur Winchester.
- Dans le secteur 3, les entrepôts.
- C'est légal de dealer ici ?
- Dans le secteur 3, les entrepôts.
- C'est légal de dealer ici ?
Ce n'est pas légal.
- On essaie autre chose, c'est tout.
- Comment vous avez pu ?
Je sais que ça ne vous semble pas bien,
mais avant de devenir dingues
ŕ cause de ça,
allez voir dans mes pires rues
oů la drogue se vend.
Edmondson et Brice. North et Pulaski.
Hollins et Payson.
Toutes ces rues sont vides.
- Mais est-ce que les chefs le savent ?
- Non, ils n'en savent rien.
Écoutez, c'est juste une initiative
de ma part.
Mon Dieu !
Je savais bien
que quelqu'un du central
finirait par l’apprendre.
Il est normal que vous vouliez le signaler.
- Je vous demande...
- Vous avez légalisé la drogue !
Écoutez, il s'agit
d'un déploiement tactique.
On attend que tout soit réglé
dans les trois zones
et on passe ŕ l’action.
Écoutez, on coince tout le monde en grand
et on arręte ce mančge.
Désolé d'avoir fait foirer cette arrestation.
Je suis navré que vous m'ayez vu
lui rendre le matos.
C'était moche, je sais.
Mais j'essaie de sauver coűte que coűte
ce qu'il reste de mon district, si je peux.
Et plus j'ai de temps avant de raconter
ce déploiement aux chefs...
On a eu ce qu'il nous fallait.
Vous en faites pas.
Laissez-moi parler
ŕ mon ancien commandant.
Je ne sais pas, major.
Quand vous allez en finir avec ici,
ils vont revenir dans vos rues.
Les grands spectacles,
ce n'est pas votre fort.
Si ça ne marche pas, Jimmy,
tout redeviendra comme avant.
Je suis presque ŕ la retraite de toute façon.
Jimmy, j'ai besoin de plus de temps.
Je compte sur toi et tes coéquipiers
pour garder ça secret.
Les chefs ne sont pas au courant, hein ?
J'emmerde les chefs.
C'est vous qui avez appelé ?
Oui.
Vous avez été témoin des faits ?
J'ai bien peur d'ętre aveugle.
Au sens littéral.
Mais j'ai quelque chose ŕ vous montrer.
Je crois que c'est un Glock.40.
J'imagine que vous n'allez pas me dire
qui l’a apporté ici ?
Comme je vous ai dit, je suis aveugle.
Mais je pensais que vous le sauriez.
Dites-lui de ma part
que j'espčre qu'il pourrait avoir besoin
de ça au tribunal.
Ça se peut que les stups reviennent.
Oui, mais d'ici lŕ, tu t'occupes de cette rue.
- Et le gang de Marlo ?
- Écoute, Avon est sorti,
et tu es sur le territoire de Barksdale.
Tu me suis ?
- Avon n'est pas lŕ pour l’instant.
- T'es pas tout seul.
T'en fais pas pour ça, petit.
Salut.
Le portable du jeune Bodie Broadus.
Il reste des minutes.
Composition rapide ?
Caroline.
T'aurais pas une chambre libre
chez toi, par hasard ?
Juste pour une nuit ou deux,
le temps que je m'organise.
- Tu vas réparer les pots cassés ?
- C'est fini, je crois.
Merci.
La carte de crédit est liée ŕ un compte
de société au nom de Theresa D'Agostino.
Oui, c'est elle.
Quel genre d'entreprise ?
Le comité de campagne
pour un congrčs démocrate.
Les relevés de carte sont envoyés
ŕ une adresse de société ŕ Washington.
J'ai appelé le standard
et elle est répertoriée lŕ-bas.
D'Agostino, ça a pas l’air
d'ętre un nom du quartier ouest.
C'est sűr.
La vérité, c'est que je ne sais pas
ce que je veux.
Je sais que je cherche quelque chose
mais je ne sais męme pas quoi.
- Vous avez trouvé du travail.
- Au noir, mais c'est déjŕ bien.
Vous n'ętes pas lŕ pour un emploi ou pour
le programme d'équivalence des diplômes.
Alors, vous voulez rentrer dans l’église ?
Je veux juste...
J'ai ce sentiment depuis longtemps,
c'est comme si j'étais en dehors de moi,
en train de me regarder faire des choses
que je ne veux pas faire.
Je me vois
comme si j'étais quelqu'un d'autre
mais je ne peux jamais arręter le spectacle.
Je suis fatigué.
Cutty, c'est ça ?
Non.
Dennis.
<i>- Elle est partie ?
- Oui.</i>
J'imagine, parce que je suis censé
la rencontrer, en fait.
Ce soir, oui.
Oui, exactement.
Je devais passer la prendre,
mais je suis en retard.
<i>- Elle a peut-ętre prévu autre chose.
- Oui, oui, je sais.</i>
C'est oů exactement ?
Je ne connais pas bien cette partie de...
<i>Ŕ l’angle de 15th Street et...</i>
D'accord.
Malheureusement, on a trop de conflits
en cours en ce moment.
Mais on a mis ça ŕ l’ordre du jour
de la prochaine réunion
du conseil de coordination
de la justice pénale.
Vous attribuez cette tâche ŕ un comité ?
Il s'agit juste de quelques centaines
de milliers de dollars.
Je ne vous dis pas qu'il faut créer
de nouvelles identités,
envoyer ces gens ailleurs comme le F.B.I.
Il faut les mettre ŕ l’abri.
J'ai quelque chose ŕ vous dire.
Je ne peux pas avoir tout cet argent,
si c'est pas utile.
- M. Le maire, je ne...
- Que voulez-vous que je fasse ?
Dois-je prendre l’argent déjŕ alloué
au budget de déneigement
du premier district ?
Et si je réduisais le ramassage des ordures
ŕ une fois par semaine
pour mettre les témoins
dans un grand hôtel du port ?
Je n'essaie pas de faire d'histoires.
Tommy, enfin.
La ville a des problčmes financiers et pas
de soutien du gouvernement de l’État.
On a fait tout ce qu'on pouvait
pour ce programme.
Bon, d'accord.
Eh bien, merci
pour votre temps. Messieurs.
Ah, quelle merde.
Je ne sais pas, chef,
s'il n'y avait pas autant d'enfants ici,
je pourrais accepter ça.
- Police de Baltimore.
- Baltimore ?
Baltimore, dans le Maryland.
- Je peux avoir un Jameson ?
- Du Bushmills, ça va ?
- C'est du whisky protestant.
- Mais le prix est correct, non ?
Sans eau, ni glaçons.
Excusez-moi.
- Salut.
- Salut.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
- Je me le demande.
Tu viens jusqu'ici
pour me regarder et tu t'en vas ?
- C'est un peu flippant.
- Tu avais l’air occupée.
Lui ? Chéri, on parlait juste affaires.
- C'est pas mon genre de milieu.
- C'est sűr.
J'ai fait une erreur, je ferais mieux d'y aller.
- 428 ?
- Tu habites dans cette ville.
- Pourquoi réserver une chambre ?
- J'habite loin.
Je ne veux pas conduire aprčs avoir bu.
- Tu me donnes deux heures, McNulty ?
- Qu'est-ce que je vais faire ?
Ręver de notre nuit.
L’eau est fraîche ?
Tu les gardes au frais ?
Il y a des petits pigeons dans les nids.
Les soins des petits. J'aime voir ça.
Oui, Marlo, il est trčs dévoué.
- Je ne peux pas le virer de ce nid.
- C'est du bon travail.
- C'est vraiment du bon travail.
- Les flics ne viennent plus ici.
J'ai vu.
Pendant un moment,
je vais continuer ŕ vendre en gros.
Tu sais, prendre du recul un peu.
Barksdale va penser qu'on est des lavettes
parce qu'on réclame pas ce qui est ŕ nous.
Si la police lâche ces rues,
il va les reprendre.
C'est clair.
- C'est ŕ ton tour.
- Il était temps. Pour de vrai.
Pour commencer,
la mémoire contient les dix derniers appels
reçus et passés par l’utilisateur.
- Ça suffit pour nous donner une signature.
- Comment ?
Le numéro de téléphone
unique d'une personne.
Comme ça, on peut identifier l’utilisateur
quand il change de téléphone.
Désolé, je me suis réveillé
dans une autre ville.
On a analysé ces numéros
et on en a tiré un schéma assez intéressant.
Voici le schéma
d'un réseau de communication fermé.
Prévisible de la part
d'un gang de vente de drogues.
Ce réseau comprend
- 15 portables jetables distincts.
- 15.
Et aucun ne donne d'informations
sur l’abonné.
- Et avec ça ?
- Avec les jetables
de cette entreprise,
pas besoin d'informations sur les abonnés.
Ont été passés dans ce réseau, avec
une durée moyenne de moins d'une minute.
Lŕ encore, typique du trafic de drogues.
Cet utilisateur-lŕ agit
en tant que bureau central.
Il reçoit des appels et met les gens
en relation. Il coordonne les affaires.
- Ce serait bien que ce soit Stringer.
- Voilŕ le meilleur.
C'est quelque chose que Prez a découvert
en jouant avec.
Il y a une fonction de composition rapide.
Ça veut dire que quelqu'un a pris le temps
de programmer le téléphone.
C'est le seul moyen pour ces jeunes
de se souvenir de tous les numéros.
Avec ces téléphones
qu'ils jettent réguličrement.
Tous les téléphones du réseau
doivent ętre programmés comme ça.
Bon. On devrait commencer
ŕ travailler sur les écoutes.
- Comment on fait ?
- Quoi ?
Lls jettent des portables tous les 15 jours.
Le temps qu'on mette ça sur écoute,
ils sont foutus.
Tout le réseau se ferme simultanément.
- Est-ce qu'on a un plan ?
- Non, pas encore.
Pour l’instant,
si on pouvait avoir d'autres portables,
ça pourrait confirmer notre théorie
pour l’affidavit.
Kima, tu peux demander
aux flics de l’ouest de ramasser
- des portables, non ?
- Oui, bien sűr.
Mon Dieu, tu sens le sexe.
- T'as pas pris une putain de douche ?
- J'étais en retard.
- T'as oublié mes clopes, non ?
- Oh, merde, oui, j'ai oublié.
Je mange ces chips et aprčs,
je vais t'en chercher.
<i>Unité 3-1, on a une fusillade.</i>
<i>- On a besoin de l’unité 2-1 ici.
- J’arrive.</i>
<i>- Bien reçu, 700.
- Déjŕ de retour ?</i>
Je pensais que vous en aviez assez
de notre joyeux district.
Rendez-nous service.
Lester veut que vous ramassiez
les portables jetés
sur le territoire de Barksdale.
Vous voulez les plaques
de Barksdale, et tout ?
Tout ce que vous avez.
J'ai vu un type dans un van l’autre jour.
J'ai pas vu les plaques,
mais si je le revois...
- Stringer ?
- Non, l’autre mec.
- Quel autre mec ?
- Celui qu'on a envoyé en taule.
- Avon.
- Avon Barksdale ?
Il est en prison
pour quatre ou cinq ans au moins.
- On se ressemble tous ?
- Va te faire foutre si tu me crois pas.
C'est impossible.
Le fait est que nous n'aurions pu
remettre la main sur cette arme,
remise ŕ cet officier, sans l’aide conjointe
des citoyens de Baltimore.
Je crois que M. Le maire
voudrait dire quelques mots.
Merci, M. Le préfet de police.
Je veux profiter de cette occasion
pour féliciter nos policiers
d'avoir résolu cette affaire
et pour souhaiter ŕ l’agent Dozerman
un prompt retour en service.
<i>Agent Dozerman, les citoyens souhaitent
que vous repreniez votre arme</i>
<i>et ils veulent vous remercier
pour vos bons et loyaux services.</i>
<i>Et je tiens particuličrement ŕ remercier
tous les habitants concernés</i>
<i>qui ont appelé la police.
Nous ne serions pas lŕ aujourd’hui...</i>
- Lester.
- Lieutenant, venez voir ça.
LIBÉRÉ LE 24 SEPT. 2004
C'est une blague.

monteuse, collčgue et amie. 1953-2004.
Ŕ la mémoire de Geraldine Peroni,

Des capsules rouges.
Deux pour le prix d'une.
J'ai de la Rasheed et Beno.
Rasheed et Beno.
Mets-lui de la glace sur les couilles.
Ça marche à tous les coups
pour réanimer un mec.
Où est-ce qu'on va trouver de la glace ici ?
- On va l’emmener à l’hosto.
- Rasheed et Beno. Rasheed et Beno...
- On peut avoir trois grammes ?
- Trois grammes, hein ?
Comment ça va aujourd'hui ?
Le prends pas mal,
mais on peut avoir notre came ?
D'accord. Je voulais juste être sympa.
J'en ai ici, yo !
Merci.
T'as appris que le bijoutier Mack Man
s'est fait braquer hier soir ?
Tout est dans la baraque, là-bas.
Si tu veux des jolis cailloux, vas-y
et dis à mon pote Rafik que je t'envoie.
Briquets, pipes, allumettes. Pipes, briquets.
J'ai tout ce qu'il vous faut.
Voyez mes pipes !
Des rouges, deux pour le prix d'une.
À ton avis, il est chargé, enfoiré ?
Des rouges, deux pour le prix d'une.
- Comment ça s'annonce ?
- De la bonne dope.
Trois overdoses.
Le dernier était mal en point
avant d'aller à l’hosto.
Merde.
Hé, je suis flic.
Il y en a plus à l’intérieur, Carv.
Putain !
Les flics sont jamais là
quand on a besoin d'eux.
INSPECTEUR
POLICE DE BALTIMORE
SUR ÉCOUTE
POLICE DE BALTIMORE
SERVICE STATISTIQUES
ÉTAT DU MARYLAND
MISE SUR ÉCOUTE AUTORISÉE
BALTIMORE CAPITALE DU CRIME
"Rampe, marche, et enfin, cours."
- Clay Davis
Sur ce portable jetable ?
J'ai donné le numéro de série à Trac.
Trac Corporation l’a envoyé à Northland,
une centrale d'achat.
Northland l’a envoyé
à leur centre de distribution à Hagerstown.
Hagerstown l’a envoyé
au magasin Buddy's Mondo Mart,
au 1440 Propane Road,
Falls Church, en Virginie.
C'est là qu'il a été acheté.
Quoi ?
Et il était exposé à gauche
ou à droite de la caisse ?
Comment voulez-vous que je le sache ?
Bon.
Quant aux numéros enregistrés
dans le téléphone,
on a un numéro local.
On a celui de la maison
de la grand-mère de Bodie
sur West Baltimore Street
et six autres numéros
qui sont tous attribués
à des portables jetables de chez Trac.
Et ces téléphones ont tous été achetés
en dehors de la ville.
Un à Catonsville, un à Laurel,
un à Bethesda
et aussi dans ces magasins en Virginie,
à Springfield, à Dumfries et à Lakeside.
Tous ces endroits se trouvent le long
de l’autoroute 95 entre ici et Richmond.
Ils font 300 km toutes les deux semaines
par simple précaution.
C'est magnifique.
Quoi ?
Cette discipline.
Est-ce que vous pensiez
revoir un jour ces rues comme ça ?
C'est pas des petits dealers qu'on entend.
C'est le pépiement des oiseaux.
- Quoi ?
- Vous allez voir.
Vous disiez:
"Pas de flingues ou d'intimidation."
Vous deviez assurer la sécurité.
Vous aviez dit
que ça serait le paradis sur terre.
- Servir et protéger, enfoirés.
- C'est la loi du talion.
Je veux porter plainte.
- Répète un peu.
- Vous m'avez entendu.
Tu veux porter plainte
parce que tu vendais de la came
- et que quelqu'un t'a piqué ton blé ?
- Oui.
- Ici.
- À Fredericksburg ?
Lls font tout ce chemin
pour des portables ?
Un ici, un là. Pas d'achats en gros.
Ils jettent leurs portables
toutes les deux semaines
et ils se méfient encore
à propos des écoutes.
Être parano, ça ne signifie pas
qu'on ne peut pas se faire prendre, non ?
Ça serait bien de savoir
qui achète tous ces téléphones.
Je prends le volant.
Yo, yo, yo. T'es preneur ?
Lls ont raison en un sens.
On leur dit de ne pas venir armés ici
et on n'arrive pas à les protéger.
À cause de ces voleurs, ces dealers
se sentent comme des agneaux
dans un enclos.
S'ils voient encore un flingue,
la trêve des confiseurs sera terminée.
Vous faites quoi à ce sujet ?
J'ai envoyé quelques victimes au poste
avec Herc.
Ils vont faire un portrait-robot,
vous savez comment ça marche.
Je peux être honnête ? Il n'y a pas
que des loups autour de l’enclos.
On a 50 ou 60 gamins à l’intérieur
qui ont toujours connu un monde violent
et qui ne foutent rien de leur journée.
Anciens transporteurs de drogue,
anciens guetteurs.
Ça me préoccupe plus
que ces histoires de braquages.
Si vous voulez neutraliser une menace,
donnez-lui du boulot.
- À faire quoi ?
- Flics auxiliaires.
Pour surveiller les prédateurs.
Les dealers les paient à rien foutre
de toute façon.
- On ferait d'une pierre deux coups.
- Oui.
On leur donne des vélos,
des radios de la police.
- On pourrait faire ça.
- Je disais ça... Vous êtes sérieux ?
Qu'est-ce que vous avez fait ici ?
J'ai de la came.
Destruction massive assurée.
Comment ça va ?
On cherche un type qui est venu ici
il y a 10 ou 11 jours,
et il a acheté deux portables prépayés.
- Il y a 10 ou 11 jours ?
- Oui.
- Un Noir, selon toute probabilité.
- Ça m'aide pas vraiment.
On peut vérifier les vidéos
des caméras de surveillance ?
D'il y a 10 jours ?
À moins qu'il y ait un incident,
on réutilise les bandes chaque semaine.
- Chaque semaine ?
- C'est la politique de Mondo Mart.
Ça s'est bien passé.
<i>- Allô ?
- Briana Barksdale t’a appelé.</i>
<i>- Qui ?
- La mère de D’Angelo Barksdale.</i>
<i>- Tu as son numéro ?
- Tu as de quoi noter ?</i>
<i>410-718-9433. Tu l’as ?</i>
C'est bon.
<i>- Tu vas l’appeler ?
- Je sais pas.</i>
<i>- À toi de voir.
- Merci, Jay.</i>
Regarde ça.
Mondo Mart, Mondo Mart,
Mondo Mart, Mondo Mart. On est baisés.
Sauf là. BaBa Jani Food Mart,
à Dumfries, en Virginie.
On se tape 150 km en espérant que ce type
a de la mémoire ou une caméra ?
Tu veux vraiment rentrer plus tôt
et décevoir Lester Freamon ?
Qui t'a appelé ?
Devine qui a appelé la criminelle
pour l’affaire D'Angelo Barksdale ?
- Sa mère.
- Vraiment ?
Merde, j'avais complètement oublié
cette affaire.
Elle appelle et elle pose des questions.
Une perte de temps pour elle et pour moi.
Tout comme ces vérifications.
Il a l’air naturel.
Cet enculé de Marlo.
Ce fils de pute va en baver.
On dirait que rien n'a changé,
sauf que je perds du blé.
Où est ma lettre d'approbation
de la commission de conservation ?
- Mon accord prioritaire, ma permission ?
- Du calme, du calme.
Ça va bientôt arriver.
On a les inspecteurs de la plomberie
et de l’électricité prévus demain,
mardi, ce sont les pompiers,
et ça devrait marcher, String,
tu seras sur la bonne voie.
Et au fait, félicitations.
Tu es maintenant un sous-traitant
qui fournit en ampoules électriques
les écoles
de la ville de Baltimore.
Putain, mais j'y connais que dalle
en ampoules.
Tu sais remplir un en-tête de lettre ?
Détends-toi, des types blancs feront
tout le boulot pour toi.
Tu lui sers juste
à délivrer des autorisations.
Ça te fait 5000 $ en plus par mois
à te tourner les pouces.
Tu comprends comment ça marche ?
Je vais t'aider à avancer, String,
mais ça se fera pas en un jour.
Cette année,
on fait des affaires avec la ville,
L’année prochaine,
ça sera avec l’État du Maryland.
Et la troisième année ?
On touche le jackpot.
On passe à l’échelon national.
Ensuite, on traitera avec le mec
qui s'occupe de la pompe.
- Quelle pompe ?
- La pompe à fric du développement urbain.
Je vois pas pourquoi
on doit attendre trois ans pour ça.
- Je suis prêt.
- Non. Tu n'es pas prêt.
Excuse-moi de te dire ça,
mais tu as encore la mentalité de la rue.
Tu pleurniches pour chaque dollar
que tu dépenses,
pour les permis,
pour les comités d'actions politiques,
pour l’argent investi
dans la campagne de réélection,
c'est là-dessus que je fais mon beurre.
Écoute, il faut investir
pour gagner de l’argent,
sinon, n'importe quelle cloche serait roi.
Je suis prêt à me lancer maintenant.
Trois ans.
Rampe, marche, et enfin, cours.
- Non, les cheveux plus frisés.
- Oui, c'est ça.
Et les yeux... Il avait de tout petits yeux.
Ça veut dire quoi, des petits yeux ?
- Comme des yeux de rat.
- Yo, mets un grain de beauté ici.
- Il avait pas de grain de beauté.
- Si.
T'étais trop occupé à flipper
quand il te braquait
- pour voir ce fils de pute.
- Putain, un peu, que je l’ai vu.
- Tu sais t'en servir ?
- Mieux que toi, apparemment.
Essaie les oreilles décollées.
- Pourquoi ?
- Parce que je te le dis.
Oh, merde. Essaie avec des yeux clairs.
- Pourquoi ?
- Putain, parce que je te le dis.
Tu peux le faire loucher ?
C'est génial.
Regarde ce que ces abrutis
ont sorti comme portrait-robot.
Descends-le un peu.
Veuillez patienter.
- Je te le dis...
- Bordel de merde.
...c'est pas ça le problème.
J'essaie juste
de rendre mon district vivable.
Je sacrifie quelques coins,
mais je sauve le reste.
Vous êtes comme l’aveugle avec l’éléphant.
C'est bien plus gros
que ce que vous touchez
- et vous ne le voyez pas.
- Voir quoi ?
Que vous êtes le maire
de la Cour des Miracles.
Où est l’eau potable ?
Où sont les toilettes,
le chauffage, l’électricité ?
Qui distribue des seringues propres
et des préservatifs ?
Où sont les soins palliatifs ?
La moitié de ces gens meurt debout,
et l’autre moitié va être contaminée.
C'est pas pire
que quand ils étaient dispersés.
- Maintenant, ils sont au même endroit.
- Cet endroit, c'est l’enfer.
Écoutez, je suis flic.
Je peux arrêter les gens
ou les virer de la rue.
Si vous cherchez plus que ça,
vous êtes au mauvais endroit.
Yo, mets-lui des cheveux
un peu plus raides.
Plus longs. Avec une frange.
Ça, c'est de la meuf.
Mets-lui des yeux bridés, comme Beyoncé.
- Remonte-lui les pommettes.
- Non, mec, c'est trop.
Elle a la tête toute plate maintenant.
- Une seconde.
- Ouais, c'est ça.
- Les lèvres un peu plus grosses.
- Je me la taperais bien.
Ouais.
C'est possible de faire un portrait-robot
de cul ?
- Quoi ?
- Elle a de la gueule.
Salut.
Ça va ? On cherche des informations
concernant un achat.
Plusieurs portables Trac achetés
par un Noir. Il y a environ une semaine.
Oh, ce type-là.
Il vient toutes les deux semaines.
La dernière fois, c'était huit téléphones.
Presque 900 $ .
Ça fait beaucoup de Ring Dings ?
- Des Ring Dings ?
- Une blague entre nous.
Vous gardez une trace des transactions ?
Cherchez et vous trouverez.
Un instant.
Attendez.
927,24 $ .
- On peut avoir la vidéo ?
- Non. Je la réutilise tous les jours.
- Je peux garder ça ?
- Oui.
On fait quoi, maintenant ?
On lui achète un lot de cassettes ?
On attend une semaine dans ce trou à rats,
en espérant que ce type revienne ?
COOPÉRATIVE ALIMENTAIRE
Je dois faire quelque chose,
je veux pas replonger.
Je veux contrôler ma vie, vous voyez ?
- Reprendre le dessus.
- Je sais pas, un truc.
- Essayez de vous discipliner.
- Ça ou autre chose.
Si je vous disais
qu'on trouve une certaine libération
non dans la discipline ou le contrôle,
mais dans l’abandon ?
De quel genre d'abandon vous parlez ?
Oh, ce genre-là.
Sans vous offenser,
vous pouvez arrêter tout de suite.
Je ne fais pas ça pour moi, je ne crois pas.
J'aimerais que ce soit plus que ça.
Mais si j'analyse bien,
c'est dû pour la moitié
Le major Colvin reconnaît lui-même
la possibilité
d'une variation statistique
dans la lecture des statistiques mensuelles.
Une variation ?
Messieurs, si je lis le rapport
sur le district ouest,
y trouverai-je moins de crimes
ou plus d'incidents
qui ont été minimisés ou infondés ?
Parce que ce genre de variation
sent la manipulation à plein nez,
et si j'ai tort,
si vraiment il n'y a pas de manipulation,
j'aimerais savoir ce que le major Colvin
a appris et que le reste de vous
n'a pas retenu.
Je vous assure
qu'il n'y a pas de manipulation.
Nous ne faisons pas cela.
Je ne le fais pas.
Et je ne le permettrai pas à mes hommes.
Nous pensons
que c'est une véritable aberration.
Et si cela se répète le mois prochain,
il faudra examiner cela
de plus près. Sinon...
Bien, passons à autre chose.
Où en est l’assistance aux témoins ?
Le service a-t-il assez d'argent
pour protéger avant les procès
les témoins qui sont en danger ?
Nous avons les ressources
que la ville peut fournir, j'en suis sûr.
Vous n'êtes pas en position
de critiquer le maire.
- Je ne me le permettrais pas.
- J'espère bien.
Je vais vous poser une question.
Qu'est-ce que la ville est prête à payer
pour permettre aux citoyens ordinaires
de venir au tribunal
et de faire leur devoir en témoignant
contre des gangsters et des criminels ?
Quelles ressources
sont comparables à cet engagement ?
MAINTENANT ?
Vous pouvez jouer les bons petits soldats,
mais je dis officiellement
que cette administration
a fui ses responsabilités
et n'a pas protégé les citoyens
qui ont pris cet engagement
et mis leurs vies
et leurs moyens d'existence en danger.
J'ajouterai que je suis d'accord
avec mon collègue,
cette administration a abandonné
cette communauté.
De la pire des manières.
Et nous devons agir à ce sujet.
Hé !
Vous êtes amis.
Vous êtes comme des frères.
Si vous oubliez ça,
vous oubliez ce qui est important. Allez.
Les gamins ont cassé un bon panier.
Celui qu'ils ont ressemble aux paniers
du début du siècle
mais ils y sont collés comme des morpions.
Je sais pas.
Je devrais peut-être organiser un tournoi.
Vous jouez au basket ?
Ça a jamais été mon truc.
J'étais bon avec mes mains.
- Boxeur ?
- Oui.
De la boxe ?
Je connais une salle
où vont certains gamins,
- mais c'est pas la porte à côté.
- J'aimerais aller y faire un tour.
Pour me faire une idée au moins.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe là-bas ?
La police a concentré l’action
dans deux ou trois quartiers.
Le diacre pense que certaines personnes
devraient remettre de l’ordre ici.
- Tu es une de ces personnes.
- L’une d'elles, oui.
- Roman.
- Dennis.
Tu devrais rester ici.
Laisse-moi parler seul à Buford Pusser.
Quoi ?
Et ça montre aux gens
que je connais mon métier.
Je tiendrai les gens pour responsables
en m'en tenant aux faits.
- Je parle de ce qui est juste.
- C'est reparti.
Quoi ?
Tu crois que la politique,
c'est avoir le dernier mot ?
Que celui qui a le bon argument
au bon moment l’emporte ?
Clinton et Kennedy avaient des arguments.
Et Reagan ?
Il n'en aurait jamais trouvé
même si sa vie en dépendait.
Il faut savoir utiliser les arguments.
Et quand tu en as,
tu es arrogant et tu attaques les gens.
- Oui...
- Clinton et Reagan,
quand ils prenaient la parole,
ils mettaient leur auditoire à l’aise
et en confiance.
Les gens les aimaient.
Les gens adoraient l’idée
que ces types les aimaient.
Tu dis que je ne suis pas sympathique ?
Jen ?
Quand tu es à la maison
et que tu parles avec moi,
que tu n'es ni au conseil
ni devant les caméras, tu es super.
Quand tu me dis
ce qui compte vraiment pour toi, je te crois.
Tu es malin, ambitieux,
et tu es un fabuleux orateur.
Tu sais retenir l’attention, faire rire
et tu sais remporter n'importe quel débat.
Tout ça est évident, Tommy.
Ça se voit
aux réunions municipales de Baltimore.
Mais si tu comptes devenir maire,
sénateur ou gouverneur un jour...
Montre-leur plus que ça.
Baltimore ?
J'y suis allé avec ma femme
pour notre anniversaire de mariage.
- J'ai payé 12 $ pour deux bières.
- Putain, c'est pas donné.
Tout fout le camp dans cette ville.
- La faute à qui ?
- À qui ?
À votre avis ?
À la police, à la mairie, à la justice.
Quelle justice ?
Vous savez comment on appelle ça
quand le juge, le jury et l’inculpé
sont au tribunal ?
- Une réunion de famille.
- Sans déconner.
Les Blancs qui vont au tribunal
serrent les fesses.
Et c'est là que tout le monde
parle de justice.
Les jeter en prison, ils n'attendent que ça.
Enfin, ils ne sont pas tous si mal que ça.
En fait, il y en a beaucoup de bien.
Je suis à la radio si tu as besoin de moi.
Ma femme, Carol-Ann.
- Même des très bien.
- Y a-t-il quoi que ce soit
que je puisse faire pour vous, inspecteur ?
Ou est-ce juste une visite de courtoisie ?
Je devrais vous présenter ma coéquipière.
Vous allez l’adorer.
On n'arrive pas à l’avoir.
Il va falloir utiliser des méthodes
moins conventionnelles.
Que Devonne s'en occupe.
J'ai ça concernant un autre problème.
- C'est qui ?
- Tu te rappelles Fatface Rick ?
Il allait à des réunions avec String.
C'est sa cousine, Trina.
- Trina, celle qui a le bon gros cul.
- En plein dans le mille.
C'est son numéro au boulot.
Tu sais où elle bosse en ce moment ?
Elle bosse au service social.
Tu crois qu'Omar touche une aide ?
Non, pas en ce moment.
Mais à une époque,
avant qu'un idiot donne une arme
à Omar Little,
cet enfoiré était bien le fils de quelqu'un.
Alors dans leurs dossiers,
ils doivent bien avoir les noms
d'un parent d'Omar. Tu me suis ?
T'es sûr que tu veux qu'on s'occupe
d'Omar et de Marlo ?
Omar s'en est plus pris à nous
depuis qu'on a tué sa pute.
- Peut-être que...
- Écoute, c'est moi qui vois, Charles.
Quoi de neuf ?
Tu t'occupes des affaires, String ?
Moi aussi, mec. Moi aussi.
- L’est n'était pas prêt pour nous.
- Tu m'étonnes.
Oui, je sais que BaBa Jani
réutilise ses bandes tous les jours.
Ça me les brise à moi aussi.
Il a un problème avec les gosses de l’école.
Tous les jours, après les cours, ils y vont,
l’occupent au comptoir
et volent les revues de bagnoles et d'armes.
Ses bandes sont si mauvaises
qu'on a l’impression de regarder
une tempête de neige.
Mais j'ai demandé à Bob, mon assureur,
de tourner sa caméra
en direction du parking de BaBa.
Maintenant, quand j'ai un vrai problème,
je viens chez Bob et je regarde sa cassette.
Je vous en ferai une copie demain matin.
Dites-moi, votre coéquipier...
C'est un sacré connard.
- C'est vrai ?
- Oui.
Lève ta main droite.
Tu sais ce que c'est ?
C'est une morale plutôt douteuse.
C'est le monde à l’envers,
on traite ces abrutis de dealers
comme des princes.
T'as vu comme les rues sont tranquilles ?
Dans chaque secteur,
on a moitié moins de problèmes.
Merde. C'est mal, c'est mal.
Parce qu'avant, c'était bien,
on s'en tirait mieux ?
Et c'est quoi la réponse de Colvin ?
Aider les petits dealers ? Leur filer du blé ?
Colvin ? Ça a toujours été un bon flic.
Alors il doit savoir comme ça fait mal
de se lever chaque matin pour ça.
C'est pareil pour lui.
Il faudrait dire ça au haut commandement.
- Ou aux journaux.
- Je peux vous poser une question ?
Quand vous avez eu des problèmes,
Colvin n'est pas monté au feu pour vous ?
Il essaie quelque chose.
C'est dur à encaisser, mais ça marche.
Après 30 ans de maison,
il mérite un peu de marge de manœuvre.
Et puis merde.
Ce truc ne durera pas de toute façon.
Et quand on voudra s'attaquer
à Hamsterdam,
ils retourneront
dans leurs rues habituelles.
Si jamais on s'y attaque.
Je sais pas si ça se fera.
Je dis juste qu'on devrait le soutenir
autant qu'il nous a soutenus.
C'est ce que je pense.
Dès que le soleil se lève,
on récupère la bande et on se tire.
Cet endroit me donne envie de pleurer.
J'ai passé la moitié de mon mariage
dans ce genre de motels.
- Comment t'as pu faire ça ?
- Quoi ?
- Passer ton temps à tromper ton ex.
- C'est simple.
Je lui disais
que je devais m'occuper d'une extradition.
Il y a eu beaucoup d'extraditions.
J'ai dû extrader environ 500 fugitifs
sur une période de trois ans.
- C'est pas ce que je voulais dire.
- D'accord.
Alors, tu es revenue chez toi ?
Je m'en suis pris plein la gueule,
mais ça va.
Je suis même pas sûre de vouloir revenir.
Des extraditions ?
- Cheryl a dû voir clair dans ton petit jeu.
- Non, c'est simple.
Tu éteins ton portable
pour qu'elle tombe sur ton coéquipier.
Il lui dit: "Kima est au tribunal »
ou quelque chose comme ça.
Il te rappelle au motel et te tient au jus,
tu rappelles ta femme,
histoire d'aller aux nouvelles.
Les lits ne vibrent même pas,
pas de massage ce soir.
Je suis très bon pour les massages.
- Pour quoi ?
- Pour les massages.
Tu me connais.
- C'est une arnaque ?
- Non, c'est éducatif.
Cet enseignement est payant ou gratuit ?
Le prix à payer sera rendu au décuple
en sagesse.
Et puis, rien au monde ne coûte plus
que la gratuité.
C'est tout.
On double la mise.
Non, je n'aime pas prendre l’argent
d'un homme d'église.
- On triple la mise.
- À vous de commencer.
Il faut qu'on parle un peu plus
d'Hamsterdam.
J'ai jamais dit que c'était beau à voir.
Et c'est rien de le dire.
Il faut qu'on parle.
J'ai une réunion du service statistiques.
Je passerai plus tard.
- On a les autorisations.
- Oui, cette semaine.
B&B ENTR.
APPARTS DE LUXE
- Bien.
- Regardez-le.
- Qui ?
- Chunky Coates.
- C'est qui ?
- Vous ne connaissez pas Chunky ?
Il a des propriétés dans le quartier
et du côté de Paca Street.
Quand j'ai connu ce gros sac,
son bureau était si petit
qu'il fallait en sortir pour respirer.
Et il y a deux ans, il s'est mis à bosser
avec votre collègue, Clay Davis.
Regardez-moi cet enfoiré de gros cul.
C'est mieux ?
L’agent spécial Fitzhugh,
si c'est bien votre vrai nom.
Le F.B.I. Est sur l’affaire ?
On m'apprécie juste pour mes gadgets.
Lester m'a appelé, je l’ai livré.
Tu as la bande ?
Datée du 10-10-04. 15 h 04 et 30 secondes
à l’horloge de la caisse.
Maman Barksdale ?
La mère de D'Angelo.
Elle a appelé McNulty à propos
de la pendaison de son fils en prison.
C'est pour ça qu'elle nous appelle ?
Vous êtes Briana ? Exact.
Vous avez appelé à propos de votre fils.
Je vous rappelle.
Il n'y a rien à en tirer.
C'est si petit.
Aucun simple mortel ne peut...
Vous avez vu ce qu'il a fait ?
Quoi ? Il vient de recommencer.
Mais qui est cet homme ? D'où vient-il ?
Quelqu'un peut l’arrêter ?
Je vous en prie, ne nous faites pas de mal.
Mes yeux !
C'est si gros, si lisible et si clair.
Je suis à la criminelle.
Vous me faites peur parfois,
vous savez ça ?
Dans mon monde,
tu sais par quoi j'ai dû passer
pour être à ma place aujourd'hui ?
Quand je te dis que je suis prêt,
tu ferais mieux de me croire.
Grâce à l’utilisation des ressources
et à une plus forte présence policière,
et en étant à l’écoute de la communauté,
nous avons pu avoir un impact significatif
dans ces quartiers,
- Sur quatre semaines.
- Major, je sais que je vous en ai fait baver,
quand la criminalité a augmenté
il y a quelques semaines,
et vous allez utiliser vos statistiques
pour vous venger, non ?
Plutôt mesquin de votre part.
Sérieusement, Bunny,
le conseil municipal me pose des questions
Nous voulons juste faire plaisir au maire,
pas aller en taule.
Parfois, les dieux répondent aux prières.
Pas dans le district ouest, ils s'en tapent.
Lieutenant Daniels ?
- Monsieur ?
- Le mérite vous en revient ?
Vos unités ont travaillé dans ce district.
Nous n'avons que peu progressé.
Les bandes qui nous intéressent
sont toujours en pleine guerre.
Incroyable. La criminalité baisse
et personne ne veut recevoir les lauriers.
Qu'est-ce qui cloche ici ?
Vous n'aurez pas d'objections
si je fais réexaminer vos chiffres ?
Assurez-vous qu'une virgule
ne manque pas entre le un et le deux.
Vérifiez les chiffres.
Vous verrez qu'ils sont corrects.
Je vous ai appelé car j'ai appris
que vous aviez été voir Donette.
Mon fils ne se serait peut-être pas suicidé ?
- Est-ce exact ?
- C'est ce que je lui ai dit.
D'Angelo s'est pendu.
Pas avec la ceinture
qu'il avait autour du cou.
La distance entre la poignée et le sol
n'était pas assez grande.
Qu'insinuez-vous ?
- Ce que j'insinue ?
- Non.
Personne n'aurait osé.
- Mon frère, son oncle, aurait...
- Je suis d'accord avec vous.
Personne n'aurait osé.
À moins que...
- Avon était l’oncle de D'Angelo.
- Son oncle, c'est ça.
Ce n'est que votre idée, non ?
- Quelqu'un d'autre pense ça ?
- Non, il n'y a que moi.
- Ça n'intéresse personne d'autre.
- Je vois.
D'habitude, en prison,
quand quelqu'un vous en veut,
il fonce, il utilise un couteau fait "maison’.
C'est rapide, on n'en parle plus.
D'Angelo a été étranglé, ça a été prémédité.
Il faut attendre le bon moment,
sans personne autour.
Je suis désolé d'avoir remué tout ça,
parce que franchement,
personne ne va se bouger pour ça.
Celui qui l’a tué
voulait déguiser le meurtre en suicide,
mais les flics sont heureux,
ça fait une affaire en moins.
Et puis, le procureur Anne Arundel
n'en a rien à foutre.
Je ne suis pas censé m'y intéresser, alors...
Votre fils a dû
se retrouver entre deux bandes rivales.
Entre quelles bandes rivales ?
Écoutez, il y a deux ans,
on avait plus de lignes
sur la bande de votre frère que AT&T,
à la fin, D'Angelo allait retourner sa veste,
il allait balancer tout le monde.
Mais le saviez, non ?
C'est vous qui êtes allée le voir en prison
pour lui dire de laisser tomber.
J'aimais bien votre fils.
Tout bien considéré, c'était un brave gosse.
Et ça me fout en l’air
que personne ne l’ait soutenu.
On dirait bien que ça n'arrivera plus.
Mais maintenant,
je suis désolé d'avoir dérangé sa copine
et je suis désolé qu'elle vous ait dérangée.
Pourquoi être allé la voir ?
- Pourquoi pas moi d'abord ?
- Je peux être franc ?
Je cherchais quelqu'un
qui s'intéressait à ce gamin.
Comme je l’ai dit, c'est vous
qui l’avez persuadé de purger sa peine.

Tu arrives à y croire ?
Pas de violence,
tout se passe au grand jour.
Non, non, non, mec. Tout ça ?
C'est trop parfait.
Ça ressemble à une mise en scène
Il y a sûrement un flic
derrière chaque fenêtre.
Tu crois à tout ça ? C'est que tu rêves.
On rentre à la maison.
Je vais te dire un truc,
garde la tête sur les épaules,
ou tu vas nous envoyer en taule
tous les deux.
- Tu regardes quoi ?
- Toi.
Ah ouais ?
J'aime bien tes yeux.
On dirait des yeux de chat.
- T'es venue avec qui ?
- Avec eux.
C'est tout ?
À quel genre de chat ?
- Quoi ?
- J'ai les yeux de quel chat ?
D'un gros chat.
- T'es venue avec eux et c'est tout ?
- C'est ce que j'ai dit.
- Tu veux danser ?
- Oh, non.
- Tu veux boire un verre ?
- Non plus.
Tu veux quoi ?

C'est un marché de la drogue

Non, ce n'est pas officiellement approuvé.
C'est plutôt toléré.
C'est pour cela qu'on s'adresse
aux associations
et pas au service de santé.
Échange de seringues, prévention,
préservatifs, dépistage du sida.
Impossible de toucher un plus large public.
Si la ville n'est pas au courant, ça rend ça...
- Compliqué.
- Du moins temporairement.
Attention aux bijoux de famille.
C'était bien.
Moi, ça m'allait.
- Tu es libre demain ?
- Demain ?
Tu pourrais venir chez moi.
Il n'y a personne, à part ma grand-mère.
On aura un vrai lit.
On pourra prendre notre temps.
Donne-moi ton numéro.
J'ai pas choisi demain pour te presser,
mais après-demain,
je vais voir ma tante en Floride.
On se voit demain,
que ça me fasse un truc sympa
à me remémorer pendant le voyage en bus.
Après toi.
- C'est quoi ton nom, déjà ?
- Devonne.
Ce mec se farcit le voyage
tous les cinq jours.
- Ça fait un paquet de portables.
- Je comprends pas.
Ils faisaient gaffe à éparpiller les achats

Parce que Russell est un homme bien.
Il est prêt à se lancer.
- Alors, qu'il se lance pour vous.
- Attendez.
Attendez un instant.
Vous ne savez pas à qui vous avez affaire.
Vous savez qui c'est ?
Tu es prêt à cravacher ? Alors, ça marche.

En ce qui concerne l’argent fédéral,

T'en penses quoi ?
Je sais pas.
C'est peut-être un coup fourré.
J'ai besoin que tu ailles là-bas
me faire un topo de la situation.
- Où est mon frère ?
- Ferme la porte.
- On est en guerre. Il est assez occupé.
- Il faut que je le voie.
Il a pas son portable.
Dès que je le vois,
je lui transmets le message.
J'arrive pas à croire à ces conneries.
Écoute.
J'ai parlé à un flic.
Il m'a dit que D a été assassiné.
Oh, ça doit être McNulty.
Comment tu le sais ?
Levy pensait que tu goberais pas
ces conneries,
mais apparemment, si.
- Je dois voir mon frère.
- Calme-toi.
Cet enfoiré de flic...
Il essaie de nous diviser.
Tu ne le vois pas ?
J'imagine comme c'est dur pour une mère
d'avoir à gérer des trucs pareils.
En prison,
ils rendent la vie difficile aux Blacks.
D a choisi un moyen de sortir plus vite.
On peut rien y faire.
Comment protéger un homme
de lui-même ?
Où est Avon ? Je vais aller le voir.
Je te l’ai dit. On se bat pour des rues.
Dès que je lui parle,
je lui transmets le message, c'est promis.
Un flic devrait pas jouer
avec l’amour d'une mère.
Personne ne le devrait.
Je vais prendre quatre sandwiches
à la truite, un avec de la mayo,
un avec de la sauce piquante
et ketchup pour les autres.
Et quatre sodas à l’orange.
Le Lac aux Truites - Vente à emporter
Un drôle de mec a commandé

- Cette seringue a une valeur sentimentale.
- Voilà de l’eau oxygénée.

et tu peux y aller.
On échange vos seringues.

Dis aux autres filles de passer.
Attends.
Donne ça autour de toi, d'accord ?
J'ai plus de beurre de cacahuètes.
T'as autre chose ?
- Tu me prends pour ta bonniche ?
- Pour qui ?
Quand on arrêtera ces conneries,
je viendrai te botter le...
Approche-toi doucement.
Merde !
Mon Dieu !
- T'es touché ?
- Non.
Avance, enfoiré, on se barre d'ici !
Ton type a intérêt à être aussi bon
qu'il le dit. Ou que tu le dis.
Si tu as toujours cette mentalité,
alors tu n'es vraiment pas prêt.
- String...
- Pas maintenant.
- C'est Avon.
- Ferme la porte.
C'est parti.
Je te tiendrai au courant.
- Quoi ?
- Avon a été blessé.
- Où ?
- À l’épaule.
Tater a été tué. Avon respire encore.
Mais Briana me lâche pas la grappe.
Je dois lui dire.
- Qu'elle crève.
- Quoi ?
Je veux pas la voir, tu m'entends ?
Si tu me recouds comme tu fais
avec les clebs, tu seras le prochain patient.
- Sans déconner ?
- Quoi, ma peau t'inspire pas ?
Marlo !

Anthony. Vous êtes où ?
Au rez-de-chaussée, au 1034 North Mount.
Bien.
Ils s'attendent à des représailles massives.
S'ils attendent ça,
ils vont pouvoir attendre longtemps.
- Laissons-les mijoter un peu.
- On doit parler.
Attends.
Il doit sortir dans la rue,
c'est comme ça qu'il gagne du blé.
Qui a le plus gros trésor ?
Avon ?
- On passe directement à l’action, hein ?
- Tu veux quoi ?
- La "guerre", je croyais que c'était fini.
- J'avais oublié.
Je savais que j'avais oublié un truc.
On est les frères Trump.
Si t'arrêtes pas ces conneries,
tu vas foutre en l’air tout ce qu'on a fait.
Tu parles !
Tu connais la différence entre toi et moi ?
Mon sang est rouge, le tien est vert.
Tu as fait quoi pour nous ?
Tu sais ce que je vois quand je te regarde ?
Un mec complètement paumé.
Pas assez dur pour être ici. Et peut-être,
- pas assez malin pour eux.
- Pas assez dur ?
Ne le prends pas mal,
mais tu l’as jamais été.
- Tu as du talent, c'est sûr, mais...
- Quoi ?
Juste parce que je tire pas dans le tas,
je suis pas assez dur ?
Je suis pas un dur parce que je réfléchis
avant de tuer quelqu'un ?
Tuer quelqu'un ?
Tu as tué qui, hein ?
Tu sais, Briana est allée au central,
elle a vu un inspecteur.
Ce mec essaie de lui faire croire
que D'Angelo ne s'est pas suicidé.
Et alors ?
Il a pas tort.
Quoi ?
Oui.
Je savais que tu pourrais pas le faire,
et Briana marcherait pas.
Mais il devait mourir, Avon.
J'ai pris ce poids sur mes épaules,
parce que cet enfoiré allait nous balancer !
Il avait 20 ans à tirer.
S'il parlait, Briana, toi et moi on plongeait.
Jamais de la vie. Oh, non !
Je sais qu'il était de la famille.
Tu l’aimais bien.
Mais si tu veux parler
des liens familiaux sacrés,
va le faire ailleurs !
Ce petit con nous aurait tous fait plonger,
à commencer par toi, gros dur !
Il allait tous nous baiser !
Laisse-moi me relever.
Laisse-moi me relever.
Oh, merde.
<i>- Allô.
- Salut, comment ça va ?</i>
Salut.
<i>- Tu dormais ?
- Non.</i>
<i>- T’es pas content de m’entendre ?
- Si, ça me fait plaisir.</i>
<i>J’ai envie de te voir.</i>
<i>- Maintenant ?
- Oui, maintenant.</i>
<i>- Tu es oů ?
- Au męme endroit qu’avant.</i>
Au Peabody.
<i>- Tu es sűr que tu ne dormais pas ?
- Non, j'étais réveillé.</i>
<i>Menteur. Allez, rapplique.</i>
<i>D’accord. Allez, pourquoi pas.</i>
<i>- Chambre 210.
- Ça marche.</i>
- Sean, Seanie.
- Quoi ?
Je dois aller voir quelqu'un,
pas longtemps.
Je serai de retour dans une heure ou deux.
Je t'écris mon numéro de portable.
Je le laisse sur l’étagčre du haut,
ça marche ?
Qu'est-ce que j'ai dit ?
Tu vas voir quelqu'un,
ton numéro est sur l’étagčre du haut.
C'est bien.
<i>Les démocrates ont gagné du terrain
en faisant de l’emploi et de l’économie</i>

<i>ŕ affronter le terrorisme et l’Irak.</i>
Quelles conneries !
Seule l’économie importe
dans les États républicains.
Ça fait des mois que je dis ça.
Je ne t'ai pas dit de partir si tôt.
J'ai rien ŕ faire demain.
C'est moi qui choisis de partir.
Je dois rentrer chez moi.
C'est pas que ça m'a pas plu,
mais ça serait sympa de dîner avant.
Dîner et aller au ciné.
- Je suis arrivée tard ŕ Baltimore.
- La prochaine fois.
On parle, aprčs on baise comme des lapins.
Je suis pas un mec facile.
Tu as besoin d'ętre dorloté, McNulty ?
Je préfčre un rendez-vous,
pour pas me sentir comme un gigolo.
Un rendez-vous ?
Je t'appellerai.
Pendant la journée.

BALTIMORE CAPITALE DU CRIME
"...en attendant des moments
qui n'arrivent jamais’ - Freamon
- Vous ętes bien occupé, ŕ ce que je vois.
- Oui, on avance.
Vous ętes bien habillé.
On est dimanche matin,
je vais écouter la bonne parole.
C'est vous qui payez ces types ?
La chaudičre marche,
les canalisations sont en bon état.
Tout devrait ętre nettoyé d'ici demain,
je crois.
Il vous faudra juste les autorisations.
- Les autorisations ?
- Oui. Les autorisations.
- Yo, c'était lui ?
- Merde.
Si c'est pas lui,
ça fera qu'une balle de gâchée.
Le seul problčme,
c'est que c'est dimanche matin, tu vois ?
- T'appelles qui ?
- Slim Charles.
T'as dit qu'on parlerait de nos problčmes
en groupe.
Le problčme,
c'est que tu fais la guerre ŕ Marlo.
Marlo fait pas partie du groupe.
De toute maničre, toutes ces fusillades
sont mauvaises pour les affaires.
Les flics occupent
la moitié du quartier ouest.
Et lŕ oů ils sont pas,
je peux pas avoir des gars qui ont peur
de crever pour avoir été pris
pour des mecs de Barksdale.
Écoute, j'ai voulu lui parler
en personne, mais...
Va parler ŕ Avon.
Le problčme sera ŕ moitié résolu.
Ça fait pas de doute.
- Ouais.
- Exactement.
Je suis d'accord.
Cet enfoiré dort sűrement.
Stringer, Avon doit accepter
cette nouvelle façon de penser.
Tu pourrais lui rappeler que,
comme tout le monde ici,
il bénéficie de mes contacts
et des prix de gros
- qu'on a en s'associant.
- Il le sait, ça va, Joe.
On a un petit quelque chose
ŕ lui demander.
Il faut qu'il lâche l’affaire
et qu'il laisse ses rues ŕ Marlo.
T'as dit toi-męme
qu'il s'agissait pas de territoires.
- Chassez le naturel...
- C'est qui ?
C'est moi.
On est devant la maison
oů se trouve le mec, tu sais...
- Parle.
- Putain, j'évite de donner des noms.
C'est Gérard.
On attend Omar, il va sortir de la maison.
J'ai pas envie d'avoir moins d'hommes
dans les rues
mais c'est donnant-donnant.
Vas-y, parle.
Gérard et Sapper ont repéré Omar.
Ils ont appelé Slim, mais il répond pas.
- Et alors ?
- C'est le jour du Seigneur.
On est dimanche matin.
- Ils sont sűrs que c'est lui ?
- C'est Omar.
Qu'ils s'occupent de lui.
Allez-y.
Gérard. Ils sont juste lŕ, viens.
On y est.
Oh, mon Dieu ! Mon Dieu !
Cette fois, je l’ai eu, c'est sűr.
Une telle baisse de la criminalité ici,
c'est du jamais vu.
Dieu seul sait ce qui se passera
quand votre secret filtrera.
Ce qui doit arriver arrivera.
S'ils veulent continuer ma petite expérience
ou s'ils veulent bosser comme avant,
ça ne tient qu'ŕ eux. Moi ?
C'est fini, je m'en vais. Il y a aussi Hopkins.
J'ai reçu une offre de travail
dans la sécurité.
- Vous allez vraiment arręter ?
- C'était prévu.
Quoi ?
Vous avez commencé un truc.
Vous allez pas le finir ?
- C'est-ŕ-dire ?
- Ŕ la guerre, pas la peine
d'essayer d'aider les gens.
Mais vous avez instauré une tręve, Bunny.
Et rendre le trafic de drogue légal
donne ŕ ce succčs un goűt amer.
N'abandonnez pas,
on va finir par convaincre
Vous ętes fort pour ça.
Qu'est-ce qui se passera
ŕ l’arrivée de votre remplaçant ?
Et si les gens apprennent ça,
qui va monter au créneau ? Hein ?
- Et le contraste ?
- Pour filmer de jour, ça va.
T'es sűr ?
Putain, Lester,
tu viens le dimanche maintenant ?
Je pourrais dire la męme chose de toi.
Elena emmčne les gosses chez sa mčre,
je vais faire quoi ?
Pas de vie, pas de mariage, pas de gosses.
Pas de problčmes.
C'est quoi cette caméra ?
On va la placer derričre une fenętre
en face du magasin de Stringer.
On verra les allées et venues.
- Tu as besoin d'aide ?
- Ils te connaissent.
Prez et moi allons le faire un dimanche,
quand le magasin est fermé,
on passera pour des ouvriers.
Tu sais quoi, Lester ? Il y a pas cinq pelés
dans notre service capables de faire ça.
Je veux pas avoir l’air arrogant.
Mais quand on y réfléchit bien,
il y a peut-ętre 3000 agents assermentés.
Tu enlčves une centaine de chefs
qui en branlent pas une.
Quelques autres centaines de sergents
et de lieutenants.
Et la plupart veulent devenir chefs,
alors ils servent ŕ que dalle.
Aprčs ça,
tu comptes 600 ou 700 gratte-papiers.
Des ronds de cuir. Et les patrouilles ?
Lls sont sűrement pas tous ŕ jeter,
mais vu l’état dans lequel est la ville,
c'est 1500 mecs qui sont occupés
ŕ prendre les appels et ŕ nettoyer les rues.
Personne ne connaît son boulot
et personne ne fait rien.
Idem pour la police judiciaire.
Prendre les appels, boucler les affaires
au plus vite, rien de compliqué.
Qui est capable de bosser comme on le fait
sur une affaire ?
Combien de mecs en sont capables ?
Don Worden, Ed Burns et Gary Childs
dans ce comté,
John O'Neil et Steve Cleary ŕ Woodland.
Ils sont bons, mais peu nombreux.
Ils sont pas beaucoup.
On est bons pour ça, Lester.
Ici, il n'y a pas mieux que nous.
- On est de vrais flics.
- Tu m'étonnes.
Dis-moi un truc, Jimmy.
Comment tu penses que ça va se finir ?
- C'est-ŕ-dire ?
- Un défilé ? Une montre en or ?
Un grand moment pour Jimmy McNulty,
quand tu bouclerais une affaire,
tout le monde dirait ŕ l’unisson:
"Merde, il avait raison depuis le début.
On aurait dű l’écouter."
Le boulot ne te sauvera pas, Jimmy.
Ça ne te rendra pas heureux,
il te manquera quelque chose.
- Je sais pas. Une bonne affaire...
- A une fin. Elles ont toutes une fin.
On menotte un type et c'est terminé,
et le lendemain,
c'est toi que tu as en face dans la glace.
Jusqu'ŕ l’affaire suivante.
Il faut t'accrocher ŕ autre chose
qu'au boulot.
Comme quoi ? Une maison de poupée ?
Hé, hé, hé. Vivre.
Vivre, Jimmy, tu sais ce que ça veut dire ?
C'est ce qui se passe en attendant
des moments qui n'arrivent jamais.
- Un dimanche matin ?
- On a appelé pour demander.
Shamrock nous a dit d'y aller.
Un dimanche matin, tas de connards,
alors qu'il emmenait
sa putain de grand-mčre ŕ l’église.
Et vous l’avez męme pas buté ?
Vous avez juste bousillé le chapeau ?
Le temps que Sham nous donne le feu vert,
Omar était monté.
Comme si ça suffisait pas
de violer la tręve du dimanche matin.
Non ! Je tiens ŕ la main le galurin déchiré
d'une soi-disant femme de couleur.
Vous savez ce que c'est, une femme
de couleur ? Pas vos mčres, c'est sűr.
Si c'étaient des Blacks,
vous auriez fait autre chose
que ces conneries.
Vous ętes en train de déconner
avec le réputation d'Avon Barksdale.
Vous le savez ?
Elle va bien, au moins ?
Elle a une coupure au visage
et elle a mal oů je lui suis tombé dessus.
Ŕ part ça, ça va.
Tu lui as sauvé la vie, hein ?
Elle a failli se faire tuer.
T'aurais dű me voir ŕ l’hôpital
quand ils la recousaient,
j'ai dű lui mentir
pour lui expliquer ce qui s'était passé.
Elle croit que je bosse dans une cafétéria.
- Une cafétéria ?
- Oui, ŕ l’aéroport.
Ŕ l’aéroport ? Pourquoi lŕ ?
Parce que je sais
qu'elle va jamais manger lŕ-bas.
Hé, Kimmy, c'est pas drôle.
Cette femme m'a élevé !
Depuis que je suis adulte, je vais ŕ l’église
avec elle une fois par mois.
Je pensais
que j'avais pas de souci ŕ me faire,
que personne dans cette ville de merde
attaquerait un dimanche matin.
Vous saviez que j'allais laisser tomber ?
Vous le saviez ?
Aprčs la mort de Tosha,
j'allais laisser les gens tranquilles.
- Avon est de retour.
- Barksdale doit y passer.
Et Stringer aussi.
Il faut arręter les conneries !
Je le jure devant Dieu, un dimanche matin,
ils ont bousillé son plus beau chapeau.
Ces enculés n'ont pas honte !
Vous me suivez ?
Sans moi.
Si tu t'en prends au gang de Barksdale,
compte pas sur moi.
Je fais ça pour le blé.
C'est plus simple comme ça.
Juste toi et moi, alors.
Comme au bon vieux temps.
Non. Ce coup-ci, c'est personnel.
- Ça concerne que moi.
- Je suis avec toi.
Pas sur ce coup-lŕ.
Bon, les gars.
On est tout prčs de mettre ces types
sur écoute.
On a juste ŕ monter un dossier
prouvant que les portables jetables
sont utilisés pour un trafic.
McNulty et Greggs,
vous vous occupez de ça.
Envoyez une taupe
ou un indic avec un micro
dans le gang de Barksdale.
Lester, Prez et vous,
vous tapez les déclarations sous serment,
quand on aura la cause probable,
on fera la demande le plus vite possible.
Inspecteur, vous vous occupez de Bernard.
Vous le suivrez
quand il ira acheter des téléphones.
Plus vite on aura les numéros,
plus vite on commencera l’écoute.
Quand Caroline reviendra de vacances,
elle s'occupera de la mini-caméra.
Ŕ partir de lŕ, on pourra consigner
tous les mouvements de Stringer
et on gardera en męme temps
un śil sur Barksdale.
Faites-vous une idée
d'oů il passe ses journées.
Quant ŕ moi, je vais batailler
avec la compagnie du téléphone.
Ils posent problčme ?
Depuis que les portables ont été inventés.
Bien.
Souvenez-vous qu'avec cette écoute,
c'est une course contre la montre.
Tout ce qu'on a est temporaire.
- T'as parlé ŕ Bubbles ?
- Oui. Il nous attend ŕ Mount Clare.
- Oů est le rapport des numéros appelés ?
- Quoi ?
Le rapport.
Laisse tomber, je l’ai.
C'est tout le temps Stringer.
Theresa D'Agostino, s'il vous plaît.
<i>- Vous pouvez patienter ?
- Oui.</i>
<i>Je suis désolée, elle n’est pas lŕ.
Je prends un message ?</i>
Non, j'en ai déjŕ laissé un.
- Une salle de boxe ?
- Pour les gamins. Un club de sport.
"Salles de sport, saunas et bains publics
ne sont autorisés que dans les zones
"B2, B3, B4 ou B5."
Tous signés et scellés
par un architecte agréé...
Les plans du sol
avec la résistance ŕ la charge...
Les plans des canalisations.
Six exemplaires de votre plan incendie
avec les issues de secours
et les extincteurs indiqués.
La santé publique,
car la culture physique en dépend.
Un permis de la commission d'État
des sports, sur Calvert Street.
- Milieu ou haut de gamme ?
- Milieu de gamme.
Tu devrais prendre
une de ces grosses bagnoles.
Une avec une super radio.
Si on doit passer la journée
dans cette foutue bagnole, ça vaut le coup.
T-SHIRTS BLANCS
- T'es chatouilleux, Bubs ?
- Tu me donnes des frissons, Kima.
Voilŕ ce qu'il y a.
L’argent de la transaction, Bubs.
Rappelle-toi, tout sera enregistré.
Pigé.
Ils se donnent plus la peine
de cacher la dope, sur Vincent Street.
Tu surveilles,
t'attends qu'ils aient presque plus de came
et tu demandes 30 cachetons.
Assez pour qu'ils se réapprovisionnent.
C'est le plus important.
On veut qu'il utilise son portable.
- D'accord. Et je garde les 30 cachetons.
- Ça te tuerait, Bubs.
Tu pourras garder l’argent
quand tu seras revenu avec la came.
- Je demandais juste.
- Je te dis juste.
- Ça va ętre impossible.
- Pardon ?
L’activation d'information
que vous voulez ?
Ce n'est pas accessible
avant d'ętre passé par la facturation,
cela prend quelques jours,
parfois une semaine ou plus.
De plus, la police nous envoie
des dizaines de demandes chaque mois.
Nous les traitons dans l’ordre d'arrivée,
il y a 30 jours d'attente.
Trente jours ?
Je veux ętre sűre de bien saisir.
Votre société gagne de l’argent
en vendant des portables jetables
pour lesquels les clients
ne fournissent pas d'informations
- au moment de l’achat ?
- C'est exact.
Ils achčtent ces téléphones
et les utilisent anonymement
en prépayant les minutes...
Chez nos détaillants, oui.
Pendant qu'ils les utilisent anonymement,
dans quelque but que ce soit,
ils ne peuvent pas ętre contrôlés
par la police car votre société
met un mois ŕ répondre
ŕ une demande d'écoute du tribunal ?
- Nous faisons de notre mieux.
- Foutaises !
Vous savez que ces portables
sont utilisés par les dealers.
Lieutenant, nos téléphones prépayés
visent une clientčle jeune,
comme les étudiants, ils ne peuvent pas
se permettre un abonnement fixe.
Quel étudiant ne peut pas se payer ça ?
S'ils peuvent se payer des études,
ils peuvent se payer un portable.
Vous m'offensez.
Vous ętes en train de dire
que si par miracle nous sommes capables
de trouver le portable d'un dealer
et d'intercepter ses conversations,
il vous faudra un mois
pour mettre en place l’écoute ?
Si cela vous pose un problčme,
contactez notre avocat.
C'est tout ce que j'ai ŕ dire.
Que dites-vous de ça ?
Et si le procureur de Baltimore
tenait une conférence de presse
devant le tribunal pour déclarer
que Bay Wireless est de mčche
avec les trafiquants de drogue de la ville
et qu'ils empęchent leurs arrestations
par la police.
Quatre ŕ cinq jours d'attente.
On ne peut pas faire mieux.
J'avais l’impression d'ętre un ballon
avec de l’air lui sortant du cul
ŕ ętre envoyé de bureau en bureau.
C'est donc lui ?
- Frank Reid.
- Dennis Wise.
Révérend, Dennis a passé toute la journée
ŕ faire des demandes d'autorisations.
- Pour la salle de sport ?
- Oui.
Vous avez parlé de moi ?
Ou d'autres personnes ?
Ŕ une époque,
c'est la poudre que j'aurais fait parler.
Comment les gens normaux font ça
dans cette ville ?
Doreen, appelez le délégué Watkins,
s'il vous plaît.

Je reste dans le coin.
Dis-le ŕ tes amis, d'accord ?
Il fait trop chaud pour porter du noir.
- Qu'est-ce que t'as ŕ vendre ?
- Des body bags.
D'accord, donne-m'en 30. Trente cachetons.
Trente ? Oů est-ce qu'un pouilleux
comme toi
va trouver 300 $ en liquide, mec ?
Ça fait un bail que je vends ces t-shirts.
Je suis peut-ętre un pouilleux,
mais je me fais du blé.
Tu veux mon oseille ou pas ?
Ouais, on est ŕ sec. D'accord.
Ça va pas tarder.
Un achat de gros,
ça vaut bien une petite ristourne ?
- On dit 250 $ ?
- 275 $ .
- Plus deux t-shirts.
- Ça marche.
<i>- Ça marche.
- Bubs vient de se faire 25 $ .</i>
<i>- Theresa D'Agostino, s'il vous plaît.

<i>- Je peux prendre un message ?
- Non, je rappellerai.</i>
- Alors, comment ça va ?
- Quoi ?
- Ta nouvelle conquęte.
- Bien, pour l’instant.
- T'as les reçus ?
- La plupart.
Les autres ont volé par la fenętre
sur l’autoroute.
Vous attendez Avon ?
Il paraît que vous avez bousillé
le chapeau d'une vieille.
Bien, vous ętes tous lŕ.
On a du boulot.
Venez en haut, qu'on puisse parler.
J'ai les numéros.
- Combien ?
- 24 téléphones de chez Trac.
Deux venant des Mondo Mart de Catonsville
et Sykesville, quatre de Fredrick,
et huit venant de deux endroits
dans l’ouest de la Virginie.
Ces mouchards sont super.
- Il a pris l’autoroute 70.
- Il a pas tort. Le paysage est plus beau.
Vingt-quatre, hein ?
Il va y avoir un paquet de numéros appelés.
Avec de la chance,
un de ces téléphones
mčne ŕ Bodie Broadus.
- Tu appelles Pearlman ?
- D'accord.
Qui a faim ?
- Chinois, ça vous dit ?
- Ça m'a l’air bien.
- Passez commande, j'y vais.
- Je veux du lo mein.
Ŕ toi de taper ça, je l’accompagne.
- Un machin aigre-doux pour moi.
- Et pour moi, un lo mein.
On y va ?
Allez voir Charles,
il vous donnera les détails.
- C'est qui ?
- Des mecs du quartier est.
Ils veulent bosser pour nous.
Milton nous a mis en contact.
Tout va redevenir comme avant, String.
Je le sens.
On a juste ŕ s'occuper de ce Marlo
et ensuite, on reprend la rue.
Cette situation ne fait pas vraiment plaisir
aux mecs du groupe.
Ils disent qu'ils ont des flics
dans des rues tranquilles d'habitude.
- Tout le monde est nerveux.
- Qu'ils crčvent !
Prop Joe a dit qu'il jouerait les médiateurs.
Il ira parler ŕ Marlo.
S'il y va armé, ça pourra marcher.
Laisse-moi te poser une question.
Tu as dit ŕ ces connards qu'ils pouvaient
tuer la grand-mčre d'Omar ?
Sham est venu me voir
au milieu de la réunion
en me disant qu'ils avaient repéré Omar.
Ils ont jamais parlé de sa grand-mčre.
Ni de chapeau ou de ces trucs.
J'ai entendu son nom et j'ai dit: "Oui".
- Un dimanche matin ?
- Rien ŕ foutre, mec.
J'ai entendu son nom,
j'ai pas pensé ŕ l’église.
La tręve du dimanche
est aussi vieille que le business.
Tu peux faire
toutes les conneries que tu veux
et dire: "rien ŕ foutre",
mais pas un dimanche.
Les gens commencent ŕ parler,
ça devient de plus en plus gros.
Je te jure,
Fatface Rick a entendu que nos mecs
ont plombé
le cul de la grand-mčre d'Omar exprčs.
Et qu'ils ont sorti leurs bites
et pissé sur son chapeau.
J'ai entendu toutes ces conneries.
Prop Joe m'a passé un savon.
Tu veux que je dise quoi ?
Les mecs bien sont rares.
Sinon, tu crois que je paierais
des mecs du quartier est ?
Nos mecs ont quitté les rues ?
Oui.
On y retournera
quand on se sera occupé de Marlo.
On devrait peut-ętre envoyer
quelques équipes
dans les zones de non-droit
créées par les flics.
Tu me suis ?
Aller chercher le blé lŕ oů il est.
- Tu crois ŕ cette zone ?
- Jusqu'ŕ présent, oui.
Et s'ils veulent arręter ça,
ils n'auront rien de plus
qu'un petit chef de bande.
Tu vas faire quoi des deux cons
qui attendent en bas ?
Je vais les forcer ŕ acheter
un nouveau chapeau.
On attend quoi ? Le truc aigre-doux ?
Tu commences par le biscuit ?
Ça change quoi ?
"Un nouvel ami se fera connaître."
Un nouvel ami ?
Si c'était "une amie",
ça serait un bon présage.
Putain, je suis marié,
j'ai męme un salon de jardin.
Cette technologie est incontrôlable,
c'est sűr.
On le savait déjŕ.
De la maničre
dont ils utilisent ces portables,
on n'arrive pas ŕ avoir d'écoute ŕ temps.
Quand on arrive ŕ avoir
les informations du client...
Ils s'en débarrassent.
Les opérateurs leur disent
qu'il faut une semaine pour les papiers.
On ne leur fait pas peur.
Si on leur envoyait le F.B.I. ?
- Vous ętes en mesure de faire ça.
- Je ne sais pas.
S'ils vous ont dit cinq jours,
on ne peut pas faire mieux.
Je vous le répčte,
le F.B.I. Est occupé avec l’anti-terrorisme.
Et notre procureur
jouit rien qu'en pensant
ŕ la corruption politique.
Il se fout du trafic de drogue.
Je suis désolée.

<i>Unité 13. Dans la ruelle de derričre,

- C'est pas loin d'ici.
- On y va.
<i>Quelle est l’intersection ?</i>
<i>Des coups de feu.
Ŕ l’ouest de Milton, apparemment.</i>
Je suis flic !
Il est mort, signalez-le au central.
C'est un Glock.
J'ai vu l’arme quand il s'est tourné.
C'est Derrick ! Nom de Dieu !
Tu as tué Derrick. C'est Waggoner.
Putain, t'as tué Waggoner !
<i>- Greggs.
- Prez a tué un flic.</i>
Quoi ?
<i>Ŕ l’instant, un accident, dans une ruelle.</i>
<i>- Non.
- Je te rappelle.</i>
- C'est Barksdale qui t'envoie ?
- Je viens en paix.
- C'est en train de déraper.
- C'est pas Barksdale qui t'envoie ?
Non, Stringer sait que je suis ici.
Si je rapporte des bonnes nouvelles,
ils feront des concessions.
Dis ŕ Marlo qu'il peut intégrer le groupe.
S'il nous achčte notre came,
qui est dix fois meilleure que la sienne,
il gardera ses rues. C'est juré.
Ça peut l’intéresser. Mais il a ses idées.
Et il pense qu'Avon est affaibli.
T'as déjŕ vu Avon Barksdale
faire machine arričre ?
Un type en civil dans une ruelle sombre,
l’arme ŕ la main, des coups de feu signalés.
On ne cherche ŕ griller personne,
mais il faut prendre en compte
l’aspect racial.
- Ça ressemble ŕ...
- Il a vu un avocat ?
- Lieutenant.
- Quoi ?
On peut pas le forcer
ŕ faire une déclaration
sans lui avoir lu ses droits,
et ça n'a pas encore été fait...
Je suis son supérieur hiérarchique.
Je veux juste savoir s'il va bien.
D'accord, d'accord, c'est juste que...
C'est une question de droit, maintenant.
Je peux vous aider ?
Vous devriez faire appel au syndicat.
Prenez un avocat
avant de dire quoi que ce soit.
Je ne suis pas en train de dire
que vous allez ętre inculpé.
Tout le monde sait
que vous ne vouliez pas...
Mais d'un point de vue administratif,
vous devez faire attention
ŕ l’aspect racial de l’affaire.
Vous comprenez ça ?
Certaines personnes ici
vont voir les choses comme ça.
- Vous comprenez ça ?
- J'avais pas peur, j'étais pas en colčre.
J'en avais rien ŕ foutre
de la couleur de sa peau...
Ou peut-ętre que si.
Putain, comment on sait
si on a ça ŕ l’esprit ou pas ?
- Mais vous avez vu l’arme.
- Oui.
Oui, il a fait volte-face et...
Parce que vous avez crié ? Vous avez crié:
"Police", et il s'est retourné ?
Non, je ne crois pas.
Je ne crois pas avoir parlé.
Et lui non plus.
Je venais de pénétrer dans la ruelle,
il s'est retourné et j'ai vu l’arme.
C'est tout.
- Il avait des gosses ? Une femme ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Ils veulent pas me le dire.
Ils me disent rien de lui.
Contactez le syndicat.
Prenez un avocat, Roland.
Non.
C'est terminé pour moi.
Laissez l’avocat parler pour vous.
Lieutenant...
dites ŕ Lester que je suis désolé.
Appelez le syndicat. Il veut voir un avocat.
Quand il aura fini,
renvoyez-le chez lui avec quelqu'un.
Cette nuit, il pourrait vouloir se suicider.
Lieutenant. Vous allez le soutenir ?
Ce que je veux dire,
c'est que si cette affaire
devait prendre une tournure raciale,
vous ętes son supérieur,
il peut compter sur vous, n'est-ce pas ?
Ça va ?
C'est le lo mein.
Quel merdier !
- Waggoner était lŕ depuis quand ?
- Depuis six ans et demi.
Deux citations, 16e sur la liste
de promotion au poste de sergent.
Ŕ peu prčs l’opposé de l’abruti
qui est lŕ-dedans.
Tu connais ses antécédents ?
Une fois, il est devenu dingue
et a flingué sa voiture de patrouille.
Falsification de rapport,
mais Valchek a fait pression.
Tu sais qu'il est marié
ŕ la fille de Valchek ?
Ça lui fait un putain de passe-droit.
Huit connexions, les autres seront activées
quand l’opérateur aura reçu
nos assignations.
Bon boulot, inspecteur.
Et on cherche quoi ?
On espčre qu'un de ces téléphones
nous amčnera directement ŕ Bodie.
Qu'il appelle sa copine, sa grand-mčre.
Un des numéros qu'on a extraits.
Si on voit ça, c'est son téléphone.
On sait que c'est le sien
et qu'il s'en sert pour vendre de la drogue.
On sait tout ça.
Ensuite, on met en place une écoute
et on prie qu'il ne jette pas son portable.
Ça plairait ŕ Prez.
Je vais pas vous mentir.
La paperasse, j'y connais rien.
Mon truc, c'est la boxe.
J'ai pensé ŕ rien d'autre.
- Vous étiez boxeur ?
- Oui.
Mais j'ai pas suivi le bon chemin.
Le révérend Reid semble croire
en vos chances de réussite
ŕ éloigner certains de ces enfants de la rue.
Ça ne leur est pas venu ŕ l’esprit,
au central ?
Vous voulez établir votre salle de sport
dans le quatričme district.
La conseillčre municipale concernée
serait Eunetta Perkins.
Vous connaissez Mme Perkins ?
Peu d'entre nous la connaissent.
Peu d'entre nous.
Puisqu'on ne peut pas vraiment compter
sur Mme Perkins,
Mme Daniels ici présente ira avec vous.
Elle est ici parce que servir les électeurs
est la vie d'un conseiller municipal.
- Elle a besoin de voir cela.
- Je l’espčre.
Si je peux poser la question, M. Watkins,
pourquoi faites-vous cela ?
Savez-vous qui est le révérend Reid ?
Les électeurs de ma circonscription
le savent.
C'est arrivé aujourd'hui ?
Ça a merdé.
Je t'ai donné 250000 $
pour qu'ils te disent que mes papiers
suffisent pas ŕ me certifier
promoteur dans la zone d'entreprise ?
- Tu peux dire que ça a merdé.
- On s'est adressé aux bonnes personnes.
Laisse-moi les contacter,
je vais arranger ça.
- Contacte-les.
- Je m'en occupe, String.
Tu as la concession
des ampoules électriques. C'est bon.
Ça rapporte ŕ peine 30000 $ .
Je te parle des 250000 $ que tu as pris.
Tu appelles la poule aux śufs d'or
ou la pompe ŕ fric,
tu appelles qui tu veux,
je t'ai donné l’argent pour me lancer.
C'est pas un deal de drogue, String.
Le retour sur investissement
n'est pas immédiat.
Ça ne marche pas comme ça.
- Ah ouais ?
- Patience.
Parfois, avec la bureaucratie,
la main gauche ignore
ce que fait la main droite.
Tu sais ce que je vois ?
Je vois une main dans ma poche,
et l’autre main
en train de te serrer les couilles.
Putain de Prez !
J'ai męme pas envie de bosser.
- Sanny, mon pote.
- Bienvenue dans le district ouest.
Cette affaire avec Pryzbylewski ?
Nom de Dieu. C'est vraiment triste.
- Tu te balades en fourgonnette ?
- Tu parles.
- Et le boulot, ça va ?
- Putain, Jimmy, j'adore ce poste.
La meilleure chose que Rawls ait faite,
c'est m'envoyer ici.
Pas de stress, pas de bagarres.
Je bosse huit heures.
Pas de boulot ŕ ramener chez moi.
Je suis aux anges.
Toutes ces années ŕ en chier ŕ la criminelle
et pour quoi ?
La retraite est la męme, l’ulcčre en moins.
Je suis content que ça ait marché pour toi.
<i>- Allô ?
- Tu as appelé mon bureau ?</i>
<i>- Oui, plusieurs fois.
- Vraiment, pourquoi ?</i>
<i>- Ŕ ton avis ?
- Pour coucher avec moi. On dîne d’abord ?</i>
<i>- Ce soir, ça te va ?
- Au Georgia Brown, au bas de la 15e rue.</i>
Ça marche. Tu veux que je réserve ?
<i>- Non, je peux toujours avoir une table.
- Bon.</i>
<i>- On dit 19 h 30 ?
- Ŕ tout ŕ l’heure.</i>
<i>- Salut.
- Salut.</i>
T'as rencard ?
GRAY
La voix du changement
- Qu'en penses-tu ?
- Jolies couleurs.
- Ton cheval de bataille ?
- L’éducation.
- Je pensais ętre le maire de l’éducation.
- Bonne chance, Tony.
- Je suis sincčre.
- Merci.
- Quand annonces-tu ta candidature ?
- Le mois prochain.
Commencer tôt
pour lever le plus de fonds possible.
En fait, j'ai plusieurs personnes ŕ voir
avant cela. Je veux tâter le terrain.
- Quoi, Watkins ?
- On dirait qu'il m'aime bien.
Tu crois vraiment qu'Odell Watkins
va abandonner le maire ?
Tu pourrais le sonder sur un sujet ou deux.
C'est plus subtil comme ça.
Le charmer d'abord.
Parle-lui des problčmes, et petit ŕ petit,
estime s'il est pręt ŕ t'appuyer.
- Ça me plaît. On devrait faire ça.
- On ?
J'avais pensé
qu'on pourrait faire campagne ŕ deux.
Toi, au conseil municipal.
Moi, en haut de l’affiche,
un dirigeant noir en devenir,
bel homme, grand orateur.
Toi, le grand espoir blanc,
la nouvelle voix de la réforme civique.
Royce aurait du fil ŕ retordre.
Pourquoi crois-tu
que je veux ętre président du conseil ?
Que peux-tu viser d'autre ? Réfléchis-y.
Regarde ça.
On dirait des cafards en pleine lumičre.
- Alors ?
- Touché ŕ la tęte et au torse.
- Il y a deux douilles, lŕ-bas.
- Attendez avant d'appeler.
C'en est fini de la théorie
de la non-violence ŕ Hamsterdam.
Herc,
- aide-les ŕ déplacer le corps.
- Quoi ?
En dehors de la zone de non-droit.
Carv, t'as pété un plomb ?
On peut le faire
avant que l’ambulance arrive.
- Pourquoi ?
- Si la criminelle vient ici
et qu'ils vérifient,
cette histoire de zone de non-droit
va s'ébruiter.
- Tant mieux.
- Arręte, Herc.
Pas question. Pas question.
Rien ŕ foutre de tes galons. Rien de rien.
Toke, Gil,
aidez-moi ŕ l’enlever d'Hamsterdam.
Je serai le premier officier sur place.
C'est ma responsabilité.
N'oubliez pas les douilles.
Pensez ŕ m'appeler.
- Oui.
- Prévenez-moi.
- Au revoir.
- Au revoir.
Oui !
7-60 ŕ K.G.A.
<i>Parlez, 7-60.</i>
Retrouvez-moi sur Vincent Street,
en dessous de Fayette.
Bien reçu, sur Vincent, au sud de Fayette.
Tu dis que t'as bossé avec lui ?
Trois tirs sans sommation.
Il a peur des Blacks ou quoi ?
Merde.
- C'est allé trop loin.
- C'est pas ŕ moi qu'il faut le dire.
<i>Il me faudrait le numéro d'un journal,
The Sun.</i>
Le numéro des journalistes.
La salle de rédaction, oui.
- Alors, tu vas rien dire ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ŕ dire ?
- Avon, c'est la famille.
- Je sais.
Quelqu'un a pu nous faire ça, Avon.
- Ŕ notre famille.
- Le flic dit des conneries.
- Pour t'embrouiller.
- Exactement.
Pourquoi ?
Ce flic me connaît pas.
Je suis rien pour lui.
Il sait que tu vas vouloir croire ŕ ça,
au fait que D ne se serait pas suicidé.
J'y crois !
Et s'il avait eu une embrouille ?
Avec un autre prisonnier ?
Le meurtrier voulait pas
que vous le sachiez,
alors il a déguisé ça en suicide.
Personne n'a rien fait.
- Mais le flic a dit...
- Il ment.
Il est payé pour mentir.
Avon, tu es mon frčre.
Je dois savoir ce qui s'est vraiment passé.
D ne nous a pas balancés.
Il a hésité, mais il s'est repris et n'a rien dit.
Et je sais qu'il voulait faire au mieux
pour sa famille.
Pour nous.
Mais je dois savoir que tu sais ça.
Que tu le considérais comme ça.
Quoi ? Tu essaies de dire quoi ?
- Si quelque chose s'est passé...
- Ŕ quoi tu penses, putain ?
Que j'ai été męlé ŕ ça ?
Que je pourrais tuer mon propre neveu ?
C'est ce que tu penses ?
T'as de la merde dans la tęte ou quoi ?
J'ai rien fait ŕ D. J'ai rien ŕ voir avec ça.
Ŕ voir avec quoi ?
- Ŕ voir avec quoi ?
- Avec tout ce qui a pu se passer.
Avec tout ce qui a pu se passer, Brianna.
Vous croyez
que je connais pas mon boulot ? Hein ?
Je comprends.
Je vois que le cadavre a été déplacé.
Il sera lŕ demain matin.
Je vais voir s'il est lŕ.
Je ferai de mon mieux.
Occupez-vous de ça.
Il a dit quoi ?
Lls ont trouvé des traces de sang
le long de la rue.
- Peut-ętre que...
- Comme si on avait traîné le corps.
Ils ont aussi trouvé une troisičme douille.
Merde.
Quel est le topo ?
On arrange tout ça d'ici demain matin
ou il envoie ça ŕ l’I.G.S.
Et au préfet adjoint.
- Je suis baisé !
- Non, c'est moi qui suis baisé !
Vous n'avez pas déplacé
le cadavre, sergent.
Vous n'avez pas déplacé
le cadavre, sergent.
C'est moi qui l’ai fait. Compris ?
Je sais que vous avez fait cela
ŕ cause de ce que j'essaie de faire ici,
mais c'est ma responsabilité.
On fait quoi, alors ?
Il a dit ne pas planifier
de nouvelles dépenses
bien qu'il en ait prévu dans l’agenda
du conseil de coordination de la justice,
pour ce que ça vaut.
Pauvre Clarence. Il commence ŕ fatiguer.
Nous demandons l’aide
de l’assemblée législative.
Si la ville pouvait obtenir 200000 $,
nous pourrions renforcer
la protection des citoyens.
Ce serait mieux
avec le maire de notre côté, mais...
- Pourriez-vous le convaincre ?
- Clarence ?
- Il n'écoute męme plus.
- Je le sais bien.
Je suis conseiller depuis trois ans,
ça fait long quand on est ignoré.
Les rčgles n'ont pas été respectées.
Mes hommes ont tenu leurs promesses,
ils ont tenu parole et n'ont rien fait.
Vous n'avez pas respecté
votre part du marché.
C'était pas ma bande.
Je fais pas ce genre de distinctions.
Quelqu'un a amené un flingue
dans la zone de non-droit et l’a utilisé.
Vous n'avez pas tenu parole.
Je peux pas justifier cette zone
s'il y a des cadavres.
Ce que j'essaie de dire, c'est que si demain
je n'ai pas le coupable,
toute cette histoire de zone de non-droit
ŕ Hamsterdam est terminée.
Les flics vont retourner dans les rues
et vous allez en chier.
Vous m'entendez ?
Vous en avez bien profité.
Vous vous ętes fait un max de blé,
pas de cautions ŕ payer.
Et partout, les rues étaient tranquilles.
Mais tout ça sera terminé demain,
ŕ moins que vous m'ameniez le coupable.
Vous pensez que ça va marcher ?
Et vous ?
C'est vraiment bon.
- Comment tu as connu cet endroit ?
- Clinton y venait pendant son mandat.
Ici et au Red Sage. Le nouveau Président,
c'est plutôt le genre steaks.
Alors tu vis ici, et tu passes
beaucoup de temps ŕ Baltimore ?
Je bosse lŕ-bas.
Pour l’association des anciens élčves
de St. Mary's.
J'étais ŕ la fac de droit du Maryland,
j'y ai des amis.
- J'ai grandi ŕ Homeland.
- Vraiment ?
Moi, ŕ Lauraville.
- Tu es allé ŕ quelle fac ?
- Ŕ Loyola. Seulement un an.
Ma copine est tombée enceinte, alors...
- Alors ?
- Alors...
Alors tu es devenu flic ŕ Baltimore.
- Ça te convient ?
- C'est plutôt bien.
Je travaille sur de grosses affaires
de drogue. Sur des écoutes.
Sur de longues enquętes
concernant des délinquants violents.
En fait, peu de flics
sont capables de faire ça.
Il faut un certain...
Je sais pas, il faut aimer ça.
L’excitation de la poursuite, tout ça.
- Tu fais quoi en politique ?
- Des campagnes électorales.
- Tu es directrice de campagne ?
- Plutôt un stratčge.
Je m'occupe pas du train-train,
mais de la stratégie
qui fera gagner un candidat.
Consultante, en quelque sorte.
- Tu travailles pour quelqu'un ŕ Baltimore ?
- J'ai pas le droit de le dire.
Il n'a encore rien annoncé pour l’instant.
Il est bien ?
Si tu bosses pour lui, il aura ma voix.
Je peux faire ça.
T'as voté pour qui ?
Quoi ? Tu parles de Bush et de l’autre ?
Kerry.
Tu n'as pas voté ?
J'y ai réfléchi et je me suis dit
que Bush était ŕ côté de la plaque, je sais,
mais il n'avait aucune chance
dans le Maryland.
Et puis ces types,
c'est blanc bonnet et bonnet blanc.
Ils sont déconnectés de la réalité.
Ils savent pas ce qui se passe sur le terrain,
leur seule chance
d'aller dans le quartier ouest,
c'est que l’avion présidentiel
s'écrase sur Monroe Street
en rentrant ŕ l’aéroport.
Ils sont déconnectés.
Enfin, d'aprčs ce que je vois.
Enfin, c'est seulement mon avis.
Colvin dit qu'il veut le coupable en prison
oů c'en est fini
de la zone de non-droit demain.
La fin d'Hamsterdam.
- Colvin.
- Du district ouest.
- Sham, qui a fait ça ?
- Un gamin du gang de Tuckie.
Il connaît du monde ? Il a de la famille ?
Non, il est lŕ que depuis deux mois.
Pourquoi il a tiré ?
Un connard du gang Ghost Kane
s'est moqué de ses pompes.
Vas-y.
Je reviens tout de suite.
Non, il doit envoyer ça
par le courrier interne.
Oui.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
- Je viens me constituer prisonnier.
- Tu as fait quoi ?
- J'ai buté un mec.
- Ah ouais ?
Il faut un autre sac.
- T'es où, Mike ?
- Par ici.
Un règlement de comptes ?
Barksdale se venge
sur mon ami Marlo, hein ?
Merde.
Message reçu.
Dis, on est où ?
Nous sommes à Baltimore, Lamar.
Baltimore, dans le Maryland.
C'est la deuxième planque
que ces enfoirés me vident cette semaine.
Quand on dérange un nid de frelons,
on risque de se faire piquer.
- Tout le monde vire parano.
- Bien obligé.
Ils ont eu Latroy.
Putain, vous branlez quoi dans la rue ?
Vous savez pas que c'est la guerre ?
Grimpez dans la caisse.
Où sont passées les tours ?
Le train est en marche.
Celui de la réforme, Lamar.
Celui de la réforme.
INSPECTEUR
POLICE DE BALTIMORE
SUR ÉCOUTE
POLICE DE BALTIMORE
SERVICE STATISTIQUES
ÉTAT DU MARYLAND
MISE SUR ÉCOUTE AUTORISÉE
BALTIMORE CAPITALE DU CRIME
"Appelle ça une crise de leadership."
Proposition Joe
Ce truc devrait marcher,
on devrait entendre des voix.
Il nous faut le vrai numéro de téléphone
de Bodie.
On a des présomptions suffisantes
avec ces jetables.
Chaque appel chopé
par ces putains de capteurs
pue le trafic de drogue.
C'est pas moi qui décide.
Pearlman tient à établir un lien solide
avec un trafiquant notoire.
Ces gars-là changent
de portable toutes les semaines.
Quand on obtient une écoute,
c'est pas pour longtemps.
Et cette rotation ne représente pas
pour le fournisseur de téléphonie
une "situation urgente", hein ?
Quelle est la position de votre patron ?
Demper ? Il se préoccupe surtout
de sa réélection l’année prochaine.
Et les fédéraux ?
D'après eux, ils ne peuvent rien pour nous.
Vu leur interprétation
de la loi sur les communications,
ils sont sincères.
<i>Le Patriot Act pour la sécurité nationale.</i>
Ils se fichent du reste.
Or, les sociétés nous tiennent
par les couilles.
Veuillez m'excuser, Votre Honneur.
Bon, écoutez.
Voilà tout ce que je peux faire pour vous.
Faites-moi un affidavit en bonne
et due forme avec extrait du procès-verbal.
Quand vous relèverez de nouveaux
numéros de jetables, appelez-moi,
n'importe quand,
pour mettre ces numéros sur écoute.
C'est bien.
Mais on écoutera quand même
des téléphones
- dont ils se débarrassent.
- C'est probable.
- C'est complètement...
- Débile.
Le juge Phelan t'a à la bonne.
Ça dure depuis quand ?
Depuis mon tout premier procès
dans son tribunal, je crois.
Pas étonnant
que tes requêtes passent toujours.
- Vous vouliez me voir, monsieur ?
- Assieds-toi.
Merci pour la loyauté dont tu as fait preuve
en déplaçant ce corps.
Ça manquait de jugeote, mais je t'en suis
tout de même reconnaissant.
Tu es quelqu'un de bien, sergent.
Ton instinct est sûr
et, pour autant que je sache,
tu es un bon supérieur.
Mais il semble
que tu ne vaux rien comme flic.
Ne le prends pas mal.
Tu es comme tous nos jeunes policiers,
comme toute ta génération.
Réfléchis-y.
Tu es avec nous
depuis plus d'un an, Carver.
Tu n'as noué aucun contact,
personne ne te donne de tuyaux.
Est-ce que j'ai tort ?
C'est gênant.
Je ne pense pas
que j'aurais jamais mis le doigt dessus,
mais Dozerman s'est fait tirer dessus
pour une connerie.
Là, ça a dépassé les bornes pour moi.
J'ai alors eu l’idée
de cette zone de non-droit, Hamsterdam,
parce que ces histoires de drogue,
c'est pas un boulot pour un flic.
Non, pas du tout.
Envoyer un type avec un badge et une arme
dans la rue
alpaguer quelques dealers, ça oui.
Mais faire la police ?
Dès qu'on parle de guerre,
les gars se comportent en guerriers.
Ils partent tous en croisade,
ratissent les rues, bouclent à tout va,
font un carnage.
Dans une guerre, il faut un ennemi.
Et d'un coup, tout le monde
dans la rue devient un putain d'ennemi.
Et le quartier
où on était censé faire la police
est devenu un territoire occupé.
Tu me suis ?
Je crois.
Écoute, voilà ce que je veux dire.
Être soldat et être policier
sont deux choses différentes.
Avant de faire le mauvais choix
et de déclencher ces guéguerres,
un flic doit aller sur le terrain
pour mieux le connaître.
Et si des choses se passent sur ce terrain,
qu'il s'agisse d'un viol,
d'un vol ou d'une fusillade,
il doit avoir des contacts
qui le tiennent au courant.
Mais quand je te demande à toi,
le sergent des narcos,
de me renseigner
sur ce qui se passe dans les rues,
j'obtiens que des foutaises.
Tu parles de chiffres et d'arrestations.
Mais putain, ça n'a rien à voir
avec la protection du quartier, si ?
Le pire, avec cette soi-disant
"guerre de la drogue",
à mon avis...
c'est que... Elle fout le métier en l’air.
Major.
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
- Un visiteur.
<i>Un journaliste du Sun.
Il a visité les zones de non-droit, les trois.</i>
On se retrouve à la voiture.
J'ai pensé qu'on pourrait réécrire l’affidavit,
ajouter les infos qu'on a eues
avec les capteurs
et remettre le dossier au juge.
T'as fait ton droit ?
Si oui, tu pourrais décider de faire ça.
Qui voudrait se faire passer
pour un avocat ?
Je dis juste qu'on est trop timides.
On va jouer le jeu de Phelan.
Trop insister pourrait nuire
à nos futures requêtes.
On a hérité de Phelan sur cette écoute ?
Ce nullard hypocrite m'a planté
la dernière fois.
Détends-toi. Il ne se représente pas.
Il sera parfait.
Tu parles, cette sous-merde.
Si on vous gêne, on est des sous-merdes.
Ça fait partie du jeu.
C'est noté.
Alors il y a ces entrepôts,
les anciennes résidences Winchester
et le quartier fantôme de Vincent Street ?
Trois zones.
Et ils ont l’intention de rien faire ?
Colvin nous a dit
d'y envoyer les revendeurs
pour procéder après aux arrestations.
Mais il y a eu aucune arrestation.
Et le central est au courant ?
À mon avis, ils se doutent de que dalle.
Mais j'aimerais voir leur tête
quand vous en parlerez.
C'est absolument...
M'en parlez pas.
- Vous avez fait du beau boulot.
- Ouais.
Vous n'avez plus
qu'à recruter quelques mômes.
Arrêtez.
Vous dites ça comme si c'était facile
mais, franchement,
je sais pas comment aborder ces gamins.
Ne vous en faites pas pour ça.
Vous n'êtes vraiment pas le seul.
On en tient un.
Grand-mère de Bodie
Sa grand-mère.
<i>- Tu me cherches ?
- Mon garçon,</i>
<i>faut pas laisser tes vêtements
dans la machine.</i>
<i>Enfin, combien de fois je dois te le dire ?</i>
<i>Ouais, Mee-Maw. Pardon.
J’ai oublié, ça va ?</i>
<i>Mais j’ai récupéré la lessive. Je l’ai.</i>
De la lessive, c'est sûrement un code.
Écoute cet enregistrement
de Bodie Broadus,
dans une cabine
qu'on écoutait il y a un moment.
ARCHIVE "BODIE" BROADUS 2002
<i>Je vous jure, j’ai vu le type.
Il dit qu’il l’a pas.</i>
- C'est la même voix, sûr.
- J'informe le juge.
Parlez de la comparaison dans le rapport.
C'est parti.
Ouais.
J'en ai, par ici. Allez.
<i>- Major Colvin, district ouest.
- Banisky, du Sun.</i>
Alors, c'est votre idée ?
Deux pour un.
On peut marcher un peu ?
Apocalypse. Apocalypse.
J'ai de l’Apocalypse.
Par ici, petit.
Vous laissez des dealers vendre peinards
à des camés qui se piquent en pleine rue,
à côté de bénévoles
qui distribuent des seringues.
Enfin, qui est au courant au central ?
Le commandement est parfaitement
au courant.
Bien sûr, ils étaient un peu inquiets...
Mais les dossiers qui vont en sortir...
- Les dossiers ?
- Bien sûr, des poursuites.
Vos agents disent
qu'il n'y a eu aucune arrestation.
Mes hommes sont chargés uniquement
de déplacer la vente
vers les zones prévues.
Ils ignorent tout des enquêtes en cours.
Y a plus personne à la crim.
C'est vrai ?
Qui est l’inspecteur responsable ?
Écoutez.
J'en ai déjà trop dit.
En gros,
si vous commencez à faire votre enquête,
ils vont chier dans leur froc
en croyant à une fuite.
Ils vont se mêler du dossier et on perdra
tous les efforts investis ici.
Vous dites
que c'est une stratégie policière ?
Et c'est quoi, à votre avis ?
Vous croyez
qu'on laisserait faire ça, sinon ?
Voyons, Banisky.
Regardez un peu ce bordel.
Si un autre journaliste a vent de ça...
Je vous dis tout et vous publiez illico.
Tout à fait.
Une semaine.
Mais je publie tout ce que je sais.
- Purple Haze. Purple Haze.
- Entendu.
Par ici.
Alors, mec, pourquoi t'es revenu ?
J'aime pas laisser un boulot inachevé.
On dit que t'as été descendu
avant même de le commencer.
Pas ton genre, d'être surpris.
Trahi, plutôt.
Je cherche l’homme qu'ils ont envoyé.
Il a un accent du coin, de la rue.
L’air doué, brillant, vingt ou trente ans,
la peau foncée
et une cicatrice sur le visage, comme ça.
- Tu connais ce type ?
- Je le connais.
Pas personnellement,
mais tous ceux qui sont dans le métier
le connaissent.
- Il est avec Barksdale ?
- Il est tout seul.
Parfois flanqué d'un ou deux gamins.
Les primaires sont dans dix mois,
tu devrais penser à l’argent.
Je sais. Faire sortir le fric.
Tu t'y mets maintenant,
tu t'arrêtes quand t'as fait le plein.
Il faut un million rien que pour la télé.
Tu crois vraiment qu'on peut y arriver ?
Les chances sont minces, mais, oui.
Je crois qu'on peut,
si on évite tout un tas de pépins.
Même si c'est un Blanc ?
Même si c'est un Blanc.
Ça me fait penser
qu'on est plutôt assortis ici.
On va avoir besoin de visages noirs,
ceux de gens haut placés.
Vous avez raison.
On doit songer à obtenir l’appui
de dirigeants noirs.
Des prêtres, des intervenants sociaux,
des élus.
Ce sera le plus dur.
Il faut une partie du vote noir
si on veut la majorité.
Tony Gray doit se présenter.
Il doit être candidat,
et il doit avoir ses chances.
Ce type pèse pas très lourd, si ?
- C'est un type bien.
- Parfait.
C'est un type bien, mais on veut
qu'il prenne des votes à Royce.
J'en sais rien. Cette histoire avec Tony...
Ça n'a rien de personnel, Tommy.
C'est de la politique.
Faut t'y faire, ou tu perdras.
<i>Ouais. Ce gars au nez pointu,
il va, tu sais...</i>
<i>- Il va à l’Apollo.
- L’Apollo ?</i>
<i>Ouais. Il lui faut deux billets.</i>
<i>Merde. Tweety Bird est sur le coup.</i>
<i>Putain, je vous l’ai déjà dit,
je veux pas de noms.</i>
<i>- Ouais, c’est vrai. Alors, je t’appelle ?
- Ouais. D’accord.</i>
- Apollo, comme le théâtre ?
- Comme la 125e Rue.
125 grammes, un huitième de kilo.
Deux billets, c'est "deux fois’.
- Un seul code nouveau, Hamsterdam.
- Hamsterdam ?
On suppose que c'est lié
à la planque de drogue.
Bon, je vais rejoindre Kima,
on va suivre Tweety Bird.
Content des résultats ?
Encore une semaine comme ça
et on aura tout leur réseau
et bien plus de numéros à surveiller.
J'aimerais parler aux inspecteurs.
Bien sûr.
L’I.G.S. A Prez à l’œil. Faut s'y préparer.
l’élément racial est suffisant
pour les faire réagir.
Ce garçon n'a pas de chance, hein ?
Pour le rapport hiérarchique,
j'ai besoin que vous me disiez
si à votre avis
Prez avait des préjugés raciaux.
Il avait des idées à la con, c'est sûr,
mais j'ai jamais senti de racisme.
Lieutenant, vous êtes sérieux ?
Franchement, tu crois que Waggoner
serait mort s'il avait été blanc ?
- On cherchait un homme noir, c'est tout.
- Je disais ça comme ça.
Le Seigneur a réservé le dimanche matin
pour la messe.
Même quand Kenny Bird
et Peanut se battaient,
ils avaient le bon sens
de respecter cette trêve.
Tu sais que ceux
de Barksdale ont envoyé un chapeau ?
En signe de respect ?
Il ont sonné à la porte
et l’ont laissé sur le perron.
Ils ont la honte.
Mlle Joséphine va mieux ?
Toujours quelques bleus, mais ça va.
Mais pas toi.
Pas tant que j'ai pas réglé cette histoire.
Butch, je veux que tu ailles à ma banque
et que tu racontes
qu'Omar filera du fric pour les choper,
tu me suis ?
Garde ton fric.
- Allez, Butchie, je dois le faire.
- T'auras pas à payer.
Chez Thomkins, en haut de McCulloh.
Le funérarium ?
Attends, tu savais où étaient ces bâtards
- et t'as pas ouvert ta gueule ?
- Figure-toi que je te cherchais.
La vérité, c'est que tes chances
de t'en prendre à ce gang
et de t'en sortir vivant sont minces
comme du papier.
Je peux plus reculer, Butch.
C'est quoi ça ? Où sont mes gars ?
C'est Slim Charles.
Il a recruté des gros bras.
Slim Charles ? Putain, depuis quand...
Les chiffres sont bons ?
En baisse pour la troisième semaine
de suite.
Et notre stock de came
va pas durer longtemps, String.
Je sais.
Slim a dit qu'ils étaient là pour te protéger.
- À moi. À moi.
- Beau lancer.
Sors de là. Dégage-toi.
Vas-y, dribble.
Amateur de merde.
Hé, on se calme.
Vous êtes tous sur mon gars.
Vous faites tous faute sur lui.
Chouette style.
Pas faciles à occuper, hein ?
Qu'est-ce que t'attends, là ?
Tu dis ça pour le plaisir de m'emmerder
ou tu envisages de faire quelque chose
pour y remédier ?
Je vais tenter le coup.
Je cherche des gamins intéressés
par la boxe.
La boxe ?
Tiens. C'est mon banc.
J'y laisse croupir les enfants
qui savent pas jouer calmement.
Écoutez bien.
Ce monsieur lance un programme de boxe.
Je vous regarde et je me dis
que vous devriez vous inscrire.
C'est pour toi, ça.
Ses mains, il s'en sert que pour se branler.
Ta gueule, connard ! Va te faire foutre !
Amène-toi, enculé, t'es qu'une merde.
Du calme. Assieds-toi. Assis.
Allez, doucement. Assieds-toi.
Toi, tu baisses trop ta garde.
Si ce gamin savait boxer, il te démolirait.
Ouais, c'est plutôt lui qui se ferait démolir.
Lève-toi, je vais te montrer un truc.
Allons. Je vais pas te faire mal.
Des capsules jaunes, qui en veut ?
Des capsules jaunes.
T'as vu ?
Bon, assieds-toi.
Si vous voulez en savoir plus,
mon gymnase est sur Gilmor,
dans l’ancienne usine de pneus.
Vous êtes tous bienvenus. D'accord ?
J'ai vu Tweety Bird se garer là.
On n'a plus qu'à attendre le ravitaillement.
J'espère que ces cons vont pas
nous faire poireauter toute la journée.
Quoi, ça te dérange ?
Non, tout va bien.
Ouais, ça se voit.
Tu te souviens de cette femme
dont je t'ai parlé ?
Qui fait de la politique ? Comment ça va ?
Ça va pas. Ça a merdé.
J'ai l’impression d'être bien nulle part.
Parce que t'es flic ?
Non, pas seulement.
Un jour, je vais la voir.
Dans sa chambre d'hôtel, au dernier étage.
J'appuie sur le bouton de l’étage.
L’ascenseur bouge pas,
parce qu'il faut une putain de clé spéciale
pour avoir le droit
d'aller à ce putain d'étage.
Je vais à la réception,
où un connard téléphone à sa chambre
avant de m'autoriser à aller la baiser.
Elle me parle de choses
que je comprends pas,
je me sens comme une merde.
Elle me fait sentir qu'un type un peu malin
ferait autre chose de sa vie.
Comme faire du fric ou de la politique.
Je me sens comme une bite sur pattes.
Sérieusement.
Je suis le plus malin de ce coin de la ville
mais pour elle, je suis qu'une queue
qui mène une vie stupide
à faire des trucs stupides.
Elle me regarde même pas, merde.
Reste dans la voiture.
Le grand m'a dit de te suivre...
Le grand va venir t'aider
quand je vais te faire sauter la cervelle ?
Reste dans la voiture.
Bon, sois bref. J'ai un rendez-vous !
On s'en fout de ton rendez-vous !
T'es plus dur à trouver
que le point G de ma femme, mec.
Ouais, toi et les frimeurs de Barksdale
pouvez rester sur votre cul.
Mais d'autres veulent gagner leur vie.
Ce bordel fout nos affaires en l’air aussi.
Avon est donc prêt à discuter calmement
avec Marlo pour résoudre ce bordel ?
Parce que sinon, String,
j'ai de mauvaises nouvelles pour toi.
Les gars et moi, on s'est réunis.
On a voté dans les règles et décidé
de te mettre hors circuit
si tu laisses pas tomber cette guerre.
Et hors circuit, ça veut dire plus de came.
Les gars veulent pas t'en filer
si toi et tes gars continuez
à les massacrer dans la rue.
Et le gamin ? Il en dit quoi ?
Vinson dit que Marlo est prêt à discuter
s'il garde ses points de vente.
Écoute-moi bien, String,
on n'est pas des ingrats.
On sait tous ce que t'as fait
pour la coopérative.
Mais voilà la situation.
Tu ne peux pas continuer à la présider
si tu tiens pas tes hommes.
Appelle ça une crise de leadership.
COMMANDANT DU DISTRICT
Vous allez leur dire ?
Il le faut.
Un intervenant social, ce journaliste
ou un de mes hommes que ça défrise
va lâcher le morceau un jour.
Si c'est pas maintenant, c'est demain.
On pourrait procéder
à quelques arrestations tactiques.
Non. Vous savez ce qui arrivera
si on arrête ceux d'Hamsterdam ?
Tout le reste du district redevient un enfer.
Non. Si Rawls doit me faire ma fête,
autant saisir l’occasion
de défendre ma version.
Devonne.
Qu'est-ce que c'était ?
Il le fallait.
Quelqu'un s'est fait tuer !
Pourquoi je devrais balancer
celui qui nous a donné Denali ?
On n'a pas eu Marlo, mais quand même...
Non, il a été réglo. C'est fini.
Avon, faut que je te parle.
Je te recontacte. Vire-moi ces mecs.
Vise ça, String.
Ce truc tue tout ce qui bouge
à 50 m à la ronde.
Slim a piqué ça à un soldat
qui revenait de je sais pas où.
Tu sais, j'ai parlé aux gars de Prop Joe.
- D'après eux, ça peut s'arranger.
- Quoi, négocier ?
C'est le moment, mec.
Tu as défendu ton point de vue.
T'es célèbre
maintenant que t'as rabaissé le caquet
de Marlo.
Pourquoi ne pas partir gagnant ?
Je veux être sûr de piger, là.
Donc, on reprend comme avant.
On va être hors circuit, Avon !
Prop Joe et ses potes, ils ont voté.
Ils vont nous éjecter.
On n'aura plus de came,
on perd de toute façon,
parce qu'on vendra rien
dans ces putains de rues.
Avon, regarde-toi.
T'es camé jusqu'aux yeux
sans même avoir à te piquer,
c'est le pouvoir qui te fait planer,
tu joues au petit soldat.
Tu dois te reprendre, penser aux affaires.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux, merde ?
L’enculé. Il est fort.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Écoute, Avon, tu dois songer
à ce que nous rapporte ce truc.
Du prestige ?
Le fait que nos noms circulent
dans le ghetto des dealers ?
Non, mon pote,
il y a plus important que ça.
Avon, écoute, on est frères, toi et moi.
On n'a jamais cru qu'on irait si loin,
mais merde, on est là
maintenant, le monde est à nous.
Le monde entier, mon pote,
pas juste quelques rues.
Le monde entier, B.
Tu sais ce que Slim vient de me dire ?
Devonne est morte.
On lui a tiré une balle dans la bouche
et une dans chaque sein.
Tu veux encore une trêve, String ?
T'as raison,
j'ai besoin d'apprendre la discipline.
Mais entrer là-dedans ?
Tu serais mieux placé.
Tu es l’appât idéal, Lamar.
Ils penseront que tu es déchiré.
Tu es tellement homophobe !
Tu vois ?
Je suis même pas encore entré
et tu me traites déjà d'enculé.
Vous savez où vous êtes ?
Je cherche un certain Omar.
Je sais pas son nom.
Il a une cicatrice, je crois.
Un balafré qui s'appelle Omar ?
Original, mais je peux rien pour vous.
Vous buvez quoi ?
Tu devrais attendre encore quatre ans.
Non. Je dois le faire maintenant.
Il faut trois candidats,
et Tony se présente cette année.
C'est juste que...
Tony est mon plus vieil ami au conseil.
Tu pourrais aller lui en parler ?
Jouer cartes sur table ?
Le genre "Que le meilleur gagne" ?
À vrai dire,
il n'a aucune chance seul contre Royce,
non plus.
Il n'a guère que des autocollants.
Il veut se concentrer sur l’éducation.
Enfin,
ça mène à quoi, comme thème ?
Si je suis à égalité avec Tony
et qu'il se retire, je ne peux pas gagner.
J'ai besoin qu'il reste dans la course.
Je me sens minable. Vraiment.
Ça a pas de gueule.
- C'est nul, ici.
- Putain, ouais.
- C'est de la merde.
- Tu l’as dit.
Bon, y a des casiers, du matos.
- Tout est pourri, ici.
- Dégage.
Hé, ici, passe-la-moi.
- Hé, tu salopes mes fringues.
- Oublie ton jean.
- Va te faire foutre.
- Connard.
On a suivi Tweety Bird toute la nuit
jusqu'à ce qui peut être une planque,
puis jusque chez lui à Woodlawn.
On a des photos, sa plaque...
ÉCOUTE INACTIVE - MODE VEILLE
- Que s'est-il passé ?
- Ils ont jeté leurs téléphones.
Les enregistreurs et les écoutes
se sont arrêtés vers 15 h.
On a capté à peine 30 heures.
Je croyais qu'un jetable,
ça durait plusieurs semaines ?
Plus maintenant. Une semaine, max.
On a dépensé plus de 9000 $
pour 18 interceptions
dont cinq inutiles.
Ça fait près de 700 $ l’appel.
D'ici qu'on en sache plus,
si on se remettait
sur Bernard et sa copine ?
Au moins écouter
leurs nouveaux téléphones.
Ça ne nous donnera encore que 30 heures.
On doit bien pouvoir les prendre
de vitesse ?
Si on pouvait mettre par avance
des jetables sur écoute...
Et puis ?
On les fait mettre en vente
et on attend que Bernard se pointe ?
Le problème vient des sociétés
de téléphonie.
Ils veulent au minimum quatre jours
pour traiter une réquisition
et encore, sous la menace
d'une dénonciation aux médias.
Quatre jours pour appuyer
sur quelques touches. Tu parles.
Et si...
Laissez tomber.
Je sais ce que tu veux dire,
je viens de penser au même truc.
Bon, écoute. Quand je te le dis,
tu avances le pied gauche.
- Hé, il tripote le pied de mon pote.
- Ouais, il me sent le cul, aussi.
Arrête tes clowneries, mec.
Tu crois que tu vas apprendre quoi,
en faisant le con ?
Ouais. Pas étonnant
que tu en prennes plein la gueule.
Putain, le laisse pas te parler comme ça.
Je l’ai vu traîner dans le coin
et gober des pilules.
Ouais, et vendre son cul, aussi.
- Écoute, fils de pute.
- Vas-y, enfoiré, frappe-moi.
Frappe un mineur, tu verras ce que ça fait.
On se tire. Connard d'enculé.
Pédale.
- Pauvre minable.
- Taré.
Lester.
Il fumait pas, avant.
Sale habitude.
Et regarde un peu cette allure.
Lourde responsabilité que le pouvoir.
<i>Annuaire Bay Wireless.
Quelle est la ville de la recherche ?</i>
Baltimore, dans le Maryland.
<i>- Quel numéro cherchez-vous ?
- La police de Baltimore.</i>
<i>- Un service en particulier ?
- Celui de Baltimore ouest.</i>
<i>- C’est pour une urgence ?
- Non. Pas d'urgence.</i>
Ouais, ils cherchaient à te foutre en rogne.
Ils font souvent ça.
Ils savent très bien énerver un gars.
T'as qu'à te souvenir
que ce sont que des gosses.
Si je te racontais, tu me croirais pas.
Ils étaient vachement arrogants.
Ils écoutaient rien.
André, je veux que tu le colles.
- Oui, monsieur, je le colle.
- Bien.
Reprise !
Essaie quand même de t'en souvenir.
Quand ces deux-là sont entrés ici,
ils étaient vachement arrogants.
Maintenant ils viennent tous les jours.
"Oui, monsieur. Non, monsieur."
Encore mal dégrossis, mais avec de l’aide,
ils s'en sortiront.
Comment tu fais ?
Quoi qu'ils fassent,
je ne les laisserai pas échouer.
Quand tu fais ça, ça les déstabilise.
Ils arrêtent vite leurs singeries.
Que penses-tu de lui ?
Plutôt mauvais.
Il est pas mauvais. Il commence.
Non, je me souviens pas de son nom.
Mais je l’ai vu dans le coin.
Il est du quartier ouest.
Il est pas dealer,
ou alors il fait ça discrètement.
Tu pourrais pas lui parler, le piéger ?
J'en sais rien, Kima. Il risque de mal réagir.
Et elle ?
C'est Little Squeak, de Lanvale.
Elle était dans le gang de Turtle Well.
Elle a perdu du poids.
Elle est mieux que dans mon souvenir.
Et j'ai de sacrés souvenirs de cette fille.
La vache, Bubs, y a qui
dans le quartier ouest que tu connais pas ?
Les honnêtes citoyens.
Mon indic connaît la fille.
- Il saurait la piéger ?
- Il sera parfait.
Regarde ça.
C'est le district ouest.
- Attends, Stringer appelle le district ?
- Peut-être qu'il veut se rendre.
Après le boulot qu'on a abattu,
je lui pardonnerais pas ça.
Baisse-toi. Baisse-toi et esquive.
Bravo ! Suis le mouvement des mains !
Quoi ? Mes gars sont pas venus ?
Si, mais ils sont repartis.
Par ici !
Tu veux un rabais, le vieux ?
Non, c'est toi que je veux.
Quoi, on t'a volé un truc ?
Je suis passé m'excuser.
Je démarre, comme entraîneur,
et on est partis du mauvais pied.
Je veux pas que ça en reste là,
je veux pas vous laisser tomber.
Ce bâtard a pas de mémoire.
C'est nous qui sommes partis.
Bref, maintenant je suis là.
Résumons.
Vous voulez vendre aux trafiquants
des téléphones mobiles
dont la mise sur écoute a été approuvée
à l’avance.
Et vous voulez que je signe
ces réquisitions du tribunal
portant sur des téléphones qui,
au moment où je fais ça,
n'ont été utilisés pour aucune activité
illégale d'aucune sorte.
Ne cherchez pas, Votre Honneur,
il n'y a pas de précédent.
Cause probable circonstancielle, au mieux.
Et puis tant pis, essayons.
On laissera la cour d'appel en juger,
si on se rend jusque-là.
La sagesse du droit.
Je vous offre un verre ?
- Putain, tu te prends pour qui ?
- Pardon.
Tignasse.
Il a appelé. Vous êtes là tard.
On prépare la réunion
du service statistiques.
Du nouveau, major ?
Ton unité travaille toujours
sur une guerre de la drogue, non ?
Avec acharnement.
Est-ce que le nom
d'Avon Barksdale t'est familier ?
- C'est un trafiquant.
- C'est un chef.
On le croyait calmé,
mais il a refait surface en septembre.
Il est pour beaucoup
dans cette explosion de violence.
Il aurait pu se prendre une balle ?
Il s'est pris une balle ?
Dans quelles circonstances ? Je peux voir.
Non, ça ne servirait à rien.
Il s'est pointé dans aucun hôpital
à ma connaissance.
Major, je vais être franc.
Nous mettons ces gars-là sur écoute.
Mais on fait du sur place.
On n'a pas encore mis la main sur lui.
Il paraît qu'il loge à cette adresse.
Vérifie et fais-moi un rapport fissa.
Ça vient d'un indic, c'est ça ?
Vous voulez voir si votre homme est fiable.
N'essaie pas de me piéger. Je n'ai pas dit
que c'était un homme. Ni une femme.
D'accord. Je demande une surveillance
tout de suite.
D'après mes sources,
l’appart est à son nom.
Sans déconner.
Fais confirmer tout ça
et rappelle-moi sur mon portable.
- Dès demain, si je peux.
- C'est ça.
L’État débloque des fonds
pour réhabiliter l’ouest
Neuf promoteurs bénéficient de ce soutien
Sham.
Shamrock.
Va porter ça à Levy.
Dis-lui que je veux une analyse.
Une analyse ?
Un avis extérieur. Je l’appellerai demain.
D'accord.
Allez, M. Garde du corps.
Comme ça, on pourra la choper.
Alors, c'est moi
qui vais vendre ces téléphones ?
Je récolte l’argent, Bubs.
Tout l’argent ?
- C'est pas Beadie Russell ?
- Si, on dirait.
Hé, elle a pas le droit de tourner !
Cette chère Béatrice Russell.
Je voulais juste dire bonjour.
North et Pulaski.
Cette photo a été prise à 16 h,
l’heure de pointe pour un dealer de rue.
Là, c'est Riggs et Calhoun.
Mount et Fayette.
Edmonson et Brice.
Où vous avez joué au foot, M. l’adjoint.
Je sais où c'est, major.
Ce que j'ignore
et que je meurs d'envie de savoir,
c'est où sont les trafiquants
de Baltimore ouest.
J'espère que ce ne sont pas
des photos truquées.
Non, monsieur, elles sont authentiques.
M. l’adjoint,
j'ai adopté une nouvelle approche.
- Je les ai éloignés des rues.
- Bon sang !
Ne vous foutez pas de moi, major.
Ça, je le vois bien.
Dites-moi comment vous avez fait
pour les éloigner
et où ils traînent maintenant.
M. l’adjoint,
je ne sais pas comment vous l’annoncer,
mais nous...
Enfin, je...
J'ai d'abord cherché dans quelles zones
de mon secteur
le trafic de drogue aurait le moins d'impact.
Ensuite, j'ai forcé tous les dealers de rue
à déménager dans ces zones.
Au début,
je me suis adressé aux petits dealers,
ça n'a rien donné.
Mais finalement,
j'ai rassemblé tous les superviseurs
de mon secteur
et je leur ai fait une offre.
- J'ai réussi à...
- Vous leur avez fait une offre ?
Oui, monsieur.
Soit ils déplaçaient leurs gars
vers une des trois zones désignées
dans lesquelles la lutte contre la drogue
n'était pas la priorité,
soit ils encouraient la colère
de mes hommes les plus teigneux.
Major, j'ai peur de ne pas comprendre.
On ne peut contrôler une rue
qu'en y postant des agents.
Votre présentation ne fait état
d'aucun déploiement de ce genre.
Comment avez-vous...
Soyez pas con,
vous voyez pas ce qu'il a fait ?
Il a légalisé la drogue !
En réalité, j'ai choisi de l’ignorer.
Vous avez perdu la boule.
Il a perdu la boule.
Je veux vous voir dans mon bureau.
Tout de suite !
Bien.
Merci, messieurs.
- Elle démarre.
- Vas-y, Bubs.
Oh, merde.
- Mais, c'est Squeak.
- Ce vieux Bubbles.
T'étais où, ma vieille ? Ça fait un bail.
C'est des t-shirts ?
<i>- Tu fais du fric avec des t-shirts ?
- Parle pas de ce que tu connais pas.</i>
<i>Comment ça va ?
On dit que t’étais en taule.</i>
<i>En liberté conditionnelle depuis un an.
Je fais mes affaires.</i>
<i>- Je vois ça. T’as l’air en forme...
- Il s'en sort ?</i>
<i>- Il est très convaincant.
- Bon, Bubs, faut que j’y aille.</i>
On se voit plus tard.
Hé, Squeak ! J'allais oublier.
Je les vends vraiment pas cher,
ça peut toujours servir.
Je suis foutu.
On est tous foutus.
Cette affaire va tous nous faire sauter.
Seigneur.
J'assume entièrement ce que j'ai fait.
Je veux dire que mes hommes
n'ont rien à y voir.
Ils pensaient
qu'ils montaient un piège complexe.
Si vous me demandez
d'en porter seul la responsabilité, ça me va.
Ça vous va ?
J'ai des congés à solder
et ça va faire 30 ans que je suis là.
Si vous voulez me faire tomber,
je suis prêt.
Mais je ne veux pas entendre
que vous avez sanctionné mes hommes.
Parce que je pourrais m'énerver
et mentir comme un arracheur de dents,
s'il le faut.
Vous me menacez ?
Je crois bien, monsieur.
Sauf votre respect.
Bunny, enfoiré,
je reconnais que c'était brillant !
Dingue et illégal,
mais putain de brillant, ça oui.
Je botte le cul à tout le monde
pour faire baisser les statistiques,
lui se pointe et direct,
Dommage que ça mette fin à nos carrières,
mais enfin...
Vous avez sûrement hâte
d'en finir avec moi,
mais je vous ai apporté ces lettres
mais je vous ai apporté ces lettres
émanant d'associations, de prêtres,
de commerçants et de simples citoyens.
Tout le monde est d'accord.
Tout le monde est content
que les dealers aient vidé les rues.
Vous croyez
que ça va nous sauver la mise, hein ?
J'imagine que non, mais c'est tout
ce que j'ai, avec mon insigne.
Que je reprendrai peut-être, major,
mais pas aujourd'hui.
Je ne veux pas attirer l’attention
sur ce bordel
avant qu'on sache quoi dire.
Puisque vous avez des congés
à prendre, prenez-les.
Ne revenez que lorsqu'on vous appellera.
Encore une chose, monsieur.
<i>Un journaliste du Sun est au courant
de la manœuvre.</i>
Je lui ai dit que c'était pour une enquête.
Il a promis de différer l’article.
Combien de temps ?
Une semaine, tout au plus.
Je faisais équipe avec Superstroke
à la grande époque,
surtout pour du vol à la tire
et des coups minables.
J'ai pratiqué la fraude à la carte
téléphonique avant l’arrivée des portables.
Tu cryptais les numéros ?
Ouais, j'aimais bien les aéroports.
- Tu sais encore les vérifier ?
- De quoi tu parles ?
Il croit que je refile de la merde ?
Parce que si c'est ça,
on arrête tout de suite.
Putain, Bernard, c'est quoi ton trip ?
On essaie de faire du fric.
Si tu bossais pour qui je bosse,
tu protégerais un peu mieux tes miches,
c'est tout.
J'aime la prudence, je suis comme toi.
Vas-y. Fais un essai.
Marlène, t'as envoyé la copie à Paris ?
Merci, ma belle.
Ça ira. Je suis à l’aéroport. La navette, oui.
3-1-0
4-4-8-16
91-7-7-8
3-1-2. Non, c'est peut-être un sept.
Je sais jamais
avec ces touches minuscules.
On peut faire affaire.
C'est ça. Un, deux, un, deux, un, deux.
Un, deux, c'est ça. Un, deux, c'est bien.
Voilà, c'est bon. Tu commences à piger.
Baisse pas ta gauche.
Bien. Reste bien centré.
Ne te penche pas en avant.
Ne te penche pas trop. Pas trop, d'accord ?
Bon, on y va.
Ne te penche pas trop, c'est ça.
Un, deux, pivote.
Vous plaisantez. Dites-moi qu'il plaisante.
Vous plaisantez, c'est ça ?
- Nous n'étions pas au courant.
- Pas au courant ?
C'est encore pire. C'est vous, le préfet.
C'était lui.
Ne croyez pas
que nous allons porter le chapeau.
Si vous permettez,
voici des lettres de citoyens de son district.
Des prêtres, des commerçants,
des électeurs.
Que des éloges.
C'est pas une erreur de chiffres.
Ce sont des faits.
On peut nettoyer, effacer tout ça.
Même si la presse est au courant,
on trouvera une explication,
on dira que c'était une expérience.
Un piège pour les gros bonnets
de la drogue.
Si on se débrouille bien,
on peut tous être épargnés.
Éviter toute éclaboussure.
Non. Non.
Je vous faisais confiance, Erv, vraiment.
Vous avez trahi ma confiance.
Ceci peut avoir
des conséquences désastreuses.
Vous en répondrez.
C'est ainsi que ça marche, Erv.
Vous le savez comme moi.
Merci, Ervin.
Je vous verrai sous peu
pour dresser le plan détaillé
destiné à régler ce bordel rapidement.
Si vous pouviez parler de ce bordel
en lui donnant l’air...
N'y songez pas.
TÉLÉPHONES PORTABLES
Voilà comment ça marche.
Si tu reconstitues pas ta réserve
de minutes dans les 60 jours,
la société de téléphonie recycle le numéro.
C'est là qu'on les tient.
J'ai fait savoir
que je rachète les portables usagés
2 $ pièce.
On m'en a filé des centaines.
Je les apporte à ma nièce
qui manipule la base de données
et rajoute 200 minutes
sur un compte bidon.
Ce qui rallonge automatiquement
la durée de vie du portable de 60 jours.
Elle prend 20 $ sur chaque téléphone.
Où tu veux en venir ?
Poupée, un Tracfone
avec 200 ou 400 minutes
te coûtera 150 ou 200 dollars, facile.
Je te le fais à 100 $ tout rond.
Tu gagnes 50 $ par téléphone.
À condition que tu fournisses des reçus.
Ils doivent sembler provenir
de différents magasins, ou je suis cuit.
Est-ce qu'on peut faire plaisir à monsieur ?
Franchement, Calvin,
tu sais bien que c'est mon soir de loto.
Écoute, mon pote, t'as rien à faire ici
et nous, on en a marre de voir ta gueule.
C'est clair ?
Tu me connais, ça me branche pas
de voir des enfoirés de pédales.
Mais je reviendrai
tant que j'aurai pas vu Omar.
T'as qu'à faire passer le mot.
Pour la dernière fois, je le connais pas.
Alors, à demain.
Je peux vous aider ?
J'en suis tout à fait certain.
«a suffira.
Jette ton linge et retourne-toi doucement.
Alors tu vas me dťpouiller ?
Tu sais qui je suis ?
Omar, c'est Áa ?
Sors ton flingue lentement. Puis jette-le.
Je vais pas me presser.
Mais je le jetterai pas, Núud pap.
Je sais pas ce que tu veux faire,
mais t'as intťrÍt ŗ te dťpÍcher.
- Je savais que tu reviendrais.
- «a a pas dŻ t'empÍcher de dormir.
C'est comme se demander
si le soleil va se lever.
Pas de quoi s'ťnerver.
- Comment tu m'as retrouvť ?
- Ton pote a mis du temps ŗ parler.
C'est pas un bleu.
- Tu lías flinguť ?
- Il se repose.
- Je vois que tu aimes les 45 mm.
- Ce soir, oui.
Et je líutiliserai,
si c'est ce que tu veux savoir.
T'as un beau petit jouet.
Walther PPK 380 mm ŗ double dťtente.
- Apparemment, y a pas mal de dťtente.
- Si je te tire dans le bras, tu riras moins.
Ton flingue est pas assez puissant
pour me neutraliser.
Il m'empÍchera pas de vider mon chargeur.
- Tu pourrais me rater.
- ņ cette distance ? Avec ce calibre ?
- Je peux pas te rater.
- J'admire ton assurance.
Je vois pas non plus de sueur
sur ton front.
- On pourrait passer la nuit ici.
- Sans doute.
Ou rťgler Áa une bonne fois pour toutes.
J'ai quelque chose ŗ te demander.
Omar t'ťcoute.

BALTIMORE CAPITALE DU CRIME
"On n'est plus obligťs de rÍver."
- Stringer Bell
<i>- Je vais dans líouest.
- Díaccord.</i>
<i>- Cíest cool.
- ņ plus.</i>
C'est parti.
<i>- Yo, il faut que je lui parle.
- Je te rappelle, mec.</i>
«a doit Ítre Shamrock.
Admettons que Stringer Bell soit "lui",
on attend qu'il rappelle.
C'est gťnial.
Tu te rends compte, on a rťussi ŗ vendre
les tťlťphones avec micro
aux cibles.
«a durera au moins une semaine.
On a peut-Ítre ťvitť le pire.
Si on fait le mťnage tranquillement,
qu'on sort un pipeau
aux reporters qui viennent,
le maire nous oubliera peut-Ítre.
Le plan d'action est prÍt ?
DŤs qu'on en a líordre,
on ferme les trois zones
et on embarque tout le monde.
Tout sera nettoyť avant minuit.
Alors qu'est-ce qu'on attend
depuis 36 heures ?
Pourquoi la mairie ne nous appelle pas ?
<i>- Bureau du maire.
- Le prťfet de police Burrell pour le maire.</i>
- J'en ai assez entendu.
- Attends, Coleman.
Allez, laisse-le s'exprimer.
Excusez-moi, monsieur.
Le prťfet Burrell est en ligne.
- Il dit que c'est urgent.
- J'en suis sŻr.
Il veut avancer, Clarence.
Il veut rťgler Áa tout de suite, nous aussi.
Dites-lui de patienter. Je t'ťcoute, Gene.
Je ne suis pas un politicien,
je suis un intellectuel.
Mais du point de vue de la santť publique,
les zones de non-droit
se rťvŤlent incroyables.
Seringues neuves, analyses de sang
et distribution de prťservatifs.
Nous avons affaire
ŗ une communautť ŗ risque
qui est insaisissable.
Certains acceptent mÍme
de suivre un traitement.
Et Áa, c'est uniquement avec le C.H.U.
Et Bon Secours.
Avec une autorisation,
mon service pourrait engager
des dťpenses publiques.
- Vous ne comprenez pas.
- Odell ?
Quand Áa se saura,
les ministres ne vous soutiendront pas.
La majoritť du conseil municipal
prendra ses distances
avec votre administration.
Je suis sŻr que le gouverneur
et la lťgislature
en profiteront pour cracher sur la ville.
Et Washington ?
Vous imaginez
ce que le ministŤre de la Justice
vous donnera comme fil ŗ retordre ?
La criminalitť est en baisse, Odell.
Le corps mťdical me dit
que Áa peut marcher.
Je me passerai de critiques.
Bon, il faut qu'on rťflťchisse.
Pour voir si on peut continuer
sans appeler un chat un chat.
- Bon sang.
- Il doit y avoir une solution.
Je veux que tu te plonges dedans.
Erv, merci d'avoir patientť.
Oui, mais...
Oui, je comprends.
J'attends de vos nouvelles.
On cesse toutes les actions en cours
ŗ Hamsterdam.
Pas d'arrestations,
calme plat jusqu'ŗ nouvel ordre.
Il dit vouloir se regrouper.
Pour dťterminer le moyen d'action
le plus efficace.
Tu peux traduire, Erv ?
Je comprends pas son putain de jargon.
Il veut tous nous faire passer ŗ la guillotine
sans pour autant ťclabousser la mairie.
Putain, je vais pas me laisser faire.
On me rend vulnťrable.
Moi aussi, je peux donner
mon point de vue.
- Tu vas parler aux journalistes ?
- Pas moi.
Mais je connais un petit filou
qui sera ravi d'exposer
les dťboires du maire au grand jour.
Tu trouves Áa drŰle ?
Parce que dans le dossier,
je vois pas mal de subventions
gouvernementales, mais pas pour B&B.
- Tu t'attendais ŗ quoi ?
- ņ une compensation.
Pour tout ce qu'on a investi.
Du pognon
pour la rťhabilitation de Howard Street.
T'as arrosť des gens ?
- 250000 $ .
- ņ Clay Davis.
Comment tu le sais ?
Quoi ? Il s'en met plein les poches ?
- Non, il est pas aussi gonflť.
- Laisse-moi deviner.
Il t'a parlť de la pompe.
Ou de la poule aux úufs d'or ?
Tu lías dťjŗ rencontrť ?
Tu sais si ton fric est arrivť en haut lieu ?
Oui, je líai rencontrť lŗ oý il bosse.
Ah oui ? Quel bureau ?
Il est descendu dans le hall.
Il t'a bien eu.
Il te promet qu'avec du fric,
tout peut changer.
Tu le paies.
Si Áa marche, il s'en attribue le mťrite.
Sinon, il se dťbrouille
pour te faire cracher davantage.
- Clay Davis t'a bien eu.
- Non,
il m'a obtenu les permis de construire
en un rien de temps.
On parle de corruption.
Il a rťcupťrť le fric de líentrepreneur.
- Combien ?
- Pour líinstant, 35000 $ .
- Sur les 250000 $ ?
- C'est pour les pots-de-vin.
Il n'y a pas de pots-de-vin !
Tu crois vraiment qu'un sťnateur
est prÍt ŗ risquer son salaire
et son poste
en se rendant dans un building fťdťral
avec une mallette d'argent sale ?
J'ai vu Chunky Coates.
Il obtient ses subventions
comme tout le monde.
Il remplit les formulaires,
respecte les normes
et ensuite, il prie.
C'est toute une tradition, ici. Clay Davis ?
Ce type est nť
la main dans la poche de quelqu'un d'autre.
T'aurais dŻ m'en parler plus tŰt.
Shamrock rappelle Bodie.
<i>Reste vague.</i>
<i>Yo, le mec a dit
quíil te verrait ŗ la mÍme heure.</i>
<i>- Tu sais oý.
- La premiŤre fois,</i>
Sydnor surveillait Shamrock
ŗ Baltimore ouest.
D'accord ? Regardez-moi Áa.
Au mÍme moment,
Stringer Bell ťtait ŗ líimprimerie.
C'ťtait pas une rencontre de visu.
On a interceptť aucun appel
entre Stringer et Shamrock.
Comment Áa se fait ?
Le tťlťphone de Stringer est
sur le mÍme rťseau que ceux de son gang.
- Exact.
- Bell n'utilise pas les portables de Bernard.
Shamrock appelle Bell
avec un autre tťlťphone.
On ne peut pas entendre les appels
parce que le systŤme est segmentť.
Ils sont rusťs, ces fils de pute.
Une semaine avec les portables
de Bernard et tout le monde
jusqu'ŗ Shamrock sera impliquť.
Mais Bell et Barksdale ?
Rien, ŗ moins qu'on rťussisse
ŗ choper leur numťro de portable.
- Oý tu vas ?
- Au magasin de jouets.
- Lťgalisation partielle de la drogue ?
- C'est pas tout.
Le major Colvin n'a plus le recul nťcessaire
pour commander.
On nous a demandť de rťduire
la criminalitť d'ici la fin de líannťe,
il a mal rťagi ŗ la pression.
La pression exercťe par qui ? Le maire ?
Tout ce que je dis,
c'est que tout le monde
a souffert de cette pression,
du Q.G. Aux chefs de districts,
en passant par les chefs d'ťquipes
et de secteurs.
Ils vendent de la drogue
avec la bťnťdiction de la police ŗ líouest ?
La police est prÍte
ŗ mettre fin ŗ ces inepties
avec des arrestations massives.
- Je m'en occupe.
- Qu'est-ce que vous attendez ?
Le maire nous demande d'attendre.
Pourquoi ?
Je crois qu'il va se donner en spectacle.
Il va me rendre responsable de trucs
qui n'ont rien ŗ voir avec moi,
mais sont liťs
aux pressions que la mairie a exercťes
sur mes hommes.
Parler ŗ la presse pour incriminer la mairie,
c'est tout ce qui me reste ŗ faire, non ?
Je vais coincer Royce
avant qu'il ne me coince.
- Et vous voulez que moi, je...
- Non, pas vous.
Votre pote, Tony Gray.
S'il s'attaque ŗ Royce,
il va avoir besoin de munitions, non ?
Je ne connais pas Gray,
c'est vous que je connais.
M. Le conseiller, vous me devez une faveur.
- «a va, le craque ?
- J'ai une question technique.
Les unitťs analogiques
pour retrouver des numťros de portables ?
- Líidentificateur quelque chose.
- Oui, líidentificateur de frťquences G.S.M.
- Le Triggerfish.
- Oui. Il pouvait retrouver un numťro.
Avec le vieux systŤme analogique,
il fallait suivre le type
pendant qu'il tťlťphonait.
Avec le numťrique ?
Tu retrouves le numťro instantanťment.
T'en as que je pourrais t'emprunter ?
- Et les vŰtres ?
- Quoi ?
La police en a trois, si je me souviens bien.
Le dťpartement de la Sťcuritť en a envoyť
ŗ tous les services du comtť.
Sans dťconner.
Merci.
- J'avais des doutes.
- C'est ťnorme.
Si on agit comme il faut.
Il veut que je passe líinfo ŗ Tony Gray
pour qu'il s'en serve.
Si Tony se prťsente contre le maire,
il crachera sur lui, pas sur la police.
On devrait peut-Ítre informer Tony,
qu'il ait ses chances contre le maire.
Mais d'abord, renseigne-toi sur le sujet.
- Tu connais ce major Colvin ?
- On a bien dŻ se serrer la main.
Si Burrell líaccuse,
Colvin a peut-Ítre h‚te
de donner sa version des faits.
McNulty, unitť spťciale.
Sullivan, irritations bťnignes.
Vous avez un truc
comme le I.F.G.S.M., mais numťrique ?
Pour trouver des numťros ?
- Trouver quoi ?
- Un appareil Triggerfish.
Triggerfish. Pour les numťros de portables.
Je peux peut-Ítre jeter un úil ?
Oui, ici le conseiller Carcetti.
<i>- J'essaie de joindre le major Colvin.
- Il est en vacances.</i>
Je sais,
mais c'est au sujet d'affaires municipales.
<i>Je peux vous passer sa boÓte vocale.</i>
Non, pas sa boÓte vocale.
<i>- Je dois lui parler tout de suite.
- Tout de suite ?</i>
<i>- Oui.
- Et son portable ?</i>
<i>- Son portable ? Ce serait parfait.
- TrŤs bien.</i>
Bon, Áa suffit.
Oui, je sais, Áa fait mal.
Mais vos poings, ce sera du bťton, aprŤs.
Justin, viens lŗ.
Frappe-moi ŗ la poitrine.
T'es pas obligť d'y aller fort.
- T'ťtais comme Áa.
- Aucun poids sur les talons.
Exact. Pas de centre de gravitť.
Si t'es bien placť,
ta hanche peut t'aider ŗ frapper.
Compris ?
- C'est de lŗ que vient ta force.
- Oui, mais quand on se fait frapper ?
- Quoi ?
- Si on se fait frapper, mÍme avec Áa,
on tombe.
- Il est dťglinguť.
- Le sac de frappe aussi.
Oý est-ce que t'as trouvť ce matos ?
Chez les Pierrafeu ?
Non, il a dit "Personne."
Tu vas devoir attendre ici.
Comment Áa ? Tu sais qui je suis ?
Y a un type qui veut voir Avon.
Je dois attendre pour voir mon associť.
- Il est nouveau, String.
- Je m'en fous.
Y a pas mal de nouveaux. Trop ŗ mon goŻt.
Tirez-vous.
- Oý est Avon ?
- Il va pas tarder.
Tant mieux, c'est toi que je voulais voir.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
J'ai besoin que tu descendes quelqu'un.
- Qui c'est ?
- Clay Davis.
Le cťlŤbre Clay Davis ?
Celui de la mairie ?
T'essaies de me faire passer un message ?
- Il faut le descendre.
- C'est pas un problŤme.
Mais lŗ, on parle d'assassinat...
Je te dis de descendre un mec, tu obťis.
- Un point c'est tout.
- Je sais pas...
Je dois te rappeler pour qui tu bosses ?
Yo.
Je crois que Slim va pas pouvoir, lŗ.
Tu veux descendre
un sťnateur, maintenant ?
Si tu descends un mec important
comme lui,
Áa passera pas inaperÁu.
On aura la police sur le dos,
le F.B.I., la totale.
Il te faut un vrai pro
pour faire ce boulot,
- pas d'un pauvre type comme Slim.
- Il nous a volť du fric.
J'en ťtais sŻr.
- Faut qu'il disparaisse.
- Non, t'es un homme d'affaires.
Tu dois gťrer Áa autrement.
Tu vas pas te la jouer gangster, si ?
Je t'avais dit que c'ťtait pas ton truc.
Ouais.
Ils t'ont vu venir de loin
avec ta face de racaille.
T'as un problŤme ? C'est ŗ toi de le rťgler.
On le dirige vers líantenne la plus proche,
celle par laquelle passent les appels
entrants et sortants de Bell,
et c'est parti.
Putain.
On dirait les pages blanches de la ville
sans les noms.
Mais le signal saura le trouver.
Si on sait ŗ quelle heure Bell a tťlťphonť,
on peut essayer d'analyser
les appels correspondants.
Il peut y en avoir des milliers.
C'est la ligne de fond,
mais avec un deuxiŤme essai,
Áa ťliminera dťjŗ pas mal de monde.
- Et aprŤs trois ou quatre...
- On aura son numťro.
Dire que ce truc prenait la poussiŤre
au service des renseignements.
On va plus les l‚cher, maintenant, Lester.
Ils connaissent pas encore
cette technologie.
Pour une fois, ils ne peuvent pas s'adapter.
C'est gťnial.
Il te faut quelque chose ?
- Combien tu te fais ?
- Quoi ?
Sur les t-shirts ? Combien tu te fais ?
Une petite marge. C'est tout.
Tu devrais vendre des sweaters ŗ capuche.
Avec le changement de saison.
T'es d'oý ?
Capsules jaunes, capsules jaunes.
- Bodie Broadus.
- Líhomme aux poings d'acier.
On m'a dit que t'ouvrais une salle de sport.
Oui, enfin, j'essaie.
- Je voudrais voir Avon.
- Je croyais que t'avais raccrochť.
C'est pour Áa que je viens te voir.
Vu comment je suis parti,
je peux pas dťbarquer comme Áa.
Yo, c'est moi.
Je suis avec un tueur ŗ gages.
Le soldat qui a raccrochť.
Il veut voir le boss.
Si tu continues ŗ ce train-lŗ,
tu vas clamser, un jour.
C'est bon.
J'essaie de t'expliquer,
mais tu veux rien savoir.
C'est bon, Áa va.
T-shirts blancs, t-shirts blancs. Trois
pour le prix d'un, cinq pour le prix de trois.
T-shirts pas chers, t-shirts pas chers.
T-shirts blancs, t-shirts blancs. Trois
pour le prix d'un, cinq pour le prix de trois.
T-shirts pas chers.
T-shirts pas chers !
<i>Bon, quíest-ce que tu veux que je lui dise ?</i>
<i>Je le prťviens et je te rappelle.</i>
- Shamrock.
- 16 h 40.
<i>- Entreprises B&B.
- On devrait dťjeuner ensemble.</i>
D'accord. Attends, je te rappelle.
<i>- Yo.
- Salut, cíest moi.</i>
Quoi de neuf ?
C'est moi.
<i>Dis au tueur ŗ gages
que le boss va passer le chercher.</i>
<i>- Bien.
- 16 h 47.</i>
Une fenÍtre de sept minutes.
892 numťros de tťlťphone.
C'est la ligne de fond. «a vient.
Oui.
DEMANDES DE SUBVENTIONS F…D…RALES
Toi, tu bouges pas.
Yo.
PORTABLE DE BELL
POUR AFFAIRES L…GALES
Jimmy, sur son tťlťphone rťglo.
Il vient d'appeler ton ami.
Celui dont tu m'as donnť la carte.
- Il líappelle ŗ son bureau ?
- Sur son portable.
Il faut qu'on s'inquiŤte ?
Non.
- Un club de boxe ?
- C'est pas encore tout ŗ fait Áa.
C'est pour Áa que je voulais te voir.
Tu sais comment gťrer un truc pareil ?
Pas du tout. Mais la boxe, Áa me connaÓt.
Y a des gosses qui sont intťressťs.
Mais ce qu'il me faut, c'est du matos.
Sinon, les gosses vont s'esquinter.
Il leur faut des casques, des protections,
des coquilles,
pour supporter les coups.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire.
T'ťtais sur tous les posters de boxe,
ŗ líťpoque.
- C'ťtaient des petits combats.
- Oui, mais t'as ťtť Gants d'Or.
Quelque temps,
mais j'avais un dťfaut physique.
- Une m‚choire en verre ?
- Non, c'est mon front.
- Une balle dans le front, Áa fait mal.
- Bon, regarde.
Tu vois ces sacs de frappe ?
Lls tiennent tout seuls.
Il suffit d'ajouter de líeau.
Il y a aussi des punching-balls.
Et des casques. Le dernier modŤle.
Ils protŤgent les joues et le menton.
Tu vois ?
Je sais que je pourrais trouver
un dollar par-ci, un dollar par-lŗ.
Mais je voudrais sťlectionner
quelques gars, tu vois ?
Ce sera le club du Cercle d'or,
les membres feront une petite contribution
et le club sera lancť.
Je mettrai leur nom et leur photo
au mur de la salle.
- Tu veux que je fasse partie du club ?
- Non, je dis Áa comme Áa.
Il y a plusieurs niveaux.
Le club d'Argent, le club de Bronze.
Pour les mecs qui veulent pas
l‚cher trop de thune.
Allez, mon pote, regarde.
Non, j'ai pas de temps pour ces conneries.
Je veux pas qu'il y ait ma photo au mur.
T'es dingue ? T'as besoin de combien ?
10000 $ .
Tout Áa pour 10000 $ ?
Slim, va lui chercher 15000 $ en liquide.
Yo...
Putain.
Allez. ņ plus, mon pote.
Occupe-toi bien de ces gosses.
T'inquiŤte, mon pote.
<i>- Oui.
- Tu lui as parlť ?</i>
<i>Le gros veut te parler.</i>
<i>- D'accord, Áa roule. Organise un truc.
- «a marche.</i>
T'as regardť ce que je t'ai envoyť ?
Ouais, les infos sont bonnes.
On peut parler sťrieusement, alors ?
<i>- Dis-lui que cíest bon pour demain.
- Díaccord, je te rappelle.</i>
- Lŗ, on chauffe.
- On brŻle.
Au prochain coup de fil de Stringer,
c'est bon.
Terminť.
C'est pas ce que tu crois.
C'est mon frŤre.
Mais si Áa continue comme Áa...
Merde.
T'as des problŤmes ?
J'ai remuť pas mal de merde
avec Hamsterdam.
C'est parce que t'es derriŤre tout Áa
que je suis venu te voir.
On essaie tous les deux
de remettre de líordre dans ce bordel.
Je t'ťcoute, Russell.
C'est bon, je vous laisse ?
Oui.
On vous attend devant. Allons-y, P-Square.
- T'as líair en forme.
- Pour un type qui s'est fait tirer dessus.
Tu es allť voir quelqu'un
qui m'a engagť
pour que je protŤge tes tours.
J'avais confiance en cette personne,
car elle te reprťsentait.
Exact.
J'ai donc ťloignť
ces messieurs de Baltimore est.
J'ai respectť mon contrat,
du moins tant que
j'en ťtais capable physiquement.
C'est vrai.
Ton homme a organisť une rencontre
au bar de Butchie.
Il a dit ŗ Omar Little que j'ťtais responsable
des tortures infligťes ŗ un jeune homme
trŤs cher ŗ M. Little.
En consťquence, ton homme
a cherchť ŗ me faire disparaÓtre.
Omar t'a dit Áa et tu lías cru ?
C'est pas le genre de personne
ŗ raconter des histoires.
MÍme ŗ líarticle de la mort.
Merde.
La came de Proposition Joe.
Le rŤglement interne de ton organisation
ne m'intťresse pas.
S'il y a une faÁon de...
S'il a fait une bourde,
je suis prÍt ŗ en payer le prix.
Comment on peut rťgler Áa ?
Tu veux de líargent ?
- De líargent ?
- Oui, on fait des affaires.
Maintenant, tu es un homme d'affaires.
Tu es arrivť lŗ gr‚ce ŗ ta parole
et ŗ ta rťputation.
Avec, tu peux encore traiter avec New York.
Sans, t'es fini.
Il est toujours en conditionnelle.
Je peux t'aider ŗ le pincer
avec de líartillerie lourde.
Je parle pas de petits flingues,
mais de TEC-9,
des fusils... ils ont mÍme des grenades.
Arrestation assurťe.
Tu pourrais peut-Ítre limiter sa peine
ŗ cinq ans.
Si vous faites une descente,
ses gars vont essayer de le couvrir.
Ils vont dire que les armes sont ŗ eux.
Pince-le pour ne pas avoir respectť
les conditions de sa libťration.
Je peux rien te promettre.
- Il va prendre au moins cinq ans.
- ArrÍte.
- Lui et moi...
- Je vais faire de mon mieux, d'accord ?
Il est toujours lŗ-bas ?
Non, Áa change. Mais il est souvent lŗ-bas
depuis que c'est la guerre.
Il a dŻ te faire quelque chose.
Non, c'est juste les affaires.
J'allais oublier.
C'est arrivť pour toi hier soir.
Elle a appelť ton portable,
t'as pas rťpondu.
Elle avait une jolie voix,
comme un petit chat.
ņ nous.
<i>- Il veut que tu sois lŗ, demi-portion.
- Díaccord.</i>
- Stringer Bell, c'est lui.
- On lía.
Pendant combien de temps ?
Il peut s'en dťbarrasser ŗ tout moment.
- Je m'occupe de Rhonda, prťviens Daniels.
- Bien.
- On a le numťro de Stringer.
- Lieutenant.
Allez voir le juge.
J'arrive avec une dťclaration.
- Lester prťvient Daniels.
- McNulty appelle Pearlman.
Surveille tes placements de pieds.
Bien. Maintenant, attaque-le.
Oui. Vas-y, attaque.
- Je suis trop fort.
- Cr‚ne pas trop.
Quand est-ce qu'il y aura
de vrais combats ? Avec des tournois.
- Ouais, on est des gladiateurs.
- Vous avez le cran, mais pas la technique.
Vous Ítes pas encore prÍts
pour le vrai truc.
Mais peut-Ítre que Áa vous fera du bien
de vous frotter ŗ des inconnus.
Si un mec est sur mon territoire,
je líexplose.
J'ai rencontrť des mecs
au club de Pennsylvania Avenue.
Je vais voir
s'ils veulent bien vous affronter.
- Super.
- D'accord.
Vous ne rappelez pas les conseillers ?
Je suis en congť, cette semaine.
Des congťs forcťs.
Oui. Je sais pourquoi.
Je voudrais avoir votre point de vue. Sinon,
tout ce que Burrell dira
sera parole d'…vangile.
Vous Ítes d'accord ?
Qu'avez-vous fait, major ?
Pourquoi les zones existent encore ?
La stratťgie maladroite
des forces de líordre
- ne sert ŗ rien !
- Je crois vraiment...
Il y a vraiment un os, Clarence.
Si tu continues comme Áa,
tu seras considťrť comme le flťau du pays.
Je sais que nous avons líair vulnťrables.
Mais si on applique la lťgislation
sur les drogues partout ailleurs en ville,
de faÁon agressive,
comment peuvent-ils dire
qu'on ne maintient pas líordre ?
Il doit y avoir un juste milieu.
Il doit y avoir une faÁon de procťder
sans provoquer de chaos.
Sans provoquer de chaos.
C'ťtait líune des pires rues de mon district.
C'est ici qu'un flic s'est fait descendre
líťtť dernier ?
- Dozerman.
- «a a líair plutŰt calme.
Comme toutes les rues de mon district.
G-man.
- Quoi de neuf ?
- Ferme la porte.
Dans 10 mn, on aura une dťclaration
sous serment ŗ faire signer par le juge.
- Pour le portable de Russell Bell.
- Bien jouť.
Si le fournisseur d'accŤs
traite Áa rapidement.
Tu me dois bien Áa, Fitz.
Ce matin, on a appris pour le port,
des trucs pas trŤs jolis chez toi.
Dťbrouille-toi, fais en sorte de m'obtenir
cette autorisation de mise sur ťcoute.
Ils ťtaient dans des vťhicules
il y a deux mois, ŗ localiser des appels
et ŗ nettoyer les rues.
Lŗ, ils travaillent sur de vraies enquÍtes.
Plus de travail, moins de conneries,
d'oý les meilleures statistiques.
Les chiffres ne sont pas truquťs.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il a fait ?
- 14 pillages d'ťglises.
Allons-y.
Mademoiselle.
«a se prononce comment ce truc-lŗ ?
J'ai jamais vraiment su.
Ce Bell, tu le traques depuis longtemps,
pas vrai, Jimmy ?
Un petit moment.
Ce nom me dit quelque chose.
Il y a quelques annťes, c'ťtait lui le...
Oui.
Ce qui est fait est fait.
Maintenant, l‚che líaffaire, bon sang.
Allez.
En tant que dťclarant,
jurez-vous solennellement
et attestez-vous
que les informations de ce...
La baisse de la criminalitť
est la plus importante
de ces derniŤres annťes.
Il reste encore quelques durs ŗ cuire
dans les rues.
Sergent, vous savez, les petites motos ?
Elle m'empÍchent de dormir.
On s'en occupe.
J'ai passť toute ma vie dans ce quartier.
Vous savez, on n'ťtait pas des anges,
quand on ťtait jeunes.
Ces durs ŗ cuire dont vous parlez,
la plupart d'entre eux jouent aux durs.
Ils ne sont pas si diffťrents de nous.
C'est juste leur tenue, qui a changť.
Ce qui me manque, dans ce quartier...
Le quartier dans lequel j'ai grandi.
Nous, on connaissait la police.
Il y avait un policier blanc.
Il passait devant notre maison.
Il s'asseyait un moment,
il parlait avec ma mŤre
presque tous les soirs.
Il s'asseyait sur le perron et il discutait.
Ce type s'appelait Frazier O'Leary.
- Il tutoyait mÍme ma grand-mŤre.
- Bien.
Passons aux informations
sur la ligne spťciale...
Dťsolťe, mon chou, mais j'avais pas fini.
Je vais vous dire.
«a faisait longtemps que je n'avais pas vu
de police ŗ visage humain.
TrŤs longtemps.
Jusqu'ŗ la semaine derniŤre.
J'ťtais assise sur le perron,
un jeune flic noir est arrivť,
il m'a donnť sa carte.
Il s'appelle Reggie Ballard.
Il s'est assis, il m'a parlť. On a discutť.
Maintenant, il me connaÓt et je le connais.
Vous voyez ?
Vous voulez que je vous dise ?
C'est Áa qui manque.
Mon fils veut ouvrir un stand de glaces
dans la rue.
On a besoin d'un permis ?
Vous avez dťjŗ vu une rťunion de quartier
comme celle-ci ?
Les types de Minor Privileges m'ont dit
que les stands ťtaient interdits
sur la voie publique.
Mais vous pouvez ouvrir
un stand de glaces
sur le trottoir.
Que cherchez-vous vraiment ?
- Ce n'est pas votre district.
- «a m'intťresse.
Et je dirige le sous-comitť de sťcuritť.
Vous voyez ce b‚timent ?
C'ťtait le b‚timent Stryker.
Une boutique de pompes funŤbres.
Le dernier arrÍt avant le cimetiŤre
pour les Blancs de líouest,
quand il en restait encore dans le quartier.
ņ líťpoque oý le systŤme de discrimination
s'est fissurť,
au dťbut des annťes 60,
quelqu'un a demandť ŗ Stryker:
"Stryker,
"tu vas changer ton rŤglement
"et enterrer les Noirs ?"
Stryker a rťpondu:
"Oui, ŗ une seule condition.
"Que je puisse tous les enterrer
en mÍme temps."
C'est triste.
Mais vous savez quoi ? J'avais
beaucoup de respect pour cet homme.
Contrairement ŗ beaucoup d'autres,
je savais toujours exactement
ce qu'il faisait.
Je fais mon boulot.
Je vous ai montrť líespoir.
Je vais vous montrer la crasse.
Salut.
- Pourquoi si vite ?
- Le prťnom de Stringer Bell.
- Russell.
- Pour líinstant ?
Ahmed.
On est au sommet de la montagne.
AUTORISATION
Capsules rouges ŗ vendre.
- C'est ici ?
- líune des trois zones.
Comment vous avez fait ?
Je líai fait.
J'en avais marre d'entendre des types
parler de ce qu'il faudrait faire,
ou de ce qu'ils feraient
s'ils pouvaient dťcider.
- J'ai de la came, de la came.
- Vous voulez laisser votre empreinte ?
Non, je n'ai pas cherchť aussi loin.
Je ne crie pas non plus victoire.
Je suis content d'avoir essayť.
Descendez. Je vous attends ici.
Vous ne m'accompagnez pas ?
C'est pas beau ŗ voir.
- Mais c'est sans danger.
- Destruction massive assurťe !
C'est un chemin ŗ parcourir tout seul.
Capsules jaunes, j'ai des capsules jaunes.
- Je t'en ai commandť un.
- Merci.
- Mon appel t'a ťtonnť ?
- Un peu.
Vu la faÁon dont Áa s'est terminť.
Je suis une hyperactive, Jimmy.
Les gens comme moi manquent de tact.
Quand je me calme
et que je rťflťchis une minute, je...
C'est ta faÁon de t'excuser ?
Je n'ai pas fait une heure de voiture
pour m'excuser.
Tu m'as manquť.
Moi aussi.
«a fait quand mÍme un sacrť trajet
pour me dire Áa
et repartir ŗ Washington dans la foulťe.
Je ne rentre pas ce soir.
H‘TEL HARBOR MAGIC
Quoi de neuf ? T'es sur un coup ?
Un sacrť coup.
Et toi ? Du nouveau ?
J'ai entendu
un truc un peu fou sur Baltimore
dans le flot des rumeurs de Washington.
- Vraiment ?
- Une espŤce
de commandant de police rebelle
qui prendrait sur lui
de lťgaliser la drogue dans son district ?
Le maire ne serait mÍme pas au courant ?
- Tu imagines ?
- Une histoire de fou.
Quelqu'un...
Je crois qu'il s'appelle Colvin.
Tu le connais ?
Non, pas vraiment.
Mais je trouve drŰle
qu'un bavard de Washington
connaisse le nom d'un flic de Baltimore.
«a m'a intriguťe.
…coute, je crois...
- Tu pars ?
- Oui, Áa vaut mieux.
Bonsoir.
Merde, cette piaule me manque dťjŗ.
Tu passes pas mal de temps ailleurs
- ŗ rťgler tes affaires.
- Oui.
Dommage qu'on soit obligťs
de s'occuper de ce Marlo.
Si je m'en ťtais occupť plus tŰt...
Il y aura toujours un Marlo.
Pas de Marlo, pas de business.
T'aurais pu t'en occuper un peu plus tŰt.
Mais faut pas que Áa te contrarie.
Ce soir, je me dťtends
et je profite de la vue.
Regarde-moi Áa. C'est dingue, non ?
J'ai un appart qui donne sur le port.
C'est lŗ que... On parcourait cet endroit,
tous les agents de sťcuritť
nous collaient au cul.
- C'est normal.
- C'est vrai.
- Et puis une fois...
- Le magasin de jouets ?
Je t'avais dit
de pas voler le jeu de badminton.
"Qu'est-ce que tu vas foutre avec un filet
"et une raquette ?
On n'a mÍme pas de jardin."
Et toi: "Ce blanc-bec
va pas laisser son comptoir
"pour me poursuivre."
- Mais il lía fait.
- Il a dit...
- J'ai hallucinť.
- C'ťtait Carl Lewis en personne.
On avait les poings serrťs.
Toi aussi, t'as dťcampť vite fait.
Tu te filais des coups, t'ťtais furax.
C'ťtait le dťlire.
C'ťtait juste ici. Putain.
Si j'avais eu le fric que j'ai maintenant,
j'aurais pu acheter
une bonne partie du front de mer.
Sans dťconner.
Laisse tomber tout Áa.
RÍve avec moi.
On n'est plus obligťs de rÍver.
Tout Áa, on lía...
Líimmobilier, c'est bien rťel.
Faut pas que je me dťfonce trop, ce soir.
Je dois aller sur le chantier, demain.
Le Polaque qui bosse pour nous,
faut que je le fasse parler.
S'il est de mŤche avec ce Clay Davis,
il peut dire adieu ŗ sa thune, ce petit pťdť.
Vous vous voyez ŗ quelle heure ?
Midi, je crois. Pourquoi ?
T'as besoin d'un coup de main ?
Non, je voulais juste savoir oý tu serais.
Faut que tu te dťtendes, mon pote.
Quand j'aurai le temps, d'accord.
Je me prends pas trop la tÍte
avec le boulot.
C'est bien.
C'est juste du business.
ņ nous, mon pote.
ņ nous.
Vas-y, Andrť, attaque.
Allez, Spider, attaque. Vas-y.
Doucement.
- «a va ?
- Oui, c'est bon.
D'accord.
- ņ toi, Ditty.
- Pourquoi t'as pas ripostť ?
ņ toi, Justin.
Allez, je t'ai appelť.
Bon, ťcoutez.
On va faire trois rounds de deux minutes.
…vitez les coups bas. Touchez les gants.
C'est parti...
Vas-y, Justin.
Allez. Allez.
C'est bien, parfait.
Une droite, vas-y.
LŤve les mains.
- Allez, mon pote.
- Faut que tu contres.
Il donne ses coups ŗ droite.
Attaque-toi ŗ ses faiblesses.
- Il t'arrive pas ŗ la taille.
- Gong.
- C'ťtait rapide.
- Je sais.
Bois de líeau et crache.
- Tu te sens bien ?
- «a tourne.
C'est pour Áa que je te rťpŤte
que tu dois respirer.
Alors ? T'as eu ton compte ?
- Non, Áa va aller.
- TrŤs bien.
- Allez, Justin.
- Allez, Justin !
- Allez.
- Vas-y !
- Attaque.
- Allez.
Un direct. Envoie-lui un direct.
Appel reÁu:
C'est ŗ nous. Le voici.
<i>- Cíest moi.
- Tías des nouvelles du gros ?</i>
<i>- Ouais.
- On est un peu justes ?</i>
<i>- Un paquet de moins.
- Ouais, cíest juste.</i>
<i>- Cherry lía dit.
- Dis-lui que je míen occupe.</i>
<i>Díaccord. Ah oui, autre chose.</i>
<i>- Quoi ?
- Les deux tueurs que tu voulais.</i>
<i>- Il est díaccord.
- Pas au tťlťphone.</i>
- C'est bon.
- On le tient.
Bien jouť.
C'est assez clair.
Super !
T'es pas obligť d'y retourner.
T'as rien ŗ prouver.
Ma mŤre me frappait plus fort que Áa.
Il me reste une chance, il se fatigue.
Bois et crache.
- PrÍt.
- T'es plus que prÍt.
- T'es un coq de combat.
- Allez, Justin.
Justin !
DANGER - PORT DE CASQUE
- Il y a des entrťes secondaires ?
- Elles sont barricadťes.
On va devoir passer par líentrťe principale.
«a va te faire un changement, hein ?
Tiens-toi prÍt, Núud pap.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
Respire, petit. Respire.
Gants contre gants.
- C'ťtait comment ?
- T'as encore pas mal ŗ apprendre.
Mais psychologiquement ?
Tu t'en es bien sorti.
Rentre chez toi, soldat. T'as fini ta journťe.
Je comprends tout, maintenant.
Toi, les sous-traitants
et ce politicien de mes deux,
vous m'avez bien eu, hein ?
- M. Bell, je ne sais pas...
- Minable !
On va rťgler toutes ces conneries.
Et si Áa file pas droit,
tu me le paieras,
d'une faÁon ou d'une autre.
Je comprends votre mťcontentement,
mais on a quand mÍme avancť.
- Avancť !
- Je ne sais vraiment pas
ce qui s'est passť avec Davis.
Mais si vous n'Ítes pas content de Clayton,
il faut que vous rťgliez Áa...
- Merde.
- Mon Dieu.
Je vous en prie.
Non, mon Dieu...
Je suis pas armť.
J'ai rien ŗ voir dans tout Áa.
Je fais plus dans les histoires de gangster.
Vous voulez quoi ? De la thune ?
C'est Áa ?
Si c'est Áa, je vous serai plus utile vivant.
Tu piges toujours pas, hein ?
Hein ?
On n'en veut pas ŗ ton fric.
Ton pote t'a vendu.
Ouais. Et on n'a pas eu ŗ le torturer.
Bon, ben on dirait
que rien ne vous fera changer d'avis.
Alors faites votre boulot, fils de...

- Qui est sur le coup ?
- Massey et Crutchfield.
Norris est en route pour la morgue.
Il y sera avant les cadavres.
- Et le labo criminel ?
- Il a assez d'oxygène ?
On s'occupe bien de lui, patron.
On est bons.
On a un témoin pour l’instant.
Vous savez ce que ça veut dire.
Pour l’instant, c'est G.N.G.F.
Kraw vient de vivre le gros choc de sa vie.
La mairie a déjà appelé deux fois,
ils sont très inquiets.
Sans blague.
L’homme assis là a versé
pas mal d'argent pour la campagne.
- Alors, qu'est-ce qu'on a ?
- Deux tireurs avec des semi-automatiques.
L’une des victimes est un dealer de l’ouest
avec un casier bien chargé.
L’autre était un gros bonnet mis sur écoute
par l’équipe de Daniels.
Une exécution liée à la drogue.
Avec un grand promoteur immobilier
au milieu, quel est le lien ?
La deuxième victime, Russell Bell.
Ce bâtiment lui appartenait.
Comme bien d'autres en ville.
Un riche promoteur immobilier.
Vous saviez que Russell Bell
était un gros bonnet de la drogue ?
D'où venait son argent, à votre avis ?
Je n'ai pas cherché à le savoir.
Vous n'avez pas vu les tireurs ?
Je vous l’ai dit, je n'en ai vu qu'un.
Il était noir, grand et baraqué, je dirais,
avec un gros flingue.
G.N.G.F.
Grand noir, gros flingue.
Il y en a deux autres en haut.
Bon.
Que la balistique essaie de faire le lien
avec les affaires des six derniers mois.
Je le tenais, Bunk.
Sur écoute. Je le tenais.
Et il ne le saura jamais.

"On se bastonne pour ce bobard."
- Slim Charles.
La boxe, c'est super.
Je me rappelle que tu aimais ça. Pas moi.
Je détestais regarder.
Oui, je sais. Alors, ça va ?
- Je vis au jour le jour.
- Parce que je me disais qu'on pourrait...
Je suis fière de toi, Dennis.
Prends soin de toi.
Ferme cette porte, bordel.
Et puis merde.
Je suis prêt pour la baston.
Ces enculés nous narguent grave.
T'as vu ? Non mais, t'y crois ?
On n'aurait jamais vu ça avec...
Yo, Slim. T'as qu'un mot à dire.
Un mot et on y va.
La guerre est déclarée.
Alors, B ?
Ça va ?
On va faire payer cet enculé, c'est clair.
- Faire payer qui ?
- Marlo.
- On va le crever.
- Marlo. C'est pas lui qui a fait ça.
Il aurait pas pu buter String comme ça.
Il est mort à cause de son autre business.
Quoi ?
Il est mort à cause d'autre chose.
J'ai rien pu faire. J'ai essayé.
String avait raison là-dessus, mon pote.
Il avait raison. Oublie Marlo.
Oublie cette putain de guerre.
Toutes ces bastons
pour quelques putains de coins de rues.
Rien à foutre de qui a fait quoi à qui.
C'est trop tard.
Mais la guerre est déclarée,
on peut pas revenir en arrière.
Merde, c'est ça la guerre, non ?
Quand on est dedans, on est dedans !
Si c'est parti d'un bobard,
on se bastonne pour ce bobard.
Mais on peut pas éviter la baston.
On a retrouvé ça dans ses poches.
Ça me laisse perplexe.
- C'est la puce d'un portable.
- Oh.
- Quoi d'autre ?
- 200 $ en liquide, des clés, son permis.
Son adresse sur President Street ?
J'ai envoyé Landsman
chercher un mandat de perquisition.
Oublie la politique cinq minutes.
- Et s'il avait raison ?
- De vouloir légaliser la drogue ?
La criminalité a baissé dans son district
et les habitants ont l’air content.
Écoute, si tu ne réagis pas,
que va-t-il se passer ?
Si Tommy Carcetti se tait là-dessus,
que va-t-il se passer ?
Le maire et Burrell vont tout arrêter.
Le maire doit essayer d'y mettre un terme
en faisant croire
que c'était la police,
au cas où la presse s'en mêle.
Sinon, il y aurait déjà mis un terme.
Ça paraît sensé, mais quoi qu'il arrive,
la petite expérience de Colvin est terminée.
Voyons, Tommy.
Tu as de bonnes cartes en mains,
c'est à toi de jouer.
M. Le maire, parlez de légalisation
et mon bureau ne vous suivra pas.
C'est entendu. Personne ne le fera.
Une baisse du danger ?
Si le taux de criminalité
est aussi à la baisse, oui.
Une baisse du danger. Ça me plaît.
Steven, et si on pouvait suggérer
une limitation des petites sentences ?
On se concentrerait
sur les gros trafiquants.
Ce serait bien perçu ?
Si j'arrive à des résultats concrets,
peut-être.
Mais je doute qu'un changement
de méthode soit possible à présent.
Et si on interdisait
aux gros trafiquants d'entrer
dans la zone de non-droit,
que tous les gros...
Que les gros trafiquants
étaient toujours notre cible ?
Vous suggérez une espèce
de critère d'admission pour y dealer ?
- Sur quelle base ?
- Je n'en sais rien.
Je dis cela pour redorer notre image !
Allez, bon sang,
mettez-y du vôtre, messieurs !
<i>Ça craint, pas vrai ?</i>
<i>Faut crever Marlo et son gang.</i>
<i>- On va tous les fumer. Tu vas voir.
- Bon, tiens-moi au courant.</i>
Voilà ce qui se dit, en tout cas.
Ils disent tous
que c'est le gang de Marlo Stanfield,
ce qui veut dire
que ça va tirer dans tous les sens.
Où est Jimmy ?
Il est allé perquisitionner chez Stringer
avec Bunk Moreland.
- Comment il prend ça ?
- Comme s'il avait perdu de la famille.
<i>- Oui ?
- Tignasse.</i>
<i>- Faut qu’on se parle.
- Que se passe-t-il, major ?</i>
<i>J’ai un truc pour vous tous.</i>
<i>Mount Vernon Square, dans une heure.</i>
Ça marche.
On est chez Stringer ?
Oui.
Putain, après qui je courais ?
LA RICHESSE DES NATIONS - ADAM SMITH
Ce qui est fait est fait.
Ces putains de tarlouzes. Je rêve.
Ils cognaient vraiment trop fort.
Allez, viens.
Viens.
Vu que nous sommes chez toi,
tu sauras mieux en disposer.
- On ne travaille pas aujourd'hui ?
- Ça risque d'être permanent.
Je leur ai parlé de ma petite expérience.
Ça ne leur a pas plu, c'est ça ?
Bref, c'est pour ça que je t'ai appelé.
Ton ami Barksdale
prépare une petite guerre.
On m'a informé
que beaucoup d'armes circulaient.
Des canons sciés,
des semi-automatiques, des Mac-11.
Tu pourrais faire une bonne saisie.
- Sacré tuyau.
- Ouais.
C'est peut-être le dernier truc que je fais
pour la police après une longue carrière.
Bon, à la prochaine, Tignasse.
Ali, c'est lequel ?
Celui avec le short blanc.
- Merde, il a l’air jeune.
- Il l’était. C'est le combat contre Patterson.
- Un vieux de la vieille.
- Qui, Patterson ? C'est une lavette.
- Ali lui fout une branlée.
- C'était un champion, lui aussi.
Un gars qui reste debout à la fin
d'un round, on le traite pas de lavette.
Ça marche comme ça, compris ?
On a trouvé ça chez Stringer.
Des papiers de son entreprise, de la fac,
des trucs concernant l’immobilier.
Pas de téléphone fixe, mais on a trouvé ça.
Des puces de portables. Une centaine.
C'est pour ça que notre gars
n'a pas réussi à lui en refiler.
Stringer avait un portable,
mais changeait de numéro sans arrêt.
Shamrock devait faire pareil
quand il appelait Bell.
Il était prudent.
- Oui et non.
- Regarde ça.
Tous de fournisseurs différents.
Merci.
Avant que Stringer Bell se fasse buter,
il a vendu son bon ami, Barksdale.
l’adresse d'une planque de Barksdale.
Où t'as déniché ça ?
Colvin.
- Ça vient de lui.
- Où est Daniels ?
Il a un truc en ville. Pour sa femme.
Faut qu'on fasse une descente.
Ça sera pas assez
pour le pincer pour Stringer.
On s'en contentera pour l’instant.
<i>Parce que ces quartiers
et les habitants de ce district</i>
<i>sont parmi les plus pauvres de la ville.</i>
<i>Et ce sont ces gens-là
qui ont besoin d’une voix forte à la mairie.</i>
<i>Il est temps qu’un changement ait lieu.</i>
<i>Et je crois pouvoir faire changer les choses</i>
<i>en représentant haut et fort
le nouveau 11e district</i>
<i>si vous me faites l’honneur de...</i>
C'est cool de voir la femme du lieutenant
se présenter.
<i>Comme vous venez de le voir,</i>
<i>la conseillère de l’ouest de la ville,
Eunetta Perkins,</i>
<i>a du souci à se faire pour les élections
qui auront lieu en septembre.</i>
Stringer Bell. Putain.
Qui a pu le buter ?
Je veux dire, puisque c'est pas toi.
Tu sais qu'Avon va croire que c'est toi.
Il a qu'à le croire. Je m'en tape.
On dirait
qu'il va y avoir de la bonne baston.
Tu l’as dit.
Il paraît que Colvin
est vraiment dans la merde.
À voir ce que je vois,
je dirais qu'il est peut-être pas le seul.
S'il y a du nouveau, contactez-moi.
Hé, mon pote.
Tu pourrais me filer 5 $ ?
J'en ai besoin pour prendre le bus.
- J'ai l’air d'un touriste ?
- Putain, je te jure.
On est au beau milieu
d'un marché de drogues,
et tu veux me faire croire
que c'est pour prendre le bus ?
J'ai déjà ma dose, mon pote.
T'as passé la nuit à boire comme un trou.
Tu devrais avoir honte.
Les balles utilisées courent pas les rues.
Mais c'est les mêmes que
pour le double meurtre à l’hippodrome.
Et je suis certain que cet enculé
a trempé là-dedans.
Et si je me souviens bien,
il n'aimait pas trop le gang de Barksdale.
Le genre exécution sommaire,
ça ressemble pas à Omar.
Et puis, les écoutes nous laissent à penser
que c'est plutôt le gang de Marlo.
- Marlo Stanfield ?
- L’héritier présomptif.
Les choses ne risquent pas de s'arranger.
On va dépasser de loin les 300 meurtres
avant le nouvel an.
On est vraiment dans la merde.
Salut, Cheryl.
Ah non ?
Elle doit sûrement interroger un prisonnier.
Oui, je lui ai parlé il y a 10 minutes.
Tu sais... On doit déposer tout notre bazar.
Portable, monnaie, arme.
Elle te rappellera
quand elle aura ton message.
De rien.
Il m'en faut plus, Jimmy.
Plus !
- Putain.
- Je suis fatigué, Bunk.
Allons-y.
On m'a dit qu'on avait discuté de mon cas.
Je vais passer
devant un comité de révision civil.
Ça n'a pas fait l’unanimité,
tu as été défendu.
Oui, il paraît.
Alors, six policiers noirs sur dix
pensent que je suis un connard de raciste.
D'un autre côté, quatre sur dix
pensent que tu es juste un connard.
Ça relève de l’administratif.
Tu peux te battre et gagner si tu le veux.
Manquement à s'identifier clairement
comme agent de police.
Ça pourrait résumer
toute ma carrière, en fait.
Je ne suis pas sûr
d'avoir pris la bonne voie.
Vraiment.
Et quelle autre voie aurais-tu dû prendre ?
Ça vient de l’indic du major Colvin ?
Quel est le lien ?
Son indic savait que Barksdale
avait un appart à son nom sur le port.
Ce sont les coordonnées qu'il a données
pour l’acte de transfert.
C'est bien,
mais il n'y a rien d'illégal là-dedans.
En quoi ça peut nous aider pour le pincer ?
Désolé pour le retard.
J'ai dû m'arrêter en route voir un ami.
La source savait que Barksdale
s'était pris une balle le mois dernier.
- Par les urgences ?
- Non, rien de ce genre-là.
Ce n'est pas suffisant.
Soit Colvin retourne voir son indic,
soit on reste sur cette adresse.
- On voit ce qu'on peut en tirer.
- Et puis merde.
Nommons la source dans la déclaration.
- C'est à Colvin d'en décider.
- C'était Bell.
Lester l’a découvert
en épluchant les appels.
Bell balançait des infos sur Barksdale.
- Vous êtes sûr ?
- Ça pourrait expliquer le meurtre.
Que donnent les écoutes ?
Des rumeurs disent que
c'est le gang de Marlo qui a fait le coup.
Bell étant mort,
Barksdale va peut-être devoir
se montrer plus présent
et entrer en contact avec certaines
petites frappes qu'on a sur écoute.
S'il est aussi prudent que Stringer,
c'est pas sûr.
À mon avis, Barksdale
ne touche jamais à un portable.
Je parie plutôt sur sa planque.
Bien.
On continue les écoutes de ces jetables
en espérant
qu'ils nous conduiront à Barksdale.
Pendant ce temps, on demande
un mandat pour sa planque et on l’attend.
Merci de m'avoir couverte hier soir.
RUSSELL "STRINGER" BELL
BPl# 64343 - ASSASSINÉ
Greggs, de l’unité spéciale.
Je peux parler à votre chef ?
Nom de Dieu.
<i>- Ils sont tous là.
- Bien.</i>
C'était l’hélico. Les journalistes
ont découvert notre petit merdier.
Enfin. Ce petit merdeux de conseiller
a pris son temps, non ?
Chacun ses détracteurs.
Si ça éclate,
dans quoi allez-vous vous reconvertir ?
Nous sommes dans l’ouest de Baltimore...
<i>Depuis plus d’un mois,
la police du district ouest de la ville...</i>
<i>C’est une véritable honte.</i>
<i>Je n’aurais jamais cru
que des gens au pouvoir puissent faire ça.</i>
<i>Honnêtement, voilà pourquoi
le maire ne peut plus rester en place.</i>
Le maire était-il au courant ? Et le préfet ?
C'est à eux qu'il faut le demander.
Criminalité, sécurité...
<i>Royce n’a plus aucune crédibilité.</i>
Vous allez toujours vous présenter ?
Oui, vu ce que je vois en ce moment...
<i>je ne peux pas faire autrement
que de vous le confirmer.</i>
<i>Tout ce que je sais,
c’est que depuis plus d’un mois,</i>
<i>la police de Baltimore a abandonné
des bouts</i>
<i>de district aux trafiquants
sans que le conseil en soit informé.</i>
Merde.
J'aurais pu être le premier à en parler
il y a une semaine.
<i>Depuis des semaines,
la police laisse faire...</i>
Putain, comment c'est possible ?
<i>... ce qui a donné lieu
à un grand trafic à ciel ouvert.</i>
<i>- Laissez-nous.
- La police...</i>
<i>... dans les "zones de non-droit’,
les dealers s’en donnent à cœur joie.</i>
M. Le maire, le préfet Burrell est là.
Dites-lui que le maire ne tardera pas
à le rejoindre.
<i>... et de jeunes enfants
sont livrés à eux-mêmes.</i>
Nouvelle choc - Trafic de drogue toléré
dans certaines zones - quartier ouest
<i>Les habitants
de ce qu’on a baptisé Hamsterdam</i>
<i>ne désirent pas s’exprimer
devant nos caméras.</i>
<i>Mais Channel 5 a appris que la police...</i>
<i>- Oui ?
- Qu’est-ce que vous voyez ?</i>
Y a du passage,
mais rien qui ressemble à Barksdale.
<i>- Ici aussi, c’est calme.
- Bon.</i>
Faut jeter un œil derrière.
Notre ami Carcetti va gagner des points
avec tout ça.
Et vu comment c'est parti,
Gray va le suivre.
Gray va essayer
de m'en faire porter l’entière responsabilité.
On ne vous couvrira pas, Ervin.
Vous êtes le seul responsable.
Pas forcément.
Pas si je parle des pressions exercées
pour faire baisser la criminalité.
- Pour faire mentir les statistiques.
- On n'a jamais dit ça.
De la façon dont Colvin,
sous la pression, s'est égaré.
- De ma venue ici, il y a des semaines...
- Des jours.
Des semaines, pour vous informer
de ses agissements et vous assurer
qu'on maîtrisait la situation,
que Colvin serait relevé
et son projet, abandonné.
Espèce de sale menteur.
Quand vous avez entendu parler
des bons résultats de Colvin,
vous m'avez envoyé balader.
C'est moi qui ai amené vos samaritains
de gauche à prendre la situation au sérieux
pendant que l’erreur de Colvin
prenait de l’ampleur.
J'avais les mains liées, M. Le maire.
Mon service était grandement contrarié.
J'étais le prisonnier de foutus politiciens.
Ou...
Je quitte votre bureau maintenant
en étant beaucoup plus silencieux.
Je fais retomber au maximum la faute
sur ce taré de Bunny Colvin.
Et je prends la responsabilité de cet échec.
Et si Carcetti ou Gray exige une audience,
je ferai tout
pour que vous ne soyez pas éclaboussé.
Auquel cas,
je serai le préfet
pendant les cinq ans de votre mandat.
- Unité un à unité deux.
- Unité deux, prête à intervenir.
L’accord a été passé.
Unité deux au secteur trois,
rendez-vous à la cité Winchester.
<i>Bien reçu. On y va.</i>
Unité deux au secteur deux,
rendez-vous aux entrepôts.
<i>Bien reçu.</i>
On fait ça en grand, messieurs.
Pas trop tôt.
Yo, mec.
On va être à sec si le matos n'arrive pas.
- Où est Tuckie ?
- J'en sais rien.
- Yo, il est où, Tuckie ?
- Il s'est barré.
- Quoi ?
- Les keufs arrivent.
Les voilà. On met les voiles.
Bouge pas, le sweat blanc !
Putain, lâchez-moi !
Arrête !
Bouge plus ! Reste là !
Plus un geste ! On ne bouge plus !
Bouge plus.
<i>Hallucinant, les rouges, hallucinant.
Ça mérite une caisse de bière.</i>
Je te jure, Stringer Bell était là,
à supplier qu'on le bute pas.
Vous me suivez ?
Il fouillait dans ses poches,
il disait qu'on aurait plein de flouze
si on le butait pas.
Mon pote, Chris, a beuglé:
"Salope, tu vas mourir."
Il est tombé à genoux
comme une vraie merde.
Il s'est mis à chialer.
Putain, pitoyable, une vraie lavette.
Il s'est mis à chialer.
Putain, pitoyable, une vraie lavette.
- C'est Marlo.
- Appelle, mon pote.
<i>- On sait où il est.
- Le numéro un ? Où ça ?</i>
<i>Apparemment, je dois te dire
où sont ses gars. Devant le garage.</i>
<i>D’accord, ça marche.</i>
Boss, ça va ?
- Quoi ?
- Slim dit qu'ils savent où est Marlo.
Et puis, tous les gars, ils t'attendent.
Vas-y. Je te suis.
Autre chose, M. Le préfet ?
Le maire veut
que tout soit rasé dans la nuit,
et interdisez-en l’accès.
La cité Winchester
et les entrepôts: Idem.
Compris.
Demain, les journalistes de la télé
n'auront plus d'arrière-plan intéressant.
Pardon, M. Le préfet,
on a trouvé un cadavre.
- Des blessures ?
- Dur à dire, les rats l’ont pas mal entamé.
Transportez-le à la morgue discrètement.
Je ne veux pas
que les journalistes voient une ambulance.
Putain !
Il vient d'arriver.
<i>Lui et un autre.</i>
- Compris. Ne bougez pas.
- On en est à combien ?
Barksdale compris,
Sydnor en a vu 10 entrer et aucun ressortir,
donc ça en fait au moins 10.
<i>- 2301 à central.
- Je vous écoute, 2301.</i>
Envoyez une équipe d'intervention rapide
nous rejoindre pour une arrestation.
Nombreux suspects sur les lieux
sûrement armés d'automatiques.
<i>Bien reçu.</i>
- Les nouvelles vont vite, pas vrai ?
- Et comment !
Burrell a appelé l’université en personne
ce matin.
Il a traîné votre nom dans la boue.
Nous n'avons pas besoin de ça.
Le doyen d'une université
reconnue pour son travail de recherche
ne veut pas entendre qu'un nouvel employé
n'en fait qu'à sa tête.
<i>- Oui, Colvin.
- Major, c’est pour demain matin.</i>
Les statistiques, demain.
Ça va être ma fête.
- On entre tous ensemble ?
- Où sont les renforts ?
- J'ai demandé une équipe.
- Vous n'êtes pas au courant ?
Lls sont un peu occupés ce soir,
avec le merdier de Bunny Colvin.
Avec tout ce bordel,
estimez-vous heureux qu'on soit là.
- À qui on s'attaque ?
- Avon Barksdale et son gang.
Je savais bien qu'il était sorti.
Je te l’avais pas dit ?
Bordel, je lui avais dit.
<i>Depuis plus de quatre semaines,
la police de Baltimore</i>
<i>a abandonné des bouts de district
aux trafiquants.</i>
Demain, tout le pays sera au courant
et Washington réagira.
Laisse Tony Gray
poser les meilleures questions.
Il a besoin de briller plus que toi.
Royce faisait-il pression sur la police
pour réduire le taux de criminalité
avant la fin de l’année
- Je rêve, il faut qu'on frappe.
- Dur de jeter une arme dans les chiottes.
Et s'ils ouvrent le feu sur nous ?
Lls sont en guerre contre un autre gang.
Si on charge,
y a des chances qu'ils nous flinguent.
Hé, B.
Sham dit que Charles dit
qu'ils ont pas bougé.
Marlo, Chris et Vinson,
ils sont toujours au même endroit.
Mais les autres se sont barrés.
Non.
- Pas sur la police.
- Les stups sont derrière.
Merde.
Ouvrez. On sait que vous êtes là.
Merde.
- Ouvrez, bande de gros nazes !
- On est de la baise.
Ils vont nous dire que
des gars comme nous devraient pas traîner
avec toutes ces armes dans le coin...
Ouvre-leur.
Allez, Avon. Arrête tes conneries.
Ouvre cette putain de porte.
Ouvrez cette foutue porte,
bande de connards !
- Police !
- Police ! Police !
- À terre !
- On a un mandat !
- J'ai rien fait.
- À terre !
- Serre bien les menottes.
- C'est Greggs, j'ouvre.
C'est à moi. En fait, tout est à moi.
T'as un diplôme de droit ?
Emmenez-le.
Violation de liberté conditionnelle.
Quoi qu'il arrive,
tu vas finir ta peine de sept ans
sans passer devant un jury.
Plus peut-être complot pour meurtre.
On va voir si tu peux pas prendre
de 10 ans à la prison à vie.
- Sans liberté conditionnelle.
- Ouais.
Y a que deux jours qui comptent.
Le jour où on t'enferme...
Et le jour où on te relâche.
C'est ça, mais voilà le mandat d'arrêt.
Prends ton temps pour le lire.
Entre ces deux jours,
ça te laissera de quoi penser.
Source: Russell Bell, alias Stringer Bell.
Merde. C'est foutu, maintenant.
Démarre.
Vous vous pliez à notre volonté
ou je passerai le restant de ma carrière
à faire chier tous les gars de votre district.
Des plus haut gradés au simple flic, pas un
ne pourra avoir de l’avancement
si on vous entend moufter.
Écoutez, mes hommes
n'ont fait qu'obéir à mes ordres !
- Le seul responsable, c'est moi !
- Mais vous ne serez pas le seul à tomber,
à moins d'accepter
ce que l’on vous propose.
Après les statistiques,
on va revoir votre dossier.
Vous aurez une retraite de lieutenant.
Eh oui, on vous rétrograde.
Vous gardez votre ancienneté,
mais oubliez la retraite de major.
Je peux prendre ma retraite
dès maintenant !
- J'ai encore des congés à prendre !
- Faites une croix là-dessus.
Vous dégagez aujourd'hui
en étant rétrogradé !
Ce n'est pas permis par la loi !
Je n'ai pas été assez clair ou quoi ?
- Avon s'est fait coffrer ?
- Avec la plupart de son gang, ouais.
C'est le bon moment
pour reprendre les affaires.
- Faire du flouze.
- Tu l’as dit.
Je ne parle pas
que des 17 millions fédéraux
que le maintien de l’ordre de Baltimore
a perdus.
Retranchez aussi 200 millions
de votre budget d'exploitation.
Et 75 millions de plus
de dépenses d'investissement,
plus quelques millions fédéraux
qui ne viendront plus d'Annapolis.
En tout, on parle
d'un demi-milliard par an en moins
dans votre budget.
De plus, le ministre de la Justice ici présent
fera tout
pour que ses employés
interdisent toute tentative
d'établissement d'un périmètre
où la vente de drogue serait légale.
Washington devrait savoir
que ce qui vient de se produire
ne reflète en rien
la politique de mon administration.
Il s'agit d'un moment d'égarement
de l’un de nos majors mal avisé.
Nous comprenons vos inquiétudes,
mais que le roi de la lutte anti-drogue
prenne le temps de faire 50 km plus au nord
pour me délivrer ce message,
pas trop nécessaire.
Ne vous en faites pas.
Alors, bandit ? Où sont les plus grands ?
Marlo a repris les affaires dans la rue.
Virez Burrell. Tout ça a commencé
dans sa cuisine sans qu'il le sache !
- Virez-le et allez de l’avant.
- Odell.
Je respecte votre opinion,
mais à l’heure où on se parle,
avec Tony Gray et Carcetti
qui complotent, ce n'est pas le moment.
Non. On laisse passer les primaires,
et je lui enfonce un pieu dans le cœur.
Mais pour l’heure,
j'ai besoin de lui pour ne serait-ce,
eh bien, qu'endosser la responsabilité
de tout ça, mais voilà ce que je vais faire.
Je vais être gentil
avec la nouvelle qui vous plaît.
Oui.
Je vais la prendre avec moi. Mettre Eunetta
au rancart. C'est fini pour elle.
Je respecte le fait
que vous m'ayez soutenu, Odell.
Je respecte la loyauté.
<i>... et a agi ainsi sans en informer
correctement ses supérieurs</i>
<i>et au mépris du code pénal
qu’il devait faire respecter,</i>
<i>se déshonorant ainsi lui-même
ainsi que sa fonction.</i>
Y voyez-vous à redire
ou avez-vous des objections,
major Colvin ?
<i>- Non, M. Le préfet de police.
- Rien du tout ?</i>
<i>Pas grand-chose à dire, hein ?
Pas à de vrais policiers.</i>
<i>- Qu’on en finisse, bande d’enc...
- Pardon, major ?</i>
Le lieutenant administratif est présent ?
Le major Colvin est relevé de ses fonctions.
Vous êtes à présent le commandant
par intérim du district de l’ouest.
Bon sang, Bernard,
je t'avais pas dit de te méfier d'eux ?
- Salut, Bunk.
- Salut, Freamon.
- C'est celle de qui, Crutchfield ?
- Norris. Je l’ai chopé en train de pioncer.
Oui, c'est tous ceux qui étaient sur écoute.
Oui, c'est tous ceux qui étaient sur écoute.
McNulty est dans la une avec Pearlman.
Va leur dire bonjour !
Oui.
Je suis jamais sortie avec un gars
plus con que toi.
Vivement la taule.
Quoi ? Qu'est-ce que t'as dit ?
Putain, qu'est-ce que t'as dit, Bernard ?
Salut, Donald.
On t'a fait écouter.
Il est venu me dire
qu'on pouvait dealer sur Vincent Street.
Alors on y est allés.
Et vous savez pourquoi.
C'est vous qui m'avez pris avec le matos
en route et laissé y aller, pas vrai ?
Tu dealais dans la zone de non-droit
du major Colvin ?
- Tu peux le prouver ?
- Demandez-lui. Il le sait.
Ça doit être un de vos trucs incitants.
- Une incitation, tu veux dire ?
- Il n'a pas tort.
Dix-neuf membres
du gang de Barksdale arrêtés,
huit autres sous mandat d'arrêt.
Vous pourriez lier ces arrestations
au merdier de Colvin ?
Faire comme si ça vous avait permis
d'y arriver ?
Je ne vois pas comment.
Enfin, beau travail quand même,
major Daniels.
Je viens de recevoir un appel de la mairie
approuvant votre promotion.
Et avec le départ de Colvin,
il y a un poste de libre.
- Et ma femme ?
- Oui, quoi ?
Le maire. Le siège d'Eunetta.
- Pourquoi le maire...
- Vous remercier, peut-être.
Tout n'est pas que politique.
- Hé, je te prends deux canettes.
- Ça marche.
Major.
On m'a mis au courant.
Comment le prend votre famille ?
Lolita a perdu plus de 13 kg, elle a eu
son permis pour vendre dans l’immobilier,
elle va peut-être me lourder.
Je voulais vous dire
que votre tuyau nous a beaucoup aidés.
Oui, il paraît. Beau boulot.
Si vous ne le saviez pas,
Stringer Bell a été assassiné
il y a deux jours.
Bref, j'ai mentionné son nom
pour être sûr de boucler l’affaire.
C'est vrai, quoi. Vu qu'il avait été refroidi.
On aime bien
passer par-dessus la hiérarchie.
J'ai l’impression
que je ne suis pas le seul, major.
- Quoi qu'il arrive, vous êtes un bon flic.
- J'ai fait ce que j'ai fait.
Je croyais bien faire.
J'assume.
Tony, où est mon gilet pare-balles ?
- Merci.
- Merci.
Je ne comprends pas.
Bois ton verre de vin.
Toi et moi, en public.
- Mais ta femme...
- Elle est gagnante sans moi.
- Dans l’équipe du maire, elle gagne.
- Et tu es promu major ?
Je crois qu'elle attendait ce jour
plus que moi.
Et à présent, elle n'est pas là.
Non. En effet.
De nulle part, hein ?
Nulle part, ça me va.
Pourquoi moi ?
Sûrement parce que tu mènes
une mauvaise vie.
- Kari, c'était quoi, ce bruit ?
- Rien.
- Qu'est-ce que tu as cassé ?
- Rien, maman.
- Alors...
- Oui.
- Tu as décidé de passer par ici.
- Oui.
Pourquoi ce soir ? Que s'est-il passé ?
Je suis passé dans mon ancien district,
j'aimais bien travailler là-bas.
J'étais moins enragé, en tout cas.
J'en sais rien, quelqu'un a dit un truc
et je crois...
Ça n'a pas de sens.
- J'ai bouclé un truc aujourd'hui.
- Une affaire ?
Plus que ça.
C'est comme si je m'acharnais
à remplir un verre sans fond.
Je verse, je verse, mais le verre
reste toujours vide, tu comprends ?
Ce qui fait de moi un bon inspecteur,
c'est peut-être ça qui fait de moi
un minable dans la vie.
Tu veux entrer prendre un verre ?
Pas ce soir.
Mais si c'est pas trop tard,
j'aimerais bien rencontrer tes enfants.
<i>Le major Colvin
a induit en erreur ses hommes.</i>
<i>Ils pensaient qu’il s’agissait
d’un déploiement stratégique</i>
<i>pour piéger des trafiquants de drogue.</i>
<i>Il n’a jamais fait mention</i>
<i>de son initiative à ses supérieurs.</i>
<i>Et pendant cinq semaines,</i>
<i>aucun supérieur ne lui a demandé
de rapporter ses agissements ?</i>
<i>Vous plaisantez ?</i>
<i>J’en assume l’entière responsabilité,
et bien sûr,</i>
<i>quand j’ai été mis au courant,
j’en ai informé le maire</i>
<i>et ensemble, nous avons pris la décision</i>
<i>de relever le major Colvin de ses fonctions
sur-le-champ.</i>
<i>J’ai l’impression</i>
<i>que cette administration
a réellement considéré</i>
<i>- d’appuyer l’initiative de Colvin.
- C’est faux.</i>
<i>Le major Colvin vous en a informé
à une réunion de service</i>
<i>il y a plus d’une semaine.</i>
<i>Il s’est passé six jours
sans que rien ne bouge.</i>
<i>Et j’en prends la responsabilité.</i>
<i>Nous devions boucler
une enquête en cours conduite</i>
<i>par l’unité spéciale.</i>
<i>Une affaire liée à des écoutes
qui nécessitait d’agir.</i>
<i>C’est exact, le maire Royce était au courant</i>
<i>et nous a autorisés
à boucler d’abord cette affaire.</i>
<i>Mais le maire a été très clair,</i>
<i>il était férocement
contre les agissements du major Colvin.</i>
<i>Ce que nous avons là, je le crains,
c’est simplement</i>
<i>un chef de police qui a agi seul et qui,
sous la pression, s’est montré amoral,</i>
<i>incompétent et inapte à remplir sa fonction.</i>
<i>Non. Le problème
est bien plus vaste que cela.</i>
<i>Ce qui est plus important que de découvrir
qui savait quoi quand, qui tombera,</i>
<i>ou qui pourra utiliser ce désastre
pour le bienfait de sa carrière.</i>
<i>- M. Le présid...
- On peut pardonner au major Colvin</i>
<i>qui, frustré, désespéré,</i>
<i>a fini par trouver tolérable
une situation pour le moins intolérable.</i>
<i>Ça, c’est excusable.</i>
<i>Mais, messieurs, ce qui est impardonnable,</i>
<i>ce que je ne pourrai jamais pardonner,
c’est comment nous,</i>
<i>vous, moi, cette administration, nous tous,</i>
<i>comment nous avons délaissé
ces rues de la ville,</i>
<i>là où les pauvres, les indigents,
les sous-prolétaires sont piégés</i>
<i>dans des quartiers en ruines
autrefois si chers à leur cœur.</i>
<i>Des communautés
que nous n’avons pas su protéger</i>
<i>et que nous avons abandonnées
aux mains des trafiquants de drogue.</i>
<i>Et si cette expérience désastreuse
exige une réponse de la ville,</i>
<i>cette réponse doit être: "Assez".</i>
<i>Ne laissons plus des policiers
penser qu’il n’y a plus d’espoir.</i>
<i>Cessons de penser
que ces quartiers sont perdus</i>
<i>et qu’on ne peut rien faire.</i>
<i>Il faut que cette administration
prenne des décisions, sorte de sa léthargie.</i>
<i>Du ramassage des ordures
aux habitations qui restent vides,</i>
<i>aux drogués qu’on laisse s’enfoncer,</i>
<i>aux travailleurs qu’on prive,
chaque jour, de s’en sortir.</i>
<i>Enrayons la criminalité
qui rend de plus en plus</i>
<i>la vie dans notre ville insupportable.</i>
<i>Parce que si nous ne prenons pas
nos responsabilités,</i>
<i>pas seulement
en reconnaissant nos erreurs,</i>
<i>mais en nous battant
pour reprendre le contrôle de ces rues,</i>
<i>si cela ne se produit pas,</i>
<i>nous perdrons d’abord ces quartiers
pour finir par perdre la ville à jamais.</i>
<i>Sans le courage
et la conviction nécessaires</i>
<i>pour mener ce combat à bien,</i>
<i>comme il le faut, en utilisant
toutes les armes que l’on peut rassembler,</i>
<i>si nous ne le faisons pas,</i>
<i>alors le constat d’échec sera accablant.</i>
<i>Et cet échec ne peut pas, ne sera pas
et ne doit pas être excusable.</i>
Vous nous avez permis de boucler l’affaire,
je ne le nierai pas.
Mais j'ai besoin que la confiance règne.
À moins que vous ne me donniez
votre parole, je ne peux pas...
Je l’ai bien mérité. Merci.
Je crois qu'il vaut mieux
que je fasse autre chose.
Inspecteur.
Ce n'est pas vous, c'est moi.
- Mais où...
- Je retourne dans mon district.
Je m'y sens comme chez moi.
- Bon discours.
- Je pense qu'il fallait que ce soit dit.
Ça ressemblait à un discours électoral.
Eunetta. Ça faisait longtemps.
Je croyais que tu prenais ça au sérieux.
À quelle heure on se pointe demain ?
15 h 30, ce serait bien.
- Je vous attends, alors.
- Ça marche.
Qu'est-ce que vous attendez, bordel ?
Au boulot.
<i>... à la fausse promesse que nos écoles
offrent un avenir à nos enfants.</i>
DÉPISTAGE DU VIH
Voilà. C'est ça.
Oui.

CARCETTI
MAIRE
Accusation de Malik Carr, alias "Poot’,
Herbert DeRodd Johnson, alias "Puddin’',
Arthur Carroll...
Qu'est-ce que tu vois, là ?
C'est du métal en vrac, 10 cents la livre.
Regarde.
- De l’aluminium.
- Gagné.
Trente cents la livre. Sûr.
Tu vois, dans ces temps modernes,
faut savoir regarder par terre
et ramasser ce qui traîne.
Y a du flouze à se faire
si tu sais où regarder.
Écoute bien,
j'essaie de t'apprendre un truc.
Ouais, tu t'en fous.
Tu crois tout savoir, pas vrai ?
Ça va ?
C'est quelque chose, hein ?
Une gomme géante qui a tout effacé.
Oui.
Oui, mais avant, quand un junkie venait ici
s'acheter sa dose, personne le faisait chier.
Ni les dealers, ni la police, il avait la paix.
C'était bien ?
Je dis ça comme ça.
Vous le savez peut-être pas,
mais on a la vie dure.
Les flics qui vous tabassent,
les dealers qui vous cherchent.
Oui, merci.
Putain.
Dix cents. C'est un début.
Allez, mon gars.
Un vendeur est demandé
au rayon plomberie.
La vache !
Vous regardez le DeWalt sans fil.
Ce pistolet à clou.
Le DeWalt 410.
Oui, le problème,
c'est que si on le laisse
dans le fourgon,
quand on a besoin de s'en servir,
la batterie tient pas le coup.
Oui, ça arrive avec les sans fil.
Vous devriez prendre
le cloueur à poudre.
Le Hilti DX 460 MX
ou le Simpson PTP...
Ce sont mes bijoux.
Tout le reste est
d'une qualité discutable.
Vous bossez sur un chantier
ou vous faites des travaux chez vous ?
- On travaille un peu partout.
- À temps plein ?
Non. On a eu cinq boulots
le mois dernier.
Avec cette activité,
le coût des cloueurs à poudre
se justifie.
- "À poutre" ?
- À poudre.
Comme de la poudre à canon ?
Le DX 460 est automatique,
avec un calibre de charge de 27.
Le bois, le ciment, l'acier...
Cette machine peut clouer
n'importe quoi. Et pour son prix,
le recul est meilleur que
sur le Simpson ou le P3500.
Vous comprenez ce que c'est
que le recul ?
Vous voulez dire le contrecoup.
Je pige.
- Tout à fait.
- Calibre de 27, hein ?
Pas énorme du point
de vue balistique,
mais pour enfoncer des clous,
c'est suffisant.
Avec un plus gros calibre,
le recul serait plus important.
J'ai déjà vu un petit 22
étaler un mec, bien des fois.
Ces saloperies rentrent
comme dans du beurre,
et vous éclate la gueule.
Mais les grosses articulations...
Si vous êtes charpenté,
ça vous brise les os,
et vous vous dites : "Eh merde !"
Je vais prendre celui-ci.
C'est combien ?
669 $ plus la TVA.
Non, vous pouvez payer à la caisse.
Non, occupez-vous de ça pour moi.
Gardez le reste.
- C'est 800 $.
- Et alors ?
Vous avez bien gagné votre pognon.
Gardez-le.
C'est bon ?
Le type a dit que si on veut clouer,
c'est le bijou des cloueurs.
Il voulait dire "diamant",
mais il le savait pas.
- Il se rechargera mieux ?
- Oublie ça.
C'est un cloueur à poudre de 27,
automatique, pas de recul.
C'est le paradis du clou.
C'est de la marchandise d'enfer.
Plus besoin de clouer les planches,
on peut tuer quelques enfoirés
avec ce truc.
Tu rigoles, mais on me l'a dit.
J'essaie de t'expliquer.
C'est vrai.
SUR ÉCOUTE
"Pour l'abattoir, c'est par ici".
On en a sept jusque-là.
Tous mis sur écoute.
On les a pas tous,
mais ça ne saurait tarder.
- Ils jettent pas leur téléphones ?
- Un peu tous les mois.
Mais on devrait pouvoir
associer un téléphone ou deux
à Marlo ou à ses proches.
S'ils utilisent encore des portables
de nos jours, je les tiens.
Si Marlo Stanfield a un portable,
- je l'aurai aussi.
- Lester, le pro du portable.
Je dis pas de bêtises.
C'est un fait.
Marlo Stanfield a peut-être
beaucoup de ressources,
mais il touche pas une bille
dans ce domaine-là.
J'étais fier de traquer les Barksdale,
mais ce gamin, Stanfield...
Il est pas aussi mauvais qu'on pensait.
On ne peut lui attribuer aucun meurtre
depuis des mois.
Vous semblez déçus.
Cette unité a besoin de cibles difficiles,
ou on servira plus à rien.
Peut-être bien.
Je présume que vous voulez
- encore 30 jours d'écoute.
- Au moins.
On a aussi des assignations
à envoyer cette semaine.
- Des assignations ?
- Des enquêtes de biens.
- Pour Marlo Stanfield ?
- Venez.
Tout ça vient de la traque
de l'argent des Barksdale.
On a vérifié tout ce qu'on a
trouvé dans l'appart de Stringer
et dans le bureau en ville.
- Prez me manque.
- Je sais bien.
Ces types avaient de l'argent partout.
Des investissements, des contributions
politiques, frais de consultation...
Vous voulez faire ça maintenant ?
Je voulais le faire il y a un an,
mais des affaires plus urgentes
m'en ont empêché.
Et votre inspecteur va approuver ?
Notre inspecteur est
sans peur et sans reproches.
Voilà de quoi commencer.
Attendez.
Mes bons de réduction.
Tu allais donner
mes bons de réduction à cette dame.
Je les découpe depuis deux jours.
Tu me les as presque perdus.
Pourquoi sont-ils sur ma pile ?
Pourquoi ta pile est-elle
dans mon espace de travail ?
Parce que je me tape le boulot !
Tu me tapes sur les nerfs, oui.
Quatre semaines avant
les primaires de Baltimore,
vous me filez une pile d'assignations
liées à l'argent de la drogue
qui impliquent une dizaine
d'hommes politiques importants.
Il y a une élection ?
Qui se présente ?
Ils ne m'en croient pas capable.
On ne peut pas se retaper
quatre ans de plus avec ce type.
La ville est en piteux état.
C'est ce qu'on a dit aussi
pendant mon terme.
Tu avais une mauvaise
main dès le départ.
Avec les émeutes et tout.
Je crois que je peux m'en sortir
si Tony Gray prend
25 ou 26 % des votes,
car ça viendrait des supporters
de Royce.
25 % , c'est pas mal pour Gray, non ?
Il y a de plus en plus de sondages
négatifs sur Royce,
même parmi les électeurs noirs.
Dans une minute, Norman.
Tu veux mon avis, Tommy ?
Quoi qu'il en soit,
ton nom a été annoncé,
et ça t'aidera plus tard,
si tu veux monter
dans le législatif un jour.
Mais entre compatriotes,
il n'y aura plus de maires blancs
dans cette ville.
Excusez-moi, Votre Éminence.
Tu es censé être à la maison
de retraite Baylor-Edison
et je ne préférerais pas mentir
à une salle d'électeurs ridés
parce que tu voulais parler boutique
toute la matinée.
Des personnes âgées ?
Ils votent, Tommy.
Faut que j'y aille.
C'est vous qui gérez le temps
du candidat. Qu'il ne l'oublie pas.
C'est exact.
Il me faut votre signature
sur les registres de véhicule,
un rapport du tribunal corrigé,
des demandes d'assignations
et une réquisition à la commune
pour un gros ventilateur.
Un ventilateur ?
Caroline dit qu'il fait chaud
dans la salle d'écoute,
avec la porte fermée.
Superbe, inspecteur.
- Superbe maison sur la plage.
- Vous trouvez ?
Ça me fait penser à la retraite
et je ne bosse que depuis neuf ans.
Quand commencez-vous les travaux ?
En mars prochain,
si j'ai tous les permis de construire...
D'ailleurs, mardi,
- je serai dans le Delaware pour ça.
- Pas de problème.
Lester et moi, on s'occupe de tout.
Aucun problème.
DEMANDE D'ASSIGNATION
Du gâteau.
Tu vois ?
On parle de la mère de mon bébé, là.
Mais vous avez cassé, non ?
Je vis pas avec elle,
mais je lui file quand même
un peu de fric,
comme ça, de temps en temps.
Pandémie !
Regarde ça.
Nay.
Namond ?
Je te paye pour quoi faire, négro?
Désolé, B.
Bon sang !
Oublie la queue de cheval.
Les flics vont le repérer de loin.
Fais-toi une tresse !
Moi et Patrice, on est ensemble
depuis longtemps.
Ouais, mais tu dis qu'elle sort
avec Fruit maintenant.
Ouais. S'il la met pas en veilleuse,
je vais lui trouer le cul.
Tu me crois pas ?
J'ai la pandémie.
Fais ce que tu veux.
- Bodie.
- Salut.
Tu nous as fait marcher
toute la semaine.
Il vient, ce paquet, ou quoi ?
Les affaires stagnent.
Elles stagnent depuis
qu'on a quitté Fayette Street.
Marlo voulait Fayette.
J'aime pas céder, mec.
Je passe pour un crétin.
J'ai envie de rien faire.
C'est plus comme avant.
Le maire Barksdale est parti.
T'es tout seul.
À plus.
On y va.
Lex,
je vais te dire la vérité,
parce que tu en as besoin.
Ce type, Marlo, il tient le monde
par les couilles.
Et Fruit, il bosse pour Marlo.
Alors je te le dis, oublie cette salope.
Passe à autre chose.
C'est comme ça.
C'est comme ça.
Un instant, madame.
Vous avez vu Hoskins ?
L'inspecteur est déjà monté.
Avancez, s'il vous plaît.
Madame la présidente.
La présidente du conseil
est bien gaulée.
Je te baiserais
pour pouvoir la baiser.
Tu baiserais un mec
pour pouvoir baiser une bombe ?
Tu te sens pas un peu pédale ?
C'est une expression.
T'es dans ce détachement
depuis longtemps ?
Huit mois.
Huit mois avec Clarence Royce.
Je peux te demander :
t'es prêt à prendre une balle
pour le maire de Baltimore ?
Le camion, ça ira
ou il faut en appeler un autre ?
Non, ça ira.
Il n'a besoin que de 10 minutes.
Pas maintenant.
Peut-être demain.
C'est encore Krawczyk ?
À chaque fois qu'il fait un chèque,
il vient demander quelque chose,
juste pour savoir qu'il le peut.
On a des appels de l'équipe
de Carcetti aussi.
Ils veulent un débat
sur le crime et la sécurité,
et un sur les sujets économiques
et les écoles.
Tony Gray a toujours le même refrain.
Comme s'ils allaient avoir
une soirée entière
pour m'aligner avec le crime.
J'ai dit au journal "The Sun"
qu'on était prêts à tout format,
ce qui sera le cas
pendant quelques jours.
Puis on leur dira : "Allez vous
faire foutre. Un seul débat".
Deux débats. Et puis quoi encore ?
Cet enfoiré du golf
et du gazon vert, Carcetti.
Il va devoir s'habituer à la vie
dans la jungle.
...pas seulement en ville,
mais dans les quartiers de l'est aussi.
Nous triompherons
ou tomberons ensemble.
Je suis ici pour vous demander
une chance de triompher ensemble.
Merci pour votre temps.
Des questions ?
On aura du steak
pour le déjeuner aujourd'hui,
ou bien des tacos ?
Ce sont des développements
comme celui-ci,
des tours résidentielles
avec des commerçants
et restaurants sur les quais,
qui vont faire rentrer plus d'impôts
pour reconstruire notre ville.
Je voudrais remercier Ed Bowers
pour sa vision,
mais surtout, pour son dévouement.
Son dévouement
envers la ville de Baltimore.
M. le maire,
je voudrais vous remercier,
ainsi que votre administration,
d'avoir rendu possible cette nouvelle
étape de redéveloppement
du port de Baltimore.
Quand on parle de vision
et de dévouement...
on pense à notre maire,
Clarence Royce.
Quoi de neuf, Nay ?
- C'est quoi ?
- Rien.
C'est un article sur A.J.
de North & Woods.
Ils l'ont condamné à 700 ans.
Lis ça.
C'est mort, ici.
- Tu bosses encore ?
- On allait aller sous la route
- pour attraper des oiseaux.
- J'en sais rien.
Je vais voir si je peux me tirer.
Quoi ?
Je pourrais partir plus tôt ?
Moi et mes potes, on voulait aller
à Mondawmin
pour acheter des affaires d'école.
Pourquoi t'as besoin
d'affaires d'école ?
T'es toujours exclu.
Allez, arrête, B.
Si y'avait pas
de promotion sociale,
tu serais encore
en maternelle, enfoiré.
À la crèche même.
Et puis merde.
Paie cinq heures à ce nègre qui arrive
en retard et se tire en avance.
Tu me dois des heures sup demain.
Lex ! Tu m'as entendu ?
Putain !
Y'a plus d'éthique professionnelle
de nos jours.
Je le garde à cause de son père.
Viens tôt demain.
Ça sera pas toujours aussi calme.
Enfin, j'espère.
M. le maire.
Je voulais m'assurer
qu'on est toujours bons
pour le terre-plein
sur Boston Street.
Il me faut l'accès
pour rendre le site viable.
J'en parlerai à mon équipe.
Y'a un problème
avec son terre-plein ?
Pas une fois qu'il aura payé.
Je crois qu'il peut faire
mieux que 4 000,
non ?
Je ne veux pas le savoir.
Chris, je t'en supplie.
On n'a plus beaucoup de chaux vive.
C'est pas grave.
Y'a personne des deux côtés.
Il va puer, c'est tout.
Chris, je t'en prie.
T'inquiète, mec.
Je vais faire ça bien.
Ce sera rapide, je te le promets.
Des trucs comme ça, ça n'arrive
même pas dans les dessins animés.
Le coucou attrape la graine
et se tire.
- On n'est pas dans un dessin animé.
- Toi, oui.
Tais-toi.
Tu fais peur aux oiseaux.
Je vous parle à tous les deux.
Tu m'as fait quitter le taf
pour ces conneries ?
- Ça va pas ou quoi ?
- On est sérieux, Nay.
- L'oiseau peut valoir 300 ou 400.
- Arrête.
Tu sais, Nemo, qui s'occupait
de la cage à pigeons de Marlo ?
Il a dit qu'il avait eu 400
pour un pigeon voyageur blanc.
- Et ça, c'est un voyageur ?
- Il est blanc.
- Ça en fait un pigeon voyageur ?
- Peut-être.
Faut que tu foutes de la viande
dans ce piège.
Tu l'aurais déjà.
Si tu avais fermé ta gueule,
je l'aurais déjà.
Je vais exploser ce connard !
C'est quoi, ton problème ?
Tu lances des bouteilles, hein ?
- On a perdu du blé à cause de toi.
- J'ai rien fait.
T'es vraiment débile.
Tu joues avec des insectes
comme si tu portais des Pampers.
C'était pas nécessaire.
Me parle pas de Pampers.
Je les collerais sur ta grande gueule,
pour attraper toute la merde
qui en sort.
Et toi, tu pues
comme un pet de rat.
Voilà !
Vous vous comportez
comme des nanas.
T'as vu Duke ?
Il l'a assommé.
Je voulais pas trop m'approcher
et toucher ce sale enfoiré.
J'aurais pu attraper le sida
ou un truc comme ça.
Dukie se bat comme une gonzesse.
Je lui aurais cassé la gueule
si j'avais pas eu pitié de lui.
Duke, tu as fait peur aux oiseaux.
J'ai fait une bombe à insectes.
Tu veux voir les morceaux ?
Non, faut que j'y aille.
C'était pas un pigeon voyageur.
Ils ont un truc en métal à une patte.
Comme ça, on peut
les différencier des autres.
- Comment tu le sais ?
- Nemo me laisse nettoyer sa cage.
Il me l'a appris.
Il nous en reste donc 54.
Pas de surprise. C'est les habitués.
On a perdu M. Parker et Mme Bowles.
- Gregory part ?
- Le comté l'a engagé.
Je savais que Bowles
ne reviendrait pas,
vu comme ils ont vandalisé
sa salle de classe.
Il nous en manque deux en maths
et quatre en sciences.
Un homme à la porte.
Il dit qu'il est nouveau.
Faites-le entrer
avant qu'il ne change d'avis.
Tout au fond à gauche.
Tirez fort.
- Plus fort !
- C'est fermé.
J'arrive.
Rien ne marche dans ce taudis.
Si vous regardez les affectations
à la cantine,
vous verrez que ça laissera Ernest seul
pour le deuxième cours.
Il ne peut pas s'en sortir tout seul.
Dites-leur, je vais même pas
essayer de le prononcer.
Roland Pryzbylewski.
On m'appelle "Prez".
Claudell Withers.
Je suis le principal.
Le nouveau prof de maths.
Je n'aurai pas mon diplôme
avant l'an prochain,
mais j'ai suivi
le programme de suppléant.
Ils m'ont dit que j'aurais des classes
à cause du manque de personnel.
Pour l'abattoir, c'est par ici.
Que faisiez-vous
avant de vouloir enseigner ?
J'étais policier de la ville.
Marcia Donnelly,
adjointe du principal.
Bienvenue au collège
Edward Tilghman.
Ça nous laisse Tullman pour le 12e.
Vous croyez qu'il s'en sortira
tout seul ?
C'est lequel, Tullman, déjà ?
Un rouquin.
Il ressemble à Poil de Carotte,
en moins féroce.
Jimmy, le commandant veut te voir.
Jimmy, entrez.
Je sais que je vous l'ai offert
quand je suis arrivé
et je sais quelle était votre réponse,
mais je vous le redemande.
Puis-je vous sortir de votre voiture ?
Non, merci, commandant.
McNulty, il me manque deux hommes
sur le terrain.
Mon escouade de secours
est incompétente.
Vous êtes trop bon
pour faire des patrouilles.
Merci pour votre offre.
Je lui ai demandé 10 fois quand
j'étais commandant suppléant.
Il est au mauvais endroit.
Pour nous.
Mais pour lui...
Et l'amitié, hein, Bodie ?
Et l'amitié, bordel !
On se connaît depuis un bail
avec ce gosse.
Je l'ai pourchassé
jusqu'en prison juvénile.
Mais est-ce que ça compte
maintenant ?
Il me fait à peine un sourire,
un signe de la main.
Rien.
Et "bonjour" ?
Tu vois, c'était pas si difficile.
Lex, comment
se passe ta journée ?
Je ne veux pas critiquer,
mais je crois que tu as loupé
un endroit.
Kevin, ça roule ?
Reesey, on dirait qu'on vient
de tuer ton chien.
Ça va, mec ?
Reesey se goure encore
sur les comptes ?
Tu as entendu ça ?
On va l'envoyer à Lamelle
le mois prochain.
Je suis sûr que Mme Davis
lui fera du soutien en maths.
On n'aura pas perdu notre journée.
Putain de flic.
Tout va bien ?
Oui, on parle.
M. Incitation au délit,
comment ça va ?
Fais pas cette tête.
Je fête encore cette histoire.
Tu sais comment il s'est sorti
de sa mise sur écoute il y a un an ?
Il a dit qu'on l'avait incité au délit
quand il bossait pour Bunny Colvin.
Je déconne pas.
Il est malin. J'ai adoré.
Quand je repasserai dans une heure,
ce coin a intérêt à être désert.
Ton équipe a fini sa journée.
Alors reprenons.
Je dis : "Bonne soirée, M. Broadus".
Bonne soirée à vous,
sergent Carver.
Tu vois ! On se comprend.
Et bonne soirée à vous,
M. l'agent Colicchio.
Va te faire enculer, fumier.
C'était quoi, ça ?
- Tu peux pas choper tout le monde.
- Ah non ?
Si tu chopes tout le monde, à qui
tu parles quand quelque chose arrive ?
- Tim, merci pour hier.
- Pas de problème.
Tu as eu du retard toute la matinée.
En retard pour les vieux,
pour le rendez-vous avec Stonewall.
En retard pour l'association
gay et lesbiennes.
Les vieux, ils parlent doucement.
Des conneries !
C'était le petit-déj' avec Tony,
à se raconter des histoires
en buvant du café froid.
- Tony ?
- Il me donnait des conseils...
- Un maire d'un seul terme ?
- C'était pas de sa faute.
Il a pris les rênes en 67,
a vu la ville brûler.
C'était une opportunité.
Spiro Agnew a construit sa carrière
sur les émeutes de 68.
Connard pour les uns,
vice-président pour les autres.
- C'est toujours vrai.
- C'est les sondages ?
Des premiers chiffres.
C'est incomplet.
Tu devrais être en train d'appeler
pour demander des dons.
Putain, j'en peux plus !
Je déteste ça plus que tout.
- Je déteste !
- Si tu ne le fais pas,
tu ne pourras pas te payer
les spots publicitaires
- des deux dernières semaines.
- Putain !
Je déteste ça.
Salut, Jim.
C'est Tom Carcetti,
tu te souviens de moi ?
On s'est rencontrés chez ta sœur...
Tu sais, celle qui est mariée
à ce fumier républicain.
Je sais que
tu te souviens pas de moi.
Je sais que tu te fous des politiques,
et franchement, je me contrefous
de ton opinion
ou de tes inquiétudes.
Mais j'aimerais savoir
ce que ta petite femme blonde
pense d'un tas de choses.
Jim, en fait, je t'appelle
parce que je veux que tu me fasses
un chèque de 4 000 $,
le maximum permis par la loi.
On doute que tu envoies
bel et bien le chèque,
alors on va t'envoyer
des techniciens au chômage
pour qu'ils te tabassent
et prennent ton argent.
Tu as fini ?
Il te faut 30 000 $
dans les trois prochaines heures.
Point barre.
Obtiens l'argent
ou meurs dans cette pièce.
N'importe quoi.
Qu'est-ce que tu regardes ?
Y'a quelque chose à la télé ?
Pas question.
Ils ont ce qu'il faut sur le terrain,
mais il leur faut un bon lanceur.
Qu'est-ce que tu regardes ?
Il est cinglé.
Comme si j'allais ramener l'enfoiré
à Woodlawn.
Au secours !
Ça va, Patrice ?
Tu laisses sonner, j'espère ?
Tu ne raccroches pas
après deux sonneries ?
Je passe les coups de fil, Terri.
Je sais pas quoi dire.
Ils sont pas chez eux.
30 000, Tommy.
Lex, celui qui sortait avec Patrice ?
Lester !
- C'est le père de son bébé.
- C'était pas une vierge.
Parle pas comme ça.
Ce connard s'est pointé
devant le Paragon et l'a descendu.
Dans la tête !
Merde, il était mignon.
Après Lex et son 9 mm,
il était moins mignon, l'enfoiré.
Et sur le téléphone de Fruit ?
Rien. J'étais sortie
depuis deux heures.
- Bien sûr.
- C'est pas un problème.
J'ai besoin de ton aide.
D'accord pour 4 000.
Et ta femme ?
Tu crois qu'elle donnerait 4 000 ?
- 8 000, on peut pas.
- Et les enfants ?
Ils sont encore en poussette.
- Je le sais bien. Je blaguais.
- Très drôle.
D'accord, 4 000, c'est bien.
- Merci.
- Pas de problème.
Une balle dans la tempe gauche.
De près dans le parking du club
plein de gens,
mais bien sûr, personne n'a rien vu.
Votre tueur s'appelle Lex.
On avait le portable de la victime
sur écoute aussi.
On va réécouter les appels,
on vous enverra ce qu'on trouve.
On a trouvé ça dans sa poche.
On peut en tirer des numéros,
c'est le prix de consolation.
Ça vous met dans la merde, de perdre
un mec que vous aviez sur écoute ?
Non, on a plusieurs téléphones
dans la rue.
Avec ou sans M. Fruit,
on arrivera à nos fins.
C'est étrange.
On ne voit pas de cadavres.
C'est le premier incident
depuis des mois,
et c'est le mec de Marlo qui tombe.
- Marlo n'est plus le nouveau caïd ?
- Si.
Il a tout, de MLK à Fulton.
Comment avoir autant de terrain
sans descendre des gens ?
Si tu entends autre chose
au sujet de ce meurtre, Lester,
Bunk attend ton appel.
Je le sais bien.
Au diable Norris.
C'est toi, mon partenaire, Lester.
Pour la vie.
Me taquine pas, cocotte.
Regarde-le marcher
avec ses jambes arquées.
C'est de ma faute.
Qui est Lex ?
Le cousin de Dontrelle.
Avant, il bossait pour Cantel.
Il bosse près de Hilltop maintenant.
Il est pas plus connecté que ça ?
Et il s'approche d'un de mes gars ?
C'était pas pour du business.
Pour de la chatte.
Fruit avait mis la main sur une nana
que Lex voulait se garder.
Si tu veux, on les descend tous
dans ce coin-là,
jusqu'au dernier salaud.
C'est quel coin, déjà ?
Rag-tag près de Pacer.
Ils ont leur marchandise par Joe,
mais sinon, ils sont indépendants.
On les explose, Marlo.
Y'a qu'à demander.
Tu veux tous les descendre, hein ?
Et leur prendre leur coin aussi.
Je m'en tape
d'avoir un coin pourri à Hilltop.
Et pourquoi je voudrais
empiler les corps
alors que personne
nous a déclaré la guerre ?
Juste Lex.
Il a tué un des nôtres,
il faut qu'il paye.
Sors de là, Tommy.
Debout !
Allez, joli cœur.
T'es pas obligé de rentrer chez toi,
mais tu resteras pas ici.
- Allez, on y va.
- On est chez moi ?
Voilà, c'est bien.
6:30 demain matin.
Me force pas à te tirer du lit
comme hier.
Qu'est-ce qui t'est arrivé ?
Les gars de Terrace
m'ont cassé la gueule.
Je traversais les rails,
près de Ramsey Street.
Teron, Manny, Herbie.
Tous des nègres de Terrace.
Ils peuvent pas s'en prendre
à Dukie.
Ouais, y'a que nous
qui pouvons te faire ça.
Il faut qu'on se venge.
Qu'on soit quittes.
Quittes ?
Je veux leur faire deux fois plus mal.
Leur filer une raclée
qu'ils sont pas près d'oublier.
Si on se bat avec eux,
ils seront autant que nous,
même plus nombreux.
Et alors ? T'as la trouille ?
Non. Si on veut leur faire mal,
il faut réfléchir.
Faire mieux que
leur casser la gueule.
Tu veux dire, avec des armes ?
Non, pas des armes.
Quoi ?
Merde.
Randy a une idée.
Tu sais ce que j'ai bouffé
pour dîner hier soir ?
Un sandwich au thon.
Je l'ai bouffé dans la bagnole.
Quand j'aurai fini d'écrire
mes mémoires,
je m'assurerai d'y ajouter ça.
Tu vois ce que je viens de manger
dans la voiture ?
Un putain de sandwich au thon.
Dans le but d'empêcher
la mauvaise humeur, Norman,
tu devrais varier
le menu du candidat.
Si tu as fini de mâchouiller,
écoutons ces nouveaux spots radio.
On a vu ce que Tommy Carcetti
peut faire à la mairie
en tant que conseiller.
L'administration présente est partiale
et protège ses intérêts.
Mais Tommy Carcetti a sponsorisé
une législation
qui protège les emplois
en évitant le surdéveloppement
des quais.
300 000. Super.
Merci de l'info.
...qui ont empêché des réductions
de budget pour la commune...
Un trois et cinq zéros. La dernière pub
du maire, quatre semaines avant.
- Éteins ça !
- Ils ne te plaisent pas ?
J'ai lu les textes avant le mixage
en studio. Ils sont bien.
C'est des conneries ! C'est nul !
Moi-même, je voterais pas pour moi.
Putain !
Au diable Royce !
Au diable Tony Gray !
Et moi pareil !
Où on va ?
Un quartier
entre Oliver et Middle-East.
Parfait, comme nom.
C'est Fallujah ici.
Tu as intérêt à assurer.
Mme Victorina Simmons.
Elle a la main mise
sur deux quartiers importants,
peu importe de quel côté l'EDC
se met...
Au diable Royce !
300 000 comme si c'était rien !
Il y a aussi le révérend Garnett.
De quoi ils se plaignent aujourd'hui ?
Quel trou, cette ville.
Des imbéciles pleurnichards,
qui se plaignent de la saleté
ou du crime ou d'autre chose.
C'est de ma faute, tout ça ?
Quels enfoirés.
Ils peuvent aller se faire foutre.
Mlle Simmons.
Révérend Garnett.
Ravi de vous revoir.
Je suis en retard, j'étais en réunion,
mais je suis là, prêt à voir
ce que vous voulez me montrer.
On appelle la mairie sans arrêt,
mais rien n'est fait.
Montrez-moi.
Par ici, monsieur.
La première chose
que je veux vous montrer...
Il faut boire beaucoup.
Il faut penser à de l'eau qui coule.
Comme ça...
Qu'est-ce que tu sais de l'eau, Duke ?
T'as pas d'eau chez toi
depuis l'an dernier.
Bien dit.
Je suis prêt.
Je peux pas pisser
si vous me regardez.
Quand on appelle,
il envoie quelqu'un
la plupart du temps,
et ils écrivent tout
comme il le fait maintenant.
Mais rien n'est jamais fait.
Venez ici, monsieur.
Regardez ça.
Vous les voyez, les petits drogués ?
Ils bloquent les allées
pour pas que la police les attrape.
Toutes ces ordures.
Des rats partout.
Des maisons abandonnées.
On essaie de faire
nettoyer tout ça.
Mais c'est trop demander.
Royce ne permet pas
aux agences communales
d'accepter des appels
de mes électeurs.
Mais je vais voir
ce que je peux faire.
Venez, je vais vous montrer
autre chose.
Vous connaissez un mec
qui s'appelle "Deez" ?
Venez.
Après lui !
Je savais qu'ils nous piégeaient.
Ouais, on vous a eus,
bandes de salopes.
Manquez plus jamais de respect
aux Terrace.
Je me suis pissé dessus !
Par ici !
Défonce-le !
Par ici.
Il est allé par là !
Souvenez-vous que la locution
est la pierre angulaire
de la communication
avec vos élèves.
Ceci s'applique non seulement
aux questions que vous posez,
et à leur compréhension de la leçon,
mais à la façon dont ils vous perçoivent
en tant qu'enseignant.
Et où cela commence-t-il ?
Fort et avec enthousiasme.
J.S.C.E.S.
Encore une fois.
Qu'est-ce qu'on se dit ?
Je suis compétent et sympathique.
Je vois enfin quelques sourires.
...La liste en bas de la page
indique des lieux
de cibles typiques.
Un officier devant une menace
terroriste doit se demander :
"Est-ce que je sais
où sont mes cibles,
celles où des civils en grand nombre
se rassemblent ?"
Gares, bureaux, stades.
Un autre endroit dangereux
dans la classe, c'est le taille-crayons,
où les enfants se rassemblent...
J'avais un taille-crayons
dans ma salle de classe.
Antoine Granderson l'a arraché du mur
et me l'a jeté au visage.
J'aimerais savoir ce que
votre programme éducatif suggère
quand Harold Hounchell jette
tous ses manuels scolaires
à travers la fenêtre fermée.
Du calme.
Pour les procédures d'urgence,
si des substances biochimiques
sont présentes,
veuillez vous référer
à l'annexe B.
Sans vouloir critiquer votre annexe,
si les terroristes voulaient vraiment
tout foutre en l'air,
on s'en rendrait compte ?
Y'a des Al-Quaeda
sur Baltimore Street
qui ont l'intention de faire sauter
le fast-food du coin.
Mais l'équipe d'Apex les a anéantis,
a pris leurs chameaux
et les a enterrés au Leakin Park.
C'est ce qu'on m'a dit.
Vous parlez de terroristes ?
Allez donc sur Pencey et Gold.
Du calme, messieurs...
Beau boulot.
Pas un mot de plus !
Espèce de bête.
Je peux pas m'en empêcher.
Tu éveilles ma virilité.
Mon petit canard bleu.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
J'en ai un.
Un dealer de rue qui s'appelle Lex.
Lester l'avait sur écoute.
Lester bosse aux écoutes ?
T'es vraiment à la masse.
Tu connais ce môme ? Lex ?
Il me dit quelque chose.
Tu devrais demander à Carver.
Il adorerait s'en charger.
D'accord pour Carver.
J'ai quand même envie de t'enlever
cet uniforme.
- Pour quoi faire ?
- La nostalgie, Jimmy.
Toi et moi à nos repères préférés ?
Moi et mon Glenlivet,
toi et ton Jameson.
On irait voir si le train est toujours là.
Pourquoi tu viens pas dîner un soir ?
Viens dire bonjour à Beadie
et aux morpions.
Un dîner ?
...se trouvant dans les tours
ainsi que les habitations,
sont listés avec...
Ces conneries ? Sérieux ?
Mes gosses ont besoin
de fournitures scolaires.
Namond, je te rembourserai.
T'auras jamais de fric.
Michael, ils t'ont eu.
Juste une petite bagarre.
Tout le monde est bien rentré ?
Non, le patron a dû se faire faire
des points de suture.
Ils l'ont tapé avec une brique.
Tu t'es déjà changé.
Ouais, ça puait.
Randy, c'était l'idée la plus idiote
que t'aies jamais eue.
Ouais,
mais c'était marrant sur le coup.
Vous trouvez pas ?
Vous voulez quelque chose
avant qu'il sorte ?
C'est moi qui paye.
Un billet pour chaque soldat
qui a tenu le coup.
- J'y étais.
- Va te faire, Duke.
Tu t'en es bien sorti ?
Ouais. Je me suis fait mal
à la cheville, mais...
Mais tu as pu t'échapper.
Le lieutenant-gouverneur
est hors de lui,
car deux comités
démocrates nationaux...
Je sais, on est en retard...
Peu importe.
Tu as bien fait de rester.
Éteins ces conneries.
Tu crois vraiment qu'ils vont
voter pour un blanc ?
Les noirs votent pour des blancs
depuis longtemps.
Si vous êtes réglos, on écoute.
C'est vous qui votez jamais
pour un noir.
En tout cas, tu as mon vote.
Et toi, Norman ?
Tu es mon directeur de campagne
et je n'ai pas ton vote ?
Le dernier blanc pour qui j'ai voté,
c'était Bobby Kennedy,
et tu lui arrives pas à la cheville.
Mais tu viens de dire...
Je parlais en général de la nature
bienveillante des noirs.
Moi en particulier, je suis pas
si bienveillant que ça.
Alors tu vas accepter
mon putain de chèque
et diriger ma putain de campagne...
Je crache pas dans la soupe.
Ça, c'est sûr !
Pour qui tu vas voter ?
Royce ? Tony Gray ?
L'un des deux.
Ne m'oblige pas à te le répéter.
C'est 21:00 précise.
Je sens de l'urine.
Où étais-tu passé ?
On jouait avec Dukie aujourd'hui.
Tu sais qu'il a pas d'habits propres.
C'est bien que ce gosse ait des amis,
je suppose.
Rentre.
Arrête.
Allez, Dougie, je sais qu'il est tard,
mais il faut que je trouve
un moyen détourné,
les agences ne vont rien faire.
Tu le sais bien.
- Allez, Tommy...
- Dépêche-toi.
C'est ridicule.
Dougie,
désolé de t'embêter chez toi,
mais ce con de Royce
refuse de traiter toute demande
venant de moi.
J'ai juste besoin que quelques allées
soient nettoyées.
Oui, autour de 1200 Federal Street,
des deux côtés.
Et puis aussi Chester, Collington,
dans toutes les directions autour.
Je sais que tu y seras
dans quelques jours.
Appelle Frankie et fais-lui envoyer
un camion d'asphalte froide.
Federal Street ressemble
à un fossé antichar.
Merci. Mes amitiés à Denise.
Dépêche-toi, Tom.
Vous êtes deux heures
en retard.
Vous gagnerez pas en manquant
de respect à vos électeurs.
Attendez, Tony.
Il faut qu'on parle.
Je suis navré de la tournure
qu'ont pris les choses.
Mais peu importe, si vous êtes élu,
je ferai tout ce que je peux
pour vous aider,
et si je suis élu,
j'aurai besoin de votre aide.
Ça n'a rien de personnel, Tony.
Allez vous faire foutre.
C'est ma classe ?
Eh oui.
Quoi de neuf ?
Les Coréens m'ont fait un prix
sur tout ça aujourd'hui.
À la rentrée, je les vendrai
pour trois fois plus.
D'accord,
je prends des Skittles.
Rends-moi un service
pour la monnaie.
Va là-bas dire à Lex
qu'une nana veut le voir
- au terrain de jeu derrière Fort.
- Une nana ?
Dis-lui que Patrice veut qu'il vienne
au terrain de jeu après 20:00.
Dis-lui toi-même.
Écoute, j'en ai marre d'entendre
les sermons de Bodie
sur mes heures de boulot.
Rends-moi ce service.
Pour un maigrichon,
il transpire un max.
Il faut garder une tenue de rechange
dans la bagnole,
pour pas être obligés de rentrer
en milieu de journée.
On est déjà en retard, alors...
- Bon sang !
- Attends.
Peut-être que je devrais mettre
des cravates avec clip.
Terri a de nouveaux résultats
de sondage.
Alors, tu es monté ?
Elle veut rien me montrer
avant que tout soit analysé,
mais je mérite de monter, non ?
Plus que quatre semaines, Jen.
Passer du temps avec sa femme
et ses enfants...
Ça a pris quoi, quatre minutes ?
Plutôt six minutes.
Merde, j'aurais pu baiser.
Chris, j'ai rien fait...
Ouais, c'est bon.
Pas de Lex.
Où est cet abruti ?
Il était là tout à l'heure.
Tant pis, on reviendra.
On l'aura demain, pas de problème.
Partagez les sodas.
Quoi de neuf ?
Je peux te dire un mot ?
Quoi ?
Tu as fait ce que je t'ai demandé ?
Sûrement,
parce que le nègre y est allé,
mais il est jamais revenu.
- Chris et Snoop...
- Quoi ?
Relax, d'accord ?
Nos héros rentrent du combat.
Les résultats des sondages
sont prêts ?
Oui, c'est pas mal.
Royce, 35 ; toi, 26 ; Gray, 20.
19 % sont indécis.
On est foutus si on n'en a pas
convaincu plus que ça. Il me faut 30,
et il faut que Tony
lui prenne 25 points.
Les sondages négatifs
contre Royce augmentent.
34 % défavorables
et 43 % favorables ?
Il est vulnérable.
Geri, tu dois comprendre
que pour gagner,
il faut que Tony Gray
prenne une grosse part
des votes de Royce.
Tony a bougé de combien ?
De deux points
ces deux derniers mois ?
Le sondage dit qu'un électeur
sur cinq est indécis.
Les premiers spots radio ont fait
des miracles, hein ?
Combien d'argent on a foutu
en l'air là-dessus ?
Regardez les chiffres du 1er District.
C'est mon territoire,
et j'ai 37 % avec
24 % encore indécis ?
Je suis fini !
Personne ne s'intéresse encore
à cette élection.
Le 1er District sera à nous.
Regarde les résultats de Royce
dans le 4e.
C'est sûr que Tony a besoin
de chiffres à West Baltimore.
Il faut qu'il ait 25 % ,
et bientôt 30 %.
Et au fait,
qui peut me dire quand le 6e District
est devenu noir à 64 % ?
Il y a environ cinq ans,
quand ils ont restructuré les districts,
surtout, si mon souvenir est bon,
pour te donner plus de votes blancs
dans le 1er.
Qu'est-ce qui m'a pris ?
Tout peut arriver entre maintenant
et le jour de l'élection.
J'ai déjà perdu en ayant de meilleurs
chiffres que Royce à cette étape.
Je ne gagnerai pas.
Tommy, où tu vas ?
C'est moi qui te raccompagne.
Il sait lire un sondage.
Vous avez bu ?
Je vais bien.
Circulez.
Le couvre-feu du parc est à minuit.
La ville a une moyenne
d'un meurtre par jour
et vous me parlez
du règlement du parc ?
Vous faites le malin ?
Désolé. J'ai rien dit.
Je vous connais ?
Je me présente aux élections
municipales.
Tommy Carcetti, 1er District.
Je reviendrai dans 20 minutes,
monsieur.
Je vous en prie, allez plus loin.
Randy ?
Il avait un petit-déjeuner
de prévu, non ?
C'est ce qu'on m'a dit hier soir.
Ah bon ?
C'est sur son emploi du temps ?
Non, mais le lieutenant m'a dit
qu'il avait un petit-déjeuner
avec quelqu'un près du port.
Si c'est pas le cas,
je pourrais aller faire le plein.
Je déteste cette affectation.
Y'a plein d'avantages.
Je déteste rester là à attendre.
Selon Hoskins, si je fais ça un an,
je serai sergent juste derrière.
Ils m'ont dit qu'au niveau carrière,
il n'y a pas mieux que d'être
le chauffeur du maire.
Si on pouvait monter en grade
normalement,
je bosserais toujours
sur le district ouest.
Et merde.
Je vais chercher le lieutenant.
Si on me cherche,
je serai au premier étage.
Il paraît que le maire
a un petit-déjeuner au port.
Avec Kweisi.
Ce n'est pas confirmé, je crois.
Savez-vous par hasard
où se trouve le lieutenant Hoskins ?
Lieutenant ?
SUR ÉCOUTE
"Je me réveillerai encore blanc
dans une ville qui ne l'est pas".
Vous n'avez pas l'air content,
inspecteur.
On est sur le point de faire
de grosses prises.
Peut-être trop grosses.
Un sénateur, deux conseillers,
l'agence du développement urbain,
tous ces promoteurs...
Les princes de la ville.
Lester, ça ne t'a pas effleuré
que toutes ces histoires
puissent nous exploser à la gueule ?
Sais-tu ce que
Theodore Roosevelt a dit
au sujet de la chasse au grizzli ?
Le frisson gît dans le fait
de surmonter sa propre peur.
Et l'ours, il avait des frissons ?
J'aurais dû montrer ces assignations
à ma direction.
Ce n'est pas la procédure.
J'emmerde la procédure.
Mon patron a deux points de retard
dans les sondages,
avec le soutien du maire.
Comment va-t-il s'en sortir
s'il fout Royce en pétard
et flingue ses propres partenaires ?
Pourquoi ça vous importe ?
Si Demper pense que
je l'ai entubé et qu'il gagne,
je me retrouve en pénal à rédiger
les demandes de caution.
S'il perd, une nouvelle équipe arrive
et ils renverront peut-être
la petite blanche au tribunal
pour donner la division
des narcotiques à un des leurs.
C'est Baltimore, Lester.
Il manque deux assignations.
Ah bon ?
Clay Davis et Andy Krawczyk.
J'attends jusqu'à octobre.
Hors de question.
Si on envoie des assignations
à un de ces gars
trois semaines avant les primaires,
ce sera l'apocalypse.
C'est ce que je disais !
Clay Davis est l'adjoint
responsable de la campagne de Royce
et le numéro deux
au caucus législatif de la ville.
Et Krawczyk est son premier
collecteur de fonds !
Vous me donnez des CV et des titres.
Je ne fais que suivre l'argent.
Et nous le suivrons...
une fois les votes clos.
On pourra lancer une seconde fournée
d'assignations.
Pourquoi le faire maintenant
et risquer...
Il y a un an,
si on avait suivi cette piste,
la mairie aurait piétiné cette unité
et les assignations.
Dans un mois,
quand Royce sera réélu,
ils vont faire pareil.
Mais là,
avec les primaires qui arrivent,
ils vont se soucier des apparences,
de leur comportement.
Ils doivent éviter les scandales.
Vous m'aviez dit vouloir le faire
il y a un an,
mais de nouvelles enquêtes
vous en avaient empêché.
C'est ce que vous m'aviez dit.
Très malin, Lester.
Vous aviez tout calculé, hein ?
Moi ?
Je ne suis qu'un policier.
J'ai vu que le syndicat des profs
allait soutenir Royce.
Vous le saviez.
À quelle heure est
votre première apparition ?
Aujourd'hui ?
Je vous retrouve au forum SoWeBo.
Ce soir, les gosses et moi,
auprès de Tommy
chez le collecteur Roland Park.
Je ferais mieux
d'accélérer les choses.
Un coup de pied au cul aide parfois.
- B-5 ?
- Non, Papa, D-5.
T'es sûre que t'as pas dit B-5 ?
D-5. J'ai touché quoi ?
Un sous-marin.
E-6.
Raté.
Accorde-moi 10 minutes.
Tu as vu le programme du jour ?
Tu n'as pas 10 minutes.
Norman, j'ai coincé
le porte-avions de cette jeune fille.
- D-4.
- Touché !
Tommy, bon sang.
J'ai une chance de gagner ?
Avec les chiffres actuels,
est-ce vraiment possible ?
S'il faut juste jouer le jeu,
c'est ce que je vais faire.
La partie est presque finie.
Mais cette partie-là...
Elle peut encore aller
dans les deux sens.
H-11, ma chérie.
Raté. D-3.
Vous avez tout ce qu'il vous faut ?
- Brianna garde un œil sur vous ?
- Elle casque.
L'argent arrive chaque mois,
comme elle a dit.
Bien, parce que
je me tiens à carreau ici.
Ils ont pas besoin de s'inquiéter
pour moi
et je m'inquiète pas pour eux.
- T'es un soldat, Bey.
- Et comment.
Tout va bien avec mes poissons ?
Tu me le dirais si ça allait pas ?
Les poissons vont bien.
C'est des poissons, non ?
Je sais pas ce qu'ils ressentent.
- De'Londa...
- Ils vont bien.
Demande à Namond.
J'ai nettoyé le réservoir,
comme tu as dit.
Le filtre aussi.
Regarde-toi.
Tu as du duvet, là, hein ?
Ouais, c'est ça.
Quand j'étais gamin,
j'étais impatient de pouvoir me raser.
L'un des vieux dans la rue
me disait :
"Tu veux te faire pousser
la moustache, gamin ?
La prochaine fois que tu pisses,
prends un peu de pisse,
mets-en sur tes doigts
et fais comme ça".
Tu l'as fait ?
Et comment.
Merde.
Quoi de neuf, sinon ?
Pas grand-chose.
C'est bientôt la rentrée.
Et Bodie et ses gars ?
Ils te traitent bien ?
Ouais, il est cool.
Ne mens pas à ton père.
Il se pointe même pas au boulot
la moitié du temps.
- Bodie me l'a dit.
- J'ai raté quelques jours, c'est tout.
Et tu dépenses le peu d'argent
que tu te fais en bêtises.
Si tu crois que je vais
te donner un centime
pour des habits pour l'école,
tu peux toujours rêver.
Bodie te fait faire quoi ?
Je suis livreur.
Faut bien commencer quelque part.
Tu ferais mieux d'écouter ton père.
Il t'a rien dit sur tes cheveux ?
Il a dit que je devais les couper.
J'aime bien comme ça.
Même les flics blancs
à trois pâtés de maison
pourront te repérer
parmi tous les autres Blacks.
Ils vont dire : "Regarde-le là-bas,
avec sa queue de cheval.
Attrapons-le".
Tu crois que je déconne.
Dehors, soit t'es un vrai,
soit tu l'es pas.
Tu piges ?
J'en veux !
Par ici.
- 100 $ !
- Merci !
C'est mon argent !
Tu vas faire parler de toi.
Tu parles mieux que moi,
et je bosse avec ces Mexicains
depuis des années.
Je crois pas qu'ils appelleraient
ce que je parle de l'espagnol.
Juste un gros mot ici et là.
Une fois que tu peux leur parler,
il suffit plus qu'un camion.
Tu pourrais diriger ta propre équipe,
trouver de nouveaux clients.
Si on faisait équipe,
on pourrait couvrir deux fois plus
et se faire deux fois plus.
Non, j'ai d'autres obligations.
C'est vrai.
Tu es prêt pour devenir
le nouvel Angelo Dundee.
J'avais oublié.
Je croyais que tu étais déjà allé
à Mondawmin pour t'acheter
des affaires d'école.
Ouais, mais pas tout.
Et mon gars,
il doit payer pour ses affaires
et son petit frère aussi.
Je ressemble à quoi,
aux services sociaux ?
Si tu veux un chèque, va à Rosemont.
Vas-y, mec. Je bosserai.
Nay, je t'ai pris
par respect pour ton père.
Mais je peux pas engager
tout le voisinage.
Tu peux prendre mon boulot
jusqu'à ce tu aies assez pour toi et Bug.
Ça marche pour vous,
ça marche pour moi.
Les flics. Cassez-vous.
On cherche ton pote, Lex.
Je vois son balai, mais pas lui.
Qu'est-ce qu'il fout, ton numéro deux ?
- Je l'ai pas vu.
- Depuis quand ?
Je croyais qu'on s'entendait bien.
Tu veux que je repasse ici
tous les quarts d'heure
pour chercher Lex ?
S'il vient, je vous appelle.
C'est vrai !
S'il vient.
Je ne sais pas.
Ils pédalent dans la choucroute.
Tu sais, ce pauvre Tony Gray,
qui capte 20 % du vote noir.
C'est gênant.
Qui sait ce que
Carcetti essaie de prouver ?
Mais au final,
il va regretter d'avoir été contre moi.
J'ai tout ce qu'il te faut.
Des t-shirts de toutes les tailles.
Tu cherches des chaussettes,
des slips,
des dés, des Zippos, des cartes...
Viens voir le centre
commercial ambulant.
Plus besoin d'aller au magasin.
C'est le magasin qui vient à toi.
Qu'est-ce qu'il te faut ?
Des dés et un paquet de préservatifs.
Tu as des Philly Blunts ?
Bubbles a tout.
On trouve tout ici.
- Ça fait combien ?
- Six et quelques.
Je vois ce que tu regardes.
Deux le lot. C'est de la marque.
Le prix est imbattable.
Donne-moi deux lots
et un t-shirt blanc, XXL.
Donne-moi aussi les bombes
à peinture qu'il te reste.
D'accord, voilà. C'est tout ?
Ça fait ?
Combien doit monsieur, Sherrod ?
- 13 $.
- Il a demandé toutes les bombes.
Trois bombes, ça fait 12 $,
plus le reste.
Ça fait 19 $.
Allez, tu fais une affaire,
tu n'as même pas eu à te déplacer.
On est venu à toi, non ?
C'est ma faute.
19 $, comme il a dit.
C'est un stagiaire. Je le forme.
En fait, madame, je veux savoir
quand vous avez vu Lex
pour la dernière fois.
Pardon... Curtis ?
- Il y a deux jours ?
- Je sais pas où il est.
Trois jours ?
Je peux jeter un coup d'œil ?
Je préfère que vous quittiez
ma maison.
Mme Anderson...
Votre fils a des ennuis
et je vois bien que vous êtes remuée.
Le mieux que vous puissiez
faire pour lui,
et le mieux qu'il puisse
faire pour lui-même,
c'est de me parler.
Je vais vous dire la vérité.
Nous savons qu'il vend de la drogue.
Et je vais vous dire...
Je ne suis au courant de rien.
Je vous dis que je me moque
qu'il vende de la drogue.
Je ne vais même pas en parler.
Je suis là à propos
d'un meurtre.
Pour le moment, tout indique
que votre garçon se cache de la police
du fait de ce meurtre.
Je sais pas où il est...
Monsieur, mes gars
n'ont été augmentés que sur l'inflation
depuis quatre ans.
Le moral est au plus bas.
Dans l'idéal, vous seriez notre homme.
On aime ce qu'on entend.
Les sondages disent
que ça va être Royce.
Si on vous soutient maintenant,
on est fichus.
Bobby... C'est peut-être le moment
de poser les fondations
d'une monde meilleur.
Peut-être, commandant.
Mais pour le moment,
on va jouer les cartes
qu'on a en mains.
Monsieur, à ma place,
je suis sûr...
Je me couvrirais
et soutiendrais Royce,
comme les profs et les pompiers.
Je dirais aussi aux cotisants
de ne pas en faire trop.
C'est une chose
si le syndicat de la police
soutient Royce,
c'est autre chose si des policiers
qui ne sont pas en service
œuvrent dans les centres
d'appel du maire
et les bureaux de vote.
Je doute qu'un seul de mes officiers
soit trop démonstratif
envers quiconque.
Ça, je peux vous le garantir.
Vous avez fait de votre mieux,
Tommy.
Royce fait flipper tous ces connards.
J'ai fait de mon mieux.
Va te reposer, Tommy.
Tu as le débat de demain à préparer.
Oui, le débat.
Rien n'est plus
important que ça.
Donne-moi le fond de ta pensée,
Norman.
Plus rien n'a d'importance.
Vas-y !
T'as pas intérêt à fatiguer,
parce que tu vas être mis à l'épreuve
- samedi soir.
- Je suis prêt.
- Mlle Johnson.
- Salut, Justin. Bonjour, Dennis.
Vous êtes la mère de Spider ?
Oui, Sharon Johnson.
- Votre fils est parti il y a longtemps.
- Je ne suis pas venu le chercher.
Il est chez sa grand-mère.
Je voulais vous demander
quelque chose.
Mon fils est dingue de vous.
Il ne parle plus que de boxe,
d'aller au gymnase,
de ce que son coach lui apprend.
Spider est un bon petit.
Il est passionné par le sport.
Je vous suis reconnaissante
de l'intérêt que vous portez à Spider.
Je veux vous faire à dîner.
Ce soir ?
C'est vraiment gentil, Sharon.
Mais j'ai quatre gars
qui combattent ce week-end
et je dois les entraîner
les prochains soirs.
Vous êtes ici tous les soirs.
Vous vous amusez jamais ?
Il faut bien que vous mangiez, non ?
Regardez-moi, vous pouvez être sûr
que je sais ce que je fais
en cuisine...
et ailleurs aussi.
Je vais vous dire :
si vous me faites un plat
et l'apportez ici, j'en serais ravi.
Je peux le faire.
- Il a dit quoi ?
- "Moi ? Je ne suis qu'un policier".
Avec son air de pas y toucher.
Ce qui m'agace le plus,
c'est qu'il ne se joue pas
seulement du système,
il se joue de moi aussi.
Comme si c'était moi, le problème.
Tu comptais garder les papiers
pour Davis et Krawczyk, non ?
Jusqu'à la fin des primaires.
Et maintenant, tu culpabilises.
Il a fait ce truc,
où il te fixe en regardant
par-dessus ses lunettes ?
Ce regard veut dire :
"Je suis le père que tu n'as jamais eu
et je ne veux plus jamais
que tu me déçoives".
C'est pas marrant, Cedric !
Ces assignations ont été émises
aujourd'hui !
La direction va péter un plomb !
Mais tu l'as fait quand même.
Désolé, mais ça me fait plaisir
de voir Lester le faire
à quelqu'un d'autre que moi.
Tu nous empêches
d'avancer, Sherrod.
J'ai fait une erreur.
Arrête ton trip.
Si je pouvais compter sur toi
pour gérer l'argent,
on couvrirait deux fois plus de terrain,
on vendrait deux fois plus
de marchandise.
Avec plus de...
Comment on dit ?
De part de marché.
Au lieu de ça, je dois rester avec toi.
Tu devrais déjà avoir
ton propre chariot.
Tu ne fais que te limiter toi-même.
- Quoi ?
- Tu dois progresser en maths
si tu veux évoluer
dans cette entreprise.
Tu te rappelles, au printemps dernier,
quand tu as essayé
de me mettre à Harlem Park ?
Ils ont pas trouvé mes bulletins.
Ils voulaient pas de moi.
Ils t'ont mis en cours, non ?
Le prof ne m'a pas regardé
une seule fois.
Alors tu t'es barré.
Et qui en subit les conséquences ?
Le prof ou toi ?
Combien font quatre fois cinq
plus six fois sept ?
Tu vois ?
Je m'en fous.
J'ai hâte que ce soit la rentrée.
- Tu blagues ?
- Non, sérieux.
Je veux voir les filles,
voir lesquelles ont pris
du cul cet été.
Devine qui j'ai vu
la semaine dernière ?
- Qui ?
- Kwaneese Davis.
Tu veux dire, Kwaneese Joli-cul ?
Elle a pris du cul ?
Et des nibards aussi.
Je vais me taper cette chatte,
vous allez voir.
Je vais être sur Kwaneese cette année,
comme ça, fourrant...
Comme t'as essayé l'an dernier ?
Je t'emmerde. J'ai essayé qu'un peu.
Alors Michael,
avec qui tu sors cette année ?
Celle qui roule du cul.
Comment elle s'appelle ?
Tina.
Tina Jenkins.
Ne dis pas de mal de Tina.
Je dis rien de mal.
Je dis qu'elle a sucé des gars
dans les vestiaires des garçons,
- c'est tout.
- C'est vrai.
Elle suce encore mieux que toi,
Namond.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Allez, frappe.
Du calme !
Déchire pas ce maillot.
Je viens juste de l'acheter.
Michael,
si j'avais pas eu ce truc sur moi,
je t'aurais éclaté la tronche. Juré.
Les mecs, vous avez rien à foutre ?
Quoi de neuf, Monk ?
La rentrée est bientôt, non ?
- La semaine prochaine.
- Il vous faut des habits et tout ?
Tiens.
C'est pour quoi ?
Tu m'écoutes pas ?
Pour tes fringues
et tout ce qu'il te faut d'autre.
- Merci !
- Putain, 200 ?
C'est Marlo qu'il faut remercier.
Il veut pas que des petits cons
comme vous
aient l'air de clodos le premier jour.
C'est lui, Marlo ?
On te demande rien en échange.
Je peux prendre le sien
s'il en veut pas.
- Je peux garder le sien...
- Abuse pas.
Abuse pas.
C'est quoi, ton problème ?
T'es trop bien pour mon argent ?
Ou t'es un tel froussard
que tu flippes à cause
de la provenance de l'argent ?
Y'a pas de mal, petit.
On est cool.
Tu dis rien à personne.
Jure-moi que tu vas pas cafter.
Et il t'a vu ?
Oui, il m'a vu.
Carv, je l'ai vraiment
dans le cul cette fois.
- Tu lui as dit quoi ?
- J'ai dit : "M. le maire,
vous avez une belle grosse bite
et vous savez vous en servir".
J'ai rien dit !
Et j'ai pas attendu
qu'il dise quelque chose.
Je serai jamais gradé, c'est sûr.
Je finirai sur un bateau
comme McNulty.
C'est au-dessus
de mes compétences.
On a besoin de quelqu'un
qui maîtrise la politique.
Qui on connaît ?
Il t'attend sur la criminalité,
et il va essayer de te piéger
en s'appuyant sur les stats
où les crimes baissent.
Il va aussi tenter de s'innocenter
en se défaussant sur toi.
En jouant la carte raciale quand tu parles
de drogue et de violence.
Il espère que tu vas reculer.
Mais tu vas y aller
deux fois plus fort :
"Clarence Royce n'a pas fait
de cette ville un lieu sûr".
Salut, Jen, ça va ?
- Tu as une seconde ?
- Oui, c'est pour quoi ?
- Tu as oublié le chèque.
- Non, tu plaisantes ?
Tu dois payer tout de suite.
Non, non, j'ai le numéro ici.
Je m'en occupe tout de suite.
Merde.
J'ai oublié d'envoyer le chèque
à ce putain d'archidiocèse.
Mes gosses vont se faire virer
de St. Albans si je me reprends pas.
Tommy. Concentre-toi.
Il va attaquer avec le racisme
et des stats bidon sur les crimes.
J'ignore le truc racial
et je le contre en disant
que les meurtres ont pris 15% ,
alors que les autres crimes
sont en baisse de 12 %.
J'insiste en disant
que ça n'a pas de sens
à moins que Royce
ne trafique les stats,
en faisant disparaître les vols,
les viols et les agressions.
Je suggère que le maire
ne dit pas la vérité sur le crime.
Je conclue en disant
que c'est pour tout Baltimore,
pour chaque quartier,
que je fais de la sécurité publique
la pierre angulaire de ma campagne.
Demain soir, je l'écrase.
Mais le lendemain,
je me réveillerai encore blanc
dans une ville qui ne l'est pas.
Sœur Theresa ?
Comment allez-vous ?
Ici Tommy Carcetti.
Randy, tu m'as fait halluciner.
Courir après lui en disant :
"Je prends le sien, M. Monk.
Donnez-moi le sien".
J'ai besoin de ce supplément.
J'ai dépensé l'argent
que Mme Anna m'a donné
sur des trucs à vendre à l'école.
En plus, Marlo voulait qu'on l'ait.
Il veut nous montrer
qui tire les ficelles dans le coin.
- Michael, pourquoi tu l'as pas pris ?
- C'est pas mon truc.
- Quoi ?
- De devoir des trucs aux autres.
- C'est pas mon truc.
- Je prendrai toujours son blé,
- s'il a envie de le distribuer.
- Pourquoi ?
Ta famille a plus d'argent
que nous tous réunis.
Ma mère m'a coupé les vivres,
elle veut pas m'acheter
de fringues et tout.
T'as déjà pris mon taf
avec Bodie, alors...
Messieurs.
Donut, t'es malade.
Tu peux nous voler
un camping car ?
Tu tires un camping car,
on peut tous aller camper
- dans les bois.
- Je flipperais dans les bois.
Je pensais pas loin.
Je pensais au comté d'Howard.
Le Ku Klux Klan vit par là.
C'est connu.
Ma tante vit dans le comté de Howard.
Y'a pas de Ku Klux Klan là-bas.
T'es bête ou quoi ?
Donut, conduis-moi loin
de ces abrutis ignorants.
On peut rien dire à ces négros.
Avance, putain.
T'arrives à voir
au-dessus du volant ?
Tu penses qu'il va me parler ?
Cite mon nom si besoin.
J'ai eu un de ses secteurs
pendant huit mois.
Y'a un problème, là, non ?
S'il y en avait
une noire sur le parking,
j'en aurais pris une.
Les keufs !
760 à Central.
Besoin de renfort
entre Calhoun et Mosher,
six à huit jeunes se dirigeant à pied
vers le nord, vers Calhoun.
Bien reçu.
Central à toutes les unités...
J'aime ça.
Comme au bon vieux temps.
J'ai pas besoin de courser
ces crétins.
J'en connais la moitié.
Je sais où ils crèchent.
En plus, t'es trop habillé.
Passons juste l'appel radio
et allons régler ton histoire.
J'ai rien fait !
- J'ai rien fait !
- Alors pourquoi tu cours ?
- Parce que vous me coursez.
- C'est quoi, ton nom ?
- C'est vrai. J'ai rien fait.
- C'est quoi, ton nom ?
- Randy.
- Randy comment ?
- Wagstaff.
- Je sais que tu mens pas.
Personne inventerait un nom pareil.
Mets tes mains contre le mur.
Tu sais quoi sur les mômes
dans la voiture volée ?
Rien.
Petit enculé. Tu deales.
- Non, je le jure.
- C'est ça.
Sinon, tu ferais quoi
avec 200 $ dans la poche ?
Ma mère adoptive me les a donnés
pour la rentrée.
Ta mère adoptive t'a filé
200 $ en liquide ?
Dis-lui de venir au commissariat,
et je les lui rendrai.
Casse-toi, connard,
avant que je te coffre.
Me regarde pas, casse-toi.
Ça, c'est une bombe.
Cela dit, je suis prêt
à les présenter moi-même
pour vous protéger des retours.
J'ai mes 20 ans d'ancienneté.
Vous deux, vous devez vivre
dans ce service.
On les emmerde.
On y va.
Le prix de l'acier étant ce qu'il est,
on ne survivra pas
si on ne peut pas écouler le surplus.
M. Krawczyk ?
Police de Baltimore.
- C'est quoi ?
- Une assignation.
Vous en avez besoin maintenant ?
Je suis plutôt débordé aujourd'hui.
Avant la date limite.
Je crois que c'est la loi.
- Aucun problème, inspecteur...
- Shakima Greggs.
Vous êtes à la ville ?
- Quelle unité ?
- Unité anti-crime.
Sénateur.
C'est quoi ?
Une assignation.
Le Sphinx Club ?
- L'homme de l'année...
- C'est quoi, ces conneries ?
Vous êtes complètement cinglés.
Vous étiez au Sphinx Club ?
Mon oncle tenait le bar là-bas.
Marvin Thompson ?
Un petit gars...
Quel est votre nom, officier ?
Inspecteur Sydnor.
"Unité anti-crime" ?
Merde.
Bonne journée.
Je vais pas me laisser faire.
Bien joué, mon salaud<i>..</i>
Tu serres trop, mec.
Tu m'appelles encore ?
Et j'ai dit quoi ?
Il a eu le message, idiot.
Monk. C'est qui, mec ?
Old Face André.
Tiens, laisse-moi lui parler.
Mate-moi ça, mec.
Je vais te montrer
comment on fait,
regarde un peu.
Me fous pas la pression.
On verra ça quand je te verrai.
Rappelle-toi à qui tu parles
avant de dire un autre mot.
Il a plus besoin qu'on le prenne par la main
que les mères de mes gosses.
C'était un accident.
Et le maire ne dit rien ?
Il doit être furieux.
Commandant,
j'ai pris cette mission
uniquement pour devenir sergent.
Tu es déjà passé sergent.
Si Royce est réélu,
tu seras lieutenant dans deux ans
et commandant dans quatre.
Tu retournes à la mairie.
Tu fais comme si rien ne s'était passé.
Et tu la fermes.
Ne dis rien à personne.
Mais le maire, il va...
Il va observer et voir
comment tu gères ça.
Tu seras un roc.
Quand le maire te regardera
dans les yeux,
il saura qu'il peut
te faire confiance.
Et je te parie que
dans quelques semaines,
il viendra te demander
très gentiment :
"Qu'as-tu envie faire
dans le service ?
Côté carrière ?"
Tu l'intéresseras.
Mais il ne parlera pas de pipe
et toi non plus.
Il faut laisser ça de côté
comme un mauvais ravioli
dans l'assiette.
On fait comme si on le voyait pas.
Et s'il me baise ?
S'il me fout en équipe de nuit ?
S'il fait ça, tu parleras.
Qu'est-ce que je donnerais pas
pour être à ta place.
Des carrières ont été lancées
avec bien moins que ça.
Ferme-la et joue l'idiot.
Je peux le faire.
Sans problème.
Merci d'avoir pris le temps
de me rencontrer.
Ça m'enlève un poids de vous parler.
Vraiment.
Pas de problème.
Peut-être me rendras-tu
la pareille un jour
quand tu auras pris
du grade, hein ?
C'est tout bon, Carv.
Car si les putains de fédéraux
passent la porte, je me dis :
"Ça fait partie du jeu".
Mais la police ?
De Baltimore ? Non !
Ça peut pas arriver.
J'ai fait lever trop d'argent
pour le maire et son parti.
Aucune âme au monde
n'est aussi ingrate !
- Calmez-vous, Clay.
- Du blanchiment d'argent ?
Ils vont venir me parler
de blanchiment d'argent ?
À Baltimore ouest ?
Où croyez-vous
que je vais trouver l'argent
pour le parti ?
À une laverie automatique ?
Dans les épiceries coréennes ?
Vous croyez que j'ai le temps
de demander à un mec
pourquoi il me donne de l'argent ?
Ou d'où vient son argent ?
Je prends l'argent de n'importe
quel mec, s'il me le donne.
- Je ne veux pas le savoir.
- Je le sais bien.
Mais je fais tout mon possible
pour vous, Clarence.
Pour vous, moi
et le reste de l'équipe.
Et qui passe ma porte ?
La police de Baltimore
qui cherche
à me foutre dans la merde.
Clay, on n'était pas au courant.
Désolé, je dois me barrer d'ici
avant de perdre la boule.
Personne n'était au courant.
Si vous voulez mener une campagne
avec mon argent sous votre cul,
vos soldats vont devoir me lâcher,
Clarence.
Krawczyk sur la ligne 1.
Je m'occupe de Burrell et Demper.
- Je vais voir ce qui se passe.
- Une minute.
Le nouveau chauffeur,
le chauve, un blanc.
D'où il vient ?
Hoskins l'a introduit, je crois.
Hoskins avait pas
un meilleur rabbin que ça
dans le service ?
Vous voulez le virer ?
Je vais y réfléchir.
L'officier Walker se la joue obscur.
Les flics nous volent.
Ce que je veux,
c'est une Bubble Caprice.
J'en ai vu une bien.
Une de 94 avec des jantes de 22.
Tu devrais faire gaffe.
Ils t'ont presque eu aujourd'hui.
Les Blacks se font pas attraper.
Taisez-vous, les gars.
Vous savez qui je suis, non ?
Carver. T'es un condé.
Aujourd'hui,
j'enquête les vols de voitures.
Juste un avertissement.
Si j'en vois un
ne serait-ce que sourire
à une voiture,
ce sera pas le juge pour enfants.
Non, ce sera mes gars
qui s'occuperont de vous
dans les allées. Compris ?
- Vous pouvez pas faire ça.
- Me tente pas, Namond.
Eh oui, je connais ton nom.
Je sais où tu vis.
Je sais où vous zonez.
Jolie caisse.
Tu as trouvé ton tireur ?
Non, il est en fuite.
Au moins, je sais qui est mon tireur.
J'ai juste à le trouver.
La famille balancera rien ?
La mère a rien voulu cracher.
Mais elle a pas menti
comme une autre mère.
- Comment ça ?
- Je sais pas.
J'ai eu une impression bizarre.
J'arrive pas à l'expliquer.
On aurait dit
qu'elle était ailleurs dans sa tête.
Ligne 4. Un appel.
- Qui prend ?
- Moi, je prends.
Non, attends.
Si c'est toi, sale veinard,
ce sera un crime domestique
avec quatre témoins.
- Tu prends l'appel ?
- Mais si je réponds,
je vais porter la poisse ?
Ou ça reste ton appel ?
Tu le veux, prends-le.
Sinon, non.
Criminelle. Norris.
Oui. C'est noté.
1400 Lanvale.
Dans la rue, trouvé par le facteur.
Pas de suspect, pas de témoin.
Vaut mieux être
chanceux que bon.
Tu veux travailler sur le sac ?
Vas-y, quatre séries.
Je m'appelle Gail.
J'ai fait ça pour vous
et les autres hommes
pour vous faire savoir
que vous êtes appréciés.
- C'est très gentil.
- Un gâteau à la pêche.
Pardon, vous êtes
la mère de qui déjà ?
Je n'ai pas de garçon.
J'apprécie juste ce que vous faites.
Vous et les autres entraîneurs.
Le bénévolat, tout ça.
Merci, c'est très gentil.
J'ai trois filles.
Vous n'enseignez pas aux filles, non ?
- Non, je suis vieux jeu sur la question.
- Vous avez raison.
Les hommes sont des hommes,
et les femmes des femmes.
C'est ce que je pense.
Simple blessure dans le dos,
pas de douille.
Pas de témoin et pas un indice.
- Déjà mort à votre arrivée ?
- En fait, non.
Il était encore conscient
et crachait du sang.
- Vous lui avez demandé qui a tiré ?
- Ouais, bien sûr.
Il a dit que c'était un gars
avec un flingue.
Tu m'appelles encore ?
Il a eu le message, idiot.
Monk, c'est qui, mec ?
Old Face André
Je vais affiner ça.
Mate-moi ça.
Me fous pas la pression.
- On verra ça quand je te verrai.
- Je dis juste...
Old Face André
Il tente une réappro
chez Monk Metcalf.
Monk a pris
l'appel sur son portable.
Mais la seconde voix
est au-dessus de lui.
Au-dessus de tout le monde.
Marlo Stanfield. Au téléphone.
La manière dont il a parlé,
je dirais oui. C'était lui.
Ouais, mais c'était quoi en fond,
des pétards ?
Non, c'était régulier.
Des semi-automatiques.
Entraînement au tir, peut-être.
Ou alors un peloton d'exécution.
Pas un seul cadavre avec ce gars
depuis des mois,
mais on l'a au téléphone
et on dirait une zone de guerre.
Au moins, il est au téléphone
de temps en temps.
- C'est déjà ça.
- Il semble arrogant, hein ?
Comme s'il était le roi de la terre.
Ah, la jeunesse.
Je croyais que tu dormais.
Si tu veux,
je pourrais aller à l'école.
Ça fait longtemps,
et je sais même pas
si je pourrais.
Mais si tu tiens à ce que j'y aille...
pas de problème.
Sa Majesté était folle de rage ?
Je ne peux même pas le décrire.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il veut qu'on fasse ?
- Qu'on bloque les assignations,
mais il sait que c'est impossible
une fois qu'elles sont émises.
Mais ce que je pourrais lui promettre,
c'est plus d'autre surprise
sortant de notre boutique.
Ça vient de cet enculé de McNulty ?
Pas cette fois. Il n'est plus
dans cette unité depuis un an.
Je pencherais plutôt pour...
Lester Freamon.
- Freamon ?
- Lester est un sacré roublard.
Il faut qu'on l'étouffe, ce connard.
M. le commissaire, cette unité a besoin
d'une supervision adaptée.
L'État du Maryland
vient de perdre
un autre témoin à charge
et je viens de me trouver
un paquet d'heures sup.
Cette affaire est passée de "On
s'en bat d'un meurtre lié à la drogue"
à une affaire prioritaire.
Merde, j'aurais dû décrocher.
Sergent, mon gars est un témoin.
Une affaire de drogue en cours.
Tu es sûr qu'il a été tué
pour cette raison ?
J'en sais foutre rien.
Selon l'ordinateur du tribunal,
ce type est le seul atout de État
Mets pas dans le rapport
que le gars était un témoin.
Crois-moi,
on évite de remuer la merde
une année d'élection.
Bosse dessus, prends les heures sup,
mais oublie que c'est un témoin
tant qu'on n'est pas sûrs.
Et ferme la porte.
Ici Landsman, de la Criminelle.
Le commandant est là, ce matin ?
Sujet suivant :
les règles de la classe.
Ça aide d'être synchros là-dessus.
Il y a moins d'invitation à l'agitation
pour les enfants.
Mme Scott ?
Pareil que l'an dernier :
double espacement.
Cours de littérature.
On fait beaucoup de corrections.
Ils n'écrivent pas mieux,
mais ça préserve ma vue.
Faites une démonstration.
Certains croient que ça veut dire
doubler l'espace entre les mots.
J'aurais pensé qu'en 3ème...
Règle d'or ici, M. Pryzbylewski :
ne présumer de rien.
Expliquez-leur ce qu'ils doivent faire,
faites-leur faire
et expliquez de nouveau.
Avec du temps et de la patience,
ils comprendront.
- Mme Shapiro ?
- Ça sera plus facile de travailler
si on utilise tous le même en-tête.
Coin supérieur droit,
au-dessus de la 1ère ligne bleue :
nom, date et numéro de classe.
Dans cet ordre ?
M. Pryzbylewski,
avez-vous des questions ?
Peut-on leur interdire
les chewing-gums ?
Ils s'abstiennent
chez Mlle Sampson,
mais en quatre ans,
je n'ai rien pu faire.
Essayez, mais la première année,
mieux vaut se tenir à l'essentiel.
L'équipe d'abord : on n'impose
que ce qu'on peut tous imposer.
Gardez vos fenêtres fermées.
Ça les endort,
ce qui est une bonne chose.
Il y a beaucoup à apprendre,
mais pour l'instant,
prévoyez pleins d'activités
dans vos leçons.
Autant que possible.
Gardez-les occupés,
gardez-les attentifs.
Vous devriez adoucir
votre regard.
Pardon ?
Mais ça ne vous empêche pas
de donner plus
au nom de votre femme,
de vos enfants,
s'ils ont des comptes séparés.
Pardon, Richie,
vous patientez un moment ?
Ton copain de la police.
Il dit que c'est important.
Je suis occupé
à perdre une élection.
Tu te souviens, il y a six mois,
tu m'as demandé
de suivre les témoins
qui se font aligner ?
Tu te souviens ?
Qui est meilleur que moi, Tommy ?
Richie, je peux vous rappeler ?
Autre chose, Mlle Donnelly ?
Tu vis près
de chez Duquan Weems, non ?
Dukie ?
Amène ça chez lui.
Ces habits resteront pas
propres longtemps.
Remets-les seulement à Duquan.
Pas aux adultes dans la maison.
- Juste Duquan.
- Je dois le faire ce soir ?
Ça serait bien.
Et Crystal, merci pour aujourd'hui.
De rien, Mlle Donnelly.
Puis-je vous aider ?
Ce jeune homme
doit s'inscrire à l'école.
- Il est élève ici ?
- Il devrait.
Dans quelle classe
étais-tu l'an dernier ?
Il s'est un peu égaré
il y a quelques temps.
Il vit avec moi maintenant.
Et vous êtes son...
Je suis son oncle.
Venez dans mon bureau.
Regarde le coach draguer.
C'est bon.
C'est exactement ça, champion.
Mais utilise ton gauche
- un peu plus, compris ?
- T'as fini ?
- Il me reste deux minutes.
- Je m'en fous, j'ai un combat bientôt.
- Reviens plus tard, d'accord ?
- Il a dit qu'il avait encore une série.
Recule, morveux.
Le sac est à moi pour quatre séries,
- et j'en ai fait que trois.
- Je t'emmerde.
T'essaies de prouver quoi ?
Du calme, du calme.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- J'ai un combat samedi
et il me laisse pas le sac.
Pourquoi t'es sur le sac, d'abord ?
Tu combats pas.
Tu t'entraînes pas.
Je m'entraîne avec toi
quand tu veux.
Viens alors.
Calmez-vous tous, compris ?
J'accepterai pas ces bêtises.
Viens ici, Michael.
- Je peux utiliser le sac maintenant ?
- Pas encore. Attends.
- Vous aviez dit quatre séries.
- Je sais ce que j'ai dit.
Tu finis tes séries
et ensuite, c'est à Justin.
Et plus de langage de la rue ici.
On boxe ici, on se bat pas.
S'il veut monter sur le ring avec moi,
- on y va.
- Regarde-moi.
Je vais te dire un truc.
Tu peux venir ici,
faire de la muscu,
utiliser le matériel.
Mais personne ne monte sur le ring
sans s'être entraîné.
Tu veux t'entraîner ?
Je t'ai regardé frapper le sac.
Tu as une main droite naturelle.
Ta façon de la lancer,
ta façon de frapper.
Si je t'entraînais,
il faudrait commencer au sol.
Si tu sais pas te déplacer,
t'as rien à faire sur ce ring.
Alors, t'en penses quoi ?
Je t'entraînerai moi-même.
Non. Je veux juste continuer
à faire ce que je fais.
Fais voir ta droite.
Dukie est là ?
C'est quoi ?
C'est pour Duquan ?
Je vais lui apporter.
Donne-le moi.
Mlle Donnelly a dit
de te donner ça.
Je descends.
Quoi ?
Que mes adversaires suggèrent
que le développement du centre ville
se fasse aux dépens
des autres quartiers,
c'est injuste, et ça divise l'opinion.
Qu'ils suggèrent
que mon administration
n'a pas été réactive, eh bien...
Le développement économique
ne peut être un pansement.
C'est un processus à long terme
qui demande l'engagement
de former notre main-d'œuvre,
et comme je l'ai dit précédemment,
ceci ne réussira que dans une ville
où les gens se sentent en sécurité.
Donc avant de penser à attirer
de nouvelles industries à Baltimore,
nous devons réfléchir
aux moyens de rendre ces quartiers
et le centre ville de nouveau sûrs.
M. Carcetti pense peut-être
que c'est dans son intérêt
d'exploiter les craintes du public.
Il l'a fait tout au long
de la campagne.
Personnellement, cela me déplaît.
Mais le fait est que
les crimes violents ont diminué
dans toute la ville
et notre département de police
travaille dur
pour que cela continue,
et continuera de le faire
sous ma direction.
Monsieur Carcetti,
vous avez deux minutes
pour répondre.
Quelqu'un ici croit vraiment
que le crime a diminué à Baltimore ?
Vous me traitez
de menteur, Tommy ?
Je vous en prie.
Pas d'interpellation personnelle.
- Monsieur Carcetti.
- Le maire peut-il honnêtement dire
aux gens de Rosemont,
de Belair Edison,
de Highlandtown ou de Cherry Hill
qu'il y a moins de dealers ?
Moins de violence ?
Les statistiques
du département de police
ne sont pas fiables, car sous ce maire,
la police s'inquiète davantage
de protéger politiquement Clarence
Royce que de combattre le crime.
Il n'y a pas de vision
et le moral n'a jamais été aussi bas.
Je changerai cela.
C'est la routine à l'hôtel de ville,
et comme conséquence,
notre réponse à la criminalité
se caractérise sans arrêt
par une cruelle indifférence.
Ce que j'appelle la routine ?
Ce que j'appelle
cruelle indifférence ?
La nuit dernière,
dans le district ouest,
sur Lanvale Street,
un autre citoyen a été abattu.
Cette fois,
la victime était un témoin-clé
dans une affaire de drogue.
Courageusement,
cet homme avait accepté de témoigner
dans deux semaines.
La police aurait dû le protéger.
Ce n'était pas le cas, et il a été tué.
- Merde.
- Pourquoi ? Parce que le maire...
Tu fais la une, Eddie.
...ne voulait dépenser l'argent
pour le protéger.
Je ne doute pas que
dans un instant,
Clarence Royce m'accusera d'exploiter
la mort de cet homme
pour mes intérêts politiques.
Mais la vérité est la suivante :
il y a un an,
j'ai écrit une lettre au maire.
J'ai des copies si nécessaire.
Je l'ai supplié de dépenser
l'argent nécessaire
pour faire de la protection des témoins
une priorité. Et Il m'a ignoré.
J'ai demandé l'appui de députés,
le député Watkins et d'autres,
pour financer ces programmes
avec l'accord d'Annapolis.
De façon incroyable, ces fonds n'ont pas
été réclamés par cette administration.
Mentionner ceci maintenant
est peut-être malvenu.
Je ne sais pas.
Je sais juste que c'est vrai.
Au vu de ces vérités,
je demande aux électeurs
de cette ville
d'envisager un changement.
Je vous en prie.
Pas d'applaudissements
avant la fin de la séance
de questions.
Maire Royce ?
Plus de surprises, hein ?
Je ne suis pas informé
des détails de l'incident
que le M. Carcetti évoque.
Je ne peux donc pas
y répondre directement.
Néanmoins,
je peux affirmer que cette ville
accorde la plus grande importance
à protéger les citoyens
qui sont prêts à témoigner,
et elle continuera à le faire.
M. Carcetti dit avoir écrit une lettre
exprimant ses inquiétudes,
et je suis sûr que c'est le cas.
Voyons, c'est...
C'est simple d'écrire des lettres
quand c'est tout ce qu'on a à faire.
Mais quand vous devez
gérer une ville,
avec des fonds limités,
et définir des priorités,
alors vous comprenez
qu'écrire des lettres
ne résoudra pas le problème.
Tu sais bien que je viendrai.
J'ai besoin d'un break.
Rien de pire que ces salopes
avec leurs ongles à la con,
à la table de black-jack...
Tu le sais bien.
Quitte pas.
Tu croyais que mon fils n'irait pas
à l'école
habillé comme ça lui plaît ?
Nous ne contrôlerons pas le crime
sans d'abord contrôler les écoles.
On doit penser à ces gamins
avant que la rue
ne s'en empare.
Et cela implique
de se recentrer sur nos écoles...
La prochaine fois que tu finis
le paquet, t'es prié de prévenir.
Hé, voilā Omar.
Il est lā.
Omar arrive.
Vous avez pas "miel et noix" ?
Tout est lā.
Et une cartouche de Newport.
Attention, le voilā.
Omar se pointe.
Ils ont pas "miel et noix" ?
- J'en veux męme pas, mon pote.
- Pourquoi ?
C'est pas ce que tu prends,
c'est ā qui tu le prends, tu piges ?
Comment tu veux hurler
avec les loups la nuit,
si tu passes la journée
ā jouer avec des chiots ?
SUR ÉCOUTE
"J'adore le premier jour.
Tout le monde est sympa".
- Alors tu restes fidčle ā Royce ?
- Comment įa ?
Įa se comprend,
tu as eu ta dose de Carcetti.
Ils ont planté ces trucs
sur chaque pelouse du quartier.
Ils les ramčnent plus vite
que je les enlčve.
C'est comme įa qu'il s'y prennent.
Je vois que tu es de congé.
Je bosse deux nuits
et trois jours par semaine,
et j'ai pas de week-end.
Je travaille pas avant cet aprčs-midi.
Et įa te plaît ?
Įa vaut pas le poste chez Hopkins,
mais je fais avec.
J'ai 52 000 par an, des avantages,
une voiture de fonction.
Le gérant de l'hôtel est
un vrai connard, mais bon.
Si tu as un peu de temps,
j'ai entendu quelque chose.
Ce truc au département d'études sociales
de l'Université du Maryland.
- Ils ont une bourse. Plein d'argent.
- Arręte.
Un demi-million pour surveiller
des délinquants récidivistes.
Étude clinique,
tout le tremblement.
Ils vont étudier des options ?
Melvin, j'ai eu ma dose de ces gens,
costard-cravate,
pleins de bonnes intentions,
sortis de la fac.
Tu es sûr ?
Parce que je leur en ai déjā parlé.
Bunny, tu es connu sur le campus.
Tu es le flic qui l'a légalisé.
Les étudiants ont adoré.
Ils sont bien les seuls.
J'aurai essayé.
En effet.
C'est mon gars, non ?
Il fait pas l'aumône, il travaille.
Tu piges ?
Ce Black est pas
comme les autres ici.
Du calme, mon gars.
On vient pour causer.
Tu te débrouilles bien
dans ce coin.
T'es sacrément débrouillard.
C'est quoi ton nom déjā ?
Boney ? Bitty ?
- Vas-y, c'est quoi ?
- Tu connais mon nom.
Ouais, mais je vais te dire :
avec le coin arrangé comme įa,
on le veut, tu piges ?
- Quoi ?
- Deux options :
tu peux prendre notre produit
ou tu peux dégager.
Chris viendra te voir, d'accord ?
Dis-lui ce qui doit ętre dit.
Je veux en savoir plus
sur ce gamin.
Je le sens bien, lui.
Des grosses pattes
sur un chiot, hein ?
Ouais, des grosses pattes
sur un chiot.
Trčs juste.
En vérité, nous ne savons pas
pourquoi il a été tué.
C'est peut-ętre
parce qu'il était témoin,
mais peut-ętre pas.
Celui qui a balancé įa ā Carcetti
- a menti.
- Bon, c'est bien.
Huit points...
Ā peu prčs ce que Carcetti récupčre.
Il veut qu'on compare nos bites ?
Il sera pas de taille contre moi.
Il faut faire passer le message :
le premier qui joue
sur les deux tableaux
ne profitera pas
de mon prochain mandat.
- Plus de culs entre deux chaises.
- Trčs bien.
Ensuite, je veux que
les services municipaux
déchirent toutes les affiches
de Carcetti aujourd'hui.
Sur chaque lampadaire, terre-plein,
bâtiment municipal.
Si le propriétaire de la maison
ne s'y oppose pas,
- on déchire.
- Ce sera fait.
Je veux les flics de la circulation
devant le QG de Carcetti.
Ā la moindre petite infraction,
stationnement non payé,
- contrôle technique, ā la fourričre.
- C'est bon.
Ensuite, vous deux...
vous calmez le jeu.
Rien d'autre ne sort sur ce meurtre
avant la fin des primaires.
Et je veux que vous deux...
vous alliez voir la presse pour
faire taire cette histoire de témoin.
Vous ętes responsables,
quelle que soit l'issue.
Clarence, je cours ā ma perte
en vous soutenant.
Įa ira mieux
si je vous sors de ma liste ?
Bien, ce sera tout.
Merci, messieurs.
Au boulot.
M. le maire ?
- Quoi ?
- Carcetti a raison.
Je suis allé ā Annapolis,
des fonds ont été alloués
pour la protection des témoins.
Vous n'avez pas affecté un centime
au programme.
- L'année fiscale prochaine.
- Pas la carte de la pauvreté.
Il ne s'agit que
d'un quart de million.
Si j'assigne ces fonds maintenant,
ce connard de Carcetti
aura le clou de sa campagne :
"Tommy Carcetti étend le programme
de protection des témoins".
"Il se bat et obtient
des fonds supplémentaires".
Pas question !
Je m'occuperai d'assigner cet argent
aprčs les élections.
Non, j'ai payé pour trois pilules.
Écoute, en bleu, c'est deux.
- Non, moi, c'est deux.
- En blanc, c'est une.
- Putain de tricheur.
- J'en veux quatre.
Écoute, en bleu, c'est deux.
Blanc, c'est une. Torse nu, c'est une.
Soit vous prenez
ce que vous avez payé,
soit vous partez sans rien.
Pas de remboursement.
Non, mon gars, j'ai en payé trois.
Réfléchis bien ā ce qui va t'arriver
si tu me touches.
Vous pouvez remercier votre pote
de vous avoir volé votre trip.
Attends, attends,
je peux en avoir deux ?
Įa, c'est du bon boulot.
T'en fais pas des tonnes.
Si tu viens sous mon aile, petit,
tu vas plus t'arręter de monter.
Je comprends pas
pourquoi tu penses ā t'arręter.
Écoute,
comme je te l'ai déjā dit...
J'ai l'argent qu'il me faut
et demain, c'est la rentrée.
Mais putain,
qu'est-ce tu vas foutre ā l'école ?
Tu veux ętre quoi, un astronaute ?
Un dentiste ? Un avocat black ?
Écoute bien.
Et si tu venais ici aprčs l'école
pour bosser pour moi ?
Qu'est-ce que t'en dis ?
C'est super. Merci.
Je sais qu'une telle somme...
Je disais qu'une telle somme
n'est pas facile ā réunir.
Non, įa vient de mon côté.
Des travaux, je crois...
Entendu.
Trčs bien.
Merci encore.
Deux heures, 30 000 $.
Qui a dit que je savais pas
m'y prendre ?
C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
C'est la ville qui refait le trottoir
juste devant notre porte.
Tu l'as bien énervé.
Oui, on dirait bien.
En route. Porte ā porte ā Irvington.
- C'est parti.
- Et il y a le témoin mort ce soir.
C'est une fédérale ?
Non, c'est pas une fédérale.
C'est une nana de la ville.
Je l'aime bien, cette petite.
Elle est cool.
Tant qu'elle se met pas
en travers de ma route.
Une réappro juste lā.
L'école commence que demain,
c'est įa ?
La petite a mis son uniforme
pour rien.
Tu l'as compris aussi, hein, petite ?
La caméra ?
Si tu passes par-devant, ils vont...
Ils sauront que c'est moi.
C'est ma marque.
Mais s'ils te reconnaissent...
Quoi, t'as peur d'ętre pris ?
Tu voudrais peut-ętre le faire
déguisé en Bugs Bunny ?
Un lapin de 1,80 m pointant
un pistolet sur leur gueule.
Un paquet de Juicy Fruit.
On dirait que vous ętes
moitié café, moitié chinoise.
Du Vięt-nam ou d'un truc comme įa.
Revenez nous voir, Mama-san.
Patience, petite.
Sois plus patiente.
Le gars conduit une voiture de merde,
il a un magasin ā deux sous,
mais la porte de derričre
est en acier renforcé
et la caméra de sécurité sur la rue
est du dernier cri.
En plus, je crois que j'ai assisté
ā la réappro aujourd'hui.
Une écoličre
avec un sac ā dos chargé.
J'ai sorti les appels André,
essayant de trouver
l'organisation de Marlo,
en traįant le croisement
des appels entre portables.
C'est Fruit. Įa, c'est Monk,
et trois ou quatre autres
dont je suis presque sûr.
On va pas trouver la ligne directe
vers Marlo comme įa.
André doit passer par Monk
pour le joindre.
Non. Mais on pourrait remonter
jusqu'ā Chris Partlow,
ou un livreur
ou un lieutenant de Marlo.
On se rapproche.
Le préfet me demande.
Vous préparez pas un coup, j'espčre ?
Heureusement qu'il était pas
ā la mer aujourd'hui.
Et les assignations ?
Vous ne verrez plus aucun article
jusqu'ā la fin des primaires.
Aprčs, si un article sort
et qu'il n'y a plus personne
pour le lire,
qu'est-ce que le maire et son équipe
en auront ā foutre ?
Rien d'autre ā part įa,
sauf qu'il faut remettre cette unité
dans la rue, ā sa juste place.
Lieutenant, je vous relčve du
commandement de l'unité Anti-Crime.
Vous avez fait un excellent travail,
c'est pourquoi nous voulons
que vous amélioriez les performances
d'un autre aspect vital
de notre mission.
L'unité des appels téléphoniques.
Présentez-vous lā-bas
demain ā 8h00.
J'ai fait quelque chose de mal ?
Le lieutenant Marimow prendra
le relais ā l'Anti-Crime.
Si vous avez besoin de le briefer,
faites-le maintenant.
Jimmy, įa avance
cette maison sur la plage ?
La plage... Bien, monsieur.
Parfait. C'est parfait.
Tu peux me donner la passoire ?
Il est en avance.
Va ouvrir. Je vais le faire.
Entre.
- Įa sent bon.
- Des spaghettis. Trčs simple.
Ouais, le sommelier derričre
le Plexiglas a dit qu'il était sec.
- Salut, Beadie.
- Salut, Bunk, comment va ?
Regarde-moi įa.
Tu es blonde maintenant.
- Tu aimes ?
- Oui.
Salut, les enfants.
Voilā Jack, Cary.
C'est l'inspecteur Moreland.
- Appelez-moi Bunk.
- Je vais ouvrir le vin.
Ouais.
Laisse respirer cette merde.
Je suis désolé.
- Ils ont entendu pire.
- C'est sûr.
Tu veux des glaįons dans le tien ?
Non, c'est du vin de valeur.
- Il a męme un bouchon en ličge.
- Super.
DIRECTIVES ANTI-TERRORISTES
FÉDÉRALES
J'aime bien vos classeurs.
McNulty nous les a donnés.
Pas Jimmy ?
Oncle Jimmy ? Jim ?
Papa ?
Juste McNulty.
Si je prends sa dope ā deux balles,
įa signifie que je vais faire
moins d'argent.
La seule chose qui fait vivre ce coin,
c'est la bonne came
que vous me donnez.
Je me tenais lā comme un trou du cul
la queue entre les jambes,
parce que j'avais pas de renforts.
Merde.
Dans le bon vieux temps...
Tu sais, le problčme
avec le bon vieux temps...
c'est qu'il est vieux.
Les gens avec qui je travaille
en ce moment...
Tu veux te friter
avec Marlo pour du territoire ?
T'es tout seul.
Mais si tu veux un conseil...
J'en veux pas.
Bodie.
Moi ? J'ai perdu le marché
du gros ā Winchester.
Ces ânes prennent
la came de Marlo maintenant.
Il récupčre aussi les indépendants
sur Hilltop.
J'ai perdu trois équipes lā-bas
ce mois-ci.
Et dans les quartiers est ?
Lā-bas, on a un plus gros problčme :
toutes ces sales putes
en casquette des Yankee
chassent les locaux.
Les gars de New York auraient
fait fuir les gars de Delroy,
et ceux qui restent
doivent prendre leur matos.
Toute cette théorie
comme quoi c'est le produit,
pas le territoire ?
Tu peux pas dire įa
si un négro te pique tout le territoire
et veux pas prendre ton produit.
Marlo en prend qu'une petite partie.
Mais ces rats de New York,
ils sont ā l'échelle industrielle.
Moi, je pense qu'il est temps
qu'ils rentrent chez eux.
Si on se frotte ā eux,
c'est tous ensemble.
J'aimerais bien voir Marlo
avec nous sur ce coup-lā.
Vous me suivez ?
Tout Baltimore jouant en équipe.
Ouais, Marlo sait faire disparaître
les mecs gęnants,
pas vrai ?
On m'a dit qu'il était en cheville
avec les pompes funčbres
de Westport.
Le cercueil rentre,
il a besoin de deux porteurs.
Quand il sort, il en faut huit
pour porter ce machin.
Vous me suivez ?
Il utilise les maisons abandonnées
condamnées.
Il largue un cadavre dedans, įa fait pas
une grosse différence d'odeur.
Quoi qu'il fasse, il est dur,
mais il est pas stupide.
Il est temps de réessayer
de causer avec le garįon.
J'espčre que tu as un meilleur
baratin que Stringer.
Le jeunot a pręté l'oreille
ā personne jusqu'ici.
Merde, Jimmy,
tu t'es fait domestiquer.
Ouais, je crois bien.
Ouais, on est bien.
Comment įa se passe sur le port ?
- Tranquille.
- Comme partout. Męme ā l'ouest.
Įa me dérange.
Il y a un truc qui cloche.
Profites-en tant que įa dure.
- Tu travailles sur un truc ?
- Ouais, j'ai une affaire.
Je sais qui est le tireur,
mais je le trouve pas.
Il va se montrer.
- Peut ętre.
- Je te ressers ?
Pitié. Non, merci.
Un dessert ?
On pourrait sortir
pour une petite dégustation.
Ā moins que tu doives
coucher les enfants.
- Je sais pas.
- C'est bon, Jimmy. Vas-y.
Je vais les coucher.
Elle te fait confiance.
Je peux pas dîner
sans me faire biper. Alors ?
Son client prend une douche.
Elle fouille son portefeuille.
Il s'en rend compte et la dérouille
jusqu'ā ce que les gens d'ā côté
appellent la réception.
Monsieur, si elle a pas
l'argent sur elle,
je vois pas ce que je peux faire.
Avez-vous battu cette femme ?
Je veux juste récupérer mon argent.
Excusez-moi, M. Gergen.
Il me faut un instant
avec mon chef de la sécurité.
Si elle porte plainte,
je menotte ce connard.
M. Colvin, c'est délicat.
Foutaises.
M. Gergen représente
un consortium national
d'organisateurs de conventions.
Et c'est un vieil ami de l'hôtel...
M. Colvin ?
Alors, t'as pris son fric
et il t'a battue, c'est įa ?
Il t'a battue pour combien ?
Combien ?
Donnez-moi les menottes.
Non, M. Colvin.
C'est quoi, cette merde ?
Elle vole mon argent
et vous allez me coffrer ?
Vous allez ętre inculpé
pour agression.
Si vous portez plainte pour le vol,
je lui passerai les menottes aussi.
- Mais vous, c'est le fourgon, merdeux.
- M. Colvin, ce n'est pas acceptable.
Il part dans un fourgon.
M. Colvin, je dois insister.
30 ans de police
sans jamais fermer les yeux
sur un délit.
Įa va pas commencer maintenant.
Vous n'ętes pas officier de police,
M. Colvin.
Vous travaillez pour nous.
Non, c'est bon pour moi.
Tu bichonnes ce truc
comme un petit oiseau.
Tu connais les petites échoppes
dans les coins de rue du ghetto,
qui vendent des sandwiches, du poulet
grillé et de la truite d'eau douce ?
De la truite d'eau douce ?
C'est comme les ufs
ā la crčme de New York.
- Pas d'ufs, pas de crčme.
- Exactement.
Pas d'eau douce et pas de truites.
Ce sont des harengs.
Des merlans, des poissons pourris.
Exactement. Des poissons pourris.
"Truite d'eau douce".
C'est du marketing.
C'est vendu pour ce que ce n'est pas.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
Des fois,
c'est pas juste une apparence.
C'est la vérité.
C'est profond.
J'aime ta faįon de penser.
Oui, moi aussi.
Attends.
Si tu peux faire le nud
d'une chaussure, tu peux faire l'autre.
Tu m'entends ?
T'as du gâteau partout.
Viens.
Quoi de neuf ?
Pręt pour le premier jour ?
Il est impatient d'ętre en CE2.
Pas vrai, Bug ?
Quoi de neuf ?
Regardez-moi ces gros costauds
de troisičme.
On dirait que les gosses de sixičme
vont se faire cogner.
Entrez. Je veux vous montrer
quelque chose.
Avance, Bug.
Ce maillot, c'est de la balle.
T'as eu įa oų ?
Regarde įa.
Un gars en prison avec mon pčre
a dessiné įa.
Je me le mettrai sur le bras.
C'est toi ? Pourquoi te mettre
le visage sur le bras ?
Si t'oublies ā quoi tu ressembles ?
Įa veut dire quoi ?
Celui-lā veut dire "cur",
comme pour : "Il a du cur".
Įa veut dire "lion".
Comment tu sais įa ?
Peut-ętre qu'il se fout de toi.
Celui-lā, au lieu de "cur",
įa peut vouloir dire "pute".
Et celui-lā, c'est peut-ętre
"pédale" ou "guignol".
Arręte.
Allez vous faire foutre, connards.
- C'est sûrement įa.
- Sortez de chez moi.
Vous devez comprendre
une chose.
Je suis peut-ętre gradé,
mais j'ai bossé dur pour įa,
et je suis avant tout,
et je resterai, policier.
Je me suis gelé les couilles en hiver,
j'ai sué en été, couru, sauté,
j'ai poursuivi des truands 24 heures sur 24,
sept jours sur sept, 365 jours pas an.
Je suis un fan de cette unité.
Avon Barksdale ? C'est un sacré
gros coup que vous avez assuré.
Mais nous allons faire encore mieux.
Si nous devons résoudre une affaire,
nous le ferons ensemble.
Avec du travail efficace,
efficacement supervisé.
Je veux ętre tenu au courant
ā chaque étape.
Des questions ?
Bien.
Tu as qui ?
J'ai... "Prez"... Quoi ?
J'ai Mme Scott,
je hais cette sale pute.
Elle est pas si terrible.
Au moins, t'as pas Sampson.
Ouais, je sais.
Michael, t'as qui, toi ?
Presborowski ? Prez...
Il est blanc et nouveau.
C'est du tout cuit.
Regardez-moi įa.
Oų est ta belle voiture de fonction ?
Elle a plus de fonction.
On doit parler.
Les sixičmes au premier étage.
Les cinquičmes au second.
Les quatričmes
au troisičme étage.
Ne montez pas par l'escalier
pour descendre.
Dans le calme, les enfants.
Je te vois, Quantell.
Je vous vois aussi.
Les cours vont bientôt
commencer, allez !
Bonjour, ma chčre.
Contente de te revoir.
Įa va, Turner ?
T'es lā pour de bon ?
Bordel.
J'adore le premier jour.
Tout le monde est sympa.
Namond Brice.
Įa commence déjā ?
Fais chier.
La prochaine fois,
ils restent dans mon tiroir.
Ouais, c'est įa.
Comme si je savais pas.
On est des cinquičmes.
T'as vu Neesy ?
Ces salopes prennent
des stéroïdes.
Il faut les envoyer en Iran.
Tout serait réglé en deux minutes.
Regardez le plan de classe
pour voir oų vous ętes assis.
Regardez le plan de classe.
Salut, je m'appelle Randy.
Comment įa va, Randy ?
Regardez le plan de classe.
Bonjour.
Vos gueules !
Comme vous le voyez,
je suis votre professeur.
Je m'appelle M. Pryzbylewski.
Mais vous pouvez m'appeler
M. Pryzbylewski.
Bien, faisons connaissance.
Ici Mme Donnelly.
La sonnerie a un problčme.
Le changement de classe
devrait ętre sonné dans une minute.
Les élčves vont marcher, et non courir,
vers les classes, en rangs.
Nous ferons connaissance
un peu plus tard.
Pardon. Excusez-moi.
Pardon.
Oų est ma carte de bus ?
Crystal Judkins,
tu n'es pas sur la liste.
Crystal ?
J'ai l'air d'ętre Crystal ?
Je suis Charlene.
Ronald Parker ?
Karim Williams.
Ronald est lā-bas.
Bon sang.
M. Prez, j'ai besoin du laissez-passer
pour les toilettes.
C'est urgent.
Je vais récupérer
toutes les cartes de bus.
Attendez, tout le monde.
Restez ā votre place.
Il me faut les cartes.
C'est urgent, M. Prez...
Je dois récupérer les cartes de bus
pour les enfants qui en ont besoin...
- M. Prez...
- Quoi ?
Prends-en un.
J'ai besoin des cartes.
Personne ne sort d'ici
avant que M. Pryzbylewski
ait récupéré ses cartes.
Faut-il que je me répčte ?
Vous allez y arriver.
Entrez.
Vous entrez, oui ou non ?
Je vais entrer.
Vous vouliez me voir ?
En effet.
J'aime bien connaître
mes hommes en profondeur.
Pourquoi vouliez-vous cette unité ?
Honnętement ?
J'ai passé le test de sergent,
j'ai fait un score assez élevé,
mais pas assez.
Avec le Lieutenant Hoskins,
on était ā l'académie ensemble.
Il a dit que c'était
une bonne affectation
pour grimper les échelons.
Je sais qu'il faut rester un moment,
mais peut-ętre que l'année prochaine,
si je fais du bon boulot,
ils penseront ā moi.
L'année prochaine ?
Įa fait longtemps ā attendre.
Pardon ?
Je sais que vous ętes un bon flic.
Je sais aussi que vous savez
reconnaître vos amis
et ętre loyal envers eux.
Est-ce que j'ai bon ?
Absolument.
Oų ętes-vous dans la liste ?
32. Ils en ont pris 15, mais...
Je pensais que vous alliez dire
quelque chose comme 60,
ou męme 95.
Laissez-moi appeler
ce bon Burrell.
On va pas gâcher le talent
de flics comme vous
ā jouer les chauffeurs
pour des politiciens.
Je ne sais pas quoi dire,
M. le maire.
Je ne m'y attendais pas.
N'en parlons pas.
Aujourd'hui, c'est le premier jour,
alors on va s'amuser un peu.
Je vais vous poser
un petit problčme de maths,
pour vous remettre
les idées en place.
André part de Baltimore...
M. Prezbo, je dois changer de place.
Ce garįon a une odeur de poubelle.
Je crois que tu devrais
travailler ta compassion.
Et lui, il devrait travailler
le savon et l'eau.
Bon, comme je disais,
mon ami André part de Baltimore.
Il roule ā 100 km/h...
Quel côté de Baltimore ?
Est ou ouest ?
Įa n'a pas d'importance.
C'est ce que vous croyez.
D'accord. Est.
Ouest, c'est bon ?
Et il va ā Philadelphie.
Įa pue la merde, lā-bas.
Allen Iverson,
c'est de la merde ?
- Arrętez.
- Il joue pour eux. Il est pas de lā-bas.
Je jouerai jamais pour les Sixers,
peu importe le fric.
Ils te paieraient
pour que tu dégages.
Įa suffit !
André part de Baltimore,
Baltimore ouest.
Il roule ā 100 km/h.
Il va ā Philadelphie,
qui est ā 130 km.
Quel genre de voiture ?
S'il roule sur la 95, il devrait
faire gaffe ā la police État
Ils recherchent les Blacks.
Il a pas dit André était noir.
Randy. "André" ?
Des quartiers ouest ?
- Il a pas dit qu'il était noir.
- Tu sais qu'il est noir.
C'est bon !
M. Prezbo. Vous dites
qu'il voyage en voiture.
Il conduit ou il est sur le sičge arričre ?
Vous savez quoi ?
Les plaisanteries les plus...
Ā vos places !
Tout le monde, assis !
Tout va bien ici ?
Pourquoi l'officier Massey
n'est pas présente ?
Elle a travaillé toute la nuit
sur les écoutes.
La présence aux réunions
est désormais obligatoire.
Dites-le lui.
Ce Marlo Stanfield ?
C'est tout ce qu'on peut faire ?
- Pardon ?
- C'est celui
qui nous fait perdre
notre temps depuis des mois ?
On pourrait faire plein
d'autres choses dans les rues.
Stanfield est prometteur.
Il tient une bonne partie
des quartiers ouest.
Combien de morts ā son actif ?
Il a gagné une guerre
contre les Barksdale l'an dernier,
il en a quelques-uns,
mais rien de récent.
Rien de récent ?
Il tient tout Baltimore ouest
sans faire de morts ?
C'est peut-ętre moi,
mais en 18 ans,
je n'ai jamais vu un carnivore
manger des carottes.
Il est calme depuis quelque temps.
Cette ville croule sous les cadavres
et vous bossez sur les antécédents
d'un seul type ?
Bien, voilā la nouvelle donne.
Je veux des coups de filet
rapides et efficaces.
Six, 10, 12 affaires par mois.
Įa veut dire : plus de conneries
d'écoutes, plus d'assignations,
plus d'enculage de mouches.
On retourne dans les rues,
on revient avec des chiffres.
L'affaire Barksdale est close.
Et les écoutes sur Stanfield
ne seront plus prolongées,
l'affaire sera close aussi.
Compris ?
Mais c'est quoi, ce bordel ?
On a une écoute et un juge décide
quand c'est terminé.
Eh bien, Inspecteur,
le sous-préfet a prévu
d'en parler avec vous.
Ā la table B, rangez ces cartes.
Kareem Myers. Assis.
Écoutez.
Kit Kat, 1 $,
Snickers, 1 $,
Warheads, 1 $,
Twizzlers, 1 $.
Bonbons acides, 50 cents,
chewing-gums, 50 cents.
Tout ce qu'il y a au magasin,
je peux vous l'avoir.
Des nounours ?
Sans problčme.
J'ai des Snickers, M&M's.
Regardez les prix
et revenez me voir.
Trois pour le prix de deux.
Et je prends les commandes
pour demain.
Je serai lā demain.
Si vous voulez un truc spécial,
venez me voir.
Et voilā.
Pourquoi pas un pistolet ā eau ?
Renaldo, souviens-toi
de ce qu'on doit faire.
Įa va le faire.
Gordo. La caisse.
Avec ta merde, lā ?
T'es fou ou quoi ?
Loco ou quoi ?
Tu sais pas que c'est blindé ?
Tu comprends pas...
T'as entendu ce qu'il t'a dit.
Et un paquet de Newport.
Et ma monnaie ?
Me fâche pas.
T'as vu la gueule qu'il faisait ?
Voilā pourquoi on se lčve
tous les matins.
Yvonne, l'amie André
est censée le rencontrer
ā Philadelphie.
André va baiser cette pute.
La ferme, s'il te plaît ?
M. Prezbo essaye de nous expliquer.
Ta gueule, salope.
Il m'apprend rien.
Yvonne, elle, arrive de New York.
Ma question est donc...
A, qui est arrivé le premier ?
André ou Yvonne ?
Et B, en combien de temps ?
Et C... Qui įa intéresse ?
Avec cet argent, le but
n'est pas seulement de repenser
la faįon d'utiliser les institutions,
mais aussi de dépasser la prison
et les cures de désintox
comme seules réponses.
Nous cherchons un groupe
précis ā inoculer,
d'un point de vue épidémiologique...
Docteur, pardonnez-moi.
Je ne suis pas un universitaire.
Pas du tout, męme.
Mais que voulez-vous dire,
exactement ?
Il dit qu'il a plein d'argent
pour trouver un moyen
de sortir ces gamins
qui se shootent dans les rues.
C'est exactement įa.
Et oų j'entre en jeu ?
Si la rémunération vous convient,
votre mission sera d'ętre
un chercheur de terrain.
Notre liaison
dans l'environnement urbain.
Tu iras dans le ghetto
attraper des gamins de la rue
pour l'expérience.
Voilā pourquoi j'ai besoin
de quelqu'un comme vous
ā mes côtés.
Si j'y vais tout seul...
Ils vendront votre dépouille
en pičces détachées.
On peut le dire ainsi.
Bref, nous cherchons
des gens de 18 ā 21 ans.
Lā oų on constate un pic
dans le comportement violent.
Vous nous excusez une minute ?
Et quand tu seras pas lā
pour traduire ?
Joue pas ā l'idiot avec moi, Bunny.
Tu sais dialoguer avec ce genre
de types. Je t'ai vu travailler.
De plus, il est clair
que tu n'es pas fait pour le privé.
De 18 ā 21 ans ?
Ā cet âge, ils sont irrécupérables.
Il est foutu lā-dessus.
Montre-lui.
50 000, une mutuelle ā 80%
et une voiture de fonction.
Je serais étonné s'il te donne 30 000,
une couverture médicale de base
et une carte de bus.
YVONNE GAGNE
AVEC 30 MINUTES D'AVANCE
PREZBO, JE T'EMMERDE
Ā plus tard.
Si j'y vais,
tu sais ce que įa fait de moi ?
Un enculé de politicard
qui se présente aux élections.
Watkins, du 40e district.
T'as prévenu les journalistes ?
Les trois chaînes et le "Sun".
Mes condoléances.
Je suis Thomas...
Je sais qui vous ętes.
Merci d'ętre venu.
Je suis vraiment navré.
Nous ne devrions pas ętre ici
seulement parce que votre fils
a accepté de témoigner.
Que voulez-vous dire ?
Je sais que...
Je suis vraiment désolé.
C'est tout.
C'est le pire cauchemar d'un parent.
Je sais pas comment
on peut continuer aprčs įa.
Moi non plus.
Mlle Daniels.
Monsieur.
Comment įa se passe
dans le 11e district ?
Plus dur que je n'imaginais.
Męme avec le soutien du maire.
Oui, Eunetta est bien ancrée.
Bonne chance ā vous.
Le conseil aurait bien
besoin de vous.
M. Carcetti,
vous nous accordez une minute ?
Monsieur, par ici.
Une déclaration.
Écoutez, je suis désolé.
Ce n'est pas le bon moment.
Je n'ai pas grand-chose ā dire.
- Je suis désolé.
- Il plaisante ?
Pourquoi ils nous ont fait venir ?
Tu refuses cette publicité ?
T'as perdu la tęte ?
On passera au JT de 23h00
juste avec les images.
Mais si je fais un speech
ici et maintenant...
de quoi j'aurai l'air ?
La mise en scčne est plutôt minable.
Eh bien, įa dépend du public.
Voici Shawn Williams.
Lieutenant Mello,
veuillez appeler le chef de quart.
Patron, vous voulez que je reste ?
Non, c'est bon.
Donc, Shawn...
T'es flic... pas lui.
Shawn, quel âge as-tu ?
18 ans. Et toi, quel âge tu as,
enculé de tęte d'uf ?
Tu as une sur, Shawn ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ā ma soeur ?
Et il écrit quoi,
cet enculé de face de rat ?
Disons que tu apprends
que ta sur a été agressée...
Qui a emmerdé ma sur ?
Personne. C'est une image.
Une image de quoi ?
Pourquoi tu m'embrouilles
la tęte, enculé ?
Et ce con écrit encore.
C'est une habitude.
Que ferais-tu si tu apprenais
que ta sur a été battue ?
Quelle sur ?
Si c'est Cherise,
elle le méritait sûrement.
Une autre sur, alors.
Danielle ? Je nique le type.
Je le déglingue.
Et si t'es en prison ?
Mon gars le fera pour moi.
Et si tu n'as pas de gars ?
Alors je tuerai le salaud en sortant.
Si tu es en prison ā vie ?
Je m'échappe.
Et pose ce putain de stylo
avant que je te l'enfonce dans le cul !
Et si tu pouvais pas t'échapper,
Shawn ?
Je t'emmerde.
Je t'emmerde.
Tu le dirais ā la police ?
C'était juste une question.
Mon garįon,
merci d'ętre qui tu es.
Je suis pręt ā reconnaître
que les 18-21 sont
sans doute trop imprégnés.
Et si tu nous trouvais des jeunes ?
Maintenant ? J'en ai plus.
Le fourgon du centre pour ados
vient de partir.
Vous cherchez
des gamins dans le systčme ?
Ou juste des gamins ?
Si c'est įa,
il y a Douglas au coin de la rue.
L'école débute cette semaine.
Le lycée ? Įa fait quoi ?
De 15 ā 18 ans ?
Oui, mais je descendrais encore.
Kima, salut, ma belle.
Vous ętes sûre ?
C'est moi qui vous ai sortie
du district est
pour jouer dans la cour des grands.
Vous pouvez pas revenir,
vous ętes trop bonne pour un district.
J'ai besoin d'une maison,
commandant.
Essayez de progresser vers le haut,
ou au moins latéralement.
Mais dans un district, vous reculez.
Et vous n'avez pas besoin
de ma protection.
Vous serez appréciée
oų que vous alliez.
Je vais faire jouer mes relations.
J'ai grandement apprécié le timing
pour l'envoi des papiers.
Malin.
Je ne pensais pas
qu'on nous arręterait.
Pas avec les élections.
Quel idiot risquerait
les gros titres ?
Mais nous faire gicler de l'intérieur...
Charlie Marimow,
mon cheval de Troie.
Laissez-moi deviner.
Pour sauver vos écoutes,
vous iriez jusqu'au juge Davis.
Si j'ai bonne mémoire,
ce n'est pas la premičre fois
qu'un sous-préfet veut votre peau.
Vous ętes voué au martyre.
Mais vos disciples accepteraient
de monter aussi sur la croix ?
Dans votre rapport final pour la cour,
il serait prudent de dire au juge
que l'enquęte a fini en impasse.
Je doute que vous me croyiez,
mais...
je respecte votre travail.
Vous ętes un sacré enquęteur.
Ce serait trop vous demander de servir
sous le lieutenant Marimow ?
Ce type est un virus.
La Criminelle, alors.
Įa vous correspond, non ?
Je sais que c'est dur,
Inspecteur, mais...
prenez įa comme une faveur.
Įa semble bien.
Mon ancienne unité est dirigée
par le lieutenant Marimow.
Oui, en effet.
Donc cette unité est...
- Oui, en effet.
- Quelle honte.
Je voudrais vous demander
une faveur pour ma petite Greggs.
C'est un bon flic,
ā la recherche d'un toit.
Elle serait ā sa place ā la Criminelle.
Il y avait bien une place.
Mais elle est prise depuis hier soir.
Un autre échappé
de l'unité Anti-Crime.
Mais pour vous, Commandant,
je vais voir qui je n'aime plus.
Si une fusée voyage
ā 1 500 km ā l'heure,
quelle distance
fera-t-elle en une heure ?
Darnell ?
Chiquan ?
Aussi loin qu'elle veut.
C'est une fusée, non ?
Randy ?
C'est une question pičge ?
1 500 km ?
Dans le mille.
M. Prezbo, j'allais le dire.
Vas-y, connasse.
Fous-toi de ma gueule, maintenant.
Quoi ? T'en veux aussi ?
Reste au sol, pétasse.
Fous-toi de moi, maintenant.
J'entends rien.
Crystal, que l'accueil appelle
les secours et va chercher l'infirmičre.
Tout le monde ā sa place.
Ne bouge pas. Ne bouge pas.
Maintiens la pression dessus.
C'est trčs bien, Chiquan.
Encore quelques minutes.
Tout ira bien.
Tu m'as titillé toute la nuit.
Ce que je dois découvrir,
c'est si tu es pręt ŕ me bouffer
le cul en entier.
Moi, j'ai pas une montagne de fric
ŕ perdre.
Tout va bien pour toi.
Tu aimes les Town Car ?
Vous les jeunes,
c'est plutôt les Lexus
et ces putain de 4x4.
Et ces radios par satellite
ŕ la con.
Mais moi ?
J'aime bien ma Town Car.
Un homme a l'air tranquille
et respectable lŕ-dedans.
Je vais te dire,
si tu gagnes,
assure-toi
de t'en acheter une, fiston.
Que le spectacle commence.
Tourne-la, putain.
Il a une sacrée main.
Un de ces jours,
je sortirai d'ici en Rolls.
Vu les leçons qu'on te donne ici,
m'est d'avis que tu sortiras
avec Morgan Freeman
comme chauffeur.
Ŕ la prochaine.
Je suis ŕ l'épicerie sur Monroe.
Un dollar.
Putain !
Tu crois que bosser dans cette merde
un dimanche matin
me fait ręver ?
Que je parle ŕ tous mes amis
de mon super boulot ?
Je bosse pour ma famille.
Fais comme si je te parlais pas.
Fais comme si j'existais męme pas.
Je sais qui tu es.
Je me m'oppose pas ŕ toi,
mais je suis un homme.
Et toi, tu piques ce truc
et agis comme si j'étais pas lŕ.
En effet.
Je suis lŕ.
Je t'ai dit que
je m'opposais pas ŕ toi.
Je ne te manque pas de respect.
Tu veux que ça se passe comme ça.
Quoi ?
Tu veux que ça se passe comme ça.
Je sais pas...
Arręte.
Arręte de dire ça.
Mais ça se passe pas comme ça.
SUR ÉCOUTE
"Personne ne gagne.
Une équipe perd juste plus lentement".
Je te le dis.
Elle en avait que pour Chiquan.
Du genre,
"Rigole, salope !
Tu rigoles, salope ?
T'aimes ça ?
Tu veux que
je te coupe les tétons ?"
Putain, lâche-moi !
"Tu veux que je te taille
de la chatte au menton ?"
Allez, c'est bon.
Il a dit de le laisser,
alors laisse-le.
- Je fais que parler.
- Tu fais que parler.
Tu ne sais faire que ça, parler.
C'était un truc de malade.
Et alors ?
Son pčre... il a tué trois flics.
- Quoi ?
- Non, c'est vrai.
Son pčre a tué trois flics
et sa mčre fait bouillir des chats.
- Arręte un peu.
- Elle fait bouillir les chats
et les sert aprčs.
Elle les sert ŕ qui ?
Des enculés de mangeurs de chats ?
- Qui veut bouffer du chat bouilli ?
- Elle vit de ça, il paraît.
Toi, tu t'es fait bouillir.
Laetitia habite un de ces foyers
ŕ Edmonson.
Dans ces endroits,
pas besoin de manger des chats
pour te rendre fou.
Entraîneur !
Si le mec vient pas, vous pourriez
nous laisser le ring, ŕ Michael et moi.
Aucun de vous a vu Spider
aujourd'hui ?
Je l'ai pas vu.
Comment il va combattre
la semaine prochaine
s'il s'entraîne pas ?
Voilŕ ce qu'on va faire.
Jusqu'ŕ ce qu'il arrive,
tu peux mettre les gants
et tenter ta chance une fois.
Pas avec lui. Avec moi.
Je vais te montrer
aussi gentiment que possible
ŕ quel point tu ne sais rien.
Ton cul va y passer.
Tu vas te faire botter le cul.
Vous faites le sabbat ?
Restez un peu et vous me verrez
sermonner ces gosses.
Une gauche sacrée
et une droite sanctifiée.
Que faites-vous lŕ, un dimanche ?
Allez voir Mlle Donnelly
ŕ Tilghman Middle.
Elle a un emploi d'encadrement
qui vous irait.
Avec tous les avantages.
- Encadrement ?
- Allez la voir demain.
Elle expliquera mieux que moi.
Dites-moi une chose.
Comment vous faites
pour si bien savoir
oů chacun devrait ętre ?
Un bon homme d'église est toujours
impliqué dans les affaires de chacun.
C'est notre boulot.
Entraîneur, pręt ?
Qui gagne ?
Personne ne gagne.
Une équipe perd juste plus lentement.
Pourquoi on sortirait pas un peu ?
Faire une balade.
C'est une belle journée.
Je dois préparer un discours
que je dois donner...
sur ce qui s'est passé.
Une heure.
Je dois...
Je dois dire quelque chose
ŕ ces gamins.
Tu vois ?
Quelqu'un gagne.
Je t'attendais pas avant demain.
J'ai entendu que ma nouvelle équipe
bossait le week-end.
Et je me suis dit que
si j'emballais mes trucs
d'Anti-Crime un dimanche,
je croiserais pas
cet enculé de Marimow.
Marimow rejette brillamment le talent.
Il l'envoie au large avec force.
Freamon est arrivé vendredi.
Lester est un rapide.
Voilŕ le bureau du colonel.
Ici, mon humble demeure.
Le tableau.
Et par ici, ton bureau.
- C'est propre.
- Tu y remédieras.
Un bureau propre,
c'est le signe d'un esprit dérangé.
La Criminelle.
Merde.
Je sais pas oů est passée ta chaise.
Voilŕ ta premičre affaire.
Et pose ça, tu veux ?
Tu habites ici maintenant.
Regarde !
Du vrai travail de policier.
- Un de ceux-lŕ ?
- C'est lui, ici.
Il l'a mis sur la tęte de Fruit
et juste aprčs,
c'était Fruit par terre,
avec sa copine qui gueulait...
Et ce truc rose qui lui sortait de la tęte.
Bunk.
Bossant les week-ends.
Cet homme est dévoué.
Tu feras équipe avec Crutchfield
pour commencer.
Tu n'auras pas d'enquęte ŕ toi
les premiers mois.
Ça te laissera le temps
d'apprendre les bases.
Nos affaires de meurtres par années,
dépositions de témoins,
notre mausolée de cravates.
Le café...
Et les boîtes aux lettres,
par équipe et par escouade.
Lester.
Je crois que nos deux réfugiés
se connaissent bien.
Encore un peu paumée ici ?
Un peu, ouais.
Tu t'en sortiras bien.
Aussi tendre que soit ce moment,
Inspecteur, vous avez du courrier.
T'as déjŕ Lyon sur le dos ?
Un autre pétage de plombs
sur la sonde ŕ méthane.
J'appellerais ce numéro.
Débarrasse-toi de ça
avant de prendre une affaire.
Avec ou sans chaise.
C'est quoi,
une sonde ŕ méthane ?
Ici Kathleen O'Shea.
Oui, bonjour.
J'ai besoin de parler ŕ M. Lyon
ŕ propos des protocoles.
Pardon ?
M. Lyon, s'il vous plaît.
Tu m'as l'air un peu vieille
pour ça, chérie.
Pardon ? Qui est-ce ?
Ici Inspecteur Greggs de...
Ici le zoo de Baltimore.
Trčs bien.
Je suis l'inspecteur Greggs.
Et vous appelez
pour un certain M. Lion.
Je suis désolée.
J'ai fait un mauvais numéro.
Sonde ŕ méthane.
La tapette balafrée.
Je dois le chasser.
Y'a pas de protection
contre ce genre de merdes.
On peut rien prévoir avec ce mec.
Enfin, tu sais comment il est.
Il est comment ?
Comme un de ces enculés
de terroristes.
Il fait juste péter des trucs
comme ça.
Il se fout de qui est blessé
ou du sens que ça peut avoir.
Il a pas tort.
Et le gouvernement, hein ?
Si y'a une attaque terroriste,
ils sont compréhensifs
envers Delta et les autres.
Les assurances, les banques,
le Nasdaq et tout ça,
ils ont du temps pour tout rembourser,
car le gouvernement sait
qu'ils y pouvaient rien.
Je sais que tu captes.
Tu vois le problčme globalement.
Les Blacks de nos jours, ils voient
par le petit trou de la lorgnette.
C'est joli.
Quoi ?
Ça te plaît ?
Ça fait longtemps que je l'ai.
Ça a de la valeur sentimentale.
- C'est juste un truc.
- Quelle est sa vraie valeur ?
Sa vraie valeur ?
Je suis pas trop sentiments.
Tu sais,
ça fait longtemps
que je l'ai pas fait évaluer.
Avec la fluctuation de l'économie
globale et tout.
- Je la ferai évaluer pour toi.
- T'es pas obligé.
Je la ferai évaluer pour toi.
Mon doigt a gonflé avec les années.
- T'as besoin d'aide ?
- Ouais, besoin d'aide ?
Non, c'est bon.
- Peut-ętre avec de la salive.
- Je veux pas de sa salive.
C'est bon, je l'ai.
Omar est pas un terroriste.
Juste un Black de plus
avec un flingue.
Et t'es pas Delta Airlines non plus.
Juste un Black
qui s'est fait voler sa came.
Alors apporte ce que tu me dois
et va faire ton baratin
sur l'économie ailleurs.
Tu captes ?
J'ai une autre partie.
T'as déjŕ perdu combien ?
Faut de la patience
pour étudier leurs maničres.
Du fric aussi.
T'as besoin de combien cette fois ?
150 000, ça devrait le faire.
150 000 ?
J'aurai ce mec au nez de poulet
un de ces jours.
Je me ferai l'autre enflé aussi.
Je les aurai tous.
Sinon, si je m'ennuie, je t'enverrai.
Mon avis, colonel Foerster,
c'est que votre homme Norris
est en train de foutre le bordel.
Monsieur,
c'est une affaire prioritaire
et Norris pense qu'on a un meurtre
de témoin sur les bras.
On ne sait męme pas encore
si c'était le mobile du crime.
Voilŕ ce que je veux dire.
Norris est un pro.
Son taux de réussite
dit le contraire, colonel.
Norris est un bon flic.
Ray, on a besoin de quelqu'un
qui peut bosser dur,
pendant longtemps,
jusqu'ŕ ce que ça soit réglé.
Et il me semble que du sang neuf
vient d'arriver ŕ la Criminelle.
Une femme. Blessée en service
il y a quelques années.
Elle n'a jamais bossé
ŕ la Criminelle.
Un regard neuf.
Sauf votre respect,
si je garantis qu'il n'y aura pas d'autre fuite
ŕ la presse concernant cette enquęte,
en tout cas pas avant les élections,
pourrions-nous garder
un enquęteur chevronné dessus ?
Je n'aime pas ce que vous insinuez.
Mes excuses.
Tu me fais perdre du temps
ŕ venir ici.
Je te signale que ça nous coűte
de l'argent.
Comment te faire confiance
si tu continues ŕ mentir ?
Tu fais pas ce que tu dis.
J'ai juste manqué vendredi, c'est tout.
Écoute, tu dois y penser comme ça :
l'école, c'est un boulot.
Pour toi, c'est pareil.
Si tu sčches les cours, c'est comme
si tu te pointais pas au boulot.
J'ai déjŕ entendu, inventé et testé
toutes les excuses possibles.
Donc, ŕ part mort ou mourant,
tu n'as plus d'excuses.
J'ai dit que j'allais y aller.
Ouais, je sais.
L'école ou c'est fini, les affaires.
Tu vas y aller. Viens.
Prendre du retard n'est pas la meilleure
façon de commencer l'année,
surtout aprčs un arręt de trois ans.
On ne vous a pas vu
depuis votre inscription.
Quelque chose vous a empęché
de vous joindre ŕ nous ?
Je sais que vous avez fait
un geste pour Sherrod.
Je tiens ŕ m'excuser pour lui.
Il travaille dur pour m'aider
ŕ faire tourner une affaire.
Mais il doit ętre lŕ.
Personne n'en doute.
- Tout dépend de lui, non ?
- C'est ce que je dis.
Tout est lŕ.
Qu'en pensez-vous, jeune homme ?
Je suis d'accord.
Mais quelque chose me dérange,
cependant.
Sherrod a manqué
les trois derničres années.
Il devrait donc ętre encore
en CM2 ou en sixičme,
plutôt qu'avec ceux
de son âge, non ?
Pour pouvoir suivre les cours.
Passage automatique.
Excusez-moi ?
Nous n'avons plus les moyens
pour les redoublements
et mettre des enfants plus âgés
dans les petites classes
est ingérable pour les professeurs
responsables du maintien de l'ordre.
Votre neveu a bénéficié
du passage automatique.
C'est un élčve de 3čme,
qui sera bientôt au lycée.
Excusez-moi, mais Mme Johnson
est lŕ pour Qadriyyah.
Excusez-moi un instant.
- Bill, c'est une connerie.
- Je lui ai dit.
Si ça s'apprend,
sur qui tu crois que ça va retomber ?
Il me reste que deux ans ŕ faire
pour avoir la retraite complčte.
Je désapprouve ce choix aussi,
mais c'est sa décision.
Pas la tienne, pas la mienne.
C'est lui qui va ŕ la mairie
pour se faire botter le cul
tous les jours.
Je me fous de ce que tu racontes.
Si tu cherches la merde,
tu peux pas te plaindre
quand tu la trouves.
Elle lui prenait la tęte depuis le début
avec le miroir et tout.
J'aurais pas hésité.
M. Pryzbylewski,
voici Sherrod.
Il est tout ŕ vous.
Assieds-toi, Sherrod.
Écoutez
J'aimerais...
Tout le monde ?
Je voudrais dire...
Silence !
Nous savons tous qu'une chose...
affreuse s'est déroulée ici vendredi.
Je sais que vous essayez
de vous remettre de...
J'ai pas une balafre
sur la gueule, moi.
J'aimerais parler...
- C'est vrai que vous ętes policier ?
- Quoi ?
Mme Carmandy du secrétariat a dit :
"M. Prezbo, c'est un policier".
- Quoi, vous ętes flic ?
- Vous avez déjŕ flingué quelqu'un ?
Je pense qu'on...
Il a jamais flingué personne.
Regarde-le.
Vous avez déjŕ serré
Ashanti Graham ?
Parfois,
quand une chose grave arrive...
- C'est ton pčre ?
- Non, mon frčre.
Alors vous avez tiré sur quelqu'un ?
- C'est quoi, votre arme ?
- Vous ętes aux stups ?
J'étais policier, avant.
Maintenant, je suis enseignant.
Ętre policier n'est pas seulement
porter une arme.
C'est aussi servir la communauté.
La communauté ? Ça fait un bail
qu'on vous voit plus dans la mienne,
sauf pour cogner sur les gens.
M. P, on vous a déjŕ tiré dessus ?
Je veux dire, genre, bang.
Namond, ça suffit.
Lčve-toi.
Retournez ŕ vos sičges.
Merci, trčs amusant.
Retournez ŕ vos sičges.
Asseyez-vous, asseyez-vous.
Kwaneese, assieds-toi.
Asseyez-vous, tout de suite.
Vous avez déjŕ descendu quelqu'un...
On vous a déjŕ filmé ?
M. P, Ashanti Graham.
Vous avez dű le connaître.
C'était un dur, un vrai.
Il travaille du dimanche au jeudi,
de 7h00 ŕ 17h00.
C'est pas un deuxičme boulot.
Non, c'est pas un flic.
Il est ŕ plein temps sur ce taf pourri.
Qu'est-ce qu'il a fait déjŕ ?
Il a mal parlé.
On va sur Hilltop ?
Ouais, on doit faire ça aussi.
Ŕ plus.
L'heure de vérité, fiston.
Alors, tu la joues comment ?
J'ai dit au petit Kevin lŕ-bas
de vous coller deux balles
dans la tęte chacun.
Mais on dirait qu'il s'est barré.
T'es un marrant.
Ouais, je vais prendre votre matos.
Il est oů, le gars... Michael ?
C'est pas un régulier.
Il travaillait juste pour une dette.
- Pourquoi tu demandes ?
- Laisse tomber les "pourquoi".
"Pourquoi" ne fait plus partie
de ton vocabulaire.
60/40 sur ce truc.
Tu merdes pas avec l'argent de Marlo.
Randy Wagstaff.
Tu n'es pas en sixičme, n'est-ce pas ?
Salut, Mlle Reese.
Si tu étais en sixičme,
toi et le reste des écervelés
seriez toujours
dans mon cours d'anglais.
Ce qui nous ramčnerait
deux ans en arričre.
Ce qui voudrait dire que le temps
s'est arręté dans cette école.
Et ça, ce serait une catastrophe.
Je me suis juste trompé
de chemise aujourd'hui.
Puisque ce n'est pas ton déjeuner,
oů est ton laissez-passer ?
C'était pas plus simple
d'en faire un au crayon de couleur ?
Viens.
Deacon dit que vous ętes
quelqu'un de bien.
Je me débrouille bien
avec une serpilličre.
- Une serpilličre ? Plutôt un aspirateur.
- Quoi ?
J'ai besoin de quelques gars
comme vous ŕ chaque rentrée.
Vous allez dans la rue,
vous trouvez ces gamins
et les ramenez ici.
Un correspondant absentéisme.
L'académie n'a plus
de correspondants absentéisme
depuis 20 ans.
Oů vous croyez-vous,
dans le comté de Montgomery ?
Non, je garde des lignes budgétaires
libres pour ça tous les ans.
Ces gamins ? Vous les ramenez,
vous les rayez de la liste.
Chaque gamin, une fois et c'est fini.
Au mois d'octobre,
vous reprenez la liste.
Je vous engage si vous ętes preneur.
12 $ de l'heure.
Excusez-moi. Assis.
Pourquoi as-tu quitté ta classe ?
J'avais faim.
J'arrivais pas ŕ me concentrer.
Tu avais peut-ętre une autre raison
d'errer dans les couloirs.
Tagger les murs, peut-ętre ?
Vous savez bien que non.
Je sais rien du tout.
Je sais que c'est la deuxičme semaine
et j'ai déjŕ des murs couverts de tags.
Ça te plaît de passer devant ça ?
- Je sais pas.
- Peut-ętre
parce que c'est toi qui fais les graffitis.
- C'est pas moi.
- Alors c'est qui ?
Mlle Thompson ?
Avez-vous le numéro de la mčre
adoptive de Randy Wagstaff ?
- Bien sűr.
- Pour quoi faire ?
Parce que tu sčches les cours.
Tu erres dans les couloirs,
ou pire encore.
Elle a le droit de savoir.
C'est son numéro au travail ?
Attendez.
La nouvelle, Greggs.
Monsieur, avec tout le respect...
Norris est surchargé.
Greggs prend l'affaire Braddock.
Il est pas surchargé.
Si, il l'est. Il a plein d'enquętes,
c'est clair ? Écoutez-moi bien.
Burrell veut que cette affaire
végčte jusqu'aux votes.
Et Rawls ?
Putain, qui sait ce qu'il veut ?
Il dit jamais rien.
Il se rend bien compte
que c'est n'importe quoi.
J'ai bien compris ?
On retire un vétéran d'une affaire en cours
pour la donner ŕ une débutante
pour empęcher tout progrčs
sur l'enquęte ?
Greggs prend l'affaire Braddock.
- Un programme pilote ?
- Pour une de nos écoles.
- Avec une donation de 200 000 $.
- Un don.
- Je suis lŕ pour aider, Mme Conway.
- Aider en quoi ?
Vous dites que vous ciblez
les délinquants violents récidivistes.
Suggérez-vous
que le systčme a perdu
le contrôle de l'école ?
Ce n'est pas ce qu'on dit.
Le systčme est bien.
Le systčme est parfait.
Il ne s'agit pas du systčme.
Nous voulons juste
accéder aux enfants ŕ problčmes
qui ne feront bientôt plus partie
du systčme scolaire.
Restez discrets.
Je ne veux offenser personne.
Il y a une élection bientôt et
nous ne voulons pas mettre nos écoles
- au cśur de ce foutoir.
- Non, en effet.
DÉCONNEXION.
Dans une voiture de patrouille
comme une bleusaille.
Je suis assez fier de te connaître,
- officier McNulty.
- Seulement assez ?
Tu pourrais faire des choses
plus intéressantes.
- Comme quoi ?
- Je te l'avais dit, Lester.
La pomme est pourrie.
On m'a dit qu'ils avaient
coulé ton écoute.
Ils nous ont envoyé
un nouveau lieutenant.
- Marimow du contrôle des taxes.
- Le "tueur d'unité".
Lester et Kima se sont
déjŕ recasés ŕ la Criminelle.
Et Sydnor va se barrer
ŕ la premičre ouverture.
- Alors, l'unité Anti-Crime est morte ?
- Ouais, Lester l'a tuée pour de bon.
J'ai suivi l'argent.
Les gars comme toi
n'apprennent jamais.
- Les gars comme moi ?
- Ouais, 13 ans...
Quatre mois.
Vous avez appelé du renfort ?
Nous avons un mandat d'arręt
pour meurtre
sur un dénommé Curtis Anderson,
alias Lex.
En fuite depuis des semaines,
donc j'espčre pas le trouver
chez sa mčre, mais on sait jamais.
- Quelle adresse ?
- 643 Harlem.
On se fait la porte d'entrée
comme au bon vieux temps, Jim ?
Je prends la porte de derričre.
Derričre ?
Merde, petit,
la pomme est vraiment pourrie.
Tu sais ce qu'on dit sur le gars
qui veut passer par-derričre ?
Il invite.
La taverne B&O.
Ce soir ŕ 21h00, fiston.
Je me tire aprčs un verre.
Si tu me crois pas,
demande ŕ Bunk.
C'est vrai.
R.A.S. dans la chambre.
Le sous-sol aussi.
R.A.S.
R.A.S.
21h00 ce soir, McNulty.
La taverne B&O.
Il est pas lŕ. Je vous l'avais dit.
Il va revenir ŕ la maison ?
Madame, votre fils
est-il encore en vie ?
Parce que s'il ne l'est plus,
on peut tout arręter maintenant.
Autrement, nous avons un témoin
et un mandat pour meurtre.
Ce mandat dit que
nous pouvons passer votre porte
autant de fois que nécessaire.
Je sais pas oů est mon fils.
C'est comme tes oiseaux.
Ils s'en vont,
pour faire un tour en ville,
ils sont libres de le faire.
Mais le soir, ils rentrent ici,
boivent, sont nourris.
Ils savent que t'as un endroit pour eux
qui sera toujours lŕ.
Pas de surprises.
Au bout du compte,
les hommes aiment pas les surprises.
Les oiseaux non plus.
C'est comme ce que je t'offre.
Tu deviens membre du regroupement
et tu auras plus jamais peur
des surprises.
Tu fais comme avant,
mais en plus, t'es sűr que le produit
sera toujours lŕ, et de qualité.
Si un tes gars a un problčme,
il a un avocat et une caution
avant męme de descendre du fourgon.
Je sais engager les avocats.
C'est pas seulement les avocats.
C'est aussi les relations
qui te permettent d'ętre au courant
avant męme l'arrivée des merdes.
Je dois donner quoi
en échange de ce produit ?
Ta main-d'śuvre.
Si t'es avec nous,
on chassera ces gars de New York
de Baltimore est.
Depuis quand
c'est mon problčme ?
Le principe du regroupement,
c'est qu'on se sert les coudes.
On partage les infos
et personne nous cherche.
Personne me cherche.
Ça veut pas dire
que dans un futur...
Personne me cherche.
Les couleurs de l'Afrique.
Subtil.
Tony Gray est crédité de 24%
ŕ l'heure actuelle.
Il vous faut renouveler vos couleurs
et votre message, Clarence.
Vous devez rassembler la base.
Vous voulez que je me mette
ŕ porter un boubou ?
Le genre de merde ŕ la Marion Barry ?
Voilŕ ce que j'aimerais :
75 de plus en liquide
dans la cagnotte.
75 ?
Organisons une autre partie.
C'est une perte de temps,
et le temps est ce qui importe le plus
en ce moment.
Ils vont vous cracher dessus
et soutenir Royce.
Ils ont attendu aussi longtemps
par respect pour Tony Gray.
Ils l'ont donné ŕ Royce
depuis des mois.
Ce n'est pas la question.
Si tu y vas en intrus,
ça ne fera que les énerver.
Vraiment ?
Ou je les énerverai encore plus
en feignant de ne pas les voir,
de ne pas avoir besoin d'eux.
J'ai fait du porte ŕ porte
dans tous les quartiers
pour dire que
je suis pręt ŕ ętre maire.
Pas juste ma base, tout le reste aussi.
Pourquoi je n'irais pas les voir, eux ?
Il a raison.
Ils soutiennent Royce, trčs bien.
Que pourraient-ils faire d'autre ?
Mais que diront-ils
au pupitre le dimanche
précédant les primaires ?
On a toujours une carte ŕ jouer.
Si je fais ça bien,
ils le respecteront.
Dans le cas contraire,
au pire, ils verront
un pauvre blanc
les suppliant ŕ genoux.
C'est toujours un bon moment
pour les gens.
Concernant ma présence
aux conseils municipaux,
ceux qui connaissent le travail
savent bien
qu'ętre conseiller, c'est bien plus
qu'assister aux réunions.
Oui, Charles.
Ils vont mettre un centre
spécialisé au bout de ma rue.
- Pour tous les drogués.
- Je ne le permettrai pas.
Oů vivez-vous, monsieur ?
800 North Carrollton.
Je vais mettre mon nez lŕ-dedans.
Y a-t-il des questions
pour les autres candidats ?
Quelqu'un avec un sujet, un souci ?
J'aimerais revenir
sur l'affaire de monsieur,
concernant
le centre de désintoxication.
Je partage votre inquiétude,
mais il est vrai que la ville compte
des milliers de drogués en cure
et ces centres et abris doivent
bien exister quelque part.
Alors pourquoi pas
dans les quartiers blancs ?
Puis-je voir ça ?
Ce tract pour Royce.
C'est tout ŕ fait juste.
Mais il s'agit d'individus...
de nos frčres et sśurs,
de nos enfants, nos amis.
Ils essayent de changer
et c'est ŕ nous de nous occuper d'eux.
C'est bon de rater une donne, non ?
Ŕ quoi ça sert ?
Au final, on devra cracher au bassinet.
En effet.
Dire qu'il a les couilles
d'organiser
deux parties dans le męme mois.
Franchement...
Il se prépare sa cagnotte.
Il pourra arroser du monde
pour les élections.
Carcetti le rattrape.
Ce sont les fonds de campagne.
Peut-ętre aura-t-on une campagne,
cette fois ?
Ça me dérangerait pas,
s'il n'était pas aussi odieux.
Il avait deux paires
contre le brelan de neuf de Roger.
J'ai passé la main avec une couleur.
Un full. Quatre mains avant.
C'est immoral, voilŕ tout.
Alors, messieurs, le jeu ?
Ça ne tient qu'ŕ Clarence.
"Texas hold 'em".
Je commence ŕ comprendre
l'engouement pour ce jeu.
Pas de limite.
Sympa.
Je commençais ŕ penser
que tu avais perdu la main.
Le salon de cette femme
est un vrai sanctuaire,
digne d'Elvis et Tupac réunis.
Son fils est encore plus mort qu'eux.
Elle a trop peur de le dire.
Ces trucs n'étaient pas lŕ
ŕ ma premičre visite.
Je l'aurais vu.
Tu es un sacré inspecteur, dis donc.
Regarde, elle a une copine.
Trop jeune pour toi, mon gars.
Jeune ?
Toutes jeunes, William.
Et minces aussi. Et nous, non.
Ni plus jeunes ni plus minces.
Oů est Jimmy ?
C'est la nature des choses.
L'âge,
le poids, c'est la nature.
- Pitoyable.
- Impitoyable.
La nature s'en fout.
C'est la nature.
Mon gars Marlo,
je pensais que ça venait de lui.
Quoi donc ?
- Ce gars est un jeune lion.
- "Allô, M. Lyon est lŕ ?"
Et le lion se doit de tuer.
"Une sonde ŕ méthane pour M. Lyon".
Dans ce cas, oů sont mes corps ?
De mon côté,
j'ai eu aucun corps en six mois.
Et de ton côté,
tu cherches un suspect,
apparemment mort.
Probablement parce qu'il a descendu
un gars de Marlo.
Encore une fois, s'il est mort,
oů est son corps ?
Que fait une fille dans un pieu
aprčs l'amour ?
Elle gęne.
Jimmy me l'a apprise.
Oů met-il les corps, Bunk ?
Dans les égouts ?
Aux pompes funčbres, peut-ętre ?
Ils enseignent ce latin de mon cul
dans les écoles catholiques.
L'affaire Eddy Crane ?
Ils l'avaient mis dans un bain d'acide
prčs de Curtis Bay.
Elles viennent vers nous.
Mais pour un gars de l'ouest
comme Marlo Stanfield,
ce serait plutôt dans
des lieux de décharge habituels.
- Salut, beauté.
- Pas vrai ?
- Salut, toi.
- Pas vrai ?
Quoi ?
Je voudrais juste qu'on me gęne.
Pourquoi t'es toujours assis lŕ ?
On dirait la putain de famille
du Cosby Show.
Tiens, les voilŕ.
Il va encore ŕ l'école.
Pour oublier le bordel
de chez eux, tous les jours.
Si tu briefes bien ce gars,
il aura son coin, sans souci.
Ouais, on verra.
T'as pris une cuite ?
T'as vraiment une sale gueule.
Tu sais ce qu'il te faut
sur le lieu d'un crime ?
- Des gants en caoutchouc.
- Un regard doux.
C'est censé me bouleverser ?
En gardant le regard doux,
tu peux tout voir.
Avec un regard dur,
tu regardes l'arbre
et tu ne vois pas la foręt.
Un truc zen.
Les yeux doux, petit scarabée.
La lividité nous donne
l'heure de décčs ŕ 7h48.
- Plus ou moins.
- C'est noté.
Tu devras faire des analyses.
- Tu crois ?
- Ça peut pas nuire.
Maladies aussi ?
Projections de sang ?
Absolument.
T'as pas vu mes cotons-tiges ?
T'en fais pas. J'ai les miens ici.
C'est cool.
Tu veux jeter un śil ?
Il mord pas.
N'oublie pas le marquage.
Je suis un bleu ?
Il a quelque chose dans la main.
Donne-lui une pince.
"M. Patate m'a tué".
C'est tapé ŕ la machine ?
Ça passerait mieux devant la cour.
Le numéro de téléphone
est dans l'autre main.
Un accord standard
de confidentialité.
Et celui-ci ?
Ça nous assure
au cas oů vous ou un
de vos collčgues serait blessé.
- Qui veut apprendre aujourd'hui ?
- En route.
- Je monte ŕ l'avant ?
- Tu montes ŕ l'arričre. On y va.
- Allez.
- T'en fais pas.
- On l'aura plus tard.
- Ce gosse est si excité
d'aller ŕ l'école qu'il veut qu'on fasse
la course avec lui.
On pense quoi de nous ?
Dans la salle des profs ?
Ils disent que vous ętes
le sparadrap de cette année.
Vous le sentez comme ça ?
J'espérais un peu plus que ça.
L'attelle de l'année ?
Bonjour, Mme Sampson.
C'est un flic.
L'académie a l'air favorable.
Et j'ai l'impression
qu'on pourrait nous donner
un peu de liberté, ŕ défaut de soutien.
- Vous croyez ?
- Vous semblez en douter.
Vous pouvez deviner les jours
sur leurs visages.
Le meilleur jour est le mercredi.
C'est le plus long qu'ils ont
loin de chez eux,
des rues.
Vous les voyez sourire.
Le lundi, ils sont en colčre.
Le mardi, ils sont pris
entre le lundi et le mercredi,
ça peut ętre l'un ou l'autre.
Le jeudi...
ils sentent que le week-end arrive.
Le vendredi,
c'est de nouveau mauvais.
C'est lŕ que je vous laisse.
Votre classe.
Maîtrise du langage, hein ?
Bref, vous devriez voir ça
quand je n'y suis pas.
Ils se conduisent autrement
quand je suis lŕ.
J'en doute pas.
Ŕ votre avis, ŕ quoi sert ce 20 ?
Ce n'est pas le nombre de jours
de votre suspension.
Ce n'est pas le nombre
d'années de prison
si vous ne vous reprenez pas.
C'est 50% au-dessous de la moyenne.
C'est męme 30%
sous la note éliminatoire.
En fait, ce nombre
représente l'intéręt
que vous portez ŕ votre propre avenir.
La question suivante vaut deux points.
Qui peut me dire pourquoi
Clarence Mitchell Jr.
était important
pour les droits civiques ?
Le sourire de Shalanta me fait dire
qu'elle va faire gagner les bleus.
Tu as vu celui-lŕ, lŕ-bas ?
Qui est DeShawn Price ?
Jamais entendu parler.
C'est quoi, ton nom ?
Herbert Brown.
C'est la camionnette de ramassage ?
Te voilŕ, mon gars. Allez.
Vous voyez ? Howard Brown.
C'est mon frčre. Il est sur
McHenry Street si vous le voulez.
J'étais ŕ l'école vendredi,
donc je suis tranquille
jusqu'en octobre.
- Attends un peu, mon gars.
- Non, il a raison.
L'école paie une certaine
somme d'argent
pour chaque gosse qui vient
une journée en septembre
- et une journée en octobre.
- Une journée ?
Aprčs ça, ils ne perdent pas
l'argent du gouvernement.
Donc, on en a fini.
L'éducation, c'est important.
J'essaie juste de t'expliquer, frérot.
Lequel d'entre vous n'a pas
fait sa journée de septembre ?
Allez-y maintenant,
on vous emmerdera plus aprčs.
Quoi de neuf, Butch ?
On commence par quoi ?
C'est toi qui as arrangé cette réunion.
Commençons par le respect
de mon temps. Venons-en au fait.
Tout d'abord, j'ai entendu dire
que tu pensais
que j'étais peut-ętre impliqué
avec feu M. Bell,
dans son plan contre toi
et frčre Mouzone.
J'ai rien ŕ voir lŕ-dedans.
Stringer est venu
pour organiser des pourparlers.
Il m'a utilisé comme tout le monde,
je devais le dire.
Voilŕ, c'est dit.
Passons ŕ la suite.
Un homme d'affaires comme moi
évite la rancune
d'un homme comme toi.
- Ça m'empęche de dormir.
- J'en suis certain.
Pour faire amende honorable,
j'ai une proposition.
Je connais une table de poker
dans le quartier ouest.
Grosses mises,
grosses sommes en liquide.
Des valises de fric.
Tu essayes de me piéger, Joe ?
Tu me crois stupide ?
J'essaye de faire les choses
comme il faut avec toi.
On parle de combien ?
S'il n'y a pas plusieurs centaines
de milliers de dollars,
je veux bien ętre aveugle.
Sérieux, Joe.
Je le redis,
tu me prends pour
quelqu'un de stupide ?
- C'est quoi, l'embrouille ?
- Pas d'embrouille.
- Ta part ?
- Le quart du butin.
J'y vais et si ça tourne mal,
je reviendrai te voir, Joe.
Oů ils sont passés ?
Lequel d'entre vous
est le sergent Hauk ?
Et vous devez ętre Dozerman.
Bienvenue ŕ l'Anti-Crime.
Je suis le lieutenant Marimow.
Je vois que vous avez été
promu sergent
aprčs avoir été chauffeur du maire
pendant moins de trois mois.
Vous devez ętre un sacré chauffeur.
Y'a quelqu'un ici ?
Greggs, Freamon ?
Sydnor et Massey.
Dans les rues,
en train de faire des arrestations.
C'est ce que l'on fait ici, maintenant.
On va dans les rues,
on arręte et on s'en va.
Vous pouvez faire ça, sergent ?
Ŕ la maničre du district ouest.
Merci de me recevoir.
Vous avez déjŕ vu
le maire Royce et M. Gray,
et je vous remercie
de m'accueillir dans ce processus.
Je ne m'attends pas ŕ sortir d'ici
avec l'appui de l'assemblée
interconfessionnelle des cultes.
Vraiment pas.
Mais la vérité est que
je pense pouvoir ętre un meilleur maire
pour Baltimore que l'actuel.
J'ai voté pour Clarence Royce
il y a huit ans.
J'ai voté pour lui quatre ans aprčs.
Je sentais une promesse en lui.
Désormais, je suis déçu.
Déçu et en colčre,
par le crime, le gâchis,
et les dégâts infligés
ŕ tant de quartiers.
Dans mon district,
mais aussi dans le quartier ouest.
Pimlico, Cherry Hill,
Edmondson Village.
Oů que j'aille,
les gens veulent les męmes choses.
Ils ont besoin des męmes choses.
Mais ils ne les reçoivent pas.
Je vais changer ça.
Je ne vous demanderai pas votre vote.
Je ne le mérite peut-ętre pas encore.
Mais quand je serai maire,
ma porte vous sera ouverte,
qui que vous souteniez.
Souvenez-vous
que je suis venu ici
pour vous dire tout ça.
Monsieur.
Merci d'ętre venu.
J'aurai besoin d'un avis de recherche
sur un dénommé Patate.
"Rappelez M. Douceur
immédiatement" ?
Laissez-moi deviner...
Le comité gay et lesbien.
Elle prend le coup, les gars.
Vous voulez quoi ?
Une autre sonde ŕ méthane ?
Ou une autre connerie des "Experts"
qui n'existe pas ?
Tu es l'enquętrice principale
sur l'affaire Braddock.
Le témoin abattu.
Norris revient dans la file.
Quoi ?
T'as droit ŕ ton premier meurtre.
Mes compliments.
Arręte.
Ouais, fais ça ŕ la balance.
Qui fait la balance ?
Je sais pas,
mais il y a une balance.
Rashid a été suspendu pour avoir
tagué des murs. Vous saviez pas ?
Il a pu se faire choper
avec une bombe de peinture.
Non, Mme Donnelly est venue
le chercher dans la classe.
Ŕ plus tard.
Tu passeras au gymnase ?
- Ça marche.
- Peace.
Je te le redirai pas.
Passe-moi la télécommande.
Vous avez appris
quelque chose aujourd'hui ?
Vous avez appris
quelque chose aujourd'hui ?
Vous avez appris quoi ?
Je t'ai dit de me donner
la télécommande.
Donne-la.
Tu aimes les maths, non ?
Commence par ça.
J'aime bien les maths.
Et t'es doué pour ça.
J'ai déjŕ vu ce truc cinq fois.
Ça ira ?
Trčs bien.
En ce qui concerne la fille...
Elle a eu plus
de 200 points de suture.
Elle aura de la rééducation
et peut-ętre d'autres opérations.
Les muscles de son visage
ne bougent plus correctement.
Comment la classe réagit ?
Comme si ça n'avait pas eu lieu.
Ils sont encore sous le coup.
On ne dirait pas, mais c'est le cas.
Et Laetitia, que va-t-il lui arriver ?
Rien qu'elle n'ait déjŕ vu.
Elle ira en maison de correction,
ce qui est ŕ peine pire que l'orphelinat.
Elle était en orphelinat ?
Elle a grandi dans le systčme.
En colčre du lundi au vendredi.
L'année derničre,
elle a été suspendue deux fois,
puis expulsée.
Chiquan n'est pas positive,
si ça peut vous rassurer.
Excusez-moi ?
Elle n'a pas le VIH,
au cas oů vous vous inquiéteriez.
Marcus, tu fais quoi, lŕ ?
T'essaies de te faire allonger ?
Baisse la tęte, petit.
Ta gauche !
Soulčve-moi ta gauche.
Soulčve-moi ce poing !
Ce garçon n'écoute personne ?
Bon. Stop.
Pas mal.
Pas mal, Justin.
Marcus, tu dois
te concentrer et réfléchir.
Compris ?
J'ai des billets
pour les combats de ce soir.
Ŕ l'armurerie de Pikesville.
Je voulais emmener Justin et Spider,
mais Spider est pas lŕ.
Marcus, tu dois t'occuper
de ta mčre, non ?
Donc, Michael...
Tu veux venir voir les combats ?
- T'y vas ?
- Ouais, j'y vais.
D'accord.
Enlčve-moi ce casque.
C'est quoi, ça ?
Un souvenir.
Quoi ?
Le problčme avec cette façon de faire,
les faire disparaître et tout,
c'est que personne ne sait.
Je me souviens
quand j'étais gamin...
Sur une carte du monde,
le terrain de jeu au coin
de Baker et Moreland
aurait été le centre du monde.
Quand j'ai grandi,
le terrain a pas arręté de grandir.
Au-delŕ du quartier.
Tout change, tu sais ?
Une minute, tu veux seulement entendre
le camion du marchand de glaces.
La minute suivante,
la voix des rabatteurs
est la seule chose que tu entends.
C'est quoi ?
Un livre que j'utilise avec ça.
Donc tu lis dans le petit
et tu réponds dans le grand ?
C'est pas difficile.
Je vois ça.
Je vois ça.
Tu vois comment il tient sa garde ?
Regarde ses pieds.
Regarde leurs pieds.
Ses pieds bougent tout le temps.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
Regarde comme il reste prčs.
Ça rend l'autre impuissant.
Ce type est une armoire.
C'est de la discipline.
Tu prends soin de ton corps
et ton corps prend soin de toi.
Sa meuf doit ętre bonne.
Ouais, je crois aussi.
Couleur ŕ la reine.
Full.
Tout le monde,
mettez tous vos mains en évidence.
Vos mains.
Et toi, mon grand, arręte-toi.
Je sais pas jouer,
mais ce carré de cinq
doit battre un full.
Le banquier, envoie la thune.
Si tu veux garder la tęte
sur les épaules, bouge-toi.
C'est mon argent.
L'argent n'a pas de propriétaire,
juste des gens qui le dépensent.
Autre chose.
J'aime bien cette bague.
Je suis pas le genre ŕ me répéter.
On se reverra.
C'est comme ça
que tu joues, gringalet ?
Parce que je sais trouver tes gars
beaucoup plus facilement que l'inverse.
Profites-en bien.
Sans problčme.
Tu vois ce que je disais, Justin ?
C'est pas du chiqué.
Si tu continues ŕ t'entraîner,
tu peux y arriver.
Le dernier combat était le meilleur.
Le Portoricain avait une jolie gauche.
Oui, bien pęchue.
C'est lŕ. Juste lŕ, ŕ droite.
Trčs bien.
Je vous vois demain, entraîneur.
Tu habites sur...
Qu'est-ce que tu fiches ?
Je te ramčne chez toi.
Michael, allez, viens. Sérieux<i>..</i>
Non, c'est bon.
Je me débrouillerai.
Pour buter un enculé,
tu lui mets un flingue sur la tête,
tu dis "pan" et il y passe.
- Mais si c'est Chris qui le fait...
- Ça marche pas, Nay.
- Je sais que t'inventes.
- Je te le jure. Lex est pas mort.
Je l'ai vu ramper
dans une allée près du terrain.
Tout le monde sait que Lex est mort.
Non, y'a mort, et mort spécial.
Chris se sert de grigris.
Non, mec.
C'est des zombies.
Pourquoi des maisons vides ?
Il a besoin de temps pour les changer.
Si tu me crois pas, tu verras.
Ils déconnent, Michael, non ?
J'en sais rien
pour ces trucs vaudou,
mais Chris fait un truc...
Il fait rentrer un mec là-dedans,
qui sait qu'il va se faire buter.
Chris, il est différent. Ça se voit
à ces fringues de péquenaud
qu'il porte.
9 mm ?
Non, trop de bruit.
Sûrement un calibre 40.
C'est du sérieux.
Tu dis que Lex est un zombie ?
Pookie, Byron, tous ces mecs.
- Et Chris ?
- Chris... le maître des zombies.
Je savais que ça s'envolerait pas.
C'est ce qu'on a essayé de te dire.
Chris a le pouvoir.
Il leur dit de venir et ils viennent.
Comme le diable avec les damnés.
Tu crois que Chris leur fait faire quoi ?
C'est sûrement des espions.
Ça expliquerait comment
Marlo en sait autant.
Ouais, c'est ça. Comme dans ce film,
"Le Tueur de zombies",
où ils sortaient la nuit,
pour chasser.
- Pour chasser ?
- Ouais. Ils...
Dans ce film, ils enlevaient les gens
et leur volaient leur chaleur.
SUR ÉCOUTE
"Si t'es des nôtres, t'es des nôtres".
St. Jude,
patron des causes perdues.
Dis-moi que tu ne t'es pas agenouillé
pour murmurer chaque nuit
dans sa sainte oreille
avant de fermer tes mirettes.
Je sais que tu l'as fait, Tommy,
pour avoir une telle veine.
Stan, tu es sûr de ça ?
Sur la vie de ma mère.
Ils ont foutu un nouveau.
Une gonzesse en plus,
comme inspecteur en charge.
En enlevant au passage
un bon élément.
Tommy, n'oublie pas,
tout ce que tu voudras.
C'est un sacré numéro.
Valchek ?
Je suis obligé de faire avec.
Pour un siège de conseiller,
il faut sympathiser avec
le commandant, grec ou polonais,
qu'ils ont parachuté.
- Pas un Italien ?
- On n'est plus assez là-bas.
- Tu penses qu'il a raison ?
- Que Royce a trafiqué l'affaire ?
Impossible que le maire le sache.
Tu as raison. Ça sent
le Ervin Burrell à des kilomètres.
On s'en tape que le maire le sache.
Si c'est vrai,
on sort le truc et on frappe
un grand coup.
- J'informe la presse ?
- C'est imparable.
Ils ont saboté une enquête criminelle.
À jeter de l'huile sur le feu,
on pourrait se brûler aussi.
On le refile à Tony Gray.
On reste en retrait,
hors de la ligne de mire de Royce,
et en bonus,
on booste la campagne de Gray
qui prend des voix
de l'électorat du maire.
Je suis un putain de génie du mal,
quand je suis lancé.
Au final,
on a 13 mandats et six lieux.
Et vu mes effectifs...
C'est pas un problème.
Vous aurez un sergent, une escouade
d'intervention et une de réserve.
- Une unité complète si vous voulez.
- Très bien.
Vous gaspillez une écoute
pour de petites arrestations.
Si on fait ça bien,
on pourrait attraper Marlo
ou un de ses lieutenants,
à ces endroits,
- avec de la came.
- Marlo Stanfield...
Dans une pièce, avec de la came ?
J'ai enfoncé des portes et surpris
de plus gros bonnets que lui.
Je vous avertis, lieutenant,
je refuse de plaider sur une écoute
pour de petits larcins.
À vous de voir.
Non, c'est faux.
À demain, commandant.
Des cadavres flottants.
T'en as eu d'autres ?
- Pas plus que d'habitude.
- Et ceux en décomposition ?
Tu as quoi ?
- Deux ou trois non identifiés.
- Trouvés à Baltimore ?
Non, deux de Prince George,
- un de Dorchester.
- Non, il irait pas si loin.
Si je comprends bien,
vous cherchez des cadavres,
pas un en particulier,
à part ce gamin que vous avez
déjà mis sur le téléscripteur.
C'est ça.
Vous n'avez pas assez de boulot ?
Si vous faites bien votre travail
et vos devoirs,
vous gagnerez des autocollants.
Vous changez ça tous les jours.
Vous nous embrouillez, M. P.
Un bon comportement en cours,
ça fera un autre autocollant.
À la fin de la semaine, les quatre élèves
avec le plus d'autocollants
gagnent un prix et sont qualifiés
pour le grand tirage à la fin du mois.
Si vous faites pas votre boulot,
si vous vous comportez mal
en classe...
votre nom est inscrit là.
Retenue. Une heure après les cours,
sans exception.
C'est à vous de voir :
des autocollants pour des prix
ou rester avec moi après les cours.
Pourquoi me foutre en retenue ?
Tu as interrompu le cours, Namond.
Quand vous êtes arrivé ici,
vous nous traitiez bien et tout,
et là, vous me punissez avant même
que je connaisse les règles.
C'est pas juste.
Quand tu as raison, Namond,
tu as raison.
M. P., je veux des autocollants.
Zenobia, tu dois faire ton travail.
Je veux bien, mais j'ai pas de crayons.
Je veux pas de putain
de crayon de charité !
J'ai le sentiment
qu'il y a deux types de gamins
dans ce bâtiment :
les gamins des porches
et ceux des rues.
- Pardon ?
- Les gamins des porches.
Ceux qui restent sur leur palier
quand leur parents leur disent.
Les autres vont dans la rue.
Ils peuvent pas rester tranquilles en cours.
Les autres le peuvent et le font.
- Séparons les deux.
- C'est du marquage.
- Pardon ?
- Marquage d'élèves.
C'est une sale expression
utilisée dans l'éducation.
Ça se réfère au regroupement
d'élèves selon ce qu'on attend d'eux.
- Et quel est le problème ?
- Vous réduisez ainsi vos attentes
pour certains élèves, vous attendez
moins d'eux scolairement.
Vous prétendez instruire
tous ces gosses,
mais en vérité,
vous n'en instruisez aucun.
Et si les gamins des porches
étaient dans des classes
sans distractions ?
- Et les gamins des rues ?
- C'est ceux qui vous intéressent ?
C'est pour ça
que vous avez eu la bourse.
Tant qu'on n'entrepose pas
ces enfants,
je suis pour, si ça me permet
de faire mon boulot.
Chaque prof vous dira la même chose.
Mais il vous faut présenter
un programme
qui s'adresse vraiment
aux gamins des rues.
Si on retire des gosses des classes,
ne seront-ils pas stigmatisés ?
Il n'y a pas de stigma à se faire
jeter du cours régulièrement ?
La question est :
comment identifier
les gamins des rues ?
Ce ne sera pas un problème.
Tu comprends l'exercice ?
Allez, c'est facile.
Je sais que tu sais le faire.
Tu ne me donnes pas le choix.
Tu iras en retenue.
Mme D. remue les buissons.
Retournez à vos places.
Putain, elle a trouvé ma lame.
J'ai dit de retourner vous asseoir.
Mme D. qui vole.
Je récupérerai jamais ma lame.
Yo, pourquoi vous me regardez ?
Je fais mon travail.
Je suis pas ton "yo".
Montre-moi ton travail.
Oui, je vois.
Ma main me fait mal à force d'apprendre.
Vous avez de l'aspirine ?
J'ai surtout une retenue pour toi.
Va te faire enculer, Prezbo.
Enculé d'estropié aux grandes dents.
Assez. Tu sors !
Sors !
Sortez votre matraque
et tabassez-moi.
Je sais que vous en crevez d'envie.
Tout le monde retourne à sa place.
Tu regardes quoi, enculé ?
Mlle Sampson, je...
Namond Brice, si tu ne te dirigeais pas
vers le bureau du principal,
- c'est maintenant le cas.
- Ouais, j'étais juste...
Un gosses des rues, hein ?
Ils se montrent
quand on a besoin d'eux.
Tu veux que je te dise
que t'as raison. T'as raison.
J'aurais dû être protégé
à la partie de cartes.
Ce qui est fait est fait.
Faut qu'on décide
ce qu'on va faire pour Omar.
Si tu mets le prix,
quelqu'un va bien repérer
ce trou du cul à l'odeur.
Et là, ce sera à toi de jouer.
Tu crois ?
Je dis pas qu'on peut pas choper Omar.
On peut tous les choper.
Mais une fois
qu'on a passé le message
et qu'il apprend
qu'on a mis sa tête à prix,
il en aura après nous aussi.
Tu dis que je devrais laisser pisser ?
Non, faut le choper
d'une autre manière.
Sans prime,
sans conneries de ce genre.
Barksdale a retourné la ville
en lui courant après.
Ça l'a juste rendu faible.
Je suis pas Barksdale.
C'est facile de parler.
On attend, on trouvera un moyen
de se faire cette tapette.
Mais d'ici là, on dit pas un mot.
Je t'en donne six maintenant
et je te file les quatre plus tard. Allez !
Non, j'ai besoin des 10 maintenant.
- T'es pas à l'école ?
- Demi-journée. Réunion des profs.
Je t'ai dit d'arrêter
les excuses à la con.
- J'étais là le premier.
- Pas besoin de se battre...
T'as 4 $ pour moi ?
Il me manque 4 $.
Qu'est-ce tu me racontes ?
T'as un chariot rempli.
Qu'est-ce que t'as ?
Je sais que tu le planques.
Où c'est ?
Tu m'entends pas ?
Dans ma chaussure.
Il m'en manque plus quatre
maintenant.
Où est la pelle ?
Y'a plus qu'à l'enterrer.
Et voilà, monsieur. Merci.
- Tommy Carcetti, candidat à la mairie.
- Bonne chance, Tommy.
- M. Carcetti, vous avez mon vote.
- Merci.
- Tom Carcetti.
- Merci beaucoup.
Bonne chance, monsieur.
Comment allez-vous ?
Tommy Carcetti.
Monsieur, c'est l'heure
d'aller dans le quartier ouest.
Petit enculé.
Tu me forces à employer
la manière forte.
Je vais prendre 25 cônes
d'encens au chèvrefeuille.
Pour avoir la forme
pour la semaine prochaine.
Les mecs de Tony Gray ont dit
dans 20 minutes chez eux.
Merde, Clarence.
On se croirait en 98
- quand tu as surpris tout le monde.
- Je suis prêt.
Pourquoi nous le donner ?
Pourquoi vous ne le collez pas à Royce ?
Après ce qu'a fait Tommy au débat,
ça semblera être la même chose
si ça vient de lui.
Et si on s'en sert pour prendre
quatre ou cinq points à la base de Royce,
ça l'aidera autant que nous.
Chat échaudé craint l'eau froide.
Je dois toujours avoir un coup d'avance
avec Tommy Carcetti.
Tony, vous ne gagnerez pas.
La seule question est de savoir
si vous voulez perdre avec 24 %
ou 28 %.
Si vous augmentez votre score,
vous serez bon pour la législature.
Peut-être même pour le Congrès.
M. P., je peux y aller ? Ma mère m'a dit
de rentrer directement après l'école.
La mienne, aussi.
Tu aurais dû y penser
avant de renverser de l'encre
sur mon bureau.
C'était pas ma faute.
Mon stylo a explosé.
M. P., s'il vous plaît,
je peux y aller ?
J'ai pas déjeuné,
mon estomac fait des bruits bizarres.
Je manquerai plus jamais
de respect à votre crayon, promis.
Zenobia,
le problème n'était pas le crayon.
S'il vous plaît, M. P.
Très bien.
Cette fois-ci,
je vais faire une exception.
Mais la prochaine fois,
attendez-vous à rester toute l'heure.
- Que veux-tu ?
- Je viens m'excuser.
Je voulais pas vous rentrer
dedans comme ça.
J'apprécie, Namond.
C'est courageux d'admettre
ses erreurs.
Je ne comprends pas, je te vois faire
ton travail chez Mme Sampson.
- Pourquoi tu ne fais pas pareil ici ?
- Je voulais, vraiment.
Des fois, ça me prend et avant même
de m'en rendre compte, je suis parti.
On verra demain
si on peut faire mieux.
Y'a pas de demain.
Mme D. me vire.
Je dois y aller. À plus, M. P.
Tu peux patienter dehors ?
C'est bon. Il peut rester.
M. P., Michael peut pas
rester en colle.
J'ai vu ça.
Maintenant, c'est le double.
- Il a deux jours de suite à faire.
- Il peut vraiment pas.
Il doit aller chercher
son petit frère à l'école.
Il n'a qu'à trouver quelqu'un
pour le faire à sa place.
C'est pas aussi simple.
Michael serait là s'il pouvait,
mais il a personne
pour aller chercher son frère Bug.
Vous savez,
sa mère est une junkie.
On rentre. Tu viens ?
Non. J'attends Alpo.
Madame Sampson l'a collé.
- Tu vas attendre ici jusqu'à 17h00.
- C'est une femme de poigne.
Elle fait pas de cadeau.
- On se voit plus tard.
- À plus.
Tu veux pas jouer dans la NBA ?
Peut-être la NFL, alors?
Je croyais que tous les garçons
de la classe voulaient jouer en pro.
Non, on dit juste ça comme ça.
Et toi alors ?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux faire
quand tu seras grand ?
J'aurai mon magasin.
C'est malin.
Il va falloir que tu sois bon en maths.
Vous les avez laissées à l'intérieur.
Vous inquiétez pas, M. P.
On va vous aider. Donut !
Donut est un dingue de voitures.
Il peut ouvrir n'importe laquelle.
Quoi, mec ?
Il a laissé les clés dedans.
C'est bon.
Je peux appeler un garage.
Pas de problème.
T'avais envie de dealer
dans la rue, hein ?
Je veux comprendre.
T'as pas besoin de faire ça.
Je veux apprendre
des trucs par moi-même.
J'essaie de t'aider, Sherrod,
mais tu m'en empêches.
Je connais pas le gars
qui t'a cogné, Bubs.
Il était à court de fric.
Je te jure, c'était un inconnu.
Quand les merdes commencent,
on peut plus rien faire, hein ?
J'aurais fait quoi
si c'était toi qu'il avait tabassé ?
Rien non plus.
La rue, c'est comme ça.
Ils vont se servir de toi, Sherrod.
Tu peux rester ce soir,
mais si t'es pas à l'école demain,
notre partenariat est terminé.
Ces deux circonscriptions
sont la clé du 5e district.
Si vous pouvez prendre 18%
à Carcetti dans celles-là,
on peut être sûrs qu'il échouera
au niveau de la ville.
On s'est alliés avec qui, là-bas ?
Le N.D.O, j'espère...
...Ces allégations selon lesquelles
des policiers haut placés sont intervenus
pour retirer un policier confirmé
de l'affaire à controverse.
L'affaire Braddock est devenu
un enjeu majeur de la campagne
quand M. Carcetti a prétendu
que cet homme du district ouest
avait été tué
parce qu'il était témoin
dans une affaire.
Ils ont eu peur que la police démontre
leur pire crainte,
que Fredro Braddock a été tué
parce qu'il était témoin
et que la ville n'a pas su le protéger.
C'est sur les trois chaînes.
Le "Sun" et le "Post"
ont appelé pour des réactions.
Mes sources au sein du département
disent que les officiers de base
sont outrés par cette manipulation
politique flagrante.
Monte le son.
Greggs, tu es célèbre.
...remplacer
un policier confirmé et décoré,
avec 15 ans d'expérience
en tant qu'inspecteur...
- Ça doit être moi.
- ... pour mettre un débutant
- dont c'est la première enquête.
- Ça doit être toi.
- Nous devons repenser...
- Qu'est-ce que je lui ai fait ?
Tu vas le faire trop lourd.
Ça marcherait
si on le fait plus grand.
Ça marcherait avec du bois de balsa.
- C'est léger et rigide.
- T'es complètement...
Merde.
Le maître des zombies.
Il faut que tu nous accompagnes.
Non, je suis bien ici.
Barrez-vous, les gamins.
D'accord, Chris, on bouge.
- Snoop, ta sœur est dans ma classe.
- Quoi ? T'es défoncé ou quoi ?
Vous fumez cette merde ?
On m'a dit du bien de toi.
Il paraît que t'es réglo,
tu t'occupes des tiens,
t'es pas un mendiant.
Connard, tu écoutes ce qu'il te dit ?
Il te fait des compliments.
Et t'es là, comme un idiot.
Calme-toi.
Des fois, il s'emballe un peu.
Je dis juste que
ce gars est pas normal !
On est toujours preneurs
d'un bon soldat.
Quand on en voit un qui nous plaît,
on prend la situation en main.
On le met dans le bain, on le forme,
il fait partie de la famille.
Et si t'es des nôtres,
t'es des nôtres,
et on sera toujours derrière toi.
Si t'es intelligent, tu nous rejoins.
J'ai déjà une famille.
Ma mère et mon petit frère.
Ouais. Je sais.
Mais réfléchis-y.
On sera là
quand t'en auras besoin.
Il m'a vu. J'en suis sûr.
Je suis sûr que Chris a interrogé
Michael sur moi.
Je le savais. Je suis mort.
T'es en un seul morceau.
- J'ai cru qu'ils allaient...
- Ouais, je sais.
Il t'a demandé quoi sur moi ?
- Tu lui as dit quoi ?
- Calme-toi.
- C'était pas pour toi.
- Vas-y, mec,
tu dois me le dire.
Qu'est-ce qu'il voulait ?
T'as raison.
Chris en avait après toi.
Il t'en veut pour un truc grave.
Je sais même pas quoi.
Non, je me fous de ta gueule.
Il a même pas prononcé ton nom.
Erv, et puis quoi encore ?
Vos policiers vont tirer sur des touristes ?
Peut être crasher un hélicoptère
sur le port ?
À quoi doit-on s'attendre pour
la dernière semaine de campagne ?
J'ai fait ce que vous demandiez,
ni plus ni moins.
Hamsterdam,
une zone franche de trafic de drogue ?
Il en a pris la responsabilité.
- Des assignations dans toute la ville.
- Ça aussi.
La fuite pour le meurtre du témoin.
C'était lui aussi, non ?
- Bien sûr.
- Et maintenant, ce dernier truc,
changer les enquêteurs de l'affaire.
Ça rime à quoi ?
- Saborder l'enquête ?
- Ouais, en effet.
- C'est horrible.
- M. le maire, vous m'avez demandé
de ralentir l'enquête.
C'est ça, la subtilité, Ervin ?
Vous auriez pu retenir des infos
pendant quelques semaines.
Vous auriez mis un rapport ou deux
dans un tiroir.
Mais retirer quelqu'un de l'enquête ?
Écoutez Vous m'avez dit...
Vous vouliez précisément que je...
Ervin, vous pouvez disposer.
- M. le maire...
- Ce sera tout, M. le préfet.
Non, j'ai deux mots à dire
à votre adjoint, Ervin.
Asseyez-vous.
J'ai essayé de le prévenir.
Il y a eu une fuite à la Criminelle
sur le témoin mort,
pourquoi pas une autre
si nous remplaçons un enquêteur ?
Pourquoi n'êtes-vous pas
venu nous voir avant ?
Je suis un subordonné loyal,
M. le maire.
Ervin est un type bien qui travaille
sous une pression considérable.
C'est une plaie.
Vous ne flanchez pas sous la pression,
M. le sous- préfet ?
Pas le moins du monde.
Faites disparaître tout ça, Bill.
Je ne l'oublierai pas, croyez-moi.
Encore un truc...
Slim Charles est venu me voir.
Il dit que le gros veut discuter.
Non. On a déjà parlé.
Slim dit que le gros savait que
la partie de poker serait braquée.
Vraiment ? Arrange ça.
Pourquoi t'es toujours là ?
C'est calme.
Je vois les choses venir.
Mais t'es dehors dans le froid.
J'aime pas parler à l'intérieur.
T'en as pas pour longtemps.
Tu sais, j'ai quasiment tout.
J'ai juste besoin
de quelques jours de plus.
Garde mon argent pour l'instant.
- J'ai quelque chose à te faire faire.
- Tout ce que tu veux, Marlo.
Omar va revenir dans ton magasin,
te braquer et te dépouiller.
Tu vas appeler la police
et déposer une plainte. Tu me suis ?
Ouais, ça marche,
mais quand il va sortir,
il va s'en prendre à moi.
J'ai pas peur.
- Je dis ça comme ça.
- Il sortira pas.
On sort avec une caution
pour un braquage.
Débrouille-toi pour que
ça soit plus grave.
Si tu as un problème,
si tu ne peux pas rester en colle,
tu dois me le dire.
C'est ta responsabilité.
Les gens ne demandent qu'à t'aider,
mais c'est à toi de demander.
Tu peux retourner à la cafétéria.
Ou rester ici.
Duquan. Tu peux venir ?
Je pense que tu pourras
peut-être m'aider. J'en ai trop pris.
Apporte ça à la cafétéria
et prends-toi quelque chose
à boire au distributeur.
Crystal, tu as une minute ?
Quel est le problème de Duquan ?
Je lui ai donné des habits neufs.
Je m'attendais...
Il a dû les perdre.
Aussi vite ?
C'est pas ça.
Sa famille prend ses affaires
pour les vendre dans la rue.
Tu plaisantes ?
Tout le monde le sait.
Ce qui m'amène à notre proposition.
À chaque gosse son approche.
Dites-nous à qui faire appel
pour avoir le feu vert.
Le "Palais du Puzzle" ?
Si vous voulez encore nous aider,
ça me va.
C'est le seul feu vert
dont vous avez besoin ici.
On vous attend pour régler
le problème de Stricker Street.
Des disputes de quartiers
que les gosses m'amènent ici.
Deux bagarres hier, à cause des mères
qui peuvent pas s'entendre.
Je dois y aller.
Mme Donnelly vous aidera
pour les détails.
Mais, juste pour
que vous l'entendiez, merci.
Ce sera la seule fois où quelqu'un
du système pensera à le dire.
C'est un homme bien.
Vous devez le protéger.
- Le protéger ?
- Il a pris des risques pour vous
et dans ce milieu, ils savent
se servir d'une tronçonneuse.
Si quelqu'un a un problème
avec nous,
ça tombe sur lui.
Alors, vous avez mentionné
les élèves de 3ème ?
Nous avons 256 inscrits.
241 sont habituellement présents.
De ceux-là, 40 seraient
des gosses des rues.
40 ?
C'est faisable.
- Vous suggérez quoi ?
- Commencez avec 10.
Mlle Sampson aura ceux
qu'il vous faut.
- Parmi eux, un certain Namond Brice ?
- La crème des crèmes.
Mais vous devrez attendre.
Il est exclu pendant trois jours.
Quand j'étais élève à l'académie,
j'étais ici à la recherche d'un cadavre.
L'instructeur disait à la radio
que nous cherchions un corps
en particulier.
"Si vous déterrez
tous ceux que vous voyez,
on en aura pour la journée",
disait-il.
Leakin Park,
où tout Baltimore ouest
apporte ses morts.
Plus maintenant,
si on y regarde bien.
Pas au bord de la route,
en tout cas.
S'il les balance ici,
il les balance loin dans les bois.
Allez, viens.
Sur chaque descente,
on cherche de la drogue,
de l'argent ou des armes.
Tous les mandats
concernent
des malfrats de haut rang.
De vieilles adresses liées
à des gamins des rues sans influence.
On cherchera aussi des coins
à drogue dans ces endroits.
Les fourgons attendront
à cet endroit-là.
Heure d'attaque : 15h00.
Nous prenons position 10 minutes
avant l'assaut, ici.
C'est moi qui donne le départ.
Des questions ? Excellent.
On va en salle de pause
jusqu'à l'heure du show.
Les mandats, c'est une chose,
mais balayer les rues des gangs
de Marlo ? Vous êtes sérieux ?
Carv, tu surestimes ces abrutis.
Fais-moi confiance, beau gosse.
Quelles conneries.
Ils te font faire quoi pour ton patron ?
Qui, le lieutenant ?
Non, Royce.
Herc, le maire, c'est ta mine d'or.
S'il fait encore quatre ans,
tu pourras porter des bijoux en or.
Tu devrais pas plutôt te balader
avec un panneau de campagne ?
Et voilà la conclusion de la dernière
croisade de l'unité Anti-Crime.
Avec des larmes.
Lester pleurerait de voir son dispositif
saccagé pour cette merde.
Des descentes pour Marlo Stanfield ?
- Vous préparez quoi d'autre ?
- En affaires de stup ?
La Criminelle a l'accusation
de Burman. Rien à part cela.
Plus ça va, moins les affaires
de drogue font recette.
Si Demper gagne et arrive
à oublier mes violations,
peut-être que j'irai supplier
pour avoir de nouvelles affaires.
Je ne sais pas. J'ai l'impression
que trop c'est trop.
Sergent, vous vouliez me voir ?
Des frites ? Du poulet ?
Assieds-toi.
Norris va reprendre
l'affaire Braddock.
Par ordre du sous-préfet.
D'ailleurs, on va prétendre
qu'il n'a jamais lâché l'affaire,
que lui et toi étiez partenaires,
une équipe de choc,
travaillant ensemble.
Va te faire foutre, gros lard.
Pas très original, mais succinct.
J'aime ton approche.
Vous m'avez déjà humiliée
une fois en me donnant ce truc
et vous allez encore me faire honte
en ramenant Norris.
C'est la Criminelle, Inspecteur.
C'est pas une unité de planqués
où tout le monde se fout
de ce que tu appelles
du travail de police.
Les chefs ?
Ils connaissent nos noms ici.
Je n'ai pas aimé
quand ils sont venus me voir
et m'ont dit de lourder Norris,
mais je l'ai fait.
Et je n'ai pas envie
de faire leur sale boulot
alors qu'ils font comme s'ils
ne m'avaient pas dit de le faire,
mais je ferai le sale boulot.
Et au final,
quand tout le monde dans l'unité
sera noyé sous la merde,
ce lieutenant de police
sera toujours debout.
Donc...
Rends-moi cette histoire crédible.
Norris a toujours été le principal,
et tu l'assistes désormais
sur une enquête
qui progresse
au moment même où nous parlons.
Le colonel est au courant
de tout ça ?
Il est à l'hôpital.
La chimio n'a pas marché.
La conférence de presse est en haut
dans une demi-heure.
- Ne sois pas en retard.
- Une conférence de presse ?
Je voulais pas me moquer de toi.
Je sais que ça paraît dingue,
mais je rigolais pas.
Lex est un zombie, je te jure.
Je le savais avant que
Nay et les autres le disent.
Écoute
Ils m'ont dit d'aller dire à Lex
de venir au terrain de jeu.
Je lui ai dit d'y aller
pour voir une nana.
Il est jamais revenu.
Ils vont me faire quoi
quand ils en auront après moi ?
C'est logique que Chris les amène
dans les maisons vides...
Pour les changer...
et tu sais quoi d'autre.
C'est pas ce qu'il fait.
Chris, les maisons vides...
Les changer ?
Il les change pas, il les tue.
C'est tout. Ils se font tuer.
Comment tu le sais ?
Faut le dire à personne.
Je l'ai vu.
Je les ai vus amener un gars
dans une maison
sur Calhoun.
T'as vu ça ?
C'est faux.
L'inspecteur Norris a travaillé
sans relâche sur cette affaire
et de par son expérience
aux Stupéfiants,
l'inspecteur Greggs fut
assignée pour l'aider
plutôt que le remplacer.
Mais depuis deux jours, des sources
de votre département disaient...
Je suis du département
et je vous dis que ce n'est pas vrai.
On ne mêle pas la politique
à une enquête criminelle.
Comment expliquez-vous
les allégations de M. Gray ?
Vous devriez lui poser la question.
- Police ! Perquisition !
- Prends l'arrière.
- Au sol !
- Police ! Perquisition !
L'escalier.
- Bouge pas !
- La pièce du fond.
Ton cul par terre, j'ai dit.
- À terre !
- À terre !
- C'est bien la bonne adresse ?
- Non, c'est 1200.
On est au bon endroit ?
- C'était une planque ?
- Si on en croit les écoutes.
Depuis combien de temps ?
Ils bougent, vous savez.
- Rien avec les mandats.
- Des arrestations mineures
- sur les coins désignés.
- Ils ont été informés.
- Vous pensez ?
- Avec tous ces endroits vides,
c'est obligé. Cet enculé de Marlo
se croit plus malin que nous ?
Il se trompe.
Sergent, je veux savoir où il zone.
Vous voulez dire lui en personne ?
Il bouge, lieutenant. Il flotte.
Mais je l'ai vu dans
Concrete Park derrière Fulton.
- Dans un parc ?
- S'il fait beau, il s'assoit
sur une chaise longue,
entouré de sa cour.
Il a du monde qui le protège
de toute approche.
Impossible de le surprendre.
À mon avis, il aime parler dehors
pour éviter d'être sur écoute.
Sergent, que peut-on faire avec ça ?
J'admets avoir fait certaines erreurs.
Burrell étant une des plus grosses.
Il a un travail
pendant encore 10 jours.
Après les élections, il part,
croyez-moi.
Et cette dernière boulette...
retirer un inspecteur !
- Vous vous attendiez à quoi ?
- Pas à ça.
Je n'ai rien à voir avec ce foutoir.
C'est un mensonge. J'étais
à cette réunion où vous lui avez dit :
- "Faites traîner l'affaire".
- Je n'ai pas voulu dire...
Personne ne sait plus
ce que vous voulez dire, Clarence.
Regardez ça.
Regardez !
Vous m'aviez donné votre parole.
Votre parole, Clarence.
Vous voilà vous affichant avec
Eunetta dans les meilleurs quartiers
et ensuite vous affichant
avec mon amie Daniels,
là où elle est forte.
Odell, c'est la première
fois que je vois ça.
Allons ! C'est sûrement l'entourage
d'Eunetta qui a fait cette merde.
Avec "Citoyens pour Royce"
écrit en gros ?
Regardez-vous, Clarence.
Vous avez oublié votre programme.
Vous avez oublié votre base.
Vous pensez que vous raser
et quelques affiches de Marcus Garvey
vont vous aider ?
Vous pensez que ça va effacer
toutes vos magouilles
avec tous ces foutus promoteurs ?
Bordel, vous êtes même
dans les combines de Clay Davis.
Ne jouez pas les hommes
de bonne vertu avec moi, Odell.
- Les campagnes coûtent de l'argent.
- L'argent de qui ?
Celui des enfoirés que vous avez
à votre table de jeu tous les mois,
qui vous graissent la patte ?
Je sais ça aussi.
Votre problème...
Allez vous faire foutre. Je refuse
de m'impliquer davantage là-dedans.
- Je vais m'abstenir.
- Faites donc.
- Les primaires ?
- Je m'abstiens.
Vous vous prenez pour qui ?
En novembre, je serai
toujours le roi de la ville.
Odell, si vous me tournez le dos,
je ne l'oublierai pas !
On ne peut pas le perdre. On a besoin
de son organisation pour mardi.
- Allez le chercher !
- Je l'emmerde,
ce monsieur parfait !
Putain !
Délégué Watkins.
Attendez, monsieur.
Je suis sûr qu'on peut s'arranger.
Vous et le maire
n'avez qu'à en discuter.
Le sous-préfet Rawls,
s'il vous plaît.
Ici le lieutenant Hoskins,
de la mairie.
Tu vas te servir du trou
dans le mur ?
Ouais, je vais foutre de la merde
de chien sur le dessus.
Je ne veux pas
que quelqu'un y touche.
C'est bon ?
Lève-la un peu.
C'est bon.
Comme ça, très bien.
- J'ai entendu un truc.
- Des rats.
- Ça va ?
- Faut qu'on y aille.
D'abord,
c'est rien qu'une petite pute.
En plus, c'est un ex-flic.
Tu connais le topo.
Je vais aux toilettes.
Bey, tu dois lui parler.
Papa, commence pas.
Tu m'as toujours dit
que tu avais quitté l'école en 6ème,
pour bosser dans la rue
avec Avon et Stringer,
gagner ton pain pour la famille,
comment t'es devenu un homme...
Ça va, ça va. Tu as raison.
Je te jette pas la pierre.
Mais je dis juste...
Tu sais comment est ta mère,
à faire des histoires.
Tu devrais lever le pied.
T'as entendu que Marlo a eu Bodie ?
Soit il travaillait pour lui,
soit il abandonnait son coin.
Cet enfoiré a cédé.
Tu aurais fait ça autrement ?
Ouais, je me serais pas dégonflé,
comme toi.
J'ai mon 9 mm.
J'emmerde Chris et sa bande.
Écoute-toi, à jouer les caïds.
Tu serais parti tout seul
avec ton flingue
pour affronter la moitié
des quartiers ouest.
Tu es bien intentionné
et je respecte ça plus que tout.
Mais le bordel là-bas ? C'est pas
comme quand on a commencé.
De notre temps, un type comme Marlo
qui sortait du rang,
à violer les règles, il se retrouvait
dans le coffre d'une voiture
en route vers Leakin Park.
Sans aucun doute.
On faisait ça bien.
La parole était un contrat.
Les mecs veillaient sur les leurs,
sur leur famille.
C'était ça, d'où je viens.
Aujourd'hui, tout ça est mort.
Ces marches.
- Merci, mon beau.
- C'est bon.
Dis "Omar".
Rien ?
On a vérifié
des deux côtés de la rue
- d'ici jusqu'à Monroe.
- Rien ?
Rien d'anormal pour un égout.
D'autres idées ?
"Blood, vire-moi
ce Black de la rue".
"L'enculé dans la Bruick ?"
"Celui-là. Mon principe :
aucun branleur se tire
avec mon héros".
C'est vraiment génial.
Avec quelqu'un qui lit sur les lèvres,
cet enfoiré est fini.
C'est légal
d'intercepter leurs conversations ?
Fais pas ton Freamon.
Merde, je dois y aller.
Pourquoi tu me remplacerais pas ?
Je suis là depuis ce matin.
T'es au courant ?
Ils font un film.
Oui. Comment tu veux la jouer ?
Je suis pas sûr.
Allons voir le gros.
Et pour l'autre truc ?
Tout roule.
Salut, mec.
- Si tu veux, j'ai des Reeses.
- Non.
Tu veux te faire
de la vraie thune ? 5 $ ?
- Tu cherches quoi ?
- Moi et Paul, on va s'amuser avec Tiff.
Fais le guetteur, pour que Mme D.
nous surprenne pas, tu vois ?
Ouais, mais j'ai une commande
spéciale pour des 6èmes.
Fais-les attendre.
On n'en a pas pour toute la journée.
Ça roule.
Non, madame, je lis ici que Son Honneur
a demandé au service des déchets
de ramasser les ordures sur Tivoly.
Ils ont mis six mois à venir.
Oui, personne n'est parfait.
Mais je ne serais pas là
si je ne pensais pas
que Clarence Royce s'implique
pour cette ville et ses habitants.
Et la criminalité dans le quartier ?
C'est un autre bon argument.
Mais, madame, entre nous,
je sais à votre voix que vous êtes noire
et vous savez que je suis blanc.
Alors je voudrais vous demander,
quand un blanc a-t-il voté
pour un Noir,
alors qu'il y avait
un autre candidat blanc ?
Je sais pas,
mais vous devez croire en lui.
C'est bien ce que je dis.
C'est le meilleur candidat.
- Alors vous voterez pour lui ?
- J'y réfléchirai.
C'est super.
Merci pour votre temps.
- J'ai un laissez-passer.
- Tant mieux pour toi.
- J'ai le mien.
- Bien joué.
Tu cherches des corps, Lester...
En voilà.
On a un mandat et un télex
pour mon petit Lex.
Mort ou vivant,
il est dans nos dossiers.
Sinon, il est temps pour toi
d'utiliser ton intelligence supérieure
sur de vrais meurtres.
Laisse tomber les meurtres supposés.
J'imagine que tu as raison.
C'est ma préoccupation : le crime.
Je comprends complètement
votre point de vue.
Si vous m'en donnez la chance,
je pourrai vous aider,
vous et les autres gens de ce quartier.
M. Ricks,
- merci pour votre temps et attention.
- De rien.
Plutôt culotté de serrer la main
de l'ennemi en plein jour.
- Y'a pas trop de public.
- C'est sûr que non.
Et pourtant, vous êtes ici,
à frapper à toutes les portes.
Les chaussures,
c'est notre arme secrète.
Vous m'avez surpris en transformant
l'élection en course.
Je pense que vous ne passiez pas
par hasard dans le quartier.
Watkins va lâcher le maire.
Comment le savez-vous ?
Je le sais. J'ai couvert le maire
parce que j'y étais obligé.
J'adorerais voir du sang neuf
dans cette ville.
Et j'adorerais faire
quelque chose de bien
pour le département de police,
pour changer.
Attends qu'il tourne.
Au bureau de district de Watkins.
Sur Gilmore Street.
Oublie les feux rouges !
C'est pas un endroit
où on s'attend à trouver des gangsters.
Ou la police, d'ailleurs.
- Tu savais un truc que je savais pas.
- Je te l'ai déjà dit :
c'est mon business
de garder les oreilles ouvertes.
C'est mon business
de faire du business.
On fait du business
ou on fait que causer ?
Si on fait que causer, je me casse.
J'ai entendu que les gars
qui surveillaient ta partie de carte
étaient pas trop contents
de leurs payes.
C'était juste une question de temps
avant qu'ils trouvent le moyen
de se faire payer correctement.
Et tu ne m'as rien dit ?
C'est en se brûlant
qu'on sait que c'est chaud.
Comment je sais
que tu me baratines pas ?
Tu le sais pas.
Il se passe des trucs dans la rue.
Les preuves sont dures à trouver.
Vas-y, ouvre-la.
En dehors de la rue,
il y a pleins de preuves.
Ils vont les exécuter vendredi.
Pour les coordonner
avec les élections, sans doute,
montrer qu'ils font leur boulot,
en nettoyant la ville,
en coffrant un caïd.
- Comment tu as eu ça ?
- Comme je te l'ai déjà dit,
je garde les oreilles ouvertes.
- Tu vas en faire quoi ?
- Peut-être rien.
Charlie ne fait pas partie
du regroupement.
Ou je pourrais lui vendre le tuyau.
Selon toi, combien
un homme avec plein d'argent
paierait pour sa liberté ?
Ces derniers temps,
j'ai appris qu'on prenait
des images de moi.
Des images ?
Des vidéos.
Tu as entendu quelque chose
à ce sujet ?
Je n'avais pas de raison d'écouter.
Maintenant, t'en as une.
Oublier les primaires
est une chose.
C'en est une autre de...
trahir Clarence Royce.
- Certainement.
- Et même si je sautais le pas,
pourquoi je n'irais pas
avec Tony Gray ?
Au moins, on a les mêmes origines.
Tony ne peut pas gagner. Moi si.
En vérité,
quoi que je vous offre, le maire
vous en offrira autant, voire le double.
J'ai une organisation assez populaire,
mais c'est sans comparaison
avec l'argent qu'il a.
Je proposerai
tous ceux que vous voudrez.
Je sais que vous voulez Daniels
dans le 11e et Stokes dans le 10e.
Je ne toucherai pas
ceux que je risque de couler.
Je sais que je suis pas une affaire
pour les gens de votre côté de la ville.
Mais, à une semaine des primaires,
le fait est que Royce et moi
avons tous les deux besoin de vous.
Après l'élection, ceci changera
pour lui, pas pour moi.
Je serai un maire blanc
dans une ville à majorité noire.
Si je veux agir,
et M. le délégué,
je compte bien restaurer cette ville,
je devrai diriger par consensus.
Si vous me soutenez, vous aurez
une voix dans mon administration,
simplement
parce que j'en aurai besoin.
Selon le dernier sondage
que Clarence m'a montré,
il menait de sept points.
Foutaises.
Je suis à moins de quatre.
- T'auras pas besoin de ça.
- Je sais.
- C'est ici ?
- Ouais, c'est ici.
Merde.
- Éteins L'ampoule doit trop chauffer.
- Ou les batteries lâchent.
On devrait rentrer.
- Ça pue, mec.
- C'était pas comme ça.
Tu vois, il bouge pas.
Y'a du sang collé
dans ses cheveux.
- Il est mort ?
- Il est mort.
Lex aussi.
Il est mort.
Ils sont tous morts. Rassuré ?
Donut avait tort.
Y'a pas de morts spéciaux.
Quand t'es mort, t'es mort.
Ce dimanche,
avant les primaires,
avant que nous n'allions aux urnes
exercer notre droit de vote bťni,
une leÁon nous vient de l'Exode,
chapitre 18.
"Et cela arriva le lendemain,
MoÔse s'assit pour juger le peuple
et le peuple se tint devant lui
depuis le matin jusqu'au soir.
Et MoÔse jugea le peuple
et il supporta ce terrible fardeau
complŤtement seul.
Et un jour, son beau-pŤre lui dit :
'MoÔse, pourquoi portes-tu
cette ťnorme responsabilitť seul ?
Il te faut d'autres hommes sages
qui t'aideront ŗ conduire
justement le peuple'.
MoÔse ťcouta la voix
de son beau-pŤre
et choisit des hommes capables
pour conduire le peuple".
Puis-je prÍcher
comme je le ressens ?
Ce mardi,
quand nous choisirons
les hommes et les femmes
qui dirigeront cette ville,
nous ferions bien de garder
ces standards en tÍte.
Des hommes honnÍtes
qui craignent Dieu
et haÔssent la convoitise.
Que Dieu vous bťnisse.
Content de vous voir.
Comment allez-vous ?
- TrŤs bien.
- Et votre maman ?
- Passez-lui le bonjour.
- Rťunion de diocŤse ŗ 14h00 ?
- Si je suis en retard...
- Nous attendrons.
Merci d'Ítre venus,
jeune homme, jeune fille.
- Rťvťrend.
- Monsieur.
Mme Carcetti.
Comment allez-vous ?
Merci de votre accueil.
- Merci ŗ vous.
- Un sermon intťressant.
D'aprŤs les sondages,
vous avez une chance.
Nous sommes dans la marge d'erreur.
Marge d'erreur.
C'est une phrase intťressante.
Je vois que le dťlťguť Watkins
occupe le terrain pour vous.
J'espŤre qu'il ne sera pas le seul.
Je vais vous dire, Monsieur.
Je vais garder l'esprit ouvert
jusqu'au bureau de vote, mardi.
- Et si vous gagnez...
- Vous placez la barre un peu haut.
MoÔse ?
Nom de Dieu, Rťvťrend...
Dťsolť.
Je ne voulais pas dire Áa.
MoÔse suffit pour l'instant.
Gardons Dieu
pour votre deuxiŤme mandat.
Bonne continuation.
Merci beaucoup d'Ítre venus.
SUR …COUTE
"Laissez-nous faire".
- Des signes de vie ?
- Pas un chat.
- Ils sont peut-Ítre ŗ l'ťglise.
- Notre-Dame de la Rťappro ?
Il finira bien par se montrer.
Appelle-moi.
Votez pour Carcetti.
Votez pour Carcetti mardi.
Tommy Carcetti, je me prťsente
comme maire.
Bonjour, Monsieur.
J'ai suivi votre campagne.
Je suis enseignante.
- Formidable.
- J'enseigne la biologie au lycťe.
- Ici, dans cette ville ?
- Dans le comtť de Baltimore.
Je trouve votre position sur la rťforme
du systŤme ťducatif
- trŤs encourageante.
- Vous voterez pour moi, alors ?
Si je vivais en ville, absolument.
- Bonne chance pour mardi.
- Merci.
C'est que des gens du comtť, bordel !
On a presque fini de toute faÁon.
- Thomas, regardez Áa.
- C'est quoi ?
Regardez.
Dans le privť, vous avez dťjŗ
reprťsentť un certain Bobby Harrison ?
Le profiteur des pauvres ?
Non !
Je l'ai jamais rencontrť.
"Carcetti a ťcartť
les charges sťrieuses
et a rťduit les autres
ŗ de petites amendes.
Le profiteur s'en sort encore
avec une tape sur la main,
alors que des centaines de locataires
vivent dans la misŤre".
Calomnie de derniŤre minute.
Ils ont la trouille.
- Royce.
- Qui d'autre ?
65% des loyers de la ville.
Bobby Harrison est la honte
de cette ville.
Deux jours avant les ťlections,
ils me calomnient ?
Sur les marches du Palais.
«a ťtť pris quand ?
- La photo est truquťe.
- On a le temps de le prouver ?
- On peut essayer.
- Mon cul.
- Je vais perdre ŗ cause de Áa.
- Du calme, Tommy.
On savait qu'ils sortiraient
une saloperie ŗ la derniŤre minute.
Maintenant, on sait ce que c'est.
Merde.
N'oublie pas que
tu reprťsentes ton pŤre.
Ouais, je sais.
Pourquoi elle veut nous voir ?
Elle a peut-Ítre un truc spťcial
en tÍte pour toi, mon garÁon.
- Cool.
- C'est une Barksdale.
Elle sait reconnaÓtre le talent.
En plus, ils doivent beaucoup
ŗ cette famille.
Ton papa,
il a tout encaissť ŗ leur place.
Je sais. C'est un soldat.
- Tel pŤre, tel fils.
- C'est sŻr.
- Quelle heure t'as ?
- 15h30.
Ce connard est en retard.
C'est pour toi, Marlo.
Dis-moi tout.
«a me va.
Du moment qu'elle arrive ŗ destination,
on est bons.
ņ quelle heure je dois passer prendre
la maigrichonne ?
Ils ont dit quelle heure ?
Demain soir.
Elle sera dans le train de 20h45
venant de New York.
On peut s'en occuper.
Non. Je vais le faire.
Je veux pas d'embrouilles.
T'en es sŻr ?
Pas de lťzard.
Pas besoin de t'en mÍler.
Celui-lŗ aussi, je peux l'avoir.
Marlo Stanfield.
Il est pas si fort.
Il se sert de portables et tout.
Qu'est-ce qu'il dit, lŗ ?
"ņ quelle heure je dois passer prendre
la maigrichonne ?
Je vais le faire.
Je veux pas d'embrouilles".
Il va peut-Ítre rťcupťrer sa copine ?
"Maigrichonne de New York" ?
C'est un code. CocaÔne.
La vache. Marlo en personne
si prŤs de la marchandise...
C'est un minable.
Je te l'avais dit.
- Alors comment on rťagit ?
- On fait un dťmenti.
C'est pour Áa qu'on paye un imprimeur.
Vaudrait mieux retrouver
la photo originale.
Si on prouve que c'est un montage...
J'ai pas bossť au "Sun"
pendant 22 ans
sans m'y faire des relations.
Je vais appeler Paul McCardle
de la photothŤque.
Et si on la trouve pas ?
On sort un montage aussi,
montrant Royce dans un motel avec
une fille morte et un garÁon en vie.
On ne peut pas contre-attaquer.
Plus maintenant.
Du calme. Je plaisante.
Retourne ŗ ton planning.
Fais toutes tes visites.
Va ŗ ce dÓner de charitť ce soir
et sois gentil.
On va s'occuper de Áa.
Tu peux pas nous faire Áa.
Bey vous a tous couverts.
Et vous avez ťtť largement indemnisťs.
- Mais les temps changent.
- Pas pour Bey.
Ce que je veux dire,
c'est que l'argent ne rentre plus.
On ne fait plus d'affaires.
Avon n'est plus lŗ.
Ses gars non plus.
Merde.
T'as l'air de pas trop mal t'en tirer.
Je ne peux rien faire
de plus pour vous.
Bey sait tout. T'as oubliť Áa ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il va faire ?
ņ qui va-t-il le dire ?
Qu'est-ce que j'en ai ŗ faire,
s'il le fait ?
Bey ne m'a jamais entendue dire
un seul mot sur les affaires.
Et ton frŤre ?
Avon pourrait Ítre parti
plus longtemps, si Bey raconte tout.
Je me contrefous d'Avon.
Je voulais que
vous l'appreniez de moi,
comme Áa, il n'y a pas
de mensonges entre nous.
Elle a reÁu tellement de fric
depuis deux ans
que tu devrais avoir
de quoi voir venir, mon garÁon.
Ton pŤre a ťtť traitť avec respect.
On vous a donnť ce qu'on avait
ŗ tous les deux.
Mais rien ne dure toujours.
Une balance en prison ?
Il a appelť la nuit derniŤre.
Worden lui a parlť.
Si on passe un marchť,
il nous rťsout l'enquÍte.
- Sans dťconner.
- Je vais ťcrire un mandat,
l'envoyer au bureau du procureur
pour qu'ils le signent
dŤs demain matin.
- Qu'est-ce qui presse ?
- Si on fait vite,
Áa foutra une merde noire
juste avant les ťlections.
Si ce type sait vraiment
pourquoi le tťmoin... son nom ?
- Braddock.
- ... a ťtť tuť...
Ce serait mauvais pour le maire.
Sinon ce sera mauvais
pour le petit blanc, Carcetti.
Tu te soucies d'un des deux ?
J'en ai rien ŗ branler des deux !
Je vote mÍme pas.
Mais Áa m'amuse de baiser
ces connards en costumes.
Tu seras peut-Ítre
au journal du soir.
Tu leur rendras la monnaie
de leur piŤce.
ņ seulement deux jours
des primaires,
les reprťsentants des candidats
ont eu de vifs ťchanges
au sujet de tracts polťmiques
distribuťs dans certains
quartiers afro-amťricains.
Ce qui semblait Ítre une avance
confortable pour le maire sortant
s'est ťvaporťe en quelques jours.
Le dernier sondage du "Sun"
montre deux hommes
au coude ŗ coude
avec Tony Gray ŗ la traÓne.
4 % des ťlecteurs potentiels
sont toujours indťcis,
et avec les prim...
J'ai h‚te que ce soit fini.
Ouais, moi aussi.
Ce tract peut te nuire ?
On a trouvť la photo originale
dans les archives du "Sun".
Ils ont collť ma tronche ŗ cŰtť
d'un criminel libťrť
sur les marches du Palais.
Je suis ŗ la place
d'un shťrif adjoint.
Mon Dieu.
Quel milieu sordide.
Royce jure qu'il n'a rien ŗ voir
lŗ-dedans.
Pour lui, c'est l'úuvre
d'un indťpendant.
Norman et Terri disent
de ne pas s'inquiťter.
«a fait partie du jeu.
Quand j'avais 15 points de retard,
je m'ťtais rťsignť.
 tre battu ŗ plate couture,
je peux l'accepter.
ņ quoi peut-on s'attendre d'autre,
de toute faÁon ?
Un blanc candidat ŗ la mairie
de Baltimore ?
Mais Áa ?
Jen, si je perds de deux points,
Áa va me tuer.
«a va me foutre en l'air.
Il faut que tu prennes la relŤve, Nay.
Sois l'homme de la famille.
Tu es plus ‚gť que ton pŤre
quand il a commencť dans la rue.
J'arrÍte pas de le dire.
Merde. Il a arrÍtť l'ťcole.
Tu arrÍtes pas l'ťcole.
Pas encore.
Mais tu vas te mettre ŗ ton compte.
Tu vas demander un paquet ŗ Bodie.
Et s'il refuse ?
Je n'accepte pas qu'on me dise non.
- Tu viens de le faire.
- De quoi tu parles ?
- Avec Brianna.
- Passe-moi le tťlťphone.
Pourquoi elle a dit que tu avais eu
suffisamment d'argent ?
C'est une sale menteuse, Namond.
Tu vois ?
Il y a plein de choses
que tu ignores encore.
Elle sait bien
que tu vas pas balancer.
- MÍme si elle fout la merde.
- «a, c'est sŻr.
Elle profite de toi, Bey.
Elle profite de toi.
On dirait qu'elle a pensť ŗ tout.
Ouais, cette salope a pensť ŗ tout.
Elle nous jette sans prťavis. Rien.
C'est comme rentrer chez soi
et trouver ses affaires dans la rue.
Elle en a rien foutre de toi,
d'Avon, de tout.
Elle a eu le toupet de me dire
qu'elle allait
mettre les choses au clair
pour pas que je mente.
Jen, je suis dťsolť.
Il a dit qu'il serait debout.
Il est dťjŗ parti au bureau.
Qu'est-ce qu'il fait lŗ-bas ?
Il n'arrivait pas ŗ dormir.
Il y est depuis des heures.
Merde. ņ plus tard.
Comme on manque toujours
de policiers volontaires
pour donner un coup de main
dans les bureaux de vote,
nous demandons aux intťressťs
de contacter le service tactique
cet aprŤs-midi.
DeuxiŤme point sur la liste :
des mandats d'arrÍt tous frais
pour homicide et dťtention d'arme
sur un certain Omar Little.
Quelqu'un connaÓt cet enfoirť ?
- Il a tuť qui ?
- Une femme dans un magasin.
- Une honnÍte citoyenne.
- Une honnÍte citoyenne ?
Apparemment,
il est accusť d'un meurtre
qui a eu lieu
pendant un cambriolage.
«a fait un paquet de fois
qu'on a un mandat sur cet enculť.
On a ni adresse prťcise
ni rťsidence connue.
Mais si on le chope,
il faut contacter les inspecteurs
Holley et Crutchfield.
Vous voulez Omar Little ?
Vous cherchez un dealer
qui se barre d'un coin de rue
en chiant dans son froc.
T'as dťjŗ vu Omar se faire un civil ?
En attendant, faites circuler Áa.
- Bon Dieu, Tommy.
- Je lis les derniŤres donnťes.
- J'ai modifiť l'agenda.
- Un peu de bon sens...
Quelques quartiers
de la classe moyenne noire
penchent pour Tony,
mais sont encore indťcis.
On peut gagner quelques voix
dans ces quartiers...
Ces gens dťtestent le maire.
Tu vas les avoir,
- sinon, Gray les aura.
- On fait du porte ŗ porte aujourd'hui.
Tant qu'elles vont pas ŗ Royce...
Il me faut des voix noires
pour devenir maire.
J'ai besoin de la confiance
de cette communautť.
Si je me faufile
avec une petite majoritť...
On peut vraiment gagner.
Pourquoi tu crois que j'ai pas dormi ?
Sans manquer de respect
envers ta petite analyse matinale,
on a trois interviews radio d'affilťe.
J'ai dŻ supplier pour les avoir.
Les gens qui gŤrent ta campagne
sont des pros, Tommy.
Laisse-nous faire.
Il y aura sŻrement un travail pour toi
dans l'administration Carcetti.
Chargť des relations publiques.
Monte dans la voiture.
Duquan ?
M. Prez.
Suis-moi, s'il te plaÓt.
J'ai fait quoi ?
Si tu arrives plus tŰt,
je t'ouvre et tu peux te doucher.
Et mes affaires sales ?
Tu les mets dans ce sac,
tu les laisses dans le casier,
je les ramŤne chez moi
et je les lave.
Vas-y, lave-toi.
Tu vas Ítre en retard pour les cours.
Paul. Monnel.
Salope.
Elle est bonne, en tout cas.
T'as raison.
Tiff, bťbť.
Moi aussi, j'ai 50 cents.
Allez vous faire foutre.
Merde. Les trois ensemble ?
Tu savais qu'elle pouvait.
Je savais que tu pouvais.
Repos.
Je dťteste quand les chefs s'aventurent
en dessous du huitiŤme ťtage.
Donne-moi juste un moment
pour dťtendre mon anus.
L'affaire Braddock.
C'est en bonne voie.
Norris et Greggs la dťmÍlent.
Je le sais dťjŗ.
Le prťfet Burrell a eu
une visite ce matin
du procureur Demper lui-mÍme,
demandant pourquoi
un jour avant les primaires,
nos inspecteurs essaient de rendre
visite ŗ une balance en prison.
Le tuyau est venu tout seul.
J'ai rien fait
pour le forcer ni le bloquer.
Advienne que pourra.
Exactement.
Eh bien, vous pourrez aller
vous faire foutre.
Si Braddock a ťtť tuť
parce que c'ťtait un tťmoin
et que nous rťsolvons l'affaire
un jour avant les primaires,
Royce nous en voudra ŗ vie.
Et il pourrait bien gagner cette ťlection.
Si Braddock a ťtť tuť
pour une autre raison
et que nous le prouvons aujourd'hui,
alors on aura Carcetti au cul.
Et Carcetti pourrait bien gagner.
Je vous suis.
On me dit qu'il nous manque
encore 20 gars
pour s'occuper des bureaux de vote.
Je veux que vous dťtachiez
deux inspecteurs
en service spťcial pour les ťlections.
Je vais deviner : Norris et Greggs.
«a me convient.
Ils doivent se prťsenter au service
tactique ŗ 13h00
pour Ítre briefťs sur l'ťlection.
Ils pourront avoir leur mandat
et parler ŗ leur balance mercredi.
La dťmocratie amťricaine.
Donnons l'exemple ŗ ces attardťs
du Tiers-Monde.
Je crois avoir de bonnes nouvelles
pour vous tous.
Nous allons mettre en place
le programme pilote
de l'Universitť du Maryland.
Tu ne prends que trois
de mes dťcťrťbrťs ?
Il y a un maximum
de 10 enfants de 3Ťme
dans cette classe pilote.
Huit garÁons et deux filles.
- Si tout se passe bien...
- C'est un bon dťbut.
- Quand ?
- Ce matin.
C'est pas trop tŰt.
- J'ťtais comment ?
- Bien dans les interviews de ce matin.
Tu t'es bien dťbrouillť
au sujet des tracts.
Putain de Royce.
Si je perds ŗ cause de ces conneries...
Si tu perds, Áa peut venir
de 10 diffťrentes raisons.
Pareil si tu gagnes.
Devine qui je viens
d'avoir au tťlťphone ?
Le sťnateur Davis.
Il veut nous voir.
Davis ? Pourquoi je voudrais
m'allier ŗ cet enculť ?
Il n'a pas ťtť explicite,
mais on dirait qu'il est prÍt
ŗ suivre Watkins et ŗ l‚cher le maire.
Que veut-il en ťchange ?
Comme d'habitude.
Au moins 20 000 $ pour son comitť
de campagne favori, je suppose.
Peut-Ítre mÍme 30 000.
Clay n'est pas donnť.
Je ne lui promettrai rien
politiquement.
Tu crois que Clay Davis s'embarrasse
de promesses politiques ?
Non, il s'agit
d'un ťchange de services.
Il pourrait nous escroquer.
Prendre notre argent
et oublier de tenir parole.
Peut-Ítre. Dans ce cas, tout ce
qu'on aurait perdu, c'est de l'argent.
«a pourrait Ítre le coup de pouce
dont on a besoin dans le quartier ouest.
Arrange Áa.
C'est dťjŗ fait.
- Inversez le dťnominateur...
- «a veut dire quoi, "inverser" ?
Le numťrateur et le dťnominateur
ťchangent leurs places.
- On bascule les deux.
- Pourquoi vous faites Áa ?
Parce que Áa marche.
C'est la formule.
Excusez-moi, M. Pryzbylewski.
Namond Brice, Darnell Tyson
et Zenobia Dawson.
Prenez vos affaires
et suivez-nous, s'il vous plaÓt.
Silence, silence.
Calmez-vous, s'il vous plaÓt.
- On a fait quoi ? On a des ennuis ?
- Venez avec moi.
Merde. C'est l'histoire de ma vie.
Ils reviendront pas.
M. Prezbo, on les arrÍte ?
Nay, je peux avoir ta X-box ?
Lŗ-bas, t'en auras pas besoin.
Ils ont fait quoi ?
Markeith, Kwame et Latonya.
Prenez vos affaires
et venez avec nous.
Encore ?
Je ne peux pas
vous soutenir publiquement.
Pas aussi tardivement.
Alors de quoi parlez-vous ?
Je ne ferai pas ce que j'ai l'habitude
de faire le jour des ťlections.
Je vous regarderai gagner des points
dans les 7 e et 9e districts,
et mÍme dans ce coin du 11e,
ŗ l'ouest de Freemont.
Je partage avec vous
mes appuis locaux.
Je partage mon argent
de persuasion.
Vous voyez, un ťchange
de bons procťdťs.
La politique est une bonne chose,
partenaire.
C'est une idťe peu partagťe.
Commandons.
J'ai assez faim pour manger les grands
chevaux sur lesquels vous Ítes arrivťs.
Si vous voulez bien,
nous sommes trop occupťs
- pour un dťjeuner.
- J'en doute pas.
Laissez assez d'argent
pour l'addition.
Non, elle est cinglťe.
Elle dit que tu y ťtais.
J'y ťtais pas. C'ťtait pas un viol.
- Elle ťtait d'accord.
- Comment le sais-tu ? Tu n'y ťtais pas.
Je l'ai vue rentrer avec eux.
Rentrer avec qui ?
ArrÍte de faire le malin,
jeune homme.
Tu as de gros problŤmes.
Avec qui tu l'as vue rentrer
dans les toilettes des garÁons ?
Paul et Monnel.
Et que faisais-tu ?
- Je surveillais.
- Alors tu es impliquť.
Mais j'ai rien vu.
Tu faisais le guet.
Non, ťcoutez,
Monnel m'a donnť 5 $.
Il m'a dit de rester devant la porte
et de le prťvenir si quelqu'un arrivait.
C'est pas juste.
J'ai rien fait.
Tu fais le guet
pendant que deux garÁons de 3Ťme
violent une fille de 3Ťme.
Mais elle ťtait d'accord.
Ce n'est pas ce que dit Tiffanie.
Il va y avoir une enquÍte.
Tu seras suspendu.
Tu pourrais mÍme Ítre renvoyť.
Il y aura peut-Ítre mÍme
des poursuites criminelles.
Madame, je vous en prie, non.
Mme Donnelly, n'appelez pas ma mŤre
adoptive. Je vous dirai tout ce que je sais.
Je sais dťjŗ tout.
Non, mais je sais d'autres trucs.
Je sais qui a volť
dans la salle des profs,
qui a taguť les vestiaires ou...
- Mlle Jeffries, je vous prie.
- Mme Donnelly...
Ici Mme Donnelly,
de Tilghman Middle.
…coutez... je sais...
Le gars qui a crevť
les pneus de M. Philmont ?
Je sais qui c'est.
Je suis au courant d'un meurtre.
C'est vrai.
Nous avons identifiť
quelques ťlŤves
qui pourraient bťnťficier
d'un cursus spťcial
et de classes ŗ effectifs rťduits.
Nous avons choisi
10 ťlŤves de 3Ťme
pour participer ŗ ce programme.
Si on est choisi, on doit y aller ?
- C'est Áa.
- Et si on veut pas ?
C'est obligatoire.
Nous pensons que ce programme
sera bťnťfique pour tout le monde.
Vous aurez l'attention
dont vous avez besoin.
Et on foutra pas la merde
pour les autres.
Pardon. Je voulais pas jurer.
Mais tu as raison.
Si cette classe foire,
ce sera ŗ cause de vous seuls.
- Alors on nous sort de classe.
- C'est aussi une classe.
Chacun de vous a prouvť
ŗ maintes reprises
qu'il n'ťtait pas prÍt
pour une classe normale.
Mais ce programme pilote,
si vous y souscrivez,
va vous prťparer.
Nous prťparer pour la prison.
Ouais, c'est la prison.
On dirait mÍme l'isolement.
- C'est vrai.
- L'isolement.
C'est bien, fiston.
C'est bien de l'isolement.
C'est bien le trou, ici.
C'est un bon petit.
Vraiment.
DŤs que vous aurez passť cet appel,
son nom figurera dans le systŤme.
Que puis-je faire? Il dit
qu'il est au courant d'un meurtre.
Je dois avertir la police.
Laissez-moi appeler quelqu'un
en qui j'ai confiance.
C'est lui, lŗ-bas.
Prťparez-vous.
Tu veux pas Ítre dans le coup ?
Serrez-le vous-mÍme,
il croira ŗ un contrŰle de routine
et je pourrais le surprendre
en audience prťliminaire.
Bonsoir, mesdames et messieurs,
votre attention, s'il vous plaÓt.
Embarquement
ŗ la porte D, voie 4,
pour l'express de 20h45
en provenance de New York,
faisant halte ŗ la gare de BWI
et en direction de Union Station,
Washington.
Ma súur, je vous aide
avec votre sac ?
- Non, merci.
- N'ayez pas peur.
Pourquoi j'aurais peur ?
Qui Ítes-vous ?
Je vous accompagne
jusqu'ŗ la porte.
Mon mari attend dehors.
Je serai ravi de le rencontrer.
Je l'attends avec vous.
Vous serez en sťcuritť.
«a n'est vraiment pas la peine.
- Police ferroviaire.
- Venez par ici, s'il vous plaÓt.
- C'est quoi, Áa ?
- Donnez-moi le sac.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Je ne connais pas cet homme.
Oý m'emmenez-vous?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il a dit ?
- Pas grand-chose.
De la drogue ?
Je ne l'ai pas vraiment interrogť.
Un meurtre.
Je devrais transmettre l'info.
Qui sait ce qu'il sait vraiment ?
Je veux pas le voir
se faire broyer par le systŤme.
Je vais essayer de garder Áa
entre nous.
Je vais le confier ŗ quelqu'un
qui sait rester discret.
Je vous suis reconnaissant.
Carver.
Ellis a fait du chemin.
Je crois que c'est l'homme
de la situation.
Pourquoi cela vous tient tant ŗ cúur ?
Ce mŰme, c'est qui pour vous ?
Je ne sais pas.
C'est un des mes ťlŤves.
Sergent.
Ils sont en rŤgle tous les deux.
Quoi ?
Il n'y avait rien dans le sac
mis ŗ part des vÍtements fťminins.
Rien ŗ signaler sur l'un ou l'autre.
Si vous n'avez pas d'autre idťe,
on doit les rel‚cher.
D'aprŤs ce qu'il dit,
il ťtait juste un intermťdiaire.
Il a remis un message.
Il a dit ŗ la victime d'Ítre
ŗ un endroit ŗ une heure prťcise.
Alors comment il le sait ?
Il dit que tout le monde sait
ce qui est arrivť ŗ Lex.
«a se sait dans la rue.
Et cette autre chose ŗ l'ťcole ?
Je vous jure que j'ai rien fait,
Mlle Anna.
J'ai rien fait, vous verrez.
L'ťcole s'occupera de Áa,
nous allons nous occuper du meurtre.
Tant que Randy coopťrera,
qu'il dira la vťritť...
- Mais si Áa se sait...
- Je comprends.
C'est pour Áa qu'il va aller ŗ l'ťcole,
la bouche cousue,
le nez propre
et s'occuper de ses affaires.
Il a fait preuve de mauvais jugement
dans les deux cas.
Je suis d'accord.
Mais de ce que j'en sais,
ce n'est pas un mauvais gosse.
Dennis ?
Oý tu vas, si tŰt ?
Je vais courir et aprŤs,
je dois tondre une pelouse.
Tu vas revenir, hein ?
Comment Áa, je vais revenir ?
C'est comme Áa, hein ?
Comme quoi ?
- On va oý ?
- Highlandtown.
On va agrandir ta base,
petit soldat.
- Quoi de neuf, Spider ?
- Salut, petit.
Merci, mais je sais pour qui voter.
Je vais Ítre en retard au travail.
Mlle Anna, je peux rester ici
pendant que vous votez ?
Ne va pas traÓner.
Alors, mec ?
Combien ils te payent pour Áa ?
Ils disent 40, mais je dois
travailler toute la journťe.
Tu vois le truc ?
C'ťtait Spider, non ?
Il est allť oý ?
Non merci.
Je peux pas voter.
Condamnation ? Crime ?
Dťgage.
Si tu revois Spider,
tu lui diras de passer au gymnase.
«a fait des semaines qu'il vient pas.
On doit discuter, d'accord ?
- Oý est le grand ?
- Je sais pas.
T'es engagť.
Mets Áa dans toutes les mains
que tu vois.
Merci beaucoup.
Pourquoi t'es pas ŗ l'ťcole ?
Y'a pas ťcole aujourd'hui.
- Encore une fÍte juive ?
- Les ťlections.
- Alors tu vas faire quoi ?
- Je sais pas. TraÓner.
Tu te rappelles que
tu dois prendre la relŤve ?
Brianna a fermť le robinet.
C'est ŗ nous de faire couler l'eau.
Je vais m'habiller et on va voir Bodie.
Gamin, j'ai autre chose pour toi.
Mets-en sur chaque porte
entre l'autoroute et Winchester,
et de Freemont ŗ Fulton.
Tu peux le faire seul
ou avec des amis,
mais je veux que ce soit fait
pour cet aprŤs-midi.
Une sur chaque porte. Cool.
C'est pour la journťe de travail.
C'est de l'argent de poche.
Mais ne me dťÁois pas.
«a m'a pris du temps.
C'est quoi, tout Áa ?
Il m'a dit que si je mettais
tous ces tracts, je serai payť.
Je rentre ŗ la maison aprŤs.
Tu as plutŰt intťrÍt.
Tu ne traÓneras plus dans ces rues.
Elle a l'air sťrieuse.
Le journal du soir, hein ?
Ferme-la.
Je me tape ce boulot ŗ la con
parce que t'as voulu remuer la merde.
Et demain, si on se remet
sur l'affaire Braddock,
personne n'en aura rien ŗ foutre.
Tout est question de timing.
Sans blague, ducon.
Tommy Carcetti.
Comment allez-vous ?
Il est mignon.
Tommy Carcetti.
J'espŤre que vous allez voter.
Bien sŻr.
Ce sera pour qui ?
Un indice, allez.
Ne me faites pas languir.
Ne vous faites pas de soucis
pour moi.
Je vous remercie.
Tommy Carcetti,
candidat ŗ la mairie.
Enchantť.
- BientŰt fini ?
- On peut y aller.
D'autres endroits nous attendent.
Tommy Carcetti.
J'ai connu votre pŤre.
Le club dťmocratique du 1er district.
- Vraiment ?
- Vous avez mon vote.
Ils ont eu leur chance.
Regardez ce qu'est devenue la ville.
J'espŤre changer les choses.
Merci pour votre soutien.
Tous les politiciens
sont des voleurs...
- C'est faux.
- «a fait partie du jeu, je le sais bien.
Mais on a pris un dollar sur trois,
pas deux sur trois,
comme ces nťgros.
Il faut bien laisser quelque chose
ŗ la ville, bon Dieu.
J'ai pas raison ?
Bonne chance, Monsieur.
"Nťgros" ?
Dťsolť.
Des tracts pour les ťlections ?
Ouais, on fait vite,
on les met dans les boÓtes
sur les portes et tout Áa,
peu importe.
- Et pour les maisons vides ?
- On est pas obligťs de les faire.
Dans certains coins, y'a que Áa.
C'est bien ce que je dis.
C'est de l'argent facile.
Vous voulez pas ?
- Moi, si.
- Moi aussi.
Ce serait plus facile
avec une voiture.
J'ai assez de problŤmes
avec Mlle Anna comme Áa.
Et toi, Mike ? Tu viens ?
Je te vois plus tard.
…coutez, Namond a ťtť...
Comment dire ?
Son travail est inťgal.
Parfois, il fait Áa bien
et d'autres fois, il est...
Nous en avons discutť.
Il va faire mieux.
N'est-ce pas ?
Spťcial ťlections ! Deux pour deux !
- Je sais pas.
- Moi, si.
Tu vas donner un paquet
ŗ ce garÁon
ou il y aura du grabuge.
Tu veux que j'en parle ŗ Wee-Bey ?
Ou tu prťfŤres lui en parler ?
Je te donne son numťro,
il a un portable.
Ce sera pas nťcessaire.
J'ai tout le respect
du monde pour Bey.
Alors montre-le ŗ sa famille.
Rends-moi fiŤre, entendu ?
Bordel, ta mŤre,
c'est un vrai dragon.
Elle a pas froid aux yeux.
«a m'a permis de comprendre,
en tout cas.
- Comprendre quoi ?
- Pourquoi t'es comme Áa.
Hť, les gars. Vous allez oý ?
J'ai faim. Faut que je mange.
Non, venez. On finit Áa.
C'est chiant, ce truc.
…coutez, les mecs.
Je vous paierai pas
si vous finissez pas...
Tu as dťjŗ l'argent ?
Idiot, si cet enculť t'a dťjŗ payť,
pourquoi on est encore lŗ ?
C'est un boulot.
Il peut s'en prendre qu'ŗ lui-mÍme.
C'est sa faute, s'il t'a payť d'avance.
Tu dois partager l'argent
parce que lŗ,
on perd notre temps.
Vous avez mÍme pas fini
la journťe de travail.
Prends-moi quelque chose,
au moins.
- De la truite.
- Avec un soda ?
- Ouais, ŗ la fraise.
- Je te ramŤne Áa.
Oý sont les autres ?
Randy leur a filť un boulot.
Distribuer des tracts,
je sais pas quoi.
Tu voulais pas le faire ?
Non. C'est des conneries.
- J'ai un boulot aussi.
- Ah oui ?
Ouais, avec Bodie.
J'ai un paquet ŗ moi.
Tu veux te joindre ŗ moi ?
T'es sŻr ?
On pourrait bosser ensemble.
Non, mec. C'est ton truc.
Fais ce que t'as ŗ faire.
Ouais, d'accord.
On se voit plus tard.
Elle est mignonne, hein ?
Tu sais que j'aime les femmes.
T'as pas vu Spider ?
«a fait un mois qu'il est pas
venu au gymnase.
Je laisse des messages,
il rappelle pas.
Je comprends pas.
C'ťtait un de mes meilleurs
poids welter.
Pourquoi il partirait comme Áa ?
Pourquoi tu demandes pas ŗ sa mŤre ?
Bordel, j'ai ťtť enfermť
un bon moment.
Je suis pas un ange.
Non, Áa, c'est sŻr.
Merci beaucoup, tout le monde.
Beau boulot, continuez.
On a presque fini.
T'es le meilleur.
Y'a un paquet de gens qui votent.
Les files sont longues ŗ l'ouest,
c'est mauvais signe pour nous.
Nous sommes ici
dans Baltimore ouest,
- le cúur de son ťlectorat.
- C'est aujourd'hui ?
C'est en direct de Lafayette Square.
Clay Davis vient de dire
que son organisation
faisait du porte ŗ porte
pour le compte de Royce.
Il devait se retourner contre le maire.
On a payť 20 000 $
pour cette merde ?
Il est sŻrement parti voir Royce
pour le soudoyer de 30 de plus.
L'enculť. Clay Davis doit savoir
quelque chose qu'on ignore.
Il en sait juste assez
pour se faire payer deux fois.
On n'aurait jamais dŻ payer
ce voleur d'avance.
«a valait le coup d'essayer.
L'entourage du maire
m'a dit en privť qu'ils sont inquiets...
Je vais m'en chercher une fraÓche.
Contre le mur.
Agent Walker.
Je sors pas comme Áa
avec un flingue.
Tu volerais Áa ŗ un pauvre mec ?
Tu sais pas qu'il y a des rŤgles
dans ce jeu.
Des rŤgles ?
Oý est votre fusil, M. Omar ?
C'est quoi, votre problŤme ?
Vous pouvez pas m'accuser.
On t'accuse de meurtre, fils de pute.
De meurtre ? J'ai tuť qui ?
- McNulty. C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
- ņ toi de me le dire.
On a un mandat pour vol
et meurtre dans un magasin.
Le fourgon est lŗ.
McNulty, je dois tťlťphoner.
Va te faire foutre.
Si vous me coffrez,
je dois passer un appel ce soir.
410-958-6612.
Laissez sonner.
Tiens.
Butchie. J'ai ťtť arrÍtť.
Tu veux quoi ? J'aurai ta caution.
Pas de caution. Ils parlent de meurtre.
De meurtre ?
T'inquiŤte pas, je m'en occupe.
Tu te la joues dťmocrate
ou quoi ?
L'afflux des votants a ťtť important
toute la journťe.
Certains bureaux
avaient des files d'attente
dŤs leur ouverture ŗ 7h00 ce matin.
Les officiels, quant ŗ eux,
ont enregistrť peu de problŤmes.
Maintenant que les bureaux
sont fermťs,
les officiels
du bureau des ťlections
ont commencť le fastidieux
processus de comptage,
en se prťparant ŗ une longue nuit.
AprŤs le dťcompte d'un peu plus
de la moitiť des districts,
M. Thomas J. Carcetti
a une avance de 2 %.
Traditionnellement,
les derniers rťsultats
viennent des districts ouest
de Baltimore,
qui devraient favoriser
le maire Royce.
- Comment Áa s'est passť ?
- Bien. Rien de spťcial.
Je compte sur toi, Nay.
Les sondages au sortir des urnes
dans les districts-clťs montrent
que les prioritťs des ťlecteurs
pour la ville sont partagťes
entre la criminalitť et l'ťducation
par exemple.
...Ce fut une sacrťe ťlection.
Depuis que la course s'est resserrťe
ces derniŤres semaines,
je vous ai dit que cette ťlection
se gagnerait sur le terrain.
Celui avec la meilleure
campagne de terrain l'emportera.
Tout dťpend de l'abstention...
Et Bond ?
Bon. ņ plus.
Bond s'en sort trŤs bien face ŗ Demper.
On pourrait bien avoir
un nouveau procureur.
«a signifie quoi pour toi ?
Demper est le protťgť de Royce.
Tu peux avoir de l'espoir, Tommy.
Tu sais quoi ?
On va sortir un peu d'ici.
Faisons une promenade.
J'aurai ta peau.
- C'est joli.
- Un peu nausťabond.
On peut rien faire
contre l'odeur dans les ports.
Les gens voudront que tu y fasses
quelque chose.
J'imagine.
Tu sembles confiante.
J'ai un pressentiment.
«a pourrait redevenir
une grande ville.
On pourrait attirer
de nouveaux emplois,
faire revenir les gens,
rťparer les habitations.
«a sonne ŗ nouveau.
Terri.
Tu devrais peut-Ítre rťpondre.
J'ai pas besoin d'un rapport
toutes les cinq minutes.
- On devrait y aller.
- On est obligťs ?
Ils doivent Ítre sur les nerfs.
Ils ne savent pas oý tu es.
Je fais une promenade
avec ma femme.
On arrive.
Royce s'avoue vaincu.
Les rťsultats
des districts ouest sont lŗ.
On a obtenu deux votes sur cinq
dans certains.
On lui a volť sa base.
On a gagnť.
Sommes-nous heureux ?
Je crois.
Je crois que oui.
Tu es sŻr ?
Je voulais vous remercier
pour votre travail et votre dťvouement.
Applaudissez-vous. Allez.
Je viens d'avoir le maire Royce
et M. Gray.
Ils ont ťtť trŤs courtois.
Je leur ai demandť leur aide.
On a encore une ťlection
gťnťrale ŗ remporter.
Y a-t-il un candidat rťpublicain
ŗ la mairie de Baltimore ?
Je ne sais pas.
Mais en supposant qu'on gagne,
on a encore beaucoup de travail
pour faire basculer cette ville,
et nous aurons besoin de tous ceux
qui accepteront de nous rejoindre
pour faire de Baltimore
une meilleure ville pour nos enfants.
Je ne ferai de longs
discours, promis.
«a vous ennuierait.
Donc pas de longs discours.
Je vous remercierai individuellement,
mais pour ce soir, faisons la fÍte !
Comment allez-vous ?
Damond.
J'ai h‚te de travailler avec vous,
M. le maire.
De mÍme. Fťlicitations ŗ vous.
- Je rentre.
- Non, reste. «a ne sera pas long.
Bien sŻr que si.
C'est ta soirťe.
Regarde qui a ťchouť sur la plage.
Fťlicitations, M. le maire.
Je vous souhaite bonne chance.
J'ai h‚te de travailler avec vous.
Je devrais pas vous haÔr ?
J'ai ťtť gentil avec toi, mon garÁon.
J'aurais pu te prendre deux fois plus.
Tu t'en es bien sorti.
Il a raison.
Butchie nous envoie.
Pourquoi t'es lŗ ?
Pour un 22-55.
J'ai rťpondu.
- "Nťgro" ?
- "Nťgro".
Il a dit Áa devant toi ?
Il a insistť, en plus.
Tu disais que je devais
consolider ma base.
Tu n'as pas rťagi ?
L'ironie de la dťmocratie.
Un vote est un vote.
Je les prends tous.
En parlant de scrutin,
tu as votť pour moi, Norman ?
Le secret de l'isoloir
est un des piliers
de la dťmocratie amťricaine.
Je dois filer. Je te dťpose ?
Dans mes bras. T'es le meilleur.
- Oui, reposez-vous.
- Promis.
Un jour. Deux jours.
- Sois sage.
- Je t'appellerai.
Je m'en doute bien.
Je devrais y aller aussi.
Un dernier pour la route ?
Un scotch, c'est bon ?
Je dois admettre que c'est agrťable.
Tu le mťrites.
Tu as travaillť dur.
C'est vrai.
ņ la tienne.
Quand j'ai acceptť ce boulot, tu m'as
promis une prime en cas de victoire.
Elle est ŗ toi.
Je peux pas faire Áa.
Pas maintenant.
Allons, Tommy.
Tu n'as pas changť.
D'aprŤs Norman,
t'as failli l‚cher la campagne
pour une blonde
au dÓner des Stonewall
il y a deux mois.
Il a dŻ te traÓner hors du bar.
C'est pas que je veux pas...
C'est ta nouvelle position
de maire, c'est Áa ?
Tu es sur le devant de la scŤne,
dťsormais.
Eh bien, Tommy...
quatre ans, c'est long
pour un gars comme toi.
C'est peut-Ítre ta derniŤre occasion
avant longtemps.
T'es sŻr ?
Peut-Ítre que tu as vraiment
appris quelque chose.
Fais-moi un chŤque, alors.
Ils ont des Cheerios ici ?
Merde.
Yo, recule, connard !
Mon pote m'a gardé ma place, yo.
Dommage qu'on ait pas passé
plus de temps ensemble.
On aurait pu faire
deux-trois mômes ensemble.
Personne a vu que dalle.
- C'est comment comme message ?
- Pas mal.
À part que le prix sur ta tête
n'est pas à quatre chiffres,
- mais à cinq.
- Merde. Pour tant de fric,
j'aurais dû te baiser
moi-même.
C'est pour qui la prime ?
Qui ? Un mec du West Side
qui s'appelle Marlo.
Marlo ? Je peux pas dire
que je le connais.
Il te connaît.
Tu peux m'arranger
un coup de téléphone ?
Je peux faire mieux que ça.
Qui tu appelles ?
- La police.
- La police ?
Le type me doit une faveur.
SUR ÉCOUTE
"Oui. C'est la règle d'or".
...la criminalité, la violence,
la drogue,
la toxicomanie,
l'échec du système scolaire...
tous ces problèmes sociaux
à Baltimore
encore et encore.
Et le 8 juin,
quand j'ai dû écrire un article
pour le lendemain,
des statistiques du FBI
venaient de montrer
une augmentation de certains
crimes à Baltimore.
Il y a aussi eu cinq fusillades
sur une période de deux-trois jours.
Et vous savez,
l'idée de me mettre à nouveau
à écrire un autre article
sur ce sujet...
je ne sais pas
si c'est important.
Mais je suis un habitant
de Baltimore,
et je prends ma ville autant au sérieux
que mon travail de journaliste.
J'ai dit : "Que puis-je en dire ?
Si les fusillades continuent...
DICTIONNAIRE FRANÇAIS
entre 250 et 300 homicides par an...
Le meilleur du monde.
J'ai fait sauter un maire sortant, Tony.
C'est pas facile.
Le parti doit prendre
note de ça.
Jeune et beau, comme vous l'êtes,
je suis sûr qu'ils ont des idées.
Tout ce que vous avez à faire,
c'est de gérer la ville.
Tony, je dois vous demander
quelque chose :
Pourquoi vous ne vous êtes pas
représenté après le premier mandat ?
Personne n'avait votre nom,
votre organisation.
Laissez-moi vous raconter
une histoire, Tommy.
Le jour où je suis devenu maire,
on m'a fait asseoir au bureau...
un grand fauteuil en bois sombre,
beaucoup de belles choses.
J'ai pensé :
"Ça ne peut pas être mieux".
Quelqu'un a frappé
à la porte,
et Pete est entré,
portant cette magnifique coupe
de Sèvres en argent,
ciselée à la main.
Elle était grande comme ça.
"C'est de la part des syndicats",
a-t-il dit.
J'ai pensé que c'était un cadeau,
pour commémorer mon premier jour.
Et il s'est approché,
l'a posée sur un bureau.
J'ai regardé dedans.
C'était dégoûtant.
J'ai dit :
"Mais qu'est-ce que c'est ?"
Il a dit :
"Ça a l'air de quoi ?"
J'ai dit :
"On dirait de la merde.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez
que j'en fasse ?"
Il a dit :
"Mangez-la".
"Manger ça ?"
Il a dit : "Oui.
Vous êtes le maire.
Vous devez la manger".
Bon, d'accord.
C'était mon premier jour
et Pete en savait plus que moi.
Alors, je m'y suis mis.
Et quand j'ai eu fini,
quelqu'un a frappé à la porte.
Et Pete a apporté
une autre coupe en argent,
celle-ci, de la part des Noirs.
"Ça aussi ?"
Il a fait oui de la tête.
J'ai commencé à manger.
Et quand j'ai fini,
quelqu'un a encore frappé
et apporté une autre coupe.
Celle-ci était de la part
des Polonais.
Et après ça,
une autre de la part des pasteurs.
Et vous savez quoi, Tommy ?
C'est exactement ça.
On bouffe de la merde toute la journée,
jour après jour,
année après année.
Quand j'ai compris ça,
j'ai décidé qu'être avocat
au centre ville
et voir ma famille tous les soirs,
c'était la belle vie.
Vraiment la belle vie.
Cheval brun, juste là, mec.
Compris, cheval brun.
Tout le monde sait que ce négro
va pas cafter, non ?
Spider, Spider, attends.
Allez, mec.
Pourquoi tu passes plus
à ma salle ?
Je t'attends depuis des semaines.
Parle-moi, fiston.
Tu n'es pas mon père, putain !
Ce qui s'est passé
entre ta mère et moi
n'a aucun rapport avec le fait
que tu profites de la salle de boxe.
Je dis seulement
que tu es un des meilleurs.
Putain, si j'avais pensé que j'allais
te faire mal, je n'aurais pas...
Va te faire foutre !
Personne ne me fera mal.
Va te faire foutre.
Dégage, vieux.
J'ai des clients qui attendent.
Cheval brun, cheval brun.
Cinq et encore cinq.
Merde.
Voilà ce que ça fait.
Yo, la dernière carte posée.
Oh oui.
Ma faute.
Hé, les gars.
Vous savez que ça ne me dérange pas
que vous veniez
déjeuner ici la plupart du temps,
mais vous ne pouvez pas parier.
Yo, M. Prezbo, les 25 centimes,
c'est juste
pour me rappeler
que j'ai 25 coquilles.
C'est tout. Allez,
voyons ce que tu as.
Mince !
Un flush.
- Mais ça ne bat pas tes trois 9.
- Si, ça le fasse.
- Ça le fasse ?
- Ça le fasse.
Ça le fait.
Karim, t'aurais dû être plus prudent
en pariant. Pense aux probabilités.
Yo, c'est la pause déjeuner.
Ne nous enseignez rien maintenant.
Attends.
Laisse-le parler.
Pour commencer, tu dois faire
le compte des carreaux.
- Combien il y en a dans un jeu ?
- 13.
13... c'est juste. Pour jouer
aux cartes, il faut savoir compter.
Avec les chiffres, on peut
calculer les probabilités.
Michael avait quatre carreaux.
Un instant. Attendez.
Et les dés ?
Pour les dés,
il y a aussi des probabilités ?
Parce que c'est surtout
à ça qu'on joue.
Les dés ?
Oui. Bien sûr.
Alors, vous pouvez nous montrer
les probabilités aux dés ?
- Oui, M'sieur.
- Oui, M'sieur, apprenez-nous les dés.
- Ça va être dur.
- Vraiment.
Voici la prison, Rick.
L'affaire Braddock ?
On a la permission
de résoudre cette putain d'affaire
puisque tout le monde
a fini de voter.
Résolvez-la, courageux centurions !
Tu n'as pas de travail à faire ?
Pas avant que j'aie
de nouvel appel, non.
Combien tu peux vendre ça ?
Excellent état, 300.
Putain !
Il me faut un passe-temps.
C'est ça,
mais il s'est rebuté.
Je pensais qu'il était peut-être
revenu une ou deux fois.
Sherrod est sur la liste
des absents.
Il n'est pas revenu
depuis que vous l'avez amené.
Eh bien, s'il revient,
pouvez-vous lui dire
que je l'attends à la maison
et qu'il peut rentrer
à la maison s'il veut ?
Excusez-moi
de vous avoir retenue.
Je vois que vous êtes là
en civil.
Bien. Ne vous faites pas de souci, mec.
Je la fermerai.
Mme Donnelly ?
Est-ce que l'école
a une collection de jeux
de société...
Parcheesi, Trouble,
Monopoly ?
Vous enseignez toujours les maths
en 3ème, n'est-ce pas ?
J'essaie. Oui.
La bibliothèque en bas.
Respectez le programme,
M. Pryzbylewski,
sinon nous aurons l'inspecteur
du district sur le dos.
Vous vous souvenez de ça ?
Pas dans mon affaire.
Les gars qui travaillent sur l'affaire
ne sont pas d'humeur à écouter.
Comme vous voyez, j'ai encore
la note de l'avocate
et si je me rappelle, un revolver
de la police a servi.
Je suis là uniquement
à cause de ce revolver.
Quant à Ilene Nathan,
elle a promis une libération
pour un petit délit ou deux.
Ceci, c'est le meurtre d'un contribuable
devant témoin oculaire.
Le témoin oculaire ment, yo.
Voyons.
Depuis quand je braque quelqu'un
qui n'est pas dans le gang ?
Oh ! Omar.
Le vieux André ment.
Le propriétaire du magasin...
pourquoi mentirait-il ?
- André ramasse un paquet du magasin.
- Ah.
Des gens comme ça
ont tendance à avoir des ressentiments
envers les gens comme moi.
Si vous n'avez pas fait ça,
alors que vous avez fait d'autres...
merde, j'ai des dossiers
sur deux doubles meurtres l'an dernier.
Des douilles de balles
aux deux endroits.
Et la fusillade à cette planque ?
Et Stringer Bell
et le corps dans l'entrepôt ?
Si vous n'avez pas fait celui-ci,
vous avez dû en faire une douzaine.
Et si celui-ci passe au tribunal,
vous pourrez dire aux jurés
que c'est faux.
Évidemment, on est seul
quand on prête serment.
Si vous me laissez tomber
au tribunal, je suis foutu.
- Vous le savez.
- Oui.
Alors, vous ne
vous faites pas d'amis ?
On a mis une prime
sur ma tête,
cinq chiffres.
Si j'avais su que je me retrouverais
avec tous ces gars,
je n'en aurais probablement pas
volés autant.
Oui, c'est la règle d'or.
Puisque que
vous vous sentez si juste,
honnête et tout,
pensez à ça :
si Omar n'a pas tué
la livreuse, un autre gars l'a fait.
Mais vous le laissez en liberté,
n'est-ce pas ?
Un homme doit avoir
son honneur.
C'est quoi ?
Juste les dés.
Prends les dés
de tous les jeux qui en ont.
On utilise la 3ème édition,
c'est ça ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- On utilise la 3ème.
Qu'est-ce que la nouvelle 5ème édition
fait là dans une boîte ?
Incroyable !
Grand rouge, tout le monde.
Grands rouges par là.
Quoi de neuf, mec ?
J'ai ton grand jaune.
Quoi de neuf ?
Du grand jaune pour toi.
Regarde-toi,
à faire des affaires.
Grand oiseau jaune.
Yo, avec qui t'es pote ?
J'ai pas de pote.
Ils ont leur coin.
J'ai le mien.
J'ai rien.
Tu vas à la boxe aujourd'hui ?
Je te verrai peut-être
tout à l'heure.
Grand jaune.
Grands oiseaux jaunes par ici.
- Ils sont peut-être avec Marlo.
- Ils sont avec personne.
Ce sont juste des jeunes
qui jouent dans cette merde.
Alors, qu'est-ce que tu veux faire ?
Je veux pas traîner là et attirer la police
dans notre boutique.
Quand ils dégageront,
tu les suivras.
- Tabasse-les bien.
- Et s'ils filent ?
Jaune, grand jaune.
C'est pas la peine
de flinguer quelqu'un,
mais ils ont besoin d'un avertissement.
Qu'ils sachent qu'on plaisante pas.
Tout frais venu de la rue.
J'ai essayé de faire sortir
celui qui était après moi.
Je l'ai emmené à la gare.
Ça a marché ?
La police des trains
m'est tombée dessus.
Je ne pouvais pas le flinguer.
Il te faut un nom.
Trouve et
je me renseigne pour toi.
Je vais chercher.
La caméra est encore là ?
Vole cette saloperie.
Personne ne lui parle
et puis la police fédérale
te suspecte.
Y'a que la police fédérale qui peut
se permettre de perdre une caméra
et ne pas pleurer.
Si tu voles cette saloperie
et qu'on envoie quelqu'un chez toi,
c'est que c'est un problème local.
Vole cette saloperie.
Vois ce qui arrive.
Tu connais le garçon qui poussait
ces chariots avec moi,
il s'appelle Sherrod.
Je le cherche.
J'ai de bonnes nouvelles.
Si tu le trouves,
dis-lui de venir me voir.
Ça fait 9 $ pour deux,
10 $ pour trois.
Ça c'est 10 $ tout juste.
C'est un bon produit.
C'est pas de la camelote.
Les gens passent devant la caméra...
et font des signes.
C'est fait en Chine, ce truc.
- Ouais.
- Non ?
Hé, bro.
Merci beaucoup.
C'est une bonne affaire,
une bonne affaire.
Rappelle-toi d'interpeller
mon fiston, si tu le vois.
D'accord.
D'accord, on y va !
Magasin de Bubble
pour mes frères.
Bubble règle vos soucis.
J'ai pas encore de soucis.
D'accord.
D'accord.
Doucement, d'accord ?
Je sais que tu te souviens de moi.
D'accord, sois cool.
Aboule, négro...
c'est ce que je vais te dire
à chaque fois qu'on se verra.
Du fric ou des pilules,
je m'en fiche.
D'accord, d'accord. Cool.
Je le prends.
Tu vois ?
Recule, yo.
Il est dans un trou.
Salopard, c'est mauvais
pour les affaires, mec.
Vous vous fichez tous
du magasin de votre quartier ?
Quoi de neuf ?
Monsieur l'agent.
Comment ça va, monsieur l'agent ?
Vous pouvez m'aider ?
Je viens de me faire voler.
Merci.
Ils l'ont tous vu.
Tout le monde était témoin de tout.
Il vous a pris votre argent ?
Oui. Le même gars
tous les jours.
Il a pris l'allée
vers Payson Street.
Vous pouvez le rattraper
sur Lafayette...
Vous ne pouvez pas vendre
dans la rue sans permis.
Et ces films... c'est du piratage.
- Voyons...
- L'amende est lourde.
C'est mes...
Vous allez me voler aussi ?
C'est ce que vous allez faire ?
Me voler aussi ?
Voici le meilleur de Baltimore.
Merci.
Rassemblez-vous tous,
d'accord ?
Tout le monde fait une pause
et on se rassemble.
Mike, viens ici aussi.
Je veux que tous ceux qui utilisent
cette salle entendent ça.
La plupart d'entre vous
savent que je suis revenu
après un long moment en taule.
Et certains d'entre vous...
tout le monde m'a sûrement vu
prendre plaisir aux attentions
de certaines des dames
qui sont passées.
Du calme.
Je réalise que certaines de ces dames
sont vos amies.
Je n'ai pas voulu vous manquer
de respect
ou vous froisser.
Vous venez tous ici
pour apprendre un sport
et progresser.
Je ne devrais pas
empêcher ça.
Bon.
Et si ton témoin joue le jeu
et que Omar l'a bien branché...
- C'est quoi ça, merde ?
- Je ne fais que demander, Crutch.
Il est de ta famille ou quoi ?
Hé, Vernon, tu as fait
une recherche sur Old Face, c'est ça ?
Oui. C'était un connard.
Et alors ?
Et alors ?
C'est quoi l'histoire ?
On vient parler de tes enquêtes
en disant ce genre de conneries ?
- Oh.
- On fait ça ?
- Voyons...
- Non, va te faire foutre, Bunk.
- Va te faire foutre.
- Va te faire foutre.
Dès qu'il sortira de la salle de boxe,
tu lui botteras le cul, mec.
Fiche bien la trouille
à ce négro.
Tu pensais que je ne le ferais pas.
Certains ont besoin
d'être réprimandés.
Je ne sais pas si ça vaut
le coup, tout ça, mec.
Quoi, tu as peur, négro ?
Il faut qu'on te fasse bouger le cul
un peu plus.
On y va.
Tu reviens par là demain ?
Je pense que tu devrais
éviter ce coin.
Je te parle, salope !
Va te faire foutre !
Va te faire foutre !
Faut pas cafter, négro.
Allez régler ça ailleurs
que devant chez moi.
Namond, rentre.
Va te faire foutre, mec !
Ouais, ouais, ouais.
Hé, je te comprends, mec.
Mais pas de bagarre ici,
d'accord ?
Va à l'intérieur, mec.
Yo, qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
Qu'est-ce qui t'est arrivé ?
C'est rien.
Tu devrais voir comment
est l'autre négro.
- Qui c'était ?
- C'est rien.
Je peux m'occuper de cet imbécile.
- T'as pas besoin de t'en mêler.
- Bien sûr que non !
Tu avais les choses en mains.
Regarde ta figure !
Bien sûr, je reconnais que l'autre gars
était sacrément grand.
Et tout peut arriver
quand c'est comme ça, tu sais.
Ouais, et il aurait été sur le cul,
si tu ne t'en étais pas mêlé.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Il est mêlé à quelque chose ?
Ça ne me regarde pas.
Et toi non plus.
Sérieusement, vous faites
une sacrée campagne, les gars...
vous n'abandonnez pas,
vous y mettez du cœur.
- Je suis d'accord.
- Ouais. J'ai aimé
quand vous avez avancé
l'histoire du témoin pendant le débat.
Et les putains de prospectus
au dernier moment
et le proprio du taudis et moi dansant
le tango sur les marches du tribunal ?
Attendez.
Parker, qui est derrière ça ?
Je n'ai pas vu
d'ordre de Royce.
Eh bien ?
Tommy, ça suffit les conneries, hm ?
Qu'est-ce que vous attendez donc ?
Amenez vos fesses
et essayez le grand fauteuil.
Allez.
Venez là.
Je ne suis même pas encore élu.
Les élections ne sont
que dans quelques semaines.
Si vous ne battez pas Crawford
dans une ville où nous battons
les Républicains neuf contre un,
vous ne méritez pas ce boulot.
Allez, venez là.
Si je perds les élections,
je dirai que c'est la faute
de Norman.
Il prends la suite
de Terri D'Agostino.
Elle a bien travaillé
pour vous.
Oui.
Le parti a remarqué.
Elle est de nouveau au Comité
électoral démocrate.
J'espère qu'elle a eu un bonus
quand elle s'est retirée.
Oh, oui.
Ils lui ont donné ma part aussi.
Vous ne le savez donc pas ?
Tommy, tout ce qu'il vous faudra
pour avancer
pour les élections,
pour la transition...
Je veux foncer, alors il va falloir
que je connaisse les organisations,
les budgets, les problèmes... tout.
Où que vous vouliez aller,
quoi que vous vouliez regarder,
- occupez-vous en.
- Mm-hm.
C'est un sacré boulot.
Je suis à moitié content
d'en sortir.
Ça va me manquer.
L'affaire Braddock te fait
tourner en rond ?
J'ai perdu mon temps
toute la journée.
Pourquoi ne pas parler
à Wardell lui-même ?
Demande-lui s'il a tué
le témoin contre lui.
S'il a lu les journaux, il sait déjà
qu'il est suspect.
Il passera au détecteur de mensonge ?
Appelle son avocat.
Dis-lui qu'ils vont passer l'affaire
de drogue au tribunal fédéral
parce qu'un témoin
a été assassiné.
Dis-lui que si son client
ne coopère pas,
il aura des peines obligatoires
minimales sans sursis.
Les fédéraux ne veulent plus
d'affaires de drogue,
surtout pas une affaire qui s'écroulera
sans témoin-clé.
Bluffe !
Qu'est-ce que tu as à perdre ?
Peut-être qu'il craquera.
Peut-être que non.
Mais de toute façon,
il parlera un peu
et toi, l'inspecteur,
tu pourras l'écouter.
Mais qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Des oiseaux, je crois.
Tu vois ça, là ?
On dirait une aile qui bat.
Merde. Putain !
J'en ai rien à foutre
de toute façon !
M. Bond ?
Hé. Appelez-moi Rupert.
Merci d'être venue.
J'essaie de démarrer
en rencontrant
mes chefs d'unités.
Pas de problème.
Félicitations pour les résultats
de l'élection.
Vous arriverez
avec un sacré mandat.
C'est possible.
Comment puis-je vous aider
pour cette transition ?
Il n'y a pas beaucoup d'affaires
de drogue de haut niveau en cours
- et les crimes majeurs...
- On en fera abstraction.
Quand les sondages m'ont mis
là-haut avec Demper,
les gens ont commencé
à me parler à l'oreille.
Et j'ai aussi entendu parler
de vos assignations...
Andy Krawczyk,
Clay Davis.
Monsieur, je ne voulais pas...
Poursuivre deux ou trois financiers
de Royce quatre semaines
avant les primaires ?
Oui. Vous perdez votre temps
dans les affaires de drogue.
Laissez-moi deviner...
- Et l'U.C.V. comme chef d'unité ?
- Quoi ?
L'Unité des Crimes Violents.
Et si vous preniez ça
en mains pour moi ?
Carcetti a fait campagne
sur la réduction des meurtres,
alors l'U.C.V. sera en première ligne,
n'est-ce pas ?
Vous me donnez la responsabilité
des poursuites pour homicide ?
Et Ilene Nathan ?
Elle est promue adjointe.
Je suis venue prête à être rétrogradée
aux délits mineurs ou pire.
Pourquoi penseriez-vous ça ?
Les assignations
et le fait que Demper...
Demper a perdu les élections.
J'ai gagné.
J'admire votre courage,
si ce n'est votre loyauté.
Lester.
Excusez-moi ?
Pardonnez-moi.
L'U.C.V., c'est super.
Je suis plus que prête à travailler
sur les meurtres pour vous.
Bien.
Appelez-moi Rupert.
Mais maintenant
elle a dit à la police
qu'elle a accepté de coucher avec Paul
et Monnel seulement. Alors...
- Alors, Randy...
- Il sera de retour demain.
- Et le truc avec la police ?
- Ça ne dépend pas de moi.
Moins de bruit, les filles !
Quanice, jette ton chewing-gum.
Bon, calmez-vous.
M. Prezbo !
Qu'est-ce qu'il fait
avec un ordinateur ?
Nous aurons un ordinateur en classe
pour des projets spéciaux...
et autre chose...
Mince!
Ils sont neufs !
Laissez les vieux
sur vos bureaux
et mettez vos noms
dans la case
sur la couverture
des nouveaux.
D'accord. Quelqu'un a-t-il eu
des problèmes avec les devoirs ?
- Charlene ?
- Je n'ai pas compris.
- Pas compris quoi ?
- Tout.
Michael ?
C'est super.
Bon travail.
Et alors ?
Calvin, c'est ton travail ?
On dirait que c'est celui
de quelqu'un d'autre.
Non, j'ai fait mon travail.
D'accord. La prochaine fois
essaie de te souvenir
de ne pas copier le nom
de Quanice en haut.
Bon. Tout le monde
a reçu un nouveau manuel ?
Oui !
Super. Bon.
Pour le moment du moins,
vous pouvez les ranger.
- Ouah !
- Super !
Namond, pourquoi tu n'es pas
en uniforme ?
Pourquoi as-tu décidé
de ne pas le porter ?
Je ne suis pas dans ma classe,
alors je n'en ai pas besoin.
Intéressant.
Pourquoi vous notez toujours
tout ce qu'on dit ?
Vous voulez entrer dans notre tête ?
Tu veux entrer dans la mienne ?
Chandra, tu te crois
au salon de beauté ou en classe ?
Darnell, pourquoi tu n'as pas mis
ton uniforme ?
Je voulais. Vraiment.
Oui, mais après une bouteille de vodka,
ce serait difficile de savoir
quelle chemise
on est censé porter.
Et tu trouves ça drôle, Namond ?
Va te faire foutre.
Darnell est alcoolique
et Namond, nous pensons
qu'il a des problèmes
de comportement.
- Tu veux te faire expulser ?
- Va te faire foutre.
Oui, il le critique toujours.
Chandra, il faut vraiment
que tu te coiffes en classe ?
Allez vous faire foutre, connasse !
- Je devrais te dire...
- Vous ne direz rien à personne !
Oui. Je me demandais
pourquoi elle était dans la classe.
Elle semblait si...
Chandra, écoute-moi.
Personnalité rebelle.
Ne me parlez pas, connasse !
Je suis désolée
que tu aies une mauvaise journée
mais tu devras sortir un moment
avec Mlle Mason.
Reviens quand tu te seras calmée.
Merde. Au revoir,
ma chérie, Chandra.
Oui, tu crois ?
Je répète que c'est un test
au détecteur de mensonges,
qui n'est pas recevable
et les réponses à toutes les questions
sont considérées
comme des suggestions
- conférant une immunité limitée.
- D'accord.
Pour commencer, répondez oui
à une série de questions,
que cette réponse
soit juste ou non.
Vous appelez-vous Anthony Wardell ?
Oui.
Êtes-vous de Baltimore,
dans le Maryland ?
Maintenant, je suis à la Prison
Municipale mais je suis du East Side.
Alors, votre réponse est oui ?
Oui, je suis de Baltimore.
Vous êtes une femme ?
Ça va pas... pardon.
Oui, je suis une salope.
- Hé, ma douce.
- Chandra.
Nous travaillons
les rédactions courtes.
Si tu...
Les diamants sont les meilleurs
amis des filles.
Il faut se baisser
pour se coucher.
Namond, si tu n'arrêtes pas,
je vais devoir te demander
de quitter la classe.
À dans trois jours, pauvres cons...
Tu quittes la classe,
pas l'école.
Quoi ?
Et maintenant, connasse ? Hein ?
Hein ?
Ce n'est pas nécessaire, Namond.
Oh, vous allez me renvoyer ?
On va avoir une petite conversation.
Allez vous faire foutre.
Je connais les règles.
Vous devez me renvoyer.
L'école doit avoir des règles.
Il a raison.
Il faut des règles.
Le fait est que je peux tirer
les conclusions que vous voulez.
Vous voulez qu'il ait réussi ?
Il a réussi.
Vous voulez que les résultats
soient incertains ? Alors ils le sont.
C'est quoi ce genre
de science ?
Voyons. Le résultat
est positif ou non ?
Je suis à votre service,
inspecteur.
Vous savez pourquoi
on utilise le détecteur de mensonge ?
Pour influencer les gens.
Pour le faire venir ici
et lui mettre la pression.
Pas étonnant que cette merde
soit inadmissible.
Laissez-moi deviner.
Ils sont dans le couloir
et Swatowski leur dit
qu'il peut interpréter ça
comme ils veulent.
Si vous pensez ça, pourquoi
laisser votre client...
Parce que l'affaire
ne tient plus à grand-chose,
maintenant que votre témoin
est mort.
Je n'ai pas besoin de l'exposer
à une accusation fédérale.
Et parce que même si Swatowski
nous avantage,
il vous a dit que M. Wardell
n'a pas échoué.
Yo, je ne tuerais pas.
Même si ça m'emmerde,
je ne toucherai pas ce gars.
Pourquoi pas ?
Sa mère et la mienne...
sont comme des cousines.
Elles sont venues ensemble
à Latrobe, vous savez.
Je le connais
depuis la maternelle.
Mais il allait témoigner.
Je prendrais combien
pour une première inculpation ?
Sept, huit ans ?
Je sortirai dans trois ans et demi.
Vous croyez que je tuerais le fils
de la cousine de ma mère pour ça ?
Je sais que ça l'a aidé
à se faire élire
de dire que j'ai fait ça,
mais, s'il vous plaît...
Le salopard allait témoigner
contre moi
mais je jure devant Dieu
que je regrette qu'il soit mort.
Vraiment.
Hé, Ilene, je vous cherchais partout.
Omar Little.
Du procès de Bird,
il y a deux-trois ans.
- Le gars du cambriolage.
- Mm-hm.
Il est à la prison municipale
pour meurtre.
Cambriolage de magasin
dans le West Side.
Quand je lui ai donné la carte, j'ai dit
pour délit mineur, au mieux.
Oui, bien sûr, mais il doit
être transféré
et placé en détention
préventive autre part.
Il partage la même adresse
avec 800 autres gars
qui ont vu le bout
de son revolver.
- Et pourquoi ça vous touche ?
- C'est un coup monté contre lui.
Vraiment ? Quel rapport
avec le reste des gars en prison ?
Tout ce que je demande,
c'est que vous le transfériez
dans un centre de détention régional
au moins jusqu'à ce que j'aie le temps
de travailler sur ça.
Cette carte devrait lui faire
obtenir ça.
Le Centre de Détention du Comté
de Hartford est assez calme ?
- Oui.
- Allez chercher l'ordre de transfert
dans mon bureau et dites à M. Little
que j'ai remboursé ma dette.
Les meurtres ont diminué de 14%
dans le West Side.
Mais je ne vais pas m'en vanter
alors que tous les autres crimes
augmentent.
- Pourquoi pas, Commandant ?
- Un grand homme m'a dit,
alors que je n'étais pas
encore sergent,
qu'on ne doit pas se vanter
d'une diminution de la criminalité
si on ne veut pas
qu'on vous reproche sa recrudescence.
Garde à vous !
Le futur maire est à bord.
S'il vous plait, retournez
à ce que vous faisiez.
Je ne suis qu'un conseiller
municipal qui observe.
Repos, Messieurs.
Commandant Daniels, continuez
votre présentation.
De toute façon, plutôt que de laisser
mes voitures patrouiller,
j'ai posté des voitures
avec deux hommes
dans les pires coins
de vente de drogue :
Edmonson Avenue, Poplar Grove,
Fayette Street, Baltimore Street,
North Avenue.
Une voiture avec deux hommes
est plus agressive
et ça permet de pousser la drogue
hors des coins les plus sensibles,
- ce qui pourrait faire son effet.
- La pousser seulement ?
Je ne consacre pas
mes ressources
à de simples arrestations.
J'essaie plutôt d'inciter
chaque agent
à s'attaquer
aux délits majeurs.
Je pourrais faire plus,
mais à mon avis,
mes hommes ne sont pas
suffisamment entraînés
pour enquêter sur de telles affaires.
Commandant, vous venez
d'insulter vos hommes.
Un trop grand nombre
de mes hommes a passé des années
à faire des arrestations, ramasser
des corps et faire des statistiques.
Mais cela ne vous apprend pas
à bien rédiger un mandat d'arrêt
ou émettre une opinion
quant à la cause probable,
l'utilisation ou le fait
de ne pas être utilisé par un indicateur.
Je souhaiterais que les choses
soient différentes.
Mais si je suis après
des délits graves,
je ne peux y consacrer
que très peu de mes hommes.
- Tu l'as déjà !
- C'est ça.
Faire travailler les négros,
c'est ce que tu aimes,
pas vrai, connard ?
Tu ne peux pas te cacher, fiston.
Nulle part.
Je te trouverai toujours,
même dans le cul d'un négro.
Putain, il lui en a fait voir.
- Ouais.
- Bon, alors...
On commence un peu plus tard
que je voulais.
Mais tu as dit que tu allais
filer de l'école après manger.
J'ai essayé.
Ils ne voulaient pas me mettre dehors.
Merde. Aucune école ne me retient
quand je veux sortir.
Ils m'ont mis dans une nouvelle classe.
C'est nul, ils font tout
à l'envers et tout.
Bon, alors, voyons :
Bobby, tu t'occupes
du stock.
Yo yo, pourquoi on n'est pas
où on était hier ?
- C'était un bon coin.
- C'est bien ici ?
Tu déconnes ou quoi ?
Il était là hier.
Ça vaut rien.
Yo, si tu veux pas vendre ma merde,
va te faire foutre, Kenard.
Je garde mon fric.
Ce coin est aussi bien
que l'autre.
Merde...
Carv, tu sais combien coûte
cette caméra vidéo ?
4200 $, ce qui fait de notre aventure
avec ce crétin
une partie de plaisir.
Pour obtenir la caméra,
j'ai dû avoir l'autorisation
de ton chef, n'est-ce pas ?
Et tu l'as perdue pendant le service.
Ton lieutenant comprendra.
Marimow ?
Tu sais ce que ce connard comprend ?
Il te bouffe la vie
pour des petits trucs comme ça.
- Aide-moi, Carv.
- C'est pas mon problème.
Me mets pas dans la merde, Carv.
Pas maintenant.
Tu sais ce que tu fais ?
Tu veux te servir de mon pouvoir.
Alors donne-moi ton pouvoir.
Donne-moi le pouvoir
de retrouver ma putain de caméra.
Tu vois des indics ?
Hier soir, on en a vus.
Sydnor et moi, on a parcouru
le Westside
et regardé dans toutes
les planques d'indics.
Ce matin, rien au radar.
- Tu as fouillé les monts-de-piété ?
- Tous.
Je sais que ce connard de Marlo
a ma caméra.
- Ah, que je suis con !
- Quoi ?
Tu viens de me le rappeler.
Je devais interroger
un gosse qui disait qu'il savait
quelque chose sur un meurtre
que la bande de Marlo a commis.
- Je voulais en parler à Bunk.
- Il a eu l'affaire ?
Non. En fait, il avait un mandat
contre le gars qui aurait été tué.
J'ai patrouillé avec lui
pour ça il y a quelque temps.
Et moi alors ?
J'ai des problèmes, mec.
La seule chose
que tu puisses faire,
c'est d'obtenir des infos
sur Marlo Stanfield ou sa bande.
Fais-lui assez peur
pour qu'il renvoie la caméra.
Qu'est-ce que tu as
sur Marlo ?
Je sais que c'est un dealer.
Je ne peux pas le prouver,
mais je le sais.
Inspecteur Pitts,
ligne 2594. Pitts...
Bon, écoute.
Et si te laissais interroger
le gamin d'abord ?
- Vois ce qu'il peut te dire.
- Ça fera revenir la caméra ?
Peut-être que non,
mais parle au môme
et peut-être qu'il balancera
quelque chose sur Marlo.
Peut-être même un ou deux meurtres.
Avant d'en parler aux Homicides,
rapporte ça à Marimow
comme le chat avec la souris
entre les dents.
Tu lui rapportes le meurtre
et il oubliera probablement la caméra.
Lumen, ligne 5.
Lumen, décroche ce putain
de téléphone.
Je cherche l'inspecteur Moreland.
Pourriez-vous lui dire d'appeler le Sergent
Carver à la Western, s'il vous plaît ?
Carver ? Western ?
Hmm.
D'accord.
Va te faire foutre, Bunk.
- Des idées pour votre cabinet ?
- Beaucoup.
Mais avant tout,
Ervin Burrell a foutu le camp.
J'avais dit à Royce de le virer
il y a plus d'un an,
mais Clarence ne voulait pas énerver
les pasteurs avant les primaires.
Les primaires sont passées.
Il peut le faire maintenant.
Vous pensez que Clarence Royce
vous fera cette faveur ?
Il pense déjà à battre Elijah
et à se présenter pour le siège
au Congrès du 7ème District.
Il aura besoin du soutien
de tous les pasteurs noirs.
- Bon. Je le ferai moi-même.
- Non.
Royce peut renvoyer
un chef de la police noir
mais le futur maire blanc
ne peut pas.
Les Noirs qui ont voté pour vous
vous prendraient à la gorge.
Et si je remplaçais ce salaud
par un chef de police noir ?
En dessous de Burrell, le seul adjoint
noir, c'est Cawthorne et il a 70 ans.
Ensuite, il n'y a que des commandants
et des lieutenants.
On cherchera ailleurs...
une recherche nationale.
Les chefs adjoints
à New York et LA
gagnent plus
que leur chef.
Si vous êtes talentueux et noir,
pourquoi seriez-vous à Baltimore ?
Je me suis souvent posé
cette même question
à nombre d'occasions.
Alors, je suis coincé avec Burrell.
Merde !
Assieds-toi.
Ne le gardez pas tard.
Il doit aller à l'école demain matin.
Je croyais que vous aviez dit
qu'il avaient été renvoyé.
Ils me laissent revenir demain.
Mlle Hannah veut que je sois
à la maison à 9h00.
N'oubliez pas de l'envoyer
à Bunk quand vous aurez fini.
Prenez soin de lui.
C'est un bon gosse.
Tu as faim ?
Oui.
Allons manger.
Hé, petit, laisse-moi
te demander tout de suite :
tu sais à quoi ressemble une caméra
de surveillance de la police ?
Monsieur, vous ne voulez pas
monter avec le Lieutenant Grace ?
C'est elle qui mènera la barque.
À quoi bon monter en voiture
avec les patrons ?
J'ai besoin de voir
ce que la troupe voit.
Bon. J'aime bien l'idée
d'avoir un maire
qui sait à quoi
on est confrontés.
Agents McFarley
et Ginter,
voici le futur maire
et il va patrouiller
avec vous dans le secteur 3.
- Enchanté.
- Bonjour.
Ne le laissez pas se faire capturer.
Évidemment, je ne savais rien
de ça au début.
Le petit Kevin...
il m'a juste dit de dire à Lex
d'aller au terrain de jeu
derrière Fulton
parce que sa copine
était là-bas.
- Et Lex a été tué ?
- Oui.
Où est-ce qu'il a été tué ?
Alors, tu n'as pas vu
quand il a été tué ?
Je vous l'ai dit.
Le petit Kevin...
il m'a dit de dire à Lex d'aller
au terrain de jeu
voir sa copine, Patrice.
Et après, Kevin est venu me dire
que Chris et Snoop
l'avaient tué.
- Quel est le nom de famille de Kevin ?
- Je ne sais pas.
- Tu ne sais pas son nom ?
- Petit Kevin, c'est tout.
Alors, pour clarifier les choses :
tu as dit au gars
d'aller quelque part
et tu as entendu
qu'il a été tué,
mais tu ne sais pas où
il a été tué
et tu ne sais même pas
si on a trouvé le corps ?
- Comment tu sais que Lex est mort ?
- Tout le monde le sait.
- C'est qui, tout le monde ?
- Tout le monde dans le secteur.
Yo, écoutez.
Les gens disaient que Chris
et Snoop faisaient des zombies
avec les négros pour Marlo,
mais ce n'est pas vrai.
Quand on est mort,
on est mort, c'est tout.
Des zombies, hein ?
Tu sais ce que c'est, tout ça ?
Des conneries.
- Tu me racontes des conneries.
- Non, monsieur.
Tu y étais quand Lex
s'est fait descendre, non ?
- Non.
- Si, tu y étais.
Tu es un témoin oculaire qui peut
me faire avoir Snoop et Chris.
- Je vous ai dit...
- Écoute, petit.
Si tu y étais, tu peux le dire.
On peut faire beaucoup pour toi,
peut-être t'aider
avec ton problème à l'école.
Je n'ai plus de problème.
Je suis réglo.
- Tu y étais, n'est-ce pas ?
- Herc.
Dis donc que tu y étais !
Ça vous plaît d'être maire,
jusque là ?
Je dois encore gagner
l'élection générale
et l'investiture n'est pas
avant décembre.
Qu'est-ce que j'en sais ?
Vous ne pouvez pas être pire
que Royce.
La ville tombe en couille.
Eh bien, que suggérez-vous
que je fasse d'abord ?
Une attaque aérienne.
Au phosphore.
Larguez cette merde sur tout ce qui
se trouve entre ici et North Avenue.
Sérieusement.
Ça marche, cette merde.
Mon frère est Marine.
Ils ont utilisé ça
là-bas à Fallujah.
Alerte, coups de feu.
200 North Calhoun.
Bang. Voilà.
Vous allez en voir de la merde,
M. Le Maire. Excusez mon langage.
Tu sais ce qui est nul ?
Personne n'entend le coup de feu.
Sur le rapport, personne n'a même dit
avoir entendu le coup de feu.
Alors, écoute,
ce qu'on doit faire
c'est de reprendre la liste
des visiteurs de Wardell.
Si le sergent me demande,
je suis dans la rue.
Merde, c'est une alerte
sur Calhoun Street ?
Je ne sais pas, mais ils ont signalé
un homme armé il y a 10 minutes.
Vous ne me ramenez pas
chez moi, non ?
Vous pouvez me laisser
à une ou deux rues de là.
Je pourrais marcher
le reste du chemin.
Tu ne veux pas être vu
avec la police, hein ?
Ouais.
D'accord, patron.
Je vais m'arrêter juste là.
À quoi pensait Carv, putain ?
Ce gamin ne peut pas
me balancer un meurtre.
On va s'en prendre
directement à Marlo.
Pourquoi passer par derrière
quand on peut passer par devant ?
Je veux un inspecteur
sur University
au cas où le gars qui sort
ferait une déclaration.
Et ayez quelqu'un
dans la pièce avec lui.
Un sergent vous amène
l'Officier Leach.
L'Inspecteur Hollister a l'arme
et la porte au service balistique.
Non. On dirait un coup direct.
J'ai des douilles
de deux armes suspectes,
de différents calibres,
toutes deux récupérées.
C'est ça.
Oui, je sais.
Non, je ne suis pas ici
sur le lieu du meurtre.
Appelez le porte-parole et faites-lui faire
une déclaration depuis le centre ville.
Dites au Bureau du Procureur
que s'ils veulent envoyer quelqu'un
examiner les lieux, ils doivent le faire
maintenant parce que le Labo
est en train de terminer
et le camion du médecin légiste attend.
Ce n'est pas le commandant
du Secteur Ouest ?
Oui, c'est Daniels.
C'est l'agent de permanence ce soir.
Il a l'air de connaître
son boulot.
Il n'est pas aussi mauvais
que certains.
Police.
Police de Baltimore.
Bon. Il y en reste
85 pour septembre
qui doivent encore faire
une journée en octobre.
Ça ira.
Je compte sur vous, messieurs,
pour que ce soit fait avant la fin du mois.
Je peux vous garder
comme salariés jusque là.
Vous savez quoi ?
Ce n'est pas pour moi.
Écoutez, je vous remercie
de l'opportunité, madame,
mais ça ne suffit pas de faire venir
quelqu'un pour un jour ou deux.
Si vous aviez quelque chose
où je puisse travailler
avec les enfants...
Enfin, merci quand même.
- David.
- Hé.
Je pensais que vous étiez
à Ida Wells.
Un poste d'anglais
s'est libéré ici,
alors que je suis arrivée
l'an dernier.
- Hé. Ça va, entraîneur ?
- Hé.
Vous êtes là pour vos garçons ?
Un programme spécial ?
Non, autre chose.
Ça n'a pas vraiment marché.
Portez-vous bien.
Ça ne vous dérange pas
que je commence ?
- Pas du tout.
- Allez vous faire foutre !
D'accord...
mais tu es encore
dans cette pièce.
Allez vous faire foutre !
Tu ne retourneras pas avec les autres
jusqu'à ce que tu te conduises bien.
- Allez vous faire foutre.
- Jusqu'à ce que tu t'améliores,
tu ne retourneras pas
dans ta classe.
Allez vous faire foutre.
Tu ne rentreras pas chez toi,
parce que tu ne peux plus
être renvoyé.
M. Colvin ?
Allez vous faire foutre.
Parce que j'ai pas envie.
Voilà pourquoi.
C'est des conneries.
Et je ne lis pas
de putain de livre non plus !
Je ne sais même rien
de ce putain de livre.
Et vous m'emmerdez toujours
à propos d'un livre.
Allez vous faire foutre,
connasse !
Albert, Albert, calme-toi.
Ce sera plus dur qu'on ne le pensait.
C'est fascinant, n'est-ce pas ?
Bien.
S'il vous plaît...
Ce n'est pas différent
d'une autre classe...
...D'un point de vue clinique.
Yo, tu as un full.
Fais mieux que moi.
D'accord. Je couvre ça.
- Moi aussi.
- Je parie avec mon pote Randy.
Tu vas te faire prendre
ton argent.
Allez !
- Merci.
- Merci.
Paie, crétin.
Randy, qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
On n'a pas parlé de ça ?
De combien de façons
tu peux faire un quatre ?
Pas assez, apparemment.
Regarde qui parle.
Yo, il est arrivé aujourd'hui
seulement,
il a tout manqué
sur les probabilités.
C'est vrai.
Randy,
il n'y a que trois façons
de faire un quatre,
- mais pour faire un sept...
- Six.
C'est bien. Alors, qu'est-ce
que tu aurais dû jouer ?
J'aurais dû parier
contre son jeu à elle.
Bienvenue parmi nous,
M. Wagstaff.
Allez, joue, mec.
J'ai 40.
J'ai 40 sur ça.
Si on leur fait croire
qu'ils n'apprennent pas, ils apprennent.
Je t'ai cherché partout.
Tu m'as trouvé.
Écoute, je pensais, Sherrod...
on s'y est mal pris
tous les deux.
Écoute, c'est ma faute.
Je pensais que je te connaissais mieux
que toi-même.
Cet endroit... cette saloperie
te fera vite sombrer.
Tu le sais. Tu dois rentrer
à la maison, d'accord ?
Rentre avant ce soir
et on peut régler cette connerie.
J'y ai pensé.
Pourquoi tu ne viens pas
tout de suite ?
Je ne suis pas payé
avant 8h00.
8h00, hein ?
Tu vas bien ?
Juste un peu fatigué, c'est tout.
Alors, je te verrai ce soir,
n'est-ce pas, Sherrod ?
Tu veux m'aider
à prendre sa déposition ?
L'affaire Braddock est au point mort.
Salle 2.
Vous, les anciens combattants du crime,
vous avez bien un nom pour ça ?
"Arme du meurtre"
ou une connerie comme ça ?
J'y crois pas.
Des morceaux de métal
de l'autopsie...
J'en ai trouvé deux dans la cour
de la planque
à une rue de l'allée
où Braddock est tombé.
- Une balle perdue a tué notre gars.
- Hm.
Il tirait sur des bouteilles de bière
et d'eau de javel à des rues de là,
en utilisant des pommes de terre
comme silencieux.
N'importe quoi.
C'est ridicule.
Alors il est mort parce qu'une balle
a manqué une bouteille d'eau de javel.
Et ce connard de Carcetti
est maire
à cause de cette stupidité.
J'adore cette ville, putain.
Vraiment.
Bien joué, Greggs.
Quoi de neuf, les gars ?
Sherrod !
Alors, Rashad a 82 pommes
et 12 amis
qui ont tous faim.
Il regarde ses pommes...
sept ont des vers. 15 sont pourries
et voit que sept pommes
ont des vers.
15 autres sont pourries.
Mais il veut źtre juste
et distribuer les bonnes pommes
en parts égales.
"Distribuer" ?
Donner.
Alors dites "donner".
D'accord.
Combien de pommes reēoit
chacun des amis de Rashad ?
A, 4 ;
B, 5 ;
C, 6 ;
ou D, 7 ?
Prenez votre temps
mais faites-le vite.
Hé. Le négro a dit :
"J'ai des droits",
alors mon garēon a dit :
"Oh, oui ?
Il peut aller ą gauche
et tout droit".
Et pow !
- Calvin, tu as fini ?
- Oui, oui.
- Oui ?
- B, 5.
Comment tu as trouvé si vite ?
Facile.
"B, 5" a la cote.
- Du quoi ?
- Je peux vous montrer si vous voulez.
Ne lui montre pas,
montre-moi.
D'accord.
Vous avez déją fait ēa
avec l'autre classe, pas vrai ?
Alors, vous avez 82 pommes,
12 négros
et puis combien de
bla, bla, bla...
et puis vous avez...
tournicoté autour de celui-lą
et aucun autre.
Alors, la réponse est "B, 5".
Tout le monde comprend ?
Ouais !
"B, 5" a la cote.
"B, 5", et moi je suis une Audi 5000.
SUR ÉCOUTE
"On a notre truc, mais ce n'est
qu'une partie d'un truc plus grand".
La priorité devrait źtre
de s'assurer
que les dossiers par āge sont ą jour
avec toutes les notes reportées,
le rapport standard.
Pendant notre journée aujourd'hui
nous pourrions rencontrer
le Conseiller et candidat démocrate
ą la mairie, Thomas Carcetti,
qui fait une étude
du département.
Alors, si vous laissez
traīner vos fax,
et qu'il les trouve,
c'est mauvais pour vous.
Enfin,
comme la plupart d'entre vous
le sait,
notre Commandant des enquźtes
criminelles, Raymond Foerster,
aprčs une longue lutte
contre le cancer,
est décédé hier soir
ą l'hōpital John Hopkins.
De meilleurs hommages
lui seront rendus.
Laissez-moi simplement
vous dire
que cet homme a servi
39 ans...
et a atteint le rang de colonel...
sans laisser de trace
d'amertume ou de trahison.
Dans ce département, ce n'est pas
une carričre, c'est un miracle.
Il y aura une veille ce soir,
suivie de la présentation
en cercueil mercredi
et une messe d'enterrement,
vendredi.
Le choix de la famille est
que des donations soient faites
aux uvres de charité
préférées du colonel.
Les adresses seront affichées
dans la cafétéria.
C'est tout.
Bunk, je viens de recevoir
tes heures sup pour la semaine.
Viens dans mon bureau
et baisse ton pantalon.
Non, non, non !
Sūrement pas !
Vous videz la cafetičre,
vous en relancez une autre.
D'accord.
Je ne vois pas le bon
de toute faēon.
- Sergent Hauk.
- Oui, Chef.
Je viens de parler ą Beauford
des Affaires Internes.
Il me dit qu'une plainte
a été déposée contre vous.
Une Jamaļcaine dit
que vous l'avez fait arrźter
et fouiller par la police des trains.
Oui. Vous voyez dans mon rapport
que nous avions des informations
crédibles indiquant
qu'elle transportait
de la drogue pour Marlo Stanfield.
En fait, on a ramassé Stanfield
avec elle.
Quelles étaient ces informations ?
L'indicateur est fiable.
Bons antécédents avec nous.
Depuis longtemps.
Indicateur n° 238.
Donnez-moi son nom.
Son nom ? Chef.
Chef !
Je n'ai jamais aimé
citer le nom d'indicateurs
dans les bureaux.
Je pense que c'est...
- Son nom.
- Fuzzy Dunlop, Chef.
Je devrais organiser
un entrevue avec cette personne.
Il n'aime pas trop les rencontres.
Il est fiable,
je vous assure.
Moi aussi, j'ai été surpris.
Mais il ne s'est jamais trompé, jamais.
Vous avez agi sur de mauvaises
informations, Sergent.
Vous avez fait intervenir
un autre département
et vous avez discrédité
cette unité...
mon unité.
Mais de bonne foi, Chef.
Quoi qu'il advienne de ēa,
je ferai un rapport sur vous
et vous enterrerai avec.
Et au cas
oł vous n'auriez pas
fait attention
aux résultats des élections,
votre rabbin n'est plus des nōtres.
- Pas de colčres aujourd'hui ?
- Ēa sert ą quoi ?
Ils ne vont mźme pas
nous renvoyer, c'est ēa ?
Oui.
Ēa sert ą quoi ?
Alors, nous sommes lą,
que vous le vouliez ou non.
Si cela peut vous réconforter,
on dit ą l'école
que vous źtes lą parce que
vous avez défié le systčme.
Cela ne vous intéressait pas
d'źtre en classe
et vous avez rendu la classe
impossible pour tous les autres
et maintenant vous źtes exclus.
Vous avez gagné.
- Ha ha. Ouais !
- Vous źtes fiers ?
- Toujours.
- C'est ce qu'on a fait.
Qui, on ?
- Nous.
- Non, qui źtes vous ?
- Des vendeurs.
- Des caļds ?
Non, ēa vient plus tard.
Maintenant, on est que
des gars des rues.
Quand deviendrez-vous des caļds ?
Dans deux-trois ans, je pense.
Deux, trois ans.
Laissez-moi vous demander,
et écrivez tous cela...
oł vous imaginez-vous
dans 10 ans ?
Allez, papier et crayon.
Ce n'est pas du travail d'école,
ēa vous concerne tous.
Elle est jeune,
mais elle est bien.
Oui, elle fait un doctorat en psycho
ą College Park.
Sa thčse est sur l'aliénation
sociale et l'analyse.
Bon, levez la main,
combien ont écrit "NBA" ?
Oui, mais seulement
pour les Lakers.
Je veux źtre
neurochirurgien pédiatrique
comme ce négro,
c'est quoi son nom ?
- Ben Carson.
- Oui, ce mec.
C'est un chirurgien
trčs en vue ą Hopkins.
Pour devenir chirurgien,
tu dois aller ą l'école de médecine.
Comme vous voudrez.
Combien d'entre vous
ont écrit "mort" ?
Vous l'avez vu venir, hein ?
Dommage que vous ayez si peu
de temps et le gāchiez ici avec nous.
Vous savez oł vous allez.
Nous ne pouvons rien vous apprendre
que vous ne sachiez ą ce sujet.
C'est ce qu'on vous répčte.
Namond, range ce magazine.
Je ne lis pas de magazine.
- Namond.
- Quoi ?
Il n'est mźme pas ą moi.
Il était posé lą
quand je suis arrivé.
Vous źtes tous des petits crétins.
Vous savez, nous leur donnons
une bonne éducation.
"Il n'est mźme pas ą moi.
Il était posé lą
quand je suis arrivé".
Vous savez...
l'école...
leur faēon de se comporter,
c'est un entraīnement
pour la rue.
Le bātiment, c'est le systčme,
et nous, les flics.
Ouais, vous en źtes bien un.
Vous venez ici tous les jours
et vous vous entraīnez
ą trouver des excuses,
ą jouer ą divers jeux.
C'est un entraīnement
pour la rue, non ?
Il n'y a pas de vrais flics.
Il n'y a pas de vrai danger.
Mais vous profiterez tous
de cet endroit.
Je parie que vous le saviez
mźme pas.
Quand mźme, je préférerais
źtre dehors.
Je peux ?
Des gars de la rue, hein ?
Laissez-moi vous poser
une question.
Aidez-nous
ą avancer sur ce sujet
et peut-źtre que nous travaillerons
un peu mieux avec vous.
- Qu'est-ce qui fait un bon dealer ?
- Faut garder les yeux ouverts.
- Compter correctement.
- Ne faire confiance ą personne.
Si tu es stupide,
tu te fais tuer.
C'est tout.
Et je dois dire
que ce nom sent mauvais.
- Témoin oculaire, Bunk.
- Retournez sur les lieux, Vernon,
- et regardez ą nouveau.
- Vous exagérez, Bunk, vraiment.
Beaucoup de noms. Trop.
Non, ēa nous va.
Écoutez, espčce
de connard de seconde classe,
le gars l'a désigné...
Omar Little.
Pourquoi lui ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on en a ą foutre ?
On a une contribuable morte
sur les bras
- et quelqu'un dit que c'est lui.
- Je ne marche pas.
Et réfléchissez au personnage.
Ce n'est pas le type
qui a trouvé les 62 faēons
de préparer la cacahučte.
Son nom apparaīt dans cinq ou six affaires
dont je suis au courant...
y compris deux des vōtres...
et vous voulez le remettre dehors ?
Mais ce n'est pas lui.
Cela veut dire que quelqu'un
d'autre vous passe par-dessus.
Laissez-moi vous dire, Bunk :
le prochain corps
que vous ramassez,
je mettrai mon nez dedans,
je vous contrōlerai ą chaque pas,
je tirerai sur toutes les putain de ficelles.
On verra si ēa vous fait plaisir.
Hé, Vernon.
Vernon, Vernon,
Vernon, Vernon.
- Reste avec moi sur ce coup-lą.
- Quoi ?
Ēa ne change rien.
Je t'en serai vraiment reconnaissant.
Vous n'źtes pas obligés
de faire des choses
que vous ne faites pas normalement
parce que je suis lą.
Je ne sais pas ce qu'on fait
normalement.
Je suis nouvelle
et sans expérience.
Oh, vous źtes...
Oui. C'est moi.
Sérieusement, j'essaie seulement
d'avoir une idée
de la réaction du département
ą la violence.
Je ne suis pas un surveillant
ou quoi que ce soit.
Alors, c'est ēa, votre journée ?
Si on ramasse un corps,
c'est différent.
Je crois que t'as ma caméra.
- J'ai quoi ?
- Permis et carte grise.
Faisons un échange de bons principes.
Vous avez un badge ?
Police de la ville, hein ?
La caméra vidéo doit revenir.
Oui, je vais essayer
de me renseigner.
Mais vous savez, les caméras...
c'est comme les pigeons
dans la tempźte.
Pigé ?
Parfois, elles reviennent.
Parfois...
Mais je garderai l'il ouvert.
Hé, Jim, il a parlé
de pigeons ?
Il se fout de toi.
Écoute, dis seulement ą Marimow
que tu as utilisé la caméra ą la gare
et admets que la caméra
a été volée.
Je l'ai déją signalé
ą l'inspecteur.
Si je dis la vérité
au grand connard,
- il me retirera des galons.
- Oh, voyons.
Écoute, t'as pas été renvoyé
si longtemps.
C'est ą cause de Tiff
ou parce que tu devais faire
quelque chose pour Mlle Donnelly ?
- Faire quelque chose ?
- Une promesse ou quelque chose.
Non, c'est Tiff.
C'est rien de plus.
C'est bien. Tu sais, les profs
et les flics, ils s'en prennent
toujours ą nous
comme s'ils nous tenaient
par la peau du cul.
Mais si on la ferme,
ils ne peuvent rien faire.
Et la plupart du temps,
ils laissent tomber.
Je te le garantis.
Ēa n'a mźme pas d'importance.
Et Mlle Anna,
elle me tient en laisse
en ce moment.
Je ne peux pas sortir
sans qu'elle sache oł je vais.
Merde, au moins tu as
une laisse.
Dewey !
Mais qu'est-ce que c'est
que ēa ?
De l'eau gazeuse
et du citron vert.
T'as la mémoire courte.
Je devrais te sucer
et en finir.
Ēa t'enlčvera le mauvais goūt
de la bouche.
Ouais.
Presque neuve.
On ne porte pas
le chapeau d'un mort.
Je déconne.
Allez, prions.
Nous enterrons deux gars
de New York
qui sont descendus
un peu trop loin vers le sud.
Le putain de Yankee est fier
maintenant, espčce de salopes.
Faut dégager d'ici, putain.
T'as faim ?
Tu veux de la bouffe chinoise ?
Silence.
Gardez les yeux sur votre contrōle.
Yo, M. Prezbo,
ēa dit "voitures".
- Et alors ?
- Nos exercices parlaient de nourriture.
Pas de problčme.
C'est juste un objet différent.
Fais attention au nombre.
Les nombres sont faux aussi.
On n'a jamais fait un tiers.
C'est la mźme opération...
1/4, 1/5, 1/3.
Suivez le mźme procédé.
C'est un autre dénominateur.
Comment on peut obtenir
1/3 d'une voiture ?
En fait, c'est 1/3
de toutes les voitures.
Je te parlais ?!
Si tu t'approches assez,
tu pourrais tirer
dans la tźte. Pourquoi ?
Il a peut-źtre un gilet pare-balles.
Bien vu. Une balle dans la poitrine
ne marchera peut-źtre pas.
Alors quoi ? Toi.
- C'est son tour.
- Thug, c'est ą toi.
Si tu dois tirer de loin,
tu ne peux pas risquer
un tir ą la tźte.
Tu dois tirer dans le ventre,
la bite ou le cul.
Parce que le gilet
le descend pas si bas.
Bam ! Tu les descends.
- Et aprčs ?
- Faut s'approcher,
- pour les achever.
- Avec une... ?
Balle dans la tźte.
Nom de Dieu, vous y mettez
tous la dose.
C'est clair. C'est clair.
Maintenant disons
qu'il est dans une voiture.
Sergent Thomas Hauk,
Police de la ville de Baltimore.
Je t'avais pas dit
qu'ils viendraient en courant ?
- Oui.
- J'ai vérifié ce rigolo pour vous.
Pour voir ce qu'il en est.
Autre chose,
vous faites bien
de faire dégager
les négros de New York
hors du quartier est. Je le sais.
Mais votre truc,
des corps qui disparaissent...
Mon pote dit que si vous faites
disparaītre les corps comme ēa,
ēa ne rime plus ą rien.
Les négros ne savent pas
s'ils sont retournés
dans le Bronx ou quoi.
- Tu piges ?
- Bien sūr.
Je le dirai ą mes gars.
Sans vouloir manquer de respect
ą ton professionnalisme.
On est tous impressionnés
par ta faēon de te débarrasser
de ces salauds.
On essaie seulement
de faire passer le message
ą ces gars de New York,
tu piges ?
Je te tiens au jus.
Alors, monsieur,
vous avez joué les inspecteurs
de police hier.
Vous avez vu quelque chose
d'important ?
Ils se sont trompés
dans la commande pour le déjeuner.
J'avais besoin d'aller sur le terrain,
c'est pour ēa que je suis lą.
Patrouiller avec les plus forts
ą l'est de l'est...
Souvenez-vous qu'un coup de feu
a été tiré la semaine derničre.
Gardez ces salauds en vue.
Ne vous laissez pas encercler.
Si on avait un camion rempli
de gars comme vous,
- on trouverait ce salopard.
- Quoi ?
Habillé comme ēa, Stevie Wonder
aurait l'air d'un flic.
Cachez votre radio.
Volume au max.
10 $,
on relčve le col d'abord.
20 ēa vaut la peine.
M. le Maire, vous savez ce qui est super
chez les gars du quartier est ?
On est des salopards affamés,
avec tout le respect que je vous dois.
Alors, tu dis
que t'es jamais indulgent
avec personne ?
- Personne ?
- Non, non.
Parce que si on laisse
passer pour un dollar,
c'est un signe de faiblesse.
Aujourd'hui, c'est un dollar,
demain ce sera deux.
Ouais, pareil avec ton équipe.
Si ton gars te déēoit,
cafte ą la police
ou quoi que ce soit,
si tu le laisses faire,
alors il te marchera sur les pieds.
- Alors, tu es un pauvre con.
- Tu dois le niquer.
- Ouais.
- Tu dois lui casser la gueule.
Non, non. Si quelque chose
arrive pour de vrai, tu fais ēa.
Si tu le fais pour des conneries,
- alors tu perds un bon travailleur.
- Oh, non.
Mec, tu dois niquer ce négro.
Arrźtez de parler tous ensemble.
C'est comme ēa
que vous communiquez dans la rue ?
Ēa se passe comme ēa :
ton gars revient
- en disant que ceci ou cela est arrivé...
- Tu le niques.
Ą mon avis, je dois le laisser
compenser avec sa part.
Si c'est un bon vendeur,
il sait ce qu'il doit faire.
Ouais, tu as raison.
Il a raison.
Bien vu.
S'il réfléchit,
dit que c'est pas sa faute,
alors ce négro
se moque de toi.
Et alors, tu le niques.
- Ouais.
- D'accord, oui.
- Mais pourquoi ?
- Ēa doit arriver.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire !
Attendez, attendez !
Un ą la fois.
- Un ą la fois, vous tous.
- Yo, yo, D, dis-lui.
Il y a toujours des gens
qui regardent.
- Qui... te regardent.
- C'est vrai. Ouais...
Qu'est-ce qui vous prend
si longtemps, les gars ?
Le voilą.
Vite, vite, ce gars.
Ce gars-lą.
Allez vous faire foutre.
Hé, yo, yo.
Yo, mec, on a besoin de cachetons.
Alors t'es au bon endroit, mec.
- Va nous en chercher.
- Enfin, mec, je vais au boulot.
Yo, 20 pour les cachetons
et 10 pour toi.
- Laisse le vélo.
- Quoi, tu veux me voler mon vélo ?
Pourquoi je voudrais ton vélo ?
J'ai une bagnole.
Donne-moi un instant.
20 $, ce n'est peut-źtre
rien pour toi.
Mais je ne gagne pas
tellement d'argent.
C'est de l'argent durement gagné.
Vous źtes tous
des paresseux.
La came est juste
au coin de la rue.
Tu n'as pas idée
comme j'apprécie.
J'adore quand ils viennent travailler
gonflés ą bloc comme ēa.
Merde.
Laissez-moi. Je vais travailler.
Laissez-moi, je vais travailler !
C'est des conneries !
C'est des conneries.
C'est vrai ! C'est vrai !
J'ai pas de drogue sur moi.
J'ai rien sur moi.
Et vous prenez mon vélo, aussi ?!
J'en ai besoin.
C'est un coup monté !
Un de moins.
C'est un coup monté.
André, comment ēa va ?
Voici un de mes amis,
l'Inspecteur Moreland.
Ēa va ?
Alors, écoute, pour mon ami,
tu vas me répéter encore une fois
comment c'est arrivé,
d'accord ?
- Le gars est entré.
- Omar ?
- Omar.
- Il a pointé le 9 mm sur elle.
Il m'a dit :
"Tout ce que tu as".
Un 9 mm, hein ?
Et t'étais oł ?
- Lą oł vous me voyez.
- Mm-hm.
Du 9 mm ne traverserait pas ēa.
- Pourquoi t'es sorti ?
- Parce qu'il me l'a dit.
Il essayait de sauver
la vie de la femme.
Oui, c'est ce que je dis...
C'est comme les vitres
de la Banque d'Angleterre.
Les vitres de Fort Knox.
Et qui a fait ēa lą-haut ? Hein ?
Ce gars devait avoir un fusil
ą éléphant ou un truc comme ēa.
Je ne sais pas.
Le gars portait un masque.
Un masque, hein ?
Comme Zorro, hein ?
- Quand est-ce que c'est arrivé ?
- Il y a quelques semaines.
- Et tu l'as signalé ?
- J'ai oublié.
André
On va devoir te demander
de venir au bureau
pour expliquer
deux ou trois choses.
Je tiens un commerce.
Je ne vais nulle part.
Donne-moi un flacon de Mylanta,
s'il te plaīt.
Son histoire tient pas la route
et voici pourquoi :
d'abord, ēa n'a aucun sens.
Le tireur a flingué la femme
et l'a laissé vivre
pour qu'il raconte tout.
Il devrait źtre mort aussi.
Secondo, ce truc est
un dépōt de drogue.
Le verre, le blindage,
la caméra, les étagčres vides.
Et, troisičmement,
il se moque de nous
ą propos de ce gros trou
de calibre 50
parce que je sais
qui l'a fait, et il sait qui l'a fait.
Et s'il disait :
"Oh, ēa ? C'était aussi Omar
qui est venu voler
la réappro..."
et c'est ce qui est arrivé...
il serait foutu.
Alors quoi ?
Un type vient la premičre fois
avec un calibre 50 parce qu'il sait
que le verre est épais
et puis revient
la semaine suivante avec un 9 mm ?
Notre boulot n'est pas de choisir
les histoires qu'on préfčre.
Maintenant tu vas me faire
un cours sur mon boulot ?
- Mes excuses.
- Bon. Allons au centre-ville.
C'est une nouvelle loi, yo...
trois pilules, c'est un délit grave.
Et tu es ą un coin
oł il y a déją eu des arrestations ?
- Quoi ?
- Tu ferais bien de montrer ta planque.
Lą, ēa dépasse tout.
Les gars de Washington sont lą.
Ils adorent se faire
les jeunots de Baltimore.
- Mm-mm.
- Je connais pas de planque.
Ils disent que c'est meilleur
que la chatte.
- Elles sont ą moi ces pilules.
- Ouais.
Tu as entendu parler
des rčglements fédéraux ?
Les coins oł il y a eu
des arrestations, mon gars.
C'est trois ans obligatoires,
sauf circonstances atténuantes.
- Circonstances quoi ?
- La planque, gamin.
Je connais pas de planque.
Ces pilules sont ą moi.
Je suis défoncé, regardez.
Ouais.
Ils vont l'adorer lą-bas.
Allez, viens.
- Je l'ai vu en premier.
- Ah oui ?
- Cette salope est ą moi.
- Les pilules sont ą moi, je le jure.
Ēa en fait deux.
Entre dans la voiture, putain.
Merde, les fractions ?
Il fait des fractions.
Tu veux savoir de quoi on a parlé
dans ma nouvelle classe aujourd'hui ?
- De quoi ?
- Des dealers.
Yo, je ne plaisante pas.
On a parlé du business,
de la vente de la came
dans la rue.
Négro, s'il te plaīt.
C'est nous qui leur apprenions
des trucs.
Yo, ma nouvelle classe,
c'est de la balle.
Tu passes ą la salle
de boxe aujourd'hui ?
Non, mec.
Je dois mettre en sachets
ce qui reste de ce paquet
pour pouvoir me ravitailler.
D'accord.
- D'accord, mec.
- Peace, mec.
C'est facile, non ?
Je dois bientōt partir, Duquan.
D'accord.
Tu es au quel niveau ?
12.
Moi, je n'ai jamais dépassé le 10.
Vous voulez que j'aille au 40 ?
C'est de la triche.
Vous voulez que je vous montre
comment faire ?
Police de Baltimore.
Oui, Madame,
ici Sydney Lebranleur
de Lebranleur, Cohen & Bromburg.
J'essaie de localiser
le Sergent Thomas Hauk
en référence ą un client
que je représente.
Ne quittez pas.
Bureau du Maire,
Lieutenant Hoskins.
Oui, allō.
C'est Ervin Poivre
de Poivre, Poivre
& Feuilledelaurier.
J'appelle au sujet du Sergent
Thomas Hauk en référence ą un...
Il n'est plus dans ce service.
Ne quittez pas.
Criminelle.
Puis-je vous aider ?
Ici le Dr. Jay. J'ai des résultats
d'analyses pour Thomas Hauk.
Il est sorti.
Voulez-vous laisser
un message ?
Allō ?
C'est parti.
Tu dois seulement
l'aborder, d'accord ?
T'en choisis un.
On doit s'assurer qu'il est
de New York d'abord, n'est-ce pas ?
Tu dois lui demander.
Lui demander quoi ?
"T'es de New York ?"
Non, pose une question
sur Baltimore,
un truc qu'un négro
de New York saurait pas.
- Quoi sur Baltimore ?
- Je ne sais pas,
peut-źtre sur les clubs de musique.
Ils ne savent rien de ces conneries
ą New York.
Hein ?
Demande-lui qui est Young Leek.
Ou K-Swift.
Je ne sais rien sur ces conneries
de la radio 92Q, mec.
Tout le monde s'en fout.
Tu ne connais pas Marc Clarke ?
L'émission "The Big Phat
Morning Show" ?
T'as un problčme, poupée.
Le négro moyen de Baltimore
connaīt tous ces trucs.
Ils écoutent pas ces trucs
ą New York.
Ils écoutent de la merde
ą New York.
- Vas-y.
- D'accord, comme tu voudras.
Hé, je fais un pari, mec.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Qui est ton préféré
dans "The Big Phat
Morning Show", yo ?
Quoi, t'es une tapette de New York ?
Sonjay.
- Qui ? Qui ?
- Je kiffe cette émission.
Snoop ! Snoop, yo !
Snoop, yo ! Yo !
Du calme ! Sonjay est
aussi dans l'émission.
C'est moi qui vais poser
les questions, d'accord ?
Et puis, ils tendent un pičge
ą un pauvre imbécile,
ramassent 20 $ de drogue.
Ils doivent faire la paperasse, le nourrir,
faire une saisie légale de son vélo.
Ensuite, ils traitent
un dealer de 14 ans
comme s'il était Bin Laden.
La grosse prise, c'était
trois sachets de cocaļne.
Vous źtes pour ēa ?
Je me bats contre ces conneries
depuis des années.
La seule faēon de faire,
c'est la répression de haut niveau.
Il faut choisir des cibles
importantes
qui réduiront la violence.
Alors, quel est le problčme ?
Le problčme, c'est que je fais
ce qu'on me dit.
Ce qui veut dire ?
M. le Maire, je ne suis pas
plus raciste que vous.
Le truc avec
la discrimination positive...
je parle de politique ici,
sans vouloir vous offenser...
- Pas de problčme.
- ... c'est un jeu de chiffres.
Et les jeux de chiffres
génčrent plus de jeux de chiffres.
Il vous faut une augmentation de 20 %
des embauches de policiers noirs
pour aller de pair
avec la population de la ville.
Mais cela doit aussi se refléter
au bout de la chaīne
ce qui veut dire promouvoir
des gens au-delą de leurs...
comment dire...
Il y a des agents expérimentés.
Et celui qui doit
sa bonne fortune aux chiffres,
les respecte.
Il faut monter que les arrestations
sont en hausse de 15-20 %.
La qualité passe aprčs.
Ce que vous avez vu,
c'est une escroquerie,
un pansement pour guérir des cancers.
Alors, non, je ne suis pas pour ēa,
mais j'exécute les ordres.
Cependant, si les ordres
devaient changer,
ou si j'avais l'occasion
de les changer moi-mźme...
Oh non, pas question
que tu fasses ēa !
Qu'est-ce que cette came
fait dans ma maison ?
Je remplis des sachets, Maman.
Tu as déją vu ton papa
apporter son travail
ą la maison comme ēa ?
C'est pour ēa
que tu as un lieutenant.
Si la police était entrée ici
au lieu de ta mčre,
ils fouilleraient toute la maison.
Tout ēa doit źtre emballé
et źtre sorti d'ici tout de suite.
D'accord, sois cool.
Attends que Bey entende ēa.
T'as entendu ce cul-nu
faire appel ą la solidarité raciale ?
J'aimerais botter
son petit cul de gradé.
T'as écouté ?
Il n'est pas plus raciste que moi.
Je devrais peut-źtre
te botter le cul aussi.
Qu'est-ce que t'as entendu
sur Daniels ?
Major dans le quartier ouest.
Oui, il est lą-bas
mais pas vraiment politiquement.
Je ne crois pas
qu'il ait de l'influence.
Oł est le Rice-A-Roni ?
Maman, oł est le Rice-A-Roni ?
Il y avait un garēon
sur le palier
qui avait l'air
de mourir de faim.
Alors tu l'as cuisiné pour lui ?
Non, je lui ai simplement donné.
Tu lui as simplement donné.
Le garēon a mangé une boīte
de Rice-A-Roni cru.
Combien tu as vendu
les provisions ?
Ne me regarde pas comme ēa.
Je dois sortir.
- 10 $ ?
- T'as tes bénéfices sur le Rice-A-Roni.
Michael, allez !
Je ne te laisserai pas garder
la carte du Service Social
si tu ne te conduis pas bien
avec moi.
Tu me laisseras cette carte.
Tu es un enfant sans coeur.
La prochaine fois, ne nous enlčve pas
la nourriture de la bouche !
Ouais, comme vous dites tous...
ne mentez pas,
ne faites pas de conneries,
ne trichez pas,
ne volez pas.
Et vous tous, hein ?
Et le gouvernement ?
Quoi... Enron ? Ha !
Les stéroļdes, oui.
Le commerce de l'alcool.
C'est la gnōle qui tue.
Et les cigarettes...
Oh, merde.
Hé, vous avez des cigarettes
lą-dedans ?
J'essaie d'arrźter.
Et la drogue paye
votre salaire, c'est ēa ?
Pas exactement,
mais je vois ce que tu veux dire.
On fait la mźme chose
que vous tous,
mais vous dites : "Oh mon Dieu,
ces gosses sont des monstres".
Comme si la fin du monde arrivait.
C'est des conneries, non ?
C'est... comment on dit...
hypocrite.
Ouais, on a notre truc,
- mais ēa fait partie d'un plus grand truc.
- Exactement.
Mais ce truc de dealer de rue ?
Vous n'avez parlé
que de ēa.
Vous pensez que vous pourriez
vous asseoir
et écrire les rčgles
de votre business ?
Mais oui, je vais le faire
tout de suite.
Merde.
Non, je voulais dire...
vous pouvez le faire ensemble ?
Je fais un test sur les fractions,
la moitié des gosses craquent.
J'ai beaucoup de gosses qui manient
ą peine les nombres entiers.
Si cela peut vous consoler,
j'en ai,
en dehors de ma classe avancée,
peut-źtre une demi-douzaine
qui savent lire au niveau de leur classe.
Essayez donc de leur apprendre
le tableau des éléments.
Le truc, c'est que c'est
votre programme
et vous devez le respecter.
- Je ne peux pas. C'est absurde.
- Vous devez.
Le test en avril déterminera
si État prend l'école
en mains ou non.
Peut-źtre que l'état
devrait le faire.
Vous n'enseignez pas les maths,
vous préparez les élčves au test.
North Avenue
est l'incarnation
de "aucun enfant
laissé pour compte".
Et qu'est-ce qu'ils apprennent ?
Faites des compromis.
Chaque jour, essayez de travailler
un peu sur le test
et laissez un problčme
au tableau pour Donnelly.
Vous savez, si elle fait une visite,
elle pensera
que vous źtes ą jour.
Le reste du temps,
faites ce que vous sentez
devoir faire.
Mais faites attention.
Vous źtes encore loin d'obtenir
une bonne note de l'inspection.
La premičre année,
il ne s'agit pas des gosses
mais de votre survie.
Levez-vous.
Levez-vous !
Les mains sur la tźte.
- Je mangeais.
- Va te faire foutre.
- C'est mon déjeuner.
- Va te faire foutre.
Contre le mur, connards.
Levez les pieds.
- C'est du harcčlement.
- Qu'est-ce que je t'ai dit ?
"Va te faire foutre".
C'est ce que vous m'avez dit.
Il n'y a rien ici.
Oups, je m'excuse.
Tu veux jouer avec moi ?
Je vais tous vous faire chier
comme ēa tous les jours
jusqu'ą ce que ma caméra revienne.
Tu m'entends ?
Tous les jours.
Toi et tes copains.
Allons-y.
Ah, ēa m'a fait du bien !
Les bons vieux raids
des stups sont de retour.
Oui ?
Respectueusement, Monsieur,
je préfčrerais
que vous passiez
par la hiérarchie.
Oui, Monsieur.
Je vais y réfléchir.
- Un problčme avec les patrons ?
- Un en particulier.
- C'était notre futur maire.
- Carcetti ?
Sérieusement ?
Il veut me rencontrer.
Toi et lui ? Seuls ?
Il veut parler
du Département de police...
ce qui marche,
ce qui ne marche pas.
Le maire veut ton avis !
Regarde-toi.
Mais voilą :
qu'est-ce que je dis ?
Comment ēa,
qu'est-ce que tu dis ?
Ą quel point devrais-je źtre honnźte ?
C'est une chose de parler
des conneries techniques,
des stratégies de répression
mais les conneries
qui se passent vraiment ?
Si je commence ą parler de ēa,
je ne sais pas oł je m'arrźterai.
Cedric, c'est une chance pour toi.
C'est ta carričre.
Et si je tire sur Burrell et Rawls
et qu'il décide de ne pas faire
le ménage. Alors quoi ?
Le nouveau maire t'appelle,
te demande ton opinion
et tu ne veux pas źtre
un politique ?
Carcetti... euh.
Je ne le connais mźme pas.
S'il t'appelle,
c'est parce que des gars comme Burrell
et Rawls sont en mauvaise posture.
- Peut-źtre.
- Je sais qu'il y a un risque,
mais si j'étais toi...
j'irais jusqu'au bout.
Je vais attendre dehors, mec.
Cool.
J'attendrai. J'attendrai.
T'as la bouffe,
t'as l'herbe ?
Ah, attends.
Qui a fait cette chanson ?
Yo, ą qui tu parles, mec ?
Je demande qui est Young Leek.
Tu veux dire le cousin
de 2 Phat ?
- Qui ?
- Non.
Pourquoi je devrais
le savoir, merde ?!
Yo, putain, ą qui tu parles...
- Oh, merde.
- Pas mal.
Rien ą foutre de ce négro.
Quoi de neuf, B ?
- Oł est Maman ?
- En haut.
Michael, mon papa
est rentré ą la maison.
Papa est rentré
ą la maison ?
- Regarde qui est lą !
- Michael.
T'as sacrément grandi.
Et un paquet de Kools
pour Macia.
Tu fais encore la pute
pour ce rigolo ?
Je ne comprends pas pourquoi
on dit des saletés sur lui.
- Tout ce que je sais, c'est qu'il m'aime.
- Quand tu seras fatiguée
qu'il te tabasse et tout,
tu sauras vraiment
qui t'aime.
Tout ce que tu voudras.
Quoi, putain ?
TRIBUNAL DE LA CIRCONSCRIPTION
DE BALTIMORE
Il en avait pour 12 ans.
Libéré en conditionnelle.
Ce n'était qu'une inculpation
pour drogue.
Tu avais juré
qu'il ne reviendrait pas.
C'est une bonne chose, Michael.
Ēa sera de nouveau
comme avant.
Comme avant ?
On est de nouveau une famille.
Tu m'as menti.
Les gens changent, Michael.
Il a dit que tu peux lui rendre
la carte de l'aide sociale.
Il s'occupera de tout ēa
pour nous.
Merci d'źtre venue
de Washington.
Le parti est heureux
de cette occasion.
Vous źtes chaleureusement soutenu.
- Mais mettons-nous au travail.
- Ą notre avis,
nous devons organiser
un changement dans toute la ville,
appelez ēa le "Miracle de Baltimore".
Qui commence avec une diminution
de 10 % de la criminalité.
Comme c'était
votre slogan de campagne,
- vous devez dépasser les 10 %.
- Sans aucun doute.
Denny doit construire quelque chose
au centre-ville,
et le baptiser
de son nom.
On regorge de stades,
on a des hōtels
ą revendre.
Vous avez un bon palais
des congrčs ?
- Et une expansion du palais des congrčs.
- Il faut construire quelque chose,
placer une pancarte dessus
qui dise :
"Pour vous,
grāce ą Tommy Carcetti
et aux citoyens de Baltimore".
Réfléchissez ą cela,
- mais vous avez peu de temps.
- Autre chose ?
L'éducation rapporte toujours des voix.
Oh non, ne touchons pas
aux écoles.
Nos quatre derniers maires
nous ont laissé un systčme urbain
avec des problčmes urbains.
Si on s'en mźle et qu'on dit
des conneries,
ēa deviendra notre problčme.
Il faut se rendre compte
que c'est trop.
Un, vous avez
la diminution de la criminalité,
deux, vous construisez
quelque chose au centre-ville ;
et trois, vous ne parlez pas
des écoles.
Et, quatre, vous gardez
votre belle allure de gamin.
Faites ēa et vous pourriez vous
présenter comme gouverneur en 2008,
et reprendre le capitole de notre état ?
- Tu peux lui faire un coin carré ?
- Facile.
Ēa va ?
Oui.
Tu es sūr ?
- C'est quelque chose ą la maison ?
- Non.
- Allez...
- J'ai dit non.
D'accord.
Si jamais tu veux parler
de quelque chose,
je suis lą,
mais si tu préfčres,
je peux te faire un mot
pour voir l'assistante sociale.
Dis-moi simplement quand.
Michael, tu veux voir
l'assistante sociale ?
Non.
Je dois dire que je n'ai jamais vu
des enfants comme eux
aussi vifs en classe.
Concentrés... les gosses
des rues, du moins.
Ceux qui ont des problčmes
plus profonds n'ont pas mordu.
- Des problčmes plus profonds ?
- Il y a d'autres problčmes.
Je vois des troubles
de rébellion,
de dépression clinique,
de stress post-traumatique,
et avec la jeune Shaundra,
peut-źtre de psychose.
Avec ce genre de problčmes,
nous devrons avoir une assistante
sociale ą temps complet.
Mais les gosses de rue
se sont vraiment animés.
Oui, quand ils parlent
de ce qu'ils savent,
ils parlent de lą
et restent concentrés.
Merde, ils ont mźme parlé
ą tour de rōle.
La question est :
pouvons-nous les mettre
dans cet d'état d'esprit pour des trucs
qu'ils ne connaissent pas ?
Pouvons-nous les faire apprendre
seulement sur la confiance ?
En toute honnźteté,
c'est un territoire inconnu.
Oł va-t-on ą partir de lą ?
Et si on laissait cela évoluer
pour voir oł cela nous mčne ?
Bon, écoute,
alors voilą :
une fois que tu l'as,
c'est uniquement toi.
Si quelque chose arrive,
je devrai te niquer la gueule.
Ouais, mais c'est rien.
Parce que le gars qui me fait
confiance pour ēa... Marlo...
il te tuera toi et toute ta famille.
Alors, ne t'amuse pas
ą piquer de la came,
parce que Marlo la pčse
ą chaque fois.
- Je ne pique pas de came.
- Ne le fais pas,
parce que si tu déconnes,
je le saurai.
Bon, c'est bien.
Bon, c'est bien.
Bon, tu vois, tu as moins
de 13 ans.
Alors, tu es ą l'abri de tout le monde
ą part moi et Marlo.
- Alors, je suis lieutenant maintenant ?
- Ouais.
Tu es mon lieutenant.
Et tout ce que je reēois,
c'est 10 $ de plus ?
Oui, fais ēa bien
et on en reparlera.
Vous voyez ce gars, lą ?
C'est le procureur du grand jury.
Si vous nous mentez,
c'est de la rigolade.
Mais si vous racontez des histoires
ą ce salopard, oh, merde !
Je ne dis pas de mensonges.
Hé, Gary, une question hypothétique :
combien d'années prend un témoin
s'il ment ą un grand jury ?
Vous plaisantez ?
Autant que je peux demander.
- Quel est le maximum ?
- 10 ans.
Oh, il y a des gens
qui vont en prison pour 10 ans ?
Oh, oui, tout le temps.
10 ans !
Je croyais qu'il allait dire
deux ou trois.
Hé, dites, ce salopard
m'a tabassé.
Je ne voyais plus clair.
De quel salopard vous parlez ?
Et puis, ils m'ont donné
un médicament.
Ēa m'a complčtement sonné.
Et puis ce gars a commencé
ą me cuisiner...
- Mon cul !
- Merde !
Je suis encore sonné.
Je dois...
Il y a des toilettes par ici ?
- Salopard de menteur !
- Vraiment.
Arrźte-toi, connard.
Merde.
Sortez de la voiture, s'il vous plaīt.
Sortez de la voiture.
Mettez les mains
sur la voiture.
Vous avez quelque chose
sur vous ?
Asseyez-vous sur le trottoir.
Asseyez-vous.
Croisez les jambes.
Mettez les mains sur la tźte.
C'est quoi cette poudre ?
De la chaux, pour le jardin
de ma maman.
Vous construisez quoi,
un chalet ?
Oh, y'a des clous lą-dedans.
Faites doucement.
Oh, je sais ce que ēa fait.
Je veux ma putain de caméra.
J'ai entendu ce que vous avez dit
ą Comstat l'autre jour.
Je sais aussi que vous źtes
un commandant compétent.
C'est ce qu'on dit.
Hier, j'ai patrouillé
dans le quartier est,
observé des descentes dans la rue,
des coups en civil.
- Alors, qu'est-ce que j'en pense ?
- Ce que je devine :
vous avez été témoin d'un gāchis
de temps, d'argent, d'énergie
et, dans de rares cas, de talent.
Rawls dit que c'est Burrell
et son jeu avec les chiffres.
Il dit que si je lui donne libre cours,
alors toutes ces conneries
disparaītront.
La police fera ą nouveau
un travail de haut niveau,
et il dit que ce sera l'aube
d'un nouveau jour.
- Rawls a dit ēa ?
- Oui.
Il dit qu'il suit simplement les ordres
en étant un bon soldat.
Qu'est-ce que vous en dites ?
M. le Maire, si vous voulez
me parler
ą propos de ce qui se passe
dans la rue
ou ce qui se passe en dessous
de moi dans le quartier ouest,
je ne pourrai pas
m'arrźter de parler.
Mais je suis aussi un soldat.
Je ne remonte pas la hiérarchie
avec mes opinions.
Je respecte cela.
Je dirai ceci cependant :
nous avions une unité
qui faisait du travail de haut niveau...
La Criminelle travaillait
depuis un local extérieur
sur Clinton Street.
"Avions", c'est le passé.
Qu'est-ce qui l'a détruite ?
Bonne question, M. le Maire.
Ray Foerster étant décédé,
j'aurai besoin d'un nouveau
commandant des enquźtes criminelles.
Auriez-vous une objection ą passer
colonel, sous les ordres de Rawls ?
Sous les ordres de Rawls ?
Il est sous-préfet, n'est-ce pas ?
Le Maire va-t-il faire
les changements
ou laisser cela au bon soldat ?
Je vous demande vraiment :
concrétiserez-vous vos idées ?
Nous le verrons ensemble,
n'est-ce pas ?
Colonel Daniels ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait, putain ?
Je ne sais pas.
Ces gars n'ont pas peur.
Si on participe tous...
toi, moi, Sydnor...
on pourrait acheter
une caméra d'occasion.
J'ai pensé ą ēa.
Les numéros de série
ne seront pas les mźmes
que celle de la division
des enquźtes.
Il faut qu'on obtienne
des infos sur Marlo.
C'est la seule faēon.
Ce gamin, Randy, ne peut pas nous
balancer un meurtre, n'est-ce pas ?
Il ne peut mźme pas
nous donner un corps.
Mais il dit qu'un certain Kevin
était censé dire ą Lex
d'aller dans l'allée.
Qu'est-ce que ce p'tit con a dit
que le petit Kev a dit ?
"Lex est allé dans l'allée,
mais il est pas revenu".
Peut-źtre qu'il a tout vu.
Peut-źtre que c'est
notre témoin oculaire.
- Le petit Kevin ?
- Le petit Kevin.
Je retiens quatre.
80, 100, 10, 20.
420.
Oł est le reste ?
Euh... je suis posté
ą un endroit difficile.
C'est pas commode
sur Lafayette.
Mais qu'est-ce que tu fais
lą-bas, merde ?
Je dois faire ma clientčle.
Non, non, tu n'as pas
ą faire ēa, merde.
Ton pčre a fait cet endroit
et ils ont une dette envers toi
parce qu'ils ont
une dette envers lui.
Bodie a vraiment la mémoire courte
quand il s'agit d'źtre reconnaissant.
Maman !
Je vais éclaircir
cette connerie tout de suite.
Maman, laisse-moi faire.
Maman !
Chef.
Bill...
nous devons nous ressaisir.
J'ai une idée nouvelle
pour la nouvelle administration.
Cela ne me dérange pas
de vous dire
que je n'aime pas la faēon dont Carcetti
traīne dans notre boutique.
Il m'a parlé
plusieurs fois.
Vous prévoyez quelque chose, hein ?
Nous faisions une bonne équipe,
vous et moi.
En effet.
- Mlle Ella, oł est Bug ?
- Il est rentré chez vous, Michael.
Non, il doit m'attendre.
L'homme qui est venu le chercher
a dit qu'il était son pčre.
Et Bug a dit la mźme chose.
Merde !
Qu'est-ce que t'as fait, putain ?
Et pourquoi tu l'as laissé faire ēa ?
- Hé, écoute-moi...
- Non.
C'est comme ēa
que tu l'as chamboulé...
incapable de résoudre
ses propres meurtres.
Ton boulot est de passer du rouge
au noir, pas le contraire.
Et toi, défends-toi, putain.
Tu ne dois pas tout compter
sur les doigts, petit.
Regarde, compte d'abord...
six et six font...
12.
Pose le 2, retiens le 1.
- Bug.
- Hé, mon grand.
Viens ici tout de suite.
- On allait juste...
- Maintenant.
Yo, attends.
Yo, tu me dois 800 $.
Mais c'est un escargot,
vous savez,
et il fait...
il fait : "Miaou".
C'est un quoi ?
Quoi ?
Il miaule.
Et il s'étale
sur le ventre de Bob l'Éponge
comme si c'était
son animal.
Yo, vous regardez trop
de dessins animés, j'vous jure.
Voilà ce qui ne va pas
avec le système judiciaire.
Les négros sont enfermés
mais le restent pas.
C'est difficile de prendre
ces conneries au sérieux.
T'es devenu un indic
ou quoi ?
Sûrement pas, mec.
Ils m'ont donné
que quatre ans.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
J'ai fait 15 mois.
Alors, avec si peu,
je me dis : "Rien à foutre".
Merde.
Ouais, mec.
Alors...
Ouais, mec, c'est pas
comme c'était, mais ça va.
- Alors pour qui on deale ?
- Marlo Stanfield.
- Enfin, mec !
- Yo, mec, ouais.
Je recevais un joli paquet
de Slim Charles
mais Marlo a réussi
à nous coincer,
alors on en est là.
Merde, un boss est un boss.
Hé, yo, Petit Kev, je t'ai parlé
de Poot, pas vrai ?
Ouais.
Le baiseur.
Tu sors tout juste ?
- Combien de temps ?
- 15 mois.
T'as déjà baisé ?
Je crois que j'ai déjà chopé
la chtouille.
Vous devrez peut-être
m'emmener au dispensaire.
Je vois que rien
n'a changé dans ce trou.
Contre le mur, les gars.
Facilitez-nous les choses à tous.
Lequel de vous
est Petit Kevin ?
Allez, les gars.
C'est pas bien difficile.
On veut juste parler
avec ce salopard.
Tu t'appelles Kevin ?
Non, c'est, euh...
Poot.
Je m'appelle Poot, yo.
C'est ça. T'as pas été
emprisonné ou blessé ?
La société a dit que je mérite
une autre chance.
Ah oui ? Voyons. Lequel
de ces connards est le Petit Kevin ?
- Je ne connais pas de Kevin.
- J'emmerde la société.
Allez, Bodie. Je sais
qu'il travaille ici avec toi.
- Comment tu t'appelles ?
- J'ai l'air petit ?
Merde. Tous ceux de moins de 70 kgs
et 1,60m, dans la voiture.
Toi, toi et toi.
À moins que je vois des actes
de naissance prouvant le contraire,
vous êtes tous mes Petits Kevin.
On reviendra s'il le faut.
Compris ?
Quelle connerie, yo !
Tu as des papiers sur toi ?
Comme si je savais, putain.
Si ces policiers savaient
un peu y faire,
j'aurais les menottes.
Voyez ?
Ils ne savent rien du tout.
Nom de Dieu !
SUR ÉCOUTE
"On ferait aussi bien de les jeter
et d'en acheter des neuves".
Vous êtes mon conducteur ?
Je suis votre putain de sauveur,
voilà ce que je suis.
Je vous ai dit André mentait.
Je ne l'ai pas fait pour vous.
Le fait est que
si je pouvais reprendre
certaines affaires,
vous pourriez retourner
directement en prison.
Je sais.
- Alors, qui a tué la livreuse ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Je sais que ce n'était pas André
Il est pas aussi cruel.
D'où il reçoit son paquet ?
Je pourrais rentrer chez moi
et essayer
de trouver des choses pour vous...
- Tu me dois beaucoup, salaud.
- Je sais bien, mec.
Si tu veux payer ta dette,
tu sais quoi faire ?
Je ne veux plus voir de cadavres.
Pas un seul cadavre.
Plus de retour,
plus de vengeances.
Plus de tueries.
Donne-moi ta parole.
D'accord, mec.
Il n'y aura plus de cadavres.
Si vous voulez vraiment
me rassurer,
vous me laisserez vous conduire
à la gare d'Aberdeen
et vous mettre dans un train
vers le nord.
Non, mec.
Baltimore, c'est tout
ce que je connais.
Vous savez ce que c'est,
c'est chez moi.
Faut vivre chez soi, pas vrai ?
Vous avez absolument raison.
Il y a beaucoup de facteurs à considérer,
mais contrôler la criminalité,
c'est déterminant pour attirer
les investissements,
- relancer la croissance.
- Si c'est un endroit sûr, ils viendront.
Je regrette d'entamer
notre bonne relation en levant la main,
mais deux subventions fédérales
pour mon bureau seront supprimées.
Oui. Dès le 1er janvier,
les subventions
du Ministère de la Justice vont
disparaître, supprimant 12 procureurs.
J'espérais que vous puissiez
absorber ça dans les fonds généraux,
peut-être même
ajouter quelque chose,
rendre ça compétitif pour la police
et le bureau du procureur général...
lancer les changements.
Ça nous tue.
Ce serait le moment de le faire.
Nous dépassons les revenus
attendus à ce stade
de l'année fiscale
grâce au marché immobilier.
De combien ?Je veux faire
quelque chose d'exceptionnel
avec une augmentation des salaires,
en particulier celui du Chef de police,
qui a besoin d'augmenter
de 50 000 $ environ.
Un surplus de 20 millions
en une fois serait bien.
Mais c'est de l'argent pour
des urgences autres que la criminalité.
On dit à North Avenue
que les écoles sont en déficit.
Vous avez dit une augmentation
de 50 000 $ pour Ervin Burrell ?
Non, pas pour Burrell
personnellement.
Alors pour le prochain
Chef de police.
- C'est ça ?
- Ça semble logique.
Parce que renvoyer Burrell
contrarierait une bonne partie
de ma circonscription,
sans parler des pasteurs.
Et le chef du budget
aurait du mal
à faire approuver
un salaire plus important.
Je vous garantis que
si cette proposition figure au budget,
la première de votre part,
notons-le...
le texte ne sortira pas intact
de la commission.
Je dis juste que dans l'hypothèse
où le Burrell partirait,
nous voudrions
augmenter ce salaire
pour attirer les meilleurs candidats, en
particulier les candidats afro-américains
de tout le pays.
Avec trois ans restant à son mandat,
pourquoi voudrait-il partir ?
Monsieur, il n'est peut-être pas
évident pour vous
à la Commission
de la Sécurité publique,
que le processus budgétaire
est un ballet soigneusement orchestré,
un effort de coopération
entre les secteurs gouvernementaux.
Eh bien, Mme la Présidente,
les nuances de cet effort
de coopération
commencent à se préciser
pour moi.
Merci, Mme la Présidente.
Entrez !
Ne restez pas à la porte.
Duquan, mets-toi là.
Randy, mets-toi là.
Non, vous deux, échangez vos places.
Calvin, mets-toi devant.
Quenice, mets-toi là.
Michael, mets-toi là.
Destiny, là.
Myesha, là.
Dashonda, là.
Allez, avancez.
Ne restez pas à la porte.
Entrez.
Commençons.
Ça pourrait être un problème.
Comment ça ?
Ton gars a été transféré
- au service de la Criminelle.
- Ça veut dire ?
Les salopards qui ont organisé
les trois mises sur écoute...
celle où ils ont mis des micros
dans le bureau de Barksdale,
l'autre quand ils ont attrapé
Kentel à Park Heights.
Et la dernière... merde.
Ils ont écouté le portable
de Stringer Bell.
Tu n'utilises plus
de portables jetables, non ?
Je les jette
toutes les deux semaines.
C'est pas assez.
Lis ça.
Tu verras que Stringer changeait
de numéro tous les jours
et ils ont quand même reconnu
sa voix au central des portables.
La police de la ville a fait ça ?
Où est-ce que t'as eu ça ?
Au bureau du greffier
du tribunal.
Hé, ces conneries
sont disponibles au public
une fois le jugement passé.
Tu dois jeter tes portables, fiston.
Moi... j'en ai pas touché un
depuis un an.
170 cm ?
C'est ça.
Maintenant, garde la mesure
et étends tes bras sur le côté.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
J'en veux un.
Pour que ton chat le mange ?
Alors, comment tu les as trouvés ?
Je vais voir les calculatrices.
Donne-moi ça.
Donne-moi ça.
La même chose.
Ta taille et l'envergure
de tes bras... identiques.
Quenice ?
Tu vois, tu vas m'attirer
des ennuis.
Tu dis que tu aimes
faire de la boxe, c'est ça ?
Cette envergure doit t'aider.
Tout est bon marché sur les ordinateurs,
si on sait où chercher.
Yo, ça veut dire que le prix
que j'obtiens des Coréens,
yo, ils font encore
du bénéfice.
Ça doit être comme ça.
Je peux faire le double
en utilisant ça.
Non, non.
On ne peut pas.
Cette zone le long dans le sud
de la zone Patapsco/Westport
est prête pour un changement.
La proximité du centre-ville
et de B.W. Parkway
est idéal pour les gens qui travaillent
à Washington. C'est sûr.
- Qu'est-ce qui accélérerait ça ?
- Une esplanade le long du port
à l'ouest du pont.
L'Esplanade South Harbor
réalisée pour vous...
Par le Maire, Thomas Carcetti...
Et les citoyens de Baltimore.
Ça ne sonne pas aussi bien
qu'un stade ou l'agrandissement
d'un aquarium,
- n'est-ce pas ?
- C'est un début.
Plus à l'est, se trouve
le Locus Point Marine Terminal
qui, malheureusement,
est encore en activité,
et plus on va
vers Brooklyn/Curtis Bay,
plus la ligne d'horizon disparaît.
On perd les gens de Washington.
Par cette partie de la côte,
- il faudra une autre attraction.
- Des casinos ?
Ce qui manque à notre urbanisme ?
Je ne veux pas voir
le genre de criminalité
qu'ils apportent.
Les impôts sont les impôts.
C'est là que je quitte la barque.
C'est une chose de vendre
le front de mer pour les impôts,
mais là vous enlevez des emplois
à ma circonscription.
Ce n'était qu'une idée
et de toute façon,
nous allons trop vite.
Ce n'est que notre première réunion.
Merci à tout le monde.
Nous continuerons plus tard.
Mme la Présidente,
puis-je vous dire un mot ?
Vous avez un instant ?
Y'a déjà un problème
entre vous et moi ?
J'essaie seulement de vous guider
dans la procédure,
M. le... futur Maire.
J'avais plutôt l'impression d'être tiré
à travers un champ de mines, Nerese.
- Pourquoi êtes-vous si furax ?
- Écoutez
Clarence n'aurait pas dû
se représenter.
J'étais prête à le faire
et c'était convenu depuis longtemps
qu'il me soutiendrait, le moment venu.
Vous et Tony...
vous avez brûlé les étapes.
Ce n'était pas votre tour.
D'abord, désolé si Tony
et moi avons gâché vos projets,
mais je n'étais pas au courant
de vos manigances avec Clarence.
À part ça, je me réjouissais
de collaborer avec vous.
Je pense que nous pourrions
faire bouger les choses.
Vous n'aurez qu'un seul
mandat, Tommy.
Je ne renoncerai pas
la prochaine fois.
Qu'est-ce qui vous fait penser
que je resterai si longtemps ?
Les élections au poste de gouverneur sont
dans deux ans et les choses changent.
Vous pourriez vous retrouver
maire en 2008
sans même faire un discours
de campagne électorale.
Ça n'a pas été facile
de vous trouver.
Les numéros que j'ai pour vous
ne marchent plus.
Je vois que t'as un problème.
T'as pas bonne mine, Bubs.
Je suis clean,
vous savez,
je pousse mes chariots et tout ça.
Mais ce jeune homme...
chaque fois que je le rencontre,
il me pique
tout ce que j'ai sur moi.
L'argent, les pilules.
Il me considère comme un guichet
automatique, j'vous jure.
Je suis prêt à travailler, Kima.
Débarrassez-moi de ce salaud,
je ferai ce que vous voudrez.
Regarde-moi, Bubs.
Je ne suis pas dans les Stups.
Oui, je vois,
Vous avez bonne allure.
Je travaille aux Homicides.
Alors, si ce méchant gars me tuait,
vous pourriez m'aider, alors ?
Si on fait un tour en voiture,
tu penses pouvoir retrouver ce salaud ?
- Je peux essayer.
- Monte.
Alors, Nerese crée déjà
des problèmes ?
On dirait que si le fauteuil de maire ne
revient pas à Royce, il devrait être à elle.
Le problème, c'est qu'elle va voir toute
proposition d'augmenter le salaire du Chef
- comme une attaque contre Burrell.
- C'est le cas.
Si on n'augmente pas le salaire,
on ne peut pas attirer de bons candidats.
Sans candidats forts, on ne peut pas
se débarrasser du gars qu'on a.
Putain, je ne veux pas avoir Burrell
comme Chef de la Police.
Et s'il démissionnait ?
Démissionner ?
Il peut être blâmé.
S'il part de son propre chef,
ça élimine le problème
de Nerese et des pasteurs, non ?
Non. On ne veut pas savoir
votre numéro de carte de crédit.
Je veux dire,
on ne le saura même pas.
On a juste besoin
que vous commandiez les bonbons.
Et tu as de l'argent pour ça ?
Il vous remboursera, M. P.
Quand il les revendra,
- il vous remboursera.
- Oui.
Des bénéfices par paquet, hein ?
Pas question.
Allez, M. Pryzbo...
Ça ne nous apprend pas les maths ?
Les additions, les soustractions,
euh, un quart,
un quart de dollar,
10 centimes, un dixième, vous savez ?
Pas d'argent, pas de carte.
Bon, d'accord.
Je vous paierai d'avance.
Pas de problème.
Et si tu viens avec un paquet
de billets demain, Randy,
je voudrai savoir d'où ils viennent.
Je ne veux pas
que vous bossiez dans la rue.
D'accord.
Mlle Thiessen, ça va ?
Je crois que ma voiture
a été volée.
Ok, d'accord...
ce que je dis, c'est que tu as
de Bentlow jusqu'à Rosewood.
D'accord ?
Moi, j'ai le pâté de maisons
de Monroe jusqu'à Pacer,
donc je te couvre de ce côté
mais tu dois surveiller Franklintown
- pour repérer ceux qui viennent par là.
- D'accord, compris.
- Tu es prêt à travailler ?
- Oui, ravitaille-moi.
On vendra vraiment la came.
- Tu es prêt à travailler ?
- Oui, je suis prêt.
- Donut, va voir Petit Kevin.
- D'accord. Surveille la bagnole.
Hé, écoute. N'envoie pas
ta maman te défendre.
Je ne lui ai rien demandé.
Elle s'est juste énervée.
J'ai fait tout ce que je pouvais
pour toi et ta famille
mais à partir de maintenant,
ta mère ne peut rien faire, d'accord ?
Lui ?
De Wee-Bey ?
Ta mère ?
Pas de signe de ce connard André
Le magasin est cadenassé
depuis une semaine.
Il n'appelle même pas
pour se réapprovisionner.
Tu t'es renseigné
sur le gars à la prison ?
Ouais.
Les gars disent qu'Omar
est absent depuis deux semaines,
alors, soit il est quelque part,
soit ils l'ont transféré
à la prison régionale.
Ou alors, l'inculpation est retirée.
Si ce connard est sorti,
mon gars a changé
son histoire.
Il pourrait tous vous larguer.
Je m'en occupe.
Et les gars de New York ?
On en a descendu cinq.
Les autres ont disparu.
Dans le quartier est,
on ne voit même pas un négro
avec une casquette des Yankee.
Tu veux qu'on continue ?
J'ai parlé au gros,
je crois pas qu'on a fini.
Cette merde avec André...
c'est la priorité.
Non. On pourrait essayer
l'avenue encore une fois.
Il est parfois derrière
le magasin.
Bubs, j'ai pas
toute la journée.
Je dois prendre mon service.
Je travaille sur les meurtres.
Il m'a piqué mon fric
quatre fois cette semaine, Kima.
Je rêve de ce minable.
Bon, écoute...
tu veux travailler ?
Je vais appeler Sydnor ou Herc
à la Criminelle
pour qu'ils te mettent
avec quelqu'un des Stups.
Si tu travailles pour eux,
ils t'aideront. D'accord ?
- J'en ai besoin maintenant, Kima.
- Je leur dirai.
Madame...
Montre-moi où t'habites
et je leur dirai où ils peuvent tu trouver.
Tournez à gauche.
Je ne comprends pas.
Tu as dit au mec
que tu ne tueras personne.
J'ai donné ma parole.
Alors qu'est-ce qu'on fait là, Papa ?
Je peux quand même pointer
un flingue sur la tronche André, non ?
Ce mec a dit des explications
à donner.
C'est mort par ici, yo.
Démarre.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi
il nous fait pas confiance.
On est fiables, non ?
Il faut juste en acheter assez
à la première commande.
Oui !
Un six !
Allez, trois !
Je joue.
Va-t'en, gamin.
- Oh, tu joues ?
- Ouais.
Je parie sur les dés, yo.
Oh, merde !
Ouais. Prends l'argent.
Prends l'argent, petit.
Prends l'argent.
J'en ai entendu parler
mais je ne le croyais pas.
Toutes ces heures supplémentaires,
tout ça pour deux affaires comme adjointe.
D'abord les noms
sont en rouge, puis en vert
et puis en noir.
Et cela n'inclut pas le chèque du tribunal
que tu auras si le cas passe en justice.
Sympa.
Qu'est-ce que vous allez
faire avec ça, Inspecteur Greggs ?
Rembourser des dettes.
- Pourquoi tu pars ?
- Ta chance va pas tourner.
Ne t'inquiète pas
pour ça, mec.
Merci de nous accompagner.
Je croyais qu'on allait
se faire voler.
Tu vas pas nous voler,
n'est-ce pas ?
Merde, mec.
Tu crois que je suis si ingrat ?
Je t'ai suivi sur 10 coups
et j'ai gagné plus d'argent
qu'en un mois.
Non. Je vais pas vous voler.
J'ai juste besoin de savoir
comment tu joues, tu comprends ?
C'est une question de maths,
les probabilités et tout ça.
Je t'ai jamais vu jouer.
Où tu as appris à jouer ?
- Au collège Edward Tilgman.
- Merde.
Tout ce qu'on a,
c'est Petit Kevin.
Oh, le gars de Bodie, hein ?
Qu'est-ce que je vous avais dit ?
Bubs comprend du premier coup.
Venez tous me retrouver
demain après-midi...
après la sortie de l'école... et je donnerai
un nouveau chapeau à Kevin.
Un chapeau ?
Cool.
Yo, Herc ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
C'est pas pour l'argent, cette fois.
Il me tabasse
si je ne lui donne pas quelque chose.
Je... je n'en peux plus.
Quand on en aura fini
avec Kevin,
vous irez chercher ce salopard
et m'appellerez sur mon portable.
Je le choperai dans les cinq minutes.
Je vous le promets.
Et puis tu ajoutes ça, yo,
et ça fait des bulles.
Pas autant.
Pas autant.
Ça va couler partout.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais encore là ?
Personne veut de toi ici.
Ta maman veut de moi.
Oui. Toi et ta drogue.
- Tu devrais pas dire ça de ta mère.
- Papa, tu vois mon volcan ?
Bug, monte.
Bug a besoin de moi aussi.
Samedi, n'est-ce pas ?
Bug a besoin de moi.
Mes profs disent que
j'ai besoin de lunettes.
Je dois avoir un adulte
avec moi.
Pour aller les chercher et signer.
Bug, monte dans ta chambre.
T'es d'une froideur, fiston.
Qu'est-ce qui t'est arrivé ?
Ton âme ne sait pas pardonner.
Va te faire foutre !
Attention à ce que tu dis !
Tu es grand mais pas assez grand.
Alors...
où est la carte des allocations ?
Ta maman a dit
qu'elle est pour moi.
Il ne reste rien du chèque
de ce mois-ci de toute façon.
Avant le 1er du mois, alors.
Euh, entre.
Je vois que le petit
a envahi le salon.
Tant mieux pour lui.
Tu sais comment c'est.
Je plaisante.
L'appartement est joli.
Même les jouets
font bon effet.
C'est...
Ce mois et les deux précédents.
J'essaie de rattraper le retard.
J'apprécie que tu ne m'aies pas harcelée.
Tu fais des hold-up ou quoi ?
Des heures sup aux Homicides.
Si ça continue comme ça,
je n'aurai pas de problème
à payer ma part.
Kima...
Ça ne veut pas dire :
"S'il te plaît, reprends-moi",
mais il faut respecter
ses engagements, n'est-ce pas ?
Hé, je suis là.
Hé, Elijah.
Euh, Kima, voici Nancine Owens.
Désolée pour le désordre.
Tu pourrais rester dîner
mais ce soir on a des invités.
On célèbre quelque chose, en fait.
Ah oui ?
- J'ai passé le barreau cette semaine.
- Félicitations.
La plupart des filles avec qui je travaille
ont du mal avec ça.
- Avec quoi ?
- Passer le barreau.
Je ferais bien de partir.
Merci d'être passée.
- On va faire un lit...
- Oui.
Ravie de vous avoir rencontrée.
- Elijah ?
- Hein ?
Dis au revoir à Tante Kima.
Au revoir.
- Où est Dre ?
- Je sais pas !
- Tu la crois ?
- Non.
Pour la dernière fois.
Où est André ?
Il a dit que s'il me disait
où il allait,
je devrais te le dire.
Je ne sais pas.
Je ne sais pas.
Tu la crois maintenant ?
Ouais.
Mince. C'est bien calme
si tôt le matin.
Yo, tu viens avec moi
voir M. P ?
Non, monte.
Je te retrouverai en classe.
D'accord.
M. P.
Randy.
Randy, comment as-tu...
Un six l'emporte sur un quatre
ou un cinq.
Et la plupart du temps, huit
est mieux que 10. C'est ça ?
Vous m'avez bien éduqué.
- Tu as parié ?
- Sans même toucher aux dés.
J'ai seulement dit :
"Passera, passera pas".
Au point que certains
d'entre eux me suivaient.
- Tu ne devrais pas parier.
- Je sais, mais les maths, ça marche.
Je reviendrai au déjeuner et on pourra
commander les bonbons, d'accord ?
Démissionner ?
C'est ça ou la gestion quotidienne
du département
reviendra au Chef Adjoint.
Erv, je n'ai pas caché
que je voulais faire des changements.
Alors Bill Rawls est maintenant
le porte-parole des réformes ?
Il ne s'agit pas de Rawls.
Je n'ai pas confiance en vous,
du fait des événements récents.
Je me souviens qu'on était assis
dans le même box
il y a un an
et vous m'avez dit
à quel point vous respectez
la hiérarchie.
Eh bien, respectez-la maintenant.
Chaque chef de département
est au service du maire.
Alors, si vous me renvoyez,
M. le Maire,
sachez que je partirai
sans faire de bruit.
Vous me donnerez
votre lettre de démission ?
Oh, non.
Je ne propose pas
de démissionner.
Si vous voulez que je parte,
vous devrez me foutre à la porte.
C'est une petite différence, mais...
entre temps,
puisque vous faites faire
mon travail à Bill Rawls,
et qu'il fait si beau aujourd'hui,
je pense que je vais aller
à Forest Park et jouer au golf.
L'addition est pour vous.
Choisissez une table,
n'importe laquelle.
Tour Eiffel, Big Ben,
Empire State Building.
Votre table est votre équipe.
L'équipe qui monte sa maquette
en premier gagne.
Vous dites que vous travaillez
ensemble dans la rue.
Voyons comment vous
vous débrouillez avec ça.
On gagne quoi ?
De grosses étoiles en or.
Dîner au centre-ville
dans le restaurant de votre choix.
Comme vous semblez ne vouloir
vous intéresser qu'à des trucs
que vous connaissez,
on a cherché des choses
ressemblant à Baltimore.
Les maquettes de la planque
sur Fayette Street
étaient toutes vendues.
Alors, vous allez devoir
vous contenter de ça.
Hé, M. Colvin, la boîte
dit qu'il y a un mode d'emploi.
On les a enlevés. C'est plus intéressant,
vous ne trouvez pas ?
C'est pas qu'on suive un mode
d'emploi autre part, non ?
Je ne veux plus
accuser personne.
Mais, ils m'ont forcé,
et maintenant ils vont être en colère
contre moi parce que ça colle pas.
Qui c'est "ils" ?
Les gens qui me filent
le paquet.
Je te demande qui.
Le gars s'appelle Marlo.
Il est fort dans le quartier ouest.
Tu en as entendu parler ?
Je me rappelle vaguement du nom.
Alors, je dois juste rester tranquille
un moment jusqu'à ce qu'ils oublient.
Alors, maintenant tu viens
dans le quartier est
et tu voudrais que je te cache.
Pourquoi chaque négro
de Baltimore pense
que se cacher
signifie traverser le centre-ville ?
Tu devrais être à New York
ou Philadelphie, ou autre part.
Je sais, mais je connais personne
en dehors de Baltimore.
J'espérais qu'en échange
de ma boutique, tu pourrais peut-être
m'avancer du fric et me faire
quitter la ville avec des potes à toi.
Je viendrais dans le quartier est
avec toi,
mais trop de salopards du quartier est
sont avec Marlo.
Tu sais quel est le problème
avec ces machines ?
Elles sont trop bon marché
au départ.
On pourrait penser que,
pour le prix que ça coûte
de réparer ces saloperies,
on ferait aussi bien de les jeter
et d'en acheter des neuves.
2 000 et je te dépose vers le nord
pour la boutique et son contenu.
La boutique vaut beaucoup plus, Joe.
Ça dépend, n'est-ce pas ?
Non, ça va de l'autre côté.
Arrête de foutre ça devant moi.
Je veux faire quelque chose.
Si tu m'insultes encore,
je vais te faire mal.
Enlève cette merde
de devant ma figure.
Je ne veux même plus
faire ces conneries.
Tu fais toujours ça.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Regarde la boîte.
Ça ressemble à ce
qui est sur la boîte ?
Je ne peux pas faire ça.
Enfin, négro !
J'essaie de manger.
- Donne-moi ce morceau, yo.
- Va te faire foutre, yo,
tu sais même pas
ce que tu fais.
Reste là et ferme-la,
tu sais pas ce que tu fais.
Viens ici et fais-moi taire, alors.
Yo, tu commences à m'emmerder.
Tu sais pas ce que tu fais.
Tu es trop con.
Hé, Z, fais le haut
pendant que je fais le milieu.
Darnell, tu fais le bas, hein ?
Ouais, ouais.
Comme ça. Comme ça.
Merde !
- Fini.
- N'importe quoi, putain !
Il triche, yo.
Vas-y, touche-la, chérie.
Cette merde est faite pour durer.
Et les pièces en plus ?
Quelles pièces en plus ?
Qu'est-ce que tu as
dans la poche ?
Il n'y a rien dans ma poche.
Alors, qui sait faire
un bon steak par ici ?
D'accord.
Primo... À partir du jour
de mon investiture,
le Chef Burrell ne devra prendre aucune
initiative sans votre accord.
Les responsabilités administratives
de routine
incomberont au bureau de l'Adjoint
si ce n'est pas encore le cas.
Ça me plaît.
Pas de problème.
Secondo...
Je veux faire monter Stan Valchek.
Un bon gars, Valchek.
C'est un salaud, mais
j'ai une dette envers lui.
Si je le nomme Adjoint de l'Administration,
il peut vraiment faire des dégâts ?
Je le surveillerai.
Pas de problème.
Tertio... Je fais passer Daniels colonel
et je lui donne les Enquêtes criminelles
et carte blanche pour mettre de l'ordre.
- Cedric Daniels ?
- Un problème ?
Non, c'est un bon policier.
Il a juste...
une tendance à être indépendant.
Indépendant par rapport à qui ?
Je n'ai pas de problème
à promouvoir Daniels.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il vous faut d'autre ?
- C'est tout pour l'instant.
M. le Maire, à propos d'Ervin...
si ça ne vous dérange pas,
pourquoi le garder comme marionnette
alors que vous pouvez le renvoyer ?
Ça nous dérange
que vous demandiez.
Les cerises, ça me branche
à moitié.
Yo, Dukie.
T'as déjà dénoncé ta mère
au Service Social ?
Quoi ?
Je sais pas. Je veux juste savoir
ce qui se passe
si on dénonce quelqu'un
au Service Social.
Tu veux dénoncer ta mère ?
Il a amené un mec à la maison
et il ne veut pas partir.
Tu devrais pas appeler
le Service Social.
Ils mettent leur nez
dans tes affaires
et ils pourraient te mettre
dans un foyer,
même vous séparer,
Bug et toi.
Mais je veux pas qu'on parte.
Je veux que lui, il parte.
Tu parles du père de Bug,
c'est ça ?
Tu devrais peut-être parler
de ça à un prof.
M. Pryzbo sait vraiment
prendre les choses.
M. P. a dit que je pouvais parler
à l'assistant social de l'école.
C'est un alcoolique.
Oh, et le gars du club de boxe,
M. Cutty ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il a, Cutty ?
Je sais pas.
Il est trop gentil.
Ça me fait flipper.
C'est une pédale.
Non, pas Cutty, mec.
Il est branché sur les femmes.
Yo, t'as pas vu comment il fait ?
Ça veut rien dire.
Les pédés font comme ça aussi.
Je sais pas.
Il est seulement trop gentil.
Tout le monde est trop gentil, putain.
Pas question.
Alors, son nom est...
comment tu l'appelles ?
C'est une blague.
Ouais. Ils l'ont inversé.
- Bande de clowns, putain.
- Mm-hm.
L'an dernier, les tests ont donné
des résultats médiocres.
Et ne pensez pas
qu'ils ne l'ont pas remarqué
au Palais de la Question
Sans Réponse.
Ils attendent
une amélioration de 10 points
de tous les collèges cette fois-ci.
L'examen est dans six semaines
et vous voulez qu'on y prépare
les élèves maintenant ?
Cette année, le terme favori
est "Respect du programme".
Il n'y a pas de mal
à mettre l'accent
sur les compétences nécessaires
pour l'examen.
Si on arrive à leur faire écrire
un paragraphe sans insultes dedans,
les notes ne pourront qu'augmenter.
Les compétences, c'est une chose,
mais cela nous fait enseigner
les questions directement.
Les questions demandent
des compétences.
- Que voulez-vous dire ?
- Mieux vaut ne pas comprendre.
Vous vous attendiez vraiment
que ça diffère de l'an dernier ?
Il n'y a rien au sujet des maths.
Ces questions portent sur l'anglais.
Notre pires résultats
aux examens l'an dernier.
Pour le moment,
tous les professeurs
passeront du temps en classe
à enseigner les questions-type
d'anglais.
Prenez la page 11, s'il vous plaît,
il y a des choses
que je veux voir avec vous.
Je ne comprends pas.
Tout cela pour améliorer
nos résultats à l'examen de l'état ?
Si on enseigne aux enfants
les questions de l'examen,
qu'est-ce que
ça veut dire pour eux ?
Rien. Ça veut dire
quelque chose pour nous.
Si les résultats sont meilleurs,
ils peuvent dire
que les écoles s'améliorent.
Si les résultats restent mauvais,
ils ne peuvent pas.
- Trafiquer les statistiques.
- Pardon ?
Changer les vols
en délits mineurs,
faire disparaître les viols...
On trafique les statistiques
et les gros bonnets sont promus.
Je connais la routine.
Où qu'on aille, c'est comme ça.
Raven a Mike Anderson.
Jamal et lui iront...
Regarde ces petits cons.
On ira quand le ballon sera en l'air
pendant une passe longue.
- Doucement ?
- Oui.
Vas-y, une longue.
Vas-y.
Lance-la haut.
Vas-y.
- Les Stups !
- Oh, merde !
Les flics, yo ! Les flics !
- Où tu vas ?
- Lâche-moi, salope !
Ils sont dans les allées.
Si on retourne là-dedans,
on peut les poursuivre.
Pas besoin.
Je les connais tous.
- Laisse-moi, salopard !
- Et celui-là ?
C'est même pas un appât.
On le relâche... à moins que tu veuilles
passer la moitié de la journée
- au bureau des arrestations de bébés.
- Moi ?
J'ai pas peur, salopard !
Je ne veux pas passer ma journée
au Contrôle des Preuves.
- Alors pourquoi t'as fait ça ?
- Pour que je puisse leur parler.
J'aime penser que jusqu'au moment
où les menottes sont à leur taille,
on peut encore leur parler.
Viens là.
Allons faire un tour.
Ta gueule.
Yo, c'est quoi, cette musique ?
Miss Lady Day,
Billie Holiday.
Oui, elle chante bien.
Vraiment triste.
Oui. Je suis comme ça.
On croit que je suis ghetto
et puis je change
et tu sais plus où t'en est.
La prochaine fois
qu'on fera ça, M. Colvin,
pourriez-vous
faire ça le week-end ?
Je n'ai eu que trois heures
entre l'école et maintenant
pour me préparer.
Tu es belle, Zenobia.
Je pourrais être encore mieux.
Combien de temps pensez-vous
que ça prend pour me coiffer ?
Je commanderai le plus gros
hamburger. Des frites, aussi.
Négro, c'est pas MacDo !
Commande plutôt
une côte de bœuf saignante.
Avec le sang qui dégouline ?
Non, ce n'est pas du sang.
Alors, qu'est-ce que c'est "saignant" ?
Ça veut dire à peine cuit ?
Saignant.
- Enlève le sang, imbécile.
- Tu vois ?
Et à point,
garde le sang dedans.
Je veux seulement
savoir la différence,
avant de commander
un truc pas cuit.
- Hé, M. Colvin.
- Hein ?
Comment ça marche ?
Écoutez, on demandera
au serveur. D'accord ?
Oh, merde.
Il y a un serveur ?
C'est juste au bout de la rue.
Où elle est, imbécile ?
Je ne l'ai pas vue.
Elle a une dette envers moi.
Toute cette came que je lui donnée.
Oui, je sais.
Je sais pas.
Comment ça, tu ne sais pas ?
Je sais pas.
Si je la trouve,
je lui coupe le nichon.
Tu vas voir.
Tu as quelque chose à dire, négro ?
Non, non.
Yo, où est Herc ?
J'ai trouvé le connard,
d'accord ?
Dites-lui que je suis
sur Riggs et Calhoun.
Il sait. Il sait.
D'accord.
Reviens ici, putain.
Négro, je vais te péter
la gueule.
Tu ne connais pas Lex ?
Je connaissais Bull.
Enfin, je le connais.
Mais il n'est plus là.
Tu vois ? T'as merdé.
T'as dit : "Je connaissais",
comme si tu savais qu'il était mort.
Non. Vous me faites dire
des choses.
Je voulais dire :
"Je le connaissais".
Quand il était là,
je le connaissais, mais il est parti.
Herc.
Bubbles a appelé.
Il a vu le gars...
le salopard.
Il est au croisement de Riggs et Calhoun.
Il le retient cinq minutes,
le temps que tu traverses la ville.
Je suis au milieu
d'un entretien.
C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
Dis-lui qu'on règlera
son problème demain.
D'accord ?
Oh, le connard.
Il a pas de téléphone.
Tu m'as menti dehors.
Pourquoi je devrais te croire
maintenant ?
Tu étais là
quand Lex a été tué.
Tu fais partie du putain
de coup monté.
On le sait par un témoin
qui t'a reconnu.
Oui, on le sait.
Tu sais où est ce corps.
Tu étais là avec Snoop,
Chris et d'autres peut-être.
Tu sais comment faire marcher
un interrogatoire ?
Avec un peu d'influence.
On n'a pas d'influence ?
Connard, on a même
pas de corps.
Lex n'est rien d'autre
qu'un nom.
Où est-ce que tu crois aller, putain ?
Tu n'iras nulle part.
Home Depot est là !
Home Depot !
Qu'est-ce que tu as
pour moi ce soir ?
Je t'ai cherché
toute la journée.
Non, non. C'est fini,
cette histoire. C'est fini.
Qu'est-ce que tu dis ? Ne plaisante pas,
j'ai pas le temps.
Tu n'auras que de la merde,
compris ?
Tu peux me lécher le cul,
tout le mal que tu m'as donné.
Qu'est-ce que tu cherches, hein ?
C'est pas là.
C'est sur moi, compris ?
C'est sur toi ?
Oui.
- C'est sur toi ?
- Attends, attends, attends !
Oh, non, non, non !
Laisse-moi !
Laisse-moi !
Allez ! Laisse-moi !
Hé, attends, attends, attends !
Prends-le !
Prends-le !
- Je te tiens !
- Non, non, non !
C'est comme ça, hein ?
J'aime pas ceux
qui sont orange.
Écoute-moi, connard.
On sait que tu étais là.
Tu lui as tendu un piège
et tu ne l'as pas fait tout seul.
Qu'est-ce que vous dites ?
Tu n'étais pas seul.
On le sait.
Vous voulez dire Randy ?
C'est moi qui pose les questions,
compris ?
Si tu ne nous donnes pas
ce meurtre, Kevin,
quelqu'un d'autre le fera.
Et alors, ils te mettront en taule.
Tu m'entends?
Colvin. Une table pour quatre.
Je vais vérifier
que votre table est prête.
"Colvin. Une table
pour quatre", hein ?
Bonsoir. Puis-je prendre
votre manteau ?
Bien sûr.
Vous, Monsieur ?
Oh, non. Ça va.
Oui. Moi aussi.
Bien, votre table est prête.
Suivez-moi, s'il vous plait.
Monsieur ?
- C'est votre chaise, c'est ça ?
- Non.
Assieds-toi là.
La serveuse va venir
vous donner le détail
des plats du jour.
Bonne soirée.
Merci.
La serveuse ?
Qui c'était, elle ?
C'est l'hôtesse.
Ne vous inquiétez pas, M. C.
Je prendrai rien de cher.
Je prendrai un plat du jour.
C'est pas les soldes du jour,
imbécile.
"Du jour" veut dire qu'ils cuisinent
quelque chose de différent.
Yo, et toi alors, qui bois
sans paille,
toute ghetto et tout ?
On ne boit pas l'eau
avec une paille.
Et mets ça sur tes genoux,
imbécile.
Tu vois quelqu'un d'autre ici
qui a l'air de Fred Flinstone ?
Chut ! La ferme.
Les gens vont nous regarder.
Bonsoir. Je m'appelle Pam.
Je voudrais vous parler
des plats du jour.
Nous avons du saumon
avec du maïs doux,
des chanterelles
et de l'aïoli au basilic ;
du poulet chasseur sauté
avec de la purée de pommes de terre ;
du crabe de Chesapeake Bay,
ail braisé, crème d'échalotes
et champignons ;
et une caille braisée
au feu de bois
avec une salade au pain grillé.
Mince, je pensais
que vous aviez des steaks.
Oui, nous en avons,
sur la seconde page des menus.
Puis-je prendre
vos commandes de boissons ?
Oui. Nous prendrons quatre cocas,
s'il vous plait.
- Tout de suite.
- Merci.
Ça ne te dérange pas
si je viens demain ?
Me déranger ?
Je...
Ça ne te gênerait pas ?
Non, pas du tout.
Je veux dire...
Je serais fier
que tu sois là.
C'est drôle
comme les choses arrivent.
Toutes ces années, j'ai essayé
de gravir les échelons,
en me faisant bien voir,
en me couvrant, en obéissant.
Finalement, je leur dis
ce que je pense vraiment,
et je passe de lieutenant
à colonel en un peu plus d'un an.
Et toi, tu es inquiète
pour ces assignations
et inquiète que Lester
te surmène avec ton patron...
Mais les assignations
me font monter en grade.
Je sais.
Tu sais, Marlo m'a dit une fois :
"On ne peut pas perdre,
si on ne joue pas".
Et nous y voilà.
Peut-être que c'est en train
de changer.
Quoi ?
La ville, la façon dont les choses
marchent ou pas.
Peut-être que c'est un tournant
et que les choses ne seront plus
aussi pourries.
À la santé de Carcetti.
Et à la nôtre.
Zenobia, tu veux prendre une photo
du restaurant, n'est-ce pas ?
- C'est pas grave, il est tard.
- Non, non. C'est bon.
- Allez, donne-moi l'appareil.
- C'est bon.
Allez, donne-moi l'appareil.
D'accord.
Vous voulez pas être
sur la photo ?
Yo, M. C, on peut
s'arrêter chez McDonald's ?
- Mais qu'est-ce que t'as ?
- La nourriture n'était pas bonne.
J'aime pas le poisson.
Pourquoi tu en as commandé, alors ?
Yo, ta gueule.
- Baisse le son.
- Quoi ?
Baisse le son, Namond.
Monte le son ?
D'accord, voilà.
Sérieusement, on peut au moins
acheter des frites?
Tu es pathétique.
C'est pas parce que t'es une fille
que je te casserai pas la gueule.
Tu m'entends ?
S'il te plaît, négro !
Ouais, tu continues à dire
des conneries.
Non, c'est toi.
- T'as dû oublier.
- Non, j'oublie rien.
- Oublié quoi ?
- Que c'est moi, l'homme.
Bon.
Alors, quelle est la première chose
qu'on fait
en répondant à une question ?
Randy ?
"D'après le texte... ?"
"D'après le texte".
C'est bien.
Et comment on termine
la réponse ? Quenice ?
- Hein ?
- Allez !
Je sais que tu sais ça.
"Les faits mentionnés ci-dessus
m'amènent à conclure que..."
Non ? Bon.
Essayons de lire
le troisième paragraphe.
Je vais commencer.
"Pythias implore une dernière fois
le tyran Dionysius
de le laisser rentrer chez lui
une dernière..." Calvin, continue.
"De le laisser rentrer chez lui
une dernière fois
avant de subir sa punition.
Il refuse cette demande
jusqu'à ce que Damon inter..."
"Intercède...
...et offre sa propre vie
jusqu'au retour de Pythias".
Bien.
Qui veut deviner ce que
"intercède" signifie ?
Et "implorer" ?
Bon.
Et l'histoire, alors ?
Comment la résumeriez-vous ?
Duquan, essaie.
"D'après le texte..."
Tout le monde est
sauvé à la fin, non ?
Bon.
Réfléchissons à ça.
"D'après le texte,
Damon offre sa propre vie
pour celle de Pythias
pour que celui-ci puisse
rentrer chez lui une dernière fois.
Les faits mentionnés ci-dessus
m'amènent à conclure
que Damon accorde de la valeur
à l'amitié et la loyauté de Pythias".
Des questions ?
On en veut quatre de la pure.
275 000 là.
Pour quatre, ça devrait être 300 000.
Je déduis 5 000 pour chaque mec
de New York. C'est le prix.
Tu veux encore
qu'on s'en occupe ?
Non, on dirait qu'ils ont compris
et ont foutu le camp.
C'est vrai.
Delroy a récupéré tous les coins
de Monument Street.
D'accord. Appelle-nous
quand le prochain paquet arrivera.
Tu te rappelles quand je t'ai parlé
que dans la coopération,
on est tous ensemble,
on se soutient
quand on peut ?
Tu te souviens de ça ?
Le prix pour quatre paquets de pure,
c'est 300 000.
Et ton boulot sur ces gars
de New York
a déjà été pris en compte
dans ce prix.
D'autre part,
on a quelque chose que tu veux
et qui te reviendra... gratuitement.
Quelqu'un que tu cherches.
Coop signifie coopérer,
mon ami.
Tu es content de m'aider,
je suis content de t'aider.
Félicitations, Colonel.
Félicitations, Chef-adjoint.
Félicitations à tous ceux
qui ont été promus,
leurs familles et amis.
C'est un jour de fierté
pour eux
et pour le Département
de police de Baltimore.
Je suis si fière de toi.
Oh, merci.
Pour Valchek,
on aurait pu deviner.
Il est dans la bande
de Carcetti, mais...
Daniels ?
Ça vous a pris du temps pour devenir
commandant mais ça, c'était rapide.
Oui, qui est
votre nouveau rabbin, hein ?
Colonel.
Ils ne savaient différencier
la fourchette à salade
de l'autre fourchette à je ne sais quoi.
Et alors ?
Je savais qu'ils seraient perdus,
mais à ce point...
Je parle de sentiments...
pourquoi ils sombrent
après s'être sentis les maîtres
de l'univers dans la peur abjecte,
la furie de l'humiliation
sans en être conscients.
Qui dit
qu'ils n'en sont pas conscients ?
Peut-être qu'ils ne l'ont
simplement pas admis.
C'est possible. Mais ma question
est où commencer avec eux ?
Comment leur donner
confiance en eux
s'ils ne peuvent même pas
admettre leurs sentiments
sur leur identité et ce qu'ils font
dans ce monde ?
Ce ne sont pas des imbéciles.
Ils savent exactement
ce que nous attendons d'eux.
Vous avez tous manqué
un sacré repas, vraiment.
Asseyez-vous.
C'était super, yo.
"Une table pour quatre,
M. Colvin".
"Puis-je prendre votre manteau,
M. Brice ?"
Ha ! C'était la classe.
Je rêve du gâteau au chocolat.
Oh mon Dieu !
Il avait 36 couches, yo !
"D Money sauve Pitman" ?
C'est de la connerie !
Avant, au moins, ils en retiraient
quelque chose.
Au diable, mon évaluation.
Au diable, Donnelly,
au diable les notes
d'examen !
Je suis venu ici
pour enseigner.
N'est-ce pas ?
Yo, entraîneur,
vous avez vu Michael ?
- Non.
- Bon.
C'était pas toi
et tes petits copains
que j'ai vus hier sur Bentlow,
vendre de la came ?
C'est bon.
Parce qu'un gangster
comme toi
ne monterait pas
une boutique si nulle
sans mecs qui montent la garde,
avec le stock visible.
Je vous le dis aussi clairement
que je peux.
C'était votre unique chance,
les gars.
Si je vous y reprends,
vous prendrez tous une raclée
et irez à Cheltenham.
Vous êtes prévenus.
Cheltenham,
pour possession de drogue ?
S'il vous plaît...
Je marquerai
que tu es un dur.
Ne pense pas
que je ne le ferai pas.
Tape, tape ! Bien.
Il croit pas que je peux
aller en prison ?
Merde !
Je peux aller en prison...
- Quoi de neuf ?
- Namond fait des conneries ?
Oui. C'est un de vos poulains,
c'est ça ?
Il venait à la salle de boxe,
surtout quand il attendait
le petit Michael.
Il ne fait pas de boxe, ni rien.
C'est pas vraiment le genre.
Pas comme son père.
- C'est qui son père ?
- Un mec qui s'appelle Wee-Bey.
Une tête dure. Il était
dans la bande de Barksdale.
Je le connais.
Je l'ai arrêté à Philadelphie.
Ah oui ?
Bey était mon copain.
On était en taule à Jessup.
Enfin, Namond est son fils.
Le même sang,
mais pas le même cœur.
J'ai fini mon échauffement.
Ouais. On est prêts
pour le ring !
À plus.
Pourquoi on s'arrête ici ?
Je croyais qu'on allait tout droit.
Tu dois retrouver ton escorte.
Prop Joe a dit que tu étais
mon escorte.
C'est une façon de parler
qui peut être vraie.
Viens par ici, mec.
Allez.
Chris, non !
Tu sais que je ferai vite, Dre.
- Ici ?
- Ici c'est bien.
Pas sur un terrain vague.
Quelle différence ça fait ?
La différence, c'est ma famille.
- Ils ne sauront pas.
- Ils sauront.
Mais... mais... mais les rats.
Je serai seul avec les rats.
T'inquiète pas.
Je vais m'occuper de toi.
Voyons, Chris.
Laisse-moi faire ça chez moi
pour que ma famille...
ils puissent m'enterrer.
Nom de Dieu !
Hé, yo, ça doit être Marlo, mec.
Tu vois ?
C'est le mec qu'on a volé, yo,
au jeu de poker.
Pas étonnant
qu'il m'aime pas.
Je pensais que je pourrais
parler à Chris.
J'ai un problème que je peux
dire à personne d'autre.
C'est qu'un gosse.
J'hallucine !
Oh, merde !
Dťgage de la route !
- Il roule comme un fou.
- Merde !
16. J'ai une poursuite
ŗ pied d'un individu noir.
13 ans environ, petit,
avec des nattes,
dans les allťes
ŗ l'est de Fulton.
Le gosse s'est ťchappť !
Putain de merde !
Merde ! merde !
Officier, qu'est-ce
que vous faites ?
Il vous faut
des lunettes ou quoi ?
Quoi ?
16, 200 nord.
Il va me falloir votre nom.
Je suis vraiment dťsolť,
Madame.
Donne-moi la casquette.
Les Expťditions
sont dures ŗ conduire.
Mais avec une Lexus,
j'aurais pas eu de problŤme.
Petit connard.
- Toutes ces voitures que t'as abÓmťes !
- Quoi ?
N'essaie mÍme pas
de me sortir ton baratin.
Je sais pas de quoi
vous parlez.
Tu sais toutes les paperasses
que je devrai faire,
combien d'heures
de ma vie tu me dois, p'tit con ?
Merde ! «a fait mal !
Tu crois que Áa fait mal...
Non, non.
Si tu es si malin,
voyons comment tu piqueras
une bagnole maintenant.
SUR …COUTE
"Le monde va dans un sens,
les gens de l'autre".
Vous imaginez Rawls
dans ce fauteuil ?
Jamais.
Dans cette ville ? Non, non.
On n'ťtait pas censťs
avoir un maire blanc non plus.
Il a dťjŗ exagťrť en donnant
le pouvoir ŗ Rawls.
De fait, merde.
Le salopard n'est mÍme pas
encore en place.
Il a dťjŗ des antennes partout.
Je sais qu'il a appelť
le chef adjoint ŗ Pittsburgh...
Un ami ŗ moi...
et lui a promis
monts et merveilles.
Merde, mon ami.
Vous devez seulement montrer
ŗ Carcetti et aux autres
qu'ils ont dťjŗ l'homme idťal
pour ce poste.
Ils ne regarderont pas plus loin.
L'homme indispensable.
C'est Royce qui vous retenait, Ervin.
Et tout d'un coup,
vous vous rťvťlez.
Clay, il dit que tout passe
par Bill Rawls.
Tout ce que j'essaie
d'entreprendre...
Vous Ítes encore le chef,
n'est-ce pas ?
Vous donnez un ordre,
ils l'exťcutent.
- Oui, mais Carcetti...
- Qu'est-ce qu'il va faire ? Vous renvoyer ?
Il vous a montrť
qu'il n'a pas les couilles de le faire.
Vous devez juste lui donner
un petit quelque chose.
Pour qu'il vous voie
sous un nouveau jour.
Comme quoi ?
Des trucs de la police.
Je ne sais pas, moi !
Quelque chose qui plaise
ŗ Carcetti
pour qu'il puisse dire que c'ťtait
son idťe de vous garder.
Des trucs de la police ?
Ce que vous faites tous
pour gagner votre vie.
Occupez-vous de votre partie
et laissez vos amis
s'occuper de la leur.
Bonjour.
J'ai mis mes affaires
dans ma salle.
L'entretien et Donnelly
vťrifient la tempťrature.
Il doit faire 30 degrťs lŗ-dedans.
Des cours de 90 minutes.
Pardon ?
ņ cette ťpoque de l'annťe,
on passe aux cours de 90 minutes.
Prťparation concentrťe en maths
et en anglais, seulement.
Je ne vous suis pas.
Et pourquoi cette chaleur ?
C'est la seule faÁon de garder
les gosses en place 90 minutes.
- Pour les endormir ?
- C'est Áa.
Alors, c'est ŗ cause des tests.
Jusqu'ŗ ce qu'ils soient finis,
tout tourne autour des tests.
Merde !
Je devrais aller passer l'hiver
au chaud.
Oý ?
J'ai vu sur "Animal Planet"
la pÍche aux marlins...
en Floride, aux Bahamas.
«a avait l'air sympa.
L'eau ťtait...
d'une couleurs incroyable.
Il va pas faire si froid
cette annťe.
- Comment tu le sais ?
- Le rťchauffement planťtaire.
Alors, pourquoi il fait
dťjŗ si froid ?
Yo, on se fait vieux.
Ouais. C'est vrai.
Oý t'ťtais, putain ?
La prison municipale
pendant un jour et demi
jusqu'ŗ ce qu'ils me rel‚chent.
AprŤs, ma grand-mŤre est tombťe
malade, j'ťtais chez elle.
Les flics t'ont collť
une inculpation ?
Juste foutu la trouille,
fausse dťclaration
parce que j'avais dit
que j'ťtais pas qui je suis.
Alors, pourquoi ils te cherchaient
comme Áa ?
Ils ont essayť de te parler ?
Ouais, d'un meurtre.
- Lequel ?
- C'est pas important
parce que je leur ai rien dit
ŗ ces salopes.
T'as pas besoin
de me convaincre, moi.
Pourquoi je dois le convaincre, lui ?
Je te le dis,
les flics te cherchaient
et ils t'ont chopť,
t'as disparu
pendant quelques jours.
Oh, oui.
Il en entendra sŻrement parler.
J'ai rien dit ŗ personne.
C'est pour Áa qu'ils m'ont foutu
la trouille,
et m'ont collť en taule
parce que je leur ai
pas dit un mot.
Ouais, alors,
va lui dire tout Áa.
ņ ta place,
j'irais le voir en premier.
Ouais, Kev, vas-y d'abord
parce que, s'ils viennent
te chercher,
- ils penseront que tu caches Áa.
- C'est Áa.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Le menu, yo.
Donne-lui un menu.
- Qu'est-ce qui est bon ?
- J'en sais foutre rien !
T'es pas censť
jurer devant un client, connard.
ArrÍte. Darnell.
D'accord.
Je veux... de la pizza.
Pizza. Quelque chose ŗ boire ?
Un soda au raisin.
Silence, s'il vous plaÓt.
- C'est tout ?
- Oui.
Merci. Dis merci.
Oui. Merci.
Le menu ?
Il doit pas dire "merci" aussi ?
- Darnell.
- Pourquoi ? Il doit le rendre.
Quand on est poli avec les gens,
on est mieux traitť.
- Asseyez-vous, s'il vous plaÓt.
- Je peux vous voir ?
Maintenant, essaie d'Ítre le serveur
et Albert, le client.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez manger ?
Donnez-moi des beignets
au crabe et un coca.
Et magnez-vous.
J'ťtais au tťlťphone non-stop
avec la 4Ťme Avenue.
Ils insistent, chaque cours
doit porter sur le test.
Oh mon Dieu.
Je croyais
que nous ťtions l'exception.
C'est le but de notre programme.
- Ils le savent.
- Pas d'exceptions.
Et des cours de 90 minutes
en maths et en anglais seulement.
Cette classe ?
Les gosses ne tiennent pas
en place 90 minutes.
…coutez, il n'y a pas quelqu'un
ŗ qui on puisse parler
face ŗ face ?
C'est la seconde chose
qu'ils m'ont dite.
L'inspectrice veut vous voir
tous les deux demain matin,
ŗ 9h00 en salle de rťunion.
Ne paniquons pas... encore.
Le business comme d'hab.
Marlo.
Tu le connaissais pas
quand on l'a volť au jeu ?
Il est pas si mauvais que Áa.
C'est qu'un nom pour moi.
Si tu avais su que c'ťtait Marlo,
tu l'aurais quand mÍme fait ?
Si seulement, j'avais su.
«a m'aurait fait encore plus plaisir.
Bubs.
C'est Herc. T'as faim ?
Yo, c'est nul ce que vous avez fait.
J'ai ťtť dťsolť
d'entendre la nouvelle.
Non seulement,
vous ťtiez en retard,
mais vous vous Ítes pas arrÍtťs.
Vous avez pas vu qu'il me tabassait ?
On est passťs lŗ ?
Je vous ai vus avec le phare bleu.
On a eu un problŤme
de communication, je l'admets.
Mais je vais te donner un tťlťphone
aujourd'hui, et Áa rťsoudra tout.
Tu verras.
Le truc, c'est qu'il y a
une camťra...
une camťra de la police
qui a disparu il y a quelques semaines.
Pour diverses raisons
que je ne peux pas expliquer,
je dois la retrouver.
Une camťra ?
Oui. Ce type, Marlo,
l'a probablement prise.
Je ne sais pas
s'il l'a vendue ou s'il...
Vous m'embÍtez pour une camťra ?
Vous devez me protťger.
Cinq minutes, vous aviez dit.
Je sais. Je te redevrai Áa.
C'est des ailes de poulet
de chez Tyrone.
Alors, voilŗ.
Je veux que tu racontes
ŗ tout le monde
qu'il y a une rťcompense de 500 $
pour cette camťra.
On ne posera pas de questions.
500 ?
Je le jure. Je les donnerai...
si c'est la bonne camťra.
Voici le modŤle
et le numťro de sťrie.
Alors, c'est 500 pour la camťra
et une boÓte de poulet pour Bubs ?
Et 100 de plus pour toi
si Áa se fait.
Mais j'ai besoin de cette camťra vite,
sinon Áa va chauffer.
…coute,
je vous ai dit que
c'est pas pour l'argent.
D'accord ?
Ce salopard,
il met ma vie en danger.
Il revient toujours,
toujours.
Il est comme un "Terminator".
Je comprends.
Je ferai tout ce que je peux
pour rťgler ton problŤme
et tu m'aideras ŗ rťgler
le mien.
C'est qui, Randy, putain ?
Un petit dealer du coin.
Il est pas dans le jeu
mais il est avec Michael et sa bande.
Et il cafte ŗ la police ?
J'le sais.
Je sais qu'il l'a fait
parce que c'est ŗ lui que j'ai dit :
"Dis ŗ Lex d'aller dans l'allťe.
Patrice l'attend".
T'ťtais censť faire Áa.
Oui, je sais, mais comme Áa,
j'essayais de garder une distance
entre Lex et moi.
T'as dit ŗ Randy
ce qui est arrivť ŗ Lex ?
Non, je le jure.
Dťgage, connard.
Qu'est-ce que t'attends ?
- Pourquoi vous me suivez ?
- Calmos, mec.
Non. Personne vient
avec moi nulle part.
Et ce Randy, alors ?
Il peut rien nous faire.
- C'est un cafteur.
- Oui, cherchez-le.
- Slim.
- Marlo.
- Comment va ?
- Pas trop mal, yo.
C'est de nouveau le moment.
Joe voulait que je vťrifie.
D'accord. Prends une chaise.
Parlons-en.
Celui-lŗ, c'est un gars
de Barksdale.
Et alors ?
«a colle pas.
Mais c'est intťressant.
J'ai achetť un tťlťphone.
Si quelque chose se passe,
tu m'appelles.
Si ce gars te vole encore,
retiens-le. Le plus possible.
J'ai pas de fric pour tout Áa.
Il y a 40 minutes lŗ-dessus
et mon numťro
est dťjŗ enregistrť.
Je t'appellerai aujourd'hui
ou demain au plus tard.
Putain, mec.
Il t'a sacrťment arrangť.
Qui c'ťtait ?
L'officier Walker.
Walker est mťchant.
- Combien ?
- Quatre.
On devrait lui niquer la gueule.
Walker ? C'est un policier.
Je dis Áa comme Áa.
Il a dit que la prochaine fois
que je pique une voiture, je suis mort.
Tu vas faire comme il dit ?
Non alors, putain.
DŤs que j'enlŤverai cette merde,
je le chercherai partout
dans la ville.
Yo, merde !
Je te l'avais dit, Namond !
Je t'avais prťvenu.
- J'ai rien fait.
- Le fric. Je t'ai eu.
Avec tes cheveux, je te reconnaÓtrais
depuis le quartier est<i>..</i>
- Laissez-moi.
- La ferme !
- Regarde ce que j'ai trouvť.
- C'est pas ŗ moi !
Les mains sur la voiture !
…carte les jambes.
- J'ai rien, putain...
- La ferme !
«a te plaÓt ?
Tu t'amuses ?
Devine ?
«a va Ítre encore mieux.
Donne-moi tes mains.
Attention la tÍte.
Nom de Dieu, vous ne perdez
pas de temps, hein ?
Nerese nous a laissť les salles
du conseil jusqu'ŗ l'investiture.
…videmment, aprŤs votre belle
performance ŗ l'ťlection.
- …videmment
- 81 % ?
82. Dans une ville oý il y a
9 Dťmocrates pour 1 Rťpublicain...
«a aurait ťtť embarrassant
de faire moins.
Alors...
que pouvons-nous faire pour vous,
M. le Sťnateur ?
D'abord, je voulais clarifier
les choses.
S'il y a des ressentiments
sur ce qui s'est passť
pendant les primaires...
Vous allez rendre l'argent ?
M. le Sťnateur,
la journťe a ťtť trŤs longue.
J'irai droit au but.
J'entends que vous avez
un problŤme
ŗ la tÍte du Dťpartement
de police.
Vous avez demandť ŗ Burrell
de dťmissionner. Il a refusť.
Je cherche un remplaÁant.
Les pasteurs aiment Burrell,
la prťsidente du conseil aussi.
Nous pensons que lorsque
nous trouverons un bon candidat,
Mlle Campbell et les pasteurs
trouveront ce changement sage.
Mais le conseil doit approuver
les augmentations de salaire.
Elles faciliteraient les choses.
Je peux demander ŗ Nerese
de les faire passer,
de convaincre certains pasteurs
de s'ťcarter de Burrell.
La situation devrait Ítre rťsolue
le plus tŰt possible.
Je ferai de mon mieux, mon ami.
Et que faisons-nous pour vous
en ťchange ?
Je suis ŗ Annapolis.
D'aprŤs ce que j'entends,
vous pourriez y Ítre aussi
dans deux ans.
Nous travaillerons peut-Ítre ensemble.
Merci de m'avoir reÁu.
Seigneur !
Il est malin.
Il s'excuse pour la magouille
ŗ court terme
et dans la foulťe
nous coince ŗ long terme.
Burrell et lui
sont comme cul et chemise.
Et on sait ce qu'est la magouille
ŗ long terme ?
Au moins, on sait qu'il y en a une.
"Mer-de"...
Essaie d'appeler encore une fois.
Je sais qu'elle va pas rťpondre.
Ma mŤre rťpond pas
quand elle va ŗ la gym.
Quand est-ce qu'elle rentre ?
Elle va ŗ New York, aprŤs.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle va
faire ŗ New York ?
Des courses.
Elle va voir le spectacle
"La Couleur pourpre".
C'est lŗ que mon boulot
devient intťressant.
Si tu pouvais joindre un parent,
le juge des mineurs te rel‚cherait
pour une premiŤre arrestation
pour vente de drogue.
Mais maintenant, tu ferais bien
d'avoir ta brosse ŗ dents,
parce que ce sera
le centre pour juvťniles ce soir.
Namond, t'as peur ?
Si c'ťtait Cheltenham,
je comprendrais,
mais le centre pour juvťniles
est de l'autre cŰtť de la ville.
Le quartier est et le quartier ouest
se font la guerre lŗ-dedans.
Y'a des gars
qui se font violer.
C'est ce que j'ai entendu.
C'est dur lŗ-bas.
Je sais pas si c'est si dur que Áa.
J'ai entendu autre chose.
T'as pas d'autre famille ?
J'ai une tante dans le comtť de P.G.
T'as son numťro ?
De toute faÁon,
je t'emmŤnerai pas si tard, alors...
S'il vous plaÓt...
Bon, ťcoute :
deux de mes gars
font une double journťe,
ils feront la nuit.
Si tu peux te mettre
sur ce banc lŗ-bas,
tu peux rester pour la nuit.
Mais demain matin,
tu devras faire lever ta tante
ou ta mŤre,
sinon, je te ferai enfermer.
Ne bouge pas de ce banc.
Si tu veux aller aux toilettes,
vas-y maintenant.
Sinon, reste lŗ,
n'embÍte personne
sinon, ils te feront enfermer
tout de suite.
D'accord. Merci.
C'est l'Armťe du Salut ici, putain.
Je vais informer
le commandant de nuit.
Yo, Lieutenant...
C'est un flic ?
Non. Probablement
qu'il en achŤte pour ma mŤre.
C'est pour Áa ?
…coutez Je vous ai dit
que je veux qu'il parte.
Je veux qu'il soit loin
de Bug et moi.
Qu'est-ce qu'il t'a fait ?
D'accord.
On va s'occuper de Áa, patron.
Un autre cambriolage d'ťglise
dans le secteur 2 hier soir.
L'ťglise mťthodiste
de Madison Park.
C'est ce qu'on appelle
une ťruption.
Et de la pommade nous serait utile.
On doit arrÍter ces connards.
«a avance, d'ailleurs ?
Pas encore.
Qui a attrapť le dernier ?
McNulty ?
- On y travaille. On devrait parler.
- D'accord.
ņ propos d'arrestations, les ordres
sont de nettoyer les coins de rue.
Ils veulent doubler le nombre
d'arrestations le mois prochain.
Mais comment, putain ?
Je croyais que les ťlections
ťtaient finies.
Les patrons veulent des contraventions
pour atteintes ŗ la qualitť de vie.
De quoi parlons-nous,
des dťchets sur la voie publique ?
Les dťsordres, l'indťcence publique.
C'est des conneries.
- La thťorie des fenÍtres cassťes.
- «a a marchť ŗ New York.
- On n'est pas ŗ New York.
- «a pourrait marcher ici.
- «a n'a jamais marchť.
- «a n'a jamais ťtť bien fait.
Sanctionnez aussi la consommation
d'alcool sur la voie publique.
- Pourquoi pas se concentrer sur les PV ?
- Faut augmenter Áa, aussi.
Il paraÓt que le Chef veut gonfler
les arrestations.
L'alcool sur la voie publique,
c'ťtait sacro-saint ici.
- Tant qu'elles ťtaient emballťes.
- On respectait au moins Áa.
Ce que chacun buvait,
c'ťtait son affaire.
Vous les avez emmenťs
dans un restaurant ?
Oui. Chez Ruth Chris.
Serviettes en tissu.
Oui. Jolis couverts,
plusieurs fourchettes.
- Comment se sont-ils comportťs ?
- PlutŰt bien, en l'occurrence.
Nous ont-ils embarrassťs ?
"Nous" ? Non, pas de problŤme
pour nous,
mais...
ils ťtaient intimidťs, embarrassťs
et mal ŗ l'aise comme tout
mais ils s'en sont sortis.
Mlle Sheperdson, ce ne sont pas
des enfants
qui pourront rester en place
pour les tests de l'ťtat,
et encore moins les rťussir.
Ce sont les enfants qui allaient
empÍcher les autres de rťussir.
Alors, nous les excluons ?
Non, nous ne faisons pas Áa.
Vous ne les ťduquez pas.
Vous les rendez sociables.
C'ťtait pareil avant.
Il n'y a pas de raison d'Ítre obtus.
- Pardon ?
- Attendez, attendez.
…coutez Ce qu'il veut dire,
c'est que si vous mettez un livre
devant ces enfants,
un problŤme au tableau,
ou leur enseignez chaque problŤme
du test de l'ťtat,
cela n'aura pas d'importance,
parce qu'ils n'apprennent pas
pour notre monde, mais pour le leur.
Ils savent exactement ŗ quoi
ils s'entraÓnent
et ce que tout le monde
attend d'eux.
J'attends d'eux qu'ils soient
des ťlŤves.
Mais il ne s'agit pas de vous ou nous,
du test ou du systŤme,
mais de ce qu'ils attendent
d'eux-mÍmes.
Chacun d'eux sait qu'il retournera
au coin de la rue.
Leurs frŤres et súurs...
Leurs parents...
sont passťs par les mÍmes classes.
Nous avons fait semblant
de les instruire et eux d'apprendre
et oý cela a-t-il menť ?
Aux mÍmes satanťs coins de rues.
Ces enfants ne sont pas des imbťciles.
Ils ne connaissent pas notre monde
mais connaissent le leur.
Mon Dieu, ils...
ils savent exactement ce qu'on fait.
Nous avons indiquť Áa quand
vous avez approuvť le programme.
Approuvť sous condition.
Quand vous avez approuvť
le programme sous condition,
nous avons indiquť que nous
nous adresserions ŗ des enfants
ayant besoin de devenir sociables
avant de pouvoir Ítre
correctement ťduquťs.
Nous ne pouvons pas mentir.
Pas ŗ eux.
Capitaine, ligne 3.
C'est terminť.
Des nouvelles de ta mŤre ?
C'est un cas de nťgligence.
Je le veux.
Et cette tante ?
Tu connais pas
d'autres adultes ?
Comme qui ?
Je ne sais pas.
J'essaie de te donner
une derniŤre chance
parce qu'une fois que je serai sorti,
il faudra qu'on t'envoie au centre.
J'ai un professeur.
M. Colvin.
Vous le connaissez ?
C'est un ancien policier.
Grand ? Chauve ?
Oui.
Oui, je le connais.
Et si t'arrÍtais l'indic ?
Celui qui a un chariot.
Comment il s'appelle ?
Bubbles.
Bubbles, oui.
Fais dire ŗ Bubbles
qu'il est Fuzzy Dunlop.
Mais c'est un indic des EnquÍtes
Criminelles depuis des annťes.
Kima lui a donnť un numťro
quand elle ťtait encore en civil.
Herc, tu as travaillť avec lui
sous ce numťro
dans l'affaire Barksdale.
Alors comment foutre en l'air
son identitť ?
Putain.
La seule faÁon de t'extirper
de tout Áa,
c'est d'arrÍter de mentir.
LŤve ton cul
et va dans le bureau de Marimow
et dis : "Lieutenant,
j'ai fait une erreur.
J'ai fondť ma conviction
personnelle sur un indicateur
alors qu'en fait,
elle provenait d'une camťra".
Que j'ai obtenue ŗ la Sťcuritť Interne
sans autorisation.
Non, non, non.
Il va m'enlever mes galons pour Áa.
Peut-Ítre, mais si tu attends
que la S.I. cherche la camťra
et qu'il comprenne
que tu as menti,
il t'arrachera les couilles.
Allez !
Viens !
Au coin.
Je t'ai eu cette fois, salopard.
En vťrifiant mes papiers,
je m'aperÁois
que j'ai peut-Ítre
commis une nťgligence.
Regardez-moi toutes ces conneries !
Tous les jours,
on est envahis
de conneries de Lester Freamon.
RETOURS D'ASSIGNATIONS
BARKSDALE
Qu'est-ce que vous dites ?
Que j'ai ťtť dťsordonnť
dans mes papiers
et en consťquence,
j'ai fait des confusions
sur certaines choses.
Un peu, que vous avez
ťtť dťsordonnť.
J'ai repris vos rapports
sur deux semaines.
Rien ne mentionne une rencontre
avec l'indicateur 238.
Vous avez vťrifiť tous mes rapports ?
Du mieux que j'ai pu.
- …coutez, chef...
- …teignez cette saloperie.
Je commence ŗ croire
que ce Fuzzy
n'existe pas.
Je commence ŗ croire
que vous aviez simplement suivi
Stanfield dans la gare
et attrapť la premiŤre nana
ŗ qui il s'est frottť.
- C'est ce qui s'est passť ?
- Non, chef.
Si vous me mentez, Sergent,
je vous coincerai, j'enverrai toute
cette embrouille aux EnquÍtes Internes
et je distribuerai des sandwichs
ŗ votre exťcution.
Oui, chef.
Vous ne m'avez pas apportť
d'affaire valable,
ni sur Marlo Stanfield,
ni personne d'autre.
Apportez-moi autre chose
que des plaintes
et je pourrais laisser passer
quelques trucs.
Dukie est en colŤre
contre tout le monde.
Salope de cafteuse !
C'ťtait quoi Áa, putain ?
Je sais pas.
C'est pas vrai !
Vous dťgradez la qualitť
de vie de ce quartier.
De la biŤre.
Oh, non, allez...
Cousin, si tu dois te taper une biŤre,
choisis une bonne bibine.
Quoi !... Non ! Ma biŤre !
Mes chaussures !
Nom de Dieu !
Quelle est l'infraction ?
Stationnement ŗ un arrÍt de bus,
vignette expirťe.
Travail de premiŤre classe, Baker.
Ce sont les ordres
d'en haut,
directement du 8Ťme ťtage
de centre-ville.
Nos patrons gonflent les statistiques
pour le nouveau maire.
Je sais que tu trouves Áa nul,
mais je passe ma journťe
oý on me dit.
Baker, laisse-moi te dire
un petit secret :
un policier en patrouille,
c'est la vraie dictature
de l'Amťrique.
On peut foutre la trouille
ŗ un gars,
l'enfermer vraiment,
ou dire "rien ŗ foutre...",
se garer sous l'autoroute
et se bourrer
et nos collŤgues couvriront Áa.
Personne, vraiment, ne nous dit
comment passer la journťe.
J'ai sorti les rapports
sur les cambriolages d'ťglises.
- Ah oui ?
- Oui. Il y a un schťma rťcurrent.
Le moment et l'endroit.
Ils opŤrent de l'ouest au nord-ouest
en passant par Sandtown-Winchester.
Les trois derniers...
ici, ici et ici...
en bleu, ce sont les ťglises
pas cambriolťes
les plus proches
des ťglises cambriolťes.
Tu as trouvť Áa
dans les rapports d'incidents ?
C'est pour Áa qu'on fait
la paperasserie.
Vous me donnez
une contravention, putain !
«a va pas, la tÍte ?
J'habite ici !
«a pourrait mal tourner.
C'est ce qu'on veut, non ?
Plus d'arrestations.
Viens.
Pas de justice, pas de paix.
Ce sera seulement pour ce soir.
Sa mŤre revient demain.
ņ vous de voir.
Ce jeune homme a une haute opinion
de vous, patron.
Il a invoquť votre nom
avec respect.
Il n'y a que quelques semaines,
il me traitait
de tous les noms.
"M. Colvin, Monsieur,
allez vous faire foutre".
Au moins, j'ai dit : "Monsieur".
Alors, quelle est l'inculpation ?
Vente de drogue.
Il fait Áa
depuis quelques semaines.
Premier coup,
deuxiŤme avertissement de ma part.
Vous devriez l'envoyer
au centre juvťnile.
S'il veut tellement
Ítre un gangster,
c'est peut-Ítre le moment
qu'il goŻte ŗ la prison ?
Allez, M. C, ne me faites pas Áa.
Je l'ai fait dormir sur le banc
des Stups hier soir,
si Áa compte pour quelque chose.
Il n'y a personne d'autre ?
Ami, famille ?
Vous avez toujours ťtť gentil
avec les crťtins.
Bon.
Je vais appeler ma femme.
Oui. Monte dans cet immeuble.
C'ťtait dťlicieux.
Il y en a encore.
Non, merci. Je garde
de la place pour le dessert.
ņ la mode ?
Hein ?
Tu veux de la glace dessus ?
Oh, oui, Madame.
Quelles bonnes maniŤres.
D'aprŤs ce que tu m'as dit,
mon lapin,
je m'attendais plus
ŗ une aventure.
"Mon lapin" ?
Seuls mes amis
m'appellent "mon lapin".
- Oui, mais pourquoi ?
- Tu n'as pas besoin de le savoir.
Et si tu le dis ŗ quelqu'un,
je te coupe les couilles.
Je les couperai et les donnerai
ŗ Donnelly dans un bocal.
Ne doute pas de moi, mon gars.
Vous n'avez pas de gosses ?
Grands. Ils sont ŗ l'universitť
et mÍme plus vieux.
Tu m'as dit que ces gosses
sont durs.
Merci, chťrie.
Ne te laisse pas tromper.
Il joue les Eddie Haskell.
Eddie Haskell ?
Qui c'est, Áa ?
Toi, fiston. Crois-moi.
Asseyez-vous.
Mettez les vŰtres contre le mur
avec les autres.
Le bus est en train de revenir
du centre.
- La clť de la salle d'entretien.
- Pourquoi donc ?
Vol ŗ main armťe.
ņ main armťe ?
Ils sortaient de St Martin.
On les inculpe de celui-lŗ
mais peut-Ítre d'autres encore.
C'est pas vrai ?
Je savais bien qu'il y a encore
de vrais criminels ici.
Des gens sont arrÍtťs pour avoir
traversť en dehors des clous.
On enferme des gens pour consommation
d'alcool sur la voie publique,
pour dťsordre,
pour attroupement.
Les habitants des quartiers
apprťcient parfois
ce type d'arrestations.
ņ part qu'on enferme
les habitants des quartiers.
Certains de mes gars ne voient
que les statistiques.
Les ťlections sont passťe, non ?
Pour qui on fait Áa ?
«a vient de Burrell ou de Rawls ?
On a eu Áa du chef des patrouilles.
«a vient d'en haut, c'est sŻr.
- Et le moral des hommes ?
- Divisť, je dirais.
Ceux qui aiment les statistiques
sont excitťs.
Et le reste ?
On ne sait pas oý se tourner.
Je pensais que le nouveau maire
changerait Áa,
n'encouragerait pas Áa.
Tu niques encore
cette salope ?
Oui. J'ai une sacrťe chtouille.
Quand est-ce que tu vas
lui refiler la chtouille ŗ elle ?
Slim.
B. «a va ?
Bien.
- Poot.
- «a va.
- J'ai entendu que t'ťtais sorti.
- Ouais.
- Bienvenue.
- Merci, mec.
T'es avec Prop Joe maintenant.
J'aurais jamais pensť.
Oui, la vie est bizarre.
Oui. C'est Áa.
«a va, Marlo et toi ?
«a marche avec lui ?
Autant que je sache, oui.
Pourquoi ?
Ce qu'il a fait ŗ ton pote.
De quel pote tu parles ?
Le gros,
qui se frotte les mains
tout le temps.
Kevin ? Qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
T'as pas entendu ?
Chris et Snoop l'ont embarquť
dans une allťe.
Il est dans une maison vide
maintenant.
Comment tu sais Áa ?
Je les ai vus
mettre la main sur lui.
Et maintenant on en parle
dans la rue.
Dťsolť, mec.
Allons-y.
Bon.
Regardez la question suivante,
page 20.
Comme vous le voyez...
ŗ la page 20,
on vous demandera parfois
le contraire
des mots soulignťs.
Merci, M. Pryzbylewski.
Merci.
Bon, rangez vos livrets d'examen.
Nous les reprendrons demain.
Il nous reste 45 minutes.
Nous pouvons faire
"Le Dernier des Mohicans"...
- Non !
- Non !
ou des exercices de probabilitťs.
- Ouais.
- Oui.
- Je vais chercher les trucs.
- D'accord.
Je veux voir vos fiches d'exercices.
Kareem, tu veux jouer
aux dťs avec moi ?
Non, pas avec toi.
On ne fait pas que jouer.
On fait des maths.
Je vais jouer avec toi.
Viens.
Sans plaisanter.
Je rigole pas.
Tu te reposes ?
T'en veux un, Renaldo ?
Non.
Ils viennent de chez Faidley.
Il pourrait rester ŗ la maison
toute la journťe.
On verra bien.
- C'est pour mes allocations.
- Vous avez un rendez-vous ?
- Pourquoi il me faut un rendez-vous ?
- Elle n'en a pas besoin, Zenobia.
- Dťsolťe, c'ťtait pour faire vrai.
- Je peux voir quelqu'un ?
Vous devez prendre un numťro
et attendre.
Je dois voir quelqu'un tout de suite.
Ne te mets pas en colŤre.
«a rend les gens dťfensifs.
Dis-lui ce dont tu as besoin
calmement.
- La carte est pas arrivťe.
- Nous l'avons envoyťe.
- Elle a peut-Ítre ťtť volťe.
- Dťsolťe. On ne peut rien faire.
- Va te faire foutre !
- Chandra !
- Elle m'aide pas.
- Elles sont comme Áa.
Dis-lui juste ce dont tu as besoin.
- Il me faut une autre carte, connasse.
- Chandra.
C'est la rťalitť.
Va te faire foutre pour de vrai.
Calme-toi !
Calme-toi !
Va avec Mlle Mason.
- L‚chez-moi !
- Mlle Mason !
Je vais chercher la police
de l'ťcole.
Elle a fait...
Et puis elle a fait...
Une journťe habituelle ?
Je ne sais pas.
C'est mon premier jour.
Votre premier jour ?
Mme Donnelly supervise
ce programme.
OK.
Bonjour, Mesdames.
Vous pouvez me donner
quelque chose ŗ manger ?
Dieu vous bťnisse.
Bonjour, Rťvťrend.
Yo.
Content que tu rťpondes enfin.
J'ťtais en rťunion hier.
T'as repťrť ce salopard ?
Non, je vois les gars de Marlo...
prÍts ŗ faire une livraison.
- Oý ?
- Edmondson, prŤs de Pulaski.
Tu les vois, lŗ ?
Ouais, il a le paquet.
Un sac noir, il le met
dans le coffre.
- Il entre dans la voiture.
- Quelle marque ?
Une Lincoln rťcente.
Tu veux la plaque ?
- Oui, dis-moi.
- L-O-U-E-Z-D-I-E-U.
Ouais, il dťmarre,
il tourne sur Gilmore.
Dozerman, passe-moi Foxtrot.
Bon boulot, Bubs.
On s'en occupe.
Mesdames, un portable ?
Une demi-heure payťe.
Non, merci.
Ce que j'ai vu aujourd'hui,
n'ťtait pas de l'ťducation
ŗ mon sens du terme,
et ne semblait pas
trŤs sociable, non plus.
Vous n'Ítes pas venue
le meilleur jour.
Ou votre pire jour ?
Dans l'ensemble, ils ont fait
beaucoup de progrŤs.
Ils viennent en classe,
sont plus impliquťs.
Nous communiquons avec eux.
Moins de crises,
pas de renvois.
Mais apprennent-ils
vraiment quelque chose ?
Oui. Nous pensons que oui.
Soyez honnÍtes.
Si ce programme devait continuer
pour le reste de l'annťe scolaire,
combien de vos ťlŤves
pourraient vťritablement
retourner dans une classe normale ?
Qu'en pensez-vous, Mlle Duquette ?
Namond, Darnell,
peut-Ítre Zenobia.
…tant donnť
notre point de dťpart,
et le fait que ces enfants ne sont pas
en train de perturber d'autres classes...
Bien. Mme Donnelly.
C'est un accomplissement
formidable.
M. Withers ?
Je suis d'accord
avec Mme Donnelly.
Vous n'avez encore rien dit.
Je ne vois pas Áa comme Áa.
Beaucoup d'enfants
sont profondťment blessťs...
par ce qu'ils ont vu,
comment ils ont vťcu.
Je pense que tout gain
ou progrŤs est temporaire.
Ce programme
a peut-Ítre une brŤche.
Foxtrot 23-30.
Suspect en vue.
Vťhicule en direction de Mulberry.
M'entendez-vous ?
- Bien reÁu. Nous y sommes presque.
- Bien reÁu.
AprŤs votre appel,
j'ai vťrifiť.
«a venait directement de Burrell.
Il est passť outre Rawls,
bien que je lui aie dit...
Burrell fait un coup
pour que vous le gardiez.
En faisant... comment
avez-vous appelť Áa ?
En gonflant les statistiques.
Ce type est incroyable.
Il contredit
mes discussions avec Rawls,
avec vous, avec tout le monde.
Il vous avise de quelque chose.
Il reprend le contrŰle
du dťpartement.
Il pense que vous ne pouvez pas
le renvoyer.
Est-ce que Rawls le sait ?
Je suppose qu'il en a entendu parler
depuis longtemps
par une demi-douzaine
de commandants de secteurs.
Pourquoi n'est-il pas venu me voir ?
Demandez-lui.
Et pourquoi Ítes-vous venu ?
Pourquoi n'Ítes-vous pas allť
voir Rawls ?
Parce que j'ai besoin de savoir
si vous Ítes sťrieux.
Si Rawls est venu vous voir
et que ces conneries continuent,
alors vous Ítes d'accord avec Áa,
ce qui est un problŤme.
S'il n'est pas venu vous voir,
soit il est d'accord avec Áa,
ce qui est aussi un problŤme,
ou il donne assez de latitude ŗ Burrell
pour que vous vous f‚chiez
et le renvoyiez pour insubordination.
J'ai besoin de connaÓtre
votre position.
Je vous ai donnť ma parole.
Oui, en effet.
Merci d'Ítre sorti de la hiťrarchie.
Je n'en ferai pas une habitude.
Restez dans la voiture !
Restez dans la voiture.
Les mains sur le volant !
- Montrez vos mains.
- Quel est le problŤme ?
Sortez lentement.
Gardez les mains en l'air.
Mon fils, soyez plus doux.
Ta gueule, je suis pas ton fils !
Ce type...
C'est quoi, Áa ?
C'est quoi, Áa ?
Je vais noter
votre nom et numťro de badge !
Daniels. Je ne crois pas
le connaÓtre.
Il ne s'est guŤre
mÍlť ŗ la politique,
bien qu'il ait ťtť mariť
ŗ la nouvelle conseillŤre du 11e.
- Marla Daniels ?
- C'est Áa.
Nous ne voulons absolument pas
de lui comme chef, Nerese.
Je l'ai confrontť
il y a quelques annťes,
et il n'a pas voulu m'ťcouter.
Il n'ťcoutera ni vous,
ni les pasteurs
ou personne d'autre.
Seulement Carcetti ?
Il est du cŰtť du maire,
sans aucun doute.
De combien Carcetti veut-il
augmenter le salaire ?
50 000 au moins,
pour rendre le poste
compťtitif au niveau national.
Accordez-lui 25 000.
C'est assez pour qu'il croie
pouvoir vous convaincre,
mais pas assez
pour qu'il attire quelqu'un de fort.
Entre-temps, Carcetti devra
donner six mois
ŗ Daniels avant de pouvoir
l'augmenter encore,
pour sauver les apparences.
«a nous fait gagner du temps.
Assez pour qu'Ervin montre
au maire qui commande.
Et pour que les ťvťnements ternissent
le nouvel ťclat de Cedric Daniels.
Je sais qu'il n'est pas le saint
qu'il prťtend Ítre.
Ici le Sťnateur Davis.
Le maire est lŗ ?
Dites-lui simplement
que son ami Clay
a fait dťbloquer une augmentation
de salaire pour le chef de police.
Dites-lui...
Prenez note.
Dites-lui que le Sťnateur Davis
a ses intťrÍts ŗ cúur.
C'est Áa.
Merci.
Hť, Maman.
Comment c'ťtait ŗ New York ?
Bonjour, Mme Brice.
Comment allez-vous ?
Qui me le demande ?
C'est mon prof, Maman...
M. Colvin.
Pourquoi il est lŗ ?
T'as des ennuis ?
Il a passť la nuit chez nous
comme vous ťtiez
ŗ New York.
Dis-lui.
Les flics m'ont arrÍtť
pour vente de drogue.
Ils allaient m'envoyer
au centre juvťnile.
Mais nous l'avons pris chez nous.
Laissez mon fils tranquille.
Et toi, t'avais peur
d'aller au centre juvťnile ?
Qu'est-ce qui va pas ?
Rentre ŗ la maison !
Le gosse a compris.
Tous ces ivrognes et excitťs
et petits merdeux,
ces taggeurs
et ces gars qui pissent en public,
et voilŗ qu'on amŤne
des cambriolages ŗ main armťe.
C'est gentil ŗ toi
de le laisser faire.
Il deviendra peut-Ítre
un bon policier.
«a doit venir de quelque part.
La nouvelle gťnťration.
Et vous, les gars ?
Vous suivrez les traces
de votre pŤre ?
J'crois pas, non.
- «a va pas ?
- Vous ferez quoi, alors ?
- Crťateur de jeux vidťos.
- Star de rock.
Ils veulent faire de l'argent.
- Tu as ťtť un bon professeur.
- Et toi, Petit Bunk ?
Tu seras inspecteur
comme ton papa ?
- Chef de la police.
- Non.
Pourquoi pas ?
Et toi ?
Il en est encore au stade
de neurochirurgien pťdiatrique.
- Bonjour.
- Hť.
Hť ! Elena, comment Áa va ?
Bien et vous ?
Pas trop mal.
Hť, les garÁons.
Comment Áa va ?
Vous pouvez dire bonjour ?
Ils vont bien.
Ils ont de drŰles de maniŤres.
Pas de problŤmes.
Mes gosses sont pareils.
On ťtait en train de finir.
Assieds-toi.
D'accord.
Juste une minute.
Papa, t'as 5 $ pour le juke-box ?
Quoi ? C'est plus
trois disques pour 25 cents ?
Vous avez des devoirs ?
Finis, Papa nous a aidťs.
J'ai fini tŰt. Tiens.
Vous voulez y aller aussi ?
Qu'est-ce que vous buvez ?
Du vin blanc.
Rien d'autre, merci.
Alors, c'est vrai ?
Tu ne bois plus ?
Une biŤre de temps en temps.
Rien de plus.
Comment va Dennis ?
Dennis est... Dennis.
On est proches,
et on ne l'est pas.
On verra.
- Comment va Beadie ?
- Bien.
Les gosses ont
mon numťro, mais...
Si j'avais su que tu deviendrais
adulte un jour...
Merde.
Et c'est moi qui lui ai dit
qu'il ferait bien
d'aller parler ŗ ce mec.
«a semble diffťrent
maintenant.
Il faut voir Áa
du point de vue de Marlo.
Quelle diffťrence avec Wallace ?
Parce que Stringer a dit
que Wallace a caftť.
Kevin a peut-Ítre caftť aussi.
Mais il ne l'a pas fait.
On devait flinguer Wallace !
Marlo pensait
qu'il devait flinguer Kevin.
Merde...
Mais il l'a pas fait.
Voilŗ ce que je dis.
Il a le coeur froid.
Le monde a le coeur froid, Bodie.
Toi qui disais que Áa se rťchauffait...
Le monde va dans un sens,
les gens de l'autre.
Elton Brand...
qu'est-ce que tu sais de lui ?
Rien. Tu vois ?
Bug, tu as vu ton papa ?
Il est allť au magasin.
Oý tu vas ?
Je vais le chercher.
Tu le trouveras pas.
Pourquoi pas ?
Parce qu'il ne reviendra pas.
Merci.
- De quoi il s'agit ?
- Comme si tu le savais pas.
Je veux pas avoir d'emmerdes.
T'aimes les petits garÁons,
mon salaud ?
Quoi ?
Les garÁons.
T'aimes les niquer ?
J'aime la chatte.
Compris ? Les fesses.
Je vis avec une nana.
Elle a des gosses ?
Je touche pas aux gosses !
Qui t'a dit Áa ?
Je sais ce que tu dis,
mais en taule,
y'a pas de chatte.
Oui, merde.
T'as ťtť en taule ?
Les hommes ont des besoins, non ?
Oui.
Merde !
T'as mÍme pas attendu
de faire entrer ce salopard.
Euh, oui...
je peux avoir les légumes variés
et le riz blanc ?
OK, légumes variés, riz blanc.
Nom de Dieu, mec.
Tu parles comme une pédale.
C'est qu'un resto chinetoque.
D'abord, tu commandes.
Vas-y.
J'ai dit que je paie.
Regarde ce négro
étaler son fric
comme un grand gangster.
Ouais, Na',
une vraie pute.
J'vous paie à bouffer,
c'est tout.
J'aime rester simple
avec les petits.
Va te faire foutre, mec.
- Il parlait de toi.
- Je parlais de toi.
- Que désirez-vous ?
- Du yakame à la graisse de dinde.
Yakame, nouilles...
- Ce négro veut de la graisse de dinde.
- Pourquoi pas, yo ?
Ma mère, elle en prend toujours.
Yo, t'as ce qu'ils appellent
un comportement à risque.
- Tu sais, Dukie ?
- Fiche-moi la paix.
Je paie.
Combien ?
- 4 $.
- Pourquoi c'est si drôle ?
Ils te mettent en boîte.
- Qu'est-ce qui va pas avec le yakame ?
- Rien du tout.
C'est juste que les alcoolos
prennent de la graisse de dinde
pour vomir la gnôle qu'ils ont bue
et s'en foutre plein la gueule
de nouveau.
C'est bon, cette saloperie.
Pourquoi t'achètes pas à manger ?
C'est tout ce que t'auras.
Ne m'en demande pas plus.
C'est sacrément bon,
cette saloperie.
Yo, vous avez entendu
ce qui est arrivé au Petit Kevin ?
- Quoi ?
- Il est mort.
- Il est dans les maisons vides.
- Pourquoi ?
Il a déconné, je suppose.
Petits cons, qu'est-ce que
vous foutez dans mon avenue ?
- On mange.
- Mon cul.
Vous prévoyez sûrement
de piquer un sac à main.
Ramenez vos culs
dans leur réserve.
Comment ça va, petit ?
T'as besoin d'aide pour manger ?
J'ai dit : dégagez !
Vous avez entendu ces conneries ?
"Mon avenue".
Elle est autant à nous
qu'à lui.
Walker est méchant, yo.
Il vole et bat les gens.
On devrait se venger
de toutes les saloperies
qu'il fait.
Tu veux te battre
avec la police ?
Pas directement avec lui,
mais lui faire mal,
taillader ses pneus
ou quelque chose comme ça.
On pourrait fourrer
des capotes dans sa voiture.
Ça serait un message.
Quel genre ?
On pourrait coller des autocollants
sur son pare-brise.
Ils sont durs à enlever.
Attendez, attendez.
L'Officier Walker va au club
sur Stockton,
là où les policiers
du quartier ouest se retrouvent.
J'ai vu sa voiture là-bas.
C'est noté.
SUR ÉCOUTE
"Si on joue dans la saleté,
on se salit".
Je compatis,
mais je peux seulement vous dire
qu'il y a une procédure
pour des plaintes comme celle-ci.
Ne nous parlez pas
de la procédure, M. le Maire.
La police de la ville nous traite
ainsi depuis des années.
Vous devez comprendre
que nous considérons cela
un affront à l'Église.
Nous demandons
un comité de contrôle civil
depuis des dizaines d'années.
Sans cela, comment avoir confiance
en toute enquête
pour toute plainte ?
Pardonnez-moi,
mais aux dernières nouvelles,
le département avait
un chef noir
et un directeur
des Enquêtes Internes noir.
Le problème provient du système.
Quant au Chef Burrell...
nous comprenons
que son autorité est maintenant limitée.
M. le Maire, quand il s'agit
de questions comme celle-ci,
pensez-vous que nous ayons confiance
en l'Adjoint Rawls ?
J'espère que vous voudrez bien
ne pas juger à l'avance
la réaction du département
avant même que l'enquête commence,
tout comme je ne le ferai pas.
Soyez assurés que je prends
cet incident au sérieux
et que j'examinerai tous les faits.
Eh bien, M. le Maire, vous aviez dit
que votre porte serait ouverte
et jusque là, je vous félicite
de tenir cette promesse.
Ma porte vous sera toujours ouverte.
Merci.
S'ils n'ont pas obtenu
de comité civil du temps de Royce,
comment peuvent-ils penser
l'obtenir de moi ?
Ils sont en train de te tester,
de voir à quel point tu es vulnérable
sur les trucs raciaux.
Sur Burrell aussi,
pour ce que ça vaut.
Un comité civil
n'a aucune chance.
Si tu acceptes maintenant,
tu t'inclineras devant les pasteurs
pendant quatre ans.
Et alors ? Je leur jette un os
et je vire un flic idiot ?
Si on punit ce flic,
le flic moyen
me détestera
et je ne changerai rien
dans la ville sans le soutien
de la troupe.
Si tu ne le vires pas,
tu foutras en pétard
la majorité de l'infrastructure politique.
Miam-miam !
Ma première coupe de merde.
Encercle ça ici.
Et appuie ici.
C'est le moment de travailler.
Vous avez du travail à faire ?
Vous notez les données ?
- Ouais.
- Bien.
Charlene, qu'est-ce que
tu ne comprends pas ?
Tout.
Essayons de trouver
une autre façon.
Quel est le diamètre ?
- Hein ?
- Sept.
Bien. Quelle est la moitié
de ça ?
On peut pas enlever
la moitié.
Disons que tu as 10 $
et que tu en donnes
la moitié à Jasmine.
Pourquoi je ferais ça ?
Fais semblant, d'accord ?
Tu lui donnes la moitié,
combien a-t-elle ?
- Ben, cinq.
- Bien.
Maintenant, disons
que tu as 7 $
et tu lui en donnes la moitié,
combien a-t-elle ?
3,5 $.
Bon, alors...
Yo, M. Prez,
regardez ça.
Pourquoi on le suit pas
depuis sa casa ?
Pour qu'on le perde de nouveau ?
Papa, rien ne dit
qu'il va revenir par là.
- Et s'il prend une autre route...
- D'accord.
On le suivra
depuis sa casa demain.
Tu fais la gueule.
Ne fais pas la gueule.
Omar, j'en ai marre de ça.
Lo siento, petit.
Lo siento.
Hé, regarde,
la voilà.
Bon.
On est d'accord, décourager
un voleur dans la rue,
ça demande du courage.
Et on est d'accord qu'il faut
du courage pour passer la nuit
à Cheltenham ou Hickey.
C'est une bonne liste,
mais y a-t-il beaucoup d'exemples
qu'on peut trouver
en dehors de ceux
concernant la rue ?
Il me faut un volontaire.
Pas moi.
Et toi, Albert ?
Non.
Si on est volontaire sans savoir
pour quoi faire, on est débile.
Bon, d'accord.
Il me faut un volontaire
pour monter sur cette caisse.
Il aura un bandeau sur les yeux,
tombera et nous le rattraperons
avant qu'il touche le sol.
- Albert ?
- C'est stupide.
Et toi, Namond ?
Attendez, laissez-moi répéter.
Vous voulez que je monte
sur cette caisse,
mette un bandeau et tombe
et vous croyez que ces petits cons
vont me rattraper ?
Sûrement pas.
Hé, si vous me laissez tomber,
ça va barder.
D'acc.
Bon, rassemblez-vous tous.
Oh, merde.
Tu es prêt ? À trois.
Un, deux, trois.
Laisse-toi tomber.
Ouah ! Putain !
C'était chouette !
Bon, qui veut être le suivant ?
Albert ?
Je fais pas de conneries
comme ça !
Allez vous faire foutre, vous
et vous tous, salopes !
On t'aime pas de toute façon.
Calmez-vous,
calmez-vous.
L'affaire du jour,
c'est les barres de chocolat Hershey,
trois pour 10 cents.
Et j'ai tous vos bonbons
préférés aussi,
Deante, j'ai ta réglisse...
rouge et noire, les deux.
Randy, le cafteur.
Nom de Dieu, regarde.
C'est bien ?
On le laisse là ?
Ce grand gars avec Prop Joe ?
Yo, vraiment,
sur cette magouille,
plus on en apprend,
et moins on en sait.
- On peut y aller ?
- Non, on reste.
Papa, je dois y aller.
J'ai dit qu'on reste, Renaldo.
Qu'est-ce qui va pas ?
Non, non, je veux dire
"y aller".
On est dans la voiture
depuis trop longtemps.
Que tu fasses dans une allée
ou assis sur un trône
en porcelaine,
ça change pas grand chose, non ?
Dure journée ?
Ça n'aide pas
de se renfermer.
Qu'est-ce que vous en savez ?
Si tu me parles,
on pourra peut-être t'aider.
C'est rien.
Écoute, Albert. Tu travaillais
vraiment bien dans cette classe.
Vraiment bien jusqu'à aujourd'hui.
Essaie.
Je suis rentré hier.
Ma mère était sur le canapé.
Elle était morte.
Me-maw a dit que je dois
aller à l'école, mais...
Oui, tu voulais être
avec ta maman.
Bien sûr.
Certains me connaissent
par mon travail avec les Stupéfiants,
d'autres, auparavant, si vous avez
travaillé dans la zone ouest
et je rencontre certains de vous
pour la première fois.
Ce que je voudrais
vraiment dire aujourd'hui,
c'est que c'est une période
de transition
pour le département
et la ville toute entière.
Nous avons un nouveau maire
et un nouveau procureur général
qui pensent
avoir une mission de changement.
Étant donnée la position du maire
sur la criminalité
et les résultats des élections,
nous attendons des améliorations.
Vraiment ?
Certaines améliorations pourraient
survenir prochainement.
Nous souhaitons votre avis, votre opinion
sur ce dont nous avons besoin
en plus ou en moins
pour mieux travailler sur les meurtres.
- Une meilleure protection des témoins.
- Des enquêtes plus dynamiques.
Un meilleur salaire.
Oui !
- Un meilleur labo. Plus de techniciens.
- Plus d'heures sup.
Plus de Scotch !
Plus de temps de préparation
des affaires. Sérieusement.
Plus de femmes.
Des femmes faciles.
Une augmentation à deux chiffres.
Plus mieux, plus mieux.
C'est ce qu'on veut.
On dirait que c'est un nouveau jour.
Le département aura enfin
ce dont il a besoin.
Le bureau du procureur général aussi.
Un nouveau jour.
Ils forment un joli couple.
Je me réjouis de travailler
avec vous, Colonel.
C'est signé par le maire
qui est maintenant en place.
Il ordonne à la police
d'éviter les arrestations de masse.
La surveillance des quartiers
et la répression de haut niveau
doivent être privilégiées.
Je suppose que Burrell
en a reçu une copie.
En personne.
Je ne comprends pas.
Pourquoi ne pas virer
ce salopard ?
Le maire considère ses options.
Mais qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
Pour renvoyer Burrell,
nous aurons besoin
d'un capital politique plus fort.
Ce qui nous amène
à une autre petite affaire.
- L'incident avec le pasteur.
- C'est une situation délicate.
Les pasteurs insistent
pour un contrôle civil
dont je sais que les hommes
ne veulent pas,
mais cela vise directement
la situation avec Burrell.
Si nous dépensons notre capital
à défendre cet incident...
Je comprends.
Vous voulez faire virer le flic.
Non, nous ne disons
pas ça du tout.
Le maire ne veut pas se mêler
de la routine du département.
Mais c'est un numéro d'équilibre,
notre réaction doit être
intelligente et équitable,
dans le sens racial, surtout.
C'est une question de perception.
Exactement.
Les Enquêtes Internes
ont un commandant noir,
mais il a des obligations
envers Burrell.
Il va remuer la merde, s'il le peut.
Le sergent en question
est aux Enquêtes Criminelles.
Son nouveau commandant
est Daniels.
Il est intelligent, noir
et neutre politiquement.
- Ça marche pour vous ?
- Ça marche.
Qui c'est ?
J'ai dit : qui c'est ?
Tu rentres à la maison
ou tu fais que passer ?
Je rentre si je peux.
D'accord. Mets-toi près du feu
si tu veux.
Il me reste deux-trois saucisses.
T'as faim ?
Ça marche pas
avec Jo-Jo et ses gars.
Il a dit que je lui dois du fric
sur une vente d'un autre gars.
Mais je veux pas
faire d'histoire.
Ils te foutent la pression.
Tu sais...
mets-toi avec moi
et on les remboursera, d'accord ?
Non, toutes les conneries que tu m'as dites
me passent par la tête.
Oublie ça.
Oublie tout ça.
Si je t'avais pas poussé dehors,
t'aurais jamais été
au coin de la rue.
Mais dans tout ce que j'ai fait,
j'ai merdé.
Je pensais tout le temps
que j'avais pas ma place dans la rue.
Je voulais juste partir.
Mais t'es là maintenant.
C'est toi, ici et maintenant.
Tu vas faire un trou
dans ton t-shirt.
Merde...
Tu m'as chamboulé
quand je t'ai vu rentrer, Sherrod.
Oh, merde.
Qu'est-ce que t'en penses ?
Je la ferai à moitié prix.
Allez, enlève ton bonnet.
Brûle pas les saucisses.
Ça en a pris du temps !
Yo, Dukie, t'es sûr de ça ?
Je suis avec vous.
Vous êtes mes potes.
Vous êtes là pour moi
et je suis là pour vous.
Je commence à penser
que c'est une connerie.
L'Officier Walker
est un pauvre con
mais il est de la police.
Si on fait comme dit Michael,
on envoie un message.
Vous avez pas à faire
ce que j'ai à faire.
On a tiré à la courte paille, Na'.
On y va.
C'est tout ?
La déclaration du Sergent Hauk,
celle des pasteurs,
les déclarations des autres officiers...
tout est là.
Pas de témoins indépendants ?
Beaucoup de fumée
mais je ne vois pas
le feu.
C'était un exemple fort
de manque de courtoisie.
C'est vrai, mais pas d'insinuations
raciales ou religieuses.
Et l'accusation de brutalité
est un peu poussée.
J'ai regardé le règlement général.
Je connais bien
l'ensemble,
mais comme les décisions
m'incombent sur ceci,
présentez-moi mes options.
Pour des fautes mineures,
vous pouvez imposer
une période de travail
sans salaire,
séances avec un conseiller, etc...
Ou, si le Sergent Hauk
s'oppose à votre décision
ou s'il y a une accusation
plus grave,
ça passe devant un comité.
Et renvoi possible ?
Laissez-moi vous demander...
si le pasteur a des relations,
et si tous les regards
se portent sur ceci,
à quoi s'attend
le haut-commandement ?
Qu'est-ce que la Mairie attend ?
La Mairie veut seulement
que quelqu'un réagisse bien,
de quelque manière que ce soit.
Vous me dites, M. l'Adjoint,
de faire ce qu'il faut ?
Ça n'arrive pas souvent, je sais.
Hé ! Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Viens ici !
Petit salopard,
je vais t'attraper !
Allez, mains en l'air, salope.
Recule, petit con,
je suis policier.
Oui, je sais, tu es un policier qui aime
emmerder les négros. Tourne-toi.
T'entendras pas le suivant.
Mets-toi à genoux,
croise les jambes,
croise les mains, allez !
Oh, attends.
Mais qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Ça va pas, non !
Donne-moi cette bague, mec.
Allez !
Ouais.
C'est notre revanche.
C'est ça !
Filez, salopards !
Merde !
Service des Travaux Publics
Je te le dis,
ce cheval va gagner.
Regarde-le, d'accord ?
Comment ça va ?
- Hé.
- Excuse-moi.
M. le Maire.
En allant vers le centre-ville,
j'ai vu une voiture abandonnée.
Remorquez-la tout de suite.
Où est... M. le Maire,
à quel endroit ?
Nom de Dieu !
Appelez les Transports !
Mettez les camions en route !
Euh... M. le Maire.
J'ai eu l'appel d'une citoyenne.
Elle a dit que le terrain de jeu
près de chez elle est dangereux.
- Du métal rouillé.
- On s'en occupe tout de suite.
À quel endroit ?
Je dois savoir l'endroit.
M. le Maire, je comprends
votre souci, mais comprenez
que nous avons
plus de 9 100 bouches d'incendie.
Et l'une d'elles fuit.
Séances avec un conseiller,
deux semaines de travail
supplémentaire, pas d'autre punition.
Ils ont fait ça sommairement.
Daniels sait dans quelles difficultés
cela met son copain Carcetti ?
Wilson a briefé Rawls,
Rawls a briefé Daniels.
Carcetti joue les Ponce Pilate
en mettant ça sur le dos
de Daniels qui était un choix sûr
en ce qui concerne
la troupe.
Mais cela ne suffira pas
pour les pasteurs, d'aucune façon.
Je suis le seul à savoir
comment jouer à ce jeu ?
Allez, fermez cette bouche
d'incendie.
Trois d'entre eux
avec des pistolets
m'ont attaqué
devant le club.
Je pense que c'étaient des bloods.
La peinture jaune est
une déclaration de guerre.
On dirait qu'il va falloir
botter des fesses.
À la façon du quartier est.
La peinture jaune,
une déclaration de guerre ?
C'est nouveau, ça.
Ce que j'ai entendu,
c'est que ces sauvages...
Je dis pas de noms...
mais ils étaient fous.
Ils l'ont volé.
Ils lui ont jeté
de la peinture jaune.
Je mens pas.
Je n'en sais rien,
mais tu m'as montré quelque chose
en montant sur cette caisse.
C'était rien.
Non, ne te sous-estime pas.
Mlle Duquette,
M. Parenti,
on a tous pensé
qu'il fallait du courage,
surtout vu
votre comportement ensemble.
Vous trouvez ?
Oui.
Écoute, tu progresses
beaucoup en classe.
Tu le sais, n'est-ce pas ?
Tu travailles,
tu ne fais pas l'imbécile.
Tu pourras bientôt
retourner dans une classe normale,
sans problème.
Avec tout le monde ?
Vous voulez que j'y aille ?
Si tu es prêt.
Je n'y retournerai pas.
Pourquoi pas ?
Les conneries qu'ils enseignent
là-bas, c'est mortel.
Mais vous le savez,
mon Lapin.
D'accord, d'accord !
On peut prendre
un peu d'argent par-ci, par-là
mais rien à l'échelle
de ce que vous demandez.
On pourrait débloquer de l'argent
en faisant passer les projets PAYGO
dans le programme principal.
Je peux en prendre
du fond d'amortissement,
mais on doit absorber
120 dotations pour des postes
dans la police,
surtout des officiers.
Seigneur, ne laissez pas
ceux-là sans fonds.
Beaucoup de choses
sans parler du budget des écoles.
Et le surplus des revenus ?
Cet argent rentre une seule fois.
Si je donne 5% d'augmentation
à la police, c'est définitif.
Si je demande aux policiers
de se battre ardemment,
je dois apporter de l'argent.
Dites-moi comment.
Il y a le fonds d'urgence,
mais vous ne devriez pas le vider.
Les sociétés de garantie des bons
imposent une réserve de 5%.
Moi, je trouve que
c'est un cas d'urgence.
Et ça urge dur.
Yo, attends.
- Qu'est-ce que vous avez ?
- C'est pas toi, Mike ?
On veut dire un mot
à ton copain.
Rien t'en empêche, parle.
- Tu sais ce qu'on veut dire.
- La petite salope a parlé aux flics.
- C'est pas vrai. J'ai pas cafté.
- Sûr que si, putain !
On dirait qu'il va pisser
dans sa culotte.
Tu vas pas défendre un salopard
de cafteur ?
Non... je défends pas
les cafteurs.
Ces coussins chauffants
durent 18 heures.
On se couche, on se réveille
et c'est encore chaud.
Touchez celui-là
d'il y a trois heures.
Vous voyez ?
Deux pour le prix d'un.
Il y a deux coussins par paquet.
Achetez-en cinq, je vous en donne six.
Donne-m'en six.
Cinq.
Reste bien au chaud.
Merci bien, M'sieur.
Prends ce côté,
je prends celui-là.
Bubbles Depot.
Bubbles Depot a ce qu'il vous faut.
Je suis de retour.
Venez me voir.
Oh, regarde...
hé, Sherrod !
Qu'est-ce qu'y a ?
Une voiture a dû le renverser.
- Combien tu penses ?
- De l'aluminium ?
L'aluminium,
c'est 30-40 cents la livre.
Ça fera 100 $ facile, petit.
Le travail d'équipe rapporte
aujourd'hui, hein, petit ?
Prends le côté lourd.
Laisse-moi essayer.
Dégagez de là !
Ça suffit !
Fichez-moi le camp !
Ça suffit !
Arrêtez !
Randy, espèce de salope !
On en a pas fini avec toi, cafteur !
Allez, viens.
Faut croire que les livres
servent à quelque chose.
Appelez l'infirmière.
Yo, pourquoi ils m'ont attaqué ?
- J'suis pas un cafteur.
- C'est bon, Randy.
Merci beaucoup.
Chicken George a été fermé?
Non, j'ai dû venir
me planquer ici.
Tes gars sont déchaînés.
Vaut mieux pas être un bigleux
dans le quartier ouest aujourd'hui.
Vous avez du retard
dans vos quotas ou quoi ?
C'est quoi, tout ce bordel ?
Un de mes gars a été attaqué.
Ouais, Walker, j'ai entendu
parler de cette connerie.
Ils lui ont jeté de la peinture dessus.
Walker est un connard.
Hé, si on joue dans la saleté,
on se salit.
Parlez.
Cambriolage au 19 North Monroe.
Compris.
On devrait remettre ça.
Ne va pas faire des trucs suspects.
Sûrement pas.
Et vous, vous cassez pas un ongle.
M. P., j'ai juste dit à la police
ce que tout le monde sait.
J'suis un cafteur, alors, Michael ?
T'aurais rien dû dire à personne.
T'es pas un cafteur
si t'as pas dénoncé quelqu'un.
Seigneur, j'aurais dû arrêter ça.
C'est pas votre faute, M. P.
Tout ça est arrivé
à cause de ce que Tiffany a dit
de ce qui s'est passé dans les toilettes.
Qu'est-ce que tu leur as dit ?
Qu'est-ce qu'ils savent ?
J'ai dit que Lex était allé
au terrain de jeu derrière Fulton
et que tout le monde dit
qu'il a été tué
- et mis dans une maison condamnée.
- C'est tout ce que tu leur as dit ?
Ils voulaient que je dise
que j'y étais...
mais je leur ai juste dit
que le Petit Kevin me l'avait dit.
- Le Petit Kevin ?
- Il a été tué aussi.
Marlo l'a attrapé aussi.
Tout le monde dit ça.
Marlo Stanfield ?
J'ai entendu que Kevin
a été pris la semaine dernière,
et maintenant il est
dans une maison quelque part.
Ils l'ont mis
dans une maison vide aussi ?
Randy, pour le moment,
Michael a raison.
Si quelqu'un essaie encore
de te parler,
ne dis rien à personne,
compris ?
Ça arrangera les choses ?
En somme, Messieurs,
les dieux ont parlé.
Notre sort n'est plus lié
aux statistiques.
À partir d'aujourd'hui, nous ferons
des arrestations de qualité...
délits et infractions graves,
retour au travail de base
de nos saints ancêtres.
En vérité, ce serait plus facile
de faire tourner en rond
un tanker sur une mare.
Nos hommes ne connaissent
que les statistiques.
Si vous ne pouvez pas les plier
à cette mission, Eugene,
je trouverai quelqu'un
qui puisse le faire.
Messieurs.
Chef.
En accord
avec vos propositions,
je voudrais reconstituer
l'unité Criminelle,
et la placer sous la tutelle
des Homicides.
Laissez-moi deviner, vous voudriez
chambouler le personnel.
Là où c'est approprié.
Faites-le, Colonel.
- Quoi ?
- C'est malin d'accepter toutes les idées
quelles qu'elles soient
qui viennent du consacré.
Daniels.
Le prochain chef de police.
Pour que n'importe
quel branleur passe
de lieutenant à colonel
en un peu plus d'un an,
c'est qu'on le prépare
à quelque chose.
Vous n'avez pas pensé
un instant que...
Seigneur, Bill.
Nous sommes à Baltimore.
Vous n'êtes pas d'ici ?
Tu vois où ils sont allés ?
El gordo et le grand gars
sont allés dans une grande salle,
au premier étage.
Le panneau dehors dit :
"Coop du Nouveau Jour".
Coop ?
C'est quoi "coop" ?
"Coop du Nouveau Jour",
c'est ce que ça dit.
Il y a avait un trait
entre les deux O ?
C'est coopérative<i>..</i>
Prop Joe dans une coopérative ?
Joe est allé avec le gars
qu'on a volé.
Rappelle-toi,
il est tombé à genoux,
a pleuré
comme un petit bébé.
Oui, Fat Face Ricky.
Quelqu'un d'autre ?
Si, huit ou neuf autres
que j'ai jamais vus,
mais tout pareil pour moi.
Prop Joe s'est assis à la table.
Oh, dis donc.
Le vers a fait un tour complet.
Marlo.
Si c'est ce que je pense,
notre petit groupe de poules
pourrait bien
mettre tous leurs œufs
dans le même panier.
C'est bien ?
Muy bueno, petit.
Je sais une chose...
Je me promènerais pas
avec ça autour du cou
pour que Walker la trouve.
Il la trouvera pas.
T'es fou de prendre le risque.
S'il t'attrape avec ça,
il te cassera
autre chose que les doigts.
Qu'est-ce que t'as, mec ?
Ces jours-ci, t'es devenu...
comme si t'avais
enlevé ton masque.
C'est quoi ça ?
Si Walker a vu...
Il m'a pas vu.
Et le truc entre toi et Randy ?
Tout le monde dit
que tu t'es battu avec lui.
T'as tabassé Dimples et ses copains.
Yo, t'aurais pas réagi ?
C'est pas ce que je dis.
Il s'agit pas que d'agir,
il faut faire ça bien.
Yo, écoute je vais pas rester
comme ça
et laisser des connards
penser que j'ai peur.
J'ai pas peur.
Et alors ?
Et je veux que vous acceptiez.
Colonel, c'est une question de...
Vous vous trouvez incompatible
avec un certain lieutenant ?
Inspecteur Freamon,
vous avez carte blanche
pour choisir votre brigade.
Vous pourriez choisir
votre supérieur, ça m'est égal.
Mon salaud,
en ce qui me concerne,
vous êtes la Criminelle.
C'est un nouveau jour
à Baltimore, Lester.
Réveillez-vous.
Police de Baltimore
Quartier ouest
Des renforts ?
Carver.
Qu'est-ce qui te ramène
au bercail ?
J'ai eu confiance en toi, en Daniels.
Et je me suis trompé.
Attends.
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?
Le gosse que vous deviez protéger,
vous avez divulgué son nom.
Ils le tabassaient
devant l'école aujourd'hui,
le piétinaient parce qu'il a cafté.
- Il va bien ?
- C'est toujours la même chose.
J'aurais dû voir ça arriver !
Je te le jure, je ne sais pas
ce qui s'est passé.
J'ai branché le gosse
sur Bunk Moreland et Herc.
Je ne peux pas croire...
Où est le gosse maintenant ?
Chez lui.
Je vais informer
le commandant de nuit.
On mettra une unité en civil
devant la maison.
Tu crois que ça arrangera
les choses ?
On sera discret, on se mettra
plus loin dans la rue.
Viens à l'intérieur.
Je te jure, je saurai ce qui s'est passé.

- Ravi de vous rencontrer.
- Vous nous avez surpris, félicitations.
- Merci.
J'aimerais vous présenter
à Dorothy.
Vous avez entendu
parler d'Ed Nully ?
J'ai entendu du bien de ce que
vous faites, continuez.
Ravi que vous ayez pu venir,
M. le Maire.
C'est pour une bonne cause,
n'est-ce pas ?
J'ai le mauvais œil sur moi.
Je dois le faire circuler.
D'accord.
Par ici.
- À la prochaine fois.
- Portez-vous bien.

Les gens de Washington stimulent

et si l'esplanade du port
pouvait s'étendre
à la branche sud...
- Nous y réfléchissons.
- Il faudrait.
Tout, d'ici à Hanover Street,
c'est de l'argent.
M. le Maire, vous voulez jouer
un peu au poker ?
Je n'ai pas beaucoup de chance.
La chance peut tourner.
M. le Maire, je voudrais
vous présenter Ray Chandler.
Ravi de vous rencontrer.
Mon garçon, tu vas le faire,
sinon je le ferai.
C'est pour ça
que la police t'attrape toujours, Na'.
Alors, c'est l'eau de Cologne
de Bunk, hein ?
Oh... une bonne femme.
Tu vas me manquer aussi, salope.
Lester adore écouter
les conversations.
Il est un peu pervers.
Tu devrais le faire
de temps en temps...
pour élargir ton horizon.
Oh, non, non.
Le Bunk est un salopard
en costume-cravate.
En tout état de cause, un homme
doit sauver les apparences.
La dignité, je te le dis.
La dignité au-dessus de tout.
Gouverneur.
Oyez, oyez !
- Bunk, tu as une minute ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Wagstaff, le gosse
que je t'ai envoyé.
Wagstaff ?
C'est un des miens ?
Oui, vous cherchiez
Lex, le gars
qui a tiré sur quelqu'un
devant un night-club, il y a trois mois.
Le gosse savait que Lex
avait été tué.
Herc te l'a amené.
Herc ?
Ce gosse est un témoin
et Herc était censé
- me l'amener ?
- C'était prévu comme ça.
Je vais étriper ce salopard.
Putain, Herc.
Qu'est-ce que t'as foutu ?
Quelque chose est arrivé
à ce gosse ?
Jeune homme,
votre souhait se réalise.
Ça veut dire que je peux enfin
sortir d'ici ?
Oui, Monnel, les papiers ont mis
du temps à venir de North Avenue,
mais vous cinq
êtes à l'âge
où nous pensons
qu'il est dans votre intérêt
de rejoindre vos camarades
en classe de 4ème.
Yo, on est au lycée !
- On change quand ?
- À la fin du trimestre.
Félicitations.
Vous pouvez y aller.
M. Johnson, un visiteur
vous attend à l'accueil.
M. Johnson, veuillez venir
à l'accueil.
De mauvaises nouvelles ?
Plus encore.
Ils mettent fin
à votre programme.
Comme je l'ai dit
lors de chaque appel
dans chaque secteur, si je pouvais
obtenir plus, je le ferais.
Pour commencer, ce sera
5% d'augmentation, c'est sûr.
Je sais que vous méritez
bien plus
mais si les revenus restent bons,
vous aurez plus.
M. le Maire,
ma femme vous remercie,
mes enfants vous remercient,
mon chien vous remercie.
Santy, comment tu différencies
ta femme de ta chienne ?
Sa femme, c'est celle
qui a les puces.
Merde, Bobby,
avec ta bobonne,
des puces, ça serait un plus.
Repos.
Le maire est ici, Messieurs.
Quand ils restent enfermés,
ils deviennent bagarreurs.
Je ne prétendrai pas
savoir faire votre travail.
Je ne sais pas.
Mais je peux vous dire
que j'ai parlé à beaucoup
de vos collègues,
les représentants de votre syndicat
et de votre association
et la plainte majeure
que j'entends
concerne l'obsession du département
avec les statistiques.
Ce putain de jeu avec les chiffres.
Sous ma conduite, le jeu
des chiffres est terminé.
Vous n'aurez plus le couteau sous
la gorge pour respecter les quotas
d'arrestations inefficaces et inutiles,
et de contraventions.
Merci.
M. Le Maire.
Vous n'êtes pas le premier
qui a fait des promesses
sur ce podium.
Jimmy, le maire
a des affaires urgentes.
C'est bien gentil de critiquer
ce qu'on fait dans la rue,
mais on va pas se retrouver
avec des cadavres sur les bras ?
Nous devons apprendre
à nos citoyens à dire non.
Ce ne sont pas les seuls
qu'il faut éduquer.
On a des patrons qui savent
que dalle du travail de la police.
Ils gonflent les statistiques
depuis des années
et le referont à la première plainte.
Ils connaissent que ça.
Si les vieux loups
ne peuvent pas faire le boulot,
j'en trouverai d'autres
qui pourront le faire.
Pendant longtemps, assis
sur les bancs du conseil,
j'ai vu notre ville se détériorer.
C'était la routine
avec les mêmes vieilles idées
menant aux mêmes vieux résultats.
Je suis là maintenant
et vous demande
de mettre de côté vos réserves
et de tenter le coup.
C'est tout.
T'as été très bien.
Vous les avez encouragés.
Ils vous adorent.
Bien sûr, si vous prenez la mauvaise
décision pour le Sergent Hauk, qui sait ?
Carv a dit que le gosse
savait quelque chose. Je lui ai parlé.
Il ne savait rien,
à part des rumeurs
et des conneries sur les zombies.
Le gosse devait m'être amené.
Tu connais le règlement...
ça revient aux Homicides.
Tu peux pas mettre les pattes
sur mon affaire, pauvre crétin.
Hé ! Tu parles à un sergent.
Rien à foutre de tes galons !
Du calme, Bunk.
Herc essaie de nous aider.
Il a embrouillé mon affaire,
il va payer.
Donne-lui une chance.
On peut s'arranger.
Facile à dire.
T'es pas responsable de tout ça.
Salopard...
Qu'est-ce qui lui prend ?
Il est nerveux.
Il travaille sur cette affaire
depuis longtemps.
Alors maintenant,
tu dois te rappeler
tout ce que tu as fait
depuis le début
sur cette affaire.
Il est là dehors, la casquette
dans les mains, littéralement.
Il peut attendre
jusqu'à ce qu'à la saint-glinglin.
Un homme sage
ne brûle pas les ponts
avant de savoir qu'il peut
marcher sur l'eau.
Vieil adage Ashanti.
Norman, tu as grandi
à Catonsville.
Fais rentrer ce salopard.
M. le Maire,
je ne veux pas
vous faire perdre votre temps.
Si c'est parce que j'annule vos ordres
d'augmenter les arrestations...
Non, Monsieur. Vous devriez agir
selon la situation.
Les stratégies policières
ne sont peut-être pas mon point fort.
Je suis là à propos
de ce que je connais.
Une recommandation du commandant
du Sergent Hauk
sera sur votre bureau demain.
Le Colonel Daniels,
en accord avec Rawls,
recommande des séances
avec un conseiller.
C'est peut-être une décision juste,
c'est peut-être même
la bonne décision.
Mais nous savons tous deux
qu'elle ne plaira pas aux pasteurs,
pas même si elle provient
de Daniels.
600 pages de règles,
règlements, instructions, ordres.
Vous renvoyez un policier blanc
pour l'interpellation
d'un pasteur noir,
et vous perdrez la troupe.
La raison ne suffit pas. Mais si
un commandant ne peut pas trouver
de raisons pour renvoyer
un saint...
Cet homme est à la Brigade
des Stupéfiants depuis six ans
et aux Stupéfiants,
il n'y a pas d'anges.
Et votre expertise
se résume à ça.
Je n'ai jamais eu de scrupules
à déléguer les éléments stratégiques.
L'Adjoint est là pour ça.
Moi, je sais ce dont
un maire a besoin.
C'était une Chevy Tahoe.
Plaque minéralogique :
Mike-460-654.
Je l'ai bien fouillée en pensant
que je trouverais un flingue, mais...
Comment ont-ils réagi ?
Chris et Snoop ?
Ils ont rien fait du tout.
Il y avait quelque chose
dans la voiture ?
Les papiers et des conneries
dans la boîte à gants,
des boîtes de poulet vides,
des déchets.
Ils avaient une caisse en plastique
pour le lait...
...à l'arrière avec des outils dedans.
Quel genre d'outils ?
Je ne sais pas,
des outils de charpentier.
Pas d'armes dans la caisse ?
Un fusil à clous.
Un fusil à clous ?
Oui, un truc
qui tire des clous.
Ils l'avaient bricolé
pour tirer des balles, peut-être ?
Non, j'ai tiré.
Un clou est sorti.
Lester, sérieusement,
c'est utile tout ça ?
Tu fais bien de me dire tout ça.
Dis-moi comment tu as
repéré Marlo à la gare.
Il m'en manque quatre, c'est ça ?
Ouais, je me rappelle de toi, connard.
Voilà les quatre.
T'aimes ça ?
- OK.
- Je vais te botter le cul.
OK, ça suffit !
Arrête, arrête !
Prends l'argent, prends l'argent,
d'accord ? Arrête.
Si tu me fais encore travailler si dur,
je vous étripe tous les deux !
OK. Va-t'en.
Je suis désolé.
Je suis désolé, fiston.
Tu sais qui as le plus gros cul
et la meilleure chatte ?
- Qui donc ?
- Les naines.
Elles sont comme ça,
tu comprends ?
Qu'est-ce qui est arrivé
à notre gars à la porte ?
Tu peux réparer ça, Joe ?
C'est quoi le problème ?
Elle n'a pas plus le temps.
T'as été si occupé
à tes sournoiseries
que t'as fait des conneries
et tu t'es fait attraper dans un filet.
Omar, je ne sais pas ce
que t'as entendu, mais...
J'ai pas le temps
pour les mensonges.
Il faut
que tu sois franc,
comme tu l'as été à cette rencontre
de la Coop du Nouveau Jour.
Oui, je suis
au courant de ça.
C'est toi qui as foutu
Marlo dans cette connerie.
Omar, respire un bon coup.
Une proposition pourrait
t'intéresser.
Chatouille mon imagination,
gros bonhomme.
De l'argent, de la drogue...
comme tu voudras.
Tu peux faire
mieux que ça, Joe.
Hé, on peut s'arranger.
C'est toi qui as la meilleure carte.
Tu devrais dire ce que tu penses.
Tu vas me servir Marlo
sur un plateau.
Tu veux descendre
Marlo Stanfield ?
Non, non, mais j'ai
une forte envie
de prendre tout ce qu'il a,
et je suis sûr
que tu peux arranger ça.
Ça pourrait être difficile.
Non, non, on fera
les choses simplement.
Omar aime
que ce soit simple.
Comment on va faire ça, yo ?
Hein ?
Le fils de ma sœur.
Il fait la livraison.
On t'appellera
pour te dire où.
- C'est assez simple ?
- Tout à fait.
Joe, il faut que tu résistes
à ton inclinaison naturelle
à faire quelque chose
de tordu. Compris ?
Si je sens que tu fais
quelque chose de louche, Joe,
je devrais aller dire à Marlo
que c'est toi
qui m'as envoyé le plumer
pendant la partie de cartes.
Compris ?
Donne-moi un reçu
pour que je puisse partir.
Allez !
Messieurs.
Je vais m'occuper de Tremaine.
- Tu peux pas être sérieux
- T'as pas entendu ?
Omar d'un côté
tenant une bêche
et peut-être Marlo
de l'autre avec une pelle.
Et juste à ce moment,
j'ai réussi à grimper
hors de ma propre tombe.
Je n'y retournerai pas,
pas question.
Qu'est-ce que tu foutais là ?
T'as confiance en lui ?
- J'ai confiance en sa peur.
- On y va, si ?
Pas avant que je montre à Prop Joe
ce qu'est la sournoiserie.
On l'a.
Désolé, c'est tout ce que j'ai à dire.
Parlez à la mère.
Je comprends, mais nous avons vu
la mère de sa famille d'accueil
et vous lui auriez dit
de ne rien dire.
Vous lui auriez dit
de prendre un avocat.
C'est vrai.
Écoutez, quelque chose
a mal tourné.
On le sait, mais quoi qu'il soit
arrivé d'autre,
on a un meurtre.
Même si ce n'est pas officiel,
cela nous aiderait
de parler au gosse.
Si vous comprenez
ce qui s'est passé,
vous savez
que je ne ferai pas ça.
Si vous prenez ça comme ça,
vous êtes du côté des salopards
qui font ces saletés.
Non, je suis du côté
de mes gosses.
Vous avez raison.
Vous avez raison.
Pour vous, les gosses
passent d'abord.
Nous trouverons un autre moyen.
Content que ça marche pour vous.
Oh la la, vous deux...
vous me faites pleurer.
Faites attention à vous,
les gars.
D'accord.
Hé, Roland, écoutez,
je déteste
avoir fait tout ce chemin
sans récolter
un petit truc,
en souvenir
du bon vieux temps.
Le terrain de jeu
derrière le bloc d'habitation
au coin de Fulton et Monroe.
Il a dit à Lex
d'y retrouver une fille.
C'est tout ce qu'il a fait.
Ça va, Shorty ?
Tu peux m'en donner trois ?
Salope, traverse la rue
et va poser ton cul
là-bas.
Kenard !
Yo, comment tu me trouves
avec ma queue de cheval ?
J'ai l'air d'un pédé ?
Yo, Na'.
Yo, Mme Lee,
vous cherchez Michael ?
Namond, je veux pas
te déranger,
mais j'ai une amie
qui est malade
et elle m'a donné 6 $.
J'espérais que tu pourrais,
tu sais...
Oui, on la couvre.
Allez voir mon gars.
Pourquoi t'as fait ça, putain ?
C'est la maman de Michael, yo.
Merde, c'est une camée.
- Namond a dit que je pouvais. Na' ?
- Non, pas de problème.
Donne-moi de l'Oiseau Jaune.
D'accord, mais c'est pas
la peine de me coller.
Je sais, je sais !
Je suis en retard.
Parfois c'est sacrément amusant
d'être le chef.
T'étais où, patron ?
J'annonçais ma présence
avec autorité.
Désolé d'être en retard.
S'il vous plaît, asseyez-vous.
Nous avons ramassé
52 véhicules.
Bien.
Mais vous avez manqué le mien.
Nous avons installé
de nouveaux équipements à l'école 45,
l'école 52 et l'école 58.
On ne m'a pas appelé pour celles-ci,
mais vous y arriverez.
M. le Maire, toutes les bouches
d'incendie sont fermées
et les éboueurs
ont enlevé 32 tonnes de déchets
des allées, ce qui est un record
en un seul jour.
Voilà ce que je veux entendre.
Merci, Messieurs.
Continuez votre bon travail.
Les finances ne traitent pas
des éléments tangibles
de saleté sous les ongles
à moins qu'on considère
l'argent comme sale.
- Qu'y a-t-il à l'agenda ?
- Le contrôle des écoles.
C'est pas si terrible que ça.
L'académie est déficitaire
de 54 millions.
54 millions ?
Oui, M. le Maire.
Seigneur !
Royce savait ça ?
Merde, comment on règle ça ?
Franchement,
je n'en suis pas encore sûr.
Notre taux de présence
est excellent,
et quant aux renvois,
nous n'en avons pas.
Nous intervenons immédiatement
et réussissons à stabiliser
les comportements.
Sans mentionner tout le bien
que vous apportons aux classes
que ces gosses démolissaient
avant ce programme.
En janvier, nous pourrions
passer à quatre classes,
couvrir toutes les 3èmes.
Des plaintes sur le suivi,
- quelque chose des parents ?
- Pas une seule.
Ce n'est pas un groupe
où les parents interviennent beaucoup.
Et les résultats aux tests ?
Je ne peux pas parler
pour le programme lui-même
mais il doit profiter
au reste des 3èmes.
Nous le verrons
la semaine prochaine.
En ce moment, le système
est examiné de près.
Il y a des questions financières
inquiétant beaucoup
la nouvelle administration,
et ce que vous proposez
est un changement radical
des programmes.
Ce qui veut dire ?
Si la Mairie acceptait cela,
nous pourrions avancer
mais maintenant
n'est pas le moment
de faire des vagues.
T'entends ça ?
C'est ma chanson.
Alors, votre travail à tous
est à jour ?
Ouais, ouais, ouais.
J'ai entendu que t'as réglé
ton problème.
Ça, c'est le moins
qu'on puisse dire.
Tout va bien.
Tu sais, certains
des jeunes disent
que ton petit gars
a défendu un cafteur.
Michael ?
Ouais, c'est ce qu'ils disent.
Lester, tu commences
vraiment à me faire peur.
- Il me faut un pied de biche.
- Pour quoi faire ?
C'est une tombe.
Lex est là-dedans.
Oh...
merde...
Ah, non !
Merde.
Merde.
- Et maintenant ?
- Une balle dans la tête.
Je fais ça rapide.
Pas encore, connard.
Si tu tires aussi bien
avec un vrai flingue,
tu vas faire fureur, tu sais ?
Yo, on dirait vraiment
un Glock, ce flingue.
Ouais, c'est fait exprès.
Pourquoi tu tires si bas ?
Si t'es près de la cible, vise la tête.
Sinon, en bas du gilet.
C'est ce que tu nous as dit.
Il apprend vite, le petit.
SUR ÉCOUTE
"C'est tout ?"
- Tu entres dans celle-là aussi ?
- Je vais faire tout le pâté de maison.
T'as déjà arraché
le toit d'une maison
et trouvé un cadavre.
Alors, qu'est-ce que tu fous,
maintenant ?
- Je fais une expérience.
- Une expérience ?
Merde.
Il se prend pour Marie Curie.
Ce clou provient d'un pistolet à clous,
et il a été tiré de la maison
où se trouve le macchabée.
On trouve les clous des services
municipaux dans une maison sur deux.
Quand on les trouve dans un bout
de contreplaqué, où que ce soit,
ça veut dire
qu'il y a un cadavre à l'intérieur.
Dis donc, c'est pas bête.
Franchement, je suis impressionné.
Tu m'as bien regardé ?
Est-ce que je ressemble
à ces connards
qui se baladent au rayon outils
chez Castorama ?
Dans trois semaines,
c'est la fin de l'année,
et notre taux d'affaires classées
est au-dessous de 50%.
On ne cherche pas de cadavres,
surtout les connards méconnaissables
en état de putréfaction.
On ne met pas du rouge
sur le tableau par plaisir.
Jay, les cadavres sont
dans ces maisons.
Les cadavres de Marlo Stanfield.
Alors, ils sont à lui.
Je sais bien que tu ne fais plus partie
de mon équipe,
Inspecteur Poirot, mais tu fais
encore partie du service, non ?
Et c'est encore moi
qui commande ici, non ?
Alors, je te donne un ordre, Lester.
Tant que je ne reçois pas
d'ordre d'en haut
et tant que personne
ne te dit le contraire,
je te le répète,
arrête de démolir
ces putains de baraques !
Laisse couler.
Bon, il est vrai que je m'attends
à un manque à gagner
quand je regarde le budget de l'école.
C'est normal.
Mais comment on peut perdre
54 millions de dollars ?
Un million à la fois.
Parfaitement.
Ça ne s'est pas fait en un jour.
Ça s'est fait sous l'œil de Royce.
Et vous n'avez rien vu venir pendant
la réunion de bilan du conseil ?
Le conseil et Royce n'y sont pour rien
dans les histoires de budget.
C'est le comité directeur
qui a la responsabilité fiscale.
Mais le conseil a un droit de regard.
Ne me mets pas cette merde sur le dos.
On ne voit que l'apport de la ville
dans notre bilan budgétaire.
On ne voit pas apparaître
l'argent de État
Tu ferais bien de dire
à ton nouveau chef du personnel
que ce qui se passe sur North Avenue
dépend du système éducatif.
- Je trouve cette vision assez simpliste.
- Vous voulez la compliquer ?
En tant que président du comité, je dis
que c'est une question de comptabilité.
On a tout simplement reporté
la dette depuis 1999.
On l'a reportée, encore et encore,
jusqu'à ce qu'on n'ait plus d'argent.
Ce n'est pas de la comptabilité,
c'est de la bêtise.
Alors, de quoi s'agit-il ?
Gaspillage ?
Fraude ? Détournement de fonds ?
Je dirais que malgré la médiocrité
des pratiques comptables du système,
on finira par découvrir
que la plupart de l'argent
a été dépensé à bon escient
dans les programmes.
D'accord, j'ai compris.
Personne n'est responsable.
Ni le comité directeur de l'école,
ni les gens de North Avenue,
ni Clarence Royce,
ni le conseil municipal,
ni personne à cette table.
Bien. Alors, qu'est-ce qu'on fait,
maintenant ?
On augmente la taxe foncière ?
On réduit notre budget.
Plus d'augmentations, on n'embauche
plus et on réduit les services.
Dites-le à tout le monde : écoles, police,
pompiers, travaux publics...
Ils doivent tenir pendant un an ou deux.
Comment ?
Je viens de faire campagne
sur le thème du nettoyage.
Je viens de promettre monts et
merveilles à tous les flics de la ville.
Annapolis.
Va lécher son cul de Républicain.
Cheese est tout seul.
C'est le signal ?
J'espère pas, parce qu'ils ont pas
encore appelé.
Ça me fait de la peine
pour le vieux Prop Joe.
Ouais, faites le tour,
qu'on puisse tous vous voir.
Sympa, votre piaule. Intime.
Merde, vous êtes tous
étudiants à la fac ou quoi ?
Je peux m'inscrire ?
Voilà 25 à rendre à Joe,
c'est pour le rembourser.
Et en plus, 150
pour une commande de six.
On avait prévu quatre, pour vous.
Je ne sais pas
si on doit en recevoir d'autres.
Prends-les à quelqu'un d'autre.
Je vais voir ce qu'en pense Joe.
Ouais.
Quand on aura réapprovisionné
la marchandise, on t'avertira.
On mettra la came à l'endroit indiqué
une demi-heure plus tard.
- Yo, on n'utilise plus ça.
- Nous non plus.
On va t'appeler d'une cabine du
quartier est, pas besoin de répondre.
Tu le jettes, et tu vas au rendez-vous.
On se verra quand on se verra.
Le fric sur la table,
et ensuite on allonge la poudre.
On continue avec Marlo ?
Non, on va suivre Cheese.
Pourriez-vous m'ouvrir la porte,
Inspecteur ?
La vie nous fait parfois
des cadeaux, hein ?
Il allait m'enculer, et au lieu de ça,
c'est lui qui se fait sortir.
J'ai le cul bordé de nouilles.
Je suis un putain de veinard.
Messieurs,
notre cible est toujours Stanfield,
et à voir comment vont les choses,
on n'est pas plus près de le coffrer
qu'il y a deux mois.
Ils ne me laisseront peut-être pas
enquêter sur les meurtres,
mais ils ne peuvent pas m'empêcher
de poursuivre les dealers.
Leander, je veux
que tu surveilles ces gars.
Vois s'ils utilisent toujours
des portables.
Tu en es où, avec tes paperasses ?
- Ça va.
- Je veux que tu ailles à la mairie
et que tu examines tous les achats
de plus de 100 000 $
effectués dans le quarter ouest.
Ensuite, tu vas aller à la préfecture
pour voir s'il a des voitures de luxe
immatriculées à son nom.
Il trafique depuis un moment,
maintenant.
Il pourrait essayer
de blanchir de l'argent.
Herc, je veux que tu t'occupes
de la paperasse,
et que tu récupères le matériel d'écoute
que Marimow a envoyé
au département éducation.
On va avoir besoin de tout ça,
d'accord ?
Si quelqu'un me cherche,
je descends au bureau
des personnes disparues, d'accord ?
On y va.
- Lester ?
- Oui ?
C'est bien joli tout ça...
Mais tu crois qu'on peut faire en sorte
que l'ordre vienne de moi ?
Après tout, c'est moi qui commande ici.
Donut, comment tu me trouves ?
Pourquoi tu te fais des tresses ?
Pour que la police
me repère pas si facilement.
Ouais, mais maintenant, tout ce qu'ils
ont à faire, c'est dire : "Tiens, va par là
et attrape le petit négro
aux tresses".
Merde, c'est à cette heure-ci
que tu te pointes ?
Ça fait des plombes que je suis ici
à regarder l'argent qui file.
Aujourd'hui, c'est congé.
Quelqu'un a pris le paquet.
Quoi ? À l'arrière de ta cave ?
Ils ont défoncé ma putain de porte.
C'est comme ça qu'ils font.
Mais attends, comment les flics
pourraient savoir
où tu caches ton stock ?
Parce qu'un connard m'a balancé,
voilà comment.
Et je vais le trouver, tu peux me croire.
Bon, je m'arrache.
J'ai jamais compris pourquoi tu avais
arrêté de manger du cochon.
J'ai pas mangé
chez Polack Johnny's depuis 1974,
et si tu sais
ce qui est bon pour ta santé...
Je sais ce qui est bon, et à une époque
tu le savais aussi.
Je savais pas
que t'étais devenu musulman.
C'est pas ça,
mais je pense que d'autres religions
connaissent mieux le cochon que
nous autres, méthodistes africains.
Tu vois ?
Si tu le voulais,
je pourrais t'en parler un peu.
Non, j'ai rien à voir avec ça.
J'adore les saucisses, mais
c'est vrai que j'ai du mal à les digérer.
Si j'ai bonne mémoire,
il faut prendre la sauce d'origine,
pas la choucroute et le chili.
C'est pas la choucroute
qui me fait mal.
Le ministère est prêt
à supprimer tout programme
qui n'est pas relié aux tests État
Alors qu'on commence
enfin à avancer.
- T'en as parlé à la direction ?
- Oui, je suis monté avec le prof
- pour voir le surveillant général.
- Et ?
T'as pas lu les journaux ?
Ils sont occupés à essayer de se sortir
de cette affaire de budget.
Ils ont un trou de 50 millions,
et ils ont peur
d'annoncer d'autres problèmes
au nouveau maire.
- C'est un problème, ton truc ?
- Ça dépend comment on voit la chose.
Si on voulait couvrir nos arrières,
on pourrait dire
qu'on ne fait que repérer les élèves
qui ne s'en sortent pas,
et on leur fait passer des examens qui
n'apparaissent pas dans le système.
Si la mairie dit qu'on peut le faire,
on garde le programme.
Sinon, on est à la rue.
Odell Watkins.
J'espérais justement
t'entendre dire ce nom.
Oui, Carcetti l'écoute.
Si on arrive à le convaincre, on arrivera
peut-être à convaincre la mairie.
Torture-le, ce négro,
c'est lui qui a piqué tes trucs.
- Ouais.
- Dès qu'il piquera du nez,
tu lui éclates la tête
avec une brique ou autre.
Non, c'est pas mon style.
Tu peux lui faire
une petite injection, alors.
Vous vous souvenez de Junior Bunk ?
Il coupait sa came avec...
Comment ça s'appelle, déjà ?
Il avait piqué ça
aux Pompes Funèbres.
Tu veux dire du formol.
C'est ça.
Dès que les mecs
ont goûté à cette merde,
il a fallu créer un service infirmerie
spécial "Junior Bunk".
Mon cousin y est passé
deux ou trois fois, ce connard.
Mais on peut pas être sûr
à 100% avec ce truc.
Alors, utilise du poison à rat.
Non, c'est pas facile à chauffer.
Alors, il te faut du cyanure.
- Ça y ressemble et ça chauffe pareil.
- Où je peux trouver ça ?
Essaie d'aller voir Minter,
vers la voie ferrée,
ou alors, va chez un métallo
qui fait du placage.
- Il m'en faut combien ?
- Pas beaucoup.
Avec une fiole de ce truc,
tu pourrais tuer tout le monde ici.
- C'est tout ?
- C'est pas grand chose de tuer un négro
qui passe déjà son temps
à s'autodétruire.
Et puis, la police
en a rien à foutre.
Le seul truc, c'est qu'il va falloir
que tu vives avec.
Il y a plus de jeunes hommes
que je n'aurais pensé.
J'imagine qu'ils ne sont pas tous
partis à l'aventure.
T'as pu faire un peu de travail
de terrain sur ces dossiers ?
Tu te fous de moi, Lester ?
Depuis cinq ans, il n'y a qu'un seul
inspecteur pour toutes les disparitions.
J'arrive à peine
à mettre à jour la paperasse.
Je t'en prie.
Fais des copies et rends-moi
les originaux pour le dossier.
Pour le dossier...
D'accord.
Ça craint.
Kenard dit que
c'est la police qui a pris la came ?
Il dit qu'ils ont défoncé sa porte.
Et ils ont embarqué personne ?
Yo, t'as vu la porte ?
Les gonds étaient cassés ?
Enfin, s'il dit qu'ils l'ont défoncée
à coups de pied...
les gonds doivent pendouiller.
Je l'ai bien observé, yo.
Il essayait pas de m'embrouiller.
Ce petit enfoiré a pris
la came pour lui.
Je te parie que j'ai raison.
Et maintenant, tu dois aller le voir,
et tu dois tirer
cette affaire au clair.
Il est où, ton petit espagnol ?
Il est en poste avec Cheese
pendant que je rameute mes soldats.
Ils sont là, tes soldats.
Le juge a dû être content, quand tu as
utilisé la motion 2255, hein ?
Assez content
pour me renvoyer chez moi, non ?
Butch, je sais qu'ils savent se battre,
mais je voulais essayer
d'être un peu plus subtil, cette fois-ci.
Tu me comprends ?
Pour qu'ils me voient pas arriver.
C'est pas ton genre,
de travailler avec des inconnus.
Je célèbre la diversité.
Je me dis que
c'est le bon moment pour le faire.
Quoi de neuf, ma petite ?
Ça va, mon chou ?
- Dis donc, t'es superbe.
- Je me maintiens.
- Merde, tu m'étonnes.
- Tu vas bien ?
Ouais.
Ça fait longtemps.
J'ai eu ton message. Y'a du fric
à se faire sur ce coup-là, hein ?
Tu te souviens comment on fait ?
J'imagine que ça me reviendra.
Voilà ce que je voulais dire, Butch...
subtil.
Les verres d'abord,
pour éviter les traces.
Oui.
- Bonjour.
- Ho, M. Prezbo.
- Entrez, s'il vous plaît.
- Non, ça ira.
Je voulais juste passer
en rentrant chez moi
et déposer les devoirs de Randy
pour la semaine prochaine.
J'espère que ce sera bientôt fini,
cette histoire.
C'est possible, mais on pense
le mettre à Booker T. Washington,
le semestre prochain.
J'espère que ce ne sera pas
nécessaire.
Moi aussi.
Enfin, merci d'avoir amené ça.
J'essaierai de le maintenir à niveau.
- Tiens bon, petit.
- Merci.
Il est long,
cet appel en conférence.
Si ma montre est juste,
ça fait une heure.
Il m'a fait venir à fond de train.
Malheureusement,
l'appel du gouverneur
dure plus longtemps que prévu.
Vous voulez quelque chose ? Un café ?
Écoutez, j'ai d'autres rendez-vous.
Ce devrait bientôt être fini.
Regarde la chronique
de Fisher dans la section Metro.
D'après lui, et je cite,
le gouverneur pense que :
"La récente urgence fiscale
met en question
la capacité d'autogestion
du système éducatif de Baltimore,
ainsi que la supervision locale
de ce système",
fin de citation.
Enfoiré.
C'est pour flatter
les banlieues de Washington.
Il te voit venir pour lui prendre
sa place dans deux ans.
Il est pas bête.
Voici toutes les demandes
effectuées en ligne.
C'est quoi ça, un flic ?
Non, un vigile.
Mais c'est pas
un des gars de Marlo.
Inspecteur.
Est-ce que quelqu'un pourrait
m'expliquer ce bordel ?
D'abord, on me relègue au standard,
et puis je reçois
un coup de fil ce matin...
Ça avance, votre maison sur la plage ?
Elle est presque finie.
J'ai juste besoin d'un stock de bois...
Super, c'est super.
Bienvenue, bon retour.
C'est qui, ça ?
Ça, Sergent Hauk...
C'est un des supérieurs
les plus efficaces
de notre commissariat.
BUREAU DU GOUVERNEUR
Désolée. Ça prend plus de temps
que nous ne pensions.
Ce devrait être bientôt fini.
Je comprends ce que vous dites.
Certains parmi ces gamins
sont prêts pour le lycée,
mais pas Duquan.
- Je l'ai...
- ... Adopté ?
J'ai observé un changement
chez Duquan, ce semestre.
Il est mieux nourri, il porte
des vêtements plus propres.
Parfois, il sent même le savon.
Vous n'avez pas d'enfants,
votre femme et vous ?
- Pas encore, non.
- Hé bien, faites-en un.
Ils sont à vous pour la vie,
pour le meilleur et pour le pire.
Les élèves de cette école
ne sont pas à vous.
Faites votre travail avec eux,
et laissez-les partir.
Il y en aura des tas d'autres
après Duquan,
et ils auront aussi
besoin de votre aide.
Votre troisième classe commence
dans cinq minutes, non ?
On se calme.
Il faut qu'on se concentre
sur les tests.
- Non, ça m'emmerde.
- "Si le père de Jane
donne à Jane
une semaine d'argent de poche..."
Merde, j'ai pas
d'argent de poche, moi.
J'ai pas de père non plus.
Combien de côtés a un hexagone ?
Qu'est-ce que ça peut me foutre ?
Il faut réussir cet examen
pour passer au niveau supérieur.
- Je veux sortir de cet endroit de merde.
- Tu m'étonnes.
Bien, on se calme.
Commençons par la première question.
On se calme !
Bon, écoutez-moi.
Voici le problème qui est posé :
deux couples vont au restaurant.
- Ils demandent l'addition.
- Quand ils parlent de "couples",
- ils veulent dire qu'ils sont mariés ?
- On est obligé de se marier ?
M. Prezbo,
pourquoi les gens se marient ?
Hé bien, d'abord,
pour construire une vie ensemble...
Tu sais, une famille.
- Et pour avoir une intimité.
- Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ?
- Ça veut dire baiser.
- Non, ce n'est pas seulement ça.
L'intimité, ça peut être aussi
une conversation tranquille.
Ou alors, ça peut vouloir dire s'amuser.
Par exemple, se faire des chatouilles.
Yo, chatouille mes burnes.
Bien, ça suffit.
Bon, si on revenait aux tests ?
L'examen officiel a lieu
la semaine prochaine.
Ensuite, nous reviendrons
au programme régulier du cours.
Est-ce qu'on pourra parler d'intimité ?
Si vous voulez,
et si je ne suis pas trop gêné.
Donc, la somme totale
de l'addition
est de 67,40 $, mais s'ils veulent
laisser un pourboire...
Regardez votre feuille,
s'il vous plaît.
Je dois dire, Mlle Duquette, j'ai
l'impression que vous nous avez eus.
Ce cours est le même que celui
qui a lieu plus loin dans le couloir.
Ouais, c'est parce que
le test approche.
Bien, regardons
l'exemple du test de maths.
Dans l'exemple A, on commence par...
Ce gamin a raison.
C'est n'importe quoi.
Le contenu du test ne reflète pas
le monde qu'ils connaissent.
Ouais, ça ne me parle pas
beaucoup non plus.
C'est une estimation, Inspecteur.
Si on commence
à ouvrir ces maisons,
on pourrait se retrouver
avec quelques douzaines de corps,
enfin c'est une supposition.
Ce sont tous des meurtres ?
Ce gamin contrôle
la moitié du quartier ouest.
On n'a jamais vu
d'affrontements là-bas.
Voilà la raison.
Vous nous demandez d'annuler
la moitié des travaux publics
et de retirer le contreplaqué
de milliers de maisons vides,
tout ça pour augmenter le taux
de criminalité de la ville de 10% ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait d'autre,
avec Stanfield ?
J'essaie d'obtenir les numéros
de portables de ses lieutenants
aussi vite que je peux.
Et j'ai commencé à tracer son argent.
Mais si j'ai raison,
il faut approfondir la question.
Est-ce qu'il y a un lien entre tous
ces cas de personnes portées disparues
et l'organisation de Stanfield ?
Je commence à peine mon enquête
là-dessus. Le corps
qu'on a retiré de la maison
de l'Avenue Fulton, c'est Lex.
Il a un rapport direct avec lui.
Et il y a deux autres noms sur ces cas
de personnes portées disparues
qui figurent sur les écoutes qu'on a
faites plus tôt dans l'année.
Alors, oui, il y a des liens.
Par hasard, est-ce que Landsman
a fait remonter le message
jusqu'à vous ?
Non.
À vous de voir.
Mon bureau ne s'y intéressera
que s'ils voient des dossiers.
Je vais en parler à la direction,
et on verra ce que ça donne.
- D'accord, j'ai compris.
- Il n'est toujours pas disponible,
mais ça ne devrait plus tarder.
Pouvez-vous dire au gouverneur
que je dois retourner à Baltimore ?
J'ai quelques petites choses
à faire, aujourd'hui.
Je suis le maire d'une grande ville
américaine, enfin.
Il va m'en faire baver
encore longtemps ?
Si tu étais à sa place, tu jouerais aussi
sur le plan politique, non ?
Ce n'est pas comme si État n'avait
joué aucun rôle dans l'histoire.
Personne ne surveillait l'argent
que État donnait à ces écoles.
Mais je ne suis pas là,
à raconter à ce putain de journal
qu'il va peut-être être obligé
de me sortir du pétrin, parce que...
C'était quoi, la citation, déjà ?
Parce que "Les enfants de Baltimore
sont aussi mes enfants".
Il va me saigner
pour obtenir cet argent.
M. le Maire ?
Le bureau du gouverneur m'indique
qu'il est prêt à vous recevoir.
54 millions, c'est un gros chiffre.
On ne partira pas tant qu'on n'aura pas
obtenu ce qu'on veut...
Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait de mal ?
J'ai rien fait.
Tu es prêt.
Tu peux le faire.
Je sais que tu peux le faire.
Et si tu as besoin de revenir ici
pour utiliser la douche,
me donner ton linge à laver,
ou utiliser l'ordinateur,
tu peux le faire quand tu veux.
Bon, je vais vous montrer.
Voici comment
on accède au disque dur.
Je n'en ai pas besoin, Duquan.
C'est juste au cas
où je serais occupé, M. P.
Pour que vous sachiez vous en servir.
Salut, mon gars. Ça roule ?
C'est une grande journée pour toi.
Tu vois ça ?
J'ai réparti l'inventaire entre nous deux.
Tu prends la voie unique en remontant
vers North Avenue...
Et moi, je reste près de l'autoroute.
Tu vas me laisser
m'occuper du fric tout seul ?
- T'es prêt, non ?
- Ouais, ça va.
Bon, allons-y.
On se voit ici ce soir.
D'accord.
Hé, si tu vois cet enculé,
tu lui files son argent, compris ?
Pas la peine de l'emmerder.
- D'accord.
- Bon.
Et fais en sorte
que le compte soit bon !
Yo, faut que je parle
à ce petit con.
Tu peux peut-être y aller avec moi,
pour éviter que les choses dégénèrent.
Hé ! Yo, Mike !
Quoi de neuf, Duke ?
J'ai entendu dire que la mère adoptive
de Randy allait l'enlever de Tilghman
pour l'envoyer ailleurs.
C'est moche, ça.
Bon, à plus.
Combien ?
L'inspecteur Freamon a une théorie.
Il croit qu'il pourrait y avoir
d'autres cadavres dans ces bâtiments
vides. Peut-être une douzaine ou plus.
- "Il croit" ?
- Lester Freamon n'a pas l'habitude
de faire du bluff.
En tous cas, moi,
je ne parierais pas contre lui.
Et vous me suggérez de faire quoi,
avec ces informations ?
Je pense
qu'on devrait mettre
la mairie au courant.
Si on sort les corps avant le Nouvel An,
ça va gonfler les chiffres
de la dernière année de Royce.
En fait, ça arrangerait Carcetti
par rapport au taux de criminalité.
- Vous voulez dire...
- Dites au maire que c'est maintenant
qu'on doit vider ces maisons, et pas
l'an prochain quand il sera responsable
et qu'il se prendra
les chiffres en pleine gueule.
Colonel, je vois
que vous avez tout calculé,
sur un plan politique, je veux dire.
- J'apprends sur le tas.
- Sans blague.
Colonel, gardez cette conversation
confidentielle.
C'est un ordre direct.
T'as vu comment sont les filles
à Douglass ?
Yo, t'as raison, Duke.
On va passer aux choses sérieuses.
Tu sais, je me disais, yo...
Ah non, ça recommence.
Où ils sont ?
Tu veux récupérer des trucs ?
J'ai rien à récupérer.
Écoute, vieux.
On a notre coin maintenant,
Bug et moi,
alors tu peux venir squatter avec nous,
si tu veux.
Comment ça,
Kenard a pris la came ?
Et il vit encore ?
Je vais lui parler, Maman,
ça n'arrivera plus.
Regarde-moi, mon garçon.
Kenard doit être puni
pour ce qu'il a fait.
- Il le faut.
- Je ne...
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a, petit con ?
C'est comme ça que tu me remercies
de tout l'amour que je t'ai donné ?
Merde, je t'achète des Nike
depuis que tu portes des couches.
- Je fais ce que je peux.
- Ah ouais ?
C'est ce que tu vas dire à ton père,
la prochaine fois que tu le verras,
que tu fais ce que tu peux ?
Ou est-ce que tu vas lui dire
ce que tu as fait ?
Il s'est fait mettre au trou, lui...
Exact. Wee-Bey est arrivé
à Jessup en homme,
et il en sortira un homme.
Mais toi, tu es en liberté,
tu portes son nom,
et tu te comportes
comme une tapette !
Regarde ça, tu pleures, en plus.
Tu vas où, petit enfoiré ?
Ramène ton cul par ici.
J'ai pas fini.
Je fais partie de la police, non ?
De la police judiciaire,
et j'ai des cadavres sur les bras.
Est-ce que je suis censé
les laisser traîner ?
"On ne remplit pas sciemment
ce tableau de rouge".
Ce gros con de John Goodman
a été clair là-dessus.
- Alors, passe outre Landsman.
- C'est ton style, Jimmy.
Envoyer un fax anonyme. Mais tu vois,
Lester n'apprécie pas les bateaux.
Et moi, j'ai le mal de mer
même dans ma baignoire.
C'est moche.
Ouais, ça m'a fait le même effet quand
j'ai vu J-Lo avec ce minus espagnol.
Un vrai génie. Il a caché
son mausolée dans le quartier.
Comment il va remplir ça,
le petit Pedro ?
Dis donc,
elle est bien roulée cette nana.
- Et elle a bon cœur.
- Ouais, bien moelleux.
Ce clou, c'est leur signature.
Si t'en vois un sur une porte
du quartier ouest,
tu peux être sûr de trouver
un cadavre au même endroit.
Oui, Monsieur. Je suis fier d'être à la
poursuite de M. Marlo Stanfield.
Mon vieux, on dirait que tu es
sur les traces de Pol Pot.
- Qui ?
- Enfoiré, je te parie 10 $
qu'on peut partir
tout de suite et entrer
dans n'importe quelle maison
condamnée
qui a un clou comme ça
dans la porte,
et on trouvera un cadavre.
- Mettons 20 $.
- Ça marche.
Bon, mais avant, on se remet
une tournée. T'en veux un, Jimmy ?
- Non, merci.
- Oh, allez.
Enlève ta jupe
et bois un verre, bon Dieu.
Bois ça.
Fais pas le con, vieux.
Hé, yo, Kenard.
Pourquoi tu m'as menti ?
Qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?
Tu m'as dit que la police
avait défoncé ta porte.
J'ai vu la porte.
Personne a rien enfoncé.
- Pourquoi tu mens ?
- Arrête, mon pote.
- Yo, il est où, le paquet ?
- Va te faire voir, bouffon.
- Je vais...
- Tu vas quoi ?
Allez, trace,
sale crétin de ta mère.
Regarde, le petit gars qui est en train
de se faire dérouiller !
Tu parles trop.
Allez, Na'.
Reprends ton paquet à cet enfoiré
et on se barre.
J'en veux pas.
J'en veux pas.
Je veux bien mes 20 $, Bunk.
J'y vois rien dans ce merdier.
Ah, tu sais, je pourrais
prendre mon portefeuille,
et sortir 25 $ par erreur.
Il me faudrait des billets en Braille.
Vous voulez bien appeler
le labo, les filles ?
Non, mon vieux.
Je suis comme Stevie.
Tu sais que je supporte mal les crimes.
Il n'y aura pas de crime,
puisqu'il n'y aura pas de cadavre.
Enfin, pas avant que le chef ne décide
qu'il y en ait un. Et là,
tu rateras le moment
le plus drôle, petit.
Tu sais que Daniels
ne lâchera pas le morceau.
Les cravateux vont se démerder pour
faire foirer le truc. Tu le sais, Lester.
Peut-être pas cette fois-ci.
Daniels fait partie de l'armée.
Un nouveau jour se lève sur cette ville.
Je peux conduire.
On doit vraiment être mal
si Jimmy McNulty
est le plus qualifié pour conduire.
Ouais, je confonds le haut et le bas,
le noir et le blanc, la gauche et la droite.
Alors, voyons ça.
- Une nuit calme.
- Cool.
La relève sera là après l'appel.
C'est le Sergent Carver.
Comment ça va, petit ?
La nuit fut calme.
Tu vas à l'école, ce matin ?
On va attendre encore
un peu pour être sûr,
mais je ne me sens pas très à l'aise
d'aller travailler tous les jours
et de le laisser là.
Dans une semaine,
ce sera fini, vous verrez.
En attendant,
on a toujours une voiture à disposition
et vous avez mon numéro de portable
s'il se passe quelque chose.
On te protège.
- Vous avez déjeuné, Sergent ?
- Non, mais je dois...
Je suis sûr
que vous avez le temps de manger.
Bien sûr.
Yo.
J'ai fait un rêve qui m'a donné une idée.
Hé, Sherrod.
Tu te souviens quand on a bougé
ce lampadaire qui s'était écroulé ?
On s'était fait 80 $ ?
Je me disais qu'on pouvait en abattre
quelques uns nous-mêmes,
faire un peu le bûcheron, tu vois ?
On fera ça discrètement.
On n'en abattrait qu'un ou deux
dans des rues tranquilles,
pour que les gens
puissent continuer à être éclairés.
Le truc est que j'ai un autre truc
à faire aujourd'hui.
Allez, Sherrod. Réveille-toi.
Il est tard.
Non, non !
Qu'est-ce que t'as foutu ?
Qu'est-ce que t'as foutu ?
Allez, Sherrod.
Allez, vieux.
T'étais pas censé faire ça !
C'est pas vrai !
- Pas de téléphone ?
- Pas un seul.
Et les gars qui s'en servaient avant...
Chris, Monk, Ray-Ray...
Ils étaient là, au coin.
Je l'aurais vu si quelqu'un avait utilisé
un téléphone jetable.
Merde !
Si on avait continué les écoutes
il y a deux mois,
on serait pas dans cette m...
Vous désirez ?
Lequel d'entre vous est
le Sergent Hauk ?
C'est moi.
Je m'appelle Shea. Voici Thomas,
enquêtes internes.
J'aimerais savoir
si vous vous souvenez
avoir enlevé une caméra
de surveillance du district scolaire,
numéro de série AW466J9.
Ça vous dit quelque chose ?
Il faut aussi qu'on revoie les dossiers
que vous avez fait
sur quelques informateurs,
alors si vous voulez bien venir
au centre-ville avec nous,
vous...
l'inspecteur Sydnor et le troisième type,
comment s'appelle-t-il ?
Dozerman.
Pas besoin de Sydnor ni de Doze.
Les dossiers sont à moi.
Pour la caméra,
les informateurs,
c'est moi le responsable.
Des corps ? Combien ?
Peut-être un certain nombre. On ne le
saura pas avant d'enfoncer les portes.
Et c'est une bande de trafiquants
de drogue qui a fait ça ?
C'est notre théorie, mais
pour le moment rien n'est certain.
Ce qui est sûr, c'est que si on fait ça,
il est préférable pour vous de le faire
tout de suite, avant la nouvelle année,
pendant que l'augmentation
du taux de criminalité
peut encore être mis
sur le dos du maire Royce.
C'est fort judicieux.
Je ne veux plus que votre service joue
avec les chiffres des statistiques.
Faites entrer vos hommes dans
ces maisons, parce que s'il y a des corps,
il faut les faire sortir.
Et tout de suite.
Je ne veux plus trouver de corps
après le mois de janvier.
Oui, Monsieur.
On n'a pas le choix :
on prend l'argent de État,
et au lieu d'être délabrées et pauvres,
nos écoles seront toujours délabrées,
mais moins pauvres.
Pas de licenciements, de suppression
de programmes, de fermetures d'école.
Mais en échange,
le gouverneur exige
plus de contrôle de la part de État
et la modification des contrats
du syndicat des professeurs
afin de pouvoir licencier
les professeurs titulaires pour faute.
Si on refuse l'argent, on a l'air
de court-circuiter les gamins,
si on prend l'argent, on perd le contrôle
du système d'éducation,
ce qui veut dire qu'on perdra beaucoup
de familles noires de classe moyenne.
Sans compter le problème
que vous pourriez avoir dans deux ans
quand vous ferez campagne
dans les banlieues de Washington.
en leur expliquant
que vous aviez besoin de leur argent
pour sauver vos écoles de la faillite.
Il vous voit venir, Tommy.
Pour le moment,
ce n'est pas ça qui importe.
Prends l'argent.
On en a besoin.
Ne me regardez pas comme ça.
Si vous prenez cet argent,
vous trahissez les profs,
et ils sont mon principal soutien.
Si vous refusez l'argent,
c'est les gamins que vous trahissez.
Dans les deux cas, je vais sûrement vous
mettre en pièces, et le conseil aussi.
Je suis contente
de ne pas être maire.
- Tu m'as appelé ?
- J'ai reçu l'ordre de les ouvrir.
Et je sens qu'on va avoir besoin
de renforts, dans cette affaire.
Sans doute.
D'ailleurs,
il se peut que j'aie perdu Herc à cause
d'un dossier de la police interne.
Ah bon ? J'ai été indulgent
quand il a grillé le stop.
Je ne pensais même pas
qu'il y aurait un procès.
Je crois que c'est plus grave,
cette fois-ci.
Prends qui tu veux dans mon service.
Si on te mets à nouveau sur un cas
d'écoute, on t'en donnera d'autres.
Super.
Tu es complètement
à côté de la plaque,
parce qu'elle était franchement sexy.
J'y retourne vendredi après le boulot.
Attends.
Qu'est-ce que tu regardes ?
Ça te plaît, d'être à la Criminelle ?
J'adore. Pourquoi ?
Bref...
Ça arrive, patron.
C'est Joe qui laisse un message,
mais on sait déjà ce qu'il va dire.
Allez, ma fille. Faut la jouer serré.
Bon, 'Naldo, appelle tes amis
et dis-leur que c'est parti.
Exactement.
Ouais, c'est ça. Allez.
Fais-moi voir ce que tu sais faire.
Voilà. Allez,
c'est ça.
Ça va comme tu veux, Mike ?
Yo, je me sens d'attaque
pour allonger une bonne droite,
tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
Et toi, Duke ? Tu veux te battre ?
Non, je travaille la corde.
Ouais, tu t'y prends comme un pied.
Ils arrivent par derrière,
et on les attaque des deux côtés,
tu me suis ?
Hé, yo, appelle tes amis
et dis-leur où on est.
Yo, donne-moi cette corde.
Je te dis que je la veux.
T'es qu'un bouffon,
sale négro de merde.
Fait chier !
Ouais, barre-toi !
Personne ne veut plus
de toi ici !
T'as vu ça ?
Ça y est.
Hé, mon chou.
Fais du lèche-botte à ton artiste.
Souffle sur mon micro et fais un vœu.
Donne-moi 10 $.
Allez, j'ai besoin de 10 $.
Fous le camp d'ici tout de suite.
- Allez, je te suce la bite pour 15 $.
- Barre-toi, salope.
Tu veux pas voir
ce que j'ai à te montrer ?
Personne ne veut voir
la pourriture que t'as là-dessous.
- Barre-toi de là.
- Allez, donne-moi 10 $, coco.
C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
Yo, qu'est-ce que vous foutez là ?
- On fait de la peinture.
- Ouais, on peint.
Enlevez le van d'ici.
J'ai quelque chose
qui va te plaire.
Tu vois ?
On fait de la peinture.
Lequel d'entre vous
va ouvrir le camion pour moi ?
Bande d'amateurs.
Bois lentement, mon petit.
Qu'est-ce que je vais faire ?
Je vais te ramener chez toi.
Je peux pas rentrer chez moi.
Elle veut que je remplace
mon père mais...
je suis pas comme lui.
Sa façon d'être, tout ça...
Je suis pas comme lui, c'est tout.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a
entre Michael et toi ?
Mike n'est plus le même Mike.
Il a frappé un petit hier soir.
Il l'a vraiment amoché.
Je peux pas rentrer chez moi.
Je peux pas.
Attends une minute.
Je m'en veux, mon vieux.
J'aurais pas dû éloigner
Michael comme ça.
Namond a poussé un peu.
Il ne pousse plus rien, maintenant.
Je crois que je vais
aller réparer tout ça.
C'est pas un hôtel, ici.
Mon équipe
t'a laissé passer ?
On ne peux pas refuser l'entrée
à des gens d'église, dans notre région.
Tu as sûrement un service
à me demander. Alors, c'est quoi ?
Tu connais un type
qui s'appelle Bunny Colvin ?
Ouais, ce commissaire
pas très orthodoxe,
- qui voulait légaliser la drogue.
- Il te racontera mieux lui-même.
C'est une bonne nouvelle, Odell.
- C'est à propos des gamins.
- Une bonne nouvelle ?
Bunny.
M. Watkins.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Encore une idée de génie.
- Vous êtes la mère de Michael Lee ?
- Il a ses papiers sur lui ou quoi ?
Je suis pas flic.
- Je voulais juste lui parler.
- Vous êtes pas le seul.
Il est parti d'ici, il a sa propre piaule.
Il a emmené son petit frère avec lui.
- Vous savez où il habite ?
- Il m'a rien dit.
Si vous le trouvez,
dites-lui que j'ai besoin d'aide.
Je les ai pondus, lui et Bug.
Et maintenant,
ils oublient d'où ils viennent.
Elle a dit quoi, ma mère,
quand vous avez appelé ?
Elle était en colère, hein ?
Pas vraiment.
Sa mère...
Une femme charmante.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle a dit ?
"Mettez ce petit con en juvénile.
C'est là qu'il doit aller,
au moins il apprendra quelque chose".
Elle a raccroché avant que j'aie pu
lui dire qu'il n'y avait pas d'inculpation.
Ville de Baltimore, ici les Urgences.
Un flic est en train de se faire tabasser
sur Pennsie et Gold.
- Un flic ?
- Ouais, il se fait dérouiller.
- Pennsylvania et Gold ?
- Ils tirent des coups de feu maintenant.
Code 13, des coups de feu ont été tirés
sur Pennsylvania et Gold.
Code 13...
Ils l'ont descendu, cet enfoiré.
Ils l'ont embarqué dans leur van,
ces négros de mexicains.
J'ai pas entendu dire
qu'il s'était débattu.
Il a pas eu le temps.
Omar avait
tout un commando avec lui.
Il y avait même une pute qui sortait
des flingues de sa chatte.
C'était un merdier incroyable.
Je dois tirer mon chapeau à M. Little,
j'ai rien vu venir.
Ils ont pris la cargaison, Joe. Et pas
qu'un seul paquet, toute la cargaison.
Qu'est-ce qu'on va dire
à la coopérative ?
D'après toi, à quoi je pense
en ce moment ?
Tout ce que je sais, c'est que beaucoup
de gangs se sont fait piquer leur came.
Moi, je dis qu'il faut s'unir
et l'attraper, ce pédé.
C'est ça, le ghetto. C'est comme ça
qu'on résout les problèmes.
Il y a beaucoup de gangsters ici
qui vont devoir nous prendre au mot.
Ouais, la première chose qu'ils vont
devoir affronter,
c'est nous.
Il faut que tu rencontres mon pote.
Je vais t'arranger le coup.
C'est qui, cet enfoiré ?
Il faut qu'on parle, Mike.
Écoute, il faut que tu comprennes
que je ne peux pas permettre
le genre de bagarre
que tu as provoquée aujourd'hui.
Ce genre de truc doit se passer
hors de mon gymnase.
Ouais. Vas-y, Montel.
Je viens te dire que j'ai eu tort
de résoudre l'affaire comme je l'ai fait.
Casse-toi, négro.
Mike...
Me touche pas, vieux.
Écoute, ça te ressemble pas.
Il veut pas que tu le touches.
Mike.
Je te dis de reculer, connard.
Jeune homme, si c'était à vous
que je m'adressais, vous le sauriez.
Merde !
Il écoutera, la prochaine fois.
Vas-y. Bute-le.
Non.
Je vais rester ici pour attendre
l'ambulance, d'accord ?
Retourne voir tes potes.
Vas-y, petit.
ÉTAT CRITIQUE MAIS STABLE
Brûlé au 2e et 3e degré
Désolé, mon grand.
Je vais en parler
aux services sociaux.
On va t'aider.
Randy...
Vous allez m'aider, hein ?
Vous allez me protéger ?
Vous allez me protéger,
Sergent Carver ?
Franchement ?
Vous allez me protéger ?
Promis ?
Vous prendrez soin de moi, hein ?
Ça vient d'hier soir, tout ça ?
C'est Freamon qui a tout ramené. Il est
sorti tôt ce matin pour faire les poubelles.
Tu sais ce qu'il est ?
Un vandale.
Il vandalise le comité.
Il vandalise ce service.
C'est un Hun,
un Visigoth, un Barbare à nos portes,
qui veut du sang romain noble
et ce qui reste
de notre taux d'affaires classées.
Et qu'est-ce que tu fais, toi ?
J'en ai ferré un,
c'est peut-être un caïd.
Il dit en posséder un qui date d'il y a
quelques jours, sur White Coat Alley.
Mais bordel,
qu'est-ce qui vous prend, à tous ?
Est-ce que tout le monde
est parti en croisade
pour fabriquer des meurtres
à partir de rien ?
Il est passé aux aveux, Jay.
Il est allé dans un commissariat
du quartier ouest pour le faire.
Au moins, quand tu décides
de fabriquer un meurtre, Eddie,
tu as toujours un suspect sous la main.
Je respecte ça, chez toi.
Que tout le monde
en prenne de la graine.
J'ai besoin d'une déposition de témoin
dans le box numéro un.
Ouais. Laisse-moi déposer mon bordel.
J'y serai.
Du cyanure.
Tu veux dire que si on fait une analyse
de toxicologie sur ce gamin,
il testera positif au cyanure ?
Ouais. C'est bien
ce que je dis, compris ?
Il faut m'enfermer,
parce que c'est moi
qui ai tué ce gamin.
C'est moi qui l'ai tué.
Alors... enfermez-moi
et qu'on en finisse, d'accord ?
Où as-tu pris le cyanure ?
T'es malade, Bunky ?
C'était quand, la dernière fois
que tu as pris tes médicaments ?
Non, je me défonce plus.
Je vais te reposer la question :
où as-tu pris le cyanure ?
Si tu veux dire que...
- Merde !
- Désolé.
- Merde, il a eu ma manche.
- On se calme.
On va nettoyer ça,
et on va t'apporter un soda.
- Ça te fera un peu de sucre.
- Désolé.
Quand il sera calmé,
je vais lui lire ses droits.
Ouais.
Merde.
RAWLS EST UN PÉDÉ
Cette machine te dévalise
comme l'avocat de mon ex-femme.
Bon sang.
Monte là-haut.
- Allez, allez !
- Attends une seconde !
Appelle les urgences. Le bâtard de
la salle 1 vient d'essayer de se pendre.
SUR ÉCOUTE
"Pour libérer un animal coincé, appelez le
410-844-6286" - Proverbe de Baltimore
J'en ai aucune idée.
Il y en a deux sur ce pâté de maison
et trois sur Lanvale.
Une vraie concentration.
Ils ont trouvé un quartier
qui leur plaisait, ils sont revenus.
Il y en a un sur le quartier suivant,
de l'autre côté de Gilmore.
Ça fait neuf.
Ce qui fait peur, c'est qu'on n'a fait
qu'un seul district.
Merde. Un seul secteur.
Vous pensez qu'ils sont allés jusqu'où ?
Il n'y a qu'un moyen de le savoir.
Excusez-moi.
Daniels.
On en est où, avec les analyses
de la police scientifique ?
C'est le colonel qui s'en occupe,
mais d'après ce que j'ai compris,
on envoie une équipe du labo
dans chaque maison.
Jusqu'à présent, on a trouvé
des douilles de 9 mm.
Quand ils iront voir à la morgue,
ils trouveront certainement
des asticots.
Au niveau visuel, on fait un tracé
au laser autour de chaque corps
et on passe chaque lieu à l'aspirateur
pour trouver des cheveux et des fibres,
mais bien sûr,
ces maisons sont vides.
Il va falloir un an pour que le labo
examine ces sacs de saleté.
- C'est le fait d'un seul gang de dealers ?
- Certainement.
- Le gang de Marlo Stanfield.
- On en est où, avec eux ?
La Criminelle travaillait sur des écoutes
jusqu'à il y a trois mois.
- Mais on les a supprimés.
- On peut demander des renforts ?
On essaie, mais les gars de Stanfield
ont peut-être changé leur stratégie.
Dites-moi ce dont vous avez besoin,
mon Colonel.
Ce dont j'ai besoin,
c'est d'une patrouille.
Une patrouille ?
C'était l'Inspecteur Freamon,
au téléphone.
On en a trouvé deux de plus
à Lafayette, et un autre à Lanvale.
Bon Dieu.
En commençant au lieu du premier
crime, on est allés de porte en porte,
mais on ne peut pas savoir
jusqu'où le tireur est allé.
Et avec 15 000 maisons
abandonnées en ville,
il va nous falloir des semaines
pour toutes les faire.
S'il réussit à résoudre cette affaire,
il sera près du trône.
Si j'étais toi, je ne m'inquièterais pas
pour Daniels.
Il est encore bien loin de mon fauteuil,
et toi aussi.
Tu t'es manifesté trop tôt.
- C'est vrai.
- Tu n'es pas doué pour la politique.
Reste dans l'opérationnel.
Et ne me trahis plus jamais.
Annoncez ça dans tous les journaux.
Leander, va au centre-ville.
Distribue une brochure à chaque appel.
Montre-leur les clous
et les vis en détail. D'accord ?
Tu prends quelques clous avec toi,
et tu fais toutes les quincailleries.
Trouve quel est
le modèle qu'on cherche.
- Qu'est-ce que je peux faire ?
- Herc.
Je ne rigole pas. Trouve-le moi.
- Comment va-t-il ?
- Pas mal, vu les circonstances.
Il ne va pas plus mal
qu'avant de se pendre.
Et toi, tu vas où ?
Dans le quartier ouest.
Freamon en a trouvé un autre.
Il me fait chier, Freamon.
- On peut le déplacer ?
- Il est limite.
Le pouls est normal.
On lui a donné
de l'Ativan pour le manque.
Hé, tu veux aller à l'hôpital ?
J'aimerais te poser une question :
si tu avais trafiqué
de la came avec du poison,
pourquoi venir en parler ensuite
au poste de police ?
Hein ? Qui ferait un truc pareil ?
- Vous voulez qu'on attende ?
- Non.
À quoi tu penses, mon vieux ?
La came trafiquée,
c'était pour ce connard
qui me tape dessus.
Et le gamin ?
Il consommait.
Je le savais...
mais je pensais pas...
J'ai pas réfléchi.
Le gamin n'avait personne.
Pas de mère, pas de famille.
Il était dans la rue, comme moi.
Alors, j'ai essayé de...
Comme si je savais pas
ce que j'étais...
Comme si j'avais pas été un junkie
toute ma chienne de vie.
Enfermez-moi.
J'ai tué ce gamin.
La dose n'était pas destinée au gamin.
Relâchons-le.
C'est un paumé, il est déjà tellement
accablé qu'on ne fera pas mieux.
Et notre taux d'affaires classées ?
On s'en tape.
On le relâche ?
Merde, il se jettera d'un toit,
un truc comme ça.
Avec ma veine,
c'est moi qui irai le chercher.
Alors, peut-être l'hôpital de Bayview.
Un endroit avec des murs rembourrés.
T'es malade ou quoi, négro ?
Tu crois que je vais te payer deux fois
pour le même putain de paquet ?
Hé, je suis
dans le même bateau que toi.
Ce pédé a volé ma came,
comme il a volé la vôtre.
C'est un de tes gars qui a fait le coup.
C'est vous qui deviez
assurer la sécurité.
Ils ont fait la même chose
que pour les 12
dernières cargaisons.
Vous étiez très contents
jusqu'à ce que ce truc arrive.
On n'avait pas de problème
jusqu'à ce que
ce connard nous entube.
Ouais, mais tu vois, Joe,
on a fait un quorum,
on a voté et on a décidé que c'était
ta bande qui devait réparer ça.
Non, une coopérative,
ça veut dire qu'on partage.
On partage le meilleur et le pire.
D'accord.
Je ferai les fonds de tiroir
et je livrerai la cargaison, si c'est ça,
mais ne venez pas me voir
pour une réappro après ça.
Parce que quand cette bonne came
pure va débarquer du bateau,
elle sera à moi et moi seul,
puisque vous avez pas le courage
d'être de mon côté.
Vous voulez faire un autre quorum,
y réfléchir un peu ?
Ouais, c'est ce que je pensais.
Je vais les avertir qu'on a besoin
d'une nouvelle cargaison rapidement,
et vous pourrez réfléchir à ce que vous
voulez faire pour améliorer la sécurité,
et faire en sorte
que ça ne se reproduise pas.
Qu'est-ce que t'as ?
Lequel de tes gars avait
la responsabilité de la came ?
Je voudrais lui parler.
Mon neveu.
Le fils de ma sœur.
Je peux pas
me débarrasser de lui comme ça.
Je peux pas.
Mon contact avait quelqu'un sur place
quand ça a merdé.
Si c'est ce que tu veux entendre,
tu peux lui demander directement.
On est riches.
Ça, c'est une affaire réussie.
Butch.
Mon homme.
Tu te fais toute petite
maintenant, compris ?
Parce que ça va se savoir.
Ils vont te tomber dessus.
T'inquiète pas.
Yo, si quelqu'un veut m'engager
pour un autre boulot,
dis-leur que Kimmy
a pris sa retraite.
D'accord ?
Restez zen.
Combien il te reste, après avoir partagé
avec les Mexicains ?
26 net.
Joli.
Le seul problème, c'est que je vais
passer le reste de ma vie
à essayer d'écouler
la marchandise dans la rue.
Je suis pas dealer, Butch.
Tu me suis ?
Merde, on en a trop volé,
cette fois-ci.
Alors, qu'est-ce que
je vais faire, Butch ?
Ben...
tu pourrais passer
un coup de fil à Joe,
et lui offrir de racheter
sa propre came
pour 20 centimes le dollar.
Joe aurait apprécié l'humour.
Et je sais que tu apprécies aussi.
Je comprends qu'il y ait
une liste d'attente.
Mais ce gamin a déjà été placé
dans une famille d'adoption.
Exact.
Mais sa mère adoptive
est à l'hôpital, alors...
Voilà. Non.
Est-ce que je peux parler
à votre supérieur ?
Je vais être en retard pour l'appel.
Il faut que je m'occupe du gamin.
Que font les services sociaux ?
Je suis au téléphone avec eux.
Ils parlent d'un foyer collectif.
Et alors ?
Soit tu lui trouves un tuteur légal,
soit il passe par les services sociaux.
Il n'y a pas d'autre solution.
Allô ? Allô ?
On a besoin de toi.
Habille-toi.
Ils ont gelé mon salaire jusqu'à ce que
je passe devant la commission.
Je peux rien faire pour personne, Kima.
Je me fous de ce qu'ils disent.
On a besoin d'un flic.
Et je te demande si tu es flic.
Bon. Écoutez tous, bande d'attardés.
C'est une affaire compliquée.
Enfin, ce serait simple
si vous étiez allés à l'université
ou si vos mères
avaient arrêté de boire
un peu quand elles étaient enceintes.
Mais pour la police de la ville
de Baltimore, c'est compliqué.
Enfin, voici un document relatif
à l'enquête de la Criminelle
sur les corps trouvés dans les maisons
vides du quartier ouest.
Le patron veut maintenant
que tous les districts
inspectent toutes les maisons
vides de la ville.
Vous allez donc passer en revue toutes
les maison vides de votre secteur
pour voir avec quoi
elles ont été barricadées.
Sur la plupart , vous verrez les vis
que la municipalité utilise,
comme celle qu'on voit ici
sur cette brochure.
Mais si vous voyez
une maison qui a été barricadée
avec un pistolet à clous,
comme ceux qu'on voit ici,
appelez le sergent de votre secteur
immédiatement.
Vous pouvez pénétrer dans la maison,
mais si vous trouvez un corps,
ne touchez à rien. Tout est dit.
Ce que je ne comprends pas,
c'est pourquoi ils me cassent
les burnes avec cette affaire.
Daniels m'a déjà tapé sur les doigts
pour l'histoire avec le pasteur, non ?
Et Marimow s'est fait virer juste avant
de pouvoir me baiser sur autre chose.
T'es sûr qu'on est
au bon endroit ?
Ouais. Je les ai mis
sur le trottoir, par ici.
Et ensuite, tu as dégainé
ton pistolet à clous
dans l'asphalte,
à l'endroit où ils étaient assis ?
Ouais. Juste à côté de la jambe
de la petite frappe.
Qui a dit à ces connards
de la police interne
de fouiller dans mes papiers,
pour chercher un truc
dont tout le monde se contrefout ?
Ils ne m'ont quand même pas pris
en train de voler
ou de brutaliser
qui que ce soit, merde ! Hein ?
Regarde.
Ouais, ça pourrait être ça.
Ça te paraît juste ?
Ouais.
Il a dû ressortir.
J'ai porté les clous
au service balistique.
Ils m'ont dit qu'ils pourraient identifier
le modèle de pistolet,
et même le modèle de clou,
si on pouvait en trouver un.
Je sais qu'ils vont
me reprendre mes galons,
mais ils ne vont quand même pas
faire plus que ça ?
Herc, qu'est-ce que tu as fait,
exactement ?
J'ai perdu la caméra
que j'avais prise
sans l'accord de mon lieutenant.
Et les preuves que j'ai obtenues
grâce à cette caméra,
je les ai attribuées à un informateur
que j'ai inventé.
Mon petit, ils vont botter
ton petit cul de blanc-bec
comme sur celui d'une mule.
Merde.
Fais-le signer.
C'est lui qui s'est mis
dans ce pétrin, cet enfoiré.
Je le déteste, ce connard.
Il l'a traité d'enfoiré.
Vous allez le casser, ce bouton.
Je suis désolé.
Je ne voudrais pas vous déranger,
mais je ne capte que quatre chaînes.
C'est tout ce qu'on peut capter.
Et mon pote, là-bas ?
Il a une assurance.
Et l'assurance paie le câble.
Si vous êtes ici, c'est uniquement
à cause de cette fracture.
Dès qu'on peut vous relâcher,
on le fera.
Les gangsters comme vous,
vous atterrissez aux urgences
comme si vous y aviez droit.
Vous restez dans la rue
à dealer de la came
jusqu'à ce que vous vous fassiez
planter ou tirer dessus,
et vous venez vous faire
retaper gratuitement
pour pouvoir recommencer.
- Gangster, hein ?
- Vous n'en êtes pas un, peut-être ?
J'ai regardé votre dossier.
Vous êtes passé ici
en 1990 pour une blessure par balle,
et trois ans auparavant, vous êtes venu
vous faire opérer pour une entaille.
C'était il y a longtemps.
Je vois que vous persévérez.
M. Dennis Wise ?
Je m'appelle Howard Colvin.
Vous êtes de la police ?
Je l'étais, oui,
mais maintenant, je suis
une sorte de prof à Tilghman.
J'ai un petit problème.
Vous connaissez le Sergent Carver ?
Il m'a dit que vous pourriez m'aider.
Je suis allé faire un tour
dans votre salle de gym.
Ils m'ont dit ce qui s'était passé.
Qu'est-ce que je suis censé savoir ?
C'est au sujet de Namond Brice.
Oui. Quel est le problème ?
Oh... merde.
Je me suis attaché à ce gamin.
T'es au courant
pour le petit Kevin ?
J'ai vu un policier sortir de la maison
avec son collier.
Yo, c'est Kevin qui est là-haut.
Cet enfoiré tue des gens pour le plaisir.
Tu vois ?
Ce négro tue des gars
juste parce qu'il peut le faire.
Pas parce qu'ils ont balancé quelqu'un.
C'est pas une question de business.
C'est quelque chose
qui lui vient naturellement.
- Yo, Bodie...
- Le petit Kevin s'est fait buter...
C'est un macchabée, maintenant.
Tous les pauvres gars
qui sont dans ces maisons...
- Il se fout de tout.
- Bodie, calme-toi, merde.
Je l'emmerde, Marlo !
Qu'il aille se faire foutre,
lui et tous ceux qui pensent qu'on peut
buter les gens comme ça.
Tu m'entends ?
Allez tous vous faire foutre,
bande de cons.
Lâche-moi, merde.
Le gamin dans le sac, c'est son copain.
Il est complètement déjanté, ce mec.
Tu vois ce bordel, yo ?
Allez, enfermez-le, ce crétin.
...Le nombre de victimes
qu'on a découvertes mortes par balle
dans des maisons abandonnées...
C'est flatteur pour nous.
Ça éclipse complètement le déficit
de l'école des titres des journaux.
Ça, c'est de la chance.
- Ces corps sont sur les bras de Royce.
- Le déficit de l'école devrait l'être aussi.
Oui, mais ce problème se posera
lors de la prochaine année fiscale.
D'ici là, tu seras sorti d'affaire.
Alors, je prends l'argent du gouverneur
et dans deux ans, quand je serrerai
les mains de tous les électeurs
des banlieues de Washington,
ils diront : "Ah oui,
c'est vous le type
qui avait besoin de mes impôts
pour sauver vos écoles de la faillite".
Si tu prends son chèque, tu perds
des votes à Prince George et Montgomery,
et tu ne pourras pas le battre au niveau
de l'État sans l'aide des comtés.
Mais dans deux ans,
si tu es gouverneur,
tu pourras aider
la ville en étant à Annapolis.
Il est maire, pour l'instant.
Je sais qu'on ne peut pas changer
les écoles de cette ville,
mais on ne peut pas
les laisser empirer non plus.
Retourne à Annapolis.
Mets-toi à plat ventre.
Si on perd le contrôle
des écoles au niveau local,
Nerese et les profs
vont te mettre en pièces,
mais le reste de la ville verra
que tu l'as fait pour les enfants.
Les enfants ne votent pas.
Tu prends des risques
avec notre cargaison, hein ?
En organisant un rendez-vous
avec quelqu'un d'autre que nous.
J'étais obligé.
Ce garçon a besoin d'être rassuré.
Patron, garde ce petit Marlo
en ligne de mire,
il pourrait essayer de nous doubler,
nous et la coopérative.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
Ils sont prudents, ces Grecs.
Tu crois qu'ils vont lui faire confiance ?
Ils le connaissent pas.
Nous, ils nous connaissent.
Merde.
Regarde-le qui revient, cet enfoiré.
Doucement, petit.
Du calme.
J'aurais dû penser
que je vous trouverais ici,
à dépenser de l'énergie
après les heures de boulot.
Je vais te tuer
et plutôt deux fois qu'une.
Ah, tu veux pas
récupérer ta cargaison, alors ?
Crache le morceau.
Il se trouve
que j'ai de l'héroïne à vendre.
Au point de vue affaires, vous avez l'air
de chercher à acheter. Non ?
T'as pas honte.
Y'a pas de honte, dans mon business,
mon gars.
Je suis ici pour faire affaire.
C'est pas vrai, Joe ?
- Combien ?
- 20 cents pour un dollar.
10 cents, cousin.
Me fais pas dire 25.
Ça fait 400 000.
Et si on emmenait ton cul de pédé
dans l'arrière chambre,
pour te faire subir
un peu de brutalité diabolique,
et trouver notre came
à la manière ancienne ?
- Tu me suis ?
- Oh, oui.
Ça me paraît valable, comme plan.
Mais je sais pas, Joe. Tu crois
qu'Omar va se laisser prendre ?
D'accord, 20 cents pour un dollar.
Comment va l'horloge, Joe ?
Je te tiens au courant.
Et il pense que j'aiderai les écoles,
et encore plus la ville,
si je suis gouverneur dans deux ans.
Je me dis que comme ça,
ça ne se retournera pas contre moi
si je ne prends pas l'argent.
Tu me demandes mon avis ?
Je pense que tu feras le bon choix.
Je te jure, c'est la vérité.
Tu me chatouilles.
Tu es sûre que tu veux le faire ?
Je ne veux pas te faire du mal.
Inspecteur Crutchfield,
vous avez un moment ?
Oui, madame.
Quelque chose ne va pas ?
J'ai une question sur ces rapports.
Est-ce qu'on les a tous
trouvés dans la cave ?
Non, madame. On a trouvé
la plupart dans la cave,
mais certains à l'étage aussi.
Est-ce que vous pourriez être plus
spécifique dans les 24 heures,
pour ma propre gouverne,
tout au moins ?
- Sans problème.
- Merci.
Combien on en a, jusqu'à présent ?
- 17.
- Bon Dieu.
Ça fait beaucoup de rouge.
C'est ta première "Red Bull".
Oui. J'ai décidé de prendre
une ou deux affaires locales,
tranquilles, pour commencer.
On a déjà la presse nationale
sur le sujet.
Tout va bien se passer, Rhonnie.
Mais ne laisse pas
ces types te voir stresser.
J'ai besoin de classer une affaire.
Pour convaincre Mello de signer,
j'ai besoin d'un accord de principe.
Il défonce la fenêtre d'une voiture,
et tu veux le relâcher ?
Quelle est l'estimation de la date,
vu la décomposition des corps ?
Celui qui est sur Mount Street en est
à peu près à une semaine.
Certains sont morts
depuis quelques jours,
d'autres sont déjà
au stade de squelettes.
Ils sont tous morts
d'une balle dans la tête ?
Plusieurs balles, pour la plupart.
Des jeunes hommes noirs,
de 15 à 25 ans ?
Certains étaient plus âgés.
On en a un qui porte un uniforme
de vigile, quelque part.
Vous avez pris
les empreintes au laser ?
Aspiré les pièces ?
Oui.
Cherché des traces de sang ?
Quelle est la répartition géographique ?
13 dans le quartier ouest, de Baltimore
à Winchester, de Schroeder au Grove.
Les gars du quartier est en ont trouvé
quatre autres sur Monument Street.
- Le quartier est ?
- Oui, ça nous a embrouillés.
On ratisse donc plus large, on cherche
les maisons vides de toute la ville.
J'ai parié sur le numéro 23.
J'ai encore de l'espoir.
C'est un gros morceau, cette affaire.
Tu sais, si j'étais flic, je ne crois pas que
je pourrais traiter ça à la légère. Et toi ?
Pas si j'étais un vrai flic.
Voilà.
Merci, Inspecteur.
Calvin, tu as fini ?
Ouais, j'ai fini.
Votre attention, je vous rappelle
que les feuilles de réponse doivent être
rendues au bureau en personne
immédiatement
après la fin des tests.
Merci de votre coopération.
On en est où, avec le pistolet à clous ?
C'est un modèle Hilti DX.
Sophistiqué, mais courant
parmi les contractants.
Celui que le Sergent Hauk a vu
à l'arrière du camion de Chris Partlow ?
On lui en a montré un,
et il croit que oui.
Ensuite, on a ramené ses fesses
à l'endroit où la voiture s'est arrêtée.
- Ça a donné quoi ?
- On a peut-être trouvé un trou
où il dit avoir tiré,
mais pas de clou, même après avoir
passé tout le pâté de maison
au détecteur de métaux.
Il s'est probablement coincé
dans une voiture de patrouille
et maintenant, il est dans
un tas de pneus quelque part.
Donc, notre prochaine étape, c'est
la recherche et la saisie de ce camion.
Ainsi qu'un mandat du tribunal
pour obtenir des cheveux et du sang
de Chris et de Snoop.
Avec tout ce qu'on sort
de ces maisons,
on a peut-être une chance
de trouver une trace.
- Quelle est votre preuve ?
- Herc a vu le pistolet à clous.
On a bien le droit de posséder un outil.
Quelles sont les preuves sur Chris
et Snoop, plus exactement ?
Un témoin...
Le garçon à qui un de ses complices
a dit qui était le meurtrier.
Ce gamin est une source,
pas un témoin.
S'il n'est qu'une source,
ça ne suffit pas.
Non, mais avec les liens qu'on a pu
établir entre les corps
et l'organisation de Stanfield,
on a un modèle qui se dessine.
C'est faible, très faible.
Oh, et puis merde.
Donnez-moi une heure.
Tu ne m'as pas lâché
de toute la semaine.
Chaque fois que je sors de la piscine,
tu veux me sécher sans serviette.
- Dennis Wise.
- Salut.
Alors, vous vous êtes renseigné ?
Sur mon ordre, il veut bien s'asseoir avec
vous et entendre ce que vous avez à dire.
Mais pour ce que vous lui demandez...
J'en sais rien.
Enfin, bonne chance quand même.
Si vous revoyez mon pote Carver,
dites-lui que c'est
à charge de revanche.
- D'accord. Merci.
- Pas de problème, mon frère.
Vous revenez avec un mandat ?
Le dur de la chambre 232.
D'après ce que je sais, il s'occupe
d'un programme de sport pour les gamins.
Il s'est fait tirer dessus pour avoir
enlevé un gamin de la rue.
Écoutez, il faut que vous parliez,
sinon vous aurez sur la conscience
le fait de ne pas avoir parlé.
Ils n'ont pas voulu
me laisser voir mon fils à la morgue.
Ils m'ont dit qu'il n'en restait pas grand
chose quand vous l'avez trouvé.
On a fait ce qu'on a pu avec
les informations dont on disposait.
J'ai entendu dire qu'un certain Chris
et une fille du nom de Loop ou Snoop
ont pris mon fils et l'ont tué.
Ils m'ont dit que je ne reverrais plus
mon garçon.
Pourquoi ne pouvez-vous pas faire
une exception pour lui
et mettre son nom en haut de la liste,
afin qu'il retrouve une famille adoptive ?
La liste, c'est la liste.
Certains clients sont dans des foyers
depuis des années.
Il a vécu en foyer pendant des années.
- Et maintenant, il doit y retourner ?
- N'élevez pas la voix, s'il vous plaît.
- Si vous me parlez sur ce ton...
- Je vous en prie.
Il doit bien y avoir un moyen
pour qu'il n'ait pas à y retourner...
Oui, il y a un moyen.
Il doit bien y en avoir un.
Et si...
Et si je le prenais chez moi
en tant que parent adoptif ?
Le processus de sélection
prend trois ou quatre mois.
Cet enfant ne peut pas être
sous votre garde, Sergent.
Il doit être sous notre surveillance,
c'est la loi sur la délinquance juvénile.
Vous vous prenez pour un caïd
parce que vous harcelez les gens ?
Mais je suis un caïd.
Je me taperais bien une nana.
Ouais, moi aussi.
Ils ont jeté leurs outils.
Rien sous les sièges.
Rien dans la boîte à gants.
Elle appartient certainement
à une petite vieille.
Ces types savent comment ça marche.
Vous les imaginez dans cette voiture ?
Allez.
Ah, merde.
Voilà.
C'est même pas notre camion.
Mais j'ai besoin de te l'entendre dire.
Moi ?
C'est pas mon affaire.
C'est ce que dit Joe. Je suis ici
pour Joe, c'est tout.
Je lui fais confiance et je le respecte,
je travaille pour lui depuis des années.
Toi, je te connais pas.
Et j'ai pas besoin de te connaître.
Mais si ce truc tourne mal
pour Joe, alors...
Comment je peux être sûr
que c'est pas un coup monté ?
Comment je peux être sûr que t'es pas
dans le coup, toi aussi ?
Tu peux être sûr,
parce que Joe te le dit,
et parce que je te le dis aussi.
Et tu fais confiance à tes gars, toi ?
J'ai discuté avec mon chauffeur.
J'ai vu dans son âme.
Chris et Snoop viennent
de se faire embarquer
pour possession d'arme.
Ils l'ont trouvée dans le camion.
Appelle le prêteur de caution.
Mais d'abord, fais-le suivre, lui.
Qui, le blanc avec le chapeau ?
- Pourquoi, il te pose un problème ?
- Non.
J'ai juste besoin
d'en savoir plus sur lui.
- D'accord.
- Bon.
T'es content ?
90 000 $ pour toi
demain matin.
On prendra Omar
en chasse plus tard,
une fois que l'affaire des maisons vides
se sera tassée.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous là ?
Tu crois que tu as
obtenu un non-lieu
par l'opération du Saint Esprit ?
T'as faim ?
Allez.
PRÊTEUR DE CAUTION SHUMAN
Alors.
Ce Chris Partlow doit faire l'objet
d'une sécurité particulière,
vu ses antécédents.
La fille, Pearson, par contre,
pas tellement. D'accord ?
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Ordre du tribunal.
On prend du sang et des cheveux.
14 cheveux,
12 poils,
deux échantillons de sang chacun.
Ça fait beaucoup de maisons,
beaucoup de choses.
Qui sait ce que vous y avez oublié ?
On est encore en ville ?
On est à l'arboretum de Cylburn.
Pimlico est juste
au sommet de la colline.
C'est joli.
Je suis pas une balance.
J'ai pas dit le contraire.
Ça fait longtemps que je fais ça.
J'ai jamais rien dit à un flic.
Je me sens vieux.
Je suis dans la rue
depuis l'âge de 13 ans.
J'ai jamais grugé personne,
jamais volé un paquet,
j'ai jamais fait
ce que j'étais pas censé faire.
J'ai toujours été réglo.
Et comment on me remercie ?
Tu crois que si je me retrouve
dans une embrouille,
ils diront :
"Bon. Bodie a toujours été loyal.
Bodie va tenir bon,
il faut payer son avocat.
Faut le libérer sur caution".
Ils veulent que je les défende, non ?
Mais eux, ils sont où, alors qu'ils sont
censés être ici avec nous ?
C'est vrai, quand les choses foirent
et qu'il faut payer, y'a plus personne.
Le jeu est truqué, mon pote.
On est comme des pédés
sur un jeu d'échecs.
Des pions.
Yo, je balancerai
aucun de mes potes...
Ni les gens de mon coin de rue,
ni les gens de Barksdale,
ou ce qu'il en reste.
Mais Marlo...
Les négros de ce genre, je te jure,
il faut les faire tomber.
Pour que ça arrive,
quelqu'un doit se mouiller.
Je ferai ce que j'ai à faire.
Je m'en tape.
Mais me demande pas
de me traîner à genoux, tu vois ?
T'es un soldat, Bodie.
Tu m'étonnes.
Je me souviens de vous.
Dans le temps, vous étiez flic
sur Pennsie et Fremont.
Oui, c'est mon ancien poste.
- C'est moi qui ai délimité le CBS.
- Le quartier Calhoun, Baker, Stricker.
Ouais, à l'époque, il fallait toujours
vous taper dessus.
Je m'en souviens.
Ouais. Je suis plus flic.
Comme j'ai dit à Cutty,
je suis professeur maintenant,
en quelque sorte,
et c'est comme ça
que je connais Namond.
Si je suis ici, c'est que Cutty
s'est porté garant pour vous.
Il a dit ce que je demandais ?
Votre fils...
il est malin, drôle,
il a bon cœur,
et il a de la ressource.
J'avais pas remarqué au début,
parce qu'il en faisait toujours trop,
toujours à parler le langage de la rue...
Il racontait
des conneries pour se cacher.
Mais il pourrait aller loin,
faire des choses dans la vie,
voir du pays, d'une manière
qui était impossible pour vous et moi.
Enfin, les gens comme nous.
Et merde.
On ira au cimetière en sachant toujours
sur quel pâté de maison finit
la voie sans issue de Bentalou,
qui a obtenu
sa licence IV à l'Underground
ou sur quel coin de rue
Tater s'est fait tirer dessus
quand il est sorti
du Musical Lounge en 1988.
C'est une vision en or.
Le quartier ouest
qu'on connaissait...
il est mort, vieux.
Vous savez, les gens du business,
de nos jours,
c'est plus la même chose...
Pas de code, pas de famille,
et pas de respect, ça c'est sûr.
Si vous mettez Namond
dans la rue maintenant,
je lui donne peut-être un ou deux ans
avant de le retrouver à la morgue.
Et si vous avez de la chance,
il sera peut-être ici avec vous.
Peut-être, peut-être que non.
C'est ça, le business.
Je parle de Namond, M. Brice.
Il a beaucoup de choses pour lui.
Il pourrait nous surprendre tous
si on lui donnait sa chance,
mais il est pas fait
pour dealer dans la rue.
Il est pas comme on était
à son âge.
C'est pour ça que je suis venu ici,
parce que je veux croire
que vous le savez,
vu qui vous êtes et
ce que vous avez vécu.
Vous connaissez votre fils.
Tout ça dépend de vous,
mon vieux.
Vous m'en demandez trop.
Oui, mais au moins je demande.
Tu es sûr que c'était le petit Bodie ?
Je l'ai vu sortir du Centre de Rétention
sur le côté de Eager Street.
Et puis, il est monté dans une voiture
avec un type blanc.
Un flic ? Quel genre de voiture ?
Une Caprice ?
Non, une vieille bagnole pourrie.
Ils t'ont en ligne de mire.
Ils t'emmerdent, et ils fouillent
dans ces maisons vides, hein ?
C'est pas le moment
de se faire balancer.
On n'est pas encore sûrs.
Quoi, tu veux laisser tomber ?
Et prendre le risque ?
Fais passer le message.
Tu peux confier ça à ton poulain,
pour le mettre dans le bain.
Toi et Snoop,
vous la mettez en veilleuse
jusqu'à ce que
toute cette merde se calme.
Le gamin bossait pour Bodie.
Pour la première fois, il vaut mieux que
ce soit quelqu'un d'inconnu.
T'as entendu ce que Joe a dit ?
Il dit que cet enfoiré
qui a volé notre came
veut nous la revendre
à 30 cents le dollar.
Joe dit que ça va coûter 90 de plus
pour racheter notre part.
Hé, yo.
J'ai cru que vous m'aviez oublié.
Si tu attendais dehors, hein ?
Vous avez parlé à son père ?
Si ça va comme je l'ai prévu,
il sera de retour
chez sa mère d'ici demain.
C'est un grand jour demain.
Watkins nous a obtenu
30 minutes dans le bureau du maire.
Yo, Spider, on en est à combien ?
Je ne crois même pas qu'on va tout
vendre, aujourd'hui.
Yo, Bodie.
Yo, Bodie.
Yo, Bodie, tu ferais mieux
de partir en courant.
C'est mon coin.
Je partirai nulle pas.
Bodie, t'es dingue ?
C'est la merde !
Allez, connards !
Je m'en tape !
Je suis là !
Tu me mettras pas dans
une de ces maisons vides.
Bodie, allez, mon gars.
Je ne le sens pas.
Écoute, j'ai des doutes.
Je voudrais...
Madame.
Si...
Désolé.
Si le maire préfère ne pas...
Enfin, s'il se sent plus à l'aise
seul avec le Dr Parenti,
à cause de la controverse sur
la légalisation des drogues l'an dernier...
Je ne crois pas que M. le Maire
fasse partie de votre réunion.
Il est à Annapolis.
D'accord, merci.
- Alors ?
- Quoi de neuf ?
Tu dors encore ?
L'avenir appartient
à ceux qui se lèvent tôt.
Ça te plaît, ta piaule ?
Ça va, merci.
Ça doit faire du bien de vivre seul.
Yo, d'où tu sors cette bague ?
Je l'ai prise à un négro.
Pourquoi ? Tu la veux ?
Non. Garde-la, petit.
Je vais préparer Bug
pour aller à l'école.
T'es prêt à travailler ?
Deux choses :
d'abord, on va te donner
le coin de Payson Street.
C'était le coin de Bodie.
Maintenant, il est à toi.
Alors, prépare ton équipe
et occupe-toi de ça.
Les bénéfices
de ce business sont à toi.
Ensuite, il y a un autre truc.
Yo, je voudrais pas
être trop curieuse,
mais c'est qui
qu'a été buté pour toi ?
- Le père de Bug.
- Sérieux ?
C'est pas comme ça
qu'on écrit "attirail".
- Merde, comment ça s'écrit, alors ?
- Salut, les gars.
Pas comme ça.
McNulty, salut.
T'es là de 4h00 à 12h00, non ?
- T'es au courant pour Bodie ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- Bodie, le gars de Payson Street.
- Ouais. Quoi ?
On l'a descendu sur son coin de rue.
La brigade de nuit l'a trouvé.
Lis les infos.
Sergent, ramenez vos fesses.
Bon sang, Sergent, vous êtes
au bord de l'insubordination.
Appelle les services sociaux tout de
suite et envoie-le là-bas. C'est un ordre.
Lieutenant...
J'ai 235 $, si ça peut aider.
Pourquoi ça aiderait ?
On pourrait peut-être trouver un foyer
comme ça... en payant quelqu'un.
C'est de la ségrégation,
pure et simple.
Non, c'est un processus
de socialisation.
Pour les parents,
c'est quand même de la ségrégation.
Mais c'est pour leur bien,
et pour le bien des profs
qui essaient d'enseigner.
Et vous proposez d'appliquer ça
à tous les collèges ?
Avec votre soutien
et assez de subventions, oui.
D'ici septembre.
Mais vous ne feriez pas
de préparation aux tests ?
Ces enfants seraient mis en retard,
si on peut dire.
Oui, mais vu la situation,
ils sont tous en retard.
On ne veut pas l'admettre, c'est tout.
- Ce qu'on veut dire, c'est...
- Messieurs...
Nous vous tiendrons au courant.
Alors quoi, c'est tout ?
Après nous avoir écoutés pendant
deux minutes, ils nous poignardent ?
J'ai tout fait rater.
On dirait qu'à chaque fois
que j'ouvre la bouche dans cette ville,
je dis quelque chose que les gens
ne veulent pas entendre.
- C'est pas ta faute. C'est le processus.
- Le processus ?
Quand on aura la subvention,
on réfléchira, on proposera des solutions.
S'ils écoutent, très bien.
Sinon, c'est quand même
une recherche très utile.
Ce qu'on publiera
sur le sujet attira l'attention.
De qui ?
D'autres chercheurs et universitaires.
Des universitaires ?
Quoi, ils vont étudier ton étude ?
Quand est-ce que ça va changer ?
Et tu l'as viré, hein ?
Il fallait le punir.
Bon, s'il est parti, il est parti.
Oh, non. Ne fais pas ça.
Tu ne me prendras pas mon fils,
- par pour ça...
- Souviens-toi à qui tu parles.
Souviens-toi qui je suis.
Ma parole vaut encore quelque chose.
Ici, à Baltimore,
et dans tout endroit que tu considères
comme étant chez toi,
ma parole est entendue.
Ils te trouveront.
Un type est venu me voir pour me dire
que mon fils pouvait tout faire.
Sauf se battre.
Ouais, regarde-moi.
Qui voudrait devenir comme moi
s'il pouvait faire autre chose,
De'Londa ?
Alors...
tu me vires, moi aussi ?
Je suis toujours là pour toi.
On s'en sortira.
Mais tu vas laisser le petit tranquille.
Je compte là-dessus.
C'est Omar, mon frère.
C'est pour ta banque ?
Ça, c'est pour le dérangement, Butch.
Je serai ma propre banque, maintenant.
Ils t'ont pas suivi ?
Non. Joe a payé à ma façon.
Il a fallu qu'il admette que ma parole
valait plus que la sienne. Compris ?
Allons-y, alors.
Il est dans la camionnette,
dans le garage,
à l'arrière de la maison
qui est au 2249 Polk Street.
La clé sera dans le moellon.
Après avoir volé autant,
t'as pas encore ?
C'est pas encore fini.
Le problème avec ce Républicain
de mes deux,
c'est qu'il n'a pas l'étoffe
de ses pères spirituels.
Bon Dieu.
T'as laissé l'argent sur la table.
Cet arrogant fils de pute.
Il allait me faire supplier,
et puis organiser
une conférence de presse
pour que le monde entier
me voie à genoux.
Ne t'inquiète pas.
Dans deux ans,
on va le faire payer.
Le coin est fermé.
Allez, par là.
Sauf toi, enfoiré.
Contre le mur.
Désolé pour Bodie.
Je suis pas là pour t'embarquer.
J'essaie de faire justice.
- Qui l'a buté ?
- Vous l'avez tous buté.
Ils l'ont descendu
parce qu'il vous parlait.
Il a été vu avec des flics
au centre de rétention.
Alors, mets-moi les menottes
ou vire-moi de ce coin de rue
avant qu'il ne m'arrive la même chose.
Hé, Duquan.
Tu n'es pas censé être à Douglass ?
J'y vais, ouais.
Où est ton cartable ?
Je vais passer à la maison
pour le prendre.
C'est un cadeau pour tout
ce que vous avez fait pour moi.
C'est pour votre bureau.
C'est super, Duquan.
Merci.
Passe me voir quand tu veux,
donne-moi de tes nouvelles.
D'accord.
- Mais je ne veux pas y retourner.
- Le programme est supprimé, Zenobia.
Ouais.
De retour avec la populace.
Oui.
Je fais mes bagages.
Et toi ?
Enfin, c'était pas mal...
Mais il est peut-être temps.
Pourquoi tu es réveillé ?
Tu travailles de 4h00 à 12h00.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
C'est à propos de ces corps.
Lester et ses gars
reprennent l'affaire.
C'est Daniels qui commande.
Il fait du lèche-bottes maintenant.
Il a de l'influence.
Tu veux l'affaire.
J'ai l'impression que c'est mon devoir.
Envers qui ?
Ce gamin.
Le gamin du coin de rue.
Je m'apprêtais
à le sortir de la rue, tu sais.
Je l'aurais confié à Lester.
C'est un des corps
qu'on a trouvé dans les maisons ?
Non, ils l'ont laissé dans la rue.
Je ferais peut-être les choses
différemment, tu vois ?
Différemment ?
Oui, plus de...
prostitution, plus d'alcool,
plus rien de tout ça.
Plus de colère.
Je suis mieux maintenant,
ici, avec toi.
Je ne joue plus le "Jimmy gros dur"
avec les gens.
"Jimmy gros dur" ?
Je te jure, Beadie,
ce fils de pute m'a presque tué.
T'en fais pas.
- Quoi ?
- Vous avez essayé.
Vous ne devriez pas
vous en vouloir.
Merci.
Très bien, Randy, par ici.
Prends le lit du haut.
22 voilà les keufs.
T'es sûr ?
Je ne te dis pas ça
parce que je n'ai pas besoin de toi.
Je te le demande pour ta sécurité.
Je crois que je peux le faire
en me tenant éloigné de moi-même,
si tu comprends ce que je veux dire.
Mais je vais te dire.
On n'arrivera pas
à chopper Marlo Stanfield
ou quiconque dans la rue,
pas pour un vol tout simple.
Qu'est-ce que tu suggères ?
Soit une large contre-enquête
ou une écoute électronique.
C'est comme ça
qu'on résoudra l'affaire.
T'es sûr ?
Tu devrais peut-être le faire,
vite fait bien fait.
Tu n'en ferais pas partie, alors.
C'est la hiérarchie, mon Colonel.
Comment pourrait-on
augmenter les pourcentages
en classe de maths et de lecture ?
Vous croyez aux chiffres ?
38% dans la moyenne,
8% d'un niveau supérieur.
Quoi ?
"Dans la moyenne" veut dire qu'ils sont
en retard d'au moins deux classes.
"Niveau supérieur" veut dire qu'ils sont
soit à niveau soit un an en retard.
Ils mettent les notes
de cette façon, et...
ils disent qu'on progresse.
Bon. Je suis encore en phase
d'apprentissage.
Non, tout ira bien.
Albert, Zenobia, Namond,
ravi de vous revoir parmi nous.
Ouais. Votre pire cauchemar
qui revient vous hanter.
Non, je rigole.
Bon. Ouvrez tous vos livres
à la page 121.
Qui a résolu le premier problème ?
- Kareem ?
- 164.
Exact.
Comment as-tu trouvé ?
- J'en sais rien.
- Allez. Montre-nous.
Moi qui croyais avoir terminé.
- Ça nous en fait combien ? 20 ?
- 22.
Quelqu'un a des nouvelles de Bunk ?
Le service balistique dit
que les armes ne correspondent à rien.
Ils ont effacé les empreintes.
On trouvera peut-être un témoin.
Le labo nous trouvera peut-être
un cheveu ou une éclaboussure.
Mais à part ça,
il va falloir se bouger.
Où ça en est
avec le nouveau corps ?
Retour à la case départ.
C'est parti pour durer longtemps.
Mon Colonel, comment avez-vous
choisi cet endroit ?
Lemel ?
Ils l'ont fermé il y a quelques années,
et je savais que c'était proche
de nombreux lieux de crime.
Je suis allé à l'école ici,
il y a longtemps.
J'ai eu une bonne éducation,
maintenant que j'y pense.
Vous avez essayé de lui parler ?
Je ne savais pas quoi dire.
Je n'ai appris la nouvelle que ce matin.
Faut croire
que j'ai pas lu le rapport.
Il a vraiment essayé de se tuer ?
Ce n'était pas que du spectacle ?
Bub a des problèmes, mais le manque
de sincérité n'en fait pas partie.
C'est dingue,
ce que la honte peut vous faire faire.
Ça vous donne envie de changer,
et puis ça vous déprime quand
on se rend compte qu'on ne peut pas.
C'était quand, la dernière fois
que vous lui avez parlé ?
Il y a plus de deux ans.
Quand il avait arrêté la came.
S'il est dans ce service,
il doit être plus sobre que jamais.
Vous venez ?
Peut-être plus tard.
CRISE DU BUDGET SCOLAIRE
J'y crois pas, qu'il ait pu refuser cet argent.
- Pourquoi ?
- Pour l'école, les gamins.
Merde.
T'as pas encore passé
assez de temps ici.
Ils déçoivent toujours.
Plus on s'approche et plus on le voit.
Tous.
Tu soutiens qui, l'an prochain ?
S'il veut le poste d'Elijah, je resterai
peut-être avec Royce.
Sinon, ce jeune loup de Salisbury
pense qu'il peut rafler
le siège du 1er District.
Tu peux le regarder dans les yeux,
maintenant.
Peu importe qui il est et ce qu'il a fait,
regarde-le bien dans les yeux.
Je suis toujours ton père.
INCONNU
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
SALOPE DE BALANCE !
Près du corps.
C'est ça, continue.
Qu'est-ce que tu regardes ?
Qu'est-ce que tu regardes ?
Vous ne pouvez pas rester ici.
Il faut que vous trouviez quelque chose
de constructif à faire. Allez.
Michael.
Michael.
Le flingue.
Tu vas être en retard.
Allez. Vas-y.
Où est ton assiette ?
Yo, Tyrell, attends un peu.
Tu vois...
Je suis lŕ pour te dire
que ce mutisme de merde
te servira ŕ rien,
contrairement ŕ ce qui se raconte.
T'es assis lŕ ŕ t'y tenir,
attendant ton avocat tous frais payés,
pensant que t'as rien ŕ craindre, hein ?
Eh bien, tu vois,
ce truc marche
que pour les grands criminels...
Quand t'as pas été chopé en flag.
Quand ton pote
est pas dans la pičce d'ŕ côté
en train de t'accuser.
Il te dénonce comme une petite pute.
On a męme été au McDo pour lui,
vu tout ce qu'il nous a dit.
Deux Royal Cheese, une grande frite,
des cookies,
un Dr Pepper.
C'est ce qu'il prend, hein ?
Allez, dehors.
- On va oů ?
- Faire une pause.
Pour que tu bouffes ça.
D'accord, mais je dirai quand męme
que dalle.
Monell, qu'est-ce tu fous ?
Combien de temps, qu'on fait ça,
tu crois ?
Au moins 20 ans.
Vrai.
Vrai.
Faux.
Charge-les.
- Ça marche vraiment ?
- Oh oui. Les Américains
sont cons, et pas qu'un peu.
On gobe quasiment tout.
Ça sent mon coeur battre ?
Ton pouls ? Oui.
Si Monell dit que j'avais le flingue,
c'est faux.
La machine décčle les histoires, fiston.
Pręts, professeur ?
On va commencer par une facile.
Tu t'appelles bien
DeShawn Fredericks ?
Vrai.
Et tu habites bien
au 1200 Woodyear Street
ŕ Baltimore Ouest ?
- Vrai.
- Et toi et Monell,
vous avez buté votre pote Pookie
sur Cary Street, comme Monell l'a dit ?
Mensonge. Enculé de menteur.
La machine ne se trompe jamais, fiston.
Fait chier !
Ce renoi peut jamais fermer sa gueule.
J'aurais dű foutre une bastos
ŕ Pookie moi-męme.
Laisser Monell ŕ la maison.
C'est rien qu'une petite pute.
Plus le mensonge est gros,
plus ils y croient.
{\c&HFFFFFF&}<b>MORE WITH LESS</b>
{\c&HFFFFFF&}"Plus le mensonge est gros,
plus ils y croient." - Bunk
D'abord le BlackBerry.
Il a męme pris sa musique.
Toute cette filature finit par payer.
Y en a un qui arrive.
Homme noir non identifié.
- <i>Tu le vois, Jimmy ?</i>
- Oui. Un autre face-ŕ-face.
Merde.
Ce serait bien plus marrant
si on était réellement payés.
Tu sais, j'ai entendu une histoire
ŕ ton sujet,
- quand j'étais du côté Ouest.
- C'est faux.
- J'ai encore rien dit.
- Quoi que ce soit, c'est faux.
T'étais sous couverture
pour de la prostitution,
et au lieu de te retirer,
t'as continué et conclu l'affaire.
J'ai lu ce rapport
oů tu t'es fait sucer par une pute,
et t'as écrit que tu t'étais fait sucer.
Tu crois tout ce que tu lis ?
Écoute,
tout ce que je dis,
c'est que si je prends ta came,
faut un partage réglo.
Je dois payer tous mes gars pareil,
et tu m'augmentes le tarot.
- Paye moins tes gars.
- C'est mes gars.
Alors, réduis ta part.
60/40.
Tu veux mieux, équipe-toi.
Chris, Snoop et le reste de mes gars
rendront une petite visite aux tiens.
On sera bref avec vous,
bande d'enculés.
Tu dois capter.
Ça marche.
En direction du nord, sur Fulton.
Lester, c'est pour toi.
Je le vois.
<i>Bien reçu.</i>
Tous les jours la męme merde.
- Regardez cette belle salope.
- Garde-ŕ-vous !
Posez vos culs.
Je vais pas rester lŕ
ŕ prétendre ętre insulté
car vous prétendez
respecter mon grade.
Aujourd'hui, il est sergent-chef.
Demain, il pourrait ętre
un tout nouveau lieutenant.
On sait jamais avec ces enculés
qui pensent qu'ŕ leur carričre.
Si je pensais ŕ ma carričre, je serais
ŕ l'Ouest, dirigeant des incapables ?
Passons ŕ la lecture et aux mandats.
Nique la lecture.
C'est quoi, ce bordel avec nos heures ?
Du calme.
Si je le savais, je le dirais.
On est dans le męme bateau.
2 semaines et quelques que j'ai pas
vu la couleur de mes heures sup'.
Je dois payer la banque,
l'archidiocčse
pour les études de mes enfants
et mon ex-femme
pour qu'elle se paie un avocat.
Fermez vos gueules et posez vos culs !
Ŕ vos putains de places !
Les heures sup' restent autorisées
et les fiches d'attestation
sont toujours signées.
Mais vous nous payez pas.
Le syndic' nous dit d'aller ŕ la NLRB
- pour gérer ça.
- Il est dit
que dčs que la situation budgétaire
se sera améliorée,
nous aurons ça
via des paiements ou des récup'.
- Pour chaque heure.
- Des paiements, mon cul.
Ça, c'est que de la paperasse.
65 heures de paperasse inutile !
Agent Brown, pose tes fesses.
Assis !
Nous sommes tous des professionnels.
Nous gérons le district le plus chaud
d'une des villes
les plus dangereuses au monde.
Soyez fiers.
Des promesses ont été faites,
elles seront respectées.
La situation actuelle de la ville
est mauvaise,
mais ne le restera pas.
Attendons cela
en tant que professionnels.
Bon.
Retour aux sujets.
Le premier est
de la Centrale des véhicules.
Aucune unité
ne pourra se rendre sur Dickman Street
jusqu'ŕ nouvel ordre.
Les réductions et prévisions
exigent que chaque district
fasse avec les véhicules
dans leur état actuel.
Ce qui veut dire...
Ces caisses merdiques
tombent en morceaux.
Ils sont au courant, putain ?
<i>Vous ętes oů ?</i>
<i>Derričre lui.</i>
Il est ŕ vous.
<i>Ça marche, Lester.</i>
<i>Ça marche.</i>
- Ils se fatiguent jamais.
- Je sais pas,
les roues vont bientôt
tomber des voitures.
On promettait y a un an augmentations
et meilleures pensions,
meilleurs équipements
et voitures. Lŕ, on peut męme pas
payer les heures sup'.
Vous leur avez parlé
du professionnalisme ?
En théorie, on paie les pros,
- c'est pour ça qu'on les appelle ainsi.
- Commissaire.
Il y a un problčme ŕ l'arričre.
Si ça t'emmerde, arrange-les.
- Va te faire foutre, petit !
- Toi-męme !
Elle était déjŕ bousillée
quand je l'ai eue ŕ minuit.
Alors, tu l'arranges ou tu dis
ŕ l'équipe de nuit de le faire.
Nettoie-moi ça.
Va te faire foutre, Gene.
La laisse pas comme ça pour le suivant.
C'est toi qui pleures
comme une petite merde, Bobby.
En tant que sergent-chef,
je dois arręter ça ?
C'est ma bagnole.
Vous croyez
que ça va leur remonter le moral ?
Ces gars-lŕ n'ont pas eu
de réelles payes depuis des semaines.
On a aucune morale, sergent.
Ce gosse nous a fait tourner en rond
une demi-heure.
Incroyable, hein ?
C'est parti.
- On a une réunion.
- Tu veux que je vienne ?
Va surveiller ton coin de rue.
Je te ferai signe si c'est OK.
Il bouge.
<i>Lester, tu es lŕ ?</i>
En haut de Reiserstown derričre Chris.
Marlo bouge.
On le suit ?
Pourquoi ?
On sait oů il va.
Non, monsieur.
On l'a déjŕ coupé jusqu'ŕ l'os.
Les voitures seront en service
le mois prochain.
Tant qu'on le peut,
on retarde les payes des heures sup'.
Comment va le crime ?
Comment sont vos stats ?
La baisse ŕ 2 chiffres que vous vouliez,
impossible avec ces compressions.
Bon Dieu, montrez-nous
quelque réduction.
- J'ai fait campagne lŕ-dessus.
- Et les heures sup' retardées ?
On paiera quand on peut.
Et les augmentations, c'est d'actualité,
mais avec un an de retard.
Lŕ, chaque dollar
doit aller pour les écoles,
mais dites ŕ vos hommes
que j'ai pas oublié mes promesses.
Oů encore vous pouvez économiser ?
Nous menons une longue enquęte
concernant les cadavres que nous avons
retirés des maisons, l'an passé.
Des mois de surveillance.
Des milliers d'heures prestées.
Et pour l'instant,
on est loin d'une arrestation.
Vous dites vouloir renoncer
ŕ une enquęte
concernant 22 personnes tuées, laissées
en pourriture dans les maisons ?
Il y avait
une couverture médiatique nationale.
L'année derničre.
Je ne veux pas entendre dire
que nous renonçons ŕ ces meurtres.
Je veux pas voir ce titre.
Mais vu notre situation fiscale,
nous pourrions...
suspendre provisoirement l'enquęte,
en attendant de voir.
- Autre chose ?
- Nous devons
renoncer au quota de 10 heures
concernant les emplois d'appoint.
Vous faites ça et vos policiers
ne feront plus leur boulot.
Ils surveilleront les magasins d'alcool
et les boîtes de nuit.
Sauf votre respect,
le moral est au plus bas.
Vous devez leur lancer un os.
Ou vous pourriez
les perdre pour de bon.
Soyez patients...
et nous y arriverons.
Je vous le promets.
Dis-le, Norman.
Tu le penses.
La vérité au pouvoir, Norman.
C'est pour ça que tu es lŕ.
Quand le gouverneur a mis
ces 50 millions sur la table,
- tu aurais dű les prendre.
- Et adieu au poste
de gouverneur.
En réduisant les effectifs de police,
le crime reste élevé,
pas de poste non plus.
Il sera juste le fragile maire
d'une ville fauchée.
- Tu te sens mieux ?
- Un peu, oui.
Et toi ?
Le mec a cédé.
Il prend notre came ŕ 60/40.
Il a pas résisté.
- D'autres peuvent se pointer ?
- Clairement.
Pas besoin de tragédie pour sa bętise.
- Les condés sont toujours ŕ ton cul ?
- T'es toujours dans leur ligne de mire.
Y avait le Blanc aux cheveux noirs
sur le toit, sur Booker T. Washington.
Il observait avec ses jumelles.
Les p'tits l'ont vu monter.
On fera comme on a dit.
C'est tout.
Tout ça pour échanger quelques mots.
Comment mettre ça sur écoute ?
Lester ? C'est bon pour aujourd'hui ?
<i>Tu veux pas rester sur Chris,
voir oů il va aprčs ?</i>
On est sur lui depuis des mois.
Il fait pas de faux pas.
Et on verra pas nos heures sup'.
<i>C'est bon.</i>
Bien reçu.
Gaz ŕ effet de serre, ici.
Marcus, t'as un compte pour moi ?
- Spider, t'as un compte pour moi ?
- Pour toi ? Non.
Ça tourne ?
Je sais pas trop.
Ils sont ŕ court ?
Je sais juste qu'ils me disent rien.
Gaz ŕ effet de serre...
Rentre.
Bug va bientôt sortir d'école.
Je suis pas comme toi.
Va chercher Bug. On se voit ce soir.
On est ŕ court ?
Non, ça va.
Il en reste 60 sur 1 400.
On gčre, Mike.
- Pourquoi tu l'as pas dit ŕ Duke ?
- Hein ?
Pourquoi tu te fous de Duke ?
Je me fous de personne, mec.
Il fait sa pute,
c'est tout.
Le gaz ŕ effet de serre, c'est chaud.
Ils font preuve d'un peu de négligence.
Ils se sont rencontrés au męme lieu
- utilisé 2 fois la semaine derničre.
- Ŕ McCulloh.
C'est plutôt mince depuis le temps
qu'on est sur eux, Lester.
Ils vont se relâcher,
tomber dans une routine.
Comme tous, quand leur heure arrive.
- On a parlé d'heures sup' ?
- Sérieux,
on va ętre payés que 8 heures sur 14.
Des dépenses décentes
font aboutir les enquętes.
On m'a appris ça.
180 heures non soldées.
Encore 2 semaines,
ça fera un mois de travail.
2 semaines et je serai en prison
pour non-paiement de pension.
Qui veut boire un coup ?
Putain. Qui payera, mon salaud ?
Je payerai une ou deux tournées.
Et moi, j'en boirai une ou deux...
Et un débarcadčre, hein ?
Et le belvédčre, lŕ ?
Pour ma femme.
Des nouvelles sur quand les heures sup'
seront ŕ nouveau payées ?
Car on fait du double service
sur ces surveillances.
Ils ne m'ont rien dit.
Je dois ętre sur la touche.
Il faut arręter l'enquęte, colonel.
Expliquez-moi
comment on obtient 22 cadavres.
- Expliquez.
- C'est un ordre de la mairie.
Un an de travail
de mes meilleurs agents,
et on abandonne ?
Colonel, il n'y a pas eu de paye décente
depuis plus d'un mois.
Mais oů est Carcetti ?
Il nous a promis un jour nouveau.
Il se collette avec les écoles.
Et nous, nous sommes en suspens.
Le maire m'a personnellement fait
des promesses.
Si vous voulez un martyr
au nom de ce service,
- n'hésitez pas.
- Tant qu'on y est,
tâchez de rendre
votre voiture de fonction.
Le chargé du budget a appelé il y a 1 h,
nous disant de retirer les véhicules
des colonels et grades inférieurs.
Attends. Regarde.
Si tu le mets lŕ, je vais gagner.
Le petit bonhomme sort le grand jeu.
Yo, Duke.
Je réfléchissais.
T'as pas besoin de bosser dans la rue
si t'as pas envie.
T'en fais assez ici avec Bug
pour ętre payé.
Comment ça ?
Je veux dire, ŕ t'occuper de lui.
Et je me disais,
si tu te faisais serrer,
qu'en serait-il de Bug ?
Tu vois ?
Qui surveillera ton coin de rue
le matin ?
Je pensais promouvoir Spider,
voir comment il s'en sort
pendant une semaine.
Donc, je serai une sorte de nounou ?
Je ferai quoi
pendant que Bug est ŕ l'école, nettoyer
la cuisine et faire des cookies ?
Fais ce que tu veux, yo.
Avant qu'il rentre, tu es libre.
Tu m'as battu.
J'y crois pas.
Tu m'as battu.
C'est des sales menteurs,
des enculés de menteurs.
Du calme, garçon.
J'étais heureux en patrouille.
J'allais bien.
Tu t'ennuyais.
Non ! J'étais heureux.
Ces enculés viennent me voir
et me disent :
"C'est un jour nouveau, Jimmy",
racontant
que ça allait changer.
Ça ne change jamais.
S'ils m'avaient laissé
quand Marlo utilisait les portables,
je l'aurais eu y a un an.
Tu vois ?
Mais ils peuvent pas bien agir.
Ils savent pas faire.
On est de nouveau sur Marlo.
On doit le surveiller ŕ plein temps.
Mais ils payent plus les heures sup',
et ont vendu
notre meilleur fourgon de surveillance.
On peut toujours ręver pour...
obtenir un nouvel appareil...
- photo numérique.
- Ils veulent économiser.
Bunko ŕ la traîne.
Bunky Bunk, viens lŕ.
- Jimmy.
- Viens lŕ, bęte virile.
Allez, Bunk. Offre-moi un verre, salope.
Avec quoi ?
J'imaginais que les patrons
auraient au moins trouvé
comment payer la Criminelle.
Pete, amčne-toi.
Prends-moi ça.
Je te paye 50 cents le dollar
en échange de ma note.
- Que du liquide.
- Une fois payés,
- tu doubleras ton fric.
- La ville ne pourra jamais rembourser.
Comment on va payer ?
On peut toujours dévaliser
une boutique d'alcool.
G & L sur Edmondson. Plexiglas fin.
Je m'occupe du mec au guichet.
- Je te couvre.
- Je me charge de la porte.
Qui prendra le volant ?
Chaque plan a son maillon faible.
Paraît qu'ils ferment les bureaux
ŕ l'étranger : Joburg, Beijing, tous.
Paraît que les licenciements,
ce sera comme ŕ Phila.
Foutaises. Ils vont pas licencier.
Ce sera d'abord des rachats.
S'ils en ont pas assez,
ils vont licencier.
Qu'en avez-vous ŕ foutre ?
Vous, avec l'ancienneté.
Ce serait dommage de virer toutes
les minettes de la salle de rédac'.
Sale putain de dégénéré.
Klebanow aime bien embaucher
ces jolies jeunettes, hein ?
23, 24 ans, mince, longs cheveux raides
et grands yeux brillants.
Et la moitié ne sait écrire un essai.
Notre estimé directeur
de la rédaction
favorise un certain genre, hein ?
- Messieurs.
- Point d'interrogation.
Un jour...
je voudrai savoir ce que c'est
de travailler pour un vrai journal.
- Quoi ? J'ai des appels.
- Tu te mets ŕ écrire maintenant,
et je ne serai pas lŕ ŕ 22 h
ŕ retravailler ton accroche.
- Retravailler mon accroche ?
- Allez, Fletch,
tâche d'ętre pręt ŕ la 2e édition
pour une fois.
- Rien sur la réunion du conseil ?
- Si.
Je vais recouper avec du récent.
Pour la 3e édition.
Ils vont voter une ordonnance
sur les SDF.
Pas sűr.
Nerese fait du bruit comme si
elle allait la renvoyer ŕ la commission.
Enfin, trouve-moi une info quelque part.
North Avenue ?
Quelque chose brűle.
Vous vous demandez
ce que ça peut ętre ?
Je ne suis pas le chargé ŕ la police.
Mais tu as appelé Twigg, hein ?
Il est éditorialiste.
Il est payé pour rester assis.
C'est quoi, ton excuse ?
Il est en salle fumeurs.
Appelle-le sur son portable.
Quel genre de personne reste planté
ŕ regarder un incendie ?
C'est bien honteux, ça.
Oů préféreriez-vous ętre,
hein, les petits ?
Salut, Gus.
Jay.
L'AP a un truc sur de nouvelles
réductions sur les lignes de bus.
- Ne dis pas.
- <i>Daily Record</i>
l'avait ce matin.
Ballon d'essai sur les transports.
Le service de l'État s'en charge.
<i>Daily Record</i>...
OK, les gens. Il est 14 heures.
Il me faut les résumés
au cas oů quelqu'un menacerait
de commettre un acte de journalisme.
Service local. Haynes.
Vous avez pas, hein ?
Qu'est-on censé foutre
pour la photo centrale ?
Génial. Splendide.
La photo a pas marché
pour le champ de courses.
Et la conférence de presse
de Hopkins, on l'a ?
On avait privilégié la course.
Swag, c'est encore moi.
- Quelque chose brűle ŕ Baltimore Est.
- <i>Ah oui ?</i>
- Surprends-moi avec une belle photo.
- <i>Je tâcherai.</i>
Écoutez. Ce qu'on a,
c'est la violence due ŕ la drogue,
et pas qu'un peu. Et vous,
vous avez une loi sur les armes :
5 ans minimum
sans conditionnelle. Il nous faut
baisser notre taux d'homicide.
Surtout depuis que vous avez réduit
le budget de la police.
Nos problčmes de budget sont connus.
Raison de plus
pour le procureur fédéral d'aider.
Officiellement, mes priorités :
contre-terrorisme
et corruption politique.
Comme quand j'ai demandé votre aide
pour les cadavres des maisons vacantes.
Mais je suis enclin ŕ vous pręter
une dizaine d'agents du FBI
et tous les moyens nécessaires
pour cette enquęte,
ŕ condition que nous récupérions
l'affaire Clay Davis.
Notre procureur
a développé cette affaire.
Il décide quoi en faire.
Il semble enclin ŕ garder M. Davis
au niveau de la ville.
Mais si vous pouviez
convaincre M. Bond,
nous pourrions trouver les ressources
pour l'enquęte des cadavres et
du temps pour certaines affaires d'arme.
Sans Clay Davis, vous ętes pręt
ŕ laisser les meurtres continuer.
Le FBI
et le cabinet du procureur fédéral
ne sont pas lŕ pour faire le travail
que votre police ne peut pas faire.
- Ne nous mettez pas en cause.
- Baltimore baigne
dans le sang. S'il ne peut pas
pendre un législateur démocratique,
il s'en fout pas mal.
Et pour protéger ce législateur,
qui est l'un des plus gros extorqueurs
et corrompus de l'État,
vous brűlez tous les ponts.
Vous croyez que je tiens ŕ Clay Davis ?
Je ne le protčge pas.
- Donnez-le.
- Bond décide.
- Parlez-lui.
- Déjŕ fait.
Et il a dit ŕ votre cul de républicain
d'aller se faire enculer ?
Eh bien, je doublerai la mise sur ça.
Bonne chance
pour vos problčmes de criminalité.
Bien passé ?
Tu sais pourquoi il veut tellement
l'enquęte sur Clay Davis ?
Pour piétiner tout le parti démocratique
et aider son connard de pote de golf
républicain ŕ rester 4 ans de plus
- comme gouverneur.
- Donc, Bond
garde l'enquęte pour aider le parti ?
Non. Bond garde
l'enquęte pour que Clay Davis
soit un trophée pour lui-męme.
Mon avis, c'est que notre nouveau
procureur de l'État
veut devenir maire, un jour.
Ça vous coupe la route, Nerese.
Si les fédés récupčrent l'affaire,
alors Bond ne sera pas mis en avant.
Mais, s'ils l'ont et le font parler,
la moitié de l'administration Royce
pourrait tomber.
Vous y compris, peut-ętre.
Ne vous inquiétez pas pour moi.
Vous, vous avez claqué la porte au FBI,
et il nous faut toute l'aide possible.
C'est de leur faute.
Plan cul.
Je suis content de voir
que Marlo a un passe-temps.
Tiens. Emmčne-la dans sa chambre,
tu sais, qu'elle profite du minibar,
mate la télé.
Une fois installée,
va t'occuper de l'autre truc.
Monk me conduira.
Bien. On passe alors ŕ autre chose.
Avec John Hopkins qui achčte tout
au nord de Monument Street
pour tout détruire,
je crois qu'on voit tous la merde
qui se profile ŕ Baltimore Est.
- Oui. Ils virent la téci.
- Yo.
Les négros vont ŕ Baltimore County.
Trčs vite, Baltimore Est
sera plus dans l'Essex.
Il y a déjŕ un marché le long de
la nationale 40 et ŕ Turner's Station.
- Le territoire va ŕ qui le revendique.
- Non. D'ordinaire, oui,
mais lŕ, on a des gars de l'Est
qui sont déplacés.
Il nous faut nous occuper
des plus touchés.
C'est-ŕ-dire toi.
Eh bien, je suis de l'Est,
en grande partie,
mais lŕ, je parle
du Morfal, de Parker et de Ghost,
tu vois, d'autres ŕ part moi.
Hopkins va pas affecter
tes parts de marché, Marlo.
- Donc, pour ceux qui souffrent...
- C'est bon. Je vois.
Laisse un de tes petits tenter
d'exploiter le comté.
Laisse un nouveau tenter le coup.
Sauf ton respect, fils,
mais comment je délčgue
ne concerne pas la coop.
Oui, mais qu'en pense Slim ?
Hein, le grand ?
Pręt ŕ déblayer pour nous ?
Nan. Je suis bien lŕ oů je suis.
Marlo, mec,
tu es un peu hors sujet, lŕ.
- C'était juste une idée.
- Écoute, mec.
- Quel est le pourcentage...
- Fais gaffe ŕ Marlo.
Il magouille une merde.
Ça me fait perdre
huit coins de rue au moins.
Le Morfal,
c'était un excellent emplacement.
Ça m'avait pris six ans
pour constituer ces coins de rue.
Reginald.
Je vais au travail. Tu sais
que je bosse de nuit toute la semaine.
Je pourrais rester en bas, tranquille.
T'as pas ŕ t'en faire.
Tu ne restes pas quand
je ne suis pas lŕ. C'est notre rčgle.
Je suis ton frčre.
J'ai nulle part d'autre oů aller.
La derničre fois, 50 % de ma cuisine
a fini chez le pręteur sur gages.
Tu te rappelles ?
Mais tu peux verrouiller la porte.
Je reste en bas.
Mes rčgles.
Tu as dit.
Le palais de justice ? Putain ?
J'y vais.
Rupert.
Quoi encore ?
Le Grand Banditisme est dissous.
Les inspecteurs
reprennent leurs horaires.
Le commandement m'en a informé hier.
Signé par le maire.
Ils enterrent discrčtement
l'enquęte sur les cadavres
et Marlo Stanfield.
- Problčme de fonds ?
- Ils économisent partout.
Heures de travail, équipements,
analyses labo, parc de véhicules.
Tous les dollars trouvés servent
ŕ colmater le budget de l'école.
Cedric pensait
essayer de raisonner Carcetti,
peut-ętre garder
le détachement Stanfield au moins.
Et l'affaire Clay Davis ?
Ça passe devant le grand jury bientôt.
S'ils renvoient Freamon ŕ la Crim,
je ne l'aurai pas non plus sur ça,
- et Lester est l'affaire.
- Excusez-moi.
- Vous savez oů se trouve le greffier ?
- Criminel ou civil ?
Criminel, assurément.
Au fond, derničre porte.
- Quand voyez-vous le maire ?
- Une heure environ.
Ils m'ont donné 5 minutes
ŕ la fin de sa journée.
Je vous accompagne.
Passez me prendre ŕ mon bureau.
Alors, oů tu vas, lŕ ?
Audition de motions, point 18.
Mon dernier truc pour aujourd'hui.
Et l'État ?
D'autres possibles réductions
budgétaires dans les transports publics.
Un ballon d'essai du gouverneur.
- Du monde d'affecté, non ?
- Si ça a lieu.
- Ce fut déjŕ évoqué.
- Męme,
on peut présenter l'impact potentiel.
La vérité est qu'on suit
le <i>Daily Record</i> sur ça.
Pourquoi on l'a pas eue ?
Si c'est un ballon d'essai...
On est sans chargé aux transports
depuis les rachats,
- donc...
- On devrait la relever.
Probablement, mais...
Chicago sert un peu la ceinture,
c'est pas une raison pour faiblir.
Ça devrait pas affecter
notre capacité
ŕ sortir un excellent produit.
Suffit de faire plus avec moins.
On a plus de ressources
que le <i>Daily Record</i>.
Mais pas de chargé aux transports.
Votre Éminence. On s'encanaille
ŕ la réunion du Métro aujourd'hui ?
- Que savez-vous ?
- Le service local.
Le proc de l'État se plaint de la baisse
de qualité des affaires de police
depuis sa tour.
Conseil municipal ce soir.
On aura sűrement pas de vote sur
les SDF, mais on en tirera de l'info.
Accident mortel sur le périph',
2 meurtres cette nuit,
et un incendie en cours
dans un pavillon de Baltimore.
Pas sűr d'avoir une photo.
Affaires régionales.
On a l'article sur Hopkins
concernant le Biomed,
mais pas de photos sur la conférence
de presse d'aujourd'hui,
et deux feuillets du correspondant
ŕ College Park sur la fac respectant pas
- ses quotas de déseg.
- On m'a dit que,
chiffres mis ŕ part, le campus est bien
plus accueillant envers les minorités.
Que ça s'est amélioré.
- Ah bon ?
- Vous savez peut-ętre,
Gene Robbins est
le doyen du journalisme lŕ-bas.
J'ai déjeuné avec lui l'autre jour.
- Néanmoins, ils n'ont pas...
- Il disait
comment les derničres années
avaient vraiment transformé
la réputation de l'école vis-ŕ-vis
des enseignants et des étudiants noirs.
C'est un Blanc ?
- Qui ?
- L'homme du journalisme...
Dean Wormer, Dean Martin...
J'ai travaillé
avec Gene Robbins ŕ Philadelphie.
C'est un excellent journaliste
et une source fiable.
Ça va au-delŕ de la race.
Alors, gardons l'article sur la déseg
le temps d'envoyer quelqu'un
enquęter davantage,
vraiment voir comment l'Université du
Maryland est perçue par les minorités.
Bien. On solidifie les sujets,
on voit oů on en est dans une heure.
Pourquoi lui donner un coup de bâton ?
Tu sais qui est Gene Robbins.
Qui frappe ? Quand j'ai un avis
sur un article, je le donne.
Une rédaction saine,
c'est un lieu magique
oů l'on débat de tout constamment.
- Je frappe personne.
- "Dean Martin" ?
D'accord, un petit coup.
<i>Prévenu plaide coupable
Condamné ŕ perpétuité</i>
Il passait pas devant le tribunal.
L'accusation pour port d'arme
a été reportée deux fois.
Alors, c'était quoi, ce bordel ?
Tu te souviens du Russe
qu'on a enfermé pour meurtre,
l'affaire du port ?
J'étais pas avec vous sur cette enquęte.
Donc, non, je ne me souviens pas.
Chris Partlow, si.
Purée. Mlle Gutierrez.
Amčne tes fesses.
Tu dis que 120 personnes
ont été évacuées.
- Oui. Exact.
- On peut pas évacuer des gens.
Enfin, si, si tu veux,
mais il faut pas dire ça.
Un immeuble peut ętre évacué.
Évacuer une personne
revient ŕ lui faire un lavement.
Les détails, Mlle Gutierrez.
Au <i>Baltimore Sun</i>,
Dieu habite toujours dans les détails.
- Apprends-leur, Spry.
- Que va-t-on faire
de ces enfants de nos jours ?
Putain de bordel.
Une autre poupée brűlée.
Encore Carlyle.
- <i>Photo.</i>
- Swag,
je regarde un incendie de Baltimore Est.
J'ai une Barbie brűlée au 1er plan.
J'aurais pu te croire si c'était pas
Carlyle qui avait pris la photo.
Impossible que je croie ŕ ça.
Imprime-moi autre chose.
Dans ses photos d'incendie,
y a toujours celle d'une poupée brűlée
quelque part dans les décombres.
J'imagine ce bobardeur
avec son putain de harem de poupées
ŕ verser de l'essence sur chacune.
Tu fouilles son coffre,
t'en trouves toute une collection.
Ton accroche ?
Le conseil retarde le vote sur les SDF
sur ordre de Carcetti.
Pour pas donner l'image
qu'il chasse les SDF du centre-ville,
Nerese rédige ŕ nouveau la mesure.
Il a raison.
On n'évacue pas les gens.
Laisse tomber.
- De bons sujets ?
- Ce que les flics de jour ont raté.
Un accident mortel et une fuite de gaz.
Des brčves, hein ?
Une journée calme jusque-lŕ.
Ville de merde pour les infos.
Tu trouves ?
Combien d'articles
deviennent nationaux ? Pas beaucoup.
Les cadavres dans les maisons
l'an dernier. Grosse couverture.
Et ça n'a pas męme été résolu.
L'article tenait pas debout.
Depuis, quoi d'autre ?
Jeff !
Jeffy Jeff.
Quoi ?
Viens voir. Purée.
Quoi encore ?
Écouté les projets de loi
sur le découpage ?
Non. Je suis revenu écrire.
Vérifie la bibliothčque.
Męme les coupures de journaux.
Ça remonte.
Non. Ou plutôt, tu retournes
ŕ la mairie assister au vote.
Découvre qui a présenté ça,
si Carcetti,
Nerese ou je sais pas qui
est derričre ça. Tu les lâches pas.
- Découvre ce qui se passe.
- Pourquoi ? Qui est Ricardo Hendrix ?
Un dealer. Rick la Grosse Bouille.
Alma, Scott.
C'est un bar ŕ nichons
sur Baltimore Street
que la ville veut
pour la ZDE de Howard Street.
Mais l'autre propriété
qu'ils veulent échanger avec lui,
je veux savoir ce qu'il en est.
Ils échangent des propriétés
avec un dealer ?
Oui. Il a un casier long comme
ton bras. Et quelques condamnations.
File. Chope de bonnes citations.
Alma.
Va ŕ cette adresse.
Un club de strip-tease
appelé Desperado.
Tu demandes le proprio.
Il s'appelle Ricardo Hendrix.
Tu lui dis que sans son commentaire,
sa photo fera la une tous les jours.
C'est qui ?
C'est un dealer. Mais au vu de ça,
il a magouillé un truc ŕ la mairie.
Qu'il nous dise pourquoi il échange
de propriété avec la ville,
ce qu'il pourrait gagner
sur cette affaire.
Que veux-tu que je fasse ?
Sors les coupures de journaux,
vérifie les dossiers de la nécro,
écris ŕ l'avance l'article sur Ricardo.
Elle va dans des boîtes de strip-tease
et moi, je me tape la nécro ?
- En retard pour le conseil ?
- Nous vous attendions.
Moi ? Je suis en retard
pour un truc de charité au Walters.
M. le Maire, on m'a dit
que j'aurais quelques minutes.
- C'était prévu ?
- Tout a pris du retard.
- Ils devaient vous appeler.
- Faites vite,
ou on remet ça ?
Burrell a dissous la brigade
qui enquęte sur les cadavres.
- Quand on aura de l'argent, on reprend.
- Les enquętes,
ce n'est pas ça. Vous ne pouvez pas
arręter et reprendre plus tard sans...
Colonel, on n'a plus un rond.
On ne peut rien faire
- avant la nouvelle année fiscale.
- Mais, Tommy,
ça me tue Clay Davis,
et on va le faire passer
- devant un grand jury.
- C'est la męme brigade ?
Il me faut une marque
pour mes affaires.
Combien d'éléments vous faut-il ?
Deux inspecteurs.
Je dirai ŕ Rawls que vous pouvez
garder 2 hommes pour Clay. Le reste
est arręté le temps de renflouer.
Je dois filer.
Alors comme ça, un politicien véreux
bat 22 macchabées.
Bon ŕ savoir.
Pour économiser, on a męme pas
de voitures opérationnelles.
Plus de patrouilles ŕ 2.
- Purée, oů est allé le fric ?
- Aux écoles.
Carcetti a épargné les profs,
donc il nous encule.
On dirait que tu es parti
au bon moment, hein ?
Regarde-toi.
Voici notre Thomas arborant la derničre
tendance des tenues d'affaires.
Un ensemble discret
expliquant les deux t de distinction.
Y a deux t ŕ distinction ?
Sérieusement, tu as bonne mine, Herc.
Je m'en sors bien, mec.
J'ai du boulot de partout.
Une fois la chose sue, ces putains
d'avocats ont surgi de partout.
Ça me fait rappeler.
J'ai besoin d'infos sur un nom.
PV, plaque et téléphone.
Pendant que vous y ętes,
une photo de casier.
Car je paie la prochaine tournée.
Putain, pas trop tôt !
J'ai pas l'habitude d'avoir du fric.
J'ai tendance ŕ oublier. Une tournée !
Comment est la brčve ?
C'est net et ça a du mordant.
Mérite la une. 2e article, peut-ętre.
- Et on dit quoi ?
- Que c'est un bon petit marché
pour un proprio de bar ŕ nichons
ancien criminel.
Il vend son emplacement actuel
ŕ la ville pour 1,2 million.
Ils lui revendent un meilleur bâtiment
pour déménager son club
5 rues ŕ l'ouest
pour 200 000.
Il se fait un million
en restant ŕ l'écart.
- Contrepartie ?
- On épluche
les donateurs
du comité de campagne de Nerese.
Jusque-lŕ,
on a 40 000 de Ricardo Hendrix
et un groupe utilisant l'adresse du bar.
- Ce n'était pas dans votre résumé.
- On l'a trouvée...
Jeff Price l'a trouvée cachée dans
les projets de loi sur le découpage,
ŕ la fin de l'ordre du jour du conseil.
Il l'a repérée en retard,
mais il l'a repérée.
Bien. En une, sous le pli.
Service métro, Phelps.
Gus, Price pour toi,
ligne 2. Et il a Nerese avec lui.
Putain, et voilŕ.
Gus ? C'est Jeff.
La présidente du conseil
aimerait te parler.
- <i>Officiellement ?</i>
- Non. Elle m'a répondu.
- C'est officieusement.
- <i>Passe-la-moi.</i>
C'est parfaitement légal.
Sans aucun doute, Mme la présidente.
Cela touche ŕ la rénovation.
Il est dans l'intéręt de la ville de
permettre ŕ M. Hendrix de déménager.
Ainsi que de lui donner une propriété
avec deux fois plus d'espace
plus un million de dollars
pour le dérangement ?
Pensez-vous que le conseil a compris
que M. Hendrix
a fait un don de 60 000 dollars
ŕ votre comité de campagne ?
Je ne sais pas, madame.
Lŕ oů je vis, avec 60 000,
on achčte plein de bonne volonté.
Jeff, c'est toi ?
Je te mets en attente pour Spry.
Donne-moi
le discours officiel de Nerese.
Dommage qu'on puisse pas utiliser
ce qu'elle vient de nous donner.
Tu as quoi ?
Continue d'éplucher
les financements de campagne.
Y a au moins 20 000 $ en contributions
qu'on a pas encore trouvé.
Nerese vient de le confirmer.
Je reviens de suite.
Salut. C'est moi.
On va tarder ce soir.
Je vais bien.
Mais non.
Je suis fatigué, c'est tout.
Je marmonne quand je suis fatigué.
Voilŕ tout.
Bonne nuit.
<i>Blue tops</i>, ça roxe.
<i>Blue tops</i>,
dépęchez-vous d'en prendre.
Bubs.
Yo.
Hauk.
C'était un super coup, ŕ la limite.
Dčs qu'un politicien de Baltimore
te traite de salopard,
c'est une bonne nuit. Pas vrai ?
C'était une bonne citation d'Alma,
qui l'a obtenue de Rick la Grosse
Bouille pour le coup de circuit.
"Je suis un homme d'affaires. La ville
veut m'aider, volontiers." Joli.
- Comment tu l'as fait parler ?
- Je suis entrée, me suis assise,
regardé les danseuses quelques
minutes, et il est venu vers moi.
Il pensait que je voulais postuler.
Tu mérites plus que d'ętre citée.
Je sais pas. C'est déjŕ bien.
On va pas loin avec ça.
Oů tu veux aller ?
<i>Times</i> ou <i>Post</i>. Oů d'autre ?
Je sais pas.
C'est quand męme un bon journal.
J'en ai moi-męme parlé au maire.
Mais ils privilégient les patrouilles
et la baisse de la criminalité.
Et ętre sur Marlo et ses gars
tous les jours
depuis un an n'a pas fait baisser
la criminalité ?
On a baissé le nombre de tués
rien qu'en les épiant.
- Ils se savaient surveillés, hein ?
- Au bout d'un an ?
Des promesses m'ont été faites
également.
On m'a dit
que ce serait un jour nouveau.
Ce n'est clairement pas le cas.
On va oů, alors ?
McNulty et vous,
vous retournez ŕ la Crim.
Dozerman, provisoirement ŕ la Tactique.
Lieutenant. Vous allez
pourvoir un poste dans le Nord,
horaire de 16 h ŕ minuit.
Freamon, Sydnor, vous ętes affectés
au cabinet du procureur de l'État
pour passer l'affaire Clay Davis
devant le grand jury.
Quand l'argent commencera ŕ affluer,
je vous réaffecterai tous
dans cette brigade.
Navré.
Je me demande ce que ça fait
de travailler pour une vraie police.
50 cent.
50 cent.
Merci bien.
<i>Une transaction de la ville
rapporte 1 million $ ŕ un dealer</i>
Vous l'avez appris quand hier soir ?
Gus l'a vue sur l'ordre du jour
du conseil vers 21 h 30.
C'est un putain de bon article.
- Oui.
- Qui s'occupe des réactions ?
Jeff. Pourquoi ?
Il me faut un sujet. Je suis pręt.
Garde la niaque.
Les bonnes choses arrivent
quand elles arrivent.
Il est 14 heures, les gens.
Il me faut les résumés.
Il y a des millions de sujets
dans la ville nue,
mais aujourd'hui, bande de truffes,
vous devez m'en passer que 3 ou 4.
Les Orioles se payent pas de lanceur.
- J'aurais jamais dű quitter le Bronx.
- Tu as vu ?
- Quoi ?
- Un de nos clients
ŕ la une.
On représente Tiger Woods ?
Ça m'a coűté qu'une tournée de bičres.
Ils me kiffent au service.
Je suis un martyr.
J'arręte un pasteur noir, je l'énerve,
et je perds mon putain de boulot.
Une seule tournée ?
Toi, un éminent enquęteur
de la défense,
tu as laissé ces autres gars
payer une tournée ?
Petit,
il est temps que tu apprennes un petit
truc sur les frais de représentation.
C'est mon bureau.
Tu racontes quoi, lŕ ?
Le fils prodigue.

{\c&HFFFFFF&}Transcript : FRM
You see now?
I'm here to tell you,
this remaining silent shit
ain't nothing like
they make it out to be.
You up in here
all tight with it,
waiting for your paid lawyer,
thinking you all wise,
ain't you?
No. See,
that worked when you some kind of
criminal mastermind...
When you ain't been seen
runnin' from the deed.
When your own fuckin'
running partner
ain't in the next room,
putting you in.
He's telling it
like a little bitch.
We even went to mickey d's for him
because he was so motherfucking helpful.
2 quarter pounders, big fries,
McDonaldland cookies,
Dr. Pepper.
That's how your boy roll, right?
All right.
Step out.
- Where are we going?
- Break room.
So you can enjoy that, huh?
All right.
But I still ain't sayin' shit to you.
Marnell, what the fuck?
How many years you figure
we've been doing the same shit?
20 at least.
True.
True.
False.
Load him up.
- Some shit actually works, huh?
- Hell yeah.
Americans are a stupid people,
by and large.
We pretty much believe
whatever we're told.
So it can feel my heart beat?
Pulse? Yeah.
If Marnell say
I had the gun, he lying.
The machine tells the tale, son.
We ready, professor?
We'll start with an easy one.
Is your name in fact
DeShawn Fredericks?
Yeah.
True.
And do you reside in fact
the 1200 block of woodyer street
in west Baltimore?
Yeah.
- True.
- And did you and Marnell
shoot your boy Pookie
down on Cary Street
just like Marnell said you did?
No. No.
Lie.
You lying motherfucker.
Machine is never wrong, son.
Fuck, man!
Nigger can't never keep
his damn mouth shut.
I should've busted a cap
in Pookie ass my own self.
Left Marnell home and shit.
He just a bitch, is all.
The bigger the lie,
the more they believe.
First the BlackBerry.
Oh, he brought his tunes.
All the running shit
pay, don't it?
We got one coming in.
Unidentified number-one male.
- <i>You got him, Jimmy?</i>
- Yeah. More face-to-face.
Oh, man.
You know, this would be more fun
if we were actually getting paid.
Hey, you know,
I heard a story about you,
- when I was back in the west.
- It's not true.
- Haven't even told it yet.
- Whatever it is, it's not true.
You run a Vice undercover one time,
and instead of pulling up,
you went ahead and closed the deal.
I read this report where
you got blowed by this whore,
and you actually wrote it
that you got blowed.
You believe everything you read?
Look, man.
All I'm saying,
if I'm gonna take your package,
split me and be fair.
I got to pay all my people the same,
and here you're upping the price on me.
- Pay your people less.
- They my people, though.
Then short yourself.
Split is 60/40.
You want better?
You need to tool up.
And wait for Chris, Snoop,
and the rest of my people
come pay a call on your people.
We will be brief
with all you motherfuckers.
I think you know.
All right.
Northbound on Fulton.
Lester. Coming your way.
I see him.
<i>Roger that.</i>
Every day, same shit.
- Look at this pretty bitch.
- Ten-hut!
Just sit the fuck down.
I'm not gonna stand up here
and pretend to be insulted
because you all are pretending
to respect the rank.
Today, he's an S.I.C.
Tomorrow, he might be
a newly minted Lieutenant.
You never know with these
career-minded motherfuckers, do you?
If I was minding my career,
would I be in the western in command
of you useless fucking humps?
Okay, let's go to the readouts
and the warrants first.
- Fuck the readouts.
- Fuck the warrants.
What the fuck
is going on with our hours?
Easy, easy. If I had an answer,
you'd have an answer.
I'm in the same boat as you are.
2-odd weeks since I've seen
overtime or court pay,
and I gotta pay
the credit union,
the archdiocese for my kid's tuition,
and my ex-wife
so she can pay...
Shut the fuck up
and sit the fuck down!
In your fucking seats.
We're still authorizing overtime
and the state's attorneys
are still signing court slips.
But you ain't fucking paying us.
The union says
we're going down to the NLRB
- and deal with this shit.
- Word coming down
is that when the city's budget
situation is improved,
we'll all see that
as back pay or comp time.
- Every last hour.
- Back pay my ass.
This shit here is just paper.
65 hours of worthless paper
right here!
Officer brown, sit your ass.
Sit!
We're all professionals.
We're about to police
the roughest district
in one of the roughest cities
in the world.
Show some pride.
If promises were made,
promises will be kept.
The situation in the city
right now is bad,
but it won't stay bad forever.
We wait this out
like professionals.
Now, then.
Back to the readouts.
First item is from motor pool.
No marked or unmarked units
can be shopped on dickman street
- until further notice.
- What?
Cutbacks and fleet budgeting
require that all districts
make do with vehicles
in their current state of affairs.
So that means--
Shitbox cars
are falling apart.
Fucking know that?
<i>Where you at?</i>
<i>On his ass.</i>
You guys got the eyeball.
<i>All good, Lester.</i>
<i>It's all good.</i>
<i>Officer castor,
you have a call on line 79...</i>
- Natives are restless, huh?
- I don't know
how long we go before
the wheels fall off the car.
A year ago, they were promised
pay raises, pension bumps,
better equipment, better cars.
Now we can't even pay the o.t.
Gave them
the professionalism bit, right?
In the real world,
they pay professionals.
- That's why we call them pros.
- Major.
There's a problem on the back lot.
If it bothers you, clean them up.
- Fuck you, son.
- Fuck you right back.
That thing was all fucked up
when I got it for midnight.
- You ask anyone.
- Then, you clean it,
or you get the midnight shift
to clean it.
Clean this.
Fuck you, Gene. You don't leave it
like that for the next man.
You're the one
whining like a little bitch, Bobby.
As S.I.C., should I stop this?
That's my car.
What, you think this is
good for morale or something?
These guys haven't had
an honest paycheck in weeks.
We have no fucking morale, Sergeant.
Kid ran us around for half an hour.
Amazing, ain't it?
Here we go.
He got a meeting.
Want me to come?
You go check on your corner.
I'll send word if it's on.
- He's moving.
- All right.
<i>Lester, are you there?</i>
Up on Reisterstown with Chris.
Marlo's on the move.
Should we follow him?
Why?
We know where he's going.
No, sir.
We've cut it to the bone already.
Cars are gonna go in service
for the next month.
And for as long as
we can get away with it,
we're deferring all overtime
and court pay.
How's crime?
How are your stats?
It's a double-digit decline you wanted.
Not possible with these cuts.
For God sake, you got to
show us some kind of reduction.
I campaigned on that.
All this deferred overtime.
We'll pay it as we can.
And the pay raises I promised?
They're still coming,
just a year late.
Right now I got to throw
every dollar at the schools,
but you tell your people
I know I made promises.
Where else can you guys trim?
Well, we...
We've been running
a prolonged investigation...
into all the--
the bodies we pulled out
of those houses last year.
Months of surveillance.
Thousands of man-hours.
At this point,
we're not close to an arrest.
You're saying you want us
to come down on a case
in which 22 people were murdered
and left to rot in city houses?
We caught national news coverage
on those murders.
Last year.
I don't want anyone saying
we're giving up on those murders.
I don't want to see that headline.
But given our fiscal situation,
we could...
temporarily suspend the investigation
pending new developments.
- Anything else?
- We need to take away
the 10-hour cap
on secondary employment.
You do that and your police
aren't doing police work,
they're guarding liquor stores,
bouncing nightclubs, putting up drywall.
Respectfully,
morale is at rock bottom.
You need to throw
our people a bone.
Or you could lose them for good.
Hold the line now...
And we'll get to a better place.
I promise.
Say it, Norman.
You're thinking it.
Truth to power, Norman.
Isn't that
what I keep you around for?
When the governor threw
that 50-some million on the table,
- you should've picked that shit up.
- He takes the state bailout
- and he never becomes governor.
- He shorts
the police department,
the crime rate stays up,
he ain't no governor, neither,
just a weak-ass Mayor
of a broke-ass city.
Feel better?
A little bit.
You?
Boy folded it up.
He taking our shit 60/40.
- Nigger showed no heart at all.
- So more people
- could stand down there, right?
- Definitely.
Won't be needing no drama
behind his nonsense.
And po-po's still up on you, huh?
You are hot all the time, man.
Today they got the white boy
with black hair up on the roof
on Booker T. Washington.
Watching with his spyglass.
The young 'uns
saw him climbing up. Yeah.
So we do like this, then.
That's it.
All of that so he could
swap a few words.
How do you wiretap that?
Lester?
Are we done for the day, man?
<i>You don't want to stay on Chris,
see where he goes next?</i>
We've been on this guy for months.
- He doesn't slip.
- And no one's kicking our O.T.
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>We're done.</i>
Copy that.
Greenhouse Gas right here.
Hey, Marcus,
you got a count for me?
- Spider, you got a count for me?
- For you? No.
How we do?
I can't say for sure.
They short, huh?
Man, I just know they ain't tell me.
Greenhouse Gas.
Go home, man.
Bug'll be out of school pretty soon.
I ain't you, Michael.
Go get Bug.
I'll see you tonight.
Greenhouse Gas right here.
Yo, we short?
No, we good.
Got 60 left from about 1,400.
We own it, Mike.
So why don't you tell Duke?
Why you fucking with Duke, nigger?
I ain't fucking with nobody, man.
He just acting like a bitch,
that's all.
Greenhouse Gas is hot.
They're getting a little sloppy.
Did that meet in the same lot
they've used twice
in the last week.
The one on McCulloh.
That's pretty thin considering
how long we've been on these guys.
They're gonna get lazy.
Fall into a pattern.
They all do, over time.
Someone say overtime?
Seriously, we did 14 hours
and we're only gonna get paid for 8.
Case has gotta go green
before they go black.
That's how I was taught.
180 hours and counting.
Couple more weeks
and you get a month's work.
Couple more weeks, I'll be in jail
for late payment of child support.
Who needs a taste?
Shit.
Who's buying, motherfucker?
I'll cover a round or two.
Then I guess I'm drinking
a round or two.
Oh, yeah, and a boat dock, huh?
Yeah. And the gazebo here?
For my wife.
You get any word from downtown
on when they're gonna start
paying out the O.T. again?
Because we going double shift
on these surveillances.
They haven't told me anything.
Guess I ain't in the loop.
They have to shut it down, Colonel.
Explain to me how we come up
on 22 bodies.
- Explain that to me.
- This comes straight from the hall.
You're talking about a year's worth
of work by my best people.
To just give up on all of that?
Colonel, we haven't made
an honest payroll in over a month.
Where the fuck is Carcetti?
The man promised us a new day.
He's tangled up
with the schools,
and we're on hold.
The Mayor's made a few
commitments to me personally.
If you want to call in a martyr
on behalf of this department,
- feel free.
- And while you're at it,
see if you can get
your take-home car back.
Budget officer called an hour ago
telling us to relieve colonels and below
of take-home vehicles.
Hold on. Hold on.
See, if you move it here,
then I got you.
Little man bringing it.
Yo, dude...
I've been thinking.
You ain't need to put in time
on the corner if you don't want to.
I mean, you're doing enough here
with Bug to get paid.
How you mean?
I'm saying
looking out for him,
and I've been thinking, like,
if you were to get locked up
for some shit,
how'd it be for Bug, you know?
So, who's gonna watch
your corner in the morning?
Thought I might
promote Spider,
see how he doing
for a week or so.
So, I'd be like a nanny and shit?
What am I gonna do before Bug
get home from school,
clean the stove
and bake some cookies?
Do what you want here, yo.
Before he get home,
time is your own.
You beat me.
Oh, snap, you beat me.
They're fucking liars,
motherfucking liars.
Easy, boy.
I was happy on patrol.
I was fine.
You were bored.
Fuck no. I was happy.
Motherfuckers come to me and say,
"it's a new day, Jimmy,"
talking shit about
how it was gonna change.
Shit never fucking changes.
If they had left me up and running
when Marlo was on them cell phones,
I'd have had him a year ago.
See?
But they can't do the right thing.
It ain't in them.
Now we're back on Marlo's ass.
We need to be on him 24/7.
The motherfuckers cut our overtime,
and they shopped
our best surveillance van.
Don't even think about trying to...
requisition a new fucking
- digital camera.
- They want to do it on the cheap.
Bunko on the prowl.
Hey, bunky Bunk,
come here!
- Jimmy.
- Come here, you virile beast.
Hey, you...
Buy me a drink, you whore.
With what?
I'd have thought the bosses
would've at least figured out
how to keep paying Homicide.
Pete, come on.
Take these slips off me.
I'll pay you 50 cents
on the dollar against my tab.
- Cash only.
- When we get paid,
- you double your money.
- City's never gonna
be healthy enough
to go all that back pay.
How the fuck
are we gonna pay the bar tab?
We could always
knock off a liquor store--
G & L on Edmondson, thin plexi.
I'll take out the counter man.
- I'll cover you.
- I got the door, no problem.
Who's gonna be our wheel man?
Every plan, a weak link.
I heard they're closing
the foreign bureaus--
Joburg, Beijing, everything.
I heard layoffs
as bad as in Philly.
Bullshit.
They're not gonna lay off.
They'll offer buyouts first.
If they don't get enough of those,
they'll go right to layoffs. Watch.
What the fuck you care?
You got all the seniority in the world.
Be a shame
if they have to get rid of all them
- twentysomethings in the newsroom.
- Degenerate motherfucker.
Kleppner sure do like to hire
them sweet, young things, don't he?
23, 24 years old; model-thin;
long, straight hair;
and big, traffic-light eyes.
And half of them can
write a lick, can they?
Yeah. Our esteemed
managing editor
certainly does favor
a certain type, don't he?
Gentlemen...
Question mark.
Someday...
I want to find out what it feels like
to work for a real newspaper.
What? I've got calls out.
You start writing now,
and I'm not here 10:00 tonight
reworking your lead.
- Reworking my lead?
- Come on, Fletch.
Try to make the e-dot deadline
for once in your life.
- Any matter for the council meeting?
- Yeah.
I'll top it with whatever smells fresh,
make the double-dot.
They're gonna vote
on a homeless ordinance, right?
Maybe not.
Naresse is making noises
like she might
throw it back to committee.
Yeah? Well, find me
some news somewhere.
North Avenue?
Something is burning.
You...
You wonder what it might be?
I'm not the police reporter.
But you called Twig, though, right?
At least he's a columnist.
He's paid to sit on his ass.
What's your excuse?
Just left him in
the smoking lounge.
Hit him on his cell.
What kind of people
stand around watching a fire?
Some shameful shit right here.
Where else would you rather be,
huh, kids?
I got it, sir.
Hey, Jay.
A.P. Has got something on more
cutbacks in city bus lines.
- You don't say.
- <i>Daily Record</i>
had it this morning,
MTA trial balloon.
State desk is covering.
<i>Daily Record.</i>
All right, people.
It's 2:00.
I need budget lines in case
anybody is threatening
to commit and act of daily journalism.
City desk. Haynes.
You didn't, huh?
What the fuck are we supposed
to do for centerpiece art?
Great. Wonderful.
Photo didn't get out
for the racetrack piece.
What about art for the Hopkins
press conference? Did we get that?
Scratched it for racetrack.
Hey, Swag, it's me again.
Something is on fire
over in east Baltimore.
Surprise me with a nice,
pretty picture, huh?
Look.
What we have is drug violence
and plenty of it.
What you have
is federal gun statutes that come
with a 5-year minimum, no parole, and,
we need to lower our murder rate.
Especially since you shorted
your police department budget.
It's no secret
we have budget problems,
all the more reason
for the U.S. Attorney to pitch in.
Officially, my priorities
are counterterrorism
and political corruption.
So you told me
when I asked you for help
on those bodies
in the vacant houses.
But I'm inclined to provide you
with a dozen FBI agents
and all the wherewithal
they need to work that case,
but we want Clay Davis
to go federal.
Our state's attorney
has developed that case.
He decides what to do with it.
He seems inclined to keep
Mr. Davis local at this point,
but if you could convince
Mr. Bond to reconsider,
we might find the resources
not only for the probe
of the row house bodies,
but the time to run
some of those gun cases for you.
But unless you get Clay Davis, you're
willing to let the killing continue.
Look. The FBI
and the U.S. Attorney's office
are not here to do the job
that your police department can't.
Don't blame us
for your ineffectiveness.
Baltimore is knee deep in blood.
Unless this guy can hang
a democratic legislator,
- he couldn't give a damn.
- And to protect that legislator,
who happens to be
one of the most corrupt
extortion artists in the state,
you'll burn every last bridge.
Do you think I give a shit about
Clay Davis? I am not protecting him.
- Then give him up.
- It's Bond's call.
- Talk to him.
- I have.
And he told your Republican
ass to go fuck itself, huh?
Well, let me double down on that.
Good luck with your crime problem.
That go well?
You know why he wants
the Clay Davis investigation so bad?
So he can stomp all over
the Democratic party
and help give his asshole
Republican golf buddy another 4 years
- in the Governor's mansion.
- So, Bond
is keeping the case local
to help the party, huh?
No.
Bond is keeping the case so that
Clay Davis can be a trophy for bond.
My guess is, our newly elected
state's attorney
wants to, one day, run for Mayor.
Cuts both ways
for you, Naresse.
If the feds get Clay Davis, then
the case doesn't give bond any profile,
but if they get him
and flip him,
Clay might take
half the Royce administration with him.
You included maybe.
Don't you worry about me.
You, on the other hand,
just slammed the door on the feds,
and we need all the help we can get.
That's on them.
Pussy call.
I'm just glad to know
Marlo has a hobby.
Here.
Take her to her room,
you know,
let her hit the mini bar, watch tv.
When she's settled,
go take care of the other thing.
I use Monk for my ride.
All right. Then moving on
to new business,
with John Hopkins
buying up everything
north of Monument Street
and tearing the shit down,
I think we all see the writing
on the wall in East Baltimore.
Yeah. They moving the 'hood out.
Niggers are going across
the line to Baltimore County.
Pretty soon, East Baltimore
won't be in Essex.
There's a market already along route 40
and down at Turner Station.
- And new territory go to who claim it.
- No. Ordinarily so,
but here, we got some of our
east side people being displaced, right?
I think we need to take care
of those most affected.
Meaning you.
Well, I am east side,
for the most part,
but I'm talking about Hungry Man
and Parker and Ghost,
you know,
others beside myself.
Hopkins ain't gonna affect
your market share, Marlo,
- so for those of us who suffer--
- All right. I see that.
Won't you let one
of your juniors get a shot
to open the county up?
Let a fresh face get a shot at it.
No disrespect, son,
but how I delegate to my lieutenants
is not a co-op concern.
Yeah, but how Slim feel
about that, though?
How you feel, tall man?
Ready to pioneer out there for us?
Naw. I'm good where I am.
Marlo, man,
you're a little out of order here.
Yeah. Well,
- it's just a thought.
- Look, man.
- What's the percentage breakdown...
- Don't sleep on Marlo.
He up to some shit here.
That puts me out 8 corners at least.
Hungry Man,
that was some prime real estate.
It took me 6 years
to build up them corners.
Reginald.
Reginald.
I'm going to work. You know
I got night shift all this week.
You know if you stay down here
quiet like, you ain't need to sweat.
You don't stay here
when I'm not around. That's our rule.
I'm your brother, right?
I got nowhere to go when I leave here.
Last time I left you
alone in my home,
you dragged half my kitchen
to a pawn shop.
Remember that?
But you can keep
the door locked, right?
I'm down here.
My rules.
You said.
The courthouse?
What the fuck?
I'll go in.
Rupert.
What now?
Major Crimes is being disbanded.
The detectives return
to regular rotation.
I got the word yesterday
from command.
The Mayor signed off.
They're quietly deep-sixing
the investigation into the bodies
and to Marlo Stanfield.
- A money thing?
- They're pulling back on everything--
Man hours, equipment,
lab work, motor pool.
Every last dollar we can find
is being shipped over
to plug the school budget.
Cedric thought he would try
to reason with Carcetti,
maybe see if we can keep
the Stanfield detail, at least.
Wait. What about Clay Davis?
That's going to grand jury soon.
If they ship Freamon back to homicide,
I don't have him on that, either,
- and Lester pretty much is that case.
- Excuse me.
- You know where the clerk's office at?
- Criminal or civil?
Criminal, definitely.
End of the hall, last door.
- When are you meeting with the Mayor?
- About an hour.
They gave me a few minutes
on the end of his day.
I'll go with you.
Come by my office and get me.
So, where you off to now?
Motions hearing in part 18.
It's the last thing on my sched.
And for state desk?
Additional cutbacks are said
to be coming in the city MTA routes,
trail balloon from the governor.
- Affects a lot of people, no?
- If it happens.
- They floated this once before.
- Still,
we can go outside
and give them the potential impact.
The truth is we're following
the <i>Daily Record</i> on this one.
Why don't we have that?
If it's a trial balloon--
We've been without a transport reporter
since the last round of buyouts,
- so--
- We should pick that up.
- Probably so, but--
- Just because
Chicago does a little belt-tightening,
there's no reason for us to fall down.
Their cutbacks there
shouldn't affect our ability
to put out an excellent product.
Simply have to do more with less.
Certainly, we have more resources
than the <i>Daily Record</i>.
Though not a transport reporter.
Your Eminence,
slumming at the Metro meeting today?
- What do you know?
- City desk.
State's attorney
complains about the decline
in quality police case work 20 inches
from warm castle.
Got the city council tonight.
Probably won't get a vote
on the homeless initiative,
but we'll scratch some news
out of it somehow.
Two-car fatal on the Beltway,
two overnight murders in the city,
and a fire ongoing
in a Baltimore city row house
for which we may
or may not have art.
Regional affairs.
We have the Hopkins piece on biomed,
though
I'm told we didn't get
art on today's press conference,
and we have 15 inches
from the college park stringer
on U.M.
- not making it's deseg goals again.
- I'm told that,
numbers aside, the campus has become
much more hospitable to minorities.
I'm told that things
have changed for the better.
- Really?
- As you may know,
Gene Robbins is dean
of journalism there.
I had lunch with him
the other day...
- Nevertheless, they haven't--
- And he was saying
how the last few years
have really transformed
the school's reputation
with black faculty and students.
He's a white guy, right?
- Who?
- Journalism fellow--
Dean Wormer,
Dean Martin, whatever his name is.
I worked with
Gene Robbins
in Philadelphia.
He is an excellent journalist
and a reliable source.
I think race is beside the point,
so why don't we hold on the deseg story
until we can assign someone
to do some more reporting,
get a real sense of how U.M.
Is perceived by minorities?
All right, then.
Let's firm things up,
take a look at where we stand
an hour from now.
Why poke him with a stick?
You know who Gene Robbins is.
Who's poking?
If I think something about a story,
I'm gonna speak on it.
You know what
a healthy newsroom is?
It's a magical place where people
argue about everything all the time.
- I'm not poking anyone here.
- "Dean Martin"?
Yeah, a little poke.
Thank you.
I know that wasn't no court date--
He already got the gun charge
postponed twice--
So what the fuck was that about?
Remember that Russian
we locked up for murder,
part of the port case a year back?
I didn't work that case with you, man,
so, no, I don't remember.
Well, Chris Partlow does.
Miss Gutierrez.
Get your ass over here.
You say that 120 people
were evacuated.
- Yeah. They were.
- You can't evacuate people.
I mean, you can, if you want, but
that's not what you want to say here.
A building can be evacuated.
To evacuate a person
is to give that person an enema.
The details, Miss Gutierrez.
At the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>, God
still resides in the details.
- You teach them, Spry.
- What are we gonna do
with these children today?
Fuckety-fuck.
Another burnt doll.
Carlyle again.
- <i>Photo.</i>
- Hey, Swag,
I'm looking at fire from east baltimore
and I got a burnt barbie in foreground.
And I might actually believe you
if it wasn't Carlyle who took the shot.
No fuckin' way I believe in
this picture. Print me something else.
<i>All right.</i>
Every fire photo he brings in
has got to be some burnt doll
somewhere in the debris.
I can see that cheating
motherfucker now
with his fucking harem of dolls
pouring lighter fluid on each one.
You check his fucking truck,
you'll find a whole collection of them.
What's your lead?
Council delays vote on the homeless
initiative at Carcetti's behest.
He doesn't want it looks like the city's
running the homeless out of downtown,
so he asked Naresse
to redraft the measure.
He's right.
You don't evacuate people.
- What?
- Never mind.
- Working on anything good?
- Just what day cops missed.
A fatal in Charles County
and a gas leak downtown.
Briefs, huh?
A quiet day so far.
It's a shit news town.
You think?
How many stories
go national out of here? Not many.
Those bodies in the houses last year.
That got a lot of play.
And they didn't even solve it, right?
The story had no legs at all.
Since then, what else?
Jeff.
Jeffy-Jeff.
What?
Come here.
Jesus Christ.
What now?
Did you stay for the zoning bills?
No.
I came back here to write.
Check the fucking library.
Shit, check the clips, too.
It goes back a ways.
No. Check that. You go back to the hall,
you get the vote on this thing.
Find out who sponsored this.
Find out whether Carcetti or
- Naresse or whoever's behind it.
- You buttonhole them, find out
- what the hell's going on.
- Why?
Who's Ricardo Hendrix?
A drug dealer.
Fatface Rick.
Alma, Scott.
This property
on Baltimore Street is a titty bar
the city wants
for the Howard Street enterprise zone,
but this other property
they want to trade with him,
I want to find out
what that's all about.
This is a drug dealer
they're trading properties with?
Yeah. He's got a record as long as
your arm. A couple convictions, too.
Go, go.
Get some good quotes.
I want you to go to this address.
It's a strip club called Desperado.
You ask around for the owner.
His name's Ricardo Hendrix.
You tell them
until we get a comment,
we're gonna put ricky's picture
on the front page every day.
Who is he?
He's a drug dealer.
But from the look of this,
he's run some sort of game
at city hall.
We want a comment as to why he's
trading property with the city,
what he stands
to make off the deal.
What do you want from me?
Pull clips,
check the morgue files,
write the "A" matter
on Ricardo's history.
Wait. She goes to strip clubs
and I'm pulling clips in the morgue?
You guys late
for the council meeting?
- Looking for you, sir.
- Me? I'm racing them out.
I'm late for some charity thing
at the Walters.
I was told I could
get a few minutes tonight.
- You're on my schedule?
- Everything ran late today.
They were supposed
to ring you, I think.
Do it quick
or do we reschedule?
Burrell's disbanded the unit
that's working the bodies in the houses.
When we're fat with
money, you can come back on it.
Investigations are not like that.
You can't just drop one and then
pick it up down the road without--
We got no money.
We've got no fucking money at all.
There's nothing we can do
until the new fiscal.
But, Tommy,
that kills Clay Davis for me.
We're about to go to grand jury on it.
- Same unit is doing Clay?
- I need some profile for my shop.
How much of that unit do you
need to bring the case in?
A couple of detectives.
I'll tell Rawls you can
keep 2 men for Clay.
The rest of it is shut down
until we're able to dig out, OK?
I got to run.
So one thieving politician
trumps 22 dead bodies.
Good to know.
To save money,
they're not even putting
ops cars in the street.
No more 2-man patrols.
- Jesus, where did the money go?
- Schools.
Carcetti didn't want to lay off
teachers, so he fucks us instead.
Seems like you got out
at the right time, huh?
Look at you.
Here's our boy Thomas
sporting the latest
in downtown businesswear,
an understated ensemble
that puts the "be" in subtle.
There's a "b" in subtle?
Seriously,
you look well, Herc.
I'm doing good, man.
I got more work than I can get to.
It's like once word got around,
these fucking lawyers came out
of the fucking woodwork.
Which reminds me,
I need one of you guys
to run a name for me.
Tags, registration, and phone.
While you're at it,
run a sheeting photo.
Cause, hey, I'm buying
the next round, right?
About fucking time!
Not used to having money.
Kind of forget.
Let's get a round.
How's the brief?
It's clean and it bites.
- Deserves a front, off-lead, maybe.
- And we're saying what?
That it's a sweetheart deal
for a titty bar owner
with a big criminal history.
He sells his existing location
to the city for 1.2 million
and they sell him
a better piece of real estate
to relocate his club
5 blocks west for 200,000.
He clears a million
for laying in the cut.
- What's the quid pro quo?
- We're going through donors
in Naresse's campaign committee
as we speak.
So far, we got 40,000
from Ricardo Hendrix
and a bunch of people all using
the same address as the bar.
- Why wasn't this on your budget?
- Well, we found it--
Actually, Jeff Price found it
hidden in the zoning bills,
bottom of the council agenda.
He caught it late,
but he caught it.
All right, front page,
below the fold.
Metro desk, Phelps.
Gus, Rrice
for you, line 2,
and he's got Naresse with him.
Aw, shit, here it comes.
Gus? It's Jeff.
The council president would like
a word with you.
<i>On the record?</i>
No. She's given me her quote.
- She wants to talk off the record.
- <i>Put her on</i>.
This is all perfectly above board.
No doubt, madam president.
We need this property
for redevelopment
and it's in the city's interest
to allow Mr. Hendrix to relocate.
And is it in the city's
interest to give him a property
with twice as much floor space
and give him a million dollars
for his trouble?
Do you think he might have
made it clear to the council
that Mr. Hendrix donated
$60,000 to your campaign committee?
I don't know, Ma'am.
Where I live, 60,000
buys a lot of good will.
Hey, Jeff, is that you?
I'm putting you on hold for Spry.
Yeah, give me
your on the record for Naresse.
- <i>Ready?</i>
- Yeah.
Shame we couldn't use
what she just gave us.
What do you got?
Keep running through
that campaign finance shit.
There's at least $20,000
in contributions we haven't found yet.
Naresse all but confirmed it.
Yeah, it's me.
We're going late tonight.
I'm fine.
No, I'm not.
I'm just tired is all.
I slur when I'm tired.
That's all.
Yeah.
Night.
Bubs.
Hauk?
That was a great pull at deadline.
Hey, any night
a Baltimore politician
calls you a son of a bitch
is a good night. Am I right?
That was a good pull by Alma,
getting that quote from Fatface Rick
for the home final.
"I'm a businessman.
City wants to help me out,
"I ain't gonna argue."
Sweet.
- Thank you.
- How'd you get him to talk to you?
I just walked in, sat down,
watched the dancers for a few minutes,
and he came over to me.
Thought I was looking for a job.
You deserve more than
a contributing line for that.
I don't know.
A contrib line is cool.
You can't go far on contrib lines.
Where do you want to go?
<i>Times</i> or <i>Post</i>.
Where else?
I don't know.
This is still a pretty good paper.
I brought it
to the Mayor personally,
but they're throwing their last dollars
into patrol and crime suppression.
You think being on Marlo
and his people every damn day
for a year isn't crime suppression?
We lowered the body count
just by sitting on these people.
- They knew they're hot, huh?
- After a year?
Look. Promises
were made to me, as well.
I was told a new day was coming.
Clearly, this isn't it.
Well, where
are we going, then?
You and McNulty are back
to the Homicide rotation.
Dozerman is temporarily
assigned to Tactical.
Lieutenant. You're going
to fill a vacancy in the northern,
4:00-12:00 shift.
Freamon, Sydnor,
you two are assigned
to the State's attorney's office
to help grand-jury
the Clay Davis thing.
When the money starts to flow,
I'll get you all
back on this somehow.
Sorry.
Wonder what it feels like to work
in a real fucking police department.
50 cent.
50 cent.
Obliged.
When did this break last night?
Gus saw it on the council
agenda around 9:30.
It's a good fucking story.
Who's doing the react piece?
Jeff will. Why?
I'm just--
I need a story. I'm up.
Yeah. Stay hungry like that.
Good things come when they come.
It's 2:00, people.
I need budget lines.
There are a million stories
in the naked city,
but today you poor mooks
only need to throw me 3 or 4.
Good afternoon...
The Orioles will not
pay for pitching.
-I should have never left the Bronx.
- You see this?
- What?
- One of our clients
on the front page.
Represent Tiger Woods?
All it cost me was a round of beers.
They fucking love me
in the department.
I'm a fucking martyr
is what I am.
Pull over some black minister,
piss him off,
and I lose my fucking job.
One round?
You, a prominent defense investigator,
let these other guys
buy a round of drinks ever?
OK.
It's time you learned a little something
about the expense account.
That's my desk.
What the fuck you say?
The prodigal son.

Vous savez comment c'est...
J'avais fait une liste
des choses que je ferais pas.
J'ťtais prÍte ŗ faire plein de trucs
pour pouvoir me dťfoncer,
mais je m'ťtais jurť de jamais tapiner.
Une fois que je tapine,
je me dis c'est pas la mort.
Je ferai Áa quelque temps
en me fixant d'autres rŤgles :
utiliser des capotes,
et ne jamais le faire

Disons juste que je m'ťtais dit

Sortez-le de sa retraite.
On peut s'occuper de Áa,
mais lui aussi s'en prendra ŗ nous.
Joe et les autres
avaient dit de laisser couler.
La couronne vaut pas grand-chose
si le gars qui la porte
se fait toujours carotte.
Joe devrait capter Áa.
Qu'il s'amŤne.
Et pour le truc ŗ Jessup ?
Oui. T'es sur la liste.
Vas-y quand tu veux.
Aucun souci. C'est ce mec-lŗ.
C'est le moment
de mťriter votre paye, les gars.
Marrante, ton intro.
- Comment Áa ?
- Pencher comme un camť et tout.
Pourquoi tu n'as pas continuť ?
Tu sais, tu entends souvent
des trucs marrants, lŗ-dedans.
Les gens rigolant de leurs erreurs,
faisant marrer tout le monde,
mais entre toutes ces blagues,
il y a beaucoup de vťritťs ŗ exprimer.
Comme la fille.
Elle a failli saigner, hein ?
Pendant une seconde, j'ai cru
que tu arriverais ŗ parler de Sherrod.
"Une ťvaluation morale rigoureuse
et courageuse." C'est Áa, l'ťtape.
M'en parle pas.
Je vis avec chaque putain de jour.
Faut que tu en parles pour avancer.
Je suis ton parrain.
- Je te dis de te sortir Áa de la tÍte.
- J'ai jamais manquť une rťunion.
Je ne te parle pas de Áa.
Je parle du chemin que tu prends aprŤs.
Je te parle de tes actions,
de tes pensťes, de ce que tu ressens.
Je ressens rien.
«a a jamais ťtť ton problŤme.
MÍme en tant que camť, Áa a jamais ťtť
le problŤme.
«a serait bien dommage
d'en faire un maintenant.
Carcetti nous a donc lancť un os. Plus
de limite pour les emplois d'appoint.
Oui. MÍme moi, je devrais
aller chercher un travail dťcent.
Y a plus d'argent ŗ se faire
dans la police.
Ils ont ťtť assez clairs.
T'es bon ŗ quoi faire ?
Mis ŗ part Áa.
J'ai un piston pour du 20 h - 4 h
ŗ la bijouterie de Friedman,
ŗ Reisterstown.
Oui. 20 de l'heure.
Se tenir
prŤs de bijoux et Ítre payť.
EnquÍter et mourir de faim.
Quel bordel, sťrieux.
- Du nouveau de la nuit ou de ce matin ?
- Oui, de la patrouille de nuit.
- Rťsolue ?
- Toujours ouverte.
Agression dans un bar de Curtis Bay.
Fahlteich est ŗ la morgue.
Nuit calme.
Je suis sŻr que Áa va bientŰt reprendre,
maintenant que personne
ne surveille Marlo Stanfield.
La suspension de l'enquÍte
ne vient pas de moi, Jimmy.
«a vient de chez vous.
Mais personne au cabinet du procureur
ne s'y est opposť.
Comme quand les accusations
pour port d'arme contre Chris et Snoop
avaient ťtť ajournťes 2 fois.
Un ajournement ou deux,
c'est <i>pro forma</i>
sur Calvert Street. Tu le sais.
"<i>Pro forma</i>", venant du latin,
voulant dire que les avocats
se branlent entre eux.
Les rŤgles sont les rŤgles.
Y a pas de putains de rŤgles.
Ce putain de jeu est truquť.
Messieurs.
Qu'est-ce que t'as,
ŗ t'en prendre ŗ Ronnie ?
C'est pas elle, le problŤme.
Marre d'Ítre pris pour un con.
Je vais me prendre un boulot d'appoint
dans ce magasin de cigares
sur Baltimore Street.
- Faire quoi ?
- Criminelle.
L'Indien du devant ?
Je te scalperais bien la tronche,
enculť.
C'est bon.
Qui s'en charge ?
Et voilŗ,
tu t'intťresses ŗ un truc
quand c'est pas ton tour.
C'est une petite couineuse, aujourd'hui.
Je m'inquiŤte pour lui.
Des bonnes nouvelles pour changer :
les notes des 8-9 ans
ont augmentť de 15 points.
- Seulement Áa, avec 54 millions ?
- Tu peux jouer lŗ-dessus.
15 points, c'est une belle augmentation.
Peu importe les augmentations,
faut que je m'en serve.
Je peux pas faire campagne
sur la criminalitť.
Burrell a dit qu'on aurait pas
la baisse de 2 chiffres.
Certainement une lťgŤre baisse.
Tant qu'on a pas repris l'…tat,
cette ville mourra de faim.
Je vais ŗ Annapolis,
peu importe qui restera comme maire,
Bond, Campbell ou autre...
- ils s'en sortiront mieux.
- Ce sera pas Nerese
si elle continue comme Áa.
Le <i>Sun</i> l'a mise ŗ mal.
Elle m'a dit que cet ťchange immobilier
datait de l'administration prťcťdente.
Probablement vrai,
mais elle s'est aussi fait payer.
«a te coŻtera certainement des voix.
Ils ne voteront pas pour toi si Nerese
doit finir ton mandat de maire.
Elle t'affaiblit.
Qu'est-ce qui rend
le gouverneur vulnťrable ?
Il avait l'air d'un irascible
aprŤs cette attaque contre Olesker.
- Il avait l'air parano, aussi.
- Et son ťchec sur les machines ?
Face ŗ l'assemblťe de dťmocrates,
on sait que le gouverneur endurera.
Et puis, les ťlecteurs sont partagťs
sur la lťgalisation des machines ŗ sous.
Il faut l'atteindre directement.
Je verrai ce qu'ont ŗ dire les gens
de Prince George's County, ce soir.
Je dÓne avec Staney Miller et Maloney
ŗ Upper Marlboro. Ce qui me rappelle...
En retard pour Jen'.
«a ne vous semble pas un peu lťger,
de convoiter le poste de gouverneur
deux ans aprŤs l'ťlection de maire ?
Tout est lťger.
Le monde entier ťclaire de la merde
et y voit de l'or.
Somerville revient sans cesse trouver
Tommy pour les derniŤres nouvelles.
Son rťdac' chef veut
qu'il lui pose toutes les questions.
Et Somerville,
frappant ŗ la porte du grand Tommy,
bl‚mant le bureau local,
il dit : "Je suis dťsolť, M. le Maire,
mais mon bureau aimerait savoir."
- Je la vois venir.
- 3 ou 4 fois, vous voyez ?
"Mon bureau se demande...
Je suis dťsolť, M. le Maire,
"mais mon bureau aimerait savoir."
Finalement,
Tommy d'Alessandro, il met son oreille
contre son bureau et dit :
"Mon bureau dit au vŰtre
d'aller se faire foutre."
- «a s'est rťellement passť ?
- Elle est trop bonne pour vťrifier.

Une histoire poignante du cŰtť Est.
Une mŤre trŤs respectťe de 4 enfants
est dťcťdťe suite ŗ une rťaction
allergique aux crabes bleus.
Elle les a tous mangťs,
mais est tombťe de face sur l'assiette.
Dťclarťe morte 1 h plus tard ŗ Hopkins.
Une soeur organise une collecte
pour les ťtudes des petits.
- Interview de la famille, photos, tout.
- Bien jouť.
…toffe-le avec quelques trucs mťdicaux
sur la toxicitť des produits de mer.
Augmentation des cas, tous ces trucs.
OK, Áa marche.
Les mŤres de 4 enfants
ont toujours la poisse.
Meurtre, dťlit de fuite,
feu de pavillon,
- trompťes par des bigames.
- Dur d'Ítre une mŤre de 4 enfants.
 tre le spectateur innocent, c'est pire.
C'est toujours lui qui en p‚tit.
Ils se font rares.
Plus beaucoup d'innocence ťgalement.
Encore plus rare :
des blondes sculpturales.
On en voit plus aucune
dans les journaux, de nos jours.
Celles ŗ forte poitrine non plus.
C'est une espŤce ťteinte.
T'as quoi, maintenant ?
Rťunion d'ťtude sur les ťcoles.
M. Whiting prťpare son Pulitzer.
J'aurai tout vu.
Tu aurais pu prendre le taxi.
Seulement si c'ťtait sŻr
que ces enculťs me remboursent.
Donc, mÍme la Crim
ne rťpare plus ses voitures.
On est rťduits ŗ deux unitťs.
Une ŗ la morgue avec Fahlteich,
l'autre sur un nouvel appel.
Quelle blague.
Femme de 67 ans, 4 enfants,
plusieurs petits-enfants,
vivait seule.
Pas vue depuis 2 jours,
donc le voisin a appelť.
Pas d'entrťe forcťe.
- Premier sur les lieux ?
- J'ai enfoncť la porte arriŤre.
- Tu as contactť le labo ?
- On est sur la liste.
D'aujourd'hui ?
Putain de labo aussi, hein ?
Ils ťconomisent
jusqu'ŗ la moelle des os.
Elle doit Ítre lŗ depuis deux jours.
S'il faisait plus chaud,
elle aurait ballonnť.
«a doit Ítre naturel.
Mais j'ai pas aimť le fait
qu'elle ait un oreiller sur le visage.
Je parie qu'elle est morte
dans son sommeil.
Tu t'es jamais rťveillť
l'oreiller sur la tÍte ?
Les matins de gueule de bois,
je mets parfois l'oreiller sur le visage
pour me cacher de la lumiŤre
et diminuer la douleur.
Moi, je me contente de dťgueuler
et je vais au boulot.
FaÁon district Ouest.
Le mot auquel je pense
est "dickensien".
Illustrer les vies dickensiennes
des enfants dťfavorisťs,
et montrer de maniŤre claire et concise
oý le systŤme scolaire les dťlaisse.
Je ne dťfends pas les ťcoles,
mais ces gosses sont dťlaissťs ailleurs.
Ils sont exclus
bien avant d'entrer en cours.
Pour les apprťhender,
il faut voir le manque d'ťducation.
Le milieu de la drogue,
l'ťconomie de ces quartiers.
Mais on peut aborder les ťcoles.
Oui, on peut les flageller.
Dieu sait qu'elles le mťritent
de temps en temps,
mais alors, on ne vaudra pas mieux
pour eux que ces ťcoles.
C'est comme Ítre sur le coin d'un toit
ŗ montrer aux gens comment
des bardeaux se sont dťtachťs,
tandis qu'un ouragan
bousille le reste de la baraque.
Pas besoin de beaucoup de contexte
pour ťtudier une classe.
Vraiment ?
Selon moi, il en faut beaucoup
- pour ťtudier quoi que ce soit.
- Non.
Je pense que Scott
est sur la bonne voie.
Limiter le champ
et ne pas s'enliser dans les dťtails.
Pour mettre en avant le problŤme
ou gagner un prix ? Quel est notre but ?
…coutez, Gus, je connais les problŤmes.
Ma femme est bťnťvole
dans une ťcole de dťfavorisťs.
Mais ce que je veux, c'est du concret,
oý le problŤme et sa solution
peuvent Ítre mesurťs avec clartť.
Y a plus d'obstacles ŗ l'apprentissage
qu'un manque de matťriel
ou une administration inefficace.
Mais qui va lire Áa ?
Comment pourrait-on
rťsumer en une phrase ?
"Johnny sait pas ťcrire
car Johnny a jamais de crayon."
Augustus, je ne suis pas aussi naÔf
que vous pouvez le penser.
Vous voulez un projet pťdagogique
ou une litanie de prťtextes ?
Je ne veux pas d'articles amorphes
dťtaillant les maux de la sociťtť.
Si vous y mettez tout,
il ne restera plus rien.
C'est le moment d'explorer les ťcoles,
et Scott sera parfait
pour s'en occuper.
Tu m'agaces sťrieusement.
Rentre dans cette maison
avant que je te botte tes fesses.
Rentre ici, idiot. Allez.
Treena.
Treena. Attends-moi. Je reviens.
- Reste lŗ. Ne bouge pas.
- AmŤne-toi, fille.
Wooton, tu as mis les chiffres
de l'article sur le port ?
Merde, j'ai oubliť.
- Donne-les-moi. Je les mettrai.
- Moins 12 points pour les cargaisons,
mais le roulage
a augmentť de 6,4 % l'annťe derniŤre.
D'accord. Baisse de 12
et roro monte de 6,4. Merci.
Le patron ŗ 6 h.
- Whiting ?
- Pire. Klebanow.
Augustus. Qui s'occupe
de la journťe inaugurale demain ?
Pas le match, mais l'article.
Luxenberg voulait envoyer McGuire.
Je pense que Scott
ferait du trŤs bon travail.
J'aimerais bien trouver un vieux
supporter, qui prťfťrerait mourir
que de louper le match d'ouverture.
Quelqu'un qui vit pour le baseball.
C'est vous, le chef.
Scott, mettez-y votre petite touche,
comme pour l'article sur les Preakness
l'an dernier.
- Bonne chance.
- Merci.
Merde.
- Qu'y a-t-il ?
- Dťsolť. Rendors-toi, bťbť.
- <i>Service mťtro.</i>
- Spry, c'est moi.
Quelqu'un au secrťtariat de rťdac' ?
<i>Oui. Tu veux faire un changement ?</i>
Oui, je veux vťrifier le sujet du port.
J'ai dŻ inverser des nombres.
Andy, je peux avoir le sujet du port ?
Bien sŻr.
On a du temps. Vas-y.
Quelque part dans le corps de l'article,
un paragraphe
sur la tendance des cargaisons.
<i>Roro, cargos.</i>
- Lis-le-moi.
- <i>Cargos en baisse de 12 %,</i>
<i>roro en hausse de 6,4.</i>
Diminution de 12 points
et augmentation de 6,4 pour le roro ?
<i>C'est bien Áa.</i>
Merde.
Je me suis rťveillť en sueur
pensant avoir merdť. T'es sŻr ?
Cette nuit, tu as eu
l'habituel cauchemar du bouclage
sans vťritable raison.
Tu dois Ítre meilleur
que tu ne le penses.
Faut croire.
Merci, Jay.
<i>ņ ton service. Bonne nuit.</i>
Combien de temps pour ma vieille ?
Y en a pour un moment.
- Je suis surchargť.
- Je vais prendre le petit-dťj.
Il n'y a qu'une seule solution.
ArrÍtez. Conneries. C'est pas
un meurtre. C'est une overdose.
On a trouvť sa trousse
dans la salle de bain, et sa copine
dit qu'ils se shootaient.
MÍme s'il y a des traces d'hťroÔne,
Áa serait une cause secondaire.
Il a des pťtťchies,
des contusions sur le cou.
C'est un meurtre
par asphyxie mťcanique.
OK. Je vous amŤne le paramťdical,
et il vous expliquera lui-mÍme.
Exactement. Je vais aller ŗ Dundalk
et le traÓner ici vous parler,
car je refuse de prendre Áa
comme un meurtre.
Nancy. «a roule ?
J'ai appris que t'es retournť ŗ la Crim.
Comment Áa va dans le comtť ?
De pire en pire.
Vous gardez pas la merde chez vous.
Qu'est-ce qui ťnerve Kevin ?
La nouvelle s'obstine ŗ dire
que c'est un meurtre.
C'est pas le cas,
mais je vois pourquoi elle le pense.
Il a l'os hyoÔde fracturť
et des pťtťchies dans les yeux.
C'est ťtonnant.
Si on n'avait pas ťtť lŗ,
j'y aurais jamais cru.
C'est post-mortem.
Il s'enfile un pot belge et s'ťvanouit.
Il tombe entre les w.c. et la baignoire,
et se coince bien.
Je pourrais pas inventer Áa.
Les paramťdicaux
le dťclarent mort immťdiatement.
Mais ťcoute un peu Áa.
Ils ne peuvent pas le sortir
sans le lever par son cou.
On les a vus faire, ce paramťdical
de Dundalk et le mec de la morgue.
Ils ont agrippť son cou
et tirť d'un coup sec.
Puis il arrive ici
comme s'il avait subi un ťtranglement.
Ils peuvent pas dire
que c'est post-mortem ?
Sur un cadavre rťcent, impossible.
Saisir quelqu'un trop fort
provoque des pťtťchies, brise l'hyoÔde,
laisse mÍme des contusions.
- AprŤs la mort.
- Putain.
Infante va pťter un c‚ble
s'il ne persuade pas
que ce n'est pas un meurtre.
Soit Áa ou accuser le paramťdical.
Tu vas prendre le petit-dťj en face ?
- Tu m'achŤtes un scrapple, matelot ?
- Viens.
Numťro 2.
Surprise.
Mon pote Sergei
s'est dit
qu'on devrait d'abord se parler.
Parler de quoi ?
ņ toi de me le dire, p'tit. Pour
conclure des affaires avec le Russe,
tu dois d'abord passer par moi.
Parce que dans cette taule,
dis-toi que je suis de ceux...
qui font autoritť.
Tout le monde doit me demander
mon aide ou mon avis
pour tout un tas de trucs.
Sergei est venu me dire l'autre jour
que ce renoi,
Marlo, qu'il connaÓt mÍme pas,
lui a envoyť du fric
pour Ítre sur sa liste de visiteurs.
Il me demande si je connais Marlo.
Je lui rťponds : "Bien sŻr.
Je le connais super bien." Tu vois ?
Dans les quartiers Ouest,
tout le monde se connaÓt, pas vrai ?
Je t'aide ŗ retrouver ta langue.
Tu veux approcher le Russe
pour te connecter ŗ ses potes.
C'est ces enculťs de Grecs que tu vises,
parce que, si tu y accŤdes,
tu pourras virer Proposition Joe
et toutes ces putes de l'Est
de l'assos.
T'es un homme d'affaires nť, hein ?
Mais le truc, tu vois,
je trouve que t'as raison et tout.
Les gars de l'Ouest
doivent se serrer les coudes.
Et les embrouilles
oý tu t'en es pris ŗ moi...
le passť est le passť,
mais nique toutes ces putes
des quartiers Est.
C'est comme Áa que je vois les choses.
Il n'y a que de l'amour dans mon coeur
pour ceux de l'Ouest, que de l'amour.
Bien sŻr, bon, tu vois,
j'ai droit ŗ ma part, moi aussi.
J'avais devinť.
Alors, envoie 100 plaques ŗ ma soeur,
et la prochaine fois
que tu viens ŗ Jessup,
ce sera pas ma tronche que t'auras.
Tu as ma parole.
100 plaques, hein ?
Et sinon,
comment Áa va, toi, ŗ part Áa ?
Le biz reste le biz.
Toujours.
- Je te cherchais, Jimmy.
- Salut. Quoi de neuf ?
Tu connais Nancy Porter, du comtť ?
- Lester Freamon.
- Enchantťe.
Merci pour le petit-dťjeuner.
Je te retrouve au sous-sol.
J'ai surveillť ce terrain
sur McCulloh Street toute la nuit.
- Ils y sont retournťs ?
- Deux fois.
Une fois en dťbut de soirťe
et une autre aprŤs 3 heures.
Ils se laissent aller,
surtout maintenant qu'ils croient
qu'on s'est retirťs.
Tu sais, quelques bons micros,
deux petites camťras de surveillance,
quelques heures de boulot,
deux semaines,
trois tout au plus,
c'est tout ce qu'il faut
pour cette putain d'affaire.
Daniels ne peut pas nous l'offrir.
Il a ťtť on ne peut plus clair.
Alors, on va voir ailleurs.
<i>Dans la zone droite,
le numťro 21, Nick Markakis.</i>
Vous allez au match ? Supporter
de la premiŤre heure des Orioles ?
Je me fous du match d'ouverture.
Entre Bud Selig et Barry Bonds,
ils ont ruinť le baseball, pour moi.
- Vous avez une minute ?
- Je suis en retard.
Comment s'impliquer quand
le commissaire justifie un lock-out
et annule la Sťrie mondiale ?
- Famille supportrice des Orioles ?
- En fait, je suis pour les Cubs,
mais mon fils les aime bien, alors...
Puis les stťroÔdes,
qui ont dťtruit ce qui restait
de crťdibilitť au baseball.
Il est irrťcupťrable.
Alors, vous supportez les Orioles ?
Vous Ítes contente que ce soit
le match d'ouverture au moins ?
J'emmerde le baseball !

Salut, Bubs. Comment Áa va ?
Va t'asseoir tout ŗ fait au fond.
Merci bien.
ArrÍte de pleurer. Ne pique pas
dans mon assiette. Maman va
t'en coller une.
Vous avez besoin d'aide ?
Parce qu'on ne fait pas Áa ici.
Dans notre foyer, personne ne frappe,
surtout pas les enfants.
Vous m'avez comprise ?
Dťsolť du retard.
La circulation est cauchemardesque.
Vous vous croyez drŰles ?
Vous croyez que je peux pas...
C'est bon, j'ai bien compris,
trous ŗ baise.
Allez vous faire mettre.
Encore quelques annťes
et tu seras bon pour patrouiller.
Pourquoi vous passez pas
ŗ mon bureau, en adultes ?
Il faut toujours s'enregistrer
pour entrer ŗ Woodlawn ?
Vous avez fait chier qui cette fois ?
On bosse encore en sous-marin
sur une affaire que les chefs ont clos.
- Il s'agit de quoi ?
- Les corps dans les maisons scellťes.
Ils ont refermť celle-lŗ ?
Nom de Dieu.
22 meurtres, Áa suffit pas ?
Plus de nos jours.
Vous avez bossť dessus plus d'un an.
Vous en ťtiez oý ?
Trop prŤs du but pour abandonner.
Tu connais Marlo Stanfield,
Chris Partlow, Snoop Pearson ?
J'ai dťjŗ entendu ces noms.
Les analyses n'ont rien donnť.
Aucun tťmoin,
rien pour une accusation pour meurtre.
On s'est donc installťs,
on les a observťs pendant un an.
- Vous avez un schťma ?
- Un trŤs bon.
2 ou 3 semaines avec camťras et micros
du FBI, une demi-douzaine d'agents...
Comme on vous l'a dit
quand l'affaire a dťmarrť,
on bosse plus trop
sur la drogue des ghettos.
On est sur des trucs terroristes
ou politiques.
On a dťjŗ fait tout le travail de fond.
2 ou 3 semaines, et vous faites la une.
Les fťdťs de mes deux, vous adorez Áa.
Je vais lancer l'idťe.
Je vais m'en aller.
Si vous Ítes d'accord, trous ŗ succion.
J'ai des trucs intťressants.
Attends. Dis-moi
que je le mette dans les rťsumťs.
J'ai un gosse en fauteuil roulant ŗ cŰtť
du stade voulant aller voir le match
mais ne pouvant pas
se payer un billet au noir.
«a l'air plutŰt bien. Tu as une photo ?
Ils ťtaient trop occupťs avec le match.
C'est ton sujet principal.
Il te faut une photo du gosse
si c'est ton accroche.
- On peut les envoyer maintenant ?
- Il a dŻ partir, mais tu peux essayer.
Merde.
- Quel ‚ge ?
- 13 ans.
Et ses parents ?
Il ťtait pas ŗ l'ťcole ?
- Dans cette ville ? Il a sťchť.
- Et ses parents ?
Morts. Sans dťconner.
Il vit avec sa tante ŗ Baltimore Ouest.
En fauteuil ?
Une histoire de balle perdue.
Tout ťtait plutŰt vague.
- Tu sais quand c'est arrivť ?
- Il voulait pas trop me parler.
En fait, il m'a donnť que son surnom.
Je dois commencer ŗ ťcrire
si tu la veux pour la 2e ťdition.
…cris chez Mťtro que je puisse
lire par-dessus ton ťpaule.
C'ťtait quoi, son surnom ?
E.J.
Jane, approche une minute.
Vťrifie les coupures depuis 3 ans.
Vois si on a un truc sur un gosse
blessť par une balle perdue.
Il aurait 13 ans maintenant.
Surnom : E.J.
Peut-Ítre ses initiales.
- C'est qui ?
- L'accroche
de l'ouverture. Si on le retrouve,
j'aimerais avoir une photo.
N'espŤre pas trop.
C'est une sacrťe affaire, vraiment.
Et Dieu sait qu'ils ont besoin d'aide.
- Pardon pour le retard.
- Du nouveau ?
Comme d'hab. «a va ?
En s'y prenant bien,
ce sera comme une spirale.
On commence ŗ l'extťrieur du cercle,
puis on gravite autour des bords,
collectant tout ce qu'on peut,
avant d'arriver ŗ Clay
et ŗ ceux qui lui sont proches.
Clay sait que l'accusation arrive ?
Clay Davis s'est attendu au pire
toute sa vie.
Il sait.
Et c'est tes hommes que j'ai au cul.
Pas des fťdťs,
pas des hommes de l'…tat, d'Annapolis.
C'est des enculťs de ma propre ville !
J'ai les mains liťes, Clayton.
Nouveau maire,
un nouveau procureur de l'…tat.
Je fais le travail du Seigneur
pour toi, Erv. Tu le sais.
Qui a obtenu cette augmentation
par la commission ?
Assez pour que tu finances
ton nouveau patio,
mais pas assez pour que ce type
de Pittsburgh prenne ta place.
Si seulement je pouvais.
Tu le sais, que j'aimerais pouvoir.
Mais avec Carcetti, des gens sont
ŗ l'affŻt. On me surveille maintenant.
Tu es quand mÍme le prťfet, non ?
Oui, mais c'est plus ce que c'ťtait.
- Si tu n'as aucun contrŰle, qui alors ?
- Pour Áa, je dois voir avec Daniels,
et c'est le chouchou de Carcetti.
Il s'agit lŗ d'une enquÍte
devant un grand jury, bon Dieu.
On pourrait Ítre accusťs
d'entrave ŗ la justice.
Bon sang, Erv. J'ai ťtť lŗ pour toi,
et tu me fais ce coup-lŗ ?
Clay, je ne peux rien.
Personne ne pourrait rien.
Tu crois que je vais tomber, hein ?
Tu crois que je suis foutu.
Bande de sales ingrats, vous croyez
pouvoir me jeter par-dessus bord.
- Clay.
- C'est bon !
Je n'oublierai pas ce moment, Erv.
Je vais le garder en mťmoire.
Clay vient se plaindre ŗ vous ?
Comme si je pouvais freiner ce merdier.
Est-ce que c'est...
Oui. Tout droit sorties
des …tudes & Rapports.
Et on a ťpurť au maximum.
Avec la mairie qui demande des stats
honnÍtes, notre action est limitťe.
On va dire quoi au maire ?
Je suis restť une demi-heure
avec lui et son adjoint.
Il sait ce qu'il refuse.
- Alors, comment...
- C'est personnel, Jimmy.
Quelqu'un ŗ la mairie
a ťnervť le procureur fťdťral.
- Tu dťconnes.
- Non, et j'ai reÁu un savon.
Dis ŗ Lester que j'essaie toujours
de trouver quel est le problŤme,
mais pour l'instant, n'espťrez pas
refiler votre affaire ailleurs.
DEA, ATF, Douanes...
Toutes les portes vous sont fermťes.
Le secrťtariat ŗ la faune
n'y pourrait rien.
Dťsolť, mon frŤre.
Le gosse est introuvable.
J'ai envoyť le service Photo
pour essayer de le dťnicher. Rien.
- SŻrement parti.
- Donc, on a un pauvre petit Noir
en fauteuil, sans billet.
Il se traÓne depuis Baltimore Ouest
jusqu'ŗ...
"jusqu'ŗ l'ombre de l'imposant stade
fait de briques : l'Oriole Park",
ťcoutant "les cris de la foule,
qui rendaient compte de la situation."
On va mettre sur le devant un jeune
de 13 ans avec pour seul nom E.J.,
qui donne pas son nom
car il a sťchť les cours,
il n'a pas de parents,
il vit avec sa tante.
Je ne dis pas que ce gosse n'est pas
tout ce que tu prťtends, mais merde,
en tant que rťdacteur en chef,
il m'en faut un peu plus.
Je rejette cette insinuation.
Je n'insinue rien. Je suis de ton cŰtť.
- Mais la norme pour nous doit Ítre...
- Scott.
Je viens de finir votre histoire. Bien.
Je la mets en une.
Vous avez trŤs bien rendu la disparitť
entre les deux mondes de cette ville.
Je ne changerais pas un mot.
Merci, mais pas sŻr que tout le monde
partage votre enthousiasme.
Jim, Áa ne vous chiffonne pas un peu
qu'on n'ait mÍme pas son nom ?
- Je pensais qu'on s'imposait un...
- Ce n'est pas une situation idťale,
mais le fait qu'il rechigne
ŗ donner son nom de famille
est clairement dŻ ŗ sa peur
qu'on apprenne qu'il a sťchť.
- «a vous pose problŤme ?
- Un petit peu, plutŰt, oui.
- Simplement, les normes qu'on...
- Je pense qu'on est en terre ferme.
Entendu.
Le chef a parlť.
Tu peux y aller. Merci, Scott.
La boutique du renoi Webster.
Tťma, j'approche,
vous, vous sortez et vous allumez.
Descendez qui vous pouvez.
On a qu'ŗ la jouer cŰte Ouest.
Quoi ?
On tire depuis la gova.
C'est comme Áa qu'ils font.
Descendre un enculť sans ralentir.
Comme <i>Boys n the Hood</i>.
«a tapait, vous vous rappelez ?
J'en ai mÍme pas touchť un.
Ce renoi va pas bien.
Nique ces renois de la cŰte Ouest.
Parce qu'ŗ B-mo,
on vise et bute un renoi, pigť ?
Il laisse une vingtaine de macchabs
dans toute la ville,
tout le monde s'en branle.
C'est ŗ cause de qui il a descendu.
Bien vrai.
T'es pťpŤre dans ce pays
si c'est des Noirs que tu tues.
De jeunes Noirs, surtout.
Homicides mineurs.
- Si Marlo tuait des Blanches.
- Des enfants blancs.
Des touristes.
Une touriste blanche ex-cheerleader
disparue ŗ Aruba.
Le problŤme, c'est qu'on est pas
ŗ Aruba, mon salaud.
Tu crois que si 300 Blancs ťtaient tuťs
dans cette ville chaque annťe,
ils n'enverraient pas
la 82e aťroportťe ?
ArrÍte, nťgro.
On doit pouvoir
leur faire ouvrir le robinet.
Allez, Jimmy. Tu es le plus malin ici.
Trouve-nous un truc
dans cette ville fauchťe.
Il est pas mariť, un truc comme Áa ?
Tu as rťvisť l'article sur l'ouverture ?
Whiting en personne
a donnť sa bťnťdiction
avant que je puisse le descendre.
«a t'a pas dťrangť qu'on ait pas
le nom entier du gosse ?
Si, Rebecca, Áa m'a dťrangť.
Me sors pas Áa. Whiting ne partageait
aucun de mes problŤmes.
Aucune photo du gosse ?
Aucune.
Depuis combien de temps on est lŗ ?
Plus d'une heure.
Pourquoi on reste lŗ, tu crois ?
Pour voir qui est dans la maison ou pas,
qui est dans la rue,
police et tout Áa.
Exact.
T'as pas intťrÍt ŗ arriver en dernier.
Tu me suis ?
C'est pour Áa
que je viens une heure avant.
Des fois, deux.
Je veux pas de piŤge
quand j'en tends un.
Car y a rien de bien cŰtť surprises
dans ce boulot.
Pourquoi on se fait June Bug, dťjŗ ?
ParaÓt qu'il a traitť Marlo de suceur.
Il a bavť des trucs comme aÁ.
"ParaÓt" ?
T'es pas sŻre ?
On dit qu'il l'a dit.
Peu importe qu'il l'ait dit ou pas.
Les gens croient qu'il l'a dit.
Peux pas laisser pisser.
Pourquoi ?
Je veux dire,
Marlo a pas sucť de bite, exact ?
Donc, si Marlo sait
qu'il a pas sucť de bite,
pourquoi il s'intťresse
ŗ ce qu'a dit June Bug ?
Ou ŗ ce qui se raconte ?
Pourquoi il doit y passer
juste car il a bavť ?
Car il a une putain de grande gueule,
voilŗ pourquoi.
Et tu devrais fermer la tienne, p'tit.
Voilŗ.
Avec tous les gardes qu'il a.
Tu vois ?
PrÍts ?
Occupe-toi de ce truc.
Fais-moi signe,
retrouve-moi devant.
Michael, passe par la ruelle.
Quelqu'un jarte par l'arriŤre,
tu le descends.
Putain de merde.
D'habitude, c'est Bunk qui vomit.
T'as pris de l'aspirine ?
Six.
Comment ťtait cette brunette ?
Elle a dŻ Ítre pas mal,
car il est jamais rentrť.
La mÍme chemise qu'hier, Jimmy.
Beadie te gronde ?
- Simple question.
- Messieurs.
Un mort ŗ l'arrivťe.
Central et Baltimore.
J'ai pris une affaire il y a 2 jours.
La vieille ? C'ťtait pas une affaire.
Mort naturelle.
J'ai la gueule de bois, Jay.
Tous les deux. ņ vous.
Maman !
Comment va, Boris ?
Tu sais qui je suis ?
Le riche oncle qui a mis tout cet argent
dans ton compte cantine.
Dans mon pays, j'ai ťtť en prison 4 ans.
Dans mon pays, Áa, c'est pas une prison.
C'est rien du tout.
J'ai pas besoin d'argent.
J'ai pas besoin de putain de compte.
J'ai pas besoin de toi.
Gangster.
Je te comprends.
Je comprends, mais Avon, lŗ-bas,
il pense que tu pourrais aider
ŗ transmettre un message aux Grecs,
ŗ Vondas.
Je veux dire,
vu que t'as pas besoin de mon fric,
Vondas pourrait Ítre content de l'avoir.
S'il veut pas me rencontrer,
il me rencontrera pas,
mais s'il veut bien,
c'est toi qui auras arrangť la chose.
Sonny Mays est en retard.
Tu peux le remplacer
comme intervenant ?
Il est temps de partager, Bubs.
Non, je prťfŤre pas.
Je me sens pas terrible aujourd'hui.
Je suis ton parrain, et je t'assure,
tu dois t'investir dans quelque chose.
Je me fiche dans quoi.
Que ce soit lŗ-dedans ou pas.
Mais on peut pas vťgťter pťpŤre
avec cette merde-lŗ.
Tu dois t'investir ŗ un moment.
Inspecteur, un commentaire ?
Une info sur les suspects ?
Peut-Ítre ŗ votre sortie, alors.
La porte de derriŤre ťtait ouverte.
On arrive pas ŗ dire
s'il est sorti par lŗ-bas.
Ils. ņ moins que le tueur
ne lui ait mis une balle dans la tÍte
pour faire bonne mesure aprŤs le fusil.
Et deux de nos camťras de rue
ont ťtť dťsactivťes.
- Fils arrachťs.
- Putain.
«a a bien cogitť
pour qu'un enculť puisse faire Áa.
Putain, comment...
Comment ?
Il a dŻ Ítre dans le placard tout
du long. Personne a entendu que dalle.
Appelez les services sociaux.
Tout de suite.
Des media dehors ?
Amenez un vťhicule derriŤre.
«a va ?
Je sais pas quoi faire pour aider.
J'essaie de trouver mon chemin.
Vu le monde, je pourrais t'aider
en distribuant les tickets.
C'est bien, Bubs.
Mais tu prťfťrerais pas plutŰt servir ?
Servir les repas.
Donner la nourriture aux gens ?
C'est pas ce qu'il y a de mieux ?
Nan, je peux pas. Non.
D'accord. Viens.
On a toujours besoin de bras.
Il est tombť.
La derniŤre bouteille de bibine
l'a probablement tuť.
Un autre ivrogne l'a trouvť.
Mort ŗ mon arrivťe.
- Tu as appelť le labo ?
- L'attente est
de 2 ŗ 3 heures.
«a empire avec les jours.
«a va ?
Va te prendre un cafť.
Fais ta paperasse,
retourne dans la rue. On gŤre.
On va les attendre, de toute faÁon.
- Vas-y.
- Merci.
Ne laisse pas ce type bouger.
J'ai oubliť un truc dans la voiture.
AmŤne le journal, tu veux ?
On va camper.
Un peu tŰt pour Áa, non ?
Tu fous quoi ?
Surveille la porte.
Merde.
ArrÍte, Jimmy.
Ressaisis-toi, putain.
Mais t'as perdu la tÍte, putain ?
Nom d'un chien.
Nom de Dieu, sale putain de malade.
Il y a un tueur en sťrie ŗ Baltimore.
Il s'en prend aux plus faibles
parmi nous.
Il faut l'arrÍter.
Je suis plus lŗ.
Je veux pas Ítre mÍlť ŗ Áa.

{\c&HFFFFFF&}Transcript : FRM
You know how that go, right?
Gave myself all these little rules
about what I wouldn't do.
Like, I told myself I'd do
a lot of shit to get high,
but I swore I wouldn't
never trick.
So after I'm trickin'...
I thought,
"well, this ain't so bad.
"I'll do this for a while 'cept
I'll make some more rules for myself.
"like I'm gonna use condoms,
"and I'm never gonna go
with more than one guy
at the same time," and,
let's just say there are certain things
I told myself I wouldn't never do.
You know what my disease
did to my rules, right?
Whatever it is you tell yourself
you won't do to get high,
you're pretty much making a list
of everything you will do as soon as
your inner addict tells you to.
I mean,
that bitch wants to kill me.
She does.
Even on my way here today,
she was telling me not to come.
She was tellin' me that I was all right
on the street, that it was all good.
I'm about done.
I want to thank you all
for letting me share.
Amen.
Thanks for sharing, Dee-Dee.
Always lift us.
We got finished a little early.
Anybody else feel like sharing?
How 'bout you, Bubs?
Haven't heard from you in a while.
Bubbles.
Get up there!
Come on, bubs.
All right, bubbles.
Hi, y'all.
- You know who I am.
- Hey, bubs.
- Bubs. Bubbles.
- What's up, Bubbles?
I'm a grateful addict.
Been clean 15
months thursday.
This is the
longest I been off.
I...
Hey, yo! Let's go!
I used to get so high, you know.
I mean,
I used to love to be high.
Y'all see me out there
on Monroe and Fayette
doin' the dope-fiend lean, right?
Be like this here.
I come out of it,
get a little more upright.
Come to realize people
treatin' me like a lamp post,
hangin' fliers on me an' shit.
Come winter, little kids hangin'
Christmas balls on me like a damn tree.
Summertime,
they'd walk me over that garden,
where the nine-oh-nine used to be.
Make me...
Make me a scarecrow.
Yeah.
I used to love to get high.
Got to the point...
You know, I'm not in the right place
to talk about this right now.
Keep comin' back, Bubs.
Thanks, bubs.
Thanks for sharing.
Is there anybodylse
with  a burning desire to share?
Marvin?
It's quiet up in here.
You got the,
Bank of America accounts?
That pile there.
So he claims to be raising money
for some basketball program
or day-care center...
And the money comes in,
and the money goes out.
But no hoops, no day care.
Ok, so say we get Clay Davis,
- and say he flips...
- Then he takes us up the ladder.
To who? I mean, if Clay
is stealing from his own nonprofits...
That's an easy case for us to  make
with all the paperwork we got here.
That's a straight-up theft,
maybe a tax charge or two,
but there's money
that all this paperwork only hints at,
money that doesn't show up
on a campaign finance report.
My guess is that Clay Davis
knows about that, too.
I don't know, man.
I like street work more.
You'd rather sit in a surveillance van
days on end
waiting to catch Tater
handing Pee Wee a vial?
This, detective,
is what you're telling me?
A case like this here,
where you show who gets paid
behind all the tragedy
and the fraud,
where you show how the money
routes itself,
how we're all, all of us vested,
all of us complicit?
Career case, huh?
Baby, I could die happy.
Still, man,
I wonder what Marlo
is up to right fucking now.
Celebrating.
Yeah, but they still taking pictures?
No.
I ain't feel nothing in a while
we took care that thing
over the eastside. They ain't on me.
Snoop, she been rolling around all week.
Nothing, no cars, no vans,
no helicopters.
Monk-- he checked after the re-up,
no problem.
We wore 'em down.
What about cameras?
Nothing since the camera
we took out the wall back at the place.
My overnight man, he been watchin',
he ain't seen nothing either.
'sides, I think we good as long as
we move it around like this.
Back to bidness, I say.
She ain't had no work in a few months.
She somewhat eager.
Goddamn right.
Too much fuckin'
talkin' around here lately, man.
Niggas need to shut the fuck up.
For real.
A-ight, first thing.
We go hard at webster Franklin's crew.
Gave 'em the chance
to get on our tit, passed.
Now we bang on his corners
a couple of times 'til he fold.
- Now you talkin'.
- Yeah.
Next, we step to June bug
for talkin' that shit.
He was a dead man
when he opened his mouth.
He just walkin' around
not knowing it.
You know, an' I
want that dicksucker.
Took my money
and the whole world know.
Naw. He got to fall.
Omar rolled out
in retirement and shit.
I'm hearin' somewheresSouth.
Bring his ass back
out of retirement.
- A-ight.
- Yeah, a-ight.
We can step that shit up,
but he's goin' to be comin'
at us like we comin' at him.
I mean, Joe and them,
they said let that be.
No crown ain't worth much
if the nigga wearin' it
always gettin' his shit took,
and Joe ought to know that.
Let him come. Yeah.
What up with that
thing down at Jessup?
Yeah, yeah. You on the list.
Go on down there anytime you want.
No problem.
That's the dude right there.
A-right.
Time for y'all
to earn your pay, niggas.
Funny how you started out.
- What you mean?
- Dope-fiend lean and all.
Why didn't you keep going?
You know, you hear a lot
of funny shit in these rooms,
people makin' fun of their mistakes,
makin' people laugh,
but in between all the jokes,
there's a lot of truth to be spoke.
Like that girl today.
She damn near bled out, didn't she?
You know, for a second there,
I thought you might actually stand up
and talk about Sherrod.
"a searching and
fearless moral inventory."
- That's the step.
- Don't tell me about that.
I live with that
every fuckin' day, man.
You got to let it out to let it go.
I'm your sponsor, and I'm telling you,
you got to get it out of your head,
- outside yourself.
- I never missed a meeting.
I'm not talking about the meetings.
I'm talking about where you go after.
I'm talking about what you do,
what you think,
what you feel.
I don't feel nothing.
That was never your problem.
Not even as a low-bottom
dope fiend, that
was never the problem.
It would be a fuckin' shame
to make it the problem now.
So Carcetti threw us a bone, huh?
Took the cap off
secondary employment.
Yeah. Even I may have
to go out and find honest work.
There's no money to be made
in this policing shit.
They made that clear enough.
What are you
qualified to do?
Aside from that, I mean.
You know I got an in
on the eight-to-four gig over
at Friedman's jewelry,
you know, off of Reisterstown.
Yeah, 20 an hour.
Stand around
with some shiny shit and get paid.
Work murders and starve.
Fuck kind of shit is that?
Anything from
overnight or this morning?
Yeah, midnight shift caught one.
Solved?
Open.
Bar cutting from Curtis bay.
Fahlteich's over at the morgue now.
Slow night.
Oh, I'm sure things
will be picking up
now we're no longer
sitting on Marlo Stanfield.
It wasn't my call to suspend
the investigation, Jimmy.
That decision came
from your shop.
Yeah, but nobody from the S.A.'s
office objected, did they?
Just like nobody objected
when Chris and Snoop got their gun
charges postponed
a couple of times.
A postponement or two is pro forma
on Calvert Street. You know that.
"Pro forma" from the Latin,
meaning the lawyers
jacking each other off.
Rules are the rules, Jimmy.
There are no fucking rules.
Fucking game's rigged.
Gentlemen.
Why the fuck chew
on ronnie's arm, huh?
She ain't the problem.
Tired of being jerked around.
I think I'm gonna get me
a secondary job
at that high-end cigar shop
on Baltimore street.
- As what?
- Homicide.
The Indian out front?
I'd like to scalp your ass,motherfucker.
Got it.
Who's up?
There you go,
givin' a fuck when it ain't your turn
to give a fuck.
He's a pissy
little bitch today.
I'm worried for the boy.
Some good news for a change
as the test scores
for third-graders going up
a good 15 points.
- That's what I get for 54 million?
- You can run on that.
15 points is a nice,
solid number.
Whatever bump in the test scores I get,
I got to run on it.
I sure as hell can't campaign
on the crime rate at this point.
Burrell already told us
we don't have a double-digit decline.
A small drop, most likely.
Until we take back
the statehouse,
this city will starve.
I get to Annapolis,
and whoever I leave behind as mayor,
Bond, Campbell, or who knows...
- They gonna have a better time of it.
- It's not gonna be Nerese
if she's goin' like she has.
<i>Sun</i> papers made her look bad.
Yeah.
She tells me this real estate flip
was a holdover
from the last administration.
True as far as it goes,
but she got herself paid as well.
She looked bad enough
that it'll cost you votes,
people who don't want
to make you governor
if that means
Nerese finishes your term as Mayor.
She makes you vulnerable.
What, can I ask,
makes the governor vulnerable?
He looked like a petulant little bitch
with that diatribe on olesker.
He looked paranoid, too.
What about his
failure on slots?
With a democratic assembly,
everyone expects a G.O.P.
Governor will take his lumps.
Besides, voters are split
on legalizing slots.
It has to hit him directly.
Well, I'll see what's on the mind
of the P.G. County boys tonight.
I got dinner with Stenny Miller,
and Maloney
down in upper Marlboro,
which reminds me...
You're late to meet jen.
Doesn't this seem a little thin to you,
running for governor
2 years into a 4-year term?
Everything's thin.
The whole world shines shit
and calls it gold.
So Somerville, he keeps going back
to ask Tommy the elder follow-ups?
One question after another
his editor wants him to ask him.
Somerville,
knocking on big Tommy's door,
blaming the city desk,
saying, "I'm sorry to bother you,
Mr.Mayor, but my desk wants to know."
- Shit, I see it coming.
- So 3 or 4 times, right?
"my desk is wondering--
I'm sorry to bother you,
Mr. Mayor, but my desk wants to know."
So finally,
Tommy d'Alesandro,
he puts his ear down to his desk
like this, and he says...
"my desk tells your desk
to go fuck itself."
That really happen?
Too good a story to check out.
What's my favorite G.A. reporter
have today for his favorite editor?
Heartbreaker from eastside.
Salt-of-the-earth single mother of 4
dies from allergic reaction
to blue crabs.
Ate them all her life but goes
face down in a lump backfin
pronounced an hour later at Hopkins,
and sister is starting
a scholarship fund for the kids.
Interviewed the whole family.
- Photos, the works.
-Attaboy.
Round it out with some,
some medical stuff
on seafood toxicity, huh?
Growing incidence,
all that good shit.
All right, cool.
You ever notice how mother
of 4 is always catching hell?
Murder, hit-and-run,
burn up in row house fire,
- swindled by bigamists.
- Tough gig, mother of 4.
Innocent bystander is worse.
He's always getting the short end.
Not a lot of them around anymore.
Not a lot of innocence either,
you ask me.
You know who there's less of?
Statuesque blondes.
You don't read about statuesque blondes
in the newspapers anymore.
Buxom ones, neither.
They're like a lost race.
What do you got next?
School project meeting.
Mr. Whiting builds his Pulitzer.
Now I've seen everything.
Why not call a cab at least?
If I thought these motherfuckers
would reimburse me, I would have.
So homicide can't
shop cars neither.
We're down to two working units.
One was at the morgue with Fahlteich,
the other was on fresh call.
Jesus.
What a joke.
67-year-old female, mother of 4,
grandmother to many,
lived alone.
Not seen in two days,
so the neighbor called.
No forced entry.
- You the first officer?
- Had to kick in the back door.
- You call for crime lab?
- We're on the list.
Today's list?
Fucking crime  lab, too, huh?
They've cut
everything to the bone.
Been here maybe
a couple of days.
If it was warmer, she'd have bloated.
Yeah, it's probably natural.
I just didn't like the way
she  looked laying there
with the pillow and all.
I bet she died in her sleep.
You ever wake up
with a pillow over your face?
There's mornings with a hangover
I hold the pillow over my face
just to keep the light out
and the pain down.
Me, I just throw up once or twice
and go to work.
Western district way.
The word I'm thinking
about is "dickensian."
We want to depict the
dickensian lives of city children
and then show clearly and concisely
where the school system has failed them.
Not to defend the school system, but
a lot of things have failed those kids.
They're marginalized
long before they walk into class.
You wanna look
at who these kids really are,
you gotta look at parenting,
or lack of it, in the city.
The drug culture,
the economics of these neighborhoods.
Yet the schools are
something that we can address.
Sure, we can beat up
on city schools.
Lord knows they deserve to be
beat on every once in a while,
but then we're just as irrelevant
to these kids as the schools are.
It's like you're up
on a corner of a roof
you're showing some people
how a couple of shingles came loose,
and meanwhile, a hurricane wrecked
the rest of the damn house.
you don't need a lot of context to
examine what goes on in one classroom.
- Really?
- I think you need a lot of context
- to seriously examine anything.
- No.
I think Scott is on the right track.
We need to limit the scope,
not get bogged down in details.
To do what? To dress the problem
or to win a prize?
I mean, what are we doing here?
Look, Gus,
I know the problems.
My wife volunteers at a city school,
but what I want to look at
is the tangible,
where the problem and solution
can be measured clearly.
There's more impediments to learning
than a lack of materials
or a dysfunctional bureaucracy.
But who's goingto read that?
What is this series about in a sentence?
What's the budget line?
Johnny can't write 'cause
Johnny have never a fucking pencil.
Augustus, I'm not as simple-minded
as you might think.
Now what do you want,
an educational project
or a litany of excuses?
I don't want some amorphous series
detailing society's ills.
If you leave everything in,
soon you've got nothin
I think the schools
are ripe for exploration,
and I think Scott might be the man
to lead the charge.
You ain't doin' nothin'
but aggravatin' me now.
Get up in this house before
I beat the black off your ass.
Get up in here, fool. Come on.
Treena.
Treena. Wait for me.
I'm gonna come back out.
- Stay right here. Don't move.
- Girl.
Wooton, you dump in the numbers
from the port story yet?
- Oh, shit. I forgot. You want--
- Give them to me. I'll put them in.
Overall, cargo is down by 12 points,
but roll-on, rll-off gained
6.4% last year.
A-ight. Drop 12, ro-ro's up 6.4.
- Thanks, got it.
- Boss man on your 6.
- Whiting?
- Worse. Klebanow.
Augustus.
Who's the lead for opening day tomorrow?
Not the game story but the color piece.
Luxenberg wanted to go with Mcguire.
I think Scott would do an excellent job
with the color piece.
You know, I'd really like
to find some chaw-chewing old-timer
who'd die rather than
miss the o's opener,
someone who says, "baseball," you know?
You're the boss.
Scott, put your special touch on it
like you did
with your preakness piece last year.
- Good luck to you.
- Thanks.
Fuck.
What's wrong?
Sorry.
Go back to sleep, baby.
- <i>Metro desk.</i>
- Hey, Spry, it's me.
Is the night man
still on the copy desk?
<i>Sure is.
You need to make a change?</i>
Yeah, I think I just want
to check on the port story.
I think I might have
transposed some numbers.
Andy, can I get port back?
Yeah, sure.
We got time on the final.
Go ahead.
Yeah. Somewhere down
in the a-matter,
a graph about the cargo trends
with percentages.
<i>Ro-ro, cargo.</i>
- Read that back to me.
- <i>Cargo down 12%,</i>
<i>ro-ro up 6.4.</i>
12-point decrease
and a 6.4 bump on the ro-ro?
<i>Yep, that's it.</i>
Shit.
I woke up in a sweat 'cause I thought I
fucked that up. You sure?
Tonight, you had the usual deadline
nightmare to no actual purpose.
I guess you're better at
this than you thought.
Yeah, I guess.
Thanks, Jay.
<i>Anytime. Good night.</i>
<i>The husband's thinking, "gosh." I mean,
the police show up at his door and say,</i>
"the lady you married from the Uraine,
<i>"A she's dead;
b, she's got a 2005 gold Mrcedes."</i>
How long 'til my old lady?
It's gonna be a while.
- Got my hands full.
- I'm across the street for breakfast.
At this point,
there's only one way to rule.
Come on. Bullshit.
This is not a murder. He overdosed.
Look, we found his gear
on the bathroom floor,
and his girlfriend, who called 911,
said  the two of them were firing.
I don't have the tox results yet
but even if they find heroin,
right now,
it'd be a secondary cause.
I've got petechials,
bruising around the neck.
My preliminary is homicide
by mechanical asphyxia.
Ok, fine. I'll fucking bring
the paramedic in here,
and he'll fucking explain
it to you himself.
That's right.
I'm going to go back to dundalk,
drag his ass in here
so you can hear it from him
'cause I ain't taking this as a murder.
Hey, Jimmy.
Nancy. How's tricks?
Heard you were working murders again.
How's life in the county?
Worse every year.
You guys can't keep all the
dirt on your side of the line.
What's Kevin so hot about?
New cutter's dug her heels in,
says it's a murder.
It's not, but I can see why
she'd think strangulation.
Guy's got a fractured hyoid,
petechia in both eyes,
but it's a freak thing.
If we weren't there to see it,
I wouldn't have believed it myself.
It's all post-mortem.
He fires up a speedball,
then blacks out,
falls between toilet and bathtub,
manages to get himself
wedged back pretty good.
I couldn't make this shit up.
Medics come, pronounce him
right then and there,
but get this-they can't pry the guy
out without grabbing hold
of his neck for leverage.
We watched them do it.
This dundalk medic and the morgue guy
just grab his neck and start yanking.
Finally they get him out, he comes
down here looking like a strangle job.
They can't tell that it's post-mort?
On a fresh body, no one can.
Grab a guy too hard,
and you can cause petechia,
break a hyoid,
even leave bruising,
- all after death.
- Fuck me.
So Infante's about to lose his mind
if he can't talk this thing
out of becoming a murder.
Either that or
charge the paramedic.
Hey. You goin'
across the street for breakfast?
- Buy me some scrapple, sailor?
- Come on.
Number two.
Surprise.
My man Sergei
thought we should talk first.
- Talk about what?
- That's on you, youngun.
Whatever business
you tryin' to do through the Russians,
you got to go through me first.
'cause up in this bitch here,
I'm what you might consider
an authority figure.
You know everybody got to
get my help or ask my advice,
like, on all kinds of shit.
Sergei step to me the other day
sayin' this nigga Marlo,
who he don't even know,
just be sending him cash money
to get on his visiting list.
So then he ask me if  I knew Marlo.
I tell him,
"hell, yeah, I know Marlo real well."
You know?
Over westside,
everybody know everybody, right?
Let me help you find your tongue.
You tryin' to get to the Russian
so you can get a line to his people.
You tryin' to get
to the Greek motherfuckers
because if you can
you want to cut Proposition Joe
and all them other east side bitches
out the connect.
I mean, you a natural
businessman, right?
But this is the thing, though,
and I mean,
I'm with you on all that
as far as it goes, you know?
Westside definitely need
to stick together, you know what I mean?
And all the fuss about you
comin' at me--
I say let bygones be bygones,
but fuck all them eastside bitches.
That's just the way
I feel about it.
I got nothin' but love in my heart
for westside niggas, nothin' but love.
'course, I mean, you know,
I got to have my taste, too.
Figured that.
So send my sister a hundred large,
and the next time
you come down to Jessup,
it won't be my grill talkin' at you.
My word on that.
A hundred large, huh?
So what's up, man, what's up
with you otherwise, you know?
Ah, the game is the game.
Always.
They do not.
- I'm looking for you, Jimmy.
- Hey, what's up?
You know Nancy Porter
from the county?
- Lester Freamon.
- Good to meet you.
Well, thanks for breakfast.
I'll see you downstairs.
I spent last night sitting
on that same Mcculloh street lot.
- They went back there?
- Twice.
Once in the early evening
and once again after three.
They're getting sloppy,
especially now they think
we've backed away.
You know, a few good bugs,
a couple of small surveillance cameras,
some man hours, 2 weeks,
3 the most.
That's all this
fucking case needs.
Daniels can't give us that.
He made that pretty fucking clear.
Then we go elsewhere.
<i>In right field,
number 21, Nick Markakis.</i>
Going to the game?
Long-time O's fan?
I could care less about
opening day at this point.
Between Bud Selig and Barry Bonds,
they've ruined baseball for me.
- You have a minute to talk?
- Late to meet somebody.
How can you commit to a sport
where the commissioner
justifies a labor lockout
and cancels the world series?
Ho you  been an O's fan?
Actually, I grew up with the cubs,
but my son, he kind of likes them so...
And then on steroids,
which has destroyed
what's left of baseball's credibility,
he's nowhere to be found.
So, you an Orioles fan?
Are you excited at least
that it's opening day, that's kind of...
Fuck, baseball!
Peanuts! Get your peanuts!
51, 52,
53.
Hey, Bubs, how you doin'? Have a seat
all the way around the other side.
Obliged.
Stop crying.
Don't grab stuff off my plate.
Mommy's going to whip you.
Do you need some help here?
Because we don't do that here.
In our house, there's no hitting anyone,
especially children.
Do you understand me?
Sorry I'm late.
Traffic's a nitmare.
Think you're funny, huh?
Think I still don't have--
All right,
I get the point, fuck holes.
Fuck you both, already.
A couple more years of this,
you'll be ready for a radio car.
Why can't you come out
to my office and do this like grownups?
They still make you sign in
at the front desk out Woodlawn?
Who'd you knuckleheads
piss on this time?
We're still working the edges
of something the bosses shut down.
- What are we talking about?
- The bodies in the vacants.
They shut that down?
Jesus Christ.
- What, 22 murders doesn't rate?
- Not anymore.
You were on it more than a year?
Where were you?
Too close to quit.
You know Marlo Stanfield,
Chris Partlow, Snoop Pearson?
Those names ring out.
We got nothing back from any lab work,
there's no witnesses, nothing to make
a murder prosecution, so we settled in,
sat on them for about a year.
- You got a pattern?
- A good one.
2 or 3 weeks with some good
F.B.I. cameras and wires,
maybe a half-dozen agents--
Like we told you boys
when the case broke,
we aren't much
into ghetto drug shit anymore.
Most of our guys are counterterror
and political stuff.
We already did all the long legwork.
2 or 3 weeks, and you guys come
out of this with a big headline.
You federal fucks like headlines.
l'll run it up the flagpole.
- I'm gonna drive away now.
- All right.
If it's ok with
you suckholes.
I got good stuff.
Hang on. Come here.
Tell me so I can put it on the budget.
I got a kid in a wheelchair outside
the stadium, wanting to go to the game
but unable because he didn't have
the money for a scalped ticket.
- Sounds pretty good.
- You got art?
I tried, but photo said
they were too booked with the game.
This is your main color piece.
You got to have a picture of the kid
if he's your lede.
- Can we send them out now?
- I guess.
He probably rolled out,
but you can try.
Shit.
- How old is this fella?
- 13.
What's with his parents?
Why wasn't he in school?
In this city?
He just cut.
- What about his parents?
- Both dead. No shit.
He lives with his aunt
in west Baltimore.
How' he get in the wheelchair?
Something about a stray gunshot.
It was all pretty vague.
You got a date when it happened?
He was a little hinky
with telling me much.
Fact is, he would only
let me go with his nickname.
Look. I got to start writing
if you want it for the e-dot.
Why don't you work in metro write
so I can read over your shoulder.
What he go by, the nickname?
E.J.
E.J.
Hey, jane, come here a minute.
Check clips for the last 3 years.
See if we got anything on a kid
in the city wounded by a stray bullet.
He'd be 13 now.
Nickname of E.J.
Could be his initials.
- Who is he to us?
- The lede of our opening day piece.
If we find him,
I'd love to get art on the kid.
Don't hold your breath.
It's a hell of
a case, really.
And God knows
they can use the help.
- Sorry I'm late.
- Anything up?
- Just the usual.
- You all right?
We do this right,
it is like a spiral.
We start on the outside of the circle,
and we work our way around the edges,
pick up everything we can
before we get to Clay
and the people he keeps close.
You think Clay knows
the indictment's coming?
Clay Davis has been waiting for
the other shoe to drop his whole life.
He knows.
And it's your people up in my shit.
Not no feds, not no state
people from Annapolis.
It's motherfuckers
from my own city.
My hands are tied here, Clayton.
It's a new Mayor,
a new state's attorney.
I'm out there doing the Lord's work
for you, Erv. You know it.
Who got that pay raise
through the council--
just enough for you
to get that new patio
but not enough for that guy
from Pittsburgh to take your place?
I wish I could.
You know I wish I could,
but with Carcetti in,
people are watching.
I got eyes on me now.
You the commissioner still, right?
Yeah,
but it ain't like it was.
If you don't control it, who does?
On this, I got to reach around Daniels,
and he's Carcetti's boy.
This is a grand jury
instigation for God's sake.
We could both be charged
with obstruction of justice.
Goddamn it, Erv. I been there for you,
carried water for you,
and you do me like this?
Clay, I can't.
Nobody could.
You think I'm goin' down, don't you?
You think I'm done.
All y'all ungrateful bitches
thinkin' you can throw me out the boat.
- Clay.
- A-ight!
I'm gonna remember this moment, Erv.
I'm gonna hold onto this moment.
Clay crying to you?
Like I can put
brakes on this mess.
Is that--
Yeah. Straight from p-and-r.
And that's with the numbers
bent as far as we dare.
With city hall asking for clean stats,
- there's only so much we can do.
- The hell are we gonna tell the Mayor?
I sat there for half an hour
with him and his deputy.
He knows what he's saying no to.
- Well, then how the fuck--
- It's personal, Jimmy.
Somebody at City Hall
really pissed off the U.S. Attorney.
- You're kidding me.
- No, and I got an earful.
You tell Lester that I'm still trying
to figure out what the problem is,
but for right now, you forget
about shopping this case anywhere.
D.E.A., A.T.F., customs--
you guys are shut out across the bord.
Fish and fucking wildlife
couldn't help you.
Sorry, brother.
The kid is
nowhere to be found.
I sent photo down there
to try and dig him up. Nothing.
Probably left.
So we got a poor black kid
in a wheelchair with no ticket.
He rolls himself from
somewhere in west Baltimore to--
To "the shadow of the mighty brick-faced
coliseum known as oriole park,"
listening to "the cheers from the crowd,
which told the whole tale."
We're gonna give good play
to a 13-year-old known only as E.J.,
who declines to give his name
because he skipped school,
he's got no parents,
he lives with his aunt.
I'm not saying that this kid isn't
everything you say he is, but damn,
as an editor, I need a little more
to go on if I'm gonna fly this thing.
I resent the implication.
I'm not implying anything.
I'm on your side.
But the standard for
us has to be--
Just finished your story.
Good read.
I'm putting it out front.
I think you've really captured
the disparity
of the two worlds in this city
in a highly readable narrative.
I wouldn't change a word.
Thanks, but I'm not sure
everyone shares your enthusiasm.
Aren't you just a little bit concerned
that we don't even
have a last name for this kid?
I thought we held ourselves up to a--
It's not an ideal situation, no,
but the boy's reluctance
to give his last name
clearly stems from his fear
of being  discovered as a truant.
- You have a problem with it?
- A little bit, kind of, yeah.
- I'm just saying that--
- I think we're on terra firma here.
Gotcha.
The man made the call.
You're good to go.
Thanks, Scott.
The nigga Webster's shop right there.
So look, I'm gonna roll up,
and y'all gonna pop out and pop off.
Drop who you can.
Let's go all west coast with this.
Say what?
Drive-by.
That's how they do.
Drop a motherfucker
and not slow down.
Like <i>Boys 'n' the Hood</i>.
Shit was tight, remember?
Man, I ain't even hit
near one of them.
This nigga's wound.
Fuck them west coast niggas
'cause in B-more,
we aim to hit a nigga, you heard.
Guy leaves two dozen bodies
scattered all over the city,
no one gives a fuck.
It's because who he dropped.
True that.
You can go a long way in this country
killing black folk.
Young males especially.
Misdemeanor homicides.
- If Marlo was killing white women.
- White children.
Tourists.
One white ex-cheerleader
tourist missing in Aruba.
Trouble is,
this ain't Aruba, bitch.
You think that if 300 white people
were killed in this city every year,
they wouldn't send the 82nd airborne?
Negro, please.
There's got to be someway
to make them turn on the faucet.
Come on, Jimmy.
You're the smartest boy in the room.
You come up with something
in this broke-ass city.
Isn't he married or some shit now?
Did you edit this opening day piece?
Whiting himself blessed it as written
before I could take a meat ax to it.
Did it bother you that we don't have
the boy's full name?
Yes, Rebecca, it did.
Don't give me that "huh."
Whiting wasn't buying
any problem I had.
No art of the kid?
None.
How long we been here?
More than a hour.
Why you think
we sitting here?
See who home and who not,
who on the block,
- police and whatnot.
- That's right.
You don't ever want to be
the last man to a party. You feel me?
That's why I show up to a job
an hour before.
Sometimes two.
I don't want nobody settin' up on me
while I'm settin' up on them.
'Cause there ain't no good thing
about motherfuckin' surprises
in this line of work.
Why we doin' June Bug anyway?
Heard he called
Marlo a dicksuck.
Talkin' shit like that.
You heard.
You ain't sure?
People say he said it.
Don't matter if he said it or not.
People think he said it.
Can't let that shit go.
Why not?
I mean,
Marlo ain't suck no dick, right?
So if Marlo knows he ain't suck dick,
then what the fuck he care
what June Bug say?
What anybody say?
Why this boy got to get dead,
just for talking shit?
'cause he got a big
motherfuckin' mouth, that's why,
and you need to stop runnin'
your own mouth, young 'un.
There it is.
And all the muscle he got.
See it?
You ready?
Now you handle that thing.
You give me a sign,
meet me out front.
Michael, you go 'round the alley.
Body come bustin' out the back,
you drop that shit.
Oh, shitfuck.
Bunk's usually the one throwing up.
You took aspirin?
6.
How was that brunette?
Must have been a decent ride
'cause he never went home.
Same shirt as yesterday, Jimmy.
You catchin' hell from Beadie?
No.
- Just asking.
- Gentlemen.
D.O.A. Central and Baltimore.
I took a call two days ago.
The old lady? That wasn't a call.
That came back natural.
Look. I'm hungover, Jay.
Both of you. You're up.
Mommy. Mommy!
'Sup, Boris?
You know who I am?
I'm that rich uncle been putting
all that money in your canteen account.
In my country, I was
in jail 4 years.
In my country,
this is not prison.
This is nothing.
I don't need money.
I don't need fucking canteen.
I don't need you.
- Gangbanger.
- A-ight. I feel that.
I feel that, but Avon over there,
he thinks you might be able
to help get a message to the Greeks,
to Vondas.
I mean, seeing as
you don't need my money,
Vondas might be happy to have it.
If he don't want see me, he won't,
but if he do,
it's you that made it happen.
Sonny Mays is running late.
Can you fill in as speaker?
It's time to share, Bubs.
Nah, I don't think so.
I'm not feeling so great today.
Look, as your sponsor,
I'm telling you,
you got to step up for something.
I don't care what.
I don't care
if it's in these rooms or not,
but there ain't no laying
in the cut on this shit.
You got to step up somewhere.
Detective, can I get a word?
Anything?
Anything on the suspects?
Maybe on your way out then.
Backdoor was open.
Can't tell if he ran through
and out the rear.
They. Unless the shooter
put a bullet in her head
for good measure
after the shotgun.
Also, two of our street
cameras were disabled.
- Wires ripped.
- Fuck.
That's a whole lot of thinking
for any motherfucker
to do something like this.
How the fuck?
How?
He must have been
in that closet the whole time.
no one heard shit.
Call D.S.S.
Now.
Any media out back?
Bring a cage car around.
Hey.
How you doing?
look, I don't know
what I can do to help.
I'm just tryin' to find my way.
seein' how crowded it is,
maybe I can help you hand out tickets.
That's fine, Bubs. Really,
but wouldn't you rather serve?
Serve lunch.
- You mean give the food to people?
- Isn't that the best part?
- Nah, I can't. No.
- All right. Come on.
We can always use
an extra set of hands.
He fell out.
Last bottle of smoke
probably did him in.
Another drunk found him,
pulled me off post.
Ten-seven when I arrived.
You call for a crime lab?
The wait's 2 to 3 hours.
Shit gets worse every day.
You ok?
Go get yourself a coffee,
Do your paperwork, get back
on the street. we got it from here.
We're gonna wait on them anyway.
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.
Don't let this guy go anywhere.
I forgot
something in the car.
Bring the paper in, will you?
We're gonna be here awhile.
Little early for that, ain't it?
What the fuck you doing?
Just watch the door, Bunk.
Shit.
Come on, Jimmy.
Get a fuckin' grip.
Have you lost
your fucking mind?
Oh, goddamn it.
Oh, Jesus Christ, you sick fuck.
There's a serial killer in Baltimore.
He preys on the weakest among us.
He needs to be caught.
I'm gone.
I don't want a part of this.

Tape moins fort, trouduc.
La relève est en avance.
Alors tirez-vous de là.
Bon Dieu, Bunk.
Quelle heure il est ?
4 h 30.
J'arrivais pas à dormir,
alors barrez-vous de là.
À quelle heure est parti McNulty hier ?
Il est pas parti. Il est dans la une.
Il s'arrache les cheveux sur un truc.
Réfléchis bien à ce que tu fous.
Bunk, ça peut marcher.
Ça peut marcher.
Va te faire foutre. Et je le pense.
4 h du mat' ?
Déjà.
Tout ça ?
Les meurtres de sans-abri depuis 5 ans.
Les affaires d'avant sont sur microfilm,
mais on a assez juste ici.
Presque toutes ouvertes. C'est pas
notre point fort, les meurtres de SDF.
Des lieux abandonnés,
ni proches, ni amis.
Tout le monde s'en fout.
Les dossiers vont rester ouverts.
Tu vas finir en taule pour ça.
Je te le dis.
Tu sais ce qu'ils font aux flics
en taule ?
Beau petit flic comme toi ?
Enculé de mes deux,
on a des gosses, des foyers,
les traites de la voiture,
des meubles. Jimmy.
Je viens d'acheter des chaises longues
et une table de jardin en verre.
T'achètes pas ces trucs-là
quand t'as prévu la prison.
- Tu tromperas pas le légiste.
- Tu paries ?
On ne peut résoudre ces meurtres.
Tu bousilles notre taux d'élucidation.
J'emmerde ces putains de chiffres.
Ces putains de chiffres
ont flingué le service.
Landsman et son taux
peuvent lécher le cul d'un singe.
Marlo vaut pas le coup.
Personne le vaut.
Marlo est un trou du cul.
Il peut pas gagner. Y a que nous.
Cette affaire ne disparaît pas
car les chefs n'ont plus l'argent.
C'est des putains de meurtres...
Dans le ghetto, mais quand même.
J'suis revenu de l'Ouest
pour bosser dessus
car on devait se donner les moyens.
Ils me l'ont promis,
et ils vont tenir cette promesse.
Qu'ils le savent ou pas.
Je vais prévenir Landsman.
Oui. Si tu continues comme ça,
je vais te balancer.
Fais ce que tu as à faire.
Mon nom reste
en dehors de ce dossier. Je veux
rien avoir affaire dans cette merde.

Tu fais quoi ?
La dernière édition est sortie.
Je veux voir mon article.
- Maintenant ?
- C'est ma 1re une. Je veux la voir.
On devrait se faire livrer à domicile.
Pourquoi payer quand je peux
l'avoir gratuit au bureau ?
Je reviens.
Frère Ray.
Repose en paix.
Quand arrive le <i>Sun</i> ?
Vers cette heure-là.
<i>Trois tués dans une effraction
de domicile à l'Ouest</i>
- Qui a une voiture qui roule ?
- Moi,
mais je retourne sur ma scène de crime.
Tu me déposes à la morgue ?
Dans mon bureau, tout de suite.
Je me ferai déposer
par une voiture de patrouille.
Ça dépasse toutes les conneries
que t'as faites dans ta vie.
- Réfléchis !
- T'as vu Greggs ?
À collecter les preuves seule,
à refouiller la scène d'un triple.
Un putain de triple meurtre.
Une effraction de domicile.
Et elle bosse toute seule.
Ils ont retiré Crutchfield ce matin,
il retourne en rotation.
- C'est de leur faute, mais...
- Un peu, oui ! Un triple meurtre !
Et 12 heures après, ils laissent
un seul inspecteur dessus ?
Au moins, avec une voiture !
- Ça marchera pas.
- Alors ça sera pas pire qu'avant.
- Un ou deux noms en rouge au tableau.
- Sauf si tu te fais choper.
Et qui va me choper
dans cette brigade ?
La plupart choperaient même pas
la chtouille dans un bordel mexicain.
C'est quoi, ce ruban rouge ?
Barlow a une affaire de strangulation
ouverte depuis quelques années.
Un sans-abri avec un ruban rouge
autour du poignet.
Ça en fait deux.
J'ai aussi
une affaire de sans-abri ouverte
par Ray Cole.
J'ai ajouté la mention d'un ruban
dans son rapport.
- Ce qui fait trois.
- Notre gars n'avait pas de ruban rouge.
- Je vais m'en occuper.
- Bon Dieu.
- Écoute-toi parler !
- Ils veulent pas
s'attaquer à un vrai tueur en série.
Ce putain de Marlo,
assis sur un tas de cadavres.
Ils ont besoin d'un imaginaire.
C'est plutôt toi qui as pété un câble.
Je suis enfermé dans la salle.
- <i>Dans la salle ?</i>
- Je rigole pas. Ouvre.
Il t'a baisé ?
Il a essayé.
Mais comme souvent,
il se baise lui-même.
Vous les découvrez, hein ?
Je l'aurais parié.
Le cul de ce putain de Burrell
doit être si serré
que t'en sortirais pas une épingle
avec un tracteur John Deere.
Vous promettez
une baisse à deux chiffres,
et lui, il vous refile
une hausse de 4 %
deux trimestres de suite.
Merci de m'apporter ça.
Je voulais vous tenir au courant.
En vérité, quand on voit
des chiffres pareils,
je me dis que vous pourriez
faire bien pire
que me promouvoir préfet suppléant.
Pas de façon permanente, je sais.
Peut-être six mois,
pendant que vous initiez
votre petit Daniels.
Je fais monter ma retraite,
et vous commencez à nettoyer
le bois mort, en commençant par Burrell
et Rawls.
Merci, Stan. Je vais y réfléchir.
Faites donc, Tommy.
Même en tant que suppléant,
tu peux imaginer
Nerese et les pasteurs dire oui
au préfet Valchek ?
- Que vas-tu faire pour les chiffres ?
- J'y peux rien.
J'ai réduit le budget de la police
jusqu'à la moelle. Je peux pas tellement
me plaindre
quand la criminalité augmente.
Si Burrell se présente ici
en avouant ces chiffres,
je devrai laisser couler.
Au moins le temps de le renflouer.
Ton papier a pris un coup dans l'aile.
De 6 feuillets à 2 feuillets ?
C'est de ma faute,
j'ai cédé face à la section A.
Le rédac' chef faisait tout un foin

Puis il le renvoie en pages Métro

sous le pli. Explique-moi ça.
Y a pas d'explication.
La pub marche moins bien,
on a moins de place pour l'info,
on la gère pas très bien.
On a merdé.
Voilà tout.
Mauvais code postal.
Ils sont morts
là où ça a pas d'importance.
S'ils avaient été blancs
et assassinés à Timonium,
ce serait 6 feuillets en une.
Ça aurait été ma première une
que je signais toute seule.
Je suis allée ce matin aux presses
de Port Covington pour un exemplaire.
T'es pas la première à faire ça.
Notre macchab est déjà sur la table ?
Il est à côté
de l'appareil photo sur pied.
Je dois prendre ses empreintes.
Tu veux pas attendre l'autopsie,
garder le corps intact ?
Je dois connaître l'identité
de ma victime. C'est la priorité.
Finis ton déjeuner, j'ai le temps.
Je vois rien sous les ongles.
On peut se risquer
à prendre les empreintes.
Y a un truc.
Rassemblez-vous, s'il vous plaît.
Steve, quelqu'un peut prévenir les gars
des faits divers et des sports ?
On veut tout le monde.
Quoi, on s'est encore fait racheter ?
Le <i>L.A. Times</i> nous a d'abord rachetés,
puis le <i>Tribune</i>. Le plus gros poisson...
- On est les sardines.
- Ou on a gagné un Pulitzer.
Les Pulitzer sont dans une semaine.
On est début avril.
Regarde le pantalon de Whiting.
Si on avait gagné un Pulitzer,
le directeur de la publication
serait tumescent.
Tum-quoi ? Parle français,
je suis que le chargé à la police.
Tumescent. Congestionné.
Tout à fait.
C'est un sale temps pour les journaux,
comme vous le savez tous.
La part des informations rétrécit,
alors que les revenus publicitaires
continuent de diminuer.
Les chiffres de distribution
sont également en baisse,
face à une diversité de media.
La technologie
ébranle la distribution.
Et l'Internet
est une source gratuite
d'informations et d'opinions.
À la recherche d'un équilibre
dans ce nouveau monde,
nous sommes face à des choix difficiles.
Notre premier bureau à l'étranger
a été ouvert à Londres en 1924.
La couverture internationale du <i>Sun</i>
a été une source de fierté depuis lors.
C'est donc avec...
d'immenses regrets
que je vous annonce
que Chicago a décidé
que les bureaux de Beijing,
Moscou, Jérusalem, Johannesburg
et de Londres
allaient être fermés.
Pour le reste,
dans la salle de rédaction,
il y aura une nouvelle série de rachats.
Chicago nous a donné
des cibles budgétaires
qui nécessiteront des choix difficiles
au sein de la rédaction.
Nous allons, en résumé,
devoir trouver des moyens
de faire plus avec moins.
Je vais donc passer la parole à Tom
qui va entrer dans les détails.
Vous devez avoir des questions,
mais laissez-moi d'abord m'exprimer.
Rassemble tes trucs,
temps de chercher une autre maison.
Chicago nous a envoyé une note
présentant les options que vous avez...
L'artère aorte devrait être élastique,
mais c'est du béton.
Celui qui l'a étranglé
aurait pu attendre un mois
ou deux.
Il était sur sa fin.
C'est comme ça. En plus de la fracture
de l'hyoïde et de la contusion,
j'avais des signes de bagarre
autour du corps.
Et des témoins
pensant avoir entendu une bagarre
à l'intérieur de la maison.
Et ce ruban que vous avez coupé...
- ça peut être lié à d'autres affaires.
- Le ruban
- que mon enquêteur a raté.
- Ça arrive.
Il était placé haut.
La cause du décès est un homicide
par strangulation.
Belle pioche, inspecteur.
"Quiconque désirant
de plus amples informations
"sur les indemnités
dans le cadre du plan COBRA
"concernant les départs volontaires
"peut prendre rendez-vous
avec les Ressources humaines."
Certains se verront attribuer
d'autres postes,
tandis que d'autres devront, bien sûr,
trouver d'autres opportunités
qu'au sein du <i>Sun</i>,
mais chacun dans cette salle
a fait un travail remarquable
et doit être fier de sa contribution.
- Combien de rachats y aura-t-il ?
- Pas encore décidé.
On voit le syndicat plus tard.
Quel impact sur les négociations
- à venir avec la guilde ?
- Mauvais.
Oublie toute augmentation.
Pourquoi des coupes budgétaires
alors que la boîte est rentable ?
Personne ne se sent plus mal que moi.
J'ai vu le travail remarquable
effectué sur Baltimore.
Plus tôt on vous rencontrera
individuellement,
plus tôt je répondrai à vos questions.
Pas O'Mara.
Bonne chance, tout le monde.
Stable sur les crimes et une hausse
de 1 % sur l'ensemble des délits.
Vous confirmez ces chiffres ?
- Pardon ?
- Stable,
même après les réductions imposées.
C'est ça ? Car la seule chose
que je vous demande,
la seule que je demande
par-dessus tout,
c'est des chiffres réels.
Oui, M. le Maire. Vous aviez été clair.
Très bien, alors.
Burrell est fini.
Il a creusé sa propre tombe.
On lâche les stats réelles,
et on garde les falsifiées
s'il se retire pas dans le calme.
On le remplacerait par qui ? Rawls ?
Il est entré avec les mêmes stats.
Connaissant Bill Rawls,
il appellera dès son arrivée au bureau,
disant avoir averti Burrell
pour les falsifications.
Les pasteurs ne voudront pas
de Rawls, Nerese non plus.
En tant que préfet suppléant,
ils accepteront, quelques mois,
si on a un candidat noir à leur vendre.
Daniels n'est pas prêt.
Il est colonel que depuis un an.
Un an fera l'affaire faute de mieux.
Lance l'idée à un de tes camarades
sur Calvert Street.
On verra le résultat.
Si Burrell lit ça,
il en chiera une pendule.
J'espère bien.
On est à Baltimore.
Personne vit éternellement.
{\a3}<i>Restaurant
& À emporter</i>
Andreas, c'est ça ?
Le Russe m'envoie.
Il faudrait passer un message à Vondas.
Il a un nouvel ami.
J'entends jamais ce nom.
Dites juste
que Marlo lui a laissé un cadeau.
Je reviens demain à la même heure.
Combien de temps ça peut durer ?
Je sais pas.
Toute la journée, peut-être.
J'ai des réunions prévues.
Nous devons poser les bases
minutieusement,
pour que les grands jurés
comprennent
et ne se perdent pas dans les détails.
M. Howard ?
Il est possible de passer plus tôt ?
Si vous avez assez d'importance.
Je suis le vice-président
d'une grande institution financière.
Qui ne l'est pas, putain ?
Je dirige votre attention
sur le document entre vos mains,
est-ce également un relevé de compte ?
En effet,
un compte rémunéré non lucratif,
d'organisation, statut 501c3.
Pouvez-vous clairement expliquer,
avec les termes les plus simples,
ces choses,
à commencer
par le terme "non lucratif" ?
Quelqu'un tue les SDF.
Le médecin légiste le confirme.
Y a un truc étrange
dans mon enquête, Bunk.
Le cadavre était un SDF,
mais il avait un ruban rouge
à son poignet.
De quoi pourrait avoir à se rappeler un
SDF pour avoir un ruban à son poignet ?
- Barlow.
- Quoi ?
Joli.
Comme si du Chanel Nº5
sortait de ton cul, Moreland.
Si tu as un problème, alors moi aussi.
C'est ainsi que marche la coop.
- Quel est le problème ?
- J'ai bien trop d'argent.
Fils, crois-moi,
y a pas que toi.
Que faire avec la merde
qu'on vend, c'est rien.
À Baltimore, la came et la coke
se vendent toutes seules.
Mais l'argent qui en ressort ?
Plus assez de matelas, hein ?
Des idées ?
Quelques-unes.
Si ça t'intéresse.
- Pas Twigg.
- Bon sang.
20 ans pour ce journal
et il finit comme ça ?
Le fait est que c'est plus rentable
de nos jours
de faire un mauvais journal
pour moins d'argent.
Réduction du personnel et des pages,
les recettes augmentent.
Si on est chanceux,
ils vireront que le bois mort.
Alors ?
"Travail remarquable."
Sans être explicites,
ils m'ont laissé le choix :
le secrétariat de rédac' ou le rachat.
- Tu rigoles ?
- Apparemment,
ils peuvent engager un jeunot et demi
pour ce que je leur coûte.
Bon sang, Roger.
- Désolé, vieux.
- Et puis merde.
Autant que je me mette à écrire
le grand roman américain.
<i>Gus, venez.</i>
Asseyez-vous.
Détendez-vous, Gus.
Nous avons besoin de vous, ici.
Nous apprécions votre dévouement.
Vous avez fait un travail remarquable.
On compte sur vous
pour le changement d'équipe.
Il y aura de remarquables talents
à développer ici.
Quel type d'équipe il restera ?
On perd des bons éléments,
mais on espère retenir
le noyau d'une équipe solide.
Faire plus avec moins.
C'est ce qu'on doit envisager
pour la suite.
Plus avec moins, hein ?
Regarde ça.
Un ruban rouge
dans un dossier de Ray Cole.
Il a laissé une note : "Trouvé
au poignet gauche de la victime.
"Comparer avec d'autres affaires."
Salut, trésor.
Les taches des meubles sont sèches ?
Génial.
J'arrive.
Le plus dur
est de soulever leur attention.
Buvons un coup. Je paye.
Tu crois que je vais te suivre ?
Rentre chez toi.
- Médite sur ta pauvre enquête.
- Rentrer ?
Pour l'amour de Dieu,
je bosse sur un tueur en série.
Tu veux en parler ?
J'étais avec Chris et les autres.
On a guetté cette famille.
Tout est si sérieux, maintenant.
Yo, bonhomme, t'as fait tes devoirs ?
Car il est tard
et il sera encore plus tard
si on traîne trop.
Pas école demain.
Réunion des profs.
On devrait faire quelque chose.
J'ai mon coin de rue.
Quoi ? Quoi, négro ?
Six Flags sera rouvert.
{\a1}Ça dure une éternité.
Des trucs compliqués, sûrement.
C'est plutôt Joe
qui les rend compliquées.
Ce renoi kiffe la conversation.
Pas comme Marlo.
Absolument pas.
Tu vois, ce pasteur,
c'est un des trois
à qui j'aime donner mon argent.
Je l'aide dans ses bonnes oeuvres.
Bonnes oeuvres ?
Tous types de travaux de missionnaire
dans les îles.
Construire une église pour des gens,
une école pour d'autres,
des bonnes choses de ce genre.
Que faites-vous d'autre ?
Un hôpital.
Oui, un hôpital.
Sauf que c'est en chantier depuis 10 ans
et rien n'est encore terminé.
Comment mon fric sera blanchi ?
On a des comptes
dans les banques de ces îles.
Les dons entrent en liquide
et sortent en chèques de banque.
Les toutes Petites Antilles
ne font ni citations ni mandats,
- rien de ça.
- Tu payes 10 cents le dollar.
Au-dessus, ça dépend de ta générosité,
pour sauver ceux qui veulent l'être.
Je suis de retour.
Je vois ça.
La même chose.
J'ai vu ton texto aujourd'hui,
- ça m'a pris une minute pour tilter.
- Ça fait pas autant de temps.
Putain.
Quand t'es parti,
je couvrais encore le monde du travail.
On a pas de chargé au travail
depuis 3 ans.
Maintenant, tu es le grand méchant
rédac' chef du service local,
tandis que je me prostitue
pour les politiciens.
T'es parti au bon moment.
- À ce point ?
- Chicago
nous tue.
Un rachat après l'autre.
Je peux même pas imaginer
les prochaines négociations
avec la guilde.
Assez de pleurnicheries.
Qu'as-tu à vendre ce soir, cher Norman ?
Carcetti prévoit de virer Burrell.
Il en discute et cherche un remplaçant.
"Source à la mairie" ?
Le principal candidat ?
Rawls, adjoint aux opérations, pourrait
avoir le poste pour quelques mois,
mais il y a un favori dans la police :
Cedric Daniels.
Ça fait un moment que je suis
en dehors de ça. Qui est ce Daniels ?
Chef de la Criminelle. Châtié.
Diplômé en droit.
A conclu plusieurs grosses enquêtes.
Son ex-femme a été élue au conseil
aux dernières élections.
J'aime qu'il y ait des photos
avec mes histoires.
C'est destiné à qui ? Hein ?
Les pasteurs ?
Nerese ?
Pour savoir
s'ils supporteraient ce type ?
OK.
D'une putain à une autre.
Putain ?
Mate-moi ça.
Superbe.
Purée.
Regarde-moi cet enculé.
Mets-lui le projecteur.
Criminelle. Fallait s'en douter.
Vous voulez aller où ?
À Six Flags.
Aller-retour ?
200 plus l'essence.
T'es où ?
150, essence comprise,
si ce truc nous y amène.
Te tracasse pas pour la caisse.
Cette gova tient le coup.
D'accord.
La moitié quand on sera là-bas
et l'autre au retour.
Chaud pour un article ?
J'ai un truc urgent.
- Quoi ?
- Le maire
envisage de virer le préfet.
L'idée est dans l'air,
- en tout cas.
- Pas de souci, je suis dessus.
Que sais-tu de Daniels ?
- C'est qui ?
- Chef de la brigade criminelle.
Vient des Stups de l'Est.
Marié à la Daniels
élue au conseil en 2006.
A mené des grosses enquêtes d'écoute.
On lui a confié le district Ouest,
espérant qu'il le nettoie
après le renvoi de Bunny Colvin.
Après sa séparation,
il s'est mis avec Ronnie Pearlman,
du cabinet du procureur de l'État.
Aucun appui dans sa carrière,
mais maintenant
qu'il a l'oreille de Carcetti,
il est à l'abri des supérieurs.
Et sa couleur préférée ?
T'es sûr ?
Oui. Je suis déjà au boulot.
- <i>Bureau de l'adjoint.</i>
- Salut, chérie.
C'est Roger Twigg du <i>Sun</i>.
- L'adjoint est là ?
- <i>Oui.</i>
Merci, trésor.
J'aurais pu le faire en à peine 2 h.
J'en doute pas.
Pendant que M. Bois mort
bosse son article,
tâche de lui trouver des citations.
C'est un don généreux, mais...
ton argent, l'argent que tu m'apportes,
j'en ai pas besoin.
Ça reste de l'argent.
En recevoir d'un autre
vous change quoi ?
C'est de l'argent sale.
Il pue.
- On est pas dans le même business ?
- Les billets viennent de la rue.
Ils sont sales. Tu comprends ?
Tout passe par Joe.
Tout est propre avec Joe.
Pas de problème.
Bien.
Au revoir.
Tu as dit que c'était quel type de noeud
sur le ruban rouge ?
Sur le poignet du SDF.
Encule-toi avec ton ruban rouge.
Je viens d'y penser, j'ai eu
un clochard qui avait un ruban rouge
à son poignet.
Tu t'en souviens ?
Sacrée prise, inspecteur. Sacrée prise.
Je peux voir ton dossier ?
Propres ?
Tu veux dire blanchis ?
Je viens de te montrer...
Nan. Propres,
comme l'argent sortant
tout droit de la banque. Tout joli.
Tu vois, les gens sont pas bien.
Tu veux payer un enculé
et il se soucie
que de l'allure des fafs.
D'habitude, mon tarot
est de 20 cents le dollar.
40 000 pour le rendre joli.
Et t'en as besoin aujourd'hui, en plus.
En temps normal,
j'aurais fait payer plus.
Mais comme on coopère, pas de frais.
À propos de la coop,
dis à ceux qui se sont fait plumer
que j'offre 50 pour une info
sur des proches d'Omar.
Sa soeur, sa mamie,
un pédé avec qui il a été.
Tout ça, ça compte. Entendu ?
- Je réveille pas le chien qui dort.
- Je le sais, Joe.
Tu es intelligent. Mais moi ?
Bref,
faites passer cette offre.
Ce sera prêt d'ici une heure.
Il veut Omar grave.
Je lui donnerai rien sur Omar.
Omar est parti.
Emportant avec lui
tous les ennuis passés.
Pour quelle raison je voudrais
que cet enculé revienne ?
À ton avis, on allait à combien
dans la première chute ?
- 120 à l'heure.
- C'est tout ?
J'avais l'impression
de décoller de mon siège.
Comment tu connais ces trucs-là ?
Là-bas !
Vous aussi, vous lancez.
Mettez-y votre petite touche.
Regardez.
Mets de l'effet,
sinon ça va tomber à côté.
Tiens ça.
- C'est où, Fairfax ?
- Virginie du Nord.
- Et toi, t'es d'où ?
- Baltimore.
C'est trop cool.
Vous avez votre propre appart ?
- Oui, avec Bug.
- Ça déchire.
Un malade dans la nature, hein ?
Déjà trois affaires reliées.
Il tue des clochards, c'est ça ?
Je t'aurai prévenu.
Qui nous couvre pour le <i>Sun</i>
de nos jours ? Twigg ?
Lui ou cette nouvelle fille.
Alma quelque chose.
<i>Baltimore Sun</i>. Gutierrez.
Je peux vous rencontrer ?
Vous connaissez le Al Pacino's ?
Dans une demi-heure, ça vous va ?
Bien. À tout à l'heure.
Bonne citation
de ma part sur l'intranet.
Scott, viens voir.
Cette citation, là.
"Carcetti tient peut-être le couteau,
mais Daniels l'a aiguisé pour lui.
"Il critique Burrell depuis l'élection."
De la bonne, hein ?
De la part d'une source haut placée
à la mairie ?
Ça te gêne pas de me dire
d'où tu tiens ça ?
Si, plutôt, étant une source.
C'est une super citation, mais...
si tu veux critiquer quelqu'un
de façon anonyme,
je dois au moins être sûr
que ça vient...
Nerese Campbell.
Elle va pas critiquer
le choix du maire publiquement,
mais en non identifiée,
la citation est d'elle.
Obtenu ça de Nerese ?
Twigg n'est pas le seul
à avoir des ressources.
Dites à Vondas que je voulais pas
de malentendus tout à l'heure.
Comment savez-vous qu'elles sont
reliées ? Y a-t-il preuve ADN
ou signature ?
On ne peut pas encore annoncer ça.
Vous savez, les imitateurs.
Il y en a une.
Quoi ?
Vous êtes douée.
- Vous êtes nouvelle ?
- 5 mois.
Je travaillais au <i>Sun-Sentinel</i>
à Lauderdale.
J'ai lu vos articles. Ils sont bons.
Foutaises, mais merci.
Vous allez publier de suite ?
Il faut que ça se sache.
C'est quoi comme nom, Alma ?
- J'ai un petit ami, inspecteur.
- Oui ?
Il est plus grand que moi ?
Puis-je vous demander
pourquoi le jour en question,
vous conduisiez la voiture du sénateur
lors de votre arrestation par la police
avec 20 000 $ en liquide ?
Sur les conseils de mon avocat,
je vais pas répondre à ça.
Vous essayez
de me criminer.
M. Price, vous êtes employé comme
chauffeur pour le sénateur Davis,
gagnant 30 000 $ par an,
est-ce correct ?
- Oui, et alors ?
- Pourtant,
j'ai cru comprendre
que vous perceviez également
un salaire de 40 000 $
en tant que directeur général
de l'association Baltimore Ouest Basket
et encore 30 000 $
en tant que collecteur de fonds pour le
centre de services sociaux du sénateur.
Comment arrivez-vous
à gagner trois salaires,
à avoir trois emplois en même temps,
M. Price ?
Passez une bonne journée.
Un enculé d'aveugle.
Son bouge est sur Collington,
côté est de la rue.
Mais s'il balance Omar, je veux en être.
Ce renoi m'a foutu un tarpé à la gueule.
- Joe sait, pour Butchie ?
- Enculé, je sais, pour lui.
Joe sait que dalle sur ça,
et il a pas besoin de savoir.
Où est ma maille, mec ?
T'étais où, négro ?
Y avait pas cours,
on est sortis avec Bug. Aucun blème.
Si, quand tu préviens personne.
Toute la journée, j'ai dû m'assurer
que ton biz tournait.
C'est ton coin de rue ?
Je viens m'assurer que tout est
pépère à la fin de la journée, OK ?
- Yo, le compte est bon ?
- Oui. Parfait.
C'est pas le problème, et tu le sais.
Chris est déjà au courant.
Joli dauphin, négro.
On rentre, mec.
Je réglerai ces conneries plus tard.
Ça fait 400 dans ton compte aux îles.
Aucun ouragan, ministère de la justice
ou négro avec un flingue
peut t'enlever ça.
Comment je sais qu'il y est ?
Tu vérifies sur le Net quand tu veux.
Sur un ordinateur ?
- Si je peux pas le toucher...
- OK.
T'as déjà eu des condamnations ?
Non, rien d'important.
On t'obtient un passeport, alors.
Déplace-toi.
C'est pas facile
de civiliser cet enculé.
On a fait le mauvais choix, Gus.
À ce rythme-là, on pourra plus tellement
parler de journal dans 10 ans.
Tu sais, mon père a travaillé à Armco.
Tous les matins avant d'aller au boulot,
il se mettait à table,
lisait le journal
une tasse de café à dispo.
Personne ne pouvait le déranger
les 15 minutes avant de partir.
Me souviens, je me disais :
"Qu'est-ce que ce fichu journal
a de si important ?"
"Je veux en faire partie."
Il m'a donné envie
de devenir journaliste.
Un jour, je séchais les cours,
à Patterson.
Il y avait cet homme dans le bus
qui pliait son grand journal comme ça.
La façon dont cet homme
pliait ce journal
et s'appliquait à lire ces pages,
ça lui donnait l'image
du plus intelligent dans le bus.
C'était un de ces moments marquants.
"Si jamais je quittais cette vallée,
"que tu repenses à moi un jour,
"et que tu veuilles contenter mon âme,
"pardonne à un pécheur
"et cligne de l'oeil à une fille terne."
Nique Henry Mencken.
Je te pardonne, Gus.
<i>Le maire envisage
un grand remaniement dans la police</i>
Et la citation de quelqu'un comme quoi
je poignarderais Burrell dans le dos ?
C'est qu'un sale mensonge.
Et alors ?
Tu vas être nommé préfet.
C'est une bonne nouvelle.
Comment ça ne l'est pas ?
Merci.
Sale putain de rapiat.
<i>Des meurtres de sans-abri
pourraient être reliés</i>
Non, tu vois.
Si tu mets ça avec la bière domestique,
je saurai pas.
N'éprouve pas un aveugle, t'entends ?
- Vous servez ?
- Si tu as une carte d'identité.
C'était qui ?
Une petite fille.
- L'argent est dans la caisse.
- Nique la caisse, le vieux.
Ils sont après toutes tes affaires.
Ils s'en prennent à tout.
Tu m'entends ?
On va aller en taule.
Concentre-toi, enculé.
Concentre-toi !
Regarde.
Au niveau des affiches de femmes,
sous l'article sur...
le conseil d'administration approuvant
un changement de nom pour l'école 114,
c'est l'éventreur de Jimmy McNulty.
Pourquoi on les appelle sans-abri ?
Car ils ont pas de pot où pisser.
Et tu sais pourquoi ?
Car tout le monde s'en balance.
Continue un jour ou deux,
puis t'es de retour dans la rotation.
T'as fini avec ces conneries ?
Qui doit te le dire, Jimmy ?
Tu dois informer Burrell
que ça ne vient pas de toi.
Ça ne changera rien.
Après ce qu'il a lu, je suis la menace.
Tu lui dis donc que tu refuses le poste,
que tu ne veux pas son fauteuil.
Et il me croira ?
L'alternative est qu'il parle
publiquement de ce qu'il sait,
ce qu'il a sur le passé.
- Il s'est assis dessus jusque-là.
- Tu l'as dit toi-même,
il préfère enterrer le fichier
que ternir le service sous son nom.
Mais s'il est question de survie
entre toi et lui,
que crois-tu alors qu'il fera ?
Et qu'y aurait-il dans ce dossier ?
Une enquête sur les biens ?
Des propos inconsidérés ?
Ça remonte. La plupart de ces gars
sont passés à autre chose.
Il n'a besoin que de fumée.
Il n'a même pas besoin de feu
pour te discréditer,
pour me discréditer.
Tout ce pour quoi on a travaillé si dur.
On a déjà assez perdu.
Quels autres proches a Omar ?
C'est ce suceur qui a des blèmes.
Pas besoin de garder la tête haute.
C'est pas obligé de devenir moche.
Y a pas d'autre issue. Je peux le voir.
Où je peux trouver Omar ?
Où est Omar ?
T'es un dur, le vieux.
Quand Omar apprendra,
assure-toi qu'il sache tout.
On a toujours aucune info sur lui.
Maintenant, il va s'en prendre à nous.
On va changer nos habitudes.
Marlo doit rester en intérieur.
Le reste, on va vivre à l'affût.
Plan de traviole, si tu veux mon avis.
Marlo veut Omar.
C'est tout ce qu'y a à savoir.
Vous passez à l'action contre Burrell,
je vous comprends.
Le truc, c'est que je peux vous aider.
Les pasteurs,
Nerese, le caucus législatif noir...
Je peux les amener à vous.
Libre à vous.
J'ai seulement besoin d'aide
avec cette absurdité de grand jury.
- Allez voir Bond. Dites à Bond...
- Je ne peux vous aider.
L'article est sorti depuis ce matin,
et notre téléphone n'a pas sonné.
Les pasteurs, Nerese, le caucus sont
prêts à accepter Daniels apparemment.
Merci quand même.
Croyez pouvoir lâcher Clay, hein ?
Croyez que je suis fini.
Je viens voir mon compte.
Vous avez mon fric ?
C'est à moi.
Vous avez mon fric.
Quoi ?
Donc, tu relies le meurtre de Barlow
et l'affaire de Cole avec la tienne,
ce qui est naturel au départ...
Un tueur en série de type instantané,
ce qui amènerait les chefs
à envoyer de l'argent
pour de vraies affaires.
- Comme Marlo.
- Comme Marlo.
Des trucs comme ça
traversent ton cerveau ?
Si tu veux pas écouter ton coéquipier,
Lester a toute la sagesse requise.
La blague, c'est que tout le monde
se fout d'un tueur en série,
à moins qu'il découpe
de jolies étudiantes ou autre.
Le <i>Sun</i> a mis l'histoire
dans les dernières pages.
Tu as merdé.
Oui. Dis-lui.
Non. Si tu veux bien faire,
un simple étranglement ne suffit pas.
Pas si c'est un clochard.
Sensationnalise la chose.
Donne au tueur un fantasme glauque,
quelque chose de moche,
de très moche.
Ça doit accrocher les coeurs
et les esprits,
donner aux gens
ce qu'ils attendent d'un tueur en série.
- Lester, putain ?
- Non. Tu es sur une piste intéressante.
Je peux faire tomber Marlo
en quelques semaines. Tu arranges bien
les choses, tu peux tout me refiler.
On s'en fout si on simule deux-trois
meurtres qu'on résoudra jamais.
Les morts s'en tapent.
Tout le monde s'en tape.
Mais si ça pousse les chefs
à jeter assez de sous pour le travail...
Sans moi.
Je m'en vais.
On doit donner à ton tueur un nom.
On doit tuer de nouveau.
<i>Poppy</i>, faudrait s'en préparer un,
un soir.
- Oui, tu l'as dit.
- Un bon petit dîner.
Omar, Omar !
Une seconde, une seconde !
Bon. Tenez.
- <i>Mañana, poppy</i>. Demain, OK ?
- Demain.
<i>Mana, poppy</i>.
<i>Mana</i>, Alexis.
Yo, 'Naldo.
Le cousin doit trouver
où ils ont des Honey Nut, yo,
s'ils veulent qu'on appelle
ce bout de terre chez-soi.

Type quieter, asshole.
Early relief.
So get the fuck out of here.
Jesus, Bunk.
What time is it?
4:30.
I couldn't sleep, so
get the fuck gone.
what time did Mcnulty
leave last night?
Never did.
He's in number one.
Pulling his hair out
over some shit.
Think again about what
the fuck you're doing.
Bunk, this can work.
It can.
Fuck you. I mean that.
4:00 in the fuckin' morning?
Oh, so it is.
All of these?
Homeless murders
from the last 5 years.
Everything before that is on microfilm,
but we got enough right here
Most of it open.
We don't do so well
with homeless kilings.
Transient locales,
no nearest, no dearest.
No one gives a fuck.
Cases stay open forever.
- You're going to jail behind this shit.
- Yes, you are.
You know what they do
to police in jail?
Pretty police like yourself?
Motherfucker,
1we have kids.
Houses.
Car payments.
Furniture.
I just bought brand-new lawn chairs
and a glass patio table.
You don't buy no shit like that if you
plan to lose your job
and go to prison.
- You won't even get past the m.e.
- Watch me.
You're dumping murders on us
that we can't solve.
- You're fucking our clearance rate.
- Fuck the fucking numbers already.
The fucking numbers destroyed
this fucking department.
Landsman and his clearance
rate can suck a hairy asshole.
Marlo ain't worth it.
Nobody is.
Marlo's an asshole.
He does not get to win.
We get to win.
This case doesn't go away
just because the bosses
can't find the money to pay for it.
These are fucking murders--
Ghetto murders, but still,
I came back out of the western
to work this case
because they said it would be worked.
I came back out on a promise,
and they're gonna keep that promise.
Whether they know it or not.
I'm gonna tell landsman.
Yeah. You keep on with it,
I'm gonna rat you out.
You do what you got to do.
My name is
nowhere in the file.
I don't want fuck to do with this.
Hey, Bunk.
Captioning made possible
by home box office, inc.
What're you doing?
Final is out.
I want to see my story.
Now?
It's my first time out front.
I want to see it.
This is why we should
get home delivery.
Why pay for it when I get
it for free at the office?
Be back.
Brother ray.
God rest ye.
When does the "sun" get here?
Around now usually.
- Anybody got a working car?
- I got one,
but I'm going back out
to my crime scene for a canvass.
Drop me at the m.e.?
My office now.
I'll get a lift over
from one of the central cars.
This is way past any shit
you ever pulled in your life.
- Think on it.
- You see Greggs out there,
bagging evidence alone,
then going back out
to recanvass on a triple?
A triple fucking murder.
A home invasion,
and she's working it alone.
They pulled Crutchfield this morning,
put him back in the rotation.
- That's on them, but you can't--
- Fucking right, that's on them.
A triple murder,
and 12 hours later
they leave one detective alone on it?
I guess she's lucky
she has a car.
- This shit won't work.
- Then we're no worse than before.
- Extra red name or two on the board.
- Yeah, unless you got caught.
Who in this fucking unit
is gonna catch me?
Most of the guys up here couldn't catch
the clap in a mexican whorehouse.
What's with the red ribbon?
Barlow had an open strangle
a few years back.
Homeless guy with a red ribbon
tied around his wrist.
So that's two.
Also, I found an open homeless
case which Ray Cole worked.
I wrote a ribbon
into his office reports.
- So there's 3.
- Our guy didn't have a red ribbon.
- That's where I'm headed.
- Jesus.
- Listen to yourself.
- Upstairs
wouldn't jump on a real serial killer--
fuckin' Marlo,
who's got bodies all over hi
maybe they need the make-believe.
Yeah, maybe you're the asshole
just lost his fucking mind.
- <i>Crutchfield.</i>
- Yeah, I'm locked in the box.
- <i>In the box?</i>
- It's no joke. Let me out.
<i>Be right there.</i>
He fuck you?
He tried...
But mostly he just fucks himself.
You ain't seen those yet, huh?
I'll bet you didn't.
Fucking Burrell's asshole
must be so tight
you couldn't pull a pin from it
with a John Deere tractor.
Here you're promising
a double-digit drop,
and he gives you
a 4% bump
for two quarters in a row.
Thanks for bringing these by, Stan.
Well, I wanted to
give you a heads up.
Truth is,
looking at numbers like those,
I'm thinking you could do a lot worse
than give me a run
as acting commissioner.
I know you couldn't make me permanent.
maybe 6 months
while you keep grooming
your boy Daniels.
I'd get a pension bump,
and you'd get a head start
on clearing out deadwood,
beginning with Burrell
and Rawls.
Thanks, Stan.
Let me think on it.
You do that, Tommy.
Even on an acting basis,
can you imagine
Nerese and the Ministers dealing
with commissioner Valchek?
What are you gonna do
about the numbers?
Fuck can I do? I cut the department
budget to the bone, right?
Can't very well complain
when the crime rate bumps.
Burrell comes in here
and owns these,
I got to give him a pass--
at least until I can fix
his money problems.
Your piece took a bad bite there.
35 inches down to 12?
Yeah, well, it's my fault
for giving it up to the a-section.
Page one editor made
noises like it was
gonna go out front. Then he...
ossed it back to metro
before the double-dot.
Night editor didn't have room
to take it back, so...
Story deserved better. Sorry.
3 people murdered in a house,
and it gets 12 inches below the fold.
- Explain that to me.
- There's no explaining it.
Advertising's down,
we got a smaller news hole,
we're not managing it well.
We messed up.
That's all.
Wrong zip code.
They're dead where it doesn't count.
If they were white
and murdered in Tmonium,
you'd have had 30 inches off the front.
Would have been my first front-pager
where I didn't share a byline.
Yeah?
I drove down to the port covington plant
this morning to get a copy.
Well, you ain't the first to do that.
Our 10-7 on e floor yet?
He's by the overhead camera.
I need to grab prints,
get him I.D.ed.
Don't you want to wait for the post,
keep his hands clean for trace?
I need to know who my victim is.
That's the priority.
Finish your breakfast.
I got plenty of time.
There's nothing under the nails
that I can see.
I think we can risk prints.
Something's up.
Please. Gather around.
Steve, could someone get word
across the hall to features and sports?
We want everyone on this.
What, did we get sold again?
First the "L.A. Times" buys us up,
then the "Tribune."
Law of the fish.
- We're the minnow.
- Maybe we won a Pulitzer.
Pulitzers are still a week away.
It just turned April.
Look at Whiting's pants.
If we won a Pulitzer,
the executive editor would be tumescent.
Toom-what?
Speak English.
I'm just a police reporter.
Tumescent. Engorged.
Exactly.
It's a bad time for newspapers,
as you all know.
The news hole is shrinking
as advertising dollars
continue to decline.
Our circulation numbers
are also down as we compete with a
variety of media.
Technology is driving distribution,
and the Internet
is a free source of news and opinions.
Seeking a balance in this new world,
we're now faced with hard choices.
We opened our first foreign
bureau in London in 1924.
The "Sun's" foreign coverage
has been a source of pride ever since.
So it is with
tremendous regret
that I tell you that Chicago
has made it clear that the bureaus
in Beijing,
Moscow, Jerusalem,
Johannesburg, and London
will all be shuttered.
Elsewhere in the newsroom,
there will be
a fresh round of buyouts.
Chicago has given us some specific
budgetary targets
that will require some hard choices
throughout the newsroom.
We are, quite simply,
going to have to find ways
to do more with less.
So I guess I will
turn this over to tom,
who will get into the specifics.
I know some of you have questions.
If you could hold them for me
until after I've had a chance to speak.
Pull your clipbook together.
Time to find a new home.
Chicago has sent us a memo
outlining options that are
available to those of you...
The aorta should have elasticity to it,
t it's rock hard.
Whoever strangled him could've
just waited a month or two more.
This guy was on his last legs.
It is what it is.
In addition to the fractured hyoid
and the bruising,
I got signs of a struggle
around the body,
a couple witnesses
who thought they heard sounds
of a struggle inside the house.
Also that ribbon you snipped off,
it might tie to other cases.
The ribbon my own investigator
missed at the scene.
It happens.
It was high on the wrist.
Cause and manner
is homicide by strangulation.
Good hunting, detective.
"and anyone requiring
additional information
"on cobra benefits
and pension payout as part
"of the voluntary separation plan
can schedule an appointment
with human resources."
Some of you will migrate
into new positions
while others will of course
be moving on to other opportunities
beyond the <i>Sun</i>,
but everyone in this room
has done excellent work
and should be proud
of their contributions.
- How many buyouts are there?
- That hasn't been determined yet.
We're talking to the union later today.
How'll this affect the upcoming contract
negotiations with the guild?
Badly.
Kiss any raise good-bye.
How come there's cuts in the newsroom
when the company's still profitable?
There's nobody that feels
worse about this than I do.
I've seen the excellent work
we've done here in Baltimore.
The sooner we start
meeting with you individually,
the sooner I can answer
all of your questions.
- Not O'mara.
- Yeah.
Aw, no.
Good luck everybody.
No increase in felonies
and a 1% bump in total crime.
Do you vouch for these figures?
- Sir?
- No increase in crime
even after I cut you guys to the bone.
This is what you're telling me?
Because the one thing I'm
asking of you guys--
the one thing
that I'm asking above all--
is that you bring me clean numbers.
Yes, Mr. Mayor.
You made that clear.
Very good then.
Burrell is done.
He just killed himself.
We leak the real stats,
hold the cooked ones
in case he won't go quietly.
And replace him with who?
Rawls?
He came in with the same stats.
If I know Bill Rawls,
he'll be calling over here as
soon as he gets back to his office,
telling us he warned Burrell
against cooking the books.
The ministers won't live with Rawls.
Neither will Nerese.
As acting commissioner,
they will for a few months at least
if we've got a black
candidate to sell them.
Daniels isn't ready.
He's only been Colonel for a year.
A year will do in a pinch.
You float it with one of your
bunkies on Calvert street.
See how it plays.
Burrell reads that,
he'll shit melons.
I fucking hope so.
It's Baltimore.
No one lives forever.
Andreas, right?
The Russian sent me.
Need you to get a word to Vondas.
He got a new friend.*
I never hear the name.
Just let him know Marlo
came past with a gift.
Be at you same time tomorrow.
Any idea how long this could take?
Don't know.
Might be here all day.
I have meetings scheduled.
We've got to lay
the foundation carefully,
make it so the grand jurors understand
all the ins and outs
so they don't get lost in the details.
Mr. Howard?
Is there any way
I could go earlier?
If you're important enough, sure.
I'm the vice president
of a major financial institution.
Who the fuck isn't?
Now, sir, directing your attention
to the document in your hand,
is that also an account statement?
Yes, it is,
for a non-profit,
interest-bearing account,
organizational,
with 5013 designation.
Can begin by slowly
explaining in the most basic terms
each of those things,
beginning with the word non-profit?
- Hey, is box two open?
- Not yet.
What about 3?
Someone's killing homeless men.
Medical examiner says so.
Weird thing about my case, Bunk?
Dead man was homeless,
but he had a red ribbon
tied around his wrist.
What does a homeless guy
have to remember
that he should have a red ribbon
tied around his wrist?
- Burlow.
- What?
Nice out.
Oh, like Chanel no. 5
comes out of your ass, moreland.
If you got a problem,
then I got a problem.
That's how the co-op work.
What's the problem?
I got too much money.
Son, believe me,
you ain't alone.
What to do with the shit
we sell ain't no thing.
In Baltimore,
dope and coke sell themselves,
but the money that come back?
Ain't enough mattresses, is there now?
You got any ideas?
A few.
If you askin'.
- Not Twigg.
- Damn.
Guy gives 20 years to the paper,
and this how it ends?
Fact of the matter is,
it's more profitable these days
to run a worse paper for less money.
Cut back people and pages,
you increase revenue.
If we're lucky,
they'll just get rid of deadwood.
How'd it go?
"You've done excellent work."
Without being explicit,
they gave me a choice--
either the copy desk or the buyout.
- You're kidding, right?
- Apparently,
they can hire
one-and-a-half 20-somethings
for what it costs to keep
me in print, so...
Damn, Roger.
- Sorry, man.
- Fuck it.
I might as well get to work
on the <i>Great American Novel</i>.
<i>Gus, come on in.</i>
Have a seat.
Relax, gus.
We need you here.
We value your dedication.
You've done excellent work.
We're counting on you
to transition the new team.
There's still going to be
excellent talent out there
- that needs to be developed.
- What kind of team's going to be left?
We're losing good people,
but we expect to retain
the core of a solid staff.
Doing more with less.
That's what we have
to contemplate going forward.
More with less, huh?
Look at this.
A red ribbon in one
of Ray Cole's files.
Cole left a note with it.
"Found on left wrist of victim.
Check against other cases."
Hey, hon.
How's the stain look on the cabinets?
They dry yet?
Great.
I'm on my way.
This is the hard part,
getting these guys to give a shit.
Let's get a taste. I'm buying.
You think I'm drinking with you?
Go home, Jimmy.
- Think your weak shit through, man.
- Go home?
For the love of God,
I'm working a serial killer.
You want to talk on it?
Went with Chris and them,
set up on this family.
Everything so serious now.
Yo, little man, you
finish your howork?
'cause it's late now,
and it's only gonna get later
if we don't roll home soon.
Ain't no school tomorrow.
Teacher meetings.
We should do something, mike.
Got my corner to run.
What?
What, nigga?
Six Flags be open again.*
That shit's taking forever.
Complicated stuff, I suppose.
It's more like
Joe make it complicated.
That nigga got a thing
for conversation.
Not like Marlo.
Definitely not.
Now, see, pastor here,
he one of about 3
I like to give money to.
Help with his good works
and all that.
Good works?
He down with all kind of missionary work
going on down in the islands.
You know,
building a church for some folk,
a schoolhouse for some other folks,
all kind of good shit like that.
And what else y'all building?
- A hospital.
- Hospital, yeah.
Except they been building that mess
for about 10 years now,
and nothing ever actually get finished.
How you gonna clean my money?
Got accounts at some
of the banks down there.
Donations come in as cash,
cashier's checks come out.
Tiny-ass Caribbean island
don't truck with no subpoenas,
no court orders,
- none of that.
- You pay 10 on the dollar.
Anything beyond that
depends on your generosity,
to save those who want to be saved.
I'm back.
I can see that.
Again.
I saw your text message
on my cell phone today,
it took me a minute remember
who the hell you were.
- It ain't been that long.
- Shit.
When you left,
I was still covering the labor beat.
We ain't had a labor reporter
around here in 3 years.
Yeah, well, now you the big,
bad city editor,
I'm whoring myself for politicians.
You got out
just at the right time, too.
- That bad, huh?
- Chicago is killing us.
One buyout after another.
I can't even begin to think
what our next round
of guild negotiations is gonna be like.
Enough of me crying.
What are you selling tonight,
dear Norman?
Carcetti's planning
to shitcan Burrell.
He's talking to people and
considering replacements.
City hall source?
Who's the leading candidate?
Rawls, deputy for operations,
might have the job for a few months,
but there's a front runner
from deeper in the department.
Cedric Daniels.
It's been a while since
I've been on the street there, Orman.
Who's this Daniels?
Chief of detectives.
Polished.
Holds a law degree.
Brought closure
to some high-level cases.
His ex-wife got herself
elected to the council last go-round.
I always liked photos
with my stories.
And this is aimed at who?
The ministers?
Nerese?
You want to see if they can live
with this fella here, right?
A- ight.
From one whore to another.
What the fuck?
Check this shit out.
Beautiful.
Holy shit.
Look at this motherfucker.
Hit him with the spot.
C.I.d. Figures, don't it?
Where y'all need to go?
Down Six Flags.
You talkin' round trip?
Run you two hundred plus gas.
Where you at?
I got 150, gas included
if it even get us there.
Don't be fretting on the ride now.
This motherfucker tried and true.
A- ight.
I got half when we get there
and half on the way back.
I guess you're not up for a story.
- I need something worked on right away.
- What do you got?
Mayor's thinking
about firing the police commissioner.
He's floating the idea anyway.
No problem. I'm all over it.
What do you know about Daniels?
- Who is he?
- C.I.D. Commander.
Came out of the eastern D.E.U.
married to the Daniels
that won the council seat in '06.
Brought in a couple
of big wiretap cases,
they gave him the western,
hoping to clean up that district
after they shitcanned Bunny Colvin.
Since getting separated, he's been
shacked up with Ronnie Pearlman
over at the state's attorney's office.
No suction early in his career,
but now that he's got Carcetti's ear,
now the brass stay out of his way.
What's the man's favorite color?
You sure?
Yeah, what the hell?
I'm already on the clock.
- <i>Ops bureau.</i>
- Hi, darlin'.
It's Roger Twigg
with the <i>Sunpapers</i>.
- <i>Hey, roger</i>.
- Is the deputy around?
- <i>Sure</i>.
- Thanks, hon.
An hour or two,
I'd have had it surrounded.
No doubt.
While Mr. Deadwood here's
working the story,
see if you can feed him
some react quotes.
It's a generous gift, but...
your money,
the money you bring me,
I don't need.
Money is money.
What's the difference
who bring it to you?
It's dirty money.
It stinks.
- We ain't in the same business?
- The bills are from the street.
They're dirty, you understand?
Everything runs through joe.
Everything is clean with Joe.
Ain't a problem.
Good.
Good-bye.
Hey, Bunk.
What kind of knot
you say was on that red ribbon?
The one on the homeless guy's wrist.
Ck yourself with your red ribbon.
Just thought of something.
I caught a vagrant months back had
a red ribbon tied around his wrist.
You remember that?
Hell of a catch, detective.
Hell of a catch.
Can I see your file?
Clean bills?
You mean laundered, right?
I just showed you how.
Naw. He mean clean,
like the money straight out
the bank and shit.
- All lookin' nice.
- See, people ain't right.
Here you are tryin'
to pay a motherfucker,
an' all he worried about
is what the money look like.
Normally, my fee for this
would be 20 on the dollar.
40,000 to make it look nice.
You need this back today, too.
Might ordinarily charge more,
but seeing as how we co-op,
no charge.
Speaking of co-op,
tell them niggas that got burnt
I'm givin' away 50
for a line on Omar's people.
His sister, his me-maw
some faggy he be with.
All that shit count, you hear me?
- I'd let sleeping dogs lie, son.
- Oh, I know you would, Joe.
You smart like that.
Me?
Anyway, pass that offer on.
Come back for this here in an hour.
Boy want omar bad.
I ain't giving him a thing on Omar.
Omar been gone.
Took a lot
of bad history with him, too.
Why in the hell would I want
that motherfucker back?
How fast you think we were
going on that first drop?
- 75 an hour.
- That's it?
Felt like I was coming out
of my seat, man.
You always knowing
stuff like that. How?
Ooh, over there!
Y'all throwin' some bricks.
Put a little touch on it.
Watch.
Put some backspin on it, or else
it'll bank off the box and not in it.
Hold this.
- So where Fairfax at?
- Northern Virginia.
- How about you?
- I live up Baltimore.
That's so cool.
You two have your own place?
- Yeah, and Bug.
- That's tight.
Madman on the loose, huh?
3 linked cases and counting.
He's killing vagrants, is he?
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Who covers us for the
<i>Sunpapers</i> nowadays? Twigg?
Him or this new girl.
Alma something.
<i>Baltimore Sun</i>. Gutierrez.
Ok. Can I meet you?
Do you know Al Pacino's?
How about half an hour?
Ok. See you then.
Good react quote from
me in metro write.
Scott, come here.
This quote, here.
"Carcetti may be holng the knife,
but Daniels sharpened it for him.
He's been critical
of Burrell since the election."
Good shit, huh?
Yeah, from a high-ranking
city hall source?
You feel comfortable telling me
where you got that?
Not really, it being a source.
It's a great quote, but, uh,
if you're gonna-- if you're gonna
slam somebody anonymously,
I at least have to be sure
that the quote--
Nerese Campbell.
She's not gonna slam
the Mayor's choice publicly,
but not-for-attribution,
that's her quote.
You got Nerese to say that, huh?
Twigg's not the only guy
with game around here.
Let Vondas know I ain't mean
no misunderstanding earlier.
How do you know they're connected?
Is there D.N.A. Evidence
or a signature?
We can't release that yet.
You know, copycats.
So there is a signature.
What?
You're good.
- You're new, right?
- 5 months.
I worked at the <i>Sun-sentinel</i>
in Lauderdale before this.
I've read your stories.
They're good.
Bullshit, but thanks.
You're gonna run
something right away, right?
We got to get the word out on this.
What kind of name is Alma?
I have a boyfriend, detective.
He bigger than me?
Can I ask you why
on the day in question
you were operating the senator's car
when you were detained by city police
with $20,000 in cash?
On advice of my attorney,
I ain't gonna answer that.
Ya'll trying to criminate me here.
Mr. Price, you are employed
as a driver for senator Davis,
earning 30,000 a year,
is that correct?
- Yeah, so?
- Yet,
it is my understanding that
you are also drawing a $40,000 salary
as the executive director
of the west Baltimore hoops charity
and another 30,000
as the fundraising director
for the senator's day-care initiative.
How are you able to earn 3 salaries,
working 3 jobs
at the same time, Mr. Price?
You have a nice day.
Blind motherfucker.
His joint on Collington
on the east side of the street.
If he give up Omar, though,
I want in on that shit.
Nigga put a gun in my face, man.
- Joe know about Butchie?
- Motherfucker, I know about him.
Joe don't know shit about this here,
and he ain't need to know.
Now where my cheese at, man?
The fuck you been at, nigga?
Wasn't no school today, so we took Bug
to do something. Ain't no thing.
It is when you don't tell no one.
Now I had to come down here all day long
to make sure your shit is straight.
This your corner or what, nigga?
I'm checking now to make sure
shit's right at the end of the day,
a-ight?
- Yo, count right?
- Yeah. All straight.
Ain't the point, and you know it.
Chris already heard about this shit.
Nice dolphin, nigga.
Let's go home, man.
I'll deal with this bullshit later.
That's 400 in your own
account down in the islands.
There no hurricane,
department of justice,
or nigga with a gun can tap that.
How I even know it's there?
You check it online
any time you like.
On a computer?
- If I can't hold it in my hand--
- A- ight.
You got any prior convictions?
No, nothing that rate.
We get you a passport then.
Take a trip.
Ain't easy civilizing
this motherfucker.
We chose poorly, gus.
At this rate, there won't be much
to call a newspaper in 10 years.
You know, my father
worked over at armco, right?
And every morning
before he went to work,
he'd sit at the table,
reading the newspaper
with a cup of coffee,
and no one could interupt him
for that 15 minutes
before he walked out the door,
and I remember watching him, thinking,
"What the hell is so important
about that damned paper?
I want to be part of that."
Made me want to be a newspaperman.
One day I was cutting class
at Patterson,
and there was this man
on the downtown bus
folding his broadsheet just so.
And the way that man folded that paper
and concentrated on reading those pages
made him look like the smartest
son of a bitch on the bus.
It was just one of those moments.
"If, ever I depart this vale,
"and you ever remember me
"and have thought to please my ghost,
"forgive some sinner,
"and wink your eye
at some homely girl."
Fuck Henry Mencken.
I forgive you, gus.
Oh, my God.
You see that quote from somebody
about me stabbing Burrell in the back?
That's a damn lie.
So what?
You're going to be
named commissioner.
This is good news.
How is this not good news?
Thanks.
Cheap motherfucker.
No, no, see.
If you stack it with the domestic beer,
then I won't know.
Cut a blind man some slack, hear?
- Y'all servin'?
- If you got some I.D. on you.
Who was that?
Little girl.
- Cash is in the register.
- Fuck the register, old man.
They all up in your shit.
They going after every damn thing.
Do you hear me?
We going to jail.
Focus, motherfucker, focus!
Look here.
Back in the girdle ads
underneath the story about the-
the school board approving
a name change for p.s. 114,
it's--
it's Jimmy Mcnulty's ripper.
You know why they call them homeless?
Because they ain't got a pot to piss in,
and you know why they ain't got a pot?
Because nobody gives a good fuck.
Shake it for another day or two,
and then you're back in the rotation.
You done with this stupid shit?
Who the fuck do you need
to hear it from, Jimmy?
You have to let Burrell know
that this isn't coming from you.
That won't matter.
After what he read today,
I'm the threat.
Then you have to tell him
that you won't take the job,
that you don't want his chair.
And he believes me?
The alternative is that he goes public
with what he knows,
whatever he has about the old days.
- He sat on it this long.
- You said yourself,
he'd rather bury that file than to
embarrass the department on his watch,
but if it's between you
and him surviving,
what do you think he'll do then?
How much could even be in that file?
An assets investigation?
Some loose talk?
It was so long ago.
Most of those guys have moved on.
He only needs smoke.
He doesn't even need fire
to drag you down,
to drag me down.
Everything that we have
worked so hard for.
We've already lost enough.
What other people Omar got?
Cosucker the one got the trouble.
No need for you to stand tall on it.
It don't have to be messy.
Ain't no other way.
I can see that.
Where I find Omar?
Where Omar at?
You a tough old man.
When word get to Omar,
make sure he hear everything.
We still ain't got no line on the man,
and now he comin' at us.
We gonna change up.
Marlo got to move indoors.
The rest of us need to live on the run.
Fucked-up plan, you ask me.
Marlo wants Omar.
What else you need to know?
You making your move on Burrell,
and I don't blame you,
and the thing is,
I can help with that.
The ministers, Nerese,
black legislative caucus--
- I can bring them around for you.
- Feel free.
All I need is some help
with this grand jury nonsense.
You go to Bond,
- you tell Bond that--
- I can't help you with that.
Story's been out all day,
and our phone isn't ringing.
The ministers, Nerese, the caucus,
they're willing
to live with Daniels apparently.
Thanks anyway.
Thinking you can cut Clay loose, huh?
Thinking I'm done.
Bonjour.
Came to see my account.
Vous parlez pas francais?
Y'all got my money?
Je ne parle pas anglais.
This mine.
- Y'all got my money.
- Oui, monsieur.
J'ai juste besoin de ça.
S'il vous plaît,
est-ce que je pourrais avoir le...
ça.
Merci.
Identification,
s'il vous plait.
What?
- Ça.
- Yeah.
Oui.
Merci.
OK, monsieur Marlo.
So you string together
Barlow's murder
and Cole's unconnected case and yours,
which is natural to begin with...
Instant serial killer,
which I thought would get the brass
to begin kicking out some money
to work real cases.
Like Marlo.
Like Marlo.
Shit like this actually goes
through your fucking brain?
If you don't want listen to me,
then listen to Lester.
He has all the wisdom you need.
Joke of it is, no one gives
a fuck about a serial killer,
not unless he's carving up
some pretty coed or some shit.
<i>Sunpapers</i> put the story
in their back pages.
Eh, you fucked up.
Yeah. Tell him.
No. I mean, if you want to do it right,
a straight-up strangle's not enough.
Not if it's some vagrant.
Sensationalize it.
Give the killer some fucked-up fantasy,
something bad, real bad.
It's got to grip the hearts and minds,
give the people what they want
from a serial killer.
- Lester, what the fuck?
- No. You're onto something.
I only need a few weeks
to pull down Marlo Stanfeld.
You fly this mess right,
you can give it to me.
Who gives a damn
if we fake a couple murders
that we're never gonna solve, huh?
The dead men don't care.
No one cares,
but if it's gonna get the bosses
to throw down
enough coin to do police work--
I'm out.
I'm out of here.
We got to give your killer a name.
We have to kill again.
<i>Poppy</i>, we've got to cook
one of these one night.
- Yeah, right on.
- Nice little dinner.
Omar, Omar, Omar!
Hold on, hold on, hold on!
All right, all right. Here you go.
- Mańana, <i>poppy</i>. Tomorrow, OK?
- Tomorrow.
Mana, <i>poppy</i>. No.
Mana, Alexis.
Hey, 'Naldo, cous got to find out
where they got honeynut, yo,
if they expect us
to call this spit o' land home.
<i>Recibía una llamada.</i>
<i>Tengo mala noticia.</i>

Qu'est-ce qu'il fout ? Les stups
sont toujours au bout de la rue.
On est invisibles ou quoi ?
Foutus yos à la con.
Kenard se fout de leurs gueules.
Tu veux attendre un échange ?
Et merde.
Ils ont les mains sales de toute façon.
Mains contre le mur, petits cons.
- On a rien fait.
- Sérieux, j'étais juste sur ma chaise,
en train de lire.
Et regarder tes gars vendre du matos,
tu veux dire ?
Connard !
Je vous embarque quand même
pour ça. Délit d'absentéisme.
- On est samedi.
- Perdu. Mercredi.
J'ai passé l'âge, moi.
Pourquoi vous m'arrêtez ?
- Colicio.
- C'est agent Colicchio, ducon.
Obligés de tout bloquer ?
La ferme. C'est une opération de police.
Retournez à vos postes.
Reculez ces véhicules.
- M'oblige pas à me répéter.
- Tony, calme-toi.
Pouvez-vous avancer un peu ?
Je vais juste au bout de la rue.
Je t'ai dit de la fermer !
Tu nous prends pour qui ?
On est la police !
Qu'est-ce que vous foutez ?
Lâchez-moi !

- Templeton
Bordel !
- Un problème ?
- J'ai passé la journée
à suivre ces 80 000 dollars
que Clay a retirés sur son compte,
pensant qu'ils étaient sales.
Mais il rembourse juste
un prêt de sa belle-mère.
Un prêt ?
Ça peut être que ça. Elle lui a donné
la même somme en 2002,
servant d'acompte la même semaine
pour l'achat d'un bien immobilier.
Tu vois ?
Une maison de campagne dans le comté
de Calvert, achetée il y a 6 ans.
Tu as la demande de prêt ?
Une seconde.
Voilà.
On le tient.
Le coup de grâce.
Quoi ?
Et si quelqu'un insinue
que j'ai outrepassé la hiérarchie,
agi dans votre dos, pris position
contre vous, ce quelqu'un ment.
J'ignore qui a dit ça au journal,
mais c'est un mensonge.
Sauf votre respect,
j'ignore d'où sortent ces conneries.
Personne ne m'a approché.
Ni Carcetti ni personne d'autre.
Mais si cela arrive,
je refuserai le poste
et dirai que je vous suis fidèle.
M. le Préfet ?
L'article sur les Preakness
ou sur le pompier mort ?
- C'est un entretien pour ?
- Un poste au service métro en Virginie.
Va pour le pompier.
Je l'ai écrit avant bouclage.
Burrell sûrement viré.
- D'où tu tiens ça ?
- Un appel.
Un sergent à l'Est dit
qu'on parle que de ça.
- Souhaite-moi bonne chance.
- Bonne chance.
La rumeur dit que Burrell se ferait
virer aujourd'hui, demain au pire.
- Au boulot, alors.
- Et Twigg ?
Avec les sources qu'il a.
Je peux pas lui donner
pour son dernier jour.
Fais de ton mieux.
Tu es désormais la chargée à la police.
Non réclamés.
Jusqu'ici, cette année... onze.
Treize, en comptant les deux
non identifiés encore au congélo.
Cherche ceux sans domicile fixe.
Jimmy, ça m'aiderait
de savoir ce que tu cherches.
Pour savoir
où on retrouve le plus de SDF morts.
Par surdose ou pas ?
- Ça a grimpé, avec le Fentanyl.
- Ajoute-les. Plus on est de fous...
Purée !
Tous morts et SDF ?
Ils tombent comme des mouches
dans le district Sud.
Lester, c'est moi.
Oui, à la morgue.
Il y en a de 16 h à minuit,
surtout la nuit,
et surtout à Baltimore Sud.
On connait qui en patrouille
de minuit à 8 h là-bas ?
23 h au district. Ça marche.
Jimmy, y a quelque chose
qui m'échappe ?
En quoi tout ça t'aide ?
Je veux pas un de ces bouquets
pour gangster bidon.
Il était de la vieille école.
J'ai l'impression de connaître Butchie,
mais je le remets pas.
Il a grimpé sous Teensy.
Une bastos lui a fait perdre la vue
prématurément.
Se mouillait parfois, sinon discret,
tel un chiot marchant sur du coton.
Celui-ci convient très bien.
Ajoute
"Butchie. Malheur à ceux
"qui appellent le mal bien,
et le bien mal."
Signe-le
"Ton fidèle et loyal ami,
"Proposition Joe."
Tu penses pas sérieusement
qu'un gentil mot
va empêcher Omar
de s'en prendre à nous.
C'est sincère. C'était un homme bien.
- Et Marlo ?
- Marlo, c'est Marlo.
C'est pas lui
qui m'a foutu dans ce merdier,
mais l'enculé
qui lui a chuchoté à l'oreille.
Je sais ce que tu penses,
mais pas touche à ma famille,
pas avant d'en savoir plus.
Et connaissant le fils de ma soeur,
si le petit a 50 plaques dans sa poche,
ça prendra pas longtemps
avant d'atterrir
entre des mains marchandes.
Et ce genre de mains, on connaît bien.
Entre-temps, si Omar
s'en prend à quelqu'un, ce sera à moi.
Et par respect pour ses divers talents,
je vais m'éclipser quelque temps
après la réunion de demain.
En attendant que cette merde se règle,
Cheese surveillera la boutique.
Et tu surveilleras Cheese.
Très propre. Très joli.
Mais ce n'est pas nécessaire.
Ce n'était pas notre intention
de vous induire en erreur.
Quand j'ai abordé
l'état de votre argent,
je parlais... symboliquement.
L'argent venait de la rue,
et donc je pensais
que vous veniez de la rue.
C'est le cas.
- J'en viens.
- C'est pas l'argent qui m'inquiétait.
Vous avez été plus que généreux,
et ceci est le cadeau
d'un homme honorable, manifestement.
Mais, en acceptant un tel cadeau,
nous vous donnerions
une impression erronée.
Vous venez de la rue.
Mais la rue, ça ne nous concerne pas.
On y connait quelqu'un
et on lui fait confiance.
Mais... faire connaissance
avec d'autres personnes,
apprendre d'autres noms,
qu'eux apprennent les nôtres...
Je suis pas là pour critiquer Prop Joe.
Mais des gens dépendent de moi.
Vous savez, l'année dernière,
il y a eu un vol.
Je veux dire, et si ça se reproduisait ?
- Mes gens, ils deviennent quoi ?
- C'est à vous de voir avec Joe.
Je demande juste une assurance.
Qui me couvre, moi
- et vous.
- Et qui couvre Joe.
Le jeune homme
n'a pas tort.
Tu as raison.
C'est une période instable.
Il n'est pas déraisonnable
d'avoir une assurance.
Qui sait ce que demain nous réserve ?
Tu peux y aller.
Sois prudent.
Votre mallette.
Vous venez de loin.
Pour vos dépenses.
Si nous lui disons non,
il reviendrait quand même.
Il nous a prouvé cela.
Mais ce n'est pas Joe.
Ce n'est pas Joe.
Si je vous suis bien,
la belle-mère du sénateur
lui a donné 80 000 dollars
qu'il a utilisés en tant qu'acompte
sur un bien immobilier.
Il l'a remboursée par la suite,
ce qui en fait un prêt.
Ce qui falsifie la demande de prêt.
Dès la signature de la demande,
il est exposé.
Titre XVIII du code des États-Unis,
chapitre 47,
section 10-14 :
demandes de prêt et de crédit.
30 ans et 1 million de dollars maximum.
Chez le procureur fédéral,
on appelle ça "le coup de grâce".
30 ans pour ce que fait tout étudiant
avec son premier logement.
Papa prête l'argent pour avoir droit
au prêt et se fait rembourser ensuite.
30 ans.
Avec un tel atout,
l'affaire doit passer au niveau fédéral.
Remarquable travail, inspecteur.
Laissez-moi le temps de digérer cela.
Maître, un instant ?
Y a-t-il un autre moyen de procéder ?
- Nos chefs d'accusation sont solides ?
- Nos preuves sont irréfutables.
4 chefs de vol, sûrs. Il a escroqué
ses propres oeuvres caritatives.
S'il est déclaré coupable,
c'est 10 ans par chef.
Ça reste conséquent,
même sans la fraude bancaire.
Vous croyez que je pourrais participer
à une de vos réunions de préparation ?
Les jours où on assure.
Ed ? Je te présente Scott Templeton.
- Enchanté.
- Ravi de vous rencontrer. Asseyez-vous.
Donnez-moi une minute.
La prochaine bouche à nourrir
est l'honorable révérend Isaac Cason.
Bon Dieu ! Je donne pas Ray Lewis
en pâture. Je veux juste jeter Burrell.
Pour que ma communauté accepte
Rawls, va falloir graisser des pattes.
Ce sera Rawls pour 6 mois,
ensuite Daniels.
Daniels est pas assez noir pour vous ?
Ils ne le connaissent pas.
Ils connaissent Burrell,
et ils l'ont au téléphone au besoin...
Burrell m'a refilé des stats truquées.
Il m'a menti.
Rawls aussi, mais vous le promouvez
préfet suppléant.
Juste le temps d'initier Daniels
comme adjoint.
On ne peut pas virer les deux, si ?
- Cela ne nous mène nulle part.
- Tommy, plus que deux.
Bien. Comment puis-je aider
ce bon révérend Cason ?
Il veut convertir son bien immobilier
sur Park Heights en maison de retraite.
- Solution ?
- On peut rediriger des fonds
du Développement urbain.
Il nous reste la révérende Myrtle Smith.
Elle veut agrandir le parking
de l'église sur une parcelle libre.
- Ça appartient à la ville.
- C'est tout ?
- Le dernier était facile.
- Bail à long terme,
un dollar par an.
N'oublions pas
les habitations sur McCulloh.
Celles qui sont adjacentes
à l'expansion d'Andy Krawczyk
de 300 millions de dollars
du complexe administratif fédéral ?
- Plus de 500.
- Logements sociaux.
Nerese, il vous faut
l'argent du plan Hope VI.
- Il reste de l'argent ?
- Cela importe peu, messieurs.
Mme la Présidente
ne réclame que notre feu vert.
Vous voulez qu'il parte, non ?
C'est bien.
Votre style est parfois un peu alambiqué
par rapport à ce que nous faisons ici,
au <i>Post</i>.
- Mais il y a de l'initiative.
- C'est le style
qu'ils veulent, mais à dire vrai,
je préfère l'écriture directe.
- Depuis longtemps à Baltimore ?
- Deux ans.
Avant, j'ai travaillé
au <i>Kansas City Star</i> pendant trois ans.
- <i>Wichita Eagle</i> avant ça.
- Le <i>Sun</i> est un bon journal.
Avant les restrictions, peut-être.
Ils nous battent souvent à Annapolis,
mon bureau du Maryland
les prend au sérieux.
Vous n'avez pas travaillé
sur ces histoires de redevance foncière
de l'an passé ?
C'était du bon travail, vraiment bon.
Vous vouliez aller à la réunion
de la première page ?
Une autre fois, peut-être.
Comme il vous l'a dit,
on garde le CV dans nos dossiers.
Quelques autres articles,
un peu de maturation, on y repensera.
Vous pouvez jeter ça.
Ce qui est prévu. Le laisser se faire
les dents comme adjoint aux opérations,
et dans 6 mois, lui donner le poste.
Il n'est pas aussi propre et lisse
qu'ils le pensent.
Il vient du district Est,
d'une brigade antidrogue pourrie
qui volait de l'argent saisi.
J'ai en fait dû...
Il ne s'agit pas de Daniels.
Vous avez montré des stats truquées.
Pour le maire, c'était le coup de trop.
Mes chiffres étaient corrects, revus
par mon personnel. Dites à Carcetti...
Ervin, ça n'a plus d'importance.
Vous êtes fini.
Carcetti vous a déjà oublié.
Dites-lui que s'il me dégage comme ça...
je me fais Daniels.
Vous flinguez Daniels, et on se retrouve
avec Bill Rawls comme préfet.
Les pasteurs, le caucus, le conseil,
ils s'accommoderont de Daniels.
Pourquoi ?
Parce que Carcetti leur cède
tout juste pour vous sortir.
- 30 pièces d'argent chacun, hein ?
- On va couvrir vos arrières.
Je vous le promets.
Une pension complète
et un poste au conseil de coordination
de la justice criminelle du maire.
Ensuite, quelque chose à Washington
avec une des associations de police.
Six chiffres garantis.
Si vous sortez comme il faut,
vous serez récompensé.
Si vous faites un scandale,
personne, ni le caucus, ni les pasteurs,
ni moi...
ne serons là pour vous.
À vous de voir.
Conférence de presse demain.
Jouez le jeu.
Carcetti en fera de même.
<i>Votre attention.
Tous les véhicules non autorisés</i>
<i>à stationner sur le quai de chargement
sont remorqués.</i>
- Personne n'en parle ?
- Je pensais que vous m'aideriez.
- Même officieusement ?
- Je cherche confirmation.
La 2e édition
va être bouclée. On en est où ?
Une source au tribunal le confirme,
elle le tient de Steintorf à la mairie.
Personne du bureau du maire ne parle,
mais conférence de presse demain.
- Que dit la direction ?
- Rien. Daniels ne commente pas
- et Rawls ne me rappelle pas.
- Merde,
merde, merde !
Et il fout quoi, Templeton ?
Il pourrait aussi passer des appels.
Mon dernier cadeau, Gus.
Stan ?
C'est Twigg, on va boucler,
alors droit au but. Tu vas pas me dire
qu'ils virent le préfet de police
ce soir et que t'es pas au courant.
Me raconte pas ça.
Heureusement me suis portée garante,
sinon c'était la maison de correction.
Regarde comment tu me traites.
Tu viens pas me voir,
tu me laisses pas voir Bug.
Tu remercies ainsi une mère ?
- Comment te remercier ?
- Commence par me montrer du respect.
C'est tout ?
En vérité, les temps sont durs
en ce moment.
Vu que tu t'en sors bien,
je me disais tu pourrais
m'en faire profiter.
Vu que j'étais là pour vous et tout.
Je te paye pas pour être ma mère.
Les pros de la centrale sont là.
- Que puis-je pour vous ?
- Tu as une copie du registre ?
Oscar a sa licence d'agent immobilier ?
C'est son boulot de jour.
Mon équipier de patrouille préféré
de mes vertes années. Merci.
Difficile de t'imaginer en patrouille.
- La mort, pour trouver.
- Pour ça qu'on appelle ça un trou.
C'est vraiment une idée de malade.
Tu le sais, j'espère ?
Je fais qu'orner ton plan parfait, fils.
Là.
Juste là.
Laissez-moi.
C'est ma pause.
Excusez-moi, M. l'agent.
C'est bien la bretelle d'accès à la 95 ?
Socks.
Putain de moi.
Voici mon coéquipier, Jimmy McNulty.
Tu as l'air d'un homme à la recherche
d'une maison. Réfléchis-y.
C'est un marché d'acheteurs.
- Jolie carte.
- Tu décèles
la qualité, Socks.
Appelle-moi si tu veux faire affaire.
- C'est pas une visite de courtoisie ?
- J'aurais préféré.
Viens-en au fait. J'ai une journée
chargée demain. Faut que je me repose.
Oscar, on a besoin d'un cadavre.
Homme, sans-abri,
le moins possible de décomposition.
Une mort sans témoins ?
Ça devrait pas poser de problèmes,
vu que t'es de la Crim.
On a besoin d'y être
avant que quelqu'un d'autre le voie.
Vous cherchez
une enquête pour meurtres ?
Ça doit être une première, celle-là.
Comment je vous contacte ?
Tu veux savoir pourquoi ?
C'est tout ?
- S'il décide de plus nous aider...
- McQuayle était de la Crim. Il a eu
un kidnapping raté.
Il se pointe et voit le chef de secteur
qui visite sa propre scène de crime.
Il lui demande de se retirer
en citant le règlement.
G-3 :
la direction et la responsabilité de
la coordination de l'enquête reviennent
à l'inspecteur de la Criminelle.
Le chef de secteur en prend ombrage.
Oscar ne recule pas
et on frôle le pugilat.
Le lendemain matin,
on l'accuse d'insubordination.
Il doit faire deux semaines en extra
à battre le pavé sur Monument Street.
Il leur dit d'aller se faire foutre.
Qu'il préfère passer en jugement.
Il se mange deux semaines,
puis ils le virent de la brigade.
Le chef de secteur ?
Il s'appelait Rawls
si j'ai bonne mémoire.
Pourquoi t'es encore en vie, yo ?
Ils voulaient envoyer un message.
Dis-lui.
Il a dit : "Dis à Omar qu'il a mis
sa main dans la mauvaise poche."
Et les gars de Marlo,
ils y sont pas allés mollo avec Butchie.
Je vais me les faire.
Doux Jésus, je vais me les faire.
- Je veux en être.
- Non. Que moi, yo.
Tu les connais pas.
Sans surprise, c'est Rawls,
et Daniels prêt à surgir.
Ils savaient pas
que j'avais posé ma candidature ?
- Je me sens insulté.
- Enfin le jour du grand blanc Rawls ?
Ça ne durera pas plus qu'un jour.
Daniels en fin d'année.
Regarde.
Tu vas même pas le lire ?
Tu y changes que la date.
- Je couvre mon derrière, Jay.
- Considère-le couvert.
Enculé, je suis responsable, pour
les 22 cadavres d'il y a plus d'un an
et j'ai toujours pas
les analyses d'empreintes de 14 scènes.
Le labo arrive pas à suivre les enquêtes
de cette année. Tu veux que ça bouge,
trouve de quoi me convaincre.
Ou un ensemble de chimie.
J'étudie le passé de mes victimes,
pour trouver des points communs.
Enculé, t'avise même pas...
Toi aussi, va te faire foutre, enculé.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il a, Bunk ?
- Difficile à dire.
Derrière son visage glacial
se cache un être très sensible.
Tu cherches le thème ?
Eh bien, encourage-moi.
Je vais tenter d'interroger
mon unique témoin.
L'effraction de domicile ?
- Tu l'emmerdes, Tony. C'est un connard.
- Il a vu ce que tu faisais.
Tu sais qui tu tabassais hier ?
Tu le sais, putain ?
Un professeur,
de l'école primaire Stuart Hill,
qui se rendait
à un programme périscolaire.
- Il aurait dû le dire.
- Il a pas eu le temps.
J'en ai vu, des conneries, mais même
pour le district Ouest, cela se classe
dans une nouvelle catégorie.
L'IGS est avec le commissaire.
Ils seront là dans 10 minutes
pour les dépositions.
Tony, tu vas devoir faire ça bien.
Les klaxons excessifs t'ont empêché
de mener l'arrestation des jeunes
qui se sont dispersés à cause du bruit.
- Et tu as prévenu le conducteur...
- Nique sa mère, à cet enculé.
Quoi ?
Nique sa mère.
Un merdeux klaxonne comme un veau,
il devrait être enfermé, cet ignorant.
<i>Lieutenant administratif,
pour le bureau du commissaire.</i>
Je fais un rapport.
Usage excessif de la force.
Conduite inappropriée.
- Tu me couvres pas ?
- Je t'inculpe.
Inculpe-moi.
Espèce de lâcheur de merde.
Alors, je suis un lâcheur.
Non. Après ce que j'ai fait
pour le balancer hors de l'avion,
vous voulez
que j'enjolive son parachute ?
Le préfet a servi la ville 34 ans.
Cinq de ces années
suffiraient pour l'inculper.
Vous auriez dû y penser avant d'avoir
pointé une arme sur moi et saisi
les habitations sur McCulloh pour
le promoteur caché sous votre jupe.
Ceci n'a rien à voir avec moi,
ni même avec Burrell.
C'est à propos de Daniels,
ou de celui que vous voulez promouvoir.
- Comment ça ?
- 34 ans, c'est beaucoup de temps.
Quiconque traîne tout ce temps
peut mettre la main sur de la saleté.
- S'il parle...
- Daniels ?
Je ne cite personne en particulier.
Je dis juste que pour le bien de tous,
Burrell doit s'en aller dans le calme.
Une conférence de presse
est prévue cet après-midi.
Je pense qu'Ervin
est prêt pour la poignée de main.
Avec vous, avec Rawls...
Par considération, il pourrait même
mettre son bras autour de Daniels.

Vous invoquez
votre droit de garder le silence ?
Évidemment.
Alors, ce témoignage est terminé.
Purée.
Et c'était qu'une tape amicale.
Imagine ce que ça aurait été
si on lui avait déballé toute l'affaire.
Le 5e amendement, hein ?
Quel est l'intérêt
du grand jury, alors ?
La réponse, inspecteur,
se trouve sur Calvert Street.
Sénateur, nous voudrions vous parler.
Avez-vous comparu
- devant le grand jury ?
- Jane, j'ai insisté pour être appelé.
Vous seriez la cible d'une enquête
pour vol et détournement de fonds.
Non. Pardon ? Non.
Certaines personnes sont dans le doute.
Je suis donc venu
pour remettre les choses en place.
Avec plaisir.
Je suis heureux de saisir l'occasion...
Le grand jury est censé être secret.
Qui a appelé les journalistes ?
M. Bond, notre procureur.
Il s'approprie le sénateur
avant qu'un autre le puisse.
Il semble y avoir un petit malentendu
sur certaines de mes affaires
au sein de la communauté.
Yo. Dès que ce journal
me laissera tranquille,
je me débarrasserai de mon club
et me faire un million.
Je vais récupérer
plein de maisons vacantes.
Voilà. Comme un vrai bonhomme.
C'est un monde nouveau.
Faut acheter des biens immobiliers
et attendre que les Blancs arrivent
- pour se faire un max.
- Milton le fait, sauf qu'il a une assos
avec le programme emploi des détenus.
- Des taulards réparent sa maison.
- Bande d'enculés...
fermez vos gueules.
Vous m'emmerdez.
On parle affaires. Sinon, on se casse.
Marlo semble pressé.
Vous pourrez continuer
après la réunion.
Pour finir, on a le Morfal.
Le petit s'est permis
de faire des incursions illégales
dans les territoires de County
donnés à mes gars.
"Incursions" ? Tu parles bien, dis-moi ?
Continue, ça va être la fessée.
Comme si t'avais le courage.
L'enculé pisse comme une pute.
Taisez-vous.
À ce que je sache,
t'es pas un des fondateurs.
Je m'excuse.
Mon neveu fera attention aux limites,
je t'assure.
Très bien. La séance est levée.
Putain, c'est quoi, ce bordel ?
Comme je te l'avais dit, hein ?
J'en ai retiré une partie
pour le ramener à la maison.
Je me disais.
Et après ?
Demain, si tu as le temps,
je t'ouvrirai la porte. Ça marche ?
Fils...
tu devrais te focaliser un peu plus
sur les avantages
de travailler en groupe.
C'est juste un avis.
Merci.
Venu voir un mort-vivant ?
Il paraît que Carcetti
va bien vous traiter.
Un salaire au conseil de coordination,
puis un poste à Washington.
- Vous le méritez.
- Bien sûr que je le mérite,
mais c'est pas par respect.
Ce que j'ai eu,
c'est pour avoir fait
le sale boulot toutes ces années.
Pour Carcetti, je suis une écharde.
Pour Royce, c'était pareil.
Je le suis peut-être.
Mais chaque jour,
les priorités étaient revues.
"Pourchassez les criminels."
"Non, plus maintenant.
"Occupez-vous du bien-être."
"Combattez le crime."
"Non, en fait, chassez les putes
de Patterson Park."
Vous croyez que le maire
dit aux écoles comment enseigner,
ou aux services de la santé ou éboueurs
comment faire leur boulot.
Mais une fois élus,
ils s'y connaissent
en travail de police.
Vous pouvez vous dire
que ce sera différent
une fois assis ici,
mais non.
Vous boufferez leur merde.
Daniels aussi, quand il arrivera ici.
<i>Comment on utilise l'échelle
pour monter ?</i>
<i>Comment on fait ?</i>
<i>C'est un superbe camion de pompiers.</i>
<i>Je me demande
où sont tous les pompiers.</i>
<i>Tu crois
qu'ils rentreraient là-dedans ?</i>
<i>Je me demande
quel type de sirène ça fait.</i>
Cheryl, salut.
Je me demandais si ça serait pas bien
que je passe voir Elijah.
Oui, je sais que ça fait un bail.
Mais...
Non, je peux me libérer.
Oui, demain serait parfait.
<i>Je reviens.</i>
Désolée.
- Je pense pas que...
- C'est pas grave.
Il est pas encore en état
de se remémorer les faits.
Comment se remettre
d'une chose pareille ?
Vous semblez nerveux, M. l'adjoint.
Je jure que je n'ai rien demandé.
Détendez-vous...
Vous m'avez dit une fois
que si je voulais vous griller,
vous le seriez déjà.
Merde, je me souviens même plus
du contenu du dossier.
Quelque chose à propos du district Est.
Y a si longtemps, qui s'en rappelle ?
Erv. Colonel.
J'aimerais dire quelques mots
sur le service public,
et sur Ervin H. Burrell.
Quand j'étais au conseil municipal,
Erv ne m'y était pas étranger.
<i>J'y présidais
le sous-comité à la sécurité.</i>
<i>Je l'ai sollicité maintes fois.</i>
<i>Nous travaillions étroitement,
et une fois maire,</i>
<i>nous formions une équipe solide...</i>
Il me craignait et me haïssait,
je l'aurais voulu mort.
<i>... pour en faire une ville plus sûre.</i>
Ne vous éloignez pas de l'Inner Harbor.
<i>Il faut un nouveau leader au conseil de
coordination de la justice criminelle...</i>
Ça a mis longtemps,
mais j'ai enfin mis son cul en pâture.
<i>Si vous voulez bien.</i>
<i>Merci. Voilà votre plaque.</i>
La plaque des échardes.
L'avantage
d'un maire d'une grande ville.
Combien de ces analyses
peut-on avoir dans l'article ?
Pas grand-chose.
Twigg était le gars idéal pour les
sources dans la police qui auraient chié
sur une telle mise en scène.
Et Price à la mairie ?
Ils ont organisé la conférence.
Ils diront jamais la vérité.
Un ancien flic est ce qui nous permet
de couvrir une telle histoire.
Putain, si on avait pas racheté
le nôtre...
Je comprends que vous soyez énervé
par les restrictions,
mais la civilité est importante.
- Je voulais évoquer votre vulgarité.
- Ma vulgarité ?
Une atmosphère collégiale
est essentielle.
Collégiale ?
J'ai raté l'école de journalisme.
Putain, ça veut dire quoi ?
Nom de Dieu, on couvre pas ça ?
<i>Les procureurs ne s'expriment pas
sur une possible enquête par grand jury,</i>
<i>mais des sources proches du dossier</i>
<i>disent que le sénateur
fait l'objet d'une enquête</i>
- <i>depuis plus d'un an.</i>
- Zorzi.
Clay Davis était devant le grand jury.
Il fait l'objet d'une enquête
depuis plus d'un an.
Je suis chargé aux affaires fédérales.
On a pas couvert d'affaires municipales
- depuis le départ de Doug Strock.
- C'est pas fédéral ?
Non, sinon je serais dessus.
Ça, c'est la ville.
Tu veux qu'un journaliste
couvre 2 tribunaux,
très bien.
Fous-moi aussi un balai dans le cul,
et je laverai le sol.
D'accord. Mettons-nous à jour, OK ?
Vois si tu peux avoir
une citation de Davis.
Tu travailles avec Zorzi.
- Ça marche. Il faut quoi ?
- Trouve le procureur.
Il a organisé une sortie médiatisée
pour Clay Davis, aujourd'hui.
Si on parle à Bond,
il nous mettra à jour.
Bon Dieu. Tu te rappelles
du bon vieux temps où personne
n'osait prévoir de sortie médiatisée
sans appeler un quotidien ?
De nos jours, tout ce qui les intéresse,
c'est une putain de vidéo.
- Ils sont oubliés.
- Je sais même pas pourquoi on fait ça.
Je pourrais sortir un rapport
durant mon sommeil.
Aucun risque que Jay lève son gros cul
pour venir vérifier ce que je fais.
Beaucoup repose là-dessus.
Bosse-la comme une vraie enquête,
ça semblera en être une.
Plus important encore,
ça se lira comme une vraie enquête.
T'aurais dû me voir à la Crim.
Tout le boulot éparpillé, comme perdu
dans l'affaire d'une carrière.
- Landsman a à peine remarqué.
- On amplifie ça,
Landsman n'est pas le seul
qui feuilletera ce dossier.
On s'assoupit,
on se fait prendre.
Que veux-tu que je fasse ?
Ce que les inspecteurs font, inspecteur.
Vous avez une seconde ?
Peut-être plus tard.
Je dois me préparer pour le boulot.
Votre chien mord ?
Il a des dents, non ?
Chip Change, va là-dedans. Voilà.
Je suis l'inspecteur McNulty,
Criminelle.
Je peux vous poser quelques questions ?
Une carte ?
Vous avez une carte ?
- Une carte ?
- Une carte de visite.
Ceci... Ça...
Ça, c'est une carte.
Vous savez quoi ?
On s'amuse déjà ?
J'ai besoin d'un verre.
Je te le demanderai qu'une fois :
où est Joe ?
Saute la discussion.
Fais comme tu le sens.
Joe a rien à voir avec...
Slim, je vais devoir te faire mal, yo.
Demande-toi, gros.
Pourquoi Joe donnerait Butchie ?
Si Marlo avait pu le faire parler,
il aurait mis Joe dans ta ligne de mire.
Si Joe avait balancé Butchie,
je te le dirais.
Merde, je t'aiderais même.
Mais c'est pas le cas.
{\a3}Vas-y, yo.
{\a3}Finis-en.
Regarde le cinquième paragraphe.
"Le maire,
"révolté par les résultats du préfet..."
- "Révolté", ça semble trop.
- Je sais pas.
Fiasco de la légalisation de la drogue,
les cadavres dans les maisons,
les stats bidonnées.
Je serais révolté.
Jay.
Regarde le 5e paragraphe d'Arnold.
"Révolté", c'est attiser la colère.
Ça évoque l'obsession.
C'est l'état d'esprit du maire ?
Une chose plus nuancée, peut-être.
Exaspéré, fâché, agacé...
plus convenable.
Mécontent.
Tu dissèques la chose.
Scott, c'était du bon travail,
par toi et Zorzi.
- Bel effort.
- Voilà des félicitations pour toi.
Comment ça s'est passé à Washington ?
C'est un marché d'acheteurs.
Service métro.
Le <i>Baltimore Sun</i> est pas si mauvais.
<i>9-Adam-4-3.</i>
<i>43.</i>
<i>Mort à l'arrivée signalée.</i>
<i>Ruelle à l'arrière
de l'ancienne usine de cuivre.</i>
<i>Bien reçu la MAA.</i>
9-46.
KGA, informez 43 que je suis tout près.
Je m'en occupe.
<i>Bien reçu, 9-Adam-46.</i>
<i>Oscar, tu es en forme ?</i>
- Cause toujours.
- <i>C'est "mort à l'arrivée", pas "cuvée".</i>
Je sais que vous kiffez la jouer secret,
mais merde, Chris,
votre trip façon CIA,
c'est un truc de ouf.
J'ai rien fait dernièrement
qui vous a vénère, pas vrai ?
Pas vrai ?
Le mec s'est déjà chié dessus,
alors qu'on a même pas
encore commencé.
Il est trop fort, yo.
Cadeau de Marlo.
Mais tu sais comment c'est.
Tu donnes un cadeau,
tu reçois un cadeau.
Yo, le Morfal, comment va ?
- Lester, tu peux faire demi-tour.
- <i>Pas bon ?</i>
- Oui, fausse alerte.
- <i>Entendu.</i>
Il est mort depuis trop longtemps.
Je les trouve.
Ce que tu en fais te regarde.
Merci. Peut-être la prochaine fois.
Vu que je te rends service, inspecteur,
tu peux écrire
le rapport du premier officier pour moi.
Mon code est A-1-15.
CABINETS
DE LEVY, WEINSTEIN & McHALE
Je le connais. L'avocat d'Avon.
Oui, le mien aussi.
Brick a recours à lui.
Comme Phil Boy
pour la plupart de ses trucs,
pas seulement le côté criminel.
Oui, Levy excelle pour faire tourner
notre argent de glandouilleurs.
Tu veux savoir quoi faire
de ces chèques de banque ?
C'est là qu'il faut aller.
Joseph, vous allez un air florissant.
Je fais aller.
M. Stanfield.
Joseph me dit de bonnes choses
à votre sujet.
Caméra retrouvée ?
Viré pour ça.
Allons dans la salle de conférence,
il y a plus de place.
Ceci est entre toi et ton avocat.
Carcetti jette enfin Burrell.
Ervin me précédait d'une année
à Dunbar.
Sans déc'.
Il faisait partie de la chorale.
Tu me tues. Je dois demander.
Abruti fini.
Elijah, dis bonjour à tata Kima.
Bref, tu tombes à point nommé.
J'ai des tas de choses à faire,
et je dois les faire
en plus de mes heures sup'.
Du boulot, hein ?
Ton chef a été viré,
on court à droite à gauche depuis.
Salut, Lij.
File. Ça ira.
C'est bien !
Tu ne dépasses pas les lignes.
Tu veux faire un truc ?
Aller au parc ?
Acheter une glace ?
Tu as dit quoi ?
Tu n'as pas de maison ?
Pas normal.
Un héros, il lui en faut une.
Ça fait longtemps
que j'en ai pas construit.
J'espère me souvenir.
{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\pos(70,135)}Préfet adjoint

- <i>Bill, c'est toi ?</i>
Non, c'est Daniels. Cedric Daniels.
- <i>Je cherche l'adjoint Rawls.</i>
- Il est dans le bureau du préfet.
- <i>Je peux le joindre là-bas ?</i>
- Oui.
<i>Bien. Merci.</i>
Il sait qu'il a merdé. Il le sait bien.
Mais il a sa fierté.
Il veut pas quémander.
Il s'agit pas de ça.
Sérieux, Carv.
Tu peux pas te faire un de tes gars.
Je sais que tu as du galon. T'es
presque lieutenant. Mais quand même.
S'agit pas du galon.
Je te l'ai jamais dit, Herc.
Jamais dit que dalle.
Mais quand je t'ai confié l'autre petit
à interroger l'année dernière...
Tu devais l'amener à Bunk Moreland.
Tu te rappelles ?
Oui. J'ai merdé. Et alors ?
Alors, ça a eu son importance.
C'est quoi, le rapport avec Colicchio ?
Tout a son importance.
Je sais qu'on pensait que non, mais...
c'est le cas.
Alors, faut
que tu te fasses Colicchio, hein ?
Tu dois penser
qu'ils ont eu raison pour moi.
Oui, sûrement.
Ces gars vont baver sur toi un moment.
Mais tu les emmerdes, Carv.
Tu fais ce qu'il y a à faire.
J'étais dehors.
Tu fais du 8 h - 16 h.
Je suis sur un tueur en série.
Toute mort suspecte, ils m'appellent.
Oui ? Où ça ?
Je vais pas mentir. J'ai pris
deux verres, puis j'ai reçu l'appel.
Je sais.
Je sens le Jameson d'ici.
- Jamie et Listerine, ta senteur.
- Beadie...
On avait quelque chose, Jimmy.
Entre toi et moi,
il y avait quelque chose.
Tu sais, quand les gens m'ont raconté
des histoires sur toi,
sur comment tu étais, je le croyais pas.
Je le voyais pas.
10 minutes.
J'en ai un autre. Baltimore Sud.
- Je cours après un tueur en série.
- Pas seulement.
Si tu veux pas rester ici...
Je dois y aller.
Il a changé ses habitudes.
Marlo est pas bête.
Il sait que tu vas t'en prendre à lui.
On dit que lui et Chris
dorment sur des matelas,
se déplacent quasiment chaque nuit.
Assez bête
pour réveiller chien qui dort.
- C'est révélateur, non ?
- Je sais qu'il m'attend.
Je vais pas aller sur lui direct.
Je vais m'en prendre aux siens.
Tu en blesses assez, le serpent
va sortir la tête de son trou.
Lui, là, Monk ? C'est son bras droit.
On va d'abord s'en prendre à lui.
Yo, note la gova, yo.
Oscar.
Lester.
- Merci, mon grand.
- À ton service, vieux.
Il est parfait.
Il doit être mort depuis moins de 2 h.
Mieux vaut jeter tout ça.
- T'es un tordu, McNulty.
- Blessures de défense.
C'est plus convaincant.
T'es gonflé de me traiter de tordu.
C'est toi qui as pensé aux dents.
Tu sais comment sont
ces enculés de psychos en série.
Ils mûrissent.
Ils commencent
de façon simple et sommaire,
puis ça devient de plus en plus orné.
Tiens.
Ne raconte jamais ça
à ma mère ou à mon prêtre.
Motus, promis.
- Tu veux que je te prenne ça ?
- Nan, c'est bon.
Pourquoi tu restes dans ce bouge ?
Avec toute la maille que t'as ?
Ton arrière-grand-père,
1er homme de couleur à être proprio
de sa maison à Johnson Square.
Ça représente quelque chose,
chose que vous avez perdue, les jeunes.
Oui, ben, on est dehors quand t'es prêt.
Ouvre l'oeil en mon absence, petit.
Charles dit qu'Omar est revenu.
Il a laissé Charles debout,
mais il sera peut-être moins enclin
s'il met la main sur toi ou les tiens.
Pas la peine de paniquer pour Omar.
Pas besoin.
T'es pas venu me dire au revoir.
Mon neveu.
Ce petit a toujours déçu.
Mais je t'ai traité tel un fils.
Le rôle de fils était pas pour moi.
- Mais mon assos... La bonne dope ?
- Les Grecs ?
Ça les gêne pas.
Proposition, alors :
je me mets à l'écart.
T'entends plus jamais parler de moi.
Je disparais.
Tu mijoterais un mauvais tour illico.
En vérité, tu pourrais pas
changer plus que moi.
Ferme les yeux.
Ça fera pas mal.
Voilà, c'est ça.
Joe, détends-toi.
Respire plus facilement.

Fuck is he doing?
Cops still parked
right up the block.
What are we, invisible?
Stupid fucking yos.
He's just fucking with 'em, man.
You want to wait for him
to serve somebody?
Fuck it.
They're dirty either way.
Hands on the wall, fuckers.
We ain't done nothing!
Seriously. I was just sitting
in my chair reading a magazine, is all.
Watching your crew
work a ground stash, you mean?
What the fuck?
Asshole!
Y'all still taking a charge
for this, you know that?
- You're a truant.
- Today's Saturday.
Try Wednesday.
Why you don't page truancy?
Why y'all locking me up?
Hey, Colicio.
Officer Colicchio, shitbird.
We need to block
every lane here?
Hey, shut it down.
It's a police operation.
Let's get back to your post.
Back these vehicles up.
- Officer.
- I'm not telling you again.
Tony, calm down.
Officer, if you could just move
your car forward Just a little bit,
I'm gonna get right down the road.
We're the police!
What are you doing?
Let me go!
Fuck!
- Problem?
- I spent all day
trying to trace this $80,000 withdrawal
from Clay's personal account...
Figuring it was dirty.
Turns out he's repaying a loan
from his mother-in-law.
A loan?
Has to be. I mean, she gives him
the same amount in 2002.
He uses it as a down payment on
a property that he buys the same week.
See?
He bought a weekend house down
in Calvert county 6 years ago.
You pulled the loan application
on the property, right?
Just a second.
Here you go.
Got him.
The head shot.
What?
And if anyone is suggesting
that I've broken chain of command,
That I've gone behind your back,
that I've lobbied against you
in any way, they're lying.
I don't know who told
the newspaper that,
but they were lying
when they said it.
Yeah.
Respectfully, sir,
I don't know where this shit
is coming from.
Sir...
no one has spoken to me--
Not Carcetti, not anyone.
But if I'm approached,
My answer will be
to decline the position
And say I serve
at your pleasure.
Sir?
Sir?
Go with the preakness piece
Or this one about the firefighter death?
- What are you interviewing for?
- Metro position, Virginia bureau.
Firefighter, I think. Got to show
something I wrote on deadline.
Burrell might get the axe today.
- Who told you that?
- Picked it up on my calls.
Desk Sergeant in the eastern
says it's all over the department.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
Got a rumor that Burrell is gonna
get fired today if not tomorrow.
Yeah?
- Work it.
- What about Twigg?
With his sources, you know?
I can't throw one at a guy
on his last day, can I?
You work it as best you can.
You are now
my new Senior cop reporter.
Unclaimed.
So far this year... 11.
13 if we add the two in the freezer
I ain't I.D.'ed yet.
Run it for no fixed address.
Jimmy, it'd help if I knew
what the fuck you were looking for.
Body wise, I just want to know where
we're pulling most of the homeless from.
With or without O.D.'s?
Numbers are way up
since Fentanyl showed up.
Throw them in.
The more, the merrier.
All right.
Damn!
They're all dead
and no fixed address?
Dropping like flies
in the southern lately.
Hey, Lester, it's me.
Yeah, in the morgue.
Some 4:00 to 12:00
with a lot of midnight,
And a lot of them
in south Baltimore.
So who do we know working
12:00 to 8:00 in the southern?
2300 in the district.
That'll work.
Jimmy, am I missing something here?
How does this help you?
Don't want none
of that phony gangster shit.
He was old-school.
Funny, I feel like
I should know Butchie,
But I can't place him.
Came up under teensy.
Caught him a slug early.
Took his sight.
Dabbled now and then, but kept it quiet
as a puppy walking on cotton.
This here do just fine.
Have it say,
"Butchie. Woe to them that
call evil good and good evil."
Sign it, "your true and loyal friend,
"Proposition Joe."
You ain't thinking no kindly note
gonna slow Omar coming at us.
It's how I feel.
He was a good man.
- And Marlo?
- Marlo is Marlo, man.
He weren't the one
that put me in this trick bag.
The motherfucker who snuggled up
and whispered in Marlo's ear did that.
I know what you thinking,
And I ain't making a move
against no kin,
Not till I got more to go on than words.
And knowing my sister's son
the way I do,
If the boy got 50 grand
in his pocket,
It ain't gonna be long
before it jump out and find itself
in some salesman hand.
And that kind of goody, we know.
In the meantime, if Omar coming
for any of us, He coming for me,
And out of respect
for that man's skill set,
I'm gonna take myself out
of the lineup after the meet tomorrow.
Till this shit sort itself out,
Cheese gonna watch the shop.
You gonna watch cheese.
Very clean. Very nice.
But this is unnecessary.
It was not our intent
to mislead.
When I spoke before
about the condition of your money,
I was lking... in symbols.
The money, it came from the street,
And so I thought
you came... from the street.
I did.
I do.
It was not the money
that concerned me.
You have been
more than generous,
and this is a gift
of an honorable man, clearly.
But, in accepting such a gift,
we would give you
the wrong impression.
You come from the street, hmm?
The street... doesn't concern us.
We know him down here,
and we trust him.
But... to know more people,
to learn more names,
to have them learn our names...
I'm not here to badmouth Prop Joe.
But people depend on me.
Now, last year,
there was a robbery.
I'm saying, you know, what?
What if this happens again?
Where do that put my people?
That's for you to discuss with Joe.
All I'm asking for
is an insurance policy.
You know, something covers me
- and covers you.
- And covers Joe.
The young man makes a point.
You're right.
These are volatile times.
It is not unreasonable
to carry insurance.
Who can say
what tomorrow will show us?
You go.
Be safe.
Your case.
Oh, y'all came a ways.
Put it to expenses.
If we were to tell him no,
he will still come back.
This he shows us.
But he is not Joe.
He is not Joe.
If I follow this,
the senator's mother-in-law
gave him $80,000
that he used as a down payment
on some property.
Later, he paid the money back,
which makes it a loan.
Which falsifies the loan application.
The moment he signs the application,
he's exposed.
Title XVIII of the U.S. Code,
chapter 47, section 10-14,
Loan and credit applications.
30 years
and not to exceed $1 million.
Over at the U.S. Attorney's office,
they call it "the head shot."
30 years for something
that every kid two years out of college
does with a starter home.
daddy loans you money to qualify;
a couple years later, you pay him back.
30 years.
With leverage like that,
this case needs to go federal.
Outstanding work, detective.
Let me have some time
to digest this.
Counselor,
a moment?
Is there another way to go at this?
- How strong are our theft counts?
- Straightforward document cases,
4 counts. They're a lock.
He stole from his own charities.
We convict,
that's 10 years per count.
Nothing to sneeze at,
even without the bank charge.
You think it might be,
OK for me to sit in
- on one of your budget meetings?
- On our good days.
Ed? This is Scott Templeton.
Good to meet you.
Have a seat.
Give me a second.
Next mouth needs fed
is the right reverend Isaac Cason.
You'd think I was putting
Ray Lewis out to pasture.
All I'm trying to do is dump Burrell.
You want my community to swallow Rawls,
you'd better grease that morsel up good.
It's Rawls for 6 months,
then it's Daniels.
What, you're gonna tell me Daniels
isn't black enough for you guys?
They don't know him.
They know Burrell, qnd they could
get him on the phone when--
Burrell came in here with bad stats.
He lied to my face.
Rawls lied, too, but you're bumping him
to acting commissioner.
Only till Daniels
gets groomed as deputy ops.
We can't fire everyone
all at once, can we?
This isn't getting us anywhere.
Only two more left.
Fine. How can I be of assistance
to the good reverend Cason?
He has property up in Park Heights.
He wants to convert it
to Senior housing.
- Can we accommodate him?
- We're broke, but,
We could steer
some of the hud money his way.
That leaves reverend Myrtle Smith.
She wants to extend parking
to a vacant lot next to her church.
- It's city property.
- That's it?
Last is the least.
We'll get the reverend
a long-Term lease, dollar a year.
Then there's the matter
of McCulloh homes.
That would be the same McCulloh homes
that's adjacent to Andy Krawczyk's
$300 million expansion
of the state office complex.
- It's over 500 units.
- Public housing.
Narrese, you're gonna need
that hope VI money for that.
- Is there any hope VI money to be had?
- It doesn't matter, gentlemen.
All madame president wants
from us is the green light.
You want him gone, right?
It's good stuff.
Some of your feature work
a little wrought
for what we do here
at the "Post" language-wise,
- But it all shows initiative.
- That's the style they want from me,
but to tell you the truth,
I prefer to write it dry.
- You've been in Baltimore long?
- Two years.
Before that, I was at
the "Kansas City Star" for 3 years,
"Wichita Eagle" before that.
The "Sun's" a fine paper.
Before the cutbacks, maybe.
Well, they still beat us
often enough in annapolis
for my Maryland desk
to take them seriously.
You have anything to do with
those ground red stories last year?
It's good stuff,
real good stuff.
You wanted to go
to the page one meeting, right?
Another time, maybe.
Anyway, as he says,
we'll keep the resume on file.
A few more clips,
a little more seasoning,
We'll take another look, OK?
You can just toss that.
That's the plan: to let him
cut his teeth as deputy for operations,
qnd in 6 months, make him.
He's not the spic-and-span boy
they think he is.
He came up in the eastern district,
part of a bad drug unit
that was skimming seized drug money.
I actually had to--
This isn't about Daniels.
You came in with bad stats,
And for the mayor,
that was the last straw.
My numbers were clean.
They had gone through staff review.
You tell Carcetti--
Ervin, it doesn't matter now.
You're done.
Carcetti has moved on you.
You tell him
if he does me like this,
I'll do Daniels.
You kill Daniels,
and we end up with Bill Rawls
as police commissioner.
The ministers, the caucus,
the council-- They'll live with Daniels.
Why?
Because Carcetti gave away
the store just to push you out.
30 pieces of silver each, huh?
We'll have your back.
I promise you.
Full pension
and a transitional job
on the mayor's criminal justice
coordinating council,
And from there,
something down in Washington
with one of the police associations--
6 figures guaranteed.
You go the right way,
and attention will be paid, Ervin.
But you go kicking and screaming,
and no one--
Not the caucus, not the ministers,
not me--
will be there for you.
Your choice.
Press conference tomorrow.
You play out the string.
Carcetti will do the same.
<i>Attention: all unauthorized
vehicles parked on the loading dock</i>
<i>are now being towed.</i>
<i>Attention: all unauthorized...</i>
No one's saying anything?
- I thought you might help me.
- Not even off the record?
- I just need to confirm.
- ...he told you.
E-Dot deadline's creeping up.
Where the hell are we at?
A source at the courthouse
says it's true
he heard it from Steintorf at the hall.
Nothing from the mayor's office,
but they've schedded a press conference.
- What's coming out of headquarters?
- Nothing. Daniels had no comment,
and Rawls won't return my calls.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
And where the hell is Templeton all day?
He could be throwing calls, too.
My last gift to you, Gus.
It's twigg, and I'm on a deadline,
so cut the bullshit.
Don't tell me they're firing
the police commissioner tonight
and you don't know all about it.
Don't be fucking telling me that.
Lucky I signed off on your ass,
or you'd be
on your way out to boys' village.
And look how you do me.
Not ming around,
not letting me see Bug.
- Is that how you pay back a mother?
- How should I pay you back?
Start by showing a little respect.
That all?
Truth is, things have been
rough around the way.
What you're doing's so good,
thought maybe
you'd throw some ends my way.
Seeing as how I was here for you
and all.
I ain't paying you to be my mother.
The pros from downtown are here.
- What can I do for you gents?
- You got a copy of the shift roster?
- Didn't Oscar get a realtor's license?
- That would be his day job.
My favorite side partner
from my salad days in patrol.
Thank you.
Hard to imagine you in patrol.
Damn if I can find it.
That's why they call it a hole.
That there is the sickest idea yet.
You know that, right?
I'm just gilding your lily, son.
There.
Right there.
- Go away! I'm on my lunch break.
- Excuse me, officer.
Is this the on-Ramp to 95?
Socks.
I'll be fucked.
This is my partner,
Jimmy McNulty.
You look like a man
in the market for a new house.
Think abouit.
It's a buyer's market.
Nice garden.
Ah, you have an eye
for quality, socks.
Call me if you decide to make a move.
So this isn't a social call?
I wish it were.
Well, get on with it.
I got a busy day tomorrow.
I need my rest.
Oscar, we're in need of a body--
Male, homeless,
little or no decomp.
Unattended death?
That shouldn't be no problem, Socks,
seeing as you homicide.
We need to get to it before anybody else
gets a look-- see.
You want to open an H-file?
Well, that's got to be a first.
How do I reach you?
- All right.
- All right.
You want to know why?
Is that it?
If he backs up on us--
Mcquayle was in homicide.
He caught one--
A botched kidnapping.
He gets there, finds the area
Chief sightseeing through his scene,
asks him to back off,
- cites the G.O.
- G-3:
authority and responsibility to
coordinate the investigation shall rest
with the homicide detective.
Area Chief takes umbrage.
Oscar stands his ground,
and there's quite a dust-up.
The next morning,
he's told he's insubordinate.
He's got to work two weeks extra duty
pounding pavement up Omonument street.
He told them to go fuck themselves,
you know, he'll take the trial board.
Well, he eats two weeks,
and they shitcan him out the unit.
Area Chief?
Name of Rawls,
as I remember it.
How you still alive, yo?
They needed to send a message.
Tell him.
Said, "tell Omar he put
his hand in the wrong pocket."
And you need to know,
Marlo dogs,
they didn't let Butchie go easy.
I'm gonna work them.
Sweet Jesus, I'm gonna work them.
- I want in.
- Nah, this one on me, yo.
But you don't know them people.
As expected, it's Rawls,
with Daniels waiting in the wings.
Did they not know that
I had made myself a candidate?
- I feel dissed.
- So the great white Rawls
- Filly has his day.
- Not much more than a day it shall be.
Daniels by year's end.
Look at this.
You're not even gonna read it?
All you do is change the date.
I'm covering my ass, Jay.
Consider it covered.
Motherfucker,
I am the primary
on 22 bodies more than a year old,
and I still haven't got
trace analysis on 14 scenes.
The lab can't keep up
with this year's cases.
You want action,
show me some traction.
Or buy yourself a chemistry set.
Just doing background on my vics,
Looking for a coon thread.
Motherfucker, don't even--
Fuck you, too, motherfucker.
- What's wrong with Bunk?
- Hard to say.
Beneath that gruff veneer,
he's actually very emotional.
Looking for the theme
in your homeless case, are you?
Well, wish me luck.
I'm gonna try for an interview
with my only wit.
The home invasion?
Fuck him, Tony. The guy was an asshole.
He saw what you've been doing.
You know who you were
beating on yesterday?
You fucking know?
A teacher,
from stuart hill elementary,
trying to get around our bullshit
to make it to an after-school program.
- He should have said so.
- He never got a chance.
Boy, I seen some stupid shit in my day,
but even by western standards,
this rates a whole new category.
I.I.D. Is down the hall
talking to the Major.
They're gonna be down here
looking for statements in 10 minutes.
Tony, you got to write this smart.
The excessive horn blowing
distracted you
from securing juvenile prisoners who...
became volatile due to the noise,
And you warned the driver
several times--
Fuck that motherfucker.
- Say what?
- I said, fuck him.
Shitbird lays on his horn,
he should be locked up.
Fuck his ignorant ass.
<i>Admin Lieutenant to the Major's office.</i>
<i>Admin lieutenant to the major's office.</i>
Tony, I'm writing you up.
- You ain't gonna back me?
- I'm charging you.
Then charge me.
You're a fucking rat.
Then I'm a rat.
No way. After what I've been through
to toss him out of the plane,
Now you want me to pretty up
the man's parachute?
The commissioner
has served this city for 34 years.
Any 5 of which would be enough
to have him indicted.
You should have thought about this
before you put a gun to my head
and snatched up the McCulloh homes
for whatever developer
- you're hiding in your skirt.
- This isn't about me,
and it isn't even about Burrell.
It's about Daniels or whoever you're
trying to empower in that department.
- How so?
- 34 years is a long time.
Anyone who hangs around that long
can put his hands on a lot of dirt.
- If he'd talk out of turn--
- Daniels?
I'm not being specific here.
I'm just making it clear
for everyone's sake
It would be better
if Burrell went quietly.
We've scheduled a press
conference for this afternoon.
I think Ervin is ready
for a little grip and grin.
With you, with Rawls...
for considerations, he might
even put his arm around Daniels.
Money from a donor
to west side hoops.
Deposit date.
Withdrawal from that account
to his personal account.
Again...
money from a donor.
Thank you for coming, Senator.
We've asked you in to answer
questions regarding certain
financial irregularities.
We can go to my office and talk first
or get right to it.
Lead on.
If you'll follow me, then.
He's pretty cool about it.
The coming out tells the tale.
Devon?
<i>Do you know this story?</i>
<i>Or would you like me
to read it to you?</i>
<i>Devon?</i>
Now, then, I show you a canceled check
dated 22 january, 2007,
from Sterner, Ernst,
and Bauer development group
made payable to west Baltimore
hoops, incorporated
in the amount of $11,000.
And this dated 23 january, 2007,
a check drawn on the west Baltimore
hoops, incorporated account
In the amount of $11,000.
And a deposit slip
dated 23 january, same year,
to your personal account
in the amount of $11,000.
I come here to help,
but y'all out for blood.
I'm not answering no more questions.
You are invoking your right
against self-Incrimination,
- sir?
- Damn right.
Then we'll conclude this testimony.
Damn.
And that was just a love tap.
Think what'd have happened if we hit
the good Senator with the whole shebang.
Work on the fifth, huh?
Why did we even grand jury, then?
The answer to at, detective,
is out on Calvert street.
Senator. Senator,
we'd like to talk to you.
Please, over here.
Senator, would you care
to make a statement?
Is it true that you appeared
before the grand jury?
Jane, I insisted that I be called.
It's our understanding that
you're the target of an investigation
- into theft and fraud.
- Nooo. Pardon. Nooo.
Some people are confused
about some things.
But that's why I came down here today,
to set them straight.
Happy to do it, too.
Happy to avail myself...
Grand jury's supposed to be secret.
- Who called the reporters?
- Mr. Bond, our state's attorney--
Laying claim to the Senator
before anybody else can.
There just seemed to be
a little bit of a misunderstanding
about some of my dealings
here in the community.
As soon as this newspaper
stink get off my ass,
I'm gonna unload my club
and clear a mil.
And I'm gonna snatch up every vacant
I can get my fat-ass fingers on.
There you go.
Like a real player.
It's a whole new world out there.
Buy you some property.
Hold onto it till
the white people show up,
- You make a killing.
- Milton's into that,
Except he got some kind of deal with
that bullshit prisoner entry program.
- Got convicts fixing up his house.
- Motherfuckers...
shut the fuck up.
I'm sick of listening to your shit.
Have we got business?
If we ain't, we gonna bounce.
Marlo here seems pressed for time.
So y'all can pick back up
on this after the meeting.
Last up.
- We got hungry man.
- Junior here
took it upon himself
to make unlawful incursions
into county territory
that was marked for my people.
Incursions?
Ain't you the articulate motherfucker?
Keep on talking, boy.
You gonna get spanked.
Like you got the heart.
Motherfucker piss like a bitch.
All right, shut it down.
Last I look,
you wasn't no charter member.
I apologize.
My nephew gonna heed
the boundaries, I assure you.
A'ight.
Meeting's adjourned.
What the fuck up in here?
Just like I told you, right?
I pulled some of it out,
brought it back home.
I was, uh--
I was thinking.
What next with this?
You clear some time tomorrow,
I'll open the door for you.
That work?
Son...
you need to focus a bit more on what
can be gained by working with people.
That's just a thought, now.
Yeah. Thanks.
Come to see a dead man walking?
I hear Carcetti's gonna do right by you.
Salary with the coordinating council,
then a D.C. job.
- You deserve it.
- Sure, I deserve it,
but not for doing the job.
What I got,
they gave me for carrying
their water all these years.
To Carcetti, I'm a hack.
Royce was no different.
Maybe I am.
But every day, they send over
a new priority.
Go after the bad guys.
No, change that.
Make quality-of-life cases.
Get on top of the murders.
On second thought,
run thewhores out of Patterson park.
You think the mayor
tells the schools how to teach kids,
or the health department
how to do its job,
or sanitation how to pick up trash?
But get elected, and suddenly,
they know police work.
You might think it'll be different
when you sit here,
but it won't.
You will eat their shit.
Daniels, too, when he gets here.
<i>I wonder how you get
the ladder to go up.</i>
<i>How do you do that?</i>
<i>This is a wonderful fire truck.</i>
<i>I wonder where all the firemen are.</i>
<i>Think they could fit in here?</i>
<i>I wonder what kind of siren
sound this makes.</i>
Cheryl, hey.
I was thinking I might want
to swing by and see Elijah, you know?
Yeah, I know it's been a while.
But...
No, no, no. I can get off.
Yeah, tomorrow'd be fine.
Yeah. Sure.
<i>I'll be right back.</i>
- I'm sorry. I just don't think--
- No, no. It's OK.
Right now, he's too withdrawn
to revisit the event.
How do you come back
from something like that?
You look nervous, deputy.
I swear I didn't ask for this.
Relax.
You once told me that if I was gonna do
you, you'd be done already. Remember?
Shit, I don't even remember
what was in that file.
Something about the eastern district.
So long ago, who can remember?
I wanted to say a few words
about public service
And about Ervin h. Burrell.
During my time on the city council,
Erv was no stranger to me.
<i>I chaired the public safety
subcommittee,</i>
<i>and I called upon him many times.</i>
<i>We worked closely together then,
and when I became Mayor,</i>
<i>we formed a strong relationship...</i>
he feared and hated me,
and I merely wanted him dead.
<i>... making Baltimore a safer city.</i>
Don't stray from the inner harbor.
<i>I know that the criminal justice
coordinating council need a new...</i>
it took a while, but I finally
put his ass out to pasture.
<i>If you would.</i>
<i>Thank you.
I have a plaque for you.</i>
Plaques for hacks.
Prerogative of any big-city Mayor.
How much of that insight and analysis
can we get in tomorrow's story?
Little to none.
Twigg was the man who could work
the department sources,
and they're the ones that would shit
all over a dog-and-pony show like that.
What about Price at the hall?
They set up the press conference.
They're not gonna tell the
truth, even on background.
A veteran in the cop shop is what
gets us over on a story like this,
and fuck if we didn't buy ours out.
Gus, I understand that you're
disappointed with the cutbacks,
But civility is important.
I've been meaning to talk to you
about your profanity.
My profanity?
A collegial atmosphere is essential.
Collegial?
I failed out of journalism school.
What the fuck do "collegial" mean?
Jesus Christ.
We don't have this?
<i>Prosecutors would not comment on
a possible grand jury investigation,</i>
but sources familiar with the case
<i>say the Senator
has been under investigation</i>
-<i> for more than a year</i>.
- Sorze.
Clay Davis was grand-juried today.
He's been under investigation
for almost a year.
I'm a federal court reporter, remember?
We haven't had daily city court covere
since Doug Strock
- took the buyout before last.
- This isn't a federal probe?
If it was, I would have had it
months ago. This is city.
You want one reporter
covering two courthouses,
fine. Why don't you
shove the broom up my ass,
and I'll sweep the floor.
All right. Just get caught up, OK?
Meanwhile, see if you can
get a quote from Davis.
You're chasing
a courthouse story with Sorze.
- No problem. What do you need?
- Find the state's attorney.
He set up a perp walk for Clay Davis
outside the grand jury today.
We get a hold of bond,
he'll catch us up on all this shit.
Jesus.
You remember in the good old days
when nobody
in their right mind
would stage a perp walk
without calling a daily newspaper?
Nowadays, all they care about
is a goddamn video.
They're forgotten.
I don't even know
why we're doing this.
I can knock out an office report
like this in my sleep.
There's no way Jay gets off his fat ass,
comes up to check what I'm doing.
A lot rides on this.
Work it like a real case,
it'll feel like a real case,
And more importantly,
it'll read like a real case.
You should have seen me
in the squad room today.
All the case work laid out
like I'm lost in a career case.
- Landsman barely noticed.
- We crank this up,
Landsman's not the only one who's
gonna be thumbing through this H-file.
We get sloppy, we get cuffed.
What do you want me to do?
What detectives do, detective.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Maybe later.
I got to get readyor work.
Does your dog bite?
Got teeth, don't he?
Chip change, get your ass in here.
That's it.
I'm detective McNulty,
Homicide.
May I ask you a few questions?
Got a card?
You got a card?
- Card?
- Business card, yeah.
I can't make no money like that...
This-- That.
That is a card.
We having fun yet?
I need a drink.
I'm gonna ask you once,
where Joe?
Skip past the talking.
Do what you feel.
Joe ain't had nothing to do with--
Now, Slim, you gonna make me
hurt you, yo.
Ask yourself, dog,
why would Joe give Butchie up?
If Marlo could make him talk,
he puts Joe inside your big score.
If Joe turned Butchie,
I'd tell you.
Shit, I help you, even.
But it just ain't like that.
Come on, yo.
Finish it.
Take a look at the fifth graph.
"The Mayor, comma, incensed by
the commissioner's performance..."
- "Incensed" seems over the top.
- I don't know.
Drug legalization fiasco,
the bodies in the vacants,
The bullshit stats.
I'd be incensed.
Take a look at Arnold's fifth graph.
OK.
"Incensed" is to inflame with wrath.
It speaks to obsession.
Is this the Mayor's state of mind?
Something more nuanced, perhaps.
Galled, vexed, annoyed...
safer still--Displeased.
You'd take the crab
out of crab soup.
Hey, Scott,
That was good work by you
and sorze catching us up.
- Great effort.
- There's an "attaboy" for you.
How'd it go in washington?
Eh, buyer's market out there.
Metro desk.
"Baltimore Sun" ain't so bad.
<i>9-Adam-4-3.</i>
<i>43.</i>
<i>Reported D.O.A. alley
in the rear of the old plant.</i>
<i>Copy d.O.A.</i>
9-46.
K-G-A,
Advise 43 I'm close by.
I'll handle it.
<i>Copy, 9-Adam-46.</i>
Bunk, are you feeling all right?
She said "D.O.A.," not "doughnut."
I know y'all into keeping
things on the hush-hush tip,
But, damn, Chris,
This C.I.A. shit off the hook.
I, uh...
I ain't done nothing lately
to piss you off, right?
Right?
Man already shit hisself,
And we ain't even get started t.
He's funky, yo.
It's a gift from Marlo.
But you know how that go.
Give a gift, get a gift.
Yo, hungry man, what's up?
Lester, you can turn around.
Yeah, false alarm.
- Won't work. He's too far gone.
- I find them, detective.
What you do after that
is your business.
Thanks. Maybe next time.
Seeing as how I'm doing you
a favor, detective,
You can write the first
officer's report for me.
My sequence is a-1-15.
I know him.
Avon's lawyer.
Yeah, mine, too.
Brick uses him.
So does Phil boy for most of his stuff,
not just the criminal side.
Yeah, Levy excels in putting
our limp-dick money to work.
You want to know what to do
with them bank checks?
This where you need to be.
Joseph, you're looking prosperous.
I get by.
Mr. Stanfield.
Joseph tells me
good things about you.
You ever find that camera?
Cost me the job.
So let's, go into the conference room
where we can spread out.
This between you
and your attorney.
Carcetti finally dumps Burrell.
Ervin was a year before me at dunbar.
No shit.
He was in the glee club.
You're killing me.
I got to ask.
Stone stupid.
Say hi to aunt Kima.
Anyways, you were
right on time with this.
I got a dozen things
I got to get done,
and I got to do them while
working overtime at the station.
Been busy, huh?
Your boss got fired,
and we've been running ever since.
Bye, Lij.
Go on. We'll be fine.
Wow, that's good.
You staying inside the lines.
Want to do something?
Go to the park?
Get some ice cream?
What did you say?
You don't have a house?
What's up with that?
A hero needs a house.
Been a long time
since I built a house.
Hope I remember how.
Deputy ops.
Nothis is Daniels.
Cedric Daniels.
He's now in the commiioner's office.
Yes.
He knows he fucked up.
He knows this.
He's proud, you know?
He doesn't want to beg.
It's not about that.
Come on, Carv.
You cannot do one of your own guys.
I know you got rank now.
You're damn near lieutenant.
But still...
It ain't about the rank.
I never told you, Herc.
Never said a fucking word.
But when I gave you that kid
to debrief last year,
what's-his-face?
You were supposed to get him
to Bunk Moreland. You remember that?
Yeah. I fucked up.
So what?
So it mattered.
So what the fuck does this
have to do with Colicchio?
It all matters.
I know we thought it didn't, but...
it does.
So you got to do Colicchio, huh?
Guess you think they had to do me.
Yeah, probably.
These guys are gonna talk shit
about you for a while.
But fuck 'em, Carv.
You do what needs done.
- I was out all morning.
- You worked 8:00 to 4:00.
I'm working a serial killer.
They call me on any suspicious death.
Yeah? Where'd they reach you?
Well, I'm not gonna lie.
I stopped, had a couple,
then I got the call.
I know. I can smell
the Jameson's from here.
- Jamie and listerine-- Your scent.
- Beadie...
- I'm just--
- We had something, Jimmy.
You and me,
we had something.
You know, when people told me
stories about you, about how you were,
I couldn't believe it.
I couldn't see it.
Yeah. 10 minutes.
I got another one.
South Baltimore.
- Beadie, I'm chasing a serial killer.
- Yeah. That's not all you're chasing.
Look. If you don't want to be here...
I got to go.
He changed up.
Marlo's no fool.
He know you be coming at him.
Word is, him and Chris
went to the mattresses,
on the move almost every night.
Fool enough to kick a sleeping dog.
- That should tell you something, no?
- While I got the boy waiting on me,
I ain't go at him straight up.
I go after his people, you feel me?
You hurt enough of them, that snake
gonna stick his head above that hole.
That one there?
He's a lieutenant.
We gonna go after him first.
Mark that ride, yo.
Oscar.
Lester.
- Thank you, baby.
- Yeah. Anytime, man.
He's perfect.
Can't be dead
more than a couple of hours.
Better lose these.
You're a twisted fuck, McNulty.
Defense wounds.
Help sell it.
You got a lot of nerve
calling me twisted.
You're the fella
that came up with the teeth.
You know how these psycho
serial motherfuckers are.
They mature.
They start simple and crude
And become more and more ornate.
There you are.
Don't ever tell my mother
or my priest you saw me do this.
Take it to my grave.
- Want me to take that?
- Nah, I got it.
What you see in this hole, man?
All the money you got?
Your great-grandfather,
First colored man to own
his own house in Johnson square.
That means something,
Something you young'uns lost.
Well, we outside when you ready.
Hey, keep sharp while I'm gone, boy.
Charles say Omar back,
and while he left Charles standing,
the man might feel less inclined
if he get the drop on you or yours.
Ain't got to fret none about Omar.
No need for that.
You ain't come to see me off.
My nephew.
Boy was always a disappointment.
But I treated you like a son.
I wasn't made to play the son.
But my supply--
The good dope?
The Greeks, they cool with it.
Proposition, then:
I just step out the way.
You never hear from me again.
I just disappear.
You'd be up into mischief in no time.
Truth is, you wouldn't be able
to change up any more than me.
Close your eyes.
It won't hurt none.
There. There, now.
Joe, relax.
Breathe easy.

Joe sera regretté. Beaucoup.
On aimait bien Joe.
Difficile de ne pas l'aimer.
Le lendemain est assuré à personne.
Pendant ce temps-là, on continue.
Les affaires, la vie...
Ce qu'on apprend à apprécier le plus,
c'est une personne fiable.
Chaque jour qui se suit.
J'ai beaucoup appris par Joe.
On traite qu'avec toi ou ton second.
Personne d'autre.
Personne d'autre ne sait nos noms.
Personne d'autre ne nous contacte.
Compris ?
Pour nous contacter, utilise ça...
seulement.
Je parle pas sur les portables.
Là. Pour déjeuner, tu peux appeler.
Pour ta copine, tu peux parler.
Même ton avocat, tu peux.
La loi dit que ça reste
entre toi et ton avocat.
D'accord ?
Pour savoir quel film passe au ciné,
tu peux parler.
Tout ça, c'est bien, car ça leur montre
qu'il n'y a rien d'important.
Mais pour les affaires,
ne parle pas au téléphone. Jamais.
Entendu.
Joe me l'a appris.
Mais...
Comment...
Comment ça a été ?
Il a surmonté son deuil.
Tu la sens pas maintenant,
la couronne ?
Non ?
Car, moi, j'en porte une.
On devrait fêter ça.
Atlantic City.
On peut pas en ce moment.
Omar va se bouger. C'est sûr.
Yo, je dois passer chez moi.
- Ça te gêne ?
- J'aime bien ta famille.
Je dois leur dire que je vais
être absent pour un moment.
Tu as fait ton coup.
À mon tour maintenant.

{\c&HFFFFFF&}<b>REACT QUOTES</b>
{\c&HFFFFFF&}"Même s'ils sont à la rue,
ils ont des opinions." - Haynes
- Quatre, au moins.
- <i>C'est noté.</i>
On ressort d'anciens dossiers,
ça pourrait être plus.
<i>Quoi d'autre ?</i>
Et le mobile s'avère être sexuel.
Comment ça, sexuel ?
Quelqu'un sodomise les SDF ?
<i>Je peux pas détailler.</i>
Comment faire sans détailler ?
Dites seulement que ses compulsions
sexuelles le poussent à agir.
Les détails doivent
rester dans nos dossiers.
<i>Je sais pas. La dernière fois,
je n'ai pu obtenir la une de Métro.</i>
<i>Je vais voir avec mon service
et je vous rappelle. D'accord ?</i>
Des nouvelles de chez les flics ?
Des suivis sur les meurtres récents.
Une arrestation,
pour l'agression conjugale à Hampden.
Pas d'arrestation pour deux meurtres
liés à la drogue à Baltimore Est.
Donne-moi un résumé.
Pour l'agression, Patricia Boggus,
trouvée dans sa voiture.
Pour la drogue, Joseph Stewart,
trouvé dans sa salle à manger,
et Nathaniel Manns,
trouvé dans une allée de garage.
Deux paragraphes sur chaque.
Écris ça en une seule brève.
J'ai aussi des infos
sur un autre meurtre de SDF.
L'inspecteur dit que c'est lié.
Que c'est sexuel.
Sexuel ?
- Violés ?
- Il veut pas confirmer.
Il se contente de dire que les meurtres
sont de nature sexuelle.
Écris ce que tu as.
Je le soumettrai à 4 h,
voir s'il est pris.
Cette mise en examen
est le résultat d'une enquête de 18 mois
par le cabinet du procureur de l'État
et la police de Baltimore.
Cela met en relief un point central pour
tout représentant du gouvernement :
la confiance publique
des fonctionnaires.
Le sénateur Davis
a abusé de cette confiance.
Il s'est servi de son pouvoir
et son influence pour utiliser
les affaires locales
et les donateurs de campagne
en tant que distributeur
de billets.
Il a créé un réseau
d'organisations caritatives
et non lucratives
dont le but était de cumuler
de l'argent liquide
pour son propre intérêt, trahissant...
Ronnie Pearlman ?
Bill Zorzi, chargé aux affaires
fédérales pour le <i>Sun</i>.
Comment allez-vous ?
Sans vouloir paraître grincheux
en votre jour spécial,
mais depuis quand le procureur
de cette ville
arrange une sortie médiatisée
sans appeler le journal ?
On a appelé Gail Gibson.
Elle a un message sur son répondeur.
Gail est pigiste depuis 4 mois.
Son répondeur marche toujours.
Qui la remplace au niveau municipal ?
Dorénavant...
Simplement, ne me refaites jamais ça.
Il doit être tenu responsable
de ses actions frauduleuses.
Le sénateur Davis
a ouvert notre corps législatif
<i>aux persuasions monétaires.</i>
<i>Il a effectué cela sciemment
et au mépris total</i>
<i>de la fonction qu'il représente.</i>
- <i>Ce genre d'irrégularités...</i>
- C'est comment, Clay ?
C'est pas la fête, n'est-ce pas ?
Tu l'avais dit, Norman.
Il y a la petite arnaque
et la grosse arnaque.
Tu dois faire une déclaration.
Pas trop réjouissante.
Il ne faut pas danser sur sa tombe
avant d'être sûr qu'il soit mort.
Clay s'en relèvera pas.
Puis, il vaut mieux pas énerver
ses partisans, en jubilant trop.
Ce gars a encore des partisans ?
Après avoir créé tout ce merdier ?
Je vais te dire. Ce type, là,
a vachement la stature d'un maire.
Plus que Nerese, c'est certain.
Avec l'image que cela lui donne,
je dirais que M. Bond
a une longueur d'avance.
<i>... demeure à la cour commune.</i>
<i>Le sénateur Davis</i>
<i>aura à s'expliquer sur cet argent.</i>
- Tu lui as dit quoi ?
- Voyage d'affaires.
Pas là pendant deux semaines.
Ça devrait pas être plus.
Vaut mieux pas.
Mlle Trainor dit qu'on devra
apprendre un problème
chaque jour jusqu'à l'année prochaine.
Mémoriser, c'est ça ?
Par coeur.
Apprendre la question et la réponse.
Car ce sera les questions du test
l'année prochaine. Elle vous l'a dit ?
Mlle Trainor dit que si les résultats
sont pas meilleurs avant la sélection,
tous les profs seront renvoyés.
Sélection ? C'est quoi, ça ?
Quand les gens votent pour quelqu'un.
L'élection, tu veux dire ?
Tu te crois supérieur.
Pourquoi tu fais ça ?
- Dukie va chialer.
- Ça va pas ?
Que dalle !
Je suis là et je bosse.
Toi, t'es dans une baraque
à faire la pute de Mike.
- Il se prend pour qui, cet enculé ?
- Il a baffé le petit.
Et enfin, 6 feuillets sur Bud Selig
et la réponse tiède du baseball
sur les dernières recommandations
d'emploi des stéroïdes. En résumé,
Bud est génial selon les dirigeants,
le syndicat reste muet, Bonds
a le record de coups de circuit
- et tous disent que ça passera.
- Y a de l'info là-dedans ?
Que voudrais-tu en une ?
La mise en examen de Clay Davis,
les séances du congrès sur l'Iraq,
l'article de Price sur la campagne
solide de Carcetti pour le gouvernorat
et le film de John Waters
de nouveau à Baltimore,
si la photo est bien.
On en a une sur le tournage
où il pose avec des enfants acteurs.
C'est autorisé ?
Ne confondons pas l'auteur et son art.
- Autre chose ?
- Ceci est récent,
mais on a cette affaire à propos
d'un autre homme sans-abri assassiné.
- On pourrait le mettre en avant.
- Il y a eu d'autres meurtres ?
On a fait un petit article il y a
une semaine sur de possibles liens
entre 3 enquêtes. Dans Métro.
Le mobile serait sexuel,
mais les flics restent flous
sur la signification.
On pourrait le mettre en intérieures,
mais il faudrait investiguer davantage,
voir ce que ça donne.
C'est trop vague pour la une.
OK, on se revoit dans deux heures.
Je te l'ai dit, Duke.
Je les nique, t'as qu'à me dire.
Non, mec. Tu vas pas
intervenir tout le temps pour moi.
Va lui parler.
Il t'aidera.
Yo, M. Dennis.
J'ai besoin d'entraînement.
Voyons ça.
Il s'est passé quoi ?
C'est rien. J'en ai juste un peu marre.
D'accord, fiston. Mets des gants,
on va voir ce que tu vaux.
C'est très direct.
Je suis étonné que vos avocats
aient demandé des ajournements.
Peut-être parce qu'on payait à l'heure.
En tout cas,
votre dossier est très chargé.
Voiture sous une façade,
arme dans une boîte cachée.
La femme à qui elle appartient,
elle peut pas être condamnée.
Juste un prête-nom.
Trouvez quelqu'un.
Sans antécédents et de confiance
pour qu'il endosse la charge.
Je suis aussi venu avec ça.
Plus d'argent propre.
Quand vous saurez quoi en faire,
prévenez-moi.
Comment ?
410
915
0909.
Autre chose ?
Arrêtez le compteur.
Cette putain de racaille m'énerve.
Sois généreux.
Je sens que cette firme
va toucher une bonne paye
de la part de M. Stanfield et les siens.
Il m'a donné son numéro.
Si Marlo Stanfield utilise un portable,
ce n'est qu'une question de temps
avant d'être submergés
d'audiences préliminaires,
plaidant dans une affaire
d'écoute téléphonique.
Joe nous l'a amené juste à temps.
Et maintenant ?
Tu es obligé d'attribuer ça ?
5e paragraphe,
la proposition subordonnée.
À propos
d'un "modèle de trafic d'influence
répandu pendant des années."
La mise en examen le montre ou pas.
En plus, trois paragraphes d'affilée
commencent par un gérondif.
Comment tu veux que j'écrive
si t'es dans mes pattes ?
Laisse-moi au moins finir
avant de te jeter dessus.
Bien joué, Zorz.
Ils veulent davantage d'investigation,
mais je vois pas où je peux aller.
Les flics disent
que le mobile est sexuel,
mais ils veulent pas en dire plus.
T'as affaire avec qui ?
L'inspecteur qui mène l'enquête.
Et il cherche de la pub ?
Je savais pas si t'allais revenir.
T'étais parti avec beaucoup d'argent.
C'était pas pour l'argent, vieux.
Ça a jamais été pour ça.
C'est lui ?
Je vois que le Monk
préfère vivre en appart.
Trop bon pour les maisons identiques.
Et il a des gros bras avec lui.
Ils doivent
s'attendre à ce que tu attaques.
Et me voilà.
Tiens donc.
Merci de me rencontrer à nouveau.
Voici Scott Templeton.
Il travaillera avec moi là-dessus.
J'ai pas envie que tout votre journal
connaisse mon nom.
- Je sais.
- Ces affaires de SDF, vous voulez
qu'on y prête attention, non ?
Vous êtes là pour ça.
C'est un prédateur. Ça doit se savoir.
Exact.
Et apparemment, certaines choses
doivent rester secrètes
pour élucider l'affaire. Je comprends.
On peut pas en faire grand-chose,
à moins d'y mettre du piment.
- Du piment ?
- Les gens doivent savoir
pourquoi il fait ça.
Il faut rendre ça vivant
ou ils enterreront l'histoire
comme la fois passée.
Je vous l'ai dit, c'est sexuel.
Compulsion, obsession, dans ce genre.
Mais ça signifie quoi, putain ?
Il ne mutile pas des ménagères
ni n'étrangle des étudiantes.
Votre gars tue des hommes sans-abri.
Qu'est-ce qui lui fait faire ça ?
Il les viole ? Les sodomise ?
J'ai du sperme pour aucun cas.
J'ai pas ça.
Mais il fait un truc ?
Il leur attache un ruban rouge
autour du bras.
- Un ruban rouge ?
- Oui, un noeud.
Il emballe les pauvres bougres.
Assez pimenté pour vous ?
Oui, un peu tordu.
Mais personne ne tue
pour mettre un ruban autour d'un bras.
Peut-on dire qu'ils ont été abusés ?
Est-ce correct de dire ça ?
- On garde ça, donc.
- Ça ne vient pas de moi.
- Une autre.
- Quoi d'autre ?
Vous voulez que l'histoire s'ébruite,
donnez-nous davantage.
Gardez ce qu'il faut,
mais donnez-nous du piquant.
Un tueur en série suffit pas ?
Monde froid, je sais.
- Il a commencé à les mordre.
- Quoi ?
Il mord ses victimes.
Intérieur de la cuisse,
fesse droite, téton gauche.
- Il mord, quoi.
- Putain. Merde.
Assez piquant pour vous ?
On parle de cannibalisme ?
Que des morsures pour l'instant.
On verra comment ça évolue.
Il les a tous mordus ?
Pas tous.
Que les derniers.
- Il murit.
- Murit ?
Terme technique,
quand un tueur en série
devient plus obsessif.
Il développe un mode opératoire
élaboré, par rapport aux corps.
C'est assez dingue.
- Des morsures. Génial.
- Que mon nom n'apparaisse pas.
Pour la note.
On resterait bien, mais on a le temps
pour la seconde édition.
Merci.
Tu crois qu'en apprenant à te battre,
les gens vont te laisser tranquille ?
Le truc,
c'est que même en sachant te battre,
les gens te feront autant chier.
C'est pas comme dans les films
où tu tabasses une brute
et les autres se cassent direct.
Dis-moi,
pourquoi tu crois
qu'ils s'en sont pris à toi au départ ?
Je veux dire, pourquoi toi ?
Tout ce que je sais...
se trouve là.
Rien d'autre m'intéressait.
Je savais me battre.
Fut un temps, je savais
faire tourner les coins de rue.
Pas grand-chose d'autre
à part ça, franchement.
J'ai été à un coin de rue, un moment...
Et ?
Ce que je veux dire,
c'est que tout se résume pas
à l'image que tu montres dans la rue.
Ça se résume à ça
si tu traînes dans la rue.
Mais c'est pas la seule façon d'être.
Ici, si.
Ici, si.
Le monde est plus grand que ça.
Enfin, c'est ce qu'on m'a dit.
Mais comment aller d'ici
vers le reste du monde ?
J'aimerais le savoir.
Michael a grandi vite.
Oui, en effet.
Bref, pour un tel petit,
mon seul plan pourrait suffire,
tu vois ?
Ça pourrait marcher pour un tel garçon.
Mais un petit qui vient me voir
avec d'autres aptitudes,
d'autres façons d'être,
j'ai que de l'espoir et des souhaits.
C'est déjà ça.
J'aimerais qu'il y ait plus, fiston.
Ouais...
<i>Mobile sexuel
dans les meurtres de sans-abri</i>
Bien joué, fille.
Alma, tu t'occupes de l'enquête.
Tout ce qu'il y a de nouveau.
Je pensais travailler sur les victimes,
dresser un portrait d'eux.
C'est une bonne idée, mais j'ai déjà
chargé Fletcher de le faire il y a 1 h.
Il me reste quoi ?
Tu peux aller parler aux SDF.
Des déclarations de SDF ?
Même s'ils sont à la rue,
ils ont des opinions.
Où je vais trouver des SDF ?
Pas à la maison, j'imagine.
Filez, mes enfants.
Lis et pleure.
J'ai déjà lu.
Ainsi que le commissaire.
Ainsi que le colonel.
Ainsi que notre préfét adjoint
nouvellement baptisé.
- L'adjoint est la mairie.
- Ça a été rapide.
Un putain de journaleux
a beau gober tes couillonnades,
c'est pas le cas de tout le monde.
5 contre 10
que l'adjoint est en train
de les ramener sur terre.
Ce malade les viole ?
Je n'ai pas encore parlé
aux enquêteurs en détail,
mais les rapports n'indiquent
aucune pénétration ni éjaculation.
Que peut-on dire de nos actions ?
Nous avons de bons éléments dessus.
Il serait mieux de pouvoir
- les faire travailler sans relâche.
- Heures supplémentaires ?
Si vous pouviez les autoriser
pour cette enquête.
Accordé. Illimitées,
pour deux inspecteurs.
Tout ce dont ils ont besoin.
Une telle affaire,
où on essaie d'éviter d'autres meurtres,
demandera plus de deux inspecteurs.
Le président du CA des établissements
scolaires est à deux doigts
de licencier 50 professeurs de collège
et d'arrêter l'enseignement
pour handicapés en primaire
en violation d'un décret
de consentement fédéral.
Si bien que si j'ai plus de 2 dollars,
ils ne seront pas pour vous.
Faire avec,
c'est un des fardeaux
du commandement.
Pouvez-vous faire quelque chose
pour protéger davantage les SDF ?
On peut dire aux patrouilles
de répandre l'alerte, tenter
de les convaincre d'aller dans
les refuges une fois la nuit tombée.
Des unités surveillant
les lieux de réunion des SDF,
c'est possible ?
Et répondre aux appels ?
Pas sans doubler
les unités, ce qui signifie
heures supplémentaires.
Et rebelote.
Le sang dans nos veines.
Plus les jours passent,
plus tu fais chef.
- Va te faire foutre.
- C'était pas méchant.
- Si.
- Oui, c'est vrai.
C'est quoi ?
Un cadeau de ton seul vrai coéquipier.
Numéro de portable, Marlo Stanfield.
Ni vu ni connu.
Comme avec les mecs qui sucent
dans l'armée.
Quoi que j'aie pu faire qui t'a énervé,
n'oublie pas que j'ai aussi fait ça.
Et, Carv, quand tu lui mettras
les pinces, à cette chiennasse,
rappelle-lui ma putain de caméra.
Vous pouvez leur dire, à tous,
Royce, le caucus,
toutes ces putes cupides
qu'on a placées dans toute la ville,
vous pouvez leur dire jusqu'au dernier
que je ne tomberai pas tout seul.
Croyez que je vais servir
de bouc émissaire ?
Putaiiiiiiiiin !
Clarence va vous soutenir.
Il me l'a dit. Il se montrera.
Facile pour lui.
Il a aucune élection en vue.
Je ne vous vois pas avec les vôtres
à mes côtés.
Tout un tas de gens croit
devoir opter pour la neutralité.
- C'est comme ça.
- Vaut mieux pas pour vous.
Ou ça ira plus loin que Clay Davis.
Réfléchissez un instant
à ce que vous dites là.
Vous pouvez vous lamenter, baver
tout un tas de trucs à un procureur.
Vous savez où vous serez ?
Laissé en plan.
Aucune relation, aucun allié,
nulle part où accrocher votre chapeau
dans cette ville.
Ou vous encaissez pour nous tous.
Aussi longtemps que vous le pouvez.
Et si le pire arrive,
s'ils prennent votre siège,
si vous êtes enfermé un an
dans une colonie de vacances
à sécurité minimale, et alors ?
Vous retrouverez une ville
qui aura retenu votre nom.
Regardez Burrell.
Il s'en va discrètement. Il se fait
12 fois plus par an
qu'en tant que préfet.
En travaillant moitié moins.
Vous croyez que ça serait arrivé
s'il avait fait du foin ?
Les procureurs, ça va, ça vient.
Mais victoire ou pas,
vous serez de retour
avant même qu'on s'en rende compte.
N'est-ce pas, sénateur Davis ?
Je trouve un autre à emporter ?
Un endroit plus près ?
T'aimes pas cette bouffe ?
J'aime pas comment ces enculés
de chinetoques se tiennent parfois,
comment ils me matent.
T'inquiète.
Chris est avec toi ?
Derrière moi.
- Qu'est-ce t'as mis ?
- Quoi ?
Tu veux que ce dèpe sache
qu'on l'attend ?
Je suis juste prudent.
Si je vois le gilet,
tu crois qu'il peut pas le voir ?
C'est moi qui sers d'appât.
- Je suis le seul qui se cache pas.
- C'est pas grave.
Car, quand Omar va t'attaquer,
il va viser ta tête.
C'est ce que je ferais.
Sont restés en bas de chez Monk
toute la nuit, mais ont taillé à l'aube.
Ils reviendront, sûr.
Vous entendez beaucoup d'inquiétude
concernant ces meurtres ?
Je n'ai entendu personne en parler.
La plupart des gens que nous servons
ne sont pas vraiment sans-abri.
La plupart sont
des travailleurs pauvres.
Donc, la plupart de ceux
à qui j'ai parlé ne sont pas...
Sans-abri ? Non.
Certains ? Possible.
- Pourquoi ne pas...
- Vous sembliez progresser.
Je ne voulais pas tout gâcher.
Où me conseillez-vous d'aller, alors ?
Dans les rues, peut-être.
Le journaliste que le <i>Sun</i> a envoyé ?
Pas vraiment Bob Woodward.
Sacré bon travail, Bubs.
Mais on a besoin d'aide demain
pour servir dans la salle du fond.
Si ça te plaît pas,
je redemanderai plus.
Faut le tenir des deux mains, tu vois ?
T'essayes d'atteindre ta cible.
C'est pas comme dans les films.
Ça le fait pas.
OK, alors, écarte les jambes.
Le premier truc à faire ?
Mettre une bastos dans la chambre.
Comme ça. Regarde.
Vas-y.
C'est pas facile.
Dans ce cas,
essaie celui-ci.
C'est un outil, comme une clé anglaise,
c'est tout, OK ?
Le bruit que ça fait !
Pourquoi tu veux faire ça, déjà ?
Tu t'imagines quoi, Duke ?
Que si t'en as un,
personne va te chercher ?
Y aura toujours quelqu'un
pour te chercher.
Et s'ils savent que t'en as un,
ils te forceront à sortir avec.
Et tu devras alors
être prêt à aller jusqu'au bout.
Tu peux pas l'amener
si t'es pas prêt à l'utiliser.
Et sans hésiter.
Purée. Je sais pas tirer.
Je sais pas me battre. Je peux
même pas rester au coin de la rue.
T'as d'autres compétences, mec.
T'en as dans la cervelle.
Je sais pas, Bunk. On peut pas croire
tout ce qu'on lit de nos jours.
Eh bien, mon petit fouteur de merde.
Pour ce qui est de ta demande
d'hommes et d'heures en plus,
des heures supplémentaires illimitées
ont été agréées
pour l'enquête sur les meurtres
d'hommes sans-abri, pour toi
et un seul autre inspecteur.
Et les équipes de surveillance ?
Il faut surveiller certains endroits
et les schnoufards.
Deux inspecteurs uniquement.
Toi et l'exemplaire inspectrice Greggs
êtes ce qui a été autorisé.
Rien au-delà.
Putain ? Je suis sur un tueur en série.
C'est une affaire majeure.
- D'où les heures supplémentaires.
- 2 inspecteurs sur un dossier majeur ?
Qu'est-ce qui cloche dans cette ville ?
Il faut une dizaine d'hommes,
véhicules de surveillance, caméras.
- Tu veux que je fasse quoi ?
- T'es plus sur ton triple meurtre ?
J'ai des choses à faire, oui,
mais Jay m'a mise sur cette affaire.
Amène-toi.
Tu vois au moins
à quel point tu dérailles ? Hein ?
- Ils payeront. C'est que le début.
- Pour quelle affaire ?
T'as retiré une vraie affaire
à une inspectrice.
J'arrangerai ça.
Mais ces enculés finiront par dépenser
assez pour qu'on se fasse Marlo.
Observe et apprends.
T'as pété un câble, Jimmy.
Regarde-toi un peu.
Pompette une nuit sur trois, pété H/24.
À bourrer la première meuf qui passe.
Et le peu de temps passé ivre, débandé,
t'es sur des meurtres
qui existent même pas !
Prends les heures sup'
et bosse ton triple.
T'en fais pas pour tes rapports
de service, je te couvre.
- Y a quoi ?
- Bosse ton triple meurtre.
Je couvrirai chacune de tes heures
de mon côté.
Excusez-moi, monsieur.
Je suis du <i>Baltimore Sun</i>.
Je peux vous parler une minute ?
Vous avez pris rendez-vous ?
Désolé. Je suis pris tout l'après-midi.
J'écris un article sur les hommes
sans-abri tués. Entendu parler ?
Vous avez 2 $ sur vous, hein ?
Je me demandais
si les meurtres avaient changé
les choses pour vous et les autres ici.
- Vous voulez savoir pour les meurtres.
- D'où ma présence.
- Vous voulez savoir qui c'est.
- Savez-vous qui c'est ?
Je le sais. Vous tiendrez le coup
en l'entendant ?
Votre nom ?
Nathan Levi Boston.
Et le tueur ?
Croyez-vous que Satan marche sur terre
sous une forme charnelle ?
Que Satan peut habiter
les âmes des hommes ?
Et il ne fait que commencer.
Il y aura plein d'autres morts
avant que ce ne soit fini.
Des centaines. Voire des milliers.
On m'a dit que tu travaillais toujours
dans ce trou, mais je le croyais pas.
C'est pas énorme, mais ça fait des mois
qu'un chef n'a pu me trouver.
Tu t'intéresses toujours
à Marlo Stanfield, exact ?
C'est son numéro de portable.
Il utilise plus de portables.
Ellis. Comment ?
Travail de police, inspecteur.
Travail de police.
Yo, c'est le High Hat ?
<i>Quoi ?</i>
C'est toujours ouvert, le à emporter ?
Je veux un steak aux piments verts.
<i>Faux numéro, ducon.</i>
J'aurais aimé pouvoir dire
que c'est un choc.
Mais cela semble arriver
dans toutes les villes où on atteint
une place au pouvoir
et où on devient des cibles.
- Vous avez bien raison.
- Je ne parle pas de Noir/Blanc.
Le procureur de l'État, M. Bond,
il est noir.
Mais si cela sert son intérêt,
fait parler de lui aux infos,
améliore son image,
il fera ce que les décideurs
veulent qu'il fasse.
Que ce soit de la diffamation,
faire le noeud de la corde,
quoi que ce soit.
Mais ils ont mal choisi leur homme.
- Ils ne devaient pas vous connaître.
- Je ne fuis pas le combat.
- Je sais bien.
- Le peuple sait.
Je parle du peuple, là.
Le peuple sait ce que j'ai fait
pour Baltimore Ouest et cette ville.
Les combats que je mène à Annapolis
chaque jour.
Et que ces accusations
ne sont que des C-O-N-N-E-R-I-E-S.
Retenez-vous. C'est la radio.
Je dois me retenir, je sais.
Je veux pas qu'on vous retire
votre licence d'émission,
donc je peux pas
m'exprimer pleinement.
Mais j'ai voulu venir ici,
dans votre émission ce soir,
et merci beaucoup pour l'opportunité,
mon frère,
mais je voulais que vos auditeurs
soient les premiers
à l'entendre de ma bouche.
Je n'ai commis aucun crime,
et je vais continuer
le travail du peuple sans ralentir.
Merci, sénateur.
Et également, je veux
que tout le monde sache
qu'il y aura un rassemblement
au palais de justice Mitchell
demain à 14 heures
pour que le peuple puisse être entendu.
Et en bon nombre, j'espère.
14 heures sur Calvert Street.
- Il est temps d'élever toutes les voix.
- Je suis d'accord.
Trois inspecteurs pour une écoute
téléphonique 24 heures sur 24.
Quatre de plus pour deux équipes
de surveillance de deux.
Deux voitures banalisées.
Je ne demande pas la lune, Cedric !
Lester, si je les avais,
je vous les donnerais.
C'est le numéro de portable de l'enculé
qui nous a refilé 22 macchabées !
- Allez voir le maire !
- Je suis allé le voir.
Je l'ai supplié à genoux déjà 2 fois.
Une fois pour votre affaire.
Et je n'ai pu avoir que deux hommes
pour l'affaire Clay Davis.
Et hier, pour le tueur en série
sur lequel travaille la Crim ?
Que 2 hommes.
J'ai fait mon boulot. Je suis toujours
allé voir la hiérarchie.
Mais si un putain de tueur en série
ne donne pas plus de 2 inspecteurs,
qu'est-ce que ça change
que vous ayez un numéro récent ?
Ils ont affecté plus d'hommes, d'après
les Opérations de renseignement.
- Et ?
- Commencé par la 1re victime.
Ancien marine.
Bronze Star au Viêt Nam.
Sa famille l'a supplié de rentrer,
ce qu'il faisait parfois,
mais ils l'avaient pas vu depuis un mois
avant le meurtre.
C'est du bon.
Du très bon.
- En retard, mais tu as des infos ?
- La moitié
sont des malades,
l'autre veut juste emprunter un billet.
Mais, oui, j'ai des trucs de bien.
Une famille de quatre
sous le pont de Hanover Street.
Le père a fondu en larmes
quand je lui ai parlé,
disant qu'il pouvait pas se protéger,
qu'il pouvait pas protéger ses enfants.
La mère caressait
les cheveux blonds du plus petit.
On a des noms, n'est-ce pas ?
Le type s'appelle...
Boston. Nathan Levi Boston.
Bien. Tu as 4 feuillets si tu veux.
Tu seras en une avec Alma et Fletch.
Olesker a aussi écrit une sacrée bonne
chronique, pour la une de Métro.
File. Écris.
Ce tueur en série rend
un Baltimorien très, très heureux.
Clay Davis.
Un cycle d'infos, et sa mise en examen
disparaît de la une.
Quand ça saigne,
c'est sur le devant de la scène.
Un putain de tueur en série.
Je leur donne un fou maniaque sexuel
suffisamment bizarroïde
pour mettre la ville dans tous ses états
et qu'est-ce qu'on en tire ?
Un seul putain d'inspecteur.
Et lequel ? Kima Greggs,
qui devrait bosser sur son triple.
Donc, je peux pas te refiler ses heures
sans niquer du travail honnête.
C'est plus facile, Jimmy.
- On a plus besoin d'autant.
- On a besoin
- d'une mise sur écoute.
- Je peux la contrôler moi-même.
Putain, tout ce qu'on en tirera
sera irrecevable de toute façon.
Faut donc que personne s'en approche.
Sydnor, peut-être.
- Je peux lui faire confiance.
- Tu commences à obtenir des infos,
t'auras besoin d'au moins deux voitures
de surveillance dans la rue.
On verra ça à ce moment-là.
L'important,
c'est qu'il nous facilite la tâche.
Avant, avec tous ces face-à-face,
on avait besoin de quoi ?
Caméras de surveillance, microphones,
une demi-dizaine de gars
pour une surveillance continue.
Mais maintenant, suffit qu'il parle
au téléphone, et je le tiens.
Alors, comment soutirer une mise
sur écoute de mon tueur en série ?
Faut qu'il appelle quelqu'un.
Qui ?
Le maire.
Le cardinal Keeler.
Cal Ripken. On s'en branle.
Un numéro bidon sur les papiers
pour le palais de justice,
le numéro de portable de Marlo
sonorisé.
C'est du génie, putain...
Ou pas.
S'il s'agit de ton affaire,
tu dois répondre.
N'oublie pas, tu es sur un tueur.
Nan, c'est mon ex-femme.
Elle a appelé toute la soirée. Comme si
j'avais le temps pour ses conneries.
Mais ils doivent
croire que c'est ton tueur qui appelle
avant de payer une mise sur écoute.
OK. Et merde. Appelle ton pote Oscar.
Dis-lui qu'il nous faut un autre corps.
Mais cette fois, ce gros malade
va appeler M. Ripken
en confiant une chose
que seul le tueur peut savoir.
Ça devrait les secouer assez
pour des mises sur écoute.
Monk aime bien se coucher
de bonne heure.
Trois entrent et un sort.
Meilleures chances.
On va quand même attendre.
Ils vont encore baisser leur garde.
Si c'est pas soir ce, le suivant.
T'es un homme patient.
Toi aussi.
Je t'ai appelé toute la journée.
J'ai appelé Beadie, qui ignorait...
Je sais. C'est de ma faute.
Ils sont toujours debout ?
- Salut, les gars.
- Salut, papa.
Sean, sache que j'ai tout fait pour
essayer de venir te voir jouer ce soir.
Salut, Mike.
C'est pas grave. T'inquiète.
Ta mère a dit que tu as assuré.
Montre-moi.
- Que j'entende.
- Je sais pas. C'est nul comme ça.
Faut voir le groupe dans l'ensemble.
- C'est quel groupe, ça ?
- Dead Meadow.
- Dead Metal ?
- Meadow. Dead Meadow.
Et les Ramones, ça le fait plus ?
Je me ferai pardonner le week-end
prochain. On ira voir un match.
C'est ça, la vie, Jimmy.
C'est ces choses-là qui importent.
- Je sais.
- J'ai parlé à Beadie.
Elle sait qu'elle est en train
de te perdre. Comme je le savais.
Je ne porte pas de jugement.
Je ne dis pas ça pour te blesser.
Mais elle s'en rend compte.
Et elle s'y prépare,
tout comme je m'y préparais.
Tu bois.
Tu es dehors toute la nuit.
Elle ne sait pas où tu es.
Elle est pas bête, Jimmy.
Je suis triste
que ce ne fut pas avec moi,
mais je suis content pour toi.
Je sais. T'imagines un peu ?
J'étais contente
que tu l'aies trouvée.
J'étais même contente pour elle.
Pendant un moment,
je t'avais jamais vu aussi heureux.
Elle est super.
Vraiment.
Ne fais pas ça.
Ça va, Bubs ?
Ça va.
Ça va.
À part un truc auquel je pense.
- Mais je t'en parlerai après.
- Je peux prendre une minute.
J'ai besoin de savoir un truc. En même
temps, j'ignore si je veux le savoir.
Il vaut mieux savoir, Bubs.
J'en suis la preuve vivante.
Ils ont des médocs et tout, maintenant.
Pourquoi t'y penses maintenant ?
Je suis bénévole à Viva House,
j'ai fait comme tu m'as dit.
Le responsable veut
que je serve les repas.
Tu peux. Ça se transmet pas comme ça.
Je sais, on dit ça,
mais j'ai le sentiment...
Je sais pas.
Je suis allé au dispensaire hier.
J'ai pas pu passer
la porte, mais...
Dur d'y aller seul.
Donne-moi 10 minutes.
Alors, que fait-on aujourd'hui ?
À moins que l'histoire se développe,
je crois qu'on a pensé à tout.
Je dirais qu'Alma peut faire des vérifs.
On verra où on en est cet après-midi.
Tu me dois un article sur Govans.
Et tu dois voir Shane
pour les articles sur l'école.
Je sais pas, Gus.
Cette histoire est prometteuse.
Je pourrais patrouiller avec les flics.
- Les regarder prévenir les SDF.
- Bonne idée,
mais Alma peut inclure ça
dans son travail.
Occupé ?
Nan. J'étais juste...
Jimmy n'est pas encore arrivé.
Je sais. Il cuve au lit.
- Longue nuit, hein ?
- Elles le sont toutes en ce moment.
Détends-toi. Je suis pas
à la recherche d'un mouchard.
Tu es son complice dans le crime.
Mais ça m'est égal.
Je veux juste avoir ton avis
sur la direction que ça prend.
Tu le connais. Tu sais
de quoi il est capable ou non.
- Je sais pas si je peux me prononcer.
- Je suis prête
à le mettre à la porte.
Pour moi, pour mes enfants...
Si, au final,
il ne peut pas aller plus loin.
S'il ne peut pas être meilleur que ça,
je veux seulement savoir.
Il est sur une affaire en ce moment.
Un tueur en série.
Ne me raconte pas
qu'il s'agit d'une affaire.
- Utilise ce bobard avec une civile.
- Écoute.
Des fois, il a la tête ailleurs,
et il prend un verre.
Comme beaucoup d'entre nous.
C'est plus qu'un seul verre qu'il prend.
Beadie, je peux pas te dire quoi faire.
J'aime pas renoncer.
Je dois retourner bosser.
Merci de m'avoir laissée décharger.
On commence aujourd'hui ?
- Plus vite on choisit une école...
- Après le déj', oui.
Enfin trouvé une veine, hein ?
C'était pas facile.
Elles se cachent depuis des années.
- Je suis une pro.
- Moi aussi.
Une question.
Quand arrivent les résultats ?
D'ici environ une heure.
Voilà.
Et ils veulent vous faire croire
qu'il n'y a qu'une version
de cette histoire,
et que leurs soi-disant faits
ne peuvent être niés.
Mais nous avons des faits à nous,
n'est-ce pas ?
Nous savons qui sont nos chefs de file.
Et nous ne voulons pas qu'ils les
choisissent pour nous, n'est-ce pas ?
Nous n'allons pas rester immobiles
pendant qu'ils choisissent
nos chefs de file
et les poursuivent en justice
sélectivement...
ou plutôt les persécutent
juste parce qu'ils ont le courage
et la fortitude
de nous défendre !
Qu'ils vous entendent !
Faites-vous entendre de façon claire !
Clay Davis ne va nulle part,
n'est-ce pas ?
Nous avons besoin de lui !
Nous allons le garder !
Et maudit soit celui
qui dit le contraire !
Clay Davis !
C'est quoi, ce bordel,
comme quoi tu prendrais pas sur toi ?
Tu as mal entendu, vieil ami.
- Je vais encaisser.
- T'as intérêt.
Car, sinon, tu ne pourras pas
soutirer un billet vert de plus
à cette ville
jusqu'à la fin de tes jours.
<i>We shall not be
We shall not be moved</i>
Regarde-moi ça.
- C'est quoi ?
- Nouvelle allure.
Elles ont l'air plutôt bonnes habillées.
Clarice.
Ton tueur en série
a appelé le <i>Baltimore Sun</i>.
Un fêlé, qui prétend être ton homme,
a appelé un journaliste.
- Un des gars écrit un article.
- Ça doit être un appel bidon.
Probablement.
Mais vu que c'est le putain de journal,
tu vas là-bas
et tu leur fais ouvrir les yeux.
Vas-y.
Négatif.
- Négatif veut dire...
- Je sais ce que ça veut dire.
- Ça doit être une erreur.
- Y a pas d'erreur.
Avec tout ce que j'ai fait ?
Tout le matos que j'ai partagé ?
Mon poteau, avant, j'ai utilisé
la même shooteuse des tas de fois.
Il avait le das, obligé.
C'est impossible, ce truc.
Tu es déçu.
Il s'agit pas du das, hein ?
Mais de toi qui veux faire du passé
un élément central.
Tu veux même pas penser du présent.
Désolé, Bubs.
La honte vaut pas
autant que tu le croies.
Tourne la page.
Il voulait que les gens sachent
qu'il y aurait 12 corps au final.
Il a dit : "Je suis venu en prendre 12."
- J'ai demandé : "Et après 12 ?"
- Il a répondu :
"Je vais ailleurs."
Pour les morsures, il a dit
qu'ils voulaient qu'il les morde.
Qu'ils ont demandé ça.
Il s'est plaint
de l'article qui l'a fait passer
pour un pervers.
Je lui ai demandé s'il en voulait
aux hommes. Il a raccroché.
Il vous a appelé sur votre portable ?
Pourquoi pas le journal ?
J'ai distribué dans toute la ville hier
mes cartes aux hommes sans-abri.
C'est là qu'il a dû avoir mon numéro.
Ça se trouve, je lui en ai donné une.
Je pense que c'est lui. J'en ai eu
un frisson dans le dos, inspecteur.
On peut pas savoir.
Si c'est un autre détraqué,
on aura l'air idiots si on publie ça.
Votre portable a gardé le numéro ?
Il vous a appelé.
J'ai rappelé. Téléphone public
à South Hanover près de West Street.
- Il avait l'air de ?
- Pardon ?
Votre métier, c'est de parler aux gens.
Avait-il l'air noir, blanc, jeune, âgé ?
- Voix aiguë ou grave ?
- Il m'avait l'air d'être blanc.
Pas une voix grave, mais calme,
presque monocorde.
Il avait l'air âgé. Je dirais...
la quarantaine. Pas très jeune.
- Je peux avoir votre bloc-notes ?
- Vous ne pouvez pas.
Ce n'est pas une source confidentielle,
on n'invoquera donc pas la shield law,
mais il tapera une copie
qu'il vous donnera.
Mais le document original
est la propriété du <i>Baltimore Sun</i>.
Alors, tapez-le,
c'est-à-dire tout de suite.
Ça pourrait être le tueur ?
Officieusement ?
La brigade criminelle
a reçu un appel ce matin
d'un téléphone public
du même quartier.
Vu la description de la voix par Scott
et de l'utilisation du nombre 12,
eh bien, disons qu'on doit trouver
qui a passé ces deux appels.
Il a passé un autre appel ?
Inspecteur, en tant que journaliste,
je suis enclin à inclure
ces détails dans notre article
s'il y a une chance que le tueur ait été
en contact avec notre journaliste.
Agir ainsi aurait-il un effet négatif
sur votre enquête ?
À vrai dire, ces appels sont notre
meilleur moyen de trouver ce type.
Chaque appel qu'il passe, chaque mot
qu'il prononce, à vous et à nous,
ne peut que fournir des informations.
- Si on publie un article...
- Ne dites pas qu'il contacte la police.
Vous ne pouvez imprimer ça,
quelles que soient les circonstances.
OK. Alors, comment qualifier ce que
pense la police de cet appel à Scott ?
Vous pouvez dire que...
nous prenons ça au sérieux.
Pour la suite, est-il possible
que vous nous accordiez une
autorisation unilatérale de surveiller
les téléphones de votre journaliste ?
- Impossible.
- Désolé, inspecteur,
mais notre capacité journalistique
dépend du maintien de la confidentialité
de nos conversations.
Nous sommes parfaitement disposés
à partager avec vous les informations
que cette personne a, vu qu'il n'est
pas une source confidentielle.
Mais nous ne laisserons pas la police
de Baltimore surveiller nos appels.
- Vous allez sonoriser la cabine.
- N'imprimez pas ça non plus.
N'imprimez rien sur l'endroit
d'où le tueur appelle.
Il changerait.
Je vais vite taper mes notes.
Gros article, hein ?
Il y a 10 minutes, j'aurais dit
que c'était qu'un ramassis de conneries.
Ça montre ce que je sais, faut croire.
<i>C'est pour ça que je vais me battre.</i>
<i>Je suis innocent.
Je n'ai rien fait si ce n'est</i>
- <i>servir le peuple.</i>
- <i>Je vous crois, sénateur.</i>
<i>J'ai vu le travail que vous avez fait
pour la communauté.</i>
<i>Vous avez mon sout...</i>
C'est Eddie Cantor, hein ?
C'est parfait.
McNulty, c'est parfait.
J'y croyais pas. Je suis assis là.
Toutes ces conneries que je me tape,
me disant que c'est une perte de temps.
Puis je me rends compte :
voici l'écoute téléphonique.
Sur un plateau. Pas besoin que je passe
un coup de fil bidon à quelqu'un.
J'ai devant moi
la putain d'écoute de Lester Freamon.
Et s'ils vérifient ?
Combien de gars dans cette brigade
ont déjà branché une écoute ?
Ils ne savent pas quel fil va où.
Bon, réexplique-moi,
car je vais te dire,
je suis pas con,
mais ça, ça me chauffe le crâne.
Ils pensent être
sur le portable de ton tueur,
mais ils intercepteront aucun appel
car ce fil
ne va nulle part. Pendant ce temps,
avec la même autorisation du tribunal,
je suis sur une vraie écoute
au détachement
à écouter Marlo. Tous les jours,
tu fais un rapport au bureau
et au tribunal
disant qu'il n'y a eu aucun autre
contact avec le tueur en série.
Je consigne rien,
mais utilise ce que j'entends
pour monter l'affaire
sur notre vraie cible.
- Une fois au tribunal...
- Aucune mention d'une écoute.
- Tout repose sur un indic.
- Voilà.
Quatre copies signées par le juge.
Ordonnance d'urgence
pour une interception téléphonique
d'un téléphone portable,
numéro 410-915-0909.
Si l'appareil est installé,
vous pouvez y aller.
- À vous.
- Bonne chasse.
Holley ?
Tu as la période de nuit.
Worden sera là pour te relayer à 6 h.
Après Worden, mon équipe
surveillera pendant la journée.
Excusez-moi.
Fais pas le grincheux.
On paye des heures sup' pour ça.
O-Dog !
Ma jambe !
Reste à terre, putain !
Putain, mais...
Putain.
Putain, mais...
Joe will be missed.
Very much missed.
We liked Joe.
A hard man not to like.
Tomorrow ain't
promised to no one.
Meanwhile, we go on.
In business-- in life--
What you learn to appreciate
the most is a dependable man.
One day, same as the next.
Yeah, I learned a lot
from watching Joe.
We deal with you
or your second.
No one else.
No one else knows our names.
No one else contacts us.
Understand?
To contact us, use this...
only.
I don't talk on no cellphones.
Here.
To call for lunch, you can talk.
To call your girl,
you can talk.
To call your lawyer even,
you can talk--
The law says
that is between you and the laer.
All right?
To find out what movie is
playing down the street,
You can talk.
All of that is good because
all of that tells them there
there is nothing good to hear.
But for business,
we do not talk on the phone.
Never.
Right.
I mean,
Joe taught me that.
But what about--
What is...
How that play?
Man overcame his grief.
Do it feel like a crown
on your head right now?
Do it?
'Cause that's what
I'm wearin' on my head.
We should celebrate.
Yeah?
Atlantic city.
Can't play like that now.
Omar gonna make a move.
We know this.
Yo, I need to go past home.
You mind a ride?
Naw. You know I like your peoples.
Fact is, I gotta tell 'em I'm not
gonna be comin' round for a time.
You stepped up and made your play.
Now I gotta make mine.
- At least 4.
- <i>Got it</i>.
We're going back through the old cases,
so we could find more than that.
<i>What else?</i>
And the motive now seems sexual.
What do you mean sexual?
Is someone
sodomizing homeless men?
<i>I can't get that specific.</i>
How can I not get specific?
I'm just saying the killer is acting
from sexual compulsions.
Anything more detailed than that
we need to keep in the case file.
<i>I don't know, detective. Last time,
I couldn't get it out front on metro.</i>
But let me run it by my desk
and call you back. All right?
All right.
Anything late from copshop?
Follow-ups on the recent murders.
An arrest on one, which was
the domestic cutting from Hampden.
No arrests in a couple of drug-relateds
from east Baltimore.
Give me a bit for the budget line.
Domestic was a Patricia boggus,
found in her car.
Drug-Relateds were one Joseph Stewart,
found in his dining room,
and one Nathaniel Manns,
found in an alley garage.
A couple grafs on each.
Write it as a single short.
Also, I got word
on another homeless murder.
The detective on it says it's related.
He says it's sexual.
Sexual?
- They being raped?
- He wouldn't confirm that.
He just says that the killings
are sexual in nature.
Write what you got.
I'll run it by the 4:00,
see if it takes.
This indictment is the result
of an 18-month investigation
by the state's attorney's office
and the Baltimore police department.
And it shines a light
on a cornerstone issue
for any representative government--
Public trust
of public servants.
Senator Davis
abused that trust.
He traded on his power and
influence so that he could use
local businesses
and campaign donors
as his personal A.T.M. machine.
He created a network of charitable
and non-profit organizations
whose purpose was to accumulate cash
for his private use,
- betraying the goodwill...
- Ronnie Pearlman?
Bill Zorzi, covering
federal court for the "Sun."
Right.
How do you do?
Not to be all petulant
on your special day here,
But since when
does a prosecutor of this town
stage a perp walk
and not call the daily newspaper?
We called Gail Gibson.
Left a message on her voice mail.
Gail left for a freelance gig
4 months ago.
Well, her voice mail still works.
Who's replacing her on city courts?
From now on,
just don't jam me like that again.
...he must be he accountable
for his fraudulent actions.
Senator Davis has opened
our legislative body
<i>to monetary persuasions.</i>
<i>He has done this knowingly
and with complete disregard</i>
<i>for the office that he represents.</i>
- It is this kind of impropriety...
- How's it feel, Clay?
Not much fun on the ass end, is it?
You said it, Norman.
There's the short Con
and the long Con.
You're gonna need a statement.
Nothing too joyful.
You don't dance on Clay's grave until
you're sure the motherfucker's dead.
Clay ain't getting up from this.
Also you don't want
to piss off his base,
being too gleeful about it.
That guy still has a base?
After all this shit he's pulled?
I'll tell you one thing.
That fella right there
is looking pretty damn mayoral.
More than Nerese, definitely.
With the profile he gets from this,
I'd say it's Mr. Bond's race to lose.
<i>...and remain under common court.</i>
<i>Senator Davis
will have to account for that money.</i>
- What'd you tell your girl?
- That I'm goin' away on business.
I won't be around for a couple weeks.
- Shouldn't be more than that.
- Better not.
... and miss Trainor say
we gonna learn a problem like that
once every day for
this year and the next.
You mean memorize 'em?
Learn it by heart.
Learn the question.
Learn the answer, too.
'Cause them questions gonna all been
the M.S.A. test you all take next year.
She tell you all that?
Miss Trainor say if the scores
don't go up before the selection
all the teachers gonna get fired.
Selection?
What she mean?
When the people vote for whoever.
You mean the election.
Nigga think you all that.
Why you gonna go and do that?
- Dukie about to cry.
- Fuck is wrong with you?
Ain't nothin' wrong with me!
I'm out here gettin' stuff done.
You up in some house somewhere
playin' Mike's lil' bitch.
Smacked his little ass.
... and finally, we've got
that 40-inch thumbsucker on Bud Selig
and baseball's halfhearted response
to the latest recommendations
on steroid use.
Bottom line is
the owners think bud is swell,
The players union is staying mum,
Bondsashe home run record, and
everyone's pretending
the issue will go away.
And there's news in there?
What do you like for the front?
Clay Davis indictment, obviously.
The congressional hearings on Iraq.
Price's piece on how much Carcetti raise
for his gubernatorial run is solid.
And the feature on John Waters
filming again in Baltimore
could go out front if the art is good.
We have him on the film set,
posing with a couple of child actors.
Is that allowed?
Now. Let's not confuse
the auteur with his art.
- Anyone like anything else?
- This came in late, but
this business at the bottom
of the metro budget
about another homeless man being
murdered-- That might have some play.
There were other homeless men murdered?
We ran a short piece a week ago
about possible connections in 3 cases.
- Inside metro.
- The motive's said to be sexual,
but the cops are being cryptic
about what exactly That means.
Well, we could run it inside, but
you might want to Report it some more,
see where it goes.
Right now, it's a little vague for A-1.
OK, then, we'll see where
we are in a couple hours.
I told you, duke.
I fuck 'em up good.
Just say the word, man.
Naw, man. I can't have you steppin' up
for me anymore, you know?
Yeah, well.
Talk to the man.
He'll set you straight.
- Yo, Mr. Dennis.
- Hey.
I need to train with you some.
See that.
What happened?
It ain't no thing. I'm just
kinda gettin' a little tired of it.
All right, son.
Go get some gloves on
and let's see where you at.
It's all pretty straightforward.
I'm surprised the lawyers
you were paying went to the trouble
of getting it postponed.
Maybe 'cause we was payin' by the hour.
In any event,
you got a lot going for you here.
Car registered to a front,
guns in a secreted compartment.
The woman we registered it to,
She can't do no time.
Just a name we used.
Then get someone who can.
Preferably someone without priors,
someone you trust to Stand the charge.
Also came past with this here.
More money made clean.
When you figure out
what we gonna do with that there,
- Holler at me.
- How do I do that?
410
915
0909.
Anything else?
Naw,
take me off your clock.
Fuckin' mope pisses me off.
Be generous.
I have a feeling this firm is
going to have quite a payday
from Mr. Stanfield and his people.
He just gave me his phone number.
If Marlo Stanfield
is using a cellphone,
it's just a matter of time before we're
up to our asses in pre-trial motions,
litigating a wiretap case.
Joe gave him to us just in time.
What now?
You need to attribute that?
- What?
- Fifth graf, the dependent clause.
The one about a "pattern
of widespread influence
peddling over a period of years."
Either the indictment
shows that or it doesn't.
Besides which, you begin 3 grafs
in a row with a gerund. Look.
How do you expect me to write this thing
with your Fucking fingers in my eyes?
At least let me turn my copy
in before you stomp on it.
Atta boy, Zorz.
They want more reporting on this, but
I don't see where it Can go from here.
The cops are selling a sexual motive,
but they won't explain it
any more than that.
Who are you dealing with?
Detective who has the case.
And he wants publicity?
Didn't know if you'd come back.
Took a lot of money with you.
It wasn't about the money, bro.
Wasn't never about that.
Is that him?
Old Monk prefer the condo life, I see.
Too good for a rowhouse.
Movin' with muscle, too.
Most likely they expectin' you
to make a move.
An' here I am.
How 'bout that?
Thanks for meeting me again.
This is Scott Templeton.
He'll be working the story with me.
It's not like I want everyone
at your newspaper knowing my name.
Look, you want these homeless cases
to get attention, right?
And that's what
you're trying to do here.
Guy's a predator.
- People need to know.
- Agreed.
And I understand there's things
you need to keep secret
so that you can solve the murders.
I get that.
We can't do much with this story
unless we give it enough juice.
Juice?
We need to tell people
what this is about,
why he's doing it.
We need to make
this thing come alive
or they're gonna bury the story
like they did the last time.
I told you it's sexual.
Compulsion. Obsession,
that kinda thing.
But what the fuck does that mean?
It's not like he's carving up housewives
or strangling coeds, here.
Your guy's killing homeless men.
Why exactly?
What's in his head?
Is he raping them?
Sodomizing them?
I don't have any semen
in any of the cases. I don't have that.
But he's doing something, right?
He ties a red ribbon
around their arms.
- A red ribbon?
- Yeah, a bow.
He gift-wraps the motherfuckers.
That enough juice for you?
Yeah, kinky.
But no one kills people
to tie ribbons around their arms.
Can we say they were molested?
Is it fair to say that?
- We'll go with molested then.
- You didn't get that from me.
- Another round?
- What else?
You want this story to fly
you got to give us Something different.
Keep what you need for the file,
but give us something with a twist.
A sexual serial killer isn't enough?
Cold world, I know.
He started biting them.
What?
He's biting his victims.
Inside thigh,
right ass cheek, left nipple.
- He's a biter.
- Fuck. Shit.
That twisted enough for ya?
Are we talkin' cannibalism here?
Just biting for now.
We'll see where it goes.
And did he bite all of them?
Not all.
Just the latest ones.
He's maturing.
Maturing?
It's a technical term.
It's when a serial killer's
becoming more obsessive.
He starts to develop
an intricate pattern
in what he does with the bodies.
It's weird stuff.
A biter. That's great.
My name's nowhere on this.
For your tab.
We'd stay and have one with you,
but we still have time
to make the second edition.
Thanks.
So you thinkin'
if you learn to fight some,
people 'round
the way gonna leave you be.
Thing is, even if you learn to fight,
people gonna come at you just the same.
It ain't like the movies
where you beat up one bully
and the rest just
back the hell up.
Lemme ask,
why you think the even bothering
to come at you the way they did?
I mean, why you?
See, all I know
is that right there.
I ain't never had
no use for other things.
I could fight.
For a time there,
I could run them corners.
Not much life
outside that, really.
I was on a corner for a while.
How that go?
I guess what I'm tryin' to say is...not
Everything comes down to
how you carry it in the street.
I mean, it do come down to that
if you gonna be in the street.
But that ain't the only way to be.
- 'Round here it is.
- Yeah.
'Round here it is.
World is bigger than that.
At least, that's what they tell me.
Like... how do you get from here
to the rest of the world?
I wish I knew.
Michael grew up fast.
Yeah, he did.
Anyway, for a kid like that,
my onliest plan might be fine, you know?
Might could work for
a boy like that.
But a kid come to me
with other skills,
other ways of being,
all I got is hope and wishes.
That's something, I guess.
Wish it was more, son.
I do.
Thanks.
Atta girl.
Alma, you've got the investigation{\itself}.
Anything that breaks from headquarters.{\, that's you.}
I thought I'd work back on the victims.
A profile of who these guys were.
That's a nice idea, but I already sent
Fletcher out on that about an hour ago.
What's left for me to do?
You can go and...
talk to the homeless.
React quotes from the homeless?
Just 'cause they're in the streets
doesn't mean that they lack opinions.
Where am I gonna find homeless people?
Not at home, I imagine.
Go, go, my children.
Read it and weep.
I already did.
So did the Major.
So did the Colonel.
So did our newly
christened deputy ops.
Deputy's over at city hall right now.
That was quick.
Just 'cause you got
some fuckin' reporter
to buy your weak shit does not mean
everyone else buys it.
5 gets you 10,
deputy's over there right now,
talking them back down to earth.
Is this nut raping them?
Well, I haven't debriefed
The investigators in detail,
but the office reports don't indicate
penetration or ejaculation.
What can we do?
What can we say we're doing already?
We've got good people working it.
{\Obviously, }It would be better if I could
keep them on it around the clock.
- You're talking overtime.
- If you could lift the cap
- for this particular Investigation.
- Done.
Unlimited overtime for two detectives.
- Anything they need.
- Sir, a case like this,
where we're proactively trying
to prevent additional murders,
is going to require more
than two detectives.
I got the school
board chairman telling me
he's a short hair away from
laying off 50 middlechool teachers
and shutting down special education
in every elementary school in the city
in violation of a
federal consent decree.
To the extent that I've got more
than an extra couple of dollars,
you aren't getting it.
Embracing the hard choice.
It's one of the--
One of the burdens of command.
Is there anything you can do
to further protect the homeless?
We can have trol units
spread the warning,
try to convince anyone on the street to
move into the city shelters after dark.
Can you have police sit on locations
where the homeless gather?
- Monitor them like that?
- And still answer the calls?
Not without doubling up post units,
which means overtime.
Overtime, again.
Blood in our veins, Mr. Mayor.
Every day, you look more like a boss.
- Fuck you.
- I didn't mean it like a bad thing.
Yeah, you did.
Yeah, I did.
What's that?
A gift from your one true partner
Cellphone number-- Marlo Stanfield.
- How the fuck did you--
- Don't ask, don't tell.
It's like one of tho guys
sucking dick in the army.
Whatever else
I ever did to piss you off,
remember I also did this.
And, Carv?
When you put the bracelets
on that bitch,
remind him again of my fuckin' camera.
You can tell all of 'em--
Royce, the caucus,
all them Graspin' bitches who we put
in every city department--
You tell every last one
that I do not fall alone.
You think I'm gonna be the scapegoat
for the whole damn machine?
Shheeeeeet!
Clarence is going to stand with you.
He told me so. He'll be out there.
Easy for him.
He ain't runnin' for nuthin' no more.
I don't see you and
your kind with me on this.
A whole mess o' people think
they belong on the fence, don't they?
- It is what it is.
- Y'all better hope not.
Or it ain't gonna
end with Clay Davis.
Just take a moment and think
about what you're saying here.
You can have yourself a pity party,
talk all kinda shit to some prosecutor.
You know where you'll be then?
Out in the damn cold.
No connections, no allies,
nowhere to hang your hat
in this damn town.
Or you carry this for all of us,
carry it as far as you can.
And if the worst happens,
if they take your seat,
if you go away for a year or so
to some minimum-security summer camp,
then so what?
You come home to a town
that still knows your name.
Look at Burrell.
He goes quietly and now he's making
12 a year more
than when he was commissioner
and working half the hours.
You think that happens
if he does the piss-and-moan?
Prosecutors come
and prosecutors go.
But win or lose, you still gonna be
back around before we know it.
Am I right, Senator Davis?
You want me to find another carry-out?
Someplace closer?
- You don't like this food?
- I'm sayin',
I don't like the way them
chinky muhfuckas be acting sometimes.
The way they be lookin' at me.
Don't worry about it.
Chris with you?
Behind me.
What you got on?
What?
You want that faggot
to know we waitin' on his ass?
Just bein' careful is all.
If I can see the vest, you don't think
that he could see the vest?
I'm the one{\ that's} baitin' him, {\though, }right?
{\It seems }I'm the only one
who's not hidin' out.
Ain't no thing.
'Cause when Omar comin' at you,
he gon' be gunnin' at your head.
I know I would be.
Stayed outside of Monk's all night.
They left before morning though.
They'll be back. No doubt.
Do you hear a lot of concern
regarding these murders?
- Haven't heard anybody mention it.
- No?
Most of the folks we serve
aren't actually homeless.
Most are working poor.
So most of the people
I interviewed here weren't--
Homeless? No.
Some, maybe.
- Why didn't you--
- You seemed to be getting along OK.
I didn't want to ruin it for you.
Where would you suggest I go then?
Streets maybe.
The reporter
the "Sun" papers sent over?
Not exactly Bob Woodward.
Hell of a job, Bubs.
But you know we need help tomorrow
waiting tables in the back room.
If you don't like it,
then I won't ask again.
Gotta hold it
with both hands, you know?
Tryin' to hit
what you aimin' at, a-ight?
It's not like they do in the movies.
Not goin' to work.
A-Ight, so come on,
spread your legs.
What's the first thing you gotta do?
Jack a round in the chamber.
Like this, watch.
Go ahead.
It's hard to do.
A-Ight.
So then...
try this.
It's a tool, just like a monkey wrench,
that's all it is, a-ight?
I ain't know it was gon' be so loud.
Why you even want to do this?
What is you thinkin', duke?
You think if you start carryin'
ain't nobody gonna try you?
Nah.
Somebody's always gonna try you.
An' if they know that you carryin' they
gonna make you Come out with it.
An' once you come out with it,
you gotta be ready to go all the way.
You can't bring it out
unless you willin' to use it.
Can't be no doubt.
Man, can't shoot,
can't fight.
Can't even stand on the damn corner.
You got other skills, man.
You smart like that.
I don't know, Bunk.
You can't believe
everything you read nowadays.
Well, my little shit-stirrer.
As per your request
for additional manpower and manhours,
unlimited overtime has been approved
for the investigation into
the killings of homeless men...
for you and one
other detective only.
What about surveillance teams?
We need to be watching some of
these places, watching the smokehounds.
Two detectives only.
You and the stalwart detective Greggs
here are what has Been authorized.
Nothing beyond that.
What the fuck, Jay? I'm working
a serial killer here. It's a red ball.
- Hence the overtime.
- But two detectives working a red ball?
What{\ the fuck's} wrong with this city?
We need hours for a dozen men.
We need surveillance vehicles, cameras.
What do you want from me?
Ain't you still working that triple
from two weeks ago?
I got stuff
I could run down on that, yeah.
But Jay put me on this here.
Come here.
Do you even see how fucking wrong
you are? Do you even see it?
They're gonna pay for this case, Bunk.
- This is just the beginning.
- {\Pay for }What case?
You just took a real detective
off a real case behind your bullshit.
I'll fix that.
But eventually, these motherfuckers
are gonna pay
out enough for us
to do Marlo Stanfield.
Just watch and learn.
You've lost your fucking mind.
Look at you.
Half-lit every third night,
dead drunk every second.
Nut deep in random pussy.
And what little time you do
spend sober and limp-dicked,
you're working murders
that don't even exist.
Take the O.T. and work
the hell out of your triple.
Don't worry about your office reports.
I cover you for the bosses.
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just work your triple.
I'll cover every hour
of it from my case file.
Excuse me, sir. Sir.
I'm with the "Baltimore Sun."
Can I talk with you a minute?
You make an appointment?
Sorry.
I'm booked up all afternoon.
I'm doing a story on the homeless men
who've Been killed.
You heard about that?
You got two dollars on you, right?
I was wondering if the murders
had changed things
for you and the other
fellas out here.
You wanna know about them murders?
- That's why I'm out here.
- Wanna know who's doing it?
- Do you know who's doing it?
- I do.
Can you handle hearing it?
What's your name?
Nathan Levi Boston.
And you know who the killer is?
Do you believe Satan
walks the earth in a fleshly form?
That satan can occupy
the souls of men?
And he's just getting started.
There's gonna be
a lot more dead before it's over.
Hundreds.
Maybe thousands.
They told me they still had you
working outta this shithole,
but I didn't believe it.
It ain't much, but it's been months
since a boss has been able to find me.
You still have some interest
in Marlo Stanfield, right?
That's his cell.
He stopped using cellphones.
Ellis.
How?
Police work, detective.
Police work.
Yo, this the high hat?
<i>Say what?</i>
Y'all still open for carryout?
- I want some of that pepper steak.
- <i>Wrong number, fool.</i>
I wish I could tell you
it's a shock.
But it seems to happen
in every city where we get us
a place inside the power structure
and we become targets.
I know you're right.
I'm not saying
it's a black-white thing.
The state's attorney,
Mr. Bond, he's black.
But if it serves his purpose--
Gets his name in the news,
ups his profile--
He'll do whatever the folks
pulling the strings want him to do.
Whether it be character assassination,
tie the noose in the rope, whatever.
But they picked
the wrong man this time.
They must not 'a heard
about you, Senator.
- I don't run from a fight.
- I know that.
'Cause the people know--
Now I'm talkin' 'bout the people now--
The people know
what I've done for west Baltimore
and this city as a whole.
They know the battles I fight
in Annapolis every day.
They know these charges
ain't nothing but B.S.
Hey, hold it now.
It's radio.
I gotta hold my tongue, I know.
I don't want nobody pullin'
y'all's broadcasting license,
So I can't say it like I feel it.
But I wanted to come here
on your show tonight--
And thank you so much
for the opportunity, my brother--
But I wanted your listeners to be
the first to hear it from my mouth.
I have committed no crime,
And I am gonna keep on doing the
people's work without breaking stride.
I want to thank you for that, senator.
And also I want everybody to know,
lighty dine, everybody to know
there's going to be a gathering
at the Mitchell courthouse
tomorrow at 2:00
So that people can be heard on this.
And I hope they come out
in good numbers.
2:00 on Calvert street.
- It's time to lift every voice.
- I heard that.
3 detectives for a 24-hour wiretap.
4 more for a couple
2-man surveillance teams.
A pair of unmarked cars.
I'm not asking the world here, Cedric.
Lester, if I had it, you'd have it.
That's the cell number
of the motherfucker
who put 22 bodies on us.
- Go to the fucking mayor!
- I've been to the mayor.
I've been to him
on my knees twice already.
Once for your case, remember?
And all I could bring back was
2 men to work Clay Davis.
And yesterday, for the serial
killer that homicide was working?
2 men only.
I've done my job.
I've gone up the ladder every time.
But if a{\ fucking} serial killer can't bring back
more than a couple detectives,
What the hell does it matter
that you have a fresh phone number?
More manpower's been assigned,
according to the P.I.O.
And?
I led with the first victim.
Ex-Marine.
Bronze-Star in Vietnam.
His family begged him to come home,
which he would do now and then,
but they hadn't seen him
in a month before the murder.
Good shit.
Real good shit.
Late, but you got the goods, right?
Half of these guys in the streets
are whack jobs,
the other half
just want to borrow a fin.
But yeah, I got good stuff.
Got a family of 4
under the Hanover street bridge.
Father broke down and cried
when I talked to him,
Talking about how he couldn't protect
himself, couldn't protect his kids.
Mother just kept stroking
the youngest one's blonde hair.
We got names on this, right?
Guy's name is, um...
Boston.
Nathan Levi Boston.
OK, you got 30 inches,
if you need them.
You're going off the front
in a package with Alma and Fletch.
Olesker wrote a pretty damn good
column, too, for Metro front.
Go, go. Write, write.
This serial killer is making
one Baltimorean very, very happy.
Clay Davis.
One news cycle, and his indictment's
gonna be off the front page.
Well, if it bleeds, it leads.
A fucking serial killer.
I give them a sex-crazed madman
who's enough of a freakshow
to get the whole city hot and bothered
and what comes back?
One fucking detective.
And who is it? Kima Greggs,
who should be working her triple.
So now I can't give you her hours
without fucking up honest casework.
Well, now it's easier, Jimmy.
We don't need as much.
Now we need a wiretap.
I can monitor that myself.
Shit, anything we get up
is gonna be illegal anyway.
So we don't want anyone
getting near it. Sydnor, maybe.
I can trust him.
You start pulling information
off that phone,
You're gonna need at least a couple
of surveillance cars in the street.
We'll worry that when we get there.
The important thing is that
he's making it easy for us.
Before, with all that face-to-face,
we were gonna need what?
Remote cameras, microphones,
half-a-dozen guys
working surveillance 24 hours.
But now he's talking on a phone,
and I got him.
So how do we squeeze a wiretap
out of my serial killer?
He's gotta call someone.
Who?
The Mayor.
Cardinal Keeler.
Cal fucking Ripken.
Who gives a fuck?
A bullshit number on the paperwork
to the courthouse,
Marlo's cell number on the tap itself.
This is fucking genius...
or not.
If that's about your case,
you need to answer it.
Remember you're working a serial killer.
Nah, it's my ex-wife.
Been calling all night. Like I got
time for her fucking bullshit.
Thing is, they got to believe
it's your killer calling
before they'll pay for a wiretap.
Well, fine. Fuck it.
Call your buddy Oscar.
Tell him we need another body.
This time the sick motherfucker
is gonna call Mr. Ripken
with something
only the killer could know.
That should shake 'em up enough
for a couple of wiretaps.
Monk sure do like to retire early.
3 go in and 1 come out.
Better odds.
We're gonna wait on it though.
They'll get better still.
If not tonight, then the next.
You're a patient man.
You, too.
I tried to reach you
on your cell all day long.
- I called Beadie, {\she said }she had no idea...
- I know, I know. It's my fault.
They still up?
Yes.
Hey, guys.
Hey, dad.
Listen, Sean.
I wanted you to know I did everything
I could to get to your play tonight.
Hey, Mike.
It's cool.
No worries.
Your mom said you were great.
Why don't you it now?
- Let me hear it.
- I dunno.
It's lame like that.
You gotta see the whole play.
- What band is that?
- Dead Meadow.
Dead metal?
Meadow.
Dead Meadow.
What the hell's wrong
with the Ramones?
I'll make it up to them next weekend.
Take 'em to the ballgame or something.
This is life, Jimmy.
This is the stuff that actually matters.
I know.
I talked to Beadie.
She knows she's losing you.
Like I knew.
I'm not judging.
I'm not saying this hurt you.
But she knows.
And she's ready for it,
the way that I was ready for it.
You're drinking.
You're out all night.
She doesn't know where you are.
And she's no fool, Jimmy.
I'm sad that it wasn't with me,
but I'm glad for you.
I know, you can imagine that?
I was glad that you found her.
I was glad for her, even.
For a while there, you were happier
than I'd ever seen you.
She's great.
She is.
Don't do this.
Hey.
You all right, Bubs?
I'm good, I'm good.
'Cept for somethin'
that's been on my mind.
- But I see you into somethin' though...
- I can take a minute.
Need to find somethin' out.
But at the same time,
I don't know if I really wanna know.
It's best to know, Bubs.
I'm living proof.
They got drugs an' shit now.
Why's it on your mind now?
Been volunteering down Viva house,
doin' like you told me.
Man say he want me to serve food.
You can. It don't travel like that.
I know they say so,
but I feel...
I dunno.
I went down to the clinic
on my own yesterday,
Got as far as the door, but...
Tough to go alone.
Yeah.
Gimme 10 minutes.
So where do we take it today?
Unless the story develops,
I think we've covered the bases.
I'd say that Alma can check on things
and see where we're at by afternoon.
You owe me a govans story.
And you need to get with Shane and
figure out what's going on
with that school series.
I dunno, Gus.
I think this thing has legs.
Maybe I go out with the cops
on their rounds.
- Watch 'em warn the homeless.
- Good thought,
but Alma can work that
into whatever file she has.
Hey.
Busy?
Naw, just, uh...
Jimmy's not in yet.
I know.
He's sleeping one off.
- Late night, huh?
- They're all like that now.
Relax.
I'm not looking for a snitch.
I know you're his partner
in crime. I don't care.
I just want to know from you
where this is going.
I mean, you know him. You know
what it is that he can and can't do.
Dunno if I can speak on that.
Look, I'm ready to put him out. OK?
For me, for my kids...
I mean, if in the end,
if this is all there is to him.
If he can't be better than this,
I just want to know.
He's working this case right now.
Serial killer, actually.
You are not gonna try
to tell me this is about a case.
- Try that shit on some civilian.
- Look,
he'll get his head in a certain place,
he'll take a drink.
I mean, a lot of us will.
It's more than just
a drink he's taking.
Beadie, I can't tell you what to do.
I don't like giving up.
OK, I gotta go back to work.
Thanks for letting me vent.
Hey, you want to get started today?
Sooner we decide on a school--
After lunch, yeah.
Finally found a line, huh?
Know that wasn't easy.
They been hidin' for years.
I'm a pro.
Me, too.
Lemme ask you...
When do results come back?
'Bout an hour from this test.
Here ya go.
And they want you to believe that
there's only one side to this story,
and that their so-called facts
cannot be denied.
But we have some facts
of our own, don't we?
We know who our leaders are.
And we don't want them
picking our leaders for us, do we?
No!
And we will not stand idly by
as they singled out our leaders
and selectively prosecute--
Or should I say persecute them--
just because they have the courage
and the fortitude to stand up for us.
Let them hear you.
Let them hear you
loud and clear.
Clay Davis isn't going
anywhere, is he?
No!
We need him,
we're going to keep him,
and damn anyone who says otherwise.
Clay Davis!
What the fuck is this I hear
about you might not stand tall on this?
You got that wrong, old friend.
- I'm gonna carry this.
- You damn sure better.
Because if you don't you won't be able
to squeeze another
greenback outta this town
for the rest of your natural life.
* We shall not be--
We shall not be moved *
Lookey here.
- The fuck is that?
- Change of pace.
They look kinda hot
with their clothes on.
Hey, clarice.
Your serial killer
called the "Baltimore Sun".
Some goof claiming to be your guy
called a reporter over there.
- One of the guys writing this shit up.
- It's gotta be a crank call.
Probably so.
But seeing as
it's the fucking newspaper,
you go over there
and you set them straight.
Go 'head.
Negative.
- Negative means...
- I know what it means.
- Must be wrong.
- It ain't wrong.
All the shit I done.
All the works I shared.
My best boy years back?
I fired off the same hype
as him dozens of times.
He had the bug for sure.
That shit ain't right nohow, man.
You're disappointed.
Shit, this ain't
about the bug, is it?
This is you, tryin' to make the past
be everything, mean everything.
You don't even wanna think
about the here and now.
Sorry, Bubs.
Shame ain't worth
as much as you think.
Let it go.
He said he wanted people to know there'd
be 12 bodies before he's finished.
He said, "I came to take 12."
I said, "what happens after 12?"
He said,
"I go somewhere else."
I asked him about the bite marks.
He said that they wanted him to bite,
that they asked for that.
He complained that the article
made him sound like a pervert.
I asked him if he was
angry at the men.
He hung up.
He called you on your cellphone?
Why didn't he call the paper?
I was all over the city yesterday
handing my cards out to homeless men.
He probably got the number from a card.
Shit, I might'a handed him a card.
I think this is the guy. I mean,{\ detective,}
a chill ran down my back.
There's no way to know.
If it's {\one other}another nut, we're gonna look
like fools if we print any of this.{\run any of this in print.}
Your cellphone caught the number?
He dialed you.
I dialed it back. Payphone
on south Hanover near West street.
- What did he sound like?
- What do you mean?
You talk to people for a living.
Did he sound black, white?
Younger, older?
High-pitched voice or low?
He sounded, to me, like a white guy.
Not a deep voice, but calm,
almost monotone.
He sounded older,
I would say,
40s.
Not a real young guy.
- Can I have your notebook?
- You can't have his notes.
As this isn't a confidential source,
we won't invoke the Maryland shield law,
But he'll type up a copy
and give them to you.
But the actual document
is property of the "Baltimore Sun."
So type it up, like now.
So, you're saying
this could be the killer.
Can we talk off-the-record?
The homicide unit
received a phone call this morning
from a payphone
from the same neighborhood,
and based on Scott's voice description,
and the use of the number 12,
Well, let's just say we need to find
whoever it was made both those calls.
He made another call?
Detective, as a newsman,
I'm inclined to include
these details in our coverage
if there's a credible chance the killer
was really in contact with our reporter.
Would doing so have any negative
effect on your investigation?
Actually, these calls
are our best means of finding this guy.
Every call he makes, every word
he says-- To you and to us--
Can only provide information.
- If we do run a story--
- {\But }You can't say he's contacting police.
You can't print that part of it
under any circumstances.
OK, then how do we characterize
what the police think
about this call to Scott?
You can say that we're...
taking it seriously.
Going forward, is it possible that
you would grant
a one-party consent for us to...
monitor your reporter's
cellphone and office phones?
- Absolutely not.
- I'm sorry, detective,
but our ability to report is dependent
upon our maintaining the confidentiality
of our conversations.
Now, we're perfect willing
to share with you the information
that this individual has as he's
definitely not a confidential source.
But we're not going to consent
to the Baltimore police department
monitoring our phones.
- You'll tap the payphone, I guess.
- Don't print that either.
Don't print anything about
where the killer calls from.
He'll change up.
Well, I'll type up my notes quick.
Big story for you guys, huh?
Well, 10 minutes ago I'd'a said
this whole thing was complete bullshit.
Shows what I know, I guess.
<i>... which is why
I'm going to fight this thing.</i>
<i>I am innocent and I have done
nothing except serve the people.</i>
<i>Oh, I believe you, Senator.</i>
<i>I've seen all the good work
you've done for the community.</i>
<i>You definitely have my sup...</i>
That's Eddie Cantor, right?
No.
It's perfect.
McNulty, it's perfect.
I couldn't believe it.
I'm sitting there.
All this bullshit coming at me,
thinking,
Christ, this is a waste of time.
Then I realized:
this is the wiretap.
Right here.
They're giving it to me.
Never mind me
making a crank call to someone.
This right here is Lester Freamon's
motherfucking wire.
What if they check this?
How many guys in this unit
have ever hooked up a wiretap?
They don't know
which wire goes where.
Explain it to me again,
because I tell ya,
I think I'm a smart guy,
but this shit makes my head hurt.
They think they're up
on your killer's cellphone,
but they'll never catch
a call because this...
...goes nowhere.
And meanwhile, using the same
court authorization,
I'm up on the live wire
down at the detail office,
Listening to Marlo.
Every day,
you file office and court reports
saying there's been no further
contacwith the serial killer.
I file exactly nothing,
but use what I hear
to rig the case on our real target.
- And when it goes to court...
- there's no mention of a wiretap.
- It's all based on a C.I.
- There it is.
4 copies signed by the judge.
Emergency order
for telephonic intercept
of a cellphone, number 915-0909.
If the machine is rigged,
you're good to go.
- You're up.
- Good hunting.
- Holley?
- Yo!
You got midnight shift.
Worden'll be in
to relieve you at 6:00.
After Worden, my squad will pick
up monitoring on the dayshift.
Excuse me.
Don't look so pissy.
We're actually
paying overtime for this.
O-Dog!
My leg!
Stay the fuck down!
What the...
Damn.
What the...
Il est bien quelque part. On continue ?
Agent Smith, madame.
Un homme a attaqué une femme
hier soir
à la résidence Esplanda, derrière vous.
- Rien entendu d'anormal ?
- Non, désolée.
Mon Dieu, c'est horrible.
La femme n'a rien ?
- La femme, elle n'a rien ?
- Ouais.
Elle va bien.
Excusez-moi.
Mon frère Omar Little est arrivé
cette nuit. Il a chuté d'une fenêtre.
Personne sous ce nom-là.
Devait être défoncé,
et a mal prononcé son nom.
La peau très foncée, avec une cicatrice.
Les jambes sûrement pétées.
Pas de blessé de ce type cette nuit.
Que dalle.
On a fait toutes les poubelles, bennes
et maisons vides sur 3 pâtés.
- Rien.
- Même les égouts.
Marlo veut qu'on se voie.
Tu veux qu'on fasse quoi ?
Lequel ?
Ça a pas l'air possible.
Non.
C'est un truc à la Spiderman, ça.
On a raté notre coup.
Maintenant, il va être après nous.

{\c&HFFFFFF&}<b>THE DICKENSIAN ASPECT</b>
{\c&HFFFFFF&}"Si ça te pose un problème,
je comprends parfaitement." - Freamon
D'habitude, mon équipe
me met à l'abri des objets tranchants.
Tout a commencé avec Charles Center
et Tommy d'Alesandro.
Cela a continué avec
William Donald Schaefer et Harborplace.
Puis les maires Schmoke et O'Malley,
avec Inner Harbor Est.
C'est au tour de mon administration
de revendiquer le bras central
du Patapsco, qui sera bientôt connu
sous le nom de New Westport,
revitalisant un autre bord de mer
de notre grande ville.
Merci.
Adieu,
Locust Point Sud.
- Va te faire foutre, Krawczyk.
- Ouais. Va te faire foutre.
Enculé de rapace.
Enculé qui démolit le port de Baltimore
pour le vendre à des connards
de yuppies de Washington !
- C'est qui, bon sang ?
- Personne, M. le Maire.
Ce n'est personne.
<i>Un tueur en série
s'en prend aux sans-abri de la ville</i>
Content, mon salaud ?
Je suis satisfait, oui.
- T'as appelé le journaliste, hein ?
- En fait, non.
Ce con fabrique son propre truc.
Les chefs ont prévu une conférence
de presse cet après-midi.
Y aura tellement de fric
pour mon histoire, ta tête va tourner.
Quels dossiers ?
Les cadavres des maisons vacantes.
Il manque des analyses du labo.
Mais y a du beau boulot sur certains.
Tu sais quoi, Jimmy ?
Je vais retravailler
chacun des meurtres.
Reprendre à zéro.
Et pourquoi ?
Parce que je suis un flic de la Crim.
Je bosse sur des meurtres.
J'invente pas d'histoires, je me fous
de personne. J'ai un meurtre, j'enquête.
Je fais comme je suis censé faire.
Dis-moi si tu as besoin
de quelque chose, d'accord ?
Voiture, heures sup' ou analyses...
Ce que tu veux.
Car, dans 3 heures ou 4 heures,
l'argent va couler, pour mon enquête.
Ce que tu veux, Bunk. J'aurai
sans doute plus que Lester aura besoin.
Si proche d'un tueur en série,
ça doit être bizarre.
Un peu, oui.
Superbe article, Scott.
Oui, enfin, c'est venu comme ça.
C'est une chance qu'il m'ait appelé.
Pas seulement,
c'est venu en battant le pavé,
en allant là d'où vient l'histoire.
- Qu'avez-vous pour demain ?
- Demain ?
On ne peut oublier ça
après un ou deux jours.
J'envisage de passer une nuit
parmi les SDF.
Se mettre à leur place,
un truc dans le genre.
Ça sera pendant la nuit,
j'aurai rien avant après-demain.
Excellent.
Ça pourrait être la suite idéale.
J'en parle à Gus.
On a aussi reçu des appels
des chaînes nationales et du câble.
- Ils veulent vous interviewer.
- Moi ? À la télé ?
Si vous pouvez faire les nationales
de manière responsable.
Bien sûr.
Mais ça ne me met pas très à l'aise
d'être au centre de l'histoire.
Mais il y a moyen de gérer ça
de façon responsable.
Pensez que vous représentez le <i>Sun</i>.
L'heure de gloire.
C'est quelque chose, hein ?
- Le sans-abrisme ?
- Notre couverture
devrait refléter
l'aspect dickensien des sans-abri.
L'élément humain.
Scott commencera. Il passera une nuit
dans la rue, écrira de ce point de vue.
Scott ? Il mène déjà votre étude
sur l'éducation. Faudrait le remettre...
Je ne vois pas l'étude sur l'école
produire le même impact
que notre regard sur le sans-abrisme.
Ces meurtres, le coup de téléphone
à notre journaliste...
Cela ouvre le problème, non ?
- Oui, mais...
- D'ici la fin de l'année,
consacrons-nous
non seulement aux meurtres,
mais sur la nature du sans-abrisme
en lui-même.
L'aspect dickensien, je vois.
Je suis arrivé à un point,
inspecteur Sydnor,
où je n'ai plus le temps ni la patience
de me mettre au service du système
dans lequel nous oeuvrons.
Je suis las.
- Tu vas démissionner ?
- Pas encore, pas tout de suite.
De quoi tu parles, alors ?
Quand ils ont arrêté l'enquête
sur Marlo, la dernière fois,
qu'ils ont dit ne plus pouvoir financer
le prolongement de l'enquête...
j'ai estimé cette décision illégitime.
- Illégitime ?
- Ainsi, je fais de même.
Je vais monter un dossier
contre Marlo Stanfield
sans tenir compte
des règles habituelles.
J'ai une écoute illégale
sur le portable de Marlo Stanfield.
- Putain, Lester.
- Si ça te pose un problème,
je comprends parfaitement,
et je te conseille vivement
de partir aussi loin que possible d'ici.
Vous vous souvenez de celui-là ?
J'ai renoncé à forcer le gosse,
par respect
pour ce branque de Pryzbylewski.
Qu'aurait à me dire le jeune homme
un an plus tard, hein ?
Bunk.
C'est quoi, ce truc ?
Vernon a fouillé le magasin
de son type assassiné,
ça vient des tiroirs du bureau.
- Documents de grand jury ?
- Transcriptions, mises en examen.
- Qui c'était ?
- Dealer de l'Est, Joe Stewart.
Une balle dans la tête, l'autre nuit.
Quelqu'un a fini
par se faire Prop Joe, hein ?
L'année dernière,
les stups inculpaient Charlie Burman.
L'enculé s'était barré deux jours
avant la rafle. Toujours en fuite.
Les mises en examen sont là.
Toutes.
De qui se méfie-t-on au tribunal ?
- <i>Mettent du fromage sur les frites ?</i>
- <i>Oui. Du chili aussi.</i>
<i>OK.</i>
- <i>Une boisson ?</i>
- <i>Limonade à la fraise.</i>
- <i>OK.</i>
- Ils reprennent
- les portables après plus d'un an ?
- Eh oui.
Dis-moi que c'est codé, Lester.
Je veux pas risquer la taule si on chope
que ses commandes de bouffe.
J'ai flairé aucun code.
J'ai une dizaine d'appels, tous normaux.
Rien sur la drogue,
pas de nombres, pas d'heures.
Rien de suspect.
Donc, il dit rien au téléphone.
Alors arrête ce délire. Foutons le camp.
J'ai aussi cinq appels,
de 30 secondes à 40 secondes,
chacun décroché
à la première sonnerie,
et pas de conversation
d'un côté ou de l'autre.
Tu saisis ? Quand ils parlent,
y a rien d'important.
Mais il y a des appels
où ils ne se disent rien.
30 secondes sans conversation.
Est-il...
- On en a parlé. Il sait les risques.
- J'en suis.
Si c'est déterminant, j'en suis à fond.
Du nouveau ? Ils parlent affaires ?
- Non.
- Lester, putain !
Marlo ne parlera pas affaires
au téléphone,
mais il y a un truc
que j'ai pas encore compris.
Il nous faudrait plus d'effectifs.
Deux équipes de surveillance pour voir
- leur utilisation des portables.
- T'as vu le journal ?
Avec un tel titre,
les chefs vont allouer de l'argent
pour les meurtres de SDF.
Une fois fait,
je t'enverrai deux inspecteurs.
Les meurtres de SDF ?
Quel est le rapport
entre les deux affaires ?
Difficile à expliquer.
Vous vous souvenez
ce qu'a dit le parti il y a 2 ans
pour devenir gouverneur ?
Construire quelque chose
et y mettre ton nom,
faire baisser le crime
et ne pas toucher aux écoles.
- Et garder mon air de beau garçon.
- Un sur quatre, c'est pas mal.
Bon Dieu.
C'était obligé de faire ça
le même jour que New Westport ?
Ma bonne nouvelle fera même pas
la une des pages locales.
La coupe du ruban était prévue
depuis 2 semaines.
Cette affaire de SDF,
personne ne l'a vue venir.
Tout d'abord, je suis surpris
de voir autant de media.
Un peu plus tôt aujourd'hui,
l'annonce de la revitalisation
d'une autre partie de la ville
n'a pas attiré autant de monde.
Les media ne semblent prêter attention
qu'aux faits négatifs à Baltimore
et ferment les yeux
sur les progrès réalisés.
Magré tout, je suis content de vous voir
aussi nombreux. Certains représentant
pas seulement nos media locaux
mais aussi l'attention nationale.
Merci de vous inquiéter
de nos plus vulnérables citoyens
en vous impliquant dans ce drame.
Nos citoyens sans-abri, qui ont sombré
dans les failles de notre société,
qui ne reçoivent que le minimum
de nos attentions et efforts,
ils n'attirent sans doute
que peu de vigilance des politiciens.
La plupart ne votent pas,
ils ne contribuent pas aux campagnes,
ils payent peu d'impôts,
et quand notre gouvernement
est au courant de leur existence,
il tente de minimiser les dégâts
causés par leur présence.
On ouvre une banque alimentaire par-ci,
un refuge par-là.
On les éloigne du centre-ville,
de nos parties communes,
de nos écoles, de nos maisons.
Si on devait juger notre société
par la façon dont on traite ces démunis,
nous aurions de quoi avoir honte.
Moi, j'ai honte, Dieu me pardonne,
un politicien.
Mais j'ai également intégré
la fonction publique, car je crois
à une autre façon de gouverner,
et qu'au bout du compte,
on ne sera pas jugé pour ce qu'on aura
apporté à nos électeurs,
nos contributeurs de campagne
ou nos contribuables.
Je crois qu'on sera jugé pour
ce qu'on aura apporté aux plus démunis.
C'est cela, l'épreuve.
C'est cela, mon épreuve.
Une personne tue les hommes sans-abri
dans cette ville.
Elle ôte la vie de concitoyens
qui n'ont pas les moyens ou la force
de se défendre comme il faut.
Elle sera arrêtée.
Nous ferons tout notre possible
pour cela.
Vous avez ma parole.
Merci, M. le Maire.
- Quelle mouche t'a piqué ?
- Quoi ?
Je veux vous assurer
que nous faisons le maximum
pour capturer cet individu.
Nos inspecteurs
travaillent sans relâche.
Nos agents de district sont en contact
avec les organismes
qui travaillent avec les sans-abri.
Je ne peux entrer
dans les détails de l'enquête,
mais, avertissement prononcé,
je répondrai aux questions.
M. le préfet,
y a-t-il des liens avec les meurtres
des maisons vacantes l'année dernière ?
Aucun lien.
Avez-vous demandé l'aide du FBI
pour l'enquête ?
Je pense que le préfet adjoint Daniels
est en position de détailler là-dessus.
Toute aide est la bienvenue.
Nos inspecteurs travailleront de près
avec l'unité d'analyse comportementale
de Quantico.
Même avec les ressources
dont vous disposez,
n'est-ce pas hautement difficile
d'attraper un tueur en série ?
La maîtrise du matériel génétique
et la banque croissante d'ADN
ne nous étaient pas accessibles
il y a quelques années.
La gestion des ressources
est plus efficace
grâce à des logiciels sophistiqués.
Et nous avons parmi les meilleurs
enquêteurs criminels du pays.
Comme le maire l'a dit formellement
il y a peu,
ceci est devenu une priorité
pour la police.
Un message a été laissé ?
Je ne peux fournir aucun détail
sur l'enquête à l'heure qu'il est.
Je reste ?
Il t'a dit qui je suis, non ?
Fiston, le truc concernant les meurtres,
c'est qu'on ne les oublie jamais.
On enquête pendant des semaines,
des mois, des années.
Jusqu'à ce qu'enfin,
quelqu'un décide qu'il en a eu assez,
jusqu'à ce qu'on obtienne ce qu'il faut
de la bonne personne.
Tu sais ce qui se passe après ?
Quand une affaire est jugée,
tous ceux qui n'ont rien dit,
qui ont menti,
qui pensaient pas
que ça leur retomberait dessus,
ils finissent par être inculpés
et passent des années
derrière les barreaux.
Des années, hein ?
Vous allez m'en coller ?
Si tu sais un truc sur ce Lex
qui a été buté,
c'est ta dernière chance d'en parler.
L'an dernier, tu as dit...
Vous me promettez pas
de me faire sortir d'ici ?
C'est votre truc,
mentir aux débiles de renois.
Yo, faites-moi sortir ce flic
avant que je botte son derche.
Vous êtes né pour ça.
Ils vous mangeaient dans la main.
Je suivais les ordres du maire.
Mettre les bouchées doubles, non ?
Un ou deux inspecteurs de plus
et davantage de patrouilles
où les clochards se rassemblent.
Mais au-delà, M. l'adjoint,
les placards sont vides.
- Mais Carcetti...
- Comprenez bien.
Il veut qu'on élucide les meurtres,
mais sans dépenser.
Faites pas cette tête.
C'est la cour des grands, ici.
Le portable du tueur,
c'est pas suffisant ?
Je pensais que vous pourriez
le pister par GPS.
Il utilise un jetable.
Et on le soupçonne
d'enlever la batterie entre les appels.
Et rien ne l'empêche
de changer de téléphone,
pour appeler d'un autre numéro.
Vous voulez aussi sonoriser
le téléphone du journaliste ?
Il en va de soi
qu'il faut surveiller les deux.
- On ferait ça en temps normal.
- Rien de tout ça n'est normal.
Le téléphone d'un journaliste
du <i>Baltimore Sun</i> est problématique.
Il faut trouver le juste milieu
entre vos besoins d'enquêteurs
et les droits du 1er amendement
du <i>Sun</i> et ses sources.
Le 1er amendement ne garantit pas
la confidentialité, Votre Honneur.
- Un précédent légal indique...
- Ce n'est pas
- impossible, mais...
- Mais quoi ?
Tant qu'on ne pense pas
que votre suspect change de téléphones,
je ne suis pas enclin à être partisan
d'une mise sur écoute
des communications du <i>Baltimore Sun</i>.
Peur de les énerver ?
Ne jamais se battre contre ceux
qui achètent l'encre par palettes.
Bon Dieu.
Très bien, M. le juge.
Combien d'ennemis te faut-il ?
M. l'adjoint.
- D'où ça vient ?
- Chérie, tu ne veux pas savoir.
T'as du neuf ?
Tu ressors les 22 meurtres, hein ?
- Tout bosser à la fois.
- J'essaie sous un nouvel oeil.
25.
Mon triple.
Marlo et ses hommes sont derrière.
C'est sûr ?
Un bon indic me l'a dit.
Une des victimes disait du mal
de M. Stanfield,
qui l'a pris personnellement,
le tuant avec sa copine et son garde.
Sauf les gosses.
Il doit pas être si mauvais.
Les gens ont tellement peur
de cet enculé
qu'aucun témoin ne veut témoigner.
Où t'en es dans ces enquêtes ?
On a même pas d'analyses
pour 14 des cadavres.
Un an plus tard, je fais encore
des demandes à Landsman
qui les met direct dans son tiroir.
- McNulty aurait appelé un journaliste.
- Je ne suis pas lui.
Que ferait le Bunk ?
Lâcher l'affaire ?
On a été réduits.
Vous le savez bien.
On a perdu 3 de nos 4 examinateurs.
Perdu la moitié de nos employés.
Le congélo a sauté,
4 mois d'échantillons sanguins fichus.
4 mois de preuves.
Et toujours pas de nouveau frigo.
J'ai le coeur qui pisse pour toi.
J'ai le plus grand massacre
de l'histoire de B-more,
et aucune analyse au bout d'un an ?
Sérieux, Ron !
Vous pouvez pas en parler à la presse.
Des têtes tomberaient
si ça se savait.
C'est la faute de personne.
- En fait, c'est un peu la vôtre.
- Qu'est-ce tu racontes ?
Après le départ en retraite d'Annette,
les preuves se sont accumulées
plus que jamais.
Il nous fallait un assistant de labo,
mais avec les réductions,
on a eu qu'une intérimaire.
- Une intérimaire ?
- Oui.
Sans assurance maladie, sans pension.
Une intérimaire pour nous aider
pendant un temps. Venez.
Je vais vous montrer un truc.
Elle devait trier et classer
les oligo-éléments des individus.
Des cheveux, des fibres surtout.
Vous savez,
venant des 14 scènes de crime.
- Quel est le problème ?
- Initialement,
vous avez écrit les numéros
des 22 motifs de consultation.
- Oui.
- Mais dans les demandes annexes,
tu as tout mis sous les initiales MdC
suivies de "et al".
- Tu te rappelles ?
- Et ?
Elle ignorait ce que "et al" signifiait.
Elle a tout rangé
sous le même numéro de consultation.
- Nous dites pas...
- Si.
On a aucune idée de quelle scène
chacun de ces trucs proviennent.
Même pas une piste.
En fait,
à part ça,
c'est plutôt une bonne employée.
- Des équipes de surveillance.
- 12 h de service chacune.
Installées sur des lieux notoires.
- Le maire l'a dit. C'est une priorité.
- Ça l'est.
Prends Greggs, si tu veux.
La dernière fois,
tu l'as renvoyée sur son enquête.
Un inspecteur de plus,
ou tu restes seul.
- C'est que des conneries.
- Je sais pas.
Le discours du maire était très bon.
Il m'a ému.
Tout comme ton commentaire,
à l'instant.
- Je vais te dire un truc.
- Quoi ?
L'enculé qui a l'assos,
c'est lui qui s'est fait Joe.
C'est sûr.
Vous savez que la coop a été touchée.
Joe. Le Morfal.
Des gars bien, surtout Joe.
Leur mort fut de sang-froid.
Je sais à quoi vous pensez,
alors je vais pas le cacher.
J'en suis responsable.
Y a une semaine, je me suis lancé
sur Omar, avec l'accord de Joe.
Ce pédé a pas eu le cran de m'attaquer,
alors il s'est attaqué à mes proches.
Maintenant, je double la mise.
100 plaques
pour un bout de ce suceur de bite.
250 pour sa tête.
- Et l'assos ?
- Je m'en suis chargé.
Et de ce fait, je prends sur moi
pour diriger cette réunion.
Je le savais.
Slim,
je veux que tu prennes
la part du gâteau du Morfal.
Sans manquer de respect,
je suis pas fait pour diriger.
- Cheese, alors.
- Pas de problème. Je m'en charge.
Tant qu'on a pas fini avec Omar,
il vaut mieux suspendre ces réunions.
En fait, ça me dit rien, les réunions.
Si vous avez un problème,
dites-le-moi ou fermez-la.
Ceux de l'Ouest,
pour un réappro,
appelez Monk.
Il s'occupera du ravitaillement.
Pour l'Est,
Cheese. Dernière chose.
Prix du paquet augmente.
30 de plus.
Bon. On a fini avec cette merde.
Quoi ?
L'année prochaine, les écoles.
Jusqu'à décembre,
on est sur le problème
des sans-abri.
Le maître Whiting a parlé.
J'ai vu Klebanow, il y a 30 minutes,
mais il ne veut pas. Désolé.
Regardez, notre service métro
passe à la télé nationale.
<i>Nous sommes prudents

T'aurais vu Phelan, ce matin.
Trop peur de sonoriser
les téls du journal
de peur de se faire incendier par eux.
Putain de juge politicard.
Pourquoi vouloir plus d'écoutes ?
On a tout ce qu'il faut.
J'en veux pas.
C'est le principe de la chose.
Ça m'énerve de l'entendre parler.
Pas de voitures de surveillance.
Ils me donnent que Greggs.
Toi et Sydnor allez devoir faire
de votre mieux pour le moment.
Des enfoirés.
Il leur faut un autre cadavre, hein ?
J'appelle notre gars du district Sud.
C'est bon. Vous pouvez vous casser.
D'accord, patron.
Comment va, Rick ?
Comme au bon vieux temps, hein ?
Prends tout ce que tu veux.
Ce soir, je prends juste ton pétard...
- et te laisse un petit quelque chose.
- Quoi ?
Ma parole à transmettre.
Je traite Marlo de vraie pute.
Il y a pas de mérite
à descendre un aveugle.
Et pour ce qui est de se confronter
à moi, dis-lui qu'il a pas le cran.
D'accord.
Dis-lui que je suis dans la rue,
à l'attendre.
Et comme une petite pute, il se cache.
Je lui dirai. Promis.
Ramasse tes clés et entre, yo.
T'as tué Joe ? Morfal ?
Je m'en doutais.
Et maintenant ?
Il y a plus d'une façon
d'éplucher un dossier.
Tu as déjà vérifié leurs antécédents ?
Les antécédents, oui.
Mais je vais rechercher
tous les noms que vous avez écrits.
Pas seulement les antécédents,
tout ce qu'on a d'enregistré.
Comparution au tribunal,
liberté conditionnelle, surveillée,
permis de port d'arme,
détention, libération sous caution.
- Enquête de fond, hein ?
- Chérie,
je joue avec les cartes
qu'on m'a données.
Une enquête pour homicide ?
- Qui a pris l'affaire ?
- Worden. D'une autre équipe.
Beau-père. Battu à mort.
Ils ont interrogé la mère,
mais personne d'autre du ménage.
Ça ressemble pas trop
aux autres, hein ?
Une bonne dérouillée dans une allée,
- ça ressemble pas à Marlo Stanfield.
- Non, en effet.
Mais tu vas quand même y travailler.
Dans l'Église pentecôtiste où j'ai
appris la religion, d'aucun aurait dit
- que l'Esprit Saint était en toi hier.
- Ça m'a fait du bien.
- Loué soit-il.
- Ça m'a énervé qu'en plus de tout,
je doive gérer un taré
qui se met à tuer des sans-abri.
- Ces bols de merde, y en a combien ?
- Mais il a raison, tu as assuré.
Cette passion était ce qu'il fallait.
- Vous croyez...
- En réglant ce problème,
- on peut passer à un niveau national.
- Le Gouverneur a bien supprimé
les programmes d'urgence médicale
et du logement l'an dernier ?
Comment, déjà ? TEMHA.
Remplacé par TDAP,
supprimant les allocations de ceux
qui ne remplissent pas
les conditions fédérales.
Pire, il a forcé le rejet
des nouvelles demandes,
ce qui a mis un paquet de gens à la rue.
On descend le républicain
pour avoir enfoncé les pauvres.
Ça marcherait. Tu prends nationalement
la défense des laissés pour compte.
Et le sans-abrisme
est une cause acquise.
Dans cet État, tu t'en prends au type
qui a déchiré le filet de protection.
Le sans-abrisme.
Ça alors.
Base à 2306.
<i>Vas-y, Lester.</i>
Tu vois quelqu'un
téléphoner avec un portable ?
<i>Attends.</i>
<i>Négatif.</i>
Ne bouge pas.
Y a quelqu'un.
Lester ?
Je ne m'habituerai pas
à voir cet endroit si vide.
Vrai, mais vous seriez surprise
de ce qu'on peut faire
quand personne ne regarde
par-dessus votre épaule.
Vous devez les notifier.
Nous n'avons plus beaucoup de temps.
Je m'en occupe.
Il y a quelques flous
que l'on devrait préciser aussi.
- Maintenant ?
- Quand, alors ?
Le début du procès arrive à grands pas.
Exact. Mais c'est que...
J'ai dit quelque chose ?
Non, c'est que...
Sydnor va amener un informateur.
- Et si vous êtes là...
- Oh, merde.
Je suis désolée.
- Je vous laisse ma liste, d'accord ?
- Pas de problème.
On s'en occupe de suite.
Je suis désolée, Lester,
si j'ai été intrusive.
Vous ne pouviez pas savoir.
Pourquoi vous êtes là ?
Si c'est pour Michael, je vous le dis
direct, il habite plus ici.
En fait, je poursuis
l'enquête sur votre homme.
Vous avez parlé à l'inspecteur Worden
quand c'est arrivé.
- C'était votre petit ami, c'est ça ?
- Quand il était pas en prison.
Le père de mon dernier.
Mais vous savez comment il est mort.
Méchamment battu.
Crime passionnel, comme on dit.
Il n'était pas rentré
depuis assez longtemps
pour agacer quelqu'un à ce point.
À moins, bien sûr,
que ce soit à cause de vous.
Tu crois que j'sais quequ'chose ?
Jouons cartes sur table.
Ça fait longtemps que je fais ce métier,
et il m'a appris une chose :
un meurtre comme celui-ci,
il est toujours lié à une femme.
Je sais rien.
Je sens que c'est faux.
Et je vais vous dire.
On va faire un tour en centrale,
vous parlerez au grand jury.
Si vous leur mentez,
ils vous colleront
une ordonnance sur témoin de fait.
Vous habiterez le centre de détention
pour femmes quelques semaines.
C'est incroyable
comment ça aide à faire son deuil.
- Prenez vos affaires.
- Je bouge pas de là.
Moi ou le panier.
Inspecteur, je vous jure,
j'y suis pour rien.
C'est pas à moi qu'il faut demander.
C'est au garçon. Lui, il sait.
Il bosse avec les coupables.
C'est pour vous débarrasser de moi.
Non, faut me croire.
Il m'a dit que Devar rentrerait pas
avant même qu'on apprenne sa mort.
Vous avez dit qu'il bosse avec eux.
Avec qui ?
Chris, Snoop, tous ces gangsters.
Qui d'autre bute les gens par ici ?
Montre-moi ton appareil photo.
Avance-la d'une minute six.
Ça marche.
Tiens. Regarde.
Une seule sonnerie. Connexion. Silence.
Qu'est-ce que tu as ?
J'ai pris ces trois-là.
Ils font que traîner.
À quelle heure Monk est parti ?
13 h 24. Deux minutes après.
Ce n'est pas ce que Marlo dit,
c'est ce qu'il envoie.
Regarde bien Monk.
- Oui. Message texte.
- Texte ?
Dois-je rappeler, inspecteur,
que ces jeunes gens
viennent des écoles de Baltimore ?
Et regarde
comme il tient son téléphone.
Trop éloigné pour lire du texte.
Nan, fils. Des images.
Des images...
Qu'est-ce t'as à me regarder ?
Tu sais comment ils font, hein ?
Ils te narguent.
Ils te laissent t'approcher. Et juste
au moment de boucler l'enquête,
ils tirent le putain de tapis
de sous tes pieds.
Je mens pas. On a un putain de tueur
en série dans la nature.
Tu le savais pas ?
C'est dans le canard.
À quelle aide j'ai droit ?
Un seul putain d'inspecteur.
Ils veulent jouer aux cons, très bien.
Mais je ferai ce que j'ai à faire.
Pardon.
Ouais, Oscar.
Magnifique.
Bien sûr. Où ?
Je suis en route.
Mec, faut pas te fécho comme aç.
Pourquoi on va pas acheter des jouets
pour les porter à tes gosses ?
T'écoutes pas.
Comment aller voir ma famille
avec Omar sur nous ?
Comment il saurait, pour eux ?
Comment on a su, pour l'aveugle ?
Omar, yo !
Dégage !
Toi aussi, petit.
L'argent est en retard aujourd'hui.
La chevrotine dans ta jambe t'aidera
à expliquer ce qui t'est arrivé
à Marlo.
Pour les deux autres, ils vont
regretter de pas avoir été criblés.
N'oublie pas de dire à Marlo
que j'ai brûlé l'argent.
C'est pas pour le fric.
C'est pour blesser ses gars,
lui pourrir la vie.
Dis à ce gamin qu'un homme, un vrai,
viendrait voir Omar dans la rue.
Dis-lui bien ça !
Mon sergent et deux collègues
sont arrivés avant moi.
Puis le chef d'équipe s'est pointé.
Et l'officier de garde est en route.
Pour une mort à l'arrivée ?
Toi et Lester, vous avez démarré
un sacré truc, fiston.
Maintenant, une MAA
rameute tout le monde en un instant.
Que Dieu vous garde.
Des images ?
Des photos sur téléphones portables.
Donc, il faut un nouveau motif
raisonnable pour capter les photos
et un nouvel appareil pour le faire.
Comment je fais passer ça dans le mode
opératoire de mon faux tueur de SDF ?
Quand on a commencé, tu as dit
que quelques micros suffiraient,
une caméra ou deux, et en 2 semaines,
on les aurait. C'est ce que tu as dit.
J'ai fait monter la sauce pour payer ça,
mais non, il te fallait aussi
une écoute.
Je me suis arrangé pour te l'avoir.
Et là, tu as demandé
des équipes de surveillance.
Mais avant d'en arriver là,
tu me présentes ce truc.
Mais putain, quoi.
Je dois te dire, Lester,
je veux pas te vexer,
mais je vois pourquoi Daniels
s'écrasait chaque fois que tu l'ouvrais.
T'es un cauchemar de chef.
Je ne fais que démêler l'écheveau.
Disons qu'on t'obtienne l'interception
des images, ça nous donne Marlo ?
Ce sera codé, probablement,
mais on pourra le déchiffrer.
Ça nous dira de quelle façon
ils travaillent, et d'habitude,
c'est suffisant. Ou pas.
Mais la vérité est que j'éreinte
Sydnor à surveiller
deux ou trois racailles et leurs appels.
Quand on aura leur code, il nous faudra
plus d'hommes pour taper une planque
ou un réappro. On peut pas tout faire.
Je ne peux plus truquer le jeu
davantage.
Cette nuit, la moitié de la police
était sur la scène de crime d'Oscar
avant que j'arrive.
On fabriquera pas d'autre meurtre.
Merci pour le lait.
Qu'est-ce qu'un donut sans lait ?
Alors, vous parliez
de votre deuxième service.
Celui qui s'est mal passé, oui.
Le 2e service m'a bien niqué.
Mais ils veulent pas l'entendre.
Qui ça ?
Principalement le commandement
et les hauts officiers médicaux.
Ils ont couché que les marines n'ont pas
de névrose traumatique. Mais si.
Vous me racontez ?
Terry, vous pouvez en parler ?
Il nous restait un mois.
On était en mission de sécurisation
près de Fallujah.
J'étais l'adjoint au chef d'équipe.
Nos M998 avaient un blindage renforcé.
M998 ?
Un Humvee.
Désolé. Ils adorent la nomenclature.
Bref, on avait fini notre ratissage,
on rentrait. R.A.S.
Puis boom.
Notre véhicule de tête a été touché
par un EEI surélevé.
L'explosion a déchiqueté
l'artilleur du M50,
retourné le Humvee
telle une voiture Matchbox.
Le conducteur a perdu ses deux mains.
Il pisse le sang. Mais il se marre,
répétant :
"Regarde, maman, plus de mains."
C'est du rire
dont j'arrive pas à me défaire.
Trop chelou.
Car il va bien. Il va mieux que moi.
Il a eu deux paluches prosthétiques.
80 000 pièce.
Et après ?
Pas grand-chose.
On s'est dégagés,
on a sécurisé le périmètre.
Le toubib faisait ce qu'il pouvait.
On attendait l'évacuation.
Je ne cherche pas à chier
sur la copie d'un autre.
Sache seulement qu'on en parle.
Réunion de quartier à Belair-Edison
pour le découpage scolaire.
Une femme me soûle avec ça.
Elle dit que les enfants
n'ont pas touché un centime.
Enfin, j'espère que tout ça,
c'est des conneries.
- Ça se présente bien ?
- Oui.
- Tu as vu la photo ?
- Oui, c'est du bon. Écoute.
On a reçu une plainte sur un article
à toi d'il y a 2 semaines.
La femme morte d'une réaction
allergique aux produits de mer.
Tu te souviens ?
Une dame du quartier connaît
sa soeur. Notre article aurait amené
beaucoup d'argent aux enfants.
- Grâce à la bourse d'études.
- Oui, et ?
Elle dit que la soeur a déjà été
condamnée pour détournement.
L'argent aurait fini dans les casinos
et les enfants n'auraient rien touché.
- Putain, mais qui...
- Je sais.
C'est sûrement une de ces vieilles
qui parle sans savoir,
mais tu devrais aller vérifier
auprès de la famille,
qu'on se fasse pas avoir, hein ?
Non. Pas tout de suite.
Quand t'auras fini.
Deux-trois coups de fil, hein ?
- C'est de l'enlèvement.
- À vrai dire, j'en suis pas sûr.
Je lui ai demandé s'il voulait 100 $
pour aller parler autour d'une assiette.
- Il est venu à ma voiture.
- Tu lui as donné le billet ?
Je lui ai mis dans sa veste.
Il a rien, Lester. Rien du tout.
- Tu crois qu'il pourra rentrer ?
- Il finira bien.
D'ici là, on en aura fini avec Marlo.
Et pour ce qui lui sera arrivé...
ils en concluront
à une blague de fraternité.
Il sait qu'on est flics ?
Même, qui le croira ?
C'est un fêlé.
- Comment tu sais qu'il est fêlé ?
- Déjà, mate-le.
C'est un malade mental.
De plus, j'ai ses médocs.
J'ai appelé le CHU.
C'est un antipsychotique.
Donc...
j'ai pris sa pièce d'identité,
je vais rayer son nom du flacon
et je lui laisse ça.
Elle appartenait au premier mort SDF
qu'Oscar nous a donné.
Celui qui était trop rigide.
Donald quelque chose ou autre.
Il l'a eue dans un refuge à Cleveland,
dans l'Ohio.
McNulty, tu mérites sérieusement
d'être examiné psychologiquement.
Ton motif raisonnable pour intercepter
des photos de portable, le voilà.
On envoie des photos de lui
avec un ruban d'un téléphone jetable
au journaliste concon avec un message
se plaignant de ses articles.
"J'suis pas un pervers", ou que sais-je.
"Maintenant,
vous trouverez plus de corps.
"Que les photos des victimes."
Avant leur disparition.
Regarde cette pauvre poire.
Ça m'étonnerait qu'on fasse ça.
S'il disparaît, la ville pète un câble.
Tu interceptes les photos, et le temps
qu'on trouve un des réappros de Marlo,
tu as tous les hommes qu'il te faut.
Et Marlo tombe.
Sévère.
Me sors pas
que c'est aussi mal étiqueté.
Je veux des comparaisons
entre les suspects connus
et l'ADN de cette scène.
À la vue de ça, y a tout plein d'ADN.
- Maintenant, enculé ! De suite !
- En haut de ma liste.
Dès qu'on a fini toutes les traces
des meurtres de SDF.
C'est la priorité, Bunk.
Les meurtres de SDF.
Tout passe après ça. Désolé.
Ton pote McNulty
a l'attention de tout le monde.
Les putains de meurtres de SDF...
Alors, c'est Larry, hein ?
OK, Larry. Tu es en bonne compagnie.
Tout ira très bien.
Tu vas aimer cet endroit. Il y fait
chaud, ils ont des lits douillets.
Et le mieux, c'est que je t'ai donné
de l'argent juste pour y entrer.
Allez, Larry.
Tout ira bien. Promis.
{\a6}{\c&HFFFFFF&}<i>Washington
PROCHAINE SORTIE</i>
Vous vous sentez d'attaque
pour plaider contre Clay vous-même ?
Ça fait un moment que vous n'avez pas
plaidé dans une affaire criminelle.
Ça envoie un message.
Commençons par notre liste de témoins.
Voyons si on peut la réduire un peu,
par égard pour la nature distraite
d'un jury de Baltimore.
D'abord,
je dois évoquer autre chose.
- Papiers de grand jury ?
- Mises en examen scellées.
Transcriptions scellées.
Des dizaines.
Trouvées dans le tiroir
d'un dealer tué par balle
à Baltimore Est.
L'adjoint aux opérations
me les a amenés.
Nous avons une fuite.
{\a6}{\c&HFFFFFF&}<i>REFUGE MUNICIPAL DE RICHMOND</i>
Et il s'est pointé
devant mon lieu de travail.
Il était désorienté.
Perdu, je crois.
Alors, je l'ai amené ici.
Donald, d'où venez-vous ?
Dites-lui, Donald.
Baltimore.
Mais il m'a dit
qu'il venait de Cleveland.
Avez-vous une pièce d'identité ?
Il est bien écrit Cleveland.
Donald, et si on vous donnait
à manger ?
Tout va bien. Venez.
C'est bon ?
C'est excellent, Gus.
C'est mélodieux.
Le petit Scotty.
Excellent papier.
Celui-ci est vraiment authentique.
- Excellent travail.
- Merci.
Ce que je préfère,
c'est que c'est pas surécrit.
Peu de couleur.
Pas d'adjectif boursouflé.
Rien que des phrases concises,
déclaratives.
- Tu laisses cet ex-marine raconter.
- Merci, Gus.
Monsieur le créneau, lis et pleure.
Et j'entends ça littéralement.
Tu as pu passer deux-trois appels,
pour la plainte ?
Oui. C'est des conneries.
J'ai parlé à des gens du quartier.
La soeur est quelqu'un de bien,
mais il y a une autre femme,
aucun lien de parenté, qui se fait
toujours arrêter pour chèques en bois.
Elle utilise le nom de la soeur
chaque fois qu'elle se fait coffrer.
Elle a déjà fait ça 3 ou 4 fois.
- Sans déconner.
- C'est dingue.
Mais la soeur est nette. Tous le disent.
Je peux faire autre chose pour lui ?
Non, c'est bon.
Mais merci de l'avoir amené.
La plupart des gens les ignorent.
Je veux seulement compléter
votre dossier.
Gotta be somewhere.
You wanna keep goin'?
Officer Smith, ma'am.
We're looking for a man
went after a woman last night
at Esplanda apartments,
the ones right behind you.
- Heard anything unusual?
- No, sorry.
Oh my God, that's terrible.
Is the woman alright?
- The woman, is she alright?
- Yeah.
Yeah, she good.
Excuse me, my brother,
Omar little, came here last night.
He fell out the damn window.
- We don't have anyone by that name.
- He was kinda,
ya know, high.
Probably messed up his name.
Real dark,
got himself a scar.
Legs should
be busted up real bad.
No one with that type
of injury came in last night.
Not a goddamn thing.
Been in every trashcan, dumpster,
vacant for three blocks 'round.
- Nothin'.
- We even checked down the sewers.
Marlo wanna meet.
So what you want us to do?
Which one?
Don't seem possible.
It don't.
That some Spiderman shit there.
We missed our shot.
Now he gonna be at us.
Usually, my staff tries to keep
sharp objects out of my hands.
You know, it all started with
Charles Center and Tommy d'Alesandro
and it continued with
William Donald Schaefer and harborplace.
And following that, there were
Mayors Schmoke and o'Malley
with inner harbor east.
Today it is my administration's turn
to lay claim to the middle branch
of the patapsco and hat will soon
become known as New Westport,
revitalizing another waterfront area
of our great city. Thank you.
Say g'bye to locust point south.
Fuck you, Krawczyk.
Fuck you,
greedhead motherfucker.
Fuck you for tearing down
the port of Baltimore
and selling it to some yuppie
assholes from Washington.
- C'mon buddy.
- This is bullshit.
Who the hell's that?
Oh that's nobody, Mr. Mayor.
It's nobody at all.
Ya happy now, bitch?
I am content, yes.
- You called the reporter, huh?
- No, actually.
That asshole's making up his own shit.
Brass called a press
conference for this afternoon.
They're gonna be shoveling
so much money at my bullshit
it'll make your head spin.
- What's with all the casework?
- Bodies from the vacants.
Some still missing lab work.
And some of them have
been worked pretty good.
You know what, Jimmy?
I'm gonna go back to the beginning
and work every one of them again.
Back to square one.
You know why?
Because I'm a murder police.
I work murders.
I don't fuck with no make-believe,
I don't jerk shit around.
I catch a murder and I work it.
Working this shit
like I'm supposed to.
Well, lemme know
if you need anything, alright?
Cars, some O.T., some lab work...
Anything you need.
Because in...
three or four hours
the money's gonna flow on my case.
Whatever you need.{\, Bunk,}
I'm probably gonna have more of it
than even Lester could use.
To be that close to a serial killer.
It must be weird.
Kinda. Yeah.
Wonderful story, Scott.
Yeah, well, it kinda wrote itself.
It's a lucky thing to have the guy
call me like he did...
It comes from you pounding the pavement.
{\, right?}That's more than luck.
That's putting yourself in the place
where the story comes to you.
- What do you have for tomorrow?
- For tomorrow?
This is not the kind of thing
we let go of after a day or two.
I...
{\you know, }I was thinking that if I spent
a night with the homeless, you know.
Did what they did. Saw what they saw.
That kind of thing.
I mean, if it's an overnight thing,
I couldn't get it for tomorrow, but
- the next day, sure...
- That's great.
That could be the perfect follow.
I'll speak to Gus.
Also, {\Scott, }we've been taking calls from{\ some}
{\of the }national networks and cable outlets.
- They're{\looking for} want you to go on-camera.
- Me?
- On television?
- I'd avoid the locals,
but if you can do the nationalstuff
in a responsible maner.
Sure, yeah. I mean I'm just not all
that comfortable having myself in the...
- center of the story like this.
- Of course not.
But there is a way of handling
this responsibly, I think.
Just remember
you're an ambassador for the paper.
Star time.
Yeah.
How 'bout that?
- Homelessness.
- Our coverage should reflect
the Dickensian aspect of the homeless.
The human element.
Scott will lead it off,
spending a night on the streets
and writing from that perspective.
He's the lead on your education project.
We need to get him back on the...
I don't see the...
The school project as yielding
the same kind of impact
as our attention to homelessness can.
These murders,
the phone call to our reporter.
It really opens up the
issue, don't you think?
- Yeah, but...
- From now til the end of the year,
let's focus not only
on covering the murders,
but on the...
The nature of homelessness itself.
The Dickensian aspect of it. Yeah.
I've reached a point, detective Sydnor,
where I no longer have
the time or patience left
to address myself to the needs
of the system within which we work.
- I'm tired.
- You're gonna quit?
Not yet. Not just yet.
So what are you talking about?
When they took us
off Marlo this last time,
when they said they couldn't pay
for further investigation...
I regarded that decision
as illegitimate.
- Illegitimate?
- And so...
I'm responding in kind.
I'm going to press a case
against Marlo Stanfield
without regard to the usual rules.
I'm running an illegal wiretap
on Marlo Stanfield's cellphone.
- Fuck, Lester.
- If you have a problem with this,
I understand completely
and urge you to get as far
fucking away from me as you can.
You remember
this one here?
Backed away from jackin' the boy up
outta respect for that goofy
motherfucker pryzbylewski.
Wonder what the young man might
tell me a year later, though...
Bunk.
What the fuck is this?
Vernon here did a search warrant
on his dead guy's appliance store,
pulled all of that
out of the desk drawer.
Grand jury shit?
Transcripts, sealed indictments...
- Who's your murder?
- Eastside dealer{\ by the name of}, Joe Stewart.
Caught one in the back
of his head the other night.
Somebody finally
touched prop Joe, huh?
You remember when narcotics
indicted Charlie Burman last year?
Motherfucker ran a couple days
before the raids, still on the wing.
The sealed indictments are all in there.
Every one of 'em.
Who don't we trust at the courthouse?
- <i>They put cheese on them fries?</i>
- <i>They can. Chili too.</i>
<i>Alright then.
You want a drink with that?</i>
- <i>Strawberry lemonade.</i>
- <i>Alright, I'm on it.</i>
They're back on cellphones.
After more than a year?
That they are.
Tell me they're
talking in code, Lester.
I wanna go to jail
for snatchin' something better
than Marlo Stanfield's
fucking lunch order.
There's no code that I can tell.
I've got a half dozen calls,
all routine. No drug talk,
no numbers, no times...
Nothing but what they seem.
So he ain't doing
business with the phone then.
So take this mess down.
Let's get the fuck outta here.
I also have five calls,
thirty to forty seconds duration,
each one picked up
on the first ring, each one
with nothing whatsoever
said between parties.
You see? When they talk,
it's bullshit.
But there are calls
where no one says a thing.
Thirty seconds, without conversation.
Is he...
We talked it through,
- he knows the risks.
- I'm in.
If it makes the fucking case,
I'm in all the way.
So, what's up now?
They talking dirt?
- No.
- Lester. Fuck.
Marlo's not gonna
talk dirt on the phone,
but there's something to this.
I just haven't figured it out.
We could use some more manpower.
We need a couple of surveillance teams
to get on these guys
to see how they using the phones.
You see the newspaper today?
Headline like that,
the bosses are gonna start
throwing money at the homeless murders.
When they do, I'll peel off a couple
detectives, throw them your way.
The homeless murders?
How does that case
tangle in with this?
Hard to explain.
Remember what the D.N.C. folks
told me two years ago?
What I needed to do to
take the statehouse?
Build something downtown
and stick your name on it,
get the crime to go down,
and stay away from schools.
And keep my boyish good looks.
One out of four ain't bad.
Jesus.
Did we have to schedule this
the same day as new Westport?
My good news isn't even going to make
the front of the local section.
The ribbon-cutting
was scheduled two weeks ago.
This homeless thing
no one saw coming.
First of all, I'm surprised
to see so much media here.
A press event held earlier today
to announce the revitalization
of yet another part of our city
was not so well attended.
It would appear that media
attention is always focusing
on the negatives
when it comes to Baltimore,
but you guys aren't around
when we're making real progress.
Nevertheless, I'm glad
to see so many of you here.
Some of you representing
not just our local media,
but national attention to this problem.
Thank you for caring enough
about our most vulnerable citizens
to address yourselves to this tragedy.
Our homeless citizens,
those who have fallen
through the cracks of our society,
those who command
the least of our attentions and efforts,
they seemingly have little
to endear themselves to politicians.
They don't vote, by and large.
They don't contribute to campaigns.
They offer little to a city's tax base,
and to the extent that our government
is made aware of their existence,
it responds by trying to mitigate
the damage done by their presence.
We open a food bank here,
a shelter there.
We try to move them away
from downtown,
away from our communal areas,
away from our schools,
away from our homes.
If you were to judge our
society by the manner in which
we treat those lost on our streets,
we would have cause to be shamed.
Well, I am, God forgive me,
a politician.
But I am also someone who ran
for public office because I believe that
there is a different way of governing.
And I believe that in the end
we will be judged
not by the efforts we make on behalf
of those who vote for us, or those
who contribute to our campaigns,
or those who provide for our tax base.
I believe that we will be
judged by what we provide
to the weakest and most vulnerable.
That is the test.
That is my test.
Somebody is killing
homeless men in this city.
They are taking the lives
of fellow citizens
who do not have the means
or the strength
to properly protect themselves.
They will be stopped.
We will do everything
in our power to stop them.
You have my word on this.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
What got into you?
- What?
- I want to assure the public
that we are doing everything possible
in our power to apprehend this subject.
Homicide detectives
are working around the clock.
District officers are in contact
with the agencies that work
with the homeless.
I cannot go into specifics
of the investigation,
but with that caveat,
I will take questions.
Commissioner,
is there any connection
1between these murders and those
in the vacant homes last year?
No connection.
Commissioner. Are you asking the F.B.I.
To join in the investigation?
I think deputy Commissioner Daniels
is in a position to elaborate on that.
We'll take whatever help is offered.
Certainly, our detectives
will work closely
with the behavioral analysis
unit at Quantico...
{\Deputy, }Even with all the resources
at your disposal,
isn't it extremely difficult
to catch a serial killer?
Our ability to secure genetic material
and the growing D.N.A. Data bank
are assets unavailable to us
even a few years ago.
And our ability
to effectively use resources
has been increased with the aid
of sophisticated computer software.
And, of course,
we have some of the best
criminal investigators
in the nation working 24/7.
As the mayor made very clear
a moment ago,
this is now a priority
for the department.
Has a note been found
at any of the scenes?
I'm not at liberty to go into any
details of the investigation{\ at this time}.
You want me to hang?
He told you who I am, right?
Son, the thing about murder
is it never goes off the books.
I mean, we work on 'em for weeks,
months, years.
We keep on with it
until finally
someone decides
they've had enough,
until we get the right word
from the right person.
And you know what happens then?
When a case does go down...
All those people
who kept quiet about it,
who lied about it,
all of them who thought
it wasn't coming back on 'em,
they end up catchin' a charge.
And they get time behind that.
Time, huh?
You gonna give me time?
If you know something
about that boy Lex getting shot,
now is your last chance
to speak to that.
You gave a statement last year...
Why don't you promise
to get me outta here?
That's what y'all doing?
Lie to dumbass niggers?
Yo, y'all need to get this police
out my face before I bank his ass.
You're a natural, kiddo.
You had them eating out of your hand.
Shit, I was just following
the mayor's lead.
He wants a full-court press, right?
We can add a detective or two.
And you can ask patrol to concentrate
where vagrants congregate.
But other than that, deputy,
the cupboard is bare.
- But Carcetti said...
- Make no mistake.
He wants us to solve the murders.
He just doesn't want it to cost.
Don't look so shocked.
You're runnin' with the big dogs now.
Isn't it enough that we're up
on the killer's cellphone?
I would think that you could track him
on the G.P.S. chip alone...
He's using a burner
and we suspect he's taking out
the battery between calls.
And there's nothing to stop him
from changing phones,
calling the reporter from a new number.
So you want to tap
the reporter's phone as well.
It stands to reason that we should
monitor this thing from both ends.
- It's what we would normally do.
- Nothing about this is normal.
A Baltimore Sun reporter's
phone is problematic.
We need to strike a bance
between your needs as investigators
and the first amendment rights
of the Sun and its sources.
The first amendment does not
guarantee privacy, your honor.
- Legal precedent clearly indicates...
- Look,
- I'm not saying that we can't, but...
- But what?
Until we get the sense
that your suspect
is changing phones,
I'm not inclined to look with favor
on tapping the Baltimore
Sun's telecommunications.
We're afraid to piss them off.
Never pick a fight with anyone
who buys ink by the barrel-full.
Christ.
Very well, judge.
How many enemies do you need?
Deputy.
- Where did you get all this?
- Darling, you do not want to know.
What's up with you?
Got all twenty-two
out of the drawer, huh?
- Workin' the whole mess at once.
- I'm trying to see 'em fresh.
Twenty-five.
My triple.
It comes back to Marlo and his people.
For sure?
A good informant tells me so.
Says one of my vics was talking bad
about Mr. Stanfield,
who took it personal.
Killed him, his girl, his muscle.
Left the little kids alive,
so I guess he ain't all bad.
People out there
so scared of this motherfucker.
I can't get close
to an eyewitness on any of it.
Where you at with
the rest of these cases?
We don't even have lab work
on fourteen of these bodies?
A year later{\ and}, I'm still walking
in{\ written} requests into Landsman, watching him
just file them away in his drawer.
McNulty would've called
a news reporter on that shit.
I am not him.
What would the Bunk do?
Take no for a fucking answer?
We had cutbacks,
you know that.
We lost three of four trace examiners.
Lost half our clerical.
The freezer went bad, we lost 4 months
of blood samples. Did you know that?
Four months of evidence and they still
haven't replaced my damn icebox.
My heart pumps purple piss for you.
Now, I got the worst mass
murder in b-more history
and you can't get the tracework
back to me inside of a year?
C'mon, Ron...
Look...
You can't go to the press.
I mean, heads will roll
if this gets out.
It isn't anyone's fault.
In fact, it's a little bit on you,
- in a way.
- The fuck you say?
After Annette took retirement,
the casework got backed up
worse than ever, right?
We put in to fill
the lab assistant slot,
but with all these cutbacks,
the best they could give us was a temp.
- A temp?
- Yeah. No medical. No pension.
A temp hire
to get us over for a while.
Come on, I'll show you mething...
She was assigned to sort and file
the individual trace elements...
Hair, fiber mostly...
You know, from each
of the fourteen scenes.
- So what's the problem?
- In the initial paperwork,
you guys wrote out all
twenty-two c.c. numbers, right?
- Right.
- But in the supplemental requests,
you put all the incidents
under the initial C.C.
and then you wrote, "et Al,"
- remember?
- So?
She didn't know what "et Al" meant.
And she sorted everything under
the single complaint number.
- You don't fuckin' mean...
- Yeah.
We have no idea which one of your scenes
any of this shit came from.
We don't have a clue.
Actually,
except for this...
she's been a pretty good employee.
- Surveillance teams.
- Two each on twelveour shifts.
I need them to set up on certain
locations common to our cases.
C'mon, Jay. You heard the mayor.
This case is a red ball.
That it is.
You can have Greggs, if you want.
The last time I offered her up,
you kicked her back to her own casework.
Other than a second detective,
you are on your own.
- So it's all bullshit.
- I dunno.
I thought the mayor
gave a very nice speech.
I, for one, was moved.
Much like the bull
to which you just referred.
- Tell you one thing...
- What's that?
Motherfucker whose got the connect,
he the one that did Joe.
Oh, no doubt.
Y'all know the co-op took some hits.
Joe. Hungry man.
Good people, especially Joe.
Their passin' was for real,
cold blooded.
I ow what you thinkin',
so I'ma put it out there...
I'm responsible.
A week or so back, I made a move
on Omar, with Joe's approval.
The faggot ain't had heart enough
to come at me,
so he come at those close to me.
Now I'm doublin' the bounty...
Hundred large
for a whiff of that dicksuck.
Two hundred fifty
for his head.
- What about the connect?
- I got that covered.
And in light of that fact,
I'm a take it upon  myself
to conduct this meet.
Slim, I want you take over
hungry man's slice of the cake.
Meanin' no disrespect,
but I ain't cut out to be no C.E.O.
- Cheese, then.
- No problem, man. Got you covered.
Until we settle up with Omar,
I think it's best
we suspend these meets.
In fact, I ain't really one
for meets no how.
Anybody got a problem from here on out,
bring it to me, or sit on that shit.
Those of you on the westside
who need to re-up,
holla' at my man Monk.
He gonna handle supply over there.
On the eastside, cheese.
One more thing.
Price of the brick going up.
Thirty more.
Alright. Enough of this shit.
What?
Next year for the schools.
From now until december,
we're all about the plight
of the homeless.
The great whiting has spoken.
I appealed to Klebanow half hour ago
but he gave me the thumbs down.
I'm sorry.
Check it out, people. Our metro desk
has some national profile.
<i>We're being careful to cooperate
with the investigators</i>
<i>in every way.
My newspaper has no desire</i>
<i>to get between the police
and the suspect.</i>
<i>But still, wouldn't you agree
it's an incredible moment</i>
<i>for any journalist</i>
<i>to come face to face with that type
of pure evil like the son of Sam.</i>
<i>That makes you
the Jimmy Breslin of Baltimore.</i>
<i>Well, no,
I wouldn't say that. I mean...</i>
<i>But knowing you have been in contact</i>
<i>with a killer,</i>
<i>are you at all concerned about
continuing to report from the street?</i>
<i>No, not at all.</i>
<i>I mean, this is what we do.
As a reporter, you expect to be</i>
<i>in harm's way at some points.
It's what we do.</i>
<i>Agreed.
It's what we do.</i>
<i>But very rarely does a reporter end up</i>
<i>being in the middle of a story--</i>
<i>An ongoing story--</i>
<i>About a murderer
who is still at large</i>
<i>and posing a severe
and deadly risk to the...</i>
You shoulda heard Phelan this morning.
Too scared to tap the newspaper phones
they might shit on him for it.
Fuckin' hack judge.
What would you want with more wires?
We got all we need.
I don't want another wire.
It's the principle of the thing...
It just pissed me off
listening to him.
Oh yeah,
no surveillance cars.
They won't go
beyond me and Greggs.
You and Sydnor will have to work
it as best you can for right now.
Assholes.
They need another body, don't they?
I'll call our man in the southern.
I can take it from here.
Y'all can bounce.
Alright, boss.
What up, Rick?
Just like ol' times for me and you, huh?
Whatever you
want it's yours, alright?
Tonight,
I'm just gonna take yo' jump...
- And leave you with a little something.
- What's that?
My word in your ear.
I'm callin' Marlo a straight bitch.
I'm sayin' it don't take much
to shoot down a blind man.
And as for him steppin' to me,
you tell that dude
he ain't got the heart.
Alright.
You tell that man
I'm in the street, waiting.
And just like a little bitch,
he ain't nowhere to be found.
I'll tell him.
I will.
Pick up your keys
and go on inside, yo.
You kill Joe?
Hungry?
Didn't think so.
What now?
There's more than one way
to skin a case.
Already ran them for priors, right?
Priors, yeah.
But I'm gonna run every name you guys
developed through the entire database.
Not just for priors, but for anything
at all in the miles system.
Court appearances,
parole, probation,
gun permits,
D.O.C., open bails.
- You're playing longshots, huh?
- Darlin',
I'm playin'  the hand I've been dealt.
An H-file?
- Who caught the case?
- Worden. Other shift.
Stepfather.
Beaten to death.
They interviewed the mother,
but no one else in the household.
Doesn't exactly fit
with the others, does it?
A straight up ass-whoopin' in an alley
- doesn't seem like Marlo staield.
- No it doesn't.
But you're gonna work it anyway.
In the pentecostal church
where I was given religion,
it would have been said that the spirit
- was on you yesterday.
- It got good to me.
- Let praises be.
- {\I don't know. }It just pissed me off
that on top of everything
else I gotta deal with,
some nutjob starts
killing homeless guys.
{\I mean, }Fuck already,
how many shitbowls are there?
He's right{\ though}. You were great.
That passion
was just the thing.
- You think...
- We step out on this issue,
it could provide
some national presence.
Didn't the Governor scrap the emergency
medical and housing program last year?
What was it, Temha?
He did, replaced it with T-dap,
which cuts funding to anyone
- {\who doesn't qualify} not qualifying for federal support.
- It's worse{\ than that}, actually:
he froze eligibility
by disallowing new applications,
which put all kinda folks
out on the street.
So we slam the Republican
for sticking it to the poor.
It plays.
Nationally, you're ting up
the cause of the forgotten...
And no one is ever in favor
of homelessness...
Statewide, you're going up against
the fella who tore up the safety net.
Homelessness.
I'll be damned.
- Base to twenty-three-oh-six.
- <i>Go ahead, Lester.</i>
You see anybody using a cellphone?
<i>Wait one.</i>
<i>Negative.</i>
Hold on.
Somebody's here.
Lester...
Can't get used to how empty
this place feels nowadays.
True, but you'd be surprised
what you can get done
when no one's looking
over your shoulder.
You'll need to serve these.
Running out of time.
I'll get right on it.
There's a couple of loose ends
I think we should cover as well.
- Now?
- If not now, when?
The trial date is coming up on us fast.
Right.
But it's uh...
Is it something I said?
No, it's...
Sydnor is bringing in a C.I.
- And if you're here...
- Oh, shit.
I'm sorry.
- I'll leave you my list, okay?
- No problem.
We'll get right on it.
I'm sorry, Lester,
if I was intruding.
You couldn't know.
So why you here?
If this about Michael
an' what he into,
y'all should know
he don't live here no more.
Actually, I'm following
up on your man's case.
You spoke to detective Worden
when it happened.
He was your boyfriend, right?
When he weren't in jail...
Father to my youngest.
But you know how he died.
Beaten bad.
Crime of passion, as we say.
Didn't seem like he was home long enough
to get somebody that riled at him.
Unless, of course, it was over you.
What, you sayin'
I know somethin' about that?
Let's put our cards on the table.
I been in this game
longer than a little bit,
and there's one thing I know from jump.
You get a murder like this,
there's bound to be a woman
at the center of it.
I don't know nothin'.
You know my gut tells me that you do.
And I'll tell you what...
We're gonna take a ride downtown,
let you talk to the grand jury.
You're not straight with them,
they'll slap you
with a material witness warrant.
And you sit over at woman's
detention for a couple of weeks.
It's amazing what it does
for the grieving process.
- Get your things.
- I ain't goin' no damn where.
It's me or the wagon.
Detective, I swear, I ain't in this.
It ain't me you wanna talk to.
It's the boy, he know.
He runnin' with them who did it.
You{\ just} tryin' to put me
off the scent here.
{\No, }You gotta believe me.
He told me Devar wasn't comin' home,
'fore we even knowed he was dead.
You said he's runnin' with them?
- Runnin' with who?
- Chris, Snoop, all them gangsters.
Who else doin'
all the killin' around here?
Let me see your camera.
Add a minute-six to your times.
Got it.
Here it is. Look at this.
Single ring.
Connection. Silence.
What do you have?
I took these three.
They're just hangin' around.
What time did Monk leave?
One twenty-four.
Two minutes later.
It's not what Marlo's sayin',
it's what he's sendin'.
Look at Monk.
- Yeah. Text message.
- Text?
Need I remind you, detective,
these young men are products
of Baltimore city schools.
Besides, look how far away
he's holding his phone.
Too far away to be reading a text.
Naw, son. Pictures.
Pictures...
What the fuck you lookin' at?
You know what they do, right?
They tease you.
They let you get close and...
just when you're about to pull the case,
they rip the fuckin' rug
out from under you.
I'm not lying. We got
a fuckin' serial killer on the loose.
You didn't know that?
It's in the goddamn paper.
What support do I get?
One fuckin' detective.
They wanna play their
simple-ass games, fine.
But I gotta do what I gotta do.
'scuse me.
Yeah, Oscar.
Beautiful.
Absolutely. Where?
On my way.
Man, you can't
let it get to you like this.
Why don't we go buy up a bunch of toys
and take 'em to your kids?
You ain't hearin' me.
How can I go near my people
with Omar on us?
How he gonna find out about them?
How we find out
about the blind man?
- Omar, yo, Omar!
- Hey yo, Omar!
Get.
You too, shorty.
Omar!
It's Omar!
Money a little late today.
That buckshot in your leg should help
you some you explain' yourself to Marlo.
As for them other two
they gonna wish
that I'd peppered them a bit.
Now you make sure
you tell old Marlo I burned the money.
'cause it ain't about that paper.
It's about me hurtin' his people,
messin' with his world.
Tell that boy he ain't man enough
to come down to the street with Omar.
You tell him that!
My Sergeant and two side
partners got here before me.
Then the shift commander showed.
Now the duty officer is on his way.
- For a D.O.A.?
- Yeah, well,
you and Lester
started some shit here, son.
Now a D.O.A. call
brings everyone in a heartbeat.
God bless.
Pictures?
Photographs on cellphones.
Now that means new P.C.
to capture the photos,
and new equipment that could do it.
How do I write that into
my bullshit homeless killer's M.O.?
When we started this,
you said all we needed were some bugs,
a camera or two,
and in a couple of weeks,
we'd have them.
That's what you said.
So I cranked up my
bullshit to pay for that,
but no, then you
needed a wiretap.
So I went along with that,
I got you the wiretap.
Then you ask for surveillance teams,
but before I can get to that,
you came to me with this.
I mean, what the fuck?
I gotta tell you, Lester,
I don't want to hurt your feelings,
but I can see why Daniels cringed
every time
you opened your fucking mouth.
You're a supervisor's nightmare.
I'm just following the thread.
Okay, say we get you the intercept on
your pictures, will that give us Marlo?
It'll be coded, probably,
but I'm sure we can break it.
That'll tell us
how they do business,
and usually, that's enough.
Or not.
But the truth is,
I'm running Sydnor ragged
just staying on a couple of mopes
and monitoring calls.
Now, when we're up on their code,
we're going to need more manpower
to run down a stash or a re-up.
We can't do it all.
I can't juke this thing
any more than I have.
Last night, half the police department
turned up at Oscar's crime scene
before I could get there.
We can't make another murder.
Thanks for the milk.
What's a donut without milk?
So you were talking about
your second tour...
The bad one, yeah.
Second tour fucked me up good.
But they don't wanna hear it.
Who doesn't?
Mostly, it's command
and the Senior E.M.S.
Put it down that marines
don't get P.T.S.D.
But they do.
Can you tell me what happened?
Terry, can you talk about it?
We had a month left on the tour,
working an s-and-a mission
outside Fallujah.
I was assistant team leader.
Our m-niner, niner, eights
were retritted with up-armor kits.
M-niner-niner-eight?
A humvee,
sorry.
They're big on nomenclature.
Anyway we finished our sweep,
headed back in, right? It was all good.
Then, bam...
Our lead vehicle was hit
with an elevated I.E.D.
The blast tore
the m-fifty gunner in half.
Flipped the humvee
like a matchbox car.
Driver lost both his hands.
Blood shooting out all over.
He's fuckin' laughin',
saying over and over,
"Look, ma, no hands."
It's the laughing I can't shake.
Weird.
'cause he's okay, you know?
I mean, he's better than me.
Got himself
a couple of prosthetic mitts,
eighty thousand apiece.
What happened next?
Nothing really.
We pushed out,
secured the perimeter.
Corpsman did what he could,
an' we waited for the cas-evac.
Look, I'm not looking
to shit on another guy's copy,
I just wanted you to know
this was out there.
I'm at a community meeting
in Bel Air-Edison
to hear about school zoning and
this woman talked my ear off about this.
She said the kids never saw a dime.
I mean, I'm hoping
this is all bullshit.
- Hey{\, Scott}. How's it coming?
- Pretty good.
- You seen the art?
- Yeah,{\ yeah. Good stuff,} good stuff. Listen,
we got a complaint about a story
you wrote a couple weeks ago.
The one about the woman who died
from an allery{\allergic reaction} to seafood,
- Remember?
- And?{\What about it?}
Neighborhood lady
knows the dead woman's sister
says our story made a lot of money
for those kids,
- a scholarship fund we wrote up.
- Yeah? So...
She says the sister has a history
of fraud, convictions on it.
She says all the money went to Atlantic
city casinos and kids never saw a dime.
- Christ, who the fuck...
- I know.
It's probably some old biddy
talkin' about stuff she don't know,
but maybe you should go
back and check with the family,
see if we don't get took on this, huh?
No, no. Not now.
After you file.
Just make a couple calls, huh?
- This is kidnapping.
- Actually, I'm not sure.
I asked him if he wanted and talk
- and he walked to my car.
- You give him the hundred?
Stuffed it in his jacket.
He's fine, Lester.
He's great.
- Think he'll find his way back home?
- Eventually.
By then, we'll be done with Marlo,
we'll have shut this thing down.
And as far as
what happened to this guy...
They'll write it off
as some fraternity prank.
- Does he know we're cops?
- No.
And even if he figures it out,
who's gonna believe him? He's nuts.
- How do you know he's nuts?
- First of all, just look at him.
He's fucking bouncing off the walls.
Second of all...
I got his scrip.
I called the university E.R.
It's an anti-psychotic.
So...
I took his I.D.,
I'll scratch his name off the scrip
and leave him with this...
I got that one from the first
homeless death Oscar gave us.
The one that was too rigored.
Donald somebody or other.
It had him in a Cleveland,
Ohio shelter.
McNulty, you are deserving
of serious psychological study.
You need P.C.
to intercept cellphone photos.
Well here it is, right here.
We send photos of this guy
all ribboned up
from a dry cellphone
to that goofy reporter, along with
a message bitching about his stories.
"I ain't no pervert," or whatever.
Now, the killer says,
you ain't gonna find no more bodies.
Only photos of the victims...
Before they disappear.
Look at this poor sucker.
I don't believe we're gonna do this.
He disappears, the city goes batshit.
You get your photo intercepts,
and by the time we need
to run down one of Marlo's re-ups,
you got all the
manpower you need.
And Marlo falls.
Fall hard.
Don't fucking tell me
you mislabeled ts too.
I want comparisons
between known suspects
and the D.N.A. from this scene.
By the looks of it, we got a whole
lot of D.N.A. outta this mess.
- Now, motherfucker. Right now.
- Top of my list.
As soon as we work through all the trace
from the homeless killings.
That's the priority, Bunk.
The homeless killings.
Everything is backed up
behind that, sorry.
Your boy McNulty has
everyone's attention right now.
So it's Larry, huh?
Okay, Larry.
You're with good people here.
It's all gonna be great.
You're gonna like this place.
It's warm, they got nice beds.
And best of all, I gave you cash money
just for walking in the door.
Come on, Larry.
It's goin' to be fine.
I promise.
You feel up for trying Clay yourself?
I mean, it's been a while since
you tried a criminal case personally.
It sends a statement, I think.
We should start with our witness list.
See if we can pare that down any,
out of respect for the distracted nature
of a Baltimore jury.
First,
there's something else
I need to bring up.
- Old grand jury stuff?
- Sealed indictments.
Sealed transcripts.
Dozens of them.
Pulled from the desk
of a shot-to-death drug dealer
in east Baltimore.
The deputy ops brought me those.
We have a leak.
And he showed up,
outside where I work.
He was confused.
Lost I think. So I brought him here.
Donald, where you from?
Tell the lady, Donald.
Baltimore.
But he told me
he came from Cleveland.
Do you have identification?
This does say cleveland.
Donald, why don't we
get you something to eat?
It's okay. Come on.
We're good to go?
It's great, Gus.
It sings.
Hey, Scottie boy.
Hey. Great piece.
I mean this one really feels
like the real deal.
- It's great work.
- Thanks.
What I like most about it
is that you didn't overwrite it.
No extra color.
No puffy adjectives. Just...
tight, declarative sentences.
You really let this ex-marine
just tell his story.
- Thanks, Gus.
- Hey, Mr. Slot man,
read it and weep.
And I mean that literally.
Oh, hey, Scott.
Did you get a chance to...
- drop a couple calls on that complaint?
- It's bullshit.
I talked to people
in the neighborhood.
Sister's good people, but
there's another woman,
up there, unrelated,
keeps getting arrested
for kiting checks and stuff, and she...
uses the sister's name
every time she gets locked up.
She's done it like
three or four times{\ now}.
- No shit.
- Yeah, it's crazy.
But sister's clean.
Everyone says so.
Okay.
Is there anything else
I can do for him?
No, we've got it.
But thanks for bringing him in.
Most people, they just ignore them.
I just want to get all of
your paperwork taken care of...
Ils sont en ligne.
Ce sera masqué, comme pour
le numéro de portable de Marlo ?
- Putain, comment ?
- Trafiqué pour imiter un flux,
comme sur les commutateurs
des compagnies de téls.
On peut mettre
n'importe quel numéro.
Pendant ce temps,
la compagnie qui est sur le dossier
a le portable qu'on a donné à Sydnor.
C'est assez simple.
Tiens-toi au texte.
On veut pas de salades.
Même avec le modulateur de voix,
tu te mouilles.
<i>7-B-14.</i>
<i>KGA. On vous écoute, 14.</i>
<i>14. J'ai un véhicule
bloquant une entrée.</i>
<i>400, Presstman.</i>
Salut, toi. D'où tu te permets,
<i>sale petit dingo ? Sexuel ?</i>
Il s'agit pas de sexe. Je les viole pas.
<i>Comment t'oses écrire un truc sur moi
sans me connaître ?</i>
Mordre, c'est pas sexuel.
C'est que des morsures.
Je suis pas malade à ce point.
Attendez. Attendez...
<i>Je devrais peut-être venir te mordre.</i>
Ça te plairait, Scotty ?
<i>Je parie que oui. Pas vrai ?</i>
<i>T'écris sur moi comme si j'étais malade.
C'est toi, le malade, tu sais ça ?</i>
<i>C'est pour ça que tu m'aimes, Scotty ?</i>
<i>C'est pour ça ?</i>
Putain de moi.
Ici Holley,
de la Criminelle de Baltimore.
Il me faut une localisation
pour le dossier 08H114.
Utilisation du portable en cours.
<i>Je vais venir te mordre, tu me diras</i>
<i>si c'est sexuel.</i>
Attendez. Qui... Où êtes-vous ?
<i>Voilà ce qu'on va faire.</i>
<i>Tu m'as humilié ?</i>
Tu m'as mortifié
devant mon père ?
Le père de mon père ?
<i>Écoute-moi bien, l'accro, le toxico,</i>
<i>le petit mytho.</i>
Maintenant,
vous les trouverez plus.
Vous les verrez plus.
Je t'envoie un truc maintenant.
Regarde bien ce mec-là,
<i>parce que tu le reverras plus.</i>
D'accord. Ne raccrochez pas.
<i>Peut-on...</i>
- Merde. T'as eu McNulty ?
- Que sa messagerie.
Bon Dieu.
C'était lui.
De nouveau.
Bien, l'accent de Bawlmer.
Mon héritage.

- Lâchez-moi.
- À terre !

Vous lui faites mal, arrêtez.

- Sergent, on le tient.
- Mon cul.
- Je l'ai enregistré.

J'ai raté quoi ?

Il a dit qu'il voulait me mordre.
- Comment ça, vous mordre ?
- Scott, vous aurait-il menacé de...

{\c&HFFFFFF&}<b>TOOK</b>
{\c&HFFFFFF&}"On ne l'apprend pas
en école de droit." - Pearlman
- On est partenaires ou quoi ?
- Non, Clay.
Je ne prendrai pas un seul juré
sans que mes honoraires complets
ne soient payés.
Si vous voulez Billy Murphy,
il va falloir le payer.
J'ai une part pour vous d'avance.
Une bonne part à cinq chiffres.
Mais vous me demandez d'emblée
des honoraires de vainqueur,
mais le problème, c'est que je suis pas
encore vainqueur. Pour l'instant,
avec la corde autour de mon cou,
je n'ai pas les supports financiers
à ma disposition
sur lesquels je peux compter
habituellement, vous voyez ?
- Les bienfaiteurs se font rares, hein ?
- Ils voient
à court terme alors qu'ils devraient
voir à long terme. Scandaleux.
25 000.
25 000 en plus quand vous aurez
- un jury.
- Je ne travaille pas comme ça.
Je sais bien, partenaire, je sais bien.
En temps normal, je rêverais même pas
de vous demander de vous habiller
pour pareille circonstance...
200 000 quand je vous aurai sorti
de ce pétrin.
Et, Clay, me baisez pas.
N'envisagez même pas de me baiser
sur une seule partie de ces honoraires.
Billy, vous parlez
comme si vous ne me connaissiez pas.
Je suis déçu.
Vraiment.
Mon frère, soyons juste.
Je vous apporte l'opportunité
de faire un face-à-face
avec le procureur de l'État
dans une affaire
qui fera la une des journaux.
Pour une telle pub ?
Putaiiin, partenaire,
c'est vous qui devriez me payer.
Sérieusement, gros, pour 20 000
en liquide à mon comité de campagne,
je me laisse accuser au niveau fédéral,
pour vous laisser le procès.
Vous corrigez les fédés
et vous vous faites un nom.
Vous baiser ?
Non, fiston, je vais vous ériger.
La plèbe foutra aux chiottes
Johnnie Cochran
et aura votre carte de visite en poche
avant qu'on ait fini.
J'ai déjà plus de notoriété
que n'importe quel avocat.
Pourquoi vous ne gardez pas
votre baratin pour le jury ?
D'accord.
Non, rien depuis.
Moi, Barlow et Kincaid, on était ici
à se tourner les pouces,
sans rien à foutre.
Rien, pas un appel. Puis boum.
Pas de bol au port.
On suivait le GPS, puis ça s'est arrêté.
Au niveau de la jetée 5.
- Où est McNulty ?
- Au journal.
Repasse cet enculé.
<i>Salut, toi.</i>
<i>D'où tu te permets, sale petit dingo ?</i>
On dirait un mordu de voitures
de Dundalk.
Émotionnellement, il était comment ?
- Il semblait énervé.
- Après vous ?
Comme je vous l'ai dit,
il a dit que je l'avais humilié
en écrivant que mordre était sexuel.
Il a fini par proposer de venir
pour me mordre.
J'ai pas vraiment répondu.
- C'était le même gars ?
- Comment ça ?
C'était la même voix
que le premier appel ?
Ah, oui. Non, en fait.
Oui. Enfin, oui.
C'était la même,
mais cette fois, j'ai remarqué
qu'il avait un accent d'ici.
Fort prononcé.
Vous aviez pas noté ça la 1re fois ?
Si, mais j'ai dû oublier.
- J'ai foiré quelque chose ?
- Non, pas du tout.
Écoutez, on se réserve le droit
de prendre cette décision,
mais indépendamment de cela,
est-ce que publier ces photos
- entraverait l'enquête ?
- Je pense pas.
En fait, on a besoin du maximum
de couverture pour trouver ce SDF.
Vous savez pas où est ce gars ?
Il pourrait être...
Il pourrait déjà être mort.
Bon Dieu.
C'est sur Charles et Conway.
- Je me demande si c'est un habitué.
- Il a utilisé un autre téléphone.
Ça devait être un portable,
pour t'envoyer ça.
Effectivement. Mais...
vous ne pouvez là aussi rien publier
sur la provenance de l'appel.
On recherche ce portable.
Et s'il rappelle ?
Gardez-le autant que possible.
Ne l'effrayez pas.
Il aime fulminer. Laissez-le faire.
Ça va ?
Moi ? Oui, ça peut aller.
Ne vous inquiétez pas,
il se sert juste de vous.
Ça me plaît pas tellement.
Enfin, ça marche plutôt pas mal
pour vous deux, non ?
Messieurs, merci pour ça.
J'ai appelé Vincent toute la matinée,
il répond toujours pas.
On a pas de temps à perdre.
Le réappro va se faire
et on a toujours pas le mannitol.
Putain ?
Yo, Vincent !
T'es où ?
Manny ?
- Omar !
- Pourquoi t'es pas mort, alors ?
Il a dit de dire à Marlo
qu'il l'attendait dans la rue.
Que toute la ville allait savoir
que Marlo a pas le courage de venir.
- Trouvé la planque ?
- Cherry,
il a allumé Manny dès qu'il est rentré.
- Il allait me liquider aussi.
- Comment il est entré ?
Manny sortait acheter de la bouffe,
et ce suceur de bite était juste là.
Il savait que c'était la planque.
Pas la peine de lui dire que dalle.
Il savait.
4 kilos de pure, aux chiottes.
Yo, Cherry, tu vas me détacher, hein ?
Allez, négro, détache-moi.
Sérieusement, Steven.
Si vous ne pouvez pas,
ce n'est pas grave, je comprends.
Et si vous pensez que ce clown
va rester gouverneur,
je sais que vous devez vous couvrir,
attendant beaucoup d'Annapolis.
Mais si vous choisissez un camp,
faites-le tôt.
- Voilà tout.
- <i>J'entends bien, Tommy.</i>
<i>Vous savez quoi ? Je fais un chèque
aujourd'hui que je vous envoie.</i>
Génial, Steven. Merci beaucoup.
Pouvez-vous...
envisager...
<i>Je doublerai le montant
en ajoutant ma femme.</i>
En ajoutant votre femme ?
C'est vraiment génial.
- Merci pour votre effort.
- <i>Avec plaisir, Tommy.</i>
Des photos ?
Il a envoyé des photos
de la possible victime
au journaliste du <i>Sun</i>.
J'ai été où ce gars est habituellement,
il semble effectivement avoir disparu.
Ces photos viennent du journal,
mais on veut intercepter les prochaines.
D'où l'ordonnance modifiée.
Exact.
Peut-on intercepter des photos
avec le matériel de la ville ?
En fait, non.
On est encore au 20e siècle.
Mais le comté de Howard a ce qu'il faut
sur deux de leurs ordinateurs.
Il en faut deux ?
Oui, si l'un tombe en panne,
il nous reste l'autre.
On veut pas louper ce cinglé.
Eh bien, bonne chasse.
Merci, monsieur le juge.
Vous en avez parlé à votre chef ?
Il va appeler le maire ?
Et Rawls aussi, j'imagine.
Ce sacré petit gaillard
se fait élire
grâce à ses slogans sécuritaires.
La criminalité stagne.
Et là, deux semaines avant
de se présenter comme gouverneur,
un extrémiste se met à tuer, à prendre
des photos et à les envoyer au journal.
Vérifiez l'alibi du gouverneur.
Vous voyez ?
Merci.
Tu en as même pas eu 30 ?
20 ?
92 !
Je vais vous dire,
il y a beaucoup de gens
qui veulent Tommy Carcetti
comme gouverneur.
Qu'ont-ils dans la tête ?
92, Norman, en une seule matinée.
Nouveau record.
L'enculé de tueur de SDF ?
Il en a chopé un, lui a attaché
un ruban, a envoyé une photo
au <i>Baltimore Sun</i>, disant
qu'on ne trouverait pas le corps.
- Quoi ?
- Le journal va publier les photos ?
Bill Rawls !
Je le veux en ligne de suite.
<i>Vieille canaille</i>
<i>Je serai content quand tu seras mort,
vieille canaille</i>
Regarde-toi,
pauvre bébé bosselé.
Regarde-toi.
En avant.
L'adjoint veut le plus de monde possible
à l'étage de suite.
On va mettre le paquet
sur le tueur en série de McNulty.
J'ai des affaires en cours.
Bunk, représentation de gala.
L'adjoint veut du monde.
Cette histoire dégoûte le maire.
J'y vais pas.
Tu les vois, ceux-là, sur ma chemise ?
Ça me parait évident, Bunk.
Je fais du travail de police, là !
J'ai même une nouvelle piste
sur la grosse affaire de l'an passé,
sur laquelle il ne reste plus que moi.
Alors j'emmerde tes galons
et j'emmerde McNulty.
Et j'emmerde ta super grosse affaire.
Si ça te convient pas,
t'as qu'à faire un rapport
et envoyer mon cul devant le conseil.
Alma restera au côté de l'enquête
et des inspecteurs en centrale.
Tu ne rentres pas sans avoir vérifié
les nouvelles avant la 3e édition.
McNulty sera le responsable,
avec le reste de son équipe
en soutien immédiat.
L'équipe du lieutenant D'Addario
sera sur l'écoute.
En plus d'Alma et de Scott,
Olesker aura une chronique.
Fletcher, je veux les réactions des SDF
et des interviews d'experts
discutant du problème.
Melody, appelle les blouses blanches
de l'hôpital Clifton T. Perkins ou autre
et développe un encadré
sur pourquoi un tueur
irait parler de son meurtre
à un journaliste.
Greggs, j'ai examiné les dossiers.
Alors qu'il y a eu
beaucoup d'interviews sur le terrain,
on n'a pas fait de travail de fond
sur les victimes et familles.
C'est pour vous.
Colonel Tomlin, il nous faut des équipes
tactiques pour les surveillances
et pour des infiltrations chez les SDF.
Nous devons agir dans la rue
de façon proactive.
Cette affaire est autant
à propos de prévention
que d'arrestation.
On peut pas bosser là-dessus
au téléphone.
Il nous faut être dans la rue,
la vivre en direct.
Nous devons garder les media
dans la partie.
Ce journaliste qui a été contacté
est au centre de l'affaire.
Ça peut être un moyen d'aboutir.
Tu es au centre de l'affaire.
Le papier sur ton dernier contact
avec le tueur sera à la 1re personne,
mais Alma t'interviewera aussi.
Les premières vérifications de McNulty
avec les refuges
et une ronde à Conway et Charles
indiquent que notre victime a disparu,
mais dès qu'on a son identité, on doit
s'assurer que ce n'est pas un canular.
Chef, il nous faudra
des hommes des districts
pour doter la Crim d'une surveillance.
Et ayant de l'expérience
concernant la politique d'effectifs,
je laisse McNulty les choisir.
Je sais pour une fois que les ressources
nécessaires pour travailler
seront à notre disposition.
Alors, cernons ce fouillis
et investiguons à fond.
Celle-ci est prometteur.
Le maire m'informe qu'il n'y aura
aucune limitation en heures sup'
ou en effectifs pour cette affaire.
Alors, bouclez cette affaire.
Travail de police.
Étonnant, hein ?
J'ai la Déferlante !
La Déferlante de rue !
Bonne journée. Six paquets jusque-là.
Ce nouveau paquet tue ces guédros.
Faudra sûrement un réappro de plus.
- Portes ouvertes au coin de la rue ?
- Técal, négro.
Mike, téma.
"Hydrothérapiste certifié.
"Familier des patients en gériatrie.
- "Dispensaire de Sinai."
- Jerry qui ?
Oublie. Et ça, écoute.
"Secrétaire cabinet.
"Cabinet dentaire haut de gamme
recherche secrétaire."
- Quoi, un meuble ?
- Une réceptionniste, je crois.
T'es jamais allé chez le dentiste.
"Chef de service Cavca."
- C'est quoi, un Cavca ?
- "CVCA". C'est peut-être mal écrit.
"Chef de service dans un environnement
avec délais à respecter."
Pas intéressant.
Et même, t'as pas 16 piges.
Et tu dois aller chercher Bug à 3 h.
Attends, attends.
"Danseuse exotique, quartier financier
centre-ville, horaires déjeuner.
"Être souple de corps et d'esprit."
Ça, c'est intéressant.
<i>La misère</i>
<i>Fais-leur la misère</i>
- On arrête.
- Temps mort.
- J'ai fait quoi, putain ?
- Si on l'ignore, alors tu le sais.
C'est n'importe quoi.
Yo, oublie pas, pour Bug.
S'agissant d'une enquête en cours,
je vous demanderai
d'adresser vos questions aux policiers,
mieux équipés pour répondre.
Ces nouveaux développements
dans l'affaire sont perturbants,
tragiques et inacceptables.
Nous faisons tout notre possible
pour localiser et identifier l'individu
représenté sur les photographies
envoyées au <i>Baltimore Sun</i> aujourd'hui.
Nous nous évertuons à protéger
les autres citoyens sans-abri,
et nous poursuivons le suspect avec
tous les moyens à notre disposition.
J'ai dit clairement
à mes chefs de police
qu'ils avaient toute ma confiance
et l'autorisation d'employer
toutes les ressources nécessaires.
Et laissez-moi être catégorique :
cet homme sera amené
devant la justice. Merci.
Voix et photos numériques.
Il passe un autre appel,
tu auras l'un des deux.
Je peux vérifier ces dossiers moi-même,
pas la peine...
Tu as entendu l'adjoint.
Il a spécifiquement affecté Greggs.
Greggs a un triple meurtre.
Cette brigade a ton tueur en série,
une affaire majeure.
Jimmy, tu es le meneur
sur le gus qui a disparu.
Tu as pas le temps
de travailler d'anciens dossiers.
Ça revient à Greggs, point final.
Maintenant,
que te faut-il d'autre ?
Les équipes de surveillance,
mais pour l'instant,
laisse-moi trouver son identité
au plus vite, voir qui il est.
Après ça, j'en saurai plus.
- Analyse de la voix de l'appel ?
- Putain, je crois pas à ces conneries.
Après, tu vas vouloir
que j'aille à Quantico avec ce truc.
Justement, d'ailleurs...
Tu ne crois pas en la médecine
comportementale, Dr Moreland ?
Je ne crois pas en grand-chose
à ce stade.
On s'en branle de ce qu'on peut croire
à ce stade.
Tu as rouvert les vannes, Jimmy.
Ils repayent enfin le travail de police.
Fiers de vous ?
On est proches de Marlo.
Une semaine ou deux au plus.
Ça fait quel effet
de retirer Greggs de son triple ?
De savoir que vous avez
des équipes de surveillance,
des patrouilles de district, des équipes
tactiques traquant des conneries.
Les équipes de surveillance vont
nous aider à boucler l'affaire, Bunk.
Je veux même pas savoir
qui est le type sur la photo,
ou bien où ce quidam se trouve.
Noms et adresses, tout ce que tu as.
- Jimmy...
- Te fais pas tuer.
Putain.
T'inquiète, fiston. Je gère tout ça.
Autre chose.
Mon gosse va dormir chez moi.
Où trouver des meubles pour enfants ?
Ikea.
À plus.
Honte à vous.
Je suis sérieux.
- <i>Analyses labo.</i>
- C'est Moreland.
<i>Tu as appelé à l'instant.</i>
Je sais,
et je rappelle. J'ai besoin des analyses
du dossier 06H271,
et j'en ai besoin de suite.
<i>Je sais, il a pas encore eu le temps.</i>
Dis-lui que j'ai appelé
et que je continuerai à appeler
jusqu'à ce qu'il ressente
ma putain de douleur, vu ?
Emballé.
Numéro 1.
Putain ! Comment ils veulent
que je règle ça tout seul ?
Cette police de miséreux
paye même pas.
Ça va ?
C'est la merde. Tout est de la merde.
Je pourrais boucler le truc
sans ces enculés de rapiats.
T'as quoi ?
Un bon indic m'a fourgué
un témoin oculaire qui m'évitait.
Il pionce chez une meuf à Athol Avenue.
Il arrive tard, mais il part tôt.
- Et ?
- Ça me gêne pas
de guetter toute la nuit sans être payé.
Mais c'est un appart en rez-de-jardin.
Parc-autos des deux côtés.
S'il décide de se garer côté rue
et de traverser la pelouse, il lui reste
les portes-fenêtres.
Deux hommes en plus, ça irait ?
Oui, et deux voitures en plus.
J'ai plus d'effectifs que nécessaire.
Un appel, et je te file deux éléments
des équipes tactiques.
Tu leur dis que c'est pour moi.
Les heures iront dans mon dossier.
Tu peux faire ça ?
À Dieu va.
Tu reconnais qui c'est ?
Regarde-toi.
Tu clignes même pas des yeux.
Non pas que je te le reproche,
après ce que ce sale enculé t'a fait.
Quand même, ce truc-là est brutal.
Celui qui a fait ça s'est bien amusé,
tu me suis ?
Maintenant,
je sais que c'était pas toi.
Parce que, sauf ton respect,
tu n'as pas la physicalité
pour infliger ce genre de dommages.
Celui qui a fait ça
a dû être une personne adulte et forte.
Une personne qui fait peur.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
C'est vous qui êtes de la Crim.
Comment j'saurais ?
- C'est bon pour un sur le vif ?
- Faisons un plan large.
Bande de vautours.
Ça fait classique, je sais.
Accroche anecdotique, paragraphe
désordonné, meilleure citation...
Ça irait en encadré,
mais pour demain, allonge-le.
Passe du temps avec ces gens, tu vois ?
Je veux dire...
parfois, le point faible de l'article,
c'est ce qu'il y a entre guillemets.
Un type disant que la vie dans la rue
est dure, ça n'a pas d'attrait.
Mais si tu peux le décrire
tel qu'il est vraiment,
raconter son histoire par périodes...
Demain, retourne dans les refuges
et les soupes populaires,
pour être avec les gens.
Je m'en fiche si tu rends pas de copie.
Si une histoire se présente, génial.
Sinon, contente-toi
de passer la journée avec des gens.
Les citations et les comptes
m'intéressent pas, là,
mais l'authenticité, oui.
C'est bon. 4 feuillets,
avec de la place pour Price,
sur la mairie.
- Scott ?
- Cinq minutes.
- On arrive à la première édition.
- Trois minutes.
On l'avait mis en...
Comment ça s'appelle ?
- Désintoxication.
- Quatre fois.
On n'est pas riches.
Henry est handicapé.
On le fait sortir,
il fait toutes sortes de promesses,
mais, enfin, vous savez...
Je suis navrée.
La dernière fois,
on a décidé de ne pas être là pour lui.
On savait qu'il allait sûrement mourir,
avec la drogue.
On s'en doutait.
Mais, dans les journaux, ce truc sexuel.
Les morsures ou que sais-je...
Personne ne mérite ça.
Vous voyez ce qui me pose problème ?
La 1re personne est une chose.
Je sais, il doit s'intégrer à l'article.
C'est primordial.
Mais qu'il dise avoir passé
jour et nuit avec les sans-abri...
Par exemple,
partager leurs "coins de rue
les plus sombres avec eux".
Il a le style d'un essayiste.
On a une chronique d'Olesker,
en une de Métro.
C'est assez puissant
sans être mélodramatique.
Mais ce truc
que Scott a écrit,
il donne l'impression d'avoir vécu
avec les sans-abri des semaines.
Il passe une nuit sous l'autoroute JFX,
une demi-journée
à interroger dans un refuge.
C'est pas du Studs Terkel.
- On devrait pas publier en l'état ?
- Je veux dire...
On a son interview sur l'appel du tueur
dans le reportage d'Alma.
On a ses citations. Mais le reste,
on dirait qu'il prend
des risques extrêmes
en allant sous une autre autoroute
la nuit.
C'est notre putain de ville.
Pas Beyrouth.
Je respecte vos inquiétudes.
Je vais passer le papier
sous ma propre édition. Ça vous va ?
OK.
<i>Malgré le refus de parler à l'écran,
les parents de Jonathan Boland</i>
<i>espèrent que la nouvelle attention
sur la mort de leur fils</i>
<i>il y a quelques années
mènera la police à son assassin.</i>
<i>Pour Channel Six News, Patricia...</i>
Les media sont déchaînés.
La mairie aussi.
Mais pour une fois,
on nous donne des moyens.
- Ça fait quel effet ?
- Un sentiment d'interdit.
Comme s'ils allaient découvrir
tout ce qu'on dépense et tout couper.
Tu ne connais pas encore tout ?
Je veux vérifier une fois encore.
La sélection du jury sera finie à midi,
puis le débat sera ouvert.
Pour M. Bond, lui seul.
Il lui faut un solide second.
Que je connaisse le dossier
de fond en comble.
- Combien de temps, Lester ?
- Si Marlo a un code, on peut briser
le code. C'est sûr.
Combien de temps ?
Dépend du code, n'est-ce pas ?
Le plus tôt on aura fini,
le plus sûr ce sera.
Landsman veut que j'aille à Quantico,
que le FBI fasse un profil.
Tu pourrais apprendre
des choses sur toi.
C'est pas drôle, Lester.
J'avais jamais pensé
que ce serait aussi gros.
Toute cette putain de ville...
Oui, Jay.
Pas besoin d'élèves pour aider
au ratissage près des rues de ce mec.
Ratisser davantage m'est inutile.
Pourquoi ? Je vais te le dire.
Car je sais déjà le nom
du schnoufard disparu.
Oui, son nom, date de naissance
et son dernier refuge connu.
Lawrence Butler, 10/03/1951,
400 West Street,
refuge pour hommes de Baltimore Sud.
<i>Comment t'as obtenu toutes ces infos ?</i>
Comment ?
Travail de police.
Si des pistes
il y a, sergent, j'utiliserai
les effectifs pour enquêter.
Mais en attendant,
tu vas me lâcher, Jay ?
Oui, lâche-moi, putain.
L'ennui, quand tu en fais une priorité ?
Ils commencent à la considérer
comme une priorité.
Sors-moi de là, Lester.
Le plus vite possible.
Sénateur.
Il y a des rumeurs d'une négociation
de peine à la dernière minute.
Pourquoi négocier si je n'ai rien fait ?
Quel est votre livre, sénateur ?
Ceci ?
<i>Prométhée enchaîné</i>.
Une pièce antique,

Des mots d'Eschyle :
"Aucune bonne action
ne reste impunie."
Impossible d'exprimer la consolation
apportée par ces quelques pages.
- Une autre question...
- Messieurs-dames,
je passe devant le tribunal,
on se voit à l'intérieur.
La mairie veut des nouvelles.
Qu'avons-nous sur notre disparu ?
Quoi d'autre ?
Une copie de l'appel et le dossier
ont été envoyés à Quantico.
- Ils nous verront après l'analyse.
- Faut ratisser tous les refuges
et missions.
- T'as besoin de monde ?
- Je prends Christeson.
Le bleu ?
Il posera les questions supplémentaires.
Il est avide.
- S'il me faut du monde, je te le dirai.
- J'en doute pas.
J'ai appris, pour Christeson.
Tu l'as laissé
sur son affaire
et donné deux équipes de surveillances.
Ce que tu fais est bien.
Merci.
J'ai autre chose pour toi.
Tu te rappelles mon meurtre et viol ?
À Bolton Hill ?
Le beau-frère du violeur...
Y a un an, il voulait pas parler.
Mais sa femme vient de se faire serrer.
Si elle se fait enfermer,
ses gosses iront aux services sociaux.
Il veut un marché.
Le problème, c'est que son dossier
est à New York.
À Elmira ou Newburgh. Bref.
Une voiture, les frais payés,
et c'est conclu.
Jimmy. Il a étranglé et fourré
sous le lit une jeune de 20 ans.
OK. Utilise mon numéro pour la voiture.
Je me charge des frais et heures sup'.
Merci, vieux.
T'es le petit roi des diamants, hein ?
Finalement, je prends Norris
pour le ratissage, chef.
Dans toutes les transactions
que vous avez décrites, inspecteur,
l'argent passait
par le compte personnel du sénateur,
puis retiré en liquide.
- Oui.
- Souvent du même montant ?
Souvent le montant exact,
légèrement moins parfois, mais toujours
un jour après le dépôt initial.
Merci, inspecteur Freamon.
Votre Honneur, pas d'autres questions.
Contre-interrogatoire, M. Murphy.
Pas de questions.
Vous avez un numéro ?
Avec, je peux vous trouver une place.
Macaroni au fromage aujourd'hui.
Je suis journaliste.
Vous avez de quoi manger, alors.
Je visite simplement, pour entrer
en contact avec des sans-abri.
Pourquoi vous cherchez tout le temps
des SDF ici ?
- Vous n'en servez pas ?
- On sert tout le monde. Des SDF,
des pauvres, des gens vivotant
dans l'attente de leur salaire.
50 % du quartier vient
une semaine avant leur paye.
Vous êtes pas...
SDF ?
Non, je vis dans la cave de ma soeur,
à Edmondson Village.
Pourquoi ils vous intéressent ?
Pour les meurtres.
À propos du tueur en série.
Mais je cherche surtout un article
sur comment c'est pour eux.
Comment est leur vie.
Les temps sont durs.
Je peux pas imaginer.
Vous allez faire un article
sur comment est la vie ?
Bubbles, mec.
Mike Fletcher.
Restons pour le moment sur l'association
Baltimore Ouest Basket.
Quelles étaient
vos responsabilités de base ?
Je peux pas dire exactement.
Pourtant, vous touchiez 40 000 dollars
par an en tant que directeur général.
Non. Tout cet argent
allait aussitôt au sénateur Davis.
Rien pour vous ?
J'étais payé comme chauffeur.
Je gardais cet argent.
Quand je chopais
- de l'argent pour le sénateur...
- Objection.
- ... il m'en donnait un peu.
- Rejetez tout cela.
Accordé. Ne tenez pas compte
de la dernière remarque.
Cette affaire se limite aux charges
venant des opérations des associations
caritatives du sénateur Davis.
Tout autre sujet n'a rien à faire ici.
Nous y voilà !
Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ?
Un rendez-vous à 17 h 50 ?
Je vais surveiller Monk.
Vous avez des antécédents judiciaires,
M. Price ?
Oui, j'ai fait quelques années.
Et quand vous êtes sorti de prison
il y a six ans,
le sénateur Davis était-il au courant
de votre casier judiciaire ?
Oui.
Et pourtant, il vous a donné un travail.
Mais aujourd'hui,
c'est ainsi que vous le remerciez ?
Dans votre témoignage
sur l'argent gagné
dans les associations du sénateur,
vous dites le rendre en liquide
au sénateur.
- Est-ce correct ?
- À chaque fois.
Ainsi, il n'y a aucune preuve
que le Sénateur ait reçu cet argent,
toujours correct ?
- Je pense pas.
- Vous pensez pas.
Je pense pas.
M. Price, vous avez admis plus tôt
qu'en échange
de votre témoignage,
vous recevrez une immunité
contre des poursuites
pour toutes charges liées
à cette affaire.
Est-il juste de dire
que témoigner contre le sénateur Davis
vous assure de ne pas vous-même
aller en prison ?
- Putain que oui.
- M. Price.
Pard... Merde. Pardon.
Mea culpa, Mme le juge.
M. Price, vous attendez-vous
à ce que ce jury
croie un individu condamné deux fois
plus qu'un membre du Maryland
dûment élu au Sénat ?
Que dire ?
Pouvez faire comme vous le sentez
et me laisser en paix.
Je pige pas. Il a pas bougé
depuis une heure et demie.
<i>Reviens, alors.</i>
Il attaque les abribus
toutes les trois ou quatre nuits.
Deux blessés et un mort
depuis décembre.
Je demande juste quelques heures
pour surveiller ce connard.
Il fonctionne comme une horloge.
Assigne moi et Garvey,
trois nuits, et l'enquête est bouclée.
- Deux nuits.
- S'il attaque à la 3e ?
- Une nuit.
- Très bien, très bien.
Deux nuits.
Mets mon numéro sur les fiches
d'heures sup' et donne-les à Jay...
C'est bon. Je connais le truc.
- Tu connais ?
- Ce que tu fais est bien, chef.
Comment tu m'as appelé ?
C'est quoi ?
Les rapports.
L'interrogatoire complet
des familles de tes victimes.
Et crois-moi, ça a gâché ma semaine.
- Éprouvant, hein ?
- Je suis là-bas à expliquer
au sel de la terre pourquoi leur aîné,
qui est à la rue car ils savaient pas
comment régler ses problèmes,
mais Dieu sait qu'ils ont essayé,
pourquoi il a fini mordu et baisé
par un enculé de malade
qui s'est servi de lui pour se branler.
Comment ce truc de morsures
a pu atterrir dans les journaux, déjà ?
Je dois filer. J'ai des trucs à monter.
Tu m'avais pas parlé de ça,
hein, enculé ?
Qui est le prochain ? J'en ai un
à l'angle de Calhoun et Mosher.
La vache.
Le pauvre.
Tu veux l'emmener chez toi ?
Merde.
Emmène moi plutôt.
- Hein ?
- Je te fais marcher, mec.
Merci de m'avoir amené ici, mec,
me faire faire le tour.
Pas pour ça.
Sûr ?
Simplement...
écris comme tu le ressens.
<i>"Les côtoyer..."</i>
<i>L'odyssée de la rue du journaliste
qui a irrité un tueur en série</i>
Tu peux pas réclamer
à un client habituel toute sa note.
Ça ne se fait pas.
J'ai tenu un bar.
Je sais comment ça marche.
Gus Haynes, en chair et en os.
Un peu plus de chair, peut-être.
Tu deviens quoi ?
Toujours aux Moeurs ?
Moeurs ?
Merde alors, ça me ramène à loin.
Après 8 ans à la Crim,
je suis dans le district Ouest.
D'ailleurs, depuis quand tu viens plus ?
Dernière fois je t'ai vu...
Je parcours plus les districts.
Je suis rédac' chef, maintenant, donc...
Alors tu as de quoi payer une tournée.
Salut, Dennis.
Laisse-moi te demander un truc.
Un bail, Gus. Me dis pas
que tu savais que je serais là.
C'est un bar de flics. Si c'était pas
toi, ce serait une autre personne
de l'époque.
Question théorique.
Oh, théorique.
Dans ce cas, un double, Rodney,
Gus régale.
- Deux, Rodney.
- Ça arrive.
Bon...
Je t'ai vu à la planque, yo.
T'étais pas avec les Barksdale ?
Ton blaze, yo ?
Savino.
Oui, c'est vrai. Savino.
T'as jamais transporté de dope.
Tu faisais que garde,
d'après mes souvenirs.
Maintenant, tu fais le garde
pour Marlo, hein ?
J'étais pas là.
Quand ils lui ont fait la peau,
au vieux, j'étais pas là.
Chris et Snoop, eux qu'ont fait ça.
Je sais qui y était.
Alors, t'es innocent, hein ?
Mais laisse-moi te demander.
Vu que tu fais le garde pour Marlo,
t'aurais fait quoi si t'y étais, hein ?
Explique-moi ça.
Tu sais quoi, yo ?
<i>Prêt ?</i>
<i>Ouais.</i>
<i>OK.</i>
- Faut qu'on se parle.
- <i>Je viens te voir.</i>
C'est possible ?
Passer par le système judiciaire
avec une fausse identité ?
Peut-être la première fois,
si elle a aucun antécédent,
aucune empreinte cataloguée,
mais après ?
Les renseignements ont
des empreintes caractéristiques
qui sont comme un code-barre du FBI.
Avec en plus une photo.
Un nom, c'est une chose. Mais
à moins qu'elles soient soeur jumelles
et qu'une transporte la main de l'autre
dans son sac depuis 12 ans...
quelqu'un se paye ta tête.
C'est un code, c'est sûr.
Et ça n'a pas grand-chose à voir
avec l'heure.
À ce stade, je vais avoir besoin
de plus de personnes,
de voitures de surveillance,
d'heures de travail.
On va devoir rester sur eux jusqu'à
ce que ces horloges aient un sens.
La bonne nouvelle, c'est que j'ai
des effectifs de dispo partout.
- Et la mauvaise ?
- Je donne à tout le monde des heures
et de l'argent pour qu'ils travaillent
d'autres dossiers.
C'est plus fort que moi, Lester. Je suis
comme ça. Je donne encore et encore.
Si tu fais pas gaffe, tu vas
t'attirer des emmerdes. Nous attirer.
Qui va se plaindre ?
Les gars travaillent leurs dossiers
et sont payés.
Il te faut quoi exactement ?
Sept hommes.
Non, huit. Et voitures.
Merde alors, ils m'ont proposé
des hommes des districts
et un chef pour diriger le détachement.
Des gars de district de confiance ?
Laisse-moi y réfléchir.
<i>Putain, mais je sais pas
comment toi, tu arrives</i>
<i>à faire cette merde. Comment ?</i>
Tu as la bonne clé Allen ?
<i>Foutu mode d'emploi.</i>
Tu as pris quel genre de scotch ?
Putain !
Meuble de merde !
Yo, alors t'as parlé à Chris, hein ?
Il a dit quoi ?
Il a dit que tchi.
Il sait que j'ai dit dalle que
à aucun flic.
T'as entendu ce que le petit Dermell
a dit au juge des mineurs ?
La meuf lui demande : "Yo, t'es fiché ?"
Lui : "Taspé, j'ai tellement de fiches
que je vais sortir un album."
Touche pas à ce rif, p'tit.
C'est un coin de rue à Stanfield, hein ?
Tu sais qui je suis ?
Tu dis bien au chef
que tu sais qui a refroidi Savino
hier soir. Tu me suis ?
Tu dis à ce type
je vais refroidir tous ses gardes
tant qu'il a pas le cran
de venir dans la rue danser.
Tu vas remembrer ça, mon chou ?
C'est lui, Omar ? Putain.
Savino a clamse, yo ?
Putain, mec,
s'il avait tricard
que j'étais chez Monk l'autre soir,
je serais peut-être moi aussi à terre.
Comment il boite sa mère.
Je ne sais pas, sénateur. J'aimerais
vous croire. Je suis votre avocat.
Mais il y a tout ça ici, sur le tableau,
que M. Bond expose.
11 000 à Ouest Basket,
le lendemain, 11 000 dollars retirés,
puis un dépôt de 11 000 dollars
- dans votre compte personnel.
- Bien sûr, dans mon compte.
Ça me facilitait le travail.
Et à la fin de la journée ?
Je ne gardais pas un centime.
J'attends que vous fassiez mieux que ça,
sénateur. Où sont vos preuves papier ?
- Papier ?
- Oui, papier.
Par exemple, ce chèque de 11 000 $
daté du 22 janvier...
C'était l'hiver dernier ?
Eh bien,
une part pour payer
le gaz et l'électricité de tous,
on allait couper le chauffage
à la moitié de mon district,
et une part pour des doudounes
pour les enfants dans le besoin.
Laissez-moi vous dire un truc.
Dans mon coin, c'est la jungle.
Tout le monde vit au jour le jour,
improvise, trime,
se débrouille avec le peu qu'ils ont.
Fichtre, d'ailleurs, cette émission
télé, comment... <i>Survivor</i> ?
S'ils veulent de bons candidats,
qu'ils viennent à Baltimore Ouest.
Les gens que je connais ?
On cartonnerait.
On s'entraîne chaque jour
dans notre vie.
Fichtre, et <i>Fear Factor</i> ?
Oh, put...
- Me poussez pas.
- Pardonnez-moi,
- mais je ne vois pas en quoi...
- Laissez-moi vous dire, frère.
Je ne sais pas comment ils font
à Roland Park.
Peut-être que le procureur Obonda peut
m'éclairer là-dessus. Mais chez moi,
c'est uniquement du payer-prendre,
et je suis Clay Davis.
Les miens ont besoin d'une chose,
ils savent où me trouver.
Laissez-moi vous dire, frère.
Quand je sors, que je vais
à l'angle de Mosher et Pennsylvania,
vaut mieux que j'aie les poches pleines.
Mais le temps d'arriver
à Robert Street...
Objection ! Objection, Votre Honneur !
Sénateur. Sénateur, asseyez-vous.
Et pas d'allusions désinvoltes
envers M. Bond.
Mes excuses, Votre Honneur.
Mais ces fondations caritatives
furent créées
pour les ligues de basketball
dans les centres de loisirs ?
Oui, mais vous me donnez
20 000 pour un ballon de basket
et un compresseur,
je ne lésine pas à m'en servir
pour quoi que ce soit,
pour quiconque vienne me voir.
"Sénateur Clay,
"j'dois enterrer ma mère,
"payer la caution de mon fils,
"acheter une nouvelle chemise
pour un entretien d'embauche,
"payer le médecin
pour l'asthme de mon enfant."
Ça me prend une demi-heure
pour faire 100 mètres,
alors pardon si je n'ai pas demandé
à cette vieille femme
atteinte d'arthrite un reçu,
ou à cette jeune mère
qui avait besoin de lait maternisé
de signer un fichu bout de papier
pour ne pas avoir à me retrouver
à la barre
à expliquer à des gens qui n'ont jamais
mis les pieds dans notre coin
la réalité des choses.
Et si un jury de mes pairs, vous tous,
vous estimez juste et normal
que je sorte d'ici
en homme probe et intègre ?
Je vais pas vous mentir.
Je ferai la même chose demain,
le lendemain et le surlendemain,
jusqu'à ce qu'on m'expose
aux pompes funèbres March et qu'on
m'emmène au cimetière Mount Auburn.
Silence !
Silence dans la salle !
Pourquoi pas des caravanes ?
Comme la FEMA. Des caravanes
servant de logement temporaire
pour une partie
de la population des refuges.
Sur la place du monument aux morts.
Sais-tu combien la FEMA
paye par caravane ?
Une dizaine pour les sans-abri.
On en a 3 000 à 4 000 dans les rues,
au moins.
C'est symbolique. On fait ce qu'on peut
face au désastre local.
Comme La Nouvelle-Orléans.
Abandonnée par l'État,
ignorée par le gouvernement fédéral.
Déjà que tu veux garder
les refuges municipaux ouverts H/24.
Cela met le service de santé
de 200 000 dans le rouge.
Plus l'excédent à venir pour avoir
affranchi la police côté heures sup'
- et frais d'enquête...
- Il n'y a plus le choix.
Tout le monde ne parle que de ça.
Prochaine disparition de victime, on
sera encore plus sous les projecteurs.
Je te préviens simplement, si ceci dure
plus d'un mois, avec nos dépenses,
il faudra envisager des coupes
dans les organismes,
voire des licenciements de profs
vers la fin de l'année fiscale.
- Licenciements de profs ?
- Par un candidat au gouvernorat.
Une année d'élection.
Charmant.
Attendez, attendez.
Je tiens simplement à dire
que malgré les fausses accusations
faites à mon encontre,
le peuple, que je continue de servir,
a parlé.
Que vient-il de se passer, bordel ?
... aussi longtemps que je puisse
pour servir le peuple.
En tout cas, on ne l'apprend pas
en école de droit.
6 feuillets sur Clay Davis ne jouant pas
seulement la carte communautaire,
mais tout le jeu, envoyé.
Reçu. Merci.
Un jour, faudra
que tu m'expliques tout ça, Gus.
Après avoir assisté à ce verdict,
je me sens très blanc.
Commence par des disques
de James Brown.
Embarrassant, hein ?
J'arrive pas à croire que personne
n'ait eu le bon sens de modérer ça.
Le battage médiatique est déjà néfaste.
Mais surtout, je lui fais pas confiance.
Je le renvoie sur le terrain
pour avouer son erreur, il revient
avec une histoire d'identités volées.
Je m'en fous qu'il se fasse prendre.
Ça arrive à tous.
Comme moi.
Il s'agit de ne pas avouer.
Gus, cette histoire avec la femme
et les croquettes de crabe,
tu crois que la première fois que
tu l'attrapes, c'est sa première fois ?
Plein de personnes tenteraient
d'éviter un rectificatif.
Mais il maintenait un mensonge absolu.
Et s'il ment pour un rectificatif...
Alors, mentirait-il
pour gonfler une histoire ?
J'arrête pas de penser au jeune en
fauteuil roulant devant l'Oriole Park.
Celui dont on avait que le surnom.
Un jeune Noir de l'Ouest,
fana de baseball ?
Basketball, oui.
Football, d'accord.
Traiter un autre journaliste de menteur,
je veux vraiment pas.
Qu'y a-t-il, bébé ?
Tu arrives pas à dormir ?
Voyons voir.
Disons bonne nuit à tout le monde.
Bonne nuit, la lune.
- À toi.
- Bonne nuit, la lune.
Voilà.
Bonne nuit, les étoiles.
Bonne nuit, les condés.
Bonne nuit, les drogués.
Bonne nuit, les revendeurs.
Bonne nuit, les escrocs.
Bonne nuit, les arnaqueurs.
Bonne nuit à tout le monde.
Bonne nuit à tous autant que vous êtes.
Now they're on line.
This is masked as Marlo's cell number?
How the fuck, how?
Spoofed to imitate a call stream
like it's a phone company switch.
We can put any digits in we want.
Meanwhile,
phone company paperwork on the case
has the cell we gave to Sydnor.
It's fairly basic shit.
Now, stick
to the script.
We don't want any tell-tales.
Even with the voice modulator,
you're exposed here.
<i>Seven-baker-fourteen.</i>
<i>Bga, go ahead fourteen.</i>
<i>Fourteen. I got a vehicle
blocking an entrance.</i>
<i>Four hundred pressman.</i>
What the--
Oh, shit.
- Templeton.
- Hey, you--
Where do you get off,
you sick little twist? Sexual?
I'm not sexual with them.
I'm not abusive with them.
How dare you write that in your paper
without knowing nothing about me--
- What?
- Biting's not sex, it's biting.
I'm not sick like that.
Hang on--
Hang on, hang on.
<i>Maybe I should come bite you.</i>
Would you like that, Scotty?
I bet you would like that.
Am I right?
<i>You write about me like I'm sick.
You're the sick one, you know that?</i>
<i>Is that why you like me, Scotty?</i>
Is that why?
Fuck me--
Yeah, this is holley,
Baltimore homicide.
I need a trap-and-trace on case
oh-eight, h-one-fourteen.
Cell phone is in use right now.
<i>I could come bite you;
you tell me how sexual it is.</i>
Okay, hang on.
Who, where are you--
Here's what's happening now.
<i>You humiliate me like that?</i>
You mortify me like that
in front of my father?
My father's father?
<i>Listen to me,
smack daddy, crack daddy,</i>
<i>little baby whack daddy,</i>
Here's what's happening.
You ain't never
going to find them anymore.
You ait never
gonna see them no more.
I'm sending you something right now.
You take a good look at this guy,
<i>because you ain't never
going to see him no more.</i>
Hey, okay.
Don't hang up.
Can we--
Oh, shit.
- Did you get Mcnulty?
- Just his voicemail.
Oh, Christ.
That was--
That was him.
Again!
Nice bawlmer accent.
It's my heritage.
<i>Has traced the phone in question
to pier five on pratt street.</i>
<i>All units respond to that twenty
and detain anyone present</i>
<i>pending the arrival
of a duty officer.</i>
<i>One-baker-ten, copy that.
I'm rolling.</i>
<i>One-ker-thirteen,
I'm almost there.</i>
<i>Kga to all units.
Be advised that we're looking</i>
<i>for a ten-thirty individual
on a cell phone.</i>
Anyone on a phone?
Not that I saw. Just some people
moving through, but it could be anybody.
- Let's just fan out and take names.
- Go down this road.
Get their names over there.
- Get everybody up in this area now.
- Stop.
What the hell is this?
- Let go of me.
- Get on the ground now.
Get your hands up!
Step out!
Get everody over there
and get their cell phones.
I need everyone to take out
your cell phones
and place them on the table
in front of you.
He didn't do anything.
What are you doing?
Sarge, we got him.
- Bullshit.
- I got him on tape.
- The goof actually called.
- Yeah, yeah, it was sweet--
Hey, what'd I miss?
He went off on a tangent.
Said he wanted to bite me.
- What?
- Bite you how?
{\Scott, }Are you saying that he threatened to--
Wait a minute.
Hold on a second.
Holy Christ.
- So are we partners or what?
- No, Clay.
I don't pick so much as a single juror
without a full amount
of my fee being paid.
If you want Billy Murphy on your case,
you got to pay to put him there.
I got a taste for you right up front.
A good, five-figure taste.
But you asking for me to pay
a winner's fee right up front,
and you know what?
I ain't a winner yet.
Right now, with the sword
hanging over my head,
I don't have the kind of
financial support at my disposal
that I would ordinarily be able
to rely upon, you feel?
So the money boys are laying off{\, huh}?
Oh, they thinkin' short
when they should be thinkin' long.
Shameful shit.
25,000, 25,000 more
when you seat a jury.
I don't work that way.
I know you don't, partner,
I know you don't.
And normally, I wouldn't dream
of asking you to suit up
for game day with my tab, as it is.
200,000
when I get you out
from under this mess.
And Clay,
don't fuck me.
Don't even think about fucking me
out of a single part of that fee.
Oh, Billy, you talk
as if you don't know me.
I'm disappointed.
I am.
My brother, let's be fair.
I'm providing you
with the opportunity
to go head to head
with the state's attorney
in a case that's gonna be
front page news.
For all that profile?
Sheet, partner,
you should be payin' me a fee.
Seriously, dawg, for 20,000
cash to my campaign committee,
I'll get myself indicted federal,
let you go to trial on that.
Beat the feds like a stepchild,
an' really make a name for yourself.
Fuck you?
Naw, son,
I'm gonna make you.
Motherfuckers gonna be wipin' they ass
with Johnnie Cochran's memory,
and carryin' your business card
in every damn pocket before we done.
No.
I already got more rep
than any lawyer would ever nee
why don't you save that silver-tongued
bullshit for the jury?
Right.
No, nothing since.
Alright.
Me, Barlow and Kincaid
been sittin' here
like the fucking maytag repairmen,
growing piles.
- Nothing, not a call. Then, bang.
- No luck at the harbor.
We were tracking the G.P.S. then
it just goes dead. Area of pier five.
- Where's Mcnulty right now?
- He's over at the newspaper.
Let's hear that motherfucker again.
<i>Hey, you-- </i>
<i>Where do you get off,
you sick little twist?</i>
Sounds like some gearhead
from dundalk.
And emotionally,
how was he?
- He sounded pissed.
- At you, personally?
Like I told you,
he said I humiliated him
by writing that the biting was sexual.
At the end, he offered
to come here and bite me.
I didn't really respond to that.
- Did he sound like the same guy?
- What do you mean?
Did it sound like the same voice
you heard on the first call?
Right. Yeah.
No, actually.
Yeah.
I mean, yeah.
It was the same,
but this time I noticed
he had a real thick bawlmer accent.
Real thick.
You didn't notice
that theirst time, huh?
I guess I did, but I forgot.
- Did I screw up in any way?
- No. Not at all.
Listen, we reserve the right
to make this decision,
but that said,
would running these photos
in any way impair the investigation?
I don't think so.
Fact is, we need as many eyes as we can
looking for this homeless guy.
- You don't know where is guy is, huh?
- He could be--
Could already be a victim, sure.
Jesus.
That's Charles and Conway.
I wonder if he's a regular out there.
He had to have used
a different phone{\though}.
Had to be{\have been} a cell phone
if he sent you these.
That's true. But...
again, you can't print
anything about where
he's calling from.
We're trying to get up
on that cell phone.
What should I do if he calls again?
Keep him on the line
as long as you can.
Don't spook him.
Guy likes to rant. Let him do his thing.
You okay?
- Me?
- Yeah, I guess.
I wouldn't worry;
he's just using you. He needs you.
I kind of resent that, actually.
I dunno. It's workin' out pretty well
for both of you, right?
Gentlemen--
Thanks for these.
Callin' Vincent on his cell all morning,
he still ain't answer.
Ain't got time for this.
Re-up time will come due,
we still ain't picked up the mannitol.
What the fuck?
Yo, Vincent.
Where you at?
Manny?
Shit.
- Omar.
- Why you still alive then?
He say tell Marlo
he out in the streets, waitin'.
Say this whole damn city gonna know
Marlo ain't man enough
to come down in the streets.
- He get the stash?
- Yo, Cherry.
He blew Manny up
as soon as he got inside.
He was gonna do me, too.
How the fuck he get inside?
Manny open up
to go on the food run,
an' this dicksucker
was right there.
He knew we was the stash.
Ain't need to be told shit.
He just knew.
Four key of raw; flushed.
Hey, yo, Cherry.
You gonna untie me, right?
C'mon, nigga,
untie me--
Seriously, Steven.
If you can't afford it,
that's fine, I understand.
And if you think this clown is gonna
hold me off and keep the statehouse,
{\then }I know you have to hedge your bets given
how much you're waiting on fm Annapolis.
{\But }If you're gonna choose a side
on this thing, please, do it early.
- That's all I'm saying.
- <i>I hear ya, Tom</i>.
<i>You know what, I'm going to write out
a check today, and send it out the door.</i>
That's great, Steven;
really, I do appreciate it.
Can you...
Can I ask you to consider--
<i>I'll double down on that
for my wife, too.</i>
For your wife, too.
That's just great, really.
Yeah. Thanks
for going the extra mile on this.
<i>No problem, Tom.</i>
Photographs?
He messaged digital photos
of the possible victim
to the <i>Sun</i> reporter.
I've canvassed this guy's
regular corner,
and he has indeed
been missing a couple days.
We got these photos from the newspaper,
but we want to be able
to intercept {\any }future images--
Hence the amended order.
Correct.
Can we catch photos
with our city equipment?
Actually, no. We're still bumping around
in the 20th century.
But Howard County has the right software
on a couple of their computers.
You need two?
Yeah, in case one computer goes down,
we got the other one as back-up.
We don't wanna Miss our shot
at this nut.
Well, good hunting.
Thank you, judge.
Oh, Ronnie.
You briefed your boss?
And he's calling the Mayor, right?
And Rawls too, I imagine.
Pretty little fella
gets himself elected
on a law and order ticket.
Crime doesn't go down much,
and then,
a couple weeks before he starts
gearing up to announce for governor,
some wingnut starts killing people,
taking photographs,
sending 'em to the newspaper.
You know something? You may wanna check
the Governor's alibi.
You know?
Thanks.
You couldn't make thirty?
Twenty?
Ninety-two.
I'm gonna tell you something.
There are a lot of people
who want Tommy Carcetti
to be their fuckin' Governor.
And I can't imagine
what they're thinking.
Ninety-two, Norman, in a single morning.
It is a new record.
The motherfucker
killing homeless guys?
He grabbed one{\ off the street},
wrapped a ribbon on his wrist,
sent a photo to the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>,
saying we won't find the body.
He--what?
The newspaper's
gonna run the photos.
Bill Rawls.
I need him on the line now.
* you rascal you
* I'll be glad when you're dead,
you rascal you *
Look at ya,
ya baby-bumpin' motherfucker.
Look at you.
Let's go.
Deputy wants as much of my squad
as I can wrangle upstairs right now.
We're going large Richard
on Mcnulty's serial killer.
I'm working my cases.
Bunk,
command performance.
The deputy wants bodies.
The Mayor's spewing over this thing.
I'm not going.
What?
You don't see those on my sleeve?
- Plain as fuckin' day, Bunk.
- I'm doing police work here.
In fact, I have a fresh angle
on last year's Major case,
on which I'm the sole
remaining investigator.
So fuck your stripes
and fuck Mcnulty,
and fuck your big-dick red ball.
If you can't work with that,
then just write me the fuck up,
and ship my ass to a trial board.
So, for starters, Alma stays with the
investigation, and detectives downtown.
You don't go home
without checking for updates
before the e-dot
and double-dot editions.
So the case file is Mcnulty,
with the rest of his squad
as immediate support.
Lieutenant d'Addario's shift
will man the wiretap.
In addition to Alma and Scott,
Olesker will have a column coming.
Fletcher, I want you
on homeless react,
also interviews with advocates
and experts talking up the problem.
Melody, you get on the phone
with the whitecoats
at Clifton T. Perkins or wherever,
and work up a sidebar on what it means
when a whackjob kills somebody and wants
to talk to reporters about it.
Greg, I've been scanning the casework,
and I note that while there have been
numerous field interviews and canvasses;
we haven't done much
with background work
on victims and families.
If you could take charge of that--
Colonel Tomlin,
we're going to need tactical
to provide surveillance cars
and undercover decoys
where the homeless gather.
We need to be in the street, proactive.
This case is as much
about preventing another
abduction or murder
as it is about making an arrest--
Thing is, we can't work
this one with the phone.
We need to be in the street,
at eye level--
We need to keep the media
as part of the equation.
This reporter that's been contacted--
He's in the middle of it.
That may be a way
to solve this thing.
You're in the middle this{\ now}, so while
we're still going to present this
as a first-person piece
on your latest contact with the killer,
Alma's still going to interview
you for the mainbar.
{\Now, }Mcnulty's preliminary checks
with shelter workers,
and a canvass of Conway and Charles,
indicates that our victim
is indeed missing,
but when we get a full I.D.,
we need toun every connection
to make sure this isn't a hoax.
Chief, we're going to need
to pull bodies from district ops
to give homicide
their own surveillance arm.
And having had some experience
in the politics of staffing,
I leave it to Mcnulty
to pick the people.
For once, people, I am assured
that the resources we need
to work this story will be there for us.
So let's surround this mess
and report the hell out of it.
This one's got legs.
I am now told,
by the Mayor directly,
that there will be
no overtime restrictions,
no staffing limits on this case.
So put this case down.
Police work.
Whaddaya know?
Good day.
Six g-packs so far.
New package be
droppin' them fiends.
Yeah.
Probably need one more re-up.
Career day on the corner, hanh?
Step off, nigga.
Hey, Mike, check this out.
"Certified hydrotherapist,
"experience with geri-atric patients,
- Sinai hospital outpatient clinic."
- Jerry who?
Whatever, how about this--
"dental front desk,
high quality dental office
seeks front desk."
- What do they mean, like furniture?
- Like a secretary, I guess.
Man, you ain't even
ever been to no dentist.
"Huhvac maintenance
supervisor."
What the fuck is a huhvac?
"H-V-A-C."
Maybe they spelled it bad.
"Systems manager
in a deadline driven environment."
Man, ain't nothing there.
And even if there was,
you ain't sixteen,
and y'all got to pick up Bug
after three--
Hang on--
"Exotic dancer, downtown
financial district lunch time hours--
Must be flexible in body and mind."
Now we talking--
Make it rain on 'em.
Make it rain.
- Hold up.
- Time out.
Fuck did I do?
If we don't know,
then you do.
This is bullshit.
Yo, don't forget about Bug.
As this is an ongoing investigation,
I'm going to ask
that you direct questions
to the police officials
best equipped to answer.
These new developments in the case
of the homeless slayings in our city
are troubling and tragic
and unacceptable.
We are now doing everything possible
to locate and identify the individual
depicted in the photographs
sent to the "Baltimore Sun" today.
We are endeavoring to protect
other homeless citizens,
and we are pursuing the suspect
with every means at our disposal.
I have made clear
to my police commanders
that they have my full confidence
and the authority to employ
whatever resources they require.
And let mee unequivocal--
this man will be brought to justice.
Thank you.
Mr. Mayor--
Mr. Mayor--
Voice and digital photos.
He calls again,
you'll capture either one.
I can do those background checks myself,
- there's no need to--
- You heard the deputy.
He specifically assigned Greggs.
- Greggs has an open triple.
- And this squad has your serial killer,
- and the case is shit-hot.
- I don't need--
You are the point man
on the motherfucker who's now missing.
You don't have time to be working
backgrounds on the older cases.
It goes to greggs;
end of fucking story.
Now...
What else do you need?
I'm gonna need those surveillance teams
{\as this thing sprawls},
but for right now,
let me pull his{\this guy's} I.D.
as fast as I can,
figure what he's about.
{\And }After that, I'll have more to spin off.
- Voice analysis of the call?
- Shit, I don't believe in that shit.
Next thing I know, you'll want me to go
to {\fucking }Quantico with this fucking thing.
As a matter of fact--
You don't believe in behavioral
forensics, Dr. Moreland?
I don't believe in much
of anything at this point.
{\Well, }It doesn't fucking matter
what any of us believe at this point.
You turned on the fuckin' tap, Jimmy.
They're finally paying
for police work again.
Proud of yourselves?
We're close to Marlo.
A week or two at most.
How does it feel
getting Greggs pulled off her triple?
How does it feel knowing that you got
surveillance teams out there,
and district units, and tactical--
All of 'em chasin' bullshit.
We're gonna use the surveillance teams,{\ actually.}
They're gonna help us bring in the case.
I don't even want to know whose picture
you got running in the paper,
or where that motherfucker
actually happens to be.
Names and addresses;
whater you got.
Don't kill yourself.
Shit.
Don't worry, son.
I got you covered on all this.
Listen, one other thing.
I'm getting' my kid for an overnight.
Where do I get kid's furniture?
Ikea.
See y'all.
Shame on y'all.
I mean it.
- <i>Trace lab.</i>
- It's Moreland.
<i>You just called.</i>
I know,
and I'm callin' again.
I need the tracework on oh-six-h-
two-seven-one,
and I need it now.
<i>I know, he hasn't been
around to it yet.</i>
Well, tell him I called,
and tell him I'm gonna keep calling
until he feels
my fucking pain, a-ight?
Gift-wrapped.
Number one.
Fuck.
How the fuck do they expect me
to get this shit done on my own?
Broke ass department
ain't even payin'--
You okay?
It's fucked up.
It's all fucked up, okay?
I could make a red go to black
'cept for these cheap motherfuckers--
Whaddaya got?
Good snitch put the finger on an eyeball
wit been duckin' me.
He lays up at this one girl's place
at Athol avenue, right?
Comes in late,
but he leaves early.
- So?
- So I don't mind
sittin' on the place all night long
an' not get paid.
But it's a garden apartment.
Parking lots on both sides,
and if he decides to park on the street
and walk across the grass,
he still has the fucking patio doors.
Two more men do it?
Yeah, and two more cars, yeah.
I got more bodies
than I can use on my serial{\ thing}.
Lemme make a call,
hook you up with two tac guys.
You tell 'em you're sitting
on a twenty{\that} I gave you.
I'll write up the hours under my file.
And you can do that?
Go with God.
Can you make out
who that is?
Yeah.
Look at you.
Not even blinking.
Not that I blame you
after what this heinous
motherfucker did to you.
Still, this right here
is vicious.
Whoever did this had a real time;
now you know what I'm saying?
Now,
I know it wasn't you
because with all due respect,
you don't have the physicality
to do this kind of damage.
I mean, whoever did this
had to be a full-grown
and powerful individual--
A fearsome individual--
You see what I'm sayin'?
You the murder police.
How the fuck would I know?
- Is this spot good for a stand-up?
- Let's go with a wide shot on this.
...say they are hopeful
thathe renewed attention
to their son's death a few years ago
will lead police to--
Kinda formula, I know.
Anecdotal lede,
nut graf, best quote--
It works as a sidebar, but for tomorrow,
let's stretch it some, huh?
Really spend some time with
some of these people, you know?
What I mean is, sometimes,
the weakest stuff in a story
is the shit with
quotation marks around it.
You got a guy telling how rough it is
on the street{\, it really} doesn't have much pull.
But if you can describe him
as he really is,
tell his story in moments.
Look, tomorrow,
get back in the shelters,
and the soup kitchens,
and just be with folk.
I don't even care
if you file copy on it.
{\I mean, }if something presents itself as a story,
great, but if not,
just spend the day being with people.
I'm not interested in what
can be quoted or counted on this one.
I'm interested in what feels true.
I'm in, thirty inches,
with room
for Price's stuff from the hall.
- Scott?
- Five minutes.
- We're coming up on first edition.
- Three minutes.
We had him in that,
what do you call it,
- rehabilitation--
- Four times.
We're not rich people.
Henry's on disability.
We get him out,
he makes all kinds of promises,
but, well, you know--
I'm sorry.
The last time,
we decided
we wouldn't be there for him.
We knew he'd probably die out there;
if the drugs get him,
we knew that.
But this thing in the newspaper,
this sex stuff.
The biting or whatever.
Nobody deserves that.
You see what I have
a problem with, right?
The first-person is one thing. I know
he needs to put himself in the story--
It's essential.
But this business about him
being out there day and night
with the homeless--
this stuff about sharing their--
Quote, darkest corners
with them, unquote--
He's writing more as an essayist.
We've got a column
from olesker, front metro.
I mean, it's pretty powerful
without being purple.
But this stuff that Scott's written,
it makes it sound like he's been
living with the homeless for weeks.
He spends one night
under the J.F.X.,
another half day quoting people
in a homeless shelter.
It ain't exactly studs terkel.
You don't think the piece
should run as it is?
We have him interviewed about the call
from the killer in Alma's mainbar.
We have his quotes.
But the rest of this stuff,
he's acting like
he's taking his life in his hands,
he walks another highway at night?
This is our fucking city.
This ain't Beirut.
I respect your concerns.
I'll take the piece and move it
as my own edit. How's that?
Okay.
<i>And while they declined
to talk on camera,</i>
<i>the parents of Jonathan Boland
say they are hopeful</i>
<i>that the renewed attention
to their son's death a few yes ago</i>
<i>will lead police to his killer.</i>
<i>For Channel Six News,
I'm Patricia--</i>
Media's going crazy.
City hall, too.
But for once, we're getting
what we need to do the job.
- How does it feel?
- Forbidden.
I feel like at any moment,
they're gonna find out how much
we're spending and shut us down.
You don't have all this
in your head yet?
I just want to go over it all again.
We finish voir dire by lunch,
and then,
it's opening arguments.
For Mr. Bond.
It's on him.
He needs
a strong second.
He needs me to know
this case inside and out.
How much longer, Lester?
If Marlo has a code,
we can break the code.
That's a given.
How long?
Depends on the code,
doesn't it?
Quicker we bring this in
and shut it down,
the safer we'll all be.
I mean, Landsman wants me
to go to fucking Quantico,
let the F.B.I. do a profile.
Might learn something
about yourself.
It's not funny, Lester.
This shit's bigger than
I ever thought it would be.
The whole fuckin' city--
Yeah, Jay.
I don't need an academy class
to help with a canvass
near this guy's corners.
I don't need any additional canvassing.
What? You wanna know why?
I'll tell you why.
Because I already know the name
of the missing smokehound.
Yeah, his name, his D.O.B.
and his last known address
at a city shelter.
Lawrence Butler,
3/10/1951,
400 West street,
south Baltimore men's shelter.
How did you get all of that?
How?
Police work.
When I have more leads, Sergeant,
I'll be able to use the extra manpower
you give me and run this shit down.
But until then,
will you back off, Jay?
Yeah,
just back the fuck off.
Trouble with making this thing
into a red ball?
People started treating it
like a fucking red ball.
Jesus!
Get me out of this, Lester.
As fast as you can.
Senator--
Senator, there have been rumors
of a last minute plea offer.
How can I plead
to what I didn't do?
- What're you reading there, Senator?
- This here?
"Prometheus bound,"
an ancient play,
one of the oldest we have,
about a simple man who was
horrifically punished
by the powers that be
for the terrible crime of trying
to bring light to the common people.
In the words of Aeschylus,
"no good deed goes unpunished."
I cannot tell you how much
consolation I find in these slim pages.
- One more question--
- Ladies and gentlemen,
I do believe I have my day in court
and I will see you inside.
City Hall wants an update.
What do we know
about our missing mope?
What else?
Sending a tape of the call
down to Quantico,
along with the case file.
They'll review, then meet with us.
You gotta hit every downtown shelter
or mission there is--
- You want bodies for that?
- I'm taking Christeson.
The rookie?
Yeah, he'll ask the extra question.
He's hungry. He's--
I need more bodies,
I'll let you know.
Heard what you did with Christeson,
letting him go on his own case,
while you carry him
and two surveillance teams.
Your shit is right, Jimmy.
Thanks.
So I got another one for ya.
You remember the rape-murder I had?
Bolton hill job?
Brother-in-law of my rapist--
Last year wouldn't talk to me,
but now, his wife just got collared,
and if she gets locked up,
his kids go to family services,
so he's desperate to deal.
The problem is,
he's in the new york system--
Elmira, Newburgh,
one of those places.
Anyway, I get a road car
and expenses, I can put it down.
He strangled a 20-year-old,
stuffed her under her bed.
Okay, give my C.C. to motor pool.
I'll bury the expenses
and the O.T. in my file.
Thanks, brother.
Ain't you the lil' king of diamonds.
Homicide.
Naw, he's on the street right now.
Call back in a couple hours.
On second thought,
gonna have Norris with me
on that canvass today, boss.
And with every single transaction
you've described, detective,
the money was routed through
the Senator's personal account
and then withdrawn as cash--
- Yes, sir.
- Often
in the same amounts?
Often the exact amounts,
sometimes slightly smaller amounts,
but always
within a day of the initial deposit.
Thank you, detective Freamon.
Your Honor, no further questions.
Cross examination, Mr. Murphy.
No questions, Your Honor.
You got a number?
- What?
- Number on a slip.
If you get one, I might could find you
a seat. It's mac an' cheese today.
I'm a newspaper reporter.
So you got what to eat then.
Came down here just to hang out,
and get with some homeless people.
How come whenever y'all be wanting
homeless, y'all come to soup kitchens?
- You don't serve homeless?
- Serve everybody.
Homeless, poor folks,
workin' people tryin' to make it
to a paycheck.
Shit, half the neighborhood
be up here week before check day.
You're not--
Homeless?
No, I'm down in my sister's basement,
over at Edmondson village.
What you need the homeless to say?
Talk about the killings.
The thing going on
with the serial killer.
But mostly, I'm just lookin' for a story
about what it's like for them.
What life is like.
Hard times out here.
I can't imagine.
You gonna write a story
about what life's like, huh?
Bubbles, man.
Michael fletcher.
Sticking for the moment
with the west Baltimore hoops charity,
what were your basic
responsibilities there?
I can't rightly say.
Yet, you drew $40,000 a year
as the executive direcr.
Nah. All that money
went straight back to Senator Davis.
None for you?
I got paid through the district office
for drivin' him.
That money I kept. Whenever
I would go out to snatch some money
- for the senator--
- Objection.
- Sometimes kick me back a few.
- Move to strike all of that.
Sustained.
Disregard that last comment.
This case is limited to the charges
stemming from the operation
of Senator Davis' non-profit charities.
Other matters are not relevant.
Here it is.
What the hell is that--
A meet at five-fifty?
I'm gonna go get up on Monk.
You have a criminal history;
do you not, Mr. Price?
Yeah, I did some years.
And when you last
got out of prison six years ago,
was Senator Davis aware
of your criminal record?
Yes, sir.
And yet, he gave you a job,
but today, is this how you repay him?
The testimony you gave
about returning the money you earned
at the senator's charities,
you say you repaid it
to the senator in cash,
- correct?
- Every time.
So there's no proof
that the senator ever
received that money, isn't that correct?
- I guess not.
- You guess not.
I guess not.
Mr. Price, you acknowledged earlier
that in exchange
for your testimony,
you received immunity
from prosecution
for any charges related to this case.
Is it fair to say
that testifying against senator Davis
ensures that you will not
yourself go to jail?
- Got-damn right.
- Mr. Price.
I'm sorr--
Oh shit, sorry--
Okay, my b, judge.
Sorry.
Do you expect this jury
to take the word
of a twice-convicted felon
over the word of a duly elected member
of the Maryland state Senate?
What can I say?
Y'all can play it like you feel
an' leave me be.
I don't get it. He hasn't moved
off this spot for an hour and a half.
<i>Alright, well,
come on back then, alright?</i>
Guy's been hitting the bus shelters
every third or fourth night.
We got two wounded and one dead
going back to that piece since December.
All I'm asking is for hours
to stake this asshole out.
Guy's like clockwork.
Spot me an' garvey,
three nights
and the case is fuckin' down.
- I can give you two nights.
- If he hits on the third?
- One night.
- Okay, okay.
Two nights.
You need to put my C.C. number on
the OT slips and you give those to Jay--
It's cool.
I know the drill.
- You do?
- You're doing good here, boss--
What did you just call me?
- What the hell is that?
- Office reports.
Families of your victims,
debriefed in full.
And believe me,
it ruined my week.
- Rough, huh?
- I'm sittin' there explaining
to the salt of the fuckin' earth
why their eldest,
who is living on the street because
nothing they did could fix his problems,
but God knows they tried--
Why he met his end
being bit on and fucked with
by some sick motherfucker
who used him for jerk-off purposes.
How the shit about the bite marks
get in the papers in the first place?
Gotta run.
I got shit to assemble.
You didn't tell me that part of it,
did you, motherfucker?
Who's up next?
I got one at the corner
of Calhoun and Mosher.
Jesus--
That poor guy.
Wanna take him home with you?
Shit.
Take me.
- What?
- I'm just having fun with you, man.
Thanks for bringing me here, man,
showing me around.
Nah.
- Not about that.
- Sure?
Just--
Write it like it feels.
Fuck.
Shit!
Rodney, you can't press
a regular for his whole tab.
It just isn't done.
I used to run a bar.
I know how these things work, remember?
Gus Haynes, in the flesh.
Well, more of it maybe.
How the hell you been?
Where you been hidin'? In vice still?
Vice? Shit,
that does take me back.
I did eight years in homicide, brother.
Now it's the western.
Speaking of hiding out,
when you stop comin' round?
Last I saw you was--
I'm not running the districts anymore.
I'm an editor now, so--
Then you can afford to buy a round.
Hey, dennis.
Let me pull your coat.
Long time, Gus. Don't tell me
you knew I'd be here tonight.
It's a cop bar, you know,
so, if it's not you,
it's some other face
from back in the day.
Theoretical question.
Oh, theoretical.
In that case, a double, Rodney,
Gus is buyin'.
Two, Rodney.
So...
What?
I seen you at the stash house, yo.
Ain't you used to be
with them Barksdale boys?
What they call you, yo?
Savino.
That's right. Savino.
You ain't never moved no dope.
You was always muscle as I recall.
Now you musclin' for Marlo, huh?
I wasn't there.
When they did the old man
like that, I wasn't there.
Chris an' Snoop,
they on that.
Oh, I know who was there.
So you innocent, huh?
Let me ask you somethin' though.
Bein' that you muscle for Marlo,
what you was gonna do
if you was there, huh?
Riddle me that.
Yeah.
You know what, yo?
<i>Ready?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>A-ight.</i>
- We got to talk.
- <i>I'll come over to you.</i>
Does that seem possible?
To go through the court system
with a false I.D.?
Maybe the first time,
if she's got no priors,
no prints on file,
but after that?
B.P.I. sheets have
fingerprint characteristics
that are like an F.B.I. bar code.
And it's paired with a photo.
A name's one thing.
But unless these women are twin sisters
and one's been carrying
the other one's hand around in her purse
for the last twelve years--
Somebody's yanking your chain.
It's definitely a code.
Definitely not having
much to do with time.
We're at a point where
I'm going to need more bodies,
surveillance cars,
man hours.
We're gonna have to stay on these guys
until those clocks start to make sense.
Well, good news is they giving me
more manpower than I can waste.
Bad news?
It's all around the office
that I'm giving out hours
and money to people
to work other cases.
I can't help it, Lester.
It's the kind of person I am.
- I give and give and give--
- If you're not careful,
you're gonna get shit on you,
on us.
Who's gonna complain?
Guys are working cases
and getting paid--
So what exactly do you need?
Seven men.
No, eight.
And cars.
Oh shit, they offered me
men from the districts,
and a surveillance supervisor
to run the detail.
Anyone in the districts we trust?
Lemme think on that.
<i>I don't know how the fuck
did you of all people do this shit, huh?</i>
- <i>How?
</i>- You got the right allen wrench?
<i>God damn directions.</i>
What kind of scotch you using?
Fuck!
Piece of shit!
Yo, so you talked to Chris, right?
What he say?
He didn't say shit.
He knows I ain't say
a fuckin' word to no police.
And you heard what little Dermell
said to the juvenile master?
Lady ax him like,
"yo, you got a record?"
He's like "yeah, bitch,
My record's so long
I'm about to put out an album."
Don't touch that dial, young'un.
This a Stanfield corner, huh?
You know who I am?
You make sure you tell the boss man
that you know who it is
dropped Savino last night.
Ya feel me?
You tell that man
I'm a drop all his muscle
until he get the heart to come
down to the street and dance.
You gonna remone that, sweetpea?
That's Omar?
Damn.
Savino dead, yo?
Shit, man,
if he'da made me
from Monk's apartment the other night,
I might be laid out my own self.
Gimpy as a motherfucker.
I don't know, senator. I want
to believe you. I mean, I'm your lawyer.
But there's all this up on the board
that Mr. Bond has on display--
$11,000 to west side hoops,
next day, $11,000 drawn,
then $11,000 deposited in your personal
banking account--
You bet it all went into my account.
It made it easier for me to do my job.
And at the end of the day?
Not one penny stayed with me.
I need you to do better than that,
Senator. Where are your records?
- Records?
- Yes, records.
For example, this check for $11,000
- dated january 22nd--
- That was last winter, right?
So,
some went to pay everyone's B.G.E.,
'cause half my district
was gonna have the heat turned off,
and then, some went for puff jackets
for them that got children in need.
Let me tell you something, man.
My neck of the woods,
it's a jungle out there.
Everybody living hand to mouth,
improvising, hustlin',
make do with as little
as you can imagine.
Hell, that, that tv show,
what's that,
"Survivor"?
Man, they want some good contestants,
they need to come around westside.
Folks I know?
Oh, we'd do great on that show.
Practice every damn day of our lives.
Hell, and "Fear factor"?
Oh, sheee--
Don't even get me started.
Forgive me, but I still don't understand
how that justifies--
Let me tell you something, brother--
I don't know how they do it
out in Roland park--
Maybe prosecutor Obonda
can enlighten me on that.
But my world is strictly
cash and carry,
and I am Clay Davis.
My people need something,
they know where to find me.
Let me tell you, brother,
I step out the door,
hit the corner of Mosher
and Pennsylvania,
you better believe
my pockets are bulging.
But by the time
I get to Robert street--
Objection!
Objection, Your Honor.
Senator! Senator, take a seat,
and refrain from off-hand
references to Mr. Bond.
My apologies, Your Honor.
But these charities were set up for
basketball leagues
in city rec centers, weren't they?
Yeah, but you give me
20,000 or a basketball
and an air pump,
I am pullin' goodly on that
for whatever,
whoever comes at me.
"Senator Clay,
I gots to bury my mother,
"bail out my son,
"buy a new shirt for a job interview,
pay my child's asthma doctor."
Takes me half an hour
to go a hundred yards,
and excuse me if I didn't ask that
old Arthur-itised woman for a receipt,
or that young mother
needed the similac
to sign a damned piece a paper
so I don't have to be up here
in this box right now
explainin' to folks who never
been in our neck of the woods
how things truly are.
And if a jury of my peers,
you all deem it right and true
for me to walk out of here
an upright and justified man?
Oh, I ain't gonna lie to you.
I'm a gonna do
the same damn thing tomorrow,
and the day after that
and the day after that,
until they got me laid out
at march's funeral home,
and truck me off to mt. Auburn.
Silence.
Silence in this courtroom.
What about trailers?
Like fema. We set up trailers to act
as temp housing for some of the--
Some of the shelter popution.
You know, put 'em down
in war memorial plaza.
Do you know how much
fema pays per trailer?
A dozen trailers for the homeless.
We've got three to four thousand
on the streets, at least.
It's symbolic. You know, we're doing
what we can with a civic disaster--
- Like new orleans--
- Abandoned by the state,
ignored by the federal government.
It's bad enough you want to
keep the city shelters open 24/7.
That puts the health department
a couple hundred thousand in the red.
You add that to the overage
we're gonna see
for letting the police {\department }run wild
with overtime and investigative costs--
There's no choice anymore.
This thing has a lock
on everyone's attention.
When another victim disappears,
we're gonna be even more on the spot.
I'm just telling you,
if this goes on more than a month,
with what we'll be spending,
you're looking at cutbacks
throughout the agencies;
maybe even teacher layoffs
come the end of the fiscal.
- Teacher layoffs...
- By a gubernatorial candidate...
In an election year.
Lovely.
Hold up, hold up.
I just want to say that--
despite all the false
accusations made against me,
the people who I continue
to serve have spoken.
What the fuck just happened?
...as long as I can
to serve the people.
Whatever it was,
they don't teach it in law school.
45 inches of Clay Davis
playing not just the race card,
but the whole deck, coming at ya.
Got it.
Thank ye.
Someday you're going to have
to explain all this to me, gus.
After watching that verdict come in,
I feel very white.
Start with some James Brown records
and work up from there.
It's embarrassing, ain't it?
I can't believe nobody
had sense enough to tone this down.
The hype is bad enough. But what gets me
is that I can't trust the guy.
I send him back out onto the street
to own his mistake,
he comes back with some bullshit
about stolen identities.
I don't give a fuck he gets took.
Everybody gets took now and then.
I know I did.
It's about not owning up to it.
Gus, this thing with
the woman and the crab cake?
You think the first time you catch him
is the first time he does it?
Lotta guys'll try to duck a correction.
But the thing with this is,
he was standing on an outright lie.
And if he'll lie about a correction--
Then will he lie to make a story
better than it ought to be?
I keep thinking about that kid in the
wheelchair out in front of Oriole park.
The one that only had a nickname.
A black kid from the westside,
crazy for baseball?
Basketball, yeah.
Football--sure
I don't wanna call
another reporter a liar.
I really don't.
What's the matter, baby?
You can't sleep?
Let's see--
Let's say good night to everybody.
Good night, moon.
- You say it.
- Good night, moon.
There you go.
Good night, stars.
good night, po-pos.
Good night, fiends.
Good night, hoppers.
Good night, hustlers.
Good night, scammers.
Good night to everybody.
Good night to one and all.

Comme vous pouvez le voir,
le tueur agit principalement
dans les districts sud,
centre et sud-est.
Ce qui est sensé vu la concentration
de sans-abri dans ces districts.
Les victimes 1 et 3 ont été tuées
de nuit, les 2 et 4 de jour.
Inspecteur,
qu'en est-il du disparu, M. Butler ?
Aucune piste sur où il se trouve ?
Non, monsieur.
Nous avons un télex avec toutes
les agences de police médio-atlantiques.
Les morgues sont vérifiées chaque jour
dans 10 États et le district, mais...
- rien pour le moment.
- Un profil ?
J'ai convenu
d'un rendez-vous à Quantico.
Le FBI est très conciliant.
Ce cas est étrange.
Les attaques sur les gens de la rue
sont souvent du sadisme d'ados.
- Ce truc sexuel...
- C'est différent.
Vi-CAP ne donne aucun équivalent
dans le pays.
Un peu de perversité
de temps en temps, d'accord,
mais mordre un SDF ?
Vous semblez bien connaître l'affaire,
inspecteur.
- Que vous faut-il d'autre ?
- Nous avons une liste préliminaire
d'hommes brièvement détenus
par la police près de la jetée 5
peu après le dernier appel du suspect.
On aimerait placer certains
sous surveillance.
Ce ne sont pas des suspects,
mais des personnes d'intérêt.
On a aussi formé
une liste d'adultes Blancs
délinquants sexuels homosexuels
dans ces trois districts.
Dès qu'on aura réduit la liste,
on aimerait
en placer sous surveillance également.
- Une douzaine d'hommes.
- Moins, en fait.
Une enquête rétroactive
devrait en éliminer plusieurs.
- Vous avez des gens ?
- J'ai demandé au chef des patrouilles
de détacher le sergent Ellis Carver
à la Criminelle
pour mener les surveillances.
Pas quelqu'un
d'un des districts touchés ?
J'ai déjà travaillé avec Carver
sur de longues enquêtes par le passé,
et sa familiarité de la surveillance
est adéquate.
Je fais aussi confiance
à son objectivité
- pour le choix des équipes.
- Très bien.
Si ça marche pour les patrouilles,
ça marche pour les opérations.
Que fait-on
pour la protection des gens ?
Les patrouilles et les équipes tactiques
sont plus présentes,
spécialement où les sans-abri
se réunissent.
Dix agents habillés en clochards
se relaient.
Il va nous falloir aussi
de bonnes voitures d'infiltration.
Mais...
la Centrale des véhicules
n'aura rien de Dickman Street avant...
- Tout ce que vous voulez.
- Mais les Travaux publics...
Allez chez Avis ou Hertz s'il faut.
Je m'en fous. Des gens disparaissent.
Ils meurent, bon Dieu.
Faites ce qu'il faut.
La mauvaise nouvelle, messieurs,
est qu'on va devoir
attraper cet enculé.
La bonne est que notre maire
a enfin besoin d'une police
plus que d'un système scolaire.
{\c&HFFFFFF&}<i>When you walk through the garden</i>
{\c&HFFFFFF&}<i>You gotta watch your back</i>
{\c&HFFFFFF&}<i>Well, I beg your pardon</i>
{\c&HFFFFFF&}<i>Walk the straight and narrow track</i>

{\c&HFFFFFF&}<b>CLARIFICATIONS</b>
{\c&HFFFFFF&}"Un mensonge est pas
une version des faits." - Terry Hanning
Yo, je peux t'aider ?
- Je cherche du boulot.
- Ici ?
Vous avez besoin de quelqu'un ?
- T'as quel âge ?
- 18 ans.
D'accord, j'ai 15 ans.
Je peux te donner un formulaire,
mais le patron,
il prendra pas en dessous de 17 ans.
Tu traînais pas avec Namond ?
J'étais aux coins de rue de Fayette.
Je me souviens de toi.
J'en ai eu marre. C'est devenu démodé.
Tu vas devoir zoner encore,
puis revenir voir si on a quelque chose.
Pourquoi moi ?
Pourquoi pas quelqu'un d'un district
où y a eu un SDF tué ?
Il y a un hic.
C'est un truc tordu à la McNulty.
Je veux pas me faire griller
ni aucun de mes gars.
Je t'explique.
J'ai plus de ressources que nécessaire
pour mon enquête. C'est couvert.
Mais Lester a une nouvelle piste
sur Marlo Stanfield
et il lui faut des hommes.
Une nouvelle piste, hein ?
Tu veux dire une putain d'écoute.
Non, il n'y a pas d'écoute.
De qui tu te moques ?
Je lui ai filé le numéro de Stanfield
y a pas deux semaines.
Je sais rien à propos d'une écoute.
Je dis juste qu'il a une nouvelle piste
sur Marlo et il lui faut des hommes.
On lui a coupé les moyens ?
Il a refroidi tous ces gus
dans les vacantes.
Donc tu les envoies à Lester
et ils sont payés pour ton enquête ?
Avec plein d'heures sup'.
Et la paperasse ?
Les comptes-rendus, rapports de service,
je m'en charge.
Tes gars n'ont que du travail de police
à faire.
Daniels m'a donné la liberté
de choisir qui je veux.
Envoie-moi de bons éléments.
McNulty.
Et les voitures ?
Compte administratif
dans une entreprise.
Prends ce qu'il te faut.
Entretien des véhicules des travaux
publics retardé de trois mois,
déneigement réduit de moitié
et on prie
pour le réchauffement climatique :
on évite une grosse coupe
du budget de l'école ce trimestre.
Ceci finance entièrement
les opérations de police, exact ?
- De retour à la situation d'avant.
- C'est le bon moment.
Licenciement des profs évité
et hausse de 15 points au test des CE2.
C'est acceptable. Mais si le crime
baisse pas sur les 6 prochains mois,
tu es vulnérable.
C'est maintenant ou jamais.
De plus, les sans-abri
apportent des bons points.
Le gouverneur était à la radio hier
et Steiner l'a étalé
pour les coupes fédérales.
La Santé pour les Sans-abri veut une
veillée devant la mairie demain soir.
- Tu as accepté ?
- Norman a dit oui
si je pouvais placer quelques mots.
- En parlant du loup.
- J'étais au téléphone avec le <i>Post</i>.
Un journaliste veut ta réaction pour
son article sur Dobey à Prince George
qui veut t'affronter
aux primaires démocrates.
Quoi ? Dobey se présente ?
Pire, Upshaw raconte
qu'il pourrait se ranger à ses côtés.
On risquerait
- un soulèvement du comté.
- Pourquoi ils feraient ça ?
Beaucoup de Noirs en ont marre, là-bas.
Beaucoup de frustration
de ne jamais atteindre son ambition.
Dobey n'a aucune chance.
Il va juste nous faire saigner
et dépenser pour rien.
À la réunion à P.G. le mois dernier,
tu es allé voir qui ?
Steny.
Maloney, Miller. Ces types.
Blanc, Blanc et Blanc.
Même pas un café
avec ce pauvre parlementaire Upshaw.
- Je le snobais pas.
- Ils en ont assez
d'être pris pour le décor.
- Merde, je dois baiser une main ?
- Plus d'une main, en fait.
- Heures sup' illimitées ?
- C'est ce qu'on m'a dit.
- Mais on travaillera pas sur les SDF ?
- Pas tout le temps.
Le Grand Banditisme a une enquête
qui demande de la surveillance.
Merde. Peu importe ce qu'on bosse.
- J'ai besoin d'argent.
- C'est d'accord.
Vous bosserez pour la Criminelle,
avec l'inspecteur McNulty.
Et aussi...
Caisses louées au parc-autos.
De la bombe.
C'est magnifique.
La vache.
C'est bien bizarre,
de parler à un tel psychopathe.
J'ai bien interrogé Dick Cheney.
À ton avis, Gus,
on en fait trop
ou Templeton ne gonfle rien ?
- C'est vrai selon la police.
- Et les photos qu'il a reçues ?
Il a disparu.
On va devoir parler des sans-abri
jusqu'à décembre.
Décembre ?
Les propositions de Pulitzer
se font à l'année civile.
Ce dont un journal s'intéresse à Noël,
il s'en tape l'année suivante.
Les sans-abri, messieurs.
Attends.
Attends. Un type dans le hall
veut parler à un rédacteur en chef.
- De quoi ?
- Qui a bossé
sur l'article du vétéran SDF.
Le papier de Scott ?
Il veut pas parler à Scott ?
Il dit que Templeton
ne prend plus ses appels,
il est donc venu
parler à quelqu'un d'autre.
Quelqu'un descend.
C'est tout ce qu'il a dit ?
S'est approché et a dit
qu'il s'est fait Savino.
Il descendra d'autres gros bras
si Marlo vient pas
l'affronter.
Heureusement il m'a pas reconnu,
pour l'appart de Monk.
Je détournais la tête en espérant
qu'il se souvienne pas de moi.
Et il boitait vachement.
Il avait une béquille.
Il mentait pas, pour Savino, si ?
Tout le monde dit
qu'Omar est en guerre.
Paraît qu'il s'est fait une planque.
- Tout le monde...
- Tout le monde doit fermer sa gueule.
Écoutez, je dis juste,
si Marlo s'est vénère contre June Bug
pour une insulte, et vous avez refroidi
June et toute sa famille,
alors putain, quoi ?
Omar le traite de pute
- tous les jours.
- Nique Omar !
Tu crois qu'on va pas l'avoir,
ce suceur de bite ?
Ce négro va se faire buter.
Vous allez le dire à Marlo ?
- On lui dit ou on lui dit pas.
- Il a assez à faire.
Le jeunot pense pas pareil.
- Je sais pas. Si j'étais Marlo...
- Fils de pute, tu l'es pas.
- Framboise ?
- Fraise des bois.
- Quoi ?
- Rien.
Faut qu'on traverse la ville.
Cette chiennasse
va t'indiquer les travaux,
va te dire d'aller à gauche, à droite.
Elle te taillera une pipe
si tu demandes gentiment. Regarde.
Yo ! T'es obligé de mettre
du vieux bon R&B.
Nouvelle caisse, heures sup'.
Ce putain de détachement, mec.
J'espère qu'on attrapera jamais
ce putain de maboul.
Officiers.
Écoutez.
Y a deux jeunes au coin de rue.
Un en t-shirt blanc, l'autre en maillot.
Le pétard dans son pantalon,
l'autre sur le pneu.
- Au coin de rue ?
- Fulton et Lex.
- OK.
- Merci, mec.
M. Hanning ?
Un honneur de vous rencontrer,
monsieur.
- Vous êtes qui ?
- Gus Haynes.
- J'ai édité l'article où vous figurez.
- Vous êtes un connard de menteur.
C'est Omar, yo !
Vaut mieux cavaler, gros.
Taillez !
Un,
deux,
trois,
quatre.
Vous voyez ?
Omar sait laquelle c'est.
On dirait que tous vos gros bras
ont fermé boutique et sont indisposés.
Autant me les balancer,
vous me suivez ?
Je vais allumer et entrer.
Vous bossez un coin de rue à Stanfield.
Donc vous bossez
pour une vraie baltringue.
Vous suivez ?
Je viens dans ces rues tous les jours.
Tout seul.
Et où qu'il est ? Hein ?
Yo, faites-lui passer le mot.
Marlo Stanfield
n'est pas digne de cette ville !
Pigé ?
8 hommes, 4 voitures.
Ellis les a briefés.
Ils savent ce qu'il en est.
Ils sont contents des heures sup'.
T'en fais pas, Lester.
Signe juste le putain de papier
et ferme ta gueule.
Donne.
Prêt ? Car va falloir
une heure de plus sur le périph'
de la capitale à cette heure-ci.
- T'as déjà fait un profil du FBI ?
- Une fois.
C'était comment ?
Ils prennent ton dossier, te relisent
des choses que tu sais déjà.
- Alors, à quoi bon le faire ?
- Pour dire qu'on l'a fait.
Un paquet de Newport.
Des légères.
Et aussi ça.
Lowenthal, il est où, putain ?
Il est...
Et voilà, Bunk.
Demande de comparaison d'ADN.
Affaire 06H271. Des traces latentes
aux échantillons prélevés.
Ça fait partie de l'enquête
sur le tueur en série,
désormais.
C'est différent. Si c'est lié...
Ça l'est. Ça l'est.
- C'est dans mes notes.
- J'ai jamais parlé de mitraillage.
- Désolé, mais si.
- J'avais dit
que notre véhicule de tête
a été touché par un EEI surélevé,
tuant l'artilleur et explosant
les mains du conducteur. C'est tout.
Ça suffisait.
- Pourquoi avoir inventé le reste ?
- Je n'ai rien inventé.
- On buvait du café.
- Du café ?
Avec des donuts. Vous avez dit...
- Quoi ?
- Puis-je finir ?
J'en sais rien. On me parle
de café et donuts, mais pas de...
Puis-je finir ? Si vous me laissez pas
raconter ma version des faits...
Un mensonge est pas
une version des faits.
- J'ai pas à écouter ça.
- Scott, on se détend.
Prenez un peu de recul,
s'il vous plaît.
M. Hanning, pardonnez-moi,
mais buvez-vous beaucoup ?
Vous me voyez dormir
sous un pont sobre ?
Parfois, quand j'ai bu un peu,
et j'aime bien boire,
mes récits ont tendance à être
un peu plus descriptifs. En fait...
Je sais ce que c'est.
J'ai raconté des histoires à foison.
Mais il y a certaines choses,
faut jamais merder avec.
Je vous crois, M. Hanning.
Je crois que vous y croyiez.
Que vous croyiez m'avoir dit une chose.
Mais, monsieur,
avec tout le respect
pour votre service rendu au pays,
vous ne m'avez pas dit ça,
mais autre chose.
J'ai écrit ce que M. Hanning m'a dit.
- Vous avez sûrement...
- Et si un des gars de la marine
qui y était lit cette merde
que vous avez inventée ?
C'est pourquoi je suis venu.
Et si un des gars voyait ça ?
Qu'il disparaisse de ma vue.
Il est pas bien.
Il a pas pris ses médocs ou que sais-je,
mais il est pas bien.
- Beaucoup le sont, malheureusement...
- Oui, il fait bonne figure.
On va se renseigner
sur son état de service,
contacter des personnes de son unité,
découvrir ce qui s'est passé ce jour-là,
près de Fallujah, c'est ça ?
Si c'est comme tu l'as dit, on laisse.
Sinon, on le classera en malentendu.
Mais quoi qu'il en soit,
on écrira un rectificatif
si l'article n'était pas exact.
Et merde.
Et on n'avait pas pris de café.
Mais du chocolat au lait.
Mais ça te manque, ce que tu avais ?
Je suis encore trop sauvage
pour être posée.
C'était pas Cheryl, mais ma faute.
Le truc, c'est que j'ai trouvé un lien
avec le petit.
Je le ressens bien.
C'est super, les gosses.
Et toi et Beadie ?
Tu es resté sage un moment.
Bunk m'avait dit
je suis pas une bonne influence.
Tout le monde autour de moi.
- Il était bourré ?
- Oui, mais quand même.
- Omar est mort. Je te le dis.
- Déjà entendu avant.
- Pour de vrai.
- Tu l'as vu ?
Il est couché à l'intérieur.
Un gars du coin dit qu'il volait
les Coréens et s'est fait tuer.
T'aurais dû me laisser l'emprisonner.
Ç'aurait été mieux pour lui.
Merci de l'appel.
Je me disais que tu voulais voir ça,
tu le connaissais bien.
- Travail de pro.
- Non. Je pensais ça aussi,
mais la Coréenne
qu'on a emmenée en centrale
a dit que c'était un petit bonhomme
avec un gros flingue.
Il est entré et l'a dégommé.
Petit comment ?
Il l'a plumé ?
La vendeuse a dit que les fourmis
sont passés après pour les souvenirs.
Ils ont pris son fusil et son semi-auto.
Ils lui ont fait les poches.
Je t'en prie.
De retour à la traque, hein ?
Le jeunot dit qu'il est par là,
sans voiture et marche en boitant.
Il tombera, Chris. Tu verras.
- Marlo veut qu'on se voie.
- Sérieux ?
Où on est ?
Encore en préparation.
Pourquoi, t'en as une nouvelle ?
<i>6 heures 55 minutes et 34 secondes.</i>
On est sur personne,
on reprendra dans la matinée.
<i>OK. À plus.</i>
Bon. Doze, Truck,
vous êtes sur Monk Metcalf.
Bobby,
toi et Brian êtes sur Chris Partlow.
Il est souvent avec Snoop Pearson,
mais s'ils se séparent,
Karen et Tony la suivront.
Marcus, Angela,
vous êtes de réserve en cas de besoin.
Tu te charges de Stanfield ?
Ils parlent affaires face à face
en extérieur plusieurs fois par jour.
On cherche juste à trouver
les similitudes des rencontres.
On les trouve où ?
Stanfield a tous les coins de rue
de Martin Luther King à Monroe,
et ils commencent vers 11 heures.
C'est à ce moment qu'ils demandent
des réappros et que Monk passe.
Souvent le matin, Marlo débute
par une ou deux discussions
sur l'aire de jeu
entre Mosher et Lanvale.
Ils vendent aussi en gros, semble-t-il.
Les autres dealers ou n'importe qui
voulant le voir
le rencontrent là-bas. Chris et Snoop
sont généralement avec lui.
McNulty s'est chargé de votre paperasse.
Ce qu'on fait là
n'a rien de crucial pour le tribunal,
alors allez-y pépère. Entendu ?
On s'organise ici demain à 9 heures.
Pas signe de lui. Mais tant qu'on l'a
pas, je fais rien d'autre.
Vous êtes pas au courant ?
Omar est dans un sac.
Je croyais vous alliez me le dire.
Monk vient de me l'apprendre.
- Qui l'a eu ?
- Un petit.
- Qui ?
- Pas entendu de nom.
Je sais même pas si y avait une raison.
La fourmi voulait entendre bang,
voir les dégâts.
Ouais... Fini, cette merde.
Après le prochain ravitaillement,
on s'éclatera à Atlantic City, hein ?
Sur le plan médicolégal,
ce type est très varié.
Sexuel jusqu'à un certain point,
mais inhibé.
Nocturne sur certains,
diurne pour d'autres.
Et ce ciblage des sans-abri,
pour commencer ?
Nous n'avons vu ça qu'à quelques
reprises, mais dans ces cas,
ce fut quelqu'un de cette cohorte.
D'ordinaire, ils n'ont pas de portable
et n'appellent pas les journaux.
Bien étrange, votre individu.
Inspecteurs.
Restez assis. Arthur Toland,
directeur adjoint de cette unité.
Je voulais juste m'assurer
que nous faisions avancer votre enquête.
Très bien. Merci.
Vous devez le reconnaître
de la télévision. Il est passé partout.
Ces nouvelles émissions...
Toujours besoin d'un expert
quand une affaire émerge.
Greta Van Susteren,
Nancy Grace, Chris Matthews.
Ce type au front énorme...
Comment il s'appelle ?
- Larry King ?
- Oui.
Et puis c'est une occasion
de faire parler du Bureau.
Et je vends des livres.
<i>Chasseurs d'hommes : la montée
du tueur en série américain</i> ?
Ils se sont beaucoup inspirés de moi
pour <i>Les Experts</i>.
Ils m'ont consulté.
Vous n'avez pas entendu parler...
Vous enquêtez depuis longtemps ?
Huit ans.
Les tueurs en série,
on en voit pas tellement.
Meurtres liés à la drogue.
Vol dans la rue de temps à autre.
Environ 300 par an.
Maintenant, vous avez un tueur en série,
donc je vous laisse.
Bonne chasse.
Art était l'enquêteur principal
sur Unabomber.
C'était y a 16 ans, non ?
Et son frère l'avait balancé ?
<i>Beaucoup sont plongés des heures
dans l'obscurité et la confusion</i>
4 feuillets sur les sans-abri.
C'est du bon, ça.
Vraiment.
L'atmosphère est bien rendue,
surtout sous le pont Hanover
quand la police est venue
donner un avertissement.
La tragédie dans les courts instants.
- En vérité, j'avais un guide.
- Oui ?
Un type que j'ai rencontré
à la soupe populaire.
Il y est bénévole. Ancien accro.
Ce gars a un truc. Il est...
Je sais pas. Plus il parlait, plus je
sentais que je voulais écrire sur lui.
Mais il est pas sans-abri.
Et j'ai pas le déclic.
Merde, je ne vois pas l'histoire.
- Il a un nom ?
- Reginald Cousins.
Bénévole. Il gagne sa vie comment ?
Il vend le <i>Baltimore Sun</i>
chaque matin à Light Street.
- Pas vraiment un secteur croissant.
- Il vit dans la cave de sa soeur.
Elle lui descend une assiette,
mais le laisse pas monter.
- Passe du temps avec lui.
- Et le tour des quartiers ?
- La couverture des SDF.
- T'es couvert.
Prends deux semaines et observe.
D'accord ?
Dernières infos des flics. 2 morts
dans un incendie, comté de Charles,
- et un homicide en ville.
- Ettlin, on a de la place ?
Il manque une brève en faits divers.
Quatre paragraphes.
C'est quoi, l'homicide ?
Un Noir de 34 ans tué
dans une épicerie de Baltimore Ouest.
Le suspect mineur est recherché.
Écris sur l'incendie.
Raye le meurtre, on n'a pas de place.
Notre conclusion
de l'analyse comportementale
selon les faits connus est la suivante.
Le suspect est vraisemblablement
un homme blanc de 30 à 40 ans.
Vraisemblablement non diplômé,
mais se sent néanmoins supérieur
à ceux ayant fait plus d'études.
Il travaille vraisemblablement
dans une entité bureaucratique,
fonction publique, peut-être,
ou quasi-fonction publique,
où il se sent exclu.
Il a un problème avec l'autorité
et une profonde rancoeur
envers ceux qui auraient entravé
son avancée professionnelle.
Les actes sexuels mineurs
suggèrent que ce n'est pas
le motif principal des meurtres.
En fait, l'absence d'ADN de salive
sur la morsure de la dernière victime
nous indique une possible
mise en scène post-mortem.
Il a des difficultés
dans les relations durables
et pourrait être
un alcoolique fonctionnel,
l'alcool étant un déclencheur
dans la commission de ces crimes.
Son aversion des sans-abri
proviendrait d'une relation
avec quelqu'un de cette cohorte,
ou la victimisation des vagabonds
serait simplement une opportunité
d'affirmer sa supériorité
et sa prouesse intellectuelle.
Si vous avez du nouveau,
faxez et nous mettrons le profil à jour.
- Merci pour tout.
- Merci.
Alors, t'en penses quoi ?
Ils sont dans le bon registre.
M. le parlementaire, je ferai
le maximum pour qu'on s'entende bien,
mais Dobey aux primaires
ne fera de bien à personne.
- À vous.
- Je suis le seul candidat viable
pour battre ce rép,
et vous le savez. Au final,
n'est-ce pas ce dont il s'agit ?
Ne perdez pas votre salive
à me dire ce que je sais déjà
sur notre gouverneur avide, réducteur
d'impôts, refourguant tout aux comtés.
Le comté du P.G. a 100 meurtres par an,
un système scolaire plus que bancal
et un trafic aux heures de pointe
pire qu'Atlanta.
L'homme d'Annapolis ne pisserait
même pas sur nous si on brûlait.
Ne vous retenez pas.
Ras-le-bol de ces foutus républicains.
J'aurais dû venir plus tôt.
Mais entre les votes de Baltimore,
Montgomery et votre comté,
je deviendrai gouverneur.
Et vous n'aurez plus cette frustration.
Je sais que d'autres enfoirés
vous ont déjà dit ça,
- mais je vous donne ma parole.
- Vous avez raison.
On me l'a déjà dit.
Pour garder le comté du P.G.
dans votre camp,
ça coûtera bien plus que votre parole.
<i>Un seul futur possible.</i>
<i>De retour demain ou le jour suivant.
Ou pas. Réfléchis.</i>
T'as appelé ?
Drôle d'affaire que tu as là.
Ta victime avait une adresse.
Une maison, loyer payé.
Voire un emprunt immobilier.
Mais pas SDF, en aucun cas.
Pas de strangulation ni de ruban rouge.
Christopher Partlow.
Un homme moindre s'énerverait,
car t'as dépassé les bornes, Bunk.
Mais moi ?
Je me souviens du nom de Partlow
de l'année dernière.
Bravo.
Mais...
te fous plus de ma gueule.
Il a menti sur sa demande
d'emprunt immobilier ?
- On a un nom pour ça, ici.
- Oui, le coup de grâce. Je sais.
Pour ça, il passera un marché.
Pas le genre de Billy.
Alors, il risque un bon nombre d'années.
Un jury fédéral, c'est très différent
- de ce qu'il y a à Calvert Street.
- J'ai essayé de leur dire.
Mais M. Bond a voulu plaider ça
en personne,
voir s'il ne pouvait pas
s'ouvrir le chemin de la mairie.
Vous avez le coup de grâce, inspecteur,
mais pas de revolver pour le tirer.
- On ne peut le prendre.
- Tout est sur papier.
Vous aviez des chèques payés.
Des comptes bancaires.
Vous aviez son porteur à la barre.
Mais nous avions un jury local.
Nous récoltions des informations
sur Clay Davis depuis six ans,
inspecteur. Six ans
que nous avons un dossier ouvert
contre cet extorqueur.
Maintenant que les enfoirés locaux que
vous êtes avez en une seule semaine
transformé ce putain de Clay Davis
en Martin Luther King Jr,
vous venez me voir avec ça ?
Que vous aviez dans votre poche
tout du long ?
À la recherche du jury fédéral d'une
majorité de Blancs comme remède.
Eh bien,
je regrette, inspecteur.
Merci.
C'est quoi ?
De la poche d'un brakos mort.
Omar Little.
Omar ? Mort ?
Oui. Tu lis plus les dépêches ?
Tué hier dans une épicerie.
Long à la détente il a été.
Sans déconner.
Une derrière la tête.
Norris et Crutchfield sont dessus.
Ils recherchent un mineur.
Il traquait Stanfield et sa bande.
- Et c'était sur lui ?
- Ouais.
Pensé à toi et Lester quand j'ai vu ça.
Pour te remercier
de m'avoir obtenu une super analyse.
ADN positif pour Chris Partlow.
Un tabassage dans une allée,
pas un de ceux des vacantes.
Enculé. T'as tout un tas de nouvelles
aujourd'hui, hein ?
Je m'en vais chercher un mandat.
Tu peux attendre avant de le délivrer ?
- On y est presque, Bunk.
- Combien de temps ?
Car c'est des poursuites pour meurtre
honnêtes, là.
J'en parlerai à Lester.
Bravo.
Pas d'artifice. Que du bon vieux travail
de police. T'en dis quoi, Jimmy ?
Sans mon histoire,
t'attendrais encore ton analyse.
Écoute, Jimmy. Le meurtre de Conaway,
à Westport ? Le travesti ?
Je consulte Vi-CAP.
Il y en a un autre. Regarde.
En Caroline, il y a quatre mois.
Pour une voiture et 2 nuits d'hôtel,
je peux conclure.
Tu racontes quoi ? Toi, c'était un 9 mm.
Celui-ci, c'est un .32.
Toi, rencontre dans un bar.
Ici, effraction.
Ça vaut le coup.
Je vois pas. Désolé.
Tu vas me faire cracher
le morceau, hein ?
T'as déjà joué à Hilton Head ?
Mon beau-frère m'a appelé.
Il a dégoté une partie de golf
pour ce week-end.
Jimmy, j'y vais, bordel.
Rien à foutre. Vas-y.
Tu sais, c'est bien mignon,
ton petit trafic, là.
Distribuer l'argent du détachement
comme un prêtre donnant l'hostie.
Je sais pas exactement
ce que tu mijotes mais je sais ceci :
si quelqu'un passait un coup de fil,
ton trafic est sérieusement niqué.
Deux nuits et une voiture.
Leander, j'ai 10 h 55 min et 34 s
depuis le tél de Marlo.
Ça bouge ?
Je l'ai. Il vient de l'est
sur Baltimore Street à Calhoun.
Qui est sur Monk ?
Attends.
23-06 à 23-11. T'es où, mec ?
23-11. Direction sud
sur Martin Luther King,
on approche de la nationale 40.
<i>C'est le RDV.</i>
<i>Monk et Marlo côté ouest. On est dessus.</i>
À l'angle d'Argyle et Dolphin.
Monk et Marlo, comme prévu.
Maintenant, j'ai 4 h 40 min et 35 s
transmis au tél de Marlo.
Oui, il mate ça, Lester.
<i>On sait que c'est pas un appel de Monk.</i>
23-06 à 23-12.
- 23-12.
- <i>Vous surveillez qui ?</i>
- Mes individus.
- <i>Touchent leur tél ?</i>
Négatif.
- <i>Ils bougent ?</i>
- Négatif.
- <i>23-14. Aucun mouvement non plus.</i>
- Aucun appel ni mouvement.
Il y a donc quelqu'un d'autre dans
ce réseau qu'on connaît pas encore.
Purée.
Laisse-moi t'aider.
OK, t'es prêt ?
J'ai pas d'argent, là,
mais je vais chez le ferrailleur
dans une heure ou deux.
Tu me files un coup de main,
je te filerai 10.
T'as un torchon derrière toi.
{\a3}Ferraille !
{\a3}Le ferrailleur !
Tu vas où, là ?
Je dois voir Lester pour...
C'est quoi ?
Les délinquants sexuels en conditionnel
sur cinq codes postaux.
J'ai aussi des infos sur ceux qu'on a
cueillis à la jetée 5 avec un portable.
- Tu vas vraiment...
- Comparer le profil du FBI
avec toute personne d'intérêt
que je trouve ?
Bé oui. Faut bien le faire.
- Tu fous quoi ?
- Viens voir.
Maurice Dobey ?
Comme gouverneur ? De mon État ?
Putaiiiiiiiiin.
C'est de la politique politicienne.
Faire semblant de présenter un perdant
pour pousser les gens à s'acquitter.
Dobey peut vous salir
à Baltimore comme à P.G..
À jouer la carte communautaire.
- Déplorable.
- Que veut Upshaw
pour s'éclipser ?
- Trop.
- Vous payerez ?
Disons que je suis en pourparlers.
Je ferai tout
pour que cette insurrection
- se répande pas.
- Merveilleux.
Et combien le soutien fidèle
de la coalition démocratique de l'Est
va me coûter ?
Un simple soutien.
Vu que cet homme est toujours debout,
je vois mal Rupert Bond atterrir
ici. Pas vous ?
Et pour mon soutien, vous rendrez
la pareille en ignorant nos amis
à Prince George ?
Et la loyauté de l'Ouest
me coûtera quoi exactement ?
Pas beaucoup.
- 3 sièges à la commission d'alcool...
- Un siège.
Deux, et je récolterai des fonds
pour vous dans les primaires.
Vendu. Et Clay, j'ai peur des dégâts
que vous pouvez faire avec 2 sièges.
Ça se fait pas.
Non... Mais c'est comme ça.
- Non, tu peux pas faire ça.
- On est en train.
Ce qu'ils donnent pour l'histoire,
je l'envoie à Lester.
Ou Crutchfield, ou Norris.
Quiconque a une affaire à résoudre.
Déjà que t'as gâché ta journée, hier,
à Quantico,
je supporte pas de te voir continuer.
Tu devrais rebosser ton effraction.
- Jimmy, tu n'as pas le droit.
- Encore deux jours.
Lester met le paquet sur Marlo.
Après, on entendra plus parler du tueur.
Les chefs se désintéresseront, je ferai
semblant d'être à court de ressources.
Et ça retournera dans le bureau
administratif. Aucun mal de fait.
Tout ce que tu veux, Kima...
pour bosser ton triple, ou toute autre
affaire qui t'est importante.
Effectifs, heures sup',
analyses, voitures...
Suffit de me demander.
Je dois y aller.
Debout !
Vieux papiers !
Tôles !
Ferraille ! Le ferrailleur !
Bug. Là-haut.
Attends, mon garçon.
Je te donnerai les 10 demain.
Et si tu cherches du boulot,
j'ai à soulever.
Tu connais le ferrailleur
sur Booth Street ? Sois-y avant 9 h.
La vache, Dukie.
Vendeur itinérant maintenant ?
J'ai 5 heures 15 minutes et 34 secondes.
Je suis à Park Heights,
mais je l'ai perdu juste après le parc.
Un bus a accroché le trottoir
et a renversé un poteau.
Le temps de revenir, il avait filé.
À plus.
Grosse nouvelle.
Bunk a un mandat pour meurtre
sur Chris Partlow.
- C'est pas vrai.
- Pas un des vacantes.
ADN sur un tabassage dans une allée.
S'il s'en sert maintenant,
ces types vont se terrer.
On y est presque.
Il nous donne deux jours.
Il m'est redevable.
J'ai accéléré son analyse.
Et Omar Little ? Le brakos ?
- Oui ?
- Pris une balle,
une épicerie à l'Ouest.
Bunk a sorti ça de sa poche.
- Ça peut nous servir ?
- Il chassait la bande à Marlo.
Cheese.
Cheese Wagstaff ?
En plus de leurs coins de rue, ces types
vendent en gros dans toute la ville.
J'ai pensé que Cheese
était qu'un parmi d'autres.
Le papier sous-entend
qu'Omar le mettait avec Marlo.
Un bras droit au moins.
Bref, je dois y aller, faire davantage
semblant pour le reste de la ville.
Au fait, je l'ai dit à Greggs.
McNulty...
Encore combien de personnes ?
Elle allait sauter
les deux pieds joints.
Je supportais pas
de la fourvoyer comme ça.
Comment elle l'a pris ?
23-06 à tout code 23.
J'essaie de retrouver mon individu.
- <i>Personne au nord-ouest pour m'aider ?</i>
- 23-15 à 23-06. Je suis
au 2800, Edgecombe Circle South,
je surveille l'individu femelle.
C'est peut-être le rendez-vous.
Edgecombe Circle... C'est où, ça ?
- <i>Perpendiculaire à Pall Mall.</i>
- C'est où, Pall Mall ?
- Je maîtrise pas trop le nord-ouest.
- <i>Entre Pimlico...</i>
Laisse, j'ai un plan de la ville.
Voyons ce qu'on a là.
Plan 34,
grille E3.
34, E3.
- <i>T'as quoi ?</i>
- La dernière horloge montrait quoi ?
Et ces personnes
avec qui je partage la scène ce soir
représentent les centaines...
non, les milliers de citoyens sans abri,
sans protection,
dans cette ville ce soir.
Ce n'est pas une fatalité !
Assurément, les sept dernières années
n'ont pas apporté les mêmes niveaux
d'engagement fédéral
envers les villes américaines
que ceux d'administrations précédentes.
Et assurément, notre gouverneur
a, l'année dernière, imposé
de sévères restrictions
aux programmes provisoires de l'État
qui étaient en place.
Et le peu qui restait de notre prétendu
filet de protection a été déchiqueté,
et de plus en plus de nos concitoyens
se sont retrouvés à vivre en marchant
sur le fil du rasoir, dans la rue.
Eh bien, ce n'est pas seulement
tragique, c'est impardonnable !
Je suis ici pour dire que ces personnes
avec qui je partage la scène
ne peuvent plus être invisibles,
tout comme ceux qui sont sans abri
dans cette ville, dans ce pays,
ne peuvent plus nous être invisibles.
Il est regrettable
qu'il ait fallu attendre
les actes d'un impitoyable prédateur
pour nous faire réveiller. Mais nous,
à Baltimore, avons été mis à l'épreuve
et on nous a appris
que tous nos citoyens
méritent la protection absolue de la loi
et le soutien absolu de la communauté.
Nous disons à ce tueur fou
et à tous les autres maux
qui s'attaquent à ceux sans abri
dans notre ville :
vous ne pourrez les attaquer ce soir.
Ni demain.
Ni plus jamais !
Nous vous protégerons !
Merci.
{\pos(252,182)}<i>Veillée aux bougies à la mairie</i>
Elle vous a demandé
de remuer son verre.
Vous étiez sur mon truc, pas vrai ?
Je vous dois un verre.
Quel est votre poison ?
Je ne prends rien, sénateur,
merci beaucoup.
"Obonda" ?
Elle était pas mal.
Vous savez, c'était principalement
mes preuves que vous avez coulées.
Vous pourriez refaire ça ?
Pardon ?
Sauf que cette fois-ci,
c'est un jury fédéral.
Disons neuf Blancs, trois Noirs.
Temps pour vous de mettre les bouts,
inspecteur.
Documents bancaires
de votre demande d'emprunt
pour le bien dans le comté de Calvert
il y a quelques années.
Donnez donc ça à Billy Murphy.
Demandez à votre avocat
quels sont vos risques.
Cela reste entre nous deux,
sénateur.
Personne d'autre si je l'ai pas décidé.
Quoi ?
Vous cherchez à me vendre un dossier ?
- Enculé, si tu f...
- Je ne veux pas être payé ainsi.
Mais quand, dans 2 jours, vous aurez
des réponses à mes questions, monsieur.
Ou mon prochain appel sera
au cabinet du procureur fédéral,
et nous remettrons ça,
mais pour de vrai.
Gardez la copie.
Madame.
Je te préviens,
avant que le feu d'artifice commence,
je supprime son accroche franco.
- Mais tu me soutiens ?
- Du mieux que je peux.
Je supprime ton accroche.
Je ne publierai pas d'article
sur un rassemblement public,
une veillée aux bougies à la mairie,
à vrai dire,
où l'anecdote accrocheuse et la citation
viennent d'une sans-abri anonyme.
Elle ne veut pas qu'on sache
qu'elle est sans-abri. Je l'ai expliqué.
Scott, il y avait
des centaines de sans-abri ce soir,
des gens qui ont fait le choix de venir.
Je parie qu'un bon nombre
t'aurait laissé publier leur nom.
Mais son histoire est super.
Regarde cette citation.
Citation parfaite.
Je ne pourrais demander mieux.
Et c'est ça qui me préoccupe.
Va te faire voir
si tu crois que j'ai inventé.
On a une norme ici que l'on suit.
Je vais la suivre.
C'est parti, Gus.
Ouais.
Vous retouchez l'article de Scott ?
- Oui.
- Mais je pensais...
Attribution anonyme
dans un cadre public ? C'est inutile.
Parlons-en.
J'en ai parlé avec le rédacteur en chef
de Métro, et il est d'accord.
L'article est
au secrétariat de rédaction,
et en tant que secrétaire de rédaction,
j'ai fait mon boulot.
En tant que directeur de la rédaction,
si vous voulez autre chose,
révisez l'article.
Mais nous avons une politique
sur les sources ici,
et je ne veux pas
faire une entorse au règlement.
Bonne nuit.
<i>McNulty, c'est Christeson.</i>
<i>J'ai résolu mon affaire.</i>
Je voulais te remercier.
J'aurais pas réussi autrement.
Pas de problème.
Ça s'est très bien passé.
- Les enfants dorment ?
- Ils t'ont vu
sur WBAL.
Anna a trouvé ta coupe drôle.
Du moment qu'elle a été impressionnée.
CNN était là. Je me demande s'ils vont
diffuser un reportage ce soir.
- Bonne journée pour M'sieur le Maire ?
- Je sais pas.
Nerese a soutiré mon soutien
pour être maire,
et Clay Davis, revenu d'entre les morts,
a pris 2 sièges
à la commission d'alcool.
Pour qu'ils se joignent pas au petit jeu
de guerre d'Upshaw à Prince George.
Tu vas soutenir Nerese ?
Tu m'as dit préférer Bond.
C'est le cas,
mais ce truc avec Upshaw...
Putain, je vais peut-être même devoir
l'augmenter pour le calmer.
Bon sang. Il demande quoi ?
Voilà. Regarde.
Upshaw demande quoi ?
Que la moitié de tout fonds périscolaire
ou anticrime
que je récupère pour Baltimore
aille au comté du P.G..
Si tu acceptes, Baltimore a moitié moins
que ce que tu veux pour les écoles.
Oui, mais si je gagne pas, Jen',
je récupère rien du tout.
Regarde.
<i>Nous disons à ce tueur fou</i>
<i>et à tous les autres maux...</i>
Allez. Direct au lit.
- Salut, mon grand.
- Salut, McNulty.
Vous êtes allés où ?
Pas vraiment tes affaires, Jimmy.
Et la prochaine fois, je vais
nulle part, tu te retrouves dehors,
car c'est ma putain de baraque.
Travail de police.
Je sors le livre ADC
pour trouver un endroit.
Je suis sur le même numéro de page
que la trotteuse.
Je me souviens qu'on avait
plein d'horloges avec 34 secondes.
Une page de Bawlmer Ouest.
Exact. La trotteuse, c'est toujours
la page du plan. Longitude, de A à K,
c'est l'heure. Et pour la latitude,
ils font par intervalles de 5 minutes.
Ils connaissent le lieu de RDV d'avance
et ils le codent
par rapport à la grille.
Mais si l'horloge
n'a rien à voir avec l'heure,
comment savent-ils
quand se rencontrer ?
Tout est à moins de 30 min en voiture.
Même avec des bouchons.
Je dirais que la logique habituelle
est qu'ils se voient
dans l'heure.
Tu sais quoi d'autre s'explique ?
Cette horloge quand personne bougeait.
Les heures sont toutes sur 35 secondes.
Et c'est la page pour Bawlmer Est.
Cheese.
Cheese Wagstaff ?
Marlo vend en gros
à l'Ouest via Monk
et à l'Est via Cheese.
Il contrôle toute la ville.
Comment on sait que c'est Cheese ?
Toi aussi, hein ?
- Vous êtes tous d'accord avec ça ?
- Kima...
Pas moi.
Tous les mecs au bar, Jimmy,
toutes les filles,
ils viennent pas à ta veillée.
Pas parce qu'ils t'aiment pas
mais parce qu'ils ont jamais su
ton nom de famille.
Un mois plus tard, quelqu'un leur dit :
"Jimmy est mort."
"Jimmy qui ?"
"Jimmy le flic."
"Oh !", ils font. "Lui."
Et tous ceux du service,
tous ceux avec qui tu as passé
des heures dans la voiture radio,
les mecs avec leurs pieds sur la table
racontant des histoires,
qui t'ont carotté sur la bouffe,
qui ont signé tes fiches d'heures sup',
au final,
eux aussi ne seront pas là.
La famille. C'est tout. Que la famille.
Et si tu as de la chance,
un ou deux amis
qui sont comme la famille.
Voilà ce qui est réservé à la majorité
d'entre nous. Tout le reste n'est que...
Il n'y a pas de tueur en série.
Y a aucun meurtre. J'ai tout fabriqué.
Ils nous mettaient au placard...
C'est difficile à expliquer.
Je sais même pas d'où vient la colère.
Je sais pas comment y mettre fin.
Ils me mettent à l'épreuve, putain...
On a pris l'argent de l'enquête bidon,
on l'a filé à Lester.
Maintenant, il a de quoi faire tomber
Marlo Stanfield.
Et maintenant que j'ai fait tout ça,
et que je me suis vu faire ça,
j'arrive même plus à...
Lester dit qu'il y est presque.
Le temps passera,
et je pourrai y mettre un terme.
Si tu finis pas en prison.
T'avais aucun droit, bordel.
- Je sais.
- Il s'agit aussi de ma vie.
Tu commences à raconter l'histoire,
tu te prends pour le héros.
Et puis quand t'as fini de parler, tu...
- And, uh, as you can see
from the locations,
the killer is working
primarily in the southern,
central and southeastern,
which makes sense
given the concentrations
of homeless in those districts.
Vics one and three
were killed at night,
two and four
had daylight T.O.D.s.
- Detective, what about
the missing man, Mr. Butler?
Is there any lead at all
on his whereabouts?
- No, sir. We, uh--
We have teletypes with every
police agency in the mid-Atlantic,
we're also running
daily morgue checks
in ten states
and the district,
but uh-- nothing yet.
- Where are we on a profile?
- I've arranged for our people
to travel to Quantico today.
The bureau's been
very accommodating.
- I mean,
this is a strange one.
I've heard of people
going after street people,
but it's usually
adolescent sadism.
This sexual thing--
It is different.
We put it out on VICAP,
and we have no hits anywhere
else in the country.
- I mean, I'm all for a little
kinky shit now and then,
but chewing on a homeless fella?
- You seem to be well grounded
in the case file, detective.
What else do you need?
- Well, we've developed a rough
list of those adult males
who were briefly detained
by police near pier five
soon after the suspect
made his last call.
We'd like to put some of those
under surveillance.
They're not suspects,
but we wld consider them
persons of interest.
We've also developed
a rough list
of known adult white homosexual sex
offenders in these three districts.
And, as we cull that list,
we would--
We'd like to put some of those
under surveillance, too.
About a dozen men.
Less, actually.
We should be able to eliminate
many of our potentials
through retroactive
investigation.
Do you have your people?
- I've asked the chief of patrol
to detail sergeant Ellis Carver
from the western homicide
for purposes of running
the surveillance element.
- Why not a man
from one of the districts
where the attacks occurred?
- Well, I've worked with Carver
on prolonged investigations
in the past,
and his familiary with
surveillance tactics is relevant.
Also, I would be inclined to
trust his objective assessment
when choosing surveillance teams.
Very good.
If that works for patrol,
it works for operations.
- What are we doing
to protect people?
- Patrol and tactical
are running extra cars
in all three districts
with special emphasis on posts
where the homeless congregate.
We have ten undercovers,
dressed as vagrants,
working staggered shifts.
- We're going to need
good undercover cars as well.
And I'm told that motor pool
expects nothing back
from Dickman Street until--
- Whatever you need, detective.
- Yes, Mr. Mayor, but we're
being told by public works--
- Go to Avis
if you have to, Hertz.
I don't give a shit.
People are disappearing.
They're dying, for crissake.
Just do what you need to do.
The bad news, gentlemen,
is we're actually going to have
to catch this motherfucker.
The good news is that our mayor
finally needs a police department
more than he needs
a school system.
Yo, can I help you?
I'm looking to work.
Here?
Yeah, you need anyone?
How old are you?
Eighteen.
A-ight, man, I'm fifteen.
- I mean, yo, I can give you
a form to fill out,
but the manager, he ain't gonna
hire no one under seventeen.
Hey, yo.
You used to run
with the boy Namond, right?
Yeah, I used to be
on them Fayette corners.
- Oh yeah, man, I remember you.
- Yeah, I just got tired,
ya know?
Shit got old.
So, I guess you need to bang
a while longer,
then come back,
see if we got something.
Then come back,
see if we got something.
Why me?
Why not somebody from a district
where they caught
one of your homeless cases?
Well, there's a hitch.
- This is some
fucked-up McNulty shit.
I don't want
to get burned here.
And I don't want any
of my guys getting burned.
Look, here's the deal.
Command is throwing
more resources at me
than I can use
on my homeless stuff.
I got that covered.
But Lester-- he's got
a fresh line on Marlo Stanfield,
and he needs people
to run it down.
A fresh line, huh?
He's got a fuckin' wire up
is what you mean.
- No, no, there's no--
There's no wire--
- Who the fuck are you kidding?
I handed him a fresh cell number
for Stanfield not two weeks ago.
- Listen, I don't know
anything about any wire.
I'm just saying he's got
a new line on Marlo,
and he needs people
to run it down.
Bosses stiff-armed him?
Jesus.
Guy drops all those
motherfuckers in the vacants.
Yeah.
- So you're throwing
people over to Lester,
and paying for it
from your case, is that it?
O.T. out the ass.
- What about the paperwork?
I'll take care of that.
All the run sheets,
office reports,
they come through me.
All your people got to do
is straight police work.
Daniels gave me a free hand
to pull people
from any district.
Just make sure you send me
people who work.
McNulty.
What about cars?
- Departmental account
at enterprise downtown.
Get what ya need.
- We delay fleet maintenance
for public works
over the next three months.
We cut snow removal in half
and pray for global warming.
That's enough to avoid
any ugly cuts in school funding,
at least for this quarter.
- And this funds police
operations fully, correct?
- They're back
to where they started
before we bled them out.
It's time anyway.
We ducked the teacher layoffs,
and you got the fifteen points
on the third-grade M.S.A.S.
You can live with that.
But if we don't drop
the crime in this quarter,
and the next,
you are vulnerable.
It's now or never.
- Besides, you're getting
traction in this homeless thing.
Governor was on Y.P.R.
yesterday,
and Steiner laid him out
for the state cutbacks.
- Health care for the homeless
have asked for city hall's
steps tomorrow night.
Candlelight vigil.
You said yes, right?
- Norman told 'em
they could do it
if I got a chance to say
a few choice words, yeah.
Speak of the devil.
- I just got off the phone
with the "Post."
Reporter there wants your comment
on a story he's workin
about dobey, down in P.G.,
looking to take you on
in the democratic primary.
What?
Dobey's getting in?
- Make matters worse,
Upshaw's telling people
he might just throw in
with said county exec.
Shit, we might have a full-blown
P.G. insurrection on our hands.
- Why the fuck would they do that?
- Lots of pissed off
black folks down there.
Lot of grumblin' about always
a bridesmaid, never the bride.
- No way can Dobey
take the statehouse.
All he's gonna do
is bloody us up
and make uspend money
we're gonna need in the general.
- When we went a-calling
in P.G. last month,
who'd you see?
Steny.
Maloney, Miller, those guys.
White, white and white.
Not even a cup of coffee with
poor old congressman Upshaw.
- I wasn't snubbing the guy.
- Folks down there are tired
of being taken for granted.
- Fuck, I gotta kiss a ring,
don't I?
- More than a ring, actually.
Unlimited O.T.
That's what I'm told.
- But you're sayin' we might not
be working the homeless cases.
Not all the time.
Major crimes
has a drug investigation
that may also need
surveillance work.
- Shit, who cares
what we work?
I need the money.
A-ight then.
You'll be working
out of homicide.
Report down there
to detective McNulty.
Oh yeah--
Rented wheels on the backlot.
Fuckin' a.
- Ah, man,
this is beautiful.
Oh, hell yeah.
- It's weird shit,
I gotta say.
Talkin' to a psychopath
like that.
- I interviewed
Dick Cheney once.
Whaddaya you think, gus?
Are we hyping this thing,
or is templeton
writing as it lays?
Police say it's real.
- An' those photographs
he got sent?
Hey, the guy's fucking missing.
- So I guess now we're writing
homeless stories till december, huh?
Uh-huh.
Why till December?
- Pulitzer submissions
run the calendar year.
Anything a newspaper
cares about at christmas,
they give a fuck
about by new year's.
Homelessness it is there,
gents.
Hold on--
Hold on--
Fella down the lobby says
he wants to talk to an editor.
What kind of editor?
- The kind that worked on the
story about that homeless vet.
Scott's piece?
Sure they don't want
to talk to Scott?
- Says Templeton won't
take his calls anymore,
so he walked over here
to talk to somebody else.
Tell him
someone's coming down.
That all he say?
- Just walked up
and said he got Savino.
Said he gonna get
more of our muscle
if Marlo don't come
to the street and step to him.
Good thing he didn't make me
from Monk's apartment though.
I kept on lookin' away
from the motherfucker,
hopin' he ain't remember me--
He was limpin' bad, too.
He had a crutch.
Wasn't lyin' about
Savino, was he?
Everybody sayin'
Omar's on this warpath.
Heard he got a stash house
last week.
Everybody's--
- Everybody need to
shut the fuck up.
Look, I'm just sayin',
if Marlo was all that over
June bug callin' him a name,
so that y'all dropped June
and his whole family,
then what the fuck?
Omar out here callin' bitches
every damn day.
Fuck Omar.
- What? What ya think we ain't
gonna catch this dicksucker?
This nigga gonna get got.
Y'all gonna tell Marlo?
- We tell him,
we don't tell him.
- Man got enough on his plate.
- Young'n's on some different
opinion shit there.
- I dunno. If I was Marlo--
Motherfucker, you ain't.
Raspberry?
Wild strawberry.
What?
Nothing, man.
- C'mon, man.
We gotta get across town.
- This bitch is gonna tell you
where there's construction.
It's gonna tell you left,
gonna tell you right.
Pretty much blow you
if you ask nice.
And look--
- Yo, you gotta play some old
school R&B shit on that, man.
- New car, O.T.
this fuckin' detail, man.
I hope we never catch
this goofy motherfucker.
- Hey, officers. Lookey here.
You got two young bucks
'round the corner.
One in the white tee,
the other guy a throwback on.
One got the jump his dip.
And the one with
a car tire, ya feel me?
'Round the corner?
Fulton and Lex.
A-ight.
Thanks, man.
Yeah.
Mr. Hanning?
It's an honor for me
to meet you, sir.
Who are you?
My name's Gus Haynes.
I edited the story
you're featured in.
- Then you're
a fucking liar.
- Omar.
It's omar, yo.
- Gotta giddy
up an' go, dawg.
Get!
One...
Two...
Three...
Four.
Ya see there?
Omar know which one it is.
Look like all your muscle
done up and indisposed now.
So you might as well go ahead
and drop it out, ya feel me?
I'm a blast
to walk up in there now--
I'm a blast
to walk up in there now--
You workin'
a Stanfield corner,
which means you workin'
for a straight up punk.
Ya feel me?
I'm out here in these streets
every day.
Me an' my lonesome.
An' where he at? Huh?
Yo, y'all put it in his ear.
Marlo Stanfield is not
a man for this town.
Ya dig?
Mmm-hmm--
Yeah--
Yeah, eight men, four cars.
Ellis briefed 'em.
They know what's what.
No, they're just happy
for the O.T.
Look, don't worry, Lester.
- Just sign the motherfucker
and shut the fuck up.
Gimme.
We ready?
'cause you gotta figure
an extra hour
to get 'round the capital
beltway this time of day.
You ever done
an F.B.I. profile before?
Once.
How'd it go?
Oh, they take your file,
read you back some shit
you already know.
Then why do it?
So that we can say we did.
- Need a pack of Newport.
Soft pack.
- Need a pack of Newport.
Soft pack.
And let me get one
of them, too--
Ahhhh!
Don't shoot!
- Lowenthal.
Where the fuck is he?
Um, he's, uh--
There you go, Bunk.
- Hey. Request for
a D.N.A. comparison.
case 06H271.
Latent trace
to obtained samples.
And it's a part of
the serial killer thing.
It's now a part
of that investigation.
Well, that's different.
If it's connected
to that investigation--
- it is. It is, here.
It's in my notes.
- I never said
I was in a fire fight.
Not on that day.
- I'm sorry, but you did.
- I told you the lead vehicle
took a hit from an elevated I.E.D.
killed the fifty gunner,
and blew the hands
off the driver.
That's it.
That's enough, man.
Why you go and make
the rest of that shit up?
- I didn't make anything up.
We sat there having coffee--
Coffee--
- Having donuts and coffee.
- And you said--
- What I say?
- Can I finish?
- I don't know.
I'm hearing about coffee
and donuts, I'm not hearing--
- Can I finish? If you're not going
to let me tell my side of the story--
- A lie ain't a side of the story,
it's just a lie.
- I don't have to listen to this--
- Okay-- hey, Scott,
let's just relax here.
Both you gentlemen, let's just
step back here, please?
Now, Mr. Hanning, forgive me,
but do you drink much?
- You think I fucking sleep
under a bridge sober?
- Sometimes when I have a few--
And I do like to have a few--
I tend to be a little more
descriptive in the telling of a tale.
In fact--
- I know what it
is to tell a story.
I've told plenty in my time.
But there's some things
that happen,
you don't ever fuck with them.
Scott?
- I believe you, mr. Hanning.
I believe that you believe.
That you believe
you told me one thing.
But, sir, with all
due respect and gratitude
for you and the service
you gave to this country,
you didn't tell me that thing.
You told me something else.
I wrote what mr. Hanning
told me.
Mr. Hanning--
- I know you probably--
- What if one of the guys,
what if a marine
who was there--
He reads that shit
that you made up?
That's why
I come down here today.
What if one of the guys
sees that?
Man, get him outta my face.
- Guy's just off.
Off in general.
Off his meds.
I dunno, but off.
A lot of them are, you know.
- I mean, I hate to say it--
- Yeah, he puts on a good front.
We'll call the marines,
get a service record,
reach out to some people
in his unit,
find out what the fuck happened
that day outside of--
What was it? Fallujah?
Yeah.
- Alright, if it went down
the way you said,
we'll let it be.
But if not, we'll chalk it up
as a misunderstanding.
But misunderstanding or no,
we will write a correction if
what we printed wasn't accurate.
- And we didn't have coffee.
We had chocolate milk.
- You Miss what you had, though?
- I still got too much dog in me
to be settled like that.
It wasn't Cheryl. It was me.
Thing is, is I found a connect
with the boy, you know?
That part of it
feels right to me.
Kids are great.
Yeah.
What about you an' Beadie?
You were quiet there
for a time.
Yeah.
Bunk once told me
I'm no good for people.
Everyone around me,
he said.
Was he drunk?
- Yeah. But still.
- Omar be dead.
I'm tellin' you.
Heard that before.
F'real.
You see him?
- Seen his dead ass
layin' right up in there.
Boy up on the corner say
he try to rob them Koreans
and got kilt.
- You shoulda let me give him
the years, Bunk.
He'da been better off.
Thanks for calling.
- Figured you'd wanna see this,
you being so tight with the mope.
Professional job here.
- Nah. Thought so at first,
but the Korean broad
we sent downtown
said he got done in by a short
little fella with a big gun.
Shit, walked in
an' lit his ass up.
How short?
The boy robbed him?
- Counterlady said the hoppers
all ran up in here
afterward for souvenirs.
Took his shotty
and his semiauto too.
Ran all through his pockets.
Be my guest.
- Back on the hunt, were you?
- Youngun say
he out here with no car,
walkin' with a limp an' shit.
He gonna fall, Chris.
You gonna see.
Marlo need a meet.
For real?
- Leander, where we at?
Still setting this up.
Why, did you catch
another one?
- Six-fifty-five
and thirty-four.
- Well, we're not
on anybody yet,
so we'll pick it up
in the morning.
- Alright. Later.
Okay.
Doze, Truck,
you're on Monk Metcalf.
Bobby, you and Brian
are on Chris Partlow.
He usually rides
with Snoop Pearson,
but if they split,
Karen and Tony
will pick up on her.
Marcus, Angela--
You're the backup unit
when we need one.
- You're gonna be Stanfield?
- Yeah.
All their business
is face-to-face,
and they meet in the open
several times a day.
We're just trying to find
the pattern in the meets.
- Where do we pick
these guys up?
- Stanfield has every corner
between M.L.K. and Monroe,
and they start shaping it up
around eleven or so, okay?
That's when the re-up orders
start coming in,
that's when you'll start to see
monk making the rounds.
Most mornings, Marlo starts off
with a parley or two
on the playground
between Mosher and Lanvale.
Now, these guys
seem to be wholesaling, too.
Other dealers, players--
Anyone who wants to get
with him gets him there, okay?
Chris and Snoop
are usually with him.
And McNulty's got you
covered for paperwork.
None of what we do here
is necessary for court,
so rest easy on that,
alright?
So we stage here
tomorrow at nine.
No sign of him,
but I ain't on nothin' else
for as long as it take.
- You ain't heard?
Omar bagged up.
Shit, I thought y'all
was gonna tell me.
I just got the word myself
from Monk.
- Who got him?
- Some young boy.
- Who?
- Ain't heard a name.
Don't even know
if there was a why.
Hopper wanna hear a pop,
see the damage, ya know?
Yeah-- that shit is gone.
We done with this
next resupply,
you an' me got some time
in A.C. coming to us, don't we?
- Forensically, this guy
is all over the map.
Sexual to a point,
but inhibited.
Nocturnal on some,
diurnal on the others.
And the notion of targeting
the homeless, to begin with?
Well, we've only seen that
a couple times before,
but in those instances, it's
been someone within that cohort.
And they're not usually
carrying cell phones
and calling newspapers.
- You caught
a strange one here.
- Detectives,
hey, don't get up.
Arthur Toland,
deputy director of the unit.
Just wanted to drop by
and make sure
we're progressing your case.
Yeah, yeah.
Great. Thanks.
- You might recognize
the director from television.
He's done all of them.
- You know those news shows.
Always want a talking head
when a case comes up.
Greta van Susteren,
Nancy Grace, Chris Matthews,
that fella with the big
forehead, whatshisname--
Larry King?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, what the hell.
It's a chance to get the word
out for the bureau.
And I sell some books.
"Human Hunters: The rise
of the American serial killer"?
They've used a lot of my stuff
on those C.s.I. shows.
I've consulted for them.
You haven't heard--
So, how long you been doing
death investigations?
Eight years.
We don't see a lot of
serial stuff actually.
Drug murders.
A street robbery
every now and then.
- Three hundred or so
a year.
- Well, you've got
a serial case now,
so, I'll leave you to it.
Good hunting.
- Art was actually
lead investigator
on the unabomber thing.
- That was like
sixteen years, right?
Yeah.
- Yeah, then his brother
ratted him out?
- Homeless is in
at thirty inches.
It's good shit there.
No really.
There was a real
sense of place,
especially under
the Hanover bridge
when the police came up
under there to give the warning.
Drama in small moments
like that.
- Truth is,
I had a tour guide.
Yeah?
- Yeah, fella I met
at a soup kitchen.
Volunteer there.
Ex-addict.
There's something
about this guy.
I mean, he's just--
I dunno, the more he talked,
the more I felt like
it was him I really
wanted to write about.
- Yeah?
- But he's not homeless.
And I don't have
any peg for him.
Shit, I don't know
what the story is.
Does he got a name?
Reginald Cousins.
- Volunteers at a soup kitchen.
What's he do for money?
- Sells the "Baltimore Sun"
every morning
out by Light Street.
- Well, shit not exactly
a growth industry, huh?
- He lives in his
sister's basement.
She'll take a plate down
to him every now and then,
but she won't let him
come up the stairs.
- Spend some time with him.
- What about
the neighborhoods beat?
The homeless coverage?
You're covered.
Take a couple weeks,
see what you see.
A-ight?
- Late entries
from the copshop.
Two dead in a
Charles county housefire,
and a homicide
from the city.
- Ettlin,
what do we got room for?
- We're shy one brief
in the metro digest.
Four paragraphs'll fill.
What's the homicide?
- The 34-year-old black male
shot dead in
West Baltimore grocery.
Juvenile suspect
is being sought.
Write up the fire.
Scratch the murder.
We don't have room.
- So what we conclude
from a behavioral analysis
of the known forensics
is the following:
The suspect is likely
a white male,
in his late twenties
to late thirties.
He likely is not
a college graduate,
but feels
nonetheless superior
to those with
advanced education,
and he is likely employed
in a bureaucratic entity,
possibly civil service
or quasi-public service,
from which
heeels alienated.
He has a problem
with authority
and a deep-seated resentment
of those who he feels
have impeded his progress
professionally.
The minimized sexual activity
suggests
that this is not a primary
motive for the killings.
In fact, the bite marks
in the last found victim--
Lacking the D.N.A. of saliva--
Indicate to us possible
post-mortem staging.
The suspect has trouble
with lasting relationships
and is possibly
a high-functioning alcoholic,
with alcohol being utilized
as a trigger
in the commission
of these crimes.
His resentment
of the homeless
may stem from
a personal relationship
with someone
who is in that cohort,
or his victimization
of vagrants
might merely present
an opportunity for him
to assert his superiority
and intellectual prowess.
If you get more,
fax it down,
and we can
update the profile.
Thanks for everything.
Thanks.
So, what do you think?
They're in the ballpark.
- Look, congressman,
I'll do whatever it takes
to make things right
between us,
but running Dobey in the primary
is only gonna hurt everybody.
You mean hurt you.
- All due respect,
I'm the only viable candidate
to beat that republican prick,
and I know you know that.
And, at the end of the day,
isn't that what it's all about?
Do not waste your breath
tellin' me what I already know
about our tax-cutting,
dump-it-on-the-counties,
ass-kiss-every-business-interest governor.
P.G. county has a hundred murders
a year,
school system held together
with spit and glue,
and worse rush-hour traffic
than Atlanta.
And the man in Annapolis
wouldn't piss on us
if we were on fire.
- Don't hold back, congressman.
- I'm tired of these
fuckin' republicans.
- Look, I fucked up
not coming to see you earlier.
But between the votes
I can pull outta Baltimore,
Montgomery and your county,
I am gonna take the statehouse.
And then the frustration
that you feel is gonna end.
I know you've heard this before
from every other sonofabitch,
but congressman,
I give you my word.
- You know, you're right.
I have heard that before.
You wanna keep P.G. county
in your camp,
it's gonna cost you
a lot more than your word.
Fuck.
You rang?
Funny case you got here.
Your victim had an address.
A home. Paid rent,
so we assume,
maybe even a mortgage.
But not homeless,
in any case.
No strangulation,
no red ribbon--
Christopher Partlow.
A lesser man might get pissy
because you jumped the line,
Bunk.
Me?
I remember Partlow's name
from all those cases last year.
Congrats.
Yeah.
- But don't fuck with me
like this again.
Yeah. Yeah.
- He lied on his mortgage
application, huh?
You know, we have a name
for that over here.
- Yeah, the headshot.
I know.
- On a mortgage charge,
he's certain to plead out.
- Billy doesn't plead
his clients.
- Then he's looking
at a lot of years.
A federal jury is
a very different animal
than what they see
on Calvert Street.
- I tried to tell them that--
- Yeah, but mister Bond
wanted to try is himself,
see if he couldn't grandstand
his way to city hall.
Well, you have the headshot,
detective.
But no gun with which
to fire it.
We can't take this case.
It's all on paper.
- You had canceled checks.
You had bank accounts.
You had his bag man
on the stand.
We had a city jury.
- You know, we've been gathering
string on Clay Davis
for six years, detective.
Six years, we've had a file open
on that shakedown artist.
And now, after you
city sons of bitches
have managed, in a single week,
to transform Clay fucking Davis
into Martin Luther King, jr.,
you now come to me with this--
Which you had in your
back pocket all along--
Looking for the federal jury
of mostly white faces
to remedy the problem?
Well, I'm sorry.
Thank you.
What's this?
- From the pocket
of a dead stick-up boy.
Omar Little.
Omar? Dead?
- You stop readin'
the twenty-fours?
Killed yesterday
at a grocery.
Slow to the draw,
he was.
No shit.
- One to the back
of the head.
Norris and Crutchfield
caught it.
They're looking
for a juvenile.
He was hunting
Stanfield and crew.
And this was on him?
Yep.
Thought of you and Lester
when I saw it.
Payback for you getting me
back some great lab.
Positive D.N.A.
on Chris Partlow.
An alley beating, not one
of the ones in the vacants.
Motherfucker.
You have all kinds
of news today, don't you?
- Yeah, going for a warrant
right now.
- Hey, can you wait
to serve it?
We're right at the edge, Bunk.
How long?
'cause this is an honest
fuckin' murder prosecution here.
I'll talk to Lester.
Congrats.
- Yeah.
No shuckin', no jivin'.
Just good ol' police work.
How about that, Jimmy?
Hey, without my bullshit,
you're still waiting
on lab work.
- Listen, Jimmy, the Conaway
shooting from Westport?
The transvestite?
I go to VICAP, there's
another one just like it--
Look-- down in Carolina,
four months ago.
For a road car
and two nights in a hotel,
I can put this down.
- What are you
talking about?
Yours is a 9 mm,
this one's a 32.
Yours was a bar pick-up,
this one's a home invasion--
- Still worth checking out.
- I don't see it. Sorry.
- You're gonna make me
spit it out, aren't you--
You ever played Hilton head?
I get a call from my
brother-in-law a few days ago.
He managed to swing
a tee-time for this weekend.
Jimmy, I'm going, goddammit.
The fuck do I care? Go.
- You know, this is some real
cute shit you're pulling here.
Taking the detail money
and doling it around
like a priest passing wafers.
Now, I don't know
exactly what you're up to,
but I know this: If someone
picked up a phone around here,
your shit is critically fucked.
Two nights and a road car.
- Leander, I'm showing ten-fifty-five
and thirty-four from Marlo's phone.
Anybody on the move?
- I got him coming eastbound
on Baltimore Street at Calhoun.
Who's on Monk?
Wait one.
Twenty-three-oh-six
to twenty-three-eleven.
Where you at, man?
Twenty-three-eleven.
Southbound M.L.K.
approaching route forty.
That's the meet, Lester.
Monk and Marlo on the westside.
We on it.
- Corner of Argyle and Dolphin.
Monk and Marlo, as expected.
- Now I got four-forty and
thirty-five coming into Marlo's phone.
- Yeah, he's scoping that, Lester.
- We know it ain't Monk callin'.
- Twenty-three-oh-six
to twenty-three-twelve.
Twenty-three twelve.
Who do you have eyes on?
Both my subjects.
- They go to
their cell phones?
Negative.
They on the move?
Negative.
Twenty-three-fourteen.
- We got nothing moving either.
- No one elscalling or moving.
- Means we got somebody else
on this network
we don't yet know.
Oh, boy.
- Hey, man.
Let me give you a hand.
Alright, you ready?
ah.
- I don't have no money
in the moment,
but I'll be going down
to the scales in a hour or two.
You help me out,
I'll go ten for your trouble.
You help me out,
I'll go ten for your trouble.
Got a rag
for that behind you.
Junk!
Junkman!
Junk! Junk!
Junkman! Junk!
- Where the fuck are you going?
- Oh, uh, I gotta see Lester about--
What's all that?
- Parole info on known
sex offenders for five zip codes.
I've also got background
info on my desk
for everyone we picked up
at pier five with a cell phone.
- You're actually gonna--
- Compare the F.B.I. profile
with every person of interest
I can find.
Hell yeah, somebody's gotta.
- Come here.
- The fuck are you doin'?
Come here.
- Maurice Dobey?
For governor?
Of my state? Sheet.
That's some cynical politics,
right there.
Playin' like you gonna
run a man you know can't win
to scare people
into payin' off.
- Dobey could
bloody you up, Tommy.
In Baltimore and P.G. both.
- Playin' that race card.
Shameful.
- What does Upshaw want
to stay out of the race?
Too much.
Are you going to pay?
- Well, let's just say
I'm in negotiations.
- Well, I'll do everything
I can to make sure
this insurrection
doesn't spread into the city.
- Wonderful! And how much
is the loyal support
of the eastside democratic
coalition going to cost me?
- Only an endorsement,
given that this man right here
is still standing,
I don't believe that Rupert Bond
is going to find his way
into this office.
Do you?
And for my endorsement,
you will return the favor
and ignore our friends
in Prince George's.
And the loyalty
of the westside
is going to cost me
what exactly?
Oh, nothin' big.
You got three seats comin' open
on the liquor board.
You get one seat.
Two, and you have me out there
raising money for you in the primary.
Sold. And Clay, it scares me
to think of the damage
you could do with two votes
on the liquor board.
It ain't right.
No... It just is.
No, I mean, you can't do this.
We're doing it. Whatever
they give us to work the bullshit,
I throw it to Lester.
Or Crutchfield, or Norris,
or Anyone else who has a case
that oughta be solved.
it was bad enough I wasted your day
yesterday going to Quantico,
I can't stand to see you wasting
any more time on this,
you should be back working
your home invasion.
- Jimmy, you can't do this.
- A couple days more.
Lester gets his best shot
at Marlo, after that
we'll never hear from
the reprimande killer again.
Bosses will lose interest, I'll pretend
to run out of little more string.
And then it goes right back to
the admin office. No harm, no foul.
Whatever you need, Kima...
to work your triple,
or any case that matters to you.
Manpower, O.T., labwork, cars...
Just let me know.
I gotta go.
Wake up!
Hey, bug! Up here.
Hold, boy.
I'll get you that 10 tomorrow.
And if you're looking for work,
I got work needs lifting.
You know the stable on Booth Street?
Be there before 9.
Dang, dukie,
you ain't ready now?
I'm showing 5:15 and 34 seconds.
I'm up Park Heights,
but I lost him just past the park.
M.T.A. bus clipped a curb
and it knocked down
a utility pole.
By the time I detoured,
he slipped me good.
Well, let me know.
Big news.
Bunk has a murder warrant
on Chris Partlow.
The hell you say.
- Not one from the vacants.
D.N.A. match
on an alley beating.
He lets this go now,
these guys are gonna
go to ground.
We're right at the edge
of something here.
- He's giving us
a couple of days.
He owes me.
I expedited his lab work
for it.
Oh, and Omar Little?
Stickup-boy?
What about him?
- Caught one in a Korean joint
over westside.
Bunk pulled that
out of his pocket.
Mean anything at all to us?
- Look's like he was
after Marlo's crew.
Cheese. Cheese Wagstaff?
In addition to their corners,
these guys are wholesaling
all over town at this point,
so I figured cheese
was just one of many.
- Note reads like Omar
had him under Marlo'wing.
A lieutenant, at least.
Anyway, I gotta go,
do more pretending
for the rest of the city.
Oh, by the way,
I--I told Greggs.
- Oh, McNulty.
How many more people--
- She was about to jump into
the serial murders with both feet.
I couldn't stand
to spin her like that--
How'd she take it?
- Twenty-three-oh-six to
any twenty-three sequence.
Trying to reconnect
with my subject.
- Anyone near Northwest
who can assist?
- Twenty-three-fifteen
to twenty-three-oh-six.
I'm in the twenty-eight
hundred block
Edgecombe Circle south,
sitting on the female subject.
Maybe that's the other end
of your meet.
Edgecombe Circle?
Where's that, twenty?
It runs off Pall mall.
Where's Pall mall?
I'm not too good up
in the Northwest.
It's between Pimlico--
- Never mind, I got a map book.
Okay, see what we got here.
Map thirty-four,
grid e-three.
Thirty-four, e-three,
thirty-four, e-three--
Three--
Whaddya got?
- Lester, what'd that
last clock show?
- And these people that I
share the stage with tonight
are here as representatives
of the hundreds,
no, the thousands of citizens
without shelter,
without protection,
in this city tonight.
Why does this have to be?
Certainly, the last seven years
have not brought the same levels
of federal commitment
to American cities as from
previous administrations.
And certaiy, our governor
has in the last year
placed severe restrictions on whatever
stopgap state programs were in place.
And what little remained
of our so-called safety net
was simply shredded,
and more and more
of our fellow citizens
found themselves living life
at the broken edges,
in the street.
Well, I say that this is
not on tragic,
it is unforgivable!
And I am here to say
that no longer can these people
with whom I share this stage
tonight be invisible,
just, just, just as all of those
without shelter in this city,
in this country, can
no longer be invisible to us.
And it is regrettable
that it has taken the actions
of a remorseless predator
to make us reflect.
But we in Baltimore
have been tested,
and we have been taught
that all of our citizens
deserve the full protection
of the law,
and the full support
of the community.
And we are saying
to this senseless killer,
and to all the other ills
that prey on those
without shelter in our city--
Not tonight
can you prey on them.
And not tomorrow.
Not any longer.
We will protect you!
Thank you.
- She asked you keep
that one stirred.
- Hey, you were
on my thing, right?
I guess I owe you
a drink on that.
What's your poison?
- I'm okay, senator,
thank you very much.
Obonda, huh?
That's a good one.
You know, that was mostly my
evidence you beat back there, right?
You think you
could do that again?
Excuse me?
- 'Cept this time,
the jury's a federal one.
Say, nine white, three black.
- Time for you
to tip on out, detective.
- Bank records
on that mortgage application
you made on the Calvert county
property years back.
Now, why don't you
take that back to Billy Murphy?
Ask your attorney
what you're exposed to.
At this point, this is just between
us two gentlemen here, senator.
And no one else
till I make it so.
What?
You tryin' to sell
a case back to me?
Motherfucker,
if you don't get--
- I don't get paid
like that.
I get paid when
I come back up in here
a couple nights time
with questions.
And you, sir, have answers.
Or my next call will be
to the U.S. Attorney's office,
and we will go again.
But for real.
You can keep tt copy.
Ma'am.
You can keep that copy.
Ma'am.
- Just to let you know,
before the fireworks start,
I'm spiking this lede
and I'll play it straight.
But you got back?
As best I can.
Scott!
I'm spiking your lede.
I'm not running a story
about a public gathering--
A candlelight vigil
at city hall, in fact--
Where the lede anecdote and quote
is from an unnamed homeless woman.
- She doesn't want to be
known as homeless.
I explained that.
- Scott, there were hundreds of
homeless down there tonight--
People who voluntarily
attended this event.
And I'm gonna guess
that any number of them
would've let you put
their names in the paper.
- But her story is great.
Look at that quote--
It's a perfect quote.
Best quote
I could ever ask for.
Jesus Christ.
To hell with you
if you think I made it up.
- We have a standard
that we follow here.
And I'm gonna follow it.
Here it comes, Gus.
Yep.
- Gus, you're retopping
Scott's vigil copy?
I am.
But I thought--
- Anonymous attribution
in a public setting.
There's no need for it.
Gus, let's discuss this.
- Actually, I did discuss it.
I discussed it with
the metro editor,
and he agrees.
Now, the story's
on the copy desk,
and as a line editor
working this story,
I feel I've done my job.
Now, you as the M.E.,
if you want to go another way,
you pull the story back
and re-edit.
But we have a sourcing
policy here,
and I knowt,
and I do not feel comfortable
bending the rules
in this instance.
G'night.
Yeah?
- McNulty, it's Christeson.
Listen, my case is down an'
I wanted to thank you.
I couldn't have done it
otherwise.
No problem.
Hey. It went great.
Kids asleep?
- Yeah, but they saw you
on W.B.A.L.
Anna said your hair
looked funny.
- Well, just so long as
she was impressed.
CNN was there.
I wonder if they'll cycle
any coverage through tonight.
- A good day
for his honor, huh?
I dunno.
Nerese shook me down
for a mayoral endorsement,
and Clay Davis,
back from the grave,
took a couple
liquor board seats.
Just so as they won't join
in Upshaw's little warparty
down in Prince George's.
- You're gonna endorse Nerese?
You told me you prefer Bond.
- I do, but this thing
with Upshaw--
Shit, I might even
have to give him a bump
just to calm him down.
- God. What's he asking?
There-- look.
What's Upshaw asking?
- Half of any extra school
or anti-crime money
I get outta the legislature
for Baltimore
would go to P.G. county.
- You take that deal
and Baltimore's out
half of what you want to bring
back to the city schools.
- Yeah, but if I don't win, Jen,
I bring back exactly nothing.
Look.
- And we are saying
to this senseless killer,
and to all the other ills--
- Go on. Straight to bed.
Hey, kiddo.
Hey, McNulty.
Where'd you go to?
- None of your business
really, Jimmy.
Next time,
I'm not going anywhere.
Next time, you're gonna
be out on your ass,
because that's my fucking house.
That's police work, son.
- I pull the A.D.C. book
to find a location,
and I'm on the same page number
as the second hand.
And I remember
we had a lotta clocks
with thirty-four seconds.
- That's a page
from West Baltimore.
Right.
Now, the second hand
is always the map page.
Longitude, A-through-K,
is the hour,
and for the latitude, they go
by five-minute intervals.
Now they know
the meeting spot in advance,
and they code it
by the grid square.
But if the clock
has nothing to do with time,
how do they know when to meet?
- Everything's less than
a half hour of driving,
even in traffic.
My guess is
that the standing logic
is that they meet
within an hour or so.
You know what else
makes sense?
This clock face when no one
was on the move?
The times are all
at thirty-five seconds.
And that's the page
for East Bawlmer.
Cheese.
Cheese Wagstaff?
- Marlo's wholesaling
on the westside through Monk,
and on the eastside with Cheese.
He's got the whole goddamn city.
- How do we know it's Cheese?
oh--
You, too, huh?
You all are good with this?
Kima--
Not me.
All the guys at the bar,
Jimmy?
All the girls?
They don't show up
at your wake.
Not because
they don't like you
but because they never
knew your last name.
A month later, someone tells 'em
"oh, Jimmy died."
"Jimmy who?"
"Jimmy the cop."
"Ohh," they say. "Him."
And all the people on the job,
all the people you spent all
those hours in the radio car with,
the guys with their feet up
on their desk telling stories,
who shorted you
on the food runs,
who signed your
overtime slips.
In the end, they're not
gonna be there either.
Family. That's it.
Family.
And if you're lucky,
one or two friends
who are the same as family.
That's all
the best of us get.
Everything else is just--
- There is no serial killer.
There are no murders.
I made it all up.
They were-- they were
shutting us down.
They were-- they were just--
It's hard to explain.
I don't even know
where the anger comes from.
I don't know
how to make it stop.
They fucking task me, they do.
We took the money from
the bullshit investigation,
and we routed it to Lester.
Now he's got the cake
to take down Marlo Stanfield.
And now that I've
done all this--
Now that I've
watched myself do it,
I can't even stand to--
Lester says he's close.
Time will pass,
and I'll be able
to shut this thing down.
If you don't go to jail.
You had no fucking right.
- I know.
- This is my life, too.
You start to tell the story;
you think you're the hero.
And then, when you get done
talking, you--
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
- 23-16.
- Oui, Lester.
- T'es où ?
- Sur Monk dans East Baltimore.
- Qui suit Marlo ?
- Personne.
Marlo est difficile à suivre.
Trop parano. Trop de contre-surveillance.
Lâche Monk et dirige-toi vers l'autoroute
Broening, direction la gare maritime.
Carte 44,
G, comme George, 10.
- 44.
- Oui. Nouvel emplacement.
S'ils vont aussi loin,
il se peut qu'il...
- Exactement.
- J'y vais.
23-06 à toutes les unités 23.
Nouvel emplacement: Carte 44.
G comme George, 10.
Je répète: 44,
G comme George, 10.
Repérez les véhicules
des suspects.
23-12. Bien reçu.
Ça va me prendre du temps
depuis le nord-est. Je reste sur Cheese ?
Non. Nouvel emplacement est la priorité.
On est sur une rafle.
- Oui ?
- McNulty ? Ça y est.
- Vraiment ?
- Oh, que oui.
D'accord...
"Ce n'est pas une question
de s'il le mérite ou pas." -Snoop
Alors, qu'est-ce que t'as ?
On a roulé jusqu'à
ce que Bobby voie Chris Partlow
se garer dans un terrain
à deux rues d'ici.
On a attendu Marlo. Ils ont parlé
une minute, puis Marlo est parti.
Chris est allé à la porte de l'entrepôt seul
et des gars blancs ont ouvert.
Il est à l'intérieur là ?
La porte de devant est la seule qui ouvre,
les autres sont rouillées.
- Qui surveille l'avant ?
- Deux unités.
Ils sont à pied, à une rue d'ici.
Ils voient tout ce qui entre et sort.
On fait quoi si Chris sort ?
Laissez-le. Partlow est un fier-à-bras.
Il vérifie que tout est réglo.
Et si ça l'est,
Monk ou un autre viendra ici.
- Ou Cheese.
- C'est un réapprovisionnement.
Tu rigoles ?
Ici, au milieu de nulle part...
À des kilomètres, d'où ils se rencontrent...
C'est un ravitaillement, oui.
À part Chris,
quiconque entre là-dedans,
si c'est un lieutenant de Stanfield,
il en ressort sale.
Suivez-le. S'il nous repère pas,
voyons où il nous mène.
S'il flaire quelque chose, foncez.
Arrêtez-le, et prenez la came.
Et emparez-vous des cellulaires
avant qu'il puisse effacer quoi que ce soit.
Tout se trouve dans les téléphones...
Il nous faudra un mandat aux termes
du Titre IIl pour les examiner.
Où est-ce que tu vas ?
C'est l'heure de vérité.
C'est clair entre nous ?
Hé, c'est clair entre nous ?
Les armes étaient à moi.
Lesquelles ?
Celles que la police a trouvées
dans le camion. Elles sont à moi.
Même si j'y ai jamais touché.
Fais ta part aussi.
Avec vos antécédents, M. Hill,
vous risquez deux, voire trois ans maxi.
Vous serez bien compensé,
j'imagine.
Tu nous sers plus à rien
sur tes trois pattes !
Familiarisez-vous avec les modèles
de ses fameuses armes.
- Le détail importe.
- On me tire dessus, et maintenant ça.
- Plutôt exigeant, hein ?
- Hé, va donc à Walmart,
voir s'ils peuvent s'occuper de toi
pendant que tu guéris.
Viens.
Seigneur. Dans la police,
si t'es blessé en service,
ils te laissent le temps de t'en remettre,
puis, tu choisis ta prochaine affectation.
Marlo tient son équipage plus serré.
Ouvre-le.
Six compartiments à glace,
20 chacun.
Tu comptes, on attend.
Tu comptes pas,
on va dîner plus tôt.
23-14 à 23-06.
Suspect numéro 3 est dedans.
- T'es sûr ?
- Je suis ce camion depuis une semaine.
- Je devrais savoir.
- Bien reçu.
Une tique, ça a six ou huit pattes ?
Ça n'a pas dû être facile de revenir.
C'était un poste bien agréable à Londres,
je ne peux pas le nier.
Mon seul regret, c'est
de ne pas avoir fait les trois ans.
- Merci.
- Cela ne porte pas atteinte sur toi.
Imagine, Gus, ils ont même vendu
l'édifice à Kensington.
On l'avait acheté
pour une bouchée de pain il y a 50 ans
et aujourd'hui, Chicago le revend
pour deux millions de livres.
Ils appellent ça la capitalisation.
Ces chaînes de journaux
n'en ont rien à foutre, hein ?
Aucune idée d'où tu vas être affecté
maintenant que tu es de retour ?
Non, pas la moindre idée.
Klebanow veut dîner avec moi,
je le saurai bien assez vite.
- T'es prêt pour quelque chose ?
- Ça dépend quoi.
J'ai un problème.
J'ai besoin de quelqu'un...
Un journaliste vétéran, subtile,
discret, observateur,
et qui sait couvrir ses traces...
Peu importe depuis quand on se connaît,
je tuerai jamais ta femme pour toi !
Tu connais Scott Templeton ?
Affaires municipales.
Le gars qui parle aux sans-abri ?
Pas vraiment.
- Il a été embauché après mon départ.
- C'est mieux comme ça.
Pas d'opinions,
d'un côté comme de l'autre.
Non, non, je dis rien.
J'ai besoin d'un nouveau regard
sur ce gars. Un regard minutieux.
- Un des chouchous de Whiting, non ?
- J'ai dit discret.
- J'espère que tu as tort.
- Bien sûr.
- Ça pique !
- Évidemment, c'est du fil barbelé.
Ça sert à ça.
Allez.
On n'a pas toute la journée.
Dépêche-toi. Prends les tiges
d'aluminium d'abord.
- Comment je fais pour sortir ?
- Tu passes par-dessus.
Tu devrais mieux y arriver
la seconde fois.
Prends les tubes d'acier
avant qu'on se fasse repérer.
- Bon retour parmi nous.
- Merci.
J'ai besoin d'une sortie imprimée
de tous les articles signés Scott Templeton.
Tous types d'édition.
Je suis un fan, que veux-tu ?
23-14.
Monk se dirige vers l'ouest sur O'Donnell.
Cheese Wagstaff arrive.
Le camion qu'on a vu
sur le quai de chargement repart.
Il est vide. Ils ont dû tout décharger
dans le dépôt.
Bobby et moi, on suit Monk.
Karen suit Cheese. Vous restez devant.
En mettant de côté
cette affaire de tueur en série,
on a promis une chute à deux chiffres
du taux de criminalité.
Et au beau milieu des primaires,
on enregistre à un nouveau record.
Michael, les réductions budgétaires
ont paralysé ce département.
Ça fait un an qu'on n'a
ni les effectifs ni les outils.
- Vous les avez maintenant.
- C'est comme un navire,
ou un super tank. On ne peut pas
tout faire virer comme ça.
Plus de patrouilles, plus de voitures...
Reprenez les choses en main.
Vous voyez, ce n'est pas comme ça
que ça marche.
Plus de policiers dans les rues,
une police plus visible,
plus de voitures,
des policiers brandissant le drapeau
pour pouvoir dire
que vous luttez contre le crime.
Sauf votre respect, ce qui marche
c'est créer quelque chose de dissuasif.
Prendre le temps de s'organiser...
Ne pas courir après les résultats,
- mais faire du vrai travail.
- Qui vous a aidé jusqu'ici, hein ?
Notre maire m'avait dit
qu'il n'y aurait plus de rustine,
plus de guerre de statistiques...
Seulement le budget scolaire nous
est tombé dessus et on n'a pas eu le temps
de travailler sur tout
ce dont vous me parlez.
Je comprends. On va s'y pencher.
On soutiendra ce genre de réforme,
que ce soit de l'hôtel de ville
ou d'Annapolis, si besoin est.
Mais pour le moment, mon patron
a besoin que la criminalité baisse.
Pas dans trois ans.
Pas même dans un an.
Il a besoin d'une baisse de 10%
au prochain trimestre...
Ou personne ne sera en position
de faire aucune réforme.
Montrez-vous créatifs, messieurs.
Assistant.
Un détective vous attend dehors.
Il dit que c'est urgent.
J'ai trouvé une source avec Sydnor.
On a repris la surveillance
de Marlo Stanfield.
Et on est sur le point de prendre
ses hommes la main dans le sac.
- Quoi ?
- On a clos l'affaire Clay Davis
et au lieu de fermer les Crimes Majeurs,
on a repris notre boulot sur Marlo.
Avec les bons mandats,
on peut le faire tomber.
- Comment...
- On n'a pas le temps, Cedric.
Dans une heure, je vais avoir besoin...
Oui ?
- Lester...
- Quoi ?
On a ferré Monk.
Sale jusqu'aux oreilles.
Huit kilos de pure.
Non, quand on a essayé de l'arrêter,
il a détalé comme un lapin.
On l'a rattrapé sur Lafayette.
- Tu as le cellulaire ?
- Oui, je l'ai.
Joli travail.
La machine est lancée.
Il me faut une équipe pour arrêter Marlo
Stanfield, Chris Partlow et Cheese Wagstaff.
Quelqu'un du bureau
du procureur général doit préparer
un mandat de perquisition
pour l'entrepôt de Middle River.
Et j'oubliais...
Bunk Moreland
a un mandat d'arrêt contre Partlow
pour un meurtre lié à une autre affaire.
Il a attendu qu'on règle l'histoire.
Autre chose à me dire,
détective Freamon ?
Non, monsieur.
Je pense que vous êtes au fait.
- Allô ?
- Ronnie, ma chérie.
Salut.
- Tu es assise ?
- Pourquoi ?
Il essayait d'effacer des trucs
quand on l'a pris.
Sécurisez le périmètre.
Les mandats de perquisition arrivent.
C'est à la TV, yo.
...avec une valeur de plus
de 16 millions de dollars en héroïne,
et l'arrestation de trafiquants
qui allaient injecter ce poison
dans nos rues...
J'ai encore besoin de me faire
accuser à votre place ?
...et la persévérance
de notre service de police.
Alors que l'enquête suit son cours,
on me dit qu'il y aurait aussi
une inculpation pour meurtre
liée à cette organisation,
qui serait aussi responsable
pour les corps abandonnés
retrouvés l'an passé.
On n'avait pas abandonné cette enquête,
tout comme on essaie chaque jour
de s'atteler à la tâche de rendre
cette ville plus sûre et vibrante.
J'aimerais dire à tous ceux qui tentent de
mettre en péril le bien-être de cette ville,
un jour comme celui-ci vous attend.
Oh, quelle tapette.
On a vu ce que les drogues
ont fait à Baltimore.
La drogue ne détruit pas seulement
les individus, mais les familles aussi.
N'oublie pas les communautés.
Elle détruit des communautés entières.
Aujourd'hui, le maire de Baltimore,
le procureur général,
le service de police,
et les communautés disent:
"On en a eu assez." Merci.
Assistant commissaire.
Alma Gutierrez, du Sun.
Avez-vous un commentaire ?
C'est un bon jour pour les gentils.
Pouvez-vous nous en dire plus ?
La dernière fois, le Sun m'a fait faire
des choses que je n'avais pas faites.
- À quel sujet ?
- Un certain
coup bas que j'aurais fait.
Faites vos recherches.
"Une source d'information
"a identifié le transfert
de photos via les cellulaires."
Ça veut dire quoi ?
"Source d'information."
- Quelqu'un aurait parlé ?
- Qui était au courant ?
Je veux parler à l'avocat.
T'as pris pour meurtre aussi.
Disent la même merde ?
"D'après des informations reçues,
une analyse d'ADN sur la victime..."
- Ils ont ton ADN ?
- Un cheveu, faut croire.
"D'après des informations reçues".
Un mouchard, quoi.
D'où vient cette information ?
Les seuls à savoir sont ici.
- Snoop savait.
- Merde.
Et ton jeune Michael ?
Il a peut-être ouvert sa trappe.
- Il a été embarqué, non ?
- J'ai fait ce truc pour lui.
- Pourquoi est-ce qu'il parlerait ?
- On l'a testé dans les rues.
Peut-être différent une fois au poste.
Il a pas arrêté
de se montrer arrogant.
- S'emporte sur tout.
- Comme quoi ?
Chiale sur le sort de June Bug
et sa famille.
Chiale sur Omar qui te provoque
dans les rues pour que tu l'affrontes...
- Omar a fait quoi ?
- Rien.
Omar a essayé de t'insulter
pour te faire sortir.
- Qu'a-t-il dit ?
- Rien. Faisait que parler.
Il utilisait mon nom ?
Dans les rues ?
- Parlez, connards.
- Il a juste...
dit que tu devrais
avoir le cran de l'affronter...
J'en sais rien,
il racontait des conneries.
- Il m'a traité de marlou ?
- C'est des conneries.
- T'as pas besoin de ça.
- T'en sais quoi
de ce que j'ai besoin, connard ?
Mon nom était dans les rues ?
Quand on sortira d'ici,
j'irai à tous les coins de rue
et je leur dirai...
que personne m'avait rien dit.
Qu'il sache que Marlo n'a pas peur.
Ni d'Omar, ni de Barksdale, ni de personne.
Mon nom est mon nom.
- Je vois pas le jeune moucharder.
- Moi non plus.
Mais t'es prêt à parier ton avenir dessus ?
T'as vu, McNulty ?
T'as vu ?
Un seul détective, sur une affaire,
il suit des filons et boum...
il fait une arrestation.
Avec Chris Partlow sous les verrous,
des témoins vont commencer à parler
sur ces corps abandonnés.
- Ça va se régler.
- On a le principal, patron.
Un aujourd'hui, d'autres demain.
Grâce à quoi ?
À Bunk qui a travaillé
sur son affaire.
Du travail quoi.
Mais toi...
Avec tes heures sup, tes autos
et tes surveillances
et ta foutaise,
où est-ce que tu en es ?
Nulle part.
Il appelle plus.
Il tue plus, non plus.
Je l'avoue. J'avance pas.
Avec tout ce que tu as reçu,
ton cul devrait tirer des balles,
mais non, tu restes là,
assis sur tes vésicules génitales.
Allez, McNulty.
Donne-moi quelque chose.
Tu vas faire quoi maintenant ?
Laisser la moitié des effectifs
courir après du vent ?
Ça va se tasser.
Plus de meurtres, plus de disparitions,
plus d'appels.
- Marlo a été arrêté.
- J'emmerde Marlo.
Et je t'emmerde.
- Que se passe-t-il chez Klebanow ?
- Réunion de production.
- Soumissions au Pulitzer.
- Déjà ?
L'important,
c'est de couvrir ce sujet
jusqu'à la fin de l'année,
sans interruption.
Oui, et Scott, on doit chercher
là où la réponse au problème
peut être critiquée.
Les points faibles.
On ignore encore dans quelle catégorie
ont va la présenter,
mais dans les services publics,
on donne plus d'importance aux histoires
qui font changer la législation.
Donc couvrir les réactions à nos articles
est aussi important que les articles.
Jusqu'au Nouvel An, on s'acharne
sur tous les changements ou discussions
ou actions qui découlent
de notre couverture.
Notre présentation doit être nette
et professionnelle
quand elle arrivera au comité.
Vous croyez vraiment
que ça vaut un Pulitzer ?
Je le crois. Et ça le vaut.
Après deux mandats
au comité du Pulitzer,
j'ai vu comment ça marchait.
Il y a une façon de faire.
Une façon honorable.
Ils me paient rondement
pour savoir comment faire.
Bon. Que voulons-nous dire exactement
avec notre couverture ?
Que voulons-nous dire
sur les sans-abri ? C'est triste.
Très triste. Mais n'est-ce pas symptomatique
de quelque chose de plus grave...
On veut redécouvrir un monde
qui a trop longtemps été ignoré.
Examiner la tragédie
soulignée par ces meurtres, l'abandon...
- Le côté à la Dickens.
- Exactement.
Alma, ma très chère.
Cette citation de Daniels:
"C'est un bon jour pour les gentils."
- Il n'a rien trouvé de mieux à dire ?
- Il n'a pas voulu.
Dit qu'on a abusé de son nom
la dernière fois.
C'était quand ?
Quand on a dit qu'il avait fait
un coup bas à Burrell ?
Tu veux que j'appelle Daniels chez lui ?
Que je réessaie ?
- On a dépassé l'heure de tombée, Gus.
- J'enlève la citation.
D'accord.
Trinque avec moi, Jimmy.
C'est ce que tu voulais, mon gars.
Pourquoi je me sens si mal, alors ?
Dépression post-partum.
C'est le voyage, pas la destination...
On a attrapé Marlo Stanfield.
- Et le tueur en série ?
- C'est Marlo.
Daniels voulait que je sois
à la conférence de presse.
Avec tous ces autres
enfoirés enorgueillis
se tapant dans le dos
pour un travail bien fait.
Ils font partie du problème, tous.
Mais quand les menottes sortent
et la drogue est sur la table...
On fait encore des surveillances.
On protège encore les sans-abri,
on a des policiers déguisés
en sans-abri...
Tout ça s'arrêtera.
Ça s'arrête toujours.
Eh bien...
Si tu ne vas pas fêter ça avec moi,
tu vas au moins reconduire
ton ami ivre chez lui.
Shardene a intérêt d'être réveillée.
Parce que je crois que Lester Freamon
est prêt pour de l'amour...
Yo, je te dis que c'était Kenard.
La police s'est pointée trois fois
chez lui pour lui parler.
Foutaises.
Omar a été tué par les gars de Pimlico.
Ils lui ont sauté dessus
avec trois AK-47 et l'ont explosé.
- Quoi de neuf, soldat ?
- Je sais pas. À toi de me le dire.
Tout le monde a été coffré ?
Merde...
Ouais, du coup j'ai besoin de toi
pour des affaires sérieuses demain.
- Je connais ?
- Big Walter.
- Gros nez, Big Walter ?
- Non, petit Big Walter,
celui qui est toujours devant la petite
épicerie sur Calhoun et Riggs.
- Il est mêlé ?
- Marlo dit qu'il doit y passer.
C'est comme ça.
- Ça te pose un problème ?
- C'est cool.
Apporte pas ton arme.
J'ai un 9mm tout neuf pour toi,
sans numéro.
Je passe te prendre demain soir.
Ça va ?
- Ouais, ouais.
- D'accord.
En 5 ans, les États-Unis ont donné
15 milliards pour combattre le VIH
et le SIDA dans le monde.
Une fraction seulement va en Afrique,
où il y a une forte épidémie
du VIH et du SIDA.
10% de la population mondiale
vit en Afrique sub-Saharienne, mais 70%
des nouveaux cas de SIDA sont recensés là.
Au Kenya, une personne sur sept
est atteinte du VIH ou du SIDA.
Au Zimbabwe, une personne
sur quatre est malade,
selon un article du New York
Human Rights Law Review.
Le chef du service général de la santé
publique estime qu'il y a 22 millions de cas
dans ces pays africains.
Dans les 10 prochaines années,
il y aura eu plus de morts du SIDA
dans ces pays que dans
toutes les guerres du XXe siècle,
y compris la Seconde Guerre,
la plus mortelle de toutes.
Ça fait quoi, Bunny ?
Si j'avais son don pour parler,
j'aurais pu faire plus de bruit.
Regarde-le...
Ne te rabaisse pas.
Il a ta façon de défendre son cas.
Heureusement pour lui,
il ressemble plus à sa belle-maman.
Selon AIDS In Africa, l'argent des
États-Unis peut faire une grande différence,
là où même avec de petites sommes
on peut aller loin.
Il semblerait qu'il soit convenu
que l'argent soit utilisé de deux façons:
Les traitements médicaux
et l'éducation et la prévention.
Cependant, on ne sait pas combien
ni pour quels programmes...
- Comment on rebondit ?
- Je regarde les révisions du cautionnement.
Cheese pourrait sortir...
Avec une bonne assurance caution, la maison
de sa mère. Même chose pour Monk.
Mais avec un meurtre, pas de mise
en liberté sous caution pour Chris,
et ce sera sûrement pareil pour toi.
Les documents de l'accusation
te décrive comme le conspirateur.
Je me suis jamais approché
de la drogue !
La déclaration sous serment dit
qu'une source d'information...
Foutaises...
La source d'information dit
que vous communiquiez entre vous
en transférant des photos
sur les cellulaires. C'était un code.
Personne connaît le code
à part Chris, Monk et Cheese...
Et on est tous derrière les barreaux.
Personne d'autre a un cellulaire.
Pas même Snoop.
- Personne sauf les fournisseurs.
- Tu leur fais confiance ?
Quelqu'un savait
et quelqu'un leur a dit.
Maintenant ils ont vos cellulaires,
et ils vont faire appel au Titre III.
Ils avaient nos cellulaires sur...
Non, la source leur a donné
la date du ravitaillement.
Ils ont suivi Monk et les autres
à l'entrepôt, ils l'ont vu sortir,
et ils ont trouvé la drogue.
Ils obtiendront le mandat
et en examinant le cellulaire de Monk,
le tien et celui des autres, ils prouveront
l'association de malfaiteurs.
Tu vois ? Pas d'écoute,
mais maintenant ils utilisent
les cellulaires et les photos
pour relier le tout.
Qui savait pour le ravitaillement ?
Qui était au courant de tout ?
- Snoop.
- Et tu lui fais confiance ?
Qui d'autre ?
Délinquants sexuels, district sud.
Trois possibilités.
- On les surveille ?
- Un ou deux jours. Oui.
- Si ça donne rien, on passe...
- OK.
Mort et sans-abri.
Rue Jack dans Brooklyn.
Christeson est sur place.
- Étranglé ?
- On dirait plus un passage à tabac.
- Ruban rouge sur le poignet ?
- Plutôt terre sienne
et autour de sa bite.
Qu'est-ce que j'en sais ? Vas-y.
Jay, on dirait pas...
Une perte de temps, hein ?
Ce que vous avez vu aujourd'hui
montre bien les progrès que font
les écoles sous l'administration actuelle.
Je sais que le gouverneur
n'a pas été tendre
sur les écoles de Baltimore,
mais je trouve ça mal placé et décevant.
Une hausse de 15 points pour les examens
de 3e année, ce n'est pas rien.
Mais nous avons déjà vu
de telles hausses, monsieur le maire.
Et ces hausses ne semblent pas
se maintenir
dans les résultats
des 5e et 7 e années.
Kathy, on s'est engagé
à faire changer Baltimore.
Les jeunes que vous avez vus
aujourd'hui aux débats...
Ils ont le niveau du secondaire.
Ils démentent les stéréotypes négatifs
qu'on a sur nos écoles.
Vous voulez bien m'excuser une minute ?
- Major Colvin.
- Simplement Colvin.
Je voulais vous dire que je suis désolé
de la manière dont les choses ont tourné.
Je n'ai rien pu faire pour vous,
dans le district Ouest.
Personne n'aurait rien pu faire.
Eh bien, monsieur le maire...
Il n'y a rien à faire.
M. C, vous connaissez aussi le maire ?
Mince alors.
J'arrive pas à croire
que je te parle encore, Gus.
Après ce que tu m'as fait.
C'est comme ça que vous faites.
Vous descendez quelqu'un, puis revenez
comme si de rien n'était.
C'est le travail, Nerese.
C'était à ton tour de lire à ton sujet.
Si Carcetti devient gouverneur
et toi, maire...
Bond se présente contre toi ?
Ou il est fini ?
- À ton avis ?
- Après la farce avec Clay Davis...
Il m'a tout l'air d'être fini.
- Il paraît que Keiffer veut le poste aussi.
- Je verrai au moment venu.
Et ce gars, Daniels ?
Il est prêt à diriger la police ?
C'est pas joli ce petit coup bas
contre Burrell...
Je me demande bien
d'où vous avez sorti ça.
Que veux-tu dire ?
J'étais derrière Burrell
jusqu'à la fin.
Et si quelqu'un lui préparait un sale coup
à l'hôtel de ville...
je l'aurais su.
Daniels n'était même pas
sur mon radar.
Il a pas descendu Burrell ?
Après que son nom ait été cité,
Daniels ne voulait même plus le poste.
Raconte-moi tout.
Il a été pas mal amoché,
mais il a aussi des marques au cou,
on a peut-être essayé de l'étrangler.
- Pas de ruban ?
- Non.
- Des morsures ?
- Pas à ce que je sache.
- Ce gars pue.
- Il a sûrement évacué.
- Quoi ? Il est parti et il est revenu ?
- Non, il s'est chié dessus.
Ce n'est pas mon gars.
Désolé.
Il est tout à toi.
Le gouverneur pense-t-il
que c'est un problème qu'il faut régler ?
Un instant.
T'as l'état de service des Marines ?
Au moins trois semaines, ils ont dit.
Excusez-moi.
Steven, j'ai un petit problème.
C'est courant
chez les hommes de ton âge.
Je dois entrer à Walter Reed,
pour parler à un vétéran là-bas.
Le gars qui était avec notre sans-abri
quand il a vu les échanges de coups de feu.
Celui sur lequel Templeton écrivait.
- Pourquoi remuer tout ça ?
- Je veux juste lui parler.
Le sans-abri m'a filé son nom,
c'est un patient là-bas.
Après tout ce que le Post
a raconté sur Walter Reed ?
Si tu leur dis que tu es journaliste,
tu es mort.
Je sais, mais tu connais
quelqu'un là-bas, non ?
Pas à l'hôpital.
Ma voisine fait partie du AW2.
- Quoi ?
- Un programme des blessés de guerre.
Elle te fera rentrer,
si tu écris pas d'article.
- J'en écris pas.
- Que fais-tu alors, Gus ?
Quelque chose me démange.
- Les petites fêtes du service me manquent.
- C'est pas vrai.
T'es à toutes les fêtes.
Sacré coup de filet
avec Marlo Stanfield.
C'était mon numéro, hein ? Ça sent
l'écoute à la Lester Freamon.
J'ai vu les nouvelles,
toute cette drogue !
Je te jure, Carv, je bandais.
Ta bite s'est durcie ?
Comment le sais-tu ?
Parce que le bout ressortait
derrière ta tête.
Sérieusement, c'était des écoutes ?
Sérieusement,
je pourrais pas te le dire, Herc.
Que veux-tu dire ?
Le numéro était pas bidon ?
Que veux-tu que je dise, Herc ?
Tu es un as.
Sans ta petite contribution,
toute la ville aurait glissé
dans la baie de Chesapeake.
Tu préfères ?
Tu as grandi par ici ?
Ta famille est arrivée
à Baltimore quand ?
Reginald. Tu es en bas ?
- Oui.
- Viens dans l'escalier.
Je t'ai acheté des petites choses.
Du savon, du déo,
des trucs de ce genre.
Merci. J'utilise le lavabo
pour me laver.
Et pour pisser.
T'inquiète pas, je le rince.
Au fait... j'ai cet anniversaire
à mon groupe.
La famille peut venir
pour montrer son soutien.
Je me demandais si tu pouvais venir...
C'est difficile pour moi de prévoir
avec mon emploi du temps à l'hôpital.
On pourrait fêter ça après.
Je pourrais nous cuisiner un souper.
Rien de bien compliqué,
des macaronis au fromage,
mais tu verras, ce sera un délice.
On verra.
D'accord.
Ma sœur.
C'est une femme bien.
Elle a pas eu la vie facile, tu sais ?
- Levy.
- Pardon ?
- Levy. L'avocat.
- Je sais qui c'est.
Je cherche pas d'avocat.
Je retrace l'argent.
Suis les avocats.
Levy, Bronfman, Silverstein, Cray...
Tous ces gars qui prennent
les grandes affaires de drogue.
Ils se font pas de l'argent
qu'avec les honoraires.
- Comment...
- Les avocats ?
Ils tracent un chemin
pour tout cet argent de la rue.
Ils montrent à tous ces malfrats comment
l'envoyer à l'étranger, le récupérer,
l'investir.
C'est eux que ces petits sots
des ghettos écoutent
quand il s'agit d'argent.
Et Levy se fait bien graisser la patte.
Levy fait passer l'argent par qui ?
Quiconque a un projet ou autre
et a besoin d'argent.
Des développeurs, des gens qui veulent
capitaliser, des élus comme moi.
Beaucoup de gens ont besoin
d'un dollar de temps en temps...
Et les avocats touchent une part.
Des deux côtés, mais je dois dire,
il vous laisse profiter de son client
jusqu'à un certain point.
Une fois que vous avez un Barksdale
ou un Joe Stewart dans le système,
vous avez envie d'y aller à fond.
Levy vous laissera y goûter,
mais il vous lâchera pas.
Une fois que vous avez passé les avocats,
vous pouvez vraiment les pomper.
Une fois, j'ai réussi
à mettre un gars appelé Bell
sur ce projet
de condo sur la rue Howard.
Je me suis assuré
qu'il passe pas par l'avocat...
Bon Dieu,
on l'a fait saigner ce salaud...
Les avocats, hein ?
Absolument, détective.
Moi ?
Je ne suis qu'une petite bière.
Un simple homme politique
de Walbrook Junction,
essayant de faire son chemin
entre ce monde et le suivant.
Que pouvez-vous me dire d'autre
sur Levy ?
Rien de plus.
Je suis pas dans ces combines.
- Je prends ce qu'il me donne.
- Foutaises.
Donnez-moi quelque chose
ou je vais voir le procureur général.
Vous êtes
qu'un sale petit maître chanteur.
Écoutez ça...
Levy a quelqu'un
au palais de justice.
Et comment !
Levy achète des documents et les revend
à qui veut les voir avant tout le monde.
Croyez-moi,
il y a beaucoup d'argent en jeu.
- Un procureur ?
- J'ai pas de nom.
Sincèrement. Enfin,
si vous commencez à regarder
qui traîne autour du grand jury,
vous verrez que j'ai raison.
Je sais que j'en ai assez dit
pour racheter mon affaire.
Vous savez, vous pourriez payer
la tournée aussi.
Centre médical militaire
Walter Reed
Je t'ai fait mal ?
Non, ça fait du bien, Hubert.
Fais ce que tu as à faire.
Vous admirez ma main, chef ?
Appelez-moi Gus.
Difficile de perdre les habitudes.
- C'est plutôt réaliste.
- Oui.
Prothèse de la main.
Cinq doigts contrôlés individuellement.
Je peux pincer...
Fermer le poing...
Toucher le bout du doigt...
Et je peux pointer du doigt.
Les nouveaux modèles ont un pouce
qui tourne, ça fait toute la différence.
Avant, on pouvait que faire ça,
pour tout.
- Vous avez...
- Pas encore.
- On arrête pas le progrès.
- Ouais.
Ça vous ennuie si... ?
La femme du AW2 m'a dit
que vous écriviez pas d'article.
Non, je vérifie juste des détails
sur celui qu'on a déjà publié.
Un portrait de votre copain.
Terry.
Il vient me rendre visite
toutes les deux semaines.
Il prend le bus Peter Pan
à Baltimore.
Marche 3 kilomètres sur Georgia Avenue
depuis la gare de Silver Spring.
Il a quelques problèmes
comme vous le savez.
Vous avez lu l'article ?
Oui. Celui qui l'a écrit
a dit certaines choses de vraies.
Terry était en colère,
j'ai tenté de dédramatiser,
de le calmer.
Qu'est-ce qui était faux
dans l'article ?
On était loin de l'histoire
du faucon noir ce jour-là.
Quand les choses se sont gâtées...
Après que j'ai perdu mes mains...
ces salauds d'Habudabi
n'étaient même plus là après l'explosion.
C'est comme ça qu'ils font.
- Ça va, p'tit marin ?
- La forme.
J'ai une question.
Terry aurait-il pu exagérer les faits ?
Pourquoi pas ?
S'il avait été énervé par...
Quand on ment sur les combats,
c'est qu'on y était pas.
Et Terry y était. Deux fois.
Il peut vous raconter des histoires.
Mais pas sur ce jour-là.
Il a pas menti, c'est vous.
Désolé.
Kima, qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?
Tu as eu tort de laisser McNulty
prendre tes hommes pour son affaire.
Pourquoi ?
Où est le problème ?
Leurs heures, leurs rapports.
McNulty s'occupe de tout, hein ?
Et alors ?
Ils ont fait du travail de policier.
Et un méchant bon travail
de policier.
Tes gars...
Prépare-les bien, Ellis.
Lorsque l'I. I.D. Viendra les interroger,
qu'ils disent bien
qu'ils étaient au courant de rien,
qu'ils suivaient des ordres,
rendaient des fiches d'heures
et qu'ils ignoraient ce qui était envoyé
pour être approuvé.
Ils ignoraient quoi ?
Quand tu as dénoncé Colicchio
comment tu t'es senti ?
- Comme de la merde.
- Est-ce que tu vis avec ?
J'étais obligé.
Tony avait pété un câble.
Est-ce que tu vis avec ?
...Q Jams. Plus de hip-hop et de R'n'B.
Je suis Neke avec vous...
Nos amis sont dans la rue...
Ils sont gros, grands et magnifiques.
Ça va, Porkchop ?
Ça va, Neke, ici Porkchop...
On fait qu'attendre ?
Je devrais couper le moteur.
Avec le prix de l'essence...
- Tu peux y aller.
- On va où ?
Tu peux me laisser la voiture,
je veux dire.
Tu loues à la nuit, non ?
Je vois pas de moyen de négociation.
Quand tu as fini, laisse mon auto
dans la rue où je t'ai ramassé.
Oh, mon Dieu.
Regardez-moi ça.
- Bubs.
- Walon, mon gars...
Voici mon gars Fletcher.
Un journaliste qui me suit partout.
Tu es le bienvenu ici. Mais je te demanderai
de respecter notre vie privée.
Pas de prise de notes ni rien.
Ce que tu entends, reste dans la pièce.
Pas de problème.
Je suis venu pour Reginald.
Je suis son parrain et j'ai jamais réussi
à lui faire cracher son vrai nom.
- Reginald. Pas mal.
- T'as vu ce que tu as fait ?
- Quoi ?
- Allez.
Je m'appelle...
Je m'appelle...
Reginald.
- Mais on m'appelle Bubbles.
- Hey, Bubbles.
Je suis un toxicomane.
Je fête mon anniversaire.
Ma famille a pas pu venir ce soir.
J'ai laissé une traînée de feu
derrière moi.
Avec le temps, ils accepteront.
C'est vrai.
Tout comme pour moi, j'ai accepté.
Il y a deux jours, je suis allé me promener
dans le parc Druid Hill,
juste au coucher du soleil.
Vous connaissez ce moment de la journée,
avec ce jeu d'ombres et tout.
J'ai repensé à quand j'étais jeune,
assis dans ce parc.
Je regardais les filles, fumais de l'herbe
et buvais une bière fraîche.
Vous savez où je veux en venir.
J'ai eu ce moment où,
j'avais envie de ressentir tout ça.
Je me suis souvenu du conseil:
"Si tu as une envie, appelle
une personne du groupe et parle".
J'ai d'abord appelé Walon,
puisqu'il est mon parrain.
Il était justement parti en balade
avec son club de moto.
J'ai sorti la feuille
qu'ils avaient distribuée...
J'ai fait plusieurs numéros,
personne n'a répondu.
J'ai laissé des messages,
personne n'a rappelé !
Tu m'as pas appelée. Sinon moi,
je t'aurais rappelé Reginald.
Tu peux me croire.
Merci.
Bref...
je me suis pas shooté.
Je savais que si je le faisais, j'aurais
pas cette récompense dont je rêvais tant.
C'est vrai.
Ça m'a fait penser à un ami...
Il s'appelait Sherrod.
Je porte son deuil
depuis un bout de temps.
C'est comme ces souvenirs d'été
dans le parc...
J'ai souri en y pensant.
Avec Sherrod, ça fait mal.
Mais pas...
Pas autant qu'avant.
Faut pas avoir honte
de pleurer quelqu'un.
Du moment qu'il vous reste
de la place pour autre chose.
C'est bon.
Merci de m'avoir écouté.
- De m'avoir laissé parler.
- Merci d'avoir parlé.
Où est mon flingue ?
À la planque. Tu l'auras
quand on sera prêt.
Un détective veut vous voir.
Elle s'appelle Greggs, je crois.
Quoi ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Comment vous savez que Walter
y est pour quelque chose ?
Vous vous êtes même pas demandé
s'il méritait de mourir ?
Ce n'est pas une question de s'il le mérite
ou pas. C'est son heure, c'est tout.
Yo, gare-toi dans cette ruelle.
Faut que je pisse.
T'as qu'à pisser
dans le gobelet par terre.
Il m'en faudrait 10 au moins.
Gare-toi, Snoop.
Bon, alors ?
T'es timide ou quoi ?
T'es futé. Tu l'as toujours été.
Comment t'as deviné ?
Vous me l'avez appris.
Toujours être en avance.
Pourquoi ?
Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait de mal ?
Chris est enfermé
à cause de toi.
- T'es de mèche avec la police.
- J'ai pas dit un mot.
C'est ce que tu dis,
mais c'est dans ta façon d'être.
Toujours à part, à poser des questions
au lieu de suivre les ordres.
T'as jamais été un des nôtres.
T'aurais jamais pu.
Je suis bien coiffée, Mike ?
T'es bien.
Ils disent tous
que toutes les heures sup
ont servi
pour cette histoire de sans-abri.
- C'est ce qu'ils disent.
- Aucune écoute ?
J'ai demandé.
Je crois comprendre, rien d'officiel,
que c'était une écoute.
Ça semble logique,
Lester travaille comme ça.
Il trouve un numéro
et le travaille à mort.
Où il a eu le numéro, j'en sais rien...
Mais une écoute, ça représente des heures.
Et personne ne se fait payer...
Ce service fout encore plus
le camp qu'avant.
T'étais où, Mike ?
Faut que tu vois ça. Un tueur en
série, qui tue que des tueurs en série...
- Yo, yo. On part.
- T'as pas de fouet !
Prenez vos affaires.
Allez, faut se dépêcher.
- Allez. On y va !
- D'accord.
Mais ça veut dire...
Tous les appels aux journaux...
Les photos de l'homme porté disparu.
- On a autorisé des écoutes. McNulty...
- Sur un cellulaire.
Seigneur.
- Il n'oserait pas.
- C'est quoi le numéro ?
C'est dans le dossier...
- Viens.
- Où...
Contrôle des preuves.
Je croyais que tu délirais quand tu disais
que tu avais une tante ici.
Elle l'attend.
Avec ce qu'il y a dans la boîte.
C'est joli ici, hein ?
Allons-y, Bug.
J'aimerais bien aller avec toi.
Tu vas avoir ta propre chambre.
Elle a sûrement une de ces télé plasma.
Ce genre de baraque en jette.
Allons-y.
Bon, donne ça à tante Carla.
Dis-lui qu'il y en a plus
si elle en a besoin.
D'accord ?
Assure-toi qu'elle te rhabille.
T'as pas envie d'aller
dans une nouvelle école l'air d'un...
Allez.
Un homme pleure pas.
Vas-y, Bug.
Rapportez-le-moi pour que je le scelle
quand vous aurez fini, merci.
Merci, Augie.
- Content que vous vous en soyez sorti.
- Ouais.
Mieux que le travail.
Pourquoi ici ?
Pourquoi tu veux te mêler
à ce genre de milieu ?
Ils me donnent du travail.
Tu sais à qui tu parles ?
Je sais ce qu'ils font là-dedans, Duke.
Et puis, je pourrai toujours
traîner avec toi.
C'est trop risqué.
Tu te souviens de ce jour,
l'été dernier ?
Quand on a jeté des ballons
pleins de pisse sur les gars.
Tu te souviens ?
C'était juste avant la rentrée...
Je me suis fait méchamment tabasser,
mais c'est même pas grave.
Quelle journée...
Tu m'as acheté une crème glacée
dans la rue.
Tu t'en souviens, Mike ?
Non.
À bientôt, Mike.
À bientôt, Duke.
Canadian French
2316.
Yeah, lester.
- Where are you at?
- On monk in east baltimore.
- Who's on Marlo?
- No one right now.
- Marlo's been the
hardest to follow.
Too paranoid.
Too much counter-surveillance.
Well, peel off monk
and head out broening highway
to the marine terminals.
Map forty-four,
grid g-as-in-george-ten.
- Forty-four.
- Affirmative.
This is a fresh one.
- If they're going all
the way out there,
then it might just be...
- Damn right.
On it.
Twenty-three-oh-six to
all units on this detail.
New twenty is map forty-four,
grid g-george-ten.
That's forty-four g-george-ten.
Flood that grid and look
for suspect vehicles.
- Twenty-three-twelve.
Ten-four.
Take me a while.
I'm up northeast. You want
me to stay on cheese?
- Negative. New twenty
is a priority.
Think we're on the main stem.
- Yeah?
- Mcnulty? It's on.
- Yeah?
- Oh, hell yeah.
Alright...
[telephone
"Deserve got nuthin' to do with it."
- Snoop.
okay, whatchya got?
- Well, we rolled around until
bobby spotted chris partlow
pulled up on a lot two
blocks from here.
So we sat on him until
Marlo posted.
They talked for a minute,
then Marlo bounced.
And chris goes to the
warehouse gate alone
and a cola white boys
open up.
He's inside now?
- Entrance is around front
from what I can tell,
it's the only working gate.
Everything else is rusted up.
- Who's watching the front?
- Two units.
They're out on foot,
a block away,
with a clear view of what
comes in or out.
- So what do we do
if chris rolls out?
- Let him go.
Partlow is muscle.
He's here to make sure
it looks right.
And if it does, monk or
someone else'll come on down.
Cheese, too, maybe.
So this is a re-up.
Fuck a re-up, son.
This, here, in the
middle of nowhere...
Miles from anywhere
these mopes meet...
This is re-supply.
Other than chris, anybody
else that goes in there...
If it's a Stanfield lieutenant
he's coming out dirty.
You follow them back to town.
If he doesn't know you're
on 'em, see where
he takes you.
If he catches a scent, fuck it.
Pull 'em over, jack
'em up and get the dope.
And leander, you want to
snatch the man's cell
before he has a chance to erase
anything that might be on it.
The case is in t phones...
Though we're
gonna need a title three
to take
a look at them.
Where are you going?
Time to 'fess up.
We straight?
I said we straight, right?
Them guns was mine.
- Which guns specifically,
mr. Hill?
- Whatever guns them cops took
out the truck last year.
They mine.
Even though I ain't
touched that iron.
Ain't you got
to do the bit.
- With your limited priors, mr.
Hill, you're exposed to two,
maybe three years, tops.
You'll be well compensated
for the time, I'm sure.
No good to us no how.
You on three legs.
- Familiarize yourself
with the make and model
of the weapons you
left in the truck, Mr. Hill.
The details matter.
- I get shot up
an' then this shit.
Y'all ask a lot, dontcha?
- You can't hack, go down
walmart or someshit.
And see if they take care you
while you laid up for a while.
C'mon, nigga.
- Jeez. In the department,
you take one in the line
they give you light duty
for as long as you need,
then you get to name
your next assignment.
Marlo runs a tighter ship.
Open it.
Six icebox, twenty each.
You count, we wait.
You no count,
we go to lunch early.
- Twenty-three fourteen
to twenty-three-oh-six.
Suspect number three is in.
You sure it was him?
- Been following the
damn truck for a week.
Shouldnow by now.
Copy that.
- Truck. Ticks
have six legs or eight?
- Must have
been a readjustment.
- London was a sweet posting.
I can't lie.
My only regret is I didn't
get the full three-year tour.
Thanks.
- It's no reflection
on you, man.
- Shit, gus, they even sold
the building in kensington.
I mean we bought that sucker
for nothing fifty years ago,
and now chicago sells it off
for a couple million pounds.
- Capitalization they
call it.
- These newspaper-chain
guys
just don't give a fuck,
do they?
- Any idea where they're
gonna drop you now that
you're back in charm city?
No, I got no idea yet.
Klebanow wants to
have lunch, so I guess it'll
come at me, soon enough.
Up for something now?
Depends.
- I gotta problem.
I need someone...
A veteran reporter, quiet,
subtle, discreet.
Good with details,
careful to cover his tracks...
- I don't care
how far we go back, gus,
no way I'm gonna
kill your wife for you.
- You know scott templeton?
City g.a.
- The guy talking to the
homeless killer?
Not really.
He got hired
after I went to london.
- It's better
you don't know him.
No opinions,
one way or the other.
No, no,
i'm not saying anything.
I'm not. I just need
fresh eyes on the fella.
Just a careful look.
- One of whiting's pets,
isn't he?
I said discreet, huh?
I hope you're wrong.
'course you do.
It sticks. Dag.
- Course it sticks.
It's barb wire.
Sticking's what
it's s'posed to do.
Come on.
I ain't got all day.
Hurry up now.
Grab the aluminum
strips there first off.
Grab the aluminum
strips there first off.
- How am I supposed
to get back over?
Climb the damn fence.
Do a better job of
it second time, I expect.
Grab them steel pipes quick,
before we get spotted.
Robert ruby.
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.
I need you to give me
a global printout
on everything under scott
templeton's byline.
All of it, every edition.
Hey, I'm a fan.
Twenty-three-fourteen.
Monk is westbound
onto o'donnell.
Cheese wagstaff
is on the way in.
Also, there's
a truck leaving.
The one we saw
back on the loading dock.
That'd be empty.
They've offloaded,
it's all in the warehouse now.
Bobby and me
will stay on monk.
Karen'll follow cheese out,
you guys stay
on the gate.
Forgetting for a moment
our little problem
of the serial killer,
we came in promising
a double-digit drop
in violent crime.
Right up on the
gubernatorial primary,
and we're looking
at another record high.
- Michael, this department
has been crippled
by the budget cuts.
For a year now,
we haven't had
the manpower or the tools.
You have them now.
- Now. But this
thing is a ship,
a super-tanker.
We can't just
turn it around...
Like that.
More foot patrols.
More cars on the street.
Get a handle on it, dammit.
See that's
what doesn't work.
More cops where
people can see them.
More cops on the pavement,
more cops riding past,
more cops showing the flag
so that you guys can say
you're being tough on crime.
Respectfully, sir,
what works
is committing to building
a real deterrent.
We take the time to retool,
to teach our people
not to chase stats,
but to do actual
police work.
- Who pulled your string,
deputy?
I was told by our mayor
at the outset that there
would be no more band-aids,
no more stat games...
- And then we got hit
with the school budget.
And we lost some of the time
we needed to address
the systemic things
you're talking about.
Understood. We will
work back on those,
and we will
support that kinof reform,
if not from city hall
then from annapolis,
if need be.
But now, deputy, right now,
my boss needs the crime
to go down.
Not three years from now.
Not even a year from now.
He needs a ten-percent drop
in the next quarter...
Or no one
is gonna be in a position
to reform anything.
Be creative, gentlemen.
Deputy.
A detective's outside
for you,
says it's urgent.
- Sydnor and I developed
a source
and ran fressurveillances
on Marlo Stanfield.
And we believe we're
about to catch
his people very dirty.
What?
- We wrapped on that
clay davis
thing and instead of
shutting major crimes down,
we took a couple weeks and
got back up on Marlo.
With the right warrants,
he's about to fall.
How the fuck...
- There's no time, cedric.
In an hour or so,
i'm gonna need...
Yeah?
- Lester...
- What's up?
- We pulled up monk.
Dirty as a motherfucker.
Eight keys of the raw.
No, he jersey-rolled a stop and
when we tried to pull him over,
he went rabbit on us.
We ran him down on lafayette,
by the overpass.
You got the phone, right?
Yeah, man. I got it.
Good work.
It's down.
I need teams to arrest
Marlo Stanfield,
chris partlow,
and cheese wagstaff.
I also need someone
from our s.a.o.
To get on the horn to baltimore
county for an s-and-s
warrant on a middle
river warehouse.
And, oh yeah...
Bunk meland
has a warrant on partlow
for a separate homicide.
He held that back so we could
do this business here.
- Anything else you've neglected
to tell me, detective Freamon?
No sir.
I think you're caught up.
- Hello?
- Ronnie, dear.
Hey...
- Are you sitting down?
- Why?
- He was trying to erase
shit when we tackled him.
Secure this location
until we have written
search-and-seizure.
Shit's on t.v, yo.
- With a street value
of almost sixteen
million dollars in heroin,
and charges against high-level
traffickers who were
going to put this poison on
the streets of this city...
- Do this mean I still gotta
take that charge for y'all?
...and perseverance by our
police department.
And while I am told that this
investigation is continuing,
it is my understanding that
there is at least one murder
warrant associated with this
drug organization,
which is believed to have
been responsible for
many of those bodies found
in vacant rowhouses
more than a year ago.
We did not give up on that
investigation
just as we do not give up
trying every day to
address ourselves to the
task of making this city safe
and vibrant again.
And let me just say to all
others responsible
for the drug trade's assault
on the welfare of this city,
a day like this is
coming for you.
Oh, you are so butch.
- I have seen what drugs have
done to baltimore.
Drug dealers do not just
destroy individuals.
They destroy families.
- Don't forget about the
communities.
- They destroy entire
communities.
Today the mayor of baltimore,
our state's attorney,
our police department, and
our communities are saying:
we... Have had... Enough.
Thank you.
Deputy.
Alma gutierrez, "sun" papers.
Care to comment?
- It's a good day
for the good guys.
- Could you be a bit
more substantive?
Last time the "sun"
had me in its pages,
you had me doing
things I didn't do.
Regarding?
- Something about me stabbing
someone in the back.
Look it up.
"a source of information
"identified the transmission
of photographs
via cellphone."
Fuck do that mean?
"source of information."
They sayin' somebody talkin'?
Who the fuck even know?
I wanna talk to the lawyer.
And you caught a murder,
too.
says the same shit
on yours, huh?
"from information received,
investigation led to d.n.a.
Analysis of the victim."
They got you on d.n.a.?
My hair, I expect.
- "From information received."
More of that snitchin' shit.
- I'm sayin',
where the information come from?
Onliest people knew 'bout
the deed is us right here.
Snoop knew.
Shit.
- What about your
youngun michael?
Maybe it was him ran his mouth.
He got picked up, right?
I did that thing for him.
Why would he talk about it an'
put hisself in?
- He been tested
on the streets.
Maybe he act different
in the rooms downtown.
- Boy been throwin' up all
kinda backtalk 'bout shit.
Buck' wild about this 'n that.
Like what?
- Cryin' about how june bug
and his people got lit up.
Cryin' about how omar in the
street runnin' his mouth,
callin' for you to step to...
Omar say what?
Nuthin'.
Omar tried callin'
you out by name.
But, shit, it wadn't nothin'...
What he say about me?
- Nuthin', man.
Just talkin' shit.
He use my name?
In the street?
Talk, motherfucker.
He just, ya know...
Say that you need to
step to and that...
I dunno, he just runnin'
his mouth some.
He call me a punk?
It was bullshit, man.
You ain't need
that on your mind.
- What the fuck you
know about
what I need on my mind,
motherfucker.
My name was on the street.
When we bounce from
this shit here,
y'all gonna go down
to them corners,
let them people know.
Word did not
get back to me.
Let 'em know Marlo
step to any motherfucker.
Omar, barksdale...
Whoever.
My name is my name.
Don't see the boy snitchin'.
Neither do i.
But you ready to bet
your future on that?
- Ya see that, mcnulty?
Ya see it?
One detective,
working the file,
running a few things
down and bang...
He's got an arrest.
Shit, now that chris partlow's
locked up
we might have some
witnesses coming forward
on those cases in
the vacants.
Clear 'em all on paper.
- We got the one
is all, boss.
- One today, more tomorrow.
And from what?
- From the bunk
just workin' a file.
Business as usual.
But you...
With your
overtime and your cars
and your
surveillance detail
and your bullshit,
where the fuck are
you on your redball?
Nowhere.
Killer stopped calling.
Stopped killing, too.
I admit it.
I'm nowhere.
- From everything
we've given you,
fire should be
shooting out your ass,
but no, there you sit
like a genital wart.
C'mon, mcnulty.
Show me something.
- So what are you
gonna do now?
Keep half a district worth
of manpower on the street,
chasing bullshit?
It'll wind down.
No more killing,
no more disappearances,
no more calls.
Marlo is in cuffs.
Fuck Marlo.
Fuck you.
- What's going on in
klebanow's office?
Planning meeting.
Pulitzer submissions.
This early?
- The important thing is
that we build on this
through the end of the year,
with no falloff of coverage.
Exactly.
And scott,
we need to start looking
for the points where the
response to the problem
can be criticized.
The "gotcha." I know.
- At this point,
we can't tell what category
we'll enter with this,
but in public service
especially,
greater weight is given
to stories
that result in
changes to policy,
or new legislation.
- So covering the reactions
to our stories
is as important as
the stories themselves.
- Between now and new year's,
we want to a hammer
at whatever changes
or discussions
or actions result from your
coverage of the homeless.
- And graphics matter.
Our presentation must be
clean and professional when it
goes to the committee.
- You guys really think this
has a shot at a pulitzer?
I do and it does.
Being on the pulitzer board
for a coup of terms,
I've seen the process up close.
There's a way of
doing these things.
Time honored.
Knowing how is why they
pay me the big bucks.
- Alright. What do we
want to say exactly?
With our coverage.
What do we want to say
about homelessness?
I mean, it's bad.
It's very bad, granted.
Buisn't it actually
symptomatic of a much
greater dynamic...
- We want to rediscover
a world
that for too long
has been ignored.
Examine the tragedy
underlying these murders,
the neglect...
The dickensian aspect.
Exactly.
Alma, dearest.
This quote from daniels:
"it's a good day for
the good guys."
He couldn't come up with
anything better than that?
He wouldn't play.
Says we took his name in vain
last time we used it.
When was that?
- When we had him back-stabbing
burrell at city hall, remember?
Do you want me to call
daniels at home?
Try him again?
We're past deadline, gus.
I'll cut the quote.
Alright.
Drink with me, jimmy.
This is what you wanted, man.
- Then why do I feel
like shit?
Postpartum depression, son.
It's the journey,
not the destination...
We got Marlo Stanfield.
What about the serial killer?
Marlo is he.
Daniels wanted me up there
at that press conference.
Up there with all the rest of
those preening motherfuckers,
congratulating themselves
on a job well done.
Part of the problem,
all of them.
Yet when the bracelets come out
and the dope is on the table...
- We've still got
the surveillance teams.
The districts still have guys
watching the homeless,
undercovers dressed
as homeless...
That shit'll end.
It always does.
Well...
If you ain't gonna
celebrate with me,
you're gonna at least
chauffeur my drunken ass home.
Shardene better be awake, too.
'cause I do believe
lester Freamon's
in the mood for love...
- Yo, I'm tellin' you,
it was kenard.
To catch up with him.
Bullshit.
Omar got kilt by them
pimlico boys.
They ran up on him with three
a.k.s an' jus' blazed away.
What up, soldier?
- I don't know.
You tell me.
I mean, everybody locked up,
right?
I mean, damn...
Yeah. 'cause-a that shit,
i'm 'a need you for some
serious business tomorrow, man.
- Anyone I know?
- Big walter.
Big-nose big walter?
- Nah, skinny big walter,
the one be right there
in front of the
cut-rate on calhoun
and riggs all the time.
He witnessin'?
- Marlo say he need
to get got.
So it is, what it is.
You got a problem with that?
We straight.
No need to bring your iron.
I got a clean nine for you
with shaved numbers.
I'll pick you up tomorrow night.
You a-ight?
Yeah, yeah.
A-ight.
- And in the last five years,
the united states has
given fifteen billion dollars
to fight h.i.v. And aids
around the world.
But only part of it goes
to africa,
where there's a huge epidemic
of h.i.v. And aids.
I mean, ten percent of the
population of the world
lives in sub-saharan africa,
but seventy percent of
the new aids cases are there.
In ken,
one in seven people
have h.i.v. And aids,
and in zimbabwe,
one in four people have it,
according to the article in
the "new york human rights
law review."
Plus, the u.s. Surgeon
general has said that
there are twenty-two million
people with h.i.v. And aids
in those african countries.
In the next ten years,
more people will die from aids
in these countries than all the
wars in the twentieth century,
including world war two,
the deadliest war...
How's it feelin', bunny?
- I tell ya,
if I had that boy's
gift for talk,
i'd a really caused a stir.
Look at him go...
Don't sell yourself short.
He's got your way of makin'
an argument.
Lucky for him, though,
he looks like his stepmama.
- And aids in africa
said u.s. Money
can make a huge difference
in africa where even very small
amounts can go a long way.
There seems to be an agreement
that the money should be spent
in two ways: medical treatment
and for education and
prevention.
However, there is not an
agreement on how much money
will be needed and what
programs...
When do we bounce?
I'm working on bail reviews.
Cheese maybe...
On a high surety bond,
if he wants to put up
his mama's house.
Monk, the same.
But with the murder warrant,
there is no bail for chris,
and most likely,
there's no bail for you,
as the charging papers portray
you at the top
of the conspiracy.
- How can they say that when I
ain't go near no drugs at all?
- The full affidavit says
they developed
a source of information...
Bullshit.
- A source of information
who told them that
you communicated with
each other
using photographic transmissions
on cellphones.
Coded transmissions.
- Ain't nobody know
about the code 'cept me,
chris, monk an' cheese...
An' we all locked
up behind this.
No one else even have a phone.
Not even snoop.
No one 'cept the supply.
You trust the supplier?
Well, someone knew
and someone told.
And now they've got
your cellphones,
and they're going for
a title three.
- So they was on our
cell phones then...
- No, the affidavit says
the source told them
the date of your re-supply,
that they followed monk
and others to the warehouse,
followed him out,
and found the drugs.
They're going to get
their title three
and they're saying that by
examining monk's phone,
your phone, and the others,
they're going to prove
the conspiracy.
You see?
They weren't on a wiretap,
but now they're using
the phones and photographs
to link you all together.
So who knew that there
was a re-supply?
Who knew what you all were
up to yesterday?
Snoop.
D you trust her.
Who else?
- Known sex offenders,
southern district.
Three possibles.
- You want us to sit
on them?
A day or two. Yeah.
If nothing shows,
then we'll move on...
Okay.
Dead and homeless.
Jack street in brooklyn.
Christeson's down there.
Strangle?
- Sounds like a beating,
actually.
- Red-ribbon tied
around the wrist?
- Actually, it was more of
a burnt sienna and it
was lashed around his dick.
Fuck do I know?
Get down there.
- Jay, this doesn't
sound like...
Waste of your time, huh?
- That what you have seen
here today is indicative
of the progress that city
schools are making under
this current administration.
Now I know the governor has
had some harsh things to
say about baltimore schools,
but I find that to be cynical
and disappointing.
The fifteen-point jump in
third-grade test scores
is a trend that
can't be ignored.
- But we've seen third grade
scores rise before, Mr. Mayor.
And it doesn't seem as if any
gains in that grade can be
sustained into fifth and
seventh-grade scores.
- Kathy, you know,
we are committed to
substantive change in baltimore.
The kids that you saw today in
this citywide debate...
They are achieving at
a high school level and
disproving any negative
stereotypes about the city
school system.
Could you excuse me for
a moment, please?
Major colvin.
Just colvin.
- You know,
I always wanted to say
how sorry I am
how things turned out.
There wasn't anything that
I could have done
with your experiment
in the western district.
There wasn't anything
that anyone could have
done with that.
- Yeah, well, I guess,
mr. Mayor, um...
There's nothing to be done.
- Mr. C, you know
the mayor, too? Dag.
- I can't even believe
i'm talking to you, gus.
After that shit you pulled.
See that's how you all do.
Slam somebody an' then
come back the next day
like it never happened.
It's jus' bidness, nerese.
It was your turn to read
about yourself.
Now, if carcetti's governor
and you become mayor...
Is bond gonna run against ya?
Or is he done?
What do you think?
- After the clay
davis farce...
He smells like he's done to me.
There's rumor that keiffer
want the job, too.
- I'll deal with that
as it comes.
- What about this
daniels fella?
You think he's ready
to run the copshop?
It's kinda ugly the way
he kept puttin' a knife
to burrell like that.
I mean...
- You know I read that and
wondered where the hell
you people got it from.
What do you mean?
- I was behind burrell
until the moment I wasn't.
And if he had someone
backstabbing him
at city hall...
I'd've heard about it.
Daniels wasn't even
on my radar.
- Daniels didn't
undercut burrell?
- Shit, at the end,
after his name was floated,
daniels went around saying
he didn't want the job.
Talk about it.
- Well, he's been beat
pretty good,
but I've got neck bruising too,
so it could be
an attempted strangle.
- No ribbon?
- Nope.
- Bite marks?
- Not that I can see.
This fuckin' guy stinks.
He probably evacuated.
- What?
He left and he came back?
No, he shit himself.
It's not my guy.
Sorry, rook.
He's all yours.
- And does the governor
think that's a problem,
that it's something that
needs to be addressed?
Hold on a sec...
- You got the military records
back from the marine corps?
- Three weeks at least,
they said.
Sorry about that.
- Hey steven,
I gotta little problem.
- Well, it's common
in men your age.
- I need to get into
walter reed.
I gotta talk to
a vet down there.
The fella that was with
our homeless vet
when he saw that firefight.
The one templeton was
writing about.
- Why do we want to
go back on that?
- I just want to talk
to a guy.
Homeless fella gave me the name
said he's in-patient down there.
- Afr the "post" series
blew up walter reed's shit?
If you tell them you're
a journalist,
you're dead to them.
Yeah, I know.
You know somebody
down there, right?
Not at the hospital.
A neighbor of mine
is with a-w-two.
What?
- The army's wounded
warrior program.
She could get you in,
if you're not actually
writing a piece.
I'm not.
What are you doing, gus?
Scratching an itch.
- I do Miss the
shift-change parties.
No you don't.
You never missed a
fucking one of them.
- That was one sweet bust you
people put on Marlo Stanfield.
My number right?
I mean, it definitely
smells like a lester
Freamon wiretap.
I watched the news,
all that dope on the table.
I swear, carv,
I was fully erect.
- Your dick got hard?
How could you tell?
- 'Cause the head was
poppin' out of the back
of your neck.
Seriously, it was a
wiretap, right?
- Seriously, I couldn't fuckin'
tell you if I knew, herc.
- So what're you saying?
My phone number wasn't shit?
- Ah, what do you want me
to fuckin' say, herc?
You're the tits.
Without your little
contribution,
the whole fucking city
slips into the chesapeake bay.
Better?
So you grew up there?
Well, when did your family
move to baltimore?
- Reginald.
You down there?
yes.
Come to the steps.
Got a coupla things for you.
Soap, deodorant and the like.
- 'Preciate that.
Usin' the washer basin
to clean up.
And to pee in.
- Don't worry,
I rinse it out.
I was wonderin'...
I got this anniversary comin
up, at the meetin' place.
Sometimes kin folk
come along
to show support.
I was wonderin',
maybe you could...
- It's hard for me to make
plans with my schedule
at the hospital.
- We got a little
celebration after.
Thinkin' I could cook us
some dinner.
I mean wouldn't be
a fancy thing,
mac and cheese, like that,
but I guarantee it'll
be good to you.
We'll see.
Okay.
My sister.
She good people.
Been through a lot though,
you know?
Levy.
'scuse me?
Levy. The lawyer.
I know who he is.
I'm not looking for
any lawyers.
I'm following the money.
Follow the lawyers.
Levy, bronfman,
silverstein, cray...
All those guys who take
the high-end drug work.
They don't just make money
off the criminal fees.
- How's he...
- The lawyers?
They the ones who make
a path for all this
street-corner money.
They showin' all these
kingpin motherfuckers
how to sd it overseas,
bring it back,
invest the shit.
They the ones who
these ignorant ghetto
motherfuckers always
listen to when
it comes to cash money.
And levy, man,
he got the most grease.
- So levy routes
it through who?
- Anyone who got a project
or a game in need of cash.
Developers, people lookin'
to capitalize,
elected folk
like myself.
Shit, there's a lotta people
out here need a dollar
now an' then...
- And the lawyers
take their cut.
- On both ends,
though I got to say,
he gonna let you rob one
of his clients only so much.
I mean once you get
a barksdale or
a joe stewart on the hook,
you want to go deep
on they ass.
Levy'll let you get a taste,
but he won't let you run wild.
'cause once you get past these
motherfuckin' lawyers,
yocan really play the pimp.
This one time,
I had this fella named bell
hooked up on this howard
street condo thing,
got him so that he
wasn't runnin' his shit
past the lawyer...
Boy, I tell u,
we bled that mother fucker...
Lawyers, huh?
- Oh, most definitely,
detective.
me?
Shit, I'm just small potatoes.
Just a workin' politician
from walbrook junction,
tryin' to make his way
from this world into the next.
- What else can you
give me on levy?
- Nothin' other than
what I have.
I ain't up in his
business or nuthin'.
I just takin' what he throws.
Bullshit.
You got something
solid or I'm on my way
to the u.s. Attorney.
- You ain't nuthin'
but a shakedown artist.
How's this...
Levy got someoneat the courthous
oh, hell yeah.
Levy been buyin'
papers now for years
and sellin' 'em to
whoever needs an early look.
And don't think there ain't
no real money in that.
A prosecutor?
- I don't have a name.
Truly I don't,
but it seems to me,
you start lookin' at
the people hangin'
around the grand jury,
you'll find I'm right.
Now I know I've said
enough to buy my case back.
You know, you could
buy a round, too.
You know, you could
buy a round, too.
I get you?
Nah, feels good, hubert.
You dig in there,
you got a mind to.
You admiring my hand, si
oh, call me gus.
- It's hard to
get out the habit.
- That's pretty
damn lifelike.
Yeah.
Prosthetic digits.
Five of 'em,
individually controlled.
I got my key grip...
And my power grip...
My precision grip...
And my index point.
These new models got a
thumb that rotates,
which makes
all the difference.
Used to be you just had
this one grip,
right here for everything.
- You got your...
- Not yet.
- Brave new world.
- Yeah.
Do you mind if I...?
- The a-w-two lady says
you weren't writin' no story.
- No, I'm just verifying
details of one we already
printed in my newspaper.
Profile of your buddy.
- Terry.
- Hmm-hmm.
- Yeah, he come down
visit me every coupla weeks.
He takes that peter pan bus
down from baltimore.
Walks a couple of miles
down georgia avenue
from the silver
spring terminal.
He's having some
trouble as you know.
Did you read the article?
Yeah.
Man who wrote it got
some stuff right.
Terry was pissed,
I tried to play it off,
make him good with it.
- What did the story
get wrong?
- Well, that day wadn't
no black hawk down thing.
You know, when shit
went bad...
After I lost my hands,
them habudabi
motherfuckers weren't
even around after
the shit went off.
That's how they do.
How you doin', marino?
Outstanding.
Let me ask you this.
Could terry have exaggerated?
Why not?
If he got wound up say...
nah.
You lie about combat
because you weren't there.
And terry was.
Two tours.
He's got stories
if he wants 'em.
Just not on that day.
He ain't lie,
y'all did,
sorry t'say.
- Kima, what the fuck
are you taking about?
- I'm sayin' you made a
mistake letting mcnulty
run your people from one case
to the other like you did.
Why? What's the big deal?
- Their run sheets,
office reports.
Mcnulty covered them, right?
- So fuckin' what?
They did police work.
They did good fuckin'
police work, in fact.
Your guys...
You coach 'em good, ellis.
You let them know when
i.i.d. Comes callin'
that their answer is
that they didn't know
anything about it,
that they did what
they were told and they
turned in clean run sheets,
and they don't know
what anyone else sent
upstairs for staff review.
Know about what?
- When you spoke up
on colicchio...
How did that feel?
- Like shit.
You okay with it?
It was a forced move.
Tony lost it.
He was around the bend.
But are you okay with it?
Ninety-two q jams.
The most hip-hop and r & b.
It's your girl neke here...
We got our peoples
in the street.
They big, they fat,
and they gorgeous.
What up, porkchop?
- What's up, neke,
it's your boy porkchop...
We just gonna sit,
I should cut it.
With what they be chargin'
at the pump,
don't make sense to idle.
You can go.
Where to?
- Sayin' you can leave
the car with me.
You rent by the night, right?
- I ain't seen no
medium of exchange.
Look, when you done,
leave my short on the street
where I pick you up at.
Hmm-hmm.
- Oh, my god.
Look at this.
Bubs.
Walon, man...
This here's
my boy fletcher.
Newspaper writer
been followin' me 'round.
- Well, you're welcome
to sit in.
But I have to ask that
you respect the privacy.
No notetaking,
no recorders,
what you hear today
stays in the room.
- Not a problem.
I'm just here with reginald.
Reginald?
Reginald?
- I'm his fuckin' sponsor
and I don't believe
I ever got a christian
name out of him.
Reginald.
Hot shit.
See what you done?
What, man?
Come on.
My name is...
My name is...
Reginald.
Round the way
they call me bubbles.
Hey, bubbles.
I'm a drug addict.
Celebratin' my anniversary.
My people couldn't
make it here tonight.
I left a trail
of fire behind me.
Time gonna make it right
with them, I guess.
That's right, it will.
- Same thing get me
right with myself.
Couple a days ago,
I took a walk down
in druid hill park,
right wh the sun
was goin' down.
You know how that
time be like,
with the sun throwin'
shadows an' all.
Got me thinkin'
'bout when I was a young man,
sittin' in that park.
You know, watchin' the girls,
smokin' on a little herb,
drinkin' a cold beer.
You know where this is goin'.
I had this moment where,
you know,
I was wantin' to
feel that way again.
I remembered,
what y'all said,
if the urge was to come,
call a group member
up and talk.
First thing I called walon up,
him bein' my sponsor an' all,
turns out he's on a ride
with his motorcycle club.
So I pulled out that sheet
that got passed out...
Dialed a few numbers,
couldn't get an answer.
I left a coupla messages,
but nobody called me back.
You didn't call me.
'cause I would have got up
with you, reginald.
You can believe that.
Well, anyway...
I didn't get high.
See, I knew if I did
I wouldn't get that
good feelin' back that
I was daydreamin on.
- That's right.
That's right.
- It got me thinkin'
about a friend of mine...
Boy named sherrod.
I been carryin' his passin'
for a long while.
Like that memory I had
about those summer days
in the park.
Thinkin' on that make me smile.
With sherrod,
it's more of a hurt.
But not as...
Not so bad like it was.
Ain't no shame in holdin'
on to grief.
As long as you make room
for other things, too.
It's alright.
So thank you for listening.
Thank you for
lettin' me share.
Thanks for sharing.
Where my gun?
- In the trap.
You get it when we set up.
- A detective is here
to see you.
Greggs, I think she said.
What? What's the matter?
- How you all even know
if Walter behind everybody
gettin' jacked?
I mean, ain't you
all ever wonder
if he even deserve
any of this shit?
- Deserve got nuthin'
to do with it.
It's his time that's all.
- Yo, pull over in that
alley right there.
I gotta piss sumpin' fierce.
- You better piss in that
cup right there on the floor.
- Man, I'm gonna
need ten cups.
Yo, pull over, Snoop.
- What now, motherfucker?
You shy?
Smart nigga.
You always was.
How you know?
- Y'all taught me.
Get there early.
Why? What I do wrong?
- Chris locked up behind
somethin' he done for you.
You downtown with the police.
I ain't say a word.
Yeah, that's what you say.
But it's how
you carry yourself.
Always apart.
Always askin' "why"
when you should be doin'
what you told.
You was never one of us.
You never could be.
How my hair look, Mike?
You look good, girl.
- They're sayin' the
only o.t. That anyone
has been sing has been
through getting
detailed on the
homeless killings.
They say that's the case.
And no wiretaps up?
I asked about that.
And I'm hearing,
off-the-record kinda,
that it was a wire.
And it makes sense,
'cause that's how Lester works.
He gets hold of a number
and works it to death.
Ere he would get the
number I have no idea...
- But a wiretap is hours,
and you say no one
is making any money...
- Fuckin' department's
more fucked up than even
I remember it.
Where you been at, Mike?
You gotta see this.
There's a serial killer,
but he only be killin'
other serial killers...
- Yo, yo.
We about take a ride.
You ain't got no whip.
- Just gather your stuff,
both of y'all.
Come on, we gotta move quick.
Come on. Let's go!
Okay.
- But that means...
All the calls to
the newspaper.
The photographs
of the missing man.
We have a wiretap...
McNulty has a...
On a cellphone.
Jesus Christ.
He wouldn't dare.
What's the number?
It's on the paperwork...
Come on.
Where...
Evidence control.
- I always thought you
were bullshittin'
'bout havin'
an aunt out here.
She expectin' him.
An' what's in this box.
It's nice here, huh?
Let's go, bug.
Wish't I was going with you.
You gonna have your own room.
She probably got one of
them plasma t.V.'s, too.
Them joints is wet.
Let's go.
OK, give that to aunt Carla.
Tell her there's more behind
it when she finds the need.
A-ight?
Make sure she cop you
some fresh things, too.
I don't need you going
to a new school lookin' all...
Come on, now.
A man don't be sheddin'
no tears.
Go on, bug.
- Bring it up front for
re-seal when you're through,
would ya, sir?
Thanks, augie.
Augie...
Glad you landed okay.
Yeah.
Beats workin'.
Why here?
Why you wanna mix
with their kind, man?
They give me work.
Who you talkin to?
I know what they be doin'
in there, duke.
- I could still hang with you,
then.
You know I'm too hot.
- You remember that one day,
summer past?
When we threw them piss
balloons at them terrace boys.
You remember? Just before
school started up again...
Y'know, I took a beatdown
from them boys,
I don't even throw
a shadow on it.
That was a day...
Y'all bought me ice cream
off the truck.
You remember, Mike?
I don't.
See you 'round, Mike.
See you, Duke

Mais si on...
- Mais comment a-t-il pu...
- Nom de Dieu.
Ça signifie donc...
Personne n'a tué de sans-abri ?
Pas de tueur en série.
C'était des meurtres sans rapport,
ainsi que des décčs naturels maquillés,
aucunement liés entre eux.
- Pourquoi ?
- Pour financer une enquęte
visant les trafiquants responsables
des meurtres des maisons vacantes.
D'oů les arrestations et saisies
de la semaine derničre.
Donc, si j'ai bien compris...
Ça fait des semaines
que je descends le gouverneur
pour avoir négligé les sans-abri
et proclamé
que nous ferons tout
pour trouver ce tueur, alors que...
Norman,
je risque gros, lŕ !
Tout ŕ fait, chef.
Mais la situation
possčde un certain charme.
Ils ont fabriqué un problčme
pour ętre payés,
nous, pour te faire élire gouverneur.
Tout le monde voit son intéręt servi
avec ce simulacre.
Les fautifs seront suspendus,
puis renvoyés, au moins.
Au-delŕ,
des poursuites pour fraude et parjure
sont probables.
On convoque
une conférence de presse ?
"Au fait, l'histoire des sans-abri tués,
"le gouverneur
coupant le filet de protection,
"nous faisant tout notre possible
pour coincer le tueur,
- "on est les dindons de la farce."
- Sans oublier
que les preuves contre les trafiquants
arrętés sont entachées.
Cette affaire pourrait également
s'effondrer.
J'y crois pas, putain !
Vous deux ętes responsables !
Si ça se sait ŕ Annapolis,
le gouverneur va me massacrer.
Et si on en vient ŕ ça,
vous serez les premiers sacrifiés, juré.
Comment ça pourrait ne pas s'ébruiter
une fois les inspecteurs suspendus,
sans parler du passage
devant le grand jury ?
Les flics derričre tout ça,
ils doivent partir.
Ne me dites pas
que je dois vivre avec ça.
M. l'adjoint, Maître,
si vous voulez bien nous excuser,
nous allons en discuter d'abord
comme question d'intéręt public.
Jusqu'ŕ ce qu'on trouve
la meilleure approche,
ne faites rien
et n'en parlez ŕ personne.
Si le scandale éclate
ŕ notre désavantage,
des tas de gens
légalement responsables,
des gens bien,
exerçant néanmoins une supervision,
en souffriront.
Et personne ne souhaite ce dénouement.
Mike veut dire que nous devons ętre
prudents quant ŕ notre façon d'agir.
J'aimerais ętre encore au journal,
pour pouvoir écrire sur ce foutoir.
Ça dépasse l'entendement.

Lester. Quel bon vent t'amčne ?
Rien n'est prévu
pour toi aujourd'hui.
40 000 du Showboat sur la promenade.
26 au Borgata.
80, l'an passé, au Taj Mahal.
Et c'est juste les casinos
d'Atlantic City.
J'aime jouer. Et alors ?
Tu as perdu trois fois ton salaire
depuis deux ans.
J'ai examiné ton dossier de crédit.
Sept pages de droits de rétention
et une troisičme hypothčque
il y a deux mois.
Gary, tu es cuit.
- Comment ça ?
- On a retrouvé
des documents scellés du grand jury
chez des trafiquants.
Des personnes t'ont nommé.
Tu es dans le pétrin, Gary.
Mais tu as des amis ici,
de vieux amis.
Avoue ta faute,
donne les noms
de ceux qui t'ont acheté.
Radié ?
Sans le moindre doute.
Mais si tu passes aux aveux
dčs maintenant, on sait tous les deux
que tu t'en sortiras probablement.
- Pourquoi moi ?
- J'ai vérifié
tous ceux travaillant dans ce bureau
depuis deux ans.
Tu sortais du lot.
Si c'était pas autant la merde, ici,
il y aurait eu
des contrôles de routine.
Mais tu le savais sans doute.
Je me suis toujours demandé
s'ils allaient se bouger.
Mais on est ŕ Baltimore.
Et maintenant ?
Pour commencer...
passe un coup de fil.
McNulty, Freamon, Sydnor...
tous ceux concernés
devraient ętre saqués.
Suspendus avant la fin de la journée
et inculpés avant la fin de la semaine.
- Je sais, mais...
- Mais quoi ?
On doit rien faire
parce que Carcetti en souffrirait ?
Au lieu de faire le ménage,
il cherche comment cacher la crasse.
Je te jure, j'ai bien envie
d'appeler le gouverneur moi-męme.
- Cedric, non.
- Pourquoi ?
Si je laisse faire, autant agir
comme si de rien n'était devant tous.
Si on cache...
Cedric, tu ne peux rien faire.
Ce sont tes hommes.
Tu seras leur bouc émissaire.
Rien ŕ foutre.
Je me ferai virer aussi.
Tu as entendu Steintorf.
J'étais responsable de l'affaire,
des écoutes.
C'est ma carričre.
C'est tout ce que j'ai.
Si tu rends l'affaire publique
et que Carcetti en souffre,
il ne sera peut-ętre pas gouverneur,
mais il reste maire
et Bond, mon supérieur.
Et tu sais bien
que ça ne retombera pas sur eux.
- Comme toujours.
- Bon Dieu.
Tout ce pour quoi j'ai travaillé,
toutes ces années au tribunal...
Je t'en prie.
25 cents, le <i>Baltimore Sun</i>.
Monsieur, le <i>Baltimore Sun</i>, 25 cents.
- Gardez la monnaie.
- Merci, monsieur.
Les pourboires sont bons.
"... paie pour ce qu'il nous a fait.
"Je n'arrive toujours pas
ŕ le laisser monter du sous-sol."
Tu vas publier tout ça ?
C'est l'idée.
Męme la partie sur Sherrod ?
Ça apporte quoi,
une histoire comme ça ?
Comme quoi ?
Moi, Sherrod. Mes défonces,
ma désintox. Ma soeur. Tout ça.
Ŕ quoi bon publier ça ?
Les gens liront l'article et cogiteront.
Ils verront les choses d'un autre oeil.
Je sais pas.
Bubs, si tu veux pas, je publie pas.
Je sais pas.
Le <i>Baltimore Sun</i>,
le journal qui vous apporte du soleil.
Rupert, faites une déclaration
si vous voulez,
mais ça ternira surtout votre boutique
pour avoir laissé passer ça.
Le meilleur choix :
arręter ça en douceur,
puis s'occuper des responsables
en coulisse.
On les enterrera avec précaution,
et si profond que personne
ne risquera de les déterrer.
Je comprends.
M. le préfet, ętes-vous d'accord ?
Eh bien, c'est un peu
plus problématique pour moi.
Les coupables sont dans ma boutique,
n'est-ce pas ?
Je peux vous parler un instant, Bill ?
Si Rawls ne marche pas,
moi non plus.
Je ne me ferais pas de soucis
pour Bill Rawls.
Je crois qu'il est sur le point
d'avoir une révélation...
Je vous vois venir.
Je vois votre attirail
vous sortir de la tęte.
Vous vous dites :
"Je tiens Carcetti, lŕ.
"Ils ne peuvent pas
me mettre ce fiasco sur le dos
"sans faire aussi tomber leur Daniels."
Vous pensez qu'on devra virer Daniels
pour vous virer,
que ça ne ferait pas bonne figure
vu le crédit qu'on lui a donné.
Vous vous dites pas ça ?
Vous vous dites
qu'il y a un moyen d'en tirer profit.
Obtenir un mandat complet comme
préfet, retarder Daniels quelques ans,
et en échange, la boucler
et faire ce qu'on vous dit.
Vous savez quoi, Bill ?
Vous n'ętes pas loin.
Vous avez un avantage, mais un petit.
Ne surestimez pas votre main.
Comment vous la joueriez ?
Je la bouclerais et attendrais l'heure.
Une fois Tommy gouverneur,
il vous nommera
commissaire de police de l'État.
Car bien que vous ayez peut-ętre
le teint trop... blanc
pour diriger la police de Baltimore,
vous convenez pour celle du Maryland.
J'ai votre parole ?
Et j'ai la vôtre.
En coulisse, c'est le meilleur chemin.
Vous voyez ?
Le préfet de police
a retrouvé la raison.
<i>Oui ?</i>
Je dois voir M. Prezbo.
<i>Quelqu'un arrive.</i>
- Tu es élčve ici ?
- Mme Donnelly, c'est moi, Duquan.
Ça fait plaisir de te voir,
mais tu n'es plus élčve,
tu ne peux pas entrer.
Je suis juste passé voir M. Prezbo.
Il donne cours.
Je sais. Je peux attendre.
Tu vas devoir attendre dehors.
Ŕ la sonnerie,
je dirai ŕ M. Pryzbylewski
que tu l'attends ici, d'accord ?
Je vais te surprendre.
C'est déjŕ fait.
Un informateur m'a rancardé
sur une fuite
au bureau du grand jury.
Triste ŕ dire, c'est vrai.
- On est au courant.
- Mais vous savez qui c'est ?
Gary DiPasquale.
Un bon gars,
mais un parieur compulsif
et des avocats de trafiquants
pręts ŕ payer pour les infos.
Troy Sanders, Marvin Bronfman,
Dennis Cray, Sid Silverstein.
Et le meilleur ?
Maurice Levy.
Je ne blague pas.
- C'est Gary, la fuite ?
- Il a avoué directement.
Il était pręt ŕ parler.
Il avait pas le choix.
Une autorisation unilatérale d'appel
impliquant Maury Levy.
Oů est Gary ?
Il a été au deuxičme étage
remettre sa démission,
puis est rentré chez lui en attendant.
Il va bien.
Mieux que tu ne crois.
Tu sais, si on peut retourner Levy
et d'autres avocats de trafiquants,
on pourra suivre
l'argent de la drogue
ŕ travers toute la ville.
C'est triste, je sais,
mais on connait au moins la vérité.
La vérité, tu dis ?
Duquan, bonjour.
Carotte !
Damien. Tu as perdu la tęte ?
- J'ai dit carotte.
- Peu importe. Achčte-lui un sandwich.
Aprčs ça, demande ŕ Mme Williams
un balai pour nettoyer ça, compris ?
Tout de suite, Damien, ou tu es bon
pour une autre semaine de retenue.
Que je n'entende pas un seul autre mot.
Vous avez la main, on dirait.
Que deviens-tu, Duquan ?
Rien de spécial.
Tu es toujours ŕ Southwestern ?
En fait, j'ai besoin
d'un semestre de répit.
Je suis "dehors".
J'espérais
pouvoir vous emprunter de l'argent
pour me trouver une piaule,
des fringues, me remettre sur pied
pour pouvoir retourner ŕ l'école.
Tu es ŕ la rue ?
Des gens peuvent m'avoir
une chouette piaule
pour autant que j'aie de l'argent.
Il te faut combien ?
200.
Mais si vous pouvez rajouter 150,
je pourrais m'inscrire au programme
GED au centre universitaire.
Je pourrais l'avoir
sans retourner ŕ Southwestern.
Je pourrais alors travailler.
Je pense pas
qu'on puisse s'inscrire ŕ un GED
quand on a encore l'âge
pour aller au lycée.
Mais si.
Je vais te dire.
Donne-moi deux minutes,
je vais t'y conduire.
Si tu peux t'inscrire,
je ferai un chčque ŕ l'intendant.
Non, M. P, c'est pas la peine.
Puis, j'ai vraiment pas le temps
d'y aller aujourd'hui.
Mais j'irai.
Je peux le faire, Duquan,
si c'est ce que tu veux.
Je me fiche de l'argent.
Mais comprends bien, j'irai au centre
universitaire dans quelques jours
vérifier que tu es inscrit.
Si c'est le cas, je me dirai :
"Génial. Duquan pourra venir me voir
avec son diplôme quand il l'aura,
"on sera toujours amis
"et il pourra toujours compter sur moi."
Mais si tu n'es pas inscrit...
j'imagine que je ne te reverrai plus,
n'est-ce pas ?
Non, M. P.
Je vais réellement m'inscrire.
Vous verrez.
Je vais prendre mes affaires.
Rendez-vous au parking.
Et on cherchera un distributeur.
Jay, je dis seulement qu'on a suivi
toutes les pistes, les rapports sont lŕ.
Ŕ ce stade,
sauf nouveaux développements,
j'ai pas besoin de tous ces hommes.
Putain de moi, Jimmy.
La semaine passée, tu voulais
le moindre oiseau ŕ portée de main.
Ça s'est calmé. Plus de rubans rouges,
plus de corps, plus de disparitions.
Pas un mot au téléphone.
Ce truc sert ŕ rien.
Tu veux plus la mise sur écoute ?
Le juge nous a donnés 60 jours.
- Quand ils seront écoulés...
- Enculé,
c'est toi qui étais Semper Fi
pour ce tueur, et lŕ, tu glandes rien.
Jay, je veux bien enquęter.
Mais sans nouvelles pistes,
tu veux que je foute quoi ?
Je vais pas inventer.
C'est comme ça.
Si je renvoie
les équipes de surveillance,
reviens pas quęter d'autres hommes,
compris ?
C'est comme la guerre, hein ?
Facile d'y entrer,
un enfer pour en sortir.
Pearlman sait tout. Daniels aussi.
Ils ont compris.
- Comment ?
- Je sais pas.
- Bon Dieu. Qu'est-ce qu'ils...
- Je sais pas.
Elle a été claire : il ne doit plus
y avoir de meurtres de sans-abri.
Que ça ne refasse plus surface.
- Elle sait, pour Marlo ?
- Elle sait tout.
Daniels est au courant.
Aux Preuves,
ils ont fait le numéro de l'écoute
et le portable de Marlo retentit.
Pourquoi on est pas virés ? Menottés ?
Je sais pas.
Putain, Lester.
Faut qu'on sorte d'ici.
Faut qu'on réfléchisse.
Bordel de merde.
Rejoins-moi au Kavanaugh's
dans 10 min.
Combien ?
- Deux cents.
- Eh bé !
Ce prof doit te kiffer.
Allez, viens.
Ils vont lâcher des échantillons
sur Poplar Grove.
On va ętre en retard.
Allez, mon garçon.
M. l'adjoint.
Affaire ŕ suivre.
- Putain de bordel de merde.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Encore du cottage au déjeuner, Carl ?
Ça a eu lieu,
mais c'est pas pour autant de l'info.
- Mais Steve a dit...
- Il y a toujours
un cas de salmonellose quelque part.
Pourquoi couvrir celui-ci ?
La rčgle d'or de la réécriture, Spry ?
Tout casser.
Tu as lu ça ?
On crédite notre propre couverture
dans le changement d'avis
du gouverneur ?
Je suis déjŕ ŕ la tourne
et personne ne nous crédite
de quelque chose du genre.
Il va recommencer le financement.
C'est parce que Carcetti
l'a massacré sur ce problčme.
Nous, on arrive aprčs-coup.
Whiting sent le Pulitzer
du service public ?
- On dirait.
- Tu as eu le temps ?
Oui, je l'ai lu.
Et ?
Superbe.
Non, sérieux. Il y a des passages
avec un style un peu ŕ la Joe Mitchell.
J'avais l'impression
de connaître ce gars et son monde.
Sorti par le trou de la serrure.
Merci, Gus.
Une belle photo
et je demande la une du dimanche.
Faut que je m'assure
que le gars est d'accord.
- Comment ça ?
- La partie sur le gosse le dérange.
Quand il en a parlé,
- on faisait que parler.
- Il sait, pour l'article ?
Oui, mais c'est sa vie que je raconte.
Je veux ętre intčgre.
Tu vois ?
L'intégrité, j'ai pas oublié.
Ils sont pas pressés de rendre ça public
vu qu'on a pas les menottes.
Ils font semblant, comme on le fait.
Pourquoi ?
Carcetti.
Il est exposé.
En quoi ? Il a qu'ŕ nous incriminer,
nous et le service de police.
Rawls et Daniels y passeraient,
ainsi que la moitié de la hiérarchie.
Il les a nommés.
C'est son service de police.
Donc, il s'expose pile au moment
de la campagne.
Ils veulent qu'on boucle l'affaire
discretos ? Pas de problčme.
Dans six mois, aprčs l'élection,
ils pourraient nous envoyer
devant le grand jury.
On pourra toujours aller en prison.
Sinon, je risque de retourner
aux Pręts sur gages.
- Et toi, t'es bon pour le bateau.
- Et alors ? Ça en valait la peine.
Non ?
Ça dépend.
Vont-ils garder le dossier contre Marlo
et sa clique avec ce qu'ils savent ?
Pourquoi pas ? Y a toujours
les saisies et les portables.
- Ça passera sans l'écoute illégale.
- Oui. Et ils en ont fait tout un plat
sur Marlo épinglé.
La conférence de presse
et le lien avec tous les macchabs.
Pour qu'ils lâchent le dossier...
Quand t'y penses...
on en a presque autant sur eux
qu'ils en ont sur nous.
Cet aspirant Tom Wolfe
croit faire passer une telle phrase ?
Dans ton cul, enculé.
C'est comme un tricot
avec des fils qui dépassent.
T'en tires un...
Surtout des exagérations
et de citations trop parfaites,
parfois officielles.
J'en ai rappelé quelques-uns,
demandant s'ils avaient vraiment dit ça.
Tu sais ce que le délégué au logement
urbain m'a dit sur les citations ?
Qu'il aurait aimé en avoir dit,
mais qu'il n'est pas assez malin pour.
Quelqu'un prend le temps de...
retravailler ça, ça fera mal.
Tu vas faire quoi ?
Je sais pas, Robert. Je sais pas.
Garde mon nom en dehors de tout ça.
Pas de caution.
Ils prétendent une propension
ŕ la violence et intimidation de témoin.
Ils vous retiennent comme chef.
- Ils peuvent faire ça ?
- Ils peuvent essayer.
Ça dépend du juge.
Pas de caution pour Chris ?
- Il a un mandat pour meurtre.
- Monk non plus.
Pris avec trop de marchandise
et il est en conditionnelle.
Je n'ai pu que libérer M. Wagstaff
pour 300 000.
Il a cet argent ?
Avec le tiers de la maison de son oncle.
Le garant couvre le reste
sur un faux droit de rétention.
Mais pour le moment, le plus important
n'est pas la caution, mais ceci :
je dois savoir qui d'autre connaissait
le code des horloges.
Je vous l'ai dit.
Moi,
Cheese, Monk, Chris
et les ravitailleurs.
- Point.
- C'est tout ?
Personne d'autre avait mon numéro,
ŕ part vous.
Il y a un mensonge.
- Je mens pas.
- Pas de vous.
D'aprčs la police, une source
leur a dit le jour du ravitaillement.
Ça a pu se savoir. C'est possible.
Si vous vendiez en gros
dans toute la ville...
Mais ils ont pris vos portables
qu'une fois arrętés,
puis il leur a fallu des mandats
pour y voir les photos.
Et c'est au moment
oů le code a été brisé
qu'ils ont pu écrire l'acte
d'inculpation contre vous et Chris.
Ils ne vous ont pas eu avec la drogue.
Mais ils avaient des mandats d'arręt
contre vous deux en l'espace de 2 h.
Ce qui veut dire qu'ils ont brisé
le code presque aussitôt,
en un rien de temps.
J'étais sur écoute.
Mon enquęteur le pense.
Mais il n'est pas sűr quelle brigade
menait l'écoute ou qui opérait.
Quelque chose cloche.
Tu sors.
Pas toi.
Va dans les rues,
rassemble le plus de gars
et trouve le gosse.
Il a tué Snoop car il savait.
Il savait car c'est lui qui a parlé
pour le réappro.
Prépare-toi, mec.
Le garant est venu avec Levy.
C'est bon. Je m'en charge.
J'ai besoin d'un dollar.
Mec, t'as pas un dollar ?
L'ami.
L'ami, ça va ?
Attention, la voilŕ.
La redoutable...
pince de crabe !
Que se passe-t-il
quand la pince de crabe tombe...
C'est la soirée des crabes.
- Non, pince de crabe !
- Si, la pince de crabe !
La pince de crabe
a encore réussi ! Six !
Six et je sors.
Oů ça ?
Tu te fous de moi.
C'est des conne...
C'est faux, Jay. Je te le dis.
Je dois filer.
Je dois continuer ŕ jouer le jeu.
Pas le choix.
Tu as dit que les chefs savent.
Pas tous. Ceux qui savent veulent
qu'on continue de faire semblant.
Et si on arręte de faire semblant...
On terminera demain soir, d'accord ?
Ŕ plus.
T'en penses quoi ?
Je veux dire,
ça déballe tout, hein ?
Ça te ressemble.
Il t'a saisi.
Oui, ben...
Je veux dire, il t'a cerné.
Il t'aime bien, ça se voit.
Tu vois,
il dit que tout ce que tu donnes,
c'est par rapport ŕ Sherrod.
Et il te tire pas d'affaire. Mais...
Il met simplement tout en avant,
le bon et le mauvais.
Tu sais quoi ?
Ça me gęne pas,
faire savoir le mauvais.
Je connais le mauvais.
Je mens ŕ personne sur ça.
Peur qu'on dise du bien de toi ?
Plein de gens sont bénévoles.
Plein de gens vont aux réunions,
se défoncent pas au réveil.
Il me fait passer pour spécial
alors que je fais ce que j'ai ŕ faire.
Lis ça, nigaud.
"Tu peux ignorer
les souffrances du monde,
"tu en as le droit,
"et cela est conforme ŕ ta nature,
"mais il se peut que cette ignorance
"soit la souffrance
que tu aurais pu éviter."
Fanzie Kafka.
Qui c'est ?
Un auteur.
- T'as lu ses bouquins ?
- Du tout.
Mais tu te souviens de Flubber ?
Il m'a passé ça le soir
oů il m'a fait diriger la premičre fois
les réunions de Saint Martin.
Je l'ai toujours gardé depuis.
Veut dire quoi pour toi ?
Tu le reprends ?
Oui, il en a besoin,
et faut pas faire de copie.
Il est pas censé me le montrer
avant d'ętre dans le journal.
Si je l'autorise.
C'est le cas ?
Merci pour les crabes.
Ouais.
Camionnette grise.
- La plaque ?
- Je voyais pas d'oů j'étais.
Décrivez le chauffeur.
Blanc. 1,80 m.
- Pas large, ni maigre.
- Les habits ?
Rien remarqué. Quelconque.
Quelconque ?
J'ai été surpris.
Je me suis dit : "Il fait quoi, lŕ ?"
- Drôle que ce soit vous qui ayez vu ça.
- Bizarre.
Si mon interview n'avait pas duré...
Je peux rentrer ?
Je dois rejoindre mon service.
Vous avez mon numéro.
C'est un connard.
Le schnoufard se rappelle rien.
Le seul gus qui l'a emmerdé,
c'est le type qui l'a trouvé.
Ce qui s'est passé avant,
impossible ŕ dire.
Quelqu'un a voulu vous enlever,
vous traîner dans une camionnette ?
Qui a essayé de vous faire du mal ?
Mon pčre.
Mais c'était une éponge.
Inspecteur, un clochard
dit avoir vu quelque chose.
Qu'avez-vous vu ?
McNulty ?
Johnny Weaver, Tactique.
- Pourquoi pas l'avoir dit ?
- J.W. Tu protčges ta couverture.
Vaut mieux que tout le monde ici
me prenne pour un habitué.
C'est quoi, le grabuge avec Petey ?
- L'éponge ?
- Oui.
Le journaliste du <i>Sun</i>
dit avoir vu un gars
le traîner
dans une camionnette grise.
Mytho, hein ?
Oui. Petey était allongé lŕ 45 minutes
avant que cet enculé de BCBG
gare sa voiture.
- Merci.
- De rien. File 1 $, ça fera normal.
Merci, Jimmy.
Et le journaliste ?
Il peut ętre inculpé
pour fausse déclaration.
On enfermait tous les menteurs,
y aurait plus de place pour les autres.
Ça n'en vaut pas le coup.
Jay, c'est de la connerie. Je rentre.
J'ai ramené des crabes.
J'ai déjŕ fait ŕ dîner.
Mets au frigo, pour demain midi.
Je peux pas tout manger.
On peut pas imprimer ça,
surtout pas en une.
- J'ai vu ce que j'ai vu.
- Alma est au téléphone
avec le porte-parole de la police.
Officiellement et officieusement,
ils disent écarter
toute possibilité d'un enlčvement.
Ils ne font pas forcément leur travail,
et nous...
Notre boulot est de rapporter les infos,
pas les fabriquer.
Va te faire foutre, Gus.
Joli.
Ils sont jaloux de l'importance
de ses articles, mais en vérité...
On ne peut pas publier ces conneries !
Vous insinuez que Scott a inventé ?
Vous n'avez jamais remarqué
que ceux qui font ça,
les Blair, les Glass, les Kelley,
ils commencent par une petite chose,
une citation qu'ils arrangent.
Aprčs, c'est toute une anecdote.
Et trčs vite,
ils voient des trucs incroyables.
Ce sont les chanceux qui se trouvent
juste au coin de rue ŕ Tel-Aviv
quand la pizzeria explose
et une tęte roule dans la rue,
clignant encore des yeux.
Il a reçu les images.
La police a confirmé.
Ça commence toujours
par quelque chose de vrai,
de confirmé.
Puis on se retrouve avec un zigoto
ŕ l'entrée Guilford pile quand
la mystérieuse camionnette arrive...
C'est devenu personnel entre vous.
Votre jugement en est affecté.
L'article passe au service État.
Vous devriez rentrer,
réfléchir.
On parlera demain.
Vous aurez peut-ętre un Pulitzer
avec ce truc.
Et vous aurez peut-ętre ŕ le rendre.
C'est dans mes notes, Gus.
Tout ce qui s'est passé,
tout ce que le gars a dit.
Chacun de ses mots est dans mes notes !
Au bercail plus tôt que je pensais.
Oui. Le bercail.
- Il a encore frappé.
- Qui ça ?
Le tueur en série.
- Tu perds la tęte, mon salaud.
- Tu me crois pas ? Regarde
son poignet gauche.
Vous vous foutez encore de moi, Bunk ?
Un émule.
Appelle McNulty. Fais-le venir.
Ronnie.
Maury.
J'étudiais les actes d'inculpation
des arrestations Partlow-Stanfield.
- Problématique, pour le moins.
- C'est-ŕ-dire ?
Ils ont craqué le code complexe
des téléphones en quelques minutes
impliquant tout le monde.
Personne n'a autant de talent.
Enfin, pas dans la police de Baltimore.
Vous ne connaissez pas Lester Freamon.
Je sais ce que je sais.
Et ça m'a l'air d'une écoute illégale.
Vous traquiez
les téléphones de mes clients
bien avant qu'ils approchent la drogue.
Faux.
Lors de la communication préalable,
je démonterai sans problčme
cette connerie de source d'information.
Et mes sources ici me disent
qu'avec toutes les coupes budgétaires,
votre seule écoute cette année
était pour le tueur de sans-abri.
Toute autre écoute est illégale.
Sources ?
Les mises sur écoute
sont confidentielles, Maury.
Vous me dites avoir
une source d'information au sein
- du palais de justice ?
- Façon de parler.
Il y a anguille sous roche
dans votre affaire.
Et si vous attendez que ça aille au-delŕ
des mises en examen,
je ne me retiendrai pas.
Nous devrions parler.
En dehors de la cour.
Et merde.
C'est suffisant ? T'en as assez ?
Ça doit ętre le cas. Ça devrait.
On peut pas regarder
tout ce qu'a trouvé Robert
et ignorer ce qu'est ce putain de gars.
Tu le sais.
Je le sais.
Tu crois pas ?
Je pense que si tu fais ça,
ces salopards vont te trucider.
Entrez.
Pardon.
Un autre meurtre de sans-abri.
Baltimore Sud.
Fais gaffe, Gus.
Je peux pas te protéger.
- Putain, c'est pas vrai.
- Mort depuis un moment.
Et je peux déduire, Jimmy,
du fait que le ruban est pas rouge
et que tu n'as plus besoin de cadavre
car Marlo est
- en taule...
- J'y suis pour rien.
Merveilleux.
On a éliminé un suspect.
Tu vois ce que t'as créé ?
Les chefs vont te le coller sur le dos,
c'est sűr.
Les chefs savent.
- Daniels sait. Pearlman aussi.
- Mais putain...
- Combien de temps encore...
- Tu nous laisses une minute ?
Tu fous le bordel de partout
avec tes conneries.
Pourquoi t'es pas en prison ?
Le mensonge est si gros
qu'on s'en accommode.
Putain de merde, Jimmy.
Putain, je t'avais dit
qu'on en arriverait lŕ.
Tu as joué avec le feu, n'est-ce pas ?
Et maintenant,
on a tous chaud aux fesses.
<i>En direct de Baltimore Sud
oů la police a trouvé le corps </i>
<i>d'un autre homme sans-abri,
déposé sur un terrain inoccupé.</i>
Quelqu'un n'a pas eu le message ?
Vous ne les tuez pas vous-męme,
McNulty. Rassurez-moi.
Celui qui a disparu ?
Il allait bien, ŕ ma derničre visite.
Bien. C'est déjŕ ça...
je dirais.
Je croyais que vous aviez compris.
Un émule.
Pas moi.
Comment vous faisiez gober ça
au légiste ?
Certains vrais cas,
j'ai créé un lien avec les rubans.
D'autres, j'ai fait croire
ŕ une strangulation.
- Mais je sais maintenant...
- On s'en branle !
C'était pour l'argent, McNulty ?
Les heures sup' vous manquaient ?
L'affaire Stanfield.
- C'était ça.
- Je sais,
mais vous avez reçu de l'argent aussi.
Vous, Freamon
et peut-ętre une dizaine d'autres gars.
C'était pas pour l'argent.
Plus tard, quand on aura réglé ça,
et on réglera ça,
qu'aucun d'entre vous
n'attende d'heures sup'.
Qu'aucun d'entre vous n'espčre
faire du travail de policier ŕ nouveau.
Et si vous n'ętes pas
devant un grand jury actuellement,
c'est uniquement
parce que notre maire est contre.
Oh oui. Le maire connaît votre nom.
C'est donc votre derničre affaire.
- Au boulot.
- Si vous ętes
un iota aussi bon inspecteur,
vous bouclerez vite ça
et vous nous tirerez tous d'affaire.
Plus ça durera
et pire en sera le prix ŕ payer.
Que sait-il vraiment ?
Rien en comparaison de ce qu'il saura
aprčs la communication préalable.
Ils ne pourront présenter
une source d'information crédible.
Inutile
si ce n'est pas un informateur déclaré.
Une source d'information n'est...
S'il fait douter le juge, il peut
nous obliger ŕ révéler notre source.
Ça nous oblige
ŕ révéler la mise sur écoute.
Il accčde au dossier
de la compagnie téléphonique.
Avec le numéro de Stanfield d'inscrit.
La seule chose ŕ faire
est de proposer un accord.
Faites-le. Le procčs est exclu.
On peut faire pression.
Comment ?
Disons simplement que M. Levy
a son lot de problčmes ŕ régler.
Faites disparaître ça...
et le maire n'oubliera pas votre geste.
Moi non plus.
Jimmy, lčve ton cul et viens nous aider.
Comment ça fouette.
Mec, on devrait mettre ça dans la salle.
- Oů est le contenu des poches ?
- On a des doutes sur l'enlčvement.
Ces deux sacs-lŕ.
Cela concerne le journal.
Encore un appel pour une camionnette
grise et je fous le feu aux locaux
de ce putain de journal.
Ton SDF d'y a quelques jours,
il avait quoi dans les poches ?
- Des conneries.
- Des cartes de visite ?
- Oui, mais on a vérifié les alibis.
- Fais-moi voir.
Je croyais que c'était fini avec ça.
Tu vas oů avec ça ?
C'est bon.
Enculé, t'es pas si fort.
McNulty, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Ça va, Gus ?
Oui, trčs bien.
Quoi ?
Alma, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
C'est vierge.
- Quoi ?
- Le carnet qu'il t'a brandi
en te disant
qu'il était rempli de notes.
Il est vierge. Toutes les pages.
Merci.
Fils de pute. Avec ses conneries.
Sale enculé.
C'est quoi, ça ?
Alma, la télé montre la police
qui ratisse
chez les sans-abri sous Hanover Street.
Je vais ętre directe.
Faites donc.
<i>Maury, salut.</i>
- <i>Tu as Stanfield ? C'est ton client ?</i>
- <i>Oui, lui et ses gars.</i>
<i>J'ai des trucs du grand jury</i>
<i>qu'il vaut mieux
que tu vois au plus vite.</i>
- <i>Une affaire d'écoute ?</i>
- <i>Ça va t'intéresser.</i>
<i>OK. Quand peut-on se voir ?</i>
<i>Demain, aprčs le travail.
Męme montant ?</i>
- <i>Oui, le męme montant.</i>
- <i>Bien.</i>
On peut faire témoigner
Gary DiPasquale demain
et présenter
cette autorisation unilatérale d'appel.
Ou...
Voici les termes.
Pas de procčs.
Partlow plaide pour tous les cadavres
des vacantes
et prend perpétuité sans conditionnelle.
On aurait aussi voulu le 2e tueur,
mais Pearson
n'est plus.
Metcalf et Wagstaff plaident
pour détention avec intention.
Stanfield prend 10 ans pour association.
Vous faites chanter
un fonctionnaire du tribunal.
Dčs l'instant oů vous avez proposé
ce quid pro quo,
vous étiez coupable
d'entrave ŕ la justice.
Vous avez raison.
Je pourrais prendre de 6 ŕ 8 ans.
Et pour corruption d'un procureur
et violation du secret du grand jury,
vous risqueriez entre 10 et 12.
Je serai dehors
quelques années avant vous, Maury.
Ŕ votre sortie,
la premičre tournée est pour moi.
Vous me laisserez m'en tirer
si cette affaire n'est pas jugée ?
Ce dossier doit ętre
sacrément pourri. Hein ?
Pas d'inculpation d'association
pour Stanfield sans les écoutes.
Vous savez aussi bien que moi
que si on creuse un peu,
on trouvera que ces écoutes
sont illégales et donc non recevables.
Everhart 274 c. Maryland 459.
Ou Ceccolini 435 c. U.S. 268.
Męme avec des flics menteurs,
on peut gagner un procčs.
Mais il y a un gros risque en appel...
Votre cabinet en serait compromis.
Non. Vous ętes effrayés par la lumičre.
Partlow tente sa chance
contre l'inculpation réglo pour meurtre.
On ne retient pas l'association
et Stanfield et les autres sont libres.
Stanfield est libre.
Mais l'affaire reste en suspens,
pas de non-lieu. Et bien que je puisse
vous dire que certains
dans cette ville ne peuvent
supporter un scandale en cette période,
cela change
- aprčs novembre.
- Les élections.
Aprčs novembre,
personne ne sera aussi déterminé
ŕ cacher les scandales.
Si Carcetti gagne, il est ŕ Annapolis.
S'il perd, il reste maire
et peut encaisser un ou deux coups.
Alors, dites ŕ M. Stanfield
qu'il s'agit lŕ de sa seule opportunité.
Partlow plaide pour tous les meurtres
et les deux lieutenants
plaident pour la drogue.
Ensuite Stanfield prend sa retraite.
C'est fini.
Si on flaire sa présence dans la rue
ŕ nouveau,
cette affaire est réactivée
et est jugée.
Et si on doit mettre quelques flics
en prison avec lui, soit.
On produira les preuves
et on encaissera le coup.
Votre client sort
maintenant,
ou aucun de vous deux ne s'en sort.
On y va. Debout.
C'est ŕ moi.
C'est ŕ vous. Je sais.
Vous avez une carte ?
C'est pas une carte.
On s'est déjŕ vus, vous vous souvenez ?
Menteur.
Menteur noir.
Pourquoi tuer votre ami ?
Il boit...
Il boit tout le temps.
Mais vous lui avez mis un ruban
au poignet. Comme pour les autres.
Vous avez vu ça ŕ la télé ?
Le ruban au poignet.
Vous en avez entendu parler
par d'autres ?
Pourquoi vous avez fait ça
avec le ruban ?
Personne comprend.
Vous ne comprenez pas.
Je sais toujours ce que je vais faire...
avant de le faire. D'accord ?
Je sais toujours ce que je vais faire.
Vous avez tué les autres ?
Vous les avez tous tués ?
Tous sans exception !
Je l'ai fait parce que je savais
que j'allais le faire.
J'en ai tué des millions.
D'accord ? Et ils m'ont tous tué.
Alors vous avez commis
tous ces meurtres, hein ?
Vous ętes un lâche.
Je le vois.
Vous avez une carte ?
Le journaliste est lŕ
pour reconnaître des photos.
Quoi ?
Jay, c'est un mytho.
Je le sais.
Mais le journal en a fait un tel plat
que le commissaire veut qu'on simule,
pour dire qu'on l'a fait.
Bonjour, inspecteur.
Pas de camionnette.
Il n'a pas de camionnette grise.
Pas de camionnette grise.
Et il t'a pas appelé non plus, hein ?
Ni la 1re fois
ni la seconde. C'était moi.
"Tu m'as mortifié devant mon pčre ?"
Et les photos que t'as reçues ?
Je les ai prises.
Et le type disparu ?
C'est mon petit-cousin.
On l'a envoyé ŕ Atlantic City
avec un rouleau de pičces.
Tu sais pourquoi
je peux te dire tout ça ?
Parce que, sale enculé de menteur,
tu racontes autant de conneries que moi.
Et tu dois faire avec et t'en servir
autant que tu peux, pas vrai ?
Piégés dans le męme mensonge.
La seule différence :
je sais pourquoi j'ai agi ainsi.
Mais j'ai pas la moindre idée
de ce que ça te rapporte.
- Mais je fais pas partie de ta tribu.
- Vous n'ętes pas sérieux...
Non, je suis un putain de guignol...
Tout comme toi.
Maintenant, barre ta gueule.
Vous ętes libre.
Chris prend perpétuité pour tous
les meurtres, sans conditionnelle.
- Sans conditionnelle ?
- Non.
Mais ils le tiennent
sur celui avec son ADN.
Ça passerait ? Chris est loyal ?
Tant que je m'occupe
de sa famille.
Cheese et Monk : 20 pour la drogue.
Mais pas d'enquęte sur les biens,
vous gardez tout votre argent.
Pourquoi ils me libčrent ?
Ils préféreraient pas,
mais une couille dans leur dossier
ne doit pas sortir au procčs.
Mais voilŕ le hic :
si vous restez dans le bizness,
ils sortiront ce truc. Sans aucun doute.
En ce moment, avec l'élection,
ils vous laissent ce marché.
Mais passé novembre,
s'ils ont le moindre doute,
ils peuvent sortir l'affaire du placard
et la couille dans le dossier
pourrait ne pas vous sauver.
Vous comprenez ?
Céder la couronne.
C'est le marché, fiston.
Aucun avocat ne pourrait obtenir mieux.
Comment ça a été, patron ?
Fiston,
tu es une mine d'or pour moi.
Tu le sais ?
Tu nous as fait passer
ŕ la puissance supérieure.
Moi ?
En me rancardant sur cette écoute,
tu m'as sauvé la mise.
Mais maintenant,
si Marlo accepte le marché,
il sera libéré
aprčs une inculpation sur une saisie
de drogue de plusieurs millions.
Ça arrive rarement.
Et quand ça arrive, le nom et numéro
de l'avocat de la défense
tombent dans la poche de chaque
respectable trafiquant de drogue.
Tu es un génie de m'avoir amené ça.
Je fais que mon boulot.
Si tu veux savoir un truc,
il suffit de demander.
C'est ça, un détective, non ?
Tiens.
Viens dîner ce soir.
Yvette fait de la poitrine de boeuf.
Chez toi ?
Tu es de la <i>mishpocha</i>, maintenant.
Si tu le dis.
C'est bouclé.
Non pas que ça puisse finir en procčs.
Le mec est déséquilibré.
Rien ŕ redire.
Une chambre matelassée
au centre Clifton T. Perkins
est requise.
Il s'attribue tout ?
Que les deux derniers.
- Il nie les autres ?
- Il nie pas vraiment grand-chose.
Il plaidera pour tout ce qu'on veut.
Alors retournez-y.
Pardon ?
S'il est déséquilibré, ça change quoi
qu'il plaide pour deux ou six ?
Il finira les mains liées
ŕ bouffer de la gélatine.
Il a tué les deux derniers.
Enculé.
Vous ętes ŕ un poil de chatte d'une mise
en exam et vous venez me contredire ?
J'ai fait ce que j'ai fait. Je sais.
Et lŕ, je suis responsable de 2 meurtres
récents. Je sais ce que j'ai fait.
Mais je ne ferai pas ça.
C'est fini.
Tous nos citoyens peuvent
dormir sur leurs deux oreilles
en sachant que l'homme responsable
a été appréhendé
grâce aux efforts continus
des enquęteurs.
Est-il inculpé pour tous les meurtres
ou seulement deux ?
D'aprčs ce que j'ai compris...
Pour les deux derniers incidents,
mais d'aprčs ce que j'ai compris,
il est suspecté de tous les crimes.
Nous attendons les résultats d'ADN.
Tout porte ŕ croire qu'il pourrait
ętre handicapé mental
et que des poursuites complémentaires
s'avéreraient donc redondantes.
J'aimerais également citer le préfet
adjoint aux opérations Daniels
pour non seulement avoir mené
ces enquętes ŕ terme,
mais également pour les meurtres de
l'an dernier dans les maisons vacantes.
Il nous a fourni un travail
si remarquable que je pense
que le moment convient
pour annoncer que nous proposerons
le nom de l'adjoint au conseil municipal
pour entérinement en tant
que préfet de police de Baltimore.
Le préfet suppléant Rawls, envers qui
je suis également trčs reconnaissant,
servira comme conseiller
dans l'attente de nouvelles
responsabilités ŕ la mairie.
<i>Sauvez notre Sun</i>
Travaillez l'arrestation avec Alma.
Votre signature doit apparaître.
Je me sens pas trčs bien,
mon ventre...
Je dois rentrer.
Désolé.
Ayant réchappé ŕ l'affaire des SDF,
sachez que le maire et moi
vous remercierons de votre discrétion.
Mais ŕ l'heure actuelle,
nous devons rester ŕ l'affűt
pour ce qui est du crime
dans sa globalité.
Vos rapports de crime hebdomadaires
des unités de districts
n'indiquent pas le genre de réduction
s'approchant d'une baisse de 10 %
sur le trimestre.
Elles sont nettes.
- Je vous demande pardon.
- Les stats sont nettes.
Elles resteront nettes.
Soit nous réparons cette police
et le crime diminue,
ou nous ne le faisons pas
et le crime reste élevé.
M. le préfet, il s'agit
d'un petit coup de pouce
sur les deux prochains trimestres.
Voilŕ tout.
Non. Je ne peux pas.
Vous ętes docile pour le fiasco des SDF,
mais ceci vous fait grincer ?
Dites au maire
que ses stats seront nettes.
Avant l'élection.
Aprčs l'élection.
Vous avez raison.
Ils ne peuvent pas vous virer.
Pas sans que ça ricoche sur la mairie.
Si ça ne vous dérange pas
d'ętre enterré dans une unité,
vous pourrez rester aussi longtemps
que vous le supporterez.
Ou le temps d'avoir la retraite.
Mais dans le męme temps,
je ne peux vous laisser
faire du travail de police.
Rien qui finira
dans une salle d'audience.
Je refuse.
Pour vous deux,
c'est fini.
Marlo s'en tire.
Ou tu vas en prison.
Et tu n'as pu faire mieux
avec Levy, hein ?
Je veux dire, lâcher l'argent...
J'ai eu ce que je pouvais.
Tu as perdu la trace de l'argent,
Lester,
quand tu as décidé
de colorier en dehors des lignes.
Ce n'est pas de ma faute.
Putain, comment ça, tu vends ?
Je vends l'assos.
Combien, yo ?
- 10 millions.
- Sa mčre !
Ou au plus offrant
si vous ętes plusieurs ŕ lâcher 10.
Si vous croyez que c'est pas le prix,
je remets ce truc
dans ma poche et allez revendre
cette merde frelatée de New York.
Si tu permets que je pose la question,
pourquoi tu vends ?
Je veux dire, męme d'ici,
tu peux pécho une part
en te la coulant pépčre, négro.
Je resterai pas ici.
Le dossier qu'ils ont contre moi
s'effrite déjŕ.
Mais en vérité,
j'en ai fini
avec cette histoire de gangster.
- Je connais les rouages.
- Tu es autre chose
qu'un gangster ?
Homme d'affaires.
Ouais, le grand,
j'ai aussi du mal ŕ m'y faire.
Bref,
si vous pouvez pas atteindre mon tarot,
unissez-vous.
Mais les ravitailleurs
traiteront avec vous
qu'aprčs que j'aie fait
les présentations.
Aprčs, je me retire.
Vous ętes mal.
- Daniels se rebiffe ?
- On est tous mal
si le crime ne baisse pas.
Carcetti ne devient pas gouverneur
et vous, maire.
Et męme s'il gagne, Nerese,
vous ętes coincée avec un préfet
qui refuse de travailler avec vous.
Je ne suis pas du tout coincée.
Daniels revient ŕ lui ou il est fini.
On l'a sacré. Pas de marche arričre.
Il le sait.
Soit il apprend ŕ rester ŕ sa place,
ou il proposera sa démission.
Vous ętes pas le seul
ŕ savoir jouer ŕ ce jeu.
Que peut-on dire de ce quidam ?
Je vais finir
par pondre les mots justes.
Moi, doté d'une voix d'or
que tous les enculés d'ici,
séparés de la religion,
vous risquez jamais d'entendre.
Que puis-je dire du cher disparu ?
Vraiment.
- Il est mort trop jeune.
- Męme pas 40 ans.
Mais si elle avait survécu,
sa bite en aurait eu 134.
Tais-toi. Ça commence ŕ venir.
C'était la brebis galeuse,
l'éternel paria.
Il n'a jamais demandé quartier
aux chefs qui lui ont jamais fait.
Il n'a retenu aucune leçon.
Il n'a reconnu aucune erreur.
C'était un irlandiche tętu débarqué
qui s'est dégoté un insigne.
Il n'a admis aucune autorité.
Il faisait ce qu'il voulait,
il disait ce qu'il voulait,
et au final,
c'est lui qui vous donnait
les autorisations.
C'était un policier né.
Pour sűr. Et je ne dis pas ça
pour moult gens.
Męme allongés sur le feutre,
je ne lâche pas ça
ŕ moins que ce ne soit vrai.
Un policier né.
Mais bon sang, quel trouduc.
Et je ne parle pas de l'orifice normal
que nous possédons tous.
Mais d'un qui couvre tout,
qui consume tout,
hors de proportion
avec l'abîme de son humanité.
"Cette région inexplorée"
- je me permets de citer Shakespeare -
"d'oů nul voyageur ne revient."
- J'ai fait quoi ?
- Ta gueule.
T'es mort pour nous.
Voici son complice.
Allons, allons. Tout doux.
Je suis civil, maintenant. Tout doux.
Tu as rendu ton dossier, hein ?
- Cet aprčs-midi. 32 ans.
- Et 4 mois.
Vous l'avez bien retouché.
Il fait 10 ans de moins
que ce dont je me souviens.
Allez, il y a assez de place
pour vous deux.
Un seul ŕ la fois.
On colle pas un homme ŕ sa veillée.
Viens te blottir, Lester.
Garde notre secret, Jimmy.
Shardene est avec moi ce soir.
Si vous voulez bien nous épargner
ce fâcheux écart homoérotique,
je conclus
avec mes remarques élégiaques.
Alors vas-y, sale jacasseur.
Pour conclure...
Pour conclure, je dis
il nous a donné 13 ans de service.
Pas assez pour la retraite,
- mais assez pour qu'on sache...
- Mets la musique, Hugh !
... malgré son ascendance irlandaise
insignifiante,
ses défauts de personnalité
et sa sobriété et son hygične
inconstantes...
qu'il était un vrai flic de la Crim.
Jimmy,
je dis ça sérieusement.
Si j'étais étalé mort
dans un coin de rue de Baltimore,
j'aimerais que ce soit toi au-dessus
de moi, en charge de l'enquęte.
Conneries.
Parce que, frčre, quand tu assurais,
tu étais le meilleur d'entre nous.
Si t'étais étalé mort
dans un coin de rue,
ce serait sűrement Jimmy
qui t'aurait buté.
Ta gueule.
Si t'étais en charge, tu serais
en train de me chauffer les oreilles.

Comment Nerese Campbell l'a eu ?
Tu crois que j'ai demandé ?
Tu crois que ça importe ?
Elle me l'a donné
car elle a pensé que tu m'écouterais.
Maintenant, ils veulent mon départ.
Vu sa formulation,
elle voulait que tu restes
si tu revenais ŕ la raison.
Revenais ŕ la raison.
Elle veut que je trafique les stats
pour Carcetti.
Ce trimestre et le suivant.
Dissimuler le crime,
le faire élire gouverneur
et elle, maire.
Fais-le.
Burrell les a trafiquées avant toi.
Warren Frasier avant lui.
Et aprčs ton départ,
ce sera Rawls ou un autre. Et alors ?
J'avalerai un mensonge quand je devrai.
J'en ai avalé de gros derničrement.
Mais les jeux de stats, ce mensonge,
c'est ce qui a ruiné cette police.
Éclairer de la merde,
appeler ça de l'or, ergo le commissaire
devient colonel, le maire, gouverneur.
Feindre le travail de police
quand une génération
forme la suivante
ŕ ne pas faire son devoir. Et que...
J'ai regardé Carcetti dans les yeux.
Je lui ai serré la main.
Je lui ai demandé s'il était sincčre.
C'est ce mensonge
que je ne peux encaisser.
Si je le fais, Nerese m'a dans la poche.
Et je ne sers ŕ personne ainsi.
Alors pars.
Retire-toi pour raisons personnelles
ou raisons de santé.
N'importe.
Tu as ton diplôme de droit.
Tu ne vas pas mourir de faim.
Mais si tu ne pars pas,
ils nous briseront tous les deux.
Il n'y a pas assez pour m'inculper.
Et le plus drôle,
j'en ai vu assez ces derniers jours
pour les inculper.
Pour quoi ?
Alors sers-t'en, Cedric.
Ou au moins menace de le faire.
Des gens seraient touchés.
Des gens ŕ qui je tiens.
Alors, tu es fini.
Ce dossier contient assez pour que
ta candidature ne soit pas entérinée.
Et assez pour que ma carričre soit morte
avant męme qu'elle n'ait commencé.
L'arbre qui ne courbe pas
s'abat, Cedric.
Trop courbé, on est déjŕ abattu.
Marlo en liberté.
Et l'argent, Jimmy.
Elle a concédé ça aussi.
On ne suivra pas l'argent.
On se demandait oů t'étais.
- Je savais pas si je devais venir.
- Putain, pourquoi ?
C'est moi qui l'ai dit ŕ Daniels.
Je voulais pas
agir dans votre dos,
mais... fallait que ce soit fait.
Bref,
ce fut un plaisir de servir avec vous.
Je voulais aussi dire ça.
Quoi ?
Tu vas pas bibine avec moi ?
Si, si tu veux.
Inspecteur,
si tu pensais que c'était nécessaire,
j'imagine que c'était le cas.
Tu viens ?
Milton amčne six cents.
Et le petit Glen en est pour trois.
J'ai cinq venant de moi
et j'ai cinq du Chinois
pour nous rejoindre.
Il nous manque 900.
- Je peux les étaler. Aucun blčme.
- Quoi ?
D'oů tu sors cette maille ?
Cheese connaît le biz.
On vend de la dope et de la coke
ŕ Baltimore, négro.
Celui qui a pas cette oseille
devrait avoir honte.
Tu mets quand męme
plus que ta part, lŕ.
Vu comment je vois la chose,
on aura tous plus que rentabilisé
quand l'assos sera ŕ nous.
Putain, négro, on était pénards
quand elle était ŕ ton oncle.
Il a fallu
que t'ailles te mettre avec Marlo.
Tu vois, ça ? Tu vois,
c'est la mauvaise approche.
Car Joe a eu son heure,
et Omar y a mis fin.
Puis Marlo a eu son heure,
aussi courte fűt-elle,
et les flics y ont mis fin.
Et maintenant,
fils de pute, c'est notre heure.
La mienne et la tienne.
Mais au lieu de fermer tes fesses
et cracher la maille, tu viens pleurer
sur le passé.
Y a pas de passé, négro !
Y a pas de nostalgie avec cette merde.
Il y a que la rue,
le biz et ce qui se passe aujourd'hui.
Tu as raison.
Quand c'était mon oncle,
j'étais avec mon oncle.
Quand c'était Marlo, j'étais avec lui.
Mais lŕ, négro...
Pourquoi t'as fait ça, putain ?
Maintenant, il nous manque les neuf.
C'était pour Joe.
Ce putain de sentimental
vient de nous faire perdre du blé.

Pourquoi ne pas

- Ils t'ont dit quoi ?
Que j'avais fait un travail remarquable.
Qu'il s'agissait uniquement
de renforcer le bureau du comté.
Je leur ai pas parlé du bloc-notes.
- Je l'ai pas mentionné.
- Je leur ai dit.
Tu avais des ennuis,
j'ai dit ŕ Whiting que je pensais
que tu avais raison pour Scott.
Je lui ai parlé du bloc-notes.

Félicitations, sergent Goette. Je sais
que vous réussirez dans le district est.
Content d'avoir pu faire ça au moins.
- Félicitations, lieutenant Carver.
- Merci, M. le Préfet.
Je regrette de ne pas servir
sous vos ordres.
L'info circule, hein ?
C'est passé sur WBAL aujourd'hui.
Ils disent que vous partez
pour raisons familiales...
Je dois avoir des enfants
dont je n'ai connaissance.
BAL a dit qui sera le préfet suppléant ?
J'en ai peur.
Mesdames et messieurs,
pour ce qui sera peut-ętre mon dernier
arręté en tant qu'officier de police,
permettez-moi de féliciter
tous les officiers promus,
leur famille, leurs collčgues
et leurs amis.
Si tu fais pas gaffe, ils te nommeront
commissaire, tu seras alors bien niqué.
Bien oučj.
Je suis fier de toi.
Tu vois, tu t'intéresses ŕ un truc
quand c'est pas ton tour.
C'était celui de la brigade ŕ Lehman.
- Il me fallait les heures sup'.
- Et t'écopes d'un meurtre sans témoins,
sans suspect et sans la moindre chance
de le boucler.
Tu réponds au tél comme une bleue.
Fais pas ta piailleuse.
Et marche pas sur la douille
derričre toi.
Je vais pas la déplacer.
Elle est sur le côté.
Je vais reculer
et déplacer aucune douille
que t'auras pas indiquée
avec des lettres et chiffres.
Vous vous rappelez de moi ?
J'avais amené ce type,
je voulais voir comment il allait.
Il est parti au bout de deux nuits.
Désolée.
- Oů vont les sans-abri ici ?
- Différents endroits.
Prčs de la rivičre,
dans le quartier des entrepôts...
Certains endroits
seraient dangereux pour vous.
Je suis de la police. Enfin, j'étais.
Attendez ici. Je vous cherche un plan.
Si le commissaire était un peu futé,
il saurait que nous avons
de quoi avoir un enregistreur graphique.
Le lieutenant Carver le lui a dit.
Mais il essaie
de foutre ce truc au placard.
Je dis seulement qu'en passant
un coup de fil ou deux, vous verrez
qu'on fait pression sur eux
pour s'asseoir dessus,
bien qu'on ait 3 meurtres
contre cette bande.
Le préfet de police est-il au courant ?
Lui ? Il reconnaîtrait pas
le travail de police
s'il venait défoncer sa porte
avec un mandat.
Simplement...
gardez mon nom en dehors de tout ça.

Tu en veux un ?

Tu veux que je sois lŕ, crois-moi.
Sinon de tels types te saigneront.
Je veux que tu rencontres

Attention ŕ ça. Tu vas prendre du poids.
Mais la prochaine fois, fais gaffe
ŕ bien surveiller le fric...
Fais pas ça.
Temps de lâcher ça.
- Tu sais qui je suis ?
- Tu t'appelles Vinson.
T'étais la banque de Marlo,
mais Marlo est plus de la partie,
et tu déplaces encore du fric
pour d'autres lascars, donc...
une partie de ce fric me revient.
Putain.
T'es qu'un petit.
C'est que ton genou.
Cet enculé de sa mčre
m'a foutu une bastos.
Au plaisir, messieurs.
Non, yo, c'est des conneries.
J'ai entendu autre chose.
La vérité sur Omar :
des flics ont fait croire
que c'était des mecs de New York.
Mais c'est eux qui l'ont tué.
Écoute, enculé,
je sais ce qui lui est arrivé.
Les flics ont rien ŕ voir lŕ-dedans.
Ni les mecs de New York.
Omar a un AK.
Mais il est cerné. Ils sont
huit, neuf enculés
et ils ont tous des .9.
- Mais lui : "Vous croyez..."
- Tu regardes quoi, lŕ ?
Toi, négro.
- Tu sais qui je suis ?
- Négro, et moi ?

Merci.

Premičre affaire et je dois me récuser.
Votre Honneur,
merci de votre bienveillance.
Félicitations, Commissaire.
Bienvenue ŕ bord.
- Merci, Gouverneur. J'en suis ravi.
- Merci ŕ vous.
Larry...
Rentrons au bercail.
- But if we...
but how can...
- jesus christ.
- So this means that,
uh...
- so no one killed
any homeless men.
- No serial killer.
Some were random killings,
some were natural deaths
That were likely manipulated.
But they're not linked
in any way.
- But why?
- The detectives used
the money to fund a case
Against the drug
traffickers responsible
For the slayings in
the vacants a year ago.
- Last week's arrests and
seizures were a direct result.
- So let me just
understand this...
so i've been going out there
for weeks,
Slamming the governor for
his neglect of the
Homeless and declaring
how we will stop
At nothing to findhe
person responsible for
Preying on the homeless
and all the while--
Hey, norman,
this is my ass here.
- That's true, boss.
But it does have a
certain charm to it.
They manufactured
an issue to get paid,
We manufactured an
issue to get you
Elected governor.
Everybody's gettin'
what they need behind
Some make-Believe.
- The detectives involved
will be suspended and
Ultimately fired,
at the least.
Beyond that,
a criminal prosecution
On fraud and perjury
charges is probable.
- So, what, you're saying
we call a press conference
And we say,
"hey, by the way,
"All that stuff about homeless
people getting killed and
"The governor cutting
the safety net and us doing
"Everything in our power
to catch the guy,
Hey, guess what,
the joke's on us?"
- Not to mention that
the evidence against
The traffickers arrested
last week is tainted.
That case could
collapse as well.
- I don't fucking
believe this.
You two are on point here.
Word of this gets
down to annapolis,
The governor's
gonna wreck me with it.
And if it comes to that,
you guys drop on your swords,
So help me.
- How does word
not get out
Once we suspend
the detectives?
Never mind sending it
to the grand jury
- The cops that did this,
they gotta go.
You cannot be telling me
i have to live with this.
- Deputy, counselor...
if you two will excuse us,
we are going to
Discuss this first as
a matter of public policy.
Until we can reason the
best way to address this,
Do nothing and speak
to no one
About any of this.
- If this becomes
public in the wrong way,
A lot of people who
were legally responsible
For the situation,
good people
Who were nonetheless in a
supervisory role here...
are going to suffer.
And that's not the
outcome that anyone wants.
- What mike is saying is
that we need to
Be very careful
about how to proceed.
- I wish i was still
at the newspaper
So i could write
on this mess.
It's too fuckin' good.

We don't have anything

I don't think...
- 40,000 from the showboat
on the boardwalk.
26 at the borgata.
80 over the last
year at the taj mahal...
and that's just the
atlantic city casinos.
- I like to play. So what?
- You lost three times
your salary over
The last two years.
I ran you through sentinel
title and came back
With seven pages of liens
and a third mortgage
You folded on two months ago.
Gary, you're done.
- What do you mean?
- We found sealed grand
jury papers in the houses
Of drug dealers.
And we've got people
naming you on it.
You have a problem, gary.
But you have friends
in this courthouse,
Lifelong friends.
Cop to the problem,
give up the names of those
That bought from you.
Disbarred? Yeah, no doubt.
But you play it clean
from this moment on,
And we both know
you'll probably walk.
- Why did you look at me?
- I ran the finances
on everyone who worked
This unit over the
last couple years.
You were the only bogie.
If the s.A.O. Weren't
so screwed up,
They'd have been
running background
Checks as a routine.
But i guess you knew that.
- I always wondered if they'd
get their shit together.
But that's baltimore,
isn't it?
So what happens now?
- Well, for starters...
you're gonna make
a phone call.
- Mcnulty, freamon,
Sydnor,
Anyone who has the smell of
this on them should be gone.
Before the close of business,
they should be suspended
And before the end
of the week, indicted.
- I know, but...
- But what?
We're gonna let this shit
stand because it'll
Hurt carcetti to air it out?
Instead of cleaning
house like we need to,
He's up there figuring
out how to hide the dirt.
I swear, i gotta mind
to call the governor myself
And just let it fly.
- Cedric, you can't.
- Why not?
If i let this thing stand,
i might as well just
Roll over and play dead
for every police
Who knows about this.
We cover this up...
- cedric, you can't
do anything.
Those are your detectives.
They need someone to blame,
they will measure you for it...
- i don't give a fuck.
- And they'll fire me.
You heard steintorf...
i was in charge of this thing.
I was on that wiretap...
this is my career.
This is everything.
You go public,
and it hurts carcetti.
Maybe he doesn't get
to be governor.
But he is still the mayor
and bond is still my boss
And you know the weight
will not fall on them.
It never does.
- Christ.
- Everything
i've worked for, all those years
In that courthouse...
please.
- 25 cents.
"Baltimore sun."
Sir, "baltimore sun."
One quarter.
- Keep it.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.
- People tip pretty good,
don't they?
- Paining for what
he had done to us.
I'm sorry for him, man,
really, but i still
Can't let him come up
from the basement.
You gonna put all
that in the paper?
- That's the plan.
- Even the parts
about sherrod?
- Yeah.
- What good is...
what good is a story
like that?
- Like what?
- Me, sherrod.
Gettin' high. Not gettin' high.
My sister,
all that shit in there.
What good do any of that
do to put it in the newspaper?
- People read it,
they think about it.
Maybe see things different.
- I don't know, man.
- Bubs, you don't
want me to do this,
I won't do it.
- I don't know.
"Baltimore sun."
A little bit of sun.
Sun paper.
- Look, rupert,
you can go public with
This thing if you want,
But your shop is going
to come out looking
Worse for letting it
happen in the first place.
- The better move is
to shut it down quietly
And then deal with
those responsible
Through back channels.
We'll bury these guys softly,
And in a hole so deep
no one will ever get close
To digging them up.
- I can see that.
- Commissioner,
do you agree?
- Well, it is a
little more problematic for me.
The offenders are in my shop,
are they not?
- Can i have a word with you
in private, bill?
- Hey, if rawls isn't in,
i'm not either.
- Oh, i wouldn't worry
about bill rawls.
I believe he's about to
have one of those road
To damascus moments....
- i can see what
you're thinking in there.
I can see the gears
grinding in that head
Of yours.
You're thinking, hey,
i might have some wood
On carcetti here.
After all, there's no way
they can pin the blame
On me for this fiasco
without doing their
Boy daniels, too, right?
You're thinking we'd have
to fire daniels
To fire you and
that wouldn't sit well
Given how much we've
already sold daniels.
Isn't that what you're thinking?
And so you're telling
yourself maybe there's
A way for you
to leverage this.
To get yourself a full
term as commissioner,
To delay daniels a
few more years in
Exchange for you
shutting the fuck up
And doing what
you're told.
And you know what, bill?
You're not far off.
You do have a little
leverage here,
But just a little.
And i wouldn't overplay
your hand.
- How would you play it?
- I'd shut the fuck up
and wait your turn,
And when tommy gets
to the statehouse,
He brings you
with him to be state
Police superintendent,
Because while you may be
a shade too white
To run the baltimore
department,
You're just about right
for the m.S.P.
- I have your word?
- And i have yours.
- Back channel is
the way to go.
- See?
The police commissioner
done fell off his ass.
- Can i help you?
- Um, i need to see
mr. Prezbo.
- Someone will come down.
- Are you a student here?
- Ms. Donnelly, it's me,
duquan.
- Well, it's good to see
you, duquan,
But you're not a student
here so i can't
Let you inside.
- I just came past to see
mr. Prezbo.
- Well, he's teaching
right now.
- I know. I can wait.
- Well, you're gonna
have to stay outside,
And after the bell,
i'll tell
Mr. Pryzbylewski you're out
here for him, okay?
- I'm going to surprise
you with something.
- You already have.
- I got a tip from
an informant about a
Leak out of the grand
jury unit,
Sad to say it's
checked out.
- We know about the leak.
- Yeah, but do you
know who it is?
Gary dipasquale.
Decent enough guy,
but he's got a bear of
A gambling problem
and a bank of
Drug lawyers who are
willing to pay for
Their look-Sees.
Troy sanders, marvin bronfman,
Dennis cray, sid silverstein.
And the pick
of the litter? Maurice levy.
I kid you not.
- Gary is their leak?
- He broke right away.
He was ready to give it up.
He needed to.
One-Party consent
call implicating maury levy.
- Where's gary now?
- He went up to the second
floor to hand
In his letter of
resignation, then he went home
To wait for the sword
to drop.
He's oy,
he's better than you'd think.
You know, if we can turn
levy and some of these
Other drug lawyers,
we can route the drug
Money all over town.
It's sad business,
i know, but at least
We know the truth now,
right?
- The truth, you say?
- Hey.
- Duquan, hello.
- Snatch-Pops.
- Hey!- Damien. You lost
- But i said snatch-Pops.
- I don't care what you said.
You're gonna buy him
a new sandwich,
And past that, you're gonna
go inside and ask mr. Williams
For a broom to clean that up,
you understand?
- But, mr. P...
- right now, damien,
orou're mine for another
Week of detention.
I don't want to hear
another word.
- Looks like you got
the hang of it.
- What's up with you, duquan?
- Oh, ain't nothing.
- You still at southwestern?
- Well, i'm, like, needing
a semester off,
You know?
I'm outdoors now.
And, um...
i was hoping maybe i
could get with you
And borrow some money,
So i could get a place
and some clean clothes
And get myself
settled so i can go back
To school.
- You're on the street?
- I mean, i got some people
ready to give me
A really, really good place
if i can come up
With some money for it.
- How much do you need?
- Couple hundred.
But if you could go
one fifty more,
I could enroll
in the g.E.D. Program
Down b.C.C.C.
Then i could get my
g.E.D. Without having
To go back to southwestern,
Then i could get
my work permit.
- I don't think
you're eligible for
A g.E.D. Program if
you're still of age
To attend high school,
duquan.
- Yeah, you are.
- I'll tell you what.
Give me a couple minutes,
i'll drive you down there.
And if you are eligible,
i'll write a check
Right to the bursar's
office down there.
- Naw, mr. P., you ain't
got to through all that.
Besides, i really ain't
got the time to
Go down there today.
But, you know, i'm gonna.
- I can do it, duquan,
if that's what you want.
And i don't even care
about the money.
But understand i'm gonna
go down to b.C.C.C.
In a few days and find
out if you're enrolled.
If you are,
i'm gonna say, "great,
"Duquan can come past
with his certificate
"When he gets it,
and we're still friends
And he can still
rely on me."
But if you aren't enrolled,
then...
well, i imagine i'm not
gonna see you again,
Am i?
- No, mr. P.
I'm definitely gonna enroll.
You'll see.
- I'll get my stuff.
I'll meet you in the lot
and we'll go find
A bank machine.
- Jay, all i'm saying
is we've run down
All the leads we had,
all the office reports
Are in and at this point,
barring any new developments,
I don't need all
this fucking manpower.
- Fuck me, jimmy.
Last week you were crying
for every swinging
Dick you could get
your hands on.
- Well, the case
has gone quiet.
There's no red ribbons.
There's no bodies.
There's no disappearances.
There's not a fucking
word on the cell phone.
This thing's fucking
thing is useless.
- So what? You don't want
the wiretap either now?
- Well, the judge gave
us 60 days,
Once that runs out,
then...
- motherfucker,
you were the one who was
All semper fi for this
serial killer
And now you're fuckin'
the dog.
- Jay, i'm ready
to work the case.
But short of any new
leads or developments,
What the fuck do you
want me to do?
I can't make shit up,
can i?
It is what it is.
- If i send the
surveillance teams back, jimmy,
Don't come crying for
more manpower tomorrow.
You hear?
- Shit is like a war,
ain't it?
Easy to get in,
hell to geout.
- Pearlman
knows everything. Daniels, too.
They figured it out.
- How?
- I don't know.
- Jesus.
What are they...
- i don't know.
She made it clear
in no uncertain terms
There are not to be any
further homeless killings.
Nothing more on this
case whatsoever.
- Does she know about marlo,
that our case--
- She knows everything.
Daniels knows.
They went down to the
e.C.U., dialed up the wiretap
Number and up pop's
marlo's cell phone.
- Why aren't we fired?
Why aren't we in fucking
bracelets?
- I don't know.
- Oh shit, lester.
We gotta get outta here.
We gotta think this
thing through.
Oh, jesus fucking christ.
- Look, meet me down
at kavanaugh's in ten minutes,
All right?
- Jimmy?
- How much?
- Two hundred.
- Damn, boy.
Teacher must love
your black ass.
C'mon with it.
They gonna put out testers
up on poplar grove.
We gonna be late for it.
C'mon, boy. C'mon.
C'mon.
- Deputy...
- to be continued.
- Fuck fuck fucking fuck.
- Ah, what's the matter?
Cottage cheese for lunch
again there, carl?
- Just because it happened
doesn't mean it's news.
There's always a
salmonella outbreak somewhere.
I don't see why we have to
cover this one...
- what's the first rule
of rewrite, spry?
- Shoot it down.
- Did you read this?
We are crediting our
own coverage with
Changing the
governor's mind?
I'm already to the jump
and there's not a
Quote from anyone
crediting us
With anything of the sort.
- Yeah, the guv
is restoring funding, all right.
That's 'cause carcetti's
been beating the shit
Out of him
on this issue.
We're just an afterthought.
- Whiting can smell the
public service pulitzer, huh?
- Seems so.
- You get a chance yet?
- Yeah, yeah. I read it.
- And?
- Beautiful.
No, no, no. I mean it.
You got some real joe mitchell
stuff on the page there.
Really makes me feel like
i know this guy and his world.
You just pulled it all
through the keyhole.
- Thanks, gus.
- We get some good art,
i'm gonna push for
The sunday front.
- Well, the thing is,
i gotta make sure
The guy is good
with it.
- What do you mean?
- The part of the story about
the kid still bothers him,
And when he told me about it,
he was just talking...
- you told him you were
writing about him, right?
- I know, but...
i'm putting the guy's
life out there.
I just wanna feel
clean about it.
You know what i'm sayin'?
- I remember clean.
- Obviously,
they're not in a hurry
To go public
'cause we ain't cuffed.
- They're pretending on this
case like we're pretending.
Why?
- Carcetti.
He's exposed on this.
- How? Just blame it all on us,
on the department.
- To kill us, they'd
have to kill rawls, daniels,
And half the chain
of command.
And he made those guys.
It's his police department.
So he opens himself
up right when he's out
There running for governor.
- So they want us
to do what?
Run this thing down quietly?
That's no problem.
- Six months from now,
after the election,
They might decide to open up
and grand jury us.
We could still go to jail,
and if not,
I'd expect to be back
in the pawn shop unit
And you, my brother,
are gonna ride the boat.
- So what?
It was worth it.
Wasn't it?
- Depends.
Are they gonna let
the case against marlo
And his people stand,
knowing what they know?
- Why wouldn't they?
It still works on the
seizures and cell phones.
It works without
the illegal tap.
- Yeah, it does.
And they made a big deal
about dropping marlo.
They called that press
conference
And linked him to
all the bodies.
- For them to drop
the case now...
- you know, you think
about it...
we've got almost as much
on them as they do on us.
- That tom wolfe wannabe
thinks he's gonna
Get a phrase like that
past me?
No fuckin' way,
motherfucker.
- It's like a sweater with
the threads hanging off.
Pull any thread...
mostly exaggerations
and too-Perfect quotes,
Sometimes on-The-Record.
I called some of them back,
Asked if they really
said those things.
You know what the city
housing commissioner told me
About the quotes in
the flipping story?
- Hmm?
- He wished he'd said
some of them,
But that he'd never been
that smart in his life.
Somee takes
the time to...
re-Report this stuff,
it'll get ugly.
What're you gonna do?
- I don't know, robert.
I don't know.
- Keep my name out of it.
- No bail.
They're claiming a
propensity for violence and
Witness intimidation at
the bail review,
Trying to have you held
as the kingpin.
- They can do that?
- They can try.
Depends on which
judge they draw.
- So they ain't got no
bail for chris, right?
I mean, he got the
murder warrant.
- Monk neither.
Too much weight in his car
and he's on parole from
The '04 charge.
Best i could do was spring
mr. Wagstaff on 300,000.
- He show that kind
of money?
- Put up his uncle's house
on surety bond
For a third of it.
Bondsman is fronting
the rest on a fake lien.
Right now, the important
thing is not bail,
The important thing
is this...
i need you to tell me who
else knew your clock code.
- I told you.
Me, cheese, monk, chris
and the supply. That's it.
- No one else.
- No one else even had
my cell number.
Except you.
What?
- There's a lie
in here somewhere.
- I ain't lyin'.
- I don't mean you.
Look, the police say
a source told them
That you were re-Upping
on the day,
And word of that
might have slipped out.
That's possible.
I mean, if you were
wholesaling all over town...
but they only grab your
cells when they arrest you
And then they have to
go get warrants
Before they can look at
the photos on the phones.
And it's only when they
get to the photos
And break the code
That they have enough to
type a charging document
For you or chris, right?
I mean, you aren't
caught with drugs.
But they had the arrest
warrants on both of you
Within a couple hours.
Which means that they broke
the code almost instantly,
In no time at all.
- They wiretapped me.
- My investigator
thinks so.
But he says he doesn't
know for sure which
Unit ran the tap,
or who manned it.
It doesn't add up.
- You gettin' out.
You ain't.
You hit the streets,
you round up as much
Muscle as possible
and get that boy.
- He did snoop cuz
he knew we was on him.
- He knew we was on him cuz
he the one talked about
The damn re-Up.
Get your shit together,
man.
The bondsman came in
with levy.
- A'ight. I'm on it.
- Hey, man, you got a dollar?
C'mon.
- Hey, pal.
Hey.
Hey.
Pal, you all right?
- Okay, here it comes...
the dreaded crab claw.
You know what happens
when crab claw goes...
it's all crab tonight...
- No crab claw!
- Yes, crab claw!
Yeah!
Crab claw does it again.
Six!
Six and i'm out...
yeah?
Where?
You're fucking kidding me.
It's more bull...
it's bogus, jay.
I'm telling you...
okay.
I gotta go.
I have to keep
running the string out.
I have no choice.
- You said
the bosses know.
- Yeah.
Some do, some don't.
The ones that do
want us to keep pretending.
We stop pretending,
then...
listen, we'll finish
this tomorrow night, okay?
I'll see you in a bit.
- What do you think?
I mean, puttin' my shit
in the streets, huh?
- Well, it's you.
He's got you.
- Yeah, well...
- i mean he's got
what you're about.
The guy likes you,
that shows through.
I mean, you know,
he's saying this giving
Back that you're doing,
he's putting
That up against sherrod.
And he ain't lettin' you
off the hook for shit, but...
he's just puttin'
it all out there.
You know, the good
and the bad.
- Know what?
The bad don't bother me
to have out there.
Shit, i know the bad.
I ain't lyin' to no one
about the bad.
- Scared of somebody
callin' you good?
- A lot of folks
volunteer places.
A lot of people
share at meetings.
Plenty of motherfuckers
wake up every day
And not get high.
Man makin' me sound special
for doin' what the fuck
I need to be doin'.
- Read it, sucka.
- "You can hold back from
the suffering of the world,
"You have free
permission to do so,
"And it is in accordance
with your nature,
"But perhaps this very
holding back is the one
Suffering you could
have avoided."
Fan-Zee kafka.
Who's he?
- Some writer.
- You read his books?
- Fuck no.
But you remember flubber?
He handed that to me
the night that
He had me start leading
the saint martin meeting.
I kept it ever since.
- What it mean to you?
- You want these?
- Yeah, my man say he
need it back and
Not to make any copies.
He sayin' he ain't
supposed to show it
To me before it goes
in the paper.
I mean, if i let him.
- You gonna?
- Thanks for the crabs.
- Yep.
- Gray van.
You get the tag?
- I couldn't see it
from where i was.
- Describe the driver.
- White. Six foot.
Not heavy,
not skinny either.
- Clothes?
- Nothing i noticed.
Kinda non-Descript.
- Non-Descript?
- I was surprised, i guess.
I ju thought, whoa,
what's he doing?
- Funny it bein'
you to see this.
- It's weird. If an interview
doesn't run late,
I'm not even here tonight.
You mind if i get inside?
I gotta check in with my desk.
You need anything else,
you got my number.
- Yeah.
- That guy's an asshole.
This smokehound
can't remember a thing.
Only motherfucker he
remembers messin'
With him is the fella
that found him.
Whatever happened before
that is anyone's guess.
- Hey.
Someone try to kidnap you?
Drag you into a van?
- Ok.
- Who was trying to hurt you?
- My father.
But he was a drunk.
- Detective,
there's a vagrant over here
- What did you see, fella?
- Mcnulty?
Johnny weaver. Tactical.
- Fuck you.
Why didn't you say so?
- J.W.
Tryin' to keep your cover,
huh?
It's better for everyone
down here thinks i'm
One of the regulars,
right?
Anyway, what's the
ruckus with petey?
-The drunk?
- Yeah.
Sun reporter says he's
going into his building,
He sees a guy trying
to drag him into
A grey van.
It's bullshit, right?
- Yeah. Petey was layin'
there forty-Five minutes
Before that preppy cocksucker
even parks his car.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Hey, gimme a dollar,
make it look right.
- Thank you, johnny.
- What about the reporter?
You could charge
false statement, you know.
- You lock up every liar,
there's no room in b.D.C.
For anyone else, right?
More trouble than it's worth.
Jay, it's horseshit.
I'm goin' home.
Yeah.
- Brought home some crabs.
- I already made dinner.
- Put 'em in the fridge.
Cold for lunch tomorrow
if you like.
I can't eat 'em all.
- We don't run this shit,
especially not off the front.
- I saw what i saw.
- Alma is on the phone
with police p.I.O.
And they are telling us
on the record and off
That they are
discounting any report of
A possible abduction.
- That may be.
But that doesn't mean
they're doing their job,
And it doesn't mean
we shouldn't be--
- Our job is to report
the news,
Not to manufacture it.
- Nice.
- I know that they're
jealous of how much play
His stories get,
but the truth is...
- we cannot run this shit.
- Are you suggesting that
scott made any of this up?
- You ever notice that
the guys who do that...
the blairs, the glasses,
the kelleys.
They always start
with something small,
You know, just a little
quote that they clean up,
And then, then it's
a whole anecdote,
And pretty soon they're seeing
some amazing shit.
They're the lucky ones
who just happen
To be standing on the
right street corner
In tel aviv when
the pizza joint blows up
And the human head rolls
down the street
With the eyes still blinking.
- Those pictures were
sent to him.
The police have confirmed...
- it always starts
with something true,
Something confirmed.
But then you've got a
son of a bitch who just
Happens to be walking
in the guilford entrance
When the mysterious
gray van comes--
- Gus, this has gotten
personal between you and scott
And it's affecting
your judgment.
I'm moving the story
through the state desk.
You should go home,
think this through.
We'll talk in the morning.
- Maybe you win a
pulitzer with this stuff.
And maybe you gotta
give it back.
- It's in my notes, gus.
Everything that happened.
Everything that guy said
when i got to him.
Every last word is
in my notes.
- Home earlier than
i thought.
- Yeah. Home.
- He hit again.
- Who did?
- Serial killer.
- Get a grip, motherfucker.
- You don't believe me?
Check out his left wrist.
- You fuckin' with me again,
bunk?
- Copycat.
Call mcnulty.
Get him down here.
- Ronnie.
- Maury.
- Been going over the
charging documents on the
Partlow-Stanfield drug arrests.
Problematic to say the least.
- How so?
- They grab the phones
and minutes later
They've cracked an
elaborate code that
Implicates everyone.
No one's that brilliant.
Not in the b.P.D.
Anyway.
- You don't know
lester freamon.
- I know what i know.
And this feels to me
like an illegal wiretap.
Your guys were up on those
phones and tracking
My clients long before
they went near any drugs.
- Untrue.
- We get into discovery and
i'm going to have no problem
Knocking down that bullshit
about a source of information.
And my sources around here
tell me that with all
The budget cutbacks,
the only wiretap
You all have
had up this year
Has been on
the homeless killer thing.
Whatever else you're
running is illegal.
- Sources?
Title threes are supposed
to be secret, maury.
Are you saying you have
a source of information
Inside the courthouse?
- It's a figure of speech.
What i'm saying is that
there's shit in the
Blood of your case.
And if you wait until this
goes past indictments,
I'm gonna run wild with it.
We should talk.
Out of court.
- Oh, fuck me.
- Is it enough?
Do you have enough?
- It has to be.
It should be.
I mean, you can't look
at everything that robert
Found at the pattern,
And not see what this
fucking guy's about.
You know that.
I know that.
What you don't think so?
- I think that if you do this,
These son of a bitches
will do you.
- Come.
- Sorry. There's been another
homeless murder.
South baltimore.
- Careful, gus.
I can't protect you.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- No fucking way.
- Dead for a while.
And i can assume, jimmy,
From the fact that
the ribbon ain't red
And the simple fact
that you don't need
Another body because
marlo is locked up...
- i got nothing
to do with this.
- Wonderful.
We've eliminated
one suspect.
You see what you
started here?
- The bosses are gonna
toss it back to you,
No doubt.
- The bosses know
it's bullshit.
- What?
- Daniels knows.
Pearlman, too.
- How the fuck you...
how much longer does this...
- Can you give us a minute?
- You turning the world
upside down with your bullshit.
How are you not in jail?
- I don't know.
The lie's so big, people
can live with it, i guess.
- Jesus fucking christ, jimmy.
I told you.
I fuckin' told you it was
going to come to this.
You played with fire,
didn't you?
And now we're all
getting burned...
- reporting live
from south baltimore
Where police have found the body
of what appears to be
Another homeless man.
This one killed and left
in a vacant lot...
...short while ago
have refused so far...
- did somebody not
get the message?
- You're not killing
them yourself, mcnulty.
At least assure me of that.
And the one you disappeared.
- He's okay, last i checked.
- Good. That's a start...
i guess.
- I thought you got
a message.
- Copycat.
I got nothing on this one.
- Jesus.
- How did you do it?
How did you get 'em by
the medical examiner?
- Some were real and
i just linked 'em
With the ribbons.
Some i juk as
strangle jobs.
If it matters, i know now...
- fuck what you know now.
This was all for money,
mcnulty?
You couldn't live
without the o.T.?
- The stanfield case.
It was that.
- I know where it went,
but you got paid, too.
You and freamon and
maybe a dozen other guys.
- It wasn't about the money.
- Down the road,
when we settle on this--
And we will settle on this--
I don't expect any of you
will ever see another hour
Of o.T. Again.
I don't expect any of
you will be doing
Police work ever again.
And the only reason
this isn't before a
Grand jury right now
is because our mayor
Can't live with that.
Oh, yeah.
The mayor knows your name.
- So this is your last case.
Work it.
- If you're half the
detective you think you are,
You'll put this one down
fast and take us all
Off the hook.
The longer this goes on,
The worse the payback's
gonna be.
The worse the payback's
gonna be.
- But what does he
really know?
- What he knows now isn't
half of what he'll learn
When we get to discovery.
They won't be able to
produce a credible source
Of information...
- they don't have to if
it's not a registered c.I.
A source of information
is only--
- If he can raise doubts
in a judge's mind,
We could be compelled
to reveal our source.
At that point,
we're giving up the wiretap.
- And he gets the paperwork
from the phone company...
- which has stanfield's
number on it.
- God.
- The only thing we
can do is barter.
- Then barter.
This can't go to court.
- We do have some leverage.
- What?
- Let's just say mr. Levy
has problems of his
Own to deal with.
- Make this go away...
and the mayor will not
forget that you did so.
Nor will i.
Jimmy, ass up an'
help with this.
- Shit is funky.
- Aw, man, we should take
this into the box.
- Where's the
pocket contents?
- We have questions
about the report
Of the kidnapping...
- those two bags there.
- Yes, ma'am.
Well, that would seem to
be the newspaper's problem.
I get another fucking
call about a gray van
And i'm burning that
fucking newspaper building
To the ground.
- Huh.
- What?
- Your homeless guy
from days ago.
What was in his pockets?
- Bullshit.
- You got business cards?
- Yeah, but every card
has an alibi.
- Let me see.
- I thought we
were done with this.
So, where you going with this?
- Motherfucker,
you ain't that good.
- Mcnulty,
what's up with this?
- You okay, gus?
- Hmmm?
Yeah, i'm great.
What?
Alma, what's up?
- It's empty.
- What's empty?
- The pad he waved at you,
Saying it was all
filled with notes.
It's empty. Every page.
- Thanks.
- What the fuck
is that about?
Uh-Oh.
Alma, t.V. Has police
on a sweep of the homeless
Under hanover street.
- I'll get right
to the point.
- Please do.
- Maury, hey.
- Yeah, hi.
- You have stanfield, right?
He's your client?
- Yeah, him and his people.
- Well, i have some stuff,
straight from the grand jury
That you're gonna wanna
see sooner rather than later.
- Is this a title
three case?
- You're gonna
find it interesting, i promise.
- All right.
When can you meet?
- Tomorrow, after work.
Same money, right?
- Yeah, the money's the same.
- Good.
- We can grand jury
gary dipasquale tomorrow,
Along with that
one-Party consent call.
Or...here's the deal.
No court trials.
Partlow pleads to all of
the bodies in the vacants
And takes life,
no parole.
We'd want the
second shooter too,
But pearson's
beyond that now.
Metcalf and wagstaff plead
to possession with intent.
Stanfield takes ten years
on conspiracy.
- You're blackmailing
an officer of the court.
The moment you came in here
and offered that quid pro quo
You were guilty of
obstruction of justice.
- You're right.
I could get six to
eight years.
And for bribery of a state's
attorney and the violation
Of grand jury secrecy,
you could see ten to twelve.
I'll be out a couple
years before you, maury.
You come home,
first round's on me, i guess.
- So you'll let me walk
to keep this case out of
Open court?
That file must be dirty
as hell. Huh?
The conspiracy charge
on stanfield falls
Without the cell phones,
and you and i both know
That if someone does
some digging,
They're gonna find an
illegal wiretap and
You're gonna lose
the phones.
- Everhart, two-Seventy-Four,
Maryland four-Fifty-Nine.
Or ceccolini,
four-Thirty-Five,
U.S. Two-Sixty-Eight.
Lying cops don't
automatically kill a case.
- But that's a lot of risk
on appeal...
and a lot of dirt for
your office to show.
No.
You're scared
of the light.
Partlow takes his chances
on the legit murder charge only.
The conspiracy count
goes and stanfield
And the rest walk.
- Stanfield walks.
But the case goes on
the stet docket,
Not dismissed outright.
And although i can tell
you there are people
In this city who can't
tolerate a scandal at
This particular moment,
that dynamic changes
After november.
- The elections...
- after november,
no one is going to care
As much about showing dirt.
If carcetti wins,
he's in annapolis.
If he loses,
he's an incumbent mayor
Who can take a hit or two.
So you tell
mr. Stanfield that this
Is his only window.
Partlow pleads to all
the murders
And both lieutenants
plead to the drugs.
Then stanfield retires.
He's done.
We even get the scent of him
on the street ever again,
This case comes off stet
and goes to trial.
And if we have to put
a few cops in jail
Right behind him, so be it.
We'll bring the evidence
and take a hit.
Your client walks
away now...
or the both of you
don't walk at all.
- Let's go. Get up.
- That's mine.
- It's yours. I know.
- Do you have a card?
That's not a card.
- We met before,
you remember?
- Liar.
Black liar.
- Why'd you kill
your friend?
- He drinks...
he's always drinking.
- But you put a
ribbon around his wrist.
Like the others.
- Yeah.
- Did you see that
on television?
The ribbon on the wrist?
Did you hear about that
from other people?
Why'd you do the thing
with the ribbon?
- Nobody understands.
You don't understand.
I always know what
i'm going to do...
before i do it. Okay?
I always know what
i'm going to do.
- Did you kill the others?
Did you kill all of them?
- Every one of them.
I did it because i knew
i was going to do it.
I've killed millions.
Okay?
And they all killed me.
- So you did all
the murders, huh?
- You're a coward.
I can tell.
Hey, do you have
a card?
- Jimmy, reporter's in there
waiting for a photo array.
- What?
Jay, he's bullshit.
- I know he is.
But the newspaper made
such a fuss the major
Wants us to jerk him off,
just to say we did.
- Hey, detective.
Um...
- no gray van either.
- W-What...
- he doesn't have a grey van.
No gray van.
And he didn't call you
on the phone either, did he?
He didn't call you
the first time
And he didn't call
you the second.
I did that.
Yew mortify me
in fronta my fatha...
and those pictures y got.
I took those.
And the missing guy?
He's my second cousin.
We sent him up to atlantic city
with a roll of quarters.
And you know why i can
tell you all this?
Because,
you lyin' motherfucker,
You're as full
of shit as i am,
And you've got to live
with it and play it out
For as long as it goes.
Right?
Trapped in the same lie.
Only difference is
i know why i did it...
and fuck if i can
figure out what it gets you
In the end.
But hey, i ain't part
of your tribe.
- You're not serious...
you can't...
- no.
No, i'm a fucking joke...
and so are you.
Now get the fuck
out of here.
- You walk.
Chris eats the murders,
every last one,
Takes life with no parole.
- No parole?
- No shot.
But they've got him cold
on the one with the d.N.A.
Can you sell that?
Is chris loyal?
- Yeah.
As long as i take care
ofis people.
- Cheese and monk are
looking at up to twenty
For the drugs.
But there's gonna be no
assets investigation
And you come home
with all your money.
- Why they letting me walk?
- They don't want to,
but there's some shit
In their case and
they'd rather not show
It in court.
But here's the rub:
If you stay in the game,
They will.
They definitely will.
Right now, with an
election going on,
They're willing to
give you a buy.
But after november,
if they even think
You're still a player,
they can take this case
Down off the shelf and
the shit in the case
Might not be enough
to keep you free.
Do you understand?
- Give up the crown.
- Well, that's the deal,
kiddo.
There's not a lawyer who
could get better for you.
- How'd that go, boss?
- Kiddo, you are a goldmine
to me. You know that?
You've taken this law firm
to a whole new level.
- Me?
- You don't tip me to
that bad wiretap,
I've got all kinds
of trouble.
But now, if marlo
takes the deal,
He's gonna get a walk
after being charged
In a multimillion
dollar drug seizure.
That doesn't happen
very often,
And when it does happen,
the name and number
Of the defense attorney
goes in the front
Pocket of every respectable
drug trafficker.
You're a genius for what
you brought me on this.
- I'm just doin'
what i do, right?
You need to know something,
all you gotta do is ask.
That's what a detective is,
right?
- Here.
You should come over
for dinner tonight.
Yvette's making brisket.
- Your house?
- You're mishpucha now.
- If you say so.
- It's down.
- Not that this thing
is ever going to trial.
Guy has n.C.R. Written
all over him.
- Can't argue.
A padded room at clifton t.
Perkins is definitely
Called for.
- He go for all of them?
- No, sir.
Just the last two.
- He deny the others?
- He ain't exactly
denying anything in there.
I mean, he'll cop to
anything we damn please...
- then go back and get it.
- Excuse me?
If he's n.C.,
what the fuck is
The difference if he
cops to two or six?
Either way, they tie his
arms and feed him green jell-O.
- Sir, he did the last two.
- Motherfucker,
you are a cunt hair away
Fromndictment and you
see fit to argue with me?
- I did what i did.
I know.
And now, i'm standing
responsible for two fresh
murders.
I know what
i've done here.
But i'm not doing this.
- This is over.
And all of our citizens
can rest soundly
In the knowledge that
the man responsible
Has been apprehended
by the diligent
Efforts of investigators.
- Mr. Mayor,
is he being charged with
All of the murders,
or just two...
- um, it is my
understanding that, uh...
- uh, we are charging
the last two incidents,
But it is my
understanding that
He is suspected in
all of the crimes.
And we're waiting for
dna test results.
Indications are that he
may be mentally incapacitated
And therefore
additional prosecutions would
Prove redundant.
- I'd also like to credit
deputy commissioner for
Operations daniels
with not only bringing these
Cases to their
proper conclusion,
But but also for solving
last year's slayings
In the vacant rowhouses.
He has given us such
excellent work that
I think that now is as good
a time as any to announce
That we will be sending
the deputy's name forward
To the city council
for confirmation as
Baltimore police commissioner.
Acting commissioner rawls,
to whom i am also
Extremely grateful,
will serve in an
Advisory capacity pending
new responsibilities
At city hall.
- Scott, you should be
working the main bar
On the arrest with alma.
- I am...
- we're going to want
your byline in this coverage.
- Yeah, i don't feel
so wel
My stomach...
i think i gotta go home.
Sorry.
- Having ducked the bullet
on that homeless mess,
I want you to know that
the mayor and i both
Appreciate your discretion.
But right now we can't
take our eyes off
The ball when it comes
to crime overall...
looking at your weekly
u.C.R.S from the districts,
I am not seeing the kind
of decline that's going
To measure out to a ten
percent drop in the quarter.
- They're clean.
- Excuse me.
- The stats are clean.
They're gonna stay clean.
Either we fix this
police department
And the crime goes down,
or we don't
And the crime stays up.
- Commissioner, we're
talking about a little help
In the next couple quarters.
That's all...
- no. I can't.
- You're quiet on
the homeless fiasco,
But this makes
you squeal?
What the--
- Tell the mayor his
stats will be clean.
Before the election,
after the election...
- you're right.
They can't fire you.
Not without it bouncing
back on city hall.
If you don't mind being
buried in some backroom unit,
You can stay for as
long as you can stand it.
Or until you get the pension.
But at the same time,
i can't let you do police work.
Not anything that's
going to find its way
Into a courtroom.
I won't do that.
For both of you,
that's over.
- So marlo walks.
- Or you go to jail.
- And you couldn't do
any better with levy, huh?
I mean, giving up
the money...
- i got what i could.
You lost the money trail,
lester,
When you decided to start
coloring outside of the lines.
This isn't on me.
- What the fuck you mean
you selling?
- I'm sellin' the connect.
- How much, yo?
- Ten million.
- Goddamn.
- Or a high bidder if
i hear ten from more
Than one of y'all.
If you all think it
ain't worth that,
I stick that shit back
in my pocket and y'all
Can go back to runnin'
that stepped-On new york shit.
- You don't mind me askin',
why you sellin'?
I mean, even from inside
here, you can take a slice
For just layin'
in the cut, nigga.
- I ain't gonna be
in here long.
Case they got against me
already fallin' apart.
But the truth is,
I'm done with this
gangsta shit.
I've been there,
done that.
- You somethin' else
other than a gangsta?
- Businessman.
Yeah, tall man,
i can't get that shit wrapped
Around my head neither.
Anyway, y'all can't get
my price up,
Maybe y'all pool your money.
But supply only gonna deal
with y'all after
I make the intro.
Then i'm out.
- You've got a problem.
I thought daniels was
your boy.
- We've both got a problem
if crime doesn't drop.
Carcetti loses the
statehouse and you aren't mayor.
And even if he wins,
nerese, you're stuck with
A police commissioner
that won't work with you.
- Oh, i'm not stuck
with anything.
Daniels either comes
around or he's done.
- We just anointed him.
We can't go back
on that now. He knows it.
- Either he learns his place
or he'll be offering to resign.
Oh, you ain't the only one
knows how to play this game.
- What to say about
this piece of work?
Fuck if i don't find
myself without the right words.
Me, as gifted a golden throat
as any of you cocksuckers,
Being loosed from religion,
are ever likely to hear.
What can i say about
the dearly departed?
I mean, really...
- he died young. Too young.
- Not even forty years old.
- Though had it lived,
his dick woulda been
A hundred and thirty-Four...
- shut up.
It's coming to me...
he was the black sheep,
the permanent pariah.
He asked no quarter of
the bosses and none was given.
He learned no lessons,
he acknowledged no mistakes,
He was as stubborn a mic
as ever stumbled out of
The northeast parishes to
take a patrolman's shield.
He brooked no authority.
He did what he
wanted to do
And he said what he
wanted to say
And in the end,
he gave you the clearances.
He's natural police.
Yes, he was.
And i don't say that
about many people.
Even when they're here
on the felt,
I don't give that one up
unless it happens to be true.
Natural poh-Leece.
But christ,
what an asshole.
And i'm talkin' about
the ordinary,
Gaping orifice that
all of us possess.
I mean an all-Encompassing,
all-Consuming,
Out of proportion to every
other facet of his
Humanity chasm.
From whose borne,
if i may quote shakespeare,
No traveler has ever returned.
- The fuck did i do?
- Shut the fuck up.
You're dead to us now.
- Hey, hey...
- ho, here's his
partner in crime.
- Now, now. Be gentle.
Be gentle.
I'm a civilian now.
Be gentle.
- Your papers went in,
huh?
- Yeah, this afternoon.
Thirty-Two years..
- And four months.
- Mmm mmm.
Y'all did a
fine job with him, you did.
He look to be about ten
years younger than i remember.
- C'mon, there's enough room
for both of you to be laid out.
- One at a time.
You don't crowd a man
at his own wake.
- Come on, lester?
Come and snuggle.
- Keep our secrets, jimmy.
I got shardene with me tonight.
- If you gentlemen
will spare us
This unfortunate
homoerotic lapse,
I will conclude my
elegiac remarks...
- then do it,
you gabby motherfucker...
- to conclude...
to conclude, i say...
he gave us thirteen
years on the line...
not enough for a pension...
but enough for us to
know that he was..
- Put the fucking
song on, hue...
- despite his negligible
irish ancestry...
his defects of
personality...
and his inconstant
sobriety and hygiene...
a true murder police.
Jimmy...
i say this seriously.
If i was laying there dead
on some baltimore street corner,
I'd want it to be you
standing over me,
Catching the case.
- Bullshit.
- Because, brother,
when you were good,
You were the best we had.
- Shit, if you was layin'
there dead on some corner,
It was probably jimmy
that done ya.
- Fuck you!
If you caught the case,
you'd be standing there
Pissin' in my ear.
- How did nerese campbell
get it?
- You think i asked?
Do you think it even matters?
She gave it to me because
she thought you'd listen to me.
- So now they want
me to go.
- The way she expressed it
is that she wanted you
To stay if you could come
to your senses.
- Come to my senses.
She wants me to juke
the stats for carcetti.
This quarter and the next...
hide the crime,
get him elected as governor
And make her the mayor.
- So do it.
Burrell juked
them before you.
Warren frasier
before him.
And after you're gone,
rawls or whoever
Will juke them. So what?
- I'll swallow a lie
when i have to.
I've swallowed a few
big ones lately.
But the stat games...
that lie, it's what ruined
this department.
Shining up shit and
calling it gold,
So majors become colonels
and mayors become governors.
Pretending to do police work
while one generation fucking
Trains the next how not
to do the job.
And that...
i looked carcetti
in the eye.
I shook his hand.
I asked him if
he was for real.
This is the lie
i can't live with.
If i do, then nerese has me
in her pocket whenever
She wants me.
And i'm no good to
anyone like that.
- Then go.
Withdraw for personal reasons,
or health reasons.
Whatever.
You've got your law degree.
You're not going to starve.
But if you don't go,
they'll wreck both of us.
- There's not enough
in here to indict me.
And the joke of it is,
i've seen enough
The last few days to have
them indicted.
- For what?
Then use it, cedric.
Or at least threaten to.
- People will get hurt.
People i care about.
- Then you're done.
There's enough in that file
that you'll never make
It through
confirmation hearings.
And enough so that my
career is dead before it
Even gets started.
The tree that doesn't bend,
breaks, cedric.
- Bend too far,
you're already broken.
- Marlo on a walk.
And the money, jimmy.
She gave that away, too.
- Yeah.
- We don't get to
follow the money.
Hey...
wonderin' where you was...
- didn't know if i should
come out on this here...
- why the fuck not?
- Was me who told daniels.
I didn't want to do
it behind your back,
But it had to be done.
Anyway, it was great bein'
on the job with y'all.
I just wanted to say
that too, i guess.
- So what?
You ain't gonna drink
with me?
- I am if you want...
- detective, if you think
it needed doin',
I guess it did.
- You comin'?
- Milton came
with six hundred.
An' little glen is
in for three.
- I got five from me
An' i got five from
chinaman to cover.
- I can go that.
No thing.
- What?
Motherfucker, where you get
that kind of scratch?
- You don't think cheese
know this here game?
We sellin' dope an' coke
in baltimore, nigga,
Any of y'all ain't got
that kind of money
Need be ashamed.
- You still puttin' up more
than your share with that.
- The way i look at it,
we all gonna be more
Than paid once we own
the connect, so...
- shit, nigga,
we was good when
Your uncle had it.
You had to go ahead and
put up with marlo...
- see that.
See now, that's just the
wrong way to look at it.
'Cause joe had his time
and omar put an end to that,
Then marlo had his time,
short as it was,
An' the police put
an end to that.
And now, motherfucker,
it's our time.
Mines and yours.
But instead of just
shuttin' up and kickin' in,
You gonna stand there cryin'
that back-In-The-Day shit.
- Cheese...
- there ain't no back
in the day, nigga.
Ain't no nostalgia
to this shit here.
There's just the street
and the game
And what happen here today.
- You right.
- When it was my uncle,
i was with my uncle.
When it was marlo,
i was with him.
But now, nigga--
- What the fuck
did you do that for?
Now we short the nine.
- That was for joe.
- This sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.
- This sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.
- This sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.
- This sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.
- This sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.
- This sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.
- This sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.
- This sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.
- Hey, alma...
i just heard.
- The carroll
county bureau?
That's how they
punish me?
Why not just send my ass
all the way to pennsylvania?
- What'd they tell you?
- That i did an excellent job.
That this had nothing to do
with anything but trying
To make the county
bureaus stronger.
- Alma, i didn't tell
them about the notepad.
I left that part out.
- I told them.
When i heard you were
in trouble,
I went to whiting,
told him i thought you
Were right about scott.
I told him about the notepad.
Did he make all of it up?
The calls from the killer?
The pictures?
- Some, not all.
- Why?
- Look around.
The pond is shrinking.
The fish are nervous.
Get some profile,
win a prize...
maybe find a bigger
pond somewhere.
Whiting, klebanow, templeton...
they snatch a pulitzer or two,
and they are up
And gone from this place.
For them, that's what
this is all about.
Me?
I'm too fuckin'
simple-Minded for that.
I just wanted to see
something new every day...
and write a
story with it.
Alma, you'll write
your way outta carroll
In no time, watch.
- About as fast
as you edit
Your way off the copy
desk, huh?
- Congratulations,
sergeant goette.
I know you'll do well
in the eastern.
Glad i got to do
this at least.
Congratulations,
lieutenant carver.
- Thank you, sir.
I'm just sorry it won't
be you i'm serving under.
- Word gets around, huh?
- It's on w.B.A.L. Today.
They said you're leaving
for family reasons...
- i guess i got some kids
somewhere i don't
Even know about.
They say on b.A.L.
Who they're sending up
As acting commissioner?
- Say it ain't so.
- Ladies and gentlemen,
As what may be my
last official act
As a baltimore
police officer,
Allow me to congratulate all
of the promoted officers,
Their families,
their fellow officers,
And their friends.
- You ain't careful,
they may make you major.
Then you'll be truly fucked.
Good job.
- Thanks.
- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks.
- See now,
there you go
Givin' a fuck when it
ain't your turn
To give a fuck.
Lehman's squad was up.
- I needed the o.T.
- Yeah, an' now
you got a shooting with no wits,
No suspect and no prayer
of it goin' to black.
Pickin' up the phone like
a goddamn rookie.
Shame on you.
- Stop squealin' like a bitch.
An' make sure you don't step
on that shell casing behind you.
- I ain't gonna kick no
shell casings behind me.
It's right there on the side.
I'm gonna step back and kick
no damn shell casing
You don't mark with letters
and numbers.
- I understand.
And you gotta be in the system.
They sent you the form.
- They told me that
wasn'tood enough.
They said they wanted
the other paper work.
- And you said you applied
for s.S.I., mr. Belton?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Well, let's go
inside and look it up on
The computer.
- Hey, you remember me?
I brought this guy in
a few weeks back,
I just wanted to see
how he was...
- he wandered out after
a couple nights.
Sorry.
- Where...
where do the homeless
go around here?
- Different places.
Down by the river,
over in the
Warehouse district...
some of the places,
i don't really think
It would be safe
for you to go...
- i'm police.
Well, i used to be.
- Wait here.
I'll see if i
can find you a map.
- Thanks.
- Come on, mr. Belton.
- And if the major could find
his ass with his hand,
He'd know that this we have
more than enough for us
To be up on a pen register.
Lieutenant carver told him so,
but fuck if he isn't trying
To shut this thing down.
All's i'm sayin' is a
phone call or two and
You're gonna find out
that they're gettin'
Some kinda pressure from
somewhere to sit on this thing,
Even though we've tied
three killings to this crew.
- Does the police
commissioner know?
- Him?
He wouldn't know police
work if it took down his
Front door on a warrant.
Just...
keep my name out of it.
- New westport is like
howard street ten years ago,
Except the land's cheaper
and there's more potential
For mixed-Use because of
the waterfront location.
- There you are.
- You can't put a price
on a waterview.
- Oh, yes, you can.
You definitely can.
- Andy, he's gotta meet
tommy and they're leaving early,
So let me borrow him
for a moment.
- Sure, no problem.
Nice to meet you,
mr. Stanfield.
- You know who you
were talking to?
- Nah.
- Andy krawczyk.
Very connected.
Very big with development
around the harbor.
He's someone you're
gonna wanna know well,
But kid, do not...
do not get in a room
with him alone.
You want me in there with you,
believe me.
Otherwise, guys like that
will bleed you...
i want you to meet tommy
flanagan before he leaves...
- yeah, gimme a minute.
I need to, um...
- bathroom?
- Yeah.
- Down the hall to the right.
Hey, watch that stuff.
You'll put on weight.
- But next time,
i want you to make sure
That you watch this money...
- uh-Uh. Don't...
umm-Uh. Don't do it.
Time to give that up.
- Do you know who i am?
- Name's vinson.
Used to be marlo's bank,
but marlo ain't 'round no more,
And you still movin' money
for other players so...
i'm thinkin' some of that
money need to be mine.
- Shit...
you just a boy.
That's just your knee.
- That motherfucker shot me.
- Nice doin' business,
gentlemen.
- No way, that's bullshit.
I heard it different.
The real story about omar
Is that a bunch of cops
made it look like them
New york boys killed him.
But it was them.
They're the ones that
really killed him.
- Listen, motherfucker,
I know what happened to him.
Them police had nothing
to do with it.
No new york boys neither.
So omar's got an a.K.,
right?
But he's surrounded.
It's like eight,
nine motherfuckers up there
And they all got nines.
But he like,
"you all think you..."
- Fuck you lookin' at?
- You, nigga.
- You know who i am?
- Nigga, you know
who i am?
- Oh, shit!
- Yeah...
- on me, all right?
- Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
This is a great day for
democrats and it's a
Great day for maryland.
- Hey, zorzi.
I hope i get this by e-Dot.
- Okay, three minutes,
for christ's sake.
Don't get your
panties in a knot.
- Commissioner valchek.
- Madam prosecutor,
Gentlemen...
first case up and
i have to recuse myself.
- Your honor,
i appreciate your concern.
- Congratulations,
superintendent.
Welcome aboard.
- Thank you, governor.
Happy to be aboard.
- Thank you.
Larry...
let's go home.

- Alors, comment il s'appelle ?
- Morveux.
- T'as dit Morveux ?
- Ouais, c'est ça.
"Morveux."
Ça lui plaît ?
- Quoi ?
- Morveux.
Ce type que sa mère s'est fait chier
à appeler Omar lsaiah Betts ?
Tu sais, il oublie sa veste...
son nez se met à couler et un connard,
au lieu de lui passer un Kleenex,
l'appelle "Morveux".
Et voilà, il est baptisé.
C'est vraiment pas juste.
Faut croire que c'est la vie.
Alors, qui a tué Morveux ?
Je ne vais pas au tribunal.
Quand même,
cet enculé aurait pas dû le tuer.
C'est très vrai.
Il aurait pu lui casser la gueule,
comme on fait d'habitude.
- Je suis bien d'accord.
- Et il tue Morveux.
Morveux fait les mêmes trucs
depuis des années.
Tuer un mec pour des conneries.
Tous les vendredis soirs,
dans la ruelle derrière le magasin discount,
on joue aux dés.
Avec les gars du quartier,
on joue toute la nuit.
Un jeu de quartier, hein ?
Et chaque fois,
Morveux venait lancer les dés.
Il jouait jusqu'à ce qu'il y ait une cagnotte,
puis il se cassait avec.
- Chaque fois ?
- Il pouvait pas s'en empêcher.
Que je te comprenne.
Tous les vendredis soirs,
toi et tes potes, vous jouez aux dés.
Et tous les vendredis soirs,
ton pote Morveux
attendait qu'il y ait de l'argent sur la table
et puis se cassait avec en courant ?
- Vous le laissiez faire ?
- On lui cassait la gueule.
Mais personne est jamais allé plus loin.
Laisse-moi te poser une question.
Si Morveux se tirait
chaque fois avec l'argent,
pourquoi vous le laissiez jouer ?
Quoi ?
Si Morveux volait toujours l'argent,
pourquoi le laissiez-vous jouer ?
Fallait bien. On est en Amérique.

HEURE
"... quand c'est pas ton tour."
-- McNulty
- Devine ce qu'il dit.
- Quoi ?
"Fallait bien, on est en Amérique."
Sans déconner.
- J'inventerais ça ?
- Il a donné le tueur ?
Trois clopes et un soda
qu'il va devant le jury.
C'est sûr, Bunk.
Barksdale est à la section 1 2, c'est ça ?
Un meurtre dans le Westside.
- Lequel ?
- Laisse tomber.
Je vais regarder un peu. Tu seras où ?
Je vais passer ça à Nathan,
puis je vais au bureau.
- Ne réponds pas au téléphone, Bunk.
- C'est ça.
C'est votre signature
sur cette série de photos ?
Oui ?
Et ce sont vos initiales, à côté de la photo
que vous avez identifiée ?
Oui.
M. Gant, voyez-vous l'homme que vous avez
identifié sur cette série de photos
dans la salle d'audience ?
Il est là.
Pour le procès-verbal,
le témoin a identifié l'accusé,
D'Angelo Barksdale.
- Il est à vous.
- Merci.
Juste une question, M. Gant.
Aviez-vous déjà vu ce jeune homme
avant le jour en question ?
- Non.
- Pas d'autres questions, Votre Honneur.
Vous pouvez disposer, M. Gant.
Appelez le témoin suivant.
La Cour appelle Nakeisha Lyles,
Votre Honneur.
Jurez-vous de dire la vérité, toute la vérité
et rien que la vérité ?
Je le jure.
- Votre nom, madame ?
- Nakeisha Lyles.
- Avez-vous un emploi ?
- Oui.
- Quel est votre métier, Mme Lyles ?
- Je suis agent de sécurité.
Étiez-vous de service le 4 mai,
jour du meurtre ?
- Que faisiez-vous ce jour-là ?
- Je travaillais au 221 .
JE T'EMMERDE INSPECTEUR
Dans la guérite du hall
de la tour de l'avenue Fremont ?
Oui.
Vous étiez derrière une vitre pare-balles,
avec vue sur tout le hall ?
- Oui.
- Bien.
Mme Lyles,
je sais que ça risque d'être difficile,
mais dites-nous ce que vous avez vu.
Il y avait un homme
qui attendait l'ascenseur,
un autre type s'est mis
à lui casser la gueule,
et le type s'est effondré...
- La victime s'est effondrée ?
- Non, l'homme au pistolet.
L'homme qui s'est effondré avait un pistolet.
Est-ce qu'il est ici,
dans la salle d'audience ?
Non.
Pardon ?
Il n'est pas ici.
Vous ne...
Vous avez témoigné.
Vous souvenez-vous
quand l'inspecteur Barlow
vous a montré cette série de photos ?
- Oui.
- Bien.
Portez votre attention sur les initiales
qui identifient cette photo
comme étant celle de l'homme
qui a tiré sur M. Blanchard.
Avez-vous inscrit vos initiales
sur cette photo ?
C'est pas lui qui a tiré.
Mais vous l'avez identifié.
C'est parce qu'il ressemblait
au type qui l'a fait.
Celui-là, je l'ai vu dans l'immeuble
une semaine plus tard.
Vous avez vu quelqu'un d'autre
qui semblait être l'auteur du crime ?
Oui, une semaine plus tard.
Mme Lyles,
quand vous avez parlé aux inspecteurs,
vous n'avez jamais rien dit...
J'ai essayé. J'ai appelé l'inspecteur...
I'inspecteur Barlow le 13 mai à 14 h.
- Mais il ne m'a pas rappelée.
- Joli coup.
- Vous avez appelé l'inspecteur Barlow ?
- Oui, deux fois.
Je l'ai écrit dans le livre de bord.
- Je voudrais le prix du bois traité.
- 14 $.
C'est ça, le prix que t'allais me donner ?
Tu sens ça, Mikey ? Tu le sens ?
C'est ma bite dans ton oreille, je te le jure.
- Charmant.
- Quitte pas, espèce de voleur !
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
- T'es allé au tribunal ?
- Quoi ?
Ton dossier a capoté.
L'équipe de Barksdale l'a coulé.
Deux témoins oculaires et une déposition.
Impossible.
Écoute-moi, petit con,
il n'est pas question que je paie ça.
Non.
T'utilises ma putain de caisse
pour conduire ce connard.
- Du calme.
- Tu ne piges pas.
- J'ai fait tout ça pour lui et voilà.
- Ça sert à rien de s'énerver.
- Greggs, qu'est-ce qu'elle raconte ?
- C'est pas ce qu'elle dit.
Ouais ? Toi, tu dis quoi, alors ?
Je dis qu'on attend... Ducon.
- C'est lui.
- Bon, du calme.
- Herc, t'as vu ?
- Ouais, on voit.
- T'as la police au bout du fil ?
- En attente.
- C'est Ghost.
- Bien, Tiff.
Bon, explique-moi ce que je vois.
- Il va chercher le petit Mike.
- Et puis ?
Mike revient avec l'argent.
Attendez un peu,
chopez la voiture un peu plus loin.
- Je ne veux pas de poursuite à pied.
- Bien reçu.
Je l'ai.
Vas-y ! Je prends le conducteur.
Prends la maison à gauche.
À terre !
Lève-toi.
- Les mains derrière la tête.
- Les mains en l'air.
Éteins le moteur.
Va choper cet enculé au coin de la rue.
Les clés. Jette-les hors de la voiture.
Tout de suite. Sors de la voiture.
Allonge-toi ici.
Toi, passe les mains
par la fenêtre de la voiture.
Les deux mains par la fenêtre.
Avec ta main droite, ouvre la portière.
Doucement. Sors de la voiture.
Allonge-toi par terre.
C'est bon. Embarque-le au trou.
- Tu l'as eu, Carv ?
- Ouais.
- Regarde-moi ça.
- Les jambes croisées.
Regarde ça.
T'as vu ce qu'il a fait ? T'as vu ?
Il a jeté le flingue sur ma caisse !
Ça va érafler la peinture.
- Reste dans la voiture.
- Dis-lui de laisser ma caisse.
- Reste dans la voiture, bordel !
- C'est pas cool.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous avec un truc pareil ?
C'est quoi, ça ?
T'aurais dû voir
comment il me regardait, Kima.
Ce connard flippait tant
qu'il a failli chier dans son froc.
Hein ?
Deux flingues, tu te souviens ?
- Deux ?
- C'est bon, Kima, relax.
Levez-vous.
La section 1 2 du Tribunal correctionnel
de Baltimore est en séance.
Asseyez-vous.
Mme la présidente du jury,
le verdict est unanime ?
En ce qui concerne D'Angelo Barksdale,
que dites-vous de l'inculpation
d'homicide volontaire prémédité ?
Non coupable.
Que dites-vous de l'inculpation
d'homicide volontaire non prémédité ?
Non coupable.
Ouais !
- Ça, c'est du verdict.
- Asseyez-vous.
C'est ça !
- Tu leur auras donné du fil à retordre.
- Asseyez-vous.
Nous remercions le jury pour ses services.
Les policiers raccompagneront
l'accusé Barksdale en préventive
afin de procéder à sa libération.
Tu crois que ça me fait chier ?
Un jour, je trouverai ton cadavre.
- Bonne journée.
- Stringer, allons-y.
Inspecteur ?
Inspecteur. Le juge veut vous parler.
- Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
- On a perdu.
C'est toi qui étais dessus ?
- Sur l'affaire ?
- Ouais.
Non, c'était Barlow, avec l'aide de McLarney.
Si c'était Barlow,
pourquoi t'étais au tribunal ?
Comme ça.
T'aimes voir les affaires
sur lesquelles tu bosses même pas ?
Juste pour le plaisir ?
Quand on commence à jouir
avec ses clients,
il est temps d'arrêter.
Parle pas comme ça, t'es juge, maintenant.
Justement, je peux dire ce que je veux.
Ce Barksdale,
c'est un cousin d'Avon Barksdale.
- Qui ?
- Avon Barksdale, Stringer Bell.
Le gang qui fait la loi depuis un an
à la cité Franklin.
Stringer Bell ?
C'était celui avec le carnet et les lunettes,
au tribunal,
qui terrorisait tous les témoins.
Lui et son gang, Wee-Bey, Savino, Stinkum.
- Je les ai vus.
- T'as pensé à ordonner le huis clos ?
Sous quel prétexte ?
C'est un tribunal ouvert dans un pays libre.
Je croyais qu'on était à Baltimore.
Barksdale tient cinq tours sur sept
à la cité Franklin.
Ça fait 10 cages d'escalier dans cinq tours
pour trafiquer de la drogue.
Et je ne parle que des tours.
Il contrôle aussi les pavillons,
les coins de rues.
Comment le sais-tu ?
- Tout le monde le sait.
- Sois plus précis.
Tout le monde dans le Westside.
Barksdale et Bell,
c'est le cinquième pouvoir.
Ils ont tué 10 ou 1 2 personnes en un an.
Gagné trois procès en utilisant
la même méthode qu'aujourd'hui.
- Qui s'occupe d'eux ?
- Chez nous ?
Personne, vraiment.
On est déjà très occupés
avec les dealers de rue.
La police de proximité et tout ça.
Alors, si c'est pas ton affaire,
qu'est-ce que t'en as à foutre ?
J'ai pas dit que ça m'intéressait.
On recommence.
BRIGADE DES STUPÉFIANTS
POLICE DE BALTIMORE
Arrête de jouer...
Putain.
T'as les numéros pour les Preuves ?
- Non.
- Trouve-les.
- Pourquoi moi ?
- Tu veux la médaille, trouve les numéros.
- C'est une offre ?
- C'est ton tour.
C'est quoi, leur numéro de poste ?
Tu me prends pour ta bonne ?
- On prend la Mercedes ?
- Non, je l'ai promis à ma copine.
La bagnole est à son nom.
Brigade des Stups.
- Lieutenant, ligne 2.
- Voilà.
- Putain, j'arrive pas à taper.
- T'es pas la seule.
L'an 2000 est loin
et on en est encore aux Smith-Corona.
Il faut faire installer les ordis.
On nous a promis un stage il y a un an.
Qu'est-ce qu'un retardé comme toi
ferait d'un ordinateur ?
- Je sais pas, jouer en bourse.
- Te branler, tu veux dire.
Si on fait installer les ordis,
Herc va kiffer sur le porno
pendant que Kima
sera toujours en train de taper sur ce truc.
- Il faut monter.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Le préfet adjoint chie une pendule.
- Le major est au courant ?
- Il est là-haut.
Il a dû se faire chier dessus.
Comme s'il avait pas l'habitude.
C'est ça, la hiérarchie.
La pisse coule vers le bas.
- C'est de merde, qu'on parle.
- C'est la même chose, quand on y pense.
- La merde roule, la pisse s'écoule.
- Mais vers le bas.
Ça, t'en sais rien...
C'est pas pour changer de sujet,
mais pourquoi y a que deux numéros ?
- Drogue et flingues.
- Deux flingues, non ?
- Ça fait trois.
- Putain, Kima.
Si tu veux un boulot bien fait,
fais-le toi-même.
Il veut dire
qu'on est une bonne force de dissuasion
dans la guerre contre la drogue dans la rue.
- Quand on éclate la gueule aux connards.
- C'est ça.
Dis merde à la paperasse.
- Récolte les cadavres, casse les gueules.
- Casse bien.
- Façon Westside.
- C'est ça.
Vous me les coupez, bande de héros.
La guerre contre la drogue,
une brutalité après l'autre.
On ne peut même pas appeler ça une guerre.
Pourquoi ?
Les guerres ont une fin.
Tu vas écrire ça ?
Si tu savais comme je suis content
que ce soit toi qui me bipes.
Relax, Max,
Ie cadavre ne s'enfuira pas.
- C'est au tour de Nolan, pas au nôtre.
- Je sais.
Mais évidemment, t'as pris l'appel.
- J'ai des dettes à payer.
- C'est pas lui qui va t'aider.
Je te laisse une minute
et qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- C'est bon, j'ai compris.
- Dis les mots, Bunk.
- Arrête.
- Dis-les-moi.
Alors, tu vas me laisser tomber ?
C'est pas cool, Jimmy.
Très bien. C'est mon affaire, alors.
C'est mon dossier.
On a un meurtre sur les bras
et toi tu restes ici à te foutre de ma gueule.
T'es content, connard ?
Ça t'apprendra à te mêler
de ce qui te regarde pas.
Ça ne va même pas être un meurtre.
Cet enculé est probablement entré ici
pour chier et il se sera cassé la gueule.
Je parie que c'est rien d'autre.
- C'est ce que t'espères.
- Où tu vas ?
Je retourne au bureau, à ma place.
Espèce d'enculé.
T'as pas intérêt à ce que ce soit un meurtre.
T'as pas intérêt.
Demain, lieutenant. Et que ce soit fait.
- Le major est énervé.
- Y a de quoi.
Il n'avait pas de réponses
pour le préfet adjoint.
- À quel sujet ?
- Sur Avon Barksdale.
Qui ?
- C'est ce que j'ai dit.
- C'est qui, ce mec ?
D'après le juge Phelan,
un gangster du Westside qui s'amuse
à buter des gens de temps en temps.
Je n'avais jamais
entendu parler de M. Barksdale,
mais à partir de demain...
Bon, qu'est-ce qu'on sait ?
D'après le juge,
il contrôle les tours du Westside.
Surtout la cité Franklin.
- Ça me paraît louche.
- Peut-être.
- Ce soir obligatoirement ?
- Il veut le dossier demain matin.
Appelez Andrews aux Stups.
Demandez ce qu'ils ont sur ce type.
Appelez Andrews aux Stups.
Demandez ce qu'ils ont sur ce type.
Et la Crim ? Si c'est un tueur...
Le major de la Crim était à la réunion.
Son équipe va aussi monter un dossier.
Je pense pas qu'ils vous diront,
mais vous pouvez essayer.
Barksdale, Avon.
Une date de naissance ?
POLICE DE BALTIMORE
BRIGADE CRIMINELLE
- Jay.
- Où t'étais passé, aujourd'hui ?
J'ai bu, fumé du crack. Je me suis prostitué
dans les rues de Baltimore.
Au moins, t'as une excuse.
Mais ton connard de coéquipier
a pris un appel.
- Oui, je l'ai vu.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il a récolté ?
- Un cadavre en décomposition.
- Putain !
C'était au tour de l'équipe de Nolan.
Une décomposition.
Ça peut être une mort naturelle.
- Tu crois ?
- Dans la cité Poe, aucune chance.
Attends.
Le major veut te parler avant que tu partes.
- De quoi ?
- Qu'est-ce que j'en sais ? Je suis sergent.
Asseyez-vous, inspecteur.
Quelque chose ne va pas ?
Posez le cul sur cette chaise.
Vous voyez ça, McNulty ? Je vous les mets.
Et je vous les mettrai
tant que j'aurai pas pris ma revanche.
Major, que...
Me faites pas le coup du "major",
espèce de sale traître.
Qu'est-ce que vous foutiez au tribunal ?
Pourquoi vous avez parlé
à un connard de juge ?
Je vous les mets, McNulty.
Celui-ci va trouer
votre putain de cul d'lrlandais,
et celui-là, je vous le mets dans l'oeil.
Moi, je réponds à des questions
sur un mec des cités inconnu au bataillon
qui aurait tué impunément
10 mecs dans mon district.
Trois. Ils n'ont été acquittés que trois fois.
Le préfet adjoint m'a parlé de 10.
Non, ils en ont tué 10,
mais n'ont été inculpés que pour trois.
- Vous dites n'importe quoi.
- Vous pouvez vérifier les dossiers.
Maurice Scroggins, Toreen Boyd,
Roland Leggett.
La fille dans la cage d'escalier
de la rue Saratoga.
Collette machin.
Ce ne sont pas des rigolos, major.
Ils m'ont eu sur l'affaire Gérard Bogue
de la même manière que pour Barlow.
Scroggins ? Je n'ai pas de dossier sur lui.
L'été dernier.
Deux balles dans la nuque,
dans la cour des pavillons.
Que je comprenne bien.
Grâce à vous, je me fais bouffer les couilles
sur un truc qui remonte à l'an dernier ?
Vous croyez que j'ai besoin de ça,
petit fouille-merde ?
Major, je suis vraiment désolé.
Phelan et moi,
on se connaît depuis longtemps.
Il voulait mon opinion sur le gang
qui était au tribunal.
J'ai dû monter sans être préparé
et expliquer au préfet adjoint
pourquoi on lui parle de meurtres
dont personne n'a rien à foutre.
Écoutez, ce juge me met dans la merde.
Il me pose des questions et j'y réponds.
Je ne savais pas qu'il allait en parler.
Vous avez mon attention, inspecteur.
Toute mon attention.
- Oui, major.
- Où allez-vous ?
- Je travaille de 8 h à 16 h.
- Non.
- Vous tapez.
- Pardon ?
Le préfet adjoint
veut un rapport sur son bureau à 8 h.
- Un rapport ?
- Propre, sans fautes de frappe.
Que ça ait l'air juste, avec mon nom dessus.
Je parle de tous les meurtres,
ou je mets la pédale douce ?
Tout le monde est au courant, non ?
Ne me faites pas passer pour un con
une deuxième fois.
Quand vous ferez la liste, mettez
un petit point à côté de chaque affaire.
- Le préfet adjoint aime les points.
- Je suis vraiment désolé.
Les mecs pètent les plombs.
À l'est, à l'ouest, tout le monde se lâche.
- T'as pas de problèmes ?
- Pas du tout, ça roule.
Au tribunal aussi, ça l'a fait.
Je savais pas comment ça allait tourner.
Je me demandais
comment vous alliez m'en sortir.
C'était cool,
le coup de la meuf de la sécurité.
Impressionnant.
On va marcher.
- C'est quoi, la règle ?
- Je la connais.
Dis-la.
Ne pas parler dans une voiture.
Ni au téléphone, ni dans un lieu inconnu.
Ne pas parler à un inconnu. Mais c'était toi.
C'est ta putain de bagnole.
Ne parle pas dans la voiture.
Et Marcel ?
Non, j'invite pas Marcel.
- Tu veux qu'il dégage ?
- Tu fais ce que tu veux.
En fait, non.
Va lui faire payer ses consommations.
Ce naze.
- Ça va ?
- Salut, Dee, content de te voir.
Comment ça va ?
Tu te souviens du flic qui a essayé
de faire tomber Kevin pour Gérard ?
- Lequel ?
- Un inspecteur blanc aux cheveux noirs.
- Celui qui frappait à toutes les portes.
- Et alors ?
Il s'est pointé au tribunal pour regarder.
Sérieux ?
Pourquoi tu parles à cet enculé ?
Putain, Dee.
Il a parlé ?
Non, il est resté assis au fond.
- Comment ça va, mon pote ?
- Qu'est-ce que t'as ?
Viens, j'ai un truc pour toi.
- Tu dois être content.
- Tu sais ce que c'est.
- Alors ?
- Tu sais, la taule, c'est pas de la blague.
J'en sais rien.
Et j'ai pas l'intention d'en savoir plus.
Tu vois ?
Mais si tu veux parler de taule,
va t'asseoir à côté de Marcel.
- Il en sort.
- T'as raison.
Assieds-toi.
Je sais que ça s'est mal passé.
Mais Pooh m'a surpris.
- Il m'est tombé dessus comme un taré.
- Alors tu l'as buté ?
C'était lui ou moi.
Dans notre immeuble.
Des potes dans les deux escaliers.
D'autres dans la cour.
Et t'as un flingue.
Alors, ce que j'essaie de comprendre,
c'est comment t'as pu descendre ce type
devant la guérite de sécurité
avec tout ce monde-là ?
Ce mec m'est tombé dessus,
- il voulait me tuer.
- C'est pas lui, le problème.
C'est toi.
T'as pas pu le faire sortir.
T'as pas pu encaisser.
Le premier truc que t'as fait,
c'est de t'énerver,
de sortir ton flingue,
et de faire une connerie
que maintenant, on doit réparer.
Je sais.
T'as pas dit un seul truc
que je voulais entendre.
T'as raison. Il faut que je réfléchisse plus.
Tu dis tout le temps ça et t'as raison.
Mais quand même,
ce que vous avez fait,
avec la meuf de la sécu,
c'était mortel. Le procureur, putain.
J'ai jamais vu une Blanche
devenir aussi rouge.
T'aurais dû voir ça.
Tu fais partie de la famille, compris ?
Mais ce truc coûte de l'argent.
Du temps et de l'argent.
Tu vas assurer ?
C'est sûr. Tu vas voir.
Quand je retourne à la tour,
je vais pousser les mecs.
Bien.
Viens ici.
Ne sors pas d'ici comme ça.
- Tu fais partie de la famille.
- Oui.
- C'est une histoire d'amour.
- Oui.
Fais moins de bruit en tapant.
Fallait pas m'attendre, mon chou.
Ton type a eu une crise cardiaque ?
Non, j'ai essayé,
mais Frazier ne m'a pas cru
quand on a trouvé ça.
- T'as vraiment merdé.
- À ce propos, qu'est-ce que tu fais ici ?
J'ai foiré, Bunk. C'était pas ma faute.
Sérieusement.
Le juge Phelan a voulu me parler
quand le jury a libéré Barksdale.
Comme il est juge,
je lui ai lâché deux trois trucs.
Il a foutu la merde ?
L'adjoint a fait chier le major
et je dois faire un rapport pour ce matin.
Ça t'apprendra à te mêler
de ce qui te regarde pas.
Regarde-les, Cole.
Ça te fait pas bander
d'être dans la même pièce
que deux fonctionnaires
nobles et dévoués ?
Ouais, je suis fier.
Dis-moi que celui-là, tu l'as épinglé.
Bien sûr que non.
Il a fallu que ton coéquipier
se pointe au tribunal
et aille raconter nos salades devant un juge.
T'es au courant.
Le major m'a appelé chez moi
et m'a dit d'arriver tôt
pour lire par-dessus ton épaule.
Y a des points.
L'adjoint adore les points.
Va te faire voir, avec tes points.
Je n'ai fait que répondre à des questions.
C'est un juge, putain.
Et l'adjoint est un putain d'adjoint.
Lui, et non pas le juge,
tient ce qui reste de ta carrière de merde
dans ses petites mains.
Un mot de lui,
et demain,
tu te retrouves îlotier dans le quartier ouest.
- Je m'en fous, c'est de là que je viens.
- Et où tu ne veux pas aller, ducon ?
Au service des Preuves ? Au Personnel ?
- À la Sécurité du Q.G. ?
- Sur le bateau.
Dans la Marine ?
Ouais, les vapeurs de diesel
me donnent le mal de mer.
C'est bien, continue comme ça.
Je parie ça contre 10 $ que tu te retrouves
au quart de minuit sur le bateau.
Écoute-le, Jimmy.
Salut, Stringer.
- T'arrives tôt.
- Ouais, j'assure, aujourd'hui.
Eggy a donné les échantillons ?
Aujourd'hui, on change.
Tu pars en avance. Tu fais les pavillons.
- Quoi ?
- Tu prends les pavillons.
Les pavillons ? Y a déjà Ronnie Mo.
Ronnie Mo fait la 851 ce matin.
Pourquoi tu fais ça
alors que j'avais une tour depuis cet été ?
Ouais, t'avais une tour.
Et tu la retrouveras peut-être
si tu déconnes pas.
Ça craint.
Montre-nous que t'assures aux pavillons
et tu reviendras vite à la cité.
Mon oncle est au courant ?
À ton avis ?
- Eh, Bey.
- Ouais.
Dépose le petit cousin sur ton chemin.
- Que vos hommes parlent à Daniels.
- Bien.
Vous allez envoyer McNulty ?
Parlez-lui de la hiérarchie.
Parlez-lui vous-même, pour moi, il est mort.
- Si tu cherches Ronnie Mo, il est à la cité.
- Je sais.
T'es Dee, c'est ça ?
- T'étais pas dans les tours ?
- Ouais.
Pourquoi on t'a mis ici ?
T'as merdé avec la thune ?
J'ai buté un mec.
Dernière chance pour les capsules !
Major ?
Avec ce que les Stups nous ont donné,
qu'est-ce qu'on a sur ce type ?
Lieutenant, j'ai combien de pages
dans la main ?
- Quatre.
- Rawls avait un putain de bottin.
Ils ont 10 dossiers d'homicide en cours.
Si on était à leur place,
le dossier serait bouclé.
Je le leur ai dit.
Ils n'arrivent pas à l'inculper de meurtre,
- alors ils nous font faire le boulot.
- Ils nous ont eu.
En fait, ils vous ont eu.
Pardon ?
Dawson est sur l'affaire York et Cator.
Il reste vous.
Bon, organisez quelque chose avec la Crim,
et d'autres membres de votre équipe.
- Le bureau du procureur ?
- Ouais, appelons-les aussi.
Quel merdier.
Lieutenant, ligne 3.
C'est le préfet adjoint.
Et voilà.
Ferme ça pour moi.
Le café, c'est pour quoi ?
Ça ressemble plus à de l'argent,
c'est moins blanc.
Ouais.
Au moins, y en a sur les deux côtés,
cette fois.
Bon, passe-moi un vrai.
Pourquoi on utilise de vrais billets ?
Ils sont pas cons.
Tu piges ?
Je marche.
Tu marches ? Johnny marche.
- T'as le boulot.
- Je peux avoir un tête-à-tête ?
Poot !
Hé, Wallace !
C'est comme ça
que Ronnie Mo fonctionnait ?
- Ouais.
- Ça craint.
Regarde, on peut pas servir les clients
juste après avoir pris la thune.
Si quelqu'un prend des photos,
il a toute la scène.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
Tu te fais payer
et tu les envoies
de l'autre côté de l'immeuble.
Après, tu sers. Pigé ?
Il faut commencer à assurer.
Plus de raccourcis.
- T'en es où ?
- J'ai 270 $.
Tu devrais compter.
Je sais pas comment ça marche
dans les tours,
- mais ici, vaut mieux compter.
- Putain.
Vous vous êtes fait avoir.
C'est tout ce que t'as à dire ?
Tu crois que c'est de l'argent, ça ?
L'argent, c'est vert. Ça se sent au toucher.
- Pour toi, c'est vert, ça ?
- Y a un Président mort dessus.
Le Président, je l'emmerde !
- C'est pas de l'argent.
- Il est pas Président.
- Comment ça ?
- Hamilton.
- Il est pas Président.
- T'es cinglé ?
Un connard de Blanc
n'aurait jamais sa gueule
sur un billet s'il était pas Président.
Si ça se reproduit,
tu t'occupes plus de la thune. Compris ?
Et tu ne serviras plus.
Tu te retrouveras
à l'autre bout de la rue Vine
à picoler et à gueuler "22 !" Tu piges ?
Allez, dégage !
C'est tout ?
Non.
Il faut que t'y ailles doucement.
- Johnny, tu m'entends ?
- C'est bon.
Sérieux, tu vas faire une overdose
un de ces jours, si tu continues à ce rythme.
J'essaie de t'expliquer comment faire,
mais tu fais semblant de tout savoir.
Je sais plein de trucs, Bubbs.
Non, t'es un bleu.
J'essaie de te faire mûrir,
mais t'es qu'un bleu.
Tu veux me faire mûrir ?
Bubbs.
Laisse-moi faire l'arnaque, demain.
Allez, je suis prêt.
Je suis mûr.
Putain, t'es à peine sorti de l'oeuf.
PRÉFET ADJOINT AUX OPÉRATIONS
ERVIN H. BURRELL
- On achète, on arrête.
- Oui, M. Ie préfet.
Pas de surveillances interminables,
pas de micros, pas de bips.
Je veux que ce soit fait
aussi vite que possible.
C'est logique.
Phelan n'est pas qu'un juge.
C'est quelqu'un de très influent.
S'il demande quelque chose,
je veux le lui donner.
Pourquoi s'intéresse-t-il à ce Barksdale ?
Il a vu son procureur perdre un procès
cette semaine.
- Elle a perdu un procès en homicide.
- Ça arrive tout le temps.
Oui, mais là, un juge s'y est intéressé.
- Vous prenez qui ?
- Le meilleur inspecteur ?
- Greggs, c'est la meilleure.
- Je la connais ?
On l'a depuis quatre mois.
Elle était aux Stups dans l'est.
- La Crim envoie qui ?
- Le major Rawls décidera.
À mon avis, vous aurez McNulty.
- Vous le connaissez ?
- Pas vraiment.
C'est lui qui est allé cafter au juge.
- Il lui a parlé ?
- Oui, si j'ai bien compris.
S'il se retrouve sur l'affaire,
protégez vos arrières.
S'il vous faut quelque chose, dites-le-moi.
Je ferai tout pour vous aider.
- Mais pas de mauvaises surprises.
- Non, monsieur.
Tenez-moi au courant.
F.B.I. DÉPARTEMENT DE BALTIMORE
- Bonjour, McNulty, brigade criminelle.
- Vous êtes attendu ?
Oui, par l'agent Fitzhugh, 5e équipe.
Il m'attend, je peux...
- Pas sans escorte.
- Bien.
Agent Fitzhugh, à l'entrée.
- Fitz.
- Salut, mon pote.
- Elle reconnaît les méchants.
- C'est pas perso.
La sécurité, de nos jours, tu connais.
Je sais comment ils traitent les locaux.
Quoi de neuf ?
- Des bonnes choses.
- Ouais ?
Ton mec nous a filé un putain de dossier.
Tu sais bien choisir tes indics, Jimmy.
C'est l'un des meilleurs que j'aie vus.
- Tu as des enregistrements ?
- Plus que ça.
Et il se vante d'avoir un bon plan
avec un label, tu vois ?
- Sans déconner.
- Putain, le mec.
- T'es accro aux chattes.
- Putain.
- Génial, non ?
- Comment t'as enregistré ça ?
C'est pas enregistré. C'est du direct.
Du direct ?
En direct d'un troisième étage
de l'avenue Homer
à côté de Pimlico.
Ça se passe en ce moment ?
- En ce moment même.
- Comment ?
Une caméra à fibre optique.
Elle est derrière un trou de la cloison.
Si petit qu'il aurait pu être fait par un clou.
Où est le micro ? Le son est super bon.
Deux sans-fil derrière des plinthes.
Il y a environ 3 000 $
de coke pure sur la table.
On la suit depuis New York.
Tu bosses là-dessus à New York ?
On pourrait.
On a remonté une filière dominicaine.
On pourrait avoir
une autorisation de mise sur écoute.
On pourrait avoir
une autorisation de mise sur écoute.
Mais c'est pas la bonne guerre.
La plupart de l'équipe est passée
au contre-terrorisme.
Ça, c'est notre dernière affaire de drogue
et je dois la boucler d'ici la fin du mois.
- Vous laissez tomber la drogue ?
- Ouais, pour le moment.
On n'a pas assez de monde
pour une grosse affaire.
Pas depuis que les tours sont tombées.
Quoi, on n'a pas le coeur assez gros
pour deux guerres ?
- On se fout de notre gueule, hein ?
- Sans doute.
En tout cas, t'es un bon.
J'aurais voulu bosser avec toi.
Un Tech-9 par ici. Tech-9 à vendre.
Voilà 20 $. File-moi la came.
Deux et deux.
- Attends.
- Quoi ?
- Deux et deux, c'est tout.
- Putain, j'ai pas le temps.
- Je t'ai filé 20 $.
- 20 $ ?
Un et un petit trois.
- Donc je te rends deux...
- 7 $.
- Attends.
- Tu me rends 7 $. Allez.
Du calme.
Attends, tu me perturbes. Calme-toi.
Tu laisses tomber des trucs par terre ?
- Attends.
- J'ai pas toute la journée.
Attends, c'est facile. On reprend.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Regarde ce truc, putain !
C'est cet enculé, là-bas !
- Qui ?
- Le Blanc, là.
Poot, chope ce mec.
Le Blanc.
Attends !
Arrêtez cet enculé de Blanc.
Espèce d'enculé ! Prends ça, connard !
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Du calme.
Tu me fais courir, c'est quoi, ton problème ?
- Pourquoi tu te fous de ma gueule ?
- Merde.
C'est le connard des faux billets.
Je l'ai vu en laisser tomber un.
- C'était pas moi.
- Enculé.
C'est lui, je l'ai vu. Relève-toi.
Écoutez, je suis désolé.
Je t'emmerde.
Cet enculé nous a arnaqués de 30 $.
On va l'emmener avenue Franklin
et le jeter sur la voie rapide.
Écoutez, je suis vraiment désolé.
J'ai déconné.
- Qu'est-ce que t'as sur toi ?
- Les 10 $ que j'ai laissé tomber.
Bon, alors ?
Et puis merde.
C'est ça.
Pour l'instant, les Stups sont responsables.
Kima aura le dossier.
On en fera une copie pour Ronnie
au tribunal et pour vous.
Ça marche pour nous.
McNulty et Santangelo
bosseront sur les meurtres
et verront si on peut monter un truc.
Kima et mon équipe s'occuperont
des dealers de la cité Franklin.
On arrête vite fait bien fait.
Si on en boucle quelques-uns,
d'autres tomberont.
Vous n'aurez pas
Avon Barksdale ou Stringer Bell
ou n'importe qui de haut placé
avec des raids de rue.
- Vous n'en savez rien.
- Ces types sont forts.
Ils sont bien organisés.
Tout le monde a peur d'eux.
Que suggérez-vous ?
Surveillance, numéros appelés,
vérification fiscale.
On accumule les preuves jusqu'à la faille.
Un indic avec micro ou une mise sur écoute.
Voilà ce qu'il faut.
C'est ce que vous avez raconté au juge ?
D'accord, j'ai merdé.
Mais pour ça, j'ai raison.
Ni micros ni enregistrements.
On fait ça vite fait bien fait.
Alors ça ne va pas se faire.
Vous auriez pu vous disputer
avant d'appeler le bureau du procureur.
Laisse-moi te poser une question.
On sait quoi sur Avon Barksdale ?
Ce qu'on sait ?
Il contrôle la cité Franklin depuis un an.
On a quoi, sur lui ? Sa date de naissance ?
Un casier judiciaire ?
Une photo du F.B.I. ?
On n'a même pas une photo de lui.
Me fais pas rire, Jimmy.
Il y a deux jours, personne à cet étage
ne connaissait son nom.
Et maintenant, c'est un génie du crime.
Je dis : on descend à la cité Franklin
et on fout la merde.
C'est un arbitre, qu'il vous faut,
pas un procureur.
Quand vous saurez comment jouer,
appelez-nous.
Je sais comment on va jouer.
Mon équipe va aller sur le terrain.
McNulty et Santangelo vont potasser
les meurtres qui ont été commis
et essayer de monter une accusation.
Quand ça chauffera, je demanderai
d'autres hommes au préfet adjoint
mais on ne va pas s'éterniser.
Dans un mois,
on sera tous retournés à notre routine.
Bien, apportez-moi vos arrestations.
Les infos sur les meurtres,
c'est pour llene Nathan, aux Crimes violents.
Je lui expliquerai.
Rien d'autre ?
Une dernière chose.
Personne n'agit dans la rue
sans que j'en sois averti.
La hiérarchie, inspecteur.
C'est comme ça que ça se passe, ici.
Si elle te nique sur les visites,
envoie-la au tribunal.
C'est pas si simple que ça.
Le juge me donne trois week-ends
sur quatre, mais elle doit y mettre du sien.
Tu sais, être flexible,
pour que quand je bosse un week-end,
on puisse échanger.
Le juge me donne trois week-ends
sans flexibilité.
J'y perds.
- Vous ne pouvez pas en parler ?
- Non.
Pourquoi tout le monde
est toujours énervé contre toi ?
Tu connais Daniels ? Aux Stups ?
- Quoi ?
- Il supervise le détachement.
- Fais gaffe, alors.
- C'est un tordu ?
Non, mais il est loyal.
C'est un espoir.
La rumeur dit qu'il aura
le prochain commissariat.
Il va passer major ?
Il est noir, encore jeune,
et n'a fait chier personne.
- Il est même diplômé en droit.
- Sans déconner.
- De la fac de Baltimore, mais quand même.
- Il va faire foirer l'affaire Barksdale.
- Comment ça ?
- Vite fait bien fait ?
- Il pisse dans un violon.
- Tu l'as déjà fait foirer.
C'est toi qui l'as créée.
J'ai l'impression d'être le connard
au bout du Pont de la rivière Kwai.
- Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait, putain ?
- Le pont de quoi ?
T'as pas vu le film ?
Je suis dans la merde.
Jusqu'au cou.
Putain, tu vas encore
me faire payer une tournée.
Deux autres.
- Tout est dans l'attitude.
- C'était juste quelques dollars.
- C'est pas l'argent.
- Mais on l'a éclaté.
C'est le message, Dee.
Tu ne peux pas montrer de faiblesse.
- Quand même.
- Quoi ?
String.
T'as pas touché à ton verre.
Tu veux de la compagnie ?
- Je suis pas un gogo.
- Ça tombe bien, je suis pas une pute.
Je suis pas un habitué.
- Je bosse pour Stringer.
- Il te paie, non ?
Allez, offre-moi un verre.
- Combien ?
- 20 $.
Je bois lentement.
Une autre fois, peut-être.
- Tu m'offres un verre, mon chou.
- Toi, tu me l'offres ?
Carla. Un verre.
- T'es où ?
- À ton avis ?
- T'es en retard dans ton boulot ?
- Un peu.
- Il te reste combien à faire ?
- Me prends pas la tête.
- Dix pages et toutes les notes.
- C'est pour quand ?
Demain, au début du cours.
La nuit va être longue.
En effet.
Je te rapporterai du café.
Alors, je me retrouve
à me taper toute la route Liberty
à 2 h du mat', pendant mon service de nuit,
avec deux meurtres et une fusillade
sur les bras, pour aller où ?
Virer une souris du placard
de la chambre de ma femme.
T'imagines le truc ?
Qu'est-ce que t'as fait ?
À ton avis ?
J'ai vite fait sortir la souris
et je suis retourné au boulot.
Y avait rien d'autre à faire.
Nadine a pété un câble
sur ce minuscule mulot.
À mon arrivée, elle était sur une chaise,
comme dans un dessin animé.
- Comment t'as attrapé la souris ?
- Attrapée ? Je l'ai dégommée, oui.
T'as tiré sur la souris ?
Avec ton 9 mm ?
J'ai d'abord buté
une chaussure de ma femme.
Je l'ai eue au deuxième coup.
Quoi ?
T'as tué une souris
avec ton arme de service ?
Ouais.
Qu'est-ce que t'as fait du cadavre ?
Je l'ai nettoyé.
J'ai pensé le laisser là
comme avertissement pour les autres.
Putain.
Putain, il est 3 h 30 du mat'
et je commence tôt.
Jimmy, il faut au moins
que j'aille me changer.
Je vais m'occuper de cette affaire.
Quoi ?
Je vais m'en occuper correctement.
Ça va être expédié, Jimmy.
- Je m'en fous.
- Jimmy.
On va se coucher.
Salut, Bubs.
Je te croyais encore en taule.
Non.
T'es sorti depuis longtemps ?
Ça fait trois mois.
T'écris pas, t'appelles pas.
C'est qui ?
Un ami.
Il va s'en sortir ?
T'es toujours aux Stups ?
Dans le centre, oui.
J'ai quelque chose pour toi.
- Dernière tournée !
- Putain.
On a trouvé un corps. Au 200 du bloc Amity.
Je suis pas trop là, aujourd'hui.
T'es pas le seul, tu te souviens ?
Il nous manque un homme depuis
que ton coéquipier a été détaché.
C'est bon.
Je m'en occupe.
Putain.
- Ça va, Bobby ?
- Bunk, quoi de neuf ?
Une ou deux balles dans le crâne.
Pas de témoins, pas de suspects.
Il y a une douille de .380 sur le sol.
Mets-la dans un sachet, s'il te plaît.
Qui a appelé ?
Personne. Un agent du poste 21 l'a trouvé.
Il s'appelle William Gant, 42, non, 43 ans,
il habitait rue Schroeder.
- Vous avez des photos ?
- Oui.
Bon, on l'emballe.
M. Gant, voyez-vous l'homme
que vous avez identifié
dans cette salle d'audience ?
Il est là.
C'est bien le témoin de l'affaire Barksdale.
Gant, William. 41 ans.
Mort d'une balle dans la tête
tirée à bout portant. Aplatie dans le crâne.
- Faut pas se fier aux apparences.
- Non ?
Un mec qui se promène
dans le quartier ouest
a plein de raisons de se faire buter.
- Ça, c'est vrai.
- Il a un casier ?
Des inconduites notoires, c'est tout.
Il bosse à l'entretien de la cité Poe.
Il vit seul, pas de femme, pas d'enfants.
Au palais de justice,
il n'apparaît que comme
témoin à charge dans l'affaire Barlow.
Alors c'est quand même
tiré par les cheveux.
Soyons réalistes.
C'est complètement con de le tuer
après qu'il ait témoigné.
C'est un sacré message.
C'est juste un mec têtu de la cité Franklin
qui a refusé de se faire acheter.
Si ce message s'adresse
aux occupants des tours, il est très clair.
Que vas-tu dire au major ?
Que je suis tombé sur un os.
- Ne minimise pas l'assassinat du témoin.
- Arrête.
Pourquoi foutre les chefs en rogne
avant d'en être sûr ?
Si je commence à débiter
sur la mort d'un témoin...
- Bunk, dis-lui.
- Pourquoi ?
Protège-toi dans cette affaire.
Jimmy, tu vas pas faire ce que je pense ?
Écoute.
Ça va te retomber sur la gueule.
Protège-toi.
- C'est quoi, cette histoire ?
- Rien.

"Tu ne peux pas perdre si tu ne joues pas."
-- Marla Daniels
Bonjour.
C'est pas vrai.
La vache.
Il faut baiser qui dans cette ville
pour avoir un bureau décent ?
Ça au moins, ça marche.
C'était pour McNulty.
- Je devrais pas être ici.
- Casse-toi, alors.
Ils ont tué un putain de témoin
de ton procès.
Oui, tu me l'as dit. Tu as fait ta B.A.
Selon les pouvoirs qui me sont conférés
par le Tribunal correctionnel,
je t'absous de tous tes péchés,
inspecteur McNulty.
C'est toi, mon péché.
Le major est furax que je t'aie parlé.
Jimmy, tu savais que j'allais l'appeler.
Admets-le.
Je ne pensais pas
que tu me foutrais dans une merde pareille.
Écoute, je ne suis plus procureur.
- Je suis juge, la donne est différente.
- T'as raté un endroit.
Ce qui est fait est fait.
Qu'est-ce que tu attends de moi ?
Que tu passes un coup de fil
au préfet adjoint.
- Il a déjà fait ses affectations.
- Parlons-en.
Ce con de lieutenant veut baiser
Barksdale en lui achetant de la came.
Tu veux foutre la pression ?
On n'a qu'à parler à la presse
du témoin assassiné.
Histoire de foutre la merde.
Ça mettrait la puce à l'oreille de Barksdale.
- Il faut pas que ce soit rendu public.
- Non ?
Dis juste au préfet adjoint
que t'as perdu un témoin de ton procès.
Ça obligera la police
à ouvrir une véritable enquête.
Et quand tu appelleras Burrell,
évite de parler de moi.
- T'as raté un endroit.
- Pourquoi tu le fais pas ?
J'ai plus d'ancienneté.
- Vous nous avez trouvés.
- Difficilement.
- C'est vous qui les avez détachés ?
- J'ai demandé des effectifs.
Asseyez-vous.
Putain, c'est quoi...
Monsieur, j'ai...
Il me montrait la détente de son Glock.
- Et il...
- Inspecteur ?
L'agent Pryzbylewski a tiré dans le mur,
lieutenant.
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi avez-vous tiré dans le mur,
agent Pryzbylewski ?
Je montrais à Carv la facilité de la détente.
- Je l'ai spécialement ajustée.
- Il a enlevé le chargeur.
Mais pas celui de la chambre.
Non, j'ai oublié celui de la chambre, et...
Je suis désolé, lieutenant.
- Doit-il faire un rapport ?
- Sur quoi ?
On tire une balle, on fait un rapport.
L'usage d'une arme mortelle se justifie.
Contre un mur de plâtre.
C'est un accident.
On va pas en faire un drame.
- Votre nom, c'est ?
- Pryzbylewski.
De l'unité des Véhicules ?
C'est Cantrell qui vous a envoyé.
Pas tout à fait.
Le lieutenant Cantrell m'a envoyé
à la section des Victimes il y a deux mois.
Et j'ai demandé à être muté.
Vous venez de la section des Victimes ?
C'est bon, cette merde.
- Encore meilleur avec la sauce piquante.
- Absolument.
- Dee, tu veux des nuggets ?
- Non, c'est bon.
Celui qui a inventé ça, il assure trop.
Carrément !
Putain, il a enlevé tous les os du poulet.
Avant ça, on devait rogner les os
et se dégueulasser les doigts.
Il a dit : "Bye" les os.
C'est une mine d'or,
cette idée de poulet sans os.
- Tu crois qu'il a été payé ?
- Qui ?
- Celui qui a inventé ça.
- Il est super riche.
Pourquoi ?
Tu crois qu'il touche un pourcentage ?
Pourquoi pas ?
Arrête, celui qui a inventé ça,
c'est un pauvre naze de chez McDo
qui a donné l'idée aux grands patrons.
- C'est pas juste.
- Exactement.
C'est pas une question de justice,
mais de fric.
Tu crois que Ronald
va aller voir le pauvre naze
pour lui dire : "M. Nugget, t'assures.
"On vend le poulet plus vite
que tu le désosses.
"Alors je vais te faire un gros chèque."
Merde.
Le mec qui a inventé ça
travaille toujours au salaire minimum,
en réfléchissant à la façon
d'améliorer ses frites.
Croyez-moi.
C'est quand même lui qui a eu l'idée.
Qui ?
Polk et Pat Mahone.
Des ivrognes du service des Propriétés.
- Je ne les connais pas.
- Normal.
Ils n'ont résolu aucune affaire en 10 ans.
On nous a aussi fourgué un jeune,
Prezbelowski ou Prezbelewski...
- Pryzbylewski, lui, je le connais.
- Ah bon ?
- Pourquoi était-il aux Victimes ?
- Il a tiré sur sa propre bagnole.
- Tu te rappelles ?
- Il a fait quoi ?
Il a vidé deux chargeurs
sur une voiture banalisée.
Il a lancé un appel à la radio,
faisant croire qu'il était attaqué.
Tu n'en as pas entendu parler ?
Il n'en a pas démordu jusqu'à ce
qu'on prouve que les balles provenaient
de son arme perso.
- On a failli l'inculper.
- Pourquoi "failli" ?
Il a des relations à la Mairie.
Je ne suis pas sûre.
Je ne peux rien faire
avec cette bande d'incapables.
Parles-en à l'adjoint. Il t'écoutera.
Pourquoi pas ?
Je lui ai demandé des effectifs.
Il a demandé deux hommes aux Propriétés
et deux aux Forces spéciales.
Aux affectations,
ils en profitent
pour nous fourguer les nazes.
L'adjoint le sait très bien.
Il aurait pu me laisser choisir,
mais il ne l'a pas fait.
- C'était un message.
- Mais encore ?
Ne creuse pas trop.
Inculpe Barksdale de n'importe quoi,
et classe l'affaire.
S'il m'envoie de bons policiers,
je ferai du bon travail.
- Mais si le bureau du procureur...
- Non.
Rhonda, ma chérie,
ce serait mal vu que je demande de l'aide
et que je m'en débarrasse.
- Toi, par contre...
- Pas question.
Ça ne marche pas comme ça.
Vous faites vos enquêtes,
vous nous apportez des preuves.
Si je m'en mêle,
ça va jeter le feu aux poudres.
Au mieux, je peux dire à mon chef
que tu as été brimé.
S'il veut le dire aux autorités
et appeler l'adjoint, c'est son choix.
- Il ne le fera pas.
- En effet.
Fais avec ce que t'as.
Merde !
Kima, où tu nous emmènes ?
- Baisse-toi.
- Quoi ?
Putain. Bonjour la discrétion.
De vrais éléphants.
Je viens de me planter un clou rouillé
dans le pied.
C'est un coup à choper le tétanos.
- Kima.
- Passe-moi le sac.
Kima, si je puis me permettre,
quand as-tu découvert
que tu préférais les femmes ?
Tu ne peux pas te permettre.
Salut, les mecs, ça va ?
- On n'a plus d'échantillons.
- Non.
J'ai pas besoin de tes services, mon frère.
Je vous offre les miens.
T'as quoi dans ton sac ?
S'il y a un truc qu'un Black préfère
à une nouvelle paire de pompes,
c'est un nouveau chapeau, non ?
Qu'est-ce qu'ils foutent ?
- Les keufs !
- Les keufs !
Planquez tout !
T'as rien ?
Vous allez pas me la faire, celle-là.
J'ai un témoin.
Vous avez ramassé ça par terre,
alors me faites pas porter le chapeau.
C'est comme ça que tu me vois ?
Il pense que je veux le dénoncer.
Dites pas le contraire.
Vous, les Stups du quartier ouest,
vous ramassez des merdes
et vous nous les collez sur le dos.
Je te connais, toi ?
Que les choses soient claires.
Je ne suis pas du quartier ouest.
Je ne suis pas des Stups.
Je ne dénonce personne,
parce que je me fous de la drogue.
Je suis de la Crim.
Je suis ici pour les cadavres.
D'Angelo le sait.
Tu m'as vu au procès, non ?
J'étais assis derrière Stringer,
je regardais, j'écoutais.
Vous êtes venus me faire chier avec ça ?
Je croyais que vous aviez entendu le jury.
- On s'en fout, du jury.
- Oui, on s'en fout.
On est entre nous.
Toi, moi, mon coéquipier et...
T'as dit que tu t'appelais comment, déjà ?
J'ai dit que dalle.
Juste toi, moi,
mon coéquipier et M. Que Dalle.
On parle juste de la vie.
On échange nos pensées.
- Tiens, Bunk, pour tes pensées.
- Pour les petits Blacks de la cité Franklin,
c'est rien de buter quelqu'un dans le hall
de la tour 221, non ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on en a à foutre ?
- Mais quand c'est un témoin...
- Un bosseur.
... qui n'est même pas dans la came...
Vous faites les innocents ?
Moi, je sais rien sur rien, mais je sais ça :
celui qui s'amuse à jouer les témoins,
il se fait buter.
Je sais que ça a l'air un peu cru,
mais c'est comme ça que ça marche par ici,
monsieur l'agent.
On se tire.
Et toi, D'Angelo ?
T'es d'accord avec ton pote ?
J'essaie de vous vendre des trucs
qui font kiffer les meufs.
Avant, il les faisait kiffer, Bubbles.
Moi, je dis que les meufs
sont plus ce qu'elles étaient
si on peut se les faire sans chapeau.
Tiens, mon grand.
- Il se passe quelque chose.
- Quoi ?
Je sais pas.
Carv. Approche.
Quand Bubbs
met le chapeau sur quelqu'un,
tu prends des photos.
- Ah oui ?
- Surtout le rouge.
Si tu le vois mettre le chapeau rouge
sur la tête de quelqu'un,
tu mitrailles.
Où tu vas ?
Carv. T'as remarqué
que la plupart du temps,
Kima s'imagine
qu'elle est au-dessus de nous ?
Je vois pas de galons
sur sa putain de manche,
c'est pas ce que je vois.
Ce que je vois, c'est une gouine arrogante
qui vient de débarquer à la Crim,
et qui nous dit quoi faire, bordel.
C'est pas normal. Tu trouves ça normal ?
Ferme-la un peu. J'essaie de me concentrer.
Beau véhicule.
Non ? Ça fait l'haleine super fraîche.
Vous allez m'arrêter ? Alors, allez-y, putain.
Sinon, vos gueules.
- Tu veux qu'on t'arrête ?
- Non.
- Ta gueule toi-même.
- Je me tire.
D'Angelo. Je te conseille de collaborer.
Merde.
- Vous avez rien d'autre à foutre ?
- Non.
Vous avez rien contre moi.
Vos mains sont pas au bon endroit.
Vous êtes nouveau, ou quoi ?
Allez, Dee.
On avance.
C'est Greggs. Passez-moi le lieutenant.
Prez ? C'est un bon à rien, un vrai naze.
Pourquoi on me l'a fourgué ?
Pourquoi est-il encore dans la police ?
Tu connais Valchek
dans le quartier sud-est ?
- Oui.
- C'est son beau-fils.
Je ne peux pas le garder.
Tu sais qui on m'a envoyé d'autre ?
- Qui ?
- Polk et Mahone.
Ces deux ivrognes
peuvent même pas conduire.
Et celui des Prêts sur gage ?
Lester Freamon ? Une crème.
Il ne trouverait même pas son flingue.
Reprends Pryzbylewski.
J'aimerais bien, mais je ne peux pas.
J'ai donné ma parole à Valchek.
J'y peux rien si Prez baise sa fille.
- Sans ça, il ne serait plus flic.
- Tu dois quelque chose à Valchek ?
Si je le contrarie,
je suis grillé pour ma promotion.
Moi aussi,
j'ai des chances de devenir major.
Valchek a de l'influence
sur le Club démocratique,
qui a de l'influence sur le maire,
et moi j'ai que dalle.
Je te revaudrai ça.
- Donne-moi Sydnor.
- Pas question.
Donne-le-moi et je garde Prez.
C'est mon meilleur élément, impossible.
- J'ai aussi le pire.
- Steinman ?
On enquête sur la drogue dans l'ouest.
Il me faut un Black.
Il me faut Sydnor.
- Tu sais ce qu'a fait Prez ce matin ?
- Dis-moi.
Il a testé son flingue
dans le bureau du détachement.
Je peux rien promettre.
Mais si tu me donnes Sydnor,
j'essaie de garder Prez.
D'accord, Cedric, merde. T'es têtu.
Qu'avez-vous dit au juge ?
Que nous examinions la situation.
Je lui ai demandé
de ne pas en parler publiquement.
Alors il ne va pas en parler à la presse ?
Le juge Phelan a appelé ce matin
pour dire qu'un témoin de son procès
avait été tué.
Le juge a-t-il dit comment il l'a su ?
C'est McNulty qui lui a dit.
C'est sa source.
Sauf votre respect, ça me dérangerait pas
de virer ce connard.
- On ne peut pas lui faire confiance.
- C'est embêtant, oui.
Si la presse en entend parler,
ça va être la cata.
Il faut donc rassurer le juge
pour l'empêcher de parler.
Une ou deux arrestations, ce serait bien.
Et si c'est vrai ?
Si Barksdale a fait assassiner
le témoin à charge ?
Vous êtes sérieux ?
Pourquoi l'assassiner
après qu'il ait témoigné ?
- Ça ne change rien.
- Par vengeance, pure et simple.
De la connerie pure et simple.
Je sais qu'il y a peut-être
des dizaines de raisons
pour que ce type se soit fait buter, mais si...
Pas de fric pour l'enquête préliminaire.
Ni pour la protection des témoins.
Cette ville n'a pas un rond, messieurs.
La dernière chose qu'on veut faire,
c'est annoncer le meurtre d'un témoin.
C'est déjà assez dur
de faire comparaître des criminels
dans ce tribunal.
- Il faut retirer McNulty de l'affaire.
- Qui s'occupe du meurtre ?
- Bunk, le coéquipier de McNulty.
- Il faut le retirer aussi, alors.
Non, si on retire McNulty,
le juge va alerter la presse.
Je le vois venir.
On attend,
on laisse McNulty faire de son mieux
en espérant qu'il échoue.
Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire ?
On n'a aucune preuve.
Si on bluffe, il va s'en rendre compte.
Oui, mais il a peur. Il est vulnérable.
On y va tous les deux ?
Attends.
- Il fait partie de mon affaire ?
- Non.
C'est un suspect potentiel
pour mon meurtre.
Qui fait peut-être partie de mon affaire.
Je prendrais bien un café. Tu en veux un ?
- Il faut que je vous parle.
- Nous allions juste...
Maintenant.
Je vous ai fait un sermon comme quoi
vous deviez me tenir au courant
et ne rien entreprendre sans m'en informer.
- Mais...
- J'étais sérieux.
Bunk a découvert un meurtre.
Ça n'a peut-être rien à voir avec Barksdale.
Je reviens du bureau du préfet adjoint.
Votre major lui a demandé de vous virer.
Vous m'entendez ? Rawls vous lâche.
- Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?
- Vous ne savez pas tenir votre langue.
Vous croyez que ce juge du centre-ville
va vous couvrir ?
Vous le croyez vraiment ?
Vous auriez dû me le dire.
En parlant d'abord à l'adjoint,
on aurait eu une chance.
Mais non, vous n'en faites qu'à votre tête.
- Il aurait écouté ?
- Dans cette affaire, oui.
Alors pourquoi on vous envoie
les pires flics en civil ?
Vous demandez des hommes,
on vous envoie des ivrognes et des nazes.
Je veux élucider cette affaire.
Moi aussi.
Alors il va falloir vous investir, lieutenant.
Si je vous vois vous investir,
je saurai à quoi m'en tenir.
- Qui est-ce ?
- D'Angelo Barksdale.
Oui.
Des preuves qui l'impliquent
dans la mort du témoin ?
- Que dalle.
- Pourquoi l'avez-vous arrêté ?
Pour l'interroger. Tester sa résistance.
- Elle y va avec vous.
- On n'a pas besoin d'elle.
Bunk et moi, on a nos habitudes.
Vous voulez que je m'investisse ?
C'est ce que j'avais cru comprendre.
Vous participez à l'interrogatoire,
mais c'est la Crim, alors il mène la danse.
Vérifie l'immatriculation
de ces deux véhicules.
- Ils nous ont vus arrêter le môme.
- C'est fait.
C'est déjà dans le dossier.
Vous étiez pas les seuls flics à la cité,
ce matin.
- Ah bon, où étais-tu ?
- Où était-elle ?
Le truc, c'est que je ne comprends pas
pourquoi cet homme a été tué.
Vraiment pas. Tu as été acquitté.
- On t'en veut pas.
- Pas du tout.
On est payés, de toute façon.
Et c'est pas si grave
d'avoir tiré deux ou trois pruneaux
sur Pooh Blanchard.
Il manquera à personne, celui-là.
Mais tu sais qui s'est fait tuer, cette fois ?
Tu sais qui c'était ?
Un citoyen.
Qui a travaillé toute sa vie. Tu le savais ?
Il se levait tous les matins
pour faire de l'entretien.
Le week-end, il faisait le taxi pour l'aéroport.
Deux boulots.
Et il était bénévole dans sa paroisse,
à heures perdues.
- Un homme qui allait à l'église.
- Un diacre.
Deux boulots et trois mômes. Tu le savais ?
Trois mômes. Jeunes, en plus.
Cinq, huit et onze ans.
Qui sont orphelins,
car leur maman est morte
il y a quelques années.
Et maintenant ils sont tout seuls.
- Il ne nous croit pas.
- Je sais qu'il nous croit pas.
Ça fait deux heures qu'on te parle,
et tu fais l'innocent.
Où est mon avocat ?
On l'a appelé. On te dira quand il arrive.
J'ai rien à dire.
Je suis désolé pour ce type,
mais j'ai rien à dire.
T'es désolé ? Désolé pour ce type ?
C'est toi qui l'as tué.
- Non.
- Si.
C'est pas toi qui l'as tué,
mais si t'avais pas été en train de buter
des gens dans le hall,
il aurait pas vu ça en sortant de l'ascenseur.
Et il aurait pas témoigné.
S'il avait pas témoigné,
ces mômes auraient encore un père.
- Pourquoi il a témoigné ?
- On sait pas.
- Il était pas obligé.
- Non, mais il l'a fait.
Et t'as quand même été acquitté.
Mais c'était pas suffisant. Pour le meurtre.
C'était un message
aux habitants de la cité Franklin.
Rien à foutre des mecs qui bossent.
Ou de leurs mômes.
C'est ça que je comprends pas,
avec la drogue.
Vous pouvez pas vendre votre merde
et vous tirer ?
Dans ce pays,
toutes les autres marchandises se vendent
sans que les gens se tirent dessus.
À la cité Franklin,
les cadavres s'accumulent.
Tu te rappelles ce petit garçon
qui s'est fait tirer dessus
chez le coiffeur rue Lombard, l'été dernier ?
Un mec en poursuit un autre
chez un coiffeur,
il vide son flingue.
Une embrouille
à cause de 20 capsules manquantes,
et ce pauvre gosse,
au lieu d'avoir sa première coupe,
il se prend un pruneau dans l'oeil.
Tu te rappelles ?
- C'est dégueulasse.
- Oui.
- C'est dégueulasse.
- Oui.
Ils n'avaient pas à faire ça.
Tirer dans un salon de coiffure ?
Non, ils n'avaient pas à faire ça.
Ce type, c'était...
mon problème.
Mon problème. Ils auraient pas dû...
Ils auraient pas dû faire ça.
Plus de parents.
Seigneur !
Je vais te dire ce que tu devrais faire,
D'Angelo...
pas parce que je crois que tu voulais
la mort de cet homme,
ou que tu es impliqué dans sa mort.
Mais je crois que tu pourrais te recueillir,
quelques minutes, y réfléchir un peu,
rassembler tes idées, quoi.
Et ensuite, ce serait bien
que tu écrives une petite lettre à ces enfants
et que tu leur dises que tu es désolé
qu'ils soient orphelins.
Dis juste quelque chose.
Dis-leur que tu penses personnellement
que ton oncle
a peut-être fait une erreur, cette fois,
parce que c'est moche
qu'ils aient perdu leur papa
à cause de ce qui s'est passé.
Ça leur fera peut-être du bien
de savoir que tu penses à eux.
J'ai rien à dire.
Écoute ton coeur.
Diacre ? T'y es allé fort.
En tout cas, ça a marché.
C'est déjà assez triste
avec les enfants orphelins, et tout.
C'est la photo des enfants de Bunk.
- C'est les tiens ?
- J'en ai peur, oui.
Heureusement
qu'ils ressemblent à leur mère.
Maurice Levy vient de verser la caution.
Il est près des ascenseurs.
- Pas de répit pour la défense.
- Honte à vous.
M'extirper de la maison Levy
un vendredi soir.
- Toutes mes excuses.
- Yvette a fait un ragoût.
- C'est bon ?
- Quand c'est chaud, oui. La 1 ou la 2 ?
Votre client.
C'est quoi, ce bordel ! Arrête d'écrire !
- Je fais juste...
- La ferme !
Quand il appelle son avocat,
c'est la fin de l'interrogatoire.
Votre client n'a pas fait de déclaration.
Il a juste décidé de son plein gré
d'écrire une lettre aux enfants du défunt.
- Pour dire que...
- Tais-toi !
- Il est inculpé ?
- Non.
Très bien. Lève-toi et marche ! Allez !
Tu ne dis rien,
tu ne fais rien, tu n'écris rien.
T'as compris ?
Tu la fermes !
Combien de fois
faut-il que je te le répète, merde ?
C'est quoi, ça ?
Une armoire. Louis XIV.
C'est un jouet ?
Je connais certains d'entre vous.
Les autres, ça ne saurait tarder.
Ceux qui ont déjà travaillé avec moi
savent que j'aime pas les cow-boys
ni les surprises.
La cible...
c'est Avon Barksdale,
et Avon Barksdale seulement.
Il ne faut pas s'éparpiller.
Les inspecteurs principaux sont Greggs,
de mon unité, et...
Greggs, de mon unité
et McNulty, de la Crim.
Ce sont eux qui ont les rênes.
Dans la rue, on travaille par deux.
Greggs et Sydnor. Herc et Carver.
McNulty et Santangelo, Mahone et Polk.
Pryzbylewski et Freamon.
Pour commencer, on a neuf...
Et là ? Ça a marché ?
Quoi ? Tu m'entends ?
Quoi ?
On a neuf ou dix affaires de meurtre
non résolues
à creuser pour trouver des pistes.
McNulty et Santangelo sont déjà là-dessus.
Herc, Carver, Sydnor, et moi,
on repère les dealers de rue
et on remonte la filière
aux hommes de Barksdale.
Polk et Mahone enquêteront
sur des pistes précises.
Freamon et Pryzbylewski s'occuperont
du travail administratif.
- Il faut un procureur...
- Non, éteins cette merde !
Quoi ?
Il faut un procureur.
C'est Rhonda Pearlman des Stups
qui a été désignée.
On n'a pas encore suffisamment de bureaux,
alors on partagera...
- Vous êtes tous des Achats ?
- Non.
Comme je le disais,
on nous a promis des ordinateurs
et de l'équipement de surveillance.
- Des questions ?
- Comment ça marche pour les heures sup ?
Pas d'heures sup,
sauf autorisation préalable.
Pour résoudre des affaires,
il faut de l'argent, lieutenant.
Si ce que vous me proposez
justifie des heures sup,
vous en ferez.
Mais en attendant,
vivez sur votre putain de salaire.
"Je suis désolé pour votre père.
Si j'avais pu intervenir, je l'aurais fait."
Que peut-on faire de ça ?
Légalement, rien.
Cette lettre ne l'implique pas,
ni personne, d'ailleurs.
Cela dit, la seule lecture possible,
c'est que cet homme a été tué
parce qu'il a été témoin.
Pourquoi s'excuserait-il
s'il n'a rien à voir là-dedans ?
On a perdu un témoin à charge.
Même à Baltimore,
c'est censé vouloir dire quelque chose.
Allez voir l'adjoint, montrez-lui ce qu'on a,
et on constitue un dossier solide.
Il faut des informateurs.
Il faut faire de la surveillance à long terme.
Il faudra aussi des tables d'écoute.
Et surtout,
des policiers qui savent s'en servir.
Vous pensez que ça va aider
de dire à tout le monde
qu'on tire sur nos témoins ?
Vous pensez que ça ne se sait pas déjà ?
C'est plus facile d'adopter un profil bas.
Comme je l'ai dit :
il faut faire le plus vite possible.
Sucre Domino
Tante June.
J'espère que tu as faim.
Je meurs de faim.
Dee !
Ça va ?
- C'est ton oncle ?
- Oui.
Je l'imaginais différent.
Alors, Dee, comment ça va ?
C'est ton fils ?
Le petit ressemble drôlement à son père.
Alors, petit bout ?
Tu ne pourras rien lui refuser, à celui-là.
Tu veux venir avec moi ?
Je sais que tu veux venir avec moi.
- Il faisait la sieste.
- Ah oui ?
Il vient de se réveiller.
T'as de la poigne ? Montre-moi.
Fais voir, tourne-toi.
Qu'est-ce que tu regardes ?
- Prépare-lui une assiette.
- D'accord.
Et remplis-la bien. Elle est toute maigre.
Viens, on va te donner à manger.
T'en fais pas, elle mange.
- Ça va bien, vous deux ?
- Oui, pas mal.
Elle veut que j'emménage chez elle,
j'y pense.
Viens, on va marcher.
Viens, on va marcher.
Et voilà. Tu prends le petit bonhomme ?
Oui.
Prends soin de mon petit soldat.
- Tu sais comment il s'appelle ?
- Non.
Mais il bosse dans la cage d'escalier.
- Et lui ?
- C'est Little Man.
C'est M. Muscle.
Tu connais son vrai nom ?
- Indic ?
- Oui.
- Je vous laisse ?
- Non, ça va.
Il est cool.
C'est quoi, ces chapeaux ?
Vas-y, dis-lui, Bubbles.
Je leur fais essayer
des chapeaux que je vends.
S'il y en a un qui vous intéresse,
je lui fais essayer le rouge,
et Kima prend des photos.
Ceux de la drogue, une autre couleur.
S'ils sont rien, ils ont rien.
C'est tout le gang de Barksdale ?
À la cité Franklin.
On est pas encore allés dans les pavillons.
C'est pas con.
Ça me plaît.
Bubbles n'oublie jamais un visage.
J'ai pas la mémoire des noms,
mais je me rappelle les visages.
Avant, je lui faisais regarder
les photos des évadés.
Le soir même,
il appelait pour me dire où ils étaient.
Oui, 25 $ l'info.
- C'est bien payé.
- Ouais.
C'est combien pour les chapeaux ?
Zéro.
C'est gratis.
- Ces fils de pute ont tabassé mon pote.
- Qui ?
Le gang des pavillons.
C'est qui, ton pote ?
Un ami.
Un jeune Blanc.
Il traînait dans le quartier,
il y connaissait rien.
J'étais son mentor.
Que s'est-il passé ?
- Ils lui ont cassé la gueule.
- T'étais là ?
Une raclée pareille
pour quelques dollars, vraiment !
Il est encore à l'hôpital,
avec des tubes dans le nez.
Il peut à peine parler.
Mais c'est comme ça.
Comment tu te sens, Bubbles ?
Un peu à cran.
C'est ce qui me semblait.
Allez.
Tu peux me filer 10 $ jusqu'à demain ?
Pour tenir jusqu'à demain, Kima.
Bubbles.
Merci.
Ne va pas dans la cité
au cours des prochains jours,
pour être sûr.
Elle s'inquiète toujours pour moi.
- Change de trajet, Bubs.
- Oui, oui.
Va dans le quartier est.
Oui, oui.
20 $ ?
- Il va prendre de mauvaises habitudes.
- J'admire son travail.
Ils ont cité ton nom, Stringer, Wee-Bey,
Savino, Peanut...
Ils connaissaient beaucoup de noms.
Mais t'as rien dit ?
Je sais rien.
T'écrivais quoi, alors ?
Ils ont parlé du mec qui s'est fait tuer,
de ses mômes, ils m'ont dit d'écrire.
- En quoi ça te regarde, Dee ?
- C'est ce que j'ai dit.
Ils ont sorti les violons
à propos des mômes.
Je me suis dit que ça me coûtait rien
de dire que j'étais désolé.
Pourquoi tu devrais dire que t'es désolé ?
Cet enculé a failli t'envoyer en taule.
Oui, mais j'ai été acquitté.
Ce que je veux dire,
c'est que je regrette que vous...
Je regrette ce qui est arrivé à ce mec.
Tout ce qu'il a fait,
c'est sortir de l'ascenseur
pendant que je faisais ce que tu sais.
Qu'est-ce que t'en penses, cousin ?
De quoi ?
De ce qui est arrivé à ce type.
Tu crois que c'est nous qui l'avons tué ?
Dis ce que tu penses.
- Je sais pas.
- Exactement.
Tu sais pas, et t'as pas à savoir.
Si on l'a fait, il y avait une raison.
Si on l'a pas fait aussi.
Qu'on l'ait fait ou pas, ça te regarde pas.
T'as rien à voir là-dedans.
Pigé ?
La prochaine fois que tu te fais arrêter,
t'as pas intérêt à écrire quoi que ce soit.
- Compris ?
- Oui.
Allez, on va s'amuser un peu
et s'enfiler des grillades
avant qu'il y en ait plus.
- C'est une grosse affaire, Carv.
- Je sais.
Et nous, on joue à cache-cache
avec ce fils de pute, on tape à la machine,
on prend des photos
de connards à chapeaux.
- C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
- C'est de la merde.
Moi, je dis, on y va. Maintenant.
On va dans ces tours,
et on leur fout les boules.
Je déconne pas.
Faut qu'ils sachent à qui ils ont affaire,
ces fils de pute.
Tu viens ?
- Je te suis.
- Carv ?
Pourquoi pas ?
On y va.
Allez.
Planquez tout. Les keufs.
Les keufs, tirez-vous.
Viens là, toi. Viens, où tu vas ?
Sois pas malpoli. Les mains en l'air.
Pose ça.
- Lâche ça ! À terre !
- Les mains en l'air.
Me regarde pas
comme si je parlais pas ta langue.
T'as une seringue ? Un truc qui pique ?
Non ? C'est quoi, ça ?
T'as quoi dans les poches ?
Tu sais quoi ? Baisse ton froc.
Baisse ton froc et allonge-toi par terre.
Par terre, bordel !
Écarte, connard.
Cool, tes pompes.
Pense à quelque chose de gai.
Pourquoi vous allez pas
faire les mariolles ailleurs ?
Bons à rien.
Bouge pas.
Allez dire à Barksdale
qui c'est qui commande, dans ces tours.
Parce qu'on va revenir.
- Y en a marre !
- Va te faire foutre !
On revient dans une heure
arrêter les revendeurs.
On verra bien.
- Foutaises.
- Bouge pas, toi.
C'est dégueulasse. Il a rien fait.
Je peux vous aider ?
- Dégage, connard.
- Je fais rien.
Vraiment ? Je t'en donnerai, du rien !
- Mon oeil.
- Tu regarderas plus les gens de traviole.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais, là ?
Tu saignes sur ma bagnole ?
Tire-toi.
C'est quoi, ton problème ?
T'as vu d'où ça venait ?
Merde.
Va à la radio.
1 1-35. C'est une urgence.
771 Franklin, dans la cour.
Fils de pute !
Il y a des coups de feu. On a besoin d'aide.
Je suis touché ! Urgence.
Un agent blessé !
Merde !
- Allô ?
- T'as vu lejournal ?
- Quoi ?
- Va chercher lejournal.
Salut, les enfants.
Oh, non.
T'es content, connard ?
Témoin à charge assassiné
McNulty !
Il est où, bordel ?
Il a été détaché aux Stups, major...
Je sais où il a été détaché. Je le sais, ça !
Oui, major.
- Où est-il en ce moment ?
- Je peux le biper.
Sortez ce putain de bureau de mon service.
Je ne veux pas du bureau de ce connard
dans mon service.
C'est le bureau de Crutchfield.
De Crutchfield ?
McNulty est ici.
- C'est quoi, cette histoire ?
- T'as pas lu le journal ?
- Juste la page des sports.
- Regarde la une.
- Qu'est-ce qui va lui arriver ?
- Je vais te dire un truc.
S'il se fait choper en train d'enculer
la femme de l'adjoint,
je donne plus cher de sa peau
que s'il est impliqué là-dedans.
Lieutenant.
J'ai vu l'article dans le journal,
je veux que vous sachiez que je n'ai rien...
- Ils nous ont attaqués.
- Qui ?
Les Blacks de la cité.
Qu'est-ce vous y foutiez
à deux heures du mat' ?
Du terrain, notre boulot de policier.
- Votre boulot de policier ?
- Oui.
Il y a un môme de 14 ans à l'hôpital
dans un état critique mais stable,
et deux témoins qui disent que l'un de vous
I'a frappé en traître avec son flingue.
- Non.
- Sa mère est à l'l.G.S.
en train de déposer
une plainte pour brutalité,
ce sera la quatrième contre Herc
en deux ans.
- Toutes rejetées.
- Mais vraies.
On pensait que...
J'ai perdu une voiture.
Deux gilets pare-balles
qui ont brûlé dedans,
deux radios portatives, un flingue,
et ce crétin qui va être en arrêt maladie
pendant une ou deux semaines.
Tout ça pour quoi ?
Qu'avez-vous appris
en allant à la cité Franklin
à 2 h du mat' pour faire du terrain ?
Quelle information pertinente
avez-vous tiré de tout ça ?
Vous aurez l'l.G.S. sur le dos
d'ici cet après-midi,
alors je vous conseille de vous concerter,
ou il y aura assez de preuves contre vous
pour passer en procès.
Maintenant,
je veux savoir qui a frappé le môme.
Moi.
Pourquoi ?
Il m'a énervé.
Non, Pryzbylewski, il ne vous a pas énervé.
Il représentait une menace pour vous-même
et vos coéquipiers.
Je ne fais que supposer, mais peut-être...
qu'on l'a vu s'emparer d'une bouteille
et menacer Hauk et Carver,
qui avaient tous deux été blessés
par des projectiles.
Plutôt que d'utiliser une arme mortelle,
vous avez peut-être choisi
d'ordonner au jeune de lâcher la bouteille.
Peut-être que lorsqu'il vous a menacé
avec celle-ci,
vous avez utilisé une torche,
et non la crosse de votre arme de service,
pour neutraliser le suspect.
Mémorisez cette version.
Si vous merdez en parlant
aux types de l'lnspection,
je ne pourrai plus rien pour vous.
- Décalez les interpellations à 15 h.
- Et l'affaire Gillette ?
On repousse aussi le procès Gillette.
Accompagne-moi, je suis en retard.
- C'était pas moi.
- Tu es cité dans l'article.
Le journaliste avait déjà écrit son article
quand il m'a appelé.
Que voulais-tu que je dise ?
Que ce n'était pas un témoin ?
Qu'il n'a pas témoigné à mon procès ?
Quoi ?
Tu crois que les gens ne le savent pas ?
Les avocats, les greffiers, les jurés,
tout le monde en parle.
- Je suis dans la merde, Votre Honneur.
- Que veux-tu que j'y fasse ?
J'ai appelé l'adjoint, pas la presse.
Je dois y aller.
- Tu aurais dû les laisser se débrouiller.
- J'aurais eu des ennuis.
Je suis leur chef.
De toute façon,
on ne dénonce pas ses hommes à l'l.G.S.
Ça ne se fait pas.
Même s'ils envoient un môme de 14 ans
aux soins intensifs ?
Cette affaire, c'est...
Retire-toi de l'affaire.
- Comment ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Mais tu ne peux pas perdre
si tu ne joues pas.
On dit plutôt qu'on ne peut pas gagner
si on ne joue pas.
La police ne veut pas résoudre cette affaire.
On te fourgue des types incompétents
ou indignes de confiance.
Exact.
Si tu en fais trop et que ça remue la merde,
c'est toi qui prends.
Exact.
Si tu n'en fais pas assez et qu'il n'y a pas
d'arrestations, tu prends aussi.
Exact.
C'est un jeu truqué.
Mais tu ne peux pas perdre
si tu ne joues pas.
Tout le monde au trou.
Hé !
Hé, petits cons !
Police !
- Allô ?
- Lieutenant Daniels ?
Oui.
Qui était-ce ?
L'agent en faction à l'hôpital.
Que s'est-il passé ?
- Il a perdu un oeil.
- Qui ?
Le môme. Celui de 14 ans.
On devrait déją avoir la dope.
Ils préparent les doses.
D'habitude, elles sont déją prźtes,
mais cette fois, non.
Tu me files un échantillon ?
- Plus tard.
- Plus tard ?
Un échantillon ?
Neuf heures du mat' et tu veux déją ta dose.
Casse-toi. Bordel.
Pourquoi tu parles comme ēa ?
Quoi, ą cet enculé de junkie ?
Tu le pompes toute la journée
et tu le traites comme un chien ?
- Tu me proposes quoi ?
- Je sais pas.
- Le traite pas comme de la merde.
- Il le fait tout seul.
C'est un putain de junkie.
Et toi, t'es un putain de dealer.
Oui ? Et alors ?
Le client est toujours roi ?
Ici, c'est la cité.
Nos clients sont tous des barges.
Vaut mieux rien leur donner.
Pourquoi ? Pourquoi pas ?
Partout ailleurs,
les clients sont pas pris pour des cons.
Les escroqueries,
les mensonges, les arnaques.
- Pourquoi les traiter comme ēa ?
- Parce que c'est des junkies.
Ouais, mais c'est pas la peine
de les traiter comme ēa.
Me dis pas qu'on peut pas dealer
sans se casser la gueule,
sans se tuer,
sans se traiter comme des chiens.
Sans ēa,
on n'aurait pas les keufs sur le dos
toutes les cinq minutes,
- ą nous faire chier sans arrźt.
- Ouais, putain.
Les keufs s'intéresseraient
aux renois qui se défoncent ?
Ą la cité ?
Ils viennent
quand un mec s'est fait zigouiller.
Ils sont juste bons ą ēa, récupérer les morts.
- Messieurs, bien le bonjour.
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Je vous apporte un peu de classe
dans mon sac.
Regardez ēa.
Je te le laisse pour cinq dollars, alors ?
Cinq dollars, et tu seras classe ą mort.
Lui, on le connaīt.

HEURE
"Le roi sera toujours le roi." -- D'Angelo
Et pour l'émeute ?
On a trois témoignages
affirmant que le policier a frappé
sans avoir été provoqué par le jeune.
Vous savez ce que ēa veut dire.
On va avoir toute la population ą dos.
Qu'en dit le procureur ?
Il parle de jury d'accusation.
Il joue les Ponce Pilate.
Le jury ne nous inculpera pas,
et lui, il ne se mouille pas.
- Et s'il nous inculpe ?
- Il ne le fera pas.
Les casiers des trois témoins
rivalisent en longueur.
Trafic de drogue, d'armes, agressions,
et re-trafic de drogue.
Des petits trouducs
qui veulent salir la police.
Quand bien mźme, lieutenant,
vous allez revoir
vos méthodes qui vous ont amenés
ą envoyer trois agents en civil
faire des interrogatoires dans la cité
ą deux heures du matin.
Bien.
Je suppose que vos hommes
ont une aide juridique ?
Oui.
M. I'adjoint, je demanderais,
en attendant la décision du jury,
que Pryzbylewski soit contraint
ą du travail administratif.
On l'occupera,
mais il ne devrait pas aller sur le terrain
avant qu'on ait le verdict.
Ce serait avouer qu'on a eu tort.
Je crois qu'on devrait envoyer le message
qu'il n'a rien fait de mal.
Un gamin de 14 ans y a perdu un oeil.
Et deux des nōtres ont été blessés.
Et pour cause.
Ils nous tiraient dessus, bordel.
Bobby, qu'est-ce que t'en penses ?
Interdiction de patrouiller
jusqu'ą ce qu'un verdict soit rendu.
Trčs bien, on attend que le jury se décide.
Lieutenant. Un instant, s'il vous plaīt.
Que s'est-il passé ?
Saviez-vous qu'ils allaient dans la cité
sans renforts ?
Si je réponds oui,
c'est que j'ai merdé.
Si je réponds non,
j'avoue que mes gars méritent d'źtre jugés.
Vous voulez vraiment une réponse ?
J'ai merdé.
C'est bien que vous couvriez le service.
Je me fous du service.
Je ne fais que défendre mon équipe.
Ce que le major Valchek veut dire,
c'est qu'il vous est reconnaissant
de couvrir aussi l'inspecteur Pryzbylewski.
- Mźme s'il est nul.
- Il devrait pas patrouiller.
Que dire. Ce gamin a besoin
d'un guide, d'un chef.
Stan veut dire
que s'il avait un nouveau chef,
pour se remettre...
Une nouvelle unité, un nouveau lieutenant.
- Ēa pourrait le remettre d'aplomb.
- Je comprends bien qu'il a merdé.
Vraiment.
C'est pour cela que je vous dis
que je vous suis redevable
de le couvrir devant le jury d'accusation.
Et pour vous en remercier, ils vous donnent
deux véhicules banalisés
et un fourgon de surveillance.
Et si vous avez besoin d'hommes
pendant que les vōtres ont affaire ą l'l.G.S.,
ce sera avec joie.
Lieutenant.
Donc on pourrait s'entendre, Valchek ?
Tout ą fait.
C'est toujours un plaisir de vous voir.
Un mal nécessaire.
- Pardon ?
- Valchek.
Est-ce impudent de vous demander
en quoi il est nécessaire ?
Merci de ne pas avoir lāché Pryzbylewski.
En cas contraire, j'aurais eu des ennuis
avec Valchek et la Ville.
Je vous en suis reconnaissant.
Ce Barksdale,
c'est un vrai caļd.
Arrźter les dealers n'y fera rien.
Et depuis cet article concernant le témoin...
Ce n'est pas un problčme.
Concentrez-vous sur votre enquźte.
Trois semaines ą fond sur le terrain
et ce sera réglé.
Quelques arrestations,
un peu de came sur la table.
C'est tout ce qu'on veut.
Il est absolument faux de déclarer
que ce meurtre a été commis
parce que la victime
avait témoigné dans une affaire précédente.
Toute déclaration affirmant le contraire
est sans fondement.
Selon vous, cet homme n'a pas été tué
par suite de son témoignage ?
Nous pensons que...
Il est vraisemblable...
Nous pensons plutōt que M. Gant
a trouvé la mort
par suite d'un conflit de rue.
Lequel, bien sūr, n'aurait aucun lien
avec le fait qu'il ait témoigné
dans une toute autre affaire
réglée il y a quelque temps.
Mais vous n'avez toujours arrźté personne ?
Non.
Bunk, tu devrais avoir honte.
Tu t'attendais ą quoi ?
Qu'il prenne le micro,
qu'il pousse Rawls
et qu'il incite tout Baltimore
ą s'indigner qu'un témoin
puisse źtre tué de sang-froid.
Ēa ressemble ą ce que toi, tu leur aurais dit.
Quinze jours qu'on le suit
et toujours pas de photo.
Y a de quoi avoir honte.
Hé, Pat.
On a une mission pour vous.
Comme quoi ?
Il nous faut une photo de ce Barksdale.
Qu'on sache de quoi il a l'air.
- Va voir les gars du F.B.I.
- C'est ēa, le problčme.
Barksdale, majeur, n'a jamais été arrźté
donc ils ne l'ont pas en photo.
Son casier de mineur a été détruit,
donc pas de photo lą non plus.
Alors t'es baisé.
Bien dit.
Mais vu qu'on s'est tous levés pour venir
bosser aujourd'hui, essayons autre chose.
On sait, par le dossier d'assurance sociale
de sa mčre
que Barksdale a grandi
dans la cité Franklin, d'accord ?
Je me suis rappelé,
connaissant un peu
les tours du quartier ouest,
que dans la cité,
des photos avaient été prises
de chaque résident, par mesure de sécurité.
- Est-ce exact, inspecteur Greggs ?
- Oui.
Alors tu veux qu'on aille lą-bas
- et qu'on te ramčne sa photo.
- Voilą.
Tu sais, toi et moi, on se comprend.
Comme deux chevaux harnachés ensemble.
Tu sais quoi ? Fais-le toi-mźme.
Si tu préfčres rester ici
ą éplucher de vieilles affaires de meurtre,
méticuleusement,
histoire de trouver de nouvelles pistes.
C'est un travail chiant, minutieux,
mais si tu refuses d'y aller, on échange.
Laisse tomber, Patrick. Allons-y.
- Quelle belle tirade.
- Un vrai leader sommeille en moi.
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- On n'a plus rien.
- Quoi ?
- On n'a plus de capsules rouges.
Stink dit que ēa arrive demain.
De la fraīche ?
La merde qu'on leur a refilée
Ies fout ą cran.
Mais mate, ils continuent ą en acheter.
Oui, il leur en faut deux fois plus
pour planer deux fois moins.
C'était quoi, ēa ?
La tour bouge pas comme ēa.
Juste horizontalement ou verticalement.
- Mais on joue pas ą ēa.
- Regarde le plateau, on joue aux dames.
- Aux dames ?
- Ouais.
Vous jouez aux dames
avec des pičces d'échec ?
Et alors ?
On n'a pas les pions qu'il faut.
Mais les échecs, c'est mieux.
Et alors ?
Non, attends.
Vous savez pas y jouer, hein ?
- Et alors ?
- Rien.
- Je vous apprends si ēa vous intéresse.
- Mais non, arrźte.
- On jouait, lą.
- Cool, mec, je veux voir ēa.
On joue pas aux dames
avec des pičces d'échec.
Comme tu veux.
Bon, regardez, c'est simple.
Celui-lą ?
C'est le roi.
La pičce la plus puissante.
Si tu prends le roi ą ton adversaire,
t'as gagné.
Mais il va essayer de faire pareil
donc faut que tu le protčges.
Bon, le roi, il se déplace d'une case
dans n'importe quelle direction,
parce que c'est le roi.
Comme ēa, d'accord ?
Mais que d'une case ą la fois,
et les autres de son gang,
ils le protčgent.
Ils sont si rapides qu'il n'a pas ą baliser.
- Comme ton oncle.
- Ouais, comme lui.
Celle-lą ? C'est la reine.
Elle est rusée, c'est de la bombe.
Elle se déplace comme elle veut,
de plusieurs cases.
Elle est super puissante.
Ēa me fait penser ą Stringer.
Et celle-lą, c'est la tour.
C'est comme notre planque.
Elle bouge comme ēa.
Et comme ēa.
Mais les planques, ēa bouge pas.
Réfléchis.
La came a bougé
combien de fois cette semaine ?
Et ą chaque fois qu'on bouge,
faut qu'on soit
toujours un peu plus prudents.
Oui, c'est vrai.
Bon. Et ces petites merdes pouraves, lą ?
Celles-lą.
C'est les pions. Les soldats.
Ils avancent comme ēa,
mais que d'une case ą la fois,
sauf quand ils se battent.
Dans ce cas, c'est...
ou comme ēa.
Ils aiment źtre sur la ligne de front
pour se battre.
Alors comment on peut devenir roi ?
Ēa marche pas comme ēa.
Le roi sera toujours le roi, pigé ?
Chacun reste ą sa place,
sauf les pions.
Bon, si un pion
arrive ą traverser l'échiquier,
il prend la place de la reine.
Et comme j'ai dit,
la reine, c'est de la bombe.
Elle va oł elle veut.
Bon, alors,
si j'arrive ą traverser l'échiquier, j'ai gagné ?
Si t'arrives ą choper le roi
de ton adversaire, lą, t'as gagné.
Si j'arrive ą faire ēa,
je deviens le boss.
Non, ēa marche pas comme ēa.
Les pions, dans le jeu,
ils se font vite liquider.
Ils virent assez vite.
Ą moins qu'ils soient rusés.
Des micros ą bobine. Vous y croyez ?
Ēa remonte ą la préhistoire.
Ensuite, ēa va źtre quoi ?
Des huit pistes ? Des phonographes ?
C'est n'importe quoi.
Va falloir contacter le F.B.I.
Ils ont des micros sans fil trčs légers.
Le bureau du procureur aussi.
S'il fait chaud, ils vont le voir.
Mźme s'ils me fouillent ą moitié, je suis cuit.
Des micros ą bobine.
Je rźve.
On peut pas l'envoyer dans la cité
avec cette merde sur lui.
Ēa marchera pas.
Sans déc.
McNulty et la fille,
Ia salope des Stups, ils sont dessus.
- Qui est votre coéquipier ?
- McNulty.
Mais on n'a rien ą voir ensemble
et on tient ą en rester lą.
Major, je suis la cinquičme roue
d'un carrosse qui ne va nulle part.
Reprenez-moi.
Bientōt.
Vous źtes mes yeux et mes oreilles
dans ce bordel, d'accord ?
Je ne veux plus de surprises,
comme cet article de presse.
Si McNulty a prévu
d'autres merdes du genre,
il faut que je puisse avertir l'adjoint
avant que ēa explose.
Ensuite, vous reviendrez ici avec une prime.
Pas mal, non ?
Lieutenant.
Dites ą Carver et Prez de revenir demain,
mais Prez reste ici.
Vous lui interdisez de faire quoi que ce soit.
Si le bātiment prend feu,
je lui interdis de sortir.
- Et Herc ?
- Congé maladie, au moins jusqu'ą lundi.
Je me demande ce qu'il faut faire
pour źtre viré de la police.
Continue comme ēa et tu le sauras.
Oł sont les feuilles de sortie ?
Derričre le panneau.
Vous źtes allés boire un verre ?
On a ta photo, te bile pas, McNulty.
C'est Barksdale ?
Avon Barksdale.
Ēa m'étonnerait.
Écoutez-moi bien.
C'est ce putain d'Avon Barksdale.
C'est le nom qui allait avec cette photo.
Excuse-moi de trouver ēa bizarre,
mais il me semble voir un Blanc
dans la quarantaine.
Si tu veux une autre photo,
donne-moi un autre nom.
C'est le seul Avon Barksdale
qu'ils avaient dans leurs dossiers.
T'as pris tes clopes ?
Et bonne journée, bordel.
C'est peut-źtre un Blanc.
Non, sans blague.
Qu'est-ce qu'on sait sur lui ?
"Avon Barksdale.
"31 ans.
"Né ą l'hōpital Provident,
dans le quartier ouest,
"mčre : Willette Jackson Barksdale,
"pčre : inconnu.
"Est allé ą l'école publique."
L'adresse correspond ą la cité
oł il contrōle le trafic de drogue.
Aucune trace de lui nulle part.
Un peu comme s'il n'existait pas.
Jamais eu d'employeur.
Jamais payé d'impōts.
Pas de voiture ą son nom, pas de permis.
Pas d'enfants.
Pas d'arrestations non plus.
Mais un indic nous a vaguement dit
qu'il avait habité
différents appartements dans le comté.
Pas d'adresse précise, bien sūr.
Il passe de fille en fille,
a peut-źtre une autre petite amie
ą New York.
Il aime faire de l'exercice
et il participait ą des combats de boxe
quand il était jeune.
On est sur son cas depuis 15 jours
et ą dire vrai, on sait que dalle.
Des combats de boxe ?
Comment tu sais ēa ?
Je sais pas.
D'un dossier des Narcos, je crois.
Ou alors d'un indic
qui m'avait certifié le connaītre ą l'époque.
Donc tu prends tout en note ?
Ouais, absolument tout.
- Hé, j'ai de la bombe.
- J'ai des bleues.
C'est de la bonne.
Ēa vient.
J'ai des bleues. Ēa t'intéresse ?
Ēa vient.
- Des bleues.
- Des rouges.
- Des rouges.
- Deux pour 10 $.
Des bleues, j'ai des bleues.
Gardez Cet Endroit Propre
Enchaīne les directs.
Un direct du droit.
Gauche, droite, gauche, droite.
Deux crochets.
J'aurais quelques questions pour toi, Mack.
Enchaīne, balance les coups.
Ą qui tu t'intéresses ?
- Barksdale.
- Qui ēa ?
Avon Barksdale.
- Jamais entendu parler.
- Et voilą.
Il contrōle totalement la cité du Westside.
Impliqué dans une douzaine de meurtres,
mais on n'a rien sur lui.
- Avon comment ?
- Barksdale.
Si tu le dis.
Les Narcos ont quelques infos sur lui.
Les Narcos ont quelques infos sur lui.
Pas de casier judiciaire, aucune arrestation.
Je m'occupe
des affaires de drogues depuis 98.
Je peux vous dire qu'on n'a rien sur lui.
Ēa,
c'est ce qui va égayer ma semaine.
Regardez ēa.
- Quoi ?
- C'était quoi, ēa ?
Contre la porte.
Le coup d'une carričre.
Mais mes supérieurs s'en foutent.
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi ?
Parce qu'aucun de ces nazes
ne s'appelle Oussama.
Bon, comment je peux t'aider ?
Il me faudrait quelques micros.
Sans fil avec enregistrement ą distance.
C'est tout ?
De lą oł je viens, on est juste heureux
d'źtre au XXe sičcle.
Qui chapeaute l'affaire,
que j'en avertisse mon chef ?
Daniels, des Stups.
Trčs bien, ēa marche.
Putain ! Fait chier, cette pluie.
Bon, vous savez quoi faire.
- Tous contre le mur, putain, magnez-vous.
- Allez, bougez-vous.
En file indienne. J'ai pas de temps ą perdre.
On a des rouges, des échantillons. Derričre.
Dépźche, fais-les passer de l'autre cōté.
Pourquoi vous me regardez ?
Bougez votre cul de lą.
Je veux de ēa, c'est de la bonne.
Allez, avancez.
- Vous avez vu ēa ?
- Dis donc.
La troisičme en partant du fond.
C'est leur planque.
Ils sont vraiment trop nazes.
C'est trop facile.
Tes gamins ont quel āge ?
Mike a huit ans, Sean en a dix.
Pas facile ą ces āges-lą.
Ouais, pas facile, mais tu sais...
- Tu les vois tous les combien ?
- Un week-end sur deux.
Je veux plus, mais elle s'y oppose.
- Pourquoi ?
- Pour se venger.
Pour se venger ?
T'as dū faire le con.
- Je dis ēa comme ēa.
- C'est vrai.
C'est toujours comme ēa.
Quand une femme veut se venger,
elle a une bonne raison.
D'oł te vient cette sagesse
alors que t'as une vie de merde ?
C'est bien ce que je me demande.
Et toi ? Tu as déją été mariée ?
Quoi ?
- Si tu lui dis rien, je vais le faire.
- Quoi ?
Si t'es un chien,
tu aboies aprčs la mauvaise chatte.
Quoi, je suis un chien maintenant ?
- Miaou.
- Bubbles.
Je sors avec des femmes.
Encore un point commun. Moi aussi.
Donc tout le monde l'avait deviné sauf moi ?
Il n'y avait rien ą deviner.
Je l'ai dit ą tout le monde.
- J'ai dū louper la conférence de presse.
- Je préfčre ēa que d'avoir dix gars
qui me font du plat sans arrźt.
- Les flics sont des chiens.
- Ouais.
C'est pas comme si je me baladais
avec un badge qui disait "gouine"
ou un truc du genre.
- Je sais que c'est pas flagrant.
- Ēa, c'est sūr.
Mais je tenais ą ce que ce soit clair
pour tout le monde.
- J'aurais dū m'en douter.
- Te douter de quoi ?
J'ai déją fait équipe avec une autre femme
qui en arrachait, juste une seule.
- Une lesbienne.
- Ouais.
Au début, t'es dans ta voiture, ą ton poste,
seule, tu fais ton boulot.
- La plupart des femmes n'en sortent pas.
- C'est vrai.
Sauf si elles ont un coéquipier.
Elles ont peur, physiquement.
- C'est obligé.
- Mais pas toi ?
Au début, si.
Mais je te parle de la peur du débutant,
tu me suis ?
Mais je savais que ēa durerait pas.
Tu te fais casser la gueule une ou deux fois,
mais tu réalises
que c'est pas la fin du monde, pas vrai ?
La plupart des femmes flics
préfčrent ne rien savoir.
Certains policiers aussi.
Le danger leur fait peur.
- C'est parce que t'es gay ?
- Je sais pas.
Mais c'est pas ēa, le boulot de flic ?
Tout ce que je sais, c'est que j'adore ēa.
- Ēa vous fera 3,20 $.
- Gardez la monnaie.
Merci, bonne soirée.
Chez Orlando - Club pour Messieurs
Dee arrive.
Oł ēa va, tout ēa ?
L'argent. Il va oł ?
Il y a 22 000 $ ou 24 000 $, plus ou moins.
Des pavillons ?
Putain, mec ! Ēa marche ą fond.
Je crois pas qu'on ait déją
fait autant dans la cour.
Avant qu'ils aient les allocs.
Tu te débrouilles comme un chef, Dee.
On fera encore mieux
une fois qu'on en aura de la fraīche.
Ēa sera toujours la mźme.
- Quoi ?
- Y a pas de fraīche qui arrive.
On va vendre la mźme
dans des capsules différentes.
On la coupera avec un anesthésiant
ou de la caféine, mais ce sera la mźme.
String, les gars se plaignent déją,
- ils disent que ēa leur fait rien.
- Je m'en doute.
Mais c'est partout pareil.
Tu peux vendre n'importe quoi
et dire que c'est de l'héro.
Si elle est pure, on va la vendre.
Coupée, on en vend deux fois plus.
Tu sais pourquoi ?
Parce qu'un junkie, il est prźt ą se shooter
avec n'importe quoi.
C'est fou, non ?
On leur vend de la merde
et on se fait plus de fric.
Le gouvernement peut faire ce qu'il veut,
ēa change rien pour nous.
Ce business-lą, Dee, c'est pour toujours.
Tiens, ēa, c'est pour toi.
Achčte-toi un truc
qui te fait vraiment plaisir.
Merci.
Bon.
Tu te souviens de moi ?
Si je me souviens de toi ?
J'étais lą l'autre jour, tu voulais un verre.
- Et j'en ai eu un ?
- Je crains que non.
Pourquoi je me souviendrais de toi ?
Si tu veux que ce soit le cas,
tu t'y prends pas comme il faut.
Bon.
Comme d'habitude.
Le club appartient ą mon oncle.
T'es de la famille d'Orlando ?
Non.
Orlando, c'est une couverture, tu me suis ?
C'est mon oncle qui dirige tout ēa.
- Tu viens d'oł ?
- D'ici.
- De Baltimore.
- Ēa, je m'en doute, mais d'oł ?
Tu connais Turner Station ?
Aprčs Dundalk, prčs de Point.
Point. Alors, t'es une fille de la campagne.
- Du comté, tu veux dire.
- D'oł je viens, le comté, c'est la campagne.
Et d'oł tu viens ?
Alors...
tu travailles avec ton oncle ?
Je suis son bras droit.
Je vois ēa.
Tu viens avec nous ?
- Non.
- Pourquoi ?
Tu crois que ēa sert ą rien ?
Vous allez cueillir
que des petits dealers et des gamins.
Bingo.
Oł tu as trouvé ēa ?
Regardez-moi ce petit zonard.
Ēa le fait, non ?
Approche, que je voie ēa.
L'inspecteur Sydnor en zonard.
C'est la derničre mode
dans la cité du Westside.
Un futal Versace complčtement détruit,
un sweat-shirt Ralph Lauren dégueu.
- Et ton micro ?
- Dans mon calebut.
Ils vont pas aller le chercher lą, non ?
Je me demande, Sydnor,
si tu te dandines comme ēa,
ils vont peut-źtre se jeter dessus.
Va te faire foutre.
Deux jours que je suis crade,
quatre jours que je me rase pas.
Lą, je suis un vrai zonard qui schlingue.
Bubbs.
T'en penses quoi ?
C'est votre taupe ?
Ouais.
Il te semble assez débraillé ?
Les fringues, ēa va,
mais il est peut-źtre pas encore assez crade.
- C'est quoi, ēa ?
- Mon alliance.
Merde, ta femme, c'est la dope.
Un vrai camé l'aurait déją vendue.
Tu serais déją mort.
Tu pourrais perdre une dizaine de kilos,
porter des dents en or,
des bleus sur les mains.
Je devrais peut-źtre aller me camer
pendant un ou deux ans, non ?
- Revenir quand ce sera plus convaincant ?
- Je te donne juste mon avis.
Plus t'auras l'air déchiré,
plus tu seras crédible.
Si tu vas dans la cité,
ils vont t'inspecter de prčs.
Et mes pompes ?
Je suis sūr qu'elles sont parfaites,
elles sont plus que niquées.
Fais-moi voir ēa.
Vous voyez ?
Quand t'es vraiment de la cité,
tu marches sur des soldats morts.
- Des soldats morts ?
- Ouais, des capsules vides.
Tu peux pas źtre de lą-bas
sans marcher constamment lą-dessus.
Pour savoir si t'as affaire ą un vrai camé,
t'as qu'ą inspecter ses semelles.
Bon.
Faites-le danser sur du verre
avant de l'y envoyer.
Ou on est morts.
T'es vexé ?
Un peu.
Merde.
Quatre deals de la main ą la main,
deux pour moi, deux pour Bubbs
dont je peux témoigner.
- De qui ?
- Surtout de gamins.
Des petits rappeurs.
C'est toujours ēa.
Ils ont l'air plutōt organisés, Kima.
Si tu files pas de fric
ą un gars qui est puissant,
Ia came que t'achčtes
vient d'un gars sans importance.
Tu veux y retourner ?
On les a tous faits.
On n'est pas censés aller se piquer ?
Ouais, tirons-nous d'ici.
Tiens, tiens.
Tu as vu ą qui allait le fric aprčs le deal ?
Non.
On n'a vu que des petits dealers.
Mais encore une fois,
tu nous avais prévenus.
C'est pas ce que j'ai dit.
Mais ą bien y réfléchir...
- Il ne reste plus que vous ?
- Je...
J'ai pas réussi ą vous trouver
alors je leur ai dit de partir.
C'est pas plus mal.
Je leur annoncerai demain.
Quoi ?
J'ai dit ą Burrell qu'on avait des preuves.
Pour les petits dealers.
Il veut qu'on fasse une descente
et des saisies
dans la cité mercredi aprčs-midi.
- Lieutenant.
- Je sais.
Il croit que ēa nous permettra
de coincer Avon Barksdale ?
Pour l'instant, on a eu affaire
ą des dealers sans importance.
Réunissez tout ce que vous avez
des deals de main ą la main
pour qu'on obtienne
des mandats de perquisition.
Qu'on inspecte quelques lieux.
Mais lesquels ?
On sait que les pavillons
leur servent de planque.
Eh bien voilą.
Lieutenant, ces gars changent de planque
tous les deux jours.
Écoutez-moi,
les gars d'en haut veulent voir de l'action.
Alors dans quelques jours,
je vais leur en donner.
Putain.
Désolé. C'est le moment d'agir.
- Le préfet adjoint est con ou quoi ?
- Non.
C'est n'importe quoi.
On arrźte quelques gars,
ils passent devant un juge
qui les relāche le lendemain.
Et ēa fout en l'air notre enquźte.
Il veut quoi ?
Qu'on gratte du papier
pour avoir des mandats de perquisition.
- On va y passer toute la nuit.
- Pas moi.
- On t'attend quelque part ?
- Non, mais je refuse.
Je ne participerai pas ą ce sabotage. Désolé.
Je sais que c'est ton supérieur.
Tu peux pas refuser.
Mais c'est trop pour moi.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais lą ?
- Je pensais ą un truc.
- Je peux entrer ?
- Non.
Non ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
On ne te dit jamais "non" ?
Désolé. J'aurais dū t'appeler.
Comment on copie un pager ?
- Quoi ?
- C'est ce qui m'intéresse.
Tu te pointes le soir chez moi
pour me demander ēa ?
Ils ont des pagers, non ?
Tout bon dealer a un portable
mais ces gars-lą ont des pagers.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux faire ?
Bunk et moi, on arrźte le petit Barksdale
qui a un pager Motorola.
Et on lui rend, pour qu'il se doute de rien.
Tu veux en faire une copie ?
Est-ce qu'on peut le faire
sans en informer les fabricants ?
Lis ēa.
- C'est quoi ?
- La déclaration que tu dois remplir.
En la faisant signer par un juge,
tu peux copier un pager.
Putain.
Une pičce probante, en plus du reste.
Tu dois prouver au juge que toutes
les autres méthodes d'enquźte ont échoué.
Il faut aussi qu'un supérieur
appuie ta demande,
vu que ēa peut vous entraīner
ą devoir faire aussi
des enregistrements, mises sur écoute.
Daniels ne s'y opposera pas.
Daniels aura ta peau.
Merci.
- C'est tout ?
- Quoi ?
Non.
Que je comprenne bien.
Marié, tu trouvais romantique
de m'emmener ą l'hōtel.
Maintenant que tu es célibataire,
tu débarques chez moi
pour me demander les procédures légales
pour copier un pager.
Ouais, c'est ēa.
Non.
D'accord, j'ai compris.
Et toi ?
Comme si ēa t'intéressait.
T'es un vrai connard, McNulty.
Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?
- Il t'en reste combien ?
- 50 ou 60 doses.
On devrait déją avoir la came.
Dis ą Wallace de rebiper Stinkum.
Tu veux quelque chose ą bouffer ?
Ouais, un Caraļbes.
Aboule le fric.
Sans déc.
Je pensais que tu me l'offrais.
T'avais tout faux, je suis pas banquier.
T'es aussi con pourtant.
J'espčre que tu m'as donné assez.
- Pas de mayo, super épicé et un soda.
- Ēa marche.
- Il va chercher ą grailler ?
- Oui.
Sans rien me dire ? Putain, je crčve la dalle.
- Vas-y, crčve.
- Sans déc.
La dope arrive.
Stink, ēa gaze ?
Ēa gaze ? Dans dix minutes.
- Dix ?
- Ouais.
Ēa roule.
Qui est lą ?
Vous surveillez, compris ?
Viens par lą.
Ą genoux. Ą genoux, connard.
Ą genoux, bordel. Bouge pas, connard.
Ą genoux. T'entends, connard ?
Oł vous la planquez ?
- On n'a rien ici.
- Elle est oł ?
Bordel ! Putain, ma jambe !
Tu vas parler, le nain ?
- Dans la cuisine, sous l'évier.
- Va la chercher.
Y en a pour 20 000 $. Tirons-nous d'ici.
Y en a pour 20 000 $. Tirons-nous d'ici.
- C'est tout ?
- Omar, allez.
Qu'est-ce que...
Bouffon.
Merde !
Allez, on se tire.
Merde !
Allez, Poot.
Putain !
- Ton indic les a vus se faire rouler ?
- Ouais, en partie.
- Et il a relevé les plaques ?
- On peut compter sur Bubbles.
Écoutez.
Des agents viennent ą notre rencontre
sur le parking de la gare.
On part tous de lą
et on ne s'arrźte sous aucun prétexte.
Leurs guetteurs ne doivent pas avoir
le temps de les avertir.
Un problčme ?
Dans mon bureau.
- Je n'y vais pas.
- Vous refusez d'obéir ?
Je refuse de participer ą un raid
qui va tout faire foirer.
- Allez-y, écrivez un rapport.
- Vous croyez que ēa me plaīt ?
Le préfet adjoint aux opérations
me fait chier.
Et vous,
vous m'humiliez devant mes hommes.
Je ne tiens ą humilier personne.
- Enfilez votre pare-balles.
- Non.
J'ai une enquźte ą mener.
Dans ce cas, pourquoi
ne vous źtes-vous pas porté malade ?
Je ne suis pas malade.
Si, vous l'źtes.
Remplissez un formulaire 95
qui attestera que vous étiez malade.
Pour vous ōter de l'embarras ?
Allez, remplissez-le.
"Je ne participe pas au raid
parce que j'ai mal au ventre."
Ce raid ne servira ą rien.
Si vous voulez faire un travail
de pseudo-flic, allez-y.
On y va.
Je suis partant.
- Vous n'źtes pas encore remis.
- Si, patron.
Donnez-lui un gilet.
Non, y a pas que Stinkum
qui doit veiller ą la planque.
T'as la cour.
Tes gars doivent źtre prźts
ą recevoir la dope.
T'es censé źtre prźt et le couvrir.
Mais t'étais oł ?
Parti acheter des casse-dalle.
On t'en amčne pour 20 000 $, Dee,
et t'es pas lą pour la réceptionner.
Je pensais que quand la dope...
Non, justement, tu pensais ą rien
et maintenant, on passe pour des nazes.
Tu me suis ? Faut qu'on se venge.
Et en plus, tu peux rien me dire sur eux.
L'un d'eux s'appelait Omar.
- Omar ?
- J'ai entendu ce nom-lą.
- Et leur van était blanc.
- Ouais, je l'ai vu...
- Quelle marque ?
- Les keufs.
- Mauvaise porte.
- Ah ouais ?
Ouais, je l'ai mise ailleurs hier.
Vos mains en évidence.
Dégage. Les mains en évidence.
En l'air, sale enculé, en l'air. Tourne-toi.
On les met en l'air tout gentiment.
Police. Les mains en l'air.
J'ai dit : "En l'air !"
Tourne-toi. Les mains derričre la tźte.
C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
Allez, quoi, je faisais rien.
Allez, quoi.
Passe-lui les menottes, lui aussi.
Sale enculé, t'aimes ēa ?
T'aurais pas dū. T'en veux encore ?
Tu te défends plus ?
Enculé. Vas-y, joue au héros pour voir.
Maintenez-le au sol. Tenez-lui les bras !
Jambes écartées.
Ne m'oblige pas ą te foutre une branlée.
Allez !
Frappe-le. On touche pas ą un flic.
Ēa va pas, non ?
Tu veux toujours casser du flic ?
Vous auriez dū voir
la raclée qu'on leur a mise.
Rien. On n'a rien trouvé.
Si tu y vas ą l'aveugle, forcément.
Tu t'attendais ą quoi ?
Une journaliste aimerait filmer
les lieux qu'on a perquisitionnés.
Elle dit qu'elle aimerait filmer
tout ce qu'on a trouvé.
- Tout ce qu'on a trouvé ?
- Drogue, armes.
On a que dalle.
On voit que t'as jamais patrouillé.
Je vois.
- Désolé pour le retard.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Je voulais pas parler
devant la fille, celle des Stups.
Daniels a les mains sales.
Quoi ?
Celui qui chapeaute votre enquźte,
il a les mains sales.
T'en es sūr ?
Des gars de ta brigade ont voulu
qu'on enquźte sur lui l'an passé.
Pour une question d'intégrité.
Ils voulaient pas faire appel ą l'l.G.S.
Trop de fuites.
Et en plus, ils sont bons ą rien.
- C'est vrai.
- Vous avez fait une enquźte approfondie ?
On a épluché ses comptes
pendant deux mois.
Ce gars a quelques centaines de milliers
de trop en liquide,
pour un simple lieutenant.
Il les a peut-źtre gagnés au jeu.
Je suis sérieux.
Vous avez vérifié ?
Il a peut-źtre d'autres sources de revenus.
Peut-źtre. On n'a pas pu aller plus loin.
Pourquoi ēa ?
On a dit ą votre préfet adjoint
aux opérations ce qu'on avait sur lui.
- Burrell le sait ?
- Il nous a dit : "On s'en occupe."
On s'est retirés et on a attendu
qu'il se passe un truc.
- Et on a attendu.
- C'était il y a un an ?
Peut-źtre plus que ēa.
Et cet enculé
est encore aux commandes des Stups.
Alors, explique-moi un peu ēa.
Vu que tu bosses avec lui,
je me suis dit que je devais te le dire.
Merci.
Putain de truc.
Je m'en sors pas.
Je vais passer derričre,
je peux peut-ętre faire quelque chose.
Un, deux.
- Trois.
- Trois.
Merde.
Besoin d'aide ?
Bon, ŕ trois, on lui rčgle son sort,
ŕ cet enfoiré. Un, deux, trois.
J'en suis gęné pour vous.
Yo, Herc, je reprends mon souffle,
et je lui vire ses tiroirs d'un coup de pied.
Ça coince quelque part, lieutenant.
Rejoins Carver.
Un, deux, tu sais ce que tu as ŕ faire.
Mais qu'est-ce que...
Bordel. J'y arrive pas.
J'y arrivais un peu tout seul.
Il a dű se coincer dans la porte.
Ce bureau est bien vide ?
- Oui.
- Tu as vérifié ?
On n'arrivera jamais ŕ le faire entrer,
ŕ cette vitesse.
Quoi ?
Entrer ?
Entrer.
Putain, c'est incroyable.
Seigneur.

"ll n'y a qu'un pas d'ici au paradis."
-- Bubbles
Le dossier n'est pas trčs motivant.
Je sais qu'il n'a l'air de rien,
mais voyez ce que vous pouvez faire.
- On se fait des amis ?
- Pas encore.
J'ai passé la matinée
au tribunal pour enfants.
Les mômes savent qu'ils ne risquent rien
pour vente de drogue,
donc, chou blanc de ce côté.
Tu as essayé ?
Une joie de s'entendre dire
"Va te faire foutre" par un môme de 14 ans.
- Voilŕ notre meilleur espoir.
- Lui ?
Il a été pris en flagrant délit avec Bubbles.
Il a un casier long comme mon bras.
Bien. Premier cas. Mme Dawkins ?
L'État contre Marvin Browning,
Votre Honneur.
Pour vente de substance interdite,
ŕ savoir, d'héroďne,
et vente d'une substance interdite,
ŕ savoir, de cocaďne.
- Quantités ?
- Une capsule et une gélule respectivement.
Recommandations ?
L'État demande la détention,
le défendeur faisant l'objet d'une enquęte
et étant en outre
soumis ŕ une peine de cinq ans fermes
pour condamnations précédentes.
Demanderez-vous également
cinq ans fermes pour ce cas ?
Absolument, Votre Honneur.
Trčs bien, j'en tiendrai compte.
Ça l'a fait réagir, au moins.
Lieutenant, goűtez-moi ça.
Allez, on a quelque chose ŕ fęter.
Patrick prend sa retraite.
Chčre, chčre cervicale 6.
Je ne sens ni mon épaule, ni mon bras.
J'ai l'impression que mes doigts
appartiennent ŕ un autre enfoiré.
Mais grâce ŕ ça, je me tire de ce trou ŕ rats.
Avec 66 % de ma pension, et pas de préavis.
- Je suis parti.
- Ce petit Black t'a rendu service.
Le gosse se débattait comme une mule.
Tu devrais réfléchir un ou deux jours
avant d'envoyer les papiers.
Mon beau-frčre a un magasin de vidéo
ŕ Moravia.
Il se fait 14 000 $ par semaine,
dont 8 000 en porno.
Il cherche un partenaire.
Mais ils le déduiront de ta pension.
Si je le déclare, c'est sűr.
Je ne suis pas idiot.
Amuse-toi bien, lieutenant.
Qu'est-ce que tu as ?
Je vais te manquer, Augs ?
Qu'est-ce que je vais devenir, Paddy ?
Je vais te dire.
- Et si on se tirait tous les deux ?
- Que veux-tu dire ?
Ça ne fait mal qu'une minute.
Et ça peut arriver en dehors du service.
Je suis sérieux. Tu sais,
ces escaliers qui mčnent au sous-sol ?
- Oui.
- Il fait sombre, lŕ-bas.
Tu montes huit ou neuf marches,
tu lâches la rampe, tu sautes...
- Je me romprais le cou comme ça.
- Mais non.
Une petite danse sur cet escalier,
et tu as les 2l3 de ta pension comme moi.
Et tu peux obtenir plus
en poursuivant la ville.
On mérite bien ça.
Cinq ans. Pour un flagrant délit.
Pourquoi une peine aussi lourde ?
Parce que c'est votre tour, M. Browning.
C'est chacun son tour.
Vous courez comme des fous lŕ-dehors.
Un juge pourrait vouloir
observer la situation et vous freiner un peu.
Je ne sais pas, Marvin.
Je regarde votre dossier, et je me dis
qu'on peut pas appeler ça un dossier.
Plutôt une encyclopédie.
Le problčme,
c'est qu'on a monté la salle contre vous.
C'est votre tour, comme elle dit.
Racontez-nous des histoires,
ça pourrait ętre le tour d'un autre.
Des histoires.
Avon Barksdale.
Entendu parler ?
Tout le monde en a entendu parler,
dans les tours.
Je ne le connais pas personnellement.
Alors, Stringer Bell ?
Wee-Bey ? Savino ?
Stinkum ? C.C.O. ? Roc-Roc ?
Qui peux-tu nous donner ?
C'est ça ou la taule.
Trčs bien.
Quoi, trčs bien ?
Trčs bien, je ferai mon temps.
Putain, fiston.
T'as pas vu le flic.
Quand tu es pręt, enfile ça.
- Pointe-toi au dortoir A-7.
- A-7.
Pas plus tard qu'ŕ l'heure du petit déj'.
Il y a qui ici ? Du monde du Westside ?
Surtout des gars de Washington.
Super long trajet.
On a encore atterri sur un boulot de merde.
- C'est pas un boulot de merde.
- Ah bon ?
Je suis ŕ Upper Marlboro, Maryland,
en route pour le Sud.
Regarde, encore une vache.
Sers-toi de ton imagination.
Ce petit enculé,
comme on lui a déjŕ tapé dessus une fois,
il nous voit, tu piges ?
Il se met ŕ chialer comme une pisseuse
parce qu'il sait
qu'on est venus exprčs de Prince George
pour lui botter le cul.
Imagine, on le prend,
on le jette dans un réduit,
on lui dit que Mahone est presque mort
de son coup de poing surprise.
Sans déconner. Ce putain de vieux
est tombé dans le coma d'un coup.
Il est en soins intensifs,
avec Mme Mahone et le préfet ŕ son chevet.
Et nous, on a ordre de lui arracher
le scrotum, de le mettre en bouteille,
et de revenir ŕ Baltimore pour l'exposer
parmi les trophées de bowling
du club de la police.
Et aprčs ça,
ce merdeux s'arręte de chialer
juste assez longtemps
pour nous vendre des collčgues ŕ lui.
Stringer Bell. Avon Barksdale.
- Tu crois ?
- Ouais.
Ce connard donne tout le monde,
et on peut fermer le dossier.
- Cool.
- Pas vrai ?
CENTRE DE RÉÉDUCATION JUVÉNILE
ADMINISTRATION
UNITÉ RÉSIDENTIELLE - CHELTENHAM
Personne n'a moufté
pour les cas de possession ?
Dans ce secteur,
Barksdale a plus d'influence que nous.
C'est comme pour ces putains d'homicides.
Des témoins qui mentent,
qui changent d'avis, qui reçoivent du fric...
- Tu leur en veux ?
- Pas vraiment.
On leur rend parfois une petite visite
dans les cités.
- C'est bien Dee, ton homme ?
- D'Angelo, oui.
Ce cas parle d'un Dee
comme tireur potentiel.
- Avec des preuves.
- Pas possible.
Je vois ça d'ici, moi.
- Diedre Kresson, un des cas de Keeley.
- Allez, Jay, c'est une gamine,
sur qui on a tiré
dans un appartement de Northeast.
Je ne vois pas le lien
avec les tueurs du Westside.
- Ils n'ont pas de bagnoles ?
- Ça colle pas, Jay.
Si, regarde ton rapport.
On l'a vue avec un certain Dee
la nuit oů elle a été butée.
Il y a combien de Dee dans l'ordi ?
Pour les noms de rue ?
Dis-moi un truc, Jimmy.
Tu as combien de cas sur Barksdale ?
- Une douzaine, je pense.
- Une douzaine.
Combien d'entre eux viennent
de notre équipe ?
Un. Gerard Bogue.
Un cas ? Il manque un gars ŕ ton équipe
depuis des semaines.
On va écouter tes appels,
attraper tes cas, te tourner autour
comme une pute de village unijambiste
un jour de paie, et pourquoi ?
Pour que tu aies ta part d'aventure
et que tu résolves tous les dossiers ?
C'est bien ça ?
Il t'a bien eu.
Sois sympa, McNulty.
- Trčs bien.
- Bon garçon, ça.
Pourquoi pas refiler cette merde
ŕ Santangelo ?
Il est pas censé nous aider lŕ-dessus ?
Je le ferais si je savais oů il est.
Il doit avoir autre chose, il est jamais lŕ.
- Qu'est-ce que Daniels en dit ?
- Rien, je le couvre.
Il était de sortie hier toute la journée,
et aussi avant-hier.
Keeley a vraiment fait n'importe quoi
sur ce dossier.
Tout ce que j'ai, c'est un 24,
des photos du crime, et ça.
"Tywanda a appelé.
Pas de nom, pas d'adresse.
"Votre victime aurait été tuée
aprčs la visite d'un certain Dee."
Pas de description.
Juste un numéro de téléphone.
Appelle.
Le numéro que vous avez demandé
n'est plus en service.
Plus en service.
"ll t'a bien eu, Jimmy."
T'as raison, enfoiré, il m'a bien eu aussi.
Je vais appeler les Télécoms,
voir s'ils ont des mises ŕ jour.
T'es content, enfoiré ?
Tu es sűr de cette identification, Bubs ?
Je vois la camionnette.
Elle se dirige vers Lexington.
Les plaques ont été volées
sur une voiture garée ici męme.
Tu crois qu'ils sont du coin ?
Ça se peut.
Les rumeurs dans les tours
accusent Omar et sa bande.
- Omar ? C'est qui ?
- Tu connais pas Omar ?
Omar, la terreur.
Ça fait des années qu'il fait des arnaques.
- Il est dur ?
- Ce renoi n'est pas dans les gangs.
- Il a un nom ?
- Juste Omar.
Pas de nom de famille.
C'est qui, sa famille ?
Tu te remets No-Heart Anthony ?
lls ont grandi ensemble, des frangins.
No-Heart Anthony ?
Miss Kima,
ne me dis pas que tu ne t'en souviens pas.
Putain, tu bosses dans quelle ville
depuis toutes ces années ?
J'ai honte d'ętre ton indic, lŕ.
- Merde.
- Quoi ?
- Je suis en retard pour mes cours.
- Cours ?
- 1 2-14.
- 12-14 ?
Y a-t-il quelqu'un de dispo
dans mon unité sur le canal 13 ?
35, je prends.
La came bouge.
La poudre d'Avon est toujours de 1er choix.
C'était un bon coup ?
Pas mal.
La tactique laissait un peu ŕ désirer.
Je sais, j'ai pas assuré,
d'avoir lâché ton nom.
J'en ai rien ŕ battre de ça.
Tout le monde connaît Omar ici,
tu m'entends ?
Mais je veux pas
qu'ils te prennent, baby boy.
Shirley vient nous faire son plan.
- C'est tous les jours la męme merde.
- M. Omar.
J'ai pas reçu mes allocs.
Yo, Mike. Donne-lui de la poudre.
Et maintenant ?
J'ai des flingues.
On va aller s'amuser un peu dans l'Eastside,
Ie temps que ça se calme.
Ça va marcher.
- Tu veux pas rester la nuit ici ?
- Non.
- Sűr ?
- Je vais voir ma mčre.
- T'éloigne pas.
- Compris.
C'est qui le meilleur ?
J'ai un truc ŕ faire d'abord,
aprčs je le lâcherai en ville.
Merci d'avoir répondu si vite.
- Bubbs.
- McNulty.
Quoi de neuf ?
Tu connais No-Heart Anthony ?
Anthony Little ?
1058 Argyle, appartement 16-J.
Il est ŕ Hagerstown
pour cambriolage, pourquoi ?
Mon homme.
Allez vous faire foutre.
Tu sais ce que font les enculés
quand ils tuent une biche ?
Quand ils vont tuer des bestioles ?
Ils les attachent sur le pare-chocs,
pour que tout le monde
puisse admirer le boulot.
Vous me suivez ?
C'est ça que je veux. Sérieux.
Je veux que tout le monde voie cet enculé.
Je vais envoyer un message
ŕ la cité sur cet enculé,
qu'ils sachent qu'on plaisante pas.
On a des mecs sur lui.
Tu leur dis que j'en offre 1 000 $
et 2 000 sur Omar.
- Bird est sur lui.
- Savino aussi.
Tu sais que Bird a fait de la taule
avec Omar ?
Il dit que c'est qu'une tapette.
Une tapette ? On sort d'ici.
Il paraît qu'il a tout un harem de garçons
ŕ Jessup.
Cet enculé a encore moins besoin
de chattes, maintenant qu'il est sorti.
Alors comme ça,
il est branché suceur de queues ?
On double la pression
sur Sweet Lips, d'accord ?
On met 4 000 $ sur lui.
6 000 $ si je peux lui parler
avant que tu lui rčgles son compte.
- N'en dis pas plus.
- On s'en charge.
Stickup a été tué ŕ la planque une nuit.
- Il y aura une rafle de police.
- Du neuf dans la cour ?
Peut-ętre, oui.
- Et mon neveu ?
- Je sais pas, il se débrouille bien.
Il se fait du fric ŕ la cité,
il ne sait pas encore qu'il a un problčme.
Je suis sur lui.
Yo, tu m'emmčnes dans le pays
de La petite maison dans la prairie ?
Je suis en retard.
Je te lâche aprčs, en rentrant en ville.
- En retard pour quoi ?
- Foot.
Foutre ?
Mets-lui un but !
Déployez-vous.
Premičre équipe, sur le terrain !
- Papa !
- Mikey, ça va ?
- Qui gagne ?
- C'est eux, 4 ŕ 1 .
4 ŕ 1 ? C'est qui, votre gardien de but ?
- Ricardo. Je l'aide.
- C'est bien.
Il faut boire pendant les pauses.
Je ne veux pas que tu te déshydrates.
- Salut.
- Salut.
Voici Bubbles.
- Bonjour.
- Deuxičme équipe, ŕ vous !
- Allez, Mike, chope-les !
- Au revoir, papa.
Tu es en retard. Il a cru
que tu viendrais pas, une fois de plus.
C'est ce boulot, tu sais bien.
Je ne peux pas ętre lŕ pour le bus de 16 h.
Je dois les voir plus d'un week-end
sur deux. Ils ont besoin de moi.
Je ne te les confierai pas plus souvent.
Mon avocat me dit que c'est 50-50...
C'est pas 50-50
si je ne peux pas le voir de la semaine.
- Tu les vois chaque jour...
- Ne t'énerve pas. Mon avocat...
Qu'il aille se faire foutre.
Va te faire foutre toi-męme.
- Tu as vu ?
- Oui, j'ai vu.
Allez, vas-y.
Ça va, ici ?
Il n'y a qu'un pas d'ici au paradis.
Comment il connaissait la planque ?
Les Stups la connaissent pas.
Un sale renoi la leur a donnée.
Mec, pas besoin d'un indic
pour qu'Omar et ses mecs
viennent fouiner
pour voir oů est la planque.
- Putain, Bodie. Ils l'ont massacré.
- Ils lui ont cassé le cul.
- Putain, Bodie. Ils l'ont massacré.
- Ils lui ont cassé le cul.
Il est pas en taule pour avoir tué un Stup ?
Comment t'es sorti aussi vite ?
- Qu'est-ce que t'as piqué ?
- Une Camry XLE.
On fait un tour ? Elle est garée au coin.
C'est minable, le centre de rééducation.
C'est pas assez bon pour moi,
c'est que des conneries pour petits garçons.
Ils peuvent pas me garder.
Pourquoi tu te moques ?
C'est si drôle que ça ?
Si c'était toi, ton cul y serait encore.
T'as déjŕ vu une prison, mec ?
T'as déjŕ buté un mec ?
C'est moi qui viens de rentrer, tu piges ?
Huit mois ŕ Eager Street,
et un meurtre ŕ mon compte.
- C'est vrai, t'en as un.
- Tu n'en connais qu'un.
Faut vous informer, bande d'enculés.
Tu sais, prčs du comté,
en haut de l'Eastside ?
Ils ont ces apparts, tu vois ?
Y'avait une poule lŕ-bas.
Elle était, disons...
J'en ai plus revu des comme ça.
Shorty avait raison, j'avoue.
Tu l'as baisée ?
Ça s'est pas passé comme ça.
Mon oncle s'en occupait.
Ça faisait un bail, eux deux,
puis elle a découvert
qu'il en avait une autre dans le coin.
En fait, il en avait quelques-unes
dans le coin,
vous pigez ?
Elle a pété un plomb
et a menacé de raconter aux flics
ce qu'elle était pas censée savoir.
- Et merde.
- Ouais, tu vois.
Mais moi, je sais ętre discret,
et mon oncle le savait.
Ils m'ont amené prčs de sa crčche.
M'ont dit qu'elle était au rez-de-chaussée,
1er niveau.
J'ai fait le tour par la fenętre de derričre.
J'avais mon .45.
J'ai regardé ŕ l'intérieur,
c'était sombre comme tout,
vu qu'il était 3 h du mat,
qu'on y voyait que dalle.
Qu'est-ce que tu as fait ?
J'ai sorti mon flingue,
j'ai tapé sur la fenętre avec.
Le bruit l'a réveillée.
Elle est arrivée, comme prévu.
Elle était ŕ poil.
Et elle avait une robe de chambre ŕ la main,
et pendant qu'elle l'enfilait, elle a allumé.
Du coup, on y voyait clair ŕ l'intérieur,
mais elle y voyait que dalle dehors.
Elle était ŕ poil.
Elle a entendu le raffut ŕ la fenętre,
elle a pas eu le choix,
alors elle s'est pointée
pour voir ce que c'était.
Elle a avancé,
a regardé dehors
pour voir d'oů ça venait.
Et aprčs ?
Il l'a butée.
Dee, pourquoi tu l'as pas baisée avant ?
- Mec, t'es malade, ferme-la.
- Quoi ? Je dis que...
Il y a vraiment quelque chose de pourri.
C'est ridicule.
Tout ça parce qu'un congélateur
du labo a un court-circuit,
Ies échantillons de sang de 56 homicides
et 15 viols ont pourri sur place.
- Le procureur est au courant ?
- Et le maire.
Nos échantillons ont plus de 25 ans,
pour la plupart.
Tu trouves des fonds ailleurs,
ŕ but non lucratif ?
Par exemple ?
La Fondation Abell, par exemple.
Mon frčre fait partie de la direction.
Je peux leur en toucher un mot...
- Tu pourrais m'arranger le coup ?
- Qui ne risque rien...
C'est certain, Votre Honneur.
Dans cet esprit de collaboration,
oů en sommes-nous
sur l'affaire Barksdale ?
C'est aussi pour ça que je suis passé.
Flagrants délits de vente
et possession de drogue, je savais déjŕ.
On a arręté des intermédiaires,
comme vous le voyez.
Au moins, le message est clair,
męme si le groupe n'est pas dissous.
Ce truc ne mentionne ni Barksdale,
ni Bell, ni les meurtres.
Les preuves pointent dans cette direction.
Non.
On a encore du pain sur la planche,
n'est-ce pas ?
Police, ouvrez !
- Quoi ?
- Ouvrez cette putain de porte !
- Rien en haut devant.
- Rien dans la cuisine.
Je suis ŕ la porte de derričre.
- Personne n'est sorti ?
- Tout est tranquille.
Rien ŕ l'étage.
Je vais cogner cet enculé
comme putain de bâtard
pour s'ętre planqué dans ce trou ŕ rats.
Ça grouille de vermine ici.
Dis ŕ Bodie qu'il nous a au cul.
Désolé d'avoir été grossier.
Je ne savais pas qu'il n'y avait que vous ici.
C'est encore les drogues ?
Vous voulez vous asseoir ?
Preston est venu chez moi
quand ma fille est morte.
Il avait quatre ans.
Mais je savais qu'il était déjŕ en colčre.
Sa mčre vivait lŕ-bas, camée jusqu'aux yeux.
Elle n'écoutait plus personne.
Non, mec, c'était pas nous.
2 h 30 dans les tours ?
Man, vous ętes cinglés.
Je sais pas de quoi tu parles.
Vous pensez pouvoir faire mieux ?
Je suis désolé, madame.
Et excusez-nous d'avoir déboulé
comme ça chez vous.
Si Preston passe par ici,
donnez-lui ceci
et dites-lui qu'on veut lui parler, d'accord ?
Désolé.
Tu foutais quoi lŕ-dedans ?
Je causais.
- Tu causais ?
- Ouais.
- Ŕ plus.
- Ça marche.
Je conduis.
Oui ?
McNulty.
Un juge pour toi.
Oui ?
Je peux vous rappeler ?
- Monsieur ?
- Oui.
J'ai réfléchi.
Je sais que c'est une violation
du rčglement, mais...
Hier soir, j'étais ŕ la maison,
ŕ poil sur le canapé.
Une main autour d'une bičre bien fraîche,
et l'autre autour de ma magnifique,
mais encore molle,
merveille de 1 1,5 cm
et j'essayais de toutes mes forces
de me rappeler des tétons de Leila Kaufman
quand son maillot avait glissé,
le soir de cette fęte ŕ Hillendale.
- Leila Kaufman ?
- Oui, monsieur.
Été 72.
J'ai donc cette nana super canon en vue,
si je puis dire,
et je suis dangereusement
proche de l'engorgement,
quand d'un seul coup, surgi de nulle part,
cet enfoiré d'inspecteur McNulty
fait irruption dans ma cervelle.
McNulty ?
Et lŕ, j'ouvre les yeux,
et suis forcé d'admettre
que ma nuit était foutue.
Et j'avais rien d'autre ŕ faire,
qu'ŕ penser ŕ McNulty.
Parce qu'il est clair que ce gars
et ses putains de problčmes
me foutent la vie en l'air.
C'est clair.
Mais ce n'est pas la faute de Jimmy.
- Non ?
- Non.
Jimmy est accro, monsieur.
Accro ŕ quoi ?
Ŕ lui-męme.
Ce n'est pas drôle, monsieur.
En fait, c'est une putain de tragédie.
Ce mec est arrivé au point
oů il croit qu'il est toujours
le plus fort d'entre tous.
Et vous savez quoi ?
C'est pas sa faute, parce qu'il faut admettre,
il ne fait pas partie d'un club de surdoués,
il n'a qu'un job dans la police de Baltimore.
Les deux premičres années ŕ la Crim,
dans l'équipe d'Ulmansky,
avec Tony Lamartino comme coéquipier.
Et pendant des mois,
c'était vraiment lui le plus intelligent.
Oů veux-tu en venir, Jay ?
En fait,
il ne peut pas s'en empęcher.
C'est vraiment un trou du cul,
mais c'est un bon flic.
Il a résolu huit affaires l'an dernier.
Dont celle d'un cadavre flottant
en décomposition,
non identifié pendant trois semaines.
Dis ŕ ton protégé
qu'il me torche ce dossier en quinze jours.
Et il pourra rentrer avec un dossier propre.
Tu aurais adoré.
Burrell était assis en face de moi
avec quelques arrestations de rue,
ŕ prétendre qu'il avait un plan.
Qu'est-ce que tu lui as dit ?
"On n'apprend pas ŕ une guenon
ŕ faire des grimaces", je lui ai dit.
- J'ai bien fait, pas vrai ?
- Faut que j'y aille.
"Commentez le décret Hicks
en tant que manifestation
"d'une tentative judiciaire
de maintenir la prompte disposition
"des dossiers criminels
au sein d'un systčme de tribunal moderne."
Quoi ?
C'est exactement ce que j'ai dit.
"Quoi ?"
C'est quoi, le décret Hicks ?
Tu as mis du fluo sur mon canapé ?
Quoi ? Non.
Si.
Ça y était avant.
Tu parles. Putain, ça part pas, le marqueur.
- C'est pas moi, je le jure.
- Montre-moi ce marqueur.
Si tu le veux,
il te faut un mandat de perquisition.
Sérieux, il me faut un motif valable.
Je vais te botter le cul.
Ça te va, comme motif valable ?
- Donne-moi ce marqueur.
- Voilŕ comment on monte en violence.
Tu sais que tu as violé mes droits civils ?
Nouvelle loi : pas de marqueur sur le sofa.
Tu vas faire tes devoirs sur la table, lŕ-bas.
Allez, bouge.
Donne-moi mon marqueur.
Je vais devoir me servir de soude.
Purée, le salaire du mois va ętre englouti
par cette facture de téléphone.
Non, c'est pour le boulot,
c'est eux qui paient.
Phelan ne lâchera pas.
On avance, pour Barksdale ?
- Non, monsieur.
- Qu'avez-vous ŕ me dire ?
Rien du tout, monsieur,
j'attends que vous me parliez.
Je ferai tout ce que vous me direz de faire.
Je peux vous foutre la pression,
si vous voulez.
Si vous préférez lâcher...
Si vous voulez en mettre un autre
sur le coup, il s'y prendrait différemment.
Vous cherchez ŕ vous défiler, lieutenant ?
Déjŕ ?
McNulty pense
ŕ une surveillance électronique.
Vous en pensez quoi ?
On n'y arrive pas comme ça.
Monte ton cul lŕ-haut.
Non, mec. Ça va marcher.
Je grimpe ŕ aucune échelle.
Tu ne l'auras jamais.
Je l'ai eu.
- Au logement on doit croire qu'on est cons.
- C'est...
- C'est ton pager ou le mien ?
- Le mien.
- Hé, fais gaffe ŕ ma tęte.
- Ça a ricoché sur cette putain de caméra.
Faut apprendre ŕ viser.
Yo, c'est qui ?
Qu'en penses-tu ?
Autorisation 3 ?
Pas pour une mise sur écoute.
Pour cloner un pager, je l'ai eu de Pearlman.
- Des pagers ?
- Un truc démodé.
- Pourquoi pas des portables ?
- Personne n'a plus de pagers.
Hier soir, j'ai vérifié une facture détaillée.
Tous les appels entrants sont listés.
Donc, si on chope le pager de Barksdale,
on touche les grosses pointures.
On va peut-ętre remonter au fournisseur.
Qui est No-Heart Anthony ?
Il deale depuis le début des années 90.
Y a un ou deux ans, je sais pas pourquoi,
il s'est retrouvé ŕ Randallstown,
ŕ se faire une bijouterie.
Il s'est planté et a eu la moitié
des flics du comté au cul.
Et je suppose qu'il ne se sentait pas pręt
ŕ faire son temps,
alors il a pointé un .44 sur sa poitrine,
a tiré sur la gâchette.
Un .44 ?
Blessure par balle avec contact.
Il s'est réveillé deux heures plus tard
aux urgences.
- Avec un nouveau surnom.
- Voilŕ.
Selon Bubbles,
Ie frčre d'Anthony a pillé la planque
de Barksdale, l'autre jour.
Un mec du nom d'Omar.
C'est pas ce qu'il y a de plus facile,
de piller des dealers.
Il a sűrement un flingue sur lui.
Si on l'arręte,
il pourrait avoir envie de causer.
Et s'il sait oů est la planque de Barksdale,
il en sait sűrement long.
Tu vois ? Encore un plan.
Faut juste qu'on se montre convaincants.
Tu veux en causer ŕ Daniels ?
Il t'écoutera plus que moi.
Oů est Santangelo ?
Au service des Preuves. Il a une affaire, lŕ.
Je n'ai encore rien entendu contre,
donc, on continue.
Des idées ?
On continue les rafles.
Mais on reste au niveau de la rue.
D'un autre côté, les derniers mecs chopés
avaient des pagers.
Comme D'Angelo Barksdale
quand McNulty l'a chopé.
On pourrait se faire quelques pagers
pour voir oů ça mčne.
- Se faire quoi ?
- Leurs pagers.
On les bipe, on nous bipe.
On voit qui c'est, leur numéro.
S'ils sont si pros,
pourquoi se servir de pagers ?
Pourquoi ne pas investir
dans des portables ?
Ils en connaissent un rayon.
On met pas un pager sur écoute.
On peut pas passer
de coups de fil, non plus.
Pas besoin de la liste de tous les appels
des téléphones publics des cités
et de tous les téléphones
qui appellent les pagers.
Comment s'y prendre pour les pagers ?
Une autorisation de mise sur écoute.
On a assez de motifs valables avec les flags
et la surveillance.
On a presque tout épuisé.
Ça m'épuise rien que d'y penser.
Bien. Il faut avoir épuisé
les autres méthodes pour l'autorisation.
On peut prouver que rien n'a marché.
Les rafles, les arrestations,
personne n'a vendu personne.
On n'a pas un indic
qui nous fasse décoller de la rue.
On a tout épuisé.
Il ne nous reste qu'ŕ suivre les suspects,
et prouver que ce n'est pas possible.
On montre au juge qu'on ne peut pas
résoudre l'affaire comme ça, ce qui est vrai.
C'est pas possible dans ces tours.
Il faut montrer qu'on a essayé.
On a un numéro de pager ?
C'était écrit sur le mur de la planque,
avec un "D" ŕ côté.
C'est D'Angelo ? T'as vérifié ?
C'est bien lui.
On y va.
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ? Je comprends rien.
Je te l'explique si tu me paies un café.
Tu m'expliques encore pourquoi
je me tape une reconstitution vieille
de 6 mois ?
Regarde ce dossier minuscule.
Keeley n'a rien foutu.
Sauf la reconstitution.
C'est de Keeley dont on parle.
Enfoiré de Jay
avec sa logique ŕ deux balles.
Ça ne ressemble ŕ rien de ce qu'on fait.
On peut toujours tenter.
- Ça fera un sergent heureux.
- Pourquoi pas ?
Tu connais Lester Freamon ?
Un peu, pourquoi ?
Il est avec nous sur l'affaire Barksdale.
T'avais pas que des branleurs ?
Il a tout l'air d'un branleur,
assis lŕ ŕ jouer avec ses jouets.
Il se fait plus de fric avec cette merde
que t'en as jamais eu en bossant.
- Laisse pas Lester te rouler.
- C'est déjŕ fait.
Il nous a montré un truc ŕ la réunion.
C'est un flic-né.
Il était ŕ la Crim.
- Pourquoi il est parti ?
- Demande-le-lui.
- C'est ici ?
- Oui, ça n'a pas été loué depuis.
Bordel.
Enculé.
Putain d'enculé.
Qu'est-ce que...
- Non.
- Enculé.
Salauds.
Putain de bordel.
Putain d'enculé de merde.
Putain d'enculé.
Bordel de merde.
Mate-moi ça.
Putain d'enculé.
Bordel.
Sydnor est ŕ pied, Carv est en voiture,
Herc, tu vas sur le toit derričre Amity.
Encore pour moi, le boulot de merde ?
On reste sur D'Angelo.
Si on le perd, on le perd, d'accord ?
On va le perdre.
On suit personne dans ces tours.
On traîne pas dans la zone pavillonaire
sans raison.
Soyons clairs, on veut le perdre,
c'est bien ça ?
Il faut le perdre ?
Oui.
Pourquoi faire ça, alors ?
Allez. Fais-moi confiance sur ce coup.
Tu es de la police aprčs tout.
Tu sais ce que tu fais, mais tu le fais pas.
Tu es pręteur sur gage depuis quand ?
Treize ans et quatre mois.
- Treize ans ?
- Et quatre mois.
Je peux te demander
ce qu'un flic peut bien faire ici ?
Des rapports
sur les pręts sur gages officiels
d'un montant supérieur ŕ 50 $.
Des cartes pour chaque article.
Qu'il faut classer ensuite.
Si on veut vérifier
si un article volé n'a pas été mis en gage,
on vérifie si on a une carte.
Si on en a une, c'est oui. Sinon, non.
- Pendant treize ans ?
- Et quatre mois.
Pourquoi t'as quitté la Crim ?
J'ai pas demandé.
Tu as été viré ?
Qu'est-ce que t'as fait ?
Mon boulot.
Je crois que t'as besoin d'un verre.
Juste un ?
J'ai eu cette affaire, ŕ Brooklyn, l'été 87.
Une femme de 80 ans, poignardée,
en chemise de nuit, au lit,
fenętre de derričre fracturée.
J'étais dessus quinze jours.
J'ai chopé les noms
de deux voleurs de Curtis Bay.
Le premier a craché,
et tenté de charger le deuxičme.
Il y avait des preuves ?
Une empreinte pour le numéro deux,
une autre pour le premier sur sa pharmacie.
Donc, c'était tout bon, non ?
Surtout que numéro un
est passé prčs de la maison
oů les trucs de la vieille
ont été vendus : radio-réveil, télé, toasteur.
C'est quoi le problčme ?
Le receleur.
C'était le fils d'un grand rédacteur
de News America.
Le mec publie ce journal,
et son fils est camé,
fait le con et se défonce ŕ Locust Point.
Le préfet adjoint,
qui est d'humeur ŕ rendre service,
en touche un mot au major,
qui me dit de résoudre l'affaire
sans toucher au receleur.
Juste les empreintes et les déclarations.
Et il a fait ça pourquoi ?
Pour se mettre un rédacteur en poche ?
J'imagine.
C'était Burrell ?
Non, Mueller.
Préfet adjoint aux opérations avant Burrell.
Qu'est-ce que tu as fait ?
Ŕ ton avis ?
Je l'ai poursuivi pour corruption,
et il a dű comparaître.
T'aurais pu résoudre le dossier sans lui.
Avec les autres preuves.
Probablement.
Pourquoi tu ne l'as pas fait ?
Pourquoi ?
Pourquoi tu te casses le cul
ŕ poursuivre Barksdale ?
Une semaine aprčs le procčs,
le major est venu me voir,
m'a demandé ce que je voulais faire.
J'ai répondu que je m'en tapais,
que j'aimais ętre ŕ l'extérieur.
Qu'on me file du boulot
oů je gagne ma vie, tu sais,
qu'on m'envoie sur l'avenue Edmondson,
rien ŕ battre.
Et alors ? T'es resté dehors ?
Le major est revenu,
m'a demandé oů je ne voulais pas aller.
Comme s'il voulait s'assurer
que tout irait bien pour moi.
Je lui ai dit
que je supportais pas les paperasses.
Les bureaux.
Que je voulais qu'il m'envoie dehors.
Pręteur sur gage.
Ils m'ont bien eu.
Pourquoi ils t'ont laissé sortir de lŕ ?
Ils m'avaient oublié.
Merde, Lester.
Tu es ressuscité ?
Tu es sorti de ton caveau ?
Bunk Moreland dit que tu es un flic
par vocation. Un des rares.
J'ai eu mes heures de gloire.
Inspecteur,
quand ils te demanderont oů tu veux aller,
ce qu'ils feront,
rends-toi service,
ferme ta gueule.
Je vais pisser un coup.
- C'est pour moi.
- D'accord.
Salut.
- Kima est lŕ ?
- Vous ętes ?
Dites-lui que c'est McNulty.
C'est pour toi, un Blanc ŕ l'air paumé.
Seigneur.
Ça s'est passé comment aujourd'hui ?
Perdu dans le 221 .
On l'a retrouvé dans la zone pavillonaire,
puis reperdu dans la rue Schroeder.
Bien joué.
- Tu peux conduire ?
- Oui.
Je voulais te remercier.
De quoi ?
Pour aujourd'hui, tu sais, avec Daniels.
- Remercie plutôt Lester.
- Je l'ai fait.
Mais je voulais te remercier,
inspecteur Greggs.
Pas de lézard. Bonne nuit.
C'est une bonne nuit.
J'ai loupé quelque chose ?
Pas grand-chose.
Un amoureux ?
Encore pire. Il est seul.
T'es pas allée en cours aujourd'hui encore.
Tu as dit que tu t'y collais.
J'essaie.
C'est chaud au boulot.
Je fais du mieux possible.
Tu as dit que tu avais besoin
de faire autre chose.
Qui serait mieux pour nous.
Tu as promis.
Man.
Qu'est-ce que je vais faire de toi ?
Tu sais, d'autres femmes
se sont laissées séduire.
Qu'est-ce que tu portes lŕ-dessous ?
... votre émission préférée.
Si vous voulez participer
à un jeu qui en arrache .:
un jeu d'enfer, appelez-nous...
Allô ?
Allô ?
C'était qui ?
- Ils ont raccroché sans rien dire.
- Ah oui ?
Et après ?
Tu n'appelles jamais d'ici de toute façon.
JAMESTOWNE - PAVILLON TÉMOIN
Ça gaze, mon pote ?
Fais en sorte
qu'on ne puisse plus appeler de là.
De l'appart ? Pourquoi ?
Qu'est-ce que Chantay va dire
si elle ne peut plus appeler de chez elle ?
Bon. J'ai compris.
Ça te pose un problème ?
- Je préfère.
- C'est pas ça,
mais on fait déjà super gaffe
de ce côté-là.
Ça me paraît un peu trop fort.
Ça tourne un peu à la paranoïa.
Non, pas ce téléphone-là.
Je m'en suis servi hier.
Pourquoi tu réagis comme ça ?
Comme si...
Comme si j'avais pas d'ennemis
qui voulaient me faire la peau.
Mais non.
C'est bon.

"... t'es trop lent, tu réagis trop tard."
-- Avon Barksdale
Bon, ça va se faire en douceur,
ces crétins du Eastside,
rien à voir avec les gars d'Avon.
Regardez, vous allez comprendre.
Bon, vous serez tous là, d'accord ?
Attends.
Hé, Boo !
Moi, je vais arriver par là.
Bailey, tu feras le guet dans l'allée.
Hé !
Hé, Maurice est un peu limite.
- De combien ?
- De trois.
Dis-lui de pousser ses limites.
Et toi, tu seras où ?
Le piège se refermera sur eux juste là.
T'es sûr qu'ils vont se barrer
en passant par l'allée ?
Les rats cherchent toujours à se réfugier
face au danger.
Et c'est toi, hein ?
- Qui ça ?
- Le danger.
Non, je suis un renoi qui a un plan,
c'est tout.
Et un flingue.
Pour de vrai.
Désolé pour le retard.
Je me suis perdu en allant dans l'autre sens.
- Ça mène à une zone de chargement.
- Oui, et d'entreposage à long terme.
Alors, ils vous ont planqués là ?
C'est assez parlant.
- Oui, et le message est...
- Loin des yeux, loin du coeur.
Parole de troglodyte.
Beaucoup de paperasse pour rien.
Les fondations
de votre enquête, inspecteur.
Si elles sont solides, ça peut mener loin.
En cas contraire, tout s'effondre.
On est prêts ?
Jurez-vous que cette déclaration
sous serment est vraie
et exacte à votre connaissance ?
- Oui.
- Oui.
Par les pouvoirs qui me sont conférés,
je vous déclare mariés.
- Il a déjà prêté serment ?
- Le procureur ?
Oui.
Je vois.
Une copie est sous scellés pour le tribunal,
la police a les autres.
Comment ça marche ?
Même fréquence
que celui de D'Angelo Barksdale.
Il a un pager, nous aussi.
- Alors c'est à nous ?
- C'est officiel.
- C'est à vous.
- C'est parti.
Les stars sont toujours plus petites
en vrai qu'à l'écran.
Hé !
Hé !
Mate un peu, il arrive.
- Y a embrouille.
- Fais gaffe, il a un flingue.
- Il a un flingue.
- Il arrive.
Allez, Omar se pointe, mec !
Oh, merde !
Eh oui,
c'est moi qui fais la loi.
- Qu'est-ce que t'en sais ?
- Si c'était vrai, je l'aurais chopé.
Hé, il dit qu'on peut pas choper le sida
juste en se faisant tailler une pipe.
Pauvre naze, tu le chopes
si t'es dans un minou, tu piges ?
Mets une capote si tu veux,
mais elles aiment pas sucer si t'en as une.
Qu'est-ce que t'en sais ?
Qui t'essaies de baiser au fait ?
Arletta Mouzone. La cousine de Treenee.
Putain, mec, dans ce cas-là,
mets-en une énorme.
Style, sac poubelle. L'angoisse.
Je me taperais pas cette salope
avec la bite de D'Angelo...
Trop dégueu.
Je comprends pourquoi les renois
viennent ici nous voler !
Hé, tu sais quoi, toi ?
Quoi ?
Laisse tomber.
Appel reçu :
Le chiffre 142 ne correspond à rien.
Six appels interceptés jusque-là
dont cinq qui ne mènent à rien ?
C'est notre système qui déconne ?
Ce qu'on reçoit est normal,
un numéro à sept chiffres
plus deux autres pour identifier
celui qui appelle, ici, c'est 13.
McNulty, sur la une.
- Ouais.
- Tu as reçu un appel commençant par 142 ?
Ouais, on l'a aussi sous les yeux.
- C'est vraiment bizarre.
- Ouais, à plus.
Le même numéro apparaît
sur sa copie de pager.
Donc c'est pas notre système.
Ces petits cons utilisent un code
pour se couvrir ?
- Plutôt sophistiqué.
- Quoi ?
Ils ont codé les numéros
qui apparaissent sur leur pager.
Comment tu le sais ?
À chaque fois que Barksdale
reçoit un message,
nous aussi, avec l'heure d'envoi.
McNulty a une copie,
mais c'est ça qui nous sert de preuve.
Idem pour les enregistrements.
Chaque fois qu'un téléphone public
est utilisé dans la cité,
ça nous donne le numéro,
l'heure et la durée de l'appel.
Les appels extérieurs aussi.
Du matériel de pro. Super cool.
Tu dis qu'ils utilisent un code ?
C'est obligé. Ces numéros n'ont aucun sens.
- Tu as appelé ?
- C'est le van de Omar.
Bubbles l'a repéré.
Plaques différentes, pas de plainte pour vol,
les plaques sont bonnes,
mais Bubs l'a reconnu
aux galeries sur le toit.
Bien joué. Tu le cueilles ?
Je peux toujours essayer.
On a vu Omar qui portait un flingue,
on pourrait l'avoir avec ça.
Le pager a donné quelque chose ?
Huit appels jusqu'à présent,
quasiment tous plus ou moins codés.
C'est pas des appels sur Baltimore,
c'est sûr.
Trois semaines pour que Daniels accepte,
une semaine pour les attestations
et maintenant, cette merde.
Ça peut pas être bien compliqué
si ces débiles s'en servent, non ?
Si on peut pas les décoder,
qu'est-ce que ça fait de nous ?
Ramène Bubs au poste, je t'attends ici.
Ça marche.
- Qu'est-ce que j'ai loupé, ma belle ?
- Rien d'intéressant.
C'est chiant, hein ?
Comment tu peux faire ça
sans avoir envie de te défoncer ?
C'est ce que je me demande.
C'est un peu la folie en ce moment, non ?
String, je peux pas te mentir.
Ceux qui nous ont braqués,
on n'a rien vu venir.
Les grosses frappes,
putain, je sais pas d'où ils sortent.
Les keufs. Ils se pointent !
- Les keufs arrivent, les gars.
- On se casse.
- Bon, qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
- Quoi ?
Faut que tu fasses comprendre à tes gars
que c'est les braqueurs et les escrocs
qui nous emmerdent le plus.
S'ils commencent à faire ça,
t'es de la baise, tu saisis ?
Tu sais, ton oncle et moi,
on pense que t'as une balance
dans tes rangs.
- Quoi ?
- Y en a un qui renseigne les braqueurs.
Faut que tu t'en occupes, tu me suis ?
Tu peux pas laisser passer ça.
Voilà ce que tu vas faire.
On est quel jour, vendredi ?
C'est quoi, le vendredi ?
- Le jour de paie.
- Pas celui-ci.
Pourquoi ?
Tu vas les appeler,
comme si tu allais les payer,
et tu leur tombes dessus.
Tu leur dis que t'es pas content,
qu'ils bossent pas comme il faut.
Et que tant que t'es pas content,
tu les paieras pas. Compris ?
Mais String, si tu paies pas un renoi,
il va arrêter de bosser pour toi.
Tu crois quoi ? Qu'ils vont trouver un job ?
Tu crois qu'ils vont te dire : "Va chier,
"oublie-moi, je reprends mes études" ?
Non, ils vont faire un peu la gueule,
mais ils vont pas se barrer.
- Et ils te respecteront encore plus.
- Ouais.
Quand ils seront à sec,
ils viendront te supplier
Quand ils seront à sec,
ils viendront te supplier
de leur donner une petite avance,
quand ils auront vraiment plus une thune.
Ceux-là, tu les raies de ta liste.
Mais ceux qui te restent fidèles,
qui continuent à bosser
sans te demander quoi que ce soit,
c'est d'eux que je veux entendre
parler. Compris ?
Tu sais comment pourrir
la vie d'un renoi, String.
- Commence par t'occuper de celui-là.
- T'es ma préférée.
Merde, laisse-moi m'occuper de ça.
- Hé, Poot.
- Ouais, je...
- Viens par là.
- Quoi ?
C'est quoi, ce bordel ? C'est quoi, putain ?
Tu connais les règles.
- Putain, mais qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
- Des photocopies.
D'un téléphone.
Putain, ça me dépasse.
Il est 15 h passées.
Ils sont où ?
Ils sortent peut-être que la nuit.
J'ai eu un gars du style de Omar
qui bossait pour moi.
Il s'appelait Reuben Terry.
Il était bon ?
Il s'y connaissait comme personne.
Rien de tel qu'un bon indic.
Sortie de l'école.
Tu me prêtes ton portable ?
Oui, c'est bon. Je l'ai fait.
Je sais.
Je sais pas...
- Comment ça, tu sais pas ?
- Comment te faire confiance...
Bon sang, Elena, je suis leur père.
Je les ferais dormir par terre, tu crois ?
Oui, j'ai tout ça.
Draps, oreillers, couvertures
et taies d'oreiller.
Putain, je te dis que oui.
De quelle couleur ?
Quoi ? Mais qu'est-ce que
ça peut te foutre ? Allô ?
- La ligne a été coupée.
- Ça doit être ça.
Tu sais quoi ?
La façon dont mon ex se comporte parfois,
sa façon de gérer les choses...
Un homme moins instruit que moi,
du genre grossier personnage,
moins sensible aux qualités, aux charmes
et à la valeur qu'ont les femmes,
pas moi, mais un mec du genre,
il pourrait la traiter de vraie salope.
Tu viens de traiter
la mère de tes gamins de salope.
Non, c'est faux.
- Je te dis que si.
- Mais non !
On s'arrête là, d'accord ?
J'ai des trucs à faire.
Les keufs déboulent.
Attention, mec, barre-toi !
Merde.
Tu te défends pas trop ce coup-ci.
Tu fatigues, connard ?
Toujours pas remis des coups
que t'a donnés Kima.
Elle t'a pas loupé la dernière fois, hein ?
C'est bien son genre,
elle frappe aussi fort qu'un homme.
Debout.
Tu veux pas récupérer ta carte de visite ?
Allez.
De la baie de Bantry aux murs de Derry
Et de Galway à la ville de Dublin
Eh bien, je n'aijamais vu
Colleen, ma brune
Quej'ai rencontrée dans le comté de Down
Il y a un homme dans le comté de Down
Il y a un homme dans le comté de Down
J'y vais d'abord, je joue le gentil.
- Tu entres, et tu fais le méchant.
- Je vais pas faire semblant.
Les menottes te font mal ?
T'es un vrai champion, hein ?
D'abord, tu envoies un flic à l'hôpital,
ton coup a même failli lui être fatal.
Là, tu te fais la malle
du centre de rééducation.
Hé, j'ai 16 ans, d'accord ?
Qu'est-ce qu'ils vont me faire ?
C'est pas d'eux que tu dois avoir peur.
Mon collègue rêve d'entrer ici
et de te casser la gueule.
Le flic que tu t'es fait, c'était l'oncle de Herc.
Il va te tuer si personne ne l'en empêche.
Et je suppose que toi,
tu peux l'en empêcher ?
Je refuse de me la jouer comme ça.
Je sais ce que c'est, la cité.
Tu viens d'une cité ?
D'une cité H.L.M. Celle du Eastside.
De la cité ?
J'ai l'impression de me voir en te regardant.
Je crois qu'on devrait essayer de s'entendre.
Tu me proposes quoi ?
Tu veux quoi ?
Je veux...
que tu suces ma bite.
Je vais te défoncer la gueule.
Tu devais jouer le gentil,
espèce de connard.
Quoi ?
- Bonsoir, puis-je vous aider ?
- Oui, on aimerait une table.
Vous avez réservé ?
Non, je croyais
qu'on n'avait qu'à se pointer...
Je vais voir ce que j'ai.
Une table pour deux ?
Veuillez me suivre.
Votre manteau, madame ?
- On pourrait avoir celle-là, là-bas ?
- C'est vendredi,
celles-ci sont réservées.
Laissez-moi vous aider, madame.
- C'est bon, ça va.
- Tenez.
Voilà pour vous, monsieur.
On ne tardera pas
à prendre votre commande.
Tu aurais dû insister, Dee.
Les salauds.
Personne ne répond à la brigade
des mineurs alors qu'on les a appelés.
Apparemment, ils ne sont pas
aussi dévoués que vous deux.
À quelle heure le conseiller arrive ?
Vous avez loupé la consultation de 20 h.
La prochaine est vers minuit.
- Minuit ?
- Et si on vous laissait
Ia paperasse, vous pourriez le garder
jusqu'à ce qu'il arrive ?
Quelle plaie.
Pour les miettes.
Bien sûr.
- Ça t'a plu ?
- Oui.
- Les crevettes étaient excellentes.
- C'était bon, hein ?
Tu crois qu'ils savent ?
Qu'ils savent quoi ?
Tu sais. Ce que je fais.
Comment ça, Dee ?
Arrête, tu vois ce que je veux dire,
c'est comme...
On s'habille bien, non ?
On traverse toute la ville.
On vient dans ce restaurant.
Après le repas, on va aller au port.
On se baladera, tu me suis ?
Comme si on avait fait ça
toute notre vie, tu me suis ?
Et alors ? Ton argent vaut le leur, non ?
Dee, on n'est pas les seuls Blacks ici.
C'est pas ça. C'est par rapport à d'où on...
Arrête, tu vois ce que je veux dire.
J'ai l'impression que mon passé me collera
toujours à la peau,
tu peux faire tout ce que tu voudras,
ça te rattrape toujours, tu comprends ?
- Vous allez prendre un dessert ?
- Oui, merci.
- Vous avez du gâteau au chocolat ?
- Je vais vous montrer.
Tout le monde se fout
de savoir comment tu y es arrivé.
Tu as de l'argent,
tu peux faire tout ce que tu veux.
C'est comme ça que ça marche.
Désolé, monsieur.
Ce sont juste des échantillons.
Et pour vous, monsieur ? Très bien.
Fais pas la pute, avoue.
À toi.
- Avoue que tu as eu tort.
- Ouais, faut que j'avoue
que ce casse-dalle est meilleur
que ceux de Bob, le chinetoque.
T'es peut-être doué pour casser du renoi,
T'es peut-être doué pour casser du renoi,
mais tu vaux que dalle avec cette queue.
- Tu ferais mieux peut-être ?
- Je me défends.
Il dit qu'il se défend.
Possible.
Je me défends encore mieux
avec mes deux mains.
J'ai fait ma petite enquête.
Stinkum dit la vérité.
À part celui qui s'appelle Scar,
celui de New York,
personne ne contrôle Edmondson.
Et le gang de Tee-Tee ?
Non, ils se sont retirés
quand les fédéraux ont débarqué.
La plupart d'entre eux se défoncent
à l'ombre.
Écoute-moi. Approche Scar
et fais-lui un peu peur.
Qu'il comprenne qu'il devrait
prendre le large.
S'il se rebiffe, on lui mettra Wee-Bey et Bird
sur le dos.
- Ouais.
- Une fois qu'on s'en sera débarrassé,
on enverra des petites frappes
régler leur compte aux petits dealers.
Ou, si tu en vois des bons,
- prends-les avec nous.
- Bon, qui j'envoie s'en occuper ?
- Envoie Stinkum.
- Ça marche.
C'est lui qui a vu le coup venir.
Laisse-lui tenter le coup.
Bon, pas mal.
Faut pas que le mec de permanence voie ça.
T'abandonnes ? Tu nous dois déjà 60 $.
C'est peut-être beaucoup pour toi
mais moi, je gagne ça en une seconde.
- Je te laisse casser.
- Vous attendiez le gars des mineurs ?
Il est arrivé.
Dommage, je t'aurais bien écrasé.
Laisse-moi te donner un conseil, Preston.
Tu veux jouer au bandit,
reste sur un terrain que tu connais.
Je t'emmerde,
toi et tes conseils de merde, d'accord ?
Mais ce sandwich était bon.
Tu vas étendre notre business
sur l'avenue Edmondson.
Prends l'allée.
Et Scar ?
Qui ça ?
Écoute, t'auras un pourcentage
sur le total de la came,
alors fais ce qui faut, t'entends ?
Tu travailles pour toi aussi,
alors tu vas vendre de la pure
et mettre les gars du coin dessus.
C'est pas compliqué.
Tu t'organises avec tes gars, tu me suis ?
Va m'attendre en bas. J'arrive.
- On va se faire un max en un clin d'oeil.
- Souris, mec.
- Il avait l'air heureux.
- Ouais, mais il l'a mérité.
Il l'a mérité.
C'est Wee-Bey. On en a un.
- Tu crois que c'est Omar ?
- Non.
- Ça doit être un des petits jeunes.
- On en a eu un, plus que deux, hein ?
Ouais, ces petits enculés.
Qu'ils essaient donc de me baiser !
Un, deux, trois.
- On a un gagnant.
- Un cas semblable ? Lequel ?
Celui que tu viens de m'amener.
La fille tuée par balle dans le Northeast.
- Kresson ?
- Diedre Kresson, c'est ça.
Même mort que les deux cas
de l'année dernière.
- Lesquels ?
- Toreen Boyle...
- Et l'autre, Ligget. C'est dans le rapport.
- Toreen Boyd et Roland Leggett.
Oui, c'est ça.
Dans les trois cas, on a utilisé un 45 mm,
sûrement un Colt Classic.
- Ça, c'est du Landsman. Comment il fait ?
- Tu crois que c'est Landsman ?
Je sais pas, Bunk.
Certes, Jay est un sociopathe,
mais je crois plutôt qu'un gangster a fait ça.
Jimmy, tu es bien assis ?
Vous vous brûlez, saufsi vous avez
ces gants spécial barbecue.
Vous avez un Johnny Weeks ici ?
- Qui ?
- Johnny Weeks.
- Dans la salle de jeu.
- Merci bien.
- T'as du teuchi ?
- J'ai rien sur moi.
T'es là depuis quand ?
Faut laisser le temps au médicament
d'agir sur ton organisme.
Établissement de soins palliatifs Greenhill
Je t'ai amené un truc.
Des morceaux de poulet et des frites.
Je t'avais pris un milk-shake
mais je l'ai renversé dans le bus.
Ça arrive dans un sac
pour en ressortir par un autre.
Tu vas garder ça longtemps ?
- J'ai merdé un max, mon pote.
- Ouais, j'ai vu ça.
- J'ai merdé un max, mon pote.
- Ouais, j'ai vu ça.
Mais je pouvais rien faire, tu comprends ?
D'abord, je prends une branlée,
et après, je récolte ça.
C'est pour quoi ?
Ils disent que je l'ai chopé.
Le sida ?
Ils m'ont fait plein d'analyses...
C'est sûr ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Pas grand-chose, je m'occupe.
Je serais passé plus tôt
mais j'étais en mission spéciale.
- En mission ?
- Ouais. Les salauds qui t'ont tabassé,
ils sont dans la merde.
Eux et les gars qui dealent pour eux aussi.
Quoi ?
Je leur ai foutu les flics au cul.
Les flics ?
- Quoi, ils t'ont obligé ?
- Non, arrête.
Je travaille pas pour eux.
Je travaille avec eux.
S'ils me font mariner avant de me donner
mon badge, je resterai un voyou.
Pourquoi ?
Comment ça, pourquoi ?
Comment tu peux me poser la question ?
Qu'est-ce que tu fous là,
avec ces camés de merde ?
Pourquoi tu pisses dans un sac ?
Pourquoi ils t'ont tabassé ?
Pourquoi j'aurais dû rien faire ?
Mais ça fait partie du jeu, non ?
C'est toi qui m'as appris ça.
Comment tu passes le temps ici ?
- Je vais à des réunions.
- Celles des Narcotiques Anonymes ?
Ouais. Deux fois par jour.
C'est bien, mon pote.
Ça doit faire du bien à ton corps.
- Ouais.
- Non, ça pouvait pas durer.
Sûrement.
Je sortirai d'ici à la fin du mois.
Pas de souci.
Les N.A. se rassemblent partout.
Ne t'inquiète pas pour ça.
Bubs.
Qui deale la meilleure came en ce moment ?
- Arrête un peu.
- Je vais rentrer, hein ?
C'est de la merde qui circule, tu sais ?
Y a toujours des gars sur Baker et Calhoun.
Ils ont vendu de la vraie merde l'autre jour.
- Ah ouais ?
- Certains y sont restés.
T'es quelqu'un, hein ?
On te tabasse, tu pisses dans un sac
mais t'en redemandes.
Je suis un Viking, mon pote.
"Je suis un Viking, mon pote."
McNulty.
Y a un truc ici qui demande à être embrassé.
Compte pas là-dessus, pauvre crétin.
Tu dois savoir
pourquoi j'ai plus de galons que toi.
Bien joué, Jay. Mais si Keeley
n'avait pas merdé sur les lieux,
on aurait fait le lien y a longtemps, non ?
Laisse Keeley en paix.
On ne peut pas tous être des princes
de la ville, non ?
En parlant de ça...
assieds-toi.
Je peux te poser une question
importante pour ton avenir ?
- Quoi ?
- Pour qui travailles-tu ?
Je te demande, et ça restera entre nous,
qui tu considères comme ton chef.
- Le major Rawls.
- Super.
En gardant ça à l'esprit, je te conseille
d'aller de ce pas dans son bureau
pour lui annoncer les nouvelles
sur l'affaire Kresson,
et sois bien gentil. Parce que
je t'ai sauvé la mise.
Voilà ce que je te propose.
Tu règles cette histoire avec les Stups
en 15 jours.
Tu reprends ta place à la Crim
dans une équipe de nuit.
Fais ça, et tu seras à nouveau
dans mes petits papiers.
- Merci, Jay.
- Y a pas de quoi.
C'est pas juste.
On bosse, on nous paie.
C'est ce que je dis.
Je vais lui en parler, d'accord ?
- Fais-le.
- Sérieux.
- Ça gaze, Dee ?
- Et toi, Shorty ?
530 $, le compte est bon.
Bon, y a de la fraîche qui arrive.
Va prévenir Sterling.
Ça marche. Hé, Dee, mon pote.
Moi et Poot,
on t'a jamais laissé tomber, pas vrai ?
On n'a jamais fait d'embrouilles, hein ?
Non.
Alors on se demandait si tu pouvais
nous donner une petite avance
en attendant le jour de paie parce que là,
on est vraiment sur la paille.
Bon, celui qui a tué cette fille
a aussi réglé leur compte à Boyd et Ligget.
- Leggett.
- On sait que ces deux meurtres étaient
reliés à une histoire de drogue.
Le nom de Dee n'apparaît nulle part.
Mais quelqu'un a parlé de lui,
- une certaine Tywanda.
- Qui ça ?
Celle qui nous a contactés pour Kresson.
- Je vois.
- Elle accuse Dee.
T'as vu ça ?
Hé, Jay.
Et l'ours dit :
"Tu n'es pas venu chasser, hein ?"
- Tu as lu le rapport de samedi ?
- Dimanche matin.
Tu as lu celui de Worden sur le Westside ?
John Bailey, avec son gilet pare-balles,
s'est fait allumer par trois gars.
Rue Carey.
Tu as fait le lien avec Kresson,
mais t'as pas pensé
à relier Bailey à Barksdale ?
On travaille jamais ensemble avec Worden.
J'essaie de résoudre mes affaires, putain.
Tony, sur la trois.
Vous en avez mis du temps !
On a dû vous dire
qu'y a pas mal de meurtres à Baltimore,
parfois, on n'y arrive plus.
- On ne vous a pas suivis ?
- Pourquoi on l'aurait été ?
Diedre était entourée de gens dangereux.
Comme qui ?
Vous avez dit à un de nos inspecteurs,
après le meurtre,
que vous lui aviez parlé
le soir où elle a été tuée.
Elle m'avait appelée. Tard.
On n'a pas beaucoup parlé, elle disait
qu'elle devait filer. Dee l'attendait.
C'est la dernière fois
que vous lui avez parlé ?
- Oui, elle a été tuée ce soir-là.
- Elle sortait avec Dee ?
Non, Dee était son neveu, un truc du genre.
Dee, ce serait donc D'Angelo Barksdale.
Et le petit-ami, Avon Barksdale ?
Et le petit-ami, Avon Barksdale ?
Vous connaissez Avon ?
Je vous retourne la question.
Vous traînez avec sa bande ?
Avant, oui,
mais plus depuis ce qui s'est passé
avec Diedre. C'est trop.
On sortait entre nanas
à la boîte de nuit Odell,
et une fois, on l'a vu entouré
de sa cour, il avait loué un coin,
il commandait des verres,
comme si le monde lui appartenait.
Et Diedre s'est fait avoir.
- Et vous ?
- Je vais être honnête avec vous.
Je suis sortie avec eux
pendant un moment, mais...
dans ce genre d'endroit,
tout le monde trempe dans un truc louche.
Mais Diedre sortait avec Avon ?
Elle est sortie avec lui pendant un an,
et puis il s'est passé un truc. Vers la fin,
elle était devenue super possessive,
ce qui ne plaisait pas à Avon,
il sortait avec d'autres filles.
Elle l'accusait de tout une minute,
pleurait la minute d'après,
et lui lançait plein de menaces.
- Elle a menacé Avon Barksdale ?
- Elle n'avait plus toute sa tête.
Une fois, elle l'a menacé
de le balancer dans une lettre.
- Dans une lettre.
- Une lettre adressée au procureur.
Elle disait qu'elle faisait partie de sa famille.
Elle disait que s'il la larguait,
elle balancerait sur la drogue.
- Elle a écrit cette lettre ?
- Je ne sais pas.
J'ai essayé de la raisonner,
mais elle ne voulait rien savoir.
Elle s'est même disputée avec lui
en public, dans sa boîte.
Quoi, Avon a une boîte ?
Chez Orlando, une boîte de strip-tease.
- Elle est à lui ?
- C'est ce que Diedre disait.
Elle disait qu'il possédait un tas de trucs.
Chez Orlando - Club pour Messieurs
Chez Orlando - Club pour Messieurs
- Dis-moi, mon pote.
- Quoi ?
Tu peux diriger cet endroit
sans faire une overdose de minou ?
Tu parles.
Occupe-toi de ces salopes
et de tous leurs problèmes quelques jours.
Tu verras que tu préféreras tenir
une laverie automatique que ce bordel.
Tu te débrouilles bien dans la cour, il paraît.
- Ouais, si on veut.
- Quoi, tu trouves que tu te fais pas assez ?
Mon oncle me verse juste un petit salaire.
Bon sang.
Ton oncle n'est pas dur juste avec toi.
Quoi ?
Arrête, tu t'en sors pas avec ce club ?
Je suis sûr que ça doit te rapporter gros.
Tu te trompes.
Je suis juste une couverture,
pour le permis de boisson.
- Ce que je veux dire...
- Putain !
T'as un problème ?
C'était pour le verre d'avant.
C'était pour celui-là.
J'ai rien contre ton oncle,
mais faudrait qu'il soit plus cool.
Y en a pour tout le monde.
Tu l'as dit.
Tu sais que ça va changer pour Stinkum ?
Il passe au pourcentage.
- Quoi ?
- Il va gérer son propre territoire.
Il prend les coins
près de Edmondson et Brice.
Tu dis que mon oncle a filé ça à Stink ?
Je pensais que tu savais.
Orlando !
Excuse-moi, tu veux bien venir m'aider ?
- J'ai déjà payé mon dernier verre.
- C'était pour celui d'avant.
- C'était pour celui-là.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Il refuse de payer,
alors que je lui ai déjà fait cadeau de 20 $.
- Elle m'a pris 20 $, puis 20 $ de plus.
- C'est faux.
Pourquoi tu te paies ma tête ?
Ça fait une heure et demie
que je t'offre à boire.
C'est pas honnête. Je viens de dépenser
1 20 $ en alcool et 40 $ de pourboire.
Et tu veux en plus me faire les poches ?
- Je rêve !
- Dehors, faites-le sortir d'ici.
Je t'ai à peine frôlé le genou.
Je me conduis en gentleman
et c'est comme ça que tu me remercies ?
Attends !
Pourquoi tu as fait ça ?
- Tu lui avais pris son argent ?
- Non.
Tu m'offres un verre ?
On pourrait se voir ?
Ailleurs qu'ici, je veux dire.
Je sors rarement avec les hommes
que je rencontre ici.
D'habitude.
Quelle boîte a une caméra de surveillance
à l'entrée ?
Ça m'étonnerait que ce soit pour les filles.
Alors il a un club de strip-tease,
un entrepôt,
Ies appartements près du parc,
I'entreprise de remorquage,
et c'est tout ce dont il avait parlé
à la fille qui est morte.
- Tous ces biens vont réjouir le major.
- L'adjoint aussi.
Il n'y a rien de tel que des confiscations
de ce genre pour renflouer notre budget.
Vois avec les impôts
quel nom ils ont donné.
Vois si le club a été déclaré.
La Crim a mis la main sur un gars
samedi soir. Ça pourrait nous intéresser.
John Bailey, un pro des attaques
à main armée. Il était avec les Murphy.
Son gilet pare-balles n'a pas suffi.
On a retrouvé 39 douilles,
de trois armes différentes.
Toutes ces balles pour de la came,
mais c'était surtout
parce qu'il bossait pour Omar.
Regardez, c'est notre ami.
OUVERT
Juste une fois,
j'aimerais que ce soit un vrai numéro.
Pas son genre d'être en retard.
Bailey, putain de junkie. Je te jure,
putain, on ne peut jamais compter sur eux.
Pourquoi tu parles toujours comme ça ?
- Quoi ?
- "P" par-ci, "P" par-là.
Si je ne le disais pas,
j'oublierais la moitié de ce que je veux dire.
Personne ne souhaite entendre
ce vilain mot.
Surtout quand il sort d'une si belle bouche.
On attend Bailey ?
Le monde appartient à ceux
qui se lèvent tôt.
- Je t'ai bipé.
- J'ai rien reçu.
- Fais-moi voir.
- Tu veux voir mon pager ?
Vas-y, Prez, tu veux voir mon pager ?
- Toi aussi, je t'ai bipée.
- Ça va, Prez ?
714-3432 ?
Je l'ai bien reçu. C'était toi ?
Tu as essayé ?
Oui. Deux fois.
Numéro hors service.
Ça aurait marché si t'avais su le décoder.
Merde, je suis aussi surpris que vous.
J'aime les grilles de mots mystères.
Vous savez,
quand il faut découvrir les mots cachés.
Je me suis dit que je pourrais faire
la même chose avec les chiffres.
Prenons le numéro que je t'ai envoyé.
Prends le sept,
et fais-le passer par-dessus le cinq.
Tu tombes sur le trois.
Fais passer le un par-dessus le cinq,
tu tombes sur le neuf.
Avec le quatre, tu tombes sur le six.
Trois, c'est sept, quatre, c'est six,
trois à nouveau,
et deux, c'est huit.
Zéro permute avec cinq.
Alors 714-3432, ça nous fait :
396-7678.
Notre numéro.
C'est leur code ?
Ça marche, parce que c'est juste
une question de position des chiffres.
Si c'était un code avec des maths,
de l'algèbre ou autre,
ces petits crétins de la cité
seraient incapables de piger.
Là, il suffit de composer le chiffre
qui est de l'autre côté du cinq.
C'est pas des maths. Il suffit
de regarder le combiné.
Prez, t'es un vrai génie !
- Seigneur !
- Je pourrais te tuer de joie.
Ta mère me fait chier
pour que je le sorte d'ici,
que je le mette dans un bon établissement.
Tu sais, elle ne laissera pas tomber.
Je n'arrête pas de lui dire qu'on peut pas
encore se servir du fric,
surtout qu'il n'a aucune assurance médicale.
Mais c'est pour bientôt.
Alors, t'aimes pas trop venir ici, hein ?
Non.
Écoute-moi,
il reste ton oncle, tu me suis ?
- On est en famille.
- Je sais.
C'est la famille qui compte, rien d'autre.
Ta famille sera toujours là,
c'est les liens du sang.
Bon sang.
Tu ne t'attendais pas à ça, hein ?
On a la vie qu'on mérite. C'est normal.
Il n'arrêtait pas de dire des conneries
de ce genre et il y croyait, tu me suis ?
Qu'est-ce que t'as ? Dis-moi.
Tu sais, t'as raison.
C'est dur pour moi d'être ici.
Il te fait peur, hein ?
- Tu sais, c'est juste que...
- Moi, il me fait peur.
S'il mourrait, je trouverais ça moins dur.
Vu comment on a grandi, on s'attend à ça.
On l'attend.
Tu vois,
il te suffit de merder juste une seule fois.
T'es trop lent, tu réagis trop tard.
Une seule fois suffit.
Et comment tu veux ne jamais être lent,
ne jamais réagir trop tard ?
Tu peux pas prévoir ce genre de connerie.
C'est la vie.
Ça fout les jetons.
Ils l'utilisent toujours.
J'étais là samedi soir et il avait disparu.
Alors que tu bossais pas ?
Tu récupères les garçons ?
Oui, ce soir, juste pour la nuit.
C'est parti.
Qu'est-ce qu'ils font ?
On appelle les renforts ?
Pas encore.
Voyons voir un peu.
Une invitation.
J'appellerais bien des renforts.
Ouais, moi aussi.
Super.
- J'inspecte l'arrière.
- Je m'occupe d'eux.
Bonjour, messieurs.
Si tu avais dû t'en servir,
tu l'aurais déjà fait.
C'est bon.
Je fais toujours tout pour.
Pour organiser ce genre de petite rencontre,
faut que ce soit bon, non ?
Omar qui sort sans arme ?
Ça doit être une première.
Des fois, c'est pas la peine.
J'ai vu que vous me surveilliez,
j'avais envie de vous faire gagner du temps.
Jouer franc-jeu.
J'ai rien fait. Vous me foutrez pas en taule.
On n'est pas là pour ça, Omar.
Tu nous intéresses
car on a un problème en commun.
- Un problème ?
- Barksdale.
- C'est pas un problème.
- Pas sûr.
Avon décalque pas mal de monde
en ce moment. Et vu qui tu es...
Vu sous cet angle,
il peut devenir mon problème,
mais je peux pas vraiment vous aider.
Vous me suivez ?
Moucharder, c'est pas mon truc.
Moi, je crois que c'est pas trop comme ça
que ça marche.
Et on le comprend bien.
Si jamais tu te fais pincer,
moi, c'est McNulty, elle, c'est Greggs.
Appelle-nous, on pourrait s'entendre.
Pourquoi pas.
Tu sais, je bossais dans la cité
du temps de ton frère.
Si tu le vois,
dis-lui qu'ils ont réglé son compte
à John Bailey hier soir.
Un bon.
Beaucoup d'ennemis.
Tu vois Bird en ce moment ?
On dit qu'il a descendu un travailleur.
Attends, une minute. Joue pas avec moi.
Un travailleur ? Quoi, Bird ?
Allez, c'était juste un travailleur, non ?
Et Bird ?
Je pense que votre indic pourra vous aider.
Merde, Bubbles connaît Bird.
Vous restez encore longtemps ?
Un peu.
Vous avez une minute ?
Bien sûr, asseyez-vous.
Non, je préfère rester debout.
Ça fait 13 ans que je fais ce boulot.
Je m'en plains pas.
Personne ne m'a forcé la main.
Mais maintenant que je suis là,
je tiens à vous dire un truc.
Toute la cité devrait être sur écoute
depuis belle lurette.
Si c'était le cas, on aurait tous les caïds.
Et je dirais même
qu'on aurait mis la main sur leur fric.
Je sais que vous avez vraiment envie
de prendre du grade,
mais je sais aussi que c'est pas évident,
en ce qui me concerne,
je ne lance pas de grande opération
si je ne suis pas sûr du résultat.
J'apprécie votre franchise.
Bonsoir, lieutenant.
T'as dit quoi à Dee pour qu'il nous paie ?
Que sinon, on arrêtait de lui filer
ce qu'on ramasse.
- Putain.
- Écoute.
Faut savoir foutre la pression.
- C'est lui.
- C'est qui ?
Un des gars qui nous a entubés.
Le visage pâle.
C'est lui ?
Bon, viens.
Je suis vraiment le meilleur.
- Alors on attend ?
- Ouais.
- Ça marche.
- Bon.
C'est Scar.
Là, en bleu ?
- Le numéro 80 ?
- Ouais, je m'en charge.
Bon, tu l'as ?
- Trouve vite un téléphone.
- Une embrouille ?
On dirait que mon pote Dee a une urgence.
Il s'est encore mis dans la merde ?
Hé, t'as besoin de quoi ?
Mes gars sont sur un des mecs de Omar,
chez le Grec.
Sérieux ? Bon, bouge pas. Je m'en charge.
Bon.
Je vois personne débarquer.
Dee nous a dit d'attendre.
Dee nous a dit d'attendre.
Je te l'avais bien dit.
- Il est toujours là ?
- Ouais, il joue au flipper.
Super. Bien joué, petit.
Comment tu t'appelles ?
- Wallace.
- Wallace, super.
Il va nous le montrer, vu ?
ÉCONOMISEZ - Appelez en P.C.V.
Ouais.
C'est fait. Bien joué, mon frère.
Super.
Debout ! Allez mec, lève-toi !
Mince. Allez, debout !
Y a école. Vous allez être en retard !
Allez. Faut se lever.
Allez ! Debout.
- Putain, Wallace.
- Y a pas de putain !
Vous savez ce qui se passe
si vous ratez l'école ?
Ils vont se pointer et vous allez atterrir
dans une famille d'accueil.
Si vous voulez une famille d'accueil,
restez tranquillement au lit.
Casse-toi, mec. Merde, c'est pas le moment.
- Les Stups ?
- Non, les flics.
Où est le petit-déj' ?
Tiens. Prends tes chips.
- Je veux deux paquets.
- Non, un seul.
Allez, t'es difficile. Prends les chips !
Allez, prends ton jus.
Allez.
Où est mon paquet ?
Va voir ton maître. Allez.
POUR LES ANIMAUX PRIS AU PlÉGE
APPELEZ AU 396-6286
- Où est ton cartable ?
- J'avais pas de devoirs.
C'est le pire suicide que j'aie vu.
C'est lui.
Tu le vois ?
C'est lui, là.
C'est le pote d'Omar.

"... et chaque élément est important."
-- Freamon
- Qu'est-ce que je vais pouvoir lui dire ?
- Ce qu'il voudra entendre, Jimmy.
Le fils prodigue.
Major, on a de bonnes chances
d'élucider quelques affaires.
- Une...
- Vous n'êtes pas là pour ça.
Je me fous des affaires. Asseyez-vous.
Calmez-vous.
Je suis un mec raisonnable.
Où que j'aille, on me dit :
"Bill Rawls, vous êtes un putain
de mec raisonnable."
- C'est pas vrai, Jay ?
- Oui, vous êtes raisonnable.
En effet, je le suis.
Et vu que votre sergent sait
que je suis raisonnable,
il est venu raisonner avec moi il y a peu.
N'est-ce pas, Jay ?
En effet, nous avons raisonné.
Nous avons raisonné et établi
que malgré son ascendance irlandaise
et sa manie de parler sans y être invité,
Jimmy McNulty bosse bien.
Ça vaut la peine de le garder.
- Major, je ne suis...
- Beau gosse, hein ?
Savez-vous ce qu'on fait ici, McNulty ?
Ce qu'on fait ici ?
C'était une... Comment déjà ?
Une question qui ne nécessite pas...
Une question rhétorique.
Vous avez usé de rhétorique.
Vous êtes rhétoricien et raisonnable.
Ici, on élucide les affaires de meurtres
qui se présentent, une à la fois.
Ça s'appelle la rotation.
Vous bossez tant qu'elle n'est pas élucidée.
Puis vous y repensez,
et un collègue vous relaie.
Un moyen simple et efficace de bosser
dans une ville
qui compte 250 à 300 affaires par an.
Oui, major.
Mais si quelqu'un décide
de renoncer à la rotation,
ça alourdit injustement la charge de travail
des autres inspecteurs.
Les flics surmenés font des erreurs.
Les erreurs freinent
le nombre d'affaires élucidées.
Cela peut rendre une personne
aussi raisonnable que moi...
Déraisonnable.
Inspecteur McNulty, vous vous repointerez
ici la semaine prochaine
Iorsque vous devrez travailler de nuit.
Cible : 410.921 .5389 - Pager Activé
Appel reçu : 07:57:24
- Il est matinal, aujourd'hui.
- Son pager a été très actif hier soir aussi.
T'es pire qu'une femme.
Mais tu me trouves bien, non ?
Tu as fait tout ça ?
- J'ai fait cuire quelques oeufs. C'est rien.
- Ah bon ?
Maman me disait toujours :
"Ne les laisse pas cuisiner.
"Une fois dans ta cuisine,
elles voudront la clé de ta maison."
Je ne veux pas de clé, ni de maison.
Et ta maman ne sait rien sur moi.
Il te ressemble.
Oui, c'est vrai.
Où est sa mère ?
Pas loin.
Vous n'êtes pas restés amis ?
Elle veut une clé...
elle veut une maison, une voiture,
de nouveaux vêtements, un collier,
de l'argent, un petit tour à l'océan,
une carte de crédit à son nom.
Rien de tout cela n'est gratuit, hein ?
Avec les chattes, y a rien de gratuit.
Je dois y aller.
J'ai bossé sur celui-là.
Tu auras les lignes pour les deux autres
téléphones publics demain.
- C'est installé ?
- Sur les cabines des pavillons, oui.
Écoutons-le.
Ce queje veux dire, c'est qu'il a payé
personne, il se croit tout permis.
Tu vois ce queje veux dire ?
J'ai pas un sou. Rien.
Putain, t'es sérieuse ?
Il se sent plus pisser
parce que sa famille est derrière lui.
- Ça devenait intéressant.
- Y a pas de monitorage.
Pardon ?
On ne peut pas écouter la conversation
d'une cabine sans monitorage.
- Ça veut dire quoi ?
- Y a un micro dans la cabine du parc.
Demain, on en aura deux près des tours.
On n'a pas le droit d'écouter
sauf si une de nos cibles est au téléphone.
On va poireauter des heures
sur les toits des H.L.M.
pour surveiller ces connards au téléphone ?
Eh oui.
C'est merdique.
Inspecteur, on fait notre boulot, ici.
En venant à la Brigade criminelle,
vous vous attendiez à quoi ?
Tu vas faire quoi ?
Je peux pas revenir dans une semaine,
l'enquête est en bonne voie.
Tu l'as dit à Rawls ?
- Non.
- McNulty, un appel sur la 3.
Allô ?
Où ça ?
Le bloc 800, derrière. C'est bon.
Merci. Oui.
On attend toujours la P.J.
Dans combien de temps ?
Ils sont tous occupés.
- Ce clebs a aussi effrayé Nars.
- T'aurais pu me prévenir, non ?
C'était trop marrant.
Merde.
C'est un des vôtres ?
Il portait un pare-balles,
comme celui que Worden avait chopé.
- Il pourrait y avoir un rapport.
- Oui, y en a un.
Comment ça ?
Je connais pas son nom,
mais il fait partie d'un gang armé.
Je connais pas son nom,
mais il fait partie d'un gang armé.
Ils ont braqué une planque de came.
Barksdale se venge.
- C'est la totale.
- Ils ont dû le buter quatre ou cinq fois.
Au moins 1 2 coups de couteau, des brûlures
de cigarettes. Torturé à mort.
Ils n'ont pas dû le faire ici.
Ils l'ont tabassé ailleurs
et l'ont ramené ici, à la vue de tous.
- Des indices ?
- Pas encore.
On surveille des cabines.
Si j'apprends un truc, vous le saurez.
- Emmenez 22.
- 22.
Des nouvelles ?
Ou est-ce qu'on va le laisser moisir ici ?
- Vous attendez la P.J. ?
- Depuis plus d'une heure.
Y a deux équipes de rue.
Elles sont chez le maire.
- Que s'est-il passé ?
- On lui a volé son matériel de jardin.
Ils photographient sa terrasse vide,
cherchent des empreintes sur son portillon.
Je rigole pas.
Si vous trouvez quelqu'un
qui peut arranger cette brigade
je vous file mes heures sup.
Ils l'ont poignardé.
Il était étripé.
Ils l'ont vraiment amoché.
Parfois il faut faire passer un message.
Quand tu les as appelés pour le dénoncer,
tu t'attendais à quoi ?
- Ça fait partie du jeu. Tu le sais.
- Ouais.
Comme toi et cette fille ?
- Quelle fille ?
- Celle de l'appart.
Tu nous en as parlé, tu t'en souviens ?
J'aime ce que tu as dit
sur toutes ces tueries, tu sais ?
Surtout le fait
que c'était pas obligé d'être comme ça.
Vends la dope et c'est tout.
Prends-moi un Canada Dry
et prends-toi un truc.
Je m'en souviens.
Mais ce n'est pas le cas, hein ?
Je sais. Je vois bien.
Je pense à son oeil. Il était crevé.
Et l'autre était ouvert.
Hé, Dee, ça me fout les jetons.
C'est comme s'il espionnait,
qu'il voyait tout.
N'y pense plus.
- Putain !
- Hé.
Oublie cette merde.
Oublie ça.
Barksdale passe un appel.
Il envoie un message.
- Salut.
- Quoi de neuf ?
Attends.
Salut, Strings ! C'est Dee.
- Oui.
- Tu m'as contacté ?
Je voulais savoir si tu connaissais
lejeune dealer qui bosse là-bas.
- Lequel ?
- Le givré qui a cogné le flic.
- Oui, et alors ?
- Il a des problèmes, d'accord ?
- Comment ça ?
- Assez pour le ramener, d'accord ?
Comme tu veux, mec.
D'accord.
Ils ramènent Bodie à la maison.
Y avait un jeune avec lui,
le gamin à peau claire du cimetière.
Où ça ?
Dans l'allée derrière le bloc 800 d'Argyle,
en face des pavillons.
Tué ?
- Poignardé, frappé, brûlé.
- Seigneur.
- On va voir Omar.
- D'accord.
Impressionnant.
C'est rare de voir un accusé si bien préparé
pour une rencontre préliminaire.
En plus des déclarations signées
par les sponsors de Preston
à la Ligue athlétique de police,
j'ai également une copie photographiée
d'un chèque encaissé
qui indique qu'il est inscrit aux cours
du lycée public de Baltimore.
Puis-je savoir comment ce jeune homme
peut s'offrir, non pas 1,
- mais 2 avocats de votre cabinet, M. Levy ?
- C'est gratuit, Votre Honneur.
Mon cabinet s'efforce d'aider
de jeunes délinquants
à remettre leur vie sur les rails.
Veuillez m'excuser, mais je constate
que votre client est accusé de délinquance,
pour avoir vendu des stupéfiants
et avoir agressé un officier de police.
Il s'est évadé
d'un centre de rééducation juvénile.
Votre Honneur,
mon client est prêt à reconnaître
qu'il a été impliqué dans la vente
de petites quantités de drogue,
une transaction qui n'a pas été rétribuée,
car il a été manipulé
par des dealers plus vieux, de son quartier.
- C'était une erreur, Votre Honneur.
- J'en prends acte.
Nous ajouterons que Preston a été victime
d'un violent tabassage policier,
dont il porte encore les marques,
Votre Honneur.
Il y a répondu violemment,
mais par autodéfense, Votre Honneur.
Et pour l'évasion ?
Preston était drogué aux médicaments
en quittant le centre Cheltenham.
Dans cet état, Votre Honneur,
il voulait juste retourner
chez sa grand-mère.
Étais-tu conscient de tes actes
en quittant le Centre pour mineurs ?
- Non, j'étais drogué.
- Souhaites-tu rajouter quelque chose ?
Juste...
Je sais pas...
Je suis prêt à bien agir.
Dans l'attente d'une décision définitive
prévue dans six mois,
je place le défendeur sous liberté surveillée
chez sa grand-mère.
Votre Honneur, j'ai bien peur
que Mme Brodus n'ait pas de téléphone
pour recevoir ces appels de surveillance.
Elle est à la retraite.
Et s'il appelait son agent de surveillance
deux fois par semaine ?
Cool. Comme vous voulez...
Votre Honneur.
JAMES McNULTY
INSPECTEUR DE LA CRIM 9-1-1
- Bubbles, quoi de neuf ?
- Salut, Johnny.
- Ça va bien ?
- Oui.
- Ça va bien ?
- Oui.
- C'est quoi, cette arnaque ?
- Y a pas d'arnaque.
Merci, madame.
Ce que tu vois, c'est du travail honnête
pour un salaire honnête. Hein, Lavelle ?
M. Droit Chemin, Bubbles.
Il faut riposter
quand ils s'y attendent le moins.
Moi et Uck, on est sur un coup.
On a un plan.
- Déconne pas.
- Sérieux.
On va dévaliser la société de plomberie.
Merde, t'es sorti depuis deux jours
et tu me joues ce tour.
- La plomberie.
- C'est obligé, mec.
- Et la clôture ?
- Nique la clôture.
- Et le chien ?
- Nique le chien.
En me reposant, j'ai eu le temps de réfléchir.
Ça m'a fait du bien.
La société de plomberie. C'est vicieux.
J'y vais, tu peux me payer ?
Si tu n'as plus de rêves, Bubs,
tu n'as plus rien, non ?
Merci. Viens, rêveur.
Allô.
- Y en a un qui appelle.
- C'est bon, je l'ai.
- Carv est toujours là ?
- Un instant.
Carv, t'as un appel !
- Oui, allô ?
- Devine qui je suis en train de mater.
Il a encore été relâché ?
Gong ! Round numéro trois.
- Salut.
- Quoi de neuf, mec ?
- Quoi de neuf, Stink ?
- Fais gaffe à ce que tu dis.
- Ah oui, désolé.
- Tu dois rester sur tes gardes, mec.
J'ai oublié.
- Quoi de neuf ? T'es où ?
- Et toi ?
Je suis dans la cour. Je viens de rentrer,
j'ai pas vu un chat,
je voulaisjuste me tenir au courant.
Rien de nouveau dernièrement.
Viens nous voir demain, mec.
- D'accord ?
- D'accord.
Bien. À plus.
Pertinent - Pas pertinent
COUR - CABINE 2
"Pas pertinent" ?
Pourquoi c'est pas pertinent ?
Rien sur la drogue.
Ils ont des codes
pour masquer leur pager et leur numéro.
Si quelqu'un appelle,
ils ne mentionnent pas de nom.
Et si quelqu'un mentionne un nom,
il est rappelé à l'ordre.
Ce sont des preuves tangibles.
- De quoi ?
- D'une conspiration.
D'une conspiration ?
On bâtit quelque chose ici, inspecteur.
On le bâtit à partir de zéro.
Chaque élément est important.
Compris ?
Merde.
Merde !
T'es sérieux, connard ?
Va te faire foutre.
Si tu t'évades encore du Centre,
on te tabasse encore.
- Ça me va si ça te va.
- Je m'évade de nulle part, mec.
Regarde dans ma poche arrière.
- "Liberté surveillée" ?
- Ouais, mec.
Si tu demandais avant de tabasser
des mecs, t'aurais moins de problèmes.
Comment t'as été relâché ?
T'es pas fute-fute, mec.
Le juge des mineurs.
Il a reconnu mon potentiel.
Il attend des trucs de moi.
Ouais, par exemple ?
La fac, l'école de droit ou de médecine,
un truc du genre.
- Sérieusement, comment t'es sorti ?
- Je vais vous dire un truc.
Ce n'est que mon opinion,
mais le système pour mineurs de cette ville
est merdique. C'est une grosse blague.
Putain de merde !
Si vous me déposez chez ma grand-mère,
j'oublie tout ça.
À l'arrière, connard.
Barre-toi de là !
Salope !
- Salut.
- Salut.
Quoi ? T'as besoin de quoi ?
- C'est drôle que t'arrives déjà à te payer ça !
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?
- C'est pour ma tante, elle a gagné au loto.
- Tu me piques du fric, Cass ?
Quoi ?
T'as l'air en forme.
- C'est parce que j'ai baisé hier soir.
- Vraiment ? T'as pas trop mal au cul ?
- Appelle Jimmy.
- Quoi de neuf, chef ?
Rawls a finalement pu lire le rapport
que McNulty lui a donné.
Il veut un mandat d'arrêt
pour l'affaire Diedre Kresson
et les deux meurtres de la cité
pour lesquels l'arme a été identifiée.
Je sais.
- Jay, tu dois empêcher ça.
- Je peux pas. Rawls les veut aujourd'hui.
Bon, pas de problème. Qui doit-on arrêter ?
T'as un témoin qui a reconnu
D'Angelo Barksdale
sur les lieux du meurtre,
la nuit où il a eu lieu.
Les mêmes balles ont tué
la fille Kresson et les deux truands
dans la cité où traîne Barksdale.
Utilise ces preuves.
Ces preuves ne convaincront pas
le jury d'accusation.
Arrête d'abord le truand
et développe tout ça après.
Appelle Jimmy pour lui dire.
Salut.
Écoutez, y a du changement.
Wallace, tu vas aller vendre la dope
avec Latroy et Peaches.
Et Sterling ?
Il va rester sur Crescent
pendant un moment. Cassandra aussi.
- Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
- Rien.
- Pourquoi tu veux qu'on change de taf ?
- Renoi, t'as besoin que je te l'explique ?
Le pager de Stringer Bell ?
- Celui de Stinkum aussi, c'est sûr.
- Excellent.
S'ils changeaient d'endroit,
y aurait plus de problème.
Ils sont un peu fainéants
et ils vont un peu trop souvent
dans la cabine de la cour.
Seigneur.
Bourré à 9 h du matin ?
Ou de la nuit d'avant.
Inspecteur.
Inspecteur Polk.
McNulty à l'appareil. Bunk m'a bipé.
D'accord.
Pourquoi êtes-vous venu aujourd'hui ?
- Je devais...
- Pour faire acte de présence ?
Pour signer un rapport ?
J'ai été absent la semaine dernière,
lieutenant, mais...
J'ai votre rapport quotidien
de ces deux dernières semaines.
Écrit deux fois par Carv, deux fois par Prez
et une fois par McNulty.
Ils vous ont couvert.
Moi, je ne le ferai pas.
Lieutenant, je...
J'en sais rien. Je ne suis pas vraiment prêt
pour ces histoires de drogue.
Si Mahone était là, je serais
peut-être plus emballé,
j'apprendrais de nouveaux trucs.
Renvoyez-moi faire du civil,
et tout le monde sera content.
Vous renvoyer là-bas pour que vous
vous soûliez encore deux semaines ?
Je ne le ferai pas.
- Lieutenant, s'il...
- Vous m'avez été imposé, Augie.
Mais ça suffit.
Moi, je n'inflige ça à personne.
Soit vous allez sur les toits
pour surveiller les cabines avec les autres,
soit vous allez vous faire soigner.
- Soigner ?
- Pour alcoolisme.
Soit vous allez en désintox,
soit vous montez sur ces toits bourré.
Réfléchissez-y un instant.
- Où sont les autres ?
- Qui ça ?
Lieutenant,
il nous faut des dossiers de rangement.
Toute cette paperasse,
y en a beaucoup.
Lieutenant...
Monsieur,
je vais aller...
Bonne chance pour l'enquête.
Ce con de Rawls bousille l'enquête
car il m'en veut.
Non, il la bousille pour classer
des affaires importantes. T'y es pour rien.
Il a juste un témoin secondaire
qui a reconnu D'Angelo
et un rapport balistique impliquant
deux meurtres sans rapport. Ça suffit pas !
Il peut l'inculper de tout et rien
pour classer l'affaire.
Le jury n'accuse pas,
il lâche l'affaire, fait son chiffre.
- Je vais aller lui dire ce que j'en pense.
- Non.
J'essaie de construire un truc ici.
Rawls fait tout foirer.
- T'en parles à Landsman ?
- Jay n'y fera rien.
Rawls a exigé que les mandats
soient prêts pour demain.
Il va inculper pour meurtre sans preuves
pour le pourcentage ?
Ce qui va saloper notre enquête.
Si on file l'info balistique, le mobile
du meurtre de Kresson
et les pièces à conviction,
Avon Barksdale va changer de plan.
Et ce qu'il ne changera pas, sera blanchi.
Il faut le dire à Rawls.
Il s'en fout.
Il veut juste mon retour et le pourcentage.
- Faut le dire à Daniels.
- Daniels ?
- C'est son enquête, il se battra.
- Il ne fera rien.
Il joue parfois au dur,
mais c'est un homme bien.
Tu rigoles ou quoi ?
Ça fait des semaines qu'il fait tout ralentir.
Il va s'en servir pour tout laisser tomber.
Il va falloir prendre une décision bientôt.
Désolé.
- Freamon.
- Fais gaffe à toi, Bunk.
On le dit à Daniels.
Rien à battre
de ce mouchard carriériste de merde.
Tu proposes quoi ?
On va le voir. S'il se bat, génial.
S'il refile ça à Rawls, tant pis, on n'allait
pas élucider l'affaire de toute façon.
Bon, venez.
PLOMBERIE DU QUARTIER OUEST
Espèce de con !
- Lève-toi, connard.
- J'ai mal.
Tu fais quoi ? Me touche pas !
- Tu te drogues ou quoi ?
- Oui, un peu.
Allez, lève-toi.
Tu veux m'achever ?
- Putain.
- Tu veux me tuer ou quoi ?
- Attends ! Où vas-tu ?
- Il faut trouver de l'aide.
Ne pars pas. Reste avec moi.
Allons sur le trottoir.
Va chercher de l'aide ! T'attends quoi ?
Reste ici !
- Putain ! Qu'est-ce qui a giclé ?
- De la soupe à l'oignon. Campbell's.
- Super, mon plan !
- Cours, Forrest, cours !
Allez voir Foerster ou le préfet adjoint.
Pourquoi venez-vous me supplier ?
Allez voir votre ami le juge, non ?
Je ne connais pas de juge fédéral
qui puisse empêcher
Ie chef de la criminelle de juger
ces trois meurtres,
même si ces affaires sont minces.
C'est maintenant ou jamais, lieutenant.
- Défendez-nous ou envoyez-nous balader.
- C'est à moi de faire ça ?
Je ne vois pas
qui d'autre pourrait s'en charger.
- Rawls est major.
- Rawls est un enculé.
Je veux dire que c'est mon supérieur.
La hiérarchie,
vous vous en foutez peut-être, McNulty.
Tu vois ?
- Alors, comment ça va ?
- Ça va bien.
Si tu dis que ça va bien...
Alors, c'est connu, pour les braqueurs ?
Oui, on est au courant.
Regarde qui voilà.
Quoi de neuf, mec, tu sais...
que je suis réglo.
J'ai dit qu'il y aura 4 000 $ pour Omar
et 2 000 $ pour chaque jeune,
vu qu'on est une équipe.
Je file 500 $ à celui qui a tout vu,
je te file 500 $ pour avoir passé l'info
et je file 500 $ à Wee-Bey et Bird
pour faire la casse.
- D'accord.
- Tu t'en sors avec le reste ?
Quoi ?
Ils sont tous un peu dégoûtés, non ?
Ouais, pour l'instant, rien de spécial.
J'ai dit vendredi qu'y avait pas de paie,
c'est qu'une bande de mendiants de merde.
Enfin, ils m'ont rien rapporté depuis.
- Fais tourner le biz, cousin !
- Ouais.
Oh ! T'es prêt à te battre.
Continue comme ça, et t'auras ta part.
- D'accord ?
- D'accord.
- Fais tourner le biz.
- C'est clair.
- À plus.
- Vas-y mollo, mais vas-y quand même.
Plus chaud que le Wu-Tang, killer bee.
- 40 cents.
- Non, pas pour 30 cm.
Avec tout le respect que je vous dois,
à ce prix-là, vous pouvez les acheter
chez Monsieur Bricolage.
Ça va vous revenir
à 45 ou 50 cents pour 30 cm.
Pour du cuivre non volé.
D'accord, 35 cents pour 30 cm.
C'est parce que je vous respecte
pour ce que vous faites pour nous,
pour ces logements de qualité.
30 cents, à prendre ou à laisser.
Je comprends votre envie
de boucler ces enquêtes, vraiment.
Mais juger ces meurtres maintenant
et dévoiler nos informations
dans les pièces à conviction...
Je me fie à mon jugement, lieutenant.
Trois meurtres avec la même arme
et Barksdale vu sur les lieux du crime.
Ils sont sur écoute. On commence à récolter
des infos pertinentes.
Si vous les arrêtez trop tôt,
Barksdale va changer de tactique.
- Tout le travail déjà fait...
- Écoutez,
je vais pas vous aider pour votre boulot,
mais moi, je fais le mien.
Major...
je vous demande une faveur.
- Une faveur.
- Oui, monsieur.
Une faveur.
Dans ce cas...
c'est non. Désolé.
- T'es rentré tôt, aujourd'hui.
- Oui, le boulot, c'est chiant.
- On mange avec toi ?
- Pourquoi pas ?
- Tu nous as promis des lasagnes.
- Allons dans le quartier italien.
Prenons des lasagnes chez Sab.
- Tu cuisines jamais.
- Cuisiner, ça aussi c'est chiant.
- Qui est à l'appareil ?
- Je veux le voir.
- Qui ça ?
- Brandon, mon pote.
- La société de plomberie.
- De la bombe.
Mon plan à moi, Bubs.
Johnny avait un plan.
Cassez-vous, connards.
C'est la fête du Visage Pâle.
- Moi aussi, j'ai un plan.
- Ah oui ?
On va attendre
que ce connard de radin merdique
remette ces tuyaux de cuivre
dans les logements qu'il construit.
Et, avant qu'il ne cloisonne tout,
on s'y faufile et on lui rechipe cette merde.
30 cents pour 30 cm.
On va pas se laisser avoir par ce connard,
hein ?
Non.
Ça va ?
Encore une, ce serait bien.
- Oui.
- Une seule.
Johnny l'a.
Je reviens.
Je suis de garde.
Vous trouverez rien parce que j'ai rien fait !
Allez, lâchez-moi.
Un Blanc n'a pas le droit de se promener ?
Ça veut dire quoi ? Allez !
C'est pas juste !
C'est du racisme !
C'est parce que je suis blanc, c'est ça ?
Laissez-moi...
Putain, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Ce mec n'a pas de chance.
D'accord. Les mains en l'air !
- Salut.
- Salut.
Alors, tu vas faire quoi de ton argent ?
Tu sais quoi ?
Prends tout
et va acheter un truc sympa pour ta nana.
T'en as une, non ?
En tout cas,
t'as assez de fric pour t'en trouver une.
Pourquoi t'as rabaissé Sterling comme ça ?
Il en a déjà bien bavé.
- Je l'ai pas rabaissé.
- Pourquoi doit-il juste guetter ?
Cass aussi.
Parce qu'ils piquaient des thunes.
Tous les deux.
Ça les a fait chier que je les paie pas.
Alors Sterling a commencé
à piquer du crack et l'a filé à Cass.
Elle le vendait en à-côté.
Tu l'as pas dit ? À Stinkum ou Bodie ?
Ils ne le savent pas ?
Si je leur dis, qu'est-ce qui va se passer ?
Ils vont niquer Sterling et Cassandra
avec une batte de baseball.
C'est exagéré, non ?
Donc ils ne vendent plus de dope.
Pourquoi tu nous as pas payés ?
C'est pas juste.
Écoute,
Stringer pensait qu'on avait un indic ici.
À cause du vol, d'Omar et du reste.
Il m'a demandé de tous vous rabaisser
quelque temps.
Pour voir qui aurait encore du fric
à la fin du mois.
C'était des indics ?
Sterling et Cass ?
Non, juste des filous.
2-0, Orioles, pour la première manche.
Bon, on va à la criminelle.
Vous deux, vous restez assis, d'accord ?
Ne vous promenez pas.
- Papa ?
- Oui ?
Demain, y a école.
Maman a dit qu'on devait...
Je sais. Tout à l'heure. Restez là.
Les coureurs sur les bases 2 et 3,
aucun batteur retiré dans la 1re manche.
Mora à la batte, le lancer est trop haut.
Lopez au lancer.
En dehors de la zone de strike.
15 lancers dont 10 hors de la zone de strike.
C'est une balle au sol dans le champ droit.
64-Charlie à Central K.
T'es prêt ?
Il faut te venger, Omar.
On n'est pas dans un vrai poste de police ?
On te ressemble un peu, Omar.
Livrés à nous-mêmes,
jouant le jeu à notre façon.
Parfois, c'est pas facile.
Désolée pour ton copain.
Avon est un putain de pervers.
Il avait aussi ses raisons.
Premièrement, vous lui avez piqué sa dope.
Deuxièmement, il te cherche.
Ça explique
toutes ces brûlures de cigarettes.
Les doigts cassés
et les avant-bras fracturés.
Il voulait que ton mec te balance.
Une adresse, une rue.
Il a eu du cran.
Ouais.
Tu ne dois avoir qu'une envie,
c'est de rentrer chez toi
pour prendre ce flingue que t'aimes tant
et partir à la traque.
Tu n'as qu'une idée en tête.
- Tu n'aurais pas tort.
- Non, c'est vrai.
Ça ne suffira pas,
un homme avec deux canons.
Tu peux faire ce que tu veux.
Mais si tu nous refiles des infos
sur Barksdale et sa bande,
ça pourrait lui faire du mal, à lui aussi.
Balance ce que tu peux dire.
Je vais vous dire un truc, d'accord ?
Tout ce que je dois faire, je le fais.
Ça sert à rien que vous vous en mêliez,
vu ce que je ressens, aujourd'hui...
Vous avez besoin de quoi ?
Quand as-tu vu Brandon
pour la dernière fois ?
Mardi, vers 19 h. Ou plus tard.
Il allait en ville
et chez le Grec après.
Tout le monde dit
qu'il s'est fait kidnapper là-bas.
Le Grec sur la rue Baltimore ?
Oui, il adorait jouer au flipper.
Il était seul ?
Oui, et ça m'a pas plu.
Si on prend trop longtemps un jeune mec
pour un gamin, il se casse.
Lorsque Bailey a été tué,
tu savais que Barksdale allait venir te voir,
non ?
Bailey ? Arrêtez.
Il pouvait même plus compter ses ennemis.
J'ai cru qu'il était allé
dans le mauvais coin et s'était fait tuer.
Mais tu te souciais de Brandon, non ?
Dans mon taf,
on prend un jeune
et on essaie de rester discret.
Mais on peut pas toujours se cacher.
Compris ?
Sérieux, si tu le fais
aussi longtemps que moi,
tu te fies à ta réputation.
Ceux qui veulent te faire du mal
vont s'en prendre plein la gueule.
C'est clair.
Qui a fait du mal à Brandon ?
Ça pourrait être Wee-Bey...
son pote Stinkum
et Bird.
Lui aussi a fait le kidnapping.
Qu'est-ce que tu peux
nous dire sur le boulot ?
À 19 h 56, mardi soir, on a un appel reçu
pour D'Angelo Barksdale,
avec un numéro de cabine à rappeler.
Un numéro du Westside.
Le numéro est encodé, d'accord ?
Trois minutes après, on reçoit
un autre appel de la cité vers ce numéro.
30 secondes après,
on reçoit un autre appel de la cité
pour le pager de Stringer Bell.
Incroyable.
Enfin, un autre appel.
Sûrement à partir d'une cabine.
Stringer Bell qui rappelle.
Ça sonne dans la cour de la cité.
45 minutes plus tard, un autre appel.
Provenant de la même cabine
qui a appelé le pager de D'Angelo
pour mettre le feu aux poudres.
Tu comprends ?
Voilà notre meurtre, ici.
Ce premier numéro, envoyé à D'Angelo,
je pense qu'il provient d'une cabine
près du Grec.
C'est de votre faute.
En mettant les cabines sur écoute
mardi soir,
on aurait chopé le tueur.
On serait arrivés avant.
On a tout enregistré.
Celui-là appelle celui-ci, et celui-là rappelle.
Si on met ces cabines sur écoute
au bon moment, on le chope.
Mais on peut pas retourner en arrière.
Dans cette enquête, on n'est jamais
là où il faut.
Sale temps pour vous ?
Il s'est battu, mais vous l'avez arrêté.
Vous l'avez vu se faire arrêter ?
- Mardi ?
- Oui, mardi.
Par la police ?
Il s'est fait arrêter par la police ?
Les flics lui ont passé les menottes ?
Et ces gars ?
Ils y étaient aussi ?
Non.
- Il s'est battu, vous l'avez arrêté.
- Bien.
Merci beaucoup, monsieur.
Ça coïncide.
Non.
J'ai besoin d'aide. Rawls est mon supérieur.
Lieutenant, réfléchissez un peu.
Vous allez mettre Bill Rawls en colère...
Ie mec le plus impitoyable
qu'on ait dans ce service ?
Pour quoi faire ?
Pour défendre une affaire
dont même le préfet adjoint se fout.
Non.
Je tiens à mon boulot, merci.
Dans le cimetière, tu nous as dit qu'un gars
nommé Bird avait tué le mec qui bosse.
Oui, le mec qui a témoigné.
William Gant. D'accord.
C'est Bird qui l'a fait, c'est sûr.
- Comment tu le sais ?
- Tout le monde le sait.
Ce renoi a suivi le mec
et lui a tiré dans la tête.
Tout le beau monde de la cité a vu ça.
Et Bird bossait pour Avon ?
C'était un de ses tueurs.
Il aimait utiliser son nouveau flingue.
Un .380 d'Autriche ou d'Australie.
Ou un truc du genre.
Mais je sais qu'il adorait ce flingue.
Un .380.
Oui, c'est ça.
Chopez-le, et vous aurez l'arme.
Parce qu'il est trop con
pour jeter ce genre de flingue.
- L'arme ne suffit pas.
- Ah bon ?
Il dira avoir acheté l'arme dans la rue
après le meurtre de Gant.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il vous faut ?
- Un témoin oculaire.
Pour corroborer ce que tu dis.
- D'accord.
- Quoi d'accord ?
- Je témoigne.
- Tu as vu le meurtre ?
Oui.
Tu peux identifier ce mec, Bird,
comme étant le meurtrier de William Gant ?
Et tu n'as pas peur d'aller au tribunal
pour témoigner contre un mec
de la bande de Barksdale ?
Omar n'a pas peur.
Pendant que le lieutenant Daniels
et sa bande sont perdus dans le high-tech,
jouant avec des pagers, des cabines
et des micros portatifs,
mes gars ont fait le lien
entre Barksdale et trois meurtres.
- D'Angelo Barksdale, pas Avon.
- D'Angelo pour Avon.
La victime, selon nos témoins,
fréquentait Avon Barksdale.
Monsieur, nous développons...
Rien n'est clair.
J'inculpe pour trois meurtres.
Si vous inculpez, mon enquête est finie.
Ces preuves ne tiendront pas en cour.
Vous le savez.
Alors on ramène Barksdale,
on le menace, et on consolide notre affaire.
Il a déjà été jugé deux fois.
Il va être encore mieux préparé.
Alors on cherche de nouveaux témoins.
Cette affaire va être deux fois plus solide
le jour du procès.
On a une accusation,
on utilise le petit Barksdale
pour avoir le grand Barksdale,
puis on rentre chez soi
en bons vieux flics
pour boire de la Budweiser.
Des foutaises !
C'est McNulty
qui a identifié les balles pour ces meurtres
et il m'a dit de lutter pour ça.
Il sait que vos poursuites sont injustifiées,
vous et moi, on le sait.
Ça suffit.
Je n'aime pas votre système d'écoute,
lieutenant.
Chaque jour, je dépasse de 2 000 $
Ie budget de la cellule
pour engager du personnel.
Ie budget de la cellule
pour engager du personnel.
Le major Rawls nous donne une chance
de mettre la pression sur Barksdale
en l'accusant de meurtre.
Qu'est-ce qui nous retient ?
Si le major Rawls a raison,
il aura toujours raison d'ici un mois.
Si les écoutes ne sont pas
compromettantes, il fera ses accusations.
On n'y perd rien.
Par contre, s'il a tort,
s'il ne peut être condamné
ou si Barksdale ne file pas de preuves,
alors il sera trop tard.
Avon Barksdale changera de tactique,
et les écoutes seront foutues.
Et là, nous n'aurons absolument rien à dire,
ni moi, ni vous, ni Rawls,
pour convaincre le juge.
Vous vouliez me voir, major ?
Si McNulty mêle sa vie privée au boulot,
je veux le savoir.
Que ce soit pour un rapport falsifié,
ou pour un truc illégal.
Major, c'est un connard,
mais il ne fait que bosser.
Cette enquête lui tient vraiment à coeur.
Aucune faute ?
Il ne boit plus ?
Il ne boit pas au boulot ?
Il ne boit pas au volant, inspecteur ?
- Major...
- J'ai besoin de votre aide, Michael.
Les mandats d'arrêt vont attendre.
Le préfet nous a accordé un mois de plus.
Et celui que vous avez interrogé aujourd'hui
a déclaré avoir vu le meurtre de Gant.
Qui ça ? Omar ?
Greggs m'a dit
qu'elle prendra sa déposition demain.
Lieutenant...
merci.
Ça vous a coûté cher ?
Le clown de la céti a tout bicrave, mec.
À donfe.
Mais on rempile demain
- avec du matos du Nord.
- Pas de problème.
- Pas de problème ?
- Des dealers parlent d'un mec
du nom de Lohman pour qui c'est grave,
- qui doit être malade.
- Et la fin ?
La fin, c'est sur une histoire de piles,
une livraison, je crois.
- De piles ?
- Je pige le charabia de Perkins
et celui des tours Latrobe,
mais je maîtrise pas encore bien
Ia cité Franklin.
Il dit qu'ils ont tout vendu dans la cité,
et que demain ils repartent
avec un nouvel arrivage.
- T'entends ça ?
- Repasse-le.
- Le clown de la céti a tout bicrave, mec.
- Le dealer de la cité.
- À donfe.
- A tout vendu.
Mais on rempile demain
avec du matos du Nord.
Demain, il repart avec le dernier arrivage.
Comment tu fais pour piger si bien ?
"Esclaves de Côte d'Or
partis vers les champs de coton
"vendus sur un marché
de la Nouvelle-Orléans."
C'est quoi, ça ?
Les Rolling Stones.
Les deux premiers vers de Brown Sugar.
Je parie que tu l'as entendue 500 fois
sans jamais t'en rendre compte.
Je me collais aux baffles
et j'écoutais ce disque en boucle.
Ça explique plein de trucs.
- Alors attends le renoi, vu ?
- C'est quoi "attends le renoi" ?
Même moi, j'ai entendu ça.
Le renoi est un code pour Stinkum.
On a trouvé ça en écoutant son pager.
Ils vont en faire circuler pour 40 000 $
dans la cour de la cité.
Stinkum s'occupe de la livraison
et arrive vers midi.
T'es sûr de tout ça ?
Retourne-le.
Quatre pour 40 000 $,
une barre par tranche de 10 000,
"LO" pour la cité,
- 1 2 pour l'heure.
- "S" pour Stinkum.
- T'as mis combien de temps pour piger ça ?
- Quatre à cinq heures.
Tu restes là à regarder des messages
de pager pendant cinq heures ?
Je sais pas,
ça m'amuse de décoder leur bordel.

"L'homme doit avoir un code." -- Bunk
Tu ne m'aides pas, Sanny.
- Major, je...
- Je te demande un seul truc, putain...
- Je sais, mais...
- Je te soutiens pendant des mois.
Et je vois les affaires s'accumuler
une à une, pas vrai ?
Elles sont toutes à toi,
toutes en cours, Sanny.
L'an dernier, ton taux de classement
était de 40 %. Cette année, encore moins.
J'en ai des dures.
Y a pas beaucoup de cadeaux là-dedans.
Mike, tu es doué pour les cadeaux.
Je te l'accorde.
Merde, les cadeaux,
t'en élucides six, sept sur dix.
- Mais un cas de "qui ça peut être putain" ?
- C'est injuste.
Injuste ? Qu'est-ce qui est juste, putain ?
J'ai un inspecteur livré à lui-même
qui dirige son équipe spéciale
et qui me démolit dès qu'il le peut.
Mon boulot n'est pas de baiser un autre flic.
C'est pas ton boulot ?
Je vais te dire un truc.
Je vais être super juste,
je te donne le choix.
Soit tu m'apportes des preuves
contre McNulty, soit tu fais ton boulot.
- Prends n'importe quelle affaire.
- Major...
Choisis un meurtre, élucide-le,
ou amène-moi McNulty sur un plateau,
c'est tout.
Stinkum sera avec un coursier.
C'est le coursier qui aura le paquet.
- Quand tu les as, suis-les.
- Pour qu'il nous voie ?
Oui. Mets ton gyrophare, si tu veux.
Le coursier va détaler.
- Je prends le coursier, et toi, Stinkum.
- Non.
- Je prends le coursier, lui, Stink ?
- Non.
Vous le prenez tous les deux.
- Et Stink se barre ?
- Personne ne se barre.
Si on arrête Stink maintenant,
il faut prouver nos soupçons.
Ce qui signifie l'arrêt des écoutes.
On n'a pas fait tout ça
pour deux jours de poudre, non ?
On embarque le coursier, on l'accroche
et on retourne pêcher.
Entre les écoutes
et le coursier qui détale de la voiture,
on a de quoi coffrer Stinkum quand on veut.
On revoit aussi les vieilles affaires
de meurtres, avec de nouveaux témoins.
Il y a des avoirs à bloquer,
des couvertures pour l'argent de la drogue.
- Comme quoi ?
- Un club de strip-tease,
deux lavomatiques,
une entreprise de remorquage,
des pompes funèbres.
- Des pompes funèbres ?
- Il en a acheté à Gwynn Falls l'an dernier.
L'argent va partout.
On le sait d'une des nanas d'Avon
qui s'en est vantée à une amie.
Dieu sait ce qu'il a d'autre
dont on ne sait rien.
Le nom de Barksdale n'apparaît jamais.
Il est toujours indirectement lié.
Le nom de Barksdale n'apparaît jamais.
Il est toujours indirectement lié.
L'affaire d'une carrière, Votre Honneur.
Écoute, Jimmy.
Tu as mal écrit "coupable",
et tu mélanges "alors" et "or".
A-L-O-R-S est un adverbe
qui mesure le temps ou la cause.
"L'inspecteur McNulty fiche le bazar,
"alors il doit tout arranger."
C'est très bien de lire chaque mot...
Qu'on ne peut confondre avec O-R,
habituellement utilisé
pour contraster deux propositions :
"Rhonda est intelligente
or Jimmy ne l'a pas compris."
Vu ? Il y a suffisamment de progression
pour justifier la continuation des écoutes.
Je signe une autorisation pour un mois
de plus de surveillance téléphonique.
Une copie à la cour, une au procureur ?
- Il vous faut autre chose ?
- Quoi, de toi ?
Je vais aller voir un homme
au sujet d'un chien.
Le plaisir est pour moi, Mlle Pearlman.
Votre professionnalisme
et l'ensemble de vos compétences
contrastent grandement
avec la municipalité et son atmosphère
de médiocrité et d'indifférence.
- Vous êtes ironique ?
- Non.
Encore dix ans de ces conneries
et je vous vois porter la robe
à la cour de Baltimore.
Ou la camisole de force.
Bon sang.
Je la baiserais bien.
Les cheveux roux, les taches de rousseur...
Pas toi ?
Comme pour tout ce qui passe à la cour,
je suis de même avis que le juge.
Allez, Jimmy.
Assieds-toi. Parle-moi.
- 1 2-14.
- Quoi de neuf ?
Preston, direction est.
Stinkum et un jeune passager.
Ils sont au feu rouge.
Je les ai.
Voyons ce qu'il en dit.
Putain de merde.
Il va sortir d'une minute à l'autre.
- Les keufs !
- Il a sauté à Druid Hill, bloc 700,
porte un jogging gris
et se dirige en courant vers la cour.
Putain.
On arrête les deals. V'là les keufs.
- Allez, petit. Fonce.
- Il est trop petit pour toi.
Le matos !
Bonjour, M. I'agent.
Fonce, mec !
Vas-y, fonce, le keublan se traîne !
Putain, bouge-toi, c'est mon matos !
- Merde.
- Il revient !
- Laisse tomber, mec !
- Arrête-le, arrête-le !
Attrape-le !
- J'ai le sac !
- Il va à droite.
- Prends le sac.
- Bouge-toi, mec !
Alors ?
Putain, le salaud.
Je parie que vous faites pas ça
aux keublans.
Foutez-lui la paix. Il a rien fait à personne.
Quatre paquets. Prêts à la vente.
- 1 2-08.
- 12-08.
On a besoin d'un panier à salade
au bloc 800 de Lex,
- dans la cour.
- Compris, 12-08.
Quelqu'un a une clope ?
Comment ça va, avec tes patrons ?
Rawls a voulu arrêter l'enquête
la semaine dernière.
Stopper les écoutes
pour des meurtres à la con.
- Qui l'a empêché de le faire ?
- Daniels.
- Daniels ?
- J'y croyais pas non plus.
J'étais prêt à rendre mon tablier,
et Daniels s'est pointé.
Ah oui ? Pourquoi t'es pas venu me voir ?
Tu ne me fais plus confiance, Jimmy ?
Qui a vendu la mèche à un journaliste,
Votre Honneur ?
D'où tu sors ?
Il faut 35 cents maintenant
pour avoir une tonalité.
Non, 50.
Il me reste une semaine
avant de repasser de nuit.
Si je ne retourne pas avec eux,
Rawls me vire.
Tu sais où me trouver.
Au pire, Pearlman va voir ses patrons.
Le bureau du procureur
t'apprécie encore, Jimmy.
Les gens qui disent m'apprécier
commencent à m'inquiéter davantage
que ceux qui ne m'aiment pas.
Russell Bell - ALIAS = "Stringer"
Maintenant ?
Ouais.
Quelqu'un appelle le pager de Stringer
du téléphone N°2
de la cour des tours.
- En ce moment ?
- Oui.
Ça roule ?
- Freamon.
- J'ai repéré Stinkum.
- Les keufs en ont chopé quatre.
- Quoi ?
- Ils en ont chopé quatre.
- Pourquoi tu me dis ça, putain ?
À plus.
Il croit que je peux pondre ça comme ça ?
Tu peux pas sortir
tant que t'as pas fini tes devoirs ?
Je peux rien avant de classer
cette affaire pour Rawls.
Ça date de quand ?
Un sacré bail.
C'était une affaire à toi ?
Alors tu l'as deux fois dans le cul.
L'enculé !
Le fils de pute !
Donne-moi la carte.
- T'es vraiment dégueulasse.
- Allez, donne-la-moi.
C'était une gitane
C'était une gitane
- Madame Laurie ?
- T'es con ou quoi ?
Putain, Jay, Madame LaRue ?
D'autres hommes ont fait appel à cette dame
Iorsqu'ils étaient dans l'impasse.
Tu veux rire.
Je ne rigole pas quand il s'agit
de Madame LaRue.
Cette femme a un don inexplicable
pour les enquêtes de meurtres.
Au-delà de tout raisonnement logique.
Appelle-la.
Il est tombé là,
donc la poubelle le masquait de ce côté.
Mais par là,
tout le monde était au premier rang.
Jouer les boy-scouts sera peut-être payant.
Vous avez besoin d'aide, madame ?
- Ça va.
- Je vous en prie.
Que je comprenne bien.
Un Noir et un Blanc
qui se baladent dans la cité
en costard cravate pour aider
les vieilles dames avec leurs courses,
et autres.
La police, pas vrai ?
Je le crains, madame.
C'est au sujet du meurtre de l'autre jour ?
Le concierge ?
Faites asseoir les accusés.
- Le juge va arriver.
- Je peux prendre le dossier ?
- Tiens.
- Merci.
Madame, excusez-moi ?
- Inspecteur ?
- J'ai besoin d'en garder un.
Lequel ?
Voyons. Came, coke, came, vol, came,
délit d'intention, tentative de vol, came,
came, vol, came, et l'accusation du jour,
c'est possession de cocaïne.
- Mais t'as besoin de lui ?
- Oui.
On le fait basculer
devant le tribunal de toxicomanie,
il plaide coupable
et sort en liberté conditionnelle
avec désintox obligatoire.
- C'est tout ?
- C'est tout.
D'accord.
Je suis avec ton pote Bubs.
- Tu veux sortir, non ?
- Ouais.
Plaide coupable pour la possession
et persuade le juge
que tu veux te désintoxiquer.
- Le tribunal de toxico ?
- Deviens clean,
assiste à des réunions
et pisse quand on te le demande.
- Pas de taule ?
- Non.
- Je sors tout de suite ?
- Après la paperasse.
D'accord.
La victime arrivait par là
et un autre type marchait derrière lui.
Il a dû lui dire un truc
car il s'est retourné avant d'être abattu.
- Connaissez-vous l'auteur ?
- Non.
- Il était comment ?
- Qui ça ?
- Le méchant.
- La peau claire, taille moyenne.
Plutôt maigre.
- Jeune ou vieux ?
- Il était pas jeune.
Mon collègue fait la victime
et je suis l'homme armé...
- À cette distance ?
- Non.
Comme ça ?
À peu près comme ça.
- Croyez-vous qu'en le revoyant...
- Je n'ai pas...
Madame, ne craignez rien.
D'où j'étais assise, il me tournait le dos.
C'est rien, vous avez bien fait.
Si vous avez des ennuis, appelez-nous.
- Elle peut pas l'identifier.
- Mon type, Omar, si.
Un voleur avec douze condamnations.
C'est ça, ton témoin oculaire ?
Elle raconte la même chose,
jusqu'à la distance de tir.
Omar dit aussi que si on coffre Bird,
on aura l'arme.
Il est trop con pour l'avoir jetée.
Donc entre elle et Omar,
il suffit que l'arme corresponde.
C'est arrivé comme t'as dit,
comme si c'était prévu.
C'était prévu.
Quelle est ton adresse ?
734 Fayette.
734 Fayette.
Quel appartement ?
Quel appartement, petit ?
Allez, petit, quel appartement ?
- 1 1-M.
- Bon, 1 1-M. C'était si dur que ça ?
Ta date de naissance ?
Allez, petit.
Quoi ?
C'est lui.
Qui ?
Kevin Johnson ?
T'as faim ? Jambon fromage ? Thon ?
Un Mars. Aux noisettes.
Une boisson ?
Une canette de thé.
C'est bon.
Va au distributeur.
Ramène un Mars et une canette de Lipton.
Le connard ne me regarde même pas.
- Et si on recommençait tout ?
- Recommencer ?
Mon avocat dit
que j'ai de quoi porter plainte.
Avocat, mon cul. Je te parle de la vie, Kevin.
Ce jeu-là t'a déjà coûté cher, non ?
Plus qu'il n'aurait dû, je le sais.
À qui la faute ?
La sienne. La nôtre.
La mienne, peut-être.
J'ai le sentiment de te devoir quelque chose.
Alors je te demande ce que tu comptes faire.
Tu veux en sortir ?
Tu veux faire autre chose de ta vie ?
Viens me voir.
Y avait plus de thé.
Peut-être demain, peut-être plus tard.
Quand tu seras prêt pour autre chose,
appelle-moi.
Je me souviendrai de toi.
Ce connard s'imagine
qu'il peut m'acheter avec un bonbon.
C'est peut-être lié à la drogue
ou juste un vol.
- Vous êtes irlandais, non ?
- Italien.
- Santangelo ?
- Santangelo.
Saint Angelo.
Jeune martyr, saint patron de Licata,
en ltalie.
Il a prié pour ses tueurs,
le couteau encore dans la plaie.
Mais ce n'est pas Saint Angelo qui appelle.
C'est Saint Antoine qui veut vous aider.
Ah oui ?
Beaucoup.
C'est pas lui qu'on appelle
quand on perd un truc ?
Vous êtes sûre, c'est Antoine ?
Allez sur la tombe de la victime,
enterrez la statue,
attendez une heure, sans tricher.
Déterrez-la. Rentrez chez vous.
Mettez-la à votre oreille en vous couchant.
Et il me dira le nom du meurtrier ?
C'était à moi de choisir.
Oui, mon tour.
Tu m'as traîné au B&O l'autre soir.
Après que tu m'as traîné au Sugar Hill,
souviens-toi.
Non.
Hé, Turk.
Où est Nadine ce soir ?
Gainesville. Elle est en Floride
chez sa soeur toute la semaine.
C'est dommage, mais le manque de chatte
affecte le comportement d'un homme bien.
La mignonne.
Marla.
Ravie. Vous vous souvenez
de mon mari, Cedric ?
Oui. Enchantée.
Marla est avec moi au comité
de réhabilitation du centre de Baltimore.
C'est elle qui me tient éveillée aux réunions.
C'était horrible.
Tout le monde piquait du nez.
- La dernière était si longue...
- Pardonnez-moi.
La meilleure campagne depuis des années.
500 $ la place pour un lieutenant de police ?
Même dans cette ville,
c'est un traitement bien cruel.
Quelle est la personne
qui vous a tant motivé ?
Le maire ? Le président du conseil ?
- L'officier d'état civil, peut-être ?
- Je reconnaîtrais peut-être le maire.
Pour les autres,
il me faudrait des photos de la maison.
Vous n'avez pas tort, lieutenant.
Dans cet État, la limite est floue
entre les affiches de campagne
et les photos des prévenus.
Interro surprise.
Conseiller municipal ? De l'est, peut-être ?
Sénateur de l'État.
Clay Davis, du 39e district.
Vice-président du budget.
Vous ne serez jamais major à ce compte-là.
Pardonnez-moi, je dois faire mon devoir
et lécher l'arrière-train sénatorial.
Clay, ravi de vous revoir.
Allez, cassons-nous.
Vous ne signez pas.
Ramène-le après la réunion.
Si tu ne restes pas, on ne signe pas.
C'est comme ça que ça marche.
Viens, je veux voir le spectacle.
Bubs.
10 : on continue notre inventaire personnel
et quand on se trompe,
on l'admet tout de suite.
1 1 : à travers la prière et la méditation,
on améliore notre contact conscient
avec Dieu et on Le comprend...
Y a des visages que j'ai pas vus
depuis un bail, je les croyais morts.
C'est tout comme, non ?
Ayant eu ce réveil spirituel
à la suite de ces mesures,
on tente de passer le message
aux autres toxicos
et d'appliquer ces principes
dans tous les domaines.
L'orateur d'aujourd'hui est Waylon,
que ceux qui viennent à nos réunions
connaissent bien.
Vous savez tous que je suis Waylon,
un toxico.
Salut, Waylon.
Le fait est qu'aujourd'hui,
j'ai plus envie d'être clean que défoncé.
Je sais que c'est bien.
Ça fait du bien d'être là.
D'être n'importe où, clean.
Même à Baltimore.
Je suis clean depuis 24 heures et je suis sûr
que ma maladie veut me tuer.
Je suis là, avec vous tous, à dire
des conneries sur ma force, mes sentiments,
mais ma maladie est sur le parking.
Elle se prépare
et attend de me botter le cul
et de me remettre à la rue.
J'ai des cicatrices sur les mains, les pieds,
deux alertes d'endocardite...
L'hépatite C ou je ne sais quoi
qui me bousille le foie.
J'ai perdu une bonne épouse,
une mauvaise petite amie,
et le respect de tous ceux
qui ont voulu me prêter de l'argent
ou me rendre service.
J'ai vendu ma camionnette, ma moto,
ma guitare National Steel
et la collection de timbres
que mon grand-père m'a laissée.
Au bout du rouleau,
quand je me suis retrouvé à la rue,
sans un pot pour pisser dedans,
et tous ceux qui m'ont jamais aimé
maudissant mon nom,
vous savez ce que je me suis dit ?
"Waylon, tu t'en sors bien."
Eh oui.
Je croyais être le toxico de Dieu.
Et que si Dieu n'avait pas voulu
que je me défonce,
il n'aurait pas rendu la défonce
si proche de la perfection.
Je pourrais encore me défoncer une fois,
mais je doute sérieusement
pouvoir m'en remettre.
Alors si l'un de vous
se sent près de toucher le fond,
je suis là pour discuter.
Je me fiche de qui vous êtes,
de ce que vous avez fait,
ou à qui vous l'avez fait.
Vous êtes ici,
et moi aussi.
Oui.
Le groupe des Drogués Anonymes
donne un porte-clés
pour les périodes d'abstinence.
Alors si vous en avez gagné un,
venez le chercher.
Quelqu'un en est-il à neuf mois ?
Six mois ?
- Trois mois ?
- Ouais.
Un mois ?
Et maintenant,
pour le plus important parmi nous,
quelqu'un en est-il à 24 heures
ou a un désir sincère de vivre ?
Ouais.
On s'est shootés ce matin.
"Mon Dieu, donne-moi la sérénité
"d'accepter les choses
que je ne puis changer,
"le courage de changer celles que je peux,
"et la sagesse d'en connaître la différence."
On en est où ?
4 à 3 pour les Orioles.
Williams vient de rallier la 2e base.
Ils laissent toujours les Yankees remonter.
Non, ils ont une bonne équipe cette année.
- Qui lance ?
- Buddy Groom.
Tu es avec qui ?
Marla Daniels.
Je cambriolerais bien cette maison.
Ah oui ?
Ça vaudrait le coup.
Et l'alarme ?
Je brancherais cette connerie sur elle-même,
je foncerais dans les portes-fenêtres
avec le camion.
- Ça marcherait.
- Tu l'as dit.
Je revendrais la plupart des objets par ici,
mais pour tous les trucs d'art,
faudrait aller sur New York.
Je m'appelle Damien Price.
Mais on m'appelle plutôt Day-Day.
Cedric Daniels.
Mais on m'appelle plutôt Lieutenant.
Regarde, ils font entrer Roberts.
Te voilà.
Je voudrais te présenter quelqu'un.
- Allez.
- Ouais.
- Enlève tout.
- Frotte-les bien comme ça.
Alors, enfoiré.
Faut que tu charges Bird avec le cas Gant
et faut faire quelque chose
de cette autre affaire,
Ia jeune fille.
Diedre Kresson.
Faut que tu foutes les deux meurtres
sur son dos
et t'amènes ça à Rawls.
Tu vois, Jimmy,
Ie plus difficile,
pour un connard de ton espèce,
c'est de lui en faire carrément cadeau.
Et faudra peut-être encore lui lécher le cul
pendant trois ou quatre mois, putain.
Va falloir que tu t'y colles.
Trois ou quatre mois ?
Il le faut, Jimmy.
Trop tard pour faire autre chose, putain.
Tu vas faire le Blanc lèche-cul.
Tu sais pourquoi
je te respecte autant, Bunk ?
C'est pas parce que t'es un bon flic.
Parce que ça, on s'en branle, hein ?
On s'en branle, ouais.
C'est pas parce que quand je suis arrivé
à la Crim, tu m'as appris des trucs cool.
Non, je sais pas.
Je sais pas.
C'est parce que
quand il a fallu que tu me baises,
t'as été très doux.
Tu l'as dit.
T'aurais pu me traîner hors du garage
et me baiser sur le capot d'une bagnole.
Mais non, t'as été très doux.
Je savais que c'était ta première fois.
Je voulais que ce soit particulier.
Ça l'a été, mec.
Putain, ça l'a été.
- Ramasse ton putain de fric.
- Non, c'est pour moi.
Ramasse-le, vieille pute.
Turk.
Je peux en avoir un autre ?
Chez Orlando - Club pour Messieurs
Ça gaze ?
- Ils sont là-haut ?
- Ouais.
Hé, Dee.
Quand t'as une minute, j'ai un truc à te dire.
J'ai un plan à te proposer.
Alors viens me voir, d'accord ?
Ouais. Pas de blème.
J'ai appelé Bell uniquement
parce que ces renois...
T'es pas censé parler au téléphone
et tu le sais.
Quoi de neuf, mon frère ?
Qui balance ?
- Personne.
- T'es sûr de ça, mec ?
T'as été chopé pour le casse,
ils font une descente.
- Maintenant, ils suivent Stink.
- Mon gang est réglo.
Pigé ?
Personne n'a du blé en plus.
J'ai tout vérifié.
Peut-être que t'as grillé un stop
ou que t'avais un phare de niqué...
Je grille un stop avec 40 000 $ ?
- Tu déconnes.
- J'en sais rien.
Y a un truc.
Vas-y aujourd'hui,
dis à la caillera qui bosse pour toi
que les choses vont changer.
Stringer va y aller et t'expliquer ça.
Tant que cette merde est pas réglée,
la téci dort.
Pourquoi ils ont pas buté Stink ?
Les Stups ont chopé le petit avec la dope
et ont eu Stink grâce à ses plaques.
T'es allé voir les flics pour porter plainte ?
J'ai balancé la caisse à Cold Spring Lane.
T'as pas encore de nouvelles des Stups ?
- Non.
- Putain, c'est quoi ce bordel ?
Ils chopent quatre paquets de la caisse.
Ils prennent même pas le numéro ?
C'est quoi ce cirque ?
Y a un truc, mec.
Y a vraiment un truc.
J'ai un truc à faire.
Raconte un truc à Daniels, tu veux ?
Connard.
Herc, Carver.
- Quoi ?
- Quoi ?
Venez là.
Venez.
C'est des bouffons, ceux-là.
Des connards
qui chopent un paquet comme ça.
De qui tu causes ?
Le renoi maigrichon et le stup de mes deux.
Le keublan à la casquette.
- Ceux qu'ont chopé Bodie ?
- Batman et Robin.
Pas mal ?
- Boum.
- Tu les as eus.
- Je suis Batman.
- Ça m'étonnerait.
- Batman est blanc.
- Et Robin est noir ?
T'as entendu le mec,
t'es le keublan de mes deux.
Boy Wonder, tu peux me sucer, vu ?
Arrête tes conneries.
Tu veux signer ça pour moi,
M. Clean du jour ?
Que Dieu te bénisse
quand ils te feront pisser.
Le dieu de ma compréhension ?
Non, on va te trouver de la pisse propre,
que tu pourras emmener au juge.
Hé, Bubs.
Tu connais quelqu'un qui pisse propre toi ?
- Vous êtes prêts pour l'accusation ?
- Si on a du bol avec le flingue, ouais.
Et puis on chope Bird.
Si on le chope avec le flingue,
ça va au F.B.I.
Cinq ans minimum et il a des antécédents,
ce sera beaucoup plus.
On a une adresse où descendre ?
On bosse avec les indics.
Dès qu'on a un truc, on bouge.
... chaud dans l'après-midi,
partiellement ensoleillé, doux,
du vent, possibilité d'orages,
maximales autour de 28°C et pour vendredi,
éclaircie et vent, température de 21°C.
La météo 24 h sur 24 sur W. T.O.P.
Ici Dave Lew,
météorologue de la chaîne Météo.
Vous écoutez W. T.O.P.
T'as peur d'être vu ?
Si ça pose problème à un keum
que je traîne avec vous,
je lui colle mon flingue dans la gueule.
Ça roule ?
Bird n'est pas là aujourd'hui.
Si on avait autre chose qu'un nom de rue,
on trouverait peut-être une adresse.
Qu'est-ce que j'y peux ? lci, Bird, c'est Bird.
Alors vous voulez le choper ici ?
C'est ce qu'on veut.
Il a pas de flingue ici. Personne.
C'est la règle.
Si vous voulez du métal, faut aller voir
un des mioches dans les tours.
- Il nous faut l'arme.
- Alors y a un blème.
On sait pas où il crèche, alors y a un blème.
Pas si vous savez où Bird va se défoncer.
- Bird se came ?
- Pas dans les tours.
Avon n'autorise pas la came à ses mecs.
Autre règle.
"Ne jamais se camer avec sa propre dope."
Si je chassais Bird,
je parierais qu'y a des chances
de le trouver au Dilly,
Ià-bas, à Carrollton.
Si j'étais flic comme vous.
Carrollton ?
Autre truc, quand vous voudrez le choper,
faudra être plus...
prudents.
Pourquoi ça ?
Bird tirera sans réfléchir, c'est sûr.
Poot.
Il est où, Wallace ?
J'en sais rien.
Par là.
Wallace est déchiré.
Depuis qu'ils ont chopé le petit du vol.
Le mettre sur la caisse comme ça.
Wallace dit plus rien, tout ça.
Il sort même pas de sa chambre, des fois.
Je cherche Dee. Tu l'as vu ?
Dee.
Tu glandes ?
Ça roule ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu fous dans la téci ?
- J'ai un truc, mec.
Un truc bien.
Viens par là.
Où est la came ?
Pas aujourd'hui.
C'est le truc, tu vois. Si t'as besoin de plus,
j'ai un contact.
Ah ouais ?
Un keum du club, de Washington.
Il a son matos par la Nouvelle-Orléans,
des Jamaïcos.
La Nouvelle-Orléans ?
Ils proposent pas mal, Dee.
- Mon oncle est au courant ?
- Non.
Pour moi, c'est un truc en plus,
j'ai assez pour me démerder à New York,
mais j'ai pas
le réseau de distribution que t'as ici.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
En gros, Dee,
je prends tous les risques avec eux.
Une fois que j'ai le matos,
je te l'amène et tu l'écoules.
On partage fifty-fifty.
Ça marche ?
Je vais y penser, d'accord ?
On aurait enfin un peu de blé. Tu me suis ?
Ouais.
Ouais, sûr.
Je file.
- Sois cool.
- Réfléchis.
Chapeaux à 5 $. La belle, 5 $.
Chapeaux à 5 $. La belle, 5 $.
Eh oui, 5 $. Venez tous, 5 $ le chapeau.
On surveille quelle porte, déjà ?
L'appart libre. À côté du magasin.
C'est là qu'ils se défoncent.
Il y est toujours ?
Greggs est derrière et on est devant,
alors dis-moi.
Ouais.
Le chapeau à 5 $. La belle, 5 $.
Viens me voir.
Couvre ta tête. Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
On fait pas mieux, hein ?
Le chapeau à 5 $. Viens me voir.
- Le chapeau, 5 $.
- Ta gueule.
Allez-y.
Hé, le nain !
Les mains derrière le dos.
Je l'ai.
Lâche-moi, mec.
Lâchez-moi, putain.
- J'ai les pieds.
- Connards de flics !
Voilà.
Regardez-moi ça.
Chéri.
Lâchez-moi, putain.
Ma main.
- Salope.
- La ferme !
C'est serré, putain.
On laisse le canapé là, non ?
- Ouais, laissez-le là.
- C'est cool. Classe.
Alors ?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe, String ?
- Tu bouges le matos souvent ?
- Tous les soirs depuis la descente.
- Tes gars se défoncent pas ?
- Non. Juste ceux qui annoncent la couleur.
Ils touchent ni le fric ni la dope.
Vous surveillez les apparts libres ?
Vous vous assurez
que les Stups s'installent pas là ?
Ouais.
Pas de portables,
pas de téléphones perso, hein ?
Non, juste les pagers
et les téléphones publics, c'est tout.
Bon, arrachez-moi ces saloperies.
Quoi ?
Arrachez les téléphones.
À partir de maintenant, pour téléphoner,
on change de rue,
et on n'appelle pas du même téléphone
plus d'une fois.
Compris ?
- C'est compris, hein ?
- Oui.
- Bon. Bey, arrache ces saloperies.
- Viens, mec.
Viens. Raccroche le téléphone.
Téléphone public - SERVICE INTERROMPU
Donc on voulait accrocher
Ie tableau
avec la Lexus et les pitbulls,
mais il est toujours au pressing.
Non, sérieux, on voulait montrer aux jurés
que t'as quitté notre interrogatoire
sans autre marque
que celles que t'avais en entrant.
Ta gueule, gros lard.
"Ta gueule, gros lard."
Je croyais qu'on était potes.
Le flingue est en bas, au labo.
S'il revient et qu'il correspond
à l'arme du crime, c'est la peine de mort.
- Ça te branche ?
- Suce-moi, sale brouteuse.
Où est mon avocat ?
Sale gouine.
T'as une seule chance, espèce d'enculé.
Tu balances les mecs
pour qui tu as tué William Gant
ou tu vas te prendre la totale.
Je vais te dire un truc :
Détache-moi, approche
et je te nique dans les trois trous.
Putain, charmant, celui-là.
Salope.
Vous avez rien sur moi.
- L'un de vous devrait y aller.
- Elle a des ennuis ?
Kima ? S'il continue, elle va le démolir.
Que dalle !
Vous avez que dalle !
T'es mon témoin oculaire, alors ?
Pourquoi tu t'engages là-dessus ?
Bird est dégueulasse. Il a tué un travailleur.
Te goure pas, je suis pas blanc non plus,
mais j'ai jamais mis mon flingue
sur un mec qu'est pas de la partie.
L'homme doit avoir un code.
C'est sûr.
- Je t'ai déjà vu quelque part.
- Ah oui ?
J'étais dans le quartier sud-ouest
avant la Crim.
J'ai bossé sur Frederick Road.
Non, je veux dire, il y a longtemps.
T'es allé à Edmondson, non ?
Ouais, t'étais une classe au-dessus.
Je me souviens, t'es le premier frère
que j'ai vu jouer avec une crosse.
Comment ça s'appelle ?
- Lacrosse.
- Ouais, c'est ça.
Oui, j'étais attaquant pour All-Metro.
Les mecs de la prépa se pissaient dessus
quand ils voyaient le vieux Bunk arriver.
Écoute, mon pote.
Comme t'es généreux avec tes souvenirs,
qu'est-ce que t'as d'autre
en meurtres non classés ?
- En rapport avec Barksdale ?
- Ou autre.
- Tu veux que je remonte à loin ?
- Aussi loin que tu peux.
Un meurtre reste un meurtre.
Merci.
Le flingue est le bon.
T'es foutu, Bird.
Dernière chance de sauver ta peau
par un deal.
Tu peux bouffer ma merde,
sale pédale de keublan.
C'est ça. Embarque la bouffeuse de minous
tant que t'y es.
J'ai des menottes, mec.
Tu vas me donner ma chance, non ?
Arrête, mec. Tu me frappes pas comme ça.
SALLE D'INTERROGATOIRE 1
ATTENTION - NE LAISSEZ PAS
LE PRISONNIER SANS SURVEILLANCE
Gros connard !
Enlève-moi les menottes !
Fulton et Baker, tu dis ?
C'est arrivé l'an dernier,
un ou deux jours après Pâques.
Une fille qui s'appelait Neecee.
Environ 30, 35 ans.
Denise Redding.
Oui, je l'ai.
Bon sang.
Bird fait de l'effet, hein ?
Allô ?
L'affaire Lindsey, c'est ça ?
Non, Lindsey. Martin Lindsey.
Qui c'est Denise Redding, putain ?
- Qu'est-ce que vous lui avez fait, putain ?
- Il est à toi, Mike.
Je me souviens même pas
de celle-là, putain. Je te jure.
Ben, elle est classée.
Le type a fait une déclaration,
deux témoins et identification du tueur.
Avec nos remerciements.
Sanny.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous en ville
à cette heure-ci ?
Putain, madame LaRue.
Faut que je te dise merci, Jay,
tu m'as sauvé la vie, putain.
Ce que je pige pas, c'est que je lui ai parlé
de l'affaire Lindsey, pas de celle-ci.
Mike,
Iaisse tomber la gitane.
C'est eux qui t'ont sauvé la vie.
Merci.
Jimmy.
Faut qu'on parle, mec.
C'est au sujet de Rawls.
T'as prévu quoi ?
De baiser bourré un mardi soir ?
- Ou mercredi matin, plutôt ?
- Je suis pas bourré.
C'est Rawls.
Il veut me virer.
Quoi ?
Ils vont me virer, Ronnie.
Ils vont me virer.
J'adore ce putain de boulot
et ils vont me virer.
Viens.
Numéro 18.
Conine.
J'ai deviné.
Bon, celle-là, c'est pour Mikey.
- Que désirez-vous ?
- Une citronnade, s'il vous plaît.
T'es prêt ?
Le numéro 6.
Je sais.
- David Segui ?
- Melvin Mora, idiot !
Je croyais que Mora était numéro 9.
Je vais jouer au jeu de l'espion.
Vous vous en souvenez ?
- Ouais.
- C'est qui ?
Le grand Black, là-bas.
Il faut dire Afro-Américain, papa.
Bon, Afro-Américain.
- Je passe devant, tu suis.
- Je l'ai déjà fait la dernière fois.
Ne discute pas. Allez.
Dégage !
Je m'en occupe.
Ils sont bruns tous les deux,
l'un grand comme ça, et l'autre, comme ça.
Et il porte... qu'est-ce qu'il porte, putain ?
Michael et Sean McNulty
sont priés de se présenter au bureau
à l'arrière du marché.
Michael et Sean McNulty.
S'il vous plaît, présentez-vous.

"Si tu vises le roi, faut pas te planter."
-- Omar
Un téléphone public en panne veut rien dire.
Mais deux en même temps, c'est fait exprès.
Téléphone public - HORS SERVICE
- On leur a fait peur.
- Avec le fugitif ?
C'est soit ça, soit autre chose.
On a encore les téléphones des tours.
Et on a le pager de Stringer Bell sur écoute.
Ouais, mais ça montre qu'ils font gaffe.
Dès qu'on bouge, ils changent de plan.
S'ils n'utilisent pas
les cabines téléphoniques des pavillons,
comment ils font ?
Ils vont à une autre cabine.
Il va peut-être y avoir plus d'appels
des téléphones des tours.
L'examen de sergent est demain, hein ?
À 16 h.
Tu ne le passes pas, cette fois ?
Si, pourquoi pas ?
- Tu ne vas pas réviser ?
- Mais si.
Il faut suivre les mecs qui sortent de la cour
pour voir quelles cabines ils utilisent.
Excuse-moi, mais c'est un ordre officiel ?
Tout ce que je dis...
Si tu veux suivre ces cons
de cabine en cabine,
fais-le toi-même.
Moi, je fais la paperasse, tu te souviens ?
- Ah oui, ils ont pris ton flingue.
- Pour avoir tiré dans ta caisse.
Non, ça, c'était avant.
- C'est vrai, c'était autre chose.
- Ouais.
Putain, il se prend pour un gradé, ou quoi ?
Il va falloir monter sur les toits, aujourd'hui.
Pour aller voir
de quels téléphones ils se servent.
Putain, regarde-moi ça.
Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Fais voir.
- Bird m'en a parlé.
Quelle putain de tapette, sans déconner !
M. Omar, vous voulez le reste ?
Non, chérie, ça va.
Jolie chemise.
Je t'emmerde.
Il faut du courage
pour porter une chemise rose à la Crim.
C'est vrai.
Du courage, ou un certain intérêt
pour les minorités sexuelles.
- Qu'est-ce que tu cherches ?
- Une Toyota Camry.
À qui elle appartient ?
À une femme qui habite en banlieue,
mais samedi,
c'est Stringer Bell qui la conduisait.
T'as bossé ce week-end ?
Non, mais j'étais au marché avec les gamins,
- et qui je vois ?
- Jour de marché pour String ?
Si j'avais approché, il m'aurait reconnu
alors je l'ai fait filer par les mômes.
Ils ont tellement assuré que je les ai perdus
et je me suis mis à flipper.
Mais ils sont restés près de lui,
ont vu la Camry,
et Sean, mon propre fils,
a noté l'immatriculation.
Tes gamins savent faire une filature ?
Ils adorent ça. On joue parfois aux espions
au centre commercial.
Enfin, j'ai l'adresse
d'une femme à Woodmore
qui prête sa caisse à Stringer Bell.
- C'est un début.
- Bonjour la famille McNulty. Putain.
Quoi ?
Wallace.
- Quoi ?
- Wallace.
- Quoi ?
- C'est quoi, ce truc ?
Ça ?
"Un bus qui descend l'avenue centrale
commence par prendre huit passagers.
"À l'arrêt suivant, quatre autres montent,
puis deux de plus, et un passager descend.
"À l'avant-dernier arrêt,
trois passagers descendent du bus,
"et deux autres montent. Combien
de passagers reste-t-il au dernier arrêt ?"
Calcule dans ta tête.
Les échantillons arrivent aujourd'hui.
Une nouvelle livraison.
J'irai faire un tour plus tard.
Plus tard ?
Je te retrouverai dans le quartier.
Wallace, tu ne peux pas rester ici.
- Sept, c'est ça ?
- Dee veut savoir ce qui se passe.
- Et alors ?
- Je lui ai dit que t'étais malade,
mais ça va pas marcher longtemps.
Écoute, je vais descendre tout à l'heure.
- Non, y aura plus d'échantillons.
- Rien à battre, des échantillons. Pigé ?
Rien à battre des échantillons,
de Dee et du reste.
Prête-moi 10 $ et je te les rends vendredi.
Comment ?
Dee va pas te payer si tu bosses pas.
Bon, tu me files 10 $, ou quoi ?
Huit ?
Putain, Sarah, écoute. Ferme les yeux.
Tu vends du matos. 20 capsules roses.
Deux camés prennent deux capsules
chacun, un autre en prend trois.
Puis Bodie t'en refile 10,
mais un Blanc se pointe en bagnole,
te fait signe et en prend huit.
Il te reste combien de capsules ?
Quinze.
Comment tu fais pour calculer ça
et pas résoudre le problème de maths ?
Si tu te plantes, tu te fais casser la gueule.
- Non, il va venir.
- Aujourd'hui ?
- Ouais.
- Il est pressé ou quoi ?
Non, on lui a dit de faire comme ça.
Il l'a demandé hier soir
et on lui a dit de se pointer ce matin.
- Il ne vient pas dans la tour ?
- Non.
File-lui-en juste 20, et il dégage. Compris ?
- Il sera là dans environ une heure.
- Qui le saura ?
- Little Man, il connaît Day.
- D'accord.
C'était Stringer Bell ?
Il appelait la cabine N°1 de la tour
après avoir été bipé il y a 15 mn.
- On connaît Little Man ?
- Oui.
Il est homme de main au 221 .
Bon, dans environ 30 mn, il va sortir du 221
pour refiler 20 Dieu sait quoi
à un type du nom de Day.
Du matos qui vient des tours.
D'habitude,
on essaie de le choper à l'entrée.
Bon, si on veut les attraper,
il faut se magner.
Wallace déconne.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il fout ?
- Rien.
Il fait rien de la journée.
Il m'a tapé de la thune pour bouffer.
Tu te fais du souci pour lui ?
Ça va pas, Dee.
Tu devrais lui parler.
Écoute, s'il veut pas venir,
c'est son problème.
Personne le force.
Ouais, mais il fait rien d'autre.
Il reste à rien glander
dans sa chambre toute la journée.
Il reste à rien glander
dans sa chambre toute la journée.
D'accord, dis-lui de venir me voir.
D'accord.
Je reviens.
Ça fait deux heures.
Et si Little Man ne bosse pas au 221,
aujourd'hui ?
Et si Day ne vient pas ?
Et s'il était venu
et qu'on ait loupé l'échange ?
Putain, Herc, et si tes parents
s'étaient jamais rencontrés ?
- Comment vont les affaires ?
- Ça roule.
Viens, on va faire un tour.
- Bouffer un sandwich.
- Où ça ?
Chez Pulaski, le meilleur.
Monte en voiture.
Poot ! C'est toi qui gères
pendant une heure.
Putain, regardez-moi.
- Kima.
- La Lincoln ? On la voit.
Attends de voir où il va.
J'ai jamais compris.
Bey, comment tu peux bouffer ça
avec toute cette sauce piquante ?
Il suffit de s'en foutre.
Je suis comme ça, tu me connais.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Mon oncle vous a donné la journée ?
Non, on fait la fête.
Stinkum a eu des points
grâce à de nouveaux territoires.
J'ai appris ça.
Y a en combien pour toi, dans ce matos ?
20.
On doit virer les mecs qui étaient déjà là.
Ça sera pas dur.
C'est qu'une bande d'amateurs.
Et si toi, tu continues comme ça,
tu vas cartonner aussi.
J'attends que ça.
Ça va venir, hein, Stink ?
Ouais, j'ai parlé à Orlando.
Il a dit qu'il avait un bon plan coke
à la Nouvelle-Orléans.
Orlando ?
Il veut que je revende dans la cour,
en me prenant une marge.
Je sais pas,
tu ferais mieux d'en parler à ton oncle.
- C'est vrai.
- Tu vois ?
Ouais, je vais voir ce qu'il dit.
Mais aujourd'hui, c'est votre grand jour.
- Le jour de Stink.
- Et sa soirée.
Ouais, on va s'éclater, mon pote.
On va emmener
des meufs de chez Orlando chez Little Man.
- Ouais.
- Ouais.
Tu nous accompagnes ?
- Bien sûr que oui.
- Tu viens.
Bien sûr que je viens.
Faut pas me demander deux fois.
- Qu'est-ce qui va pas ?
- Rien.
Là, il s'en fout plus.
De l'eau.
- Descendez de voiture, monsieur.
- Pourquoi ?
Descendez de voiture.
Rejoignez mon coéquipier.
- Je suis en retard.
- Posez les mains sur le toit.
Monsieur, on vous a vu, dans un quartier
classé sans drogue et sans racolage,
avec un suspect
qui s'est penché vers votre véhicule
et vous a passé quelque chose.
Et quand on vous a fait signe
de vous arrêter,
vous vous êtes penché
comme pour cacher quelque chose
- sous le siège du passager.
- Écoutez, ça suffit.
- Y a-t-il quelque chose sous ce siège ?
- Non.
Alors ça ne vous dérange pas
si on regarde ?
Allez vous faire foutre. Quelles conneries !
- C'est pas vos affaires, compris ?
- Ça, c'est moi que ça regarde.
Vous m'avez appelé ?
- Qui c'est ?
- Damien Lavell Price.
Il a sorti 20 000 $ en cash de la tour 221 .
Lester a eu l'info
par l'un des téléphones de la tour.
On l'a suivi jusqu'à ce qu'il nous repère.
- C'est un juriste ?
- Qui m'a bipé ?
Il est dans votre bureau.
On l'a arrêté avec 20 000 $ en cash.
- Pour quel motif ?
- Suite à une écoute.
Stringer Bell a appelé
d'un téléphone des tours.
On pensait trouver de la drogue.
Au lieu de ça, on a eu de l'argent.
Je le connais.
Les Orioles ont gagné hier soir.
Ils ont tenu le coup contre Boston.
Vous avez cambriolé quelqu'un, ou quoi ?
Je voudrais parler à mon avocat.
Il conduisait un politicien
à une soirée de bienfaisance.
- Qui ?
- Quelqu'un d'Annapolis,
d'après ses papiers, en tout cas.
- Sur quoi on l'inculpe ?
- Il dit que c'est son argent ?
Il ne dit rien du tout.
Il ne dit rien du tout.
Gardez l'argent, donnez-lui un reçu.
S'il veut le réclamer à la ville,
il peut toujours le faire.
Mais ils lui demanderont d'où vient l'argent.
L'ange de la mort.
Qui est-ce ?
Le major Reed, de l'l.G.S.
Lieutenant, je veux vous parler.
Chez Orlando - Club pour Messieurs
Quoi de neuf ?
- Comment ça va ?
- Moi ?
Oui, toi. Tout va bien ?
Ça va.
Je veux dire, t'as assez d'argent ?
Parce que si t'as besoin de quelque chose,
il suffit de demander.
Je fais que ça : te filer de la thune
pour m'assurer
que tu feras pas cavalier seul.
Reste assis.
Écoute, le dernier truc dont j'ai besoin,
c'est de me faire bousiller ma licence IV
par un mec comme toi.
Je me fais comprendre ?
Putain, Avon !
Fais ton boulot, bordel !
J'ai vérifié auprès
du service des Fonctionnaires.
Il est employé
par le bureau du sénateur Davis
depuis plus d'un an.
Il a pris quatre ans à Hagerstown
pour effraction.
Aussi inculpé pour drogue
et préventive pour faux et usage de faux.
Et là, il se fait prendre en sortant des tours
avec 20 000 $ en coupures impeccables.
Vous l'avez amené sous quelle inculpation ?
Saisie civile.
Jusqu'à ce qu'il nous dise
d'où vient cet argent, nous le gardons.
Donc, il n'y a pas d'inculpation.
Non, seulement l'argent.
Rendez-le.
- Pardon ?
- Rendez-lui l'argent.
On a obtenu cette information
sur table d'écoute,
un suspect a dit qu'un homme
allait passer prendre quelque chose.
- C'est de l'argent de la drogue.
- Rendez-lui son argent.
Dans le dossier, écrivez :
arrestation injustifiée.
Ce que je vous demande,
c'est d'inculper un dealer, lieutenant.
C'est tout.
Et là, je nage dans des tables d'écoute
et des déclarations sous serment.
Et vous qui vous occupez
de ce qui ne vous regarde pas.
- Monsieur...
- Je boucle l'affaire, lieutenant.
Faites les inculpations que vous pouvez,
et ce, d'ici la fin de la semaine.
- On fait rien de mal.
- Vous arrêtez l'employé d'un sénateur.
Vous l'allégez de 20 000 $.
Et sans inculpation,
vous trouvez très malin de tout garder.
Vous vous foutez dans la merde,
et tout le monde avec.
Je vous avais dit : "Pas de surprises",
vous vous rappelez ?
Et voilà 20 000 $.
Signez ici, ou vous pouvez recompter,
si vous voulez.
Je peux partir, maintenant ?
Est-ce que quelqu'un peut m'expliquer
ce bordel ?
Quelle connerie.
On vient juste de rendre
20 000 $ à Barksdale.
C'est quoi, ce délire ?
Laissez-moi deviner, le préfet adjoint ?
Comment a-t-il su si vite ?
- Je lui ai parlé.
- Quoi ?
Pourquoi faire ça ?
C'est le préfet adjoint,
et j'avais arrêté l'employé d'un sénateur.
Comment ne rien dire ?
Vous avez remarqué
que le sénateur n'a pas porté plainte ?
Vous savez pourquoi ?
Pourquoi est-ce que son chauffeur
sort de la cité avec autant d'argent ?
- J'en ai parlé.
- Il a répondu quoi ?
Occupez-vous de vos oignons ?
Rendez-lui son argent et tirez-vous ?
À peu près ça.
Sauf qu'il a rajouté
quelques trucs pour ma gouverne.
J'ai foutu la merde.
Il nous dessaisit de l'affaire cette semaine.
- C'est ce qu'on va voir.
- C'est terminé.
Si je continue après vendredi, je suis grillé.
Il va vous griller ? Pourquoi ?
Vous faites votre boulot.
Vous croyez que ça va me sauver ?
Et vous, ça va vous sauver ?
La hiérarchie.
Voilà ce à quoi j'ai eu droit, aujourd'hui.
La hiérarchie ?
Vous avez parlé du chauffeur du sénateur
au major ? Ou au colonel ?
Non ? Alors elle est où, la hiérarchie ?
Depuis quand un lieutenant
parle en douce au préfet adjoint ?
- Qu'est-ce que vous en dites ?
- Rien.
Vous avez bien raison.
Pourquoi, il a un truc sur vous ?
Vous dites que l'adjoint vous écoute.
Il a quoi sur vous ?
Seulement son grade, inspecteur.
Hé, Stink ! Et la règle, alors ?
C'est une occasion spéciale.
Salut, Bey.
- Je vais vomir.
- Mais non.
Burrell pense que je l'ai trahi.
C'est ce qu'il t'a dit ?
Plus ou moins.
- Il faut que tu lui expliques...
- Quoi ?
Que je monte un dossier
qui implique tout le monde ?
Aujourd'hui,
c'était le chauffeur d'un sénateur.
Dans deux jours,
un conseiller municipal, peut-être.
Il veut qu'on inculpe Barksdale, c'est tout.
Qui aurait pu prévoir le coup du juriste ?
Burrell l'a vu venir.
C'est le truc que tout le monde sait
et dont personne ne parle.
On suit la drogue,
on trouve une affaire de drogue.
Quand on suit l'argent,
on ne sait pas où on atterrit.
C'est pour ça, ils veulent pas de tables
d'écoute ou de trucs qu'ils contrôlent pas.
Parce qu'une fois le magnéto branché,
qui sait ce qui va se dire ?
Ce connard de McNulty m'a demandé
ce que l'adjoint savait sur moi.
Il m'a vraiment demandé ça.
Qu'est-ce que t'as dit ?
Où est passé tout le monde ?
Où sont les filles ?
La fête est finie, mon pote.
On a fini de baiser et de se pinter.
Vous m'envoyez chercher à boire,
et quand je reviens, c'est mort ?
Regarde ça.
Les Knicks
ont encore foiré leur recrutement.
Qu'est-ce qu'elle a ?
Je l'ai baisée à mort.
Qu'est-ce que je peux dire ?
Elle a aussi sniffé la moitié
de ce qu'on avait apporté, la salope.
Bey.
- Tu voulais nous voir ?
- Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ?
On me l'a fait suivre ce matin.
C'est exactement ce dont ça a l'air.
Une note signée du préfet adjoint, de Rawls
et de Forester nous disant de tout arrêter.
On arrête les écoutes vendredi,
on rend les ordinateurs lundi,
on inculpe qui on peut
la semaine prochaine.
Ah oui ? Et qui vous avez ?
Quelques types sans importance,
Anton Artis, alias Stinkum.
Bird, un tueur recherché
pour le meurtre de Gant.
C'était le témoin au tribunal.
- C'est tout ?
- À part quelques autres, oui.
Pourquoi font-ils ça ?
Pourquoi maintenant ?
On a arrêté un transporteur
qui sortait des tours
avec 20 000 $ en cash, hier.
- Et alors ?
- Il travaille pour Clay Davis.
39e circonscription.
Le préfet adjoint n'était pas content.
Mais c'est pas grave.
On a rendu l'argent et on s'est excusés.
- Que peut faire Daniels ?
- Que dalle.
Le préfet adjoint lui a envoyé
la même injonction qu'à vous.
Appelez-moi Burrell !
Inspecteurs, quand vous avez prêté serment,
qu'a fait le Tribunal correctionnel ?
- On nous a donné la table d'écoute.
- Pour combien de temps, McNulty ?
Soixante jours, non ?
Combien de temps avez-vous surveillé
ces lignes téléphoniques ?
Environ 40 jours.
Le préfet adjoint Burrell est au téléphone.
Erv, ici Phelan.
T'es en train de te foutre de ma gueule.
Si, je t'assure.
Erv, écoute.
Le Tribunal correctionnel
a signé deux autorisations
de surveillance téléphonique
pour un total de 60 jours.
Et là, j'ai la copie
d'une note de service de ton bureau
qui me dit que je n'ai pas mes 60 jours.
Je me suis mal fait comprendre.
Le Tribunal correctionnel de Baltimore
a ordonné 60 jours d'écoute.
La Cour veut ses 60 jours.
Si vendredi, t'arrêtes les écoutes, lundi,
tu te retrouves avec un outrage à magistrat.
Compris ?
Passe le bonjour à Arlene et aux enfants.
Oui.
Merci qui ?
Écoutez, je n'ai rien fait, lieutenant.
S'il y a un problème, c'est avec le juge.
Oui, il a eu la note de l'adjoint
et il a tiré ses conclusions.
Demandez à Greggs
si vous ne me croyez pas.
Écoutez, il faut que j'y aille.
Kima.
Le préfet adjoint a appelé, super en colère.
Dis-leur d'arrêter d'emballer,
on retourne sur écoute.
Kima.
C'est McNulty ou le juge ? Ou les deux ?
Cette fois, c'est le juge.
Pose-moi une question. N'importe laquelle.
Je croyais que tu révisais pas.
Ce boulot, c'est du bon sens.
Pose-moi une question, ducon.
Pour voir où j'en suis.
"D'après le Q1 ..."
Attends un peu.
Il faut connaître les numéros ?
Ça aide.
Ça donne l'air plus professionnel.
"D'après le Q1,
"la consigne générale
concernant le harcèlement sexuel,
"si une inspectrice de votre équipe se plaint
"que son coéquipier
l'a harcelée sexuellement
"vous devez :
"A : Prévenir l'officier supérieur.
"B : Prévenir le lieutenant de service.
"C : Prévenir une femme officier
de rang supérieur."
Je dirais D.
D ?
J'éclate le coéquipier
qui s'est servi de ce qui m'appartient,
je ramène la meuf et je la baise
jusqu'à ce qu'elle sourie.
Hein ?
UNIVERSITÉ DE BALTIMORE
Quand un petit changement de prix
crée une grosse fluctuation de la demande,
alors on dit que la demande est élastique.
Certains produits ne sont pas élastiques.
À savoir, un changement de prix
n'affecte pas la demande.
Quels sont les facteurs-clés
qui affectent l'élasticité de la demande ?
- M. Bell ?
- Le désir.
Le besoin du consommateur.
Précisément, la capacité du consommateur
à retarder son achat. Quoi d'autre ?
INTRODUCTION À LA MACROÉCONOMIE
Mon crayon est émoussé.
C'est ce que disent les filles.
Damon, on a des commandes
et rien n'avance.
Elles auraient dû être prêtes hier,
les clients vont venir
réclamer leurs travaux, et rien n'aura été fait.
Qu'ils crèvent. Ils peuvent attendre.
Ici, c'est pas la rue,
alors tu vas changer d'attitude, compris ?
Tu sais ce qu'on a, ici ?
Un produit élastique.
Et tu sais ce que ça veut dire ?
Ça veut dire que si les gens peuvent
aller faire faire leurs photocopies ailleurs,
ils le font.
Et toi, tu fais
comme si le produit était non élastique.
Je veux que ce truc marche
comme un vrai commerce.
Pas comme une couverture.
C'est compris ?
Je suis sérieux.
- Où t'as chouré cette caisse ?
- Sur la route Frederick.
Laisse-la dans l'Eastside quand on aura fini.
Regarde. Lui, là, et l'autre type.
C'est les seuls qui risquent de faire chier.
Je descends Scar,
et toi, tu t'occupes de l'autre.
Non, juste Scar.
Si son pote se casse, on le laisse aller.
- Mais s'il résiste, je m'occupe de lui.
- J'aurais voulu que Bird soit là.
Il aurait adoré ça.
Ce qui me rappelle
que quand on se cassera,
il faudra balancer le flingue
dans une bouche d'égout.
Laisse-moi faire le tour du pâté de maisons
et m'installer de l'autre côté, d'accord ?
Salut, qui a des capsules noires ?
Hé, toi.
Putain !
Écoute, Bey.
Si tu vises le roi, faut pas te planter.
- Stink s'est fait buter.
- Stink ?
- Bey s'est pris une balle dans lajambe.
- Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
- Ils se sont fait descendre sur Edmondson.
- Putain de Scar.
- Non, c'est pas lui. C'est Omar.
- Omar ?
Sa tête va être mise à prix.
Ça nous fout dans la merde.
Stinkum était sur le point d'être arrêté
pour le fugitif,
et maintenant, il est hors-jeu.
Ce type est vraiment imprévisible.
- On peut le dire.
- Il faut qu'on le coffre.
Il y a 10 000 $ sur sa tête.
L'un de vous doit s'en occuper.
- T'es allé où ?
- À l'hôpital général du Maryland.
Je leur ai dit que je m'étais pris
une balle perdue au coin de la rue.
- T'as parlé aux flics ?
- Aux îlotiers, pas à la Crim.
Tout le monde doit être au courant,
pas que nos gars.
Parlez à tous les types que ça intéresse.
Faites passer le mot.
10 000 $ sur la tête d'Omar
ou ceux qui sont avec lui.
Vous ne faites rien
avant d'avoir retrouvé cet enculé.
- Au boulot.
- D'accord.
Qu'est-ce que t'en penses ?
C'est la pire partie du jeu.
- Au mieux, on sera quittes.
- Quoi ?
C'est devenu une affaire personnelle.
C'est tout.
- Tu veux dire qu'on devrait arrêter.
- Pendant quelque temps, peut-être.
Il faudrait faire savoir
qu'on est prêts à demander une trêve.
Et quand il sort de son trou, tu le butes.
Mais pour l'instant,
cette histoire est devenue hors contrôle.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez que je dise ?
Je sais rien sur le meurtre de Stink,
et je sais rien sur Bey
qui s'est fait tirer dessus.
- Je sais rien de cette histoire de dingues.
- Nous, on l'a su rapidement.
Vous savez comment c'est.
Tout le monde est prêt à dire le pire d'Omar.
Mais il faut vivre et laisser vivre.
Je t'imagine pas ne pas venger Brandon.
Si j'en voulais à certaines personnes,
je ne ferais sûrement rien
pour vous inquiéter.
Ici, on a des règles.
- Des règles ?
- Ouais.
Pas d'erreurs, pas de balles perdues.
Pas de passants
qui se font tirer dessus par erreur.
Tu t'approches, et tu butes le bon mec.
Et tu balances le flingue après.
Ça aussi, c'est une règle, non ?
Je vais te dire un truc, Omar.
La mort de Stinkum
nous fout dans la merde.
Comment ça ?
On allait choper Stink
avec 4 briques de matos.
On aurait peut-être pu l'inculper.
- Et le coffrer avec Stringer.
- Maintenant, rien ne nous amène à lui.
Alors, même si on t'est reconnaissants
de nous avoir donné Bird,
et qu'on admire ton esprit d'initiative...
Il faut que tu te tiennes à carreau.
Écoutez, ça ne tient pas qu'à moi.
Ma tête est mise à prix.
Ouais, on a vu la camionnette.
Écoutez, je fais ce que je peux
pour vous aider, mais le jeu se passe là-bas.
Et maintenant, ça passe ou ça casse.
Quoi, c'est tout ?
Messieurs. Madame.
Lester, on est toujours flics ?
- Techniquement, sans doute.
- Je voulais juste savoir.
Keisha n'a pas appelé et elle est pas rentrée.
Elle allait comment quand tu l'as quittée ?
Elle était malade, je te l'ai dit.
Elle n'est pas allée bosser hier soir
et elle n'a pas pris sa paie aujourd'hui.
Tu sais quoi ?
Ce jeu...
Ce truc avec mon oncle.
C'est peut-être pas pour moi.
Pourquoi tu dis ça ?
Le seul truc bien, c'est l'argent.
Mon boulot, c'est pareil.
Tu vois, les gens s'utilisent.
Ils s'arnaquent entre eux.
Ils s'étripent pour un retard de paiement.
Ils butent des gens pour un peu de thune.
Au point que parfois, j'étouffe.
Je manque d'air.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
Fais autre chose.
- Et toi, ton boulot te plaît ?
- Putain.
Alors fais autre chose.
Il va bien falloir. Merde.
Je serai pas toujours jolie.
Ça durera pas toujours, hein, Dee ?
Et après, quoi ?
T'es jolie maintenant.
Ça, c'est joli.
Je vous rappelle.
Dee.
Ramène ta fraise. Stink s'est fait buter.
T'as entendu ? lls ont buté Stink.
J'ai besoin de ton aide.
Qui s'est occupé de l'appel d'Edmondson,
la nuit dernière ? Anton Artis.
Cole, avec l'aide de Dunnigan.
- C'est Omar qui l'a buté.
- Putain.
On a su ça par la table d'écoute.
Voyons.
On arrive à résoudre un meurtre
grâce à un témoin oculaire
qui s'empresse d'aller buter quelqu'un.
Ouais, il a vengé son copain, Brandon.
Anton Artis était l'un des types
qui ont kidnappé Brandon et l'ont tué.
Je suis sûr
que ce con avait ses raisons, Jimmy...
Si tu veux te débarrasser de l'affaire Gant,
donne le nom du tueur à Cole.
Si tu veux te débarrasser de l'affaire Gant,
donne le nom du tueur à Cole.
Sinon, dis-lui
qu'on entend des trucs sur écoute
et qu'on lui filera la solution
quand on aura bouclé notre affaire.
Mais vous le ferez pas.
C'est vrai.
Tu veux que j'aille raconter des conneries
à Cole pour toi ?
- T'as qu'à aller lui dire toi-même.
- Tu plaisantes ?
Si Rawls apprend que je suis mêlé à ça,
il me passera les couilles au mixer.
Va te faire foutre.
- Comment ça avance ?
- Pas mal.
J'aime bien ce type
qui baise l'ancienne copine de ma victime.
Ray, je peux te parler un instant ?
Dans mon bureau.
Dans une affaire comme ça, on se retrouve
dans de drôles de situations.
Cole assure cette année.
Il a pas besoin de résoudre le cas.
Bon, je sais que ça le fout dans la merde.
T'aurais dû voir sa gueule quand je lui ai dit
que tu allais lui donner le tueur.
Il était content ?
Ouais. Il m'a regardé avec des yeux de chiot.
- Je suis désolé, Bunk.
- J'assume.
Tant pis.
Non, ce soir, c'est moi qui régale.
Écoute, je vais bouger.
Voici l'argent que j'aurais dépensé pour toi.
Jimmy.
Appelle Nadine
et dis-lui que j'ai été appelé sur une affaire.
J'ai menti pour toi, non ?
- T'as une minute ?
- Oui, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Je crois que j'ai merdé.
Ah bon ?
Il y a quelques semaines,
j'ai interrogé Omar.
Et il m'a dit que c'est Bird qui a buté Gant.
Et que si on chopait Bird,
il aurait le flingue sur lui.
Et c'est vrai.
Mais je lui ai dit
qu'on avait besoin d'un témoin oculaire.
Et il s'est porté volontaire.
Il l'a peut-être vu.
Ou bien il a raconté ça
parce qu'il voulait qu'on coffre Bird.
J'ai l'impression
qu'ils ne s'aimaient pas beaucoup.
J'ai merdé, hein ?
Un peu. Mais c'est le bon flingue.
Et ça coïncide avec la description
et l'histoire de notre témoin.
Alors ne t'inquiète pas trop.
Kima.
Tu sais, l'interrogatoire,
c'est plus un art qu'une science.
On avance surtout à l'instinct.
Tiens, jette un coup d'oeil là-dessus.
Qui est-ce ?
Des danseuses
qui bossent dans la boîte de Barksdale.
J'ai eu leurs noms
aux plaintes du registre des Alcools
et au registre des Fonctionnaires.
Si tu voulais obtenir des infos
d'une de ces filles, tu choisirais laquelle ?
Elle.
Pourquoi ?
Elle n'a pas de casier.
Juste une photo de permis de conduire.
Quoi d'autre ?
Je ne sais pas.
Je ne peux pas vraiment dire.
Elle a une bonne tête.
Une âme, une conscience, appelle ça
comme tu veux. C'est une citoyenne, hein ?
C'est dans les yeux.
L'instinct, inspecteur.
Oui ?
Quoi ?
Qui êtes-vous ?
Vraiment ?
Comment avez-vous eu mon numéro ?
Oui, d'accord.
Oui.
- Madame ?
- Virez-moi ce connard d'ici.
- Que se passe-t-il ?
- Il a déclenché l'alarme d'incendie.
C'était si bon que ça ?
Dans la salle de bains.
Bunk, c'est Jimmy.
C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
Réveille-toi, merde.
- Réveille-toi.
- Quoi ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
- Je t'entends.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Où sont tes vêtements ?
Là.
- On s'en fout.
- Arrête.
Non.
Pourquoi t'as brûlé tes vêtements ?
Y a des cheveux, des fibres
de la chatte et...
Quoi, des preuves ?
Tu sens la chatte ? Moi, je sens plus rien.
- Arrête.
- Je crois que tu peux me ramener chez moi.
Le labo ne trouvera
aucune preuve contre moi.
Y aura pas d'enquête, inspecteur.
Où sont tes pompes ?
Madame, vous avez vu ses chaussures ?
Tu me files ta chatte
et puis tu me prends mes chaussures ?
Ça se fait pas.
Merde.
Putain.
J'admets que c'est logique
de vouloir brûler les preuves.
Mais qu'est-ce que tu comptais porter
pour rentrer ?
Merde.
Tu sais quoi ?
T'es pas une bonne influence.
C'est vrai. Tout le monde autour de toi...
Putain.
Celui qui a la balle, il est ŕ Dunbar.
Il est en D.E.U.G., mais il ira loin
s'il a de bonnes notes.
Ce mec-lŕ, c'est notre chance.
- Il va oů ?
- Je ne sais pas.
Chez les Terps ou les Hoyas.
Au Missouri, au Kansas : ils le veulent tous.
Cette fois-ci, on sera ŕ la hauteur, hein ?
Proposition Joe va halluciner.
Il a personne qui joue comme ça.
Il a pas intéręt ŕ en avoir un
qui joue comme ça.
J'en ai marre de perdre
contre ces putes de l'Eastside.
Déjŕ trois ans d'affilée. Ça me sape le moral.
Et le pédé ?
Omar ?
- Il s'est volatilisé.
- Comment ça, "volatilisé" ?
La ville est pas si grande.
Tu sais ce qu'il a fait, quand il s'est barré ?
Il a pris un peu de came
et il est allé dans le quartier
distribuer des échantillons gratos.
Il se la joue Robin des Bois.
Si on le cherche,
tout le monde va en parler.
Si tu veux qu'on le retrouve,
on le retrouvera.
Mais la bonne méthode,
ce serait de lui accorder une tręve,
de lui foutre la paix pendant quelque temps.
Le pédé va se détendre,
et pointer le bout de son nez.
Et lŕ, on le chope.
Et qu'est-ce qu'ils vont dire,
ces enculés, en attendant ?
Qu'est-ce qu'ils vont dire
en voyant ce suceur de bite
se pavaner en plein jour ?
Que j'en ai rien ŕ foutre qu'il m'ait volé.
- Je vous avais dit qu'il était bon.
- Oui, il assure.
Je ne sais pas ce qu'on va faire sans lui,
l'an prochain.
- Pourquoi t'as pas de contrat ?
- J'ai des offres.
- Je vous écoute.
- 10 000 $, c'est pas trop mal, non ?
- Pas trop mal, non.
- 10 000 $ pour le môme, plus 5 000 $
de don au programme.
Ça marche.
Bien. Fais-moi 30 lancers francs
et casse-toi.
Salut mec, et bravo.
C'est bien, mon grand.
Et disons 5 000 $ de plus
pour avoir organisé la rencontre.
Rien n'est gratuit, hein ?

"On a peut-ętre gagné."
-- Herc
Tu fais comment pour le fric ?
On peut pas vivre sans fric.
C'est cette histoire de vol qui te perturbe ?
C'est pas de ta faute. Ni de la mienne.
Le connard qui a volé la came
a tiré sur Sterling.
Il va se faire choper, quoi qu'on fasse.
Je veux pas jouer. Je veux plus jouer.
Tu comprends ?
Je pensais aller ŕ l'école, ŕ Edmondson,
s'ils veulent bien me reprendre
ŕ la fin du trimestre.
- En quelle classe ?
- En 4e.
En 4e ? Putain, t'as quel âge ?
Seize ans.
Seize ans.
Tu devrais ętre en seconde, normalement.
Il paraît que Stinkum s'est fait buter.
Ouais.
Putain.
- Je veux plus jouer, j'ai dit.
- Je sais.
Et je te demande rien.
J'ai compris. Prends.
Dépęche, les gens nous regardent.
Écoute, t'en as dans le citron.
Retourne ŕ Edmondson,
tu finiras ŕ Harvard ou un truc comme ça.
Crois-moi, mon pote.
Et t'as bon coeur.
Pas comme ces connards.
- Oui ?
- Ronnie Mo, le téléphone de la tour 2.
D'accord.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous ?
Tu viens chercher la came, ou quoi ?
T'énerve pas, on fait des rondes.
- Je suis pas aussi mobile qu'avant.
- On arrive d'ici deux heures.
D'accord.
Wee-Bey récolte aux tours ?
- Dans environ deux heures.
- On a le temps d'organiser ça.
Qu'est-ce qu'il a, Wallace ?
Rien.
Rien ?
Rien.
Tout va bien. Foutez-lui la paix.
Merde.
Putain.
J'en ai marre de pas avoir de téléphone.
- Je reviens.
- D'accord.
- Bonne promenade.
- Ouais.
- Allô, vous avez commandé ?
- C'est qui ?
Vous avez commandé ? Des bonnes yakame.
- Quoi ?
- Pas de livraison.
Vous commandez, vous venez chercher.
Les yakame, les nouilles.
Avec du ketchup.
C'était quoi, ça ?
C'était le commis coréen.
Ça faisait plutôt chinois.
Comme si tu pouvais faire la différence.
J'ai du travail pour vous.
1 2-14.
- Demande ŕ parler ŕ 1 2-08.
- Vas-y, 14.
08, tu passes sur le canal 3 ?
1 2-08, bien reçu.
- T'es oů ?
- McCullough, aprčs Preston.
Devant une cabine utilisée
par les mecs de la cour.
Je suis sur le toit de l'église.
Vous éloignez pas.
J'ai peut-ętre une arrestation
pour vous deux.
Vous ętes encore lŕ-dedans, vous ?
- Des échantillons par cinq.
- C'est quoi, comme came ?
Des capsules jaunes. C'est de la balle.
- C'est de la balle.
- Regarde.
Il a plus envie de se défoncer
que de se désintoxiquer.
- Il s'en sortait bien.
- C'était n'importe quoi.
- Ces réunions, c'est de la merde.
- Il avait l'air fort, pourtant.
Peu importe.
C'est l'heure de la livraison.
- Merde.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
C'est le mec qui m'a cassé la gueule.
La came arrive, et elle est bonne,
alors rappelez-vous oů vous l'avez eue,
et dites-le ŕ vos amis toxicos.
Faites la queue, bordel.
Reculez.
Faites la queue, putain !
Poussez-vous. Allez vous faire foutre.
Dépęche-toi. Par ici.
Prends-en une, par ici. J'en ai une.
T'en as eu une ?
Attends. T'en as chopé une ?
J'en ai trois, si tu veux.
T'étais ŕ la réunion ŕ Samuel Morse.
J'ai tenu une journée. Ŕ peine.
T'es quand męme venu.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais lŕ
si tu veux pas de drogue ?
J'essaie de sortir mon neveu de la rue.
Sa mčre l'a envoyé ŕ Cumberland.
Chez ma grand-mčre, pour qu'il reste clean.
Il a pas encore touché le fond.
Il va falloir qu'il le touche pour remonter.
C'est dur parce qu'il est jeune. 24 ans.
Les gens se lassent pas avant 35 ou 40 ans.
- Quel âge as-tu ?
- Je me sens jeune.
Moi, c'est Walon.
Bubs.
Laisse-les s'éloigner un peu.
Plus tu l'arrętes loin de la cité,
moins c'est risqué pour l'écoute.
Je m'en fous, de l'écoute.
Pardon ?
Je t'ai eu, tu pars au quart de tour.
Il y a plusieurs approches.
Primo, il faut le nom
de toutes les sociétés de couverture,
des sociétés en commandite,
des S.A.R.L., etc.
- S.A.R.L. ?
- Société ŕ responsabilité limitée.
Commencez par la boîte de nuit
de Barksdale.
Cherche Chez Orlando. Grâce ŕ l'adresse,
tu retrouveras le propriétaire.
C'est sur la rue Baltimore, non ?
ARGENT
J'ai trouvé. Entreprises D & B.
Donne ça ŕ Prez. Il va se bouger le cul
et aller dans les bureaux du gouvernement,
rue Preston.
- Rue Preston ?
- Le bureau des actes constitutifs.
Le bureau de quoi ?
Toutes les sociétés par actions et S.A.R.L.
de l'État y sont enregistrées.
Tu entres Entreprises D & B
dans l'ordinateur.
Tu obtiendras un microfilm.
Qui contient l'acte constitutif.
Écris tous les noms qui y figurent .:
Ies cadres, les actionnaires et surtout,
I'agent qui a déposé l'acte,
souvent un avocat.
Męme s'ils utilisent des noms d'emprunt
en tant que cadres,
c'est le męme avocat qui dépose l'acte.
Entre le nom de cet agent dans l'ordinateur,
trouve les autres sociétés
dont il a fait le dépôt,
et on aura le nom
d'autres sociétés de couverture.
Et pendant ce temps, je fais quoi ?
Tu continues ŕ regarder dans ce registre.
Cherche toutes les propriétés
que tu peux relier ŕ Barksdale.
Comment savoir
qu'elles sont reliées ŕ Barksdale ?
Tu te sers des infos
que Prez trouve dans les actes.
Toutes les sociétés qu'il relie ŕ Barksdale
ou ŕ ses acolytes,
tu les cherches dans les archives de la Ville.
Exemple :
McNulty a entendu dire que Barksdale
était propriétaire d'un immeuble
sur Druid Park Lake.
Vérifie tous les immeubles de Reservoir Hill.
Vois si quelque chose
appartient ŕ Entreprises D & B,
ou ŕ toute autre société que Prez trouve
dans les actes constitutifs
ou autres documents.
Si tu trouves quelque chose,
note le numéro de dossier
afin de pouvoir le consulter
au Palais de Justice.
Si tu ne trouves rien,
note simplement les contrats de courtage
des immeubles du secteur.
Tu appelles Prez pour lui donner la liste,
il sort les actes,
et il essaie d'établir des liens.
- C'est une chasse au trésor.
- Et si Barksdale est prudent ?
Je veux dire,
si on ne trouve son nom nulle part ?
Dans ce pays,
Ie nom de quelqu'un
figure toujours quelque part.
Un cousin, une copine, une grand-mčre,
un lieutenant de confiance,
son nom figure quelque part.
Et souvenez-vous de ça :
dans la filičre de la drogue,
on trouve des toxicos et des dealers.
Mais dans la filičre du fric,
on ne sait pas oů ça va nous mener.
Et pendant qu'on fait tout ça,
vous faites quoi ?
- Je peux vous aider ?
- Oui.
J'aimerais consulter
Ies rapports financiers
des campagnes des quartiers ouest
et en fait, de celles de toute la ville.
Par trimestre,
ou la liste des donateurs particuliers ?
- Les deux, s'il vous plaît.
- Ça fait environ deux cents pages.
Vraiment ? Je prends tout.
C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
Passe la main droite par la fenętre
et ouvre la portičre.
- Dépęche-toi.
- Sors de la voiture.
Lâche la béquille, jette-la.
Fais le tour par-derričre.
Bien.
Tourne-toi.
Est-ce qu'on risque de trouver
quelque chose dans la caisse ?
Non.
Ni armes, ni drogue ?
J'ai que dalle.
Cet argent, lŕ,
je l'ai sorti de ta bagnole, non ?
Quel argent ?
Faudra des plombes
pour compter ces biffetons.
Vous allez oů, avec ce fric ?
Il vous l'a dit, c'est pas ŕ nous.
C'est pas ŕ vous ?
Alors on peut le prendre ?
Si vous voulez.
Vous dites l'avoir sorti de la bagnole.
Je savais męme pas qu'il y était.
Oui, je connais la rengaine.
L'autre jour,
j'ai enlevé les coussins de mon canapé,
et j'ai trouvé 1 $. Je savais pas qu'il y était.
Vous avez de quoi m'inculper ?
Non, connard, on n'a pas d'inculpation.
On a ton fric.
Si tu veux le récupérer,
explique au procureur d'oů il vient.
Bonne journée ŕ vous.
Quandje me réveille
Et queje sors du lit
Donne-m'en trois.
Quandje me réveille
Et queje sors du lit
Je pense ŕ ceux
Qui sont mortsjadis
Les frčres avec qui, enfermé, j'ai grandi
Je rappe ŕ donf, j'improvise
Patti LaBelle est belle, elle est pas mal
Mais Regina Bell, c'est de la balle
Enculé !
Enculé, t'essaies de piquer notre came.
Enculé !
- La pęche a été bonne, Bubs ?
- Oui.
T'aurais dű voir la poiscaille que j'ai ratée.
J'ai failli y laisser ma peau.
Ça fait partie du jeu, Bubbs.
Ah oui ?
C'est pas de la coke.
Moi non plus, ça me fait rien.
C'est du bicarbonate de soude
qu'on a chouré.
C'est pas grave,
je vais trouver une autre idée.
Je l'ai fait une fois, non ?
Merde.
Carv, quand tu vas dans un restaurant,
et que la serveuse te sert bien.
Combien de pourboire ?
Combien je donne ?
- Pour un bon service.
- Je sais pas, 15 %.
- Y en a qui donnent 20 %.
- Y en a qui ont du fric.
Combien donnerait Wee-Bey, ŕ ton avis ?
Tu serais pas con,
s'il y avait pas de table d'écoute.
Comment ça ?
Disons qu'on ramčne 20 000 $,
que les chefs écoutent la bande
et qu'ils entendent qu'on a sorti 30 000 $.
T'y avais pas pensé, hein ?
On trouve pas mal de trucs
dans l'ouest du centre-ville
qui sont peut-ętre ŕ lui,
dans le secteur de Howard.
- Quel genre ?
- Locaux commerciaux pas chers.
Souvent inoccupés.
Qu'est-ce qu'Avon Barksdale
veut foutre de ça ?
- Ça me semble prématuré.
- Quoi donc ?
De chercher ses biens.
On n'a rien pour l'inculper.
- Ça devrait ętre la priorité.
- Si on inculpe Avon Barksdale,
Ie préfet adjoint clôt l'affaire.
Si on veut suivre la filičre de l'argent,
c'est maintenant ou jamais.
Je travaille, moi.
Entre 20 000 $ et 30 000 $.
Des sous pour nous.
Si vous aviez vu leur tronche.
- Qu'a dit Wee-Bey ?
- "Quel argent ?"
Le seul problčme,
c'est qu'il va falloir le compter.
- Pour le service des Preuves.
- C'est que des petites coupures.
De l'argent sale de la rue.
Vous avez vu les mecs de la cour
ŕ une cabine ?
Vous avez vu les mecs de la cour
ŕ une cabine ?
- Sur McCullough.
- Vous avez des photos ?
Il va nous falloir une autorisation
pour mettre cette cabine sur écoute.
Encore 30 jours, McNulty ?
Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?
Un jour c'est la guerre, un jour il cčde.
- Il la veut, cette putain d'affaire ?
- Lâche-le, Jimmy.
Il doit affronter ses supérieurs,
sur ce coup-lŕ.
Oů est mon stylo fétiche ?
- T'es pręte, salope ?
- Oui, je suis pręte.
Je vais m'agenouiller
et te sucer comme une grosse glace.
- Ouais, suce.
- Je sais que c'est ce que tu préfčres.
Je vais te lécher. T'aimes ça ?
Je veux que tu m'encules.
On est censés couper
quand c'est pas pertinent.
Pas question, c'est trop bon.
- Baise-moi.
- Oui, c'est bon.
Pas question que je transcrive ça.
Touche-toi.
Oui.
- Ma chatte est toute mouillée.
- Téléphone porno ?
C'est ŕ mourir de rire.
T'es censé couper au bout de 90 secondes
si c'est pas pertinent.
Tu vas ętre couverte de sperme, tu sais ça ?
Vraiment ?
Je vais venir
et te baiser dans les trois trous.
- Alors, tu vas venir ?
- Demain, oui.
Ce soir, il faut quej'aille rue Argyle.
- Voir Wallace.
- Wallace ?
Il disjoncte depuis qu'on a aidé
le gang de la tour
ŕ buter le voleur. Je te dis, Wallace est mal.
Il sort męme plus de sa piaule.
- Pourquoi ?
- Je crois qu'il se défonce.
- Wallace ?
- Il me fait peur, avec ses conneries.
- Rappelle-moi plus tard.
- Ça marche.
C'est pertinent, finalement.
Si tu peux expliquer
pourquoi on écoute toujours
aprčs 10 minutes de branlette.
Il faudra le justifier.
Trois trous,
c'était peut-ętre le code pour trois planques.
Omar.
Omar arrive.
- Vous avez entendu ? Omar arrive.
- Tirons-nous.
Il y a Omar qui débarque.
Ça sent le roussi. Barrons-nous.
Laisse-moi entrer,
ou je souffle sur ta maison.
Attention, je suis le grand méchant loup.
Omar, tu ferais mieux de te tirer.
On a un MAC-10.
Je crois pas, Terrell, je crois pas.
Vous devriez y réfléchir,
et arręter de me faire perdre mon temps.
Parce qu'Omar peut revenir demain.
Et aprčs-demain.
Et ainsi de suite.
Et vous coller un pruneau chacun,
vous avez entendu ?
Sage décision.
Gardez la monnaie.
On la joue comment ?
Fermement, on ne lui donne pas le choix.
- Shardene Ennis.
- Nous devons vous parler.
- Ŕ quel propos ?
- Veuillez nous suivre.
Par ici. Venez.
Donne-moi deux capsules.
- Ça va ?
- Qu'est-ce que t'as ?
Pour la famille, c'est deux pour un.
T'en veux ?
- Non. Pas moi.
- D'accord.
On se demande comment ces petits galets
atterrissent sur le toit.
Oů sont-ils tous passés ?
Peut-ętre que tout est fini,
et que personne nous l'a dit.
On a peut-ętre gagné.
Y a quelque chose qui cloche.
Viens, on va faire un tour.
C'est joli, ça.
- J'adore les meubles miniatures.
- Pour les maisons de poupées.
C'est un passe-temps.
Ma soeur en avait une
quand on était petites, mais...
on n'avait rien d'aussi beau. Je peux ?
Bien sűr.
C'est une coiffeuse en noisetier,
dessus en marbre.
Renouveau de la Renaissance,
fin du XIXe sičcle.
Vous avez une maison pour les mettre ?
Non, je les fabrique et je les vends.
C'est un peu triste.
Vous devriez avoir une maison
pour les mettre.
On peut aller dans le bureau du lieutenant.
- Non.
- J'ai rien demandé.
Salut, Tasha. Tu es devenue trop jolie.
Rentre, Tash.
Je songe ŕ me désintoxiquer.
Ŕ nouveau.
Je me disais, j'ai nulle part oů aller,
alors peut-ętre...
C'était pas une bonne idée ?
J'ai eu tort ? Désolé.
Je suis désolé.
Attends.
N'utilise que la porte arričre.
Il y a un vieux canapé au sous-sol.
Je te donnerai des couvertures.
Si tu essaies de monter, j'appelle la police.
Je te jure que je le ferai.
Le quartier ouest est en vacances.
Pas de dealers dans les pavillons,
ni dans les tours.
C'est quoi, ce bordel ?
- Qui joue contre qui ?
- L'ouest contre l'est.
- De Baltimore ?
- Les cités, mec.
C'est la fierté des cités qui est en jeu.
La cité a une équipe de basket ?
Depuis quand travaillez-vous
Chez Orlando ?
- Quatre ou cinq mois.
- Ça vous plaît ?
- Ça paie le loyer.
- Vous devez en voir, des choses.
Comment ça ?
Il y a plein de trafiquants.
Il se passe des trucs.
Je sais rien, je travaille pour les pourboires.
- Les pourboires ?
- Oui, des verres.
Je me sape comme eux. C'est tout.
Il y a des filles qui se cament
et allez savoir quoi d'autre.
Certaines emmčnent des mecs
dans les chambres,
mais moi, je reste au bar.
Mlle Ennis,
c'est rare qu'on demande ŕ des gens
de nous suivre sans chef d'inculpation.
Sans leur dire de quoi on va parler.
Et qui obéissent sans broncher.
- Ça n'arrive que trčs rarement.
- Voire jamais.
- Vous devez avoir vos raisons.
- Les gérants de Chez Orlando
ont assassiné environ 1 2 personnes
en un an.
Ils contrôlent la drogue
dans tous les immeubles
qui se trouvent ŕ l'ouest
de Martin Luther King.
Je sais rien,
je travaille juste pour les pourboires.
Maintenant, vous savez,
puisqu'on vous le dit.
Vous connaissez Keisha Michaels ?
- Elle danse avec moi.
- Comment va-t-elle ?
J'imagine qu'elle va bien.
Voulez-vous nous excuser un instant ?
- Qu'est-ce que t'en penses ?
- C'est un coeur d'artichaut.
Si on la pousse un peu, elle cédera.
Tu veux lui montrer les photos ?
Je vais faire mieux que ça.
Allez, en défense.
- Allez !
- En défense, mec.
- C'est qui ?
- C'est Marcus Rivera.
Il vient du lycée Lake Clifton.
Il a joué en ltalie, et tout.
Slim. C'est quoi, ça ?
Tu vas dégoter tes jokers en Europe ?
Non, il est chez lui, ici.
Et toi, tu vas bien dégoter des joueurs
dans les lycées.
Il est de l'Eastside, de Dunbar.
Le playboy.
Qu'est-ce que tu fous avec ce costard ?
Il fait 30 degrés, et tu te la joues Pat Riley.
Il faut avoir l'air crédible, connard.
Tu te balades avec ton faux bloc-notes.
Tu sais męme pas lire.
Faites pas semblant. Bande de putes.
- Allez.
- Joli coup.
Il parlait ŕ Dieu, non ?
Vous ętes pas censés bosser ?
- Et toi ?
- On fait une pause.
Nous aussi. C'est quoi, ce match ?
On fait ça tous les ans.
L'Eastside contre le Westside.
Le perdant paie la traite
ŕ Druid Hill le week-end prochain.
- Les favoris ?
- L'Eastside a gagné les 2 derničres années.
Allez, les mecs.
Trouvée nue lundi matin dans une benne,
sur la route Reisterstown, aprčs Northern.
Les analyses révčlent
la présence d'héroďne et de cocaďne.
- Dans une benne ?
- Roulée dans un tapis.
Elle a fait une overdose
et celui qui était avec elle
I'a jetée comme une ordure.
C'est comme ça qu'ils font.
Traces de sperme
dans les cavités vaginales, anales et orales.
Trois groupes sanguins différents,
tous sécréteurs.
Ils l'ont baisée et jetée.
Si on sait qui elle était, ce qu'elle faisait,
et ce qu'elle pouvait représenter pour vous,
c'est parce qu'on surveille
Ies patrons de Chez Orlando
depuis un moment.
On a des moyens de savoir ce qu'ils disent,
ce qu'ils pensent.
Vous savez ce qu'ils ont dit sur elle ?
Que cette conne ne savait pas que la coke
était aussi bonne chez Little Man.
Que c'était de sa faute.
C'est comme ça qu'ils font.
Ils se servent des gens,
et quand ils les jettent,
ils se déchargent de toute responsabilité.
Ce sale menteur. Il avait dit
qu'ils l'avaient emmenée ŕ l'hôpital.
Retournez en défense.
Regarde Avon. Il est ŕ donf.
Merde, il faut qu'on gagne.
Je crois qu'Avon est ici.
- Oů ?
- Comme si je savais ŕ quoi il ressemble.
C'est un Black qui est du côté de Westside.
On a peut-ętre localisé Avon.
Un match de basket ŕ Cloverdale.
- Oů sont Greggs et Freamon ?
- Ils cuisinent l'effeuilleuse.
Carver et vous, restez en contact.
- On devrait le suivre.
- Pourquoi ?
Il ne touchera pas ŕ la drogue
ou l'argent en public, lieutenant.
Chez les Stups, on suit les gens.
C'est comme ça qu'on travaille.
On y va.
Ça fait trois mois qu'on est sur ce type.
Tu veux pas savoir ŕ quoi il ressemble ?
Je ne reconnaîtrais pas Avon Barksdale
dans la rue.
Ça sert ŕ rien.
On le chope par la voix, ou pas du tout.
Ouais, mon grand !

Tu t'es trouvé un bon joueur.
C'est pas ton année, on dirait.
- Ça en a l'air, mais on sait jamais.

Peut-ętre, mais...
j'ai une proposition ŕ te faire.
- D'accord.
- On double la mise.
On passe ŕ six chiffres.
T'es sérieux ? Je m'en fous. C'est ton fric.

C'est qui, ce nain ?
Vire-moi ce nain, mon pote.
Appel reçu
- Pourquoi tu m'appelles ?
- Il faut qu'on en finisse.
- C'est moi qui décide.
- Ça, c'est la planque.
Ah oui ?

C'est quoi ?
L'arbitre, c'est quoi, ce délire ?
Il y a eu faute. C'est clair, non ?
Tu vas rien dire ?
Si vous voulez,
on peut rejouer cette période.
Tu veux qu'ils rejouent ?
Qu'ils rejouent, putain ?
C'est pas comme ça que ça marche !
Ça se fait pas !
Vous y croyez, vous ? Il veut qu'ils rejouent.
- Je ne veux pas d'ennuis.
- Y aura pas d'ennuis.
T'es pas censé ętre l'arbitre, non ?
Pourquoi tu te défends pas ?
Espčce de mauviette.
Faut pas te laisser intimider, tu piges ?
Maintenant, tire-toi.
Tourne-toi et dégage.
Putain d'ignorant.
- Tout va bien ?
- Oui, tout va bien.
Dis ŕ tes amis de venir au parc samedi midi.
Par contre, si tu te pointes sans ballon
dans le Westside,
je t'explose.
- D'Angelo ?
- Vous le connaissez ?
J'en ai presque l'impression.
On a emménagé ensemble.
Il avait l'air différent.
- Il faut que je démissionne.
- Oui. Mais pas tout de suite.
On a besoin de vous.
C'est pour ça qu'on vous a contactée.
- Je ne vois pas ce...
- Keisha n'était pas la premičre.
Sauf intervention d'un tiers,
elle ne sera pas la derničre non plus.
Il vous plaît ?
Gardez-le.
Merci.
- Il monte dans une Ford Excursion noire.
- Bien reçu.
Il prend Collington, direction nord.
Il prend Collington, direction nord.

1 1-71, je le vois.
Il a pris Oliver, direction est.
Il vient de se garer. Ŕ l'est d'Oliver.

1 1-71, postez-vous sur Federal,
ŕ l'ouest de Montford.
J'arrive du sud.

Il ne bouge pas.
- Il fait demi-tour.
- Reçu.
Il va vers le sud sur Montford.
PAS DE VIRAGES AU FEU ROUGE
Il a grillé le feu de Preston et Milton,
il va vers le sud sur Milton.
Sachez qu'il n'est pas allé
jusqu'ŕ la rue Chase.
1 1-71, quelle est votre position ?
Il a pas pu passer devant nous.
11-71, rien de ce côté.
Il a dű sortir de sa voiture.
Gardez vos positions. Je vais voir.
- Il a encore appelé, de la męme cabine.
- La męme voix ?
C'était forcément la planque principale.
Ça correspond.
- Qui a pris l'appel ŕ la cité ?
- Je l'ignore.
Y avait personne sur le toit.
Sydnor était avec Daniels,
ŕ suivre Avon dans la rue.
Bonne journée pour nous aussi.
Kima a converti
une danseuse du club d'Avon.
Celle qui se tape D'Angelo.
Ce type est fort. On a tout essayé.
Vous savez ce qu'on dit :
les criminels cons font des flics cons.
Vous savez ce qu'on dit :
les criminels cons font des flics cons.
Je suis fier de poursuivre ce type.
Pour l'instant, on a quatre
sociétés de couverture, des trucs variés.
Un club, un immeuble,
une maison funéraire,
et beaucoup de propriétés dans l'ouest
du centre-ville, dans le secteur de Howard.
Des locaux commerciaux et des entrepôts.
- Au nom de Barksdale ?
- Des noms d'emprunt. Et de sa famille.
Je peux m'asseoir ?
Il deale dans la cité depuis plus d'un an,
une vraie manne.
L'autre jour,
on a chopé Wee-Bey avec 22 000 $.
On a entendu sur la bande
que c'était pas une grosse perte.
22 000 $ ?
C'est une matinée dans les tours
et dans la cour.
Si on ajoute les coins de rue,
on avoisine les 30 000 $.
Plus une autre ronde le soir, ça fait 60 000 $.
- Par jour ?
- Ça fait au minimum 25 millions par an.
Moins 20 % pour les dépenses courantes
et les pertes,
ça fait quand męme 1 million par mois.
- Oů va le fric ?
- Il ne flambe pas.
Il n'a ni maison ni voiture ŕ son nom,
ni bijoux, ni fringues.
Que des sociétés de couverture
et des propriétés.
Et des contributions politiques.
75 000 $ pour le mois dernier seulement,
qui proviennent des sociétés de couverture
ou de leurs cadres.
Et ce n'est qu'un survol.
Ce n'est que le total
des contributions légales.
Il y a Damien Price,
l'assistant d'un sénateur,
qui siffle 20 000 $ en liquide de la cité
quand ça lui chante.
Vous n'allez pas aimer ça, lieutenant,
mais la filičre de l'argent
est réelle et tentaculaire.
Et davantage que la drogue,
c'est l'argent qui compte.
J'ai baisé avec personne d'autre,
si c'est ce que tu crois.
Et puis merde.
Si tu veux te barrer, barre-toi !
Mais dis-moi au moins pourquoi.
- Je ressemble ŕ quoi, pour toi ?
- Comment ça ?
- Je ressemble ŕ quoi, pour toi ?
- Ŕ une fille, une femme,
une belle femme, tu es jolie, quoi ?
Je ne ressemble pas ŕ une ordure ?
Chérie, ça compte pas, ce que tu fais.
Je ressemble pas ŕ un truc
qu'on roule dans un tapis
et qu'on jette aux ordures ?
Shardene.
Vous nous avez bipés ?
On était presque arrivés.
Asseyez-vous.
- Ouais ? J'ai recompté.
- Alors ?
C'est pas si mal.
- On s'est fait chourer environ 22 000 $.
- 22 000 $ ? C'est tout ?
D'accord.
J'ai le fric des tours 2, 3, 5 et 6,
et une liasse avec "C", pour la cour.
Oů est le fric des tours 1 et 4 ?
Sur la bande, ils parlent de 22 000 $.
Vous avez rapporté 15 000 $, petits cons.
Oů est le reste ?
- Lieutenant, on n'a pas...
- Vous avez jusqu'ŕ demain matin
pour rapporter ce qui manque.
Le fric revient et va aux Preuves.
Ça se passe pas comme ça.
Pas chez moi. Pas dans mon unité.
J'aurais rien piqué sans te le dire.
Sucre Domino
C'est ŕ Avon, ça.
Avon Barksdale
te cherche dans toute la ville,
et tu trouves le temps de lui piquer sa came.
- Maintenant, c'est la tienne.
- J'en fais quoi ?
Les gens en font quoi, d'aprčs toi ?
- T'en veux combien ?
- C'est gratuit.
Gratuit ?
J'ai une proposition ŕ te faire.
Contre 40 000 $ de came gratos,
tu m'aides ŕ trouver Avon.
- Ŕ le contacter ?
- Vous venez de disputer une partie, non ?
- Comment tu fais pour lui parler ?
- On se parle de temps en temps.
Je le bipe.
D'accord.
C'est tout ce qu'il te faut ?
- Un numéro ?
- Je saurai m'en servir.
Et le code d'un de ses hommes.
C'est 07, pour Wee-Bey ?
07.
Qu'est-ce qui te faire croire
que je vais pas prendre la came
et te foutre dehors ?
Si Avon tombe, la cité est ŕ toi, non ?
Que je comprenne bien.
Avon perd 100 000 $ dans un pari,
et toi, tu m'apportes sa came
pour que je te le laisse en pâture.
C'est pas sa journée.
Merde.
Laisse tomber.
- C'était oů ?
- Dans le passage de roue.
Tu te rappelles quand le sac s'est déchiré ?
Daniels va y croire, d'aprčs toi ?
T'y croirais, toi ?
Tu ne m'as pas cru.
Je suis désolé.
Savino est ŕ la bourre.
Je veux déposer le fric et me casser.
- T'es fatigué ?
- Je suis fatigué, j'ai faim.
Merde, moi aussi.
Tu veux un truc du resto ?
Ouais, t'y vas ?
Prends-moi un sandwich viande-fromage.
- Et toi ?
- Je me ferais bien un hamburger.
D'accord.
- Avec des oignons.
- Pas de problčme.
Classe-les bien.
Les 50 $ avec les 50 $
et les 100 $ avec les 100 $.
Bonsoir, mesdames.
Ŕ demain, et soyez ŕ l'heure.
Compte le fric.
- Quoi ?
- C'est qui ?
Wee-Bey m'envoie un appel d'urgence.
Merde.
Ouais.
Appel d'urgence.
Non. On a établi des rčgles.
Merde.
Il y avait des frites au fromage.
Je t'en ai pris.
Avon, reste baissé. Je te couvre.
C'est la deuxième fois de la semaine
que je paie une baby-sitter
parce qu'il travaille tard.
Avec tout l'argent qu'il gagne,
tu peux te le permettre.
Putain.
Comment ça va, Bubs ?
Salut.
Et voilà.
- Qu'est-ce que t'as ?
- Des petites doses.

"Et il a lâché les menottes..."
-- Greggs
C'est ma faute.
- J'aurais jamais dû te laisser tout seul.
- Sans déconner.
Si t'étais pas arrivé, je serais mort.
Ce que je veux savoir, c'est comment on va
lui rendre la monnaie de sa pièce.
On ne fait rien. Pas pour l'instant.
Tu piges ?
Écoute, Stringer, t'as eu une bonne idée,
tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
Je veux que tu le saches.
Mais je veux que tu fasses passer le mot.
Qu'il sache qu'on est prêts à enterrer ça,
s'il veut bien.
Et s'il est pas d'accord ?
Non, on vit dans la même ville.
Il écoutera, si on négocie.
Et quand il sortira de son trou.
- Boum.
- C'est ça.
- On l'éclate.
- N'en dis pas plus.
- Fais passer le mot.
- D'accord.
Les flics t'ont suivi après le match ?
Ouais, il y avait deux bagnoles.
S'ils te suivent, c'est qu'ils ont ton nom.
Et s'ils ont ton nom,
ils savent que t'as pas de permis.
Mais c'est pas le code de la route
qui les intéresse.
Ils veulent un gros coup.
Je pense qu'ils voulaient voir où j'allais.
Où est-ce que tu les as emmenés ?
Chez le coiffeur.
J'allais me faire couper les cheveux.
Tu t'es fait raser ?
Ouais, n'empêche que ces connards
nous collent au cul. Merde.
Ils ont toujours été là,
il suffit de faire attention.
Tu parles pas au téléphone.
Tu touches pas à la came.
Et à partir de maintenant,
tu ne transportes plus d'argent.
Bey et moi, on va s'en occuper
jusqu'à ce que les choses se calment.
- Donne-moi ton pager.
- T'es sérieux ?
Oui. Je vais te donner un numéro
pour les fournisseurs de New York.
Si les mecs du coin
veulent te parler, ils devront passer par moi.
Il faut construire un mur autour de toi.
Un mois de plus
sur un nouveau téléphone ?
Ils ont bousillé les cabines des pavillons.
Maintenant, ils vont ailleurs.
Dans combien de temps
vous allez clore l'enquête ?
Le plus vite sera le mieux.
Pour tout le monde, toi y compris.
Regarde-moi ça. Le juge Gwynn s'excuse.
On ne déjeunera pas ensemble.
Comme si j'avais la peste.
Voici ton nouveau téléphone. 30 jours.
Quand Burrell a voulu arrêter les écoutes,
la dernière fois,
c'est toi qui l'as pris aux couilles.
Jimmy, on est avec une dame.
Rhonda est bien pire que nous,
Votre Honneur.
Je me suis toujours bien comportée,
Votre Honneur.
McNulty fait un effort particulier
pour insulter un officier de la Cour.
- Je te colle un outrage à magistrat.
- Ça ne m'étonne pas.
SILENCE - PROCÉS EN COURS
Qu'est-ce qu'il a ?
- T'es pas au courant ?
- Non.
- Où est l'erreur ?
- Je ne sais pas.
COLLECTE DE FONDS
JUGES D'INSTRUCTION
- Phelan n'y est pas.
- Quoi, il doit se faire réélire ?
Les juges sont élus pour 15 ans, non ?
Oui, mais Phelan a été nommé
pour remplacer Halpern
qui n'avait plus que deux ans.
Donc il doit se présenter aux primaires.
Il n'est pas affilié à un parti ?
Pourquoi pas ?
C'est peut-être
ses mauvaises fréquentations.
Putain.
Tu penses pas à l'espace
dont le bébé va avoir besoin.
Surtout quand il va grandir.
Y a des trucs dont on va avoir besoin.
Un lit d'enfant, un tapis d'éveil,
et il va lui falloir
une petite voiture automatique.
Je veux pas dire
que ton appart est pas bien.
Pour toi, ça va,
mais si on décide de vivre en famille,
Pour toi, ça va,
mais si on décide de vivre en famille,
il nous faut une ou deux chambres de plus.
On rajoute des jolis meubles,
comme ceux qu'ils ont
à la boutique pour bébés de la rue Howard,
et ça fait une chambre.
Et on pourrait acheter
des meubles plus jolis
et mettre tes trucs dans l'autre chambre,
pour en faire un genre de salon,
parce que ton canapé
a vu des jours meilleurs.
T'as dû t'en apercevoir.
Dee, où tu vas ?
Je t'ai dit que j'avais besoin d'argent
pour les meubles. Dee !
- Pourquoi tu m'appelles ?
- On n'a plus grand-chose.
J'arrive quandje peux.
C'est la planque principale.
Quoi ?
Le type qui appelle est le principal
fournisseur du gang de Barksdale.
- C'est qui ?
- On ne sait pas.
Alors, vous supposez juste
qu'il s'occupe de la came ?
Non, c'est sûr.
Lester regardait le registre des appels
quand il a compris le système.
Chaque fois
qu'il leur reste plus trop de came,
un type de la tour appelle ce pager.
Et chaque fois, dans la demi-heure qui suit,
un numéro de Pimlico
rappelle la cabine de la tour.
Quel numéro ?
Celui d'une cabine du supermarché
de Cold Spring Lane à Reisterstown.
Tu vois ?
Quand l'approvisionnement baisse,
ils bipent ce truand
qui rappelle toujours
d'une cabine du nord-ouest.
Même téléphone, même schéma.
Il prend la commande
de réapprovisionnement
et la planque est près du supermarché,
c'est ça ?
- À toi de le découvrir, Sydnor.
- Bon, qu'est-ce que vous allez faire ?
Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
On va surveiller ce téléphone à Pimlico
nuit et jour en attendant M. Supermarché.
- Herc aussi.
- Il est absent cette semaine.
- Il fait une formation.
- Dommage.
Au lieu de faire huit heures de service,
vous allez devoir en faire 1 2.
C'est ça, tuez-moi tout de suite.
- Des nouvelles d'Omar ?
- Non.
Je vais essayer de le trouver. Tu seras où ?
Tout le monde sur la bande d'écoute raconte
que le gamin est traumatisé
par la mort du voleur.
- Je vais aller voir.
- D'accord.
- Si t'as besoin de nous, fais un appel radio.
- Bien.
Ça gaze ?
Vu qu'on se connaît pas,
je vais prendre 100 g de crack,
mais si c'est du bon,
j'en prendrai plus la prochaine fois.
Pour 100 g, ça vaut pas vraiment le coup.
C'est juste pour voir.
Si tu me sers bien,
je reviendrai en acheter plus.
Fais voir ta thune.
C'est bon.
Alors, où est la came ?
Y a personne d'autre que toi.
Personne d'autre n'est venu chez moi.
Tout le monde.
Personne d'autre.
T'es le seul à être venu chez moi.
Alors, qu'est-ce que t'as ?
Il me reste plus rien, j'ai tout brûlé.
Ta famille ?
Ma mère est morte.
Dieu sait où est mon père.
Des frères et soeurs ?
Une soeur, elle me laisse son sous-sol,
mais elle ferme à clé pour que je monte pas.
Elle ne pourrait rien faire de mieux.
J'ai un fils.
Imagine-moi donner la vie.
- Comment il s'appelle ?
- Keyshawn.
Sa mère l'a emmené dans le New Jersey,
elle voulait pas que je le voie.
- Je la comprends.
- Eh bien...
au moins, t'as la santé.
À la santé !
J'ai le sida.
Depuis 1994.
Je l'ai refilé à ma copine.
J'ai eu peur que ma gamine l'ait aussi.
Au moins, c'est pas arrivé.
Putain, comment tu vis ça ?
- Tu lui as demandé pardon ?
- Bien sûr.
- Qu'est-ce qu'elle a dit ?
- Ce qu'elle avait à dire.
Écoute, le pardon des gens, c'est bien,
mais c'est que des mots
qui viennent de l'extérieur.
Si tu veux gagner,
il faut que tu te pardonnes à toi-même.
Aime-toi un peu, mon pote.
Et ramène ton cul aux réunions.
- Aux réunions ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu veux entendre ?
Que t'es assez fort
pour t'en sortir tout seul ?
Décrocher, c'est le plus facile.
Après, il y a la vie.
Celle-là, avec la rallonge orange
qui sort à l'arrière.
Ils piquent l'électricité d'à côté.
Sans déconner. Je fais la police
pour la compagnie d'électricité ?
Ils ne sont pas encore là,
mais quand ce gamin arrive, arrêtez-le.
On squatte devant ce taudis à attendre
qu'un petit mec des cités se pointe ?
Ma mère m'a bien élevé.
Quatre gâteaux au crabe de chez Faidley
dans le sac,
et un pack de 24 bières.
De chez Faidley ? T'assures, McNulty.
De chez Faidley ? T'assures, McNulty.
Les connards du centre-ville
pourront dire ce qu'ils veulent.
1 1-35, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Notre ami veut nous voir. Même endroit.
- Reçu. Dans 15 mn.
- C'est quoi l'histoire, avec le gamin ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'il a fait ?
- Il est entré dans ma vie.
- Cinq minutes, allez.
- Je dois y aller.
- Shardene.
- Je dois y aller, j'ai dit.
- Même pas cinq minutes ?
- Non, pas maintenant.
Chez Orlando - Club pour Messieurs
Merde !
T'as failli l'avoir ?
Ce mec serait mort si Wee-Bey
s'était pas pointé à la dernière minute.
Tu te souviens de la dernière fois ?
Tu devais te tenir à carreau,
nous laisser bosser.
J'ai dit que je ferais de mon mieux.
Mais j'ai pensé que je vous dirais
que les types d'Avon
m'ont fait savoir qu'ils voulaient une trêve.
- Ils m'ont offert un genre d'amnistie.
- Une amnistie ?
Si j'arrête d'essayer de les buter
et de les arnaquer
pour leur came, ils enlèvent la mise à prix.
Accepte la trêve, Omar.
Peut-être, s'ils essaient pas de me niquer.
- Ils ont dit qu'ils voulaient négocier.
- Négocier ?
Écoutez, je sais pas,
mais là, j'ai besoin de votre aide.
Si je vais aux urgences
et qu'Avon apprend ça,
vous savez qu'il va envoyer ses hommes
de main m'attendre sur le parking.
Je sais que vous avez
des potes médecins, hein ?
Il dit qu'il peut acheter de grosses
quantités, qu'il bosse avec des pointures.
- Comme qui ?
- Avon... Barksdale.
Avon Barksdale ?
Vérifie les bases de données
et vois ce qui en ressort.
Je vais aller voir si quelqu'un enquête
sur les noms que t'as donnés.
Si c'est bidon, je le saurai rapidement.
Et moi, je fais quoi, en attendant ?
Direction rue Eager. En prison, mon pote.
Blue est passé la semaine dernière.
Je l'ai pas revu depuis.
Oui.
Incroyable.
- Putain, Carv, t'es immonde.
- J'admets, je suis dégueulasse.
Des chips au fromage
et des gâteaux à la crème ?
Ouais.
- Oui.
- Le gros type de la tour,
- comment il s'appelle ?
- Little Man.
- Oui, lui.
- D'accord.
- Oui.
- Sois prêt. C'est le moment.
Regardez comme il est mignon.
Trop bourré
pour rentrer chez vous, McNulty ?
Bunk.
Ce gamin nous a donné un meurtre.
Mieux que ça, il a impliqué Stringer Bell.
Ah ouais ?
Il a désigné Wee-Bey,
Bird et Stinkum sur photos.
Ils étaient tous chez le Grec
Ie soir du meurtre du copain d'Omar.
Il a aussi identifié Bell dans la bagnole.
Il a dit : "Stringer m'a dit
de désigner le voleur."
- Qu'est-ce que t'as sur lui ?
- Que dalle.
Il était mûr, j'ai à peine eu à le pousser.
- Qui est sur l'affaire ?
- Norris.
- Il a quel âge ?
- 16 ans.
Il squatte un taudis de la rue Argyle.
Quand je l'ai chopé, il piquait du nez.
Un junkie ?
Après avoir tué le voleur,
ils ont laissé le corps dans la ruelle,
juste à côté de là
où le gamin et ses potes squattent.
T'imagines ?
Il ne pense qu'à ça.
Tu lui as dit qu'il devra témoigner ?
Pas encore, on y viendra. Le problème,
c'est qu'est-ce qu'on fait de lui ?
- Oui.
- Le gros décroche.
Bien.
- Tu m'as appelé, hein ?
- T'es où ? On n'a plus grand-chose.
Demain à la première heure.
- Oui ?
- C'est lui, suis-le.
D'accord.
J'ai rien fait. Laissez-moi sortir.
La balle atterrit en troisième base,
ça passe dejustesse.
Et mon coup de téléphone ?
Et c'est au tour de Suzuki de lancer,
il est sur le marbre.
C'est un bon coup, qui permet à Suzuki
d'atteindre la première base.
Suzuki prend toujours son temps
quand il lance.
Ouais, c'est moi.
Devine qui est ici.
Cet enculé d'Orlando, du club.
Ouais. En face de moi.
PROPRlÉTÉ PRIVÉE - DÉFENSE D'ENTRER
- T'as commencé à vendre quand ?
- Quand j'avais 1 2 ans.
Depuis quand tu bosses
pour le gang de Barksdale ?
Avec D'Angelo ? Pas longtemps.
Il a quitté les tours au début de l'été.
Avant, je travaillais pour Ronnie Mo.
Est-ce que D'Angelo t'a parlé
de ce qui est arrivé au 221 ?
Du meurtre de Pooh ?
Ou quelque chose du genre ?
- Comme quoi ?
- Des assassinats, des meurtres.
Il a parlé d'une fille qui s'est fait tuer
dans un appart du quartier est ?
Il...
Non, Dee était cool avec moi.
Mais c'est lui que t'as appelé
le soir où t'as vu
Ie voleur chez le Grec, non ?
Oui, mais il n'y est pas allé.
C'était surtout des mecs des tours.
Et Stringer.
T'as dit que Stringer était dans la voiture.
Il t'a appelé
et t'a demandé de lui désigner le voleur.
Tout ça est confirmé
par le registre des pagers
et les enregistreurs de numéros
des cabines des cités.
Stinkum est mort.
On a déjà Bird pour le meurtre de Gant.
- Ça les implique tous.
- D'Angelo y compris.
Peut-être,
mais comme il est pas allé chez le Grec,
il dira au jury
qu'il avait pas vu le meurtre venir.
Mais ça suffit pour l'inculper.
Ses parents ?
Une mère alcoolique, sans domicile fixe.
Il a une grand-mère
sur la rive est du Maryland,
il l'a pas vue depuis longtemps.
- Une chambre d'hôtel ?
- Aux frais de qui ?
L'adjoint n'acceptera jamais
les frais de planque d'un ado,
sans parler de sa bouffe.
McNulty, ligne 2.
Et si on demandait à ton bureau ?
Le procureur participera peut-être.
C'est un gamin, Cedric.
Même si on trouve l'argent,
tu veux vraiment mettre un mineur
à l'hôtel pendant six mois
en attendant le procès ?
Je pense qu'il faut contacter la grand-mère.
Maintenant ? Elle fait ça en ce moment ?
Il ne faut pas fixer une date d'audience
ou un truc comme ça ?
Putain, oui, d'accord. Oui.
J'ai besoin d'un avocat.
Quoi ?
Quand même,
ils ont des barreaux de sécurité,
et regarde là.
Des caméras qui surveillent le jardin
et jusque dans la rue.
J'ai appelé la compagnie de téléphone.
Pas de numéro à cette adresse.
Ça, c'est un signe.
On essaie d'obtenir un mandat
de perquisition pour cette maison ?
- Qu'est-ce que tu vois ?
- Aucun lien logique.
À part ce groupement de vieilles boutiques
et d'entrepôts dans l'ouest du centre-ville.
Autour des rues Paca, Utah et Howard.
- Des boutiques ?
- Vides, en général.
Trois sociétés différentes.
- Pryzbylewski.
- Quoi ?
Tu as un don pour les indices sur papier.
Mais demain, tu vas participer
à une descente. Tu es prêt ?
Le lieutenant m'a mis à la paperasse.
Pas de flingue jusqu'au jury d'accusation.
- T'en auras pas besoin.
- Dans la rue, sans flingue ?
Pas de flingue. Ce sera inutile.
De plus, M. McNulty,
après s'être servi de ses fils
pour une enquête policière
impliquant un suspect criminel,
Ies a perdus dans la foule
d'un marché municipal.
C'est tout simplement inacceptable,
Votre Honneur.
Cependant,
une ordonnance ex parte d'urgence
est une requête extraordinaire, M. Palmer.
Vous voulez limiter les visites
aux seuls après-midi, et vous voulez
que Mme McNulty y soit toujours présente ?
Voyons.
Ce n'est pas qu'un écart de conduite,
Madame le juge.
M. McNulty échoue continuellement
à s'occuper de ses enfants
Iorsqu'ils sont sous sa garde.
J'ai une liste de faits récents,
Votre Honneur, qui justifie l'ordonnance.
Mme Pearlman,
avez-vous une proposition à nous faire ?
Non.
Rien ?
Pour une possession avec intention
de vendre, j'aurais une ligne d'attaque.
Mais pour une affaire familiale ?
Votre Honneur, je suis désarmée.
À vrai dire, vu mon statut,
je ne devrais pas être ici.
Bien, écoutez,
avant de m'obliger à statuer
sur une demande en urgence,
que tout le monde inspire profondément.
Vraiment, allez.
Bon, M. McNulty est-il capable
d'avoir une conversation polie
avec Mme McNulty ?
Oui, Votre Honneur.
Mme McNulty est-elle aussi capable
d'avoir une conversation avec M. McNulty ?
- Oui.
- Bon, alors je vais déjeuner.
À mon retour,
on verra si ce tribunal peut servir
à régler des problèmes plus graves
que ceux des McNulty.
J'accepte l'inculpation.
Je comprends et j'assume.
Mais au moins, nos amis
pourraient lâcher quelque chose
pour la caution.
Voici l'acte de cession pour le club.
Ça, c'est un formulaire de transfert
pour le registre des Alcools.
Ils sont tous antidatés et notariés
de la semaine dernière.
Quoi ?
Une couverture se doit d'être légale.
Et à l'instant, vous ne l'êtes pas. Signez.
Je veux qu'on paie ma caution.
Envoyez-moi un garant et je signe.
C'est ça que vous voulez que je lui dise ?
Que vous avez refusé de signer ?
Vous vouliez faire partie du jeu, hein ?
Eh bien, maintenant, vous y êtes.
Incroyable. Tu t'es pointé avec elle ?
Elena, tu as choisi un ex parte en urgence.
J'ai pris l'avocat que j'avais sous la main.
Sous la main ? Demande-lui
si elle veut récupérer les photos.
Voyons, j'ai celle au resto
où tu lui avances sa chaise.
Celle dans le parking du motel
où tu lui ouvres la portière de la voiture,
parce que t'es galant, maintenant.
C'est dingue que t'aies embauché Buckman.
Ce connard n'a jamais
établi de dossier solide.
Il t'a chopé en train de me tromper.
Elena, pourquoi on est ici ?
Parce que je ne veux pas que Sean
et Michael s'approchent de criminels.
Je ne veux pas que tu les perdes
dans un marché de Baltimore.
Ce n'était pas un criminel.
Je le connais. C'était juste un jeu.
De jour, dans une rue animée.
Ils auraient aussi bien pu suivre AI Capone.
Y aurait pas eu de problème.
Elena, ce sont mes fils.
Je les aime. T'entends ? Je les aime.
Je ne laisserai personne leur faire du mal.
Et je t'aime aussi.
Je t'aime encore.
Elle est au courant,
pour le détective et les photos ?
Non, pourquoi je lui en parlerais ?
Et est-ce que vous êtes encore...
Non.
Oui.
Un peu.
Allez, soyons sympas devant le juge.
D'accord.
Nous savons qu'il reste un mois
et nous n'allons pas abandonner.
Nous allons collecter plus d'argent,
en dépenser plus,
et lejour des élections,
nous serons présents
et nous encouragerons
tout le monde à voter.
T'es prêt ?
Viens, on va d'abord aller manger.
J'ai pas très faim.
Viens.
Combien t'en prenais ?
Je veux savoir si tu vas être malade
dans ma voiture.
Une dose de temps en temps.
Tu fais que sniffer ?
Ça ira mieux dans un jour ou deux. Viens.
Il va venir ou quoi ?
Il était d'accord si je garantissais
la négociation. Ce que je fais.
Évidemment, il a dit
que c'est toi qui me paierais.
Te payer ?
C'est un peu
comme de la thérapie de couple.
Je facture une heure pour dire à un con
d'apporter des fleurs à sa nana.
Et une de plus pour dire à sa salope
de lui sucer la bite de temps à autre.
Histoire de renforcer les liens du mariage.
En parlant de sucer des bites...
- On ne s'est jamais rencontrés.
- Proposition Joe.
Si tu me voles, je bute toute ta famille.
Vous êtes sous ma responsabilité,
alors dites ce que vous avez sur le coeur.
Je me casse.
Je connais un type qui va te rendre ta vie.
Qui ? Barksdale ?
Il m'a dit : "Dis à cet enculé
"que s'il arrête de nous voler,
"on le laissera peinard."
Vous avez buté Bailey,
et puis, ce que vous avez fait à mon mec.
Vous pensez qu'après ce que vous avez fait
à Brandon, on va s'entendre ?
J'en sais rien, d'accord ?
Je suis juste le messager.
C'est ça.
Il y a eu des morts des deux côtés.
Et ça va empirer si ça continue comme ça.
Mais pour tout te dire,
y a plus de soldats d'un côté que de l'autre.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
Écoute, dis à Barksdale
qu'il va me payer ce qu'il a fait à mes potes.
Quant à la came, il faut bien vivre, non ?
Je connais pas de Barksdale.
Mais l'homme dont je parle ne se fera pas
dépouiller comme ça. Impossible.
Alors dis-lui de me filer de la thune,
et on verra.
Entre 5 000 $ et 10 000 $.
Pour ma retraite, tu vois ?
- 5 000 $ si tu te tiens tranquille.
- Envoie-moi l'argent par Joe.
Si tu passes par Joe,
tu ne verras même pas 2 000 $.
- T'as qu'à nous dire où tu es.
- Non.
On va se débrouiller autrement, d'accord ?
Je te tiendrai au courant.
Stringer Bell fait gaffe, hein ?
"Je connais pas de Barksdale."
Merde.
On le tient quand même
pour le meurtre de Brandon.
C'est déjà pas mal en une journée de travail.
J'ai fait ce que je pouvais.
T'es sûr, hein ?
Ouais, j'ai passé un été ici
quand j'avais neuf ans.
Ils t'ont vu quand, pour la dernière fois ?
Quand j'avais neuf ans.
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- Quoi ?
Ce bruit.
Des grillons.
- Grillon.
- Des grillons.
- Il veut encore me faire les poches ?
- Il veut 5 000 $.
Putain.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
Antwon m'a dit de monter ça.
Vous voulez autre chose ?
Non, ça va.
J'ai demandé
comment on était censés le payer.
Il a parlé de passer par Joe,
mais j'ai dit pas question.
Merci, c'est gentil.
T'es mignonne et on apprécie tes services.
Garde tes pourboires, j'espère que t'en fais.
Fais venir ce connard aux tours
Fais venir ce connard aux tours
pour recevoir le reste de son argent.
S'il est assez con pour venir,
il va se faire buter.
C'est tout. Comment on va payer ça ?
Allez.
Vous croyez avoir de la descente,
mais regardez ça.
Moi, j'ai fait une école de journalisme.
À Chicago. Alors vous n'avez
aucune chance contre moi.
Tu parles comme un vieux reporter.
- Pardon ?
- Tu bosses à la télé.
C'est exactement la même chose.
Allez, arrête de parler.
C'est reparti.
- À toi.
- Allez, Kima.
Je travaille demain.
Dégonflée.
J'ai rien d'autre à dire.
- Tu vois ?
- Je te suis.
Bravo.
Regarde Tanya.
Et elle gère une galerie d'art.
La police de cette ville est vraiment minable.
- Faut croire.
- Merci.
On ne tient pas l'alcool.
On ne tient pas les beignets.
Et d'après moi,
on n'assure pas au pieu non plus.
Ne commencez pas, inspecteur.
Kima, comment as-tu su
que tu voulais être flic ?
Je veux dire, comment t'as choisi ?
Quand t'étais petite, tu pensais à ça, ou...
Allez, Kima.
Je me souviens, quand j'étais
à l'école de police dans le nord-est.
Je ne savais pas si j'allais continuer ou non.
Et puis on a reçu un appel.
On a poursuivi un voleur à la tire
dans un immeuble.
Tout d'un coup, plus personne.
J'étais même pas dans la police.
J'étais juste stagiaire. Et j'étais seule.
Enfin, je ne sais pas comment,
mais j'ai trouvé le type.
Je l'ai chopé
et j'ai réussi à attraper ma radio.
On était en train de se battre
au milieu d'un parking,
cet enculé m'envoyait des coups
pour essayer de s'enfuir.
Soudain, j'ai vu des pompes noires
devant moi, et un pantalon d'uniforme bleu.
J'ai levé les yeux, et c'était Charlie Smoot.
Ce putain de Charlie Smoot.
Vous savez, ce mec est une légende.
Il m'a regardée et m'a souri.
Un sourire tranquille.
Il a sorti ses menottes
et m'a dit : "Tiens, bleusaille."
C'est tout ce qu'il a dit.
"Tiens, bleusaille."
Il a lâché les menottes et il est parti.
Je sais que ça te plaît pas.
Mais putain, j'étais fière.
Eh bien.
Lester dit qu'on n'aura pas de mandat
pour cette maison.
- Et pourtant, on a tous ces indices.
- C'est la planque principale, hein ?
Pourquoi entrer
alors qu'il suffit de garer
une camionnette dans la rue
pour suivre toute la drogue du Westside
qui transite par là.
On va trouver des fragments
du monde de Barksdale
qu'on n'imaginait même pas.
Vous êtes pas faciles à trouver.
Et puis, c'est quoi,
le nom de ce détachement ?
Putain, Kima est là.
Comment ça va, Wig ?
Brigade criminelle de Pikesville.
Il s'appelle Troy Wiggins,
mais ne faites pas gaffe à lui,
il raconte vraiment n'importe quoi.
Elle dit ça parce que je l'ai eue
quand elle était du bon côté.
C'est toi, l'affreux qui m'a fait virer de bord.
Allez, c'est ça. Bon, voilà ce qui m'amène.
J'ai fait une opération de revente
dans Arundel.
Un type du Westside est venu acheter 100 g.
- Tout ça ?
- Je sais, c'est pas grand-chose,
mais j'ai ferré le poisson
et il a fini par me dire
qu'il pouvait acheter en gros
chez un type nommé Barksdale.
Jamais entendu parler. Mais j'ai entré
son nom dans la base de données,
et l'ordinateur m'a ressorti Avon Barksdale,
recherché par la police de Baltimore.
Je suis allé voir les Stups,
et Dawson m'a envoyé vous voir.
Comment s'appelle ton poisson ?
Wendell O., comme dans :
oh-merde-j'ai-essayé-
d'acheter-à-un-flic Blocker.
C'est pas Wendell "Orlando" Blocker,
par hasard ?
Ouais, c'est ça.
Orlando.
La porte du fond est fermée à clé.
Et si je vais là-bas, ils arrêtent de parler.
Ils se tiennent tranquilles.
Tu as dit qu'un type avait parlé
de faire venir quelqu'un dans les tours.
- Oui.
- C'est lequel qui a dit ça ?
Il était grand, je crois.
Qui d'autre se trouvait là ?
Je ne vois pas très bien sans mes lunettes.
Où sont-elles ?
Tu ne vois pas les visages sans ça ?
Tu ne les portes pas
quand tu travailles, hein ?
Vous les porteriez, vous ?
J'ai besoin de mes pourboires.
- Impossible.
- Pourquoi ?
Une pointure ne serait pas inscrite
aux Alcools.
Il aurait une connexion pour Barksdale.
Il se ferait pas choper.
Il est inculpé et il s'est mis à table.
Vous trouverez jamais Avon ou Stringer
dans la même pièce que la came.
- On monte ce dossier avec les écoutes.
- Il achète peut-être pas à Barksdale.
Peut-être seulement à Savino ou Wee-Bey.
Qu'il aille se faire voir.
Wee-Bey est déjà impliqué dans un meurtre
et Savino n'est qu'un minable.
On peut prendre
ce qu'Orlando nous donne sur le club.
Soit le blanchiment de l'argent,
soit les filles.
S'il coopère, je laisse tomber
quelques années et on n'en parle plus.
- Daniels est ici ?
- Oui.
Un appel du préfet adjoint.
Je vous le passe ici ?
Non.
Il ne manque pas grand-chose.
- J'ai besoin d'aide.
- Putain, Bubs.
Tu me fais traverser la ville
quand c'est l'enfer au boulot,
tout ça pour me taxer 10 $, c'est pas cool.
Attends, j'ai pas besoin de 10 $.
Je sais pas. J'ai besoin d'un endroit à moi.
Un lit, des draps, des vêtements.
J'ai vraiment besoin
de nouveaux vêtements.
T'es clean depuis quand ?
Depuis trois jours.
T'es sérieux ?
Qui sait ?
Qu'est-ce que je vais faire d'un indic clean ?
T'y as pensé ?
D'accord, je suis avec toi.
Ouais ?
Putain, montre-moi que t'es content.
Je crois que je peux trouver
un matelas et une chambre,
tout ça pour 200 $.
Bon. On en reparlera.
J'ai un truc à faire ce soir,
alors bipe-moi demain.
Demain ?
Je suis avec toi.
- L'informateur dit pouvoir acheter en gros.
- Ni de Barksdale ni de Bell.
Comment en êtes-vous sûr ?
Barksdale se déplacerait pour
quelle quantité de drogue, à votre avis ?
1 kilo ? 2 kilos ? 20 kilos ?
Ce n'est pas en achetant qu'on va les avoir.
Ces gens ne touchent pas à la drogue.
Ils ne s'en approchent pas.
On aura Barksdale grâce aux écoutes.
On pourra arrêter tout le gang.
Jour après jour, petit bout par petit bout.
On achète et on arrête, lieutenant.
Je vous l'ai demandé il y a des mois.
C'est comme ça qu'on réussit toujours
à clore nos affaires.
Pourquoi New York ?
Ça doit bouger un max là-bas.
C'est super grand, tu me suis ?
- Tu crois pas à la trêve ?
- C'est pour ça que j'ai demandé l'argent.
S'il avait dit :
"On paie pas, sois heureux d'être en vie",
j'aurais trouvé ça honnête.
Mais il m'a proposé 5 000 $.
Non mais, sans déconner.
Écoute, j'ai pas demandé grand-chose,
mais j'ai pas trop d'argent pour voyager.
Évidemment, je pourrais aller faire un tour
et me payer tout seul, mais bon.
N'oublie pas de me biper. On va avoir
besoin de toi pour le procès Gant.
Te fous pas dans la merde.
Reste en liberté.
Passe me prendre devant le magasin
discount au coin de Lex et Fulton.
J'y serai après 22 h.
Ça marche.
Écoutez tous.
Nos amis des Narcos
nous ont filé 30 000 $ pour acheter.
Mais il ne faut pas que l'argent disparaisse.
Pas question.
Kima sera dans la voiture pour l'achat,
elle nous tiendra au courant.
Et elle a l'air crédible.
Où sera ton arme ?
Il peut me fouiller,
elle devra être dans la voiture.
Je pense que quand Savino
montera dans la voiture,
j'irai à l'arrière.
Mon arme sera sous le siège.
On ne pourra pas les filer de trop près
ce coup-ci,
mais on entendra tout.
Kima nous enverra sa position
quand elle pourra.
Je veux seulement rappeler à M. Blocker
que notre accord est contingent
à sa coopération.
Et l'arrestation de Savino Bratton
compte moins
que celle de quelqu'un de plus important.
Si Savino vous parle d'Avon ou de Stringer,
c'est mieux pour nous et pour vous.
Ils savent déjà qu'il s'est fait arrêter, non ?
- Ils vont se douter que c'est un mouchard.
- J'ai besoin d'argent pour un avocat.
C'est ça, l'histoire.
Il s'est fait arrêter,
et il doit se remettre au boulot
pour payer la caution et l'avocat.
Bon. Au travail.
Attention, c'est ma carrière
que vous avez dans les mains.
- Tu as une voiture ?
- Dans le parking.
- Donne-moi les clés.
- C'est moi qui conduis, connard.
Allez.
J'ai du crack.
Pas pour moi.
Du crack.
Ma copine. La moitié du fric est à elle.
Chéri, puisqu'on descend l'avenue Nord,
arrête-toi au bureau de tabac
pour quej'achète des clopes.
Ils sont sur l'avenue Nord,
suivez-les de loin.
Putain. C'est trop fort.
Est-ce que quelqu'un les voit ?
Négatif, 1 1-35.
Allez, Greggs, dis-nous où tu es.
Gare-toi ici.
- Quoi ?
- Gare-toi ici.
Merde pas avec le fric.
Je reviens avec ta came.
On est où ?
Ça disait Longwood,
mais je suis sûre que c'est Warwick.
Les mecs de la cité
ont dû tourner les panneaux.
Je pense qu'on est au nord de Warwick,
dans une allée...
Je sais pas,
un peu à l'est de Longwood, peut-être ?
J'espère que vous entendez.
On est à peu près à huit rues.
Je me rapproche un peu.
Avis à toutes les patrouilles.
Warwick près de Longwood,
dans l'allée au nord. Ou pas loin.
Ça tient debout ?
Tu te rapproches ?
Faut qu'il se magne,
parce que je sais pas où est la came,
et si on se fait trimballer dans ce quartier...
- C'est quoi ?
- Quoi ?
C'est pas normal.
- Quoi ?
- Y a un os.
Espèce de sale mouchard !
Appel d'urgence !
Coups de feu...
Coups de feu.
Alerte à toutes les patrouilles. 11-35.
Appel d'urgence. Warwick,
près de Longwood, un policier touché.
Deux hommes, en sweat à capuche,
les deux, il y en a un qui...
Appel d'urgence. Warwick,
près de Longwood. Vérifiez les allées.
Côté nord, dans les 2800. Rien.
Une blessée. On la récupère d'abord,
elle était sous couverture.
Patrouille 833, on se dirige vers l'est,
dans les 3100 de la rue Baker.
Pas de lumières dans les 2900.
11-35, l'ambulance arrive.
Reçu.
1 1-71, est-ce que quelqu'un les voit ?
Est-ce que quelqu'un les voit ?
- Hélicoptère.
- On cherche quoi ?
1 1-35 au Q.G.
On ne trouve pas le policier. L'hélicoptère
doit chercher une Lincoln verte
avec un toit marron dans une allée.
doit chercher une Lincoln verte
avec un toit marron dans une allée.
Hélicoptère en route, 3-1-4.
3-14, nous avons une urgence.
7820, côté impairs.
Dans les 3300 de la rue Baker.
Rien à signaler.
Côté pair de Warwick et Longwood
dans la ligne de mire.
Appel d'urgence ! Un policier touché.
Le 4X4 à l'ouest de Warwick,
prenez la prochaine à droite.
Je vous préviens, elle ne bouge pas.
Là. Appelez les secours.
Un policier est touché, une ambulance.
7820, arrivé sur les lieux,
faites venir une ambulance.
Reçu.
Que font les secours, merde ?
Signal d'urgence, un policier est blessé.
Les secours arrivent.
On a une description ?
Aux patrouilles sur les lieux.
Avez-vous une description du suspect ?
Négatif.
Combien de douilles ?
Allez, allez !
Un autre sac, ici.
Seigneur.
Sergent ?
Oui ?
Qui se charge de l'affaire ?
Cole et Norris.
Cole est ici,
et Norris est à l'hôpital.
Que vous faut-il ?
De la place.
Je répète aux gens de quitter les lieux,
entre les Stups,
les Narcos et les deux districts,
ça n'arrête pas d'affluer, ici.
Personne ne bouge !
J'ai dit : "Personne ne bouge", bordel !
Si aucune tâche ne vous a été assignée
par un inspecteur de la Crim,
vous devez quitter les lieux.
Y en a-t-il qui ne comprennent pas
un ordre direct ?
Sauf indication contraire
de la part de vos supérieurs,
virez-moi votre petit cul inutile de là.
Fissa !
Prenez votre temps.
Je ne veux pas qu'il y ait de bourdes.
D'accord.
Il était coincé au fond.
Hors de sa portée.
Elle l'a scotché à l'avant,
mais dès qu'elle s'est assise
sur cette banquette pourrie,
Ie scotch a cédé.
Le flingue a dû glisser en route.
Merde.
Où étaient les renforts ?
Il y avait deux voitures
qui la suivaient à distance.
Elle s'est paumée dans les allées.
À la radio, elle a parlé du nord de Warwick.
Ils ont entendu les coups de feu ?
Le Foxtrot a fini par la repérer.
Vous devez quitter les lieux.
On avait deux voitures côté nord,
et un hélico.
Et personne n'a vu de véhicules en fuite.
Bunk.
Terry, Mike, venez.
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?

HEURE
"De la came sur la table."
-- Daniels
Vous ne pouviez pas la voir ?
Dans ces rues, on ne voit rien.
- Elle a fait de son mieux.
- Je sais, je demandais juste.
La piste qu'on a, c'est Savino Bratton.
Un sous-fifre de notre cible, Barksdale.
Je l'ai déjà dit à vos hommes.
On enquête sur lui.
Mais il n'était pas seul.
Il y a plusieurs sortes de douilles,
et le Glock de Kima est plein.
- Alors ?
- Une balle dans la poitrine.
Une dans la gorge.
Son état n'était pas stable.
Ils utilisaient un dispositif
pour raviver son pouls.
C'est pas bon signe.
Sur Baker, vous entendez les tirs.
Où est l'autre voiture ?
- Sur Warwick, je crois.
- Bon.
L'est est bien couvert,
- à l'ouest, il y a la voie ferrée.
- Le Foxtrot ?
Il n'a vu que nos véhicules.
Lieutenant,
je sais ce que vous ressentez.
C'est la tâche la plus difficile
pour un préfet de police.
Je ne m'y ferai jamais.
Voici le lieutenant Daniels.
Oui, bien sûr.
Le service est entièrement dévoué
à l'inspecteur Greggs,
n'hésitez pas.
Je voulais que vous le sachiez.
Oui, monsieur.
Jaybird.
On a des empreintes.
Il va falloir les mouler.
Appelez le technicien.
1 1-39.
Je sais que l'argent
n'est pas la préoccupation première.
Je ne vais pas
vous emmerder avec ça
alors que vous avez perdu
une des vôtres qui risque...
Seigneur, c'est atroce.
- Si on trouve ce Savino...
- La ferme !
J'emmerde votre fric.
Jimmy ?
Vous êtes blessé ?
Non.
C'est le sien.
Allez, debout.
Levez-vous, on s'en va.
Allez.
Elle ne pouvait ni parler ni respirer.
Rien.
Elle était mal en point.
Est-ce qu'elle...
Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?
Allez, avancez.
C'est quoi ?
On a prévu quoi, Ray ?
Bunk et Jay restent ici.
Keeley et Crutchfield
tapent des mandats d'arrêt contre Savino.
- Et l'autopsie ?
- Je m'en charge. À la morgue.
Norris et Holley sont en réanimation,
au cas où elle reprendrait conscience.
Les empreintes sur la voiture ?
Worden s'en charge.
Vous êtes le commandant ?
Major Rawls, de la Crim.
Si vous avez besoin de quoi que ce soit,
des hommes, de l'argent,
vous n'avez qu'à demander.
C'est ça.
Ton inspecteur est en réanimation.
Bon, au boulot.
Va te faire foutre.
Quoi ?
On a une table d'écoute.
Et alors ?
L'enculé qui vient de tirer sur un flic
est sur écoute.
Si quelqu'un se sert du mauvais téléphone,
cause de ce qui s'est passé,
il faudrait être où pour le savoir ?
Le toit de l'église ?
Oui, toi et moi.
Sydnor, tu prends la cabine
de la rue McCullough.
Est-ce qu'on a averti les proches de Kima ?
Merde.
Je m'en occupe, et je te retrouve à l'église.
Bunk, Mike.
C'était qui, cette salope ?
- Toujours un truc qui foire.
- Ouais.
- Ouais ?
- C'est fait.
D'accord.
On se tire.
Oui.
Fais venir le technicien.
Photos et moulages.
1-39.
11-35.
Pouvez-vous m'envoyer 18-1 2 ?
Oui.
Reste ici.
Personne ne s'approche de cette merde
jusqu'à l'arrivée du technicien.
Regarde.
Il s'est arrêté.
Soit il s'est fatigué, soit...
Il est monté dans une voiture.
Très juste.
- 1 1-34.
- J'écoute, 11-34.
Je suis dans le...
bloc des 3 000 à Landvale.
J'inspecte les environs de la voie ferrée.
Il me faut des techniciens
et un marteau-piqueur.
Un marteau-piqueur ?
On va prendre un morceau de route, Q.G.
Vivante. En salle d'opération.
Mes hommes l'ont déjà écoutée.
- C'est une copie.
- D'accord.
On a apporté une machine...
- Où est...
- Monsieur.
Elle est là.
Oui, mettez-la.
Merde pas avec le fric.
Merde pas avec le fric.
C'est Savino.
Je reviens avec ta came.
On est où ?
Ça disait Longwood,
maisje suis sûre que c'est Warwick.
Les mecs de la cité
ont dû tourner les panneaux.
Je pense qu'on est au nord de Warwick,
dans une allée, je sais pas,
un peu à l'est de Longwood, peut-être ?
J'espère que vous entendez.
Ça tient debout ?
Faut qu'il se magne,
parce queje sais pas où est la came,
et si on se fait trimballer dans ce quartier...
C'est quoi ?
Seigneur.
- C'est pas normal.
- Quoi ?
Y a un os.
Doux Jésus.
Appel d'urgence.
Merde !
Elle ne trouve pas son arme.
- C'est quoi ?
- Deux hommes, en sweat, les deux...
Éteignez ça.
Éteignez.
Dr Mells, ligne 6.
Écoutez-moi, petit con.
Vous avez bien foutu le bordel.
Vous avez forcé des mains
et bien des gens à faire
des choses qu'ils ne voulaient pas faire.
C'est vrai.
On le sait tous les deux.
Dr Ralston,
appelez le service de cardiologie.
McNulty, vous êtes un putain d'emmerdeur.
On le sait tous les deux.
Tout le monde le sait, à la Crim.
Mais croyez-moi,
vous n'êtes pas responsable
de ce qui est arrivé à Kima.
Ce n'est pas de votre faute,
vous m'entendez ?
Vous n'y êtes pour rien.
Pour rien, connard.
Croyez-le ou non,
tout ne dépend pas de vous.
C'est moi qui vous le dis,
et je vous déteste, McNulty.
Alors, si c'était de votre faute,
je serais le premier à le dire.
Ça a mal tourné.
C'est elle qui a pris.
C'est la seule leçon à en tirer.
Police !
Police, montrez vos mains.
- À terre !
- À terre !
On a un mandat, à terre !
Police, à terre.
Montrez vos mains.
- Il est pas là !
- Qui est pas là ?
- Zach, il est pas là !
- Zach ?
C'est Savino, qu'on cherche.
Savino ?
Non, c'est mon homme.
Ton homme, il a tiré sur un flic.
Ils font des raids, ils cherchent Savino.
- Quoi ? C'est quoi, ce délire ?
- Il paraît qu'il a tué un flic.
Qui ? Savino ?
Savino a pas tué de flic.
En tout cas, ils en sont persuadés.
- Merde.
- Je tejure, mec.
Au moins, ils en parlent.
Des rumeurs.
Ils en parlent, ils sont pas sûrs.
On va s'y prendre autrement.
Stringer a été bipé deux fois, ce soir ?
Dont une fois après la fusillade.
Qui est 07 ?
Quel téléphone dit-il à Stringer d'utiliser
pour le rappeler ?
- Ça s'est bien passé, mais...
- Chut.
Un agent a été blessé à 00 h 30.
Il s'agissait peut-être d'un agent infiltré.
- Vas-y, parle.
- Comme je disais, ça s'est bien passé,
sauf qu'il y avait cette salope à l'arrière.
On s'y attendait pas.
Je l'avais pas vue avant les coups de feu.
Pour ma part, j'aurais laissé partir la fille.
Elle avait pas l'air du genre à cafter.
Mais quand Little Man l'a vue,
il a flippé et il a tiré.
- Savino t'avait pas parlé d'elle ?
- Pas le temps.
Il sort de la bagnole,
on le voit remonter la rue,
comme on avait dit.
Une fois qu'il a été hors de vue,
on a fait l'opération, comme prévu.
Cette meuf était flic.
Et elle est pas morte.
Où avez-vous mis les armes ?
C'était pas un flic. On aurait dit
une des putes de Chez Orlando.
Bey, où sont les armes, bordel ?
- Dans un égout de Park Heights.
- C'est quoi son problème, à Little Man ?
Ce petit con a déjà flippé une fois.
Il va encore flipper quand il va apprendre
qu'elle était flic ?
Franchement.
Savino a une version qui tient debout,
et il le sait,
mais Little Man est une putain de mauviette.
Il faut éliminer Little Man.
T'as compris ?
Ça commence à craindre.
Tu piges ? On doit se replier.
Je veux voir comment ça se passe
pour Savino,
comment il s'en sort.
Mais si ça foire,
ou que ce putain de flic se réveille
et commence à déblatérer,
tu devras disparaître.
T'as des amis où ?
À New York.
Jersey, Cleveland.
D'accord. Alors, Philadelphie.
Washington.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
Va là où on ne te connaît pas.
Tu piges ?
Bon. Il va falloir être prudents.
Seigneur.
Je suis désolé.
Ça va, vous m'avez juste fait peur.
Je travaille avec Kima.
Kima, elle...
Kima est au boulot.
Qu'est-ce que...
Le combiné, le retour de monnaie
et le dessus en métal.
La canette aussi.
Dr Jones au poste des infirmières.
On ne peut pas en être sûrs.
Lieutenant.
Je suis avec la fille de Kima, et...
Peut-être qu'un gars de la police
ou de la Ville
pourrait lui dire un mot.
Qui est ici ?
Sa fille, vous dites ?
Sa fille ?
L'agent Greggs a une fille ?
Une colocataire.
Sa famille vit à Richmond, elle est en route,
mais sa colocataire est déjà ici.
Je vais le faire moi-même.
Pas de problème.
Si elle meurt,
il pourra poser à l'enterrement.
MERCENAIRES - "WEE BEY"
Il faut trouver Savino.
Ses lieux de fréquentation,
sa copine, sa mère : en vain.
On a trouvé des cheveux
sur un des sweats à capuche.
C'est mieux que rien.
Ces mecs-là sont soit des gars de la cité
qui ont réussi
un casse de 30 000 $ dans la rue, soit...
Soit c'est des pros qui opèrent
d'un côté de la voie ferrée,
qu'ils traversent ensuite
pour regagner leur bagnole.
Et l'autopsie ?
M. Blocker est mort assassiné,
des suites de blessures par balles
à l'épaule, à la poitrine et au bras gauche.
Neuf millimètres, marquage en six,
comparaison possible.
On a trouvé une autre arme
sur la banquette arrière, non ?
Oui, un .380. Partiellement chromé.
Douilles différentes.
Il y a donc bien deux tireurs.
On en tient un.
Wynton "Little Man" Rice,
mercenaire au 221,
sans aucun doute un acolyte de Barksdale.
On en tient un ?
Avec quoi ?
Une canette de soda.
Trouvée à la cabine
de Park Heights et Belvedere.
Il y avait encore des bulles.
C'est quoi, cette histoire de cabine ?
C'est de cette cabine
que Stringer Bell a été bipé
20 minutes après la fusillade.
Il y avait trop d'empreintes sur le combiné.
Alors, on a un homme de Barksdale,
dans le nord-ouest,
qui appelle le patron juste après la fusillade.
On oublie la théorie des amateurs.
Bon travail. Vous êtes ?
Freamon. Lester Freamon.
Où travaillez-vous ?
À l'unité des Prêts sur gage.
À quoi ça sert de buter un flic ?
Je vois pas l'intérêt.
Sérieux.
Si c'est un keum de la cité,
Ies Stups vont débarquer et casser du Black.
Les Blacks de Park Heights,
ils sont vraiment graves.
Courageux, mais graves.
Poot.
Wallace au téléphone.
Ah oui ? Wallace ?
Il m'appelle deux fois par jour,
même s'il a rien à dire.
- Il me soûle avec son mal du pays.
- Il est où ?
Sur la côte, avec sa grand-mère...
Il fait du surf, un truc comme ça.
Je sais pas.
Dr Zellesky, un appel sur la ligne 5.
Tu viens d'utiliser la cabine ?
Oui.
- Vous devriez aller rue Mosher.
- Juste maintenant ?
Oui.
- Viens au commissariat.
- Au commissariat ?
Il faudrait m'expliquer, là. D'accord ?
- J'ai jamais été aussi clean.
- Je ne fais que mon boulot.
D'accord.
Ça va, M. Plage ?
Je suis dans la baie, je t'ai dit.
Ma grand-mère vit dans la baie.
T'es quand même en vacances,
et tu m'as pas emmené.
T'y es allé comment ?
En car.
Dis-moi où c'est, je te rejoins.
Je viendrai glander avec toi.
Non, c'est pas le paradis. Il fait humide.
C'est pire qu'à Baltimore.
Et ces grillons font un boucan d'enfer.
Ça m'empêche de dormir.
Je crois que la campagne,
c'est pas mon truc.
Veuillez déposer deux dollars
pour avoir deux minutes supplémentaires.
Faut que j'y aille.
On peut sortir un Black du Westside.
Mais on ne peut pas...
Comment tu t'appelles ?
J'ai rien fait, d'accord ?
Je t'ai demandé ton nom.
C'est pas réglo, ça.
T'essayais de biper qui ?
Qu'est-ce que ça peut vous foutre ?
Je veux dire...
Tu as exactement trois secondes
pour t'expliquer, connard.
Un des tireurs
a ouvert la portière du passager,
donc toutes les empreintes de ce côté-ci...
- Pourquoi tu l'as bipée, ducon ?
- Laissez-moi.
Tu crois que c'est un jeu ?
Je veux parler à Greggs.
- Tu peux pas, connard.
- À McNulty, alors. C'est pas réglo, tout ça.
Savino.
Il est pas dans le coin.
Il y a un mec des pavillons
au téléphone de la tour 2.
D'accord.
Il a peut-être oublié le numéro.
C'est quoi, ça ?
Tu sais pas ?
C'était le réapprovisionnement de la tour.
Quatrième étage, côté sud, deuxième appart.
Arrêtez de boire.
Arrêtez de boire et faites votre boulot.
Je peux vous poser une question ?
Combien donneriez-vous
de cette affaire pour la ramener ?
Ce n'est pas la question.
Combien ?
La totalité.
Mais ça marche pas comme ça.
Pas de marche arrière.
J'ai un putain de rapport d'hôpital
qui ne montre aucune putain d'amélioration.
Inconsciente, intubée. Elle a eu une trachéo
et un collapsus pulmonaire,
et avec un peu de chance,
Ia balle qu'elle a prise dans le cou
aura épargné la colonne.
Ça n'en valait pas la peine.
La Crim pour McNulty sur la ligne 2.
Faites votre travail.
Oui ?
Comment tu t'en sors ?
Je survivrai.
Vraiment ?
Écoute, Jimmy.
Il y a eu un petit problème, ici.
Holley a peut-être foutu une branlée
par erreur à un des indics de Kima.
Il est petit ? Il marmotte ?
Oui, c'est lui.
Tu devrais passer et régler cette histoire
avant que ça dégénère.
Oui.
Ça vaut pas la peine.
Ça vaut même pas 10 fois le prix.
Un putain de flic, bordel. Un flic !
Il est con, ou quoi ? Tu vois une meuf
dans la bagnole, tu changes tes plans.
Orlando, on l'aurait buté plus tard.
Savino a voulu le prévenir,
mais dans le noir,
il savait pas par où Bey arrivait.
On a eu la poisse.
Il faut brûler ça. C'est du fric de flics.
Les billets doivent être marqués.
Les flingues sont dans l'égout.
Bey assure, ça va,
mais y a la meuf flic.
Si elle commence à parler,
elle fait tomber Little Man et Bey.
Little Man ?
- Il a peur. Il a buté un flic.
- Merde.
Bey s'en occupe.
Et Savino ?
Savino, il va en taule.
Mais il le savait.
Si son histoire tient debout,
il s'en tirera bien.
On savait qu'Orlando était un putain d'indic.
Mais cet argent liquide. On s'est fait baiser.
Je sais, c'est de ma faute.
Bey et Savino m'ont donné l'idée
de prendre le fric d'Orlando
en plus de le buter.
J'ai dit : "D'accord, vous serez payés"...
Il l'a trouvé où, ce fric, Orlando ?
Hein ?
Je sais.
Je sais, j'ai merdé.
Fous-moi ça dehors, et brûle tout.
Dis à Wee-Bey de tout nettoyer
avant de décoller.
Il envoyait des messages d'urgence
sur son pager.
Je lui ai demandé pourquoi.
Il s'est rebellé.
Et les choses ont dégénéré.
Il sait ?
McNulty. C'est quoi, cette histoire ?
Il a commencé à me frapper.
Kima s'est fait tirer dessus.
Vous foutiez quoi ?
- T'étais où ?
- J'étais avec elle.
Bunk.
Holley enquête.
Les empreintes sur la portière du passager
ne donnent rien.
... il a vu un message d'urgence
sur son pager.
Et le tableau de bord ?
Il faut que tu m'aides !
Appelle le labo.
Je peux faire quoi ?
Déjà, tu peux faire un tour à la cité
pour voir qui manque.
Qui n'est pas dans le coin.
Ça te va ?
Oui, c'est juste...
Je garde mes distances, tu vois ?
J'ai pas trop traîné à la cité
ces derniers temps.
Tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
T'as des embrouilles avec quelqu'un ?
Non, j'ai pas d'embrouilles avec...
Ouvre bien les yeux, Bubbs.
Pour Kima.
Attends. Quelqu'un va te ramener.
On en est où, pour Savino ?
- Toujours rien.
- Ça suffit, ces conneries.
S'il m'appelle, je lui dirai de se rendre.
- Je vais faire ça.
- C'est pas suffisant.
Pardon ?
Il nous le faut maintenant.
Non, merci.
En tant qu'avocat à la cour...
Ronnie est polie.
Elle fait partie de votre sale tribu.
Elle traduit dans votre sale langue. Moi ?
Je me torcherais même pas
avec un avocat d'ici.
Ne le prenez pas mal.
Je ne l'ai pas mal pris.
Je suis disposé à vous laisser
suborner un témoin,
embrouiller un juge et corrompre un jury
sans même froncer les sourcils.
Et je me contrefous
que vous soyez payé en liquide.
Ça, c'est entre vous et le Fisc.
Vous avez en commun de ne pas être aimés.
Ce que Jimmy essaie de dire, c'est...
Non, ce que Jimmy dit, c'est que
si vous voulez que je ferme les yeux,
il va falloir me donner ce dont j'ai besoin.
Et là, j'ai besoin
que Savino Bratton soit coffré.
Je ne sais pas où il est.
Vous l'avez souvent représenté.
Vous devez bien avoir
un moyen de le joindre.
Un policier risque de mourir,
Morrie, et Savino était là.
Qu'il se présente cet après-midi,
et qu'il écope au moins pour la drogue.
Sinon ?
Sinon, on enverra des commandos
chez sa maman tous les soirs,
jusqu'à ce qu'ils aient bousillé sa maison.
Vous recevrez une lettre
du bureau du procureur,
suivie de citations
concernant tous les comptes
à votre putain de nom.
On verra si les dépôts en argent liquide
correspondent au revenu déclaré.
C'est son point de vue,
et je comprends qu'il soit en proie
à la douleur. Je comprends.
Est-ce aussi le propos
du bureau du procureur ?
Oui.
Je verrai ce que je peux faire.
Tu fais chier, Jimmy !
- Tu ne m'avais pas prévenue.
- Il va le trouver.
- S'il le peut. C'est pas le problème.
- C'est quoi, le problème ?
C'est que Morrie Levy a déjà été membre
de l'association du barreau,
et si je ne veux pas rester
procureur adjointe toute ma vie,
je dois arrêter de cracher
sur les gens influents.
Encore une carriériste.
- Va te faire foutre.
- Toi-même.
Si la moitié des procureurs
voulaient pas devenir juges,
ou associés dans un cabinet d'avocats,
si vous aviez les couilles de persévérer,
tu sais ce qui se passerait ?
Un type comme lui serait inculpé,
jugé et condamné.
Les autres se retireraient,
et l'affaire serait jugée comme il se doit.
Mais non, tout le monde reste amis.
Tout le monde est payé.
Et tout le monde a un putain d'avenir.
Tu te sers de tout le monde, hein ?
J'ai cherché les messages mémorisés
qui utilisaient le code 07.
Il apparaît parfois sur le pager de D'Angelo.
Sur celui de Stringer aussi, mais moins.
La plupart du temps,
impossible de localiser ce type,
mais regarde.
- C'est le pager de Stringer ?
- Ça vient de la cabine
des urgences
de l'hôpital général du Maryland.
Laisse-moi deviner.
Cet appel a été passé le jour
où Stinkum a été tué.
Où Wee-Bey a reçu une balle dans la jambe.
C'est ce qu'ils ont dit sur la bande.
En sortant les dossiers
des urgences de cette matinée-là,
on va trouver celui de Wee-Bey.
07, c'est Wee-Bey.
C'est obligé.
Et on a Wee-Bey et Little Man
à la cabine de Park Heights
20 minutes après l'embuscade,
qui bipent Stringer.
On cherche ce vaurien de Savino
dans toute la ville.
Il fait partie du gang de Barksdale ?
- Oui.
- Quoi d'autre ?
L'enquête progresse.
On essaie d'identifier les tireurs
grâce à l'écoute.
J'ai ordonné l'achat contrôlé.
J'ai mis une des nôtres en danger.
Alors maintenant,
je veux être sûr qu'on fait le maximum.
- C'est ce qu'on fait.
- Bien.
Le préfet exige des raids.
Partout.
Chez tous ceux contre lesquels on peut
émettre un mandat pour trafic de drogue.
La Crim, les forces armées, les Narcos,
et demain, au journal de 18 h,
on met de la came sur la table.
Plein de came.
De la came sur la table ?
On va leur montrer à qui ils ont affaire.
On ne leur donnera pas
une seconde de répit.
Le préfet veut envoyer un message,
lieutenant.
Alors vous et vos hommes,
veillez à ce que le message passe.
De la came sur la table.
On fait ce qu'il a dit.
On leur montre à qui ils ont affaire.
Ah oui ?
Et on est qui, nous ?
Je le répète, et que ce soit clair,
on n'a pas lu ses droits à M. Bratton,
et ce qui est dit ici
vise à trouver une entente.
- Sommes-nous d'accord ?
- Oui.
Bien.
Tenez.
C'est du bicarbonate de soude.
Que M. Bratton comptait vendre
à Orlando Blocker.
On vous l'offre de bon coeur.
Où est l'argent ?
M. Bratton n'a pas perçu d'argent.
Il l'a laissé quand il est allé chercher
le bicarbonate.
Si vous avez enregistré la transaction,
la cassette le confirmera.
Et il était absent lors de la fusillade.
Il ignore qui sont les tireurs.
Et bien sûr, il ignorait tout du piège.
Par un hasard inouï,
il les a laissés dans un cul-de-sac
et on leur a tiré dessus
deux minutes plus tard.
C'est des conneries.
Un policier a été blessé.
M. Bratton ignorait que la jeune femme
était agent de police.
Et n'avait nulle autre intention
que d'arnaquer M. Blocker de 30 000 $.
Mme Nathan ?
Pas d'inculpation
s'il donne le nom des tireurs.
Et s'il témoigne,
il bénéficiera du programme fédéral
de protection des témoins.
Comme je l'ai dit,
M. Bratton ignore qui a tiré sur M. Blocker
et sur l'agent infiltré.
Le mieux, c'est 286B.
C'est quoi, ça ?
Distribution de fausse substance.
Trois ans maximum, 5 000 $ d'amende.
C'est tout ?
S'il avait pris l'argent,
on aurait pu l'inculper de vol,
mais la cassette prouve qu'il ne l'a pas pris.
Trois ans.
On a tiré sur un flic, Morrie.
Alors si on le condamne,
il purge chaque jour de sa peine.
Je peux faire trois ans. Pas de problème.
Et les 5 000 $ d'amende ?
Il te reste quand même 25 000 $, non ?
Bien joué.
Donne-m'en deux.
Putain, Orlando.
J'arrive toujours pas à y croire.
Toute cette merde à cause de lui.
C'était qui ?
- Il gérait un club pour mon oncle.
- Ah oui ?
Oui, d'abord Stink, et maintenant, lui.
Et il paraît que les flics cherchent Savino.
- Il est pas ici.
- Little Man non plus.
Il faut que ça cesse, ce bordel.
Ouais.
Ça craint, de buter des keufs.
Tu sais comment est ton oncle,
quand les mecs foirent.
Il prend ça perso.
Y en a encore un ou deux
qui vont se faire buter.
Quoi ?
C'est toi, Dee ?
Oui.
Faut que t'ailles voir Stringer
immédiatement.
Tu vois ?
Tu gravis les échelons.
J'espère que tu fais pas partie
des hommes à abattre.
Ouais, on verra.
Je reviens.
Les mecs de la tour sont nerveux.
Little Man s'est pas pointé au taf.
Il répond pas à son pager non plus.
Tu vois ?
Je ne vous mentirai pas.
Elle a des tuméfactions
au niveau des vertèbres,
et il y a des signes de paralysie partielle.
Ils disparaîtraient
avec la rémission des tuméfactions.
Sa famille est avec elle.
Qu'est-ce qu'ils foutent, à la Crim ?
Ils ont identifié les tireurs ?
Ils les cherchent.
Le service a décidé de faire des raids
dès demain matin.
Dans toute la ville.
Chaque unité, chaque district fera des raids
partout où on peut obtenir des mandats.
On fera pareil.
- Lieutenant, est-ce que...
- Sauf...
à la planque principale.
La maison du nord-ouest
mentionnée sur la bande.
Pour cette planque, il faudra la jouer fine.
Et des raids trop précis
amèneraient Barksdale à la bouger.
Il comprendrait qu'il est sur écoute.
On a deux planques potentielles
dans les pavillons
et deux autres maisons
qui ont servi de planque
la semaine dernière.
Mais ça...
Ça, c'est notre meilleure chance.
Herc a pris ces photos hier.
Quatrième étage,
dernier appart du côté sud du 221 .
Ils lancent la came par la fenêtre
aux dealers.
Et s'ils changent d'appartement ?
Ça change tous les jours.
Hier, c'était le cinquième étage côté nord.
On postera un homme sur le toit
avec un portable.
Dès qu'ils changent, on appelle le juge
qui émet un mandat oralement.
On attaque à 1 1 h.
L'équipe qui prend la tour
devra être en poste à 5 h.
Soyez à l'intérieur
avant que l'immeuble se réveille.
Si vous voulez dormir cette nuit,
commencez à taper les mandats.
Qu'est-ce qu'y a ?
Pourquoi le club est fermé ?
Tu vas avec Bey.
Bey.
Sois prudent.
Pas d'erreurs.
On va où ?
Qu'est-ce que t'attends ?
Arrêtez de me prendre pour un con !
La planque principale.
Il sait qu'on est dessus.
Il sait qu'on lui a caché.
L'adjoint.
On apprend qu'un mec du sénateur
rackette la cité, il le sait.
La police d'État nous donne un indic,
il le sait.
Il sait tout.
Il a un indic.
Ici, dans ces murs.
Au début
de notre enquête, Burrell me tenait.
Je répétais tout à ce connard.
Mais il vous a perdu.
Il a donc choisi quelqu'un d'autre.
C'est comme ça qu'ils font.
On peut parler ?
Veuillez m'excuser, messieurs.
Burrell, il faut qu'il se calme.
Que se passe-t-il ?
On a la planque principale.
Celle de Barksdale.
Il veut qu'on fasse des raids
plutôt que de monter un dossier solide.
- Pourquoi ?
- De la came sur la table.
Un coup de pub pour faire digérer
ce qui est arrivé à Kima Greggs.
Seigneur.
Il va falloir le secouer.
Je ne sais pas, Jimmy.
Tu te présentes aux élections ?
C'était la même rengaine.
Ils me narguent,
veulent nommer un autre juge noir
pour faire quatre contre un,
pour compenser.
Le gouverneur devait promettre
deux nominations.
Alors, on est de retour à la case départ.
C'était tout.
C'est tout ?
C'est les coups bas de la politique.
Ça n'a rien à voir avec ton affaire.
J'ai besoin de toi.
Alors, tu vas m'aider ou non ?
Je fais ce qu'ils me disent, c'est tout.
Je cherche pas à savoir ce qu'ils ont en tête.
Écoute, Bey.
Mais là, ça a dégénéré.
Tourne dans cette allée. Juste là.
Pourquoi tu t'arrêtes ? Avance !
On va à l'intérieur. Viens.
Putain, ça craint.
Entre, petit con. On n'a pas toute la nuit.
Allez, entre.
Allez.
Qu'est-ce que t'as ?
Regarde, Dee.
Tu vas les nourrir pendant mon absence.
Il y a de la bouffe différente
pour chaque aquarium.
Mais t'inquiète pas.
Je vais te montrer quoi faire. Viens.
Ça, c'est mes tétras.
Il y a Kimmy, Alex, Aubrey
et Jezebel, qui se planque.
Elle fait la belle.
Deux pincées de la bouffe
qui se trouve près de l'aquarium.
Ça leur suffit pour la journée.
Tu vois, c'est pas compliqué.
Et ils sont magnifiques.
Je monte faire mes bagages.
Bey.
On va où ?
À Philadelphie. Tu ramèneras la bagnole,
mais je dois d'abord prendre mes affaires
et te montrer quoi faire pour les aquariums.
Philadelphie ?
On a tiré sur une meuf des Stups.
Pas de Savino.
Pas de Little Man, ni de Wee-Bey.
Et le neveu de Barksdale, de la cour,
est aussi aux abonnés absents.
C'est eux qui ont fait le coup ?
Wee-Bey, Savino, Little Man.
C'est aussi ce qui nous semblait.
On a les empreintes de ces connards,
et ils ont un sacré casier.
On analyse le sang et les cheveux.
C'est Bey et Little Man, tireurs un et deux.
Je le sens, Bunk.
Ah oui ?
Maintenant, il faut que Kima se réveille
et le confirme.
D'accord.
Bon boulot, Bubbs.
McNulty, tu sais...
Ies choses ont changé pour moi.
- Je veux dire, je suis...
- C'est l'heure.
Il faut que j'y aille.
Prez va te faire raccompagner.
Déployez-vous.
Police.
Police ! Allez !
Montre tes mains, connard !
À terre. Allez, vite !
McNulty, Freamon, vérifiez le sous-sol.
- Y a rien ?
- Non.
- Dans la salle de bains non plus.
- Le matelas.
Regardez sous le lit, dans les tiroirs,
dans tous les recoins de la pièce.
- T'as quelque chose ?
- Non.
Bingo.
J'ai trouvé. La voilà.
On ramasse.
On le soulève.
Beau travail, Erv.
Mesdames et messieurs,
ce que vous voyez sur cette table
représente la réponse de la police
à une culture de la mort et de la drogue.
Lorsqu'un agent est blessé
dans cette guerre,
Ies autres sont prêts à continuer
et à mener le combat
contre tous les responsables.
Ce n'est qu'un début. Je vous le garantis.
Mais aujourd'hui, un message a été envoyé.
Et croyez-moi,
ce message est entendu haut et fort
par ceux qui recherchent
le profit et le pouvoir
en important et en vendant de la drogue.
C'est calme.
Du bavardage à la cabine rue McCullough,
rien dans les tours.
Qui est sur le toit ?
Personne.
Laisse tomber.
Où est le fric ?
- Il te faut combien ?
- Le billet coûte 18 $.
Ta grand-mère les a pas ?
Sije les lui demande,
elle va m'empêcher de partir.
Je te dis, mon pote.
La campagne, ça me réussit pas.
Il faut que tu m'envoies du fric pour le billet.
PAS PERTINENT
Je comprends.
- Tu veux rentrer quand ?
- Dès quej'ai le fric.
Je te l'envoie aujourd'hui.
ALERTE ROUGE
Comment va-t-elle ?
Elle déguste son intraveineuse de morphine.
Ils ont juste dit que son état s'est stabilisé.
Allez la voir.
Non.
Alors bougez-vous le cul.
Faites vos voeux de rétablissement
ou replongez-vous dans cette enquête.
- Cette enquête, je l'emmerde.
- Ah oui ?
Vous allez faire quoi,
mettre un terme à votre croisade ?
Pour vous, c'était une croisade ?
Avon Barksdale était un moyen
de prouver mon intelligence
et à quel point ce service est bordélique,
c'est tout.
Il suffit de glorifier l'héroïsme
de Jimmy McNulty
devant tout le monde
et de faire péter la boisson.
Il n'a jamais été question d'Avon Barksdale,
lieutenant.
Mais de moi.
D'après vous, j'étais pas au courant ?
Personne n'était au courant ?
Écoutez, cette enquête doit continuer
avec ou sans vous.
Elle s'est fait buter grâce à ça.
Je l'ai remontée à fond
pour lui montrer
l'importance de cette enquête.
Vous savez quoi ?
Burrell, Rawls et les autres avaient raison.
Cette enquête ne vaut rien.
J'en avais rien à foutre
quand vous prêchiez votre croisade.
Mais là, y a cette femme ici, un bon agent
sous respiration artificielle
parce qu'elle y croyait.
Et ceux qui ont buté Kima ?
lls sont dans la nature.
Et celui
qui a envoyé ces connards dans cette allée
doit aussi se faire buter.
Vous pouvez rester là, avec vos bouffées
d'alcool et de compassion,
si vous voulez, mais cette enquête
est devenue importante.

HEURE
"C'est ma vie, ici même." -- Wallace
Tu les as rappelés ?
J'ai pas arrêté ce matin.
J'attends leur coup de fil.
Putain, à midi on n'aura plus rien.
Poot ! T'as combien ?
200, environ.
C'est quoi cette merde ?
Qu'est-ce que tu crois ?
De la bouffe pour poisson.
File-moi mes trucs.
Regarde qui voilà.
String.
J'ai besoin de vos pagers.
Ceux de tout le gang.
- Qui d'autre ?
- Sterling, Cass et Manny.
- Va les chercher.
- Comment je fais pour joindre ma nana ?
Utilise ta main, c'est ta nouvelle nana.
Plus de... Barre-toi.
Casse-toi d'ici, mec.
Plus de pagers. Plus de coups de fil
aux dealers et guetteurs.
Personne n'utilise ces portables
à part toi et Bodie
et pas un mot, c'est compris ?
On a les numéros
et on est les seuls à en avoir besoin.
Pas de mère ou de nana.
C'est bien compris ?
Vous utilisez ces portables
pour donner rendez-vous, pour y aller
et discuter face à face, c'est tout.
- Y aura plus de cabines ?
- T'es sourd ? J'ai dit non.
Et comment je te contacte ?
Le premier numéro, si t'as besoin de stock,
Ie deuxième, de renforts.
Si t'as besoin de moi, c'est le troisième.
Retiens ces numéros et jette cette feuille.
- Tu fais pareil dans les tours ?
- Oui, partout.
Les pagers et les cabines, c'est fini.
- D'accord ?
- D'accord.
String.
On a besoin de stock,
à midi on n'aura plus rien.
Quel stock ? T'es sourd ou quoi ?
Les Stups ont pris notre came.
Pourquoi on change de tactique,
à ton avis ?
Barre-toi, merdeux. Ça te regarde pas.
D'accord ?
Très bien. Et voilà.
Voilà, c'est fini.
Le pouvoir de redonner la vue.
Nos compliments !
Brigade de police de Baltimore.
- Je vous vois tous.
- Moi aussi, je peux pas te rater.
Ils se sont débarrassés de leurs téléphones.
- Hier soir, ils ont tout viré.
- J'en étais sûr.
Putain, j'en étais sûr.
Je peux prédire ce que ce connard va faire.
Pas un seul message depuis ce matin.
Merde, j'ai même dû relâcher Prez.
- Pour l'envoyer à Annapolis.
- Pour quoi faire ?
Les rapports financiers
de la campagne fédérale. J'ai vérifié.
Mais le fric de Barksdale semble se balader.
Merde.
Tout ce boulot
pour installer le système d'écoute.
Une fois épinglés,
ces gars-là changent leur routine.
- Et ils savent qu'ils ont tiré sur un flic.
- Alors on doit changer.
Venez.
Shardene !
Chérie, voilà l'inspecteur McNulty,
il bosse avec nous.
Elle bosse chez Orlando
et nous aide de temps en temps.
Maintenant, je crois qu'elle voit assez bien
pour identifier les voix entendues.
Lester, je vais être sincère.
Je suis morte de trouille.
Mais le moment venu,
je sais que tu assureras.
Pearlman va devoir homologuer
son micro portatif.
- Je peux avoir un café ?
- Comment vous le voulez ?
Je m'en charge. Une noisette, c'est ça ?
Ces putain de Stups m'ont pris mon stock.
- Vous pouvez remplacer le stock et l'argent.
- Il a raison.
- Tenons-nous-en aux trucs qui comptent.
- Tout compte.
Ils veulent me foutre en taule.
Ce qui compte,
c'est d'avoir une vision globale.
Demandez-vous qui peut vous nuire.
Où sont vos points faibles ?
Où va-t-il falloir faire du ménage ?
Réfléchissez-y.
Commencez avec Orlando, s'il a cafté.
Il a au moins dû parler du club.
Ce renoi de merde n'aura eu que ça à dire.
C'est tout ce qu'il savait.
On le mêlait pas au biz.
On le tenait à l'écart.
Vous n'êtes pas lié au club.
Vous n'avez pas de licence
et n'êtes pas référencé.
Ils peuvent pas remonter jusqu'à vous.
Quand est-ce que ça a commencé ?
Au moment où ton neveu
a été déclaré innocent.
Après, ils ont dû retrouver le témoin
avec une balle dans la tête
et les journaux en ont parlé.
Mais entre-temps, les flics nous filaient.
L'agent de sécurité
qui a permis la libération de D'Angelo...
- Nakeisha Lyles ?
- Oui.
La salope de camée. On s'en est occupés.
- Donc elle peut toujours vous nuire ?
- Oui.
Tous ceux qui peuvent vous nuire
peuvent être interrogés.
- Moins j'en saurai, mieux ce sera.
- D'accord.
Fermez la porte.
On a Bird et Bey.
- Bird va assurer.
- Il est déjà en taule, et Bey va le rejoindre.
Et Wee-Bey est un dur à cuire.
On a Savino.
Il sait juste qu'on est inculpés pour la coke.
Il va pas se mettre à pleurer
pour trois années de taule.
Exact.
On a aussi l'embrouille avec Orlando,
et là, Little Man était le seul à faire chier.
Était.
Qui d'autre ?
Finies les écoutes.
La Cour m'a accordé
un délai de 90 jours sur cinq téléphones.
Je vais jusqu'au bout.
Si vous voulez écouter
ces cabines de merde, allez-y.
Mais vous n'avez pas besoin
de toute cette équipe.
Vous voulez quelques éléments,
je vous les donne.
Un instant, lieutenant.
C'est moi qui vous les ai donnés.
Je décide qui me revient.
Mais faites
comme si la décision vous revenait.
Il vous a posé une question, lieutenant.
Je n'ai pas d'avis. Choisissez.
Comment s'appelle
ce vieil inspecteur des Prêts sur gages ?
Et le jeune, le gendre idiot de Valchek ?
Freamon, Pryzbylewski.
Gardez-les.
Renvoyez-moi Sydnor et Santangelo.
Lieutenant, si vous voulez faire autre chose
qu'écouter ces téléphones sans tonalité,
vous devrez m'en parler avant.
Vous avez bien agi, Cedric.
Vous avez pensé à votre avenir,
le travail effectué ces derniers mois
va être très apprécié.
Le major Spurgeon
prend sa retraite fin novembre.
Un poste vacant à la direction nord-ouest.
C'est vrai.
Salut, Ronnie. Prenez place.
- Sheila, envoyez-moi Patrick.
- Bien, monsieur.
- Des nouvelles ?
- De moi ?
La même merde, un nouveau dossier.
- Ça en est où, avec Barksdale ?
- Vous avez lu mes rapports ?
Finies les écoutes,
on cherche un micro caché dans son club.
À part ça, vous bossez sur quoi ?
Sur les rapports financiers
des campagnes électorales
de Baltimore, c'est ça ?
Ah bon ?
On fait ça ?
On appelle aussi quelques donateurs
pour leur poser des questions
et vérifier leurs antécédents.
Je ne suis pas au courant.
Ronnie, quel est notre but, là-dedans ?
Ce sont des rapports publics, non ?
Dans cette affaire,
personne n'a exigé quoi que ce soit.
Ils l'ont aussi fait dans votre dos ?
Pour éviter tout malentendu,
je vous donne ceci.
Des copies de chèques
émis par mon comité de réélection
pour rembourser cinq donateurs différents
totalisant 4 500 $.
Avec les copies des chèques
des donateurs, dans ce dossier.
C'est comme
l'histoire de la femme de César.
On a seulement pu retracer
ces cinq chèques.
Je ne les connais pas
et je ne connais pas la raison de leur don.
Il faut rembourser ces donateurs
sur-le-champ.
Écoutez-moi.
Je n'ai jamais entendu parler
d'une enquête sur les dons électoraux.
Quoi qu'il en soit,
ceci confirme
que nous ne sommes pas corrompus.
Je veux que tu rapportes ça à qui de droit
et que tu leur dises
que je ne leur en veux pas.
Quoi de neuf, String ?
Vous vouliez me voir ?
Il faut qu'on cause avec ton pote
qui a raflé la prime
pour avoir tué le mec d'Omar.
Je me rappelle pas son nom.
Lequel ?
Celui qui était chez le Grec ce soir-là.
- On l'avait payé pour guetter les flics.
- Je peux savoir pourquoi ?
Est-ce que c'est tes oignons ?
- Vous inquiétez pas pour lui.
- Et pourquoi ?
Il fait plus partie du jeu.
Plus partie du jeu ?
On t'a posé une question très simple.
Je veux pas vous manquer de respect.
Vous le savez bien.
Je vous dis juste
que ce gars ne fait plus partie du jeu.
Et même si c'était pas le cas,
y a rien à craindre de lui.
Mais on veut juste lui parler, Dee.
Lâche ce gars.
Lâche-le, c'est tout.
Chérie, arrête de toucher à ce truc.
- Tu les as pris où ?
- Chez Prevas.
Au marché de Broadway ?
- Les meilleurs hot-dogs en ville.
- Jamais de la vie.
Je te file 10 $
si tu m'en trouves de meilleurs.
- Chez George sur la rue Light.
- À côté du Grec ?
Ils ont fermé cet endroit
quand ta mère te donnait le sein.
Quand elle me donnait le sein ?
Je l'ai tétée hier soir.
Tu me dois 10 $.
Si tu m'en trouves de meilleurs
au présent, pas au passé.
- T'as juste dit des meilleurs.
- Alors va m'en prendre un.
- Tu peux pas y aller.
- Tu m'as dit
- ... des meilleurs.
- En vrai...
Vous pouvez parler moins fort ?
Je n'entends rien !
Tu saurais combien j'en ai
si tu m'en prêtais un peu.
- T'aimes ce frigo ?
- Si t'as des thunes.
Je vais en avoir. Je suis là pour ça, tu vois ?
Pour discuter de certains trucs.
Quand t'auras fini, tu pourras revenir.
D'accord. Ne bouge pas, minot.
Je vais t'en trouver de la pure.
Les renois, vous êtes trop bavards.
D'où elle sort ? De la police municipale ?
Non, elle faisait partie
des civils chargés de la sécurité.
- L'uniforme des agents municipaux est gris.
- Donc elle n'était pas armée.
Ça en a l'air ?
Tu t'en vas déjà ?
Je suis arrivée tôt,
j'ai fait la clientèle du midi.
Elle sort.
- Du nouveau ?
- Rien de spécial.
L'essentiel se trame dans ce bureau.
Y a pas de raison que Shardene
y soit assez longtemps pour tout choper.
- Enlevez-le, je peux plus le faire.
- Tu n'y seras plus obligée.
J'ai l'impression qu'ils vont me démasquer.
Ça suffit.
Tu n'auras plus besoin de porter ce micro,
d'accord, chérie ?
Tu dois juste y retourner une dernière fois.
Regardez-moi ce paysan.
- Putain, Wallace.
- Wally !
Il chialait pour que je lui paie le bus.
Ça m'a gavé, il se passe rien à la campagne.
Pas assez d'action pour moi.
T'as réussi à te faire une paysanne ?
Si c'est oui, elle avait quatre pattes.
Y a pas de fermes là-bas,
mais ils avaient des super pompes.
Y avait des soldes samedi soir
à l'hypermarché.
- Et moi j'allais...
- Des larmes ? T'allais pleurer.
Elles viennent de là, tes Die-Hard ?
- C'est des Timberland.
- C'est vrai.
Je vois l'arbre sur le côté.
Vous me refilez mon ancien taf ?
Une minute. Si tu veux qu'on te réengage,
faudra d'abord faire guetteur.
T'as perdu ton rang en quittant la ville.
Un vrai mec reste avec les siens,
il ne se casse pas à la vue du sang.
Tu sais toujours alerter pour les keufs ?
S'il veut reprendre son taf, qu'il le fasse.
S'il le veut.
Mon pote va peut-être retourner
à Edmondson,
on en a discuté, pas vrai ?
Viens, on va discuter.
T'as pas vraiment enculé une bête, hein ?
- Casse-toi, Poot.
- T'es con.
Ne baise pas avec mes fringues.
- Qui s'en est occupé ?
- Garvey.
Il sait qu'on a un témoin,
mais ne veut pas le dire aux patrons
avant d'en savoir plus.
Pourquoi avoir buté
Nakeisha Lyles maintenant ?
Parce qu'ils savent qu'on bluffe plus.
Avon est en train de faire son ménage.
Plus de coups de fil,
puis disparition de ceux
qui pourraient le dénoncer.
Et le gamin ?
Merde.
On l'a foutu au vert vendredi
et on devait le ramener
- ... Iundi pour le jury d'accusation.
- Et puis ?
- Greggs a été blessée.
- Agent Reese ?
Je suis le lieutenant Daniels
de la brigade de Baltimore.
Quelqu'un pourrait-il aller
près de Cambridge
aller voir le gamin qu'on y a planqué ?
- Appelez-le.
- Y a pas de téléphone.
- Juste un instant.
- D'accord.
Dites à Sydnor
de prendre une voiture du parc.
Le gamin est ici ce soir,
il dormira sur mon canapé
et passera
devant le jury d'accusation demain.
- Et la strip-teaseuse ?
- Elle a du cran.
Je veux dire qu'il faut la protéger.
Finis les cadavres !
Y a de la place chez moi, elle peut y rester.
- Ça ne pose aucun problème.
- Vous êtes un officier, inspecteur.
J'assure la sécurité du public, lieutenant.
Je veux dire que ce taf, c'est plus pour toi.
Tu te casses, t'as foutu la merde.
- C'est pas ta faute.
- Dee, écoute.
J'apprécie ton geste,
mais j'ai grandi ici, d'accord ?
J'ai toujours été ici.
C'est chez moi, d'accord ?
Tu ne m'écoutes pas, Wallace.
Si tu fais ce taf,
c'est pour la vie, d'accord ?
Tu fais pas semblant
et tu t'assures de rester fidèle aux tiens
et que ça se sache.
Pas de paroles en l'air, pas de remords,
et pas de cafardage.
C'est comme ça.
- Tu t'es perdue dans la cité ou quoi ?
- Je te cherchais.
- Tu sais que je bosse ici.
- Un travailleur doit manger.
- Ma tourte au poisson préférée ?
- Pâte sablée et moutarde.
Tu vas me faire pleurer, tu sais.
Il va falloir que j'y retourne.
- Prends soin de toi.
- Toi aussi.
D'accord.
Ça.
De chez Sterling, on va se faire un festin.
C'est où, chez Sterling ?
Sur la 29e rue ? Tu connais pas ?
Si c'est pas dans le Westside,
je connais pas.
Tout ça,
c'est ma vie, ici même.
C'était qui, ta nouvelle meuf ?
Non, c'est ma mère.
Vous connaissez le sénateur Davis ?
Non, monsieur.
Lieutenant.
Clay souhaitait vous rencontrer
pour vous offrir son aide.
De l'aide ?
Apparemment,
vous vérifiez des rapports financiers
et contrôlez certains des donateurs.
Je souhaitais vous rassurer là-dessus.
Je n'ai rien à voir avec la drogue, lieutenant.
C'est bien.
Et cette histoire
avec le chauffeur du sénateur.
M. Price, Damien.
Day-Day.
Cette histoire avec M. Price
est un malentendu
qui ne concerne pas la police.
Il transportait 20 000 $ en liquide
qu'il a reçu d'un suspect
dans une tour des H.L.M.
Des billets flambant neufs,
en petites coupures.
Ce n'est pas illégal.
Damien transportait déjà cet argent
en se dirigeant vers la cité Franklin.
L'argent d'une soirée bénéfice
du week-end précédent.
Nous avons révisé le rapport financier
qui montre...
Très bien.
Il n'y avait aucun motif valable
de fouiller M. Price.
Je crois que nous sommes d'accord.
Si, il y en avait un.
Vous pouvez prouver qu'un don sénatorial
est lié au trafic de drogue ?
Nous avions des raisons d'arrêter M. Price
et de le fouiller,
après quoi nous avons découvert
20 000 $ en liquide,
en coupures flambant neuves.
Je n'ai rien dit de plus.
Tu veux bien dire à ce connard
pourquoi il est ici ?
- Lieutenant Daniels...
- Excusez-moi, monsieur.
Pas besoin d'expliquer.
Si le sénateur n'a rien fait d'illégal,
pas besoin de s'inquiéter.
Je pense que c'est assez clair.
Mais vous croyez quoi, vous ?
Qu'on sait qui nous donne de l'argent ?
Qu'on veut savoir
leur nom ou leurs motifs ?
On n'a aucun moyen
de confirmer leur nom ou leur histoire.
On s'en fout.
On encaisse les chèques,
on compte les votes, et la vie continue.
Ce sera tout, monsieur Burrell ?
Messieurs.
Il va falloir le foutre dans un coin
tellement paumé
qu'il pourra voir arriver de loin
les flics de Philadelphie.
Tu ne parles pas qu'à moi, Erv.
Tu parles au maire,
au conseil municipal, au comité fédéral.
Et en ce moment même,
tu nous piques du fric.
Dix-huitième !
Dix-huitième au hit-parade.
Inspecteur Hauk au rapport, monsieur.
La meilleure ? Carver est 37e.
Ça aide, si on connaît les numéros.
Ça vous rend plus professionnel.
Putain de Carver,
en rentrant de sa formation,
je vais lui apprendre le respect.
Je vais lui apprendre le respect.
- Félicitations.
- Merci, monsieur. J'apprécie.
- Sergent Hauk ?
- Que Dieu nous vienne en aide.
- Daniels.
- Daniels, c'est l'agent Reese.
La mamie dit
que le gamin est parti y a deuxjours.
Wallace s'est enfui. Deux jours.
- Merci.
- De rien.
Pas de nouveau stock dans les tours ?
On a que dalle.
- Quoi de neuf, mec ?
- Comme d'hab.
Qu'est-ce qu'il a, le gamin ?
C'est un minot, c'est tout.
Mais Dee lui a rendu son taf.
Sérieux ? Je croyais que c'était fini.
À un moment, mais il est revenu.
Où était-il ?
Apparemment, chez sa grand-mère.
Chez sa grand-mère.
Il paraît qu'il a chié dans son froc
en voyant ce qui est arrivé au mec d'Omar.
Il est pas fait pour ça. C'est un Bisounours.
D'accord. Et toi ?
T'es fait pour ça ?
C'est clair.
T'es prêt à faire le boulot ?
T'as un flingue ?
Très bien, soldat.
Personne en haut.
Pas de câbles électriques. Pas de fusibles.
Pas de Wallace.
Putain, ce chinetoque de Bob
ne fout jamais de serviettes dans le sac.
C'est parce que les serviettes sont chères.
Moi aussi, ça me coûte cher.
Allez, venez. Vous voulez manger ?
C'est par ici.
Allez, il faut manger cette bouffe chinoise
parce que c'est un peu la dèche
en ce moment.
T'écoutes quoi ?
Attends, prends une assiette.
Big Tymers,
leur nouvelle vidéo passe sur MTV.
- Sur MTV ?
- C'est de la bombe.
- Oui.
- Vraiment ?
- C'est quoi, ton surnom ?
- Buff, car j'assure.
T'assures ?
Buff, il faut
que tu manges ces pâtés impériaux.
Buff, il faut
que tu manges ces pâtés impériaux.
Des nouvelles du gamin ?
J'ai sillonné Cambridge toute la nuit
avec son rapport.
S'il est là-bas, il est bien caché.
On a averti
chaque patrouille de l'ouest et du centre.
On cherche l'adresse de sa mère.
- Inspecteur.
- Lieutenant.
Finies les écoutes,
donc on est obligés
de rapatrier du personnel.
Sydnor, on a encore du temps,
car Cantrell m'est redevable.
- Ça va avec Rawls ?
- Son affaire est résolue, non ?
Qu'est-ce qu'il va faire ?
Fais gaffe à toi, Sanny.
C'est quoi ?
Le plan de Chez Orlando. Les étages.
C'est le bâtiment d'à côté.
- Tu les as eus rapidement.
- Merci CoStar.
Il faut qu'on mette un micro dans le bureau.
Peut-être quelques fibres optiques.
Mais on ne sait pas où est le bureau d'Avon.
C'est là qu'intervient Shardene.
Elle va faire quoi ?
Demander à Avon de prendre une photo ?
Avez-vous fait votre service militaire ?
Comment mesurer un pas d'homme ?
Putain d'objecteurs de conscience.
- Donnez-moi une règle et une ficelle.
- Pourquoi moi ?
Pourquoi ?
- Parce qu'il l'a dit, c'est tout.
- Wallace, c'est pas un indic.
Comment tu le sais ?
Comment tu sais ce qu'il a fait ?
Il était stone. Je l'ai vu en acheter.
Il est sûrement parti au vert pour se retaper.
S'il en prend, il n'est pas fiable.
Réfléchis.
On a reçu un ordre, d'accord ?
On le suit ou on va se faire foutre.
C'est comme ça.
C'est la merde, mais c'est comme ça.
Cedric.
Tu connais un élu de Baltimore
qui ait rendu son argent ?
Quoi que vous ayez fait,
ça a fait peur à mon patron.
Il m'a appelé pour me donner ça.
Désolée de poser des questions
sur notre enquête.
C'est énervant.
Bon sang, mais qu'est-ce que vous faites ?
Ouais.
C'est l'argent d'Avon ?
Des adresses de l'Eastside,
mais Barksdale pourrait avoir
d'autres planques.
- Ça vient du procureur ?
- À la vitesse de l'éclair.
Vous causez des ennuis.
Pourquoi ne m'avoir rien dit ?
C'est pas mieux comme ça ?
Ma mère m'amenait souvent ici.
On allait au Paradis des Fruits.
- Et y avait des limonades ?
- Non, que des jus frais.
Mais ma mère
mettait du Bacardi dans le sien.
Elle en mettait dans tout.
Tu parles de ta mère comme un gamin.
Je dois penser à elle.
Toi, t'as pas besoin
de toujours jouer au dur.
Le maillon faible.
T'es un gamin ou un homme ?
Je suis un homme.
On fait quoi, on va s'éclater ?
À cet étage,
c'est la deuxième pièce à partir de derrière.
Les escaliers sont à 30 pas de l'entrée,
y a 24 marches de 30 cm chacune.
En arrivant au dernier étage,
y a huit pas jusqu'à la porte du vestiaire
et 10 autres jusqu'à la pièce arrière.
Ça fait 25 m sur 35.
Le troisième étage du bâtiment est vide.
Sinon, il nous faut un mandat.
- 15 $.
- Prends-en 10.
- 15 $.
- Connard, t'as pas de compteur.
Barre-toi de là.
Il est 2 h 30 du matin.
Tout doux.
On a besoin d'un trou de la taille d'un doigt.
Et pas comme vos doigts
en forme de saucisson.
Vous savez ce que ça implique,
de grandes mains.
Vous savez ce que ça veut dire, non ?
Lieutenant,
je viens de trouver la nouvelle adresse
de la mère de Wallace.
C'est bon, ça ira.
Vous êtes où ?
Si je vous trouve, ça va mal se passer.
Sortez de vos cachettes.
Vous êtes où ?
Écoutez, là, je rigole pas.
Vous entendez ?
Ça suffit. Putain, vous êtes où ?
Si je vous trouve, ça va barder.
Alors, vous êtes où ?
Gare à vous si je vous trouve.
Regarde, Poot.
Little Man a laissé son baladeur.
T'es qu'un trouillard, mec.
T'aurais dû rester à la campagne.
Vous êtes mes potes.
T'as qu'à t'en prendre à toi-même.
- On est potes !
- C'est de ta faute.
Mais pourquoi ?
On est potes depuis tout petits,
rappelez-vous !
Vas-y, pisse dans ton froc comme un gamin.
Sois un homme !
Tiens-toi comme un homme.
- Vous êtes mes potes.
- Tu disais être un homme.
- Tiens-toi bien droit !
- On est ensemble.
Tu vas le faire ou je...
Darcia Wallace ? On cherche votre fils.
Vous pourriez
peut-être nous dire où il se trouve.
Pardon ?
Merde, moi aussi, je cherche ce petit renoi.
Il m'a piqué 10 $.
- Récemment ?
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Rien.
Des policiers m'ont interrompue,
je voulais me servir un verre.
Votre fils est peut-être en danger.
Ça va barder pour lui s'il se pointe.
Il m'a piqué ces 10 $ sans me demander.
- Je vais le cogner à l'en rendre bête.
- Voilà mon numéro.
Si vous le croisez, appelez-moi.
Chez Orlando - Club pour Messieurs
- Vous avez unejeep ?
- Là-bas, mec.
Voyons voir ce qu'y a ici.
Il déménage.
Pourquoi t'hésites ?
Vous avez fait rentrer le coffre-fort
et tu peux pas le sortir ?
Appelle le SAMU et parle à celui qui répond.
Tu dis rien, même pas ton nom.
Tu dis juste
qu'y a un animal blessé dans la maison,
puis tu raccroches.
Qu'est-ce qu'y a ?
Pourquoi t'as besoin de moi ?
Il faudrait que t'ailles à New York
récupérer un truc.
Je sais qu'on n'a plus de came.
Merde, tout le monde a besoin de stock,
maisj'aijamais fait ça.
Écoute, y a pas beaucoup de gens
à qui je peux faire confiance.
Personne de ma tribu. Tu me suis ?
- D'accord ?
- Y en a combien ?
La même quantité que d'habitude.
Distribues-en assez pour couvrir les tours.
- Quand ça ?
- Ce soir.
D'accord.
Je conduis quoi ?
- Une simple voiture louée.
- Je la loue où ?
J'en sais rien, mec, près de l'aéroport.
- Allô.
- On est sur un gros coup.
- J'arrive.
- D'accord.
Merde !
- C'est laquelle ?
- La caisse louée ? La Taurus.
Je dois avouer, lieutenant,
que vous avez de l'influence sur le F.B.I.
Oui, Daniels.
Où ça ?
C'est Wallace ?
Un H.L.M. reçoit une aide fédérale
de 250 millions de dollars
Le pauvre gosse.
Sans Wallace, Stringer n'ira pas en taule.
Il s'est changé là-dedans.
J'y crois pas !
Il faut qu'il ait l'air présentable.
C'est bon. Pas besoin de le suivre.
Laissons faire le satellite.
Et si j'appelais mon avocat
pour qu'il vous explique le délit de faciès ?
M. Barksdale, nos caméras au péage
vous ont filmé
sur le pont George Washington à 23 h 10,
puis reprenant l'autoroute à la même sortie
35 minutes plus tard.
Pourquoi être allé à New York
pour n'y rester qu'une demi-heure ?
Sortez de la voiture, monsieur.
Vos mains doivent rester visibles.
Demi-tour contre la voiture,
posez vos mains sur le toit.
- Avez-vous une arme, monsieur ?
- Non.
- Un couteau, des aiguilles ?
- Non.
Détenez-vous des substances illégales ?
Bon. Écartez les jambes.
Un peu plus.
Mettez doucement
votre bras droit derrière le dos.
Et le bras gauche.
- Tu te souviens de moi ?
- Mon avocat.
Doucement. Ce n'est que le début.
Je veux mon avocat, connard.
Bon, t'es un dur, mais tu sais quoi ?
- Je m'en fous.
- Toi ?
J'en ai marre de tes combines.
Tu veux que j'écrive une lettre
ou un truc du genre ?
Il n'y a plus de combines.
On t'a arrêté avec un kilo de pure.
T'as rien fait foirer. T'as été réglo.
Aucune entrave au code de la route.
Mais demande-toi donc
comment ces agents
étaient au courant, hein ?
Quelqu'un d'autre a merdé. Tu me suis ?
Mais ça va être toi le responsable,
tu vas tout encaisser.
- Mon avocat.
- C'est Levy, n'est-ce pas ?
C'est ton oncle qui le paie, n'est-ce pas ?
Bien sûr, il assure tes arrières.
Davantage que toi.
Écoutez,
je ne parlerai plus,
sauf à mon avocat.
Au fait,
ton pote Wallace
s'est fait buter dans les pavillons.
C'est comme ça que tu protèges les tiens ?
T'es qu'un putain de menteur.
Et alors ?
Je dois aussi écrire une lettre à sa mère ?
Barrez-vous d'ici.
Tu n'avais pas besoin
de l'envoyer comme ça.
Dans une voiture ?
Il aurait dû se faire suivre.
Ça aurait pu être le train,
mais ça ne change rien,
il n'aurait pas dû être seul.
- Écoute, Brianna...
- Tu connais les voitures piégées ?
T'as envoyé mon fils à New York
dans une putain de caisse louée
et tu le laisses conduire
avec ce stock dans le coffre ?
- Désolé...
- Ça va pas le faire sortir de taule !
T'as intérêt à ce que ton avocat juif
fasse bien son boulot, d'accord ?
- D'Angelo va faire sa part de boulot.
- C'est-à-dire ?
Tu aimes la caisse que tu conduis, non ?
T'aimes cette piaule ? C'est moi qui la paie.
Tu l'aimes bien ?
On a tous plein de trucs à protéger.
Tu dois le lui rappeler.
Le moment venu,
il faudra qu'il prenne ses responsabilités.
Ne t'en fais pas pour mon gamin.
Je l'ai bien éduqué.
C'est pas moi qui ai merdé.
Ah bon ? Alors c'est qui ?
Pourquoi on est là, putain ?
Il faut juste que tu restes calme
jusqu'à ce qu'on paie la caution.
On a de bonnes chances de te faire sortir.
Et ensuite ?
Qui va tout encaisser
pour ce qu'y avait dans le coffre ?
Où est Wallace ?
Où est le gamin, String ?
D'Angelo, ferme ta gueule.
Où est Wallace ?
C'est tout ce que je veux savoir.
Il vaudrait mieux y réfléchir.
Putain, où est Wallace ?
String !
Regarde-moi !
Putain, où est Wallace ?
Je veux pas
que ce connard à deux balles me représente.
Je vais me trouver un avocat, d'accord ?
Remontez dans votre caisse
et rentrez chez vous.
D'accord, connard de merde.
T'as pris ta décision.
Oui, ça y est. Où est Wallace ?
Putain, où est Wallace ? Où est Wallace ?
Putain, où est Wallace ?
Stringer !
Arrêtez-le.
- C'est fini.
- Pourquoi ?
On peut avoir l'accusation quand on veut.
On ne garde pas les écoutes
dans son bureau ?
Les écoutes dont vous ne m'avez pas parlé.
Je pensais que votre petit mouchard
vous avait tout dit
juste après qu'on l'ait fait.
Un membre de notre équipe a été blessé.
C'est important.
Nous recherchons les coupables
et grâce à Dieu et à votre travail,
il y a assez de preuves
contre notre cible majeure.
Il suffit d'inculper Barksdale
pour sa tentative d'achat
à New York, et tout sera fini.
Et Stringer, son numéro deux ?
Impossible de l'inculper
avec la mort du gamin.
Nous avons fait le maximum.
Vous m'avez écouté ?
Ils sont coupables
d'avoir tiré sur un officier.
Pas seulement les tireurs,
mais ceux qui gèrent le trafic.
J'essaie de les coffrer
une bonne fois pour toutes.
C'est tout ce que vous faites ?
S'il n'y a que ça, pourquoi votre équipe
vérifie des campagnes
et des rapports financiers ?
Quel est le putain de rapport
avec votre enquête ?
L'argent a un rapport.
Il fut un temps où j'aurais agi différemment
pour vous laisser cacher cette saleté,
mais plus maintenant.
Vous voulez en parler ? Très bien.
Parlons de vos vieilles saletés
du quartier est.
Parlons du temps où vous faisiez
n'importe quoi chez les Narcos.
- Ce sont des ragots.
- Des ragots ?
Des rapports du F.B.I.
Vous avez fait
beaucoup d'argent rapidement.
Vous pourriez aller rapidement en prison
si je commence à poser les questions
qui fâchent.
L'affaire est classée ou vous êtes fini.
Je n'ai même pas besoin de vous
pour faire enfermer Barksdale.
Votre major le dira à vos inspecteurs
et établira le mandat lui-même.
Cette affaire est classée !
Faites ce que bon vous semble.
Vous voulez arrêter Avon
avec des preuves boiteuses ? Allez-y.
Vous voulez me salir ? Je vous en prie.
Le quartier regorge d'histoires.
Il n'y a pas que la mienne.
Beaucoup de personnes y ont travaillé.
Si vous vouliez tout bousiller,
vous l'auriez déjà fait.
Mais rien ne vous effraie plus
qu'un mauvais titre, n'est-ce pas ?
Vous préférez la corruption
et vous ne ferez rien pour l'enrayer.
Établissez des mandats, je ferai mon boulot.
Mais tant que je n'arriverai pas au bout
des 90 jours,
I'enquête continue.
Regarde-moi cette force de frappe de merde.
- Regarde-les.
- D'accord.
- Quoi de neuf avec Levy ?
- Il va venir nous voir là-bas.
J'ai toujours pas fait sortir ce coffre-fort.
Y a combien d'argent ?
- 150 000 $.
- 150 000 $ ?
Ouvre-le.
Pas besoin de gâcher un bon coffre-fort.
Je pensais
que ça allait être plus marrant que ça.
Les gars du GIGN
adorent sortir leurs joujoux.
Ils croient que c'est Tony Montana ?
Ils ont pas touché un flingue
depuis des lustres.
Quelle merde.
Nous deux, lieutenant.
Quelles unités sont dans l'allée ?
Vous voyez la porte arrière ?
D'accord, qui est sur le toit ?
À mes ordres, on attaque. Tenez-vous prêts.
On n'aura pas besoin de vos gars.
Rappelez-les.
- Attendez...
- C'est mon enquête, rappelez-les.
On t'aura plus tard.
C'est bien.
Barksdale s'est fait coffrer.
Toujours pas de Wee-Bey, ni de Little Man ?
Non, toujours pas.
ARRÊTÉ
C'est le meilleur boulot que j'aie fait.
C'est ma meilleure affaire.
Mais ce n'est pas assez.
Je retourne
au service des Véhicules demain.
J'ai l'impression que c'est pas terminé.
Inspecteur.
Salut.
On a appelé,
ils nous ont dit que t'étais réveillée
et quand on est arrivés, tu t'étais rendormie.
- Vous êtes là depuis longtemps ?
- Non.
Vingt minutes.
On ne voulait pas te déranger.
Je m'ennuie, c'est tout.
Oui, mais quand même.
Alors, t'as quoi pour moi ?
- Des planches de photos ?
- Ouais.
Little Man. Certaine.
C'est bien. Tu peux écrire ?
Bon, numéro deux.
Little Man, c'est bon,
parce qu'il était devant,
il tentait de récupérer le fric
sur le tableau de bord.
Mais l'autre, il était dehors, dans le noir.
- Alors...
- Bon, c'est pas grave.
Tu reconnais quelqu'un ?
Oui. Wee-Bey.
Bon.
Je vais te dire
où on en est avec les agresseurs.
On a suivi leurs traces
et Landsman a retrouvé leurs sweat-shirts.
On a fait correspondre l'A.D.N.
d'un cheveu trouvé sur un sweat-shirt
à Wee-Bey.
Freamon a remonté un appel d'une cabine
près du lieu de l'agression
au pager de Stringer Bell.
Celui qui a appelé a fait le code de Bey.
Au labo, ils ont trouvé une empreinte
sur une canette près du téléphone
qui correspond à Little Man.
Alors, tu vois, ce que je dis...
Bon, écoute.
Il y a une mauvaise nouvelle.
On n'a pas les armes,
pas d'empreintes sur les lieux,
pas de témoins.
Mais le pire, c'est qu'on a affaire
à un jury de Baltimore
où trouver un honnête homme
n'est pas facile.
Douze, encore moins.
Une identification de tes deux agresseurs
faciliterait bien les choses au procès.
Ouais.
Parfois, les choses sont difficiles.
SUR ÉCOUTE
Mise sur écoute activée
ÉTAT DU MARYLAND
MISE SUR ÉCOUTE AUTORISÉE
Durée : 15 secondes
HEURE
"ça fait partie du jeu..."
-- Quartier ouest traditionnel
On a tous ceux de la liste sauf C.C.O.
On est allés chez sa mère
et elle dit qu'il est à Wabash
pour une citation du tribunal.
Va sur l'ordi et vois
si un des shérifs adjoints
peut le choper dans une salle d'audience.
Ouais. Non, on a Ronnie Moe.
Je le vois en train de monter
dans le fourgon.
D'accord.
- On a le quota. Rentrons.
- "Chef."
- Hein ?
- "Rentrons, chef."
Tu as devant toi un futur sergent.
Alors, devant les troupes,
faut s'habituer
à montrer le respect qui convient.
Donc : "Rentrons, chef." Compris ?
RONNIE MOE - ARRÊTÉ
Ça a donné quoi ?
On en a ramené 1 2.
Il en reste donc 7 dans la nature.
Rien d'intéressant ?
Des numéros de téléphone, des surnoms,
pas grand-chose d'autre.
Il nous faut un truc.
L'affaire sera classée si on produit pas
des preuves pour avancer.
L'écoute est au point mort.
Le micro du club sert plus à rien.
Ils ont déménagé
au moment où on a fait la descente.
- Pour aller où ?
- Aucune idée.
Mais ils vont s'installer ailleurs.
Soit Barksdale bouge et se réorganise,
soit il abandonne les tours.
- Si c'est pas Avon, Stringer.
- Pourquoi pas Avon ?
Sans antécédents,
il est libre au bout de deux heures.
Ce qu'on a sur Barksdale
le fait à peine ralentir le pas.
Bon, on apprend où ils se réinstallent.
On demande au procureur
un nouveau micro,
même une écoute, si on a un téléphone.
Pas tant que l'adjoint respire.
On changera de mission
avant que votre déclaration soit tapée.
Et le F.B.I. ?
L'adjoint vous laisserait y mêler le F.B.I. ?
Pourquoi l'en informer ?
McNulty, vous êtes complètement jeté.
McNulty.
Ouais ?
Tu déconnes.
Tu déconnes, putain.
C'est Rhonda Pearlman.
Elle vient d'avoir un coup de fil
d'un avocat du New Jersey
qui dit représenter
un type nommé D'Angelo Barksdale.
Retrouve-moi à la Crim.
Apporte un magnétophone.
Pas d'avocat ? Pas de Levy ?
- Cette affaire va loin, pas vrai ?
- Hein ?
250 000 $ de caution. T'y crois, toi ?
Rien que de sortir cette somme, ça fait mal.
- Où est Levy ? Pas au club ?
- Non. On ne peut plus parler au club.
- Allez, on se casse.
- Salut, mon beau.
Alors, c'est fini ?
Avant de bouger, avant de parler
il faut qu'on réfléchisse.
On a près de 20 arrestations jusqu'ici.
Si on y regarde de plus près,
c'est toujours pour la même raison :
information de source confidentielle.
Ça fait pas beaucoup
pour une seule balance ?
Si. Je pense qu'il y a une écoute.
Peut-être une ou deux lignes,
ou un micro caché quelque part.
T'as téléphoné à ton neveu
pour le truc du New Jersey ?
Bien sûr que non. Pas de téléphone.
Quand je lui parle, c'est face à face,
dans mon bureau, au-dessus du club.
- Putain.
- Heureusement que vous en êtes partis.
J'en sais rien, mec.
S'ils ont un micro là-bas,
ils ont plein de trucs sur toi et moi.
À propos, il a dit qu'il serait là ce soir.
Bey a appelé
- Ils t'embarquent et pas moi ?
- Je pige pas non plus, mec.
On le saura assez tôt, dès que je leur mettrai
la pression pour des preuves.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux faire
avec les mecs arrêtés ?
- Fais-les sortir de là.
- Ça va faire un paquet de fric.
Sinon, on risque de se faire des ennemis.
À propos, où en es-tu avec ton neveu ?
Il va être raisonnable ou quoi ?
Je vais te dire, mec. Il est de la famille, vu ?
Il craquera pas.
Un ou deux jours en taule, il va pleurer
et il attendra la caution comme les autres.
D'accord.
Bon, fais passer l'argent dans les familles,
ça sera plus discret.
- Et n'utilise pas le même garant.
- D'accord.
Écoutez, je sais qu'il est tôt,
mais je veux que vous réfléchissiez
aux accusés
et à la sentence qu'ils peuvent faire.
Vous pouvez limiter votre implication
grâce à une défense structurée.
Ce qui signifie
qu'il faut libérer tous vos hommes,
jusqu'au dernier.
J'ai vu ta collègue aujourd'hui,
pour l'identification.
Comment va-t-elle ?
Pas trop mal.
Elle est sortie de réanimation.
C'est lent, mais ça évolue.
T'es pas allé la voir, Jimmy ?
Non, j'ai pas pu entrer.
Ça n'a rien à voir avec toi, hein ?
J'irai en rentrant du New Jersey.
J'irai.
Tu sais, Cole et moi,
on lui a montré des photos.
Elle a désigné Little Man.
Mais pas Wee-Bey.
Alors j'ai voulu la pousser un peu.
J'étais presque à genoux, à la supplier
de faciliter le procès.
Tu sais ce qu'elle a dit ?
"Parfois, les choses sont difficiles."
Une vraie flic.
Ouais.
- Qu'est-ce que tu lui as fait, putain ?
- J'en sais rien.
Tous les deux dans la même voiture,
sympa, le voyage au New Jersey.
Merde.
Putain, c'est trop calme ici.
Tu sais quoi ? On peut...
Ici, ce sera bien.
Il suffit de mettre un petit coffre
quelque part
et de leur dire
d'amener le fric ici, maintenant.
Point.
Putain, quand vous changez tout, vous...
Vous êtes paranos ?
Vous êtes jamais venus ici.
Cette fois, c'est différent.
On parle plus de rien à l'intérieur.
Les choses ont changé.
Bon, faut se refaire.
Plus on attend,
plus ce sera difficile de garder les tours.
Si tu veux redémarrer,
laisse-moi faire avec String.
- Non, c'est bon.
- Faut te mettre au vert.
Elle a raison.
Tu peux plus prendre de risques.
Tu me suis ?
Tant qu'ils sont sur ton cas,
elle s'occupe du fric
et moi du produit.
- On est là pour toi.
- D'accord.
Mais dis à Roberto
de faire une came plus pure.
Je veux que ces enfoirés de junkies
de la cité...
Qu'ils tombent comme des mouches.
Tu piges ?
Fais passer le message,
on n'est pas encore foutus.
- Et mon neveu ?
- T'en fais pas.
Je vais parler à Roberto
et puis j'irai voir Dee.
Je ferai ce qu'il faut.
Dis-lui que je m'excuse
de l'avoir mis en danger comme ça.
Et que je lui revaudrai ça.
Tu lui revaudras ça.
J'en doute pas.
Mais que ce soit clair,
cette coopération
dépendra d'un engagement
qui convienne à mon client.
Sinon,
- tout ce qui est dit ici y reste.
- Absolument.
Une offre dans le Maryland est comparable
à une offre dans le New Jersey.
Et je suis d'accord, en ce qui concerne
Ie trafic de drogue,
votre client nous a bien aidés.
Il a montré sa volonté
de témoigner qu'il était un lieutenant
de l'organisation de revente de drogue
d'Avon Barksdale,
qu'il vendait de grosses quantités de drogue
pour son oncle.
Qu'il livrait l'argent,
assistait à leurs réunions
et faisait parfois un voyage à New York
à la demande de son oncle.
Tout cela confirme en grande partie
ce que nous savons déjà.
Et y a quoi d'autre ?
Les meurtres.
Pourquoi vous insistez avec ça ?
Je vous ai déjà dit,
je sais rien sur les témoins tués.
Quels témoins ?
Tu te souviens d'elle ?
Bon sang.
- Ils l'ont butée ?
- À peu près en même temps que le garçon.
Tous des cadavres.
- Ils se couvrent.
- C'est ce qu'on pense.
- Pas de fuites.
- Je comprends pour la gardienne.
Elle a été payée, fallait l'éliminer.
Orlando en savait trop,
a commencé à balancer, fallait l'éliminer.
Mais le gosse...
Wallace.
Ce soir, il faut quej'aille rue Argyle.
Voir Wallace.
Wallace ?
Il disjoncte
depuis qu'on a aidé ceux de la tour
à buter le voleur.
Je te dis, Wallace est mal.
Il sort même plus de sa piaule.
- Pourquoi ?
- Je crois qu'il se défonce.
- Wallace ?
- Il me fait peur, avec ses conneries.
- Rappelle-moi plus tard.
- Ça marche.
Vous avez ça sur cassette ?
- Seigneur !
- Il s'appelle Brandon Wright.
Brûlé, doigts cassés, oeil arraché,
plein de trucs sympas.
C'est Wallace qui l'a vu.
Il a vu le môme.
Mais il a pas pensé à ce qu'ils allaient faire.
Tu devais savoir. Tu étais près de la cabine.
- Tu le savais.
- J'aurais fait quoi ?
J'appelle pas String, ils l'apprennent
et après, qu'est-ce qui se passe ?
Alors tu as dit à Wallace d'attendre,
tu as appelé Stringer
et Stringer a rameuté ses troupes.
Ouais.
Et chez le Grec, ils ont demandé à Wallace
de leur montrer qui.
Ensuite, ils y sont allés avec des menottes
pour s'acharner sur Brandon.
Ils ont largué le corps pour qu'on le voie.
Ils ont dit :
"On fait passer le message dans les técis."
Wallace,
il a pas supporté.
Quand il a vu ça, il a voulu arrêter,
retourner à l'école.
On a même blagué, il avait 16 ans, tout ça...
Il devait reprendre en 4e.
Il y a une semaine,
mon oncle et String m'ont fait venir au club.
Stringer flippait à cause de Wallace,
et je lui ai dit.
J'ai dit : "Wallace, c'est pas une balance."
En plus, il arrête.
Je lui ai dit ça.
Mais fallait faire plus.
J'aurais dû faire plus...
mais j'ai rien fait, et putain,
c'est de ma faute.
T'as une idée de qui a fait ça à Wallace ?
Allez, Dee, au hasard.
J'en sais rien, ça peut être n'importe qui.
Les tueurs, y en a plein.
Je ne pense pas. Pas dans la cour.
Pas chez lui. J'ai vu sept lits là-haut.
- Où étaient les petits ?
- Si je le savais, je vous le dirais.
Compris ? Je vous jure que je vous le dirais.
Ils sont inculpés
pour Orlando et le flic infiltré,
mais on cherche toujours.
Lui, il est à Philadelphie.
- Comment tu le sais ?
- Je l'ai emmené.
Où ça ?
J'en sais rien, à un coin de rue,
au nord, je sais pas où il crèche.
Wee-Bey t'a rien dit sur l'agression ?
On parle pas affaires dans la voiture.
C'est la règle.
C'est tout ?
Votre client doit comprendre
que tout accord
dépend de son entière coopération.
Il y a rien d'autre.
Deidre.
Toc, toc, toc.
C'était une des nanas de mon oncle.
Certains disent que t'étais avec elle
le soir où elle a été tuée.
Ouais, je savais pas qu'il allait la tuer.
Je le jure. Ils m'ont piégé.
Comment ?
Mon oncle m'a donné 3,5 g de coke.
Il m'a dit de les lui apporter.
Ça m'a surpris,
je croyais qu'il l'avait larguée.
Mais il m'a dit que non,
que c'était pas le cas.
Il a demandé à Wee-Bey de m'emmener.
Je suis monté, j'ai frappé,
elle est venue à la porte,
toute nue avec son petit peignoir.
C'est la nana de ton oncle,
mais elle vient t'ouvrir à poil ?
Elle faisait tout le temps ça avec moi.
Elle m'allumait. Vous savez
comment sont les nanas. Peut-être pas.
J'en sais rien.
En tout cas, je lui fais :
"Tu me laisses pas entrer ?"
Elle dit : "Non." Elle devait se préparer,
mon oncle devait passer.
Donc je lui ai donné la coke.
Elle a ri en disant qu'elle allait
la mettre à refroidir pour après.
La mettre au frigo.
Je sais pas pour le frigo. Je suis pas rentré.
J'ai fait demi-tour pour retourner à la voiture
et j'ai entendu un coup de feu.
Wee-Bey est revenu en courant avec son .45
dont il adore tant se servir.
Il m'a dit qu'il avait frappé doucement
à la fenêtre.
Avec la lumière allumée,
elle a dû s'approcher
parce qu'elle voyait pas
ce qu'il y avait dehors.
Une fois à la fenêtre, elle a regardé...
C'est bien, D'Angelo.
Oui.
Vous comprenez pas.
Vous pigez pas.
On grandit dans cette merde.
Mon grand-père, c'était Butch Stamford.
Vous savez qui c'était, Butch Stamford ?
Toute ma famille, mon père,
mes oncles, mes cousins,
c'est notre boulot.
On vit dans cette merde
jusqu'à ce qu'on respire plus.
Je vous jure, j'ai fait huit mois de taule,
et j'étais plus libre
derrière les barreaux que chez moi.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
Je veux que ça s'arrête.
- Je ne peux pas...
- Je veux ce que voulait Wallace.
Je veux repartir à zéro.
Voilà ce que je veux. Où ? Je m'en fiche.
N'importe où. J'en ai rien à foutre.
Je veux juste aller quelque part
où je respirerai comme tout le monde.
Si vous me donnez ça,
je vous les balance.
C'est super. Vraiment super.
C'est super. Vraiment super.
Ouais.
À nous de voir.
D'accord.
On a tout élucidé ce soir. Complètement.
Je vais faire éclater cette affaire.
Ça arrange les choses avec Burrell, non ?
Qu'il aille se faire voir.
Mais je crois qu'on a assez
pour impliquer le F.B.I.,
pour voir ce qu'ils en pensent.
Cedric.
Il est au courant pour le fric, Marla.
Depuis longtemps.
En fait, je ne serais pas surpris
qu'il m'ait refilé cette affaire pour ça.
Qu'est-ce qu'il... Que vas-tu...
Il me tient.
Mais je crois pas que je l'intéresse.
Y a trop en jeu.
C'est trop le fouillis.
Un peu comme cette affaire.
Jimmy, je dois dire
que c'est une affaire en or.
Pas seulement à cause de Greggs,
mais parce qu'on a la solution de ça,
et parce que ça va tellement loin.
Les meurtres, l'argent...
J'ai l'impression d'être soûle
depuis que le gosse a commencé à parler.
Tu peux conduire ?
Je peux te déposer.
Tu prendras ta voiture demain.
Non, ça va.
Je vais bien, c'était génial, putain !
Tu veux mettre le F.B.I. Ià-dessus ?
Je te suis.
Je serai désignée procureur adjoint
et on peut y aller à fond, tu vois ?
L'affaire d'une carrière, putain.
En tout cas...
Ronnie, le truc à...
Chez Levy, l'autre jour, j'étais...
Je...
Bon sang, Ronnie, pas ici.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
T'as jamais fait ça
dans le parking de la police, peut-être ?
Nom de nom.
Regardez qui se ramène sans escorte.
La légende vivante du centre-ville,
Roy Brown
en personne.
Et Lester Freamon, du quartier nord.
Putain, ça fait combien de temps ?
Ton pot de retraite, non ?
C'est ça, la retraite ?
Ouais. Putain de placard, hein ?
J'ai demandé à mon chef
quand je verrai un peu de soleil.
Le connard m'a dit :
"Quand ton unité fera des bénéfices."
Mais assez parlé de mon bonheur.
Qu'est-ce qu'il vous faut ?
Il nous faut remonter des appels,
mais pas dans le Maryland.
- À Philadelphie, en Pennsylvanie.
- Faut passer par eux.
On perd une semaine,
ils nous disent que c'est impossible
et faut encore une semaine avant un accord.
C'est un peu plus compliqué
qu'un rapport normal.
On veut une liste de numéros à Philadelphie
ayant appelé ce numéro cette semaine.
- Quel numéro ?
- Celui d'un avocat de dealers, au centre.
CABINET LEVY
Le service des facturations
doit pouvoir faire ça.
Si on peut le faire,
et je dis pas que c'est le cas,
il faudra une à deux semaines.
Merci, Roy.
Lester, c'est pas là
que tu me dis à quel point c'est important ?
Le numéro de Philadelphie nous donne
le mec qui a tiré sur la flic infiltrée.
Je te le dis, Fitz, c'est l'affaire parfaite.
- Tu vas adorer.
- Ça a l'air géant.
Mais comme je t'ai dit, on ne court plus
après les affaires de drogue.
Essaie les Narcos.
Non, ce service est trop lié au nôtre.
Si on fait ça, nos patrons
seront au courant avant la réunion.
Vos patrons sont pas au courant ?
Il y aura qui ?
Moi, un inspecteur du nom de Freamon
et Daniels.
Je me porte garant de Daniels.
Il joue le jeu avec courage sur ce coup.
Allez, prépare-nous un truc.
D'accord.
Je peux avoir dix copies ?
- Dix copies ?
- Dix, oui.
Pas de problèmes ?
Non.
Non ?
D'accord, je t'appellerai.
T'as verrouillé la porte ?
Bon, écoute.
C'est pas encore prêt à la vente.
Chacun doit couper pour faire ses doses.
Dis-leur de bien piger le truc.
Trois fois le volume de ça, d'accord ?
Pour une part de pure, vu ?
Ce sera comme ça jusqu'au nouvel arrivage.
Et tu fais passer le message
qu'on est à nouveau opérationnels.
Tu m'as compris ?
On est opérationnels.
C'est une bonne cible.
Vous avez là une bonne affaire.
Rien qu'avec la violence :
il y a au moins douze meurtres,
dont des témoins à charge.
Si vous nous aidez à caser le petit Barksdale
dans un programme de protection,
on peut y aller à fond.
- Mais rien sur les fournisseurs.
- On enquête encore là-dessus.
L'écoute n'a rien donné sur New York.
Le problème, c'est le protocole
depuis le 1 1 septembre.
On ne peut engager
de nouvelle enquête des Stups
sauf si liée
à des cibles prioritaires du crime organisé.
Comme Cosa Nostra ou les Colombiens.
Ou même les Russes.
Y a pas de Colombiens à Baltimore.
Pas de mafiosi.
Tout ce qu'on a, c'est des mecs du coin
qui jouent à bousiller le Westside.
Oui, mais nous appliquons
le protocole dans tout le Bureau.
Pour vous suivre là-dessus,
il faut une cible du crime organisé
ou mieux, un rapport
à la lutte antiterroriste ou à la corruption.
Avec un truc comme ça,
on peut contacter
l'assistant de notre agent spécial.
Quel genre de corruption ?
J'en sais rien.
Qu'est-ce que vous avez ?
Poot, on est opérationnels ou quoi ?
Où est Roc-Roc et le nouveau matos ?
C'est qui ?
- Onion et ces petits joueurs de renois.
- Onion ?
- Qu'est-ce qu'ils ont, putain ?
- Des capsules jaunes.
Des capsules jaunes ?
Capsules jaunes, les gars.
Capsules jaunes.
- J'ai des capsules jaunes.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fous, enfoiré ?
Qu'est-ce que vous foutez ?
Faites comme vous voulez.
Mais faut finir le boulot.
Vous foutez quoi ?
C'est pas un marché libre, ici.
C'est pas un marché.
T'as rien à vendre.
Tu ferais mieux de soutenir ceux qu'en ont.
- Tu sais quoi ?
- Quoi ?
Fous le camp, salope !
- C'est pour ça qu'on peut pas gagner.
- Pourquoi ?
- Ils se plantent, ils se font cogner.
- On se plante, on part à la retraite.
C'est notre territoire ! Foutez le camp !
Paraît que t'es pas très bonne
comme témoin oculaire.
Comme tout civil.
J'imagine.
On en est où ?
Avec quoi ?
L'affaire, imbécile.
Bon sang, lâche un peu.
Et l'écoute ?
- Allez.
- L'écoute est foutue.
Ils ont déménagé après nos descentes.
Daniels te l'a pas dit ?
Putain, non.
Il me parle que des bons trucs.
Comment vous allez choper
mes agresseurs et tout.
On n'a plus l'écoute mais D'Angelo balance
- et on discute avec le F.B.I. pour...
- Allez vous faire foutre.
Elle veut que j'arrête.
Elle dit que ça vaut pas le coup.
Je lui ai promis d'y penser.
Qu'est-ce que t'en dis ?
J'en sais rien.
Fais ce que tu as à faire.
Mais elle a raison.
Ça vaut pas le coup.
Non ?
Probablement pas.
Au fait, pourquoi t'as mis
si longtemps à venir ?
Pas de carte, pas de fleur, merde.
Qu'est-ce que t'as, Jimmy, putain ?
Je ne pouvais pas...
Je me sentais...
Dans des affaires comme ça,
c'est toujours toi ou Sydnor
ou un autre Black qui infiltre.
Je te jure, si c'était à refaire...
Si je...
Si c'était à refaire,
tu sais ce que je ferais ?
Je mettrais plus de scotch sur mon flingue.
Je suis désolé, Kima.
Je suis désolé.
En tout cas, puisque t'es venu jusqu'ici,
que tu fais la pétasse, tout ça,
que tu te sens minable...
tu peux peut-être me rendre service.
Elle a dit que tu te débrouillais bien.
Elle est fière de toi.
Comment elle va ?
Encore secouée.
Mais elle veut te donner ça
et m'a dit de te dire qu'elle est désolée
pour le retard.
Elle a du coeur, tu sais ?
Ouais.
Ça suffit pour le moment, mec.
Rends-lui le reste.
Tu es sûr ?
Embrasse-la pour moi.
Oui.
McNulty.
Ne lui dis pas.
- Qu'est-ce que t'as, mec ?
- Là-bas.
Putain, incroyable. Cinq mecs sont avancés.
Pas seulement toi.
- Je suis dépassé par quatre autres mecs.
- Je suis désolé, mec.
Ça doit être les plaintes
sur mon comportement.
Même si je réussissais
le putain d'exam, ça changerait rien.
T'en sais rien.
Tu seras peut-être sur la prochaine liste.
T'en sais rien.
Je dois pas avoir les qualités d'un chef.
- Félicitations, Carv.
- Merci.
Ouais ?
Le monde est sur le cul.
Le gars du téléphone a appelé.
Il dit qu'il a le numéro que tu cherches
à Philadelphie.
Superbe, merci.
- Très bonne enquête.
- Merci.
Je ne crois rien révéler
en disant qu'Arnold a un dossier
sur le sénateur Davis
depuis deux ans et demi.
Il nous a fallu un moment pour le voir,
mais l'échange est là,
dans ce foutoir
du développement du Westside.
Barksdale, ou ses couvertures,
graisse la patte aux politiques
et est au courant avec des années d'avance
des nouvelles zones de développement.
Il rachète
toutes les merdes immobilières possibles,
revend deux ou trois fois
en exagérant la valeur.
La Ville va le payer des millions
pour condamner les propriétés
avant de rénover.
Ça fait un sacré boulot,
mais on est d'accord.
À savoir si votre coopérateur
peut nous donner le sénateur
ou tout autre homme politique ?
- Notre coopérateur ?
- D'Angelo Barksdale.
Qu'est-ce qu'il peut nous donner
sur l'argent ?
Rien.
Il vous donne la drogue et les tueurs.
Il vous donne Avon Barksdale, Stringer Bell.
- Qui nous donneront le sénateur.
- Peut-être, oui.
Vous voulez faire coopérer Barksdale et Bell
et faire des politiques la cible numéro un ?
Bien sûr.
Non, rien à foutre des politiques.
C'est Barksdale et Bell.
Non, rien à foutre des politiques.
C'est Barksdale et Bell.
Ces mecs ont fait
du quartier ouest une zone de combat.
Et ils le paieront.
Vous dites que si on vous donne l'affaire,
vous allez laisser
réduire les sentences de Barksdale et Bell
s'ils coopèrent ?
Bon sang, vous rigolez ?
Vous comprenez tout à l'envers, putain.
Inspecteur, le but de ce bureau
est de poursuivre la corruption politique.
Vous entendez ça ?
- Jimmy, écoute.
- Quoi ?
La drogue, les meurtres, ça compte plus ?
Et le terrorisme ?
Ces mecs ont fait 14, 15 morts.
Des témoins, des coopérateurs...
Ce genre d'hyperbole
n'arrange rien, inspecteur.
Je crois qu'on va choisir une autre voie.
Merci de nous avoir reçus.
Le quartier ouest crève et ces costards vides
se démènent pour épingler un politicien.
Je croyais que vous étiez de vrais flics.
Alors, ils t'ont amené jusqu'ici ?
Je croyais que t'étais au New Jersey.
T'y étais pas.
Je me suis dit
que tu devais être resté au poste.
Mais ici.
Ils font passer un message.
Oui, c'est nécessaire.
Comment tu m'as retrouvé ?
Rien ne peut empêcher une mère
de voir son fils.
Tu sais, il parle toujours de la famille.
Il dit que la famille est au coeur de tout.
Je suis de la famille, moi,
non ?
Et moi alors, pour une fois ?
C'est pas juste.
Qu'est-ce qui est juste ?
Tu veux qu'il s'avance,
qu'il prenne tout sur lui, qu'il te disculpe ?
Il le fera. Tu le sais.
Mais s'il s'en va,
alors tu devras le remplacer.
T'es prêt à le faire ?
Maman, tu sais bien que non.
Je suis pas prêt
et je le serai jamais pour ce jeu-là.
- Dee, arrête.
- Écoute.
Ils me donnent la possibilité de partir,
de recommencer ailleurs.
Et tu leur donnes quoi ?
Écoute...
Il a merdé, Dee. Il le sait.
Si tu veux te venger, tu peux.
Mais si tu lui fais du tort,
tu feras du tort à toute la famille.
À nous tous. À moi, à Trina et aux cousins.
À Donette aussi. Et à ton bébé.
Ton petit garçon.
Ça fait partie de ce jeu-là, Dee.
Et sans ce jeu-là,
Ia famille vivrait
dans la putain de cité Franklin,
de trois fois rien.
Si ça se trouve,
y aurait même pas de famille.
Recommencer ?
Comment tu vas recommencer
sans ta famille ?
Sans ton enfant, même ?
Si t'as pas de famille dans la vie,
qu'est-ce qui te reste ?
L'enfoiré de Wee-Bey a pas intérêt à bouger,
sinon y aura même pas de procès.
Inspecteur Carver, je peux vous parler ?
Fermez la porte.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a, lieutenant ?
Vous avez pas un truc à me dire ?
Ça fait maintenant des semaines
que le préfet adjoint aux opérations
sait ce qui se passe ici avant moi.
Sauf que la semaine dernière,
on a mis un micro
dans le bureau du club de Barksdale
et pour une fois,
Burrell n'était pas au courant.
Vous voyez pourquoi ?
- Peut-être qu'il...
- Moi, je vois pourquoi.
Je regarde dans le bureau
et je vois qu'un de mes hommes
entre en formation à l'académie.
Je vous jure que c'était pas mon idée.
Je fais mon truc, putain, je fais mon boulot,
et le type m'appelle pour prendre un café.
J'ai jamais été au 8e étage
de ce putain de bâtiment.
Et je vois le préfet adjoint
qui me raconte qu'il s'inquiète de l'affaire,
qu'il a besoin d'être informé.
C'est le préfet adjoint, putain.
Dans deux semaines,
vous serez quelque part dans une division
où vous aurez 1 1 ou 1 2 hommes
qui chercheront votre approbation.
Certains seront de bons policiers.
Certains seront jeunes et bêtes.
Et certains seront de vrais salopards.
Mais tous suivront vos pas.
Si vous êtes intègre, ils apprendront à l'être.
Si vous montrez que c'est le boulot
qui compte, il comptera.
Si vous jouez à autre chose,
alors ils feront pareil.
Je suis arrivé dans la division est
et il y avait un connard de lieutenant
voulant être capitaine,
des connards de sergents
voulant être lieutenants.
Et on a fini par avoir des connards d'agents
livrés à eux-mêmes.
Il s'est alors passé des trucs
qu'on regrettera toujours.
Un jour, vous aurez à décider
si c'est vous qui comptez, ou le boulot.
Le jury a rendu son verdict mardi.
Mais vous le saviez, non ?
On a un mandat pour fuite aujourd'hui.
Il y a beaucoup à faire ici.
Mais je ferais attention avec ça.
Il paraît que la gâchette est sensible.
Bloquez-le.
Vous l'avez ? Relevez-le.
Bande de salopes.
- Ses poignets.
- Pas la peine de bousiller ma caisse.
Ces connards ont du bol.
Oui ?
Un petit avocat de chez Denton fait tout
pour pas qu'on change D'Angelo
de sa juridiction d'origine.
Passe l'appel.
D'accord.
Agent Mace, ici l'adjointe du procureur
Pearlman, y a un problème avec l'avocat ?
D'accord, passez-moi ce connard.
Lui-même.
Vous ne me facilitez pas les choses.
Je dois dire que je suis ambivalent.
- Pardon ?
- Asseyez-vous.
Asseyez-vous !
- Tenez.
- Bunk m'a dit.
Philadelphie. Beau boulot.
Vous avez tous bien bossé.
Et le taux d'affaires classées que je vois là...
Pour la première fois de l'année,
on passe au-dessus de 40 %.
Voilà pour un côté.
Mais de l'autre, je sais
que le préfet adjoint a eu un appel
du procureur général ce matin
demandant si un connard comme vous
travaillait bien pour nous.
Bien sûr, c'est la première fois
que l'adjoint apprend
que ses hommes bossent dans son dos
avec le F.B.I.,
alors qu'on leur a déjà dit
que l'affaire est classée.
Vous êtes un bon inspecteur.
Et je dois dire que vous avez du cran.
Vous avez vraiment traité le procureur
de costard vide ?
Je veux vous voir bien atterrir, Jimmy.
Alors dites-moi où vous ne voulez pas aller.
Nous savons tous que les jurés de Baltimore
sont capables de tout.
Si vous voulez passer des mois
à écouter des conversations téléphoniques
à peine audibles et voir où ça vous mène,
- je respecte votre dévouement.
- Il n'y a pas que l'écoute.
On a saisi de l'argent et beaucoup de came.
Plus les agressions.
Dont aucune n'implique M. Barksdale.
Vous le savez.
Aucune, sauf la saisie du New Jersey.
Celle-là, il se la prend.
Peut-être.
Il plaidera peut-être
la tentative de possession
et prendra quoi, trois, quatre ans.
Il peut s'arranger
pour que tous ceux que vous avez
sur ces bandes fassent de même.
Vous aurez peut-être des sentences
de cinq ans pour ceux sans antécédents,
dix ans pour ceux qui en ont
et quinze ans pour deux ou trois.
Et les meurtres ?
On reconnaît peut-être
que vous tenez M. Brice
pour le meurtre d'Orlando Blocker
et l'agression de l'agent.
- Qui ?
- Wee-Bey.
Représentant M. Brice,
je suis assez sûr
que pour éviter la peine de mort,
il offrira d'avouer au moins six
de vos meurtres non classés.
Sans donner de complices ?
Pour ce genre de coopération,
je serais partante pour la perpétuité.
Non, en effet.
Je crois que M. Brice est prêt
à endosser seul la responsabilité
de tous ses crimes.
Mais vous vous en sortez
avec six meurtres élucidés.
Et les biens.
Prenez le club de strip-tease,
les camions et voitures
que vous pouvez relier au trafic de drogue
et l'argent saisi.
Il a des douzaines d'autres propriétés :
les pompes funèbres, le remorquage.
Non, vous prenez les voitures,
qu'on peut lier à une activité illégale.
Non, vous prenez les voitures,
qu'on peut lier à une activité illégale.
Mais il n'y a rien d'autre à prendre.
Donc vous gardez la majorité de l'argent,
de l'immobilier
et Stringer Bell reste libre
et aux commandes.
Si vous avez un chef d'accusation
contre M. Bell, allez-y.
Sinon, il me semble que rien
dans ces enregistrements ne le concerne.
Trois ou quatre ans, c'est pas assez, Maury.
Pas pour Avon Barksdale.
Non ?
Faites une offre.
La séance de la section 14
du tribunal de Baltimore est ouverte.
- Asseyez-vous.
- Première affaire.
- Asseyez-vous.
- Première affaire.
Affaire Avon Randolph Barksdale,
Votre Honneur.
Possession avec intention de revente
d'un kilo d'héroïne.
- Déclaration des faits ?
- Oui, Votre Honneur.
M. Barksdale propose de plaider coupable
en échange d'un maximum
de sept ans de détention,
en considération des faits établis suivants :
vers le 17 septembre 2002,
dans cette juridiction du comté d'Essex,
New Jersey,
I'agent Robert Warren
de la caserne de Newark
a effectué l'interception
d'une Ford Taurus de location
qui se dirigeait au sud vers la sortie n° 13.
Interception faite
à la suite de renseignements
recueillis après surveillance de M. Barksdale
et de son neveu D'Angelo Barksdale,
par des inspecteurs d'une mission spéciale
sous l'égide
d'un chef de la brigade des stupéfiants.
La fouille du véhicule, loué à l'agence Avis
de l'aéroport de Baltimore,
a permis de trouver
un kilo d'héroïne quasi pure
dissimulé derrière la roue de secours
dans le coffre.
En plaidant ainsi, M. Barksdale
admet son rôle dans l'obtention
de la drogue et l'intention de la couper
et conditionner pour la vente au détail...
Deidre Kresson, Roland Leggett,
Toreen Boyd, tous avec la même arme.
Et les gamins du casse :
Brandon Wright, John Bailey.
Avec Orlando, ça fait six.
Plus la tentative de meurtre d'un policier.
C'est tout ?
- Je ferai mieux si j'en donne encore ?
- Perpétuité sans remise de peine.
Cette offre vous sauve de la peine de mort.
C'est tout.
Vous étiez du mauvais côté
quand on a tiré sur ce flic.
Pour une sentence à perpète normale
pour ces morts,
il faudrait nous parler d'Avon Barksdale
- et de Stringer Bell.
- Non.
Mais pour les meurtres,
autant donner ce que vous avez,
parce que ce que vous n'avouez pas
ne sera pas négocié.
Si on le découvre plus tard,
on pourra vous en accuser.
Rien à foutre, alors.
Pour un autre burger
et une salade de pommes de terre,
je vous en donne d'autres.
- Quelle cuisson ?
- À point, avec beaucoup de raifort.
Bon, j'ai buté Little Man,
pensant qu'il regretterait
d'avoir tiré sur le flic.
Ah oui ? Où est le corps ?
Druid Hill. Derrière le pavillon des reptiles.
Si vous y allez,
vous trouverez peut-être des restes.
Bon, ça fait sept. Quoi d'autre ?
Et les témoins ?
La gardienne et comment il s'appelle,
le type de l'entretien ?
Gant ?
Ouais, Gant.
Tu as tué Gant tout seul ?
Plus de salade de pommes de terre.
Salade de choux ?
Les renseignements recueillis
pendant la surveillance
montrent aussi qu'un M. Watkins,
alias Ronnie Moe
était impliqué dans la distribution
d'héroïne et de cocaïne dans les tours,
au 734 Fayette et 221 au nord de Fremont.
En échange de plaider coupable
pour complicité,
il accepte une sentence
ne dépassant pas 15 ans de détention.
M. Watkins, en conditionnelle
d'une condamnation pour trafic
décidée au tribunal par le juge Prevas
en août 2001 ...
Cedric !
Major Cantrell.
- Félicitations.
- Merci.
- Où on t'envoie ?
- Nord-ouest. Spurgeon prend sa retraite.
- C'est ce que j'avais entendu.
- Si t'as envie de bouger, appelle-moi.
J'aurais besoin d'un bon lieutenant.
En ce moment, le district est un vrai foutoir.
Qu'est-ce qui ne l'est pas ?
- Content de t'avoir vu.
- Moi aussi.
Vous voyez, c'est pas les Narcos ici.
C'est pas comme ça.
Quand vous êtes arrivés en ville,
le boulot a changé.
Ici, on traite de grosses affaires,
des trucs balèzes,
comme l'affaire Barksdale, vu ?
Et ce foutoir qu'on appelle
boulot de flic dans les divisions,
tous ces coups gratuits et ces bavures,
ça marche pas ici.
Vous croyez que je rigole.
C'est ça qui fait une affaire, messieurs.
Ça !
Souvenez-vous-en.
Bien joué.
Enfoiré, j'attends depuis midi.
Personne n'est passé.
Tu m'entends ?
J'attends et vous êtes pas là.
Écoute, écoute-moi.
Si c'est ce que tu penses, raccroche
et viens me voir ici.
Ouais, c'est ça.
Si Roc-Roc est pas là dans dix minutes
avec mon matos,
je lui casse la gueule, mec.
Je sais que vous avez déjà
fait partie de la Crim,
mais je vous explique comment je dirige,
car c'est comme ça que ça marche.
On fait une rotation.
Vous partez en mission,
ensuite, vous rentrez,
et l'équipe d'après prend la relève.
C'est comme ça qu'on travaille dans
une ville avec 250 à 300 meurtres par an.
Et ça marche.
Vous ne jouez pas perso,
vous jouez pour nous.
Si vous observez ces quelques règles,
je vous soutiendrai et je serai raisonnable.
Très raisonnable.
- C'est ce qu'on dit de moi.
- Oui, il paraît.
Hé, Dink !
C'était quoi, ce bordel ?
Tu prends le fric d'un renoi et tu le sers ?
C'est quoi ce cirque ?
Tu prends le fric,
et tu les envoies
se faire servir par un autre keum.
Comme tu le fais,
un mec qui prend des clichés a tout le deal.
Tu piges ?
Faut pas déconner ici !
Jimmy.
Sacrée affaire.
J'ai tout lu dans les journaux.
Tu t'es bien débrouillé.
Je dois...
D'Angelo Barksdale
supervisait la distribution
dans la cour des pavillons
et il est aussi impliqué
dans les agressions attribuées
à cette bande.
De plus, il est arrêté
par les autorités du New Jersey
en possession d'un kilo d'héroïne pure
destiné à la revente sur Baltimore.
Il reconnaît son rôle de complice
et bénéficie déjà d'une remise de peine
de deux condamnations
pour trafic remontant à mars 1999.
Que requérez-vous ?
M. Barksdale ayant déjà été condamné
deux fois et affirmant que l'achat
et le transport du kilo
ont été faits sous son ordre,
refusant par ailleurs de coopérer
contre d'autres complices,
nous requérons le maximum,
c'est-à-dire 20 ans, Votre Honneur.
M. Levy, c'est ainsi que vous comprenez
la négociation de peines ?
- Oui, M. Ie juge.
- Très bien, M. Barksdale.
- M'entendez-vous distinctement ?
- Oui.
Êtes-vous sous l'emprise de l'alcool...
- Wee-Bey, mec.
- Alors ?
Pour perpète sans remise de peine,
il endosse Orlando
et la tentative de meurtre sur Greggs.
Il prend aussi Nakeisha Lyles,
Deidre Kresson, les deux meurtres
dans la cité de la même arme,
Ies deux gosses du casse et Little Man.
Little Man ?
Son corps était derrière
le pavillon des reptiles de Druid Hill.
Il nous l'a donné pour s'amuser, celui-là.
Et il prend William Gant.
Je sais, c'est des conneries.
Qu'est-ce qu'il a raconté ?
- Boum.
- Il a dit à bout portant ?
Ça colle pas. Gant n'avait pas
de compression, de marque.
La blessure était au front.
Bey raconte des craques.
Je sais, mais cet enfoiré
endosse les meurtres pour s'amuser.
Perpète sans remise de peine
pour avoir tiré sur un flic ?
Autant dégager Bird du meurtre de Gant.
Levez-vous.
Putain, qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ?
T'es contente, salope ?
C'est toi qu'as des maxi six ?
- T'en veux combien, putain ?
- Disons trois ou quatre cents.
Putain.
Ça fait partie du jeu, mec.
Ouais, mais je pensais pas...
C'est ça.
Anybody in plumbing,
please go to aisle four.
God damn!
Ah, I see you got
the DeWalt cordless.
Your nail gun--
DeWalt 410.
Yeah. The trouble is,
you leave it
in a truck for a while,
need to step up
and use the bitch,
the battery don't hold up,
you know?
Yeah, cordless'll do that.
You might want to consider
the powder-actuated tool.
The Hilti DX 460 MX
or the Simpson PTP--
these two
are my Cadillacs.
Everything else on this board
is second-best, sorry to say.
Are you contracting, or just doing
some work around the house?
- No, we work all over.
- Full time?
No, we had about
five jobs last month.
Ah. With that rate,
the cost of the powder-actuated guns
justifies itself.
- You say "power"?
- Powder.
- Like gunpowder?
- Yeah.
The DX 460 is fully automatic,
with a.27-caliber charge.
Wood, concrete,
steel to steel--
she'll throw a fastener into anything.
And for my money,
she handles recoil better than
the Simpson or the P3500.
Now, you understand
what I mean by recoil?
Yeah, the kickback.
I'm with you.
- That's right.
-.27 caliber, huh?
Yeah, not large
ballistically,
but for driving nails,
it's enough.
Any more than that,
you'd add to the recoil.
Man, shit. I seen
a tiny-ass.22 round-nose
drop a nigga
plenty of days, man.
Motherfuckers get up
in you like a pinball,
rip your ass up.
Big joints, though--
big joints, man,
just break your bones,
you say, "Fuck it."
I'm gonna go with this right here, man.
How much I owe you?
$669 plus tax.
No no, you just pay
at the register.
Nah, man, you go ahead
and handle that for me, man.
And keep the rest
for your time.
- This is $800.
- So what, man?
You earned that buck
like a motherfucker. Keep that shit.
- We good?
- Yeah, man.
The man said if you
want to shoot nails,
this here is
the Cadillac, man.
He mean Lexus,
but he ain't know it.
- Hold the charge better?
- Man, fuck the charge.
This here is gunpowder-activated,
.27 caliber,
full auto, no kickback,
nail-throwing mayhem, man.
Shit right here is tight.
Fuck just nailing up boards.
We could kill a couple motherfuckers
with this right here.
You laughing. I've been schooled, dog.
I'm trying to tell you.
- All right, all right.
- For real.
Seven and counting.
All of them
caught on the wire.
We're not above the corners yet,
but we soon will be.
- They're not dumping phones?
- Every month or so.
Sloppy enough that we may be able
to track a phone or two
up to Marlo or the people
he keeps close.
Truth is, if they're
still using cell phones
in this day and age,
they're mine.
And if Marlo Stanfield
is on a cell,
- he'll be mine too.
- Cool Lester smooth.
That's not trash talk, darling.
That's simple fact.
Marlo Stanfield may have a lot of heart
and a lot of corners,
but he's a babe
in the woods
when it comes
to this right here.
I was proud to be chasing those
Barksdales, but this Stanfield kid...
Not as fierce
as we thought.
For months now, there hasn't been
a body we can put to him.
- Hmm.
- You two sound disappointed.
This unit needs good, hard targets,
or it'll go soft.
Be that as it may,
I'll assume you want
- another 30 days on your taps.
- At least.
And we've got subpoenas
to go out this week as well.
- Subpoenas?
- Asset investigations.
- On Marlo Stanfield?
- Come here.
All this is
from the Barksdale money trail.
We've been running
down all the paper
we pulled out of
Stringer's apartment
and the B & B
office downtown.
- I miss Prez, man. I do.
- I hear you.
The truth is, those guys had
money going everywhere--
investments, political donations,
consulting fees...
You want to do this now?
I wanted to do
this a year ago,
but fresh cases
got in the way.
And your lieutenant's gonna
okay this kind of paper?
Our lieutenant has
a fearless heart.
- This will get you started.
- Whoa whoa whoa.
Wait wait wait.
Wait right there.
My coupons.
You were gonna give
this lady my coupons.
Been clipping them
for two days,
and you damn near sent them out
with your mess.
Well, why are they
in my pile?
Why is your pile
in my workspace?
Because I'm doing
real work!
Working my nerves
is what you've been doing.
Four weeks before
the Baltimore City primary,
you hand me a stack
of drug-money subpoenas
that hit a dozen
key political figures.
There's an election:
Who's running?
...and they think I can't.
Shit, I don't think we can
take four more years of this guy.
This city's in the toilet.
That's what they said
during my term, too.
Yeah well, you got
dealt a bad hand,
- I mean, with the riots and all.
- Yeah, sure.
Anyway, I think
I'll squeeze in
if Tony Gray draws off
25%, 26% of the vote,
because most of that's
out of Royce's base.
25% is a big number for Gray,
don't you think?
I don't know.
Royce's negatives are up--
even among black voters.
Yeah.
In a minute, Norman.
You know what
I think, Tommy?
No matter what,
you got your name out there,
and it'll help you
down the road
if you ever want to step up
to the legislature.
But as one paisan to another,
the day of the white mayor
is over in this town.
Excuse me,
Your Eminence.
You're due at the Baylor-Edison
Senior Center,
and I don't want to be lying
to a roomful of wrinkle-assed voters
because you wanted to talk shop
all the damn morning.
Seniors, huh?
They vote, Tommy.
Got to run. Sorry.
The candidate's on your clock.
Don't ever let him forget it.
No, indeed.
Need your sig
on vehicle logs
and a corrected court report
and office memo
subpoena requests
and a requisition due
to City Purchasing for a large fan.
A fan, huh?
Caroline says it stays hot
in the wire room
with the door closed.
Oh. It's beautiful,
Lieutenant.
- I've never seen a beach house so fine.
- You think so?
Shit. Makes me think
about retirement,
and I only got
nine years on.
When do you break ground?
Next March,
if I have my permits,
which reminds me--
on Tuesday,
I have to get over to Delaware
and see my contractor.
Oh, no problem.
Me and Lester, we'll cover for you
on that. No problem at all.
Cake.
You know what
I'm saying, yo?
That's my baby's mother
we talking about, yo.
But y'all been broke up,
right?
Man, I ain't living
with her or nothing,
but I still be giving her
a couple dollars here and there,
you know,
stop and pass.
Pandemic! Pandemic!
Look at this.
Hey, Nay.
- Namond!
- Hmm:
What the fuck am l
paying you for, nigga?
Oh, my fault, B.
Damn!
Yo man, and do something
with that ponytail.
Cops can make his ass
from a mile away.
Braid it or something!
Yeah, you know, me and Patrice
been together for a long time.
Yeah, but you say she running
with the boy Fruit now, right?
Yeah. If he don't back
the fuck off,
I'm gonna fill his ass
with some hot ones, yo.
Shit. You don't
think I will?
I got that pandemic.
Man...
do what you gonna do.
- Bodie.
- What's up, big man?
You ain't real with us
all week, man.
You stepping
on that package or what?
Yo, man,
everything's slow.
It been slow since we moved
down here from Fayette Street.
Yeah, well,
Marlo wanted Fayette.
Man, I do not like backing down
from niggas, man.
I feel like a punk.
I feel like doing shit.
Ain't like
the old days, dog.
Mayor Barksdale left.
You out here
on your own, dog.
Give it up.
B, let's roll.
Hey, Lex, man,
I'm gonna give you the truth
because you need the truth.
That boy Marlo got
the world by the ass.
And Fruit,
he work for Marlo.
So I'm saying,
fuck that bitch.
Pfft.
And move on.
- That's just the way it is.
- Yeah.
- That's just the way it is, man.
- Pandemic!
Thank you, sir.
Just one moment,
ma'am.
You seen Hoskins?
Lieutenant went
upstairs already.
Step through, please.
Madam President.
Council president's
hot as balls.
- I'd fuck you to fuck her, man.
- Yeah?
You'd fuck a guy for a chance
to fuck a hot broad?
You don't think that makes you
a faggot or nothing?
It's just
an expression, man.
Been on this detail
how long?
Eight months.
Eight months
with Clarence Royce.
So let me ask,
are you ready to take a bullet
for the Mayor of Baltimore?
Lieutenant, sir.
Is the truck okay,
or do we want to call one?
No, the truck works.
He said he needed
just 10 minutes.
No, not now.
Maybe tomorrow.
Is that Krawczyk again?
Every time he writes
another check,
he turns around
and calls for something
just to see that he can.
Getting calls
from Carcetti's people, too.
They want one debate
for crime and safety,
the other on economic stuff
and schools,
Tony Gray crying
the same blues.
Like they're gonna
get the whole night
to smack me
with the crime rate.
I told "The Sun" paper
we're open to any format,
which we'll be
for another couple days or so,
in which time we'll say,
"Fuck you. One debate."
Two debates. Shit!
That lost-ball-in-high-grass
motherfucker Carcetti.
He needs to get used to
life in the wilderness,
and not just
the downtown areas,
but your communities here
on the East Side.
We stand
or we fall together,
and I'm here today to ask
for the chance to stand with you.
Thank you
for your time.
Questions?
Yes, ma'am?
Is it the Salisbury steak
for lunch today,
or is they doing tacos?
Because it's developments
like this one,
planned residential towers
with waterside retail space
and restaurants
that grow Baltimore's tax base
and help rebuild our city.
I want to thank Ed Bowers
for his vision,
but more important,
for his commitment--
for his commitment
to the City of Baltimore.
Ed.
Mr. Mayor,
I want to thank you
and your administration,
for making this next stage
of redevelopment
for Baltimore's harbor
a reality.
You talk about vision
and commitment--
Mayor Clarence Royce.
Pandemic! Pandemic!
What up, Nay?
Yo, what up?
- What you got?
- Nothing.
It's just a story about
A.J. from North & Woods.
Yo, you know
they gave him 700 years?
Read this shit, son.
This corner is dead, man.
You still working?
Yeah, because we was gonna
gonna go under the road
- and catch some fresh birds.
- I don't know.
Let me see if I can bounce.
Hold up.
- Hey, B.
- What's up?
I wanted to know
if I could leave early
because me and the fellas
want to go down to Mondawmin
for some back-to-school stuff.
What you need
back-to-school stuff for?
Your ass stay suspended.
Come on,
stop playing, B.
Hey, if it wasn't
for social promotion,
your ass would still be
in pre-K, motherfucker.
Probably daycare
up this bitch.
Pandemic right here!
Fuck it.
Hey, yo, man.
Pay this late-to-work, early-to-play
nigger out for five hours, yo.
Yo, you owe me extra time
tomorrow, though.
Lex! Did you hear me?
Damn, y'all!
Young'uns don't got a scrap
of work ethic nowadays, man.
If it wasn't for his pops,
I wouldn't even bother.
Yo!
Make sure you come
early tomorrow
because it ain't always
gonna be this slow.
Pandemic!
At least
I hope it ain't.
Mr. Mayor.
Mr. Mayor, excuse me.
I just want to make sure
we're still okay
for that median cut
on Boston Street.
I really need that access
to make the site viable.
Right. I'll get
my people on it.
Thank you, sir.
Something going on
with his median?
Not once he ponies up.
I think he can do a lot better
than the 4,000,
don't you?
I don't even
want to know.
No, Chris, please, man.
We're low
on quicklime, man.
Doesn't matter.
We got vacants on both sides.
He'll stink is all.
Chris, please.
Don't fret, boss.
I got you covered.
Quick and clean,
I promise.
Chr--
Man, shit like that don't even
work in them cartoons.
The roadrunner just snatch
the birdseed and book.
- We ain't in no cartoon.
- Yeah, you is.
Shh! Be still.
Yeah, you scaring away
the birds.
I'm talking to both y'all.
Took me off the clock
for this craziness?
- What the fuck is you thinking?
- We're serious, Nay.
This bird could be worth
like 300 or 400.
Nigga, please.
Yo, you know the boy Nemo
who worked Marlo's pigeon coop?
Said he got 400
for a white homing bird.
- And that's a homer?
- I mean, it's white.
- So that makes it a homer, right?
- It could be.
Damn! Son, you need to put
some hamburger meat in that trap.
That shit would've been got.
Shut your mouth,
it'd have been got.
I'm gonna fuck
this nigga up.
Hey yo, what the fuck
is wrong with you,
throwing bottles
and shit, huh?
You just cost us cash money,
you know that?
I ain't done nothing.
You're a seriously backwards dude.
You know that, right?
Playing with bugs
like he's still in Pampers.
That wasn't even necessary.
Nah, you don't want
any Pampers.
Put them over
that mouth you got.
Catch all that shit
you be flushing.
- Ohh!
- Ooh!
Y'all be stinking
like rat fart.
There you go!
- Oh oh!
- Get him!
All right, all right.
Come on, come on,
come on. Come on.
Y'all acting like
little bitches.
Yo, you seen
my man Duke?
Clocked him, got him
upside his head.
Only because I didn't
want to get too close
and touch
the dirty motherfucker.
Could have come up with AlDS
or some shit like that.
Dukie fight
like a bitch, yo.
I would have whipped that ass
if I didn't feel sorry for him.
Duke, man,
you scared away the birds.
I blew me up
a bug bomb.
You want to come
and see the pieces?
Nah, I'm good.
I got to go.
All right.
Hey hey, Randy.
That pigeon
wasn't a homer.
Homers got them metal things
around their leg.
That way you can tell them
from the other birds.
How you know that?
You know Nemo let me clean
out his coop sometimes.
So... he was schooling me.
...which leaves us
a total of 54.
No surprises on who's coming back--
all the regulars.
We lost Mr. Parker
and Ms. Bowles.
- Gregory's leaving?
- Hired by the county.
And Bowles, I knew
she wasn't coming back,
the way they tore up
her classroom.
So we're short two in math
and four in science.
Man at the door.
No system l.D.,
but says he's new here.
Well, buzz him in before
something changes his mind.
All the way
on the left.
Pull it hard.
- Hard!
- It's locked.
All right.
I'll be right down.
Not a goddamn thing up in here
works like it should.
Well, you turn to
the cafeteria assignments,
and you see that's gonna leave
Ernest alone for second period,
and he can't handle it alone.
You tell them, because I ain't even
gonna try to pronounce it.
Roland Pryzbylewski.
Everyone just
calls me "Prez."
Claudell Withers.
I'm principal here.
New in math.
I won't have my certificate
until next year,
but with the resident
teachers' program,
they said I'd be
getting classes
because of staff shortages?
Jesus.
Lambs to the slaughter here.
What did you do before you decided
to teach, Mr. Pryzbylewski?
I was a police...
in the city.
Marcia Donnelly,
Assistant Principal.
Welcome to
Edward Tilghman Middle.
That leaves Tullman,
as I see 'em, for the 12th.
You think he can handle
the whole shift?
Now, which one's
Tullman, again?
Goofy redhead, kind of
looks like Opie from Mayberry,
but less fierce.
Jimmy,
Major wants to see you.
Jimmy, come on in.
I know I offered
when I first came over here,
and I know your answer then,
but I'm still asking.
Can I get you
out of a radio car?
No thank you, Major.
McNulty, I'm short
two men in Ops,
and my follow-up squad
couldn't make a case to save its life.
You're too damn good
to be humping calls.
Thanks for the offer,
though.
You don't think I asked him 10 times
when I was acting commander?
He's in the wrong
fucking place.
For us, yeah.
For him...
Yo, po-po, man.
Po-po. Shut it down.
Where is the love, Bodie?
Where is the motherfucking love?
I go back so far
with this kid,
I was chasing him
through juvie.
But does any of that matter
when we roll up here?
I get so much as a wave,
a nod, a smile?
Nothing.
- How about just hello?
- Hello.
See? That wasn't
so hard, was it?
Lex, my man,
how's your day going?
Not to criticize
or anything,
but I think you missed
a spot there.
Little Kevin,
how's it hanging?
Reesey, you look like
someone just shot your dog.
You all right, man?
You okay?
Reesey still messing up
the count?
You hear what he said?
Yo, dog, you send him up
to Lamelle next month.
I'll make sure Ms. Davis
puts him in remedial math,
and we'll have done
some good here today.
Fucking cop, man.
Everything good?
Yeah. Just words.
Mr. Entrapment,
how you doing?
Don't look like that.
I'm still dining out on that story.
You know how he beat
the wiretap a year ago?
Claimed entrapment when he was clocking
in Bunny Colvin's Hamsterdam.
Shit you not.
Smart kiddo.
I loved it.
When I roll back in an hour,
this corner's bone-dry.
Your people are done
for the day.
Okay.
So let's try this again.
I say, "Have a good evening,
Mr. Broadus."
And a good evening to you,
Sergeant Carver.
See?
We're right here.
And a very good evening
to you, Officer Colicchio.
Fuck yourself with a 40,
shitbreath.
What the fuck
was all that about?
- You can't bust every head, Tony.
- I can't?
Bust every head, who are you
gonna talk to when the shit happens?
Hi, Rachel.
- Tim, thanks for doing that yesterday.
- Yeah, no problem.
You ran late all morning--
Late for the seniors, late for
the Stonewall meeting with Della.
Late for the Gay-Lesbian Alliance.
Them seniors,
they talk slow.
Bullshit. It was breakfast
with Young Tony
when they sat there swapping
stories over cold coffee.
- Young Tony, huh?
- I was getting sage advice--
- From a one-term mayor?
- It wasn't his fault.
He takes over in '67,
sees the city burn.
That was an opportunity.
Spiro Agnew made his whole career
on the '68 Riots.
- Agnew?
- One man's shithead's
another man's vice president.
- True today as it ever was.
- Hey, is that polling data?
Raw numbers.
It's incomplete.
Right now, you need to be
in the call room dialing for dollars.
Aw, fuck!
I can't do it anymore!
I hate it. I hate it
more than anything.
- I fucking hate it!
- You don't do this,
you don't have the money to pay
for the damn TV spots
in the last two weeks.
Aw, mothersucking
cockfuckers.
Oh, Jesus.
I fucking hate this.
Hey there, Jim.
Tom Carcetti here,
remember me?
We met at your sister's house--
you know, the one that's married
to that Republican cunt.
I know you
don't remember me.
I know you don't have any use
for fucking politicians,
and frankly, I don't give a flying fuck
about what you think
or what your concerns are.
But I do care about what
your cute little blonde wife
thinks about so many things.
But, Jim, the reason
I'm calling is because
I want you to write me out
a check for $4,000,
the maximum allowed by law.
Because we don't trust you
to actually mail that check,
we're gonna send over a couple
of furloughed DPW workers
to beat the check out of you.
All finished?
You need $30,000...
in the next three hours.
No bullshit, Tommy.
You hit your number
or die in this room.
Yeah, whatever.
So what are you
watching, then?
Anything on the tube?
No fucking way.
They got enough power
in the middle of the lineup.
What they need is pitching.
What you looking at?
Fucking crazy.
Oh, like I'm really gonna give
that motherfucker a ride to Woodlawn.
Shit.
Help! Somebody help!
What's up, Patrice?
You're letting it ring,
right?
You're not hanging up
after a ring or two?
I'm making
the calls, Terri.
I don't know what to say.
Nobody's home.
30,000, Tommy.
You mean Lex, the boy
who used to go with Patrice?
Lester!
He her baby's daddy.
He ain't the first one
to get his spurt.
You ain't got to
talk like that.
Nigga just walked up to him outside
of the Paragon and served him up.
One to the face.
Whap!
Shoot.
He was real cute.
Lex and his nine took all the cute
out of that lazy-eye motherfucker.
Anything on Fruit's phone?
Nothing. I've gone
for two hours.
- Sure.
- It's no problem, though.
Sure. I really
need your help.
- Put me down for four.
- Yeah.
What about your wife?
Think she can
come up with four?
- I don't think we can do eight.
- The kids?
They're in strollers.
I know they're in strollers.
I was kidding.
That's funny.
Yeah, never mind.
4,000 is good.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
One to the left temple.
Close range in a lot
full of club trash,
- but of course, nobody sees a thing.
- Hmm.
- We hear your shooter goes by "Lex."
- Lex?
We were up
on your victim's cell phone, too.
We'll go back through the calls,
send you whatever's there.
Got this from his pocket.
You can pull the numbers from that
as a consolation prize.
This fucks you guys up, don't it?
Losing a guy you had wired?
Nah. We're up on several phones
on the street level.
With or without Mr. Fruit,
we're on our way.
You know, it's strange.
We're not seeing bodies.
This is the first drug hit
in months,
and it's Marlo's boy who falls.
- I thought Marlo was the new power.
- He is.
Shit, he's got everything
from MLK to Fulton now.
How do you hold
that much real estate
without making bodies?
You hear anything more about
this murder on your wire, Lester,
the Bunk expects a call.
Yeah, I know he does.
Oh! The hell with Norris.
You're my real partner, Lester.
My life partner.
Don't tease, bitch.
Look at that
bowlegged motherfucker.
I made him
walk like that.
So who the fuck
is Lex?
Dontrelle's cousin.
Used to be with
Cantel's people.
He working some corner
over the Hilltop now.
He ain't more connected
than that?
And he coming near
one of mine?
Wasn't about no business.
Pussy, man.
Yo, Fruit was into something
that Lex thought was his own.
You say the word, we take off
that whole motherfucking corner
every last one
of them bitches.
What corner are we
talking about, again?
Rag-tag shit up
on Pacer.
Man, they get
their shit from Joe,
but they're
mostly independent.
They gone, Marlo.
Just say so.
That what you think?
Just do them all?
And take their
fucking corner, too.
What do I want with
some off-brand Hilltop corner?
And why I need
to be stacking bodies
when there ain't no one
trying to war with us?
Just Lex.
He did one of ours,
so he got to fall.
Get out, Tommy.
You're done.
Get up, Tommy!
Come on, pretty boy.
Come on.
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.
- Come on. Let's go.
- That's home?
Yeah. That's it.
There we go,
little trooper.
6:30 tomorrow morning.
Don't make me drag you out of bed
like you did yesterday.
Mm-hmm.
Damn, boy,
what happened to you?
Terrace Boys banged me
coming across the tracks
over there by Ramsey Street.
Teron, Manny, Herbie.
Man, all them
Terrace niggas.
They can't whoop on
Dukie like that.
Yeah, I know. Only we can
whoop on Dukie like that.
We've got to step it up,
even this out.
Nah. Fuck even.
We gonna hurt them
twice as bad.
Give 'em a whoop-ass
they ain't gonna never forget.
If we straight-up fight them,
there's as many of them
as there is us-- more even.
So what you saying?
You scared?
Nah, I'm just saying.
If we're gonna hurt them,
we need to think on it.
Do something go past
beating on each other.
You talking guns and shit.
Nah, I ain't talking guns.
What?
Aw, shit.
Randy got an idea.
Hey, Norman.
You know what I had
for dinner last night?
Tuna sub.
I ate in the car.
When I'm finished
writing my memoirs,
that shit'll be in there,
no doubt.
You see what I just ate?
In the car?
A fucking tuna sub.
In order to prevent distemper,
Norman,
you must vary
the candidate's menu.
If you're done chewing,
Iet's give these new
radio spots a listen.
We've seen what Tommy Carcetti
can do at City Hall
as a councilman.
While the current administration
bent to special interests,
Tommy Carcetti
sponsored legislation...
- What?
-...that is protecting jobs at the fort
by preventing the overdevelopment
of our waterfront.
300,000. Great.
Thanks for sharing.
...that prevented budget cuts
to vital city services...
Three and five zeroes--
mayor's latest TV buy,
and it's four weeks out.
- Turn that shit off!
- You don't like the spots?
I read the copy before the studio mix.
I think they're strong.
They're bullshit!
Weak bullshit!
I wouldn't vote for me.
Fuck!
Fuck Royce!
Fuck Tony Gray!
Fuck me!
Where am I going again?
One of those neighborhoods
between Oliver and Middle East.
Middle East. Now, that's
a good name for it-- fucking Fallujah.
Command performance.
Ms. Victorina Simmons.
She holds sway over
two big vote precincts,
no matter who the EDC
is lying down with--
Fucking Royce!
300,000 like it's fucking water.
Then there's also
the Reverend Garnett.
What are they complaining
about today?
Fucking shithole of a city.
Whining bastards,
bitching about the trash
or the crime or this or that.
It's my fucking fault
it went to shit.
These motherfuckers.
- Boss.
- They can bite my bloody ass.
Ms. Simmons.
Reverend Garnett.
Good to see you again.
I had a meeting going on,
but I'm here now, and I know
there's things to see.
We called
and called downtown,
and ain't nothing gets done.
Okay. Show me.
Right this way,
Councilman.
The first thing I want you
to take a look at...
See, you've got to drink a lot.
Think about
the water running.
And that way,
you know--
How the fuck you know what
water running be like, Duke?
Water been off in your house
since last year.
- Man, that's cold.
- Yeah, that's cold, Nay.
Oh, shit.
I'm ready.
Can't go with
niggers watching, yo.
When we call,
he'll send somebody,
most of the time,
and they write it all down
just like he doing now.
But nothing ever gets done.
Come here, Councilman,
I want you to see this.
Now, see them drug boys?
They block
the alleys like this
so the police won't
chase them down there.
- All this trash.
- Mm-hmm.
Rats everywhere.
Houses vacant.
We keep trying to get them
down here and clean this up.
I guess that's
too much like right.
Well, truth is,
Royce won't let the city agencies
take any of
my constituent calls.
But let me see
what I can do.
Come on, let me show you this
down here. Come on.
Yo.
Y'all Terrace niggas know that boy
who go by the name "Deez"?
- Deez?
- Yeah, Deez nuts.
- Aw, fuck.
- Shit.
Yo yo, come on,
come on, come on.
Yeah, come on, get him!
Damn! I knew those bitches
was gonna set us up.
Yeah, fucking say it, bitches.
Don't ever disrespect Terrace.
Damn!
- I fucking pissed myself.
- Fuck!
Over here!
Kick him right behind.
Randy!
This way.
Hey yo,
he went in there!
Remember that phrasing
is a cornerstone
in communicating
with your students.
This applies not only
to the questions you ask
or their comprehension
of the lesson,
but how they perceive
you as an educator.
And where does that begin?
Out loud
and enthusiastically.
I.A.L.A.C.
Let's go.
Once again.
I.A.L.A.C.
And what are we
telling ourselves?
I am lovable and capable.
Now I see
those smiling faces.
...where the listing
on the lower half of the page
indicates some typical
soft-target locations.
An officer alert to the terrorist threat
must ask himself,
"Do I know the location
of my soft targets,
those where large numbers
of civilians congregate?"
--Train terminals,
office buildings, stadiums.
Another hot zone in the classroom
is the pencil sharpener,
where children tend
to congregate and--
I had a pencil sharpener
in my class once.
Antoine Granderson ripped it
from the wall and threw it at me.
I'd like to know what
your lesson plan suggests
when Harold Hounchell sends
a full set of textbooks
through a closed window.
Thank you.
Settle down, everybody.
And for emergency procedures
in the event of
biochemical agents,
you can refer
to Appendix B.
No disrespect
to your appendix,
but if them terrorists
do fuck up the Western,
could anybody even tell?
Some Al-Qaedas were up
on Baltimore Street
planning on blowing up
the chicken joint.
But Apex's crew jacked them up,
took their camels and robes,
buried their ass
in Leakin Park.
At least
that's what I heard.
Hey, y'all want some real terrorists?
You go up on Pencey and Gold.
Hey, guys,
let's maintain our--
You're doing
one heck of a job.
Not another fucking word.
Thank you.
Ahem. So...
Mmm.
You beast.
I can't help it.
You stirred my manhood.
Little Boy Blue.
What the fuck
are you doing here?
I caught one.
Got a street dealer
who goes by the name of Lex.
Lester heard it
on the wire.
Lester's up on the wire:
Shit, boy, you are
out of the loop.
You know this mutt?
Goes by Lex?
He is familiar.
You know who
you should ask? Carver.
- Naw...
- He'd love the job, man.
All right.
Carver it is.
I still feel the need
to pull your coat.
- For what?
- The taste, Jimmy. The taste.
How about you and me hit
a few of our favorite spots?
You know, me on the Glenlivet,
you on the Jamey?
Go see if that train
is still on the track.
Why don't you come round
some night for dinner?
Say hey to Beadie
and the ankle-biters.
Dinner:
...Iocated
in high-rise structures,
as well as residences
are detailed alongside...
Thanks, Santy.
This horseshit?
You serious?
Back to school
for the kids.
Hey. Yo, Namond,
I'll pay you back.
You ain't never
gonna have no money.
Yo, Michael,
they got you?
Ain't nothing
but a scuffle, man.
Everybody made it back,
though, right?
Naw, man, he had to the boss
to get some stitches.
He got hit with a brick.
I see you changed
clothes already.
He had to.
Yo, he was stinking.
Yo, Randy, man, that was
the stupidest thing you ever thought of.
But it was kind of funny
when it happened, though.
You know what I'm saying?
Yo, you want something
before he bounce?
I'm buying.
One for every soldier
that stood tall.
- I was down there.
- Yeah, fuck you, Duke.
So you get out
all right?
Yeah. Hurt my ankle going
around the corner, but--
But you got away, then?
The lieutenant governor
is up in arms
because two Democratic
National Committees...
I know we're way late--
Ain't no thing.
You did good here.
Turn that bullshit off.
You really think they're gonna
vote for the white guy?
Black folk been voting white
for a long time.
You come correct,
we listen.
It's y'all that don't ever
vote black.
Shit, you got
my vote, anyway.
I don't have your vote,
Norman?
You're my deputy
campaign manager,
and I don't have your vote?
Last white man I could vote
for was Bobby Kennedy,
and you ain't no Bobby K.
I thought you just said--
I was speaking in general about
the kindly nature of black folks.
In particular,
I ain't all that kindly.
So you're gonna take
my fucking check
and run with
my fucking campaign--
Well, I do know
who pays me.
Yes, sir!
Oh yes, sir, boss!
Who are you gonna vote for?
Royce? Tony Gray?
One of them brothers.
Yeah yeah yeah.
Don't make me
tell you again.
It's 9:00 sharp, boy.
And I'm smelling
what has to be urine.
What you been at, boy?
Well, we were playing
with Dukie today.
You know how he be
with his clothes and all.
Well, it's good that child
has friends, I suppose.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Get in there.
Come on, now,
give me a break--
Come on, Dougie.
I know it's late,
but I got to come
backdoor like this,
or the agencies
won't do shit.
You know that
as well as I do.
Come on, Tommy...
Come on, Tommy.
Hustle.
This is ridiculous.
Come on, give me a break--
Look, Dougie. Yeah.
I'm sorry to bug you at home,
but this asshole Royce
won't handle a thing
out of my office,
and I need a couple
of alleys cleaned.
Yeah. 1200 block of
Federal Street, both sides;
and then Chester
and Collington
- run in either direction off that.
- Jesus, Tommy.
I know, you're gonna be out
there again in a couple days.
Can you call Frankie
in Special Services
and have him send
a cold patch truck?
Federal street's
a fucking tank trap.
Yeah yeah yeah.
Great. Thanks.
Love to Denise.
Hustle up, Tom.
How you doing?
Good evening.
Hi.
You're over
two hours late, Tommy.
You ain't gonna win
disrespecting your base.
Hold up, Tony.
Look, man.
We got to talk.
I feel the bad about the way
things have turned out,
but right or wrong,
if you're elected,
then I'm gonna do whatever
I can to help you,
and if I get in,
I'm gonna need your help.
I mean, it's not
personal, Tony.
Fuck you, Tommy.
So this is me?
This is you.
Pandemic!
Pandemic! Got that
pandemic right here!
- What's up?
- What's up, man?
I got all this from the Koreans
today at a discount.
When school start, I'll be selling it
for three times that.
Tell you what,
Iet me get them Skittles.
Naw. Do me a favor
for the rest.
Go up the block
and tell Lex
there's a girl
that want to see him
- at the playground behind Fort.
- Girl?
Tell him Patrice say he should come
to the playground after 8:00.
Why don't you
tell him yourself?
Look, dog,
I don't want to be taking
none of Bodie's shit today
about cutting work.
All right?
Just do me that favor.
Pandemic!
Pandemic right here!
For a skinny motherfucker,
he sure do sweat some.
We got to keep
an extra change in the car
so we don't have to come home
in the middle of the day.
Well, we're way past
late now, so...
- Damn it!
- Here, let me.
Hey, Norman.
Maybe I'll go to clip-on
for a while.
Hey, Terri got in
new polling data.
Did you get a bump?
She won't show me anything
till it's all broke down,
but, yeah, I deserve
a bump, don't l?
Four more weeks, Jen.
Quality time
with the wife and kids.
That's what,
four minutes?
More like six.
Six.
Shit, I could have got laid.
Yo. Yo, Chris, l--
I didn't--
Yeah. It's good.
Pandemic!
Pandemic right here!
No Lex.
Where's that skinny mope?
He was here earlier.
Well, fuck it.
We'll come back,
Jack him tomorrow,
no problem.
All right.
Share the sodas, too.
- What's up? What's up?
- Hey.
What's up?
Let me holla at you
real quick.
What up?
- You did like I said?
- Yeah.
Yeah, you must have,
because the nigga
went up the block.
He ain't never
coming back down.
Chris and Snoop-- pow!
What?
Look. Just be cool,
all right?
Our heroes
back from the wars.
Those poll numbers
tallied up yet?
Not too bad, either.
Royce, 35;
you, 26; Gray, 20.
19% undecided.
We're fucked if we haven't moved
any more than that. I need to be at 30,
and I need Tony taking
25 of his points.
Royce's negatives
are way up.
Like what, 34% unfavorable
to 43% favorable?
He's vulnerable.
Geri, understand this.
In order to win,
I need Tony Gray
to take a huge bite
out of Royce's lead-- huge.
Tony's moved, what?
Two points
in the last month:
That poll says one in five voters
hasn't decided anything yet.
Yeah. The first batch of radio spots
worked magic, didn't they?
How much money
we piss away on those?
Look at these First District figures.
I mean, that's my base,
and I'm polling 37%
with 24% undecided?
Fuck me! I'm done!
Tommy, nobody's focused
on this race yet.
We're gonna own
the First.
Christ, look at what Royce
is polling in the Fourth.
No doubt, Tony's got to get
some traction in West Baltimore.
Yeah, he needs
to be rounding 25%
and headed for 30.
And, by the way,
who can tell me when the fuck did
the Sixth District become 64% black?
About five years ago
in the last redistricting,
mostly as I recall,
to give your ass
more white votes
over there in the First.
What the fuck
was I thinking?
A hell of a lot can happen
between now and election day.
I've been ahead further
than Royce is and lost.
I can't win this.
Tommy, where the fuck
you going?
I'm your ride home, man.
The man can
read a poll.
You been drinking?
I'm fine.
Well, you need to be fine
somewhere else.
Park curfew
is midnight.
City's averaging
a murder a day,
and here you are with
Rec and Park rules?
What are you,
a smart ass?
Sorry.
I didn't mean nothing.
Don't I know you?
I'm running for mayor.
Tommy Carcetti,
First District.
I'll be coming back through
in about 20, Councilman.
Do me a favor
and take it down the road.
Randy?
Yes, ma'am.
Ithought he was supposed
to have a breakfast date, right?
I mean, they told me
that last night.
Breakfast:
Is that on the sched:
It isn't,
but the lieutenant told me
that he'd be doing
breakfast with someone
down at the harbor.
I mean, if he ain't,
I could go get this gassed up
at the Fallsway.
I hate this detail, man.
It's off duty.
Lotsa perks.
All this stand around
and wait, you know?
Hoskins says
I do the one year,
and I'll make sergeant
on the next list.
Yeah. They told me,
careerwise,
you can't do better
than drive the mayor.
Shit, if you could
make rank the right way,
I'll still be working
Western drugs.
All right, fuck this,
I'm gonna go look
for the lieutenant.
Anyone comes looking,
I'm back up
on the second floor.
Sir?
I understood
that the mayor
might be going to, uh,
breakfast at the harbor?
With Kweisi.
But, um, that's up
in the air, I thought.
Would you happen to know
where Lieutenant Hoskins is?
Sir?
Lieutenant:
Umm...
You don't look happy,
Detective.
We're about
to raise some hell.
Maybe too much hell.
A state senator,
two councilmen,
the City Development Agency,
all those developers...
Princes of the city.
Lester, tell me
the thought hasn't
crossed your mind
that some kinda shit
could blow
back on us, man.
Do you know what
Theodore Roosevelt said
about hunting grizzly bears?
The thrill is in overcoming
your own fear.
What was the thrill
for the bear?
I should've run every one
of these subpoenas
by my front office.
That's not procedure.
Fuck procedure, Lester.
My boss is running
two points behind
in the polls with
the mayor's support.
How do you think
he's gonna do
if he pisses off Royce
and starts dropping off
incumbent tickets?
Why do you care?
If Demper thinks
I fucked him and he wins,
I will be at Central Booking
covering bail reviews.
If he loses to Bond,
a new front office comes
in and maybe they bounce
the white girl
back to a trial team
and give the Narcotics Division
to one of their own.
It's Baltimore, Lester.
We're missing
a couple of subpoenas.
We are?
Clay Davis
and Andy Krawczyk.
I'm holding those
till October.
Oh, the hell you are.
Lester...
we drop subpoenas
on either of those guys
three weeks
before the primary,
and all hell breaks loose.
That's what I'm sayin'!
Clay Davis is Royce's
deputy campaign chairman,
and the number-two man at
the City Legislative Caucus.
And Krawczyk is his
number-one fundraiser!
You're giving me resumes
and job titles.
I'm just following the money.
And we will follow it...
after the polls close.
We can drop a second batch
of subpoenas.
There is no reason to do
this now and risk--
A year ago, if we had gone
after these records,
City Hall would've
stomped on this unit
and the subpoenas.
And a month from now,
after Royce is reelected,
they'll do us
the same way.
But right now,
with the primary coming,
they gotta worry
about how they look,
how they behave.
Right now, they gotta
worry about scandal.
You told me you wanted
to do this a year ago,
but fresh cases
got in the way.
You told me that.
Oh.
Very clever, Lester.
You got it all figured, huh?
Me:
I'm just the police.
I saw the teachers' union
finally endorsed Royce.
You knew
they were gonna.
What time's
your first appearance?
Today?
I meet up with you guys
at the SoWeBo forum.
And tonight, it's me
and the kids next to Tommy
at the Roland Park fundraiser.
Better speed things along.
A kick in the ass
sometimes helps.
- B-5?
- No, Daddy, D-5.
You sure
you didn't say B-5?
D-5.
What did I hit?
Submarine.
Umm...
E-6.
Miss.
Just gimme 10 minutes.
You seen your
schedule today?
You ain't got
10 minutes.
Norman, I got
this pretty girl's
aircraft carrier boxed in.
- D-4.
- Ow! Hit.
Tommy,
for Christ's sakes.
Is there any way
that I can win?
With the numbers what they are,
is there any way at all?
Right, so if it's just a matter
of playing out the string,
then that's what
I'm gonna do.
That game's pretty much
over, Norman.
But this game--
this game right here--
this one could still
go either way.
H-11,
sweetheart.
Miss. D-3.
So I guess y'all getting
what y'all need?
- Brianna keepin' y'all close?
- She come up with it.
Money comin' through
every month like she say.
A'ight, 'cause I'm standin'
tall up in here.
They don't need
to worry about me
an' I ain't need
to worry about them.
- You a soldier, Bey.
- You know it.
Everything all right
with my fishes?
You'd tell me if
it wasn't, right?
The fish be fine.
I mean, they fish, right?
How I know how they
feelin' about shit?
- De'londa...
- They fine, Bey.
Ask Namond.
Cleaned the tank an' all,
like you say.
- Cleaned the filter, too.
- A'ight, a'ight.
Check you out, though.
Getting some fuzz
up there, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, whatever.
I know when I was
a little kid, boy,
I couldn't wait till
I started shaving.
One of the old heads
on the corner say,
"Hey, little man,
you wanna grow a 'stache?
Next time
you take a piss,
take some of that piss,
get it on
your fingertips,
do like this, here."
Eww! You do it:
You damn right I did it.
Shit.
What's going on with you,
though, son?
Ain't nothing.
School about to start.
So what about Bodie
and his boys?
They treatin' you right?
Yeah, he cool.
Boy, don't lie
to your father.
He don't even show up for work
half the damn time.
- Bodie told me.
- I missed a few days. That's all, Dad.
And what money
you do make,
you waste on nonsense.
And if you think
I'm gonna give you a dime
for your school clothes,
you better think again.
What Bodie
got you doin'?
I'm a runner,
most days.
Everybody got
to start somewhere.
You better listen
to your father.
He ain't tell you 'bout
that hair, though, huh?
Yeah, he said
I gotta get it cut.
I like it this way.
Even the white police
lookin' out from
three blocks away gonna
be able to spot you
from every other nigga
out there.
They gonna hop out and say,
"Look at the boy over there
with the pretty-ass
ponytail. Get him."
You think
I'm bullshitting.
Either you real out there,
or you ain't, Nay.
You see what I'm sayin'?
Let me get some!
Hey, yo! Over here!
- Whoa! $100!
- Thanks, mister!
- Thank you, Mr. Marlo!
- Thank you!
That's my money, yo!
Your name gonna
ring out, man.
Manuel...
Boy, you talk that shit
better'n me
and I been dealin' with
these Mexicans for years now.
Yeah, I don't think
they would call
what I'm speakin'
Spanish, man.
Just a dirty word
or two here or there.
Yeah, well. Once you can
talk to these cats,
the only thing you need
then is a truck, man.
Could be runnin'
your own crew,
pickin' up fresh clients.
I mean,
if we put in together
we could be coverin'
twice the ground,
makin' twice as much.
Nah, man, I got
other obligations.
Oh, right.
You set to be
the new Angelo Dundee.
I near forgot.
I thought
you already went up
to Mondawmin to get
your school shit, man.
Yeah,
but not all of it.
And my boy,
he need to pay
for his own shit
and his little brother, too.
The fuck this look like,
a Social Services office?
You want a check,
go the fuck up Rosemont.
Come on, man,
I'll work for it.
Nay, I took you on outta respect
for your father,
a'ight, but I can't go hirin'
the whole damn neighborhood.
You can have
my job until
you get enough
for you an' Bug.
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, work for y'all, work for me, yo.
Po-po.
Step the fuck off.
Looking for your man Lex.
I see his broom,
but I don't see him.
Where's your
number two been at?
- I ain't seen him.
- Since when?
I thought we were
on better terms.
Or do you want me
rolling past
Iookin' for Lex
every 15 minutes?
He come past,
I'll call you.
I will!
If he come past.
Oh no, I don't know.
They're spinning
their wheels.
You know,
poor Tony Gray,
pulling 20%
of the black vote.
It's embarrassing.
Well, who knows
what the fuck
Carcetti's
trying to prove?
But I tell you,
at the end of this thing,
he's gonna regret getting
on the wrong side of me.
Mm-hmm.
A'ight, now.
I got what you need, boy,
clean tees,
any sizes, huh?
Lookin' for socks, briefs,
you lookin' for dice,
Zippos, cards--
come on over
to the Rollin' Emporium.
You ain't gotta
walk to Rite-Aid.
Shit, Rite-Aid
comin' to y'all.
What can I get you, baby?
Fresh dice
an' a pack of Trojans.
- All righty.
- You got Philly Blunts, too?
Bubbles got it all, dawg.
I'm the one-stop shop.
- How much is that?
- Six an' a bit.
Thank you.
Thank you kindly.
Yes, sir, I see
what you're lookin' at.
Two a deck,
name brand.
You can't beat that price.
Yeah, let me get
two decks, man,
and a white tee,
double-X.
And give me the rest
of them paint cans, too, man.
All right, all right,
there you go. That's it?
Yeah, what's that?
How much the man owe,
Sherrod?
- 13.
- Whoa whoa whoa.
He asked for all the cans.
Three cans is $12,
plus the other stuff.
It's $19.
$19, sir.
Come on, you still gettin'
off with a deal,
Now, you didn't have
to move your feet.
We came to you, right?
My bad.
$19, like he said.
Thank you very much.
He's an intern,
I'm working with him.
But, ma'am,
what I'm asking is
when was the last time
you saw Lex?
Oh, excuse me-- Curtis?
Hmm:
- Two days ago?
- I don't know where he at.
Three days?
You mind
if I look around?
I'd rather you
leave my house be.
Well, Ms. Anderson...
your son is in trouble,
and I can tell
you're upset.
But the best thing
that you can do for him--
the best thing that
he can do for himself--
is talk to me.
I'm gonna
tell you the truth:
We know
he's selling drugs.
And I'm gonna tell you...
I don't know
nothin' about that.
But I'm telling you
that I don't care
he's selling drugs.
I'm not even gonna
bother with that.
I'm here
because of a homicide,
and the way
it looks right now
your boy is running
from the police
behind that killing.
I don't know
where he at...
Ma'am...
Councilman,
my people got only
cost-of-living bumps
for four years.
Morale is at rock bottom.
All things being equal,
you'd be our guy.
We like what we hear.
The polls say
it's going to be Royce.
We endorse you now,
we're out in the cold.
Bobby... this might be
the chance to get in on
the ground floor
of something better.
That may be true, Major.
But for now,
we're gonna play the cards
that we were dealt.
Councilman,
if you were me, I'm sure--
I'd cover my ass
and endorse Royce,
along with the teachers
and the firefighters.
But I'd also
tell my membership
not to get carried away.
I mean,
it's one thing
for the police union
to call out for Royce,
it's another thing entirely
for off-duty cops
to be manning
the mayor's phone banks
and polling stations.
I don't think
any of my officers
will be too aggressive
for anybody.
That much I can give you.
Best you could do,
Tommy.
Royce has got all those
fucks runnin' scared.
Yeah...
best I could do.
Call it a night, Tommy.
You got a debate
to prepare for tomorrow.
Yeah. Debate.
Nothing matters more
at this point.
Let the truth
set you free, Norman.
Nothing matters at all.
Thanks.
Come on, boy,
come on now.
Man, you better not
be getting tired,
'cause you gonna
get put to the test
- on Saturday night.
- I'm ready.
- Hey, Miss Johnson.
- Hey, Justin. Hello, Dennis.
You're Spider's mother, right?
Right, Sharon.
Sharon Johnson.
Your boy left here
a while ago.
I ain't looking for him.
He at his grandmother's.
I wanted to ask you something.
You know, my son
is crazy about you.
All he talks about is boxing,
bein' at the gym,
and what his coach
been teachin' him.
Well, Spider's a good kid.
He really studies
the sport.
Dennis,
I am so grateful
for your interest in Spider,
I want to cook you dinner.
How 'bout tonight?
Well, ah, that is
really nice, Sharon.
But the thing is, I got four of my boys
fighting this weekend,
and I got to train 'em
really hard
these next few evenings.
You in here every night
of the week.
What you do for fun?
Look here,
you got to eat, right?
And you can look
at me and know
I throw down
in the kitchen--
among other places.
Yeah, I tell you what:
If you fix me up a plate
and bring it over here,
I would love that.
That I can do.
- He said what?
- "Me? I'm just the police."
Like butter wouldn't
melt in his mouth.
And the thing
that I resent most
is that he's not
just playing the system,
he's playing me.
Like I'm part
of the problem.
You were gonna
hold back the paper
for Davis
and Krawczyk, right?
Only until
the primary was over.
And now you feel
guilty about it.
Did he do that thing
where he, uh,
stares at you over the top
of his reading glasses?
You know,
that look that says,
"I'm the father
you never had,
and I don't want to be disappointed
in you ever again."
It's not funny, Cedric!
Those subpoenas
went out today!
The front office is
gonna go batshit!
But you did it anyway.
I'm sorry, but shit,
I'm just glad to see
Lester doing it
to somebody other than me.
Hey, you holdin'
us back, Sherrod.
I made a mistake, man.
Why you trippin'?
If I can cut you loose
to handle the money,
we can cover
twice the ground,
selling twice
the merchandise.
More-- more--
what you call it,
uh, market share.
Instead I gotta
keep your ass close.
You shoulda been promoted
to your own cart by now.
You keep on hittin' your dome
on the glass ceiling.
- Glass what?
- You gotta step up the math skills
if you wanna advance
in this here enterprise.
You remember
last spring when
you tried to take me
up to Harlem Park?
They couldn't even find
my records, Bubs.
They didn't want
shit to do with me.
They put you
in a classroom, right?
The teacher didn't
look at me once.
So you rolled out.
An' who got hurt
behind that, huh?
The teacher or you?
What's four times five
plus six times seven?
See? See?
Fuck that shit, son.
I can't wait until school starts.
- You joking, right?
- Nah, seriously, son.
I can't wait to see
all them girls,
see which ones got phat
over the summer,
- you know?
- Guess who I saw last week?
- Who?
- Kwaneese Davis.
Oh, shit, you mean
Cute-Ass Kwaneese?
- Uh-huh.
- She phat?
Got titties, too.
I'm definitely tappin' that pussy,
now, y'all watch.
I'm be all up
in Kwaneese this year
Iike this, bangin' that...
Just like you tried to do
last year, right?
Fuck you, nigga,
I only halfway tried.
So, Michael, who you
gettin' with this year?
Stankin' ass, uh-- what's her name?
What's her name?
- What's her name?
- Oh, Tina.
Tina-- Tina Jenkins.
Don't talk bad
about Tina, man.
I'm not sayin'
that it bad.
I'm sayin' she be
sucking dudes' dicks
in the boys'
bathroom and shit,
- that's all.
- I heard you, man.
She suck dick even better
than you do, Namond.
- Oh!
- Wow.
What up?
What up, see?
Good jabbin', man.
Chill chill chill!
Don't rip this shit.
I just bought
this throwback.
Yo, Michael, son,
if I ain't had this shit on,
I'd have fucked you up.
Word up.
You little niggas ain't up
to no good, is you?
Yo, what up, Monk?
Look here, first day
of school coming up, right?
- Yeah, next week.
- Y'all need school clothes and shit?
Here...
Yo, what's this for?
What, you ain't hear me?
For new clothes,
whatever else
you need to get.
- Thanks, man!
- Damn, 200?
- Yo, thanks, Monk.
- Oh, you need to thank my man Marlo.
He ain't wanna see you
little motherfuckers
going raggedy
on the first day.
Whoa. That Marlo?
- Naw, man, no thanks.
- You ain't gotta do nothing for it.
No thank you, man.
Hey, yo, Mr. Monk?
I'll take his
if he don't want it.
- I'll hold his for you--
- Yo, don't press, man.
Don't press.
Fuck is wrong
with you, boy?
You too good
for my money?
Or is you such
a bitch-ass punk
you worried about where
my money come from?
Yeah.
Ain't no thing, shorty.
We cool.
You can't tell nobody.
Swear to me you won't
spread this around.
And he saw you?
Yeah, he saw me.
Carv, I'm fucked in the ass
with a pineapple on this.
- What the helI'd you say to him?
- I said, "Mr. Mayor,
that's a good,
strong dick you got there,
and I see you know
how to use it."
I didn't say shit!
And I didn't wait for him
to say anything, either.
Shit, I'm never gonna
make rank now.
I'll end up riding the boat
or some shit like McNulty.
This is way beyond
my pay grade.
We need to get with someone
who knows politics.
Who do we know
like that?
On crime,
he knows you're coming,
so he's gonna
set some traps
and lean on stats
that say crime is down.
He'll also try
to inoculate himself
by making it about you.
Like you're playing
the race card
if you talk about drugs
or violent crime.
He's hoping
you'll back down.
But you come on
twice as hard:
"Clarence Royce has not
made this city safe."
Hey, Jen, what's up?
- You got a second?
- No, I got time, what is it?
- You forgot the check.
- Oh no, you're kidding me.
You've got to
pay it right away.
No, no, I got
the number here, yeah.
No, I'll straighten
it out straightaway.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Shit.
I forgot to mail the check
to the fuckin' archdiocese.
My kid's gonna get tossed
outta St. Albans
if I don't get
my shit together.
Tommy. Focus.
He comes at me with race
and some bullshit crime stats.
I ignore the race thing
and counter by noting
that homicides are up
15% even though
other violent crime stats
are down 12%.
I point out
this does not make sense
unless Royce is cooking
the crime stats,
making robberies, rapes,
and assaults disappear.
I suggest the mayor is not telling
the truth about crime in the city.
I conclude by declaring that
it is for all of Baltimore--
every neighborhood--
that I'm making public safety
the cornerstone
of my campaign.
Tomorrow night,
I will kick his ass.
But the next morning,
I still wake up white
in a city that ain't.
Sister Theresa?
Hey, how you doing?
Yeah, Tommy Carcetti.
Yo, Randy, man,
you crack me up, son.
Running behind him
talking about,
"I'll take his, Mr. Monk.
Give his to me."
Listen, man,
I could've used that extra.
I already spent
all the clothes money
Miss Anna gave me on stuff
to sell at school.
Yo, and plus Marlo
wanted us to have it.
He want to show us
who callin'
the shots out here.
- Yo, Michael, why you ain't take it?
- that ain't me, man.
- Say what?
- That owin' niggas for shit, man.
- That ain't me.
- I'll take any motherfuckin' money
- if he givin' it away now.
- Why?
Shit, your family got
more money than all of us.
Yeah, but my mom said
she cuttin' me off,
she ain't buyin' me school
clothes and shit.
You already took my job
with Bodie, so...
- Gentlemen.
- Oh my God.
Oh shit!
- Donut, you crazy, man.
- Yo, Donut.
You think you could steal us
one of them camper trucks?
Yo, you steal us a camper truck,
we can all go campin'
- out in the woods an' all.
- I be scared in the woods.
I don't mean far like that.
I mean like Howard County.
Naw naw naw, man.
The Ku Klux Klan
live in Howard County.
I know that for a fact.
Nigga, my aunt live
in Howard County.
There ain't no
Ku Klux Klan there.
Nigga, you simple,
I swear.
Hey, yo, Donut,
drive me away
from these
ignorant bitches, man.
You can't tell
these niggas nothin'.
Move, motherfucker.
Can you see
over the steering wheel?
You think
he'll talk to me?
Use my name
if you have to.
I had one of his sectors
for eight months.
What's wrong
with that picture?
Nigga, if there was a
black one in the parking lot,
I would've took one.
Yo-- narcos,
narcos!
760 to K-G-A.
I got a bailout
at Calhoun and Mosher,
six to eight juveniles
beating feet north
in the alleys
around Calhoun.
10-4. K-G-A to all units--
I love this.
Just like old times.
I don't need to chase
these fucking knuckleheads.
I know half of 'em.
Shit, I know
where they hang.
Besides,
you're a little overdressed.
Let's just call this in and go see
the man about your thing.
Yo, yo, man,
I ain't do nothin'!
- I ain't do nothin'!
- Then why you runnin'?
- 'Cause you chasin' me.
- Yeah, right. What's your name?
- For real, man, I ain't do nothin'.
- What's your goddamn name?
- Randy.
- Randy what?
- Wagstaff.
- I know you ain't lying.
Wouldn't nobody
make that shit up.
Put your hands against
this fucking wall.
Come on--
what do you know
about hoppers bailing
from a stolen car?
Nothin'.
Little motherfucker.
You slingin'.
- No, sir. I swear to God.
- Hell you ain't.
How else you walking around
with 200 in your pocket?
My foster mother gave me that
to buy school clothes with.
Your foster mother
gave you 200 cash?
Yeah.
Tell her to come down
to the Western,
and I'll give it back to her.
Beat feet, motherfucker,
before I lock your little ass up.
Don't be fucking
lookin' at me, move.
This right here is fire.
That said, I'm ready
to serve 'em myself
and keep your names off
the returns.
I've got my 20.
You two got to live
in this department.
Fuck 'em
where they live.
Let's go.
The price of steel
being what it is,
that's gonna kill us
if we can't
pass along the overage.
Mr. Krawczyk?
Baltimore City Police.
- What's this?
- A subpoena for records.
You need these right now,
because, uh,
I'm kinda up to my ass
in stuff today.
Honor it in a timely fashion.
I think that's
the legal standard.
- No problem, Detective--
- Shakima Greggs.
You're with the city?
- Which unit?
- Major Crimes.
Senator.
What the hell is this?
Subpoena for records.
Sphinx Club?
- Man of the year.
- What kinda bullshit is this?
You people must be out
your damn mind.
You were in
the Sphinx Club?
My uncle used
to tend bar over there.
Marvin Thompson?
Short guy--
What is your name,
Officer?
Detective Sydnor, sir.
"Major Crimes"?
Shit...
Enjoy your day, sir.
Son, we're gonna see
about this.
That's it.
Yankin' that bitch.
Son, that's too much knuckle.
Why the fuck
you keep callin' me?
But what I say, though?
He got
the message, fool.
Yo, Monk.
Who that, man?
Andre.
Old Face Andre.
Here, let me
holla at that dude.
Yo, check this out, man.
I'm gonna show you
how you do this
right here, man.
Don't rush me on shit.
I'll get at you
when I'm at you.
Yo, remember who
you're talking to
before you say
another fuckin' word.
Andre, man.
Nigga need
more maintenance
than both
my babies' mamas.
By accident.
It was accidental.
And the mayor
doesn't say anything?
I think
he's pretty mad.
I mean, Major,
I only took this detail
to try and make sergeant
on this list.
Kid, you made
sergeant already.
Shit, if Royce
gets reelected,
you'll be a lieutenant in two years
and a major in four.
You go back down
to the hall.
You act like
it never happened.
You shut up.
Say nothing to no one.
But the mayor,
he's gonna--
He's gonna watch
and see how you carry it.
And kid,
you're a fucking rock.
When the mayor
looks in your face,
he knows he can
trust you with this.
And I'll bet
in a couple of weeks,
he comes asking,
real friendly-like,
what are you looking
to do with the department?
With your career?
He's interested in you.
But he doesn't mention
no blowjob,
and neither do you.
Uh-uh, it just lays there
Iike a bad pierogi
on the plate,
both of you pretending
it ain't there.
What if he
screws me over?
Bounces me
to a midnight shift?
He does that,
you will talk.
What I wouldn't give to be
in your shoes right now.
Kid, careers have
been launched
on a hell
of a lot less.
Just shut up
and play dumb.
I can do that.
No problem.
Thanks, Major.
Thanks for taking the time
to meet me on this.
I mean, it's a weight off
my mind talking to you.
It really is.
Don't mention it.
Maybe you get a chance
to do me a turn
one day after
you make rank, huh?
Oh, boy.
It's all good, Carv.
Because if some
federal motherfucker comes
through the door,
I say, "Hey,
it's all in the game."
But a City Police?
Baltimore City?
Hell, no.
Can't be happenin',
'cause I know
I have raised too much
goddamn money
for the mayor
and his ticket.
Hell, no!
Ain't no soul
in the world
that fuckin' ungrateful!
- Calm down, Clay, hmm?
- Money laundering?
They gonna
come talk to me
about money laundering?
In West Baltimore:
Shit... Where do y'all
think I'm gonna
raise cash for
the whole damn ticket?
From laundromats
and shit?
From some tiny-ass
Korean groceries?
You think I have time
to ask a man
why he givin' me money?
Or where he gets
his money from?
I'll take any motherfucker's money
if he givin' it away.
- I don't wanna know.
- I know you don't wanna know.
But I'm scratchin'
an' clawin'
to get it done for you,
Clarence.
For you and me
and the rest of the team.
And who comes
through my door
but a Baltimore City Police
Iookin' to get up
into my shit about it.
Clay, we didn't know
about that.
I'm sorry, I gots
to leave up out of here
before I lose
my damn mind.
Nobody knew about that.
You want
to run a campaign
with my money
pillowed under your ass,
you need your people
to back the fuck up, Clarence.
Krawczyk's on line one.
I'll jump on Burrell
and Demper both.
Find out
what the hell's going on.
Wait-- wait a minute.
That new driver,
the bald-headed, white kid.
Where did he
come here from?
Hoskins brought
him in, I think.
Hoskins:
He doesn't have a better rabbi
in the department than that:
Why, you want
to lose him?
Let me think about it.
Yeah, man, Officer Walker
be shady like that.
Police be stealin', yo.
Yo, what I really wanna
get is a bubble Caprice.
I seen
a nice one, too.
'94 caprice on 22's.
Shit was tight.
You better be careful.
They almost caught you today.
Nigga, they ain't
almost caught shit.
Shh. Be quiet, y'all.
Y'all know
who I am, right?
Carver.
You a narcos.
Today I'm auto theft.
Fair warning.
If I see any of
y'all little hoppers
even smile
at a motor vehicle again,
it ain't gonna be no juvenile hearing.
No, it's gonna be my people
settlin' up with y'all in the alleys.
You understand?
- You can't do that, yo.
- Try me, Namond.
Yeah, that's right.
I know your name,
I know where you live
and I know where
y'all hang.
Damn, yo!
Nice ride.
- Hey, Bunk.
- Hmm?
You have any luck
finding your shooter?
Naw. He's runnin'.
But at least I know who
my shooter is, right?
I just got
to find the boy.
- Family won't go for nothin'?
- Nah.
Mother wouldn't say shit.
But it wasn't the usual way
a mama lies.
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.
It was a weird vibe, man.
I can't explain it.
It was like she was off
somewhere else in her head.
Line four.
Communication.
- Who's up?
- I'm up. I'll take it.
No, wait.
If it's yours,
you lucky bitch,
then it's a domestic
in a house with four wits.
- You want the call?
- But I pick up that phone,
do I make it unlucky?
Or is it still your call?
You want the call,
pick it up.
If you don't, don't.
Homicide. Norris.
Right. Uh-huh. I got it.
1400 Lanvale, in the street,
found by the post officer,
no suspects,
no witnesses.
Ah, man.
Better to be lucky
than to be good.
You wanna work
the heavy bag?
G'head. Four rounds.
Hey.
- Hey.
- I'm Gail.
I made this for you
and the other men
to let you know
you're appreciated.
- That's real nice.
- Peach cobbler.
I'm sorry, I forgot
whose mother you are.
Oh, I don't have
any boys.
I just appreciate
what you been doing,
you and the other coaches
volunteering and all.
Well, thank you,
that's real nice.
I got three girls. Y'all don't
teach girls, though, do you?
- No, I'm real old-fashioned about that.
- Oh, I agree wit' you.
Men should be men
and women should be women.
That's what I think.
Single wound,
upper back, no casings,
no witnesses, and nothing
on the canvas.
- Dead when you got here?
- Actually not.
He was still conscious
and coughin' blood when I pulled up.
- You ask who shot him?
- Yeah, I asked who shot him.
He said it was
a guy with a gun.
Yo, why the fuck
you keep calling me?
He got the message, fool.
Yo, Monk,
who that, man?
Andre.
Old Face Andre.
Yo, Monk,
who that, man?
Andre.
Old Face Andre.
Lemme key that.
Yo, Monk.
Who that, man?
Andre.
Old Face Andre.
Yo, check this out, man.
Don't rush me on shit.
- I'll get at you when I'm at you.
- I'm just saying...
Old Face Andre.
Tryin' to reup
with Monk Metcalf.
Yeah, well, Monk took the call
on his cell phone.
But that second voice
ranked him.
Ranked everybody,
by the sound of it.
Marlo Stanfield.
On the phone.
The way he shut that call down,
I'd say, yeah, that was him.
Yeah, but what was all that
in the background? Fireworks, or--
Naw, it was regular intervals.
Semi-auto from the sound.
Target practice, maybe.
Either that
or a firing squad.
There are no bodies
on this guy in months,
but we get him
on the phone
and it sounds
like a war zone.
Well, at least he gets
on a phone now and then.
- That's something.
- Sounds arrogant, doesn't he?
Like he's the lil' king
of everything.
Ah. Youth.
Yo, bubs.
Thought you asleep.
If you want...
I could go
to school some.
I ain't been
for a while,
so I don't even
know if I can.
But if you
want me to go...
ain't no thing.
His Honor was mad:
I can't begin
to describe it.
- What's he want from us?
- To block the subpoenas,
but he knows we can't
once those things go out.
What I could promise him
is no more surprises
out of our shop.
Is this that
cocksucker McNulty?
Not this time. He's been gone
from that unit a year.
My best guess would be
Lester Freamon.
- Freamon?
- Lester's got a helluva game.
Well, we need to sit
on the motherfucker.
All that unit needs,
Commissioner,
is proper supervision.
Hey, the State of Maryland
just lost another
cooperating witness,
and I just found a lot
of fucking overtime.
This case went from
a who-gives-a-fuck drug murder
to straight-up red ball.
Fuck, I should've
picked up that phone.
Hey, Sarge.
My boy's a witness.
Drug case pending
in part 18.
You know for sure
he's killed for that reason?
Don't know shit. But from the look
of the court computer,
this guy's
the state's whole case.
Don't put it in the 24 that
the guy was a witness.
Trust me,
we do not wanna kick shit
in an election year.
Work the case, take the O.T.,
but bury the witness angle
till we know for sure.
And close the door.
Yeah.
It's Landsman. Homicide.
Is the major
in this morning?
Next order of business:
class rules.
It helps if the team
is constant on these.
Less wiggle room
for the children.
Mrs. Scott:
Same as last year,
double space.
Language Arts,
we grade a lot of papers.
It doesn't make them
write any better,
but it saves my eyesight.
Make sure you
demonstrate it for them.
Some of them think double-space
means more space between words.
I'd of thought
by eighth grade--
Rule of thumb around here,
Mr. Pryzbylewski: Never assume.
Explain what
you want them to do,
have them do it,
then explain again.
With time and patience,
they'll get it.
- Mrs. Shapiro:
- It's easier to keep track of lab work
if we all use
the same heading.
Upper right-hand corner,
above the first blue line:
name, date, and class number,
in that order?
Mr. Pryzbylewski, do you have
anything you want addressed?
Can we have them
not chew gum?
They won't do it
in Ms. Sampson's class,
but in four years, I have not
been able to stop them.
You can try, but first year,
it's best to stick with basics.
And team rules--
we can only go
with what
we can all enforce.
Also, keep your
windows closed.
Makes them drowsy,
and drowsy's good.
There's a lot to learn.
But for now,
build in lots of activities
in your lesson plan.
You can't have enough.
You keep them busy,
you keep them off-guard.
You need soft eyes.
Excuse me:
Yeah, but that
doesn't prevent you
from giving more
under your wife's name,
your children, if they
got separate accounts...
yeah.
Sorry, Richie,
can you hold a moment?
Your buddy
from the F.O.P.
And he says
it's important.
Hey, Stan.
I'm a little busy
losing an election here.
You remember about
six months ago,
you told me
to keep an eye for
any witnesses
gettin' clipped?
You remember that?
Who's better than me,
Tommy?
Hey, Richie,
can I call you back?
Thanks.
Anything else you want me
to do, Miss Donnelly?
Uh...
you live near
Duquan Weems, correct?
Dukie:
I want you to take
this to his house.
These clothes won't
stay clean long.
Make sure you deliver
them just to Duquan,
not any of the adults
in the house.
- Just Duquan.
- Want me to do it tonight?
that would be great.
And, Crystal, thanks for today.
You're welcome,
Miss Donnelly.
- Can I help you?
- Yes, ma'am.
This young man has to be
registered for school.
- Does he attend here:
- He should.
What I mean is, what grade
were you in last year, dear?
He kinda lost his way
some time ago.
He's livin'
with me now.
And you are his...
Uncle.
I'm his uncle.
Come into my office.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Yo, look at coach
workin' it, yo.
A'ight, man, break.
That's what I like to see, baby.
That's what I like to see.
You gotta use that left
- a little more, though, a'ight?
- Yo, man, you finished?
- Got another two minutes.
- Fuck that, I got a fight coming up.
You can come back
later, a'ight?
Yo, man said he got
one more round, a'ight?
Step aside, youngin'.
Naw, man, bag is mine
for four rounds
- and I only did three.
- Fuck that.
What the fuck you
tryin' to prove, huh?
Whoa, whoa. Come on, man,
come on. Come on.
- What's going on, boy?
- I got a fight Saturday night,
an' the boy won't
get off the bag.
What the fuck he on
the bag for anyway, huh?
He don't even fight.
He don't even spar.
Spar with
your ass any day.
- Come on, then.
- Hey hey hey.
Y'all be cool,
you hear me?
I ain't putting up
with this foolishness.
Come here, Michael.
- I can work the bag now, right?
- Not yet. Just wait.
- You said four rounds.
- Yeah, I know what I said.
You finish up your rounds,
and then Justin gets on.
I don't want hear
no more street talk.
We boxin' up in here,
we ain't fightin'.
He wanna get in
the ring with me,
- we can go.
- Look here, look here,
Iet me tell you something:
You can come here,
work out,
use the equipment.
But nobody
gets in that ring
unless they're being trained.
You wanna be trained?
I've been watching you
hit that bag.
You got
a natural right hand,
the way you throw it,
the way you land it.
Now if I was
to train you,
we'd have to start
with floor work.
'Cause see, if you don't
know how to move,
you ain't got no business
being in that ring.
So what you think?
I'd train you myself,
personally.
Nah, really I just wanna keep
doing what I been doing.
All right.
Let's see that right.
Uh-huh.
Is Dukie here:
What's that?
That's for Duquan, right?
I take it to him.
Gimme.
Hey, Crystal.
Miss Donnelly said
to give you these.
Okay.
I'll be right down.
What?
And for either of
my opponents to suggest
that downtown development
comes at the expense
of our city's neighborhoods,
well, that's just unfair
and, uh, divisive.
For them to suggest
that my administration
has not been
responsive, well...
Economic development
cannot be a band-aid.
It is a long-term process
that requires commitment
to retraining our workforce
and, as I said before,
this can only be successful
in a city where
people feel safe.
So before we can
even begin to think about
Iuring new industries to Baltimore,
we need to think about
how we can make
these neighborhoods
and this city safe once again.
Mr. Carcetti may think
it's in his interest
to exploit people's fears.
He's been doing it
throughout this campaign.
I'm offended by it,
personally.
But the fact is,
that violent crime
is down citywide,
and our police department
is working hard
to keep it that way--
and will continue to do so
under my administration.
Councilman Carcetti,
you have two minutes
to respond.
Does anyone in this room
really believe
that crime is down
in Baltimore?
You calling me a liar,
Tommy?
Gentleman, please.
No personal interactions.
- Councilman Carcetti.
- Can the mayor honestly tell
the people of Rosemont,
of Belair Edison,
of Highlandtown
or Cherry Hill
there's less drug-dealing,
less violence?
Any statistics coming
from the police department
cannot be trusted,
because under this mayor,
the police are more concerned
with protecting Clarence Royce
politically than fighting crime.
There's no leadership
and morale has never been lower.
I'll change that.
It's business as usual
down at City Hall
and as a result,
our response to crime
has been characterized
time and time again
by wanton indifference.
...32 yards!
What do I mean
by business as usual?
What do I mean
by wanton indifference?
Well, last night
in West Baltimore,
on Lanvale Street,
another citizen
was shot and killed.
This time, the victim
was a key witness
in a drug case that
had yet to come to court.
Courageously, this man
had agreed to testify
in two weeks time
in that case.
The police should have
been protecting him.
They were not,
and he was murdered.
- Oh, shit.
- Why? Because this mayor...
You're prime-time, Eddie.
...would not spend the money
to protect him.
Now I have no doubt
that in a moment or two
Clarence Royce will
accuse me of exploiting
this man's death
for my own political purpose.
But the truth is,
a year ago I wrote
the mayor a letter.
I have copies for anyone
who wants one.
I begged him
to spend the money
and make witness protection
a priority.
He ignored me.
I even teamed up
with our legislative leaders--
Delegate Watkins
and others--
to get matching funds
for witness protection
approved in Annapolis.
And incredibly
those matching funds
were never claimed
by this administration.
Now to mention this
now may be exploitive--
I don't know.
I only know it's true,
and on such truths
I ask the voters
of our city
to consider a change.
Folks, please, please,
hold your applause
until after the round
of questions is over.
Mayor Royce?
No more surprises, huh:
I am unaware of the specifics
of the incident
to which Councilman Carcetti
is referring,
uh, so I can't answer
that directly, um...
however, I can say
that this city places
the highest priority
on protecting those citizens
who come forward to testify,
and we will continue
to do so.
Mr. Carcetti states
that he wrote a letter
expressing his concerns,
and I'm sure that he did.
I mean it's-- it's--
it's easy enough
to write letters
when all you have to do
is write letters.
But when you
are required
to run a city
on limited resources,
and balance priorities,
well, then-- well,
then you understand
that writing letters will
not solve the problem.
Oh, no...
Shit, girl.
You know
I'm-a roll wit' you.
Huh, I need
some kinda break.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, shit.
Ain't nothin' worse
than them bitches
with fucked-up nails
at the blackjack table.
You know.
Hold on.
You think my son
gonna go up
to that school lookin'
like himself?
And I don't believe
we can get a handle on crime
until we get a handle
on the schools.
Because we need to be
thinking about these kids
before the corners
take them.
And this means a renewed focus
on our schools...
Yo, Renaldo!
- Renaldo!
- Que?
Next time you finish up the box,
you need to holler on it, yo.
Sí sí.
Hey, y'all, it's Omar.
- Omar.
- There he is.
- Omar step, yo.
- Omar, yo.
Y'all ain't got
no Honey Nut?
Whatever you see.
And a carton of Newports.
Omar comin'.
Hey, y'all,
here he come.
Omar. Omar.
Omar strollin'.
They don't have
the Honey Nut?
- I don't even want this, dawg.
- Why not?
It ain't what you're taking,
it's who you taking it from,
you feel me?
How you expect to run
with the wolves come night
when you spend all day
sporting with the puppies?
- So you staying with Royce, I see?
- What you mean?
Oh, man.
Makes sense since I know
you got your fill of Carcetti.
They've been puttin' up
a crop of these things
on every lawn
on the block.
And as fast as I take 'em down,
they bring more.
That's what they do
this time of year.
I see you're
at your leisure.
I work two nights a week,
three day shifts
and no weekends.
I'm off till this afternoon.
You're good with it?
It ain't the Hopkins gig,
but it'll do.
Pullin' 52, good bennies,
got a take-home car.
I mean the hotel manager's
a pain in the ass, but still.
Well, if you was a bit free,
I heard something.
This thing over at University of
Maryland School of Social Work--
- they got a grant. Big money.
- Just stop.
Half a million to look at
repeat violent offenders,
clinical intervention--
all that mess.
So they gonna study
some shit, huh?
Melvin, I had me a good helping
of them downtown, tie-wearing,
come-to-do-good, stay-to-do-well
college types last year.
You sure? 'Cause I sold 'em on it,
should you want it.
Bunny, you're a big man
down on the campus.
You the police
that legalized it.
The college boys
loved that mess.
Nobody else did, though.
Well, I tried.
You did.
Yo, blacktops, pandemic.
Pandemic,
got that pandemic.
Pandemic.
My mac, pandemic,
blacktops right here.
That's my boy, right?
Ain't taking no handouts,
but he workin' for it.
See what I mean?
This nigga's made
a little something out of this corner.
Now hold on, son.
We're just talking now.
- All right?
- Man, y'all did good with this spot.
You a rightful hustler.
What's your name again, man?
Boney? Biddy?
- What's it now?
- You know my name.
Yeah, but now
here's the thing:
With this spot
all built up and shit,
- we need it, yo.
- Yeah.
- What?
- Two choices:
You can start taking our packages
or you can step off.
My man Chris is
gonna holla at you, all right?
You tell him
what it need to be.
Don't wait for the pandemic.
It's right here, y'all.
Don't sleep
on the pandemic.
I want to know more
about that boy right there.
Got good signs on him.
Big paws on a puppy, huh?
Yeah, big paws
on a puppy.
To a "T."
Get that blacktop
before you flop.
Get that pandemic.
The truth is we don't know
why he was killed.
It could have had something to do
with him being a witness
or it could be unrelated.
Now, whoever leaked that shit
to Carcetti's camp,
- they lied on us.
- Yeah, well, that's it.
Eight points--
close as Carcetti gets.
He wants to go
big dick with me?
I'll show him
what he can't handle.
We put it out there:
Anyone contributing
to both sides
gets frozen out
of my next term.
- No one rides the middle anymore.
- Done.
Next, I want DPW and HCD
out there today
tearing down
all Carcetti's signs.
Any lamppost, median,
any city-owned buildings,
unless the homeowner's
out there arguing,
- tear it down.
- Done.
Third, I want transpo
camped outside of
Carcetti's headquarters.
Any car, any violation,
the meter flag goes up,
- inspection sticker-- tow it.
- Done.
Next, you two,
slow it down.
Nothing else comes out
about that murder
until after the primary.
And I want both of you
to go to the press
and talk down that witness angle.
Take the full weight
either way it goes.
Clarence, I'm running dead even
with Bond right now.
How are you gonna be running
if I drop you from the ticket?
Okay, that's it.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Go to it. Now.
- Mr. Mayor.
- Mm-hmm.
- What?
- Carcetti has a point.
I went down to Annapolis,
got matching funds
for witness protection.
You didn't earmark a dime
to put 'em into play.
- Next fiscal year.
- Don't claim poverty on this.
We're only talking
a quarter of a million.
I match those funds now
and that motherfucker Carcetti,
he's got a campaign highlight:
"Tommy Carcetti expands
witness protection program.
Fought for
and won extra funds."
Hell with that!
I go after that state-match funds
after the election.
Naw naw,
I paid for three pills.
Look, blue shirt
gets two.
- Naw, I get two.
- White shirt gets one.
- Cheatin' motherfucker.
- I get four.
Look, blue shirt gets two,
white one, no shirt one.
Now y'all can take what
y'all paid for and walk away
or just walk away with nothing.
Motherfuck a refund.
No, nigga,
I paid for three.
You need to rethink what putting
a hand on me's gonna get you.
You can thank your friend here
for snatching away y'all highs.
Yo yo, hold up, hold up.
Can I get my two?
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.
You don't rattle. Yo, you come up
under my wing, young'un,
you ain't gonna do nothin'
but rise, man.
I don't even know why
you thinkin' about quittin'.
Look, man,
like I already told you--
I'm all the way repaid,
and tomorrow's school.
Come on, man, what the fuck
do you want to go to school for?
What do you want to be?
An astronaut?
A dentist?
A pay lawyer, nigga?
Look, check it out:
Why don't you just come
down here after school
and just work
these rush hours for me.
How about that:
Hey. Hey.
That's great. Thank you.
I know that kind of money--
I said I know that kind of money
doesn't come easy to anyone.
No, it's just something
on my end here--
some construction
or something-- right.
Yeah, right.
Thanks again.
Two hours, 30 grand.
Am I getting the hang
of this or what?
What the fuck is that?
DPW's tearing up
the sidewalk
right outside our door.
You really pissed him off.
Yes, I did, didn't l?
Come on.
Door-to-door in lrvington.
- Right.
- And we got that dead witness tonight.
Yeah. Federal?
Naw, she ain't no federal.
That there a city girl.
I like shorty too.
She's all right...
as long as she don't
get in my way.
Re-up right there.
Por qué:
School ain't starting
till tomorrow, right?
The little one'll be all dressed up
with nowhere to go.
Yeah, you know it too,
don't you, girl?
The camera-- if you go
in front, they're gonna--
They're supposed
to know it's me, man.
I'm my own trademark.
You feel me?
Sí, but if they know
it's you, then--
What, you scared
on bein' made, huh?
Claro que sí.
How 'bout I put you
in one of them full-body bunny suits?
You'd be like a six-foot rabbit
putting a pistol in their face.
Let me get a pack
of Juicy Fruit.
You look like one of them
half-soul, half-Chinese types
from Vietnam and shit.
Come again now,
Mama-san.
Patience, girl.
More patience.
The guy drives a shit box.
He's got a two-bit minimart,
but the back door in there
is reinforced steel,
and the security camera
on the street is high-end.
Not only that, but I think
I made the re-up today:
Schoolgirl with
a heavy backpack.
Hmm. Well, I pulled
Andre's phone history
trying to find
Marlo's organization,
cross-referencing DNRs
to other cells.
This is Fruit.
This is Monk,
and there's three or four
other good probables.
Not likely to find a direct line
to Marlo that way.
Andre had to go through Monk
to get to him.
No, but we might get
a cell on Chris Partlow,
or for tote or for one,
of the top lieutenants.
- We're gettin' close.
- Uh-huh.
Deputy pulled me downtown.
You guys aren't into any shit,
- are you?
- No, sir.
Good he wasn't down
at the ocean today.
And the subpoenas?
You won't see
a page of anything
until after the primary.
After that,
if a document lands
and there's no one
there to read it,
will the mayor and his people
honestly give a shit?
Other than that,
what can I tell you
except to get that unit
back on the street where it belongs?
Lieutenant, you are relieved
from command of Major Crimes.
You've done exceptional work,
and in light of that,
we want you to improve
the performance
of another vital aspect
of our mission--
- Sir?
- Telephone Reporting Unit.
You report there
tomorrow, 0800.
Have I done
something wrong?
Lieutenant Marimow will be
taking over Major Crimes.
If you need to brief him,
do so promptly.
Yes, sir.
Jimmy, how's that
beach house coming?
Beach...
um, fine, sir--
Great. Sounds great.
Yeah, hand me
the colander, will you?
He's early.
You get the door.
I'll do that.
- Hey!
- Hey!
Come in.
- Ooh, smells good.
- Spaghetti-- nothing fancy.
"Côtes du Rhône"?
Yeah, the sommelier
behind the plexi said it was dry.
- Hey, Beadie!
- Hey, Bunk, how you doing?
Whoa, look at you!
Blonde and all.
- You like it?
- I do, I do.
Hey, kids.
This is Jack, that's Cary.
This is Detective Moreland.
- Hi.
- Hi!
- Call me Bunk.
- Let me open this wine.
Yeah, that's right.
Let that shit breathe.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- That's all right. They hear worse.
- Yeah, no doubt.
So, you want ice
in yours?
No, man, that's
a double-digit vino.
- Even has a cork.
- Swell.
- I like your binders.
- Thanks!
McNulty gave them to us.
- McNulty?
- Yeah.
- Not Jimmy?
- No.
Uncle Jimmy? Jim?
- No.
- No:
Daddy? Pops?
McNulty.
Oh, just plain McNulty.
And if I take
his weak-ass product,
that means I'll be makin' less money,
you know what I'm sayin'?
Only reason I could bring
any life to this strip
is because of the good shit
that y'all was givin' me.
then I'm standing here like
a asshole holding my Charles Dickens
'cause I ain't got
no muscle, no backup.
Shit, man. Yo, if this
was the old days?
Yeah, now, well,
the thing about the old days,
they the old days.
People I'm working with now...
So you want to bump with Marlo
over real estate?
You're on your own.
But if you want my advice--
I don't, man.
I don't.
Bodie. Yo, Bodie.
Me:
I lost the wholesale
to every crew
in Winchester homes.
Them horses takin'
Marlo's shit now.
He pushin' the independents
over hilltop, too.
I lost three crews
there this month.
What about the East Side?
There we got
a much bigger problem:
all those ugly-ass bitches
in Yankee hats
chasin' all
the locals away.
I heard them New York boys
ran off most of Delroy's people,
and those that stay
gotta take they package.
Man, all this theorizing
about how it be product,
not territory?
You can't talk that shit
if a nigga snatchin'
all of the territory
an' won't take
none of your product.
See, the thing is Marlo's
only takin' a little bite.
Them New York cats is like
Wal-Mart comin' to town.
Me, personally, I think
it's time Wal-Mart went home.
If we gonna bump with 'em,
it's got to be all of us.
I tell you what: I'd like to see
Marlo with us in on that one.
You know what I mean?
One big Baltimore team.
Yeah, Marlo can make an inconvenient
nigga disappear, can't he?
I heard he got
some kinda hookup
at this funeral home
in Westport.
Coffin goes in there
needs two pallbearers.
Come out, you need eight
to carry that bitch,
you know what I mean?
Nah nah. He usin'
them shut-up rowhouses.
Dump a body in there, no one
can tell one smell from another.
Well, whatever he doin',
he cold, but he ain't stupid.
Think it's time to try again
to talk to the boy.
I hope you got better shit
to say than Stringer
'cause young'un ain't given
no one an ear yet.
Dang, Jimmy, you're
a domesticated motherfucker.
Yeah, I guess I am.
Yeah, we're good.
How's everything
at the port?
- Quiet.
- It's quiet everywhere.
- Even the Western.
- Yeah.
I'm having a hard time
with it, though.
Somethin' ain't right.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.
- You working something?
- Yeah, I got this one case.
I know who the shooter is
but can't find him.
He'll turn up.
- Maybe.
- More?
Oh, mercy.
No, ma'am.
Dessert:
I was thinking we might
go out for a little taste.
Unless you got to
tuck in the kids.
- I don't know.
- Oh, it's fine, Jimmy. You go.
I'll tuck 'em in.
She trusts you.
Yeah.
Can't go to dinner without
catching a page, huh? What now?
Her john jumps in the shower.
She rummages his wallet.
He figures it out
and beats on her
till the people next door
call the front desk.
Sir, if she doesn't have
the money on her,
I don't know
what I can do.
Did you beat
that woman in there?
I just want
my money back.
Excuse me, Mr. Gergen.
I need a moment
with my director of security.
If she presses charges,
I'm cuffin' that motherfucker.
Mr. Colvin, this is
a delicate matter.
"Delicate"? Shit.
Mr. Gergen represents
a national consortium
of convention planners,
and he's been a friend of the hotel--
Mr. Colvin:
Mr. Colvin:
Now, you took his cash
and he beat you good, huh?
How much
he beat you for?
How much:
Give me the cuffs.
No, Mr. Colvin. I...
What the fuck is this?
She steals my money,
and you're gonna lock me up?
You're gettin' charged
with assault.
You wanna charge her
with the theft,
I'll put the cuffs
on her, too.
But you in a wagon,
shitbird.
Mr. Colvin,
this is not acceptable.
No. He's goin'
in a wagon.
Mr. Colvin,
I have to insist.
30 years
a police officer,
I never took cuffs
off a right charge.
Ain't about to start now.
You're not a police officer,
Mr. Colvin.
You work for us.
Naw, I'm good.
You nursin' that thing
like a baby bird.
You know those little corner joints
in the ghetto
that sell subs,
and fried chicken, lake trout?
Lake trout:
Like egg creams
in New York.
No eggs, no cream.
Exactly.
No lake, no trout.
They're pogies.
Whitefish, trash fish.
Exactly.
White trash fish.
I mean, "lake trout."
That's all marketing.
It's just all dressed up
like something it ain't.
You know
what I'm sayin'?
Sometimes it is what it is.
It really is.
That's deep.
I like the way
you think.
Yeah, you too.
Hold on.
Dang, Bug, if you can tie one shoe,
you can tie the other one.
You hear me?
Cookies all on your face.
Come on.
What up, shorty?
Ready for the first day?
Yeah, he can't wait
to be in the third grade.
Ain't that right, Bug?
'Sup?
Dukie.
Cool.
Look at all these big-ass
eighth graders out here.
Look like some sixth-graders
gonna get banked.
Yo, come in here.
I wanna show y'all somethin'.
Go ahead, Bug.
Yo, what up, boy?
That jersey's crazy, son.
Where you get that at?
Yo, check it.
This dude in the joint
with my father drew these.
I'm about
to get one on my arm.
Is this you? Why would you
get yourself on your arm?
In case you forget
what you look like?
Yo, what do
these mean, man?
A'ight,
this one means "heart"--
Iike, you know,
"He got heart"--
and that means "lion."
How you know that?
Word, the dude
could be playing you.
Like, this one,
instead of "heart,"
it could mean like
"bitch" or something.
And like this one, it could mean
like "pussy" or "clown."
Come on, man.
Fuck y'all motherfuckers.
- They probably do, too.
- Man, get outta my house.
Understand something
about me:
I may be wearing
these bars,
but I worked the bricks
to earn 'em,
and I am stone-cold police
first, last, and always.
Froze my balls off
in the winter,
sweated 'em in the summer,
ran, jumped,
rolled in the dirt with
the bad guys 24/7/365.
Now, I'm a great admirer
of this unit.
Avon Barksdale? That was
a 14-point buck you bagged.
However, we are
gonna do better.
And if there's a case
to be made out there,
we'll make it together
with good work
and good supervision of that work.
I want to be briefed
every step of the way.
Questions?
No:
Good.
Yo, who you got?
I got... "Prez"--
"Prez"-- what?
I got Mrs. Scott. Fuckin' hate
that foul bitch, man.
Man, she ain't that bad.
At least you ain't got Sampson.
Yeah, I know.
Yo, Michael,
who you got?
"Presborowski"?
"Prez"--
Yo, he new and white.
We got it made.
Uh-oh, look at this.
Where is your fine
take-home car?
Got took home.
We need to talk.
Sixth grade is
on the first floor!
Seventh grade is
on the second.
Eighth-grade homeroom
is on the third floor!
Don't go up
the down staircase.
Quickly and quietly,
people.
I see you, Quantell.
I see you too.
School's getting ready
to start. Come on.
Hi, dear.
Good to see you back.
Yo, what up, Turner.
You back for more?
Aw, damn, man.
I love the first day, son.
Everybody all friendly
an' shit.
Namond Brice.
Already, we're starting?
Damn, man.
Next time, they stay
in my drawer.
Yo, whatever, man.
I know, right?
Already, son.
I know, right?
We're seventh graders.
Yo, dang.
You see Neesy?
Yo, them bitches
is on steroids, word.
Word, son.
Send them bitches to lran.
That shit'd be over
in a heartbeat.
Okay, check the chart
to see where you're sitting.
Check the chart.
Hi, I'm Randy.
How are you doing,
Randy?
Check the chart.
Okay. Good morning.
Okay, good morning.
Yo! Shut up!
Good morning.
I'm your homeroom teacher,
obviously.
My name is
Mr. Pryzbylewski.
But you can call me
Mr. Pryzbylewski.
Okay. Let's find out
who you are.
This is Mrs. Donnelly.
Teachers, we had trouble
with first bells,
so expect the class change
to ring in one minute.
Students will walk, not run,
to classes in an orderly manner.
Okay, um, we'll, uh,
get to know each other
a little later.
Sorry. Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Latifah.
Uh, sorry.
Where my bus passes at?
Crystal Judkins,
you're not listed.
Crystal? I look
like Crystal to you?
I'm Charlene.
Ronald Parker:
Ha. Karim Williams.
Ronald over there.
Aw Jeez.
Yo, Mr. Prez, I need a hall pass
for the bathroom.
It's an emergency.
Everyone, I need
those bus passes back.
Hold on. Whoa.
Everyone, stay where you are.
Stay where--
I need those passes back.
It's an emergency.
Mr. Prez...
Everyone, I need
those bus passes back.
The kids that need them...
- Mr. Prez...
- What?
Just take one.
I need those
bus passes back!
No one leaves this room
until Mr. Pryzbylewski
gets those bus passes back.
Do I need
to say that twice?
Thank you.
Thank you.
You'll get the hang of it.
Come in.
Are you coming in
or what?
I'm coming in, okay?
You asked
to see me, sir?
I did.
Seeing as how I like to know
my boys in depth:
why'd you want this unit?
Honestly?
I took the sergeant's test,
scored pretty high,
but not high enough.
And Lieutenant Hoskins,
we went through
the academy together.
He said that this--
this is a good detail
for going up the ladder.
I mean I know
you have to do it for a while,
but maybe next year,
if I do good here,
they'll reach down for me.
Next year, huh?
I mean, for some things,
that's a long time to wait.
Excuse me:
I hear you're a good cop.
I also hear you recognize
who your friends are
and that
you're loyal to them.
Did I hear
all that right?
Absolutely.
Where are you
on the list?
32. They took 15, but--
Thirt-- man, I thought you were
gonna say something like 60,
or, you know, 95.
Hey, let me call
my man Burrell.
No need in wasting
good police like you
chauffeuring
around politicians.
I don't even know
what to say, Mr. Mayor.
This-- this is unexpected.
Don't mention it.
Today being the first day,
let's have some fun.
I'm gonna throw you
a little math puzzle,
see if I can get you
thinking on your feet.
Andre is leaving Baltimore...
Uh, Mr. Prezbo,
I need to change my seat
'cause this boy here
smells like a garbage can.
All right, you need to work a little
on your compassion skills.
Yeah, he needs
to work a little
on his soap
and water skills.
All right,
like I was saying,
uh, my friend Andre
is leaving Baltimore.
He's going
60 miles an hour--
Hey, what side of Baltimore,
east or west?
It doesn't make
any difference.
That's what you think.
Okay, east.
West, west, okay?
Okay.
Uh, and he's going, uh,
to Philadelphia...
Man, Philly's ass.
Yo, you think
Allen lverson is ass?
- Okay, stop.
- He only play for them.
He ain't from there.
Hey, I never play
for the Sixers
no matter how much
they pay me.
Nigga, they'd pay yo' ass
to go away. Ha ha.
Enough!
Okay, Andre's leaving Baltimore,
West Baltimore,
traveling 60 miles per hour.
He's going to Philadelphia
which is 80 miles away.
What kind of car?
Hey, he drivin' on l-95,
he need to watch out
for the state police.
They be profilin' niggas.
He ain't say Andre
was black, yo.
C'mon, Randy. "Andre"?
From the West Side?
- Hey, he ain't say he was black.
- Yo, you know he black.
Okay. Okay.
I said okay!
Mr. Prezbo.
You say he travelin' in a car.
Is he driving? Or is he
like in the back seat?
All right, you know what?
Fun is fun--
Hey.
Take your seats!
Everybody sit down!
Hey.
Everything okay in here?
Why isn't
Officer Massey present?
Working overnight
on the wire.
Attendance at all office
meetings is now mandatory.
Inform her.
And this Marlo Stanfield?
This is the best we can do?
- Sir?
- This is the guy
we're wasting months
chasing with a wiretap?
We could be on the street doing
a dozen other different things.
Stanfield is a comer.
He's got a lot
of West Side real estate.
How many bodies on him?
He fought a war against
the Barksdales last year
and dropped a few,
but nothing recent.
Nothing recent?
He owns West Baltimore
but with no bodies:
Maybe it's just me,
but in 18 years out there,
I have never seen
a carnivore eat a carrot.
He's been quiet
for a time--
"For a time"? This city's up
to its hips in blood
and you are sitting on
one guy with a history?
Okay, here's the new
world order, guys.
I want good, quick rips.
Six, 10,
12 felony cases a month.
That means no more long-ass wiretaps,
no more subpoenas,
no more mincing
around on shit.
We get out on the street
and come back with stats.
The Barksdale case
is closed,
and when the Stanfield wire
comes up for another 30 days,
we close out on that as well.
Understood?
You know,
to hell with this.
We got a wiretap up, and a judge
decides when it comes down.
Well, Detective,
the Deputy Ops is gonna
talk to you about that.
Table B.
Put those cards away.
Kareem Myers.
Sit down.
Yo, yo, listen, listen.
Kit Kats' $1,
Snicker bar's $1,
Warheads' $1,
Twizzlers' $1.
Man, Sour Patch 50c,
and gum 50c.
Anything you can get
at the store,
I can get in here
for y'all.
Gummy bears?
Gummy bears?
Ain't a problem.
I got Snickers, M&Ms.
Yo, check this price
and come holla at me.
Yo, I'm runnin'
a three-for-two discount,
and I'm taking personal
orders for tomorrow...
I'll be here tomorrow.
...so if you want something special,
just come holla at me.
There it is, yo.
Why not give me
a water pistol?
Hey, yo, Renaldo, you just
remember about how we gonna do.
It'll play.
Oye, Gordo.
The package.
Avanza, cabron!
With that raggedy-ass piece?
Nigga, is you crazy?
Loco or something?
Don't you know
the shit is bulletproof?
You don't understand--
You heard
what the boy said.
An' a box of Newports.
Where my change, yo?
Don't wild me.
Hey, yo, you see
the look on his mug?
That's the reason why
we get up every morning.
Okay! Okay okay.
Now, Andre's friend Yvonne
is supposed to meet him
in Philadelphia.
Yeah. Andre gonna
bone that skank.
Can you please shut up? Mr. Prezbo
is tryin' to teach us somethin'.
You shut up, bitch.
He ain't teachin' me nothin'.
Yvonne, though,
is coming from New York.
So my question
for you is--
A, who arrived in Philly first,
Andre or Yvonne?
And B,
by how much time?
And C...
who gives a rat's ass?
With this grant, the mandate
is not only to rethink
the way we utilize institutions,
but to help us start getting past
having to rely on jail
and drug rehab
as our only responses.
We're looking for a specific
target group to inoculate,
epidemiologically speaking...
Doctor, um, pardon me,
I'm not an academic.
Not by a long shot.
But, what exactly are you--
are you saying here?
He's sayin' he's got a lot of money
to come up with some way
to go at those boys out there
bangin' on the corners.
That's what I mean, yes.
So where do I come in?
Well, if the salary
arrangements are suitable,
your duties would be to
perform as a field researcher,
a liaison operating
in the, uh, urban environment.
You go out in the 'hood
and get him some
corner boys to mess with.
See? This is why
I need somebody like you
to be paired up with me.
I go out there
on my own--
And they sell
your tenured ass for parts.
In so many words.
Anyway, um, we're looking
for 18- to 21-year-olds.
This is where we see
the demographic peak
in violent behavior.
You excuse us
for a minute?
What happens when you
ain't around to translate?
Don't play ignorant
on me, Bunny.
You can back-and-forth
with any of these guys.
I've seen you work.
Besides, it's clear you ain't cut out
for the private sector.
18 to 21?
By that age,
they're deep in the game.
He's fucked on that.
So show him.
50,000, 80-20 health plan
and a take-home vehicle.
I'd be amazed if they
give you 30, an HMO
and a bus pass.
Peace.
See you later.
I go in there now,
you know what that makes me?
Some fucking asshole politician
who's running for office.
Watkins.
40th District.
You call the reporters?
All three channels
and "The Sun."
My condolences.
I'm Thomas--
I know who you are.
Thanks for your respects.
I'm so sorry
for your loss.
We shouldn't
be here today
just because your son
came forward as a witness.
What do you mean?
I know it's...
I'm just sorry for your loss.
That's all.
A parent's
worst nightmare.
I don't know how anybody
can go on after this.
Yeah, me neither.
Ms. Daniels.
Councilman.
How's things going over
in the 11th District?
Harder than I'd hoped for.
Even on the mayor's ticket.
Yeah. Eunetta's
pretty well entrenched.
Good luck
with it, though.
The council sure
could use you.
Councilman Carcetti,
can you give us a minute?
Councilman, over here.
Councilman, do you mind
doing a standup?
Look, guys,
I'm sorry, you know.
Now's not the time.
I don't really
have anything to say.
- I'm sorry.
- What, is he kidding?
What did we
come out here for?
You don't want the press coverage?
Are you out of your mind?
We'll get time on the 11 :00
from the visual alone.
But I start making speeches
right here? Now?
How's that
really gonna look?
Boss, as political theater,
this is pretty fucking lame.
Yeah, well, you know,
that depends on the audience.
This is Shawn Williams.
Lieutenant Mello,
please call shift commander.
Boss, you want me
to stay?
No. We're good.
So, Shawn...
You police. He ain't.
Shawn, how old are you?
18. How old are you,
you shinehead motherfucker?
You have
a sister, Shawn?
What the fuck
you want with my sister?
And what the fuck's
this Chuck E. Cheese-lookin'
motherfucker writing?
Let's say you hear that
your sister was assaulted.
Oh, who fucked
with my sister?
She wasn't.
I'm just saying--
Sayin' what?
Why you fuckin' with my head,
motherfucker?
And this bitch
is writing again.
It's a habit.
Now, what would you do
if you heard your sister
got beat up by some guy?
Which sister?
I don't know.
'Cause it's Cherise,
she probably had it coming.
All right,
another sister then.
Danielle?
I'd fuck that guy up.
I'd fuck his ass shut.
With you in jail.
I'd get my boy
to do it.
What if you didn't
have no boy?
Then I'd get the nigga
myself when I get out.
Well, what if you had
a life sentence?
Then I'll fuckin' escape.
And put
that fuckin' pen down
'fore I shove it up
your motherfuckin' ass.
What if you couldn't escape,
Shawn?
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Would you go
to the police?
Just a question.
Son, thanks for being you.
Thanks.
Look, I'm ready
to acknowledge that, um,
18-to-21 might be
too seasoned.
How you fixed
for juveniles?
Right now?
Fresh out.
The van to baby booking
just left.
But are you looking
for kids in the system?
Or just kids?
'Cause if it's just kids,
you got Douglass right around
the corner, and school's in this week.
High school? That's what?
15 to 18, right?
Yeah, but I would, uh--
I'd go younger even.
Kima. 'Sup, girl:
Are you sure?
C'mon. I'm the one
who took you out of the Eastern,
sent you to the show.
You can't come back here;
you too good for a district.
I need a home, major.
If you need to make a move,
move up or at least lateral.
But a district is
you going backwards.
And you don't need to be
under my wing, either.
You're gonna be valued
no matter where you land.
Let me talk to people.
I especially liked the timing
for when you flew your paper.
Shrewd.
I couldn't see anybody
shutting us down,
not with the elections.
What asshole would
risk the headline?
But to gut us
from the inside out...
Charlie Marimow.
My Trojan horse.
And now, let me guess,
to save your wire,
you're prepared
to go to Judge Davis.
If my memory serves,
this isn't the first time
a Deputy Ops felt
the need to bury you.
You have a gift
for martyrdom.
I wonder, though, are your
disciples as keen for the cross?
In your final court report,
it would be prudent
to tell the judge
the investigation
hit a dead end.
I doubt you'll
believe it, but...
I respect the effort.
You're a hell
of an investigator.
It would be too much
to expect you
to serve under
Lieutenant Marimow?
The man's a virus.
Oh.
Homicide, then.
That's you, right?
Yeah.
I know it's hard
right now, Detective,
but try to think
of this as a favor.
This seems right.
Yeah.
So I understand my old unit's gone
to Lieutenant Marimow.
Yes, it has.
So that unit is--
- Yes, it is.
- That's a shame.
I need to ask if you could
take care of my girl Greggs.
She's a good cop
looking for a home,
and I think she'd
be a natural homicide.
Hmm. Well,
there was an opening.
Oops. Just filled
that last night.
Another fugitive
from Major Crimes, but...
for you, Major?
Let me see who
I don't love no more.
Okay, so, if a rocket travels
say, 1,000 miles an hour,
how far does it go
in an hour?
Darnell.
Chiquan?
As far as it wants. I mean,
it's a rocket ship, right?
Randy?
Is this a trick question:
Nope.
1,000 miles?
On the money.
Oh, Mr. Prezbo,
I was gonna say that.
Go 'head, bitch.
Laugh at me now.
What? You want some?
You on the fucking
floor, bitch.
Laugh at me now.
- Hey!
- I don't hear shit.
Oh!
Crystal, have the office call 911,
and get the nurse.
Everybody in your seats.
Just lay still.
Just lay still.
Holy shit.
Just keep putting
pressure on it.
You're doing fine.
Chiquan, you're doing fine.
Just hold on
for a couple more minutes.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
You been nipping
at me all night, son.
Thing I got to figure is,
is you ready to
bite the whole ass?
Ain't me with
a mountain by my elbow.
Oh, so you
doing all right.
You like the Town Car?
You young'uns, you
all into them Lexus
and hum-fucking VSU
fucking U-ray or some shit,
I don't know.
See, but me?
I like me a Town Car.
Man look quiet and correct
in one of them.
So, I tell you what--
you win this,
you be sure to pick one
up for yourself, son.
Bye-bye.
Showtime.
Shit, nigger, turn.
Man got clubs.
One day soon I'm walking out
with a Rolls, hear?
Way you been going to school
up in this here room, son,
I suspect you're gonna
walk out of here
with Morgan-fucking-Freeman
to drive it for you, too.
See y'all
next time.
Yo.
I'm up the grocery
on Monroe.
All right.
Water, $1.
What the fuck?
You think I dream of
coming to work
up in this shit
on a Sunday morning?
Tell all my friends
what a good job I got?
I'm working to support
a family, man.
Pretend I ain't
talking to you.
Pretend like I ain't
even on this earth.
I know what you are.
And I ain't stepping to,
but I am a man.
And you just
clip that shit
and act like you don't
even know I'm there.
I don't.
I'm here.
Look, I told you
I wasn't stepping to you.
I ain't disrespecting you, son.
You want it
to be one way.
What?
You want it
to be one way.
Man, I don't
know what you're--
- You want it to be one way.
- Man, stop.
Stop saying that.
But it's the other way.
I'm saying, man, the way she
was all, "aah" on Chiquan,
Iike, like,
like, like,
"Laugh now,
stanky bitch!
Laugh now, huh?
How you like this?
How you like I cut your
titties off, huh?"
Man, get the fuck
away from me.
"How you like I carve
your pussy to your chin?"
Yo, come on, come on,
come on, come on.
- What?
- He said leave him be, so leave him be.
- I'm just saying.
- You're just saying.
That's all you
ever do, just say.
Dude, shit was
fucked up.
So it was fucked up.
Her father killed,
like, three police.
- What?
- Nah, it's true.
Her father killed like three police,
and her mama boil cats.
- Nigga, please, man.
- It's what I heard. She boil cats and
serve 'em and shit.
Serve 'em to who,
boiled-cat-eating motherfuckers?
- Who want him some boiled cats, huh?
- Heard that's how she live.
Nigger, you been boiled.
Laetitia live up one of them
group homes off Edmondson.
In them places,
you don't need to eat cats
to make you crazy.
Hey, Coach!
If the boy not coming, you might as
well let me and Michael go in the ring.
Ain't none of y'all
seen Spider today?
I ain't seen him.
Now how in the hell
he gonna fight next week
if he don't
show up to train?
I tell you what--
until the boy shows up
for his lesson,
you can lace 'em up and
step on the mat one time.
Ha ha ha!
No no no no no.
Not him.
Me.
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna show you as
gently as I can how much
- you don't know, a'ight?
- A'ight.
Yeah, nigger,
that's yo ass.
You about to get
yo ass whipped.
Your Sabbath best?
You hang around, you can see me
preach on some young'uns,
solemn left and
sanctified right.
Why you down here on
a Sunday, Deacon?
You need to see Ms. Donnelly
at Tilghman Middle.
She's got some custodial work,
you might call it.
Union wage.
- Custodial?
- See Ms. Donnelly tomorrow.
She can explain it
better than I can.
Tell me something--
how is it you got
so much wisdom
about who
should be where?
A good church man
is always up in everybody's shit.
That's how we do.
Yo, Coach,
you ready?
Who's winning?
No one wins.
One side just
loses more slowly.
Why don't we get
out of the house?
Take a walk.
It's a nice day.
I got this talk I got to
give to my first period...
about what happened.
An hour.
I got--
I gotta say something
to those kids.
I mean--
Okay.
See?
Somebody's winning.
I didn't expect
you till tomorrow.
I heard my new squad
had the weekend shift.
And besides, I figured
if I got my shit
out of Major Crimes
on the Sunday,
I wouldn't have to run into
that cocksucker Marimow.
Marimow does not
cast off talent lightly.
He heaves it away
with great force.
Freamon got
here Friday.
Yeah, Lester's
quick like that.
There's the colonel's office.
This is my humble abode.
The board.
And over here,
this is your desk.
- It's clean.
- You'll fix that.
A clean desk is
the sign of a sick mind.
Homicide.
Damn.
I don't know where
your chair went.
Make that your
first case.
And put that down, will you?
You live here now.
Ooh, look.
Actual po-lice work.
- Any of these?
- He the one, right there.
Just put it
to Fruit's head,
and the next thing Fruit
on the ground flopping,
and his girl
all screaming,
and this pink shit coming out
the side of his head.
"The Bunk,"
working weekends.
The man's dedicated.
I'm gonna partner you with
Crutchfield to get started.
You won't catch anything
as a primary for the first few months.
Give you time
to learn the basics.
Our H files by year.
Witness dump.
Our cut necktie
mausoleum.
The coffee...
and the mailboxes, arranged
by shift and squad.
Lester.
I believe you two refugees
know each other well.
Still getting your
head around it?
A bit, yeah.
You'll do fine.
Just fine.
As tender as this moment may be,
Detective, you've got mail.
You got Lyon
on your ass already?
Another switch-up
on the methane probes.
I'd call that number.
Get on top of that shit
before you catch a case,
chair or no chair.
What the hell is
a methane probe?
Hello, Kathleen O'Shea.
- Yes, hello?
- Mm-hmm.
I need to speak with Mr. Lyon
about the protocols.
I beg your pardon?
Mr. Lyon, please.
You sound a little
old for this, hon.
Excuse me?
Who is this?
This is Detective
Greggs with the--
This is
the Baltimore City Zoo.
Fine, and this is
Detective Greggs--
and you're calling
for a "Mr. Lion."
I'm sorry.
I misdialed.
Hee hee hee.
Methane probe.
- Scarred-up faggot.
- Hmm.
I need to
hunt him down,
'cause there ain't no protection
against that shit.
Huh.
Can't plan
against that nigger.
It's like, like,
you know what he's like.
What he like?
He like one of them
terrorist motherfuckers.
Just blowing up
shit just to.
Don't care who get hurt,
what kind of sense it makes.
He got a point.
And the government, right?
If they have one of
them terrorist attacks,
they cut Delta or
whoever some slack.
The insurance companies,
the banks,
the whole NASDAQ and shit get some
time to pay back what they owe,
because the government know
ain't nothing they could do.
Huh.
Yeah, I know you see it.
You see the big picture.
Problem with niggers today,
they always see the narrow view.
That's nice.
What?
Oh, you like that?
I had it for
a long time now.
It's got some
sentimental values.
- Just a thing.
- What's the real value?
- Huh:
- Real value:
I ain't much
for sentiment.
Oh, you know.
It's been a while
since I checked.
I mean, the fluctuation
in the global economy and all.
- I'll find out for you.
- You don't have to.
I'll find out for you.
Finger's swelled
over the years.
- Need some help?
- Yeah, man, you need help?
Nah, I got it,
I got it.
- Maybe use some spit.
- I don't want the man's spit.
No, I got it now.
Omar ain't no terrorist.
He just another
nigger with a gun.
And you ain't no
Delta Airlines, neither.
You just a nigger
got your shit took.
So, bring me
what you owe
and talk that global
economy mess somewhere else.
Feel me:
Yeah.
I got another game.
How much you
down already?
Learning their ways
requires some patience.
Some money, too.
How much you need
this time out?
A hundred and a half
ought to do.
A hundred and a half?
I take that chicken-nose
fool one day soon.
Take Super Stick, too.
Take 'em all.
Else, maybe I get bored,
send you to take 'em.
And my point,
Colonel Foerster,
is that your man Norris,
he's fucking the dog
on this, way I hear it.
Sir, this is
a top priority case,
and Norris knows there's a possibility
of a murdered state's witness.
We don't even know yet
if that was the motive
for the murder.
This is my point.
Norris is a pro, sir.
His clearance rate this
year says otherwise, Colonel.
Sir, Norris is
good police.
Look Ray, we need someone
who can work it hard,
work it around the clock,
work it till it falls.
And I understand we just pumped
some fresh blood into Homicide--
female, took one in
the line a few years back.
She's never
worked Homicide.
Fresh eyes, then.
But with all
due respect, sir,
if I could guarantee that
no further information
on this case would be
leaked to the press,
certainly not before
election day,
would it be
possible to keep
veteran investigators
working it, sir?
I resent the implication.
My apologies, sir.
You killing my time
coming up here.
And if you ain't noticed,
it's costing us money.
How am I gonna trust you
if you keep telling lies,
saying one thing
and doing another?
I just missed Friday,
that's all.
Look, think on it
like this--
School is work. They're the
same thing right now.
So, you skipping out on school
is like not showing up for work.
And I done heard, made up,
and tested every excuse invented.
So, unless you dead or dying,
there ain't none you can use.
I told you I'm-a go.
Yeah, okay, I know.
For school or out the business,
you are gonna go. Come on.
Falling behind now isn't the way
to start out a school year,
particularly after
a three-year hiatus.
We haven't seen you
since you enrolled.
Is there a reason
you haven't joined us?
Look, I know you reaching out
for Sherrod.
I want to apologize
for the boy
because he's been working hard
at helping me get a business going.
But he need
to be here though.
Ain't no
bout a-doubt it.
It's up to him,
isn't it?
That's what I've
been trying to say.
That's it right there.
What about it,
young man?
I'm good.
Okay.
One thing though been
bothering me, ma'am--
if Sherrod already missed
the last three years,
should he maybe be back in
the fifth or sixth grade,
instead of up with his age:
I mean, so he can
follow the work.
Social promotion.
Excuse me:
We don't have the resources
to repeat grade levels,
and we feel to place the older children
in the younger classes
is unfair to teachers who are
responsible for maintaining order.
Your nephew has been
socially promoted.
He's an eighth-grader,
headed to high school.
Sorry, but Ms. Johnson's
here about Qadriyyah.
Excuse me for a moment.
- Bill, this is nuts.
- I told him that.
You know if this gets out, who
do you think it's gonna land on?
I got two years to make
40 and a pension bump.
Look, I don't agree
with the call either,
but it's his call,
not yours, not mine.
He's the one
over at City Hall
every day getting
his ass chewed.
I don't care about
nothing you say, man,
'cause if you start
shit, you can't
complain how somebody
finish that shit.
Man, she was on her
from the beginning
with the mirror
and everything, man.
I wouldn't have waited.
Mr. Pryzbylewski,
this is Sherrod.
- And he's all yours.
- Okay.
Take a seat, Sherrod.
Okay, listen up.
I'd like to--
everybody--
everybody,
I'd like to talk--
Listen up!
Now, we all know
something, um,
unpleasant happened
here Friday,
and, look,
I know some of you are still trying
to get your heads around--
Ain't my head
got a big old gash.
And, uh, l'd
like to discuss--
- Yo, is it true that you police?
- What?
Miss Carmandy up in the office say,
"Mr. Prezbo, he police."
- Yo, you police, man?
- You ever shoot somebody?
I think we should
talk about--
He ain't shot no one.
Look at him. Yo,
you ever bust a man
named Ashanti Graham?
Sometimes when
something bad happens--
- That your dad?
- Nah, my brother.
Why can't you tell us
if you shot somebody or not?
- What kind of gun you carry?
- You Narco?
I used to be police.
Now I'm a teacher.
But being a police isn't
just about carrying a gun.
Yeah, right.
It's about working
with the community.
The community?
Y'all ain't been up in my community
in a long time except
to whale on people.
Yo, Mr. P,
you ever been shot?
I mean, like, bah.
Namond,
that's enough.
Get up.
Get up.
Get back in your seats.
Thank you,
very entertaining.
Sit down.
Get in your seats!
Sit down, sit down.
Kwaneese, sit down.
Sit down, now.
Yo, Mr. P, you ever
choke somebody dead like--
Yo, you ever
get videoed?
Mr. P,
Ashanti Graham.
You gots to know him.
He was a player for real.
He work Sunday
to Thursday,
7:00 early to
5:00 late.
So, it ain't no
moonlighting thing, then.
Nah, he ain't
no real police.
He full-time on this
Mickey Mouse shit here.
What he do again?
Talked back.
Go over Hilltop now?
Yeah, we got
that, too.
See ya.
Decision time, son.
Yo, what's your play?
Well, I told Little Kevin
right there
to shoot y'all both
in the head twice.
But seeing as he
done walked away...
Oh, you funny.
Yeah, I guess
I'm on your package.
Where the boy at--
Michael?
Well, he ain't
no regular.
He's just working
off a debt.
- Why? Why you care?
- Never mind you why.
"Why" ain't in your
repertoire no more, nigger.
60-40 split on that.
Do not be messing
with Marlo's money.
Randy Wagstaff,
you aren't a sixth-grader,
are you?
Uh, hey, Ms. Reese.
If you were
a sixth-grader,
it would mean you
and the rest of the knuckleheads
would still be in my
first-period English class.
And that would mean
it was two years ago.
And that would mean time stands
still at Tilghman Middle,
and that would
be a catastrophe.
I just forgot and
wore my old shirt today.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, if this isn't your lunch,
then where is your hall pass?
Why not just write
it in crayon?
Come on.
Deacon says you're
a good man.
Good enough to swing
a mop, I guess.
- A mop? More like a vacuum cleaner.
- What?
I get a few fellas like you
to help me out every September.
You go out
on the street,
you find these kids,
you drag them in.
Oh, a truant officer.
The system
hasn't been funded
for truant officers
in 20 years.
Where the hell you think you are,
Montgomery County?
Nah, I keep a couple
custodial positions
unfilled every year
just for this.
Those kids? You haul 'em in,
you cross 'em off the list.
Each kid, one time,
clear the list.
Come October,
you start on
the list again.
Job's yours if you want it.
Pays $12 an hour.
Excuse me, hon.
Sit.
Why'd you
leave class?
I got hungry,
couldn't concentrate.
Maybe, Randy, you had another
reason for running the halls, huh?
Tagging walls, maybe?
Uh-uh.
You know I don't.
I don't know anything.
I know it's the second week,
and I got walls
covered with tags.
Does that make you feel good,
walking past that?
- I don't know.
- Maybe you don't know,
'cause you're the one
doing the marking.
- I'm not.
- Then who is:
- Miss Thompson?
- Yes, ma'am?
Could you get me the number for
Randy Wagstaff's foster mom?
- Not a problem.
- What you want to call Miss Anna for?
Because you're skipping
class, running the halls,
maybe worse. She's
got a right to know.
- Is this her work number?
- Yes, ma'am.
Hold on. Wait.
The new girl, Greggs--
Sir, if I may,
respectfully--
Norris has
a full plate, okay?
The Braddock case
goes to Greggs.
His plate is fine.
No, it's not. His plate's a pile of
shit, okay? Listen to me.
Burrell wants this case
stalled until everybody votes.
And Rawls?
How the fuck I know
what Rawls wants?
He never said shit.
And let me tell you something,
even he knows this is fucked up.
I have this correct:
We are pulling a veteran off
a pending case and giving it to a rook
so as not to make timely
progress on said case?
The Braddock case
to Greggs.
- A pilot program?
- For one of your middle schools, yes.
- A $200,000 grant is attached.
- Free money.
- I'm just trying to help, Mrs. Conway.
- Help how?
You say that
your target group
is repeat violent
offenders.
Are you in any way
suggesting that
the system's lost
control of the school?
No no no, that's not what
I'm suggesting at all.
The system's fine.
The system's great.
I mean, this isn't
about the system.
We're just gonna
try to find a way
to get to some of
the troubled kids
who won't be in the
system too much longer.
Well, look, just make sure
there's no fuss.
I mean, nothing that gets
anyone upset, you know?
There's an election going on,
and we don't want to put our schools
- in the middle of that mess.
- No, indeed.
Humping a radio car
like a young sprite.
I'm a little bit
proud to know you,
- Officer McNulty.
- Just a little bit?
Well, it ain't like there aren't better
things you could be doing.
- Like what?
- See, I told you, Lester,
the worm has
turned for my boy.
So, I heard they
torpedoed your wiretap.
Yeah, they sent us
a new lieutenant.
- Marimow from E&T.
- "The Unit Killer."
Lester and Kima already
bailed to Homicide,
and now Sydnor's looking to jump
at the first good opening.
So, Major Crimes
is dead, huh?
Yeah, Lester
killed it good.
Went looking
for the money.
Guys like you,
you never learn.
- Guys like me?
- Yeah, 13 years--
- four months.
- Four months.
- Ha ha ha.
- You guys call for backup or what?
Yeah.
We got arrest papers
on a murder
for one Curtis Anderson,
aka "Lex."
He's been on the wing
for a couple of weeks,
so I don't expect him at
his mama's, but you never know.
- What's the address?
- 643 Harlem.
How about you taking the door
with me for old time's sake, Jim?
I'll take the back, gents.
- Oh!
- The back?
Damn, junior, the worm
has turned for you.
You know what they
say about the man
who volunteers
to take the back?
He buys.
B&O Tavern,
tonight at 9:00, son.
- I throw myself out after one.
- Shit.
You don't believe me,
ask Bunk.
True.
The bedroom's clear.
Yeah, basement, too.
Clear.
Yeah.
Clear.
9:00 tonight, McNulty,
B&O Tavern.
He's not here.
I told you.
Is he coming home again?
Ma'am, is
your son alive?
Because if he's not,
we can end
this right now.
Otherwise, we've
got a witness.
That gives us
a murder warrant,
and that warrant says that we
can come through your door
as many times
as necessary.
I don't know
where my son is.
It's like them birds
of yours.
They go out, and they
fly around the city.
They free to do
as they do.
End of the day,
they come back here,
get water, get fed,
'cause they know
you got this place
set up regular
as the rain.
No surprises, 'cause
at the end of the day,
a man don't want
no surprises.
You know,
birds neither.
Same as what
I'm offering.
You part of
a co-op,
a whole lot of surprises
you never worry about again.
You just do
as you do,
knowing the product
will always be there
and be
the finest quality;
knowing that if one
of yours takes a pinch,
he got a lawyer
and a bondsman
waiting for him before he
even step out the wagon.
I know how to
hire lawyers.
It ain't just
about the lawyers.
It's having a connection
so that you know
before the bust
even go down.
What I got to give up
to get that good dope?
Muscle.
You got muscle.
You stand with us,
we run these New York boys
right out of East Baltimore.
Fuck I care about
East Baltimore:
The point of the co-op
is we stand together.
We share information,
and no one fucks
with any of us.
No one fucks
with me now.
Well, that don't
mean there couldn't be
some unforeseen cir--
No one fucks
with me now.
African colors. Subtle.
Tony Gray is
pulling 24% now.
You need new colors and
a new message, Clarence.
You need to
rally the base.
You want me to start
wearing dashikis?
Go all Marion Barry
and shit?
I'll tell you what
I would like--
another 75 in cash
for walk-around money.
75, huh?
Call another game.
It's a waste of time,
and right now,
time is everything.
They're gonna spit in your eye
and endorse Royce.
They only waited this long out
of respect to Tony Gray.
Otherwise, they give
it to Royce months ago.
That's not the point.
You go there uninvited, and you're
only gonna piss them off.
Am l? Or do I piss them off
even more
by pretending that
they don't exist,
that I don't need them?
I've door-to-doored every
neighborhood in this city,
saying I'm ready to be
mayor to all of it,
not just my base,
but all of it.
What does it say I don't
go see these guys?
He's right.
They endorse Royce, fine.
The hell else they gonna do?
But what they say
and don't say
from the pulpit that Sunday
before the primary,
we still got a dog
in that fight.
I do this right,
they'll respect it.
And if they don't,
at least they get to see
a begging-ass
white man on his knees.
Always a feel-good
moment for the folks.
And as to my attendance
at council meetings,
those who know
the job understand
there is more to
being a councilperson
than just the meetings.
Yes, Charles?
Yeah, they putting a halfway house at
the end of my block. Addicts and such.
Not if I have anything
to say about it.
Where you living
at, sir?
800 block North Carrollton.
Oh, I'm gonna take
a look into that.
Is there anyone
with a question
for any of
the other candidates?
Anyone with an issue,
a concern?
Well, I would say
that with regard to
the gentleman's concern
about the halfway house,
that while I share
your concern,
it's also true
that the city has
thousands of drug
addicts in recovery,
and those halfway houses
and shelters have to go someplace.
Though not in
white neighborhoods.
Ma'am, could I see that,
that Royce flyer?
- Thank you.
- Well, that is a fair point as well.
But these are people--
our brothers and sisters,
our children, our friends.
And they are trying
to change their lives,
and so it's up to us to
be responsible for them.
Feel good to miss
a hand, huh?
What's the point?
Eventually, we all
got to ante up.
Yeah, we do.
But I can't believe he
had the balls enough
to call two games
in one month.
I mean, please.
He's loading up on
walk-around money.
He wants cash on the street
come election day.
Carcetti got to him.
Called it a war chest.
Maybe we got us
a war this time.
I wouldn't mind if he wasn't
so fucking ugly with it.
That two pair he bet on,
right into Roger's trip nines.
I folded on a flush.
Full boat, four hands ago.
It's immoral,
what it is.
So, what's
the game, gents?
Clarence's deal.
Texas Hold 'Em.
I begin to understand
the popularity of this game.
No limit.
Oh, peachy.
I was beginning to
think you'd lost it, son.
That living room
shrine of hers
would have shamed
Elvis and Tupac both.
Her son's deader
than both of 'em.
She's just too scared
to say so.
That shit wasn't
there the first time
I talked to her.
I'd have seen it.
- You being a detective and all.
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.
Hey, look,
she got a friend.
She too young
for you, boy.
Young?
They get younger, William.
Skinnier, too. We don't.
Younger, skinnier--
where's Jimmy?
That's just the nature of
things. Age is age,
fat is fat,
and nature is nature.
- Aw, pitiful.
- And pitiless.
Nature don't care.
Nature just is.
Now my boy Marlo, I thought
he was skewing that.
Screwing what?
- The boy's a young lion.
- "Hello, is Mr. Lyon home?"
And a lion has
to have his kill.
"Methane probe
for Mr. Lyon."
- So then where are my bodies?
- Hmm.
Here I am over here
on the one hand
without a body
in six months,
and here you are
looking for a suspect
who's most likely dead,
and most likely for
dropping one of Marlo's.
Then again, if he's dead,
where's that body?
You know what
the plural of pussy is?
Puss-i.
Jimmy taught me that.
Where's he putting
the bodies, Bunk, huh?
In the sewers:
Rogue funeral
home, maybe?
Yeah, they teach
that fancy-ass Latin
at them Catholic
schools, they do.
- You remember the Eddy Crane case?
- Mmm-hmm.
Word was they put
him in an acid vat
down near Curtis Bay.
Oh, they're coming
up on us now.
Now, for a West Side boy
like Marlo Stanfield,
that would be the traditional
dumping grounds,
- Hey, girl. How are your doing?
- Right?
- Hey, girl.
- Right?
What?
Oh, man.
Jimmy.
Jimmy.
Tying to get some
of that puss-i.
What the hell you still
sitting here for?
Fucking Huxtables
and shit, right?
There they go
right there.
He's still
with school.
Shit. Just so they can
spring out that shit pile every day.
Make a good run
at that boy,
he'll be on a corner,
no problem, man.
Yeah, we gonna see.
You hung-over?
Just saying you
look like shit.
You know what you need
at a crime scene?
- Rubber gloves.
- Soft eyes.
Like I'm supposed
to cry and shit?
You got soft eyes,
you can see the whole thing.
You got hard eyes,
you're staring at
the same tree,
missing the forest.
Oh, Zen shit.
Soft eyes, Grasshopper.
Lividity puts the time
of death at 7:48,
- give or take.
- Noted.
You're gonna want
to get a chemstat.
- You think?
- Couldn't hurt.
A CDC, too?
Splatter distance?
Yeah, definitely.
You know, where the hell
did my Q-tips go?
Don't sweat it.
I got mine right here.
Oh, good. It's cool.
You want to take a look?
Won't bite.
Hey, uh, don't forget
the, uh, stippling.
I'm a rookie:
There's something
in his hand.
Oh, yeah?
Give her some
tweezers.
"Tater killed me."
Oh, is it typed?
'Cause that would hold up
a lot better in court.
Phone number in
the other hand.
A standard
confidentiality agreement.
And this one?
Oh, that one
indemnifies us
should you or any of
your staff be injured.
- Who wants to get some learning today?
- This way. Move.
- I roll up front with you?
- You got dibs in the back, little man.
- Come on. Hey...
- Don't worry about him.
- We'll catch him later.
- Yeah, little man's so excited
about what's on that blackboard,
he gonna race us.
What's the line
on us so far?
In the teacher's
lounge, I mean.
They're saying you're
this year's Band-Aid.
Is that how
you feel?
I was hoping for
more than that.
This year's
splint?
Hey, Miss Sampson.
Yo, he police.
I mean, the school
system seems benign.
And I get the sense
North Avenue
might give us some
latitude, if not support.
- You think so?
- You sound doubtful.
You can tell the days
by their faces.
The best day
is Wednesday.
That's the farthest
they get from home,
from whatever's going
on in the streets.
You see smiles then.
Monday is angry.
Tuesdays, they're caught between
Monday and Wednesday,
so it could go either way.
Thursdays...
they're feeling
that weekend coming.
Friday, it's bad again.
This is where
I leave you.
Oh, your class.
Language arts, huh?
Yes.
Anyway, you should
see it without me.
They behave differently
when I'm around.
No doubt.
What do you think
this 20 stands for?
No, it's not the number
of days you've been suspended.
It's not the number
of years you'll spend
in prison if you
don't shape up.
It's 50% below average.
It's 30% below
failure even.
But, really, it stands
for the amount of interest
you're taking in
your own future.
The next question
is worth two points.
Who can tell me why was
Clarence Mitchell, Jr. important
- to the civil rights movement?
- I know. I know.
And I can tell by
Shalanta's smile,
she's gonna win
for the blue team.
Hey, yo, did you see that one
over there? Hey.
Anybody here
DeShawn Price?
Never heard of him.
And what's your name?
Herbert Brown. This
the roundup van, right?
Oh, yeah,
here you go, my man.
Come on.
Oh, no, yo, no.
Yeah, see, "Howard Brown."
That's my brother. He over
on McHenry Street if you want him.
I was just in
school on Friday,
so I'm phat till
October. Sorry.
- Whoa, hold up, my man.
- Nah, he's right.
School gets a certain
amount of money
for each kid that shows
up one day in September
- and one day in October.
- One day?
After that, they don't
lose the government money,
so we done with it.
Nah nah, man.
School is school.
Yeah, well, I'm just trying to
school you, brother.
All right,
which one of y'all still
need your September day?
Get it over with now,
we won't be messing
with y'all later.
What up, Butch?
How do we begin?
You the one
called the meet.
Why don't we begin by you
respecting my time and getting to it?
First of all,
I heard you may be
under the impression
I was somehow involved
with the late Mr. Bell,
in his play against you
with Brother Mouzone.
I was no way involved.
Stringer came at me
to set up the parley
with you.
He used me like
he used y'all,
I feel the need to say.
It's said then.
Tip out on it.
Businessman such as myself
does not believe
in bad blood
with a man
such as yourself.
- Disturbs the sleep.
- Oh, I bet it do.
By way of amends,
a proposition.
I know of a card game
on the West Side--
high rollers,
lots of cash money,
boxcar-sized.
You trying to
set me up, Joe?
You ever known me
to be stupid?
I'm trying to make things
right here with you.
How much we talking about?
If there ain't at least
a few hundred K in that room,
I wish myself blind.
Serious, Joe.
I say again,
have you ever known me
to be a stupid man?
- What are the strings?
- No strings.
- What's your cut then?
- Quarter of the take.
I scope this and it
don't look right,
I'm gonna come back
on you now, Joe.
Where did everybody go?
- Which one of you is Sergeant Hauk?
- Sir.
- And you must be Dozerman.
- Yes, sir.
Welcome to Major Crimes.
I'm Lieutenant Marimow.
I see you just made
sergeant after driving
the mayor around for less
than three months.
You must be
a hell of a driver.
Anyone here?
Greggs? Freamon?
Sydnor and Massey.
And they're on the street,
making rips.
That's what we
do here now.
We get on the street
and we rip and run.
Can you get
with that, Sergeant?
The Western
District way, sir.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Thanks for seeing me.
I understand you've
already heard from
Mayor Royce and
from Councilman Gray,
and I'd like to thank
you for being able
to join in this process.
I don't expect to walk out
of this room today
with an endorsement from
the lnterdenominational
Ministerial Alliance.
I don't.
But the point is...
I think I can be a better mayor for
Baltimore than the present one.
I voted for Clarence Royce
eight years ago.
I voted for him four
years after that.
I felt there was
promise in the man.
But now
I'm disappointed.
I'm disappointed
and I'm angry
at the crime
and the waste
and the damage done
to so many neighborhoods.
Not just in my district,
but here on the West Side--
Pimlico, Cherry Hill,
Edmondson Village.
Wherever I go, people
want the same things.
They need the same things,
but they're just
not getting them.
I'm gonna change that.
I'm not gonna ask
for your vote now.
Maybe I haven't
earned it yet.
But I am here to say
that when I am mayor,
my door is open to you, regardless
of who you endorse.
And I want you to remember
that I came here today
to say these things.
Thank you.
Councilman.
Thank you for coming.
Okay, I'm gonna need an APB
on a motherfucker named Tater.
"Call Mr. Sweet ASAP"?
Let me guess--
The Gay and
Lesbian Alliance.
Uh-oh.
She's catching on, boys.
Oh, and what do you want?
Another methane probe?
Or some other
"CSl" bullshit that don't exist?
You're the primary
on the Braddock case.
The dead witness.
Norris is back
in the rotation.
What?
You caught your first murder.
Kudos.
Come on, man, damn.
Bam bam, yeah.
Do that to whoever
be snitching.
Who snitching?
Don't know,
but kids be snitching.
Rashid got suspended
for tagging walls, yo.
Y'all ain't heard?
How you know he ain't just
get caught with a paint can?
'Cause Ms. Donnelly came and
pulled him out of the classroom.
Bam.
Yo, I'll see
y'all later, man.
Yo, you going
past the gym?
All right, man.
Peace, peace.
I ain't gonna tell
you again.
Give me the remote.
Did y'all learn
something today?
Y'all learn
something today?
Yeah.
What y'all learn?
I said give me
the remote.
- Mmm-mmm.
- Give it.
Math your favorite, right?
Start with it.
I like math.
Yeah, you good
at it, too.
Watched this show
five damn times.
Hey, you good?
All right now.
So, it turns out
the one girl...
200-something stitches
to close her up.
She's looking at a lot of rehab
and maybe more surgery.
The muscles in her face
don't even move right.
How's the class seem:
Like it didn't
really happen.
They're still processing. I know
it doesn't seem so, but they are.
What about Laetitia?
What happens to her?
Nothing worse
than she's already seen.
She'll probably go to
a juvenile facility,
which is only a little
worse than her group home.
She was in a group home?
She grew up
in the system.
Monday-to-Friday angry.
Last year, she was
suspended twice,
and then expelled.
Chiquan wasn't
positive though,
if you're looking for
a silver lining and all.
Excuse me:
She didn't have HlV,
in case you were worrying.
Marcus. Boy, what are you
trying to do?
You trying to
get knocked out?
Drop your head, son.
Left up! Get that left up!
Pick your hand up.
Damn!
Man, that boy
listen to anyone?
All right, all right.
Time, time.
Not bad, y'all.
Not bad, Justin.
Marcus, you got to concentrate,
man. Think.
All right?
Listen, I got tickets
to the fights tonight,
Pikesville Armory.
Now, I was gonna
take Justin and Spider,
but Spider ain't
been hanging out,
and, Marcus, I know you
got your mother, right?
So, Michael,
you want to see
the fights?
- You going?
- Yeah, I'm in.
Yeah, all right.
All right.
Come on, get this
headgear off.
What the fuck
is that?
Souvenir.
What?
Trouble with doing
it this way,
disappearing
'em and shit--
Nobody knows.
I remember when
I was a kid,
if you had a map
of the world,
the playground over
at Baker and Moreland
would be at
the center of it.
And as I got older,
the playground just
kept on getting bigger,
went beyond
the neighborhood.
Everything changes,
you know?
One minute
the ice cream truck
be the only thing
you want to hear.
Next thing, them touts
calling out the heroin
be the only thing
you can hear.
What's that?
Workbook I need
to use with this.
So you read from
the small one
and answer questions
in the big one?
Yeah, ain't no thing.
Yeah, I see that.
I see that.
All right, you see how
he keeping his hands up?
Look at his feet.
Look at their feet.
See how they keep
their feet moving?
See what I'm saying?
See how he stay
in close?
That's how you take
away his power.
Yo, dude is cut.
Yeah, man.
That's discipline.
You take care your body,
your body take care of you.
Yo, I bet his woman
is fine, man.
Yeah, I bet
she is, too.
Flush to the queen.
Full house.
All right, everybody,
Iet me see them
hands, yo.
Hands.
Hey, yo, big man,
back up.
I don't know about cards,
but, uh, I think these four-fives
beat a full house.
Hey, yo, banker,
cash me out, yo.
Boy, you want a head on
that body, you best hop to.
That's my money.
Man, money ain't
got no owners,
only spenders.
I tell you something else--
I like that ring, too.
Boy, you got me confused
with a man repeats himself.
This ain't over.
Oh, that's how you
carrying it, Shorty, huh?
'Cause I can find
your peoples
a whole lot easier
than they can find me.
Wear it in health.
No doubt.
You see what I'm
talking about, Justin?
That's what I'm saying.
That's the real deal.
You keep training, I'm telling you,
boy, you can get there.
See, the last fight
was the best.
The Puerto Rican boy
had a good left.
Yeah, shit was tight.
Oh, this is it,
right here on the right.
All right.
- All right now.
- All right,
- I'll see you tomorrow, Coach.
- All right.
All right, now,
so you live over on--
Hey hey, my boy,
what you doing?
- I'm gonna take you home.
- No, no, thank you.
Michael, come on now,
serious.
Nah, no thank you.
I'm good from here.
See, to cap a motherfucker,
you put a pistol to his head,
say, "pow," and he tagged.
- But when Chris and them do it--
- Yo, it ain't working, Na'.
- I know you making this up.
- Word to my mother, yo. Lex ain't dead.
I seen him creeping in an alley
last night near the playground.
Everybody know Lex is dead.
Nah, there's dead,
and there's special dead.
Yeah, Chris working
that juju shit.
Nah, man, what I'm saying
is they zombies.
Why you think he take them into vacants?
He need time to change them.
You don't believe me,
yo, it's on you.
Yo, they funnin',
ain't they, Michael?
I don't know about
that voodoo shit, man, but Chris
is definitely doing something--
get a nigger to walk up in there
knowing he about
to get capped, man.
Chris, he different. You can tell
by them coon-ass country clothes
that nigger be wearing.
Nine?
Nah, too much bark.
Probably a.40-cal.
Yeah, man,
this is serious business.
So you saying
Lex is a zombie?
Pookie, Byron,
all them niggers.
- And Chris?
- Yeah, Chris-- Zombie Master.
I knew this
wasn't going away.
That's what we've been trying
to tell you, yo. Chris got the power.
He tell them to come,
and they gotta come--
Iike the devil do
with the damned.
What you think
Chris got them doing?
They're probably
spies, man.
Can't figure any other way
Marlo knows so much.
Yeah, that's what it is. Like in this
movie, "Zombie Killer" or something.
They came out at night, hunting.
- Hunting?
- Yeah, man. They--
Yeah, and in that movie they was
snatching people up,
stealing their warmth.
St. Jude, patron
of lost causes.
Tell me you ain't
been on bended knee
whispering in his saintly ear
each and every night
before you close
those peepers.
I know you have, Tommy,
catch a break like this.
Stan, you're sure
about this?
On my mother's soul.
It's a lock.
Assigned a rookie--
a broad, no less--
as lead detective.
Pulled a good man off,
too, I heard.
Hmm. Tom.
Tommy, remember--
anything you need.
He's a piece of work.
Valchek?
Comes with the territory.
You want the First District
council seat,
you make nice with whatever Polish
or Greek commander
- they dump in the southeast.
- Not ltalian.
No, there ain't enough of us left
down there.
- You think he has this right?
- That Royce tampered with the case?
No way the mayor knows.
You're right. This one has Ervin Burrell
written all over it.
Fuck if the mayor knows or not.
If it's true,
we get it out there quick
and bang him hard.
- I go public?
- They can't spin this.
They sabotaged
a criminal case.
No spin on a knuckleball, you still
can't tell how it's gonna break.
We feed it to Tony Gray. We keep
ourselves out of the line of fire,
sting Royce,
and as an added bonus,
give Gray's campaign
a boost
which comes at the expense
of the mayor's base.
I'm a devious motherfucker
once I get going.
So all told,
we're looking at 13 warrants
and six locations.
And given my staffing
situation...
Not a problem.
I can give you my D.E.U.,
Flex, and Ops squads.
- A sector of uniforms if you need it.
- Great.
The problem is, you're wasting a wiretap
on street-level arrests.
We do these raids right,
we might catch Marlo
or one of his lieutenants
at one of these locations,
- get them with dope on the table.
- Marlo Stanfield--
in a room,
with dope on the table?
I've kicked down doors
and surprised bigger players than him.
Well, let me warn you,
Lieutenant--
I am not about
to litigate a wiretap
for a handful
of street rips.
Well... that's on you,
Counselor.
No, it's not.
Major, see you tomorrow.
Floaters--
you had any more?
- No more than usual for the season.
- What about decomps?
What do you got
in the decomp room?
- Two or three unidentifieds.
- Found in Baltimore?
No. Actually,
two from Prince George's,
- one from Dorchester.
- Nah, he wouldn't drive that far.
Let me get
this straight:
You're looking for extra bodies,
no one in particular,
other than this one kid you already
put out on the teletype.
Yeah. You on it.
You fellas
don't have enough work?
If you do your classwork,
homework,
you earn stickers.
Dag, yo, every day
you be changing it up.
You got us confused, Mr. P.
Behave in class,
that's another sticker.
At the end of the week, the four
with the most stickers get a prize
and are eligible for a grand drawing
at the end of the month.
Don't do your work,
misbehave in class...
...your name goes here.
Detention-- a full hour after school,
no exceptions.
So it's up to you--
stickers for prizes
or stay with me
after school.
Yo, Mr. P., why you do me
detention, huh?
You interrupted
the class, Namond.
Yo, when you first came in here,
you was all treating us straight up,
and now you just dog me
before I even know the rules.
That ain't right, man.
When you're right, Namond,
you're right.
Hey, Mr. P., I want me
some of them stickers.
Zenobia,
you have to do your work.
I want to,
but I ain't got no pencils.
I don't want
no damn welfare pencil!
It seems to me
there are two kinds of kids
walking in this building--
stoop kids
and corner kids.
- Excuse me?
- You know, stoop kids
stay on their front steps
when their parents tell them.
The others go down
to the corners.
They can't sit still in the class.
The others can and do.
- So separate the two.
- That's tracking.
- Excuse me?
- Tracking students.
It's a nasty phrase
in educational circles.
It refers to the grouping of children
based on expected performance.
- What's wrong with it?
- It says you have reduced expectations
for certain students, that you expect
less from them academically.
So you pretend
to teach all these kids,
and the truth is,
you ain't teaching any of them.
But what if
the stoop kids
could be in classrooms
where there was no disruptions?
- And the corner kids?
- They're the ones you're after, right?
That's why you got
the grant money.
As long as this doesn't involve
warehousing children,
I'm for anything that
allows me to do my job.
Every teacher here
will tell you the same.
The trick for you is
to come up with a program
that actually addresses itself
to the corner kids.
We start pulling kids out of regular
classes-- won't they be stigmatized?
There's not a stigma in being
booted out of class every other day?
Question is,
how do we identify
the corner kids?
That won't be a problem.
Okay. Okay.
You understand the work?
Come on, this is easy.
I know you can do it.
You're not giving me a choice.
You have detention.
Yo, Na', Mrs. D.
shaking bushes.
Back to your seats.
What the fuck?
She got my blade, yo.
I said,
"Back to your seats."
Yo, Mrs. D. be stealing shit.
I ain't never gonna
get my blade back.
Yo, what are you all up on me for?
I do my work.
I'm not your yo.
Show me your work.
Yeah, I see.
Yo, my hand hurting from all this
learning. You got some Tylenol?
What I got for you
is detention.
Oh-hh!
- You know what? Fuck you, Prezbo.
- Oh-hh!
Fucking gimpy-assed,
big-grill motherfucker.
That's it.
You're out of here!
Go!
Get your police stick
out your desk and beat me.
- You know you fucking want to.
- Oh-hh.
Everyone, back in your seat.
The fuck you
looking at, bitch?
Oh-hh, Ms. Sampson, l--
Namond Brice, if you weren't headed
to the main office,
- you are now.
- Yeah, I was just--
One of the corner
kids, huh?
Yeah, they do step up
when you need them, don't they?
Look, what? You want me to say
you right? You right.
I should have had protection
at the card game.
Done is done.
Now we need to decide what we're
gonna do about Omar.
You make the price right,
somebody gonna get a whiff of that
bushwhacker's ass.
Now you take it
from there.
You think so?
I ain't saying Omar can't be got.
Any nigger can be got.
But once we put
word to ear
and he learn that
we pricing out his head,
he's gonna be trying us
like we're trying him.
- You saying I should let it slide?
- Nah.
Nah, we get at him
another way,
get at him without no bounties,
no bullshit like that.
Barksdale turned this town upside down
hunting him,
and all he ended up looking
was weak.
I ain't no Barksdale.
I'm just saying
talk is cheap.
We sit on it, we gonna figure out a way
to get that faggot.
But till then we don't
say a mumbling word.
I got me six now, and I'll give you
the four later, all right? Come on!
- Nah. I'm gonna need the whole 10 now.
- Sherrod!
- You ain't in school?
- I'm half a day-- teachers' meeting.
Come on, I told you about
those lame excuses, man.
- I was talking to him first.
- Ain't no need for physical contact--
You got $4 for me?
I'm short $4.
What the fuck
are you talking--
Got a cart full of shit, nigger.
What you got for me?
I know you holding.
Where's it at?
You ain't hear?
Okay.
It's in my shoe--
my shoe.
Don't need
the four now, son.
Damn, yo, where the shovel at?
Bury that nigger, man.
Here you go, sir,
thank you.
- Tommy Carcetti, running for mayor.
- Good luck, Tommy.
- Hey, Mr. Carcetti, you got my vote.
- Thanks.
- Tom Carcetti.
- Hey, thank you very much.
- Here you go.
- Good luck, Councilman.
How you doing?
Tommy Carcetti, running for mayor.
Okay, Councilman,
time to hit the West Side.
Pretty motherfucker--
he's gonna make me go
to my game face.
Okay, I'll take 25 of the honeysuckle
incense cones--
they'll keep me
healthy for next week.
- Tommy!
- Excuse me.
Tony Gray's people say
20 minutes at their place.
Shit, Clarence.
Look like you did in '98
when you surprised
the hell out of everyone.
Just bring 'em on.
Why give it to us? Why don't you
stick it to Royce yourself?
Because after what Tommy did
at the debate,
it'll seem like more of the same
if it comes from him.
And if we use it to take four
or five points out of Royce's base,
it helps him as much as us.
Once bitten, twice shy.
With Tommy Carcetti,
I got to always think a step ahead.
Look, Tony, you ain't gonna win.
So the only question is
whether you wanna lose
with 24% of the vote
or 28%.
You bring the numbers up,
you look good
for the legislature--
maybe a congressional run.
- Albert Stokes.
- Here.
Mr. P., can I go? My moms told me to go
straight home after school.
Mine too.
You should have thought of that
before you smeared ink
all over my desk.
Weren't my fault.
My pen exploded.
Michael.
Michael Lee?
Mr. P., please,
can I go?
I ain't eat no lunch, and my stomach
making all these noises.
Look, I won't ever disrespect
your pencil again, I promise.
Zenobia, it wasn't
about the pencil.
Please, Mr. P.
- Okay okay, all right.
- All right.
Just this one time,
I'll make an exception.
But next time, expect
to stay the full hour.
- Why are you here?
- Came to say sorry.
I didn't mean to get
all up in your face like that.
I appreciate that, Namond.
It takes courage
to admit when you're wrong.
What I can't understand-- I've seen you
in Ms. Sampson's class doing your work.
- Why can't you do the same in here?
- I mean to, I do.
It's just the evil get in me and before
I know it, I go off.
Well...
tomorrow we'll see
if we can do better.
Can't tomorrow.
Mrs. D. put me out.
I gotta bump.
Later, Mr. P.
If you can wait
outside...
It's okay.
He can stay.
Thank you.
Mr. P., you know
Michael can't make it to detention.
I know he didn't.
Now it's doubled.
- He's got two days to serve.
- Nah, I mean, he can't.
He got to go pick up
his little brother from school.
Well, he'll just have to
find somebody else to do that.
It-- it ain't like that.
I mean, Michael would come
if he could,
but wouldn't have nobody else
to pick up his little brother Bug.
You know, his mother,
she on that stuff.
We walking home.
You coming?
Oh, no, I'm waiting on Alpo.
Ms. Sampson got him doing detention.
- You gonna be here till, like, 5:00.
- Yeah, she a hard lady.
She don't ever give
a brother no play.
- All right. I'll holla at you later.
- All right, yo.
So you're not gonna be
in the NBA?
Then it must be the NFL?
I thought all the boys in class
were gonna join the pros.
Nah, that's just
something we say.
So what about you?
What do you wanna be
when you grow up?
I'm gonna own
my own store.
That's smart. You're gonna need
to know a lot of math.
You left them in there.
- Oh-hh.
- Hey, don't worry, Mr. P.
We got you.
Hey, Donut!
- Yo, yeah.
- Donut's crazy with cars.
He can open anything.
- Hey. What up, man?
- Hey.
Yo, he locked
his keys in there.
It's okay,
I can call AAA.
Oh, no problem, chief.
Feel the need
to work them corners, huh?
I'm just asking 'cause you don't need
to be doing what you're doing.
I need to learn some shit
on my own.
I'm trying
to help you, Sherrod,
but you making it
so I can't.
I didn't even know
the man who beat on you, Bubs.
He was short money
on the corner.
I swear he wasn't
nothing to me.
Yeah, but when the shit start,
there's nothing to be done, right?
What would I have done
if he started whaling on you?
Same kind of nothing, see?
That's how the corners be.
They going to use you up,
Sherrod.
You welcome to stay tonight, but you
ain't in school tomorrow morning,
this partnership need
to be done.
These two precincts
are the bellwether for the Fifth.
If you can take even 18%
out of Carcetti in these,
it's a good guess he won't
have the numbers citywide.
And who are we ticketed
with over here?
The N.D.O.,
I hope, because...
...this amid allegations that
high-ranking police officials intervened
to have a veteran police detective
removed from the controversial case.
The Braddock murder became
a focal point in the mayoral campaign
when Councilman
Thomas Carcetti alleged
the West Baltimore man
was killed
because he was
a witness in the case.
...Because they were afraid
the police would prove
what they most fear, that
Fredro Braddock was murdered
because he was a witness,
and the city failed to protect him.
It's on all three channels.
And "The Sun" and "The Post"
are both calling for comment.
And my sources within the department say
the rank-and-file officers
are simply appalled by this blatant
political manipulation.
Damn, turn it up.
Hey, Greggs, you're famous.
...is to remove
a highly-decorated veteran
with 15 years' experience as a murder
investigator without reason...
- That'd be me.
- Then replaced with a rookie
who has yet to handle a single
homicide investigation...
- That'd be you.
-...then we need to rethink...
- The fuck I ever do to him?
You gonna make it
too heavy, yo.
It might work
if we make it bigger.
It would work if we
had balsa wood, you know?
- It's really light and strong.
- Man, you so full of--
oh, shit.
Zombie Master.
Need to take us
a little walk.
Nah, I'm good here.
Yo. Young'uns need
to move along.
Sure, Chris, we'll bump.
- Yo, Snoop, your sister in my class.
- What the fuck?
You high
or something, nigger?
You boys be
smoking that shit?
Hearing good things
about you.
Say you straight up,
take care of your people,
not begging no handouts.
Motherfucker, you hear the nigger
talking to you,
giving you praises and shit. You
standing here looking fucking stupid.
Yo, chill.
Sometimes
she get a little hot.
I'm just saying
the boy ain't right!
Yo, we always in the market
for a good soldier.
When we see one we like,
we take care of the situation--
take him in, school him,
make him family.
And if you're with us,
you're with us,
just like we'd be
with you all the way.
You have a mind,
you're in.
Look, man.
I already got a family--
my moms
and my little brother.
Yeah, heard that.
But think on it.
We'll be around
if you need something.
He saw me, yo. I knew it.
I knew Chris was asking Michael
about me.
I knew it, man.
I'm dead.
- Yo, man, good looking out.
- Yeah.
- I thought they was gonna--
- Yeah, I know, I know.
What-what he ask about me?
I know he asked about me.
- What'd you say? What'd you tell him?
- Calm down,
- it weren't even about you.
- Yo, for real,
you need to tell me.
What did he ask you?
Yo, you right, man.
Chris was all up in your business.
He down on you
for some deep shit, man.
I don't even know what.
Nah, I'm just fucking
with you, man.
He didn't even
speak your name.
Oh, man.
So, Erv, what's next? Your officers
gonna shoot a couple of tourists?
Maybe fly a helicopter
into Harbor Place?
What can we expect the last week
of my re-election campaign?
Sir, I did what you asked--
no more, no less.
Hamsterdam--
legalized drug zone?
Oh, he takes responsibility
for that.
- The subpoenas all over town.
- That, too.
Well, then the leak about the witness
murder. That was his shop too, right?
- Hell, yeah.
- And now this last thing,
transferring detectives off the case--
what is that? What is that?
- Scuttling the investigation.
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, that's awful-- Jesus!
- Mr. Mayor, you asked me
- to slow that investigation down.
- Mm-mmm, mm-mmm.
Subtle, Ervin. Hmm?
You hold a few facts
for a few weeks.
You put a report or two
in a desk drawer.
But the transferring
of people off a case?!
Look, you told me...
you specifically
wanted me to not--
Ervin, you may leave.
- Mr. Mayor--
- That will be all, Commissioner.
Nuh-uh.
No, I need a word or two
with your deputy, Ervin.
Have a seat.
I tried to warn him.
I mean, if it leaked out of Homicide
about the dead witness,
why wouldn't it leak that we
bumped a detective?
Why didn't you come to us
beforehand?
I'm a loyal subordinate,
Mr. Mayor,
and Ervin is a good man working
under considerable pressure.
He's a hack.
You're not bothered
by the pressure, Deputy?
Not in the least.
I need you to make this
go away, Bill.
I won't forget,
believe me.
Another thing-- Slim Charles
got up with me.
Said the fat man
want a sitdown.
Nah. I did that already.
Well, Slim say the fat man knew
the card game was gonna get took.
He did, did he?
Set it up.
Why you always
be back here?
Quiet. And I can see
what comes.
But you out in the weather
and shit.
- I don't like to speak in no rooms.
- Yeah.
Yo, oh-oh,
you ain't staying long.
So you know,
I almost got that for you.
I just need
a couple of days more.
You can keep my money
for now.
- I got something that needs doing.
- Anything, Marlo-- your call.
Omar gonna come in your store,
stick it up, rob you.
You gonna call the police,
make a report. You feel me?
Yeah, that'll work, but, uh,
you know when he get out,
he's coming right at me,
I ain't scared or nothing.
- I'm just saying, you know?
- He ain't gonna get out.
A man make bail on robbery.
Make it no bail.
If you have a problem,
Iike you can't make it
to detention,
you need to tell me.
That's your responsibility.
People will be more than willing
to help you out,
but it's up to you to ask.
You can go back
to the cafeteria...
or hang up here.
Duquan,
could you come here?
I thought maybe you could help me out--
I packed too much.
Take this down
to the cafeteria
and get yourself something to drink
from the machine.
Thank you.
Crystal,
you got a second?
What's up with Duquan?
I gave him some new clothes.
I was expecting--
He might have lost them.
That fast?
It weren't that.
His people take his clothes,
sell it on the corners.
- You're kidding.
- No, sir.
Everybody knows.
Which brings me to
what we're proposing--
different kids,
different approaches.
You tell us who we need to touch
at North Avenue to get the go-ahead.
The "Puzzle Palace"?
Look, if y'all still wanna jump in
and help, I'm fine with it.
That's about all the okay
you need in my house.
The Stricker Street situation is
waiting in the office.
Neighborhood squabbles,
and my babies bring it in here.
Two fights yesterday-- all because
the mothers can't get along.
I gotta go.
Mrs. Donnelly will work out
the nuts and bolts.
But just so you hear it,
thank you.
It'll be the only time anyone
in this system will think to say it.
He's a good man.
You need to protect him.
- Protect him?
- Principal Withers
just went out on a limb for you,
and in this system they know
how to handle a chainsaw.
Excuse me?
Anyone has a problem
with what we're doing,
it's on him.
So you specified
eighth-graders?
We have 256 on roll.
241 attend
on a regular basis.
Of those, 40 or so would fit your bill
of corner kids.
40?
Pretty workable.
Ahem.
- What would you suggest?
- Start with 10 or so.
Ms. Sampson has enough
to get you going.
- One of them named Namond Brice?
- Pick of the litter.
But you'll have to wait.
He's on a three-day suspension.
Tilghman Middle School.
Can I help you?
Remember when I was a cadet,
I was up here on a cadaver search.
Instructor gets
on the radio to say,
"We're looking for
one body in particular.
If you go grabbing
everyone you see,
we'll be here all day," he says.
Leakin Park...
where West Baltimore
brings out its dead.
Not anymore,
from the look of things.
Not by the roadside,
anyway.
If he's dumping them here,
he's dumping them
deep in the woods.
Come on.
At each raid site,
we're anticipating dope
or cash or guns.
All warrants are
for prime locations
Iinked to high-level
violators.
Weeks-old addresses linked
to low-level corner boys.
We'll also be sweeping drug corners
at these locations.
Wagons will hold
in this location here.
Jump-off time--
1500 hours.
We take our position
10 minutes before the assault here.
The go is on my say-so.
Questions? Excellent.
We'll hold in the rec room
till it's time to stage.
Warrants are one thing,
but street sweeps on Marlo Stanfield's
crews? Are you guys serious?
Carv, you give these hoodleheads
too much credit.
Trust me on this, Boy Wonder.
Never mind this horseshit.
So what've they got you
doing for your man?
Who, the lieutenant?
No, Royce. Herc, the mayor's
your meal ticket.
He gets another four years,
you're liable to wear the gold braid.
Shouldn't you be out
waving a campaign sign or some shit?
And so ends the last crusade
of the Major Crimes Unit--
with a whimper.
Lester would cry to see his wiretap
cannibalized for that crap.
Street sweeps
on Marlo Stanfield?
- So what else you got cooking?
- Narcotics cases?
C.I.D. has the Burman indictment
coming in. Nothing past that.
As wars go, this drug thing
seems to rate less and less.
If Demper wins and manages
to forgive my trespasses,
maybe I'll go in and beg
for something new.
I don't know. Just feels like
enough's enough.
Crutchfield, line two, lntake.
- Sergeant, you were looking for me?
- I was, yeah.
Curly fry?
Chicken doohickey?
Sit down.
Norris is back
on the Braddock case.
It's by order
of the deputy ops.
In fact, we're gonna go
with a story that says
he was never off the case,
that you and he are partnered,
a task force of two,
working it together.
Fuck you, fat man.
Not original, but succinct.
I like your approach.
Y'all humiliate me once
by dropping me into this thing,
and now you're gonna shame me again
by bringing Norris back.
This is Homicide, Detective.
This is not some boiler room unit
where no one pays attention
to whatever the fuck it is
you call police work.
The bosses?
They know our names up here.
Now I didn't like it
when they came to me
and told me to dump Norris,
but dump him I did.
And it's not like I wanna
carry water for them
now that they're pretending
they never told me to do any such thing,
but carry the water I will.
And in the end,
when everyone else in this unit
is buried and beshitted,
this detective sergeant
will still be standing.
So get the story straight:
Norris was always
the primary,
and you are now assisting
on an investigation
which is progressing
even as we speak.
Does the colonel
know about this?
He's in the hospital--
chemo didn't work.
Press conference is upstairs
in half an hour.
- So don't be late.
- Press conference?
Mm-hmm.
I ain't mean
to laugh at you none.
I know it sound crazy,
but I ain't joking.
For real, Lex a zombie.
I knew it way before
what Na' and them was saying.
Listen,
they had me tell Lex to go up
to the playground.
I told him to go up there
and see some girl.
He ain't never come
back down.
So what they gonna do to me
when they get mad at me?
It makes sense Chris taking them
into the vacants--
to change them.
And you know what else?
That ain't
what he doing--
Chris in the vacants.
Changing them?
He ain't changing them,
he killing them.
That's all.
They're getting killed.
How you know?
Can't tell nobody.
I seen it.
I seen them walk
a boy up into one house
over there on Calhoun.
You seen that?
Yeah.
That's just false.
Detective Norris has been
working in this case nonstop.
And given her narcotics
expertise,
Detective Greggs
was assigned to augment
rather than to replace him.
But for two days sources
inside the department were saying--
I'm inside the department,
and I'm telling you that's not true.
We do not play politics
with a criminal investigation.
And how do you explain
Councilman Gray's allegations?
I think you should ask
Councilman Gray that question.
- Police! Search warrant!
- Take the back.
- On the ground, now!
- Police! Search warrant!
Two upstairs.
- Don't move!
- Check that backroom.
I said, get your ass
on the ground.
- Get down!
- Get down!
- This is the 1300 block, right?
- No, this is the 12.
Are we on the right corner?
- We had this as a stash house?
- According to the wiretap.
How long ago?
They move them around, you know.
- Zeroes on the warrants.
- Minor arrests
- on the designated corners, sir.
- They were tipped!
- You think?
- For us to come up this empty
at all these locations,
it has to be.
This cocksucker Marlo thinks
he's smarter than us?
He is not. Sergeant, I want
to know where he hangs.
You mean like him personally?
He moves around,
Lieutenant. He floats.
But I have seen him
in the concrete park behind Fulton.
- In a park?
- If the weather's right, he sits
out there in some lawn chairs,
holds court.
He's got people covering
every approach
so there's no creeping up on him. My
guess is that he likes to talk outdoors
so no one can drop
a microphone on him.
Sergeant, what can
we do with that?
I admit I've made
some mistakes,
Burrell being
one of the biggest.
But he's got a job
for about 10 more days.
After the primary,
he's gone, believe me.
And that last stunt--
pulling a detective.
- What'd you expect?
- Not that-- huh-uh.
Hey, I had nothing to do
with that nonsense.
Now, that's a straight-up lie. I was
at that damn meeting when you told him,
- "Slow the case down."
- I didn't mean--
Who the hell knows
what you mean anymore, Clarence?
Look at this.
Look at it!
You gave me
your word on this--
your word, Clarence.
But here you are ticketed up
with Eunetta in her best precincts
and then ticketed up
with my girl Daniels
where she's
running strong.
Odell, this is the first
I've seen this.
Come on, now! This is probably
Eunetta's people pulling this shit.
With a "Citizens for Royce"
authority line?
Eh, look at you, Clarence.
Just look at you.
You've forgotten your agenda.
You've forgotten your base.
You think a shave
and some Marcus Garvey posters
are gonna get you over?
Do you think that's gonna
make up for jumping in bed
with every damn
developer?
Shit. You're even
on Clay Davis's tit.
Now don't you go getting
all self-righteous with me, Odell.
Campaign runs on dollars--
you know it.
Whose dollars?! Those sons of bitches
you got around your card table
every month feeding your kitty?
Oh, yeah,
I know about that too.
You-- trouble with you--
fuck you, Clarence. I'm gonna
sit what's left of this one out.
- I'm gonna sit it out.
- Sit it out.
- The primary?
- Sit it out!
Odell!
Odell!
Who the hell do you
think you are, huh?
Come November, I'm still gonna be
the only game in town!
Odell, turn your back on me now,
I won't forget!
We can't afford this.
We need his organization on Tuesday.
- Go after him!
- Fuck that
holier-than-thou
motherfucker!
Delegate Watkins.
Delegate Watkins!
Wait, sir.
I-I'm sure we can
work this out.
You and the mayor
can talk this through.
Deputy Rawls, please.
It's Lieutenant Hoskins
at the Hall.
You're gonna use the hole
in the wall, right?
Yeah, I'm gonna rub some dogshit
on the front of this thing.
I don't want nobody
touching it.
Got it?
You need
to raise it a bit.
Yeah, that's good.
Right there, that works.
- Thought I heard something.
- Rats.
- How we doing?
- We need to go.
He ain't nothing
but a skanky-ass bitch to begin with.
And besides,
he ex-police.
So you know what that like.
I'm going to the ladies' room.
Bey, you need to talk to him.
Visiting hours
end in 30 minutes.
- Visiting hours...
- Yo, Daddy, don't even go there,
with you all the time telling me
how you dropped out in the sixth grade,
went up on the corner
with Avon and Stringer,
earned cheese for the family, saying
how it made you a man--
All right, all right.
You right.
Can't throw rocks.
But I'm just saying,
you know how your mother be,
with all the fussing.
Maybe you just need to slow it up.
You know what I'm saying?
Yo, you heard
how Marlo punked Bodie?
Said he either got to work for him
or give up his corner.
Don't you know?
His sorry ass buckled.
Oh-hh, you'd have gone
about it different?
Yeah, I'd have
stood tall, like you.
Got my nine--
fuck Chris and them.
Listen to you,
all spit and fire.
You'd have gone to the mattress
all by your lonesome
and went up against
half of the West side.
You got it where it counts,
and I respect that more than anything.
But shit out there now ain't like
it was when we was coming up.
Back in the day, a punk nigger
like Marlo steps out,
breaking the rules and shit, he find
himself in the back of a car trunk
on the way to Leakin Park.
No doubt.
We did that shit right.
Word was your bond.
Man looked out for his own,
knowing he in a family.
Dig where
I'm coming from?
But today
it's all fucked up.
These steps.
- Thank you, baby.
- You're good to go.
Say "Omar."
Omar.
Nothing?
We checked both sides
of the street
- from here up to Monroe.
- Nothing?
Nothing that don't
belong in no sewer.
Thanks.
Other ideas?
Whoo!
Blood, bump me off that nigger
up the "skreet."
Motherfucker
in the "Bruick"?
That be him.
I be saying,
no motherfucker gonna
run off with my "hairon."
Oh, this is
fucking great.
Get somebody who reads lips,
this motherfucker's history.
Is this legal-- I mean,
intercepting what they're saying?
Don't go Freamon on me.
Shit. I got to run.
Hey, man, what about some
fucking relief? I been here all morning!
You heard?
They making movies.
Yeah. How you
wanna play it?
I ain't sure.
Let's see the fat man.
How'd the other thing
turn out?
All good.
- Yo.
- What up, boy?
- If you want some, I got Reeses.
- Nah, man.
You trying to make
some real cheese? $5?
- What you need?
- Me and Paul gonna get it on with Tiff.
Keep an eye out. I don't want Mrs. D
creeping up. Feel me?
I feel you, but I got some sixth-graders
waiting on a special order.
Let them wait, man.
It ain't like we gonna be all day.
All right.
No, ma'am, it says right here--
His Honor had the Bureau of Solid Waste
conduct a clean sweep
along Tivoly.
But it took six months
before they showed up.
Well yeah, okay,
but nobody's perfect.
But hey, listen. I wouldn't be
sitting here if I didn't believe
Clarence Royce wasn't truly committed
to this city and its people.
What about the crime
in our neighborhood?
I admit that's another
good point.
But, lady,
between you and me, I can tell
from your voice you're black and
you can tell from my voice I'm white.
So I gotta ask you,
when do you think the last time
a white man voted for a black man
when there was another
white man in the race?
I don't know, but you must
really believe in him.
Well, ain't that what I been saying?
He's just the best candidate.
- So you'll go with my man?
- I'll think about it.
All right, that's great.
Thank you for your time.
- Goodbye.
- All right.
- I have a hall pass.
- Yeah, good for you.
- Mine's down.
- Attaboy.
You need bodies, Lester?
Here you go.
We got a warrant and a teletype
for my boy Lex.
So dead or alive, he's on file.
And beyond that,
it's time for you to shine
that mighty intellect of yours
on some real murders, hmm?
Give up the hypotheticals
and shit.
Yeah, I suppose.
This is my issue-- crime,
and I understand completely
what you're saying.
And if you give me the opportunity,
I will be able to do something to--
to help you out and, you know,
other people in this neighborhood.
Mr. Ricks,
thank you for your time
- and for your attention.
- No problem.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Pretty brazen, shaking hands
with the enemy in broad daylight.
- Werner's Deli this isn't.
- Definitely not.
Though here you are, Councilman,
leaving no door unopened.
Shoe leather--
our secret weapon.
You surprised me.
You've made this a horse race.
So uh, what makes me think you didn't
just happen by and find us here?
Watkins is breaking
with the mayor.
How do you know?
I know. I've carried the mayor's water
because I had to, Councilman.
I'd love to see some new blood
in this city.
And I'd love the chance
to do the right thing
for this police department
for a change.
Wait until he turns
the corner.
District office for Watkins--
Gilmore Street.
And fuck
them red lights, man.
Not a place you expect
to find any gangsters--
police, for that matter.
- Heard you knew something I didn't.
- Told you before--
I make it my business
to keep an ear to the ground.
I make it my business
to do business.
We doing business,
or are we just talking?
And if it's talk,
I'ma walk.
I heard the people pulling
security at the card game
weren't too keen
on their wages.
I figured it was
only a matter of time
before they found a way
to get their due compensation.
And you didn't think
to tell me?
A man learns best
when he get burned.
How do I know you ain't
making this shit up?
You don't.
Things happen on the street.
Proof is hard to come by.
Go ahead, open it.
Off the street,
there's all kind of proof.
They planning on executing
those Friday--
time it with the election,
I guess,
show they doing their job,
cleaning up the city,
taking down a kingpin.
- How did you come by this?
- Told you before--
I keep my ear
to the ground.
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Maybe nothing.
Charlie's not part
of the co-op.
Or maybe
I tip him for a fee.
What do you think a man
with a whole lot of money
would pay
for his freedom?
You know, lately
I come to find out someone trying
to take pictures of me.
Pictures?
Video.
You heard anything about me
through your travels?
Had no incentive to listen.
You do now.
It's one thing
to sit out the primary.
It's another
for me to turn
on Clarence Royce.
- Granted.
- And if I did jump,
why not land
behind Tony Gray?
At least he's from
my side of the tracks.
Tony can't win. I can.
Look, the truth is,
whatever I can do for you,
the mayor can match or double.
I have a pretty good
grass-roots organization,
but nothing even close
to his kind of money.
Now, I'll ticket up
with anyone you want me to.
I know you want Daniels in the 11th
and Stokes in the 10th.
I'll keep away from any tickets
you think I might harm.
I know I'm not everyone's idea
of a bargain on your side of town.
- Hmm.
- But right now,
a week from the primary,
the fact is,
Royce and I both need you.
After the election, the equation changes
for him but not for me.
I'm a white mayor
in a majority-black city,
and if I'm gonna
do anything--
and, Delegate, I am so serious
about fixing this city--
I'm gonna have to govern
by consensus.
And if you support me, you will have
a voice within my administration
simply because
I'm gonna need it.
Last poll that
Clarence showed me,
he was up
by seven points.
Bullshit.
I'm within four.
- You won't be needing that.
- I know.
- Here?
- Yeah, here.
Dag.
Yo, turn it off-- the bulb
might have got too hot.
Or the battery's dying.
We should go back.
- Yo, man, it stinks, man.
- Ain't like it was.
See he ain't move.
Yeah.
Blood still stuck to his hair.
- He dead?
- He dead.
Lex too?
He dead. They all is.
Feel better?
Donut wrong, yo.
Ain't no special dead.
There's just dead.
On this Sunday
before the primary
when we will go to the polls
to exercise our blessed franchise,
our lesson comes from
Exodus, chapter 18.
"And it came to pass
on the morrow
that Moses sat
to judge the people:
and the people stood by him
from the morning
unto the evening.
And Moses judged the people.
And he shouldered
this tremendous burden all alone.
And one day,
his father-in-law said to him,
'Moses, why do you carry this
awesome responsibility
by yourself?
You need other wise men
to help you rule
justly over the people.'
So Moses hearkened to the voice
of his father-in-law,
and chose able men
to rule over the people."
Can I preach it like I feel it?
Hey hey hey.
This Tuesday,
when we choose
the men and women
who will lead our city,
we would do well to keep
those standards in mind.
Men of truth,
who fear God
and hate covetousness.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Hey.
God bless you.
Good to see you.
How you doing?
- Just fine.
- How's Mama?
- Tell her I said hello.
- Fellowship committee at 2:00:
- If I'm late...
- We'll wait.
All right. Thank you for coming,
young man, young lady.
- Reverend.
- Councilman.
Mrs. Carcetti.
How are you?
Thank you so much
for having us.
- Thank you.
- lnteresting sermon.
Polls seem to think
you have a chance.
Well, we're within
the margin of error.
Margin of error.
That's an interesting phrase.
And I see you've got
Delegate Watkins working the crowd.
Well, I'm hoping
he's not going to be the only one.
I'll tell you what, Councilman.
I will keep an open mind
until I walk into that booth on Tuesday.
- And if you win--
- You're holding me to a high standard.
- Moses? I mean, Jesus, Reverend...
- Tommy.
I'm sorry. I can't believe I said that.
Moses will do for now.
We'll save Jesus
for your second term.
- Have a good one now.
- Thank you.
Thank you all
so much for coming.
- Signs o' life?
- Not even a lookout.
- Maybe they went to church.
- Our Lady of the Re-up.
He'll show up sooner or later.
- Call me.
- All right.
Vote for Carcetti.
Vote for Carcetti
on Tuesday.
Tommy Carcetti running
for mayor. Thanks.
- Hello, Councilman.
- Good morning.
I've been following
your campaign. I'm a teacher.
- Excellent.
- High-school biology.
- What? Here in the city?
- Baltimore County. I just wanted say
I think your position
on school-board reform
- is very encouraging.
- So you'd vote for me?
If I lived in the city,
I absolutely would.
- Good luck on Tuesday.
- Thank you.
They're all fucking county people.
We're almost
done here anyway.
- Thomas, look at this.
- What's that?
Check it out.
In your private practice,
you ever represent a Bobby Harrison?
The slumlord?
Fuck, no.
I don't remember ever
even meeting this guy.
"Carcetti got the most
serious charges dismissed
and the others reduced
to small fines.
The slumlord once again walked free
with a slap on the wrist
while hundreds of tenants
continue to suffer
substandard living conditions."
Last-minute smear.
They're running scared.
- Royce.
- Who else?
65% of the city rents.
Bobby Harrison's name
is dirt in this town.
Two days before the election
and they smear me?
Courthouse steps.
When the fuck was this taken?
- It's a fake. They photo-shopped me.
- We have time to prove that?
- We can try.
- Try, shit.
- I'm gonna lose behind this.
- Easy, Tommy.
We always figured they'd
pull some last-minute shit.
At least now we know
what it is.
Fuck.
I want you to remember,
you're representing your daddy.
Yeah, I know.
What she wanna
see us for, anyway?
Maybe she got somethin'
special in mind for you, boy.
- Cool.
- She's a Barksdale.
She know talent
when she sees it.
Besides, they owe
this family a lot.
Your daddy,
he stood tall for them.
I know, I know.
He a soldier.
- Like father, like son.
- No doubt.
- What time you got?
- 3:30.
Motherfucker late.
Yo.
It's for you, Marlo.
Yeah, speak.
You on it.
As long as she hit
her mark, we straight.
What time I gotta pick up
that skinny girl?
A'ight.
So what time they say?
Tomorrow night.
She be on the 8:45
from New York. Yeah.
We can take care of that.
No. I'll do it.
Don't want nothin'
to go wrong.
You sure about that?
It's a'ight.
You can hang back on this.
Yeah, I think I got
this one, too.
Marlo Stanfield.
He ain't so much.
Using cell phones and shit.
What's he sayin' now?
"What time I gotta
pick up the skinny girl?
I do it.
Don't want nothing
to go wrong."
Maybe he's picking up
a girlfriend?
"Skinny girl from New York"?
It's code. Cocaine.
Damn. For Marlo himself
to get near a package...
He's a mope. I told ya.
- So what do we do about it?
- We work up some counter lit.
That's why we have
a printer on retainer.
Best if we run down
the original photograph.
If we can prove
this one's a fake--
I didn't work at "Sun" Papers
for 22 damn years
not to know somebody.
I'm gonna call Paul McCardle
at the photo library.
And if we still
can't find it?
Then we put out
a fake photo of our own.
Show Royce in a motel
with a dead girl and a live boy.
We can't sling mud back.
Not this late.
Relax. I'm kidding.
You get back on your schedule.
Hit all your stops.
Go to that donors' dinner
tonight and make nice.
We'll take care of this.
You can't do this to us.
Bey took the weight
for all y'all.
And you've been
amply compensated.
- But time moves on.
- Not for Bey, it don't.
What I meant to say is there's
no more money coming in.
No more business.
Avon is gone.
So are his people.
Shit.
You seem to still be doin'
all right for yourself.
There's nothing more
I can do for you.
Bey know everything.
You forget that?
And what's he gonna do?
Who's he gonna tell?
And what do I care
if he does?
Bey never heard me say
a damn thing about business.
What about your brother?
Avon could be gone longer
if Bey gets to speakin' his mind.
I couldn't care less
about Avon.
The thing is I wanted
you both to hear it from me
so there ain't no lies
from here on in.
She even paid enough
over the last two years
that you should have enough
money going forward, son.
Your father has not been
disrespected here.
You both got
what was coming.
But ain't nothing
lasts forever.
Jailhouse snitch?
Called last overnight.
Worden talked to him.
Says for a deal,
he can give us the case.
- No shit.
- Gonna write up a writ,
send it over
to the State's Attorney's office,
get them to sign off on it
first thing tomorrow morning.
- What's the rush?
- We jump on this.
We cause a major shit stink
right before the election.
If this guy really knows
why the witness-- what's-his-name?
- Braddock.
- --was killed,
might be bad for the mayor.
If it's not bad
for the white boy, Carcetti.
You care, either way?
Fuck no. I don't give
a shit either way.
I don't even vote.
But it'll be fun to fuck
with them downtown suits.
Maybe get you on the 1 1 :00 news.
Get a little payback
for all that shit they put you through.
With only two days left
before the primary,
campaign officials
traded charges today
over a controversial
flier distributed
in some African-American
neighborhoods.
What seemed to be a secure lead
for the incumbent mayor
has evaporated in recent days.
The latest "Sun"-WQMD poll
shows the two men
in a virtual dead heat
with Councilman
Tony Gray trailing.
4% of the likely voters
are still undecided,
and with the prim--
I can't wait
for it to be over.
Yeah, me either.
Can that flier hurt you?
You know, we found
the original photo
in "The Sun"'s files.
They grafted my puss
onto some perp-walk shot
on the courthouse steps.
I'm standing where some
sheriff's deputy was.
Oh my God.
What a nasty business.
Royce is swearing
he had nothing to do with it.
Claims it must've been
somebody freelancing.
Well, Norman and Terri
say not to worry.
It's all in the game.
You know, when I was
15 points behind,
I was resigned,
you know?
A landslide,
I could live with that.
I mean, what else did
anyone expect, anyway?
White guy runnin'
for mayor in Baltimore?
But this:
Jen, if I lose this here
by two points, it's gonna kill me.
It's gonna just fucking kill me.
You gonna have to
step up now, Nay.
A'ight.
Be the man of the family.
You older than your daddy was
when he went out on the corner.
That's what I been sayin'.
Damn. He quit school.
You ain't quittin' school.
- Not yet.
- Ma.
But you are goin' out
on your own.
You gonna ask Bodie
for a package.
What if he say no?
I ain't take
no for an answer.
- Just did.
- What you mean?
- From Brianna.
- Hand me the damn phone.
What she say about you already
gettin' paid enough money?
She a lyin' bitch, Namond.
You see?
There's a lot about this world
you just don't know.
What it come down to is
she know you ain't gonna snitch.
- No matter what shit she pull.
- She got that right.
She takin' advantage of you, Bey.
She takin' advantage of you.
Sound like she got it all figured.
Bitch got it figured out, all right.
She cuttin' us loose
without notice. Nothin'.
Like comin' home,
findin' our shit in the street, Bey.
She don't give a fuck
about you, Avon, none of it.
She had the nerve
to talk to me on this,
Iike she gonna
set things straight
so I don't tell no lies.
Jen, I'm sorry.
He said he'd be up.
He's already gone
to the office.
Well, what's he doing there?
He couldn't sleep.
He's been there for hours.
Aw, shit. See ya.
And given that we still
have a shortage of officers
willing to work secondary
at the polling stations,
we're asking
for anyone interested
to contact Tactical
this afternoon.
Next order of business:
fresh warrants,
beginning with murder
and weapons charges
on one Omar Little.
Anyone know this mutt?
Oh, yeah!
- Who'd he kill?
- Some lady in a store.
- Reads like a taxpayer.
- A taxpayer?
From what this says,
he's charged with felony homicide,
to wit: murder in the commission
of a robbery.
About fuckin' time someone got
some paper on that motherfucker.
Anyhow, we got no fixed
address, no known abode.
But if apprehended,
contact Detectives Holley
and Crutchfield in Homicide.
You wanna find Omar Little?
You look for a corner boy
running away from a corner
with shit in his pants.
You ever know Omar
to do a citizen?
Anyway, pass these around.
- Jesus, Tommy.
- I spent a couple hours
going over the latest data,
rearranged the schedule.
Tommy.
A little bit of knowledge--
There's a bunch
of middle class black precincts
which are strong on Tony
but still have a high undecided.
I think we can
pick up some votes--
Those people hate the mayor.
You're gonna get those votes,
- and if you don't, Gray will.
- We go door to door today.
As long as they
don't go to Royce.
I need some black votes
if I'm gonna be mayor.
I need some kind of mandate
from that community.
If I sneak in with a bare plurality...
We might just win this thing.
What do you think
kept me up all night?
With all due respect
to your early-morning analysis,
we got three back-to-back
drive-time radio interviews
I wore out
my kneepads to get.
The people running your campaign
are professionals, Tommy.
Don't try this shit at home.
You know, there might
just be a job for you
in a Carcetti administration--
press secretary, chief of staff.
Oh, get in the fucking car.
Duquan:
Mr. Prez.
Can you come
with me, please?
What'd I do?
Get here early.
I'll let you in, and you can shower.
My dirty clothes?
Put 'em in this bag,
leave 'em in the locker.
I'll bring 'em home
and wash 'em.
Go ahead and get cleaned up.
You'll be late for class.
Hey, Paul.
Hey, Monnel.
Skanky ho.
Damn, she good, though.
Yeah yeah.
You right about that.
Hey, yo, Tiff, baby.
I got 50c too.
Fuck y'all.
Damn. All three at once?
You know she could.
I know you could.
- Sir.
- At ease.
Man, I hate it when the bosses
creep below the eighth floor.
Yeah, well, I need a moment
just to unclench my asshole.
- Sir?
- The Braddock investigation.
It's coming. Norris and Greggs
are wringing it out.
I fuckin' know it's coming.
Commissioner Burrell
had a visit first thing this morning
from State's Attorney
Demper himself,
asking why one day
before the primary
our detectives were trying
to writ out a jailhouse snitch.
The tip came when it did.
I didn't push it,
and I didn't hold it back either.
Let the chips fall
where they may.
Exactly, sir.
Sergeant?
Fuck your falling chips.
If Braddock was killed
because he was a witness
and we break the case
one day before the primary,
Royce hates us forever--
and Royce might win the election.
If Braddock was killed
for any other reason
and we break it today,
then Carcetti hates our guts--
and Carcetti could win.
I see your point.
Tactical tells me
we're still about 20 bodies short
for manning
the polling places.
I want you to detail
two detectives
to uniformed
election duty immediately.
Lemme guess:
Norris and Greggs.
Sounds good.
They're to report
to Tactical at 1 300 today
for election orientation.
They can pick up
their writ
and talk to their snitch
on Wednesday.
American democracy.
Let's show those
Third-World fucks how it's done.
Yes, sir.
I have what I think is
some very good news for all of you.
We're going
to be implementing
the University of Maryland
pilot program.
You're only taking
three of my knuckleheads?
A total of 10 children
from the eighth grade
in this first class--
eight boys and two girls.
- If things go well...
- It's a start.
- When?
- This morning.
Hallelujah.
Not a moment too soon.
- How was l?
- Good on Steiner.
Better on the A.M. talk shows.
I thought you handled that call
about the fliers well.
Fucking Royce.
If I lose because of this bullshit--
You lose, we can blame it
on 10 different things.
Same thing if you win.
Guess who I just
got off the phone with?
State Senator Davis.
He wants a meet.
Clay Davis? Why would I wanna get
into bed with that motherfucker?
He didn't actually
come out and say it,
but it sounds
like he's ready to follow Watkins
and jump the mayor's ship.
What's he want in return?
Shee-it. Same thing
he always wants.
At least 20k to his favorite
campaign committee is my guess.
Maybe even 30,
'cause you know Clay ain't cheap.
Well, I'm not promising him
anything policy-wise.
You think Clay Davis
gives a fuck about policy?
Naw, this is strictly
for services rendered.
He might be conning us--
taking the money,
then sitting on his hands.
Maybe. But then all
we have to lose is money.
Could be the extra little push
we need on the West Side.
Set it up.
I already did.
- lnvert the denominator--
- What invert mean?
The numerator
and the denominator switch places.
- Turn upside down.
- Why you do that?
Because it works.
That's the formula.
Excuse me,
Mr. Pryzbylewski.
Namond Brice, Darnell Tyson
and Zenobia Dawson.
Grab your things
and come with us, please.
- Ooh!
- Quiet, quiet.
Calm down, please.
- What'd we do? We in trouble?
- Just come with me.
Shit. It's the story of my life.
They ain't coming back.
Yo, Mr. Prezbo,
they gettin' arrested?
No...
Yo, Nay,
can I have your Xbox?
'Cause you ain't gonna
need it where you are.
What'd they do?
Markeith, Kwame
and Latonya.
Bring your things
and come with us.
Ooh!
Again?
You know I can't
publicly endorse you.
Not at this late hour.
Then what are
we talking about?
I lay back and not do
what I usually do on election day.
I see you all get a push
in the Seventh
and Ninth Districts, say,
and maybe that piece
of the 1 1th west of Freemont.
I split some
of my tickets for y'all.
I split my walkaround money.
You know,
the usual to-and-fro.
Politics is
a good thing, pardner.
That's a minority opinion.
Let's order.
I'm hungry enough to eat
the horse you rode in on.
If you don't mind,
we're a little busy
- for a sit-down lunch.
- Oh, no doubt.
Just leave enough
for the tab.
Naw, she crazy.
She says you were there.
I wasn't. Besides,
it wasn't even rape.
- She wanted to.
- How do you know? You weren't there.
I saw her go in with them.
Go in with who?
This is no time
to play, young man.
You are in very serious trouble.
Who did you see her go
in the boys' bathroom with?
Paul and Monnel.
Paul and Monnel?
And what were you doing?
- Lookout.
- So you were involved.
But I didn't even see
what happened.
You were standing guard.
No, listen,
Monnel gave me $5
and just told me to stand by the door
and holler if someone came.
This isn't even fair.
I didn't even do nothing.
You stood lookout
while two eighth-grade boys
raped an eighth-grade girl.
But she wanted to.
That's not what Tiffanie says.
There'll be an investigation.
You'll be suspended.
You could very well be expelled,
maybe even face criminal charges.
Mrs. Donnely, please don't.
Mrs. Donnely, please don't
call my foster mother.
I'll tell you everything
I know about this.
I know all about it already.
No, but I know
some other stuff,
Iike who been thieving
from the teachers' lounge,
or tagging gym lockers, or even...
- Miss Jeffries, please.
- Miss Donnelly, please...
This is Mrs. Donnelly
calling from Tilghman Middle.
Listen... I know...
remember, the boy who cut
Mr. Philmont's tires?
I know who did that.
I know about a murder.
I do.
We've identified certain students
we feel will benefit
from the special curriculum
and the smaller class size.
We've chosen 10 students
from the eighth grade
to participate in this program.
You get chose,
you got to go?
- That's right.
- What if you don't wanna?
It's mandatory.
We feel that this program
will benefit everyone.
You'll get the attention you need.
And we outta
everybody else' shit.
My bad.
I ain't mean to curse.
Yeah, but you're right, though.
This class get tore up,
it's only on y'all.
- So we get put outta class.
- This is a classroom, too.
And every one of you
has proven time and again
that you're not ready
for a regular classroom.
But this is a new program
that if you work it
is going to make you ready.
Ready for gen pop.
This is prison, yo.
And we in solitary an' shit.
- Word.
- Solitary.
That's good, son.
This is solitary.
This is the hole
up in here.
He's a good kid.
He really is.
And once you make that call,
his name's gonna be in the system.
What can I do?
He says he knows about a murder.
I have to notify police on this.
At least let me call
someone I trust.
That's him right there.
Stand by. You don't wanna
be in on the collar?
Nah. If you take it, he'll think
it's a straight interdiction,
and I get to surprise him
at the bail review.
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
Can I have your attention?
Now boarding at
gate letter D, track 4,
the southbound
8:45 Acela Express from New York,
making station stops
at BWl Rail Station
and Union Station, Washington.
Sister, help you
with your bag?
- No, thank you.
- Don't be afraid.
What should I be afraid?
Who are you?
Just walk you to the door.
My husband
is waiting outside.
Like to meet him.
I'll wait with you,
make sure you're safe.
That really
won't be necessary.
- Amtrak police, sir.
- Could you step over here please?
- What is this?
- Give me the bag.
What is going on?
I don't know this man.
Where are you taking me?
- What'd he say about it?
- Nothing much.
Drugs?
I didn't question him
too close.
A murder.
I should
take it downtown.
Who knows
what he really knows?
I just-- I don't want to see him
get chewed up by the system.
Let me try
to keep this close,
give it to someone with
a little bit of discretion.
Appreciate it.
- Carver.
- Carver?
Ellis has come a long way.
I think he'd be right for this.
Why do you care?
And what's this kid to you?
I don't know.
He's one of my students.
Sergeant.
Clean. Both of 'em.
Say what?
Nothing in that bag
but ladies clothes.
Nothing dirty
on either one of 'em.
Unless you got another idea,
we gotta cut 'em loose.
From what he says,
he was just a go-between.
He delivered a message.
He told the victim to be
at a certain place at a certain time.
Then how does he know:
He says everyone knows
what happened to Lex.
It's in the streets.
This other thing at the school.
I swear I didn't
do it, Miss Anna.
I didn't do it.
You'll see.
School's gonna look into that,
we're gonna look into this.
As long as Randy cooperates,
tells everybody the truth--
- But if word got out--
- Understand.
That's why he's gonna go to school,
keep his mouth shut,
his nose clean,
go about his business.
Child's shown such bad judgment
in both instances.
Agreed.
But from what I can tell,
he's not a bad kid.
Dennis:
Where you goin'
at so early?
Oh, I'm gonna go run,
and then I got lawn work later.
You comin' back, right?
What you mean
am I comin' back?
It's gonna be
like that, huh?
What do you mean?
Like what?
- Where to?
- Highlandtown.
Flush out yo' base,
little trooper.
- What up, Spider?
- Hey, shorty.
Thank you, but I know
how I'm voting.
I'm gonna
be late for work.
Miss Anna, is it okay
if I stand out here
while you go vote?
- Don't you go nowhere, boy.
- Yes, ma'am.
So, what up, man?
So, how much they payin' you for this?
They say like 40, but I gotta work
the whole day though.
Know what I mean:
Yo, Spider.
Yo, that was Spider, right?
- Yeah.
- Well, where'd he go?
No, thank you, man.
I can't vote.
Conviction? Felony?
Move on, man.
A'ight, man.
You see Spider again, you tell him
he need to come past my gym.
He ain't been round in weeks,
and we need to talk. A'ight?
A'ight.
- Where's the older kid?
- I don't know.
- Okay. You're hired.
Shove one of those
into every hand you can.
Thank you very much.
Why you ain't at school?
Ain't no school today.
- One them Jew holidays?
- Election.
- So what you gonna do?
- Dunno. Hang.
What'd I say
about steppin' up?
Brianna turn off the faucet.
We gotta make some rain.
I'm gonna get dressed.
We go see Bodie.
Kid, I got
something else for you.
Put one of these
in every door
between the expressway
and Winchester,
and from Freemont to Fulton.
You can do it by yourself
or you can get some friends,
but I'm gonna come past
this afternoon, make sure it's done.
Okay. One in
each door. Cool.
This is
for the day's work.
- Whoa.
That's your walk-around.
But don't you fail me.
Took forever.
What's all this, son?
Man said if I put
these fliers in doors, I can get paid.
I come right home after.
You right you will.
You ain't
in these streets no more.
No, ma'am.
Sounds like she mean it.
"11 :00 News," huh?
Shut up.
I'm on this shit detail
because you wanted
to stir the pot.
And tomorrow, if we bust open
the Braddock case,
nobody's gonna give a fuck.
Life is timing.
No shit, fucknuts.
Tommy Carcetti.
How you doing?
- He's a cute one.
- Thanks.
Hey, Tommy Carcetti.
Hope you're voting today.
I am.
Well, who's it gonna be?
Give me a hint. Come on.
Don't keep me
in suspense.
You don't have
to worry about me.
Appreciate it.
Tommy Carcetti,
running for mayor.
Nice to meet ya.
- How much longer?
- I think we can wrap this up.
We got a lot more
places to be today.
Tommy Carcetti.
I knew your dad.
First District Democratic Club.
- No kidding.
- Just wanted to say you got my vote.
- Thank you.
- They had their chance.
Look what shape
the city's in.
I'm hoping
to turn things around.
Anyway, thanks for your support.
I mean,
you expect politicians to steal.
- I don't, actually.
- It's part of the game. I understand.
But we took one dollar
outta every three, not two outta three,
Iike these moolies.
I mean, leave something
for the city, for Christ sake.
Am I right?
Best of luck, Councilman.
Moolies:
Sorry.
Election fliers:
Yeah, just run up,
stick 'em in mailboxes,
you know, screen doors,
whatever.
- What about the vacants?
- We ain't even got to do the vacants.
Shit. Some blocks
ain't nothing but.
That's what I'm saying.
This be easy money.
Don't wanna do it:
- I do it.
- Me too.
Yo, this shit'd
be easier if we had a car.
Dang, Donut. I'm in enough trouble
with Miss Anna as is.
So, what up, Mike?
You in?
All right, then.
I'll holla at you later, boy.
Look, Namond's been--
what's the word?
He been inconsistent.
You know sometimes he be doin' good,
then other times, he just--
We talked about that.
He gonna do better.
Ain't you?
Election day special,
two for two!
- I don't know.
- Oh, I do.
You gonna give this boy
his own package
or there gonna be some drama.
You want me to talk to Wee-Bey?
Maybe you wanna talk to him.
I give you his number.
He got a cellphone.
All that's not even necessary.
I got all the respect
in the world for Bey.
Then show some
for his family.
Make me proud, hear:
Damn, boy. Your mama's
what niggas call a dragon lady.
She don't blink.
Yeah, gimme some
insight, though.
- To what?
- Why you is what you is.
Yo. What up?
Where y'all goin'?
Hungry, man.
I need to eat.
Nah, come one.
Let's finish this.
Nah, yo.
This shit is boring.
- Fuck it.
- Listen, I ain't even gonna pay y'all
if you don't finish
the job, so...
You already
got the money?
Fool, if the motherfucker
paid you out already,
then why the hell
are we still here?
'Cause this is the job.
Shit, the man ain't got
nobody to blame but hisself.
It's his fault
for payin' up front.
Yo, you need to split
that money up or something
'cause time is a-wastin'.
Didn't even finish
the day's work.
Get me something
at least.
- Lake trout.
- Soda too?
- Yeah. Strawberry.
- A'ight. I got ya.
Hey. Where the crew at?
Randy got 'em all some job
handin' out election
fliers or whatever.
You ain't wanna do that?
Hell, no.
It's bullshit, man.
- I got a job too.
- Word?
Yeah, with Bodie.
I'm movin' the package.
You wanna go
in on it with me?
You sure?
We could work together.
Nah, man,
that's your thing.
Go do what you do.
Yeah, a'ight.
I'm gonna holler at you.
She a cute one,
ain't she?
Yeah, boy. You know
I love the women.
Hey, you seen Spider
around any?
I mean, he ain't been
'round the gym in like a month, man.
I leave messages,
he don't call.
I don't understand, man.
He was one
of my best welterweights.
Now, why would he just
quit like that?
Why don't you ask his moms?
Well, shit. I was locked up
a good while, right.
I mean
I ain't no angel.
Naw. You ain't that.
Thanks a lot, folks.
Good job. Keep it up.
We're almost home.
You're the best.
The best.
Heavy turnout all around.
Big lines on the West Side
might be bad for us.
- I dunno but--
- Shh.
We're out here
in West Baltimore,
- the heart of his political base.
- This is today?
This is live,
right now in Lafayette Square.
Clay Davis just said
his whole organization
was out going door-to-door
for Royce's ticket.
So much for laying back
on the mayor.
We paid $20,000
for this shit?
He probably went to Royce
and shook him down for another 30.
Motherfucker. Clay Davis
must know something we don't.
He knows just enough
to get paid twice.
Gotta blame ourselves
for payin' this thief up front.
Hey, it was
worth a shot.
Aides to the mayor have told me
privately that they are concerned...
Thanks, yo.
I'm-a get me a cold one.
Grab the wall.
Officer Walker.
I ain't gonna be
out here strapped.
Aw, you gonna
take that on a humble?
Boy, you don't know there's
rules to this here game.
- Rules?
- Yeah.
Ugh!
Where your shotgun at,
Mr. Omar?
What is wrong with y'all, man?
Y'all ain't got no charges here.
Charge is murder, motherfucker.
Murder: Who I kill:
Hey, Omar.
- McNulty. What the hell goin' on here?
- You tell me.
We got a warrant
for a robbery murder. In a store.
Wagon's here.
Hey, yo, McNulty,
I need a phone, yo.
Fuck your phone.
If I'm going to Booking,
I need to make a call tonight, yo.
410-958-6612.
An' let it ring.
Here.
- Hey.
- Yo, Butchie. I'm locked up, yo.
What you need?
I got your bail.
Nah, no bail.
They sayin' it's murder.
Murder?
Well, don't worry. I got ya.
You some
kinda Democrat or what?
Voter turnout was heavy
all day across the city
with some precincts
reporting lines
as soon as the polls opened
at 7:00 this morning.
Election officials, however,
reported few problems
throughout the day.
Now the polls have closed,
officials at the Board
of Elections downtown
have begun the tedious process
of tallying the vote,
prepared for what could be
a long night.
With just over half of the city's
316 precincts reporting,
Councilman Thomas J. Carcetti
has a narrow lead of 2%.
Traditionally, those precincts
that report latest
tend to be
from West Baltimore,
which is expected to favor
Mayor Royce in the late going.
- How it go?
- Good. Nothin' to it.
I'm countin' on you, Nay.
Exit polls done earlier
in the day in key precincts
show voters divided
over the challenges facing this city,
such as crime
and education.
...be quite an election.
Since this race tightened
in the last couple of weeks,
I've been saying
that this election
would be won on the ground.
And whoever has the best
field operations will take it.
It's all about the turnout,
and this is something--
What about Bond?
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Yeah.
All right.
Talk to you in a few.
Bond's running really strong
against Demper.
Looks like we might have
a new State's Attorney.
What does that
mean for you?
Well, Demper's Royce's boy.
Dare to get
your hopes up, Tommy.
You know what? Let's get
outta here for awhile,
take a walk.
I'll get your ass.
- Pretty.
- A little ripe.
Well, can't do anything about
the way the harbor smells.
People are gonna
expect you to.
I guess.
You sound confident.
I have a feeling.
Could be a great city again.
Pull some jobs in here.
People move back,
fix up the houses.
It's ringing again.
Terri.
Maybe you should answer it.
I don't need an update
every five minutes.
- No, we should go anyway.
- Do we have to?
I'm sure they're frantic.
They don't know where you are.
Yeah?
Taking a walk with my wife.
On our way.
Royce is conceding.
The West Side
precincts came in
and we pulled two
outta five votes in some precincts.
We stole his base.
We won.
Are we happy about that?
I think so.
I think we are.
Yeah.
You sure?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Please.
I want to thank you all
for your hard work and dedication.
Give yourselves
a hand. Come on.
I just got off the phone
with Mayor Royce and Councilman Gray.
They were very gracious.
I asked for their help.
I mean, we still have
a general election to win.
Is there
a Republican candidate
for mayor in Baltimore?
I don't know. I'm not sure.
But, assuming that we win,
we still have--
we still have a lot of work
to do to turn this city around,
and we need everyone--
everyone who's willing to join us
in making a better Baltimore
for our children.
I don't want to make
a long speech. Believe me.
You don't want to hear it.
I don't want to make
a long speech,
so I'll thank each
of you individually.
But for tonight,
let's celebrate.
Tommy! Tommy!
How you doin'?
Thanks. Hey.
Damond.
I look forward to working
with you, Mr. Mayor.
Likewise.
And congratulations to you, too.
- Thank you.
- I'm going home.
No, come on. Stay.
I won't be long.
Yeah, you will.
It's your night.
Tommy. Tommy.
Look what washed up
on the beach.
Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.
Just came by to wish you well.
Looking forward
to working with you.
Shouldn't you be dead to me?
Sheee-it. I took it
easy on you, son.
I coulda had you
for twice as much.
You got off cheap.
He's right.
Butchie sent us.
What you in for?
I'm here on a 22-55.
I talked back.
- Moolie:
- Moolie.
He said that
in front of you?
He made a point of it, in fact.
You're the one said
I oughta shore up my base.
You didn't call him on it?
The ironies of democracy.
A vote's a vote.
And I never throw one back.
Speaking of ballots,
did you vote for me, Norman?
The sanctity
of the voting booth
is a cornerstone
of American democracy.
I gotta go.
You need a ride?
- Yeah.
- Come here. You're the best.
Thanks, Norman.
- Yeah, take a break.
- You got it.
One day.
Two days.
Come here, you.
- Be good.
- I'm gonna call you.
I have
a feeling you might.
Good night.
Ooh, I should go, too.
One for the road?
Sure. Scotch okay?
Sure.
You know, I gotta admit,
it feels good.
You deserve it.
You worked hard.
I did. I do.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
You know, when I took this job,
you promised me a win bonus.
Well, you earned it.
I can't do this.
Not now.
Oh, come on, Tommy.
You haven't changed.
Hell, from what
Norman tells me,
you nearly fell off
the campaign trail for a blonde
at the Stonewall dinner
two months ago.
He had to drag you
out of the bar.
It's not that
I don't want to--
Oh, you're feeling
a bit mayoral. Right.
You're onstage now.
Well, Tommy...
four years is a long time
for a fellow like you.
This could be
your last chance for a while.
You sure?
Maybe you have
learned something.
Write me a check.
They got
Honey Nut Cheerios in here?
Shit.
Yo, back the fuck up,
motherfucker!
My man here
saved my spot, yo.
It's a shame we don't have
more time together.
We could have made us
a couple of babies.
Ain't nobody see shit.
- How's that for a message?
- Not bad.
Except the price
on your head ain't for four figures--
- it's for five.
- Shit. For that kind of money,
I should have done you
my own self.
So who's doing
the bounty?
Who it is: A West Side player
by the name of Marlo.
Marlo? Can't say
I know the man.
- He know you.
- Can you get me a phone call?
I can do you one
better than that.
Who you calling?
- Police.
- The police?
Man owe me a favor.
...crime, violence, drugs,
drug addiction,
failing schools--
all of these social problems
in Baltimore City
over and over again.
And on June 8th,
when I had to write
a column for the next day,
some statistics had just come out
from the FBl showing
an uptick in some
of Baltimore's crime.
And we also had
a spate of five killings
in a two-
or three-day period.
And, you know, the idea
of sitting down again
and writing another column
on this subject--
I don't know
if it is important.
But here I am
a citizen of Baltimore,
and I take my citizenship as seriously
as I take my credentials as a columnist.
I said, "What am I gonna say?
What can I say about this?"
If the killings continue--
between 250 and 300
homicides a year...
- Top of the world.
- Top of the world.
I knocked off an incumbent major, Tony.
That ain't easy.
National party has to
take note of this.
Young and pretty as you are,
I'm sure they've got ideas.
All you have to do now
is run the city.
Tony, I've got to ask
you something:
Why didn't you run again
after the first term?
I mean, nobody had the--
the name you had, the organization.
Let me tell you
a story, Tommy.
The first day I became mayor,
they sit me down at the desk--
big chair and dark wood,
Iots of beautiful things.
I'm thinking,
"How much better can it get?"
There's a knock at the door
in the corner of the room,
and Pete comes walking in
carrying this gorgeous
Sévres silver bowl,
hand chased.
It was this big.
"It's from the unions,"
he says.
So I think
it's a present,
something to commemorate
my first day as mayor.
And he walks over,
puts it on a desk.
I look down at it.
It's disgusting.
I said, "What the hell is this?"
He said,
"What the hell's it look like?"
I said,
"lt looks like shit.
Well, what do you want me
to do with it?"
He says, "Eat it."
"Eat it?"
He says, "Yeah.
You're the mayor.
You've got to eat it."
So, okay.
It was my first day,
and Pete knows more than I do.
So I go at it.
And just when I finish,
there's a knock on the door.
And in walks Pete carrying
another silver bowl,
and this one's
from the blacks.
"This too?"
And he nods. I start eating.
And when I'm finished,
there's another knock
and another bowl.
This one's
from the Polacks.
Then after that,
one from the ministers.
And you know what, Tommy?
That's what it is.
You're sitting, eating shit
all day long, day after day,
year after year.
When I realized that,
I decided being
a downtown lawyer
and seeing my family
every night made for a fine life.
Just a fine life.
Got that dark horse
right here, man.
O.G. dark horse.
Man, everyone knows
his nigga ain't about to cop, is he?
Spider, Spider,
hold on now.
Come on, man.
Why you ain't come past
my gym no more?
I been waiting on you
for weeks now.
Talk to me, son.
You ain't my fuckin' father.
What happened between
me and your mom
ain't got shit to do with you
taking advantage of the gym.
Now, man, I'm just saying
you one of my best, boy.
Hell, if I thought it
was gonna hurt you, I wouldn't--
Fuck you! Ain't nobody
gonna hurt me.
Fuck you. So step up
and step off, unc.
I got customers
backing up.
Dark horse,
dark horse.
Five, and five more.
Shit. That's what that does.
Principal Withers,
please to the cafeteria.
Yo, last card down.
Remember?
Oh yeah.
My bad.
Hey, guys.
You know I don't mind you
coming up here most days
to eat lunch, but I said
you can't be gambling.
Yo, Mr. Prezbo, the quarter's
only a, you know, reminder
to remind me
that I got 25 shells.
That's all. Come on,
let's see what you've got.
Dang. Flush.
- But it don't beat your three nines.
- Yeah, it do.
- It do?
- It do.
It does.
Karim, you should have been more
cautious with your bet. Figure the odds.
Yo, it's our lunch break.
Don't be schooling us now.
Hold on.
Let him talk.
Well, for starters,
you have to get a count on the diamonds.
You know how many diamonds
there are in a deck?
13.
13-- that's right. Cards is
all about knowing the numbers.
With the numbers,
you can calculate the odds.
Now, Michael had
four diamonds showing.
Hold on. Wait.
What about dice?
I mean, does dice
have odds too?
'Cause mostly
that's what we play.
- Dice?
- Yeah. Sure.
So, can you show us
the odds of dice?
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah, man. Teach us dice.
- That'd be hard, man.
- For real.
Here comes that
Jailhouse Rick.
The Braddock case?
I take it we now have permission
to solve this fucking case,
seeing as everyone's
finished voting.
Solve away,
you bold centurions.
You don't have
work to do?
Not till I catch
a fresh call, no.
How much can you
sell that one for?
Mint condition, 300.
Fuck me.
I need a hobby.
That's right,
but he bucked on me.
I just thought he might have
come back past once or twice.
Sherrod's on a truant list,
Mr. Cousins.
He hasn't been back since
the last time you brought him in.
Well, if he does
come back past,
can you tell him
I'm looking for him at home,
and he can come
home if he want?
I apologize
for taking your time.
I see you up here undercover.
All right.
Don't worry, dawg.
I'll keep it close.
Mrs. Donnelly?
Does the school have
any kind of collection
of board games--
Parcheesi,
Trouble, Monopoly?
You're still teaching
eighth-grade math, right?
Trying. Yeah.
The book room downstairs.
Stay on the curriculum,
Mr. Pryzbylewski,
or you'll have an area superintendent
on our backs.
Remember this, yo?
Not in my case.
Them boys working the case
ain't really in the mood to listen.
As you can see, I still got
the lady-lawyer marker,
and if I recall, a police gun
got fired a while back.
Only reason I'm even here
is because of that gun.
As far as llene Nathan goes,
she promised a get-out-of-jail-free
on a small felony or two.
This here is a taxpayer murder
with an eyeball witness.
The eyeball witness
is lying, yo. Come on now.
When have you ever known me
to put my gun on anybody
- that wasn't in the gang?
- Oh. Omar.
Old Face Andre is
lying on me here.
The store owner--
now why would he lie?
- Andre working a package out the store.
- Ah.
Folk like that, they tend to bear
a certain resentment
toward folk like me.
If you didn't do this,
when you did others--
shit, I got files
on two open doubles last year.
Shotgun shells
at both scenes.
- What about that stash-house gunfight?
- Hmm?
What about Stringer Bell
and his muscle dead in the warehouse?
If this one ain't on you,
another dozen probably are.
And if this one
goes to court,
you can tell that jury
how wrong it is.
Obviously, a guy's alone
before I swear to them on the stand.
You leave me at courtside
and I'm done.
- You know that.
- Yeah?
So you ain't
making friends.
I got a bounty
on my head, man--
five figures.
If I would have known I'd be
sharing quarters with all these boys,
I probably wouldn't
have robbed so many of them.
Aw yeah,
that golden rule.
Well, since you
feeling all Biblical
and righteous and all,
you think on this:
Now if Omar ain't killed
that delivery lady, somebody else did.
But you giving him a free walk
right now, though, ain't you?
A man got
to have a code.
What's up?
Just the dice.
Grab the dice
from any game that has them.
We're using
that third edition, right?
- I don't know.
- We're using the third.
What are the new
fifth editions doing
sitting down here in a box?
No way.
Big red, y'all.
Big reds over here.
What's up, man?
Got your big yellow.
What's up?
Big yellow for you.
Look at you,
all business and shit.
Big yellow bird.
Yo, who you bumping with?
Ain't no bump.
They got their corner,
I got mine.
Ain't no thing.
You going up
the gym today?
I might see you later.
Big yellow.
Big yellow birds over here.
- Well, maybe they with Marlo.
- Ain't with no one.
They're just young'uns
playing in this shit.
So what you want to do?
Don't want to mix here
and bring the police to our shop.
When they step off,
you follow.
- Bank 'em good.
- What if they strut?
Yellow, big yellow.
Ain't no need
to pop no one,
but they need a warning.
Make sure they know
we for real.
Brokeback, man.
Brokeback right here.
Fresh from the street.
Brokeback.
Brokeback.
Brokeback.
Big yellow bird.
Tried to bring out
who was on me.
Led him
to the train station.
How that work?
Had the railroad police on me.
Couldn't smoke.
Guy was pulling the strings.
You need a name.
You get that,
I can run it down for you.
I'll get a name.
Camera still there?
Steal that motherfucker.
No one speaks to it,
then it's the feds
sniffing you out.
It's only federals who'd be
rich enough to lose a camera
and not go
to crying about it.
You steal that bitch
and someone comes knocking,
it's local.
Steal that bitch.
See what comes.
Hey, you know the boy used to be
with me running these carts,
go by the name
of Sherrod?
I'm looking for him.
I've got some good news.
So if you spot him,
you know, tell him to come see me.
That's $9 for two,
$10 for three.
That's $10 even too.
That's a good product.
Ain't none
of that alley shit.
People walking in front
of the camera waving-- waving hello.
Them Chinese made that shit.
- Yeah.
- No?
Hey, bro.
Much obliged.
It's a good deal,
good deal.
Hey, remember
to holler at my boy if you see him.
All right.
All right, here we go!
Bubbles' Depot
for my people.
Bubbles'll take care
of your troubles.
Ain't no trouble yet.
All right.
All right.
Take it easy, okay?
I know you remember me.
All right,
be cool with it.
Give it up, nigga--
that's what I'm gonna say to you
every time we meet.
Money or pills,
don't care which.
All right,
all right. Cool.
I'm getting it.
See?
Back down, yo.
He's in a hole.
Motherfucker
bad for business, man.
Y'all don't take care of
your neighborhood store?
What's up?
Officer.
How you doing, Officer?
Can you help me out please?
I just got robbed.
Thank you, man.
They all saw it.
Everybody was here
witnessing everything.
Took your money?
Yeah, man.
Same guy every day.
He went down the alley
towards Payson Street.
You can cut him off
on Lafayette--
You can't sell on the street
without a license.
And these movies--
it's copyright infringement.
- Come on, man.
- That's a hefty fine.
That's my 10--
Are you gonna rob me too?
That's what
you're gonna do?
You rob me also?
Baltimore's finest right here.
Thank you.
Everybody gather up,
all right?
Everybody take five
and gather up.
Mike, get in here too.
I want everybody that uses
the gym to hear this now.
Most of y'all know I came home
after being in a long time.
And some of y'all-- shit,
all of y'all probably
seen me welcoming the attentions
of some of the ladies
who've come past.
Easy.
Now, I realize that some
of these ladies is your relations.
I ain't mean
to disrespect y'all
or have any feelings hurt.
All y'all come in here
to learn a sport
and better yourselves.
Ain't no need for me
to get in the way of that.
All right.
And if your witness is in the game,
and Omar jacked him up good--
- What the fuck is this?
- Hey, Crutch, I'm just asking.
Is he kin
to you or what?
Vernon, man, you ran the sheet
on that Old Face, right?
Yeah. He was an asshole.
So what?
So what?
What's the history?
Do we come behind your casework
talking this kind of shit?
- Aw.
- Do we?
- Come on.
- No. Fuck you, Bunk.
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.
Soon as he comes out the gym,
yo, bank his ass, man.
Make sure
that nigga's shook.
You thought
I wouldn't handle it.
Some of us are in need
of some reproof.
I don't know about
all this beefin', man.
What, you scared, nigga?
We need to pump
your ass up some more.
Game on.
You coming round
the way tomorrow?
I think you should
stay off that spot.
Bitch, I'm talking to you!
Man, fuck you.
Fuck!
Mouthing don't
work for you, nigga.
Whoa whoa whoa.
Y'all have got to take this shit
out of the front of my door.
Namond, go inside.
Man, fuck you!
Yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah.
Hey, I feel you, man.
Ain't no beef here, though,
all right?
Go inside, man.
Yo, what happened
to your boy?
What the fuck
happened to you?
Ain't nothing.
You need to see how
the other nigga look.
- Who was that?
- Ain't nothing.
I can handle that fool.
- You ain't have to step too.
- Aw shit, no!
You had everything under control.
Look at your face!
Course, I recognize the other boy
was high as all hell.
And anything can jump off
when it's like that, you know.
Yeah, and he'd have been
on his ass if you ain't mixed in.
What's going on?
He into something?
Ain't none of my business.
Yours either.
Seriously, you guys ran
a hell of a campaign--
no let-up,
a lot of heart.
- I'll second that.
- Yeah. I liked the shit
when you trotted out
that witness story during the debate.
What about the fucking
last-minute fliers
and me and the slum lord
doing a tango
on the courthouse steps?
Wait.
Parker, who was behind that?
I didn't see
no Royce authority line.
Well?
Tommy, enough of
the bullshit, hmm?
What the hell
are we waiting for?
Bring your ass around here
and try out the big chair.
Come on.
Come on around here.
I'm not even Mayor-Elect.
General election's still
a few weeks away.
You don't beat Crawford
in a city where we outnumber
Republicans nine to one,
you don't deserve the fucking job.
Now, get on around here.
If I lose the general election,
I'll just blame Norman here.
He's taking over
from Terri D'Agostino.
She did good for you.
Yeah, she did.
The national noticed.
She's back at D.C.C.C. Iooking
to target red-state delegations.
After what she pulled off,
I hope she got a win bonus.
Hell, yeah.
They gave her my share too.
Wouldn't you know it?
Tommy, whatever you need
going forward
for the general election,
for the transition--
I want to hit
the ground running,
so I'm gonna need
to learn the agencies,
the budgets,
the problems-- all of it.
Wherever you want to go,
whatever you want to look at.
- See to it.
- Mm-hmm.
It's a hell
of a goddamn job.
Halfway glad to get out.
I'm gonna miss it.
Braddock case
running you in circles?
Whole day was
a waste of time.
Why not talk
to Wardell himself?
Ask him if he killed
the witness against him.
If he read the newspapers,
he already knows he's a suspect.
Will he take a polygraph?
Call his lawyer.
Tell him they're about to shift the
narcotics case over to the federal court
because a state witness
was murdered.
Tell him if his client
doesn't cooperate,
he's looking at mandatory minimums
and no parole.
The feds don't want
drug cases anymore,
especially not a case that's gonna
fall apart without a key witness.
Bluff. What have you
got to lose?
Maybe he blows the box.
Maybe he passes.
But he talks a bit
either way,
and you, Detective,
get to listen.
The fuck am l
looking at here?
Birds... I think.
You see that there?
I think that's a wing flapping.
Shit. Fuck!
Fuck it anyway, man!
Mr. Bond?
Hey. Call me Rupert.
Thanks for coming over.
Try to get
a running start,
meeting with
my unit chiefs.
No problem.
Congratulations
on the election result.
You'll be coming in
with quite a mandate.
Maybe so.
So, how can I help you
with the transition?
There's not a lot of high-end
narcotics cases in the pipeline,
- and major crimes--
- We'll cut it for political reasons.
Once the polls put me
up there with Demper,
people started
whispering in my ear.
And I also heard
about your subpoenas--
Andy Krawczyk,
Clay Davis.
Sir, I didn't intend--
To go after a couple
of Royce's money men four weeks
before a primary election?
Yeah. I think you're
wasted in narcotics.
Let me guess--
- How about V.C.U. as Unit Chief?
- What?
Violent Crimes Unit.
How about you
take that over for me?
Carcetti ran on a platform
of dropping the murder rate,
so V.C.U. is where the sparks
are gonna fly, right?
You're putting me in charge
of all homicide prosecutions?
What about llene Nathan?
She's moving up
to Second Deputy.
I came in here ready to get bounced
down to misdemeanors or worse.
Why would you think that?
The subpoenas
and the fact that Demper--
Demper lost the election.
I won.
And I admire your courage,
if not your loyalty.
Lester.
Excuse me?
Forgive me.
V.C.U. is great.
I'm more than ready to work
murders for you, Mr. Bond.
Good.
Rupert.
But now she's told police
sex was consentual
on Paul and Monnel only. So...
- So, Randy--
- He'll be back tomorrow.
- And the thing with the police?
- It's out of my hands.
Turn it down, ladies.
Quanice, lose the gum.
Okay. Settle down.
Mr. Prezbo!
What's he doing
with a computer?
We're gonna have a computer
in the class for special projects,
and another thing--
Dang!
They all new and shit.
Leave the old ones
on your desks,
and put your names
on the box
on the inside cover
of the new ones.
Okay. Did anyone have any trouble
with the homework?
- Charlene?
- I didn't get it.
- Didn't get what?
- None of it.
Michael?
That's great.
Good job.
Come on, eh?
Calvin, is this your work?
'Cause it looks
like someone else's.
No, I did my work.
Okay. Next time,
try to remember
not to copy Quanice's
name at the top.
All right. Did everybody
get a new textbook?
Yes.
Great. Okay.
Well, for now at least,
you can get those out of sight.
- Whoa!
- That's right!
Namond, why aren't
you in uniform?
Why did you decide
not to wear it?
I ain't in my right class,
so ain't no need for a uniform.
Interesting.
Why you always write down
everything we say?
Trying to get
inside our heads or something?
You trying
to get into mine?
Chandra, do you think this is
a beauty salon or a classroom?
Darnell, why didn't
you wear your uniform?
I meant to. I did.
Yeah, but after
a quart of vodka,
it'd be hard to know
what color shirt
you're supposed
to be wearing.
And you find
that funny, Namond?
Man, fuck you.
Darnell has a drinking problem,
and Namond, we believe,
suffers from
conduct-disorder issues.
- Do you need a time-out?
- Fuck you.
Yeah, he's got
a mouth on him.
Chandra, is it necessary
to comb your hair in class?
Fuck you,
cheese-faced bitch!
- I should tell you--
- You ain't tellin' nobody nothing!
Yeah. You know,
I was wondering
why she was in the class.
She seemed so--
Chandra, listen to me.
Oppositional defiant personality.
Get the fuck out
of my face, bitch!
I'm sorry
you're having a bad day,
but you're gonna have to
take a little walk with Miss Mason.
Come back when you've
pulled it all back together again.
Damn. It's bye-bye time
for my girl Chandra.
Yeah, you think?
Then to reiterate, this is
a polygraph examination--
non-admissible,
and the answers to all questions
are regarded as a proffer
- with a limited grant of immunity.
- Agreed.
Okay. To begin, please answer yes
to a series of questions
regardless of whether or not
that answer is correct.
Is your name
Anthony Wardell?
Yeah.
And you're from
Baltimore, Maryland?
Right now I'm over at City Jail,
but I'm from East Side.
So your answer is?
Yeah, I'm from Baltimore.
Are you female?
Fuck is wrong with--
my bad.
Yeah, I'm a bitch.
- Hey, sweet thing.
- Chandra.
We're working
on our short essay.
If you--
Diamonds are
a girl's best friend.
Need to get down
to lay down.
Namond, if you don't stop,
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave class.
See you sad-ass motherfuckers
in about three days--
You're leaving class,
not school.
What?
What about now,
bitch? Huh?
Huh?
That's not necessary,
Namond.
Oh, you gonna
suspend me?
We're gonna have
a little talk.
Man, fuck y'all.
I know the rules.
You've got to suspend me.
School's got to have rules.
He's right.
You've got to have rules.
Can't just be throwing
that shit out.
The point is:
I can call it like you want.
You want him to pass?
He passed.
You want him to come up inconclusive,
he's inconclusive.
What the fuck
kind of science is that?
Come on.
Did he blow the box or not?
I'm here for you,
Detective.
You know what we use
the polygraph for?
Leverage.
To get him in here
and fuck with him.
No wonder
this shit's inadmissible.
Let me guess.
They're out in the hall
and Swatowski is telling them
that he can make it go
any way they want.
If you think that's how we play it,
then why let your client--
Because you know
there's not much case left
now that
your witness is dead.
I don't need to expose him
to a federal charge if I can avoid it.
And because even if
Swatowski bends it for our ears,
he's let you know that
Mr. Wardell here did not blow the box.
Yo, I wouldn't kill me.
Even if it flips on me,
I ain't gonna do shit to the man.
Why not?
My moms and his--
they're, like, cousins.
Came up together
in the Latrobe, you know?
I've been knowing him since,
like, Head Start and shit.
But he was gonna testify.
What am I looking at on the first
conviction on this kind of waive?
Seven, eight?
Shit, I'll be out in three and a half.
You think I'm gonna kill my mom's
cousin's boy for three and a half?
I know that man helped
get himself elected
claiming that
I did me like that, but please.
Bum-ass motherfucker was
gonna testify against me,
and I swear to God
I feel bad he's dead.
I do.
Hey, llene,
I've been looking all over for you.
Omar Little.
From Bird's trial
a couple of years ago.
- The stickup boy.
- Mm-hmm.
He's in City Jail
on a felony murder.
Store robbery,
West Side.
When I gave him the card, I told him
it was for a light felony at best.
Yeah, of course,
but he needs to get writ out of B.C.D.C.
and put in protective
custody somewhere else.
He's sharing his address
with about 800 other guys
who have seen the business end
of his shotgun.
- Why do you care?
- I'm pretty sure he's being set up.
Really? How does that play with
the rest of the guys in the squad room?
Look, all I'm asking
is that you move him
to some county detention center
at least until I have a chance
to work back up on this thing.
Now, this card
ought to buy him that much.
Is Hartford County
Detention Center quiet enough?
- Yeah.
- Go pick up a writ in my office
and tell Mr. Little my debt's paid.
The fact is that homicides are
off 14% in the West Side this year.
But I'm not gonna stand here
and take credit for that
when all other U.C.R.
felonies are up.
- Why not, Major?
- A wise man once told me years ago
when I wasn't
even a sergeant
that you should never take credit
when the crime rate drops
unless you want
to take the blame when it rises.
Atten-hut.
Mayor-Elect is on deck.
Please, back to what
you're doing.
I'm just a councilman
here to observe.
At ease, gentlemen.
Major Daniels,
continue your presentation.
In any event, rather than allow
my post cars to patrol,
I put two-man cars
in the post
with the worst drug corners:
Edmonson Avenue, Poplar Grove,
Fayette and Baltimore Streets,
North Avenue.
Now, if nothing else,
a two-man car is more aggressive,
and that helps push it away
from the most volatile corners,
- which may be having an effect.
- Just pushing it?
I'm not devoting my resources
to cheap street arrests,
Commissioner.
Instead, I'm trying
to bring every officer I can
to bear on making
quality felony cases.
I could do more
but, well, it's my opinion
that not enough of the troops
I have are sufficiently trained
to properly
investigate such cases.
Major, you just
insulted your command.
Respectfully, sir, too many
of my people have spent years
chasing street-level arrests
while they grab bodies and make stats.
But that doesn't teach you
how to write a proper warrant
or testify properly
as to probable cause
or use, and not get used
by an informant.
I wish it were otherwise.
But if I'm chasing
felony cases,
I can only bring a minority
of my officers to bear.
- You've got all of it already!
- That's right.
Make a nigga work.
You like that shit.
Ain't that right, motherfucker?
You can't hide, son.
Don't care where it is.
In a nigga's ass crack,
I'll still find you.
Damn. Fucked that man up.
- Yeah, boy.
- All right.
So we starting
a little later than I wanted.
Yo, but you said you was gonna
creep out of school after lunch.
I tried.
They won't put me out.
Shit. Ain't no school
gonna hold me if I want to go.
It's this new class
they put me in.
It's so fucked up,
yo, they working all backwards and shit.
All right,
let's get to this:
Yo, Bobby,
you working the stash.
Yo yo, why aren't
where we was yesterday?
- The spot was right.
- This is good here?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
He was on this strip yesterday.
This ain't shit.
Yo, if you don't want to sell
my shit, then fuck you, Kenard.
I keep my money.
This spot is just
as good as the other.
Shit...
Carv, do you know how much
that video camera costs?
$4,200, which makes
our adventure with Fuzzy Dunlop
Iook like a fucking
walk in the park.
To get the camera
from l.S.D.,
I had to get authorization
from your supervisor, right?
Still, you lost it
doing police work.
Your lieutenant
will understand.
Marimow? You know what
that asshole understands?
Burning motherfuckers
for petty shit like this.
- Help me, Carv.
- This is not my problem.
Don't fuck me, Carv.
Don't fuck me now.
You know what this is?
This is one of those
enabling relationships.
Enable me, Carv.
Enable me to find
my fuckin' camera.
You're seeing pigeons?
Last night we did.
Me and Sydnor ran
the Westside
Iooking at every pigeon
coop we could find.
This morning,
nothing in the monitor.
- Did you check the pawnshops?
- Every one.
I fucking know this asshole Marlo
has my camera.
- Aw, fuck me.
- What?
You just reminded me.
I had to brief this kid
last week who said he knew
something about a murder
that Marlo's people did.
- I meant to call Bunk on it.
- Bunk caught the case?
No. Actually, he had a warrant for
the guy who supposedly got killed.
I rode around with him
on it a while back.
What about me?
I got problems here, man.
The only thing
you can do
is get some wood
on Marlo Stanfield or his people.
Scare him enough
to send the camera back.
What do you
have on Marlo?
I know he's a drug dealer.
I can't prove it
or nothing, but I know.
Detective Pitts,
pick up 2594. Pitts...
Okay, listen.
How about I let you
debrief the kid first?
- See what he can give you.
- This gets the camera home?
Maybe not,
but you talk to the runt,
and maybe he gives you
some shit on Marlo.
Maybe even gives you
a murder or two.
Before you call
Homicide on it,
you walk it
back to Marimow
Iike the cat
with the mouse in its teeth.
You bring him the murder,
he probably forgives the camera.
Lumen, line 5.
Lumen, pick up
the fucking phone.
Looking for
Detective Moreland.
Could you have him call Sergeant Carver
at the Western, please?
Carver? Western?
Hmm. Got it.
Fuck that Bunk.
- Thoughts on your cabinet?
- Lots of them.
But top of the list,
Ervin Burrell's ass is gone.
I told Royce to dump him
more than a year ago,
but Clarence didn't want to piss off
the ministers until after the primary.
Primary's over.
He can do it now.
You think Clarence Royce
is gonna do you that favor?
He's already thinking about
taking a poke at Elijah
and running for the Seventh District
congressional seat.
He's gonna need every black minister
in town to lay hands upon him.
- Fine. I'll do it myself.
- No, you won't.
Royce can fire
a black police commissioner,
but the newly-elected
white mayor cannot.
Same brothers who voted
for you'll be at your throat.
What if I got a black commissioner
to replace the son of a bitch?
Under Burrell, the only black deputy
is Cawthorne, and he's 70.
After that, it's just
majors and lieutenants.
We go outside--
nationwide search.
Deputy chiefs
in New York or L.A.
make more than
their police commissioner.
If you're talented and black,
why would you be in Baltimore?
I have often asked myself
that very question
on a number of occasions.
So I'm stuck
with Burrell. Fuck.
Have a seat.
Don't keep him late.
He's got to be at school in the morning.
I thought you said
he was suspended.
They're letting me
back in tomorrow.
Miss Anna'd want me
to be home by 9:00.
Don't forget to send him
on to Bunk
after you're done.
Look after him.
He's a good kid.
You hungry?
Yeah.
Let's eat.
Hey, kid, let me ask you
right off the bat:
You know what a police
surveillance camera looks like?
Councilman, you sure you don't want
to ride with Lieutenant Grace?
I mean, she'll be
in command of the ship.
What's the point
of a ride-along with the bosses?
I need to see what
the troops see, right?
Fine. I love
the idea of a mayor
who knows what
we're up against.
Officers McFarley
and Ginter,
this is the mayor-elect,
and he'll be riding
with you in sector three.
- How you doing?
- Hey.
Don't let him get captured.
Obviously, I didn't know nothing
about it in the beginning.
Little Kevin--
he just told me to tell Lex
to go up to the playground
behind Fulton
'cause his girl was up there.
- And Lex got killed?
- Yeah.
Where'd he get killed?
So you actually weren't there
to see him killed?
I told you.
Little Kevin-- he just told me
to tell Lex to go up
to the playground and see
this girl Patrice.
Then later, Kevin come up
to me and tell me
Chris and Snoop
killed the dude.
- What's Kevin's last name?
- I don't know.
- You don't have his name?
- Little Kevin is all I know.
So let me
get this straight:
You told the guy
to go somewhere,
and then you heard
he was killed,
but you don't know
where he was killed,
and you don't even know
if anyone ever found the body?
- How do you know Lex is really dead?
- Everybody know it.
- Who is everybody?
- Everybody from around the way.
Yo, listen.
People be saying that Chris
and Snoop be turning niggas
into zombies for Marlo,
but I know that ain't true.
When you dead,
you dead is all.
Zombies, huh?
You know what this is?
This is bullshit.
- You're bullshitting me.
- No, sir.
You were right there when this
Lex fellow got dropped, weren't you?
- No.
- Yes, you were.
You're an eyeball witness
who can get me Snoop and Chris both.
- I told you--
- Look, kid.
If you were there,
you can say so.
We can do a lot for you,
maybe help you out with this problem
you got at the school.
I ain't got a problem no more.
I'm good with that.
- You were there, right?
- Herc.
Just say you were there!
So how do you like
being mayor so far?
I've still got to win
the general election
and the inauguration's
not till December.
So what do I know?
Well, you can't do
any worse than Royce.
City's going to shit.
Yeah. Well, what do
you guys suggest I do first?
An air strike.
White phosphorus.
Drop that shit on everything
between here and North Avenue.
Seriously.
That shit works.
My brother's a marine, right?
They use W.P. over
there in Fallujah.
Signal 13, shots fired.
200 North Calhoun.
Bang.
There it is.
Now you're gonna see some shit,
Mr. Mayor. Pardon my French.
You know
what's fucked up?
No one hears the gunshot.
On the canvas, no one
even claims to hear the shot.
So look,
our next move is
to work back on
Wardell's visiting list.
If the sergeant asks,
I'm on the street.
Fuck, is that 13
on Calhoun Street?
I don't know, but they 1032'd
10 minutes ago, sir.
You're not dropping me off
at my crib, are you?
I mean, you can
leave me, like,
a block or two
up from here.
I could walk
the rest of the way.
Don't want to be seen
with the police, huh?
Yeah.
All right, boss.
I'll pull over right here.
What the fuck was
Carv thinking?
This kid can't
give me a murder.
We go right at Marlo.
Fuck the backdoor when we can
go in the front, you know?
Next I want a detective
at University
in case the guy that comes out
makes any kind of declaration.
Right, and have someone
in the room with him.
Officer Leach is being transported
down to you by a sergeant.
Service weapon's
with Detective Hollister,
on their way
to Ballistics.
No. No, looks like
a clean shoot.
I've got spent shells
from two suspect weapons,
different calibers,
both recovered.
Right.
Yeah, I know.
No, I'm not out here
at the scene.
But call the P.I.O. and have him issue
a statement from downtown.
Tell the S.A.O. that if they want
to have someone out here
survey the scene, they need
to move now 'cause Crime Lab
is finishing up,
and the O.C.M.E. van is here waiting.
Yeah....
isn't that the Western
District commander?
Yeah, that's Daniels.
He's the duty officer tonight.
Seems to know
his business.
He ain't as bad
as some.
Police.
Baltimore Police.
Okay. There's still 85 eligible
from September
who need an October day.
That'll work, ma'am.
I'm counting on you
fellows to get it done
before the end
of the month.
I can keep you
on salary till then.
You know what?
This ain't for me.
Look. I thank you
for the opportunity, ma'am,
but it ain't so much
just to bring a man for a day or two.
I mean, if you had something
where I was working
with these kids...
Anyway, thanks again.
- David.
- Hey.
Thought you was
at lda Wells.
Language arts position
opened up here,
so I came over last year.
- Hey. What's up, Coach?
- Hey.
You come over for some of
your boys today? Some kind of program?
Nah. Something else.
Didn't work out really.
Be well.
You mind
if I give him a go?
- Sure.
- Fuck you!
Okay.
But you're still
in this room.
Fuck you!
You know you're not going back with
the others till you learn to behave.
- Fuck you.
- Until you show you can handle it,
you're not going back
to your regular class.
Fuck you.
Look. And you damn sure
ain't going home
'cause there ain't no more
getting suspended.
Mr. Colvin, sir?
Fuck you.
'Cause I ain't feel like it.
That's why.
This is bullshit.
I ain't reading
no motherfucking book either!
I don't even know nothing
about the damn book.
And you always getting on my ass
and shit about some book.
Fuck you,
you cheese-faced bitch!
Albert, Albert,
settle down now.
This gonna be harder
than we thought, man.
It's fascinating, isn't it?
All right. Class...
This ain't no different
than the other class...
Clinically speaking.
Yo, your point's full.
I'm hot.
Come and get it.
All right.
I'll cover that.
- Me too.
- I'm betting with my boy Randy.
You about to get
your money taken.
Come on.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Pay up, sucker.
Randy, what are you doing?
Didn't we go over this?
How many ways
can you make a four?
Not enough
for his black ass.
Look who's talking.
Yo, he just come today,
so he missed
the whole thing about the odds.
Right.
Randy,
there's only three ways
to make a four,
- but to make a seven--
- Six.
That's good. So what should
have been your play?
Should have bet
against her roll.
Good to have you back,
Mr. Wagstaff.
Come on,
roll 'em, man.
I got 40.
I got 40 on it.
Trick them into thinking
they aren't learning, and they do.
Been looking
all over for you.
You found me.
Look, I been thinking,
Sherrod...
we're going about
our thing all wrong.
You know, look,
I made the mistake.
I was thinking I knew you better
than you knew yourself.
This corner-- this corner
mess will bring you down fast.
You know. I think you need
to come home, right?
You come by tonight,
and we work this shit out together.
I been thinking
about it.
Why don't you just
step right now?
I don't get paid till 8:00.
8:00, huh?
You all right?
Just a little tired,
that's all.
So I'm gonna
see you tonight, right, Sherrod?
You want to help me
take his statement?
Braddock case is down.
Room two.
You veteran crimefighters
got a name for this here, right?
"Murder weapon"
or some shit like that?
No fucking way.
Slug from autopsy matches
two more I pulled from
that smoke hound's backyard,
block into the side alley
from where Braddock fell.
- Our guy's dead from a stray.
- Hmph.
He was shooting
at 40s and Clorox bottles blocks away,
using potatoes for a silencer.
Bite me.
That's ridiculous.
So our guy's dead
because a bullet misses a bleach bottle.
And this fuck Carcetti
gets to be the mayor
behind this stupidity.
I fucking love
this town.
I do.
Nice pull, Greggs.
What's up, guys?
Sherrod!
So, Rashad has 82 apples...
and 12 friends...
all of whom are hungry.
And so he looks
carefully at his apples
and sees
that seven have worms.
Another 15 have gone rotten.
But he wants to be fair
and distribute all
the good apples equally.
"Distribute"?
Give out.
Well, just say that, yo?
Okay.
Okay, so how many apples
does each of Rashad's friends get:
A, 4; B, 5;
C, 6; or D, 7?
Take your time,
but do it fast.
Hey. Nigger said,
"l got my rights,"
so my boy said,
"Oh, yeah?
Well, he's got a left
to go with your right. "
He was like, pow!
- Calvin, you are done already?
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?
- B, 5.
How did you work
that out so fast?
Easy.
"B, 5" got the dinks.
- The what?
- If you want, I could show you.
Don't show him,
show me.
All right.
You did this with
the earlier math class, right?
So, you, like,
got 82 apples...
12 niggers...
and then how many
blah, blah, blah--
then you went, like,
dinking all round this one
and no other one.
So, answer is "B, 5."
Everybody get that?
Yeah.
"B, 5,"
it got all the dinks.
"B, 5,"
I'm an Audi 5000.
The priority should
be on making sure
the age files are up to date
with all notes transcribed,
the standard office report.
Uh...
on our day shift today,
you may encounter
Councilman and Democratic
mayoral nominee Thomas Carcetti,
who's been fact-finding
within the department.
So, if you go
leaving your fax
Iying around and he finds them,
that shit's on you.
Lastly...
as most of you
are already aware,
our ClD Commander
Raymond Foerster,
after a long bout
with cancer,
passed away last night
at Johns Hopkins.
Ahem.
Better eulogies are coming.
So, let me just say
that the man
served 39 years--
attaining the rank
of colonel--
without leaving a trail
of bitterness or betrayal.
In this department,
that's not a career, it's a miracle.
There'll be a detective's
wake this evening
followed by viewings
on Wednesday
and a burial mass on Friday.
The family suggests donations
to the colonel's
favorite charities.
The addresses will be posted
in the coffee room.
All told.
And, Bunk, I just got
your overtime for the week.
Get down to my office
and pull your pants down.
Mm-hmm.
No no no!
Fuck that.
You've finished your pot,
you make the next one.
Okay.
I don't see the right
one in here anyway.
- Sergeant Hauk.
- Yes, sir.
I just got off
with Beauford at lAD.
He tells me there's a harassment
complaint been filed.
Some Jamaican woman
says you had her stopped
and searched
by Amtrak police.
Yeah. Well, you see,
in my report,
we had what we thought
was reliable info
that she was a drug courier
for Marlo Stanfield.
I mean, we actually scoped
Stanfield with her.
What was the info?
The Cl's been reliable.
Great track record
with us.
Long history.
Cl 238.
Give me his name.
His name: Sir.
Sir!
I've never been comfortable
with, you know,
tossing around names
of informants in squad rooms.
I feel that it's--
- Name.
- Fuzzy Dunlop, sir.
I might have to set up a meeting
with this character.
He's kind of leery of meets.
He's been reliable,
I promise you.
I mean, this one baffled
the shit out of me, too.
But he's never
been off, never.
You jumped out
on bad information, Sergeant.
You brought in
another agency,
and you brought
discredit to this unit--
my unit.
In good faith though, sir.
Anything comes of this,
I have your report,
and I will bury you with it.
And in case
you haven't been
paying attention
to the election results,
your rabbi has
left the building.
- No tantrums today?
- What's the point?
They're not even gonna
suspend us, right?
Right.
What's the point?
So, we're here,
like it or not.
If it makes you all
feel any better,
the word around school is
you're down here because
you beat the system.
You had no interest
in being in a classroom,
and you made the classroom
impossible for everybody else,
and now you are out.
You won.
- Ha ha. Yeah!
- You feel like winners?
- Always.
- That's how we did.
Who's we?
- Us.
- No, who are you?
- Players.
- Kingpins?
Nah, that comes later.
Right now, we are
just corner boys.
So, how long until
you are kingpins?
I am thinking
two, three years.
Two, three years.
Let me ask, and I want everybody
to write this down--
where do you see
yourself in 10 years?
Come on,
pencil and paper.
This isn't schoolwork,
this is about y'all.
She's young
but she's good.
Yeah, a doctoral candidate
from the psych department
of College Park.
Thesis work is on social
alienation and analysis.
All right, show of hands,
how many wrote "NBA"?
Yeah, but only
for the Lakers though.
I want to be
a pediatric neurosurgeon
Iike that one nigga,
what's his name?
- Ben Carson.
- Yeah, that dude.
He's a black surgeon at Hopkins
with a lot of profile.
You want to be a surgeon,
you need to go to medical school.
Whatever.
How many wrote
down "dead"?
Shit, you saw
that coming, huh?
It's a shame
you all have so little time,
and you're wasting it
here with us.
You know where
you're going.
We can't teach you anything
you don't know about that, right?
That's what
we've been saying.
Namond,
put away the magazine.
I ain't reading
no magazine.
- Namond.
- What?
It ain't even mine.
It was laying here
when I came in.
Y'all little pissers.
You know, we are giving
them a fine education.
"lt ain't even mine.
It was just laying here
when I came in."
You know
this right here--
the whole damn school--
the way they carry themselves,
it's training
for the street.
The building's the system,
we the cops.
Yeah, you are for sure.
I mean, you'll come
in here every day
and practice getting over,
try running all
different kinds of games.
You know, it's practice
for the corner, right?
Ain't no real cops.
Ain't no real danger.
But you'll all getting
something out of this.
Bet you didn't
even know that.
Still I'd rather
be out there.
Can l?
Corner boys, huh?
Let me ask
y'all something.
You know, you help us
hone in on this,
and maybe we do
a little better job with you in here.
- What makes a good corner boy?
- Keep your eyes open.
- Keep the count straight.
- Don't trust nobody.
If you stupid in the hood,
you get killed.
That's the only way.
And I am telling you,
this name in black right
here got stink on it.
Eyeball witness, Bunk.
Vernon, at least go back
to the scene with me
- and take a fresh look.
- You're out of line here, Bunk.
You are.
A lot of names.
Too many.
No, we're good with it.
Listen, you back-seat-
driving motherfucker,
the guy picked him out--
Omar-fucking-Little.
Why he picked him out?
Who the fuck cares?
We got a dead female
taxpayer on our hands,
- and somebody's saying him.
- I don't buy.
And look who you talking about.
This ain't the motherfucker
that came up with
62 ways for the peanut.
His name pops up on five
or six cases I know of--
including two of yours-- and you want
to put him back on the street?
But this ain't him.
That means someone else
is walking on you all.
Let me tell you
something, Bunk:
the next body you catch,
I'm going to be
crawling all over it,
second-guessing
your ass every step,
pulling on every last
motherfucking thread.
Yeah. We going to see
how you like it.
Hey, Vernon.
Vernon, Vernon,
Vernon, Vernon.
- Just go back on it with me.
- What?
Shit doesn't play out
any differently...
I'll give you a back rub that
you ain't never going to forget.
Ahem.
You know, you guys don't
need to do anything
you wouldn't normally do
just 'cause I'm here.
I wouldn't know what we
normally do around here.
I'm new
and inexperienced.
Oh, you're...
Yeah. I am.
Seriously, I'm just
trying to get a feel
for the department's
response to the violence.
I'm not the hall monitor
or anything.
So, this is your day?
We catch a body,
it's different.
Mmm!
I believe
you got my camera?
- I what?
- License and registration.
You do me one,
I'll do you.
You got a card
or something?
City, huh?
Video camera
gotta come back.
Yeah, well, I see what
I can find out about it.
But you know cameras--
kind of like pigeons
in the storm.
You know
what I'm saying?
Sometimes they come back.
Sometimes...
But I keep an ear
out on it.
Hey, Jim,
he just say pigeons?
He's fucking with you.
Look, you just got
to tell Marimow
that you used the camera
for the PC at the train station.
And then just admit
the camera got took.
I already put it
down to the Cl.
I tell dickhead the truth,
- he takes my stripes on it.
- Oh, come on.
Look, I'm just saying
you weren't suspended that long.
Is it because
Tiff dropped it,
or because you had to do
something for Miss Donnelly?
- Do something?
- I don't know,
Iike promise or something.
No, Tiff dropped it,
so it's dropped.
Ain't nothing past that.
That's good. You know,
the thing with the teachers
and cops and whatnot,
they always come at you
Iike think they got you
by the ass.
But you keep
your mouth shut,
ain't nothing
they could do.
So, more times than not,
they go away.
Word on that.
I mean, it don't even matter.
And Miss Anna...
she got me on this
short leash right now.
Can't go out the house unless
she know right where I'm going.
Shit, at least
you've got a leash.
Dewey!
What the fuck is that?
Club soda...
and lime.
Omissive bitch.
Why not just suck a dick
and get it over with?
That will get the bad
taste out of your mouth.
Ah.
Yeah.
Almost new.
Don't wear
no dead man's hat.
I'm just fuckin'
with you.
Here, let's pray.
Here we lay a couple
of New York boys
who came too far south
for their own fuckin' good.
Fucking Yankee proud of it now,
you fuckin' bitches.
Let's get the fuck
out of here.
You hungry?
You want some Chinese?
No talking.
Keep your eyes
on your paper.
Yo, Mr. Prezbo,
this say "cars."
- So?
- All the stuff we did in practice
was about food.
It's okay. It's just
a different object.
Pay attention
to the number.
Numbers are
messed up, too.
We never did one-thirds.
It's the same operation--
1/4, 1/5, 1/3.
Follow the same steps.
It's just a different denominator.
How do you get
1/3 of a car?
It's actually
1/3 of all the cars.
Was I talking to you?!
You get close enough...
you could take
a headshot. Why?
'Cause maybe
he vested up.
Word. A chest shot
maybe won't do it for you.
Then what: You.
- It's his turn.
- Thug, you on it.
You gotta shoot
from a distance,
you can't risk
a headshot.
You go for the belly,
the dick or the ass area.
Because the vest don't
go down that far.
Bam! Take them out.
- Then what?
- Walk up,
- finish them off.
- With a...?
Headshot.
Damn, y'all coming
along full effect.
I hear it--
I hear that.
All right,
now say he in a car.
Sergeant Thomas Hauk,
Baltimore City Police.
Didn't I say City
would come running?
- Did.
- I'll check this joker out for you.
See what's what.
One other thing,
you're are doing
okay running them
New York niggers
of off East Side. I know that.
But this thing you got
with disappearing the bodies...
My man is saying if you just
vanishing the bodies like that,
it do kind of defeats
its own purpose.
Niggers don't know
if they went back
to the Bronx
or whatever.
- You feel me?
- Of course.
I'll tell my people.
Hey, no disrespect to your
professionalism or nothing.
We all impressed how you
Iose the motherfuckers
like that.
We just trying
to send a message
to these New York people
in full effect...
you know
what I'm saying?
I'll get back
to you on this.
So, Councilman,
I understand you were
a ClD yesterday.
See anything big
with those downtown boys?
Well, they messed up
the lunch order.
No, I figured
I needed to get closer
to the street, so that's
why I am out here today.
Rolling with the mighty
is east of the east.
Now, remember, we had
a shooting incident last week.
So, keep those corner fucks
to one window. Don't get surrounded.
Shit, remember we had
a van full of you guys,
- we'd find the fucking chap.
- What the fuck you say?
Dressed like that,
Stevie Wonder make you as police.
Keep your radio out of sight.
Volume up on those boom boxes.
10 bucks say
we collar up first.
20 makes
it worth our while.
Mr. Mayor, you know what's great
about the Easter?
We are hungry motherfuckers--
respectfully, I mean.
So, you're saying,
you don't ever give
anybody a break?
- Anybody?
- Nah nah.
'cause if you let him
slide for a dollar,
it's a sign
that you're weak.
Today's dollar
is tomorrow's two.
Yeah, same with your crew.
Your boy come up short
saying spillage
or police or whatever,
you let him be, and then
he gettin' over on you.
- Then you a chump.
- So, you got to fuck him up.
- Yeah.
- You gotta, ahem, mess him up.
Nah nah. Something for real
happen, you do that.
If you do it over
some bullshit,
then all you did
was lose a good worker.
Oh, no.
Man, you gotta fuck
that nigger up, man.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
Whoa!
Stop talking
on top of each other.
This how you communicate
out on them streets?
All right, it's like this:
you boy come back to you,
- say this happened, that happened--
- Then you fuck him up.
In my mind, I'm gonna let him
make it out of his own cut, too.
If he good worker,
he know what he need to do.
Yeah, he got a point.
He got a point.
That's a good one.
If he thinks about it,
says it ain't his fault,
then that nigger
run a game on you.
And then you fuck
that nigger up.
- Yeah.
- All right, yeah.
- But why?
- You know it gotta happen, man.
You know
what I'm saying!
Wait wait wait!
One voice. One voice.
- Y'all, one voice.
- Yo, yo, D, you tell him.
There always
people watching.
Watching... you.
True. Yeah.
What's taking you boys
so long?
There he is now.
Hurry up,
hurry up, this guy.
This guy right here.
Fuck you, guys.
Hey, yo, yo.
Yo, man,
we need some pills.
Yeah, you in
the right place, man.
Get them for us.
Come on, man,
I'm going to work.
Yo, 20 for the pills
and 10 for you.
- Leave the bike.
- What, you want steal my bike?
What the fuck
I want your bike for?
I got a car.
Give me a minute.
$20 might not mean
nothing to you.
But I ain't making
that much money.
It's hard money.
Y'all some
lazy motherfuckers.
This shit is right
around the corner.
You have no idea how much
we appreciate this.
I love it when they come
to work pumped like this.
Shit.
Come on, man.
I'm going to work.
Come on, man.
I'm going to work, man!
It's bullshit, man!
This is some bullshit
right here.
For real! For real! I ain't got
no drugs, no shit on me.
I ain't got nothing on me, man.
And you taking my bike, too?!
I need that.
This is bullshit y'all be using!
- One down.
-...comin' in the hood fuckin' with us.
This is fucked up
right here, man.
Andre, how you doing?
This is a friend of mine--
Detective Moreland.
Hey.
You doing okay there
or what?
So, listen, for my friend here,
tell me one more time
how the thing went down,
will you?
- The boy came in.
- Omar?
- Omar.
- He puts the nine on her.
Says to me,
"Whatever you got."
Mm-hmm.
A nine, huh?
Where were you?
- Where you see me at.
- Mm-hmm.
Nine wouldn't
go through this.
- Why did you come out?
- 'Cause he said to.
Trying to save her life.
Right, I'm saying---
This is like
Bank of England glass.
Fort Knox glass.
And who put that
up there? Huh?
Guy must have had
an elephant gun or some shit.
I don't know.
The boy had a mask on.
A mask, eh?
Like Zorro, huh?
- When did that happen?
- A few weeks back.
- Put in a report?
- It got away from me.
Mm-hmm.
Andre.
We're going to need you
to come down to the office
and straighten out
a couple of things.
I'm running
a business here.
I ain't going nowhere.
Give me a bottle
of Mylanta.
Please.
His whole story is fucked,
and here's why:
First, it don't
make any sense.
The shooter took
out the woman
and left him breathing
to talk to you.
He should be dead, too.
Second, there's
a drug depot in there.
Ah!
The glass,
reinforced steel,
camera, low inventory.
And, third,
he's shining us on
about that
big-ass.50-cal hole
because I know
who put it there,
and he knows
who put it there.
And if he were to say,
"Oh, that?
That's Omar's previous.
Ripping off
a re-up in here--"
which is what happened--
he be fucked.
So what?
A guy comes in
the first time
with a.50 caliber because
he knows the glass is thick,
then comes back
the next week with a nine?
The job isn't about picking
the stories we like best.
Motherfucker. Now you're going to
lecture me about what the job is.
- My apologies.
- Okay. Let's go downtown.
It's a new law, yo--
three pills,
that's felony weight.
And you're on
a pre-indicted corner?
- What?
- You better show some stash.
Oh, it's off
the chart now.
Those DC boys down there,
too, right.
They love fresh Baltimore ass.
- Mm-mmm.
- I ain't know no stash.
They say
it's better than pussy.
- Those my pills.
- Yeah.
Have you ever heard
of federal guidelines?
Pre-indicted corners,
homeboy.
That's three years mandatory.
Unless you mitigate.
- Mit-a-what?
- The stash, front boy.
I don't know no stash.
Those my pills, man.
I'm high
right now, look.
Yeah.
They gonna love him
up in there. Come on.
- I saw him first.
- Yeah?
- Bitch is mine.
- Those are my pills, I swear.
That's two.
Get the fuck in the car.
Damn, fractions?
He's doing fractions.
Shit, you want to know
what we talked about
in my new class today?
- What?
- Slinging.
Yo, I'm not playing.
We talked about business,
about putting shit
on the damn street.
Nigga, please.
It was like
we schooling them.
Yo, my new class
is the shit.
Yo, you going
by the gym today?
No, man.
I gotta go vial up
what's left on this package
so I can re-up.
All right.
- All right, man.
- Peace, man.
That shit is
easy though, right?
I got to leave soon,
Duquan.
Okay.
What level are you on?
12.
Ah, I never
made it past 10.
Want to see me
get to 40?
That's cheating.
Want me
to show you how?
Baltimore City
Police Department.
Yes, ma'am,
this is Sydney Handjerker
with Handjerker,
Cohen & Bromburg.
I'm trying to locate
a Sergeant Thomas Hauk
in regards to a client
I am representing.
Hold, please.
Mayor's office,
Lieutenant Hoskins.
Yes, hello.
This is Ervin Pepper
of Pepper, Pepper
& Bayleaf.
I'm calling in regards to a Sergeant
Thomas Hauk in regards to a--
He's no longer on this detail.
Hold on for a minute.
Major Crimes.
May I help you?
This is Dr. Jay calling with
test results for Thomas Hauk.
He's on the street.
You want to leave
a message?
Hello:
Let's do it.
You've just got to
walk up on him, all right?
Snap one.
We've gotta make sure
he's from New York first, right?
Gotta ask.
Ask what?
"You from New York?"
No, ask a Baltimore question,
something a New York
nigger won't know.
- What's a Baltimore question, yo?
- I don't know,
Iike, maybe something
about club music.
They don't know nothing
about that shit up in New York.
Huh:
Ask him, like,
who Young Leek be.
( quotes lyrics )
Or K-Swift.
Man, I know nothing about
that 92Q shit, man.
Man, who gives
a fuck, yo?
You don't know
Marc Clarke?
"The Big Phat
Morning Show"?
You ain't right, girl.
The average Baltimore nigga is gonna
know all that shit, all right?
They don't listen
to that shit up in New York.
They listen to some bullshit
up in New York.
- Go ahead.
- All right, whatever.
Hey, got a bet
going on, man.
- What's up?
- Who's your favorite one
on "The Big Phat
Morning Show," yo?
What, are you a New York, girl?
Sonjay.
- Who? Who?
- Kill that show any day.
Snoop! Snoop, yo!
Snoop, yo! Yo!
Chill! Sonjay be
on the show too.
So maybe I ask the questions
from now on, all right?
And then they basically entrap
some poor bastard on a bet,
haul in
$20 worth of drugs.
Now they've got to
process him, feed him,
property voucher his bike.
Next thing,
they're working on
some 14-year-old smoke hound
like he's Bin Laden.
The big haul there is
three vials of cocaine.
I mean,
are you with this?
I've been fighting
this bullshit for years.
The only way to go
is high-end enforcement.
You pick the targets
that'll make a dent out there,
reduce the violence.
So what's the problem?
Problem is
I do what I'm told.
Meaning?
Mr. Mayor, I'm no more
a racist than you are.
The thing about
affirmative action--
I'm just talking policy here,
no offense intended--
- None taken.
- --it's a numbers game.
And numbers games
breed more numbers games.
You need a 20% hike
in the hiring of black officers
to keep up with
the city demographic.
But that's also got to be reflected
straight up the chain,
which means fast-tracking
some people past where their--
how do I say this--
there are experienced warrants.
And he who owes his good fortune
to the numbers,
abides in them.
Gotta show arrests
are up 15, 20%.
We'll worry about
the quality later.
So what you saw out there,
it's a con game,
a Band-Aid on cancers.
So no, I'm not with this,
but I do follow orders.
However, if those
orders were to change,
or if I had the opportunity
to change them myself...
Oh no, you not!
What's this shit
doing in my house?
I stretching bottles, Ma.
You ever see your daddy
bring his work home
with him like that?
That's what you got
a lieutenant for.
Police come through this door
instead of your mother,
they will have
this whole damn house.
This has all got to be packed up
and elsewhere right now.
All right, be cool.
Wait till Bey
hears about this.
Did you hear that naked-ass appeal
to racial solidarity?
I'd like to kick his
pale entitled ass.
Were you listening?
He's no more
a racist than I am.
Might have to
kick your ass, too.
What have you heard
about this fellow Daniels?
Major in the Western.
Yeah, he's there,
but not much politically.
I don't think he's got
any suction with anybody.
Where's the Rice-A-Roni?
Ma, where's the Rice-A-Roni?
There was this
boy on the stoop
that looked like
he was starving.
So you cooked it
for him?
Naw, I just gave it
to him.
You just gave it
to him.
Boy ate a raw box
of Rice-A-Roni?
How much did you sell
the groceries for?
Don't look at me
like that.
I gotta go out.
- $10?
- You have your Rice-A-Roni profits.
Michael, come on!
Boy, I ain't gonna let
you hold the DSS card
if you ain't gonna
do right by me.
You're gonna let me
hold that card.
You're a hard child.
Next time, don't go selling
the food out of our mouths!
Yeah, like y'all say--
don't lie, don't bunk,
don't cheat, don't steal,
or whatever.
But what about y'all, huh?
What, the government?
What it-- Enron? Ha!
Steroids, yeah.
Liquor business:
Booze is the real killer
out there.
And cigarettes--
oh, shit.
Hey, you got
some smokes in there?
I'm trying to quit.
And drugs paid
your salary, right?
No, not exactly,
but I get your point.
We do the same thing
as y'all,
except when we do it, it's like,
"Oh my God, these kids is animals."
Like it's the end of
the world coming.
Man, that's bullshit,
all right?
'Cause it's like-- what is it--
hypocrite-- hypocritical.
I mean, yeah,
we got our thing,
but this is just part
of the big thing.
Exactly.
But this corner-boy
thing, right?
All y'all did all this
talking up in here.
You think
you could sit down
and write down
the laws to your thing?
Hell yeah.
I'll do it right now.
Shit.
No, I'm talking about--
can y'all do it together?
I give the test
on fractions,
half the kids
have breakdowns.
I still have a lot of kids who can
barely handle whole numbers.
Well, if it's any comfort,
I have outside
of my advanced class
maybe half a dozen
reading at grade level.
Try having them on
the periodic table of elements.
The thing is,
it's your curriculum,
and you have to
stick to it.
- I can't. It's absurd.
- You have to.
That test in April is
the difference between
the state taking over
the school or not.
Maybe the state should.
Look, you teach math,
you teach the test.
North Avenue
is all about
the leave-no-child-behind stuff
getting spoon-fed.
And what do they learn?
Find some middle ground.
Every day try to do
a little for the statewide,
and keep a unit problem on
the blackboard for Donnelly.
You know,
if she comes to visit,
she thinks
you're on point.
The rest of the time,
do what you feel like
you need to do.
But be careful.
You're are still on the far side
of your evaluation.
The first year
isn't about the kids,
it's about you surviving.
Whoo-hoo!
Get up!
Get up!
Hands on your head.
- I was eating that.
- Fuck you.
- That's my lunch.
- Fuck you.
Find a wall,
motherfuckers. Man.
Get your feet up.
- This is harassment.
- What did I say to you?
"Fuck you."
That's what you said to me.
There's nothing here,
man.
Oops. My bad.
You want to play
games with me?
I'm going to be in your people's shit
like this every day
until my camera
comes home.
You hear me?
Every day.
You and yours.
Let's go.
Ah, that felt good!
The old Western DEU
rides again.
Yes?
Anyone from the ClD
reports at the front desk.
Any ClD reports
to the front desk.
Respectfully, sir,
I would feel better if you cleared this
through the chain of command.
Yes, sir.
I'll think about that.
- Problem with the bosses?
- One in particular.
- That was our mayor-to-be.
- Carcetti?
Seriously?
He wants to meet.
You and him? Alone?
He wants to talk about
the police department--
what works,
what doesn't.
You have
the mayor's ear now.
Look at you.
Here's the thing:
What do I say?
What do you mean
what do you say?
How honest should I be:
I mean, it's one thing
for me to talk technical shit
or enforcement strategies,
but the shit
that actually goes on?
I start talking about that,
I don't know if I can stop.
Cedric, this is
your chance.
This is a career.
What if I take my shots
at Burrell and Rawls
and he decides not
to clean house? What then?
The new mayor
calls you up,
asks you for
your take on things,
and you don't want to be,
what, a politic?
Carcetti-- ugh.
I don't even know the man.
If he is calling you,
it's because guys like
Burrell and Rawls are on the ropes.
- Maybe.
- I know there is a risk,
but maybe I'd fire away...
both barrels.
I'll wait out here, man.
Up top.
I'll wait, I'll wait.
You got that grub,
you got that pot?
Aw, wait.
( quotes lyrics )
Yo.
Who made that track?
Yo, who you talking to,
dawg?
I'm asking
who Young Leek be.
You mean
2 Phat's cousin?
- Who?
- No.
Nigga, then how the fuck
should I know?!
Yo, who the fuck
is you talking--
- Aw, shit.
- Not bad.
Fuck that nigga.
What up, B?
- Where Ma at?
- Upstairs.
Michael, my daddy
came home.
Daddy came home?
- Look who home!
- Michael.
Damn, you grew.
And a pack of Kools
for Macia.
Still tricking
for that clown?
You know, I don't understand
why people talk trash about him.
All I know
is he loves me.
Well, when you
get tired of him
going upside
your head and all,
you'll really know
who loves you.
Whatever.
Whoa.
Motherfucker, what?
He had 12 years.
Parole.
It was only
a drug charge.
You swore he wasn't
coming back.
This is a good thing,
Michael.
It's going to be
back the way it was.
The way it was?
We a family again.
You lied to me.
People change, Michael.
He said you can give him back
the independence card too.
He gonna take care
of all that for us.
Thanks for coming up
from Washington.
The party is happy
for the opportunity.
You've got some heat
behind you at this point.
- But down to business.
- The way we see it,
we've got to cobble together
a citywide turnaround,
call it the "Baltimore Miracle"
or some shit.
Which starts with
a 10% drop in crime.
Since that was
your campaign cry,
- you want the double digits.
- No doubt.
Denny's got to do a bricks-and-mortar
project downtown,
put his name on something.
We're flushed with stadiums,
got hotels out of the ass.
You guys got a good
convention center?
- And a convention center expansion.
- Gotta put something up,
get the sign
on it that says,
"Brought to you
by Tommy Carcetti
and the citizens of Baltimore."
Well, think on it,
but you don't have
- too much time to decide.
- Anything else?
Education always polls good.
Oh no, we've got to
stay away from schools.
Our last
four administrations
Ieft us with an inner-city system
with inner-city problems.
We get involved,
start talking shit,
it becomes our mess.
Gotta respect the depths.
One, you get
the drop in crime;
two, you build
something downtown;
and three, you stay
away from schools;
And, four, you keep
your boyish good looks.
You do all that, you might be running
for governor in 2008,
maybe take back that
statehouse for us, hmm?
- Can you get him a square corner?
- Easy.
You okay?
Yeah.
You sure?
- Is it something at home?
- No.
- Come on.
- I said no.
Okay.
If there's ever anything
you want to talk about...
there's me,
but if you'd rather,
I can write you a pass
to see the social worker.
Just say when.
Michael, do you want
to see the social worker?
No.
I have to say,
I've never seen kids like them
this animated
in a classroom.
Focused-- the corner
culture kids, at least.
The ones with deeper problems,
they opted out of that.
Deeper problems:
We're not just up against
corner logic in there.
I am seeing oppositional
defiant disorders,
clinical depression,
post traumatic stress,
and with the girl Shaundra,
borderline psychoses maybe.
With those
type of problems,
we are gonna have to have
a social worker here full-time.
But the corner kids, yeah,
they really came alive.
Yeah, when they talk
about what they know,
they talk from here,
and they stay on point.
Shit, they have been even
taking turns in there.
Question is:
Can we get them
in that kind of mindset
on stuff they don't know?
Can we have them learn
on faith alone?
In all honesty,
this is uncharted territory.
Where do you go
from here?
How about we just
let this ride,
see where it takes us?
All right, see,
here's the thing:
Once you got it,
it's all you.
Anything happen,
I'm gonna have to fuck you up.
Yeah, but that's nothing.
'Cause the guy trusting me
on this-- Marlo--
he'll kill you
and your whole family.
So don't go
shaking the bottles
'cause Marlo weighs
that shit every time.
- I ain't shaking shit.
- See that you don't,
'cause if you do fuck with it,
I'm gonna know.
All right, that's good.
All right, it's good.
All right, see,
you're under 13 and shit.
So you're safe from everybody
but me and Marlo.
- So I'm a lieutenant now?
- Yeah.
You're my lieutenant.
And all I get is
an extra $10?
Yeah, you do this good,
and we'll talk.
See this guy here?
That's the grand jury
prosecutor.
Now, you lie to us,
it's just good clean fun.
But you tell tales to that
three-piece motherfucker, ooh, shit!
I ain't telling lies.
Hey, Gary, let me ask you this
hypothetically:
How much time does a witness
get for lying to your grand jury?
Are you kidding?
As much as I can get him.
- What's the max?
- 10 years.
Oh, you've got people
going away for 10 years?
Oh, hell yeah,
all the time.
10 years!
I thought he was going to say,
like, two or three.
Hey, look, that motherfucker
went upside my head.
I couldn't even
see straight.
Which motherfucker
are we talking about?
Then they got me
on that medication.
It made me groggy as shit.
Then this man starts
working at me--
- Fuck I did!
- I mean, shit!
I'm still groggy now.
I mean, I got to--
is there a washroom around:
- Lying motherfucker.
- For real.
Pull over, asshole.
Shit.
Step out of the car,
please.
Step out of the car.
Put your hands
on the car.
Got anything on you?
Have a seat on the curb.
Have a seat.
Cross your feet.
Put your hands on your head.
What the fuck
is this powder?
Lime from my mama's garden.
What are you building,
a clubhouse?
Oh, that shoot nails.
Be cool.
Oh, I know what it does.
I want my fucking camera.
I heard what you said
at Comstat the other day.
I also hear you're a commander
who knows police work.
That's what people
are saying.
So, yesterday I did
a ride-along in Eastern,
watched street pops,
undercover rips.
- So what am I thinking?
- My guess:
You witnessed a waste
of time, money, energy,
and, in few cases, talent.
Rawls says it's Burrell
and his numbers game.
He says if I unleash him,
put him in the driver's seat,
then all that
bullshit goes south.
See a return
of high-end police work,
says it'll be the dawning
of a new day.
- Rawls said that?
- Yeah.
Says he's just
following orders,
being a good soldier.
What do you say?
Mr. Mayor, if you
want to talk to me
about what happens
in the street
or what goes on under me
in the Western,
I'll talk your ear off.
But I'm a soldier too.
I don't go up the chain
with my opinions.
I can respect that.
I will say this though:
We did have one unit
doing high-end stuff--
Major Crimes working out
of an offsite
down on Clinton Street.
"Did" is past tense.
What wrecked it?
Good question,
Mr. Mayor.
With Ray Foersters'
passing,
I'm going to need
a new ClD commander right away.
Would you object to being
made colonel working under Rawls?
Under Rawls?
He is deputy ops,
is he not:
Is the mayor going to
make the changes
or just leave it
to the good soldier?
What I'm really asking is:
How for real are you?
Well, I guess we're going to
find that out together, aren't we...
Colonel Daniels?
What the fuck do we do?
I don't know.
These guys don't scare.
If we all kick in--
you, me, Sydnor--
maybe we could afford
a used camera.
I thought of that.
It ain't gonna match
the serial numbers
from the one
for my lSD.
We've gotta get wood
on Marlo.
It's the only way.
This Randy kid,
he can't give us a murder, right?
Shit, he can't even
give us a body.
But he says some
Little Kevin kid
was the one supposed
to tell Lex to go up in that alley.
Plus, what did fuck-nut
say Little Kev said?
"Lex went up the alley,
but he ain't coming back."
Maybe he saw
the whole thing.
Maybe he's
our eyeball witness.
- Little Kevin:
- Little Kevin.
Carry the four.
80, 100, 10, 20.
420.
Where's the rest?
Um... I'm on a hard strip.
It's tricky on Lafayette.
What the fuck are
you doing there?
I've got to build it up.
Nah nah, you ain't got
to build up shit.
Your father built them corners,
and they owe you
'cause they owe him.
Bodie's got
a real short memory
when it comes
to giving props.
Ma.
I going to straighten
this shit out right now.
Ma, let me build.
Ma!
Sir.
Bill...
we need to regroup.
I've come up
with something fresh
for the new administration.
Hmm? I don't mind
telling you,
I'm uncomfortable with the way Carcetti
is running around in our shop.
He's talked to me
several times.
You're making
your move, huh?
We were a good team,
you and me.
We were.
- Miss Ella, where Bug at?
- He went home, Michael.
Nah, he waits for me.
The man who came and picked him up
said he was his father.
And Bug said so, too.
Fuck!
Mmm.
What the fuck
did you do?
And why'd you
let him do it?
- Hey, listen to me--
- No.
That's how you got him
with his head up his ass--
unsolving his own
fucking murders.
Your job is to turn red to black,
not the other way.
And you, stand the fuck up
for yourself.
You don't got to
do the whole thing
on your fingers,
little man.
Look, first count--
six and six is...
12.
Put down the two,
you bring over the one.
- Bug.
- Hey, big man.
Get over to me now.
- We were just going to--
- Now.
Yo, hold on.
Yo, you owe me $800 on that,
bitch. You owe!
But it's a snail,
you see,
and it go--
it go, "Meow."
It's a what, now?
What?
It meows.
Then it ooze all up
SpongeBob's belly
Iike it's his pet
and shit.
Yo, y'all niggers watch
too many cartoons, I swear.
Hey!
Look, see, this is what's wrong with
the justice system right here.
Niggers get locked up
and they don't stay that way.
They make it hard to
take this shit serious.
What, you snitchin'
or something?
Shit no, man.
You know they only
gave me, like, four, right?
Know what I'm saying?
I done 15 months.
So with good time, I'm like,
"Man, what the fuck?"
Shit.
Yeah, man.
So...
Yeah, man,
it ain't like it was, but it'll do.
- So who we slinging for?
- Marlo Stanfield.
- Come on, man!
- Yo, man, yeah.
I was getting this nice
package from Slim Charles,
but Marlo got the muscle
to hold us down,
so that's where we at.
Shit, one boss
same as the next, man.
Make sure they ain't
sleepin', all right?
Hey, yo, Little Kev,
I told you about
the boy, Poot, right?
Yeah.
Pussy hound.
You just home?
- How long in?
- 15 months.
You got laid yet?
Shit, I think
I already been burnt.
Shit, I might need a ride
to the clinic today.
I see ain't shit changed
around this joint.
On the wall, gents.
Make this easy
on all of us.
Which one of youse
is Little Kevin?
Come on, fellas.
It ain't no big deal.
We just need some face time
with the motherfucker.
Your name Kevin?
No, this is, uh--
Poot.
I'm Poot, yo.
Poot, right, yeah. Didn't you
get locked up or shot or something?
Society say l
deserve another chance.
Yeah? Let's see. Which one of
these dickheads here is Little Kevin?
- Man, I don't know no Kevin.
- Society can bite my dick.
Come on, Bodie. I know this kid
works up here with you.
- What's your name?
- Do I look little to you?
All right. Fuck this. Everyone
under 150 lbs or 5'6" is in the cab.
You, you, and you.
And unless I see birth certificates
saying otherwise,
you're my Little Kevins.
And if that don't get it,
we're coming the fuck back.
That's fucked up, yo.
You got any
paper on you?
Man, fuck if I know.
These police out here knew how
to flip it even just a little,
my shit would
be in handcuffs.
You know?
They don't know shit.
Damn!
You my ride?
I'm your motherfucking
savior, is what I am.
Told y'all Andre
was lying on me, yo.
I didn't do it
for you.
Fact is...
if I could work back on
whatever cases I already caught,
you might be going
right back inside.
I know.
So who did kill
that delivery girl?
I don't know.
Know it wasn't Andre.
His blood don't run
that kind of cold.
Who he getting his
package from?
Saying I could go back
to the crib and bear up,
find some things out
for you if you want me to--
You owe me,
motherfucker.
I'm saying
I know I do, man.
And if you want to pay down
any part of this debt,
you know what you
gotta do for me?
No more bodies.
No more fucking
bodies from you.
No more comebacks
or get-evens on this.
No more killing.
You owe me your word.
All right, man.
No bodies on me.
You really want
to ease my mind,
you'll let me drive you
down to Aberdeen rail station,
put you on a
northbound train.
Naw, man.
Baltimore's all I know.
You know what
it is like, homey.
Man gotta live what
he know, right?
You're absolutely right.
There are many significant
factors to consider,
but getting
crime under control
is key to sparking
investment here,
- jump-starting growth.
- If you make it safe, they will come.
Well, I hate to begin our beautiful
relationship with my hand out,
but I'm told that two federal grants
to my office dry up this year.
That's right.
Come the first of the year,
those DOJ grants evaporate,
and you're out 1 2 prosecutors.
Well, I was hoping you'd
be able to absorb that
in the general fund,
maybe even throw in
a little bit more,
make it competitive with the PD
and Attorney General's jobs--
starts the turnover.
It's killing us.
This would be the time to do it.
I mean, we're over the revenue
expected for this point
in the fiscal year
next to the
real estate market.
How much past? 'Cause l
want to come out of the box
with a big bump
in police salaries,
in particular the
commissioner's salary,
which needs to jump,
like, 50 grand.
Well, a good guess would be a
one-shot surplus of about 20 million.
But that's rainy-day money
for more than crime.
Word around North Avenue is that
the schools are running a deficit.
Excuse me. Did you say a
50,000 bump for Ervin Burrell?
Well, no, not
for Burrell per se.
Oh, for the next police
commissioner, then.
- That's what you mean?
- Well, looking ahead, it makes sense.
Because firing Burrell would
upset a good-sized block
of my constituency, not
to mention the ministers.
And I think the budget chair
might have a difficult time
allowing a higher salary
to be approved.
In fact, I can guarantee if
that proposal's in the budget--
your first, for the record--
the bill won't come out
of committee intact.
I'm just saying that in
the event Commissioner Burrell
were to leave, we'd want
to bump that salary
in order to attract
the best candidates,
in particular the best
African-American candidates
from across the nation.
With three years left in his term,
why would he leave?
Councilman, what may not have
been obvious to you
on the Public Safety
Subcommittee
is that the budget process
is a carefully orchestrated ballet,
a cooperative effort between
the branches of government.
Well, Madam President,
the nuances of that
cooperative effort
are beginning to come
into focus for me.
Thank you, Madam President.
Come on in, everyone.
Don't wait by the door.
Duquan, you're here.
Randy, you're here.
No, you two switch.
Calvin, you're here
in the front.
Quenice, you're here.
Michael, you're here.
Destiny, here.
Myesha, here.
Dashonda, here.
Come on, keep moving.
Don't stop at the door.
Come in.
Let's get started.
Could be a problem.
How so:
Your boy been assigned to
- what they call the Major Crimes Unit.
- Meaning what?
They the motherfuckers that did
the last three city wiretaps--
one where they bugged
Barksdale's office,
another where they hit
Kentel up in Park Heights.
And the last one-- shit.
They was all up on
Stringer Bell's cell phone.
You ain't still using
burners, is you?
I'm dumping them
every two weeks.
Not good enough.
You read that.
You'll see that Stringer was changing
his number every damn day
and they still pulled the motherfucker's
voice off a goddamn cell phone tower.
City police did that?
Where'd you get this?
Courthouse clerk's office.
Hey, the shit's
open to the public
after they finish
prosecuting your ass.
You need to lose
them cell phones, son.
Me-- I ain't as so much as
touched a burner in a year.
5'9" and 3/8?
You got it.
Now, hold the measure
and spread your
arms out to the side.
What you got?
I want one.
So, your cat can eat 'em?
So, how'd you find them?
I'm going to
the calculators.
Give me that.
Give it here.
The same.
Your height and your
arm span-- identical.
Quenice?
See, look. You about
to get me in trouble.
So, you say you
like to box, right?
You must have some
kind of reach.
Everything cheap
on computers
if you know where
to look for it.
Yo, this mean the price
I'm getting from the Koreans,
yo, they still
marking it up some.
They gotta be.
I can make twice
as much using this here.
Uh-uh.
Can't.
All this along the lower
Patapsco/Westport area
is ready for a turn.
The proximity to downtown
and the B.W. Parkway
make it ideal for Washington
commuters. That's a given.
- Anything to speed it up?
- A harbor promenade could work,
going west from both
sides of the bridge.
The South Harbor Promenade,
brought to you by--
Mayor Thomas Carcetti--
and the citizens
of Baltimore.
Doesn't quite have
the same ring
as a stadium or
an aquarium expansion,
- does it?
- It's a start.
Further east, you've got
the Locust Point Marine Terminal,
which, unfortunately,
is still a working enterprise,
and the further you go
into Brooklyn/Curtis Bay,
the more
the skyline disappears.
We lose
the Washington crowd.
For that part of
the waterfront,
- you're gonna need a different draw.
- Casinos?
Oh, the urban planning
default? I don't want to see
the kind of crime
that comes with casinos.
Tax base is tax base.
This is where
I get off the boat.
It's one thing to sell
waterfront for tax base,
but now you're just sucking
paychecks out of my community.
Well, it was just a thought.
And, anyway,
we're getting
ahead of ourselves.
This is just the first
long meeting of many.
So, thanks to everyone,
and we'll continue this later.
Madam President,
a word with you?
Do you have a minute?
You and me, we got
a problem already?
Just trying to help guide
you through the process,
Mr. Mayor... -Elect.
Felt more like you
were dragging me
across a minefield,
Nerese.
- Why you so pissed off at me?
- Look.
Clarence shouldn't have run again
for any number of reasons.
I was ready to step up,
and the deal was cut long ago
that he'd back me
when the time came.
You and Tony--
you guys jumped the line.
It wasn't your turn.
Oh, whoa. Whoa.
First of all, I'm sorry if Tony
and I ruined your party plans,
but I wasn't privy to whatever
you and Clarence cooked up.
That aside, I was kind of looking
forward to working closely together.
I think that we could
make things happen.
You're only getting
the one term, Tommy.
I'm not gonna stand
down next time.
What makes you think I'll even
be around that long?
Governor's race
is in two years,
and plans can change.
You might find yourself
mayor in 2008
without so much as
a campaign speech.
Wasn't easy
tracking you down.
The numbers I got for
you don't work no more.
I see you got
a problem.
Looking rough, Bubs.
I been keeping
it clean, you know...
pushing my carts and all.
But this one young man--
every time I cross him,
I get tossed
for what I got on me.
Cash, pills.
I mean, he look on me
like an ATM or some shit, I swear.
I'm ready to work, Kima.
Get this motherfucker off me,
I'll do what you need.
Look at me, Bubs.
I ain't in Narco.
Yeah, I see.
You look nice.
I'm working homicides.
So, if the bad boy
happen to kill me,
you can help me out then,
right?
If we drive around a bit,
you think you can put
eyes on this motherfucker?
I can try.
Get in.
So, Nerese is
bucking already.
Feels like if
the mayor's chair
ain't gonna go to Royce,
it should be hers.
Problem is she's gonna
see any proposal
to raise
the commissioner's salary
- as a move against Burrell.
- Which it is.
We can't raise the salary,
we can't attract strong
minority candidates.
No strong candidates,
we can't get rid
of the guy we got.
Fuck if I'm gonna live with
Burrell as my commissioner.
What if he quits?
Quits?
Maybe the man can be shamed.
If he leaves on his own account,
that takes us off the hook
with Nerese and the ministers, right?
No. I mean, we don't want
your credit card number.
I mean, we won't
even know the number.
We just need you
to order the candy.
And you have cash
up front?
He pay you back, Mr. P.
When he sell off, man,
he gonna pay you back.
Yeah.
Points on the
package, huh:
No way.
Aw, come on, Mr. Pryzbo.
I mean, doesn't it teach us
math? Addition, subtraction,
uh, a quarter,
a quarter of a dollar,
a dime, a tenth,
you know?
No cash, no card.
All right. Fine.
Cash up front.
No problem.
And if you come in with
a wad of bills tomorrow, Randy,
I want to know where
they came from.
I don't want either
of you out on the corner.
All right.
Ms. Thiessen, you okay?
Hey, uh...
I think my car's
been stolen.
Yeah, man.
All right...
so what I'm saying
is that you got from
Bentlow down there to
Rosewood right here.
All right?
Now, I got the block
from Monroe
all the way down
to Pacer,
so I got you covered
from that side,
but you gotta put lookouts
in Franklintown to catch anybody
- coming from the other way.
- All right, I got you.
- Are you ready to work?
- Yeah, just get my re-up.
We'll go on about
the shit for real.
- No, are you ready to work?
- Yeah. Ready to work.
- Donut, go talk to Little Kevin for me.
- All right. Watch the ride.
Hey, yo, look. Man, please do not be
having your mama come talk for you.
Man, I ain't have
her do nothing.
She just get on her horse
and come with it.
Look. I done did everything
I can for you and yours,
but from here on, your moms
can't do nothing to help. All right?
Him:
From Wee-Bey?
Your moms?
No sign of
the motherfucker Andre.
Store been padlocked a week.
Ain't even calling
for his re-up.
Huh.
Check the man at the jail?
Yeah.
People say Omar ain't even been
on the tier for two weeks,
so he either
staying someplace
or they got him
at county lock-up.
Or the charges
been dropped.
If this
cocksucker's sprung,
my man is backing
up on his story.
Mean he could
back up on y'all.
I'm on it.
How about
the New York boys?
We dropped five of them.
The rest went to ground.
Drive through East Baltimore,
you don't even see
a Baltimore nigger with a Yankee cap.
Want us to stay
on that, too?
I talked to the fat man,
but I think
we're done there.
This shit with Andre--
job one.
No.
We could try
the avenue again.
He be behind
the market sometimes.
Look, Bubs, I ain't
got all fucking day.
I'm on shift work now.
I'm working murders.
He banked me four times
this week, Kima.
I'm having dreams about this
low-bottom motherfucker.
All right.
I tell you what--
you want to work?
I'll call Sydnor or Herc
down at Major Crimes,
put you with someone
doing drug work.
You work for them, they'll
help you with your problem.
All right?
I need this now, Kima.
I'll tell them that.
Woman--
So show me where
you're living,
and I'll tell them
where they can find you.
Make the left.
I don't understand.
You told the man you not
gonna kill no one.
I gave my word on that.
Fuck we doing
back here then, Papa?
I can still put a gun
in Andre's face, right?
That man got some
explaining to do.
It's dead out here, yo.
Tip on out.
I don't know why he don't
trust us with it, yo.
I mean, we trustworthy,
ain't we?
Just gotta get enough for the first
order. Then we're good.
All right!
Hard six!
Come on, trey!
I'm in.
Go away, boy.
Oh, you in?
Yeah.
Pass line for me, yo.
Oh, shit!
Yeah. Get that money.
Get that money, shorty.
Get that money.
I heard tell of it,
but I didn't believe it.
All this overtime,
all for two cases
as a secondary.
First the names are red,
then they're green,
then they're black.
And that doesn't
even include the court pay
you make if the soft
case goes to trial.
Sweet.
So, what you gonna do
with yours, Detective Greggs, huh?
Pay down some debt.
- Why you leaving?
- Your luck ain't gonna change.
Don't worry
about that, man.
Yo, thanks for
walking us off.
I thought we was
gonna get banked.
You ain't gonna
bank us, is you?
Shit, boy.
You think I'm
that ungrateful?
I followed you
through 10 shooters
and made more money
that I have in a month.
Nah.
I ain't gonna rob you.
I just need to know next time
you fade a dice game. You feel?
I mean, it's all about
the math, you know,
the probabilities and all.
I ain't never seen
you in a game before.
Where you learn
your game?
Edward Tilghman Middle.
Shit.
All we got
is Little Kevin.
Oh, Bodie's boy, huh?
What'd I tell you? Bubs gets
it the first time. Here.
Y'all meet up with me
in the afternoon tomorrow--
after school lets out--
and I'll give
Kevin a new hat.
A hat trick?
Cool.
Yo, Herc, man?
What's up?
It's not about
the money this time.
He breaking me every day
unless I give him something.
I can't-- I can't
take it anymore, man.
Once we're done
with Kevin,
you go find this asshole,
hit my cell phone.
I'll be on him
five minutes later.
I promise.
Then you add this, yo,
and watch it fizzle.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Not so much.
Not so much.
You gonna make it spill
everywhere, you see?
What are you
still doing here?
Ain't nobody
want you here.
Your mama want me.
Yeah.
You and the pipe.
Shouldn't talk about your
mama like that, Michael.
- Hey, Daddy, see my volcano?
- Bug, go upstairs.
Bug need me, too.
Saturday, right?
Bug need me.
My teachers say
I gotta need glasses.
I gotta have
an adult with me.
Pick 'em up.
Sign for 'em.
Bug, go upstairs
to your room.
Ice cold, boy.
Where you be?
Ain't got a forgiveness
to your soul.
Man, fuck you.
Watch your mouth.
You're big,
but not big enough.
Now...
where's that D.S.S. card?
Your mama said
that come to me.
Ain't nothing left
on this month's check anyway.
Before the first
of the month, then.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Uh, come on in.
I see the little man done
took over the living room.
Good for him.
Well, you know how it goes.
Well, I'm just
messing with you.
Place looks great.
Even the toys look
like they belong.
This is...
this month and
two going back.
I'm just trying
to catch up.
I appreciate you not
coming after me for it.
Knocking over
liquor stores now?
Overtime from Homicide.
It stays like this,
and I won't have a problem
coming up with my share.
Kima--
this ain't,
"Please take me back,"
but a deal's a deal,
right?
Hey, I'm home.
Hey, Elijah.
Hey.
Um, Kima, this is
Nancine Owens.
Sorry.
The place is a mess.
You could stay for dinner,
but tonight we have
people coming over.
It's a kind of
a celebration, actually.
Yeah?
I passed the bar
this week.
Huh.
Congratulations.
Most of the gals I work with
have a problem with that.
With what?
Passing the bar.
Well, guess
I better be going.
Thanks for coming past.
Let's make bed...
Yeah.
Nice meeting you.
- Elijah?
- Huh?
Say bye to Aunt Kima.
Bye.
Uh-oh.
Where's Dre?
I don't know!
You believe her?
No.
One last time.
Where's Andre?
He-- he said if he told
me where he was going,
I'd have to tell you.
I don't know.
I don't know.
You believe her now?
Yeah.
Dang.
Sure is quiet this early.
Yo, you gonna come
with me to see Mr. P?
No, go on up. I'll see you
in homeroom.
All right.
Mr. P.
Randy.
Randy, how did you--
six beats four
or five.
And most times eight is better
than 10. Right?
You schooled me good.
- You gambled for this? I didn't even
- Pick up the dice.
I was all, "Pass,
no pass."
Got to the point where some
of them was following me in there.
You shouldn't gamble.
I know, but I'm just saying,
the math be right, Mr. P.
But I'm gonna
come back at lunch,
and we can computer up
that candy, all right? Peace.
Resign?
Either that or the day-to-day
running of the department
falls to the Deputy Commissioner
for Operations.
Erv, I have made no secret
of wanting to make changes.
Oh, so Bill Rawls is now
the voice of reform, is he?
This isn't about Rawls.
I have no faith in you,
given recent events.
I know you remember the two of us
sitting in this same booth
a year ago, you
telling me about
how you respect
the chain of command.
Well, respect it now.
Every department head serves
at the pleasure of the mayor.
So, if you're
firing me, Mr. Mayor,
I want you to know
I will go quietly.
You'll tender your
letter of resignation?
Oh, no.
I'm not offering
to resign.
If you want me to go, you're
gonna have to shitcan me.
A small distinction,
I know, but...
in the meantime,
since you have Bill Rawls
doing my job for me,
and it's such
a nice day out,
I think I'll go to
Forest Park and shoot nine.
The check is yours,
I think.
Pick a table, any table.
Eiffel Tower, Big Ben,
Empire State Building.
Your table is your team.
The team that puts its
model together first wins.
Now, you say y'all can work
together out on the corner.
Let's see how
you do on this.
Wins what?
Big fat gold stars
and some shit.
Dinner downtown. Any restaurant
you can agree on.
Since y'all only
seem willing to be
interested in stuff you know,
we looked for things
more like Baltimore.
The scale model of the
Fayette Street stash house
was all sold out.
So, y'all just gonna
have to make do.
Hey, um, Mr. Colvin, the box say there's
supposed to be some instructions.
We took those out. Makes it
more interesting, don't you think?
Yeah, it ain't like we follow
instructions anywhere else, right?
And I ain't even want to
put no charges on no more.
But see, they made me
do that,
and now they're gonna be mad
at me 'cause it ain't stick.
Who be "they"?
People I'm getting
the package from.
I'm asking who.
Boy named Marlo.
He's big on the West Side.
You heard of him?
Vaguely recall the name.
So, I just need to
chill for a while
till they remember
how to forget.
So, now you come
over East Side
and expect me
to hide you.
Why is it that every
Baltimore nigger think
that running the fuck away
means crossing downtown?
Shit, you ought to be in New York
or Philly or some shit.
No, see, I know that. It's just that
I don't know no one outside of B'more.
And I was just hoping, let's say,
trade out my store, you could maybe
front me some cash, get me
out of town with people you know.
I mean, I'd come to
the East Side to you,
but too many West Side
motherfuckers are with Marlo.
You know what the problem
with these here machines?
They too cheap
to begin with.
Some people would think
for what it's worth
to fix it and make
the shit work right,
you might as well dump
them and get another.
2,000 and a free ride north
for the store
and its contents.
Store worth way more, Joe.
It depends, don't it:
No, it goes on
the other side and shit.
Stop fucking fronting me.
I want to do something.
You gonna curse at me again,
I'm gonna cut you.
Get that shit
out my face.
I don't even want to
do this shit no more.
That's how you
always do it.
What are you doing?
Look at the box.
Do that look like
that's on the box?
I can't do this.
Nigger, come on, now.
I'm trying to eat.
- Give me that piece, yo.
- Fuck you, yo,
because you don't even
know what you're doing.
Just sit there and shut up
because you just don't know.
Come over here
and make me shut up, then.
Yo, you starting
to piss me off
'cause you don't know
what you're doing.
You're too stupid.
Hey, Z, you do the top
while I do the middle.
Darnell, you got
the leg parts, all right?
Yeah yeah.
Like that. Like that.
Shit!
Done.
Aw, that's bullshit.
He's cheating, yo.
Go ahead and touch
it, baby.
That shit
built to last.
What about the extra pieces?
What extra pieces?
What's in your pocket?
Ain't nothing in my pocket.
So, uh, who cook a good
steak around here?
Okay.
One-- From the day
of my inauguration,
Commissioner Burrell
is to undertake no initiative
without
clearing it with you.
Day-to-day administrative
responsibilities
are to reside with
the deputy office
if they don't already.
I like that.
No problem.
Two-- I need to elevate
Stan Valchek.
Good man, Valchek.
He's a hack, but he's my
hack, and I owe him.
If I make him
Deputy for Admin,
can he cause
any real damage?
I'll watch over him.
No problem.
Three-- I'm bumping Daniels
from Western Command to colonel,
giving him ClD
and carte blanche
to fix
the investigative units.
- Cedric Daniels?
- Problem?
No, he's good police.
He's just got...
a little
independent streak.
Independent from who:
I got no problem
making Daniels.
What else do you need?
That's it for now.
Mr. Mayor, about Ervin--
if you don't mind
my asking,
why keep him as
a puppet commissioner
when you can just
fire the guy?
We mind you asking.
I'm partial
to them cherries.
Yo, Dukie.
Hmm:
You ever call Social
Services on your mother?
What?
I don't know.
I just want to know what happens
if you call Social
Services on somebody.
You want to
report your mother?
She brung someone home
and he won't leave.
You don't want to
call Social Services.
They get to looking
into things,
they could put you
in a group home,
split you and Bug
up, even.
But I don't
want us to leave.
I just want
him to leave.
Talking about Bug's daddy,
ain't you?
Maybe you ought to
talk to a teacher about this.
I mean, Mr. Pryzbo is
real good about stuff.
Mr. P did say I could go talk
to the school social worker.
He an alcoholic.
Oh, um, what about that boxing
guy, Mr. Cutty?
What's wrong with Cutty?
I don't know.
Like, he just
too friendly, you know?
That shit
creep me out, man.
Like, he some type of
faggot or something.
Nah, not Cutty, man.
He be all up
in the women.
Yo, don't you see
how he be doing?
That don't mean shit.
Them faggots will be
just like that, too.
And I don't know.
He just too friendly, you know?
Everybody just too
motherfucking friendly.
No fucking way.
So, his name is--
what'd you call him?
It's like a joke.
Yeah. They flipped it.
- Bunch of fucking clowns.
- Mm-hmm.
Last year we had MSAs
in the 22 percentile.
And don't think they
haven't noticed it
down at the Puzzle Palace.
The word is they're looking for
at least a 10-point increase
from all city middle
schools this time around.
We're still six weeks
away from the MSAs
and you want us to start
teaching the test now?
This year, the preferred term
is "Curriculum Alignment."
There's nothing wrong
with emphasizing the skills
necessary for the MSA.
If we can get them
to write a paragraph
without a four-letter
word in it,
it'll have to have better
command of English.
Marcia, skill sets
are one thing,
but this has us teaching
test questions direct,
test questions
that involve skills.
I don't see your point.
You don't want
to see the point.
Were you really expecting
something different than last year?
I don't see the math section.
These are all language arts questions.
Our greatest failing on
standardized tests last year.
So, for the time being,
all teachers will
devote class time
to teaching language arts
sample questions.
Now, if you turn
to page 11, please,
I have some things
I want to go over with you.
I don't get it.
All this so we score
higher on the state tests?
If we're teaching the kids
the test questions,
what is it assessing in them?
Nothing.
It assesses us.
The test scores go up,
they can say the schools
are improving.
The scores stay down,
they can't.
- Juking the stats.
- Excuse me?
Making robberies
into larcenies,
making rapes disappear--
you juke the stats
and majors become colonels.
I've been here before.
Wherever you go,
there you are.
Raven's got that
dude Mike Anderson.
He and Jamal
gonna be running...
Look at these runts. We're gonna go
when that football's in the air
on a long pass.
Slow?
Yeah.
Big yellow right here.
Yellows, yellows!
Go long. Go go.
Throw it high.
Big yellow.
Go.
- Narco!
- Oh, shit!
Po-po,
yo! Po-po!
- Where you going?
- Put me down, bitch!
They're in the alleys.
We get back in there,
we can hunt them up.
No need.
I know 'em all.
- Let me go, motherfucker!
- What about this one?
He isn't even bait.
We toss him back--
unless you want to
spend half the shift
down at baby booking.
Me:
I ain't afraid,
motherfucker!
I don't want to spend this shift
down at Evidence Control.
Then why the fuck
even do this?
So's I can talk to them.
I like to think that until
the handcuffs actually fit,
there's still talking
to be done.
Come here, man.
Let's take a walk.
You shut the fuck up.
Yo, who we listening to?
Miss Lady Day,
Billie Holliday.
Yeah, she sounds good.
You know, real sad,
kind of.
Yeah. I'm like that.
You be thinking
I'm all ghetto,
and then I flip it and
mess your mind all up.
The next time we
do this, Mr. Colvin,
could you please
make it on the weekend?
I only had,
like, three hours
between school
and now to get ready.
Well, you look
fine, Zenobia.
I could look better.
How long you think it take
to do hair like this?
I'm ordering the biggest
quarter-pounder. Fries, too.
Nigger,
this ain't Mickey D's.
You better be thinking
T-bone steak, medium rare.
The blood
all squirting out?
Nah, ain't no blood.
What you think rare is?
It mean rarely cooked,
hardly cooked?
Rare.
Get the blood out, stupid.
See?
And medium rare,
keep the blood in.
All right. Look.
All I want to know
which is which
before I order
some undone meat.
- Hey, Mr. Colvin.
- Huh?
How it work:
Look, we're just
gonna ask the waiter. All right?
Oh, shit.
There's a waiter?
Just right
down the block.
Where she at, dawg?
Ain't seen her.
She owe me.
All that shit I gave her.
Yeah, I know.
I don't know.
How you not know?
I don't know.
She let me find her,
I'm gonna cut her titty off.
Watch.
You got something
to say, nigger?
No no.
Yo, where Herc at?
I got the asshole, okay?
Tell him Riggs and Calhoun.
He knows. He knows.
Okay.
Get the fuck back here.
Nigger, I will fuck you up.
You don't know Lex?
I knew the Bull.
I mean, I know him.
But he ain't been
around though.
You see? Right there.
You just fucked up.
You said you "knew" him,
like you knew he was dead.
No. Now you putting
words in my mouth.
I meant, "knew him."
When he was around,
I knew him. But he left.
Herc.
Bubbles called.
He sees the guy--
the asshole.
He's on Riggs
and Calhoun.
Says he'll
hold him there
five minutes for you
to get across town.
I'm in the middle
of an interview here.
What the fuck?
Tell him we'll fix
his problem tomorrow.
All right?
Oh, motherfucker.
He ain't got a phone.
You lied to me
out on the street.
Why should l
believe you now?
You was there
when Lex got killed.
You part of the
fucking setup.
We know 'cause we have a witness
who put you right in there.
Yeah, we do.
You know right
where that body is.
You were there with Snoop,
Chris, whoever else.
Know how to make
an interrogation work?
Leverage.
We don't have leverage?
Motherfucker,
you don't even got a body.
Lex is nothing
but a name in there.
Where the fuck
you think you're going?
You ain't going nowhere.
Hey.
Hello!
Home Depot here!
Home Depot!
What you got
for me tonight?
I've been missing you
all day long, dawg.
No no. We done with this right here.
We done with this.
Say what? Don't play, man.
I ain't got time for your shit.
My shit's all you're
gonna get, all right?
You can kiss my ass, all the
fucking trouble you given me.
Oh, hey.
What you looking for, huh?
It's not there.
It's on me, all right?
It's on you?
Yeah.
- It's on you?
- Wait wait wait!
Oh, no no no!
Get off me!
Get off me!
Come on! Get off!
Hey, wait wait wait!
You take it!
Take it!
I got you now!
No no no!
Like that:
Fuck!
I don't like the orange ones.
Listen to me, fuckhead.
We know you were there.
We know you set him up,
and we know you didn't
do it alone.
Say what?
You weren't alone in this.
We know that.
You mean Randy?
I'm asking you
questions, remember?
If you don't give us
this murder, Kevin,
somebody else will.
And when they do,
they'll be putting you in.
You hear me?
Colvin, party of four.
I'll make sure
your table's ready.
"Colvin, party of four," huh?
Hi. May I take your coat?
Sure.
You, sir?
Oh, no.
I'm good.
Yeah, me too.
Okay, your table's ready.
Follow me, please.
Sir?
That's your chair, right?
No.
You sit there.
The waitress
will be here soon
to detail the specials
of the day.
Enjoy.
Thank you.
Waitress?
Who was that?
That's the, uh, hostess.
Hey, you ain't
gotta worry, Mr. C.
I ain't gonna
run up your bill.
I'll just get
whatever's on special.
It ain't no K-Mart
Blue Light Special, dumbass.
Special just mean they
cook something different.
Yo, what about you,
drinking without a straw,
all ghetto and shit?
You don't drink water
with a straw.
And put that on
your lap, fool.
You see anybody
else up in here
Iooking all
Fred Flintstone
and shit?
Shh.
Shut it down.
Other people
be looking at us.
Hello. My name is Pam.
I'd like to tell you about
our specials for the day.
We have king salmon
with sweet corn,
chanterelles
and basil aioli;
sauteed free-range chicken
served with mashed potatoes;
fresh Chesapeake Bay blue crab,
roasted garlic, shallot cream
and hen-of-the-woods
mushrooms;
and wood-oven-roasted
quail
with grilled bread salad.
Dang, I thought
y'all had steak.
Oh, we do...
on the second page
of your menus.
May I get your drink orders?
Yeah.
We'll take four cokes, please.
Right away.
Thank you.
Do you mind
if I come tomorrow?
Mind:
I--
You wouldn't
be embarrassed?
No, not at all.
I mean...
I'll be proud
if you're there.
It's funny
how it works out.
All those years I'm trying
to climb the ladder,
kissing ass, covering ass,
doing what I'm told.
I finally let some of it out,
tell 'em what I really think,
and I'm going from
lieutenant to colonel
in a little more than a year.
And, you, you're worried sick
about those subpoenas
and worried that Lester's
killing you with your boss--
But the subpoenas
get me promoted.
I know.
You know, Marlo
once said to me,
"You cannot lose if
you do not play."
But here we are, right?
Maybe it's changing.
What is?
The city, the way
things work or don't.
Maybe we're turning
a corner here
and it's not gonna be so
unbelievably fucked up anymore.
To Carcetti.
And us.
Zenobia,
you want to take a picture
of the restaurant, right?
That's okay.
It's late.
No no. That's fine.
Come on. Give
me the camera.
I'm okay.
Come on, give
me the camera.
Okay.
Y'all want to be in
the picture, right?
Yo, Mr. C, can
we stop at McDonald's?
- Fuck wrong with you, boy?
- Food wasn't right.
Don't like fish.
Why'd you order it, then?
Yo, shut the fuck up.
- Turn it down.
- What?
Turn it down, Namond.
Turn it up?
All right, you got it.
Seriously, can we get
some fries at least?
Boy, you is pathetic.
Just 'cause you a girl do not
mean I won't fuck you all up.
You hear me?
Nigger, please.
Yeah, you keep
talking all of that shit.
No, you keep talking
all that shit.
- Must have forgot.
- No, I ain't forget shit.
- What I forget anyway?
- That I'm the man.
Okay.
So, what's
the first thing we do
when we respond
to a prompt?
Randy?
"According
to the text..."?
"According to the text."
That's good.
And how do we
end the answer?
Quenice?
- Huh?
- Come on.
I know you know this.
"The above-stated facts have
led me to conclude that..."
Right?
Okay.
So, let's try to read
the third paragraph.
I'll start it.
"Pythias makes a final plea
to the tyrant Dionysius
to return to his home
one last--" Calvin, pick it up.
"To return to his
home one last time
before his punishment.
He denies the request
until Damon inter..."
"lntercedes."
"...and offers his own life
until Pythias returns."
Good.
Who wants to guess what
"intercedes" means?
What about "plea"?
Okay.
What about the story, then?
How would you summarize it?
Duquan, give it a shot.
"According to the text..."
everybody's safe
in the end, right?
Okay.
Let's think this through.
"According to the text,
Damon offers his own life
on behalf of Pythias
so that he can return home
one last time.
The above-stated facts
have led me to conclude
that Damon values Pythias'
friendship and loyalty."
Any questions?
We want four of the raw.
275 large right there.
For four
it should be three.
I'm charging five a head on them New
York boys. That about the going rate.
Still want us
on that?
Nah, seems like they got
the message and went the fuck on.
True that.
Delroy has all of the
Monument Street corners back.
All right, then. Holler at us
when the next package in.
Uh, you remember when I told
you about the co-op meant
we all stand together,
doing for each
other when we can?
You remember that?
Well, the price of four raw
is 300.
And your work on them
New York boys
already been factored
into the price, you see?
On the other hand,
we got something that you want, and it's
coming back to you... free of charge.
Someone you looking for.
Co-op mean
what it sound like, dawg.
You happy to do for me,
I'm happy to do for you.
Congratulations,
Colonel.
Congratulations,
Deputy Commissioner.
Congratulations to all
those who were promoted,
their families, and friends.
It's a proud day for them
and a proud day for the
Baltimore Police Department.
I am so proud of you.
Oh, thank you.
You know, Valchek
we could have guessed.
I mean, he's
Carcetti's man, but...
Daniels:
Long time for you to make major,
but this was quick enough.
Yeah, who's your
new rabbi, huh?
Colonel.
So, they didn't
know the salad fork
from whatever the fuck
the other fork is for. So what?
I knew they'd be at a loss,
but the extent of it...
I'm talking
about feelings--
why they
feeling this...
this plummet from masters
of the universe to abject fear
to humiliated fury
and no awareness of it.
Who says
they're not aware?
Maybe they just
didn't acknowledge.
Either way. But my point is,
where do you start with them?
How you get them to
believe in themselves
if they can't even
admit their feelings
about who they are and what
they're doing in this world?
They're not fools.
They know exactly what
we expect them to be.
Y'all missed some meal
for real, though.
Take your seats.
It was hot, yo.
"Party of four,
Mr. Colvin."
"May I take your coat,
Mr. Brice?"
Ha!
That shit was tight.
I'm dreaming about
that chocolate cake.
Oh my God.
Shit had, like,
56 layers, yo!
"...in the check-room,
Mr. Colvin...
"D Money saves Pitman"?
It's bullshit!
Before, at least they were
getting something out of it.
To hell with my evaluation.
To hell with Donnelly,
to hell with the
statewide test scores.
I came here to teach.
Right?
Yo, Coach, seen Michael?
Nah.
All right.
That wasn't you
and your runts
I saw down on Bentlow
yesterday, slinging?
Right.
'Cause a gangster
like yourself
wouldn't set up such
a weak-ass shop
with no real lookouts,
ground stash in plain view.
This is me telling y'all
as plain as I can.
You guys had
your one chance.
I see you out there
a second time,
everyone takes a beating
and goes to Cheltenham.
Fair warning you just got.
Cheltenham for
some drug charges?
Please, man.
I'll write you up
as a special.
Don't think I won't do it.
Jab, jab! Good.
He don't think
I can jail?
Shit!
I can jail...
- What's up?
- Namond's banging, huh?
Yeah.
He's one of yours, right?
He hang around
the gym,
mostly waiting on
his boy Michael.
He don't box or nothing.
He ain't that kind, really.
Not like his father.
- Who was his father?
- Dude named Wee-Bey.
Stone-headed. Used to run
with them Barksdales.
I know him.
Shit, I locked him up
in Philadelphia.
Yeah?
Bey was my cut buddy.
We jailed down Jessup.
Anyway, Namond's from him.
Same blood,
but not the same heart.
I've done my
warm-ups, Coach.
Yeah. We ready
for the ring!
Take care, man.
Why we stopping here?
I thought we was
going straight out.
Gotta get with
your escort out.
Prop Joe said you
was my escort out.
Manner of speaking,
that be true.
Come on over here, man.
Come on.
Chris, no.
You know I keep
it quick, Dre.
- Here?
- Here's good.
Not-- not in a vacant.
What's the difference?
The difference
is my people.
They won't know.
They'll know.
But-- but-- but
the rats.
I'll be alone
with the rats.
You're all right.
I got your back.
Come on, Chris.
Let me do it in
my house so my people--
they can give me
a home go.
I'll be damned.
Que?
Hey, yo, that got
to be Marlo, man.
You see?
That's the man we robbed, yo,
from the poker game.
Ah...
si, si, si.
No wonder the boy
don't like me.
Hmmph.
Thought maybe I could
catch up with Chris.
I got a problem I can't
bring to no one else.
Quien es?
He just a kid.
You've got
to be shitting me.
Oh, shit!
Get out of the way!
- Driving all crazy.
- Damn.
16. I've got a foot chase
on a number-one male.
Maybe 13 years,
short, with braids,
in the alleys
eastbound from Fulton.
This kid has bailed out!
Bailed out!
Motherfucking fuck fuck
fuck fuck!
Officer, what
are you doing?
What, you need
bifocals or something?
What?
0-9. I'm responding.
16, 200 north.
I'm gonna need your name.
Listen. I'm very sorry,
ma'am, all right?
Give me the hat.
Nah, see, them Expeditions
are hard to handle.
But with a Lexus, man
I wouldn't have no problem.
You little motherfucker.
- You know how many cars you hit?
- What?
Don't even think
of bullshitting.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
You know what kind of fucking
paperwork I got now, huh?
You know how many hours
of my life you owe me, you little shit?
Damn, yo! That hurt!
You think that hurts...
No, no. Aah!
You're so smart,
- see how easy you boost a car now.
- Aah!
You imagine Rawls
sitting in this chair?
Never happen.
In this town: Uh-uh.
Yeah, well, we weren't supposed
to have a white mayor, either.
He already overreached
putting Rawls in charge.
De-fucking-facto.
Motherfucker ain't
even sworn in yet.
Already, he's got
feelers out.
I know for a fact he called
the deputy chief in Pittsburgh--
Friend of mine--
promised him pie in the sky.
Shi-it, partner.
All you got to do is show
Carcetti and everybody else
that they already got
the man for the job.
They ain't got
to look no further.
The indispensable man.
It was Royce
holding you back, Ervin.
Now out from under,
you shine.
Clay, he's saying everything
goes through Bill Rawls.
Any move I try to make--
You're still
the commissioner, ain't you?
You give an order,
they gonna jump.
- Yeah, but Carcetti--
- What he gonna do, fire you?
He just showed you
he don't have balls enough.
You just need to give
Carcetti a little something.
Make him start seeing
you in a new light.
Like what:
Some kind of police shit.
Hell, I don't know.
Something that
looks good to Carcetti,
so he can say it was his idea
to keep you all along.
Hmm.
Police shit:
Well, whatever it is
y'all do for a living.
Well-- just take care
of your end
and let your friends
handle theirs.
Good morning.
I just dropped my stuff
in my room,
and maintenance and Donnelly
are in there checking the heat.
It must be
80 degrees in there.
90-minute classes.
Excuse me:
This time of the year,
we go to 90-minute classes.
Concentrated prep in math
and language arts only.
I don't follow.
Why the heat?
It's the only way the kids will
sit through 90 minutes of anything.
- Make them drowsy?
- Right.
So it's about the tests.
From now until they're done,
everything's about the tests.
Damn!
I ought to go somewhere
warm for the winter.
Where?
I saw on "Animal Planet"
marlin fishing--
Iike, Florida,
the Bahamas.
That shit looked sweet.
The water was like this...
this color, man.
Man, it ain't gonna be
that cold this year.
- How you know?
- Global warming.
So why is it so cold already?
Yo, we just getting old.
Yeah. True that.
Yo. Where the fuck you been?
City jail
for a day and a half
till they recogged me.
Then my grandma got sick,
so I was over there for a while.
Po-Po hit you
with a charge, huh?
Just a humble--
false statement and shit,
for saying I wasn't
who I really was.
Damn, so why they was
asking about you like that?
Hmm-mmm.
They try talking to you?
Yeah, about some murder.
- Which one?
- It don't matter which murder
because I didn't say shit
to them bitches, though.
Yeah, well, I ain't the one
you need to convince.
Why I got to convince him?
You know, I'm saying, yo.
Po-Po come asking about you,
they snatch your ass up,
you out of pocket
for a few days.
Heh! Oh, yeah.
He'll definitely hear about it.
I didn't say nothing
to nobody.
That's why they
gave me the humble,
dumped my ass
in Central Booking,
because I ain't say
a fucking word to none of them.
Yeah, so go tell him
that shit.
Shit, man, if it were me,
I'd go to him first.
Yeah, Kev, you know, definitely
jump out in front of that, man,
because if they got
to come looking for you,
it's gonna look like
you got something to hide.
- Definitely.
- Got that "Plymouth Rock" over here.
Ghetto bird special.
Two for one...
What you want?
- Menu, yo. Give him a menu.
- Oh.
- What's good?
- Fuck if I know.
You ain't supposed to cuss
at the customer, motherfucker.
Kwame. Darnell.
All right.
Let me get... pizza.
Pizza. Anything to drink?
Grape soda.
Quiet, please.
- Is that it?
- Yeah.
Thank you. Say thank you.
Yeah. Thank you.
Menu:
Don't he got to say
"thank you," too?
Darnell.
What the fuck for?
He's supposed to give it back.
Because when you are polite
to people, they treat you better.
- Have a seat, please.
- May I see you?
Now you try being the waiter,
and Albert, be the customer.
What you want to eat?
Give me some crab cakes
and a coke.
Hurry that shit up, too.
Been on the phone
nonstop with Fourth Avenue.
They're insisting every class
teaches to the test.
Oh, God.
Look. I thought
we were the exception.
I mean, that's the point
of the project.
- They know that.
- No exceptions.
And 90-minute blocks of math
or language arts only.
This class:
Kids can't do 30 minutes
without climbing the walls.
Look. Isn't there somebody
we can sit down and talk with,
face to face?
Actually, that's the second thing
they told me.
The area superintendent wants to see
the two of you tomorrow morning,
9:00 in the conference room.
Let's not panic... yet.
Business as usual.
Marlo.
You no know him
when we robbed the game?
He ain't that bad a deuce.
Boy's merely a name to me.
If you knew it was Marlo,
you'd still
go through with it, no?
I wish I'd have known. I'd
have enjoyed it that much more.
Bubs.
It's Herc. You hungry?
Yo, what you done
was fucked up, man.
You don't know how bad
I felt when I heard.
I mean, not only
were you late,
you just rolled right past.
Ain't you see me getting beat?
We rolled by?
I seen you with
the blue light on, man.
Whatever. Look, we had
a communication problem, I admit.
But I'm gonna
get you a phone today,
and that's gonna
solve it for us.
You'll see.
Thing is,
there's this camera--
police department video camera
disappeared a few weeks back.
And for various reasons
that I can't get into,
I got to get it back somehow.
Camera?
Yeah. This fella Marlo
probably took it.
I don't know if he
hocked it or if he--
You're bothering me
about a camera?
You supposed to have
my back, remember?
Five minutes, you told me.
I know. I owe on the deal.
It's Tyrone's, chicken wings.
Here's the thing.
I want you
to put it out there
that there's a $500 bounty
on this camera if it comes back.
No questions asked.
500?
Swear to God. I'm good for it--
if it's the right camera.
Here's the model
and serial number.
So it's 500 for the camera and
a chicken box for Bubs, huh?
It's another 100
to you if this happens.
But I need this camera quick,
or shit's gonna fly.
Look, man,
I told you, it's not about
the money for me right now.
All right?
This motherfucker,
he messing with
my livelihood here.
They're always
coming back, always.
He's like some
"Terminator" and shit.
I'm with you.
I'm gonna do everything I can
to help you out with your problem,
and you're gonna help
me out with mine.
Who the fuck is Randy?
He's a little hopper
from around the way.
He ain't in the game, but he
be with Michael and them.
And he talking to police?
I know it.
I know he did,
because he was the one I told, "Go
tell Lex to go up to the alley.
Patrice is waiting."
You were supposed to do that.
Yeah, I know, but this way,
try to keep some distance
between me and Lex, right?
You tell this Randy
what happened to Lex?
No, I swear it.
Go, motherfucker.
The fuck you still waiting for?
- What the fuck y'all following me for?
- Easy, son.
No. Ain't nobody
walking with me nowhere.
What's up with this Randy?
He can't hurt us.
- He a snitch, though.
- Yeah. Put that around, then.
- Slim.
- Marlo.
- How you feeling?
- Can't complain, yo.
Getting to be
that time, though.
Joe wanted me
to check in, you know?
All right. Pull up
a chair. Let's chop it up.
Now, that there
a Barksdale boy.
So?
Don't add up.
Interesting, though.
Got a burner, see?
If anything else
comes up, you call me.
If this guy robs you again, make sure
he's holding. The more, the better.
Shit, I ain't got
money for all that.
There's 40 minutes on that,
and my number's
in there already.
Watch. I'm gonna call you
today or tomorrow at the latest.
One and one.
Damn, son.
He did a number on you.
Who was it?
Officer Walker.
Walker be evil.
- What up?
- Four.
Yeah, we ought
to fuck him up.
Walker? Yo, he the police.
I'm just saying.
He said next time
I steal a car,
I'm gonna find myself dead.
You gonna do as he say?
Fuck no.
Soon as I get this shit off,
I'll be running his ass
all over town.
Yo, shit!
Told you, Namond.
Gave you fair warning, didn't l?
- I ain't done nothing.
- Get the cash. Got you cold.
Shit, with hair like that, I could
make you from East Baltimore.
- Get the fuck off of me, man.
- Shut up!
- Look what I found.
- That ain't fucking mine!
Hands on the car!
Spread your legs.
- I ain't fucking got--
- Shut up!
How you like it
so far? Having fun?
Guess what?
Gets better.
Give me your hands.
Watch your head.
Damn. Y'all not
wasting any time, huh?
Nerese was
good enough to let us
stage in the council suite
till the inauguration.
No doubt after your fine
showing in the general.
- No doubt.
- 81%?
82. In a city where Democrats
outnumber Republicans nine to one--
Anything less would have
been an embarrassment.
So...
what can we do
for you, Senator?
Well, first of all,
I wanted to clear the air.
If there are any hard feelings
over what happened
during the primary--
You gonna give
the money back?
Senator, it's been
a very long day.
I'll cut to the chase.
I understand
you have a problem
at the top of
the police department.
You asked Burrell
to resign. He declined.
I'm looking
for a replacement.
The ministers like Burrell.
So does the council president.
We're confident that when we
identify a suitable candidate,
Ms. Campbell and the ministers will see
the wisdom of new leadership.
Except y'all need to get a
pay raise through the city council.
Pay raise would help.
I can ask Nerese about
that pay raise getting passed,
maybe convince
some of the ministers
they need to move on
from Burrell.
Situation would have to be resolved
sooner rather than later.
Do my best, partner.
And what do we do
for you in return?
I'm in Annapolis.
Word I'm hearing,
you may be there too,
in a couple of years.
We may find ourselves
working together closely.
Thanks for your time.
Jesus Christ.
He's slick.
Apologizes for the short con,
and then in the next breath
setting us up for the long.
He and Burrell are
as thick as thieves.
And do we know
what the long con is?
At least we know
he's running one.
Shiiiii...
Try calling again.
Man, I know she not
gonna answer.
My moms don't answer
when she go to A.C.
When she coming back?
She going to New York after.
What's she doing in New York?
Shopping.
Going to see some show,
"The Color Purple."
See, now this is where
my job gets good.
You could reach a guardian, we both know
the juvenile master's gonna recog you
on a first-time drug arrest.
But now you'd better have
a toothbrush on you, son,
because it's gonna be
baby booking tonight.
Namond, you scared?
I mean, if it was Cheltenham,
I don't blame you,
but baby booking's
just across town.
The East Side be beefing
with the West Side in there.
There's some dudes
be getting raped and shit.
I mean, that's
what I be hearing.
It's bad in there.
I don't know if it's that bad.
Well, I hear different.
You got no other family?
I got a aunt
down in P.G. County.
You got a number?
Well, I ain't driving you
this late, anyway, so--
Come on, man.
Tell you what:
two of my guys
are working a double,
working midnight shift
tonight.
If you can plant yourself
on that bench over there,
you can stay here
for the night.
But first thing tomorrow,
you got to raise that aunt
or raise your moms,
or I got to process you.
You don't move
off that bench.
You need the bathroom,
you go now.
Otherwise, just...
sit tight,
don't give anybody
any trouble,
or they'll process you
right then and there.
I'm cool. Thanks.
Fucking charity ward here.
I'll go tell
the shift commander.
Yo, Lieutenant...
He a 50:
No. Probably copping
it for my moms.
That's why?
Look. I told y'all,
I just want him gone.
I just want him away
from me and Bug.
The fuck he do to you?
All right.
We'll take care of it, boss.
Another church burglary
in sector two last night.
Madison Park Methodist.
This would be what
you'd call a rash.
And we could use
some ointment.
We need to arrest these fucks.
We getting anywhere on that?
Not yet.
Who caught the last one?
McNulty?
- Working it. We should talk.
- All right.
Speaking of arrests, word from
on high is to sweep corners.
They want arrests to double
over the next month.
How the fuck how:
Jesus, I thought
the election was over.
Bosses want quality-of-life
violations.
What are we talking about,
Lieutenant, loitering?
Disorderlies,
public indecency.
Oh, this is horseshit.
- Broken-windows theory.
- Worked in New York.
Case you ain't noticed,
this ain't New York.
But it could work here.
- Never has.
- Never been done right.
Open containers, too.
- What's wrong with writing a ticket?
- More of that, too.
The word is, the commissioner
himself wants to juke arrests.
Open container used to be
sacrosanct in this town.
Long as it was in a paper bag.
They gave you
that much respect.
Man's beverage
was his business.
You took them
to a restaurant?
Yeah. Ruth Chris.
Linen napkins.
Yeah. Silverware,
more than one fork.
How'd they do?
Eh, pretty well, considering.
Did they embarrass us?
Us? No, uh...
we're fine with it,
but, uh...
I mean, they were
intimidated, embarrassed,
and awkward as hell,
but they made it through.
Ms. Shepherdson,
these aren't the kids
that are gonna be able to sit
still for the statewide tests,
much less do well on them.
These were the kids
that were gonna make it impossible
for anyone else to do well.
So we're writing them off?
No, that's what
we're not doing.
You're not educating them.
You're socializing them.
They weren't being educated before.
There's no point in being obtuse.
- Excuse me:
- Hold on. Hold on.
Look. What he's
saying is this:
I mean, you put a textbook
in front of these kids,
put a problem
on a blackboard,
or teach them every problem
on some statewide test,
it won't matter, none of it,
because they're not learning for
our world, they're learning for theirs.
And they know exactly
what it is they're training for
and what it is everyone
expects them to be.
I expect them to be students.
But it's not about you or us,
or the tests or the system.
It's what they expect
of themselves.
I mean, every single one of them
know they headed back to the corners.
Their brothers and sisters--
shit, their parents--
they came through these same
classrooms, didn't they?
We pretended to teach them,
they pretended to learn,
and where--
where'd they end up?
Same damn corners.
I mean, they're
not fools, these kids.
They don't know our world,
but they know their own.
I mean, Jesus, they--
they see right through us.
I think we made that clear
when you approved the project.
Provisionally approved.
When you provisionally
approved the project,
we made it clear that we
would be addressing children
that required socialization
before they could be
properly educated.
We can't lie.
Not to them.
Captain, line three.
Roll call's over.
You get a line
on your mother yet?
Fucking neglect case
here, I want it.
How about that aunt:
Ain't nobody else you know?
No other responsible adult?
Like who:
I don't know.
I'm just trying to give you
one last shot here
because once I go
on the street today,
you're gonna
have to go to booking.
I got a teacher.
Mr. Colvin.
You know him?
He used to be police.
Tall: Bald:
Yeah.
Yeah, I know him.
What if you
get the one snitch?
The one with the cart.
What's his name?
Bubbles.
Bubbles. Yeah.
You get Bubbles to say
he's Fuzzy Dunlop.
Except Bubbles has been
a registered Cl for years.
Kima gave him a number back
when she was in plainclothes, man.
And, Herc, you worked
with him under that number
on the Barksdale stuff.
So how would you
fuck up the lD?
Fuck me, man.
Look. The only way
to get out from under this
is to stop fucking lying, okay:
You grab your dick,
you walk into Marimow's office,
and you say,
"Lieutenant, I made a mistake.
"l attributed
my PC to an informant
when in fact I had
it off a camera."
That I got from lSD without going
through the proper channels.
No no no.
He's gonna take
my stripes on this.
Maybe he does, but if you wait until lSD
comes looking for that camera
and he figures out
the lie for himself,
he takes your fucking balls.
Come on!
Let's go!
Around the corner.
Got you now, motherfucker.
In going over
some of my paperwork,
it occurs to me
I may have been neglectful.
Look at all this crap!
Every day,
more and more of Lester Freamon's
bullshit washes up with us.
What the fuck are you saying?
That my paperwork
may have been a little sloppy,
and as a result,
I confused myself
on some things.
No shit, you were sloppy.
I actually went back a couple
weeks on your run sheets.
Nothing there references
a meet with a Cl 238.
You went through
all my run sheets?
The best I could.
Sir, listen--
I don't care who it is.
Turn that fucking thing off.
I am starting to believe
that this Fuzzy fella
doesn't exist.
I am starting to believe
that you just followed
Stanfield into the train station
and grabbed the first broad
he brushed up against.
- That what happened?
- No. No, sir.
You lie to me now, Sergeant,
and I guaran-fucking-tee you
I will jam you up,
ship this whole mess to llD
and be there to pass out
sandwiches at your execution.
Yes, sir.
You haven't brought me
a case yet worth talking about,
not on Marlo Stanfield,
not on anyone.
You bring me something
other than llD complaints,
and I might have some reason
to let a few things slide.
Mad at me:
Come on, now.
Dukie's just mad
at everybody.
Ha ha ha!
Snitch bitch.
Yo, what the fuck was that?
I don't know.
I can't believe
y'all are doing this shit.
You're degrading the quality
of life in this neighborhood.
Malt liquor.
Oh, come on, man!
Brother, you got to
shake hands with a pilsner,
maybe a nice tail ale.
Hell, what-- oh, man!
My brew!
My shoes!
God! Man.
What's the violation?
Parking in a bus stop,
expired registration.
First-class
police work, Baker.
Yeah, well, this is
the word from up on high,
straight from the eighth
floor downtown.
Blessed bosses juking stats
for the new administration.
I know you think
it's bullshit,
but I spend my shift
where they tell me.
Baker, let me tell you
a little secret:
A patrolling officer
on his beat
is the one true
dictatorship in America.
We can lock a guy up
on a humble;
we can lock him up for real;
or we can say, fuck it--
pull under the expressway
and drink ourselves to death,
and our side partners
will cover it.
So no one-- and I mean no one--
tells us how to waste our shift.
Pulled the reports
on those church burglaries.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. There's a pattern.
Times and locations.
They're working west by northwest
through Sandtown-Winchester.
The last three--
here, here, and here--
these ones in blue are
the churches they haven't hit
closest to the ones
they have.
You got all this
from the incident reports?
That's why we do
the paperwork.
Giving me a motherfucking
ticket, man?
Are you out of
your motherfucking mind?
I live here, man!
This could get out of hand.
That's what we want,
isn't it? More arrests?
Come on.
No justice, no peace.
It'll only be for tonight.
Mama gets back from
New York tomorrow.
Your call.
The young man seems to
think highly of you, boss.
He invoked your name
with a measure of respect.
It wasn't but
a few weeks ago
I was in a room with him being
called everything but a child of God.
"Mr. Colvin, sir.
Fuck you."
Yeah, well, at least
I said, "Mr."
So what was the charge?
Slinging.
He'd been out there
a few weeks or so.
First pop,
second warning from me.
Maybe you should put him
on the juvenile bus.
He wants so bad
to be a gangster,
maybe it's time he get a taste of what
a real lockup's all about, you know?
Come on, Mr. C.,
don't do me like that.
I made him sleep on
the DEU bench last night,
if that counts for anything.
Isn't there anybody else?
Friend, relative, anybody?
You've always been good
with the knuckleheads, boss.
Ahh. All right.
Let me go call my wife.
Yeah. Go up
in that building.
Mmm, man,
that was delicious.
There's more.
Uh, no, ma'am.
Saving room for the cobbler.
A la mode?
Huh:
Would you like
ice cream on it?
Oh! Oh, yes, ma'am.
Nice manners.
From what you told me
on the phone, Bunny,
I was expecting
more of an adventure.
Bunny?
Only my friends
call me Bunny.
- Yeah, but why?
- You don't need to know.
And if you tell anybody,
I'll cut your balls off.
I'll cut them off, give 'em
to Donnelly in a jar.
Don't doubt me, boy.
You ain't got no kids?
Grown. They're at
college and past that.
You told me
these kids were rough.
Thank you, sweetie.
But don't be fooled.
This is his
Eddie Haskell act.
Eddie Haskell?
Who that?
You are, son. Trust me.
Take a seat.
Put yours against
the wall with the others.
Welcome wagon's on
their way back from booking.
- We need the key to the interview room.
- What the fuck for?
Felony burglary.
Felony?
Caught them coming
out of St. Martin's on Fulton.
Charging them with the one,
but we might work back
on a few more.
No shit:
Fucking knew there was still
some real criminals left in Baltimore.
Swear to God, I'm seeing
citations for jaywalking.
We're locking people up
for open container,
for disorderly,
for loitering.
The neighborhood people,
sometimes they appreciate
quality-of-life arrests.
Except we're locking up
the neighborhood people.
Some of my guys,
all they see are the stats.
I mean, the election's
fucking over, right?
Who are we doing this for?
Is this coming
from Burrell or Rawls?
We got it from
the chief of patrol.
It's rolling
downhill, for sure.
Morale:
Split down
the middle, I'd say.
The officers that love
the stat are jazzed.
The rest of them:
We don't know where to turn.
I thought a new hump as mayor
might change this shit,
not ramp it up.
Hey, you still
fucking that bitch?
Yeah. It burning
like hell, man.
When you gonna burn
the bitch back? Oh, check it.
Slim.
B. What up:
All right.
- Poot.
- It's good.
- Heard you're out.
- Yeah.
- Welcome home.
- Thanks, dawg.
And you with Prop Joe now.
Never would have thought.
Yeah, well, life's strange.
Yeah. Holler.
Bodie... how you and Marlo?
You okay with him?
As far as I know, yeah. Why?
What he did to your boy.
What boy are you talking?
Big boy,
the one rub his hands
together all the time?
Kevin: What about him:
You ain't heard?
Chris and Snoop walked
him down an alley.
He in a vacant now.
How you know that?
I seen them lay
hands on the boy.
And now the word out
on the street.
Sorry, dawg.
Let's roll.
Plymouth Rock.
Got that Plymouth Rock.
All right.
But now look at the next
example question on page 20.
As you can see...
if you turn to page 20,
they will sometimes ask you
for words that are the opposite
of words that are underlined.
Uh, thank you,
Mr. Pryzbylewski.
Thank you.
All right, put away
your test notebooks.
Work on those tomorrow.
We have, uh,
45 minutes left.
We can do
"Last of the Mohicans"--
- No!
- No!
Or practice probabilities.
- Yeah.
- Yes.
- I'll get the stuff, Mr. Prezbo.
- All right.
And I want to see
everybody's worksheets out.
Hey, Kareem, you want
to play dice with me?
Not with you.
And we're not just
playing games here.
We're doing math.
I'll roll with you, man.
Come on.
No kidding.
We are.
That's my boy
resting his head, see?
Mmm.
Hey, Renaldo,
you want one?
No.
They're from Faidley's, yo.
He might stay home
all day, you know?
We gonna find out, ain't we?
- Like to see about my DSS code.
- Do you have an appointment?
Why I need an appointment?
Zenobia, I don't think
she needs an appointment.
Sorry, just trying
to make it realistic.
So I get to see somebody?
You're gonna have to
take a number and wait.
I need to see
somebody right now.
Don't get angry. Anger doesn't help.
It just makes people defensive.
Tell her what you need calmly.
- Card didn't come this month.
- We mailed it.
- Maybe it got stolen.
- Heh. Sorry. Nothing we can do.
- Fuck you.
- Chandra!
- She ain't helping me.
- That's how they do.
Just tell her what you need.
- Need another card, bitch.
- Chandra.
And that's reality.
Fuck you for real.
- Oh!
- Oh!
Calm down.
Calm down.
Go with Ms. Mason.
- Get your hands off!
- Ms. Mason!
I'll get the school police.
She was like...
And then-- and then--
and then she was like...
Typical day?
I wouldn't know.
My first time.
Your first time?
Mrs. Donnelly
oversees this project.
Okay.
Good morning, ladies.
Help a man get
something to eat?
God bless.
Good morning, Reverend.
Yo.
Glad you finally answered.
Yeah, I was in
a meeting yesterday.
You got the asshole
pinned down?
Nah, I got Marlo's people--
getting ready to make a drop.
- Where?
- Edmondson, near Pulaski.
You eyeballing
them right now?
Yeah, he got the package.
Black bag, putting it
in the trunk.
- He getting in right now.
- What make?
Late model Lincoln.
You want the license?
- Yeah, give it.
- P-R-8-Z-G-O-D.
Yeah. Yeah, he pulling out now,
turning down Gilmore.
Dozerman,
get me Foxtrot.
Good job, Bubs.
We're on it.
Ladies, a cell phone?
It's got, like, a half hour on it.
No thank you.
What I saw today
wasn't education
as I understand the term,
and they didn't seem
very socialized, either.
You didn't catch us
on our best day.
Or your worst day?
On the whole, they've
actually made a lot of progress.
Look, I mean,
they come to class,
they're more engaged.
We're reaching them.
Fewer outbursts,
no suspensions.
But are they really
learning anything?
Yes. We believe they are.
Be truthful.
If this program
were to continue
through the rest
of the school year,
how many of your students
could realistically
be expected to return
to a regular classroom?
What do you think,
Ms. Duquette?
Namond, Darnell,
maybe Zenobia.
Yeah, look. I mean,
considering where we started
and considering
that those kids
ain't out there
tearing up other classes--
Okay. Mrs. Donnelly.
A tremendous achievement.
Mr. Withers:
I'll go along
with Mrs. Donnelly.
You haven't said anything yet.
I just don't see it.
Many of these kids
are profoundly damaged--
what they've seen,
how they've lived.
And I think any gain
or progress is temporary.
I think this project
may be flawed.
Foxtrot 23-30.
We have a visual
on the suspect.
Vehicle headed east
on Mulberry. Do you copy?
- 10-4. We're almost there.
- 10-4.
After your phone call,
I checked.
It came directly from Burrell.
He bypassed Rawls after l
specifically told him he was--
Burrell's making a play
for you to keep him.
By, uh, just--
what did you call that?
Juking the stats.
Guy is unbelievable.
It runs completely counter to
all my discussions with Rawls,
with you, with everyone.
He's also serving notice.
He's reasserting control
of the department.
He probably figures if you can't
fire him, then you can't fire him.
And does Rawls know?
My guess is, Rawls
heard about it days ago
from half a dozen
district commanders.
Why wouldn't
he come to me?
Talk to him.
Why did you come to me?
I mean, why not go to Rawls?
Because I need to know
if you're serious.
If Rawls already came to you
and this shit is still going on,
then you're okay with it,
which is for me a problem.
If he didn't come to you,
then either he's okay with it,
which is also a problem,
or he's letting it go,
trying give Burrell enough rope
for you to get angry and
fire the man for insubordination.
But I need to know
where you stand.
Well, I gave you my word.
Yes. You did.
Well, thanks for going outside
the chain of command.
Don't expect me
to make a habit of it.
Stay in the car!
Stay in the car.
Keep your hands on the wheel.
- Let's see those hands.
- What's the problem, Officer?
Step slowly out of the vehicle.
Keep your hands up.
Son, be gentler than that.
Shut the fuck up.
I ain't your son.
This guy...
What's this, huh?
What's this?
Do you know what? I'm gonna damn
sure get your name and badge number.
Daniels. I don't
think I know him.
Oh, he hasn't
played much politics,
though he used to be married to
the new councilwoman in the 11th.
- Marla Daniels:
- Mm-hmm. That's the one.
This is the last man we want
as police commissioner, Nerese.
I mean, I squared off against
this fellow a few years back,
and he wouldn't
listen to me.
He's not gonna listen
to you or the ministers
or anyone else
in the community.
- Just Carcetti?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, he's the mayor's boy,
definitely.
Carcetti is looking
for how much of a salary bump?
50,000, at least,
to make the position
competitive nationally.
Give him 25.
It'll be enough to make him
think he'll win you over eventually
but less than he needs
to entice anyone real.
Meanwhile, Carcetti's gonna
have to give Daniels
six months in ClD
before he can bump him again,
for appearance's sake.
So we're buying time here.
Enough for Ervin to show the
new mayor who butters the bread.
And for events to take the
new-penny shine off Cedric Daniels.
I happen to know he's less
the saint than he pretends to be.
This is Senator Davis.
Is the Mayor in at the moment?
Well...you just tell him
his friend Clay
got the council president to un-ass a
salary bump for the police commissioner.
You tell him...
write this down, now.
You tell him that Senator Davis
has his interests at heart.
Right.
Thanks.
Hey, Ma. How was New York?
Hey, Ms. Brice.
How are you?
Who asking?
This is my teacher, Mom--
Mr. Colvin.
Why he here?
You in trouble?
He stayed at our house
last night,
with you being
in New York and all.
Tell her.
The cops picked me up,
saying I was slinging.
They was gonna send me
to baby booking.
But we took him in.
You leave my son
the fuck alone.
And you, you afraid
to go to baby booking?
The fuck is wrong with you, boy?
Get in the damn house!
Kid got the point.
all these drunk and disorderlies
and squeegee boys,
graffiti artists,
and public urinators,
and here we come in with
a pair of felony burglaries.
Nice of you to give him
the collar.
Well, he might turn out
a decent police.
Got to come from somewhere.
Young generation.
- Uh-huh.
- What about you guys?
You gonna follow
in your dad's footsteps?
Hello, I don't think so.
- Not.
- What, then?
- Video game designer.
- Rock star.
- Ahh.
- Ah, they want to make money.
- You schooled them well.
- How about you, Little Bunk?
You'll be a detective
like your daddy?
- Chief of police.
- Nah.
Why not? How about you?
Oh, he's still in that, you know,
pediatric neurosurgeon stage.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Hey! Elena,
how are you doing?
I'm good.
How are you?
Can't complain.
Hey, boys.
How are you?
Can you say hi?
Listen. They're fine.
They really do have manners.
It's all right.
My kids are the same way.
We're just finishing up.
Please sit down.
Oh-- okay.
Just for a minute.
Dad, five bucks
for the jukebox?
What? What happened to
three plays for a quarter?
Um... homework?
- Done, Dad helped us.
- Oh.
I got off early. Here.
You want to go, too?
So what are you drinking?
I'll have a white wine.
Mmm:
I'm good, thanks.
So it's true?
You quit drinking?
Well, I have a beer
now and again.
No big deal.
How's Dennis:
Dennis is... Dennis.
We're close, we're not.
You know, we'll see.
- How's Beadie?
- We're good.
The kids have my number, but...
Mmm.
Wow.
If I had known you were gonna
grow up to be a grownup...
Pssh, man.
And I'm the one that told
him to do the right thing
and go talk to the man.
It don't seem
that way now, do it?
I mean, yo, you got to look at
it from Marlo's point of view.
I mean, how this
different from Wallace?
Because Stringer said
Wallace snitched.
Yo. Kevin might have
snitched too.
- Man, but he didn't.
- And we had to do Wallace!
Yo, Marlo thought
he had to do Kevin.
- Man.
- But he didn't.
That's what I'm saying.
He's a cold motherfucker.
It's a cold world, Bodie.
Thought you said
it was getting warmer, nigger.
World going one way,
people another, yo.
Now, Elton Brand--
what you know about him?
Nothing. You see?
Bug, you seen your daddy?
Went to the store.
Where you going?
I'm gonna look for him.
You ain't gonna find him.
Why not?
Because he ain't coming back.
Thanks.
- What's this about?
- Like you don't know.
Man, I ain't been home long enough
to get in somebody's shit.
You like boys,
motherfucker?
What?
Boys. You like
fucking them?
Man, I like pussy.
All right? Booty.
Living with
a woman now.
She got kids?
I ain't touch them kids!
Who told you that?
I know what
you're saying,
but when you're on the inside,
ain't no pussy.
Well, yeah, shit.
You've been inside.
Man got to bust his nut,
know what I'm saying?
I do.
Damn.
You didn't even wait to get
the motherfucker in the house.
Uh, yeah...
can I get the mixed
vegetables and white rice?
Okay, mixed vegetables,
white rice.
Damn, Du'.
You actin' like this
some fancy-ass spot.
It ain't nothing
but a Chink joint.
I'm-a order.
Then do it.
I said I got it.
Look at this nigger
flashin' his shit
Iike some big-time
gangster.
Yeah, Na'
a righteous hustler.
Man, I'm just treating
y'all, that's all.
You know I like to keep it
real with the little people.
Man, fuck you, man.
- I was talking about you.
- I was talking about you.
May I help you?
Can I order the yakame
with turkey grease?
Yakame, noodles--
- This nigger ordered turkey grease.
- What's wrong, yo?
I mean, my mom,
she get it all the time.
Yo, you is really one of
them at-risk children,
- you know that, Dukie?
- Yo, man, leave him alone, son.
Yeah, I got it.
How much?
- $4.00.
- Why is it so funny?
They just
goofin' on you.
What's wrong with
me ordering yakame?
Nothing wrong with
you ordering yakame.
It's just the turkey grease
that makes the drunks,
you know, throw up all that
liquor they was drinking,
go back to swilling
that shit.
Man, this shit is good.
Why don't you
buy your own food?
This is all you getting.
Don't ask for
no more of that.
That shit
tastes good as hell.
Yo, y'all heard about
what happened to Little Kevin?
What?
He be dead.
- He up in them vacants.
- Why?
Fucked up somewhere,
I suppose.
Uh-oh.
What the fuck you little
hoppers doing on my avenue?
- Eating.
- Shit you are.
You're probably setting up
to snatch a purse.
Get the fuck back
on the reservation
where your
black asses belong.
How you feeling,
little man?
Need a hand with that food:
I said get.
Yo, y'all hear that shit?
"My avenue."
It's just as much
ours as it is his.
Walker be evil, yo.
He be thieving and
smackin' folk down.
Yo, we should
get him back
on the payback tip
for all the dirt he do.
You want to throw
down with police?
I don't mean
go at him direct,
but, you know, hurt him.
Like, slash his tires
or some shit.
We could stick
condoms on his car.
That'd send a message.
Yeah, but what kind?
We should slap bumper stickers
on his windshield.
I mean, they
is hard to get off.
Hold on,
wait wait wait.
Do Officer Walker
go to that club on Stockton,
the one where
the Western police party?
I seen his car there.
I got this one.
And as much as I empathize,
I can only tell you
that there is a process
for complaints
like this one.
Don't sell us on process,
Mr. Mayor.
We've had years of this kind
of treatment from city police.
You need to understand
we view this as an affront
to the cloth.
We've asked for
a civilian review board
for decades now.
Absent that, how can we trust
any investigation
of any complaint?
Forgive me, gentlemen,
but last I checked,
the department had
a black commissioner
and a black
l.I.D. director.
The problem is systemic.
And as to
Commissioner Burrell--
we understand that
his authority is now limited.
Mr. Mayor, when it comes
to matters like this one,
do you expect us to have
faith in Deputy Rawls?
I expect you'll
be good enough
not to prejudge
the department's response
before the investigation
even begins,
as I won't prejudge it.
I can only tell you that l
take this incident very seriously,
and that I will pursue
all of the facts.
Well, Mr. Mayor,
you said you would
have an open door,
and so far I credit you
for keeping that promise.
And my door will always
be open to you.
Thank you.
If they couldn't get civilian review
out of a Royce administration,
how can they think
they're gonna get it from me?
They're just
testing you here,
trying to see how vulnerable
you feel on the racial stuff.
On Burrell, too,
for what it's worth.
Well, civilian review
is a nonstarter.
You go now there now,
you'll be bending over
for four years for the ministers.
So what?
I throw them a bone
and fire some idiot cop?
By pressing that,
the average beat cop's
gonna hate my guts,
and I ain't gonna change
anything around without
rank-and-file support.
You don't fire him,
you're going to piss off
most of the black
political infrastructure.
Mm, yummy.
My first bowl of shit.
Circle that
right there.
And you press
that right there.
It's work time.
You guys got work to do?
You write down that data?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Charlene, what don't
you understand?
None of it.
Okay, let's see if we can find a way
you can get it, okay?
What's the diameter?
- Huh:
- It's seven.
Good. Okay,
what's half of that?
You can't take half of it.
Okay, let's say
you have $10
and you gave
half of it to Jasmine.
Why I do that?
Well, just pretend, okay?
You give her half,
how much does she have?
- Duh, $5.
- Good.
Now let's say this
time you have $7
and you give her half,
how much does she have?
$3.50.
Good, so...
Yo, Mr. Prez,
check this out.
Oh!
Why we no pick him up at his casa,
follow him from there?
Why, so we can
lose him here again?
Papa, nothin' say he got to come back
through this way, you know?
What if he take
another road...?
All right.
We pick him up
from his casa tomorrow.
Poutin'.
Don't pout.
Omar, I'm tired
of this, bro.
Lo siento, baby.
Lo siento.
Hey, now...
there she blow.
All right, then.
So we agree staring down
a stick-up boy on a corner
takes courage,
and we agree it takes
courage to go overnight
to Cheltenham or Hickey.
This is a good list,
but are there any
examples we can make
outside of being
on a corner?
I need a volunteer.
Not me.
What about you, Albert?
No.
You volunteer
and you don't know what for,
you ain't got brains.
All right, then,
I need a volunteer
to stand on this box
blindfolded, fall off,
and let us catch him
before he hits the ground.
Albert?
That's fucking stupid.
What about you, Namond?
Wait wait wait,
let me get this right.
So you want me to stand up
on that box,
put a blindfold on, fall,
and expect these
weak-ass clowns to catch me?
Hell, no.
Hey, yo, y'all drop me,
and we gonna have
more than words.
A'ight.
All right, everybody
gather around.
Oh, shit.
You ready? On three.
One, two, three.
Let him drop.
Whoa! Shit!
Oh, that shit was right.
All right,
who wants to go next?
Albert?
I ain't doing no
stupid shit like that!
Fuck you, and fuck all
y'all bitches.
We don't like
your ass anyway.
Settle down,
settle down.
Yo, today's specials
are those little Hershey bars,
three for a dime.
And I got all your
other favorites, too.
Yo, Deante,
I got your licorice--
red and black both.
Snitchin' Randy.
Well, I'll be blessed, yo.
Lookit.
This is good?
We put him here?
That tall man with Prop Joe:
Yo, for real,
on this caper
the more we learn,
the less we know.
- We can go?
- No, we stay.
Papa, I need to go.
I say we stay, Renaldo.
What's wrong, yo?
No no, I mean "go."
We been in the car
too many hours.
Whether you squat in an alley
or sittin' on
a porcelain throne,
don't really change
the moment, now do it?
Rough day?
Doesn't help to hold it in.
What the fuck you know?
If you tell me,
maybe we can help.
Ain't nothing.
Look, come on, Albert, you been
doing real good in this class.
Real good till today.
Just give it a try.
I went home yesterday.
My mom's on the couch.
She dead.
Me-maw said best l
come to school, but...
Oh.
Yeah, you wanted
to be with your mom.
Of course you did.
Some of you know me
from narcotics work,
some from earlier if you
worked the Western district,
and some of you I'm meeting
for the first time.
But the only point l'd
really like to make here today
is that this is
a transitional time
for this department
and for the city as a whole.
We have a new mayor
and a new state's attorney,
and they both feel like
they have a mandate for change.
The point is that given
the mayor's position on crime
and given the outcome of the election,
we can expect certain enhancements.
Oh, really?
Certain improvements may be
forthcoming in the near future.
So we're looking
for feedback here,
some input
as to what we need
more of or less of
to better work murders.
- Better witness protection.
- More proactive investigation.
Pay raise.
Yeah!
Better lab work. More techs
on duty. More overtime.
More Scotch!
More time for case prep.
Seriously.
More women.
Loose women.
Pay hike, double-digits.
Mo' better,
mo' better, mo' better.
That's what we want.
Sounds like a new day,
don't it?
Department's finally gonna
get what it needs.
State's attorney's
office, too.
A new day.
They make a nice
couple, anyway.
Looking forward to working
with you, Colonel.
That's signed by
a now-inaugurated mayor
ordering his police commanders
to avoid mass arrests.
Community-based policing
and high-end enforcements
are to be emphasized.
I take it Burrell
got a copy.
In person.
I don't see it.
Why not just fire
the fucking asshole?
The mayor is weighing
his options.
What the fuck
does that mean?
To fire Burrell,
we're going to need more
political capital
than we have right now.
Speaking of which,
it brings us to another
Iittle piece of business.
- The thing with the minister.
- It's a delicate situation.
The ministers are pressing
for a civilian review,
which I know the rank and file
don't want to hear,
but it speaks directly to
the situation with Burrell.
If we expend capital
defending this incident--
I get it.
You want the cop fired.
No, we're not saying
that at all.
The mayor doesn't
want to interfere with
the everyday workings
of the department.
But it's a balancing act.
Our response has to be
smart and evenhanded,
in a racial sense, especially.
If I'm hearing you,
it's about perception.
Exactly.
I.I.D. has
a black commander,
but he's beholden to Burrell.
He'll stir shit
with this if he can.
The sergeant in question
is assigned to C.I.D.
His new commander
is Daniels.
He's smart, he's black,
and politically neutral.
- That work for you?
- Works for us.
Who that?
I said, who's that?
You home or you
just visiting?
Home if I can.
All right. Get by the fire
if you want.
I got a couple of dogs left.
You hungry?
Shit weren't working
out with Jo-Jo and them.
Said I owed him some cheddar
on some shit some other boy did.
I don't want to make
no noise on that, though.
They pressin' you.
You know...
get with me, and we pay
'em right back, okay?
No, all that shit
you been sayin' to me
goin' through my head.
Forget about that.
Forget about all that.
If I wouldn't have
pushed you off,
you would have never
been up on that corner.
But everything I do
I be fucking up.
Whole time it feel like it
wasn't me on that corner.
I just wanted to get away.
Well, you're here now,
ain't you? Right?
This is you, right here,
right now, okay?
You're burning a hole
in that shirt, man.
Fuck-- you fucked me
all up when
I saw you walking through
the door, Sherrod.
Oh, shit.
What you think, huh?
You know, I get
half price for this.
All right,
take your hat off, man.
Don't burn them
pimp steaks, huh:
Took long enough.
Yo, Dukie,
you sure about this?
I mean,
I'm with y'all.
Y'all my boys like that.
Y'all there for me,
I'm there for y'all.
I'm really starting to think
this is some fucked-up shit.
I mean, Officer Walker's
a shady motherfucker,
but he's police.
We do it Michael's way,
we send a message.
You ain't got to do
what I got to do.
We drew straws, Na'.
Let's go.
This is everything?
Sergeant Hauk's statement,
the ministers',
statements of the other
officers-- it's all there.
No independent witnesses, huh:
It's a lot of smoke,
but I'm not feeling much
in the way of fire.
It was a strong case
for discourtesy.
True, but no indication of
racial or religious overtones.
And the brutality
allegation is a stretch.
I've gone over G.O.C.-7.
I'm up to speed
with the matrix,
but since the buck stops
with me on this one,
walk me through my options.
Minor offenses, you can
issue a summary judgment--
a period of extra
duty without pay,
guidance and counseling,
the like.
Or if Sergeant Hauk
fights your decision
or if there's a more
substantive charge,
it goes downstairs
to a trial board.
And possible termination?
Let me ask you--
if the minister's connected,
and if all eyes
are on this one,
what does command
want to see happen?
What does City Hall
want to see happen?
City Hall just wants
someone to do the right thing,
whatever that is.
You're sitting here, Deputy,
telling me to just
do the right thing?
Doesn't happen often,
I know.
Hey! What are you doing?
Come here!
You motherfucker,
I'll get your little ass!
Hey hey hey!
Come on,
show me hands, bitch.
Back the fuck up,
little hopper, I'm police.
Yeah, I know,
you the police who like
to fuck with a nigger.
Turn around.
Hey hey, yo!
You ain't gonna
hear the next one.
Get on your knees,
cross them legs,
knit them hands, come on.
Ooh, hold on.
Yo, what the
fuck you doing?
What the fuck
is wrong with you, man?
Hey, give up that ring, man.
Come on.
Yeah.
Aah!
Ha ha ha!
Payback.
That's right.
Run, motherfuckers!
Shit!
I'm telling you,
right there,
this horse is a winner.
Look at it, okay?
How you doing?
- Hey.
- Excuse me.
Mr. Mayor.
On my way downtown today
I saw an abandoned car.
Tow it right away.
Where is-- Mr. Mayor,
the location?
Oh, fucking Christ.
Call Transpo!
Get the fucking
trucks moving!
Uh-- Mr. Mayor.
I got a constituent call.
She said the playground
near her house was a hazard.
- Rusted metal.
- We'll get right on it.
The location:
Sir, I need a location.
Mr. Mayor, I understand your concern,
but you've got to understand,
we have more
than 9,100 hydrants.
And one of them's leaking.
Sensitivity counseling,
two week's extra duty,
no punishment past that.
They sliced it
into the rough.
Does Daniels know the bind
this puts his boy Carcetti in?
Well, Wilson briefed Rawls,
Rawls briefed Daniels.
It's Carcetti
doing Pontius Pilate,
putting it on Daniels,
who was a safe choice
as far as
the rank and file goes.
But that won't be enough
for the ministers,
not by a long shot.
Am I the only one that knows
how to play this game?
Let's go,
get that hydrant sealed.
Three of them with shotguns
got me coming
outside the club.
I made 'em for bloods.
The paint's supposed to be some
kind of declaration of war.
Sounds like we get
to stomp some ass.
The Western District way.
Yellow paint
a declaration of war?
That's a new one.
So what I heard was
that these wild-ass boys--
I ain't saying no names--
but they past crazy.
They robbed him.
They threw paint on his ass--
yellow paint.
Shit, I ain't lying.
Well, I don't know
about that,
but you showed me something
getting on that box like that.
That wasn't nothing.
No, don't sell yourself short.
Ms. Duquette,
Mr. Parenti,
we all thought
it took courage,
especially considering
how y'all do each other.
You think?
Yeah.
No, look, you're showing
a lot of progress in class.
I mean, you know that,
don't you?
You know, you're doing
the work. You're not acting out.
It's getting
to the point where
You can go back to regular
class, no problem.
- Back to genpop?
- Mm-hmm.
You want me to go?
Well,
if you're ready.
I ain't going back there.
Why not?
Shit they teach
there be deadly.
But I know
you know that, Bunny.
All right, all right!
All right, all right!
We can squeeze a little
money from here and there
but nothing on the scale
for what you're asking.
Maybe free up
some operating money
by shifting some of these
PAYGO projects
into the capital program.
I can steal a little from
the budget stabilization fund,
but we still got to absorb
1 20 grant positions
in the police department,
mostly officers.
Christ, don't let
those go unfunded.
A lot of balls in the air, and I still
haven't seen the schools' budget.
What about
the revenue surplus?
As I said,
that's one-time money.
If I'm going to give
the police a 5% raise, that's forever.
If I'm going to ask the police
department to get up
on its hind legs and fight
I got to throw some money.
You're telling me how I can't
do it, not how I can.
There's the rainy day fund,
but you really shouldn't
draw that down.
The bond rating houses want
at least 5% of the budget in reserve.
Feels like a rainy day to me.
Cloudy like a motherfucker.
Yo, yo, wait up, yo.
- Fuck is up with y'all?
- Ain't you, Mike?
We wanna have a word
with your boy here.
- Ain't nothing stopping you. Talk.
- You know what we mean.
Yo, the little bitch
was talking to the police.
That's a lie.
I ain't been doin' no snitching.
The fuck you ain't.
He look like he about to pee
on hisself right now, man.
You ain't gonna stand by
no rat motherfucker, is you?
Naw, I ain't standing
with no rat.
These here be them
18-hour junks.
Go to bed, wake up,
still be hot.
Man, feel this one
from three hours ago.
See what I'm saying?
Two for one.
Each pack come with two pads.
Buy five, I give you six.
Gimmie six then.
Five.
Keep toasty.
Obliged, sir, obliged.
Take this side,
I'll take this side.
Bubbles Depot.
Bubbles Depot
got what you need.
Back on the scene.
Come see me.
Oh, looky,
looky-- hey, Sherrod!
Whoo-ooh. What up?
Car must've hit it
or some shit.
- How much you think?
- Aluminum?
Aluminum about
30-40c a pound.
We've got a Benjamin
here easy, baby.
Teamwork payin' off today,
ain't it, baby?
Yeah.
Go get the heavy side.
Let me try it.
Get out of the way!
That's enough!
Get out of here!
That's enough!
Break it up!
Hey, Randy, you bitch.
We ain't even done
with your snitchin' ass.
Come on, man.
Guess them books
are good for something.
Somebody call the nurse.
Yo, why they bank me?
- I ain't no snitch.
- Randy, Randy, it's okay.
Thanks a lot.
Health Department shut
Chicken George again?
No, I had to duck
in here for cover.
Your boys are
off the hook today.
Not a good day to be
cross-eyed in West Baltimore.
What, y'all behind on your
quotas or some shit?
What the fuck?
Seems one of my side
got jumped last night.
Yeah, Walker.
I heard about that shit.
Threw paint on him.
Walker's an asshole.
Hey, you play in dirt,
you get dirty.
7-Adam-14, do you copy?
Go ahead, KGA.
Report of a burglary
19 North Monroe.
Copy.
We should do this again.
Don't go making
any furtive moves.
No doubt.
Don't break a pencil point.
Mr. P, I swear I only told
the police what everybody knows.
Does that make me
a snitch, Michael?
Shouldn't oughta
told nobody nothing.
But that don't make you a snitch,
not if you ain't put nobody in.
Jesus. I should have
stopped this.
It ain't your fault, Mr. P.
All this come up because
of what Tiffany said
happened in the bathroom.
What did you tell them, Randy?
What do they know?
I just told them about Lex going up
to the playground behind Fulton,
and how everybody
said he got killed
and put in one of them
boarded-up houses.
That's all you told them?
I mean, they wanted me
to say that I was there, but...
I just told them
that Little Kevin told me.
- Little Kevin?
- He killed, too.
I mean, Marlo got him, too. That's
what everybody saying, anyway.
Marlo Stanfield:
I heard Kevin got
locked up just last week,
now he's supposed to be up
in a house somewhere.
They put him in
a vacant, too, huh?
Okay, Randy, for now
I want to say Michael's right.
If anyone tries
to talk to you again,
say nothing to anyone,
understand?
Will that make it better?
So in sum, gentlemen,
the gods have spoken.
No longer do we live
and die by stats.
From this day forward
we are about quality arrests--
felonies, serious misdemeanors,
the back-to-basics police work
of our sainted fathers.
Still, the truth is
it would be easier
to turn an oil tanker
around in a puddle.
Our people were
raised on stats.
If you can't bend patrol
to the mission, Eugene,
I'll damn sure find
someone who can.
Gentlemen.
Sir.
Along the line
of what you propose,
I'd like to reconstitute
the Major Crimes Unit,
bring it under the
umbrella of Homicide.
And let me guess, you'd like
to shake up the personnel.
Where appropriate.
Go for it, Colonel.
What?
Smart move,
accepting any ideas
whatsoever come from
the anointed fella.
Daniels.
The next commissioner.
Any cocksucker that
manages to go from
Iieutenant to full bird in
a little more than a year
is getting groomed.
Wait. You didn't for
a minute think that--
Jesus, Bill,
it's Baltimore.
You ain't one
of the natives, are ya?
You see where they went?
El gordo and tall man,
they go in a big room,
first floor.
Sign outside
say "New Day Coop."
Coop?
What's a coop?
"New Day Coop."
That's what it say.
Hey, yo, was there like a bar
between the two O's?
Si, exacto.
Yeah, that's co-op.
Prop Joe in a co-op:
Joe go in with
the man we robbed.
Remember, he fell
down on his knees,
wept like a little baby.
Yeah, Fat Face Ricky.
Anybody else?
Si, como eight or nine
others I never see before,
but all the same to me,
you know?
Narcotraficantes.
Prop Joe done
sat down to the table.
Oh, do tell.
The worm done
came full circle.
Marlo.
Que?
If that is what
I think it is,
our little clutch of
chickens might be putting
all their eggs
up in one basket.
Is good?
Muy bueno, baby.
I know one thing--
I wouldn't walk around
with it on my neck
for Walker to find.
He ain't gonna find it.
You crazy even
taking a chance.
If he catch you with it,
he gonna break more
than them fingers.
Man, what up with you?
It's like lately
you gone all...
Iike taking off
the mask, yo.
What up with that?
If Walker got a look--
He didn't.
Well, what about the thing
with you and Randy?
Everybody now is sayin'
you threw down with him.
Busted up the boy
Dimples, and them.
Yo, you wouldn't
have stood tall?
That's not what I'm saying.
It's not that you do shit,
It's how you do it.
Yo, look, I'm not
trying to stand around
and let no chump-ass
niggers think I'm shook.
I ain't.
And?
And I want you to sign up.
Colonel,
there's the matter of--
You find
yourself incompatible
with a certain lieutenant?
Detective Freamon,
you have carte blanche
in picking your squad.
In fact, you can pick your
supervisor for all I care.
Motherfucker,
as far as I'm concerned,
you are the Major
Crimes Unit.
It's morning
in Baltimore, Lester.
Wake up and smell the coffee.
Reinforcements:
Carver.
Damn, boy, what brings you
back to the plantation?
I trusted you. Trusted Daniels.
My fucking mistake, huh?
Whoa, hold up.
What's wrong?
The kid you were
supposed to protect,
you put his
name on the street.
They were beating him in
front of the school today,
stomping on him
for snitching.
- Jesus. He all right?
- It's always the same.
I should have fucking
seen this coming.
I swear to you,
I don't know what happened.
I hooked the kid into
Bunk Moreland and Herc.
I can't believe--
where's the kid now?
Home.
Let me go give this
to the night commander.
We'll park a plainclothes
unit on the house.
You think that
makes it better?
We'll be discreet, set up down
the block or some shit.
Come on inside.
I swear to you--
I'm gonna find out
what happened.
- Ed Bowers.
- Pleasure to meet you.
You surprised us all.
- Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.
- Thanks.
I'd like to introduce
you to Dorothy.
You heard about Ed Nully?
I've heard great things about what
you've been doing, so keep it up.
I'm delighted you made it,
Mr. Mayor.
Well, it's for
a good cause, right?
I am getting
the evil eye, however.
I gotta keep him circulating.
Okay.
This way.
- See you later.
- Take care.
The Washington crowd is driving
the local real estate market now,
and if the harbor promenade
could extend
to the south branch--
- We're looking at that.
- Should be.
Everything from here
to Hanover Street is money.
Mr. Mayor,
play a little poker?
I'm not very lucky.
Luck can change.
Mr. Mayor, I'd like you
to meet Ray Chandler.
Pleasure to meet you.
Boy, either you gonna do it,
or I'm gonna.
There's a reason the police
keep jumping out on you, Na'.
So, was it the Bunk's
cologne, huh?
Oh...
pussy.
I'm gonna miss you,
too, bitch.
Lester do love listening
to other people's
phone calls, don't you?
A bit of a pervert that way.
You could use
a wiretap case or two--
broaden your horizons.
Oh, no no.
The Bunk is strictly
a suit-and-tie motherfucker.
At all hazards, a man
must keep up appearances.
Dignity, I say.
Dignity above all,
Governor. Hear, hear!
Bunk,
you got a minute?
What's up?
The Wagstaff kid
I sent your way.
Wagstaff?
He one of mine?
Yeah, you were looking
for the boy Lex,
shot someone outside a nightclub
a couple of three months back.
This kid knew about
Lex getting killed.
Herc brought him to you.
Herc:
This kid is a witness,
and Herc was supposed
- to bring him to me?
- That was the plan.
I'm gonna skin
that motherfucker.
Jesus, Herc.
The fuck did you do?
Something happen to that boy?
Well, young man,
your wish has come true.
So this mean I can
finally get out of here?
Yes, Monnel, paperwork was slow
coming in from North Avenue,
but you five
are at the age
where we feel
it's to your advantage
to join your peers
in the ninth grade.
Yo, we in high school!
- When we bump?
- The end of this marking period.
Congratulations.
You're excused.
Mr. Johnson, you have a visitor
in the front office.
Mr. Johnson, please come
down to the front office.
Bad news:
Plenty more to go around.
They pulled the pin
on your program.
As I've been saying
this week at every roll call
in every damn district, if I could
scrape together any more, I would.
But for starters, it's a
5% salary year, and that's a given.
I know it's not half
what you deserve,
but if the revenue estimates stay good,
I promise you'll be seeing more.
Mr. Mayor,
my wife thanks you,
my children thank you,
my dog thanks you.
Hey, Santy, how you able to
tell your wife from your mutt?
His wife, she's the one
that's got the fleas.
Shit, Bobby,
with your old lady,
fleas would
be an improvement.
At ease. We got the mayor
here, gentlemen.
When they sit in one place
too long they get a little feisty.
I'm not going to stand here and
pretend I know how to do your job.
I don't. But what I can tell you
is that during the past few weeks
I have spoken with
many of your peers,
with your union reps, with
the representatives of the FOP,
and the biggest single
complaint I'm hearing
concerns the department's
obsession with stats.
The fucking numbers game.
Well, under my watch
the numbers game is over.
You will no longer be under
the gun to meet monthly quotas
of ineffective, meaningless
arrests and citations.
Thank you.
Excuse me, Your Worship.
You're not the first person
who stood at the podium
making promises.
Jimmy, I'm sure the mayor
has some pressing business.
No, I'm just saying,
the first community activist
who pitches a bitch about
the corner activity
in her neighborhood,
aren't we gonna go right back
to rounding up bodies?
Yeah, well, we need to educate
our citizens to the new approach.
Well, they're not the only
ones who need educating.
We got bosses that wouldn't know
police work if it bit 'em in the ass.
They been juking stats for years,
and they'll do it again
once the neighborhoods complain.
It's all they know.
Well, if the old dogs
can't get the job done,
I'll find new ones who can.
Look, for years I sat on
the back bench of the council
and watched our city
deteriorate.
It was business as usual
with the same old ideas
producing the same
old results.
Well, I'm here now, as you are,
and I'm asking you
to put aside your reservations
and give it a go.
All told.
You did good.
You got 'em pumped.
They love you.
Of course, the wrong
decision on Sergeant Hauk,
and who knows?
Carv said the kid had something
on it. I talked to him.
He had nothing,
just a bunch of hearsay
and some shit about zombies.
The boy was
to come to me.
You know the goddamn GO--
it's Homicide's call.
You don't go putting your paws
in my murder, you simple fuck.
Hey! You're talking
to a sergeant.
Oh, fuck your fucking stripes!
Whoa whoa,
take it easy, Bunk.
Now Herc is trying
to help us here.
Man, he messed
in my murder, he pays.
Give him a chance.
We can work something out.
That's easy for you to say.
You ain't the primary on this.
Motherfucker...
What got into him?
He's emotional.
He's been working this case
for a long time.
So the thing right now
is for you to remember
everything
you did on this case...
from the beginning.
He's out there,
hat in hand, literally.
Well, he can wait
till hell freezes over.
A wise man does not
burn his bridges
until he first knows
he can part the waters.
Old Ashanti saying.
Norman, you grew up
in Catonsville.
Show the motherfucker in.
Mr. Mayor,
I don't want to take time
out of your busy schedule.
Look, if this is about me countermanding
your orders for more arrests--
No, sir. You should proceed
as you feel the situation warrants.
Overall, policing strategies
may not be my strongest suit.
I'm here about
what I do know.
A recommendation from
Sergeant Hauk's commander
will cross your
desk tomorrow.
Colonel Daniels,
with Rawls concurring,
recommends sensitivity
training.
It may be
a fair decision,
it may even be
the right decision.
But we both know it won't
fly with the ministers,
not even with
Daniels behind it.
Hmm.
600 pages of rules,
regulations,
directives, orders.
You fire a white police
for a bad car stop
on a black minister, you'll
lose the rank and file.
It's not cause enough.
But if a commander can't find
grounds for firing
a saint in here...
The man has worked
Narcotics for six years,
and in Narcotics
there are no virgins.
And herein lies
your expertise?
Hmm.
I've always been comfortable
delegating strategic elements.
It's what
the Deputy Ops is for.
Me, I know what
a mayor needs.
- It was a Chevy Tahoe.
- Mm-hmm.
License Mike-460-654.
And I searched it good,
figuring I'd find some iron, but--
How'd they react?
Chris and Snoop?
They didn't do shit.
Was there anything
in the car?
Registration and crap
in the glove box,
empty chicken boxes, trash.
They had one of those
plastic milk crates--
Mm-hmm.
--in the back with
some tools in it.
What kind of tools?
I don't know,
carpenter tools.
Did you check the crate
for weapons?
Nail gun.
Nail gun?
Yeah, one of them bitches
that shoots nails.
They rig it to shoot
rounds maybe?
Naw, I shot it.
A nail came out.
Look, Lester, seriously,
is any of this helping?
Naw, you're doing good.
Tell me about jacking Marlo
at the train station.
I'm short four, right?
Yeah,
I remember your ass.
Here's my four.
You like that?
- Okay!
- I'm gonna beat your ass.
Okay, no more!
Stop stop stop stop.
Take the money,
take the money, all right?
Stop.
Make me work
this hard again,
I'm gonna
skin one of y'all!
Okay. Just go, man.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, man.
You know who got the fattest
asses and the best pussy?
- Who that?
- Midgets, nigger.
They're all that,
you know what I'm saying?
The fuck happened
to our boy on the door?
Siesta, Papa.
You fix this, Joe?
What's the problem?
Ran out of time.
Now, Joe, you've been
so busy being devious,
you done messed around and got
yourself caught up in a web.
Omar, I don't know what
you been hearing, now--
Joe, ain't no time
for no lies now.
Now see, I need you
to be straight,
just like you did on that
New Day Co-op sit down.
Oh, yeah,
I know about that.
I know you the one got Marlo
up in this mess too.
Hey, Omar,
take a deep breath.
A proposition might fall
kindly on your ear.
Well, tickle my fancy,
fat man.
Money, drugs-- your call.
Come on, now, Joe,
you can do better than that.
Hey, we-- we coming
at this all wrong.
See, you the one
with the high card.
You should speak your mind.
You going to serve up Marlo.
You gonna take out
Marlo Stanfield?
No no, but I got
a real powerful urge
to take everything he owns,
and I'm quite confident you
the man can make that happen.
That might take some doing.
Naw naw, see,
we got to have it simple.
See, Omar like it simple.
So how we gonna
do this, yo?
Huh:
My sister's boy.
He do the drop.
We call you
and give up the spot.
- That simple enough:
- That's what it is.
See now, Joe, I need you to
resist your natural inclination
to do anything twisted up
in this here play. You feel me?
I even catch a whiff of you
doing something foul, Joe,
I mean, I might got to go
tell Marlo you the one
put me up on that card game.
We understood?
Now go ahead and write
my ticket so I can tip on out.
Come on now.
Gentlemen.
I'll see to Tremaine.
- You can't be serious.
- Was you listening?
Omar to one side
holding a spade,
and maybe Marlo
to the other with a shovel.
And just at this moment,
I managed to crawl out
my own damn grave.
No way do I crawl back in.
What the fuck was
you doing out here, man?
You trust him?
- I trust his fear.
- Now we go, si?
Not till I teach Prop Joe
a thing or two about devious.
We on him now.
Sorry, guys, that's all
I got to say. Talk to the mom.
I hear you, but we just came
from his foster mother's house,
and she said it was you
that told him not to talk.
She said you told her
to get a lawyer.
That's right.
All right, look,
something got messed up.
We know that,
but whatever else happened,
we got a murder here.
Even if it's off the record,
it would help us
just to talk to the boy.
If you understand
what happened here,
you know I'm not
gonna do that.
If you go at it like that,
then you end up
siding with the motherfuckers
doing the dirt.
No, I'm siding
with my kids.
You're right.
You're right.
For you,
the kids come first.
We'll find another road.
Well, glad this
is working out for you.
Oh, man, you two...
makin' me all
weepy and shit.
Be safe, guys.
All right.
Hey, Roland, man,
you know, I hate
coming all this way
and not getting
a little something...
you know,
for old times' sake?
The playground behind
Fulton and Monroe,
unit block.
He told this fella Lex
to meet a girl there.
That's all he did.
What's up, Shorty?
Can you give me three?
Bitch, get the fuck
across the street
and plant your ass
on a stoop.
Kenard!
Yo, how do you think I look
with no tail on my head?
Do I look like a faggy?
Yo, Na'.
Yo, Mrs. Lee,
you looking for Michael?
Um, Namond, I don't want
to be no trouble to you,
but I got this friend
who been ailing,
you know,
and she gave me $6.
So I was hoping you
could, you know...
Yeah, we cover her.
Go see my man.
The fuck you do that for?
It's Michael's moms, yo.
Shit, she
a fucking dope fiend.
Namond said I could. Na':
Naw, it's cool.
Gimme Yellow Bird.
All right, but you ain't
got to be all up on me.
I know, I know!
I'm late, you know?
Sometimes it's just too much
damn fun being in charge.
Where you been, boss?
Announcing my presence
with authority.
Sorry I'm late.
Please sit down. Sit.
Sir, we scarfed up
52 vehicles.
Good.
But you missed my car.
We have new equipment
at school 45,
school 52, and school 58
installed.
Well, I got no calls on those, but keep
at it. You'll get there, I'm sure.
Mr. Mayor, all hydrants
are fully capped as of today,
and solid waste has
pulled 32 tons of trash
from the alleys, and, sir,
that's a single-day record.
That's what I want to hear.
Thank you, gentlemen,
and keep up the good work.
Finance, of course,
doesn't deal with
the dirt-under-
the-nails tangibles,
unless you consider the money
itself to be dirty.
- So what's in your agenda today?
- The school audit.
Well, how bad could that be?
The system is running
a $54 million deficit.
54 million?
Yes, Mr. Mayor.
Jesus Christ.
Did Royce know this?
How the fuck do we
deal with that?
Frankly, I'm not
sure just yet.
Our attendance is excellent,
and as to suspensions,
we don't have any.
We intervene immediately,
and we show success
in stabilizing behavior.
Not to mention the world of good
we're doing for the classes
these kids were wrecking
before the program.
In January we could
expand to four classes,
cover the whole eighth grade.
Any complaints about
the tracking,
- anything from the parents?
- Not a one.
This isn't a group where we see
a lot of parental intervention.
What about test scores?
I can't speak to
the program itself,
but it has to help
the rest of the eighth grade.
Next week will tell.
Right now the system
is under a lot of scrutiny.
We have certain fiscal issues
that are of great concern
to the new administration,
and what you're proposing here
is a radical shift
in curricula.
Meaning?
If City Hall were
to sign off on this,
we could go forward,
but now
is not the time
to rock any boats.
Hear that?
That's my joint right there.
So you all got your
work up to date, right?
Yeah
yeah yeah.
I heard you took care
of your puppy's problems.
Oh, he most definitely made
that go away, you hear me?
It's all good.
You know, some of
the young'uns been saying
your pup stood tall
with a snitchin' boy.
Michael:
Yeah, that's what
they saying.
- Huh.
- Yeah.
Lester, you really starting
to scare me, man.
- Need a crowbar.
- For what:
This is a tomb.
Lex is in there.
Oh...
fuck me.
Oh!
Oh, man!
Fuck.
Fuck.
- What's next?
- One to the head.
I keep it quick.
Not yet, motherfucker.
You shoot live rounds
like paint,
boy, you'll be the shit,
you hear?
Yo, but these really do
look like Glocks.
Yeah, they make them
look that way.
Yo, why you shoot low?
All right, if you're close,
aim for the head.
If not, think vest.
That's the way you said it.
A'ight.
Boy's learning.
- You going inside this one too?
- I'm gonna do the whole block.
It's bad enough
you popped the top
off one house
and give us a body.
What the fuck do you think
you're doing now?
- An experiment.
- An experiment?
Oh, fuck me.
I'm dealing with
Madam Curie here.
This nail here
comes from a nail gun,
and it comes from the house
with a dead man inside.
Every other house
has screws that H.C.D. uses.
We find these in the plywood
anywhere in this city,
and there's a body inside.
Gosh, that's good work.
No, I'm very impressed.
Do you see
a tool belt on me?
Do I look like one
of those fucking jerkoffs
in aisle five of
the Home fuckin' Depot?
There's three weeks left
in the year,
and our unit clearance
rate is under 50%.
We do not go
looking for bodies,
especially moldering
fucking John Does.
We do not put red up
on the board voluntarily.
Jay, the bodies
are in the houses,
Marlo Stanfield's bodies.
Then they belong to him.
Now I realize you're
no longer in my squad,
Mr. Major Crimes, but you're still
part of C.I.D., right?
And look,
I'm still a sergeant, right?
And I'm giving you
an order on this, Lester.
Until I feel chain-of-command
down on this
and until you hear otherwise,
you will not--
I repeat not--
pull down any more...
fucking wood!
Let's go, man.
I mean, you know,
I expect a shortfall
when I look at the school budget.
It's a natural.
But how in Christ's name
do you lose $54 million?
One million
at a time.
Exactly. It didn't
happen this morning.
This was
on Royce's watch.
You didn't get a whiff of this
during council review?
You can't blame the council or Royce
for the school budget.
The fiscal responsibility is
with the school board itself.
But the council
does have oversight.
Don't even pretend
to put this shit on me.
Only the city share shows up
on our budget review.
We never see
the state money.
You'd better tell your
pretty new chief of staff
that whatever happens
up on North Avenue
is on the school system.
That's a simplistic
view, I think.
How would you
complicate it?
As president of the school board,
I'll argue this is a bookkeeping issue.
We've simply been rolling the system's
debt over since '99.
You rolled it and rolled it
until it ran out of cash.
That's not bookkeeping,
that's stupidity.
So what are we talking
about here, waste?
Fraud: Embezzlement:
I would say that although the system
has some poor accounting practices,
in the end we're going to find
that most of the money
was properly spent
on programming.
Okay okay okay.
We get it.
No one's responsible,
not the school board,
not anybody on North Avenue,
not Clarence Royce,
not the city council,
no one at this table.
Fine.
So what's our next move?
Bump the property tax rate:
Scale back our budget.
No pay hikes, hiring freezes,
reduced services,
tell everyone-- schools,
police, fire, public works--
they have to hold the line
for a year or two.
How:
I just ran a clean-up-the-streets
campaign.
I just got done promising the world
to every cop in the city.
Annapolis.
You go beg
his Republican ass.
The Cheese stands alone.
This the drop:
I hope not, 'cause
they ain't called yet.
Make me feel bad
toward old Prop Joe.
Yeah, go around
where we can see y'all.
Vamonos, 'Naldo.
Nice hookup.
Private.
Damn, y'all some Semper Fi
motherfuckers, ain't ya?
Where Cheese go
to enlist?
That's 25 back to Joe
from what we was short before,
and another 1 50
to up our order to six.
Whoa, we had you down
for four.
I don't know if we got
extras coming off the boat.
Short someone else then.
I'll see what Joe says.
Yeah.
When we set with the re-up,
we'll hit you on that.
The shit will be where you told us
half hour later.
- Yo, we ain't using these no more.
- Us neither.
What we do is ring you
from a 958 exchange,
East Side,
don't need to answer.
Just toss it,
go to the meet.
See you when I see you.
Money on the table,
"hairon" to follow.
Stay here on Marlo?
Nah, we gonna stay
with Cheese.
Detective, would you
get the door for me?
Sometimes life just
gives you a moment, huh?
He was gonna do me,
and instead he gets done?
I'm dipped in shit here.
I'm the luckiest
motherfucker you know.
Gentlemen,
the target is still
Mr. Stanfield,
and from the look
of things,
we're no closer to him
than when I left here two months ago.
Now they might not
let me go after murders,
but they cannot stop me
from chasing the drugs.
Leander, I want you
surveilling his people.
See if they're still up
on cell phones.
How are you
with the paper trail?
- Okay.
- I want you down
at the city assessment office
pulling paper on all the purchases
on the West Side
over $100,000.
Then get down
to M.V.A. and check
Iuxury cars in his name,
all right?
Now this boy has been
in the game for a while now.
He might try
to launder money.
Herc, I want you
on the paperwork,
re-requisitioning
the wiretap equipment
that Marimow shipped
on down to l.S.D.
We're gonna need all of that
to get backup, okay?
If anyone needs me,
I'm down at Missing Persons,
all right?
Let's go.
- Lester?
- Yes?
- All this is cool...
- Mm-hmm.
...but you think we can do it
so that the direction comes from me?
I mean,
I am the sergeant here.
Donut, you think
this look right?
Why you knock 'em down?
So the police
won't scope me so easy.
But now all they gotta do is be like,
"Yeah, go over there
and just grab that little nigger
with the braids."
Damn, boy, you later
than a motherfucker.
Been sitting out here
watching money walk away.
You about to have
the day off.
Package was stolen, Na'.
What? Out the back
of your basement?
They kicked my motherfucking door in.
That's how they do.
Well, look,
how the police know
where you even be keeping
your stash at?
Some snitch-ass bitch,
that's how they know.
I'ma find his ass too.
All right, man, I'm out.
I never did understand
why you stopped eating the pig.
I ain't been in a Polack Johnny's
since 1974,
and if you knew what
was good for you--
Look, I know what's good.
I remember when you did too.
I never saw you
going all Muslim on me.
Ain't that, but I do
believe that other faiths
have got the pig figured
better than us A.M.E.s.
See that?
If you checking out,
I might feel the need
to say a few words.
Nah, I ain't got nothing
to do with that.
I love my PJs,
but they do repeat on me.
As memory serves,
you got to go with the original sauce,
not the kraut and chili
like you do.
My pain ain't
about no sauerkraut.
"The Puzzle Palace"
is ready to clip any program
that ain't tied
to the statewide tests.
The thing is, we're just starting
to make a little headway
- in what we're doing.
- You take it upstairs?
Yeah, me and the professor
went all the way
- to go see the school superintendent.
- And?
You read the papers?
They're a little busy
ducking that budget mess.
$50 million in the hole,
and they're scared
to take any more problems
to the new mayor.
- Is your thing a problem?
- Depends on how you look at it.
A cover-your-ass
type of person might say
we're just tracking any students
that can't hack in the regular classes,
giving them work that don't show up
on no statewide tests.
City Hall says it's okay,
they keep our program.
If not, we on the street.
Odell Watkins.
I was hoping
you'd say that name.
Yeah, he got
Carcetti's ear.
If we sell him,
maybe we sell the Hall.
Stalk that nigger, man,
that stole your shit.
- Yeah.
- Soon as he nod out,
bust him in the head
with a brick or some shit.
Nah nah.
That ain't me.
You can always give him
a hotshot then.
Y'all recall Junior Bunk?
Cutting his shit with,
uh, what you call it?
Stole it from
the funeral home.
Oh, you thinking
formaldehyde.
That's the shit.
Nigger's got a taste
of that shit,
university started
a "Junior Bunk" ward.
My cousin laid his ignorant ass
up there two, three times.
Ain't no guarantee
in that, though.
Use some rat poison then.
No, man, that stuff
don't cook up right.
What you need to use
is that sodium cyanide.
That shit looks and cooks
- just like the real thing.
- Where I find that?
Try, uh, Minter's
over there by the tracks,
or one of those metal shops
where they do plating.
- How much I need?
- It ain't gonna take much.
A vial of that shit'd kill every horse
in this stable.
- That's all there is to it?
- It ain't no thing to kill a nigger
who's already about the business
of killing himself.
And the police, they ain't
gonna pay no never mind.
You the one's got
to live with it is all.
More young males
than I'd have thought.
I don't suppose they all went off
in search of adventure.
You get a chance to do any
street work on these files?
Shit, no, Lester.
They cut Missing Persons
to one detective five years ago.
I barely keep up
with the paperwork.
Feel free.
Just make copies and return
the originals for the files.
For the files... right.
Damn, son.
Kenard said
the police took it?
He said they
kicked his door in.
And they ain't
lock no one up?
Yo, you see
that door?
Were the hinges broke?
I mean, if he said
they put the boot to it...
them hinges
gotta be hanging free.
I sweated him, yo.
He wasn't
trying to scheme me.
That little motherfucker
took that shit for himself.
Bet it.
And now you gotta
step to him,
put something real
behind them words.
Where your
Spanish boy at?
He's down on point with Cheese
while I round up soldiers.
You got soldiers
right here.
Your 2255 must have
pleased some judge, huh?
Enough to get me home,
didn't it?
I'm just saying, Butch,
I know they soldiers,
but I'm thinking about
being a little more subtle on this one.
You feel me?
So they don't see me coming.
It ain't like you
to work with strangers.
I'm celebrating diversity.
I'm thinking now the time
to start doing that.
Oh-hoo! What up, shorty?
What's up, baby?
- Mm, mm.
- Mm.
- Damn, girl, you looking good.
- I'm maintaining.
- Shit, I know that's right.
- You doing all right?
Yeah.
Long time, long time.
I got your word. Some real money
to be made on this one, huh?
You remember
how to do this?
I reckon it'll
come back to me.
See that's what
I'm talking about, Butch--
- subtle.
- Hmm.
Glasses first,
so they don't spot.
Yes, ma'am.
- Hello.
- Ho, Mr. Prezbo.
- Come in, please.
- Oh, that's okay.
I just wanted to stop by
on my way home
and drop off Randy's
work for next week.
Hopefully this thing
will be over soon.
Maybe so, but we're looking
at the possibility
of moving him to Booker T. Washington
next semester.
I hope
that isn't necessary.
I hope so too. Anyway, thanks
for bringing this.
I'll try to keep him
up to speed.
- Hang in there, kiddo.
- Thanks.
Long conference call.
About an hour
so far by my watch.
Got me out here
riding the wood.
Unfortunately
the governor's phone call
has gone longer
than anticipated.
Can I get you anything?
Coffee?
Look, I have
other appointments.
It shouldn't be
much longer.
Check out Fisher's
column in Metro.
He says,
the governor thinks, quote,
"This latest fiscal emergency
calls into question
the Baltimore school system's
ability to manage itself
as well as the local
oversight of the system,"
unquote.
Motherfucker.
He's playing
to the D.C. suburbs.
He sees you coming for him
two years from now.
He ain't no fool.
There's all your electronic
requisitions right there.
Mm-hmm.
What one's that, a cop?
Nah, security guard.
I don't think he's
one of Marlo's, though.
Lieutenant.
Will someone explain to me
what the fuck the brass is doing?
First I get bounced
to telephone reporting,
then I get
a call this morning...
How's that beach house
coming, huh?
It's almost done.
I just need a load of lumber--
That's great,
just great.
Welcome.
Welcome back.
Who the fuck is that?
That, Sergeant Hauk...
is one of the most
effective supervisors
in our police department.
Sorry. It's just taking a little longer
than we expected.
It shouldn't be
much longer, though.
I understand
what you're saying.
Some of those kids
are ready for high school,
but not Duquan.
- I've...
-...adopted him?
I've noticed Duquan
this semester.
He's more nourished,
wears fresher clothes.
Sometimes he even
smells like soap.
You and your wife,
you don't have children,
do you?
- Not yet, no.
- Well, have some.
For better or for worse,
they're yours for life.
The kids in this school
aren't yours.
You do your piece with them,
and you let them go.
Because there'll be plenty more
coming up behind Duquan,
and they're gonna
need your help too.
You've got your third period
in five minutes, right?
Settle down.
Settle down.
We need to concentrate
on these tests.
- Aw, fuck this, man.
- Talking about, "lf Jane's father
gives Jane one week's
worth of allowance..."
Shit, I ain't got
no allowance where I stay at.
No father, neither.
How many sides a sexagon got?
Why I care about that?
You need to take the test
so you can move on to the next level.
I ain't moving nowhere
but out this motherfucker.
- Hell, yeah.
- All right. Let's settle down.
Let's start with
question number one.
Settle down!
All right.
All right, listen up.
Here's the problem:
Two couples go
into a restaurant.
- They get the check--
- Yo, when they say "couples,"
- do it mean they married?
- Why they got to be married?
Mr. Prezbo, why you
even get married?
Well, to build a life
together, for one--
you know, family.
- Also to have intimacy.
- What do that mean?
- Mean, like, getting some.
- No no. It's not just that.
Intimacy can be, um,
a quiet conversation.
Or it can be fun,
you know?
Like when you tickle
your partner.
Yo, tickle my nuts.
All right, all right,
no more of that.
Come on, let's get
to the test material.
The statewide exam
is next week.
And then we'll get back
to the regular lessons.
Can we talk
about intimacy?
If you like, and if I don't
get too embarrassed.
All right, uh... so,
the grand total on the check
is $67.40, but if they
want to leave a tip--
Look at your
sample test, please.
I got to say, Ms. Duquette,
I feel like y'all schemed us.
This class is the same
as the ones down the hall.
Yeah, it's 'cause
the test's coming up.
Okay, class, let's take a look
at the sample math test.
In sample "A",
we start with...
Kid's right.
This is bullshit.
The test material doesn't
exactly speak to their world.
Yeah, don't speak
too loud to mine, either.
An estimate,
Detective.
We start opening
those houses,
we might turn over
a couple of dozen bodies,
but that's
just me guessing.
All of them homicides?
The boy took over
half the West Side.
We never saw the violence.
This right here
is the reason why.
You're asking us to call out
half of public works
and pull the plywood off
thousands of vacant houses
all so we can raise
the city's murder rate by 10%?
What else are we doing
on Stanfield?
I'm trying to get backup
on his people's cell phones
as fast as I can.
And I started to look
for his money.
But if I'm right about this,
they have to be worked.
Is there any evidence at all that
links all these missing-persons reports
to the Stanfield
organization?
I'm just starting at that.
The one body
that we pulled out of the Fulton
Avenue house is Lex.
His case is a direct tie.
And there are two other names
on those missing persons reports
that show up in our wiretaps
from earlier this year.
So, yes, there are links,
Counselor.
By any chance did Landsman
run this up the chain
to you guys?
No.
Your call.
My office won't care
until they see case files.
I'll run it upstairs
and we'll see what comes.
- Okay, I get it.
- He's still tied up,
but it really should only be
a little while longer.
Can you tell the governor
I have to go back to Baltimore?
I have a little bit
of business today.
I'm the mayor of a major American city,
for chrissakes.
How much shit do l
have to eat from this guy?
Wouldn't you play the politics
if you were him?
It's not like the state
had no role in this thing.
You know, the state money for those
schools had no oversight either.
But I'm not telling
"The Washington" fucking "Post,"
talking about how he might be forced
to bail me out because--
what was the quote again?
Because "Those are my children
in Baltimore too."
He's gonna bleed me
for that money.
Mayor Carcetti?
The governor's office says he's
ready to see you now.
$54 million's a big number.
We won't go until we get some,
we won't go until we get some--
Did I do
something wrong?
I ain't acted up or nothing.
You're ready for this.
You can do the work.
I know you can.
And if you need
to come back here
and use the showers
or give me laundry,
use the computer,
you can do that any time.
Anyway,
let me show you.
This here's the way
to the hard drive.
This isn't
necessary, Duquan.
Just in case
I'm busy, Mr. P.
So you know
how to work it.
Hey, boy.
What's up?
Big day for you.
See here?
I got the inventory
divided between us.
You gonna go up one way
towards North Avenue...
and I'm gonna stay down
by the highway.
You gonna let me handle
the money alone?
- You ready, ain't you?
- Yeah, I'm good.
All right.
Let's get on it.
I see you
back here tonight.
All right.
Hey hey, you see that foul motherfucker,
you let him have his money, okay?
I don't need you
messing with him.
- All right.
- All right.
Make sure
that count's right!
Yo, I need to talk to
the little motherfucker.
Maybe you can
do that with me,
see it don't
get out of hand.
Hey! Yo, Mike!
Yo, what up, Duke?
Yeah, I heard Randy's foster ma
gonna take him out of Tilghman too,
send him somewhere else.
That's messed up, man.
All right,
holla, man.
How many?
As a theory,
Detective Freamon
believes there could be
additional bodies in those vacants,
maybe a dozen or more.
- He believes:
- Lester Freamon is not in the habit
of selling woof tickets.
I, for one,
would not bet against him.
And what do you suggest
I do with this information?
My feeling is
that City Hall should be
brought into the loop.
We pull the bodies now
before New Year's,
and the stats go to Royce's
last year in office.
Matter of fact,
it gives Carcetti an advantage
with regards to
next year's crime rate.
- You mean--
- Tell the mayor that now is the time
to empty those houses,
not next year, when it's on his watch
and he has to eat the stats.
Colonel, I see you've
thought this through,
politically, I mean.
- I'm learning as I go.
- I bet you fuckin' are.
Colonel, keep this
conversation close.
That's a direct order.
You seen them girls
at Douglass, man?
Yo, you right, Duke.
Ain't gonna be like
middle school no more.
You know,
I'm just thinking, yo.
Dag, man, not again.
Where your
people at now?
Need any of your
stuff from the pile?
It ain't no thing.
Yo, man, listen.
Me and Bug got
our own spot now,
so you could come
crib with us if you want.
What you mean
Kenard took the stash?
And he's still
walking around?
I'm gonna talk to him, Ma,
make sure this never happen again.
Look at me, boy.
Kenard got to feel
some pain for what he did.
- He got to.
- I don't--
You don't what,
motherfucker?!
This how you pay me back
for all the love I showed?
Shit, I been kept you in Nikes
since you were in diapers.
- I'm trying.
- You trying, huh?
That's what you
gonna tell your father
the next time you see him,
that you trying?
Or you gonna tell him
what you've done?
What he done
got him locked up--
That's right. Wee-Bey walked
in Jessup a man,
and he gonna walk out one.
But you out here,
wearing his name,
acting a bitch!
Aw, look at you,
crying now.
Fuck you think you going?
Get your ass back here.
I ain't done talking to you.
I mean, I'm police, right?
Murder police,
and I got bodies.
I'm just supposed
to let them laying lie?
"We don't throw red up
on that board voluntarily."
That John-Goodman-
off-his-diet-looking
motherfucker
was clear on that.
- So go over Landsman's head.
- Mm, Jimmy, that's you--
send an anonymous fax. But you see,
Lester here don't fancy boats.
And me, I get sick
just filling the bathtub.
It's just wrong.
Yeah, just like when I seen J-Lo with
that little itty-bitty Spanish dude.
Genius. He hid his mausoleum
right in the neighborhood.
How little Pedro gonna
fill that big thing up?
Oh, man, that girl got
a prime cut of ass, boy.
- And a good heart.
- A good inverted heart.
This nail's
like their signature.
Find it in any door
in the West Side,
and right as rain
you're gonna find a body.
Yes, sir. I'm proud to be
chasing Mr. Marlo Stanfield.
Man, you act like you on the trail
of Pol Pot or some shit.
- Who?
- Motherfucker, I got $10 says
we can leave here
right now,
go to any boarded-up
rowhouse
with a nail like that
in the door,
and we will find a body.
- Make it $20.
- There you go.
Well, but first let's have another
little taste. Jimmy, you in?
- No, I'm good.
- Oh, come on, man.
Take that skirt off and have a drink,
for chrissakes.
- Drink that.
- Agh!
Man, don't play
like that. Aww.
Icicles, get 'em
before they melt!
Icicles!
Icicles, come get 'em!
Icicles!
Hey, yo, Kenard.
Why you lie to me?
Fuck you talkin' about?
You said the police
kicked your door in.
I seen the door.
They ain't kicked shit in.
- How you gonna lie?
- Go on, man.
- Yo, where the package at, man?
- Package up my ass, gump.
- I'm about to--
- You about to?
Go on, walk,
gump-ass motherfucker.
Hey, yo,
Iook at that little dude
getting his ass beat!
Y'all was talking too goddamn much.
Go ahead, Na'.
Get your pack off
this bitch so we can go.
I don't want it.
I don't want it.
I'll take that
20 now, Bunk.
I can't see shit in here.
Aw, man. I might pull out
my wallet, reach in,
and pull out
a $25 by mistake.
I need me some
Braille bills, something.
Hmm.
You ladies want
to call the Crime Lab?
Nah, man.
I'm like Stevie: too high.
You know I can't do no scene.
Well, there's not gonna be one,
on account of there is no body,
not until the bosses say there is.
And when that happens,
you gonna miss
all the fun, junior.
You know Daniels is gonna
keep this alive.
The white shirts will fuck it up
somehow. You know it, Lester.
Maybe not, this time.
Daniels is C.I.D.
It's a new day downtown.
I got it.
Whew,
world is on its hole
when Jimmy McNulty is
the most qualified to drive.
Yeah, up is down,
black is white... Ieft is right.
What we got here, huh?
- Quiet overnight.
- Cool.
Relief will be here
for you after roll call.
It's Sergeant Carver.
How you doing, dawg?
Quiet overnight.
You going to school
this morning?
We're gonna wait a little
longer on that to be sure,
but I can't say
I'm comfortable
going to work every day
and leaving him here.
Blow over in a week
or so, you'll see.
Till then we still have
a car on the house,
and you have my cell number
if anything comes up.
We're gonna look out
for you on this.
- Have you had breakfast, Sergeant?
- No, but I gotta--
You have time
for a plate, I'm sure.
Sure.
Yo,
I just dreamt something
gave me an idea today.
Hey, Sherrod.
You remember when
we turned that knocked down
Iight pole at the scales?
Pulled $80?
I been thinking
we can get to toppling
a couple of those
bad boys ourselves,
get all Paul Bunyan
and shit, you know?
I mean, we'll be all
discreet and all.
Not take the hacksaw
to no more than a couple
on some quiet streets,
leave more than enough
for some people
to have light and all.
Thing is,
I got this other thing
I still need to
take care of today.
Come on, Sherrod.
Wake up.
It's late.
No no no!
What you do? What you do?
What you do?
Aw, man, come on,
Sherrod.
Come on, man.
Come on. Come on.
You weren't supposed
to do this, man!
Oh, man!
- No phones:
- Not a one.
And the players that
were using them before--
Chris, Monk, Ray-Ray--
they were out there
on those corners.
Now I would have seen if
someone went to a burner.
God damn it!
If we just stayed up
on the wire two months ago,
we wouldn't be
going through this sh--
Can I help you?
Which one of you
is Sergeant Hauk?
I am.
I'm Shea.
This is Thomas. I.I.D.
Let me ask
if you remember
pulling a surveillance
camera from l.S.D.,
serial number AW466J9.
You remember that?
We also need to go over
your paperwork
on a couple of informants,
so if you don't mind
coming back downtown with us,
you and...
Detective Sydnor
and the third guy,
what's his name?
Dozerman.
You don't need
Sydnor or Doze, either.
Paperwork's all mine--
on the camera,
on the informants,
me alone.
Bodies?
How many?
Could be quite a few. We won't
know until we take down those doors.
And this is one drug organization
you think did this?
That's the theory, but nothing's
certain at this point.
What is certain is that
if we're going to do this,
you probably want us to do it now,
before the new year,
while the bump
in the murder rate
is still attributable
to Mayor Royce.
Thoughtful, Deputy,
very thoughtful.
I don't want any more stat games
from your department.
You need to get your people
into those houses because if there are
bodies in there,
they need to come out.
But do it now.
I don't want to be finding
any more bodies come January.
Yes, sir,
Mr. Mayor, sir.
Choice comes down to this:
We take the state money,
and instead of being
fucked up and broke,
our schools go back to being
merely fucked up.
No teacher layoffs, no program cuts,
no school closures.
But the price
the governor's asking is
more state control
over the school board
and changes in the teachers' union
contracts that would allow them
- to remove tenured faculty for cause.
- Ouch.
If we don't take the money,
it looks like we're shorting our kids.
We take the money-- we're giving up
local control of education,
which is gonna lose us
a lot of middleclass black folks.
Not to mention the problem
you might have two years from now
running in the D.C.
suburbs,
explaining how you
needed their money
to bail out
your schools.
He sees you coming, Tommy.
That's not
important right now.
Take the money.
We need it.
Don't look at me.
If you take it,
you're selling out the teachers,
and that's my base.
If you don't take it,
you're selling out the kids.
Either way, I'll probably rip you,
and half the council will too.
Just glad
I'm not the mayor.
- You called?
- Word down the chain: Open 'em up.
And it's my guess this case
is gonna need more manpower.
Yeah, no doubt.
In fact,
I might have lost Herc
to an l.I.D. file.
Really? I went light
on him for that car stop.
I didn't even think
it would get to a trial board.
This feels like
a bigger jacket.
Pick any two you want
from C.I.D. for now.
If you get back up on a wire,
we'll detail a few more.
Beautiful.
I don't know what
you're talking about,
but she was hot.
I'm going back on Friday
right after work.
Hold on.
What the fuck
are you staring at?
How are you
liking Homicide?
Loving it. Why?
Anyway.
It's on the way, boss.
It's Joe
and his message,
but we already know
what it is.
All right, girl.
Keep it close.
All right, 'Naldo, call your amigos
and tell them it's on.
That's right.
Yep. That's it.
One, come on.
Let me see
that footwork.
That's it.
One, one,
one, one.
That's right.
Yo, what's going on,
Mike?
Man, yo, I feel like
I could just pancake
a young'un right now,
you know what I mean?
What about you, Duke?
Want some go?
No, I'ma
work this rope.
Yeah, you working it.
Like a gump.
They pull around back,
we're gonna come at 'em
from both ways, feel me?
Ooh.
Hey, yo, call your friends,
tell 'em where we at.
Yo, let me get that rope.
I said I'm workin' it.
Man, I said you's a gump,
fucking dogshit
and smelling-ass nigger.
Hey. Hey! Hey!
Man, fuck this.
Yeah! Go along! Get!
Don't nobody want you
in here, no way!
You see what happened?
That be it.
Hey, Daddy.
Kiss the butt
of this lyricist.
Blow on my mike
and make a wish.
Get up! Everybody, get up.
Get up!
Let me get a $10, Daddy.
Let me get a $10. I need a $10.
Get the fuck
out of here, now.
- Come on, I'll suck your dick for $15.
- Trick-ass bitch, I said get.
Don't you want
to see my stuff?
Nah, ain't nobody
want to see that stink box.
- Get your ass gone.
- Come on, let me get a $10, player.
What the fuck is this,
the lnner Harbor?
Yo, what the fuck y'all
think you doing?
- We painters.
- Si, we paint.
Move the van out the way.
Oh, you gonna like
what I got, soldier.
See? We paint.
We paint.
Oh... okay.
Which one of y'all
gonna open the truck for me?
Fucking amateurs.
Drink it slow, son.
What am I gonna do?
I'll run you home.
I-- I can't go home.
She expect me
to be my father, but...
I ain't him.
I mean, the way
he is and shit...
it just ain't in me.
What's between
you and Michael?
Mike ain't Mike no more.
He went hard
on this boy last night,
fucked his shit up.
I can't go home.
I can't.
Give us a minute.
Mad at myself, man.
I shouldn't have shut
Michael out like I did.
Namond did push it.
He ain't pushing
nothing now.
Reckon I'll go
mend the fence.
This ain't no motel.
Deacon, how'd you
get by my people?
You can't turn away church folk,
ain't done in these parts.
You only come by
for a favor, so what is it?
You know a fella
named Bunny Colvin?
Yeah, that rogue
police commander,
tried to legalize drugs.
- What's he done now?
- He can tell you best.
You did not bring--
It's something
positive, Odell.
- Has to do with kids.
- Positive, huh?
Bunny.
Delegate Watkins.
What's this all about?
It's another bright idea.
- You Michael Lee's mother?
- He got papers on him or something?
I ain't no kind of police.
- I'm just looking to get up with him.
- You ain't alone.
He booked on out of here,
got his own spot,
took his little
brother with him.
- You know where he stay at?
- He ain't tell me nothing.
You find the boy, you let him know
I need some help around here.
I popped him
and Bug out my ass,
and now they forgot
where they came from.
What my ma say
when you called?
She was mad, right?
Not really.
His mother...
Lovely lady.
What she say?
"Put that bitch in baby booking
where he belongs,
Iet him learn
something."
She hung up
before I could
tell her we didn't
have a charge.
Baltimore City 911.
Yeah, they beating a cop
over here on Pennsie and Gold.
- Police officer?
- Yeah, they're beating on him bad.
- Pennsylvania and Gold?
- Yo, they firing shots now.
Signal 13, report of shots
fired, Pennsylvania and Gold.
Signal 13--
They cleaned
the motherfucker out, Joe,
put it in the van them Mexican
niggers rolled in.
I ain't hearing
about no resistance.
Man, wasn't
no time for that.
Omar had one of them
commando squads with him, man.
I mean,
he had this one ho
pulling guns
out her pussy, Unc.
The shit was unseemly, man.
I got to hand it
to Mr. Little,
- I ain't see this one coming.
- They took the shipment, Joe.
Not no package, man,
the motherfucking shipment.
Man, what we gonna
tell the co-op?
Hey, where you think
my mind at right now?
All I know, it's a lot of gangsters
out a lot of shit, man.
I say we mob up and go
find this faggot, see?
That's what's really 'hood right there.
That's how you deal with shit.
A lotta gangsters in that room need to
take us at our word first.
Yeah, first thing
they gonna wonder about...
is us.
You need to see my man.
I'll hook you up.
Who is this motherfucker?
Let me get
a word with you, Mike.
Listen, you got
to understand
I can't be having
no physical confrontation
Iike the one took
place back there.
That kind of thing
got to stay outside my gym.
Yeah. Go ahead, Montel.
I come to tell you
I was wrong,
the way I handled it.
Step off, nigger.
Mike...
Don't touch me, man.
Look, man,
this here ain't you.
Man don't want you
touching on him.
Mike.
I told you,
step the fuck off.
Young man, if I was talking
to you, you'd know I was.
Shit!
He'll listen next time.
Go ahead, man.
Do him.
Nah, man.
I'll hang here
for the ambo, all right?
Go with your people.
Go ahead, son.
Dr. Johnson, please call Neuro l.C.U.
Dr. Johnson, please call Neuro l.C.U.
I'm sorry, son.
I'm gonna talk
to Social Services.
We'll get you some help.
Randy...
Would the on-call please
return to Neuro l.C.U.?
On-call, please
return to Neuro l.C.U.
You gonna help, huh?
You gonna
look out for me?
You gonna look out for me,
Sergeant Carver?
Do you mean it?
You gonna
look out for me?
You promise?
You got my back, huh?!
All that from overnight?
All that from Freamon.
He's out early today
rooting through empties.
You know what he is?
He is a vandal.
He is vandalizing
the board.
He is vandalizing this unit.
He is a Hun,
a Visigoth,
a barbarian at the gate,
clamoring for noble
Roman blood
and what's left
of our clearance rate.
And you sit here
doing what exactly?
A hot shot, maybe.
I got a sack in the box,
says he owns one from a couple days ago.
White Coat Alley.
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?
Is everybody on a crusade
to make more murders
out of bullshit?
The mope's
confessing, Jay.
He walked up to
the Western desk to do it.
Well, at least when you
go to manufacturing a murder, Eddie,
you already have
a suspect in hand.
I respect that part
of your game.
Oh, that others might learn.
I need a witness for the statement
in box number one.
Yeah. Let me dump
my shit.
I'll be there.
Sodium cyanide.
You're telling me, if we do a full
tox screen on this kid,
he comes back
positive for cyanide:
Yeah. That's what
I'm saying, okay?
You need to lock me up
because I killed that boy,
I did.
I did it.
I did it.
So just-- just lock me up
and be done with it,
all right?
Where'd you get the cyanide?
You getting
sick there, Bunky?
When's the last time
you had your medicine?
No. No, I'm not
getting high anymore, okay?
Let me ask you again:
Where'd you get cyanide from?
If you're saying--
- Fuck!
- I'm sorry.
- Shit. He got my fucking sleeve.
- Just calm down.
We'll get something
to clean this up,
and maybe a soda
or something.
- Get some sugar in you at least.
- I'm sorry.
He settles down,
I'll Miranda.
Yeah.
Fuck.
Steals like
my ex-wife's lawyer.
Jesus.
Get up there.
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Give me a sec!
Call 911. The mutt in box one
just tried to hang himself.
No idea on this one.
Two on this block
and three off Lanvale.
- Hmm.
- They cluster.
And when they found a block they liked,
they came back on it.
One on the next block,
across Gilmore.
That makes nine.
Scary thing is we're only
looking at one district.
Shit. One sector.
How far you think
they might have roamed?
There's only one way
to find out.
Excuse me. Daniels.
How we doing with Forensics?
That's the colonel's domain,
but my understanding is
that we're sending
a lab team to every house.
So far we're finding
9-millimeter casings.
Once they start scoping
at the morgues,
we'll probably have slugs
to go with them.
Tracewise, we're laser-printing
around every body
and vacuuming every crime scene
for hair and fiber,
but, of course,
these are vacants.
It'll take our lab a year
to sift that many bags of dirt.
- Is this all from one drug crew?
- Probably.
- Marlo Stanfield's bunch.
- Where are we on them?
Major Crimes was working wiretaps
until three months ago,
- but we came down on those.
- Can we get backup?
Trying, but Stanfield's people
may have changed up the pattern.
Well, Colonel,
whatever you need.
Actually,
what I need is Patrol.
Patrol Division:
That was Detective Freamon
on the phone.
We found two more at Lafayette
and another on Lanvale.
Jesus Christ.
Now starting at the first scene,
we've been going door to door,
but there's no telling
how far the shooter wandered.
And with 15,000 vacants
in the city,
it'll take my people weeks
to cover that ground.
He brings this case in,
he'll be closer to the throne.
Look, I wouldn't worry
about Daniels.
He's a long way
from my chair,
as are you.
You made your move
too soon.
- I did.
- Politics doesn't suit you.
Stick to operations.
And don't you ever
cross me like that again.
Get it out
to all the bulletins.
Leander, go downtown.
Run a flier
for every roll call.
Show them the nails
and the screws in detail. All right?
You grab a couple of those nails
and hit all the hardware stores.
Find out exactly what the model is
that we're looking for.
- What do you need from me?
- Herc.
I'm serious.
Get hold of him.
- How's he looking?
- Pretty good, considering.
No worse than before
he hung himself.
The fuck are you going?
West Side.
Freamon found another.
Fucking Freamon.
He a transport:
Borderline.
B.P. and pulse are normal.
We gave him Ativan
for withdrawal.
Hey, you want to go
to a hospital?
Let me ask you something:
What kind of a fellow
rigs up a hot shot,
then walks into a police station
to talk about it?
Huh: Who does that:
- You want us to wait?
- No.
What is in your head, fella?
The hot shot was
for this motherfucker
that has been
beating on me.
And the boy?
He was dipping.
I knew he was. I--
I just didn't--
I didn't think...
The child had no one for him--
no mother, no family.
He in the street
like I'm in the street.
So I tried to...
Like I ain't know
who I am, right?
Like I'm pretending I ain't been
a dope fiend my whole damn life.
Just lock me up, man.
'Cause I killed that child.
The shot wasn't for the kid.
Let's throw this one back.
This sad-ass motherfucker's carrying
more weight than we'll ever put on him.
What about the clearance?
Fuck the clearance.
Cut him loose?
Shit, he'll go off
a roof or some shit.
My luck, I'll catch
that call too.
Maybe D ward
over at Bayview,
something with soft walls.
Is you out of
your mind, nigger?
You think I'ma pay you twice
for the same motherfucking package?
Hey, I'm in
the same box here.
Faggot took my shit
same as he took y'all's.
Man, but that's
on your own people.
Your guys was the ones doing
security on this shit.
Hey, they worked it
the same as we did
the last dozen shipments.
Y'all was fine with it
up until this, right?
Ain't no one have
a problem with it
till the motherfucker
gave us one.
Thing is, Joe, we called
a quorum on this,
took a vote that says it's your people
need to make this right.
No no, a co-op means
share and share alike.
You share the good
and you share the bad.
All right.
I'll dig deep and do the full shipment
if that's what y'all need,
But don't even think about coming
back to me for a re-up after this,
'cause when that good raw shit comes
straight off the boat,
it's gonna be mine only,
seeing as how y'all can't find the heart
to stand with me now.
You want to quorum up again,
think it over a little?
Yeah, I thought you might.
I'll get word back that we need
a fresh shipment, and right quick,
and you can think about what we need
to do to improve security,
make sure it only
happens the once.
What's up, young'un?
Which one of your people
was in charge of the stash?
I mean, I want to talk to him.
My nephew.
My sister's boy.
I can't give him up
like that.
I can't do it.
My connect had people there
when the shit went down.
If that's what you need
to make you believe,
you can hear it
straight from him.
We are rich.
That's what I'm talking about.
Butch.
My man. Mmm.
Right, now, girl, you set that off slow,
you feel me?
'Cause word gonna get around.
They gonna come back on you now.
Nah. None of that.
Yo, anybody ask about me
on another job,
tell 'em,
"Kimmy been retired."
All right?
Be easy.
How much you got left after splitting
with the Mexicans?
26 raw.
Mmm. Gracious.
Shit, only problem, man,
I'll spend the rest of my life
trying to put that
out on the street.
I ain't no drug dealer, Butch.
- You feel me?
- Hmm.
Shit, we just stole
too much this damn time.
So, what am l
gonna do, Butch?
Well...
you could come give
Joe a call.
Offer to sell the shit
back to him now
for 20c on the dollar.
Joe would have found
some humor in that.
I know you do.
I understand there's
a waiting list.
The thing is this kid has already
been in a foster home.
Right.
And now his foster mother's
been hospitalized, so--
Right. No.
Is there a supervisor
that I can talk to?
I'm gonna be a little late for
roll call. Gotta get this kid settled.
What's wrong with D.S.S.?
On the phone with them right now.
They're talking about a group home.
So? Either you come up
with a guardian,
or he goes to Social Services.
No two ways about it.
Hello: Hello:
Need your help.
Get dressed.
I'm suspended with pay,
pending a full trial board.
Can't do nothing
for no one, Kima.
Fuck what they say.
This here's police work,
and I'm asking
if you police.
All right. Listen up, you mutts.
This is complicated.
I mean, it isn't complicated
if you went to college or,
I don't know, your mothers actually
stopped drinking
for a minute
while they was pregnant.
But for Baltimore City Police,
this is complicated.
Anyway, this right here is for
the Major Crimes homicide investigation
into the bodies being found
in the vacant houses here in Western.
Command now wants
all the districts
to check every vacant
in the city.
That means you will need to go door to
door to every vacant house in your post
and look at what was used
to board it up.
Most will have the Phillips head screws
that H.C.D. uses,
Iike this here
on the flier.
But if you see a house
that's been boarded up
with nail-gun nails
like these shown here,
call your sector sergeant
immediately.
You can enter the house,
but if you find a body,
do not disturb
the crime scene. All told.
But what l
don't understand is
why they keep busting
my balls about this.
I mean, Daniels gave me
a slap on the wrist
for the thing
with the minister, right?
And Marimow got bounced just before
he could fuck me up on anything else.
You sure we
on the right block?
Yeah. Put them on the curb
right here, more or less.
And then you fired
the nail gun
into the asphalt,
right where they sat?
Yeah. Right next to
the little broad's leg.
So who tells
these l.I.D. fucks
to start running
through my paperwork,
Iooking for
who the fuck cares?
I mean, it's not like
they caught me stealing
or brutalizing motherfuckers,
right? Right?
Look.
Yeah. It looks like
it could be.
Is that about right?
Yeah.
Must have worked himself free.
I took them nails
to Ballistics.
Comparer said he could match
anything out of that gun,
and maybe the nail gun itself,
if we could get it.
I mean, I know they're
gonna take my stripes,
but you don't think they're
gonna go past that, right?
Herc, what'd you do exactly?
Lost the camera
I took from l.S.D.
without my
lieutenant's approval.
And what evidence
I got from the camera,
I put to a made-up
informant.
Son, they're gonna beat
on your white ass
Iike it's a rented mule.
Fuck.
Then make him sign it.
Did it to himself,
that cocksucker.
I hate that bastard.
He called him cocksucker.
You're gonna break
that call button.
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to bother y'all,
but I don't get but four channels.
That's all you get.
What about my man
over there?
He has insurance.
And insurance pays
for his cable hookup.
Only reason you're admitted
is that fracture.
Soon as we can
discharge you, we will.
All you gangsters
wash up in our E.R.
Iike it's your due.
You could stand out there
slinging drugs
till you get shot or cut,
have us put you
back together free of charge
so you can do it again.
- Gangster, huh?
- Oh, you're not that?
I pulled your admissions.
You were here in '90
for a gunshot wound,
and three years before that, you were
here for chest surgery for a cutting.
Long time back, yeah.
And I see
you're still at it.
Dennis Wise,
I'm Howard Colvin.
Are you police?
I... used to be,
but now I'm a bit of
a teacher up at Tilghman.
I got a little problem,
and you know Carver
over at the Western,
he said that you might
be able to help me.
I went up to your gym.
They told me what happened.
What is it that
I'm supposed to know about?
It's Namond Brice.
Yeah. What's the problem?
Oh... shit.
Well, I've just come
to care about the kid.
You heard it was
Little Kevin?
I seen one of the police step out
the household with his necklace.
That's Kevin
up in there, yo.
This motherfucker be killing niggers
just to do it.
See?
Nigger killing motherfuckers
just 'cause he can,
not 'cause they snitching,
not 'cause it's business,
but 'cause this shit
just comes natural to him.
- Yo, Bodie, man--
- I mean, Little Kevin is gone--
this nigger
don't feel nothing.
And all them motherfuckers
in them rowhouses,
- nobody mean a fucking thing to him.
- Bodie, calm the fuck down.
Fuck Marlo, man!
Fuck him
and anybody that think
it's all right to do people this way.
You hear me?
Fuck all y'all motherfuckers.
Get the fuck off me, man.
That's his friend in the bag.
It's like that nigger
ain't fit, man.
You see that shit, yo?
Go on. Lock his
dumb ass up.
Attica! Attica! Attica!
...the number of victims
discovered shot to death
in the boarded-up buildings.
How flattering for us.
It knocks the school deficit
right off the front pages.
There's your silver lining
right there.
- Those bodies are on Royce.
- School deficit should be too.
Should be, but that's a problem that's
gonna play out in the next fiscal year.
By then
you're out of Teflon.
So I take
the governor's money,
and then two years from now
when I shake the hand of any voter
in the D.C. suburbs,
they say, "All right.
You're the guy
who needed my tax dollars
to bail out
your school system."
If you take his check, you lose votes
in Prince George's and Montgomery,
and you can't beat him statewide
without the counties.
But two years from now,
if you're governor,
you can help the city
from Annapolis.
He's the mayor now.
I agree we can't fix
the city schools,
but we can't let them
get any worse either.
Go back to Annapolis.
Eat his shit.
If we lose local control
of the schools,
Nerese and the teachers
will rip you,
but the rest of the city will see
you did it for them kids.
Kids don't vote.
Taking a risk
with our supply, ain't you?
I mean, setting up a meet
with anybody other than us.
Got to.
The boy craves
reassurance.
Boss, you get that boy Marlo
in line on our connect,
he might try to go round
the co-op, go round us.
You know what I'm saying?
Cautious as those Greeks be,
who you think they gonna trust?
They know us.
They don't know him.
Damn.
Look at this nigger
coming round.
Easy, son. Easy.
Yeah. I might have known
I'd find you boys in here,
burning that oil after hours.
Nigger, I'ma
kill you twice.
Oh? So you don't want
your shipment, huh?
Say your piece.
Well, it just so happens
I got some heroin for sale.
Marketwise, you fellas
look like buyers. You feel me?
This some shameless shit.
Oh, ain't no shame
in my game, dawg.
I'm here about the business.
Ain't that right, Joe?
- How much?
- 20 on the dollar.
10, nigger.
Don't make me say 25 now.
That's 400,000.
How about we take your
faggot ass in the backroom
and get into some
diabolical brutality,
find our shit
the old-fashioned way?
- Feel me?
- Oh, I feel you.
Sounds like a plan.
I don't know though, Joe.
You think Omar gonna give it up?
20 on the dollar it is.
Say, how's she ticking, Joe?
I'll be in touch.
And he thinks
I'll help the schools,
help the city a lot more
if I'm governor
two years from now.
I'm thinking that way
it wouldn't just be about me
if I don't take the money.
Are you asking me
what I think?
I think you'll do
the right thing.
For real, I'm telling you
the truth.
Tickles.
You sure you want
to do this?
I don't want to hurt you.
Detective Crutchfield,
do you have a moment?
Yes, ma'am.
Is something wrong?
I've got a question
on these reports.
Were they all found
in the basement?
No, ma'am. We've been finding
most in the basement,
but some are on
the upper floors too.
Can you be specific
in the 24s,
for my sake anyway?
- No problem.
- Thanks.
How many so far?
- 17.
- Christ.
That's a lot of red names.
It's your first "Red Bull."
Yeah.
I thought I'd get
a nice, quiet domestic or two
to start me off.
We got national press
on this already.
You'll be fine, Rhonnie.
Just don't let any of these guys
see you sweating.
Hey, I need
a case dropped.
To tell Mello to sign off,
I need a friendly A.S.A.
He kicks out
a radio-car window,
and you wanna
give him a walk?
What's the date range
as per decomp?
The one on Mount Street
looked about a week.
Some a few days,
some are skeletal
at this stage.
They all head shots?
Multiples, most of them.
- Black males, 1 5 to 25?
- Uh-huh.
No, some older.
We got one in a security guard's uniform
around here somewhere.
- You laser-print?
- Mm-hmm.
Vacuum the rooms?
Yes.
Gluco for blood?
What's the geography?
13 on West Side, Baltimore to
Winchester, Schroeder to the Grove.
The Eastern boys found four more
in the houses on Monument Street.
- East Side?
- Yeah. That threw us.
We're casting a wider net now,
searching the vacants citywide.
My number's 23
in the office pool.
I still have hope.
Hell of a case, right here.
You know, if I was police,
I don't think
I could lean back
on it. You?
Not if I was real police.
Right.
Thank you, Detective.
Calvin, you done already?
Yeah, I'm done.
Attention, a reminder:
Answer sheets must be turned
into the office by you and only you
immediately upon
completion of the tests.
Thank you
for your cooperation.
Where are we
on the nail gun?
A Hilti DX model.
High end, but common
among contractors.
Is it what Sergeant Hauk saw
in the back of Chris Partlow's truck?
We showed him one,
and he thought so.
Then we dragged his ass back down
to the block where he did the car stop.
- Anything?
- We found what might be a hole
where he said
he fired into the street,
but no nail, even after sweeping
the block
with metal detectors.
Probably took a ride
in some bastard's radio,
but now it's
in a tire pile somewhere.
So our next move is a search
and seizure on that truck.
Along with a court order
for hair and blood
from Chris and Snoop both.
With everything we're
pulling out these houses,
we might get lucky
with some tracework.
- What's your P.C.?
- Herc sees the nail gun.
Nothing wrong with owning
a power tool.
What's the P.C. on Chris
and Snoop specifically?
A witness--
the boy who was told by a co-conspirator
who the murderer was.
The boy is a source.
He's not a witness.
If he's just a source,
you don't have enough.
No, but with the links that we got
between some of these bodies
and Stanfield and his organization,
we have a pattern.
Weak. Very weak.
Oh, fuck it.
Give me an hour.
You haven't left me alone
all week.
Every time I come out
of the pool,
you want to dry me off
without a towel.
- Dennis Wise.
- Hey, man.
Yeah. Were you able
to get some word?
On my say-so, he's willing
to sit and hear you out.
But what you asking him for--
I don't know.
Good luck, though.
If you see
my man Carver again,
you tell him
he owe me one now.
- All right, man. Appreciate it.
- You got it, bro.
All right.
Y'all coming back
with a warrant?
The roughneck
in room 232.
From what I know, he runs
a gym program for kids.
He got himself shot for trying to pull
a kid off the corner.
Look, you need to
speak up now,
or face the fact
that you never spoke at all.
They wouldn't let me
see my son at marches.
Said there wasn't much left
by the time y'all found him.
We did the best we could
with the information we had.
Word come to me
that a man named Chris
and a girl
named Loop or Snoop
or some such
took my son and killed him.
Told me I would never
see my boy again.
Why can't you just make
an exception in this case
and move his name
to the top of the list,
see that he gets
another foster parent?
The list is the list.
Some clients have been
in group homes for years.
He was in group homes
for years.
- Now he's gotta go back because--?
- Please don't raise your voice.
- If you're going to raise your voice--
- Please.
There's gotta be some way
that he doesn't have to go--
Yeah, there is.
There's gotta be.
How about--
how about if I take him
as a foster parent?
The screening process
takes three to four months.
This child can't be
in your custody, Sergeant.
He needs to come back under
our supervision per the juvenile order.
Think you all that for hassling niggers
and shit?
I know I'm all that.
I'm thinking
about some pussy.
- Yeah. Me too.
- Mm-hmm.
They dumped their tools.
Nothing under the seats.
Nothing in the glove box.
Registered to some little
old lady, no doubt.
These guys know the drill.
Can you see
these two riding tail?
Come on.
Aw, shit.
There it is.
Whoa.
Uh-huh.
It ain't even our truck.
But I need
to hear it from you.
From me:
This is not my affair, huh?
It is what Joe says.
I'm only here right now for Joe,
who I trust,
who I respect,
who I worked with
for many years.
You I do not know,
and I don't need to know.
But because this thing
goes wrong for Joe, then--
Well, how am I supposed to know
this ain't no setup?
How am I supposed to know
your people ain't in on it too?
You know because Joe says
and because I say.
And you trust
your people like that?
I talked to my driver.
I looked into his soul.
Chris and Snoop
just been popped
on a gun charge,
found in the truck.
Call the bondsman.
But first, put a follow
on him right there.
- Who, white dude with the hat on?
- Mm-hmm.
- What, he a problem?
- Nah.
I just need to know more.
- All right.
- All right.
Satisfied?
$90,000 to you
in the morning.
We'll put a hunt
on Omar later,
after the heat on them
empty houses gives way.
The fuck
are you doing here?
You think that charge
gets dropped without
somebody showing you
some special love?
You hungry?
Come on.
All right.
Might be surety bond
on this Chris Partlow,
given all of his priors.
Pearson woman--
not so much. All right?
What's this?
Court order.
We get blood and hair.
14 head hairs,
14 body hairs,
two blood samples each.
It's a lot of houses,
a lot of deeds.
Who knows what
you left behind?
We still
in the city?
Cylburn Arboretum.
Pimlico's right
up the hill.
This is nice.
I ain't no snitch.
I didn't say you were.
I've been doing this
a long time.
I ain't never said
nothing to no cop.
I feel old.
I been out there
since I was 13.
I ain't never fucked up a count,
never stole off a package,
never did some shit
that I wasn't told to do.
I've been straight up.
But what come back:
Hmm? You think if I get
jammed up on some shit,
they'd be like, "All right,
yeah. Bodie been there.
Bodie hang tough.
We got his pay lawyer.
We got a bail."
They want me to stand
with them, right?
But where the fuck they at, when they
supposed to be standing by us?
I mean, when shit goes bad
and there's hell to pay,
where they at?
This game is rigged, man.
We like the little bitches
on a chessboard.
Pawns.
Yo, I'm not snitching
on none of my boys--
not my corner,
and not no Barksdale people,
or what's left of them.
But Marlo-- this nigger
and his kind, man,
they gotta fall.
They gotta.
Well, for that to happen,
somebody's gotta step up.
I'll do what I gotta.
I don't give a fuck.
Just don't ask me to live
on my fucking knees, you know?
You're a soldier, Bodie.
Hell, yeah.
I remember you.
You used to be a roll-up
on Pennsie and Fremont.
Yeah. It was my old post.
- I came up with C.B.S.
- Calhoun, Baker, Stricker.
Yeah. I used to have to
bang up on y'all all the time.
I remember that too.
Yeah. I ain't a cop
now, right?
I mean,
like I told Cutty,
I'm sort of like
a teacher now,
and that's how I come
to know Namond.
Only reason I'm even here
is Cutty spoke for you.
He say what I'm asking?
Your boy...
is smart and funny
and open-hearted,
and he got
some flex in him.
And I ain't see it at first,
'cause he was always acting out,
always full up
of corner talk--
you know, just talking
shit to hide himself.
But he could go
a lot of places
and do a lot of things
in his life,
be out there in the world
in a way that, you know,
didn't happen
for you and me.
I mean, you know,
our kind? Shit.
Man, we both know we gonna go
to our grave forever knowing
what block Bentalou
dead-ends at,
or who got their liquor license over
at the Underground,
or what corner Tater man
got shot on
when he come out the Musical Lounge
back in '88.
It's a vision in gold.
The West Side we knew--
it's dead, man.
You know, people
in the game nowadays--
I mean, it's a whole
different breed--
no code, no family,
and damn sure no respect.
I mean, you send Namond
out on the corner now,
I'm giving him
maybe one, two years
before he
down at the morgue.
And maybe, if you're lucky,
up here with you.
Maybe, maybe not.
That's the game.
I'm talking about
Namond here, Mr. Brice.
He's a lot of things,
a lot of good things.
I mean, before you know, he might
surprise all of us given half a chance,
but he ain't made
for them corners, man.
I mean, not like we were.
That's why
I come down here--
because I gotta believe
that you see it,
being who you are
and all you've been through.
You know your son.
It's in your hands, man.
You asking too much.
Yeah, but I'm asking.
You sure it was
the boy Bodie?
Man, I seen him come from
out the Central Booking
over on Eager Street side.
Then he got in some car
with some white dude.
Police? What kind of car,
a Caprice?
No, a hooptie, I think.
They on you like
a motherfucker.
They jacking you up, pulling all your
work out them houses, right?
Man, we can't have nobody
snitching on us now.
We ain't sure it's that.
What, you wanna let it go?
Risk it:
Huh-uh. Send a message.
Maybe give it to your pup,
get him started.
You and Snoop,
y'all lay low
till this shit here
blow down.
Boy worked for Bodie.
First time, best be
someone he ain't know.
You hear what Joe said?
Joe's saying this cocksucker
who stole our shit
wanna sell it back to us
for 30 on the dollar.
Joe's saying it's another
90 to buy back our share.
Dag, yo.
Thought you forgot
about me.
Hey, why don't you
wait outside, all right?
You spoke to his father?
If it goes the way I think,
he'll be back with his mom
by tomorrow.
Big day all around tomorrow.
Delegate Watkins got us 30 minutes
at the mayor's office.
Icicles!
Get 'em while it's going!
Icicles!
Come on!
Yo, Spider,
what's the count?
I don't even think we gonna
sell out today, man.
Yo, Bodie.
Yo,
Bodie.
Icicles! Icicles!
Yo, Bodie,
you better run, yo.
Yo, this my corner.
I ain't running nowhere.
Bodie, is you crazy?
Shit is on!
Run with it,
motherfuckers!
I don't give a fuck!
I'm right here!
You ain't putting me up in one of them
empty-ass houses, neither.
Bodie, come on, man.
I don't know about this.
Mayor's office.
Yes. Actually, you want
the Department of Housing
and Community Development.
Look, I don't know
about this, man.
I just...
Ma'am...
if...
sorry.
If the mayor
prefers not to--
if he, like, feels more comfortable
with Dr. Parenti alone, you know,
because of the drug-legalization
controversy last year...
I don't think Mayor Carcetti
is in your meeting.
He's in Annapolis.
Okay. Thank you.
- What up?
- What up?
Still asleep?
Early bird get that worm.
How you liking the crib?
Fine, thanks.
Must feel good to be
on your own.
Yo, where you get
that ring from?
Took it from a nigger.
Why? You want it?
Nah nah.
You keep it, Shorty.
I'll go get Bug
ready for school.
You ready to put in work?
Two things then:
First, we're gonna give you
the corner up on Payson.
Used to be Bodie's old corner.
Now it's yours.
Crew that up.
Run that shit.
You get the points
on that shop.
Then we got
this other thing.
Yo, if I ain't
stepping on nothing,
who was that
who dropped for you, yo?
- Bug's daddy.
- Word?
That's not how you spell
"paraphernalia."
- How the fuck do you spell it?
- Hey, fellas.
Not like that.
McNulty. Hey.
You're here 4:00 to 12:00,
right?
- You heard about Bodie?
- What about?
- Bodie, from up Payson.
- Yeah yeah. What?
Shot dead on his corner.
Midnight shift caught it.
Check the readout.
Sergeant,
get your ass in here.
God damn it, Sergeant,
you're on the brink of insubordination.
You call D.S.S. right now
and ship him out. That's an order.
Lieutenant--
I got $235, if it helps.
How would that help:
Maybe we can get a foster spot
like that-- pay somebody.
This is tracking,
plain and simple.
No, it's a
socialization process.
But to any parent who complains,
you're still segregating them.
But I mean...
it's for their benefit,
and for the benefit of
the teachers trying to teach.
And you're proposing to expand this
to every middle school?
With enough grant money
and your support, yes.
By September.
But you wouldn't be teaching
test curriculum here?
These would be the children
left behind, so to speak.
Yeah, but as it is,
I mean,
we're leaving
them all behind anyway.
We just don't want
to admit it.
- What we mean to say is--
- Gentlemen...
we'll be in touch.
So what, that's it?
After a two-minute hearing,
they stick a fork in us?
I'm a liability
in there, man.
Seems like every time
I open my mouth in this town,
I'm telling people something
they don't want to know.
- It's not you. It's the process.
- The process?
When we get the grant, we study
the problem, we propose solutions.
If they listen, they listen.
If they don't, it still
makes for great research.
What we publish on this
is gonna get a lot of attention.
From who:
From other
researchers, academics.
Academics?
What, they gonna study
your study?
When do this shit change?
And you put him out, huh?
He need to get hard.
Well, if he out,
then he out.
Oh, no, you're not.
You ain't gonna take
my son away from me, not for this--
Remember who the fuck
you talking to right here.
Remember who I am.
My word is still my word.
In here, in Baltimore,
and in any place you
can think of calling home,
it'll be my word.
They'll find you.
Man come down here to say my son
can be anything he damn please.
Except a soldier.
Yeah, well,
look at me up in here.
Who the fuck
would want to be that
if they could be
anything else, De'Londa?
Hmm:
So...
did you cut me off too?
You still got me.
We'll get by.
But you gonna
let go of that boy.
Bet that.
Quien es?
It's Omar, baby.
For your bank?
That's for
your pain, Butch.
I be my own bank now.
Hmm.
They ain't follow you?
Nah.
Joe paid it my way.
He had to admit my word
was better than his. You feel me?
Let's go then.
He is in the van,
in the garage
in the back
of 2249 Polk Street.
The key gonna be
in the cinderblock.
You steal this much,
and this ain't over.
This ain't over.
Thing about that
Republican ass,
it's not the flesh of
his political fathers.
Jesus.
You left it
on the table.
Smug son of a bitch.
He was gonna
make me beg,
then call
a press conference
so the world could see me
on my knees.
Don't worry.
Two years,
and we'll make him pay.
Icicle, icicle!
Got those icicles!
Shakedown!
Corner's indicted.
Go on. Get.
Except you, motherfucker.
On the wall.
Sorry about Bodie.
I ain't jacking you up.
I'm trying to do right
for your boy.
- Who dropped him?
- Y'all did.
They took him out 'cause
he was talking to y'all.
Word is they seen him with the police
down at Central Booking.
So cuff me or kick my ass
off this corner
before you do me the same.
Hey, Duquan.
Don't you need
to be at Douglass?
I'm on my way there, yeah.
Where's your book bag?
Oh, it's-- I'm gonna stop
past the house and get it.
It's a present
for all you did.
It's for your desk.
That's great, Duquan.
Thanks.
Stop past anytime,
Iet me know
how it's going with you.
Okay.
- But I ain't want to go back.
- Program's ending, Zenobia.
Yeah, boy.
Back to gen pop.
Yes.
Pack my bags.
What about you?
I mean, this was all right...
but maybe it's time.
Why are you up?
You're working
4:00 to 12:00.
What's the matter?
Something with these bodies.
Lester and them
are getting up on it.
It's under Daniels.
He's got suction now.
He can deliver.
You want in.
I just feel like
I owe it now.
To who:
To this kid.
Corner kid.
Getting ready
to turn him, you know,
wrap him up and give him
to Lester as a present.
He one of the bodies
in the houses:
No, they dropped him
in the street.
Maybe I'd be different,
you know?
Different:
Yeah, no more of the...
drinking and the whoring
and all that.
All that anger.
'Cause I'm better now
here with you.
No more playing "Jimmy Bust Balls"
with the world.
"Jimmy Bust Balls"?
I swear to God, Beadie,
that son of a bitch nearly killed me.
It's okay.
- What?
- You tried.
You don't need to feel bad.
Thanks.
All right, Randy,
this way.
Take that top bunk
over there.
Five-0.
Are you sure?
I'm not asking
'cause I can't use you.
I'm asking for your sake.
I think I can do this
and keep myself
away from myself,
if that makes any sense.
But I gotta tell you,
we're not gonna get
Marlo Stanfield
or anyone else above the street,
not on street rips.
What do you suggest?
Either a wide C.I.
or a Title lll.
That's what makes this case.
You sure?
Maybe you do this fast
and clean and simple.
Then you don't
do it at all.
Chain of command, Colonel.
How in the hell do we
kick up percentages
in math
and reading both?
You believe the numbers?
38% proficient.
8% advanced.
What?
"Proficient" means they're
at least two grades below their level.
"Advanced" can mean
they're at grade level or a year below.
They score 'em
like that, and...
they say we're
making progress.
Okay. I'm still learning.
Nah, you're gonna be fine.
Albert, Zenobia, Namond,
good to have you
back with us.
Yeah. Your worst nightmare
come right back on you.
Say, no,
I'm just foolin'.
Okay.
Everyone open to 121.
Who figured out
the first problem?
- Kareem?
- 164.
Correct.
How'd you get it?
- Don't know.
- Come. Show us.
Just when you
think you're done.
- What's that one? 20?
- 22.
Anybody heard from Bunk?
Ballistics say the guns match
to nothing. Opened and closed.
And they cleaned
the prints.
Well, maybe
we find a witness.
Maybe trace lab gives us
a hair or splatter or something.
But short of that,
we're gonna have to go proactive.
Where are you
on the new body?
Back to square one.
We're in here
for the long haul.
Colonel, how'd you happen
to pick this place for us to stage?
- Lemel:
- Hmm.
They closed it
a few years back,
and I knew it was near
a lot of our crime scenes.
I went to school here
back in the day.
Got a decent education,
now that I think on it.
You try and talk to him?
Didn't know what to say.
Only heard from
my sergeant this morning.
Guess I missed
the 24 they wrote on it.
And he really tried
to do himself?
It wasn't just
for show or nothing?
Bub's got some problems,
but insincerity ain't one of them.
Shame's some
tricky shit, ain't it?
Makes you feel like
you want to change,
and then beats you back down
when think you can't.
When was the last time
y'all talked?
More than a couple of years,
since he last got
on the wagon, I think.
If he's up in D ward,
he's cleaner than
a motherfucker right now.
You coming?
Maybe later.
Can't believe he'd leave
that money on the table.
- Why not?
- School. Kids.
Shit.
You ain't done enough
of this here, I suppose.
They always disappoint.
Closer you get,
more you look--
all of them.
Who you going with
next year?
If he tries for Elijah's seat,
I might stay with Royce.
If not, there's this young buck
out in Salisbury
thinks he can snatch up
the First District seat.
Hmm.
Mistletoe. Come get 'em.
Mistletoe!
You can look him
in the eye now.
No matter who he is
or what he's done,
you look him
right in the eye.
I'm still your father.
What you want?
Right to the body.
That's right. Keep it moving.
Where your eyes at?
Where you looking--
what you looking at?
Hey!
You cannot be out here.
Y'all need to find
something constructive
to do with yourselves.
Go on.
Michael.
Michael.
The gun.
Na', you're
gonna be late.
Go on. Go.
Boy, where's your plate?
Yo, Tyrell, wait up.
I dunno, man.
I mean, I'm kinda sad.
Them towers be home to me.
You gonna cry over
a housing project, now?
Man, they shoulda blew them motherfuckers up
a long time ago, you ask me.
Man, it ain't all been bad.
I mean, I been seen some shit happen up
in them towers it still make me smile, yo.
A few moments from now,
the Franklin Terrace towers behind me,
which sadly came to represent
some of the city's most entrenched problems,
will be gone.
Ya'll talkin' about steel
and concrete, man.
- Steel and fucking concrete.
- Man, I'm talkin' about people.
Memories an' shit.
Ain't the same.
Look, they gonna tear this building down,
they gonna build some new shit.
But people?
They don't give
a fuck about people.
You are very soon
going to see low
and moderately priced houses
built in their place.
My cousins used
to live in 2-2-1.
- I used to be up in there all the time.
- Ma who you tellin'?
I caught my first
pussy up in there.
The girl Chantay.
Man, why didn't you
say something before?
They probably wouldn't be
tearin' this tower down now.
They gonna put a big-ass
sign in front sayin'
"here's where Malik Carr
first got his dick wet".
You know what I'm sayin'.
Poot, you can be takin' pictures,
tourists takin' pictures an' shit,
souvenirs of your dick
about this size.
He ain't funny, yo,
he just jealous.
What? Jealous of that?
You crazy, Chantay?
Man, the mention of that
bitch make my dick burn.
Yo, ain't no bad pussy, fool.
Yeah, that's what they keep tellin'
your ass down at the clinic, man.
Keep that shit up.
You ever see this motherfucker
when he walkin' down to the clinic burnt?
Poot be like this.
He looks like a backward
ass cowboy an' shit.
Instead of like this.
Only he walkin' like this.
Dick lookin' like
a fried chicken wing.
Mistakes have been made.
And we will learn
from those mistakes.
Reform is not just a watchword
with my administration, unh-huh,
no, it's a philosophy.
Shit, no matter how many
times you get burnt, man,
you just keep on
doin' the same.
Nigger do not learn.
Now, what do you say, huh?
Are you ready
for a new Baltimore?
Shit gonna be off
the hook, yo.
Man, my whole life been
around them towers, you know.
I mean I feel.
Shit, I feel like
I don't got no home now.
Housing just moved your mama
up off Poplar Prove, didn't they?
You ain't homeless,
nigga, you got a home.
Shit, you just damn
near outta work is all.
What you mean?
I mean look all over the city,
even out in the county,
you had people, coke or dope,
24/7, where was it they go?
Man, look, you live in the
projects, you ain't shit.
But you sling product there.
You got the game
by the ass, man.
Shit.
Now these downtown,
suit-wearin' ass bitches
just snatched up the best
territory in the city from y'all.
You wanna cry over
some shit, cry over that.
Alright, everyone,
count with me.
Ten

five
four
three

one!
<i>Oh shit. </i>
Time After Time
Fuck.
I just stepped
in dogshit, man.
You hope.
<i>Is it Cheese,
can you see him?</i>
<i>Yo, where he at?</i>
<i>Who you mean?</i>
<i>Cheese, I'm lookin'
for Cheese, man. </i>
<i>Nigga, you ain't supposed to be
droppin' names an' shit. </i>
<i>Ain't you got no sense?</i>
<i>I ain't say shit
about shit, man. </i>
<i>I'm jus' lookin'
to get together with the man. </i>
<i>Need to see him
about nuthin' at all. </i>
<i>So he be
where he be, fool. </i>
<i>Is he at the place
that we was at?</i>
<i>'Cause I'm lookin' to,
you know, saddle up</i>
<i>and then put another bat
on this motherfucker. </i>
<i>He need to feel
with me today,</i>
<i>or I'ma take it to someone
who can handle them, man. </i>
<i>- It's nothin' you let him know.
- A-ight. </i>
"Saddle up an' put another
bat on the motherfucker?"
"Settle" up
and put another "bet".
But what was that last part?
Man said, "he need
to deal with me today
or I'ma take it to
someone who can handle them. "
Girl, you do have an ear.
<i>He lookin'
to get with him. </i>
<i>A-ight. </i>
<i>- Same thing as before?
- Same thing I tell 'em. </i>
<i>A-ight. </i>
What'r you seeing?
Call comes in
to Cheese's number two,
he whispers in the man's
ear and off they go.
Yeah.
Nothing to the call here.
<i>Figured that. </i>
These guys come correct.
The phones only go so far,
above that, it's all done
as a face-to-face meet.
Three months and we've
yet to hear his voice.
And Herc takes the alley
to cut that off from Calhoun.
So, me an' Truck go up the wrong
way on Stricker Street?
You gotta badge, remember?
And we're doing
the same one block over.
So they can't go to ground
in that block neither.
Now the thing is when we jump
out on these little cocksuckers,
there'll be
a designated runner.
Who's gonna sky up just so
we get to chase his ass.
But fuck him.
We let him go and jack every
other motherfucker who stays.
Let's mount up.
Carv.
He's a complicated man.
And the only one who
understands him is his woman.
Seek therapy.
Narcos! Back off!
See your hands.
See your hands.
Against the wall.
Hands up. Get your hands up.
Get your hands up against the wall.
<i>There he goes. </i>
Later son, step light!
Yo, was that the stash?
Fuck.
Let's go, let's go,
cut him off at Stricker!
<i>I've got Calhoun. </i>
<i>Where you at?</i>
Lost him.
Rear Stricker 800 block.
Clear on Riggs.
He just went across Stricker
in an alley headed for Gilmore.
Fuck.
We have rabbit in the alleys
near Gilmore and Riggs.
How bout some back up?
<i>Roger that. </i>
<i>Dozerman, what's your 20?</i>
<i>Hey, Doze,
where you at, man?</i>
<i>He's across Stricker,
definitely. </i>
Everybody to Lambert's 20.
Who's the man who would risk
his neck for his brother man?
<i>He went to ground
in this block, man. </i>
Hey, listen to me you little
fuckin' piece of shit!
I'ma tell you one thing,
and one thing only
about the Western boys
you are playing with!
We do not lose!
And we do not forget!
And we do not give up!
Ever!
So I'm only going
to say this one time:
If you march your ass
out here right now
and put the bracelets on,
we will not kick
the living shit out of you!
But if you make us go
into them weeds for you,
or if you make us come back
out here tomorrow night,
catch you on a corner.
I swear to fucking Christ
we will beat you longer
and harder than you
beat your own dick!
'Cause you do not
get to win, shitbird!
We do!
With these towers down,
we need to take
the rest of them low-rises
an' all them Fayette
Street corners.
Take 'em?
Take 'em how, Mr. Bodie?
Ya say fuck it and take 'em.
Nigga, you ain't
got the floor.
The chair don't
recognize your ass.
Take 'em how?
I dunno, just...
let them Fayette
niggers know,
you know,
we serious, right?
You know, get or get got.
Yeah, yeah, like you did
on McCulloh Street last year?
Snatch the real estate,
load up,
and just wait for some
shit to happen, right?
Naw, man, we done worryin'
about territory, man.
What corner we got,
what project?
Game ain't about that no more.
It's about product.
Yeah.
And we got the best
goddamn product
so we gonna sell no matter
where we are, right?
Product, motherfuckers.
Product.
Chair recognize Slim Charles.
Chair, our people got to stand
somewhere, don't it?
I mean, all the product
in the world don't mean nothin'
if you constantly
getting your ass whooped
for standin' on another
fool's corner.
A- ight.
We had six of the towers
of the Terrace right,
all running 24/7,
but three of those we had
to give to Prop Joe's people
to upgrade the package
that we was
puttin' out there, right?
Now how much you think
we lost in the deal?
Alright, the answer
is we made more.
Half the real estate,
twice the product.
And our profit went up
like eight, nine percent.
Yo, get it straight.
Your territory ain't gonna mean
shit if your product's weak.
Go ahead and ask
them motherfuckers
tryin' to sell them Ford Tempos
an' you got niggas ridin' around
in Japanese and German cars
in America all day.
Territory ain't shit.
Especially when you consider
it's the fight
for the territory
that be bringin' the bodies.
And the bodies that
bring the police.
Yeah, but how
we gonna stand...
Yo, chair ain't
recognize your ass, man.
- How we gonna stand on some...
- Come on, man.
How we gonna stand on some
corner that's not ours?
Well, we got
the best product, right?
So the chances are,
we gonna be able to bring in
the competition by offering the
re-up with us from our package.
Feel me?
Everybody makin' money,
sharing the real estate.
Slim Charles?
What if they don't
cop our re-up though?
Well, I'ma worry about
that when it happen.
Until then, Mr. Charles,
we gonna handle this shit
like businessmen.
Sell the shit,
make the profit and later
for that gangster bullshit.
Yeah?
Do the chair
know we gonna look
like some punk-ass
bitches out there?
Motherfucker, I will punk
your ass for sayin' such shit!
- Yo, String.
- What?!
Poot did have the floor, man.
Shut the fuck up, man!
This nigga too ignorant
to have the fuckin' floor.
Y'all niggas need to start
lookin' at the world
in a new fucking light.
Start thinkin' about this shit
like some grown fucking men,
not some niggas
off the fuckin' corner.
You heard me?
Adjourn your asses.
Y'all look like shit.
We been stuck in that
vacant since before dawn.
How should we look?
Proud to know you, Detective.
Nice look on you.
Dress for success.
I watched that motherfucker
Cheese take re-ups,
move weight all day
and not once did he go
near a fucking telephone.
Closest it comes
is a call to a hanger-on's
cellphone 10 feet away.
Which brings me back
to what I was just discussing
with the Lieutenant.
So far, we've been up
on some of these cellphones
for nearly six months,
the only drug talk we have
is from street-level small fry.
So, the feeling is
that maybe two weeks from now,
we don't go back to the court
for another extension.
<i>We charge what we have,
we try to roll someone up</i>
<i>at Cheese or one of Joe's
other lieutenants. </i>
Are you kidding?
We don't have
a case worth making yet.
And at this rate,
we never will.
For chrissake.
<i>As a plan on paper
it was a good one:</i>
We came out of
the port investigation
with good phone numbers
for some of Prop Joe's people
and the P.C. To get up
on those phones.
I guarantee if we can push
this thing a level or two
above the street we're gonna
start seeing Prop Joe himself.
We start seeing Joe,
we're gonna see Stringer.
I can't ask for more time
on a wire that's going nowhere.
Either we figure a way
to punch through the wall,
or we let it go.
<i>- Baker.
- Yes, Sir. </i>
<i>So you must be Castor. </i>
Yes, Sir.
Officer Aaron Castor.
<i>You any kin
to Lloyd Castor?</i>
Yes, Sir, that's my uncle.
<i>Good police. </i>
Do you know where you are?
You too. Where are you?
The Western, Major?
Right this very goddamn second
you're getting your
hindparts kicked
and you're on the horn
screaming for help.
And you got your backup
lookin' all over the place,
'cause you don't know
where the fuck you are.
And that means I got
to explain to your next of kin
how you went and got
yourselves killed on my watch.
Sir, we're at 1034 North Mount,
first floor rear.
Good.
Now which way's north?
Point.
That's east.
Now, don't you think
if you're in a foot pursuit,
it might help
your backup to know
what direction
you're running?
Even numbers tell you
north and west,
odd, south and east.
Compasses.
'Til you learn that much,
you carry one.
Welcome to the Western.
<i>Gentlemen?
Scuff yourselves up a little. </i>
And learn the stare.
Hey Carv, where you at?
I'm at a desk outside
the roll call room
on the first floor of
1034 North Mount.
And my feet
are facing west
and my dick is
pointing south, southwest.
Bunny Colvin's been
giving that speech
as long as you guys
been sucking air.
Where you at, shitbird?
You're in handcuffs,
in my house,
lookin' stupid, ain't you?
Fleeing and eluding?
Do we have
a drug charge here?
Loitering in a designated
drug-free zone.
Let me re-phrase.
Do we have drugs?
He raised up when we hit his
corner and he grabbed this bag.
We pursued
and recovered the bag.
But no drugs.
An' they whipped my ass.
The Western District way.
So, what do we learn?
Using half my district,
canine and the copter
to bring a 14-year-old
to bay, what did we learn?
That you can't raise up
and run from a drug corner
in sector one without
my boot finding your ass.
Right?
I got it, I got it, I got it.
Got it, got it, got it.
Cast-iron. 20 at least.
It be better if it was copper.
Be better if it was copper.
It be better if it was gold.
But you know you got to
take life as it goes along,
you know?
Oh shit, oh shit.
- What's wrong with you!?
- Sorry.
You past sorry.
Chill, chill.
We don't mean this, man.
You think you fucked up now.
S'up?
Look what they
did to my ride.
Do it or don't.
But I got someplace to be.
Thank you for your kindness.
<i>Y'all got to
pay something, anything!</i>
<i>Be a principle here. </i>
If we had a dime,
you would have a dime.
We a little insufficient
right now, okay?
We on our way
to the metal man.
We'll come back and pay for
everything I promise you.
Hey, hey, after this junk, man,
we gotta rolpast K-Mart.
Definitely.
One last question,
Commissioner.
Looking back over
the past couple months,
if I read the felony
breakdowns correctly,
you've been seeing
an uptick in shootings
and serious assaults in
the Eastern District especially.
Can we assume that you're
already addressing this?
Let me throw
that over to Bill.
As Deputy for Operations,
I'm sure he's got
a handle on our response.
I do indeed.
In answer to your question,
Councilman,
I can assure you that we put
additional tactical teams
on a seven-to-three shift
in every eastern sector.
Additionally, we've put
the district flex squad
on a seven-to-three shift
being as those are the hours
when we're seeing a spike
in aggravated assaults.
Thank you, Deputy.
Anything else for
these esteemed constables?
No?
Okay, then I guess
I'll see you all tomorrow night
for the quarterly budget review.
Erv, hey, you don't mind,
I'd like to get with
you about a couple things.
Can we get lunch?
Glad to, Mr. Chairman.
How 'bout Werner's
in half hour?
Half hour. Good.
- You see Watkins in the back?
- Yeah.
Who's that skirt with him?
<i>That's him there
in the orange?</i>
<i>That's Drac. </i>
Our last best hope.
The talkingest motherfucker
I ever heard on a wiretap.
Listen.
<i>No, no, the other thing.
The other thing, nigga. </i>
<i>You talkin' about him. </i>
<i>No, her, I mean her. </i>
<i>Oh. </i>
<i>Cocaine, nigga,
you feel me now?</i>
<i>Goddamn, you ignorant. </i>
When was the last time
you heard that on a wire?
Shame he doesn't report
to anyone who matters.
Right now, Drac's reups
are with Lavell Manns,
he's got those corners
over on Preston and Bond.
And is pretty close
to selling us weight.
No shit.
Sydnor's been working toward him
for a couple of months now.
Lavell's a soldier.
He's not gonna
roll up on Prop Joe.
That's true.
But if we take him off
with a hand-to-hand,
they gotta promote
someone to replace him.
Why Drac?
One thing about our boy?
That's Prop Joe's nephew.
On his momma's side.
20 and two.
Y'all know you
ain't got pants?
And there's Dominic
standing in line,
and when he finally
gets up to meet the President,
who's looking the other way,
Dominic reaches
around behind Carter,
grabs his belt, yanks it up...
secret service musta shit.
He says, "hey, Mister
President, remember me?"
And Carter,
actually remembers,
"sure, Dominic Dipietro
from Baltimore,
on the campaign trail".
And Dominic
doesn't miss a beat.
He puts a finger in Jimmy
Carter's face and says,
"so where's that money you
promised me three years ago
to fix up my streets
and alleys?"
Unbelievable.
That's nothing.
After losing to Reagan,
Carter comes back here
to speak at a Jefferson-Jackson
dinner or something,
and Dominic's
ushered up to him.
Carter asks about
his health and Dominic says:
"You sonofabitch,
I'm still waiting on that money
for my streets and alleys".
- Come on.
- No shit.
Carter's just grinning
through those big teeth,
some guy grabs Dominic's arm,
and off he goes.
Guy says, "christ, Dominic,
you just called
"the President of
the United States an S.O.B."
He shrugs he says, "fuck 'im,
I don't need him. He lost. "
That's good. That is good.
And that is from whence I come,
proud son of the fighting
first district.
But the truth is...
I don't wanna be just another
muldoon like Dominic Dipietro,
warming the backbench.
Not with the way things
are right now in the city.
We're losing 10, 12,000
residents a year
and when you ask 'em why
they're moving to the county,
you know what they say?
Schools.
And crime.
Schools and crime
and there goes our tax base
right across the line.
And the Mayor's acting
like a 10% bump
in the murder rate
is business as usual.
Check, please?
And you know what?
If you were smart, you'd come
to me when the Mayor shorts you.
On hiring, on equipment,
on overtime, on cars.
You get the shit end
of the stick,
you come to me.
Not publicly.
I know you can't cross
the Mayor publicly.
But back door, you come to me
and I can use that subcommittee
to give you what you need.
Thanks.
Kind offer.
Erv, I can help you
and we can turn this thing...
but long ago, when I was just
starting out in the department
I had the good fortune
to be taught
a little something
about chain of command.
And right now,
in my capacity as
Acting Commissioner,
I report to Mayor Royce.
I got your coffee.
Leave a tip if you want.
<i>So, what do you need
to see me for?</i>
Gettin' out tomorrow, right?
Yeah.
He probably
tryin' to reach out.
What you
gonna do first?
Huh?
Tomorrow, what you gonna do?
I dunno.
I know what be first.
You don't know?
I know what be first.
Time out.
<i>Back in. </i>
Short-timer.
You only got
the one day left, huh.
You done the one,
just got to do the other.
Like they say...
you only do two days.
- It's the day you go in.
- The day you come out.
I don't know, I did 14 years.
Yeah, well,
you know you did you
a little stretch there, true.
But you still
a soldier, right?
You know them towers
came down now, huh?
The Terrace,
the Murphy homes.
All that shit is gone, man.
A lot of things are different
now since you been up in here.
You'll see.
Lotta changes.
Yeah, no doubt.
But I mean you know, shit,
some things they
stay the same, man.
I mean,
the game's the game.
And the thing is,
since the towers gone,
I'm gonna need to take
my thing to some new places.
Feel me?
You know I'ma be home
soon enough, right?
First parole hearing, I'm out.
For real.
Shit is fixed right.
I come home.
Shit, there's gonna be
a little hell to be paid.
You know, what I mean?
A good soldier ain't
gonna lack for work.
Take that number, man.
When you out, you call.
We'll hook you up,
man, no problem.
Like a coming-home
gift, a-ight.
Call it.
Joint mighta broke him.
Boss, you talkin' about
a homey walked up
an' shot Elijah Davis
in broad daylight
at Pennsie and Gold,
then picked up the phone,
dialed 9-1-1, told the police,
"I just shot a nigger,
come get him".
And do they break him?
Naw.
Look we had the 20, you know,
we had to go buy some pants,
so if you just take
this short money,
we get back at you
tomorrow, man.
We get you on the comeback.
He want two for 16.
<i>Tell him to get two.
Tell him to get two. </i>
<i>This young motherfucker. </i>
Naw.
You see we
a little short now,
but tomorrow, I be right
back here with the four.
Joey said "no".
Fucking guy, man.
At these prices, I can't
afford more phone surveillance.
I'm aware of that
and right now,
the plan is to go for a
hand-to-hand on one lieutenant
a couple rungs down
from Proposition Joe.
And then roll
the lieutenant up?
We don't think he'll
have much roll to him.
Joe's people are
pretty schooled.
The hope is that they promote
this mid-level dealer
who's a fool to replace him.
Name a Drac.
We're on his cellphone,
if he gets promoted,
maybe he talks to Joe
or Joe's top people.
We get that far, maybe
we start to see Stringer Bell.
What makes you think they'll
promote the wrong man?
We do it all the time.
Look, speaking of promotions,
I sent yours over to the hall.
As promised.
And?
The Mayor's holding it up.
My understanding is
he wants to know
what your wife is doing.
- My wife?
- Yeah.
There's a rumor
that she's going to
take a run at
a council seat,
maybe try to knock off
Eunetta Perkins.
That's my wife's business.
Yes, it is.
But the Mayor counts
Eunetta as an ally.
Our deal was
for a permanent unit
and the next vacancy
for major.
You got your unit and I sent
your name over to the hall.
I kept my word.
But the Mayor,
he may want to know
who his friends are
before he makes
a new commander.
Where'd she say
she was gonna be at?
Near the dugout, first-base side.
She'll turn up.
When she supposed
to bring 'em over to you?
Middle of the fourth.
Dad, can I have a hotdog?
Yeah, as soon as
the guy comes around.
Speaking of which,
where's the beer man?
There they are.
Oh, damn,
they got great seats.
Ah, hell.
What?
The guy on her left, the suit.
Just a friend.
Nah, he's in the cake.
Who goes to
an Orioles game in a suit,
spends half the time
on a his cellphone?
Downtown lawyer.
Someone wealthy like that.
<i>Wish we had more of it. </i>
Long way to go
for half a shot.
We'll do better
tomorrow, Bubs.
What kinda dope fiend
be talkin' about tomorrow?
Tomorrow ain't shit.
Today, Johnny.
Today I hunted down
all that metal,
lugged it around like a dog,
and nearly got kilt
over a scratch of metal
so that I had to
beg for my life.
Lost my trousers, man.
My fuckin' trousers.
And then I'm beggin'
again for half a shot.
Swear to god, man,
I'm not even high.
We just missed
a foul pop.
Yeah?
Our seats are great.
We're practically
on the field.
Yeah my friend, Dennis,
he gets company seats
every now and then.
Where are you sitting?
Mezzanine. Come on.
- Aw...
- No, no, you guys go.
Your dad hasn't
seen you all week.
Now, don't take
their jackets off
'cause Sean's just
getting over a cold. Okay?
Jimmy, right?
Dennis Kerpelman.
Great kids.
Anyway, nice meeting you.
You want anything
from the stand?
No, thank you.
Don't stay 'til the last inning
'cause it's a school night.
Bye.
You got spatter going in
two different directions,
just off the curb.
Yeah.
<i>Shooting on the West Side. <i>
Another one?
Christ, where?
North and Polanski,
Cole's up.
Cole's working
a cutting off Belvedere.
Call Crutchfield
and see if he's back
from the Westport scene.
<i>Crutchfield. </i>
If not, call Bunk at home.
<i>It's his off day. </i>
Fuck his off-day.
I love this town.
Maz's kinda quick
to yank a pitcher, ain't he?
I'm thinking
of becoming a woman.
Office.
Yeah.
I'm at the ball game.
The ball game.
Yeah, what about Cole?
Call him.
Ah, shit.
Alright.
Can you believe this?
They caught five tonight,
they're telling me I gotta
come in on my day off.
Five?
City's jumpin' bad, man.
Hey, listen,
- I gotta go to work, alright?
- Alright.
Mr. Jimmy's gonna...
He's gonna take you home.
You're on your own, partner.
Mee-maw.
And Ertman Avenue?
No ballistic information.
Are you sure?
Take your time, Major.
Can you believe
that cocksucker Carcetti?
Thinkin' I'm talkin'
out of school.
Any day now, Marvin.
What can a white
councilman give me
that a black mayor can't?
No, you played it right.
It was a 38 recorded
on Ertman Avenue, Sir.
So what you are
in effect saying, Major,
is rather than lookin'
at this cluster of robberies
you had along
Monument Street,
you chose to investigate
each using separate personnel.
No, Sir.
Three of those cases
were commercial robberies
so we sent those
downtown to C.I.D.
My people had responsibility.
Goddamnit, Marvin,
did you just invoke the word
responsibility to explain why
you didn't get on
top of this shit?
Did you just do that?
I don't think you know
what the word means
when I look at
the 24s and plainly see
that some 38 caliber asshole
is raping your entire district.
All the way from Greenmount
to fucking Edison Highway.
It's policing like that
makes it possible for us
to get hit with
five fucking homicides
in a single fucking
night people.
Poor fucking Marvin.
Better him than us, right?
Based on your testimony,
the buy itself will be
enough to charge.
But you get him saying
something on tape,
it's even better.
Are you sure this guy wants
to be selling you weight?
We don't want to be forcing this.
I been strokin' this guy
for two months, man.
That's not what
he asked you.
The guy is ripe
and ready, Kima.
It ain't no thing.
They're about ready.
You livin' out
of the office, Cedric?
Alright. Drac is depending
on you people.
Mount up.
Find your way home.
Look a little light to be
an ounce, don't you think?
Naw, man,
ain't nuthin' light.
It just settled is all.
Weight, man, if it
does what it should,
I'ma come back to you
for three, maybe four a week.
That could work.
We good then.
We good.
That's it.
Take 'em down.
- Somebody snitchin'.
- Shut the fuck up!
Let's go, Lavell.
This Cutty.
Told I could call for help.
What 'bout the oxbow?
The oxbow
on Laurens, at Fulton.
A- ight.
<i>I'm sayin', they caught 'em
with a whole ounce. </i>
<i>Might not be no bail
for that much weight. </i>
<i>They might just take it federal,
run wild on they ass. </i>
<i>And you know Joey's gotta give
Lavell's corner to someone right?</i>
<i>Might be my turn. </i>
Our boy won't shut up.
Caroline, you say it like
it's a bad thing.
Let's just hope we're listening
to a candidate for elevation.
I heard about you, man.
I hear your name
used to ring out.
You got somethin' for me?
You see where Shorty
sittin' right there,
you find a little help.
But when you ready, we got some
real work for ya, a-ight?
Jesus.
Hey, how you doing?
Okay.
We were just talking about you.
Really?
You know Denise
from the sorority.
Charles of course.
- Always a pleasure Lieutenant.
- Good to see you.
And I don't think you've
ever met Delegate Watkins.
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.
We were saying you fill out
a lieutenant's uniform nicely.
Makes an impression
on the campaign lit.
That matters?
Marla's a new face taking
on a longtime incumbent.
Everything matters, I'm afraid.
Well, anything
I can do to help.
I'll, um...
get out of the way
and leave you all to it.
Marla, I have to tell you
that your photo with Cedric
works really well
on the mailing.
<i>Yeah. </i>
<i>I sure hope he knows
what he's in for</i>
<i>because it's going to be
a long race for the both of you. </i>
<i>speaking of which,
you've got to make some... </i>
Jesus, who called the media?
<i>Naw, you think
the man might respect</i>
<i>my shit enough
to let me step up,</i>
<i>but it ain't
even go like that. </i>
<i>Why not?</i>
<i>He gonna give Lavell's corners
to that off-brand nigga Cheese. </i>
<i>An' you know what?
Joe my uncle an' shit. </i>
<i>I mean, I'm kin to
the fat motherfucker. </i>
That idiot worked for us he'd
be a deputy commissioner by now.
Ain't no luck
at all to this case.
And how in all good
conscience can I,
as chairman
of this subcommittee,
authorize anymore above-the-line
overtime.
When it's clear enough
from the data in front of me
that that money is not going
to go to line officers
or working detectives.
But is being to be paying
for drivers and clerical
and Jesus look at this.
So that two colonels
and three majors can attend
a community policing
seminar in Miami, Florida?
Mr. Chairman.
What does South Beach
have to teach this department
about making Baltimore
a safer place, Commissioner?
I have no idea
and you have no idea
and it is an embarrassment.
<i>Cedric?</i>
<i>They're gone. </i>
I want to thank you for this.
No problem.
It's not easy, I know.
But they seem
to think it matters
that I present myself as...
I'm fine with it.
All those years you were
all about my career,
Well, it's the least
I can do, right?
Goodnight.
<i>We're not holding
anything up in his district. </i>
<i>Repaving, foot patrols,
streetlights. </i>
<i>He's getting his share. </i>
<i>Unless, it's not
about his district. </i>
<i>It's about him. </i>
<i>Maybe he's got
big eyes for something. </i>
For what?
Not me, not my chair.
Not in this town.
Oh, no.
If the man came off any whiter,
he'd be see-through.
But, if that's it,
come on with it.
In fact, please Jesus.
<i>Or maybe John the Baptist. </i>
Soften you up
for someone else.
If he's gonna
bang us on crime.
Bang me on crime.
Look, is there any way
for you to talk to this guy?
Keep him from
crawling up my ass?
He's old first district.
Not a lot of favors we can call
in over that side of town.
So, we gotta show
him something, right?
Four to five percent
drop in felonies.
And murders.
Get the murders down
to under 250 for the year.
All due respect,
Mr. Mayor, we're at 232 now.
What can you
realistically do?
Best case scenario,
if we bump the overtime
is 275 maybe.
275, Christ.
That's a promise, right?
275 and this asshole
Carcetti has no issue.
Gentlemen,
the word from on high
is that felony rates
district by district
will decline by five percent
before the end of the year.
We are dealing in certainties.
You will reduce
the U.C.R. felonies
by five percent or more, or...
I've always wanted
to say this...
let no man come back alive.
In addition, we will hold this
year's murders to 275 or less.
Christ.
Feeling a little fazed,
Colonel Foerster?
A little dyspeptic?
Dis-who?
No, Sir.
I'm good to go.
He's a fun fact
for you people:
If Baltimore had
New York's population,
we'd be clocking 4000 murders
a year at this rate.
There is no excuse
I will except.
I don't care how you do it,
just fucking do it.
Deputy, as familiar
as we all are with the urban
crime environment,
I think we all understand
there's certain processes,
by which you can reduce
the number of overall felonies.
You can re-classify
an agg assault
or you can
unfound a robbery.
But, how do you
make a body disappear?
There is not
one of you in this room
who isn't here
by appointment.
If you want to continue
wearing those oak clusters,
you will shut up
and step up.
Any of you who can't bring
the numbers we need
will be replaced
by someone who can.
That is all.
Jesus, Bunny.
What got into you?
I got six months to my 30,
I'm out the door
on a major's pension.
The hell can they do to me?
<i>Spider bags, red tops. </i>
Any other bright ideas?
- How about a bug?
- A bug?
Yeah, bug one or two of the big
corners where these mopes hang.
Watchin' those corners
over on Ashland yesterday,
I'm seeing dumpsters,
weeds, maybe utility poles.
You hide a bug
on the right corner
at the right moment
you make this case.
We don't have the manpower.
Not to mention the money.
And for what?
We're still a long way
from a quality target.
I say we come down off the wire,
charge what we can and move on.
We come down early
two years ago
and we left a real bastard
on the street.
You're telling me
we're gonna let
that same sonofabitch
beat me again?
How many times
do you let a cocksucker
like Stringer Bell
go 'round the board?
Collect another
fuckin' 200 million.
There's other fish
in the barrel, McNulty.
Stringer's the target.
There isn't a better
motherfucker out there,
you know it, Lieutenant.
Don't you let him
go soft on this.
It's you against
the world, is it?
What the fuck did I do?
<i>Red tops! Spider bags!</i>
You up?
Step the fuck off,
motherfucker.
You got a need you
talk to one of the younguns.
I ain't in the market.
I'm sellin'.
You look like the right person
to be talkin' to, chief.
You seem like you steady
runnin' this shit here.
What, you some kind
of police or somethin'?
I'm a long motherfuckin'
way from the police.
I just finished
a 14 year bit in Jessup.
Got a package as
a comin' home present.
G- pack.
Why not sell that shit
your own self?
I just came home.
I ain't tryin' to get
my ass violated.
- Even split.
- Sheet.
It's all profit to you.
Risk mine, too.
What make you think
I ain't on paper or someshit?
60/40.
Cool.
Give your shit to my boy.
He good with it,
then come past tonight.
A'ight.
<i>And one last item
for you gents. </i>
It seems foxtrot was hovering
over the station house
a few days ago
and caught a lovely view
of about seven or 800 discarded
beer cans on the garage roof.
<i>Seriously, no off-duty
drinking on the station lot</i>
and if you do find
yourself holding a beer can
don't throw it on the roof,
take it home with you.
Come on, guys,
the memo came down
from our beloved Deputy
of Operations.
Alright, get outta here.
<i>Don't get captured. </i>
At ease.
Anything from day shift?
Nothing that'll make the papers.
Alright then.
I'm gonna ride the district
until the Deputy Major gets in.
If you need me, hit the radio.
Distribution?
Possession,
and some loitering.
Loitering?
And behaving like assles
in the presence
of sworn officers, boss.
5-0 creepin'!
Midnight relief comin' in.
The hell is all this?
You don't look at
what you did before,
you do the same shit
all over.
I'm outta here.
Where he at?
The fuck you lookin' at?
Huh?
What, you want a go?
Just my split.
Some bad luck there.
Poh-leece came through snatched
up a grod stash or two.
Shit happened to be yours.
Fuck, right?
You got a number?
A number?
Back in the day,
when a player tried to say
he lost a package
to the police,
he had to give up
a number for the report.
We ain't back in the day.
I'm gettin' fuckin'
tired of your ass.
Yeah, walk it off,
motherfucker.
Fuckin' old school ass bitch.
Got them spider bags.
Two get you three.
What?
You up?
Spider bags.
Two gets three.
You up or you not?
<i>Don't you know five-o?</i>

So, the old man,

What?
Shorty, I don't know you.
You know Miss Elaine

This her brother,
Earl from the V.A. Hospital.
He supposed to stay with her.
Can you help me inside?
I'm Chantal.
So, what's good?
Thank you, young man.
Oh shit.
Oh shit.
Nah, nah, nah...
Hey, yo, Omar.
Yo, all due respect,
but this right here,
this a Barksdale joint, man.
Do tell.
All Due Respect
You think this boy
woke up yesterday morning,
sat on the edge of his bed
and said:
"Today's my day to die?"
You don't think
this can happen to you?
Doc, hold that up.
Look at what that bullet
did to his heart.
That's his heart.
What was that,
scared straight?
More like bored stiff.
What's the deal with this?
I go down to M.C.I. Jessup hoping
to pull up a fella with some years on him,
see if he's ready
to share his feelings.
Turns out Barksdale D'Angelo
got himself rung up as a suicide.
D.O.D. of 72103.
Who worked it?
State police.
You want me to pull
the postmortem on this?
Yeah, he's kind of
our made guy down there.
I just want to make sure
that nobody did the suicide to him.
Ain't nuthin' but dust
an' bricks over there now.
Shit, all that battlin'
we did to take them towers.
You're tryin' to tell me we back
on the street with the rest of 'em.
Anyway, b, now that the towers is gone
everybody knows how it gotta go down.
I say we send our people
over there early.
Corner chiefs like:
"Yo, we here now,
"you know what I mean,
but we bringing something to the table. "
Lay it out like
it's their lucky day.
No flexin', no threats.
Just be like, this a good thing.
But you know
we gonna need good corners,
that's what we're gonna need.
Close to downtown.
Get the workaday trade.
- Come out like Freemont
- Fayette.
Yeah, like 40,
$50,000 a day, easy.
Yeah, I'm on it.
You know everyone
watchin' us on this, man.
They wanna see if we're gonna fuck this up
now that the towers are down.
You know what I'm sin'?
They measurin' us up.
They wanna see
if we're gonna be weak or real.
If a fool step to us, man,
we gonna do what we gotta do.
But it's them bodies
that got you in here.
If we can do this without the bodies,
we should.
You know what I mean?
Especially now
we light on muscle.
Speakin' of muscle, man,
you heard from that man I sent you?
Yeah, Cutty from the cut.
He rang, we took care of him.
Good, good.
How you fixed for the hearing?
It's all good, man.
Shit.
Levy got everything
straightened up tight for me, man.
I'll be home
before it get cold.
Towers came down.
So?
So, we're comin' in.
To my corners?
I don't think so.
Hold on now.
This is gonna be good for you too...
Yeah?
Now, how you figure that?
Yo, what you payin' now, 37, 38?
Yo, we can go 31, 32 shots.
Man, this shit's so John Blaze
you can step on it seven, eight times
and still take the cake...
Spider bags!
Spider bags!
Damn!
Yo, y'all seen Marlo?
Y'all ain't seen him?
Y'all know him?
Marlo?
Yeah, yeah, he was here.
Now he ain't.
<i>Get those spider bags,
spider bags!</i>
Jesus, Tommy, I like to shit
when I looked up and saw you
on the news, givin' it to Erv.
you fucker,
you're up to something.
I'm up to nothing,
I'm telling you.
I can help him,
he can help me.
A little itch here,
a little scratch there.
This is a win-win
for you, ain't it?
He won't play? You beat the shit
outta him because crime is up.
Press loves it and you score.
Flip-side is that if he caves,
you get yourself a snitch
in the Mayor's inner-circle.
So um...
what's my role
in your little drama?
I thought you might
broker a meeting.
You know,
help your fearless leader see the light
about his new friend on the council.
And I should tell him, what?
Make nice or invest heavily
in petroleum jelly?
Hey, his ass, his choice.
You didn't talk to him?
I couldn't find
the motherfucker.
Man, we just walk up,
we gonna bump.
There.
Middle of the block, right there.
Yo, where the whistle at?
Hold on.
Wait for Marlo.
<i>Yo, Cheese.
Where you been at, man?</i>
Nigger, that ain't
nothin' but bait.
Just soap your bitch.
Who my dawg?
You my dawg.
Who's my Dawg?
Who's my baby?
You make daddy some money, alright?
Yeah.
25 large on Dawg.
<i>Cheese!</i>
Yeah.
<i>Anybody I want?</i>
Anybody.
I want more than one.
I want the Olsen twins.
You got 'em.
Slaves.
All they live for
is to get you off.
But so now who
you gonna do for 'em?
One guy, one act, one time.
Right.
And the minute I name a guy
you're gonna be like,
"I knew you were a cocksucker
"from the first time
I laid eyes on you.
Steve McQueen, huh?
That's your fantasy?
You fuckin'
closet-case motherfucker.
Steve McQueen?
Fuck you, it's a set-up.
Both Olsen twins.
Ashley.
- Kate.
- Mary-Kate.
And yeah, I admire
their body of work.
They're yours.
All you gotta do
is name a guy.
I'm not catching,
I'm pitching.
No problem.
Cornermen out of the pit.
Release your dogs.
I got that!
Yeah! I got that!
Break your dogs!
Bait...
<i>Oh shit, there it is. </i>
<i>Can it just be like... </i>
<i>like this unbearable-looking woman?</i>
You know like that old tune
from "The Golden Girls"
the short one with
the coke-bottle glasses...
A guy.
<i>Hey, yo. </i>
Huh?
Let me ask you a question.
Where do you guys get those hats
with the bills over the ears like that?
I go into all the city stores
and the only ones I can find
are the ones with
the bills in the front.
Naw, it's the same.
Just turn it sideways on your head.
Thanks. Thank you.
That's a knucklehead from
the low-rises, right there.
Terrace's spreading out.
They got to go
somewhere, I guess.
Don't think you ought
needed to do that.
He turned cur on me, man...
Nah.
I think you got played.
So, I'm guessin' from the Terrace
being all cute about the property line.
<i>I just wanted to wait and see
what you wanted us to do about it. </i>
So, what you want us to do?
Get back to work.
Alright.
<i>Your boy really jammed me,
that little prick. </i>
<i>It was all over the news. </i>
You did not look particularly
commissioner-like.
Mayor told me the same thing.
You can't have that shit
every week,
not if you want His Honor
to give you the job permanent.
Tommy's a good kid, usually.
An asspain when
he wants something,
but mostly good people.
I don't give a shit
what he is.
Well, you can't have him
pounding on you, Erv.
Throw him a bone,
he'll take care of you.
Alright,
but I draw the line at going behind
the Mayor for this guy.
You can't sit where I'm sitting
and backdoor the fucking Mayor.
Sorry I'm late, guys.
My kid had a little league game.
It started late.
Well, I'll leave
you boys to it.
And what I have brought together,
let no man tear asunder.
- He win?
- Who?
Your kid, his team.
Oh shit, who keeps score?
Yeah, it's a little hectic,
but everybody steppin' off
at the right time.
These corner boys
we dealin' with?
I don't think they even
listen to their own people.
Yeah, I'm gonna
talk to peoples.
- Where you at?
- Marlo?
I can't find 'im.
And you told us not to start nothin',
so I set-up in the middle of the block.
You know, even that got hard stares.
I don't know.
It ain't gonna hold, I don't think.
This Marlo.
How hard you lookin' for him?
Like, why ain't you out there
looking for this motherfucker right now?
'Cause you called
this meeting here.
Shut the door.
What's your good news, man.
Omar right inside the stash.
Couple ounces of raw
already vialed, 600.
Cocksuckers even took
my watch.
Second stash this month
they did got to.
I mean, he, um,
he called you by name, String.
I mean, all due respect, but
do like unless you step to him.
It's gonna be like this.
Alright, man.
Double the muscle on every stash we got.
And if the man comin',
make ready for the man.
It's not personal.
I swear to God,
it's never personal with me.
Truth is,
I've been a councilman
for almost three years now.
And that's a long
fucking time to be ignored.
And this being Baltimore,
a whiteboy doesn't stand
much chance running citywide.
Maybe the legislature,
if the right seat opens up.
But until then, I'm stuck
in a job with no power
except getting
potholes filled.
All due respect, Councilman,
you're fucking with me because,
what, you're bored?
A little, yeah.
And what the fuck.
I mean, when it comes
to the crime thing,
this city can use all
the fucking help it can get.
If you're looking for dirt,
there isn't any.
There's always fucking dirt.
But right now, I'm just looking to know
how we could do better.
You give me that much.
I can try and get you
what you need privately.
No hearings, no press,
no grandstanding.
And if I don't play ball?
You're gonna have my ass
every time I'm in front
of your committee, right?
One thing comes to mind.
Shoot.
I can't get my marked units
back from Dickman Street to save my life.
Cars that are shopped for service
don't come back for weeks.
You tell the Mayor?
Not that you heard it from me.
Of course not.
- How much these?
- 10,000 a set.
Nigger show that on a ride,
he hangin' a sign on himself.
Lock my ass up.
No, shit.
So how you gonna play it?
If they from the Terrace,
that's Avon.
I know.
And Avon, he comin' home, too.
Well, if you inclined to work
something out, that's one thing.
If not?
Avon can seriously handle up.
I know.
So if you want to hold onto what's yours,
you best be ready.
You remember
that Barksdale kid?
The one who took
all the weight?
Tied his neck to a doorknob
in the prison library and sat his ass down.
I dunno.
Men of color usually don't do themselves.
I mean, take me,
for instance...
Yeah, I mean.
You got all the reason in the world...
And yet here I am,
still standing.
Give or take.
You looked at
the scene photos?
Nah, there ain't none.
State police dogged it.
My turn, Bunk.
Come on, come on.
Go with number three.
You gonna play
my song, darling?
Huh?
- You play the right song...
- Hey, Bunk.
I can make you hit
the high notes, baby.
Hey, Bunk.
Hey, look,
I saw her first, Jimmy...
Bunk, man,
what are you doing?
I got a place
right here in Canmden.
Be a gentleman, come on.
I'm bein' a gentleman, man.
I'm really
not interested, okay?
Come on, let's go.
You're all pink, baby.
I'm really sorry, he's had a bit
too much to drink, you know?
It's okay, thank you, thanks.
- You alright?
- Yeah.
You get yourself home?
Yeah.
Knock it out.
Naw, the baddest nigger
of all time?
Who?
This nigger from New York
from the olden days,
- Bumpy something...
- Bumpy?
Yo, he do shit like, run up
to a police station by himsself.
Nah.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Shit like that. Cops be like hidin', like,
"Yo, Bumpy, we sorry, man, we sorry.
Please go away, please, please!"
Woof.
And obtain gainful employment
and refrain from associating
with known criminals,
and keep this office
informed of your residence
and any change in that residence.
So I gather you're not working
at this particular time.
They still doin' the morning
shape-ups down at the market?
I don't know and I don't care.
Just get a job, any job.
- "Woof"?
- "Woof", like a dog.
Oh shit, it was like blaow!
It was Cheese's boy, Tri.
So you gonna
hit back or what?
You got a better shot
of the ligature?
Yeah, inside.
What he do,
hang himself twice?
He could have been leaning straight forward
until he blacked out then slid down
which would give you the vertical.
Or how about I come up
at him from behind...
and then set him down, make it
look like goodbye cruel world.
What do the scene shots show?
None taken.
The troopers really fucked
the pooch on this one.
All I have is some
half-assed report
reads like the investigator
went off his ritalin.
What's a large eckee...
No, large ecchymotic area,
or mid-back.
Bruising.
What, mid-back... as in...?
Or he banged himself a few
days earlier in the shower.
Yeah, maybe.
Nothing like a definite maybe.
<i>Tri finally got that m?</i>
<i>Done it on foot too. </i>
Caroline?
<i>Nigger lyin' in chalk but my boy Tri
got the dapple all up his sleeve. </i>
<i>Looks like polka dots. </i>
<i>But that's just something
you got to know from experience,</i>
<i>You know what I'm sayin'?</i>
<i>I even had to school him on the whistle,
still walkin' around with it. </i>
<i>"Yo Tri, stash that shit up at Neesey'S.
What's wrong with you?"</i>
<i>Aw, you know them niggers
is gonna get mad busy over this</i>
<i>so we gettin' busy too. </i>
<i>So what time
you comin' over?</i>
<i>Damn, bitch,
ain't you even listenin'?</i>
<i>You still there?</i>
Time-out!
Do that again.
- Do what again?
- Do that thing with your hand.
Do it in my face.
Fuck you talkin' about?
Got a lot of room in here.
Fuck the police!
Naw, man,
we was just hangin'.
Just slingin'.
How'd you work it out
with the corner crews,
all you guys from the Terrace
coming in like this?
I don't know
what you talkin' about.
Well, you best watch your ass.
'Cause the slingers out here?
They're like the
crack babies' babies.
Man, every year
everybody's like:
"Yeah, these kids out here,
they're a new breed. "
"I ain't never seen
nothing like this before. "
"This the end
of the world now. "
Look around, fuckhead.
This seem like the dawn
of a new day to you?
Can I go now?
Or you want to slap me up
some more first.
Get the fuck out of here.
How about a handjob?
Huh?
Aw, man, you don't even get
Weezy Jefferson for a handjob.
Come on.
Dozerman.
Wanna call it a day?
<i>They came back
on us this time. </i>
<i>Dazz an' them.
They got Peanut. </i>
<i>Oh, shit, is Peanut dead?</i>
<i>Naw, he's okay. </i>
<i>His brains all over
the sidewalk but he's okay. </i>
<i>What the hell
do you think?</i>
<i>Ah, shit, I gotta call Tony.
I'll get back Atchya. </i>
<i>Alright. </i>
Well, that's two
we heard about.
What the hell's going on?
Drug war maybe?
<i>S'up?</i>
<i>Nothing good, man. </i>
<i>I ain't sleep since
I capped his ass. </i>
<i>Close my eyes, see him layin'
there all bloody and shit. </i>
<i>Cheese, man,
you did what you had to do. </i>
<i>What I thought I had to do. </i>
That's Cheese?
<i>He was my Dawg, yo. </i>
<i>Had much love for me,
even then. </i>
<i>I ain't never gonna find
another Dawg like that... </i>
<i>well, they payin' for it now. </i>
<i>Mos' def. </i>
For months, these assholes
show perfect phone discipline.
Now, they're
talking up murders?
Cheese is only a level
below Proposition Joe.
All of a sudden,
this case has legs.
<i>Homicide... </i>
This is Freamon, major-case.
Who's the O.I.C. tonight?
<i>Hold on for Norris. </i>
<i>Yo, T., T., Man. <i>
<i>S'up?</i>
<i>I'm shot, I'm shot. </i>
<i>Aw shit, shit,
they comin' back. </i>
<i>Motherfucker!</i>
<i>Who this?</i>
<i>Damn. </i>
<i>Detective Norris. </i>
Ed, this is Lester.
<i>I hear you're catchin'
bodies on the east side. </i>
You "hear" it?
Like what, "probable cause," hear it?
Like, "I got something
concrete," hear it?
Or just,
"gas up my head," hear it?
<i>Like, "I got all the fucking time
in the world to jaw with you," hear it?</i>
How many bodies you got, Eddie?
"How many you got, Eddie?"
Asshole.
- You want me to go up to homicide?
- No, I got it, I got it.
You're the early man
on tomorrow, so go home.
See your kid.
I'm telling you, this kid
Berman's a fucking wizard.
I mean check it out, right?
Six reported auto thefts,
two of which state,
"not impossible car was borrowed"
making four auto thefts,
with two unfounded.
And the prizewinner?
Four armed robberies,
two of which complainants state,
"too dark to I.D. weapon,
not impossible
knife wasn't a com.. "
- He mighta groomed 'em to death.
- Yeah...
Wine into water.
There he is.
Abbadabba Berman.
The Doctor Atkins of crime.
Just doing what I'm told.
God, what a beautiful film.
I couldn't understand a word.
Oh, honey,
you gotta read the subtitles.
Oh shit.
Y'all go to the movies?
And you must be
the lovely Mrs. Herc.
How'd you like your movie?
Okay.
Herc and Carver here?
They try to snatch us up everyday like...
where the shit, who got the shit...
but they never get nothing.
So y'all go to the movies.
Damn.
Alright then. See ya tomorrow.
Is everything okay?
On two.
Pick up!
Pick up!
- Ed, you gotta help me.
- I can't, now now.
So.
So?
Everything good?
How's that fontanette?
Fontanelle.
Is it closing up?
Won't close for a while.
Good.
Good?
I'm just, I'm just sayin'.
Seis hombres, seis dolares.
Seis hombres...
<i>I ain't sleep since
I capped his ass. </i>
<i>Close my eyes an' see him layin'
there all bloody and shit?</i>
- Cheese.
- Cheese on a platter.
He never talks like that.
Now, why would...
because all good things
come to those who wait.
Does McNulty know?
I'll raise his ass.
We'll keep our ears to the wire
keep gathering String, no problem.
But if bodies keep falling
in the Eastern District,
we might have to give up
this wire tap.
Now you comin' around?
Been more than a dam year.
Looks just like his dad, huh?
Let me ask you.
When you heard Dee was
a suicide, what'd you think?
Hey, little fellow.
Come here.
Here's the thing: we got a tip.
And the autopsy report it backs us up.
Can you put him down please?
Sure.
You know,
I'm sorry about your loss.
He seemed like a pretty decent
guy, all things considered.
So when I found out about this,
I felt like I owed him...
the last thing I wanted to do was upset you
if there was no point to it, so...
if there's anything I can help with
or any questions you need answered...
or whatever.
Major, how many people
are under your command?
278, Sir.
278.
And how many felony arrests
they make last month?
Don't bother.
You made 16.
16.
In a month.
Same time period.
How many handguns you pick up?
All shifts, all sectors...
once again, don't bother.
The answer is none.
None.
You had four bodies last
night in how many hours?
Shut the fucking book,
how many hours?
Seven.
Try five.
Tell me about this kid.
- I believe his name is James...
- James Toney.
When's the last time
he was arrested?
With who?
Where's he sling?
How about this guy?
Or him? Or him?
You know what?
You got four bodies, all within
two blocks of each other
and you can't even start
to connect the fucking dots.
You got eight hours to get a grip
on this mess or you're done. You hear me?
Done.
Marlo?
You know I'm with Avon, right?
Stringer Bell?
Can we talk?
I need you to walk back up
there and pack up your people.
I'm being a gentleman
about it for the moment.
You offer up what you have on this,
you start the clock running on yourselves.
The wiretap has to surface in court.
No way around it.
She's right.
We finally got something
worth listening to
and you're talking
about giving up the wire?
Makes no sense.
There's a war going on.
We might have
four more bodies tonight.
This is Baltimore,
we might have six.
I watched Marvin Taylor
from the Eastern
get his asshole ripped today
because he has no fucking clue.
I don't believe this.
We got top lieutenants
talking about murders,
and we can't figure out just
to shut up and take notes?
We got bodies on the ground, Jimmy.
That's gotta matter for something.
Look, if we're at Cheese
then we're close to Prop Joe,
and if we're close to Joe,
then we're close to Stringer.
That has to matter.
Look, I was right there with you
when we left Stringer on the street
and it grinds me, too.
But the fact is, we didn't create
this unit just to lock up dope dealers.
There's a narcotics unit
downtown for that.
We're about violence.
Have been from the jump.
Barksdale was violent.
But right now, Stringer's quiet,
and over on the eastside, we got bodies.
Jimmy, we got enough from the tap
to take a real good shot at Cheese.
You put a murder case
or two together,
you may be able to roll someone up
at Proposition Joe or Stringer.
As far as bodies go,
four's a big number.
Okay then.
As of now, we use the phones
to work these murders.
Yo quiero mucho menos
pastillas de secoya en eso.
Y muy mas ancho un poco.
Si?
Gracias.
<i>Yo, we bracin' up, son. </i>
<i>Hanh?</i>
<i>Gather yo'self, nigga.
We gotta bead on Dazz. </i>
<i>Be at Neesey's crib
in a hour. </i>
<i>Dazz be with neesey?
I thought she was your girl. </i>
Neesey, huh?
Got it.
<i>We just hook up there,
then goin' to battle. </i>
<i>Bring your whistle,
in a hour, one. </i>
Mount up.
Caroline, call qrt with
that 20 and stay on the wire.
- We're on channel two.
- Alright.
Yo, Tri,
what size fries you want?
What?
Go!
Police! Freeze! Hands up!
<i>Put your hands up!</i>
Put your hands up!
Hands on your head!
Okay, Mary Tyler Moore.
Buck-naked.
Open the door, here I come,
drop my attache case down,
bend her over,
give it to her on the ottoman,
and she's like,
"Oh Rob, oh Rob... "
Who's Rob?
From the show. Done.
Mary-Kate and Ashley...
I don't want to say.
Just accept whatever pictures
are on my mind right now.
Anybody else?
Yeah, Dozerman's girl,
what's her name?
She's baking a cake.
Naked.
White flour splotches all
over her fine brown skin.
I come in, in a chef's hat,
nothing else on,
johnson out to here and say,
"that's no way to stir a batter.
Here, let me try to get... "
Hey, Doze,
what's up?
Done, now the guy.
This is a hard one for
anybody to understand.
I mean it's got
nothing to do with sex.
It's about... sympathy.
- It's about giving a guy a break.
- Yeah, okay, okay.
Gus Triandos.
Who's Gus Triandos?
A catcher with the Orioles
back in the day.
Me and my brother had his card,
sorry lookin' motherfucker, man.
I mean, he looked
like this little kid
who got left at a bus station
by his parents.
You know why?
Because he had to catch Hoyt
Wilhelm's knuckle ball.
Five fucking years,
the worst gig in baseball.
It was like trying to catch
a greased pig with wings.
He even told a reporter once
"Wilhelm nearly ruined me. "
Gus Triandos.
Big slow guy.
- Good choice.
- Go ahead, say it.
- I know you want to say it.
- Say what? There's nothing to say.
- Nothing?
- You put a lot of thought into it.
It's cool.
Okay.
Okay.
Tonight, three things.
Number one.
Keep your incident numbers sequential
or it's gonna be a stone mess tomorrow.
Number two.
We'll be photographing
evidence at the scene.
That means don't bag anything
until you get the shot off.
And number three,
don't embarrass yourselves...
make sure your camera's
loaded with film.
Okay, mount up.
So Cheese,
who's your Dawg?
You my Dawg.
I just wanna know
who's your Dawg, Dawg.
What's this some psychology, huh?
Yeah, okay, uh, "yo, please stop, stop.
I'll tell you everything I know. "
C'mon, Cheese.
Who's your Dawg?
Aw, hell no.
You ain't layin' no bodies on me, man.
Lawyer time.
"He was my Dawg, man. "
"I ain't sleep since
I capped his ass. "
"Lookin' up at me
all bloody and shit?"
"Had much love for me
even then. "
"I ain't never
gonna find another... "
Man, you all some
cold-ass motherfuckers, man.
We got you on tape.
So what happen, Cheese?
I thought he punked me, alright?
So I did what I had to do.
Which was...
Lit him up.
Well, he's talking anyway.
Well, what's done is done.
But, maybe we can
help you on this.
How?
You gonna bring him back?
No, on the consequences.
Help us help you.
- What?
- Maybe we can trade up.
Trade up for what, man?
For this?
- The fuck...
- Proposition Joe.
You give us Prop Joe and maybe
we look at this whole thing
with Dawg differently.
Now, why would I be talkin'
about Prop Joe behind...
You know what, man?
I don't even know no Prop Joe.
Okay, Dawg...
which one of these is he?
Where's that body?
Where I left it most likely.
- Warehouse on the east side.
- And he still there?
Far's I know.
'Less the SPCA come around.
What?
Looks like they broke him.
I got to say.
You really showed me something on this.
What can I possibly add to that
except I owe you one, Cedric.
You ever have one of those
have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too days?
I believe this could be my first.
Tell me something good.
We're charging him.
Improper disposal of an animal.
Discharging a firearm in city limits.
Animal cruelty, if you
wanna run wild with it.
Go ahead.
Call me a cocksucker.
- You know you wanna.
- Excuse me?
You know, I actually looked up
the stats on Gus Triandos.
Power hitter, right?
Fuck the both of you.
Later, dawg.
Kiss my ass.
Night, Bunk.
Funny day...
I'm the new departmental pet
for shutting down a drug war,
but I blew my wire
for a dead terrier.
You remember how you said you
hoped today would be your first
have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too day?
What about it?
Okay, gents.
You see the brake lights pump twice,
you know we got a clean hand-to-hand.
So I get in this morning and I'm
looking at three phone messages
from Buddy Ferraro over at D.P.W.
All assuring me that I'll have
20 radio cars back in service
at the end of the week.
Buddy and my old man go way back.
Made their first communion
together at St. Leo's.
So...
what else do you need?
You didn't go to
the Mayor with it?
Did you get your cars?
Did anyone get fucked over it?
Or did your job
just get a little easier?
I got 70 cops retiring
at the end of the year.
That I know of and no money for
an academy class.
The Mayor fucked you 'cause
I know that money was in the budget.
The Mayor delayed it
till next summer.
Less troops, less salary,
less bennies.
Even a six-month delay saves the city
two, three million.
Lemme talk to some people.
Yeah.
<i>Major Colvin?</i>
Yeah.
<i>I'm sorry to call you this late,</i>
<i>but we have an officer
down in your district. </i>
Which hospital?
I, ah, just got the lease, so...
Fucking solo cars!
I shoulda teamed him.
I fucked up.
Dead-ass motherfucker's dead.
We catch up to him,
he don't come in alive.
Right?
Nicked jugular, shattered jaw.
He'll live.
Hand me one of those.
I just got back
from shock-trauma.
You guys saved his ass getting
him down as fast as you did.
So what we got for a suspect?
Number one male, white t-shirt.
Baggy jeans, tennis shoes.
In the wind, but we're
locking it down out there.
So what's this
I hear about the gun?
Doze tried to return fire,
he dropped his piece.
Some fuck picks it up and books.
I mean I can't
believe this shit.
I'll take it.
No, no, no...
It'll be nicer when
I fix the place up.
Cedric...
I don't care.
No, tell him I'm cooked.
I just got done at
the hospital, I'm all in.
<i>Well, he was askin' if you could
maybe talk to the reporters. </i>
He doesn't want me talking
to reporters right now.
<i>Alright. </i>
That would truly be unwise.
<i>Alright, alright,
I'll tell him. </i>
Alright.
Bunny.
You look hellacious.
You got coffee going in there?
You know what I was thinking?
Tonight's a good night.
Why?
Because my shot cop didn't die.
And it hit me...
this is what makes
a good night on my watch:
Absence of a negative.
That was a good night.
Here's the thing.
Six months from now?
I'm gone.
I put in my 30
and the only thing that'll be left of me
on that job is an
eight-by-eleven framed picture
in the western hallway.
But you know what?
The shit out there,
the city,
is worse than
when I first came on.
So what does that say about me?
About my life...
Aw, c'mon, man.
You're talking about drugs.
That's a force of nature.
That's sweeping leaves on a windy day
whoever the hell you are.
You fought the good fight...
Not a call since
we gave it up to Cheese.
What did you expect?
<i>Attention. </i>
Be seated.
Regarding officer Dozerman,
His condition has been
upgraded to guarded.
'Till he can receive visits,
he's beemoved to the recovery unit.
As of this tour,
all hand-to-hand
undercover buys of C.D.S.
Are suspended
in the Western District.
Somewheres
back in the dawn of time
this district had
itself a civic dilemma
of epic proportions.
The city council
had just passed a law
that forbid alcoholic
consumption in public places.
On the streets
and on the corners.
But the corner is, and it was
and it always will be
the poor man's lounge.
It's where a man wants to be
on a hot summer's night.
It's cheaper than a bar,
catch a nice breeze,
watch the girls go by.
But the law's the law
and the western cops rollin' by,
what were they gonna do?
If they arrested every dude out there
for tipping back a high life
there'd be no other time
for any other kind of police work.
And if they looked
the other way?
They'd open themselves
to all kinds of flaunting,
all kinds of disrespect.
Now, this is before
my time when it happened but,
somewheres back
in the 50s or 60s,
there was a small moment of
goddamn genius by some
nameless smokehound
who comes out
the cut-rate one day
and on his way to the corner,
he slips that just-bought
pint of Elderberry
into a paper bag.
A great moment
of civic compromise.
That small wrinkled-ass paper bag
allowed the corner boys
to have their drink in peace
and gave us permission
to go and do police work.
The kind of police work
that's actually worth the effort,
that's worth actually
taking a bullet for.
Dozerman,
he got shot last night
trying to buy...
three vials.
Three!
There's never been a paper bag...
for drugs.
Until now.
If we ain't doing hand-to-hands,
then what the fuck?
And that shit with the bag?
What the fuck is that?

I gotta hit the head.
I can't take
this shit, Bunny.
Hey
It'll pass.
They're just
riding you now.
Next week it's somebody new.
Can't take away
your E.O.D., Marvin.
Worst they can do is bust
you back to lieutenant.
I don't even
wanna think about
the worst these
motherfuckers can do.
You don't either.
You're still not connecting
the dots, Marvin.
Have a look.
Hoffman and Holbrook, Sir.
Very good.
You had a body drop
there last week
and this is what the fuck
it looked like yesterday.
Bond and Preston
for the record.
Ashland and Wolfe.
Chase and Durham.
Sir, I deployed my resources
per your instructions.
We beefed up foot patrols.
We have our plainclothes
squads on 12-hour shifts.
And the corners stay full?
They move, Sir.
Everyday
they're gonna
sell their drugs somewhere.
Major Taylor.
I look at your numbers, I see
the intel reports, the photos.
It all tells me
that you lack a fucking clue.
If you'll permit me.
Is your Deputy Major present?
Yes, Sir.
You now command
the Eastern District.
Major Taylor,
you are relieved.
Take the podium.
Anyone else having trouble
with the writing on the wall?
Dismissed.
Dead Soldiers
And I'm like "nigger if you want
to sell me a new car
you better really sell it to me
'cause otherwise, I'm sittin'
back and I'm watchin'."
What you want
with a new ride for?
It ain't like you
can't get a new car
anywhere you want,
anytime, this whole city.
- I'm just sayin'.
- Sayin' what?
- In case.
- In case what?
In case I ever want
to buy a new car.
Damn, is that too
much to ask for?
Girl, you crazy.
Shit, shit,
Get down. Get down.
Yeah, they filling it now.
They protectin'
the fuck out of it, too.
You see what you wanted?
Yeah, man.
But they got the whole
second floor boarded up.
Got a little
porch 'round back.
Couple of the boys out there
now smoking on them menthols.
So we slide up from the back?
It barred up, too.
No way through the front?
Not now.
Come tomorrow morning
they gonna scale back down
to a three-man skeleton crew,
ya feel me?
Not sure I like this.
Why we gotta keep hitting up
the Barksdale people?
Ain't like this whole
motherfuckin' city
ain't got stashes all over it.
True that.
So why?
Because.
Because?
Indeed.
So that's a cop shooter?
Yeah, not much to him
but he did the job on
the Dozerman kid last week.
We gave it up
in a full statement.
Before or after you knocked
the shit out of him?
Injuries were sustained while
patrol officers were effecting
pursuit and rest
of aforementioned suspect.
He was caught
Eastside, right?
But the wagon made
a stop at the Western District
for an unscheduled tune-up.
It's dark on that backlot.
Western boys mistook
him for a pinata.
So what do you think?
I think this is a tragic motherfuckin'
miscarriage of justice.
I think it deserves
a special grand jury
and if not, the president
should appoint
an independent prosecutor.
Oh, no, no, no, actually
I think Kofi Bryant
an' the United fucking Nations
should get involved.
It's a murder, Bunk.
The word from upstairs is that
we supposed to be havin'
less murders, not more.
This is Anne Arundel county.
Why should they care about that?
Why should you?
Hey, Bunk.
Hey, how's it going?
Listen, um, Deputy
wants to know.
Have we recovered
Dozerman's service weapon?
No, Sir. The kid says he sold
it on the street.
Gave only the street
name of the buyer.
A certain Peanut,
whereabouts unknown.
They want that gun back.
Sir?
They don't want to have a departmental
weapon on the street.
You know, as a principle.
The great white
deputy has spoken.
This case is not down
until the gun comes home.
Fine, don't get up.
One of the most heavily armed
cities in the gun-loving world,
why should those
ignorant motherfuckers
care about one got-damn
semiauto, more or less?
What'd you bring me downtown
in this shit for, man?
Police don't get whif.
Talk to me, big man.
Thought you should know,
my boy Cheese,
he went into the box
with a couple of police.
He stood tall?
No doubt.
Kept his mouth shut
and waited 'em out.
Way it turned out,
they the ones that fucked up.
How come?
Police let it slip
Cheese played in some talkies.
Tried to pin a hit on him.
Said they had it all over.
Who got hit?
A dog.
What kinda dog?
Kind mistake
your leg for pussy.
So, they had phones tapped?
Don't matter to me
none if they did.
Me and the people I keep close,
we don't talk on the phone none.
You talk on the phone, String?
So we good then.
What we know is they
still looking hard at us.
You wanna know what kills more
police than bullets and liquor?
Boredom.
They jus' can't
handle that shit.
You keep it boring, String.
You keep it dead
fucking boring.
You're serious?
I am.
What's the closest
school to here?
Stuart Hill elementary.
That's at least eight blocks.
Three sevens.
Three sevens?
Five eights.
Bullshit, let's see it.
Five eights.
Read 'em an' weep.
You're cheating.
I just can't catch
your ass is all.
It's just luck, Tony.
It's just luck.
You called my desk
looking for me?
Yes, I did, come on in.
Grab a chair.
But watch your
wallet if you do.
Make it quick, Tommy.
The new city editor wants
a 40-inch weekender
on liquor board reform.
They're going to reform
the liquor board?
Yeah, with a hand grenade.
So what's on your mind?
We're off the record?
There's going to be
no academy class
of police cadets this year.
Mayor's orders.
Homicide rate's climbing,
felonies are up
we got patrol
vacancies out the ass.
Even more coming
at the year-end retirements.
And this is coming
from his honor?
To what end?
Keep some money.
Money's in the budget,
but even a six-month delay
in hiring saves
a couple million.
You think there's some paper,
something the Mayor signed?
Nah, but you call
the personnel office
and they'll confirm that
the class is delayed until next year.
You get that much
you can come back to me
for a couple of quotes.
You want in on this?
No indeed.
I love my mayor.
Councilman, thank you.
Stirring up some shit.
Just a little bit.
For the good of our
fair city by the bay.
Three twos.
Housing authority has this
slated for demolition, right?
But no money to do it yet.
Boss, you sure
it's a good idea
not to tell anyone
about this downtown?
Ignorance is bliss,
Lieutenant.
Anyone ever tell you that?
Once, but I beat the dog-piss
out of the guy with a nightstick.
Anybody seen McNulty?
Catch him up when he posts.
New target.
Kintel Williamson
goes by Prince K.
Has a string of corners from
Park Circle to Woodland Avenue.
And he's dropping bodies, too.
Three in the last four months
or so say our friends
in the Northwestern District.
So we're off
Proposition Joe's people?
We're going to ship the mid-level
arrests downtown to C.I.D.
Let narcotics work
up those prosecutions.
After that, we're
on to new business.
He don't look like much.
He's dropping bodies.
And with everybody pressed
to bring the murder rate down
that's the new mandate
for this unit.
Bell has bodies on him, too.
Not lately.
And Prop Joe hasn't
made much noise either.
They're still running product.
Still got kids
banging out there.
And now, 'cause we blew
a wire over a fucking dog
we have to let
them just walk on
go about their shit
like we were never anything
to take seriously
in the first place?
I want an investigative strategy
mapped out by week's end.
McNulty's here
in spirit anyway.
What?
Right there.
This will work, too.
There's a couple
occupied in the 200 block
and that one over there
but, otherwise...
we're good.
Good shit, right?
Let's go.
Commissioner Burrell, please.
<i>Who's calling, please?</i>
It's Councilman Carcetti.
<i>Hold please. </i>
<i>Hello. </i>
Erv, I'm givin'
you a heads up.
You're gonna get a call
from a Sun papers reporter
about the academy class.
<i>What the fuck, is this a joke?</i>
Calm the hell down, Erv.
You just no-comment the fucker.
<i>You tellin' me my name
will be no where near this</i>
<i>and then send a reporter my way. </i>
Exactly. Then you call
the mayor yourself
and you tell him you
got a reporter nosing around
about the academy
class getting pushed.
You tell him you
have no idea how it leaked.
<i>I know this shit's
coming back to me. </i>
Trust me you're
covered on this.
<i>Goddamn it. </i>
<i>You can't hang me out there
like this with the Mayor. </i>
<i>My ass is flapping
in the breeze. </i>
You want that class, Erv.
You gotta trust me.
<i>Shit!</i>
How you even find me?
Ran into Lukas.
Don't even call his nigger.
Nigger still owes me money.
He just told me
how to find you that's all.
He tell you how I'm doing?
I know what you thinking.
You ain't looking
all that yourself.
You look just fine, girl.
Just tryin' to find
your sister that's all.
She ain't for you no more.
She ain't for none of our kind.
Gone out county-way.
Picked herself up.
County clothes, county car.
County nose to look down
on all us city niggers with.
She a teacher.
Where at?
Don't be rushin' me,
motherfucker.
I know you lookin'
to tip on out of here
get your aftershave on
get yourself correct.
She teach speech.
Make it so every nigger
sound like Condo-Lisa.
Up by the B. Wells.
'Scuse me, Sir.
'Scuse me, have you
seen this little girl?
This my baby.
Can you just take
that picture with you?
Thank you so much, god bless.
'Scuse me, have you
seen this little girl
Lady, you gonna
have to back up.
She's my little girl.
Please, she's only four years old.
I ain't seen your little girl,
you're gonna have to back up.
- Please, just take a look at her!
- I ain't seen your...
How do?
Let's go.
Where it at, man?
Back there.
So, what up, man?
You don't value my time?
Nigga, please.
Hand me that screw gun
and calm the fuck down.
Go! Go!
Clear!
Tosha go!
Dante, go, I got your back!
Oh, I got you, baby.
I got you.
Go! Go!
Go! Go!
Yo, y'all ready.
Let's bang out.
Go, go, go!
Go!
Come on, Kimmy,
get in the car!
Get in the car, man.
Your department leaks
like a fucking sieve.
It could be someone
over here at the hall.
Someone on your staff.
Someone on the Council.
Well, it doesn't matter now.
We gotta spin it
the best way we can,
which means,
we need you to step up
and take this one
for the team, Erv.
Me?
Tell the newspaper
that the academy class
has been delayed
for some reason.
Lack of recruits
problems in your
personnel division.
Keep it in your shop.
After which,
the Mayor steps in
announces we'll have
an academy class
in january come hell
or high water.
Do it like that,
it's a one-day story.
Mr. Mayor, this was
a budget question.
I was directed
to delay that class.
And you took the hit then
and you're taking the hit now.
And I thank you
for both, Commissioner.
89.
And that's just the ones
with Westside addresses.
You gotta narrow
that shit down
find some way to work
with all them Peanuts.
Motherfucker, do I look like
George Washington Carver?
Cocksuckers got me chasing one
gun through a city full of 'em.
Homicide, yeah.
<i>Two down, Pall Mall
and Pimlico. </i>
Pall Mall
and Pimlico.
Got it.
Two down, in the street.
Ray Cole's up.
Cole's in court today.
And I caught that cutting
in Cherry Hill last night.
Don't look at me.
I'm in the haystacks, looking
for Dozerman's prodigal gun.
You gonna make me go
back-to-back as a primary?
That's some
cold shit, Bunk.
Agg assault with
a two-by-four?
I don't think so.
Put that with the part twos.
This one too.
Assault by pointing.
If you don't use a handgun
you don't get credit
for waving it, alright?
Larceny here.
Hump wrote this up
as a daytime b-and-e.
Fuck this.
Do it clean.
Don't massage anything.
Don't sex anything down.
We give 'em the fucking truth.
What about comstat, boss?
They'll rip you.
There's five months
to my 30, right?
Fuck 'em if they
can't take a joke.
The Major no doubt
has some explanation
some excuse if you will,
for a weekly felony
tabulation that's going
in the opposite direction
from the other eight districts.
I have none, Sir.
You are content with this?
No, Deputy, I'm unhappy.
I wish we were making
more of an impact.
But doing what we're doing
it's clear that's not the case.
Major Colvin
I am under the impression crime
is down in the Western.
Perhaps you misfigured
your felony stats this week.
No, Sir.
We were very accurate.
Sometimes the gods are...
uncooperative.
Uncooperative?
This is a cooperative effort,
a cooperative department.
Why in the Eastern District,
Lieutenant Daniels exemplified
this new spirit just the other day.
And because of that
we got two fresh
homicides in the black
and a lot less bodies on
the streets than could have been
had that drug war
been allowed to drag on.
Mayor has me taking the hit in public
for the late academy class.
You're kidding me?
Sacrifice for
the greater good.
Where's the fucking
loyalty, I ask you?
But in the Western, what do
I get from a veteran commander?
You're just having a laugh,
aren't you, Bunny?
You got the real stats
and projections somewhere else.
Someone's just outside
the door with them, right?
A stripper, maybe?
That would be nice.
She comes in,
flashes a little tit
gives us a whiff
of that muff
and delivers
my fucking stat sheets
with a reduction that matches
just what we promised the Mayor.
That would be beautiful.
That would be
creme fucking brulee.
But what I got instead
is some half-assed
"I-wish-we-were-doing-better"
platitude that's
meant to fool maybe
a six-year-old girl into
thinking you're doing your job.
well, she's left the room,
Major Colvin.
She's out there right now
asking the stripper
if she can have her job
when she grows up
because she sure as shit
doesn't want yours.
You know why?
Because there isn't gonna be
a goddamn Western District
in 20 years
if this shit keeps up.
I don't care how many years
you have on this job.
if the felony
rate doesn't fall
you most certainly will.
The gods are fucking you,
you find a way to fuck them back.
It's Baltimore, Gentlemen,
the gods will not save you.
She look like a player?
Bystander?
Right in the middle
of it all if she was.
Yo, my turn to be Omar.
No.
Gimme, please, gimme.
Look, I'm tellin'
you, I was there.
Whitefolks was on the stoop
by the nine-oh-nine club,
an' Apex just
standin' over his ass
pumpin' more holes in the boy
than a motherfucker need.
Shit, I ain't lyin',
Soon as that motherfuckin'
nine stops talkin'
whitefolks looks up
at Apex, says:
"Bitch, that
the best you got"?
Man, I'm jus' sayin'
a boy got that much white blood,
he got to be a punk.
You want me, boss?
Your numbers way down, Fruit.
Way down.
It's Barksdale's people.
They clippin' the dope
fiends comin' up Freemont.
You know, when I ran a shop
an' my numbers dropped
I damn sure did
something 'bout it.
- Yeah, I hear that.
- I just want 'em moved.
Take the younguns with you
give 'em a workout.
Alright.
So, Lieutenant
you got an attaboy
from the deputy today, huh.
Cost me my wire tap though.
Still, it's good work
over in the Eastern.
Knocking down a drug war.
Yeah, he's gonna do the same
thing for me up on Park Heights.
I got this Kintel Williamson
character who needs some fixing
and Rawls promised
me Daniels and his unit
for about a month or so.
You're getting quite
the rep there, kiddo?
So Stan, what's your plan
for the Southeast?
How're you gonna
give Rawls his numbers?
I don't know.
Flex squads on the corners
foot patrols
in the Perkins Homes
overtime out the ass.
And if that don't work,
cheat on the stats.
What say you?
Shit, me?
I'm gonna go to 12-hour
shifts on the weekends.
What about you, Bunny?
I dunno.
I thought I might
legalize drugs.
So they hit
the got-damn alley?
And we on 'em.
That cocksmokin' motherfucker
with the big-bitch gun?
He was runnin' hard
on his ass, but...
I think I hit him.
Nigger, you ain't hit nobody.
I mighta hit him.
Yo, String,
we hit the one girl.
But after that, man, I ain't
see nobody catch no lead, man.
'Cept for Tank.
Yeah, Tank gone.
The other broad dropped him.
So I guess we even now.
So you get one, right?
Yeah.
That's good.
That's like a 40-degree day?
Ain't nobody got nothing
to say about a 40-degree day.
50, bring a smile
to your face.
60?
Shit, niggers is down there
barbecuing on that motherfucker.
Go down to 20, niggers
get their bitch on.
Get their blood complainin'.
But 40?
Nobody give a fuck about 40.
Nobody remember 40
and y'all niggers
is giving me way too
many 40-degree days!?
What the fuck!?
Now, we're gonna cover
that bitch's funeral
her fucking wake.
We're gonna be
all over that motherfucker
till the bitch
hit the ground.
And if the faggot roll up
to pay his respects
we're gonna be
on that motherfucker...
yo, who the fuck you
talking to, man?
It's Donette, String.
She been callin'.
No.
Put the phone down.
Y'all feel me on this?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
He show up
we on him
like a motherfucker...
like a 40-degree day.
So, overall
felonies are down
but murders are still up.
What's our next move?
Let me bump overtime
and court pay for homicide
and district ops.
Cases go into the green
before they go into the black.
Done.
And, of course, if we could get
some help at the courthouse
it would go a long way.
If you're going to try
and dig your way out this
don't make me your shovel.
My department is bringing you
casework that goes nowhere.
The cases are thin.
Most wouldn't make it past
a prelim in the court
of a freshman judge.
Well, maybe if your personnel
weren't so got-damned concerned
for their got-damned
conviction rate
they'd chance
a whodunit or two.
Oh, for chrissake!
Jesus, at least pretend
you're on the same side.
Stephen, you and I are both
going to be counting votes
this time next year.
Do something to help
our sorry asses.
And Erv, if you want
to do more than just
finish out walker's term
show me something more
than a pass of the buck.
I don't think any of us
wants to have to get a real job.
Mr. Mayor.
Alright.
I'll see you both
in here on this next week.
Thank you, Sir.
Like children.
Demper's always
been a hack.
But he's an elected hack,
so we're stuck with him.
But burrell, though?
You're vulnerable
on crime, Clarence.
You need to set some
deadwood adrift.
Burrell's got friends.
The ministers?
He might be their man,
but so are you.
You fire Burrell, you get
some new blood in there
the crime rate drops, huh?
The ministers
will live with it.
So you're tough
on deadwood, huh?
In the new 11th
district too, I hear.
Mr. Mayor
it's time for Eunetta to go.
She's had her time
there are better people
out there for the council.
She's on the team, Odell.
just like my police
commissioner.
I value loyalty.
Don't you?
Bunky Bunk.
Where's my Bunk?
Cole's up, not you.
You're on Dozerman's
gun, remember?
Cole's at the courthouse.
Sue me.
Rawls and Foerster
have crawled up into my backside
and they're gonna stay there
until you find Dozerman's gun.
Now, I would like it
very much if I could
unclench my ample asscheeks
if you don't mind
and rid myself
of that discomfort.
Jay, I just caught one
that pushed it's way
all the way to
the top of my stack.
A victim, Jay.
- On the real side.
- Do tell.
Second body in a double.
Girl in her 20s, caught
in the middle of a firefight
takes one in the dome.
But, she's still dead in a zip code
that does not fucking matter
and you still owe me
a departmental-issue nine.
Find the fucking gun, Bunk.
Fuck me.
Kintel Williamson,
who the fuck?
He has corners
in Park Heights.
But Jesus, who doesn't?
So all day we're
calling you, Jimmy
wonderin' where you were at.
Kima, maybe you
can enlighten us.
Don't look at me.
My runnin' buddy don't even tell
me where he's off to these days.
I was at the library.
Bullshit.
The library at M.C.I. Jessup.
D'angelo barksdale
was not a suicide.
The M.E. tell you that?
He didn't need to.
The physical evidence
didn't match up.
Look, I don't like
coming up off Stringer
and Prop Joe
anymore than you do
but McNulty,
this shit is kinda weak.
Cedric is under
a lot of pressure
to use this unit to get
the murder rate down.
So, for now
Stringer Bell's jacket
belongs in narcotics.
Man took you
off a boat, Jimmy.
He want to peel his unit off,
his unit, Jimmy.
And go after the target of his
choice, maybe it's his call.
Lester, I thought you were
all about the best case possible.
When it's there, I am.
Yo, I need y'all
to hear this, man.
It was my fault.
Ya hear me?
I'm sorry, yo.
That don't do nothin' for me.
How come...
they know you're police
when they hook up with you.
And they know you're
police when they move in.
And they know you're police
when they decide
to start a family with you.
And all that shit is just fine
until one day it ain't.
One day, it's:
"you should have
a regular job. "
"You need to be
home at 5:00".
"You need to call more. "
I'm sayin'.
"You need to stop
fucking waitresses. "
I wanna come down
here tomorrow to Western.
See what's what since
those towers came down.
We're supposed to start
on Kintel tomorrow.
Oh, fuck that chump.
He can wait day or two.
Yeah, okay.
What the fuck.
When you were humpin'
a radio car in the Western?
Was this your hole?
Yeah.
Here and down on Winchester.
Under the bridge.
Bet there were a lot
of nights you didn't
go home to the missus.
Don't tell me
I'm the same kinda asshole.
Pucker up, girlfriend.
Jesus.
I'm turning into McNulty.
Hey, I'm going out.
Nah, grandma,
you know I can't.
Times like these,
honey, you have to shine.
In your face, in your clothes
and in your pocket.
Now, go on.
Make sure you get
something to eat, hear?
Go on, now.
You know 'em?
sNot a clue.
Crew on that corner
looks familiar.
A couple old faces.
Not many.
You go away for a year
and the whole world changes up.
Quiet though.
Barksdale loses the towers
and he's able to stretch out
without bodies falling?
I wonder what the Western
guys have been seeing lately.
Hey, Jay.
What the fuck happened?
When?
How is he?
Aw, shit.
You'll let me know, right?
Okay, yeah.
Thanks.
You know Ray Cole?
Homicide, right?
Collapsed in the gym at the
central district this morning.
On a fucking
stairmaster.
Well, how is he?
A stairmaster.
Hey, Puddin', check it out.
Where they at?
I don't know.
Look out, man.
Break it, motherfuckers.
Man said break, come on.
I was workin' on that bitch.
Yeah, Shorty, you hard.
We outta here.
The Commissioner
acknowledged that money
had been budgeted
for the academy class
but said the department
was awaiting approval
of a federal training
and education grant
before scheduling the program.
Burrell can talk
some shit, can't he?
Downtown in the house.
Hey, Kima, baby.
Hey, Ellis.
Herc.
So, what do we
owe the pleasure?
Cruisin' your district, seeing
what's up since the towers fell.
We see Barksdale crews
on a few corners
but no one seems
to be beefin' with 'em.
What's up with
all this brotherhood?
We keep the lid on tight.
You know, they know
we are not their friends
and they damn well know
we'll take it to 'em
if they don't behave.
What do your C.I.'s tell you?
Fuck C.I.'s.
We don't need
no stinkin' C.I.'s.
We tune 'em up, we beat 'em
down, we lock 'em up.
It's the Western District way.
Sergeant
you're wanted in roll call
for a supervisor's meeting.
Gotta go.
Remember, what I told you?
A police is only
as good as his informants?
Well, we ain't downtown
no more, Kima.
We're in the trenches here.
You want information,
you go get your own C.I.
And shoot the shit.
You're late, Sergeant.
I had a couple downtown
detectives in my shop.
They were confused
and required assistance, Sir.
Well, I'll catch you up.
The new strategic plan
for the district
is to move all
street-level trafficking
to these three areas.
We want to push it.
Push it, boss?
If they don't go easy,
then they go hard.
But...
we let these knuckleheads know
that if they
move to these areas...
away from
the residential streets
away from commercial areas,
away from schools...
if they take their
shit down the road
they go about their business
without any interference from us.
It's going to be hands-off
in the Western District
for the foreseeable future.
Bullshit, man,
no fuckin' way.
Wait, wait.
You're saying you want us
to give them a free pass?
How we going to look
them in the eye?
They'll shit all over us.
Tell their kids
to shit all over us.
Hey, the Major
wasn't finished.
You gotta take
the long view here.
Once
once they're all comfortable
once they're all rounded up
once they've been
down there a bit
and they're used to
putting their feet up
and playing wit the remote
then we move.
Then we go back
and we do police work.
Look at it this way, Gentlemen
would you rather
shoot a fish in the ocean?
Or would you rather
gather 'em up
in a few small barrels
and start emptying
your clips then?
Not to mention, you still get to kick
the shit out of all the mopes
who don't move off our corners.
So, it ain't all bad.
Slow up, girl.
Come on now.
So, this your ride?
It's nice.
Suppose you got a Lex.
Nah, girl.
Got a bus pass.
You out the game, then.
Doing a little
landscaping right now.
But tryin' to figure
things out.
So, what's your boy's name?
Allen.
After Iverson?
After his daddy.
What?
Trying to picture
you mowing a land.
I don't be wearin' the suit.
You look good in it still.
You look good too.
You know they bought
a lot a folks out
with early retirement
in parks and rec.
I could maybe hook you up
with someone to talk to.
A man at my church
is helping the city
fill a lot of those jobs.
That would be...
thank you.
Write your
number there.
He'll call you.
I gotta go.
It was good seeing you.
Grace.
Looking at you.
What?
Hurts.
Shouldn't look then.
Food blast'll
take yer mind off it.
Rather my mind on it, Bubs?
Swear I'm sick
of all this, man.
Wonderin' when
I got so old.
How 'bout some more
mac n' cheese, huh?
Hey, Bubs.
Kima.
Hey, Bub.
McNutty, man, my mainest man.
You ready to put
some work in?
Born ready.
Snitchin'?
Fuck that, Bubs.
Hey, hey, nah, man.
Better than liftin'
500 pound radiators.
I'm up for these two, Johnny.
It's easy money, man.
C'mon
let's grab a burger.
Mind if I bang
outta here early?
I ain't right
with this Cole thing.
Gonna be a detectives'
wake at Kavanagh's tonight.
You gonna come?
Barely knew the guy.
You all layin' him
out at the bar, huh?
Tradition.
Tomorrow night, he goes
the funeral home for family.
Tonight, Ray drinks
with the boys.
C'mon, Bubs,
we ain't got all day.
And he's up for re-election
and he's never had a single one
of his goo-goo bills
pass the committee.
So, he's got one for
all-day kindergarten
I mean who's gonna argue
with more kindergarten?
I mean, this guy
has got a bill which is
the legislative equivalent
of kissing a baby.
So, right, he goes
to his chairman
pleads his case and says:
"You know, this don't
go through, I'm torched. "
"I'm going to be back
in that hardware store, mixing paint. "
So, the chairman
takes pity and agrees
gets the bill to the floor.
But the house speaker?
He hates this bill.
So, it gets loved
to death, you know...
slap on an amendment
for another 150 mil in costs
subsidies, handouts and
the bill goes down in flames.
122 to 10.
The delegate, he can
smell those paint cans.
And the chairman says:
"Hey, sorry brother,
I fought like a tiger for that bill. "
Who wants friends like that?
You want friends
in this racket, get a dog.
What?
I need to talk to him.
Look, just tell
him it's Donette.
Yeah, he know
who the fuck I am.
- YoSstring, she say...
- Not now.
Look, he say not now,
I gotta go.
Marlo.
It's a problem, String.
Club soda and lime.
You'll never
get there that way.
Get where?
Excuse me.
How the hell was I to know
the Mayor was gonna
put the screws to you?
You read the paper?
I look like shit.
Hey, you got your class
and probably scored points
with Royce out
of sheer loyalty, right?
We are police
so no lies between us.
He wasn't
the greatest detective
and he wasn't the worst.
He put down some good cases
and he dogged a few bad ones.
But, the motherfucker
had his moments.
Yes, he fucking did.
You remember
the Mississippi extradition
the Arson murders?
He brought that case home.
And the triple
at the after-hours
over on Hudson Street?
That was Ray Cole at his best.
And Fayette Street...
in '93, the drug wars.
He took a lot of hot
corners and cooled 'em.
Yes, indeed.
He won as much as he lost
much as any of us.
For chrissakes, Hugh, play
the fucking song already.
Did he piss off
a wife or three?
No fucking doubt.
I think the last one
actually kinda got used
to him, thank God.
Did he say the wrong
shit now and then?
Did he bust balls
and cheat on his taxes
and forget to call his mother
and fuck the wrong broad
for the wrong fucking
reason every now and then?
Who fucking doesn't, Christ?
Was he as full of shit
as every other sadsack
motherfucker wearing
a badge of Baltimore City Police?
Abso-fucking-lutely.
His shit was as weak
as ours, no question.
But Ray Cole stood with us,
all of us
in Baltimore
working
sharing a dark corner
of the american experiment.
He was called.
He served.
He is counted.
Old king Cole.
Old king Cole!
I'm sorry, but I gotta
get these guys home.
But all things considered,
I think they did pretty well.
They were great.
And you were great,
really, Jen.
Besides, I think they got
all the family shots they need.
So, you'll be awhile,
though, huh?
Gotta work the crowd,
you know?
Make 'em think
I'm worthy of their faith.
You are.
- Well, thank you...
- Most of the time.
Bitch.
Not too late if you
can help it, okay?
Shit is fucked.
You fucking wake up,
like any other day.
You fucking eat
and think about bills
and dry cleaning and shit
and fucking vacation
and your fucking
retirement plan and what?
Like that.
Like that.
He checked out of here
with you still owing him
a clearance on that Omar thing.
Oh, I know, I know.
I fucking know.
Like that.
On a fucking stairmaster.
On a fucking stairmaster.
Wake up an' die
right, you cunts.
What's goin' on, man?
That whip is pretty, yo.
I gotta get me one
of them joints someday.
Shit. Yeah.

...and not only do we hear
and appreciate your input
but we are fully committed
to giving 110% in our efforts
to fight this war against drugs
and take back your streets.
But we can't do it alone.
So when you see illegal activity
we need you to pick up the phone
and call it in so that...
Man, that's bullshit.
Please hold all your questions...
I near wore out my phone
dialin' 6-8-5-drug
and for what?
Those boys were back on the
corner the next damn day.
The fact remains the police
department can't do it alone.
We need your cooperation.
My cousin Willy Gant cooperated.
He went downtown and testified.
He deader than Tupac today.
Look, I know the problem
seems insurmountable.
But we are making progress.
Take a look at this chart.
This line here represents...
I have the microphone, ma'am.
Let the woman speak.
My kids, they can't
play outside no more.
Some nights,
when we hear these pops
we got to sleep under our beds.
I come home from work
I can't even get up my front steps
'cause they occupied
by the drug dealers.
Is that in that picture
you got up there?
I'm Major Colvin.
I apologize for giving you
the wrong impression tonight.
We mean no disr'espect.
I know what's going on
in your neighborhoods.
I see it every day.
Ma'am, it pains me that you
cannot enter your own front door
in safety
and with dignity.
The truth is, I can't promise
you it's gonna get any better.
We can't lock up the thousands
out there on the corners.
There'd be no place
to put them even if we could.
We show you charts and statistics
like they mean something.
But you going back
to your homes tonight
we gonna be in our patrol cars
and them boys still gonna
be out there on the corners
deep in the game.
This is the world we've got, people
and it's about time
all of us had the good sense
to at least admit that much.
So, what's the answer?
I'm not sure.
But whatever it is
it can't be a lie.
It's all yours, Sergeant.
As I was pointing out...
Who gave him a can of gasoline
and told him to put out the fire?
<i>... Are making progress. </i>
Tommy Carcetti.
Marla Daniels.
I'm gonna...
gonna take a run
at Eunetta Perkins.
I know who you are.
I've seen you with Delegate
Watkins a couple times already.
Well, Councilman, this is
not your home district.
What brings you
to the Westside?
I got the public safety
subcommittee, so...
here I am.
Anyway, good luck with Eunetta.
And welcome, Ms. Daniels,
to the noble calling of public service.
<i>... further west
in your neighborhoods. </i>
<i>The numbers of crimes against
merchants are way, way down. </i>
<i>We believe we're
making significant... </i>
What the hell was that?
Tired of the bullshit.
Tired make you lose your mind?
Amsterdam
So what you need from Bubs,
I mean exactly?
Lay of the land.
Who has what corners,
now that the towers are down.
We wanna know what happened to
the Barksdale people especially.
And this pay how much?
Let's treat it like a real job?
Say five an hour, 30 on a day max.
That's less than minimum wage.
That's no withholding, Bubs.
It's tax-free.
Alright. It feels good to be
out here, you know?
Gainfully employed.
- Thought your boy was coming, too.
- Johnny?
He don't think much of
this here with y'all.
'Sides, he happen to be one
of the laziest white boys
to ever shit between two shoes.
- Me, I been workin' since I was a kid.
- Yeah?
What's your resume
read like, Bubs?
Just curious.
Well, I ain't claimin'
no payroll jobs, Kima.
It's been a while since
I punched a clock.
When was that?
Long time ago
before I had a sheet.
Shoot, I was...
I was still clean.
I got one of those
stock boy jobs
for one of those
"cheapest guy in town" stores.
Unloading appliances
taking air conditioners and shit
out to the customers' cars like that.
How many you want?
What happened?
I put a clock radio
in the trash can one day
tryin' to be cute,
and got caught.
I ain't even need a clock radio.
See, that's me.
Born fuck up.
A- ight, you know what?
Five dollars an' hour.
30 on the day. That'll work.
And this here is your
get-out-of-jail-free-card.
On this card is my
full name and phone number.
A police officer was
shot in this neighborhood
a couple of weeks ago.
Y'all know the incident
I'm speaking of, right?
I'm lookin' for the officer's gun
a glock nine
which happened to misplace
itself during this incident.
Now, I don't care...
I don't care who has it now
I just need it
to find its way home.
Y'all don't happen to know a fella
by the name of Peanut, right?
I didn't think so.
Anyway, gentleman,
you know, one hand washes the other.
You give me a good word
on that gun
and I can make almost
any charge disappear...
Any questions?
Get 'em out.
Shit, I had to try somethin'.
<i>One each. Keep it movin'.</i>
<i>Little boys, yellow tops all day long.
Right here. </i>
Alright, alright.
You see him to get that
knock out shit, a-ight.
Good luck to ya.
Yo, he down across Freemont?
Yeah, that way on this side.
Oh and Barksdale is down the way.
<i>Got the red tops, red tops!</i>
<i>Spider bags. </i>
<i>Come get the red tops,
red tops!</i>
<i>Major Crimes Unit. </i>
<i>He's not in right now. </i>
<i>Alright. </i>
To what do we owe the honor?
Just checking in.
Why, you got somethin' goin' on?
Nothing too sexy.
Just pushing a case up a hill,
inch by inch on Kintel Williamson...
our stated target.
We're workin' too, Lester.
Yeah, on your own thing.
You even listening to me, McNulty?
I got a real case to bring in.
Fella name of Stringer Bell.
You mighta heard of him.
You got a mouth on you, boy.
He's still out there, Lester.
He's got his corners, his money...
fuck it, by now, for all you know
he's got all that
downtown real estate.
Motherfucker probably
owns half of Baltimore
without us even knowing it.
That ain't the point...
Do you even know what happened
to all that real estate, Lester?
All that downtown property
Bell had title on?
Fuck no.
He's probably laughing
his balls off right now
at you, me, Daniels, all of us.
You even pretending to speak
for anyone other than yourself, McNulty?
I'm speaking for the job.
You wanna talk about police work?
I was doing the job when
you were just dreamin' on it.
Daniels was out there, too.
Now, you gonna fuck him when he
pulled you off a got-damn boat?
He's a boss, fuck the bosses.
Maybe Daniels plays
a few games to get by
but he's cost himself plenty
for the sake of the job!
He's earned some loyalty.
Fuck loyalty and fuck you, Lester.
I never thought I'd hear
chain-of-command horseshit
come outta your mouth.
Motherfucker, I've spent a lot
of time in a lot of weak units.
More than you.
Now, this here?
May not be perfect
- but it's a chance to be police.
- Well, then be one.
You're not even worth the skin
off my knuckles, junior.
Jimmy, don't...
You put fire to everything
you touch, McNulty
then you walk away while it burns.
I got nothin' more to say to you.
Nothin'.
And you.
I'm surprised at you, girl.
Daniels raised you from a pup.
Gotta get with Bubs.
Check on those fucking properties.
Well, Major Colvin,
what do you think?
It all sounds good.
But before I give you a final answer,
I need to speak with my wife.
I'm not talking about the position.
Your cheesecake.
The cheesecake's fine.
They bring it in from Michael's,
out on York Road.
It's got a little
cinnamon in the crust.
None better.
Course, I like to think our
offer's pretty damn good, too.
Excuse me while I go to the
little boy's room, gentlemen.
I need to tinkle.
Tinkle?
I never understood why
a grown-ass man gotta talk like that.
He need to take a piss,
whether he know it or not.
You'll get used to these
academic types, Bunny.
'Specially when you get
that first paycheck.
I mean, 80k is
nothin' to sneeze at
for a number two security job.
Full bennies
on top of your pension.
Yeah, it is generous.
And dull...
in a good way.
I mean...
the worst you'll
ever see is a rape.
A date rape, maybe.
You're ready to take it
down a notch, aren't you?
Hell yes.
Yeah, that's how I felt.
My only regret was that
I didn't tell the deputy ops
to stick it in his ass
on my way out the fucking door.
Johns Hopkins wants you, Bunny.
And they wanna pay
Johns Hopkins money.
But what?
You gotta ask your wife?
Oh man, I ain't gotta
ask her nothin'.
I'm just...
letting Mr. Jenkins
stew a little, is all.
Wonder what's keeping him.
All he had to do was tinkle.
I guess he felt the need
to make a dookie, too.
They got corners up on Argyle
and along Freemont up top.
Avenue corners belong to everybody.
Some who was with Barksdale,
some independent-like.
McHenry Street got some
of Barksdale's people too
but gangster Webster's crews
is right beside 'em.
What about the Lower Avenue
corners and the Poe Homes?
They belong to a young
boy name Marlo.
Go by the name a Black.
Marlo?
Young boy.
Got all that good real
estate near downtown?
Got hisself the lunchtime trade.
If Bell and Barksdale
were gonna hold anything
they'd hold onto the Homes
and Avenue corners.
Is Marlo one of
Barksdale's people?
Marlo what?
C'mon, you got anything
else on this guy?
You got another tip, maybe?
So much for the hourly wage.
1-0-7-m-7-0-3.
Yeah.
That's the tag on the truck he ride.
1-0-7-m-7-0-3.
Did you prime it?
That little rubber ball right
there, next to the spark plug.
You gotta push it in three times
before you try to start it.
Gets the gas goin' to the carb.
You want the truth, I ain't
never used one of these.
Never had no call to.
Yeah, well, I didn't pick you up
for your landscaping skills.
All these Spanish?
They on paper, too.
I only use people like y'all.
Sometimes it comes back on me,
sometimes it works out fine.
How long you been uptown?
10 years.
Hotter than a motherfucker out here.
Yeah, it's hot.
Every day.
You gonna be ridin'
in the back of that hard truck
bouncin' around
every day.
And your back's gonna
be yellin' at you, every day.
I used to drive an SL.
Pretty gold convertible, nice rims.
I don't even think
on that car no more.
You put it behind you, huh?
Some can't.
I'm just sayin':
You wanna stay on the straight
ain't gonna be no big reward to it.
This is it right here.
Prime that bitch three times.
She'll start right up.
Miss Pearlman.
Cedric.
How goes Kintel Williamson?
- Anything there for me yet?
- No, not yet.
We'll get there.
Is that all you
came by to tell me?
Just keeping the lines
of dialogue open.
So, what's on your plate?
Oh, there's plenty of
surprises around here.
Parole hearing?
This soon?
He fingered a dirty guard up
at Jessup, apparently.
Got a big gold star
next to his name.
That's some bullshit.
Not to worry.
They send me the hearing
notifications for a reason.
"Mr. Barksdale ran a continuous,
violent criminal enterprise
and was a major drug trafficker. "
"During the years 1999 to 2002
he was strongly suspected
to have ordered or caused
the deaths of over
a dozen individuals. "
Parole commission's not gonna
walk him on his first trip to the plate.
Not after a letter like that.
Good work.
I have my moments.
Nice suit, by the way.
Thanks.
I see you dress left.
Everyday.
<i>The number you've called
is no longer in service. </i>
<i>If you feel you've reached
this recording in error</i>
<i>please check
the number and dial... </i>
<i>Nothing?</i>
That address up off Reisterstown.
Same one he was
showing two years ago
when I ran the car he was using.
Stringer's a settled guy.
Not there he ain't.
Woman living there,
last time I checked.
Just a front name.
His girl maybe.
Not unless he likes 'em over
50 and asshole ugly.
I'm sure she's real nice though.
Good school spirit...
always says "hi" to you in the halls.
You think he met her in college?
What, what'd I say?
What you got?
Tag comes back to
an address over on Dukeland.
Female, 53 years...
See? That's how they do...
But I got a hit on a Marlo,
street name of Black.
Marlo Stanfield.
22 years
BPI number
and a pretty good sheet.
What, you thought he'd be cherry?
Oh, I knew he had his cherry
busted, but not like this.
Check it out.
Think I'm gonna take
a ride downtown to homicide.
Wanna come?
Nope, got someplace to be.
This thing with Lester?
I feel like shit about it.
Well, you get used to it...
<i>We roll up
and get out of the car. </i>
<i>Crowd parts like the red sea. </i>
<i>Victim on the ground,
bleeding all over the place. </i>
<i>Screaming "I'm going
to kill that fucking bitch. "</i>
<i>But nothing's really
wrong with him... </i>
Ah, shit.
You tried to sneak
by me, didn't ya?
I was just comin' in
quiet and respectful.
Well, for a big man,
you do have a dancer's grace.
But I, sir, I have
the eyes of an eagle.
And the fact that you tried
to slither into your work space undetected
does not bode well for the recovery
prospect of our missing firearm, does it?
I'll get it.
What up, Mr. Bunk?
Hey, girlfriend.
Vernon Holley working tonight?
Uh, yeah, he's four-to-twelve.
You should try the coffee room.
Alright.
Man, I would murder that.
If she wasn't...
particular?
<i>Hey Busfield, that line
is blinkin' for you. </i>
- Find that gun.
- Yeah, okay.
Motherfuck you, too.
Marlo Stanfield
A.K.A. Black.
Boy's the spawn of the devil, Kima.
I see.
Y'all damn near
had him on this murder.
What happened?
We had a wit.
Boy they called Pooh Bear,
chubby fella with braids.
We stashed Pooh over
in east Baltimore.
Even had him wear one of
those e-lectronic bracelets
so we could find him quick.
You lost him?
Not exactly.
Pooh went back to the Westside
to cop some hydro.
He could've bought the same
weed where he was, right?
We found him with two in his
chest and one in his mouth.
The bracelet led us right
to the spot where he fell.
Those things work.
Marlo's serious.
That motherfucker's real.
I dunno, I think a volcano's
way better than a computer.
You see computers every day.
How often do you see a volcano?
Yeah, like I built the computer.
Hey, you built the volcano.
Big whoop.
Can I keep it?
Yeah, if you want to.
- Night, Mikey.
- Night.
- Sleep tight.
- Okay.
It's good that you came.
He's very proud.
Glad to.
Jimmy, um, there's
a problem with the alimony.
What's the problem?
You're behind by like four months.
What can I tell you?
I'm paying 2,000 a month in support.
After that, there's nothing left.
Right.
But you signed a separation
agreement that gives me
another 1,000 in alimony...
Elena, I only signed that fucking thing
'cause I thought we'd be together.
Look at how much I make
I'm not even close to being able
to pay that much every month.
My lawyer says that
we have to serve you.
What, that suit of a boyfriend
won't cough up any cash?
Blood from a stone, darlin'.
Beginning today
you can sell drugs
in west Baltimore
but only where we say you can.
Push 'em.
Hard.
Get to it, people.
And don't get captured.
Stay right there.
Get him up against the wall.
Hey, listen to what
I'm tellin' you.
You know, kids.
This is a simple fucking
thing we're saying here.
If you stay on this corner,
you're going in a wagon.
If you move yourself
down to the free zone
down to the vacants
along Vincent Street
then you can do
whatever the fuck you want.
How much fairer can we be?
Yeah, I saw that, you little fuck.
What's your name?
You got a name?
Peanut Butter and Jelly.
Address?
What's your address?
I stay over on Dolphin Street.
Your address, numbnuts.
Are there any numbers on the
front of your fucking house?
Listen up.
This corner is indicted.
We're coming back
tomorrow and when we do
everybody wears bracelets...
unless you move your shit
down to Vincent Street
down where the houses are all vacant.
You do that, we don't give a shit.
Vincent Street is like Switzerland.
Or Amsterdam.
The fuck is that?
It's one of those countries
where drugs are legal.
Vincent Street is
your Amsterdam in Baltimore.
You go down there,
we don't give a fuck.
You stay here, you go to jail.
I ain't goin' to no Hamsterdam.
Killed a witness, huh?
The way that Vernon Holley
told it, yeah.
So, Marlo's a hitter.
Maybe he works for Stringer.
Makes sense.
If you need me,
I'm gonna be Westside.
What about you?
I gotta get the scent
of my boy, Stringer.
We been off him too long.
What's your first move?
Something Prez said.
P- and-p?
B- and-b, like the liquor.
You mean, liqueur, Plauzinski...
Prez-blew-skee.
Benedictine and brandy.
That was invented by
a bartender over at Club 21.
All that good shit
comes outta New York.
I need every deed transfer
involving that company, Harry.
Today.
Yo, I'm asking them corner boys
if they know where
the Barksdale package be at?
They lookin' at me
like I ain't even talkin'.
On this strip,
Marlo's the name ringin' out.
There he is.
Ya see him?
He didn't stay too long.
Marlo's ghostin'.
We're kinda sensitive about
giving out personal data
on matriculating students.
Well, I could come back
with a court order.
Then'd have to give it to you.
My man has serious
issues with women.
Domestic violence,
really ugly stuff.
I can't show you any paper.
But let me get my screen up.
What did we tell you?
What'd we fuckin' tell you, man?
We told you to get your selves
down to the free zone, didn't we?
We're tryin'
to give you guys a break.
We're offerin' you, uh...
amnesty.
You take your crew
down to Vincent Street
you do your dirt,
nobody's gonna bother you.
Whad'ya say?
You guys fucking braindead?
Whad'ya say?
Yo, chief how you gonna come
up here and try to game us?
Say what?
I'm sayin' ya actin' like
we retarded or somethin'.
Better we put a foot in your ass?
Least we'd understand it.
This ain't a trick, shitbird.
Look: we grind,
and y'all try to stop it.
That's how we do.
Why you gotta go
and fuck with the program?
All due respect.
Nothing but tumbleweeds.
Get me some buses.
Tomorrow, we clean the corners
put 'em all in one place
and give 'em the news.
And I'm not asking anymore.
From here to Freemont
you got Barksdale's people
eastsiders and freelancers, too.
On the same corners?
Yup.
That shit don't make sense.
Yo, can we call it a day, Kima?
Bullshit, man.
You too?
What the fuck is up
with these phones?
I be seein' kids
throwin' them away all day.
They got cash
like that to waste?
These shits be layin' all over.
Sometimes you get lucky
find some minutes on 'em
sell 'em for walkin' around money.
They burners, Kima.
Burners?
Marone, another murder.
In Waverly, no less.
You believe it?
I would be fuckin' shocked
if it was an african-american
perpetrated the crime.
It ain't even funny, Ang.
This is why everyone's leaving this city,
black and white.
I was at a community meeting
Sunday in west Baltimore.
People were spittin' mad.
And I can't say I blame them.
Well, they could move
to a better neighborhood.
That is, if they were
willing to work for it.
Come on, I been hearin' all that
my-poor-immigrant-father-made-it
- so-why-can't-the-blacks
bullshit my whole life.
You think there's not good
people on the Westside
who want the same things that you...
Okay, Mrs. Roosevelt.
All's I'm sayin' is,
it's not about color.
So what's your next move, Tommy?
The Sun says an Anderson's state
senate seat is up for grabs.
Fuck that, you could go after
Ruppersberger in the second.
He's only got one term.
I'm gonna run for mayor.
Mayor Tommy.
She in the right joint?
She lets me sit next to her,
I buy her a drink...
We each give you 10.
20 if you fuck her.
Oh please, show just
a little more class, besides
I already had my day in the sun.
Bullshit, Tommy.
Once a gash-hound...
The bet is the bet,
you said I lost a step.
I'm gonna prove I never did.
- You in, Pete?
- I'll pass.
The sonofabitch did it.
He did you.
That's Theresa d'Agostino.
Mario Dee's kid?
Yeah, she grew up alright.
She's down in D.C.
Now with the national party.
A campaign fixer.
No shit.
Tommy's known her
ever since law school.
Just hear me out, okay?
- One drink.
- Go ahead.
You're paying for it.
Actually, they are.
You made a bet.
Don't tell me we have
to kiss or something.
Not gonna happen.
This isn't about ankle straps
and a two-and-a-half star hotel, is it?
Because the Alumni dinner
ended an hour ago
and I could be back
in D.C. right now...
That's the old me, Terri.
Everything I got now,
my wife, my kids...
I would not risk losing them.
No way.
Seeing you with your old gang
made me think bad thoughts.
Your friends cheapen you, Tommy.
You're just pissed off
that they didn't recognize you
when you walked in.
And why would they?
I mean, you're a Washingtonian now.
That's Pete Sinopoli
over there, isn't it?
I hear he's back to practicing law.
Yeah.
He just didn't have it, did he?
I have it, Terri.
I'm gonna make a run for mayor.
And you're gonna run my campaign.
Gimme one good reason why not to.
I could give you 10.
But here's the good one:
You're the wrong color.
You're not electable here.
And I never play the longshot.
You like to win.
I don't like to lose.
It's not the same thing.
But where's the fun in it
if you know you're gonna win?
I mean, you handled that
democrat in east L.A.
What was his name, Garcia...
- Valdez.
- Valdez.
How hard was that?
I need someone like you on my side.
I need you.
How big a win bonus?
Get a white mayor elected
in Baltimore, honey
you name your price.
One drink was the deal.
Go home, sleep it off.
You'll wake up and realize
you're making a mistake.
I can do this.
Question is, are you
gonna come with me?
B and B.
<i>Hello?</i>
Yo, how we not going to throw
a few hot ones at the motherfuckers?
One ass-whuppin' an'
we back off like some bitches.
Now we on this
off-brand strip right here.
Not even enough trade
for poot and his crew.
This is bullshit, man.
Look, man, String gonna
fix it, you'll see.
Which one a y'all is Slim Charles?
Who ask?
That be Cutty.
Your boy gave me a number,
said to ring you up
when I was ready
to put in some work.
But no answer.
Took your time
callin' back, right?
Numbers don't play
after a few days, man.
- We change 'em up.
- Ain't you know nothin'?
Respect, dawg, respect.
Y'all don't know
who ya'll talkin' to, man.
You still ain't say your business.
I'm tryin' to get put on.
What you got in mind?
Whatever you got that pays.
Yo, Poot.
Come here, man.
Hey, look, man, call Shamrock, man.
And tell him that soldier
finally came into the camp.
You a soldier, huh?
Chill, Bodie, man, chill, man.
Bodie Broadus?
Yeah, that's right.
Shit, I remember your little ass
when you was still in diapers.
I used to spar with
your older brother, James.
That boy had a killer left.
Yeah, when he ain't drop it.
He still out here?
James been dead.
Fuck's up with that cheesebox?
You ain't never rid
no school bus before?
I'm sayin', what they doin'
with the niggas on that corner?
Look, dawg.
First thing, we gonna need
to do is get you some chrome.
C'mon, man.
My phone... shit.
Yo, T.J. You got one
with some minutes left?
...which is not to say that
you couldn't do some multi-use
with the Howard Street
properties, too.
Residential-commercial could work.
On Howard Street?
The whole point
of the block grant
is to bring the Westside back
and make it high-end.
The hippodrome project
was just a start, see?
But residential?
With the stadium
and the theater back on line
that whole area is like inner
harbor east 10 years ago.
And the thing is
you're on the ground floor
with what you're holding.
Yes, you are String.
So we're still talking more
return than just flipping
the properties for
the condemnation money.
Way more.
Excuse me.
Yo.
Naw.
Not right now.
A half hour.
No, Sir, go ahead and fill it up.
You got the order number, right?
Move your ass.
Man, this some bullshit.
My moms is gonna
be worried, and shit.
Y'all is kidnappin' niggas.
I'm Major Colvin.
My name is Major Colvin.
<i>Major what?</i>
<i>Major these, motherfucker. </I>
And we had to bring you down
here this afternoon
because you've not been
complying with our directives.
Say what?
You're haven't been doing
what we asked you to do.
When I'm done.
I gotta pee now.
He ain't playin'.
Smell like he already
pissed in his drawers.
Alright, go ahead.
Yo, I gotta go, too.
Well, you're just
gonna have to wait.
You just let him go,
how you gonna discriminate?
Yo, faggy, why you touch my butt?
That's enough.
The fun is over.
Tyrell.
Why weren't you in school today?
My stomach hurt.
I couldn't make it out the baff-room.
Stand up when I talk
to you, young man.
I know your mother, Tyrell.
She didn't raise any clowns.
- Now did she?
- No, ma'am.
It's yours, Major.
Now, ladies and gentlemen
we brought you down here because...
you're here to learn
about the new way...
<i>the new way that we're going
to do things on the corners... </i>
That's downtown.
Well, that makes no sense.
All four.
Go ahead, rip me
a new asshole
and ask me where
I been for two days.
'Tell us, hotshot.
College registrar gives up
Stringer's course schedule.
I tail him to where
he's laying his head.
Downtown high-rise.
Name's on the lease, too.
No attempt to hide it.
I get up early next morning,
follow him from his door
to a lunch meeting
with the State Senator.
Same one with the bag man
we bounced the last time around.
Couple of white guys
at the table, too, but nobody I read.
And all the while, Stringer's
using his cell phone.
Making calls in front of these
suits like it ain't no thing.
Shit, I even
rang it up myself.
Got his number from
an admissions form.
Number wouldn't be 732-8793?
I had Prez pull the B-and-B
property assessments
and land transfers
from circuit court.
Some of the paperwork
asked for a contact number.
So, I'm not surprised our boy's
using his cell phone so freely.
Those right there are the incoming
and outgoing numbers on his phone.
Damn near all of them
are downtown exchanges.
Architectural firms, city licensing...
attorneys, zoning offices.
Even campus exchanges
over at B.C.C.C.
You sayin' he's right?
I'm saying the phone is right.
Account information confirms
he's had that number listed...
for quite awhile.
Nice work.
Maybe the cell phone is clean
because he's keeping it.
If it was dirty,
it probably be a burner.
Disposables.
The latest in yo tech.
They make a few calls with
a burner, throw it away.
Go on to the next phone,
do the same.
There's more of those things
laying around the streets
of west Baltimore than empty vials.
Well, how the fuck you supposed
to get a wire up on that?
Yeah, well, first it
was payphones and pagers.
Then it was cell phones
and face-to-face meets.
Now this.
The motherfuckers do learn.
Every time we come at them,
they learn and adjust.
So...
Stringer's out of reach.
You know, a couple years ago
when they were buying up
all that downtown real estate
I thought they were
buying it to flip it
and get the cash when
the federal payout money lands
and the properties are condemned.
Bell and Barksdale
haven't sold any of it.
They're buying more, in fact,
and applying for building permits.
Seems that Stringer Bell's
worse than a drug dealer.
He's a developer.
Jesus fuck, he's really legit?
Well, you real police?
Now that he's out in the open,
why don't you pull him up and ask him?
You need a few days,
I'll stall Daniels.
But after that, you come home
with a case we can use
or you swallow your got-damn
pride and rejoin this unit.
How you doin', Donette?
I'm fine, String.
I missed you, baby.
Look, I'm sorry for
not returning them calls.
Sorry don't keep
my bed warm at night.
Shorty, I been runnin'.
Ain't like I'm trying
to shut you out
I just got business
to attend to, you know?
Do you know how it feels
to be alone out here?
Police comin' to my door,
and I got no one to stand beside me.
You said the detective
left you... a card.
Man say D'angelo
wadn't no suicide.
Somethin' about the way
the marks was on his neck.
He said Dee coulda
been murdered, and shit.
Sit down.
Now listen to me.
Everyone in them walls
know who Avon is.
Ain't nobody
gonna do his nephew.
Alright?
Now as far as you
and me go.
I did you wrong by keeping
you at arm's length.
But it ain't gonna
be like that no more.
God made that.
Couldn't be no accident.
So why am I
on your tab tonight?
Tell the truth.
I dare that to walk by me again.
She better not.
Why you buyin', Bunk?
I got two dead
in what feels like
a drug rip up in Pimlico.
An' the younguns out on the scene
they seem to know
this Omar fella by sight.
I need Omar, Jimmy.
Again?
Jesus, Bunk.
Yeah...
Fuck it, then.
Number three?
Ah, that worked for you last time.
- That blonde by the juke...
- Oh, I really liked her.
Everybody likes everybody
when the kissin'.
But no, my friend
down there
she's a number two, I think.
And when it comes up,
my mother passed...
a week ago
and I'm havin' a little
trouble gettin' over it.
That's why I'm feeling
so blue tonight.
Okay, your mom's dead
and you're sad.
Yeah.
You my boy.
The same way.
My mom died about a week ago...
Yo. What's up, boss?
You got the phone receipts
from the Virginia run?
Alright.
From now on, I want you
to deal with these.
Alright.
If my man Bernard doin' it like
we said and makin' them runs
then I don't wanna have
to deal with this no more.
For sure.
And if Donette call me...
I know.
Tell that bitch you busy.
No.
I'm gonna take the call.
Ronnie.
Ronnie, Ronnie!
Rhonda!
...it was strongly
suspected to have ordered
or caused the deaths of
over a dozen individuals. "
Suspected.
It's rumor and innuendo.
There isn't one new allegation
in this letter that wasn't already raised
by the assistant state's attorney
at the time of the trial.
And given my client's
superlative record
during his incarceration
and given his notable role
in identifying the source
of the overdose deaths
at this facility last year
I respectfully ask that you
honor our existing agreement
and approve Mr. Barksdale's
early release.
- That's bullshit!
- Hold your comments, trooper.
We made a commitment, Counselor.
And given what this institution
was dealing with a year ago
this is the lesser evil.
<i>Rockefeller.
Rockefellers on the spot. </i>
That's him right there.
In that G35, man.
Boy in the retro?
That shit is tight.
$430, it better be.
Hell, yeah.
I'm 'onna get me
one of those motherfuckers.
You better get
the mugsy bogues, then.
'Cause your mini-me ass
gonna swim in that unseld.
As usual, y'all fools
is missin' my point.
That boy came up short
on that money last week.
Y'all see he get grindin'.
So where that money at?
You need to look beyond
what he driving or wearin' on his back.
That boy got a girlfriend?
He run with this little freak
up at the high school.
She wearin' ice?
She wearin' an onion, that's
about all I can remember.
Check out the girl.
High school girl with
platinum around her neck
only one place it came from.
Give my man his thing.
Sig Sauer.
That ain't no lorcin, yung.
I'm used to revolvers, man.
38 don't jam.
Don't hold 15, neither.
Game done changed.
Game's the same.
Just got more fierce.
I'm not big on vacations.
Who has time?
What about taking the boys
down to Ocean City for
a weekend or somethin'?
You ever been down the ocean?
Listen...
wasn't like I was waiting
for an opening with Rhonda.
It just happened.
I shoulda told you sooner.
I need to know that this isn't going to be
a thing between you and me.
Nah, I wish you both all the best.
Was I very loud last night?
Thanks for making this easy on me.
You coming?
Nah, think I'll stay here
a while and nurse this
then I'll shove off.
One more,
an' put a beer next to it.
Was up?
You good?
Look at you, alright.
Shit is on.
This what I'm talkin' about.
Drink that shit.
Surprised Avon be lettin'
y'all get your heads up.
Sometimes you got to.
Kiss the sky, nigga.
Ready to go?
Yeah. Are you alright to drive?
I thought you were the
designated driver tonight?
No, I'm good, really.
I'm good to go.
G'night.
Bitch with one leg named Aaliyah.
What kind of shit is that?
Oh, shit.
You do still like
females, don't ya?
He home now.

No, Bubs.
I mean, there's gotta be rules
or else things get fucked up.
Ain't no rules
for dope fiends.
When the police got you shackled up,
you make a move, right?
You help yourself out.
But you just start
snitchin' for no reason...
it doesn't make no...
Let me track this.
You hypopulatin' that you can
tattle-tale when you locked up
but you can't do it
straight up for the money?
I mean, no offense, son, but...
that some weak-ass thinkin'.
You equivocatin' like a motherfuck.
- Okay, so a snitch is a snitch, right?
- There you go.
So why be one, man?
I mean, we gettin'
by with our capers.
We gettin' by out here
every damn day
rippin' and runnin' and ain't
got shit to show for it.
It's part of being a soldier?
I mean, that's true, right,
that's what you says.
That was 'fore I put all
this mileage on these feet.
You wait, you wait,
till you ain't a pup no more,
see if you ain't lookin'
for somethin' a little more,
a little more steady
for your ownself.
What the fuck?
You gettin' ill already.
It's not even past morning.
I'm cool, man.
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Look, we hook up with
my girl Kima, we get paid
you gonna be better.
Fuck that, Bubs, alright?
I'm not a fuckin' snitch.
You know...
I could argue the other side.
Say that if you drop dime
to duck a charge, then you a snitch.
You do it as a living,
you a professional.
Hold up, hold up,
hold up, hold up.
You see that, that ladder right there.
Just like old times, man.
I'll be the bad guy,
you be the lone ranger.
Leave that man be.
We get paid more
hooking up to my girl.
But that's cash money
right there.
With the white man,
I best be the bad guy.
That way he ain't confused.
Alright, meet me in the alley.
Fuck.
Yo, Mister.
Yo.
Throw down your wallet, or I'm
a jerk this ladder right out.
What?
No, no!
I'm a poor man
who ain't playin'.
Throw down
the got-damn money.
Please, no.
Leave that man alone.
Thank you.
He's crazy, man.
What's that guy doing?
Oh, shit.
- Here, here.
- I can't, I can't.
No, you saved my ass.
It's appreciated you know.
Yo, Bubs.
You won't fuckin' believe this.
Bubs?
Straight and True
<i>Dennis, you up?</i>
<i>Dennis?</i>
Mee-maw, hey.
Guess you're not
workin' today, huh?
I'm workin' nights now.
At a bar.
Workin' the door.
You know, it's just...
just 'til I find
somethin' a little bit better.
Reminds me.
Your friend called
again this morning.
She said for you
to remember your appointment.
Says there's a job in it,
if you still lookin'.
So, Marlo, right?
He got this one boy
watchin' his back
name be Chris Partlow.
Barlow with a "b"?
Part, like white people
got in their hair.
And low, like
a low-bottom dope fiend.
- Partlow.
- Yeah, what I said.
So, he's Marlo's muscle?
So...
how much is that worth?
Five, if I can
work up a photo id.
The boy, Fruit, he used that.
Fruit who runs
one of Marlo's corners?
Careful, it's got prints.
Prints, huh?
Look at you, gettin' all
C.S.I. on me and shit.
A burner with prints.
That's gotta mean cash money, right?
If I can pull a print, get Fruit id'd,
I can go to ten.
An' if I show you where
Marlo hides his Mercedes.
The Benz would go for 15.
You don't know it, but these
are hard times in a hard land.
You killin' me out here, girl.
A- ight.
25 for the Benz.
You good peoples.
So let's total up
we at 40, right?
Here.
Bank that for me.
Bank it?
For what?
Got me a plan, girl.
The hoppers out here
they only be wearin' them big white shirts
a couple of times 'fore they chuck 'em.
So I'm thinkin' while I'm out
here workin' for y'all
I'ma get my ends up, sell 'em
shirts on the corners.
I'll make my nut
comin' an' goin'.
Truthfully, I don't know
what more you could have done.
Charlie's right, boss.
You tried.
Fuckin' hoodleheads
won't cooperate.
Here you are, giving 'em
their own block or two
offering them a place
to sell drugs in peace
and do they even
fuckin' listen?
It's a damn shame, too,
'cause if it worked
you mighta had a positive
effect on the community.
<i>Shift commander
call the front desk. </i>
You guys are some
lying sacks of shit.
I'm sayin', sir...
I'm guessin' that you
have some thoughts on where
we should go from here.
Well, sir, we were thinkin'
a modified zebra operation.
Jumpouts rotating from sector-to-sector,
combined with a zero tolerance approach.
We detail a couple
of men from each shift
build a flex unit
double up on the head-knocking
and corner-clearing.
More of the same, you mean.
But better.
Better?
Better than nothing.
Ah, fuck this bullshit already!
Man, they gave us 15 cases of legal
but they shorted us
on the colored bonds...
what's going on there?
I got this.
Officer.
Detective, String.
You remember?
Bird trial, detective McNulty.
You want something copied, man?
Search warrant?
Court papers?
Anything I do to help, you know?
I ain't seen you around the way.
I'm not around the way no more.
You wanna find me, I'm right here.
Right here, huh?
This an' some real estate
I'm workin' on is all.
You know?
More than enough
to occupy me, really.
Say where you livin', man?
Where am I living?
Well, if you thinkin'
a comin' downtown
I got some condos about to come
on the line in eight months.
You say the word, I'ma hook you
up something nice down there
by the hippodrome.
Loft apartments.
Real nice.
You disappoint me, String.
I had such fuckin' hopes for us.
Have a nice day, officer.
You see this shit?
Remember that kid
who got shot in the parking lot
at Lake Clifton
a couple months back?
Drug feud, right?
What about it?
Well, last night, they just
found the only eyewitness.
In an alleyway,
buncha holes in him.
And?
What do you mean, "and"?
You're talking about
a state's witness.
You let a witness get killed in
a high-profile case like this
it says the city's
broke and can't be fixed.
Sounds like we found an issue.
Fuck the politics for a minute.
You know, this is something
we all need to be on the same page with.
I'm serious, Tony.
You let shit like this stand,
pretty soon you got nothing left.
You gonna go public
and bang the Mayor with it?
You gonna bang Burrell
and the state's attorney then?
I ain't gonna bang nobody.
Like I said, fuck the politics for once.
But there is a problem here
and I'm gonna do something to fix it.
You want your cape
and the little red underpants?
Or you stash that shit
in the phone booth?
I always wondered about that.
Man, I like a piece of that.
You'd like any piece at all.
I think I'd like
a piece of your mother.
Yo, stop fuckin' around!
He started that shit.
Yo, she got our boy
with his nose wide open.
He's stealing from us,
and she most likely the reason for it.
And y'all stay with the girl,
she'll soon enough show us the money.
Hey, where you goin'?
Yo, I got something I got to do.
You supposed to be here
on this shit with us.
Y'all stay with the girl,
I'll get back with y'all down the way.
Say what?
Yo, I made a date a while back.
Gotta keep it.
Man made a date, gotta keep it.
You find out he pussy-whipped
like this motherfuck over here.
Now, once again, from the data:
When are most cars stolen?
Sir, at night.
And your unit, which I believe is
charged with deterring the theft of autos
when do you work?
The day shift, eight-to-four.
But sir, as I tried to explain...
Your position is clear:
You affect more arrests of car thieves
during the daylight than at night.
You see, our ears work.
We heard you.
But the question becomes:
Why the fuck can't you hear us?
- Sir, I don't...
- The Commissioner is attempting
to move this department
from the dark ages into the 21st century.
That means preventing crime
by relying on computer generated data
not on your
fly-by-your-fucked-up-ass instinct.
Give me the auto theft numbers
for downtown parking lots
on friday nights.
Sir, I have to check that.
Where are we with the gun?
Colonel, I was made to understand
that recovering officer Dozerman's
lost weapon was a priority.
Oh, the gun, yes, we're on it, sir.
Making progress as we speak.
Lieutenant?
Sir, I now understand that
prevention is the way to go
and will immediately change
our hours to reflect the data.
Alright, Lieutenant.
Fecal gravity.
Hey, you beat on the right people
and the shit rolls down the hill.
Dennis is it?
Cutty works for me.
Cutty then.
So, um, it's just
gonna be us here?
You know...
I mean, Grace.
Sister Grace
called on your behalf
but to my knowledge,
she didn't plan to be here.
She's a beautiful woman.
A man might say things he didn't mean
to stand closer to a woman like that.
You're in the job market
though, I understand.
A couple of questions.
You got a high school diploma?
G.E.D.?
Any work experience?
I worked in a warehouse
for a couple of months back in like '86.
How do you see
the church helping you?
Maybe give me some jobs or...
put my name on a list or somethin'.
I dunno.
I should tell you up front,
we don't do like that here.
You want a job, you're gonna
have to work to get it.
We'll help.
But it's gonna be your sweat.
With that said, then, the first thing is to
get you enrolled in a G.E.D. program...
Look, I don't mean to put you out,
but this...
this ain't how I thought
it was gonna play.
Me, Oscar, a bunch of the guys,
we seen it.
Couldn't help it.
They practically ran right past us.
And the victim, the girl...
had a gun?
Whose side was she on?
Couldn't tell, it weren't
doin' slow motion.
Did any of them have a big scar?
Do you think you'd be able to recognize
any of them again if you saw them?
- Just Omar.
- So, you know Omar?
Omar came up 'round here.
That's good, bruiser, very good.
You do know Omar
has a scar, right?
He do?
I think we better go to my
office, put this down on paper.
Come on.
Officer.
Excuse me, officer.
Is this... North and Pulaski?
'Cause I could fucking swear
Dozerman was shot up at North and Pulaski.
Wait, wait, lemme guess
the pursuit of your fellow
officer's service weapon
has led you to this fine citizen.
Tell me, kind sir, do you know
the whereabouts of said officer's weapon?
I didn't think so.
Calls from the detention center.
Some kind souls begging to assist you
in your foundering investigation.
Lemme just grand jury my man here.
Lock in his story.
Now for the gun. Later for his story.
And that's your sergeant talking.
Yo, wipe your nose, yo.
- What the fuck...
- Oh shit!
Motherfucker, you scared the shit
out of us coming up like that.
Shit do make you paranoid, yo.
G'head, nigga, hit this shit.
Naw, man, I gotta
drop urine tomorrow.
Yo, you worried about that?
Go 'head, nigga.
- We got that covered.
- Oh, you got that covered.
What?
You think you're the only
motherfucker on parole?
- Yo, nigger, gimme that shit.
- There you go.
A- ight.
What was her day?
She caught a hack up
to Towsontown mall.
Hit two jewelry stores and
came back with bags from both.
By the time she
caught up with our boy
she was wearin' one of them
shits around her neck.
Gave the other one to him.
You know, his an' hers, like.
Yeah, Cutty.
You was on that shit, man.
It's been a week, McNulty.
Either you got something
on Stringer or you don't.
He tried to sell me a condo.
Cocksucker.
Might as well join the Rotary.
Take up golf or someshit.
He's runnin' with the hounds
though I'll bet his heart
is still with the fox.
Stringer's out of the game?
Mr. Bell has become the bank.
The bank?
The bank plays it legit,
he generates a good bit of honest income.
But at the same time, his money finances
packages that he himself will never touch.
He won't go near the street.
He's insulated from the every day
operations on the corners.
The money that comes back
is then laundered through
enough straight business investments
that there's no way to trace it.
A player gets to that point,
there ain't no way
in hell a working police
is going to tie a can to his tail.
Oh, man.
So, Kintel Williamson,
the prince of Pimlico.
Where we at on this mope?
DNR's on a couple of payphones.
That got it?
Alright.
You gonna help or what, boy?
Might as well not
even take a whistle
if all I'm doin' is
standin' in the fuckin' alley!
Back's where you belong.
That'a way I ain't got to be worryin'
'bout gettin' my damn head blown off
'cause you all scared and shit.
Enough!
You all hear me, I said enough?!
Come over and put some pumpkin
balls in this shotgun, man.
Kimmy!
Both of y'all learn to live
with it or y'all out, man.
Now, this time
we gonna do it right.
Ya all feel me?
Boss, you gotta let this go.
It ain't gonna work.
You said it in comstat:
Shit rolls down.
Now, we tried to talk to all the hoppers,
what the hell can they do about anything?
We need to bring it to the dealers.
Sergeant.
I need a list of names
of all the mid-level dealers
running my corners.
Sir?
You're my D.E.U. Sergeant, right?
I need a list of names.
Maybe narcotics downtown has
something like that, I dunno.
We're knocking heads, taking bodies.
I didn't know I was supposed
to be doin' a census or nothing.
Hey, yo, miss. Miss?
Where the peepot at?
Thanks.
Come on, this way.
Yo, my man you need
to drop a negative.
Five dollars.
Motherfucker, they was just two.
You try findin' clean piss in Baltimore.
Five a go.
Yo, how I know it's clean?
I get mine from day care...
I need you to put the chicken
in the oven at 375.
Yes, and after you've done that
I need you to help me
put your sister down...
Excuse me, miss.
Put your thumb on the scanner.
Hold on a second.
What's your name?
Wise, Dennis Wise.
Take one of those.
Go around the corner to the second door.
No, you can not go outside.
Are you listening
to what I'm saying?
That's all we got
on the Westside dealers.
George...
I'm lookin' at a sprinklin'
of rap sheets here.
You tellin' me nobody
in this department
knows who controls the West
Baltimore corners anymore?
Hey, Rawls has my people
doing street rips.
You want up-to-date info,
you should try the intelligence unit.
- Shit, they sent me to you, George.
- What the fuck can I tell you?
With all the street work
there ain't nobody left
doin' high-end drug stuff.
From what I'm hearing
the guy comes in of his own accord
and he gets betrayed by us.
Protection in this city
amounts to nothing
more than getting dumped
in a fleabag joint on route 40
and calling it a plan.
No monitoring, no assistance.
Nothing just a bundle of
clothes and a toothbrush.
Jesus.
No way to treat a cooperator.
I know someone could get a lot of mileage
out of this with the press.
But fuck that, right?
Because if I go that way
then everyone gets defensive
and nothing gets fixed.
I'm coming to you
with this straight-up.
Agreed.
Where do we stand on this?
You've already called
for a meeting on this
with the State's Attorney
and the Police Commissioner.
It's penciled in
for next wednesday.
No, no, Tommy's right on this,
we need to act quickly.
I'm glad you
came to us with this.
I'll light a fire, believe me.
Thanks.
You will keep me
in the loop on this?
Absolutely, Councilman.
Hey, slow up, girlfriend,
we need to talk for a minute.
Yeah, sweet thin'.
We met before?
No, baby, but that can happen.
- We ain't met, excuse me.
- Hey, it's just talk, baby.
Get the fuck out, boy.
Look, girl, all we need
for you to do is talk...
Is you deaf or just stone stupid?
Hold on, girl...
Now, we gonna talk.
How the fuck
is this little runt of a unit
holding all this
drug intelligence?
I made the rounds
down at headquarters
came up with Jack,
and you're holding all this?
Well, you run a couple wiretaps,
you fill up a file cabinet pretty fast.
This is great, thanks.
Oh, shit!
Goddamnit.
I heard this was where you landed.
This pretty boy?
I broke his ass in.
I wrote more on I.I.D. complaints
on bushy top here
than on the whole
goddamn squad.
That is 'til he scuffed himself up.
Now where you at, McNulty?
1911 South Clinton Street,
first floor.
There you go.
I know you got to keep him close
but still
some good goddamn
police right here.
So what brings you to our shop?
I'm tryin' to find out
who running my corners.
My own D.E.U. is just about street rips
and headquarters wadn't no help neither.
Y'all saved my ass, though.
You tell him about your boy...
MarloĀ?
It's in the files
along with every other
mid-level player we know.
You don't mind me asking?
What're you gonna do
with all that, Major?
Well...
round up these young men
and put a little comstat
on they ass.
Gentlemen. Ma'am.
Bushy top.
Bushy top?
<i>Call to order and shit. </i>
Chair recognize the esteemed rep.
of the Veronica Avenue boys.
Alright, look, we done
talked this shit to death. A-ight?
When we gonna vote?
Rick do have a point.
A- ight, then.
All those in favor
of goin' together
so we can get the best
discount on a New York package
raise up.
A- ight then.
There it is.
Look like we gonna
make more money...
together.
Got to say I'm proud
of y'all for puttin' aside
petty grievances an'
puttin' this thing together.
For a cold-ass
crew of gangsters
y'all carried it like
republicans an' shit.
Yo, remember, man,
talk this shit up when you hit them bricks.
Best way to get more
involved is to tell people
about the benefits
of this here thing.
No beefing. No drama.
Just business.
Anybody got a problem
with anybody else here
we bring it to the group.
We ain't gotta take it
to the streets.
A- ight.
Let's do it.
Yo.
Motherfucker, what is that?
Them Robert rules say we gotta have
minutes for a meeting, right?
These the minutes.
Nigga, is you takin' notes on
a criminal fucking conspiracy.
What the fuck
is you thinkin', man?
That's cool.
Dad, he's cheating.
Michael, take it easy
on your brother.
How are you two gettin' along
with mom's new friend?
We call him Dennis,
he's not new.
Okay, how are you
doin' with him?
Mom said we can't talk
to you about family stuff.
Dad, you goin' to the open house?
Yeah, I'll try, but I've been
real busy at work though.
New case an' all.
Mom says you have to go, dad.
Yeah, all the other kids'
fathers are gonna be there.
Get his legs.
Steal from us, motherfucker?
Get the ring, too, yo.
Shit won't come off, yo.
Drop him.
You know the man works for us.
You keep goin' at him like that
ain't gonna be nothing left of
him to make right what he owes.
Bitch got to pay.
Hey, yo, check his pockets, yo.
- That's mine, yo.
- Get the fuck off...
<i>... to security. </i>
Was' up, baby.
Yo, man, I been in here 26 months
an' you come pick me up
in a motherfuckin' Ford?
I'm just fuckin' with you.
Was' up, baby?
What up, man.
Man, I'm feeling real good
to be out of this motherfucker.
You know what?
There's a sign on the other
side of this gate that say "never again".
And that's the only fucking thin'
I'm gonna take with me from this place.
First thin' first,
let's get you lookin' right.
You know what I mean?
Oh, you got my shit.
Good looking, baby.
Start with sector one.
Bring as many as you can
down to the Vincent Street area
by the end of shift.
Don't use your wagons.
Bring as many as
you can in your cars.
The hoppers wouldn't listen.
What makes you think
these guys will?
These are...
the lieutenants running the corners
and I personally feel their pain.
Now, middle-management
means that you have
just enough responsibility
that you got to listen when people talk
and not so much
that you can tell anybody
to go fuck themselves.
Look, my major just wants to talk.
That's all, promise.
We'll bring you right back.
Ain't gonna happen.
The fuck you say?
What the fuck you mean
it ain't going to happen?
Let me tell you something,
motherfucker.
We got orders to bring
your sorry ass down
the way for a sit down
with our boss.
Now we're prepared
to take you with us right now.
We can either do this
the easy way or...
<i>braindead fucks... </i>
<i>Hello. </i>
Prez, it's me.
I think we got
a little situation here.
Stay with me, ten-six...
Major wants the dickhead,
he gotta go.
I think he gets a pass this time.
You sure?
I mean, you want, he goes.
Another time, Herc.
We're on the Major's clock here.
Don't forget the face, cocksucker,
there's gonna be a tomorrow.
<i>You need me to call dispatch?</i>
No, it's okay.
I'll tell you later.
I say we get the troops,
and fuck these assholes up.
Come on, let's go again.
C'mon, Tommy, it's just a game.
Look, sounds like you
got what you want, anyway.
From the Mayor, I mean.
Yeah, well, he's played me before
but so help me
if he farts around on this
I'm going after him. Big time.
For real?
Trust me on this.
He keeps ducking me
I'm going to fuck him good.
That's the good part.
It's what I call the carrot.
Now you move your people
into any designated area
I told you about
and you have immunity from
arrest and prosecution.
You're free to make your drops
collect what needs collectin'
and won't nobody bother you.
You've got my word on it.
What do you get out of this?
That's a fair question.
I want to salvage what's still
worth salvagin' in my district.
And I can't do that with a bunch
of young hoppers runnin' around
scarin' the hell
out of the decent people.
Now, these kids ain't gonna listen to me,
but they will listen to y'all.
Now, you tell them to move
down here and set-up shop
and they will.
So the way I got it figured
I motivate you,
and you motivate them.
Naw, this a trap.
No, you check out the spot.
There ain't no cameras,
ain't no microphones, nothing.
Any cops you see going to be
down right on the perimeter.
Just to make sure
there's no violence.
And you watch
you see if it don't
work out the way I say.
Nothin' personal
against you, chief, but...
what happens if we buck?
You remember the carrot, right?
Well, if you choose
the stick instead
you gonna feel that stick like
you ain't never felt before.
We gonna indict
every corner, every day.
I've got over 200 sworn
personnel and I plan to free up
every one of them to knock every
one of you y'all down they can.
If you're on a corner in my district
it ain't gonna be about no humble
it ain't gonna be about
no loitering charge, nothing like that.
There gonna be some biblical
shit happening to you on the way
to that motherfuckin' jail wagon.
You understand me?
And while you're
buckin' the new system,
the smart ones among you,
gonna be down here
makin' money
hand over fist.
So, think it over.
But I swear to god, come monday
your world and mine
ain't gonna be the same.
I thought you said these
goddamn houses were vacant.
We musta missed her.
There's one more thing
I gotta do then.
Little Man, up on "b" tier,
one of his boys in the dormitory
his brother's tight with the girlfriend
of the boy that shot that poh-leece.
Little Man sayin'
if you sprung the three of us
we could get her talkin',
you know, find the gun.
I'm hearin' the boy, Dink,
got that man's gun.
Now, I ain't sure yet if that
Dink be Dink Dink or Inky Dink
or maybe Fat Dink.
Then again,
it might be Flat Nose Dink.
No, wait
that can't
be him, that Dink dead.
Look, man, I can help you
but first you gotta get me out
from under these murder beefs.
How many murders we talkin'?
Look, man, do it have
to be the cop's gun?
'Cause if it's guns you want,
I can get you guns.
I remember this.
Sixth grade.
Mrs. Holley's science class.
Box lunches. Taste like shit.
You got somethin'
so important, man
you can't go through
the proper channels?
Well, no.
I don't know.
I just figured if
I told anybody but you
you might think
I'm ridin' the rock.
What makes me think you ain't?
Yeah, right.
That's a good point.
Look, today, me,
Tuckie, Little Mikey
man, we all...
A bunch of us got
scooped up by the police.
Well, you shouldn't sell drugs.
Alright, alright.
Nah see, they didn't
take us to the station.
They took us down to the
bottom of Vincent Street
where all the houses is boarded
up, and they let us out.
And then, on top of all of that
like the whole while they
were being all like...
decent and shit,
you know that fucked me up.
And then the police chief,
he come out.
And this is the crazy part
he say that he got it set up
so that we could sell stuff
in certain spots,
and the police won't bother us.
I know, I know. It's fucked up,
but I just thought you should know.
That's it?
Yeah, just that,
and the boy Marlo.
Yeah, I'm on it.
Yep.
2303 to K.G.A.
Have foxtrot meet me
on six, adam.
<i>Foxtrot, ten four. </i>
2303 to foxtrot.
<i>Foxtrot, standing by. </i>
It's a black Mercedes,
pulling out the lot.
<i>Copy that, we got the eyeball. </i>
This here the spot?
'Cause Tuckie says we supposed
to set-up shop here.
Hamsterdam.
Yeah, this is it.
Set-up anywhere inside where
we got the white flags.
- Yo, I'm getting ready to roll out.
- You just got here, what's wrong?
Ain't nobody 'round to buy.
Good point.
Man needs customers.
- I'm sayin'...
- Aw, no.
You can't make me.
I'm a sworn fucking police officer.
Was' up, man.
You got that bodybag still?
Two.
Narco!
Give it up, motherfucker.
Money comes back, right now.
Boss, you fuckin' up, man.
You didn't even let me cop
'fore you snatch me up.
Is that some fuckin' rule?
You call, we haul.
You clean?
Yeah, of course I'm clean
stupid ass rookie didn't
even give me a chance to cop.
This corner's indicted.
You move over to Vincent Street
or we come back with the bracelets.
<i>What you got?</i>
1011 me at Riggs and Calhoun.
Despite unforeseen delays,
we will begin an academy class
this january, which leaves us in
good shape for the coming year.
Thank you, Commissioner.
If the chair pleases,
I have a couple of questions.
Commissioner
I know you are aware
that a state's witness
in a recent city homicide
prosecution was killed.
We are treating that incident
with the highest priority.
Homicide has set-up a task force
and narcotics is working
the informant angle.
We have also asked both the
F.B.I. and D.E.A. for support.
It sounds like a full-court press
but you must admit
it's a bit like closing the barn
door after the horse is out.
I mean, the shooting
of the boy on the lot
at Lake Clifton high school
was a high-profile case
wasn't it, Commissioner?
Yes, it was.
And yet a key witness
in the case was allowed...
one moment...
excuse me, Commissioner,
but the chair was good enough
to remind me that you have
a pressing engagement.
So if it's alright with you,
we can continue this at a later date.
Meeting adjourned.
Did you see Burrell sweat?
The man's collar almost melted.
The hell got into you?
You did, old buddy.
You did.
Nend of the line, all out.
We got that Rockefeller, yo.
We got that Rockefeller
over here, yo.
Over here we got that
Rockefeller, yo.
Whatta fuck?
Yo, yo, we got
the Rockefeller, yo.
We got that W.M.D.
right here, right here.
I hear the W.M.D. is the bomb.
W.M.D. right here.
W.M.D.
Give me two, yo.
W.M.D. right here.
W.M.D. right here, right here.
Right here.
We got that Rockefeller over here.
Yo!
We got that Rockefeller, yo.
What do we got?
There's binoculars on the floor.
Marlo making a move?
Just watch.
Forget everythin'
the boy, Bodie, told you.
Forget the beatin',
it ain't about that.
You smart, man, I can see that.
I wanted you to choose
somewhere safe for us to speak.
But goddamn
only bugs in this
motherfucker gotta have legs.
Now, I appreciate smart
but you gotta know,
in this game, man, it ain't enough.
You a student of history?
You know this town had its
share of smart players, man?
Melvin, Little Wil, Big Head Brother,
Peanut, Warren.
All real smart, man, real smart.
You know, soon as
their names rang out, bam
the feds was on them.
You know what I mean?
The government they want you to be
organized, nah, they want you
scrimpin' and scrapin'
killin' each other on the
corners over some bullshit.
Not me.
That's why me and Prop Joe
we gettin' ready to put
this co-op together.
Different crews, one package.
Best dope, best coke.
Share and share alike.
I've been hearin' 'bout that.
You've been hearin' 'bout that?
That's good,
that's a start, right?
You know that Mercedes you
got ridin' out there, man
you got that titled in your
aunt's name or some shit.
Now, when they come get you
that straw purchase out there
gonna come bite you in the ass, boy.
That's what's they do.
Turn your money against you.
Now, you I'm thinkin'
with the corners you got
you close to a mil, right?
I'm doin' a-ight.
You doing a-ight
but a-ight ain't got you
a name on your crib, right?
Ain't got you a little spot
to wash that dirty money?
That what I'm offerin' you, man.
Come on, who's he in there with?
I told you, keep watchin'.
Did Bunk put you
up to this?
Tell you what, how about
a case of that PBR piss
you drink against a touch of the
Irish that he went out the back
and you're watching
that house for nothing.
Here comes your nothing.
I like my piss in bottles.
Anyway you like, darlin'.
Chris...
tell our people to tool up.
I'm on it.
I got that W.M.D., got that W.M.D.
They got comfortable
with it pretty quick.
Yeah, it's like we ain't
even standing here.
The hoppers call it Hamsterdam.
Like from Amsterdam.
Hamsterdam.
...are the use of integrated
math concepts such as
algebraic reasoning, and number
sines, geometry and probability.
Very impressive.
Now what we try to do is
keep the class size under 10
12 at the very most.
- And there are three levels?
- Yes, so that if...
Sorry, I'm Jim McNulty.
I'm runnin' a little late
because of work.
Mr. McNulty.
I have some concerns about
the integrated math program.
In their previous schools,
Michael took introductory algebra
but I understand that this school
is doing something different.
We are.
The integrated math program...
Excuse me, I'm thirsty
can I get either of you
somethin' to drink?
The integrated math
program here consist...
Not much of a spread, but you
can't go wrong with crudite.
Crudity?
I'm sorry, you know,
I came straight from work
or I'da changed.
No need to call names, right?
What do you do, Mr...
I'm on the board at Legg Mason.
Jim McNulty.
Legg Mason?
Either that or I'm a cop
in the city, I keep forgetting.
Terri d'Agostino.
I'm an alumna and one of
the school's dreaded fundraisers.
The math program offers
tutoring possibilities.
So if Michael finds it
difficult adjusting
we can have classes
on tuesdays and thursdays.
So how do you find the school?
It's good.
My ex and I are thinking
of sending our boys here.
- Any problems, difficulties?
- No, not really.
I mean, there's the math
integration class for my oldest.
He's in sixth, seventh, and...
I'm not sure he's ready,
you know, for all that math.
Careful, I'm only a country boy.
Shut up!
<i>Hey, sweetie, welcome home. </i>
Welcome back.
Hey, sis.
Aw, man.
I just wish I wasn't the only
one comin' home, you know?
I know.
Enjoy tonight, we'll talk later.
Welcome home.
What up, Prop,
how you feelin', man?
Alright.
You lookin' fit.
Hell, yeah, I've been
working out in there.
All you gotta do is work out.
Might be a good place for a fat
man to find his inner-self.
Yo.
I got some downtown suits wanna
hollar with you real quick.
Takin' me to see suits,
I'm tryin' to see some skirts.
So what do you do?
You should get dressed.
I got a lot of work here.
It's a long day for me tomorrow.
I'll be really quiet.
You never know, you might
get bored workin'.
I gotta work.
You gotta go...
What Stringer's done with
all that property downtown
Avon, I cannot tell the kind
of profit you're looking at
once all the federal
redevelopment money lands.
That whole howard street
thing is gonna take off
and you're gonna be right
there to cut the pie yourself.
Any dollar you spend now
is going to come back to you ten times.
And the thing is?
I know you don't wanna
go back to them streets.
Not after what you been through.
I know, because I'm from
those same streets.
And once I had the chance
to play a different game
there wasn't a question
in my mind how to go.
The government is going to be
looking at you hard, too.
No sense in giving them
what they're looking for.
You take what you have,
you build on it.
It's all good.
Just put it up on the calendar.
We should meet.
Yo, Slim.
You see the two niggas right there.
They over here gettin' high
in the middle of all this...
where the fucking
discipline at, yo?
Fuck, toss them niggers.
Talk to me for a second.
don't you know not
to stare at me like that.
Yo. I got to show you something.
Pardon me, sweetie.
Hey, yo, man.
You know I've been locked down.
You gonna love this.
Trust me.
Ah, shit, this ain't
my little place down in jessup.
But you know what I mean,
what the fuck is, right?
This is all you, B.
All you, in your name, too.
You know what I mean?
This piece of paper right
here makes it legit.
Keys to the navigator,
in the basement.
It's just a rental 'til
you pick out somethin' nice.
Damn, all this, huh?
You did good.
Yeah, I mean we're makin'
so much straight money, man
we can carry shit like this out
in the open, in our own names.
Yo, you remember when
we used to sit on the top
of 734 buildin', man?
Lookin' at the city,
talk about what we goin' do?
And you was all heavy into
that black pride bullshit
talkin' about you gonna
get you two grocery stores
make motherfuckers proud.
Sure was, man, you was out
huntin' on a ak-47.
Talkin' about
how I'm gonna get Warren.
Man...
We brothers, B.
Always, baby.
Always.
Hey, just one more thin', man.
I don't mean to be pickin'
with you about this but...
especially not after
you did all this shit for me
but, look, man,
I've been locked down.
You know what I mean?
You know what?
I got take this meet, you know?
I'm gonna get at you,
welcome home, man.
Hey, yo, it's me, man,
I left somethin'.
Aw, shit, my man.

<i>W.M.D. Got them W.M.D.</i>
You better move it on down.
It ain't pretty.
It doesn't have to be.
It just needs to pull them
from the places still worth salvaging.
Alright.
I told the other shifts
now I'm telling you:
When I ride my district
at the end of this week
I want to see empty corners.
They bring it here,
or the other two free-zones
or you bang them senseless.
Anything you need to do, you do.
Up to a body that can't walk
itself out of an emergency room
I'll back up you and your men.
You understand me?
Now,'ve detailed our I.I.D. representative
to the range for the entire week.
All citizen complaints will be handled
by Lieutenant Mello here.
Whatever it takes.
Man, I ain't even dirty.
I got rights an' shit.
Go with the one
about staying silent.
Shit like this
don't happen in Hamsterdam.
You gonna humble us
for just standin' somewhere?
Fuck y'all!
We in america.
West Baltimore.
I swear to god, officer Herc
you unhook babycakes
and my peoples be
down where you want us.
Swear to god.
Fuck with a man's ride,
you're gonna get his attention.
Babycakes?
Yo, yo, yo, hold up.
Motherfuckers gonna hear
from my motherfuckin' lawyer.
This right here
is some outrageous shit.
You think?
Fuck y'all lyin' motherfuckers.
Gentlemen.
That is outrageous.
Come on, sweetheart.
Bust your ass out of here.
Still Maryland.
But if y'all don't take that shit
down to Hamsterdam tomorrow
the next time
it's gonna be West Virginia.
That little star right there?
Across from the dipper?
That's north.
You wanna go the other way.
Assholes.
Homecoming
<i>Landfills, got Landfills. </i>
<i>W.M.D. Got that W.M.D.</i>
We'll start the interior
construction within the week.
Which means we need
to readdress the budget.
Readdress how?
Well, for one, the price
of steel has doubled.
It'll triple
if we don't buy it now.
- Ain't the steel bought already?
- Not the bulk of it, no.
And then there are the gutting costs.
They exceeded our original expectations.
He needs to wear
the hat when he's on-site.
Code, you know.
Gutting costs went up, huh?
That was due to your modifications.
The changes you asked for
in those loft units.
Necessitating new permits.
Which means another delay.
Unless we expedite.
Bring the architect and his
people back in over the weekend
and get something
to the city on monday.
Whoa, man, that part
of his original fee?
No, this was unanticipated.
Look, y'all fucked up,
so y'all supposed to take the hit, right?
Excuse me?
I mean, my man here don't know
shit about no gutting costs
he don't know nothing
about no price of no steel.
He just tryin'
to get some shit built
and y'all supposed to have
expertise behind this.
Only what I'm sayin' is
it seem like the expertise
ain't where it supposed to be.
Unfortunately, Mr. Barksdale
cost overruns are
the nature of the business.
We should discuss
this over lunch.
Ah, hell no, man,
I got elsewhere to be.
This is the Marlo kid.
He's fresh blood for the organization.
Bell's given him the best real estate.
The Barksdale people
took what they needed
when the towers
came down, no problem.
Stringer hasn't missed a step.
He's still selling drugs.
Lotta drugs.
He's not dropping bodies.
Nah, he doesn't need to.
He's got all the corners he needs.
And I'm supposed to give a shit?
Lieutenant, two weeks
Bell looked insulated
like he had enough legitimate front
to be able to be just the bank.
What Kima's found out is he's still
directly involved with the drugs.
Otherwise, why the face-to-face
with the Stanfield kid?
He's still connected
to the day-to-day.
We come back six, eight months
you won't even get him
in a room talking drugs
much less handling any.
It's now or never, Lieutenant.
Stringer Bell is quiet.
And if he's quiet
I don't give a fuck
if we come back a year from now
and find out he's on
the greater Baltimore committee.
This unit is about the bodies.
<i>Major Forrester, call two-four-six-two.
Major Forrester. </i>
What the fuck is this?
Ten-page report
on the heroic police work
undertaken to retrieve officer
Dozerman's service weapon.
Send that upstairs, keep the bosses
outta your ass for a while.
You actually did all this?
Would it matter if I had?
Jay
I'm a murder police
I got a double on my plate.
I'm gonna work it.
We ain't got Fayette
and Poppleton neither?
What the fuck?
I'm workin' on it, man.
The avenue corners, too.
What you mean
you workin' on it, man?
Why we ain't at least have
a shop setup down the block?
We did.
There was a setback.
Ran our boys off.
Who?
- Just some player, man.
- Listen.
Let him tell me.
We hire him for muscle.
The boy, Marlo.
Marlo, who the fuck is Marlo?
He tied into one of the mobs?
Young boy.
Runnin' it on his own, too.
Got maybe 15 spots
along here and the avenue.
An independent with
no fuckin' support?
Got all the prime real estate
and we doin' what exactly?
Young boy ran us
off the corner.
I'm losing
my motherfuckin' mind, man.
And I sincerely mean
your girl no disrespect but...
Tosha wasn't killed because
she just happened by that mess.
I think we all know that, right?
She was a player.
We know that much.
We got the science
that says she'd fired a gun
when it all went down.
Gun wasn't there for us to find
but that just means someone
grabbed it up, right?
I mean, your girl she, uh...
definitely had her say
when everybody else
on that street was talking.
Am I wrong?
Well, I got witnesses
on the scene that said
she was there right in
the middle of a drug robbery.
Boy by the name a' Omar
was in on it, too.
Nobody saying Tosha was an angel.
Nobody saying that.
But what are they saying?
The crew Tosha was runnin' with
maybe they didn't throw
the shot that killed her.
But if they don't come to me
early and tell the true story
I guarantee they won't
breathe a free breath
until them cicadas come back.
Y'all get the word
to the right people.
And you've spoken to
the medical examiner, correct?
What's he say?
He says it's lumpy.
Lumpy?
He says if an investigation
can come up with a credible scenario
he's willing to change
the cause of death to homicide.
Do you even have a suspect here?
Look, I don't know
how you city guys do it.
But down here in Annapolis,
we try to duck a punch or two.
Not lean into every last one.
My county doesn't
need another murder.
I'm glad you could came.
Ladies, Reverend Wright
I'd like you to meet
my husband, Cedric Daniels.
Nice to meet you.
Not that I've seen, no.
- She was invited, right?
- Oh, of course.
Eunetta doesn't make it
too much nowadays.
Not even council meetings.
I think Eunetta's gonna have her
hands full come the primary.
Mayor will pull her through.
He still have coattails?
Sheeeeet, boy.
You look up incumbent
in the damn dictionary
and you'll see Clarence
Royce smiling back at you.
He gets his whole ticket through.
Mayor's got a new poll
showing his negatives
they've really jumped
in the last year.
Not that he's gonna be putting
a press release out about that.
I hear you took a swipe
at Hizzoner the other day
on that witness murder.
Not at the mayor directly.
But we had the police brass in
front of the subcommittee and
I dunno, there's just
no excuse for what happened.
You keep on it, Councilman.
A little smack here and there
does this administration
a world of good.
That's why we need
new blood on the Council.
Keep everybody honest.
Don't embarrass yourself.
So...
your murder's never
gonna be a murder
and Daniels's got his head
all up in another case.
You know what the hardest part
of being a police is?
Yeah, explaining to your wife why
she has to take antibiotics
for your kidney infection.
I was gonna say trying to make
the job actually matter.
That too.
Speaking of your ex wife,
what's up there?
Nothing.
She's got her hooks in some lawyer.
Money guy.
Fuck it and fuck her.
So what, you movin' on?
Yeah, I might have some fresh
hope, now that you mention it.
Yeah, there's this woman
at this thing for my kids.
She, like, raises money
for the school and all that.
You know.
She's got a face, a body and
a brain all working together.
And she looks
like the kind who might
tell me when my shit stinks,
which is probably what I need.
She's kinda like Freamon with tits.
So what, you get her number?
No, not exactly.
Hey, what kinda detective
would I be if I couldn't
track a white woman
in Baltimore, right?
There you go.
You were so smooth tonight.
You had them eating
right out of your hand.
It's what you need from me, right?
Anyway, it wasn't too bad.
I'm getting better at it, I guess.
You are.
Cedric. Maybe we could...
I don't know.
Right now
you tell me where you need me
and whether you want the class
"a" or the class "b" uniform.
And I'm there.
More than that, I just don't know.
So.
So.
I'm sayin' what the fuck?
Take a deep breath, man.
I mean take a long deep breath
and know that if you call the shot,
we at war
we at war.
I'm there like I always been.
Thing about turf, man,
it ain't like it was.
I mean you ain't got to pay
no price of buying no corners.
Since when do we buy corners?
We take corners.
Man, you gonna buy
one way or another.
Whether it's the bodies that
we done lost or you gonna lose
time in the joint that's
behind us or ahead of us.
I mean, you gonna
get some shit in this game
but it ain't shit for free.
I mean how many
corners do we need?
How much money can a nigger make?
More than a nigger can spend.
And we ain't gonna be around
to spend what we done made already.
Shit, I didn't think I was
gonna be around this long.
Well, we here now.
The fact is we got
every mob in town:
Eastside, Westside,
ready to pull together
share territory on that good shit
that Prop Joe puttin' out there.
We take the shit downtown
and we get in the money game
that niggers ain't going to jail.
I mean, we past
that run and gun shit, man.
Like we fund us a package
and we ain't got to see
nothing but bank.
Nothing but cash.
No corners, no territory, nothing.
We make so much got-damn
straight money, man.
The government come after us, man
ain't shit they can say.
Businessmen, huh?
Let the younguns
worry about how to retail
we're the wholesale.
I mean, who gives a fuck
who's standing on what corner
if we're taking
that shit off the top
putting that shit to good use
makin' that shit work for us?
We could run more than corners, B.
Period.
We could do like
Little Willie, man
back in the day,
with all that number money.
And run this got-damn city.
Like businessmen.
Man, just lemme talk to the boy, Marlo,
see if I can't smooth this shit out.
I mean it ain't gonna be overnight
cuz the nigger already
knows what he knows.
But I think I could
talk some sense in his head.
Yeah, I ain't no suitman,
businessman, like you.
You know, I'm just
a gangster, I suppose.
And I want my corners.
<i>I've gotta tell ya</i>
<i>I'm having a tough time </i>
<i>wrapping my head around the
reality of you being paroled. </i>
<i>Trust me, I won't fully comprehend it
until I'm sipping my first martini. </i>
<i>Toby, I'm... </i>
Homide police
went to Tosha's people.
Talking about how
they know she was in the mix.
Sayin' they got witnesses an' shit.
They called your name on it, too.
- So what they say?
- They called me.
Hey, yo, I know this cop, man.
Maybe we should help him out.
Tell him who did what.
Yo, stop wallin', Kimmy.
A- ight, now I said I got this.
Tosha's people want to know from me
exactly what happened that day.
That's all I'm saying.
Well tell 'em she caught one tryin'
to take the boys down, man.
Ain't no need to involve
the police in none of this.
Sound to me like
he involved already.
Kimmy, I told you, I got this.
<i>Time!</i>
<i>Asshole. </i>
My husband worked for
Mr. Cooper at the american can.
He made good money.
We saved up and bought this house.
There were some white families
still living in the neighborhood then.
The neighborhood
has changed, Mrs. Hazel.
This is a picture of the house.
City owned, taxes paid and all.
It is very nice.
But I can't afford that.
You don't have
to worry about the money.
It's all taken care of.
This is a special program we have.
It's for people who are living
in really bad situations
with the drug trafficking
you see outside.
And this is a good neighborhood.
It's safe and it's on
the number 19 line.
And it's walkin'
distance from your church.
Officer, this is
the only home I know.
It's all I got.
Now you say you have a program
that can place me somewhere else.
But you ain't got no program
for what's outside my door?
You weren't lying.
I told you.
And I've been all over
these blocks like you said.
I haven't seen any cameras,
nobody peekin'.
And monk man
and his crew been here
for grindin' for days
and knockers ain't even blinked.
Tell you what.
Send my people over.
Not too many.
Just some of the younguns.
Keep the package real small,
in case it's a trap.
I'ma hear directly
from you on this.
I'm on it.
Shit is just bugged out, you know?
String called, said to tell you
he's gonna be late
behind something he needed
to see down the way.
So what you tellin' me we weak?
Boss, I reached out to Black Donnie.
Okay, spit it out, man.
Listen, stop fucking double talkin' me.
Black Donnie said
he ain't having any of it.
Said Brother Mouzone
put a hex on all of us.
What 'bout Peacock?
Peacock when a hired
out some dominicans.
What about Eggy Mule?
Eggy locked up.
Caught a nickel
with the feds for a pistol.
How 'bout Shorty Boyd?
Shorty Boyd went
and cleaned his whole ack' up.
Yeah, I know. Fucked us all up.
What we got?
Soldier you sent at us, Cutty,
he gonna work out
but the rest of them dudes,
I dunno.
A- ight, listen big man,
you about to earn your fuckin'
keep around here right now.
You go out, you get Cutty
and get the best of the rest
and put a hurtin' on Marlo.
I want my corners.
Fuck.
What now?
Problems, Mr. Bell.
Naw, this ain't
the time for problems, man.
I got places to be.
We're being told it
may take weeks before
we can get the city
inspectors back down
here to approve these site changes.
Weeks?
Every day we wait, you lose money.
What the fuck?
How does anybody make
any money in this game?
Every time I think we good,
y'all back in my pockets.
You need to make a call.
Again?
He's the consultant, right?
You're paying him a nice chunk
of change to consult, right?
This is why we have
a politically connected guy
like that on the payroll.
He goes downtown and does for us
what we can't do for ourselves.
Democracy in action, Mr. Bell.
A- ight, look.
Me and Slim, we gonna
work through the alleys
and hit 'em from this side.
I want you, to come through here.
Slow down.
Through the intersection.
Hold, why don't
we just come up this way
then we don't have to worry
'bout crossin' no intersection.
Come that way.
You puttin' your driver
in the line of fire, man.
Think on it.
He gettin' taken out.
Car gonna crash.
Now, where that put you at?
Besides you don't wanna be shooting
cross your driver, do you?
A- ight, so come in easy.
They ain't gonna be lookin' for you
'cause we gonna have their full attention.
Hey, look, pick your targets,
drop 'em and move out quick.
Who drivin'?
I'm under the wheel.
Alright, you make sure
you slow down
at the end of the block
and toss your weapons.
And get rid of any shell casings
that kick back in the car.
Poh-leece can trace them shits.
Toss the gloves too, right?
Naw, hold on to them.
They gonna have
that D.N.A. Shit all on 'em.
Alright, look, it's gonna
take us some time to get set up
soe need ya'll to lay back
'bout four, five blocks.
And when we ready, we're
gonna hit you on the burner.
Which y'all hold t'til I call you.
You got it?
We gonna handle our end.
You just make sure some fuckin'
way left out there for us.
'Cause I don't wanna feel
like I'm just someamn decoy.
Damn right about that.
It's just a relocate, no big deal.
I'm not asking for
round-the-clock protection
or anything like that.
No big deal?
Come on, Bunny, where the fuck
am I gonna find a house
for this old broad?
I got one already.
It's a foreclosure
up off the harford road.
All you gotta do is file
the emergency petition
my boys will move her in.
She's witnessing against
a violent drug crew.
Without her cooperation,
I doubt if it'll go forward.
She's 73 years old.
She's a brave old broad
to be doing this, I guess.
C'mon, Ray.
Look, we just lost
a witness in a drug case.
We don't wanna
lose another one so quick.
If Rawls gets wind of this,
you forged my signature.
Where's she living now, anyway?
She's on Vincent Street, sector two.
Bad location, huh?
You wouldn't believe it.
We should wait for the call.
Man, what if that
crew got lookouts?
Motherfucker, if we wait, it'll
be all over time we get there.
Plus, look I'm sayin'
how's that gonna play with Avon
they takin' all the credit.
Yo, fellas, strap up.
There go that
motherfucker Nay-Nay, man.
I say we take him.
We should wait for the call.
Man, we wait,
he gonna get away, man.
Go, go, go.
Get out, get out!
What the fuck.
Didn't I say something about waiting
for a fucking phone call.
You know how you blow-off
half the invitations
you get to be somewhere?
Ribbon cuttings,
playground clean-ups and shit?
I got to, no choice.
I was gonna cut out
on one the other day,
it was a fundraiser
for the delta phis, you know?
But I drag-ass over to the forum
to show the flag
and who's there in his ironsides
but Odell Watkins.
The rainmaker himself.
Yeah, talking in public about
being kinda disappointed
in the Mayor.
Disappointed, yeah?
Like how?
Like sincerely disappointed...
the way you'd be
with one of your kids.
Like he really wanted to see
the Mayor pressed, you know?
Got me thinking.
Maybe somebody can take a run
at Royce in next year's primary.
Like who?
Madame Council President?
Or Mickey Pepper
would give him a fight.
Mick's already said he doesn't
want to leave the legislature.
He won't risk it.
Well, you gotta
have someone with balls.
And somebody black.
This being Baltimore and all.
How many y'all take?
Two.
Didn't get nary a shot off.
Speak to the quality
of Barksdale's people.
He gonna have to come back at you.
You know it ain't gonna stop at this.
I don't want it to stop.
Barksdale weak today.
They ain't working
with the ammunition I got.
No doubt, you carryin'
a full clip.
But what you gonna do when you sittin'
at the head of the table?
Once you there,
you got to hold it down.
Sound like one
of them good problems.
Prisons and graveyards
full of boys who wore the crown.
Point is, they wore it.
It's my turn to wear it now.
We're gonna do this, right, Chris?
- We gonna do this, son.
- It's ready yesterday, dawg.
White t's, man?
Need to get yourself some white t's.
So you workin'
your plan, huh, Bubs?
Dollar here, dollar there, Kima.
So, what's up? Why you call?
Jus' checkin' in.
You still interested
in the boy Marlo, right?
No?
You wanna keep gettin' paid
you need to get your ass
up to park heights
school yourself on a jamaican
named Kintel got them corners.
Kintel, huh?
My bosses don't
give a fuck about Marlo.
Stringer's people neither.
That's too bad.
Yeah.
'Cause now we got
a whole lot of drama.
What happened?
That young buck, Marlo,
ain't gettin' runned off.
He jus' dropped two Barksdale
soldiers on the corner
of Mount and Fayette
a few hours past.
What?
Corners all jumpin' bad.
I thought Marlo
had them corners for Stringer.
- We saw them meet.
- I don't know what you saw
all I know is Marlo
is flying his own colors.
Westside about
to be all Baghdad an' shit.
But ya'll looking
for jake, what's his name?
Kintel?
Y'all too fickle for Bubs, man.
I swear.
A little gift for you and your boys.
Call me.
Whitey sale! Whitey sale!
Deputy, I am aware of the
incident and my men are on it.
We called in the seven-to-three
flex squad early
and my D.E.U. is canvassing.
<i>And what do we know?</i>
Only that it seems to be rival gangs.
What does homicide have?
<i>Fuck homicide. </i>
<i>I'm asking you
for answers right now, Major. </i>
Sir, my men..
<i>And you damn sure have none. </i>
My men are out there...
What do we know that we
can actually tell the man?
Like you said, rival gangs.
Which gangs?
Gangs.
Assholes who don't like each other.
I'm sorry, Major.
But we got nothin' on it.
Play it. It don't make me
no never mind.
It's all 'bout trumps.
Evenin', omar.
Evenin', Bruiser.
Speakin' 'of them trumps now.
Hey, everybody.
What's for dinner, Jen?
I'm starvin'.
It's working.
Hi, daddy.
How you doin', beautiful?
Daddy, we shared with you.
That's nice.
Hey, Jen, you seen that tape
I was watchin' last night?
I don't know
what you're talking about.
You gotta see this.
Videotape from last monday
night's council meeting.
Keiffer tried to block my resolution
but I laid him out good.
I was in rare form, baby.
- You seen that tape?
- Maybe you left it in the VCR.
What... sonofabitch.
Who the hell...
Daddy, Franky shared
his sammitch with you.
We hid it so no one else could
eat it before you came home.
Could I get some chips
and pickles with that too?
I don't want to disrespect you.
String been good to me, you know?
Not just my bills.
Him and Avon probably
think they owe me that much.
And it ain't what people might
be thinking or saying, either.
What they saying, honey?
It ain't like I don't miss Dee.
I do.
Yeah, well, I miss him too
but he's been gone a while now.
More than a year.
Stringer's fine
no denying that.
I feel safe around him.
You asking to get with String
I'm okay with that.
Thought you was gonna be mad.
I mean, everything with Dee
is so messed up, you know?
I mean, every time
I think about it...
and you know this one police
he came by here
and brought it all up again.
Who did?
Police detective from the city.
The one tried to turn Dee on Avon
when he got pulled up in Jersey.
White boy?
- Bushy hair?
- Yeah.
What he say?
What he say?
He said maybe D'Angelo didn't take
you know... take his own life.
He said maybe
it was something else.
And he came to you with it?
Left his card here one day
but I didn't say
nothing to the man.
Just told Stringer is all.
She's gonna run for Council?
She is.
Probably win, too, if I know her.
And you're the proud husband?
Not sure how that makes me feel.
It's just for show until
the election next year.
A city police lieutenant
looks good on her arm.
Who even cares anymore?
Half the country are separated
the other half are getting
divorced for the second time.
This is a favor.
For her.
It's hard to explain.
Look, I disappointed her.
She lived through me
for a lotta years
telling herself I was tracked
for deputy commissioner
at worst and past the police
department, who knows?
And there we were some things
that happened a long time ago
when I was in Eastern.
I guess she wanted more out of me
and after a lot of years
and a lot of plans
it turns out I have
a better head for police work
than I do for climbing the ladder.
She hung in there
thinking my career
was going to turn
into some kind of big deal
and I probably let her
believe it just to keep peace.
Now she wants
to be the big deal.
What do you want?
I just don't want
to disappoint her anymore
and right now
I'm more help showing up
at some chicken dinner
in my wedding ring and dress blues
then being the
not-even-divorced-yet husband
with the white woman on his arm.
I'm going to do what I can to see
she gets what she
wants this time around.
Nothing more than that.
Last seen Gerard, man
he was racin' bullets
up on Fayette Street.
He appeared to be winnin', too.
Look, man,
until he shows back up
we ain't gonna know
what happened out there.
I damn sure know one
fuckin' thing for sure.
Two our people are chalked
and we ain't got shit to show for it.
Man, police gonna
be real heavy on this, man.
I say we slow down.
Take our time
to build our muscle up...
No, I ain't got no more
motherfuckin' time, man!
When the word comes that this boy,
Marlo, punkin' me
what am I look like?
I'm gonna go do this
shit my damn self.
Naw, man, you just
this minute got home.
Your name come up
in a murder beef, man
they gonna pull your parole.
Let me take care of this.
We was thinkin', man,
me and Cutty, you know
so we could hit
back at 'em ourselves.
That way there
won't be no fuckups.
Look, you two
niggers get on it, man.
And get it right.
You see how shit
had to be handled, man.
The game is the fucking game.
Period.
Same as it ever was.
I dunno though, man.
I mean...
I mean...
I dunno, I was just down the way
with one of our younguns
on Vincent Street
where they got them
you know, empty houses over there.
And they got crews over there
twirlin' dope and coke like
the shit was candy.
Kids with a lemonade stand.
It's a different world down there.
Like the cops just standing
around like that shit was...
legal.
I mean, every day.
It actually was business.
What you sayin', man.
What's up?
Nothin', man.
Nothin' at all.
Our C.I. tells us those
are Stringer's people.
You want us to be about
the bodies, now we are.
We had this kid, Marlo
working for Stringer
but that might be wrong.
He might be going
to war for those corners.
Let me be clear:
This is no longer
about Stringer Bell.
Or Kintel fucking Williamson.
Or any of them.
What is my rank, Detective Greggs?
My rank!
Lieutenant, sir.
What is my rank,
Detective McNulty?
If you can't
remember that much
then you can go
the hell back to narcotics.
And you can go to whatever the
hell unit will still have you.
Now get the fuck out
of my office.
Your message said you'd be here.
Still, I kinda thought it'd be
one of your minions
showed up in the flesh.
You called on some
of my people's people.
I'm just workin'.
Doin' what a man is supposed to do.
Well, I know you been busy.
Caught some talk from the young men
you rousted over there on the Westside.
That was about a gun,
belonged to a police.
Yeah, caught some
talk about that, too.
This here's about something else.
Girl by the name of Tosha,
got her head blowed off in a firefight.
If you're not here to cooperate,
then why are you here?
Okay, I could just pull up
that other girl from your squad.
She ain't gonna talk to you.
Ain't nobody gonna talk to you.
I just came here
to make that clear, man.
Ain't no thing.
'Cause I already
got me an eyeball wit.
You do?
I dunno 'bout that.
Old Bruiser, he be blind behind
that fortified half the time.
Shit, you gonna have to dry him out
just to get him on the stand.
'Sides, he done had
a change o' heart to that story.
That's what I heard, anyway.
An' past that, you gonna have to call
this one of them
cost-of-doin'- business things
you all police be talkin'
about all the time.
Ya feel me?
No taxpayers.
Shit, way y'all lookin' at things
ain't no victim to even speak of.
Bullshit, boy. No victim?!
I just came from
Tosha's people, remember?
All this death,
you don't think that ripples out?
You don't even know what
the fuck I'm talkin' about.
I was a few years
ahead of you at Emondson.
But I know you remember
the neighborhood, how it was.
We had some bad boys for real.
Wasn't about guns
so much as knowin'
what to do with your hands.
Those boys could real rack it.
My father...
had me on the straight.
But like any young man
I wanted to be hard, too.
So I'd turn up at all the house parties
where the tough boys hung.
Shit, they knew
I wasn't one of them.
Them hardcases would
come up to me and say:
"go home, schoolboy,
you don't belong here. "
Didn't realize at the time
what they were doin' for me.
As rough as that
neighborhood could be
we had us a community.
Nobody, no victim,
who didn't matter.
And now all we got is bodies,
and predatory motherfuckers like you.
And out where that girl fell,
I saw kids actin' like Omar
callin' you by name.
Glorifyin' your ass.
Makes me sick, motherfucker,
how far we done fell.
25,000.
You don't need more
than that to get it done.
The fuck you say?
I'm just tellin' you how they do
down at zoning and permits.
They know you got
a general contractor
and his people out there
sittin' on their ass.
They know you payin'
twice that every week they sit.
25 gets me the permits?
20 gets you the permits.
Five is for me for bribin'
these downtown motherfuckers.
I mean, I'm the one
got to risk walkin' up
to these thievin' bitches
with cash in hand, right?
I'm telling you, String.
The people running
the city nowadays?
They make the last
bunch look sanctified.
I mean, this some shameful shit.
Permits come when?
Monday.
Latest.
<i>Spider bags!</i>
<i>Spider bags!</i>
Cutt, that's him.
Fruit.
Yo, I know that nigger, man.
Owe me money, actually.
She ain't say it like that.
She say it like she wanted
to get pregnant an' shit.
A- ight.
Damn, I opened up too early, man.
I stepped on your shot.
Come on, let's book.
Yo, there go
five-oh right there, yo.
Yeah, I know it's nothing.
The cops be lettin'
niggas grind down here.
It all... get the fuck out
of here little hoppers.
Get out of here, son.
Look at these little minis.
Hey, yo, what if he lock us up?
I hope y'all got toothbrushes?
'Cause down in boy's village,
you know what I'm sayin'
if you don't have no toothbrush,
you gonna be usin' some other boy's brush
or rubbin' your teeth
with your damn finger.
If you don't get locked up
y'all can keep an extra
20 each off the pack.
...got that fire, baby?
Come on, Tommy, give it up already.
Look, Terri,
you gotta do this for me.
Tell me why
you wanna be mayor.
Why should I vote
for you over Royce?
'Cause something is wrong in that city
and I think I can fix it.
This guy, he don't give a shit
about tackling the problems.
Crime is outta fucking control.
Last week, a kid witness
in a drug case turns up
shot dead because
of flaws in the system.
I go to the Mayor
who promises action.
And then, "mister reform-is-more-than-
- the-watchword-of-my-administration"
pats me on the ass,
thanks me for my concern
points me out the door. The end.
So, with crime as the issue
the great white father
rides to the rescue.
Against a black incumbent mayor,
in a city that's 65% black?
Black, white, green...
people are pissed off.
What makes you
think this is doable?
One, I hear the mayor's got problems
in his base and with key supporters.
Two, I got
the Police Commissioner
Royce's own man,
telling me all kinds of stuff
about his fucked-up department
and about Royce's inner circle.
And three, Tony Gray,
from the Fifth District
comes pretty close
to telling me he's thinking
about a run for mayor.
That'd split the black vote.
You'd still need a player
who gives the black
middle-class permission
to vote against one of their own.
You got one of those
in your pocket?
Not many of those around.
Elijah?
Congressional black caucus
ain't gonna save your skinny white ass.
What about Odell Watkins?
Well, it's funny you
should mention him
cuz I don't think he's too
happy with the Mayor right now.
I dunno.
I hear a new poll shows Royce's
negatives are pretty high.
You'd have to raise
a load of dough.
He has to see it.
I know he sees it.
It's past that now.
It's about us showing some respect.
Oh, fuck respect.
- He ain't right.
- No, he ain't.
But at this point
with you on the other
side of the argument
he'd rather be wrong.
Maybe if the word
came down from on high
it might change his mind.
I mean, if your friend Bunny Colvin's
up to his ass in bodies
then he'd take all
the help he can get.
Not that you'd ever
go behind anybody's back
or anything like that, right?
No way.
Two more murders yesterday
and another three today...
including a 14-year-old.
We're doing all we can.
You're at 260 for the year
and it's barely october.
You promised me 275 or under, Erv.
I had that as a promise.
Sir...
we see 300 before the new year
and I'm not sure that I can
justify a full term for you.
Now I hate to say it,
but there it is.
Barksdale's people and who?
Marlo Stanfield, the new kid,
we've been on him a couple weeks.
But Daniels' people
are up in the Northwest.
Your war's only
gonna get worse, Major.
The Northwest has been
quiet for weeks.
You willing to back door your
lieutenant like this, huh?
You ain't changed, Jimmy.
Shit.
It's always about your case.
You do what you can.
Keep my name out of it.
How it go?
We got one of the two
of the motherfuckers you know.
You mean, you motherfuckers
come strollin' in here
all walkin' tall and shit...
Yo, B, I, man, I'm sayin', man.
We were blazin' on them dudes.
Man, you know what I'm sayin',
just got in the heat, man.
We were blazin' though.
It was like...
Alright relax, man, I already heard.
Go sit down.
I'm not tweakin'
behind none of this.
That's one less motherfucker
that's breathin' than was yesterday
you know what I'm sayin',
so we all good.
But I'm surprised at you,
though, man.
Shit didn't get by you back when.
Wadn't my man's fault, man.
I unloaded on
the youngun too soon, man.
Gave him enough room
to buck and run, man.
I fucked that shit up
myself, you know...
Hold on.
It's on me.
I had that kid in my sights
close enough to take off his Kangol
and half his dome with it.
I couldn't squeeze the trigger.
Couldn't do it, man.
Why not?
Wadn't in me, I guess.
You know, whatever it is in you
that lets you flow like you flowin'
do that thing
it ain't in me no more.
A- ight.
So you done soldierin'
but you ain't done.
I could use you
for what you got in your head.
We're gonna put you on a corner,
you can be inside...
Aw, man.
I'm ain't makin' myself clear.
The game ain't in me no more.
None of it.
But you ain't done shit else.
You know what I'm sayin',
so what you gonna do?
I don't know.
But it can't be this.
A- ight then.
We straight.
See ya.
See ya.
B, he was a man
in his time, you know?
He a man today.
He a man.
Any idea what this is about?
Lieutenant.
Here he is, Bunny.
Cedric Daniels to the rescue.
Man of the hour.

All quiet today?
Keepin' it like that, boss.
We rule where we stand.
Police sittin' on all
the corners over these parts.
Likely because
we been droppin' bodies.
Yeah, they do like that.
But you know tomorrow
some other nigger stop a bullet
somewhere else and then they
go stand on a new spot.
Boy Marlo closed up shop.
Word is he wholesaling
his packages for now.
He ain't got no crews
out here at all?
How 'bout his avenue corners?
Nigger give up quick, didn't he?
Damn, I was just beginnin' to respect
the little motherfucker for showin' heart.
A- ight, listen.
When the police roll out,
y'all step in there an' take my corners.
I'm on it, B.
Cheesesteaks from Bill's.
Nah, I did that tuesday, man.
Fuck it then, you pick.
Naw, fuck me.
What?
Mope in the truck.
What about him?
I think I locked him up.
Avon whatshisface.
Big player from the projects.
He was the target on that detail
I worked a couple years back
the one I told you about.
Motherfucker's out already.
Why, what'd he pull?
Six, eight years.
Who the fuck can remember?
An' he's out in two?
Maybe I got the years wrong.
Point is guy's an asshole.
Locked him up is all.
Pit beef, from the market.
See? Now you thinkin' like police.
Back Burners
Change in plan.
Bell you recognize.
Second target is a Marlo Stanfield
who is apparently warring
with Bell for Westside corners.
What about Kintel Williamson?
That case is on hold for now.
On hold?
We just managed to I.D. the cell
phones on two of his people.
Be that as it may...
why not take
a few more weeks
and we can put together what
we got on Kintel, you know?
We send the case to grand jury
and then we start up this Westside case.
Otherwise, we wasted
more than two months...
change of target comes to us from
the Commissioner and the Deputy Ops.
The department is
in a reactive mode
trying to get the murder rate down
by any means necessary.
Kintel was dropping bodies
two months ago.
Today, it's the Westside
that's got the bosses spinning.
Look, I know y'all thought
it was nothin' for me to sit on that roof
day after 90-degree day,
dodgin' swarms of cicadas
and shit, but damn.
This is fucked up.
And all the assets
work I did on Kintel.
His cars, his cash flow...
I just put that in a drawer?
Some day I wanna work
for a real police department.
Just to see how the fuck
they do it, you know?
McNulty.
In my office.
Hey, Prez, can you
run something out for me?
What?
I need to know
who reed this room
in the downtown Hilton,
thursday before last.
Who rented the room?
Address, credit card details,
whatever you can pull.
How's it fit with the case?
Hard to say just yet.
Hey, my man.
I'm done mowin'.
So I figured I'd use this
to edge the weeds around the fence.
- It's gas-powered.
- Means I got to prime it.
You ain't got school me but once.
Get some water
before you go back out there.
You been goin' hard at it.
You keep showin' up at the spot,
I'll keep puttin' you on.
Good, 'cause I ain't
got nothin' else.
You walked back through
them old doors, didn't you?
Tried to.
I took you for gone.
Man, parole officers,
employment agencies...
shit, I just felt like I was
an interruption to their lunch break.
No family?
None besides my grandmother.
She put me up in the basement.
That's plenty to ask
of the old girl right there.
You could use someone to talk
to 'sides your grandmoms.
What about one of them
social worker types?
I hooked up with one dude.
He was cool, but I wasn't ready.
You look like you ready now.
I mean, you found an ear to bend,
you wouldn't have to talk to me.
Shit, I know you gonna get tired
of lookin' at my ugly-ass grill.
Drink that too fast,
you'll cramp up.
- You're asking?
- I am.
Lieutenant, I didn't...
Because I got no problem
changing targets
if that's what the bosses
tell me to do.
Unless it's personal.
Like when Kima got shot...
I don't care where
we spend our time and money.
Bell, Williamson, whoever.
It's all just police work to me.
And I understand that people
above my pay-grade have the right
to make decisions
that are theirs to make.
And if they're wrong?
Then they're wrong
and time will tell, won't it?
Now, I'm asking you for the truth.
You went to Colvin. Behind my back.
I'da gone to the devil himself.
Which way you were standing,
Lieutenant
had not a fucking
thing to do with it.
You piece of shit.
I did it because it had to be done
just like it had to be
done two years ago
when we were first detailed.
Stringer was the target then,
he's still the target now.
Lieutenant, you know,
as bosses go
you're better than most
and I know you went out of your
way to get me off that boat.
I know that.
But now we're back
on the right man.
Detective McNulty.
When the cuffs go on Stringer,
you need to find a new home.
You're done in this unit.
Count right?
Yeah, went almost to Richmond
for this here batch.
Yeah, I'm holdin'...
- You did like we say, right?
- Yeah.
Give him that.
We're gonna need another
60 more in a couple days.
60 more?!
You know how we do.
So don't be cryin', Bernard.
You musta left something out.
Fuck no. I got the part ones
from every sector, every post.
We're down about two percent.
Now where exactly are we down?
Larcenies and burglaries are steady
but shootings and agg
assaults are both down.
Drug arrests, too, but I guess
that won't look so good.
I mean, where geographically
are we down?
In the district?
Well, the posts near the
designated drug zones are up
almost all of them.
That ain't pretty.
But everywhere else is down.
In some places
as much as four percent.
Bosses are gonna love you.
It's too soon to take any credit.
This might be, whatcha call that
statistical aberration.
You ain't gonna let them know
that your little experiment
might be working?
Not yet, no.
But I'll tell you
what we are gonna do:
Starting next week
I want you to pull one car
out of service on
the quiet posts in every sector,
all three shifts.
We'll take those nine guys
gonna use 'em and double up
on the high-crime posts.
If we handle less of it
we ought to do better with
the crime we've got, right?
Can I get two
Trac disposable phones.
They on special. Four for 180?
Just the two.
Last show out at Westview is 8:45.
We could make that if we don't
make the whole damn run today.
Seem to me one phone
is as good as the next.
Only a fool drive all over the
world when there ain't no need.
Keep on with that shit an' I'ma
leave your ass in Baltimore.
I don't trust no man
on the road by hisself, okay?
I'm not stupid.
Stupid ass fucker.
Commissioner!
How goes it?
It went a lot better before
the Mayor's cabinet meeting
I can tell you that.
He rip you?
Says we need to finish under 300
for this year regardless of how it happens.
- I tried to tell...
- Erv, lemme ask you...
where do you guys stand on this
witness assistance thing?
What?
Overhauling the city's
witness assistance program?
Nobody from the Mayor's office
called you regarding
this problem of witnesses
getting killed?
I got a call from the chief
of staff a week ago, yeah.
But all he said was
I should try not to have
any more witnesses get killed.
But overhauling the program?
Unless someone wants
to spend a lot more money
there's not a whole
helluva lot my people can do.
And you haven't talked
to the Mayor directly on this?
You're not gonna fuck me on this?
As it is, I got
the Mayor's teeth in my ass.
Your name does not get mentioned.
Mayor didn't say a word to me.
Thanks.
Where the fuck we at now!?
Just buy four or five, Bernard.
Do it like that
and it'll go twice as quick.
I want a Shrek Slurpee, Bernard.
And some Krispee Kreme.
All this from one disposable
cell phone?
And a dead one, too.
It was used by Marlo's people
and picked up off the ground by Kima's C.I.
Problem is it's just raw data.
We need to firm up what we know
about Marlo's operation
with surveillance and C.I. info.
On the other hand
if we had a burner
that we knew was used
by one of Stringer's players...
we could use what we know
about that origination to make
all kinds of connections.
Get us one good phone,
we'll give you the network.
That's the good news.
What's the bad?
It's all historical.
We can give you
the network no problem
but by then it's a week old
and they've dumped their phones.
And how we get a wire up on that...
I haven't figured out yet.
Well, see that you do, detective.
Oh, yeah. You keep this job.
I'ma gain some serious weight.
- Just the two?
- Just the two.
Nigga, you ain't never
hearda buyin' in bulk?
You could be savin'
them people all kinda money.
Or better still, spendin' it on me.
Why you got a gun, Bernard?
You ain't heard?
Avon's home, so we toolin' up.
You ain't the only one on parole.
Girl, you ridin'
my last good nerve.
That's not the only thing
I can ride.
Just get me back to the Interstate?
<i>Big white bag,
got the big white bag!</i>
Which one is he, again?
Broadus, street name of Bodie.
He used to bein the low-rises.
Had a tower later on.
<i>Big white,
got the big white!</i>
How many more minutes you think
he's got on that phone?
Fuck this, let's hit the bar.
Lester needs a phone, man.
There's an easier way.
I'll show you tomorrow.
C'mon.
<i>Got the big white. </i>
I'm buying.
<i>Big white bag,
got the big white bag!</i>
She just wants
me to be happy, you know?
An' I mean, I do the same for her,
when I can.
Like this thing
with the police detective?
Brianna says she wants me
to go downtown with her, and...
I dunno,
hear the man out about Dee...
and I know there ain't nothing to it,
but she's all upset you know.
And I tried to tell her
what you told me
but she says she wants to go down there
and talk to him herself I guess.
You told her about the cop?
What?
About the detective.
What you told me, you told her?
It's her son, right?
I mean, she got a right
to know what's goin' on.
- Look, I just thought...
- What?!
Why the fuck you gonna get her
all upset over some bullshit?
Here we are, fuckin' year later,
everybody forgot about the shit
you go runnin' your
mouth about nothin' at all.
But, String...
What, an' she gonna
believe that shit, too.
What mom is not gonna believe
her son didn't kill hisself?
String...
How she gonna take to that shit,
go half-crazy with it.
- I just...
- You just what?
Sorry.
When you tell her that?
'Bout a week ago, I guess.
When she gonna go see the cop?
Think she gonna
talk to a lawyer first.
- Ask him how to play it.
- Who Levy?
I guess, whoever.
- The lawyer.
- Levy?
- I guess.
- Oh, you didn't ask that?
And this fucking Royce
just lets it slide.
I mean, I go to him, right?
Not to make points,
just to do the right thing
what does he do
but blow smoke up my ass.
"I'm glad you came
to us with this, Tommy... "
"Oh, I'll light a fire, don't you worry.
We gotta move on this. "
I never thought he'd have the balls
to just fuck the dog on it.
And you were doing the right thing.
Fuck yeah.
What?
You went there hoping
that Royce would disappoint.
You want to know that you're better,
that you deserve his chair.
If I lie down on this couch,
do you charge by the hour?
Thanks.
You're not naive.
Neither am I.
A man doesn't run for office
without being a bit self-righteous first.
Self-righteous?
Me?
So what are you gonna do now?
Call a reporter or two,
rip the Mayor.
Maybe on background,
maybe go on the record. I dunno.
Rip him now?
With the primary next september?
Tommy, no one's gonna remember
a dead witness a year from now?
Better if you go to Royce
confront him, not angrily
give him a chance to explain.
Or maybe take action.
If he does do something,
then a problem got fixed
and you can feel
special for helping.
If he doesn't, you sit tight.
I don't know.
Maybe you document
your meeting in a letter
expressing your concern and regret.
Then you're set
if the next witness gets killed.
Win-win.
Unless you're the witness.
I know, you're right.
But he's taking
on a two-term incumbent.
It's all gonna be ugly from here.
Yeah, it's cool.
Need another 30 by monday, a-ight.
A- ight.
Bitch, everything I say
you hear backwards.
Stupid little fucker.
Got them tees, bright white!
One for three, two for five.
<i>Blue Tops, got them Blue Tops!</i>
I got them tees.
Bright white,
one for three, two for five.
I got this, man, five dollar.
- New.
- No thank you, man.
- It's only five dollars.
- No thank you.
Fuck you, man, fuck you.
Fuck you.
I got them, uh...
I got them tees.
<i>Red Tops, Red Tops,
got them Red Tops!</i>
<i>Rockefeller,
got them Rockefeller here!</i>
Hey, seller man, what you got?
Got the long white tees
for the young ones.
You ain't got candles?
I'm lookin' to buy candles.
And toilet paper
for the shitbucket, too.
You be back here tomorrow?
I can't leave.
I leave, somebody grab my stake.
I'll be back tomorrow.
Yo, Johnny.
Was' up, Bubs.
Shit, Johnny, man.
Just been chasin'
that pipe, you know.
Shit got me all diggin'
and scratchin' in my arms.
You know, it's cool.
Alright, come on, man,
you need a break. Alright?
I'm serious, you need a break.
Come on, man.
Naw, man, look around you.
Soldier's paradise, man.
I'm a viking, Bubs.
You a viking?
Fuck, not again.
You two coming?
Major said to get 'em down here
he didn't say shit
'bout playin' nursemaid
to a bunch of goddamn animals.
Watch your back, watch your back.
Watch your back.
Should we cuff 'em, sarge?
Naw, cut 'em loose.
The fuck we tell you about
fighting down here?
Only rule is no fighting,
no cutting, no shooting!
An' y'all still fuck it up.
Next time you make me come down here,
see if I don't call for a ten-thirty-eight.
So you know, dickhead,
that's an ambulance.
Break it up,
break it up, break it up.
Did I wake the baby?
You would know if you did.
It's 3:00 in the morning.
Nice of you to check in.
I went out after work to unwind.
Yeah, you look unwound.
Well...
I figured you had everything
under control on the homefront.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
What's with the sarcasm?
How come you can talk
to everybody else but me?
You really want to know?
I'm listening.
I miss us.
Do not blame that baby.
Do not do it.
I'm not blamin' anybody.
I didn't do this by myself.
We discussed it, all of it.
We talked about it, yeah.
But...
I didn't have as much
to say about it as you.
And why not?
Because you...
you wanted this.
I didn't want
to disappoint you on it.
I don't think I could be more
disappointed than I am right now.
You need to go.
Quiet overnight?
Midnight shift had to toss a crew
that was casing the place.
But other than that...
Too many damn children.
Whaddaya need lookouts and runners for
if the shit is legal?
A lot of them have been cut
loose by the dealers.
It's like one of those nature shows
where you mess
with the environment
some species gets
fucked out of their habitat.
Did you just use the word
habitat in a sentence?
I did.
You let your lookouts go?
My runners, too.
Shit, what's the point?
So here you are
making money hand over fist
and you're too damn greedy
to take care of your work force.
I don't need 'em.
But they need you, right?
You was all they had
when you couldn't work a corner
except for touts and runners
then it was cool to have them
cut school and work out.
Okay, new tax initiative,
my brother.
Say what?
If you wanna sling
in Hamsterdam after today
you an' every other knucklehead
you each gotta kick in a hunnert a week.
Oh, so you tryin' to get paid, huh.
Not me, not for me.
Get the cash up, I'll be back.
But it ain't something I'm gonna
go to jail for, right?
I mean, it ain't nothing
like that is it?
That one?
No, it was more black than silver.
This one, I think.
I can see y'all got some real
ugly shit planned for me.
I can see it.
You just bumped up against
a clever police is all.
Course he's gonna try
to shame you with the dead girl
or some mess about children lookin' up
to Omar an' his sawed-off.
All he can do
especially since you backed down
what he had for a witness.
He workin' you with guilt, boy.
Yeah, but that fat man gave me
an itch I can't scratch, Butchie.
Everybody in this world does
what they gonna do.
Me, you, that police.
Everybody in this world
got their own place.
An' a man in your line of work
start worryin' about how other
people see you
playin' the other people,
instead of to hisself, he gonna get dead.
I still feel like
I owe somethin', Butch.
I had an uncle down Carolina,
he dead now
but I remember he was
grieving real hard
real hard over chasin'
his lady friend away.
So he put himself to punishment.
Took a knife to his little finger
then his ring finger.
With them all bloody on
the table, he pulled up short.
For the rest of his life
I remember him sayin' the bitch
weren't worth more than a pinkie.
But it was too late then.
You can try that
if you have a mind.
I dunno, Butchie.
A little somethin' less dramatical.
Ya feel me?
You told Brianna she could go
downtown with this?
D'Angelo's her son,
how was I gonna stop her?
Look, look there's no harm done
if she just keeps
her mouth shut and just listens.
Naw, naw.
It's fucked up.
There ain't no call messin'
with Brianna with this bullshit.
What can you do?
I dunno.
File a kinda complaint against
the detective or some shit. I dunno.
Harassment?
This the same motherfucker
that had Avon's case.
Same motherfucker that's comin' at me
in my print shop talkin' shit.
An' now he's comin' up
at Brianna with this bullshit?
A complaint's
not going to do anything.
And the fact is
if the cops are saying
her son might not be a suicide
Brianna's gonna
hear this out regardless.
I suppose Avon
should know about it, though.
Yeah, well, I'll handle that.
Not much slinging going on here.
Western boys are sittin'
on the real estate.
Yeah... a-ight, a-ight.
That'll work, too.
A- ight.
Yo, Shamrock says we should
take some of our people down
to Hamsterdam and sell off there.
At least until these knockos
roll up off some of these corners.
C'mon.
Car stop, maybe?
Why not?
Not yet, you fuckin' rodent.
You all can't do this, man.
We headin' to Hamsterdam.
You come off that car again
an' you goin' to Bon Secours
emergency room. You hear me?
Yo, officer,
we got immunity from y'all.
We goin' to the free zone.
What the fuck's the free zone?
Ho shit.
Packaged for sale.
Hey, straight up.
Why you think we headed
there in the first place?
Headed where?
Hamsterdam.
Suck my dick!
Hey, y'all wanna see a wagon!
Fuck y'all!
You just shut the fuck up
and cut this shit out now!
Like you said.
That's your receipt.
Two-forty-four for
the hoop comes back to me
rounding to two
and a half for my gas money.
This repays me.
The rest of this?
Use it to pay
them hoppers for the week.
Whether you use 'em or not,
you pay this money out.
Shit is like
unemployment insurance.
Every employer got to pay in.
And if I find out anybody holding out
he's out of here and back on the street
gettin' his head busted.
Least y'all can do is look after
your own people a little bit.
What are you a fuckin' communist?
<i>23 o' four. Need a couple of 10-16s,
to Fayette west of Vincent. </i>
That's right around
the corner from here.
<i>Ten-four, units responding. </i>
The fuck happened?
Car stop.
I got a g-pack from beneath
the passenger seat.
Yo, we was on our way to Hamsterdam
an' the man say we don't get hassled
comin' in or goin' out.
Was' up?
What the fuck is Hamsterdam?
<i>Lyin' ass poh-leece!</i>
I can't let you do this.
Carv, they got a g-pack.
On the way to the free zone, they did.
You know the rules.
Yeah, man, and I was tryin'
to tell these people...
Shut the fuck up.
<i>700 to any unit at the scene
at Fayette and Vincent. </i>
Yeah, boss.
<i>You got a situation there?</i>
I can't believe this bullshit.
Yeah, bullshit is right.
I told you to shut the fuck up.
Yo, man, y'all gave your fuckin' word.
You know you did, man.
This is so fuckin' bullshit.
Y'all some fuckin' liar'y man.
Carv, will you please tell me
what the fuck is going on here?
Major said he's on his way.
Carv?
Oh, man.
Sure that's the one?
Reesie say that was the one.
Who am I to say different.
Tell him I ain't gonna pay
'til it proves itself though.
I told him that already.
He say 1500 for his trouble.
Damn.
Conscience do cost.
I seen him, Bernard.
You hadn't even gone past the damn door
and he threw all the papers in the trash.
You lyin' now, I can tell.
You is the only one
who gives a fuck.
An' if you hadn't been
the stupidest mothercker
that I ever gone out with,
you'd just would have bought
a whole bunchaf them
things at once.
Only need like six more.
We be done in, like, half an hour.
How 'bout we make one more
stop you get six of them shits
and I suck your dick
for the next 20 minutes.
Gotcha.
Fuck.
Fuck y'all.
Shit. I worked a double, man.
<i>Bunk, line three. </i>
Detective Moreland.
Heard you lookin' for something.
Lemme get some of them
Trac phones activated.
Eight of 'em bitches.
This one for sector two.
Sector one, I'm using the empty
low-rise housing on Winchester.
Sector three, the old Koppers plant.
And it's legal to sell here?
It's not legal.
We just look the other way is all.
How? How can you?
I know it hurts your heads
to think about it
but before you decide
to lose your minds on this
take a moment, ride around to my corners,
my worst drug corners.
Edmondson and Brice.
North and Pulaski. Hollins and Payson.
They're empty.
All of them.
District-wide, my crime
is down five percent.
But do the bosses know?
No, the bosses
don't know shit about it.
This is just a district commander,
taking an initiative on his own.
Jesus christ!
I knew it was only a matter
of time before I bumped into
somebody from downtown about this.
And I know your natural
impulse is to take what you saw
back downtown with you,
but I gotta ask you...
You legalized drugs?
Look, this is a tactical deployment.
We just wait for everything
to get settled down here
in these three zones
and then we move.
Look, we make a big show
of lockin' everybody up
and then we shut it down.
I'm sorry I had to
fuck you up on that arrest
and I'm sorry you had to see us
give that runt back the g-pack.
That was ugly, I know.
But I'm just tryin' to save
what's left of my district
anyway I can, if I can.
And the longer I have before
I have to brief the bosses
about this deployment...
We got all we needed
from the car stop, major.
Don't sweat it.
Let me get a word
with my old commander.
I dunno, Major.
Whenever you bust this place up,
they'll go back to their same corners.
Besides, you were never
much on making a big show.
If this doesn't work, Jimmy,
we're back to the usual
and I'm out the door
on a pension anyway.
But, Jimmy, I need more time.
I need to be able to rely on you
and your people to keep this close.
The bosses don't know, huh?
Fuck the bosses.
You the man who called?
I did.
You witnessin' or what?
I'm afraid I'm blind.
Legally.
Something you need to see though.
Glock 40, I believe.
I suppose you ain't going to tell me
who brought this here, right?
Like I say
I'm blind.
I thought you might know, though.
You tell him for me
I'm hopin' he might need
this in court some day.
Knockos might come back.
They might.
But until they do,
this your corner to hold.
What about Marlo's crew?
Look, Avon's home,
and you on a Barksdale corner.
Ya feel me?
Avon ain't here now.
You got muscle.
Don't worry about that, little man.
Hey...
the burner of young Bodie Broadus
it still has minutes left.
Speed dial?
Caroline.
You wouldn't have an extra room
at your place, would you?
Jus' for a night or two,
'til I can get my shit together.
Ain't no fixin' it?
It's fixed pretty good, I think.
Thanks.
Credit card was a business account
listed to a Theresa D'Agostino.
Yeah, that's her.
What kinda business?
Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee.
Billing on the card goes
to a business address
in northwest Washington.
I called the switchboard
and she's listed.
D'Agostino doesn't sound much
like a west Baltimore name to me.
Me either.
Truth is, I don't know what I want.
I'm know I'm lookin' for somethin'
but I can't even
tell you what it is.
I understand you found work.
Ain't no payroll job, but it'll do.
You ain't here for a job.
Or the G.E.D. program.
So you lookin' to join the church?
I, um...
I just...
I've had this feelin'
for a long time
and it's like
I'm standing outside myself
watching me do things
I don't wanna do, you know?
Jus' seein' me like
I'm somebody else
but never ever bein' able
to stop the show.
I'm tired.
It's Cutty, right?
Naw, man.
Dennis.
She's left, huh?
I figured that because, ah,
I'm supposed to meet her actually.
Tonight, yeah...
right, exactly.
I was going to pick her up
and take her to that
but I'm running late...
Yeah, yeah, I know...
Where is that exactly?
I'm not really familiar
with that part of...
Too many damn scheduling
conflicts, unfortunately.
But we have put it
on the agenda for the next meeting
of the coordinating council
on criminal justice.
You're sentencing it to committee?
Mr. Mayor, we're probably only talking,
like, a few hundred thousand to start.
I'm not saying we should create
new identities for these people
and send 'em to New
Mexico like the feds.
We just need to get them
out of harm's way.
Lemme tell you something,
Councilman.
I can't lay my hands on several
hundred thousand dollars
that is not already spoken for.
- Mr. Mayor, I was not...
- What would you have me do, Councilman?
Should I divert the money
that's already been budgeted
for snow removal from
the first district this winter?
How 'bout I reduce trash pickup
to once a week citywide
put the witnesses up
at the Hyatt Inner Harbor?
I'm not trying to be difficult,
Tommy. Come on...
the city in the
financial situation it's in
very few friends in Annapolis
we've done all we can do
with this matter for now.
Okay, then.
Thanks for your time.
Gentlemen.
Nah, what the fuck.
I dunno, boss. If there weren't
so many fucking kids down here
I might be okay with it.
Baltimore police.
Baltimore?
Baltimore, Maryland.
Can I get a Jameson's?
Bushmills, okay?
That's protestant whiskey.
The price is right, ain't it?
Make it neat.
Excuse me.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
I was just asking myself
the same thing.
You drive all the way
down here to look at me
from across the room and then leave?
That's kinda creepy.
You looked occupied.
Him?
Honey, that's just business.
This ain't my kind of crowd.
Definitely not.
Yeah, well, I made a mistake,
so I'm gonna go.
Four-twenty-eight.
You live in this town.
Why book the room?
I live across town.
As late as these things go,
that's a D.U.I. away.
Give me two hours, McNulty.
What am I gonna do for two hours?
Dream on it.
Water's fresh?
You keepin' them cool?
You got squeakers nestin' squabs.
Takin' care of the younguns,
I like seein' that.
Yeah, Marlo, he's real loyal.
You can't kick him off that nest.
Good work.
That's really good work.
Police comin' off them corners.
I seen.
I'm gonna keep my name off
the package for a time
keep wholesalin'.
You know, step back a bit.
Barksdale gonna think we weak
not comin' out
to claim what's ours.
The police leave them corners,
he's gonna be back out there.
I know he will.
Your turn, girl.
It's a bout time.
For real.
For starters
its memory holds the last 10 calls
made and received by the user.
That's enough
to give us a signature.
Signature?
The phone numbers
unique to an individual.
That way we can identify the user
when he switches to another phone.
Sorry, I'm late.
Woke up in the wrong town.
Anyway, we ran the tolls
on those numbers
and we came up with
a rather interesting pattern.
Check this out.
This is the pattern of a clod
communication network.
Something you would expect
from a drug organization.
This particular one so far
involves 15 distinct burners.
15.
And none of them list
subscriber information.
You can do that?
With these burners,
with this particular company
you don't need
subscriber information.
Our data shows that over 92% of the calls
are made within this network
with the average call
lasting less than a minute.
Again, suggestive
of drug trafficking.
This user here,
he serves as a clearing house.
He receives calls,
and initiates interactions.
He coordinates the show.
Be nice if that was Stringer.
Now this is the best part,
this is something that Prez discovered
when he was playing with it.
It has a speed dial feature.
Meaning, someone took
the time to program the phone.
Hell, that's probably
the only way these corner boys
can remember all the numbers
what with these phones being
dumped every few days or so.
I'll bet all the other phones
in the network are set up the same way.
Well I've heard enough.
We should start writing for the wire.
When can we get up?
Get up on what?
They're dumping phones
every couple weeks on average.
By the time you get a wire up
on that, the phones are dead.
The whole network
shuts down simultaneously.
Do we have a plan?
Not yet we don't.
But for now, if I could get a couple more
of these dead phones
it'll probably help corroborate
the theory for the affidavit.
Kima, maybe you could ask
those western boys to pick up
what they find on the ground
for the next few days.
Yeah, sure.
Damn boy, you smell like sex.
You didn't take a fucking shower?
Late for work.
You forgot my Newports,
didn't you?
Aw shit, man. I did, yo.
Lemme do up these chips
an' then I'll go get your cigs.
Fuck.
<i>Three one, shooting
at the number one Mayo. </i>
<i>We're gonna need
some suits down here. </i>
<i>For investigation? I'm on my way. </i>
<i>Roger, 10 hundred. </i>
Back so soon.
I thought you guys had enough
of our happy district yesterday.
Just need a favor.
Lester wants you to scoop up
any discarded cell phones
you find on Barksdale corners.
You want Barksdale license plates.
- Tag numbers and all?
- Whatever, sure.
'Cause I saw the big man
riding in a truck the other day.
Missed the tag,
but if I see him again...
Stringer?
- Naw, the other guy.
- What other guy?
Big boy, the one we locked up.
- Avon.
- Avon Barksdale?
Jesus, Herc. He's at Jessup,
down for four or five at least.
What, we all look alike to you?
If you don't believe me fuck it.
No fuckin' way...
but the fact remains
we would not be returning
this service weapon to this officer
without help from the citizens
of Baltimore as well.
And on that note, I think our Mayor
would like to say a few words.
Thank you, Commissioner Burrell.
I just want to take this opportunity
to commend our department
on successfully resolving this case
and to wish officer Dozerman
a speedy return to duty.
<i>Officer Dozerman</i>
<i>the citizens want you
to have this back</i>
<i>and to thank you for your
service in defense of our city. </i>
<i>and I especially want to thank all
of our concerned residents</i>
<i>who called into the hotline.
We would not be here today... </i>
Lester.
Lieutenant, you gotta see this.
Big joke.

<i>Redi-sons, two for one. </i>
Anything up?
Just a good package.
Three O.D.'s
last one didn't look too good
before by the ambo came, neither.
There's more inside, Carv.
Gah-damn!
Can't yoever get a fucking poh-lice
'round here when you need one?!
Moral Midgetry
Okay, on that burner?
I called Trac,
gave 'em the serial number.
Trac Corporation tells me
that they sent it to Northland
a purchasing corporation.
Northland tells me they sent it
to their distribution center in Hagerstown.
Hagerstown tells me they sent it
to buddy's Mondo Mart
at one-four-four-o Propane Road,
Falls Church, Virginia
that's where it went out
into the street.
What?
Did buddy have them on display to the left
or the right of the cash register?
How would I know that?
Alright.
As for the numbers
in the phone's speed dial
we got one local number
one number that tracks
to Bodie's grandmother's house
on West Baltimore Street
and six others numbers
that are all assigned
to Trac disposable cell phones.
And those phones were
all purchased outside the city.
One each in Catonsville,
Laurel, Bethesda
and stores in Virginia,
at Springfield, Dumfries and Lakeside.
Everything is along I-95, from
here to almost Richmond.
They're driving 200 miles
every couple of weeks
out of sheer caution.
It's beautiful.
What is?
The discipline of it.
In your life, did you think you
would ever again see
Mount and Fayette like this?
Those ain't touts,
ya hearing, brother.
Those are birds chirpin'.
How?
I'll show you.
You say no whistles,
no muscle, no flexin'.
You supposed to be
all over that shit, man.
You even said it's supposed
to be like the valley of eden.
To serve, and protect,
motherfuckers.
- Call it poetic injustice.
- I want to file a report.
- Say what?
- You heard me.
You want to make
a complaint to us
that you were selling drugs
and someone took your money?
Fuck yes.
Fredericksburg?
They're going all
that way to buy cell phones?
One here, two there.
No wholesale purchases.
They're dumping phones
every two weeks or so
and still they're worried
about catching a wiretap.
Just 'cause you're paranoid doesn't
mean someone's not out to get you.
Right?
Be nice to know who's buying
all those cell phones, though.
Oh, God.
Yo, yo, yo, yo. You up, ol' man?
They do have a point though, right?
I mean, we tell 'em to comedown
here without the guns
and then we fall down
on providing protection.
It's like the stickup crews
have these hoppers feelin'
like they live in a lamb pen.
They see one more gun?
Gandhi-world falls apart,
this I guarantee.
So what are you doing about it?
I sent a few of the vics
over to the district with Herc.
Let 'em play with an ident-a-kit,
but you know how that goes.
But can I be honest?
It's not just the wolves
circling the corral.
We got 50, 60 kids on the inside
been fight or flight since they
popped out of the chute
and right now they're just
thumb-up-their-ass hangin'.
All these ex-runners, ex-lookouts.
That shit worries me as much
as any carnivores out there.
If you want to neutralize a threat?
Give it a job.
As?
Auxiliary cops.
Keep an eye out for the predators.
You got the dealers payin' 'em
to do nothing now anyway?
Kill two birds and all that.
Right.
Throw 'em some bikes,
maybe police radios.
We could do that.
I was being...
you're serious?
What in God's name did you do here?
<i>W.M.D. Got them W.M.D.'s</i>
Hey, how you doing?
We're looking for a guy
who came in here
10, 11 days ago, dropped cash on
a couple of disposable phones?
10, 11 days ago?
Yeah. Black, most likely.
That really narrows it down.
How about we just check
on some of your security tapes?
From 10 days ago?
Unless there's an incident.
We re-use those video tapes every week.
Every week?
It's Mondo Mart policy.
That went well.
Yeah?
<i>Brianna Barksdale called for you. </i>
Who?
<i>D'angelo Barksdale's mother. </i>
You get her number?
<i>You got a pen?</i>
<i>Four-one-oh, seven-one-eight,
nine-four-apple-three. Got it?</i>
Alright.
<i>You gonna call her?</i>
I dunno...
- <i>It's all yours. </i>
- Thanks, Jay.
Hey, check it out.
Mondo Mart, Mondo Mart,
Mondo Mart, Mondo Mart.
We're fucked. Until we get here...
Baba Jani Food Mart,
Dumfries, Virginia.
We're gonna go 100 miles
on the off-chance this guy
has a memory or a camera?
Do you really wanna go home early
and disappoint Lester Freamon?
Who was that who rang?
Guess who's calling homicide
looking for me on D'Angelo Barksdale?
His mama.
Yeah?
Shit, I forgot I'd even tried
to press that thing
and now she's
calling up asking questions.
Waste of her time as it was mine.
Kinda like this road trip.
He do look natural.
This motherfucker Marlo?
We gonna have to get
deep on this nigger.
I mean it feels like
ain't shit change
except for a growing
lightness in my wallet.
Where's my letter of approval, man,
from the preservation motherfuckers?
My right-of-way agreement?
My sign-offs.
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
everything's right around the corner.
We got both the plumbing and
the electrical inspectors on for tomorrow
tuesday the fire department's coming out,
and that should do it, String
you'll be on your way.
And by the way, congratulations.
You are now minority contractor
for light bulb supply
to the Board of Education,
city of Baltimore.
What the fuck I know
about light bulbs, man?
Do you know how to put the words
on a B-and-B letterhead?
Come on, man, relax,
white guy's doing all the work.
You're just his beard
for the empowerment grant.
That's an extra five g's a month
for just laying in the cut.
See how it work?
I'm gonna bring you along,
String, but...
it ain'tonna be an overnight thing.
We spend this year
dealing with the city
the next doing business
with the state.
However, year three?
Then we go for the gold.
Then we go federal.
Then we see the man
with his hand on the faucet.
What faucet?
The hud faucet, the money faucet.
Look, man, I don't know why we got
to wait three years for that shit?
I'm ready to run now.
No, you're not.
I mean, forgive me, but...
you still showin' a little bit of that
street corner mentality.
buggin' about every dime you spend
about the permits,
about setting up a pac
about dropping cash
into re-election war chests
which by the way,
is how i get my gravy.
Look, it takes money
to make money, String
otherwise, hell,
every pauper'd be a king.
You know what I'm saying?
I'm ready to run now.
Three years.
Crawl, walk, and then run.
Naw man, nappy up there
a little bit more.
And the eyes.
He had little beanie eyes.
What the fuck is beanie eyes?
You know, little rat-eyes.
Yeah, a-ight.
Yo, put a mole on there.
He didn't have a mole.
He did too.
You was just too busy shitting
yourself with that whistle
to your dome
to see the motherfucker.
Shit, fuck I did.
How do you know how to do this?
Man, how you don't now
how to do this?
Make his ears stick out.
- Why?
- 'Cause I told you to.
Ho shit, okay.
Give him light eyes.
- Why?
- 'Cause I fuckin' told you to.
Okay, can you make 'em cross?
This is fuckin' cool.
Check out these knuckleheads
on the make-a-face.
Fuck this shit.
Look, I'm just tryin'
to make my district liveable.
Write off a few blocks
in a few places but I save the rest.
No offense, but you're like
the blind man and the elephant.
It's a lot bigger than what
you got your hand on
you just can't see it.
See what?
A great village of pain,
and you're the mayor.
Where's your drinking water?
Where's your toilets,
your heat, your electricity?
Where's the needle truck, the condom
distribution, the drug treatment intake?
Half these people
are dying on their feet
and the other half's
gonna catch what's killin' 'em.
Look, they ain't no worse off
than when they were all over the map.
Now they just in one place is all.
And that place is hell.
Look, I'm a police.
So I can lock a man up or I can
move his ass off the corner.
Now, you want anything
more than that
you're in the wrong shop.
Hey, yo, make her hair
a little bit more straight.
Make it long.
With bangs.
Yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about.
Now chinese up them eyes,
like Beyonce.
Get them cheekbones
up a little bit.
Naw, man, that's too much.
She startin' to look like
a pie tin with hair now, yo.
Hang on.
Yeah, alright.
Pillow up them lips a little bit.
Oh yeah, hook me up with that.
Yo, you got one
of these does asses?
What?
Yeah, that's what's up, dang.
Hey, guys.
How you doing?
We're looking
for a cash purchase in here
maybe a couple Trac phones,
week or so back.
Black guy most likely.
Oh sure, that guy.
Every two weeks for him.
Last time, eight phones.
Almost $900.
That's a lot of ring dings, no?
Ring dings?
A joke.
You got some kind
of transaction record?
Sikh and ye shall find.
Hang on.
Hang on.
$927.24.
Can we have the tape for that day?
No tape. I rewind every day.
- Keep this?
- Sure.
The fuck do we do now?
Buy this guy a box of videotapes?
Or camp out in this shithole for a week,
hoping our boy runs the same route?
I just know, I got to put my mind
on something or I'm gonna slide back.
Need to be in control of myself,
you know what I'm sayin'?
Take command of your life.
Something.
Cultivate some self-discipline.
Or whatever.
What if I told you that there's
a certain liberation
not in command or in self-control
but in surrendering?
Well, that depends on
who you're surrendering to.
Oh, that.
All due respect?
You can stow that patter
right here and now.
Look, it ain't about me
doin' for me, I don't think.
Might need to be
about more than that.
So you're bringing in an overall decline
of two percent for the month
but if I read this correctly,
almost half of that's coming from
an eight percent drop
in the western district?
Major Colvin is himself
willing to acknowledge
the possibility of a statistical
variation from the mean
in his monthly stats.
Variation, huh?
Gentlemen, if I look through
the western incident reports
am I likely to find less crime,
or more incidents
which have been
downgraded or unfounded?
Because this kind of variation
screams manipulation to me.
And if I'm wrong about that
if indeed there is
no manipulation involved
I would like to know exactly
what it is that Major Colvin
has learned about police work
that eludes the rest of your commanders.
Councilman, I assure you
these stats are not massaged.
We don't do that.
I don't do that.
And I won't allow
my people to do that.
Our feeling is that
it's genuinely an aberration
and if it repeats
itself next month
then it bears closer
examination, otherwise...
Moving on to new business then.
How are we fixed for witness assistance?
Does the department have
sufficient funds
to ensure pre-trial security
for any endangered witnesses?
We have the resources that
the city can afford, I'm sure.
I understand you're in no
position to criticize the Mayor.
- Nor would I.
- Nor would you.
So allow me to ask the question:
What is this city willing to pay,
to make it possible for ordinary people
to come down to the courthouse
and perform the civic duty
of bearing witness against
gangsters and criminals?
What resources are commensurate
with that kind of commitment?
You can play the good soldier,
if you want, Commissioner.
But I want to go on the record here
in saying that this administration
has passed the buck time and again.
And failed to protect those citizens
who demonstrate that kind of commitment
and put their lives
and livelihood at risk.
And I would only like to add,
that I feel as my colleague does
that this administration has
failed this community miserably.
And we need to do
something about this.
Y'all are friends.
Y'all like brothers.
You lose that you lose
every damn thing.
Kids messed up the good hoop
now they got one looks like
the original peach basket
an' they hangin' onto it like a tit.
I don't know.
Maybe I should get up
some kind of tournament.
You play basketball?
Never was much
for balls and sticks.
I was all about my hands.
Boxer?
Yeah.
Boxing.
I know a place where
some of the kids go, but...
it ain't nearly
close enough to here.
I wouldn't mind
takin' a look at it.
Get a mental picture at least.
What the hell is goin' on here?
Police pushed all the action
down here and a couple other places.
The Deacon thinks
that maybe some people
should come in here
and take over this situation?
You that people?
One of 'em, maybe.
Roman, man.
Dennis.
You should lay back on this one.
Lemme go talk to Buford Pusser
in there alone.
Excuse me?
And what it shows people
is that I know my business
that I will hold people
accountable based on the facts.
- This is about what's right.
- There you go again.
What?
Do you think politics is only
about winning the argument?
That whoever has the right fact
at the right moment wins?
Clinton had facts.
Kennedy had facts, yeah.
But Reagan?
He couldn't have summoned a fact
if his life depended on it.
It's not just facts,
it's how you use them.
And Tommy, when you
get hold of a fact or two
you go smartass
and start beating on people.
- That's because...
- Clinton and Reagan?
When they got up to speak
they gave everyone in the room
comfort and confidence.
You liked those guys.
You were happy to think
that they even liked you.
You're saying I'm not likeable?
Jen?
When you're at home, talking with me
not the council, not the cameras,
you're great.
When you tell me
what's really important to you
I believe.
You're smart and you're ambitious
and you've got
a sharper tongue than most.
You can hold court
and you can tell a good story
and you can win
the argument if you want.
All of that shows, Tommy
and at a Baltimore
city council meeting it shows well
but if you want to be mayor
or senator, or governor one day...
...show them something more.
Baltimore, huh?
Went up there to the harbor with
my wife for our anniversary?
Charged us $12 for two beers.
Shit, that's the least of it.
The whole damn town's
gone to hell in a handbasket
and guess who's running the show?
Who?
Who do you think?
The department, city hall, the courts.
Shit, the courts?
You know what they call it when judge
jury and perp all go
to the same family barbecue?
Catch and release.
No shit.
May God have mercy on any poor
white boy going to trial.
That's when everybody's got their ass
in the air talking' about justice
can't wait to throw away the key.
I mean, they're not all so bad.
Actually, there's a lot of good ones.
I'm on the radio if you need me.
My wife, Carol Ann.
Some very good ones.
Is there anything
specific I can help you with
while you're down here, detective?
Or is this just a courtesy call?
You know, you should meet my partner.
You'd like her.
Can't go through
the front on this boy.
So I'm thinkin' we're gonna
have to creep around the back.
Get Devonne on it?
I got this for that other problem.
- Who this?
- Remember Fat Face Rick, right?
Been going to them co-op
meetings with String?
That's his cousin, Trina.
Oh you mean,
Trina with the big old ass.
Yeah, you on it.
That's her work number.
You know where she work nowadays?
She over at the department
of social services.
So you thinkin' Omar gettin' a check?
Not now. But i mean
once upon a time, before...
some fool gave lil' Omar
Little a shotgun, I mean
cocksucker was
somebody's child, right?
So I'm thinking somewhere
down in them records
is one or two names
of Omar's people.
You feel me?
You sure you want us
on Marlo and Omar both?
I mean, Omar ain't come back
on us since we got his bitch
- so maybe...
- Look, I'm home, Charles.
I'm home.
Was up?
Takin' care of business, String?
Me too, man.
Me too.
East side wasn't
ready for us, huh?
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah, I know all about Baba Jani
and his 24-hour turnover.
It's a real pain in my ass too.
He's got a little problem
with the school kids there.
Every afternoon come 3:00
they go in there,
crowd him at the counter
boost all the car
and gun magazines.
That surveillance tape's
so grainy now
it's like watching a herd
of buffalo in a snowstorm.
But my insurance man, Bob?
Got him to turn this camera here
right on Baba's parking lot.
Now anytime I have a real problem?
I just come to Bob
and pull his tape.
I can get a copy of that
for you in the morning.
Your...
Your partner there?
Bit of an asshole.
For real?
<i>Keep your right hand up. </i>
You know what this is?
It's moral midgetry.
Turn the fuckin' world upside down.
Treat these braindead
corner yo's like princelings.
You see how clean the corners are?
In every sector, street traffic
is half of what it was.
Fuck that.
It's wrong, and it's wrong.
Like the other way was right
because we were doing so well.
And Colvin's answer is what?
Ride shotgun for hoppers?
Drown them in cash money paid?
Colvin?
He's always been good police.
He's got to know
what a fuckin' heartbreaker
it is to wake up every morning,
suit up for this shit.
He's got to suit up too, man.
Somebody should dime
the brass about this shit.
Or the Sun papers.
Let me ask you something.
Anybody here ever get jammed up
and not have Colvin
go to the wall for you?
The man is trying something.
It may be hard to stomach,
but it's working.
After 30 years don't you think
he's earned the right
to some elbow room on this?
What the fuck. This thing is
on borrowed time anyhow.
And when we do decide
to jump on the Hamsterdams
they're just gonna go back to
their regular corners, right?
If we ever jump out on it.
I don't know that we're gonna.
All I'm sayin' is we give
the guy the same back-up
he's always given us.
That's all I'm sayin'.
I swear as soon as the sun comes
up we grab the damn tape and go.
This place makes me want to cry.
Hey, I spent half my marriage
in rooms like this.
How could you do it?
What?
Go non-stop hound
on your ex like that.
It was easy.
Just tell her I was on the road
working an extradition.
Lots of extraditions.
Brought back something
like 500 fugitives
in a three-year period, I think.
That's not what I meant.
Right.
So, you back in the house, huh?
Ate some shit
and she took me back, yeah.
Ain't sure I even want
to be back, though.
Extraditions, huh?
Cheryl'd see right
through that shit.
Nah, it's easy.
Just keep your cell off,
make sure she can reach your partner.
Partner tells her:
"Kima's in court" or whatever.
Partner calls you at the motel
gives you the heads up
you call her back later like:
"hey, what's up?"
Ain't even have a quarter box
for magic fingers.
Maybe you don't need
a quarter box for that.
For what?
Magic fingers.
Hey, you know me.
<i>... we'll talk with a singer
songwriter who's burning up</i>
<i>the charts with a hit
he'll perform for us tonight. </i>
You hustlin'?
Educatin'.
Charging for it or tuition-free?
Tuition will come back to him
ten-fold in acquired wisdom.
Besides, nothing in the world's
more expensive than "free".
S'all she wrote.
Let's double it.
Naw man, I don't like takin'
money from a church-goin' man.
Triple it.
Your break, Deacon.
We need to talk
some more about Amsterdam.
Look, man,
I never said it was pretty.
Pretty don't even
come close to the problem.
We need to talk.
I've got comstat meeting.
I'll drop by later on.
So we good with the permits?
Yeah, this week, so far, so good.
A- ight.
Look at you.
Who?
Chunky Coates.
Who's that?
You don't know Chunky?
He's got the properties
down the block and over
on the even side of Paca Street.
When I first met that fat man,
he had an office so small
you had to leave
the room to change your mind.
Then two years ago he started running
with your man, Clay Davis.
Look at you now,
you big sassy bitch.
That better?
Hey, special agent Fitzhugh
if that is in fact your real name.
FBI in on this?
I am only loved for my toys.
Lester called and I delivered.
You got the tape?
Date of ten-ten-oh-four,
fifteen-oh-four hours
30 seconds, by the register tape.
Mama Barksdale?
D'Angelo's mother.
She cold-called McNulty
about her son on the jailhouse hangin'.
She's callin' us
on that weak shit?
Is this, uh...
Brianna?
Right.
You called about your son.
I'm returning that message.
Nothing there.
It's so tiny.
No mere mortal can.
You see what he just did?
What? He did it again?
Who is this man?
Where does he come from?
Can anybody stop him?
Please don't hurt us.
Please my eyes, my eyes.
It's so big and clear and bright.
I'll be at homicide.
Sometimes, you still scare me,
you know that?
In my world, do you have
any idea what I had to do
to get where I am today?
Now when I say i ready,
you best believe it.
Through the effective
use of resources
an increased police presence
and an intensive reach
out into the community
we've been able to have
a significant impact on these areas
to the effect
of a 12% decrease overall.
12%.
Cumulatively.
Over four weeks.
Major, I know I gave you shit
when your stats took
a jump a few weeks back
but now you're gonna shove
the numbers right up my ass.
It's kind of pouty of you,
isn't it?
12%.
I didn't cook 'em then,
I ain't cookin' 'em now.
Seriously, Bunny. I already got
the City Council asking questions
about the eight percent drop
you posted last week.
We just want to please the Mayor,
not go to jail behind this shit.
Sometimes the Gods do listen, sir.
Not in the Western they don't.
Lieutenant Daniels.
Sir?
You want to take credit
for any of this?
Your unit's been working in
that district a couple of weeks.
We're barely up on anything.
In fact, the crews we're
looking at are still beefing
still dropping bodies.
Amazing.
Crime is down and no one
wants to take any credit.
What is wrong with this picture?
You don't mind
if I have planning and research
pull all your C.C. numbers
make sure there's not a decimal point
missing between the one and the two?
Pull everything, Deputy.
My number will stand.
<i>Hey, tell Landsman, line
twenty-one-oh-three's for him. </i>
I called because I heard
you went and visited Donette
told her my son's death
couldn't have been no suicide.
Is that right?
I did do that.
D'Angelo hung himself.
Not with the belt
they found around his neck.
Not at that distance between
the doorknob and the floor.
So what are you saying?
What am I saying.
No.
Nobody would've dared.
My brother,
his uncle would have...
I agree with you.
Nobody would've dared.
Unless...
Avon and Dee was family.
Family, right.
This is just you talking, right?
I mean, anyone else saying that...
Nah, just me.
No one else cares.
Right.
It's just, I dunno, on the inside
if somebody's going after you
has got a beef, sees red,
they use a shank.
It's quick and it's over.
D'Angelo was strangled
which is planned.
You need the time,
you need the isolation.
Look, I'm just sorry I brought
this whole mess up to begin with
because frankly nobody's
gonna do shit about it anyhow.
Whoever killed him wanted
to pass it off as a suicide
and the cops are happy enough
to have one less murder to investigate.
On top of that, the Anne Arundel
State's Attorney doesn't give a fuck
I'm not supposed
to give a fuck, so...
I guess your son just got
squeezed between the sides.
Squeezed between what sides?
Look, two years ago
we hung more wire
on your brother's crew than AT&T
and at the end, D'Angelo was
this close to flipping.
Giving up everybody, everything.
But you know all that right?
You were the one who went down
to that detention center
and talked your son out of a deal.
I kinda liked your son, you know?
All things considered,
he was a pretty decent kid.
And it grinds me that no one
ever spoke up for him
and seems to me
that nobody ever will.
But mostly at this point?
I'm sorry I bothered his girl
and I'm sorry she bothered you.
Why go to her?
Why not come to me first?
Honestly?
I was looking for somebody
who cared about the kid.
I mean, like I said...
you were the one how made him
take the years, right?
<i>Red leader to red boys. </i>
<i>Red two come in. </i>
<i>Cheese steak has a problem, bitch. </i>
Save me some fries, yo...
<i>You want fries. </i>
<i>I suggest you bring
some cash up here. </i>
You believe this?
No muscle,
it's all out in the open.
Naw naw naw, man...
This right here, boy.
This too good.
Hey yo, this some kinda
full-tilt setup, man
to catch some master-scoundrel,
Capone an' whatnot.
Boy, they prob'ly got police behind
every one of those rowhouse windows.
Hit this?
You must be trippin'.
Home, James...
I'ma tell you, boy,
you better keep your head
back in the game or you gonna
land us both in the pokey.
- What you lookin' at?
- You.
Yeah.
I like you're eyes.
They like cat's eyes.
Who you here with?
Them.
That's it?
What kind of cat?
What?
What kind of cat my eyes like?
A big cat.
You here with them
and no one else?
I said that.
You want to dance?
Hell, no.
You want a drink?
No, don't do that neither.
What do you do?
Gene, this spot
I'm telling you about?
We're talking TB, HIV, syphilis, herpes, lice...
It's like a five-acre petri dish.
You get in there now
you can run every health program
or social program you want.
Every kinda liberal-ass project
never got off the page
it was written on.
Jurassic park.
So, you're saying this is a
sanctioned open-air drug market.
No, it's not officially sanctioned.
It's more like it's tolerated.
That's why we came to
you and the public health school
not the city health department.
Needle exchange, drug outreach,
condoms, HIV-testing.
Y'all ain't never gonna reach
more people in the same spot.
So if the city doesn't know about it.
That makes it...
Complicated.
That means temporary.
You move it or you lose it, boss.
That was nice.
Work for me.
You free tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
You could come back to my crib,
nobody's there but my grandma.
Get us a real bed,
take some time with it.
Give me your number.
The reason I'm sayin'
tomorrow not to push
but day after that I got
to go visit my aunt in Florida.
We hook up tomorrow,
I got something real nice
to think about
on that long-ass bus ride.
After you.
What was it again?
Devonne.
This guys running
his route every five days.
That's a shitload of burners.
I don't get it.
They're were so careful
spreading out the purchases
up and down the three states
you'd think he'd also
switch up rental agencies.
Maybe the guy felt bad for us.
You got a copier, right?
Damn, girl,
what you lose some weight?
Excuse me?
It's just a compliment.
Yo, at's Mrs. Omar?
Yeah, his grandmoms.
So what, we jack her
an' make her talk?
Fool, she probably got no clue
where he lay his head.
Naw, man,
we sit an' we wait, right?
Man, wait on what?
You see, if we go upstairs,
we'll spook him.
So he's coming down.
Alright.
Russell Bell.
I know B-and-B like I know
a thousand other outfits
but I don't know him.
Why should I talk to him?
Because Russell's a good man.
And he's ready to run.
Then let him run for you.
Hang on.
Wait a minute, partner.
I don't think you know who
you're dealing with here.
You know who that is?
Got your running shoes on?
You're in.
That's the faucet?
Shit, as far as the federal money's
concerned, he's everything.
The faucet, the goose...
What goose?
The one that lays them golden eggs.
Madison Square Garden it ain't
but it could work.
You're gonna need
a little help with the clean-up.
I'll piece that together.
This my trip, man.
Need to go from
"a" to "b" all by my self.
<i>... Am I likely to find less crime</i>
<i>or more incidents that have
been downgraded or unfounded?</i>
<i>Because this kind of variation
screams manipulation to me. </i>
Slow your words.
<i>Indeed there is no
manipulation involved... </i>
Try to lock your eyes
on whoever you talk to.
Make them think they matter.
Use open, warm phrases.
nothing sharp, nothing that bites.
Where's the fun in that?
Do you want this?
<i>What is this city willing to pay</i>
<i>to make it possible
for ordinary people to... </i>
It's me.
<i>Hey, how you cat eyes?</i>
When you say ya leaving again?
<i>Tomorrow, wanna
get together tonight?</i>
Yeah, we can hook up tonight.
<i>How about coming over
to my crib?</i>
Naw, not your crib.
<i>Where then?</i>
Go to a motel.
<i>You want me to meet you?</i>
<i>Which one?</i>
I don't know which one.
I'll tell you when I see you.
<i>I'd like to see you soon. </i>
Alright, you know the Lake Trout?
<i>Carryout?</i>
<i>Where?</i>
On Woodland.
<i>Off Midtown Road. </i>
That one.
<i>Later this afternoon?</i>
<i>I'll be there. </i>
<i>What time you want to meet?</i>
Like five.
And five mean five.
I don't truck C.P. time.
Five and change, I'm gone.
<i>I ain't gonna be late. </i>
Alright then.
<i>See you then. </i>
What you think about that?
I don't know.
Might be walkin'
into something a little later.
So I'm gonna need
for you to go up there
get me a read up front.
Where's my brother?
Shut the door, man.
Yo, we at war right now, sis.
So he on that.
I need to get with him.
Well, he ain't on the cell phone
soon as I speak to him,
I'll get him to you, alright?
Can't believe this shit.
Heard from this cop.
He sayin' Dee was murdered.
Oh, that'd be McNulty.
How you know?
Levy figured he couldn't
talk you out of that meet
but I sure wish he'da tried.
I need to get with my brother.
Oh, c'mon.
This fucking cop.
He trying to drive
a wedge up in here.
You can't see it.
Look, I can imagine
how hard it is
for a mother to have to deal
with some shit like that.
No doubt. But the fact is,
these places, they press on niggers.
Dee just figured a way
to get out of there early.
Ain't nothing nobody
could do about that.
I mean, how do you
protect a man from himself?
Where Avon at?
I'll go to him.
I told you. We beefin' for corners
right now and as soon as I speak to him
I'll get him to you, I promise.
A cop shouldn't mess
with a mother's pain like that.
No one should.
Yeah, let me get
four trout on white
extra mayo on one,
hot sauce on two
and the other with ketchup,
and four orange sodas.
This clown ass nigger went
and got four sammiches.
Four sodas, you heard me?
Cool.
Niggas don't roll out in a few
minutes, we on to something.
<i>Drop one, get one. </i>
Nah, baby, this one's sentimental.
Here, it's bleach.
Just soak your works
and you're good to go.
<i>Drop one get one. </i>
<i>Drop one, get one. </i>
Get the other girls to come by.
Or wait.
Just pass these out for me, okay?
Yo, I get swoled up
from Peanut Butter.
You got anything else?
The fuck I look like to you,
Chef Boyardee?
Who?
Hey, when all this bullshit falls apart,
I'm gonna kick your fucking...!
Go by them slow.
Oh shit!
<i>Oh, my god!</i>
You hit?
No.
Drive, motherfucker,
get out of here!
Your man better be
as good as his word.
Or your word.
If you are still in possession
of that kind of mentality?
Then you are definitely not ready.
- String?
- Not now.
- It's Avon...
- Shut the door.
Let's do this.
I'll be in touch, partner.
- What is it, man?
- Avon's been hit.
- Where?
- In the shoulder.
Tater got kilt, but Avon
still breathin', man.
But Brianna all over me,
calling me, man.
- I need to tell her.
- Naw, fuck Brianna.
What?
Just keep the bitch
away from me, ya hear me?
If you put them
pitbull-style stitches in me
the next patient's gonna be you.
For real.
What, you don't like rawhide?
Oooh, Marlo.
We're finally gettin'
back to old times, baby.
Hey, Anthony, where you at?
First-floor, 10-34 North Mount, sir.
Good.
They expecting us to hit back wild.
That's what they just waiting for
and we're gonna sit
back on it for awhile
let 'em sweat on it.
Yo, we gotta talk.
Hold on.
I mean, he got to come out on his corners,
that's how he make money, right?
We gonna see who got
the bigger war chest. Avon.
Straight to the mattresses, huh?
Whatever, what you want, man?
War, man, we're past this bullshit.
Oh yeah, I forgot.
I knew I forgot something.
We the Trump brothers.
You don't give this shit up
you're gonna turn
everything we built to shit.
Naw.
The chump brothers.
You know what the difference's
between me and you?
I bleed red
you bleed green.
What you been building for us?
I look at you these days
you know what I see?
I see a man without a country.
Not hard enough for this right here
and maybe, just maybe
not smart enough
for them out there.
Not hard enough.
No offense.
I don't think you ever really were.
You got skills, yeah,
no doubt, but... what?
What, 'cause I don't
shoot up a block
indiscriminate I ain't hard enough?
Huh? Because I think
before I snatch a life,
I ain't into this bullshit?
Snatch a life.
What life you snatch, huh?
You know Brianna went downtown,
man, saw that detective.
Man stokin' her head sayin' that
D'Angelo's death was no suicide.
Yeah, so...
Man ain't wrong about that.
What?
I knew you couldn't do it
and Brianna wouldn't do that shit.
But there goes a life
that had to be snatched, Avon.
Yo man, I took that shit off you
and put it on me, man
because that motherfucker
was out of pocket with that shit!
20 years above his fucking head.
He flip, man, they got you,
me and fucking Brianna!
And no fucking way, man.
Hell no!
Now, I know you family.
You loved that nigger.
But you want to talk that blood
is thicker than water bullshit
take that shit
somewhere else, nigger!
That motherfucker woulda taken down
the whole fucking show
starting with you, killer!
It's fucking everything
and everybody!
Let me up.
Let me up.
Shit.

Hullo...
<i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>
Oh, hi.
<i>Are you sleeping?</i>
No.
<i>What, you're not happy
to hear from me?<i>
No, I'm glad you called.
<i>I want to see you. <i>
Now?
<i>Yes, now. </i>
Where are you?
<i>Same place as before. </i>
Peabody.
<i>Are you sure
you're not sleeping?</i>
No, no, I was up.
<i>You liar. </i>
<i>Come on, get
your ass over here. <i>
Yeah, okay, I mean,
yeah, what the hell.
<i>Room 210.</i>
Fine.
Sean, Seanie...
What?
I have to go out and see
a friend for a little bit.
I'll be gone for
an hour or two, okay?
I put my cell phone number
is on this slip of paper.
I'll put it on that
top shelf, okay?
What did I just say?
You're going out
to see a friend
and your number is
on the top shelf.
Attaboy.
<i>The Kerry camp had
an early opportunity</i>
<i>to capitalize on jobs
and the economy as an issue</i>
<i>and attack
the president with it. </i>
<i>The pre-election polls show
that a significant number</i>
<i>of undecided and persuadable
voters thought Kerry over Bush</i>
<i>offered a better
chance for jobs. </i>
<i>Jobs may have been
a marginal issue, Kate</i>
<i>in some of the rust belt
battle ground states. </i>
<i>But ultimately
this was a referendum</i>
<i>on the leadership of George W. Bush</i>
<i>on the war against terror
and the war in Iraq. </i>
You are so full of shit.
Nothing mattered in the red
states but the economy...
I've been saying that for months.
Hey, I'm not tossing you
so quick tonight.
I got nothing to do tomorrow.
Well, I'm tossing myself.
I gotta get home.
You know what, not that
this wasn't fun
but it might be nice
to have dinner first.
Dinner and a movie.
I got to Baltimore late.
Nah, I'm saying next time.
We talk some, then
we fuck our brains out.
It's different for girls like me.
You need to be cuddled, McNulty?
No, but we make a date
I don't feel like I have
to charge by the hour.
A date, huh?
I'll call you.
In the daytime.
<i>I think we can all agree that
foreign policy and women... </i>
<i>... all the while the United States
was reeling from the attack</i>
<i>on Pearl Harbor... </i>
<i>the wonders of
wood carving... </i>
<i>he wrapped himself
in the american flag</i>
<i>at the convention
and never looked back. </i>
<i>Oh, Kate, that's a little
harsh, don't you think?</i>
<i>No, I don't, I'm serious. </i>
<i>And I think it was great
strategy by his handlers, too. </i>
<i>You don't think when John Kerry
in his acceptance speech</i>
<i>at the Democratic
National Convention said:</i>
<i>"I'm here under old glory"</i>
<i>that he wasn't trying to wrap
himself in a flag, too?</i>
<i>No, I don't think he was trying
to wrap himself in a flag. </i>
<i>I think he was trying
to defend the people</i>
<i>in the battle ground states.
The ones who really... </i>
<i>1942, the U.S. first stormed
the shore at Guadalcanal. </i>
<i>Seizing a nearly complete
airfield at Moga Point</i>
<i>which was renamed
Henderson Field. </i>
<i>And in anchorage
and nearby Tulagy</i>
<i>that would later be known
as "iron bottom sound"</i>
<i>because of the number
of ships sunk there in battle. </i>
<i>The landings of the first day
put nearly 11,000 marines</i>
</i>on the island,
minimal resistance... </i>
Slapstick
Deep into it, I see.
Yeah, gettin' there.
You lookin' correct.
Sunday morning. I'm on my way
to hear the word, you know?
Gracias, amigos.
You payin' those guys
out of pocket?
Boiler in there's working
and the pipes are okay.
I should have it all cleaned
out by tomorrow, I think.
All you gonna need is the permits.
Permits?
Yeah.
Permits.
Whoa, is that him?
S hit.
If it ain't, we'd only
be wasting the bullet.
Only problem is it bein' Sunday
mornin' an all, you know?
Who you callin'?
Slim Charles, man.
You told me you was supposed
to bring our beefin'
before the group, right?
Here it is you go warrin' with the
young boy, Marlo, over corners.
Marlo ain't in the group.
Be that as it may
all this shoot-em-up shit
is bad f business.
We got cops on half
the Westside corners.
And what corners
they ain't holding
I cat have my people
standing on for fear
they gonna be mistaken
as one of Barksdale people
an' catch a bullet.
Look, man, I tried to talk
to the young buck myself, but...
You try talkin' to Avon.
Because that's half
the problem right there.
No doubt, exactly.
Nigger probably sleepin' in.
Fact is, Stringer, your man
needs to reconcile himself
to this new way of thinking.
Now, you could remind him that
like everyone else in this room
he benefiting from my connect
and from the wholesale price
we got by throwin' in together.
I mean, he know that, come on, Joe.
Well, so, now we comin' to him
for help with a little something.
He need to just back the fuck off
and let the youngun keep his corners.
You said yourself it can't
be about territory no more.
Old habits die hard.
Who this?
Yeah, it's me.
We on the house where
the dude who is, you know...
Talk, nigga.
Shit, man, I'm tryin'
not to use names.
This Gerard, man.
We on Omar, he goin'
to come out the house.
As you know, I ain't trying to lose
no niggers on them corners either but
it's a two way street, you know?
Gerard and Sapper
got their sights on omar.
They tried to raise Slim
an' he ain't answering.
So?
It's church day, String.
Sunday morning, you know?
They sure it's him?
Omar, yeah.
Alright, do it.
Do it.
They right there, c'mon.
Oh, my goodness!
This time, I definitely hit him.
District-wide, it's 14%.
A drop like that in the western
felony rate is unheard of.
But God knows what happens
when you let go of your secret.
Hey, what happens, happens.
I mean, if they want to keep
my little experiment going
or they want to go back
to business as usual.
That's on them. But me?
I'm out of here, D., I'm gone.
And... Hopkins came through.
I got the contract offer
on that security job yesterday.
You really gonna retire?
Always planned to.
What?
You started something.
You ain't gonna finish it?
What do you mean?
On a battlefield, you can't do much
to help anybody with anything.
But you managed a truce, Bunny.
And making the game street legal...
takes the heart out of it.
Keep it going, we gonna
reach some of those people
chasing dope and coke
and maybe even
some hoppers, too.
You might at that.
But what happens when you turn
your district over to the next man?
Or people get wind of this thing
and there's no one to defend it?
What then?
How's the contrast on that?
Good for daylight.
Yeah?
On a Sunday,
what the fuck, Lester?
I could say the same of you.
Elena's taking the kids
to her mother's
what the fuck else
am I gonna do?
No life
no marriage, no kids.
No problem.
What's with the video?
Gonna put it up
in one of the windows
across from Stringer's print shop.
Catch him coming and going.
Hey, you need help?
You're a known face.
I figure me and Prez
do it on a Sunday
shop is closed, looking
like working men...
you know something, Lester?
I do believe there
aren't five swingin' dicks
in this entire department
who can do what we do.
I'm not sayin' like
all chest out and shit.
It's just, you think about it
there's maybe, what,
3,000 sworns, right?
100 or so are bosses,
so not a fucking clue there?
A few more hundred is
sergeants and lieutenants
and most of them
wanna be bosses one day
so they're just as fucked...
then there's 600 or 700
fuckin' housecats, you know?
Deskmen...
and in the patrol division?
There's probably a little
bit of talent there, but...
the way the city is right now,
that's 1500 guys...
chasin' calls and clearin' corners...
I mean, nobody's knowing his post,
nobody's building nothing, right?
And C.I.D. is the same.
Catching calls,
chasing quick clearances
keeping everything
in the shallow end...
I mean who is it out there that
can do what we do with a case?
How many are there really?
Don Worden, Ed Burns.
Gary Childs out in the county
John O'Neil and Steve Cleary
over at Woodlawn...
oh, they bring it in,
but there's not many.
There's not many.
We're good at this, Lester.
In this town, we're
as good as it gets.
Natural police.
Fuck yes, natural police.
Tell me something, Jimmy.
How exactly do you
think it all ends?
What do you mean?
A parade?
A gold watch?
A shining Jimmy-McNulty-day moment
when you bring in a case
so sweet that everybody
gets together and says:
"Oh shit, he was right all along.
We shoulda listened to the man. "
The job will not save you, Jimmy.
It won't make you whole,
it won't fill your ass up.
I dunno.
- A good case...
- ends.
They all end.
The handcuffs go
click and it's over
and the next morning it's just
you in the room with yourself.
Until the next case.
Boy, you need something
outside of this here.
Like what?
Dollhouse miniatures?
A life, a life, Jimmy,
you know what that is?
It's the shit that happens
while you're waiting for moments
that never come.
On a Sunday morning...
we called to ask.
Shamrock said to go.
On a Sunday morning
y'all try to hit a nigger
when he takin' his
wrinkled-ass grandmoms to pray.
And you all don't hit
the nigger, neither.
All y'all kill is
grandma's crown?
By the time sham tells us to go,
omar's damn near in the cab...
Ain't enough that y'all violated
the Sunday morning truce.
No!
I'm standin' here holdin'
a torn-up church crown
of a bona-fide colored lady.
Do you know what
a colored lady is?
Not your mamas, for sure.
'Cause if they was that
y'all would have known better
better than that bullshit.
Y'all triflin' with Avon
Barksdale's reputation here.
You know that?
She alright though?
She got cut on her
face from the glass
an' she sore from
where I fell on her.
But other an' that though...
you saved her ass, huh.
I damn near got
that woman kilt, yo.
Y'all shoulda seen me in Sinai
hospital while they stitchin' her up
lyin' about why somebody want
to shoot me down in the street.
That woman thinks
I work in a cafeteria.
Cafeteria?
At the airport, yeah.
Airport, why the airport?
'Cause I know she ain't
never gonna go down there
to go dining that's why.
Yo, Kimmy, this ain't funny, yo.
That woman raised me.
An for as long as I've been
grown, once a month
I been with her on a church Sunday.
Tellin' myself ain't
no need to worry
'cause there's ain't
nobody in this city
that low-down to disrespect
a Sunday morning.
Y'all know I was gonna
walk away, right?
Y'all knew that, right?
I mean, after Tosha, I was
gonna leave them people be, yo.
Avon home now.
Oh, Barksdale's gots to go.
Stringer too.
This thing got to end, man.
I swear to god, yo,
on a Sunday morning
they near shot her
best crown off, yo.
I mean, no shame them
niggers. Y'all feel me?
I'm out.
If you back to dealin' with
Barksdale people, I'm out, yo.
I'm in it for the money.
It's easier out there than that.
Jus' you an' me then.
Like it was.
Naw, yo.
This one about me.
And nobody else.
Hey...
I'm with you.
Not on this one you ain't.
Okay, guys.
We are maybe a step and a half away
from being up on a
wire on these people.
All we need is to firm up the P.C.
showing the disposable phones
are being used in a drug conspiracy.
McNulty and Greggs,
you're on that angle.
You need to walk either
undercover or a wired C.I.
up to one of the Barksdale crews...
Lester, you and Prez
start typing affidavits
because when the probable
cause comes in
we're going to want to get
the application in fast.
Detective, you're the chaser
on our boy Bernard.
When he goes out for cell
phones, we're right behind.
The faster we get a hold
of the new numbers
the faster we're up
on those phones.
Now, when Caroline
comes back off vacation
she's going to be on the mini-cam.
From here on out
we keep a log on any
movement by Stringer
and we keep an eye out
for Mr. Barksdale as well.
Try to get a line on where
he spends his days.
As for me, I'm off to do battle
with the wireless company.
They a problem?
Have been since the damn
things were invented.
Okay, then.
Remember that with this wire
everything is a race
against the clock.
Anything we get up on
is only temporary.
You reach Bubbles?
Yeah. He'll be waiting
at Mount Clare.
Lee, where's the DNR log?
What?
The log.
Never mind, I got it right here.
All Stringer, all the time.
Theresa D'Agostino please.
<i>Hold please. </i>
Yeah, I'll hold.
<i>I'm sorry, she's not
in the office now. </i>
<i>You want to leave a message?</i>
No, I left one already.
A boxing gym?
For kids an' all. An athletic club.
Gyms, reducing salons,
public baths are permitted
only in properties zoned
b- two, b-three, b-four or b-five...
all signed and sealed by a
registered architect and engineer...
floor framing plan,
including the load criteria...
hydronic piping
and equipment layouts...
six copies of your
fire protection plan
with emergency exits
and sprinkler system...
health department, since it's a
physical culture and health service...
a license from the State Athletic
Commission, up on Calvert Street.
Mid-size or full?
Mid-sized.
You should upgrade an' get
one of them escalades.
They got that XM radio an' all...
I'm sayin' if we gonna be
in the damn car all damn day
it's worth it, Bernard.
You ticklish, bubs?
Chills, Kima.
You do that to me.
Here's the buy money, Bubs.
Remember, this is all on tape.
I hear you.
So down there on Vincent Street
they don't even hide
the ground stash anymore.
You watch and wait,
see when they're runnin' low.
Then ask for 30 or so.
Enough so that they have
to call for a quick re-up.
That's the important thing.
We want him to use his burner.
I get to keep the 30?
30 would kill you, Bubs.
You get to keep the money
we hand you once you come back
here with all of that product.
Just asking.
Just telling.
It can't be done.
Excuse me?
The activation information
you're gonna want?
That stuff's not accessible
from the business office
until it goes to billing
and that takes a few days,
sometimes a week or more.
But more than that,
we have dozens of
law enforcement
inquiries every month.
We get to them
in the order received
and currently the
turnaround's 30 days.
30 days.
Let me understand something.
Your company is in business
selling disposable cell phones
to people who don't have to give
any subscriber information
at the time of purchase, correct?
Correct.
They buy these phones
and as far as you're concerned
they use them anonymously,
prepaying for their minutes...
From the retailers, yes.
And while they are using
these phones, anonymously
for whatever purpose
they can't be monitored
by law enforcement
because your company
can't react within a month
to a court order for a wiretap.
We do the best we can.
This is bullshit.
You're selling a phone that you know
is effective for drug trafficking.
Lieutenant, our prepaid inventory
is there for young people
college students and such
people who can't afford
a permanent cell phone plan.
What college student
can't afford a cell phone?
They can afford
the fucking college
they can afford the phone
that goes with it.
I resent the suggestion.
Just so I'm clear:
You're telling me that
even if by some miracle
we are able to get up on a drug
dealer's disposable cell phone
in time to catch him talking
you're gonna take as much
as a month to activate our tap.
Look, if you have
a problem with that
your office can contact
our general counsel.
That's all I can say.
How about this?
How about the state's attorney
for Baltimore city
calls a press conference
on the courthouse steps
to declare that Bay Wireless is
in league with the most violent
drug traffickers in the city
preventing their apprehension
and arrest by law enforcement.
Four to five days turnaround.
Best we can do.
I swear, I felt like a damn balloon
with air rushin' out my ass
goin' from desk to desk.
This our new man, huh?
Frank Reid.
Dennis Wise.
Reverend, our man
Dennis spent all day
down at the Benton building,
trying for permits.
On the new gym?
Yeah.
You use my name?
You use anybody's name?
Hell, man. There was a time
I'da used Smith and Wesson.
Naw, look, man,
I'm just sayin'...
how do regular folk
get it done in this town?
Doreen
ring Delegate Watkins, please?
<i>Yellow tops, yellow tops. </i>
Obliged, man, obliged.
Keep me close, you know?
You tell a friend, okay?
Too hot for them
black tees, right?
Sup, hopper, what you hawkin'?
Body bags.
Alright, let me get 30... 30 pills.
30?
Where the fuck your raggedy-ass
come up with three-hunnert
in motherfucking cash, man?
I've been sellin' them
t- shirts for weeks now.
You know, I might be raggedy,
but I'm in a cash business.
You want my money or no?
Yeah, we out.
A- ight.
Shouldn't be long.
A bulk purchase justify
a discount, right?
250 or so...
275.
And a couple of them whiteys.
That'll work.
<i>That'll work. </i>
Bubs just made another 25.
Theresa D'Agostino, please.
<i>I'm sorry, but she's not in.
Can I take a message?</i>
No, I'll call back.
- So, how's that working?
- What?
Your new hope.
So far, so good.
You got the receipts, man?
Yeah, most of 'em.
A few blew out the damn
window on the interstate.
What, y'all waiting to see Avon?
I heard y'all shot a crown off
an ol' lady's head yesterday.
Good, you all made it.
Yeah...
we puttin' in some work.
C'mon upstairs so we can talk.
Back with numbers.
How many?
24 Trac phones.
Two each from Mondo Marts
in Catonsville and Sykesville
and four from Frederick
and then eight each from two stops
over the river in west Virginia.
Those bumper beepers?
They work great.
He went out I-70 this time.
Can you blame him?
The scenery's better.
24.
We're gonna have
a lot of D.N.R.'s up.
But with any luck
one of these phones leads
to young Mr. Bodie Broadus.
You want to call Pearlman.
A'ight.
Who's hungry?
How 'bout chinese?
Sounds good to me.
You guys call it in and I'll go.
Let me get some of that lo mein.
You take a turn typing
this shit, I'll go with him.
Make mine sweet and sour.
Lo mein for me.
So y'all get with Charles
he gonna get you
all the details on it.
Who they?
Eastside niggas.
Willing to soldier up
for us on retainer.
Milton put me up on them.
Man, we gonna be back
where we was, String.
You know, I can smell it.
We just got to get this boy Marlo
and then we spread out like we do.
Them co-op boys, man, they ain't
happy about this situation, man.
They say they got cops on corners
where they wouldn't have otherwise.
Everybody nervous.
Man, fuck them niggers.
I mean, Prop Joe said he'd mediate.
You know what I mean?
Go to Marlo and talk on it.
Yeah, well, he take a gun
with him, maybe it could work.
Lemme ask you, something though.
Did you tell them
discount ass niggers
they could pop off
at Omar's grandma.
Oh, man.
Sham comes to me
in the middle of the meeting
and talk about they got
their sights on Omar.
They say nothing about no grandma.
No church hat, nothing like that.
I hear the cocksucker's
name, I say, "go. "
On a Sunday morning?
Yo, I don't give a fuck, man.
I hear that cocksucker's name, man
I ain't thinkin'
about a church day.
A Sunday truce been around
long as the game itself, man.
I mean, you know what I'm sayin',
you can do some shit
and be like what the fuck, but hey,
just never on no Sunday, man.
I mean, it's just like people
was talkin' on us and all
and the stories are
getting bigger and bigger.
Like, I swear to god, Fatface Rick
heard that our people went an' shot
Omar granny's in the ass
on purpose, and all that.
And pulled their dicks out and
pissed on her crown an' shit.
I heard the same bullshit.
Prop Joe gave me an earful.
But yo, what can I say, man?
Good help is hard to find.
If it wasn't, you think I'd be
payin' Eastside niggers for shit?
Yo, we still off them corners?
Yeah, got to be.
We be off them corners
till we take care of Marlo.
Yeah, maybe we should
put a couple more crews
on them free zones them cops got.
You know what I mean?
Take the profit where we can.
You trust that shit?
I mean, so far.
An' if they runnin' a game
they ain't gonna get nobody
higher than a crew chief
to take a charge, right?
What you gonna do
with them two niggers
you got waitin' downstairs?
I make 'em buy the lady a new hat.
What're we waiting for?
Sweet-and-sour?
You do the cookie first?
What's the difference?
"A new friend makes himself known. "
Himself?
If it was herself,
then you'd have a fortune.
Shit, I'm married with
lawn furniture, man.
This technology's out
of control no question.
But that's nothing new.
The way these guys are
using disposables nowadays
we cannot get
a working wire up in time.
By the time we get subscriber
information and papers served...
they're dumping phones.
Cellular carrier is telling them
they need nearly a week
to process the paperwork.
They're only half-scared of us,
but a visit from the feds?
You all have profile
enough to push them.
I dunno. If you've got
them down to five days
you're doing about
as well as we can.
Once again, guys:
The bureau's a little busy
with counter terrorism.
Our U.S. attorney here
he only touches himself at the
mention of political corruption.
Ghetto drug stuff
just doesn't rate.
I'm sorry to say.
Shit always smells best
in the car, going home.
<i>Signal 13.</i>
<i>In the alley in the rear,
Eastside, 800 north Montford. </i>
That's five blocks,
up and over.
Go.
<i>What's the cross street?
What's the cross street?</i>
<i>Shots fired. </i>
<i>Sounded like it was
west of Milton... </i>
I'm police.
He's ten-seven, call it in.
That's a glock.
I saw the gun as he turned.
It's Derrick.
Jesus christ.
You killed Derrick.
It's Waggoner.
You fuckin' killed Waggoner!
Greggs.
<i>Prez shot another cop. </i>
What?
<i>It was an accident in
an alley, a little while ago. </i>
- No.
- <i>I'll call you back. </i>
You here for Barksdale?
I'm here for peace, man.
This some senseless shit goin' on.
But Barksdale ain't sent you?
Naw, Stringer knows I'm here, man.
If I can bring something
respectful back
they most likely to show the same.
Tell the boy he can
come in with the co-op.
If he takes our package,
which by the way
is better than the best
he putting out there now
he'll keep his corners.
Guaranteed.
He might listen.
But the boy got ideas.
And he's thinkin'
Avon weak right now.
You ever know Avon Barksdale
to back down from anything?
A plainclothesman in a dark alley
with his gun out,
and shots fired...
Look, no one wants to burn
anybody, but the fact is
there's a racial
component to consider.
- The appearance of it...
- Has he seen a lawyer?
Lieutenant...
What?
He's in a situation where
you can't compel a statement
out of him until you
read him his rights
and we haven't
done that yet, so...
I'm his commanding officer.
I just want to know if he's alright.
Okay.
Okay, there's just...
it's a legal question
at this point.
Can I get you anything?
You should call the union, Roland.
Talk to a lawyer before
you say anything further.
I'm not saying anyone's gonna
charge anything criminally.
Everyone knows you had
no intention of...
but administratively...
you need to be careful
because of the racial thing.
You see that, right?
There's gonna be people in the
department who see this that way.
You see that, right?
I wasn't scared, I wasn't angry.
I didn't give a shit
he was black or...
whatever...
or, maybe I did.
How the fuck do you know if
that's in your head or if it's not...
But you saw the gun.
Yeah.
Yeah...
He turned toward me and...
'Cause you shouted, right?
You shouted, "police"
and he turned, right?
I don't think so.
I don't think I said anything.
I don't think he did that.
I was a couple steps in the alley...
and he turned and I saw the gun.
That's all.
He have kids?
A wife?
I don't know.
They won't say.
They won't talk to me about him.
Call the F.O.P.
Get a lawyer, Roland.
No, sir.
I'm done.
Let the lawyer talk for you.
Lieutenant...
tell Lester I'm sorry.
Call the union.
He wants a lawyer
in there with him.
Whenever he's done here, you need
to send someone home with him.
For tonight at least,
he's a suicide watch.
Lieutenant
you'll back him.
What I mean is, if this thing
should turn into some kind of
a black-white thing,
you're his unit commander
he can count on you, right?
Are you alright?
Lo mein.
What a clusterfuck.
How many years on for Waggoner?
Six and a half.
Two commendations, 16th
on the current sergeant's list.
Pretty much the exact opposite
of that goof in there...
you know what's
in that guy's jacket?
Motherfucker flaked out,
shot up his own radio car.
They were gonna charge
him with false report
until Valchek weighed in...
You know he married
Valchek's daughter, right?
Fuckin' goof had nine
lives behind that shit...
Eight up, and the rest
still to be activated
whenever the cellular company
gets to our subpoenas.
You did good, detective.
So we're looking for what?
Looking for one of these phones
to give us signature
on our man, Bodie.
Calls to his girlfriend,
his grandmother...
the numbers we pulled
off the burners.
We see that,
we know it's his phone.
We know it's his phone, we
know he uses it to sell drugs.
We know all that.
We get a tap up and pray like hell
he doesn't throw it
away anytime soon.
Prez would love this...
Ain't gonna lie to y'all.
I don't know about nothing
except the boxing part.
That's all I was thinkin'.
Were you a pug?
Yeah, I was.
I got sidetracked, though.
Well, reverend Reid
seems to think you'd
be quite a draw for some of
these corner kids that we got.
They didn't think so downtown?
Well, the fact is
you're looking to put your
gym in the fourth district
so your council person
would be Eunetta Perkins.
Do you know Ms. Perkins?
Well, few of us do anymore.
Few of us do.
Well, since we can't
really rely on Ms. Perkins,
Ms. Daniels here
will go with you.
She's here because
constituent service
is the life of a city
council person.
She needs to get a taste of that.
At least I hope I do.
If you don't mind me
asking, Mr. Watkins.
Why are you doing this?
Do you know who reverend Reid is?
Well, the voters in my district do.
This came today?
Well, I see, this is fucked up.
I give you a quarter million dollars
to have them tell me my paperwork
is insufficient enough to certify
me as a developer
in the empowerment zone?
Yeah...
Yeah, you could call it fucked up.
Look, I know we touched
the right people.
Just lemme get with them,
clear this mess right up.
Get with 'em.
Hey, I'm on it, String.
You got the lightbulb
franchise, right?
That came through...
now...
I'm not talkin' about
30,000 coming back.
I'm talkin' about the quarter
of a mill that you took.
Now, you need to call
Mr. Goose, Mr. Faucet
whoever the fuck you gotta call
because I gave you money to run
remember that?
It ain't like no
drug deal, String.
Hell, man, you don't put
your money on the street
and have it come right back.
It don't work like that.
Oh, it don't, huh?
Patience, my man.
Sometimes with the bureaucracy
the one hand don't know
what the other is all about.
Yeah, well, you know what I see?
I see one hand in my pocket
while the other hand seems
to have grabbed your dick.
Fucking Prez.
I don't even feel like working.
Sanny, baby.
Welcome to the western, guys.
That thing with Pryzbylewski?
Jesus christ.
So fucking sad, man.
So you humpin' a wagon, huh?
Fuck yes.
How's that working out for you?
Jimmy, I love this fucking gig.
Best thing Rawls ever did for me
was to knock me back to a district.
No stress, no struggle.
I work eight-hour shifts.
I take nothing home with me.
Really, I couldn't be happier.
All those years knockin'
my head against a wall
in homicide and for what?
The same fuckin' pension
with twice the heartburn.
Well, I'm glad you landed
on your feet, Mike.
Hello.
<i>You called my office. </i>
Yeah, I did, several times.
<i>Really, why?</i>
Why do you think?
<i>A sleep over.
You want to get dinner first. </i>
How about tonight?
<i>Georgia Browns near 15th Street. </i>
That'll work.
You want me to make a reservation?
<i>No, I can always get a table there. </i>
Alright, whatever.
<i>Let's shoot for 7:30.</i>
I'll see you then.
- <i>Bye. </i>
- Bye.
You in?
What do you think?
Nice colors.
You got a platform?
Schools.
Thought I'd be the education mayor.
Well, good luck, Tony.
I mean it.
Thanks, man.
When do you announce?
Next month, I think.
You know, get out there
early, start raising money.
In fact, I thought I'd make
the rounds of some people
before then, you know?
Feel them out.
What, Watkins?
Hey, he seems to like me.
You really think Odell Watkins
is gonna split from
the mayor's camp?
What you could do is, ah...
feel him out on an issue or two.
You go in that way,
it's more subtle.
You gotta charm the guy first.
Talk to him about the issues
and then down the road
see if he's willing to throw
sunshine on your ass.
I like that.
We should do that.
We?
I was thinking...
maybe you would ticket
your white ass up with me.
Make a run for Council President.
Me at the top of the ticket,
an emerging black leader
handsome, well-spoken...
you the great white hope
the new voice of civic reform.
We'd give Royce a run, man.
And what makes you think I'm
interested in Council President?
What the hell else you got going?
Think about it.
look at 'em. Like roaches
when you turn the lights on.
What's it look like?
Head and torso.
You got two casings over here.
Hold the call.
So much for the no-violence-
- in-hampsterdam theory, huh?
Herc...
Help me move the body.
What?
Just up the block,
just out of the free zone.
Carv, you've lost
your fucking mind.
Before the ambo gets here
to pronounce him, we can do it.
Why?
Because if homicide gets here...
if they do any kinda canvass...
they're gonna get wind of this
shit on the sixth floor downtown.
- Good.
- Herc, c'mon.
No way, man.
No way.
Fuck those stripes.
Fuck 'em.
Hey Toke, Gil...
help me move this guy
outta Hamsterdam.
I'll be first officer at the scene.
It's my responsibility.
Don't forget the casings.
Make sure that you call me.
I will.
Thank you.
Take care. Bye.
7-60 to kga.
<i>Go ahead, 7-60.</i>
Have 70010-11 me on
Vincent Street below Fayette.
<i>10-4, Vincent south of Fayette. </i>
You say you worked with this guy?
Three shots, no warnings.
He scared of black
people or something?
Shit.
The shit's gone too far.
Yeah, you're tellin' me.
Yeah, I need the number
to the newspaper, "The Sun".
Yeah, the number for the reporters.
The newsroom, yeah...
So, you ain't gonna
say nothing on it?
What is there to say?
Avon, this is blood.
- Family.
- I know it.
An' I'm tellin' you that someone
may have done this to us, Avon.
To our family.
The cop's just sayin' that shit.
To mess with your head.
Exactly.
Why?
That cop don't know me for shit.
What the hell am I to him?
He knows you're gonna
want to think this thing.
That Dee, you know,
he wouldn't do what he did.
I do think it.
Was it some beef he had?
Someone on the inside?
That cop said it was someone
who didn't want you to know
and so they made
it look like it did.
Ain't nobody did nothing.
- But the cop said...
- He's lying.
He paid to lie.
Avon...
you are my brother.
I need to know this
more than anything...
Dee did not roll on us.
He came to the edge, but he
turned around and walked away.
And I know he was willing to do
what he had to for his family.
For us...
but I need to know
that you know that
and you saw him that way.
What...
What you tryin' to say?
If something happened...
The fuck are you even thinking?
That I had something to do with it?
I could do that to my own kin?
Is that what you fucking think?
The fuck is in your head?
I ain't do nothing to Dee.
I ain't have shit to do with it.
To do with what?
To do with what?!
Whatever happened.
Whatever it is that
happened, Brianna.
You think I don't
know my business?
Is that what you think?
I can get him to you
tomorrow morning.
Just let me see
if I can find him.
I'll make good on this.
What'd he say?
They found a blood trail
going back up the block.
So maybe...
Smeared, with drag marks.
And they also found a third
casing at the other end.
Shit.
So what's the deal?
Deal is, we turn this into
a dunker by tomorrow morning
or he starts typing a report
for I.S.D. and the Deputy Ops.
Fuck me.
No, fuck me!
Look, you didn't move
that body, Sergeant.
I moved the body.
Do you understand?
Look, I respect that you did
what you did on behalf
of what I'm trying to do down here
but the responsibility is mine.
So what do we do?
He basically said he wasn't
gonna commit any new resources
though he has placed
it on the agenda
of the coordinating council
on criminal justice
for what that's worth...
Poor Clarence.
He's looking tired.
So we're looking for help
from the statehouse.
If the city could
get a couple 100,000
we could afford an overtime
detail to protect these folks.
I know this is an easier sell
with the mayor involved, but...
could you convince him?
Clarence?
He barely listens anymore...
Jesus, tell me about it.
I been a councilman
three years now
that's a long fucking
time to be ignored.
I'm sayin' the rules got broke.
My people kept their promises
they did what they said and they
were as good as their word.
Y'all...
y'all ain't keep up
your end of it.
Wasn't my people.
Look, I ain't makin' those
distinctions right now.
Fact is, somebody brought a gun
up in the free zone and used it
and both those things
against the promises made.
Now, I can't justify this shit if
I've got dead bodies up in there.
So what I'm sayin'
is this: come tomorrow
if I don't have a
shooter in bracelets
this whole Hampsterdam
affair is over, it's finished.
I'm gonna take my people
back up on the corners
and we gonna fuck y'all
every way we can.
You hear me?
Yeah, it was good
while it lasted, huh?
You had cash on the barrel
and you ain't never
need no bail money.
And hell, I had clean corners
everywhere I looked.
But all that gonna be gone tomorrow
unless y'all bring me my shooter.
You think that'll work?
Do you?
That's good food.
How'd you know about this place?
It was big when Clinton was in.
This and the Red Sage.
Now it's all steakhouses
and cigar bars.
So you live here, but you spend
a lot of time in Baltimore, right?
I have work up there.
And the alumni stuff
with St. Mary's on the hill.
I went to U.M. law, so I still
have connections there too.
Actually, I grew up in Homeland.
Yeah?
Lauraville for me.
Where'd you go to college?
Loyola.
Only one year.
My girlfriend got pregnant so...
so...
so...
so you became
a cop in Baltimore.
How's that working for you?
Oh, it's pretty good.
I do a lot of high-end drug stuff.
Wiretaps.
Prolonged investigations of violent
offenders, that kinda stuff...
In fact is, there's not a lot
of guys in the department
that can do that kinda thing.
It takes a certain...
I dunno, you gotta love it.
Thrill of the chase an' all that.
So, you do what in politics?
I do political campaigns.
Like a campaign manager?
More of a strategist really.
Not so much the day-to-day stuff
but the strategy of how
a candidate can win.
A consultant of sorts.
You strategizing for
anyone in Baltimore?
I shouldn't say.
I mean, he hasn't officially
announced anything yet.
He any good?
Hey, if you're for him,
I'll throw the guy a vote.
What the hell.
Who'd you vote for this time?
What? You mean Bush
and whatshisname?
Kerry.
You didn't vote for president?
I thought about it
yeah, and you know
Bush seemed way
over his head, I know
but he wasn't gonna win
in Maryland anyhow.
And besides, these guys...
it doesn't matter who you got.
None of 'em has a clue
what's really going on.
I mean, where I'm
working every day?
The only way any of these guys
would even find west Baltimore
is if, I dunno, Air Force One
crash lands into Monroe Street
on it's way back to Andrews.
It just never connects.
Not to what I see, anyway.
Hey, that's just me though.
The man Colvin say
he want the boy locked up
or the free zone
shuts down tomorrow.
All she wrote for Hampsterdam.
Colvin.
From the Western.
Shame, who is this kid, man?
Some young boy from Tuckie's crew.
He connected? Kin to anybody?
Naw, he only been on
for a couple months or so.
What he use the whistle for?
Some nigger in one a
ghost Kane's crews
laughed at his shoes.
Do it.
I'll be out in a minute...
No, he needs to put those
in departmental mail.
Yeah.
Whaddaya need?
To turn myself in.
For what?
I shot a boy.
Oh, yeah?

You need another bag?
Yo, Mike, where you at?
Yeah, over here.
Drug war?
Barksdals coming back
on my boy Marlo, hmm?
Shit.
Got it.
Yo man, I don't know where we at.
We are in Baltimore, Lamar.
Baltimore, Maryland.
That's the second crib of mine
them motherfuckers cracked this week.
Stir up a hornet's nest
no tellin' who gonna get stung.
All paranoid an' shit.
Got to be.
They got Latroy.
What the fuck is y'all
on the streets for, man?
Don't you all know there's
a fucking war going on, man?
Get the fuck in the truck, man.
What happened to all them towers?
Slow train comin'.
Reform, Lamar.
Reform.
Reformation
We should be up on
this shit, hearin' voices.
We get a signature number
on Bodie's phone, we will be.
We got enough P.C.
off the burners alone.
Every time these fucking pen
registers click out a call
it screams drug conspiracy.
I'm not the one
takin' the case to court.
Pearlman wants a specific link
to a known drug trafficker.
These drug crews?
They're dumping phones
every couple weeks at best.
So when we do get a wire up,
it's gonna be a limited run.
And dumping phones doesn't
meet the cellular company's
definition of exigent
circumstance, huh?
What's your boss willing to do?
Demper?
He's a bit too focused on next
year's re-election fight.
How about the feds?
They say they can't
do anything for us
and if you look at how they use
the federal communications act
they're not lying.
For national security stuff,
they use the Patriot Act
every thing else gets shorted.
The fact is, the industry
has all of us by the balls.
Pardon my french, Your Honor.
Alright, I'll tell you what.
Best I can do for you is this:
You give me a boilerplate affidavit
with the P.C. from the court report
and then as you get fresh
numbers for new disposables
you call me...
anytime, day or night,
to jump phones.
That helps.
But we're still gonna be getting up
on their phones even
as they're coming down.
Yeah, probably so.
- This is so totally...
- fucked up?
"Je parle français bien,
et tu es trčs charmant aujourd'hui. "
Judge Phelan has you on his mind.
How long has that been going on?
Started with...
my first jury trial
in his court, I think.
I bet you won all your motions.
You wanted to see me, sir?
Have a seat.
I wanna thank you for
the loyalty you showed
moving that body.
It wasn't the most
sensible thing, but...
I appreciate it nonetheless.
You're a good man, Sergeant
you got good instincts
and as far as I can tell
you're a decent supervisor.
But from where I sit
you ain't shit when
it come to policin'.
Don't take it personal,
ain't just you.
It's all our young police.
A whole generation of y'all.
Now, you think about it:
You been here over
a year now, Carver.
You got nobody looking out for you
nobody willing to talk to you.
That about sum it up?
And that's a problem.
And I didn't think
there was anyway
I was ever gonna
get my head around it.
But then Dozerman
gets shot for some bullshit...
and that's when
I 'bout reach my limit.
And that's when the idea
of the free zone
of Hamsterdam come to me.
Because this drug thing,
this ain't police work.
No, it ain't.
I mean, I can send any fool
with a badge and a gun
up on those corners and
jack a crew and grab vials.
But policing?
You call something a war,
and pretty soon
everybody gonna running
around acting like warriors.
They gonna be runnin'
around on a damn crusade
stormin' corners, slappin' on
cuffs, rackin' up body counts.
And when you at war,
you need a fuckin' enemy.
And pretty soon
damn near everybody on every
corner is your fuckin' enemy
and soon the neighborhood that
you're supposed to be policin'
that's just occupied territory.
You follow this?
I think so.
Look, the point I'm makin',
Carver, is this...
soldierin' and policin',
they ain't the same thing.
And before we went
and took the wrong turn
and started with these war games
the cop walked a beat,
and he learned that post.
And if there were things
that happened up on that post
whether there be a rape,
a robbery, a shooting...
he had people out there helping
him, feeding him information.
But every time I come to you,
my D.E.U. sergeant
for information
to find out what's going
on out there on them streets
all that came back
was some bullshit.
You had your stats, you had
your arrests, you had your seizures.
But don't none of that amount
to shit when you talking about
protecting a neighborhood
now, do it?
You know the worst
thing about this
so called drug war?
To my mind?
It just ruined this job.
Major?
What do you got?
Incoming.
"Sunpapers" reporter.
Been to the free zones,
all three of 'em.
It's begun.
I was thinkin', maybe
we rewrite the affidavit
add some of the stuff we're
gettin' from the pen registers
build the case that way,
take it to the judge.
You have a law degree?
If you did, it would
be your call to make.
Who would pretend to be
a lawyer that wasn't?
I'm just saying.
I think we're being
too cautious on this.
We're going the
extra mile for Phelan.
A short cut now could cost us
later in motions hearings.
We drew Phelan on this wiretap?
That two-faced hack sold
me out the last go-round.
Relax...
he's not running for
a new term. He'll be fine.
He's a piece of shit.
We're all pieces of shit
when we're in your way.
That goes with the territory.
Point taken.
So it's these warehouses
the old Winchester homes and the
dead blocks down by Vincent Street.
All three.
And they're just supposed
to let it go on like this?
Colvin told us to push the
street dealing in these areas
then we would start
locking people up.
But so far, not a single
fucking arrest.
And they know about this downtown?
I don't think they have
a fucking clue about it.
But I'd love to be there
when you pop the question.
This is just...
Tell me about it.
Got the place lookin' good.
Yeah.
Now all needs doin' is to go
out and get you some kids.
Come on, man.
You makin' it sound easy
but to tell you the truth
I ain't got no idea how
to go at these hoppers.
I wouldn't lose
any sleep over that.
Nobody else does neither.
We got one.
His grandmother...
<i>Looking for me?</i>
<i>Look, boy, there's no reason
to leave your clothes in the washer. </i>
<i>How many damn times
do I have to tell you... </i>
<i>Gag, grandma, sorry,
I just forgot, okay?</i>
<i>But I did pick up the laundry
soap, I picked it up... </i>
Laundry soap,
that's definitely code.
Now, let's listen to an intercept
we made of Bodie Broadus
when we were up on the pay
phones a couple years back.
<i>I'm tellin' ya all</i>
<i>I saw the boy he sayin'
he ain't got that thing. </i>
Same voice, no question.
I'll let the judge know.
Reference the voice comparison
in the court report.
We're up.
Major Colvin, Western district.
Banisky, "Sunpapers".
So this your idea?
Mind if we walk?
You got dealers
selling with impunity.
Addicts shooting up on the street.
People down here doing outreach,
giving out needles and all.
I mean, who knows about
this down at headquarters?
Command is well
aware of the situation
and while there were
some initial concern
but they feel the cases
that we're gonna bring in...
Cases?
Yeah, prosecutions, sure.
Your officers say no one's being
locked up in the free zones.
My troops are only involved
in pushing the trafficking
to designated areas.
I mean they're completely ignorant
of the investigative aspect
that's run out of C.I.D. downtown.
Yeah?
Who's the lead detective?
Look...
I already said more than I should.
Bottom line is you start
throwing calls around right now
they gonna shit blue
thinking there's a leak.
They gonna come up
on the case early
and we're not gonna get all
we can out of the good work
we did down here.
You're telling me all this
is an enforcement strategy.
What the hell else could it be?
I mean, you think we'd actually
let this happen otherwise?
Come on, Banisky.
I mean, look, look at this mess.
Any other reporter gets on it...
I give it to you and you
run with it right then.
Absolutely.
A week.
But then I gotta run
something no matter what.
<i>Purple Rain, Purple Rain. </i>
It's understood.
So, Brother, what
brought you back?
It disturbs me to leave
business unfinished.
Heard you was shot before
you even got started down here.
Not like you to get played.
Betrayed, you mean.
I am looking for the man they sent.
From his accent he's homegrown,
raised on the street.
Skilled, intelligent.
Late 20s, dark
but with a scar
across his face like so.
You down with this nigger?
I know him.
Not to speak to
but you can't be
anywhere near the game
and not know
the motherfucker.
He with Barksdale?
He with himself.
'Cept for when he runnin'
with a young boy or two...
10 months to the primary,
and you right now
should be all about money.
I know, I know,
dialing for dollars.
You start this week and you don't
stop until you hit your numbers.
We're gonna need a million
just for television.
You really think this is doable?
The odds aren't great, but yeah...
I think it can be done.
As long as the thousand things
that can go wrong don't go wrong.
Even for a white guy?
Even for a white guy.
Speaking of which
I notice a certain
monochromatic effect here.
One thing we're gonna
need is black faces
and we're gonna need them
in prominent positions.
You're right.
We've gotta start thinking about
endorsements by black leaders.
Ministers, community people,
elected officials.
Here comes the hard part:
Splitting the black vote is the
only way to make the math work.
So Tony Gray's gotta
get in the race
he's gotta stay in the race and
he's gotta stay viable in the race.
Guy's kind of a lightweight,
ain't he?
He's a good guy, all in all.
Great, he's a good guy
but we need him to siphon
votes from Royce.
I dunno.
This thing with Tony...
it's not personal, Tommy.
It's politics.
Live with it or lose.
<i>Hey, yo. </i>
<i>That boy with the sharp nose,
he gonna, you know... </i>
<i>he going to the Apollo. </i>
<i>The Apollo?</i>
<i>Yeah, he gonna need two tickets. </i>
<i>Damn, Tweety Bird
workin' that shit. </i>
<i>Motherfucker, how many times
I gotta tell you not to use no names?</i>
<i>Oh yeah, right.
So I holler at you?</i>
<i>Yeah, a-ight. </i>
Apollo, like the theater?
Like 125th Street.
125 grams, one eighth of a kilo.
Two tickets means twice that.
Only new code so
far is Hamsterdam.
Hamsterdam?
We're thinkin' it might have
something to do with the stash house.
Well, I'm gonna hook up with Kima,
cash the Tweety Bird meet.
You're happy with
what we're getting?
Another week of calls like this
and we'll have their network
fleshed out and plenty
more phones to go up on.
I need a moment with the detectives.
Sure.
I.I.D. picked up Prez's shooting.
It's to be expected.
The racial thing alone is tense
enough that they gotta react.
No luck at all to that boy, huh?
For the supervisor's report
I need to ask if either of you
had any indication that Prez
harbored racial prejudices.
Well, he harbored
some weird shit, no doubt.
But I never got a racial vibe.
Lieutenant, you seriously askin'?
Not to start no shit
but you think Waggoner
gets shot if he's white?
Description called
for a number one male.
I'm just sayin'.
The good lord set sunday
mornin' aside for church-goin'.
Even kenny bird and peanut,
when they was warring,
had the good sense
to respect the truce.
You know them
Barksdales sent a hat?
A church crown?
Walked up, rang the bell,
and set it down on her porch.
'Cause they shamed.
Is Miss Josephine mendin'?
She bruised up still,
but she a-ight though.
But you ain't.
Not until I settle this for good.
Hey, yo, Butch, I want you
to go inside my bank
and spread the word:
Omar payin' cash money to get
at them people, ya feel me?
Save your money.
Come now, Butch,
I got to do this, yo.
I'm sayin' you ain't got to pay.
Thomkins, up on McCulloh.
What the funeral home?
You mean to tell me, all this time,
you had a scope on them clowns
and you ain't let loose
a mumblin' word.
Caught myself lookin' out for you.
Fact of the matter is,
your chances of goin' up
against that mob and comin'
back is as slim as a garter snake.
I can't help that now, Butch.
The fuck?
Where's my people?
Slim Charles pulled 'em.
Hired new muscle.
Slim Charles?
When the fuck did he...
How's the count?
Down bad for the
third straight week.
And the shelf-life
of the shit we got
it ain't gonna last, String.
I know.
Slim said they was to stick
to you for protection.
Nice shot.
Dribble it back out.
Dribble it back out.
Get your dribble on.
Hey, yo, easy, easy.
Y'all just hacking my man up.
Foul machine.
Nice drive.
Kinda unschooled, ain't they?
Is that observation meant as
just a casual curbside fuck-you
or are you lookin' to step up,
maybe help out here?
I'ma give it a try.
I'm lookin' to get some
kids interested in boxin'.
Boxing?
Look here.
This is my time-out corner.
Where I send children
who can't play nice together.
Listen up, this man's
starting a boxing program.
And from the looks of some of you,
signing on might be a good thing.
Gonna need it.
Only thing he know
how to do with his fist
is wrap it around his cock.
Fuck you, man.
I'm gonna kick your ass.
Come on, motherfucker,
you ain't shit.
Yo, sit down, sit down,
come on, ease up.
Sit down, sit down, come on,
man, sit down, man, sit down.
My man...
my man, you droppin' your right.
You see, if the youngun there
was trained, he'd whip you.
Look like he was the one got beat.
Stand up, let me
show you something.
Come on, man.
I ain't gonna hurt you.
<i>Yellow Tops, Yellow Tops,
got them Yellow Tops. </i>
<i>Yellow tops. </i>
See that?
Alright, sit down.
Look, if y'all want to learn more
I got a gym down on Gilmor
in the old tire plant.
You're all welcome.
Alright?
I saw Tweety Bird parked up there.
Now all we got to do
is wait for the re-up.
I hope these fucks don't dick 'round
and make us sit here all day.
What, this eatin' at you?
No, I'm good.
Yeah, I can see that.
Remember that woman
I was talking about?
The politician woman?
How's it going?
It ain't, it turned to shit.
Feel like I don't even belong to any
world that even fucking matters.
'Cause you're a cop?
Naw, it's not just that.
It's like, I went to meet her once.
She was in a hotel
room, the top floor.
I punch the button on the elevator,
it doesn't even go there
because you have to have
some fucking special key
to even get to that
special fucking floor.
So I go to the front desk, some
sneering fuck call upstairs
gimme permission to go get laid.
I listen to the shit she talks about
and for the first time in my life,
I feel like a fucking doormat.
Like anyone with
any smarts would
do something else with
his life, you know?
Earn money or...
get elected.
Like I'm just a breathin'
machine for my fucking dick.
I'm serious.
I'm the smartest asshole
in three districts
and she looks at me like
I'm some stupid fuck
playing some stupid game
for stupid penny-ante stakes.
She fuckin' looks through me, Kima.
Stay in the car, man.
But the tall man said
to stick to you like...
Tall man gonna be there when
I'm stomp on your fucking head?
Stay in the car.
Yo, make it short, man,
I got a meet to make.
Oh, fuck the meet!
You harder to get at than
my fat wife's cunt, nigger.
Yeah, you high and
mighty Barksdales
can afford to sit back
and play low key,
But some of us gotta work
for a got-damn livin'.
What you think this mess
ain't fuckin' up our business?
That mean Avon's willin' to sit
down and talk with Marlo
work this shit out?
Well, if that don't happen,
String, I got you some bad news.
Me and the boys had us a sit down.
Got a quorum an'
took a vote that says...
if y'all don't quit this war
we of a mind to shut you out.
And when I say out, String,
I mean out the package.
The boys don't want
to extend the good shit
if it's gonna keep you and your
peoples out on them corners bangin'.
What about the boy?
What the fuck he say?
Vinson say Marlo willing to talk
if he can keep his corners.
Now, hear me on this,
String, we ain't no ingrates.
We all recognize your
contribute to the co-op.
But the feeling is this:
it ain't right for you to be
at the head of our table
when you can't call off your dog.
Call it a crisis of leadership.
You're gonna tell 'em?
Got to.
Between the health care
workers, the reporter
my own pissed-off troops,
it's gonna come out.
Either tomorrow, or the next day.
Then we should make a few arrests
make it look tactical.
Naw.
You know what happens if we start
lockin' people up in Hamsterdam?
The whole rest of the district
goes back to being a shithole.
Naw.
If Rawls is gonna hand me my ass
at least give me a chance
to tell the man my story first.
Devonne.
It needed doin'.
<i>Somebody just got shot. </i>
What you want I should give the
snitch that clued us to the denali.
I mean we didn't
get Marlo, but still...
No, he kept his end up.
Go it all.
Avon, I need a word, man.
A- ight, get them
things out of here.
Check it out, String.
This shit got a kill range
of like 50 meters.
Slim got this from some soldier
comin' back from wherever.
I spoke to Prop Joe's people.
They think we can work this out.
A sit-down?
It's the perfect time
for it, man, I mean...
you done represented yourself, man.
Your name ringin' out
now that you done
taken Marlo down
a notch or two, man.
So why not quit while we ahead.
Just let me get this
thing right, man
then, you know, we get
back to business as usual.
They gonna cut us out, Avon!
Prop Joe and them niggers,
man, they took a vote.
They gonna cut us out.
We ain't gonna have that dope,
so even if we win, we lose
'cause we ain't gonna have no product
to put on those fucking corners, B.
Avon, look at you.
Fuckin' shooting dope without
a fucking needle right now, man
getting high on a power trip,
playin' fucking soldier.
Yo, you gotta sit back, man,
think about our business.
What the fuck you want?
That motherfucker, he good.
What happened?
You know, Avon, you gotta think about
why we got in this game for, man.
Was it the rep?
Was it so our names could ring out
on some fucking ghetto
street corners, man?
Naw, man, there's games
beyond the fucking game.
Avon, look, you and me,
we brothers, B.
We ain't think we make it
this fucking far, but fuck
if we ain't standing here
right now, with the
whole world at our feet.
The whole world, man,
not these fucking corners.
The whole world, B.
You know what Slim just told me?
Devonne come up dead.
She was shot one in the
mouth, one in each tit.
You still want to
talk truce, String?
You right when you say I need
to learn more discipline.
But this...
you could do this better...
You're the perfect bait, Lamar.
They'll see you as conflicted.
Your homophobia is so visceral.
You see that?
I ain't even stepped
inside the joint yet
and you callin' me
a cocksucker already.
You in the right place?
I'm lookin' for someone name Omar.
No last name.
Scar across his face an' shit.
Scarface named Omar.
Sounds different,
but I can't help you.
You drinking?
Maybe you wait four years.
No, it has to be now.
It's gotta be a three-way
and Tony's gonna go this time.
I'm just...
Tony's my oldest
friend on the council.
Well, couldn't you
go talk to him first?
Put it on the table?
You know, may
the best man win...
Truth is...
he can't win alone
against Royce, either.
He's got the bumper stickers,
but not much else.
Wants to run on education.
I mean...
where do you go with that?
If I level with Tony and he
gets out, then I can't win.
I need him in the race.
I feel like shit.
I really do.
Don't look like much.
This some weak ass
shit right here.
Hells yeah.
Man, we got lockers,
you got gear.
It's all peelin' and shit.
Go long.
Pass it here.
You gettin' me all dirty and shit.
What's wrong with you?
Fuck you, bitch.
We clocked the meet with Tweety Bird,
stayed on him overnight,
tracked him to a possible stash house
and then home to nest in Woodlawn.
Got photos, his tags...
What happened?
They ditched their phones.
The D.N.R.S and the wire all
died around three o'clock.
We were on line just shy 30 hours.
I thought we had them on their
burners for a couple of weeks.
Not anymore, it's a week at best.
We just spent $9,000 and
change for 18 intercepts.
Five of them non-pertinent.
That's close to $700 per drug call.
Until we see which way this goes
shouldn't we get back
on Bernard and his girl?
I mean, get a line on
the new phones at least.
But that'll only give us
what we just had: 30 hours.
Anyway to get ourselves
ahead of the curve?
If there were some way
to pre-wiretap the burners...
What then?
Stick 'em on the rack
at Baba whatever's
and wait for Bernard
to show up that day?
The problem is the wireless people.
They claim it takes
a minimum of four days
to process a court order
and that's only after
I had my office threatened
to go public on them.
Four days to hit
a couple of keystrokes.
Bullshit.
What if...
no way.
I know what you're thinking.
I just thought the
same fucking thing.
Alright, look, man.
You wanna take your
left foot out, man.
Hey, unc's playin'
wit my man's feet.
Yeah, he smellin' up my ass, too.
Stop with the damn clownin', man.
How you gonna learn somethin'
actin' like a damn fool?
Ain't no big mystery why
your face got tattooed.
Shit, that man can't
talk to you like that.
I seen his ragged ass up
the spot, copin' vials.
Yeah, probably pimps his ass, too.
Listen, motherfucker.
Yeah, bitch, touch me.
Touch a juvenile, see what happen.
Let's bounce.
Bitch ass.
Faggot.
Chump ass.
Lester.
First time I seen him smoking.
Tough habit.
And pacing like a motherfuck, too.
Heavy is the head
that wears the crown.
<i>Bay Wireless Connect 411.
What city and state?</i>
Baltimore, Maryland.
<i>How may I help you?</i>
Baltimore police.
<i>Any particular department?</i>
Western District police.
<i>Is this mergency?</i>
Non-emergency.
Man, they just did you
with the bum rush.
That's what they do.
They past expert at pluckin' nerves.
You just gotta remember,
they barely house broke.
I'm tellin' you, man,
you wouldn't believe it.
They was all wild and shit.
Wouldn't listen.
Andre, I want you to crowd him.
Yes, sir, crowd him.
Alright.
Time!
You gotta set your
mind to stick with it.
When those two stumbled in here,
they was wilder than wild.
Now they comin' everyday.
Yes, sir, no, sir.
Still pretty rough
but you know with the right
breaks, they gonna make it.
How?
Try as they might,
I don't let 'em fail.
You do that, it messes
with their mind.
Pretty soon, they run out
of their little bag of tricks.
What you think of that?
Pretty weak.
Ain't weak.
That's the startin' point...
Naw, naw, I can't
put a name on him
but I seen him 'round.
He's off a west side.
He ain't no drug dealer,
less he doin' it on the Q.T.
You can't go at him, game him?
I don't know, Kima,
I mean, it be pressin'.
What about her?
Squeak.
Offa Lanvale.
Yeah, she used to boost
for Turtle Wells', old mob.
She lost a little bit of weight too.
I mean, lookin' a lot
better than I remember
and I remember a lot
about that girl.
Damn, Bubs, is there anybody
westside you don't know?
Jus' citizens an' shit.
My C.I. knows the girl.
He can work her?
If it's smooth, yeah.
Check this.
That's Western District?
Stringer's calling the Western?
Maybe he's surrendering.
After all the work we've done,
I'd never forgive the sonofabitch.
Go down. Go down and out.
Sweet!
I got hands.
What's up?
My knuckleheads didn't post?
They did, but they left.
Over here.
You lookin' for
a discount, old man?
Naw, but I'm lookin' for you.
Why somethin' come up missin'?
Came past to apologize.
I'm new at this coachin' thin'.
An' I got us off on the wrong foot.
I ain't gonna leave it between us,
you thinkin' I gave up on y'all.
Motherfucker's memory weak as shit.
We the ones bailed out on him.
Anyway, I'm here now.
Let me understand:
You want to sell drug traffickers
a series of cell phones
that are pre-approved
for telephonic intercepts.
And you want me
to sign off on court-ordered taps
on a bunch of phones that
at the time I am signing the order
have not been used for any
illegal activity whatsoever.
If you're looking for
precedents, your honor?
There aren't any.
It's circumstantial P.C. at best.
What the hell, let's do it.
Let the court of appeals sort it
out, if it even gets that far.
Quite the legal mind.
Buy you a drink?
Why the fuck
you comin' up behind me?
Sorry.
Bushy Top.
You called, I didn't know if
I'd find you here so late.
Just getting ready
for COMSTAT tomorrow.
So what's up, Major?
Your unit is still working...
a drug war, right?
Working it hard.
Does the name Avon Barksdale
do anythin' for you?
He's a player?
He's the main guy.
We thought he was down,
but he popped up in september.
You add him to the equation,
it goes a long way
to explaining the violence.
So it wouldn't be
a stretch if he got shot?
You heard he got shot?
You know when or where?
I could run it out quick.
Naw, ain't gonna make no difference
he didn't post up at an
emergency room from what I hear.
Major, I'm gonna be straight with you.
We're runnin' wires into his people
but we're barely
above the street.
So far, we haven't even
put an eyeball on him.
Suppose to be layin' his head there.
I need you to check that out,
get back to me as soon as you can.
You got a C.I., huh?
You wanna see if your
man's creds are bonafide.
Don't try to play me, Bushy Top.
I didn't say male,
I didn't say female.
Alright.
I'll get a surveillance
goin' right away.
According to my source,
Barksdale's name is on the paperwork.
No shit.
You get the confirmation on
that, call me back on my cell.
Good luck tomorrow.
Yeah, right.
Sham.
Shamrock.
Run these over to Levy for me.
Tell him I want a read on it.
A read?
Fresh eyes.
Tell him I'll call him tomorrow.
A- ight.
Come on, Mr. Bodyguard.
And so, we're gonna
come at her like that.
So you gonna give me
these phones to sell?
The money comes back, Bubs.
All of it?
- Is that Beadie Russell?
- Looks like.
Whoa, yo, you can't
turn from this lane.
Sweet Beatrice Russ...
I was just gonna say, "hey. "
North and Pulaski.
The photo was taken at four P.M.,
prime time for street-level dealing.
That is Riggs and Calhoun.
Mount and Fayette.
Edmondson and Brice.
It's your old foot post, Deputy.
I know where it is, Major...
what I don't know and
very much want to know is
where is the west
Baltimore drug trade?
I hope, major, these are not staged
photographs you're showing us.
No, sir, they are not.
No, Deputy, I found another approach.
I'm all ears, Bunny.
I moved them off the corners.
Goddamnit, don't be coy
with me, Major. I can see that.
What I want to know is how the
fuck you managed to move them
and where the fuck they are now.
Deputy
I don't know quite
how to put this, but we...
I mean, I...
I began by identifying those
areas of my district where
drug trafficking was least harmful
I proceeded to push all street-level
dealing towards those areas.
Now at first
dealing with the juveniles
on them corners, had little success.
But ultimately
by rounding up all the mid-level
dealers in my district
and making an offer
they couldn't refuse
- I was able to...
- You made them an offer?
Yes, sir.
Either they move their people
to one of three designated areas
where drug enforcement was
not a district priority...
or they face the wrath of every
able-bodied soul in my district.
Major, I don't understand.
The only time we can
hold a drug corner
is when we assign
officers to stand there.
Your slides don't suggest any
concerted deployment on any corners.
How were you able to...
Jesus christ, you nit,
don't you see what he's done.
He's legalized drugs!
Actually, I elected to ignore them.
You lost your fucking mind.
He's lost his fucking mind.
You. In my office. Now!
That's it, gentleman.
She's a go.
Showtime, Bubs.
Oh, shit.
Sister Squeak.
Bottom-end Bubbles.
How you stand, girl?
Been a long time.
T- shirts?
<i>What the hell kinda
money is in t-shirts?</i>
<i>Girl, you just don't know. </i>
<i>But how's your game?</i>
<i>I heard you was locked up. </i>
<i>Shit, I been on paper for a year. </i>
<i>- I got some things going.
- I can see that. </i>
<i>You look good. </i>
How's he doing?
He'd talk a cat off a fish cart.
<i>A-ight, Bubs, I gotta get. </i>
Alright, I see you later on.
Yo, Squeak, Squeak.
I 'bout forgot.
I can sell you one
of these, real cheap.
If you got use for the shits...
I'm fuckin' dead.
You mean, we're fuckin' dead.
We're all dead behind this shit.
Jesus christ.
What I did, I did knowingly
and on my own.
My men had nothin' to do with this.
They thought it was part
of some elaborate trap.
So if you need me to fall on
that sword, I'm good with that.
You're good with it?
Hey, you know I got my vacation time,
my last 30 in a couple months.
So, if you need me
to fall, I'm ready.
But don't let me hear
that you're taking
any punitive action
against my people.
Because I can get on the soapbox
and I can lie as good as
the next man, if I have to.
Are you threatening me?
I believe I am, sir.
My apologies.
Bunny, you cocksucker, I got
give it to you, a brilliant idea.
Insane and illegal, but stone
fuckin' brilliant nonetheless.
After all my puttin' my foot up
people's asses to decrease
the numbers, he comes in
and in one stroke, gets
a fuckin' 14% decrease.
Fuckin' shame it's gonna
end our careers, but still.
You're all probably tired
of hearin' from me, but...
I brought these.
Letters...
from community associations,
ministers, business people, citizens.
And they're all positive.
They're all happy that the
dealers are off the corners.
You think that's
gonna save our asses?
Do you?
No, I guess not, but...
that and my badge is all I got.
I might have your badge,
Major, but not today.
I don't want to draw any attention
to this shit before we're...
ready to speak to it.
So if you have any vacation
time, you're taking it now.
Do not report for
a shift until notified.
Oh...
one more thing, sir.
A "Sun" reporter is
aware of my deployment.
I told him an investigation
was pending
he promised to delay the article.
How long?
About a week, tops.
I was with Superstroke on the
pool circuit in the early days.
But mostly pickpocketin'
and short cons.
I did the long distance access card
heist before cell phones got popular.
You crept numbers?
Yeah, I favored the airports, yeah.
Can you still read numbers?
What's up with this?
Your man thinkin' I brought
him bad merchandise?
'Cause if that what he think,
we can beat feet right now.
Damn, Bernard, why you
actin' all C.I.A. and shit?
We tryin' to make money here.
If you had to answer
to the people I do
your ass would be damn
more sight cautious, too.
That's all I'm sayin'.
I appreciate caution.
'Cause I'm hangin' out here too.
Give it a go.
Use a cell phone.
Marlene, you send
that copy off to Paris?
Thank you, darling.
That will work, I'm at the airport.
The shuttle, yes...
three, one, oh, double four, eight,
sixteen, ninety-one, double seven
eight, three, one, two.
Now that last number might be a seven.
I'm not too sure with
these small keypads and all.
We can do business.
That's it.
One two, one two, one two.
One two, that's it.
One two, there you go.
Alright, there it is.
Now you gettin' it.
Keep that left hand up.
Hey.
Hey.
Alright.
Watch your balance now.
Don't lean forward.
Don't lean too much, don't
lean too forward, alright?
Alright, let's go. Don't lean
too forward, that's right.
One two, pivot...
You're kidding.
Tell me he's kidding.
You're kidding, right?
He did it without our knowledge.
Without your knowledge.
Well, that's worse.
You're the Commissioner...
Was the Commissioner.
You think the buck's gonna stop
in this office, you're wrong.
If I might, these are letters
from people in his district.
Ministers, business
people, voters...
all glowing reports.
And there's the 14% reduction
in crime, in the Western.
That's not an anomaly.
It's hard data.
Now, we can clean it up,
make it go away.
The press might already
have wind of it
but we can explain that as
some sort of a new initiative.
Trap high-end drug dealers...
14%?
If we handle this right, we
might all get out from underneath.
No mud on anybody.
No, no.
I trusted you, Erv, I really did.
You let me down.
Now, this thing goes wrong,
no tellin' the damage.
On this, you walk point.
That's the way things work, Erv.
You know it as well as I do.
Thank you, Ervin.
I'll be over shortly
to see the detailed plan
on how this shit gets
cleaned up immediately.
If you could call this shit
something other than what it is...
Don't even think it.
Way it works is this:
If you don't re-up the minutes
on your cell phone before 60 days
the wireless company
recycles the phone number.
And that's where I get them.
I put the word out on the street
that I'm buying tossed-off burners.
Payin' two dollars a pop.
Street people bring me hundreds.
I bring 'em in here to my niece
she jiggles the computer
juices them up another 200
minutes on a bogus account.
And that automatically extends the
life of the phone for another 60 days.
She charges me 20
on each phone on her end.
I double it or more
on the street to make mine.
So what you sayin'?
Baby, a standard
Trac phone, with two
maybe 400 minutes on it
gonna run you 150, 200, easy.
I charge you an even 100,
you clear 50 on each phone.
That's if'in you can back
them up with receipts.
I gotta show receipts lookin'
like they from different places
or I can't play.
Can we accommodate the good man?
Damn, Calvin, you know
I got the bingo tonight.
Look, friend, I ain't sure
you want to be around here.
And I'm damn sure we're
gettin' tired of havin' you.
That plain enough?
You should know by now
I don't wanna be 'round no
bunch of cocksucking faggots.
But I ain't gonna stop coming
round till I run up on Omar.
You might want to get the word out.
For the last time,
I don't know him.
Then I'm back tomorrow.
Maybe I can help you?
I don't doubt it for a minute.

That's far enough.
Drop your laundry
and turn slowly.
So, you gonna
rob me now?
I need to remind you
who I am?
Omar, isn't it?
Pull it slowly.
Then toss it.
Oh, I will move slow.
But I ain't tossin' nothin'
bow tie.
So whatever you gonna do
you might as well go ahead
and make it quick.
I knew you'd come back.
I trust you didn't
lose sleep over it.
Worryin' about you would
be like wonderin'
if the sun's gonna come up.
I ain't about to wild out over it.
What I want to know is
how you find me?
Your boy, he didn't
give you up easy.
Ain't sugar-water runnin'
through them veins.
- You kill him?
- He's resting.
I see you favor a 45.
Tonight I do.
And I keeps one in the chamber,
in case you ponderin'.
Nice show piece
you got there.
Walther PPK.
380, double action.
Hear them walthers
like to jump some.
As will you,
with one in your elbow.
That gun ain't got enough firepower
to make my joint useless.
It definitely won't stop me
from emptyin' out half my mag.
- You might not hit me.
- This range?
And this caliber?
Even if I miss,
I can't miss.
I admire a man
with confidence.
I don't see no sweat
your brow neither, bro.
I suppose we could
stand here all night.
S'pose we could.
Or settle this
once and forever.
I want to ask you something... brother.
Omar listenin'.
Middle Ground
<i<I'm going up the west. </i>
<i>A-ight, me, too.
A- ight. </i>
Here we go.
<i>Yo, I need some
face time with the man. </i>
<i>Hold up, I'll holler
back at you, man. </i>
That would be Shamrock.
Assuming Stringer Bell is the man,
now we wait for the return call.
This is beautiful.
Lester, can you actually
believe we fucking sold
the wiretaps to the targets.
For a week at least.
Maybe we duck the bullet.
Maybe we clean this mess quietly,
throw some horseshit at
whatever reporter shows up
and the Mayor
forges and forgets.
We're ready to move on this, right?
As soon as we get the word,
we shut down all three zones
toss everyone into wagons.
There'll be nothing left
of it before midnight shift.
So what the fuck are we
waiting on for a day and half?
Why isn't the Hall calling us?
Commissioner Burrell
for Mayor Royce.
- I've heard enough...
- Hold on, Coleman.
Come on, let the man talk, huh?
Excuse me, Mayor. I have
Commissioner Burrell on the line.
- He says it's urgent.
- I'll bet it is.
He wants to move, Clarence.
He wants to clean this shit up
yesterday, and so do we.
Tell him to hold.
- Go ahead, gene.
- Look
I'm not a politician,
I'm an academic.
All I know is that from a
public health perspective
there are remarkable things
happening in the free zones.
Needle exchanges, on-site blood
testing, condom distribution.
Most of all we're interacting
with an at-risk community
that is largely elusive.
We're even talking some of these
people into drug treatment.
And that's just what U.M. and
Bon Secours have brought to the table.
If this thing were sanctioned
my department could put
public resources into play.
You people can't
see the forest here.
Odell?
When the story breaks, the ministers
will surely be against you.
And most of the City Council
will be walking sideways
away from your administration.
And my guess is the Governor
and the legislature
will use this opportunity to piss on
the city from a great height.
And Washington?
Oh...
Can you imagine how far
the United States
Department of Justice
is gonna crawl up
your ass behind this?
Crime is down, Odell.
Medical people are
telling me this could work.
I mean, a 14% decline
in felonies citywide
I might be untouchable on this.
Now, look, we need to think
see if we can keep
this thing going without
calling it what it really is, huh?
- Jesus.
- Now, there's got to be a way.
I want you to talk this thing out.
Hey, Erv, thanks for holding...
Yes, but...
Yes, I understand.
Then I'll wait
to hear from you.
We're to hold off
on any action in Amsterdam.
No arrests, no movement
until further notice.
He says he wants to regroup.
Determine the most
effective course of action.
Translate that for me, will ya, Erv?
I don't speak his fucked-up lingo.
Royce is figuring a way to put
all of us in the guillotine
and keep the blood from
spraying anywhere near the Hall.
Shit, I'll be goddamned if
I'm gonna go out like that:
Bent over in public.
I can spin the story just as
well as that motherfucker.
- You're gonna go to the press?
- Not me.
But I know a slick little bastard
who will happily
put Hizzoner's shit in the street.
Somethin' funny 'bout that?
'Cause I look in the paper and I see
all these federal grants comin' down
but nothin' for B-and-B.
- You're expecting what?
- Payout.
A big payout for what
we put in, man.
Federal dollars on them
Howard Street rehabs.
- You gave money up front?
- 250,000, yep.
To Clay Davis.
How you know?
What you sayin'?
He's runnin' game?
Naw, hell no, he ain't that brazen.
Lemme guess.
He told you about the faucet.
Or was it the goose
that laid the golden egg?
You ever actually
meet the man?
Did you ever actually see any of
your cash reach anyone in authority?
Yeah, I met the guy
at the federal building.
Yeah, I met him.
Yeah, what office?
He came down to the lobby.
he rainmade you.
A guy says if you pay him,
he can make it rain.
You pay him. If and when it rains,
he takes the credit.
If and when it doesn't, he finds
reasons for you to pay him more.
Clay Davis rainmade you.
Naw, man, he got them building
permits in no time at all, man.
I mean, we bribing
these motherfuckers.
He got the city
contractor's money back.
- How much?
- 35,000 so far.
- On a quarter million you gave him?
- It's for bribing the motherfuckers.
There are no bribes!
You really think
a state senator is going
to risk his salary
and his position
by walking into a federal office with
a briefcase full of drug money?
I seen Chunky... Chunky Coates.
Chunky Coates gets his grant money
same way everyone does.
He fills out applications,
he makes sure the plans meet spec
then he prays like hell.
This is an old game in this
town, and Clay Davis?
That goniff was born with
his hand in someone's pocket.
I just wish you'd have
run it by me sooner.
Now here's Shamrock
returning Bodie's call.
<i>Talk about it. </i>
<i>Yo, the man said he'd see you,
same time as always. </i>
<i>You know the spot. </i>
During the first call, Sydnor had eyes
on Shamrock over in West Baltimore.
Alright? Now look at this.
At the time, Stringer Bell
was at the print shop.
So it couldn't be
a face-to-face meet.
We didn't catch a call between
Stringer and Shamrock.
How can that be?
Stringer's phone isn't on the same
network as everyone below him.
- Right you are, ma'am.
- Bell's not using Bernard's burners?
And Shamrock has a separate
phone for calling Bell.
We can't hear those calls because
the system's compartmentalized.
Some tricky motherfuckers.
A week or so up on Bernard's phones
and we'll have everybody
up to and including Shamrock
tangled up in conspiracy counts.
But Bell or Barksdale?
Not unless we can pluck their
cell numbers out the air.
Where you headed?
Toy store.
He legalized drugs
in special zones?
It's more
than that.
Major Colvin lost
the necessary perspective
that is required for command.
We were all under pressure
to reduce crime before year end
and he responded poorly
to that pressure.
Pressured by who?
Mayor?
I'm just explaining to you
that the pressure was applied
all down the line
from headquarters
to the district commanders
to the shift
and sector supervisors.
So Colvin's 14% decline was bullshit.
And they're selling drugs
with police permission in Western?
The department is ready to shut that
mess down with mass arrests.
- I'm on top of it.
- Why don't you move?
The Mayor says wait.
Why?
I think he's gonna
make some kinda show.
Spin it so that
I take the weight
for something that has
nothing to do with me
and everything to do
with the pressure
that my commanders
are getting from City Hall.
Going public and putting the
responsibility for this
back at City Hall is the only
move I have left, right?
I mean, I spin Royce
before he spins me.
- And you want me to...
- Not you.
Your pal, Tony Gray.
If he's gonna take a run at Royce,
he's gonna need ammunition, right?
I don't have a relationship with Gray.
I do have one with you.
And Councilman?
You owe me.
- What's up, hotshot?
- I got a technical question.
Remember those
analog units we used
to use to pull cell
numbers out of the air?
The C.F. something-something...
Yeah, Cell Frequency
Identification Device.
- The triggerfish, yeah.
- That one, it could flag a number.
Right, but the old analog machines?
We used to have to
follow the guy around
stay close while he used the phone.
New digitals...
bing, we just pull the number
right off the cell towers.
So, you got any down out at
Woodlawn that daddy can borrow?
- What about yours?
- What?
City has three of 'em,
I remember right.
Homeland security
grant sent 'em to you
every big county department
in the state.
No fucking way.
Thanks.
- I doubted you, Tommy.
- I told you it was big.
If we play it right.
He wants me to turn the
information over to Tony Gray...
and let him use it, he figures if
Tony's running against the Mayor
he'll take aim at Royce
and not the department.
We may want to bring
Tony in on it
keep him viable
against the Mayor.
But right now, you need to find
out what this is all about.
Firsthand... do you know
this, Major Colvin?
To shake hands, maybe.
If Burrell's painting
him the villain
Colvin might be anxious to tell
someone his side of the story.
McNulty, Major Crimes.
Sullivan, minor irritations.
You got anything back there that's like
the old C.F.I.D. but digital?
- For catching cell numbers?
- Catching who?
You know, a triggerfish machine.
Triggerfish. For cell numbers.
How 'bout I look around
there on my own?
Yes, this is Councilman
Carcetti over at the Hall.
I'm trying to reach Major Colvin.
<i>I'm sorry, but
he's on vacation. </i>
I'm aware of that, but I'm trying to
reach him on municipal business...
<i>Well, I could put you
through to his voice mail. </i>
No, not his voice mail. I said I have
to reach him immediately...
- <i>Immediately?</i>
- Right...
- <i>How about his cell phone?</i>
- His cell, it'll be fine...
<i>Alright. Four-oh... </i>
Alright, that's enough.
Yeah, I know, it hurts.
But your fists gonna
be like rocks after awhile.
Justin, c'mere.
- Alright.
- I want you to push me on my chest.
You ain't got to do it hard.
That's how you was standin'.
You ain't have no weight
on your back foot.
That's right.
No center of gravity.
Plus, if you get your stance right...
then you got the means
to put your hip into the punch.
Bub-bub, right?
Bub-bub.
That's where your power come from.
Yeah, but what happened
when we get hit?
- Say what?
- We get hit
even with this pad,
you gonna get trucked.
All this stuff fallin' apart.
Yeah, the heavy bag, too.
Yeah, where you get this stuff at?
The Town of Bedrock?
Naw, he said nobody. So you
gonna have to wait right here.
What you mean wait right here?
You know who I am, boy?
Man say he want
to see Avon...
Makin' me wait
to see my own partner?
- He new, String.
- Fuck that.
Lotta new faces round here, man...
Way too many, you ask me.
Get the fuck out of here.
- Where Avon at?
- He'll be along shortly.
That's good 'cause
I came to see you, anyway.
What you need?
I need you to hit somebody.
Who we hittin'?
- Clay Davis.
- The Clay Davis?
Downtown Clay Davis?
That suppose to mean
somethin' to me, man?
- That nigger need to be got.
- Shit, String, murder ain't no thing.
But this here is some
assassination shit...
Look, I tell you you gettin'
somebody, you getting him.
- I ain't askin'.
- Damn, String, I don't know...
Nigger, I got to remind you
who the fuck you work for?!
Hey, yo. I think Slim gonna have
to sit this one out, boss.
So you gonna hit a
state senator now, huh?
Yo, you kill a downtown nigger
like that the whole world
gonna stand up and take notice.
I'm talking about the state police,
federals, all of that.
You need a day-of-the-jackal
type motherfucker
basically to do
some shit like that.
Not a rough and tumble
nigga like Slim.
- That nigger took our money, man.
- I seen it comin'.
Well. He got to go.
Naw, you a fucking businessman.
You'd wanna handle it like that.
You don't wanna get all gangster
wild with it an' shit, right?
What I tell you bout playin'
them fucking away games?
Yeah.
They saw your ghetto ass
comin' from miles away, nigger.
You got a fucking beef with them?
That shit is on you.
So... we aim this
at the nearest celltower
the one that would
be the conduit for calls
coming to and from our boy, Bell.
And...
we let rip.
Fucking hell.
Look's like Baltimore white pages,
without any names.
But the pattern trace
will pull that down.
You know, if we know the approximate
time of Bell's call
we can start just by pulling calls
off that tower, at that time.
That could be thousands.
Yeah, that's the baseline,
but we get a second hit
- and that list comes down to dozens.
- And after a third or fourth...
then we've got his number.
I can't believe that this was just
sitting over at I.S.D. gathering dust.
We're going to be on these
motherfuckers for real now, Lester.
They don't know about
this technology yet.
For once they can't
change and adjust.
It's genius.
Oh, happy day
when jesus washed
oh when he washed
he washed my sins away.
You need something?
How much you make?
What?
On them tees?
How much you make?
A fair profit.
No more than that.
You should probably sell
sweats with hoodys.
Since the seasons changin' an' all.
Where you live at?
<i>Yellow Tops, Yellow Tops,
got them Yellow Tops. </i>
Bodie Broadus.
The man with the hands.
I heard was, um, openin' up
a gym or somethin'.
Yeah, tryin' to.
I'm lookin' to get up with Avon.
- Thought you was out.
- Man, that's why I'm came to you.
I mean, I feel like
the way we left it
I can't just roll up
on the man, you know?
hey, yo, it's me.
Yo, I got that hitter here with me.
Yeah, the soldier
that walked in and out.
Yeah, he want to see the top man.
You slam shit like that
you gonna fall out one day.
I'm good.
I'm tryin' to school you, boy
and you just don't wanna know.
I'm cool, Huck.
I'm good.
<i>Whitey sale,
whitey sale. </i>
One for three,
three for five.
<i>Whitey sale, whitey sale. </i>
<i>Whitey sale, whitey sale!</i>
<i>Alright, so what you
want me to tell the man?</i>
<i>Yo, I'll give word up
and then I'll hit you back. </i>
Shamrock.
4:40 P.M.
B- and-B enterprises...
- <i>We need to have lunch. </i>
- Alright, hold on, I'll call you back.
- Yo.
- <i>It's me. </i>
It's good.
Yeah, it's me.
<i>Yo, tell the hitter, tell him
the tall man pick him up. </i>
- <i>Right. </i>
- 4:47.
A seven minute window.
There's 892 phone numbers.
That's our baseline.
- We're on our way.
- Yep.
Stay the fuck there, man.
Yo.
Jimmy! On the clean phone.
He just hit your friend's number.
The one off the business
card you gave me.
- The Western?
- His cell.
Should we be worried
about this?
Naw.
- A boxing gym, huh?
- It ain't a proper one yet.
Why I asked to see you.
So, what you know about takin'care
of something like that?
Not a damn thing.
But I know that sweet science.
And I got some kids
who are interested.
What I got a need for,
bro, is equipment.
Man, these kids
gonna get rained on.
They need headgear,
they need guards, cups
you know, so they
can take the hit.
Shoot, you know what
I'm sayin', man.
I seen your picture on them
globe posters back in the day.
Undercard shit, maybe, you know.
Yeah, but still,
you was golden gloves.
For a minute.
But I had a physical defect.
What, you had a glass jaw?
- Nah, forehead, nigger.
- Cranium shot'll do you wrong.
Yeah, look here, man.
You seen new heavy bags?
Look, freestandin', man.
All you gotta do is add water.
Then you got speed bags,
right there, right?
You got this headgear
right here. It's new.
Look, protect the cheek
and the chin.
You know.
And I know I can go around and
collect a dollar here, dollar there.
But I'm trying to put together
a select group of people, right?
I call them my,
my gold circle club
and they gonna make
a substantial contribution
and just get
this thing rollin' right.
I mean, I'm gonna put their name and
picture up on the wall in the gym.
What you tryin' to get
me to join a club?
Naw, man, I'm just sayin'.
There's all sorts of levels.
We got the, the silver club,
we got the bronze club.
Man, for motherfuckers who really
don't want to dig that deep.
Come on, man, check it out.
Nah, man, I ain't got no time
for this bullshit, man.
You know I don't want
my fucking name and face
on no damn wall.
You crazy, nigger?
How much money you talkin' about?
$10,000.
I see you go through
all that for 10,000?
Man, slim, go get him $15,000 cash.
Yo.
Shit.
A- ight, then.
Hey, you take care
of them little niggas, hear?
No doubt, bro.
- Yeah. Yo, you talk to him?
- <i>Fat man wanna parlay. </i>
- Alright, you good, hook me up.
- <i>Yeah, a-ight. </i>
You check out what I sent you?
Yeah, your information was good.
So, we can talk on the
real side now, huh?
<i>Tell your man
I'm good for tomorrow. </i>
<i>Yo, I'll hit you back. </i>
- Now we're cooking.
- Cutting butter with a hot knife.
Next time Stringer Bell takes a
call off the baseline he's ours.
Game over.
So, it ain't what
it might seem to you.
That man there
is my brother.
But if it keep on
like it been, then...
You got problems?
I stirred up some shit
with this Hampsterdam mess.
That's 'cause
you was behind that
that made me come
to you with this.
Look like you and me both tryin'
to make sense of this game.
Speak your mind, Russell.
You two good?
Yeah.
We got y'all out front.
Let's go, p-square.
You look healthy.
For a man who was gutshot.
You reached out to a third party
who engaged me in the purpose
of holding your towers.
That third person's word
was your word
as he represented you.
That's right.
And I ran those
East Baltimore gentlemen off.
I held up my end
of the agreement
at least for as long
as I was physically able.
You did.
Your man then set up
a meet at Butchie's bar.
Your man told Omar Little
that I was responsible
for the torture of a young boy
who was close to Mr. Little's heart.
Your man
in effect
sought to have me hit.
Omar told you that?
And you believe that motherfucker?
He doesn't strike me as
a man who would tell stories
even at the point of dying.
Shit.
Proposition Joe package.
The inner workings of your
organization don't concern me.
If there's a way,
I mean, if my man...
if he made
a mistake here
then I'm willing
to pay the cost.
How can we fix it?
You want money?
Money?
Yeah, this is business.
Business is where you are now.
But what got you here is
your word and your reputation.
With that alone, you've still
got an open line to New York.
Without it, you're done.
If my man's still on paper.
I can put him in a spot
that got heavy artillery.
I ain't talkin'about pistols.
I'm talkin' about
mini-tech nines,
shotguns, they even got
grenades in that motherfucker.
That's an automatic fall.
So, I'm hopin' you could
keep that shit to five.
Look, if you hit the joint
his people are gonna try
and take the wrap for it.
They gonna say all
that firepower is theirs.
So all you gotta do is just hit
him with the parole back-up.
Look, I can't make no promises.
- It's gonna be a nickel, at least.
- Come on, man.
- Him and me...
- I'm gonna do my best, alright.
He's always at this place?
Naw, he come and go.
But it's the spot
since the war started.
He musta done
something to you.
Naw, it's just business.
Almost forgot.
This came in for you last night.
Said she called your cell phone,
but you didn't answer.
She had a nice voice.
Like a kitty-cat.
We're on.
<i>He say for you
to be there, half-pint. </i>
<i>Yeah, okay. </i>
Stringer Bell, that's him.
- There it is.
- Yeah, but for how long?
He could toss that
burner at any moment.
I got Rhonda,
you raise Daniels.
Okay.
Ronnie, yeah, we're
on Stringer's phone.
Lieutenant.
- You should go straight to the judge.
- I'll meet you there with an affidavit.
- Lester's raising Daniels.
- McNulty's calling Pearlman.
Watch that footwork, baby.
Alright.
Take it to him now.
Take it to him now.
I'm a beast, coach.
Alright, boy, don't
be gloatin' on it.
Yo, when we gonna
have some real fights?
You know, one of them
tournament things.
Yeah, we gladiators, son.
Y'all got more fire than skills.
You ain't ready for
no full-blown thing just yet.
But I don't know, maybe it
be good for you all to spar
with some boys you don't know.
A nigga step in my house,
he gettin' dropped.
I met these fellas at that gym
over on Pennsylvania Avenue.
I'll see if
they wanna roll through.
A- ight?
A- ight. A-ight.
You don't return
a councilman's calls?
I'm off this week.
Taking a little
accrued vacation.
Yeah.
And I heard why.
I'm here for your side
of this story.
If I can't get that,
then whatever comes out of
Burrell's mouth is gonna stand.
You good with that?
What did you do, Major?
And why the fuck haven't
they shut it down?
We've seen that law enforcement
steam roller approach
is just spitting in the wind.
I really think that you're
onto something here, Clarence.
But if you keep it up
before you know it,
they'll be calling you the most
dangerous man in america.
Well, I know it may appear that
we're vulnerable here, huh?
But if we enforce the drug laws
everywhere else in the city,
aggressively
how can they say we're not
a law-and-order administration.
Now there's got
to be a middle ground here
that we have yet to find.
There's got to be some way
to accomplish this
without turning
everything upside down.
This used to be one
of my worst corners.
This is the neighborhood
where a cop got shot
last summer, right?
Dozerman.
Looks quiet now.
So do most all my corners.
G- man.
So, what's up?
Shut the door.
In 10 minutes we're gonna
have an affidavit
for a city judge to sign:
It's for Russell Bell's dirty cell.
It's a good pull.
It is if Bay Wireless doesn't
take five days to process it.
You owe me, Fitz.
That whole port case
came down early behind
some ugly shit in your house.
Now, I don't care how you do it,
but I need my wire today.
These guys were in radio cars
two months ago
chasing calls, clearing corners.
I pulled them to do
felony follow-up.
More police work, less bullshit,
and that's why my crime is down.
My numbers are true.
What'd he do?
Church burglaries,
14 of 'em.
Let's go.
Mademoiselle.
Is it aff-ee-ant
or aff-I-ant.
I've never been
clear on that.
You been hunting this guy Bell
for a long time, haven't you, Jimmy?
A while, yeah.
Name's familiar to me.
That the thing that we did
a few years back, was he the...
yeah.
What's done is done, Jimmy.
Now, for your own fucking sake,
just let it go.
Come on.
As the affiant
do you solemnly swear
and attest that the information
contained in this document...
That's the most sign
ificant dropin crime in this district
in recent history.
We still got some hard lookin'
boys out on them streets.
An' Sergeant, them
little mini-motorcycles
they keepin' me up at night.
We're working on that.
I have been livin' in this part
of the city my whole life.
And I can tell you something.
We weren't any angels
when we were kids.
And those are hard boys you
talkin' about, half of 'em
they just playin' gangster.
They no different
from what we were.
Shirts and drawers
a little longer, is all.
The one thing I do miss
about my neighborhood
I'm talking about the
neighborhood I came up in.
See, we knew the police.
See?
We had a white police officer,
our house was on his beat
on his foot beat
and he would be sitting out talking
to my mother damn near every night.
I mean just sittin' out
on her stoop just talking.
And I'm telling you, this man,
his name was Frazier O'Leary.
He even knew
my grandmother by name.
Yes, ma'am.
Now let's move on to the
tip-line information...
I'm so sorry, baby.
I'm real sorry,
but I was not finished.
You see, let me
tell you something.
I have not seen that
face-to-face policein'
in a long while.
In a very long while.
Until last week.
A young officer, black officer,
came by my stoop, I was sitting out
gave me his card.
His name was Reggie Ballard,
is his name, right?
And he said,
and he talked to me.
We just talked.
And see now I know
his name and face
and he knows
my name and face.
You see?
And I'm going to tell you something.
That is how it should be.
My son wants to open up
one of them snowball
stands on the street.
Do he need
a permit for this?
You ever seen a Westside
community meeting like this one?
In fact, folks downtown
at minor privileges
tell me that stands aren't allowed
in the citywide way at all.
Now they do say it is possible
to have a snowball stand
behind the sidewalk...
Why are you really
down here, Councilman?
I mean, this ain't
even your district.
I'm interested.
I have the Public
Safety Subcommittee.
See that buding there?
Was the old Stryker building.
It was a funeral parlor
the last stop before the cemetery
for Westside white folk
back when there were
still some of those around.
Right 'bout the time that...
Jim Crow was breakin' up
back in the early 60s
somebody ask
old man Stryker, they say
"Stryker, you gonna change your
policy and start buryin' black folk. "
And Stryker said
"yeah, on one condition:
If I can do all of them at once. "
That's sick.
You know somethin'?
I had a lot of
respect for that man.
'Cause, unlike most folks
I always knew where he stood.
I'm doing my job.
Look, I done showed
you the good.
Come on, let me show
you the ugly.
Hey, how come so quick?
Stringer Bell's given name?
Russell.
For now.
Achmed.
We're on the top
of the mountain.
<i>Come get 'em,
come get 'em. </i>
This is it?
One of three.
How did you
make this happen?
I just did it.
I got tired of hearin' folks
talk about what needed
to be done or...
what they would do
if it were up to them.
<i>Got them bottle rockets,
bottle rockets. </i>
So, what, this is about
you making a mark?
Nah, I ain't analyzed it
all that deep.
I ain't claimin' no kind
of victory, neither.
I will say,
I'm glad I tried.
Go on, Councilman.
I'll wait for you down here.
You're not comin'?
What you're gonna
see ain't pretty.
But you're safe.
<i>W.M.D'S.,
Got them W.M.D'S.</i>
Think you need to take
this journey your ownself.
<i>Yellow tops.
Yellow tops, right here. </i>
I ordered one for you.
Thanks.
Surprised I called?
A little.
After the way we left it.
I'm a type-a, Jimmy.
People like me break things.
When I slow down, or when I take
a minute to think about it, I...
Is that your idea
of an apology?
I didn't drive an hour
up 95 to apologize.
I missed you.
I missed you,
too, I guess.
Still, seems like a long way
to come just to tell me that
then turn around
and drive back down to D.C.
I'm not driving back tonight.
So what's goin' on?
You working on a case?
It's a good one.
How about you?
Anything interestin'?
I did hear a crazy
Baltimore story
you know through
the rumor of Washington.
Really?
Some...
renegade police commander
takes it on himself to
I dunno, legalize drugs
in the precinct.
Mayor doesn't
even know about it.
Can you believe that?
Crazy story.
Someone...
I think it's Colvin.
You know him?
No, I can't say that I do.
Still, I think
it's funny that some...
water-cooler talker down in D.C.
Knows any Baltimore cop's name.
I was just wondering.
Listen, I'm...
- You're leaving?
- Yeah, I think so.
Goodnight.
Damn, man, I miss
this crib already.
Yeah, well, you spendin' a lot
of time at the other spot
doin' what
you gotta do, huh.
Yeah.
Man, it's a shame we got to deal
with this Marlo bullshit, man.
I mean if I had taken
care of that earlier, man...
There's always gonna
be a Marlo, man.
No Marlo, no game.
But you coulda dealt
with that shit a little sooner.
I mean, yeah, but
you know what I'm sayin'
don't let it lay
on you like that.
Tonight, I mean, I'm gonna kick
back and just enjoy this view.
I mean, look at this shit.
Can you fucking
believe this?
I mean, I got a crib
that's overlooking the harbor.
This is the same place we used
to run through this motherfucker.
We had every security
guard in there...
following us.
As they should have.
True, true.
And then there was
that one time...
Toy store.
Hell yeah, I told your ass
not to steal the badminton set.
What you gonna do
with a fucking net
and a racket and we
ain't got no yard.
Uou like, "yo, that white boy
ain't gonna jump over
that counter
and come chase after me. "
He sure did, though.
And he said, "whschooooo".
I said, "what the fuck... "
He was on your ass
like Carl Lewis.
Fist was rolled up.
Your ass was runnin' too,
fast as you could.
Punching yourself in the chest
looking all mad an' shit.
That shit was crazy, man.
Right here, too, man,
right there.
Goddamn.
Can you imagine, man, if I had
the money that I have now, man
I coulda bought half
this waterfront property.
Goddamnit.
Forget about that
for awhile, man.
Just dream with me.
We ain't got
to dream no more, man.
We got real shit
real estate
we can touch.
I can't get too
fucked up tonight, man.
I got some shit I gotta
do on the site tomorrow.
Plus, the fucking polack
we got working for us, man
I gotta pull his coat.
If he had anything to do with
that Clay Davis bullshit, man
I'm gonna have to cut
his money, little faggot.
What time y'all meetin'?
What time, 12...
I think, why?
You need me to do
something for you?
Naw, just seeing where
you going to be at.
You need to relax
more, man.
All in time, is right.
I will.
You know I don't take
my work... too seriously.
That's right.
It's just business.
Us, motherfucker.
To us, man.
Hit him, Andre,
go get him.
Come on, Spider.
- Alright?
- I'm good, I'm good.
Alright.
Alright, Ditty, you up.
You, Justin.
C'mon, boy, I'm callin' your name.
Alright, listen up, we're gonna
have three two-minute rounds.
Watch the low blows.
Touch gloves.
And...
Let's go, Justin.
Come on.
That's good, that's good.
Come on, man.
Block that.
He leadin' left
and punchin' right, Justin.
Move towards his weak side.
He only come up
to your waist.
Oh, man, bell.
That was a quick two minutes.
Yeah, I know.
Get you some water, boy,
and spit it out.
You alright?
Dizzy.
That's why the hell I keep
tellin' you got to breathe, boy.
So, what?
You had enough?
Nah, I'm good.
Alright, alright.
- Let's go, Justin.
- Let's go, Justin.
Jab, Justin, jab.
Hey, we're up.
Here it is.
<i>- It's me, man.
- You heard from the fat man?</i>
<i>Yeah. </i>
<i>We low, right?
One mark shy of the mark. </i>
<i>Yeah, it's light. </i>
<i>Cherry says it's light. </i>
<i>Well, tell the man
I'm doin' what needs done. </i>
<i>A-ight, I'll tell him. </i>
<i>- Oh, an' that other thing...
- Huh?</i>
<i>Them two hitters
you asked after. </i>
<i>They good with it. </i>
<i>Not on the phone. </i>
That's it.
We got!
Good work.
I guess this is pertinent.
Ain't no need
to go back out.
You ain't got
to prove nothin'.
Shoot, my momma hit me
harder than that.
I still got a chance,
he gettin' tired.
Drink and spit.
Ready.
You more than ready, boy.
You a game rooster.
Let's go, Justin!
Is there an alley entrance?
Boarded up on both sides.
We gonna have to go
through the front.
That's a change
for you, isn't it?
You just be ready, bow tie.
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Breathe, boy.
Breathe.
Touch gloves.
How I do?
You still got
plenty to learn.
But on the heart side?
You did good.
Go on, soldier.
You done for today.
Oh, I can see it
all clearly now.
Between you and them subcontractors
and that motherfuckin' politician
you all had me
in a spin, right.
- Mr. Bell, I don't know...
- Little man!
We gonna get all
this shit sorted out.
And hey, if the shit
don't come up right
one way or another
you gonna pay for this shit.
Look, I understand you're angry
but at the same time you can see
the progress we've made in here.
Progress.
Now I honestly don't know what
passed between you and Senator Davis.
But if you're unhappy
with Clayton's performance
then you have
to work that out...
Oh, shit.
Oh God.
Oh, God, no.
I ain't strapped.
Look, man, I ain't involved.
I ain't involved in
that gangster bullshit no more.
What you niggas want, man?
Money?
Is that it?!
'Cause if it is, man, I can be
a better friend to y'all alive.
You still don't
get it, do you?
This ain't about
your money, bro.
Your boy gave you up.
That's right.
And we ain't had
to torture his ass, neither.
This seem like...
I can't say nothin'
to change y'all minds.
Well, get on with it,
motherfuckers!

- Who's got the scene ?
- Massey and Crutchfield are working it.
Norris is on his way to the morgue.
He'll beat the bodies there.
He's getting the full treatment, boss.
We're good there.
Just one witness so far.
You know what that means.
Right now it's all BNBG.
It's Andy Kraw's
big adventure.
Mayor's office already called twice,
worried sick about the man.
You're kidding me.
That's a whole lotta
campaign contributions
sitting on the back of that ambo.
So what's the scene say ?
Two shooters. Shotgun, semiauto.
One vic is a West Side soldier
with a pretty healthy sheet
the other is a major player
in Daniel's wiretap case.
So a hit.
Drug related.
With a big time developer
in the middle ?
What's the fit ?
Second vic, Russell Bell
owner and co-developer
of this here.
And other downtown
real estate.
Well propertied man,
he was.
But you were aware that Russell Bell
was regarded as a major
narcotic violator.
Well, how do you think
he made his money ?
I didn't inquire.
You never got a look
at either of the gunmen.
I told you. I saw only the one of them.
He was black
big, I thought,
with a large weapon.
BNBG.
Big negro, big gun.
Two more
like it upstairs.
Yeah.
Have ballistics rush comparisons.
Drug-relateds for the last six months.
I caught him, Bunk.
On the wire. I caught him.
He doesn't
fuckin'know it.
Mission Accomplished
Boxing, yeah.
I know
you loved that.
Ugh, I hated it.
I hated watching it.
Yeah,
I know you did.
So you're
doing good, huh ?
Day to day, I am.
'Cause I was thinking
maybe...
I'm proud of you, Dennis.
Be well.
Shut that
fuckin'door.
Man, fuck it.
I'm ready for this shit.
These niggers are snappin'on us.
You see ?
Do you believe this fucking shit ?
Some shit like this woulda never
happened with the old Barksdale.
Yo, Slim, man.
Say the motherfuckin'word.
Shit is on.
'Sup, B ?
You a'ight ?
We gonna bounce back
on the motherfucker, no question.
Bounce back on who ?
Marlo, boss.
Oh, he gonna fall.
Marlo, Marlo ain't got
shit to do with it.
Marlo couldn't
get String like that.
String died'cause of some other shit.
What ?
He died because
of some other shit, nigger.
I couldn't fix it.
I tried.
That nigger String was
right about this shit, man.
That nigger was right.
Fuck Marlo. Fuck this fucking war.
All this beef over
a couple of fuckin'corners.
Don't matter who did
what to who at this point.
Fact is, we went to war
and now there ain't no going back.
I mean, shit
it's what war is, you know.
Once you in it, you in it.
If it's a lie
then we fight on that lie
but we gotta fight.
Got this out of his pocket.
I got no idea.
It's a cell chip from a phone.
What elsedid you get off him ?
200 cash, set of keys, license.
President Street address ?
I got Landsman bangin'out
a warrant for the place.
Fuck the politics for a minute.
What if the man happens to be right ?
Legalizing drugs ?
Crime is down in his district and
people on that side of town,
they're okay with it.
Look, if you don't exist,
what happens here ?
If there's no Tommy Carcetti
in this thing,
what's likely to happen ?
The mayor and Burrell,
they shut this thing down.
I figure the Mayor's
trying to find a way
to shuit down to make it look like
it was an enforcement plan
in case it goes public
otherwise he'd have
moved to end it already.
Makes sense.
But no matter what
Colvin's little experiment
is finished.
Come on, Tommy.
They dealt you a winning hand
and you're acting like you
forgot how to play.
Mr. Mayor, call it legalization
and my office can't live with it.
Agreed.
No one can.
But harm reduction.
That could sell provided there's a
reduction in the crime rate.
Harm reduction.
Sounds good.
Steven, what if we were
able to suggest
limiting our
street level enforcement
we were concentrating our resources
on high-level traffickers.
How would that play ?
Well, if I could show off that kind
of casework, yeah, maybe.
But they've been doing
street rips for so long now
I don't think
a high level exists.
What if we were able to say
that no major traffickers
were allowed in the free zone...
That the major violators
were still being targeted, huh ?
Are you suggesting
some kind of admissions
criteria for the zones ?
How would that work ?
I don't know that it would.
I'm just saying that for
the sake of public perception.
Come on, people,
work with me on this thing.
<i>Fucked up, ain't it ?</i>
<i>Marlo need to get his ass
dropped, him and all his crew. </i>
<i>They gonna fall.
You'll see. </i>
<i>All right, let me know. </i>
That's the word
on the wire, anyway.
Every mention puts it
on Marlo Stanfield's crew
which means the war's
gonna ratchet up, no question.
Where's Jimmy ?
He went with Bunk Moreland
to rifle Stringer's spot downtown.
- How'd he take it ?
- Like Stringer was kin.
- Yeah ?
- <i>Bushy Top</i>
- <i>need to pull your coat up. </i>
- Hey, what's up, Major ?
<i>I got somethin'for y'all.
Mount Vernon Square in about an hour. </i>
I'm there.
This is Stringer's ?
Yeah.
Who in fuck was I chasing ?
What's done is done.
Gay ass gangsters.
Please.
I took it for as long as I could.
Let's go, man.
Let's go.
It being your town, I trust you
to do it proper.
You off today, boss ?
Every day, at this point.
I told 'em over at COMSTAT
about my little experiment.
Bosses went crazy, huh ?
Anyway, that's why I called you.
That there is a wartime lay-up
for your man Barksdale.
My sources tell me the man's there
most of the time
with a lot of muscle :
sawed-offs, semiautos, Mac-11s.
Whole lot of good shit
if you hit it right.
- That's a hell of a tip.
- Shit.
That right there might be
the last bit of police work
in a long and storied career.
I'll talk to you, Bushy Top.
Which one is Ali ?
In the white trunks, boy.
- Damn, he look young.
- He was.
This the Patterson fight
right here. Old school.
Who Patterson ?
He soft.
Ali whippin'his ass.
He was a champ too.
Look, any man still standing
at the end of a round
you can't call him soft.
That's a rule, all right ?
From Stringer's place downtown.
B and B shit, college papers,
real estate stuff.
There's no phone extension
in the place, just these.
Cell phone chips. 'Bout 100 of them.
So that's why he wasn't
taking any phones
from our man Bernard, huh ?
Stringer had his own phone
he just changed the number every
time he changed the chip.
Shamrock too, probably, with
whatever phone he used to call Bell.
Cautious man.
Yes and no.
Have a look in here.
All different manufacturers.
Before Stringer Bell got aced
he went out of his way to put in
his good friend Avon Barksdale.
That's a Barksdale safe house.
Where'd you get this ?
Colvin.
- Calls to the Western.
- Where's Daniels ?
He's got this thing downtown.
It's for his wife.
You should raise him.
It's not enough
to make up for Stringer.
It'll do for now.
Because the neighborhoods
and the residents
in this district are among
the poorest in our city.
And it is these residents
who most need
a strong voice at City Hall.
Time has come for a change.
<i>And I believe I can
bring about that change</i>
<i>by providing a strong voice
for the new 11th District</i>
<i>if you will do me the honor... </i>
It's kind of cool, the lieutenant's wife
running for office, you know.
<i>Well, as you just heard,
West Baltimore City</i>
<i>Council woman Eunetta Perkins
is going to have her hands full</i>
<i>in next September's
Democratic finals. </i>
Stringer Bell.
Damn.
Who could have got to him ?
I mean, if it wasn't y'all on it.
You know Avon's gonna
put it on you, right ?
Shit, let him take it
on my jacket.
Don't make me no never mind.
I'm thinkin'it might be what
you call one of them good problems.
Yeah.
I heard Colvin's
in deep shit downtown.
Looking at this right here
he might not be the only one.
Anything comes up,
I'm on the radio.
My man, my man, my man.
Yo, you think I could get like $5 ?
- I need like $5 to get on the bus.
- I look like a tourist to you ?
- Man, I swear to God.
- Lookin'like that
walking into
an open-air drug market
why the hell would
I think you'll spend my $5
on bus fare ?
Shit,'cause I already
got my blast, man.
All night you been drinking
like your ass is candy.
That's shameful shit.
12-gauge pumpkin balls.
Last time I saw that kind of load
was the Pimlico double
and I fuckin'know that motherfucker
was in the middle of that mess.
And if I remember your boy
he had no love
for the Barksdale people.
Execution style, that don't play
like Omar Little.
Besides, the word on our wire
is that Marlo's people did Stringer.
- Marlo Stanfield ?
- The heir apparent.
This city's going to hell, man.
We're gonna push past 300 murders
before New Year's.
Shit is fucked.
Oh, hey, Cheryl.
No ? My guess is she's, uh,
picking up a prisoner.
Yeah, I spoke to her
about ten minutes ago.
Yeah, well, they make you
check your stuff.
Cell phone, money, weapon.
Well, she'll call
when she gets the message.
Not at all.
I need more, Jimmy.
More !
Motherfucker.
I'm tired, Bunk.
Let's go.
I heard the vanguard met.
Heard they voted to have a
civilian review board look at it.
It wasn't unanimous. And there were
people there speaking for you.
I heard that too.
So six out of ten black officers
think I'm just an asshole racist.
On the other hand
four out of ten
think you're just an asshole.
It's an administrative charge.
You can fight it and win
if you want.
Failure to properly identify myself
as a police officer.
Sounds like what I was guilty of
most of my career, actually.
I'm not sure
I was supposed to be a police.
Not really.
What were ya supposed to be, huh ?
This is from Major Colvin's CI ?
What's the corroboration ?
Well, the source knew that Barksdale
had a waterfront condo in his own name
gave the accurate location,
and title info
down to deed of transfer.
Well, that's good, but it puts him on
the legitimate side of things.
What corroboration is there
for illegal activities ?
Sorry I'm late.
I had to stop in at a friend.
The source knew that Barksdale
was shot last month
wounded in the shoulder.
- Emergency room ?
- No, no hospital reports.
We're gonna need better.
Either Colvin goes back to the CI
or we sit on this address for a while.
- we can see.
- Well, fuck it, then.
Let's name the source.
Put him right in the affidavit.
- It's Colvin's call, isn't it ?
- It's Stringer Bell.
Lester figured it out from the DNRs.
Bell was snitching out Barksdale.
- You're sure of this ?
- Maybe that explains the murder.
What's in the wire ?
Loose talk about how
it was Marlo's people
but nothing past rumor.
With Bell gone, Barksdale might
have to come down a notch
to oversee the day to day, and
maybe that puts him in contact
with some of our
monitored cell phones.
If he's as cautious
as Stringer, maybe not.
My guess is Barksdale
never touches a cell phone.
Safe house might be our best shot.
All right.
We stay on the wires until
this batch of burners
goes dead, hoping
we have Barksdale
but meanwhile, we get a warrant
for that safe house
and wait on him there.
Thanks for the cover last night.
This is Greggs, Major Case Unit.
Who's the shift leader ?
Holy Christ.
- <i>They're all over it, Commissioner. </i>
- Right
That was Foxtrot.
The cameras have found our
little shit pile.
Your fuckin'councilman
took his sweet time, didn't he ?
Everyone's a critic.
If this doesn't go, what line
of work are you gonna try next ?
We're here in West Baltimore...
For more than a month, police
from Baltimore's Western District.
It's just an outrageous development.
It's something I never thought I'd see
from this or any other administration.
Frankly, this is one of the
reasons we need a change
in leadership in this city.
Did the Mayor know ?
What about the Police Commissioner ?
These are questions for the
Mayor and Police Commissioner.
These are central issues
of crime and safety.
The Royce administration
is simply bankrupt.
You still gonna announce
for mayor next month ?
Standing here today
looking at this ?
I can't see I can do anything
but put it out there right now.
All I can tell you is that
for more than four weeks now
the Baltimore Police
Department surrendered
portions of the police district
to the drug trade
and the Council was not informed.
Fuck me. I fuckin' had this story
all to myself a week ago.
<i>Police officers for weeks
have turned a blind eye... </i>
What the fuck was I thinking ?
<i>.. sanctioning open-air
drug markets. </i>
'Scuse us.
<i>... in the so called free zones,
drug dealers routinely ply... </i>
Mr. Mayor,
Commissioner Burrell is here.
Tell the Commissioner the Mayor
will be with him shortly.
<i>And young children run
the streets alone. </i>
<i>The inhabitants of what
has come to be known</i>
<i>as Hampsterdam have little
to say for the camera. </i>
<i>But channel 5 has learned
that the police were... </i>
Yeah ?
<i>What are you seein'?</i>
Coupla people in and out.
No sign of Barksdale, though.
<i>It's quiet here too. </i>
Okay.
Need to look at the back.
Our friend Carcetti's gonna
run wild with this.
And from the sound of things,
Gray is gonna run with him.
Tony Gray thinks he's gonna
get my chair behind this bullshit
We're throwin'you out
of the boat, Ervin.
This shit is on you alone.
Not necessarily.
Not if I talk about how
we were under pressure
to keep the crime down
to juke the stats
district by district...
You never said that.
About how Colvin under pressure,
lost his way
about how I came to you
weeks ago...
- Days ago.
- Weeks ago
to tell you what he had
done and to assure you that
we were on top of the situation
that Colvin would be relieved
and his plan aborted.
You lyin'motherfucker.
But you heard about the drop
in Colvin's felony rate
and you sent me packing.
Brought in your liberal-ass
do-gooders to seriously consider
this horseshit
while Colvin's
mistake grew and grew.
My hands were tied, Mr. Mayor
my department thwarted.
I was a prisoner
of the goddamn politicians.
Or...
I leave your office right now
willing to say a lot less than that.
I put what I can
on crazy-ass Bunny Colvin
and I take the hit.
And if Carcetti or Gray holds hearings
I'm the wall between them and you.
In which case, I am your commissioner
for the full five-year term.
Unit one to unit two.
- Unit two standing by.
- Deal's made.
Unit two to sector three,
move on the Winchester Homes.
<i>Ten-four. We're moving. </i>
Unit two to sector two.
Move on the Koppers plant.
<i>Roger that. </i>
Over the top, gentlemen.
'Bout fucking time.
Man, g outaigo re-up.
- Where Tuckie at ?
- I don't know.
- Yo, where Tuckie at, man ?
- He rolled out.
- He said the police comin'.
- D'oh.
- Here they come. Let's roll.
Hold it right there
White jacket !
Stop right there ! Stop !
Freeze ! Police, don't move !
<i>Outstanding, red team.
Oustanding. </i>
<i>Give you a case
of beer for that one. </i>
Son, this nigga Stringer Bell, man
was beggin'Chris, yo, for real.
Like know what I mean ?
Diggin'in his pockets,
talkin' 'bout how much cheese
he gonna give us, I mean,
if we just let him walk.
My man Chris holler,
"Man, bitch, you gonna die. "
This nigga just dropped
to his fuckin' knees like
a little cocksucker,
man, start cryin'.
That shit was worse
than fuckin' pathetic.
- Yo, that's Marlo.
- Get on yo'burner, man.
<i>- Got a line on him.
- The number one ? Where at ?</i>
<i>Tall man says
to tell y'all to soldier up. </i>
<i>They up at the rim shop. </i>
- Boss, you okay ?
- What you want ?
Slim said they got
their eye on Marlo.
I'm just sayin', you know,
all the boys, they all waitin'on you.
Go ahead, man.
I'm behind you.
What else you need
from us, Deputy ?
City Hall wants
the bulldozers through here
at dawnand then fencing
all around the site.
Winchester Homes
and the Koppers plant as well.
We got it.
Come tomorrow,
the television reporters
get nothing they can
stand in front of.
'Scuse me, Deputy,
sir, we found a body.
Any trauma ?
Can't tell for sure
with all the rat bites.
Take him to OCME
in a jail wagon.
I don't want the fuckin'
reporters seeing any ambos.
Shit.
<i>He just landed. Him plus one. </i>
Got it. Sit tight.
That makes how many ?
Including Barksdale, Sydnor
counted ten in
and one comin'out,
so that's ten at least.
2301 to KGA.
<i>Go ahead, 2301.</i>
We need QRT to meet us at our 20
for a search and seizure.
Location has multiple suspects
and may contain automatic weapons.
<i>Ten-four. </i>
Word travels fast, huh ?
Shit.
Burrell called Johns Hopkins
personally this morning.
Dragged your name into the gutter.
Johns Hopkins doesn't
need the notoriety.
The chief academic officer of a
major research university
doesn't want to hear
that some new hire
makes up the rules
as he goes along.
Yeah, Colvin.
COMSTAT tomorrow.
I'm up.
Y'all taking a door ?
Where's tactical ?
I called for QRT.
You ain't heard ?
They're a little busy tonight
tearin'down Colvin's fuck up.
With all that goin'on,
you're lucky you even got us.
- Who he hittin' on this ?
- Avon Barksdale and crew.
I fuckin' told you he was out.
Did i fuckin' tell you?
I fuckin' told her.
<i>For more than four weeks,
the Baltimore Police Department... </i>
By tomorrow, the story goes national
and Washington reacts.
Save the best
questions for Tony Gray.
He needs to shine
even more than you.
I can't believe
he wants us to knock.
Well, you can' flush
guns, now, can you ?
Well, fuck that.
What if they open up on us ?
These guys are
at war with another crew.
We go chargin'in there,
chances are we will get lit up.
Yo, B.
Sham sayin'that Charles
sayin'they still up at the rim shop.
Marlo, his boy Chris,
and Vinson, they still eatin'
but the rest of the muscle,
they rolled out.
<i>Police !</i>
No.
Not the police.
- Narco's out back too.
- Shit.
<i>Let us in !
We know you're in there. </i>
<i>Open the door,
you fucking cocksuckers !</i>
Fucked up, man.
Y'all ask me
y'all ugly ass niggers
shouldn't be in here
fucking around
with all these guns and shit
Open it.
<i>Come on, Avon. Enough with this shit.
Open the fucking door. </i>
<i>Open the fucking door,
you cocksuckers. </i>
Police !
- Search warrant !
- I'm clean, man.
<i>Open the fucking door. </i>
Get down !
Face that shit tight. Greggs.
I'm opening up.
That'd be mine.
In fact,
all that's mine.
You got a law degree ?
Take him.
You fall on the parole violation.
No matter whatever else happens
you do every day of
what's left of your seven
without seeing a jury.
Maybe even conspiracy to murder.
We take this federal, see if we can
get you ten to life... no parole.
Whatever.
Shit, you only do two days no how.
- That's the day you go in.
- And the day you come out.
Yeah, well, here's the warrant.
You read it slow.
In between them two days,
give you something to think on.
Damn.
Missed our shot.
Roll, man.
You bend over for us,
or I swear to God
I will spend what's
left of my career
shitting on every last
supervisor in your district.
From shift commanders down
to sector sergeants, not one of them
will have any rank at all if we
hear so much as a bark out of you.
Look, my people saw this as a
tactical deployment only.
The responsibility is mine alone.
Well, you won't fall alone
unless you're willing to fall exactly
as we want you to.
After COMSTAT,
you go to retirement services
and drop papers, going out
at a lieutenant's grade
That's right, you're busted back.
We can't take your EOD away
but you're not going out
on a major's pay.
I can retire before you bust me.
I got vacation time
enough to make my 30.
Fuck your vacation time.
You're out today, at the lower grade.
That's against the goddamn contract.
What part of bend over
didn't you understand ?
Avon locked up ?
With most of his muscle, yeah.
Good day to get back out
on them corners, ain't it ?
Make some money.
You bet.
It's not just the 17 millions
in federal funding
for Baltimore law enforcement
that you've jeopardized.
Take off another 200 million of federal
money in your operating budget
another 75 in capital expenditures,
plus untold millions in pass-through
federal dollars from Annapolis.
All told, we're talking about
half a billion a year that Baltimore
will be doing without.
Furthermore, the U.S. Attorney here
will use all the resources
of the Justice Department
to interdict and destroy
any attempt to establish
a geographic entity
where drugs are legal.
Washington should know that
what happened in West Baltimore
in no way reflects the policies
of my administration.
That was an aberration,
Mr. Talmadge.
The work of one
misguided police official.
We understand your concerns
but for the deputy drug czar
to take the time out
to drive 30 miles north
to deliver that message,
hardly necessary.
Rest assured.
What up, G ?
Where the older ones at ?
Marlo got his package back out.
Fire Burrell.
This nonsense began in his shop
without him knowing it.
Fire the man and move on.
Odell, I respect your opinion.
But right now
Tony Gray, Carcetti maneuvering
now is not the time.
We get past the primary, then I'll drive
a stake in his heart.
But right now
I need him where he is
for no other reason than to
well, to take the hit
for this thing right here.
But I tell you what
I'm gonna do, though.
I'm gonna shine on that new girl
you like in the 11th.
Give her a spot on the ticket.
Cut Eunetta loose.
Eunetta's had her day.
I respect the fact that
you stood by me, Odell.
I respect loyalty.
And did so without properly
informing his superior officers
and without regard to the criminal
statutes he was sworn to enforce
thereby disgracing himself
and his command.
Is any of that subject
to any contradiction
or argument whatsoever,
Major Colvin?
No, sir.
No argument at all, Bunny ?
Not much you can say, is there ?
Not to real police.
- Get on with it,motherfu...
- 'Scuse me, major ?
Is the admin lieutenant present ?
Major Colvin is relieved of duty.
You are now the acting commander
of the Western District.
- Hey, Bunk.
- Hey, Freamon.
- Who is that ? Crutchfield ?
- Naw, Norris.
Sleeping on a stakeout.
<i>Damn, Bernard, didn't I tell
you about these guys ?
Yeah, that's everyone
we heard on the wire.
McNulty's over there in number
one with Pearlman.
Why don't you say hey ?
You got to be
the stupidest motherfucker
that I've ever gone out with.
I can't wait to go to jail.
What ? What you say ?
What the fuck did you say, Bernard ?
Hey, Donald.
- You heard the tapes.
- Look, he came to me
and said we could sell drugs
if we move down to Vincent Street
and that's where I moved my crew.
And you know I did because you the one
that popped me with the G-pack
on my way to the spot,
and let me go, remember ?
You were selling drugs
in Major Colvin's free zone ?
- You can prove that.
- Ask him. He know.
This must be one of them
contrapment things.
You mean entrapment.
Kid's got a point.
19 in bracelets
from Barksdale on down.
Another eight wanted on warrants.
Any way you can tie your case
to this mess with Colvin ?
Make it like what he was
doing led to your thing ?
I don't see it.
Well, it's good work
nonetheless, Major Daniels.
Call came in from the Mayor's office
half hour ago
approving your promotion.
And now with Colvin,
there's a new vacancy.
- What about my wife ?
- What about her ?
The Mayor. Eunetta's seat.
- Why would the Mayor...
- Good police work maybe.
Not everything is politics.
Hey, I'll take two. Western alumni.
All right, you got it.
Major.
I heard.
How's your family take it ?
Lolita done dropped herself
30 pounds and got herself
a real estate license
so I guess she's fixin'to leave me.
I just wanted you to know
that last tip you gave me
was a winner.
Yeah, I heard.
That's good work.
Also, I don't know if you know,
Stringer Bell was shot to death
two days ago.
So anyway,
I put his name on the paper
to tighten the PC.
I figured what the fuck
once he's aced, right ?
You always did cut
them corners, didn't you ?
Seems like you cut a few
yourself, Major.
However it ends,
you're good police.
I just did what I did.
It felt right.
I'm fine with that.
I don't understand.
Drink your wine.
You and me in public.
- But your wife.
- She wins without me.
On the Mayor's ticket, she wins.
And you make major ?
I think she was waiting for this day
more than I ever was.
And now she's not here.
No.
She's not.
From out of nowhere, huh ?
Nowhere is right.
Why me ?
I guess you don't live right.
- Kari, what was that ?
- Nothing.
- What broke ?
- Nothing, Mama.
So...
Yeah.
You just drive over here.
I did.
Why tonight ? What happened ?
I was in my old district tonight
which is where I used
to feel pretty good, I think.
I wasn't so angry
when I was there anyway.
I don't know, someone said
something, I guess
and, uhit doesn't make sense.
I guess I finished something today.
A case ?
More than that.
It's like everything
I poured into a glass
came out the bottom
and I just kept on pouring.
Like the thing had
a hole in it, you know.
Things that make me right
for this job
maybe they're the same things
that make me wrong
for everything else.
Do you want to come inside
for a drink ?
Not tonight.
But if it's not too late,
I wouldn't mind
meeting your kids.
Major Colvin misled his officers.
They thought that his initiative
was a tactical deployment
to entrap narcotics traffickers.
There was no mention whatsoever
of the initiative to
any superior officer.
And for five weeks, all evidence
of what he was doing managed to elude
the entire command staff.
Are you kidding, Commissioner ?
I take full responsibility
and indeed, after I first learned
of the matter
I informed the Mayor, and together
we moved immediately
to relieve Major Colvin
I'm under the impression that
this administration
gave serious consideration
with Colvin's initiative.
No, sir.
Major Colvin informed you of his effort
at a COMSTAT meeting
more than a week ago.
His free zones stayed up
for six days after that.
That's my responsibility, Councilman.
We needed the time to conclude
an ongoing investigation
by the Major Crime Unit,
a wiretap case
that would have been disrupted
Correct, Mayor Royce was aware
of the pending case
and allowed us to delay
our response accordingly.
But the Mayor was unequivocal
in his opposition
to what Major Colvin did.
What we have here, I'm afraid,
is nothing more complicated
than a solitary police commander
who, under great pressure
proved to be amoral, incompetent,
and unfit for command.
No.
It's about more than that.
This is more important
than who knew what when
or who falls on his sword
or whether someone
can use this disaster
to make a political point or two.
Mr. Chairman...
We can forgive Major Colvin who,
out of his frustration
and despair, found himself
condoning something which
can't possibly be condoned.
We can do that much.
But, gentlemen, what we can't forgive,
what I can't forgive ever
is how we...
you, me, this administration,
all of us
how we turned away from those streets
in West Baltimore. The poor, the sick
the swollen underclass of our city
trapped in the wreckage of neighborhoods
which were once so prized.
Communities which
we've failed to defend,
which we have surrendered
to the horrors of the drug trade.
And if this disaster demands anything
of us as a city
it demands that we say enough.
Enough to the despair which makes
policemen even think about surrender.
Enough to the fact that
these neighborhoods are not saved
or are beyond the saving.
Enough to this administration's
indecisiveness and lethargy
to the garbage
which goes uncollected
the lots and row houses
which stay vacant
the addicts who go untreated
the working men and women
who every day
are denied a chance
at economic freedom.
Enough to the crime,
which every day
chokes more and more
of the life from our city.
And...
the thing of it is, if we don't
take responsibility and step up
not just for the mistakes
and the miscues
but for whether or not we're gonna
win this battle for our streets
if that doesn't happen
we're gonna lose these neighborhoods
and ultimately this city forever.
If we don't have the courage
and the conviction to fight this war
they way it should be fought
the way it needs to be fought,
using every weapon
that we can possibly muster,
if that doesn't happen
well, then we're staring at defeat.
And that defeat
should not and cannot
and will not be forgiven.
It was a good case
I'm not denying that
but I need to trust my people.
Unless you can give
your word, there's no way...
That's more than fair.
Thanks.
But it's better for me
if I do something else.
Detective.
It's not you, it's me.
- But where...
- The western, I think.
Western feels like home.
You showed something today.
Just felt like it needed to be said.
Sounds like you're
running for something.
Eunetta.
Been a while.
Thought y'all was in training.
So what time you want us to be
there tomorrow, coach ?
3:30 would be good.
- Hope to see you all then.
- A'right.
What the fuck y'all
standing around for ?
Man, get to work.
That's a seed.
Yeah.
What do you see right here?
It's bulk metal. 10˘ a pound.
Here.
Aluminum.
Right you are. 30˘ a pound
no problem.
in these modern times a man
gotta keep one eye on the ground
pick up what he find, feel me ?
There's money to be made
if you know where to look.
I hope you listenin','cause
I'm tryin'to school you here.
Yeah, you don't want to know.
You see, You think you brown,
but you still green.
How ya doin'?
That's somethin', huh ?
It's like they took a big
eraserand rubbed across it.
Yaeh !
Yeah, but before a dope
fiend come down here
cop a little somethin',
ain't nary a soul hassle him.
Hoppers and police,
they just let him be.
Was a good thing, huh ?
I'm just sayin'.
You probly don't know,
but it's rough out there, baby.
Cops be back bangin'on you.
Hoppers be messin' with you.
Thank you.
Aw, shit.
That's a dime here.
That's a seed.
Come on, boy.
