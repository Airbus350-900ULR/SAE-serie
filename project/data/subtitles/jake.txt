What do we got?
Doesn't look good.
Damn things been frozen
since I booted up
this morning and the
floppy drive's jammed.
All right, let me take a look.
Okay.
All right, talk to me, baby.
So?
Well, it's a 20-minute job.
I'll have you up and running in two.
Take your time.
I'm due for a coffee break.
Yeah.
Notify NORAD.
Negative telemetry intercept
on the missile test
over the Sea of Japan.
Per FBI request, the Echelon watch list
is being updated with
the following list.
Ammonia nitrate, cyclonite
and the name Ivan Benikov.
Okay, listen up, everyone.
The CIA station in Kandahar
has been tracking Ivan Benikov,
a terrorist on our watch list.
Now, once we've confirmed
Benikov's I.D. with satellite visuals,
U.S. Centcom has an unmanned drone
standing by to launch a
hellfire missile right at him.
This is so freaking cool.
Uh, can I help you?
Oh, yeah, uh, act-actually,
I'm-I'm helping you.
Uh, uh, I-I'm Jake Foley,
tech support.
I-I was just fixing this computer,
but I'm done. It's fixed.
No problem-o.
Great, Mr. Foley.
Now I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.
Oh. I'll just leave this behind...
...just in case.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Come on, buddy,
we have talked about this.
Trust me, you don't want
to be one of those jerks.
Darin, I would kill to be
one of those jerks.
No, we're in the perfect position
because we're practically agents,
- but we're not props.
- What are props?
Yeah, props - "property of the state" -
guys who actually have clearance.
Those guys, they have no lives.
See, you and me, we can quit
anytime we want and go start
a band or open up a restaurant
or something because we still
have that kind of freedom.
Two tequila shots over here,
please? Thank you.
The minute you know
any kind of real secrets,
like stuff you probably wouldn't
want to know if you want
to go to sleep tonight anyway,
that's when they own you.
And they own you for life.
Darin, you're the only guy
I've ever met whose life goal
- is to keep his options open.
- Cheers.
Huh, God, I hate tequila.
Whoo! Dude, six oâ€™clock.
- Pull out your NSA badge.
- Why?
Because chicks dig spies.
Yeah, but they don't dig geeks.
Voila.
Excuse me, ladies.
I'm Agent Darin Metcalf.
This is Agent Jake Foley.
- Hi.
- You guys work for the NSA?
- Yes.
- Yes.
That's so sexy.
Do you have a license to kill?
Only if you are really bad.
I like that. I like that.
That usually works.
Yeah, that was really good.
Um, I'm going to go home.
- I'll see you later.
- Oh, hey, hey.
The spoils of victory do not always go
to those that give up easily, my friend.
Uh-huh, yeah. I'm going
to go ponder that thought
at home, and I'll see you later.
Hey, leave the door open because,
- uh, I don't have a key.
- Bye.
Hey, stranger.
- Sarah!
- It's been a while.
Yeah. I read about you in alumni notes.
You're working for Senator
Thompson. Congratulations.
Thank you.
I see you're still at the NSA.
Oh, don't tell me - this is your way
of picking up the ladies?
No, no. No, no, no. This... I, uh...
just got off work a little late and I
didn't even realize
that this was even on.
So what are you doing for Thompson?
Oh, right now I'm reviewing
department of defense budgets.
Several of the research divisions
have come in under budget.
I'm trying to figure out
where that money went.
What, you don't trust the government?
I don't trust my therapist, Jake.
Hey, listen up, what
would you think about...
- I don't know...
- Sarah!
... Maybe a...
- Oh.
Come on over.
Those are some of the most
powerful aides in town.
All they wanna do is
drink martinis and gossip.
- Do you want to join us?
- Oh... ye... um...
well, maybe next time.
- I'll see you around, then?
- Yeah.
Oh, Jake...
what, what are you doing
Saturday afternoon?
Saturday? No plans.
Wait. Uh... can I have one of these?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
Um, do you think you could come by
my place and check on my computer?
Something's not right.
Here's my number.
- Sure.
- Great. See ya.
See ya.
Okay, I know you don't smoke.
Who's the girl?
Oh, it's Sarah. I bumped
into her at the bar last night.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Georgetown Sarah?
Lived-in-the-same-dorm-for-four-
years-and-never-asked-her-out Sarah?
That's the one. She wants me
to come by her place on Saturday.
That's awesome!
Why are you not the least
bit excited about this?
Because she wants me
to fix her computer.
It's a service call.
Define "service."
I'm serious. This is your chance.
If you show up like a tech,
then that's all she's going to see.
I hate to break up the moment,
ladies, but we got a server off-line.
That means 'let's go'.
You know, not a lot of people
have been within these walls,
so consider yourself lucky.
- Foley.
- Yeah?
- Foley!
- Oh. Coming, coming.
Sorry.
Nobody reads programming code faster
than you. What am I looking at here?
Let me see.
Hey. You guys know you're off-line?
Don't worry about it. We'll have
you up and running in two minutes.
Oh, this is weird.
So it says here that they're uploading
all the lab's research into, uh...
What?
What?
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Since you're obviously the
smarter one, I need you
to disengage the diagnostics
system so that tech services
doesn't send anyone
else up here. Do it.
Okay. All right.
We have a problem.
Jake Foley, tech support.
I'm done.
Nothing personal.
Drop it!
You okay?
120/80. Good.
That means that your
blood pressure is normal.
Uh... you okay?
Jake?
What?
Uhm. I just asked if you were okay,
which is an incredibly stupid question
when you consider that
you just saw that. Um,
can I get you anything?
Do you want some water
or some aspirin or...
valium?
- I'll be okay, thanks.
- Sure.
Dr. Hughes.
Excuse me.
- Yeah?
- What's the status here?
Well, everything seems to be fine
and Hazmat's got containment, so...
You worked with this
guy for three years.
- Did you have any idea?
- No.
No. Dr. Gage was a jerk.
I mean, this guy thinks equal opportunity
is something you put in your coffee.
But a traitor?
No. Never.
I want to know everywhere Dr. Gage
has been in the past few months -
every phone call, every e-mail...
everybody's he's
been screwing and everybody
who's been screwing him.
He was with us for ten years
so we know he didn't come cheap.
Is that the guy who
made the distress call?
Yeah, Jake Foley. He's tech support.
He's really shaken up
right now, though, so I...
- I want to see him.
- Of course.
Mr. Foley,
I'm Deputy Director Louise Beckett.
I understand that you
made the distress call.
- Nice work.
- Thanks...
I-I... but I was just doing what
any good employee would do
I'm a go-getter.
Yes, so I've been reading.
It says here that you
applied for intel training.
Yes. Twice.
You've served your agency
well today, and I would
like to take this opportunity...
... to reiterate your
confidentiality agreement.
Under no circumstances are you to
recount what happened here today
... to anyone
... ever.
Or what, you'll have to kill me?
Darin?
What?
Sarah.
- Jake.
- Hope you like vino.
Uh... of course.
- Yeah. Uh, come in.
- Okay.
Oh, wow. This is a great place.
Rumor has it Bill and Monica
had a couple of trysts here.
- Really?
- Yeah, I didn't buy it at first,
but it kind of has that vibe -
don't you think?
I feel it.
Oh, so here it is.
Ah, the offending piece of hardware.
In all its Pentium II outdated glory.
Do you want me to open this?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Let's pop it.
"Let's pop it"?
Idiot.
We have a problem.
Jake Foley, tech support.
It sounds like you have a problem.
Take care of it.
... You have a problem...
I know this guy -
Eric Vaughn -
black market arms dealer
with ties to the IRA
operating out of Belfast.
Been on British CTU's
wanted list for a year now.
He was behind the research
theft for the SS-G-20,
their next-generation
laser-guided missile.
Well, our agents in Belfast
will have their hands full.
I'd like your permission
to head a team to track him.
- No, we've discussed this before, Kyle.
- I belong in the field.
- Your cover was compromised.
- Yeah, through no fault of my own.
- They never forget a face over there.
- Come on, it's been two years.
- Listen to me. Listen to me!
- I'm being wasted here.
I'll use my agents as I see fit.
You want to work for me, you work here.
Well, I can tell you already
you need a new mouse.
These days, it's all about the wireless.
- Really?
- Uh... oh. Thanks.
Hey, I was wondering:
Who are these guys?
This one's my dad.
Oh, yeah? Was he in, uh, Desert Storm?
Not technically. He went over
to test some classified weapons system.
Wow, that's really cool.
He never came back.
Oh.
The worst part is they won't even
tell my family what happened.
He's gone, and all they say is,
"that's classified."
Just makes me feel
so helpless, and I...
I'm sorry.
Here you are, coming and doing a favor,
and I'm dumping all
this baggage on you.
No, no - dump on me.
- Um...
- Yeah.
Look... well, it's...
it's like when we were in college, and
I'd come and fix your
computer all the time, and
you were always apologizing,
and, well...
You probably didn't know, but...
I-I-I didn't mind.
I liked helping you.
I like helping you.
Um... the-the-the thing is...
- Uh...
- What?
Uh, you should probably get that.
Uh.
Hello. Oh, hey.
How was last night? 4:00 A.M.?
So glad I didn't come.
Who was there?
He was there?
Oh, my god. You fixed it.
- How did you do that?
- Uh...
I, uh... I don't know.
Jake, you don't look so good.
I, uh... I think that, um,
24-hour flu is more like, um,
a 36, or maybe a 48.
Um...
I'm sorry. I-I-I... I got to go.
Uh...
Whoa.
Over here, mister.
Yeah, here you go.
- Sorry.
- Hey, you all right, man?
- Sorry.
- God.
That guy's got some arm.
There're rumors going around
there were problems in your lab.
What's going on?
Oh, nothing, really, you know.
Some shelves collapsed
and some... some of my mice got out,
but, you know - no big deal.
Oh, let's go, let's go, let's go.
You mean, there wasn't any gunfire?
Gunfire?
You kidding me? Girl, you need
to stop watching so much TV.
- Jake.
- Hey.
Hi. Oh, uh...
- Diane.
- Yeah, right.
Yeah. What are you doing down here?
Oh, I just, uh, wanted to follow up
and make sure your
server's running okay,
'cause that's my job -
to, um, follow up.
Oh, thanks. Well, yeah,
the server's fine.
- Good.
- Who-whoa.
So is your arm.
Yeah. Yeah. I-I-I've got one of those
killer immune systems.
I got to go, uh,
so I'll see you around.
If you have any more problems
with the server, just give us a call.
Oh! Whoa!
Oh, my god.
Whoo-hoo!
What is with these double locks?
Please tell me that there was some
really rough sex going on here.
Darin, you are not going to believe...
You remember Casey.
Ah, Yeah. Hi.
Hey. I never pictured spies living
like really poor college students.
Yeah, that's, uh...
that's exactly our cover.
Right.
So... Agent Foley...
don't you have an op to go to?
Right.
Come on in, come on in. Let me
show you our debriefing room.
You wanted to see me.
Eric Vaughn is in the country.
What?
Probably the east coast.
Most likely D.C.
How do you know?
I called some former assets.
I think he's here because
he doesn't trust anybody else
to pick up whatever
he paid Gage to steal.
Gage failed.
We got him before he managed
to steal anything.
We got a problem.
Sarah, look, I am so sorry
for barging in like this,
but I have got to talk to you.
- Jake. What is it?
- This is going to sound insane,
- but there are these things and...
- You got to try this.
It's the guanciale,
makes all the difference.
Peter, this is Jake. Jake, Peter.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- So what were you saying?
- Oh, uh...
oh, it's nothing that
can't wait, actually.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.
- It was nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you, Jack.
Jake.
I am so bad with names. Dinner's ready.
Let's go
Sorry.
Oh. Thanks.
Not a problem.
If there's one thing I'm good
at doing, it's pushing buttons.
You didn't think that
was very funny, did you?
Uh... no, well, yeah, I did.
No, you're just being polite.
My humor doesn't translate here.
Back in Ireland they'd be dying by now.
I know. Sure.
Are you really, Jake?
I'm sorry, how'd you know my name?
Let's just say I have an interest in you.
Or rather what's inside of you.
Don't worry, Jake.
I wouldn't hurt you.
But my associate might.
- Hey!
- Use a tazer!
We got to him just in time.
It's remarkable.
You see how the nanites
have positioned themselves
along his central nervous system?
What they're doing is establishing
contact with the brain
via electrical impulses,
but eventually,
that link will be seamless.
I mean, whatever...
whatever he wants
them to do, they'll do.
So this is what Vaughn's after,
some kind of future soldier.
Exactly.
It began as a research program for DoD.
It was intended for soldiers in combat
to help repair damaged tissue.
But we realized pretty early on
that when you're dealing with
molecular-sized computers,
the possibilities are endless.
I mean, this guy can
interface with technology.
He's like a universal remote.
And every one of his body
functions is enhanced.
- Meaning what?
- Meaning that...
I can hear everything!
We're just going to run
a few more tests, Mr. Foley.
We're going to have you
out of here in no time.
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.
How are we going to get
these things out of me?
Uh... well...
the nanites are fully integrated
into your system. They're...
they're part of you now.
They're not something we can
take out of you.
But I'm going to be fine,
right? I mean,
it's not like they're going
to hurt me or anything...
- ... right?
- There are side effects.
Like what?
Some of the lab mice
experienced muscle spasms...
blindness...
partial or full paralysis.
In rare cases, they rejected
the nanites and the results...
not good. But that
doesn't mean that any
of these things are going
to happen to you, all right?
What is going to happen to me?
Honestly, we just...
we don't know.
So how long are you going to hold him?
Mr. Foley is none of your concern, Kyle.
Did you even give him a choice?
Choice is a luxury. You know that.
I have the agency's
interests to consider.
Oh, the Agency's interests or your own?
You're out of line.
Look, it was an accident,
... and I'm sorry about that,
but I am not going to
pass up this opportunity.
- Opportunity?
- Yes, we don't know how long this guy's
going to live and we need to learn
what we can while we can.
Unbelievable. Lou,
this guy risks his life for us
and in exchange, we're going
to turn him into a lab rat?
I hope it's worth it.
You are a very brave
man flying international,
very brave. Between the security,
the background checks...
The metal detectors,
the national guard standing there
- with their semi-automatic weapons...
- Hello?
- Jake?
- Oh, Sarah.
I need to talk to you.
Well... now's not really the best time.
Jake, please. I'm really scared
and I have no one else to turn to.
You remember what I told you about
the budget discrepancies at the DoD?
- Yeah, yeah, unused funds or something?
- They weren't unused, Jake.
They were diverted... to the NSA.
- What?
- Yeah. Nobody knows what it's for,
and whoever does wants
to make sure I don't find out.
- Sarah...
- No, wait.
Maybe I'm being paranoid, but.
Remember when you
stopped by the other night?
Ms. Neilmeyer in 3-C saw
two weird guys in the lobby.
The next morning, the place
was completely trashed.
I mean, did you see anything?
No. No. No. Uh,
it was probably
just a couple of guys...
kids... pranks... it was a prank.
Look, maybe it sounds crazy, but
I think I'm being followed.
We've got visual.
Target is seated in the window,
speaking to a caucasian woman.
... It's like at any minute,
someone's going to come for me.
Sarah, listen to me,
I want you to get up,
- walk straight out of here and get in a cab
- So you believe me?
Sarah, please. Go back
to your office right now.
You're right. Right.
We never should've met here.
What was I thinking?
Oh, I'm sorry. My fault. You all right?
Yeah.
Sarah, you got to listen to me.
No, Jake, you listen to me.
Meet me at the Chemdyne
Research Facility,
midnight, alone,
or your friend is dead.
- Hello.
- Casey dumped me, man.
She thought it was too
dangerous dating a spy.
You're not a spy.
Rub it in, man. Rub it in.
Darin, can we talk about this later?
Uh, okay, whatever.
Hello? Darin...
Darin, I'm losing you, man.
Hello, Jake.
Chemdyne Research.
Kyle?
Now, just what the hell
do you think you're doing
at a cryogenics facility?
What? What?
Are you tracking me?
That's right. I'm sorry, Jake.
I need to bring you in.
Kyle, you can't.
Please, he's got my friend.
Who has your friend?
That Irish guy, the one
who was coming after me.
Jake, don't do anything.
I'll have a team there in ten minutes.
No, no, no! Kyle,
it's a trade. Me for her
or she's dead. I got to go.
Wait, wait! Jake, now
listen to me very carefully.
I'm tracking three figures
inside the building.
One of them is probably your friend.
- How do I get in?
- There's a stairwell
on the side of the building
leading to the roof.
Now, that's your best
chance of getting around
Vaughn's men at the front entrance.
Okay, okay. Thanks.
Jake? Jake!
Hold it!
uh-oh.
Sarah? Sarah? Sarah?
Amazing.
Millions of dollars in
research and development
and the best they can
come up with is you.
She'll be fine.
Just taking a little nap.
Where you're going is far more restful.
What you gonna do?
- Huh, freeze me in liquid nitrogen?
- No,
First I'm going to put a
bullet through your brain.
Then I'm going to freeze
you in liquid nitrogen.
What's the point of that?
Unfortunately, Jake,
you've reduced your worth
- to that of a carry-on case.
- Wait, no, no.
Listen. I can do some pretty
amazing things, right?
Don't you think people
would pay more money
if they could see it for themselves?
What are you suggesting, Jake?
A little bit of show and tell?
Yeah, yeah. I could do some jumping
and some cool strength stuff.
I can bend some... or- or
I have great vision.
I can see to, like, Texas.
And I can do stuff you
don't even know about.
I can interface with computers,
totally wireless. Incredible.
And how do we suggest
we demonstrate that?
Like that.
Go, go, go! Go on!
Sarah? Sarah?
He's dead, sir.
Sarah, are you okay?
Sarah?
We'll take care of her.
We've been ordered to bring you in.
Can I offer you a glass of water,
a cup of coffee?
Are you joking?
I have millions of these little things
running around in my body
that might kill me
at any moment.
I have spent the last couple
of days running for my life,
getting shot at because
of these little things
that might kill me at any moment.
So do I want a cup of coffee?
No, I don't want a cup of coffee.
You know what I want?
I want my life back.
I'm afraid we can't do that, Jake.
Yeah, yeah. Big surprise.
What I can do is upgrade
your security clearance,
effective immediately.
Ye...
what?
I've just been authorized
to create a special
ops team with you at its core.
Whoa, whoa. Hold on. Hold on.
I didn't ask for any of this, okay?
Yes, you did... twice.
This is your big chance.
Don't waste it.
Hey, bought you a gift.
Oh, thank you.
I guess you heard about what happened.
Yeah, Sarah, I am so sorry.
Sorry? Why? It wasn't your fault.
I was the one looking
into the missing money.
- What?
- That's why they came for me.
Obviously, I was getting
too close to something
the NSA doesn't want us to know about.
Sarah, maybe you should
consider just leaving that alone.
Look, I know you're trying to
protect me and I appreciate it,
but I can't let this go.
You know, you don't have to be a hero.
Oh, I know. There are no heroes, Jake.
Not anymore.
Right. Right.
Look, I just wanted you to know that...
Yeah?
Uh, that...
I'm here for you...
uh, in case you need me.
You're the best.
Thank you.
# Where do you go?
# Are you looking for answers
Um, okay.
# To questions under the stars?
# Well, if along the way
# You are grown weary
# You can rest with me
# Until a brighter day
# When you're okay
# I am no superman
# I have no answers for you
# I am no hero,
# ah, that's for sure
# but I do know one thing
# is where you are is where I belong.

Previously on Jake 2.0
I'm Jake Foley, tech support.
I see you're still at the NSA.
We have a problem.
You see how the nanites have positioned
themselves along his
central nervous system.
This guy can interface with technology.
He's like a universal remote,
and every one of his
body functions is enhanced.
I've just been authorized
to create a special ops team
with you at its core.
Drop your weapon and
hand over the pouch.
What?! No, no, no.
Oh, man.
You're not listening.
You've failed the simulator again.
I keep telling you, always
count your shots, Jake.
Twelve in the mag, one in the pipe.
I know, it's just... All right, look,
I messed up, okay?
But did you see that jump?
I mean, come on. It...
Yeah, yeah. I did; it was impressive,
but in the real world, you're dead.
What do they want?
We've got a guy with
a half billion dollars' worth
of nanotechnology inside of him.
They want results.
Oh, we're getting results, honestly.
Just look at what he can do. Here.
Okay, see this? It's what
I use to monitor Jake
and track his vitals and
stuff like that. Okay,
so... look here.
His breathing is normal for this level
of exertion. His heart rate's 103.
Now, here...
This is when he sees the rocket
grenade thing - whatever you call it - and
his adrenals are up 300% instantly.
That is the nanites
triggering his adrenal glands.
I mean, Jake's muscles are not
any different than yours or mine,
but you hit him with this
much adrenaline, and,
I mean, their performance
just increases tenfold,
and the same goes for
his sight and hearing.
I mean, the nanites simply enhance
all of his existing functions.
It's technology at its best. It's...
- it's beautiful.
- It's unpredictable.
Diane, he was dropped to his knees
by one of our metal detectors.
Yeah, I'm, uh...
I'm working on that, but
you have to understand that
the nanites are molecular computers,
which makes him susceptible
to the same kinds of things as,
well, your average desktop - I mean,
electromagnetic waves,
and power surges,
and viruses... the hacking...
... - well, technically - I mean,
the chances of that,
I think, are really low,
and-and I don't even know how
an outsider would even know that...
Okay, okay. Kyle?
Yeah, he's strong; he's fast...
but I'm concerned about his instincts.
He has yet to beat the simulator room, and
he can barely bring himself to hit someone.
I'm afraid that if we put him in the
field, he'll be a danger to himself
- and any other agent he's with.
- Enough, enough.
- All he needs is more time.
- He's had three weeks.
- They're giving us one more.
- What?
Diane, they want to see a demonstration.
If we can't prove Jake's a viable
use for this technology,
they're going to shut us down.
You're going to shut down my program?
This is years' worth of research.
Well, they would continue to study
him in a controlled environment.
What - they're going to lock him up
in a room like a lab rat? Wh...
he's a human being.
They-they... they can't do that.
Oh, they can, and they will.
Oh, yeah, we're still having some
trouble with the cramping, and...
That's me. Jake Foley,
I'm in Tech Support.
Security Clearance: Low.
Very low.
Then one day, it all changed.
Now, I can do things
I've never dreamed of.
I've been upgraded.
I have these powers.
Life just got real interesting.
"Sandstorm" in position.
Copy that, Sandstorm.
Look, we're still not able to get a
read on that inside heat signature.
- Please stand by.
- Standing by.
- What's going on?
- It's Al Juhuara -
a terrorist cell in Tunisia.
They've gotten their hands
on one of our EMPs.
Electromagnetic pulse bomb?
That's right.
We're going to get it back.
We only got a half an hour
of darkness left,
and coming home empty-handed
is not an option.
Request permission to proceed.
Well, that's not how I'd like to go in,
but it is your call, Sandstorm.
Don't worry yourself, Chief.
No worries here...
and just a reminder, you are authorized
- for flash and bang only.
- Copy that.
- Percussive grenades?
- Yeah. They want to stun the guards
- before storming the compound.
- Oh, that's a good idea.
Okay, boys,
let's go wake 'em up.
Come in, Sandstorm.
Sandstorm, come in.
Sandstorm, do you copy?
Yeah, I copy. Sorry.
Looks like I got a little
sand in my radio.
Well, I'll tell you what.
You bring it home,
and I'll clean it myself.
I'll take you up on that, chief.
We got the target in good hands.
Request permission to head home.
Good work.
How unbelievable.
Well, that's what real agents do.
"That's what real agents do, Jake."
"In the real world, you'd be dead, Jake."
Oh.
Hello?
Okay, I know you're going
to think I'm a total idiot,
but where is my "C:" Drive?
Uh, it's in your computer.
No. It isn't showing up.
Uh, oh-oh, um, hit control
function 8 all at the same time.
There it is. Jake, you're amazing.
I try.
I miss seeing you.
- You do?
- Yeah. Can I take you to lunch?
I'd love to catch up.
Um, okay.
- Are you free tomorrow?
- Yeah.
How 'bout, um, 1:00 at Mick's?
Yeah, okay, sure. That sounds fine.
All right, uh, I'll see you then. Bye.
- Hey.
- Hi. Uh...
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I-I just was on my way home,
uh... sort of.
I actually live on the other
side of the hill, but, uh...
I picked this up on the weekend.
- It's a desk lamp.
- That's...
really nice. Thanks.
Welcome.
Do you want to come inside?
Yeah.
This is going to look great...
well, when I have a desk.
Can I get you something to drink?
- Uh, yeah, just water is fine.
- Okay.
I haven't unpacked my glasses yet.
I've kind of been drinking
out of the faucet.
Oh, I'm good then.
You know what? I'm going
to find you one. Hold on.
I guess you can probably kiss the
security deposit good-bye, huh?
Yeah, I don't really know
my own strength anymore.
Well, you'll get used to it.
Yeah, I was thinking that,
this whole thing's really weird,
'cause-'cause I come home
from work one day,
and all my stuff's packed up in boxes,
and my roommate's been
transferred out of the country,
and then I'm forced to come live here,
'cause it's supposedly
a more secure location
above Luigi's Deli.
You smell that? I do.
Twenty-four hours a day.
Well, all things considered,
I think that you're
handling things pretty well, um...
Diane, you don't have to say that.
I saw the way you guys were looking
at me today, and it's pretty clear that,
uh, even if I wanted to be
an Agent my entire life,
I may just not be cut out for it.
Jake...
do you know what happens
if you don't make it?
What?
I don't get my Nobel Prize, and
I really want my Nobel Prize,
you know - I-I want
the-the fame, and I want the money, and
I really want the medal...
So this whole
"I don't think I can make it" thing -
I think you better lose it,
or I'm going to have to kick
your nanobot butt, okay?
What's the deal with the TV?
Oh, yeah, the TV. Well,
uh, the cable guy was
supposed to come by -
twice - but, uh, you
know how that goes.
You know that you could just...
fix it yourself.
Wouldn't that be illegal?
Uh, shouldn't it be illegal
for the cable guy to make
you wait around all day
and not show up?
Good point.
There you go.
You want to stick around
for a while, watch some TV?
Yeah. Yeah.
So is, is this the place where
you tell me my mission,
should I choose to accept it?
Right.
Armory access open.
Cool. Wow.
Ah, this is where we get our side arms.
It's where I get mine.
Right.
Well, I guess as long as we're
together, then, uh, I'm covered.
Vault Access Open.
What's in there?
It's the most secure
vault in the building:
Three feet of lead and steel, impenetrable
to any and all types of blasts.
Cool.
I just can't get over that Agent Wright.
I mean, the guy is awesome.
Hey, you ever think they'll
ever send me to Tunisia
or someplace like Tunisia,
someplace exotic?
Jake, this is the NSA.
We're the largest and most powerful
intelligence agency in the world.
There are 46,000 people working here,
all charged with the
awesome responsibility
of keeping this nation safe.
Not one of them, including myself,
is concerned with whether or not
you'll be sent someplace "exotic".
Right... no, of course.
Hey, so, Kyle, what are we doing here?
Is something going down, or...
Look around, Jake.
Tell me what you see.
Okay, uh...
I see, uh, mom pushing
a baby in her stroller...
some... businessmen,
probably on lunch break.
There's, uh, woman jogging -
she's kind of hot.
Not that it matters.
Does it? I don't know.
Let me tell you what I see.
Six people on cell phones.
Any of them could be ordering a hit.
Three backpacks and a baby carriage,
each large enough to hold
enough C-4 to level a city block.
Right.
Now, as to the reason we're here.
The NSA intercepted a phone call.
An unidentified state
department official
is attempting to sell some information.
That exchange is going down here.
We have two agents
covering the north end.
You and I will cover the south.
Okay.
Jake, this may be our
only chance at this guy.
You understand?
Yeah, yes, yes, yes, sir.
Absolutely, I'm ready.
- Good.
- Let's go. Let's do this.
Oh, let's do this. Yeah. Take it.
So this is everything?
It's all there.
Nobody can know about this.
Of course not.
Kyle.
Kyle!
Kyle... Kyle!
Kyle, I got him!
- Everybody down! Federal agent!
- Hey stop!
- Hand it over!
- What?
I'm with the NSA,
pal. I saw everything.
- Jake, what are you doing?
- I got him Kyle. I got him.
Jake, he's not even one of ours.
One of ours?
We're running a training operation, sir.
- It's a case of a mistaken identity.
- Mistaken identity.
- We apologize.
- You're going to hear from my lawyers.
That's what you're going to hear from.
That's great. That's great.
You've managed to catch a hot dog
- vendor paying off his bookie.
- Well, it sounded like a drop, okay?
Jake, think. Now would
a real drop sound like one?
- Huh? Would it be that obvious?
- Maybe,
I don't know.
What do you want from me?
I want you to step up.
Okay? Dig deeper.
Jake, I want you to learn
to look beyond the obvious.
SandOps. This is Sandstorm.
We're headed home with the device.
Copy that.
There you go, sir.
Agent Wright, would you care
for anything else before we land?
No, thank you.
So sorry about that.
All right, let's go again.
You're pretty stressed.
I figure we should just take a break.
No, I'm fine. Let's go again.
Okay.
Go.
Come on. Let's do it.
Okay, just breathe.
Just take it easy.
Come on. No, damn it!
All right, you know, that's it.
That's enough.
- Why does it keep doing that?!
- Because interfacing wirelessly,
especially when the nanites are operating
at this many computations per second,
it's very taxing. They have to shut
themselves down to keep from overloading.
-Well, why don't you increase the threshold?
- Can't do that.
What do you mean you can't?
- It's new technology.
- Diane, I need help.
I don't know how.
This was Dr. Gage's project,
and I came in early on
as his post-doc but I just...
I don't know it like he does,
and I can't ask him because
he's kind of dead so
I'm the best that you got,
and I'm telling you, Jake,
I am doing everything that
I can to help you, but you just,
you can't rely on me to make this happen,
and you can't rely on the nanites.
Hey now, you don't understand.
I am messing up out there,
and the only reason I'm still here
is 'cause of the nanites.
You know what? You're an idiot.
Ow!
What, so are we done?
I guess we are.
You guys done here?
Yes.
Ow! Damn.
We've got something.
Are we going somewhere
cause I kind of have something.
At 1:00. Lunch with
Sarah Carter. I'll drive.
What do you know about Sarah?
She attended Georgetown University,
graduated in 1999 with you.
Currently the legislative director
for Senator Thompson.
You have a thing for her.
She trusts you.
That works in our favor.
What?
Your friend's been
investigating DoD funds
that were diverted to us for
the nanotechnology project.
That's highly classified.
Your objective is to stop
her investigation.
- What's this?
- Your cover.
My cover.
You want me to lie to my friend?
I'll be listening.
Oh, thanks.
Isn't this great?
Just the two of us.
Yeah, yeah. Just the two of us.
So how are things at work?
Oh yeah, same old same old. You know,
just trying to keep the nation's
computers up and running.
How about... how about you?
Are you-you still seeing that guy?
No. He was, um...
I don't know. I just didn't trust him.
How about you?
Oh, no. You can...
you can trust me.
No. No. I mean, are you seeing anyone?
Oh, oh. No. No.
I kind of feel like I'm being
consumed by my work.
That's this town, Jake.
That's what it does to you.
Do you remember when
the most important thing was
how to get beer on a Friday night?
- Jake, get on with it.
- Okay.
What?
Oh, I-I-I meant, um,
yeah, yeah. I remember
what that was like
back in college with the-the...
beer.
Oh,
I'm sorry. I have to get this.
Hello.
I told you I'd have
the stats by friday.
All right, look, you're not helping me.
I can do this, but you have
to get off my back.
Yeah, I know. I know. I am.
And just for the record,
all this training stuff -
you're not so good at it, okay?
Are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah. You know what?
You know when you're
working on a problem,
and you're kind of talking to yourself?
No. Uh, not really.
So what's the problem?
Actually, uh...
actually, it was something
I wanted to talk to you about.
Okay.
Um, well, I came...
I came across something at work,
and, um...
I think it has something to do with those
missing funds you were looking into.
- You did?
- Yeah.
The thing is,
it's actually kind of silly.
Well-well, the NSA wanted to
upgrade some computer systems,
but they didn't want the CIA
to find out about it,
because they-they want
the same thing, so...
they hid the funds.
I don't believe it.
Yeah. Really competitive over there.
No. I mean, I don't believe it, Jake.
They wouldn't come after me
over something like that.
That's a good point.
But, uh,
Sarah, you have to realize
that these computers -
they're really big
and expensive.
No, Jake. It's not true.
I know.
I have a source.
A source?
You sure it's someone
you can trust? 'Cause,
Sarah, the-the Intel that I have
is-is really supposed to be
really reliable.
Great story, Kyle.
Worked like a charm.
I think it did.
What?! Were you listening?
She's not going to quit.
She has a source.
She has a source.
Congratulations. You did good.
Hello.
SandStorm has been compromised.
- Where?
- National Park.
I'm on my way.
What do we know at this point.
At least five people
were killed in the crash.
Alright, listen up, people.
We suffered a terrible blast today.
Agents Wright, Tishler
and Garcia are dead.
We believe the person
responsible for this
took possession of an EMP
and parachuted from the plane.
I've notified the CIA and
the National Security Advisor.
This is a code red threat
to our nation's capital.
Let's get in front of it.
You want me to notify their families?
- No. I'll take care of it.
- Okay.
Hello, Gwen?
This is Lou Beckett.
I'm afraid I have some very
sad news about Nicholas.
It happened at 11:35...
They cut off his hand.
Yeah.
We got to get this guy.
The missing electromagnetic pulse bomb
is a class D portable,
similar to larger devices
we used in Iraq.
Now this one has a blast radius of
approximately two miles.
Any electronic device within
that perimeter will be disabled.
Now as you can imagine,
detonation almost anywhere
in the D.C. Area could be devastating.
Now, fortunately for us, we built it,
- so there are some fail-safes.
- Like what?
Well, first, there's an
encrypted warning beacon.
If he tries to arm it,
we'll get a signal.
Giving us how much time
to find it and shut it down?
Twenty minutes.
- What's the other fail-safe?
- Well, that one might not necessarily work
in our favor. In order to shut it down,
you need the right codes.
Enter the wrong code,
it accelerates the timer.
And there's no turning it off.
- Get the codes.
- Yes, sir.
Who are we looking for?
We picked up a security
cam image in airport in Tunis.
We believe it's Abdul Tiranzi,
Al Juhuara's chief weapons expert.
Tiranzi. Advanced Engineering Degrees.
Helped the Chinese design
their long-range missiles.
His mother's an American.
Why is he listed as
"possibly deceased?"
The Israelis have targeted
him several times,
but they've never confirmed his death.
They did get his brother last year.
- Was his brother Al Juhuara?
- No.
He was a professor in Gaza.
It was a mistake.
- What happened?
- Bad intel.
From us.
Great. So now he's really pissed.
I want Tiranzi's photo
out in the field.
Maybe we'll get lucky.
It's the warning beacon.
He just armed it.
Take whoever you need
and get out there.
Leland, Carvallo, Wallace - let's go.
He's turning South on 18th street.
Copy that.
Target's on the northeast
corner of 19th and M.
- You have 12 minutes.
- Got it.
- Has Alan got those codes?
- I need two more minutes.
We'll make it.
- Hey, are you doing okay?
- Yeah, fine.
Well, your blood
pressure's a little high.
Yeah, probably 'cause I'm standing
around here doing nothing.
- Well, you're still in training.
- I could be in training forever.
Kyle will never believe
I've got what it takes.
Jake, Kyle fought for you.
I mean, when this accident happened and
none of us knew what to do with you,
he's the one that wanted
to make you an agent.
He knew how badly you wanted this.
- He's moving.
- Where?
- South on 19th.
- We're on it.
He's making a left on Pennsylvania.
He's heading for the White House.
You can outflank him at 18th.
Copy that. Doing it now.
Come on.
Hey, on the ground now!
On the ground!
Dude, chill! It was just a stop sign!
Get down! Don't you move!
Watch him.
We got the case.
We have a problem.
There's no EMP;
it's just a transmitter.
He's replicating the warning beacon.
We got another one at
the pentagon. And congress.
Check them all out. Get every
available agent on it now.
Fifty feet right in front of you.
I'm on it.
What do you have?
Do you have anything?
No, just another transmitter.
Watch quadrant D.
Nothing. Just another transmitter.
Ortiz, where are you?
Yo, nothing here.
Another transmitter.
What? What's wrong?
This guy is drawing all our
available agents into the field.
- And...?
- And...
I-it, it's too obvious.
He wants all our attention out there.
He wants all of us out there. Why?
Because the target's not out there.
The target's here,
where we're most vulnerable.
He detonates that bomb inside the NSA,
we lose all our satellite links,
all our communications.
There's a worldwide security blackout.
Al Juhuara has free rein.
How would he ever get in here?
He knows exactly how.
Level five,
the mainframe...
Agent Wright admitted 1723 p.m.
He's here.
Call Kyle. Tell him what's going on,
and evacuate the building.
Jake! Oh...
Hello sir.
Mainframe Access. Open.
Please proceed to the nearest exit.
Going somewhere with that?
I guess not. I'll have days,
maybe weeks...
with nobody watching.
Your world will never be the same.
Don't tell me you're
the best they've got.
Mainframe Access Open.
Vault Access Open.
Hey, come on.
You've got to get out of here.
Freeze! Federal Agent!
You should always count your shots.
12 in the mag...
One in the pipe.
You are so lucky.
A slightly larger dose of that EMP,
I think would have put you out for good.
But as it is now, all we
need's a little reprogramming.
Thank you.
It's nothing. We can
take care of it tomorrow.
Uh, no.
I meant for believing in me...
and... putting up with me.
Well, we're in this together, right?
Right.
Lou wants to see you.
I lost three agents
to this operation, Jake.
Three very gifted agents.
Fortunately, I found one, too.
Congratulations, Agent Foley.
Thanks.
You did good.
So, how'd you know?
Looked beyond the obvious.
- Oh. Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- It's good.
- Yeah.
Oh, hey. Congratulations.
Thanks, thanks a lot. Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Oh, goodness, hi.
Thank you. Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Thank you, thank you. Oh, thanks.
- Who is it?
- Cable guy.
Uh, just a second.
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
Previously on Jake 2.0:
I'm Jake Foley, tech support.
I see you're still at the NSA.
We got a problem.
You see how the nanites have positioned
themselves along his
central nervous system.
This guy can interface with technology.
He's like a universal remote,
and every one of his body
functions is enhanced.
I've just been authorized
to create a special ops team
with you at its core.
- Jake.
- Sarah.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I'm just researching some case law.
Privacy issues, e-mails, NSA stuff.
Well you're not going
to get anywhere today.
It-it's Sunday. The library's closing.
Oh, man.
I just ran all the way across town.
What are you doing here?
Ugh, soybeans.
The farm bill.
I thought I told you this.
Oh, right, right, right.
Well, uh, I'm free.
You wanna, you want
to go get some coffee?
Sure, yeah.
Great. Okay.
Oh, my god, that was horrible.
I've never seen a human
being that shade of green.
All right, look. In my defense,
it was the first time
I'd ever tried tequila.
You picked a hell of a place to do it.
Lincoln fought a war
to preserve the union,
and you thanked him
by puking on his shoes.
Yeah, he never looked
at me the same after that.
Oh, we were better with beer.
Mmm. Grown up a little bit
since then, huh?
You did. You definitely have.
You think?
Yeah, you seem more confident.
Especially lately.
I don't know,
I can't really put my finger on it,
but you're just different.
Well, I've been
working out a little bit.
Can't tell.
Oh, man.
Oh, come on, you
set me up for that one.
So you can tell.
Um... not really.
I'm just kidding.
What's happening?
Base, come in.
Base, we are under attack.
Base, come in.
- They're jamming the signal.
- What do we do?
Nothing. The glass is
completely bulletproof.
The body is a zinc-alloy steel.
They're not getting in here.
Come on.
We got to get out of here.
Do not open that door.
We can't do resist it.
- I'm getting out.
- No!
Give it to me.
That's me. Jake Foley,
I'm in Tech Support.
Security Clearance:
Low. Very low.
Then one day, it all changed.
Now, I can do things
I've never dreamed of.
I've been upgraded.
I have these powers.
Life just got real interesting.
Okay, go left on the next street.
Come on. Yeah, yeah. Here we go.
Okay, Jake, you're pushing
too hard, all right?
No, no, no. I'm about
to make the Eiffel Tower.
No, no, no. I think that
we need to take a break.
No, no, no, no.
I'm almost to the Eiffel Tower.
Jake, the purpose of this exercise
is not winning the game, okay?
Yeah, right.
Come on.
No, okay, I'm going to turn it off.
No, no, no, no. Hold on,
hold on. There it is!
Almost there. Come on.
There it is, there it is. Yeah,
Oh yeah, I won it!
Hhmm... I beat the game.
Oh, yeah, you broke the machine.
Um, see, the purpose
of the whole exercise
is not to win the game, it's to learn
how to control the nanites,
and, you know, just for your info -
not controlling the nanites.
- I'll buy the NSA a new one.
- Oh, well...
somebody's in a good mood today.
Yeah, I had a good weekend.
- Yeah, really?
- I had a date.
Sort of. Uh, I don't know -
it kind of seemed like a date, I think.
A sort of, kind of date. That, uh,
sounds intriguing.
- Yeah.
- Uh, who's the girl?
Sarah. We went to
Georgetown together.
She never really gave me
the time of day,
but yesterday at lunch...
I don't know. It kind of seemed like
things might be changing, you know?
That's good. My advice to you -
don't push too hard.
It was a perfectly orchestrated attack.
What were they after?
John Ramsey, senior engineer for GDLS.
He was transporting
preliminary schematics
for a next generation composite tank.
Plastic and glass fiber.
It's as strong as what we've got,
but 70 percent lighter.
They can be flown in
just about anywhere.
So who are we looking for?
There's been increased
chatter on echelon
indicating possible
Chinese involvement.
How long since you've
had contact with Mei Ling?
Two and a half years.
I can't help you.
Kyle,
she is our most senior double
agent in Chinese intelligence.
If there's anyone who could
confirm their involvement,
let alone help us get this
thing back, it would be her.
There must be someone else
who's been handling her.
No one she's been nearly
as forthcoming with.
The schematics are on
an encrypted laptop.
They have to be physically
removed from the country
in order for their techs to decode it.
It could be smuggled by diplomatic
pouch at any moment, Kyle.
Are you ordering me to do this?
Once you've determined
the meeting place,
we'll get a team in
there and monitor...
No. No.
You want me to talk to her,
I talk to her alone.
No, Kyle, it's protocol.
It's for your safety as well as hers.
This woman reads a room
better than anyone I know.
She can sniff out any agent.
Not necessarily.
They call this art?
You must be in trouble.
And why do you say that?
You called.
I'm sure you know the Chinese have
stolen something very important to us.
We want it back.
A statement was issued.
We've formally denied...
That means nothing.
It's all I know.
So, tell me...
when did you become such a patriot?
Two and a half years ago.
I'll give you the exact date
if you don't remember.
I remember.
I'm prepared to offer you full asylum.
Five years expenses.
Why should I trust you?
Because this is work, Mei Ling.
I've never failed you there.
Full asylum, and two million dollars.
That's a lot of money.
You have a lot to make up for.
I need to get authorization.
I'd suggest you work quickly.
The schematics are
being held in the archives
within the secure corridor
at the embassy.
It's scheduled to be taken out
tonight by diplomatic pouch.
How do we get it?
There's a reception
beginning at 8:00 pm.
You'll be my guest.
You haven't changed.
Neither have you.
So, you and Mei Ling
kind of have this
casablanca thing going on.
Which is none of my business.
It's just... I can sort of relate.
See, I'm having this situation
with someone from my past...
right, you don't care.
So I guess you're going
to that party tonight.
Absolutely not.
Lou, those were her terms.
Kyle, you're no longer a field agent.
Your cover was blown.
Anything you do out there's a risk.
Well, you had no problem
sending me out there this morning.
D.C. is not the field.
That embassy is sovereign territory.
You get caught inside, you're on
your own. There's nothing we can do.
Once those schematics
leave the country...
then there's nothing we can do.
We have other agents who
can perform this operation,
ones who wouldn't be as valuable
to the Chinese if they got caught.
I don't think that's possible. Uh...
I heard everything that they said, and
she only wants Kyle.
To-to do this.
Do you trust her?
I trust her enough.
Well, this is all kind of sudden,
don't you think?
I mean, the nanites
are really sensitive,
and it's not like you mastered control,
you know, that's fine in the
video game, but this,
this is the Chinese embassy, okay?
They have guns and guards
and, and foreign languages.
I mean, anything could go wrong. Jake,
have you really thought about this?
Diane, this is my first mission.
I'm nervous enough,
you're really not helping.
Yeah, sorry.
Mei Ling Wong has arranged
an invitation for me
under the name Felix Garay,
Venezuelan Oil Executive.
At 10:00 pm in the main ballroom,
she'll give me a security card.
It'll allow me access to
the main secure corridor.
Now, at this point, we have
to get Mei Ling out.
If they trace that card
to her, she's dead.
How do we get her out?
Catering truck. Agent
De Grasso will be the driver.
The secure corridor is located
in the basement of the embassy.
Once I'm down there, I'll be
out of range for thermal imaging.
Getting there from the main ballroom,
I'll encounter security cameras here,
here... and here.
Security guards change shifts at 10:30.
That's where Jake comes in. Diane?
Diane?
Yes. Jake, Jake will interface
with the security
recording devices, and,
uh, rewind them thirty minutes,
temporarily disabling
them in the process,
so when Kyle's on the move,
the hallways will appear empty.
The main security office
is located here,
just off the main ballroom.
How close does he have to be?
Uh, well, based on our tests,
I'd say no more than, uh, 30...
- 30 feet.
- Great, great.
So what's my cover?
Uh, I speak a little Spanish, so maybe
I can be another oil executive.
Wait. But... oh no, 'cause we,
we can't be together uh... royalty?
Too obvious? Okay...
billionaire software mogul...
Jake... we create the cover.
Oh, right. Right, sorry, of course.
So, uh, what do you have in mind?
Hors d'oeuvres?
They don't serve themselves.
We've added markers to our
agent's heat signatures.
This way our satellites
can distinguish them
from the other guests at the party.
That's Kyle and Jake in the ballroom,
and De Grasso by the van.
Oh, no...
I got data streaming
in from his nanites.
What the problem?
He's really nervous.
Thank you.
Oh, uh... thank you.
Don't mention it.
Stop and go. Stop and... go...
Thank you.
Jake!
Sarah. Hey...
Okay, this freaking me out.
I keep running into you everywhere.
Yeah, that's... that's crazy.
Must be fate.
So what are you doing here?
Um...
you know, just another invite.
Heard they had good food.
Oh, the wild mushroom tart is fabulous,
you have to try one.
Oh, you know, I've had a whole tray.
Jake. You look great.
Ah, it's a rental.
Well, you certainly fill it out well.
I told, I told you I was working out.
Look, uh, look...
I don't know who,
who he's talking to, but,
his, his blood pressure is rising
and his heart rate is increasing.
His adrenals are activated. Lou...
Lou, is there any way maybe
that we can pull him out of this,
because, I, I don't know,
I, I think this is not good.
Diane. The mission
hasn't even started yet.
Okay, yeah.
Are you nervous?
What? Ah, no. No, no, no,
I'm having a great time, this is,
you know I missed this last year,
and it's, this is good.
You think?
You're not having fun?
Fun?
You know why I'm here, Jake?
Congressman Williams.
The Agriculture Committee?
My fun involves lingering
around the background,
waiting for the right moment
to make small talk,
in the hopes he comes
aboard for the Farm Bill.
Truth be told,
I'd rather be anywhere else.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I'm sorry... talking your ear off.
One glass of veuve clicquot too many.
- Uh...
- What are you doing?
Uh, nothing. Nothing, it's just so
crowded over there.
Hot, you know, uh,
you, you wanna go dance? Let's dance.
How have you been?
Well, I haven't danced in a while.
I couldn't tell.
Now you're just flattering me.
Is it that obvious?
About as subtle as that
dress you're wearing.
Does it look familiar?
Hong Kong.
Impressive.
And I wasn't even wearing
it for very long.
Look at those two.
I mean, get a room.
Maybe they're just
caught up in the moment.
Yeah...
that happens.
Right now,
if you had to choose,
me or the mission...
At the bar, directly
behind me, is a waiter.
He's an agent.
He'll escort you to the catering truck
and get you out of here.
Mei Ling, you have to go.
Now.
Oh, incoming. There's your mark.
Oh, whoa! Why'd you do that?
Do you know what? It's,
it's nothing that can't wait.
Just for... just for right now,
I want to forget about work
and have some fun.
Okay. What'd you have in mind?
I want to feel like we did in college.
You know, I want to... get a six pack
and go to the Lincoln Memorial,
and not worry about anything at all.
What do you think?
Uh... I think that sounds...
perfect.
Okay. Come on, let's do it.
Uh... I, I can't.
Why?
Excuse me. I need a refill.
You're, you're a waiter.
Yes, he is.
And let's make it a double this time.
Can I get a rye on the rocks?
Make it a double.
- Was that really necessary?
- Yes, it was.
Jake, you can't afford
to get distracted.
Well, I wasn't the only one
who was being distracted.
You still have feelings for her?
- That's irrelevant.
- Is it?
You know what - it's time.
Let's just finish this.
Jake's in place.
Kyle's on his way.
Jake...
What are you doing?
I'm, uh...
I'm not exactly sure
how to explain what I'm doing.
You're moonlighting.
You're making a little
extra money on the side.
Jake, you don't have to
pretend with me.
Sarah...
I'm an undercover agent.
I'm here on a huge mission.
That's hilarious, Jake.
Okay, when are you getting off?
Uh...
l-l-less than an hour.
Right. Lincoln Memorial.
- I'll get the beer.
- Okay.
What are you doing?
I'm quitting.
He's in.
Telephone. Agent Wallace.
Lou Beckett.
What do you mean, she never
made it to the safe house?
Where's the driver?
Oh, no.
Good job.
Unfortunately,
you made the wrong choice.
It will help you be more honest.
I know how difficult
that could be for you.
You could've gotten out.
You could've been free from this life.
I am out.
Delivering you is my final mission.
Don't do this, Mei Ling.
It didn't have to be like this.
Two and a half years ago,
we could've made a life together.
Two and a half years ago...
you would've been dead.
We have a situation
at the Chinese embassy.
Yes.
I understand.
Jake is still on the grounds.
What's happening?
Mei Ling never made
it to the safe house.
I can't reach Agent De Grasso.
Kyle was supposed
to check in ten minutes ago.
His intel on our mainland agents
is far more valuable to the Chinese
than the schematics.
Well, but he's an experienced agent.
I mean, he would never...
say anything.
When they're through with him,
he won't have a choice.
Ms. Beckett.
Agent De Grasso's dead.
Jake, you listen to me.
You need to get out of there now.
I can't. There's guards everywhere.
Your cover hasn't been compromised.
Just act casual.
Walk through the front gate.
We'll have a team
waiting there for you.
Where's Kyle?
We haven't heard from him yet.
What?
I can't just leave him here.
Jake, Kyle's an experienced agent.
If he has any problems,
he can handle it.
Okay. Okay.
Now, you just stay on the phone.
You're just talking to a friend.
I don't believe you.
We intercepted a message.
Chinese intelligence suspected
you were working with us.
They had snipers waiting
outside the Hotel in Seville.
If I had shown up there...
if I'd even shown up in the city...
they would've killed you.
I did what I did...
to save your life.
You're lying.
Mei Ling, listen to me.
Why do you think I'm here?
Why do you think I'm doing this?
To get you out once and for all...
so that we can be together.
I love you.
It's too late.
You're almost there.
Yes... she didn't want the glass.
She wanted the whole bottle. Yeah.
Wait a minute.
We're not getting anything out of him.
- I hear him.
- What?
I hear him. It's Kyle. He...
he's in the basement.
- It was a setup.
- What?
They wanted Kyle all along.
This whole thing was a setup.
Jake, you need to get out
of there right now.
Uh...
hello?
Where are you going? Jake, you-you-you're
not heading towards the gate.
I'm, uh, I'm losing you.
Jake.
All you have to do...
is give me names.
I see.
Oh, my god.
He's gone. Look at this, he's gone.
Seventy-five thousand volts
of electricity.
Are you sure?
You go ahead.
Enough?
You go to hell.
No worries, I've all night
Hey!
Come on.
What are you doing?
I'm getting you out of here.
No... Jake. Jake.
There's no way out.
Sure there is.
I want you to stab me in the throat.
As hard as you can.
- What?
- Jake, listen to me.
They make me talk,
people will die.
This is what being
an agent is all about.
Now, do your job.
My job...
is to get you out of here.
Now, come on.
Jake, there's no way out.
I can't see anything.
You've got to trust me.
Look. Look!
They're alive.
How are we doing this?
Those new Cadillacs,
they're completely computerized, right?
Yeah. Yeah.
Go. Go, now.
Come with me.
I can't.
You must go now. Go.
Are you going to open the gates?
Nope.
Thank you. Thank you.
They're out.
That fear thing...
it never goes away.
Bali.
On the beach.
She was wearing a white dress...
no shoes.
Georgetown.
Freshman year.
I have no idea what she was wearing.
I just remember her eyes.
D.C.
She held a gun to my head...
then she kissed me.
I never kissed her.

Previously on Jake 2.0:
I'm Jake Foley, tech support.
I see you're still at the NSA.
Oh, my god.
We got a problem.
You see how the nanites
have positioned themselves
along his central nervous system?
This guy can interface with technology.
Every one of his body
functions is enhanced.
I've just been authorized
to create a special
ops team with you at its core.
So what's my cover?
Jake.
Sarah.
I'm an undercover agent.
That's hilarious.
Mr. Carano has instructed
me to ask for $5 million
as a good faith down payment.
That will put you in first position
to buy some of the micro semtex.
Or...
if you like, all of it.
For how much?
$20 million.
Payable upon delivery.
Let's say you don't want
anyone to suspect
that you're interested in
blowing up a particular target.
Say...
you don't want to draw
attention to yourself
by dropping off a small package
or a backpack,
that cries out to any security guard
with half a brain, "I'm a bomb."
And finally,
let's say you don't want
to mess with any timers or
faulty wires or
an ignition switch
that's less than reliable.
In that case, this device
will prove extremely useful.
That's me. Jake Foley,
I'm in Tech Support.
Security Clearance:
Low.
Very low.
Then one day,
it all changed.
Now, I can do things
I've never dreamed of.
I've been upgraded.
I have these powers.
Life just got real interesting.
Sat ops confirms Agents Foley
and Duarte have confiscated weapons.
I say again, Operation
Canada Goose is complete.
You all right?
I'll live.
Yeah, a whole lot of
other people will, too.
How'd you know it was this truck?
I interfaced with
the driver's cell phone.
My Serbo-Croatian's pretty
minimal, but I thought
he said something about
his mother's cheese gun.
So in our report,
we'll just say you heard
the word "gun."
Ri-i-ight. Let's go to work.
Let's go.
Hey, Jake.
Hi, Karen.
Your newspapers were
starting to pile up,
so I thought I'd take them
in while you were away.
Oh, yeah, I guess I forgot
to stop delivery.
- Thank you. Thanks a lot.
- So how was the vacation?
Good. Uh, you know,
those cruise ships
are great for getting away from it all.
I thought you went to Yellowstone?
I did...
by way of Panama.
You went to Panama and
Yellowstone in six days?
There wasn't much to see in Panama.
The main thing is it was relaxing,
but I'm pretty tired right now.
Were you in a fight?
Uh, no, no...
I was trying to get something
out of my carry-on
and you know how they say that you're
luggage shifts in flight? Well,
they're really not kidding.
Kind of big for a carry-on.
Well... good night, Karen.
Hey, Sarah, it's Jake.
I guess we're still playing phone tag.
But this time it's my fault.
I was on a cruise to Yellow...
uh... Panama.
Yeah, yellow Panama.
It's on the coast.
It's a little touristy. But, um...
well, that's pretty much it. So...
you're it.
That was lame.
Well, cumbersome maybe.
Was that Sarah?
Her machine. In person
I'm even more cumbersome.
Hazard of the job.
Can't tell them what you really do. They
always feel you have something to hide.
Hope you like the single life.
It's what most of us end up with.
- That's good to know.
- Come on, we got something.
This morning we received word from
Filipino Intelligence
that Ruben Carano
is less than 36 hours from completing
a multi-million dollar deal with
the terrorist group Soledad,
for 100 kilos of
compressed Micro Semtex.
Soledad - they're the ones
that blew up that nightclub.
And two Embassies
within the last year.
Micro Semtex is ten times more
powerful than its namesake.
An amount the size
of a nine-volt battery
has a fragmentation
pattern of 100 yards.
It's on the United States
list of banned weapons.
- So where's Carano now?
- We don't know.
He's wanted in nine countries
for illegal weapons sales.
That includes chemical.
This guy will sell anything to anyone.
And he's very shrewd
about his movements.
He's only been spotted once
in the last three years -
by Interpol in Vienna.
Carano stays out of sight
and makes the deals with
his right-hand man -
Alonzo Reed.
Reed and the Soledad
operatives slipped out
of the Philippines
after their meeting.
They could be completing
this deal anywhere.
What about Carano's family?
His wife's deceased.
He has two brothers
and a daughter - all civilians.
Let's put our overseas agents on alert.
This is an opportunity to get
Carano and the terrorists.
Where do you want me on this?
I do speak pretty fair Espanol.
Corner of Fourth and Mass.
Oh.
Carano's daughter has an
art studio at Adams Morgan.
Her name's Theresa.
On the off chance that her
father attempts to contact her,
- we want somebody there.
- It'll be like a stakeout?
You want me to just watch her?
Yeah. Think you can handle it?
Following a girl around for hours?
It'll be just like college.
I'm kidding about that.
I'm totally kidding.
Jake, you can't have
any contact with her.
- Understood?
- Yes, understood. Absolutely.
Good.
No contact.
Just like college.
Okay. Here we go
0900 hours.
Subject is wearing a white tank top.
Looks like she's cleaning a painting.
Looks like water she's using,
I don't know.
- It's kind of behind her.
- Jake, just watch her, okay?
Yeah. Right.
Copy... over.
Oh, damn.
- What now?
- Meter maid.
So what? Just do that nano thing.
I can't. It's mechanical.
Uh, I'm here.
Uh...
um... I don't suppose
you make change?
Right. Okay, just...
I'm going to be right back.
I got it.
Uh... thank you very much. Thank you.
That's... you're very...
good samaritan.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry. Here, let me,
uh... let me pay you back.
Don't worry about it.
It was 50 cents.
No, it was a really nice thing
you did. I really feel like I should.
- Here.
- That's a twenty.
Yeah. Well, the ticket
would have been fifty.
So I figure you saved me thirty.
I am not going to take
your last twenty.
No, no, it's okay, really. You can buy
yourself some new paints or something.
How do you know I paint?
I... uh... well,
because the paint all
over your shirt there,
and I know there's a lot of
art studios around here -
so, you know, put two and two together,
figured you must be an artist.
You're right, sort of.
The painting I do
is mostly restorations.
Oh, restorations, restorations.
Wow, that's...
that's really interesting, isn't it?
It is. I mean, when I tell
most people what I do,
they have no idea.
Well, well, most people.
Yeah, well, restorations
are really important,
'cause they make things...
like new, I'd guess you'd say.
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?
Not really, no.
Would you like me to show you?
Okay.
I think we've got a problem.
See how the light plays on the water?
Yeah.
The only way to really get
that hue is to crush lupine.
Sometimes the most beautiful things
are hidden behind years of neglect.
You peel away the layers
of dirt and grime,
and suddenly, there it is:
The artist's true intention.
So here I am, talking on and on
about myself. What do you do?
Um... I-I, actually, I'm...
kind of into restorations, too.
- How so?
- I restore computers.
"I restore computers"?
I, I, I repair them.
I repair, work on them,
that kind of stuff.
How do you run into the mark
after the first hour?
He didn't try to pick her up, did he?
Sounds like she picked him up.
Mostly bluetooth,
network and operability,
that sort of thing - it's not
really creative like this.
Well, coming up with answers
to problems, that's creative.
I never really thought of it like that.
Maybe you should.
By the way, I'm Theresa Carano.
Oh, I'm... Alan...
Alan Hergott.
- Hergott.
- Yeah, it's an old family name.
My great-grandfather,
he actually left Prussia and...
brought the name with him,
here to America...
long line of Hergotts.
So you always this
nervous around women?
Uh... yeah, pretty much.
She's making him nervous.
I think it's time we got
"Alan Hergott" out of there.
Oh, wow! Look at this!
This is, uh, still
wet. Sorry.
It's okay. It's not quite done.
So, did you always know
you wanted to do this?
Pretty much. I was a business graduate
at Brown first.
International economics.
- It was so dull.
- Then you transferred to art?
No, I graduated and
then switched to art.
Bet that didn't make
your family too happy.
My father's a practical guy.
Really? How so?
He didn't want me to be
like the other women
in the family, dependent on a man.
Yeah, my dad didn't want me
to be dependent on a man, either.
Especially him.
Oh! Look at that. That looks dry.
It's one of mine.
It's a self-portrait.
Oh... then...
- I guess that makes you the...
- Self?
Oh... look at the time.
Oh, yeah, I totally forgot
I have this meeting
with the guys over at TrelCorp.
Yeah, they're still trying to get
by with Centrino processors,
if you can believe that.
Uh... I guess I better go.
Okay.
Okay... well...
thank you for letting me
look at all your work.
- It's really amazing.
- You're welcome.
You know where to find me,
Alan Hergott.
What did I say, "Alan"?
You said no contact.
But she put money in my meter.
- I didn't want to seem rude!
- Rude.
She was being so nice. Okay,
all right, I understand that manners
aren't my first priority on a mission,
- Kyle...
- Okay?
- It just happened.
- Mm-hmm.
What, what, what's
that supposed to mean?
Nothing. You know,
just seems a little aggressive.
You're a total stranger,
she gives you money,
invites you up to her apartment
on the spur of the moment...
Okay, we weren't strangers.
We had the whole parking meter thing,
- we talked about art restoration...
- Uh-huh.
Diane, is it so impossible
for you to believe
that this girl might actually
be interested in me?
Hi.
We have an unconfirmed sighting
of the terrorists in Colombia,
possibly heading North,
and not a single hit from Carano
in the last twelve hours.
I'm sorry. I screwed up.
I think Mr. Alan Hergott can help us.
My sixth grade teacher?
Oh.
Uh, Lou, I don't know
if that's such a great idea.
No, no, no, no, no. It's a
good idea. She likes him.
Yes. Jake can get her to trust him.
I-I really wouldn't want
to use her like that.
Uh, unless, of course,
you wanted me to.
Let's get Mr. Hergott a painting.
Go, Alan.
So, Alan,
- hear you've got a mission.
- Yeah.
What, you're totally not excited?
Not excited about lying to this girl.
Well, you're not really lying.
It's part of the job, right?
The part I'm not very good at.
You're telling me you've
never lied to a girl before?
Never used to.
- Alan.
- Hey. Hi.
Uh, I was wondering
if you could help me.
The composition's subtle but strong.
The palette seems
like it might be good.
It looks like it was painted quickly,
which isn't necessarily a bad thing.
The plenary painters always strove
to get their landscapes
done in one sitting.
What?
Why'd they want to get
them done in one sitting?
They wanted to capture
life, the moment.
They didn't want to put it
in a glass jar for study.
You see these strokes,
how thick the paint is, how bold?
Feel it.
Yeah... it's bold.
Why did you pick this painting?
Uh... well, it's...
I like it 'cause it's open
and, um... simple.
Right.
And that path,
I don't know where it goes, it's...
just kind of goes on forever.
And, uh... and the trees,
they're really tall and dense,
like you could get lost
in there for hours, you know?
Yeah... I do know.
Okay, take off your shirt.
- What?
-Yeah! You're going to help me restore it.
- I am?
- I'll be back in a sec.
I just got to get some
new brushes and paints.
Okay.
- Alan!
- Uh... yeah!
There's some beer in the fridge.
Okay. You want one?
- Sure!
- Okay.
I'm watching him now.
I'll tell you what he's doing:
He's poking around the desk
looking at some mail.
He's definitely a wrong number.
Don't worry, Carano,
I'll find out who he really is
and what he's really up to.
So what exactly am I doing here?
You're cleaning the surface.
That way, when you start painting,
you don't seal in the dirt particles.
- When you start painting...
- No, when we start panting.
Don't be afraid to really push.
Probably not the first
time she said that.
This is going nowhere.
So your parents live in DC?
They used to.
My father travels a lot.
My mom died when I was ten.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What does your dad do?
I-I don't mean to pry.
No, uh, no.
I say he's an importer-exporter.
Oh.
My dad's an arms dealer.
Lou, I think he might've
stumbled onto something.
Uh... an arms dealer?
Wow, that's...
different.
Uh... yeah, pretty different.
It's not something
I tell most people.
You told me.
You're not most people.
I can't imagine what that
must've been like growing up.
It was something.
You know, you get old enough,
you read things in the newspaper.
They can say what
they want about him,
but he never missed
my birthday or a school
play or anything else that mattered.
So, do you still see a lot of him?
Not as much as I'd like.
We talk on the phone.
- He's out of the country.
- Yeah.
I can't keep up with him. He's
always in a different time zone.
He sent me these shoes
a couple weeks ago.
Very nice!
Caracas has the best shoes.
- Caracas.
- Let's get our agents over there
to circulate Carano's photo.
- So, we just start painting now or...?
- Nope.
You see where these rips were?
You have to let the
putty dry overnight.
Oh. So then, I guess...
You have to come back tomorrow.
Oh...
A man fitting Carano's description
left a private compound
in the El Posada
neighborhood of Caracas
three days ago.
Confirmed?
By Venezuelan Intelligence
and Miraflores.
That's the presidential palace.
I didn't know we had someone
in the presidential palace.
Hmm. Yes. The president.
We believe Carano boarded a flight
on El Centro air under
the name Eduardo Garcia.
That plane went to Costa Rica.
Too late for a welcoming committee?
Long gone.
Carano leaves Venezuela
for Costa Rica,
Soledad is rumored to be
heading north into Colombia.
Let's focus our resources here between
El Salvador and Costa Rica.
I believe Carano's going to be meeting
his buyers somewhere in this vicinity.
That's good work.
Thanks. You guys can take it from here?
Don't you and Carano's daughter
have a date tonight?
A... a date? No, no, no.
Hey, no, no, it's not a date,
it's, um...
uh, we're supposed
to work on the painting
- around 8:00. I'll cancel.
- No, you won't.
In fact, I'd like you to go sooner.
Are you sure you need me on this?
'Cause you guys already know
they're in Central America.
You have agents
all over the place, uh...
She talks to her father on the phone.
She told you that herself last night.
We've run traces on her cell,
land line - nothing.
She's communicating
with him somehow.
You want me to find out how.
Nice to see you, too.
Hi. Sorry. Uh...
it's just, you look... amazing.
Thank you. Come in.
Are you allowed
to paint in that dress?
No, we're not painting tonight.
- We're not?
- No.
Uh, the painting still
has to dry another day.
So I figured that there's not much
else to do but eat
and enjoy ourselves.
I hope you're not upset
that I tricked you.
No, no. I'm... delighted.
Something smells really good.
It's the chipotle sauce for dipping.
Relax, make yourself at home.
Okay.
I expect you to be honest.
Tell me if it's too spicy.
- Wow, that's perfect.
- Yeah?
- Mm.
- Good. Let's dance.
No, I don't really...
Wow...
you're a natural.
You're really cute when you do that.
What? Wh-when I do what?
You... scrunch up your forehead
'cause you're concentrating.
- I scrunch?
- Yeah, you do.
Right here.
He called her twice
in the last nine hours.
Santa Ana, San Salvador.
How do we know it was him?
She has a cell phone
on her speed dial,
so when the calls came in,
it said "Papa."
I'm uplinking to the satellite now.
Put it on the big board.
Yeah.
The El Cortez hotel,
top floor, northeast corner.
Got him.
Put rotating teams on that hotel.
When he moves, we move.
Uptown one's in position.
Downtown two,
approaching at nine o'clock.
Carano's on the move.
Copy that.
He left the El Cortez 20 minutes ago.
Is he, uh, is this the handoff?
We'll find out.
- Our guests have arrived.
- I copy.
Looks like the Colombian
posse's meeting on a boat.
You got an I.D. on Carano?
It's a positive.
Our guess is, the semtex
is inside the boat.
Where are the buyers?
So far they're a no-show.
Maybe this isn't the handoff. Maybe
they're just transferring the semtex.
Doesn't look like the folks from
Soledad are coming to the party.
No pressure, boss, but these guys
aren't going to be around forever.
If we get Carano, maybe the semtex,
that's two out of three, and we
put a stop to it for the time being.
No, let's-let's wait one more minute.
I copy.
They're on the move.
- Okay, Peter, let's draw in the net.
- Copy that. Let's go.
Let's go.
NSA! Drop your weapons.
Drop your weapons. Get down!
Get down, Federal Agents!
Vamonos rapido!
Vamonos al bote! Vamonos!
Peter, what's going on?
Peter... what's happening?
Peter?
Looks like a lot of bodies.
Peter? Peter?
We've sustained two injuries,
both minor.
And the Colombians?
Three dead, one wounded.
And Carano - what's Carano's status?
Carano is dead.
Repeat: Carano is dead.
Jake, it's not your fault.
Diane, I put the NSA on to him.
I broke into her phone logs.
I pinpointed his location
- right down to his hotel room.
- Yeah, because you were doing your job!
You had no control over
how this turned out.
No, I knew the risks.
I knew this might happen.
She trusted me,
and now her dad's dead.
Hello?
Theresa.
Theresa, I'm so sorry.
I always knew someday
something like this would happen,
you know? I just can't believe...
he was shot eleven times.
What kind of people do that?
He was shot in the street.
I didn't even get to say good-bye.
- You went to see her?
- Yes.
- Without authorization?
- Yes.
And?
She's a wreck.
The funeral's on Friday.
She's burying him here in
Washington next to her mother.
Well, I'm sorry that
a girl's father had to die,
but I am not sorry that a dangerous
arms dealer is gone,
and you shouldn't be, either.
Is there anything else?
Yes. I want my final report.
Everything on Carano
for the last six years.
Guess you're going to be
here for a while.
I'm Theresa Carano. Theresa...
Are you always this
nervous around women?
My dad travels a lot...
my mom died when I was ten...
my dad's an arms dealer...
I always knew someday
something like this would happen...
He was shot eleven times.
What kind of people do that?
Is this everything?
Yeah.
I'd like permission to see her again.
Permission granted.
Hey, come in.
You don't have to do this...
keep checking up on me.
- Theresa...
- I have something for you.
I finished it. What do you think?
It's beautiful,
but you didn't have to do that.
Yeah, I did. Working on it helped.
Helps.
Anyway, it's all yours now.
It was the one good thing
the last couple of days.
Well, two. You being the other.
Uh...
Theresa... uh...
I'm not good,
and I'm not who you think I am.
What?
I just, I...
I think you deserve to know the truth.
My real name is Jake Foley,
and I don't repair computers.
I'm an agent with the NSA.
The NSA?
Yeah, your father, he's been selling
some very dangerous explosives
to a terrorist group.
We have agents all over
the world looking for him,
and I was assigned to follow you.
Are you joking?
I used you
to help them track him.
Uh...
our agents were the ones
who tried to arrest him
who killed him.
Why are you...
why are you telling me this?
'Cause I care about you.
I-I think you deserve better.
And...
I couldn't live with
myself if I didn't.
Yeah, well, I'm glad you
can live with yourself now.
Are you all right?
Yeah. Never better.
The NSA bought it.
They're out of the picture.
Tell Soledad they can
take delivery tomorrow.
You are good, Carano.
You're right.
Helps that men are
the same everywhere.
They always underestimate the woman.
Theresa.
I'm sorry. I had to come.
I couldn't let you go
through this by yourself.
Maybe... I'll leave if you want me to.
No.
Sorry about what happened to your dad.
Two and a half years ago,
when he really died in Belize...
One of his private planes
changed hands.
There was a forged bill of sale.
He didn't sell that plane. It crashed.
You covered it up.
That day we met,
thought I was watching you.
Turns out, you were watching me...
playing me from the minute you
put the quarter in the meter.
Got it. Don't be afraid to push...
Were you always this
nervous around women?
I'll be back...
I'm guessing you told Alonzo
to find out who was.
- Don't worry, Carano.
- Why are you telling me this?
And that's when you
really start to shine.
My dad's an arms dealer...
The shoes from Caracas,
the PDA out in plain view,
all to make us think dad's
still out there, cutting deals.
Hey, family business.
You make millions running it.
Your father's enemies chase his ghost,
and occasionally someone you hire
to keep that ghost alive gets shot.
Eleven times, to be exact.
Turns out your people were there
watching that little set-up
got back to you faster than
the coroner got back to us.
You're very good.
You know, I was thinking
to myself, if I were you,
how would I get that micro semtex
back into the country
and still keep my $20 million?
I think I'd take it through customs,
right along with dear
old dead, fake dad.
Am I warm?
Kyle, little help.
Everyone, weapons on the ground, now!
- Put it down!
- Hands in the air!
Weapons on the ground, now!
Hands in the air. Hands in the air.
Get down, get down!
Kyle!
Kyle?
I'm all right. Get her!
Look...
I make it a rule never to...
do that.
Jake!
Hi.
What, uh...
whatcha... what are
you doing with that?
Uh... evidence cleared it.
Taking it home.
Oh! It's nice.
- It'll look nice in your place.
- Yeah.
Well, it's my reminder
I can't trust people anymore.
I can't even trust myself you know?
Well, Jake, you can
trust people. Wha...?
Sure.
No, look, wait. Wait,
wait, wait. Wait, wait.
Jake, just listen. Look,
I know for the mission and all that,
yeah, you can't trust anyone,
but that's-that's just your job.
I mean, you don't have
to take that home.
You just... you gotta find moments
with people that you do trust.
You know, and-and people
with whom you can be honest,
and then it keeps you balanced.
You know what I... mean?
Where are you from, anyway?
Bar Harbor, Maine.
What about you?
Akron, Ohio.
- Akron, Ohio!
- Yeah.
What's there to do in Akron, Ohio?
- There's an amusement park.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Hello, Sarah. It's Jake.
A friend of mine got me thinking,
and I need to be honest with you.
I've known you all this time,
and I've never told you how I feel,
how I really feel about you.
I like you.
I've always liked you, Sarah,
and... and not just as a friend.
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
I know it's an important meeting.
I'm wearing a tie. But my car
was on fire.
Yes, fire.
Flames of fire shooting
out of the hood.
And the auto club's taking their
sweet time getting here.
What? What
I-I can't hear... hello?
Hello? Okay, there.
Can you hear me now? Good.
Maybe if I stand here long enough,
we can have a full conversation.
No, I don't think it's
my crappy carrier,
I think it's my cheap, crappy phone.
Just-just... just tell Lou
that I'll be there as soon as
they tow my car, okay?
All right, thank you. Diane,
thank you. You're the best.
Wow. Nice car.
Uh... yeah.
Yeah. It's a 355 spider.
You like cars?
I like this car.
What's not to like? It's a beauty.
Eight cylinder, six-speed engine.
Smooth grain leather.
You know these things are
assembled entirely by hand.
You're right.
What's not to like?
All right, call for a tow?
Just a, uh... Yeah. Right here.
Right. Where you want me
to haul this steaming pile,
garage or straight to the junkyard?
Garage would be fine. Thanks.
Sorry. My car broke...
broke down.
Hope you brought cash, Romeo.
Your membership's expired.
What?
Man...
What's going on?
Uh... someone's just
hacked into our accounts.
What? What are you talking about?
We're being robbed.
They've got a million.
How? Th-this is a restricted system.
- Million and a half.
- Stop them.
I can't.
The United States Federal Reserve:
$300 billion.
A big marble building
to keep track of it:
$10 million
Stealing $2 Million from the Man:
Priceless
That's me. Jake Foley,
I'm in Tech Support.
Security Clearance:
Low.
Very low.
Then one day, it all changed.
Life just got real interesting.
James Bond, Napoleon Solo,
Steve Austin.
You never saw any of those
guys count pennies for a tow.
Okay, you can't compare
yourself to Steve Austin.
He was a man barely alive.
They had to rebuild him.
Laugh it up. My auto repair estimates
come in as bad as I think
they are, I'm gonna be
the world's first
ride-sharing superspy.
Okay, (A) ride sharing? Hello?
It's an idea whose time has come.
And (B) eventually they're
gonna give you a company car.
- What? Really? When?
- Oh, yeah,
in a couple years.
Oh, great. Well, maybe
by then, Human Resources
will have processed my R-12 form,
and I'll start getting paid.
You know, I made more when I was
de-fragging hard drives around here
than I do fighting Uncle Sam's
enemies. And you know why?
Two words: Overtime.
Yeah, uh, Uncle Sam's enemies
don't punch a clock. Come on.
This M.O. matches a cyber-criminal gang
- we've been tracking.
- Ooh, guys.
Our intel on them is limited.
They're pretty clever.
This isn't the Bedford Falls
Savings & Loan.
This is the Federal Reserve
Bank of the United States.
The people of this country depend on us
to keep their tax dollars
safe from criminals,
even the very clever ones.
We have our best people
on this. We'll get a lead.
We already have one. Look.
This crest is from
Ironhawk Knight Quest.
Could be a fifth-level mage.
Not really sure about the...
Ironhawk Knight Quest?
It's an online role-playing game.
Okay, thousands of people
can play at the same time.
I'd put money on it
you spend enough time poking
around in that environment,
you're eventually gonna find this guy.
Oh, you're throwing
fireballs at me now,
is that how it's gonna be?
Well, bring it on, little man.
Is he still playing that on-line game?
He cut off my leg!
18 hours and counting.
This better be the guy.
Please tell me we're close.
We are. We're running a reverse
IP lookup on that wizard,
but the player is re-routing his signal
through offshore data havens.
We just have to keep
him online a little longer.
Not longer, you're killing me.
I haven't slept,
I haven't showered,
and I have one leg.
Why don't you just use
that dagger thing?
You, go away. Now. Now.
We've got him.
Oh. Thank god.
Ow.
Five, four,
three, two,
one.
Get away from the desk, Dumont!
Hands where I can see
them now. Come on!
I saw you on my security cameras.
Your cover formation is sloppy.
Your men have the weaver
stance all wrong.
I deserve better for my tax dollars.
Jake...
- he's erasing the hard drive.
- What?
Don't even try. It's over.
How'd he do that?
That's your tax dollars at work.
You get what you pay for.
Get him out of here.
I want my lawyer
Uh-oh.
What's wrong?
Well, it's asking for a password.
Can't you just do your thing?
No, I can't just do my thing
'cause the password's
not in the computer,
it's in his head.
You know what I love about passwords?
It can take years to figure them out.
You named your cell phone "Fionavar,"
your mp-3 player "Earthsea,"
your PDA "Gondor."
All your passwords are kings
in those fantasy novels.
Foley, you're embarrassing yourself.
Oh, now when I saw your hard
drive was named "gormenghast,"
now that really narrowed things down.
'Cause it could've Titus groan,
or it could've been his
dad lord sepulchrave...
It takes more than an underpaid
tech grub to crack me.
Well, then I-I pictured you
at your computer with
your little black chair
and sunglasses.
And I realized that
your password could only be
the Death Owl.
You're bluffing.
Well, thanks, Death Owl,
'cause this underpaid
tech grub just got you
to hand over your password.
Foley...
you're talented,
but when you wake up tomorrow
you're still gonna be the same
government droid sellout.
- You're still gonna be in that cell.
- Don't bet on it.
You know the difference between
you and me? I've lived.
I've been to every continent,
and I've eaten every food,
and I've had hotter sex
than you'll ever know...
and when I get out
with the sole mission
to personally frag your ass
for depriving me of that,
you're still gonna be the same
thrift-store- clothes-wearing,
six-dollar-haircut loser
I see before me.
Here's what Jake found
in Dumont's computer.
There are four other hackers in the ring.
They don't use their real names.
The two virus engineers
call themselves Clu and Bit.
Telco specialist is Yori.
And the one with the online
handle "MacP" plans the jobs.
He wants the others to meet
him in Berlin in two days.
They're willing to risk
a meeting this soon
after robbing the Federal Reserve?
- What is he planning?
- Well, I suggest to place
someone undercover in
Dumont's place and find out.
- They've never seen him?
- No, they never met in person.
They're so paranoid,
they haven't exchanged photos.
It's all e-mails, IRC chats,
numbered Cayman accounts.
What do we know about this Dumont?
Got a Ph.D. at 15.
Recruited to write
software for Banatech.
Six months in, he quits.
Dumont accussed Banatch
of stealing his ideas.
He's been underground ever since.
All right, make a list.
Who's available,
who's qualified, who fits the profile.
Ah, if ever an assignment
screamed Agent Foley...
- I don't think so, Jake.
- Oh, why not?
I found Dumont, I cracked
his hard drive. I can do this.
No, Jake, we're talking
about going overseas
and infiltrating a criminal gang.
Agents train for years
to do this type of duty.
Yeah, but these aren't drug dealers.
They're not terrorists.
They're nerds. They're like...
they're like nerds gone wild.
These are my people.
Okay, what's your in?
I show up, wait for them to contact me.
- Now when they do?
- Get them talking.
- Wrong. - Don't you want me
to find out about the job?
Let the information come to you, Jake.
- Observe and gather.
- What if they're not buying it?
What if they start
asking me questions?
Well, you tell me.
- I walk away.
- You walk away.
Where's your primary safe house?
Lisberger apartments
number 98 Alexanderplatz
- Secondary.
- 221-B Backer Strasse.
Good.
Okay, passport...
wallet...
euro dollars.
- Wow, these are cool.
- Jake.
Right. I'm listening.
Your cell phone functions
as a streaming video transmitter.
Show us what they look like, okay?
- Where are you gonna keep it?
- Uh, my coat lining.
No, it's a cell phone.
Right. It's a phone.
Treat it like a phone.
Where'd you go to school?
Carnegie Mellon for undergrad,
cal tech for my masters,
Doctorate at MIT and did my
thesis on heuristic algorithms.
Too much information.
Never give them enough
to catch you in a lie.
Weapons.
I can't take any.
That's right.
You'll be alone and unarmed.
Jake, I think I've told you
everything I can.
From now on, your best defense,
your only defense...
is knowing Dumont inside out.
You have twelve hours to become him.
Hi, I'm Dumont.
Dumont
Yeah. That's good.
I'm Dumont.
Yeah, I ride bikes.
Different one every day. Today?
Well, today's the KTM-525 SX, Babe.
Yeah.
Like the wind.
Oh! Hey!
My car.
Wir mochten mit ihnen sprechen.
Commen sie mit
German intelligence.
You are under arrest.
Look, I told you,
my name is Kevin Flynn.
I don't know who this "Dumont" is.
Don't patronize us.
Dumont is your online handle.
We know you robbed
the American Federal Reserve.
And we know you're working
with at least four others,
attacking systems,
rerouting transfers,
appropriating millions.
And you will give us their names.
I swear I don't know
what you're talking about.
Every nation in the european union
has a jail cell ready for you.
If you don't cooperate, you may
find yourself in every one of them.
That's a nice watch.
We are not here to discuss watches.
We want names.
And we are quickly losing our patience.
The building seems kind of empty.
German Intelligence on some
kind of a holiday or something?
Wal... Walther PPK. I thought...
I thought James Bond was the only
guy who still used one of those.
Oh, you think you're smart?
Think you can outsmart the bullet?
That's a line from "Robocop".
What's going on here? You guys learn
everything you know from movies?
We're so busted!
Hey, way to ace
the loyalty test, Dumont.
I'm Bit, this is Clu.
Hey, who'd you believe more?
Oh,
clearly you're both evil geniuses.
Hey, this is 50,000 euros.
That's courtesy of McP.
The only caveat is:
spend it all by dawn.
Is this some silent zen torture?
I was just thinking.
Oh.
That would explain
the long silent patches.
You're a bright guy.
Are you bright enough to understand
that the only way out is to cut a deal?
What have I said or done to make
you think I would cut a deal?
Oh...
you're pitching a deal
'cause you're worried.
You sent little Jake
in my place, didn't you?
That's a bad poker face, Agent Duarte.
Qui tacet consentire videtur.
"He who is silent is
understood to agree."
You know, it's because
of people like you
that I love the Patriot Act.
I hope you kissed him good-bye.
Because even if he
manages to fool them,
which he won't for too long,
the temptation will be too much
for the little bag-biter to resist.
I know it was for me.
Yeah, right.
Oh, and Dumont -
besame el culo.
This place used to be headquarters
for east berlin communist youth.
Now you can't get a drink
here for less than 20 euros.
Wow. Ausgezeichnet.
Excellent. Carry on.
Enschuldigen sie bitte.
Uh, is this the end of the line?
Dude, what are you doing?
Right.
Come on.
We don't do lines.
Look who we brought.
Aha!
Family's complete.
Hey, about time.
How you doing, brother?
How was your flight, man
- Good.
- Good.
Finally, in the flesh.
Dumont?
Yori.
You're not what I expected.
- What'd you expect?
- Less.
- Come on!
- Come on!
Come on, man! Bring it on!
Come on, man! Another round.
You got the shots?
Put on some liederhosen!
Bring your sister. Bring your sister.
Temping was the worst.
Anything goes wrong, they blame you.
Dranzacom fired me
because they thought
I was stealing post-its.
Well, that and I wouldn't sleep
with the homunculus office manager.
Nothing's as bad as a render farm -
herding pixels 24 hours a day
for nothing.
I couldn't even afford a new futon.
I slept on a used one.
Hey, at least you had a bed.
Try sleeping on a flea-infested couch
while your less talented,
more politically savvy friends
are peddling IPOs.
Oh!
Yeah, okay, okay.
Uh, m-my first I.T. job,
I-I had these two bosses
that second-guessed
everything that I did.
And they give me a "promotion"
and take away my overtime.
I'm driving this old,
rusty piece of junk car,
I live above a 24-hour deli.
To this day, the smell of fried peppers
makes me homicidal.
That surprises me, Dumont.
I can't imagine you as an I.T.
Yeah, I'm trying to forget it.
Hey, here's to not spending
80 hours a week
putting away code in a cubicle,
never wearing a tie
and never being poor.
And to doing it on our own terms,
ladies and gentlemen!
Oh, yeah! Ow! That's right!
Cheers.
Oh-oh, yeah!
Oh!
This yours?
Vid phone.
Real-time data stream.
Cool!
Yeah!
Yeah! Woo!
Hi. Yeah!
What the hell is he doing?
I think it's the slip.
It's this dance...
more like a grind, actually.
It's very popular
in the mitte district.
Not helping. Right.
These are the players?
We assume. He didn't bother
to label the photos
or contact us three hours ago
like he was supposed to.
Let's see if we can photo-match
ID any of these guys.
Working on it.
Why is Jake in all of his photos?
I have no idea.
How much lead time does German
Intelligence need to mount a raid?
- Thirty minutes.
- Well, we can wait for Jake
to figure out what they're planning,
or we can go in there now and
nail them for the Federal reserve.
Alert the Germans.
We're getting him out of there.
Dude, your phone.
Thanks!
What?
You're beautiful.
This is it.
He's at the bar.
- He's here.
- Yeah.
You want me to do it or are you gonna?
Uh, well, you know, whatever.
- Okay, so you give him the 30.
- Got it.
The-the 30,000. Is that all?
That's what we talked about, right?
He's not going to jack you, is he?
- Better not.
- All right, here we go.
- It's all there?
- Yeah, it's all there.
Don't try to jack us.
What?
Don't you have something for me?
He took off from Heathrow
six minutes ago.
He took off from
Heathrow six minutes ago.
We're going to change the world, bro.
Yeah, that we are.
Hey, guys! Guys, we're on.
Dumont just got the word.
- Awesome!
- It's on? Now?
Hey, listen, I just...
I really have to...
I'm going to go.
I'll be just a minute.
Hey, what's going on?
- Why haven't I heard from you?
- All right, just listen.
He left Heathrow airport
six minutes ago.
Uh, well, no. Eight, I guess.
What are you talking about?
Uh, I don't know. I don't know.
Uh. It's a plane.
I think that there's
something big this time.
No, Jake, listen.
We're getting you out.
German Intelligence
is moving in ten minutes.
No, no, no, they can't.
This thing's already in motion.
Who are you?
I don't know what game you're playing,
Dumont, but I'm not interested.
What, what game?
We've been doing it online
for six months, okay?
I don't need you to tell
me I'm beautiful.
Save the compliments
for somebody who needs it.
Wait, wait.
We're not online anymore.
You're breaking all the rules.
No eye contact, no real names.
We're breaking the rules.
Guys...
we got work to do.
What's the target?
Get in.
Come on. Give us a hint.
Guess we're going down.
We're going way down.
What's that beeping?
I-I'm sorry. It's Jake.
What just happened?
All his numbers just disappeared.
What does that mean, he's dead?
I don't know. He's just gone.
German Intelligence
just raided the club.
There's no sign of the hackers.
No sign of Jake.
How is that possible?
They went out of satellite
range. I don't...
maybe they went underground.
Have them send us a subterranean grid
of all sewers and tunnels
in the vicinity.
Get me manifests of all
flights coming into Berlin.
Priority match anything that came out
of Heathrow in the last half hour.
Cool...
we are in the bat cave.
No, dude. We're in Hitler and
Eva Braun's love bunker.
We're inside a concealed lead-lined,
nuclear fallout shelter that
hasn't seen the light of day
since the Berlin wall came down.
This is really cool. You think we can
get back to the club and keep drinking?
What are we doing?
There must be 100 asbestos-free,
nicely-ventilated places
we could do this.
There is no place as safe
from satellite surveillance,
thermal imaging, and sonar
and radio interference.
So buckle your seat belts,
ladies and gentlemen.
Excuse me.
Boys and girls, may I present
three tons of supercomputing
magnificence.
A teraflop machine.
A multi-teraflop machine.
What is that -
like, 60 billion
calculations per second?
- Look at the size of that thing.
- I am in love.
Our target is Banatech.
My old stomping ground.
Nice. I've been wanting
to get back at those wipes
ever since they started charging
for their stupid upgrades.
- Buggy software.
- I temped there for a couple of weeks
trying to lift the code off the beta
version of their new browser.
- How'd you make out?
- I didn't.
They've got the firewall
of death. I don't care
how many teraflops we've got here.
You're right. It's impossible
to crack their firewall.
But not their executive jet.
Right now, all of Banatech's
top management are on it,
flying in from Heathrow
to a conference in Berlin.
When that jet enters German airspace,
we are going to crack its fly-by wire,
forcing it to circle and circle...
Losing fuel
until their top brass
transfer their fortunes
into our Cayman accounts.
We're talking "b" as in billions!
Catch me. I'm gonna faint.
Good.
So, guys... uh, we don't
have a lot of time.
Please, start your software.
Be careful.
Dumont,
can I have a word?
Where are my manifests?
We've got 22 printing now.
The Germans just sent us
the underground grids.
It's a mess: Miles and miles of
cold war bunkers and tunnels.
Tell 'em to start looking.
Here they are.
I got to say, man,
I doubted you.
You were right, man.
They bought everything.
They bought everything
like a bag of chips.
You got everything else locked down?
What else is there?
Cayman accounts?
You said we didn't need them.
And by the time this is done,
it's going to be pretty obvious
we didn't do this for the money.
We got all the money we need.
In your own words, "the only thing
we don't have is infamy."
You want to do the toast?
To crashing a plane.
To crashing a plane full of toads.
It's all you, Dumont.
You are a genius.
We're in the system. We're ready
to take that plane when you are.
Nice!
Agent Duarte,
Dumont says he knows
about the hackers' plans,
but he'll only talk to you.
Let's go.
You come in.
What I have to say
is for your ears only.
Open it.
You seem pretty tense.
How's it going?
Do you have something
to tell me or not?
Just this.
Tell me about the plane!
He asks for me again, you tase him.
Right.
Open it.
- Say the magic word.
- Give it to me! Give it to me!
Say it now!
He slipped.
Got the navigational beacon.
Dumont, crack the fly-by wire
whenever you're ready.
Just a sec.
- We've got a problem.
- Yes, we do.
Upper management of Banatech
is flying into Berlin as we speak.
The company Dumont hates.
What is that?
Someone's trying to send us a message
through one of our secure uplinks.
I think it's coming from Berlin.
It's Jake.
Get Berlin air traffic control.
Find that plane and land them, now!
Dumont, what are you doing?
Waiting for the ping to
come back from the 5-0-1.
We got that five minutes ago.
Look, it's right there.
Now, take the damn plane.
No.
Why not?
What's-what's going on?
Who's trying to upload a message?
Check your e-mail at home, guys.
This is Berlin control
requesting an immediate
emergency landing
Tower, this is charter November X-Ray
seven-four-two-zero-five.
This communication
is highly irregular.
I need a reason to initiate
an emergency landing.
Fly-by-wire's been bypassed.
Manual override's out.
We don't have control of the plane.
How do we get control of that plane?
Get a secure line
to Berlin Intelligence.
German air traffic control
should have a code
to override the fly-by-wire
and release that plane.
They're gonna crash...
in ten minutes.
Dude, how could you?
Because you're all being used.
You weren't brought here
to hold that plane hostage.
You were brought to crash it.
- What?
- He's lying.
Yeah, tell them about
the Cayman accounts.
There aren't any!
This isn't about money.
This is all about
Dumont getting back at Banatech.
Who you gonna believe?
Your friend who's made you millions
or this U.S. government wage slave?
Look, I've met Dumont.
You know he can make you
believe anything that he wants.
He's got you isolated.
His lackey's got a gun.
You really believe
he meant for you to
get out of this alive?
Okay, let's rethink this.
It's not worth it till we know
who's telling the truth.
Do you all feel that way?
Okay, then.
No, no!
I feel differently.
Ich bin Louise Beckett.
Ich muss mit ihren direktor sprechen.
You're pretty good, huh -
as a hacker and a social engineer.
Buy you'll never be a player.
You better pray.
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
This is November X-Ray
Seven-Four-Two-Zero-Five.
We are unable to maintain
control of the equipment.
Ja, ich verstehe.
The hackers have locked the Germans
out of their own system.
They can't input the override code.
But Jake can.
Wir benotigen seinen code.
Wir benotigen seinen code.
It's gonna be okay.
Not for you, it's not.
What did you do to my computer?
We got it back.
We have control of the plane.
Pull up. Just pull up!
This is November X-Ray
Seven-Four-Two-Zero-Five
requesting immediate
landing clearance, please.
He did it.
Anything more you can tell us,
Agent Foley?
Yeah, I don't know.
Uh... excuse me.
I'm sorry about the way
things turned out.
You've got nothing to be sorry for.
Uh, my real name is Rachel.
Jake.
What?
Nothing. It's just funny, you know.
I just rode to work
with the world's first
ride-sharing superspy.
Yeah, well, I hear ride-sharing's
an idea whose time has come.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
- Huh. I'll see ya.
- Okay.
How was Berlin, Jake?
Miss me?
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
See this? It's what
I use to monitor Jake
and track his vitals
and stuff like that.
It's technology at its best.
- Jake!
- Sarah!
- Who's the girl?
- Oh, it's Sarah.
Georgetown Sarah?
Lived in the same dorm
for four years and never
asked her out - Sarah?
That's the one.
See how the nanites
have positioned themselves
along his central nervous system?
What they're doing is establishing
contact with the brain.
The lab mice experienced muscle spasms.
In rare cases, they
rejected the nanites
and the result's not good.
What is going to happen to me?
I received your message.
I will meet you at the restaurant.
Hmm.
Buon giyrno, Lorenzo.
Come sta? Bene?
Ciao, Maria.
Antonio... piccolo
Antonio bebe laco
Antonio?
Antonio?
Oh, my god. Jake.
Come on. Come on, Jake.
Oh!
Jake! Wh... are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine.
What are you doing here?
Well, I was worried about you.
I checked your vitals,
and they-they showed...
Oh, no.
What?
Um...
my screen is frozen.
I'm sorry.
Oh, my god.
That's me. Jake Foley,
I'm in Tech Support.
Security Clearance: Low.
Very low.
Then one day, it all changed.
Life just got real interesting.
Fran, we need to run
another diagnostic screen.
We've just run one.
Yeah. Well, his vitals are fading fast,
so we need to run another one.
Okay, okay, the screen, I know.
It was my fault, but there
was more to the story.
- I certainly hope so.
- Yeah.
See that mouse?
That's Antonio, who, unfortunately,
remains in the same state
in which I found him this morning -
that is, paralyzed.
Can I show you something?
This particular
side effect has occurred
on rare occasions in beta
versions of the nanites,
but never before
in this latest version.
- Is that what's in...
- Antonio. Yes.
It's also what's in Jake.
- In fact, they're twins.
- Twins?
Yeah. They were injected
on the same day,
which is why... why I'm concerned.
Is Jake showing any symptoms?
- Well... no, but...
- Dr. Hughes,
because if he is, I...
I need to know about it.
- Okay.
- I'm quite serious.
I can't afford to have Jake
being a risk out in the field.
Do you understand?
Yes. Of course.
Good.
Keep your eye on him.
Well, that's not going to be easy.
- Departure time?
- 9:00 A.M.
- What's the flight number?
- Flight 10-11.
Hmm, that sounds really familiar.
Sarah, you're not going
to believe this.
- We are on the exact same flight.
- Great.
Mm-hmm. Hey,
are you staying at that inn -
- what's that place called?
- No. I'm staying at the Bay Lodge.
Yeah. I thought the lodge
looked better, too.
We can share a car.
Sure. Sure we can share a car.
That's a great idea.
- Okay. Friday at 10:00.
- See ya.
Jake.
Yes?
- Could I have a word?
- Sure.
Ow!
How could this come as a surprise?
I put my request in to Human
Resources three weeks ago.
Well, unbeknownst to Human Resources,
you have a half billion dollars'
worth of research inside of you.
Research that many people
would like to get their hands on.
It's a wedding.
- You're still at risk.
- From what,
drunken bridesmaids?
Lou, I woke up this morning
with guns in my face.
What's next,
sidearm chaperones on dates?
Permission to go potty?
It's for your own protection, Jake.
And I appreciate that,
but I need to have
a life outside of this.
My friend is getting married.
I'm his best man.
Please.
All I'm asking for here is two days.
Two days of a normal life.
Sarah, hey.
Glad this worked out.
I, uh... you know, it's great
about Kevin and Jen. I like you.
Hey, Sarah, hey.
Glad this worked out with
the car and the whole flight.
Maybe we could go out
sometime and cut the rug...
it's funny how, you know,
they've been friends for so long,
and we've been friends for so long -
not that we should get married.
I'm not saying that.
Definitely not saying that.
Sorry I'm late.
Hey!
I just got caught up, and... anyway.
Don't worry about it - I'm just
glad this whole thing worked out.
So, pretty great about Kevin and Jen.
Been friends for so long,
getting married. It's amazing.
Yeah. I knew eventually
they'd figure it out.
- Yeah.
- Okay, so we got to go.
Oh. Okay. Um, listen...
- We have all day to talk.
- Yeah.
- Hi.
- Oh, uh, Jake, Alex. Alex, Jake.
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah. You, too.
Um, let me sit in the middle.
Oh, you guys, this weekend's
going to be so much fun.
- Yeah, it's going to be great.
- Okay.
Dude...
Hey, man, how's it going?
What's up, Kev?
Yeah! Whoa!
Can't believe you're still wearing
the same old ratty jacket.
Yeah, yeah. I can't believe
you're still losing your hair.
Hey! Let's not hit
a guy below the belt on his wedding.
So... finally happened.
Yeah, a lot quicker than
I expected, believe me.
I thought for sure I was going
to be the last one to go.
No, no, apparently, that's me.
Speaking of which, am I
the only single person here?
What happened? I thought
you were coming with Sarah.
You know, that didn't
exactly work out as planned.
Uh-huh.
You still haven't
told her how you feel.
- It's all about timing.
- Right, yeah, years and years of timing.
Come on, buddy, step off the ledge.
- I mean, look, it happened with Jenny.
- You stalked her.
Whatever. She said yes.
Hey, oh, listen, um,
just go grab yourself a drink,
and, um, I'll go find my bride.
She's dying to see you.
Thanks for coming.
- Okay, man.
- Okay. See you tomorrow.
Hey, Fran?
- Can you do me a favor?
- What?
If, uh, if we're asked any questions
about the mice or Jake...
just let me know first.
- Yeah.
- Thanks.
Yep. Having fun.
Aww, finally, a familiar face. Hey.
I swear, I've been meeting relatives
I didn't even know existed.
- Jen, you look beautiful.
- Thank you.
You're much too beautiful for this guy.
Well, what can I say?
Geeks turn me on.
- Yeah. Ha!
- Hmm.
So, a lot of people are looking
forward to that toast.
- Oh, yeah, how is that coming, by the way?
- Uh, it's,...
um, right in here.
- You got nothing.
- Not a word.
Oh, Jake.
Honey, Aunt Lois wants to see you.
Oh, is she sober?
Uh, for the moment,
so now's a good time.
- Okay.
- Good luck.
Hey, hey, who's that guy over there?
Well, who are you talking about?
The guy walking away -
he's been looking at me.
Oh, that's probably my cousin Phil.
He's a really weird dude.
Hey. He's single. Ha.
Ha-ha. Jerk.
Oh, great.
That's me.
Oh, hi. Um...
Oh, here, you want to, uh...
have a seat.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
I'm Jake Foley.
- Nice to meet you, Jake Foley.
- You, too
are you bride or groom?
Bride - we work together.
Ah. Groom - best man.
So, I, uh, guess they...
meant for us to meet.
Hey, baby.
Honey! I'd like you to meet Jake.
Jake, this is Rachel,
my partner.
- Did you see that one?
- Yeah.
Isn't that funny. With the beard.
I don't know what's going on.
What am I doing?
No, no, no.
Alex, stop. That tickles.
Oh, how about this?
Oh, that's perfect.
How about here?
Idiot. Idiot.
All right, all right.
Hello.
Jake, hey, it's Diane.
What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Really?
I just noticed some
nanite activity, so...
Diane, you're monitoring
me at a wedding.
I'm sorry, Jake. It's my job.
I know. I know, I know. I'm sorry.
- It's just... it's just...
- What?
Nothing. It's nothing.
Jake...
I don't know, I guess I'm just
frustrated, you know. I'm here,
all my friends are here and they're
all moving on with their lives.
They're all...
falling in love and
they're having families
and it's just so clear
that I'm going nowhere.
Jake, listen, all these things
that you're feeling -
they're... they're very common. I mean,
just about everybody experiences
them at one time or another.
I mean, in med school we
even coined a term for it.
Oh, yeah, what's that?
Yeah, "single syndrome."
Is it fatal?
No. It's just mildly depressing.
In the meantime,
just try and get some sleep, okay?
- Thanks, Diane.
- Good night.
Good night.
Who is it?
Hi.
Hey.
You're surprised.
A little bit.
Well, I checked with an expert
on the whole single syndrome thing,
and he said you should never
go to a wedding without a date.
So here I am.
I mean, not as your date -
just as a friend posing as your date.
Diane, uh, you didn't have to...
No, no, I know. I had all
these frequent-flier miles
and I kind of always wanted
to see Seattle, so...
I can't believe you flew
all the way out here.
Yeah.
So you're buying breakfast.
Oh, so the whole bouquet thing -
it's like why don't you
just shine a spotlight
down on all the single,
desperate women whose entire
fate lies in the hands of this bride
just blindly throwing
flowers over her head.
And then you have me. I mean, at my height,
do you think I even stand a chance?
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
I don't think I can eat this.
What? Why not?
My stomach's all in knots.
- Really, since when?
- I don't know. Uh, a couple days ago.
- Okay, well, is it... is it?
- Put it away!
- Jake, this could be serious.
- It's not serious.
It's the wedding toast, okay?
This happens every time
I have to speak in public.
Sorry.
Can I help at all?
No, no, I'm beyond help.
It's like watching a train wreck.
It's okay. Everyone expects a disaster,
and I deliver every time.
Jake. Dude, paint ball.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Paint ball?
Yeah, it's kind of a tradition.
You know, the whole battle before
the battle type of thing. You okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Okay.
- Let's go.
- C'mon.
David.
Redner.
Jesse.
Meeks.
Uh... Shefflin.
Spider.
Later, Foley.
Okay, guys, listen up.
This may very well be the last time
I get to see all of you guys...
without permission.
But, and despite of the fact
that we are all about to go to war,
let's not forget we came
here to have some fun, okay?
So remember, safety first, guys.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
That doesn't count, does it?
That's my best man.
Okay, guys, let's do it.
Oh, Fran. It's Diane.
Anything on Antonio?
Not yet. I'm still reviewing
the backup data.
- Okay, so you'll let me know?
- Yeah.
So, how's Jake?
Oh, he's fine. I feel kind of silly.
Well, it's better that you went anyway.
Yeah. So listen, call me
when you're done, okay?
All right.
Honey. We're right over here.
- They already started.
- Okay, started what?
- Oh, no thank you, but this really
- Honey...
This is so not my thing.
Looking glamorous is
every woman's thing.
Oh, thank you. Ooh.
Okay.
You're a dead man, Foley!
- Who've you got?
- It's just Foley.
This is going to be easy.
Okay, you flank right. I'll go left.
He'll have nowhere to run.
On three, ready?
One... two... three.
Well, that was easy.
Damn.
Mani-pedi's one of life's
greatest pleasures.
I'm a virgin.
Well, I'm a mani-pedi virgin.
It's my first time.
- You're kidding?
- No.
I always thought they were
like a big waste of time.
And now I see that that's the point.
Oh, exactly.
I'm Sarah Carter.
Oh... Oh, hi.
Oh, I'm so sorry!
I'm Diane Hughes. I'm really sorry.
- Don't worry about it. Don't worry.
- Oh, god.
So are you with the bride or the groom?
Oh, the groom... I guess.
Although I haven't actually met him.
I'm with Jake.
- Jake Foley?
- Yeah.
- We went to college together.
- Yeah, I know.
He's mentioned you to me before...
once.
Just once.
Oh, uh...
that's so weird, 'cause we
rode to the airport together
and he never mentioned bringing a date.
Well, I'm not actually
his date. I'm his doctor.
Well, I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor.
So it was a last minute thing.
I guess so.
So how'd you meet?
Just at work.
So you're a doctor at the NSA?
Mm-hmm. Yes, Research.
That must be really interesting.
Yeah.
What kind of research do you do?
Oh, I'm in...
I am not allowed to tell you.
It's a... confidentiality thing.
- Right.
- Sarah!
Um... oh, Valerie's open.
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yeah.
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.
Hey, Jake.
All right, all right, you got me.
Hey, fella...
I think you've got to turn down
your pressure a little bit.
What's the matter, Jake, you afraid?
Seriously, man, you're
going to hurt somebody.
Exactly.
Jake, where you going?
Hey, Jake, come back.
I just want to talk.
Hey, Jake, wait up, Jake.
Fantastic.
Absolutely beautiful.
You've outdone yourself.
Hi. I'm all yours.
Okay.
Aw, Jake, where you been?
I've got this little thing
today - it's called a wedding.
Your cousin Phil is out
of his freakin' mind.
- Yeah, so?
- Seriously.
- He was trying to hurt me out there.
- With paint balls?
Yeah.
- Paint balls?
- Yes. Yes.
- My cousin, Phil?
- Yeah...
- That's Phil?
- Yeah.
Hey. I'm Jake.
You think maybe you were
a little aggressive out there?
Yeah, there's nothing
like a good hunt, huh?
Yeah. Fun, fun, maybe for you.
I had you until that jump.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
Uh... well, it was
a lot lower than it looked.
Yeah, I guess it was.
Hey, I didn't catch your name.
See you at the wedding.
- Paul, where's Jake?
- I don't know.
Oh, man.
Well, unbeknownst to human resources
you have a half billion dollars
worth of research inside of you.
Research that a lot of people
would like to get their hands on.
There's nothing like a good hunt, huh?
You are still at risk.
It's for your own safety.
Secure line to Deputy
Director Louise Beckett.
What? Uh, oh, yeah. Uh,
Alpha Charlie Tango 4271.
No, no, no, listen,
this is an emergen... hello?
Hi. Have you noticed
all the activity outside?
That's my daughter's wedding beginning.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'll be right there.
I need you to call the police.
May I ask why?
Yeah. 'Cause there's a guy in room 214
who's trying to kill me, that's why.
That was 214?
Yes. Yes. Room 214.
Dude... Jake... what is your deal, man?
Everyone in there is waiting on you.
I'm sorry. Just give me one second.
Jake, dude, you're my best man, okay?
I'm kind of freaking out here.
I really need you.
He needs you.
Okay? You're right.
You're right, let's go.
Call them now.
- I think she's up ahead on the right.
- What?
Diane, your date. We met.
Oh, great.
She seems really, um...
interesting.
Yeah. Yes, she is.
You keep a good secret, Jake.
What?
I looked across the room
and I thought to myself,
"that girl is totally out of my reach."
Jenny,
being with you has taught
me how to love
and be loved.
Makes realize
nothing is beyond my reach.
Jake...
Jake...
ring.
Oh. Yeah. Sorry.
Here you go.
Jenny...
I love you.
Oh, man.
That was beautiful.
Fran!
Deputy Director Beckett called.
She's checking up on Jake.
What do I say?
Fran, don't tell her where I am.
Tell her I'll call her back.
May this beautiful day
shine eternally in your lives.
May it add brilliance
to every achievement
and cast a divine light
over any misfortune.
Yeah, come on, come on, come on.
And...
may all that is virtuous,
beautiful and honest
remain in your lives.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor
to introduce you to...
Kevin and Jenny,
husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
It starts with the muscles.
First you think it's just tension.
What are you talking about?
Poison.
It's in your water bottle.
You were very thirsty.
Spreads to the eyes and the ears...
and soon there'll be nothing left.
Not even the nanites can help you.
It's not worth the fight, Jake.
You're already dead.
Fran, it's Diane. Do you have
anything on Antonio?
Yeah, there was an abnormal
increase in nanite activity
around the interior cortex.
But this is where it gets weird.
On his brain, Antonio had a massive
cluster of nanites in his frontal lobe.
Oh, no. No.
What happened?
Where is he?
Where's Jake?
- You know Jake Foley?
- Yes. What happened?
Well, that's what we're
trying to find out.
Mr. Foley was seen on security camera
breaking into one of the rooms.
- What? Why?
- We have no idea.
Jake.
Diane, get out of here. He's after me.
Jake, no one is after you.
- No, he's trying to kill me.
- Jake...
Jake, listen to me. It's the nanites.
The nanites are killing you.
What?
Okay, okay go and lay down, okay?
Okay? Oh... lay down.
Okay, don't worry, Jake.
We're going to figure this out, okay?
- Diane. Diane.
- What?
- Diane.
- What?
Diane...
he's here. He's in the room.
Jake, Jake, listen to me.
What you are seeing is not real.
Diane, he's right behind you.
No. No, this is all in your mind.
The nanites are rejecting you.
They are overloading your brain
with electrical impulses
and making you see things
that are not there.
Jake, look, I need you to see this.
That's got to be uncomfortable.
Okay, up.
I got this from hotel security.
It's from earlier today.
Who are you talking to?
- He was there.
- No.
No. I know it doesn't make
sense to you right now,
but you have to trust me.
In his room, the pictures of me.
The room was empty.
This is all in your mind.
There has to be
something in the kernel.
Diane...
Maybe the code is self-replicating,
- or there's a memory link.
- Diane...
Diane,
I can't move.
Jake, it's in here.
The answer is in here
somewhere and I will find it.
There's no more time.
- You got to reboot.
- No, we can't do that.
- Why not?
- Because the nanites are fully integrated
into your system.
They are part of you.
If I shut them down,
it will kill you.
Maybe just for a second.
No. No. We don't know that.
There's got to be another way.
Jake,
no, I will not be the one to kill you.
Please...
Okay. Okay, okay,
I'm setting up the command structure.
The link is set.
She can't save you, Jake.
Okay. You are okay.
You are okay. Are you ready?
Okay.
Jake!
One, two, three.
Come on, Jake.
One, two...
One... come on!
Two, three.
Come on! Jake!
Jake!
Jake?
I'm sorry.
Jake!
Hey!
Who are you?
What?
I'm just kidding.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No, no!
Diane, Diane,
I'm the best man.
Please?
I have a toast to give.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Okay.
Give me a second.
Director Beckett, Hi. It's Diane.
You're asking about Jake?
Yeah, have you heard from him?
Yeah, I spoke to him
this morning and he's fine.
I overreacted as usual.
All right.
We'll see you Monday.
Okay, bye.
Congratulations.
Thanks, buddy.
- Here we go.
- Oh.
I know you've all been looking
forward to this, so, uh,
here goes.
Life
is, uh,
hard, you know?
Brace yourself, folks.
Thank you.
Go on, Jake.
Okay.
Jenny,
Kevin may need more
professional help than most,
but he's a terrific guy,
and he loves you more than anything.
And, Kevin,
science may never
discover how it happened,
but you won Jenny's heart;
and, to me, that's
the real miracle here.
We're lucky if we're
able to find someone
who's always there for us,
who stands by us
no matter what.
Makes life easier.
So,
to my friends,
to our good friends,
Kevin and Jenny.
Thanks, buddy.
Hey. Your toast was really beautiful.
It seems like you got over your fear.
Yeah. Yeah, I guess
it was all in my head.
So,
where's Alex?
Oh. I think he found
somebody more his type.
I don't get it.
Alex is gay; he's a friend.
I just hate coming
to these things alone.
But I thought I heard...
I thought that Joe...
So you're not...?
Oh, no, no. No.
The closest Alex
gets to me is a facial.
Oh.
Well...
So, uh, I guess I'm, I'm dateless.
Yeah.
Um...
I think we're supposed to dance now.
Yeah.
Sarah,
I think I need to dance with my date.
Would you like to dance?
Aren't you supposed to...?
Yes.
I forgot to tell you something.
What?
You look beautiful.
Grazi.

Jake Foley was an ordinary guy
until a freak accident transformed him
into the world's first
computer-enhanced man.
Millions of microscopic
computers interface
with his biochemistry and
make him stronger and faster,
able to see and hear
farther than normal men.
They give him the power to
control technology with his brain.
Jake Foley - America's
secret weapon.
He takes on missions
no ordinary agent can perform.
He is the ultimate
human upgrade.
Stay sharp, Jake, could be anyone.
Sector one all clear.
This is two. Nothing here
displacing a ticket counter.
Copy that, two.
Possible multiple targets
in three's location.
Moving west to the food court.
Give us the word. Check that.
It's nothing.
Got a guy with a suitcase.
Fits the profile.
Mid to late 30s. Possible ex-military.
Give us the word. Possible
confirmation at Foley's 20.
He's opening his bag...
False alarm.
That's a negative. Standing by.
Kyle, Kyle! Trash can, north exit.
I'm on the suspect. Guy is white,
baseball cap, khakis.
He's heading for the escalators.
Roger that, two is moving.
Three's rolling.
He's down! Do not move!
Do not move!
What do we have?
That canister was full of ricin gas.
Coagulant fuse.
It would have liquefied
and released in five minutes.
Hundreds could have died.
Tokyo all over again.
He doesn't fit the profile. He's
just a kid. Why would he do that?
It's because it's all he knows.
Both our intel
and the viciousness of the attack
point to one conclusion:
Today's incident was the work
of Ethan Fulton's militia.
Fulton is an extremely
dangerous and driven man.
His wife Ann
was FBI.
She was gunned down in a botched raid
on Henry Travis' compound
near Bozeman in 1994.
Fulton blames the government
for her death,
not without some merit.
Who is this guy?
Chief Director Skerritt. Lou's boss.
- Lou has a boss?
- Shhh.
We've been targeting
Fulton's militia for years.
They are responsible for six
domestic terrorist attacks
including the near miss on
the Supreme Court in April.
Now, as you can see,
we haven't been able
to I.D. many of them.
So today's capture
is a very important step
forward in our investigation.
Now I would like to acknowledge
Agent Foley's part in that capture.
- Lou's boss just complimented me.
- I heard.
We have an I.D. on the assailant?
No, sir. He's being
interrogated right now.
You keep me posted.
Excellent work, all of you.
Good-bye, sir. It was
very nice to meet...
Okay, you heard him.
Fulton is aware
the noose is tightening
so watch your backs.
Hey!
Yo, chill!
Is that any way to treat
your kid brother?!
Oh Jerry? Oh...
I could have killed you.
Yeah, yeah, right, dude, right.
What are you doing here?
Came to see you, of course...
also, our nation's great capitol.
I hear downtown's strip club-alicious.
That's me. Jake Foley,
I'm in Tech Support.
Security Clearance: Low.
Very low.
Then one day, it all changed.
Life just got real interesting.
- Okay, Ensenada.
- How could I forget?
Booze cruise, bikini twins, discotheque.
No. Federales, a pumped stomach
and a switchblade fight.
No, it was a butterfly knife.
You dug it. Admit it.
All right, I will admit that you talked
us out of it. I'll give you that.
Um, hello. Can we get some
Servicio, Por Fa-please?
Oh, god.
So, why aren't you in school?
I needed a break. You know,
I've been working pretty hard.
I got classes every
Tuesday and Thursday.
Uh-huh.
Plus I wanted to hang with my big bro.
Mom and dad know you're here?
Jake, I keep mom and dad on a strictly
need-to-know basis.
What happened there?
Um, it's a
work-related accident.
Oh, what your motherboard cut?
- What up?
- You guys ready to order?
Uh, beer. Start with a pitcher of draft.
Can I see your I.D.?
Oh, he's 26. He just looks young.
Your I.D.
Oh, me. Oh, um,
because when we left,
you were going to drive, so I...
I left my wallet at the house.
I'm sorry. I can't serve you then.
This is my brother. He'll vouch for me.
Oh, right. Yeah, he'll have a red bull.
Make that two, please. Thank you.
You call yourself a big brother?
That's right.
I'll let you make it up to me.
What do you say we shock on our
red bulls and hit the strip clubs?
Jerry, I can't. I have to be
at work tomorrow.
Hey, if I can make it through
a rigorous day of study
with a massive hangover,
I think you could, too.
I'll do you a favor; if I can get
off work tomorrow night,
we'll go out and do
something fun, okay?
Yeah, I can't wait.
Anyway, don't worry about me.
You won't even know
I'm here. I promise.
Hmm.
Sorry.
Whoa!
Yo, Jake, wake up.
Jerry,
I'm trying to sleep.
It's kinda important.
Oh, what is it?
- Promise you won't get all pissed?
- Oh, just say it.
I need a fire extinguisher...
like pronto.
What?
Okay, you're done.
Your vitals look good.
Have you had any
lightheadedness or nausea since
we had to, you know,
reboot the nanites?
Since you saved my life?
Yeah.
No, I'm fine.
Okay. Any recent glitches,
complications, any abnormalities?
My little brother's in town.
He's a bit of all three.
- I didn't even know you had a brother.
- Mm-hmm. Hmm.
He's checking out Georgetown
or burning down my apartment,
whichever comes first.
How old is he?
Nineteen... going on six.
Hmm. A little immature.
No, no, he's a lot immature.
When I was his age, I was
working two part-time jobs
while was taking eighteen
credits at Georgetown.
Did you have to walk six miles in
the snow every day to get there, too?
Funny. I'm serious. I don't get it.
He's a smart kid. He could go far.
He always screws it up.
He has no focus, you know?
Who does at 19?
Oh, well, except for you
and Bill Gates.
- Huh, duty calls.
- Yeah.
Stop by any time.
I have good news and bad news.
The young man who put
ricin gas in the subway
is Caleb Fulton,
Ethan Fulton's only son.
Now, Ethan blames the government
for the loss of his wife
and our capturing his son
will not sit well.
On the other hand, Caleb
grew up inside of the militia.
He knows it inside and out.
And next to capturing his father,
he's our best hope
in shutting them down.
- What's he saying?
- Nothing.
Our best interrogators
are working on him.
So let's get back to work.
Follow every lead,
every scrap of intel.
Um, do you think maybe
I could talk to him?
It's just we might have a connection
'cause I was the one that captured him,
and we're closer in age than you guys.
Not that you're old or anything.
You look great. It's just, uh...
I think he might relate to me better,
possibly.
Quit while you're ahead, Jake.
See what you can do.
Well, your pistons are shot,
your gas filter's rusted
and it looks like you might have
a crack in your engine block.
But I could have it ready Monday.
Say hello to the wife for me.
Thanks, Jimmy. I owe you.
They knew what we were doing
before half our men did.
Now, can you explain
to me how I let my son
walk right into an NSA sting?
You didn't crypt the final transmission
to our people in Virginia.
Ethan...
There is no excuse that
is going to free my son.
Sir.
There's been some concern
among the men about Caleb.
That they might possibly
force him into talking.
Caleb won't talk.
And neither will he.
Caleb.
I'm Jake.
You're pretty quick.
Thought I was chasing Emmitt Smith
down there in that subway yesterday.
I guess that's appropriate
since you were
all-league running back in high school.
Was it 24 touchdowns you
scored your senior year?
That's impressive.
I can barely score five when I'm
playing Madden on my PlayStation.
You should try the rookie
setting, it's easier.
Yeah, I will. I'll try that.
Thank you.
So you read my file?
Yeah. Yeah, I did.
But this isn't your file.
Have you ever seen what ricin
gas does to the human body?
That little boy right there
is three years old.
That's his sister.
That's her mom.
The gas fills your lungs.
It feels like fire, but really
it's more like drowning
because your lungs literally burst.
That's why there's so much blood.
You almost did that to a lot of
innocent people yesterday.
But you didn't.
It's not too late,
you can change your life.
I can help.
How?
Tell us where your father is.
I'd rather die than betray my father.
He did not say that.
What do you look like?
So, what are you going to do tonight?
You should totally come over.
Jerry...
Hey, you got to try everything once.
And I'm telling you,
you haven't lived life
until you've tasted
my pasta a la Jerry.
Now get your buns over
here and I'll prove it.
She so wants me.
You met a girl already?
No. You did. Sarah.
She as hot as she sounds?
My Sarah? Were you talking to her?
No, relax, bro, it's fine.
I know we talked forever.
She's coming over to see you.
- Whoa, whoa, tonight?
- Yeah, man.
I'm hooking you up.
What's the deal with you two?
Nothing. We're friends.
Oh, I get it. She's a bowser.
No.
Fat?
She is beautiful and
she's intelligent, okay?
- So...?
- So...
it's complicated.
And it's none of your business.
Hey, whatever you say, man.
Do you mind keeping
it down for a while?
I'm gonna squeeze in a nap
before smackdown. Thanks.
Any progress?
- We know he's NSA.
- We knew that yesterday.
We know he's local. We believe
he works out of Fort Mead.
I want the name and
location of the man
who captured my son.
And then I want him standing right here
in front of me
so I can kill him myself.
Yes, sir.
Pasta a la Jerry coming your way!
Sarah. Sarah.
- No worries.
- Don't eat the food.
- I'm serious.
- I'll mop that up later.
Dinner... is served.
So, uh, what's in this?
Uh, pasta, vietnamese hot sauce
and selected seasonings.
It's a dorm room classic.
Dig in, Wedgie.
Wedgie?
One of Jake's many nicknames.
So what do you call him?
Oh, no, I'm far too mature
to embarrass Jerry like that.
Right, Humper?
I don't even want to know.
We've just begun picking up some
encrypted chatter from Fulton's militia.
First time since the ricin incident.
That's right. We believe there's
something going down tonight.
How long before we can decode it?
It's an algorithmic encryption.
It's gonna take a while.
Get every one of your code
breakers on this thing immediately.
You've got to hear this one.
Jake shows up to
Cheryl Rhodes' sweet 16
dressed like Gene Simmons.
I mean, full KISS makeup,
leather codpiece...
They told me it was a costume party.
Look at the time.
No, no, no. Hey, hey
I've got one more.
No, no, Jerry, you really don't.
Hey, this may be Sarah's only
opportunity to know the real you.
Right?
It's Christmas, and I was, like, seven.
And all I'd asked for that year
was this kick-ass red huffy bike.
Apparently, "Santa" got the message
because Christmas morning, there it was
along with a list of rules from my dad.
Number one being you
always lock the bike.
- Wha...?
- So Christmas Day,
I'm riding that sucker all
over town like it's a Ferrari.
I pop into the store for a soda
and when I come out, it's gone.
Jake finds me two hours
later crying my eyes out.
We go home and Jake tells my dad
he borrowed my bike
and forgot to lock it up.
Yeah, he got grounded for three weeks
just to keep his little
brother out of trouble.
That is so sweet.
I'll be right back.
Cool story, huh?
None of that ever happened.
It's no biggie, she'll never know.
That's not the point, Jerry.
Hey, I'm helping you seal the deal.
You can thank me later.
Where are you going?
I'm clearing the runway, man.
You can't land a plane when your little
brother's sleeping on the airstrip.
I'm not to trying to land a plane.
Hey, that's your own issue.
Can I borrow some cash?
I'm a little light.
You know, from dinner.
Yeah, sure. Take whatever
you need from my wallet.
Where's Jerry?
Uh, he had to go.
You, uh...
pizza?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I thought you might be cold.
Your father never told you
about this part, did he?
I'm prepared to die for my cause.
Did your daddy teach you that?
Caleb, how many people have to die
before you realize your
mother's never coming back?
I take it you're not married.
Got any kids?
That's none of your business.
No matter, I can tell.
In your world, your job comes first.
In ours, it's family,
it's loyalty to your blood.
I feel sorry for you.
The feeling is mutual, Caleb.
Hey, can I help you?
Uh, scotch, neat, two napkins.
You got your I.D., kid?
I never leave home without it.
What kind of scotch?
Uh, the brown kinds.
Right.
Hey.
Hey.
You a secret agent or something?
Huh?
I snuck a peek at your NSA badge.
You naughty little girl, you.
- There you go.
- So, are you? An agent?
I could tell you,
but then I'd have to...
Kill me?
I was going to say "sleep with you,"
but, uh, if that's your thing...
- start a tab.
- You got it.
You got to understand,
we were best friends.
We went through the Academy
together. We had nicknames.
So what happened?
I looked into his scared dark eyes...
and I asked him one more time.
I said, "Are you a double agent?"
He took a deep breath...
his hand slowly slipping from mine,
and he muttered,
"Si, Senor... Si."
Then I let go...
and watched him plummet to his death.
Wow.
Right. So where'd this all happen?
Where did this happen?
Can't tell you that, sir.
It's classified.
Yeah, stupid, it's classified.
All right, the drinks
are on Agent Foley.
Yeah!
Fo-ley! Fo-ley!
Anything on Foley?
NSA has him listed as a tech support,
but our people in payroll
can't confirm this.
There's no record of him on file.
I don't give a damn where he's listed.
I want to know where he is.
We're working on it, sir.
- You check DMV records?
- Came up clear.
You can't take a piss in this country
without someone knowing.
You're trying to tell me we can't find
this government piece of trash?
Wait a minute, we got something.
Foley just used his credit card
in the last ten minutes.
- Where?
- Georgetowne Station.
It's a bar on 4th and K street.
You get on him, now.
But having no idea where
little kids come from,
I just put it on my Christmas list:
One little sister -
and I was so pissed
when I didn't get one.
I just wanted someone to take care of,
you know, like you and Jerry.
Oh, Jerry never needed
anybody to take care of him.
Oh, come on, I heard the bike story.
Sarah, uh... that never happened.
What?
He made it up, but that's Jerry -
he's just trying to help.
To help what?
Uh, well
I-I guess he thought
that-that you and...
and-and me m-
uh, I guess he just thought that
maybe you'd like me better if...
Well, he was wrong.
Yeah.
I don't need any more reasons
to like you, Jake.
You got your standard military grip
that's been around since the 1800s.
I prefer a more modern approach
made popular by rappers
and drug dealers.
It's, uh, "let's kick back" and...
just plain cooler looking.
Come on, people, you with me?
We found him.
Oh, Jake, you have a little, um...
What? Here?
Uh, I-I'll get it.
I should...
Answer the phone?
Yeah.
Hello? Uh. Hello?
- Uh, Jake?
- Jerry?
Yeah. I'm in big trouble.
Okay. This one's for you,
and this one's for you.
Let's just say I understand the part
where you take my car without asking
and accidentally bump
into a police car.
Let's just say that
I understand the part
where you threaten to call
your friend, Mayor Williams,
if they don't let you go. But why
would you give them my I.D.
and pretend to be me?
First of all, you have a
much better driving record,
and second, you're NSA -
they should've let you walk out
of professional courtesy.
What is wrong with you?
Don't go all parental on me. We got
a couple of tickets - it's no big.
Yes, yes, it is big, Jerry,
and the amazing thing is,
you don't see it.
You know what?
This has been fun,
really, a lot of fun,
but I think it's time
you go back to school.
I can't.
Why?
Because I dropped out.
What?
I don't need school.
Oh, my god.
I know this guy, Randy Marshank,
he's making 10k a month with a web cam
and a girls' volleyball team.
Jerry, even for you,
that is the dumbest thing
I have ever heard in my life.
Why, because I want to do
something with my life?
No, you don't want to do
something with your life.
You want to avoid doing
anything with your life.
- I have a plan.
- No, you don't. No, you don't.
You have a scam.
That's all you ever have.
You know what? I don't need this.
I don't need some nerd
who sits at a computer all day
telling me how to live my life -
I don't need you.
Good. Good.
'Cause I don't need
some irresponsible child
hanging around wrecking my apartment
and stealing my stuff!
- Lou?
- Yes?
What's wrong?
We've decrypted the chatter
from Fulton's militia.
It's about his next target.
What is it?
Jake Foley.
Foley.
Oh, whoa, oh, hey, man,
you were in the bar, right?
And you brought your friend.
Oh, is-is this about that girl?
I didn't touch her, man.
She said she was single.
Respect, bro - I'm all about respect.
Whoa! Whoa, take it easy.
It's... we should all
go back to the bar,
and I'm buying. Sorry about...
Let's go.
What?
Jake, it's Lou. You need
to come in right away.
They took my son away from me, Foley.
And you need to know...
That that was a mistake.
What? I don't know what
you're talking about.
I don't know you.
Why are you doing this to me?
This is the NSA nowadays?
We're going to win this war.
I'm talking about my family, Jake,
and how you're going
to pay for what you did.
I'm... not Jake.
I thought he was a little young.
He was at the bar spouting off.
- He said he was Jake Foley?
- Yeah, he had Jake Foley's I.D.
And credit card.
Jerry Foley. Jake's brother.
Oh, god. But at the bar...
Yes, at the bar he was 'spouting off'.
I remember.
I'm sorry, sir.
I failed you and your son.
You didn't fail.
In fact,
you might have saved my son's life.
What's going on?
We've had a communication
from a man claiming to be...
Ethan Fulton.
All right.
- Was it about me, or something?
- Yes.
- Where is he?
- We don't know.
What do the communications say?
That they've got your brother.
They want an exchange.
Him for Fulton's son.
And if we refuse?
What did it say?
If we don't release
Caleb in one hour...
they're going to kill Jerry.
Okay. Okay.
So, so, we have his son.
So, we figure out a way to do this.
Where do they want to do it?
- Jake...
- I get it.
- We have to get them to come to us.
- Jake,
the National Security Agency
doesn't negotiate with terrorists.
What?
No, we have to...
This isn't a negotiation.
- We're just figuring out a way to...
- I realize this is difficult.
They have my brother!
And we are doing everything we can.
But we do not negotiate.
It only makes it more likely
that someone else's brother
or sister or father
will be taken in the future.
We have to help him.
I'm very sorry.
- Lou, we got to figure this out.
- Jake, I need a little time.
No, ee don't have a little time -
we don't have any time.
This is insane.
I'm not going to let them...
He needed me and
I wasn't there for him.
And now they're going... Please, please.
Jake, did you hear Skerritt said?
We don't negotiate with terrorists.
There's nothing I can do. I...
I can't go down to Caleb's
cell and let him out.
Do you understand?
I can't do that.
Jake, you have ten minutes,
and they're right behind you.
Does your brother love you?
We're about to find out how much.
He's got...
25 minutes.
Put this on.
- Why? What's going on?
- Don't ask me any questions.
I'm getting you out of here.
Good. Let's go.
Aw, come on.
This way. Go.
Go. Up the stairs.
Okay, try it now.
Isn't technology grand? Thanks.
What the...?
Call your father.
- I told you...
- Caleb, he has my brother.
He wants you in exchange. Now
I figure we've got about two minutes
before the NSA figures out that
you're gone and I took you.
So if you ever want to see your
dad again, you call him. Now!
Louise,
what you know about
Caleb Fulton escaping
from a supposedly secure lockdown?
I'm aware of the situation,
and I'm on it.
Well, you better be.
You made it.
I was pretty scared.
You're my son.
You never, ever be afraid of anyone.
Not them, understand me?
Yes, sir.
He came alone and unarmed.
You're a man of your word.
Where's my brother?
I'm a man of my word, too.
Oh, Jerry.
It's okay.
Come on, it's gonna be okay.
You moving on?
It's how we survive.
- What about Caleb?
- What about him?
He's just a kid.
Why don't you let him have a life?
Because his life is here
with his family - with me.
And I wouldn't overstay
my welcome if I were you.
Come on.
Watch your back. There are friendlies
in the building! Standing by.
This is the NSA.
Throw down your weapons
and come out with your hands up!
You are surrounded.
Hold your ground.
Weapons down! Let me see your hands!
Hands!
Clear!
Okay, we're clear.
You okay?
Yeah.
No. Caleb...
You okay, sir?
Well, we had a terrific
success last night.
We shut down the militia,
arrested Fulton and his men.
However...
I have people very high up
I have to answer to.
I realize that.
Do you?
And what am I supposed to tell them
about our policy
of never negotiating with terrorists?
Tell them we didn't.
God almighty, Beckett,
you got bigger ones than I do.
Thank you, sir.
You ready?
I think so.
You going to have any
trouble re-enrolling?
You mean the work studies
chick in admissions?
- Tight.
- Nice.
So now, uh, about the parental units?
Yeah, you came to check
out Georgetown...
because you insisted
on me having a plan...
once you get out of junior college.
Sweet. Thanks for everything.
Yeah.
Okay, enough of the Gilmore
Girls. Let's roll.
- So, can I ask you one question?
- Sure.
What exactly do you do at the NSA?
I could tell you, but then
I'd have to kill you.
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
Jake Foley was an ordinary guy
until a freak accident transformed him
into the world's first
computer-enhanced man.
Millions of microscopic
computers interface
with his biochemistry and
make him stronger and faster,
able to see and hear
farther than normal men.
They give him the power to control
technology with his brain.
Jake Foley - America's secret weapon.
He takes on missions no
ordinary agent can perform.
He is the ultimate
human upgrade.
I gave you a chance to do
this the easy way.
Now, sooner or later, you're going
to tell me where that bomb is.
I'm going to count to three. Three.
Oh, you think you're tough?
Oh, you think you're a bad-ass?
Think again, pal.
Remind me never to piss you off.
It's time.
- Already?
- Yep.
Ooh!
This is a very serious matter
concerning the personal safety
of all 46,000 NSA employees.
The workplace is not in home. There
are rules that govern your behavior...
Will you just take one and pass 'em?
Oh, but I collect seminar pamphlets.
Each of us is entitled to a safe
and harmonious work environment.
But it is our - all of
our-responsibility
to maintain that balance.
Now, if somebody is doing
something offensive,
you have to speak up.
Be sure to say no. If you smile
or act unsure of yourself...
Would you feel harassed
if I took this seat?
Oh, maybe a little.
We'd all like to be able
to joke about it,
pretend it isn't a big deal.
Please don't sue.
I doubt it's actionable.
I'm sure you all have places
that you would rather be,
but if you just give me your undivided
attention for half an hour,
I will try to make this
as painless as possible.
So, if you could please open your
pamphlets to section number one:
"Unwanted advances and
lascivious eye contact."
Now, as cited in Title VII,
the relevant section
civil rights act of 1964,
a "person" is defined as
one or more individuals...
Yeah, I'll be going for
the E6 field promotion.
Yeah, they can say California is theirs
all they want. It still belongs to us.
Satellite remote. No, honey.
The big gray one controls the tivo...
Yo quiero mas informaciones
acerca de la siete quinze
de diciembre. Me gusta mucho...
We've got a problem.
Echelon monitor over Europe's
detected a scrambled call.
- What are they using?
- I've never seen it before.
Some sort of crystal
logarithmic device.
- Initialize decryption.
- It's already running.
Record and process. We'll see if the
boys in crypto can make anything of it.
- Right away.
- What's the source?
A mobile phone.
Triangulating now...
Vienna, Austria.
# in untranslated Polish
I don't know...
I'm sort of in the
middle of something.
I'm talking about 5 million.
- Hmmm.
- 5 million.
Is that American dollars?
Of course, American.
Give me day to tie up loose ends.
I'll be in DC on Monday.
Mr. Lowenstein...
I'm afraid I have unfortunate news.
I'm not going to be able to do this
as thoroughly as I had hoped.
I'm deeply sorry...
about the rug.
That's me. Jake Foley,
I'm in Tech Support.
Security Clearance: Low.
Very low.
Then one day, it all changed.
Life just got real interesting.
So, want to catch a bite after work?
- That sounds great.
- Okay.
- Well, I'm off to catch the bad guys.
- Hmm, have fun.
Good weekend?
Yeah! Very good. You?
Oh, pretty uneventful.
I laid around on my couch,
watched a little football.
Well, a lot.
I don't know. I think I may
have watched all the football.
What-what'd you do?
Oh, I went out to Wolftrap
to see Alicia Keys.
- With who?
- Uh, well,
you haven't met Steve Clemens?
No, no, I haven't had the pleasure.
Oh, he's in cryptology. He's...
Eccentric? A little bizarre?
I was going to say, uh, "nice."
Hey, does he wear one of
those colanders on his head
to keep out the brainwave scanners?
I'm not making this stuff up.
Those code-breaker guys are weird.
Yeah, and do they exhibit
classic antisocial behavior
like never leaving their
couch all weekend?
Hey, Sarah, we're finally talking.
I know, just when I was
starting to develop
a relationship with your voice mail.
Yeah, you guys are
getting pretty close.
We are. He knows just when to beep.
Uh, a little predictable, though.
Yeah, I'm sorry. Things have been
crazy around here, but, uh...
I've wanted to talk to you.
Me, too. Uh...
look, I-I know it's short notice,
but my boss gave me his tickets
to the Saint Sebastian's
Fund-Raiser tomorrow night.
I know it sounds kinda lame...
No, no, you kidding?
I love the Saint...
Sebastian's fund-raiser.
- So, I'll meet you there, then?
- Okay, sure.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.
C'mon, I have a job
for you, Mr. Roboto.
"Mr. Roboto?" You're
dating yourself, Kyle.
Sounds like a dying hippo.
It's actually a next-generation
encryption program.
So far, it's stymied any attempt
to unscramble with logic software.
It's kind of like a lock that changes
shape whenever you put a key in it.
We were hoping you could
interface with it, and...
- Ask it to be a little less difficult?
- Yeah, something like that.
I'll give it a shot.
Sorry, it's still gibberish.
No, it's not.
It's Polish.
Oh.
His name is Vasily Koronkiewicz.
According to the telephone
conversations we've intercepted,
it's highly probable
he's in the DC area.
This man is an efficient,
dangerous mercenary
who specializes in abduction.
He's been high on Interpol's
radar since the disappearance
of the Belgian consul last April.
Human trafficking. Nice guy.
Capturing Vasily is
our highest priority.
I want his 20 by the end of the day.
So? We gonna go shake
down some snitches?
Jake, please. I haven't
even finished my coffee.
- Transcription from linguistics.
- Thank you.
"Narodowy?"
There's no translation for this word.
Oh, uh, here. Let me.
Uh, National Bank of Poland.
There's a Branch on Florida Ave.
Hey, can you tap into
their security cameras?
I can if he tells me to.
Run Vasily's photo through
facial ID for the past 12 hours.
All right. What are we missing?
What haven't we thought of?
Well...
there's always LaFortunata.
What's LaFortunata?
Why don't you show him?
Speak only in short, terse phrases.
Under no circumstance are
you to engage, got it?
What is this? The dungeon
where you keep the Pig Boy?
Oh, oh, let me call you right back,
all right? I got some company.
I know. I know.
Will wonders ever start?
Okay. Okay. Keep your chin up.
- Seymour.
- Mr. Duarte!
Do I hear that clarion call?
Oh, my country needs me?
Just put that stuff anywhere.
Vasily Koronkiewicz.
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
He's a heavy, heavy hitter.
I was hoping some of your people
might know who put him up to bat.
Okay. Uh, yeah. Have a seat.
Let me make a few
hundred phone calls.
Uh, yeah, we're on kind
of a tight schedule,
Sy. Whatever you can do?
Thanks for your help.
Yeah, no need to front-load
the gratitude, boys.
I haven't worked my miracles yet.
Eastern European crime factions,
Asian triads, the guy on the corner
with a pop gun under his jacket.
Economic globalization has turned
it into one neat, big web,
but the spider feels
every little ripple.
Uh-huh.
And... you're the spider?
I could write a book...
if I hadn't signed a foot of paper
promising that I wouldn't.
Between you and me,
I started anyway.
You must be Jake.
- Yeah. How'd you know?
- Seymour LaFortunata.
Interpersonal liaising, as I'm sure
Mr. Duarte has informed you.
Apprehension of the unicorn
killer, Ted Kaczynski,
Mufari Allis-Khan...
ringing any bells?
You helped capture all those guys?
No, of course not,
don't be ridiculous.
Wink-wink, nudge-nudge.
Kid's a little green, isn't he?
Little slow on the old uptake.
- You read my mind.
- You see? You see that?
You see that, Jake?
That, that is my magic.
I read people.
Gonna have to cut this short.
Facial ID's got a hit.
- Vasily was at the bank.
- Wow.
It was nice to meet you.
Really nice to...
You, too. You, too. Go get 'em.
Maybe this could refresh your memory.
I'm sorry. I can't help you.
Tell me, Mr. Harcourt,
would you prefer we wait until this
guy's already committed a crime?
You have reason to believe
that the immediate seizure
of the financial records in
question is necessary to prevent
the death of or serious bodily
injury to a human being?
We wouldn't be here otherwise.
Then pursuant to chapter 21a,
subchapter 1, Part A
of the unlawful acts
section 2000-Double-A,
you should have had no trouble
obtaining a subpoena duces tecum.
Do you have a subpoena for me?
I left it in the car.
You understand these are
extraordinary circumstances.
In the time it would take
for us to petition a judge,
very bad things could happen.
And none of us want that on our heads.
In the absence of a subpoena,
you can have the IRS issue
an administrative summons vis-a-vis
the bank secrecy act.
How about you just
blink once for yes?
Harcourt?
What?
If I were to open up
a checking account here,
what would I get,
like a free toaster?
We're done here.
Yes, we are.
Thanks for all your help.
I knew I brought you
along for a reason.
Vasily received a wire transfer
for $500,000 in cash.
Thanks to Jake, we have
a routing number.
So, we should be able to
track it back to the source,
figure out who hired him.
Well, why would a pro like Vasily risk
being paid in cash on American soil?
He needs the money
to complete the job.
I want to know who's
footing the bill.
I want to know what he's buying.
And most importantly,
- I want to know where he is.
- I'm on the routing number. I'm on it now.
I've got your number.
One routing number, seven hours,
153 dead ends.
I feel like my eyes are bleeding.
I mean, actually bleeding.
Are my eyes bleeding?
Uh...
no.
All systems normal.
No complications with the nanites.
Aren't you even going to
do your penlight thing?
You don't need an exam, Jake.
You gust need to unplug.
Do something without computers
before you get permanent rasterburn.
Why don't you...
see a movie?
A movie? You mean one of those big,
bright things you sit and
stare at for two hours?
Oh, sorry. Bad suggestion.
Just do something with a human.
You want to come over
and play Boggle?
What? You're human.
Yeah. Um, I-I would like to, but I...
- Steve. Hi.
- Hey, Hughes.
Um, uh, Steve Clemens,
- this is Jake Foley. Jake...
- Hi.
How you doing, Foley?
Hi. Never better.
So, I'm thinking dinner at Maggie's.
What do you say?
- Mmm.
- White pizza.
- Freakishly white, still tangy.
- Mmm.
Uh, why don't you come, too, Foley?
I'll buy the first pitcher.
Oh, you know, I had
dinner last night.
And, uh, the whole novelty's
kind of worn thin.
- So, you sure?
- Yeah.
Yeah, you guys go ahead.
Like I was telling Diane,
I just feel like crashing out.
Or working all night.
Hmm. Where are you hiding,
Mr. Vasily?
Oh, hey. Looks like I've got a match.
We've already got four teams
out chasing possibles.
Let's take this one.
Corner of 6th and F.
Do you even really need to sleep?
I mean, with those nanites and all.
No, Kyle. I just plug myself
into an electrical outlet
for a couple of minutes,
and I'm good to go for the day.
Hey, I'm just asking.
I have no idea what
it's like to have...
Kyle, I'm still human.
Okay. I understand.
So when you jog, do you
hear that slo-mo
running sound from the
six million dollar man?
The one that goes - do-do-do-do-do...
You're dating yourself again,
you know that.
Hello.
What do you think
he's got in the bag?
$500,000 worth of unmarked
nonsequential bills.
This is Agent Duarte.
We have target confirmation
on Sixth and F. Requesting backup.
He looks anxious.
Any sign of the mark?
No.
Damn.
Hey!
You all right?
- Yeah.
- Oh, god.
Oh.
Emergency, we have an agent down.
Repeat - we have an agent down.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Miss, hold on a second!
- I'm Dr. Diane Hughes.
- I got to get to the med lab right away.
- I need to check your bag.
Here, keep it.
The nanites accelerated
hemostasis tenfold.
Fiberglass are already proliferated
in position for a collagen synthesis.
- That's amazing.
- So, what's it feel like?
Feels like a freak on parade.
It's not the circus, people.
You got a lot of guts, Jake.
But if it weren't for the nanites, I'd
be stuffing them back inside of you.
What's the situation?
Give me the bullet.
Mainly superficial damage.
Slashed through the primary derma.
Penetration was minimal.
No organs were punctured.
An inch deeper, though.
Can he get back to work?
If it's nothing too strenuous. He should
be as good as new in a day or two.
Glad to hear you're okay.
Thanks.
Sat Ops in 15.
- We need to run a full diagnostic.
- I did.
Careful. Platelets? BP?
- He checks out.
- I'm fine, Diane.
Jake, I am so sorry that I was not
here. It will never happen again.
Late night?
- Kind of, yeah.
- You and Steve?
Yeah.
We caught a midnight show of the
"Long Hot Summer" after dinner.
Huh.
What?
Nothing.
What?
Well, it's just, you guys are
moving kind of fast, aren't you?
Excuse me.
Lab. Steve, hi.
Maybe not.
You've got the accent way wrong.
Yeah. Orson Welles
was a lot more mumbly.
Guess I'm fine then.
It's not like I was
stabbed or anything.
More like a slash, really.
Kind of like a big paper cut.
No. The nose, the nose, the whole
fake... except for the knife.
prosthesis thing. No. It was so fake.
It was better than Nicole Kidman's
schnoze in 'The Hours'.
Are you kidding? No, no, no.
I'm not a Lee Remick man.
I'm a Joanne Woodward man.
Hi. Yeah.
Sweep teams covered
a four-block radius,
but no further sign of Vasily.
We lost him.
Yeah. I sure put the fear
of god into him.
You should have seen the blood
stain I left on his sleeve.
- That won't come out, you know.
- Any progress on the wire transfer?
We traced it to a
corporation in Warsaw,
but it's a shell within a shell. Jake?
Oh, yeah. I got it right here.
Okay, pay dirt on
Corporation Number 156.
Coming up as publicly held,
but the only name generated
is "Wladimir Sticj".
- Who's that?
- I don't know.
But I'm going to find out.
LaFortunata?
Yeah. LaFortunata.
Brave man.
It's hard work.
Novel approach, Jake.
I still hit the wall. Yeah.
Yeah, well, I will knock it down
for you, my friend, all right?
I admire your tenacity, Jake,
but, I... oh, but, hey, hey,
I would stick as close to home base
as you could if I were you. Last
guy who got his hands on Vasily -
Karl Devereaux at MI-5 - ooh.
Ooh. What? What about him?
Vasily cut off his hands, and sent
them to Karl's wife for Christmas...
along with a nice fruit cake.
Yeah. I'll keep that in mind.
Hey, you're-you're
the field agent, right?
Despite your lack of
a shoulder holster.
What's-what's up with that?
Anyway, Jake...
never mind. You know what?
None of my business. It's fine.
I'll find out soon enough
about your guy.
Keep your chin up.
Jake. Okay.
Hey, Sarah.
Jake, you made it.
Hey, you look... What's the word?
Fantabulous.
Thanks. So do you.
Uh...
So, um, what do you want to do first?
Well, uh, let's do the gambling thing?
I've got a little money
burning a hole in my...
Diane?
Hey. Hi.
- Hi.
- What a surprise.
Yeah. Hi, Sarah.
- Hi.
- Uh, this is Steve Clemens.
- He's my, um...
- He works with us.
And apparently has an uncanny
radar for where the fun is.
Steve went to St. Sebastian's.
So, um, he was, uh,
all city guard and-and-and
high honors, right?
I told you that in strict confidence.
I'm using everything I can
to get her to like me.
Well...
So...
Anybody for basketball?
Yeah, yeah. Let's go.
Steve's really good.
Thanks. I mean, yeah.
What? Do I have something in my teeth?
Oh, no, no, no. I just...
it's a little embarrassing. I...
when I first met you, I-I thought
there was, uh, something
between you and Jake.
Really? No. No.
We work together,
and you know how those things are.
Those worlds - they don't mix.
They collide.
Right. Business and...
Sorry. Sorry.
But, uh...
but you and Steve work together?
Yeah, but he's in
a different division.
And you and Jake are
in the same division.
Exactly.
So, uh, I.T. is in the same division
as, uh, medical research?
No. No, no.
That wouldn't make any sense.
Uh, did I say 'division'?
'Cause really in the NSA,
it's more like,
um, like-like 'wings'.
No, thanks.
Nice going.
Thanks.
Ooh, look what Steve won.
So you and Diane - pretty sudden.
I know. She's great, isn't she?
So, you guys are friends.
Has she said anything about me?
No, not really.
It's a winner!
Thanks. Steve,
you can't keep winning everything.
I don't have enough room on my bed.
You can make some room.
Hey, uh, test your strength, fellows?
- No, thanks.
- Come on. Sure. Sure.
Come on, Clemens.
I'm buying.
Here you go.
All right.
Now, there's a strong man.
Nice.
Okay.
Here goes nothing.
Oh!
Foley! You're a beast.
Uh... winner.
Are you all right?
Cheater.
Woo! Churros.
I'll treasure it always.
Um, so what do you want to do next?
Uh...
Is something wrong?
Uh, Sarah,
I have to go. I'll call you.
What?
Hey, Clemens, have you done
any field work?
- Just basic training. Why?
- You know what a code nine is?
- Yeah.
- Call it in right now. Code word, Vasily.
What's happ...?
No. No! What are you doing?
- I'm saving your ass.
- He's already down, man!
Yeah.
Okay.
Open it up.
Why don't you guys go get
yourselves some coffee?
I didn't think to bring you any.
It's a diuretic.
Yeah, that would be problematic
given the sparse modern
confines of your new home.
I've been in worse.
I'm glad you approve.
Since twice you've assaulted an agent
of the United States Government,
I doubt you'll be seeing
the outside world again
for another ten to
fifteen years minimum.
Oh, now that's got to bother you.
Must be really tough not having
any people around to kidnap, huh?
Foreign diplomats,
British Intelligence...
Are you going to torture me,
or are you just going
to talk me to death?
No. We don't torture
prisoners in this country,
no matter how much we might like to.
That's a shame.
I find pain to be
the most effective way
of getting what you want.
Is that why you tried
to hurt my friend, hmm?
To get something from him?
I cannot believe you tried
to take him down alone.
Thank god Steve had your back.
Yeah.
This is healing nicely.
You know he's getting a commendation.
We're going to go out
and celebrate tonight.
Even talk of making him
an active field agent.
Diane, they don't just make
anybody agents, okay?
Don't be jealous, Jake.
There's plenty of room
here for two heroes.
Yeah, and only one of us is
paying alimony. Go figure.
What are you talking about?
Steve's divorced.
Yes, I know. He told me.
They married right out of college,
and she ended up loving her job
a little... more than she loved him.
Did... he didn't tell you this.
Have you been checking up on him?
Oh, please. Come on,
like I don't have enough to do?
I'm analyzing money trails.
I'm pursuing...
dangerous... mercenaries,
uh... come on.
Okay, okay, maybe I took a little
peek into his personnel file.
Oh, I cannot believe you.
Me? Diane, me? Diane,
why is a crypto guy carrying
a gun to a carnival?
Oh, Jake, half the people
in this building carry guns.
Half the people
in this country carry guns.
- There's something wrong with him.
- Oh, no, there is something wrong with you.
You've lost the ability
to relate on a personal level.
Oh... that is not true.
Yes, it is. You don't even
leave your house all weekend.
You go out,
and you're completely awkward.
I saw how you were with Sarah.
Oh, god... I ran out on her.
I totally forgot.
Do you see?
What is going on?
All right, we kissed,
like, a week ago, okay,
and-and... I don't know.
Well, isn't that a good thing?
I mean, you-you've liked
this girl... forever.
Diane,
I have millions of microscopic
robots running around inside of me.
Please tell me what the next step in this
relationship is, because I have no clue.
I mean, the best I can hope for
is that I don't lie to her,
because she can never
know the real me.
Nobody can ever know the real me.
Nobody except you.
Jake...
I'm here for you.
I'm not going anywhere...
but you got to stop cutting
yourself off from everybody else.
There is life outside this building.
- Anything?
- Nothing.
I'll keep at it, but I don't
think he'll give up his bosses.
- No good for the rep.
- Lafortunata called.
- He says he wants to talk.
- Yeah, and talk, and talk...
- I'm on it.
- I'll go with you.
Bless you.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Sarah, I-I am so sorry
about last night.
- It was work. This thing came up...
- Jake stop.
I get it.
You do?
Look, we kissed...
and it was nice.
Yeah, yes, it was.
I don't think either of us expected
there would be something there,
but there was. I felt it,
and I thought you felt it, too...
but you don't have to keep
coming up with these stories
to cover the fact that you're...
hesitant.
I'm not. I'm not. It's...
I don't want to wreck this.
I don't either.
But I need to know
how you feel, Jake.
I need you to be completely
honest with me.
You want me to be honest?
Totally.
Vladimir Sticj.
Your boy Jake put me onto him.
Not of any prominence,
really. He, uh...
tended bar at the beer
hall putsch in 1923,
spent the last 40 years
buried in a less
than ornate grave at
the Bierkel cemetery.
- I don't follow.
- Just wait for it.
Now, technically, this guy
is the sole shareholder
of the same corporation
that hired Vasily.
One of my fraternity brothers -
Boola-Boola - has a-a cousin
who opened a transistor
factory in Gdansk.
Now, he says that this
"corporation" is actually
a front for local mafia,
mostly, you know,
ex-KBG and whatnot.
Well, why would a local syndicate
send a mercenary to DC?
Well, because... because
they're-they're obsessed
with cutting edge technology -
most recently, nano-technology.
Vasily was commissioned to retrieve
a human subject to get them
in the nanotech game.
Now, if you guys know anybody,
you know, who fits that bill,
now, I would recommend
getting him well-protected -
they got deep, deep pockets.
It is not going to end
with this Vasily character.
Welcome. You're welcome, guys.
You guys... stop by any time.
Wow, uh...
that-that's unbelievable.
I... I don't know what to say.
There's nothing you can say.
I mean, really -
you can't tell this to anyone ever.
So, let me get this straight, um...
you're a secret agent at the NSA,
and... there-there are
these tiny robots...
Computers, really.
Microscopic computers.
They're self-replicating,
feed off...
Uh... yeah, t-tiny robots.
And-and they got inside you, and, uh,
now you have these, um...
superhuman abilities.
Okay.
I-I know this is a lot to take in,
but I felt like...
well, I just... I-I needed
to be one hundred percent...
I just asked you to be
honest with me, Jake.
Sarah...
You know what?
It's been a blast.
At least I didn't lie...
Do you have to be so dramatic?!
Get in!
You got lucky.
Vasily was hired to retrieve
a human subject
linked to the nano-technology.
- I don't get it.
- Jake, he's here for you.
What?
That doesn't make any sense.
He could've had me... twice.
Why didn't he take me?
Let's ask him.
Okay, wake up, Sleeping Beauty.
I got some more questions for you.
Hey. You got a dead
prisoner in there -
you want to tell me
what the hell happened?
- That's impossible.
- No. No. No!
We searched him completely. No
unauthorized personnel has been in there.
Then what authorized person has?
The last visitor was...
Steve Clemens.
What?
Diane's new boyfriend. He's a dirty
agent. He's working with Vasily.
Once we caught him...
Steve had no choice.
He couldn't let him talk.
He cut out the middleman.
He's going to finish the job,
and give them exactly what they want:
An expert on nano-technology: Diane.
So... you're not going to
tell me where we're going?
Uh, I told you... it's a surprise.
Okay.
Bring up the feeds for all metro
intersection cameras and toll booths.
Steve Clemens took the black duffel
out of the evidence locker.
Diane isn't answering
her cell or home phone.
Oh, no, she's with him. Cross-check
with Steve Clemen's license plate.
- What's the number?
- A DC plate, 4BMH359.
Come on!
- Where?
- Key Bridge into Virginia.
- When?
- About fifteen minutes ago.
Re-task all available
eyes in the sky.
Start tracking sequences.
I want a pinpoint.
Oh, my god.
Steve.
- Hope you like boats.
- I do.
A friend of mine chartered one.
Turns out he's not going to use it,
so I thought we could take
a little pleasure cruise.
- And I'll cook you dinner.
- Ooh.
- How's that sound?
- I think it sounds very romantic.
Oh, I'm glad you think so.
What's the status on the vehicle.
Clemens' vehicle is stationary.
Two miles east on 60,
royal avenue exit.
Copy that.
Jake, nothing's going
to happen to Diane.
You pissed?
Very.
Good.
Fan out, fan formation.
No one fires unless fired upon.
Oh, Steve. This is so fantastic.
Let's go, let's go!
- Jake!
- You okay?
- What are you doing here?!
- Where is he?!
I've got the champagne.
- Foley.
- It's okay.
- You shouldn't be here.
- Steve!
Why don't you tell her why
you really want her, huh?
What's going on?
Sorry, Diane. I really like you,
but you can't imagine
how much they're paying me.
Jake, turn the boat around.
Oh, that's not going to happen.
Jake!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Lousy. Ugly. Lying.
Bastard.
Lone.
Only. Lonely.
Solo. Sadly,
badly and madly.
That's all I got.
It's your turn.
Okay, uh, I have, um...
"tush."
That's it?
Oh, uh, and, um...
"tush-y."
- I guess you win.
- Hmm.
Again.
Whoo-hoo. Oh, god,
I feel like such an idiot.
Hey, could have happened to anybody.
Yeah. Not just anyone
allows themselves
to get wined and dined
and sold into white
scientist slavery.
Well, that just, uh,
proves how special you are.
Yeah. I guess I should have listened
to you. You were just trying to save me
from the world's most pathetic breakup.
Well, second most pathetic.
I win that one, actually.
I guess sometimes people,
they don't want to see
the truth even...
when it's sitting
right in front of them.
Yeah.
Do you think you can take me?
Oh. Well,
I-I don't know if I can
compete with your... brain.
Oh, yeah?
You weren't even trying.
Well, apparently the only word
you don't know is "mercy."
I didn't see that one.
Seriously, Diane,
y-you have an amazing mind.
Yeah.
Why can't I find a guy who's
just after my body, huh?
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
Jake Foley was an ordinary guy
until a freak accident
transformed him
into the world's first
computer-enhanced man.
Millions of microscopic computers
interface with his biochemistry
and make him stronger and faster,
able to see and hear
farther than normal men.
They give him the power to control
technology with his brain.
Jake Foley - America's secret weapon.
He takes on missions no
ordinary agent can perform.
He is the ultimate
human upgrade.
Just, um... get me
the undersecretary,
okay?
You do that, and nobody
else gets hurt.
That's not going to happen
until you start giving
me some hostages.
No, don't play diplomat with me.
I've been working in this
office for over ten years,
and I am tired of being lied to
by the government.
There's another door to that office.
Looks like it was patched over.
If I can get into the office
- next to it, I can take him out.
- You're not going to take anyone out.
The snipers will be in
place in three minutes.
We could all be dead
in three minutes.
I'm warning you -
I'm not feeling very patient today.
Get me the undersecretary,
or somebody's going to lose a life.
- Kyle!
- No!
Sal, that's not gonna happen
until you start showing
some good faith.
Okay, you give me what I need...
I'll give you what you need.
Month after month
I bled for this lying,
double-dealing government.
He did it.
You're welcome.
Did I or did I not give
you a specific order?
- Yeah, but...
- You think you're something special
- because you've got powers?
- No...
Well, I've got news
for you - you're not.
You wait for backup and you follow
orders just like everyone else.
It's called discipline,
and it saves lives.
- That's all I was trying to do.
- Oh, yeah?
Did you know the wall
would break that easy?
That his assault rifle
didn't have a hair trigger?
That he didn't have explosives
hidden on his person?
Jake, you've been enhanced.
You can do some pretty
spectacular things,
but that's not what this
job is really all about,
and if you don't learn that,
somebody's going to get hurt.
I didn't go through
channels, General.
I figured you'd want
to know immediately,
and I didn't want to waste any time.
You did the right thing.
Open the vault.
Sir,
I have been sole custodian
to the Hades 13 tactical
mini nukes for six months.
Not once on my watch
has there been a defeat,
a glitch or any discernible
violation of security.
Just show me what's wrong
- What are you doing?
- Just watch the countdown, sir.
Disengage that explosive.
I'm requesting that The General
observe the countdown.
And I'm giving you a direct order.
Disengage that explosive.
Now!
What just happened?
It's a decoy, sir.
Somebody stole one of my nukes?
Jake and his nanites may be
the center of this unit,
but he's got a serious
discipline problem.
Are we talking about a phase
or something more permanent?
Oh, permanent enough if he gets
himself or someone else killed.
Apparently, there's
no "we" in nanites.
Well, I'm not surprised.
A few months of NSA
field work is no cure
for a childhood full
of James Bond movies.
Well, I think we better find a cure.
There's someone you need to meet.
General Freewald.
Tank Buster. It's been awhile.
I served with The General
in the first gulf war.
Your boss was the best
helicopter driver in the force.
And absolutely lethal
with a rocket launcher.
Agent Kyle Duarte.
You trust this man?
Hoo-ah.
Agent Duarte.
Well, Tank Buster,
the day has finally come -
I'm actually glad
you traded in your Blackhawk
for a desk at the NSA.
- Well, that makes me nervous.
- And well it should.
Fort McClelland serves
as a repository
for our arsenal of Hades 13
tactical mini nukes.
- What happened?
- Stolen.
One of your nukes is missing?
Fort McClelland is 100% secure.
Nothing happens there
I don't know about.
That leaves only one explanation -
One of the members of the wolf pack
stationed at my base
has turned traitor.
Traitor? In the wolf pack?
Aren't they the most
elite in special ops?
Well, that's the official story.
What they are is a semi-autonomous
black ops squad.
They do things the U.S. Government
really isn't supposed to.
We give them a job,
the wolf pack gets it done.
No questions asked.
And a member of this
team has a Hades 13.
Have you alerted CID?
CID is a joke.
So is JAG.
I give them a call,
they send me two nitwits in khakis
to stumble over every
obstacle on the base.
This job needs to be done covertly.
Any indication that we know
the weapon is missing,
and our traitor vanishes.
I know how they think.
I used to be a member
of the wolf pack.
Before I turned sane.
You want this thing done,
you'll have to do it my way.
I'll mobilize every asset I have
around the world to find this device,
but I will need to put
someone on the inside.
I'm already with you.
The wolf pack is
expecting a new recruit.
I've delayed his arrival.
That leaves an opening for your man.
There's only one catch.
These men operate at the
highest standard of strength,
endurance and agility.
Your agent is going
to have to pass muster
or he will be made.
I believe I've got your man.
You did say he could
use some discipline.
- Jake.
- Yeah.
- Jake.
- Hmm?
No.
The body is a temple - even
a nanite-enhanced one.
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.
Am I acting like I'm too good to
follow orders like everyone else?
It's true? I'm becoming THAT guy?
No, but...
I'm still glad that Kyle
read you the riot act.
Why, because you like
to see me humiliated?
Because I'd like to
see you alive, Jake.
You know, I bet he told Lou...
"Jake's grandstanding."
"Jake's chewing gum. Jake..."
Has a new mission.
Get up to speed.
So you want me to join the Wolf Pack.
Great mission. Really.
There's just one small thing,
and it's not that I think
I'm special or anything,
it's just that, well... Uh...
I don't really do well
with teams or packs.
Especially in uniform. Jocks,
frat guys, marching bands.
They eat people like
me for breakfast.
Are you done?
You're going to learn
to become a soldier.
I have someone standing
by to train you.
Yeah? Who's the Yoda-like miracle worker
that's going to make that happen?
Well, Timmy's not going to be
playing the violin any time soon.
That is the most pathetic
field kill I have ever seen.
You will never leave your weapon
in, on, or around the enemy.
- Do we understand each other?!
- Yes, ma'am.
For the last time, Jake,
the correct answer is 'hoo-ah'.
'Hoo-ah' means 'yes',
'thank you', 'please',
'pass the ammo', 'praise the Lord'.
Do you understand?
When in doubt - hoo-ah!
Hoo-ah!
You don't have to yell
it all the time, okay?
Now if anybody asks you
about your past missions,
or people you've served with,
you go no further than 'hoo-ah'.
These men aren't going to trust you
until they've tested you, Jake.
And even then you're not going to sit
around talking about your feelings.
And don't worry - I'm not going
to open up to these psychopaths.
They're not psychopaths, Jake.
These men are highly competent,
connected and skilled soldiers.
They don't have to salute.
They don't have to wear
their hair or uniforms regulation.
And they don't have a problem
operating in a morally gray area.
So how come you never
joined the wolf pack?
They don't take women.
The NSA does.
So are you ready to do this?
Sure.
I mean, hoo-ah.
- Hit me.
- What?
Hit me!
Hope you don't have
any plans for tonight.
Let's go, soldier, move it,
move it, move it.
Let's pick up the pace.
We've got some time to keep here.
Come on, soldier, you're
moving like pond water!
Move it! Move it!
Sergeant first class
Mitchell Gant, wolf pack.
Do you need to see my papers, or...?
- Uh, sergeant, we're not the wolf...
- Hoo-ah!
they are.
Company, clear the square!
Hey, man. How ya doing?
Captain Hartman?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, at ease.
You must be Gant. Nice knowing you.
- Got some papers for me?
- Uh, yes, sir.
Cool.
Why in the name of hell
are you giving me up as
your commanding officer?
You ever salute me in the open again
and I will exsanguinate you,
understood?
- Yes, sir.
- Don't you "sir" me.
You want me dead?
Is that what you want, huh?
Get up and answer me.
The pack is your mother, and
the pack is your father, kid.
From now on, everything that you need
you will get from us.
That is, of course, if you can
manage to cut it here
for more than 30 seconds.
Think you can do that?
Think you got what it takes?
Hoo-ah.
Drills are up. Move out!
Welcome to hell.
I want every dealer and informant
in the world arms market
tracked down and interrogated.
If Hades 13 is in play, I want
to know who, where and how.
You are also to put
all of our field agents
monitoring the sale of nuclear
equipment on high alert.
If anyone buys a radiac meter
anywhere in the world,
I want someone with NSA creds
standing by to ask why.
- Understood?
- Yes, ma'am.
Good. You know the drill.
In god we trust,
all others we monitor.
I have a special mission for you.
Let's go! Keep up!
Move your ass! Move it!
Hoo-ah.
Get him over that wall.
Sixty-two!
Sixty-three!
Sixty-four!
Sixty-five!
Sixty-six!
Sixty-seven, sixty-eight
sixty-nine, seventy
seventy-one, seventy-two
seventy-three, seventy-four
Well, I guess you could
describe it as summer camp...
ten-mile runs...
I've never been this
tired in my entire life.
Hey, the nanites aren't going
to burn out or anything, are they?
No.
No, they're-they're doing fine.
Oh, good.
What about you? Are you scared?
I don't know what I am.
These guys are crazy, but...
I think they may be
starting to respect me.
Oh, crap. I'm late, I got
to get back to the barracks.
Bye
Gant!
That's some fine work out
there today, my friend.
You're the man, Gant.
Sierra Hotel, all the way.
Hey.
Thanks.
USDA choice,
hard ass.
You're going to do us proud.
Thanks, man.
You impressed every man in this unit.
Thank you.
You're welcome. Good night.
Good night.
Stop the car.
You're lucky you weren't on an
actual mission, Agent Foley.
If the wolf pack thought you were
slowing them down in battle,
they'd just pop a slug
in your kneecap.
Well, I guess lucky in your world
mean being tortured all night
by a bunch of jingoistic mesomorphs.
Sir.
I trust Louise Beckett with my life.
I hope that trust
hasn't been misplaced.
You and me both.
Louise Beckett is not
someone you let down
without serious consequence.
You know how she got
the name Tank Buster?
Let me guess - she blew up
a bunch of tanks in the gulf.
Tank was a man.
Piloted a Black Hawk
in your boss' outfit
and had no end of crap to give her
about being black, being female,
being attractive.
You name it, he had a slur.
And Beckett put up with everything,
until tank bugged out
on a hostile encounter
a little faster than he should have.
Left Beckett all alone
to weather the fire storm.
But one night,
tank went to the CO,
begged to be taken off
the flight rotation,
confessed he acted
in a cowardly fashion
and spent the rest of
the war behind a desk.
And he never said a mean
thing about anybody
ever again.
What'd she do to him?
Nobody knows.
That's why I'm warning you.
Don't give Louise Beckett
a reason to dislike you.
Someone here to see you.
So, you're undercover, too.
None of our intelligence assets
can place Hades 13
in the arms market.
Our informants in the terrorist
underground have nothing,
so the most plausible
scenario right now...
Is that the weapon's
still on the base.
- You have to find it.
- How?
The wolf pack carry field laptops.
Traitor may have used his to uplink
with someone about the bomb.
Now, you have to go through
the wolf pack's duffel,
interface with their gear
and copy down their
communications logs.
Okay,
am I going to do that before or after
the monkeys fly out of my butt?
Kyle...
don't send me back
in with those guys.
If the Hades 13 in detonated,
a lot of people are going to die.
Jake,
there are no half
measures on this one.
You have to find the discipline
and commitment to take
this all the way.
- Is that an order?
- Yes.
All right.
I need some nerve gas and a funnel.
I don't know, but I've been told...
I don't know, but I've been told...
Wolf pack men don't sing no songs!
Wolf pack men don't sing no songs!
Oh, the little crap hound!
Wolf pack men is where it hurts!
Wolf pack men is where it hurts!
Shut your hole and...
That the worst your little sorority
bitches could come up with?
What kind of mongolian
goat manure in your skull
made you think I'd follow a woman
like you into battle, huh?
Get my eat tool.
Who in the name of sweet god almighty
put all these holes
around my barracks?
Someone could trip and
fall into one of these.
That's just plain unacceptable.
Listen to me, you little ass clown.
You listen to me good. I want
each and every one of these holes
off my base by sun up,
or you will suffer the kind of pain
you only ever hear tell of.
Hoo-ah.
Hoo-ah.
Lights out in five minutes!
What?
Nothing.
You clocked your CO,
and instead of beating
the snot out of you,
- he made you dig holes?
- Yeah.
It's supposed to impress upon me
the fact that I'm so retarded,
I don't even merit
army-grade punishment.
As you can see,
the shame is unbearable.
Yeah.
Well, that's the last of them.
I'll upload the data to Lou
from the main complex.
- Mm-hmm.
- This was clever, Jake.
But that nerve gas is going
to wear off real soon.
There's still a traitor in this unit,
and these laptops may not be
enough to snuff him out.
Well, being clever had
nothing to do with it.
This is just Phase One.
You sure you know what you're doing?
Kyle, now is not the time
to second-guess me.
You asked me to become one of
these men, that's what I'm doing.
What exactly do you have in mind?
That's on a need-to-know basis.
Six hours ago, you were telling
me not to send you back here.
Now you're General Patton?
You gave me a specific order
to take this all the way.
I'm taking it all the way.
Sergeant, stop the vehicle.
No five-mile run today, gentlemen?
Gant...
you magnificent bastard!
You see what you pulled off?
How the hell did you do that?
Let the man have his sec he's
got the huevos to pull that,
god only knows what
he'll do in the field!
Looks like we found ourselves
a tactical mastermind!
Hoo-ah!
You took your beating like a man,
and you gave as good as you got.
Hey, everyone gets tested, Gant.
No exceptions. Nothing personal,
huh? Nothing personal.
What do you say, Lawrence?
What do you say?
You think it's time we give young
Mitchell here an initiation?
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah?
- Initiation? Initiation?
- Initiation!
Hang 'em up! Hang 'em up!
Initiation! Initiation!
Initiation!
Down the hatch.
Hey, hey! Can't you knobs
take a direct order?
I said shaken, not stirred!
Hey, now that we know
each other so well,
how about we make this
cub part of the pack?
Hoo-ah!
The real initiation, Gant.
Come on, get this off! Let's go!
Ho!
Oh, yeah!
Come on, Gant!
Carve it in! Don't pass out!
Carve it up! Open your eyes, Gant!
Take it, Gant. Take it! Look at it!
Don't close your eyes!
Take the pain! Look at him bleed!
Come on!
Take the pain! Take it!
Take it like a man!
Come on! Come on!
Right! Arms in!
Hoo-ah!
We ran through crypto and data
analysis on those logs you sent us.
I think we might've
found our traitor.
We know that a member of
the wolf pack leased a jet.
It's waiting for him somewhere in the
Florida Keys. We don't know where yet.
He also bought equipment
to handle nuclear material.
Now our guess is
he's moving Hades 13
out of the country.
Well, is he selling the bomb,
taking it to a buyer?
We don't know yet. Make the arrest.
Take the soldier straight
to General Freewald.
Interrogate him and
get those answers.
How's Jake?
Easy!
I'm not sure.
What do you mean?
He's one of them now.
We need to get him out of
this as soon as possible.
Oh, he'll get out. As soon as
I have the traitor and the bomb.
Right.
Oh, yeah.
So... now that Gant's been branded,
I'd like to propose a toast.
To absent friends.
- To absent friends.
- Aubrey?
Hey, Gant...
we don't mention that
name around here.
No, Lawrence.
Gant might as well
know why he's here.
The pack was asked to deal with an
afghan warlord in the Chaiko Valley.
This puke had some bio-weapons,
left behind by the Soviets.
It was simple -
snatch and grab the bio-weapon.
Next thing you know,
we're in a hard firefight
through the local village.
Aubrey took some shrapnel.
General Freewald sends orders
not to jeopardize the bio-weapon.
To forget...
Aubrey and get out of there.
Two days later,
al-Jazeera shows a video
of Aubrey being torn limb
from limb in the streets.
One of the Wolf Pack.
We let him die.
So... a toast...
Sergeant Ken Aubrey,
General Wesley Freewald.
- Oh, forget that, man.
- No, no.
Let's give acknowledgment to the man
who made us dishonor
ourselves and our brother.
May he meet with all the
advancement and commendation
that he deserves... in hell.
- Hoo-ah.
- Hoo-ah.
Hoo-ah. Hoo-ah.
Hey, hey, I didn't know
she was married, I swear.
Shut up and keep your
hands behind your back.
We're going to walk out
the back door real quiet,
and you're going to tell
General Freewald
who you're working for and
where you hid the Hades 13.
We understand each other?
Well, you got to be on the pipe
if you think I'm going to do that.
Oh, okay.
Well, let's see what
the wolf pack does to you
when they find out
that you're a traitor.
- Take me to the General.
- That's what I thought.
You acquitted yourself quite well,
Agent Duarte,
but this is an internal matter now.
A question of honor.
This man and I need to
settle our affairs in private.
With all due respect, General,
you called the NSA,
and I'm not about to leave you alone
with a member of an elite
assassination unit.
A unit I used to head, Agent Duarte.
But have it your way.
Just remember
what happens in Fort McClellan
stays in Fort McClellan.
Are we clear on that?
- As a bell.
- Good.
You know,
in antiquity, when a field commander
found a traitor in his midst,
he had the authority to shoot
the lying sack of crap on site.
Well, you gave the
wolf pack the order
to leave Ken Aubrey in Afghanistan.
Does that mean I can shoot
you on site... sir?
I did what was necessary.
You were carrying
a lethal bio-weapon.
It's safe return was top priority.
That was the mission.
Our man was top priority.
Aubrey was still alive.
And you would've killed
every man, woman and child
in that village to him back.
Aubrey did his duty.
What the hell do you know about duty?
You were one of us.
The wolf pack never left a man behind
until you gave that order.
All right
You have something
that belongs to me.
Now, the way I see it,
you have two choices -
hand it over or die.
Fine.
The Hades 13 is...
All right...
the keys to the cuffs.
Please.
Hoo-ah!
It was a hairy fur ball that night.
Bodies flailing everywhere.
Didn't know which way was up.
Couldn't fight your way out.
All we could do was give in.
And give in, we did.
- Unbelievable.
- Son...
you never visited
a Panamanian whorehouse?
I can neither confirm nor deny
that I have ever been to Panama.
Hoo-ah!
Heads up!
Can I help you, officer?
He's not an officer.
His name is Agent Duarte,
and he's a spook for the NSA.
I take it this man has
knowledge of our operation.
Yeah, Freewald called him in to
find out who took the Hades 13.
You're all in on it... aren't you?
- What's he talking about?
- Quiet, Gant.
What about the General?
Well, my guess is they won't
find his body till dawn.
Agent Duarte apprehended
me in the club.
I decided to turn the situation
to our advantage,
find out how much he
and the General knew.
Oh, and frankly,
not sorry about Freewald.
Understood.
All right, mount up.
We're pushing our timetable.
Hall, Burns, Stern -
you're on weapons detail.
I want the entire pack
ready to bug out in 20.
We move the Hades 13 out
of the country tonight.
Get up!
Just make sure this piece of garbage
tells us everything he knows.
Now, who else knows?!
I told you.
I report to Freewald.
I'm working alone.
I don't believe him.
I concur.
What do you have to say
for yourself, Gant?
You are the first leader of a wolf
pack to leave a man behind.
- Aw...
- You followed a bad order
and you know it,
but I didn't judge you
when I volunteered to serve
under your command.
Now, one of your officers
has murdered a General.
An agent of our government
is bleeding on this floor,
beaten by your hand,
not by any standard of human
and military decency.
I should put a bullet in your skull
no matter what the consequence,
but instead I am standing here
NOT JUDGING!
So if you want to be
responsible for the death
of another one of your brothers,
have the courage of your
convictions and pull that trigger,
otherwise I respectfully
suggest you judge me
by my deeds, sir.
All right, have it your way, Gant.
You kill the man.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- You got to finish him off.
- Shut up and give me the cuffs now.
Now!
What are you doing?
Tape!
This man deserves a slow...
and painful death.
You think he merits
a soldier's death,
you give it to him yourself.
Gear up!
Moving out!
Woo-ah!
If the wolf packs can sneak that
weapon out to the Florida Keys,
I want an ambush waiting with all
the fire power we can muster.
So you find me that damn airstrip.
Director Beckett,
it's coming from Agent
Duarte's field phone.
Get a fix on Kyle's
location. Find Jake.
We need to get into that base.
Scramble covert team, have
a chopper meet me at the helipad,
and tell them to stow
an extra set of body armor.
- I'm sorry, Director, are you...?
- I'm handling this myself.
Gant.
This team's been operating under
a cloud of shame for too long.
You want the opportunity to be
part of the wolf packs' redemption?
I consider it an honor.
Hades 13 tactical mini nukes.
Ever seen one of these go off?
No.
But that's all about to change.
We have a jet waiting
for us in the Florida Keys.
So we're headed for Afghanistan?
We've got connections in every town
and village and near to Karachi.
In less than three days,
infiltrate Afghanistan
through the Paki border
and deliver the Hades 13
to the Chaiko Valley.
There's a helicopter standing by.
Get us out of there
before she goes off.
and takes out the Chaiko Valley.
Yeah. Every one of those animals -
it's a joy to torture
my boy Aubrey to death.
Hey, general, welcome to the party.
As you requested.
No one searches the General's traspo.
Stern, load up the weapon.
Here's we go.
Um... I say we stay off
the main roads.
Just get to the...
Lock and load!
Put your weapons down
and surrender now!
I knew it.
That weapon is not leaving this base.
I disagree. Hall?
All right. All right. Stand down.
Nice throw. You want to cut
his heart out for me?
It's my pleasure.
Down! Everybody down!
Drop your weapons and hit the deck!
Freeze!
On your face! Get down!
Put your hands where I can see them!
- Kyle?
- He's all right, he's alive.
- Yeah!
- Mannick!
Attend to this man.
Lou, thank you.
Hi.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
You did what you had to.
It was necessary.
We're proud of you.
I know it was tough.
Yeah, was tough.
- But also way too easy.
- I know.
We all got that inside, Jake.
It's a matter of how we use it.
Lou told me to, uh...
smuggle in some beer.
Love that woman.
Here. Take it.
Thanks.
- You going to be all right?
- Yeah.
I heal fast, I guess.
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
- How could you?
- Let me call you back.
It's a little something
called chain of command.
It's a little something
called betrayal.
I had orders and I followed them.
I promised her she'd be safe.
I gave her my word!
That wasn't your promise to give.
Are you having me arrested?
Deputy Director Beckett, Agent Foley,
we have orders to bring
you both upstairs.
What do you mean he's
not on that flight?
I have the manifest right here.
Can I help you?
- What is going on?
- It's an emergency Board of Inquiry.
- It's like a trial.
- Only worse.
Okay, I don't understand.
What did we do?
Director Beckett,
Agents Duarte, Foley,
Dr. Hughes.
This Emergency Board of Inquiry
has been convened to decide
the future of your Special Ops unit.
Jim, we should have received notice.
This board is under no obligation
to notify you of anything.
Lou,
considering what's happened
in the last few days,
there is enormous pressure
to justify Agent Foley's behavior.
Don't worry. This isn't a witch hunt.
We just want the truth.
It is now 8:47.
I'm calling this hearing to order.
Please sit.
Let the record show
that six years ago, NSA began working
on project Free Target
exploring the use of nanites -
molecular-sized computers
to enhance our agents'
field behavior.
Several months ago,
a lab accident resulted
in the premature introduction...
of millions of these nanites
into a human subject,
Jake Foley, at the time,
a computer technician.
At Director Beckett's request,
Foley was promoted
to full agent status
and a Special Unit was formed
with him at its core.
Now, since that time, this unit,
at best, has produced uneven results.
Technology isn't the issue here.
Agent Foley's enhanced
physical powers and endurance,
along with his ability to interface
with electronic devices and computers,
are all very impressive.
Impressive, yes, however,
this program was designed
for a trained professional,
used to following orders,
something Mr. Foley clearly is not.
Recently, and most egregiously,
he disobeyed a direct order
to execute an enemy of the state
and aided that same individual
in an attempt to assassinate
a foreign official.
If I may ask,
what are the possible
outcomes of this...
"Inquiry"?
Either the board is satisfied
with your explanations,
or we terminate the program.
This is not a trial
in the formal sense.
What does that mean?
- We don't get a lawyer.
- Lou,
could you please identify
yourself for the record,
and tell us what happened
regarding this operation
starting November 17.
Deputy Director Louise Beckett, NSA.
On the 17th of this month,
there was a break-in
at the Densmore Research Facility
in Alexandria, Virginia.
And the intruder stole three
vials of a controlled substance.
Thank you.
Why did you tell him about...?
Agent Foley,
if there's something you
need to say to the board,
will you please address us directly?
Okay, well, I was just wondering...
Give your name and position,
please, for the record.
Uh, Agent Jake Foley.
The things you experienced firsthand.
From the top, if you don't mind.
From the top. Okay.
Uh,
well, I guess it all started
when I got an urgent phone call
from my immediate superior,
Agent Duarte.
Hey, I got here as fast as I could.
What do you need?
You.
You know this girl I've been seeing,
Megan Reilly?
Yeah.
Her sister's in town for a few days.
Uh, no. No. No.
Wait, wait, wait, Jake.
She's really cute.
Uh-huh.
Look, all you have to do is hang out
with her one, maybe two hours, tops.
No, forget it.
I have a hard enough time talking
to girls I actually know. Kyle...
Well,
on the other hand, anything I can do
to help a friend out of a jam.
Yeah.
So, you really like
those daiquiris?
Jake, Jake.
Janet. Janet.
How do you go out there every day
not knowing if you're
ever coming back?
Well, I pretty much know
that I am coming back,
'cause, like I said,
I'm a computer tech,
so we come back every morning,
except weekends.
Right. Right.
Hush, hush. On the QT.
I'm sorry, but I don't know
why I thought you could
talk about it.
Uh, I can talk about it.
I just did.
And you told me nothing.
You are very good.
You know,
I just feel so grateful
knowing that there are
men out there like you
doing what you do.
It's getting kind of late.
It's only 9:30.
Yeah? Feels a lot later.
C'mere you.
Ow.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Yep, I think just maybe
a chipped tooth.
Want to go back to your place?
Agent Foley.
You told me to start from the top.
Yes, Agent Foley,
regarding the mission.
Right. Right.
Anyway, after heretofore
described events at the bar,
Agent Duarte got a call from Sat Ops
instructing us to come in
immediately...
Three vials of nitrous
varcon were stolen
from the Densmore lab
at exactly 1930 hours.
This is the deadliest V series
nerve agent on the planet.
What is it, Jake?
I just didn't think the U.S.
manufactured biological weapons.
We don't.
Varcon has never
officially been produced
or tested in this country,
never will be.
Understood?
Can the security guard
I.D. the intruder?
No, all he remembers
is a cinder-block wall
flying at him at 30 miles an hour.
We do have audio feed
from the break-in.
- That's not a lot to go on.
- No, it isn't.
When we find this individual,
executive action obtains.
Executive action?
- Shoot to kill.
- We can do that?
When the order comes
from the President we can.
We've just received echelon chatter
indicating a potential
buyer in Santa Costa.
- The rebels?
- That's what I want you to find out.
Can I come?
Director Beckett,
Agent Foley's unique
skills didn't seem
to have any specific
application to this mission,
so would you mind
explaining to the board
why you would risk our
agents and our investment
in nanotechnology by sending him in?
Jake isn't an appliance.
He's a member of our
intelligence community
being trained for
advanced field work.
He goes on missions. And by the way,
any other agent would have
ended up dead on that assignment.
Would any other agent
have compromised
the mission to such an extent?
All right, all right.
Ease off, Mr. Jennings.
Dr. Hughes.
Me? Yes, I'm Dr. Hughes.
Um...
I'm the scientist in charge
of the nanotechnology program.
I took over from Dr. Gage.
He was, well, he was shot. He died.
Dr. Hughes,
part of your job is
preparing Agent Foley
- for his work in the field.
- Yes.
Please, tell the board of
inquiry about your examination
of Agent Foley before
he left for Santa Costa.
Um...
Well, I was giving him some shots.
I, uh...
heard about your hot date.
Ow. What did Kyle tell you?
Nothing, just that she
came on a little strong.
I've had people shooting
at me and been less afraid.
Well,
I guess you could consider
it a compliment
in a scary, nutty,
- clinically-obsessive kind of way.
- Yeah.
Hey, Diane, listen,
I need to ask you a question.
It's kind of a
doctor-patient thing.
Sure.
Okay... uh,
you know, it's funny,
I never had a female doctor before.
Do you have a rash?
What? No.
Oh, I...
um, so, then what's this about?
Uh... well,
okay, let's just say
that the girl last night
wasn't totally insane, okay?
And that I wanted
to take her back to my place.
Is it safe?
You mean... um...
Well, yeah, I mean,
if you use a condom.
No, yeah. I-I know that. I just...
I mean with the nanites
and everything?
Well, based on research,
I can say with some
degree of certainty
that the possibility
of transference/infection,
is statistically low enough
to be considered
virtually nonexistent.
Uh-huh.
So, you're telling me
I can have sex, right?
I should do some tests
just to make sure.
I'm not thirsty, thanks.
Uh...
Oh.
Uh, so I should, uh...
Yeah. The bathroom is just
over there, and...
there's a lock, yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, Diane.
- Hi.
- What's Jake up to?
Um...
My name is agent Kyle Duarte.
I'm Agent Foley's Direct Superior
and the person most
involved in his training.
Do you believe that Agent Foley
was a benefit to your
operation in Santa Costa?
Yes.
Please, tell us about the operation.
We arrived in Santa Costa at 0800
and made contact
with our local agents.
Two hours later,
we had the alleged buyer
and seller in our sights -
a male latino and
a blond caucasian female
they were meeting at an apartment
in the market district.
Notice how the travel brochures
never mention monsoons?
What's up with that?
Oh, hey, hold on.
Yeah, it's the buyer and the seller.
Oye, Jorge, estan en camino.
Whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey! Muevate!
- Excuse me!
- Ifuera de aqui, oye!
Excuse me.
Sorry, sorry.
Don't move!
No se mueve, por favor.
We found all three vials
in the apartment.
Muy bien. Esta todo que puedes llevar.
(Very well, you can take them away now.)
Tenemos el varcon.
(We have the Varcon.)
Dos sospechosos han sido arrestados.
(The suspects have been arrested.)
Si, si. Los tres frascos.
(Yes, the three vials.)
- They say anything?
- Oh, you know, the usual -
"We're innocent,
we don't know how it got here."
We can have a talk
with them later on.
Why don't you go back to the hotel?
I'll call you when I know something.
Are you sure? You sure
there's nothing I can do?
'Cause I know I was jet-lagged before,
but I'm pumped now, I'm ready.
Hello.
Hey, Jake. It's Diane.
I, uh, heard you already caught
the bad guys. Congratulations.
Oh, thanks.
And I, uh, I got your test
results back, and you are...
good to go.
Wait, uh... you mean, I...?
I mean that you can
have sexual relations
without fear of, uh...
"intrahominid cross transference."
Ah...
yeah!
What?
Uh, nothing, nothing. Thanks, Diane.
Well, of course, uh...
it's important to find
the right girl, right?
I mean, not in the strictly scientific
sense of the word "important,"
but it's important.
Yeah, yeah, sure, absolutely.
It's not like I'm going to run out of
here and pick up the first girl I see.
Buenas noches.
Adios.
Yep, you are one super stud.
You mind if I join you?
Yeah. Yeah!
I mean, yeah, you can join me.
Are you sure? 'Cause you
can tell me to get lost.
That's usually my line.
Angela Wright.
Uh, Jake Foley.
- Hi.
- Hey.
For the record, Agent Foley,
is this the woman you picked up
in the Santa Costa hotel bar?
I didn't pick her up.
All right, you began
a relationship with this woman
in the middle of your mission
to Santa Costa. Yes?
No. No. I thought
the mission was over.
And you claim here
that you did not know
that she was an enemy
in possession of a stolen
weapon of mass destruction.
I don't claim.
I didn't know any of that.
Well, tell us, Agent Foley.
What exactly did you know about her?
You're double jointed! So am I.
Well, that does it, then.
We should get married.
Yes, yes. Think of all the things
that we have in common.
We're both in sales.
We both went to schools
on the east coast.
- We both met Katie Couric.
- Yes.
Well, I saw her.
That counts.
Before we get married,
I would like to know, um,
do you have a girlfriend?
No. No. You?
No, no girlfriend...
or boyfriend, or husband.
Okay.
Well, then, uh... there's
just one more question.
Then we get married for sure.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
Thank you. Um...
Thanks.
Why'd you come up to me tonight?
You have a nice place.
It's very trustworthy.
Thanks.
I get it from my mom's side.
Hmm.
The bedroom eyes from dad?
So, uh...
since I have a nice face,
and, uh, I like you...
seems like you like me, so...
what do you think about
continuing this, uh...
On the roof?
Well, I was thinking my room,
or-or maybe your room.
Or... ok-okay, the roof, if it's...
or you can just slap me in the face,
and get it over with.
I didn't say no.
You really are double-jointed.
So, she did go to your room?
Yes.
And you had NSA hardware,
which, if breached, could have
compromised your mission?
Excuse me.
He thought the mission was over.
Sit down, Agent Duarte.
What's your point?
That Jake had no idea our
case was falling apart.
I told you, I don't know how that
stuff got into my apartment.
It says here that's not
your primary residence.
I have a house outside of town.
But the apartment is where
you conduct business, right?
Charming view,
buy a little nerve gas?
No.
Then why'd you rent it?
He was having an affair?
With a woman from his office.
Said it was his first one.
Well, that'll teach him.
That's when we got the test
results back from the lab.
The vials we found
that morning were fakes.
I phoned Director Beckett
to give her the news,
and that's when I called Agent Foley.
And what was his response?
I wasn't able to reach him.
We have audio feed from the break-in.
- Yeah.
- Kyle.
Jake. I've been trying
to get ahold of you.
Yeah. I'm in my room with a woman.
Well, good for you.
No, no, she's the one
who stole the vials.
What? Stall her.
- I'll be there in 15 minutes.
- It's too late.
No, Jake, she still has the varcon.
The vials we picked up were fake.
What?
You have a shoot-to-kill order.
Enforce it.
I think you've got something of mine.
I need you to put down that handbag.
- This isn't what...
- Now.
Oh!
- Don't shoot!
- You don't shoot!
- Put down your gun!
- You put it down!
I'm CIA. I'm going to show you my ID.
Don't get trigger happy.
Whoever you're working for, it's pretty
obvious we're after the same thing.
Yeah, I think you already have it.
Angela Hamilton?
You said your name was Angela Wright.
I'm an intelligence officer.
What do you expect?
I'm sure your real name
isn't Jake Foley.
Of course not.
Why don't you just put your gun down,
and we'll figure this out together?
No, no. I'm not putting my gun down.
Fine.
Here.
There.
Okay?
Now, who are you?
I'm NSA
Great.
You're after the varcon as well.
I can't believe our idiot agencies.
You'd think they'd have figured this out by
now - tell one hand what the other is doing.
Why were you on my laptop?
I knew you were a wrong number.
What kind of watch salesman would
be caught dead wearing that?!
I needed to find out who you really
were and what you were up to.
What, by sleeping with me?
Let's get this all straightened out.
You call the CIA,
- call your people.
- Oh, I will.
Could you please?
Thank you.
For the record, Agent Duarte,
Jake Foley received
a direct order from you
to kill a rogue agent
and simply ignored it?
Yes.
But I'm not going to stand here
and tell you this operation
was a complete failure.
Duly noted.
Now, perhaps you could regale
us with some facts.
I arrived at Agent Foley's hotel room
shortly after his altercation
with Angela Hamilton.
Lou? It's Kyle.
We have a problem.
Buenos dias, Colonel.
Yes, I have all three.
I expect 80 apiece.
- I hope you take dollars.
- That's all I'll take.
- Where are you?
- Don't worry, I'll be there.
Excuse me, Agent Foley.
How long did you say you clung
to the underside
of Angela Hamilton's car?
I don't know... I don't know.
Two, two and a half hours.
That's impressive.
Can you imagine that power
in the hands of
a properly-trained agent?
Yeah. Imagine that.
Nano hearing.
Agent Foley...
just tell us what happened next.
- How...?
- Shut up.
Turn around.
Put your hands on the car.
Don't!
You're the one
who planted the fake vials.
You came up to my room
to see if we bought it.
And you did.
Turn around!
You have a shoot-to-kill order,
don't you?
Take another step, you'll find out.
It's not so easy, is it?
Putting a bullet
in somebody you know...
intimately.
Why are you doing this?
Why are you selling
this stuff to the rebels?
I'm not. I'm selling it
to the government.
The U.S. won't sell
the varcon gas anymore. I will.
All right. Hold it.
Just hold it right there.
Now, you have been warned
about mentioning
the use, manufacture, or sale
of varcon gas in the United States.
Agent Foley, I think
what Mr. Skerritt is trying to say
is for a government employee
to intimate that our government
would do such a thing
is considered treason.
I understand.
Thank you, Agent Foley.
Proceed with your story.
Okay.
The gas
that the united states government
would never manufacture -
the same gas
that the united states government
would never dream of
selling to a client state -
that exact same gas
was used to kill Angela
Hamilton's younger sister.
"Jessica had just
graduated from Penn."
And she was a speech therapy major.
She already had a job lined up.
She and her girlfriend were
backpacking through Central America.
They stopped in Golfito,
a little town on the coast here.
Didn't realize it was
a rebel stronghold.
One minute, they're having lunch
and the next, the whole
village is being gassed.
The U.S. never lifted a finger.
Never went after the guy
who gave the order,
nothing.
- Angela, whoever this guy is...
- I know exactly who he is -
Colonel Enrique Alonzo,
head of the Santa Costa
revolutionary guard.
It's army talk for death squad.
But we can tell people.
We can bring him in.
I gave them two and a half
years to bring him in.
When I knew they never would,
I left the agency.
So, now you're selling varcon
to the people who killed your sister.
No, you're not selling
the gas to them.
You're going to kill Alonzo with it.
I can't let you do that.
I don't think you have a choice.
- There she is!
- Oh, this is suicide.
But you already knew that.
Thank you for a perfect last night.
You're my partner.
You helped me steal the vials.
When they take me inside
the mobile lab, stay outside.
Good.
I just need the other two vials,
and we have a deal.
No, we have a deal when I deliver
the other two vials
to Colonel Alonzo.
Colonel Alonzo has other
matters to attend to.
Well, then we don't have a deal.
I'm sorry, but in fact we do.
Muchacho. Llevela afuera y matela.
(Take her outside and kill her.)
Angela!
Here!
I have to perform a tracheotomy.
It means I'm going to open
your airway, okay?
I've done this before.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Don't move.
I'm better.
And along with the team at Sat Ops,
I monitored the operation.
And did you feel at any time
that you lost control?
No. Field work is not
an exact science.
These operations take on
a life of their own
once all of the different
variables come into play.
Agent Foley was a party
to several murders
of one of our allies and
this is what you call a variable?
Agent Foley was pressed
into a difficult
and ethically challenging situation.
Once we became aware
of the deaths in Santa Costa,
I dispatched Agent Duarte
to extract him
and to finish the operation...
according to the orders
given me by my superiors.
They're all dead.
It was the American girl
and her friend.
Don't get too close.
Find them now!
What the hell are you?
I told you.
I'm an agent with the NSA.
I didn't ask who. I asked what.
You survived exposure to varcon gas.
Nobody does that.
Give me the other two vials.
I'm not done with them.
Alonzo isn't not dead yet.
- Angela.
- No.
All right.
I work with a Special
Ops team at the NSA.
A team that will do anything for me,
including bringing this
Alonzo guy in.
Jake, you say that,
but I know how these agencies work.
Well, that's not how I work.
And that's not how my superiors work.
You have my word.
Angela, if you try
doing this on your own,
this guy's going to vanish, and
then he will get away with murder.
Was that your sister's?
Yeah.
You know what the hardest thing is?
Watching the news.
Jessie used to yell
at the broadcasters,
not about the news,
but about the way they talked.
She was a speech therapist, you know?
"That guy's hiding a stutter."
"I could cure his cul-de-sac
resonance in a day."
"Talk about disfluency."
How are you today?
Hands in the air.
He's got the Varcon.
You shoot me, you'll be
dead in ten seconds.
- He's bluffing.
- No, he's not.
Do you know who I am?
No.
I'm a nurse in Zancuta going home
to cook dinner for her two children.
I'm a 12-year-old boy
on his way to soccer practice.
I'm a 22-year-old American girl
from Philadelphia
with her whole life ahead of her.
I am not afraid to die.
We'll see about that.
Jake!
Okay, it's okay.
- Angela Hamilton?
- Yes?
Kyle?
It's okay guys.
It's not necessary.
Kyle.
What's going on?
Kyle, what's going on?
No, I told her we could help her.
Jake, Jake, listen to me.
It's their country, okay?
Lou had to pull strings
just to get you out alive.
No, no, she trusted me, damn it!
Jake, listen to me.
It's out of our hands.
I'm sorry.
I was ordered to hand
Angela Hamilton over
to a government with
an abominable human rights record.
Right now, she's rotting
in one of their prisons,
while the country she once served
ignores the fact she's even alive.
Sit down, Agent Duarte.
Barring any further questions
from my colleagues,
I think we're done here.
We will review the evidence
and return our
evaluation of your unit
as soon as possible.
Until then, you'll be
restricted to desk work
and your movements
will be carefully monitored.
I'm sure you all understand.
No, I don't...
and I need to say something.
- You've said enough.
- No, I haven't!
This isn't about our
field performance.
This is about you
finding a scapegoat.
- You're out of line, son.
- Because I'm not afraid of the truth?
That we helped kill American citizens,
that we abandoned Angela Hamilton,
that we sold Varcon to Santa Costa,
and you hypocrites can't even
bring yourself to say the word?
Guards, escort Mr. Foley to a cell.
what's happening?
Our transcript is being uploaded.
What's he doing?
Tell them to stand down.
The transcripts for this hearing
are now in the server.
If I blink, everything
that's been said here today
will be e-mailed to the AP wire.
All of your dealings with the
repressive government of Santa Costa,
turning over Angela...
every paper in the country'll
have their hands on it.
Now, you want to shut us down,
send me off to be a lab rat the
rest of my life, be my guest...
but Angela is walking out
of that prison...
or else.
Chief Skerrit,
members of the board...
this might be an excellent
time for you
to reevaluate your perception
of my team.
If you think we are going to allow
ourselves to be blackmailed by you...
Sit down, Miles.
We see your point.
In light of your passionate
testimony today...
I think we shouldn't rush to judge.
This is an unorthodox unit.
It cannot be measured by
traditional notions
of intelligence work...
for the record.
This meeting is closed, then?
Yes. It's closed.
Okay, so-so we're free?
For the time being, yeah.
I need some tea
or something stronger.
- Are we allowed to drink on duty?
- No, but we're going to start.
Were you really going
to send that transcript out?
Sure, if the e-mail I made up
actually belonged to anybody.
Good work.
Leave us.
Spineless.
Excuse me?
No, I don't.
Letting them off was inexcusable.
I mean, what does that say about us?
It says we handled
the situation ineptly.
And, Miles, if you ever speak to me
in that tone of voice again,
I'll cut your tongue out.
I'm not being figurative.
Jim...
Louise Beckett is in many
ways an admirable woman.
You promoted her.
If she fails, so will you.
Duly noted.
Jake Foley is another matter.
Did you see the way
he stood up to us?
That's a soldier.
You like him?
Oh, my god, I hate and fear him,
but a man like that bent to your will
could accomplish anything.
I don't believe he's bent
to anyone's will.
No, that's the problem.
One I intend to rectify.
Thanks.
You all right?
I am now.

Jake Foley was an ordinary guy
until a freak accident
transformed him
into the world's first
computer-enhanced man.
Millions of microscopic computers
interface with his biochemistry
and make him stronger and faster,
able to see and hear farther
than normal men.
They give him the power
to control technology with his brain.
Jake Foley - America's secret weapon.
He takes on missions no
ordinary agent can perform.
He is the ultimate human upgrade.
Could you please identify
yourself for the record?
Agent Jake Foley,
the human subject
with millions of tiny robots inside.
Did you see the way he stood up to us
This isn't about our
"field performance",
this is about you
finding a scapegoat.
- You're out of line, son.
- that's a soldier.
- You like him.
- I hate and fear him,
but a man like that bent to your
will could accomplish anything.
I don't believe he's
bent to anyone's will.
You follow orders,
just like everyone else.
that's the problem.
One I intend to rectify.
All right. So who had
the chicken crisp?
That's me.
And Deputy Director Beckett?
What did you order?
Vegetable soup. Green salad.
Brown rice.
Now we know how she keeps
her girlish figure.
Oh! Here's my pepperoni pizza
with anchovies and artichokes.
The two A's that make
a meal worth having.
Mmm. Dig in, guys.
Mm-mmm.
We're clear.
The "two A's that make
a meal worth having"?
I'm not a spy, okay?
You guys are the spies.
I thought this war was
with our enemies out there,
not our superiors in here.
Well, get used to it.
There are factions upstairs who
don't want to see us succeed.
They're threatened by things
they can't control,
and they can't control you.
What?
Lou, Diane and I had a talk.
What, you're voting
me off the island?
No, but
we can have lives after this program.
We can move on.
You, on the other hand,
are the program.
If it shuts down, Jake...
What?
You going to put me in a cage five
miles underneath the rocky mountains?
Oh, god.
I have a contact,
an identity specialist.
He creates new lives for people
and erases the old ones.
He operates outside normal channels.
Now, what he does is neither
legal nor cheap.
But he owes me.
Big time.
If you want it,
there's a way out of this war.
Three hundred year-old rivalries
have flared up again
in Kembu, Africa.
A radical paramilitary faction
lead by General Iniko Baako
has broken last year's cease fire
and is attempting to overthrow
the parliamentary democracy
established by King Namir,
the patriarch of the
royal family of Kembu.
Namir issued this statement
early this morning.
Kembu is a country that
is run by its people,
and we will stand our ground
before this tyrant Baako,
as we always have.
And our allies from around the world
will stand with us.
His allies are us and the French.
Well, I guess when it comes
to the bleeding, that means us.
As long as the oil fields
of Kembu produce, it does.
What's the king asking for?
Very little, but he's
worried about his son.
The prince.
There has been no comment yet
from Prince Malik of Kembu
who's in attendance
at a private university
in the Washington, D.C. Area.
The unrest in Kembu
raises the potential
for an assassination attempt
on American soil.
Mm-hmm. How credible are the threats?
Judging from General Baako's
bloody track record,
I'd say very.
He doesn't just kill his enemies,
he kills their families.
We're talking about putting our
own agents in the line of fire.
I see.
What's Jake Foley up to?
Hello, Jake.
Hey, uh, hello,
Executive Director Warner.
Please, call me Valerie.
I just ran into Warner in the hall.
She was pleasant.
- Now I'm really scared.
- You should be.
- She has an assignment for you.
- Yeah? What is it?
Protecting Prince
Malik Namir of Kembu
until the unrest in his
country subsides.
Bodyguarding a Prince.
Doesn't sound so bad.
What's the catch?
It's dangerous. You could end up
between the prince and a bullet.
And it's delicate.
If the prince gets hurt,
Warner blames us.
You get hurt...
- Warner blames us.
- You are a good candidate.
You're close to the Prince's age
and you are the ultimate human
surveillance system.
We'd have a team of agents
working with you.
Kyle would head a group here,
profiling VISAs,
looking for potential sleeper cells
working for General Baako.
So you wouldn't be alone
out there. Still,
have you given any thought
to what we talked about?
It's about all I've been doing.
And?
And...
I haven't made a decision
on that front yet.
So, in the meantime,
I guess I wouldn't mind hanging
out with this prince guy.
You sure?
Yeah, so, uh, where am I going?
To live in a castle somewhere?
It'd be kind of cool to see a moat.
- Watch out!
- Ow.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
No need to put that in the reports.
Hi.
Sorry. Can you throw it here?
Sorry!
Hey, you guys know where
I can find Malik?
- Upstairs on the right.
- Thank you.
Oh, your highness.
I'm Jake Foley.
I was assigned to protect you.
Uh,
I'm with the NSA.
Jambo?
I don't believes he speaks swahili.
Actually, I grew up in Vermont.
- There's not a lot of call for it.
- Sorry.
- You're Jake?
- Yeah.
I'm Malik.
You bow to me, call me your highness,
anything like that, you're fired.
This is Tracey.
I know what you're thinking.
"Isn't that a woman's name?"
No, no, I wasn't thinking that.
Smart man.
- It's nice to meet you both.
- Likewise.
- So, you're my bodyguard.
- Yeah.
Are they downsizing at the NSA?
Well, didn't you hear?
Scrawny's the new big.
All right, ground rules.
I don't like guards
cramping my style,
and I can't have some guy
following me around campus
because that's not suave.
So, you keep your distance,
nobody gets hurt.
Uh, I'm afraid you might.
I was assigned to protect you, so,
I'm sorry, but that's
what I'm going to do.
- Hold on.
- It's cool, it's cool.
Is that so?
Pretty much.
You're not hanging with me, man.
- At least not in those clothes.
- What's wrong with these?
Nothing at all,
if you're going to a debate.
Come on.
Perfect.
You want me to wear that?
The crown prince of Tajir
didn't think it was so bad.
He wore it with pride.
Or I tell the NSA
you're not cooperating.
Can I borrow your cell?
All right. I'll be waiting.
Take your time.
All right, I'm coming out,
but I look like some
kind of muppet reject.
Jake, Jake,
I have the Prince on
the northeast perimeter.
Where are you?
- Yeah, I'm on him.
- Okay.
Excuse me, Tracey.
I'll excuse you in five minutes,
but until then,
my word to Malik and
two C-notes in my pocket
is keeping me right here.
Tracey, I'm going to give
you three seconds to move.
Or what?
- Where is he?
- He's going past the science building.
How'd you do that?
'Cause I'm good at my job.
You are never to get into a vehicle
unless I check it first.
I'm sorry.
So, how much is my freedom
going to cost me?
You can't bribe me, Malik.
Well, that's disappointing.
Yeah, well, like it or not,
you're stuck with me.
Have it your way.
- Seat belt.
- What?
Whoa...!
My last bodyguard, Bobby Dean -
he took two to the head.
- You ever seen brain?
- No.
It's nasty.
It's nothing personal,
Jake, it's really not.
It's just that bodyguards,
they get hurt.
Then you got to bring flowers
to the hospital, the grave...
Aren't you worried
about getting a ticket?
Two words - diplomatic immunity.
- Yeah, how about dying?
- That'll come soon enough.
In the meantime, I'm going to enjoy
every moment to the fullest.
Would you watch out?!
What? It was yellow.
General Baako's army swept
through the northern cities
of Ujeme and Nyumba
in war-torn Kembu today.
King Namir responded
by deploying troops
to the country's rich oil fields,
and, according to
unconfirmed reports,
Baako now controls two
of the country's
four electric plants.
How does the news know
that before we do?
- Well, they said it was unconfirmed.
- Well, it's confirmed now.
Baako has two of the electric plants?
No. Three.
The king told us two hours ago
he controlled all four.
- Well, he's lying.
- Well, he's our ally. Why would he lie?
To appear stronger
than he is, and Diane...
What, this doesn't really concern me?
Well, you know what? Jake does,
and if you're going to
assign him to the field,
I think I have a right to know
what's going on... ma'am.
Well, that's part
of the problem, Diane.
We don't know what's going on.
We need better intel.
We have people in the capital.
Who do we have that's
close to the king?
Uh, Jake is.
Well, he's guarding
the king's only son.
- Hello.
- How's it going with the Prince?
I'd say on a scale of one to ten,
it's about a two.
- Jake...
- No, it's fine. What do you need?
I need you to find out what his
father is telling him about the war.
Kyle, this guy's not exactly
thrilled to have me around.
You want me to spy on him?
We're the National Security Agency.
It's kind of what we do.
Look for any e-mails or
other communications.
If the king's going
to be honest with anyone,
it'll be with his son and heir.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Come on, come on, fellas.
You're all right, man,
you're all right.
Hey, you.
Hey. I was just, uh...
We need someone to fill in
for Little Mike. Can you ball?
I'm not exactly what the doctors
call coordinated.
Come on, Jake.
I mean, it's not like we going
to pass you the ball anyway.
Come on, man.
- Give me the ball.
- Come here.
Basically, you stay out of my way.
I'll take care of business,
all right?
Here we go! I'm ope... ah.
Sorry.
It's all right.
Jake!
Sorry.
I'm open!
Hey!
Ow. Hold on a second, guys.
- Sorry.
- Come here, Jake. Come here, man.
What did I say about
getting in my way?
- I'm doing my best.
- Are you?
Cause we're getting
blown out right now.
We're just wondering if Whitney
Houston and Kevin Costner
are going to toss it in or
keep playing. Come on, man
Shut your mouth, kid.
Sit this one out, Foley.
I can take care of it myself.
All right, all right.
Our ball.
Have you got a concussion,
or something?
Hey, you know when I said
I was doing my best?
I lied.
Whoo!
All right, Jake, okay.
All right.
Game point! Dish it off, Jake!
I'm open!
I'm open!
Ooh!
You just got schooled
by Kevin Costner.
That's what I'm talking about!
So, where'd you learn to play
like that, Foley?
Mean streets of Akron, Ohio. You?
The guarded royal compounds of Kembu.
Where I watched Michael Jordan,
game five at the forum,
win the bulls their first NBA finals.
Ah, you wanted to be like Mike.
No, no, just wanted him
to teach me how to play.
Dad flew him out for a week.
He showed me his crossover,
fadeaway, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah, I, uh, owned a pair
of Air Jordans once.
We may have more in common
than you think.
You're a good guy, Jake.
I don't say that often.
My father raised me to trust no one.
- What's he like?
- He's a good man.
Good as you can be
given his position.
He's done a lot of things
he's not proud of.
But people have been plotting against
my family for hundreds of years.
There's a legacy of bloodshed there.
Between you and me,
it's not something I want
to become a part of.
Who says you have to?
It's my destiny.
Can't change that.
I'm going to crash out.
You know what, Jake?
I'd visit you in the hospital.
But flowers - that's
where I draw the line.
All right, man,
I'll see you later.
Jake.
About the outfit.
Crown Prince of Tajir never wore
anything like this, did he?
No. But you can keep it.
Or burn it, or whatever.
Okay.
You know where I'll be.
All members of the royal family
must be eradicated to ensure
our complete success.
The prince is your primary target.
Jake. Jake.
Jake.
Jake.
Yeah, I'm here.
Jake, there's a breach
in dormitory security.
Someone just entered
through an emergency exit,
and they're headed your way.
Hands in the air!
Uh...
sorry.
Sorry.
Now I'm going to hand
Malik some utensils.
You're not going to try
and jump me, are you?
Well, if you try and assassinate him with
that spoon, you leave me little choice.
Tell me about yourself, Jake.
Do you know karate? Jujitsu? Kung-fu?
Uh, a little judo. Sixth grade.
So what exactly makes you qualified
to protect the Prince?
I mean, no offense, but
I could probably kick your ass.
Anna, he's cool.
Leave him alone, babe.
No, no. It's okay.
It's a valid question.
Um,
all I can really say is that
it's mostly up here.
Otherwise, it would kind of hard
to kill a man with your bare hands.
You killed a man
with your bare hands?
I don't know if that's the
truth or an ice cold bluff,
- but I'm feeling you, Foley.
- Fo'shizzle?
Okay. You don't need to do that.
Baby, I forgot to
invite Ryan tonight.
Hmm.
Don't worry. I'll see him in class.
- This party's going to be off the hook.
- For sure.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Party?
It's Malik's 21st birthday.
Well, happy birthday, but I don't think
a party's such a good idea right now.
We're having a party. I don't
care what your bodyguard says.
Anna, he is looking out for me.
If he doesn't think it's a good idea,
then it's his call.
All right, but you stay
by my side at all times.
Deal. All right, baby.
- We got to run.
- All right.
It's nice to meet you.
Mm-hmm.
So Anna seems like
a pretty nice girl.
Once you get to know her.
She's really special.
It's going to be hard when
I have to break up with her.
What are you talking about?
Eventually, I have to go
back and marry someone
whose lineage is deemed
worthy of a queen.
You're in an arranged marriage?
Yeah. My cousin Shawanda.
She's 14 years old.
Weighs 350 pounds.
Cute face, though.
Okay.
I'm messing with you, man.
I can marry anyone I want.
As long as she's another
royal from Kembu.
All right, so you're choice...
- well, you don't really have a choice.
- Exactly.
Hey.
Good job with Malik's PDA,
but aside from his social activities
calendar for the next six months,
- there was nothing on it we could use.
- I see.
Jake, we're getting a lot of
pressure from above.
Kembu's our biggest
oil supplier in the region.
You're going to have to dig deeper.
I'll see what I can do.
Moving on to some familiar calculus,
who can tell me how we show that
p-zero-one and this
inner product define
inner product spaces?
Am I to believe that
after a week of going over this,
no one knows the answer?
- What are you doing?
- I so know this.
And a brave warrior raises
his hand in the distance.
- Your name?
- Alan.
Uh, Alan Hergott.
Are you in my class?
I'm, uh, auditing.
Even more impressive.
Proceed to dazzle us.
Well, since we don't
have an intuitive picture
of the p-zero-one vector,
we just need to integrate the product
of the two factors and
evaluate from zero to one.
That'll give us a real number.
Well, that would be
an excellent answer
if it wasn't entirely wrong.
Now, who would like
to correct Mr. Hergott?
Atone for his failure.
His mistake
is in the interpretation of
the inner product definition.
We're not interested in
the value of the integral,
but that it satisfies the four
properties of the definition.
We can apply the properties
of the Riemann integral,
beginning with the
symmetry condition, and...
there you go.
Similarly, three other conditions
can be proven through the properties
of the Riemann Integral.
Good work, Malik.
Now we can prove some results
from the property spaces.
Nice brick back there
in front of class.
Yeah, yeah. It's not like I majored
in computer science or anything.
So, what do we got next?
Early 19th century Eastern
European literature.
Great.
I was actually looking forward
to coming back to college.
Hey, babe.
Find anything interesting,
Agent Foley?
What are you talking about, Ann?
I just saw your bodyguard
hand off something to a woman
I can only assume
was another NSA Agent.
What was it?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
What was it?
Jake?
I can't tell you.
You... you're not protecting me.
You're spying on me.
- I told you he was bad news.
- Nothing personal, right?
You know, I was actually starting to
trust you. I should have known better.
Malik...
- Stay away from me, Foley.
- You know I can't do that.
- You're fired.
- What?
You heard me. Get out of here.
You can't fire me!
He fired me.
Anything from Jake?
King Namir sent the Prince
an e-mail yesterday.
And?
You tell me.
"The flowers have all faded...
blow if you will, autumn wind."
I didn't know the king was a poet.
He's not.
These are the last words
of Lord Usagi in Feudal Japan
just before he was beheaded.
I think the King is trying
to send his son a message.
That he's going to lose the war.
Or his life.
If the king is this vulnerable,
General Baako will make sure
there's no heir left
to assume the throne.
We've just red-flagged
three student visas.
Possible Baako sleepers.
Stream the pictures to Jake.
Make sure he stays
close to the prince.
Come on, Trace. Let me in.
Hey, the name's Tracey,
and you're not on the list.
Yes, I am on the list. I see my name.
It's right there.
That's right. It says, "Don't let
Jake Foley in." Now, get out of here.
- What's up?
- How ya doing?
- All right. Peace.
- Have fun.
Why are you still here?
Look, I can call the NSA and
shut this whole thing down.
Go for it.
Hello!
We've got some hits.
Potential sleepers.
I'm sending you their pictures now.
Don't lose sight of the prince.
Well, that's going to be kind
of difficult 'cause he fired me.
- He can't fire you.
- That's what I said.
Listen, Jake, you need to fix this.
- If the brass finds out...
- Hey, it was your stupid idea
to start spying on him
in the first place.
Just hold on. Let me look at these.
Kyle, I saw this guy.
He just went into the party.
I'm sending backup.
Get to the prince... now.
Yeah.
- Foley! It's not going to happen.
- Sorry, Tracey.
- For what?
- This!
Hey, hey, hey!
Excuse me, excuse me.
Pardon me, excuse me... sorry.
Pardon me... excuse me.
Malik!
What's up Daddy? Baby!
You're so good!
Yeah, so... I'm in
the middle of something.
Malik!
Aww...
Malik!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah. All right. I understand.
All right.
Thanks.
And for the record... you're rehired.
I can't believe this.
It's okay, baby. Everything's
going to be all right.
We just received intel from Kembu.
- The war over?
- Yes.
The king is dead.
What is it?
Malik, your father's dead.
West perimeter. Got it covered.
Copy that.
Displace to rear parking lot.
I say again, rear parking lot.
- Stairwells?
- We're green.
- Now I want a man on every rooftop.
- Yeah.
King Namir's assassination
virtually assures
that General Inako Baako
will be Kembu's new ruler.
Now, the State Department
has not issued
an official response
to the rebel coup,
except to say that so far,
the situation remains fluid.
Can I get you anything?
I'm fine.
We got to go.
- Kyle...
- It's not open for discussion.
Lou needs to see you, now.
Don't go. We want you here.
I'm sorry.
Look, we're leaving an army here,
nothing's going to happen,
I promise.
Sorry about your father, Malik.
At which point I used the necessary
force to enter the dormitory
where I found the suspect armed and
directly threatening Prince Malik.
But you guys already know all this.
Why'd you bring me here?
Jake, your work was exemplary.
But you're not sending me back.
Well, who's protecting him?
The prince is going to have
to make his own arrangements.
We've been ordered to pull
our security detail.
That's straight from Director Warner.
He's as good as dead without us.
He needs us.
Tomorrow morning, the state department
is going to announce the commencement
of diplomatic talks with
Baako's new government.
We're changing sides.
Just like that.
Whatever happens, Jake,
you went in there as ordered,
you proved yourself,
you proved our unit.
It's a small victory, but we
have to take what we can get.
We promised to protect the prince.
Yes, we did.
Agent Foley.
I'm glad to see you're okay.
I'm glad you're glad.
Excellent work tonight.
Prince Malik won't be
so lucky the next time.
King Malik.
If he can rule a country,
he can procure his own bodyguards.
You didn't have to give
the order to abandon him.
Do you know something I don't?
This agency's job is to uphold
the nation's foreign policy.
Protecting the enemy of our new
ally contradicts that policy.
And you're fine with that?
I'm an instrument
of our country's will.
So is everyone in this building,
including you.
An instrument.
Word of advice?
Leave your politics at home.
- And my ethics?
- Not my call.
I barely know you.
Malik!
Malik?
There's nothing more
I can do. It's over.
Don't worry, man.
I'm not going to jump.
Even if I tried,
you'd probably save me.
Listen, uh...
I have some bad news.
The United States
has changed its mind.
Baako's your man now.
Hey...
just because we're not
offering you asylum
doesn't mean somebody else won't.
You see those lights over there?
That's embassy row.
Go over there any night of the week
and somebody's throwing a party.
Only tonight,
they all must be partying,
because not a single one of them
has returned my phone calls.
The South African ambassador said
he'd call you in the morning.
He's going to be busy.
He'll be in a meeting.
You don't know that.
Anna, I grew up watching this dance.
I know when it's over.
Thank you, Jake.
For what? I didn't do anything.
You did all you could.
It's my destiny.
People who run this place - Skerritt,
Warner - they don't even consider
Malik a human being anymore.
He's a loose end.
Yeah, well, that's how they
look at the world.
Not going to change.
You didn't think it would, did you?
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess I did.
Go figure.
I just, uh...
What?
I just think you need
to make peace with it,
because at the end of the day,
there's nothing you can do about it.
I don't know if I can
do this anymore, Diane.
Jake, if, uh...
if you decide that this life
isn't for you, and...
if I come here tomorrow and
you're not here... I just...
I want you to know
that I would understand.
And I'd really, really miss you.
Are you sure you want to do this?
I just don't see any
other way around it.
So,
thanks for everything
you taught me.
Yeah, well...
I'm sorry it wasn't enough.
Mr. Wenk.
Oh, call me Earl. Everyone does.
Actually, everyone that does
ends up dead to the world.
So how do we do this?
We don't do anything.
You give me your car,
I.D., credit cards,
kiss them good-bye.
Couple of days from now, one of your
neighbors notices a horrible stench.
Cops break down the door,
find the decomposed remains of a man
your height, weight, color
in a tub of maggoty slime.
Apparent suicide.
I call that "the bowl of soup."
I could also blow you up in your car.
That one I call "The Erik Estrada."
Also known as "The Ponch."
- Where do you get the body?
- The morgue.
I only kill people on paper.
Anyway, while I'm out desecrating
the dearly departed,
you're on a train to sunny Jalisco
with a brand-new identity.
The identity, is it bulletproof?
Kevlar.
Let's get this straight.
This is a one-time deal.
A favor for your buddy Kyle.
After tonight, you're dead to me.
More importantly,
you're dead to the world.
You don't come back from this one.
Lou...
hey, I thought that
I would find Jake here...
maybe.
You won't.
Jake.
Hey. You're late
for your morning work-up.
Director Beckett, Agent Duarte,
something you need to see.
In another tragedy for
the royal family of Kembu,
Prince Malik, last remaining
heir to the throne,
was killed in a car bombing
early this morning.
Also killed, an unnamed
female companion.
Now, the deaths come only hours
after the state department
announced it's support
of the regime change.
Why don't we take a walk?
We're clear.
I know what you did.
You took The Prince and his girlfriend
to see Mr. Wenk, didn't you?
You do realize that was
a one-time only deal?
You gave Malik your
ticket to a new life.
He needed it more.
You have a good heart, Jake.
I'm not so sure about your timing.
The guy who was after
the prince gave her up.
Her real name is Ayana Karanga.
She's a part of General
Baako's radical group.
She was sent in a year ago
to get close to the Prince.
I sent her away with him.
I know.
And now she's going to kill him.
No, no, no, no, no.
You and I cannot be seen together.
Just tell us where Prince Malik is.
Never heard of him.
You know as well as I do,
once they're gone, they're gone.
Not this time.
The girl he's with
is trying to kill him.
- Not my problem.
- Earl,
listen to me very carefully.
You're not the only one who knows
how to make people disappear.
Fine. Fine.
But I'm never going
to help you again, ever.
Where are they?!
What's the matter?
Nothing. It's great, right?
We're finally out.
This is what you
always wanted, Malik.
So why do I feel like a coward?
You're not a coward.
I take it we're not
calling in for backup?
We're going to have
to handle this ourselves.
I love you.
I love you, too, babe.
They told me to get close to you,
but I got too close.
- What?
- I'm sorry.
Anna, stop!
Stop! Don't do this! Anna, stop!
Lay down!
Hey!
Don't move!
- Are you okay?
- Let her go! Let her go!
Let her go! She's trying
to kill herself!
She couldn't kill me,
so she tried to kill herself.
Let her go.
It's all right.
It's not all right. It's
never going to be all right!
It's been going on
for three hundred years!
Shh.
- We can escape.
- We can't escape it.
Jake! Are you all right?
It's okay. Come here.
She's right.
You can't escape it.
But you might be able to change it.
In world news,
Prince Malik of Kembu,
believed dead in a car
bombing earlier this week
has re-surfaced in his homeland.
Seen here in a videotape
broadcast throughout Africa,
the prince has married
a former Baako loyalist,
and has now marshaled
a coalition army
to retake his country.
You wanted to see me, ma'am?
Yes.
Did you know about this,
Agent Foley?
Yes, I did.
I heard about it on the radio.
It's an amazing story, isn't it?
Unbelievable.
That man may just have what it
takes to reclaim his throne.
I don't doubt it.
The real question is
who are we going to back?
The winner, of course.
Good night, Jake.
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
Jake Foley was an ordinary guy
until a freak accident transformed him
into the world's first
computer-enhanced man.
Millions of microscopic computers
interface with his biochemistry
to make him stronger and faster,
able to see and hear
farther than normal men.
They give him the power to control
technology with his brain.
Jake Foley - America's secret weapon.
He takes on missions no
ordinary agent can perform.
He is the ultimate human upgrade.
I thought this war was with our enemies
out there, not our superiors in here.
Either the board is satisfied
with your explanations
or we terminate the program.
They're threatened by things
they can't control,
and they can't control you.
I don't know if I can do
this anymore, Diane.
I have a contact.
He creates new lives for people
and erases the old ones.
I thought that I would find Jake here.
You won't.
Jake... you're back.
This is four-one-Baltimore,
who has visual on the subject...?
- I did, but I lost contact.
- Where?
Northeast quadrant.
Damn it, who has the subject in sight?
I got her. She's heading south,
toward the river.
Who's got her?
Who said that?
Me. Uh, Jake... Six-Two-Denver.
Say your number first.
Jake, stay put, we're on our way.
Okay, she's... she's heading
toward a car. She's going to bolt.
- Jake, stay put.
- This is Beckett.
Dankova must not get away.
Use all necessary force.
- Is that a shoot to kill?
- That is affirmative...
Lou, we need Dankova alive.
Hold the shoot to kill
unless it's the only resort.
Wait until we get there!
Don't let her get away, Jake.
- Don't do anything until...
- Oh, would you just shut up!
Ow.
Now, how could this happen?
How did he let Dankova get away?
"He" practically got tire marks
on his face from trying to prevent it.
Is it so hard for you
to do what we tell you?
Yeah, when you're telling me
fifteen different things, yeah.
Put it up.
Yeah... no, the leg's fine.
Thanks for asking.
- Why don't you try and be useful.
- All right, all right.
We had Elena Dankova in
our sights and we lost her.
This woman is a former KGB
operative who tried to sabotage
our Wilmington nuclear
facility in 1986.
We narrowly avoided
our very own Chernobyl.
Now, Dankova is a true believer.
She went rogue the day
the Berlin wall came down.
As far as she's concerned,
the cold war never ended.
Let's see if we can track her down
and see if we can
hold on to her this time.
And don't be afraid to think
outside the box.
Hey, Lou... what do you think
about bringing in the agent
who was point man on
Dankova in the eighties?
Are you talking about Richard Fox?
Uh, yeah. He has a lot of
commendations.
Fox.
Big deal back in the day?
The biggest.
He single-handedly captured
Mikail "The Shark" Petrovitch.
That was the beginning
of the end of the KGB.
Retired in eighty-eight.
- Where's he living?
- Here in D.C.
File says he has two addresses.
Bring him in.
You're about to meet a legend.
Call me. I mean it.
If you don't, I will hunt
you down like a dog.
Bye, baby.
You got company.
- Excuse me.
- Sure.
Y'all lawyers or bill collectors?
NSA.
I'm Agent Duarte,
this is Agent Foley.
Sir, would you please put that away?
We were hoping we could talk
to you about Elena Dankova.
You are Richard Fox?
Call me Dick.
Anybody want a Fresca?
No, thanks.
Well...
Smoke bother you?
Uh... no.
Maybe...
You know, she always
was a real bastard.
You boys have got a problem, all right.
Well, that's why we came to see you.
What do you think
we should do, Mr. Fox?
Dick.
Well, first I think you should find her
and then kill her.
Good luck.
At the risk of sounding corny,
your country needs you.
Oh, shucks, really?
I gave 'em thirty years of my life
and they gave me this nifty watch
and they need me now?
Tell you what I'll do -
$80,000 retainer, and I'm all yours.
I don't think we can do that.
I was just kidding. Make it fifty.
Actually Mr... Dick,
your NSA contract is pretty
specific on the matter:
You can be recalled to
active duty at any time.
Failure to comply
can result in arrest,
confinement and/or
cessation of pension.
I thought you were the smart one.
Me, too.
Well, I guess I better get
gussied up and get some clothes on.
But we do this, we do it my way.
Is that clear, boys?
You can take that up with the boss.
Oh, I will.
What's his name?
Deputy Director Louise Beckett.
Well, hot damn. Fill me in.
All right.
We suspect that Elena Dankova
slipped into the country four days ago.
Since that time, we've had sightings
of her in Cincinnati and Chicago.
We know for a fact that she
was here in D.C. Yesterday.
How so?
We had her in our sights
and we lost her.
Who was the pinhead
that let that happen?
Uh...
I would be that pinhead.
Oh, The Smart One.
Were you sober?
Yeah. Of course.
Well, that was your first mistake.
And were you doing everything
they were telling you to do?
I was trying.
Kid, you got a lot to learn.
Can we could move forward, please?
Copy that, sir.
Listen up -
Chicago, Cincinnati, D.C.-
Run these names: Nicolai Iskanov,
alias Nolotov;
Liam Petrov, A.K.A. Kovalev;
and Max Romanov,
alias Petrenko and/or Bulgakov.
My guess is Dankova's
has contacted sleepers
left behind after the collapse
of the soviet empire.
- Why?
- Well, to finish the job
that we stopped her from doing in '86.
Are you saying she's planning another
attack on a U.S. Nuclear Facility?
I'm saying that if it looks,
sounds, feels radioactive,
I'd park my ass in front
of it with an M-16.
You never gave up, did you?
Cold war ends and
you're a relic overnight.
Betrayed by your own country.
I know how you feel, Lenochka,
but you shouldn't have set
foot on American soil.
Going to have to bring you down.
Bring you down hard, baby.
I think I have something.
There's a Max Petrenko,
living in Atlantic City...
well, he was living there. I don't see any
hits on him in the last couple of years,
but he has a line of credit
at something called "Rudolph's Red."
- Is that a casino? I never heard of it.
- Russian mob joint.
It's off the boardwalk,
low-rent, high-rollers.
- You got a facial?
- I've got a passport picture.
That's our man - Romanov.
One of the soviet union's
top nuclear engineers.
I'll bet bucks to beans he's the key
to whatever Dankova's got up
her sleeve. Good work, son.
I've got a Nicolai
Nolotov in Cincinnati.
Okay, I want teams in the field.
One to Cincinnati to pick up
Nolotov, one to Chicago.
Smart boy and me here
will take Atlantic City,
if that's all right with you, boss.
- You want to partner with Jake?
- Yeah.
- Why?
- Best man for the job.
He let Dankova get away once.
I don't think he'll let
that happen again.
I want you checked out
by medical staff.
Whatever you say, boss.
Get me Homeland Security.
Was there something else?
Sure got real pretty eyes.
Okay.
No, no, no. Not on my watch.
Oh, pretty and tough.
I'll be right back.
Just take your shirt off.
Okay, but I expect you to do likewise.
So, you and the doc there -
you got a little thing?
No, no, no. We're just colleagues.
What's that, a fancy
word for "friends"?
Yeah, I guess.
You kids nowadays.
You know a man and a woman
can't be just friends.
They got to be lovers or enemies.
Like you and Elena Dankova?
Well, sometimes,
it's a little of both.
And why is your shirt still on?
- Uh...
- And if you say, "why is yours?"
You'll stick a scalpel in me.
Yes, something like that. All right.
Look, I'm as fit as I'm going to be.
- Me and the kid here, we got work to do.
- Yeah.
Not until you get a full medical
work-up. See, I have orders.
Let me see that.
Yeah, well, you do everything
they tell you in this joint,
you'll go nuts.
No, no, no. But, you can't...
- Uh...
- Hey, Lou.
Is he ready yet?
- Uh...
- A hundred percent.
Let's get this show on the road.
Jake, this one's by the book.
All right.
Just wait till you see this.
You're not going to believe it.
That salesman never saw me coming.
Vintage Mach I. Only three thousand
of these babies left in the states.
Oh, sweet. They don't
make 'em like this anymore.
You just spent almost every penny
in our expense account on a car?!
What are we gonna
live on in Atlantic City?
What am I gonna tell Lou?!
You always wound this tight?
Kid, this car is the mission.
It's your ass on the line out there.
How you look, how you
feel, what you drive
can be the difference in coming
back alive or in a body bag.
The number-crunchers
back at headquarters,
they'll never understand
a thing like that.
You want to know
the secret to this job?
- Okay.
- Get in.
"Go with your gut."
At the end of the day, the only thing
that matters is that you
get the job done right.
Okay, kid, you ready
to have a little fun?
Yeah! Ha-ha!
Now, this is what going
undercover's all about.
Romanov has a big line of credit,
so I'm guessing he's a high roller.
Maybe we should...
What are you doing?
I'm ordering a pizza.
What does it look like I'm doing?
That's all the money we have left.
I'll play these three hands.
Four hundred on each and
an extra hundred for the dealer.
- Thank you, sir. Good luck.
- Dick!
If you want to look like a high
roller, you got to act like one.
Twenty-one.
- You won?
- All right. Double down here.
Yes, sir.
Are you just going
to stay here and gamble?
No, I'm going to stay here
and gamble and... drink.
Winner.
Cocktails.
Why don't you go look for some
big guys in expensive suits?
They would be the Russians.
Hey, honey, let me have a double scotch
and drinks all around, huh?
Hit me here.
All right. I'll stand.
Twenty-one.
Thanks, sweetheart.
I was getting thirsty.
There you go, darling.
- Thank you.
- Cutie.
Hey, see that poker table
on the other side of the room?
The guy at the end - Is he one of them?
Only one way to be sure.
This will be phonetic Russian, okay?
I want you to join the game.
Wait for him to make a bet,
and when he does,
say this to him. If he says "da,"
finish the hand.
We'll wait for him outside.
- Uh, maybe I should hold onto...
- I'm in.
Or not.
What do we have?
Liam Petrov. One of
the names Fox gave us.
A team in Chicago
just found him... dead.
Murdered in his own home.
Two bullets right through the eyes.
- Dankova's trademark.
- Nice lady.
My guess is whatever
Dankova has planned,
- Liam wasn't going along.
- Why would he?
A hundred and fifty K a year
making plumbing equipment,
four-bedroom house in the suburbs.
Capitalistic imperialism's
been very good to him.
It gets worse.
Nicolai Iskanov was working
at the hope creek nuclear
reactor under an alias.
He hasn't reported to work in a week.
Around the same time,
one hundred curies of cesium 137
disappeared from their waste depository.
- They're making a dirty bomb.
- Yeah, that'd be my guess.
I've notified FBI, CIA,
Homeland Security.
All right, make sure we're
sharing intel as it comes in.
Last thing we need is another
communication breakdown.
Set up around-the-clock feeds.
New York City and D.C.
Radiation sensors.
We're on it.
T'voya mahts vonyayet kak abyeziana.
(Your mother smells like a monkey.)
"Moya mahts vonyayet kak abyeziana."
(My mother smells like a monkey.)
Ya yevo oobyu. (I will kill him.)
You wouldn't think that skinny
kid could fight that good.
What do you say we get out
of here? Grab your money.
What?
Oh...
Director Beckett, I've got Jake.
- Beckett.
- I need a shoot to kill order.
What?
Dick - your legend - spent all our money,
tried to have me beaten
to death by strangers,
and then ditched out on the
mission with a cocktail waitress.
- Why didn't you notify me earlier?
- That's a very good question.
Look, the Atlantic City field
office is tenth and park.
- Can you get there?
- Yes. What about Dick?
Sounds like he's got some issues.
At any rate, you're
both off the mission.
And Jake, I look forward to your report.
Yeah.
I've been looking all over
for you, son. Come on. Get in.
No.
Okay, so you're pissed. I get it.
Why don't we go somewhere, grab
a couple of beers and talk about it?
There's nothing to talk about.
We're off the mission.
It's over. Finito.
Sounds like you've been talking
to the suits back home.
Yeah, I was. And if I were you,
I'd turn around and leave me alone.
I can't do that, kid.
Get in.
I'm not too proud to beg.
All right, hand it over.
Come on. Give it to me.
Back in my days, these things
were the size of a thermos.
So damn heavy, they
practically gave you a hernia.
Roll down your window.
You're making a big mistake.
Yeah, I've been hearing
that all my life.
Still doesn't phase me.
Apologies for the note.
These Russians, they
got no sense of humor.
You tried to get me killed!
If I wanted you dead, I would have
been a little more creative than that.
I was just testing you
to see what you're made of.
You know, your life's in your
partner's hands in this game.
You handled yourself well.
Gee, thanks.
Maybe a little too well.
What do you want?
I want to know what you are.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yes, you do.
What did those bastards
at the NSA do to you, kid?
You know, you and I may have
more in common than you think.
Way back when you were just a tickle
in your daddy's pouch,
the NSA had these programs.
Enhancement programs: Steroids,
G-H-B, H-G-H.
Those were just the training wheels.
They moved up from there.
And you were...
Quid pro quo. And I asked you first.
Look, I know it's hard.
They can really screw you up.
You don't know what
you can or can't say,
who to listen to, who to trust.
Sorry about the gun.
It was a little heavy handed,
but you wouldn't have gotten
back in the car otherwise.
They, uh,
they did do something.
I can't really get into specifics.
There was an accident...
Yeah, there's always an accident.
What was that?
What was what?
Is there someone in the trunk?
No. You kidding?
Dick, open it up.
Okay, Mr. Paranoid.
Here have a look.
Vsyo gatovah. Davai.
(Everything is ready. Come on.)
Throw your weapon out of the car,
then step out.
Arms in the air.
Lenochka, don't you trust me anymore?
I slept with you many times,
but I never trusted you.
That's no way to build
a lasting relationship.
Do you have it?
But of course.
Open it.
You know, I don't take rubles.
Who does anymore?
Who did ever?
It's been a pleasure.
Call me.
You are so lucky you
don't have a concussion.
You just have some lacerations and
some bruises that should heal in, like...
well, very soon.
I hear they got every
available agent out there
looking for Dick and that car.
Between you and me, I thought
that guy was kind of a nutcake.
Jake?
Diane,
before the nanite project,
were there any other
enhancement programs?
Um...
um, I mean, I'm not familiar with any,
but I would have to say
that there were, yeah.
I mean, the NSA has more research money
than any other intelligence agency
and they have a mandate
to stay ahead of the curve, so...
why?
Do you think they did
something to Dick?
Uh, it's just...
I'm not sure that guy really is crazy.
I have a feeling he knew exactly what
he was doing every step of the way.
Excuse me.
Lab.
Okay, yes, ma'am, right away.
Lou says there's something in SAT OPs
that we have to see right this instant.
Okay.
Dick?
My name is Richard.
And having armed guards
hovering over me like this
is not the way to treat someone who
bled for this agency for thirty years.
I've been in Finland for the past
month doing some consulting work.
I came as soon as I got your message.
Now how can I help you?
Uh...
Look, I don't know what kind
of mind game you're running,
but you've got some explaining to do.
Look, you called me.
I'm reporting to duty per the
activation clause in my contract.
And with all due respect,
I don't understand
how the NSA shared
critical mission information
without first verifying the
identity of an operative.
Wait. Hold on.
So I just spent thirty-six
hours with what?
A double? Decoy? Clone?
There's no such thing, Jake.
- You've been watching too many spy movies.
- Don't be too sure.
Does this mission have anything
to do with Ex-KGB Agents
from the former Soviet Union?
We don't share any information with
you until we find out who you are.
Well, then let me do the sharing then.
Classified archive
Delta-X-ray-Oscar Niner.
The Crimean Project.
A joint operation by the KGB/GRU set up
to collect biometric data
on American Intelligence assets.
The goal was to destabilize
our intelligence-gathering ability
by creating doubles of American agents
using plastic surgery, drugs,
advanced language
and cultural conditioning.
I was to be one of the targets.
So whoever's doing
this must have known
I'd be out of the country
before activating their plan.
Can't find the archive
in the computer, Dick.
You're not going to find the
Crimean Project on a computer.
It's on microfiche in the basement.
Code named "Double,"
classified and secured under
the 1982 National Security Act.
It's only accessible to
Deputy Directors and above.
And you may refer to me
as "Richard" or "Agent Fox."
Okay, Agent Fox.
Let's hope, for your sake, that I come
back from the basement with a file.
Keep your eyes on this man.
While I'm waiting,
I hope someone's here
to take my blood and fingerprints.
That'd be you, little lady?
I didn't know they let agents wear
their hair that long nowadays.
Yeah. I'm a regular old beatnik.
From the looks you're giving me,
that impostor must have
done quite a job on you.
You know, if you'd gone by the book,
none of this would've happened.
You know, I'm not ready to take
lessons from you just yet.
Well, I'm not ready to give them.
It's all here. The Crimean Project.
Looks like the soviets
really were trying
to copy our agents
using plastic surgery.
- So he's legit?
- Apparently.
Now if his fingerprints
and blood match our files,
we're going to have to give
him the benefit of the doubt
- and debrief him on the mission.
- What about trusting him?
Absolutely not.
Good. Any word on the mustang?
Sat-ops is working with local law
enforcement up and down the seaboard.
We'll find him. In the meantime,
I want your eyes on Richard 24-7.
Yeah.
This is odd.
Yeah, but DNA does not lie.
This is Richard Fox.
And I looked at those
Crimean Project files.
Everything they were doing to duplicate
our agents is medically feasible.
I mean, it's dangerous
and nuts but it's doable.
Hey, you remember that cigar
that Dick left in your lab?
- Yeah, you want me to run DNA on it?
- Yeah.
Excuse me.
All right. Agent Fox has
been brought up to speed.
I want you to give him
your full cooperation.
And we don't have much time.
Look, I'm sorry you were duped, son.
But the soviet agent
that was impersonating me
was using you to find out
everything the NSA
knows about Dankova's plan.
And we're three steps behind them.
- We've got to level the playing field.
- Seems to me the best way of doing that
is by finding the impostor.
Why don't we take a look at the
security tapes from that casino.
Okay.
And you thought that was me?
Look at the way he carries himself.
Did you look at any of
the pictures in my file?
All right, stop frame right there.
- What do you see?
- Dick's flirting with the waitress.
Look closer.
I don't know, he's playing her.
He's making like a high roller.
He distracted you once;
don't let him distract you again.
Okay. Uh...
The girl?
Cute. Fair skin.
High cheekbones.
Strong chin, possibly...
slavic.
Hey, can you pull up
that photo of Romanov?
Okay.
Okay, now freeze on the
waitress and enhance.
Romanov's daughter?
Romanov took his own
life two years ago.
Couldn't hack it in
the new world order.
She was a student at
The Central Academy
for Advanced Physics in Voronezh.
When the wall fell she came
to Atlantic City with her father.
Why is she serving drinks at a casino?
Our country's full of highly-educated
immigrants doing menial jobs.
The point is, she has the know-how
to put that bomb together.
He walked out of there with her,
- put her in the trunk of his car...
- and delivered her to Dankova.
- Right under my nose.
- Clear the board!
All stations on alert,
we have a red ball.
This was on its way to a Moscow
TV station for broadcast tomorrow.
We intercepted it from
a private courier company.
At midnight last night,
we cut out the heart of our enemy.
After years of humiliation,
we stand proud,
defiant and soviet to the end.
This is a code six:
We believe these people plan
to detonate a dirty bomb in D.C.
tonight at midnight.
Exactly one hour from now.
Rewind. Kill the audio.
- You see something?
- Yeah. That.
Magnify frame 1,000 percent.
Shift focus to the window.
Can you enhance it further
and ID the plane?
Not without pixelation.
It's all we've got.
They may have shot this
in sight of the glide path
for Reagan, Dulles or BWI.
Get me Homeland Security.
I want choppers in the air
with radiac detectors now.
The rest of you, you have
exactly five minutes
to find the most likely
locations for this device.
Kyle, assemble the strike teams.
Lou, Agent Fox and I
made some progress.
I think finding his double's
the best way to stop this.
I don't. I want every available agent
trailing this device.
Is that understood?
What do you think?
I think we have our orders, son.
Backup clip,
check, body armor plate, secure.
Strike team, this is Thunderbird.
We're less than ten from the target.
- Diane, hey.
- Jake,
I just got the preliminary
result on that DNA.
Okay. Thanks.
What was that?
Hang on to something.
Who broke formation?
What the hell are you doing?
You are jeopardizing this mission.
You turn that car back around.
That's an order.
Kyle, bring him into compliance
by any means necessary, now.
Damn it, Jake, what are you doing?
I'll tell you what I'm not doing.
I'm not stopping this car.
This is a flagrant breach of protocol.
Kyle, you gonna have
to trust me or shoot me.
What are we doing here?
Mustang Mach I. That's him.
Lou, this is Kyle.
I think we found Agent Fox's impostor.
He's here. Son of a bitch.
- I'm going in.
- No, wait!
Jake.
Down! Hit the floor now.
Screw you and get out of my house.
You want me to shoot, I'll shoot.
Good call, kid.
Now I'm going to put an end to you
and everything you stand for.
No, you won't.
You know you can't execute
someone without an Order.
In your case, I think
I can make an exception.
Lima one, do we have a visual?
Negative on that, Thunderbird.
Proceed to southeast
and northwest corners.
Copy that.
SAT Ops, do you have
anything on the location?
No unusual activity
on the radiac sensors.
And thermal imaging shows
nothing moving inside the building.
Thunderbird, again. It's a negative.
We have the wrong location.
Reports are coming in
from the other teams.
Negative on Delta.
Negative on Sierra.
Negative on Bravo.
Kyle, did you find him?
Sort of.
- He may be our only chance.
- We're working on it.
What happened to him?
The NSA.
Thirty years of being pulled
every which direction.
God knows what else they did to him.
Split him in half.
Richard...
- I don't think you wanna do that.
- This man's an enemy agent.
Who can lead us to
Dankova and the bomb.
Kid makes a good point.
Shut up.
He screwed you once.
He'll screw you again.
That's why I need you, Richard.
To make sure that he doesn't.
I need you, Richard. And Dick.
I need you both.
All right, kid.
Now, let me tell you the plan.
What?
We have a location! Let's move out.
All right. Let's go!
It's ready.
Once we're clear the
blast area, we detonate.
SAT Ops just confirmed heat signatures
for five people inside the location.
Stealth is crucial.
I want snipers first at the scene
and fully deployed before
the ground assault.
Repeat, stealth is crucial.
Open the door.
Pack up the van.
Weapons down! Now!
Now!
Stand back!
We're getting too
old for this, Lenochka.
Did they offer you more money?
Don't I wish.
Go ahead, knock yourself out.
Boom.
Anytime, Agent Foley.
Were you waiting till
the last possible moment?
She was working with you?
Well, I did promise Miss Romanov
a little something
if she helped us out.
It's all yours.
Very nice.
So's the hundred grand in the trunk.
Also, my phone number's
in the glove box.
It comes standard.
The whole time, he was
two steps ahead of us.
He tracked Romanov at the casino,
told her we needed
somebody on the inside.
Then he paid her to rig the
bomb so it wouldn't go off.
My office 0700 tomorrow morning.
Special commendation from
The Secretary of Defense.
It's not every day
you stop a dirty bomb.
We have a problem, Jake,
and something's going to have to give.
There are people upstairs who
don't like the way you do things,
and they would love nothing
morethan to shut us down.
Now I do everything in
my power to protect you,
but there's a limit to what I can do.
So at the very least, when I give
you an order, you follow it.
You don't question it.
Just like all my other agents
who work for me.
Are we clear?
Lou,
I respect you.
And believe me,
I appreciate everything
that you have done for me.
But I'm not like all your other agents.
I wake up every morning with
millions of nanites inside of me.
Now, if you want me
to follow every rule
and regulation to the letter,
then that's what I will try to do,
but if you ask me to do that,
then one day something
is going to give.
It'll be me.
Aston Martin V-12?
No, no, no. Way too small.
What did I tell you?
If you get a hundred thousand
dollar car for a mission,
it needs to be fast and comfortable.
That's my boy.
All right. Bentley Continental GT?
Please. That thing looks like a hearse.
Speaking of hearse.
By the way... thank you, son.
What else you got?
Oh, uh...
Mercedes Benz SLR Coupe.
Oh, give me a break.
I can run faster than that heap.
Really?
How about another Fresca?
